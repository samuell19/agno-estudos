[film strip clicking] [ominous music] [upbeat groovy music] [fingers drumming on table] [clears throat forcefully] Sorry, sorry. I'm just trying to track my stats. My last post didn't do as well as I'd hoped. Wait, the-- the turmeric latte? Mm-hmm. Oh, I thought that was so cute! Yeah, so did I. But then I only got like 20,000 shares. [moody music] 20,000 shares? Oh, you poor thing. Must be time to throw in the towel then, huh? No. 20,000 shares would have been huge for me like six months ago, but I have to keep growing, expanding, exploring new opportunities. The moment I get comfortable is the moment I get lost in the mix. Food blogging is very competitive and I have to keep up. Look, I get all that. But if you can't step back and appreciate all that you've already accomplished, then what's the point of any of this? You're right. I know, you're right. Here, my phone is officially down. You can even hold onto it for the rest of the afternoon. I am all yours. Don't mind if I do. [phone chimes] Oh, you got a text from-- Francois? [upbeat music] Since when are you texting Francois again? It's nothing. It's just a casual dinner here and there, just old friends catching up. Kacey, I just don't think that this is a good idea. It's tea time. Kacey, I just think that-- wow. This is so pretty! What is it again? It is called blue tea. It comes from the butterfly pea flower, and it's a Southeast Asian delicacy. A follower sent it to me. Well, it's gorgeous. Definitely good for a few likes at least. Here's hoping. [glasses clink] [pan sizzling] [dishes clatter] Can-- can someone play this for me? Yeah, just the man I wanted to see. Service! Ready to have your mind blown? Charcoal. - What? - Charcoal! A completely charcoal-based menu. Yeah, I don't think I understand. People love charcoal! Do they? Yeah, it's a detox thing. Look it up. I-- Kinsey, people do not come here to detox. They come here for sustainable high quality farm-to-table dining. That-- that is the whole reason I took this job. Well, you can't fight the future, my friend. And hey, need I remind you? That's my name on the door. So figure it out. I believe in you! [bell rings] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh! Yeah, by the way, there's a customer out there. He wants a word and I think he, uh, knows you? [door swinging] [gentle soothing music] Haha, Uncle Leo. Gavin, my favorite nephew. Oh come on, you're just saying that so I'll comp your lunch. Ah, I wouldn't dream of it. Food this good is worth every penny. Thank you. So, how's the publishing biz? Ugh. To be quite frank, it's seen better days. Yikes. Uh, sorry to hear that. What happened? Good content is hard to find these days. And it's tough to predict what consumers are going to be into from one month to the next. Well, uh, I may have a solution to your problem. Oh, really? Yeah, I've been meaning to talk to you about this for a while actually. I've been working on something. You-- you remember that old cookbook Mom used to have, the one that was barely held together by a string? You know, she used to scribble all her notes in the margins, constantly tweaking and personalizing [laughing] every recipe? How could I forget? Well, uh, I want to create my own cookbook as a tribute to her. Gavin, that's a lovely idea. I know it would mean the world to her. But what brought this on? Why now? Honestly, I've been feeling a little stuck here recently. I-- I'm ready for something new. I-- I want to put my own vision out in the world. And I feel like there is no room for me to do that here anymore. Oh, Gavin. You know I support you in everything you do. But I don't know if we're in a position to take a chance on an unknown author right now. OK. Well it was worth a shot, you know. Let me send you some samples. You can take a look at what I've got so far. And-- hey, I'd just be happy to get a little feedback. Absolutely. Anything for my favorite nephew. [laughs] All right. Fine. You win. I'll send over a free dessert. Oh, now we're talking. Yeah, I got you. Enjoy the lamb. You know I will. [restaurant patrons chattering] [soothing music] So, fill me in. What was the takeaway from the marketing meeting? Well, the report showed we are still thriving in the 60s and up market, and our children's section, nailing it. The Bear and the Whale was one of our all time best-sellers. Unfortunately, we are missing the mark when it comes to the highly lucrative 20 to 35-year-old demographic. So we'll publish a few more self-help books, maybe an inspirational memoir? They were thinking something bigger, broader. What are people between the ages of 20 to 35 actually consuming? [peppy piano music] Social media and blogs. Influencers have massive built-in followings which will translate directly into sales, enough to regain Bloom and Co's status in the publishing world. So let me get this straight. We need to publish a book written by an Insta-blogger in order to save this company? Precisely. OK. If you're sure that's what they want, then-- They seemed pretty adamant about this, Mr. Bloom. They've done the research and this is what sells. Well, OK then. What are my options? Here are the current top trending blogs that our marketing team thinks could make an impact on the numbers. Sophie Ronaldo, 1.2 million followers. She's all about vegan based fitness. No. [peppy music] Next. We have Miles Pastel. Not only is he super cute, but he makes art using only recycled magazines. How about this? Kacey Cooke, a.k.a. The Colorful Cook. Recipes are so beautiful you almost feel bad eating them. 1.5 million followers equals potential millions in revenue. Well, Kacey Cooke, looks like you just got yourself a book deal. [groovy blues music] The Colorful Cook's Primary Colors Avocado Toast. This isn't the same old avocado toast you know. Unexpected tastes and textures come together in this simple and quick culinary delight. [groovy blues music] [gentle music] Mmm. Mmm. [phone ringing] Gavin? It's Uncle Leo. I might have an opportunity for you. [peppy blues rhythm] Oooh! [laughs nervously] After you. Are you-- are you sure? It's just I have this big meeting to get to. By all means, yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. What can we get for you? Do you have any recommendations? I always trust my baristas. How do you feel about Chai? Mmmm, maybe something a little more mocha based? I got it. How do you feel about toppings? The more the merrier. One iced oatmeal double shot double fudge macchiato coming right up. [upbeat music] Hmm. [gasps] Oooh! Oooh, I am so sorry! Oh my gosh! Uh-- OK, don't sweat it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Oh, let me buy your coffee. It's the least I can do. Seriously it's fine. [sighs] Americano black please. [groovy blues music] Oh, it's you. Yep. You're Kacey Cooke. Yeah, hi. You're Kacey Cooke. Yep. Great blog. Thank you, that's sweet. I'm actually here to meet with Leonard Bloom. Oh great, you're both here. Come in, come in. Ooh Gavin, you get into a fight with your coffee this morning? Yeah, something like that. [sharp inhale] Take a seat please. First of all, I want to thank you both for coming in. No, thank you. I am so excited for this opportunity Mr. Bloom! Now that's the kind of enthusiasm we're looking for from our authors. And might I say, we absolutely love your blog. It's exactly what we're looking for. We want to capture you, your essence, on the pages of this book. Well, count me in. [chuckles] Good. There's just one little detail we need to iron out before we make it official. Oh, OK. Yes, anything. I've sampled some of your recipes and, well, I'm just wondering if maybe they might need a little tweaking. [playful music] Tweaking. Yes, tweaking. Just in the flavor department. The flavor department. Not that they're bad. It's just that they're not necessarily cookbook ready. Oh, OK I-- I see what you mean. It's just-- my recipes aren't necessarily gourmet. That's not really what my followers are looking for. They expect beautiful, fun, accessible recipes they can make at home. I'm-- sorry. Recipes can be accessible and still be gourmet. I'm sorry but who are you? Oh, right. I'm-- This is Gavin, my nephew. He's a brilliant chef, one of Chicago's best. We were thinking of bringing him on as a consultant. We believe he could elevate your beautiful, fun, and accessible recipes. I'm sure you're very good at what you do, Gavin, but I kind of consider myself a one woman operation. Yes, and look at how much you've accomplished so far. But if we want to go forward with this deal, I'm afraid your only option is to collaborate with Gavin. What do you say? [intense music] OK, I'll do it. Wonderful! [laughter] We'll be in touch. Gavin. See you-- Well, that went well. You think? Look Gavin, if everything goes well with this collaboration, it will make it easier for me to convince the board that you can handle your own book. Ugh. Let me think about it. Gavin, you know I'm your biggest fan. All I want to see is your cookbook published. Thanks, Uncle Leo. [clapping hands together] [WHISPERS] All right. [restaurant chatter] [door swings] Gavin! My man! We need to talk next season's menu. I sent you an email last week with some ideas-- Yeah yeah, no, I got your ideas. I really, really love the vibe you're giving me. But hey, check it out. Two words-- molecular gastronomy. What about it? It's only the hottest trend in food since avocado toast? OK, I thought we were going to do the whole charcoal thing though. I mean-- Charcoal? Charcoal is so two months ago, Gavin. Come on! We are so over charcoal! Mmm-hmm. So molecular gastronomy! Thoughts? OK, yeah. Honestly, Kinsley, my thoughts are that the people who come here want good food. They're not coming for the latest trends. Poor sweet Gavin. Listen, I know people got really comfortable with how things were run around here when my dad was in charge. But hey, see me? This guy right here? I'm in charge now, and I got my little finger on the pulse of the younger generation. Times are a-changing and we need to change with them, and that means creating stuff that looks good on the Gram. Right? See the more likes we get, the more customers we get. The more customers we get, the happier I am. And my happiness equals your happiness. And don't you want to be happy, Gavin? [melancholy music] Yeah, I do. I do want to be happy. Which is why I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry, what? Good luck with your molecular gastronomy. Wh-- uh-- excuse me. Get in here! You're head chef now. Uncle Leo, I'm in. [hopeful music] Gavin, hi. Please come in. Thank you so much for coming here. I just always feel more comfortable working in my own space, you know? Hey, uh, no problem. I think it's important that I get an idea of how and where you work before we get to the cooking itself. Oh, by all means. [playful music] So this is where the magic happens. So you're a chef? Uh yeah, yeah. Where do you work? I was at Kinsley's on Main Street. Oh yeah, Kinsley's. Great risotto. Thanks. You always keep your knives next to the stove? Yeah. Huh. So you're familiar with my blog then? Uh, yes, yeah. Any dishes in particular that stood out to you? I'm sorry. I lied. I haven't seen it. But I swear I'll get around to it. [chuckles] Um-- hmm. Have you been washing this with soap? I'm sorry, what? It's just soap can really damage the surface. It's better to boil off any excess food and then wipe it off with the towel. [fake chuckle] Yeah. OK, well thanks for that. No problem. So should we talk about the book? Yeah, let's hear what you have planned. Well-- ahem-- if you'd seen my blog, you'd know that in creating my recipes I like to utilize every color of the rainbow. Well, it's called the Colorful Cook. I kind of put two and two together. [nervous chuckling] So I thought it'd be fun to break the book up into five chapters-- breakfast, beverages, shareables, salads, and desserts. Each chapter will contain one recipe representing each color of the rainbow. And then of course we'll throw in some multicolored dishes just for fun. Yeah, that does sound like fun. OK. Look, you clearly don't want to be here. And quite frankly, I'm not so thrilled about this arrangement myself. But since we have to work together, can we at least try and be civil? Civil? Who's not being civil? I'm being-- I'm being civil. - Really? Because from the moment you walked in all you've done is judge me. I'm just trying to help. And what makes you think I need your help? I'm not saying you do, but Bloom and Co, the publishers of your book, think you do. So here I am. Well, my 1.5 million followers don't seem to have any complaints. Just saying that you can't melt cheese over everything and throw on some colorful fruit slices and call it innovation. Mmm, OK. Well, if that's the case, why am I the one with the book deal then? Listen, I can't speak on your food until I've tasted it. So let's settle this once and for all and why don't you cook something for me? Something for you. [chuckles] I'll do you one better. I propose a cook-off. - A-- a cook-off? - Yeah. A cook-off. You can start with the basics. OK, um, how about an omelet? Great. You're on. Noon tomorrow. May the best chef win. And then they said this Gavin guy had to be my flavor consultant. Can you believe that? Why don't they just get him to write the book? Because they don't want him, they want you. Look it seems to me that you have two options. Either you work with the chef guy and maybe learn something, or you say no to the deal and stick with what you know. You know, you're right. I'm Kacey Cooke. Cook is literally my name. Yeah, it is! And I'm going to make this guy the best omelet he's ever seen! That's the spirit. Mmm. [liquid spills] You OK? Maybe more caffeine wasn't such a good idea. Oh, here. You all right? Yeah, thank you. There's-- [laughs flirtily] so clumsy. Don't worry about it. I'll see you later. OK oh-- Bye. Bye, see you-- I just don't know why we had to come here of all places. Because they make the best latte art in the city. And I need them on my blog. It's guaranteed to get me more likes. What's this really about? OK. You know that guy that I was telling you about? [gasps] Was that him? [gasps] Was that Thomas? Yes, yes, don't look! Stop it! [WHISPERS] Yes, that was him. You know, for someone who likes romance novels so much, you sure have a way of avoiding it in real life. Well speaking of romance, shall we discuss the subject you've been so obviously avoiding? What? [fake laughs] I have no idea what you're talking about. Very cute, but I've known you for way too long. Spill it. It's just dinner with Francois. It's not a big deal. We're just catching up as old friends like I said. OK fine, he may have mentioned wanting to get back together. But I'm not sure I'm ready. I-- I don't know what to do. Look, I get it. He's a huge food critic, and you're the biggest thing to happen to food blogging since Martha Stewart. But does he make you happy? He has been putting in a lot of effort these days. And he can be really sweet. [sighs] I don't know, maybe I miss him. All I'm saying is if I were you, I would still have reservations. Well thanks to him, I do-- all the hottest restaurants in town. He wants to take me to Chez Marcel. Chez Marcel? Oh, OK, you're going. Not for him, but for the scallops. Ugh, I hear they're life changing. [sighs] Wow, book deal! Congratulations! Thanks, Francois. I just wish I didn't have to work with this guy. Right, the chef. What's his name again? Gavin something? I don't know. He's supposed to be a big deal. Wait, not Gavin Bloom? Yeah, that's him. Why, do you know him? I-- I wouldn't say I know him. We crossed paths. You know how it is in the biz. Right, the biz. How could I forget that you're such a hotshot food critic? Well, you're not the only one. So? Is that right? Just so happens that Chicago Post wants to do a two page spread about me and my career. That's incredible, Francois. It's nothing really, they just want to know how I got my star, here a few of my top recommendations, a bit about my history. Well, you deserve all the recognition. Thanks. Now with you, a soon to be published cookbook author, we really are quite the power couple. Francois, we're not a couple anymore. Come on, Kace, I'm trying here. I swear I've changed. I'm ready to commit this time. Now I know you still care about me at least a little, otherwise you wouldn't be here. You really won't give us another chance? I don't know. [sighs] I think I just need more time. And I need to focus on this book, my career-- I don't need any distractions. Well, just as long as you know I'm not going anywhere. Oh, what's this? Oui-- a little something as a token of our appreciation for your patronage. Well that is very generous but completely unnecessary. Nonsense. We saw what your last blog post did for Restaurant La Cache's business. Enjoy. [chuckles] Ooh, are those the famous scallops? I hear they're to die for. Nah-ah! You know I don't share food, sweetie. [sighs] Mmm. [gentle piano music plays] [door opens] Gavin. Kacey. Ready to get cracking? Ooh, good one. Hope you're ready to lose. Sounds like wisk-ful thinking to me. That's right! I've got egg jokes too! [intense funk music] So what do we have here? An herb and cheese omelet? It is. A little uninspired, wouldn't you say? Oh, it's all in the preparation. You'll see. Sometimes less is more. Hmm. And what do we have here? This is my classic sunrise omelet featuring multicolored bell peppers and an apricot chutney. Oh. Shall we? [dishes clink] [sighs] [gentle music] [WITH MOUTH FULL] Hmm. OK. Well uh, to start off, I have to commend you on your presentation. It looks exquisite. Thank you. Now I will say, I love bell peppers in an omelet. But next time, I would consider cooking them through first before adding them to the mixture. I'd also recommend using a classic tomato chutney. It will complement the cheese better. So, what do you think of mine? Well, um, you know, there's a little too much, uh-- Whoa. And you could have maybe-- um-- the cheese-- Cheese-- Who am I kidding? It's amazing. How did you get it so fluffy? And this cheese! [sighs] Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm not cut out for this. I-- I don't think I've ever cooked anything that tastes this good. Who's going to buy a cookbook from me? Wait, what about all your fans? I bet a couple of your 1.5 million followers will be-- Yeah, but what's going to happen when they try the food and they realize that I'm a fraud? You're not a fraud you're doing what you love. And it is pretty clear that you love this. I spent years in culinary school learning how to make an omelet this fluffy. It takes time and practice. I will be with you every step of the way, to make sure that your dishes taste as good as they look. OK. So where do we start? [hopeful guitar strumming] [birds chirp] [car door slams] Beautiful, isn't it? It really is. Hope you're ready to harvest some crops. Me, pulling carrots from the dirt? No, I don't think so. Come on. What are you, scared to get your hands a little dirty? [laughs] What does this have to do with the cookbook anyway? Well, you want to learn how to be a great cook. The key to great cooking is knowing where your ingredients come from and what's in season. For me, there's no more reliable source than my best friend's backyard. Wait-- your friends actually live here? - Yeah. - Huh. Tammy and Diane. We met at one of my first restaurant jobs, hit it off right away, bonded over our mutual passion for farm-to-table dining. And uh, of course they took it a step further by actually buying a farm. Huh. I guess that's pretty cool. Yeah, it is pretty cool. And it works out well for everyone. I get my pick of fresh ingredients and they get a little extra help on the farm. Hey! You made it! Finally! Hey, Diane. Nice to see you. It's so good to see you! This is Kacey. Of course, where are my manners? Welcome Kacey! It is always nice to have an extra pair of hands around the farm. OK! Come on, everyone! [inaudible] you, my love. These are for you and you are set. All right, let's do it, puppies! I apologize for my wife. She can be a bit intense during the harvest. You must be Kacey. Welcome to Daisybrook Farm! Thank you so much for having me. It's beautiful. I should warn you though, I've never done any farm work. I have no idea what I'm doing. OK, let's go, slowpokes! Day's not getting any younger! You're about to get the full experience. [laughter] - OK. Yes, carrots definitely. [inaudible] two. Oh, my favorite! - Oh! - Oh! Oh! Ah! You all right? Yeah, I guess I should look where I'm going on a farm. Um-- Oh, gosh. Gross! [chuckles] Thanks. Of course. [nervous chuckles] Poor guy. Babe, these turned out good. They did. Yes. Do you think we have enough? Um carrots? 100%. Carrots are very good. Wow! I don't think I've ever seen tomatoes this bright before. Aren't they beautiful? We should find a way to feature them in the book. Yeah, that's a really great idea. But the only problem is I kind of hate tomatoes. Oh, these aren't just any tomatoes. These are heirloom tomatoes. Their seeds have been handed down deliberately through generations of farmers, because they are the best of the best. Well, that's a really nice story. But that doesn't really change the fact that I don't like them, heirloom or not. OK. I'm going to go grab the basket. Come with me. [grunts] OK. Now everyone knows the classic pairing of basil and tomato, right? Of course. But have you tried tomato and dill? [tender music] I have not. OK, well you are about to. Some fresh dill. OK, give that a try. OK. I see where you're going here, but I don't know. There's still something about it I just don't like. Maybe it's the acidity? OK. Wait right here. I've got an idea. [tender music] OK, now this is fresh mozzarella. Now pair that with a crostini and a bitter green like arugula. Now you have a fresh take on a caprese salad. Try that out. [sighs] See, every recipe just requires a little give and take. Your ingredients should complement each other while simultaneously balancing each other out. I have to admit, that is quite nice. I'm glad you like it. So, what else goes with these magical tomatoes? Hey. [laughter] Everything looks so beautiful! Um, do you mind if I snap a couple of photos as inspiration for the book? By all means, snap away. [playful music] [shutter clicking] [gasps] Love it. [gasps] Perfect. These all look so delicious. I don't know which salad to try first! It's a real toss-up! [groans] OK. [laughter] Thank you, Kacey. I like to think that salads are one of my specialties. I love working with ingredients that I can grow myself. Oh, OK, try the tabbouleh. It'll change your life. [silverware clinks] Thank you. Gavin? Oh, thank you. Holy cow! [cow moos] Annabelle, that is enough, thank you! It's not always about you. [laughs] I think this is one of the best salads I've ever tasted. What's your secret? The secret is simplicity and working with what's in season. When the ingredients are this fresh, the flavor speaks for itself. I like that. I think I might have to quote you on it. Oh, don't quote me, quote Gavin. He taught me everything I know about farm-to-table cooking. He is basically the reason we bought this place. Is that so? Mm-hmm, oh yeah. You are in good hands. Gavin is the best there is. Oh, you can say that again. The steak at the Wallflower was-- [chef's kiss]. Oh, Wallflower. I don't think I've ever been. When did you work there? It was a long time ago, uh-- So I would like to raise a toast to the two of you embarking on this new endeavor together. I, for one, cannot wait to try some of your colorful creations. Yes, cheers! Cheers. [glasses clinking] V, business is booming. Thanks! I think the community is really responding. I'm really proud of you. Oh, how did the farm thing go? It was actually really fun. I learned a lot. And things with Mr. Consultant to simmer down? Turns out he's not so bad. Francois actually knows him. Oh, Francois knows him. Well, he must be great. Will you lay off Francois? I just wanna figure things out with him. I'm actually supposed to meet again for dinner this week. Well, have fun with that. Hey, uh, what's Mr Consultant's name again? Gavin Bloom. Why? What are you doing? [laughs] This is Mr. Consultant? He's so cute! This is a strictly professional relationship. Oh well, doesn't have to be. I have a lot riding on this, OK? I can't have any distractions. Look, if a guy this cute walks into your life, you have an obligation to go for it. [playful music] Um, V? Yeah? What are you doing? It's Monday, it's not Tuesday. I'm not following. [WHISPERING] It's Thomas! He's here! I don't have any recommendations and-- and I'm wearing this sweater! Why did I buy this sweater? Hey, slow down. List of recommendations? [wheels squeaking] OK. So every Tuesday, he comes in to buy a new sci-fi book. And every week, he asks me for a recommendation. I know nothing about sci-fi! I'm a historical romance girl! So I've been doing a little preliminary research so that when he asks, I would have something to suggest to him, but now he's here! I don't have my list! And I'm wearing this sweater! I honestly can't imagine things getting much worse. OK, V, breathe. You are a beautiful, intelligent caring woman. Any guy would be lucky to have any conversation with you, sci-fi recommendations or not. I can't just go over there and talk to him for no reason. Might I remind you that you own this establishment? Besides, a guy this cute walks into your life, you have an obligation to go for it. Oh, I hate it when you use my own words against me. What can I say? You're very wise. - Hey, V. - Hi! Hi. Hi! Um, I like your sweater. Thank you, it's new. No, it-- it isn't. I've had it for a long time. I just-- I never really wear it. I like yours too. Um, thank you. Can I ring you up? Yeah. I come bearing gifts. Ooh, coffee, amazing. Come in, I've been busy. Ta-da! Oh, wow. That is great. What is it? It's a mood board. I made one for every section of the book. This is breakfast, obviously. I'm sorry, a-- a mood board? Yeah, you have to have a mood board. It's a source of inspiration to focus your vision. A roadmap, so to speak. OK. So what are we looking at here? Well for blue, we should do the Under the Sea Blue Algae Smoothie obviously. Obviously, yeah. And for red I was thinking we'd do a pomegranate acai bowl. And for orange I was flirting with the idea of doing a peach and orange crepe. And finally for the rainbow portion of the chapter, I've been really inspired by the whole rainbow bagel trend. So I was thinking we could do our own take on it by doing rainbow scones. So, what do you think? I love it. Really? Yeah, yeah. It's-- it's fun, it's fresh. You've got variety. I think they'll love it. Amazing! Well, shall we start with the scones then? Let's do it. Ooh, haha-- what is-- what is this? Um, food coloring. No, we-- we can't use this. What? Why not? Because it's synthetic and unnatural. Okaaay. What's your alternative then, chef? Because in case you haven't noticed, color is kind of my thing. I'm not saying that you can't use color. I just think there are better, more natural ways of doing it. Come with me. I've got an idea. [gentle guitar strumming] OK, smell that. What am I smelling? What do you mean, what am I smelling? Nothing compares to the smell of fresh strawberries. I remember-- it reminds me of summers and I'm like-- you are not listening. Sorry, sorry. It's just, I've really fallen behind on my posts. Come on. You can afford to take a day off. That's the thing. I've been taking a lot of days off, and my followers have noticed. The numbers have taken a real hit. I thought the whole point of writing this book was so that you didn't have to do all this anymore. It is, but if I don't do all this, I lose my followers, no one will read the book, and all of this hard work will have been for nothing. Gotcha, gotcha. Just let me finish this post and I will be right with you. O-K sent. Now, what exactly are we doing here? OK, we are here because you need to make food coloring. And what better way to make food coloring then with actual food? OK, take this for example. Now I know you've used turmeric before. Hey, has someone been reading my blog? Yeah, yeah, I skimmed. I skimmed through it. Anyway, turmeric is one of the most pigmented roots available. OK, Picasso. How do you make pink? Oh, easy! Beets can make anywhere from a light pink to a rich magenta. Blue. It's right there in the name. Blueberries. What about purple? Blackberries. Well, don't you just know everything. I wouldn't say I know everything but um, yeah-- almost. No seriously, this is really impressive. You should really be the one with your own cookbook, or at least your own restaurant. Here let me, uh, let me take that for you. [tender music] Um, did I say something wrong? Oh, no, no. Sorry it's just-- I actually did own a restaurant once. Oh! Yeah, it was a long time ago. But didn't go exactly how I'd hoped. You know, it's funny how this business is. One bad review and that's it, you're toast-- pardon the pun. Well, um, I'm sorry to hear that, Gavin. It must have been really difficult. Yeah, it was. But helped me realize that running a restaurant, while being the dream you know, it was also a lot. The business side completely took over and I didn't have any time for what I loved, which is cooking. Well for what it's worth, I'm really glad your journey brought you here. I don't think I could do this without you. Well, thank you. But you should give yourself a little credit. And for what it's worth, I'm happy to be here too. [liquid pouring] Ow! [winces] Ugh! What happened? Oh, it's just a little cut. It's no biggie. [running water] Let me see. Really, it's no big deal. Come on. It's-- Aw. Where's your first aid kit? Uh, second cupboard. [zipper zipping] OK. [nervous chuckle] We'll just apply pressure, and good as new. [gasps] Um, so how is the pink coming along over there? Uh, why don't you take a look for yourself? Oh, it's perfect. Right? Who knew was this easy? Right? If only more people knew there was a natural way to color your food. Why can't they? You're right, everyone should know how to do this. We can put it in the book. We can have a sub-chapter on how we made all of our incredible dyes from scratch. That-- that's what I'm talking about. But before we get ahead of ourselves, we have to see if they're any good first. Shall we get started on the scone batter? - Yeah. - Yeah. [chuckling] OK. [playful music] Oh, look at them, they're perfect! OK, so once we narrow down the favorites from the tasting, we will be able to finalize the layout of the book. Sounds like a plan. Mmm-hmm. Speaking of books, I noticed you jotting some stuff down in that little notebook of yours. What's that about? Uh, I know-- this? Well, I always keep one of these on me. You never know when inspiration is going to hit. So what, you're just walking down the street, and all of a sudden a recipe idea pops into your head? [laughs] Yeah, sometimes it's a full recipe. Sometimes it's just an idea. Something to go home and experiment with. Can I read it? [gentle music] Uh-- honestly I've never shown it to anyone before. Oh yeah, that makes sense. You know it's just-- I don't even know if it would make sense to anyone but me so-- Totally understand. OK. Uh, I'm so full. I don't think I can eat another bite. Oh Francois, what are you doing-- right, we had dinner plans! We sure do. And we better get moving or we're going to miss our reservations. Right! Francois. Yeah, we've met. Right, I thought I recognized you. Gavin, right? - Yeah-- Gavin Bloom? Gavin. This guy is one heck of a chef. OK, well-- I better get going. Thanks for the scones. Sorry to break up the tea party. Well, I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah, sounds good. Why don't you pop these in some water? We can get going. I got a cab waiting. A bottle of the Languedoc and the seven course tasting menu, my good man. Hope you're hungry. Mmm. So how's the article coming along? Eh, you know, it's-- it's going. It's weird having someone write about me for a change, kind of intimidating actually. Oh? How so? Well, I, I just-- I'm not sure I make a compelling subject for an article. I-- I talk about food. That's what I know. I don't talk about myself. Well, I'm sure you'll be great. Just speak from the heart. Yeah, I, I guess you're right. I'll figure something out. [classy music] So, you seem to be getting along pretty well with Chef Gavin. Yeah. The book is really coming together. How do you two know each other by the way? Oh, uh well, you know-- oh. Yes, thank you. Mmm. [slurps] Hm. [swishing] [smacks lips] this will do. Thank you. - Well? - Huh? How do you know Gavin? Oh you know, it's a small world. Once you've been doing this as long as I have, you get to know all the chefs on the scene. Why do I feel like there's more to this story? OK, fine. You got me. A few years ago there was this restaurant called Wallflower. [playful music] It was your review that shut down Gavin's restaurant? Not intentionally. I had no idea that review would affect his business so drastically. But what can I say? I just find this whole farm-to-table thing a bit uninspired-- passé. Uninspired? Nothing about Gavin's food is uninspired. Don't you think that's a little harsh? It's a harsh industry, Kace. It's not personal, just business. It's never just business, Francois, not to me-- or Gavin. Well, I guess we just see things differently. You're right. We do see things differently. We see a lot of things differently. Wh-- what, you're leaving? Let's be honest, Francois. You and I are very different people and it was never going to work. It was never meant to. But we both need to make our peace with that. [funky music] Mmm. Mmm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Yup, this is it. Mmm-hmm. Definitely my pick for green, no contest. Coconut pistachio ice cream for the win. So that just leaves rainbow. And I know exactly what I want to do. It's a take on my grandmother's confetti cake. She was an artist and her use of color really inspired, well, my entire life really. [laughs] And I was thinking, to spice it up we could dust it with some edible sprinkles. I mean, I love the family recipe part, but-- What? It's just uh, sprinkles and sparkles-- really-- something about eating sparkles just doesn't feel right to me. Don't you think that sprinkles are just a little overdone? What? No! You can never have too many sprinkles. Eh-- You know what your problem is? You don't know how to have fun with food. [guffaws] OK. I have plenty of fun with food. Mmm. In fact, I can prove it. Follow me. [upbeat music] Oh, come on! You can't seriously have a problem with sprinkles! Everyone likes sprinkles! Everyone likes sugary cereal, too. It doesn't make it good. Debatable. So, this is your idea of fun? You'll see. We're almost there. [laughs] [gentle inspiring music] [gasps] It's beautiful. Isn't it? This is where I come when I need a little inspiration. I can see why. But I am struggling to see how this solves our sprinkle problem. OK. What do people love about sprinkles? They're pretty, they're fun, they add a pop of color. Look around-- pretty, fun, pop of color. Flowers? You can't eat flowers. Says who? OK, almost all the flowers found in this field are edible. Really? Mmm. Except that one. I'm total-- I'm totally joking! It's edible! It's edible. [laughing] We can mix this into the buttercream icing for my grandmother's confetti cake. I hate to say it, but you're right. This is so much better than sprinkles. And I'm sure my grandmother would approve. I'm sorry, did you just say I'm right? Don't let it get to your head. Ooh! And these will be the perfect toppers for the lemon Earl Gray petit fours. OK, and hear me out-- this is the perfect color combination for the endless summer salad. Inspired. [gentle music] [sighs] This is perfect. How did you find this place anyway? Uh, well my mom used to take me here every summer. We'd spend the entire afternoon harvesting wildflowers so she could use them for her many, many creations. So you got your love of cooking from your mom then? Yeah. She was a real inspiration to me. She-- she grew up on a farm, and she was only used to working with what was available to her. And what wasn't available on her own land, she would source from the community around her. At the end of every season, her and the other farms would have this big harvest meal. I watched her bring countless people together through food, and I knew that I wanted to do the same. Wow. Your mom sounds like an incredible woman. She was. She passed away a few years ago. I'm so sorry, Gavin. Thank you for bringing me here, for sharing this with me. It's my pleasure. I'm happy to pass on what my mom taught me. That's why I was so determined to write this cookbook. She always said, if you're working with what's in season, you've got to get creative. She had this old beat-up notebook she would write all her recipes in, constantly changing and tweaking them. That's what inspired me to keep a notebook of my own, and after she died I thought it would be a nice idea to turn it into a cookbook as a tribute to her. That's beautiful, Gavin, really. You have to write this cookbook. And I promise I'll do anything I can to help make that happen. Thanks, that means a lot. Anyway, enough about me. How about you? What's the story behind your cookbook? What do you mean? Like all books, every cookbook has an underlying story within its pages. Well, I uh-- [phone ringing] Oh. Hold on, it's Leonard. Hello? Kace, how's the cookbook coming along? Great. Two chapters down, three to go. That's great, that's great. Look, something's come up and we're going to need the final draft sooner than expected. Sooner than expected. How much sooner than expected? Two weeks. [playful music] Two weeks? I know it sounds a little tight, but another food blogger just announced plans to launch her own cookbook by the end of the month, and we want to beat her to it. Think you're up for the task? Um-- sure. Two weeks, yeah, no problem. [laughs] Amazing. I knew I could count on you. Tell Gavin I said hi. Your uncle says hi. Two weeks? What happened? I'll explain on the way. We have to go. OK, uh, so what are we doing here? You were right. Every cookbook needs a story, and I have no idea what mine is. Uh, hey Kacey, what are you doing here? Gavin, this is V. She owns this place. She also happens to be my best friend. V, Gavin, chef extraordinaire. Great setup you have here. Thank you, I like it. Where are your cookbooks? Uh, those three shelves. Honey, is everything OK? No, everything is not OK. I have no idea how to write a cookbook. You can't just throw a bunch of recipes on a piece of paper, bind them together, throw in some pretty pictures, and call it a day. It needs a story! You're right, you're right. Uh-- this book does need a story, but it needs to be your story. And you're not going to find it in the pages of somebody else's book. Great stories come from memories, experiences. So if you want to find your story, got to look within. [gasps] He's here. Who's here? Oh, he's here! - I'm sorry, who's here? - V's crush. Shhh! Hi, V. Hi! [laughs nervously] How are you? Did you like the book? Yeah, yeah, I'm loving it so far. Anyways, we're handing out some free samples of our new blonde roast and I thought you might like one. Thank you. Hey, I knew I recognized you. You-- you work at the local press. Yeah. I love that place. The best Americano in the city. And they make the most amazing latte art. Hey, I have a question! I'm writing a cookbook and I need a little inspiration for my beverage section. And I was wondering if it would be possible to set up a private tasting, maybe a barista training, you know, just to brush up on my skills. For the three of us, of course. V here loves latte art, isn't that right, V? Yeah-- Yes, yes. I can-- I can do that. Um, how's tonight at 5:00? Does 5:00 work, yeah? We'll be there. Yeah? Mmm-hmm. - Yeah! - Yeah? OK, great. I'll-- I'll see you guys then. Bye, V. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Bye! Nice. You said that good stories come from experiences, and this is going to be an experience. A-ha. [chuckles] [high-pitched squealing] Uh, no, Gavin. You-- you want to make sure you keep the spout fully submerged in the milk, and then slowly pull it out as you froth. OK. I can whip eggs into a meringue by hand. I think I've got this. Well, actually there's a bit of a-- [high-pitched squealing] I've got it! - There's a bit of a-- - Just-- A bit of a tech-- technique-- a little bit of a technique to it-- I know there's a technique-- There's a-- [whooshing sound] Technique to it. [clears throat] [laughing] Guess you can't be good at everything, huh? Oh, OK hot shot. Why don't you come here and show me how it's done? Don't mind if I do. [frothing sounds] [giggling] [carafe banging] [liquid pouring] Wow, uh-- you're a natural. Thank you. OK, V, you're up next. Oh-- oh, no, I-- Go on. Don't worry. We'll take it one step at a time. OK. Um so-- Yeah, just like that. [frothing sound] Great, perfect. Now just tap it on the counter to get rid of any bubbles. Now, the fun part. [gentle music] OK, um-- Let me show you. [nervous laughing] Guess I need a bit more practice. It's perfect to me. Would you look at the time! Oh, we've got to go-- uh-- - Ooh-- uh-- To the, um-- The prep for the tasting. Prep! Prep for the tasting. - Yeah. - Tasting! Yeah. You got to taste it. - Yeah. Which-- oh! By the way, Thomas, you should totally come to. V will give you all the details, won't you V? Uh, yeah, sure, sure. Yeah. I will do that. Yes. Great! Great! Well, I'm sorry we couldn't stick around. Thank you so much for having us, Thomas. - Yeah. - This was enlightening. Great. Likewise. [nervous laughing] OK! OK, yep. Off we go! Bye! Bye. I don't know about you, but I feel so inspired. I can't wait to get back to work! Are you sure that's not the three shots of espresso talking? Maybe, or maybe it's the thrill of budding romance blossoming before our very eyes. They are pretty cute together. Are you kidding? They're perfect. They're a match-a made in heaven. Oof! [laughing] You are quite the romantic, aren't you? I don't know about that. I think I just know a good thing when I see it. Well, uh, it seems like you and Francois have a pretty good thing going on. Oh, no. I mean we did but not anymore. Oh. Yeah, we were together for four years. And one day out of nowhere he broke up with me. Sorry. No, I'm sorry. Francois told me about the review. I don't understand how anyone could criticize your food. Taste is subjective. My food wasn't to his liking, then he has the right to express that. No I-- I just think sometimes he doesn't realize the weight that his words have. I'm sorry. It's fine, really. I hope that that didn't play a part in your decision to end things. No. It was going to end eventually. This was just the wake-up call I needed. Yep. [gentle music] [frothing sounds] Kacey? Come on in. Is that a milk frother I hear, my nemesis? Yeah, I guess I couldn't hear you knock over all this racket. I was so inspired yesterday. I came up with the most brilliant idea for the beverage section. What is it? Well, I used the food coloring we made the other day to dye the milk, and look how well it turned out. Oh. It's beautiful. [gentle music] Thanks, I think so. You have that. I definitely don't need any more caffeine. OK. You don't like it? I should have warned you. It's a new recipe. It's my take on a pumpkin spice latte. I used cocoa instead of nutmeg. I love it, actually. It-- I just wasn't expecting it. Really? You like it? I do. Usually I'm a plain black coffee kind of guy, but this is delicious. You know what? It actually just gave me the best idea for a recipe that I've been working on. Me? Really, I did? Yeah. It's a twist on my mom's old caponata recipe. Caponata? What's that? Yeah, it's like a Sicilian vegetable stew. My mom would make it every harvest dinner and since she was working only with what was in season, each time she made it, it would change, sometimes for the better and-- sometimes for the worse, but-- So what's the twist? Oh, uh, it's a-- I was thinking a dash of cocoa powder. Ooh, cocoa caponata. It's got a nice ring to it. I have you to thank for the inspiration. Well, I guess we both have a lot we can teach each other. OK, uh, so what's the plan, chef? We've got two weeks and a lot to do. Well, we better froth some milk! [upbeat folk music] [chopping] You got it. Hey! Oh-- the rest of that-- Lokk at that. It definitely-- Right here-- Flows. This is like a-- this one? Yogurt bowl. Perfect. [gentle romantic music] [water running] Oh Gavin, please stop. I already feel bad enough as it is. I'm falling asleep on you. How long was I out for? Only a couple of hours. Honestly, don't feel bad. You've been working hard. You needed the rest. Oh and-- [dishes clatter] by the way, the lilac muffins are ready. Oh, look at those! They're perfect! Oh yeah, they do look great. What is is? I'm just not sure I love them. Are you kidding? Look at them! They're adorable! They should be on the cover of the book. Yeah again, they look great, but they taste kind of weird. Yeah. I'm not sure how I feel about a floral muffin. Uh-- They're fine. You really want people to describe your cookbook as fine? They're great. Mmm. Well I guess that's a matter of opinion. And who says your opinion is right? Fair point. I guess we'll have to put them to the test tomorrow at the tasting. Oh man, that's tomorrow, isn't it? It sure is. We have so much to do and so little time. How am I going to pull this off? Don't worry. I will be there bright and early tomorrow morning. Get it done. We got this. Oh, Gavin. What would I do without you? [gentle saxophone] Do we have the watermelon feta bite? Check. The crimson cranberry punch? [pop country song plays] Check. The lilac muffins. Unfortunately, we have those too, yes. Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something? Uh, well, there is one thing. Oh no, what is it? No, relax. I got you something. You got me something? Don't get too excited. It's just a small thing. [gentle romantic music] Kevin, is this-- Yeah. Uh, I made you a copy. You've been so open in sharing your process and your recipes with me. Thought I'd do the same. But I thought you said you never showed this to anyone. Well, I've never met anyone I trusted enough to show it to before. And besides, you-- you were right. I forgot how to have fun with food. I guess since my restaurant closed and I started working for other people again, I lost touch with my creativity. But since I met you, I've been inspired to experiment more with my food, my cooking, to think outside the box, to play. Anyway, um, consider this a token of my appreciation. Gavin, I don't know what to say. - Kacey, we're here! - [gasps] Uh-- Wow, Kacey! It looks gorgeous back here! I totally agree. [country pop music playing] - Oh. - Hi, Kacey. - Hello! Oh, thank you. - Hi Gavin. Hey. Thank you for having us. No, thank you for coming. We've been dying to get some feedback on these new recipes, and I hope you don't mind me snapping some photos while we're at it. Oh well, I'm ready for my close-ups! And I'm ready to eat. Everything smells incredible. Great. Uh, let's get you started with some refreshing cranberry punch. Oh. Thank you! Say free! Free! [shutter snaps] Mmm, this is incredible. I've never tasted anything like this! It's the saffron. It completely transforms the smokiness of the Gouda, doesn't it? I have no idea what you just said, but all I know is I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. [laughs] OK, well then mission accomplished. Mmm. All right, I hope you're ready for the next course, my very own lilac muffin. - Ooh. - Ooh! OK! [plates clatter] Uh-- let's see here. Ooh-- Wait! Hold it right there. [shutter clicking] Adorable. You can eat now. Oh, thank you. [pop music playing] [sighs] - It's uh-- - Mmm-hmm. Um-- - It's very-- Floral. Mmm. In a good way? Um-- Maybe. Oh, no, it's-- it's OK. We want honest feedback. Um-- Not-- it's not my-- my favorite. OK, well then that's it. We have our answer. We have to scrap the lilac muffins. [scoffs] But you're the one who inspired me to tell stories through my recipes, and these muffins tell a story. OK. Let's hear it. What's the story? [sweet tender music] Growing up, every weekend I would go to my grandmother's. And she had these two beautiful lilac trees in front of her front door. Every time I smell lilacs, I think of her. OK, but-- why muffins? My grandma loved muffins. She always had a fresh tray waiting for me when I'd walk through the door. I just liked the idea of combining those two memories. I, I-- I love where your head's at with this. But you have to consider the flavor profile as well as a story. Close your eyes and think back to those weekends at your grandma's house. What else stood out to you? Warm summer days by the pool, fresh cut grass. After long days of running around on the lawn she would prepare homemade lemonade. It was so refreshing. [music intensifies] That's it! Excuse me just one moment. [laughing] Could she-- oh, OK. Don't worry about it. Yeah, sure, all right. I used the lilac syrup from the muffin as a sweetener in this homemade lemonade. A little garnish. Ooh! Very nice, very nice. Oh, it's beautiful. For you. Thank you. Mmm, thank you! Thank you. Thank you. [gentle music] Mmm! Mmm! I'll second that, this is delicious. It's perfect. I mean, lilacs always remind me of going to these botanical gardens I went with my aunt in the spring. I love the botanical gardens! Especially when the lilacs are in bloom. Well maybe I could-- I could take you some time. That would be lovely. OK. This-- this is what it's all about. Two flavor profiles that when combined, transport you to a special memory. To telling stories through food. Hear, hear. [glasses clinking] Cheers. Cheers. [gentle upbeat music] Wow. I cannot believe how much of Francois' stuff you still have! I know. I was so upset after the breakup, I never got around to going through his stuff. Or maybe I was holding on to it just in case we got back together. But that's not going to happen, so time for a fresh start! Well, I'm very happy for you. Thanks. I'm happy for you. You and Thomas really seem like a great match. Oh, check out this film and I captured of you two the other night. Oh, that is so cute! Oh, can you send that to me? No need. It's already up on the blog. That's right. And how are the followers responding? The numbers are already up by 2,000. That's great! So does this mean you finally get to take a break for a minute? Hardly. I will take a break when the cookbook is on the shelves. That deadline is coming up quickly. What's this? Ooh, that was a gift from Gavin. Oh, really? Yeah, it's the notebook he keeps all his recipe ideas in. He made a copy for me. Wow, look at this thing! There's a story behind every recipe. This is incredible! Yeah, and there's a bunch of old family recipes in there too. Cocoa caponata-- mmm! Sign me up. Which reminds me, I am starving. I better get going. Thomas is meeting me at Rosina's for lunch. OK, well Francois should be here any minute to pick up his things. Have a bowl of pasta for me! [laughs] V, nice to see you again. Francois, a pleasure as always. Hi. Hey. I just finished boxing up all your stuff. Great. Thanks for doing that. Hey did you remember to throw in my sister's book? She's been asking me about it for like a year now. Oh right, thanks for reminding me. I'll go grab it. [ominous music] [sighs] Found it! It was hiding on the top shelf, but here it is. Great. Thanks. So, how's the article coming along? Oh, great. I'm actually just on my way to the final sit down with the journalist now. Oh well, good luck with that. I'll um, keep an eye out for it. Thanks. Good luck with the book. Thanks. [upbeat music] I did it! I mean, we did it. I sent in the final draft, and I think that is cause for celebration. [platter clinking] Everything OK? Chicago Post published a profile on Francois. Oh, right. How was it? It was an interesting read, especially the part where he told the story of my mom's caponata recipe. [ominous music] What are you talking about? I don't understand. Just read it. My mom inspired my passion for farm-to-table cuisine. She had a famous caponata recipe that people would travel far and wide to try every season. Gavin, I-- how did this happen? I was going to ask you the same question. Gavin, I had nothing to do with this. Kacey, you are the only person I have ever shown that book to. And now my mom's legacy is being passed off as someone else's. I know how this looks, but Gavin, I swear-- I just-- I need some time to process this. But Gavin-- Kacey, good night. Congratulations on the book. [melancholy music] [sighs] I have no idea what happened or how he got his hands on Gavin's notebook, but we have to make this right. Do you have it on you? It's right here. Ah. According to copyright law, you can't technically own a recipe, but you can own a story. But how do we prove that it's Gavin's story? It's all right here, and it's dated before the article came out. OK, so what do-- what do we do next? First we copyright the notebook itself. Because it predates the article, it gives full legal ownership of the story to Gavin. So we present the post with the copyrighted materials and get them to credit Gavin for the story. Now you're getting it. That way Gavin gets all the recognition he deserves. Exactly. Speaking of which, I think I might need to make a few adjustments to the final draft of the book. Do you think that I could have an extra day? What kind of adjustments? You'll see. I promise it'll be worth it. The printers won't be happy, but I could-- we can make it work. And oh, Kacey, I know he might be upset right now, but he'll come around. [hopeful music] Thanks, Lenore. I just wouldn't want the Chicago Post's reputation to be at risk. I look forward to seeing the amendment. Thanks again. Bye, now. [phone beeps] [phone beeps] Alexandra, get the printers on the phone. We have some last minute changes to make to The Colorful Cookbook. Hi, you've reached Gavin. Please leave a message after the beep. Hi, Gavin. It's me, again. [nervous chuckle] Um, I really need to talk to you. Um, it's about your notebook Um-- and it's good news this time, I promise. Um-- look, I understand why you're upset. I would be too, but if you could call me back, I can explain everything. Um, anyway, it's the book launch on Saturday. Hoping to see you there. This book is just as much yours as it is mine. Anyway, yeah, call me back. Um, it's-- it's Kacey by the way. Um, OK, bye. [phone beeps] [mournful music] Gavin, let me just start off by saying how incredibly sorry I am. You sharing your book with me and everything. The fact that I could let it fall into the wrong hands is unforgivable. That being said, please forgive me. If I've learned anything from our time together, it's that no recipe will ever taste right if you don't use the right ingredients. And Gavin, without you this book would be like a cake with no sugar. OK-- I apologize for the terrible food analogy but what I'm trying to say is that I couldn't have pulled this off without you. Love Kacey. [hopeful music] [phone rings] [phone chirps] Hey. Go to Kacey's live. Her what? Go to her livestream! Livestream! Go to it! Would you just-- I am telling him-- her livestream. I told you, she loves him, she loves him. Diane, shush shush shush! Hey, we are going to let you watch this in private. OK, bye! And of course, none of this would have been possible without my co-writer Gavin. Gavin, I don't know if you're watching, probably aren't. But if you are, I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Gavin inspired me to be better, to push myself, to find my story. He reminded me that food is about community and creating new memories and sharing with those you love. And that's when I realized that the story within my book is a love story. Whether it's enjoying a matcha latte with a friend or cooking up an old family recipe or sharing a meal with someone special, it all circles back to love. Awww! And hopefully, for all of you watching, you'll get that from our book. Because I know that the memories I made with Gavin will last me a lifetime. So um, swing by [inaudible] bookstore and pick up your copy today. We'll be here all day. [sweet music] Ugh, ugh, so he's a no-show. Eh, I'm sure he'll show up. I hope you're right. You know, this is just like that part in Escape from Mars the Next Generation where Venicula is captured by the Martian fleet and [inaudible] is waiting by the asteroid. You know, Escape from Mars. The book. You-- you bought it a few months ago. OK. Um-- I have a bit of a confession to make. I'm not really into sci-fi. [guffaws] Hold on, I-- I'm confused. Then why did you come here once a week for four months to buy a book you don't even like? I mean-- [inaudible] obvious. I came to see you. You did? Yeah. I mean, the first time we met, I just happened to be standing in the sci-fi section. And you were so enthusiastic about this one book, I-- I just had to buy it. And I would just come back on a weekly basis to hear your recommendations, and I-- I could listen to you talk about anything, books or whatever, all day. Um, well I have a confession to make too. I know nothing about sci-fi! I read dozens of books just so we would have something to talk about. This whole time we could have actually been talking about books we liked. Yeah-- Like for example, I like historical romance. Historical romance. Gavin! My favorite nephew! Hey. It's about time you showed up! Yeah. Better late than never, huh? Let me be the first to congratulate you on your roaring success. Today's turnout was twice what we anticipated. And the partners at Bloom and Co couldn't be any more thrilled. Not to mention, your recipes being published in the Chicago Post and the popularity of your cocoa caponata-- I know. [laughs] It made it easy for them to sign off on your book deal. Wow. Well done indeed, young man. You deserve it. Thank you. Hey, thank you, Uncle Leo. I am so proud of you, Gavin. Well, I don't know how I'm going to repay you. Oh, there'll be plenty of time for that. But right now, you have some, uh, business to attend to. All right. Ugh. [music swells] Oh. [laughs] [sighs] Who should I make it out to? Gavin Bloom, please. I'm a huge fan. Gavin, you came. Did you get my letter? I am so sorry! You don't have to apologize. I should have listened to you. I said I could only share my notebook with someone I really trusted, and I never should have doubted you. You-- you are the most trustworthy, honest, hilarious, talented, kind person I have ever met. And not only do I trust you implicitly with my notebook, I also trust you with my heart, if you'll have it. [music swells] [applause] [laughs] I'll, uh, I'll take that as a yes.
