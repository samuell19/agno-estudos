Hey Donitz! - How far is it now? - Three more days yet. You're going where you're going at the wrong time, you know. That was the meat waggon. And you just missed it. You got a good look at it back there. I saw you. Well, that's your ration till the next time around. Cheap, like everything else in this country. Still, that's in keeping. What did you say? I said the workmanship is cheap. Which it is. And that disturbs you? Of course it doesn't disturb me. On the contrary. Give me a hand. - Where is he? - In my hut. You're the new chap, I take it. Yes, I'm new. - German? - Donitz. Yes, yes, we've been expecting you. - Are you Mr. Kramer? - Good heavens, no. My names Macey, Major Macey, I'm British, well, English. I'm number two here. But I'm still on the reserve, you know, Royal Engineers. I was commissioned on the field of Alamein. We are, we beat you at Alamein. Yes, I know. Funny you should think I was Kramer. Possible mistake to make. I've got a job to do, can't hang around here all day. You bring the retirement present with you. That's the company's golden handshake right here. They pay you well and bury you well if they get you in time. I'm pleased to meet you, my name's Tom Fletcher, and you're sharing a room with me. - Thank you. - To tell you the truth, it was nothing to do with me. Not that I mind, but it was the Major's sense of humour. He's not exactly subtle, you know. He's the sort of man who has to take his trousers down to get a laugh. You've already met the major, I saw him talking to you. - Yes. - Take it from me, he's full of piss. Is this all your gear? - Yes. Well hang on a minute, I'll help you. - Thank you. - I just have to collect something here. This is my 14th. Just, do you like birds? - I don't dislike them. I always had a bird at home, ever since I was a kid. Always had a bird in the window. Different kind, though, you got your right sort out here. I feed them well, feed them like a baby, and yet they still. Hope you got the wind behind you on the way back. You better be careful you're not the next. It will be pleasure to take you. I would have thought they'd bury him here. Too bloody true, should have done. He was a Catholic, he wanted the full treatment. And old Santos there saw that he got it. Of course, your coming out here helped. If it hadn't been for your coming today, he'd of had to settle for Bondy Beach. Me, I don't care where they bury me. I've got no more thoughts on the subject at all. After you. - Thank you. There's your pit. We'll get you your own fan in the morning, you'll need it. Thanks. Look at this poor wee thing. He's not gonna last long either. I don't know what it is about me, but I'm the kiss of death where birds are concerned. You can say that again, eh? Look, we got to share a room, but don't think I want to share your life, you know, I mean, you want to tell me something, I'll listen, but not a curious type. Not like some people, you understand? It's important to get these things straight from the beginning, you know? Oh, sorry Mary. You know, when I first came out here, they put me in with Major I'm on the reserves Macey. I hadn't got the sand out of my boots before he told me his whole bastard born life story. I mean, in the first five minutes, you know? I'm sitting where you are now, and he's telling me how his father caught him with the butler's daughter on boat race day and all this carry on, you know? I said I don't care if you hooked the butler. I still don't want to hear it. So I tell you something, this poor we bird's gonna be as stiff as old Bart there in the morning. After all the stoop I get to carry in the cabin. I'll try with some water. That's a bird's eye view of Sydney. - Yes, I know. - Oh, you know Sydney, do you? No, not really, I went there once. That's okay, mate, I'm not asking. As I said before, you don't want to tell me anything, don't tell me. Here, look at this, he's taking a sip. Well, won't press our luck. Look, I have to go to the wireless room and report his departure, I won't be long. You just make yourself at home, and then we'll go and have some grub. You always check everybody in and out, do you? Too true, mate, this desert's a big place. And it's 200 miles to the next petrol pump. That means a lot to old Barder you know. If that truck doesn't arrive by morning, he's in dead trouble with the Almighty. You, you religious by the way? - No. - Didn't mind me asking, did you, I mean, you just say if I step out of line. Fletcher, will you pass the port to our German friend? I'm so sorry, some people never learn the right way. Thank you, I don't take it anyway. Anyway, it's a good thing to drink something in this climate, you know. It keeps the bugs at bay. The important thing is to keep the bowels open. Some people don't talk about bowels at the meal table. - Some people don't read. - I'm not reading, I'm looking at the pictures. I'm looking at Miss September. She's six months out of date in the calendar, but she's ahead of her time in every other way. You likey, huh? Shorty, little bit? You're crude, Fletcher. Everything about you is crude. That's right, that's right. So work your port. Do you play poker? - I've played here. What do you play, stud or straight? - I don't play anymore. - You'll play out here. Kramer likes it, he names the stakes too. He plays a mean game of poker, does Mr. Kramer. When do I get to meet your Mr. Kramer? You don't meet him, he sends for you. Real Buckingham Palace stuff. You notice he doesn't eat with us. He doesn't even use the same toilet. Though that may be a blessing in disguise, you never know. Now, don't rush to tell him tonight, save it for the morning. I'm going to bed, I've got a heavy day tomorrow. You'll be starting in yourself, I expect. I'll show you the ropes as soon as possible. Good night, Donitz. - Good night. I'll slip Miss September under your door after lights out, all right? I just have to have a go at the major, he just bloody asks for it. I don't mind him being a snob, but you know what really gets me about him? No, I have no idea. His letters. He gets a stack of them every month when the supply truck comes in. A dirty great stack. Hey! - Mr. Kramer will see you now. - Where do I go? - The end hut. - Okay. And Donitz, don't believe everything that Fletcher tells you. I have a rule, Major, I don't believe anything anybody tells me. Come in. Welcome to Station Six, Donitz, you're lucky. It's the best station in the company. Is it? Didn't they tell you when you signed up? No, they told me very little. Not that I was interested. Oh yes, it's quite the best station. You weren't interested, you just signed. - That's right. - Have you read what you signed, you read your contract? Oh yes, I can read, yes. - Where do you come from? - Hamburg. Yes, quite a gay city these days, I'm told. I wouldn't know, I haven't been back for some years. Tell me Donitz, as a fellow countryman, would you consider yourself a good German or a bad German. I've never thought about it. Well, think about it now. It's important for you to know, is it? It could be important to you too. We want to know where we stand, don't we? We're going to have to live together for some time. Let's put it this way. I have had Germany. And I've had Germans. No thanks, I don't smoke. - Were you in the war? - Yes I was. - Were you taken prisoner? - No. I was, in Russia, there's another sentimental race. You are lucky, Donitz. You could say that. I could and I do. Are you generally lucky? I'm not unlucky. Till now, eh, struck a dull patch, as the Major would say. Signing on here for five years I wouldn't exactly call lucky, would you? Were you drunk when you signed? I don't drink. So you don't drink, you don't smoke. You don't get taken prisoner. Who do you go to bed with? Oh, I'm old-fashioned, I prefer women. Right Major, finish it off, do the easy bit. Think you could do this fast, Donitz? No, I don't think I could. I'll let you try it next time. You know, I can tell when there's a break in the pipeline miles down the line, and pinpoint it down to within one mile. And all done by listening to that little old pump. Isn't that right, Major? - Sir? I say I'm like a water diviner, aren't I? You certainly are sir, it's uncanny, it's quite uncanny. I nurse my pump, Donitz, and I treat her like a baby. In the nine years, she's never stopped on my account. Check the valve sleeve with the Major. Always double check. German efficiency, you know. I guess you'll have to get some more. I've just taken the last. That's the Major they expect. Get over! Sorted through all the best fruit too, have you? You can't annoy me this morning, Fletcher. I'm in a very good mood this morning. Kramer let you clean his shoes, did he? You're slipping Fletcher, you cracked that one last week. You'll have to find some new material. No, I've just come from the wireless room. Personal message from the chief of the Imperial General Staff was it? Oh no, much better than that. There's a mail truck on its way, Fletcher. Actually on its way. Letters, Fletcher, letters from home. From human people. It's stone cold! It's the mark of a peasant, you know, to shout at servants. - Really, you're a walking bloody encyclopaedia, aren't you? Yes, you can't annoy me today, Fletcher, it's mail day, remember? Yes, thank you, I got the message. Well, never mind, I'll save you the stamps. - Morning. - Morning. - Coffee? - There's some fresh coming. Fletcher just shouted the order. Are you expecting any letters, Donitz? - Letters? - Yes, mail from home. I just heard there's a mail truck on the way. I don't think I'm expecting any. It's a bit early. I expect your friends will only have just got your address. I doubt that. I didn't send it. - I see. You're like our friend Fletcher here, are you? You don't mind not getting any mail? No, I don't mind. What's so special about letters anyway? I beg your pardon. I said what's so bloody special about a few handouts? Don't tell me you get a stack of love letters. It's your one track, Fletcher, one dirty track. You wouldn't appreciate the kind of letters I get. No? All right, well, let's put it to the test, shall we? I'll make you an offer. I'll give you one month's pay for one of your letters. - You'll do what? - I'll give you cash. One month's pay for one of your letters. That's simple enough, isn't it? Donitz, do you know what he's talking about? I can't say it any plainer, can I, I'm willing to pay cash. Simple business transaction. You get a lot of letters, I get none. Law of supply and demand. I'll buy one from you. I've never heard such an extraordinary suggestion in my life. - Well never mind that, you've heard it now, are we on? Are you seriously suggesting that I sell you one of my letters? - That's right. - For one month's pay. - In cash on delivery. No, no, no, come on now, what's the catch? No bloody catch! What sort of letter do you want? I don't mind, when they get here, you spread them out on the table and I pick one. - Just one. - Yes. - Unopened. - Of course unopened. What do you want, blood? Is it a deal? - I don't know. I have to think about it. - No, no, no, no, I want an answer now, now just think. One month's pay, you can add it to that fortune in your little black book, and all you have to do is share something you've got a lot of with one of the peasants for hard cash. All right, yes. Right, Donitz here is the witness. See you later then, and no cheating if the truck gets in before I get back. He's mad of course, I always suspected it. You should worry. - Hi. - Hi. - Got any beer on ice? - Should be some inside. - You're late, driver. - Yeah, I poured out once. It's damn hot out there. Well you've got the mail now, I take it. Okay, if I have a drink first? No, I'll take the mail now if you don't mind. There you are, help yourself. Okay if I have a drink now? What, oh, yes, yes. - I'll take those, shall I? - What? Just to see fair play, Major. You're not suggesting I was gonna cheat? No, no, of course not. Just that I have to say it is a bit mad. We don't want to take unnecessary risks, do we? It would be better if I was a stakeholder. Major, could you spare a moment of your valuable time to finish the job at hand? Yes sir, right away sir, just getting the mail. Don't keep him waiting, Major. Well, I wasn't gonna cheat, you know. No. Okay, where are they? - I haven't got them. - You lying ponce! I saw the truck out in the desert. I didn't say they haven't arrived. I said I haven't got them. - Well, who has them? If you'll give me half a chance, I'll tell you. I wanted everything to be aboveboard, knowing the way your subtle mind works. So I asked Donitz to hold them for us, he's got them. That's right, I've got them. - Put them all on the bed. - Should I? If that's the way he wants it. Major, cash on the nail. All counted, but check if you want to. Oh, don't take all night, I want to get changed. Don't panic, Major. You got paid. Don't panic. Right, that the one? No Major, and don't hurry me. Yes? No. Oh, good God. - I'll take this one. - Thank goodness for that. You're quite sure? Well, that's a relief anyway. You're happy, are you? - Yes, thank you. Well, where are you going? Where do you think he's going? He's going to read it, I suppose. He could have read it here. Anyway, I wanted to see which one he'd chosen. I don't think that's in the rules. What rules? It's my letter. - You took the money. We'll see about that, that's absolutely ridiculous. I mean, a joke's a joke. - I'm sure you'll sort it out. - I certainly will. By the way, I forgot to tell you. Mr. Kramer wants to play poker tonight. He told me to tell you. Donitz, you heard that did you? Yes. Well, that means we all play. - Does it? - Yes, you see. Mr. Kramer says when he wants to play. And we all fall in. - You may fall in, Major. I don't have to. I don't think you quite understand. Well, yes I understand, but I'm not in the army any longer, Major. German or British. Well, you have to tell Mr. Kramer yourself. That's right, I'll have to tell him. - Where's Fletcher? - You're asking me? In the hut, I suppose, where I left him. - Isn't he coming to dinner? - I have no idea. - What's he doing? - Reading, I think. - No. - Reading a letter. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening, Major. Good evening gentlemen. We're one short I see. - Yes, I'll go and get him, sir, is think he's in his hut. Don't you trouble, Major, I'll send Martin. It's no trouble, sir. I figure if I go, it's quicker than explaining. Donitz, since you are the new boy here, and this is not a new deck, perhaps you'd like to shuffle. No, no, that's okay, you shuffle. You trust me? No, it isn't that I trust you. It's just that I'm not playing. - You don't know the game? - I don't think you quite understand, Mr. Kramer, I said I wasn't playing. On the contrary, I don't think you quite understand, Donitz. Nobody refuses an invitation on my station. If you don't know the game, we teach you. You know the game, you take a seat. It's a house rule, is it? What happens to people who break the house rules? I break them. Over a period of time of course. You've got the idea. Time's on my side out here. Well, in that case. I'd better learn the house rules, hadn't I, I'm only here for five years. I think perhaps in the circumstances, I'll take advantage of your offer and shuffle the pack. Fletcher? Fletcher. Come on, man, Fletcher. About time too, Kramer's waiting to play poker. I'm ready. Why didn't you turn up for dinner? I was reading. Should we go? Did you enjoy my letter? You mean my letter, don't you? The letter then. Did you read it? Who was it from? Who was it from? - Yeah. - What makes you think you ought to know that? - What do you mean? I don't ask you who your mail's from, do I? What do you mean, it's all my mail. Well, except my letter, remember, I paid for it. Well, I'm entitled to know who it's from. You're entitled to exactly nothing, Major, a month's pay, remember that was the price. Are you saying you're not gonna tell me? That's right, it's a private letter to me. Come on, don't let's keep Mr. Kramer waiting. Shut the door after you. Good, let's go. Straight draw, nothing wild. Cut. Up to you. No. No. Cards. Honest three. I play these. Major. - One please. - Open both ends, Major? Dealer takes none. See him, Major, keep him honest. Do you mind not talking? I'll see that. 10.50. At which point I took a run. That's 50 in, up 50. - What are you doing, Major? - Apart from wetting your pants, that is. - I'll, I'll go away. Your 50. It's up to 200. I thought you didn't play, Donitz. I was persuaded. Against Mr. Kramer's better judgement. What's wrong, Major? Get some bad news from home today? Straight draw. Mahmoud! We're nothing wild. All right, let's have a little wild game. Deuces wild. - Sorry, what was that? Deuces wild. You know, Major, twos. And remember Major, there's no ace like your own ace. Why do you say? Well, well, if it's going to be a friendly game. Here you are. And up 50. What's the matter, Donitz? Don't you fancy it this time? - Oh yes, I fancy. What am I gonna do with this load of rubbish. I don't know whether to bump it or chuck in. I'll go easy on you, I'll chuck in. I'll stay. Just the three of us. Cards. - One please. - Major? - Two please. Watch it, Major, you're playing with my money, remember. - Will you shut up! - Yes, do shut up, Fletcher. How many is the dealer taking? Dealer takes none. - It's up to me, I believe. - All right, your lead. 50. 50. And up 50. Your 50, and 250. - That's 300 to come in. - Come in. 300. And, five. - Five? Hundred. Are you with us, Major? - How much is it to be? - 750. Unless you want to raise. - 700? And 50? I know, no I, I think I'll just finish. I'll just see that. I don't know about seeing just yet. Your 500, and another 500. Your 500. And 1,000. - 1,000? That's 1,500 to see. No. No, no. Here you are. 1,000. Piece of paper, Santos. And another thousand. And again. Well, I'll be nice to you, Donitz. I'll just see you, as you'll be working for nothing after that. Don't take care to be nice. I'll see you. Four aces. And four more. I guess we share the pot. Since when? House rule. Equal hands, 50-50. What's equal about these two? I've got three natural aces showing, Mr. Kramer, three to your one. Don't the house rules take care of that? Funnily enough, they don't. Oh, let's make a new rule? You take that money, Mr. Kramer, I'm going to break your wrist. We'll finish this later, Donitz. Okay. Watch out! How is he? Not too bad. Is he dead? Tell me if he's dead. No, he's alive. I promise you. Don't promise. I want the bastard to die. How are they? He's still unconscious and she's sleeping. Have they found a doctor yet? Well, I haven't checked for the last half an hour. Kramer was still trying then. I say, do you think they're man and wife? Do I think what? Do you think they're married? She's got a wedding ring on. I don't think she is, you know, not from what she said. I think they're just travelling together. You worked this out all by yourself? Beautiful. - Yes. Yes, very fine features. - I was talking about this. - What is it, American? Very vulgar, I think. Give me that. Oh, he's American, is he? Fleming. I used to know a Fleming, but he, he spelt it with an I. Major! Kramer wants you. - Do you have to shout? Listen, if they can hear me, they should worry. You're quite insensitive, aren't you, Fletcher? That's right. Have a boiled sweet. Run all the way! I may have to do another deal with Major Macey. - What about? - His bed. It's going to have a certain historic value from now onwards. What time does the bloody depot come on the air usually? Well, it's early sir, but they should have been on for the last hour. If not, they'll definitely be transmitting at 1800. Fat lot of use that'll be. Well, I've never known them to miss an evening transmission, sir. We'll have a corpse on our hands by then. You hang on anyway, if you get the lazy bastards, tell them to send a doctor. And a coffin. What do you think you're doing, Donitz? You don't get paid for playing with cars. Take Macey's shift in the pumphouse till I relieve you. Fletcher, get out on the road, and see what damage they did to the markers. Could you get me a drink? I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were awake. What kind of a place is this anyway? Are you the right person to ask for a drink? I can get you a drink, what would you like? I'd take it easy if I were you. Don't worry, I will. Did you put me in here last night? - I didn't personally. - I was just asking. If you had, I was gonna say thank you. You know what happened, do you? Sure I know what happened. I haven't lost my memory or anything. How's my driver. I'm trying to get him a doctor. He needs a stomach pump and a new set of brains. He needs a doctor. Is it still in order to ask you for that drink? Of course, just tell me what you want. And I'll go and get it myself. Oh, I'll leave that up to you. I'm sure you'll make the right choice for me. Morning. How do you feel? I feel like somebody who was in a car crash last night. How do you feel? All the better for seeing you. You're the travelling rep from Elizabeth Arden, I suppose. Right, first time. Did I get out of that? Yep. Oh well, it was still under guarantee. Don't go away, we need men like you. - Good morning. - Good morning. I'm just finishing. - Don't hurry on my account. I hate eating alone. My name's Catherine Starr. Are you a member of Mr. Kramer's staff? Oh, that coffee's filthy. So I guess you get used to it, huh? I bet you have to get used to a lot of things, living out here. I don't suppose you have many people drop in on you for breakfast. No. All work and no play, is it? Is this the manner you speak to your husband? - Am I boring you? - No. Well, just say so, won't you? I'm not used to the everyday routine of a monastery. - You had luck last night. - I'm a lucky person. God was with you. No, I wouldn't go that far. My driver just lost his nerve at the last minute. He was trying to kill us, you see. He was trying to kill both of us. But he's not very good at anything. Repeat, anything. Excuse me. I have to work. - Sure. What were you doing in there? What I usually do, eat. I don't want you hanging around there. Haven't you got any work to do? I just finished work and now I'm starting again. I'm moving into your hut for a few days. So that the young lady can have some privacy. You ought to find out her name then. You should never give your room to a stranger. Her name is Catherine, Catherine Starr. You wanted to know how he was? - Yes, how is he? - Not too bad, surprisingly. And she's in Kramer's hut. Kramer's? That's right. To be a leader of men, you have to take the lead, don't forget. Cheeky bastard. He's talky is he? - You are not, I suppose. - Oh, I am, yes. But then I admit it, unlike some people. Sorry I didn't knock, Major, I'd forgotten you were here. We'll have a giggle tonight, eh, all us boys in the same dorm, you'll think you're back at Eton. I'm sure you dislike the arrangement as much as I do. Fortunately it's only temporary. So you don't mind me getting undressed in front of you, do you? I'm not going to be treated to another series of your coarse jokes, Fletcher. I'm going to go and relieve Mr. Kramer in the wireless room. That'll be nice, you'll enjoy that. Oh, and Major. To save you that trouble in the future, what you wee looking for, I keep it on me. I don't know what you're talking about. Do you want the light on, sir? What, oh, yes, yes, do. Any joy so far, sir? Nothing at all. Station six calling Medina, over. Well, I'll keep trying, sir, you can rely on that. You're taking a long time over it tonight. That's right. Could it be that I have an ulterior motive? What about it though, eh? What about what? I've been thinking about her all day. What about those Charlies, eh, what about them? Come on, don't give me that, you bloody icefield, and your cheeks, your mind's been on your work all day, I suppose, huh? Sure I've thought about her. Would you say she's got class? She's got class, hasn't she, eh, you can tell that. You can tell by the way she treats people. She'd eat you, I bet she'd bloody eat you. All my life I wanted to get a piece like that. You'll never meet her though, you never get near it. I used to see them in restaurants, getting out of dirty great cars. You know, always snooty looking, sort of dissatisfied, with some fat ponce trailing behind them. How do you get them, that's what I've always wondered. How the hell do you get them, mate? Money, Fletcher, that's how. You're right, you've got to have money. I bet her skin's cool. - Who is it? - Kramer. Well. Come in, it's your room. Don't you have another name? Kramer is such an ugly name on its own. - Peter. - Yes, that suits you. Well now, Peter, what can I do for you? Your friend wants to see you. Does he? He isn't my friend, he's my ex-husband. I slept on your bed, it's very comfortable. Not as comfortable as you're used to. Do you have a cigarette, Peter? I've got a full pack on there. But I don't have a match. But still, I'm sure it's good for me to go without. I don't usually go without the things I want. Your friend seemed very anxious to see you. He can wait. And he's not my friend, I told you before what he was. Do you usually travel with ex-husbands? Not plural, I've only had the one. He tried to kill us last night, you know. - I got that impression. - Deliberately. He's been talking about it for a week now. He's a great talker, is our Jimmy. The performance is never up to the talk. Do you know men like that, Peter? I've met some, yes. He married me when I was 16. He met me on a Thursday. He talked solidly until the Saturday morning, we were married on the Saturday afternoon by special licence. But you didn't stay married to him. No, I didn't, did I. Sometimes I feel sorry for him. Sometimes I call him. I call him long distance. And he goes out and buys a car, charters a plane, he has money. And that talks too, you know. Would you mind putting that out, Peter? That's the bit that gives you lung cancer, I'm told. Can you show me the hut? I'll wait for you, after you've seen him, perhaps you'll have dinner with us. Yes, thank you. Have you the cigarettes? Thank you. You'll need this lighter too. - Hello, Kitty. - Hello Jimmy. Hey listen. I've been thinking lying here. Don't think, Jimmy, it isn't your strong point. You need to save your strength. How are you darling, you're not hurt, are you? You know me, indestructible. - I didn't kill us, did I? - Didn't you? Well, if you hadn't had said that last time, I might never had tried it. But, the point is, I did hit the brake. And you think that solves everything. No. No, I know it doesn't solve everything, but it does give us another chance. Look at me! Just come a little closer. You don't have to sit down, just come a little closer so I can see you properly. You remember our first year? It wasn't all wrong then, was it? You know, maybe if we had had the baby, you know, if I hadn't had talked you out of the baby. You didn't talk me out of it. I didn't try to stop you, did I? Hold my hand. - Don't beg, Jimmy. I don't mind what else you do. But don't beg. - Just hold my hand. - I'm going to dinner. I'm hungry. - I'm not begging! When have I ever begged? Gentlemen, you all know Miss Starr, I believe. We haven't actually been formally introduced. My name is Fletcher, Tom Fletcher. - How do you do? - And this is Mr. Santos. Yes, we know one another. And someone who hasn't been here long enough to learn any manners, we have Donitz. Would you care to sit here, Miss Starr? Yes, thank you. I'm sorry to disturb your routine this way. You're joking of course. - Do you mind? - Please, we don't toast the queen here, in Macey's absence. Where is Macey? He's still playing Marconi, I think. Allow me? It's a terrible habit. Smoking during a meal. - I don't know, I think I'll join you. How about you, sir? - Thank you no. - Beautiful action. - Yes, it isn't mine. - Not yours? - No, Mr. Kramer very kindly lent it to me. Oh dear me, I've made a social blunder, how awful of me. And on your first night too, I'd never have taken the liberty, sir. I'm so terribly sorry I'm late. I do hope you haven't been kept waiting, Starr. No, nobody missed you, funnily enough. Rather the point is that I have managed at long last to contact headquarters and medical help is on its way. - You did get through then. - Yes, yes I got through. I had some trouble, but I did manage to get through. I'll see you get a mention for it, Major. Devotion to duty. Did you order the wine, Major? Yes, Fletcher, as a matter of fact, I did. Miss Starr, it's a pleasure to have you with us. Yes indeed. I want the survey done today. Including the sector boundaries. Major. You and Fletcher take one sector. You two the other. And I want a full report. - Yes sir. We know who's going to make another survey, don't we? We know all night you sleep. Fletcher. Fletcher. What? I'm prepared to buy it, you know. Buy what? I'd like my letter back. I'm prepared to pay you for it. What you paid me, plus a reasonable profit. Did you wake me up just to tell me that? I'm serious, Fletcher. I should never have entered into the arrangement. I realise that now. Fletcher. - The answer's no. - What do you mean no? You've no option in the matter. It's my property, and I demand its return. I have every bloody option, and shut up. It's too hot to argue. You ruined my sleep, I was having a lovely dream. I demand it back. I was just getting to be interesting. Yes, you think I'm joking, don't you? Well you wait, you wait. I've got ways. Did you ever meet a girl like her before? Yes. Just like her. Three months, four days. That's how long since I've had a woman. And she was a pig. Just a pig. Oh, scratch my back. Where? There. Tell me what you were thinking. Thinking. I was thinking of leaving here. I've been here a long time. Too long. Before, I was thinking of leaving. But there was nothing to leave for. Nothing to go back to. Nothing to start with again. If you really want to know what I was thinking, I was trying to find the courage to ask you to make me leave. Can you give me that? well, I'm glad you found everything intact, Major. Nothing on the perimeter. Santos! No. Fine. You had a successful day. Everything all right here, sir? Yep. We'll go and get cleaned up for dinner then, sir. What time would Miss Starr like to dine? I don't think she'll be dining with us. She said she'd rather stay in her room. The heat get her down today, did it, sir? I wouldn't know, Fletcher, your guess is as good as mine. Perhaps not quite so good, eh? Thank you Donitz. I mean, why get rid of us for the day? We did a bleeding routine maintenance check about a week ago. No, it's all bent. You're not still going on about that, are you? Listen Major, don't give us the crap. I know what you think about all day, and it isn't El bleeding Alamein. You're the really unhealthy type, you are. I bet if you ever get home, you'll be in the News of the World before you get through customs. Yes, you're crude, Fletcher. Everything about you is crude. Sure I'm crude, I'm dead crude. I don't resent Kramer getting a bit, good luck to him. What I resent is him not sharing it. You don't I suppose, it never crosses your mind. You've never given that bint over there a passing thought I suppose. I happen to respect women. Put some sand down, I'll tell you my war experiences. I respect women, what's that got to do with it? I respect them so much, I'd do my nut for them, just to be near one, that one, right now. I've had more woman than you've had hot sandy dinners. Some I've bought, and some have paid me, and gone on paid me. - Yes, I can believe that. Don't give us the la-di-bloody-da pastor part, it's ladies night at talk H. You don't know what I'm talking about. - You think not? - I bloody know not. You forget, I've had the privilege of reading your correspondence. I've got your number, Major. I've got your number. I'll get you a pair of boxing gloves for Christmas. Catherine? Catherine, it's me, Peter. Catherine. Boy, get my jacket. No, no, no, my jacket. That's right. Bring it over here. You want to earn some money? Money, you want to earn some money? I want you to get something for me. - Am I disturbing you, sir? - No, what is it? Once again, it may be nothing at all, but I just thought I ought to bring it to your attention. Due to somewhat unusual circumstances prevailing, last night... What are you talking about, what about last night? Well, Fletcher was talking about our guests, in particular the young lady, Miss Starr. I don't think he's to be trusted. What do you mean, talking? Well, it may be nothing in itself, sir, he's always foul-mouthed. But it was more than that. I mean, he was out of the room last night. What I mean, is that we don't want any trouble, do we? - Out of his room? - Yes, yes, I happened to wake up and I noticed his bed was empty. He was away, some time. As I say sir, there may be no connection at all, but I just thought I ought to tell you. I hope you think I did the right thing. Yes, Major, thank you. I'll keep an eye open. - Will that be all, sir? - Yes, thank you. - Right, sir, I'll be, I'll be in the pump room should you want me. I'd do time for a piece of that. You may have to. Did you get it? Hello, darling. Are you feeling better? - How about you? - I'll live, you know me. Come on, sit down. I haven't seen you. They being nice to you? - Who? - The people. Men. They're fine, very polite. - What does that mean? - Just what I said, polite. They haven't made any passes? You can't leave it alone, can you? I just wanted to ask, you know, but honestly, I like for other men to admire you. But they're polite, you say. Of course, they're not really you, are they? Aren't they? You're the expert on these matters, are you? I'm the standard work of reference. I still love you, you know. Do you? That's why I do all those crazy things. Like the other night. It isn't that I mind losing you now and again, but I just couldn't lose you forever. I mean, I am getting better, aren't I? At least I am making an effort. How are my friends? - Fine. Have you taken good care of them? - It's too hot in here. - We'll turn on a fan. I'll come back later when it isn't so hot. Well, don't go yet, I want to tell you about all the plans I've been making. Don't go yet. Don't make too many plans, Jimmy. I'm not a great one on plans, you should know that by now. I'll come back later when it isn't so hot. Kiss me then. I'll come back later. - What are you trying to do? - Hello, Peter. What are you trying to do to me? Do to you, nothing, why? - Cover yourself up. - What for, I'm decent. Cover yourself up, or get inside. Don't give me orders, Peter. I'm not on the payroll. I'm asking you, Catherine. And you know why I'm asking you. Don't push it, Peter, don't take anything for granted. I don't like anybody giving me orders. If I wanted to sit out here naked, I'd sit out here naked, and you couldn't stop me. Catherine, I'm asking you, please. Oh, that's better. I like it when you say please. Well, now you've all got something to look at. You can look for the last time, Mr. Kramer. You've got something to say to me? No, sir. I'm happy in my work, how about you? Anything wrong, sir? What's wrong, what happened? Turn on the light, the shutter's closed. That's better. I don't like receiving apologies in the dark. You think I've come to apologise, do you? Well, you can say it nicer than that. They'll come in the morning to take you into Biskra. And I'm going to come with you. What about Jimmy? Tell him, you've told him before. It shouldn't be so difficult. I still don't know why he clobbered me. I mean, all right, so I was showing out a bit strong, but then a whack, yeah, no messing. It was almost as if he thought I'd, I mean I'd like to, don't let's kid ourselves. But I'm not her type, she's not interested in me at all unfortunately. Why would he think it, eh? It's this place. It's this place. We've all been here too long. - To do what? I don't know what's happening to any of us. Yeah, what are you mumbling about? What pearl of wisdom is that? Nothing, it doesn't matter. You know what we want, don't you? What day is it? About time the old waggon came around again, isn't it? It must be, at least you know where you are. Personally, I'd always thought the old thrill of the chase was a bit overrated, you know, give me the dead set anything. I still don't know why he sorted me out there. What are your views, Martin? As a member of the same peace-loving race, how would you read it? Huh? Hey Major. I don't want you to get alarmed, but we're alone together. Our Martin's not in the dormitory. - Yes. - What do you mean yes? I just told you a very interesting piece of news. Get out. Is the car here, darling? No, not yet. It's on its way. Be here soon. I've got something to tell you before it gets here. Well, all right. You can tell me. I'll make it easy for you, shall I? I always have done, haven't I? - Yes, I suppose you have. Well now, don't look so wary. I told you I'll change. I'll make it especially easy for you this time. You hit the wrong man, Kramer. Is that all you came to tell me? I thought you'd like to know. How very considerate of you, Martin. Oh, we are on a first name basis now. Why not? I can afford to be generous tonight. I can even forgive you your gambling debts. We never did finish the game of poker, did we? Didn't we, I know that I had the winning hand. And the funny thing is, Mr. Kramer, I've still got the winning hand. We have drawn the same cards again, but exactly the same cards, and I can still beat you. You really think so? Well, I'll put my cards on the table, because this time, I don't mind you calling me. You see, I'm leaving here. - Yes I know. You do? Well, what you don't know is that she's coming with me. You've got that in writing? Look, Martin. I'm too old to kid myself, I know that this is not gonna be like in song lyrics. But I drew my cards, and I'm gonna play them. If she meets anybody at all when she leaves here, it'll be me. I'll even double the bet. You're not only too old to kid yourself, you are too old to kid her. Go ahead, ask her. - You're lying. Am I, you are not sure, are you? You don't know whether I'm lying or not, but the point is you care. You care, Kramer. That's right, prove it. Major! You don't have to buy it back, it's only a printed reminder. One of your subscription's overdue.
