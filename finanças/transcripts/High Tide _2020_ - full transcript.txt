Listen, why don't you guys go? I will stay behind... HIGH TIDE Shall I change the music? - If you want to. - Okay. - Good choice. - Much better, huh? Can I have a kiss? - Here. - No, thanks. - Have you drunk too much? - No, not one drop. You really like fucking, don't you? What? How can you say that? By the way you dance. It that a good pick-up line for you? I'm sorry, I put my foot in my mouth, I meant no offence. Please, forgive me. Want some? Cocaine? No, wine, alcohol. The guys and I have been drinking all day. I just didn't want you to know we'd been drinking at work. So you wouldn't think we're drunk while we work. We did a good job, didn't we? - Yes. - I'd better shut up now. No. Go ahead. You just surprised me there. You surprise me, Weissman. You surprise me, too, Laura. - I didn't expect you to be like this. - Like what? Never mind. - No, say it. - Forget it. Come on, tell me. Tell me. Like what? I thought you were a bit stuck up, or so I've heard. That I'm stuck up? I shouldn't have listened to gossip, I'm sorry. Look at that! And what do you think of me now? Quite the opposite. Am I super approachable? "Super." I got to take a piss. I'm a very... a very nice girl. Any other woman would have kicked you out. I was expecting another answer. What answer? That you love a good dick. What made you say that? Who do you take me for? I'm sorry. Can I have a drag? Want some? No drugs in my house, Weissman. Sorry. I was kidding. Nice tits. I'm not good at this. -What? -I think I heard a van. I don't want the guys to see me up here. No, it wasn't the van. I'll get up. I'm getting up. Did you get any sleep? No. Did I snore? You did. -Sorry, I have a stuffy nose. -It's all right. -You have an allergy, too, right? -Yes, I usually have it in the morning. -Did you have that on last night? -No. It was this. -It's practically the same. -No way. This is a sweater. I can't find my panties. - Here they are. - Give me. Okay, I'll get going before the guys come. - Shall I make some maté? - No. Just go. - How about tea? - It's okay. You can go now, really. How are you travelling? By bus, there's a stop on the road. It's nearby. Laura, it was amazing. Sure. I'll call you. - Come again? - I'll call you later. Hey, where's my watch? Where can it be? Don't worry, it'll turn up sooner or later. Seems the guys came, left the tools, and took off. Do you think they saw us? I can't say. - I'll go before they come back. - Okay. It's so cold. Look what I found. It was nice seeing you, Laura. Same here, Weissman, it was nice seeing you. See you. Weissman? You came back? Why are you standing there? We're turning off the power, ma'am. Okay. Go now! Go away! Tenderloin. Three steaks, please. - I have something to tell you. - What? I did it with Weissman. - Did what? - I fucked him. - What? - Yeah. - Weissman? - Yes. - You've got to be kidding. - I'm not. - You screwed up. - No way, no. You won't believe it. He's like a sex machine. Unstoppable. I'll take some skirt steaks, too. And blood sausages. Three, please. Besides, it was huge. -Sounds a bit too much. -Not for me. What are you doing inside my house? -I went to the bathroom. -What's wrong with the outhouse? Do you mind? What about him? What's he doing in my kitchen? Toto! What are you doing, man? You can't get into my house while I'm out. Or while I'm in. Nobody gets in without my permission. Am I being clear or not? Step back. Your foot. What's up, dude? - What's up, man? - All good? Here, man. Let's go, bitch. - Morning. - Morning. Weissman wasn't feeling very well. He told us to start without him. - He's not coming today? - He's staying at home. With his family. Ma'am! Careful, don't fall in there. Or we'll have to bury you. Why is that hole there? -It's a composter. -A composter? Toto! Mind your manners. I don't want any garbage in the middle of my garden. It's not in the middle. - It's behind it. - It's better from behind. It's in the regulations. - Like, which alterations you can make. - Or who you can fuck. We can't cover it. Lau, honey... Maybe I should go over there and help you out. I know it's not easy for you dealing with people. Especially builders. Remember that time with the bathroom roof? Forget it, I don't want to get you mad. But I'm worried here. If you are not strong, they'll do whatever they want. The best thing is for me to go. I'll head out as soon as I'm available. Maybe tomorrow. Let me organize my agenda. Anyway, babe. I'm going into a meeting right now. Talk to you later. Love you. Honey, you don't need to come. I have everything under control. I do want to see you and be with you, but I can manage. It's all right. As for the bathroom, I'm not useless, okay? You didn't mean that, but the bathroom thing... it was an accident, an exception. I'm doing just fine with the workers. Hello. This is for you. - Thank you. - My small contribution. Cool. You're welcome. I'm going to the beach now. I'll be back in a while. I'm taking my phone with me. Call me if you need anything. - Okay. - Won't you stay and drink with us? - No, thanks, that's for you. - Sure? - Are you completely sure? - Totally. I'm completely sure. - Enjoy it. - She's pregnant already. Ma'am, how was the beach? The side of the barbecue is not well done. It looks messy. - You have to fix it. - Yeah. We'll fix it all right, don't worry. - We can do that later. - Later? It'll dry up by then. Do you smoke, ma'am? Yes. Then smoke one and forget about that stupid thing. We'll fix it up. Was the water nice? I had an emergency and I ran out of credit, we both did. So I used your phone. Ana called, she said she'll call you back. I was just telling him that the side of the barbecue looks very messy. You should fix it before it dries up, all right? Yes. Later. We have to eat, right? Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. Wait. Why are you taking those? You can't take my things without my permission, I told you that. All right? You didn't say we couldn't listen to music. Here. - Excuse me. - Want some sausages? No. Hello, this is Weissman. Leave a message. Hi, Weissman. It's about the work you're doing. I'm Laura. I want to know when you're coming back. You haven't been here these last few days and you're the boss. I think things are getting a bit out of hand. You might need to give them some instructions. Somebody must tell these guys what to do. So, as I said, you should stop by and... and take a look. Please, call me back. Bye. Pick that up. Hello? Hello, Laura. How are you? You're on the seaside, right? Oh, it's you, Ana. Yes, how did you know? Andrés told me. Yes, I came here because we're finishing the BBQ area. We hope it's ready before the year ends. Yes, he told me that. Did you come here to write? Yes, but it's getting quite hard. I can't seem to concentrate. Do you think we can meet? I got your corrections. We can take a look at them. But if you are too busy, I can stop by. SORRY No, that's not a possibility. Oh, okay. Anything wrong? No, nothing is wrong. You know how it is when you have workers at home. Everything gets dusty or broken. It won't be possible. Yeah, I know what you mean. How about the beach stand? Sounds good. Let's talk later. Your kids are still going to Pellegrini School, right? Yes. It's a tough school, but they like it. They're happy with it. León even hosts a radio show there. - That's great. - Yes, he's very excited. Coco! Two more, please. Thanks. Yes. - How's Matias? - He's fat. Really? Thanks, Coco. I can't picture him. Thanks. Thank you. Well, after everything that happened. - Can we go on? - Yes, let's dive into it. No excuses now. - Courage. - And rectitude. Come with me. Yes, I like that! One more time, baby, one more time. Hold it. Here it comes! Wait, wait. The other one. - I want to bite it. - No! - This is for me. - Here, here. - Here? - Yes, here. What is this? Ma'am. What are you doing in my house? We are celebrating. Today we finished the project. "Weiman" is coming back tomorrow, we'll pick up everything and leave. You can celebrate outside, not inside my house. Go party outside. We didn't have anywhere else. It's more expensive at the girls' place. You're so cheap. Shut up, I brought you dessert. Look here. Don't be an ass. Come on! Get her out. Get her out of my house! Let's go, babe. Hey! No, not the car. Come on, Toto! It's a beautiful night. Hey! Where are you going? I'll go take a piss. Hello, this is Weissman. Leave a message. Weissman, this is a disaster. Your guys, your workers, got whores into my house, you hear me? Whores, in my house. So please come here and kick them out or I'm going to call the police. If you don't come, I'm calling the police, you hear? There's no toilet paper. Weissman said you called him, girl. Did he just call you? Why didn't he call me? And don't get familiar with me, you hear me? Stay in line. Look, I don't mess with your privacy. And you got familiar with me first. You have no idea about social standings, do you? You have no idea about... What did Weissman say, anyway? His truck broke down. He's not coming because it's late. - And... - He can go fuck himself. Bye. Scram! - Okay, get some rest. - You fucked up my doors. They were perfect before! Get out, and don't you block the door. I'm sick of you. You won't hear anything from up there. Scram. I don't want to see your face again. You won't even realize we're still here. - Will you open? - Go on. Go get some rest. Miriam says she'll get mad if you don't share it with her. Come on. That asshole finished the coke! Pick up, you son of a bitch. Pick the fuck up! Hello, this is Weissman. Leave a... Wait, wait. Wait, wait. You brought us everything. Check this out. Toto! - Toto, come here. - Here's daddy. The booze is here. Check it out. - Give me some. - Hold on. Here you go. Morning, ma'am. Morning. We were about to wake you up. You missed all the party last night. You should have come down. Come take a look at the BBQ area. We have finished. Pretty, huh? - You're done with it? - Yes. I want you to go. Are you going to clean this up? - We don't have the truck. - Okay, buddy. What did he say? He said that... he's coming later to settle the price with Laura here. You mean you were talking with Weissman? He'll pick everything up and take it away, and he'll get one of us to do all the finishing touches. So you deal with him, I'm out of here. Bye, ma'am. See you. Goodbye. - Nice work, by the way. - Very nice. Nice and cheap like me. Wait up. Move your ass. That bitch is stingy. Hello, this is Weissman. Leave a message. Hi, I'd like to know if you're coming. You must come for your pay. So here's an update. Your workers left a complete mess behind. You have to clean it up. Bring cleaning help or something. And would you be so kind as to answer my calls? We need to talk. We need to coordinate this. You're calling Andrés Livingston. I'll call back as soon as I can. Hi, honey. My phone battery went dead. They have finally finished the BBQ. I dropped dead last night. So I couldn't check your messages until I charged my phone. Why did you phone? Are you coming? Is that it? Let me know and I'll go buy us some fish. How are the kids? Ask them to call me or text me. The BBQ looks good, but... but it's a mess, so I'm waiting for them to clean it up. Anyway. .. Let me know if you're coming. Let me know. Love you. Hi, Laura. I'll be in the BBQ area. - Hi. - The barbecue looks good to me. It looks great. Shall we settle the balance? It's so embarrassing. Fucking a guy like you. An insignificant thing like you. Because you're clearly insignificant. Barely more than a builder. You're trash, so tacky. Laura, it's not easy for me to discuss money with you. I stumble over my words. Perhaps I come on a bit strong. I won't charge you for the gas, the tolls and all those little things. I couldn't do that to you. - It's so embarrassing. - Come again? - I'm telling you it's embarrassing. - Hey, stop! What got into you? - Are you crazy? - I'm kidding. You're crazy! I was just kidding. You freaked out. You're such a pussy. - Pick up, it's your phone. - It's not urgent. - Come on. - It's not urgent, really. Pick up that damn phone of yours. You never pick up. Hello. I'm in the BBQ, cleaning up. I'll settle the price and call you back or go back directly. Bye. - Your wife? - My girlfriend. Why didn't you say you were living with your girlfriend? It had nothing to do with it. What do you mean? Laura, do you think a guy like me can be alone? Well... I was joking. Laura, relax. It was obvious. No, it was not obvious. You slept in my house. We workers always do that. If it gets too late to come back, we stay. - Always? - No, not always. Usually, when the owners are not around. - This wasn't the case. - It clearly wasn't. - Because I was here. - How about you? How about me? Don't you have a husband, kids and stuff? Yes, I never hid that. Shall we settle the pay? I already did with the workers. - Are you kidding me? - No. Look, I don't know what you agreed with them. You shouldn't have talked to them in the first place. All I know is that we had a deal and we must stick to it. Well, then let me inform you. I already paid them. I paid for their party, their whores, their drugs, their trip back home. - Everything. - Come on, that's not fair, Laura. Look at the house you have. Look at your BBQ. Don't be ungrateful and stingy. A bit more money is nothing to you. You should be generous. Let go. It's hard, but it'll do you good. Really. Let's settle the price and I'll get out of here. What are you now? A life guru? Giving me advice? I have this house because I earned it. And I'm not satisfied with this. What is this? Stop. Don't hit it. This is coming apart. What the hell did they do here? Is this a sculpture or what? Why is this falling off? - That's not concrete. - What do you mean? No. It looks like concrete, but it's earth and straw. - It's called adobe. - It's garbage. It's sustainable. - Sustainable, right. - Yes. In this area, we make an effort to do things the natural way. Like with the composter and the building materials. - Okay? - Right. Here. Look. - This is our letter of consent. - Right. I have to submit this to my supervisors. It's all detailed in here. There's no trick. All right? All right. You know what you need here? An orchard. I could build it for you. You could grow herbs in it. TASKS PERFORMED: BUILDING OF BBQ WITH CEMENT BOARD CONCRETE FINISH ON THE INSIDE, FLOORING INSTALLATION AND SMOOTHING. It wasn't me. - How about a toast? - Sure. There's enough for both. What are we toasting to? To finishing the job? To the beautiful BBQ you've built. Nah. Let's toast to our friendship, to us. Let's make it more romantic. To our friendship. Laura! Laura! Take it off! - Anything else? - That'll be all for now. Thank you. PLANT NURSERY Will anyone help you unload this back there? - Yes. - Or I could... That's fine. I have someone at home who will help me unload it. - Are you sure? - Yes, thank you. Lau? Have you seen "Weiman"? We've searched for him everywhere, but no luck. - Maybe you're keeping him here. - Who is it that you're looking for? "Weiman." Weissman! Weissman! That's how you pronounce it. Don't get worked up. I'm just looking for my boss. We can have a friendly chat. - I don't chat with workers. - You don't? Well, that's news to me. How about your dear husband? Does he chat with workers? I'd like to tell him what happened in your house these last few days. So you are going to tell him? Go on. Let's see if he can understand you. No one understands your cheap accent. What are you going to tell him, huh? That you got whores into my house and fucked them in here? Don't get jealous. I can't fuck a whore, but you can fuck my boss? Of course I can. This is my house. If I want to fuck your boss in my bed, I'll do it. It's not your house, it's my house. Who knows where you live. A phone is ringing? Is it yours? It's not mine. It's Weiman's phone. That's his ringtone. So what? Do you expect us to look for it in the dark? No way. Go back and if you see Weissman, tell him to come for it on Monday. Anything else? No. Thanks. Bye. You're changed, honey. Looks like taking care of the BBQ did you good. I'm proud of you. HIGH TIDE
