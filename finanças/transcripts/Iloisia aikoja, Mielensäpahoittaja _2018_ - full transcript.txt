Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun Once there were valleys where rivers used to run Once there were was blue sky with white clouds high above Once they were part of an everlasting love We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields Life is a fine journey. Shall I call you a taxi? I came in the Escort, I'll leave in the Escort. Call the police if you feel like it. HAPPIER TIMES, GRUMP Directed by Tiina Lymi Kolehmainen! These sure will last you 'til July. Go ahead, eat. Boil in the evening, fry in the morn. But why? Why won't you eat them? I intend to die. Everything is clear... My love. Ford? No GPS? I reserved a fully equipped... Nice to be in Finland. Don't you know your way home? Belgium is home. It's a matter of principle for dad. What now then? A paper map? Stupid country. Dad, go and check the gate for mother's plane. Thanks, we'll take the car. There are no boards here! 39.80. In Brussels it'd get you oysters and a bottle of wine. No. What now? Mother's plane is 90 minutes late. Of course it is. Small wonder. Think about it: Helsinki Vantaa. In a crap country. Your airport is now JFK. When will Grandma's funeral service begin? At two. You got 90 minutes to study. Woohoo! That's an interesting point. That one, underline it. Immaterial rights. A good thing for you to master. You might question them. Hi! Darling. How are you? A godawful country. When I reserve a car with GPS I expect to get one with GPS. That's stressing you most? Sofia darling! Mother. We haven't seen for so long. I've been travelling so much. Oh? Ladies! Let's go. Missed you so much. Quick action now. A change of clothes, a small salad, coffee, what have you. Liverwurst! Jesus Christ! Finnish gourmet food. Pants are liverwursthued. Faces are liverwurstcoloured. But it's the same as paté. Liverwurst and paté, the same thing? Sofia understands. She's not liverwurst people. We are paté people. Butter eye buns! Wonderful. Don't use your hands. Can't I just get a summer job at the ABC? You can only get these in Finland. Can't see Sofia baking frozen ABC buns. Honey. Next time you deal with that dump you'll redesign their concept, change operational management, and charge them 70,000 plus VAT for it. Right, Katri? Give me a bun, too. Sofia and the grated food buffet. Roll it. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. And the idea of continuity touched me right by this source of Mother's spiritual heritage. It's like this: The Church is essential as an institution. Especially at these breaking points of human life. Yes. Hertta was a fine labourer and a mother. Hers was the life of a smallholder where life and death went hand in hand. Mother was quite firmly a woman of her era. Emancipation never quite reached Father's yard. I see. Scorn. Pekka didn't mean that, Father. Pekka meant exactly that. Here goes. Sure had a tractor in the yard. And I bought a Siemens. For her 60th birthday. A dishwasher. Right. No, Father. Women don't have to crawl in potato fields any more, or milk the cows at five. Sauna's not the only high point of the week. I miss Mother. Sofia. Princeton, really? That's fabulous. They don't take too many people. Guess how many applied? 18,000. Guess how many got in? A hundred. How many of the Princeton alumni have got the Nobel Prize? Eight. Famous Princeton graduates: Obama. Wilson. Fitzgerald. Our Sofia. Steve Forbes. The list goes on. Ahtisaari got one although he'd let himself go fat. So the girl should get a Noble. That's hard work. Nice of you to be concerned. You've been so interested. Did you have to? What did I do? This is how they talk in Finland. Just let it go, honey. It is customary to say something. I said to the Missus before... Before she died. So many things you can't get back. Like a back with no pain, longdistance running success and a life together. And the circular saw Kolehmainen borrowed. Return it. You'll get your saw. Tomorrow, if you want. I return to my speech. It sure ruined my day when sorrow moved in. You remember things. The Missus insisted on a wedding waltz. I sure don't dance. I had to. Or our union will be a short one, she said. My son Hessu. And Pekka. For a time you learned the ways of man in my house. You left. The walls grew quiet. The Missus went to the kitchen to do the dishes. To cry. I turned up the volume on the TV. The Missus wanted us to talk together. I was happy to be silent together. That's it. At my funeral, coffee and mineral water will be enough. I'll make the coffin myself. That's the speech. There are the cakes. Reminisce. I will go and die. Insufferable man. He's really making a coffin. He's got frontal lobe dementia. I miss Mother. There has to be a disposal site for someone like him. You're being so wonderfully sensitive, darling. Salut. What did I do now? Emotions are like this in Finland. Right, Father. We're going. Goodbye. Father. Killing yourself will be very traumatic for us. If you put a bullet in your head or play the human yo-yo we'll be guilty of negligence when we now leave. Sure ain't a selfkiller. A messy affair. How did you plan to die? In the sauna. Our family dies in the sauna. You take your anti-hypertensives? I got pump meters in the house. Checked myself. Fine figures, high ones. Want to know what you got? Frontal lobe dementia. Really great. Hessu, for real. How about October 17th? A good day to kick the bucket? Shall I mark it down? Do that. There. Father dies, location: his sauna. Thanks for a swell party, so nice to meet again. It's his decision... Father, I'll call you on the weekend. I won't! Pekka. Did you have to? On Mother's funeral day. Washing machine in the yard. I'll find a disposal site for him. A nursing home, you mean. This went really fine again for a change. Hertta. Let's talk about this. Sure hasn't been an easy day. Sixty years together with the Missus. It's hard to see where to step. Sure ain't grief water in my eye. You mean what? Helsinki Business Forum. A very important event. Avoid these: drunks, con men, Finns. You'll just catch the diabetes and gap year gabbing. Network with the Yanks. They're irritating but you'll get used to them fast. Oh Sofia. The most important years of your life. Look at me. I just want you to have a totally different start than I did. Here's a debit card for you. Use it wisely. Thanks. Honey. Hug. Let's message. Let's go, darling. We have to take are of the old man's disposal site. And the meetings, and all that. Bye. Bye. Intercity train 50 from Tampere to Helsinki will arrive on platform two. The attic room, 17.4.1954. My love. You said you don't use words like those. What you reading? What? You sure mustn't scare people. Grandpa darling. Wonderful to see you again. Never use big words lightly. You can have feelings when you know someone. We don't. I'm staying here. You sure aren't! Someone must take care of you. Listen! Always taken care of myself. But you need help. I can sleep upstairs. Girl! Just great! Is the sauna on? Sweet! Women's round! Boyakah! I remember that bucket, and the beating branches. So cool! A pail and a birchswitch. And you can move on, girl. I'll be dead in two months. This is no inn. But I'm here now. I've really missed you. Thanks, Grandpa. You sleep in your bed or in your coffin? For one night only! Hear me, girl? One night. Yes. Depression or dementia, my husband wonders. Frontal lobe dementia. Your prices are pretty upscale. What are, where? Nothing. Guess you must pay for peace of mind. We feel uncertain. Not knowing the situation. 16 square metres, was it? Yes. Decorate it ourselves? Yes. Rather comfortable. Think about it, we'll do the papers later. Fill in his lifeline form at leisure. Pekka. Honey, let's go to Aulanko. This is too depressing. We'll have our sex holiday, whatever happens. Holiday, I mean. Vanilla holiday. I learned to swim here. I was about five. Grandma and I went to a pond. There was a high cliff. I could really pig out on this stuff. What is it? Pork. In brown sauce, boiled potatoes. Imagine dad serving this at a diplomatic dinner. Oui, Monsieur l'Ambassador. Cette sauce bruné avec pommes de terres. You've lost thousands at the poker table? What? You need money? I don't need money. I need peace. Won't you finish that? Totally gruesome grub. Kolehmainen! Kolehmainen! Simmer down, man. You'll get your saw. It's pregnant. The saw? The girl. Arrived without asking. I realized everything. Seen the same signs. In my wife, and several cows. Take the chairs. Yes. You have to protect them. The pregnant ones. We tend to do that, right? Pretty good habit, I think. Sure don't have enough potatoes. I kept a couple of buckets only. May have to take some back from you. Yes. Brings potatoes, takes them back. Unmanly. Forgot to keep my eyes on the ball again. Should've kept my eyes on the ball. Why don't I remember that? No answer. She didn't answer last night either. Of course not. Helsinki nightlife until the small hours with the international crowd. Helsinki Business Forum. Exactly right seedbed for our girl. Yeah. No worries. We won't worry a bit. I've so waited for this vacation. Let's not spoil good sex with worries. Are we being awful, running away together like this? Nah. A basic need. Eyes on the ball. On the ball. I'll call Sofia after this hole. Pretty sweet. Things are as slack here as 30 years ago. Read the Duck, play rattle music with the sun high in the sky. Was this dad's room when he left home at sixteen? A proper yeah yeah mullet. You got something to say to me? Got a groom? What? From the Data Net, perhaps. Life on proper course? Got your eye on a plot for your house? When you study business life you don't sign bank drafts. Surely not. Okay? Do I have a guy? No. Why are you interested? A house? I really won't take out a loan in this market situation. Yes, exactly, I knew it. One needs an escort. Can we go to the shop? Let's go to the shop. Is that Grandma's curler? Is that Grandma's hair? Helps me remember what her hair felt like. I think lower and remember the feel of her hip under my hand. A curler sure is better than a thousand fingerfone pictures. Now everything! These are good! Shall we have olives? Yes. Oat drink. Yes. A traumatic situation. Death of the spouse. Inner void. You think opulence can fill it, but as a doctor... I eat potatoes. Sofia is hungry. A growing young lady. A marathonist? Endurance sport, I guess. Yes. Life. Thanks for everything, Kiminkinen. For nothing, that is. Stop for a moment. The Escort's outside. Who drove it there? You have no licence. I took it away personally. And I took it personally. From a competent man in the prime of his life. But you just can't without... It's a crime, a serious matter. I must call the police. Grandpa didn't drive, I did. Right, Grandpa? You got a licence? Sure. Got it in Belgium at 16. I drive a lot really. You have to be of age here. How old are you? I was born in 2000, do the math. I really drive a lot. You should see the Belgian roundabouts. Here: trees, trees, cow, barn. Child's play. Let's go. In principle, I didn't even lie. I was born in 2000. But in November. Want your frozen foods put in a polybag? Where? 248.71. Nothing sure won't cost more than 200 euros. I'll pay. Thanks. You got an SCard? In the parking lot. I come here every week. Every time you ask about my Escort. Every time I answer: in the parking lot. For goodness sake! Let's go, Grandpa. Please, Sofia. A gentleman always opens the door for a woman. I've never driven a car. Happier times! We'll have to turn the engine on. No. There's the keys. Ignition on the left. And turn. The clutch! What? We won't panic. Clutch by the left foot, brake in the middle, gas pedal on the right. Press the clutch down. Press it. I'll be the sticksman. Start the engine. There. Very good. Slide the clutch, carefully press the gas. And slowly we go. Gas, gas, gas. Good, good. Nice and easy. Drive there, turn right. Carefully, like this. Right! Turn right! Doing good. Now straight ahead. Good, good, good. Turn around that corner, we'll change the driver. No we won't. Kiminkinen's sniffing our rear. Don't you care about it, girl. He's going the same way until Puropaju crossing. I've seen easier games, like in Lahti 2001. Help! Now we pump. What? We have to jump from first gear straight to third. What? Why? Don't ask. Press the clutch. That's it. Now we just go. High five, Grandpa, high five! Don't leave me hanging! G'day. Highway handshakes? Like surely not. Yes! I drove a car! You're the best! Thanks ever so much. You're the best teacher. Where do your parents think you are? I'll take the shopping. Answer me. In Helsinki. I said I'm going to Helsinki Business Forum and network there like hell. Hand out business cards. Cause if you don't network and suck up to the world you waste your life. So excuse me, I can leave. Excuse me for existing and I'm sorry I was born. I'll take the shopping in now. Put the bags down! You won't carry them. You're carrying something else. You're expecting. Like whom? We won't know that until it is born. You're expecting the child of a man. Shall we cook the noodles? Still no answer. Don't be hysterical. I'm not hysterical. She's got to study every day, and internalize. She must stand out at once in Princeton. Ruins her life, drinking with Finns. The end of many lives. How I hate Finland. Sauna peace. Sauna peace. Graduates in two years, Princeton at first try. Super girl, always been. It's none of my business but do you give her space to grow? If you don't, she'll take it herself. Had the same experience. I suffocated our Seija. Nothing good came out of it. Yes, she became an alcoholic. Why tell everybody? It's not easy for anyone. I remind you of the sauna peace. A young person is an uncast die. Exactly. An uncast die. Bon appétit. I sure don't eat shoestrings. Ahem. Sohvi. The first one's always the best. Now they want to change when they see rust on a car, or a wrinkle in the marriage. Even women among themselves. You got different ransrostrites and colour curve people. Nothing to it, men with men. None of my business. Unless the new life sits in my kitchen. Right. It went like this. We were in Rue Du Cart. Me, André, Juliette, Bol, Marcel and Gita. My classmates. In a bar called La Mirano, a cocktail workshop. A wonderful place, mix your own drinks with the bartender. Ice cream, vodka, basil, that sort of fusion. Some guys came in. I had a gorgeous dress, just plain superb. An immediate fling with the dark one. We went to the dance floor... And that was just the first round! When I woke up he was gone. Haven't seen the guy since. I don't even know his name. I was a bit drunk, stupid and childish. And now I've ruined everything. Yes, for sure not. I didn't even know I was pregnant until I was twelve weeks gone. My period's always been irregular. I thought it's just the stress. I was studying for the entrance exams. I'm at my best under pressure, father always says so. It sure ruined my day when they said on the radio gymnastics help with back pain at any age. Sure don't. What's that got to do with this? You need a strong back to give birth, the young have gone slack and... You must tell your mother. And your father too, I guess. What do think my father will say? Right. Hi dad. What now? I'm here... At Helsinki Business Forum. The Slush pop up. An innovation thinktank. Really fine contacts. Opposite me is a hightech investor from South Korea, Pao Wong Bruce Lee Papa Vong. Really well but we're a bit busy. Papa Vong promised to arrange a gettogether for young talents. How about you there? Just work, just work. Thinking about grandfather's future. Your mom just sends you some money. So you can survive in this unreasonably expensive country where a frigging vacuumpacked wet rye roll costs 4.80. By the way, in Brussels you get... All right darling, can it. Okay, must stop now. Kiss kiss, bunny. Listen: "Life cycle form". "What would bring pleasure or please the patient?" "I don't dance, sing, celebrate". His annual birthday announcement. You're not going write down that? Of course, I'm writing the truth. "Most important characteristics". Should I write "Frigging sly company". "Important relationships with friends". He has no friends! He can't stand anyone born postwar. I won't be present when you put that document in. Wife! Watch and rejoice. I'm going to swim now. Where's Prisma in Tiiriö? Sofia has used the card there. You sure don't disturb the order. Real fine, your coffin is. I had a good death waiting. Now they want comments and reactionaries. Raising your own kids should be enough. Now I've got their kid here, and the next one. Vodka mixed with ice cream. Loving strangers. Don't know how to stay quiet about important things. Hallo. It's me. Pekka? Right. Is the girl here? Why would a girl of the world come to deepest Finland? Why give credit cards to the young? You manage with cash. Should've raised the girl properly. Excuse... You lack a dialogical connection with her. What do you runt blather? Electric messages only on Data Net. Maybe that made her grow crooked? How do you dummy dare... I sure listen to yelling from javelin throwers only and you were never up to it. Goodbye. Hallo! Goddammit! Thank you, Grandpa! I sure have never lied before. Goddammit! Or cursed. Now that's done, too. Are you badly hurt? You in trouble? Kolehmainen, mind your own business, thanks. Did her water go? What? Does he know, too? Did you do Insta and Snap too? I don't know them. I needed Kolehmainen. Grandpa. My father, my mother, none of my friends know. Instead, you and some old man next door... Kolehmainen! He's got some super hearing? They wondered about it in the Army, too. But now: go to sleep! Everything's clearer in the morning. Kolehmainen is right. You'll stay for another night. In the morning we'll drink coffee and be silent. Do things together. You have dirty laundry? What? It's a chore for the Missuses. But as the machine is outside it's an outdoor job and a task for men. Dialogical connection. He might consider his own dialogical connection to me. Frigging gimp! First of all. There's some perfectly logical explanation to the card. Dialogical connection. Fuck! Listen now. Close your eyes. Is that where she is? She's with that codger! Lies to me! Why isn't she at the Business Forum? Can you really imagine our Sofia eating potatoes in brown sauce? Our Sofia in the outhouse? Drinking sour milk? Or kvass? There. Hammering nails into the coffin. No! Imagine this. Liverwurst in one hand, the other milks a cow. No more, really! Excuse me. The others need to eat in peace. No, it's like this. Remember sauna peace. Dinner peace. Yes, will do. She's probably lost the card, someone else has used it. We'll cancel it, call her tomorrow. Sofia eating sour milk with mixed flours. Thank you for the wine. Watching the Kaleva Games. There. Missuses' feet are cold. I hope the Pöntiö town hall will be finished soon and I will get you back. I hope you can borrow a pair of woolen socks, you forgot them here. Under the bed. I miss you. You said you can't use that word either. But come and stop me. I miss you. Your mother speaks about our wedding. I have thought about it, too. I wait, tense. The wedding waltz. You shall dance, my old man. Mr You Yourself. Do you know how long we've been silent now? I know. Twentynine days. If you say nothing I remain silent, too. And what for? I turned up the radiator. We have children in the house. My hands are full, so are yours. Radiators are for not having to warm the house with firewood. It sure ruined your day not to be able to dig your own grave. Hertta? Should we remain silent for a whole month? That sure ruined your day. Me myself, and my sour mood. Grump, grump. God's guns and wooden bullets! Are you laughing at me? What's that racket? The third step is slippery. Be careful. Okay. How nice. Bleat it! Shut up! The Missus'... Girl! Girl! Go up and get your ass kicked Pekka is a CKIRP Hi! We've tried to call you. What's up, Ckirp? What? Guess where I am? At Signam Butnam's lecture. Just checked your schedule. Immaterial rights. Yeah, really creative feeling here at primary production. We've been a bit worried. I can see so far from here. You must have visions. But have you been studying or partying? Yes. Which one? Course I haven't studied, I've been partying. Hallo! I'm deep in the woods. I'm pregnant. Tee hee, Sofia. Tee hee, father. Is everything really ok? Everything's always ok. I'm so good, you know that. Right. We cancelled your card, thought it was lost or stolen. For a moment we even thought... Shit, it made me laugh again. Give the phone to mother. Flour mix. Right. Kiss, kiss. Katri. It's Sofia. Darling! Hi! Well? I just called to ask. Can we make brown sauce sometime? What? And mother. Well? I love you. Wonderful. Sofia. Darling? Hallo? Grandpa! Slacking off though sun's high in the sky. Been reading the Duck? Grandpaleisson, losing your grip? Leisson? Why here? Aren't you busy building your coffin? It won't be ready when you kick the bucket. That sure is no safe place. Did father really build this? Pekka didn't listen to me. Wanted to build it himself of timberwaste. I said he could, if it will turn out fine. Wasn't fine, it was bad. I told him. He got mad, didn't want to learn. You said that to a ten year old? I was teaching him. Come on, this is fine. Lasted all these years. I told you it's unsafe! Did you have to go there? Did you have to climb up? Pregnant, for goodness sake! You hurt yourself? No. And you have no permission to use the Missus' cup. You use them, you return them to the cupboard, clean. Fuck, I'm sorry. Things must have their place. You have a place for me, too? You want me to leave? Pregnant women don't climb. I couldn't know that Grandma's cup shouldn't be used! Hear me? Really impolite not to answer. What's the matter? You're not with me. I am, I am. What's on your mind? Love. Right. No. Sofia said she loves us. That's just great. Well yes. But she never says it. We don't talk like that. Well I do, but you don't. Have I done something again? Can we discuss this when... No. We're going there. Where? Right in the middle of a great copulation? Something's wrong. Call Hessu. He gets along with the old man. Tell him to start driving right now. You said everything's all right. Couldn't we just a bit... Pekka, the maternal instinct. Start dialling. You love me, right? You're frightened! Big words for a small girl. You like me, and you're afraid. Difficult emotions arrive just when you should die. What did you plan to die of? Got cancer? See that tree? My father planted it when I was born. Its roots are dying, it has to be felled. That's just the way it goes. Don't need a disease to sap your strength. The Missus is gone. No reason to remain here. You liked Grandma like a hog. Pork I like, yes. Right, don't admit a thing. Why build a coffin if nothing matters? Why not just lie down in a hole? I asked the Building Board to let me burn myself in the yard. No permission, hygiene rules. Strange that they didn't go along. I'll rather die like this than lie drooling in bed for years. Like Grandma? Don't talk about Grandma like that. Why not? She turned into a vegetable like everyone else. You wished she'd die away. Who gave you that idea? Your father? Blasphemy. This visit is over now. If you wanted to ruin my day, you did it. Apple jam 2015 Grandpa, forgive me. Bus timetable is in the wall apron. Okay. I'll get my things. Won't you answer it? Are the timetables here? Is it kicking? When is it due? I dunno. There's still time... I'm not sure. For goodness sake. What did the guidance people say? At the Belgian centre? You've gone there? You haven't. You fall out of tree huts, don't go to guidance centres. We're going. Kop khun kha! Kop khun kha! What did you yell? Kop khun kha. It's "hi" in their tongue. Whose? My friends in the forest. Small people, quite tiny. Okay. Concentrate on driving. Hunger makes you angry. Food in mouth, squealing stops. You're Sofia? Come in. I sure will not. Seventeen years. You're underage. And live in Belgium. And the father. Is he... Does he live in Finland, Belgium, or... The girl fell from a tree, her father did a poor job. Check that everything's all right. But you're not the father? I am. Grandpa! Father of two sons. Hessu and Pekka. Grandpa for her. Right. About the father, there's... No. The man mixing ice cream and vodka. Excuse me? The girl will explain. I see. So. She and some foreign Teddy boys went to a local saloon. Don't recall the names. Mitterrant, or Jack Sirak. Then taxi, elevator, hotel room. Now we're in a guidance centre in the darkest Finland. Right. Mitterrant hasn't been seen since. There's no sense of responsibility. Teddy boys can hardly shoulder their own hair. Right. "Father unknown". I just told you that! Last period? I don't know. Parents, major diseases? Father is a major idiot. I agree. Risky constructions. "Father is a major idiot". Prepregnancy health habits: Alcohol, tobacco, drugs? I don't even smoke grass. Nor should you. Unless you master it to perfection. I learned burnclearing from my father. I'll apply some gel on your belly. It's a bit cold. Any fears concerning pregnancy? No. Like to tell me about the fears you don't have? No. I don't know. I'm going to USA to study. When? In three months' time. You'll be almost due by then. Grandpa! There's the head. Heart. Ten fingers, ten toes. Everything's all right. Here's a photo of the little one. This is the sixth month. That's a person there. Nine months in the belly. Connected with a string. You should sit down for a moment. I'm okay. The door. Thanks, bye! A tough thing at her age. And at mine. Girl! I'm no Usain any longer. Girl! Stop now! I'm going to the bus stop! Then I leave. Goodbye, Grandpa. Sofia! Are you there? Country folk hide their key somewhere nearby, right? Not under the rock, woodpile, shed. Looking for the key? You were supposed to come earlier. I visited Mother's grave. Besides, the door isn't locked. Just lift it a bit. To Mother's grave? The only one who knew how to get in? You'd known if you had visited. I remind you of brotherly peace. Yes, Hessu. Yes, Pekka. See if the girl's here. Look for signs. Don't boss us around. Nothing would work if I didn't. Goes to Mother's grave. You were to come straight here. Right. Look. What do you say about this? It's your face. What? No, no. I made a video of you. Selfie mode was on, because of Tinder. Now I don't understand. Don't confuse things. You were driving the Tinder. Escort, I mean. Listen, Kiminkinen. I need a doctor's appointment. I'll come at three today. No, I'm on holiday. I'll be there at three. All right, thanks. I'm sorry. So you're quite sure my daughter Sofia is not here? I would notice any extra girls. There was one in '56. Your mother. Thank you for all this information. Tell us if you hear anything. Thanks. You'll get the word. That's the way people are in Finland. Gotta poo. I heard that. Grandma never drooled. I was mean. Shouldn't be. Everything's so confusing. You were almost right. I didn't want Missus to die. But I did want her to be released. We'll go and visit her. Wife! Yes? We'll make some coffee. Father keeps it in the cupboard. Just some filter crap. Sofia was in my lap right away. And you never let anyone touch her. She fitted my lap so well. Did we ever... Sit in Father's lap? I feel pity for the families where kids have to lie. But we have a special bond. I know her so well. The boys found sweet buns! We found each other. Kcirp, don't get emotional. She must be in Helsinki. What? How come? I think my maternal instinct failed this time. No. We'll go to the village. I'll take some flowers to Mother's grave. Hessu has been here. How do you know? He always brought yellow tulips to his mother. On Mother's Day. And other times, too. He's driven 200 kilometres again to bring yellow tulips. Never called me. My father wouldn't drive. How do you know he won't come to look for you? He won't. I know how to steer them. I'm a super liar. Your Grandma always said: "You play hide and seek to be found". Let's go. For 23 years she told me to change. I guess I didn't change. Cough once. Carted off... Again... the Iittala glassware on a hand truck. This is it now, a single life. I'm on Tinder. How does the pump sound? Pumps strong and even. Anything else? Marketta got really serious. Got herself a lawyer, partitioned the property... My bodily functions. Will I live a couple of years yet? Looks good, but your blood pressure's a bit high. Prescribe me liniments. Camphor drops and Aspirin. But you don't take medicine. I do now. Yep. Grandpa. If I have a baby... When I have the baby. What do I do if it wants to play basket ball or Frisbee... What do I do? Everything will work out fine. Let's go. Pekka! Don't say a thing. Father touched another person. We'll stay here for the night. You, too. You're the balancing element. Not in the café. Seen anything? No one here. We'll stay the night here. We'll take a room at a motel or something. Hessu! A motel? Are there any left? Was the hair naturally curly, or done with those curlers? Curlers? I don't think so. How did the pregnancies go? Arvi's pregnancies? For God's sake, Grandpa! Grandma's pregnancies! I'm not talking about some Arvi. Right. Small tummy turns into a big belly. You get tweaks. Then you make a crib. Then they want to put their father into a care home. Was Grandma ill? How long did she do work? Back pains, morning sickness? Milked the cows in the morning, skied in to give birth. Skied? Didn't want to give birth in the sauna. You got faster to the Central Hospital on skis. What did you then do? Upstairs. We needed space. There. Thanks. I remember what it felt like to stand there. And jam. Wieners in Thai sauce. Häme Hereford pie. Spring roll à la Juvonen. I promised you a glamour & sex holiday and here we are. Please forgive me, wife. Some folks live here voluntarily. Pekka. You haven't changed. Thanks. And you are? Harri Tiainen. Howdy. Hi. Katri. Harri. And I live here voluntarily. Unemployed? Pekka. What? What did I do this time? One of the best sides in being Finnish. Don't have to be so PC all the time. Exactly. Welcome around. Staying for a longer time? Not voluntarily. We live in Brussels. I lived there for a while, too. Moved back here. Excuse me? This place is fun. Hi, Harri! Your chilli Karelian hot pot with fresh coriander and lemon grass. Great. Thanks, Tumppi. Thanks, Harri. See you! Hope you enjoy it here. Bye! There's a nice guy. And handsome. Yep. Harri Tiainen. Perhaps. But he didn't jump off Jyrkkäkallio cliff. Unlike me. Should I have the same? Chilli coriander. What is it? I'm not eating this muck. Where then? This is okay. It's great. A proper fusion kitchen. I'm going to the ABC. Sausage and chips, six euros. And they have butter eye buns. Pekka! For real! Pekka! Accordion has the best rhythm. Come and dance! Tell your father to come and dance. I don't dance. I don't sing. I don't celebrate. Show your moves! I know this song! There's a totally fab version of it. Oh gosh! Wait, wait! Where is it? I've got it here. There! The love of youth is... What've loosepant Teddy boys done to Vera Telenius? Is this legal? Let's worry about her immaterial rights later. Don't be so stiff! And we go! Flap your arms! Come on! Dance! Dance! Dance! And sing! The scent, scent, scent... Million million million roses What you doing? I'm going jogging. A longer run. Mother. I didn't hear your car. Morning. Morning. Make some coffee? Why not. You set it for just two. This is not a table for three. Remember why you play hide and seek. Sit down. If you need me, shout. Don't shout at each other. Should I buy them Crocs? This is a shitty fair. She stood me up. Really didn't show up. Strange. A doctor's not good enough. Tinder is just crap. Women crap. World's gone real weird. Are these genuine? Your father came to see me. Father saw a doctor? Yes, and that's nothing yet. Your face. Yes. But you can hear the Escort. Your father drove it, no licence. Had your daughter with him. Pretty bold going. Hessu! Let's go! You're going to keep it? And you believe you can take care of it? I believe. And I can. In that case I'll help you as much as I can. Everything's going to be alright. Right. This turns into a larger session. So you've been hiding her! In the car, now! Father goes into a care home, the girl to America. Let's ease off right away. Nothing's wrong. Sofia! Isn't it nice, we found her? Completely safe, in one piece. Except I'm not going to Princeton. Let me handle this. What's this nonsense? You messed with her head? And why is she here? Pekka. The thing is... I'm pregnant. What happened? I had sex. With whom? Who is it? Who knows? Why am I kept in the dark? Do you know? I closed my ears. But understood enough about the Mitteraats and Jack Siraks that we're not expecting totally ethnic Finnish genomes. Right. Abort it. Pekka! Straight to a health centre, we'll take care of it. You're going to Princeton! She's six months gone. You can't get an abort this late. I've seen the picture. Ten fingers, ten toes, and a heart. No one will ever know. Come here, my daughter! Hands off me! She's my daughter! She's mine, too. To be precise, neither of you own her. She's an underage child. Listen. Of all the people in the world, you stay out of this. Never thought I'd have to educate you again. Pekka! Stop ranting! This is exactly why I left. No one can stand a person who's always absolutely right. "I speak seldom, but to the point". "It sure ruined my day again". What are you talking about? About an atmosphere of fear. It is true, Pekka. No, around you! Yes. And around you, too. All your endless mutterings about something being right or wrong... Which one are you talking to? Both of you! Please stay out of this, this is a family matter. Don't talk to my woman like that. I apologise. I'm sorry you have turned into me. Hessu is right. Father apologised. So what? Who cares? I ask you. For Sofia's sake. Behave sensibly. I always behave sensibly! I'm the only sensible one here, you're the insensibles! This is the Finland I hate. You won't strangle my girl, force her to ski! She has no sticksman! Sofia! Father! Where're... It's my fault. We'll cut through here. Don't run, Father! Don't run! Your heart! Sofia! Grandpa! You all right, Father? Mother! Sofia! I'll get the car. Get the girl in the car! Take her to the road. I'll drive the car there. What is it, Sofia? Father, will you manage? I'll take Sofia to hospital, come back to check on you. Pekka! Why did you park here? It's a ditch! Open the doors! All doors! Hey! Are you alive? Neighbour. You wait there. I'll call an ambulance. I'd drive myself, but I've had a few. Seven. Cripes! The Mediheli is quick. Somewhere there. You shouldn't talk. Nothing to worry about. Everything will work out. We have to go now. Nothing to worry about. Can I see my daughter? We can't go there. Something really small and fragile is coming. You have a concussion and a contusion. Speak Finnish. Where did my Chinese friends go? Tell me what day is, or who's the President? You think I'm a total fool? Ahtisaari, of course. No, it's the curlyhead, Jenni's husband. Rest now. I'll bring you some juice. A moment. Ståhlberg was the first... Quite. 19 to 25... Head on the pillow. I'll be back in a minute. Relander, Travelling Lasse. Ukko Pekka. When did they stick this into me? I am afraid. My love. Will you remember for me? What is this? Words slip in wrong places. You're not angry at me, are you? You're not my husband. You are old. I never danced the wedding waltz with you. I don't remember things. I am afraid. Or did I dance? You will remember for me, won't you? Things I have to remember. My love... I miss. Can't remember what I'm missing. What is this? Night is long. Once there were greenfields kissed by the sun Once there were valleys where rivers used to run Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above Once they were part of an everlasting love We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields Greenfields are gone now parched by the sun Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart Sofia! Father! Wait there! Lass! Grandpa. Blanket over the feet. It came now. Strange how they always come. And live. And go. She will live, won't she? I must get one of those breast pumps to get milk for her. Hi there. How are you, lass? You're tinier than a carrot. Doesn't matter a whit in this world. Not afraid to come to the other side of the glass, are you? I tell you: it will be worth it. I thought I'd advise you tough it out. To advertise some good sides in the world: Potatoes, accordion music, crosscountry skiing. Maybe only I think they are good. Perhaps you don't. You may discover some other best things in the world. But you have people around you, take your time. Just breathe in there in peace and quiet. Grow your lungs. One thing more. Your mother's a fine lass. You got lucky, little one. Hertta. Father! Let's go. I wonder how Sofia will take the lack of sleep. And Katri and me, as well. She'll be all right, don't know about you. Wonder how she'll sleep. How did I sleep when I was small? With your eyes closed. What was I like when I was small? You were small. Carried you on my shoulders. Always jumping about. Mother, mother, look! I'll jump into the well! Right. You drive the rest of the way. Father. Can we start from the beginning? We'll continue from where we are. Do well more than poorly. Normal is enough. Occasionally we may dance. You worried in vain whether I get along with your father. An old stubborn man who thinks everything used to be better, you can eat mouldy bread, and people born in late 1800s are the only ones who remember what life was when it still was hard enough. My love. I am babbling now. I have a more important thing to tell. We will have a child. Grandpaleisson! Hi! Did Hertta come to see Grandpa? Who's there? There's Grandpa. Not any further. Right. We're here. Yes. Okay. Nature. Good. Hertta! The Japonianese want these. Tastes bad, but it's expensive like blood pressure medication. If we had a girl person studying business in America she might have a bit of a startup here. Grandpa, what do you mean? Pine mushroom. Matsunakke mushroom. JFGI. Did you say just fucking Google it? I don't swear. Let's have some coffee. Grandpa gives Hertta some coffee. You won't. That's between Hertta and Grandpa. At least don't put sugar in it. Four lumps at least. Your mother thinks you'll die of this. No one will die for a long time yet! Though you came unbidden Though I never called you You came and changed everything I'm fumbling I joined you on this journey Along this road we go Although I don't know the direction Or will I find it at all By your side, close to you Caressing you under my wing Strongest with tender strength Because without you I get lost in the woods, in the fog Sure to run into rock face Fall down the cliff Without essentials I am I hide you in the safety of my heart Guard your steps And when the time comes I let you go But I never leave you alone Because you are mine As I am yours Without you waves swallow me Without you I drown I can scream in silence Not to disturb your sleep I can carry you to safety Never let evil touch you On your skin or in your heart I will build you a world From these fragile pieces These that I have These little and only ones These that are mine Subtitles by Mikko Lyytikäinen / Movision
