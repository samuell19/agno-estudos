Yeah. I'll change that for you. In direction to the camera. You guys wanted to come towards the camera? I wanted to stay where she is. Ok. Beautiful. Another magazine, quick. OK. Now the filter is in there, right? Yes. Hold on. I just want to warn you that the sun is getting brighter. So we'll get a little - But listen, you know, the thing is this way the sun is getting brighter. We're going to lose her because we were shooting back light so if, you know? You know, bear with me. Just kind of -. Tie up in the back. Cameras! Action! That she gets - she starts moving around it's impossible to follow her, you know, it's like following her with with a with a shotgun,. What, she has to go very straight? Well, yeah, except that the sun is getting too bright now. You know, the thing is we told her to move, to move straight and she keeps going all over the place and I can't follow the 600. OK, Don, thank you. Yeah, but listen, we're gonna break here. We'll, just to some hand held shots. Start the music. Cut! I'm sorry. Let's go back. It was my fault. It was my fault. We have to play the music every time. You have to play the music every time. You have to play the music every time! So do you like it? Of course we like it, I wrote it. But, you know... It really is important to get the move, the right move, across the meadow with the music. It looks much better because if we didn't have the music, then you'd be walking any which way you felt like, this way at least you have a move. You have the right mood to move you, ok? Von? Yes. You tell me that the DJ wrote the song? No her husband wrote the song. You get a release for the song from your husband? Oh, yeah. Yeah. It was cleared. In other words, you have a separate release for her as the model and from her husband? Oh yeah. It's all been taken care of. Okay, ready? Okay. Paul, are you ready? Okay. That's nice. Expose yourself. Okay. And I'm gonna roll. Roll music. Cut! Cut! Okay. Now, come on now. OK, standby music. Ok. Roll music. Rolling. Really great! OK, let's wrap here. We'll move to the falls, we'll do lunch there. All right. It's a wrap! 93 FM, your favorite station for sports. And now the commentary on the crucial day of this test between England and the West Indies. He may not be as quite as quick as Flores, but he can certainly deliver a ball swiftly enough... And here he is running in and out. That short of a length. The ball coming through at a reasonable height. Right above the waist. As the defense quickly recovers. Because like this tree is, is that you can call pure oaks. And saranacs four or five years, right? This root will grow down to form a trunk. In the next couple of years... You might think it's like four different trees. But it's just one tree that started it. Just from one sprout, one little root. It's strange. I would stand right on the root that supports these tree. Check this out. It's like a real locks. Locks, locks! Locks that grows, you know, like hair that grows and is matted. Hair that grows right down like that. You can't imagine me with locks? Locks, standing brave. This song called "Dread Knotty, Dread Knotty" This tree could freak you out! Look at me at the camera. OK. We need to reflector there. Ronnie, what's happening? Passing through, man. What are you doing here, man? Press focus, so you see her behind it, but it would be sort of covering her. So there would be the nude look but we won't see it. Cut! It's not very serious, you'll be alright. It's still a little knotty, right? I think what really caused this is being in the water so long. I'm just getting old! PJ, here is what is going to happen. When I say action, you take the bottle, very naturally you bring it towards you. You open the cap and pour it in your hand. And as you're pouring it, smile. But as natural as it's possible. With the label this way, always. Go in with your hand behind it so that the label will be that way. Like... That's it. We have to see the label, PJ. Now, just like that. Turn it over that way. OK. When you're gonna pour twist it over. OK? All right. OK, let's go. Let's go. Here we go. Rolling. He's all first position. Second position. OK. That's beautiful, great. Hold it there. Nice. Really relate to the product. The smell, you know, going through your fingers, everything very, very, almost erotic. You know, a big Miss America smile. You know. Want me to do more than I just did? I can't look at the bottle and, you know, love the bottle. It's just a bottle. I've been doing it naturally. Love. Just let's try it. All right. One more. Just give, you know, really relate to it. All right? You said you wanted nautral, I don't understand what you really want. I don't want to look foolish! Would you please talk to PJ and tell her to do whatever Frank wants her to do? Hello. Yes. Yes, it is. No. Hi. How are you? Fine. Yes. My office called you? Why? Yeah. We were out on the beach, we just got back. Oh, no, they're changing it? We shot the product today. All right, Tom is going to bring it? When is he coming? Yeah. Oh, well, that's not bad. I can have someone meet him. What's the, what's plate number? And it gets? Yeah. Okay, I'll have somebody meet him, yeah. Oh, pretty good. You know, usual. The client - No. No. No, it's just the usual. Good Well, yeah. Yes. Yes. OK. OK. Thanks a lot for calling, right? Right. Bye. OK. Pass to my right? OK. All right, below me, below me. No, your right. Hold it. Change magazine. I got a call from the office and we spoke this morning. Seems that the label, the real label, is finished now. And they're sending it down to shoot that instead of a prototype. Can we do that today? It's on its way down now. It'll be here - Tom Daley's flying it in... By the time they get to the beach it might be 3:30. You think you could do it today? I don't think so. We're going to have to reshoot. Well, what about the... wait wait a second. What about all the other stuff we did yesterday at the falls? Well, we have to redo that. Well. The label they gave us was a prototype so, you know, now, suddenly, the real one has come through and they want us to - Well what were we doing yesterday?! Were we, you know, jerking off yesterday? Well I didn't think that it was going to be late. Look, Frank... Theres's no reason to run into the extra expense of another day. Well, there may be a reason and we need to play it by ear. I mean, if we can do it here we will do it but if we can't... We'll work it out. Where's that fella Carl? Carl. You know Tom Daley. Tom is coming down on a plane that gets in about 1:00 o'clock. He's got something that we need very, very important. Will you go and fetch Tom and bring him back here. I'll do that. As quick as you can. I'm telling you, the tourist business... The tourist business was good for Jamaica this year and I was happy, I'm particularly happy about the tourist business being good this year because I try my best to tell the people all about the tourist business because the tourist business is the money business and the money business is the rent business, and you can't make unless you've got some money! So go get some money and once you get some money, you just might get some love So you live in Montego Bay? No, I'm not from Montego, I'm really from Kingston, but I go three times a week for work. What kind of work? I dance. Oh? No, I'm only going there for an audition. I really work with Ivan often. You serious? Why? You know? I know for Ivan for a long time, we used to dance. So you're a dancer? You really know Ivan? Look, I like you, I can't figure out where we meet before. Matter of time. I guess there's a time for everything. Not everybody understands that. But I do. That's why I don't mess it myself with just any and everybody, my dear. You care to stop for a drink? Thanks for the lunch. If it wasn't for you, I would still be out there in that hot sun, you know. You think so? What time do you have to get in? Not until later this evening. As a matter of fact, I think I might just rest of here. And go back in the cool. If you're interested... There's a place I could take you. Okay. Bring two beers. Leave a car. I'm going to take a ride. When asked about the recent raids in western Jamaica, the commissioner said they would continue until he was satisfied that the link between hippy tourism and the drug trade were severed, and he wants to send a strong message. Hey Tom. Hey Carl. I just barely missed you. I've been here now for about three hours waiting for you. I didn't know what to do. Got out the plane. I didn't see you. I took the cab, about a million cab guys. You really got some competition here. I mean, I never expected you guys on down here to hustle. Carl? What happened? What happened this afternoon? A problem with the car, that's all. That's just not good enough. I mean, I've got to have you doing what you're supposed to be doing. I've got to have some results from you or that's it. I don't need you on the set anymore. All right. Tom, I'll see you. What about money, Carl? I get paid every day. What about today? It doesn'tmatter. I'm sorry about what happened. That's cool but next time just tell him how I operate. But you know... It's alright. It's alright. She's gone. She just took off. Well, she went with this driver that we have on the thing and I just got a lead on him... Huh? Taxi driver, man did we put on the production, hun. I'm going now to a nightclub to find him. See if he can help me to find her. I've got to find her. I've got to bring it back to New York. We've got to have her there next week. I don't know what kind of man he is, he's a taxi driver, he seems... Well, he's about six feet tall and he's got a face... Yes, I am. Yes. Yes. I'm being silly, but the point is this. I've got to get the girl. I've got to bring her back to New York so I won't be back until Monday. Would you call your office and tell them that? No, I don't think I am. No, Jeff, that is not... Well maybe it is. Yeah. All right. It is. I do need the time. OK. No, I don't need five days. I have to be in New York on Monday. I'll be back. Jeff, let me have a couple of days, if I'm not back in New York then you call the embassy. I'm not gonna go out and beat the bushes. It's a civilized country. I'll be fine. It's hard to find a guy that really blows your mind. And you just dig everything he does. Like. Like when he gives you that great big special hug and that heavy kiss. Girls. You know the kind, the kind that's in the wrong place at the wrong time. And it really turns you on. Then that time happens to all of us. We had an argument. And like all and I mean all those girls, I said some pretty dumb things [music [ends] Hello! Can we speak for just a minute? Yes we could. Sit down? Oh, thank you. Sorry. Carl, I have a problem. We've lost here. Oh I don't know she's taken off. Someone told me that she went off with you the other day. She left with me and I give her a ride to the bus terminal. She told me that she was getting out of here. Well, I've got to find her. I mean, I've got to take her back to New York with me. Well, we might head that way tomorrow. So you could probably travel with me. What time would be convenient for you? About 9:00 in the morning, or so? 9:00, 10:00, I can pick you. OK, great. Pick me up at the hotel. Thank you very much. You're leaving? No... I don't want to interrupt your evening. This is Virgie. You know, she's responsible for this show, you know. No kidding! Beautiful. So, you know, sit down. We used to dance together when he first came to north coast. You still dance? Not anymore, my dear. Not with a family and three children. You want something to drink? Did you just feel that you had to be running? To be famous? And what do you have to be to be famous? And you, did you come? So you gave up the idea of being famous. How famous? That's how you came to us. I'd forgotten that Tom told us he had this man who knew all about Jamaica. How to put his hands on everything immediately. But when I saw you, boy, when I saw this old car, I thought there is no way that is our man. Well, I'm afraid it ended badly for you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that it happened. There isn't anything left to love. I mean, the man has become papers and, and... Problems. No, you can't go away, see, not when you work like he does. If you go away, there's another lawyer in another office and your client can just go right there. Knock on that man's door... That man can solve his problem and make up the paper you would make up. He loves what he does and he's very successful. I mean, it only costs him... 17 hours every day. Sunday's off most of the time. And things that he can't eat, you know, because his stomach burns, this burning. And me. I mean me too, you know. I find you just... Couldn't go any more. So that's all it costs him but he's successful and, so he loves it. You can't say that. Well, you need to bring him to Jamaica, I'll help him relax. What would he do here? Bring him down, man. No. You don't know... You don't know that problem, that pressure. When you go inside, you see this coral, beautiful polished coral. You're sitting back in the cave. You look outside. You see the vines coming down. You say to yourself "This is an impossbile place to be, right? How many places can exist?". It sounds perfect. If Adam and Eve, if you know they were, this is where they woulda been. Because if they weren't here then they made a mistake. When I was a kid, I used to watch Tarzan swinging on the vines, you know. Like this is almost like getting back to that trip, back into nature. I threw all my shoes away. I threw all my shoes away. That means you're not going back, right? Well, I'll buy a pair of shoes if I go back. They take pictures and they show their friends. Next thing you know, they get on a plane and they're coming down. Two and two is four and eight and sixteen and thirty two. The progression of life... Carl, any word from PJ? Good. Put your arm on the sign. Your store. Want to make it look good. OK. Beautiful. Perfect. I made this one year. This is most effective to me. It softens the hair and grows to hair long. What you read is what you get. The customers demands it, asks for it. Well, now, why is it you advertise? How do they know? I don't advertise it. Sometimes I go advertise it in the store. But he'd advertise it himself? When one customer buy it they tell each other. What we call a 'word of mouth.' You know? Yes, I know. It's great. You don't need an advertising agency. I don't totally need it. If you put everything on your package, you just tell what it does, tell how to use it, and then try and sell it. Hi. How are you all doing? Good? I'm glad I see you all now. I'm going off to Kingston for a little while so I could call it a rental. It's a bit early, but... How you doing? I'm alright. Any complaints? Everyone giving me seedy bush. Just got to compensate for that. Take care. - All right, bye. It's you, it's you, it's you I'm talkin' to! Wanted for theft. We know who you are and you're going to get caught. Those who steal are a burden to those who pay. The penalty for stealing electric power is prosecution, fine, or a term in prison. If you are stealing... You are wanted. ...Yesterday broke ground for a 600 room hotel. Turning to the long term development plans, Mr. Cableton listed the building of an air strip and of a telephone system. The expansion of clinical and health facilities... Money, money, money, money, money. Give me some money man. Got to be our love on one foundation. Got to be all love, on one foundation. There will never be, yeah, no love at all. There will never be, no love at all. Got to put aside Maybe segregation, yeah Got to put aside... Got to put aside... There will be no love at all Got to build our love on one solid foundation. Got to build our love on one foundation. Or there will never be a single drop of love Got to build our love on one foundation What does it mean when people yell like that from the side of the road? Really? I fix something... So, it probably running with no problem. Then it needed a fix. But they can only fix it one time. Then it broke down. And not it's the way it is. Every little little thing is the way it is. Anything at once. Right? Right. ...Living in Kingston, it was not right for me. Water pollution. Sometimes your nose burn when you take a deep breath. You just feel upset, you know? So I say I cannot stay in the city here. That place is not my home. The doctor told me that I had prostate cancer. So, I got to leave the town and come to the country and do some farming. See if I could get rid of this terrible disease that is messing up my whole body. So when I come to country it's what I do to get rid out of it. So when I go back to the doctor, the doctor asks me 'How did I get rid of that thing?" And I can say I eat and feed on the vegetable like ocra and carrot and all those things, you know? I find myself in the bushy part of the country hills here. Here where these nice birds are singing... You know, and I do a little farming and taking a nice breeze, the breeze is fresh, man. You know, it is so very nice to get up in the morning, take a walk... Here in Jamaica it's no exception... Yes, to the extra satisfaction. I hear the wind callin' me away... They're not going to leave space for you, Carl. Can't you see that? They'll run right over you. You're from the Spanishtown ploice station, yes? - Yes sir. Can you tell us what the situation is in Spanishtown? Well there's... Let's see... Operator, can you connect me with the Kingston airport? I'm trying to reach the Kingston Airport. No, no, no. I did dial. I can't get through. Well, uhh, Air Jamaica. Yes. I will hold. Get up in the morning slaving for bread, sir... So that every mouth can be fed... Ohh, the Israelites. Get up in the morning slaving for bread, sir... So that every mouth can be fed... Ohh, the Israelites. My wife and my kids are packed up to leave me... Darling, she said, I was yours to be seen. Shirt them a tear-up, trousers are gone... I don't want to end up like Bonnie and Clyde. After a storm there must be a calm... They catch me in the farm, you sound the alarm. Things fall apart. The center cannot hold. Mere anarchy is loose on the world. The slacker prediction... And the worst are full of passion and intensity. We need to examine the social relationships that are giving rise to this phenomenon, and why is it that people have lost their confidence in commissioners of police and others. Because the state has failed. It cannot guarantee to the people order and justice. And seems to be making no real effort. Politics is about self-interest, not the public interest. It's about party. The public interest must be subservient to these considerations. The cost of it, to this society, is severe. And it is going to become even more so. Yeah Alfred. Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. OK, I'm finished. Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Jamaica paradise hotel. How can I help you? I believe a Carl James works there. Can I speak to him, please? Mr. James is the manager of the hotel, ma'am, and he is late for a meeting. But if you leave your number, I'll be sure to give him the message that you called. Yes, stay for a minute where the rum come from... The rum come from, the rum come from... Relax and have some fun. The weather may be cold as ice, cold as ice... I can tell my people that Freddy will hlep us. Listen, in two weeks we'll option this place. And we build it in a few years, and we run in to profits for the past 18 months, so... This beach here is worth ten fields, and the Goldmans is aware of that. So. I'm chairman of this one committee and we plan to develop the entire beach. Essence of sunflower oil to renew life, life is sun itself... Perhaps the only shampoo on earth inspired by the sun. He was morning and I was nighttime... When they woke up to find him lying beside my bed. For I've been lonely in need of someone... As though I done someone wrong somewhere, but I don't know where. You are the sun, I am the moon, you are the words, I am the tune... Song he sang to me... Words he brang to me. You are the sun, I am the moon... You are the words, I am the tune... And so it was that I came to travel, up on a road that was found and now in another place... You are the sun, I am the moon, you are the words, I am the tune. You are the sun, I am moon, you are the words, I am the tune. You are the sun, I am the moon, You are the words, I am the tune...
