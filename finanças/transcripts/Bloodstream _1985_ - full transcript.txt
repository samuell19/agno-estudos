What's wrong? I'm dying. Martin! I must, I must ... Stay here, I'll get help. Good opening. Shut up, Simon. We must be careful. He could be hiding anywhere. He's coming! Run! Coffee, Nikki. Yes, Mr. King. You were good. Give me the tape. You do know what kind of audience this film is aimed at? I think so. Tell him, Simon. Curry brigade. That's right, a takeaway curry after the pub. Yeah, four pints of beer, a chicken madras, and a horror video. Exactly, blood and tits, a few scares, a few thrills, nothing too demanding. But I did everything you wanted. This wouldn't frighten a four-year-old. I'm telling you, it's crap. It doesn't work, it's rubbish. Yeah, better luck next time. There won't be a next time. You had a golden opportunity and you blew it. You'll never work for me again. I'll make sure of that. If I were you, I'd get a proper job. You're finished in the film industry. How do you know it won't sell? I've put everything into that film. you just can't write it off. Don't tell me my job! I know what's commercial, okay? Bloodstream stinks! I'm not wasting money promoting it. But what about my share of the profits? I've lived off peanuts for three months. What am I gonna do for money? That's your problem. You've wasted plenty of mine. I can sue you. I've got the contract. You won't get away with this! Have you read your contract? Of course. Do you have your copy? Yeah. Give it to me. You really should read all the small print, you know, before you sign anything. Yes, clause 27 states, if at any time I am not satisfied with the progress of the production, I am entitled to amend our agreement or render this contract null and void. That's just what I'm doing. This is now worthless. No! You bastard! I worked my guts out for you. Bloodstream's a bloody good film! Get him out of here! No, you can't do this! No, you lying bastard! I did everything you wanted me. You can't do this! No, you lying bastard! Yes, he was right. It's a bloody good film. It could make a fortune. You really are a bastard. [Mr. King Voiceover] It doesn't work. It's rubbish. Yeah, better luck next time. [Mr. King Voiceover] There won't be a next time. You had a golden opportunity and you blew it. You'll never work with me again. I'll make sure of that. If I were you I'd get a proper job. You're finished in the film industry. We've got to get to the generator before they do. But they're everywhere! Make a run for it. No, I can't leave you! Go on, run! Et cetera, et cetera. This is for Arthur Freeman in New York. As you are no doubt aware, your U.S. distribution rights on The Lust Machine expire next month. Considering the enormous expenses of that film, I feel sure you'll be interested in handling my new production, Bloodstream. I enclose the trailer cassette for you to view prior to your visit to England next month for the European Video Convention. When you arrive here, please telephone my office to arrange a meeting to discuss the financial arrangements. This film's rubbish. Get rid of it, Nikki. Send it back or just throw it away. That's not funny, David! Did you hear that? Must be the bogeyman. Oh, grow up! Becky! Ow, shit! Jerry, I don't want excuses. I've got contracts in every english-speaking market ready to buy Bloodstream. I'm in business to make money. I'm not running a charity here. That's a lot of cash. If you can't get the prints ready in time I'll just have to use another lab, it's as simple as that. Okay, but remember that doesn't mean next week. I want them tomorrow, okay? Do you find me ugly? Then look again. I'll come a little closer. You think I'm repulsive, don't you? You're all the same as all the rest. Shall I cut this off, so that you can kiss me? 'Cause that'd be exactly what you want, isn't it? if you send me inside, you know what they'll do. They'll skin me alive. They'll feed me to the dogs. Kill me. Pleaese! Hello? Oh, hello. Is that Alistair Bailey? Hello, it's Nikki here, William King's secretary. Yes? I have some information which I'm sure will interest you. About Bloodstream. I can help you Alistair. How? Do you know the bar on the corner of Connaught Road? I'll go there straight from the office. I'll expect you to be waiting for me. Do you want another? Um. It's all right, I'll get them. I know you haven't got any money. Not yet anyway. Pint of Essen and a gin and tonic, please. What can we do? I'm not sure yet. But I'll keep in contact. I've watched William King manipulate and humiliate too many people. It's time to somebody played him at his own game. Cheers. Cheers. It's Etta Freeman for you on your private line. Okay, you're through. You'll double your money within two months. You know I'm right. Besides having a commercial movie, you've got a great poster design. The Bloodstream campaign works. Over 20,000 tapes have been sold in Canada alone. The movie's an established hit in Europe as well. Why haggle over the price? Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch! Burn the witch, burn the witch! I'm not a witch! Let me go! Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch! Help me! Curse you! Curse you all! I'll be back! Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch! Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch! Burn the witch, burn the witch, burn the witch! Burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him! Burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him! It's all right. You were dreaming. They were burning me. King was there and his wife. They were all there. It was just a bad dream. They wanted me to die. Don't let him get to you. I'll put tape on. I thought Bloodstream was gonna be my big break. After film school I drifted from job to job for 12 years. Then along came Bill King and offered me the opportunity of a lifetime. I hate the bastard. Just be patient. You know they say revenge is sweet. You smoke too much. Is Simon in? I think he's downstairs. Come on down. I've got some dictation. Have you got the contracts for Path to Hell yet? They're still being drawn up. For Christ's sake, I should've had them yesterday! Get off your ass and go and get them! And if they're still not ready, wring Dan Sidney's neck until they are. And don't sod about talking! Come straight back. I want to see that artwork you've been farting round with. These should keep you going for a day or two. Great. Thanks. But first you should watch this. Go on, put it on. I've been doing a little research. Miss Judy Brooks, your favorite actress. I hate the bitch. Judy Brooks isn't her real name. Before King got hold of her, she was an Linda Rawlings. She was basically a high-class whore who happened to fall into King's greasy hands. Sleeping with the producer definitely helped her career. Who are you? Ludvilla. What are you doing? Such warm pleasure. Such an elegant neck. Ludvilla! Come on, you promised! Leave us! I can give you eternal life. No! You'll send me to hell! Greg Hellman. How did you get on with him? I didn't. I don't know how he's made it as an actor. His real name is Kevin Biltin. He started in porno rubbish like this. King put him under contract, gave him acting and elocution lessons. Neither worked, but that doesn't really matter in a King production, as long as he does what he's told and struts a lot. Then there's Simon. We both know what a little shit he is. Being King's brother-in-law has given him illusions of grandeur. Together with his more than healthy interest in the female anatomy, he's not a very pleasant person to work with. And just like the others, he's literally owned by the man. His job, house, even his car, they're all supplied by William King. I couldn't find out much about his wife Sally. She used to be a model but gave up her career to dedicate herself to King. Their daughter, Lisa, was 19 last month. A Torian like you. She's following in her mother's footsteps, helped of course by daddy's contact. Her modeling career, her new flat, both made possible by William King, the man who seems to gain enormous pleasure from controlling other people's lives. You've been busy. Now I know about them. What about you? I know nothing about you. What do you want to know? Anything. Where you live. Why you like me. There's nothing to tell. I'm just an ordinary girl. But I do love you. I've labeled all the keys. We now have access to all his properties. What next? Is the camera gear ready? It will be. Don't worry. Alistair, come here. I want to see if this fits. Good, eh? You didn't know I could sew. Perfect, look. The Angel of Death. How much longer? We'll just have to wait for the right moment now. Oh, Alistair. King International. Yes, he is. Hold on please. Judy Brooks for you on your private line. Your through. When? Next weekend? I told Sally I'll be away at a video convention. We'll have to be careful. Don't you have a housekeeper? Just a woman who comes in to clean on Mondays and Thursdays. I'll bring the food. And I'll supply the champagne. Are you sure Sally won't be suspicious? Why should she? We'll go in separate cars. Who's going to follow us anyway? I have to be back by Sunday afternoon. I've got an early morning call on Monday. And you know what this new director's like. I won't get my lines until Friday. Learn them at the cottage. Oh, no. We'll have better things to do than that. Well I've already told Sally I'll be back late Sunday. Take a script to read. You'll be alone for a change. And it sounds like I'll need a rest before I drive home. Maybe. Well I don't intend playing Scrabble. I can't wait. See you on Friday, darling. You haven't lived until you've tasted human flesh. When you think of all the worthless people in the world, wouldn't it be sensible for them to provide protein for the worthwhile people like myself? Join me for dinner, or tomorrow you'll be the dinner. Like it? What is it? What part of the body? Rump. My dear, you're eating your husband's ass. What crap. Hello. Why did I have to meet you here? To celebrate. What? It's time. When? Soon. This weekend. Sooner than we'd hoped. And an ideal opportunity. What are we looking at? Just faces. People's faces. I won't come back to your flat tonight. Not until after the weekend, in fact. I'll phone you with the final details. Now, what do you want to eat? It's my treat. Drink your wine. Cheers. I can't hang around for a decision. No, I'm leaving the office in a moment. You're holding me up. No, not this weekend! I'm sick of your excuses! No, no, I've told you I'm leaving the office. I've more important things to do than see you. You're on your own, son! I can't help it, it's your problem. Piss off! Okay, okay, I'm sorry. We'll sort it out next week. I'm off. I'll be late in on Monday, okay? Yes, Mr. King. If my wife phones, Nikki, I've left for the video convention. Okay. Lisa. Hello. Who? Oh yeah. I'm sorry to phone you during a session, but your father asked me to ring you. It's rather urgent. He needs to see you tomorrow. Why, what's wrong? I'm sorry, I don't know. He just asked me to arrange for him to call at your flat tomorrow morning. Hold on, I'll check my diary. What time? Okay. Bye. Hello? Yeah, he is. Greg. Hello? Hello, Nikki. Tonight? Well I was going out. Important, is it? Yeah, well he is the boss. I'll be in. Oh, that's alright. Cheers. You're working late, Nikki. Not feeling well? No, fine. You gonna be much longer? Maybe about half an hour or so. Here, take my keys. You can lock up. Aren't you working this weekend? Oh, no. While the cat's away, won't be needing the keys. Doing anything exciting? Not really, no. Going over to my sister's. Have a rest. Better than working here. Got to get on. I'll see you Monday. Bright and early. It's only me. I know, I know! No, I'm working out, that's why I'm breathing hard. No, you'll have to go on your own. I'm sorry, but Bill King's calling around. I didn't know till this afternoon. Well it's not my fault, is it? God knows. Well if you're gonna act like that, I don't know when I'm gonna see you. It's too quiet. Wait here. You're dead, bitch. Can you only fight women, Hagan? Your mine, Strike. I'll rip your throat out, no weapons. A fair fight? Yeah. Oh, Strike. Yeah? Nikki. Can I see you? What are you talking about? Come here, now. It's nearly two. What's gone wrong? Nothing, I killed him. I don't like being on my own. I'm frightened. No Alistair, I mustn't see you yet. I can't sleep. I need you here. Just think of what that pig's done to you. Yes. When will I see you? Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever it's safe to meet. Now try to relax. Yes. Goodnight, Alistair. Goodnight. Come on. You've gotta get out. My dad's coming soon. Oh, God. Hurry up. He'll kill me if he catches you here. Well give me a chance to get my clothes on, for Christ's sake. Hurry up. All right! I'll phone you. Why don't you take Cleo for a walk? You trying to get rid of me? No! But you don't have to protect me. I'm quite used to Bill being away at the weekends. Anyway, you're looking a bit pale. You need some fresh air. Aha, your lover is calling around. No! Oh go and cut some firewood. Take Cleo with you. I'm not taking her. She gets in the way. I'll leave her to protect you. Cleo? Cleo! Come here, you stupid mutt! Go on, Cleo, go and find Simon. Go find Simon, go on. No! No! Simon? Cleo? Simon! Simon? Simon, what are you playing at? Burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him, burn him! Can you hear me? Yes. What is your name? Teresa. How old are you, Teresa? 19. Leave her! Help me. Your name is Teresa! You are 19! No! You cannot destroy me. You do not have the power. Leave this child! Take me if you must! But leave this child in peace! Police! Quickly! No! No! Help! Let me go! Help! No, no! No! No, no! No, get off me! Get off me! Where are you going? What the hell are you doing? What are you gonna do? I'll scream the place down. It's you, Alaister. What are you-- I hate the sound of your voice. You wanted a horror movie, King. Well I've made the best horror movie you'll ever see. Watch the screen. This is real horror, nothing's faked. I didn't have to worry about censorship. so I could do anything I liked. Look at the screen. Don't miss my finest work. You told me I'd never make a good film. Greg's last performance was definitely his best, very convincing. Sit down, King. I don't want you to miss anything. Your daughter died beautifully. Such a pretty girl. She could have gone far if only she'd lived a little longer. Don't leave, the best is yet to come. Simon's murder was particularly nasty, befitting one of the cheap videos you've made so much money from. I think you'll appreciate that tastelessness of this scene. It's such a shame your late wife couldn't watch this with you, or indeed your faithful dog to curl up by your feet. I thought I might be going too far killing the dog, but I just couldn't resist the visual effect. Judy proved a difficult subject, but I silenced her forever. I'm sure you'll agree that that was a superb display of screen violence. But the show's over now, King. You're not going anywhere. You're finished. You'll never cheat anyone again. My God, you're insane! You, you-- Shut up. It's too late to say anything now. You're the one I really want to kill. Sit down. I'll give you anything you want. Money. Anything. Alistair, I'm sor-- It's starting. Remember, whatever happens, you must do what I told you. It's the only way you can help me now. Yes, Carl. Get away from me! Wouldn't frighten a four-year-old. Mutilated bodies. After the massacre, he shot himself with his own revolver. No one can be certain of his motives. It appears after leaving his office early Friday afternoon, William King systemically called on those closest to him. The police have not yet released details of their murders other than they were all in extremely sadistic and violent nature. We have with us in the studio today Dr. Ronan Cleave, who is researching the effect of media violence on society. Dr. Cleave, why would a successful businessman who has made a fortune from distributing films with both violent and pornographic content commit such atrocious crimes with no apparent motive? Well, continual exposure to violence can in certain cases trigger off seemingly pointless acts of aggression. Often a person can be quite unaware of the subconscious effects and then suddenly turn into, shall we say, a Mr. Hyde character built up over the years watching these sick and depraved films. Surely it could be argued that violent films could satisfy one's aggressive side. Alistair. Pornography can prevent certain people committing sexual offenses. You were brilliant! Without this outlet, who knows what-- It worked perfectly. The police have been at the office all day, and they don't suspect a thing. How do you feel? Good. And what did you think of your check? What? Haven't you opened your mail yet? Look. What? It's yours. I changed the contract. There's no clause 27. This is just the start. With all the publicity Bloodstream's getting, you're gonna make thousands and thousands. Alistair, we're going to be rich. Why did you do this? It's all right. Who will know? They're all dead. I've put the new contract in the safe. It's the perfect plan. We'll be able to leave this dump. I told you to burn that. You just wanted the money! It's our money, we earned it. You're just as greedy as they were! You don't think I did it for the good of my health do you? But I thought you hated them. I did! I thought you wanted them dead. You fool. You were supposed to destroy this. If anyone gets hold of it, we're finished. Leave that alone. For God's sake, it's over now. With the money you can make other films, when we're married. I've made a great film. Everything in it's real. Listen to me. Sit down. I'll help you. You want to burn everything. You want to burn me, like they did! I don't! I want to help you! No! You just want to burn me! I don't, let me go! I don't want the money! I don't want anything. Just leet me go. No, no! Help! Help! Somebody please help! No, no, let me go! No, leave me alone! Leave me alone! Cut. Just wait till I get out of here. I'm gonna make a bloody marvelous film!
