[Distorted speech] MAN: I don't know who told you that, but we'll--we will sell a colored man a boat just as quick as we will anybody. We're colorblind down here. Hell, it don't make a damn if they're Vietnamese, they come from Brazil... I don't give a shit. But whoever said that about me, I wish they'd come by and tell me themselves. I'll sell a black man a boat quicker than a cat can lick his ass, and that's--that's the way I feel about it. I was brought up that way. We didn't know any prejudice. We were all just brothers together, and that's the way I feel about it now.

You know, it seems to me that a man in his right mind can figure out something better to do than talk on a telephone all day long. Well, what do you think I should do, Daddy? You got any tips for me? Because I don't know what I ought to do. You ought to get in some kind of mental health program. Goddamn, they've got them all over the country. You go down and talk an hour and a half or so a week. You startbuilding bulding a life. They have group people that get together. Goddamn, they got-- The Salvation Army's got some of them. Well, would you take me down to Salvation Army? I won't take you nowhere. That's part of the Goddamn problem! This Goddamn dependency shit. Just get away from the telephone.

Why, sure, honey. Here's a little something for your trouble. [Telephone ringing] Ha ha ha! Triple K Marine. PENROD: It's awful sad about your boat. Where are you gonna live now, Daddy? It's none of your Goddamn business. You carry insurance? That's none of your business. That's a shame. Haywood used to say insurance, credit, and a last will and testament most important things in life. Who are you, Goddamn it? Please tell me. I've got to know.

You remember her, don't you? She's dead, Daddy. She died a long time ago. People die! Yeah. Truer words was never spoke, Daddy. What was your favorite feature of Mama's? Go to hell! She had real pretty teeth, real white ones. That's what I remember best. I don't know nothing about no Goddamn white teeth. Course, I only seen her in pictures. What are you talking about? You don't remember her teeth? I don't remember a Goddamn thing about her! Really, Daddy? Look. I've fucked a lot of whores in my time. Maybe I fucked your mother, maybe I didn't. I don't know. You're a mean man, Daddy. You was mean to my mama. [All chanting, "Go!" [Grunting] BILLY PRESTON: * Sweet land of liberty * You still don't remember her? I didn't want to hurt nobody. Oh, you do remember her, don't you, Daddy? * Land where my father died * * Land of... * What do you want from me? I want you to know how Haywood and my mama felt. [Voices whispering] Leave me alone, will you? I'm begging. You shouldn't hurt people like that, Daddy. [Voices whispering] [Woman squeals] [Whispering continues] * Zu Zu Mamou * * Ooh, ooh * * Ooh, ooh * * Ooh, ooh * * Ooh, ooh... * How do I know I am your daddy? How do you know that, boy? Because Mama died when I was born, Daddy. She seen how white I was, white like you. I believe that's what killed her. She--she died? That's right, Daddy. You was gone from that camp. Then Haywood seen what you done, so he was nice to Mama. He married her. And then later when she died, he brought me up all by hisself. Poor Haywood. What, Daddy?

I'll catch it. I'll get it. Go to hell. PENROD: Daddy? What do you want now? I'm gonna be leaving now. Good. That's good. Ain't you got nothing to say to me? Yeah, I got something to say to you. Get fucked, you nigger son of a bitch. You ain't got no friends, Daddy. I feel sorry for you. Go to hell. That dark man that cut your hair, he's your friend. You treat him bad just like Haywood. I told you I don't know no Haywood. Yeah. What you did to Mama? You's a snake. Fucked a lot of whores. You a sorry old man. [Dial tone] Have you got a Goddamned... rubber neck? Maybe you ought to have a Goddamn rubber neck. FEMALE VOICE: Please hang up and try your call again. So you can suck yourself. Please hang up. This is a recording.
