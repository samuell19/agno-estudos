What about them sneeze production? When are they starting? Sneeze productions took you of the franchise as well. Sneeze production canceled the franchise? But this is a franchise, they can't shoot the movie without me. I already did part one and two. Yeah, I told them that. But they weren't.. - Isn't there supposed to be some kind of legal immplications to this? Yes Boss, I am looking into it. Why don't you get our Lawyer to.. You know what, never mind. Em, that's not the point. Okay, a Mr Van Wick, we need to speak to him. I need you to call him, we can't loose that endorsement. Yes Boss, I will call him right away. You know what, nevermind. Let me call him myself. I'll call him. Mr Vanwick - Hello my great friend Hi Mr Vanwick. How are you, how are you doing this fine day? I wanted to call and see how you're doing. Quick one, I know you must have heard or seen this really doctored video making the rounds about me about some troubles with an old man That's not me, okay Um, I met this troll, you know this guy and he wouldn't stop pushing my buttons. Yes there was a slight altercation. But he wouldn't stop. He kept pushing my button. Until I snapped, just for a moment but... I did not hit the old man. That's not me. I respect my elders I take fathers like, you know. Um, that's not me sir, I just wanted to assure you. All is well Frank, I understand. Okay great, you do? Yeah yeah. The media loves a celebrity scandal. You are the biggest celebrity around. They have to make you look bad so that they can sell more. We've seen it all, I understand this. Okay listen, you just made me a really happy man. I'm so happy. You understand what is going on. Everybody needs to eat off this big table. And um, unfortunately bloggers are the worst house guests right Having said that, um my PR team are on top of it, everything is going to be fine. In no time, we're planning a big press release. To refute everything and then we're good. Um I suppose we're fine with the endorsement right? Young Master Frank, you are the best there is, we will go with no one else. Alright thank you sir, thank you. Have a fine day. Man-He is your good friend. How do you feel about taking up the role that was meant for Frank? - Wait, wait um friend. Friend how? Listen um.. Let's get this whole thing straight here. This role was given to me by the producer directly. You know, it had nothing to do with Frank or friendship. Or anything. I got this role from the producer. So you need to get your information straight. Interviewer-we all know the role was meant for Frank Orji. - Well that doesn't concern me. - Let's talk about this video of Frank, circulating the net. - He is your very good friend. - Good is a very, too strong a word to use. - You know we, yeah we're like acquaintances, but not as tight as you're saying. - But you're together a lot. - I see tons of instagram photos with you and Frank Orji. - Wait up a bit. We work, often okay. And then, um yeah of course, because when you're on the job People tend to think y'all are close friends but hey, we're just mere colleagues. - You mean you're not friends with Frank Orji. No. I stayed with them long after my flight. It was announced to ensure he was fine. To ensure he was comfortable before we went ahead to catch our flight. That day. The fact that the video was doctored to a point clearly reveals the malicious intent of its author. Truth Hurts, the online troll. We know how he or she operates. They target people like myself. I'm totally innocent. I rose through the ranks. My early twenties, in this noble profession and most of you know me I've never lifted a finger to hurt anyone. - I've always been respectful of everyone. Look into it and understand purely what this is. That I'm a target. Of online trolls. Thank you for coming out to hear my version. Are there any questions for our Mr Orji? - Yes Er, lady in the back. - Some people will say this is PR damage control Or have you actually gone to see the man, to ensure he's still fine? Mr Frank,. Mr Frank please, You can't do this. You can't do this. You're wicked! You're wicked. You're too wicked. No comments. Mr Frank. - We need this old man to speak. To clear you and say the truth. Arrgh. Let me try and find his number. No comment please! - Yes that is, that is fine. I assure that, that would be just fine. Okay. Thank you. Okay he has agreed to tell his side of the story. He went to the airport to see his son, who works in a private lounge. He bumped into you accidentally. Okay. Okay pay him whatever he wants. Okay. This nightmare has to be over with. On it Boss. - Then he has to release the testimony video on time. Absolutely. Alright. Baby. Well this is where the magic happens. Hold that thought. I don't want distractions over here. Yeah I knew it was you, what do you want? Hmmm When the slap of Frank Orji landed me on the floor. I was looking for a pastor to confess my sins before my iminent death. Then he started kicking me. Marching me on the ground. No mercy at all. Eh. Oh. Please fellow Nigerians, anyday you see snake on one side of the road coming towards you, then Frank Orji on the other end please rush to the side of snake because Frank Orji is a Devil. Frank, are you mad? Did nepa take light in your head you dingbat? You beat an old man. Is your entire generation cursed? Why are you lending yourself to the propagation of stupidity? And surrendering your soul to idiocy for life. Babe, did you really do that? That's not me. Why are you giving me that look? That's not me. - Don't even touch me. That's so mean, how could you be.. No, no, no No, no, no I'm not that guy. This is nothing, this is not me. I'm being set up, babe. - Don't babe me. Babe wait, hey, hey, eh Come back. Babe! Bring this thing back. What is going on with my life? Hilda, what is going on? Frank I need you to calm down. - I'm working on it. - What did I just watch? Gentle men of the press. With immediate effect, Frank Orji is hereby expelled from the Actors Guild of Nigeria. No Producer or any Production Company is allowed to work or do business with him. Hey everyone, what's going on?

Frank Orji, let me tell you. You're messing up. You beat a man old enough to birth you. You see, you meet your waterloo. Yes I understand that they're painting it out to be something different. But that is honestly not the case. Once again. I assure you that he is an amazing client. Yes I... really? Hello ma'am. Really? Thast... Hel...

Well those good old days. - What about you Mr Lawani, what brought you down? - Same as you, bad comments - my own case, after my cheating and divorce scandal bad comments from thousands of people, I don't even know On facebook, twitter, I saw my career going down the drain. - Me too oo Just because of a little scandal, my career ended even before it started. Bros, hmm? Drink oo, drink and forget your sorrows. Cheer up. - Most stars will fall. We pray that, And then we have men like you, who have money you know. Hmm People who can bring value to the table - exactly. - Not all these wish washing people you know. Hm barman Do you know what is easy to forget? People have power. The most powerful is the mouth. Social media represents our mouth. Hence it is as powerful as the words that leave our mouths. But the words and deeds being projected on social media these days are disturbing. One word typed can break a heart. And depress a soul. One picture being shared can break a marriage. Some even use it to broadcast the false representation of their lives. To their followers. Flaunting things they don't own in real life. Fake life makes a huge part of social media today. Today's social media, everyone wants to be a reporter, so they'll rather whip out their phones to record am incident or accident. Rather than render a helping hand to the victim. Many have lost jobs, relationships and families because of their treacherous social media activities Because of their bad comments. Something good came out of it. Like what? God used it to bring you to us now. So this is it? This is forever? Nothing, there's no recourse? We're down and out for good? My brother, you have enjoyed life to the fullest. What else do you want? What about the person that did this to me? That did this to all of us. The people that are doing it. What are you going to do? Track them down and punish them? Listen, the reason why this people flourish is because no one is challenging them. - Think. Is because no one is challenging them is because no one is challenging them Do you even know what that sounds like? It's ill informed, unrealistic and dumb. You know what Boss, I.. I'm not even gonna let you do it, you're not doing it. No. Listen to me arrgh. You're the only one who stood by me throughout this ordeal. I was loosing my mind. Now scratch that, I lost my mind completely. I lost everything but money. Everything. Everybody abandoned me. I.. I don't know where this is leading I just know that if I never get back up, it doesn't matter. But I must get even. Boss what exactly does this accomplish now? What? I don't know Hilda. Maybe I'll be saving the next guy. Fine. Fine. Where do we start? - The name is Roma and I've always wanted to be a blackhat hacker since I was 13. Hmm - Welcome to the interview, Mr Tunde Tornado. Now tell me a little about yourself. Tunde Tornado Tunde Tornado. Oh okay, do you think that you can speak just a little louder? I'm already shouting. What is he saying? This is the loudest I can do. Tunde Tornado. Do you want me or not? Hilda You're our point woman. I want you to make a list of the top trolls in Sub-Saharan Africa. Everyone of them. I want you to design the strategy of approach. And attack. Understood? Got it Boss, on it. Roma, take that list Find them. I want to know where they live. I want to know who their friends are. Who their families are. Where they work, who they work for. Their strengths, their weaknesses. What makes them tick. I want to understand their motives for doing this. If they take a piss, I want to hear live. On camera, understood? Yes boss, I'm already on it. Tornado, I want you to understand your unique position, You are my weapon of choice. You're the street general. I want you to pick your top lieutenants out in the streets and place them strategically. We're going to take pain to them. I want you to make it hurt. Understood? They'll pay for it. Several trolls occupy the social media world, but none as worse as this three. First up, Ojuju. Next we have busy body 2000 Now this troll paints famous people in silly lights provoking tons of millions of bad comments. Which of course make the celebrities upset. And worst of them all, \ Truth Hurts. Now his specialty is having false accusations with audio, video and photo proof. This one started it I want this one first. Go away, get out of my way, I'll... Always claiming to have slept with Nollywood guys apparently. So what is he, gay? Arrrgh, apparently not. He just likes breaking homes of male celebrities. Real name, Maruf Okanle. A tailor from Ikorodu. See his head like a coconut. - What? - I said his head looks like a coconut. Coconut? Yes, his head is a coconut. I'm shouting, can't you guys hear me? Can't you guys hear me? No no, we can hear you. All of you are crazy here. - We can hear you chairman. - Calm down. The guy is very ugly. We know Roma - I DM'd him after we trolled Tiwa Savage, to meet me for a job. Isent him 50k and said I had to see him in person to balance him another 50k. Come in. The biggest celebrity blogger. - How are you? I'm good bro. Got the balance? Here's your balance. How would you be killing the story. Come on. The story will be dead in a few minutes. This is what we do guy, come on. I'm good at this, you know this. But how will you now convince the people that the guy isn't really gay? And that he didn't really sleep with you. I'll come up with the narrative that I mistook his name for someone else. Than the culprit right? Then the story will be dead. Very good, so you're really not gay. Here you go. Alright. Who is next? - Cletus Mbanefo. Loves to troll actresses and female dignitaries. Asking if they enjoyed their night of bliss with him. Common wake up. Huh? What is it? A ha. Who are these guys? What is it? No! Oh my god. Awww. Awwww, Oh my god. Are you crazy? Are you crazy? Why did you do thjs? Crazy. Who propose go fear. God dey. You stupid bitch. Tracy. Just look. Look... Look at her. And the best for the last. I caught one of the big 3. Natasha Adebayor There's something different about this one. Yeah She doesn't fit the mod of your regular troll. Uh huh. None of them look like online trolls. They're lions online and then pussycats in real life. She's too fine. What? She's a goddess of beauty. Huh? Every time, you guys pretend like you can't hear me. Please leave me. Okay, what's her story? Her story is um, teacher of the year, two times in a row. Volunteers with the red cross at her free time and advocates against child abuse. My point exactly, that is not the MO of a troll. Let alone Ojuju uh, maybe her phone was hacked? No Not likely, except her device is being shared. But I don't think her accounts is the problem. It has to be her device. Listen erm, as much as I want to get back at these bastards It will really kill me to hurt an innocent person. Okay then how do we ascertain that? Hey is that not Frank? Oh shit! Frank! It's Frank. Go back guys, whoa! Whoa! - Hey, children stop. oh guys! Stop that, please go into the bus. Go into the bus quickly. Let me get a minute. To the bus, into the bus. Nice to meet you guys. Trust me the love is reciprocal. You wanna help me up please? - Frank Orji. Yes. Erm.. What brings you here? Eh well, I hope you're not gonna kick me down and spit on me - No why would I do that? I'm a huge fan. Oh you are? Well that didn. t stop the others doing the same thing. So um, what brings you here? Just you know coming out here to, Look around and see em, Erm, Oh, I know You're doing research for a movie and you want to use our school as your case study. Oh aren't you quite the genius. That was very quick of the optic Actually I was um, yes, new movie role. Um playing a teacher, thought somebody said come check out this school, and you know see if I can understudy a proper teacher and em, and go from there. Well Mrs Isaac would be glad to do it because she absolutely loves Nollywood movies. But... I think having you in my class will be quite distracting. Looking at what you did to my kids. Hmm uh. Um I think I might have a solution to that one. - Good morning class. - Good morning Miss Tasha. Today we're going to be discussing the addition of decimal fractions and we have an example on the board as you can see. So 0.914 plus 0.035, who can give me the answer? Hmmm 9th question. Calp for her everyone. So here we have that. No no no, it is not a laughing matter. Lady, I am a very rich man. Take a 100 dollar, Lady put your name and phone number. Lady put your name and number, let me take it up. You're going to make my ribs hurt with this.. I could keep this up all day. I like to see you very happy. It's no wonder these kids just adore you. But you know, I wonder what your other face is like. With me, what you see is what you get. Hmm, I beg to differ. I think people have two faces. One they show to the world and the other in the shadows. Frank, that sounds like a line from a movie. Nah this is a line from life. Um well... Tasha is a very happy person. Tasha is happy. And my guilty pleasures are apple martinis the occasional shisha. And sometimes, I google Chaning Tatum's pictures. Oh Jesus, that's dirty. But other than that, there are no skeletons in my cupboard. But yeah, this has been really good but I have to go. It doesn't have to end. I mean for all the research gold you gave me today, Yeah I think I should take you out, I know this good place. I would love to but my mother and younger brother are always at it and I'm the peace maker So I actually have to go, but thank you. Okay so em, by tomorrow, I'm certain you would have been done playing united nation. [{giggles] You crack me up. So maybe we can go get a bite to eat somewhere. Okay, sounds good. I know this good place. Let's get going. Ladies first. So any word on Truth Hurts? Boss Truth Hurts has one of the baddest firewalls I ahve tried and tried and tried. But I'm not gonna give up, I'll keep hacking at it till I get it. - Busybody 2000? Same thing as Truth Hurts, but not as bad or not as complicated. In fact I have a guy that can come up with an algorithm for it. Hm, listen bring in whoever you need to bring in, at whatever cost, okay? I want this cracked. Were you able to link Tasha to Ojuju? Well, no such luck yesterday, I will give it another shot tomorrow. Boss if you ask me, I think Tasha is Ojuju. She might not look it, but she is. Look at this guy, Man With No Name. Nice guy in real life, baddest com mentor online. These guys, these trolls, they are chameleons. I You can't let her deceive you Boss. Very perky. I think there's something different about her. Why? Because she has great lips, hips and curves? Nope. I think there's something beautiful about her inside. So you've been inside her. Wow. Let's just say that if Ojuju happens to be Tasha She'll get served. Like the rest. Madam, whosoever she is, I want her. - Noted. Think I'm in love. Why did I become a teacher? uh huh. To be honest, I don't have a noble answer for that. I didn't have any plans of saving the world, or giving the children a better tomorrow. After school, I got this job and I fell in love with it. You? Hm, fair enough. I bet you always wanted to be an actor. Hmm. You know, I've always wanted this since I was little. I wanted to be famous, I loved the attention. I knew it was my greatest asset, my gift. And so I pushed for it, spoke it into existence you know, strived for it and positioned for it. Hmm, In no time, I think it was my forth year. A production company came to school And then do the film. Yeah. The rest is history. Do you know, uh huh. I mean what do I do really? I came from humble beginnings, I understand what these people are talking about. It's not like I'm some rich kid or some trust fund baby. I worked my butt off for every dime I got. I had to look after my mom. So I just didn't wanna be pulled down by my circumstances. So I strived and used my gift audaciously. Where am I supposed to be blamed for it. So I take the odd picture of my toils, of my achievement and I just wanna look good. To let people understand that you can be anything you want to be, if you strive for it. Uh huh. Believe enough in it. - So true. - And then somebody decides that I'm doing something so wrong, he makes a career of making people like me miserable. How does that play? It's crazy. Are you on social media? Uh huh, twitter and instagram. I see. I suppose then that you know some of the top bloggers. Truth Hurts for instance. Who doesn't know? Everyone does know Truth Hurts. Alright then, I also suppose that you know a masquerade Um if I catch you on the mainland, Ojuju. - Yes we know all of them. - You know Ojuju. Yeah, It's crazy. So my question to you is what kind of low life despicable creature - hm, - will make a career of making other people, I mean wake up in the morning literally dreaming about how to destroy other people's lives. You have to be the lowest of lows Frank, people are angry. They want your life. They study, they work hard, you know... they go out of their way to be everything and still they settle for less. And then some actor goes and buys a whip of 50 million. A footballer throws a wedding of 100 million, and you expect them to say congratulations? They'll say burn in hell. You know. So just before you put out that new endorsement deal. Or that new whip that you bought, Just know that half of your social media followers, are not your fans. They are frustrated people looking for how to vent, and you are just their outlet, trust me. I see. Frank. Frank. Back to earth, I'm here. Message received loud and clear, I'm here. - Um, I have to go. - You haven't even touched your food. Hakeem is outside and I'm with the key, so I need to go home now. Hakeem the boyfriend? Hakeem is my brother. And him and my mother had a fight. So he's staying with me for a few days. - Okay so, I'll.. - I just called my, I already called a cab. Don't do that, cancel. - No cancel seriously. - It's off your route. You are my route. Heh. Aunty Kaffy, I swear to god I tried. If mum is telling the truth, she'll say I tried. I went to those interviews mhen, jobs are useless. Okay so what about the toyota we bought for you? No Uber is beneath you. Uncle Jemide's company, you said he's too hard to work with. Okay we said, look for an idea, so we can add money for capital. Hakeem till now, nothing. Three months, that's all you have in my house and I am not joking. Frank please let me quickly go and change. I'll be back. - Where am I going to sleep? - On my head. So um, 6 months in kirikiri yh? What was it like? She told you I was in prison? There's nothing to be ashamed of. It's a private family matter now. Why does aunty Kaffy like to expose me? She didn't mean it that way. She said you were one of the 26 year olds that were caught on Odolume street for fraud. Mhen that's on TV, that's casting. - Boss, you won't understand. - Come on I do understand. I really do. See, this is not my real face. And forget the professor look and everything, we're both men. Why don't we talk man to man or like men. - Growing up, you want to get shit like that in Unilag. I used to just find something to push to school. Making clothes, making shoes. You know I started this yahoo thing last year, after I graduated. And under a few month, I became Hakeem the hacker. The don, the baddest. My maga success ratio was 90% you know bro, after a few months, I bought benz I bought prado, I rented a flat at Oniru. I used to dash mum and dad money, even Aunty Kaffy, I used to dash her money. Although I lied that it was a contract job. But then I got busted. They took me to Kirikiri. Then since I came out, but.. - Well I can understand. One minute you're in the Prados and Benzos, and then.. Hey that's actually a rhyme you know? Well. But you know.. When they started talking about Uber, it didn't obviously sit well with you. I swear to God bro, you get it. This guy bam. But you know Hakeem, being on the straight and narrow has it's rewards, you'll be able to sleep well at night. With you eyes closed. It may not make as much money as yahoo, but you know A kid as smart as you, can be anything they want. I swear to god bro, you're old. This generation, it's either music or maga. Nah but it doesn't work that way. You spent 4 years paying your way through school Hakeem. That means you understand what hard work is. I'm telling you all you need to do is get a proper job, stay on the street, A kid as smart as you will make it, eventually. Bro let me tell you something, this regular job vibes My family would be happy, but me, I'll be depressed. Trust me Hakeem, we're both in the same boat. And I think I'll make you understand that. - Boss! Frank Orji. - Right. - Mad oo - I told you. Aunty Kaffy, please come. - What is it? What's going on? Your new ugly boyfriend is actually Frank. Frank Orji. I told you. - Mad oo - Is that why you were calling me? Wow, you look gorgeous. Hey, look at you. How are you, you just having fun? - Come here. Hey. He's just a kid. Jezebel mom. Nice one, I will holla at you alright. Nice one boss. - You got it? - I got it. Okay, wow. So what's next? I mean Boss, ever since you started talking to Tasha, Ojuju has stopped posting. I mean, doesn't that ring a bell? I need a few days with her till I figure this out. Everything will pan out. Eventually, alright. Few days. Oh my god. Sorry. Somebody help please, somebody help. Sorry, sorry To the best team. - We did it. - Yes - I told you we will do it. I know we could. Boss, it's you. You've all done a good job. Yeah yeah. Thank you. Roma could you get the door?

I honestly didn't get that. Leave me alone. - It's okay, don't go there. Okay. Okay, on the left is the lady of the house okay, she pieces it together trust me. My manager per excellence. Hilda. - Oh hi, I've heard so much about you. Hi, and so have we. So much about you. Okay. That's fine, thank you very much. Oh, oh! Argh. hey. Thank you. Hey. Wow. Argh. I'm so sorry about that. I'll have a word with his manager or somebody. This... like, wow. Wow, well That's my world in black and white. Now you understand why I pay top dollar for private spaces like this. - Yes. Yeah you become invisible to hostiles but now the hostiles are insiders You're accepting this instead of fighting it. Who do I fight? Where do I start from? I'm spiritually drained. The world, I mean life is life. People will be people. I am who I am regardless. No, I just decided to focus my energy on something a lot better. Makes sense. Hey listen, here, put it here. To the good life and love. What's the problem? There's trouble. Boss. Tasha Kafilat Adebayor, celebrated Basic 3 teacher, Is also the famed notorious troll, Ojuju. Is also the secret lover of the disgraced, violent, fallen Nollywood star, Frank Orji. Boss, they even tagged a video to this thing. Truth Hurts Boss what do we do? Did you by any chance, link Ojuju's account to Tasha's IP address? Sir. All evidence points that she is not Ojuju. She can't be, it's not possible. Then find him! I will. But boss you know I have tried, this thing is not easy, it's not a small matter. - I've tried. - I want this bastard. This bastard is drowning me. This person is drowning me. - You have to find him. - Boss, I have tried. This person's skill is mad. This person is a hacker, it's not something I can just hack This person knows what he's doing. So what you're telling me, is that in this whole universe, there's no hacker badder than this person? Never, too many bad boys all over the net. Fine let me speak a language you understand. 2 million. Get me a hacker for 2 million that will find Truth Hurts, I want this person found in 24 hours. Boss. Boss. Boss now. You need That's your 2 million, I want that hacker. Go. Get to it. Alright boss. Hey guys. Oh God! You should have kept this indoors. I mean going out, going out to eat, that's what caused this. So she is Ojuju. Yeah, bad guy, did you get my message? Frank, why are they doing this to me? They almost cost me my job. Because of my history, they suspended me for 2 weeks but with pay. Atleast they don't want to loose me. But what I don't understand is why anyone would think I'm a social media troll. Like I don't even see the connection. Um, what device do you use for social media? My phone. Yeah, but what way did you get the phone? My cousin in England gave it to me. Why? It's no big deal, it's nothing. I think you should come over to mine for a few days. Or at least till this blows over. Just to look after you. Protect you, make sure you're okay. Everything is going to be fine. Hello Hilda. What! Roma! Is he gonna be okay? Roma! Roma! Roma. What's going on? I don't know.. What happened to him? I don't know. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? He just... he just collapsed. Sir I don't know what happened I don't know. Tasha is outed. The old man saga is dredged and Roma falls ill. No, no no honestly, all of these, all these feels very very connected. I don't care. I'm just really concerned about everyone around me. Obviously, we're being targeted. I need you guys to be really careful. I want you guys to give me some room. I need at least a 40 foot distance away from me Who is next? Everybody around me is getting destroyed. Okay you know what? I'm gonna run you a hot bath to get you out of this funky mood. Alright. Hello. - Boss I did it. 200k. I did it bro. Did what? You said if I can get a job and make up to 200k, you'll double it for me to invest. What did you do? It's Uber. You know I figured if I stay level headed, I should be able to make something big out of it. I'm proud of you. Send your account details, I'll do the rest yeah. Boss don't worry, if I can do 200k, I'm sure I can do better than this. In fact, I heard of this HWO foundation, let me see how it goes. Sounds good, I've heard good things about it. I hear they're really empowering young entrepreneurs. I think you should take it up. Proud of you mhen. Yes Boss, with this slow and steady process, I can sleep with both eyes closed and that's the main thing. This is amazing, You're a great guy you know. You just needed perspective. Atleast something good came out of me. I don't understand Boss. Well you heard what happened to your sister because of me. Are you Truth Hurts? No man. That guy has been attacking me and everything I do. Trying to destroy me at every turn. He somehow dragged Tasha into this. He's trying to bring her down. Mad people have done everything to break his firewall but He just didn't bend to... I just Boss why didn't you tell me you're looking for Truth Hurts? Listen, Hakeem I really appreciate your offering to help but My brother this is not the regular yahoo yahoo thing. This is deep stuff mhen Security cyber stuff mhen. It's way beyond your skill set. You've forgotten it's me, Hakeem the baddest. Boss I graduated from Unilag with a 2.1 in computer science. And all these yahooing was because I was a commander in Supreme Blackhat Hacking. Boss, I'm good. - That one is small, I will find him. - You can find him? Common social media troll, I will find him. - You sure? - Smallest, Boss I will do it, in fact I have a request right now Boss. Let me call you back. - Okay. Okay Hakeem - No way, you have to be kidding me. You're the one that has been outing trolls? Yes. So what, you came after me because you thought I was Ojuju. Apparently. Listen, I understand your frustration. But given the situation then, I had to take drastic measures. So I brought on board some of the best minds in the game. And we did what they do We traced the IP Address of every troll, linked it to their email subsequently, their address. And then of course we ended up at a certain device. Now the device in question that you posses was the device Ojuju uses to troll people, especially me. But I told you that it was my cousin that gave it to me. And I believe you. Okay so what are you going to do to my cousin now? Nothing. If for anything, the fight has been drained out of me since I met you. And that's why I decided to end it. I've decided to end this operation because I found you. No really. What was that for? Because now I'm in love with you. Come here. Come on, please. Please. I love you too. Get a room guys, there's 7 of us here. One second Hilda. - You know what we need? - Yes Boss. Pizza. You got Boss. With extra cheese for the lovely lady.

Does this look like a film costume? For 2 years. 2 long years I invested in makeup and hair dos, and dresses, and facials, and fragrances. Only for me to be rewarded with words How do you repay my efforts? You fall in love with Trasha Frank Orji. [sighs deeply Frank Orji. Arrrgh, the flings! And the dates, the one night stands, the sex! The flings, the dates, the one night stands the flings, the dates, the sex! The one night stands, all very forgiveable. And understandable. Because you're a man. And every man has that gene, that gene That fuck boy gene! Frank Orji I was supposed to be your queen. I was supposed to be the one on top but you know what you did? You find some nobody, from God knows where who has the online Monica of Ojuju oh Frank Orji how, how could you stoop so low? Frank Orji It was you. Roma Roma? Roma Roma Roma Yes! Roma almost discovered who I was. He was this close so he had to go. What? Truth Hurts Truth hurts Yes Frank Orji Truth Hurts It does doesn't it? Frank Orji, the truth hurts and the truth always wins why? Well, Frank Orji. Oh why? Questions of life why Frank Orji. I came into this entertainment industry for a career. And all I kept getting offered were times in bed So up close and personal I realized and I discovered that it was all a facade it was all bullshit. Frank Orji You were good. - Fix yourself - and different and you took my opinions on board. And I was falling in love with you. And we would have been perfect together. Frank Orji, did you know how many hours of video footage I have of you Frank Orji? Ah I am not interested in Hilda like that, she's a proficient PA. You needed to be punished. Humbled, Frank Orji. You were supposed to hit rock bottom, loose everything Your friends, your career, your love, everything. And then someone was supposed to bring you right out of all that mess, not her! Me. The glory would have been all mine. All - Victory is mine, Victory is mine - What happened to them? Oh my gosh! yes, I came in and I found them on the floor. You know what I think happened I think she poisoned him and then she poisoned herself. Wait, who are you? - My friend And my brother. Boss. Yes. We got everything Good job. Baddest guy! Wait, what is going on? - What is going on is that we've been on to you from day 1. You see, when Roma slumped I knew something was happening. And of course, the hospital chalked his condition to high blood pressure. I mean he had no pre condition like that, neither did he have any family history in that state. I thought something was really amiss, so we dug deeper. I took the pack of juice Roma had and sent it to the lab and had it checked out. And it was laced with a high dose of adrenaline exactly So I decided to dig even deeper. At first I suspected my friend here After that, Hakeem and my girlfriend came into the picture. Hilda Wakama, your manager, Boss I assessed her video files This babe is the girlfriend of the devil.
