(mysterious music) - Hello, Simon. Eggs, is it? (uplifting music) (bell rings) (background chatter) ♫ She wouldn't like to be-- - Oh, Mr. James. - Oh, dear, dear, dear. (chuckles) - Splendid, splendid. Morning James. - Morning, governor. ♫ Trotters in the sweet by and by - Oh, why. Ms. Bonnie. Up, up, up. - Is she here yet? - No Miss. She wouldn't be leaving London yet. (train whistle blows) - Never brown shoes, always eat with your left hand, and cut with your right, be sure the prongs of your fork are pointed down. Oh and, watch your language, and try to avoid abstract nouns. They upset people. Say, yes, as often as possible. Oh and smile. People like it. Thank you. Right. Now. In case you get peckish. If anyone, except the guard, speaks to you, pull the communication cord. Oh, and about clothes. If people notice what your wearing, you're not well dressed, you're over dressed. (whistle blowing) Oh, and if this child. This Bonnie. Takes after her father, she'll be far too energetic to be lady like. Take no notice of her, whatsoever. - What do you mean Aunt Jane? - Never mind. Oh, and try to grow out of Annabel. - Annabel, wave goodbye. (poignant music) - Goodbye, Sylvia. (background chatter) - Hello, hello, hello. What have we here? No sense crying, on one of His Majesty's trains, my dear. They run on horse power, not water power. (train engine chugging) Name's Grimshaw. What's yours? Banana? I'm not a man who enjoys the sulks, my dear. Let's ask the banana, shall we? Does she want to eat you? Yes, or no? Y. Yes. - How did you do that? (engine chugging loudly) (whistle blows) (knock on door) (door creaks) - Hee yah! - Oh Miss Bonnie. Your tea. - High step. Will she be here soon? - Soon enough I dare say. - Tomorrow? - Aye, may be. - Take the fences! - You don't think you're too old for this game? - Never. - I might be Miss Bonnie, you might think of that. - I hope that train isn't delayed. - I wouldn't worry about the train being late, I'd worry about being late for your tea. - Go boy! Faster, faster. (whinnies) Faster. (coughs) Come on. - Look! (suspenseful music) Got ya. - You toad. You slimy slug, you. Slow down you toad. - I will not. - Slow down. Oh, sorry Mrs. Dobbs. - She's not at all sorry. - I'm going to beat you this time, I will. - You will not. - I will! Why do you have to go away? - Dr. Morne feels that you mother can not tolerate another winter here. - Why do always do what Dr. Morne says? What would you do, if he said was going to die, because you were leaving? What then? - Well then, I suppose we should have to get rid of Dr. Morne. - I'm not strong, my dear. I need to go to where the sun warms my poor bones. - Yeah, there's nothing like a sea voyage to bring the roses to your cheeks, huh? - But I'll be so lonely. - You'll have Sylvia. (wolf howls) (door bell rings) - Sylvia is here. Sylvia. - Miss Bonnie-- Look at your dress. - Sylvia, Sylvia! (foreboding music) I was expecting my cousin Sylvia. - I am Ms. Slighcarp. Where is your courtesy? Oh, I can see some lessons in deportment are in order. Again, please. This time bend low. Avert the eyes. Much better. Civilization is built on these small acts of submission to authority. Now, where are my chambers? - Mama and Papa are waiting to welcome you. - A lady, my dear, never enters polite society without a wash. Hands. (sharp inhale) A lesson I see you've yet to learn. - This way please. - My pleasure. (whistle blows) (brakes squeal) - What's happening Mr. Grimshaw? - Something across the track, my dear. - Poor Annabel, she's quiet frightened. Being stuck on a train. Still, I suppose it's an adventure. (wolves growls and snarls) (wolves howl in distance) - I do regret not coming up to London to make arrangements with you myself. I had no idea I had any relatives, other than dear Aunt Jane. - Oh, my parents spoke of your side of the family quite often. Our grandfathers it seems, had business dealings, at one time. - Well there's the thing, huh. - I do hope you and Bonnie will get on well together. - Oh, I'm sure we shall, Lady Willoughby. We shall sit in this splendid sitting room, and read the classics everyday when you're away. Shan't we Bonnie? - Everyday? - She prefers nature studies. - Then we shall do that. Children learn best, what they want to learn. - I know how to dissect a frog. - What a bright, spirited child. I shall enjoy teaching her, and Sylvia. When does she arrive? - Tomorrow morning, early. If the train isn't late. - Could I go meet her please, Papa? - Don't be silly. The wolves are as bold in the daylight as in the darkness. (engine chugging) (precocious music) - My God, it's cold. Well come along girl. - Settle. - Come along now, we best be off. - Here laddie, drink this. It'll warm the cockles. (wolves howl) Oh, that one sounds close. I hope you fella have got plenty of ammunition. - Aye, aye, we've got plenty. - [Both Coachmen] Thank you. - Oh, come on James, we'll catch our death. There's a fire inside, and tea. - Aye, and no wolves either. (scoffs) (suspenseful music) - Hurry, we mustn't be late. - Miss Bonnie! (engine chugging) - How will we stop in time? - Trains stop in stations. That's all there is to it. (engine chugging loudly) (anxious music) (brakes squeal) (wolves growl) - Bonnie? Bonnie? - Oh dear. (groans) - There she is! Go! (wolves growling) - Get on here fast. There's no time to waste. - There's a man on the floor. I had to speak to him. I couldn't pull on the communication cord. Are we to be eaten by wolves? (groans) - What happened to him? - He got knocked out by his case. - How? - He maybe needing a doctor. - Alright, lets take him home. But hurry, or we may all be needing one. - Come along now, sir. You best come with us. Carefully. Careful. - Come on. - There you go now sir. - Hurry! - Hurry along now please. (menacing music) (steam hisses) - Annabel! I've left Annabel. - Miss Sylvia. - Sylvia. Sylvia, run! (gun shot) It's wolves! Run! Hurry! Run! (gun shot) Sylvia Run!! (screams) Run Sylvia! (horse whinnies) You shouldn't have gone back like that. The wolves could have chewed us to bits. Not just you. - Me? But I wasn't going to leave Annabel. - A doll. - A friend. Friends are important. (uplifting music) - She's here. She's here. Mama, Papa. She's here. - Oh, Miss Sylvia. You finally got here. - Well, well-- - Come on, this way. Mama and Papa are waiting. - Oh, my dear fellow. Please calm yourself. He doesn't know a (mumbles) from a fox hole. My guess is amnesia. - Extraordinary Dr. Morne. - I don't like the look of him. - Nevertheless, this fellow, whoever he maybe, was very kind to Sylvia. Ms. Slighcarp. - Now, listen to me. - Please see that he is nursed back to health, and sent on his way. Make all the decisions and so forth. Or perhaps I'm asking too much-- - Your household will be quite safe in my hands. (groans) - I'm entrusting it to you. (lighthearted music) - Don't be long, Mama. - Of course not darling. Be good children, and do what Ms Slighcarp tells you. - Goodbye Sylvia, my dear. There you are. Bonnie. Keep the wolf from the door Ms. Slighcarp. - That is my function sir. - The good ship Thessaly calls. - On words. - [All] Goodbye. (background chatter) (sorrowful music) - Your so slow. Come on, don't be such a slimy slug. - I'm scared. I don't like heights. I get dizzy. - All the way round, without a foot on the floor. - I can't. - You only know a room, when you see it from the top. - Touch the ground and kill your Mama. - Oh, I'm not playing this stupid game. - Why ever not? - My mother is dead, silly. (sorrowful music) What's that light? - Oh that's just Simon. He lives in the woods. - Hello Chris. - Morning Ms. Bonnie. - Oh no, no. Playing in the snow, you've got to have a proper breakfast. - Yes, please, Mrs. Shubunkin. - Now sit down. (background chatter) Eat up. - And what pray, are you young ladies doing in the kitchen? - Having breakfast. - We'll soon see about that. Have their food taken up to the nursery, immediately. - Beg your pardon? - But I always have breakfast here when Mama-- - Up girls. If you eat in the kitchen, you will talk like the servants. - What's wrong with that? - Quite a lot. As you may soon discover. (foreboding music) - Come on Sylvia. I'll race you there. (wolf howls) - Help, the wolves, the wolves! (giggles) scaredy cat. Come on, faster. Faster. Come on, lets do it again. And this time you can ride. - No. Look, isn't that Ms. Slighcarp? (wolves howl) - It isn't safe by the park boundary. We have to go and warn her. Come on scaredy cat. - I am not. (wolves howl) - Here we go. (screams) - This is fun. Oh! Come on! - Oh wait for me. (girls chattering and laughing) (ominous music) (wolves howl) - How peculiar. I could have sworn that was Ms. Slighcarp. - Perhaps a neighbor, or a visitor come calling. - There aren't any neighbors, and we don't have visitors. - No visitors? - We have balls, and house parties, and written invitations, but not just visitors. - That's sad. I'm glad we're ordinary. - Well I'm glad we're not. - Don't lets quarrel, it unchristian. Look, there's Ms. Slighcarp. - She must have been meeting that woman. (wings flutter, crows call) - Come on. (ominous music) They can't beat us. (wolves growl and snarl) - Quick. - We'll never make it. - Of course we will. (wolves snarl) Run Sylvia. - Where are we going? - There's a track my Papa used to hunt. - Miss Bonnie, that way. Quick. (snarls) Go. Come on. Hurry up. - Where are we going? - Quick. Quick. Quick. Quick, inside. (animal noises) (inquisitive music) - What do you do in here? - He lives here stupid. - You must be a very poor person. - I choose to live here. - Why? - Don't be so rude. - But I want to know. - She's so nosy. (goat bleats) - There you are Billy. Hello Billy. - I like the winter. And the summer. I like to be close to it. And I like the animals. - But not the wolves. - And the wolves. They are, what they are. - I see. - She doesn't see a thing. - Do you like animals more than people? - More than some people. - You'll like Annabel. - Oh, no. - Annabel is my friend. - I'm your friend. Now we'll have to go soon, otherwise Ms. Slighcarp will be getting worried. You'll have to guide us Simon. - Please. - Please. - Why didn't he come all the way? - He doesn't come near the house. Except when he brings the eggs. He doesn't like grown ups. (ominous music) Look Sylvia. (chatter) Oh, Alice. Where are you going? What are you all doing? - Bonnie. We've been sacked. Not so much as a fare thee well. She's wicked, she is. - But she...she can't do that. It isn't her house. I'll make her take you back. Come back. - Oh, as much as I'd like too, my darling, it's her who pays the wadges. No wadges, no work. That's the way it goes in this cruel world. (wolves howl) - They know each other Sylvia. - They know each other very well. - You naughty, naughty girls. Where have you been? Out so long, and so late. And the wolves everywhere. How could you? How could you? Me with my heart nearly broken, thinking you was some wolf's supper. And Ms. Slighcarp saying not to worry, you'll be back soon. And me begging, begging to sound the alarm. - But why-- - But who's to hear it? Oh deary, I. Deary, I. Deary, I. - But why haven't you gone? - I'm afraid me and James is all you got left now. Let the rest go. To pocket their wadges, but me Lady couldn't do without her butler, and her maid, now could she? - My lady? - Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which were lost. Luke 6. Oh the bible. Mr. Grimshaw and I were beside ourselves with worry. We sought solace in prayer, and low, He answered us. - You didn't even send a search party. There were wolves everywhere. - How could I? The servants left, quite without warning. - 20 servants for four people, is a little extravagant. - But there's not-- - But, but, but, but. Buts are for Billy goats. In honor of your safe return, there will be no lessons tomorrow. You two will spend the entire day, in the nursery. - The servants didn't go. You made them leave. Isn't that so Pattern? - Is that all? - We're bigger, we need more energy. And you my little lady, need less. Mouth, Mr. Grimshaw. - But why are you doing this? - Yes, why? - So you'll be grateful for what you have. And you will sit there until you have finished every scrap. - I can't. I'll be sick. - Then you'll eat that, too. - Children should live upon their sick, and nothing else. Can't abide a child, who's fussy about its food. Eat up, and be thankful. That's my motto. - Oh. A letter from your parents. - My I. - This letter, is not going anywhere. But you are. To bed. Both of you. - Letitia, I think perhaps the girls should be allowed to-- - When I want your opinion, I will ask for it. Your fathers farewell letter, destroyed, by your carelessness. Well, your parents have set sail. And you're in my charge now. Go to bed. (ominous music) (wolves howl) - I am glad you're here. Don't suppose you are. I expect you wish, you were safely back at home with Aunt Jane. - But then you'd be all alone. You couldn't manage. - Could so. - Could not. - Could. (bird calls) Do you think it'll get better? - No. - Neither do I. (wolf howls) - Come on horsey. Come on. Come on horsey. Wee! Come on horsey. Wee! Come on. Careful horsey, don't fall over. Come on. Wee! That's my mother's best dress. How dare you. Take it off immediately. Why it's no better than stealing. - Everything in this house, was left of my personal disposition. - But not my mother's clothes. - It looks silly worn in the morning, anyway. That's meant for night. Aunt Jane says, if anyone notices what you're wearing your-- - Not, another word. - I hate you. (ominous music) (screams) I hate you. Ow, let go! Ow. - In there, and stay there. - Me too, me too. - A few hours in there, should calm you down. - Let me out, let me out. - And if it doesn't, there is always Blastfern. - I want my Mama. Why did she have to go away? Let me out. Why did Mama have to go? - Don't cry, I'm here. - Don't be stupid. I'm not crying. I'm laughing with joy because I had to look at her horrible face. - Is there another key? - No. I tied it to the cats tail, and it ran off. Stupid cat. (sorrowful music) - what's happening? - Oh, don't ask Miss. I can't abide this. But it's them or me. Either the toys go, or-- - She's locked Bonnie in the school room cupboard. We've got to get her out. - There's only the one key, my dear. I'm sorry, Miss Sylvia. (suspenseful music) (water splashing) (humming off key) - Bonnie, Bonnie. I've got the key. - How'd you get it? - Well, I feel very bad, but I had to steal it, Bonnie. Actually steal it, from Ms. Slighcarp. - Wasn't that a sin? - Yes, now I'll go to hell. And it's all your fault. - Well, I expect if I pray for you, you'll get off. Unless circumstances. - She's making James get rid of all the toys. - He wouldn't do that. - He is. - Right. (capricious music) - And the dogs have been disposed of. - Slighcarp. - Good. - Your dress. - Oh, how this child has been spoiled. Oh, this is much better. All these toys are to be crated up at once. And sold. And James, from now on, the children will make their own beds, and sweep this carpet, and wash their own plates, and clothes. And food, when they've earned it, should be plane. You may serve me a light luncheon directly. Oysters, game pie and champagne. The best, no half measures - Yes, mam. - James. - Yes, mam. - I'm pleased with you. - Yes, thank you mam. Anything you say, mam. (sorrowful music) Miss Bonnie. I thought you were in the cupboard. How did you escape? - James, why do have to be so helpful towards her? - It's the only way I can stay here. After all, I'm only a servant. If she finds out you've got the key. Here. I'll put it back. (suspenseful music) - You're getting better at this, and it's more difficult now. - Needs must. - What does that mean? - Needs must-- drives. Oh, dear. (stone scraps and creaks) - Goodness me. We'll need a candle. It's dark in there. - I'm not going in there. - It might be a secret passage. Oh, it's dusty. - Bonnie. - Scaredy cat, come on. - Bonnie. - Isn't this strange? - Come on, let's go back. - I wonder where it leads too? (spooky music) (floor creeks) Careful. Rotten floorboards. - [Pattern] It does not need sharpening James. - I can hear voices. - [James] I'm likely to cut the throat of that old hag. (Pattern chuckles) - [Pattern] I think we ought to be doing a blanket stitch on there. - [James] I shouldn't be doing this at all. - We're behind the kitchen. - I should be helping those two, poor, wee, bairns. I'm no stranger to danger, me. - It's James and Pattern. - I'm a woman, what can I do? - That must be the secret door. - [James] Someone has got to do something. - Come on, it's impolite to listen. - Is that what Aunt Jane says? James is such a disappointment. - [Slighcarp] They deserve to die. - Listen. - [Slighcarp] You are a masterful forger, Mr. Grimshaw. - It's Slighcarp. - And Grimshaw. - [Slighcarp] All my life I've had to live off scraps from the tables of the rich. Condescended to by people like the Willoughby's. People who made their fortune, stealing from the likes of my family. Drab clothes. Drab dwellings. Drab life. Oh yes, it'll suite me fine, to be wealthy. - These hands, can work miracles. - On paper. (chuckles) - You're hard, you are. - Very. - Oh, let's see. - No. - Isn't she a beauty? I'm calling it, Lord Willoughby's last supper. - I rather fancy the resurrection of Letitia Slighcarp. - She's sitting on his lap. - In recognition to her services to the family. And in particular their beloved daughter Bonnie. Now, the Wiloughby fortune will be mine. All, mine. - [Grimshaw] (singing off key) - They're dancing. - Oh, let's see. - Oh, oh. Don't be a pig sir. - [Grimshaw] Lie with the pigs you get fat. - And when the The Thessaly goes dark, Lord Wiloughby's insurance money will make us even fatter. - Out with the old ways, in with the new. - When their ship goes down, your ship comes in, Mr. Grimshaw. - Yes, yes. - What are they doing? - Bring her into harbor. - They've gone now, come on. (capricious music) - All the money, is to be divided between you and me. Is that fair? I'm his daughter, and you're only his niece. My father's signature. (wolf howls) Why are they trying to burn this? - Because they've put another one in it's place. And when your Papa is dead, the lawyer will open an envelope, and everything will be left to old Slighcarp, instead of us. - We've got to hide this. - In Annabel? - The doll? - We must tell someone. Pattern and James are no use. - We need to get someone with the power to help. - How can we, when there are wolves everywhere? (mournful music) - I've got an idea. First you got the help me back in the cupboard. Come on. (capricious music) - I think she's having a fit. I think she's going to die. She might, you know and then there'd be a funeral, and everybody would think, funny, last we saw, she looked really happy and healthy. What's going on, they'd think, up at Willaoughby. Funny they'd think. - I'll deal with you later, madam. I'll funny, you. (ominous music) (moans and cries) How very provoking. Even in sickness, this child is unruly. - Shouldn't she see a doctor? - Oh, um. I suppose I could send for Dr. Morne. It's quite an expense. (moaning) James. Up Mr. Grimshaw. Up. - My head, I can see double. - Oh dear, dear, dear. Oh my dear wee, lassie. - How was that? I was wonderful. I should go on stage, no matter what Mama says. - You're alright. I think you over did it. - What do you mean, I over did it? Which bits? - Miss. Bonnie. - See, he fell for it. James we want you to take a letter with you, when you go for Dr. Morne. - Lady Slighcarp, would na like that. - Of course she wouldn't like it. That's the point. Are you afraid of her? - Aye, Miss. Bonnie, I am. And so would you. - I'm not. - Liar.. - Get Loise and I'll bring you the letter. (singing quietly) - Go get the doctor aye, the poor, wee lassie. Get the doctor. That's the best thing, aye. The doctor. (wolves howl) - Dear Dr. Morne, Our governess, Miss. Slighcarp is evil. She's got rid of all the servants and-- - Slow down. - And sold all our toys. It's Grimshaw. (moaning) Oh, my poor head. (suspenseful music) - You over did it. - I did not. You'll have to go through the secret passage. (wolf howls) (scary music) (rats squeak) - Oh, no. (singing) - James. (scary music) (wolf howls) - We've done it. - Pack a small traveling valise, at once. You are going on a journey. - Where to? - You'll find out. (dreadful music) (wolves howl) - James. - Where are you taking her? - Away. - But the wolves. - I'd like to see the wolf that would tackle me. (whip cracks, horse neighs) - Damn you. (sorrowful music) (wolves howl) (thrilling music) - Blastburn. (sorrowful music) - Out. Come on. My Rupert, how you've grown. - Not much I could do about that, Slighcarp. (chuckles) - In. Stay there. Quite the little gentleman these days. - That I can attend to. - Watch them. Gertrude. - Letitia? - I've brought the little darlings. - It's a bit premature, isn't it? - They are totally unruly and ungovernable. Brisket, It's over to you. They're outside. - Right. (dramatic music) My name is Mrs. Brisket. And my word is law. From now on, you are number 98. And you are number 99. - I'm Bonnie Willoughby, and I won't be a number. And neither will you, will you Sylvia? - No. - Deal with them Rupert. And bring me their coats. - Go on. Get a move on. In here. And no talking. (train whistle sounds in the distance) - The Thessaly is not seaworthy? - Of that's for sure Letitia. - And you paid the sea captain? - Yes. - All the money? - Yes. - Then all we do is wait. - We can celebrate. - The time for celebration, is when the Willoughby's are dead. (bell rings loudly) (children chattering) (water splashing) - I'm Emma, and his name's Joey. - That's Sylvia, I'm Bonnie. What is this place? - An orphanage. Brisket gets money for keeping us, and from the laundry. - Where's Mr. Brisket? - Everywhere. - What? - Here. - Drowned him in a vat of lie, she did. One of her tempers. She made soap out of him. - Up two minutes and already late, eh? I knew you two were gonna be trouble. Take this. Put this on, and get down stairs, and hurry. (whistle blows, machines creak) - Hurry up. Well get down then. Over here. You, your in the kitchen. Go on. Over here. Kitchen. Pick up one end of it. Nice. (machine creeks and groans) - Be careful before you talk. This place is full of tattle tales. Brisket, rewards anyone who will tell on another. (whistle blows) (water sloshing) - There's no time for that in here. (whistle blows) - The will. The will. - That girl. Breaking the line, is not allowed. Separation for you. Come with me. - Ow. - I'll send a replacement. - Brisket's coming. - Alright, come on. You can do that lot. And no talking. And when you finish those, there's them. (sad music) (wolves howl) (chuckles) (glass breaks) (door thuds, key turns in lock) - You 98. 98. Get up there and un-jam it dearie, we can't wait all day now. We're loosing money. Well go on. Get a move on. This is a competitive industry. (ominous music) Go on then. (scary music) (boards creek) - Ow. - Get a move on. Go on, fix it. - How? - Use that pole. Grab the flaming chains. Come on, you gonna keep us waiting all day? Bloody useless. That'll do. Engage the power. (steam hisses and machinery creaks) (dramatic music) - [All] (scream) - Joey, no. It's too dangerous for you Joey. Hang on Sylvia. - It's going to fall. (crying) - It's alright, Sylvia. I'm here. - I'm going to die. I know I am. - You can't stay there forever, stupid. - Oh, Bonnie. - Now come to me. - I'm trying. - That's it. Close your eyes. That's it. Give me your hand. - Bonnie. (dice clatter) - Nine. Six. - I told you, to stay away from the cellar. - You told me, I'd be a wealthy man. I'm still waiting. - You'll be paid. - In kind. - When the ship goes down. - Grimshaw goes home first class. (wolf howls) - I thought you were going to get rid of that boy? - Oi, bread only. Misconduct during work. Well, got something to say? Move it. - Bonnie. - Geesh. - This is for you. (uplifting music) - Alice. (sad music) (whistle blows) (pipe creaks and groans) - [All] Help him. Joey! (children exclaiming loudly) - For god sake, help us. - Come on Joey, wake up. - You'll have to get mother, go on. - No. You. - Mother. Mother, what are you doing? Wake up. - Oh, Rupie. We're going to be so rich. - Mother, leave off. There's been an accident in the laundry. - What's happened to the machinery. - Mother, I think number 23 has drowned. Mom, it weren't my fault, honest. - I shall be glad to get shot of this place. Number 23 is one of our best workers. (children crying) - What's going on here? Well, don't gawp. Thank the merciful lord it isn't you. - But Joey's dead. - Machinery is well and truly shot to blazes. - So is he. - Rest of you lot, back to work. - You hear it, back to work. - I don't think that would be such a good idea. - Bonnie. - Oh, you don't eh? You don't? - No, I don't (growls) (children laughing) (coughs and gasps) - You. - Now, now mother. - Ow! Get this lot, back to work. - Ow, my hair. (snoring loudly) - A letter from Blastburn, mama. - At last. - Ow! Let go! - Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. The Thessaly is down among the mermaids. Your parents are dead. You're no better than the other urchins now. - Liar you're a liar. - Slighcarp will be coming. She'll make you believe it. (sad music) - We're never going to get out. - We will. We will. - It couldn't be true about Mama, and Papa. - Of course not, silly. (horse nicker) - Hey faster than a coach and six, this one. Eats coal like mince pie. - What is this place? - Wanna give us a hand? - I have come into my inheritance, and you my loyal leftenant, can join me in the lap of luxury. - Oh Letitia, yes, yes, yes. - First I suggest we rid ourselves of Bonnie and Sylvia. Their talk may complicate things. - You was right Letitia. Ungovernable. I had to shut them in the coal hole. Take Rupert, if you don't mind. - Where is the little prince? Shall we go? (key turns in lock) - Help us please. Please. - We've been kidnapped. (laughing) - Can you get us out of here? - [Both] (screaming) - You swine. - Vermin. Good grief. I'm bleeding. - Better go and have that seen to. I'll do this. - Would you? And when you've finished, I'll be in the Kings Head, I'll buy ya a pint. Now, be careful. - Go away. - Watch it. - [Both] Simon! - You will never snoop at the Chase. Or you will lose all house privileges. Understood? - Yes. - You will refer to me always as Lady Slighcarp, you will be courteous at all times, agreed? - Yes. - And you will advise me of any of your mother's peccadilloes that might adversely effect my reputation. - Yes. - Good. - Pecca, what? - Come on. Come on. - Slighcarp's forged my father's will, with Grimshaw. (screams) Sylvia? (ominous music) - Wait here. - Slighcarp. - You! - Come on. - Quick. - Hurry up. - Leave those girls alone.

It was so beautiful. We almost wanted to stay. - Mama! - Never though we'd see Willoughby Chase again. - I hope you will forgive us for our misjudgments. - Well father, you were certainly taken in by Miss. Slighcarp. - Sligh-pig. - Father, you must do something for those orphans, in that terrible place. Say you will, please. - Bonnie, I said I will, and I will. - And father, does Sylvia have to go back to London now you're back? - Well, I couldn't leave Aunt Jane, I'm all she's got. - Yes, do you think the east wing will be sufficient for her needs? (chuckles) - Well man, what have you got to say for yourself? - I am sir, your most humble, contrite, servant, my lord, sir. - You are a thieving dastardous swine. - With all respect sir, a poor, impoverished, working man, sir. I've got nothing but the clothes on my back, and the good will in me heart to survive with. I beg you as a fellow christian, to take account of my troubled life. My sincere, religious, conviction, to follow in the paths of righteousness. In the name of the Holy Mother, and the communion of Saints. - Yes, yes, yes. The constable will hear your confession. Take him away, James. And what sir, is you explanation? - It's a miracle. A miracle. (silver clattering) (joyful music)
