Subtitles by Jo High school life instantly decides everything in one fell swoop. Whether you get in a circle at first or not... That's the problem. Yes! Well, this other time my boyfriend suddenly said that he'd like to tie my wrist during sex. Did you agree? Of course not! Talk about a mood killer. -He really did so? -Seriously. -Seriously? -Yeah. Boys are dumb that's why they immediately copy what's shown in porn videos. -I so know. -Aren't I right? But mine's an adult already so he wouldn't try such kid acts. -Isn't that the end for you? -What? Is that so? Well, mine also said that we should go on a date through a drive... We would go to a hotel in Roponggi and have dinner there. Wait, where did you take these lines from? You don't think this way? Just you though! What a waste! It'd be good if you tried though. It might be hotter than you expect. What? Erika, you've already done it? Isn't your boyfriend kinda crazy? Well actually, I thought it was impossible for me, but... I did think that it was great at first and all too, but... If it was something like that, I guess you can afford to do that too. I have a call from my darling! Excuse me for a bit~ Hello, darling~? Who are you calling "darling"?! One after the other, you make me pretend as your boyfriend! You know our school prohibits phones during class. Sorry, Sanchan! I really owe you so much! Seriously, why do you have to lie about having a boyfriend? You do now that all the girls in my group have boyfriends. All they talk about is them. I told you, there's no reason for you not to tell them that you have zero experiences in love, right? But there's no way they do bondage play, right? Sorry, Sanchan! I'm sure she's just lying. Who is? Erika. I thought so too! About her boyfriend, right? Yup, you're right. I get the feeling that he doesn't exist anywhere. After all, we haven't seen his face yet. You too? I told her to let me see a photo of her boyfriend, but she said he didn't like photos so I placed it aside. I told her to let me see him but she sways away from the topic. Even the phone call a while ago... she puts on an air like it's really her darling whom she's calling. Why don't you just finally come out clean that all the talk about your boyfriend was a lie? No way. No way. No way! After all, everyone in my class were already gathered in a perfect group. There's no way I can get in another group at this rate. But why the heck did you get along with those girls in the first place? Well, there was no one around me whom I could talk to anymore. Okay, I'm not oblivious to it! The fact that I'm so stupid. But it's just like back in middle school where you weren't with me. Whichever high school life I choose won't ever fit in with me. So what are you gonna do? For the meanwhile... I think that I should look for a photo that'd make them think of him as my boyfriend... or something? Look... Isn't that guy so hot? You're right! He's ridiculously cool! He looks like a celebrity! I wanna make him my boyfriend! Oh, my God! He's so freaking hot!! I want him as a boyfriend! I really do! He's freaking cool! Which one would you pick between them? So cool! What? Erika! Wai---! Where are you going? You've got to be kidding right? Look! What is that?! What? Let's go! What are you doing?! You stupid---! And with this... ...I found my boyfriend! This might work. I DID IT! OOKAMI SHOUJO TO KURO OUJI "Wolf Girl and Black Prince" But seriously. This is your boyfriend? Isn't he a freaking hottie? It really took me through a lot of trouble just to get a picture of him! He hates being photographed. But I have a feeling like I've seen this guy somewhere. Where? Is he a model? No, no! No way! That's impossible. What? What, what? Isn't he Sata Kyoya from Class 8?! You're right! You see? Look at this! Class 8! Oh, my God! This is great! Oh, hey! Wai---! You really can't just! You guys! Cut it out! Seriously! This is not a good idea! This is seriously not a good idea! He'll really get mad at me! But knowing that there's a hottie like him at Class 8, I'm sure people are swarming to him. Of course, he has a face no one can forget! You are so right! HEY! THIS IS BAD! Kyoya-kun! Sata-kun! Where are you~? Hey! What do you need from my class? The perverted photographer girl from yesterday. Oh yeah! You're right! Yesterday! Yesterday, yes! Bye! Okay! Let's go! About yesterday! Yes, you are so right! It was yesterday! This is something about yesterday! Yesterday, yesterday. Seriously? "Darling..." What? I-I'm so sorry for suddenly doing this with you. There must be a reason for this, right? If you're fine with me, I'd be glad to hear you out. I mean, umm... I see... From what I've heard, I think I got the gist of it. I'm sorry. Fine with me. In other words... I only have to pretend as your boyfriend, right? Y-Y-You're fine with it? Yup. T-T-Thank you so much! Then... I'll have you spin three times, give me your hands and bark, okay? Ehhh? It's not "ehh"... Did you expect me to play along with this nonsense request for nothing? If I'm going to play along with your nonsensical pretentious act... You're going to have to be my dog. "M-My d-dog?" You know what? I actually like dogs. They're such cheerful creatures. If you tell them to wait, they'll wait how long it takes. No matter how cold you are to them, no matter how tears fill those black eyes, they'll do just what their master says. Those eyes of theirs are thrillingly attractive to me. Oh, but if you don't like it, it's fine any way. Forgive me for going ahead with my mouth. Miss Wolf Girl. The girl who cried wolf! We're kicking you out. "Arf!" It's too bad you're so dumb... But I think this'll be great to kill time. Kill time? I'll dote on you then. ...Poochie. Lemme play too. You can't even clear off the game! I can so...! Come on, you guys! Don't fight. Play in order, okay? Then let's do Rock, Paper, Scissors. Okay. First comes rock! Jackenpoy! Yay! Lemme play later. I see. So he was that sadistic of a guy, huh? I wouldn't think of him as such from the outside. That's how he deceives everyone around him! He's the worst swindler ever! You're saying that? But in the first place, it's something you should be grateful for! Even if he's such a sadistic black prince, he did say he'd go out with you though. I know! I am grateful! I am overwhelming grateful! But have you ever tried being told to turn around three times and bark as he said? I'm at the point of revoking myself as human! Even you had an option... I know, but... It can't be helped, though. You have no other choice. Something will turn out great either way. San-chan... don't you feel happy being released from your boyfriend? You found out, huh? GEEZZ~! Meet me in the cafeteria. Buy me a drink. Make it fast! Hey, Erika. What will you eat? I got a call from my darling. Gotta go! What's with her? Ever since she opened up to us, she's been like that. Still, why? Why would the Number one hottie in school choose Erika? What? What's wrong? You're late. You made me wait. Who do you think you are? Sorry. Hey, that's my---. What? What'd you say? I said nothing. I'm digging in. Geezz... You did that on purpose. What? Oh, it's Erika and her boyfriend! Found you! Why lunch together all of a sudden? You've never eaten lunch together. I figured we might as well, now that the secret's out. Your friends? Yes, they're in the same class as mine. Marin, Tezuka, and Nanase. The ones I keep talking to you about, right? Oh, "them?" "Them?" Oh, yes. Them. Nice to meet you. I'm Sata Kyoya. Thanks for always looking after Erika. A smooth talker~~~ The feeling of the absolute smile of a prince, huh? Such a hottie like him, huh? Makes me want to hide him too. Yup, yup. Yeah. Hey, hey~ Prince Sata~! Is it true that you love bondage play? You're asking that now? Pardon? Because Erika told us. You tie her up and all that stuff. Right? Sata-kun, even though you look like a prince on the outside... You're surprisingly a pervert, huh? Do you always do such plays? No! Umm, talking about tha---! You're right, I think I like it. Sticking a gag in that annoying mouth of yours. Tying you up so good that you can't barely move. Wanna try it? Sorry to disturb all of you while you're eating. Erika, let's go. I think it's safe over here. I'm sorry. Because of me, you became like a pervert. Heck, it doesn't matter to me. But everyone was watching. Shut up already. You are my girlfriend. You're good as shutting up and be protected by me. It's not "Sata-kun," it's "Kyoya," kay? Okay. I understand. Well, I guess you're completely in my debt now. Shinohara-san... do you think this is good already? Erika. Yes! My bad, sorry! It's fine. I picked them up already. We're going home. Oh, it's fine. I'll take them to the teacher myself. Thank you, Kusakabe-kun. Sorry for letting you do this. I'll see you tomorrow! Let's go. No way. They said it wouldn't rain today. Come on. Thanks. What? You're holding this. Hey, I'm getting wet over here so move the umbrella to my side. I'm barely being sheltered too. Oh, really? I'm just fine either way... I can drop the act anytime. Hey, lean it a bit more to my side. I got it. We're running. HEY! W-W-W-WAIT! Dogs do need proper walks too. Hey, Takeru. Hey, welcome! Where's uncle? He's out shopping. What happened to you? You're soaking wet. Is she someone you know? Something like that. Could she be your girlfriend? Uhh, no no no no! This is bad. Your girlfriend is soaking wet too. Your friend? Oh, Takeru? Way back since middle school. This is shocking... that you'd bring your girlfriend over here in my store. This guy isn't cute at all for saying the most unnecessary things, right? Well, I think that's the part which is interesting about him. You're noisy. You're working right now so go away and work. Until a proper customer comes, I'll do my job. You really can't keep your act together, huh? What? Nothing. It's just that you guys get along so well. Actually, this guy's parents are divorced and his sister and mother is living at Kobe. He lives together with his father but he's working most of the times so he's basically living alone. He still comes to this store to eat at times. Don't just nonchalantly spout the extra stuffs. Welcome. What would you like? Just order whichever you want. Take my umbrella and hurry off home. I said you're an eyesore so hurry and disappear. "Girlfriend..." But still, aren't you so masochistic? Why would you say that? My stamina wouldn't be able to keep up with that. Weren't you the one said it? That there's no other choice. Well, I did but... -I want second helpings. -Here. Why don't you just go and look for a true boyfriend so you can break up with that sadist black prince. Do you not like anyone in your class? Don't say that too lightly. If there was even one, I should already have had him in the first place. Really? There might be someone nearby you but you haven't just noticed it. Your school is different from mine which is an all-girls school and yours are co-ed. Second serve. Why don't you start looking at men with romance in mind? Romance in mind? Shinohara-san. Yes. We'd like to talk to you. We heard that you were going out with Sata-kun. Is it true? Well, yeah. Unbelievable. Why would that happen? I was just brought by the wind? Sata-kun is everyone's idol. If someone puts a hand on him... It's the rule where you have to suppress yourself to show your content. Ah, but it can't be helped, ri--- What? What are you saying? More li-- Stop it, you guys. Kamiya-kun. It's such a disgrace for you guys to gang up on a beauty. Aside from that... Three against one... Isn't that unfair? What's your problem? This doesn't concern you, Kamiya-kun. I may look like this, but I have a strong sense of justice. Hey, I think we've had enough today. You're right. Let's go. Are you okay? Um... Thank you so much. I just saw you being caught up in their troubles by chance. Bye. But that was a joke. Actually, I... ...have been interested in you since before... ...Shinohara-san. Are you free this weekend? If you are, want to go and hang out with me? Let’s meet at 1pm, Harajuku station. Hey, what's with you? This Kamiya here is the Kamiya from my class, right? Right, but give that back to me. W-What, hey---! Wai--- What?! You deleted the whole application! You can't wag your tail over another guy other than me. Don't ever get involved with Kamiya and don't go out with him this Sunday. Tail? Hey... Hey...! Tell me why. Kyoya-kun... You do know that you're not my real boyfriend so this isn't betrayal or any of those. What? Have you forgotten where you stand? You are my dog. I am your master. You have no power to refuse me. Oh, wait. Is that it? Do you want me to expose right here to everyone that I'm just your fake boyfriend? I understand. I won't go then. Great. What a good girl. Oh, there's Erika's boyfriend. Hey, Erika's boyfriend. Hey, Erika! Yahoo! Just joking! There's no way I can give up that easily. Sorry for being late. Erika, you look so cute. Really? Thank you. Look. So cute. What do you think about the character? Thanks for waiting. Looks delicious. Oh, you don't have to. The bill? -I'm sorry. -No problem. Thank you. Is it good? Yeah, delicious. You hold it like this, and take extra caution of your posture. Ready.. go! One, two, three! -Here I go? -Yup. One, two. That was amazing! Erika-chan... Did you have fun? Of course. I had so much fun. I'm glad. Hey... can I ask one thing? You and Sata-kun are dating, right? So, I'm right, huh? Aaah... What a shame. I would have been happy if I were your boyfriend. I'm going to be up against Sata-kun, and I think I have no chance in winning at all. No, no! Of course, that's... Actually... Sata-kun isn't my boyfriend. It's just that... a lot happened and I had him to pretend to be my boyfriend and.. Is that true? Yup. That's why I don't reall--- What the heck? So you aren't Sata's woman then? I actually wasted my time and money on this. If you aren't his woman, then this is pointless. Well, that's it. Just forget about everything that happened today. I see. So I guess I was right, huh? Kamiya... Your way dumber than I thought. What? Wanna go at me? No way... I actually dislike violence. Let's go, Erika. So that's what it was all about? Even all of the things you told me... ...and did to me--- all was a lie? Of course! Wait, like you fell for it too easily. I say a few nice things there and you fall for me. I was suppressing to laugh halfway through and that was problematic for me. How desperate for a man are y--- Didn't you say you disliked violence? I do, but... But this girl belongs to me. It pisses me off when you hurt her for no reason. Come on, let's go. Come on. You really don't listen, huh? Do you really wanna get fooled that much? So you already found about what Kamiya was going to do, huh? Of course, as well as that lie of yours. I told Kamiya about the lie that you were my boyfriend! Can't be helped if you did. Will Kamiya-kun keep it to himself? The hell I know! For now, I don't want you getting me involved in this nonsense, okay? Next time, I'll throw you out a window. Just when I thought I finally found some genuine love. You'd gotten yourself up in a tizzy about romance, right? "Love" you experience in that state is just self-delusion. There's no point in getting depressed over a love like that. What? Thank you... You're comforting me, right? You are so easy to read, though. What?! What's with that slack-jawed expression? You look like this, that’s why people think it’s easy to attack you. My face has nothing to do with that! I might have to train you again from square one. Sa-ta-kun! Hello from yesterday. Don't talk to me like we're close. Sata-kun... ...won't you team up with me? Let's both get some fun! If we're together... ...the girls we can gather will double up. With those options in hands, women will increase around us! That's crap. The more willing women we call out the more we enjoy. It's a man's instinct! Even I know myself. You and I are the same species. We're both special. You're just assuming that. How great. Tezuka went with her older boyfriend on a 4 days 3 nights skiing trip. Wait-- where is Marin at? Hawaii? How nice~~ I wanna go on a date too~! Oh? What is your sadistic prince doing right now? I dunno. You don't know as if you contacted him. I didn't contact him. More like I haven't received any mail from him since winter break came. Well, we were just fake dating for the benefit of others anyway, so... Could you possibly be sulking? Maybe you have gotten to like the black prince somewhere. No. No no no! No freaking way! As if I would! That man’s twisted to the core! My god! Yup, that's my next destination. Then maybe I’ll go to Okinawa? Where did Erika go? Please show us some pictures next time~ Erika, did you go somewhere? Let us see some pictures next time. SAN-CHAN~~~! What should I do~~~? I really thought you weren't coming. Since I was bored... I wanted to see my dog's face which I haven't seen in a while and tease it. Thank you. Hey... Do you feel unwell today? Why? Somehow... You haven't been honest... ...like you always do. Shut up. Aren't you gonna take a photo of us here? You're right. Seriously, what did you even come for? We're going up. -How much? -1000 yen. These ones? Okay. Thank you so much. Here's your change. Thank you so much. Here. That'll pass off as proof, right? Thank you. One more time. What's fun about taking photos of food? Hurry up and eat it. I'm digging in. This so good! Are you gonna eat too? Don't want it. I hate sweets. -What are you saying? -Sorry. Gimme some of that. -Here. -Okay. That's nice. They both love each other so much that they just can't contain it. I can only see love as a play stuff. The real thing they love isn't that itself but it's themselves who is in love, right? They only want to be seen publicly that they really love each other. They don't really love their partners. Kyoya-kun... have you ever tried going out with someone because of love? No one. Why? You're popular. The hell I know. There's no woman who has seriously affected me. They're not making themselves convenient for you? They're not convenient for me. You're the worst. Shut up. Anyway, love isn't just about accompanying someone to eat. Even without it, it doesn't bother me. I don't have to force my way to admit it. What? You're strong that why's you think that way. I'm scared to be all by myself.. I'm also scared if I'm not with someone. That's nonsense. -Bye. -Bye bye. I actually wanted to go to Disney Land... but he said we should just do so next time. Well, isn't your prince coming to get you today? You're right. I'm sorry. -See ya. -Bye bye. See ya. Oh, umm... Is Sata-kun...? If it's Sata-kun, he's resting due to a cold. Cold? Yes? I heard from Takeru about your address and I bought some snacks too. Thanks for your effort. And, umm..! What now? Well, uhh... You forced your way out even if you don't feel well just to go out with me yesterday, right? Shut up. That's not it. Kyoya-kun?! Wooaahh... You have an intense fever. Should we go to the hospital? I went. How about medicines? And what do you have for food? Your father's on a business trip, right? You heard from Takeru, huh? Just leave me. He's always been like that since we were kids. This is normal for me. I wouldn't think about anything at this rate. I don't have any thing for you to do to me. Go home. Why are you acting so tough? With the way you exploit me all the time...! I bought something to relax your head. I said just leave me! What? Are you trying to get me in your debt? That's... cold. When you are sick, you have to let someone look after you unconditionally! But you can at least let your guard down for me. I am your dog, after all. Calling yourself a dog? You're hopeless. Fruits. I wanna eat something sour. Okay. I'll go buy them for a while, okay? I’ve put some sour food in the fridge. And I’ve cooked porridge, and they’re in the pot. Please eat them, if you want to. Isn’t there too many ingredients? You're right. The fever has gone down. I told you right? That I'm okay now. Because you didn't go to school. Well, I'm glad. I'm going back home now, okay? What? Do you still feel not good? Thanks. What's with that stupid look? Well, because...! You said such startling words. Are you stupid? Even grade school students say that. Well, I know but to hear that from you... I thought you'd say I was being annoying again. You're annoying. I guessed right. But with you being compared to other girls... You didn't harbor any transparent ulterior motives. That's why I didn't mind thanking you. Just that. I think there's something wrong about you! It'd be better if I checked your temperature again. Stop acting ridiculous, stupid. Kyoya! I bought some energy drinks! Erika-chan, you came? Well, I'm going home now. And you'd better be going to school tomorrow! This is annoying but why won't you admit it already? You like the black prince, don't you? No way! No way! As if I'd fall for that sadistic guy! This other day too, I went on an errand for him to buy some croquette bread and I ran so fast... ...and even after falling and getting hurt, he said that it was expected for a dog to work hard and do it for my master. He's such a piss-off! But I think I like him... I see. Congrats. I change my mind! I don't like him at all! Isn’t it very embarrassing to just agree without any complaints at all? It can't be helped. You can't choose the person whom you wanna fall in love with. Why don't you just confess already? It might go well. And if it doesn't? I might never be able to talk to him the way I always do, you know? You are so deep in that situation, huh? But, are you fine with it? To remain as a dog to him? Your hand! Gimme your hand! If you liked dogs that much, why don't you buy one? I won't. If they die, it's hard on me. Did you have one before? It died when I was in 2nd year middle school. I see. I can't adopt another one anymore. Because right now, I already have such a big dog. I don't wanna be your dog. I don't want to be... your dog. Because I like you, Kyoya-kun. It's because I have truly fallen in love with you. That's just your misunderstanding. You've never gone out with a man before, right? But because you're doing the play-dating thing, you're starting to imagine you feel that way. Bye. W-Wait a moment! What's your answer from what I said? Answer? I said, about that one... That I like you... And also... Like a response that you like me, or what not... Beats me. I wonder... Let the time pass by while you are thinking of me. I'll be looking forward to that from now on. A monster... You monster! Can I ask one thing? What? How can you still stay in love with him after hearing such a response? As if I know! I wanna know too! What's your plan from now on? For now, I'll do whatever methods it takes for him to turn my way! As if I could lose that easily! I get what you're saying. How someone goes out with a person is his method, I know... But you can't play with the heart of a person in love. I'll beat a change of heart into that guy! Oh, uhh! That's not it, Takeru-kun! You're coming with us, right? Goddess, goddess~ Listen. I'll bring it to you one more time! If you are 100% certain that you can make me happy, I'll go along with your invitation. Well of course!~ I'll grant your dreams to the best of my capabilities! Okay, you fail! To the best of your ability is a guarantee that it's gonna suck. You're saying you're not really confident. Trying such a half-hearted pass on me, you need 100 years of work. You bore me, disappear already. That b*tch can actually talk then. Whatever. -You're just a beauty! -A sadistic one! A demon! Reika-neesan! Takeru? It's been a while! Are you off to where Kyoya is? I went to his apartment though but I forgot the key. Beauty Demon! I did call Kyoya but he's completely ignoring me! Oh? Elder sister? She's Kyoya's elder sister, Reika-san. Nice to meet you. I've been under Kyoya-kun's care. I'm Shinohara Erika. -By Kyoya? -Yes. I see. So he's pretending to be your boyfriend? Well, but right now... I'm truly in love with him. I have gotten to l-like him. So, you're trying to remove me from the picture? No, no, no! That's not it. Fine with me. This is going to be great to kill time. Another "kill-time" again? Come on, follow me already. Takeru. I'm going out with Erika. What are you looking at? Well, uhh... I think this is already our third store. Even how much I eat, I don't get fat. I-Is that so? I envy you. So? Which part of Kyoya do you like? Don't tell me... you aren't one of those stupid ones who would choose a man base on his face, right? No, no way! But, if you want me to choose which part of him I like, it's kinda complicated... I think it's just the same with the parts of him that I hate and like but... I actually like the parts of him which I hate so... How do I put this? In the end, that's where it goes huh? Why would you think that? You know what? I'll tell you directly... even if you go out with him, you won't ever be happy. He is so super self-centered and selfish. He isn't self-centered! He does have a bad mouth and he hurts people now and then, but... But for him to put up with my nonsensical request, he's really kind. And I also don't think that I would want Kyoya-kun to change. As a girl... ...as long as he will love me, I'm fine with that. "As a woman... to have him like me..." Don't you have pride in you at all? I have none. If I can have Kyoya-kun to love me... ...I'll do whatever for that. I see. If you say that much... Why don't you let me see that you're serious about him? Ready? Go! She got in another fight with her man? Things haven't been going smoothly between her and her boyfriend. Once they fight, she'd eat high-calories sweet desserts to vent her anger. Really? What now? My big sis. Was it too much for you? Having a cake battle with me. After all... You did say I should show how serious I was. Erika-chan.. You did say that Kyoya was kind, right? Yes. Do you have a phone with you? Here. This is my number. If something happens, call me. Thank you so much! Let's go. Erika... What are you doing? It's not about what she was doing, you jerk. She went through a lot just recently. Shut up. I wasn't asking you, bitch. Bitch? I-I ate a lot. You ate a lot? Yes. I just ate too much. Get a grip already. What's your problem? Don't you dare embarrass a woman in public. Hurry and pay up already. Geez... what a brat. I'm sorry. I caused you a lot of troubles. I seems to be causing you too much troub--- If you were really serious in dumping me off... Instead of doing these worthless things, deal with me face on. Erika, you have pretty bad luck, to be in the same group as Kusakabe-kun. My sympathies. But seriously, a class field trip is such a bore. How about you, Erika? Aren't you going on a date with the prince during free time? Right, of course. I envy you... I wanna go with my boyfriend too. Me too~! Isn't your boyfriend in class 4 so you're going together? You're right. So what are we gonna do? Wanna skip? Seriously? I also prefer that. Free time? Yup, for the class field trip. I thought I wanted to stroll around with you. You said something extraordinary, didn't you? I-I didn't do it on purpose. I-I just got carried away. Fine. Really? Over strolling around, I could go on a walk with my dog. Yeheey! You see, I've been thinking of a really perfect date course! You’re really becoming more and more into this act. What? It's nothing. Each group, please come up with a day itinerary. I’m in charge of guiding the group during the trip. Seems like I can’t go home together with Kyoya-kun for the meanwhile then. Sorry, Shinohara-san. It's because I have bad luck. Not the least! It isn't your fault, okay? You see, my luck isn't that good too. That's not true. It's because of me. Kusakabe-kun, so you also had this kind of look in you, huh? Because you always wore glasses while you look at people so I couldn’t notice. I'm sorry. Why? I look like a girl and it's disgusting. That's not true! You look so handsome so I'm sure you're bound to be popular. No way! For me... to be... popular... Geez! Don’t deny everything! If someone seriously told you that, don't you think it's rude? Isn't that how it is? To deny everything that person said... it just means that you don't trust him/her at all. I think so. That's why, no one will ever feel disgusted looking at you, okay? I think you should be confident and act like how you usually do. Sata-kun! For our class field trip... I asked out some girls to hang out with us for karaoke. I pass. I'll go on a different course from you. Don't tell me you're going on a date with Erika-chan, huh? Will it really be fine if I exposed it to everyone? Erika-chan's lie, that is. For a prince to be keeping up with such a facade... Seems to me that Erika-chan is having fun with some other guy. Shinohara-san... do you think doing it like this is good enough? Kusakabe-kun, you're good in drawing. That's not true for someone like me. Can I have a look? Go ahead. Can I look at this too? This is a beautiful place. You're going with Sata-kun? I heard from Tezuka-san and the rest that you are going on a date with Sata-kun during free time. I see. You were also in the same group as ours, right? "Lock Love Monument." If you go with the person you like and put on a padlock, you will always be together forever. This is great. Right? But I think Kyoya-kun dislikes stuffs like that. Why? I think he's someone who wouldn't go to cliche date courses. Even if you say you wanted to go? Impossible. It's too much of a hurdle. Really? If it's me, I would do whatever it is just to make the person I love happy. I'm sure that girl who is going to become your girlfriend... would be so happy. Kusakabe-kun? Who are you calling "Kusakabe-kun"? Kyoya-kun...! W-Were you waiting for me perh--- No way! Let's go. Did you make any arrangements with that guy? Oh, Kusakabe-kun? Yeah. There was something he wanted to buy for his friend's birthday so I recommended to him a store I knew. Ah! But it wasn't today so it's fine. Nonsense. Shouldn't people just give gifts when they feel like it? So you're the type who gives presents even if it's not a birthday. But it ain't my hobby to buy gifts for women. You're right. Well, but... If you say that you want it, I have no problems buying it for you. Like a dog's collar... for walks. Really?! I'm so happy! Are you stupid? What are you saying? After all, whatever you receive from the person you love, you'd be so happy. It's special so I would definitely cherish it. Stupid, that was a joke. What are you getting carried away for? I want to go with Kyoya-kun... ... to Venus Terrace as soon as possible. There's no Venus Terrace in the Prince's course copy though. For that, if he goes ahead and I'm not there yet, he'd hate it so I will eventually come as a surprise. It's pointless to lock padlocks with him when you're not even his girlfriend. I do know about that though... Geeezzz, San-chan! You are such a meanie! Just when I'm getting all excited about this. I'm worried about you. If something happens in that class trip, I can't come and help you, you know? Right now, over prioritizing that plan... Isn't it more important for you to confirm Kyoya's feelings at this point? Then... What if I confess and got rejected? I can't go out on a date with him anymore. I did told Marin and the rest that I am going on a date. It's because you always think of the trivial things and expect that's why you can't graduate from the fake girlfriend role. [A/N: This girl can really talk fast.] No matter how many fake beautiful memories you make with him, you won't become his real girlfriend. I know. Then, while I go shopping, I leave the store to you.. You actually draw good. When you told me that you liked yakisoba croquette, Kusakabe-kun told me a great place where they have some. Only the locals know of that shop. There's something I want to confirm. What is it? What is it about? What? You can tell me anything. If you're fine with me, I'll listen to you. What is it--- Hurry and tell me. What do you think of me? I like you, Kyoya-kun. Now that I noticed it, I've been thinking about you all the time. You're just filling every space in my head. But, Kyoya-kun... For you, I am... ...just someone you hang out with to kill time. A convenient dog. Just that. You're a problematic one. I know even without you telling me, Erika. No matter how useful she is, I couldn't stay with a girl whom I didn't like. I wasn't able to say it until now cuz I was embarrassed, but... I also think about that towards you, Erika. Really? Then, if I said I wanted to go to Venus Terrace? Venus Terrace? Of course, I'm fine with that, I'll go anywhere you wanna go. Really?! You know what, there’s a rumor that if you go there with your special someone and lock padlocks, you will be together. Until when do you want me to keep playing this act of yours? So....? You believe so easily! It was a lie! There's no way I would sweet talk to you like this! How are you going to live your life this way? You'll get taken in by a con man some--- Erika? San-chan... What's wrong? San-chan~~~! What happened? You know what? I quit being the Wolf Girl. Okay. Come here. What the heck? Everyone, gather. Let’s meet up at this area after we’re finished with looking around. Let's go. Looks fun. Let's go. Erika, hurry. Let's go. There's something I want to tell everyone! -What's wrong -What happened? I'm sorry. I and Kyoya-kun aren't dating at all. What? What did you just say? We don't get you at all. I said... When I said that I and Kyoya-kun were dating, it was all a lie. Seriously? Are you for real? You all had experiences in love and all... So, in order for me to fit in with your conversations... I had Kyoya-kun pretend for me as my boyfriend. After all, I have no experience in love... and I've never kissed someone before too. But if you guys found out about that, I thought I could no longer hang out with you. I'm afraid of being all by myself in class. I'm sorry. Erika... You really hurt us a lot. That's discouraging. Let's go, guys. A while ago, inside the bus... Shinohara-san just told everyone in front of their faces that it was a lie that you were dating her. What? Was it really a lie? What's up with you all of a sudden? It doesn't concern you. It does. I... like Shinohara-san. If it means that I get to see her smile, I'll do whatever it takes. Why don't you become her man and you both can be happy or whatever. But...! Shinohara-san... about you...! I'm not involved in that. Do what pleases you. While I was living in Kobe, the Great Hanshin earthquake occurred which was a very big incident. I was living just next to the expressway where the beams fell. The bridge beam fell so hard that it damaged the mansion and could no longer be lived in. It happened that we couldn't escape. And so for the meanwhile, we took refuge inside a car... But there’s also many people trapped and dead in the house. Listen, everyone. After this is your free time. Be back at the hotel's lobby in the given time. Okay! The caller id you’re reaching is currently unavailable. Please leave a message after the tone. Hello, Reika-san. Sorry for suddenly calling you. This is Erika. Well, I'm at Kobe right now for our class field trip. I came... I'm sorry. Even though you cheered on for me... I couldn't do my best. I'm sorry. You liar. Apologise to Kyoya, disgusting. What is the meaning of this. Stop bothering Kyoya! You liar. Are you stupid? Can’t you understand? Unbelievable. Kyoya is such poor thing. Take a picture. Say cheese! I'm glad I found you. Oohh... It is true. The croquette's here are so good. You're right. I have to thank my friend. I'm sorry. Looks like I made you accompany me. Not really. It was me who wanted to follow your plan, after all. I really thought you wanted to stroll on your own following the course we planned so well. Shinohara-san... can I ask you one thing? Which part of Sata-kun made you like him? Oh, sorry. But... even if him being your boyfriend was a lie... I know your feelings for him are truly genuine. I'm really the worst for lying like that, right? That's not true! I understand your feelings. Since I've always been alone. I wonder what made me like him, too. He's always making fun of me. He's full of himself and sarcastic. He always says the meaniest things. But I liked him, you know? I'm not mistaking it because it's the truth. Even I don't understand it well myself. Shinohara-san... Am I not good enough for you? If compared to Sata-kun, I'm not really that cool. I can't even say that I'm better off than him. But, if it's me... I will never hurt you nor make you cry. I'm sorry. Kusakabe-kun, I still... I know. I understand your feelings well. That's why you don't have to answer me now. Just, for today... Will you give me a chance to make you smile? I'll do my utmost best. Okay. Okay. Oh! That is so cute! Look! That is so cute! So cute! After all, whatever you receive from the person you love, you'd be so happy. It's special so I would definitely cherish it. Sata-kun! Let's go! Hey, Sata-kun. Where are you going? Toilet. What the heck am I doing? You really are hopeless, aren't you? What? I received a voice message from Erika-chan. I tried calling her but I can't reach her. So, what's with that? That other time, when we met, Erika-chan said that you were kind towards her. Do you know? Just how she was hurt by what you said? Did you properly take a good look at her? She's trying her best to understand you. The most important feelings... until you express them in words, it won't get conveyed. Shut up! I know that much! I came. Here. Thank you. Sorry, there was a lot of people in the supermarket. We have to hurry to Venus Terrace, right? Umm, Kusakabe-kun... Sorry... I actually... wanna go there on my own from this spot.. Even I can't help myself out. After being told such cruel words... Somewhere inside me, I still want to believe in Kyoya-kun. I think about the "what-if's". I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. I still did confess despite knowing about your feelings. Yup, it's fine. I'll go ahead to the hotel, and tell the teachers that it went great for me. Why? Didn't I tell you? I... ...want to see the happy face of the girl I love. Thank you. Answer it! You were asleep. -Am not. -I'm sure you were! -Really, you--- -Just for a bit. Where's Erika? Didn't see her. Weren't she with Kusakabe-kun? So you weren't really going out with her? Why do you look a bit happy? Hey, wait up! Do you know just how much you embarrassed me in front of the girls? Why won't you just enjoy with us? Can't you just let Kusakabe-kun handle Erika-chan? Shut up. Enjoy on your own. I said wait! Don't put an act. Take a look at this. I have 300 email addresses of girls in my phone. After just calling out to them, they'd be there in an instant. In other words, I am enjoying my life 300 times more than you are. Gathering a number of girls even if you don't like them--- they're all just a pile of trash. A pile or trash? In one among all of them... Do you have a woman who you seriously wanna protect? A woman who thinks she knows all about you more than anyone else... Do you have her? A woman who thinks that once she loses you... There's a feeling of pain in her chest.... ...do you have a woman like that? I don't think you understand that at all. Once you meet someone who really matters to you. Why? Just a while back... ...I was exactly like you. Stop messing with me. That's it. That b*stard... He erased all the numbers. He's surprisingly serious. "The Black Prince". As if he's coming. Pick up the damn phone already! There you are! Would you look at that girl? What is she doing at the garbage area? How filthy! Hey, Erika! What the heck are you doing over there?! Kyoya-kun... Why are you here? It's not "why", you stupid dog! Taking so long to pick your phone and dilly-dallying around! I lost the strap... that's why... Strap? Is that why you're searching through the garbage pile? After all... even if it's a lie or not... The times I spent with you are my most cherished memories. You really are a huge idiot. I have decided. What? I want to quit being a wolf girl. I quit. Thank you for everything you've done. Somehow... I just thought that I really want to quit. I'm so stupid, huh? It would have been better if I've done this much earlier. Without a boyfriend... Hating it more to be all alone... I lied... But... I came to seriously fall in love with you... The walks I had with you were really so fun... It was so fun that... I was fine with it even if it was all a lie. I wanted to stay beside you... I really am so sorry. Then with this, it means... ...that I don't have to play with this facade of yours, huh? I see. Did you think you could just pour some water over your master's face? That's why I said I quit! Don't get cocky on me! On your neck... If I gave you a real collar, it’ll make people judge and suspect my taste. This is proof that you are mine. Don't you ever forget that. I don't get it. I don't know what you think of me! If you won't tell me properly, I won't know! That noisy mouth of yours. I love you. We're going back. Hurry it up. What? What did you say? Did you say something? Say it one more time. I won't say it, stupid dog. Say it one more time! Come on. I won't! Just say it more more time! Don’t think of force opening your master’s mouth. We're running. Hey, wait! Say it quick! Come on, don't lag behind. Hey! Kyoya-kun, say it quickly! Subtitles by FURRITSUBS Chinese Decoder: Feli_Quck Raw Provider: Antony Knight Collaborator: Ryan Bostik
