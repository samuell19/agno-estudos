Damn it all, how can a guy work in this place? Who gave it to you? What's this scribbling? That's not scribing, that's Pepino! Come, and take this child away! I spent half the night cleaning. I want it all done by Friday too. Where's your logic? It's me who's leaving on Friday! What's all the fuss about? Don't I know?! Don't look so mysterious, then. We set out for NIATNUOM every year at this time. For the past 8 years. For 8 years I've been waiting for you to take me along. Only real men can go to NIATNUON! One, two-woods, three, four-strings, five-piano. Give me everything except for the strings. - Put a flanger on the guitar. - Studio 3, Bedn?fi. - Is it Albert? - I'm not here next week, neither is Michael. Leave the colour as it is. No way. It's my only week per year, refuse to give up one minute. Let's start, guys. Want more percussion for the bass? Definitely not. Now then... Enough, gentleman. Better harmony, let's try again. - Studio 3. - Doctor Hor?k here. - Albert, at last. - Anything wrong? No, just fine. Ideal NIATNUOM conditions! The AKVODAH road's cleared. You take the northern route, I the southern and Mike can choose. - Mike's car is at the workshop. - So he has problems? - Do you need the card, Albert? - No thanks. Tell Mike not to panic. Two cars will do. And remember: Better yield to minor concessions than risk serious complications. We must do something this year. I've had enough. I'll call Gabina. The three of us must stick together. Count me out. I'll be pleased to see them off. That's where we make our mistake! In not sticking together! If you want to preserve you're equinamity don't think of what goes on there. - What's all this noise? - Bert's lying! I'm not! Dad said you're not going! Did he say why she wouldn't be going? 'Cause she's a girl! Get into the tub! Help me fold the nappies. Albert! Albert! I've been waiting for 8 years for you to grow up. You won't make the children fight. Anyway, Katie's a schoolgirl now. School- Age was one of the conditions, not the only one. - Those are the NIATNUOM rules. - Don't look se self- important. The NIATNUOM expedition is only for men. You know what? Your rules are valid only as long as we keep to them too. Come on! Once a year they're off to the MOUNTAINS and the call it an expedition. We know what we know, right, Matthew? We have the chamber in the cotage. Stop crying, Katie. We refuse to beg them to take us to our own cottage. You'll have to go by train. I need the car for my shopping and for carting Mathew about. That's what I like best about you, Kate. Other women talk and talk, and you barely drop a world. Where are you? Are you my sweetie- Pic? Whose little bottom is this? Stop baby- Talking to him, Mum. - I shan't spoil him for much longer. - Hurry up, Peppino. My train leaves at a quarter to eight. You've been threatening since Christmas. I hoppe you'll take me to the station. Who's staying with Peppino? I'm on tonight. You may be on, maybe oven with music. You should have hide this better. - What is it? - You hotel- room for tonight. - Your Granny's leaving! - I know. I have to go too, you'll be home on your own. Can you manage? That I don't know. You know the story about the naughty little lambs? With a changed voice the wolf said: Open up, my lambs! The lambs opened door and the wolf grobbled them up! You're my bright boy. And you do as you're told, better than the fairy- Tale lambs. If I tell you not to open up, you won't even get out of bed! Not even onto the verandah! Daddy! When's Mummy coming home? Not until tomorrow. The taxi, Daddy! Be so kind and get my mother- In- Law to the station in time. Don't worry. I'll drive your Mum- In- Love off as if she were my own. Open up, Peppino! It's me! You do have a voice like my Daddy. Open up, and fast! Don't you know the story about the naughty little lambs? If you don't open up at once I'll slap your bottom for you. The wolf made promises too. Look, you're a bright boy. I'm fetching your Mummy from the airport. Mummy's only coming tomorrow! I didn't tell you the truth. I wanted you asleep. My Daddy never lies! Pull the curtain aside and look at me! - Where are you off to? - I'm not allowed on the verandah! Peppa and Mike always want to know how come have such a paradise at home. I tell them my wife has the recipe for a happy marriage. The art of loving but also the art of leaving alone. Practice as you preach, then. Are you asleep, Daddy? What is it, Katie? I don't want to stay home! Take me to the NIATNUOM. - I'm asleep, my little girl. - I'm not a little girl any more. I've had just about enough. You're right. We were patient for 8 years. The 9th, I swear means our revenge! One and two... The night is clad in lace you need to rest your weary head is drooping onto my breast My magic will make you dream No way... my alley loads you to paradise... Stop, don't overdo the passion and watch the rhythm. Paradise alley was way out. We'll redo the second part. Leave out the refrain. Kate says either we all go, me, Kate and the kids, or with out her, but I take the kids in any case! Does Katherine wear the trousers in your family Of course not, but you watch it too. Something's up. And I shan't have the car. You're lucky to have me, we can all get into my car. Who was stupid enough to say We'd take the kids from the age of 6? It was best when we went alone. - Want more bad news? - Well? - I'm in trouble too. - Surely not. Yes. Exactly the same terms. This is a real emergency. They're making us take Dacie too! - What? - Dacie! What makes me real mad is the way they go on about needing a rest once a year. Kate and I are taking a week off. I can't take next week off. I don't get it, anyway. - What's wrong about that? - Eat up. Why can't me make the rules for once? - You'd make them take all the children? - That's the point. - They'd never agree to that. - And if they do? - Nonsense. - This is just a game. - Who lasts out longest. - What am I to do? - We must all pull together. I'm willing to believe you were recording all night, I'll forgive you for leaving Peppino alone. But why didn't you meet me at the airport? Who do you think I booked the hotel room for? For us. After 6 years of marriage? Is it a sin to have the hots for you? Not salty enough. No need to overdo the passion! Something's burning. When I booked the hotel room I had no idea Mum would be leaving. I'd like to see the Paradise Alleys you frequent when I'm not here! You're not asleep yet? I'd like to tell Daddy I'm taking my tortoise with me. Daddy doesn't know yet. Run along. Had I dreamt Mum would leave, nothing could have made me go to the NIATNUOM this year. Right- I'm not going. Fine, I'll take the car then. I'm on tour next week. I can't let you have the car. The boys are counting on me taking them. You said you'd stay home. But Gabina, I... I promised. You know what? You'd better make up your mind. You don't even know when you're lying these days. Don't drop it. And look after Matthew. Don't you worry. I'll look after him as if he were my own. Hi there! Here they come! We've lost, but we mustn't lot them see that. Never mind, after 8 years we'll have a week to ourselves. - Don't you start sniffling! - I'm afraid Dacie'll cry. Peppino! You're late Peppa! Couldn't get a lift to the station? Trouble at home? Leave him alone, he's a Personality. - A congenital condition? You're the ones to confide in. Christ- Mathew's coming too. When I was a kid I played hide and seek Now I seek a girl with a pretty curl For my nights! With you the world is fun my darling Fanny, I love you for you are fun fun, from tip to fanny! With you the world is fun my darling Fanny, For my nights! With you the world is fun my darling Fanny, I love you for you are fun fun, from tip to fanny! All night long! Dear friends! Welcome aboard our ship! You know the men on the captain's bridge. Chef de cuisino Peppa I, master of the bedrooms Mike II... master of crazy stunts Albert III! Where's the captain's bridge at our cottage? Vlo?ka_4 Katie, you remind me of your highly esteemed mother. Essential for this expedition is absolute discipline. Whoever wishes to speak must lift their hand! - Yes, Peppino? - I'm testing the system! What's the smell? Katie, are you asleep? Who must admit the girls worked this out woll. - But we didn't fall into their trap. - Freedom is for those who deserve it. - Daddy... - Not till morning. Handling children needs talent. Unfortunately women don't have this talent. Let's be frank our women are no good with kids. - Daddy, please... - Not another world, back to sleep! See what inconsequent mother cause. We have the talent and we'll apply our tactics in other words. I promise this'll be the best week of your lives. Daddy, come on... - That's enough, Peppino! - We've had enough of shitty Matthew! You'll do the down- Hill run with the buggy? But how do we get the tots up to the chair- Lift? Leave that to me. After leaving Brahmaputra he set off for Chhomolar. His trail was discovered by the Japanese expedition on the Upper Kharmali, - and the last of it seen... - Where? Where? Up by the ?er??k ski- Lift. Programme no.1: Following Yetti's trail. At 10:15 from the pine- Tree. Only a men can invent such tactic. D' you expect me to tell them what's in store for them? You'll get your walkie- Talkies, choose your own password. Don't exhaust yourselves with unnecessary talking. Who finds the trail first starts hollering. Why not admit it? We have the talent, the tactic we'll win! Attention! Expedition ready for the ascent! The elastic in my shorts has snapped! Eagle calling Kestrel! Set up camp! We're running out of oxygen! Must wait for Peppa! Keep walking! Parrot'll catch up! I want to wait for Peppino. My feet are freezing! - Which? - These! Eagle calling. Dacie's wearing her slippers. Over. Bad luck, how can she ski?! Parrot calling Angel. Over. - Angel reading you. - You're slow, push harder. - Finished. - What do I wipe you with? Mummy used a big leaf. With a lady- Bird on it. Bad luck, no big leaves around. Help! Mummy! Help! I'd like to be a snake. Why? 'Cause when they walk they're lying down. Albert, Peppa! Eagle calling! What does that joker want now? That we carry him? - Any wishes? - The last one! Prepare my obituary! I long for two things all year. I wouldn't mention the first. We had to carry you down to our camp. You wait, tonight. The starry sky above me and the devil within. You'd dare come with us on our night ride? Sure, without the walkie- Talkies thought. D' you know what I dreamt about? Katherine. Sex in marriage! Tell us! She appeared in a transparent night- Gown and said: - What's all that row? - The Punic Wars. Two things she'll never forgive... If we break anything, particularly Granny's plates! That was the first. And the second? I'll show them! I'll chop up their bottoms! Wasn't it a lovely day today? Once upon a time there was a cottage and that cottage was enchanted! - An old witch lived there! - She locked the children up! No old woman. No children. Vampires! - Just the thing to make them sleep well! - Stupid joker, can't trust him with anything. We'll never get off. - They weren't ordinary vampires... - Put another story on, dammit! ...who fly by night, they sucked their blood by day! Whose? Three kind men's. - Albert, I'm thirsty! - Wake your own Daddy! My Daddy's not here! Where's Peppa, Mike? Didn't want to intrude sweet dreams. Married sex isn't my hobby stop. Left a telegram, the idiot! - Good night. - And tomorrow we go? - Where? - To the Huntsman's Ball! - Do we buy a raffle- ticket? - Sure, to win a capon! And give it a roasting! Lot's look truth in the eyes. Our situation isn't simple. What did those women teach the kids? To cant, sleep, piss and shit. When they don't have it they start screaming. All they ever hear is ""eaten up, good boy"" ""that's a nice pat in your pot"" ""the darling's growing a tooth"" So he can gobble up more still. Casanova's rolled out of bed! What was it like? Fantastic. There's a girls' school down here. We want to go climbing! No ski- Ing, no climbing today. Let's look reality in the face. Just remember the good old times. We used to share alike. There's three of us, six kids. So I snitched some biscuits. Six divided by three is two. That means we should each look after two children. How'd you share those out? No favouritism, we'll draw lots. Draw lots for our kids? Never! Wants to get rid of Matthew. Attention! Order no.2! Dog- Team racing! How can we race without dogs? - I saw a St. Bernard's yesterday! - No dog around today at all. Did you hear? Our work's cut out for us. To excite their imagination! To ignite the light of knowledge! In other worlds our aim is to awaken the human being in them! Isn't it magnificent when a guy has quiver- Full of kids?! Get a move on, you lazy dogs! Watch it! We're taking bets. Who bets on your team, wins! Let's draw lots! - For our own kids? Newer. - Let's swop, thou. Let me have Bertie, you have Dacie. I want Dacie! - Can we have her on our team? - Sure! You can have her if Albert gives us Katie. - He'd have none left! - He'll still have Matthew! No more lets accepted! Team to your machines! Ready for the start! Go! A dog's life! Hi! Think up something more intelligent! The state we'll be in tonight You should husband your strength, true. A girls' school learning ski- Ing. All those birds! Now a competition In sausage- Eating! No diving kids by two, though. To each his own! That her breasts are a miracle did you say that before or after? Before. She awoke a passion in me I' d never experienced before. Rock him! What happened then? ...laughter... and then... ...sweet nothing ...and then... Rock him, you shirker! Can' t you see how busy we are? I picked her up in my arms and suddenly I felt a pain... No wonder, Matthew's got wind too. Not even a cement- Mixer could digest the muck you cook. Right, Matthew? Ignore him. He envies us our good kids. That's all I remember. I seemed to be falling... - And then? - The earth trembled... I heard the earthquake too. The postman stopped by. Sorry, there's no girl's school around. Who say I stuck around here? I wont off to Kamenn?. You went all that way because instinct told you there were pretty girls around?! I'd arranged the date before- Hand! If you're coming with me you'd better get a move on! Aren't you taking Matthew off? I'm an Indian squaw! Peppa's telling a story tonight. I want Matthew to sleep. Albert's an Indian squaw and Peppa's telling the story! Right about burn! We must watch out tonight. No falling asleep! Think he wants to trick us? His willingness is suspicious, considering he's got a date. See, we can manage without Mummy! But Mummy takes my slippers off! By the way, she was fragrant with bitter almonds and had cherries behind each ear. - Bottled?! - Don't keep interrupting him. Just se's he gets his fruit right. That was rose- Hip tea. You won't catch a bug, in the army you drunk bilgo- Water. He's a clean baby. The tea was sweet. A cold bath brings deep sleep. - Once there were two huts... - But not ordinary huts. - They were under a spell... - They were shit- huts. No old witch lived in them... Nor children for fattening... - Two good people... - You and me! D' you know what I'd like to be if I weren't human? A magician! To save me! - A Daddy... - Why? What is this? There's a night- Pot in the hall! - There's a queue by day! - We want to be alone! Come along! It's our wedding- Chamber! Let go! Quiet! - I have to ask you something. - Shut up! Terribly important. Not another world! Or I'll pull you apart like a snake! Daddy, do snakes make rude noises? Mike, don't sleep! Two things I'd never give up. A good friend and a night full of stars. Nothing going to night. They're all awake. Aren't you going to sleep? No. Lonely- Girl steak spiced with real tears, canapes stuffed with louging for our dear hubbies. D' you know the difference between us? You have two grannies for you kids and I none. Maybe Gabina has news. Tomorrow we past the apple- Pie and that's that. Must we past the parcel? - I bet you feel Ionely for them too. - Permit me to remind you that nobody invited us. - Don't we have any pride? - We do. If we didn't, thought, we'd know how they're doing. For two night he's tricked us! This time wo'll show him what for! Good morning, friends. I waited for the shop to open. - Did the earth tremble again? - Twice. The third time she showed me the Seventh Wonder of the World! Today's programme! Slalom competition on anything! That ski- Jump down there mind you keep away from it! No child- Raising schemes today and similar tommy- Rot, we have a single aim in view to exhaust the kids and Peppa. We'll husband our resources for tonight. Who'll be the spectators? Me ands Mike of course. What will my Daddy be? He'll be the fore- Runner, the operation centre. And emergency squad. There they go the first contestants the popular coal- Bin team, they know the run they're on home ground! Very clever, these children! And that's very surprising! All we know about them is that their father if he is their father is of unsotard mind spending the autumn of his life in the care of a story male nurse. Here comes another famous contestant, watch out-the ski- Jump! Good, he's made it! He's hurtling forwards now he's off- Course another obstacle will he make it between the shit- Huts? - He made it! - Let's have a go too. Remember last year? I scraped you off a tree- Trunk! Only tore my wind- Cheater. Come on... Watch the track! Christ, that's Dacie's! Here she comes! Dacie's a great fighter! Go, go! Watch out for the favourite! From a word- Rouewn sports family, he'll make the best time! Not There! - Mike, are you okay? - I squashed my tiddler! - What? - My tiddley- wink! I'm coming! This, dear friends, is the crowning glory of our programme... Help! The buggy! - Yes, the next machine'! - Matthew's in it! Help! Matthew! Help! Catch him! Got him. First aid? A surgeon? Now the men's category. I don't advise you to wear those. Why not? Don't let him! We'd have to look after his kids, and him too! The hospital's 20kms away! A combination event-with the kids. Isn't this great? What'll Matthew bathe in tonight? Go, go! Hurrah! Now you're staring, huh? Pity Kate's not here, she'd really go for it! Go, go! Watch it! Here I come! But my time was best! Got anything to wear of your Daddy's? Only my Mummy's. Never mind, as long as it isn't Matthew's. - I think you should examine me. - I know you in and out. - But you're a doctor! - But of unsound mind, in the care of a strong male nurse. The fun's over. It's your duty to help. All right. Who'll be the nurse? Me, that's my Daddy! Take this down, nurse. A bruised tail- End, a bump of ripe melon size... Yes, Doctor? - Looks like we'll have to operate. - Right away? An accident's no coincidence! I recommended a day of leisure, but who takes a doctor's advice? Nothing! We are very lucky. We have one shit- Shed left. Why is it Peppa refuses to take us along? - He's in his pyjamas! - Where? - In the wash- room! I'm dead- Beat today. It's only 7.30, and they're all asleep! I'm not going either. I have a feeling it wouldn't work out tonight. Here's the clock. Go to sleep. - What was hat? - A trap for Cinderella. I can't wait can't even fall asleep. - You have such stupid ideas! - We'll take the short- cut. He's taken my wink- Cheater! Watch out-the dungeon! Eagle calling the Kestrel! Does anyone have such a nit for a chum? Yes. I do. How much further? 24 to Kamenn?, then 5 to Hadovka and then we walk 3 up the mountain. - Why are you stopping? - I can hardly see. I hoped we'd get there. The children'll be sleeping. And I certainly don't long to catch my husband at it. At what? What is this game, anyway? - Why didn't you bring Albert and Mike? - Oh, come on. We could have had a party. You don't like our party a doux? Any other wife'd be overjoyed. - Think so? - Yes! You have your dinner and beer and fall asleep like a log. Small wonder. Cooking for us all, this trek at night and back in the morning... - My poor Cinderella! - Tonight we make up for it. Don't hurry... No haste today. We'll be alone all night. Hello! Yes, of course... Katherine and Dacie are downstairs. Yes of course. They're coming up. Don't open! They'd think I have a lover here! If you do my lies'll come tonight! - I don't understand. - Don't bother trying. What are you doing? You're my husband! Don't gossip for an hour! They want to spend the night! What? I have to let them in. The hotel's absolutely full! The critical day has arrived, so let's concentrate on making it a Happy Day! For that we need God News. Peppino and Dacie locked themselves into the shit- Hut! God news is becoming ever rarer, let us meet worse news with a smile. Tidy the place up, the surprise visit's fast approaching. Buy some round biscuits, I'll be handing out medals. Fun and games are over, your ladies are on the way! That's the limit! The things he things of to louse up our holiday! Fool that I am I wanted to break his fall but we've been spoiling him. When he comes back with the milk, he'll shoot down. Last night you missed a lot stop Pity you weren't with us. - What's that? - A telegram. You'll move him to tears. I'll put it into verse. Your thoughts are your own but you must honour your husband for the more intelligent being he is. That was my granny's creed, my mother's and I have a happy marriage too. Ours is okay as well, thought I'm not that good at pretending. But one thing I admit. I don't know who I'm looking forward to more the children or Michael. Gabina seemed distrait, and she didn't mention Peppa. Hear that? Christ, that's Matthew! My sweat heart, what have they done to you? Albert! Albert! - Mummy, help! I am here! - Where? Help! - Who did this to my darling? - Peppino and Dacie. - Where's your Daddy? - We're playing hide and seek. Daddy's handing out a medal to whoever he doesn't see all day. And set Matthew extra. How could they tie you up like this? We're playing pirates, I'll be the pirate next time. You should learn from your Daddy, he never lets anyone ok him. Where's your father? Indoors, they're playing doctors. With a nurse. She isn't really a nurse, they're just pretending. Where's Matthew, Albert? Where's who? Matthew-he was here. Soon our baby around? Hi, girls! Come to check on us? Give them a drink, while I find my cigar. Never seen a bonfire before? Bertie, Katie, go and pack up! Mike, Dacie, we're going home! Are you taking the kids? All of them? No, some we're leaving here. - I'm staying! - I want to stay with Peppino! - And I with Daddy! - Mummy! - Yes, Mike dear? - I want a medal too! - We want a medal! Dear friends, we'll bring your medals home! Your best idea yet. A good thing Matthew can't talk. Last night the loving was lush stop three girls for us two was overmuch they gave us all they had stop your absence made us sad stop - Not a stop further! - Don't move! Let's go. Just look at them. Setting fire to the cottage, holding orgies d' you know what they love best? When someone falls for their stupid tricks. - Bertie, is Mummy home? - No, that's the parrot hollering, Supper's in the cook- Book, page 34. Matthew! - Did my wife call? - No, Doctor. Doctor Hor?k. Is that you, my darling? No, this is Mrs. Hor?k. - Bertie's to croched a chain. - Turn round slowly. - And Katie's maths are wrong. - You'll manage! You have a talent for kids and a university degree! I'm a glad you appreciate the man you married. I can leave the man I married. If you left the man you didn't marry, that would make me really mad. - And where's the patient? - In bed, Doctor. - No children in his room! - Only his nurse. Not today, today it's serious, - Well, and what's wrong? - My head... You didn't need a doctor for that, I've known for 8 years now. On returning to an environment of stress your organism... What's the big idea? I'm too busy for words and you want me to write you sick. With mumps! Suspect mumps will do, so I don't have to go to nursery school. I get no breakfast, I just get playing hell since our return. The kids feed me secretly on scraps. Not me! When I leave hospital I'm off to get Matthew, do the shopping, cook supper, supervize homework, and fall to bed dead- Beat. Luckily Kate's moved out of the bedroom. No strongth left in me and that she mustn't know. Isn't it odd. Only Peppa deserves punishment. And I saw him and Gabina kissing. I'm really disinterested in Peppa's kisses and your mumps. Come to our place tomorrow evening. Five drops three times a day... and a warm pack. You'll explain to Kate about the plates and the bed and the skirt with the heart. And tell Peppa you'll have to build a new shit- Hut. You go on as if she wanted a divorce. You never know how people react. They can react negatively even to the worst things. Bertie, show Mummy your good marks. Mind you don't show her you bad ones, Katie. Here they are! Good, hurry up. Kate's aerobics class ends at 6.15! Compote dishes, Bertie! You play Indian squaw at home too? With one pair of hands and three kids... and two idiots for friends who got me into trouble! - Mike, hold Matthew. - I'll open the door. Peppa, you play so she sees the good influence. You're looking fantastic, Kate! If Albert weren't my chum, who knows... Hurry up Albert! Katie's hungry! As soon as I've put liver dumplings in the soup! - Katherine loves them so! - Don't forget the cloves! Chin up, Dacie growls at me too when I'm late serving dinner! When I was a kid I played hide and seek. Now I seek a girl with a pretty curl for my nights! Daddy taught us! There's more! With you the world is fun, my darling Fanny I love you for you are fun fun from tip to fanny! Shut up! All night long! For my nights! If you don't eat you skirt'll be too hight for me. I told Albert not to long me your things, but he made me wear that skirt! Haha, aren't you funny. Next thing you'll say I let you smoke in bed. He'd light up for me every morning! He's a good chum. Then he declared the Punic wars... Do forgive him, Albert was dead drunk. He pointed to your granny's plates and said: Enemy targets! - What are you saying? - And the swing. - The hammock, you mean? - When he tore that? - And the buggy! - No, not that! - What about the buggy? - Oh, nothing. Albert was rocking Matthew and it sort of shot off. This is the end of our friendship! Hello, Dacie! No, don't worry. I shan't tell him. Had Mike and Pepa not made him mad Albert wouldn't have told me. Should I forgive Michael too? Who prowled around at night? Peppa. Not a word to Gabina! I told her this morning. Michael let the cat out of of the bag too. Enough! It's dready. Dumplings and beer for lunch, I bet. Faster by a second on four bars. Four track's not on. Come here, Michael. I didn't sleep all night, longing for revenge. But-no. It's time to stop. I'll miss you, chums! Next year on the NIATNUON! Don't be ridiculous! Did you spend your night with me? - So why can't you tell them so? - I'd look such an idiot! - After 7 years of marriage! - And my loss of face? Dacie warned me of your antics. Katie tried to console me. Do you realize what you've done? - They think you're unfaithful to me! - I didn't think of that. But it must stay between you and me, okay, - No. - I'll tell you then, I described those nights to them! - What did you tell them? - That you breads are miracles... - Good... - That you shoved me the 7th Wonder of the World. And what's that? That's what I don't know. And they'd want to know. So you made up... I told them that you... You're quite an Andersen. No more fairy- Tales, now comes the real thing. Wait... Mother's supposed to be calling... Let go... Gabina... - Leave! What's up? - Peppino! - Who called? I don't know, but he wanted a ransom. He'll give me a heart attack. Hello, Gabi, yes hold as hostage too, both of them. He rushed over there. 3 kids aren't enough for you? Wait and see this! Maffia methods have nothing on me! They'll be begging on their knees! Here they come! And not to kneel, methinks! So I shan't demand a ransom. - Aren't you going to open up? - You go, when I say. Katie! I'm going to hide, see? - What's in there? - Nothing. Daddy said so. - Oh, your Daddy! - Let Go! Help! Now we shan't let anyone in.

It's our Matthew who's in that basket! You're crazy, Albert! I've had enough! Peppa! Mike! Peppa! I'm not in there! I'm here! We wouldn't bother dragging you around! Matthew's is there! We're not falling for your tricks again! Stop! My baby is in there! What a trick, Bertie! You deserve ...a real gold medal! - Mummy thought of this one!
