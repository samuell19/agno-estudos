Are you going to the parade on 14th July? Yes, yes. And you? No, we're going on holiday. Why? Because my father told me there will be a war. Eva. Is papa angry? No, why? Marie, don't forget the knives. On July 14, 1939, Marie had just turned 12. As every year, she was about to go on summer holiday with her parents. She would live the sweet life of summer and of her grandmother who was waiting for them in her father's home province in central France, the land of extinct volcanoes, according to her grandmother. Jean, Marie's father, had gone to work in Paris with one dream: to return to his village after making his fortune, and rekindle his childhood friendships with those who had chosen to stay in the countryside. Marie was always impatient to get there. As usual they took the bus, which drove slowly on the back roads and honked to announce its arrival. Marie loved the region. She knew well the church bell tower, standing over the village's only street, that led to the river. As usual, her grandmother was expecting them, strict and gentle, watchful and knowing. Marie would find Jeannot and Jacquot, the boys who play in the fields, Charlotte making faces, Susan, her summer friend, who wove garlands, Augusta, the witch with painted lips, and Maurice, the poacher who caught rabbits with his bare hands. Jules and his donkey, his best friend, and his wife, Rose, proud of her ever-swollen belly, André the carpenter, who made her a surprise every year, Violette the flirt, Violette! Louise, the kindhearted farmer, who served the milk so generously every evening, her beautiful daughter, Thérèse, loyal girlfriend of Fred, father of her child. Grandma would explain the strange grown-up logic that rejected Thérèse and Fred's love child, condemning it as a bastard, as one says. War was approaching, but talk in the village was about Romain the blacksmith's illness, the summer fair, and, of course, the bastard. - The bus! - It's all ready. Mrs. Farjat. They're here. I'm finished. André! André, did you make my clogs? You're even prettier than last year. Prettier than anyone you know? I'll get it. Your grandma's waiting. Pass me that. Come and have a drink with us later, André. No problem, we'll toast your holiday. - We have what it takes. - Come on! Grandma! Grandma! You've got bigger. Such pretty hair! Hello. You'll need a nap. Hello, Eva, not too tired? Let's go in. - Jean's attractive. - Silly! André, I need to talk to you. Come on, then. What is it? - My clogs? - Wait a minute. Here, doctor, I got your medicine. - It is expensive. - Did you have enough? - Yes, here's your change. - Thanks. Who's that doctor? Dr. Despiau's replacement, from Paris. He's good. Not all Jews are bad. Your grandmother's looking for you. It's the wrong colour, André. Leave it to me, Madame. Not "Madame". It's "Miss." So, my clogs? - I made them. - You made them? Romain, I got the new injectable vials for your pain. Thank you. Romain's not doing well. If he hadn't stopped Fred from marrying Thérèse... - One less bastard. - Here, André. To our Parisian friend and his beautiful Dutch wife. Who's that fellow? The doctor who's replacing old Despiau. Little know-it-all! - Now it's time for lunch. - Yes. Enjoy your meal. What are you having for dinner? I'm making one of my mushroom fricassées... Bye, doctor! - How was lunch? - Delicious, Mrs. Farjat. What a feast! Now I need a walk. Good idea. Have a nice walk. - Who is that? - You have to know everything! He's the Inspector of completed works. And she... she's hot to trot. You can't finish? Marie, don't play with the newspaper. - Do you like your present? - Oh, yes. I like it very much. Now my present's going to bed. You should too. - No, I'll wait for you. - Do as she says. Go to bed. Because... the straw's cold, the lice are hungry, the fleas are thirsty. In bed, the straw's cold, the lice are hungry, the fleas are thirsty... I created a little monkey. Come on! There's a family resemblance... So, my son, how are things in Paris? I'm sorry I haven't sent money since papa died. Come on, you have your family. As you know, I'm alone now. I don't have any needs. And I have my health. How are you? Just running the butcher shop. Don't drink too much. I get up at 4 and go to La Villette, then at 3 to Les Halles for the afternoon. Doesn't Eva get lonely? - Doesn't she miss her family? - Holland's not that far. - Do you think the war's coming? - Oh yes. That's all we need. Marie's going to be a beauty. That's for sure. I almost forgot: Rose is pregnant again. Fancy that! - Go to bed! - I'm not tired. There's no straw, no lice, no fleas. - I'm going to eat you up! - No! Mother! I'll catch you! - Sweep the patio. - That's what I'm doing. When I'm finished, I'll work in the garden. - Marie, we're waiting! - I'm coming! No, honey, you must eat first. Hi, Grandma! - Hi, Galette! - Hi, Marie! A girl needs to eat. - You're skinny enough. - Hi, Mélanie! - Hi, honey. - Don't run on an empty stomach. Don't disappear on us already! Hi, Charlotte. Look at Rose. She drops children like a rabbit. - Mostly girls. - Yes. Wait here, François. - Hello, Susan, - Hello, Louise. Hello! I brought your goat cheese, Catherine, - On holiday, Marie? - Yes, Louise. Thank Heavens you're here. I'm in pain again. Marie, go and get the holy water Yes, Grandma. I'll be down in a minute. Hurry! He's a good doctor. He relieves poor Romain's pain. Grandma, what's a bastard? If anyone asks, say you don't know. Marie from Paris pees her bed... Come on! What a zoo! Settle down! - Can I see my clogs? - Sure, Miss. Don't move. I'll have to adjust them. - You have nice, small feet. - Like aristocrats, apparently. Apparently? I've seen them and I know... She knows everything. Be quiet! Stop horsing around! - I have a secret. - None of your business! - André! - Where are you going? Find out. Look, I'm a bird! I'm flying! I'm flying away! I'm a bird! Leave me alone! - No touching! - Who cares? Let me go! - Armand will punch you out! - I'm so scared! Piss off! Let's go piss. Yeah! You are going to piss. - What's the target? - The post. - No, the harness. - Mine's the wall. Come watch. - Mine's bigger. - You wish! - Look at them. - They're disgusting. Let's play. - Marie's a tomboy. - Better than a goof. You know what I'm saying. Shit, shit shit. Get out! - I'm sick of them. - They're weaklings, not men. You're right. - Don't tell anyone, all right? - I swear. I have a boyfriend, Augusta's son. - The witch? - No, she's a lace-maker. Do you have one? - I'm waiting for him. - Who? - Haven't decided yet. - Last year I stuffed my bra. - But you don't have hair. - Yes, under my arms. My mother has lots. Periods! What a drag! Come off it! Watch you don't get pregnant. Marie! Coming! You've made a mess of my barn! Let's take a look. - You're giving me goosebumps! - No kiss? Hello. Thérèse has got her mother's looks. Our mechanic's a lucky man! Come home! - Ah, Marie... enjoying your holiday? - Yes, Jules. Have you seen Charlotte? Hello, doctor. He's nice. Thérèse! - How are you? - Fine. - Coming for the milk? - And to see your bastard. Still here? - Go, Poulette! - Get up! Mother! October 3, 1935, Mussolini occupies Ethiopia. That April, he swallows Albania on a Good Friday. - Hi, Mr. Jardin. - Hi, little girl. Hi, Fred. My bike? And so... Hitler and Mussolini, in March '38, enter Austria. Isn't the Pact of Steel grand? Since May 22, the two rogues, hand in hand, wreak carnage and murder thousands of innocent people. Isn't it grand? I ran into Thérèse. I'm going to see her bastard. See you later. That you, Fred? - What are you doing? - You're spying on me? I'm doing this. What's he doing? Your husband's being an idiot, Mélanie, as usual. Time to eat, lovebirds. Where love exists, roses grow out of dung. Mélanie, serve the guests. This French surgeon will rally national sentiment against the Germans and become a king in Avignon. - A king now! - That's all we need. After a full day, Marie headed to Louise's farm to get the milk, and see Thérèse's baby. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. The scenery was lovely, her bike went well, and she could meet her friends. André! Go, Marie! It's a lovely day! Again that year, the Archangel Michael slew the dragon, good always triumphed over evil, and the forest was still a hiding-place for lovers. Put your jacket back on. Thanks. I feel much better, Louise. Your sister-in-law, Augusta, killed my donkey. Can you help? - I'll see what I can do. - Thanks, Louise. - Good night, everyone. - Good night. Thérèse, what are you doing there? Take from the full pail, there's more cream. - 'Night! - 'Night! - You all right? - I'm fine. - My bike! - I'll fix it. The milk! - Are you hurt? - Are you the new doctor? I'm at Despiau's. I'll drive you. - Not without the milk. - We'll go and get more. - What's your name? - Marie. - You? - Alexandre. Alexandre's a nice name. - Take this for the milk. - I won't! - Take it! - No! - Will you stay here long? - Two months. - Me too. Then back to Paris? - Yes, I hope so. - Maybe I'll see you there. - Your bike! - Sorry? - Come on. Get in. - You're at 64 Rue de Provence? - Yes. Too bad, we don't live in the same neighborhood. Let me off at the edge of the village, please. All right! If you feel sore, come and see me. - Bye. - Bye, Marie. No hard feelings. Grandma, today I met the new doctor and spoke to him. I like his name, Alexandre. He's really nice. Why don't you go to bed? Thérèse and Fred are in love. They make a baby and they aren't married. So? So what do you want to know exactly? Catherine! Catherine! Someone's calling you, but who? Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! I know you're there. I know it! I see you. You're mean! And beautiful! You're mean! We'll meet on God's acre. What's God's acre? The cemetery. Have you known Maurice long? Since the Great War. He's from the east. You were both young. He was staying at Augusta's. - Grandpa was jealous of him. - Papa is like that too. Sleep here. I'm not tired, are you? Hundreds of years ago, when the world was young, a volcano spewed fire here. Must've been a sight to see. I've danced the waltz of passion. There was a handsome young man and a young wife. When poor Maurice showed up, it was too late. When my son was born, you could say he was a love child, because we made him the first day of summer under the stars. That poor old man knows it. The next full moon, we'll do something together. Marie had given up her friends in favour of watching Alexandre. She found him absolutely wonderful. Hoping to talk to him again, she decided to start following him. That's what Fred told me. "If there was a war, I'd be happy, because... I'd go and get killed by a shell. Dead men can't think." I said, think hard about it, no one's ever come back to tell us. There you are! Where were you? You're red as a beet! Don't drink cold water, you'll make yourself ill! Do your homework. Your father is looking for you all over. - Answer, Marie. - Yes, Grandma. I would like to be outside. Work is freedom. - You couldn't understand. - Yes, we can, Mrs. Farjat. - He's finished his day. - Good night. Good night! Married for 13 years. And still in love. It hurts a bit. Let me see. Sit down. All right. You should get the strap on your clog adjusted. - Did your mother send you? - No, why? Marie... You've been seen often out on the highway. I'm just riding around. - And your homework? - Done. Not for the last 3 days. You'd rather be outside? Do you know Augusta? - The lace-maker? - No, the witch. - She knows about love potions. - What's that? A drink. You share it half-half with your chosen one, and you fall in love. Does it work? My love! I love you! You love me? You proved it by having a child with me. See? If you'd come with me, we'd have shared the harvest. My love! I spoke to my father. Your father, that old hypocrite? He had a child out of wedlock with my Aunt Augusta. Don't say that. - I love you! - Don't listen to that. Why not? Because love is a never-ending battle. The old, the young, all in the same boat. Who was her father? Who was her mother? Had she a sister? Had she a brother? Or was there a dearer one still, and a nearer one yet, than all others ? What's that in French? "Is there one dearer to her?" No... "Was there one dearer to her yet?" I can do better... "Where was there a dearer one still, more precious than all others?" Yes, that's it. Who was her father? Who was her mother? Had she a sister? Had she a brother? Where was there a dearer one still, more precious than all others? - Very good. - Thanks. No! Shit! Marie, come here! - Now! - I'll hold your grenadine. - Did you memorise it? - Yes, father. - Let's hear it. - In French or English? Both. Who was her father? Who was her mother? Had she a sister? Had she a brother? Where was there a dearer one still, more precious than all others? That's enough. Get out! You stay here. Marie was secretly happy, Now she was allowed outside, because her father had suddenly decided to help with his cousins' harvest. Mother, when papa shouted, it was my fault. I'm all excited these days. Don't cry, Mother. I love you. I'm very upset my son took off without telling me. - I didn't do anything. - It's nothing against you. You're late and you eat nothing. Aren't you hungry? - Then go to your room. - Yes, Grandma. Look. It's for you. - I really enjoy your company. - I'm glad. I like green eyes. - Do you have a father? - He's dead. - Do you have a mother? - She's in Paris. - How old are you? - 30. That's not so old. - Coming? - I want my bike. Marie, come on. You can have children? Yes, but not forever. - Does it hurt? - Depends. You get used to it. You can't tell me, right? Everyone knows. It's natural. Do you have your period your whole life? Almost. Till you're 50. My whole life! - Want to get in bed? - Yeah. - This is pretty. - I've had it for 10 years. - Where were you? - In the woods. - Nice day. - Yes... Eva, lock the door when you come in. This house has no men. Nothing to say today? Then I'll ask the questions. Is your mother beautiful? Born in Holland? Love potion contains periwinkle, angelica and coriander. Choose the right moment in summer, at the full moon, like on St. John's Eve. It must involve more than that. There's Augusta! Jules's donkey died, and I'm sure she did it. - She has a book. - Which one? I can't say. - Don't remember? - It could hurt us. - What? - It could hurt us. My love! I love you! It's me, Marie. I love you. I love you. - Look... - No, I love you. If you loved me, you'd have made me happy and kissed me. Marie, you're just a little girl. I'm grown up! You're scared. You're scared. I'm not scared. Marie... Why are you always running around? You call it exploring, but that's not what it is. Have you met someone? Are you in love with someone? You can tell me anything. Truth is what sets you free. They're going on the road. Get off the road. It's dangerous. - Hello, doctor. - Hello, you two. - Taking my advice? - Yes. I take a walk every day. You see how secretive my daughter is. You never told me you knew him. Thanks to Marie, I know everyone round here. No, you know I don't smoke. Get in the back, Marie. Stop that noise, please. We'll get out here, please. How about that! What are you doing this afternoon? What does it look like? I'm ironing. That so? What's going on? You're all restless. A love too good, too strong, too pure. Really? I want to make the most of it. I want to enjoy it. What do you know about me? Alexandre Néterre, only son. My father's name was Matisse. He disappeared in Prague at a young age. My mother's in Paris. - Know what I'm thinking about? - The war. And love. About love, about war. - Who's there? - Me, Marie. Not many people sit by me. Don't you get bored? Me? No... I'm waiting for my imminent death. Being a doctor means being always ready to serve. Patients can get well through their own efforts. But doctors must pave the way to enhance those efforts. Doctor, help me, I'm sick. So am I, ma'am. What we need is wine, and... and music. Who was that? My mother wrote to me. "Dear Alexandre, How they live and die in the Israelite camps in Germany! It's terrible. I'm afraid for you. This article isn't recent. I cut it out of the July 25 paper. Take good care of yourself. Thinking about you, Mother." What's that? A button mother lost in the woods. Did your mother show you the 3 little monkeys? Do you know why? Do you? See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Right. Do as they do. No, I don't want it. - Do you have your key? - Yes. Look. Tonight's the night we have something to do together. I love the full moon... I love the full moon, that turns toads into musicians... It's moon water, and the moon's always beneficial. Bring it to my room. After I die, promise you'll continue? You won't die. Of course I will. Everyone does. Promise? I promise. You'll break the prison. Your father's harvesting. He'll be back after they thresh. The imbecile didn't even write to you. Ten years too late! I can't lose you. Good-bye. Not good-bye. Marie had lost all hope of being loved by Alexandre. Augusta had love potion, and now her father was coming back, Marie wanted to reconcile her parents. Augusta the witch scared her a little, but she listened carefully to her advice. She would know the correct dose: half for her mother, half for her father. The effect would be immediate, they'd fall in love again, and life would return to normal. Papa! Marie! Sweetheart! My little fairy! Hey, there's Marie! They said it wouldn't last in '14. - Stop staring at my wife. - Better than mine! He's not the only one! - Need help? - No, go to your father. Can't anyone be serious? Why so sad? To work! Work is freedom, my grandma said so. From '14-'18, 570,000 peasants were cannon fodder. Let Mélanie do it. Go and sit with Jean. When I'm finished. - Ladies? - A glass of red wine, sir. The Croix-de-Feu don't protect the French. - Nor do the Germans or Italians. - The Americans don't care. - What do you want? - Nothing. I don't want anything. Go kiss your mother... for me. Get her to forgive me. To us! Tell me, where is the great love I was waiting for? Is he in a city or on a deserted island? He's in the cradle of fate, at the crossroads, under the jasmine, in the heat of summer, in the palm of the hand, next to the truth. Tell me, who is the great love I've been waiting for? Is he a crazy bird, a wolf or a dog that lost its way? He's a foreign traveller, a solitary messenger come to wreak changes in the summer heat. Eva! Eva! Don't get undressed. HITLER SPEAKING ON THE RADIO Hitler's making threats. If he invades Poland, we're done for. Did you hear that? You understand that foreign language? My dream came back. I dreamed our volcano started spewing again. There were red lights in the sky, purple ones, then the lava started flowing. It covered the grass and the cows floated by. Trees too. Sorry! I'm late. The important thing is you're well-rested. - What's so funny? - The volcano. Anyway, Jean's happy. Tomorrow was the village fair, and the locals set about building the dancefloor on the fair grounds. They spread out through the woods cutting the beechwood that would form the edge of the fair, where they planned to dance all night. Romain's dying. Go and get the doctor. Mélanie! I hate this! Fred! Come quickly. Your father's dying! Fred, I'm sorry. I need to see you. Adrien will be furious. Now you can have your Thérèse, right, Fred? That's all I can think about. Does the baby look like my son? He looks like himself, but there's a family resemblance. Romain! What a dancer! Yes. Let's get going, Mélanie. Bye, Louise. He caused me a lot of trouble, but he was a man. A real man. When you were born, it was he who held the light. Money! Coins! He's not doing badly for himself! Go ahead. Dance with her. You're at that age. Let's stop, son. I've had enough. Mrs. Farjat, I've been waiting. Shall we dance? I'm amazed you're not drunk tonight? No, and I even shaved for the occasion. Then why not? Catherine, can I have the next dance? Ah, let's see. Let's see. May I have this dance? It's cold. Let's go home. Want one? War was declared, a war that would cause unending strife and innumerable deaths. Nothing would ever be the same. The gentle way of life was over.
