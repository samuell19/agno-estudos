Greetings to one and all Wondering what I'm doing in this movie? I've got nothing to do with this movie This story travels across London, Turkey, Pakistan and many more countries If people belonging to those nations speak their tongue then our audience won't understand Add subtitles, then audience must toggle between it and the scene That'd cause confusion in reading subtitles and watching movie. Hence... all the people belonging to different countries... are made to speak Tamizh So, all the characters in the movie will speak Tamizh Which is for our convenience We believe it'll make your viewing a pleasure Also, we believe that you'll like this movie Thank you.

It was three months ago, on your birthday I was confident that I'll confess my love for you But you were asleep I didn't know what to do So, out of love, I kissed you I kissed you on that day saying the three words - 'I love you' You don't even know that Today, again I'm going to kiss you saying another three words - 'Get well soon' And you won't even know this Madam, please don't disturb the patient Oh! Come on! Couldn't you've come two seconds late? I just missed a kiss! I agreed to play along with Subash because he compelled me a lot. Really sorry What kind of childish-ness is this? An operation to clear terrorist camp in Poonch. 45 terrorists... and we pulled off the mission with zero causalities So, in two days I will be awarded the gallantry award, Kirti chakra Politics never allowed you guys to attend when I won medals in school and college Hence, I staged a drama Not just that. Three days relief for you from your political life. Hence, I lied You pulled it off really well! You almost gave us all a heart attack In a way it benefited me Also, I found out what everyone thinks of me Like you lied, whatever I said was also a lie! - Su... - Please no! - Superb! - Thanks dear, brother-in-law Terrorists like Syed Ibrahim Malik, who stay in Pakistan... are the ones bringing bad reputation to our nation Malik is not just a global terrorist but also a most wanted criminal by the Interpol If they say, they want to send Mallik out from Pakisthan ...as an opposition leader, I warn you that I'll start my fasting unto death My question to the current government is that are they supporting Malik? And thereby are they promoting terrorism indirectly? If they don't chase him away within a week then we will stage a protest! Stop! Who are you? Where are you coming from? - What's in your bag? - Look! Over there! - Please leave me! Leave me! - Stop! Catch him! - Leave me! - Catch him! Stop! Don't go there! Who are you? What's going on? - Greetings - Greetings Malik! How dare you blast bomb in our country? Just because we let you live here... don't think the Pakistan government will be a mute spectator to your atrocities! If we call off your security for even a second... the Indian government will hunt you down and finish you off! Duplicate rascal! You squint eyes! Where is the real Malik? Tahir! You've known us for years. Can't you still differentiate between him and myself? - Forget that! Whatever you did has... - Tahir! Tahir... Of late if anyone challenges me... or raises their voice; it irks me a lot You have finished off the opposition party leader! It's has become a major issue I carried out 17 blasts in my country, for you guys For my sake, can't I do it once in your country? You or your government aren't guarding me for free! You guys are just working for the millions of money I pay you! So mind your business, that of a watchman! Leave! Listen, Tahir! Don't forget... I am an NRI Non Reliable Indian! See you! Dear brothers and sisters, I am really happy to see you all here Initially Malik used to respect us a lot but now he shows no respect at all! When will see his end? - Soon - When, sir? Elections are about to happen in India IPDP's leader, Indra Gupta ji... is set to be the next prime minister according to all the opinion polls If he becomes the prime minister... then no matter where Malik is, in Pakistan or any corner of the world... he won't spare him! I promise you all... that India's most wanted criminal... Syed Ibrahim Malik will be arrested and brought to India in 30 days time If anyone will still try to spread terrorism in my nation... - then we will give them an apt reply! - Ji, what a overwhelming response! Are you watching it? This is not very important Our parties alliance conference in Tamil Nadu is what matters the most Don't worry. Our conference will be a success Then... from the list of regions you gave us... Krishnagiri and Sri Perambudur are the ones posing issues I'll talk to Gupta ji and get it sorted.

Invading others privacy is so easy for you, isn't it? Look here... I've been noticing you. You don't seem to have a limit on your tongue Come again? You'll enjoy as my body will be carried in a coffin? You'll idolize the guy who shoots me? Until you're here, make sure that you don't show me your face again! Get lost! I've a doubt What is it?

I now request Mr. Gupta ji to address the people Greeting, Tamizh Nadu Honorable Shri. KRK... - Where did she go? - I don't know Tell me Where are you? Dad's asking about you. Come here at once Is Meera there? Hello Hel... Madam, she has our phone. Don't let her escape! During our tenure in the government, every state will be given equal importance We will also act on the Cauvery issue immediately Like RKS ji said, we shall also look into the medical entrance exam issue Deepak! Hello. Saravana! Where are you? Forget about me. You better get away from the dias! There are rumours about you making rounds here! We'll deal that later. You first leave from there! What do you mean? And with your help, we shall achieve all this It's for your good! You better leave that place! Now! Subash! Check what happened to Mr. Gupta! He trusted us and came here. Ensure nothing happens to him It's our duty to ensure his safety! Please, check on him! Gupta ji! Gupta ji! Dear brother! Gupta ji! Gupta ji! Sources say that the bomb blast that took place wasn't carried out by terrorists... and in fact some politicians are said to be behind it Please tell us! What's our minister's condition? Hello...Hello, yes it's confirmed I just got the report. He died on the spot No! It was a bomb made up of dangerous chemical combinations It was secretly fixed inside the AC and the blasted using a remote Ok, I'll do it Entire country is in chaos! A high command order has been passed to shift the body to Delhi - Our leader... - Shut up! - That too in our state, he was... - I said, shut up! Go to the airport and arrange a private jet at once! Understand? Please! Take him out! Ensure all the arrangements are done in the party office at Delhi - Come on, brother. Let's go out - But why? What's our fault? - Sir, it's better you leave - What happened? The situation is just not good. Just leave. I'll talk to you later! Please! Dude, what's happening? Subash, things have gone awry I just want to ensure your safety Please leave! Is my safety more important than the issue going on here? Tell me, what happened to my party people? Only 10 people died in bomb blast But more than 15 have died in the stampede! - Where are all those people? - Same hospital, different block - Sir, we'll handle it - Get lost! - Sir! - Dear brother! Yes, sister-in-law? Meera isn't home yet Her phone is out of reach. Is she with you? No, she isn't with me She might have lost her way amidst that crowd. I shall wait The identities of the deceased are still unknown. I've ordered the officers to identify it - Look at this! Look what happened! - Please! Move! Move! Dear brother... How did this happen? Oh my God! How did this happen? They found her lying dead in the backstage She had went to the parking lot to get her phone but got killed in the stampede She died from choking and suffocation according to the autopsy report To hell with your party and it's flag! Die! KRK down! Down! RKS party down! Down! What's going on, dear? I have no idea, dad We've requested two more battalion forces to bring the situation under control Until then you and your family stay in one room for your safety First, tell us what's going on? No one has the guts to tell it to your face Watch it for yourself Riots everywhere in Tamizh Nadu following Mr. Gupta's death in the bomb blast Deputy CM, Sarvanan could be the mind behind this according to sources Could be? It's the fact! Deepak Mehta and Saravana are thick friends They approved Deepak Mehta a loan of 40 billion and in return he carried out the bomb blast If Deepak hadn't absconded to abroad... they would've closed the case saying it is the plot by our enemies How would killing the leader benefit deputy CM? Sympathy votes. His dad just made him the leader of the party... and this is Saravana's trick to win his first election! In fact when the bomb blast took place, Saravnan got a call and stepped away I got the information that call was from the absconding Deepak Mehta The case must be handled to CBI to bring the truth I'm innocent I have proof Forget about me. You better get away from the dias! There are rumours about you making rounds here! We'll deal that later. You first leave from there! Sengunram... arrange a press meet at our home, at once! Dear, our house bride to be is lying dead down there... is the press meet necessary at this point? Never put hold on putting out the fire! Yes, sir. I'm at the CM's house I'll collect the news and reach Subash... our brother had ordered for the press meet. He went into his room... The press is here but he locked himself in the room and isn't answering the door I'm worried! - Dear, please open the door - Sir, please open the door - Dear, what are you doing in there? - Sir, please open Move! What happened? He is not opening the door - Dear brother! Brother! - Dear, please! Dear brother! Oh dear brother! A little while ago, deputy CM Saravanan committed suicide by hanging himself in his house It is doubted that Mr.Saravanan has a hand in Gupta ji's murder In this situation, Saravanan's death confirms his involvement The crowd surrounding the chief minister's house is getting uncontrollable Following his, all the MSK party offices all over Tamizh Nadu is slowly closing down Daddy! As my elder son, you must be carrying out my final rites after my death... but look at my plight that I now have to carry out your final rites Subash, the mob is furious at your family and going crazy Begin the proceedings A small request Use the back gate and not the front one Bharathwaj! What do you mean by that? All there is a riot going outside your house Hence, sir... Is my son a thief, a terrorist or an orphan? - Why must we use the back gate? - Sir, please understand 1000s are waiting outside with weapons, thinking your son was also involved in the blast The situation is not our favor. Too much of hatred out there To hell with it! I have faced worse in my experience! Kumaresa, call up the capital, Delhi! Now! The one who is suppose is lead is gone forever! The one suppose to run the government is been taken away like an orphan! See you dear, brother-in-law Subash, our brother's wife hasn't ate anything since two days She isn't talking to anybody I'm worried Please, go check on her My husband is honest and genuine He is an innocent who never thinks ill of or evil towards anyone But did you notice how everyone is being talking so cruel about him? When I hear all this... is pushing me to end my life Please dear, sister-in-law Whoever killed me dad, we must not spare their life uncle They must shed tears like the way we are shedding now! - Tell me - Subash... Remember the vehicle number Meera scribbled in her hand before she was killed? We found it and also found where it was bought Come here, at once You must punish them Two days ago, a woman and two men came here and bought the van All the documents they submitted is bogus None of the CCTV works in this shop But we have a small footage from the CCTV at the exit But we aren't able to trace anyone using that Sir, please pause it Rewind a little bit Stop! Zoom in This tattoo seems familiar to me Bharath... this lady was at my home when my brother died! Who could she be? On that day, apart from your relatives and the party people... the only strangers at your home were the journalists from the press media Every one from press media has signed the register while security check Look! Look carefully! That's her She has entered the house... but she is missing from the spot where other journalists were waiting for my brother All the press people dispersed after the news of my brother's death She pops out of the blue and joins the exiting press people She came in with everyone And left along with them She went missing for 15 minutes in between Exactly when my brother died Look! Gupta ji, Meera and my elder brother... the only common factor in these three deaths is her! She came in posing as the photographer along with Kalai Murasu reporter Malathi Catch hold of Malathi and we can get to her! Sir! We inquired at the Kalai Murasu office... reporter Malathi, whom you talk of, hasn't turned up to office since two days Is it? Why? No idea, sir She left saying that she'll submit the report about your brother's death and be back But she only returned as a corpse She was on her scooter and a truck ran her over. They delivered her to us like a package Did I raise her with so much love, only to lose her? Does your daughter have any friend with a tattoo on their neck? The girl with tattoo on her neck? She met her only two days ago. Very kind girl The day your brother died, she accompanied my daughter as photographer But she didn't turn up after my daughter died Sir, can I get your daughter's diary or cell phone Malathi didn't have the habit of writing diary The police returned it to us and told us that it broke during the accident Our last hope in this case... is this phone She's too clever She has formatted the phone already There is no information in it I guessed it There must be back up in Google drive. Try retrieving the data using the email id Ok Yes! We have back up of all the files Copy that What? Crap! She is always a step ahead of us She is hacking the data from a different location and deleting it The last saved files are the ones deleted first We cannot find her now We can! Trace the user's location who deleted this data Sure! Mexico! She is there! Iran! Indonesia! London! Sri Lanka! It's showing five different locations She is brilliant! She is using proxy server to confuse us Out of these five location only one is her true location But we can't find out which one is it London! But how? In the security CCTV footage, while she was signing the register... I noted her mobile phone It had two time zones. The difference between the one and the IST was 4.5 hours Out of these five locations... the only time zone with a difference of 4.5 hours is London If we check the list of passengers who flew to... London on the same day as my brother died... and we'll find her Sir, she has travelled to London in British Airways on the date you mentioned All the details are here in this file Her name is Kaira She is a professional killer Most wanted criminal by the Interpol As far as we know, she is based out of London But no one knows about her target and her whereabouts I'll go in search of her The only evidence we have to reach her... is the fake passport that she used I'm sure the address in it is also fake How will you trace with that? I have no option The one getting chased has many directions to run but the one chasing has only one! "Oh my Superhero, come to me" "Hey Superhero!" "I leave no job incomplete! I finish what I start! I am like the..." "Fire! Fire!" "I'm invincible! I'm unstoppable! I breathe..." "Fire! Fire!" "You can near me but never catch me! I'm the most dangerous venom" "I need no weapon to kill you!

That's a granny Grandpa, close the door! Please help me find that girl I swear I don't the girl you're looking for But four persons came in search of her before you Then I hear that all four died under mysterious circumstances You look very innocent... So run for your life and head back home - You can reach just by taking two steps - Brother, you say you're a Tamizhan... Won't you help a fellow Tamizhan?

How did you find it? Digging out information about strangers; that's my profession I'm a professional hacker - Unbelievable - Why? Don't I look like an hacker? You look like a real estate broker! This sarcasm is what stops me from helping fellow Tamizhans The doorbell that you rang at my doorstep... is a finger print scanner I collected all your details using your fingerprint Do you get it now? When you're so skilled, why can't you help me find the whereabouts of that girl? It's not as easy as it sounds! In order to find any detail in net, you need some information Got it? Next flight to India is at 6 'O clock. Hope you're leaving What? The old couple living right opposite to you They are my house owner What's the matter? I need their phone number What do they have go to do this? When I rang your doorbell, they opened their door before you opened yours Poor elder citizens. If they were Indians they'd be watching TV serial They being from here they might have been eager for some gossip I saw the same exact tattoo in their home which that girl had in her neck Those who died in pursuit of Kaira... I guess that couple must have some link to their deaths What should I do? Get me the details of their incoming calls... and outgoing calls made in last half an hour It's a walk in the park But it'll cost you a bit Don't give me that look! Pay me and I shall open my laptop Or else, forget it I'll pay you. Do it Mr. Military, only one outgoing call made in last half an hour I have messaged you the number A message that Rs. 50,000 has been withdrawn from my account. Who did it? - That's none other than me - You did it? Is only 'Action King' Arjun allowed to hack your account? I just took my fee in advance I have sent you her number. Dude! I'm getting a call from her number Hello Hand the phone to the guy next to you Why won't you talk to me? Stupid! Just give it to him Brainless! Loser! Do what I say She has something to tell you. Here, talk - Hello Kaira - What's up? Are you here in London, to avenge the death of your family members? With all your connections in politics and with police... I still managed to kill your family members with ease and that too in your city This is my hood! Just imagine how easy it is for me to finish you off Quit showing off your heroism and go back! Where is Deepak Mehta? Deepak might have betrayed you But I won't betray him If I can find your number... - Then don't you think I can find you? - You mean call tracking? Idiot! How will you trace me if you I break this SIM and throw it away Even if you search nook and corner of London for the next 10 years... you won't be able to catch me You may fear me and throw away the SIM to escape But I've no fear "9444131157" That's my number I'll be waiting for you at the Trafalgar Square, tomorrow morning. I'll be in a red tee I have only my will power and nothing else You show off that this is your hood... Then I dare you to come We'll see What did she tell you? She said she'll kill anyone and everyone who is on my team Hey! I'm the only one here, in your team She wants to kill me for hacking a granny's phone? I don't care how but it's your duty to safe guard me! - There is only one way I can do that - What's that? - I'll think of an idea and tell tomorrow - So you're here without any idea? There's no one, who will save me if I get bashed up in India! Here you are, pushing me into trouble here in London! Here, take it Here you go. You! Here Take it Look, I remember all your faces Wear it and roam around in this very place. If you leave, I'll find you and bash you up! Here, take it! Take it! I said 'Only for men' yet why are you snatching it? Get lost! Excuse me Subash! I distributed all the tee shirts I thought only our people are desperate for freebies but these guys are worse! They are swarming in for freebie! Forget them. Take out the two tee shirts that you've flicked and distribute them too! How did he find out? He is so tall that he can see me from anywhere! Here are the ones I flicked. What should I do with them? - Distribute them and wait. I'll tell you - Here! Take it and get lost!

Right next to me but she's of no use to you - She might be of some use to me - How? Because she available for all not just one Do you have any sense? Not the time! Don't always think only about yourself Spare a thought for me too You're issue is that you're not able to find one girl Where as my issue is that I'm not even able to find one girl You're nearing him To your right - Just 70 metres - Got it! What's the status? Hold on for a second Two guys are talking very seriously on a call The numbers too seem to be familiar You! Whom are you talking to? You!

Look, six of them are in a conference call Five of them are here but one of them is a little away That's her! Find out her location Watch me! I'll get you that in two minutes Just 20 metres. Go straight What happened? 10 seconds. You're nearing her How long is it going to take? You can shout at me and I'll speed up but Google won't! Hold on for two more seconds Yes! I found it! 200 metres from here, on the right In Victoria hall - She is there. Got it? - Thanks Jack Where is he headed? Hey Subash! Uh-oh! He left his phone here but why? Chief, where is he? 3 metres To your left Target found Yes, what's up? Why are you hacking this number? Rascal! That's my profession Guys! Bash him Why are you guys hitting me? - Not my face, please! I'm still single - Yes, chief? Idiots! You found the wrong guy He is here Make it fast! Guys, let's go! You guys just turned a hacker into a joker! Mr. Subash... well done! That was an awesome way to thank me for being a help to you for past two days! Chief, catch! He cannot save you So don't try to save him Now, tell me Where is Deepak? Torture me as much you want but I won't tell - I have some ethics - Ethics? You're a contracted killer! What ethics are you speaking about? You... You've a message from your bank Without realizing that you'll be dead in sometime... someone has transferred you 0.5 million USD to kill a target That target is none other than you! The have a very huge network If not me they will still finish you off using somebody else Go back! That's your only chance to live I will definitely go... but in pursuit of Deepak How'd you reach him without me telling you his location? You don't have to tell me Your phone already did! Who is it? Who are you? Subash! Help me! Subash! Save me! Save your ethics I'll give you his location! Please, save me! Stomp her to death Only then they'll believe that she died in the stampede What do I want? One plate Baklava and two plates of cat Biriyani Keep it ready. I just have to get rid of someone. I'll do it and be back - Ok? - What's up dear brother-in-law? - You didn't have to come - I'm not here to receive you - I'm here to send you back - What do you mean? Already this issue took Meera and your elder brother away from us And here you are to take revenge. What if something happens to you? Leave! - Listen to me... - Subash - Hi Subash - What is she doing here? She refused a promotion, requested a foreign affairs posting and moved to Turkey Wonder why she did that But I know Come on, nothing of that sort I needed a break He was about to say something Well, dear brother-in-law... When people have a heart break they move away for a break... so that their heart break heals, they get ready for next heart break and thus the break... - Actually what's your plan - I'll tell you Is he here to romance or relax? Dear brother-in-law! Diya, the account from which Kaira received the money for murdering me... is from a bank here in Istanbul - Guess, whose account is that - Whose? - Deepak Mehta's account - What? Yeah We must find his address using that account number In Turkey, even if you have one's address still it'd be hard to find them And you think you guys can find him using his account details? No chance! You better have a leisure tour and go back home One more time you say something negative... Uh-oh! Subash... things will be easy if we take our government's help In this situation, I can't trust anybody I tried ing the bank data to get his account details But I couldn't They've installed very strong firewalls in their system Password is dynamic which keeps changing at intervals Very tight security system I couldn't break them Awesome! I'm so proud that I have an account in such a highly secured bank Have some coffee Haven't I warned you from saying anything negative? Did I sound negative now? Wasn't I speaking positive about the bank? You think army man has the rights to beat up a family man? You'll rot in hell! The bank's blue print Blue print helps in building a house but how in find the address? Why are you giving me that look? Did I say something wrong? The customer details are encrypted in the bank's main server It can only be copied from the server room According to the blue print, enter the bank and on the left you've a basement Isn't that the server room? I had been to that bank. It's highly secured bank Especially, the server room The security officer possesses the access card to the server room It cannot be entered without the access card You can chop that guy's hand without his knowledge but can't steal his card His lunch time is 1 - 1:30 He goes to his routine restaurant Is his lunch time fixed one? I confirmed it So, the half an hour lunch time of that security officer... is when we can sneak into the server room? The catch here is that... the account that you want to access from server room must be active to be copied Or else nothing can be done Then, let's do one thing. Let directly call Deepak Mehta.. and request him to keep his account active for half an hour, so we can collect his details Oh come on! Hear out yourself! Sounds like the rumour that Indian 2000 rupee bill has a chip in it! Subash, he only has complaints about our ideas Why don't you give an idea? I'm good at flapping my gums and not giving ideas Get that? Now, that's an idea! The bank manager has a special password to unlock all the accounts You must engage the manager and somehow talk him into opening Deepak Mehta's account - I'll take care of the rest - And? If things go awry and we get busted... We can't escape like we do in India by saying "It wasn't me, it was my admin" This is Istanbul! We'll be doomed! Idea, my foot! I'm your sister's husband not your boxing sand bag! - Uh-oh! Again him! - My sister told me... "Be confident, my husband is there for you. He'll take care of everything " But here? That's not the case Did she really say that? Yes Baby, you really have so much confidence in me? I won't give up Now that my wife has said it... there is no going back! - I will deal the bank manager! - Come on Let's chew some mint and work on that blueprint! If something happens to me in there... then like now, please ask your family to keep taking care of your sister To hell with the confidence she has on me! I pity my plight! What happened? Are you ok? Ouch! I'm on my way Excuse me, sir Rajesh Malhothra? Are you a North Indian? Yes. I also worked in Tamizh Nadu for 10 years doing some crap jobs Of course, that's were you all your crap jobs! So, I need a small help from you Can you confirm if there has been a transfer to my account? You could have checked it online But the internet data isn't sufficient enough The download limit gets over before a full movie is downloaded Yesterday I tried downloading a movie titled "My aunt and the plumber" The aunt meets the plumber, the start talking and they slowly move to bedroom... and done! It keeps buffering. Keeps going round and round Ok. Ok, tell me your account number "75432256" Subash... ask him to do it fast - Don't you order me! - When did I order you? Not you, sir. You focus on the account details No amount has been credited in your account in recent times Sir, please confirm! They guy who promised me to transfer is from Madurai! So what? People from Madurai never lie! You fool! Not the time to talk patriotism! Try making him access Deepak's account Sir, if you don't mind, I'll tell you that guy's account number. Can you check his account? How can I access someone's account without their permission? If David Bekcham questioned himself 'How?' then he wouldn't have wooed Victoria! Arnold Schwarzenegger wouldn't have acted in Noodles advertisement? - And Trump wouldn't have been wrestled in WWE - Trump? He is a good wrestler! Recently, his videos... - Give that guy's account number - "79543299" Got access to his account No money has been transferred from this account Don't allow him to close that account window Keep him engaged for ten minutes so that he doesn't log out, you fool! Whom are you calling a fool? - What? - I'm the fool, sir! I'm the fool! I'm a fool to believe that he will pay me on time! Subash, how long will it take? Ten minutes Diya Ok, cool This is a high value account. This account holder is a big shot Was it really him, who cheated you by not paying? Those who promise to pay are the one... Why are you unnecessarily talking about politics? How do I engage him for 10 minutes without talking? Talking isn't as easy as hacking! Do something! Subash...make it fast What happened? I think he has realized that his access card is missing Subash! He is one his way to the bank. Fast! Diya, I just got access to his account Just now I started copying. Hold him somehow, for few minutes Impossible Impossible? Then I'm leaving! Ok I'll kill you! Only 30% completed Somehow keep him engaged And how do you think I'll do it? - Sir! You were born on the 10th, right? - No I knew it! You couldn't have been born on the 10th. Show me your palm Diya, do something! Sure! Will try You prefer dark and dusky women over fair and bright women - Correct? - Yes! How did you know? That's the psychology of flirts! Your palm tells me that your wife will always be a loner Which is why you are working here! Hey, who are you? Stop! - Hey, stop! - Check him now - Check him! - What are you doing? Leave me How much more to go? 40% I'm a security officer in the bank! - What is this? - I don't how it came to my pocket - According to palm reading, your stars... - Leave my hand! - Here, take this money - No, we don't want your money! Leave me! Leave me! I'm in a hurry So, as per as astrology the Jupiter and the Venus... Enough! Leave my hands! How much should he pay you? - 400 dollars - I'll pay you! Oh my God! What happened, sir? Someone hacked the password I had and accessed this account Someone is transferring the money from this account to another! Crap! Superb sir! Ask him to transfer my 400 dollars too? Get lost! You idiot! Get lost you monkey! - What's happening there? Idiot! - I don't know, sir. Let's check I lost my access card - Let's go - He is trapped! - Just move - Where are you taking me? It's over! He must be caught red handed You have no idea about this country's police There is a very sever punishment... where they will bend the culprit and bump with a stick! It'll take days to recover from that Oh! Oh? Walk slower and let's get caught! Where are you going? I'm hungry. I'm going to grab a bite Got it. You got him trapped in server room Now you got no money, so you'll eat here and get me trapped! So, tell me. Are you alone in this or do you have a team? Whoa! Brother-in-law! Did you decode it? 70% decoded I was panicking that you're trapped and what are you doing here on the laptop? So, you already knew he was here? Yes Wasn't that the plan? Don't show off that you pulled of a small part without my knowledge! Now hear me out. Let me tell you the important part! Someone stole 40 billion rupees from Deepak Mehta's account! I know - You know? - It was me - You? - Of course! You thought I took such a huge risk for just an address? Pay 50 Lira and you can easily get anyone's address 40 billion rupees! Money that belongs to our nation! My dad approved it and he thinks he'll abscond with it? Do you expect me to be a mute spectator? Deepak Mehta's account... and from his proxy accounts, including the interest for that 40 billion... I transferred the amount to the bank that loaned him that money So, I am the fool here. Isn't it? You always have been one! Also, we have his location Algornia Uh-oh! Algornia? I thought I'll only lose my job I'll lose my life too Why? It's a locality completely controlled by the mafia Yes! No army or police can break in to that area Mafia rules over that place If we still want to go there, then someone must invite us from there Diya, do you know someone in that place? No She is new here and you ask her? I've been here for the past four years. Won't you ask me? Not even in my wildest dreams I thought you'll have contact with anyone in Mafia I have no contacts with the mafia but I have contact called Sofia Sofia? Who's that? My girlfriend She lives there Oh God! Is it painful? Not bad Near him and he'll hit me Let me sit here Dear brother-in-law... calm down and put yourself in my shoes 11 months in a year, your sister stays with your family You guys have a population of 1.2 billion in a climate that's as hot as 105 degrees... I live in -2 degree, won't I need a... - Justifying yourself? - It's not like what you think! I'm a pure soul. I just talk to her and nothing else I haven't even got a glimpse of her yet We only talk over phone Tomorrow's her birthday She has invited me I shall take you along Can't wait till tomorrow. We must go today! By now he'd have become alert knowing that money has vanished from his account We must catch him before he takes the next step - Let's go - Forget about catching him... Don't tell your sister about me catching Sofia! Your sister is not like you. You hit me then and there She'll beat me nice and slow Think of my wife and my hand shivers, my leg trembles and I panic! Yet, I won't give up! See that grand structure? That's the entrance to this mafia locality The security will be on a whole different level here! Like a the Rose with thorns all around it's stem; my Sofia lives here Worst simile ever! Not good? How about "A gold fish in the sewage" - Shut up! - Thank you Hey, I want to meet Sofia Wait Someone's here to meet Sofia, check with her Name is Sofia Why do you always carry yourself like you are about to fight? Lower your shoulders! Relax your chest! Have a humble body language or else only our bodies will leave from here Got it? He is my man. Please send him in Sofia! That voice is what I fell for Sofia! You got 10 minutes. Now, go They have only allotted 10 minutes. We can only walk in from here. Come on Where does Sofia live? There Dear brother-in-law... I'll talk to Sofia and get your work done in a smooth manner. Have patience - Sophie! - Yes please - Hello - Sofia? No. I am her maid If the maid is so beautiful... then imagine about the lady of this house! What do you say? Dear brother-in-law? Dear brother-in-law? Near or away; he's always a trouble! Left, Subash. The map says so Where is Sofia? Wait. She'll come Today's my lucky day! Lucky day! Sofia? Yes, darling. I'm your Sofia Darling? - Darling - To hell with you! Thank God he didn't see this I better escaped from her! Run! Run! Here Where? The second house on the left - You wait here - Ok Deepak! Abort! Get her! Open it! Don't let them escape Hold it Go! All set? Go! Go! Go fast! Go! Go! Go fast! You! Why did you ask me to come to her house? Why have the police rounded up my house? Check with the Kimlik card What is he up to? First; you robbed the bank! Now; a murder? Help me oh God! I'm scared! Got it Our guess was wrong. He isn't a criminal He's the Istanbul city commissioner What's going on here? Explain it to me! He played blind and... murdered Deepak He framed me for that murder... and tried nabbing me Why must he murder Deepak? That's what even I don't understand I thought once I catch hold of Deepak everything will be over Deepak is just another bait Catch him and we can find out who's behind all this He is a cop How can we catch him? We must make him find us Diya, whom you're looking for, is in Argub market Tell me... Whom do you work for? Who's behind all this? Refuse and you'll die! Tell me! Refuse and I'll die! Say it and you'll die! Then you die first! I'll tell you! I'll tell you! Ok! I'll tell! Tell me. Malik! Syed Ibrahim Malik Bomb blast in Mumbai! 247 feared dead! Under world don, Syed Ibrahim Malik behind the blasts Syed Ibrahim Malik absconds to Dubai Syed Ibrahim Malik behind Hyderabad bomb blast too 60 feared dead in Kovai bomb blast. Malik, the man behind the blast Malik escapes to Pakistan from Dubai Pakistan government denies the fact that Malik is hiding in their country UN accepts India's plea and declares Syed Ibrahim Malik as an Global terrorist Malik's hideout in Pakistan exposed! Terror that haunts India - Syed Ibrahim Malik! India's most wanted terrorist Syed Ibrahim Malik! The search is still on! I just can't believe this. How come Malik is involved in this? It's only now I got a clear idea about this Gupta ji was set to win the upcoming election and become the prime minister Malik knew that he'd be danger if Gupta ji wins If he'd finished of Gupta ji in North India, automatically the fingers would point at him To avoid getting blamed, the place he chose was... Tamizh Nadu! The political meet in Tamizh Nadu worked in his favor Deepak who was desperately in need of money and professional killer, Kiara... He used both of them and finished off Gupta ji He framed my brother by spreading rumour that he did all this to win the election Then he murdered my brother so that people believed that rumour Let's say what you're saying is true but we need proof! Both, Kiara and Deepak are no more Malik? Isn't he still alive? - What do you mean? - I'll bring Malik to justice! Are you kidding me? We don't even know his whereabouts Pakistan Only we believe that Pakistan government still denies it They even denied the fact that Bin Laden was there Wasn't he attacked and executed? Come on, Subash! That was America! There's difference between their and our force I realize that hence I'm not going there as Colonel Subash! I'm heading to Pakistan just as an individual Our agent has been spying for 10 years there. He hasn't even got a glimpse of Malik! Police, CB CID, CBI... RAW, military, intelligence, customs etc. There are millions of officers in hundreds of department He is just one person! Yet "can't get a glimpse of him", "can't catch him", "can't nab him"... all we keep saying is "can't", I can't take it anymore! Forget Gupta ji and my brother 247 people in Mumbai blast and 120 people in Hyderabad blast! In 26 years more than 7000 people killed over 17 attacks! What are we going to answer to that? Stop talking like crazy! Go in search of him and... I'll die? I'm ok with that! A sad ending is better than an endless sadness I can understand your emotion But officially I cannot be of any help It's ok, sir. I can manage - I'll start at once - You're leaving? How will you go? You're a wanted criminal here Legally, you can't cross the Istanbul border The only way is by road through Syria, Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan and that too illegally Yes, that's what we are trying for If you're taking that route, then I can help you but unofficially Once you reach Pakistan, contact our agent, Imran But one condition... This is an international issue involving two nations If you're caught or trapped during this mission of yours... I know, you will have to let go of me Thank you Subash... I'll join you No. I'll take care of this This is my personal problem Which is why I said, I'll join you Look, she is saying it because she means it Take her along. How long can you stay alone? Don't you need a companion? "Smile at me or stare at me or even if you think about me..." "Even if you set me ablaze..." "Love me or even if you make me fall for you..." "Hug me or even if you finish me off..." "You drive me crazy" "Your the only one I see all around me" "No words of yours will ever hurt me" "I am stuck in your love web" "I'm stranded unable to confess my love" "This silence is wearing us off" "Smile at me or stare at me or even if you think about me..." "Even if you set me ablaze..." "Let me bring out the love that is dead inside you" "Also let me shower my love on you" "I will love you forever" "I am waiting high and dry, for you" "When you walk away in silence, it kills me" "Realizing there's no love for me, I continue to be a good friend to you" "Wish the time freezes when I rest of your shoulder" "Wish I could hug you and never let go forever" "Wish the time freezes when I rest of your shoulder" "Wish I could hug you and never let go forever" "My day starts with thoughts about you" "We are already lovers in my dream" "I find myself lost in your eyes" "My untold love for you kills me everyday" "Oh Love! Where are off to, leaving me high and dry?" "Please don't kill me with that killer looks of yours" "Wish the time freezes when I rest of your shoulder" "Wish I could hug you and never let go forever" "Smile at me or stare at me or even if you think about me..." "Even if you set me ablaze..." "Love me or even if you make me fall for you..." "Hug me or even if you finish me off..." Excuse me, is this the way to Nawaz Khan road?

Please go inside My niece is get married in Delhi Here to get her wedding dress stitched Collect it from this place after two days You want to abduct Malik to India without anybody's knowledge? No chance at all! Do you think this is as easy as a food take away? Malik is under ISIS control No one can bypass them and near him! It's been 10 years since I'm here as an undercover cop The assignment Rehman sir gave me was to find just one evidence that he is here Apart from stitching clothes I could achieve nothing in all these years In fact, I couldn't even manage to get a glimpse of him 15 years ago... RAW team caught him was the last heard news Then they said that it wasn't him but his body double... tossing that news into the garbage! That's when he escaped and came here This government takes money from him... and has provided him a palace with all facilities and military security They treat him like a king! Can I see his house? Why are they decorating the house? Any occasion? I heard that his daughter is getting married in three days Won't he step out for it?
