IT'S ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN JOINED GROIN TO GROIN. YOU GET IT? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN SINGING IN SPANISH] COME HERE. NO, NO, NO. LIKE THIS. [LAUGHS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GROANING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] MOM? Mom: I'M IN HERE. I HAVEN'T GOT ANY CLOTHES. HAVE YOU LOOKED ON YOUR BEDROOM FLOOR? YEAH, BUT I MEAN CLEAN ONES. PICK THEM UP, I'LL CLEAN THEM, OK? YEAH. WHY ARE YOU JOGGING, DAD? I WANT TO GET FIT. YEAH? WHAT FOR? I DON'T WANT TO DIE. WELL, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE. YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DIE JUST YET.

IS THERE SOME POINT WHERE A SON STOPS KISSING HIS FATHER? APPARENTLY. POLICE! [SHOUTING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING STOPS] YOU WENT IN A BIT HARD. THE GUY DEALS DRUGS. HE'S SCUM. YEAH, BUT HE WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE. WHAT'D YOU EXPECT ME TO DO? [SIGHS] YOU SEEING ANYONE? NOT WITH THE HOURS I KEEP. YOU COULD'VE MET SOMEBODY ON THE FORCE. MALE COPS ARE LOUSY IN BED. THERE IS SOMEONE. HE EATS IN THE SAME RESTAURANT AS I DO. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HIM YET? WE'VE EXCHANGED GLANCES. OOH. IT'S A START. HOW'S SONJA? SHE'S GOOD. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER AROUND FOR A WHILE. YEAH, WELL... SHE'S BUSY, YOU KNOW, WITH THE BOYS AND WORK. TELL HER I SAID HI. I WILL. Woman: HAVE YOU TOLD HIM YOU'RE NOT HAPPY? [SCOFFS] I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE HE WOULDN'T NEED TO BE TOLD. [LAUGHS] THAT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD AN ACTOR YOU ARE. WELL, I GUESS I MUST BE PRETTY GOOD. HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR MARRIAGE TO BE? PASSIONATE. AND--AND... CHALLENGING AND--AND HONEST. ISN'T IT HONEST? NOT EMOTION... NOT EMOTIONALLY, IT ISN'T. IT JUST FEELS... LIKE WE'RE... YOU KNOW, LIKE WE'RE JUST... [SIGHS] GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, YOU KNOW? AND I WANT MORE... I WANT MORE THAN THAT. Man: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME DR. VALERIE SOMERS. [APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [APPLAUSE DIES DOWN] WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO FEEL ANYMORE, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG ANYMORE-- THE CONFUSED CRY OF THE MODERN AGE. WE ASK, "WHAT CAN WE BELIEVE IN? WHAT SHOULD WE BELIEVE IN?" OUR POLITICIANS? HARDLY. OUR PRIESTS? YOU'D BE AMAZED AT HOW MANY CLIENTS COME TO SEE ME BECAUSE THEY ONCE BELIEVED IN A PRIEST. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY, BUT IT IS. WHAT, THEN? OUR PARENTS? HOME IS A SANCTUARY... FOR A PRIVILEGED FEW. FOR MOST, IT'S A BATTLEGROUND. IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE LIKE THAT, BUT IT IS. LOVE? CAN WE BELIEVE IN LOVE? FEEL SAFE IN IT? LOVING SOMEONE MEANS WE HAVE TO RELINQUISH POWER, DOESN'T IT? IT'S MUTUAL SURRENDER. BUT HOW CAN THIS TAKE PLACE? TRUST. TRUST IS AS VITAL TO HUMAN RELATIONSHIPS AS BREATH IS TO LIFE. AND JUST AS ELUSIVE. 2 YEARS AGO, MY 11-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED. HER NAME WAS ELEANOR. THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, BUT IT DID. IT SEEMED TO GO WELL. I WAS WORRIED YOU WEREN'T GOING TO BE THERE. I SAID I WOULD BE. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] DO YOU WANT A WHISKEY? NO. I'VE GOT AN EARLY CLIENT. LISTEN, WHY DON'T WE TAKE SEPARATE CARS IN THE MORNING? I'VE GOT A LATE MEETING, AND THAT WAY YOU WON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR ME IN TOWN. IT'S FINE. I'VE GOT PLENTY OF WORK I CAN DO. YOU CAN PICK ME UP AFTER YOUR MEETING. SURE. OK. Patrick: I MET SOMEONE. WE WENT HOME AND HAD SEX. AS YOU DO. WELL, SOME OF US DO. AND HE ASKED TO SEE ME AGAIN. I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT. AND? WELL, AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT, I SAID YES. ANYWAY, WE'VE... BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE. AND YOU LIKE HIM? YES, I DO-- VERY MUCH. SO? [SIGHS] HE COMES ENCUMBERED... WITH A WIFE. IS HE GAY? [LAUGHS] WELL, WHEN HE'S WITH ME, HE SEEMS TO BE. DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT YOU? I ASSUME SO. SHE WOULD SENSE IT, WOULDN'T SHE? IT DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD HE IS AT DECEIVING HER. OR HOW GOOD SHE IS AT DECEIVING HERSELF. [INSECTS BUZZING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN SINGING IN SPANISH] TURN THE PAGE. TURN THE PAGE. Jane: HI, NIK. YOU HAVING A PARTY IN THERE, JANE? YEAH. DID YOU WANT TO JOIN ME? TAKE THIS INSIDE FOR MUMMY.

JUST GO UP TO THE GUY'S TABLE AND ASK HIM IF YOU CAN JOIN HIM. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE? JUST A LITTLE DIGNITY. AW, DIGNITY'S NOT AN ISSUE HERE. THE MAN EATS ALONE IN A RESTAURANT. SO DO I. EXACTLY. HI. HI. UH... JANE, THIS IS CLAUDIA. CLAUDIA, JANE. HI. HI. JANE'S IN THE SAME DANCE CLASS AS SONJA AND I. OH. I'LL GET GOING. SAY HI TO SONJA. SEE YOU. SORRY. WAS THAT REALLY AWKWARD? NO. NO, IT'S FINE. HOW ARE YOU? I'M GOOD. YEAH. GOOD, GOOD. BUT, LOOK, I'D BETTER GO. JANE, UH... MMM. WHERE'D YOU FIND IT? UH... [BELL RINGS] [BELL RINGS] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Nik: PAULA. Paula: UH-HUH? THERE'S AN UNMARKED POLICE CAR IN FRONT OF JANE'S PLACE. SO? WHAT, IS SHE SEEING A COP NOW? DON'T BE NOSY. ARE HER AND PETE GETTING BACK TOGETHER OR WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, WHAT IF THEY ARE? WHAT DO I SAY THEN? NOTHING. WELL, HE'S-- HE'S A MATE OF MINE. DO HIM A FAVOR AND STAY OUT OF IT, ALL RIGHT? BABY ASLEEP? YEAH. [LEON MOANING] AW, SHIT. UHH. UHH. SHIT. OH, FUCK. SORRY. SORRY. IT'S OK. DON'T STOP. DON'T STOP, DON'T STOP. [BOTH MOANING] OHH! UHH, UHH. LEON? UHH, UHH. FUCK. YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT IS IT? WHAT IS IT? UHH. IT'S NOTHING. SHOULD I CALL-- WHAT--WHAT-- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I JUST GET THIS-- SHOULD I GET A DOCTOR? NO. I GET THIS-- I GET THIS PAIN IN MY CHEST SOMETIMES. YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD'VE TOLD ME THAT YOU'VE GOT A WEAK HEART. UHH. I DON'T. THAT'S NOT SOME PERSON I WANT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH-- FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! I DON'T HAVE A WEAK HEART, ALL RIGHT? THIS IS NOT AN AFFAIR. IT'S A ONE-NIGHT STAND, EXCEPT IT HAPPENED TWICE. [SIGHS] OH, SHIT. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. IT'S OK. UHH. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTS] DO YOU EVER WORRY THAT WE DON'T MAKE LOVE VERY OFTEN? NO. I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT THAT MUCH. WHY NOT? I LOVE YOU. WHETHER WE MAKE LOVE 3 TIMES A WEEK OR ONCE A MONTH DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE THAT. DOESN'T IT? IS THIS A TEST? NO. I JUST-- I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. WHY DO WOMEN ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THAT? [FOOTSTEPS] YOU'RE UP LATE. YEAH. I WAS TRYING TO FINISH THIS. AHEM. YOU WANT ONE? I'VE GOT ONE. WHAT'S WRONG? NOTHING. I JUST HAD A SHIT OF A DAY. I STOPPED OFF AND HAD A DRINK WITH CLAUDIA. YEAH, I KNOW. I PHONED HER. I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WERE WORKING LATE. GOOD NIGHT. [BREATHING HEAVILY] OOH! AAH! UHH! FUCK! FUCK! AAH! AHH. AAH! FUCKING STUPID BASTARD! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WILL YOU FUCKING LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING? FUCKING IDIOT! AAH! FUCK. OH, FUCK. HEY. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I'M SORRY. LOOK, HERE'S YOUR BAG. [SHIVERING] JESUS. [SOBBING] Sonja: WHAT HAPPENED? I FELL. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S NOTHING. Sonja: HERE. LET ME LOOK. [SIGHS] I'M ALL RIGHT. NO, YOU'RE NOT. LOOK, I SAID I'M ALL RIGHT! [WATER RUNNING] Patrick: I KEEP THINKING ABOUT HER. ARE YOU FEELING GUILTY? DO YOU THINK I SHOULD BE? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK. HE FEELS MANIPULATED BY HER. HOW? SHE'S VERY NEEDY. ARE YOU TRYING TO JUSTIFY HIS DECEIT? NO, I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT, THAT'S ALL. IT'S--IT'S COMPLEX. MM-HMM, BUT IT'S STILL AN ACT OF DECEIT, ISN'T IT? NO MARRIAGE CAN BE BASED ON THAT. [LAUGHS] MOST MARRIAGES ARE BASED ON THAT, VALERIE. YOU THINK YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN MOST MARRIAGES? WHAT, BECAUSE I'M GAY, I CAN'T HAVE AN OPINION ON THE STATE-- THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY. SHE'S NOT THE VICTIM IN THIS, VALERIE. SHE CHOSE TO MARRY HIM. NOT KNOWING HE WAS GAY. BUT THERE'S KNOWING, AND THERE'S KNOWING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I THINK SOME WOMEN... LIKE TO LIVE THE LIE. IT'S EASIER THAN DEALING WITH THE TRUTH. MAYBE SHE LOVES HIM. BUT SO DO I. THEN HE HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE. UNLESS ONE OF US WITHDRAWS FROM THE CONTEST. IS LOVE A CONTEST FOR YOU, PATRICK? PATRICK. YES. SOMETIMES. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD? I BUMPED IT ON THE CLOTHESLINE. LISTEN, UH... THANKS FOR LAST NIGHT. [SIGHS] I'LL LIE FOR YOU TO ANYONE EXCEPT SONJA. I'VE DONE IT ONCE. I WON'T DO IT AGAIN. FAIR ENOUGH. WHY ARE YOU TRYING SO HARD TO FUCK UP YOUR LIFE AT THE MOMENT? YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO HAVE THE MARRIAGE YOU'VE GOT. AND YOU'RE PISSING ALL OVER IT. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MEN SINGING IN SPANISH] [INAUDIBLE] IT'S GREAT YOUR HUSBAND COMES WITH YOU. YEAH. [BOTH LAUGH] WHAT ABOUT YOURS? OH, I'M SEPARATED. AH. CAN YOU TELL? NO, NO. YOU JUST HAVE THIS KIND OF LOOK. OH, WHAT, DESPERATE? NO. FULL OF POTENTIAL. [SIGHS] [MUSIC STOPS] SORRY, I'M LATE. JANE, THIS IS MY HUSBAND LEON. HI. YEAH. HI. EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY. THERE IS A SALSA BAND PLAYING TONIGHT AND TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE LATIN. LEON, SONJA, ARE YOU GUYS COMING? ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE A NICE QUIET DINNER TOGETHER. COME ON, LEON.

NO. SORRY, MATE. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER. MATE, IF YOU THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW, YOU'D TELL ME, WOULDN'T YOU? BECAUSE IF SHE'S SEEING SOMEONE, YOU KNOW, I'D WANT TO KNOW. IT'D JUST BE EASIER. OF COURSE. I HATE THIS. THANKS, MATE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. TAKE CARE. [DOG BARKS] SO, WHY DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND SPLIT? UM... I DON'T KNOW. I JUST TURNED AROUND ONE DAY, AND I REALIZED THAT I WAS LIVING WITH A MAN THAT I JUST DIDN'T LOVE ANYMORE. IT WAS THAT SIMPLE? [LAUGHS] NO. BUT YOU KNEW THAT MUCH. MAYBE MY EXPECTATIONS WERE TOO HIGH. YOU'RE A BRAVE WOMAN. YOU ARE. MOST PEOPLE SETTLE FOR LESS. I REALLY LIKE YOU, LEON. MAYBE A LITTLE TOO MUCH. [STROKES LEG] BUT I'M... I'M STARTING TO WONDER JUST... WHERE THIS MIGHT GO. I'M STILL IN LOVE WITH MY WIFE, JANE. [LAUGHS] RIGHT. I'M SORRY. SO... WHY--WHY... SO WHY HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING ME IF YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH YOUR WIFE? I DON'T KNOW. IT ISN'T... IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I PLANNED. [LAUGHS] LOOK, JANE, I... YOU KNOW, THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO END BADLY. JUST GO. JUST GO. GO. IT'S TWOFOLD, ACTUALLY. HE THINKS HE RUNS THE FACULTY, BUT HE HASN'T PUBLISHED ANYTHING DECENT SINCE ABOUT 1985. YOU SEEM PREOCCUPIED. I--I'M HAVING TROUBLE WITH A CLIENT. I'M NOT HANDLING HIM VERY WELL. REFER HIM ON. I FIND HIM A LITTLE THREATENING. WHY? I DON'T LIKE... WHAT HE'S DOING. ARE YOU JUDGING HIM? DARLING, YOU HAVE TO REFER HIM ON. I'LL SEE YOU OUTSIDE. EXCUSE ME. I HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO US. I HATE IT. I... WE DON'T TALK ANYMORE. WE LOST OUR DAUGHTER. THAT COULD'VE BROUGHT US CLOSER. DO YOU THINK ABOUT HER VERY MUCH? OF COURSE I DO. I JUST DON'T NEED TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT IT. DO YOU THINK I DID THE WRONG THING? [SIGHS] I JUST--I WANTED THE WHOLE... WORLD TO KNOW. [JOHN GRUNTING] LOOK AT ME, JOHN. LOOK AT ME. UNH.

YOU SURE THERE ISN'T A BILL OR SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO CLEAR? IT'S FINE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THE OFFER'S THERE. Baby: AH! THANKS. IT'S ALL RIGHT. AH! [BIRD SCREECHES] WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP? I THOUGHT YOU COULD DO WITH THE REST. I'LL GO HAVE MY SHOWER. ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT AN EARLY START. I'LL ONLY BE 10 MINUTES. JUST TAKE YOUR OWN CAR. OH, COME ON, WAIT FOR ME, PLEASE? JESUS. SORRY. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I HAVE A LECTURE TONIGHT, ANYWAY. SO YOU'LL BE HOME LATE? YEAH. BYE. I THINK HE'S... HAVING AN AFFAIR. HE'S DISTANT, PREOCCUPIED-- LIKE HE'S HOLDING SOMETHING BACK FROM ME. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF HE WAS? I-I...I THINK I'D LEAVE. [SIGHS] YEAH. AND DOES THAT SCARE YOU? YEAH. I'M--I'M... I'M MIDDLE-AGED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE OUT THERE. YOU KNOW? AND I HAVE THESE 2... BEAUTIFUL BOYS, YOU KNOW. BUT I, UM, I WOULD SURVIVE... IF I HAD TO. MM-HMM. I LIKE BEING THIS AGE, AND I... I LIKE THE LINES AROUND MY EYES. I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES, BUT... I DO. HEH. IT ISN'T-- IT'S NOT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SLEPT WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, YOU KNOW? IT'S...THAT HE MIGHT NOT TELL ME. THAT WOULD BE THE BETRAYAL. DO YOU STILL LOVE HIM? [CELL PHONE RINGS] [RINGS] [RINGS] Secretary: VALERIE? PATRICK PHELAN IS HERE. ALL RIGHT. GIVE ME A MINUTE, OK? YOU DON'T LIKE ME, DO YOU, VALERIE? IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU THAT I LIKE YOU? WOULD IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF I WAS STRAIGHT? I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR SEXUALITY. BUT IT IS A PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A MARRIED MAN. YOU MUST STOP TRYING TO MAKE ME THE SUBJECT. IT'S JUST ANOTHER FORM OF DEFENSE. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR ROLE IN THIS TRIANGLE. MY ROLE? I'M, UH, A RESPITE FROM A MARRIAGE THAT'S GOTTEN TOO HARD. HOW? HE TAKES REFUGE IN ME. IN WHAT I OFFER HIM. WHAT DO YOU OFFER HIM? HEH. SEX UNENCUMBERED BY NEED. WHY DOESN'T HE LEAVE HER? GOOD MEN DON'T KNOW HOW TO LEAVE THEIR WIVES. GOOD MEN OR COWARDLY MEN? HE TOLD ME THAT MAKING LOVE TO HER WAS LIKE TRYING TO FILL AN EMPTY WELL. OH, MY GOD. WHAT'D YOU SAY? WHAT? YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME. NO, I DIDN'T. YES, YOU DID! YOU SAID SOMETHING TO ME. I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. YOU HEARD HIM, DIDN'T YOU? DIDN'T YOU? THIS MAN SAID SOMETHING TO ME. THIS IS BULLSHIT! I DIDN'T-- BULLSHIT? YEAH. I WANT YOUR NAME. GIVE ME YOUR NAME! I WANT YOUR NAME!

HE GETS HOME LATE, HIS WIFE'S NOT THERE. SHE'S LEFT MESSAGES ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE SAYING SHE'S RUN OFF THE ROAD. SHE'S MAKING THE CALLS FROM A PHONE BOX ABOUT 2 Ks DOWN THE ROAD.

THERE'S A TELEPHONE BOX SEVERAL KILOMETERS FURTHER ALONG. DID THEY GO THERE? WE'RE CONDUCTING A SEARCH THERE RIGHT NOW, BUT, UH... IF SHE ACCEPTED A LIFT FROM SOMEBODY ELSE, IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SHE'LL STILL BE THERE. WOULD YOU MIND ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS? I'VE BEEN THROUGH ALL THIS WITH THE POLICE. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO PUT YOU TO ANY MORE TROUBLE, BUT WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT? I GOT HOME AROUND MIDNIGHT. HER CAR WASN'T HERE. I CAME IN, I CHECKED THE MACHINE. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF CALLS. THE LAST MESSAGE SAID THAT THERE WAS A CAR COMING AND SHE WAS GONNA WAVE IT DOWN. AND THAT'S WHEN YOU CALLED THE POLICE. NO, I WAITED ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THAT'S HOW LONG IT WOULD'VE TAKEN-- RIGHT, SO YOU CALLED THE POLICE AT ABOUT 20 MINUTES PAST 12:00. YEAH, I THINK SO. MORE OR LESS. MR. KNOX, DO YOU HAVE A PHOTO OF YOUR WIFE THAT WE COULD HAVE, PLEASE? THANK YOU. HOW WAS YOUR WIFE YESTERDAY? FINE. NOTHING TROUBLING HER? NO. MR.

SHE MENTIONED SHE WAS HAVING SOME SORT OF TROUBLE WITH A CLIENT THE OTHER NIGHT. WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE? SHE DIDN'T GO INTO IT. SHE DOESN'T USUALLY TALK ABOUT HER CLIENTS. WHY NOT? IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL. EVEN BETWEEN A HUSBAND AND A WIFE? YES. I TELL MY WIFE EVERYTHING. THAT SURPRISES ME. WHY? MOST MEN HOLD SOMETHING BACK. YOU'RE SOME KIND OF ACADEMIC, AREN'T YOU? I'M DEAN OF LAW. I STUDIED AT HARVARD. THAT'S WHERE VALERIE AND I MET. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE'D GET INTO A CAR WITH A STRANGER. WELL, MAYBE SHE DIDN'T. MAYBE SHE KNEW HIM. HOW'S YOUR MARRIAGE BEEN LATELY, JOHN? IT'S FINE. HOW'S YOURS? UP AND DOWN. WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY NIGHT? AM I A SUSPECT IN MY WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE? WHERE WERE YOU FRIDAY NIGHT, JOHN? I WAS AT WORK. CAN ANYBODY VERIFY THAT? NO, I WAS ALONE. NOBODY SAW ME. 9 TIMES OUT OF 10 WHEN THE WIFE GOES MISSING, THE HUSBAND KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU'RE A PRICK. THE YOUNG CONSTABLE WILL GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME. Patrick on tape: ANYWAY, WE'VE, UM, BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER FOR A WHILE. Valerie on tape: AND YOU LIKE HIM. YES, I DO. VERY MUCH. SO? [PATRICK SIGHS] HE COMES ENCUMBERED. WITH A WIFE. [TURNS TAPE OFF] [RADIO CHATTERS SOFTLY] [FOOTSTEPS] DON'T YOU HAVE A HOME TO GO TO? YES. DO YOU? MM. YOU FIND ANYTHING? SHE DEDICATED THE BOOK TO JOHN, "FOR TEACHING ME TO TRUST AGAIN." YOU LISTEN TO PHELAN'S TAPES? YEAH. WHAT'D YOU THINK? SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE MAN. GO ON HOME. WE'VE GOT AN EARLY START. WHAT ABOUT YOU? SOON. OK. YOU REALLY DO LOOK LIKE SHIT. GO HOME. THANK YOU. TALK TO THE MYSTERY MAN YET? HE NEVER CAME BACK. AH. SILLY BUGGER. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [DOOR OPENS] [KEYS JINGLING] I'M NOT ASLEEP. DID YOU WATCH THE NEWS? YES. WILL YOU FIND HER? WELL, IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. I SAW HER CLIENT LIST, SONJA. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? BECAUSE...IT WAS PRIVATE. IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I HAD TO DO. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO PRIVATE BETWEEN YOU AND ME. THAT IS BECAUSE I HAD SOMEBODY I COULD TALK TO, AND-- I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. I HAVE TO TELL YOU. I HAD AN AFFAIR. I SLEPT WITH HER TWICE. I KNOW IT HURTS YOU. IT...HURTS HER. WHY? BECAUSE I'M NUMB. I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING ANYMORE. JUST... JUST TOTALLY FUCKIN' NUMB. [INSECTS BUZZING] [DOG BARKING] WHY'D YOU SLEEP ON THE COUCH? OH, I COME IN LATE LAST NIGHT, DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOUR MUM UP. ARE YOU FIGHTING? YEAH, A BIT. WHY? LOOK, MATE, SOMETHING WE'VE GOT TO SORT OUT, ALL RIGHT? YOU ALL RIGHT, MUM? I'LL BE IN THE CAR. BUDDY, CAN YOU GRAB SOMETHING TO EAT, PLEASE? WE'RE RUNNING LATE. LOOK, ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS? WHAT, YOU'RE JUST GONNA PUNISH ME? THIS IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA PUNISH ME? I FUCKED UP, ALL RIGHT? PEOPLE FUCK UP. REALLY? WELL, I DON'T. YOU KNOW, IT'S SO EASY, LEON, SO EASY TO GO OUT AND FIND SOMEBODY. YOU KNOW WHAT'S HARD? WHAT'S HARD IS NOT TO. SONJA, LISTEN. I JUST WANT TO-- GET OFF ME! GOD. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? OH. GET FUCKED! I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'LL BE HERE LATER. [DOOR SLAMS] HI. DID YOU KNOW? [SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] [ENGINE STARTS] [TIRES SQUEAL] YOU READY? [CHILD CHATTERING] [CHILD CALLS OUT] [DIALING] HEY. IT'S ME. HEY, CAN YOU COME OVER? [BRAKES SQUEAK] WHAT NUMBER IS IT? 406. YOU SURE YOU'RE UP TO THIS? [DOOR UNLOCKS] MR. PHELAN? WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VALERIE SOMERS, AND WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU CAN HELP US. IT'S--IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME. AHEM. I WAS OUT LATE. WHO WITH? [GRUNTS] MR. PHELAN, THE WOMAN IS MISSING. [SIGHS] DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER? NOT YET. YOU HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH HER? CAN YOU TELL US HOW SHE WAS? [SIGHS] SHE SEEMED ALL RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW? WELL, SHE'S THE THERAPIST. I WASN'T THAT FOCUSED ON HOW SHE WAS. HOW'D YOU GET ON WITH HER? FINE. THAT'S IT? FINE? WE DIDN'T END OUR LAST SESSION ON VERY GOOD TERMS. OH, YEAH? WHY'S THAT? WE DISAGREED ABOUT SOMETHING. WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT? WHAT, THAT GUY YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING? MARRIED GUY? HOW'D YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? SHE RECORDS ALL HER SESSIONS. YES, BUT WHAT IS SAID IN THAT ROOM IS-- YES, BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES-- THAT'S MY LIFE! IS THERE SOMEBODY IN THAT ROOM? [SIGHS] WHO IS IT, THEN? IS IT YOUR BOYFRIEND? COULD YOU ASK HIM TO COME OUT, PLEASE? HE HAS NOTHING TO DO-- COULD YOU ASK HIM-- HE'S NOT-- WHAT'S THE MATTER LEON! WITH YOU? YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THIS! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? YOU DON'T HAVE THE FUCKING RIGHT! FINISHED? [DING] THAT WENT WELL. LEON, YOUR MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART, AND SO ARE YOU. IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, CLAUDIA. IT IS MY--BULLSHIT! IT IS MY BUSINESS IF YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB! HEY, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY I'M HANDLING THINGS, TAKE IT UP WITH THE STATION. [RATTLES DOOR] PUSH. [OPENS DOOR] [VEHICLE SQUEAKING] [WINGS FLAPPING] [TELEPHONE DIALS] [LINE RINGS] [TELEPHONE RINGS] [RING] [BEEP] HELLO? Leon: HI, DYLAN? HI, DAD. Leon: COULD I-- COULD I SPEAK TO YOUR MOM? NO, SHE'S STILL PISSED OFF WITH YOU. YEAH, RIGHT. UM... LOOK, TELL HER, UH... TELL HER I'LL BE HOME SOON. RIGHT. SEE YOU, DAD. [BEEP] WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID TO SAY THAT HE'S SORRY, THAT HE LOVES YOU, AND HE WANTS YOU TO STOP BEING ANGRY WITH HIM. [SIGHS] [SIGNAL CLICKING] [BRAKES SQUEAK] YOU LOOK BEREFT, LEON. THE QUESTION IS, WHY DON'T YOU? DON'T BE DECEIVED BY APPEARANCES. WANT A WHISKEY? SOMEBODY MAY HAVE HURT YOUR WIFE, JOHN. AND I NEED TO KNOW IF IT WAS YOU. I DIDN'T HURT HER. SHE WAS UPSET ON THE PHONE. SHE WAS AFRAID. OF WHAT? OF BEING ALONE. OF ME NOT BEING THERE FOR HER. WHY WEREN'T YOU THERE FOR HER? WHEN YOUR WIFE WAS IN SOME PHONE BOX CALLING FOR YOUR HELP, WHERE WERE YOU? WERE YOU SEEING SOMEONE ELSE? IS IT AN AFFAIR, IS THAT IT? NO. WITH A MAN? IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON? I BELIEVE THAT THAT'S WHAT VALERIE THOUGHT WAS GOING ON. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? FOR SOME REASON, SHE BELIEVED THAT YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR WHERE YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH PATRICK PHELAN. IS THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN YOUR MARRIAGE? WERE YOU SEEING MEN ON THE SIDE? I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS. YES, YOU DO. MY WIFE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? TRYING TO FIND HER, JOHN. BUT I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE HER HEAD. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. HAVE YOU EVER CHEATED ON YOUR WIFE? [PUTS GLASS DOWN] NO. NEVER DESIRED ANOTHER WOMAN? YES, OF COURSE I HAVE. BUT YOU NEVER ACTED ON IT. NO. WELL, YOU'RE A BETTER MAN THAN I AM. SO THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE? NO. THERE WAS SOMEONE ONCE. A WOMAN. ONCE THAT'S HAPPENED, YOU'RE NEVER ENTIRELY BELIEVED AGAIN. SOMETHING GETS BROKEN... PERMANENTLY. TRUST, I SUPPOSE. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, IT WOULD SEEM. YOU DON'T LOSE A DAUGHTER LIKE WE LOST ELEANOR... WITHOUT SOME DAMAGE. SO WHERE WERE YOU? I LEFT WORK LATE. I STOPPED AT THE PLACE WHERE MY DAUGHTER WAS KILLED. I GO THERE...A LOT. VALERIE DIDN'T KNOW THAT. YOU DIDN'T TELL HER? WHY NOT, JOHN? WHAT HOLDS YOUR MARRIAGE TOGETHER, LEON? AH... LOYALTY. LOVE. MAYBE HABIT, SOMETIMES PASSION, AND I HAVE KIDS. OURS WAS HELD TOGETHER BY GRIEF. THERE WASN'T MUCH ELSE LEFT. SO ARE YOU SAYING YOU DIDN'T LOVE HER ANYMORE? I'M SAYING THAT SOMETIMES LOVE ISN'T ENOUGH. [DOOR CLOSES] Claudia: LEON! WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? WE'VE HAD A CALL FROM A MAN SAYING THAT HIS WIFE SAW HER NEIGHBOR THROW A SHOE INTO A VACANT LOT ON THE NIGHT VALERIE DISAPPEARED. SHE'S GOT THE SHOE-- BLACK LEATHER. WHERE WE GOING?
