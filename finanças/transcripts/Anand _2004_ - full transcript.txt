Writers in our country are improving day by day. In the past they used to come for the literary meet on cycles but now they turn up in cars. Yes, yes. I owned a cycle too last year but I had to sell it off to publish my novel. - Let's go. - Yes. Respected Chairman, Dr. Baneriee Dr. Kulkarni and gentlemen I thank Rustomji Petit Trust through this literary association for announcing the Saraswati Award and encouraging the writers. This award is given to the best book of the year. This year the most amazing fact is that this is the writer's first work. And the writer's a doctor: Dr Bhaskar Banerjee. He's not only famous in his medical field and in alcohol Please just mention the medicine. Forgive me. Dr. Baneriee's well known for his medicines and not for alcohol. He's a remarkable cancer specialist. In spite of being surrounded by such situations writing a novel like Anand is quite astonishing. Before I give the award, can I ask Dr Banerjee to say a few words about his novel, Anand. Where and how did he find the inspiration to write it? I Excuse me but I don't know what to say. Frankly, I'm no writer. My habit of writing begins and ends with my diary and what you assume to be my story or novel is just a few extracts from my diary. If you feel that Anand is fiction or my imagination that shows a fault in my writing. It constitutes a failure on my part. Anand loved to make friends. Every place he went, he was in search of a friend. That's why I published my novel: so that his friendliness would spread throughout the world. When I first met Anand, my mind wasn't stable. I was ill at ease with the medical profession. I'd seen all kinds of disease, poverty and disaster and I'd lost all hope in life. I was helpless. I could combat disease but what could I do about hunger and poverty? I tried to fight them, but didn't have the right weapons. I noticed that many thousands of people lack vitamins but when they're starving, what's the use of vitamins? Medicine can cure disease but not poverty and after so many years of independence people still don't have the money to buy salt. How can I ask them to buy medicines? - Doctor - It's not in my hands. - Doctor, please do something. - What can I do? Am I God? Go and pray. Doctor, have some sweets. Laxmi had a baby boy: my grandson. Someone just died and another's born, ready for death. I admit, life's stronger than death but isn't this life worse than death? When I took my degree from college, I vowed to save lives and now at every step I feel I'm trying to save death. Munna, won't you have your meals? You have it, uncle. If I feel like it, I'll eat later. What kind of a doctor are you? Your father was a doctor too. He used to work day and night, but he never ignored food. He made money too and bought this property. You're not concerned with making money. You just work hard. Your friend Prakash has built such a large hospital. Uncle Raghu, leave me alone. - Will you do me a favour? - What? Bring a daughter-in-law into this house. Then I'll go back to my village. I mean it. I've brought you up so I can't watch your condition or leave you alone. Hey, Uncle Raghu. Come on. Serve me some food. It's better than marriage. Park the car up ahead. - Hello, doctor. - Please wait. I'm examining him. - I'm in a hurry. - You can come tomorrow. Fine. I'll wait, then. Take this address and get an X-Ray done. Do I need an X-Ray? I'm giving two more music lessons so my throat must have torn and it's bleeding now. Anything could have happened, but go and get an X-Ray done. - What's happened? - Nothing, but the X-Ray - You know my situation. - You won't have to pay. I'll call him. Dr. Prakash Kulkarni. Go and meet him. Doctor, have my reports come? Yes. Please be seated. You're perfectly fine. - You look disappointed. - No. Dr. Kulkarni mentioned that you're a cancer expert. Expert in what? In giving cancer or curing it? It's all right, doctor. But I've developed a new complication. I can't get sleep and I feel tired during the day. Give me some good medicine. You love taking medicine, don't you? If I give you some colourful capsules or tablets or tell you about a medicine that's unavailable you'll be satisfied and think I'm a good doctor. If you can give me some medicine, then do. Otherwise there's no lack of doctors. Please leave. What are your consultation fees? I take fees for medicines, not for giving some sense. Dr. Kulkarni, please. Dr. Banerjee. Prakash, it's Bhaskar here. I'm sending a boy over for an X-Ray. His name's Ranjit. Examine him. Do you have any samples of streptomycin? Keep some for me. Whose letter? Trivedi the gynaecologist from Delhi. He's writing after a long time. Yes. I'm going to the laboratory in the afternoon and I'll be there by 4.00 p.m. OK? - Sister. - Good morning, Dr. Banerjee. - Is Dr. Kulkarni in? - Yes, he's waiting for you. Remember, Mrs. Sanyal, take the green and red capsules together and after half an hour, the pink tablets next, the green and yellow capsules and half an hour later, the pink tablets. And yes, the white tablets I prescribed: continue them one in the morning and in the evening. - I'm sorry. - No problem, Bhaskar, come in. Sit down. I forgot to mention one thing. Something's wrong with me these days. - I feel frightened. - Why? I had my blouses stitched last month and they're tight now. It's a sanforized material. No, Mrs. Sanyal. Don't neglect it. I want to check your blood cholesterol. Come next Saturday. Oh no, not Saturday. I have a kitty party. - Can't I come on Friday? - Friday... Let me check. - Fine. Friday morning, 9.00 a.m. - OK. Here's the cheque for last month: 500 rupees. - Thank you. - Eh! - I mean for this cheque. - It's all right, doctor. Goodbye. Come over, Bhaskar. Please be seated. You're telling her about blood cholesterol. What does she know? You'll always remain a doctor. If I don't create an impression, how will she gain confidence? Yes. I know what you'd have told her, if she'd come to you. The same thing you told Chandranath and made him angry: "Walk for two hours in the morning and play for two hours in the evening." After 15 days she wouldn't need either you or me. She'd be playing badminton leisurely and we'd be begging on the streets. If you wanted to do this, why did you pass your medical study? You could have opened a shop. If I sold milk, I'd mix water into it and if I were a lawyer I'd take money from the conflict and try to save him. In this profession I can reduce their stomach ache or toothache. Do you think this is right? There's nothing wrong with it, Bhaskar. The boy you sent for an X-Ray this morning Yes, what happened? There's a patch of T.B. on his left lung. I told him to come and get an injection every day. Do you think he can afford it? For treatments like this, I have to take money from Mrs. Sanyal. She's not paying for nothing. I know she's not sick but she has doubts about her health. I cure these doubts. What's wrong with that? I understand, Prakash but don't you think there's something wrong somewhere? Forget it. You won't understand and I can't make you. This is Trivedi's letter and he's sent a case history. A case history? Whose? Read it. He's got a friend, Anand Sehgal. I met him five years ago in Delhi. We became good friends and he's very jovial. - What's wrong with him? - Lymphosarcoma of the intestine. Lymphosarcoma. Have they done a biopsy? What's the use of sending him here? Doesn't Trivedi know, there's no cure? He knows, but Anand hasn't got anyone and he's still in the ambulatory stage. He can move around and wants to see Bombay and he wants to meet us. The treatment given there can be given here too. This is his X-Ray. Have a look. What's there to see? In a few months there'll be distention of stomach and the tumor will burst or there'll be acute anaemia and he can't breathe. He'll hardly live for four to six months. Sir, one Mr. Anand Sehgal has arrived. Anand from Delhi. He was going to come tomorrow. Send him in. Where will he stay? At your home? Yes. I've made arrangements here. Bhaskar. He's Trivedi's best friend. He'll stay for three to four months and leave. - As long as he's here we'll have to - My friend. - Hello, my friend. - Come on, Anand. Come. I told you we'd meet again, didn't I? - Sit down. - I heard you're married. - How's your wife? - Very well. - Any junior, senior? - Not yet. You've been married three years and you don't have a compounder yet. - Go and consult Trivedi. - How's Trivedi? He's having family planning. Two's more than enough. - What about his children? - His children? Yes, two plus three: that's five, which is enough. Five? Anand, meet Dr. Bhaskar Banerjee. Babumushai! Girls called you "Babumushai" in college. Dr. Trivedi's told me everything. I've heard that many girls had a crush on you. What's the situation now? Anand, you were supposed to come tomorrow. All my work's the same. When I was born, the doctor said I'd be born on the 21st, but I came early. If the doctor pronounces the date of my death I'll die early. And yes I've kept my things in your office: my suitcase and a tape recorder. I've got some clothes but no bed. Don't worry. Your bed's ready in the cabin above. You can stay here. I was showing your X-Ray to Dr. Banerjee. Oh, my film show was being held here. Hey, Babumushai What did you find? I'll tell Trivedi. Don't worry about it. It concerns me. Why shouldn't I worry? - What do you want to know? - Tell me the disease. What will you gain by knowing? Nothing, but tell me. If I tell you you've got lymphosarcoma - what will you understand? - What? Repeat it. Lymphosarcoma of the intestine. Splendid! What a name! Sounds like a viceroy's name. What a great disease. You're a great doctor, Babumushai. Wow! What a name. "Lymphosarcoma of the intestine." It sounds like an announcement on the radio. I swear if a woman was suffering from this disease it would sound like she'd adopted an English baby. This is no joke. Do you know what lymphosarcoma means? Do I know the meaning of this disease? There's a dreadful tumour in my stomach and I won't live for more than six months. Maybe that's the medical name for it but why are you so angry all of a sudden? I understand. You're angry, but not with me. With yourself! Because I can't be cured. So much love isn't good. - Can I give you just one examination? - Why? What's wrong with me? - Give me your hand. - The pulse is here. - No chance. What's your age. - 30. 30. If you take 30 away from 100, what's left? - 70. - 70. You won't live past 70. Do you know what your problem is? Your body's slowly deteriorating. What do you mean? What's the difference between 70 years and 6 months? Death comes in a second. But in these 6 months, I'll live every moment. Babumushai, life should be great, not long. You're too much. If you're scared of death... What's the essence of death? As long as I'm alive, I'm not dead. When I'm dead, I'm nothing. So why be scared of death? I'm sorry, sir... Anand. Sir? Babumushai, life's short and time's fleeting. We've got to live fast, and be quick. At least cut down on the details. - What's your opinion? - Fine. He'll do that. Yes, sir. Sister, there's a cabin above. Take him there. I'll be coming. Anand, you'll be examined in two days. Sure. This will be the only examination in which the one who takes it isn't studying but the one who gives it has to. Let's go, sister. Forgive me. Trivedi warned me not to joke with you but what could I do? It's a habit. Really. Bhaskar, he know's he's dying yet he's so lively and Maybe that's why he... What do you think? - Can anything be done? - Nothing. The disease is such Until secondary manifestation, we can't detect anything but by then it'll be too late. Nothing can be done. Keep the things here. If you need anything else, ring the bell. - Where are you going? - I'm on duty. - But who'll take care of me? - I will. Don't worry. Let's sit and talk. I'm all alone. Are you scared of being alone? No, I'm not but I want someone to talk to. Oh! You can do one thing. There's a mirror there. Sit in front of it and talk. I've tried that. It's boring. Our matron will be coming now. meet her. She's very sweet. - What are you doing here? - I was in the cabin. Don't you know the visiting hours? No. I don't. You can't meet with any patient before 4 o'clock. Oh. And if I want to meet the doctor? Go to the office. You know the rules. Sister, can't we break them sometimes? All right, but why should we break the rules? Anand, what are you doing here? Everyone who comes here is asking this. Is this a hospital or a school? A teacher was asking the same question. Now it's the headmaster. Doctor, there isn't any patient in the cabin. The patient is very naughty, sister. You'll have to use a cane to look after him. Anand, meet our matron, Mrs. D'sa. Sister, this is our patient, Anand. Come on, sister. Let's go to the cabin. Come in, sister. Please be seated. So you're the matron. - I heard you talk a lot. - Shut up. Is this how you talk? Didn't you hear me? Lie down quietly. You can't die quietly, sister. You have to make a sound. Out of 24 hours, we spend eight hours sleeping and four hours eating and drinking. 50% is left. If I live for a year, six months will be gone. If I live for six, three months are over. - If I live for three, I'll lose one month. - I said, shut up. OK. Lie down. I told you, lie down. Today I met Anand Sehgal from Delhi. I felt as if a tornado had swept into the room. He laughed and joked every minute even though knowing his death was near. I wonder if he was laughing at death or life. - Is Babumushai in? - Babumushai? - Yes, the doctor. - Yes, he is. Your name? Anand. Tell him, Anand's here. - Mr. Anand. - What did we decide? You tell me. OK. How did you come here? I ran away. What kind of a friend are you? You caged me in there and disappeared. If you want me there you'll have to stay with me. I won't stay on my own. - But you need to. - No, I don't. If I have to live, I have to laugh. I'll fall sick in that nursing home. I haven't come for treatment. I know everything. I've come to meet you folks here. Babumushai, I don't have anyone and neither do you. As long as I'm alive, let me stay here. Yes, you can. But have you told the nursing home? No, I haven't, but I've left a note for the matron. Please call my friend and inform him. - Uncle Raghu, where's your luggage? - In the nursing home. No problems, Uncle Raghu. Take him upstairs. Arrange things in the adjoining room. I'll call Prakash and let him know. Uncle Raghu, sit down. We can check the room Later. Sit down. - Tell me who cooks here? - Me. I hope you cook well. I have two hobbies in life: talking and eating. While I do talk a lot, I eat as well. Can't you see how healthy I am? Come and take me to the kitchen. Come on. Hello. Is Prakash there? Where's he gone? This is Baneriee speaking. At my place, both of them? OK, fine. I'm calling from home. Come on, Prakash. Where's your wife? She's coming. How did you know? - I just called your place. - Really? Hello, sister-in-law. You surprised me. Suman has come to invite you. Invite me? I'm lucky. What's so special? Three years ago I made a mistake and she wants to celebrate. Oh, your wedding anniversary! He's smart. He realised what mistake I meant. He made the mistake but I got caught in it. What? Come in. Come on. Babumushai, your Raghu Kaka has made excellent - I'm caught. - How did you come here? It's not my fault. Babumushai made me. I told him you'd be angry. He said he'd explain and wouldn't say anything. Don't be angry with him. He's all alone. - Yes. I understand. - You do? Meet her. She's Suman, my Hello, sister-in-law. Forgive me, I didn't see you. He's trying to introduce us. Actually I came from Delhi to meet you. - Me! - I had an important task. - What task? - Sing that song you sang before your marriage for my friend. What friend? What a place for a song! Who told you about it? As if you didn't know! You must have told him. I don't like this. You're embarrassing me in front of others. - But I really didn't tell him. - Yes, he didn't tell me. It's astrology. I can do face reading. Your father beat you up before your marriage. - No, never. - Don't lie and don't feel shy. Remember how you'd go to the movies at Metro Cinema and you'd sit in the Kit-Kat restaurant opposite the cinema and have food with my friend. Your father saw you one evening and beat you up. Am I right? Now tell me you didn't reveal anything. Yes, tell her. - Trivedi must have told you. - That means you told Trivedi. No, my dear. What's the use of fighting now? Please sing that song. Please, sister-in-law. - Yes, sister-in-law - Yes, sister-in-law. Why are you calling me "sister-in-law"? I was following the majority. I'm telling the truth. I can't sing. He's just teasing me. Anand, the day after tomorrow is our wedding anniversary - so come with Bhaskar. - I surely will. Sister-in-law, what flowers do you like? I'll get a large bouquet. - You won't be coming. - Why not? - We don't accept gifts. - Do you accept cash? We're not having a party. We're just inviting you. Don't be obliged. I won't be but you'll have to. There should be such a variety of food that my stomach won't be empty. No problem. I'll pack bags of it for you. Very good. - But on one condition. - What? You'll have to sing a song now. - I know you sing well. - How do you know? - The same old astrology. - You mean face reading? Yes. I'm her astrologer. I told her. Come on. Sing now. Anand, please sing. This instrument will have forgotten its tuning. OK. I won't muck around. Empty the seat. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams Some of smiles and some of sorrows Haunting memories, some stolen from your eyes. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams. Small things Small things still live in my memory. I haven't forgotten a single moment past. Small things Small things still live in my memory. I haven't forgotten a single moment past. I've kept waiting for you over so many lifetimes. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams. The nights were disturbed. Sometimes I soothed the disturbed nights. For your sake, sometimes I even invited the morning. The nights were disturbed. Sometimes I soothed the disturbed nights. For your sake, sometimes I even invited the morning. Even knowing you were gone I still kept waiting for you. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams Some of smiles and some of sorrows. Haunting memories, some stolen from your eyes. I've woven colourful dreams for you: A symphony of dreams. Anand, sit in Prakash's office. I'll be there. - When's the matron coming? - Who? Mrs. D'sa? - She's already come. - Then I'm dead. - Why? What happened? - Nothing. Come soon. Hey, fatso. Murarilal, how come you're here? Are you well? Didn't you recognise me? It's Anand. We had beer at the Qutub Minar and we got drunk. How's your jaggery business doing? I'm not Murarilal, and I don't sell jaggery. My name is Chandranath and I sell oil. - So you've started selling oil. - I haven't. It's an ancestral business. So what, Murarilal? Any business is as good as another. I told you, my name is Chandranath. What's in a name? If your name was something else, would you change it? You wouldn't. You'd do the same business and meet me. Come on and shake hands. I'm glad to see you. Are you? So Mr. Chandranath, what's new? There's a new complication, a shifting pain. A shifting pain. I had it too. There's no better doctor. At first I had it here and it shifted up and went out through my head. - Where do you have it? - In my knees. I'll take a long time. Problems. Doctor, isn't there some medicine which will get it out through the feet? Yes, doctor, give me some medicine like that. It's all right. Go to the office and take an admission. - Fine. I'll do that. - Don't worry, Murarilal. My name's not Murarilal! It's Chandranath. Anand, do you want to end my business? Why were you teasing him? Teasing him? No! I was praising you. - May I come in, sir? - Matron! Oh, my God! Come in, Mrs. D'sa. Sir, Dr. Baneriee's waiting for you. Fine. - What are you doing here? - I was praying. - Where did you run away to? - Home. - Home? - Dr. Banerjee's house. - Why didn't you tell me? - I was scared. Do you know, Dr. Kulkarni scolded me because of you? So what? You're scolding me too. - You talk too much. - Yes, I do. That's why I ran away. I can't survive without talking and you told me to lie down quietly. Am I being too strict for my own good? I have to take care of kids like you. Doesn't a mother scold her children? Yes, I realised that later. Why does everyone call you "sister"? They should call you "mother", "mother matron". You'll listen to this mother. - Yes, we're friends now, mother. - Then come to the cabin. No, not to the cabin. I'll perish there on my own. Take me to your house. I'll tie you up. No one can tie me up, mummy. I'll go away by myself. - Good morning, Mrs. D'sa. - Good morning, doctor. Will Anand stay with you? Yes. He doesn't like your nursing home. Wherever he stays, he wins people over. He was just saying, why do people call you "sister"? They should call you "mother matron". He's right. Dr. Baneriee, what's happened to him? He has lymphosarcoma of the intestine. Oh! Is it in the initial stage? Will he be all right? No, sister, he's in the final stage. God bless you. May God bless you with enough children. Naughty. - Who? Me or God? - Aren't you ashamed? What did I say? When one grows up, there'll be a young one - and when he does there'll be another one - Keep quiet. You'll say anything. - You're making fun of God. - You two are still arguing today? - Mrs. D'sa. - Please come in. You didn't invite me but how could I forget your anniversary? Your favourite flowers. No, I'll give it to both of you together, sir. You're very endearing, Mrs. D'sa, you calling me "sir". And her your daughter! I won't call you "sir" today. I'll pray to God for your happiness. God bless you, my dear. - Come over. - No. Bow your head first or else you'll say I'm endearing. Now get ready. Why should I? Only Anand and Bhaskar will be here. - Is Anand coming too? - Yes. - I'll be leaving then. - Why? From the time I heard about his disease, I haven't been able to face him. - What's wrong with him? - Nothing, he'll be all right. - I'll be leaving, sir. - "Sir" again? Oh. I'll leave, my dear. - Please have some sweets. - I have to go to the church. Don't you know, I don't eat unless I've lit the candles. Fine. I'll be leaving. Listen. What's wrong with Anand? He's sick. He'll be fine. Then why was Mrs. D'sa scared to face him? She's like that: a bit sentimental. - She's scared of every patient. - Mrs. D'sa's a strict matron. I'm sure it must be serious. That's why you're hiding. Look. The priest hasn't finished his chanting yet and the bride's besides the groom. Tell me one thing. What treatment is he giving you? - What's wrong with you? - A common cold. Tell me the truth. Don't joke. That's the problem. I told you the Hindi term for it but if I say it in medical terms, like "lymphosarcoma of the nose" - you'll believe me. - You're lying. I'm not your brother. You're my sister-in-law. I'm not. I'm your sister and you're my brother. Fine. From now on I'll call you by your name, "Suman". That's enough, brother-in-law. Have a seat. What's wrong with you all of a sudden? He's been standing such a long time. Sit down. Aren't you ashamed? How will he feel? Suman, he's right. You're my sister and he's my brother-in-law. Let him call me that. Bhaskar, I know you won't lie. Tell me the truth. What's wrong with Anand? Why are you asking him? Doctors don't know anything. Don't worry about me. An astrologer told me I'll survive till 80. I haven't been interviewed yet. So you believe in astrologers as well as sadhus. - Why not? - Will you come with me? I have a tutor. He's a famous sadhu: Mouni Baba, he doesn't talk. Oh, God. I'm dead. Doesn't he ever talk? No. I've sent many people to him. So nowadays all your patients go to him? No wonder he was complaining his business isn't good. - Don't joke. Will you come? - Sure. Your teacher's mine too. Prasad, pray for us. Do you have to tell us? I always pray for you. I've called you my brother, so let me take a blessing from you. Bless me. I'll make you some tea. What can I bless you with? I can't even ask God to give my life to you. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. Then someone knocks on my heart. Someone knocks.

When I begin feeling suffocated and tears suddenly fill my eyes When I begin feeling suffocated and tears suddenly fill my eyes someone unseen gives me a caring and sympathizing touch. Someone unseen. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. Sometimes hearts never meet and sometimes we share a strong relationship. Sometimes hearts never meet and sometimes we share a strong relationship. It's a sweet confusion. Our mind itself becomes our foe. It's our mind but it feels for others. It feels for others. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. My heart knows all my secrets. How I've woven these dreams! My heart knows all my secrets. How I've woven these dreams! They are so dear to me. They'll never leave me. Never. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. Then someone knocks on my heart. Someone knocks. When day sets somewhere in the zenith, dusk appears stealthily and silently. Anand. Hey, Babumushai. When did you come? - Were you listening quietly to my song? - Yes. - Did you like it? - Beautiful, but a little sad. Isn't melancholy beautiful, Babumushai? Yes, but I've always seen you smiling. That's all. Does that mean every smile is full of joy? Sometimes sorrow is too. Anand, you always share your joy with others. Share your sorrow with me today. No, Babumushai. I'll never share it with anyone. Forgive me. I'm selfish with this. Anand suddenly stopped while telling me something. He hid his sorrows from me. Maybe that sorrow is the essence of his life today. Otherwise how is it possible for a man who is deteriorating day by day, to have such a stable mind? I don't know what he's sad about, but I didn't pry. But if this is the power which keeps him alive then let his pains be concealed forever. Take his blessings. Baba, he's my brother. He's sick. Make him well. Hold on, Suman. You're getting your work finished. - Let me talk to Baba first. - How can you talk to him? Didn't I tell you he doesn't speak? He's vowed not to. You did. But, Baba have you taken a life-long oath? Won't you ever speak? I'm dead. I'll never be able to talk to you. Tell me, Baba, doesn't it bother you to stay silent? I'd die if I stayed silent for five minutes. Don't waste his time. Baba, bless my brother. I'm sure if you wish it he'll get well. - Can he do that? - Yes, he can. Baba, can you do something to make me live for 200 years and as long as I live no disease can affect me. I won't fall sick and the thermometers of all my doctor friends will stand still. - What does that mean? - What's dying is my body. Baba, then why should I ask you for such a small thing? The thing that's dying is my body. Bless my mind so that I'll smile and make others smile too. Baba, bless me to make me talk as much as I can. Let me talk good about others and not bad even by mistake. Will you do that, Baba? Why don't you leave the onions alone? Why are you after it I'm not. It's after me. It made me cry. Why did you come into the kitchen? I'll do that. - Go to your room. - You can push me out now but you won't be able to, when she comes and takes over. That day isn't in my fate. I'm not talking about you, Uncle Raghu. I'm talking about Munna. That's what I was saying. Can I get married at this age? - Why don't you get him married? - But he needs to agree. Find a good girl for him. I'll make him. He won't listen. A nice lady used to come here. She doesn't any more. Who was she? She was nice and I think Munna liked her too but you know how he is. Tell me. Will any girl propose to a man? - Never. - Set a wedding date. Bring a priest over and catch Munna and get him married. - Will that ever happen? - No, never. Munna doesn't understand. He's doing a service to society and never bothers about himself. Babumushai, what are you doing on your own? Come on. Let's go out. - Where? - Anywhere. Come on. Let's go. Come on. No one can argue with you. - But not in your car. - How then? From here to Victoria Terminus and the terminus to Victoria. - That means a horse carriage. - Why? Victoria has its own grandeur. It will feel as though the ancient rich are arriving like some Raibahadur Murarikhan Sharif from Lucknow. Come on, Babumushai. Let's go. You'll have to wait an hour for the bus. So what, Babumushai? Murarilal. - Hey, Murarilal. - What? Don't you recognise me? We had beer at Qutub Minar and got drunk. You're mistaken. I've never been to Delhi. Your memory is very weak. I'm telling the truth. My name isn't Murarilal. It's Jagdish. I have a friend named Murarilal and he looks like you. So what? I've met another Murarilal on this pretext. Shake hands. I'm glad to meet you. Aren't you? - Yes. - Don't forget me. Go on now. Goodbye. Anand, you should have checked whether he was Murarilal or not. I don't know anyone by the name of Murarilal. So what? I felt like meeting him and I met him. Do you ever feel that you don't know a person who's helped you and yet you never liked him? Yes. At times you may meet a person who's never helped you, and yet you like him. - Yes, but why? - Yes, tell me why. Because he... I'll tell you. Every human body is a transmitter and a receiver. There was a vibration from Jagdish's body and I received it. That's it. That's a great theory, Babumushai. If you do research, you'll win a Noble prize. - What's this craziness? - Babumushai, you call this crazy? You meet a man, make friends and touch him. What else do you need? Look. There's one more, Murarilal. - Where are you going? Stand here. - Babumushai, Murarilal. Sir, please buy some flowers for your wife. Babumushai, shall I buy them for my sister-in-law? - Yes, let's. - Give me two fragrant ones. - I get them from the gardens, sir. - What, garlands? Yes. - No, flowers. - Say that. Here. Hey, Babumushai. - You're very smart. - What? I mean Mr. Smart. If I hadn't bought these flowers, you'd never tell me. Tell me. Who is she? Where does she live? Who are you talking about? I thought it was for Suman. Don't evade it. Tell me where she lives and who she is. - Who are you talking about? - The girl you have - your continuity with. - My continuity! What continuity? It's love in Hindi as well as Bengali. I'm not in love. Can't you tell me. Ladies and gentleman, there are young men who - know nothing about love. - Anand! - What are you doing! - Then tell me. - There's nothing to reveal. - Lies again. - Ladies and gentleman - You're blackmailing me. You'll have to tell me. - Tell you what? - Who is she? There must be someone who makes your heart beat. Babumushai, your eyes show that there's someone. Babumushai, tell me please. You know that I She was my patient and was suffering from pneumonia. While I gave her treatment - I understand. What's her name? - Renu. - Where does she live? - She teaches in a school. - Did you kiss her? - What! - Did you ever kiss her? - You rogue! - What are you so shy about? - Anand, don't be silly. This is exotic Bengali love. Love should be like that. Who is it? Greetings! _ Is the doctor in? - Yes, he is. - Can you call him? - Sure. Please have a seat. Sit down. Tell me what your problem is. Don't worry. Our doctor's a magician. The moment he touches them, a patient gets up and starts playing cricket. But you're a girl. You'll play badminton. You're laughing. I'm telling you the truth. You won't find a doctor like him. Anand, who are you talking to? - Renu! Are you here? - I'm dead. What do you mean, dead? Renu, he's my best friend, Anand. - Babumushai, isn't she that continuity one? - Anand. The one for whom your heart beats and over whom you spend sleepless nights? - Anand! What's going on? - No, you didn't tell me but - Renuji, you teach at a school. - Yes. - You suffered from pneumonia. - Yes. - And he cured you? - Yes. How do I know? He told me everything. - He's very shy and timid. - Anand. Sorry. I can't call her my sister-in-law as yet. Why are you yelling at me? You're in love with the girl and you can't tell her! - Will you please shut up! - Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes. When Salim and Anarkali are quiet about it... Mughal-E-Azam's doing the talking. But Renuji, I'm telling the truth. He's in love with you. I'm leaving now. I hope you didn't believe Anand. No. Why didn't you? He was speaking the truth. About something I couldn't reveal but my friend has done that. Renu, if these feelings aren't mutual, tell me so that I won't be embarrassed later. Your friend was right. You really are timid. That's it. Everything was perfect. Now that Anand has broken the ice I feel like revealing all that's been pent up in my heart. Do then. Let's go out. Shall we? Are you going somewhere? Yes, Anand. We were going for a walk. Will you join us? What are you gaping at? Will you join us? Yes, I'll come. Let me get my coat. - Why did you ask him? - I was being courteous. You idiot! He agreed straight away. No problem. We'll leave. Why do I need a coat? Come on, Babumushai. Let's go. Did you notice the colour of the water? It looks like the evening sun has melted and Hell! I feel as though a small boy has fallen down and hurt his nose and it's bleeding profusely. You fool! If you love the girl, hold her hand and propose to her. Why show her the sea and the sky? Whimp. Hypocrite. I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. I've never seen this friend of yours before. He came from Delhi a month ago for treatment. - What's happened? - It's a fatal disease. Do you know he won't live for more than 2 or 3 months? Unless God shows some miracle. You've never believed in God. I feel like believing in Him. I don't mind believing in anyone, just for Anand's sake. He's so jovial. Please don't tell him. He knows. He knows everything. And yet... No wonder, even the gods can't live without him. Life is a riddle. At times it makes us laugh, at times to cry. Life is a riddle. At times it makes us laugh, at times to cry. Even then this mind doesn't learn. It runs after dreams. Even then this mind doesn't learn. It runs after dreams. One day the person himself goes far away beyond the dreams. Life is a riddle. At times it makes us laugh, at times to cry. Those who lived here have felt both happiness and sorrow. Those who lived here have felt both happiness and sorrow. Finally choosing silence they leave for somewhere alone. Life is a riddle. At times it makes us laugh, at times to cry. Life. Come on, Bhaskar. So early in the morning? - Didn't Anand come too? - No. - He's gone to the police station. - The police station? Why? He was going somewhere. When I asked, he replied "I'm going to the police station to get a warrant against you." He was just joking. I've told him many times not to go out alone You never tell me anything about Anand. What's happened to him? Get an extra cup for Bhaskar first. Have a seat. - Prakash, I have some bad news. - Why, what's happened? We'll have to tell Trivedi soon. Anand won't be able to move around for long. Suman. What do you mean? Will you just treat him with tea? - What would you like him to have? - Oh! Do you have to ask? The cake we got yesterday will you cut it next year on your birthday? You're always after me. Trivedi called from Delhi yesterday. Anand's written a long letter to him. He's written that unless he arranges your wedding and finishes his work he won't return to Delhi and won't go anywhere else. Prakash, one thing puzzles me. How can his relatives live without him? I wouldn't be able to last a day without him. Anand doesn't have anyone, Bhaskar. What do you mean, he doesn't? There must be some relative. No. He's an orphan who came to Delhi during the partition. He lived with relatives for a while. When he started earning, he ran away. His relatives always thought he was trying to run away. He loves Suman a lot. He's told her everything. He's said, he wished you could choose friends as you could your relatives. He's also said that after meeting us he's started believing in long-lasting relationships. Trust me. As much as we worry about him - so much the more he worries about us. - I know Prakash. I know too that this love is his strength. That's why he can survive. If it was someone else, he'd be bed-ridden by now. Sometimes I feel scared that the few months that are left will be over very soon for Anand. When I leave him alone in the morning I worry whether I'll see him alive in the evening. Excuse me. A school teacher named Renu lives here. Can you tell me the number of her house. Renu - The one with the long plaits. - And round vermillion on her forehead - The one with the dimpled smile? - Yes. Do you want to know her house number? - First let us know your number. - What? - First let us know your number. - What do you mean? Everyone has a number here. The first is of a tall guy who doesn't live here but drops by her home sometimes. The second is mine and the third is his. We all have a number here. If you want to woo her, join the crowd. Yes. Now tell me the number of her house. - 25. - 25. Thank you. - What's your number? - 10. Get him to come back. We'll give him a number. Mother. You're great. You recognised me as soon as you saw me. - You're Renu's mother. - Yes. God bless you. Excuse me, but I don't recognise you. You don't know me but Renu does. I've come for her. - She's going to be late today. - That means I've come too early. - Don't sit there. - Why not? You can be with me too. - I have an important job for you. - What job? What was done in the past by elders is being carried out by a brother. - I don't understand. - I've got a proposal for Renu. - I want to make her my sister-in-law. - Oh. What can I say? Renu will have to decide about that. Times have changed. Girls no longer agree calmly with their parents and just get married. These days unless a boy and girl meet each other I know, Aunty. I know everything. The girl and boy have already met and I've seen them looking at each other. That's why I've come to you. Raghu Kaka and I approve of the girl. If you want to meet the boy, you can. He's a doctor and when Bhabi I mean the girl suffered from pneumonia, he treated her. - Who? Bhaskar? - Yes. He's my brother. Is that so? How lucky I am! Bhaskar's a gem of a person. Renu's forever praising him. That's it. It's fixed then. Sorry, Mummy. I mean, you must understand by now. I do. If they agree, that's good but because you're his brother, I should tell you I don't have anything to give my daughter in marriage. Why are you worried about that? What do you think the groom can give? Aspirin or penicillin? So the match is finalised. Everything's ready. Get me the horoscope. We'll fix the date in a week. But we can't do anything for three months. Three months! Why? Renu's father passed away nine months ago and so Then that's a problem. I won't be able to attend the marriage. Why? Are you going somewhere? Yes. I'll be leaving in a month or two. - Where are you going? - Far away. Can't you come back for the wedding? No. That will be too hard and I'll be in a rush. We don't get a return ticket from there. But you can start preparing for the wedding. I'll be leaving now. I have a lot of work to do. - Have some sweets. - No. I don't want to. I'll be back in two days and you'll have to treat me to lunch. You will, won't you? I'm so glad you've come up with this proposal for Renu but at the same time, I feel scared. I only have one daughter. How will I get by on my own? But now I feel my daughter's a stranger and you're my son. I hope God gives you a long life. Hey. You butted into our queue and disappeared. I couldn't help it. It was an emergency. We'll have to teach him a lesson along with the tall one. We'll cripple the girl. She won't be able to go out - and no one will be able to come here. - I see. You seem to be sensible. I hope you won't bother coming back. What do you mean? I'll have to. There are strong vibrations. So shall we be meeting again? Not only meeting but beating too. What did he mean? - That means kicking. - He's threatening us. - What's wrong? Hello. - Hello. - What do you want? - Dust. I want a little dust. This is a wrestlers' arena. You don't get dust here. I want the dust off your feet. You're the epitome of strength. I want to be at your feet. May you live long. If you want to build your body up, throw your clothes away. - You'll have to pay me my fees. - No, Papaji. I don't want to train under you. I saw your strength and asked for the dust off your feet. Look at me. I'm so useless! I can't save myself or my family. What's happened? Who's bothering you? There are a few men down the street who trouble my sister-in-law everyday. I mean I can't come freely to - my would-be sister-in-law's house. - Jeetu, I'll be back soon. Come on. Let's see who's troubling you. I'll Yes, please come. Papaji, there they are. No. Let me go first. When they come to hit me, you arrive. Papa, please come soon or they'll make pulp of me. Are you scared of them? Go on now. - Shall I - Yes, go on. - Here he comes again. - Hey, mister. Who have you come to fight with? Us or your Juliet? First let's rehearse. You'll find it easier later. Yes, let's. Papaji! Son of a dog! You're harassing his sister. Do you think we're nothing? Get going. Run. Wait. - What's this called? - Drain pipe pants. - What does that mean? - It means a dirty drain. Next time I see you wearing it I'll throw you in a dirty drain. Get lost. Papaji, you're great. - You really are strong. - God bless you, son. God, let Anand get well, I beg of you. Suman. - Suman. - What happened? You're sitting here talking to God and I'm looking for you. - Have these sweets. - Sweets? What for? Come here and sit down. My Babumushai has been cured. - What happened to him? - A dreadful disease. - Be thankful. I noticed the symptoms and searched for the medicine but before I could find it, the medicine found the patient. I'm confused. Who found who? - Renu found Babumushai. - Renu who? Babumushai's medicine. You don't know, Suman. Babumushai treated Renu and in the process fell love-sick. - How do you know? - I got it from him. You know him well, and yet you don't. I found out about it. You're not bothered about anyone. Don't pray just for yourself. Pray for others too. But today I asked God for something especially for me. What? What did you ask for? Oh, I know. Shall I buy some toys? I'm his uncle. What will my nephew say? What did you pray for? My nephew or a niece? Don't feel shy. Tell me what you asked for? I prayed for my brother's life. That rogue told you everything. Suman. Suman. Look at me. Look at me. You're my sister, but you're crying. You're so weak. You pray every day to God. Is this the strength He's given you? Are you weeping out of fear I'll leave you? I'm alive today. Aren't you happy? Can't you smile? Renu, come in. Please have a seat. Where did you learn that? From a body-builder friend. He's very strong. - Hey, Babumushai. - I've come to see you. - Me? - Yes. Not your friend. Speak softly or he'll be envious. - Renu. - You've come. - When did you come? - No, Babumushai. Go back. Wrong number. She's come to meet me. Tell him. - Yes, I've come to meet you. - That's right. He's jealous. Muralilal! You talk to her. I'll go and meet Murarilal. Oh, Murarilal. - Who's this Murarilal? - Watch. Hey, Murarilal. What brings you here? What's this beard for? Like King Shahjahan! Didn't you recognise me? We had beer at Qutub Minar and we got drunk? Jaichand. You're too much. - You left Delhi after those two pegs. - There weren't two but four of them. They were. They were two pegs but large ones. - Come on. Let's go again. - I've stopped drinking. - How about you? - No, I haven't. It's a habit now. Babumushai, come here. Are you married or still single? No, I'm not. The girl I approve of, my father disapproves of. He says she's too young. And the girl he approves of I disapprove of because she's old. Tell me about your girlfriend. She was of medium height. - What's happening, Anand? - Babumushai, didn't I tell you I'd meet Murarilal someday? I've found him. Murarilal, this is Dr. Bhaskar. I live with him. - Greetings! - Greetings! Jaichand and I are childhood friends. He was always naughty. His name isn't Jaichand. It's Anand. My name isn't Murarilal. It's Issa Bhai. Issa Bhai Suratwala. Remember me? - I hope your name is Bhaskar. - Yes. Teacher, where are you going? I was looking for you. You were splendid. Let's have some tea. - I can't. I have my rehearsals today. - Rehearsals? - Yes. I own a drama company. - You put on shows. - Yes. - Give me a role. I can act a bit too. I've seen your acting just now. Let's go. Babumushai, take care of her. I'm going to the drama company. - Let's go, master. - Yes. - Shall I leave? - Did you really come to meet Anand? Yes. I had planned to meet him too. You met him. What about me? - Sit with me for a while. - Don't you have to go to work? It's a half-hour job. I can do it any time. No, finish your work. I'll wait for you here. Hello, Panditji. Please have a seat. - Shall we rehearse? - Yes, we shall. But we can't create the mood like this. It's an Urdu drama. Wear your costumes. - Rajni, are you ready? - Yes, I am. Very good. Play the tape. Where's my turban? - Your Excellency. - I'm ashamed! In spite of being a prince you're in love with an ordinary girl. Father, if she's ordinary come a little closer. If you can, tell me someone better than her, I can, but I can't give you permission to go there because I... I understand, father. - Shekhu! - Father. I'm ashamed to have given birth to a son like you. It's every man's duty to be ashamed of his errors. Quiet, you fool. I'll bury you alive. Indeed! You can bury me but you can't keep me alive. Why didn't you die the day you were born? Life and death are in the hands of God, the Sublime One. You can't change it and neither can I. We're just puppets on a string and the strings are pulled by Him. When, who and how they will be pulled, you can never tell. Splendid! You were great. Fine. Now let's have a tea break. - How did you like it? - Wonderful. - Who? - Who what? What do you mean? I asked you about the rehearsal. Your rehearsal was good but the girl is really pretty. - Which one? - The one with the knife. - Oh, Rajni. - She must be your sister. - Shall I introduce you? - Yes. Well. Rajni, come here for a moment. This is Anand, a good actor from Delhi. He wants to talk to you. - Hello. - Hello. What plays have you performed in Delhi? I'm dead. I don't act. I just sing. What do you mean? Don't you speak Gujarati? What can I say to him? - You're right. - You don't know Hindi. He doesn't know Gujarati. Then there's no use in it. Go away! Go away! I've failed with the language. Yes, you have. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate anywhere that's without you. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate anywhere that's without you. I can't concentrate. I don't recall when I forgot to live. From the moment I found you, I've lived again. I don't recall when I forgot to live. From the moment I found you, I've lived again. Life I don't want to live without you. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate anywhere that's without you. I can't concentrate. Beloved, this admirer of yours can't control herself. I can't concentrate. Beloved, this admirer of yours can't control herself. Whenever you need to leave for somewhere tell Time to stop right there. Whenever you need to leave for somewhere tell Time to stop right there. That moment That moment must remain and not pass away. I can't concentrate. I can't concentrate anywhere that's without you. I can't concentrate. - Uncle Raghu, where's Renu? - Upstairs. Renu. You've come at last. I've been waiting for hours. What could I do? A doctor's work's like this. Does Anand like to record? Yes. He loves to talk. When he's tired, he starts the tape. The whole day? I mean, Renu was waiting for you. What happened? Why are you out of breath? Nothing, Babumushai. I found a girl for you and today I went looking for a girl for myself. - Did you find anyone? - Yes, I did - but I failed with language. - Why? What happened? She was a Gujarati girl and knows no other language. Yet I haven't lost hope. I've bought four Gujarati books. Won't I be able to learn Gujarati within a year? I know. If not now, at least in the next life. I'll carry a handycam with me. In my next life I'll fall in love at the age of 10. - Are you going out? - Yes, but you're not coming. Did you hear me? A timid guy is scolding me. No problem. Anand, you've received Trivedi's letter. Read it. I won't leave, even if Trivedi or Indira Gandhi invites me. There's no place like Bombay. Punjab, Sind, Gujarat, Maratha, Dravid, everyone settles here. I've decided I'll live and die in Bombay. Anand was breathless while talking today. These are his last signs. In the medical profession there's a stage when no treatment helps and the doctor has to wait for the patient's death. No one can perceive this helpless situation except a doctor. Oh, God! Such frightening helplessness. I won't let you go so quietly, mummy. What were you murmuring so softly? - I was praying to God. - What did you ask Him for? I asked Jesus something for you. - I'm dead. What have you done? - Why, what's happened? Don't you know? I'm a disciple of Lord Shiva and you prayed to Jesus. What if they fight each other? - You fool. - Mummy, you don't know. Shivji's very short-tempered. It's all right. God hasn't seen my temper. If they interfere I'll be born as your son in my next life. What's your opinion? Good. You're here. You can be the witness. I've made a pact with mummy. I'll be born to her in my next life. He's an idiot. He just blabbers. Aren't you my son now? Why wait for the next rebirth? Yes, that's true. - So he doesn't move around. - No. I've seen so many deaths but I won't be able to bear this one. We're trying our very best. What are we doing? Man's reached the moon. We've even reached outer space but what have we done to fight human diseases pain and torment? Nothing! Sometimes I feel so helpless, Prakash. Won't you go and see Anand? Go and meet him just this time. He won't survive for long. No, Bhaskar. I don't have the courage. I don't have the courage. I'll be leaving now. I have to go to church. You sit here and talk to him. I'll come again. - It's not nice to make others cry. - Why? I wanted mummy to laugh but she cried. I try to make everyone laugh but they all cry. You don't understand. When there's too much joy tears flow from your eyes. Your mummy didn't weep because she was sad but because she was happy. Where will she find a son like you? Yes. You're right. And where will you find a brother like me? See what I've got you. Wait here. I'll go and get it. Anand, you're crazy. Don't scold me in Bengali. I'm not. I said you're crazy. Why did you take the flower out from my hair? - I'll preserve it in my poetry book. - Why? Poetry reminds us of years past. In the same way this flower will be my poetry. - I told you, you're crazy. - I am and I'm crazy about you. Sometimes I feel that if I envelope you in my arms you'll melt and become one with me. You'll remain in my arms forever. When I breathe, I should hear your breath within me and you'll call me by my name: "Anand, Anand." - Who is she? - Who? - This girl. - She's my Bengali girlfriend. You're smart. You asked your brother to tell you everything and hid your own concerns. Who is she? What's her name? Her name? What will it do you to know it? Where does she live? - In Delhi. - Where in Delhi? In her husband's house. Oh. So she's married! No, she wasn't when we met. He's a nice man, her husband. He loves her very much. She'll be happy. If she'd married me, she'd be dead. Do you know? We used to find very little time to see each other. That's why I used to tape her voice secretly when we met and after she left I'd listen to it all over, again and again. When did she get married? Three months and seven days ago. When did you come from Delhi? Exactly three months and seven days ago. Forget it. Why go into these details now? Look at what I've got for you. Do you like it? Shall I tell you something? Wear it while I'm still alive. Hey, Babumushai. What are you doing here all alone? Oh! You're thinking of her. That's love. You fall in love and love troubles you. Anand, leave me alone for a while. If I leave you alone now, there'll be problems. Let's go to the other room and record your voice. Anand, please go to your room. I will, but I'll take you with me. - I told you, I want to be alone. - And I don't want you to be alone. Anand why are you pursuing me? Why do you expect me to do everything you tell me to? You laugh and expect me to laugh. I'm sorry, Babumushai. - Anand, don't feel hurt. You know I - Babumushai how many times will you remind me that my days are dwindling. My end is coming. Babumushai, no one has faced death... But I'm so unfortunate that every day and every moment, every second on your face in your eyes... No, Babumushai. I can face death but I can't bear to see your frightened face. I'll go away. I'll leave tomorrow. No, Anand. You won't go anywhere. You don't have anyone. If you do die, you'll die here in my arms. That's the spirit. Do you know my problem? Our spirit of joy is always dampened with melancholy and that poisons our cheerfuIness. Babumushai, I'm not going to die today. And even if I die I won't leave you alone. I'll always stay here. Yes, Anand. I know you're a part of me a part of my life - but I'll miss one thing. - What? - Your voice, this chatter. - Then let's record this chatter. - But first we'll record your poem. - Which one? The one you wrote in your days at college. Oh, Death is a poem. Let's go. Come on. Death is a poem. Yet I've promised this poem that someday I'll meet. When sleep overcomes even the painful sinking nerves when the yellow moon rises slowly in the sky when the sun sets at twilight and night is on the horizon when it's neither dark nor bright nor night or day when our body no longer lives and the soul starts breathing I've promised this poem that someday I'll meet. - Now you say something. - What? Anything, but you'll have to talk for my sake. Yes, that's right. Babumushai life and death are in the hands of God, the Sublime One. Neither you nor I can change that. We're just puppets on a stage whose strings are pulled by Him. When, how and who will go, one can never tell. Anand Anand, sit down. - Munna. - Yes, Uncle Raghu? - Can you lend me 50 rupees? - Yes. It's in the drawer upstairs. I need four or five days leave. Leave? You're taking leave. You know Anand's condition. I'm taking it for him. I want to go to my village. There's a temple of a goddess who's very powerful. I'll get her blessings for him. I've seen the dead come back to life. Go soon, Uncle Raghu. There's very little time left. I'll leave by the 11.00 o'clock train and return in two days. Don't worry, Munna. Anand will be all right. Jaichand. Come, Issa Bhai. Greetings. - Where is he? - Please have a seat. I don't have the time. There are final rehearsals today. I've a lot of work to do. Please call Jaichand quickly. - He won't be able to come. - He will. He'll come for sure. You just tell him that Rajni Bahen that Rajni's rehearsals are on and he'll come talking in Gujarati. The problem is that - OK, Munna. - You're leaving. Come back soon. As soon as possible. This medicine can cure poison fever, cholera, cancer or any other disease. No, Uncle Raghu. Any disease can be cured but not cancer. It can be. Even that can be cured. - Absolutely. - Yes, I will. You'll lose. I've never lost a bet. My father was a famous doctor too. He always said, "One who gets this dreaded disease" - "will surely die." - It's not a doctor's medicine. - What medicine is it? - It's called belief. I'll leave now. I'm sure his cancer will be cured. Who's got cancer? Anyone I know? Yes. He's close to me. Who? Anand. That's why I said, he can't come with you. He's in the last stages. I don't know when He knew didn't he, doctor? Wow! Wow! Even on his death bed the student taught the teacher about life. Keep sorrows to yourself and give joy to others. Wow! Wow! Doctor can I see him just once? Yes. Please do come. Anand. - Gurudev. - You're making an early exit. Very smart. You've taken the clapping and left the empty chairs for us. What can I do? My dialogues are all over or else I'd have challenged you. Sure, but we'll meet up there. Set your Anand troupe and your own drama. I'll join you. If you need any actress from here, inform me and I'll get her along. I need one, but not now. I'll have to learn Gujarati first. I'll leave now. I'll come again. - Where? - Here. I'll meet you here. I won't let the curtain fall. Issa Bhai Doctor I hope Uncle Raghu wins the bet. Thus these are a few pages left in Anand's life like his last few days. Renu was right. God needs good people as much as we do. No one can go against His wishes. Sometimes they say, "A prayer creates miracles." and at this moment I know, everyone must be doing just that. But all of us know the climax and we're waiting anxiously. When? No. Anand, have some oxygen. You'll feel better. Babumushai, open all the windows. Prakash, I'm going to Dr. Shastri I've heard there's a homeopathic medicine - that can create miracles at times. - Don't be an idiot. Don't you realise, nothing can be done. How do you know nothing will help? Haven't miracles happened before? - Babumushai - Anand, I'll come back soon. Don't go anywhere, Babumushai. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Renu, I don't want to die. Try and save me. - He's very weak. He won't be able to bear my death. - Brother, Anand! He won't be able to bear my death. - Brother, Anand! Brother, Anand! - Has Babumushai returned? - He'll come soon. He'll come soon. Has Babumushai returned? Babumushai! - My friend - Yes, Anand? My friend, start the tape quickly. My friend, start the tape quickly. Sister death is a poem yet I've promised this poem that someday I'll meet when sleep overcomes even the painful, sinking nerves when the yellow moon rises slowly in the sky when the sun sets at twilight and when night is on the horizon when it's neither dark nor bright nor night nor day - when our body no longer lives - Babumushai! Prakash, Dr. Shastri No, I won't let you be silent like this. I've been listening to your chatter for the last six months. You've chewed my brains. Talk to me now. Talk to me. Talk to me. Babumushai! Life and death are in the hands of God, the Sublime One. Neither you nor I can change it. We're puppets on a stage whose strings are pulled by Him. When, how and who will go, no one can predict.
