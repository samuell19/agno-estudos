The film that you're about to see received the Best Director award at the Venice Film Festival in 1955. THE BAD ENCOUNTERS The film that you're about to see is the story of a modern girl, a young provincial brutally thrown into the feverish atmosphere of Paris. Implicated in an abortion case and interrogated at the Police HQ, she will revisit in her memory the snapshots of her life. She recalls, one by one, the different men she met who turned out to be such "Bad Encounters" for her. What did you expect? Have you decided to speak at last? Name: Racan, Catherine. Occupation: journalist. Case: Dr. Danielli (on the run) sought for illegal abortions The witness, one of his clients... Hello. This is Forbin. No, not yet. Nothing of interest. We have no proof! Apart from that note and the anonymous letter, we have nothing and she knows it. But... She knows Danielli well. I'm sure she resorted to his services. Don't have too many illusions... I think it's better to stop the interrogation and resume it later. So they're in a hurry? What do you want me to do? It's not my fault they let the doctor slip away. Tell the director we'll keep him posted. Any news, Inspector? How many times can I repeat it to you? I'll fill you in any moment you want. Have you managed to get ahold of the doctor? As you can see, I haven't. That Racan, what is she doing there? Nothing at all. - OK. I understand. - That would surprise me. Have you thought it over? Have you decided to cooperate? Do you realize that you've already confessed everything without even knowing it? I advise you to stop this little game and to sign your confession quickly. Do you understand? You just need to sign your statement and you're free. You'll go home and it'll be over. Are we in agreement? What about the doctor? What about him? Do you agree? No? No! As you wish. I can search your place, I can even arrest you. You know what that means? Then you'll have to explain yourself to the investigating judge. Let's go over your statement. When you disagree, stop me. Let's do it in your own words. During the interrogation, the witness stated: I met Dr. Danielli... through a mutual friend named Alain Berg?re. Question: Did that encounter take place at the doctor's legal residence? Did you meet him at his place? This wasn't the way you're trying to insinuate it... Danielli invited a few friends over... I don't insinuate anything, miss. It was during that party... to which I came with Alain Berg?re, a mutual acquaintance, a photographer for a fashion magazine. Question: 5 weeks later, did you come back to the doctor's place to tell him about your predicament? You were pregnant, you asked him if he would agree... What's wrong? You aren't feeling well? It was at the end of October. You went back to Danielli and you asked him about a special kind of service. He didn't see any problem and agreed to it, right? Did he agree? When you came back to Danielli to discuss your condition, did anybody come along with you? You know well it was at his place. You forget that Danielli was my doctor. I've already told you, it's in my statement. I don't know why I keep answering your questions. Do you recognize this letter? It's in your handwriting: "January 5, 1954, Dr. Danielli, Avenue de Tourville." Do you want me to read it? I know what's in it. I wrote it. It's clear, isn't it? It only said that I wasn't feeling well. I've already told you that Danielli was my doctor. Why didn't you want to call him? You refuse to answer? I'll note that you refuse to answer. - Who brought this letter? - No one. No one. You didn't feel well and no one brought the letter. You're lying. Your concierge saw someone He even recognized Alain Berg?re, your lover. It's not true. It wasn't him. Who then? - I don't know. A friend. - Your lover? Not at all. His name? What do you want to know? My life is my business! Since this morning, with all your questions, I don't know where I am. What do you take people for? You think we have time to come up with alibies as we live? Should we take notes so later on we could explain how it happened? Life isn't like that. Not at all. I don't care about your files, your questions, your informers, You don't understand anything. There are things that you'll never know. Never, do you hear me? I suggest that you'd leave me alone. I have nothing else to tell you. Because I've had enough! I want to go home! I understand, you're entrapped and that hurts. I advise you not to resist. Sign. It'll be better afterwards. So you haven't understood. You're unable to understand anything. You know nothing of what's really going on. Nothing. Nothing. You have to discover Paris at dusk, when you're 20 and have just arrived from the country... It's the hour when the first lights go up, the hour when this gleaming and mysterious life begins in the capital, as you stroll in its midst, and where you'll play a role some day. The workshops and offices have just closed, the theaters are about to open, the whole Paris is a theater. At last, it lives up to its myth. And we... we live up to our dreams. Paris, the magic name! Paris, the promised land! At last, we camp on the bank of your river. What dreams, what illusions don't turn up in this sleep? What hopes? Paris for just the two of us. Just the two of us in Paris. How many ambitious young people arriving from Clermont-Ferran or Carcassonne didn't hear themselves repeating this phrase, with a girl's head on their shoulder? This city is so beautiful! And all this belongs to us now! It won't be easy, I know. But you'll see, we'll make it. I'm sure. You'll see. What's the point of coming that far if we aren't going to go all the way? And we've been so lucky from the beginning. We could've been apart, you and me, fighting alone in the dark. We're so much stronger when there's two of us. To win, to succeed, to become famous. to make a name for yourself. As everyone knows, alas, that so often dreams remain just dreams. illusions are lost and hopes are frustrated. What's left for youth but to take the road back home? So one night, we find ourselves driving to the same station, at the same hour, when Paris once held so much promise. What a pity! How sad is to leave like a thief, carrying in your suitcase nothing but the bitterness of a defeat! Passengers traveling to Dijon-Besan?on please, board the train. Passengers traveling to Dijon-Besan?on... We're the same but the feeling is different. I've bought you newspapers. When I decided to quit, I thought I'd never be able to read a paper again. You see, one gets used to everything. Catherine! - What are you going to do now? - I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet. I'll work. First, I'd like to take a break for a while. And then... Pierre, do you remember? Don't you want to leave with me? No. You'll be better off alone if you want to start over. - That's what I was saying. - I know. Stay! No, Catherine. It's not for me. I feel that I'll never make it. Go now because I don't have any courage left! It takes more courage to stay. Goodbye, Pierre! Goodbye, Catherine! We were doomed from the start! We weren't strong enough! It's my fault! Forgive me! It wasn't your fault... But why to spend your life asking for forgiveness? I'm leaving you. Take a seat. They'll bring you something to eat. And remember what I told you. It was true. I didn't really know what I was going to do. I was distraught. I needed to figure out the situation. I had enough money for two weeks, maybe three. I bought a ticket for the Riviera. If you allow me... I assure you, it's not mine. It's for my secretary who couldn't come. I'm not superstitious. I don't believe in chance or fateful encounters. We see each other, we cross paths. Why do we have to meet again? Alas, a few days later, when my short vacation was coming to an end, I found myself in his presence again. My first reaction was to flee, to retreat as I was afraid of what was going to happen to me... I was no longer able to leave, I didn't want to anymore. I felt a vertiginous urge to stay there, spying, observing... Miss... I'm so clumsy... I'm sorry... I'm so embarrassed... Did you have a good trip? What are you looking for? Let me help you... No, I was leaving... I came only to buy a detective novel, but I got distracted with these books on art... Me too, you see? Isn't it moving? Very moving. What always strikes me in these reproductions is that the slightest detail bears the author's signature, his touch. He talked and talked, and I wasn't listening. I felt as I was flying, gliding... It was like a vertigo. Don't they frighten you, all these books, all this accumulated knowledge, all these things that no one will ever read? The voice by my side sounded so familiar, repeating the same things, the same discourses, intelligent and useless, the same words. What's wrong? - With me? - Yes. You've suddenly become so sad. Is it something I said that brought you on the verge of tears? No, it's nothing. I was just thinking why men's conversations always veer towards general subjects. Let's have lunch together. No, not lunch, let's meet tonight. - Tonight? - Yes, let's have dinner. Don't tell me you can't go. Here's my proposition: I'll be waiting for you at 10pm at "The Jungle" for dinner. Please let me know if you're busy of have better things to do. Come if you want to. If you want to... Did I want to? No! I don't drink much. As you wish. Don't worry, I'm not forcing you. You don't need it. And you? I can drink, or pretend to be drinking, under certain circumstances and when I want to. And tonight you don't want to. Not the slightest. - Are you hurt? - No, don't worry. It's nothing. I can give you my handkerchief. No, I have all I need. Thanks. You see? You asked me this morning why men prefer to talk about general subjects with women. Look what happens when they abandon that terrain, and when they try to give a conversation a slightly more personal tone? It's amazing how fast things can go, and soon a conversation isn't possible. Do I seem reasonable? Good. Let's sit down now and try to dine quietly. Do you believe in Hell? Me? Oh, I'm so silly. I like the idea. I'd like to try it. Sin isn't that bad. It's a splendid invention. It's amazing how you start appreciating things when you believe you can burn for eternity. But between you and me, frankly, I don't believe in it. Furthermore, is it really necessary? Look at them. They think they're having fun but they're dying of boredom... ... and fear. Don't you think they are punished enough with or without Hell? It's not funny at all what you're talking about. It's not uplifting. Why? Because... You speak of those things with such disenchantment and pessimism. With such disenchantment and pessimism? You're so blunt. No. No. People get what they deserve. If they're dying of boredom, good for them. They don't take any risk. They want to have it all - for credit or free, to seize the day. They get used to everything - in advance and deliberately - so they wouldn't miss out, as they say. I don't know why I'm telling you this. You're so young. It's strange. I just thought while listening to you that you suddenly seemed so old. Is it because I gesticulate or speak too loudly? Why don't you pour me a drink? I feel so thirsty now. What's your name? My name won't mean anything... ...and we'll part in an hour. Yes, in an hour. You're right. You knew that I'd come? I was sure of it. - Do you regret it? - I never regret anything. I like talking to you, you know? I like listening to what you're saying. For example, when you were talking about Hell just now... it's not that I believe in it but I agree with you. Why are you smiling all the time? You aren't listening to me? Are you laughing at me? It's hot in here. Let's go. Let's get some fresh air. You're freezing. Come, let me get you a coat. Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment. Here's your coat. Let me go. Let me go! I'm sorry. One doesn't find happiness without instantly sensing what's threatening it. What's left of the days when we were happy but a few rare minutes? A few brief moments when you wanted to take him in your arms and press him to you bosom to prevent him from escaping... ... the majority likes to suntan at the Mediterranean. Catherine! Catherine! You know what I'm thinking of? I'm wondering how we could put your youth to use. Some of them treat it like the lobby of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Suspension point... It's not too bad for a beginner. No, I know. Don't tell me again that your first lover also wanted to be a journalist. Too bad, I didn't meet you earlier. I could've helped you with this one. - Blaise! - I'm sure he would've refused... He was set on being a failure. Today's young people are all alike. Smothered by scruples, then they reach for their gun once they've heard the word "success." It's a form of pride, or their fear of life. Girls are very simple: they close their eyes and go ahead without looking under their feet. They can go anywhere because they don't see anything. That's why they always go all the way. Which one of the dresses do you like the most? None. There are women in the audience who are much better dressed. Great! It's my photographer, all I could find in Nice. Could you go around the room and take pictures of women at the tables? Ms. Racan will tell you who. I'm going to sleep because fashion is women's business. But, Blaise, I wouldn't know... And then you'll tell me what you've found. We'll start with the prettiest. Alain Berg?re. - And you sign: Catherine Racan. - But, Blaise... Catherine Racan. It's a very good name for a fashion reporter. - And your article isn't bad at all. - Blaise, I didn't write a single line. You even managed to reveal some talent in that stupid photographer from Nice ...that I thought of hiring. - But you dictated everything. Really? Well... You know, it surprises me. I find it better than what I usually write. You were very precise, my little doe. You see? I'm improving. Catherine! Do you hear me, Catherine? I have big plans for you. Don't argue without knowing what I'm talking about. Your article created some splash. People ask about you, want to know who you are. Do you want to know how they talk about you at the editorial office? With certain fear. Fear? You know I'm here. What do you think? I'll see that you'll succeed. It's not that unpleasant. It's a little vain, I agree, but you'll get over it. You have to live with that. It's this or nothing, my little girl. You'll understand it soon. There's even a little terrifying when you think about it. All these games, this life... Something terrifying and appealing at the same time, that makes your head spin. It's a bit like a jungle, full of danger, fever, violence... full of illusions, lies and madness. One has to be strong, you'll see... no hesitation, no trembling, no retreat. And especially, never look back. There are so many good things in front of you. Everybody wants to win. - To win? - Yes, to win. And those who don't admit it are hypocrites or cowards. Too bad for them. I have faith in you. You'll learn the rules of the game fast. I bet on you, you see? Maybe you're mistaken. Maybe I'm like the others. Catherine. Maybe I don't have the force either. Please, no complications, no complexes! Leave scruples and bad conscience to others, like your friend Pierre. - Blaise! - To me, they're all losers! At least, don't blame me for having ambitions for you. How could I recognize you so quickly if you were like the others? Do you believe I'm interested in you? You desire me, that's all. Now you ask yourself what you're going to do with me. You throw me in your game. But I'm not doing it for myself, Catherine. It's for you. - It's because... - Yes, Blaise. I know. Me too. At least, you don't regret it yet? No, Blaise. I regret nothing. I never regret anything. Sit down. You haven't touched anything. You aren't hungry? OK, as they say... Tell me, Ms. Racan, why didn't you tell me you knew Mr. Walter? Mr. Blaise Walter. Don't deny it. Amazing, how eloquent this little notebook can be... Because you've probably searched my place... You're implying that I don't have the right but I don't care. If you agreed to tell what you knew... Mr. Walter has nothing to do with it. Are you sure that Mr. Walter has nothing to do with it? Too bad. Too bad. Think carefully of what I'm asking. It's in your interests. Have you seen him lately? On what terms did you part? I've told you that Mr. Walter... Last year you spent two weeks with him on the Riviera. It's written all over your notebook. Have you met him since then? Don't tell me that in these circles... and now... You worked for his newspaper. If Mr. Walter was involved in this that would've suited you. - Is that what you're implying? - Don't be silly! I only want to help you. Me? Never, do you hear me? Never! Yes, I knew Mr. Walter well. I was even his mistress as you say. But my notebook that you studied so carefully is perfectly clear on this: I haven't seen him for a year. Is that clear? You don't believe me? Ask him yourself. Call him. At this hour you'll certainly find him at his newspaper. Do you know his number? What are you waiting for? You aren't going to call him? OK. I believe you. And now would you please tell me all that happened between Danielli and you. Let's finish our story! I'm talking to you, miss! No, Blaise. I don't regret anything. I never regret anything. I never regret anything. When they met again what a fateful encounter it was. It was certain from the first sight that one gesture from one or another was enough for everything to start again. One gesture was enough, but the effects of time were irrevocable. So your friend Walter dumped you? How dare you? From that moment, as far as she was concerned, everything was finished. Exit these two. That makes it simpler, right? Don't you think? I don't understand what you're trying to say. And this, you don't understand either? I know, we've already talked about it. But let me explain: You return to Paris, you're looking for a job... You find it in a ladies' magazine where you relationship with Walter opens the doors for you. That doesn't prevent you from going out... You visit the bars and clubs near St.Germain-des-Pr?s... - You meet jazz musicians... - You're so well informed. Look, you've finally understood. And at that time Alain Berg?re became your lover. It's not true! Thanks. Don't move. Thanks. I hope we can call you again for the follow-up. It was very nice of you. No. It's only natural. Because this job is very important for me at the moment. I was in your situation not that long ago. I can only thank you for that. Are you free? No, I meant for dinner. Invite me because you really need to thank me. I understand. I'm inviting you then. No complexes, please. You'll pay me back when you get the money for the photos. It's so crowded here. Let's go somewhere else. What do we do? I don't know. - You want to go to the movies? - Is there an American film playing? Sure. I don't go to the movies to see a film. I go to the movies just like that. - What do you mean "just like that"? - Just like that. You guys, are all alike. You can never decide. You need to be taken by the hand and then you're surprised. And then you complain you've been had. Does it happen to you often? You don't want to tell me you're that old? If I told you what life taught me about guys... It doesn't show but I've had my share of tears. You're saying all this but if you put yourself in our place... We are too, you know... I'm so tired. I have been up since 8am. Where do we go? - Let's sit down. - Over there? Caf?s are made for people who can't decide. They are full of us. - I wish I knew what drink to order. - It's so easy. First order "whatever" and then "the same thing." It's a kids' play. Waiter! What's wrong? You don't want to sit down? Don't they scare you - this noise, this night, this city, ...these lights? - And you? There are days when I want to leave this all, and then I don't have enough courage. How beautiful Paris was when we'd just discovered it! Do you remember? How new everything was! Scintillating! So full of hope and promise! Everything changes - the people, the places... Like just now, at that caf?, I didn't notice a single friendly face. Do you know where I'm going? And Blaise? Did Walter see you when you came to Paris? Did he offer you a job? He saw me once, barely let me in the door, ...like he barely recognized me.. - Yes, he's like that. I didn't want to say it to you... I'm a big girl. You can tell me all now. OK. I'll take you home. Get in. And one for the doctor! Do you know Catherine? Dr. Danielli. Catherine Racan. Good evening. It's Dr. Danielli... You don't have to do it every time. I never forget a pretty face. - You know everybody. - But Doctor... Yes, you know them all by heart: their names, faces, phone numbers, bank account numbers, All women in Paris fight to get them. A few known names create an illusion of having read a good article. Right, Alain? Wait! H?l?ne! H?l?ne! This is H?l?ne, she's in charge of a radio program. Have you met? Miss... I don't have to introduce you two. Hello, Alain. Hello, H?l?ne. Hello, Alain. Hello, H?l?ne... Everybody knows each other, used to know or will get to know some day. Excuse me. I have to make other introductions. There's no need to introduce you two? Good. I'd like to ask you a few questions. - I assure you, I don't understand. - You will soon. Did you meet H?l?ne Ducouret at Dr. Danielli's? Yes or no? Yes. H?l?ne Ducouret was Alain Berg?re's mistress before you. - Oh please... - May I continue? And who also became Danielli's mistress. When you met the witness, did you know about her relationship with Berg?re? I didn't know anything. I was never concerned with people's private lives. It's up to you. She came here to talk to me about your friend Danielli, Don't worry about it. We'll call you when we need you. Ms. Ducouret, I'm listening. Do you like these parties? I hate them. Jacques loves them. However, in his situation, they are absolutely necessary. Do you realize that? Don't you think Alain looks too gloomy? Maybe you don't notice since you see him every day ...but you have to pay attention. - He works too much, poor soul, He's up since 8am. - I admire you. He owes you everything but I'm so happy that he's finally found his way. He deserves to succeed. It's only fair, isn't it? He's wasted enough time. I hope H?l?ne is being a good hostess? The subject of our conversation has turned passionate, like a novel. And we're only on the first chapter. Did you talk about Alain? I like Alain. He lacks self-confidence but you've changed him. H?l?ne is different. She's so sceptical, so lucid. It may only hurt her. I have nothing to fear anymore. I'm immune to all this. I have in me this old, melancholy streak, that makes me shed tears of blood and desesperation about the human condition. I swear, I'm not kidding. - Have you seen Catherine? - Catherine? She's with Danielli, at the buffet. - There's no reason to push me over. - I'm sorry. Oh, you excuse yourself now! - Oh please... - I assure you, you're making progress. I was just talking to Ms. Racan. How you like to spoil things! Tell Danielli that we aren't here to wash our dirty linen! Right, let's behave like gentlemen, or pretend to be ones. - Shut up! - You're at my home. - Even more reason to. H?l?ne is so dear to me because she offers an example of someone very realistic and tough, who doesn't forget, from time to time, to show compassion for the others. - You aren't drinking? - No, I'm listening to you. Beware, you should never listen to men talking about themselves, because in that case they're usually talking about something else, without ever recognizing it. What's wrong? Excuse me. - How nice of you to come. - I promised you. I've kept the promise but I can't stay long. I think you know everybody except maybe Ms. Racan. We've met before. It's a small world. Indeed. Alain Berg?re. Excuse me. Excuse me, I have a phone call. Do you know Danielli? - Through Alain. - Alain? Alain Berg?re, the photographer from Nice. Don't you remember anything? I've seen too much. Is it him? The kid is making progress. Bravo! I like seeing people succeed. You also look more assured. They talk a lot about you in press circles. I'm not exaggerating. I'm really happy. And a bit flattered. It's all due to my articles. Well, they're yours. It's very kind of you. It's nice here, isn't it? And it's one of the most liberal homes. Danielli is a charming man. One may say: vices humanize a man so much, They tidy him up, give him polish... I'm sure you agree with me now. No, don't worry, Madam. I'm sure it's not that serious. Yes, I'll be there in 10 minutes. You aren't interrupting. Please, wait for me. Hello? Agreed. See you soon, madam. - You see, it's like this. - Do you have to leave, doctor? Of course. Do you really have to rush out at this hour, while all these people having fun right now. Do you really think they're having fun? Are you having fun? I don't know. You've just got me worried. Rest assured, I'm not asking for anything. I never ask anyone for anything. What for? But there are moments when we have a panic attack. Doesn't it happen to you? Yes. Especially, you, young women. I'm always worried about you. You want to live like boys but you're so different and more vulnerable. Well, Ms. Racan, I'm simply trying to tell you that you can trust me... because... I like you a lot. I hope we can talk about all this when we see each other again. See you later, dear. Go on having fun without me. You didn't know? Blaise and Catherine... You have all the links in the chain. Look, Alain, please do me a favor. I'm so tired. You feel tired when it suits you. Let's have fun for once. Do as you wish. Catherine! Are you leaving? Without saying "goodbye" to me? I'm tired. All this is going too fast for me. I have to get used to it. Goodbye. - Catherine! - I have to go now. This thing with Alain Berg?re... Is it serious? Is this a police interrogation? No, you misunderstood! Life is so stupid! - Life is what you make of it. - You haven't changed a bit! Life is a lottery! The numbers are up by chance: 7 and 14, 8 and 15... And it goes on like this forever. Regarding Alain and me, I don't intend to dedicate my whole life to him. It doesn't lead you anywhere. What a waste! Wasted time, wasted tenderness... Why to conceal it? Whose fault is it? Yours. - Mine? - Yes, yours. Don't pretend you don't understand. You know perfectly well what I'm saying. For a few days, your eyes were sad and melancholy, and then what? You were wrong about me, that's what I reproach you for. You thought you had to defend yourself against me. I confess that I was afraid. Yes, afraid! I was afraid to be a burden to you. Afraid of me? Look at me and look at yourself! You could make anything out of me, and you knew it well. Stop it. You could take me by the hand and I'd follow you to the end of the world. I'd never met anyone before you. No one, you understand? You were everything for me... Catherine... No, no. Do you remember: never regret anything? So many chances lost... So many illusions destroyed... How you're trembling, Catherine... Yes, you're trembling. You're afraid. As soon as I'd entered that room I only saw the void, the ghosts... until I'd seen again your face... - No, Blaise! I thought if there was a chance to touch your shoulder... - No, Blaise! It's too late now. Listen, no more speeches. - You aren't going to let me leave just like that? - Let me go. - I was alone too! - Let me go! - Come, the car is waiting! - It's not possible! - Why, is it because of him? - Because of whom, of what? What does it matter? Did you really think that you could disappear just like that, and I'd stay there breathless, motionless, waiting for your favors, praying to Heaven to send you back my way? Life isn't that simple, Blaise. You were right. And for all this... you let me come up here to tell me all this. Blaise! To let me know I can't keep you 'cause I was lucky to have you the first time. - For this? Tell me! - Blaise! Catherine... It's all over now. It's forgotten, erased... They're together, I saw them. Did you notice how they looked at each other all night? Blaise left the same time as Danielli. He warned that he wouldn' t stay long. - As you you wish, my boy. If it suits you... - Shut up! She loves him, it's obvious. She's always loved only him. Go ahead! Catherine, what are you doing here? What's wrong? Bastard! Come here, little idiot! Alain! Stop! Are you crazy? I can explain! We can't leave them like that! We have to do something! It's your fault. Now let Alain take his revenge! These two are crazy! Leave me alone! Puppies! Catherine... It's over. - Go away! Don't you understand? Go away! Very nice. Danielli is innocent. I swear! - What about this? - What does it prove? Because I wrote it. Don't you believe me? I'm asking myself how I can believe you. When you typed in an anonymous letter, did you put just lies in there? I'm telling you I was jealous, blinded by jealousy. That's what you say. Just think for a second... I'm here only to make up for the harm I've done. I wrote this letter when I was mad. You have to understand me. Did you know what kind of service the doctor was asked for? All I know that he refused. Did Danielli tell you that Ms. Racan came to see him? Yes, he hinted it. What about the professional secrets? OK, he hinted it to you... but when? I don't remember exactly... Wait... Was it a few days or weeks after that party? - No, much later. - When exactly? Very recently. Danielli and Catherine started seeing each other a lot. He told me she interested him. He found her amusing. - And Danielli naturally refused? - I'm sure of it! He would never agree to it! Miss, you seem to be pretty well informed about Ms. Racan's life. Can you tell me whom she's been seeing recently? Someone like Ms. Racan's seeing a lot of people. Like your friend Alain Berg?re? They meet from time to time but officially they broke up. - How do you know? - In our circles, everything is known. - How about Mr. Walter? - Blaise? I think he got the message... Actually, Ms. Racan disappeared from our circle recently. She went to the country for a change of scene, to her family near Besan?on. And then she suddenly reappeared. There's someone you could probably interrogate... a little trumpeter with whom Catherine spent a lot of time. Thank you. Did you say Besan?on? I believe she has a lot of ties there - her parents and friends... Are you sure Ms. Racan came to see Dr. Danielli after her trip? Yes, I told you it was in the early autumn. We haven't seen her again after that incident... Find me anything from Besan?on - letters, telegrams... If they've already left the apartment, send them back. - What is it? - We've found the trace of Danielli's. OK, go. If there's anything new, report to me. OK? Tell me, Ms. Racan... Why didn't you tell me that you went back to Besan?on? It's not true! That's what she told you. She hates Danielli and she hates me. Besan?on is where Pierre Jaeger lives - the young man with whom you arrived to Paris. - You saw him again, right? - It's not true! She made this all up! Why are you resisting? There's concrete proof against you. We've found the documents and letters at your place... They leave no doubt about your little adventure with your friend. You have no right, you hear me? You have no right! I'll tell you the truth, and it's very simple... During your trip to Besan?on, you met your former boyfriend. Maybe you tried living together again. I don't know and I don't care. I'm not asking you why you didn't want to stay with him, but one thing is clear when you'd returned to Paris you needed to see Danielli. The dates, this telegram, the doctor's statement, the testimonies we've got - everything concurs. As you wish, at this point... Look what we've found! This came from Besan?on. It's postmarked. "Catherine, my dear Catherine, "When you came here I was so excited to see you again. "I'll never forget the few days we spent together. "Our happiness from the old days was reborn. "Something was telling me that your love smacked of pity. "but I tried not to let it show. "I tried to resemble what you wanted me to be. "We should have remained just friends and not to start it over. "Everything would've been simpler. "You should've realized that, and I should've more courage to resist you. "My conduct at the station was unforgivable but you have to forgive me. No, Pierre, no! "Happiness, when you've found it after having lost it... "And when you've lost it again, that hurts so much. "It seems that you can understand me and forgive me. Be careful, Pierre! "When I saw on the train that was taking you away, "I realized that you were leaving for good, "that you were abandoning me once again, but this time I'll never see you again, never again..." Get off, Pierre! The train is leaving! - I thought the train would leave. - I'm short of time. We have 5 more minutes. We've said everything. Let's not start it all over again. What if I stopped you from leaving or left with you? Don't be silly. Don't spoil everything now. What if I left with you? What if your Parisian friends saw you returning with a hick in your luggage! - Your Walters, your Daniellis! - Shut up! Because you're going back and trying to find more reason to! And just your impulses aren't enough for you! Tell me, why did you come back here? Because you'd also realized that! You aren't stronger than everybody else! I came because I wanted to see you again, Pierre. For a moment I thought I still loved you. Catherine! Didn't you like being with me last night? Didn't you feel secure? At least, you don't regret it? Tell me. Tell me! Yes, I can see it. You'd like to erase all this, like nothing happened! Because I'm a failure and you feel ashamed now! But so are you, you know? We're in the same boat. - We're equal! - You're hurting me! Look, the train is moving! Go! Get off, I'm begging you! I don't care! Do you hear me? I don't care! Don't ever come back or I'll kick you out! Hello? Very good. Just a moment. It's from Besan?on and it's written by Pierre Jaeger. Is it worth the trouble for me to read that letter? You don't have to bring it. Thank you. Sign it. Do you think it's all fair? She did what they asked because she was tired, because she was fighting all day and now she was leaving. But she felt something she hadn't known before... She felt ashamed. Miss! Miss! Miss, I wanted to tell you... I've just learned... It had to end like this... Yes. It had to end like this. He's dead, isn't he? Dr. Danielli shot himself with a gun at a restaurant at the Champs-Elys?es. Because of you... That day, destiny was particularly cruel to her. At the very moment she'd found a friend and thought that her nighmare was over, she didn't know yet what sort of ironic conclusion she was heading for. She had yet to find out what sinister fame he rendered her, this very Parisian doctor, by killing himself in the middle of the city. She suddenly recalled a man that she loved so much, who once predicted she would be famous, and would see her name in the papers. She, who dreamed of becoming someone to talk about... of conquering this terrifying city where she arrived one autumn night... very much like this one.
