First Came The Silence Have you ever seen your dad's willy? You want to see mine? It's big! You can touch it if you want. No. It's nice, you know. Not now. As you wish. Last night you did what I told you to do? You didn't? Yes, but it hurts. That's because you don't do it long enough to make it feel good. I'll show you how to do it. You have a pretty dress. Hold it. Oh! What lovely little navel! Ding dong, anyone there? Can I come in? Pommone! Good morning. Five, take two. Jack of Diamonds. Five of diamonds. Three and a five. Two of clubs. You're a dirty cheater and a dirty liar! I don't care, I won't play anymore. I'm gonna swim. Pommone! Pommone! Eric didn't put on his bathing cap and he goes in the water! Eric! Eric, just put on your bathing cap. Or I'll come get you! Pommone, Eric stuck out his tongue! For the tenth time Eric, leave Claire alone. I'm not a girl, I won't wear it! No cap, no swimming and some slaps for a bonus! Want another ear infection? Wow! It's pretty, miss Eric! Eric! She started! That's enough, go play elsewhere! What have I done to get such a boy! Well, later I'll never have a boy. You're right sweetie, it is better, just girls. Move over a bit, Clairette, you're in my sun! A friend of my father is here! I don't care! Ah, it is you, Étienne! You scared me. No. Don't stand there, make yourself at ease! Claire is not here? She plays there with Eric. For once they leave me alone! Sit down! I'm leaving. Shall we play 'Catch Me? Why that face? It is forbidden for girls here! If you want I can tell you a secret. You have no right to come here, it is forbidden for girls! It is prohibited for everyone! I risk nothing. I'm the strongest. My father is the strongest and he says that I can walk there if I want! Liar! You don't have a dad, you never see him! I'll even go with him tomorrow and you will be really pissed off! And my secret, you'll never know. Dad? Dad, my cake will burn! One moment, I take care of you. Anyway, I always have to wait for you! Claire, I only have two hands! You wanted cats, we must look after them. Oh- oh! Well, what is it? Nothing! Anyway it's too late! You'll never know! Didn't you have a nice day? Huh? You have a pretty dress my dear! Don't touch me! But why? Because, you're never there when I need you. My little Claire honey, I'm working! And then you were not alone today! Listen. I have an idea, tomorrow it's Sunday, we will do what you want, okay? Nine of hearts. Two of clubs. Four of spades. Three of hearts. Ouch! You do not have to be that forceful. I do it gently. I don't do it forceful! I did it like this all the time. It's doesn't matter I can't help it when torture is the rule. If you tell me your secret, there's no more torture! I swear, I won't do it again, cross my heart, hope to die. As you wish. Then give me another hand. Five of diamonds. Oh no, no diamonds! Double pike if you want, but no diamonds. Ouch! - Sissy! You hurt me! Sissy, sissy? - I'll tell my father! If you tell him, I'll tell him you have a secret that I don't know! Mom! Mom! Claire has a secret and she won't tell us! Is that true, Claire? Eric is mean to me. Come on, children, go play nicely. A secret you don't tell. Oh, but why? I'm sure it's a girl thing. And she'll tell me, huh sweetie? Pooh! I'm sure it's fake, she's a liar! But no, a secret is a secret, you just don't tell, Thta's what a secret is about. Will you put cream on me? Do me a Toto head. Zero, plus, zero, equals, the head of Toto! I'm burning. Ah yes, sorry. A bit higher, on the shoulders too. Aha, on the shoulders too. Adults are stupid, right? Good, what shall we play? Nothing. Here it's forbidden for boys. You're imitating me! I do what I want. No, it's me who found it, you find something else! This is the story of a little girl who can not speak. Is she mute? No, but she can not speak. she lives with her dad. And she made a cake. and when the story begins, she's watching the baking of the cake. Eric! Remove your cockroaches now! You have no right to do things that scare! But I can, since it's a game! But it's for me to choose where we put them! we will put them on Étienne and like that, when he comes close. Have you ever seen a willy? You've touched your dad's willy? You'll go to prison! You'll go to prison! No, not my dad's willy! nana nana booboo, nana nana booboo. I don't care! It's not me that goes to prison. It's the lady in front who has seen it all and even she said nothing! There's a spy lady? Yeah, and she even wears sunglasses. She's not a spy, you 're crazy, and she's not going topless, my mother! Oh no? And what about over there? On the beach, but not at home! Yeah well, my mother, she wouldn't even do it on the beach! Maybe you don't remember, you were too little when she died! It is not even true! Ouch! Get off me! If you take back what you said about my mother. She's not a topless spy! Never! Too bad for you! You have no right to touch my wee-wee! I'm not touching your wee-wee, we're fighting! Yes! You're like Étienne! Always touching me! Anyway it's bad to touch the wee-wee. or to touch the wee-wee of a girl. Étienne doesn't care. Why would you be different? Is it big? Are you crying? I'll say nothing to Mom, so you won't go to prison. You better say nothing, this is our secret. What are you gonna do? I don't know. That will surely hurt him! Yes! Because it hurts me! That's because you're a sissy! Don't sulk! If you want to hurt him, better cut him to pieces! With the scissors for the cats? I'll never! Not with scissors, that's not possible. And if I put poison in the cake? They will know you're the culprit! I know! I have to throw him out the kitchen window! He's too big! You cannot push him! He could drown in the Loire! What are you doing? Take it. We do not like icecream! It is chocolate. I don't like chocolate! I don't like strawberry! Well you're a difficult one. What are you playing at? We play 'Catch Me'! Claire! Eric! Help me! You're crazy. Mom! Come quickly! With both hands! Go get help! Girl, you're a crazy! Take hold! It's worse when he lives, sir. Give me that. And a little more. Go! Good. You're okay? Yes. What's the matter? There are cockroaches everywhere. Claire. Claire. He almost died, is that what you wanted? What did he do to you? Translation: Subransu
