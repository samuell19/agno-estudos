Glad you're here. ﻿Take your time. Just do it carefully at first. ﻿OK. ﻿Here's more. ﻿Hey. Getting the hang of it? ﻿Yeah. ﻿It’s monotonous work. A lot of people quit right away. ﻿But if you keep at it, I’ll think about giving you a raise. ﻿OK? ﻿Anyone who's determined deserves the chance to rejoin society. ﻿Keep at it. ﻿MUKOLITTA APARTMENTS ﻿Excuse me. ﻿I'm Yamada. Reffered by Mr. Sawada, my boss. ﻿I've heard. ﻿There are six-mat and four-mat rooms, a kitchen and a toilet with bath. ﻿The electricity and gas are ready. ﻿This is east. So this is west. This is north, and south. ﻿And I'm Minami, your landlord. ﻿It's 50 years old. Lots of people have lived here. ﻿But no one has died, so don't worry. ﻿Hey. I'm Shimada from next door. ﻿Oh... I'm Yamada. ﻿Usually the one who moves in says hello and brings snacks. ﻿But it's alright. Actually, can I use your bath? ﻿My water heater's broken and I haven't bathed in three days. ﻿It's getting really hot... ﻿You're thinking I should go to the bathhouse. ﻿I knew it. I knew it! It's all over your face. ﻿Those places cost 420 yen. What a rip-off! ﻿I'm a minimalist, so I can't really afford that. ﻿I know you just took one. ﻿What? ﻿You hear everything through these walls. ﻿I need a bath... ﻿No? ﻿Well... ﻿Just today. Please. ﻿No. I said, no! ﻿Y'know boy... ﻿When it comes to sukiyaki, I like mine Kansai style. ﻿You put the beef tallow in the pot, and first grill the meat. ﻿That brings out the flavor. ﻿Flip it over and grill it till it's about 80% done. ﻿Give it lots of sugar. ﻿Leave it for a moment, then add soy sauce. ﻿Sizzle... ﻿Hey, can't you just hear it? ﻿The sound of the meat soaking up the soy sauce and sugar. ﻿Yeah. I can. ﻿Yes? ﻿Hello. ﻿Oh! ﻿It's hot every day. Are you in good spirits? ﻿Are you some religion? ﻿Oh, no. I'm here with a special offer. ﻿During this sale, ﻿they're up to 40% off the regular price. ﻿Rest assured. No one lives forever. ﻿Making arrangements now will eliminate all your worries. We put our heart into our service. ﻿No thanks. And using your child like that is pathetic. ﻿Here's more. ﻿Welcome. Um, hello. My name is Takeshi Yamada. ﻿I received your letter... ﻿Huh? ﻿This is City Hall. We found your father’s body. ﻿He had been dead for several weeks. ﻿He was found after his neighbors sensed a foul odor. ﻿7 times 9 is 63. ﻿7 times 8 is 56. ﻿7 times 7 is 49. ﻿7 times 6 is 42. ﻿7 times 5 is 35. ﻿7 times 4 is 28. ﻿Yamada? ﻿Hey. Yamada? ﻿Yamada! ﻿You OK? ﻿Hey, are you alright? ﻿Ah, you're alive. You scared me. I thought you were dead. ﻿But this heat could kill you. ﻿It'd suck if my neighbor died. ﻿These are vegetables from my garden. I'll leave them for you. ﻿Oh, Yamada? ﻿Here. Good work. ﻿Hey, glad you're here. ﻿Lots of guys quit after a day or two. ﻿See you. ﻿Oh, and here's your uniform. Brand new. ﻿Take home some shiokara. ﻿Stick with us next month. OK? Hi. ﻿Oh, you're eating? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Good timing then. Here. ﻿- Thanks. - Not at all. Dig in. ﻿Say, if you want to thank me, could you let me use your bath? ﻿You just took a bath, didn't you? I'm filthy from working in the field. ﻿Well, I'd rather... ﻿The bathhouse is 420 yen. That's a lot. ﻿Let me. Please. ﻿But I'm not ready... ﻿You don't have to be. The bath's ready. ﻿- But wait... - It's all ready. ﻿No, no... ﻿Kayo! ﻿Dinnertime! ﻿OK! Hi. ﻿Can I have this? ﻿How long you gonna sleep? ﻿Oh! You bought a fan? You bought one! ﻿That's a shame. You should have bought an air conditioner. ﻿I found it. ﻿Then find an air conditioner! Silly. ﻿What? ﻿C'mon, get up. It's nice out. Don't sleep through the day. ﻿- Get up! - Knock it off! ﻿I grew those. ﻿In this tiny garden. Aren't you impressed? ﻿Can you help a little? ﻿Help me out. ﻿No. ﻿A little! ﻿I'm tired. ﻿Just a little. ﻿I said no! ﻿I grow lots of things here. ﻿Eggplants, cucumbers, tomatoes. The green peppers are pretty good. ﻿I give them to neighbors. ﻿Look. ﻿You see how poor I am. I'm just scraping by. ﻿So I'm self-sufficient in the summer to save money for winter. ﻿You're the ant from "The Ant and the Grasshopper." ﻿I'm not an ant! I'm a minimalist. ﻿A minimalist. ﻿It's a simple life, abandoning status and wealth. ﻿So that means... ﻿No. I'm not a bum. ﻿Lots of people make that mistake. ﻿I have a philosophy. ﻿A philosophy... ﻿But you need some money. ﻿Philosophy won't fix your bath. ﻿No, no. I’m not good with people. ﻿But look. All these beautiful vegetables. ﻿Feeling the soil and sweat. ﻿Eating the vegetables I've grown makes me happy to be alive. ﻿That cucumber. Just cut it and add mayonnaise, and it's amazing. ﻿Yama-chan, ﻿all you eat is salted squid every day. ﻿How do you know? ﻿Hey! ﻿Gan-chan! This is Yama-chan. ﻿Yama-chan, this is Gan-chan My old friend. Hi. ﻿Good work. ﻿You drink milk after a bath, not beer? You’re like a little kid. Could you stay out of my refrigerator? Oh, whatever. ﻿And please don't take a bath before I do. ﻿Whatever. Have a seat. ﻿I partake. ﻿Right? ﻿Good, isn't it? ﻿It's really good. ﻿This is happiness, right? ﻿Um... ﻿It is. Right? ﻿If you find these little bits of joy, ﻿they’ll give you the strength to endure. ﻿Even when you're just scraping by. ﻿If you’re poor and lonely, then you’re stuck. ﻿But if you yell, “I don’t have any money!” ﻿then it'll be alright. ﻿Is he also... what was it... ﻿Minimalist. ﻿No. Gan-chan is a monk from the local temple. ﻿You'd be surprised. He knows the chants. ﻿But people nowadays don't ask monks to do funerals, so he's struggling. ﻿He's a monk... ﻿Why? ﻿How much does it cost to call a monk for a funeral? ﻿Could be anything. Why? ﻿I got a letter from the city office. ﻿Asking me to pick up remains. ﻿Whose? ﻿My father's. Or so they say. ﻿Huh? ﻿My parents divorced when I was 4. I don't even remember his face. ﻿And? ﻿I was confused. ﻿I just left it... ﻿That's no good. ﻿What? ﻿That’s not good. It really isn’t. ﻿But he's almost a stranger. ﻿If I take them, I'll have to pay for the funeral and grave. ﻿That doesn't matter. ﻿I have no obligation to accept them. ﻿Whatever he was, ﻿you can't pretend he didn't exist. ﻿Social Welfare Section ﻿Hello. I'm Tsutsumishita from the Social Welfare Section. ﻿Right this way. ﻿Your father's body was found on the 20th of last month. ﻿These are his personal items. ﻿His autopsy was completed, and he has been cremated. ﻿Acceptance of Human Remains ﻿These are your father's remains. ﻿These are all.. ﻿Wandering spirits. ﻿We store them for a year, and if no one claims them we bury them together. ﻿Some of the names are unknown. ﻿That means... ﻿Homeless people, and the like. ﻿Sir... ﻿Were you present when my father was cremated? ﻿Yes. I sent him off. ﻿Was anyone else... ﻿Just me, aside from the crematory staff. ﻿I see. ﻿How did his face look at the end? ﻿It's very hard for me to say... ﻿Part of it is the season... ﻿He was in very poor condition. ﻿It was hard to determine ﻿the look on his face, or anything else. ﻿Oh... But after cremation, his Adam’s apple stayed intact. ﻿That means he did good deeds in his lifetime. ﻿Oh... ﻿Would you like to see? ﻿Huh? ﻿I should show you his Adam's apple. ﻿It's rare to see one in such a good state. ﻿Look. ﻿Doesn't it look like the Buddha with hands folded in prayer? Making arrangements now will eliminate all your worries. ﻿We put our heart info our service. ﻿You know... ﻿It's not the season, ﻿but can you imagine ﻿feasting on fugu blowfish sashimi in that nice house? ﻿Yeah. Sounds good. ﻿Crystal-clear cuts of fugu sashimi, arranged beautifully. ﻿Take three cuts with your chopsticks. ﻿Dip it in citrus sauce with ground radish and bring it to your mouth. ﻿Its texture is plump and firm. ﻿It's irresistible. ﻿Can you hear it? ﻿Crunch, crunch... ﻿Yeah. I can. ﻿Can't catch anything. ﻿Hey, you. ﻿It won’t be long. ﻿The light purple flowers will bloom. The perennial asters. ﻿Little flowers blooming everywhere. ﻿They'll look pretty if you tend to them, or turn into weeds if you don’t. ﻿But that's true with everything. ﻿Yes? ﻿What is it? ﻿For this month. ﻿It's all here. ﻿Here. For you. ﻿Huh? ﻿Most people don't pay on time. ﻿Oh. ﻿Be well. ﻿Aah, the smell of freshly-cooked rice! ﻿What do you want? ﻿A meal tastes better when you eat with someone else. ﻿I'm taking this to work tomorrow. ﻿OK. I'll just eat one bowl then. ﻿Oh, this... ﻿I got them. ﻿Good. ﻿Dad, please watch over Yama-chan. ﻿I’m sure he’d forgotten about me. ﻿You don’t know that. ﻿There were lots of them in the city office. ﻿The remains of those thought not to exist. Oh, really. ﻿Homeless people by the river. Some get swept away in typhoons. ﻿But it never makes the news because they're unidentifiable. ﻿Well, that's almost me too. ﻿I made these pickles myself. ﻿I partake. ﻿Delicious! You've got talent for cooking rice. ﻿Say, our landlord... ﻿Minami? ﻿Right. ﻿Where's her husband? ﻿What? You're interested? ﻿It's not that. ﻿Give up on her. She's crazy about her husband. ﻿I don't mean that. ﻿He passed away. ﻿What? ﻿He had cancer. Cancer. Took him instantly. ﻿About five years ago. ﻿But even now, ﻿she's devoted to him, adorably. ﻿How do you know? ﻿It's obvious. ﻿I wonder. ﻿What is it, Yama-chan? You think I can't understand women? ﻿Hey! Stop! ﻿You said you'd just eat one bowl! ﻿I wonder what your father was like. ﻿I’m sure he led a worthless life. ﻿Even caused trouble after he died. He was all alone. ﻿He died alone and no one found him. ﻿There were maggots everywhere, all slimy. ﻿The room was full of flies. His body was oozing fluids. ﻿He left a black stain on the tatami floor. ﻿Aren’t you going to eat? ﻿7 times 9 is 63. 7 times 8 is 56. ﻿7 times 7 is 49. 7 times 6 is 42. ﻿7 times 5 is 35. 7 times 4 is 28. 7 times 3 is 21.. ﻿Hello, this is Life Line. ﻿Hello? ﻿Is something wrong? ﻿Hello? ﻿You've got the hang of it. ﻿Right, Ms. Nakajima? ﻿If you stay devoted to your work every day like that, ﻿next month will come, then next year, ﻿and before you know it, five or ten years will pass. ﻿Is it worth it? ﻿It is. It really is. ﻿But to understand why, ﻿you'll need ten years' experience, unfortunately. ﻿They say do your best every day. ﻿But you won't understand without that experience. ﻿Take some Premium. ﻿Yamada, want some ice cream? ﻿Want some? Or not? ﻿I saw a pregnant woman. ﻿I can't stand them. ﻿When I see that big belly, I want to give it a kick. What... ﻿It depends on how they stick out. The one today made me want to kick it. A pregnant woman has another, different person inside her. How beastly! ﻿It's a visceral thing, ﻿but it reminds me people are originally animals? ﻿The thought of that makes me sick. ﻿I know it's strange. I was pregnant once. It's alright. I've never done it. ﻿Babies are adorable, and I know I'll never cross that line. ﻿But it scares me to think ﻿those feelings are inside me. ﻿People can be scary. I... ﻿My mood's much lighter now. ﻿HOLIDAY SALE ﻿No one lives forever. ﻿Prepare now and you will have no worries. We put our heart into our service. ﻿What? I'm selling tombstones. Would you like to buy one? ﻿I can't afford it. ﻿Of course not. ﻿Ah, that felt nice. ﻿Hey! ﻿I'd rather you just took a bath. ﻿Thank you, always. ﻿I partake. ﻿It's so good. You really have a talent for cooking rice. ﻿I wish I had other talents. ﻿It's something! ﻿What's this? Premium squid? ﻿Oh, wow! ﻿It's from my boss. ﻿Nice boss. ﻿guess. ﻿They glow at night. ﻿What? ﻿The remains. ﻿Seriously? ﻿It's creepy. ﻿He must be here. Cut it out! ﻿But make sure you have a memorial after 49 days. ﻿A service? ﻿Do I have to? ﻿Of course. ﻿But I don't have money for a grave. ﻿You can't just toss them somewhere. ﻿By the way, I saw the old lady next door the other day. ﻿What? ﻿You... ﻿You saw her? ﻿You really saw her. ﻿Minami was also saying ﻿the old woman still lives there, so she can't let anyone move in. ﻿Really? ﻿She's been dead for two years. ﻿Crap. I won’t sleep tonight. ﻿Whoa. ﻿This is bad luck. What's wrong? ﻿- Hello? - Maron? What is it? ﻿Settle down. Maron. Hello? ﻿What? Yes? Good day. It's hot every day. Are you in good spirits? ﻿May I help you? ﻿7 times 9 is 63. 7 times 8 is 56. 7 times 7 is 49. ﻿7 times 6 is 42. 7 times 5 is 35. 7... ﻿No. No. ﻿Not the toilet. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿I heard. ﻿I heard you almost tossed him into the river. ﻿That's a crime. Up to three years in jail. ﻿Don’t you know that? Throwing away remains is a crime. ﻿But if you pulverize them ﻿and scatter the powder, then it's not a crime. ﻿Really? ﻿Powder. Powder, Yama-chan! ﻿But why? ﻿I have no idea. ﻿Oh. What's that? ﻿Something smells good. ﻿Really good. ﻿Yama-chan! Come here. ﻿That’s sukiyaki, isn’t it? ﻿Um, er... No! ﻿You should have told me! I would have brought pickled vegetables. ﻿But... ﻿Sukiyaki's great! Isn't it, Yoichi? ﻿This is awful! ﻿We can’t survive if we don’t help one another. ﻿I don't have any money! ﻿Um, stop! ﻿Yama-chan! Don’t just stand there. ﻿But I... ﻿You may never get another chance to eat meat this good. ﻿Guys, come on! ﻿The eggs? ﻿In the fridge. ﻿Wait! ﻿Shimada! ﻿Is that any way to act? ﻿I don't have any money! ﻿l partake. ﻿Argh! ﻿But why are you eating sukiyaki when you haven't paid rent in months? ﻿I sold a high-grade tombstone for the first time in half a year. ﻿That's good. They must be rich. ﻿Well... ﻿The woman in the mansion on the hill. ﻿How much does one of those cost? ﻿More than two million yen. ﻿Two million? ﻿And... ﻿It's for her dog. ﻿Right, boy? ﻿Woof! ﻿This is so good. ﻿I thought I smelled something good. That's sukiyaki? ﻿You're six months behind on rent and eating sukiyaki? ﻿Is that so. ﻿Kayo, go get chopsticks and eggs from our house. ﻿OK. ﻿Good. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Oh, did you hear? ﻿Yama-chan saw Mrs. Okamoto the other day. ﻿Really? ﻿I don't know if it was her... ﻿What was she wearing? ﻿A purple cardigan. ﻿Even though it was a really hot day. ﻿She was smoking and her voice was raspy. ﻿It was her! ﻿Without a doubt. ﻿I knew she was still there. ﻿Did she say anything? ﻿She said the light purple flowers would bloom soon. Near the flower bed. ﻿That's her! ﻿She loved tending the flowers. ﻿What are you so happy about? That was a ghost! ﻿Even if she's a ghost, I want to see her! ﻿What kind of person was she? ﻿She had a beauty salon in this area. ﻿I'm not sure how long she lived here. ﻿She was here when I was little. So about 40 years. ﻿That long? ﻿In the evenings, she'd talk with the landlord under the oak tree. ﻿Right. They'd put out a bench. ﻿I have no idea what was so funny, ﻿but they'd talk and laugh, on and on. ﻿Nothing could stop them! ﻿Let's walk the goat. ﻿Mrs. Okamoto must have forgotten that she died. ﻿Hey, old lady! You're dead! ﻿If you see her again, tell her to come to me, too. ﻿Um... OK. ﻿Let's go, Asuka! ﻿That's a nice song. ﻿Bach. ﻿I can’t kill bugs. ﻿Especially spiders. ﻿My dad died when I was 10. ﻿But I have one vivid memory of him. ﻿I think I was about 3 or 4. ﻿There was a typhoon. ﻿I was too scared to sleep because of the howling wind. ﻿So my dad said, ﻿"I'll tell you a story." ﻿And for some reason it was... ﻿"The Spider's Thread". ﻿It's about people in hell ﻿who think they can climb a spider's thread to heaven. ﻿But... ﻿When they're almost at heaven, ﻿the thread snaps and they all fall back into hell. ﻿After hearing that, ﻿the wind outside just sounded like hell to me. ﻿I had a son. I lost him though. ﻿What? ﻿Just kidding. Pretend you didn't hear that. ﻿You can't just wait. We have to call them. Ah, this is too much. Let's rest someplace cool. ﻿Gan-chan! ﻿Gan-chan! ﻿Don't be scared. He's a good guy. ﻿This is like my garden. Just relax. ﻿The cicadas here... ﻿They're louder than other cicadas. ﻿Look at that huge slug! ﻿Hey, Yama-chan. ﻿Let's get drinks after it stops raining. ﻿I'm sorry! I'm sorry! ﻿Forgive me! I'm sorry! ﻿Let's go, boy. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Communicating with aliens. ﻿Huh. ﻿Shimada. ﻿I’m about to eat. ﻿Nice day, isn’t it? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Need help with anything? Sure. ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Nothing. You're working hard. Not really. ﻿It's too hot to sleep. I thought moving would distract me. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Say, Yama-chan. I heard about you. ﻿That you were in jail. ﻿What did you do? I conned people. ﻿I stole their money. ﻿Oh. ﻿Is that so. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿For you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Are you OK? ﻿Totally fine. ﻿Is being good-for-nothing genetic? ﻿My mother was trash. My father died a pitiful death. ﻿Is worthlessness handed down? ﻿It's not. ﻿You don't inherit things like that. ﻿But if she'd known my past... ﻿Ms. Nakajima wouldn't have done this for me. ﻿She's known all along. I told her. ﻿What? ﻿She's careful with her words. ﻿I've depended on her for decades. I completely trust her. ﻿Don't quit now. ﻿If you quit... ﻿you'll be back to nothing. ﻿You'll be roaming around wondering if life is worth it. ﻿I've seen lots of people like that. ﻿Use your hands, not your head. ﻿That's an order. ﻿Hello, this is Life Line. ﻿Is something wrong? ﻿It's OK. You can talk about anything. ﻿So... ﻿You're that thing, right? ﻿The line that people call last when they want to kill themselves. ﻿Well, it's true that many callers wonder if life is worth living. ﻿But that's not all we're here for. ﻿What else? ﻿Well, ﻿some people ask if it's OK to bury their pet cat in the yard when it dies. ﻿Children call us asking if there are really ghosts. ﻿Or where our souls go after we die. ﻿Where do our souls go after we die? ﻿Well... ﻿this is my personal view, ﻿and not as a counselor speaking... ﻿But when I was a child, sometimes I saw goldfish swimming in the air. ﻿For a while they would just float about in space, ﻿and they seemed to be swimming toward the sky. ﻿I could see those goldfish. ﻿Years later, ﻿I realized ﻿they must have been souls. ﻿There was no doubt in my mind. ﻿Damn. ﻿Unknown Person A ﻿Sorry to keep you waiting. ﻿I'm sorry to bother you. I need to ask you something. ﻿Yes? ﻿Um... ﻿Did my father... ﻿kill himself? ﻿Pardon? ﻿I checked the last number he called. ﻿It was the Life Line. ﻿Did he want to die? ﻿I cannot deny that. ﻿He died alone, so no one came to visit him, ﻿and he had no one to talk to. ﻿He sat alone for a long time, just listening to the TV... ﻿Say, ﻿would you like to see where he lived? ﻿Your father's body was found there. ﻿In my work, I've seen people who died in various ways. ﻿Many who die alone are found fallen facing their doors. ﻿Death comes to them suddenly. ﻿To escape their pain, ﻿they try to go outside. ﻿But those who kill themselves ﻿are often found facing inside their rooms. ﻿I was told that your father was neither of those. ﻿His room was relatively tidy. ﻿As you can see, he was growing plants on his veranda. I bet... ﻿he led a careful life. ﻿Sitting by the window... ﻿Oh, a half-finished milk was on the table near him. ﻿He may have just taken a bath. ﻿That means... ﻿He was my father. ﻿We're here! ﻿Daddy, here's some goldfish. ﻿Takenori Minami ﻿Visiting a grave, ma’am? ﻿Yes. ﻿I love tree burials. It's best to give them back to nature. ﻿It's nice to have different ways to mourn. ﻿They're all just ceremonies to heal the ones left behind. ﻿My wife, she danced in the night sky. ﻿I was a fireworks operator. ﻿When my wife died, I pulverized her bones with a mortar and pestle. ﻿I did them little by little so I'd get them all. ﻿My son was pretty creeped out. ﻿He thought I'd lost my mind. ﻿But she was the wife of a fireworks operator, ﻿so I wanted to send her off high in the night sky. ﻿I can't tell you how happy I felt when I was grinding her bones. ﻿I mixed her bones with explosives and put them in a huge shell. ﻿Then it went... ﻿BOOM!! ﻿Look. ﻿Wow. ﻿"Setsuna, tasetsuna," ﻿"robaku, mukolitta." ﻿I didn't think you'd come back. ﻿Why? ﻿I just thought so. ﻿I have nowhere else to go. ﻿Eggplants... ﻿They're art, aren't they? ﻿The brightly shining light illuminates the world ﻿All beings that pray to Amida Buddha are saved and never abandoned ﻿Can you see the goldfish in the sky? ﻿Someone told me once ﻿she saw goldfish swimming in the air when she was little. ﻿She'd stare at them, ﻿and they'd be floating in space for a while. ﻿They seemed to be swimming toward the sky. ﻿Those goldfish. ﻿Years later, ﻿she said she was sure they were souls. ﻿The souls of the deceased were swimming in the air. ﻿Oh. ﻿What's that thing? ﻿Wait for me! ﻿Take me with you! ﻿Take me with you! ﻿Take me with you! ﻿Take me with you! ﻿Where does our soul go after we die? ﻿Hey. ﻿Yama-chan, are you in the bath? ﻿That earthquake was big, wasn't it? ﻿Scary stuff. ﻿But I'm glad I wasn't at the top of Tokyo Skytree. ﻿Lucked out there. ﻿But they say Skytree's the second-tallest in the world. ﻿That's a letdown. ﻿I'm sorry about the other day. ﻿Look... ﻿I also... ﻿have a past I don't want to talk about. ﻿Sorry. ﻿Yama-chan.. ﻿Say something! ﻿You know... ﻿I'm really glad a fella like you... ﻿moved in next to me. ﻿See, I'm not really bright. ﻿I've been conned a lot. ﻿People took my money. ﻿So I got a little scared when I heard what you did. ﻿You know... ﻿when I die... ﻿if just one person is sad... ﻿that'll be fine with me. ﻿Yama-chan, would you be sad if I died? ﻿Yama-chan? ﻿Isn't it better... ﻿to eat with someone than to eat alone? ﻿Go ahead and eat first. ﻿Can I? Thanks. ﻿I partake. ﻿Yama-chan! The squid! It's... ﻿It's coming. ﻿7 times 9 is 63. 7 times 8 is 56. ﻿7 times 7 is 49. ﻿What are you saying?! ﻿This is how I overcome fear. ﻿say the 7 times table in reverse. ﻿It really works. ﻿Really? ﻿Um... 7 times 9 is... 64? ﻿Wrong! ﻿I can't do it! That's the hardest table! ﻿And backwards? No way! ﻿When I was little, I got scared when my mom left me home alone at night. ﻿I'd pull the covers over my head ﻿and say the 7 times table backwards, over and over. ﻿That made me less scared ﻿so I could sleep. ﻿I could say it if it wasn't backwards. ﻿7 times 9 is 63. 7 times 8... ﻿7 times 8 is... 54... ﻿No! 7 times 8 is 56. ﻿7 times 8 is 56. ﻿7 times... 7 is 49. ﻿7 times... 6 is forty-.. ﻿Two! ﻿7 times 5 is 35. ﻿7 times 4 is 28. 7 times 3 is 21. ﻿7 times 2 is 14. 7 times 1 is 7. 7... ﻿I wonder if the people by the river are OK. ﻿I hope they weren't swept away. ﻿They're powder. ﻿Yes, powder. ﻿Doesn't that feel strange? ﻿Not at all. ﻿This used to be a person, right? ﻿I... I crossed that line. One day when I was 15, ﻿I came home and my mom was waiting in front of our apartment. ﻿She gave me 20,000 yen. ﻿"This is the end for us," she said. ﻿She was... ﻿wearing lipstick that was the wrong color for her. ﻿All slimy like a slug. Gross. ﻿I haven't seen her since. ﻿Someone got me a good job... ﻿but I ended up in jail. ﻿But I was relieved. In jail... ﻿I didn't have to feel like I'd starve. ﻿So I got out and come to this apartment... ﻿And this weird guy is next door. ﻿He uses my bath and eats my food without asking. ﻿Sometimes I find myself laughing ﻿when I'm with him. ﻿But I know I shouldn't laugh because after all, ﻿I have no reason to live. ﻿That's how I felt. ﻿But I ended up laughing. ﻿This guy... ﻿he finds... ﻿these little... ﻿bits of joy. He has a knack for that. ﻿It amazes me. ﻿But he probably... ﻿couldn't have survived without doing that. ﻿You know... ﻿for an ex-convict... ﻿someone like me... ﻿those little bits... of joy... ﻿Do I deserve to feel them? ﻿Of course you do. ﻿Let’s have a funeral for your father. ﻿OK? ﻿MUKOLITTA APARTMENTS ﻿Oh, thanks. ﻿"Setsuna, tasetsuna, robaku, mukolitta." ﻿What is that? ﻿Minami said the same thing. ﻿Mrs. Okamoto used to say it a lot. ﻿"Mukolitta." ﻿I'm not sure what it means. ﻿It's probably... ﻿Like the color of the sky today, appearing and fading away. ﻿Maybe it's time passing like that.
