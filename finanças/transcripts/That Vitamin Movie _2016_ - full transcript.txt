i'm a man who doesn't surprise easily but a recent conversation with a friend not only surprised me that surprised me so much that it started me on a journey halfway around the world and left me a lot more than surprised by what i discovered i'm a filmmaker for forty years i've been producing and directing television news and current affairs programs and making documentary films i see myself as a modern version of an old fashioned storyteller the stories i tell are as varied as a human condition they can be funny sad depressing uplifting but probably the most important thing i can do is to sometimes present the audience with more than just information or entertainment with something that has the potential to actually make a difference to their lives never over four decades of i come across a subject with as much potential is this one to change lives maybe even save lives body dog and a lot that we're already seeing the western civilization smoke la mama of for the coming tsunami of chronic illness that were already safe thyroid cancer in the us is the fastest growing cancer here for of abreast is a korea one in seven women can cancel the prostate as a one in three men sickness is the biggest business on earth it's bigger than war kids on six seven drugs who are six or seven or eight years of age that's just an abomination this is something that can be remedied if you bring and vitamins to that gets any person who should not be dying from cancer don't die of something that not even our livestock a dime from through the entire history of live on the planet vitamin c is the reason that life was able to survive in progress the body knows what it's doing nobody believes us anymore the vast majority of americans are deficient in multiple nutrients why don't we pay attention to what's going on inside of her own body my journey began when a friend of over thirty years to make her his life had been suddenly and radically turned around he'd finally gonna handle on the depression that have plagued him for years quitting sugar was the first step that began to left a fog and the second step well trevor had watched a documentary called food matters and heard one of the contributors andrew shaw recommend treating depression with niacin that man be three because under was so credible in the movie and as i looked into his backstory there was no financial motivation for on the wasn't saying the things that were saying for any reason that he sold supplements or whatever so i literally got in touch with them through email and said listen i'm coming to the states i'm gonna be close to where you live would love to call in uncharted for half an hour they actually that wasn't particularly true i was gonna be in the states but it was a long way from where he was but he agreed on i spent half an hour some a told me i should also take be vitamins and chromium would help me on was to help of those things that really met such a huge difference to me if the key to tremors cure was something is simple as a bunch of vitamins my own doctors prescribing vitamins instead of drugs ireland where i live as one of the highest suicide rates in europe so what's going on terms experience made me want to find out more and one of the first stories i came across seemed little short of miraculous the new zealand alan smith was on life support his team of consultants agreed he couldn't survive and wanted to turn off the machine allen's family fought to haven't given huge doses of vitamin c e dramatically recovered that story inspired new zealand police officer i'm tom korea doctor said his acute myeloid leukemia was too aggressive for further treatment and they send them home to die he to started mega dose of vitamin c and he to recovered the more i researched the more stories i find of patience beating illness when medication and failed by taking doses of the demons hugely in excess of recommended daily a months i've always had a pretty good health and put trevor had gone through was making me think seriously about this for the first time i realize that most of us experienced medicine as the treatment of our symptoms rather than the underlying cause were ill health is it possible that nutrition country the root cause of sickness as well as the symptoms well why don't we try to find i trevor said meet some of the world's top that i'm an expert and see what they say should that's what we did andrew shaw lives modestly in a small university time in upstate new york an expert in nutrition with a p h d and human as somebody who's played his berlin and natural healing for over thirty years he's the best selling author of more than a dozen books translated into a host of languages high doses of vitamins event and cure real disease cancer can be a traitor with vitamins protect you are a enter venice vitamin c mental illness schizophrenia psychosis even attention deficit disorder fabulously treatable with high doses of vitamins alzheimer's disease can be reversed that was the word with fight amongst you have to use a lot vitamins can trade and any viral illness you can treat heart disease with vitamin a will this is certainly news to me i have i spent forty years as a journalist and filmmaker and never heard this an unusual to saying the proper nutrition can help prevent lot of these conditions happening in the first place the advice from conventional health authorities says why you should eat better why we're not we're just not so we're going to have to do something else and that means we're going to have to in addition to educating people right were going to have to get them to take supplements and take extra nutrients even if you are eating really well and have an organic plant based diet and really do everything right you're still not going to get enough vitamin say you're still not going to get enough vitamin e and edward so these have to be supplemented if people are to have optimum health where people have optimum health they don't get sick or they don't get sick as often or if they do get stuck they get better and if you use really high doses of vitamins you can actually reverse the disease so you have vitamins says prevention and then you have vitamins this treatment i've always accepted the standard message fast food is bad fresh fruit and veggie good because that's where we get our that amongst the minerals is often the salt fat and sugar get some exercise and hope you don't have a hereditary killer lurking under genetic makeup if you do get sick go to the doctor he gives you something to make your well but obvious telling me there's decades of research to show that filaments can work as well as sometimes better them prescription drugs four sixty five seventy five years there is a long track record of well qualified physicians that have already done this we already have for the proof and mega vitamin therapy is safer than drugs more effective than drug use and cheaper than drugs but because we've been taught to be consumers and modern medicine we can't believe that anything safe and shape can be a factor or anything cheap and a factor of can be safe if we have modern medicine continuing the way it's going we're gonna have a study of what happens when you put poisonous chemicals and malnourished bodies what i can't understand is why assuming all this is true the medical world isn't treating people with filaments so successful and so well documented why isn't that common practice well ambitious it's because nutrition has never been part of medical training even today isn't of that suits the pharmaceutical companies just fine doctors are well meaning people who have lots of education and they're very busy and they have a belief system and their belief system is that if they don't know it it's probably not worth nine the rest of us have an equally problematic belief system because we believe that if the doctor doesn't know and it's not worth knowing there's a defensive almost a bunker mentality that we have to use conventional medicine and of conventional medicine doesn't work there's nothing else you can do if you limit care to a single party system driven by the pharmaceutical industry and people are still dying by the hundreds of thousands and millions and eight millions every year something's wrong so if someone's dying of cancer and they've never been offered nutritional therapy that is criminal it is equally criminal to fail to educate physicians so they would be able to make the offer i'm going through my life believing in traditional medicine that the doctor knows best but one of the people have come to florida to meet is a doctor who turned his back in the last thirty years ago from daytona beach he runs one of the biggest medical web sites in the word the website that last year attracted an incredible he eighty million visitors i love people who aren't afraid to step on toes and tackle the system and he is certainly one of those he's confronted the sd a the food and drug administration many times and has the warning letters to prove it dr ju mer cola you seem to be quite a controversial character no know that that that is absolutely well i am a controversial but what of the things i love it it doesn't have you told you seem to like being a sore and than the side of those who inject yes that perception is correct i have committed my life to exposing this fraud this deception and life is short and i acquired enough resources to be comfortable and i don't need anymore so i'm i'm the can actually committed to each to generating an informational educational campaign that will expose the true so that people don't have to die needlessly and suffer painful miserable death at they don't have to offs for the primary benefit of improving the bottom lines of the large corporations that's what we seek to do on the side is to provide people with simple inexpensive national therapies that will address the foundational cause of disease and also expose the fries and the scams that lies the deceptions that industry puts out there to deceive people to take them away from the simpler almost invariably less expensive rogers in his early career joe was dispensing medication like any other doctor and i switched until he realized that much of what he was doing was applying a barely effective banned it he had started as medical career fool of enthusiasm for natural healing really but i was brainwashed in the traditional system even though as passionate about health i got caught up in the process that to the pretty much brain washes almost every one of those to medical school and that drugs are the and surgery or the primary treatments for all disease they failed it virtually ever understand or recognize or treat the foundational causes of disease why are more medical professionals not aware of this well it's not by accident this is actually by carefully plan designed because there are the medical industry is what is i believe it's the largest industry in the united states with literally trillions of dollars three trillion dollars a year annually so there's lots of revenues and as a result of that there's incredible incentives to discuss courage approaches that would take away from their revenue stream medical schools get a lot of money from drug companies the media gets a lot of advertising revenue from drug companies researchers get a lot of research grant money from drug companies and government is lobbied to a tremendous extent by drug companies so we have this situation where the pharmaceutical industry has way too much and foreign somewhat doctor smart from the need springs in florida say or g runs green man info he provides easy access to natural mention research documents and the otherwise difficult to navigate national library of medicines so far he's covered seventeen hundred different topics share suffered a range of illnesses since childhood and eventually broke free of medication using nutrition my understanding of modern medicine as it's really no longer related to the art and science of healing it's really about trading commodity out of disease and symptoms and it's a very effective model because of course when you suppress sent them often of chemical poisoned and with a new patented chemical called a pharmaceutical what you're doing is creating an even deeper condition that's going to sprout up in new symptoms which are treatable so it's an infinite growth model sarah who's been a it but some of the research papers he uncovered yeah one study really blew my mind which was when they took a cancer cell in a petri dish and they administered vitamin c with they found was that the cancer cells sort started to differentiate back into a type of cell i was healthy so it started to actually go from my cancer cell to and noncancerous sell just by administering a little bit of vitamin c and so what that showed me was that you know often times his research on vitamin c killing cancer but sometimes it's more a matter of it just we educating the sell to behave in a way that supposed to your your hairstyle you're a hard sell your liver so here's a nutrient that it needs to do that i have one final visit to make in florida to someone else who was let down by traditional medicine over many years before making a full recovery through taking charge of her own nutrition looking at out of the elizabeth it's hard to imagine the catalogue of problem she carried since childhood chino helps others overcome the kind of issues she still find it difficult to talk about was on his in to me how many especially women out there there were who were like me on for just have given up hope and had on put on a lot of weight and just felt like there is no there was there is there's not going to be in that there there was no light at the end of the tunnel that there was there there was no fix and does so i like to help them with the information that i can provide to arm turn their lives around because at i was kind of at the point where i felt that i'd hit rock bottom so what's the starting point for someone who feels as low as aaron wants did so never give up hope that it might be a rough road because for me it took a long time and it's not necessarily going to be overnight even with my weight loss i it to you know i may have been ninety days but it took me a long time to even get to the point where i knew what the heck was wrong in order to make the changes to get better to lose the weight dr alan gaming has seen many patients recovered dramatically where traditional medicine field he adopted a nutritional approach at the outset of his career forty years ago he's now regarded as one of the foremost authorities in the world and of the acclaimed author of the nutritional bible this incredible piece of work covers four hundred illnesses and is based on a lifetime impersonal practiced and assessing every piece of research he could find having seen about six thousand patients having reviewed analyzed and critiqued more than thirty thousand and research papers i can confidently state that nutritional medicine is a safe and effective alternative or in some cases and adjunct or addition to conventional therapy in my own practice of the six thousand patients i saw and many of them had failed conventional medical treatments are not tolerated the treatments eighty percent had worthwhile improvement i mean most of the chronic illnesses i can think of of the nutritional and environmental component to them a lot of people don't tolerate refined sugar many people have hidden food allergies hidden meaning are not aware of them and when you with delphi them and talk them into removing them from their diet their chronic conditions get much better or go away and many people have a higher than normal need for various nutritional supplements either because of genetic factors or because as the environment they don't tolerate or because the disease itself sometimes increases their names or because the medications their on increases their needs so when you have an individualized program of nutrients and diet's i would guess and this is a guess but it's it's an informed guess that if society where to embrace a nutritional approach and that the patients were willing to follow the recommendations which are not always easy that the cost of healthcare in this country would drop within a couple years by at least fifty percent back home in belfast i have two beautiful granddaughters thinking about their future makes me think about my own i want to be around for them as long as possible but i'm also interested in finding out if the experts think there's anything i can do to benefit their nutrition they've already needed medical treatment as did my children when they were small i raise my kids all the way into college and they never had a single dose of any anabolic not once not ever the kids did occasionally get sick but not as often as their friends and when they got sick we did something about it we gave him very very high doses of vitamin c which works as an antiviral an antibiotic and antihistamine and and a product which means that lowers fever and an antitoxin this this this is physiology not philosophy it works my children now have said to me that they're going to do the same thing with their kids and my daughter is i wondered with the passage of time that andrew perhaps if you his daughters childhood years' through rose tinted glasses does hello nicole things the way he does we were raised in a household where vitamins and nutrition where the answers to our health problems and not only did we take them to prevent issues which was ideal but if we got sick we took vitamins and we use nutrition tell feel better and we did it without drugs we did it without antibiotics and i know my father says and hills say it and until he can't anymore that we were raised all the way into college my brother and i both without a single dose of an antibiotic which is not something many folks can say and to this day so far i can also say the same for my children and my son is a little over one and my daughter's over the age of three and so far they haven't had to take an antibiotic and the key is we haven't needed to take one i'm not against medicine but i am against taking it if there's a better way and more healthy way and and there is so helens clearly on message as well but if what they're telling me is true it surely this kind of information can be buried him some sort of conspiracy by the pharmaceutical companies and while andrew certainly engaging and passionate why should i even listen to him instead of accepting conventional medical wisdom after all he's not even a medical doctor huh well if you want to medical opinion you should go to a medical doctor and if you have a medical issue you should go to medical doctor if you want to learn about nutrition and how it works i'm not sure a medical doctors your go to person my background is education not medication my training us in the sciences and then and teaching i've tried every grade there's all the way from first grade through postdoctoral we need to learn what to do and no one is telling you on tv no one is telling you and bucks or move vase no one is telling you in a doctor's office how to use high doses to cure disease and nobody's gonna tell you how to get about tolerance of item vitamin c nobody's gonna tell you how to reverse multiple sclerosis with high doses of vitamins nobody's going to tell you exactly how cancer traitor with vitamins no one's going to tell you exactly how to reverse arthritis or vitamins and no one is going gonna be a able to tell you which doctors did it this isn't my knowledge i stand shake or youngest and shoulders of giants these are real doctors that did this for twenty thirty forty fifty sixty years and this information is lifesaving i don't think i can stress that enough because this is information you're not getting your doctor's office and even if your doctors really good they're not going to sit down and talk with you about high doses of vitamins to prevent and care illness and my dad is dedicated his life to bringing this information to people and doing so without getting paid by any vitamin com penny's he just does it because he knows it's the right thing to do and it's going to help people so much see i believe as as many people practice this type of medicine that our bodies were designed to stay healthy we are focusing our if left to it's own means a given the right information and foods our body will go towards healthy it does not go naturally to disease we're not designed to be sick were designed to be healthy the key though is to provide your body with what it needs so the it's understanding that giving them the right foods are frequently in that the central core of that is eliminating processed foods eating real food ideally fresh shh locally grown and organic would be the best and eliminating lots of the sugars and there and the grains in the flowers and because those disturb the insulin resistance and they perpetuate these cracked agenda disease arthritis peptic ulcer anxiety depression joe still takes the time and makes the efforts to grow some of his own food restaurant he you really recommend sprite and sunflower seeds start just or to come up and so this is maybe three days after was a seed yeah and in another vast majority well over ninety percent ninety five percent of your food should be freshly prepared real food the simple rule is that someone either you or your spouse or someone you employ has to spend some quality time in the kitchen there's just no way around it and me that's by design if you rely on industrial processes to prepare you for who you are going to die prematurely and most likely come up with a whole variety diseases that you you are not going to want to to have arthritis or ulcers are you name it heart disease cancer diabetes these are all you're going to have an increased risk for if you have a diet is predominately full of processed foods when you read these studies and you realize some people go into remission just by getting vitamin d or vitamin c think oh my gosh this is the magic bullet have been waiting for and then over time i started to look more into food and the power of it to provide not just material building blocks for my body and energy but information packets of seen regulatory information that are able to make my dna work better and as i got more into it i realized that had to come from a really good so source like organic in age and soil biodynamic farming and so i would start focusing on eating foods that made sense in terms of the history of my body as agriculture has become more industrialize the nutritional value of food has decreased joel says it's exceptionally difficult to get all we need from food so we have to take supplements starting with that i'm in d and that i'm and see almost everyone's going to benefit from some type of regular so vitamin a supplementation that will literally epee genetically influence about three thousand of our genes to improve in and optimize health three thousand and she just ten percent of arch our genes vitamin c is is another great nutrient i think if you haven't made the transition to our commitment to up a healthier on who died than you may want to consider that because of this getting that in a regular for me even from a synthetic version is going to be better than i can eat at all i have to admit i'm impressed everything i'm hearing seems very plausible but smarter people than i'll have been duped by fig doctors and quacks could andrew the i'm relying on very much be leading me up the garden path it's all college professor doctor john mosher certainly doesn't believe so my first met and the when he was sixteen years old and he was a sophomore at the state university of for college at brockport and he came to my office because evil interested in going overseas to study science he was a pre medical student at the time oh going from that sixteen year old young man in my office who eventually went to australia the study science and canberra university he has become one of the foremost experts in the world and i've seen him develop from we're struggling not being helped by family friends or society in general and he persisted and what he knew his rights are like davy crockett said when you when you're when you know you're right then go ahead i had about of and fines are not too long ago and this is what happens to anybody when they get run down or they don't follow the rules are they too much pizza and i was taking thirty thousand milligrams of vitamin c per dose and years after think about that for minute that sex rounded teaspoons of ascorbic acid at one time thirty thousand milligrams of say per dose and the symptoms for gone and was some two days just the economics of this make an interesting what of companies didn't have people out for a week with a flower two weeks with a flow think of the money they'd say but think of a pain and suffering it safe that may sound like a lot of the and see andrew was taken but he's adamant that even huge doses of settlements will damage you won't cause kidney stones i'm definitely won't kill you when we walked and to this very carefully we were able to say no support whatsoever for the notion for the legend that anyone has ever died from taking a vitamin if someone finds that evidence i'd like to say it every year and the united states alone the most conservative estimate is that eighty thousand people die from medication properly prescribed and taken as directed just in hospitals this does not include medical errors this is not include intentional abuse that this does not include patient noncompliance this does not include anything but the straight and narrow there's just no way you can be comfortable with that because that puts prescription drugs taken as directed and properly you just and the top ten killers of americans i'm in new york to meet a psychiatrist who no longer prescribes pharmaceuticals but only natural medicines she realized totally on filaments and other supplements and is very successfully treating the women who make up the bulk of her patients her first step because a thirty day or whole food diet and she finds out alone can have dramatic effect dr kelly brogan i still find it shocking that a given patient who has been essentially polluting her body let's say for the past three four in and five decades can undergo such impressive clinical change in the space of thirty days i find it nothing but a testament to the resilience they have of the human body that's kelly's experience that we all need supplements just to stay well let alone who are sick i love the idea using food and only third i think it sounds romantic notion and i think there probably was a large swath of human history where that was absolutely the only medicine needed alla hippocrates right the unfortunately and particularly over the past one hundred and fifty years like say since the industrial revolution we have done quite a number on our environment and have essentially rendered ourselves sort of our subjects and an uncontrolled experiment because of this i think that it's imperative to support native physiology with supplementation you know from from glandular some micro nutrients to fatty acids to provide a i think it's a requirement even for for wellness let alone for for healing the new jersey doctor derek de silver to something of a celebrity with his own television and radio show he to successful treating patients nutritionally and he strongly believes we all need at least three supplements the three things that i have all of my patients do or probiotics vitamin d and omega threes why probiotics sixty percent of our immune system resides in our intestine the good bacteria or probiotics are responsible for digestion elimination and making most if not all of the b vitamins that's number one number two vitamin d vitamin d has numerous effects but the most important effects our number one has an a pop topic effect and it has an anti and your jannik effect what does that mean a pop toast this is the natural death of abnormal cells cancer cells number two is that it has an heir to a jelly cassette meaning it blocks the formation of new blood vessels for the spread of various cancers because that's how cancer spread a number three omega threes why sixty percent of our brain is fat that's where the word fat it comes from right because our brain is all set at the entire nervous system is coated in fat so dropping these cholesterol levels too low is going to affect your brain function but not only that having omega threes having the right fats in our system is critical as we get older for hormone production testosterone for men estrogen for women so without adequate levels of fat not only is your brain like going to function well but also your hormones are going to get thrown off what i'd like to suggest that people do is to one small go to a health food store patronize and first of all it's nice because the small health food stores deserve your business and secondly they smell great and thirdly the run by people that i think really care about what you're doing if i had one wish i would ask everybody to get four or five thousand milligrams of vitamin c and i i think that would change the face of health care as we know what i think we'd live longer and feel better the body takes them about three dozen nutrients totally but you're made out of forty trillion cells and there are thousands of chemical reactions in the body many of these reactions were only occur in the presence of a vitamin vitamin prickly our co enzymes that means they work with an unsigned which a reaction if you remove and find him and it doesn't happen andrew do certainly puts a great deal of cs and for them and see not just for chronic illness of all kinds but even for a sore to what tell you what's your story is wow about fifteen years ago broke my toe was healing but forefront of three four months and to and i still had some pain so i happen a car and be about out or maybe something else so he says take vitamin c get up to barrel tolerance which i did in the space of a week that home stopped hurting and hasn't bothered me sense would you say you took large doses what sort of dumpsters normally act around between and twelve thousand and fifteen thousand milligrams a day and for how long did you keep out a week about a week and within a week i had no more pain and laptop and it hasn't bothered me sense ever well a good really really it is what's thank you very low to the well well heeled to what exactly change the world my troubles are certainly giving me a new perspective and fact i believe i'm becoming a convert i'm accepting most of what i'm uncovering of course i find individuals and groups critical of andrew soul and the others and a question the whole validity of mega dose therapy but i'm definitely coming to the conclusion that the evidence speaks for itself my next job as a few miles outside london to visit a health researcher writer and international speaker from the english countryside he publicizes medical studies the mainstream media ignores studies by doctors and scientists around the world demonstrating the powerful benefits of supplements philip day i'm very very passionate about this whole idea of a mega vitamin therapy i've seen the doctors get very excited about it everyone from the doctors in america using it for the high dose intravenous therapy for cancer and they using heavy amounts seizing hundred grams a day upwards through to high dose fat diets for epileptics and depression vitamin d therapy a nice and therapy for depression vitamin a emotion therapy for cancer you know these some of the top clinics in the world are using these types treatments now acknowledged internationally as a natural health expert phillips's the mean conditions people ask him about today like cancer depression fibromyalgia chronic fatigue hypothyroidism all have a common route these a twentieth century problems these problems that the road into prominence during the early to mid part the twentieth century which coincidentally or otherwise was when we began to heavily refine the diet's and flood chemicals into the system he says the authorities today often treat fitment therapy the way they treated the first notion of lines to prevent scurvy had you walked into the admiralty what passed for the british admiralty who lost one million sailors between sixteen hundred and eighteen hundred had you walked into the admiralty said all you need to do to solve the strategic problem with your navy right is to add lines to the provisions you would have been hounded down the street very similar to delay and yet is that the truth of course it wasn't true oh it's so there's a classic example of make of it i'm in therapy applied in the eighteen hundreds which had groundbreaking implications for modern medicine and yet you know it was completely blanked it was completely blank to this been blank today what does fill up a lot with his wife and young daughter practice mega dosing most we have a policy in our household that everybody takes vitamin d and enough of it vitamin d is so primal in in in the way the cell operates that underpins the immune system and cellular repair and the bottom line is in britain we live in the country that hasn't seen the sun since nineteen sixty eight everyone's vitamin deficient we've got four to five million people with brown or black skin living in a country where they aren't getting adequate sunlight and if have ronald can you need a lot more sunlight to make the same amount of vitamin d than a fast can count for instance am so vitamin d big issue that's the elephant in the living room right that the very first thing so from age eighteen months and i started some a great it's supplementation of vitamin d she goes to school where kids are dropping left and right from whatever is going round and doesn't drop i we've got parents coming up same why does your daughter not get sick and the bottom line is she's taking vitamin c and she's taking she's taking her age and grams of vitamin c a day she's taking her body weight multiplied by forty of vitamin d three every day and that's ongoing way she goes mrs may college that i attended between nineteen seventy and nineteen seventy four the state university college i was a very young man when i started college as only fifteen and as word course spend four years to get the bachelor's degree one of those years was in australia of the australian national university some time after that i came back and dead a master's degree at brockport as well and then ultimately some years after that i taught here and the how science department i consider myself to be and of the ringmaster of the greatest nutritional show on earth and i feel that i'm bringing people in to their big top and i'm giving i'm a show which they didn't expect that's better and more important than they ever imagined and i'm not the key prior i'm just the impresario and i say and ring number one we have a broom hoffer and ring number two we have robert cathcart and ring number three way of frederick rapper climber and coming in and next half hour we've got doctors well for the he showed we have all these are these physicians doctors who spent decades of their life healing people with high doses of vitamins and they all report of the same sang they said vitamins are better in drugs they're safer they are practically no sign of facts nobody dies from vitamins they're cheap they're effective and they get the cure a quicker and for those who criticize this i say what part of this bothers you i mean what what is wrong with healing people at high doses of vitamins toronto on the forty fourth annual conference of the international society for also molecular medicine simply put nutritional meds doctors and nutritionist from all over the world gallo to share the latest research and catch up a new developments a diverse group united by their belief in the power of nutrition david bernstein describes himself as a holistic medical practitioner combining the best alternative untraditional treatments he says iodine deficiency is the direct cause of the cancer epidemic an american of six thousand patients it analyzed over the years ninety six percent were deficient in iodine i've talked your practitioners around the u s outside of the u s in in almost every major western country they're saying very low i had a levels and iodine is necessary for proper brain function for a proper thyroid function for heart function for and or can function mean every cell in the body needs and requires iodine david took the traditional route through medical school but after just six months and practice his outlook changed i realize that something was wrong that i wasn't really trying the underlying cause of my patients illnesses and that more importantly they weren't getting better and i was having to treat them with one drug to treat the problems of another drug and another drug to treat the problems of those drugs and more importantly they just weren't getting better from their illness and i thought i couldn't do this for the next thirty or forty years david's first steps and holistic medicine were actually treating his own father with some dramatic results my father had his first heart attack at age forty second heart attack and forty two by the time i finished medical school and residency he had a couple a bypass surgeries and three or four angioplasties he was and twelve different medications to control blood pressure and diabetes and hypertension he was having continue angina for over twenty five five years and the to natural therapies i try to my father were natural thyroid hormone and natural testosterone and within seven days of putting my nose therapies is twenty five year history of angina melted away never to return his cholesterol or three hundred's and cholesterol lowering medication fell below two hundred without changing his horrific and in a lack of exercise and more importantly my father looked better and acted better no longer to do look i was going to die at any moment we were able decreases medicine load three quarters really wants i saw that changes my father i knew that was a type of medicine i wanted to do for the rest of my life my own mother live to ninety but spent the last years of her life suffering from dementia i asked david for an example for the similar female patient he treated but the vast majority of patients especially the elderly are markedly division of vitamin b twelve it helps three things like alzheimer's and and pernicious anemia and confusion in and mental decline and my history part of the exam she was taken stat medications which are known to cause memory problems and people and and mile laboratory analysis of her she had very low vitamin b twelve levels so when i met back with them to go over the results i prescribe two things for her hi hydro's vitamin b twelve and coenzyme q ten because she was on the stat medications and i told him to stop this that medications and within three or four weeks or memory started the return than two or three months she was back to normal able take care of herself able to go to the grocery store and was off all the other medications that she was on and you know that that's one example of patients that we see all the time such as the diverse nature of conference delegates that the next person i met there's a canadian m p james loney a former chiropractor committed to natural interventions and nutritional supplementation for his patients he pointed me to very practical example of how the medical establishment in canada is resistant to supplements trying to shut down a half million dollar university study treating three thousand patients for bipolar disease now because we were able intervene in that file the substance is still available its vitamins and minerals and amino acids but health canada do their best to shut it down putting the health of thousands of canadians at risk because many people come off toxic a chemical substances being managed and conventional care and they didn't want to go back on the conventional drugs that recovered their life they're working they're happy and many them with a sport of the medical doctors but the system is very resistant to looking at simple things that that start approved or managed by the conventional system on gyms view of what we all need to do everybody needs of the amid a vitamin supplement for a quality one and my worldview and you certainly should be supplementing with vitamin d we could save fourteen billion dollars a year and healthcare costs just by elevating canadians levels of vitamin d but if we follow health canada guidelines they say one one thousand is enough it's not the experts that are recommend i'd take five thousand the day and cancers down mental health azov ah almost any disease you want to name is down because vitamin d three is so important to physiological functions that diversity of or some molecular experts on the subject matter of the papers they're delivering was in my head again when he met tom levy he has the unusual distinction of being a cardiologist and an attorney no my father died from a heart attack on i happen to have had a long running common fiction so tom's presentation directly linking mice infection to heart attacks as a tool i'm scared the pants off me it should it should but more than frighten you it should after you've thought about it a while alleviate a large amount of your stress because just like the positions most if not all a people think getting a heart attack is bad luck getting cancer is bad luck getting any chronic degenerative diseases bad luck and i what ha the data now shows luck has nothing to do with it that in fact a root canal and the periodontal disease is the direct cause not correlation cause of heart attack ninety to ninety five percent of the time what made this so compelling was in two thousand and thirteen a research group in finland showed very elegantly i mean i couldn't have put together a more elegant study they actually suctioned out the blood clots in patients that presented with heart attacks sucked out the blood clot open up the audrey and then analyzed the blood clot and using very sophisticated pcr testing that can really detect minute amounts of nucleic acid dna are they they were able to show not only did these blood clots contain the same typical pathogen profile that scene and root canals and infected gums but they are able to show that that blood clot had a sixteen fold higher concentration of these pathogens than the blood sample the arterial blood around it tom says with them and see can help in at least some cases of dental infection he studied it and used it for many years i've had a couple cases of infectious mononucleosis college aged kids that were literally sick for months and needed to drop out of school because they were so ill that somehow found out about me and the potential benefits of vitamin c and both of those individuals were completely clinically resolved within forty eight hours by giving intravenous vitamin c infusions i was able to play a role in and a case of acute lyme disease not chronic acute where the classical lesion came up after the tick bite and then a really horrible syndrome and that was able to be resolved with the five or six days of interviews vitamin c now this is vitamin c and a lot of people think that five hundred milligrams and or thousand milligrams of vitamin c is a mega dose will this is a thousand one two three four five six seven nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen don't want to overdo at sixteen thousand milligrams of say and it's time to take it and this is not just for the benefit of the camera know i don't always takes sixteen thousand milligrams per dose i always take at least that much per day in divided doses were such is best for most people but if you're set or if you're under stress and that would be me this time we've done a lot of filming traveling done a lot of talking i feel just a slight seconding swelling in the throw it fair just a little better soreness in the throat so i'm going to get out in front of this and follow my on and nice if you're in good health that might do it if you have hepatitis that wouldn't do it same human being different circumstances or guy sang for see well was much now i just prefer to five hundred milligrams tablets a vitamin c chewable vitamin c is for kids can she would have been these and weren't is only true and so he's getting a thousand milligrams of vitamin c at every meal and every snap say that again a thousand milligrams a thousand milligrams every meal every snap so i'd say on average more and at the age of two gets four to five thousand know grams of vitamin c a day on a normal day on a normal day right so when there's even a hint of a cold or you not sniffily know his or his knees we increase that dose and i basically give him enough and tell or country enough until they are symptom free food some parents may i feel that's an awful lot of vitamin c for to very small children it is but what's great about vitamin c is that there is an indicator you know if they've had too much because they start to have lose bowels now obviously with children you don't want to have lose thousand and diarrhea cousin they get dehydrated that's not what we're going for literally so are are or yeah no figurative so what we want is to have just enough sent they feel good and you get the result now helen's about to publish a new book to follow her first dealing with some sensitive womanly issues such an uncomfortable topic for people to discuss none nobody really wants to say anything about it because you know it's kind of gross but that's the whole point is that we're kind of shy and then we go to the store and we get that medication we go home and we take care of our yeast infection and we hope nobody knows about it but ladies don't have to do that we have another way you can treat infections naturally by taking once again mega doses of vitamin c and other and taking other immunity builders and infection fighters like a vitamin a and vitamin e making sure you get enough vitamin d i'm also honor and to be part of a doctor actually and i guess i was book of radiation and vitamin c therapy for that and he's a just a brilliant man with with groundbreaking research that people really need to know about and i'm so excited to be part of that of of that project under seal yanagisawa the remind physician helen is writing a book with has come from japan to the toronto conference he's making a presentation about his success using that them and see to treat girls who have suffered adverse reactions to the hpv vaccine designed to prevent cervical cancer to give me one case study congo with mercer boosted my could nuke and she says she has a involuntary movement and conversions is severely very severe cumbersome his leg and arm and baby also trim always show when and i tweeted her first twelve point five grams of vitamin c and the next ten to five girls vitamin c it's quite high dose was goes but is really effective hi many doses to do you give someone an doesn't go on for days or weeks or longer it at first i tweeted her was twice a week sin once a week and sometimes tens oh and every ten days a to has also become widely known for his work in the wake of the fukushima nuclear disaster using mega dose that them and see to neutralize the cancer risk for workers there we gibbs said vitamin c five to ten grams and or source we are the administered a vitamin c into been us v every two weeks so two months later also cancer discuss school return to normal levels the themes vitamin c can you to rice said cancer risk as scores a one of the most important vitamins we are using is a vitamin c both orally and intravenous at their high those his of the intervenors vitamin c have shown to v very very beneficial to people because they help the to have more energy they have better mood and in general they have a bury a health of fielding thousands of diabetic people people with hypertension with cancer with depression when anxiety and many other just he says because this therapy is helpful for almost all the diseases i often use vitamin c the b vitamins specially wagner vitamin b three i find very interesting and some inroads like him a nice human the zinc can be good addition vitamin d one of my first patient say when i used to hide those know niacin what was a man who are had been on a let's see i'm another conventional medications for several decades so i decided to give him niacin and then increase is slowly till three grams a day we were able to take away the anti anxiety the benzodiazepine and the is sleeping drug and i hadn't thought of that time that yeah we would be able to take away listen but the patient asked me and we decided two very slowly when he have been on miocene for javier try that and off some weeks he was better in the morning i wouldn't take a magnesium time on this is a form of magnesium that's easy to absorb it's called my news and saturate and sonic spencer magnesium oxide as a bad choice can absorb that and about this is coenzyme q ten you think of it as an energy coenzyme this is some mixed antioxidants said are especially good for the i this is niacin a five hundred milligrams niacin time one doctor abrams half would say take two of these a new so i do four hundred units of vitamin e isn't eddie this i will take twice a day for title coin is important in your body because you absorb the coin and you make the neurotransmitter acetylcholine out of it it's good for the skin are it's been shown to help reduce the symptoms of dimension and improve short term memory other i forget where i learned about an announcement this is a somewhat natural high potency multi vitamin for it to be high potency you either have to use the laboratory products in there or you'd have something the size of a football most vitamin research uses laboratory vitamins and they still work with the exception of vitamin a where you have to avalanche often not everybody wants to take a handful of vitamins they should at least take a multi i think you need a multi vitamin with every meal this is chromium chromium mr trace minerals that helps to regulate blood sugar this is a zinc book can eight and easily absorbable form of sank men need more in sync because they were saying in seminal for this is a be complex capsule this is all the be vitamins again like the multiple in one convenient location this is a probe ironic supplement i take this because it contains more strains maybe ten or twenty strains of beneficial bacteria and yogurt has fewer and finally we have vitamins a and day and you can pay a lot of money for this but these are very inexpensive kept source of and day and i take a number of my father could take this without any water at all but that i cannot do michael guns others has a lifelong passion for basketball he plays and he's encouraged his son to do the same in fact the older ones turning out tonight with professional team they are more precarious michael is also quite possibly the man behind one of the most dramatic events and olympic basketball history back in two thousand and four the porta rican team manager had heard her michael's were treating cancer patients with that i'm and see was increasing their vitality i'm two days before their olympic qualifying game against canada he leans for the players to have intravenous vitamin c multi vitamins and supplements against the odds they won so they beat canada two days after they had this therapy is it into been as a vitamin c and the supplements and they were very happy but the story doesn't end there is that when they went to the olympic games and greece they had to face the united states dream team which is the more spheres team basketball team in the world and they beat them by nineteen points and it was the first time that the dream team loses an olympic olympic competition in puerto rico did that and having a be vitamin c in their veins so but i haven't come to porto rico to talk basketball this is where the theory of metabolic correction has been developed the belief that nutritional supplements can fine tune or bodily systems right down to the metabolism of sale that certain nutrients have the capacity to turn jeans on and off and why we kind of older our genes we can change hi those genes express themselves michael gonzalez and jorge miranda sorry believe cancer isn't metabolic disease and they have been successful treating it nutritionally their passion comes from direct experience jorge lost his wife the mother of his two young children to counter michael lost his grandparents and his mother the cancers cut of your body it's your body going weird so we have to bring it back in well how we do that we changed their environment that produce that weirdness you know and the way of doing that it's by diet and supplements you don't just kill sales like chemotherapy and radiation will work in a certain way but it doesn't improve mortality what he does his daddy it reduces tumor it will give you response so is good to have response but it's even better if you if you decrease mortality and improved survival that's what you actually want you don't want just to improve momentarily because if you have response but dang are damaging your immune system which is the one that takes care of detecting up normal cells and eliminating them then you don't have the protection from the body so that's why you have recurrence first and if you're giving chemotherapy and radiation you're not correcting the root cause which is a metabolic energy problem that's one thing and the second you are harming the immune system so when when you look at the root cause of the problem and you're correct that then you have a better chance but i'm and see it's it's really a neat molecule because it's something so simple that sometimes we have problem with the physicians understanding how important but him is he could be because is some sort of a simple what you know the main thing is that it looks like it's it's structure in terms of stricter it's similar to sugar so that's one of the mechanism that cancer cells use because cancer cells have more glucose receptors so when you know have glucose there they think vitamin c as glucose or they bring him in and in the presence of oxygen you have to agents to accidents and you produce hydrogen peroxide which kills cancer cells and doesn't do anything to normal cells because they have the enzymes inside to break that down so that's one of the issues it looks like glucose but it behaves different in the beginning many years ago the it was a problem like a lot of people didn't believe in our work didn't want to even listen and that but nowadays more more people are open to the idea that is true because there's more and more evidence and there's someone called is now there are using supplements to improve energy the and correct the metabolism and even vitamin c as part of the cancer treatment this is vitamin b twelve now there is be twelve and the be a complex there is be twelve and the multiple you get beach twelve and yogurt and meats and and dairy products and fresh by be twelve is needed more as we get older and men in particular and elderly man and particular in particular seem to have more and more trouble absorbing be twelve and for that reason i'm not going to swallow this one this is martha combat on on which is a farm a beach well that's easier absorb and required under a calm and he arrived and solve so there's all this mean you're gonna let the hundred and forty and never get sick no it means that our wealth hopefully to be hundred and forty and i'll still get sick because everybody gets sick it's not about getting sexpot getting better i don't take these because i'm afraid of getting sick i'm taking this because i don't want to be sick i'm going to me sick every one sec that's just where it goes the track is how you get better and if you do it up right would you be sec was often sure while i love to be hundred and forty probably not but i'd settle for a hundred and twenty for some molecular medicine seems to be very male dominated world shoot the conference i'm glad to find prominent american m d like has she's an expert an integrative medicine psychiatry and addiction recovery and she's one of many to be hugely influenced by the man whose names come up more than any other and my conversations the grandfather of also molecular medicine able to offer or was brilliant because not biochemistry he knew at the time was really good but we have even more knowledge now to show how really correct he was and what an amazing amazing contribution he made and it is such a shame that what happened was of course pharmaceuticals came in around that time and of course that wiped him out because a final will win every time supplements are important because even if you're eating a good diet are organic food even does not have the same nutritional of amount of vitamins and minerals the same values as they did say twenty years ago i mean i remember how tomatoes his to taste i remember they don't taste like that anymore even organic ones other that those are better is certainly a better and more also fighting were fighting pollution it's everywhere your the pull the bears in the arctic her it has evidence of pollution this no way to escape it so what we have to do a take vitamins minerals antioxidants many many different ah supplements in order to counter the pollution to counter and detox so that we can maintain our house i probably came into the field more dishonestly than anybody else avram hoffer was my mother's younger brother and so growing up he was a psychiatrist and whatnot i know about psychiatry and it was just part of my life i'd heard about uncle labor monk labor i'm and it just seemed logical over the times that i was with him our family events and so on i wanted to do what he did as a psychiatrist gary becker deals with a range of illness but for forty years his passion has been schizophrenia which he treats nutritionally but not always exclusively in the most severely ill patients you absolutely have to use medications where the vitamins become very important and even the traditional literature supports it is you reduce the side effect burden you can reduce the dosage of the medications and if you get a patient early enough patients can be rough dropped down to a very very tiny amounts of medicine so what were his uncle's mean discoveries that have had such an impact now hoffer interestingly enough was the very first person to show that if you take niacin you can lower cholesterol and now there are cardiologists giving niacin with the other drugs because it turns out to be a very good cholesterol lowering agent but of course the drug companies make it look like niacin is dangerous where's the stands are so called safe it's really not true then they discovered vitamin c is an extremely important antioxidant and then they looked at be six and said women bishops is vital to every single nutrient a interaction and our bodies they're like cool factors and i tell my patients if you've seen the ads on television for detergents that have enzymes what or enzymes will there are things that make the equation move more efficiently they're like additives to your car if you want to add a little bit of stp or whatever they call it make it more efficient it doesn't get necessarily used up at it makes everything else more efficient so that's the whole principle and from i'm from the fifties till now it's been refined give them how for some john is a respected college professor in his own right john has continued research and vitamin c and amazingly discovered a huge number of hospital patients are severely lacking ours is a typical tertiary care sophisticated cute hospital and sixty percent we showed a year after year of the patients had subnormal vitamin c levels one in five patients had blood levels compatible with scurvy is that is that really skirving or is that something else and what are the implications no one knew it because no one it looked and when i pointed it out to other people it was just so far out of their radar screen that they just to sort of registered and forget it as is typical of new ideas now abrams hoffer had as a patient bill w the cofounder of alcoholics anonymous that's the bell debut as and hi my name's bow and i'm an alcoholic don't yeah it was a patient of doctor offers while build up your started taking niacin because of depression severe depression that often is unfortunately part and parcel of getting off of alcohol especially long term years so build up oh chuck abrams advice much as wise and he took three thousand milligrams of niacin and day and his depression was gone and a week so bell talk to friends of hers and said hey you gotta try this and they took vitamin b three niacin and about a third of them had the same results they're better and awake and another third were better and about a month and another third didn't notice much difference but to build up you two outta three people with alcohol depression being carried with niacin in one week to four weeks was pretty good so bill wu on his own letterhead at his own expense an independent ave wrote three papers on the importance of niacin and trading alcoholism an alcoholic depression or abrams offer was a very precise man everything that came out of his mouth emanated from a very biochemical world view it doesn't mean that he wasn't personable and lovely and nice and kind and he had a quick quick weird about on he was really i'm just quite funny and humorous but he really saw the world from a biochemical perspective a new really felt that with good nutrition the ticket hello the optimal doses of different micro new trance he could really modulator person's biochemistry and such a way that they would have better mental and physical health when i give somebody treatment it's really individualize to what it is that they want help with but i use things like niacin which is vitamin b three i use center fatty acids i use magnesium i use basically all the b vitamins be the twelve in particular i use vitamin c i use you name it basically there's about forty a central micronutrients that we need every day and i try to individualize as best as i can what micro nutrient combinations would help a patient than i'm saying with mental health issues that have better emotional regulation so jonathan shocked me talking about just hide damage doing some psychiatric drugs can be to patients they'll typically live on average ten to twenty five years less than somebody is not on the anti psychotics so they reduce lifespan which is something that they're never told about when they actually are given the drugs in the first place they get metabolic disease so they have problems with her heart they have problems regulator in their blood sugar and they often gain huge amounts of weight i had presented with the development of humankind over the past fifty years things would be much better than they were during even hovers career but sadly that doesn't seem to be the case the current climate of of mental health care is abysmal is just is just and is just god awful psychiatric drugs are not correcting any by a camera cool problem they're actually creating biochemical problems in the brain and it's a result of how they disable certain processes in the brain that they didn't answer sufficed symptoms people are now culture eight into believing they need all these drugs so we have a socio cultural phenomenon that sort of makes people believe they need these drugs to be well when the evidence is not does not support that so people of and sold lies about how psychiatric drugs or that are actually helping them when in fact all they're doing as disabling various brain processes as a to the intensify symptoms jonathan's particularly concerned about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder it's become a catch all diagnostic label we're seeing now and a huge over inflation of who gets that label and as a result we're seeing an over inflation of who is being prescribed psychiatric medication and to me it's nothing short of is disgusting is despicable it's inhumane we should not be dragging our kids particularly when their brains are so vulnerable they're developing what they need is a tuned and pathak loving care that has to come from all avenues of their life most of the time and kids are expressing the symptoms of a d h d seeing what they're really expressing his the distress in their lives i don't know what to say i don't know how to say except it breaks my heart it's not the way highly industrialized world should be tending to the most vulnerable most parents because they are born into this very medically dominated world they come to believe now that the only option is dragging and that somehow it's fixing a biochemical imbalance the only imbalance it's fixing is the imbalance of the parents feel because they're overwhelmed there is no defect in a child was a d h d and up child's brain it's never been found that it never will be the only defects that are found our kids who are on medication since that's when you get different changes within the brain and different changes to how the brain functions andrew shows first teaching job wasn't in college it was in prison two prisons in fact albion and orleans correctional he discovered the inmates have pretty appalling giants so he gave them some advice about improving things so that's what they did they stopped eating sugary foods and they put which i'm on pretty much everything and they took a cheap multi vitamin every single meal one day after class i guess it was two or three weeks later this really big inmate was on his way out through the door and it was a job because he was taller than the door was so he had a duck and he was wider than indoor was so he had a turn so is docking and turning and he stops him he turns around he looks sent me and he says can i talk to you for a minute and i said yeah i've been doing that multi vitamin every meal that you talked about and i said yeah i just wanted you to know and i feel more clear and he laughed and i fought over the years what would be the long term benefits of more inmates becoming more clear and present you can get those vitamins for five or six cents a day probably cheaper if you buy him and bunk remember that every one that's in jail and wash there and for life all of those inmates are gonna be coming out at some point it would be nice to help fix them up nutritionally we spend fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars per inmate per year to put him in jail and keep on there for another six on sunday we could help him feel more clear there are some illnesses that respond to fairly low doses one of the most interesting ones was sir with hiv positive man at johns hopkins very reputable institution back in nineteen ninety three and they studied two hundred and eighty one hiv positive man for about six and a half years there is it took vitamins were only half as likely to develop aids now if there was a drawing the affected that you would a heard about it but a lot of people watching me right now have never heard of this before gets better about ten years later harvard y'all have heard harvard harvard did a study and show it exactly the same thing that hiv positive people who took vitamins were about half as likely to develop full blown aids but the harvard study showed something else that was interesting a twenty seven percent decrease in deaths from aids the final interview of my troubles is with a man who's probably been responsible for more vitamin c mega dose infusions than anyone else he's the chief medical officer of the reardon clinic which had been treating cancer patients for forty years wrong humming hack i recently estimated that i have overseen probably one hundred thousand intravenous vitamin c infusions didn't mean i actually did it myself but i have done about three hundred on my wife because i would do her at home and she had a great vain and i i called it old faithful in two or three nights a week we would after she got home from teaching i would just hook or up and and so i she would sleep better she felt better she not only had breast cancer she also had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue so in many ways her journey through the cancer illness actually helped her to improve on the chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia because all the vitamin c and all the nutrient changes that we made to help her get through that cancer regimen was actually good for helping her heal the other chronic illnesses ron believes there's a way to improve a week genetic blueprint using his own family as an example it looks like a mess i'm it looks like i should be diabetic right now because i have three uncles that are diabetic i have my father became diabetic my grandmother was diabetic i have a cousin first cousin who's already lost a foot to diabetes i have a brother that's diabetic and yet i'm not why not because i've been engaged and diet supplements exercise meditation stress management all these things have a meaning in terms of helping us prevent illness or recover from illness and once you start putting that all together we have a tremendous healing system that standard medicine can't really touch as it come to the end of my journey into the world of mega victims ron also has an encouraging message for the future as he liege new research into individual patients genetic needs it's where we do you know make studies of each person find out what their genome their epigenetics is because then we can start matching nutrient blood levels which we do a lot of it the reardon clinic with their genetic situation and their symptoms and what they've noticed about themselves and we can start to create a grand synthesis caliber a symphony of changes that really helps their body come into of a full musicality i guess is the only i me where where your orchestrating all the elements standard medicine is all about treating symptoms putting band aids on problems now we're looking at the root causes and finding ways to correct that and give people an opportunity to live not only to a hundred but i a golden one hundred not this thirty years of chronic illness the most people have at the end of their life it's a fascinating prospect to live to one hundred with food mental and physical function kind of fitting end to epic journey of discovery for my fellow traveler trevor and for me this has been life changing we're both paying much more attention to her diet undertaken more supplements than ever before nutrition has helped over to take the final steps to completely get out from under the shadow of depression this experience open the door and started a journey which is unlikely to end here launches see full she go to guy's hospital in london they have mcdonalds in the food court if you go to adam brooks hospital up in cambridge which is the last word in cardiology teaching in the northern hemisphere you have burger king next to a sign that says blood tests this way miracles can happen because the body is a self healing organism see and me to really took care of ourselves and if give the body what it needs it will do the job then i could only go along with that power line of not you seem vitamins if you live in paradise figure you know with no stress it you have your personal chef if you know any and your personal trainer don't take chances take vitamins that's what you need to do anything
