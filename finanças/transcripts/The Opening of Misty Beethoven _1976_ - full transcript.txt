These street scenes were shot on location near Place Pigalle in Paris. Place Pigalle is Paris' Red Light District. The opening theme, "Mighty Atom“ by Steve Gray, is used repeatedly in the film. The street footage is 35mm, but most of the film was shot in Super-16mm. This “porn scene" in the opener was shot in the assistant editor's apartment in NYC. The main actor seen here is Jamie Gillis, playing the character of Dr. Seymour Love. Gillis was born Jamie Ira Gurman. He got his start acting Off-Broadway. It was constantly raining in Paris during filming, which delayed and complicated the shoot. Metzger: "We spent many hours waiting for the rain to ease up between shots." The interior of the porno theater in Paris is actually a small theater in downtown NYC. Now the Lucille Lortel Theater, it is located on Christopher Street. The porno actress appreciating her own on-screen performance is a typical Metzger flourish. Many of these extras appear later as high-brow patrons at the ballet. The actress in the white t-shirt is Susan Jensen, AKA Constance Money. Misty Beethoven was Susan's breakthrough role, catapulting her to stardom. Conflicting stories exist for the origin of her "Constance Money" stage-name. A common claim is that Metzger coined it as commentary on her constant demands for payment. Metzger disputes this account, insisting that the name was mutually agreed-upon. Constance Money performed in only a handful of adult films in the 70's and early 80's. She got along well with Gillis in person, adding to their on-screen chemistry. Sex scenes involving mirrors or cameras/projectors are a staple of Metzger's adult film work. Misty's credit-card t-shirt is one of Metzger's many nods to sly social commentary. Misty Beethoven' is an adult-film adaptation of Bernard Shaw's play "Pygmalion." Metzger acknowledges “My Fair Lady," another Pygmalion adaptation, as an influence as well. The film actually follows the traditional structure and cadence of a Musical. The “brothel" was one of several sets created at RKO studios by art director Anton Stone. The film's working title, "Society,“ again points to Metzger's fondness for social commentary. Metzger frequently fashioned his screenplays around wealthy elites to remove job and money concerns. Metzger coined the "Misty Beethoven" name, hoping it would be memorable. Assistant editor Bonnie Karrin came up with "The Opening of“ part of the title late in post-production. Earlier titles included "The Tale Of Misty Beethoven“ and "The Coming of Misty Beethoven." The latter title was in use so late in the process that the title screen had to be re-shot. Jacquelin Beaudant plays Dr. Love's sidekick, Gerladine Rich, in her only known adult-film role. The extra in a t-shirt and beret is adult film legend Michael Datorre. Dattore went on to appear in Metzger's next film, Barbara Broadcast. Dattore is considered one of the funniest character actors of the golden age. Metzger frequently allowed actresses in his sex scenes to remain partially clothed. He also enjoyed reversing gender roles, as here with Geraldine as the female client and Dattore as a male prostitute. The music here is "Bourbon" by Brian Bennett, from KPM 1163: Rock Spectrum. 100 Francs in late 1975 is, coincidentally, roughly equivalent to $100 USD in 2012. As 100 francs clearly means nothing to Dr Love, his bargaining with Misty was for purposes of his research. Auto rebates were introduced in the 19705 to counter low demand due to the Arab Oil Embargo. "Nadir" refers to the absolute lowest position something can take. "Annals" in synonymous with chronicle or history, but puns nicely with “anals” in context. Metzger's love of wordplay often features in his dialog-- here a pun on (giving) head vs "get ahead." The Goldenrod Girl would be equivalent to a Penthouse Pet or Playboy Playmate of the Year. The “bet" here parallels the one in "Pygmalion" and "My Fair Lady," forming the backbone of the story. This track is "Teorema" by Italian composer Bruno Nicolai. All of Metzger's adult films are scored with production library music, a sort of musical stock footage. Metzger collaborated with Music Director George Craig to select music for his films. Craig's "Music Soundtrack Service" was located in the same building as Metzger's cutting room. Outdoor scenes in Paris and Rome feature stand-ins for Misty, as Money did not fly to Europe. Metzger counts Misty's "Dolores Beethoven" line among his all-time favorites. Jamie Gillis was terrified of flying, but was the only cast member who flew to Europe. This airplane scenes were all shot in an airline mock-up used for training flight staff. The stewardess seen here is played by well known porn actress, Jenny Baxter. In the script, Misty replies to "First trip?" with "I tripped with my brother when I was 16. It was at a dance. I learned a lot from that trip." This music is “Giovane Flirt“ by Italian composer Alessandro Alessandroni. This is footage of the UN building, FDR Drive, and Sutton Place in New York City. The iconic set of Dr Love's apartment was built in the machine shop at the RKO studio at 106 and Park in NYC. Set construction on this scale was essentially unheard of in the adult film industry. This music is “Going Great", composed by Franco Bonfanti. The track is from Conroy Eurobeat 11: Colla Voce, a rare LP of Italian sublicenses which can fetch $150-200. It was titled "Ippica" on its initial release LP: "REBUS n. 7" by Pinciana Records. This extreme rarity can demand four figures. Although the script was perfect for Gillis, Metzger originally intended the role for Tyler Horne. Metzger wanted to avoid using recognizable porn stars like Gillis, hoping 'Misty' could be a crossover mainstream hit. While footage of Home as Dr Love was shot, Metzger eventually relented and gave the role to Gillis. Constance Money was a relative unknown, having had only small parts in two minor adult films and one stag loop. The ejaculate in this sequence was actually egg-whites thrown by the director, off camera. An extraordinary number of takes were shot, prompting complaints from the leading lady. The “cool" / softcore version of this scene features a dildo instead of a penis. "Cool" or softcore versions of adult films were created for use in more restrictive markets. The inconsistent patchwork of indecency laws made creating a legally 'safe' cut challenging. Metzger put unusual effort into his 'soft' cuts, correctly anticipating a future market on cable televsion. Metzger shot additional dialog sequences for the softcore version of Misty to make up for lost running time due to cuts. This set is at the same RKO Studio at which Metzger got his start cutting trailers for Janus films. The neighborhood around the studio had gotten so dangerous that it was desperate for business. At $200 per day, including the machine shop, the studio fit even within Metzger's shoestring budget. However, the cast and crew had to employ dozens of pre-arranged taxis in order to arrive and leave safely. Fearing potential lawsuits for obscenity, Metzger made use of a sequence of aliases. He used "Jake Barnes" as his writing credit-- a reference to the protagonist of Hemmingway's "The Sun Also Rises." Other crew-members used aliases to avoid running afoul of union rules. This line is a reference to Hamlet: "The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." Magazine mogul Lawrence Layman is played by Ras Kean, credited here as Ras King. His name is a reference to having lived for a time among Rastafarians in Jamaica. His wife, Barbara, is played by adult industry legend Gloria Leonard in her first role. She was working as a make-up artist before Metzger cast her in the role to fill an unexpected vacancy. "Naughty Marietta" was a 1935 musical starring Jeanette Macdonald and Nelson Eddie. One of its songs, "Oh Sweet Mystery of Life," is referenced memorably in "Young Frankenstein." Metzger: "Having trained actors on the set, like Gillis and Baxter, made it a joy to direct." Leasing an airplane for filming would have cost thousands of dollars per day, well beyond the film's budget. Instead Metzger secured an airline flight-training shell, which much cheaper to rent. “Cascade Flight 111" references a real (if tiny) airline which Operated hop flights out of Spokane, WA from 1969-1986. The stewardess here is Mary Stuart, who had a major role in Metzger's previous film, "Naked Came the Stranger." This passenger is played by American actor, Mark Margolis who appeared in Brian De Palma's "Scarface." He also appeared as Tio Salamanca in "Breaking Bad" and had prominent roles in Darren Aronofsky's films. The actress seen here seducing Misty Beethoven is Tia von Davis. She worked in a handful of adult films from 1975-78, sometimes credited as Gayle Peters or Gayle Schafer. She worked with directors Carter Stevens, Joe Davian, and Roberta Findlay. To make a "cool" version of the scene, cinematographer Paul Glickman simply re-filmed with the camera at a less revealing angle. The music currently playing is “Bourbon," composed by KPM regular Brian Bennett. It appeared on KPM 1163: Rock Spectrum, the source of several tracks used in 'Misty'. Bennett was drummer for British chart-toppers "The Shadows" from 1961 onwards. He also played in "Marty Wilde and the Wildecats" as well as"Wasp," a quintet which included KPM saxophonist Duncan Lamont. He is still active, completing a 2009 tour with The Shadows at the age of 69. Establishing footage was shot in Rome using the same crew Metzger utilized for “Lickerish Quartet... Part of the driveway scene is shot in 35mm and part in Super 16mm. Although in the film Geraldine's “shack in the country" is near Rome, the mansion used for filming was in Deal, NJ. The Mercedes Benz in this scene belonged to Metzger himself, equipped for the film with foreign license plates. Interiors of Geraldine's house were also shot at the same Deal NJ mansion. The lavish estate was reportedly built using materials and workmen brought over from Italy. This scene was shot on location at the Piazza Venezia in Rome. This is not Constance Money, but yet another body double, hired in Italy. This track is the finale of the "William Tell Overture", composed by Gioachino Rossini. The actor in the tux is Ian Morley, who is only credited in 3 adult films. The footage of the passenger stepping into the car was shot on the Spanish Steps in Rome. His white straw hat is used to connect the exterior footage shot in Rome to the car-interior footage filmed in New York. The William Tell Overture may be best known for its use as the theme song to "The Lone Ranger." Dr Love refers to “the ballet" and Barbara Layman refers to Misty's exploits at "The Firebird," but the William Tell Overture is part of an Opera. The opera house is actually a set, constructed and assembled at RKO studios. To allow proper camera angles, the set was constructed on an elevated platform. This is the bathroom of the original Theater de Lys, in Greenwich Village, NYC. It is in the same building which stands in for the interior of the adult theater in Paris. Besides the 2 main actors, there were 4 crew members crowded into the bathroom. Metzger had to hold up the coat tail of Alfredo's jacket to keep it out of the frame. Metzger's Henry Paris films often make use of pieces of classical music for humorous effect. "The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann" featured oral sex set to "Swan Lake." “Naked Came the Stranger" featured "Flight of the Bumblebee" each time the lovers rushed to an adulterous tryst. Metzger excelled at incorporating large numbers of talented extras in non-sex roles. The filming in Paris was done with a borrowed crew provided by director Max Pecas. Metzger had collaborated previously with Pecas on "The Image.“ Metzger also shot inserts for Pecas' 1964 "La Baie du Désir." Metzger insists that the names of Barbara's gossipy friends are random and aren't intended to evoke anyone specific. The calliope music used here is one of two pieces of still-unidentified music in the film. The “Gossips" provide roughly the same function in the film as a Greek Chorus. They where positioned adjacent to recognizable landmarks to give the film a more obviously international feel. It is rumored that the role of Barbara Opened for Gloria Leonard due to Gillis' live-in girlfriend backing out at the last minute. The three great pieces of Italian music were sublicensed via London-based Conroy's Eurobeat label. Distribpix was unable to locate this mansion in Deal, NJ. It is rumored that it was torn down and replaced. Cinematographer Paul Glickman shot this scene using a shoulder-mounted 16mm rig. "Misty" predates the industry adoption of Steadicam, making steady handheld shots exceptionally difficult. Gloria Leonard, who plays Barbara Layman, was editor of "High Society" magazine. In this scene we get to see the NYC Gossips, with Queens, NY in the background. The owners of the Deal, NJ estate were in attendance at the world premiere of "Misty" in NYC. The lawn area filmed here is adjacent to the estate's remarkable 13-car garage. This piece of music, used at several points in the film, is one of only two tracks that remain unidentified. Library music does not require a credit, so tracks must be identified by ear. Chiang Kai-shek was a political and military leader in China for much of the 20th century. "A box of poppers" refers to amyl or alkyl nitrites, used recreationally to enhance sexual response. This outdoor scene was shot at an unidentified location in Rome. Tanya is played by legendary adult film star Terri Hall, who was a key figure in the NYC adult scene. The make up girl in the background is Bonnie Karrin, one of the film's assistant editors. This was an original make-up/dressing room at RKO studios at 106 and Park, in NYC. The make-up room has since been replaced with a hallway. Terri Hall was a trained ballerina and worked at American Ballet Theater. This street shot, meant to be Geneva, is Minetta St, located in Greenwhich Village, NYC. In a deleted scene for which we only have slides, Tanya provides a scale model of the studio to aid in planning. In one interview, Gillis insists that this suit is the same one he wore in "The Story of Joanna“. It was a bespoke suit commissioned by Damiano for use in the film. Cinematographer Paul Glickman insisted on lighting sets to mainstream film standards, even with his bare-bones crew. This often delayed filming, to the consternation of the cast. This scene finally started filming at 2am. This track is "Heat Haze," by John Cameron from KPM's legendary "Afro-Rock" LP. Cameron wrote multiple number 1 hits for Donovan, including "Sunshine Superman." He received an Oscar nomination for his score for "A Touch of Class" and an NBT award for arranging and conducting "Les Miserables". Cameron co-founded Collective Consciousness Society, which created the theme-song for "Top of the Pops." This scene incorporates several of Metzger's trademark twists on the standard sex scene. The acts are being recorded and will be played back and mimicked later. A main character observes the action but does not participate. Gender roles are subverted, with Geraldine standing in for a male partner and Tanya referring to performing acts on Geraldine's "cock." Dr. Linda Williams analyzes the gender dynamics in this scene in great detail in her seminal book "Hard Core." "Misty Beethoven" was one of the most important films in prompting the creation of the "Porn Studies" field. 35 years later, the film is still screened and discussed as part of the curriculum in many Porn Studies programs. Terri Hall was from the East Coast and was born in Elmira, NY. She began her career in the adult film business in the early-to-mid 1970's. Hall starred in many Distribpix films, including "Seduction" and "Once Over Nightly." She was a solid actress and worked with the best directors, including Metzger and Damiano. One of her most memorable roles was co-starring with Jamie Gillis in Gerard Damiano's "The Story of Joanna". Hall was a prolific performer in the late 19705 adult film scene. This track is "Confunktion", composed by Dave Richmond, from KPM's "Rock Spectrum" LP. Richmond is best known for his work with jazzy Brit-pop band "Manfred Mann." Like many KPM regulars, he was, for a time, a member of "The Shadows." KPM stands for the Keith Prowse Music Group, a London-based music library label dating back to the 19605. KPM's famous 1100 series provided music for many well-known films, commercials, and TV shows in the US and UK. A notable example: the classic Spider-Man cartoon was scored almost exclusively from the KPM 1100-series library. Library Music is used and re-used in many contexts, meaning today's porn music can be tomorrow's toothpaste jingle. And vice-versa. “The Big One," featured prominently in Metzger's "Barbara Broadcast," later became the theme song to "The People's Court.' Library Music is almost never sold directly to consumers, as it is reserved for use as incidental music. The only way for consumers to obtain recordings is to buy or trade the LPs provided to music directors to audition tracks. These were pressed in small numbers for audition purposes only but can and do leak into the used record market. “Misty Beethoven“ is considered the high water mark for what has come to be called "Porno Chic." Following the improbable success of "Deep Throat," adult film briefly achieved a degree of mainstream popularity. This led mainstream films to incorporate more explicit sexuality, e.g. the x-rated "Last Tango in Paris" later that year. “Caligula," a mainstream film starring Malcolm McDowell, incorporated hardcore sex footage shot after the fact and spliced in. Other notable mainstream films to receive an 'X' rating: "Midnight Cowboy," "A Clockwork Orange," and "Fritz the Cat." Porno Chic' also led adult-film producers to try to rise to meet mainstream standards. Gerard Damiano's “Devil in Miss Jones" and “The Story of Joanna" are often noted as examples. For a time, mainstream critics attended and reviewed major adult releases. Misty was screened for critics at a lavish event at The Four Seasons. While mainstream reviews of "Misty" were mixed, the film was a huge success. One theater screened “Misty" nightly for over 99 weeks. Despite Misty's wild success, the protracted shooting schedule and endless post-production took its toll on Metzger. He deliberately chose to make his next project, "Barbara Broadcast," less technically and artistically ambitious. This piece of music is “The Fuzz", composed and performed by Duncan Lamont. It is from KPM 1163: Rock Spectrum. Lamont is one of the most celebrated jazz sax players in the world. He has worked with Frank Sinatra, Paul McCartney, Count Basie, Mel Torme, Henry Mancini, and more. The Associated Board of Music uses Lamont's saxophone compositions as part of their exam process. Lamont is currently music editor for Crescendo & Jazz Magazine. Terri Hall and Jamie Gillis had great chemistry off-screen, something which comes through in their performances in the film. They also worked together in Jonas Middleton's 1976 "Through The Looking Glass.“ Jamie Gillis was sometimes referred to as the "Hebrew Hammer“. "Agincourt" refers to the Battle of Agincourt, a hard-fought English victory over a much larger French army. It is also central to Shakespeare's "Henry V," which Gillis quotes in an extended scene in the film's soft cut. In some scenes, Misty's lips do not sync well with the dialog. Reportedly, this is because much of Money's dialog was later overdubbed by a different actress. Money's relationship with the film and its director were tumultuous. Two major deleted scenes from Misty were incorporated into Metzger's subsequent films. Money's S&M scene from this film appears in "Barbara Broadcast" and her 'matador' scene appears in "Maraschino Cherry." This resulted in a lawsuit brought by the actress to obtain additional compensation for her work. Once again, this is Teorema by Italian composer Bruno Nicolai. Nicolai composed scores for many famous Italian films, including “Land Raiders" and the giallo "All the Colors of the Dark." While the Deal Historical Society was unable to provide details, it is believed the mansion was located not far from the Deal casino. Misty and Geraldine share this bathtub in a scene appearing only in the softcore version of the film. In the additional scene, Geraldine asks Misty if she is ready for Lawrence Layman. Misty replies, "As the Duke of Welligton said to Queen Victoria, and I quote: 'The motherfucker doesn't stand a chance.' " It was the first scene shot on the first day of filming. Mixing b&w footage into his vividly-colored films is a technique Metzger had used before. He filmed an extended b&w sequence in the style of a silent film for his previous release, "Naked Came The Stranger." The art/textile dealer is played by legendary gay porn star, Casey Donovan. Donovan was a veteran of the adult industry, and performed in many historic films. Again, we hear the iconic "Heat Haze", by John Cameron, one of our favorites. Cameron also composed the music for U.S. mini-series "Little House on the Prairie.“ His instrumental version of Led Zepplin's "Whole Lotta Love" was a hit for his band "Collective Consciousness Society." This art studio in Geneva is yet another set built at RKO studios by Anton Stone. Donovan starred in a very important gay film, "The Boys In The Sand. It was the first gay film to be shot in color and with a soundtrack. Donovan appeared in Metzger's prior non-adult film "Score" under his real name [John] Calvin Culver. Metzger: "Casey was an amazing performer and we had a wonderful working relationship...“ "In 1973, we were the only 2 Americans in the former Yugoslavia, for 8 weeks, on a shoot.“ Although Donvan was gay, he also appeared in a handful of straight porn films. This piece of music is "Glass Tubes," composed by Brian Bennett. It is from KPM 1162: Industry, Volume 2. While the visuals were typically edited to match the music, in this case the music was altered to match the visuals. Music Director George Craig recalls mechanically speeding up the music to better fit the pace of the scene. Over a period of years, Distribpix identified the rights-holders for each piece of music in the film. The tracks have been licensed and “Misty Beethoven" will finally receive a proper soundtrack album 36 years after its premiere. Culver's alias, "Casey Donovan," combines a character he played "Casey" (in a film of the same name) with popular musician Donovan. Culver was successful as a model, but his fame as a porn performer eventually cost him that career. He also acted on-stage in both on and off-Broadway performances. He shared the stage with Ingrid Bergman in a Broadway production of "Captain Brassbound's Conversion“ Once again, this is a portion of "Confunktion", by Dave Richmond. A respected double-bass player, Richmond has backed many great singers. He played the bass for “Your Song" and "Border Song" on Elton John's Black Album. He was also the bass guitar player on Serge Gainsbourg's legendary "Historie de Melody Nelson." Like many of his KPM contemporaries, he played for a time with British sensations "The Shadows." His bass can also be heard in the beginning and ending themes to long running British sit-com "Only Fools & Horses." The music now transitions again to "Teorema," composed by Bruno Nicolai. This hallway is part of the Deal mansion that is Geraldine's "little shack in the country." Along with the adjacent pool room, it served as the filming location for the infamous deleted scene in which Dr. Love gets rough with Misty. The scene was deleted for being grotesquely out of character for Dr. Love. Outtake footage shows one of the giant vases getting shattered during the fight. Cinematographer Paul Glickman recalls a cast member sitting nude on another giant vase. It shattered, cutting his bare posterior. No one we interviewed remembered how the homeowners responded to having two of their giant vases broken. Giving Misty a massage is Peter Andrews, who also appears in Metzger's next film, “Barbara Broadcast." "Barbara Broadcast" would be the second-to-last of Metzger's hardcore features. Metzger's final hardcore film, Maraschino Cherry, was constructed primarily from footage cut from his earlier films. Metzger would continue on to film three more non-explicit films before retiring in 1984. This scene goes on longer in the softcore version, with Geraldine noting that "I should think Jack Palance would show up for the next scene." Dr Love also quotes Shakespeare's Henry V in a naughty pun on "Once more unto the breach." The immediately subsequent scene (which appears only in the soft cut) features Lawrence Layman and Barbara watching Kojak. Barbara insists Kojak is gay: "They don't fool me with that lollipop bullshit. I know what that's supposed to mean." She also asserts that no straight NYC cop would have his suit pressed all the time. Lawrence counters this by insisting that Kojak is a California cop (as the show was filmed, though not set, in California). Susan Jensen (credited here as Constance Money) appeared in a few adult films prior to playing Misty. Her first appearance, shot while attending Mills College, was in a short stag loop. The loop is untitled but is frequently anthologized as “Panty Raid." She also appears in Zachary Strong's "Confessions of a Teenage Peanutbutter Freak." In that film, she is credited as "Christina Hoover.“ Briefly, the music again clips into "Bourbon" by Brian Bennett. Bennett, along with other 705-era KPM musicians, occasionally plays live shows as part of the "KPM All Stars.“ This track was titled “Teorema” in its first release, the soundtrack to Italian film “Geminus” It was later retitled "Thin Ice B" when released as a sublicense on Conroy's Eurobeat line. The vocals are provided by Edda Del'Orso, famous for her work on Ennio Morricone's Spaghetti Western scores. Dr. Love's blonde maid is played by adult-film actress Nancy Dare. She also appears in Metzger's genre swan-song, "Maraschino Cherry." Metzger credits cinematographer Paul Glickman with the idea to film their entrance from the RKO studio freight elevator. The tiny sign in the elevator reads "Do Not Open Doors While 'Silence' Light Is On." The elevator and studio, now called Metropolis Studios, still exist and appear remarkably unchanged. Setting a scene at a wrap party allowed the studio itself to become an impressive set. Many famous productions have made use of the studio, including "Emeril Live," "Chapelle's Show"... ..."106 & Park," "Between the Lions," and "Carmen Sandiego.“ Footage of the studio in 2012 can be seen in the "Cinetta Studios Revisited" extra. The catwalk they are on is intact and has changed little in almost 40 years. To set the studio in Italy, "Vietato Fumare" and "Silencio" signs were added. The use of cigarette smoke for humorous effect in front of the "Vietato Fumare" sign broke Metzger's longstanding ban on on-screen smoking. Ras Kean insisted on doing his own stunts, as seen here in his entrance to his party. The number of extras employed for the party scene was exceptional for an adult film. Many party-goers were friends of the cast and crew. A&P Supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, worth half a billion dollars in 1969, was among the extras filmed in this scene. Metzger deliberately avoided using footage in which Hartford was recognizable. He felt that if Hartford was visible in the film, it would become "that porn film Huntington Hartford was in.“ Hartford later became a Howard Hughes-like recluse. This piece of music is “Rebel," credited to John Moran on KPM 1135: Discotheque. This was long assumed to be the Scottish rocker John Moran of "The Johnny Hudson Hi-Four" and "The Lost Souls." Contacted by Distribpix in 2011, Moran insists that he neither composed this track nor performed on it. ASCAP's royalty payment records suggest that it was actually composed by Norman Newell, ex-head of Columbia Records. Newell was a sought-after composer and lyricist, winning a Grammy, an Emmy, a Golden Globe, 3 Ivor Novello and 6 BMI awards. Ironically, Newell famously fought to keep rock music off the Columbia label for many years. Radley found Constance through West Coast talent agent, Harold Adler. Gloria Leonard wanted to work in production, but ended up in front of the camera instead. During this scene, a mark called a "cigarette burn" or "cue mark" flashes in the upper right corner. A pair of these marks signaled to theater projectionists that it was time to switch to the next film reel. The cue marks in the film were left intact during restoration as part of the historical preservation of the film. Metzger's habit of creating unusually long reels actually presented challenges during the film scanning process. The film scanner estimates the length of film on a reel by its weight, so as to properly adjust tension on the film. The first reel of Misty Beethoven incorporated so many feet of film that the scanner declared it an error and refused to load it. Emergency calls to the scanner's creators in Sweden yielded a hastily built firmware patch to bypass the safety check. The Golden Eye III film scanner was the first of its kind in North America and one of only a handful in the world. “The Opening of Misty Beethoven" had the honor of being the first film ever transferred on a Golden Eye III in North America. The scan was done at 2K resolution-- well beyond HD levels of detail. Each transfer was over 1.5 terabytes of raw data. Color correction and dust and scratch removal was done at this resolution so the restored film could be projected theatrically. Erotic art from Asia depicts the use of strap-on dildos dating back to the 1600s. The use of a strap-on dildo by a woman to anally penetrate a man has come to be called "pegging." The term was coined by columnist Dan Savage and his readers in a 2001 online vote to name the act in "Bend Over Boyfriend." Prior to 2001, the act had no widely agreed-upon name. While Dr. Carol Queen's 1998 "Bend Over Boyfriend" videos popularized the act, it had occasionally appeared on film before. Simulated pegging was depicted in the mainstream 1970 film "Myra Breckenridge.“ Aside from a few rare loops, Misty is generally credited with being the first unsimulated depiction of pegging on film. Shaun Costello's “Midnight Desires," released later the same month, also depicted pegging but had been filmed well after Misty. It featured Metzger alum Eric Edwards getting pegged, though a "stunt ass" was used for the actual penetration shot. Likewise, Ras Kean declined to be penetrated on the set of Misty. The “art dealer," Casey Donovan, was brought in to stand-in for Kean in the penetration close-ups. At the last moment, Kean relented and agreed to be penetrated. However, Metzger insisted on using Donovan instead as he had already been brought in for that purpose. Metzger included one transgressive or controversial sex act in each of his Henry Paris films. This generated buzz and increased word-of-mouth for the films. In "The Private Afternoons of Pamela Mann," the controversial act was staged rape-play. In "Naked Came the Stranger," it was implied age-play. In "Barbara Broadcast," it was urination. And in "Maraschino Cherry," it was the S&M dungeon scene. While Glickman's protracted lighting setups sometimes frustrated the cast, the resulting shots could be spectacular. A short subject he photographed, "Angel and Big Joe," won an Academy Award in 1976. Paul Glickman is credited under an alias in Metzger's films -- either "Robert Rochester“ or "Marcel Hall." Aside from his cinematic magic, Glickman was known for his abilities as a magician. He recognized the parallels between the illusions of film and the illusions of stage magic. Metzger insists that filmmakers fall into 2 camps: those who were magicians and those who did impressions. Dr. Love calls himself "the Erotic Diaghilev," a reference to the notoriously demanding Russian ballet impresario. He also calls himself "the Svengali of Sex," a reference to the manipulative hypnotist in George du Maurier's 1894 novel "Trilby." Metzger credits cinematographer Paul Glickman with the idea of setting up this scene to play out through shadows. Glickman and Metzger worked together on all 5 of his adult "Henry Paris" films. The two sometimes clashed, as both had strong opinions and Metzger liked to frame his own shots and operate the camera himself. Metzger refers to Glickman as "a cinematographer who wanted to be a director" but admits that he was "a magician" with film. Glickman's ability to shoot steady handheld footage made his skills particularly valuable in the pre-Steadicam era. He can be see on-screen in "Naked Came the Stranger" lunging for a payphone coin-return a heartbeat too slow. These are the stairs leading to the Araceoli on Capitol Hill in Rome. An erotic boutique in Rome is named "Misty Beethoven" in unauthorized tribute to the film. Gillis is generally credited with creating the "gonzo" porn genre with "On the Prowl.“ The fictionalized depiction of "On the Prowl" in "Boogie Nights“ angered Gillis greatly. Gillis was bisexual in his personal life, though he rarely performed as such on film. A notable exception is in Gerard Damiano's "Story of Joanna.“ Gillis was active as both a performer and director in hundreds of films, from 1971- 2005. His final film role was as Stavros in non-sex film "Die You Zombie Bastards!" Mary Stuart, playing a stewardess, gives us a very memorable performance. It is Cuban cigars which are prohibited from import into the United States. The male passenger is adult performer David Williams. In an extended scene in the soft cut, the female passenger asks Dr Love if he is the Goldenrod Girl's friend and says "pretty girls get all the breaks." A typical Metzger NYC establishing shot brings us back to Dr. Love's apartment. This unidentified music is very likely a piece by Italian composer Bruno Nicolai. While this track has yet to be identified, an extremely similar but distinct piece by Nicolai is known. It is "Con Affeto" from the 1973 album "Cartoline," recorded under Nicolai's "Leo Flag“ alias. This maid is adult performer, Marlene Willoughby, who is credited under an alias. Gillis also had fond memories of working with her. He said she was "Willowy". Misty, like "My Fair Lady" is based on the George Bernard Shaw play “Pygmalion.” "Pygmalion," in turn, draws inspiration from Ovid's tale of "Pygmalion and Galatea." Pygmalion, a sculptor, falls in love with his creation: an ivory sculpture of a woman. The archetype of a creator sculpting the perfect woman only to fall in love with her himself became a staple of the Victorian stage. Shaw's play did not end with the creator and his creation becoming a couple. This angered audiences, and within a year the play was being performed with a happy ending uniting Higgins and Doolittle. Director Herbert Beerbohm Tree told Shaw, "My ending makes money, you ought to be grateful." Shaw, infuriated, replied, “Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot." The music now transitions to Allesandro Allesandroni's "Giovane Flirt." Allesandroni collaborated closely with famous Italian film score composers Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai. He managed the legendary "I Cantori Moderni" choir used in so many Spaghetti Westerns. His whistling and vocalizations were highlights of Morricone's scores for “The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,“ "A Fistful of Dollars," and more. The music transitions now to Steve Gray's "Mighty Atom," the piece which opened the film. Gray was keyboardist for John Williams' band "Sky" from 1981 until the band dispersed in 1995. Gillis was greatly enamored with Constance Money and remembered her very fondly. While they fell out of contact for decades, they spoke via phone shortly before Gillis' death. He succumbed to cancer in February of 2010 at the age of 66. Susan Jensen (as Constance Money) appeared in only a few films after "Misty Beethoven." She had leading roles in "Mary, Mary!“ and in porn-noir "Anna Obsessed." While a frequent guest at the Playboy Mansion, Hugh Hefner counseled her to attempt to cross over into mainstream film. She aggressively pursued the role of Francis Farmer in the 1982 film "Frances." She met with the film's director Graeme Clifford, but producers forbade her involvement. She did land an uncredited role as one of Dudley Moore's naughty neighbor's house-guests in "10." In the early 80s she gave birth to a son and lived platonically with adult film legend John Leslie. After her farewell film, 1984's "A Taste of Money," Leslie helped her transition out of the adult industry. From 1985 onward, she vanished entirely from the public eye. Eager to avoid the hurtful treatment she received from friends and neighbors for being a 'porn star' she lives in relative anonymity on the U.S. Pacific Coast. Contacted by Distribpix in in 2011, she offered enthusiastic support and copious information, though she declined to appear on-camera. Despite some challenging health issues, she is currently hard at work writing her memoirs. The actress who played Geraldine, now living in California, was also located but declined to participate in the release. Gloria Leonard (who appeared in the film as Barbara Layman) is now retired in Hawaii. Long an industry icon, she generously provided commentary for the soft cut and a lengthy on-camera interview. Despite extensive efforts, Ras Kean's real name and whereabouts remain unknown. Calvin Culver (credited as Casey Donovan for his role as the Art Dealer) went on to star in many more films. His work as a gay porn star and high-priced prostitute cost him his lucrative modeling career. He wrote an advice column, "Ask Casey" for Stallion Magazine for many years. He also managed a Bed & Breakfast, "Casa Donovan" in Key West, Florida. Culver died of AIDS-related pulmonary infection in 1987. The film's music director, George Craig, provided library music and commissioned scores for hundreds of films and shows. He is now retired, but we had the privilege of interviewing him on-camera for this release. Paul Glickman served as cinematographer on many more films, most of them mainstream. His short animated film, "The Calypso Singer," is still widely viewed and loved. Glickman's latest film collaboration, "El Salon México" appeared in many film festivals in 2011. Radley Metzger directed three more mainstream films before retiring. They were "The Cat and the Canary" (1978), "The Tale of Tiffany Lust" (1981), and "The Princess and the Call Girl" (1984). While retired in New York, Metzger continues to actively collaborate in the release of his films. His memories of filming Misty are available as a commentary track for the hardcore cut of the film. In a final bizarre note, in this scene, Gillis is reading a manual on enemas. Gillis would go on to play Burt, the Enema Bandit, in the following year's "Water Power."
