TEMPTATION OF THE MASK "My name is Takashi Kita. "Around 10 p.m. in Showa 62 (1987)... "I walked past Kenzo Ishizawds house, 1-23 Seijo, Setagaya, Tokyo. "Suddenly, I got a strange feeling about the place and stopped. "The reason the house looked strange to me was because it was white. "When I checked the vicinity, there was no one around. "At that time, I noticed that there was a trash bag. "I got a match out of my pocket and lit it up. "When the whole bag had caught fire... "I threw it towards the wall of Ishizawds house." I think there's nothing much you can do. I'm not sure if you can make the boy talk. Is Satoshi okay? He went outwith his ex-wife. Divorced, right? Well, his step-child anyway. Apparently, you came to Tokyo from Okayama... and have been staying at your older sister's house. Was your brother-in-law okay with that? Usually, people want to avoid living with a brother-in-law of your age. Okay, let's slow down a bit. Whose hobby is this? My younger brother likes this. I think he bought it somewhere, Kawasaki maybe. Does Takashi like Egon Schiele? You know him? Yes, I took some art classes as a student. I know nothing about this kind of stuff. But maybe he does because his character has a bit of a hysterical side. Follow me please. Honey, somebody is here asking about Takashi. Nice to meet you. I am Yuuki. Are you an archer? I was the captain of my university team. These days, I have to train my body in order to run my business. Sorry for the interruption. I would like to know your impression of Takashi. He is a good boy. Do you know anything related to his arson? - What do you mean? - I am talking about his motivation. Perhaps frustration? He might have peeped at our bedroom window. Stop it please! He'd never... Still far to go. Though this looks mature enough. I get it. There are some people who can't live on a Katsudon. What a man. He is exactly like a marmot. When you're in a small and square place, you become like that. This is the pistol that was fired at your sister right before you were arrested. Why did you shoot? Where did you get it? Whose is this? Hey! Hey, Kita! Kita! Get it together! Kita! Kita! Kita! Get it together! Kita! Kita! Get it together! I've never seen him have a panic attack like that. Really? Are you overwhelmed by my brother to the extent that he would bite you? This is not a joke! Sorry. I'm also very frustrated by this recent development in my life. I understand. Let's talk again later. Russian Roulette. You know about it? Yes. Do you want to do it? What I will bet is my confession. I can't allow it. This is not an amusement park. Then let's make it into an amusement park. A bullet... I don't have the authority for that. I'm not talking about that. Do you want to listen to my story? Or don't you want to? That's all there is to it. Let me go! After father died, there was nowhere to go. I don't think he will trouble you, since he's a good boy. Fine by me. We have a lot of empty rooms anyway. Which high school are you going to transfer to? Probably Matsuzono High. Takashi, he doesn't like mumblers. So avoid that kind of behavior, please. Isn't it a good thing since you can stay home? I don't want to. Your sister really loves going to the Culture Center. She does leathercraft at the moment. What you had weren't E.P. hormones. It looks like the sleeping pills Saki took sometimes. Brother-in-law... Call me Masaaki. What? What did you do to me? Your sleeping body was beautiful. Listen. Before we have sex again, use this and clean yourself. Got it? I won't do any such a thing... And... We'll train your body and make it stronger through archery. I'll teach you later. Brother-in-law, I'd like to eat a bowl of noodles. Before that, think about what you are wearing! I don't want to! This's real I brought from overseas through my private secretary. If you don't listen to me... I'll use it on you! Hey, stop right there! Wait! Wait! Takashi! What on earth did you do? Answer me! Give it to me! Happy Birthday to Satoshi. There's just one thing that doesn't add up in your story. Why was there a bullet in the gun? Kawasaki beat you up and pulled the trigger, because it was empty. However, when you fired at your sister, it had a bullet. Please tell me. About yourself. Kawasaki didn't like it. So it was thrown away? No, stored somewhere. After our divorce's finalised and Kawasaki moves somewhere else... I'll put it back up. You like that picture? It makes me feel like I'm with Takashi. A self-portrait. Follow me, please. No, today I just wanted to check your room. When you came out to see me downstairs, I felt something was off. I didn't know what it was. Your makeup's changed, right? Really? Changed how? - Perhaps more intense? - I see. Anyway, regarding the pistol Takashi fired ... Where was it? Where? I don't know. This's your room, isn't it? It's not like I know everything about my room. Also, this room was like Takashi's for a while. Do you have feelings for Takashi? Your have similar gestures. He often does this. Sometimes your face looks similar to Kawasaki's... when he was in love with him. Did you know? I was his wife. I can charge Kawasaki for possession of a gun. Still, I wanted to hear it from you... Who loaded Kawasaki's gun? What are you doing? You scared? Takashi and I experienced this fear many times in the interrogation room. I'll tell you, since you're in love with him. - It was me. - What? I loaded the gun. When he had nowhere to go, I let him live with me without hesitating. I got an idea in my head that I could make this house mine. This house belongs to you and Kawasaki, doesn't it? Do you think so? I'm not going to forgive him. Never! When I realized he was bi, I hated him. I, no... Women don't satisfy him. So I thought he'd definitely fall for Takashi. You're lying. That's not possible. You think so? But I also love my brother very much. Who would've expected him to commit arson? Let him stay there for a while. If you release him now, the white house I got after all this will be burnt down. I'll repaint it, sooner or later. Maybe you can't believe this, but that's what your sister said. You knew who all the faces behind the mask were, didn't you? Why'd you keep lighting white houses on fire? You're not going to tell me anything. If you tell me the truth... I'll help you to get your sentence reduced. We'll take advantage of the Juvenile Offender Law. And if all goes well, would you like to live with me? I need you. It seems your sister likes the color white. Is it connected to why you burn white houses, Takashi? Takashi! Stop it! Taskahi! Stop it! Takashi! Satoshi... Satoshi!
