I been waiting all morning. Now how much longer? I told you, son. They'’re still working on the boiler. [Sighs] Probably be ready any time now. Be ready any time. You said that three hours ago. Bet even the flies crawl around here. Beats me. [Laughs] [Clears throat] Uh, excuse me, ma'’am. May I sit? If you like. Why, thank you. Ah. Uh, where you bound? Sacramento. Not San Francisco? No. But I gather that'’s where everybody else is going. Oh. Oh, you bet. The best poker players in the country'’ll be gathered there. They'’ll be coming from all over-- New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Orleans. You mean they'’re going that far just to play poker? It'’s to prove who's the best. Oh. Yeah. You'’re a poker player. I'’m a gambler. You'’re very young. Yeah, well, I haven'’t made my full dent yet. In San Francisco I will. Ah, San Francisco. It'’s quite a town. I'’d be glad to show you around. Uh, sorry. Uh, what'’s in Sacramento? My husband. Oh. Uh, well, uh, ma'’am, it'’s been real nice. Thank you. Good luck to you. Oh, good luck to you too. [Clears throat] Uh, you fellas mind if I sit in? Take a chair. Thank you. What'’s the game? Dealer'’s choice. Five-card stud. I'’d like someone to look after my horse. You takin'’ the train? Yep. When'’ll you be back for the horse? If i'’m not back in a week, sell it. Ooh, ace. Well, I believe I have to go for $50. Not for me. Huh? [Laughs] You got the makin'’s of a good poker player, boy. But you'’d better be careful. '’cause whatever you're doing, you'’re doing too good. Ante up. All righty. Here we go. Ooh. Five. [Man] $20. See your 20. I raise you another 20. 20. Ten bets...Five. Call. [Sighs] Well... [Laughs] Gentlemen, this little ol'’ ace is gonna cost you, uh... $50. Where you from, boy? Ah, around. What'’s your name? Billy Montana. Who taught you to cheat like that, Billy Montana? That'’s a mighty harsh thing to say, mister. That kid'’s cheating. Seems he'’s not the only one cheating in this game. Why Don'’t you two take your game somewhere else? Imagine them accusing me of cheating. Oh, you were cheating. You'’re just better at it than they are. Hey, now wait a minute. I'’ll give you this, though. Damn few deal seconds any better than you do. If you Don'’t think I can win without cheating, you just try me, mister. With you dealing? No, thank you. All right. We'’ll use an impartial dealer. Ma'’am? You know how to handle a deck of cards? Well, I might. How much money you got? About $300. This won'’t take long. Cut. What'’s your game? Five-card stud. Nine bets $20. See your $20. Seven of spades. Eight of spades. Eight of spades bets. And i'’ll see your 20. $75. Hmm. Don'’t scare me any. New game. Call. Pair of eight bets. $100. I Don'’t have that much. How much do you have? Uh... [Clears throat] $68. Pair of eights bets $68. Three eights. Poker'’s a trade, son. And an honest one. It'’s fellas like you that give gambling a bad name. Like drunks give drinkin'’. Consider yourself lucky. If you were dirty dealing on the Mississippi, you'’d be at the bottom of the river by now. Oh, yeah. Never leave a man busted. Didn'’t take as long as I thought it would. When are we getting out of here? That train has been sitting there, panting like a big bull for hours. We'’re leavin' now, boy. Who the hell is that? Mr. Stobridge. He owns this railroad. He'’s the reason we been waiting? Like I said, Mr. Stobridge owns the railroad. Goin'’ now, folks. All aboard. All aboard. Champagne, caviar, and beautiful women. It'’s gonna be a hell of a party. Nice to have you with US, Mr. Hawkes. Ma'’am. Brady hawkes. Well, thank you, Lily. Where you from? Everywhere. Where you from, doc? Wherever they play cards, honey. Get me the name of that redhead in the green dress back there. Yes, sir. And what was that all about, Mr. Stobridge. [Laughs] Nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about. Just checking on the passengers. [Boy] "Dear pa, I know you Don'’t know me, "but my name'’s Jeremiah, and i'’m your son. "I didn'’t know who my father was till a while back, "but my mom said you didn'’t even know there was a me. "I didn'’t wanna bother you none, "but now I got no other way. "So i'’m writing to let you know the fix we'’re in, mom and me. And we need your help." Here, kid. Let me go! Hey, come back here! [Horses whinnying] Whoa, boy. Let him go. Come here, boy. Come here. I heard you sent off a letter. Hmm. Fellow down at the post office says it went to somewhere in Kansas. Who'’s in Kansas? Who, boy? Brady hawkes. There'’s no law against writing your own father. Yeah, so she told ya? I kept askin'’. What'’d you tell him in the letter? Nothin'’. Told him where to find ya? Told him about me. Huh. You tell me now what you wrote down in that letter. Let him be. You put him up to this? What? He wrote hawkes a letter. I wanna know what he said. Well, that'’s Jeremiah's business. Not if it brings hawkes here, lookin'’. And you'’ll beat it out of him, won'’t you? If I have to. You get out of the way. You talk to me, boy. No! Run, Jeremiah! Run! Let go, Eliza! Let go! Go! Ugh! [Woman screams] Jeremiah. Are you all right? I hid out down by the creek till it got dark. Rufe, did he hurt you? Hurt me? No. Jeremiah. What did you write in that letter? I told him that we needed his help. He'’s coming. I know he is. You have to leave, Jeremiah. I Don'’t know what rufe will do. Then we'’ll both go. I can'’t. Why? If rufe thought I was going to meet Brady hawkes... I can do US more good stayin'’ here. There'’s a town called Santa Ria. East of here. Here. Take that. I want you to take the stage tonight. You go to Mrs. Carlson'’s rooming house. You tell her who you are. She'’ll remember me. But what about my father? If he'’s coming, he has to come through there. You watch every train that comes in and every man that gets off it. He'’s a big man, Jeremiah. Handsome. He wears a beard. He hurt his leg during the war. I heard he uses a cane now. You'’ll know him right off. - Then we'’ll be comin' for you? - No. You tell him not to come. '’cause it'll only get him killed. Tell him to take you with him wherever he'’s going. And you tell him i'’ll find you. Understand? Yes'’m. Brady hawkes. Going up and down the Mississippi and all the way to San Francisco. I sure hope you give me another chance to play once we get there. I'’m not going to San Francisco. Well, where you going? Now, that'’s none of your business. You stung me pretty hard back there, Mr. Hawkes. If I hadn'’t come along when I did, you'’d be in one hell of a fix right now. But one thing for sure, you'’ll have to play your poker straight from now on. They'’ll be playin' for big money in San Francisco, and I needed a stake. So i--i bent the rules a little. Bent the rules a little? Better word'’s "cheated." I can play well, Mr. Hawkes, without cheating. And I intend to be the best. Where you from, kid? What difference does that make? Where? The badlands. Farmer. Ah, maybe. Farm boy. Headed for the lights. Anxious to play your hand in the big city. Better off farmin'’. Mm-mm. That sort of life is short and full of blisters. Gamblin'’. That'’s a way to travel and see things. I'’ve gambled a lot of towns. I'’ve read a lot of faces. Gambling can take hold of a man. You gotta be able to walk away from it. I done pretty good so far. I been around. But not long enough to see what i'’ve seen. Kid, i'’ve seen cowboys gamble their saddles, loggers, their winter'’s wages. I'’ve seen men put up the deeds to their homes and their businesses and their futures. I'’ve seen those same men blow their brains out after losing everything they own. And heaven on earth is a Mississippi river boat. You sure got the fever, Don'’t you, kid? Yeah. Any gambler caught cheatin'’ better be ready to forfeit his hide. Thanks for the advice. Still, I hope someday we play. Wouldn'’t mind taking you down a few notches. Lot of men have tried. [Train whistle blows] Here, here. Oh, beautiful. Say that woman'’s name was Reed, John? Yes, Mr. Stobridge. Jennifer Reed. Mrs. Jennifer Reed. Mrs.? Tell her i'’d like her to join US. Yes, sir. May I propose a toast, ladies and gentlemen? Here'’s to good luck in San Francisco. San Francisco. Excuse me, ma'’am. Mr. Stobridge would like you to join his party. I Don'’t know Mr. Stobridge. Seems he knows you, miss. Mrs. Tell Mr. Stobridge thank you. I'’m not interested. I'’m afraid he insists. I have a husband. I Don'’t think he'd approve. When Mr. Stobridge wants something, he usually gets it. If I were you, i'’d do as he asks. I told you. I'’m a married woman. My husband is a very influential man. Make it easy on yourself. I Don'’t think she wants to go to your party. I'’d stay out of it, mister. Mr. Stobridge runs this train. In fact, the whole railroad. Let'’s go. [Gasps] Oh! Give me the gun! I'’m gonna get your head, kid! I Don'’t think the lady wants to go to your party. [Sighs] Thank you. You didn'’t want to go to the party, did you? [Sighs] How are ya feeling? [Door closes] I'’m okay. I'’m sorry. I said i-- and I didn'’t mean to-- I know you'’re sorry. Yeah. It just is temporary, you know? Some times you kinda... It gets away from ya, and i-- [Chuckles] So pretty. What if Brady does come? What-- never counted on that, did we? Yeah, I think-- I think we'’ve built up too much here. Just to let him come, and take it, and... You know, and i-- i'’d want to... Stay awake every night looking over my shoulder, till he shows. You can understand that, can'’t you? Yeah. Yeah? Where'’s the boy? I'’m not saying! You can beat me into next week, i'’m not telling you. Why? Because you'’d hurt him. Oh... I'’m gonna send men out... To track Jeremiah down. Bring him back here. Rufe? If you hurt him... You'’ll have Brady hawkes down your throat for sure! And me too. I'’ll come after you. I swear I will. [Chattering in Spanish] Oh! Um, excuse me, mister. Do you know where Mrs. Carlson'’s rooming house is? I Don'’t know, boy. I think it'’s somewhere up '’ere outside the gate. [Conductor] There'’ll be a layover here, folks. About an hour. While we take on some water. [Bells clanging] I'’d all stay on board, if I were you. You'’re not gettin'’ off, are ya? I thought i'’d just take a little walk around the platform. This is a town I think you could afford to miss. Well, I can'’t afford to pass it up. [Chuckles] There'’s a saloon with a poker sign out there. Have to give it a try. I wouldn'’t do that. Why? What kind of people would be in a town like this? Just dirt scratchers, and sheep herders, right? And what else could they do? Just wait for a fella like you to get off the train. Ahh! Wish me luck.

Couple of times. But he'’d find her, or she'’d go back. What is it, boy? You seem kind of skittish about me. Up till a couple of days ago, I thought it was you who ran out on me. Did she tell you that? No. She said it was her who ran out on you. Didn'’t even know who my father was till a while back. And why, after all this time, did she finally tell you about me? Because of rufe. I-I guess she thought if I ever needed anybody-- I know mom ran out on you, but why didn'’t you try and find US? Didn'’t you ever wonder what I was like? Didn'’t you want to see me? Jeremiah, I didn'’t even know I had a sun until I got your letter, and i'’m here. You mean, mom never told you about me? That'’s right. Why? I figure she had her reasons. Where is your mother now? You fixin'’ to see her? Yup. She'’s still in yuma. But she doesn'’t want you to go there. Why? Because rufe near runs the town. He'’s got lots of men working for him. Wearin'’ guns? Yes, sir.

But we'’re good. Well, why Don'’t you just name a price? Thank you. When am I going to get to yuma? Tomorrow. And you, go to sleep. Okay. According to the kid, they'’ll know you're on this train. That means Bennett and his men will be waiting for you. It'’s about the way I figure it, too. Well, you'’re going to be good and outnumbered. That derringer'’s not going to do it. You pull that trigger twice, that little old gun'’s going to be emptier than a banker'’s heart. [Scoffs] There'’s only so many times you can get away running that same bluff. All of a sudden, you'’re the old wisdom-bringer. Well, it'’s steep odds. Unless you want to jump in and change '’em. What do you think I am? Loco? [Train whistling] Think he'’s asleep. Would you like to sit down? He'’s quite a boy. All like his mother. Bet she was beautiful. The way I remember. You didn'’t even know you had a son? I was in a high-stakes poker game in Kansas, and I got this letter. [Sighs] Rode out the very same day. What are you going to do when you get there? I Don'’t know. I just know she'’s in trouble. Why, she must be something quite special. Mrs. Reed. You'’ve been riding this car for a long time now. It'’s awfully drafty. Dusty. Must be quite uncomfortable. Well, since you own the railroad, Mr. Stobridge, why Don'’t you do something about it? I intend to. I am extending to you my personal invitation to join me in my car. You can freshen up, join me and my friends for dinner, have some drinks-- i'’m sure you'll find the ride much more comfortable. Thank you, Mr. Stobridge. I'’m doing just fine. I insist. So do I. [Clears throat] Perhaps you Don'’t remember me. We met in Sacramento? We never met. I even remember where it was. Just leave me alone, Mr. Stobridge! I still insist. Mr. Stobridge, the lady'’s with me. And i'’m with them. [Sighs] [Laughing] Hawkes, you do have a habit of involving yourself in other peoples'’ affairs. But since you'’re a poker player, maybe there'’s a way to resolve this situation. You already have $1,000 of my money. Least you could do is to give me a chance to get even. Poker game? Poker game. But not for money! For the lady. No. Not for the lady. What have you got against playing for money, Mr. Stobridge? Who'’s this? Name is Billy Montana. I know, I know. You never heard of me. But you will. Well, Mr. Montana, i'’ve played poker all over the world. I'’ve played for lots of different stakes. I find playing for a beautiful woman, rather an intriguing stake. I'’m not going to be a stake in a damn poker game. Besides, Mr. Stobridge, the lady'’s already with US. Win or lose, what do we stand to gain? Except money! I say every man sits down for $5,000. You, Brady, doc, Palmer and myself. All right. My 5,000 against the lady. No. Not against the lady. [Chuckles] Mr. Hawkes, if you'’re concerned about the lady'’s... virtue... - Believe me-- - hey, you got your game. Fine! Fine. Fifteen minutes. My car. What the hell are you doing? You realize how much money is floating around up there? Thousands! Maybe even a million! And you been around that kind of money, but I haven'’t. [Sighs] Brady, we could walk out of there rich men! Where are you gonna get $5,000? You. From me? Wait! Brady! No. Uh-uh. You need a friendly face in there. They'’re in there layin'’ for you. Could get noisier than a Mexican revolution, you know? Uh, you do have $10,000, Don'’t ya? [Chuckles] Kid, i'’ll tell you what. If you Don'’t make it as a gambler, you'’ll do real good spreading fertilizer. Come on, let'’s go! Billy, wait for me up here. I need to talk to the lady. All right. I'’m sorry. For what? For gettin'’ you into this. I'’m a gambler. Might be missing something. Might have a good time. Parties like that bring back... old times for me. Those women with him? They'’re being paid to be there. Chippies. Whores. Whatever you want to call them. I was one once. It was because I had no choice. Now I do. Two years ago, I got married. To a man named John Reed. He was a hell rat like a thousand others. Diggin'’ for gold. But he struck it rich. Real rich. And he married the prettiest whore in town. [Snorts] Suddenly, there we were. Mixing with the rich. The cream of Sacramento society. Even though he needed it worse than me, John thought that I ought to take a little Polish. Learn to dress and talk like a lady. So he sent me off to a St. Louis finishing school. Two years. I learned everything it takes to make a whore into a lady. It wasn'’t easy. I am going back a lady. Yeah. You are. [Sighs] I guess the closer I get to Sacramento, men like stobridge will pop up. Once I get off this train, it'’s all gonna change. How do you mean? Back to the way it was. To most people in Sacramento... I'’ll still just be a whore. The hell with them. I like what I see. [Train whistles] [Knocking] That'’ll be our guests. [Door opens] Nice to see ya again. Oh. Right on time! You gentlemen know each other? Or of each other? We'’ve met before. Last time was in Chicago. The king'’s hotel. Big poker doin'’s, as I remember. But i'’ve never had the pleasure of playing against Mr. Hawkes. - Welcome. - Thank you. - And this is, um... - Montana. Billy Montana. Oh yeah. Billy Montana. Take a seat. Yeah. Now, gentlemen. May I introduce Mr. Horace crown? He'’s gonna be our dealer. Gentlemen. Here, now. What do you think you'’re doing? [Clears throat] It'’s called "reading the room," Mr. Stobridge. [Sneering laughter] The game is five-card stud. Table stakes. If that'’s all right with you, gentlemen. Lilly? New deck, gentlemen? Second deck, gentlemen. Jack of hearts. Three of hearts. Four under to you, Mr. Montana. You still checking out the room, kid, or are you in? [Sighs] I fold. Ace-queen bets 200. Make it five. [Dealer] Your 300 and... 300 more. Kings win it. Kings. Pay up, John. Kings and tens. Read '’em and weep, gentlemen. [Laughs] Read '’em and weep. I have a feeling you'’re going to be just like your father. He'’s the best. You Don'’t like him much, do you? Haven'’t known him long. But my mom told me all about him. Does she still love him? The way she talks about him... Think she does. She should have never left him. Well, people Don'’t always do what'’s best for them. Do you like my father? What kind of a question is that? I am married. Do you love your husband? Will you just deal? [Whistle blows, bell clangs] That must be the kid. What about hawkes? I Don'’t know. But if the kid'’s around, he can'’t be far enough. Sit down. [Steam chuffing, bell clanging] I'’ll see your 200. Not 200, friend. Two thousand. [Sighs] Too steep. I fold. [Knocking] Look at that... Deuce of spades... Pair of fours. Three of diamonds. Fours bet. One-fifty? I'’ll raise you 200. Queen high. Possible straight. Queen checks. I bet it all. Fifteen hundred. Call. Well, I may not have my straight... But I got myself a king. Pair of fours. How'’d you know? You just paid to see the cards, boy. Lessons come extra. Yeah. If you Don'’t mind, i'’d kinda like to stick around and watch. Cards kinda funny. I'’ll leave the game to you, gentlemen. You know, Doug? It'’s you and me now. Ante up. Ace of diamonds... Ten of hearts. Ace bets. Ace bets 500. Pair of aces. Seven of hearts. Pair of aces bet. Pair of aces bets a thousand. [Knocks on table] Five of clubs. Nine of hearts. Possible flush. Pair of aces still bet. Pair of aces bets 2500. Let'’s make it 5,000. Hmm. You know, even if you got one i'’m afraid you've got in the hole, you still got to catch another one to make it work. And i'’m also afraid the odds... Are against you. That'’s why they call it gambling. [Chuckles] Twenty-five. [Knocks table] Three aces. Jack of hearts. Possible flush. Possible straight flush. Three aces bet. Three aces bets 2500. Why Don'’t I just save US some time? [Chips clicking] Winner takes all. [Laughs] He'’s tryin' to buy it! [Chuckles] I Don'’t think so. [Stobridge] How do you know? Instinct. Sometimes, that'’s all you have to go on. Palmer, do you realize what the odds are? He knows what the odds are. Play it through. That'’s a fool bet, Mr. Stobridge. I am acting, Mr. Palmer. It'’s my money. Nope. It'’s my money. [Gasps] Oh, yeah! - Take it, hawkes. - Thanks, Doug. My pleasure. You'’re not leaving, hawkes. - We keep playing. - That wasn'’t the deal. We keep playing! For how long, Mr. Stobridge? Until you finally win? No, thank you. George? The man won fair, Mr. Stobridge. Let it go. He deserves the utmost courtesy. It goes with winning. Hawkes, another time. Maybe San Francisco. - Thanks, Doug. - Lilly? You get him the cash. [Giggles] [Soft talking] Who won? We did it. Oh, that'’s wonderful, Brady. Billy'’s collecting the money, right now. Hawkes. Stay still. I guess you know why we'’re here. Rufe Bennett. That'’s right. Seems you'’re making Mr. Bennett a very nervous man. Take him on out. - You okay? - [Gasps] Yeah. Thomas? Drinks are on the house, drinks are on me for everybody! Sarah! Come on, honey, you go. Oh, what are we celebrating? Well, you might call it a wake. Anybody we know? [Laughs] Eliza! Come in, come in! Have a drink. I'’m afraid I have some bad news for you, rufe. Well, speak up! These people here are my friends. Brady'’s still alive. [Chuckles] What are you talking about? Rose and winters have both been shot. And the half-breed'’s somewhere between here and Benton. But nice try, rufe. Get these people out of here. Get '’em out! Right now! No way around it, rufe. You'’re going to have to face him on your own. Maybe. You'’re still afraid of him, aren'’t you? I can beat him. You remember the last time you said that? Biggest showdown poker game in the history of the territory. He won that hand by bluffin'’. I should have won. I had the hand. But he beat you. - He won'’t again. - Then why are you afraid to face him now? It'’s the chance you'’ve been waiting for. Are you afraid because you'’ve never beaten him at anything? I took his woman. Ain'’t that right? It'’s not so much that you love me, rufe, is it? It'’s that you hate him. I guess a little of both. [Bell clanging] [Conductor] Yuma! Yuma station, folks! You know I can help! Jeremiah, if you really want to help, you'’ll go to Sacramento with Jenny. I'’ll be along as soon as I can. I'’ll take good care of him. Brady? Some days you'’re like, playin'’ a cold deck. A good gambler never cheats, but he doesn'’t go against the odds, either. That'’s good advice. Yeah. Just Don'’t feel that I have much choice this time. I'’d stick around to drive the hearse... San Francisco'’s waitin'. Well, you'’re making good sense for a change. Good luck. You too, kid. [Chattering] I Don'’t want to go to Sacramento. I'’m worried about my dad. Me too. Let'’s go. He'’s comin'. ♪ Oh, wish I was in Dixie away, hooray ♪ ♪ in dixieland i'’ll take my stand-- ♪ Cowboy, we'’re closed. Oh!

Gun belts out on the table. - [Cocks hammer] - That means you too, pardner. That'’s right. You. Out from behind there. Come on, all of you. Outside. Come on! Hey, come on. Get up! [Gun lands upstairs] Go on. Join your friends. [Coughs] [Bullets hit floor] Who are ya? That leaves you two. Now the odds are even. Read the room for you. Been a long time, Brady. Not a long time. You know, this is not your fight. Yeah, it is. You still carry that derringer? As I recall, you never... You never liked to use it. No! We wait here! [Groans] Stop! Please! Hey! I hope you try it. You'’re running out of breath, Brady. That derringer-- it'’s empty. - Are you sure? - I heard both shots and I saw the holes. - I reloaded. - You didn'’t have time. You bluffed me a long time ago, but not now. - Not again. - You call me. You callin'’ me, rufe? Rufe. [Clicks] You lose again. You coming with US? Not now. What are we gonna do about Jeremiah? He needs to be with you for a while. You ought to get to know him. You'’ll be okay? Yeah. Good-bye, Eliza. Good-bye. Jeez, that was something! Where to now? I Don'’t know, kid. San Francisco, huh? Come on! You and me make a good team! I got a son to think about now. Well, what'’s wrong with San Francisco? Ocean air will do him so good. Matter of fact, it'’ll do US both some good. I Don'’t want to raise my son around saloons. Send him to a nice school. Besides, poker'’s all you know. What else is a gambler with a gimpy leg gonna do? [Laughing] [Sighs] Oh, that was a hell of a bluff you ran back there! I wouldn'’t have bought it. You didn'’t have time to reload. I mean, I heard the front barrel. It was empty. There wasn'’t time to load the second one, either, was there? Was there? Let'’s just say I ran half a bluff.
