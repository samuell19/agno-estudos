Our world is on the brink of a sexual and technological revolution. [man] I believe that humans will want to marry robots by about the year 2050. For thousands of men, sex with female robots, or fembots, is their ultimate fantasy. [man] If I'm attracted to a woman, it's very likely that I am going to imagine her as a fembot. You're kidding me! The fantasy of having something beautiful you can control, that's not gonna leave because it thinks you're a freak, it's not going to leave because it found somebody better. We meet the two inventors competing to create the world's first sex robot. This is a human action. It has a pelvic type of thrust. That's what it's about right there. We're the future. You cannot catch a disease from her. She cannot say no to you. She's always willing to please you. And we meet the man who isn't prepared to wait for technology to enable his fantasy and wants to turn his girlfriend into a robot right now. Activate robot mode. Obedience is pleasure. Pleasure is obedience. [robotic voice] Unit Meg responding. Unit Meg is a robot designed for male enjoyment. All over America, there are thousands of men with an unlikely obsession. [Meg] Scanning, scanning, scanning. They dream of love and sex with a female robot, and for some, phone sex lines are the closest thing available. [man] I would like you now to start undressing. [fembot] Unit complies, master. A robot fetish is the ability to control and that sort of master-slave or a dominant-submissive dynamic. [man] Now I'd like you to open up your chest panel and remove the cover. [fembot] Unit complies. Chest panel open, master. The robot fetish scene covers every part of America. It's a secretive, Internet-driven world where members go by their cybernames. [woman] I would say a man who mainly interacts with a robot is not being challenged in the way that a human-to-human relationship challenges us. It's not the norm. [fembot] I am not a person, I am an electronic device. Delosian is a video games tester. He first became aware of his interest in female robots when he was a child. I just thought it was really cool, in the mid- to late-'70s, when you had TV shows like "The Six Million Dollar Man" and "The Bionic Woman." And when you're younger, it's like, "That would be cool," but as you get older, you're just like, "Hmmm," you know, "can I do things to it?" My perfect robot companion would be 5'5" tall, nice figure, hour-glass figure. But when we get into what her face looked like, what her hair looked like, those would be interchangeable. The idea that you can remove, like, a limb. You know, you can hit a button and the arm comes off or you peel the face off and there's circuitry, and, you know, everything underneath. It's just intriguing that something can look so human without being human at all. But Delosian doesn't just want a fembot for sex, he also believes that it could be the ideal romantic partner. I would have it programmed like a companion, to know what I like, to know what I don't like. It's the whole idea of man taking charge. It's almost as close to human slavery as you can get. And I'm not saying that that's a good thing, but I'm saying that there is a slight attraction to one person being in charge of another human-looking entity. Delosian's single at the moment, but he still bears the scars of a painful break-up. For him, robots offer a less emotionally risky option. I just got out of this relationship. I didn't really get out, I was kinda forced out. It just kinda dissipated, you know. The girl that I was with, I really had strong, strong feelings for, and, you know, so right now my heart is broken. I feel like I don't want to do anything anymore. You know, it's, I don't... Like I said, I wouldn't wish this on anybody. One of the things I think is more preferable about having a robot companion as opposed to a human female is the fact that robots don't break your heart, basically. They don't leave. They don't have emotional issues. They don't leave you because you don't have enough money or you don't drive the right car. He lives on the edge of the desert, a place of solitude where he can recover from his broken relationship. Now you know, I need to sort out my emotions, and I would rather do that with a robot who could just sit there and go, "I understand," even if they don't because they're not really programmed to. It's better than spending a hundred dollars an hour for a shrink, you know. And obviously robot companions have not been created yet. So right now, I don't want to say it's unfortunate, but the only real option is to be in a relationship with a real woman. For some, Delosian's desire for robot companionship has worrying implications. I think that a robot fetish can encourage a man to have an unhealthy relationship toward women. Ideally, a relationship is about human growth and to learn from the interaction and to perhaps heal old wounds. I don't think there is that possibility that easily with a robot, as the robot is not going to give you the feedback that a human being can in terms of being able to listen and talk back in a thoughtful, heartfelt way. But some academics are not so negative about the prospect of human-robot relationships. [man] There are millions and millions of people in the world who are unhappy because they're lonely. I think for such people, sex robots will be a real boon. It'll fill a huge void in their lives, and for many, it will make them much happier people, and therefore I think sex robots will be very good for society. In a small industrial building on the outskirts of Dallas, one man is working on making Delosian's dream a reality. His name -- Doug Hines. And he's making Roxi, which he hopes to be the world's first sex robot. Let me show you. This is Roxi. This is Roxi's face, which is our model face, and as you can see, the beauty that she has I think is quite striking. Obviously, she's sitting on a desk right now and sorry about that, Roxi, that you're kinda detached from your head. This is Roxi 2. Doug says he's been working on Roxi for seven years. It may look crude, but he's got ambitious plans for his sex robot. Now you'll notice that she has multiple points of movement. She's going to have eyebrows, the eyes, the eyelids. She's going to be able to smile. She even has a special face when she has her moment of ecstasy, if you know what I mean. Her pelvic area thrusts when she's being intimate. We also have a very large tongue which I'll show you in a moment, that's very erotic. This is the future. This is so cool. I'm an engineer, a technical, analytical guy, and what I did is I said, what other markets are out there that really there's a gap between what's available now and what's possible? And the adult industry is one where there hasn't been much innovation in a very long time. And we saw that products that are on the market right now didn't really offer that caring, that loving. They don't talk. They don't interact. They don't feel your touch. They don't move. They don't provide that connection. And so that's a beautiful thing to let people express how they feel in a healthy way. Doug is planning to unveil Roxi to the world in Las Vegas at the largest adult trade show in North America. And this is music to the ears of robot enthusiasts. [man] I think Doug is a pioneer insomuch as he kind of started the revolution of a robot that can have sex. It's one of those things where you look at it and you're just like, "Someday," you know... What was it, Cinderella or Snow White singing about someday her prince will come? Well, someday, my android's gonna come, dammit. For some, robots offer sex without emotional attachment. For others, fembots can offer a sense of protection. Keizo has been obsessed with fembots since he was a kid. He grew up in this tough neighborhood where being part Japanese, part Hispanic made him a target. I was bullied severely as a child. Part of it has to do with my being mixed heritage. I've been assaulted. I've been stabbed, I've been beaten and pummeled, and, uh, all for nothing. So robots became an escape. Even in that sense, thinking of having a fembot that is practically indestructible can even be part of the fantasy. Here you have a partner that can fight alongside you. When Keizo hit puberty, his interest in robots became a full-blown fetish. I was facing so much rejection in my youth that my confidence also fell by the wayside, and women pick up on that. Of course seeing things like mannequins in a department store, I felt drawn to that because there they were, beautiful, statuesque, and... a lack of response was better than a negative response. Keizo is an artist. Despite a string of relationships, he's never settled down, and fembots are never far from his mind. My perfect robot companion would actually look very, very human. I really hate that people get the impression that people who are into this want to have sex with toasters or appliances or things like that. No, that's not the case at all. It's about being with somebody without all the strings that come attached with being with another person. And I think I can fall in love with a robot because that companion is all that I would want in a person. And that companion is someone that would want me. It's the day before Doug Hines is due to reveal Roxi to the public for the first time. And so this is Roxi. And Doug is confident she will wow the crowds with her artificial intelligence. As we all know, we all have multi-faceted, different personalities, different, you know, moods. So there's different versions of Roxi program-wise, where she'll respond differently. There's even Frigid Farah. Farah is very reserved. We have other personalities that are much more aggressive, as well as S-and-M, and everything else you can... There's five different types. And now I can finally share it, so we're very excited about this moment right now. The adult expo is in full swing and Roxi is about to make her grand entrance. Put her in the wheelchair. Doug has invested a lot of his time and money in her. There you go, honey. So there's a lot at stake for her big debut. Roxi's a little shy the first time she's out. It looks like a lot of people are here, Roxi. [man] She does not look good. With the crowd commenting on Roxi's appearance, even Doug's wife Sandy is becoming concerned. [Sandy] She needs a touch-up. She's not quite ready for show. She looks like she had a rough night. The pressure has started to get to Doug and Sandy has to lend a woman's touch. -Give her to me. -Don't mess her hair up. -I understand, honey. -I'm not fixing it again. Doug is hoping to sell Roxi for $6,000 per model. But it's touch-and-go whether he'll have her ready for her Vegas premiere. Even so, Doug is nothing if not an indefatigable salesman. We're the future. You cannot catch a disease from her. She cannot have an argument with you. She cannot say no to you. She's always willing to please you. She's willing to be your partner, your companion. As Roxi is not yet on the market... Come in. ...Keizo has bought what he believes is the next best thing. I thought a doll was a precursor to fembots. I mean you have one of the classic things that most people who like fembots, um, have, and that's the blank stare, the unawareness. I can actually move the doll, much like you can move a human being. They do have a very good range of motion. Very, very realistic. Did I ever have sex with it? Uh, yes! Yes, I did. I mean, take a look. Looks like fun, doesn't it? And yes, it was fun. And the thing is, though, that it's a long way from a fembot. It can't move. It can't do things on its own. It just pretty much lies there. To me, it was kinda like having a robot fantasy, but I had to fantasize about the robot being deactivated. Which could be fine, but that didn't really do it for me. I like having some kind of feedback. I like the girl to actually be a little aggressive too. Sex dolls are a million-dollar industry. But Keizo hopes to throw his doll away once sex robots hit the market. I think we will get used to the concept, the idea that some people have sex with robots the way we got used to the idea that some people have sex with dolls. I don't think it will be a mainstream thing that everybody is gonna have sex or a relationship with a robot. I think it will be a certain sub-population of people, and that they will be more accepted over time than they are now because people's minds are gonna widen, people are gonna get used to all kinds of interactions with technology. Some fembot enthusiasts can't wait for the technology to arrive and so find other ways to satisfy their fetish. Edward's favorite way is to manipulate photographs of his girlfriend Jen. The intent is to make them look more like a robot, but it's not really so much that you want to make them less of a person. I was actually adding some lines here and putting a little bit of glow on them as well. It just sort of enhances the whole idea that you are relating with something that's been augmented or is artificial but is looking at you with intelligence, intent and emotion. I don't want to lose her behind all this. And that's pretty much true for the whole thing in general. Yeah, I'm interested in all of this. Yeah, it's a big part of my life but I don't want to lose sight of her behind it. [man] When you look at that, is that arousing, that picture? Oh, quite. It's actually quite arousing to look at, for me, anyway. Rather exciting. Yeah, very arousing. Jen and Edward have been together for a year. Jen was unfazed when Edward told her about his robot fetish. [Jen] It was very anti-climactic. And I think he mentioned it, and I'm like, "cool." People have strange sexualities all over the place, and there's really no such thing as a norm. [man] And have you always felt okay about it? I can see where it could be highly threatening. Uh... It doesn't threaten me. I'm not being replaced. I'm right here. I've been with him the whole time. Why would I be replaced by a robot? [Edward] And there's the picture you saw to start with. Bodylines. [Jen] Oooh, that's really cool. With Jen embracing his robot fetish, Edward is hoping to take it to the next level by hypnotizing her into becoming a robot. If she were to move that kind of robotic way while we were in the bedroom, it would be a lot of fun, quite a lot, but it's not going to change the way I feel about her. I love her for her, not what we're doing in the bedroom. That is really cool. I have no idea how you do that. I'll show you sometime. In Vegas, the day of Roxi's grand unveiling dawns. For Doug and his wife, it's been a busy and exhausting night perfecting Roxi's look. He pretty much worked all night. I think he slept maybe, I dunno, an hour or two. I heard things popping and cracking. You know, it's like you sleep with one eye open. But with only a few minutes to go, Doug and Roxi are nowhere to be seen. Listen, Doug, listen to me. And in a few minutes on the stage behind me, Inventor Douglas Hines will introduce to the world the Roxi True Companion, what he's touting as the world's first sex robot. With seconds to spare, Roxy is finally switched on. [Doug] Today is a momentous occasion. We've created the world's first sex robot. This is Roxi. Roxi True Companion is a self-contained robot. She has touch sensors, pressure sensors throughout her body. For instance, if I touch her here... [Roxi] I love holding hands with you. She wants to hold hands with me. Now, she has three inputs, so, what you can think of for a woman, she can do. And she can do a little more than a woman. If you go down here... -[Roxi] Stop that! -[Doug] I'm sorry. -[Roxi] Oooh. -[Doug] I'm sorry, Roxi. I was just telling our fans what you're up to. [man] Thank you very much, that's it. We'll stick around for photos. Doug has run out of time and is cut off mid-presentation. The unveiling may have been chaotic, but it created headlines around the world, and there were no difficult questions, except from the fembot enthusiasts. [man] It's basically a doll with a tape recorder. It doesn't react, and frankly, it's ugly. It really looks like an ugly man in drag. That's how ugly this is. Uh... I would not have sex with this with somebody's else's penis. [man] I can see where he's going with it. I don't think now was the best time to come out with it, cos if you're going to announce that you've created a sex robot, people are going to want to see it move. But it can't move on its own. And it can't turn its head or move its lips. If I could give him any advice as a member of this robot community, keep going, man. Keep trying. Keep refining. Keep building. As it stands right now, I don't see too many people wanting this version of Roxi. [manbot] Hello, I'm a sex robot and I'm glad and very pleased to meet with you. [hammering] Meanwhile, in a secret location in West Virginia, things are starting to heat up in the sex robot world. And Doug Hines and Roxi now have a competitor. His name is Scott Maclean, and away from the media fanfare, he's been quietly building his own sex robot. [Scott] Hello! [manbot] Hello. I am a sex robot, and I'm glad and very pleased to meet with you. [man] And how did you come up with the idea for a sex robot? We began in the boom of the construction, where everything was going. I decided we needed to put some money elsewhere, so all of our eggs were not in one basket. And somebody sat at a table, one of my men, and said, "If you wanna really do something that'll make money, create something that does the dishes and returns sexual favors." They decided there was already an automatic dishwasher, so here I stand. This one right here was about the second prototype that we built, trying to carry more weight, silicone, et cetera. In that process, it became violently strong. This thing would break you. It scared me. It's been disassembled so nobody will get hurt with it. Yeah, you can't be intimate with something that's... You might as well go out there and be intimate with a heavy piece of equipment on a job site. That's about how safe it was, so it wasn't acceptable. After his problems with the prototype, Scott went on to build "Harry Hard-Drive," a safer sex robot aimed at women. This one here, this is one of the latest basic prototypes. This is almost the finished product, other than the skin isn't quite real enough. It is squishy. It's got, you know, touch sensitivity. It can be to size specifications, looks, whatever your whims are. It can also be cleaned very easily. Uh... That's, of course, an important part because of what you're talking about doing with it as an adult entertainment piece. And you see I'm touching him so he's already trying to go. And now these switches we could put anywhere -- See, he fell over because I did it quick and propped him up. So this actually has a human-type joint, and if I move this out, this is a human action. You can see it has a pelvic type of thrust. Scott has emphasized the thrusting physical attributes to his robot unlike Doug who tends to stress Roxi's different personalities. That's what it's about, right there. Scott's in-laws have turned up to make a promotional video for Harry and his female companion, Suzi Software. [woman] Oh, wow. [Scott] There it goes. This right here makes the neck go. The torso goes just by pushing the other way. -This won't hurt it, right? -No, not for the most part. [man] Make her head move! -[chuckles] -Make her head move. There we go. Mmm! Yeah! Mmm! Scott says his robots have so far cost him almost half a million dollars, so he's keen to get them on the market as quickly as possible. [woman] Hmm. All the right parts move, yeah. [Scott] You can practice your art of adult movie-making. Harry and Suzi will sell for up to $11,000 apiece. Scott's confident that his robots will appeal to both men and women, gay and straight, and he's hoping to sell hundreds. An individual here could have a doll. An individual on the other side of this planet has a doll and the four of you are having sex basically together. A ménage à trios taken to a whole different level. They're not going to tell the next day. They're not going to say anything, and you won't wake up with any venereal disease. While Scott is bright and sunny about the future of his robots, life isn't always so easy for the customers he's targeting. In our culture, in the American culture, we celebrate sex, we advertise it, we promote it, we publicize it, we use it, we sell it. And then on the... that's on the overt. On the covert side, we carry deep degrees of shame around sex, so I would say that fetishes are generally embedded with shame. Keizo is so ashamed of his robot fetish that he's kept it hidden from his family. This is something that I've kept pretty much a secret most of my life. This is not something that I normally talk about. This is not something that I think people will accept. My family will not accept this. I know this. Uh, some of my friends will not accept this. I have to worry about my job, my future jobs. Keeping this a secret has been a burden on me, and basically being ashamed of something that I shouldn't even be ashamed of. But Keizo has decided to talk about it for the first time with his friends, Christian and Alexis. [Alexis] I guess I really don't know a whole lot about what it is exactly that you're into. I'm just genuinely curious. [Keizo, chuckling] It's not like I really talk about this very often actually. Christian just barely found out, and that's because it's something that I don't really feel is generally accepted in society. You know, this has been an interest for me ever since I was a kid, but it sort of evolved and every time I had heartbreak, every time I had a... you know, a rejection or something like that, that was always in the back of my mind, that maybe this would be an option for me someday. Do you think that, you know, that sex would be an equal part of that as well? [Keizo] Absolutely. Just about any fantasy you have can be indulged without having to be afraid of judgement, you know. Like, "Can you believe what he did last night? It was disgusting." But you can always have the final say. Um, and I know that does sound a bit controlling, but I guess, in the realm of fantasy, you know, we're always in charge. [Alexis] If they look like a real woman and they feel like a real woman, how is that not going to distort how they think that real woman are supposed to be? Then they kinda disconnect from wanting to be with a real woman because their robot woman would be perfect. So it does kinda make me a little nervous a bit, but, you know, again, if it makes them happy, then who is it really harming? So it's a hard line to kinda decide. [Helliesen] A robot fetish is more of a male thing because women are more encouraged to quietly repress, sometimes, their desires. Um, so it's okay for men to go out there and explore and be curious, while for women it's more complicated. Women tend to want a bit more than just a quick release. They would like to have a connection with the person they are having sex with. [Scott] Say hi, wild thing. In West Virginia, Scott's sexbots are getting ready for a special visitor. Scott's going to show them to Delosian. [Scott] This will be the first time that somebody with the fetish has actually met a sexbot. If he frowns, I'll say, "What's wrong with it?" If he grins, I'm gonna cheer and say, "What else do you want?" I'm sure he's seen it on the Internet. But to see it face to face, this is gonna be... this is making my day. [Delosian] I've seen his website. But I'm not expecting anything earth-shattering. I don't expect to walk into the room where the robot is and see a human female standing there. -[man] Are you excited? -Curious. And I'm "anxious," I think would be a better word, just to see what he's done, because I think it's important, I think it's time. We haven't got our flying cars yet like we were supposed to, so let's get our robots done. -Hey! -Hi! It's a serious pleasure to meet you. -I'm Scott. -I'm Delosian. Well, let's rock. By the way, this is the man cave where all prototyping begins, right here. Here they sit. Um, that's the male. This is the female. -Intimidated or...? -No. Intrigued or...? Definitely intrigued. Not intimidated at all. Um, it looks very realistic. [Scott] It's got battery packs in it. You can recharge it, or you can also plug into like off a jumpbox 12 volt. Your cigarette lighter. She still has all the details, et cetera. If you're interested, you can go over and pick one up. It won't hurt you. You can't really hurt it. It is, you know, it would actually take about a third of the weight still off of it. You're kidding me?! [Scott] Yeah, it's gonna be about a third lighter. That's incredible. [Scott] Her face is removable. Her skin is removable. Will you always want blonde, white, or would you like to try a different race, a different creed, a different color? We're gonna try to make it so that, as you change, it can change with you. In moving, I guess I should show you that. Well, I can do this, you know, and its waist even goes. How would you like to make a porno? How much money have you got? -No, not you. -Huh? -They don't need you. -I get what you're saying. -[Scott] That's more... -[Delosian] There you go. [Scott] You see the back actually articulates because, in those motions, hers does the same. Tell me what you think. Wow! Where do I begin? Well, first of all, to a certain extent, I am speechless. Right now, I'm just kinda taking it in. Like getting pulled over by a cop, don't know what to say. It's very cool. Thank you. I'm happy, we're doing it right. Well, this has been great, and we will stay in touch. -[Delosian] Absolutely. -[Scott chuckles] [Delosian] He's definitely on the right track. I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. And I know the skin is a little rough and the creases in the neck, and I know it's just gonna get better from here, so I think you'll probably see these on the market more sooner than later. The day has dawned for Edward's big experiment. Too impatient to wait for a viable sex robot, he has decided to turn his girlfriend Jen into a robot. [woman] Since I'm creating a robot for you and for your personal enjoyment... So he's drafted in an erotic hypnotist who calls herself Lady Ru'etha. There's a heavy association with hypnosis and control. To an extent, it's a fallacious association in that somebody who's in hypnosis is ultimately in control of their actions, but sometimes, it doesn't feel that way. And for a lot of people, that's really hot, and that's really erotic, and that's a lot of fun. So, whatever position you're most comfortable in on the bed. [man] So, Edward, what are you hoping for out of this session? I hadn't even dared to hope that this would happen ever, so I really hadn't thought that much ahead as to what to hope for. Mostly, that it will be something that she enjoys, or won't be scared by or made nervous about. And I want you to just focus on my eyes for a moment. You find yourself going deeper into hypnosis and deeper into that calm, comfortable place in your center. Beginning now. And the voice in your ear says, "Preparing to commence robotization program." Do you consent to become a robot? Answer "affirmative" or "negative." [metronome ticking] Affirmative. Lady Ru'etha has a special way of heightening the experience of becoming a robot by storing erotic feelings in what she calls a "pleasure battery." At this point, pleasure battery installation will begin. The pleasure battery will allow the unit to save physical pleasure, whether that be erotic pleasure, tactile pleasure, emotional pleasure, or mental pleasure. Pleasure battery installation beginning. Twenty, 40, 60, 80, 100%. Pleasure battery installed. Operating system installation and activation complete. The unit will respond by saying "acknowledged." Acknowledged. Activate Unit Jen. Acknowledged. You'll want to bring up the default skin when you have the stilted movement, the dolly voice. Acknowledged. [Edward] Very good. Look at me. Does this please you? Does it please you? It pleases me very well. Then it pleases me. Directive two: obedience is pleasure. Pleasure is obedience. State directive two. Obedience is pleasure. Pleasure is obedience. Excellent! Kiss me. It's the next morning. Jen and Edward have been playing robots for much of the night. Seeing Jen as a robot, don't even have to think about -- fantastic. I don't have to think what word do I need to describe it -- fantastic. I kinda felt more like a cyborg actually, like I wasn't fully a robot, I was robotic. More half-robot, half-human. I am really pleased that we found each other. -Quite pleased. -Me, too. That's good. That's good. One chief aspect of male sexuality is the idea of having a female that is submissive and is controllable, and the concept of a robot is submissive and controllable, that basically you are the boss of that robot. Those fantasies, the dominant/submissive fantasy, are probably the most common sexual fantasy that's played out in human sexual behavior, currently. At his home in New Jersey, Doug has been working hard on improving Roxi since her unveiling in Las Vegas. And so Delosian is keen to meet her in the flesh in the hope that Doug's claim that Roxi is the world's first sex robot lives up to the hype. I'm hoping to see Roxi actually move unassisted. Hopefully, he's improved upon the face, cos let's face it, if you have an ugly doll or an ugly robot, nobody's going to buy it anyway. Hey, Delosian. How are you? Come on in. This is my wife, Sandy. -Hi. -Sandy, Delosian. This is Missy. Why don't we just sit down and just, you know, talk for a few minutes? Roxi wants some attention over there. We'll get to you Roxi, don't worry. So much goes into just that smile, it's unbelievable. She has nipples, she has a vagina. And so if I were to show you... uh, down here... you can see she has a true woman's vagina. -Yeah. [chuckles] -It's accurate there. [Delosian] Obviously, one of the big things, especially with Roxi being this size, would be the ease of cleaning the orifices. -Yep. We have a kit. -But is it removable? It's also removable. What we've done is we've created a true-life tongue. If you don't mind, just touch it. Check this out, man. The tongue is vibrating very rapidly. [device humming] I see where you're going with that. [Doug] Nobody's doing stuff like this. She actually has smiled. Oh, thank you, Roxi. You're a nice girl, Roxi. So, what do you think? Well, I see a lot of improvements from the unveiling in Vegas. She can move her head. And the fact that it's all, the responses are all internalized now as opposed to, you know... That the sensors work and she responds, that's really cool. I gotta admit, I wasn't sure what to expect, but the fact that she is moving a little bit the face a little bit better, I definitely see improvements. -Cool, I appreciate it. -She's just getting better. [Delosian] Thank you so much, and I'll be in touch. All right, Delosian. Thank you. -Have a good day. -Bye-bye. Doug is now offering different versions of Roxi from his website. We're in the business of giving people unconditional love. And that means helping people to find something they're missing, whether it's companionship, social interaction, whether it's a sexual aspect. We're able to help people kinda fulfill whatever it is that makes them happy, help them achieve those goals, and what's wrong with making people happy when no one's hurt? It's all good. [Delosian] He's definitely taken a few larger strides. He's really working on trying to get this robot to actually move and be a robot as opposed to just a doll, which is what it was in January, in my opinion. He's making the strides to make it more animatronic. I thought the body was sexy. The fact that it's 5'6" makes me happy cos I'm just a little taller than that, so it's almost like really life-size for me. [man] Would you like to have sex with her now, in the state she's in now? Would I like to have sex with her right now? Maybe. [chuckles] Maybe. I can't give you a yes or no. The fembot enthusiasts eagerly await the day when sex robots become a reality. But are we ready to embrace this brave new world? The problem with technology is that technology is amoral. It has no morality. It has no ethics. We never really stop and ask ourselves should we, or is it a good thing? You may or may not want all that many people having sex with robots. I'm not sure as a society we've agreed that that's where we wanna go. But with the increasing impact of technology on our lives, love and sex with robots is coming whether we like it or not. I think robot love will definitely feel as normal as human-human love and it will become accepted by an increasing proportion of the population. If you said to somebody at the beginning of the 20th century that by the end of this century, men will be marrying men and women marrying women, they would laugh at you and cart you off to the nearest lunatic asylum. Just look how much human-human relationships have changed, and our acceptance of different types of relationships have changed over the past hundred years, or even the past 50 years. [Delosian] I think it's a very exciting time for people in the community who have always dreamt of the day when someone could own a humanoid robot. And I think a lot of people are going to be satisfied when it actually reaches that point. And it's gonna be coming very soon.
