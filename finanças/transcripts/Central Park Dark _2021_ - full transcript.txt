I know because I have a few of them. Yeah, I've been at the retirement party, didn't you get my call? Ah, I'm sorry, I was in surgery. Well, I should go so I can make my flight. You said you wanted to try to make it here. Yeah, look, yeah, I know I did- - Yeah, I know, a bar full of old drinking buddies doesn't sound so good to me either. I'm sorry, I was in surgery. Is Tom coming? Oh. Tell him he must. So you don't care about your old mentor? Look, I'd love to see ya, I would- - Your fate is not your intentions, but your actions. Okay. Cranberry juice, and could you put it in a wine glass, please? These days I keep things light. I tell jokes. Why are there so many blondes in hell? Because they're so friggin' hot. You are not allowed in here anymore. What are you talking about? Out! Any red's fine, I'm a quantity over quality kinda girl. You are going to get me fired. That is not in your future. John says you do a lot more than tell fortunes across the street. - Thomas! - George! How wonderful to see you. Let me get you some of what we're having. I wanted you to catch my wife and some other folks, but they've left already, so we're the last of the group. We are the veritable drunks, and I have every intention of getting quite ripe, and your late arrival provides me the perfect excuse. Well, here is to the perfect excuse. That's the spirit, my boy! Yeah. This guy is not only the finest doctor, but the kindest. I can't tell you how many patients have come up. Anybody 10 years younger than me has got, stay for another round. As Virgil wrote... Anna. Wow. You look stunning. I thought you quit drinking. I did. Till tonight. What happened, peer pressure from your friends? Ah, I guess. I almost had a year. That sounds about right. That was the last time I heard from you. I was on probation at the hospital, and oh, to hell with all that stuff. Anyways, I head upstate before rush hour these days. You already finish that? Yes, do try to keep up. Would you like another? Put your phone down and politely answer me. Yes. To you. The one you forgot about. Oh, I remember that. Thomas. Hmm? Go home. Hey. Can we start over again? From the beginning? Only if you do what you promised me. Let's get outta here. That's a yes? Good evening. Shh. What? Relax, you know, there are people live here. I got this as a present. It's gonna torture me. Yes! Yes, I will be right back! Voila. Do you and Brenda still have sex? Not like we did. I like hearing that. You calling us we again. That's pretty. It used to be my mother's. I wish she'd met you. My grandfather used to live on Central Park West, and my mother and I lived with him in his last sick years. I remember. Sometimes my mother would turn off all the lights and we'd sit high above the park, and she'd read from Sarah Mae's journal. Who's that? An ancestor. Are you religious? I always wanted to know. No. Do you consider yourself spiritual? I'm a doctor. That's your answer? I believe you live and then you die, and I'm gonna go to sleep now, okay? No, Thomas, you never talk to me. Well, my father was a very religious man, but his religion didn't allow for medicine, so I was forced to watch my mother wither and die, when science could have saved her, so. So you became a doctor. I don't know why we're talking about this. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Remember our weekend in the Catskills? That's when you first promised me that you'd leave her. This is a better time for us. I don't wanna get ahead of myself but, I believe in eternity. Remember the first night we met? So where should we go? You live in this building? I love Central Park West. This is how you can remember my name. ♪ Ah Na ♪ I like your two sinks. Which one does your wife use? You aren't regretting this already, are you? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck. Good morning, sweetie pie. I ran out and I got more champagne and I made mimosas. I also got vodka. I was thinking, we should go to the park today. I got a conference on Monday. Ah, that's Monday. No, I need to prepare. We never do anything in the daytime together. I need to prepare. You can later. I really wanna have a picnic in the park. All right. Let me look at my computer, okay? Okay. Don't you take off just yet. I have an idea. Come here! So, Anne, you wanna sit here? No. Can I give you my private tour? Sure. My mother and I used to spend days discovering the park. Follow me. Okay. There's an old path here. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I can't trespass. This used to always be open, but now it's shut off so not many people go. I don't know. Thomas, no one's gonna care if you jump over this low fence. All right, all right, all right, here. See, now wasn't that fun? Come on. It's hard to believe that this actually exists. These days if something isn't on the official map, it doesn't exist. Yeah. Huh. My mother used to call this the wise woman tree. Really? Sounds like she was really imaginative. This is something we used to do together. You have to try this with me. You're insane. Come on! You're insane. I just remembered my mother buried something here. That's bizarre. What was it? I can't remember what or where. Hey look, Anna, you know, that's great, but can we eat, I'm hungry. That's your way of ending a discussion, I see. All I said is that I'm hungry, okay? Well let's eat here. That's fine, let's eat here. So what do you do these days? "What do you do?" Give me a break. You certainly didn't care last night. Excuse me for wanting to get to know you a little better. Why don't you ask more important questions? Like why were we brought together again, alone, here? I don't know. I'll give you one guess. I give up. Play, come on, hide and seek! I feel like I'm with my daughter now. How is Mandy? She just turned 15 a few weeks ago. Lovely. Now, come on. Anna! Anna! Come on! Anna! Anna! This is crazy. I can't believe this shit. Anna! Come on! Anna! Anna, come on! Christ! Anna, I've been shouting your name! Didn't you hear me? Oh, I guess I didn't. No? What is that? I feel comfortable with you, so I hope I can tell you anything. Yeah? Like what? I feel something here. A presence. Oh man, cut the crap. You think I'm kidding, but I'm receptive. Okay, good or bad? I don't know, or I shouldn't say. Can you read my mind right now? I have a pretty good idea what you think. Yeah? Well I'm thinking that you're acting fucking cuckoo. You're an asshole. Wait. Wait Thomas, I know, sometimes I'm too much. I tried to have an open mind. The trespassing, the graveyard. I've had it, I just can't do this anymore. Thomas- - I'm gonna go grab the rest of our stuff, okay? No, no, let's make a fire. What? Absolutely not. Why not? No one would notice. It's illegal. Thomas, sit down. Sit down, okay? Relax a little, okay? When do you ever get to just let go a little? That's all we're doing, right? Hang on, hang on. I'm feeling a little- - Thomas, kiss me. I'm feeling a little not right. I need to sit down and breathe. Are you all right? I'm feeling a little not good. It's happening again. I can hear it. I can hear it calling me. Hi. I'd given up hearing from you. Oh, how's Philly, how's your sister and Brian? They're fine. No, it's actually been a really good trip. Oh, Mandy wanted to know if you'd Skype with her. Okay, I will. All right, I love you. Love you, gotta go. Hey Dad. Hey honey. I'm kinda jealous you're in the city. Look, I got that bracelet you gave me. I'm working on my science fair project. I ran out of time to do that. I see. Please don't lecture me about time management, because Mom already did that. I gotta meet Jen. Chat soon? Bye. Oh well. Here to see Dr. Winters, right? Yep, he said he'd leave me a key since I'm arriving so late. Night owl, eh? Yeah. Me too. He didn't mention anything about a key, though. Ah, he said you have one for the cleaning lady. Yes ma'am. Don't call me ma'am, it's Anna. Here you go, Anna. Thank you. My mother used to say that Central Park was a cemetery for broken hearts and broken souls, called The Unrequited, and they don't rest in peace. She was one of them. Sarah Mae too. Her one wish for me was that I never become one. Now that we're back together again, her wish has come true. Some people have what they don't deserve. What the hell are you doing? I'm calling the cops. Hey. How'd you get in here? I'm here so you can apologize. Apologize? What on Earth would I have to apologize for? I'm the one who woke up in the dark, and it was startling to say the least. I don't know what you're talking about, you left me. Oh, give me a break. Oh, no, no, no, you're not sitting down. I want you to gather up your stuff, okay? I don't have anything here. Well then gather up some of Brenda's stuff you used. So you're already sick of me? Oh, oh, hey honey. How's Philly? I'm back. You know I have patients on Sunday now. Sorry, I was just concentrating. - Yeah! - What's that noise? TV, the TV. So are you still thinking about coming up here tonight? Oh, I wish, but I finally got the dishwasher guy to come upstate early tomorrow. Maybe I can meet you after your conference downtown. Well let's figure that out later, okay? Oh. My next session's starting. Hey, you shouldn't get into stuff like this. Mind your business, lady. Hey, oh my god! Hey. Are you all right? I like your elephant. You can talk to me if you want. My mom's just not good. You want a hug? I gotta go. Bye. Yes Mom. Yes Mom. Dearest beloved, it's happening again. The ground is calling me. Anna. Hey, I have to ask you something. I've not seen you in centuries. You let the last man go and the one before that. You don't follow through with the ritual. Why does it have to be Thomas? Can't I just have a baby with any guy? You remember nothing! You began the ritual with Thomas a year ago, when the Unrequited Constellation was aligned with the Black Moon. So now your curse can only be lifted by a new life. - A baby? - Yes. Or you could sacrifice a young virgin, which I'm sure you're not up for. Okay, so I'll complete it with Thomas, I'll do it this time. Nah, you will be so soft and let him go. Thanks for your words of encouragement. Hey, it's Anna, your old patient. I was wondering if I could come back. I feel like only you can help me. One night, my mother was really drunk and popping pills. She convinced herself that some of Sarah Mae's suggestions would work on Phillip, this guy she loved. After many drinks, they headed into the park. I knew what she was doing. It was what Sarah Mae wrote about, a spell, black magic. At first, the spell seemed to work, because he'd loved her. I figured I'd head home. I was pushed from behind. It was Phillip, he had the knife. He said if I did what he said, I'd be okay. I saw the world of dark, and I entered it. You see me as a bad person. You're projecting. How old were you? 12. Well, I have something you don't. Broken people have a strength you'll never touch. No, the conference is an all day event. Ah, fuck. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. Tuesday, yeah, Tuesday, bye. Hey, did I miss a call from you? Yeah, your girlfriend was here. Excuse me, I'm married. Anyways, I didn't know if you were home. She left. Hey Vincent. As a doorman, it's my job to keep everyone's business to themselves. I appreciate that. Do you still have season tickets? Yes I do. My nephew's birthday's coming up. Oh. I see. Thanks. Hey. Hey. Yeah. Hey, I don't like how I just ran out earlier, so I just wanted to say a proper goodbye, because that seems to be what you want. Okay, thanks, I appreciate it. Wait, wait! What? So goodbye? Goodbye, Anna. No, no, no. We should at least have a walk in the park or something. - A last one. - No, no, I- Thomas! It's gotta be quick, let's go, come on. It's so gorgeous out tonight. Oh Thomas, I love this spot. What? I love this. Yeah. - It looks great, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Do you hear that? What? What? Anna. I didn't hear it. I don't see anything you see, and I don't hear anything you hear. I never have, okay? So, goodbye. Goodbye, Anna. Thomas! I knew he was back to prescribing pills for himself, mixed with intense drinking. The sweats, the behavior. After all, I knew him. I knew him very well. Thomas! You can't just leave me. Hey, hey. I'm her boyfriend, okay guys? Is she okay? Yeah, she's fine. I'm her boyfriend. She has these episodes, I'm her boyfriend and her doctor, okay? You want us to call the police or anything? Oh, that's not necessary, it really isn't, it really isn't. It looks a lot worse than it is. Hey honey. I'm her doctor, you guys. Okay, thank you. One, two, and three. Okay, we did it. You okay? All right, let me get your purse. No, no, no, I got you, I got you, I got you. It's gonna be fine. Let's go now, let's go home. All right, ready? Thanks, you guys! I don't know what happened out there. I'll tell you after I rest more. You asked who my ancestor Sarah Mae was. She'd been thrown out of Ireland for doing spells and magic, and even though her country was in the middle of the great potato famine, her town bought her a ticket to the new world on a coffin ship. Called that because so many people died aboard. Sarah Mae found her way to Seneca Village, the village they destroyed to build Central Park. There were schools, churches. History doesn't mention the darker side of the village. Here Sarah Mae met her people, West Africans who taught her voodoo, which she really made her own. They worshiped, they prayed. I won't tell you who they prayed to. Thomas, kiss me. No. Kiss me. No. Tear me apart. Stop it. You shouldn't drink like that. What the hell do you care? You don't give a shit about me. Okay, so rest up and you can leave in the morning. Well, if you want me to go then, I'll just go now. Okay, if that's what you want. Nice. You know what- - You arrogant fuck. You know what, you win. That's it. Bitch, I'm done with you, let's go. Uh-uh, I think it's time we talk about the elephant in the room, sit down. Okay. What would that be? The fact that we both know it's time for you to leave Brenda. Thomas, I love you. Tell me you love me, it'll probably feel good to get it out in the open. Come here. Come here. I will never love you. You told me. What woman would believe a man who says year after year he's gonna leave his wife, and he never does it? You said you wanted to have a baby with me. That was a long time ago, I was drunk! I could've had a life. A family. It's too late now. Bullshit. You'd make a horrible, horrible fuckin' mother. Good to hear what you really think of me. You need to get the fuck outta here. Get the fuck outta here. Anyhow, we already performed the ritual. Or most of it, anyway. What the fuck you talking about? Well, it was broken up, but some of it was we made love, spun around, I bundled the twigs. Oh, but you don't believe in that stuff. You need to get outta here, right now. Say you love me. Go to fuckin' hell. Okay. Fine, I'll get outta your fucking life! Maybe you just want me to jump outta this fucking window! Bye! Have you seen anyone? Oh, come on. Those season tickets, I have 'em. You can have as many as you fuckin' want, just tell me. Have you seen anyone? Thank you. And no, I haven't seen anyone. Thanks. Good night, Thomas. Good night. Thomas. The last thing I wanted to do was hurt you, but it's still on the list. If I follow through with the unnameable with you, you won't be my first. Are you nuts? I'm not going in the park with you! My cat has never been gone for that long before. It's been three weeks. There's a way, but it's my premium service. Okay, that's fine. Whatever it is, I'm willing to pay. Hi Thomas. Vincent, hey. Question. These security cameras are all around the building? Who's in charge of those? Not me. No, not you? Who then? Well, it used to be Hector. Hector. Who's Hector? I'm just gonna be straight with you, the system broke. It was never replaced. The cameras are basically just for show now. Really? So it's all bullshit? Pretty much. Okay, thanks. Anytime. Why are you still in the city? You'd be proud, I was a speaker at the American Board of Ophthalmology convention today. I'm like so sorry I missed that. So how'd your science project go? Mandy! Oh my god, Dad! What is going on with you? I just saw a figure pass behind you. Don't joke around like that. Mandy, it's very immature. Dad, I wouldn't lie to you, I promise. I've had it with your schoolgirl pranks. I'm signing off. Bye bye. I like being out with my beautiful wife. Give me a break. The only time you compliment me is when you're wasted. Come on, I'll drive us upstate. No. Why are you drinking? What happened? Brenda, I'm having a glass of wine, I'm fine. Bullshit. You never have just one. Come on. Look, aren't gonna ask me how my speech was, hm? How was your day? Well, I got a message from a former patient, wants to return to therapy. Oh, and? And we weren't very successful a few years ago. I believe if a patient reaches out for help, you should give him a second chance. Anyone who thinks that only someone else can save them is already lost. I can't believe you just said that. I can't believe it. Why? Am I the only one who can save you? I just realized, I can't come upstate with you. Why? An emergency surgery came up, for the morning. You sure you can do a surgery? Go upstate. I don't wanna leave you when you're like this. I just wanna be alone. Please? You know what? Fine. Could I have another? You must think about when we first met. Which one does your wife use? Look, it's three-three-three. Won't you pray with me? We should go in the park. It's amazing in the dark. I really wanna give you my private tour. Come on. Follow me. There's a path back here. ♪ Central Park ♪ ♪ Quiet and dark ♪ ♪ Circle the fire ♪ ♪ Come meet me ♪ ♪ When it's three-three-three ♪ Come when I call. There are so many hidden symbols in the park. The Unrequited can read them, of course. Sarah Mae was very close with one of the architects of the park. They worshiped together. I won't tell you which. I'm a part of a long, powerful history. Lifting the Unrequited Curse has steps. It starts simply, ends rather badly. It's sort of a game. After all, isn't that what you played with me? Or maybe it's more like a puzzle. Remember when we went to the fair? You won me a teddy bear. Oh, Thomas, I loved you. I want you to know I did struggle with this decision. But if you want to lift the curse and have a baby, it's time to do the unnameable. It's Thomas's day of reckoning. I'd never do anything like that. I'd been doing really good. Okay, fine. Your way. Beloved, I call thee. Ye heart that longs and yearns. Love unrequited, twice burns. Only sacrifice or new life cures the pain. Then you return to thyself again. Follow the dark towards eternity. Listen, the ground is calling me. The ground is calling me. Got it. Thomas. - Hey. - The usual? Tommy boy, so great to see you. Hey, retirement is fabulous. Sometimes Eddie lets me watch the news here instead of at home. What is it? Start from the beginning. Eddie, can you turn the news down, please? My hearing. George, can I trust you? Absolutely. I fucked up. I mean, at your retirement party, I met this girl. And I thought it was only gonna be like a one night thing, but it's continued, you know. She won't stop calling me- - Doctor, hold on. I need something stronger. You fucked up, Tommy. I did. Yeah. Now listen to me clearly. If you wanna save your marriage- - I do. - Mea culpa, mea culpa. Tell Brenda now. I don't think I can. Fuck your ego, Tommy. You could lose everything. Okay. I'm gonna tell her. Hey, your girlfriend, I mean your blonde friend was here. She said she'll meet you at the pond at 11 p.m. What? She said meet her at the pond at 11 p.m., as planned. Okay, thanks. Thank you, Vincent. You're welcome. Hi, it's Thomas. I'm not feeling well, I have the flu. Would you have Roberts take my calls today? I'm sure I'll feel better tomorrow, thanks. Bye. Wow, I'm just in my own world, I guess. Yeah, exactly why I thought I'd come and see you tonight. I have a few appointments tomorrow. I thought you'd appreciate the company. That's great, honey. I haven't been drinking. I'm your wife, I'm not your babysitter or your sponsor. I know. I know. Listen. I'm sorry about the other night. I'm starting at day one again, okay? I'm glad to hear it. Oh, how'd those get so dirty? I wasn't wearing 'em. Certainly not my style. You know, Mandy called me in an absolute fright about your Skype call the other night. She was pranking me. I'm just not tolerating that kind of thing. I don't think she'd do that. She's a teenager now. And? I don't know. Thomas, she sounded really frightened. Kiss me. Tear me apart. The heart that longs and yearns, love unrequited twice burns. Only sacrifice or new life cures the pain. Then you return to thyself. Follow the dark towards eternity. Listen, the ground is calling thee. Follow the dark, follow the dark. Only sacrifice or new life. Shh, you'll wake the baby. Thomas. What's wrong? I had a nightmare. Jesus, I'll get you some aspirin. What's this? It's a little trinket I found. I thought you'd like it. I like your wrapping paper. It reminds me of something. Let's just try to get some sleep. Hello. You're still in bed? I'm catching up on some rest. Well, you probably needed it. Most of the night you were shouting bloody murder. I had some intense nightmares. What do you think brought these on? Don't shrink me. I wasn't. Well, get your lazy bones out of bed. I'm getting up. You're finally coming upstate tonight, right? Yeah, yes, this evening. Okay, love you. Hey, excuse me. Oh, no, I was just wondering when the church is open? The church? They turn this building into condos now. Really? Yeah. Where were you all this time? I wanted to see a priest. Can't help ya. They're not good anyhow. No? Nobody is, right? Hey. Mom says you think I was playing a trick on you. Not true. I'm happy to see my beautiful daughter. That's not an apology. ♪ Central ♪ - What the- - Mandy! - Dad! - What?

Okay, so what do we do now? We should leave. Already? Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry, these things are not an exact science. Yeah, maybe it was all, you know, just in my head. Do you promise not to yell? Okay. So I remembered what my mother buried. Can you guess? A body? Whose? Why? I've no idea. Well, you have time to think about it. A little time, anyway. You think you're gonna actually dig a grave? What are you doing? Nothing you could possibly understand. Untie me. Let me go, please. Your voice is getting too loud for my taste. Anyway. Hey. It was great seeing you again. Now you can do whatever you wanna do to me. I intend to. I don't need your approval. But I just want you to know something, Anna, I always cared about you. Always. It wasn't just a front for me. You're just saying that now. But when I first met you, I knew you were special. Special how? That you were the one for me. That it was my destiny. You don't believe in that stuff. I believe in us. Do you mean that? Yes, I do. I'm a really great person once you get to know me. I know that, Anna. I will leave Brenda like I promised you. We'll have a big fancy dinner tomorrow night at your favorite spot. Wear a dress. Although you always look pretty. Untie me, please. Untie me. Can I just come home with you tonight? No, I wanna do this right. Tomorrow night, where? Chez Jean Pierre, 7:00 p.m. Hey, hey, don't follow me. Go before I change my mind. I have a date. Something to take the edge off? Once you told me that if I wish upon a star, I'm millions of years too late. This one's on me. This is war, my dear. And Mandy. Yes, I'm sorry, go ahead. Thomas, I just wanted to make sure you weren't running late or something. Call me. Don't you remember what I told you? So now your curse can only be lifted by a new life. - A baby? - Yes. Or you could sacrifice a young virgin, which I'm sure you're not up for. Oh, thank god you're here. Don't! I've not been feeling well. I figured out who this belonged to. It's a pretty sick gift, Thomas. I'm sorry. I don't even know who the hell you are anymore. I'm ashamed to be married to someone who's attracted to such a terribly disturbed person. Brenda, I'm so, so sorry. She was a client of mine two years ago. I had no idea. Well she did. Anna was enraged when I ended our sessions. I told her she had to stop drinking if she wanted our therapy to continue, and I knew that she couldn't. I hated our sessions. She believed she was a witch. Now that I do believe. You have clearly fucking lost it! Brenda, I swear, I- - I don't wanna see you ever again. Let's talk, you tell your patients to forgive. Oh, don't you dare! Go to hell, Thomas. I need you, Brenda. Don't come near me. Just realized something. I'm free of you. Oh Brenda, please don't go! Hello? Dad? Hey, Vincent. Don't smoke. Have you seen my father? No, but he's been spending a lot of time in the park. Okay. Well don't go there now. It's way too late. Excuse me? Have you seen a man, 50 years old, six feet, black hair? Sorry, no. Do you speak to spirits? Not always. I think my father has some like otherworldly things happening to him. Your father is in great pain. Do you know where I can find him? Yes, Thomas, Mandy came here. I think she went looking for you in the park. Okay look, I need you to go in the back and give me the gun back there. What? I don't have time for this bullshit, Vincent. Go in the back and get me that gun and give it to me. We got rid of it. You did? Fuckin' Christ. Oh, flashlight. Yeah. I'm so glad I ran into you. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. Okay. The ground is calling you. Get away from me! No, please! No, please. Walk around the candles. Please, no! You think about making a run for it, you're done. Walk faster. Walk faster. Ow. I hurt my ankle. Please, help me. Ow. Please, help! Please, help. Okay. All right, I'll help you. Ow, my ankle. Use this as a crutch. Don't put any weight on it. Go. Go, and call your dad. Okay. Oh my god. When she hurt her ankle, I had to help her. In the end I guess I did the right thing. I'm a decent human being. Are you decent? Are you human? Either way, your curse remains. - Tom, Thomas? - Hey. Hey. Can I give you a hand with that? Oh no, no, no. No, I'm exercising. It's just heavy, you don't wanna do it, you'll hurt your back or something. All right, Thomas. You have a nice evening. You too. Oh, fuck. Okay, come on. Hey Mandy, it's your father. I just got a missed call from you, and I was hoping you'd call me back as soon as you can and let me know that you're okay, okay hon? No! Mandy. Forgive me, honey. Honey, I'm okay. I mean, oh. I need help. What did the blonde say when she found out that she was pregnant? "Are you sure it's mine?" Hey. Get out of here. Get out of here!
