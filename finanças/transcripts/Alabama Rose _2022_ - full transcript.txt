That-- that was a bit much. -Do we have time? -Yeah, we'll be fine. It's funny, 'cause I'm judged because I'm a photographer, and you have assholes like that that can totally ruin it for you.

Before I call the cops. -Mary, I-- -Go! Mary, what was he doing here? I noticed Michael being weird earlier. First he shows up out of nowhere at the shoot. Then I saw the way he was lookin' at you. Now he's showing up creeping around your house? Are you gonna tell me what's going on with you two? Nothing happened. He's not gonna act like that for nothing. A few months after Trey passed, I must've called Michael, like, every night. Why? It wasn't like that. Or at least it didn't start out like that. I... [sighs] I just kept feeling like I was being watched, and I kept hearing noises all around the house. And all this time, it was him! What was him? The noises and me constantly feeling like I'm being watched! What's going on between you two? Usually... he-- he would just come over and he'd tell me that there was nobody here. But then this one night... [door creaks] -Anything? -[Michael] Nothin'. You gonna be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine. Grab me a pillow. Why? Instead of you calling me right when I make it home, maybe it'll be better for me to just sleep on the couch. No, you don't have to do that, Mike. I, um, I promise I won't call. [Michael] Look, it's okay. It's been hard on me too. I haven't really slept. Go get some rest and me a pillow. [Mary chuckles softly] Hurry up. I'm sleepy. Where's the blanket? [Mary] Good night.

I didn't know, but I figured something more happened, the way he was acting around you. Did you call him back after that? [sighs] No, I haven't talked to him since. I don't mean to be rude or anything, it's just it's weird. Him and Trey have always been so competitive, and I didn't wanna be the next thing. I don't know... Why didn't you call me?

No, it's for charity. Anybody can do it. Yeah, but those girls have, like, professional experience. It's not really like a modeling thing. It's more like the models are there so people donate. You should come. We'll see. Hey, whatever happened to that guy you mentioned? -What guy? -The tourist photographer guy? -You should shoot with him. -I don't know him. -Get to know him. -Nicole! Not like that. Just... You know, maybe you'd be more comfortable with him than one of my photographers. You never mentioned if he was cute. What difference does that make?

Let's just get everybody out of here. -Come on, y'all. -Come on, guys. [Mary] Come on, y'all. You too. I don't know what happened. Everyone is fine, seems to be minimal damage. So how'd this fire start anyway? Not sure, but have you two been checked out? I'm fine. All right, well, there's not much more we can do here tonight, so why don't you go home, -get some rest. -All right. What about you, sweetie? Have you been checked? No, I haven't, but I think I'm fine. I'm sure you're fine, but let me do my job. Come with me. -Hey, Mary. -Hey, Hank. So we good? We'll see. I'll be finished here shortly. How you doing? I just know it's these damn terrorists. I mean, every year they come here and fuck with my shit. Sorry, we're closed at the moment. Hey, what happened here? I saw a truck out front. Yeah, there was a fire here last night. -A fire? -Yeah. Hey, what happened to you last night? Yeah, sorry. I got caught up. Since you're asking me, I'm assuming you made a decision. Yeah, I did. I decided I'm not gonna do it. Really? So you were looking for me last night to tell me no. Why do you think that I was looking for you? You literally just asked what happened to me. Meaning you were looking. I was just observing my bar and I just noticed that you weren't there. -Oh, so you missed me? -No, I don't even know you. -Um... -I think you missed me. Hey, we can open back up tomorrow, okay? Okay. Do you need me to stay and help out? There's nothing more we can do now. I mean, uh, just take the day off. Okay. Thanks, Owen. How about we shoot this afternoon? -Today? -Yeah, why not? You don't have work anymore and I know the perfect place. Well, 'cause I already said no. Nah, you didn't mean it. Oh, my gosh, are you like this everywhere you go? I don't know. I haven't been everywhere. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. Tomorrow. -Tomorrow. -Okay. -Text me. -I'll do that. -I'll see you tomorrow. -See you tomorrow. -Adam is really good. -Yes he is. So you're shooting with that mysterious photographer tomorrow? It looks like it. What's the theme you're doing? [Adam] So, Who's this mysterious photographer y'all talking about? [chuckles] It's just this guy I met at a bar. [laughs] I know that sounds terrible, but it's not like I just met him. I mean-- I mean, I did just meet him, but it was like days ago. Well. You should be careful. I mean, there's... all sorts of things that that they use for ploys, -sex, human trafficking-- -What? -You name it. -Don't be jealous at him. She's still gonna shoot with you. I'm just saying be careful, that someone should probably go with it. -I'll go with you. -No, I'm-- I'll be fine. -These are amazing. -Yeah, they are. -I'm so proud of you. -Thanks, Nic. -How are you? -This place is beautiful. Look at that. A tourist is showing you around your own town. I just can't believe my husband never took me here. I didn't know you were married. I'm... not. I used to be. Hello. Oh, Kai, This is my good friend Michael. -How's it going, Michael? -Good. Nice to meet you, Kai. Hope I'm not in the way. No, no, of course not. Do you model as well? Maybe I could get a couple shots-- No. I'm just here as an assistant. Okay. Well, nice to meet you. -Thanks for helping out. -No problem. So, Mary, we don't have a lot of time. The idea is to get the shots as the sun's setting. -That's nice. -Yeah. So let's see what wardrobe you brought with you. So you said dresses. These are all the dresses I have. -Let's do this one. -Okay. Where should I change? Ah. Sorry, I didn't think about that. You guys just turn around. So, you been doing photography long? Few years. Yeah. Nice. -Oh, Mary, did I mention-- -Hey, I'm not done yet. Sorry. As foolish as it sounds, I wasn't thinking. -Okay. -You're all done? Yeah, wait. I'm just kidding. What-- what do you want to do about makeup? Everything's fine. Perfect. Are you sure you don't want me to put a little bit on? Are we putting confetti on the tree? No. It's perfect just the way it is. I'm beginning to think that all photographers are a bunch of smart asses. It's true. You're beautiful. Okay, let's take a couple of practice shots so when the time comes, we'll be ready. Okay. Where do you want me? Well, you'd look great anywhere. -Ha ha. -But... let's get you... ♪ [clicks tongue] All right, you got everything you need? Yeah. Thanks again for today. Anytime. Was happy to do it. Look, you're my responsibility now. -I gotta look out for you. -[chuckles] Wait, you were gonna finish telling me about that girl -you were seeing. -[scoffs] We met online. [laughs] -That's fun. [laughs] -Yeah, sure. -Does she live around here? -No, in Huntsville. -Well, that's not too bad. -Yeah. Thinking about going up to see her soon. Mike, you should. That'd be really good for you. Yeah.

Okay. -Okay. Let's go. -[laughs] Okay. -[engine starts] [ominous music playing] [thud] [Nicole] So, did he say when the pictures would be ready? -I didn't ask. -Girl, you should have asked. These photographers sometimes like to hold the photos hostage. I don't think he will. -Why are you so sure? -I think he likes me. Really. Is he cute? -Hello? [chuckles] -I don't know. Yes, you do. He's nice. When will I meet him? Oh. I gotta go. I'll call you back. Well, look who it is. -The usual? -Please. ♪ So, how'd the photos turn out? Oh, you did fantastic. Definitely some of my best work. -Really? -Without a doubt. Well, when can I see 'em? When you have lunch with me. [both chuckle] Nicole told me that you'd keep those photos hostage. -Who? -Oh, she's just a friend. Well tell Nicole she was right. I will not release your photos -until you have lunch with me. -[scoffs] It's just lunch. I can understand you hesitating if I said dinner, but not for lunch. You know what? I'll even pay. [both laugh] [sighs] Few more steps. And... What are we doing here? We're fishing. [chuckles] Fishing? You don't like fishing? No, I-- I-- I-- I do, I just, it-- it's not what I was expecting.

He's so kind. And sweet. But I don't-- I don't know, I'm-- I'm not ready for anything serious, so... I like hanging out with him, but... I don't know. Well, maybe you should tell him. I think he's getting pretty serious with you. Nic, you've met him one time. Yeah, but when I asked him how long he planned on being here, -he looked at you. -So? So? That depends on what's going on with y'all. Well, he knows about Trey. Yeah, but does he know you're not looking for anything serious? You have been spending a lot of time with him.

I didn't think you were real. Not at the bar. That was just the first time you noticed me. [sobbing continues] Your smile captivated me. Then... all of a sudden... [Mary whimpering] I tried. To be patient. To wait for you. So I waited. And waited. -To give you what you deserve. -[sobbing] But you just wouldn't figure it out. He didn't love you, not like me. It's been almost a year and you're still hung up on him. I thought getting rid of him would make things easier, but-- [Mary exclaims] Shh. -[thud] -[exclaims] [thudding] -I killed him. -[sobbing] I didn't want to do it. But no matter how many times he left you here, you still waited for him. Finally, we were getting close. And you bring this clown, Michael, to our shoot. Like, what the hell was that about, Mary? Our first date and you do that? [Mary sobbing intensely] I had to get rid of him too. [thud] [suspenseful music plays] [thudding] [Mary sobbing] I've been in love with you for too long.

Are you gonna be nice? Don't scream. Do you understand? I love you too, Kai. [sobbing] I love you too. Just let me say goodbye. You want to look at his picture and sniff his shirt? Yeah. Yes, just let me say goodbye. Mary, I left my bag. I see Kai's in there with you. Mary. Hey, girl. We're just a little busy. Can I get it to you later? I'll get it tomorrow. Don't hurt her, Kai. I...

Do you think maybe we could, uh... sit in the living room for a little while? We really haven't said much to each other. Might be kinda nice to... To visit. Okay? [water stops] Mary, I know you're grown up. And you don't need a... lecture from your old man but there's... And I would like to share some feelings with you if... if that's okay. There's just not that many people who could go through what you've been through and find their way again. And I say that because... I know when we lost your mother, I didn't f-- find my way. And I still haven't really. But there's something special about you. We lost your mother and... and you lost Trey and... and now... And somehow... you're strong. You definitely got that from your mother. I can only imagine the pain you're in right now. And... I don't want you to let that... that sick animal ruin the rest of your life. Take your time. All the time you need. And you will find your way. You always do. Everything's gonna be okay. I promise. [Mary and Nicole laughing] No, no. Do you remember that time when I spent the night at your house and then we prank called Steven? -Oh, my gosh, Steven. -[Nicole laughing] Oh, God, I haven't thought about him in a long time. -I wonder what he's up to. -I don't know.
