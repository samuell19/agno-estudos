Pete is pulling down $ 1 50k a year all because some alum got a little play on the KOK-tail cruise. Then there's the story of the '88 KOK-tail cruise. Those boys decided to -- to skimp on the party. Homemade wine coolers... . . .a homeless stripper. . . . . .soft-core porn . Needless to say, the boys of '88 are still paying off their student loans. l have no regrets. That is why l've called this meeting . This year's cruise is in grave danger. 'Cause you'll be there? [ Laughter ] Will the social committee please rise? [ Clears throat ] [ Chairs squeaking ] Gentlemen , the brothers standing before you have embezzled all of your parents' hard-earned money. [ Chuckles ] Yeah , very funny, Spencer.

Well , what the fuck are we gonna do now? -- Don't worry about it. l'll figure it out. -- Figure it out. Just let me deal with my father first, and then l'll get us back in the house, okay? -- [ lndistinct talking ] -- Jesus, Dave. You look like a mess. Oh . . .well , you know life at the house. l remember. Things get pretty crazy, huh? Yeah , crazy. [ Chuckles ] Good news, son . John Kloss, class of '54, is coming to the KOK-tail cruise. l've set up an interview for you . Oh , that's great.

Oh , thanks for dragging me down with you . We just need to prove that Spence stole the money. Well , although l hardly feel like this is the appropriate time to bring it up, what about the videotape, man? What videotape? The videotape of Adam humping the Tri Pis, man . Hmm? Doofer, what are you saying? Well, l'd just finished studying for some school when l noticed Adam's speaker was tipped over. On the floor was a little video camera rigged to a motion detector. [ Slurring ] l found a thing . l noticed that its input cable had come loose, so l carefully traced it to its source. l got a thing . [ Groans ] lt led to a metal footlocker at the bottom of Adam's closet, which was, you know, already unlocked. [ Grunting ] lnside, l found a videocassette recorder. Well, naturally, since it was his private property, l didn't touch anything. [ Groaning, panting ] You could see the safe right by his bed . You were watching my tape? [ Squeaky voice ] No. [ Panting, moaning continue ] -- You're a pervert! You're a pervert! You're a pervert! -- [ Grunting ] No, no. Hey, hey, hey. Come on . Come on . This is great. Look, Spence is gonna be on videotape. Look, we need to sneak back into the house, get the tape, and we're back in K. O.K., all right? Well , how do we get in , Dave? Tonight's the ''all trim'' party, and the only thing walking through that door is tits. [ All breathing heavily ] l got a plan .

[ Chuckles ] Daisy, l think you deserve better than that. l mean , the only way you're ever gonna be happy is if you're true to what you want.

Listen , l know you can never trust me after what l did , but l'm glad it happened . What? Under normal circumstances, we never would have gotten to know each other. l mean , let's face it -- you had me pigeonholed as a certain kind of person , and the same was true about me. So that's why l'm glad it happened, 'cause you're a person l can talk to. l wasn't afraid to tell you things l never talked about with anyone. Like when you lost your virginity to the bass player who had huge balls, right? Yeah , actually, that -- that happened to my cousin Maggie. Look, you don't have to forgive me. l just -- l just wanted you to know that meeting you changed my life. [ Voice breaking ] Changed whose life? The sweet girl from Minnesota?
