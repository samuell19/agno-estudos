(slow majestic music) - [Woman] Someone, please. - Get out of here. - Yeah, get out of here. - Oh! (dramatic orchestral music) - Come. With me. Inside. Out of the heat. (soldiers laughing) I'd nearly given up hope. - Do you have water? - For you. (majestic music) Got it. You're fortunate I saw you. They'd have killed you. - Huh. - I'm Prelate of Yamatar. The holy crests on your sword. The first I've seen in many years. Your relief column. Is it close behind you? - I am alone. - You are a holy warrior? A Homerac? - The world we knew is dead. Prelate. - Where are you going? - Have a little look. What gives them the right to hold the well? - Hired rabble. They'd kill for a drop of water. - Who pays them? - Who? Zeg, the tyrant, that's who. That's his compound there. His enemy, Bal Caz, there. Each of these scum pits his hired soldiers against the other for control of the well. It's the poor villagers caught in between who suffer. - Which is the stronger of the two? - Each in his own way is as strong as the other. Why do you ask? (dramatic music) (soldier chuckling) - Ah. - Tell your master, Bal Caz, to watch the well. And tell him I don't work cheap. - [Guard] Master Bal Caz! - Look who's here. - Yeah. What do you want? - Little drink of water. - If you want water, go dig for it like everyone else. - Nah. I never was much for digging. - I'm gonna cut you in half. (villagers cheering) - We villagers thank you, dark one! (villagers yelling and laughing) - Dark one? Master Bal Caz bids you bless of his invitation. (fools laughing manically) (villagers whooping) - Retake the well! We'll have to deal differently with this new sword of Bal Caz. - I'm onto it. (metal clanging) (whip cracking) - Your Worship. The fountain of love. (fools laughing) Thank you, Master Bal Caz. Thank you. Thank you, Master. - Ah, yes. You will fight for Bal Caz? - I fight for gold and tarac. - I will pay two taracs. And give you the shelter of my house till you die. - Not enough. (creature growling) - I will give you 25 taracs for every eight settings of the sun. (chuckling) Hm. - 100. (Bal Caz grumbling) In advance. - Robbery! Tomorrow you will lead my warriors against Zeg, and rid Yamatar of that miserable scum who denies me water. Go, enjoy the comforts of Bal Caz. I attack at first light. - Hm. - Are you sure this is a good plan? (creature growling) I see. The dark one will kill Zeg, and we will kill the dark one, and I will get my 100 taracs back. Very clever, darling. What would I do without you? Captain! Send that pirate Zeg my challenge! (suspenseful music) - Bring me the sacred sword! I want the princess here for the test. I should kill you for this! You've got one more chance to make me the sacred Sword of Ura. Or I'll sell you to the slavers, and your blessed father's head will rest on my pike! - My lord. Bal Caz has sent a challenge. - So the pig takes courage from one dark warrior. This fight won't last long, alert the troops. - I warrant you, my lord. The dark one will end his service upon my sword. - Good, very good. Put her in chains! (horn sounding) (dramatic music) (soldiers shouting) - Thief! Scum! Today is your last. You pirate! - We shall see, you great worm! - Dark one. Attack. - I won't fight for anyone that plots against my life. - Ha ha. - Warriors! Attack! - Zeg! Zeg! Zeg! Zeg! - Do it! Attack! - Attack! - The slavers! The slavers! Slavers! - I'll kill you later. - We'll see who kills who, my fat friend. Truce? - Truce. (Bal Caz yelling) (gong chiming) (drum beating) - See there? The big ugly one? That's Burgo. Master slaver. And the meanest of the lot. You know him? - I've seen him before. When you see Burgo, you know another village has fallen. (Burgo yelling) - All right! Bring the slaves! This sword's too light. - Yes. But quicker the cut. - And now, my taracs. - Half a slave's weight. - And a fat one at that, huh? Master Bal Caz. (creature growling) - Indeed. Have you water enough for the great waste? - [Burgo] I do. Thanks to Master Zeg. - Then good crossing, Master Burgo. And good night to you, Master Zeg. - Good night to you, Master Bal Caz, sleep well. Master Burgo, you have my trade. Good slaves for good armament. - Ah. Will you take this for the female? - No. She pleases me. For the moment. - Ah. - When Burgo discovers Zeg's coat of arms on the poison water, the slavers will return with a force large enough to rid me of Zeg forever. (laughing) (men coughing and groaning) - Poisoned. Zeg's doing! I will avenge you. My warriors! Gather a new army, and return to avenge your deaths! (laughing manically) (gasping) (suspenseful music) - I came to sell information. - Of what sort? - Well. I heard something about Bal Caz and your coat of arms. - My coat of arms? Go on, speak. - Bal Caz has given Burgo gourds of poison water with your coat of arms on them. When Burgo sees his warriors dead, he's going to be very angry. - [Zeg] How do you know this? - I make it my business. - Get me those gourds. - Too dangerous. - Guards! Move! (Naja groaning) (guards talking outside) - Homerac. Take the Prelate. And escape this night from Yamatar. Your secret is safe with me. (dramatic music) There was a time when I could command. - And I would obey. But that is finished. - Is it? - Yes. - You must save the Prelate. I can no longer keep him from harm. - Zeg, does he know? - He wants the Sword of Ura. - You can do that? - He will never have it. (heroic orchestral music) - Hide in the temple with the Prelate. I'll join you later. (creature growling) - You come at a most opportune moment, dark one. What do you want for that creature? - 1,000 taracs. - Done. Take it away. How is it you came to be in possession of Bal Caz's favors? - I was never one to let opportunity pass me by. - Bal Caz's head will be before me soon enough. Events move swiftly, it will not pay to stand alone. - Or to choose the wrong side. (soldiers chanting rhythmically) - So, you miserable sleaze. You thought you could beat me. (creature growling) Bal Caz. Leave the village, or I'll kill this vermin where he stands. - Stop! - So? Decide, Bal Caz. - We will see who will stay and who will go. (soldiers laughing) Stop! - Stop! We'll trade. - So be it. Let the trade begin. (creature growling) - Oh. How did you know? - Another time. - Find the old fool. - First ten, follow! Hyah! Search everywhere. Find him! (dramatic piano music) - Captain. Nothing. - Captain. We've looked. We've found no one. - Search the village. A ransom. One gourd of water. (water dripping) - Do I hear water? - [Prelate] Hm. - Where does this passage lead? - [Prelate] It connects with the well. - That oughta cause some excitement. Now, if they lower a man down there, they'll think the well has gone dry, won't they? And now, I must offer my sword to Zeg. You stay here and make sure my taracs are safe. (suspenseful music) (men shouting) - What brings you to my hall, warrior? - The ring of taracs. - Perhaps he seeks sanctuary. - Have you something more to sell? - Yes, Master Zeg. My sword. - That would be welcome. Sit beside me and we'll speak. I weary of this sword play, give me something amusing. (woman screaming) Tell me, dark one, would Bal Caz pay you well? - He did. - Why choose this house? You are its enemy. - A good question, how do you answer? - I fight for those who pay me the most. Bal Caz thinks you are betrayed from within. So that gives him courage. With my sword against him, he will be frightened. My worth is greater here, if you should pay. - Should she live? - You are the master. - Yes. - Beware, my lord. He serves his own end, and could turn against you if the pay were greater. - No doubt as all here would, if they had the choice. Would you not welcome his sword against Bal Caz? How ironic. This village dies for lack of water. This lovely creature dies of an overabundance. Stimulating, you agree? - There are no lessons in death, my lord. Only victory and defeat. As for my part, I prefer 400 taracs. - You do not count them? - I trust Master Zeg. - You've brought me good cheer, will you fill yourself? - First I think I must inspect your defenses. I could not eat while feeling I was in peril of my life. - As captain of the guard, he does me insult, my lord. - See to his needs. - Good night, my lord. Is hostage woman pretty well guarded? - Yeah. - Where's she kept? - This way. She's in there. Guarded by the protector. I wouldn't go in there. It's an awful sort of thing. - Have you seen it? - No, I haven't. - Then how do you know she's safe? - Stay back! - She's escaped! Get the guard! - Guards! Guards! - [Naja] Hurry. (protector growling) Please. - The Prelate waits for you beneath the temple. Go there and hide with him. Show yourself to no one. (screaming) (dramatic music) (protector grunting) - What is this news? - See for yourself, Master Zeg. - Impossible. How could this have happened? - It would take 20 men to do a thing like this. - Search the village! Leave nothing unturned, or I'll have all your heads! (rousing music) Move! Move! (soldiers yelling) - Naja. Naja. Quickly. Quickly, we must hide. - You're the sword that led the dark one from this hall. - Yes. - Before you sounded the alarm, did you see the woman gone yourself? - Oh. - Master Zeg. Master Zeg. The dark one killed the protector, and I have proof. I spoke with the guard. (men laughing and carousing) - Hyah! (men laughing) - Hey! In honor of my new sword, I've ordered special entertainment. (exotic percussive music) (groaning) - Where is the woman? Where? - [Man] Kief! - What? - [Man] Come in! - What? - [Man] In here! (groaning) - To be before Master Zeg, where are the guards? Have them form a circle around the well. - [Man] The well is drying up. - Seen this yourself? Hey, you! Inform Master Zeg the well's going dry. Go! Gather the troops. Full armaments, swords and shields. Move! He's escaped! Find the dark one! Move! Find the dark one! Find him! Move! Over here! Give me a torch! - He must be here. - Over here, you fool! The dark one's escaped. - [Zeg] Forget about that, we've got to protect the well. - [Kief] I want him. Search everywhere. He must be here! - [Man] Open the gate! Move the wagons! Move the wagon out! - Hold there! Hold! - Kief! Reinforce the well! Move the wagon out! - Yes, my lord. Move! (soldiers chanting rhythmically) (groaning) - It's drying up. This is all we could draw. - [Soldiers] Water! Water! - Quiet! No one'll die. Lower a man to check the well. - Get a rope over here. You, in the well. Look, my lord. (men shouting) - Arm shields. - Shields! - And what manner of mischief is this? - Stand back, vulture. - It's almost dry. - Curb, you fool! - [Soldiers] Water! We must have water! - Quiet! There's water? - See for yourself. - Take the well or die! (soldiers yelling) (dramatic music) Ah! Stop! Choose, Master Zeg. The villagers seek our deaths! We need each other! - Better, an alliance. - Alliance! Join forces! - Surround the well. - Yes. Ah! - Warriors of Yamatar! I am master here now. Are you with me against our enemies? (soldiers cheering) - Thou sacred Sword of Ura, forged from our blood, aid our village in this dark hour. (dramatic choral music) (rhythmic percussion) (villagers shouting) (rhythmic percussion and chanting) (villagers yelling) (Burgo laughing) - Mighty Burgo. Thank you. This dry well has caused us grief enough. - Thank you, he says. (laughing) Disarm them! - What are you doing? I thought you were my friend! - Friend? Slavers have no friends. (laughing) (romantic music) - Pick it up. - It's too light. - Strike the anvil. Strike it. In your hand is the Sword of Ura. Let them see it. (villagers cheering) (villagers screaming) (whips cracking) (Burgo laughing) - A surprise, master. - (laughing) Put him with the others. - Water has been drained off. Beneath the temple. We repaired the break with stones. It will flow by tonight. - Your men made a fool of Zeg. We leave this night. Load the booty and make ready the slaves. Kill the weak ones. - Yes, master. Master! Look! (dramatic music) - Put him with the rest! You are a Homerac. Put down your sword. Your gods are dead. - Prove it. (Burgo chuckling) - Kill him! - Now is the time! Death to the slavers! - Prelate. - The gods are with us, Naja. - You're free. - Get the Homerac! Yah! - I travel alone. - All of Yamatar is with you. - And I'm with all of you. - To holy victory. Homerac. - To holy victory. - [Naja] Come back to us. (stirring heroic music)
