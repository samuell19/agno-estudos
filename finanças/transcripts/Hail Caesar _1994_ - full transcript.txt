Now this next song is one of our hometown favorites and I'd love to dedicate it to me mum. - Hey bonehead, get off the stage! Sound check ended over an hour ago. - Fooled you, didn't I? I'm Julius, Julius Caesar. I know what you're thinkin'. You're out there sayin' no way, can't be. Well, it's true. My parents, may God rest their souls, were archaeologists, big Roman history buffs, and that's the name they gave me. Julius Caeser Magruder. Look, if you wanna make it big in the music business, which you may rest assured I will do, you gotta have the name. Even so, it was no picnic being a kid named after a dead emperor, but that's another story. Now, how did a guy like me, talented but unknown, find himself pounding on the doorway of mega stardom? I owe it all to her: Venus, the Roman goddess of love. But let's start back at the beginning when I was just another struggling young rocker. (heavy rock music) This is the crib, the palace so to speak.

What do they want? - I don't know, must be my grades. - I didn't know you went to college. - Ha. We regret to inform you that you no longer meet our eligibility requirements. I don't? - Four F's and an incomplete. Very impressive, Julius. - Oh man. Okay, you know what this means, don't ya? From now on, total focus on the music. Okay? Can we make a pact here? - Sure! - Huh, can we join hands? - Sure, baby! - Julius, let's go inside. - No, this is the defining moment, okay? Now let's all repeat: I realize now. - [Wlad And Annie] I realize now. - [Julius] All I have is my music. - [Wlad And Annie] All I have is my music. - Nowhere to hide. - [Wlad And Annie] Nowhere to hide. - Nothing to fall back on. - [Wlad And Annie] Nothing to fall back on. - Nothing except aspirin and her rich daddy. - Buffer, I told you her name is Buffer. - Buffer, aspirin, whatever. She still gives me a headache. - Buffer, oh my. I was supposed to pick her up an hour ago. She's gonna kill me. - Hey, what about the band? What about your defining moment? We need to practice. We suck. - We don't suck. We're good! Right, Wlad? - What is suck? I have a hunger now. I go make the pierogies, okay? (electric guitar music) - Annie, look. It's all rock 'n roll, okay? We'll deal with it tomorrow. We'll practice tomorrow, don't worry about it. It'll be fine. God, I'm really late. (playful plodding music) - Look at this headline: World Peace Summit Scheduled. Ha! What a crock. It's all just a plot to drive honest arms manufacturers like me out of business. - Sir, I'm sure we have nothing to worry about on the world peace front, but if I could call your attention to a problem at the plant? - Why do you keep bugging me about all these little details, Larry? What the hell am I paying you for? - Mr. Bidwell, the environmentalists are picketing the plant. - So what? You're scared of a bunch of sniveling tree huggers? Turn the fire hoses on 'em. - I don't think that would be good publicity for us right now, sir. Remember Big Pink. (ominous music) - Big Pink. Nothing must jeopardize Big Pink. Nothing, you understand me? (engine rumbling) Oh God, not him. - Mr. Bidwell? - Just what I need, Buffer's numbnuts boyfriend. I swear she's seeing him just to piss me off. (playful plodding music) God, I hope she's not sleeping with him. (metal banging) - Hey, Mr. Bidwell! I can't believe it, not even a scratch. I'm really sorry about your car, sir. - I need a drink. (light flute music) - Please send me the bill. (doorbell rings) (butler grunts) Hi there. Is Buffer, uh... - [Butler] Eh, kids all here. - Not bad and you?

(Wlad laughs) - Look Annie, do me a favor. Will you take your medication? We'll practice tomorrow. - Yeah, and then tomorrow it'll be the next day. Look, this band means everything to me. I've been put in jail for this band. - Annie, you were put in jail for stealing a UPS truck. Now, come on. - Well yeah. That was so we could haul our gear to that gig. What have you done? - Me, how can you ask me that? I'm the front man. - Oh God. Besides shakin' your skinny ass, Julius, you're a joke. If you're the front man why don't you act like one and be a leader. Stop selling out. - I'm not selling out! - You say this band is your life and then you blow it off. And for what, huh? A party? - It's very important to Buffer. - What about what's important to you? - She's important to me. - Well ya can't always have it both ways. One of these days you're gonna have to stand up for what you believe in. - I will. I do. (bluesy electric guitar music) And I'm not a sellout. Nice suit. (doorbell rings) (butler grunts) How ya doin'? (playful plodding music) - [Butler] Why can't this kid get a job? (light music) (party goers chattering) - Julius. How the hell are ya, ya old gravy boat. - Mr. Remora. Have you seen Buffer? - I'm sure she's around here somewhere. How 'bout a drink? What's your poison? - I don't know, beer I guess. - Beer. (chuckles) Well that's no way to get in the spirit of things now is it? Charlie, a martini. You'll love it. (speaking in foreign language) (Julius sputters) (Julius coughing) Allow me. (Julius coughing) No, keep it, please. My gift to you. (chuckles) By the way, Mr. Bidwell has asked to speak with you, if you have a moment. (Mr. Bidwell exhales) - [Julius] Great party, Mr. Bidwell. - Ya know what, numbnuts? - [Julius] What, sir? - I don't like you. I've never liked you and I'm never gonna like you. - That's funny, sir. (chuckles) - Okay, kid. I'll get right to the point. (gun clicks) I will give you $50,000 if you will stay away from my daughter for the rest of your natural born life. (cartridge clicks) - $50,000? (gun clicks) - 75,000. - What? - $100,000 and that's my final offer. - You're serious? - Well of course I'm serious, numbnuts! - Oh, I get it. You're just testing me to see how much love I have for your daughter. Okay. (chuckles) Let me just tell ya somethin', Mr. Bidwell. Julius Caesar does not sell out. Now I love Buffer and I will do anything for Buffer. If you're gonna deprive me of that right, you may as well kill me. I'm dead. (gun fires) (glass breaking) Kidding, kidding. (laughs) Kidding, sir. Can we talk about this? - I used to be like you. What am I saying? I was never like you, but I was poor. I was uneducated and through hard work I pulled myself up by my bootstraps and look what I made of myself. President of a multi-national corporation and one of the biggest producers of pencil erasers in the entire Western Hemisphere. Buffer's all I have. If she stays with you, my hard work goes for nothing. You'll blow everything. My daughter needs a man to carry on my work. A strong man, a man of vision, a man of destiny. - I am that man, sir. - Don't make me barf. Look at yourself. You've got no education, got no job. What are your plans for the future? - Well I was kind of thinking Buffer would support me at least 'til the band took off. - Get out of my house, you're staining my carpet. I'll have a check cut for $100,000. - Wait, there's gotta be some way I can prove myself to you. What have you got to lose? - My patience for one thing. - No, listen to me. I can make you proud of me. (suspenseful music) I can do it. If I can't, I'll disappear. I'll bet you anything. - Bet? You say bet? - I'll bet you anything you want. - Well, well, well, seems I'm a sportin' man, junior. Tell ya what I'm gonna do. If you can come up with $100,000 within six months, you can have my daughter with my blessing. If you fail you have to stay away for the rest of your life and I'll squash you. What do ya say, Julius? How bad do you want it? - Hundred grand in six months. That comes to, uh... - That's $4,666.66 a week, son. - Where am I gonna get that kind of money? - Tell ya what. I'm feeling generous. I'll even give you a job. - You'll what? - Eh, one of my plants. The work is hard, but if you're the new man you say you are, I'm sure you'll be up to it. (tense music) (men laughing) - The day Daddy bought me the Porsche I wrecked it and he had to buy me another one. (group laughing) Oh Julius, I want you to meet Grayden, Boyden, and Cyan. They're members of Daddy's club. Guys, this is Julius. - Nice to meet you guys. - So what were we talking about? - Buffer, can I talk to you for a second, please? (party goers chattering) - Not now, Julius. You're being rude. (chuckles) - It's important. - Not more important than the club. (group laughs) I invited you to this party so that you could meet the right kind of people. You are blowing it big time. - Please? - No. - Any of you guys drive a black BMW? Because I just saw the valet outside on the front lawn doin' donuts. You might wanna check that out. - Real cute, Julius. - Don't get mad when I tell ya what I'm about to tell ya. - I'm already mad at you. - I just made a bet with your dad. - You should know better than to bet with Daddy. He never loses. What did you bet? - You. If I don't come up with $100,000 in the next six months, I can never see you again for the rest of my natural born life. - You're fighting over me? (Buffer laughs) This is exciting. (laughs) - Have you lost your mind, sir? - Hey, take a pill, Larry. - But you've hired that, (speaking in foreign language), hoodlum at our most critical plant. - Whose plant? - I'm sorry, did I say our plant? Your plant. Your plant. - Don't you ever forget it. - Yes, sir. But if I may, this is a very, this is a very sensitive time at the plant. Think of Big Pink. With all the protestors, government inspections, I'm spending all my time there as it is. - Exactly, so you can keep an eye on him. You can make sure he doesn't get into any trouble. - Yes sir, but-- - You can have some fun with him, but don't let him quit. As long as he's on the assembly line earning $7 an hour, I don't have to worry about my bet. (romantic orchestral music) - [Julius] Now I know what you're thinking. Caesar, you're a fool. Shoulda taken the 100 grand. But give Caesar his due. I was young and in love and there was no way I was gonna sell out, so I accepted the terms of Bidwell's cold-blooded challenge and hurled myself fearlessly into the uncharted world of capitalism. - [Protestors] Save our Earth! Save this place! Close down Bidwell's, don't erase! Save our Earth! Save this place! Close down Bidwell's, don't erase! - You can't! - Scab! - [Protestors] Close down Bidwell's, don't erase! Save our Earth! Save this place! Close down! (Pete laughing) - You mean you've never worked in an eraser factory before? - No, sir. But, um, it really stinks. - Stinks? - Not the job, sir, the smell? Has a certain aroma. - (sniffs) Oh yeah. (sniffs) - No offense. - No, no, no, no, no, no. No offense, no offense. Now you'll get used to it. Look at me, I've been here for 20 years. 20 years, I've been here 20 years. Ya know how long I've been here? - 20 years. - How'd you know? (Julius laughs) 20 years. Ya know rubber must be running all through my veins. That's right, I'm sure of it 'cause no matter what knocks me down I just bounce right back. Scarlet, frankly my dear-- (Larry clears his throat) - Come on, do it. Hurry it up, time is money. - Sorry, Mr. Remora. All right, Julian, why don't ya take these forms and fill 'em out and you can get started. (suspenseful music) - Thank you, sir. Do you have a pen? (Pete gasps) - We only use pencils around here. (laughs) (men laughing) (machinery whirring) (Larry whistling) - Boys, (claps) boys. Can I have your attention, please? We have a new man joining our little work release program here today. - Loser alert. - Yeah. - Julius, say hello to the boys. - Hi, boys. (ominous music) - Julius is a very close friend of Mr. Bidwell's. Mr. Bidwell says he should have a job here. Does everybody understand that? Any questions? - (spits) Where the hell's he gonna work? - Here with you. Is that a problem? - We don't have any openings on this line. Let him go work somewhere else. - That reminds me, is there a Nick here? - Yeah, why? (sultry music) - You've been transferred to the melting pit. - There's toxic fumes in that pit. Let your loser friend go work there. We need Nicky right here. - Nonsense, Julius can handle it, thank you very much. (sultry music) Hm, well. There ya have it. Break's over, back to work. (upbeat guitar music) Excuse me, excuse me, hi. - What's up? - You wanna know somethin'? I'm gonna kick your ass. (rock music thumping) - What? - I said, I'm gonna kick your ass. - Oh, you wouldn't know 'em. They're not country. - I said I'm gonna kick your ass. - Lunch? - I'm gonna kill you! - I thought you were gonna kick my ass? - What? (playful orchestral music) - Ooh, ooh. Doh. - So, you wanna play games, huh? - Oh no, guys, I was just kiddin'. - Yeah. - It was a joke. I was kidding, I was kidding, the whole time I was kidding. Joking, joker, he's a joker. (laughs) - First I'm gonna kick his ass then I'm gonna kill him. - No guys, no, no. Look, I was kidding. No please, I'm dizzy now. No, stop. - Sorry, you wanted to play games, right? - No, so no games. No games, guys, no please. - You wanted to play games? - [Julius] No, no, no games. Now put me down, stop! - Play games now. - [Julius] Please, no, no, no more! (somber music) - That's it! I quit! I coulda been a doctor, but no, I had to take drugs in college. No, my mom was right. I don't need this crap. Lose the dog or get a post office box. Ya got that? Ya got that? - Oh wow, what happened to you? - Some of my fellow employees decided to beat the crap outta me today. - Employees? Where are you working, the World Wrestling Federation? - No, Mr. Bidwell's eraser factory. - So that's where you've been all day. Why would you wanna work there? - Look, I made this very stupid bet with Mr. Bidwell. He says that if I can make him $100,000 in six months, I can have Buffer. - You made a bet for a person? - Look, not exactly, Annie. - That has gotta be the most offensive, sexist, disgusting thing I have ever heard. Does Asprin know about this? - Look, her name is Buffer, okay? And actually, she liked the idea. Now if you don't mind, I'm gonna go inside and take a shower. Goodnight. - No, you can't take a shower. We gotta practice, you promised. - I can't take a shower? - No. (soft jazz music) - Look Annie, we'll practice later, okay. Take your medication. Goodbye. - Julius. Hello? (Pete huffs) - Go home, Dewitt, please. I told you, there's nothing to worry about. - Maybe so. But those new erasers you've been making, I've done some testing and they're not erasers. They are plastic explosives. - (laughs) Nonsense, you don't know what you're talkin' about, Dewitt, please. - Right. And then I happened to see some orders in the computer and discovered this Big Pink. You know what's in that file? - No, what's in the Big Pink file, Mr. Dewitt? - I don't know because I couldn't get into it. That's because it was encoded, because it was password protected, because, because it was closed up tighter than two coats of paint. - Well, I'll have someone look into that right away. Gee, wow. Excellent work there, Dewitt. Good work. - But that's not good enough, Larry! I am the manager here! I need to know! What the hell is goin' on around here? Now you better level with me and come clean! Or I'm gonna have to call Bidwell. (suspenseful music) - Did you say Big Pink? - I said Big Pink. - I'm sorry, I thought you said big stink. We have no big stink. I'm so stupid, wow. You know, I have that data right here as a matter of fact. It's here somewhere. What do ya know, here it is. Wow, well have a look for yourself. - What? It's nothing. What? - Are you blind? Look closer. Getting old, Dewitt? - I'm telling you that (grunts). - You were right. You had to do it. He was getting too close. What are we gonna tell his wife? - No, don't tell her anything. I wonder if she knew he started drinking again? (ominous music) - If Dewitt figured out what we're up to, how can we be sure the next guy won't? - I've got it all figured out. I've got the perfect candidate. (Mr. Bidwell laughing) - Come on, guys, why are we fighting? I mean, we're all on the same side, right? - 'Cause you're an idiot. - Our jobs are hard. Our backs are bent, but is our spirit broken? I say no. I say we can do better. Why should would we work under these conditions? Why such low pay? Why? Why? I say we form a union and demand fair wages, a safe workplace, adequate healthcare. (angelic music) We're not asking for a handout, just a shot at that dream, the American dream. So what do ya say? Are ya with me? - I say we kill the bastard! - [Men] Yeah! - Kill him, kill him. (men chattering) - Get him, get him! (men chattering) - Oh, want a piece of me, huh? (men shouting) Say hello to my little friend. (extinguisher whooshes) You wanted to see me, sir? - Julius. - Mr. Remora, I'm so sorry about what happened on the floor. I really didn't mean that and I'm really sorry about what happened earlier. - Julius, calm down. Of course you were right to stand up to Dave and the boys. In fact, it just confirms for me the decision I've just made. - Huh? - You know, Julius, if America had more bright self-starters like yourself, the Filipinos wouldn't be kickin' our butts in the arena of eraser production. Get my drift? - I don't think so. - Julius, Mr. Dewitt has disappeared. - Disappeared? - Well, we've known for quite some time he's had some problems. We've tried to help and unfortunately we've done everything we can do. - Well that's so sad. He seemed like such a nice guy. - Yeah, I know. But it doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for what I have to say. Julius, you are the new plant manager. And as of now, this is your office. - You mean I'm not fired? - Fired? (laughs) Au contraire, Pierre. Let me ask ya somethin', Julius. How do you think I've gotten to where I am? - By kissin' Mr. Bidwell's-- - By spotting talented management potential, and nurturing that potential. Let's face it, Julius, if you look good, I look good. - Isn't that like a shampoo commercial? - (chuckles) So what do ya say, you accept the job? You'll get a handsome raise and I know you have that bet with Mr. Bidwell going on. - How much would I make? - (scoffs) Not enough, but it will be a good base. And who knows, with a little effort you could have my job in no time. - Oh no, Mr. Remora, I could never fill your shoes. - (chuckles) True. So what do ya say, Julius, hm? You accept the job? I mean, don't let me pressure you. Just say the word and I'll put you back to work on the floor with your friends. - I don't know what to say. - Say you're in. - All right, I'm in. - All right! (laughs) (upbeat music) - That butt kissing tapeworm. Daddy, what is he up to now? - I beg your pardon? - Remora. He just made Julius the plant manager? Now is that because of Julius's excellent organizational skills, or is it his vision for the future of the eraser industry? - Now Buffer, I'm sure Mr. Remora knows exactly what he's doing. After all, he didn't get to be my right-hand man by making a lot of bad business decisions, did he? - No. - Well then. - He got there by lying, stabbing people in the back, and kissing your butt. - Well that's true, but you must be happy. I mean Julius is showing a lot of potential. - I know. But with him working all the time I don't have anything to do. I'm bored. - Well, how 'bout a game of squash? I just hired a new pro to help me work on my backhand. (doorbell rings) That must be him now. - I hate squash. I wanna go shopping. (sultry music) Buffer, this is Steve. - Hi. - (chuckles) Hi, nice to meet you. - You, too. Daddy, can I have a new squash racket? (giggles) - I'll notify his wife. - No thank you, Mr. Remora. Okay, there's nothin' else to see here. Let's get back to work. (machinery whirring) - We tried to help him. It's workers like that that give the eraser industry a bad name. Let that be a lesson to you, Julius. Well, back to work. (light orchestral music) - Now this is where it all started for me. The engine that drives the heart of America, the assembly line. - These are all my friends. There's Big Dave. What do ya say, Big Dave? - Come on, me and you in the parking lot, punk. - That's goin' on your file, Dave. He loves me, he's just kidding. Back to work. And this is the last stop on our tour, the brains of the operation, my office. Check it out, two phones, free long distance. - Free? - Yeah, I have speaker phone, too, but I haven't figured out how to use it yet, but. Oh and Wlad, look. Pencil, huh? With fresh Bidwell eraser, huh? Where do ya think I should put the hoop? - I don't know, Julius. Come on, Wlad, we gotta go. - Mama! Mama. (speaking in foreign language) Wlad! Wlad! AT&T! AT&T! - What's the matter? (speaking in foreign language) Is it the smell? - [Wlad] AT&T! - It'll go away. (speaking in foreign language) You get used to it. I hardly even notice it anymore, really. (chuckles) - [Wlad] America, America! - I think you're a phony. (speaking in foreign language) - I am not. - What do you know about running a company? (speaking in foreign language) - Look, I'm learning a lot right now, okay? My learning curve is very steep. (speaking in foreign language) - Come on, this is me. You don't have to try to impress me. What do you really do here? (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) - Tell ya the truth, I don't do anything. (speaking in foreign language) I'm not really runnin' this company. - No duh, Julius. Why do you think they gave you this job? Bidwell's no fool, he knows you don't know how to run a company. He's just trying to keep an eye on you to make sure you don't win that bet. (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you, Julius, thank you. - You're welcome, Wlad. (computer beeping) Hey, don't play with that. I don't even know how to use that thing. - [Annie] Julius, why don't you blow it off and come back to the house and play some music? Your dog misses you. - No way, okay? I'm gonna win that bet. If I could only get like three or four more jobs I'll be perfect. - Then I guess I shouldn't wait for you to come home and practice. - Annie, I can do this. Trust me. - No, I can't. - What? - You can't have it both ways. You say this band is important to you, but actions speak louder than words, ya know? - I can do both. - Yeah, okay Julius, if you say so. Come on, Wlad, we're outta here. - One moment, please. (computer beeping) - What'd ya do? You can get me in a lot of trouble with this thing, ya know. What is this? (computer beeps) - See, profit and loss statement. Cash flow, capital expenditures. Ya know, I'm thinking of investing in Bidwell's Industries. - Wlad, tell me something. What was it that ya did back in Russia? - I was worker in a cemetery. Workin' with stiffs. - Doing what? - Sales. - What else did ya do? - I was an accountant for a state beef factory. That's it. Now I came to America. Breathe fresh air of freedom, huh? Shave head, drive a custom as well, rock 'n roll all night, party every day. Freakin' good. - You mean you know how to run a factory? - Sure, a beef factory, yes. - Beef, erasers, what's the difference? Will you teach me? - You bet! - No, don't do it, Wlad. You'll lose your soul. - Please? - No. Come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) - Wait. I just got a great idea. What is that every band needs to be discovered? - Naked woman! - Besides naked woman, Wlad. We need to record a demo! - How are we gonna do that, Julius? - No listen. With the money I'm making here, we can record the demo. With the advance money from the record deal I can win the bet. What do ya say? Please? - Oh, quit lookin' at me with those little puppy dog eyes. You make me wanna puke. Okay, I don't think it's gonna work, but if it'll get ya to practice every day. (Julius grunting) - [Julius] Please, please, please. - We'll do it. - Ah!

It's not gonna hold water with me. Don't interrupt me when I'm telling you you're nothing. You are on the thinnest of possible ices, my friend. He what? All right, you tell Mr. Bono, Houston, to cool his jets or he and The Edge are nowhere near my house for Passover this year, ya got me? You can quote me on that. P.S. you are still the nobody! (phone receiver bangs) - So what do you think, Mort? - (chuckles) What do I think? I'll tell ya what I think. You want a beverage? You want a flavored water? We got vanilla cream, boison-strawberry, kiwi. - Um, plain is great. - Plain is good. And I can do plain. Miriam! Where's the plain water? Can not get good help these days. But I've got it. Where are you from? - Nowhere really. My parents were archaeologists, Roman history buffs. - What is your name? - Julius Caesar. (Mort laughs) Magruder. - Magruder. What is that? That's Greek, uh, German, Spanish? - Irish. - Irish, oh. Isn't that the best? What, north or south? I'm kidding, that's touchy, that's touchy. Julius, can I call you Julius? - Sure. - Magruder, Magruder, Magruder, Magruder! I can't believe what I'm seeing here. - What are ya seein', Mort? - You. Do you have any idea what it's like to sit in this chair day after day, night after night, morning after morning trying desperately to be a creative catalyst in a town brimming with neurotic no talent nitwits! (exhales) And then you come in here with that music and that hair. What color is that, baby? - Mello Yello. - (chuckles) Exactly. - Exactly. (chuckles) (Mort chanting) - Are you feeling what I'm feeling? - I feel like I'm feelin' it, Mort. - You sensing what I'm sensing? - I'm getting a sense. - I am seeing things. I'm gonna tell ya what I'm seeing. I'm seeing nine things. Okay? One, this is big. Two, I'm excited. Three, five to seven record deal with points across the board. Four, live theater, TV, movies, mall appearances. Five, more mall appearances. Six through eight, gargantuan! Baby. (Julius laughs) - This is, any cash advance, Mort? (Mort barks) - I'm thinking of a number. I'm writing it down on this piece of paper. Handing you the piece of paper now. - Wow. Wow! Mort, this is great. This is really great. Now what about number nine, nine? (Mort laughs) - All right, we'll bump it to nine. - No, no, no, number nine. You said you were seeing nine things. Nine, the number nine, nine? - Nine, nine, nine, nine, nine. What was number nine? - Was it a world tour? - No. - [Julius] A cover shoot with Helmet. - Nope. - Free trip on a company plane? - No. - Total creative freedom? - No! - A box at the Forum? (Mort laughs) A couple of Harleys. - Unh-unh. - A mansion. - Unh-unh. - Clean up the office! - That's it. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Mort, Mort, Mort, Mort, Mort, Mort. What? What's it, what's it? - (clears throat) This isn't my office and I gotta get outta here 'cause this shmuck always gets back at 2:15 from lunch. (playful music) - So wait, this isn't Mort's office? You're not Mort? Where's Mort? - My office? Hell no. I'm in the mail room. Catch ya later. Great song, baby. - [Julius] How much do we have now, Wlad? - $83.67. - Well that's great, but it's a long way from a hundred grand. (Chaos barks) (door clatters) (mailman screams) - Up, mail's here. (Chaos growling) (mailman whimpering) - Chaos, oh Chaos, come on. - Make him stop. - Get up. - [Mailman] Help, help me. - Mr. Mailman, I'm sorry about that. - [Mailman] Get him off me! - Come on, come on. We haven't seen you in a while. I'm sorry about that, sir. Are you a coal miner now, or a... - I quit my job and went to work for the water department because of you. I wanted to be underground where it's safe. First day back, they send me here. - Well what's wrong with our water? - Oh, you got a little problem with the sewage in the neighborhood and it's right under your front lawn. Tomorrow I come back and dig up your yard. - That is a drag. I'm sorry about that, I'm really sorry about the dog. - Well do somethin' about it! - I gotta go to work. - Well sedate him, take him with ya. I don't care what, but if he's here when I come back tomorrow, (Chaos barks) I turn him into Korean barbecue, and that's number one with a bullet. - Okay, thank you very much. And by the way that's the last time I eat Korean food, thank you very much. (speaking in foreign language) He's not Russian. He's not Russian, Wlad. He's not Russian. - Not Russian. - He thinks in English, come on, let's go. (speaking in foreign language) (computer keys clicking) - Don't work so hard. (suspenseful music) - Big Pink? (keyboard keys clicking) (computer beeps) - [Computer] Classified document. - Remora. (keyboard keys clicking) (computer beeps) - [Computer] Access denied. - Buffer, what's up? Listen, I got the night off. Yeah, I wanna see you. - [Buffer] Not tonight, Julius. - What do you mean not tonight? - Because I have a private lesson with my squash pro. What is so important? You know, all right, fine. You can come over after my lesson. But be here at 10 and don't be late because I'll be very tired after my lesson and I wanna go to bed early. I know ya do. Bye. So. (sultry music) Tell me, Steve, how are my strokes coming along? No, no, no, no! Not the big toe, the pinky. - Ooh. - What do you mean he thinks he's gonna win the bet? I thought you told me he blew all his money on, what was it, memo paper? - Demo tapes. - Whatever. Pull! (gun fires) (cat yowls) - He thinks he's gonna get some big advance from some record company. Told me so himself. He thinks I'm his friend. It would almost be cute if it weren't so sickening. - Well, you're not gonna let that happen, are ya? - I wouldn't worry about it, sir. - Well I am worried about him! You gotta keep you eye on him. - Hey, what am I supposed to do, follow him around and make sure he doesn't make any money? You are the one who made the bet with him, sir, not me. - Well you are the one who had the bright idea of making him plant manager. If he was still on the floor getting the crap kicked out of him this never woulda happened. - Look, we put him in the manager's-- - What? - We put in the manager's office so that no one would get any wiser about Big Pink and it's worked. The peace conference is scheduled for next week and we'll be ready. - God I'll be glad when this is all over and we can go back to just being manufacturers of mass death. Pull! (gun fires) (glass breaking) - You know what's ironic, Julius has actually turned out to be a fairly effective manager. Better than that fart Dewitt. Profits are up and he has cut expenses by 10%. - Oh, who cares? The place is a write off. I'm more concerned about my daughter. - When was the last time you saw him around here, sir? Buffer's practically forgotten about him. And if you lose the bet, so what? All you were betting was that he could continue seeing her, not that she had to. - She can always change her mind. - Relax, sir. Everything is going according to plan. Trust me. - [Mr. Bidwell] Pull, pull! (gun fires) - Buffer, words can't express how I feel about you tonight, so I've written this here little song. ♪ Buffer I know ya don't like to say it ♪ ♪ Buffer you love me, your eyes betray it ♪ ♪ I'm gonna win that bet with your dad ♪ ♪ And when I do you're gonna be so glad ♪ ♪ So Buffer please don't have a Harry ♪ ♪ I'm beggin' ya now, let's get married ♪ ♪ Oh Buffer, it's you and me together, ooh ♪ (Chaos howling) All right, maybe you're right. Maybe I should just ask her. (ring box clicks) (somber music) (motorcycle engine rumbling) (suspenseful music) Buffer. Buffer. Buffer. Damn! - What's the meaning of this? - [Julius] Mr. Bidwell. I didn't hear ya come in, sir. Have you seen Buffer? - Well, she's certainly not here. What in God's name do you think you're doing? - Um, just using your computer. - Just invading my privacy and spying on my private files. Probably trying to figure out how you can dig your greedy little claws into my money. - No, no, no, it's nothing like that, sir. It's nothing like that. There's this file I saw at the office. I couldn't figure it out. It's called Big Pink. - A likely story, numbnuts, now get outta my house. - Mr. Bidwell, I'm seeing Buffer. - I don't care if you're seeing Elvis. Get the hell out! He knows. Yeah, I want it all outta there. Make the arrangements. Tomorrow at the latest. And take care of numbnuts, bet or no bet. He's dangerous to me alive. Better yet, do the whole factory. I've always hated that place. - [Protestors] Save our Earth. Save this place. Close down Bidwell, don't erase - Hey, scab! - [Protestors] Scab, scab! (protestors shouting) (upbeat music) (gun cocks) (suspenseful music) - Hi, buddy. Hey wait a minute, do you work here? Sir! Come back here! - Julius. - Larry. Larry, I was just wondering, what goes on in the research lab? And how come I don't have a key? - Lab, you mean that room back there? Oh, it's storage, packing materials, tape mostly. - But I thought it was research. - (chuckles) Research, don't be ridiculous. We make erasers, Julius. What sort of research would we do? Formula hasn't changed in 60 years. - Yeah, but we've been getting a lot of strange deliveries of compounds, nitrates, glycerines. What does that stuff have to do with erasers? - (chuckles) That's just our idea of a little inside joke, Julius. I wouldn't worry about it. - Larry, what's Big Pink? - (chuckles) Julius, you're a genius. You are a genius. - I am? - Ya know, I'm a little embarrassed to admit this, but when we first hired you for this job, we were a little skeptical of whether or not you were executive material, so we designed a little test for you, and I'm glad to say that you've passed with flying colors. You follow? (suspenseful music) - No. Larry, what's Big Pink? - Big Pink is nothing. It's a dummy file. We purposely put it into the computer knowing that if you found it, you mastered your job. Congratulations. - Oh, okay. - And since you've proven yourself to be such an ideal employee, I'm giving you a reward. - Get out. - No, I'm serious. I'm giving ya a big bonus, buddy. But it'll be our little secret, okay? I think it'll help you out in your little wager. - For real? - Yeah. As a matter of fact, I'd love to give it to ya tonight, but, God, I'm really pressed for time. Bidwell's asked for a full variance report on this year's production budget and, well maybe you could, no. - No, no, I could do it. It would just take a couple hours. - Really? - Yeah. - God, that would be great. It'd give me enough time to get the check and bring it to your office tonight, perfect. Okay. Thanks. Hey, congratulations. Keep up the good work. - Sure. - Hate that I left a good job a the post office, wasted my college education. That's four years of college wasted, wasted. Maybe I shoulda been an actor. Yeah, I could dig that. (laughs) I can dig it. (laughs) Yeah, I can dig that. I'm so stupid. Job at the post office, but no, I couldn't keep that job. Aw, geez. Okay. I quit. I quit. Retired. (Chaos grumbling) (suspenseful music) (computer beeps) (computer beeps) - Okay, think pink. (keyboard keys tapping) (computer beeps) - [Computer] Classified document. - Damn. Scumbag. (keyboard keys tapping) (computer beeps) - [Computer] Classified document. - Damn. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) - Everything set for tonight? Good. I'll be glad to be rid of the foul smelling dump. Now are you sure numbnuts'll be there when it goes? A bonus. He's a greedy little grubber. Excellent. (knuckles tapping) (playful music) - Julius. - Are you leaving? - Yes. Don't stay too late. (playful music) - [Annie] I can't believe this. He's blowing us off! - You want Twinkies? - No thanks, Wlad. (somber electric guitar music) God, I can't stand this anymore! I'm moving out. - What about deal? - The deal, what deal? There's no deal. We shopped the record everywhere. The only thing Julius is interested in is his loins, not this band. Stay if ya want, I'm outta here. - Wlad go with Annie. (dramatic music) - Oh man, I'm dead. (phone ringing) Annie? Hello? It's me. (phone receiver bangs) Hello? (phone ringing) - I'm not getting it. - Yes, Julius. - Hey Wlad, it's me. Listen, I got tied up late at the factory. Yeah, I think I'm on to somethin'. What's that? - Me and Annie go. - Oh yeah, go. You and Annie go. I'll catch up with you later. I'm working on this thing here. I'm trying to get into this file but it's password protected. Any ideas? Back doors? - Listen, Julius, listen. Must inside, inside mind of person. No thinking, see? No thinking, inside. - Inside mind of person. (suspenseful music) Mind of person. Oh yeah, I get it. I got it. Okay, I gotcha, I'll talk to you later. You guys have fun. Okay bye. (ominous music) (Larry whistling) (Larry exhales) - A stormy night, an unguarded factory. A potentially explosive situation. - Get inside his head. Whose head? Remora's? Bidwell's? What do I know about Bidwell's mind? Egotistical? Criminal? No. Hates me. Yeah. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) Hates me, hates me, hates me. Get inside Bidwell's head. - [Mr. Bidwell] Numbnuts. - I got it, numbnuts. (keyboard keys tapping) (computer beeps) (suspenseful music) - Annie, it's not nice. Let's not do it. - Don't worry, it'll be okay. Come on. - It's not right. - Somebody's gotta teach Julius a lesson. (shovel scraping) (ominous music) Okay, let's get outta here. Goodbye, Chaos! (Chaos howls) (ominous music) (timer beeping) (buttons beeping) (timer beeping) - Wow. I gotta make copies of this. (suspenseful music) (buttons beeping) (buttons beeping) (timer beeping) (Larry whistling) (suspenseful music) (timer beeping) - Vegas, Monte Carlo, Argentina. Oh, I'm gonna miss ya, Julius, I really will. (timer beeping) - Larry, I didn't even know you were here. Are ya okay? Larry, you're never gonna believe what I discovered about Big Pink. Do ya have any idea what Bidwell's up to? Larry, we've gotta blow the lid on this guy. - You are absolutely right. I just found out the very same information today. That's why I came to the office. As a matter of fact, I gotta go. - Hey, wait a minute! What about Big Pink? (suspenseful music) (timer beeping) What about my bonus? - God, Julius, you'll get your bonus. Meet me in my office right away. I think I left my car lights on. - What about your hat? (timer beeping) (Mr. Bidwell laughing) (timer beeping) (explosion booms) So ya lied to me, huh, Larry? Ya lied about Big Pink. Here's your hat. (siren blaring) - [Larry] I don't know what you're talking about. - So you don't know what I'm talking about? - Yeah you-- - Hey, arrest this lunatic! He just blew up the whole eraser plant. - [Julius] No, he's crazy, he's lying! - Somebody do something for Christ's sake. - He's lying! - Lying! - Cuff him, Red. - This maniac just blew the whole factory. - You have the right to remain silent, punk. - Go on, get him in the car! - Come on. - What are you waiting for, you inbred moron. Bye. - You're a liar. - Okay. - You're a liar. - [Larry] Lying. - [Officer] Go on, boy. - [Larry] I don't know what he's talking about. - You're lying, Larry. - You try to help someone, this is what happens. - You're a liar. - Yeah, you're a liar. - Liar, uh-huh. See ya in the joint. (suspenseful music) (inmate humming) (sultry R&B music) (toilet flushes) - Somebody, please. This is all a big mistake. I am not supposed to be here. Anybody got a quarter? Hey big man, ya got a quarter? (inmate grunts) Hey big man, what's your name? - Jaime. Jaime, Jaime, this is not fair. We have rights. Jaime, Jaime. Attica. Attica. - [Inmates] Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! Attica! (men laughing) - Hello, Buffer. - What do you want? - I just wanted to say how sorry I am that things didn't work out with Julius. I, too, was taken in by his very artful canard. - So? - Well, I was thinking perhaps we could have dinner together? Get our minds off this cool blow that's been dealt to us. (sultry music) (knee thuds) (Larry grunts) - Eat that. (inmates chattering) (sultry R&B music) - You blew up the Bidwell factory? - Forget about the factory, that's small potatoes. Back in '63, Dallas, grassy knoll? (mimics gun firing) - You killed Kennedy? (chuckles) - Hey look, first of all the guys in the company don't use words like kill, okay junior? Terminate with extreme prejudice. (hisses) - Was it the mob? - Forget about it, CIA. - "Forget about it, CIA." What do you know, huh? - What? Why couldn't it have just been Oswald, huh? - Oswald's a stooge. - [Prisoner] Then who? - First of all, why would I tell you guys that, okay? I'd be dead like that. - He's got a point. - These guys can and will get you anywhere. - I think so. - Thinks he's right, he thinks he's right. - '63! Damn. You weren't even born then. - '63? Let me just tell you somethin', my Nubian brother. It was '63 that Malcolm and me flew to Mecca. And there wasn't no first class back then neither. We flew coach! Wasn't no free peanuts, chicken, or sundaes. (hisses) - Hm, so you were with the Fruit of Islam? - Fruit? Who you callin' a fruit? Ain't no fruit in my diet. - Yeah, who you callin' fruit? With that big facecloth wrapped around your 400 pound ass. - I aint' talkin' to you, slim. - Yeah, you ain't talkin' to me? You waffle and fried chicken eatin' baboon. - Are you guys gonna talk the talk or walk the walk? - Yeah, are we gonna box or throw rocks? - Well bring it on, Kong. I'm ready to throw down any time you want, man. (inmate squealing) (Jaime growling) - I'm gon' beat ya like you stole my cookie. I'm gon' tear ya up. I'm gon' beat ya like ya owe me money. I'm gonna kill you! (screams) - [Officer] Magruder, made bail, ya have a visitor. - I do? Excuse me. (Jaime screaming) Excuse me, please. I'm sorry, excuse me. - Oh, excuse me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. (Jaime screaming) (siren blaring) (soft orchestral music) - Chaos! You bailed me out? - Yeah. - I thought you left. - I knew you weren't guilty. You are a jerk, but you're not a terrorist. - I guess I lost that bet, huh? - You're in a lot of trouble. - No duh. - What happened? - It was Remora and Bidwell. I've got proof but no one in there will listen to me. God, poor Buffer. Her dad's a hood. It's gonna break her heart. (crowd chattering) - [Man] I can't believe it. - [Man] That thing's gonna be worth a fortune. (crowd chattering) - Wow! - That's a Venus, isn't it? - [Man] Oh man. - Excuse me there, sorry. - Who was the discoverer? - Sir? - [Man] Come back here. - [Dr. Fleckenstein] Are you Julius Magruder? - Yeah, who's asking? - I'm Dr. Fleckenstein from the Bureau of Antiquities. - Look, whatever it is, I didn't do it, okay? - Of course not. (chuckles) It's a miracle. I just verified you're going to be a very rich man. (crowd chattering) - What? - [Man] Where did that come from? - While excavating your property to lay the new sewer we made one of the archeological discoveries of the century. - Venus? - It's not just a Venus, it's a complete Venus from the fall of the Roman Empire. None were thought to exist. How it got on your property I'll never know. It's worth millions. (crowd chattering) - (laughs) Are you serious? All right. - Julius, Julius! (laughs) Julius. Come over here, son. Ha ha! Come over here, buddy. (kiss smacking) - Mr. Bidwell, let me tell you somethin', I know everything that's going on about that factory and you and this guy are goin' down. - I didn't do anything, it was Remora. - What? - Officers, arrest this man. - Big Pink was your idea. I had nothin' to do with it. - Big Pink? What's Big Pink? - Your plan to disrupt the world peace conference with exploding pencil erasers? - Police brutality, police brutality. - Can we be civilized? - Lies, all lies. - [Annie] Jerk. (knee thuds) (Mr. Bidwell grunts) (crowd chattering) - You figured that out? - Uh-huh, uh-huh. - Oh shut up. - Yeah. - Oh shut up. I'm not talking to you. - Daddy! Daddy, what should I do? - [Woman] I think it's gonna be fine. (siren blaring) - Daddy! Julius, I can not believe everything that's happened. I think I owe you an apology. I am so sorry that I doubted you. - It's okay, I mean, under the circumstances I might have done the same thing. - Ya know, with this statue business and everything, you're gonna be a millionaire. Ya know what? - What? - You win the bet. I'm yours. (crowd chattering) - You are? - (chuckles) You know I am. I love you. (soft suspenseful music) - You know what? - What? - I know ya do. - What? - I'm sorry, Buffer, but I gotta go. (upbeat music) - Julius. God, get out of my way. (crowd chattering) - [Reporter] Do you think the value of it will be lost because of the flood? (crowd chattering) - Hey. - Hey. - Do you believe this?
