Bad dream? Sorry if I woke you. It was a beautiful dream. Me doing a concert at the Mall of Asia. There were so many people. Standing ovation. They were all screaming my name... Annelle! Annelle! Easy. I thought she was fine now? I told you before that was just our hope, this is the reality. So, what are our options? She has to stay. We need to observe her for a few weeks. I don't have the money for that. I'm sorry, Liv. I wish there was another way. I suggest we move her to a lower-priced ward. No. Last time when we shared a room, Annelle couldn't sleep. It made things worse for her. Looks like you're the one who's hardly sleeping. Do you need another prescription? Annelle needs you, Liv. Gem, I can come to your office right now. I brought my résumé. Is there really no way I can apply? I'll take any job, even if-- Shit! Let me call you again! ...actually all of them speak in English. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Nice girl. Hello. Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for a job. LGO, the call center, right? Yes. Ma'am, this job fair is for students only. I know. - You're going to have to leave. - Please. Sorry. I'll need to report you. Okay, look. I'm sorry. The past few months have been extremely rough. If you could just take a look at this. I'm the hardest worker you'll ever find. I don't care if I have to deliver coffee to a hundred supervisors or pull double shifts. I really, really need a job. But if you still plan on reporting me, I will fight you. Tooth and nail, right here, right now, because I have everything riding on this. I'm going to ignore the fact that you threatened me for the simple reason that you spoke better English than anyone who's applied so far. I'm going to schedule you for training tomorrow. Does that work for you? Ma'am? - Yes! Yes! - Okay. - Thank you! Thank you so much! - All right. Okay. We'll be needing this. - Even though it's really wet. - Sorry. Why do I need to fix you up? You're old enough. I'm kidding! Sorry, it's been a while. First day jitters. It's normal. There! You look super pretty now. Wasn't I always this pretty? Do you want me to bop you on the head? Gently. I hate that I have to leave you. Why do you need to work at night? That's really how a call center works. But it's okay. At least, I'm here during the day. Don't you like that? We'll always be together. How are you gonna sleep? Don't worry about that. I'll stay until you fall asleep. Okay, fine. I'll stay until you pretend to fall asleep. Good night. Good night, Mom. I'm right here if you need me. I know. - If you need anything-- - Mom. Go. Good luck! Welcome to Liboro House. How may I help you? It's my first day. LGO. Name please. Olivia Sazon. Here you go. Fourth floor. Thank you. Hello! Is anybody there? Hello? Down? Hi, everyone! My name is Lance. I'm a team manager here at LGO and I will be your trainer for the next seven days. So, I hope to get to know each and every one of you over the next few weeks. We're all family here. We're a family now, so don't hesitate to come to me for anything. All right? A quick trip down memory lane... Liboro House used to be a settlement for survivors back in World War II. The family's patriarch, Doctor Jaime Liboro, bought the entire building and turned it into one of Manila's best hospitals in the '70s. Only to be reopened and remodeled into where we all are now. So, lucky us, huh? Hi. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Please take a seat. Some housekeeping tips. LGO is currently the only office in the entire building. The second and third floors are all under renovation, so please be careful when walking around. We don't want any accidents, yeah? Hi. Are you my mentor? - What? - Mentor? For the training? No, I'm not. I'm also a trainee. Cool. Batchmate! I'm Mimi. I'm Olivia. I already know all that. Professional trainee, present! What? Promise, you won't tell anybody here? I'm just here for the training allowance. When it's time for the actual work, I'll find a new BPO. Questions at the back? No, sorry. Sorry, sir. I can teach you the ways of a professional trainee. Just let me know. - Thank you for calling... - TSP Bank. - How can I help you? - Yes, Ma'am. I can do that for you. We can have the late fee reversed. Anything else I can help with? - Sure. - Yes, sir. - Sure, I can help you with that. - Thank you for calling. Which client are you assigned to? What? Which client? TSP Bank Card, Ma'am. Okay, I'd like to know what my outstanding balance is. Use your system. You're taking too long. I'd like to cancel my credit card, please. Ma'am, please wait. I don't know. You don't know? I'm sorry. It's my first day. And it will be your last if you do not know this system by end of day. And that goes for all of you. - Lance. - Yes, Miss Karen? If they fail, it's on you. Yes, Miss Karen. Sir Lance, who was that? Sorry. Karen Liboro, COO of LGO. Child Of Owner? Don't worry. I'll help you out with the systems, okay? Thank you, sir. I'm not too sure I need a new credit card. Yes, ma'am, but you'll be happy to know that our new card's balance transfer program only has an interest rate of 0.88 %. Okay, that sounds good. Send me the e-mail. All right, ma'am, will do that right now. Is there anything else I can help you with? Nope. That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you for calling TSP Bank Card. Have a nice day, ma'am. I don't know what to do. I mean, on one hand, Vince can afford to pay for my Master of Arts program, if I agree to marry him soon. But I don't think I'm ready yet. What should I do? Liv! Advice? Please? Sorry. I don't think I'm the best person to give relationship advice. I was never married. But you have a child, right? Is it hard? Yes, it is. When you have a child, there's always a constant feeling of fear... because her life is in your hands. What do you mean? My daughter is sick. Congenital heart defect. She needs to be operated on soon, but... I don't have money. I'm so sorry, Liv. No, it's okay. But you know what? That fear... also gives me strength. When you become a mother, you can never say things like... "It's impossible." "I can't do it." So, even though... we've been in this situation for quite some time now, I can do it. It's hard, yes. But every time I see Annelle, it's worth it. Everything is worth it. Okay. I've decided. What? I'm staying. What do you mean "staying"? Here at LGO. What happened to your whole "professional trainee" plan? This is all your fault. You're so annoying. You know... despite going through a lot, you're still surviving. Maybe it's time for me to be responsible. Thank you, Auntie! Seriously? "Auntie"? Okay, fine. Sis. That works. Thank you for calling TSP Bank Card. This is Olivia. How may I help you today? Yeah, hi. I just wanted to know how much available balance I have on my credit card. Sure, sir. Can I have your number please? Yeah, it's nine, nine, zero... Hello? - Hello? - Hello? Who was that? You got a kid there or something? No, sir. I thought it was on your end. Anyway, can I have your number again? It's nine, nine, zero, two... - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? Look, this is getting pretty annoying. I'll call back later. I apologize for the disturbance, sir. Guys, guys. Relax, relax. Okay? Looks like it will take some time to fix the electrical issues. Just sit tight. All right? Liv? What's up, sir? I just heard about your daughter from HR. I'm so sorry. I just want you to know, that I put in a good word for you with Karen. So that we can speed up your regularization. Thank you so much, sir. It's no problem. But, you're going to have to prove you deserve it. Karen will keep a closer eye on you, that's for sure. But... I believe in you. Yeah. That's all I have to say. Thank you again, sir. Lance. Family, remember? All right. Yes, sir. I understand, but could you-- Sir? Sir? He's really testing my patience! What's his problem? It's because his card got double charged. He wants to buy something but it keeps getting declined because the double charge ate up his available balance. Now he's very angry and looking to speak to a supervisor. I told him that our team leaders are in a meeting. Pass the call to me. Tell him that I'm your supervisor. But you've already logged out? If we don't do this, you'll never hear the end of it. Besides, he'll listen to me more if he thinks I'm your supervisor. Are you sure about this? Transfer the call to my local number, three-two-one-one. Hi, sir. Can I transfer you to my supervisor? Okay, please hold. Hello, Mr. Morgan? This is Olivia, Mimi's supervisor. How can I help you today? You can take a nap, Mom. No, I'm fine. Can I sing you lullaby? To help you fall asleep? That's my job. Let me do it for once, Mom. Here, I wrote you a song. Really? Wait, pretend to sleep first. I'm suddenly feeling self-conscious. - Don't mind me. Go ahead. - No, Mom. Just pretend you're sleeping. Please, Mom? Okay. Hold on... To me, mother. I will never let go Of your warm, gentle hands. Come with me, mother. Let's welcome This new day We'll take on this journey together We'll conquer this fight together Let's do this together I'll always be here Let's do this together... Welcome to LGO customer service. This is Olivia, how can I help you today? Liv? Did you really pretend to be Mimi's supervisor in a call last night? Yes, sir. You know that was against the rules. Not to mention risky and irresponsible. I'm sorry, sir. I was helping out Mimi. Karen listened to the recordings. And... she was impressed. Turns out, the customer was the son of a VIP client and you handled the situation well. So, Karen has agreed to fast track your employment status. You are now a regular employee, Miss Sazon, with all the company benefits. Are you serious? Sir, thank you. Thank you so much! You're welcome. Hey, I know it's late or early... But, would you like to celebrate? Over some drinks? I'm sorry, sir, but... I have to get back to my daughter. It's okay. I understand. Take care. Bye. Sorry, sorry. What are you doing here? Are you with anyone? Your mom? My name is Olivia. What's yours? I'm Nerisa. Nerisa. What a beautiful name. Come with me, let's go down. Someone might be looking for you there. Hold on. Just follow me, all right? Come. Are you okay? Nerisa? Are you okay? Nerisa? Nerisa? Miss, it doesn't work. Ma'am, you didn't tap out last night. It's 'cause there was a brownout when I left. May I ask what time you left last night, for the log? Around 4:00? Ma'am, there was no brownout at that time. What? Impossible. Anyway... Here you go. Thank you. Thank you for calling TSP Bank Card. This is Olivia. How can I help you? Hello? Hello, who's this? Help! Die! Help! Nerisa? Die! I'm still there. Liv? You okay? Sir, can I take my break early? Sure. Take all the time you need. Thank you. You okay? - Olivia? - Doc, what happened? Something happened to Annelle, can you come? - Hello... Liv? - Hello? - Liv? Are you there? - Hello? Liv? Hello? Shit. Shit! Hello? Hello? Help... Hello? Die! Just die! Die! Die! Liv! Annelle! What happened? Annelle had a seizure a while back. What? But something else happened after. Something... Something I can't quite explain. What? When we checked her heartbeat after she calmed down, her abnormal heart murmur was gone. It just disappeared? Yes, so I went ahead and ordered a scan. The results were completely normal. Like she never had it in the first place. What are you saying? Mom, I'm okay now. Well, of course, it's too soon to tell without more tests and checkups. If everything checks out with her, in a couple of days, Annelle can go home. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. Don't thank me. Thank whoever is watching over Annelle. Annelle, are you all set? Annelle? Mom? What? Ma'am, excuse me. Here is your medical bill. - Thank you. - Thank you. I'm sorry, but... we don't give advances even if you show the hospital bill. So, what should I do? The HMO coverage is not enough. I don't know what else to tell you. Sorry, Olivia. Company policy. Olivia... Hey. Are you okay? I'm sorry about earlier. I just had to say what I had to say in front of HR. But... Here. Sir? It's okay. Thank you, sir. Sir? - Sir! - What? What are you doing? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I locked the door. Let me go! Sir! Let me go! Let me go! Sir! Sir! Are you not used to it? Annelle? I'm talking to you. Sorry. Maybe you're just tired? Mom? - Annelle? - Mom? There's something... There's what? I hear voices... She's talking to me. - What voice? What are you saying? - I don't know. Mom, what's happening to me? Help me... I'm still there... Have mercy... Annelle! Mom? It's nothing. Just go back to sleep. Hey, you okay? - Evening, guys! - Evening, sir! All right, before we start, I just want to give a shout-out to Olivia who just had a special day. I just heard the news that her daughter who's been in the hospital is finally home. That's great news. Congratulations! Congrats, Olivia! You didn't tell me. - I'm so happy for you. - All right, in other news, this week's top agent... Top agent! And the winner is... - Mimi. - Yes! - No! - No way! - And what about it? - It's rigged! English, guys. So, sir, what's the prize this week? How about a date with me? Sorry, sir, but I have a boyfriend. - Choosy! - That's all right 'cause, you know... - what happens in LGO... - Stays in LGO! After that, I ran. I wanted to tell the police, but I chose to keep the check. Shit. Shit. Lance? Am I a bad person, Mimi? 'Cause I still took the money? No. Of course not! You were just thinking of Annelle. The only bad person is that filthy pig, Lance, okay? Okay? Hello? Hello? Anybody here? This is not funny. Who's there? Hello? What's happening? Liv, it's Lance... I know we are all shocked and saddened by the passing of a friend. He was everything an LGO employee should aspire to be. He will be sorely missed. But knowing Lance, he would have wanted us to be strong. To push forward despite this tragedy. More importantly, if any of you know anything about what might have happened to him, I urge you to please talk to the police. Your father is going to pull the plug. What? He can't do that! Yes, he can. People! Please disregard everything that Miss Liboro just said. Effective immediately, Liboro Global Outsourcing will be temporarily closed while the investigation is ongoing. - What about our salaries? - Do not worry, people. We will take care of everything. Annelle, come on and eat. Annelle? Teddy's back, I see. A man was found dead in an elevator. Lance Santos was the team leader at a call center. He worked for Liboro Global Outsourcing or LGO, a BPO company owned by Karen Liboro. In the establishment's CCTV footage, Santos was seen arriving early for his shift. He was seen entering the elevator, but was not seen arriving at the LGO production floor. He was found dead at the scene. According to the initial police reports he was killed through strangulation. Stay tuned as we keep you updated on this developing story. Nerisa? I cast you out of this body! In the name of the Father, and the Son-- Annelle? It's been a while since you last played your guitar. Can you play something for me? Annelle? Annelle? Nerisa? Why are you doing this? When I saw you, I remembered my mother. I want to see her again. How could you do this to Annelle? You couldn't hear me before. This was the only way. What happened to you? I wanted to do this for a long time, but... I couldn't get out. From Liboro House? Until you finally brought me out. My mother's name is Perla. I really want to see her again. I don't know where your mother is. I do. I can feel her. Now that I'm outside, I can feel her. If I help you, will you let me and my daughter be? Can I ask you a question? About Lance... Do you know anything about what happened to him? He's a bad person. He hurt you. He's a bad person. He's a bad person. - He hurt you. - Nerisa. Nerisa! Aren't you happy with what happened to him? He's a bad person, like everybody in that place. He's a bad person! - He's bad! - Let me go, it hurts! - He's bad! - Let me go, Nerisa! He's a bad person! A bad person! - He's a bad person! - Nerisa, you're hurting me! Annelle! Mom? Annelle! What is happening to me? It's okay. Mom is here for you. Okay? I will fix this. We'll get through this. It's okay. It's fine if... you don't believe what I'm saying. No, it's okay. I believe you, but... I just need to process everything. So, where do we go? Nerisa? Go straight. Okay. Just drive, Mimi. She's not scary. This is so crazy. Make a right. Just stay here. We have to go somewhere after this. Are you sure? Take care, please. Here. She's here. She's here? Are you Perla? Why? Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! I'm not your mother. Mom... It's me, Nerisa. How do you know that name? Who are you? She's an enemy, - Nerisa? - Mom! - Nerisa, is it really you? - Mom! My daughter! Oh, my God, it's you, my daughter. I was just a regular employee at the hospital. A cleaner, maintenance staff. Nerisa and I also lived there, as I didn't have a husband to look after her while I was at work. Then one day, Nerisa fell ill. The doctor said that Nerisa had tuberculosis and that she'd died. That's what I was told. It's not true, Mother. After that, they banished me from the hospital. They told me they didn't need me anymore. To date, I don't know why they fired me and why they took and hid Nerisa from me. They hurt me, Mother. They killed me. Why? You didn't do anything wrong, my child. We didn't do anything bad to them. They're the ones who were bad. Perla? I promised Nerisa that... I would bring you to where she is. If we can retrieve her remains, we will all find peace. Do you know where her body is? Hello, Dad. Care to explain to me why you shut me down? Your father is very weak. And I wasn't talking to you. You know that the Liboro House was a tenement before we came. What you probably didn't know was that we didn't exactly deal with the squatters the right way. Most of them were thrown out, right before we started building the hospital. There was this woman, her name was Perla. She approached me. She begged me, that I allow her to stay. I hired Perla as maintenance staff. You know what, she didn't even ask for anything, except to allow her to stay in that old room of hers at the basement. Perla... was always pleasant. The daughter Nerisa was always strange, but damn it, that whole building was always so strange. The hospital was doing very well. We were making money, but there was something that was happening to the place, to the people. Like there was this energy that was forcing people to... To get sick, to leave and... Disappear. People called the building cursed, I called it bullshit. I do not believe in those old wives' tales. Until... Until what? Your mother was friends with Perla and Nerisa for a very long time. She was... always so kind. And that is what killed her. No, no... No, you told me she got sick. You told me she got sick, Dad! What happened? Nerisa! Bridgette! Let me go! Nerisa, what's this? Nerisa, let go of the knife! Nerisa, don't! Let go of the knife! Nerisa, don't do it! - Do you want her? - Nerisa, don't! - Here! - Nerisa, don't! Nerisa! Why did you do that? Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! So the family... used all of our influence. We told the police that Nerisa and her mother just ran away, but the truth is... She never left. I burned that room. But what I should have done was burn the whole building. I should not have allowed you to convince me to give you that place. I don't understand. How could a child do this on her own? She didn't. Are you sure about this? It's everybody's favorite smoking area. Let's go. What are you doing? Professional trainee moves. Rule number one, always flirt with the head of security. Do you have a key for this too? Sis, I never knew this place even existed. Mimi. Help me out. Ready? One, two, three. Okay. Go in first. What? Go in, make it fast. Go ahead. What is this? Where is she? Where is Nerisa? Where are you? Where is your body, Nerisa? Speak! Where is your body, Nerisa? I have a bad feeling about this place. You don't have to be afraid. Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! Mimi! Please have mercy. Don't hurt us. Please have mercy, don't hurt us. Nerisa. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? At last, we can finally do it. Do what? What was never finished. Please help me. Annelle, my child, help me. Annelle, Annelle. "Annelle, help me, Annelle." Mother. This is where it started, this is where it shall continue. I am old. You are beautiful. I am weak. Please don't. You're strong. Please. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? You're next. Olivia, Olivia! Get up! Annelle? Annelle! Annelle! Annelle! Go! Annelle! Annelle! Annelle! My child? Where are you? Annelle, please? Stop it! Stop! Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Please leave. Please leave. Leave me alone. Annelle! Annelle! Annelle! Nerisa. Nerisa, don't! Mom... Annelle, my child, fight it. Don't let her! I will kill her. I will kill her! - Nerisa, don't! - Kill! - Kill! - Nerisa! If you kill her, you will also die. You can't go back. I just want my mother. Your mother is gone. Perla is gone. Leave. Give me back my daughter, please. You want her back? Here! Annelle. I'm always here. She's gone! Mom? Annelle? Go away! "Go away, go away!" Mom... Mom... I'll always be here, Mom. Do it. Mom, I'll always be here. Please, Mom. I'm tired. I'll always be here. Annelle? Annelle? Annelle? Annelle? Annelle, wake up! Wake up! Wake up, Annelle! Wake up! Annelle! Annelle, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Annelle... Sorry. Annelle... We need an ambulance. Liboro House, Escolta. How is she? She's stable. But her heart is weak. It came back when Nerisa left her body. I'm sorry about Annelle. I'm sorry about Mimi. With everything that has happened, we're here again. You don't have to worry about anything. I'll take care of everything. Annelle is going to be fine. You need to rest. Come on. The police are waiting downstairs. I'll stay here. The sooner we talk to them, the sooner you can come back here to Annelle. Come on, let's go. Sorry, ma'am. Liv. Believe me. Everything will be fine. You don't have to be afraid.
