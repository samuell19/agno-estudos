A NETFLIX PRESENTS That's Samanta Sosa, the junkie who was a regular at the precinct. A spark started the fire. She was asleep and couldn't react. Looks like she was drunk. Paredes found her a couple hours ago. He's still scared shitless. That Sami was a good-looking girl. It's a shame, man. We always lose the best. A FEW HOURS BEFORE - How'd it go? - Fine. I'll go give Manchado a bath and some water. He's beat. Okay. Come on, Manchado. Do you want to see the masks your kids ordered for tonight? No, it's their party. I'll check the girls and try to catch the game. The black apron is fine. No makeup. Or accessories. Luis is here. Aren't you running late, ma'am? Even better. Rómulo can wait for me. How are you, Luis? Oh, honey. Careful. It's really crowded. Stay close. We're near Toto's mom's stand. Fine, go. Be careful. If I didn't know you, I'd say you're still into him. But you do know me. Right. Just saying. After two years, you can say hi. He won't bite. Auntie, no. It'd be good for you to go out. I'm here. I don't mean once a year. Paco, you came! I'm here with you. I didn't know you were back. I thought Paco would stay in Madrid. Apparently not. Just accept it already. Your brother calls him. What's more annoying? To be forgotten or unnoticed by him? Sami, what are you doing? Estela is right there. Take that stuff to the kitchen. Do I know you? Nahuel Mamani! You're under arrest for robbery! - Stop. - Don't take him, please! - Come on. Get up. - Stop. Let her go. Easy. Shut your mouth. - Easy. - Let her go! Easy, I said! Easy! - Please! No! - Get off her, Pérez. - Who's there? - Evening, ma'am. I'm Luis Paredes, Juan's dad. Sorry for the scare. Your son knows me. Is something up? I'm on the cougar's trail and wanted to keep on it. I saw it two hours ago on the road. - Can I go across here? - Sure. Listen, Ms. Manuela, keep your door shut tight. That animal is fierce. Especially since you're on your own. Thank you. Mom? What's up? It's nothing. I just couldn't sleep. Manuela, Sami was found dead. I can't hear you. Hi. Samanta Sosa. She was found dead at the Pico del Águila shelter. PRECINCT 57 LA QUEBRADA Could she have stopped by while we were at the party? Is anything missing? No. I was in the shed. Why ask if something's missing? Earlier she stole an expensive necklace from her employer. - Where was she working? - At the Carreras's party. Thanks for coming in. That's fine. I came here as soon as I heard. - Hi there! - I want to see Nahuel Mamani. You got lonely up in the sticks and came looking for a real man? You little... How can we help, Luna? - Pérez, finish that report. - Yes, sir. - Have you seen him? - Not yet. Let me in, Rufino. I want to see him. He's in solitary. I can't. He was beaten up. He's hurt. It's out of my hands. He resisted arrest. I need to talk to him. Help me, please. I'll tell him anything you want on your behalf. CAUSE OF DEATH: FIRE/ACCIDENT That's all I can do. - You can believe me. - Go on. Let him through. - My pleasure. - See you. INCOMING CALL ALICIA Tell my niece what you told me. Who ordered you to clean all this up? The town council. They will build a post so people can be safe. Did you know the woman who died? Yes, Sami. She came often. Here and the north chapel. Sami wasn't religious. She stole a necklace from the Carrerases, slept at the post, and had the accident. Why did she go by your house? She took a shortcut. My place is on the way from the ranch. Why not my place? She was by herself. And she didn't always drop by. She was making an effort. We know how these cases go. How many relapses for every recovery? What are you implying? That her addiction killed her and she had it coming? I didn't say that. I said it looks like an accident. I got the report. When the autopsy report is ready, I'll close it. I'll get statements from the Carreras's staff. You won't need to. García talked to the help. And brought the girl's belongings from the house. Ask him. I got Manuela Pelari's statement. She's Alicia's niece. She was the last one to see Samanta Sosa alive. What should I do with Ms. Carreras's necklace? Leave it with me. I'll get it to her. What the police say isn't good enough. They don't care. Yesterday I was with her. Now she's dead. I need your help. If she had a relapse or an accident, I want to know for sure. I'll accept it, but only if you can confirm it. It's the least I can do to lay her to rest. I am as sad and surprised as the rest of you by what happened recently. Our town is mourning. CANDIDATE An innocent girl's disappearance is a tragic incident that makes us reflect on the precarious state of the facilities that the town council is liable for. What amazes me the most is the Mamani family's report. Was it an unlawful arrest? We don't know. What's your fucking job, Mellino? Tell me. A Qulla leader ended up beaten. A girl scorched to death. All in less than four hours. Nahuel's arrest should have been clean-cut, a model arrest. And instead, the family is claiming police brutality. And the Qulla girl? What's your excuse with her? Why won't you listen, Rómulo? Mamani resisted arrest. What happened to that girl was an accident. A god-awful coincidence, but an accident all the same. I don't give a fuck about the Qulla. But I want to lay it out for you. We are four days away from elections. Torres is lashing out in the media. The mining company is pressuring me. Plus, Etelvina. The Americans' deal feeds us all. Keep your end of the bargain. I know fully what my duty is. Just had bad luck. Nahuel is locked up. He's no trouble. Get Mamani a doctor, food, clothes, whatever. On it. - They can't see him all beaten up. - Okay. Don't make me do something I don't want to do. Let's keep things civil. You get it. LA QUEBRADA POLICE DEPARTMENT NAME: SAMANTA SOSA Hello? Hello? CELL PHONE TRACING AND TRACKING REQUEST NUMBER 387 4638896 My niece Manuela needs to ask you some questions. Go ahead. It's about Samanta Sosa. Did you know her? It's important for me that you answer. No... but I knew who she was. When they hold events at the house, we hire people. Extra staff. María recommended her. María is trustworthy. I saw it as reason enough to hire her. Alicia, I know how much you help these girls. And I know everything you do, but not all of the girls are good. Why do you say that? Like I told the officer, she ran off when I caught her stealing. It surprised me to see Ms. Mecha's necklace on her. And what happened then? I told her to put it back immediately. But she was very upset. She said it wasn't her and she didn't steal anything. - Did you see her again after that? - No. I looked for her, but that's when she must have fled. You can ask María. They were friends. Excuse me, María Segovia's house? Right there, at the corner. Hi. Are you María, Samanta's friend? Yes. I'm Manuela, Alicia Pelari's niece. - What do you want? - To know what happened. They say it was an accident. Yes. And she was caught stealing. Says who? Estela. She had the necklace. Why? You knew her well. Did she seem off? Off how? Drugs? Sami was clean. That's why I got her the job. Did you know she hid her loot at the chapel? I don't know anything. LA QUEBRADA BREAKS THE RECORD WITH CRUZ CARRERAS Would you come with me, Captain? Thanks, Estela. I wanted to bring it myself. - I thought I'd lost it. - I know how important it is. Did you recognize it? It was my mother's. I haven't worn it in ages. I gave it to Mechita for her wedding. And now you need to calm down, Etelvina. It's over. I'm worried about Cruz. He got worse. Do you want me to talk to him? Or if there's anything else you need. You know you can count on me. As always. You've done enough. I don't know how to thank you. It's best if you leave now. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hey! Give me a kiss? Oh, okay. They are all there. ESTIMATED LOCATION Hoodie, gloves... Your description suggests he's not just any burglar. Do you think this guy may have known you? I don't get what you mean. I mean, it may have not been a random break-in. There are no thieves in La Quebrada who fit that description. Perhaps they want something from you. Or someone has a personal grievance against you. No. Is that registered? What did you do for a living before coming to La Quebrada? I've lived here for ten years. I work in the field. Ms. Pelari, we too want to find the man who attacked you. I was in the police. In the police? We're colleagues then. What division? Violent crimes. That's why I retired. Well, you know this makes the situation totally different. You worked in a division where it's easy to make enemies. Think about it, please. Think hard. Try to remember. Someone could be after you to settle a score. No one's after me. I'm not on the run. Of course not. I didn't say that. Okay. Any more details? No, that's it. Call me anytime. - Yes, thank you. - All right. Let's go. CORNELIA VILLALBA CASE I thought by letting go of Cornelia, I was paying my debt. But then it became a black hole. For you, Cornelia was a childhood friend, not a dealer. I was a cop, and I let her go. That was a mistake. A mistake you already paid for, Manuela. Why punish yourself? What for, anyway? It was useless. That is not true. It made you become who you are now. I fight with that person every day. When you brought me here, I swore Tobías and I would have a violence-free life. Without Pipa. What happened today isn't connected to your past as a cop. It isn't. I know. Well, then... what's wrong? The guy checked outside first. Why there? He knew Samanta was here, so he came. In that case, it wasn't an accident. FULL NAME: MANUELA PELARI ...RECKLESS BEHAVIOR... Rufino. Luna, why come now? It's his birthday. He cried all day long. He wants to see his dad. Let us in just for a few minutes. I told you he's in solitary. I don't want problems. Let's go, baby. Okay. Luna! Play. NORTHWESTERN PATO CLUB Your brother should be here. What happened? I don't know. He's not answering. I can't manage everything constantly. It's a key moment for the mining company, the election... Why is that contract so important, Mom? Come on, Mechita. When will you understand it's not a contract? It's what I've been building for 25 years. I ask for two things. Two. Focus on your engagement, and handle your brother as usual. This time is different. Then grow up, darling. Think like a daughter of mine, not about nonsense and parties. - Agustín. - Etelvina. - My dear. - How are you? Ready for tonight's toast? Yes. - I'm very happy. - That's good. Why couldn't Cruz make it? A migraine. A last-minute thing. If you'll excuse me, I need to go. Of course. Without Cruz, this team sucks. Cruz sucks. Come on, honey. Don't start. You're telling me not to start? Look, I came back after five months to announce our engagement because you and Dad asked me to. I get here, and your brother is in the worst shape ever. He's going through a rough patch. He always is. He knows you're moving to London? I was thinking about that. Can we take him with us? You think I don't realize how things stand, but know this. I don't want Cruz in our lives, Mecha. He's a ticking time bomb. So, think it through. Sooner or later, you'll have to choose. You can't have us both. It's him or me. It's freezing cold. After a while, you won't notice. You'll see. - Do you regret the other day? - Yes. Don't you? Not all of it. It was a mistake. - It shouldn't have happened. - Will you get married? Why even ask? Of course I will. Why? - You should be clean for tomorrow's game. - Was Dad there? Dad's dead, Cruz. Mom will cover for me. Make something up. - I don't want to go. - Mom only thinks about herself. She's pressuring me. Poor baby sis. Stuck with the worst of us. - Hi. - Hi. I got a report from school. - Something happened to Tobías? - Not exactly, but... it's serious. Again. Don't miss this time. - I'll go. - Tobías skipped school. Did you know? - What? - I think I know where he is. Wait for me! - Yay! - Great! - I'm going. - No, it's my turn. Suqu, come. - I'll go. - No, it's my turn. Take it. Be careful. Take the bullet. - Snap it. - Suqu'll miss. Shut up, Toto. Cock it. On the sight. Aim there. You can do it, Suqu. Go, Suqu. Tobías! Why did you come? I'll find you. Go home. Hand it to me. No. Put it down. It's dangerous. Why are you doing this? Now they'll make fun of me. I don't care what your friends think. Hand it to me. Do you think I can't? It's Juan's, not mine! - He'll be mad. - Not more than me. - You lied to me. - You're the liar. I hate you. Being a single parent is hard. I lied to him. It's my fault. You did it to protect him. Thanks. How did you find him? By accident while tracking Samanta Sosa's lost cell phone. Sami's cell phone is lost? The antennas didn't find the exact spot. They showed a broad area. I couldn't find it. The Carrerases live five kilometers away. If the phone is on, someone has it. It hasn't been on since. It may have run out of battery or could be lost in the valley. She could've lost it before the party. It's not conclusive. You still think it was an accident? There's no proof. No sign that would justify opening a murder investigation. You were a cop. You should know. Maybe she didn't steal. She had the necklace. Witnesses saw. Did the guests give statements? Were the Carrerases questioned? There's no need to question anyone. Much less the Carrerases. Do you know something? No. You think I don't care? Sometimes we have to do things we don't like to uncover the truth. I'm not like you. - What do you mean? - Why did they fire you? You investigated me. I'll look into it, but promise me you won't interfere. You're not a cop. I have to go. Alicia, I need a favor. I brought this. It's your son's. - Thanks. - Do you go hunting? Yes, I can station myself at the Los Castillos post. Come in. Sorry, but this house lacks a woman's touch. My boy Juan's mom passed away a while ago. The two of us manage as best we can. Go ahead. I know you're a hunter and Juan meant well, but guns are off-limits for my son. I'll deal with Juan, and it won't happen again. I appreciate it. I see you work for the Carrerases. My family has always worked for them. Juan works at their farm too? No. My boy is studying. Did you see Samanta Sosa the night of the party? No. I wasn't at the party. I was tracking the cougar and found her dead. Well, Ms. Manuela, if you'll excuse me... Okay. She'll talk to you, not with the police. Thank you. Don't thank me. She's back because Alicia asked. If she thinks you can find out what happened to Sami, fine. But no one can know. Including Rufino. Okay. Where is she? Anything you can tell me is useful. Sami was having the best night ever. Looked like a princess. Mirror, mirror on the wall... - who's the fairest of them all? - Grow up. Your jokes disgust me. You gave my favorite necklace to that grubby Indian. Are you jealous? Are you for real, Cruz? Stop. You know you're the only one I care about. Did you go crazy? - Ms. Mecha is furious. - What for? - Her necklace. - Cruz gave it to me. Return it and get back to work. Estela can't know. The boss is not who you think. The boss never cared for us. He does for me. He'll take me to tomorrow's game and introduce me to important people. He says I can model if I want. Don't let him fool you. He's just annoying his sister. Why are you saying that? You're jealous. What are you doing? You're ruining everything. Want me to be happy? Give those things back while you can. It's not too late. That's the last I saw of her. Had I insisted, she might be alive. None of it is your fault. You should understand that. Luna said that, but you don't know how I feel. I do know. Years ago I lost a friend. Cornelia. And it marked my life forever. But not because she passed, but because I felt responsible for not having done enough to help her. What did you do to stop that feeling? I did nothing. I still think I could have saved her. What do you drink? The same. I've never seen you here. That's odd. So, what do you think? Is an age difference a problem for you? No. For you? She was 16. What's this? At your party. You gave her your sister's necklace. Yes. We were having fun. Except she turned up scorched somewhere in the sticks. What? I didn't know she was dead. Listen up. Everyone saw the two of you. And she was found dead. What happened? What did you do? I didn't harm her. I swear. - Sorry. I should go. - Don't, please. What happened at the party? - Nothing. - Do you have her phone? Cruz. I've been calling you for an hour. Go with your sister. She's tense. - I would be too if I had to marry Agustín. - Stop, Cruz. I'll see you there. I'm sorry, but Mom's orders must always be carried out. What do you need? Information. Would it be easier if I talk to you? I don't think we have a lot to talk about. Samanta Sosa. Worked for you the night she died. Yes, I heard. Poor girl. If her family needs help, just come to us. - There's no need to involve my son. - But your son knew her. He knows a lot of people, but I doubt he knew her. Cruz gets mixed up. Don't believe everything he says. His health is delicate. And do you look after him? Yes. Just like you. You're a mom too, right? It's an important day for my family. Please leave your questions for another time. I know about your aunt's work with the communities. I respect her for that. We help out too. We did even before she came here. They claim the land the mining company wants. Will you help with that? The land has been in the family for generations. If it's a matter of ancestral claims, theirs go a bit further back. I see now the topic interests you. I pegged you as someone who liked her solitude. You don't know me. You're right. You don't know me either. If you'll excuse me... Manuela, right? Manuela Pelari. I go by Pipa. Good night to you, Pipa. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for coming. I'd like to say this union makes me very happy. And on today's engagement, we'll set a date for the wedding, and a year from now, these two young lovebirds will join their lives forever. And two close families will become one. Welcome, my dear. Thanks, Dad. Thank you, Rómulo. This is the happiest day of my life. To be topped only by the day I walk down the aisle on my brother's arm. As you know, this is a longtime dream of mine. And it came true, my love. To the future, and to our children's happiness... - Cheers. - Cheers. Hooray for the couple! Hooray for love! Cheers. So, you did come. I had to go somewhere first. Your call got me curious. Is it personal or work-related? Both, I guess. I misjudged Cruz Carreras. Why is that? I was just with him. He learned from me that Samanta was dead. Had no clue. - You were with the Carreras's boy? - Yes. And the mother. I'm missing something. I don't know what. I need your report and photos from the scene. Nothing I can do will get you off this case, right? No. I don't want to get you in trouble. You don't care if you do. At least don't lie. If you want me as an accomplice, answer this. Why'd you stand me up? Huh? I can't remember. It was so long ago. Fine. I'm not good at choosing men. How do you know? I never got a chance. It's not you. I'm poor company. Believe me. That should be for me to decide. - Maybe there's another reason. - Why is it then? Out of fear of liking me. You don't know me. - We're very different. - Then allow me to. Look what you did to it! Turn up the volume. Come on. This is how La Quebrada Police treat us. White people's police. INDIGENOUS LEADER AGAINST THE POLICE No doctor was called. We need to be seen, to be heard. Will we keep allowing this? It was Luna. I let her in. Our community is in danger. It's our land. We have a right to it. Cut it off. Mayor Oregón's military arm subjugates us. It doesn't protect us. That's what happened with Nahuel Mamani's violent arrest. And that's not all. What really happened to Samanta Sosa? CANDIDATE Do you know the guy in the photo? It's Agustín Oregón, the mayor's son. That photo was taken just hours before Sami was found dead. Those in power, and their kids, have a lot to answer for. That bastard. - What was that, Dad? - Relax. I'm tired of your problems! - It has nothing to do with you. - You're not in my shoes. Leave already. No one wants you here. - Agustín! - No, Agustín. That's it, Mercedes. I have to get out of this fucking town! Let's leave now, get married in London, and never come back! What's so funny? - Agustín. - Don't! Registration, please, miss. Why was I pulled over? Checkpoint. I have a suggestion for you. Mind your own business from now on. Get it? No, I don't. If you keep bugging the Carrerases, you'll be facing harassment charges. And I won't be as nice as I am now when I have to bring you in. So, listen to me very carefully. Keep being such a pain, and not even your white face or those slutty eyes will save you. That clear? I'm waiting. Yes, it's clear. Here you go. Your fiancé approved? Does it hurt? I needed to come too. It's my favorite place. Our best years. I wish we could go back. What I did was wrong, Mecha. - I can't get it out of my head. - It was an accident. You did it for me, to protect me. Like when I almost drowned here as a girl. You saved me. Remember? The same way. Now I'm the one drowning. You can't leave me alone. You'll leave me. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I didn't know how. Look at me. Stop hurting yourself. Promise me. Okay? Do it for me. You leaked María's photo of Samanta with the mayor's son. We needed to be heard, to be seen. You exposed María and messed up the inquiry. You don't know if he was in on it, yet you implicated him. So that Oregón loses? Someone killed Samanta. Do you care? And you? Are you okay with this? It's their land. You asked me for help. You only see part of the problem we have on our hands. You don't know what's at stake. They've ruled for ages, go unpunished, run the town, and use us. They make a fortune off our land. If Oregón loses, we may have a shot at getting it back. What about Samanta? Whatever your intentions, if we never find out what happened, you're no different. I'll never be like them. You think we can choose? We can't. Neither did Samanta. I should leave you two alone. Manuela, they have their reasons. You can't judge them. Besides, the scandal can help. Sami's death is all over the news. There's nothing conclusive. No proof, no suspects, and no motive except for some circumstantial photos at a place and a time not coinciding with her death. I lost my way. Follow the winding road. A cop threatened me last night. They work for the Carrerases and came for me after I talked to Cruz. Everyone here works for the Carrerases. Yes. Everyone. Silence, please. Dear journalists, not everything goes in politics. Of course not. But candidate Torres seems oblivious to this fact. My family and I were pained to see him on the news last night, playing dirty by framing my son Agustín with a photo taken out of context. And I'm not worried because my son Agustín has nothing to hide and can defend himself. But young Samanta Sosa can't do that. And it worries me that they'd use her death to get a few votes. We won't allow that. I agree with the mayor. At the precinct that I run, we're investigating this tragedy, and since the beginning, the inquiry has been overseen by Mr. Rufino Jerez, a respectful and valued member of the Qulla community. Thank you, Captain. I think I have something. Paredes lied. He said he wasn't at the party, but he went by my house dressed up. Then María confirmed it. Whoever it was, they may plan to disappear. I'll watch the Los Castillos post. Preliminary autopsy reports rule out firearms and sharp weapons. Agent Jerez, after Nahuel Mamani's video went viral with the report of his brutal beating at the hands of the police, how do you respond? - About that topic... - Good question. Sorry, Jerez. I'll be responding. Precisely to inform you that Officer García, who's in charge of the operation, has been discharged from the force. What is unclear... La Quebrada needs to be a paradise again. So, please don't fall victim to Torres's manipulations. So that our town can go back to having progress and peace. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. You've been spying on me for a while. Why is that? Why did you lie to me? Why deny going to the party? - Leave. - No. You were tracking Samanta, not the cougar. - What do you want? - To help you. I'll do my best if you tell me what happened. You don't know what you're getting into. You followed her after the party. All the way to my house, to the post. What happened? Why did you chase her? Did she seem different then? Did she reject any advances from you? What are you suggesting? She led you on all night, right? You couldn't resist? You were alone with her in the middle of nowhere, you forced her, she fought back, and you got mad. No. I'm not a pervert. It was an accident... right? A mistake? What happened? I never meant to hurt her. Let's go. Come on. Chop-chop. - Go on, let's move! - Okay, I'm coming! Turn yourself in. No. No. That girl was in the wrong place, like you are now. Do you get it? Why did you look for her? What did you want from her? Go on. What will you do? Will you kill me too? Leave. Drop the gun! Come out with your hands up! Are you okay? Yes. He fled through the back. - Will you be okay alone? - Yes. Tobías will stay with Alicia. Accept police protection. Paredes could come back. No, thanks. I'd rather look after myself. Your partner almost blew my brains out. We asked the capital for backup to find him. He knows the area. He wasn't going to kill me. He was about to turn himself in. He'll only come for his son. He killed Samanta. Yes, but why? Besides, he smothered her, but it was not a premeditated crime. He wouldn't do the fake fire setup. That was planned. Designed to erase something he did. He has an accomplice. There's a cover-up. I hurt the guy who broke into my house. Paredes was fine. Are you positive? Yes. Has Sami's phone been on? Yes, earlier at the valley's entrance. Please tell me when it's on. Don't tell a soul. I need to go. I'm leading the investigation only because it's now good for them. In any case, I'm responsible. Be careful. You too. What are you doing here? The police are looking for you. What happens to my son if I go to jail? No jail for anyone. Go to the backwoods until things settle down. Leave Juancito to me. Don't worry. He'll have everything he needs. I was only following orders, ma'am. The responsibility is yours alone. I didn't ask you to kill anyone. Open up, Mom. Leave, Luis. What did you do? They killed her. It was you. I was protecting you, as usual. No. From what? It wasn't me. Your stupid decisions killed her. She saw you. Otherwise, she would be unharmed. What did you want? To make your sister jealous? Huh? Gave her your sister's clothes, necklace. What were you thinking, son? They only want money to get pregnant. Can't you see? That's not true. Not everyone is like you. Do you think I haven't heard? Don't play saint with me. Do you think it hurts? I don't feel a thing. I don't care. I'm going to talk. Good day. Where's the paperwork? Look who's here. The new boss. The new boss is here. I know, the new boss. I say hi, see? Okay, I'll piss off. I'm taking the van. ESTIMATED LOCATION LOS CASTILLOS GPS TRACKING ON SAMANTA SOSA Yes. I'll handle it. Her phone was turned on in the Los Castillos area. Hold on. LOS CASTILLOS GULLY Paredes found the cougar's last tracks there. There's more. Other policemen are on their way to track the phone. Mellino's orders. So, it was them who broke into my house. That phone must have something on it. Yes. But who has it? Take a photo as proof. What is it? Tracks. Whose tracks? A cougar's. - Boy. - Why are you here? To talk to you. About what? Take my statement. Think. You have nothing to say to the police. - I did something awful. - That means squat. Who you are and what you'll do means something. Look that way. That is your town. It's your land. Your legacy is your duty. Your mom is managing everything now. When the time comes, it'll be your duty, boy, to step in. - I don't want to. - You don't understand, dammit! Listen, Cruz. Look at me. Being a Carreras isn't a choice. That's how it is. No officer will take your statement. Go back home right now. Your mom's worried sick. Let's turn around. We can't go through. They want Mamani. - I'll call for backup. - No, I'll handle it. Stay with the detainee. - No recordings. Put that away. - Go on. So, you're calling the shots. Our freedom of expression with a peaceful demonstration. Worried about Mamani? Mamani? Bring him. Damn it... Come on here, Mamani, get here. There's your Mamani. Look. There he is. Hey, no contact. - Don't touch her, you bastard. - Shut up. As long as it's not the whore bitch that popped you out, dirty Indian. Stand up. I didn't hurt you. And you, you can't take a criminal, understood? If he is a criminal, then I am too. Grandpa also wants to play hero. Come detain him. Take him. Handcuff him. Come on. Cuff them, quickly. One by one, they'll fall. Go on, do it. Call Jerez so he can bring the van and I can take them all. LOS CASTILLOS - 45 KM Show me the gun, okay? Sure. - Yeah, it's great. - It is. - Can I shoot? - No, it's my mom's. - What do I do if the cougar comes? - Run, I guess. According to Juan, if you do, it'll attack. Oh, fine. The cougar! Fucking kids! You'll all be arrested. Go, get them! Paredes! I'll get you! Give me the phone! - I don't have it. - Who does? - Tobías. - Who? Tobías Pelari. Get lost! Get going! You're not going anywhere, boy. Stop it! Settle down! Come, boy! Come back, boy! ESTIMATED LOCATION LOS CASTILLOS Jerez, it's been five minutes. Luna, if you take him, he'll become a fugitive. Will he live in hiding? Rufino's right. Okay, I'm done waiting. Come on, handcuff her. Go. Want to face disciplinary action? I am responsible for Mamani's protection, not you. You're not telling me what to do. I'm your senior officer. I am now an actual officer appointed to Samanta's case. You think you'll get a medal for that, stupid? - I said, do it. - No. Lala, let him go. Take him. Oh, so you're with the half-caste too. You bunch of wimps. I guarantee his safety and due diligence in his statement. Trust me. I know what I'm doing. Okay. Let's go. You're a traitor. Expect disciplinary action. We'll see what the boss says. What's with you? You broke into Manuela Pelari's home to get Sami's phone. - Where did you get hurt? - Are you accusing me? I know you're involved in the cover-up of her death. So, what do you want? For you to think about what will be best for you when all this comes out. If you help, your involvement is minor, unlike what's behind it. Mellino will handle it. Maybe, maybe not. Fine. Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing? Fuck you, asshole! - Why are you here? What's wrong? - We tracked the cougar. Do you have Samanta's phone? El Suqu does. He was recording the hunt for you. Hey! What happened? - Where were you? - I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to shoot. Calm down. What are you talking about? We were hunting. You had a gun? Yes. Mom's gun. It went off and the policeman fell. I'm going to jail. No, honey. No one's going to jail. Yes. They're looking for me. They wanted the phone. I found it outside the yard. I didn't steal it. I swear I meant to give it back. Are the police looking for it? Are you sure? Auntie. Auntie. Auntie. Go look for your mom through the back door. Run and don't stop. Tell her everything and give her the phone. Cruz. Hi, Mecha. Cruz, where are you? I'll go find you. Did you know they killed her? Yes. I wanted to tell you. Everything. I shouldn't have lied. Where are you? Let me help you. I can't even say what I did. I'm tired of feeling like shit. What are you saying? You were the most important person to me. What? I still am. I love you. Listen to what I'm going to tell you. It was my fault. It wasn't you, it was me. I killed him. Cruz? Cruz! Cruz! Cruz! Mom! Mom! No! No! Cruz! No! Mom! Captain. Is something up? Alicia. We need to discuss something important. Can we come in? I'd rather we talk here. Alicia, let's talk inside. Please. This is your niece's gun. What do I have to do with it? Pipa's not here. I'm looking for the boy, her son. - What for? - He shot one of my men. It wasn't serious, but things could get worse. Tobías could never do such a thing. He was armed with other boys in the backwoods. My men found them while tracking a fugitive. Alicia. Will you answer? Look, Mellino, I told you I don't know anything, and I'm alone. The signal is still here, and the horse is outside. Don't make me do something I don't want to do. I know your nephew's here. Bring him now. No. Okay, García. Search the whole house. Fine! The boy's not here. But I have the phone. Okay. Fine. Listen, Alicia. You have my word nothing will happen to Pipa or the kid. But this needs to end now. You're right. Chief? Follow her. Is Sami's phone with you or inside? How many did you see? Three of them. Get out of my house now. She wouldn't give us anything. Get every unit on Manuela Pelari for Alicia's murder. Yes, sir. What's up? No signal. They turned it off. It must be close. The boy fled. On the horse, to the woods. Fuck! Come with me, you hear me? Go on, García, go! You stay here. You're tough, you old whore. You don't want to die? I don't understand a damn thing you're saying. I'll help a little. Now you'll see what your fate is. You're really hot, you slut. I feel lonely here. Don't you want to marry me? Huh? The cell phone. Yes. I've got it. Give it to Rufino. Go with Tobías. Don't go looking for them. Promise me. The boy's not here. He played us. Hey, what's with you? Leave, Paco. Relax you two. Hey, it's me! - Get out! - Get out of here, you pervert! You're calling me a pervert? Look at you. No. Don't start imagining things. - Easy. - Not much left to the imagination. Shut up, you bitch! You always wanted to fuck Cruz. Someone beat me to it. Stop, Mecha. - What? Stop. - What's up? Relax. - You perv. - I'll kill you, bastard! Why do you get like this? Get him out of here, Cruz! I'm not afraid of you, bitch Barbie! - Snap out of it. - No. Hey, what's up with you? Get Mom. Call an ambulance. Mom? An ambulance? Are you nuts? No one can see you. Get the SUV, we'll put him in. Don't tell a soul, okay? Come on, Cruz! Go! Go on. What happened? What are you doing here, Paco? Why did you come? You didn't have to. Cruz. Where did he go? I'll tell everyone, you'll see. What will your mom say now? No chip, they won't find us. I'll take you to the border. Come on. Does it hurt? A little. Calling all units. Arrest warrant for Manuela Pelari. License plate 470. Mom. Hold on tight. Unit 12 here. Now in pursuit of the fugitive. Light blue Ford truck. License plate VTG280. Engaging pursuit. I repeat, engaging pursuit. Come on, lady! Move! Move! Come on! MINE CLOSED AUTHORIZED ENTRY ONLY AREA CLOSED NO ENTRY - NO TRESPASSING Pipa, where are you? You're wanted for murder. They killed her. Mellino killed Alicia. What? Go. And Paredes too. I have Sami's phone. I'm at the Pico del Águila mine. I need you to come and take Tobías. Take Tobías? What will you do? Pipa! DANGER DO NOT ENTER - So, man? - They're still inside, sir. Okay. Go to the crosswalk. No one comes in, you hear me? Yes, sir. It's a lot of blood. She's running out of time. She must be all messed up. Mom. Mom. They're coming. Pelari! Go that way. You've got nowhere to run, Pelari. Give us the phone. Enough people have died. You need to go. Go hide. Give it to Rufino. He will find you. I don't want to leave you. I love you, son. Go on. Now. Now. Go. Hey! Surrender it! García. The belt gun too. It didn't have to come to this. You know I am a magnet for policemen like you. You told Paredes to cover it up with the fire. Paredes is useless. He had to frighten her and get the video back. But why did you help him? Why cover for the Carrerases? You didn't have to get involved. I'm tired of cleaning up after the Carrerases. - I didn't have a choice. - That's not true. You didn't have to do it. Neither did you. Yet here we are. I'm protecting my son. Well, me too. Cruz? Give me the damn phone. I don't have it. No. No, Tobías. Put it down. Put the gun down, Tobías. Listen to me, boy. Give me the phone, okay? It's okay, Tobías. Give it to him. Forgive me, Mom. Okay. Do you swear to say the truth about what you know, saw, heard, or perceived in connection to Samanta Sosa's murder? I solemnly swear.
