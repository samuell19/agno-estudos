T.T.'s the name. Just blew in from the Windy City. Chi Town. I just fell by the Golden State to check out the scene and hear some of those cool West Coast sounds. I was wondering if you could direct me to the local jazz spots so I could dig some of those hot licks. Duke's. He knows all about that stuff. Copacetic. Jackson, definitely Jackson. Hear that riff? Hey, kid, how did you get in here? Man, you got everybody on this thing. Yeah. I came in to dig the sounds and check out the local scene. Well, this is it, but we're not really opened yet. You blow trumpet? Not really. It's my brother's axe. Your brother's axe? He left it to me. He died. Where's the rest of it? In there, along with his recordings. Originals. Original whats? Recordings. Stuff that he played on gigs. Yeah? I'd like to hear 'em sometime. How about now? I brought 'em with me all the way from Chi. You brought these all the way from Chicago? Along with his axe. My brother Phil? He was always talkin' about the ocean, and how he'd like to be able to see the ocean and play his trumpet at the same time. So I thought If I could go where I could see the ocean, and play one of his recordings- We'll listen to 'em later, but right now I got a lot of things to finish up before I open. Copacetic. Copacetic? Come on, Fay, we're only halfway. Bullshit! Fay! Bullshit! This running is total bullshit. Don't you wanna stay in shape? No. Come on, Fay. Blow it! I'm tired of suckin' in my stomach and pushin' out my boobs all clay long. Who's lookin' anyway? Plenty of people. Name 10. Come on in the water, you'll love it. God, I hate that. It's so dumb. What? You don't like them, with their Clairol and their little cliques and their special words? "Bitchin', man. "You know." "Gnarly. "For sure." Honey, surfers are the Shriners of the beach. But we can't disappoint them. Come on, we gotta keep in shape for the Shriners. Yoo-hoo, surfer boys! Hey, bitchin', man. Your brother was good. Pretty snappy dolls, huh? Well, the young one's my daughter. The older one's my ex-wife. Corky's stepmother. You get any funny ideas in your head, you better forget 'em. You stayin' with relatives? I mean, you got people out here? I got a room in my house, I just, you know, kinda store stuff in but if, uh, you'd like to bunk there for a clay or two, you're welcome. Really? Sure. ♪ Hear the music start to go ♪ ♪ Comin' at ya let it flow inside you ♪ ♪ Everybody's dancin' ♪ ♪ Now it's movin' nice and slow ♪ ♪ Gonna get ya, just let go ♪ ♪ Surrender ♪ ♪ Everybody's dancin' ♪ Is that okay?

We ought to go to Rincon. Hi, Marsha. Hey, Tenner, wanna go to Rincon? No, there's too many kooks. Not at Rincon. Anybody wanna go to Rincon? Did you hear about the Borrego Beach contest? They increased the first place money to 2,000 bucks. Huh, I wonder what I'll buy with that. Forget it, Chapman, that's my ticket to Hawaii. Oh, you going to the islands, Tenner? Yeah, for the winter surf. Mmm. That'll be great. Stephanie'll be there at the same time. Yeah, won't that be fun? Spike it, spike it. A little help? I can't stand it. The virgin princess. She'll never get laid as long as her old man's around. Doesn't anybody wanna go to Rincon? I don't care if his brother was John Philip Sousa! It's my last month here. You promised we'd spend some time together. It's just until he fulfills his spiritual mission. So, play the damn record and send him back to the Windy City. Corky, Corky, my clear! A young man with a horn. A career, nay, a life, tragically truncated. A loss we all must bear. Well, I think I can bear it. Just like your stepmother. No music, you know. No romance. Great tits, though. Duke! Uh, I'm just thinkin' out loud. Well, I'll tell you one thing, I'm not gonna be the one who cleans up after him. Of course not. Or cooks for him. I'm sure he'd never ask. Maybe you could kinda take him around with you, show him the ropes? The hell I will! Why don't you? He's your age. He's a wimp! He's got a dumb haircut, he's not tan, he wears stupid clothes, he's icky! Hi. What's for dinner? Good morning. Time to hit the heavies. Yeah. Fay, my Hawaiian lei. That was funny, Rick. Thanks. When you goin' to the islands? Any clay now. That's what you told me last year. Rick! Hey, Corrine, I love the way you held my onions. Next time, he wants you to hold his pickle, too. You guys are so gross! "You guys are so gross!" You are, you know? "You are, you know?" Earl? Earl? Mmm, got the flowers on today. Earl Fescue. Oh, you are so gross. I've seen 'em plenty of times. Oh, really? Well, maybe you don't need to see 'em anymore. Oh, shoot, Cor. Hi, Jordy. Corrine, Corrine, short order angel. God's gift to a hungry man. Just got 15 coats of lacquer on her last week. Oh, It's so choice, Jordy. I think you really need a car like this, Corrine. Don't you think she'd look fantastic driving around in a car like this, Earl? Uh-huh. Go ahead, Corrine, sit in it. Oh, Earl. It's so cherry. Sure is a fine short, man. Go ahead and sit in it, Earl. Don't hand me no paper bags, man. It's just my lunch, Ruben! I don't know what's in there. Could be trouble. It's a double cheeseburger, fries, and a malt. Okay, okay. As long as I know. Oh, Earl, don't you just love It? Man, if I had a car like this, I'd just drive and drive. I'd never stop! You gotta stop for gas. Yeah, but I'd stay in it, see. Fill her up, buddy, and roll on out. A guy could live in a car like this. Hey, you know, man, we could really cherry this son of a bitch up. Nose it, deck it, french the tail lights, two times the pipes. Louver the hood, tuck and roll the interior. It could look so fine! You know. Earl, I've always admired that Pontiac of yours. A real classic, in the making, you know? Huh? Geez, man, this car's a bitch. It's got the V8 mill, bored and stroke with bully rings, roller rockers. Exactly. Exactly. A classic. Which has got me into thinking, I'd like to own a car like that. It's one of a kind. Now, you like this car, right? And I like your car. Maybe we could work something out. Oh, um, my car ain't worth a third of what this car is worth. Oh, I wasn't thinking of a trade. More of a kind of bet. A challenge, really. Yeah? Yeah. A test of stamina and endurance. A test of staying power. You stay in your Pontiac till Labor Day and the 'Vette's yours. You leave it, anytime before, for any reason, and I get your wheels. He means it, Earl. If you don't think you can do it- Can't do it? You're on. Hey. What is that? It's what everybody wears to the lake. Oh, God, where'd you get it? Freesley's on 4th and Sycamore. Oh, come on, I gotta get on the list if I'm gonna play today. I won't get in your way, I promise. All right, just walk behind me. Mr. Slusarski. Mr. Slusarski, are you mad at me? Aw, no, you're here now, and you gotta show 'em what you got. Nice serve! Geez. There's banana bread for dessert. Hear that, champ? Banana bread. For el grandebanana. Great, did you make it?

This time you're gonna pay for damagin' my place, or I'm callin' the cops. But I didn't do anything. Welcome aboard. I finally found one of these little schmucks peepin' in my place. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is Bart Tobline from TV News 6 here at Womack's Garage, witnessing the most exciting event that has occurred at State Beach in many a year. The windows have been barred. The doors, sealed. Even the trunk has been welded shut as a stipulation in this unusual wager. Earl Fescue, a gas station attendant from Venice, California, will literally be the prisoner of his own automobile for the next month and a half. Let's cut it, Charlie, and move the cameras over there. Excuse me, kid. You know I'm gonna see you every clay. And I'm gonna bring you all your meals, and I'm gonna do your laundry. Aw! Well, it's the least I can do, hon. You know, considering all that you're doing for us. Piece of cake! Six weeks from now, you and me are gonna be tooling around in that 'Vette with four on the floor. And I'm gonna be waiting for you, honey. Just waiting for the clay they cut you out. Psst! Psst! Hey, man, you get too crazy in there, I know a chick who'll do you through the bars. Ruben! Coming through, Corrine! Cowabunga! Had about six of these already. Got plenty more where they came from, bro. You guys are real buddies. I didn't know I had so many real buddies. You won't leave me, will you, buddies? Well, when it gets gnarly, we'll be here, babes! I think I gotta go to the bathroom. And there's no way he can possibly get out? Not unless he gets one of these little mothers. Sorry, man, you know. I've gotta admit it, you did a really nice job. Thanks. How are you doing with that story of yours? Okay- Look, I'll try and get over and fix that hole in the wall tomorrow. And the sink. Damn, I gotta fix the sink. I had it fixed three months ago. You did? Well, when I get this tub finished, I'll have a lot more time, yeah. More time. Got a lot of things I've been meaning to do. Like what? Like, take a vacation, go somewhere. How can you take a vacation from a vacation? Oh, all right, that's good, Fay. I guess what it boils down to, everything's right here, right? I don't think so. I knew that. So, when you going to Hawaii? One of these years. Well, if you're still around when I finish this thing, I'll sail you over, free of charge. I know what you want. Yeah? What? Someone to row. Sure. Row. Hey, did I ever tell you I was in the Olympics? 1956, Helsinki. The Olympics? Uh-huh. Helsinki, 1956. Fish? Slusars. Screwed the entire Australian women's diving team the night before the finals, their 100 meters backstroke. Came fourth. I bet you did. Hey, look. See that? Anything for a dame, huh? Ruben, I'm going crazy in here! Hey, man, I'm gonna level with you, as your personal manager. Shoot. Buddy! You're gonna get rich! You got a career to think about. A career? In advertising! What we're developing here is the most important aspect of the game. Touch. It's all in the fingers. I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm just not from here! Look, boy, all I'm trying to do is develop your volleyball skills. Yeah, well, to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure I care to develop them. Oh, yes, you do! You know why? Ass! All I'm trying to do is get you some ass! You're standing on the A Court. No volleyball court in the country has the prestige of the A Court at State Beach! It is a privilege! Nay, it's an honor to play volleyball on the A Court. It's also a great way to get laid! No offense, boy, but you've been here for more than a month now, and you ain't had tit one, am I right? Develop your touch, learn to play volleyball. Anything can happen. Strength. Strength and sensitivity. That's how you touch the ball, and that's how you touch women. The more women you touch, the better your fingers get. More sensitive, see? The more sensitive your fingers are, the better you play volleyball. The better you play volleyball, the more women you get to touch! That's why volleyball's the world's greatest sport! Look at it! Hug it! Little chickies! I love it! Oh, kiss it! Love it! Hug it! Look at that little round thing comin' right up to you! It just bounces back. That's It! What are you doing? Practicing. Getting the ol' fingers in shape! Hey, you got lipstick up your nose. Where are you goin'? Got a hot date? It's none of your business. I think my fingers are beginning to get more sensitive, you know? Hmm, I'm sure. Got that ol' soft touch down pretty good now. Won't be long now before these fingers will be touching stuff left and, uh, right. Right. Yeah. T.T.? You wanna blow a number? Sure. What do you wanna hear? Hey, what's that stuff on your shoulder? Looks like you got dumped on. Hi. Hey. Jerry, that cop was lookin' at me, what am I supposed to do? Look cool. You just walk. Hey, who's that dorky kid?

Did anybody ever really surf on this? Did, George Freeth surfed on this board! You ever heard of George Freeth? Mmm-mmm. Well, some accounts mistakenly give Freeth credit for reviving the lost art of surf ridin'. However, I preceded Freeth by some eight months, surfing before a crowd at the Redondo Beach Baths one cold winter clay. I taught George Freeth how to surf, and this is the very board we used. Does it still float? Float? In those days, boy, we built things to last! Redwood! Solid! Do you feel it? Solid redwood! Borrego Beach is next week. Yeah, wanna go down a clay early. Check it out?

Oh, Daddy! We're having a party, invite him. Oh, thank you! Oh, Ricky, it's gonna be so beautiful. We'll be able to go everywhere together. Yeah, everywhere. Makaha, Makapuu, Waimea Bay, the Pipeline. Mmm. Jesus Christ. And you don't mind that Daddy wants you to come to dinner, do you? It's the only thing he asked from me. Hey, I can handle it. I'll put on my formal T-shirt and my tennies and just bomb right on through. No problem. Anyway, it's what, three weeks away? Mmm-hmm. Hi. Uh- Can I come in? She thought Mike was here. Oh.

Hell, George Freeth and me used to shoot the pier at Malibu. And Malibu's much harder to shoot than this. You could sail a goddamn freighter through here. Boy, I remember one rare, tropical storm. George and me, we were both in love with the same woman. Corky's mother. We had a- You guys gonna shoot the pier? Looks pretty gnarly. I don't know. Tenner wants to win the contest.

Blam! You follow her under a tree, like a snake. Then what? Wrestle. Them virgins love to wrestle. I wrestled a virgin once for three hours in the back seat of a '53 old Fiesta, with a Hirsch shifter, twin-deck magnetos with the gasket roller rockers. What happened? Did 143 in the quarter mile! And ET of 9.02! No, with the virgin! Oh, yeah. Well, she beat me twice, man. But it was worth it. I got some tit! Yeah? Bare? Almost! All right! Now's your chance! T.T.! Are you all right?

Yeah, me too. I guess I heard it about a million times. I'll get you another watch. You're leaving pretty soon, huh? Yeah, Monday. What are you gonna study? I don't know yet. What are you gonna do? Well, are you gonna be a trumpet player, or what? Yeah. I don't know. My watch isn't really very broken. Let me see it. It's ticking. Oh. I guess it fixed itself. Do you prefer extended foreplay or a more spontaneous coming together? T.T., why do you always manage to say something ridiculous? I read too many books, I think? Well, why don't you just be quiet for a while? No! I gotta go to the bathroom. Oh, Corky!

It's all in Finnish, but I know what it says. It's all about Duke being in the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. 200-meter backstroke. He finished fourth. See, it's signed by the President of Finland. He always lied and said it was 1956. He was so vain about his age. Can you believe that? The old dope! As if anybody cared how old he was! No. No! God, Jordy, what's the matter with you lately? Well, Corrine, to tell you the truth, I've been thinking it over, you know? I think maybe we've been seeing a little too much of each other. Maybe we ought to get out a little, see other people. Oh, what you're saying is you're tired of little Corrine. Well, you got what you wanted, didn't you? Your words, not mine. Okay, fine. We both got what we wanted. It's Labor Day. Earl's won your car! He's getting $25,000 besides, and I'm getting Earl and the car! Wise decision. Bet your ass! Please, no more bets! What in the hell? Okay, now bring it over. Bring it over. Come on! Come on!
