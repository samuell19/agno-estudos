(upbeat music) (hands clapping) (upbeat music) (crowd applauding) - They're good, but I need more cowbell. (birds chirping) (gentle music) - Hey boys. - Hello Mr. Robert. - [Robert] You sounded wonderful. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Hello everybody. - [All] Hello ma'am. - You just keep getting better and better. You're gonna win a competition someday. - Thank you Miss Violet. - Thank you ma'am. - Your mother would be so proud of you boys. God rest her soul. (gentle music) Now where is that father of yours? - He's right here ma'am. (gentle music) Pa, you see us play? - Hey, I heard you coming down the hill. It sounded great, what I heard. I'm sorry boys, I was working on my machine and I lost track at the time, I'm so sorry. - Well you should've seen it, when they were dancing and clapping, it was so fun. - You must be so proud of you boys and what you doing, raising them without their mother. - Miss. Violet, it's good to see you ma'am. It's a wee bit hard, five bachelors living under one roof. But all right boys, one competition each this year. That's it, nothing more. Do you understand? - [Boys] Yes, Pa. - And Father McKenzie said he would visit with me. It's very important. - Pa, don't go, you'll miss us. - I'll do my best to get back here before you start. In the meantime you have fun. Don't get in trouble. But if you do get in trouble, stick together. Do you hear me? - [Boys] Yes, Pa. - Boys. (speaks in foreign language) All right, go and have fun then. Robert, keep an eye on them for me, would you? - I will. (birds chirping) - What was that you were saying at the end? - Oh, that was Latin. Angela insisted that they learn it. I said, guardian angel. And they said, "Watch over us." - Oh. - It's something that she used to say to them. I've just kept it up. (birds chirping) - [Violet] I don't like the man. It's just something not right there. - Ah, Jethro Hawkins, he's been very sick. Makes him a wee bit taller hey. - O'Neal, I can't believe a man such as you is wasting time on something like this. - Yes, Sir. My sons aren't a waste of time. They're playing and they're gonna be in a competition in a little bit, so it's important to me to be with them. - Miss Violet, would you care for a ride in my carriage? (dramatic music) - No, thank you. (birds chirping) - Well that'll teach the old buzzer to ask someone of your character to ride with him and carriage, won't it? - Thank you Mr. O'Neal. (car engine revving) - [Josiah] Look it over, look at the date. 2015. - You're playing with fire. I've told you before. It's against nature. This is not how God made the world to work. - Father, you believe in miracles, right? - Of course. - Why can't I have a miracle? Why can't I have a bundle of miracles? - If God wanted Angela here, he could have kept her from dying, but he didn't son. Pain, heartache, suffering, loss, they're all a part of our redemption. Even when we don't understand, even when we think we can't bear it. (gentle music) You've got to understand and accept this, Josiah. - No Father, I won't. I've already been there in about seven times. I've just gotta figure out how to get from there back to her sick bed with the medicine, then I can save her. I want my Angela back. (gentle music) - I don't want to be uncharitable, Josiah, but Jet Hawkins has a bad reputation. - He's got good credit and he's helped me to purchase all the items and the materials that I need to make this machine. - You need more wisdom than credit son. I don't have a good feeling about this. The sooner you accept Angela's death and stop risking your life, the safer you and your boys will be. And what if you go and never return? What would happened to those boys? - I don't know, Father. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Congratulations, young men, y'all have the finalist and the four competitions that we will have today. Competition with the long gun, the pistol, the hatchet. And when it's time for the bow, you will bring your bow forward.

Lemme see that bow. This is nice. I think I'll keep it. - Give it back. (birds chirping) - Gentleman, gentlemen. It appears you have foolishly commenced in a violent quarrel with our sibling. The bonds of filial loyalty require that we assist said sibling with greater force until we prevail, and you are driven from the field. Veni, vidi, vici. (birds chirping) - What does all that mean? - Roughly translated, you're a moron. You started a fight with our brother and now we are going to whip your tail. - Oh really? 'Cause it seems that there's more of us than there is you. - That's what makes it fair. (birds chirping) - All right, everyone stop now. That's it. Not another punch. Get up. Get up. (birds chirping) Go to your parents, right now, go. (birds chirping) - You better check on those nephews of mine, they were just in a fight. - Oh, grief, for the love of Pete. I'm sorry, thank you, I'll deal with them. Boys, what did the name of creation is going on here? - There was a big boy, picking on Josiah, he was trying to take his bow. We did what you told us. - All right then, I'm proud of you. Each of you, get your instruments and get to the top of the hill, I'll be with you in a minute. Go now, go. - Yes, Pa. - Yes, Pa. (birds chirping) - I need to tell you, when I was there last, I met someone who's very interested in our work and wants to help us out. - What? No one there is supposed to know anything about what we're doing. - I know, I know. He saw me get out and he started asking questions, I had to explain. - No, you didn't have to tell him anything. You know the kind of trouble that cause us. - Don't fuss so much. Well be all right. (birds chirping) - Oh, I hope so. - If this goes well, you can make a lot of money. - I'm not doing this for the money. I'm doing this to get me wife back and to help your father get well, you understand? - Yeah. - All right, I'll see you in a couple days. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) Well, I'm proud of you boys. You didn't start the fight but you stuck together. You did the right thing. And hopefully you taught those boys a lesson. And I'm proud of you how you did with your music and with your competitions. - But you didn't see us. - You missed me winning at archery. - And you missed us playing our music. - You're just missing too much, Pa, you're not there for us. Not like when Ma was here. - I'm working on this machine so that I can change our situation. If you just understand what I'm trying to do. (gentle music) You've got a quarter hour, each of you, to write in your journals, now go. (gentle music) (insects chirping) (gentle music) - How did he react? (gentle music) - He was angry. He's going back tomorrow, so, hopefully he'll meet our man and see it our way. (insects chirping) - What if he don't see things our way? (gentle music) What if he don't come back? - Let's hope that doesn't happen, Pa. - Are you sure you can operate that machine without him? - Yes, Sir. I've used it twice now, completely on my own. - What about the boys? If O'Neal don't come back, they'll start digging through things, asking questions. They might find something. - So what? They're just boys. - Boys that are trouble. (dramatic music) Big trouble. We're not going to let Josiah O'Neal or those four boys stop us from getting a proper return on our investment. (dramatic music) Do you understand me? (dramatic music) - Yes, Sir. (insects chirping) - [Josiah] Josiah, it's time for the bed, son. - Coming. (birds chirping) - Boys, please everyone settle down. All right, before we pray, tomorrow morning, I have to take one more trip. - Ah. - Please, Pa. - Stay here. - I understand. Please, I promise you this, it'll be me last trip. I'm working hard on machine boys and if and if things work out the way I hope, our lives are going to be very different. Do you understand me? - Yes, Pa. - Yes, Pa. - All right, let's say our prayers. - [All] In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, amen. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - Mr. O'Neal. (birds chirping) - Who the devil are you? How'd you know me name? - Surely Robert told you about me. I'm your new business partner. - We won't need any business partners, thank you very much. - I'm just saying we can do an awful lot of good with the money we can make from that machine of yours. - No. It wouldn't be right. Be like cheating. - Like you're trying to cheat death to get your wife back. - It'd be better if you didn't bring me wife into this. - Robert was afraid you were going to say that. - I'd rather give up this machine and give up all hopes of seeing me wife again than to see this in the hands of men, the likes of you, Sir. (dramatic music) - And I was afraid you were gonna say that. (dramatic music) You can take me back with you or join your wife. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Go. Go. (dramatic music) Help me, sweet Jesus. I've got to warn me sons. (birds chirping) - Come on Allan. - What's the place? - Come on. Come on, you got this Allan. - [William] Get on him, come on. - I'm good. - Boys, I've been shot. - Pa. You're a shot, are you gonna die? - We need to get you to the hospital. - Josiah, go get the buggy. - No, no, no, no, no, listen to me. I've got one way to save my life. You boys stay here. If Robert comes by, do not tell him that you saw me. Do you understand? - [All] Yes, Pa. - Don't tell him I was bleeding. Don't tell him anything. Do you hear me? - Okay. - Yes, Pa. - All right. And stay out me shed. I know a place that I can go now. I love you, pray for me. (dramatic music) - Buddy. you okay? - I've been shot. - Call 911. (dramatic music) - Pa came home shot. We don't know where he is. We don't even know if he's alive. - Yeah, I'm with Allan, we have to go. - Robert's here. - What? We can't let him see us. - Out back. (dramatic music) - No. Pa told us we cannot go in there. - We gotta hide from Robert somewhere. (dramatic music) - Wow. This must be what Pa was working on. - [Theodore] What is it? (dramatic music) - Hey, what are you doing? Don't touch that. (dramatic music) (all screaming) - Boys, boys, I know you're back here. Come on. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - We just did an x-ray to make sure there were no bullet fragments. He should be fine in a couple of days. He had no ID, but he did have these coins. (dramatic music) And he had an old suitcase with a lot of weird stuff. - Whoa, my dad collected coins. These are with a lot of money. Give me a call when he wakes up. We need to find out who he is and who shot him. - Will do. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (all screaming) - Where are we? - Pa. - What happened? - What are we? - Pa, Pa. - What's all this junk, where are we? - Are we in hell? - We are not in hell. (birds chirping) Look at this wheel. Look at this iron. They're some sort of automobiles. - I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to look for Pa.

Now get off my property. And I don't ever wanna see you here again. - Can you please tell us which way town is, Sir? - Town's that way, now go. (dramatic music) - Pa, Pa. - What's wrong, son? - We've got a problem. - So you think that O'Neal and the boys are at the other location. - That's the best as I can figure. Josiah hasn't come back and the boys are gone. - I'll tell you what you're going to do. You're going to go back to the future. If you find O'Neal, I don't want him or the boys coming back here. You understand? - O'Neal's my friend, and they're just boys. - None of that matters. I don't think you understand the significance of this. Find them all, make sure they never come back here. Am I clear? (dramatic music) - Yes, Sir. - So in summary, to travel forward in time, we would need a black hole. This would create a time dilation were minutes would become hours or vice versa. To go back in time, we would need two black holes, that would create a wormhole. (class laughing) - Keep it down. - However, the gravity of this wormhole would be so severe that it would collapse and crush a human. That's why we would need what scientists call, an exotic matter. - Bill and Ted's stupid adventures. - Quiet. (class laughing) - Would you two idiots be quiet, this is interesting. - As I was saying, we don't know what the exotic matter would be comprised of, but the person who discovers it will change the course of history and take the first ride on the Einstein-Rosen bridge.

I am delighted to be in the presence of so refined young lady. (both laughing) - You guys are funny. My name is Lady Guinevere and I am honored to be in the company of such gallant knights. - I'm a knight. - Can you take us to South Main Street? - Sure that that's the street, I live on. All right, well it's about four or five blocks up and around. Let's go. - I'll go. - Did you see anything in the sky, earlier today? - Yeah, the Blue Angels. - Oh. - What? - Blue Angels? - Or demons. - I'll have to call you back. What the heck is going on? - What? - There were four boys here, the O'Neal boys. - Dang it. - [Crane] What's the plan? - Pa said we can't let any of 'em get back to 1908 and we need to get that machine. - Your Pa's a wise man and a good business partner. If you need to make something disappear, I've got plenty of trunk space out back. (dramatic music) Now you go find those boys and get that time machine. (birds chirping) - This is our house. - [Gwen] No it's not your house. - Yes, it's. - No it isn't. - What did you do to our house? - I didn't do anything. - The shingles are falling off. - Hey, hey, hey, slow down. - What you do? - No, no, no. You're not allowed to come inside my house. - Who are you say that can't go in our own house. - What? Where are you going? Michael. - What is going on? Pa. - Your pa is not here. This isn't your house. - This is our home and we are not leaving. - Then I'm calling the police. - Well, go ahead, the sheriff's our uncle, he's been sheriff since R2. - Since when? - [All] R2, 1902. - What year do you think it is? - [All] 1908. - No, no, no, no, no, it's 2016. - What, that's crazy. It's 1908, and we got a picture of President William up on my wall, in our room. - Hold on. There might be an explanation for this. Our Pa's an inventor, he's been working on a machine. We went into the shed, we turned it on and there was a flash. We come out into a junkyard and if these two are right, we're in our town, in our home, more than 100 years in the future. (gentle music) - That is so cool. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. See, I've been studying about the Theory of Relativity and Einstein and wormholes, black holes. - Michael, shut up. This is not time travel. - Oh yes it is. And they're living proof. - No, they're not. They're just four boys playing some sort of prank or practical joke, probably set up by you or one of those idiot boys you hang out with. - I do not hang out with idiots. - Michael, allow me. Lady Guinevere, we apologize in advance for any inconvenience or disruption that may occur from our extended stay in your domicile. - I don't think so. You guys aren't staying here. - No. This is our house and we are not going anywhere. - Oh, I say otherwise because I actually legally own this house. - What?

How'd you get my bow? - That is my bow. - No it's not, I had my initials carved in right here. - You know what? Give me the bow. Give me the bow. My grandfather gave me this bow. - What was his name? - His name was Josiah Joseph Patrick O'Neal II. - That's my name. - Mr. O'Neal, these boys are from the past. They were all born in the late 1800s. - Is this candid camera? Is there a camera here somewhere? Are you, I know what's going on, you're in some class and you wanna see what happens to old people when you push them too far. - Sir, we're not playing a game. - Or a prank. - And we're not trying to get anything from you.

I've got four young men here that insist that their father has been shot. Got any report of a male who's been shot, gun shot. Excuse me?

They're staying with a relative in town, in the same house they grew up in. - You just stay with those boys. - I mean, they're not going anywhere, there's no time machine. - Well, you know Pa wants 'em back. He'll build another time machine. - All right, I'll be in touch.

I'm Allan, this is my brother, Theodore. We're staying with family while my dad's away on a big project. - What kind of project? - I'm not allowed to say you ma'am. - [Teacher] Because? - I'm sorry, that's all I'm allowed to say. - All right, have a seat. - Definitely CIA, probably a sniper or something. - Yeah, whatever. - Alrighty class, today we have two new students. Boys, would you like to introduce yourselves? How about you first, Josiah? - Hello, my name's Josiah O'Neal. We're staying with Gwen, she's family. - Oh, where are your parents? - My mom passed away. My dad's, he's on a mission. - Is he military? - No ma'am. - What kind of mission? - It's the family business ma'am. - Drug dealers. - How about you Theodore? What's your favorite football team? - I don't know what that is, ma'am. - Well, what about your favorite TV show? - I don't know what that is either, ma'am. - All right. How about your favorite book? - "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" ma'am, by Jules Verne. - And your brother, William? - [William] Ma'am. - What kind of books do you like to read? - I love G. A. Henty, as an author. He's just great. And, "Famous Men of Rome" by Petard, that was great. And the, "Iliad & Odyssey" by Homer. But that Medusa, the snake haired girl, she really gave me a fright. - What about like, "Harry Potter?" - Who? (class laughing) - You know the, "Harry Potter" series? - I've never heard it, ma'am. - You speak Latin? - Yes ma'am. (upbeat music) - Tell us something in Latin. (speaks in foreign language) (gentle upbeat music) I agree, it is a nice day. Welcome to Trousdale. - I hear your dad's a CIA sniper. - What? - I'm the guy you need to worry about, okay. Just remember in this school, kids fear me. I'm like the plague. - Oh, okay, I hope you feel better. - [Josiah] Boys, come on up. - Whoa, how'd you get our beds? - Well, they were up in the attic. They recovered with bat poop and dust and. No, no, no, I spent half the day cleaning them, the other half putting 'em together. I know that this isn't home. I'm just doing everything I can to make this feel more like your room. Even though it is your room, which is really weird. Let's put some boy stuff on the walls and make this into the guy room, okay. (upbeat music) (upbeat music) - Your education is built on three concepts, tolerance, diversity, and say with it me kids. - [All] Multiculturalism. - We will not tolerate intolerance in this classroom. Josiah? - Just like Jesus said, "Do unto others as you would have them do to you." - We're not gonna deal with religion in this classroom. - What? - We don't bring religion into this class. - Surely you don't mean I can't quote Jesus when using reason and logic. - We don't discuss religion in this class. - Can we quote Lincoln or Washington? - Of course. - When they quote the Bible? (class laughing) - Don't get smart with me, young man. - I didn't mean any disrespects ma'am. But Ms. Hamilton said that without the Bible, without Christianity, there would be no America. It's the foundation. - Who's Mrs. Hamilton? - She's our history teacher from back in 190, home. - Well I'm not Mrs. Hamilton and this is not back home. Do you understand? (gentle music) - May I read this? It's from George Washington. - Fine, make it quick. - "Reason and experience will forbid us "to expect that national morality." Like what we've been talking about. "Can prevail in exclusion of religious principle." - You're treading on thin ice, young man. - You don't show much tolerance for the commands of Christ, do you? - That's it. Go to the principal's office. (gentle music) - Is that Josiah's journal? - It is. He told me I could read it. Tell me about your dad. (gentle music) - He's late for things. He misses things. He's always preoccupied with something that he's making. He's just not the same as he once was. Before our momma died, he would always be there. - Sounds like a man who lost his queen bee. - What? - A man who lost his queen bee. (gentle music) I wanna show you something. (gentle music) You're about to see what thousands of bees look like when there's a queen around. - Are we gonna get stung? - Maybe you are. (Josiah laughing) Don't worry, you'll be fine, come on. (birds chirping) Now the honey actually seals it. Ooh, look at that, wow. This is what a healthy hive looks like. Feel how heavy that is with all that honey? This hive has, you guessed it, the queen. (gentle music) Come over here. This one is gonna be kind of sad, okay. - [Allan] What's wrong with this hive. - [Josiah] You can see here, they've got a little bit of movement, they've got no order, they've got no queen. ♪ I've heard time heals all wounds ♪ - [Josiah] She's dead, she ran off. ♪ I'm not sure that's true ♪ - [Josiah] And the hive is dying. ♪ 'Cause I've done everything I know what to do. ♪ - I feel that, I feel like that might be what happened to your dad. ♪ I've cried a thousand tears ♪ - When your wife died. ♪ Look at all my fears ♪ - Is that what happened to you? ♪ But it still hurts ♪ - What a question.

(gentle music) Yes, that's it. (gentle music) Angel of mercy, please, please, let this find its way there. (gentle music) - I don't know what to do. I sold all the coins I brought with me. I'm about outta money. - Son, you're confusing me with someone who cares. - Mr. Crane. - Look, we have a deal. You follow those four boys and bring me that time machine. If you can't hold up your part of the deal, you and I may have a problem. The next time you and I talk, it better be because you've got what we agreed to. - Yes, Sir. - Hey there. - Is that your dad? Where is he? - He's in Japan. He's stationed as a pilot. - Why are you with G Pa? - Well, my mom and dad thought that it would be better for me to stay here to finish up the school year. And since grandma died, grandpa was really lonely. - [Josiah] Don't listen to her, she's making up stories. - Grandpa. - The reason that she's here is 'cause she was failing every single class. - That is not true. - And her mom and dad were terrified that she was gonna be in school forever. They begged me, "Please take our daughter, please." - That is not true. - I trust her. (all laughing) - Hey, I've got a surprise for you. Check this out. This is totally old world, forget that thing. Check this out. Do you recognize that fella? - [Josiah] That's me. - Sure is. - Who's the girl? - That young lass is Elizabeth. She's the lady that you ended up marrying. - I don't know an Elizabeth. - [Josiah] Well, you met her when you were 12-years-old. - I am 12. That means, I meet her this year. - Yes it does. (dramatic music) - Guys. Guys. (dramatic music) - Wow. This is amazing. - Look, Michael, we just wanna know, can you build this or not? - I think I can. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. (dramatic music) (people speaking indistinctly) - Where is my money? - I hate this place. - I wanna go home. - Guys, just think positively. - I'm positive we need to finish that time machine. - Before we leave, there's some things we need to take care of. (people speaking indistinctly) (both laughing) - [Student] Give it back. - If you can reach it. Oh. (dramatic music) - Thanks, Theodore, that was awesome. - I wish I was big enough to do that. - Big enough, you don't have to be big enough. - Just be ready to fight, win or lose. - "You can hang together or you'll hang separately." Ben Franklin said that. What are they teaching you here? - That George Washington owned slaves. - That Thomas Jefferson was a hypocrite. - That most of the world's problems are caused by rich white men. (all laughing) - It's all more complicated than that. But I'm talking about the Revolutionary War, how the picked-on Americans beat the British bullies and how you, we, can beat the Trousdale bullies. - So you think we could beat them? - Eventually, yes. But you have to be willing to fight and get beat and fight again until they stop fighting. - What if I don't wanna fight? - Then you are in a heap of trouble. They're going to keep picking on you and taking your stuff until you defend yourself. - If you wanna end this crap or at least cut it back, you have to stick together. Our Pa said that if one of us is in a fight, then we all better jump in that fight and teach that bully a lesson. - George Washington lost more battles in the Revolutionary War, than he won. He was constantly on the run. You heard of him crossing the Delaware River, right? But he wasn't sneaking away so could avoid fighting, he was sneaking away so we could fight on his own terms. - What are you guys doing? (dramatic music) - Oh, hey guys. I was just telling him about George Washington, how he beat the British, even though they were bigger and stronger, like you guys. - Whatever. Maybe we can have a little play time outside. You can pretend to be George Washington and run away and I'll pretend to kick your butt. - That sounds like fun. I love play acting. - Ooh, we could be in costumes. We could dress up like Paul Revere. You can be the Red Coats. - Yeah. - Shut up, you little twerp. - Hey jerk, you and I can go outside, right now, just the two of us. Or you can leave us to our little history lesson. (dramatic music) - You guys go back to your little happy time with these weirdos, we'll see you around. (people speaking indistinctly) - That was awesome. - What do they teach you guys where you're from? (all laughing) - So let's talk a little strategy.

But I don't have all the parts and it would at least take me $800. (birds chirping) - Hey guys, where's Josiah? - He's at Michael's house. - Okay, listen, G Pa, look, look what we're having at school. - Whoa. - Can we do it? - Battle of the Bands. My band and I did this a few years ago. Won some good money? We could do it. We could do, do you wanna do it? - Yes. - Yes. - What in the world would you possibly do with a thousand dollars?

And I just thought, oh he's dying and his mind is starting to slip. I didn't think about it. And between asleep and awake this morning, I remembered and I thought, that's it.
