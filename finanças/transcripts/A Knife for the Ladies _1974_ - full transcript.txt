(dramatic music) (whooshing) (electronic beeping) (horse neighing) (footsteps) (horse neighing) (horse neighs) (wind whistling) (water splashing) - Tomorrow's my night off. Maybe I can stay a little longer Miss Lettie. - Talk to me tomorrow. - Night Miss Lettie. (door thuds) (wind whistling) (footsteps) (floorboard creaks) - Damn it Amos I told you to go home. (gasps) (screaming) (eerie music) - [Man Voiceover] Dear Mr. Burns, permit me to introduce myself, my name is Simeon Hollyfield, president of the Mescal City bank. I am taking the liberty to come to see you regarding a matter of extreme urgency. During the past several months our once peaceful town of Mescal has undergone a series of strange events. - Three murders? But your letter only mentioned two. - The night before I left Lettie Mills, a girl who lived in the hotel, she was stabbed just like the others, horribly. - Mr. Hollyfield, how does your bank figure into all this? - Two years ago we were one of the major copper centers in the Arizona territory but the mine played out and now we're a small town getting smaller. Banks need people to stay in business. - Do you want me to solve the murders or save your town? - You asked me a question I answered as best I could. Obviously I wasted your time Mr. Burns and mine. - I simply meant that I can only help you solve the murders. Shall we begin? Who were the other victims? - A few months ago Travis Mescal, his family founded the town, was savagely knifed to death. Three weeks later a young girl from the saloon was killed in the same way. - How much authority would I have? - All you need, I have the town council's permission. - And my fee? - Well I've stated the town's financial position but Travis's mother has posted a $500 reward and we'll take care of your expenses. The fee will be commensurate with your effort and further I personally will give you a letter of recommendation when you leave. - Mr. Hollyfield it's poor pay. But a rich challenge, I'll be there by week's end. - Oh ah one more thing, you have to reckon with our sheriff Jarrod Coldcord a two fisted bear of a man. I'll tell him your coming but if I know Jarrod he won't take it kindly. (door bangs) - Trust nobody! 18 years that I've been banging his wiping noses working around the clock and what do I get for it? A damn kick in the butt! A kick in the butt! You get a shine on that thing Seth you wash your hands good I don't need your ma hollering at me. (tapping) Damn kick in the butt. This ain't no place to get stuck. You get old enough son you just pack up and get out. - What's got you so mad Jarrod? - Hollyfield that's what. Seems he's bringing in some fancy detective name of Burns or something. Says I had two months in the case and ain't solved nothing. Well I'm only one man and two months ain't very long! - What'd you tell him? - Well that's just the nub of it, I can't tell him nothing. Damn. - Your buckles all shiny, see? - Go on boy I don't want you late for your fiddle lesson. Damn. (bangs) Damn. God damn that. (eerie music) (suspenseful chord) (eerie music) (suspenseful chord) (bell rings) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) - Evening Nina. - Another music lesson eh? - Yeah. (hooves clattering) - Hola Ramon. (speaking foreign language) (ticking) (violin and piano music) (ticking) - Is it time yet Miss Jenny? - Seth McGee there are only 60 minutes in an hour you've still got a couple to go. (violin and piano music) (ticking) (violin music) (ticking) (ticking) - Seth it's almost over then you can run back to Uncle Jarrod and his tall tales of the good old days. (violin music) (ticking) (screaming) (violin music) (ticking) Cheer up Seth you've got seven whole days til the next lesson. (suspenseful music) - Nina? Nina. Nina? (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! Jarrod! - Whoa there, take it easy son. What's wrong? - It's alright Seth I'm here. Is something wrong with Miss Jenny? - No it's Nina, something terrible! There's blood all over her. It looks awful. - Anybody else there? - Ramon, the horse trader he was there. - J.B. find doc Fairchild and get up to Nina's. I'll get some horses and meet you. (chattering) - You stay put son. - It was really terrible. She was all... (chattering) - I'll try these. (burps) (dramatic music) (chattering) - Your friend Jarrod, he's got his ass in a sling again. This time it's Nina Torres. - Well whoever killed her might of just buried sheriff Jarrod Coldcord. - Not so fast, does the name Ramon mean anything to you? - Yeah, Mex horse trader. - That's the one. That kid, Seth McGee he said Ramon did the killing. - Verde Canyon that's where the Mex makes his camp. Did Jarrod leave yet? - No, he went right out to Nina's house. (bangs) - Just like I figured. Any smart lawman would have gone right to Ramon's camp. And that's right where I'm headed. Get this place straightened up, business is gonna pick up around here. (dramatic music) (chattering) - [Man] Let's get the sheriff over here. - [Man] Here comes the sheriff. - [Man] Where's the sheriff? - This has gotta be the work of a mad man. (chattering) - [Jarrod] Alright be quiet everybody. - The boy saw her like this. - Alright settle down, be quiet. Somebody saw the killer, this time we know who it is. - Well knowing him and finding him aren't the same thing Jarrod. - Don't get smart Riley, I know exactly where to find him. (chattering) - Jarrod I'll go with you. - Fine. Anybody else wanna go with me come on, I'm going to Verde Canyon. (chattering) (dramatic music) - Alright everybody, go back to your homes. Go on home now. (dramatic music) About time Orville. - Dead is dead I reckon. My getting here any sooner wouldn't change that. She belongs to eternity now. (suspenseful music) - Horace, go over around that way. Lute circle around and come in behind him. Keep it quiet. (suspenseful music) (hooves clattering) - (speaking foreign language) You come for business? - No. I come to arrest you for killing Nina Torres. - Nina. No, I kill no one! - Stop lying, somebody saw you do it. - (speaking foreign language) You are not the sheriff! - Don't matter, I'm doing his job now mount up I'm taking you in. Come on get on your horse, let's get going. (snaps) Get him! Get him! (dramatic music) Get him down off of there! - [Lute] Get him Horace! (dramatic music) - Get him! (dramatic music) - Nothing Jarrod, not a God damn sign of him. - It's so dark out there you can't see 10 feet ahead. - Well keep looking he's gotta be around someplace. - Let's go home Jarrod. - This is his camp, you can see he's been here. - Did you expect him to stick around and fix you some beans Jarrod? (laughing) - Come back here God damn it. - Come on Jarrod we can head out first thing in the morning. - Lazy bastards. (dramatic music) - Mr. Burns, you better let me take 'em on in. - What's that? - Mascal coming up, you better let me take it from here. Whoa, hey. (dramatic music) - Hold it! - Whoa. (dramatic music) Whoa. (suspenseful music) - My God, welcome to Mascal Mr. Burns. You know him? - I ain't never seen him before. - Hell of a way to die. Will you help me cut him down? (dramatic music) - [Driver] Giddy up. (dramatic music) - Jarrod it's him Jarrod they brung him in on the stage. - Brung who in on the stage? - Ramon! (dramatic music) (chattering) - Mr. Burns. - Hollyfield. - Glad to see you here. What's going on here Burns? - Found him hanging from a tree outside of town. Driver told me it was Verde Canyon. - Well there's your killer Mr. Hollyfield. This time we got a witness. - He's the one I saw at Nina's last night. - Your killer was brought in by Mr. Burns here, found him hanging from a tree at Verde Canyon. - Well that don't change the facts none. He killed Nina, looks to me like he got what was coming to him. - Sheriff don't you believe that an accused man is entitled to a fair trial according to the law? - Don't preach the law to me Burns, I know the law! - The fact is some one took it upon himself to judge this man guilty. The law and order in this town is still your responsibility sheriff. - Here's that judge's rope. It's evidence. Start with that. - Now you listen to me Burns, I'm the sheriff in this town and I've been getting along fine without your advice, I'll find out who killed Ramon. In the meantime we've got the killer we've been looking for. - [Man] That's right sheriff. (chattering) - Well he certainly can't deny it. - Amos you take Mr. Burns bags, give him the best room there is. I suggest you settle down in the room and get started, I'll join you in a few minutes. - A little later Mr. Hollyfield, I have some necessary things to do first. (chattering) - Sheriff, you better be right about Ramon, it's along way to the next town and they already have a sheriff, a young one. Now get Orville over here and bury this man. (chattering) - That's telling him Jarrod. - Everybody go home and mind your own business, all of you! Go on! (bangs) (dramatic music) (eerie music) (bell rings) (eerie music) (door bangs) (eerie music) - A special scent Mr. Burns. Prized in the east and unappreciated in the west. - Mr. Aimsley, I'm here to ask you... - Needn't bother to explain, Mescal is but a tiny pool into which a very large stone has been dropped. I've been expecting your visit. - I'd like to see Nina Torres. - It's not a pleasant sight. But death never is. (suspenseful music) (dramatic chord) - Were the others killed the same way? - Exactly. - Do you believe Ramon killed Nina? - In this town Mr. Burns I'm not asked to make judgements I'm paid to prepare and bury corpses. - None the less I feel a man of your discernment must have an opinion. - This is a harsh country Mr. Burns with violent people and innocent victims. - Then in your opinion Ramon is not the killer? - A killer maybe, the killer? As I said I simply bury them. - Strange that a man of your profession has such little compassion. - Compassion? Do you think being a town undertaker is my life's ambition? I cut hair, I shave beards, and I bury people for one reason only, money. - Then you must be a wealthy man. - A poor joke Mr. Burns. In Mascal one exists, nothing more. - You have my sympathies. - And you have mine. A man of your skill could better occupy his time than trying to chase after the killer of three town whores. - Whores? - Well but then I suppose anyone's death is bad for business except mine. (dramatic music) - Those were the best days Mr. Burns. The town flourished then. The name Mascal was respected and revered. My husband's death eight years ago placed a tremendous burden on me and my son Travis. We had a great tradition to maintain. - And you've done splendidly. - Perhaps but a great portion of my life is only memories now. I used all our money to try to save Mascal but it didn't help. People drifted away slowly, first by wagon loads, then by train and then even the trains stopped. If only Julio were alive, with his strength and inspiration this town would survive. - Now Elizabeth the past's past, Mr. Burns is concerned with the present. - You're right Simeon, practical as usual. Well Mr. Burns I hear you're an exceptional investigator, at least so Simeon says. Do you think Ramon is the killer? - Mrs. Mescal answers are not easy to come by. - Nor is peace of mind. It's been several months since my Travis was killed and for me it seems like several years. - Do you feel there's any connection between your son's death and the others? - Indeed not. - Did he know them? - Them? Well Travis knew everyone, everyone knew Travis. He was young and handsome, he enjoyed people, he loved life. If Travis knew any of those women, well that was his affair. He had a passion for living. Which makes his death even more tragic. More tea? - No thank you. - It's just a little medicinal preparation to buoy my spirits. Dr. Fairchild insists I don't need them but I do find they perk my darkness. You see, outside of a few good friends like Simeon those that are still left ascribe the failure of the mine and the town to the Mescal family. - Oh Elizabeth you must-- - Nonsense! Nonsense. It's the truth, we both know that. - From what I can determine a definite similarity exists between all the deaths, now to me this indicates-- - It's getting late Burns. I am sure there are others you wish to speak to. We'll be going Elizabeth. - Well, if I seem mired in self pity, I'm sorry. It's unavoidable for me. - I thank you for your patience. I'll do everything possible to help. - Well if I can be of further assistance don't hesitate to call on me. Only the next time don't bring Simeon, he worries about me too much. - I won't. Goodbye. - Goodbye Mr. Burns. - Goodbye Elizabeth. - Simeon. - No need to show us the way. (suspenseful music) - Something she said about Travis bothered you didn't it? - Yes, no need hiding it any longer. You'll find out soon enough but the Travis she talked about never existed. - What do you mean? - I mean Travis used the Mescal name as a bedroom key, any woman was fair game for him. He drank, gambled and tossed the Mescal money around like, like each day was his last. - It seems to me like Travis had the money to buy friends and the talent to make enemies. - In three short years he destroyed a name that took two generations to build. - One more thing Mr. Hollyfield. - Huh? - When I'm questioning a witness I decide when I'm finished. (dramatic music) Good day. (suspenseful music) (cat meows) (suspenseful music) (horse neighs) (laughing) - [Burns] And that was it. (laughing) - Well when did you know you had him Burns? - As soon as the judge got his mouth around the word guilty. (laughing) (hooves clattering) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (hooves clattering) (suspenseful music) (goats bleating) (suspenseful music) (knife whacks) (dramatic chord) I didn't hear you come up. - I didn't come up I was already here feeding the stock. That's just a little warning for you. Out here it's best to cover your backside. - Why didn't you tell Ramon that? - If you're looking for Ramon's knife that's it. - This maybe Ramon's knife but it wasn't used to kill Nina. The slashes on Nina's body were made with a hooked blade. - What makes you so damned sure? - I examined the wounds, did you? Keep it or you can bury it with Ramon. Where was Nina murdered? - Well, it looked like it started over in there some place and she ended up here on the porch right there. - I'd say she put up a good fight. - Not good enough. What the hell's the difference Burns? She's dead. - So is Ramon. Where did you say the boy was when he saw the murder? - Well he was out there in the road. - Tell me sheriff, if Seth was standing here when he saw Ramon kill Nina, why didn't Ramon kill Seth too? I mean, he was a witness. - Well I guess it was dark out there. - You guess Mr. Coldcord? Being a good lawman takes more than just guess work. (dramatic chord) Hello? I'm Burns. - You calling my son a liar? - I am not saying your son is a liar. I'm only suggesting that maybe he was mistaken after all it was dark. - Dark or light my son said what he saw, I believe him. - Maybe if I talked to your husband-- - You'll have to find him first. Right now I'm Seth's mother and his father. If my son's made a mistake, and I'm not saying he has, it's an honest one. I'm not having some stranger hold my son up to ridicule. - Be reasonable Mrs. McGee. If the boy was wrong it could affect his entire life. - Most folks wouldn't have said anything. You try to do the proper thing you get no thanks for it. - You can't shut it out of the boys life. Now last night happened, the sooner you let him face up to it the better it'll be for him. - No. You have my answer Mr. Burns. Outside of you buying something we have no further business. (suspenseful music) (whistling) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) (horse neighing) - Jarrod. Jarrod. (snoring) Jarrod? (snoring) Jarrod! Wake up, please wake up! - Who is it? - It's me Seth. - Ah go away boy leave me alone. - No I gotta tell you something! It's something you've gotta know! - Go away and I'll talk to you in the morning. - No now! (coughing) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (knocking) - Yes? - [Seth] It's Seth McGee. - What is it son? - About Nina, I think I lied. I didn't really see Ramon kill her. - Come on in son. Let's talk about it. - What? Seth lied to me? - Let's call it a half truth. He saw Ramon with Nina before his lesson. After his lesson when he found Nina's body Ramon was gone. - You must be real proud of yourself. You made me look like a damn fool! - You brought it on yourself Jarrod. Strange you'd take the word of a 10 year old boy. - Seth had no call to lie to me! - Unless he was trying to protect ya. Whatever the reason doesn't matter now. Ramon was hung on Seth's word. - I didn't think of that. - That's your trouble, you never think. - Well now. I may not think straight all the time but one things very clear to me you've been on my back ever since you got here, now you're a very fancy man with the words. Let's find out what kind of a man you really are huh? - Jarrod, this isn't gonna prove anything. - Well maybe not but it's gonna make me feel one hell of a lot better. (whacking) (crying out) (coughing) - Mr. Burns you're a better man than I gave you credit for. - [Jenny] Uncle Jarrod. - Jenny I, we... That's investigator Burns. - How do you do? I'm Jenny Coldcord Jarrod's niece. I know why you're here. - I'm sorry about this. - [Jenny] Judging from your appearance I imagine you are. - Miss Coldcord things aren't always as they seem. - I know exactly what happened Mr. Burns I've seen it coming. I only regret you did nothing to avoid it. - Your uncle is caught in a web of new time and he's trying to stubborn his way out with his fists. - Despite what you may think Jarrod is a good man, he's given his life to this job all he knows is being sheriff without that he's nothing, your being here only reaffirms that. - I was asked to come here and do a job that needed doing. - Well then do it Mr. Burns only leave something of my uncle along the way. - Where can I find him? - Well, if he's not at home you can try the old train depot. (gentle music) (harmonica music) (coyotes howling) - This town sure had a lot of life once you should have seen it then. Trains whistling, people coming and going, I met every train in them days. Being sheriff really meant something. People had respect for me. It's all dying now and I'm just an old man with a tin star. Oh hell you don't care about that. - Kinda wish I'd been here with ya. I'll tell ya something, I can't fail anymore than you can. See I'm trying to build a reputation and you're trying to keep one. That sort of puts us on equal footing wouldn't you say? - No there's a difference. We find the killer you leave and I stay, after what's happened it ain't gonna be the same. - Why don't we find him first? (laughing) - By golly, we wasted a lot of time talking, let's get going huh? (laughing) By golly. - Say, where'd you learn to use a stool like that? - Oh at a tailor shop. - What's that got to do with it? - The shop was next door to a furniture store. (laughing) - I swear Jarrod I must've knocked you crazy. - It sure felt like it. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - Damn it all it wasn't my idea to go get Ramon! (spits) (clangs) I didn't know he was gonna break his damn neck. Besides he killed Nina didn't he? - Hold it Horace we're all in this together. So what are we gonna do Virg? - Nothing yet. - If being sheriff didn't mean so much to you this never would've happened. - You watch your tongue Horace while you still got one! - Well maybe he's right Virgil. Maybe there's more important things than being sheriff. - You shut your God damned mouth! (whacks) (cries out) I'll decide what's important to me alright. (suspenseful music) (gentle music) - You ain't sore about me pushing you around there in the jail last night are ya? - Not if you're not mad at me about not telling it right in the first place. - Hell no, we just didn't get our ends straight that's all. - Did you whip him? Mr. Burns, did you whip him last night? - Oh, well not exactly... - You can beat him can't you Jarrod? You can beat anybody if you want to can't ya? - Is it important whether I can beat him or not? - Sure, if it isn't important to beat someone why do you fight him? - Could you say that again? - If it isn't important to beat him why do you fight him? (laughing) - Seth boy, I've been trying to teach you things about living ever since you was old enough to hear and I'm sure proud to find out you've been learning faster than I was teaching. - Sir? - Come on, let's get over to the jail to see if there's some cleaning up needs a doing. (gentle music) (knocking) - Just a minute. - My name's Myra Lynn Mr. Burns can I come in? - Ah yes please. - Did you win or lose? - I win some and I lose some. How about you? - I never had a chance. Mr. Burns do you know Virgil Hooker? - Should I? - Well if you want the man that killed Ramon you should. - Hooker killed Ramon. - With his two friends Horace and Lute Dooland. - Well I don't doubt your word Myra but well, that's just what it is your word against theirs. Do you know what this is? - Yes, Lute Dooland wears conchs like that on his vest. - This could be what we need. Don't leave this room under any circumstances. You'll be safe here. (suspenseful music) - Why don't we just go over there and arrest him? - Not yet, we need more proof. - Well you just said they admitted hanging Ramon. - Not to me they didn't. - I tell you Burns you work so damned slow I sometimes wonder how you ever get anything done. - A French writer once said to know how to wait is the great secret to success. - Oh he did. Well that maybe alright for a writer but it ain't worth a God damn to a sheriff. - [Burns] Seth? - Yes sir? - I have a job for you son. (suspenseful music) - That McGee kid's coming this way. - I had my first drink when I was 10. (suspenseful music) - I'm looking for Lute Dooland. Detective Burns told me to give you this, he found it at Verde Canyon. (suspenseful music) - Well I'll be God damned! (suspenseful music) - How long we gonna wait? - I once had a case where a man was stealing from his own bank, I had to watch him day and night for five months before he made a mistake. - Five months, mmhm. (suspenseful music) - Lute why don't we just get outta here? - You ain't going nowhere. You leave now it's like admitting that we done it. - But we gotta do something, we just can't stay here. - It was your concho they found damn it. - We're going. - No you wait! You stand a lot better chance right here. - I don't see it that way Virg. We stay here we got no chance at all. If we get out of town at least they gotta catch us. - Lute if they could prove anything they'd be here by now. - Well if you're so sure of yourself why don't you stick around and see what happens. In fact wait until you become sheriff, then you can let yourself outta jail. - Oh no, oh no you... (guns firing) - That's what we've been waiting for. (guns firing) (dramatic music) Go to the front. - Right. (suspenseful music) - Hold it right there Hooker. - Get out of my way Jarrod I'm coming through. - You hung Ramon so I'm taking you in. Peaceable or flat out it's your choice. - Go away Jarrod, it's too late for you to be a hero. - That's your choice. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Myra? (suspenseful music) (dramatic chord) Oh my God. (eerie music) God. (eerie music) - The stab wounds were the same in all the cases, neat, precise punctures. Except where the flesh was pulled away by a ripping motion. - In your opinion then Myra was killed by the same person who killed Nina. - No doubt about it. The circumstances were all similar. - What can you tell me about Myra that might help? - Not much, that whole bunch from Hookers stayed to themselves most of the time. - Did, Travis Mescal ever go there? - Yeah when Hooker was my deputy he did. See Hooker kept getting him out of one mess after another. - Then Travis knew Myra? - Just as well as you wanna know anybody. - And the other women? - Same, none of them cared much who's bed they slept in. - Yeah when it come to women Travis knew 'em all. - How did Mrs. Mescal feel about his associations? - She's the one who has my sympathy Mr. Burns. With Travis her grief was in life as well as in death. She lost both ways. - When you examined Travis, were his wounds the same as the others? - I don't know. I never saw Travis's body. - Of course I saw Travis. How do you suppose I buried him? - Neither Dr. Fairchild nor the sheriff saw the body. Isn't that unusual Mr. Aimsley? - Perhaps, I was the first summoned to the house, when I arrived Mrs. Mescal was in a state of total despair she insisted that I handle all of the arrangements personally and privately. - You must have a very special relationship with Mrs. Mescal. - And why not? Does it seem so odd that I should attract a woman of her standing? - Not odd, unexpected. I was under the impression that you had no particular sentiment for anyone in this town and yet I sense a deep attachment to Mrs. Mescal. - Mrs. Mescal is a gentle lady, she understands me, I understand her. - As good friends should. - Eliz... Mrs. Mescal and I have a great deal in common. We all need someone. - Then you broke the law because of your allegiance to Mrs. Mescal. - Application of the law was always subverted where the name Mescal is concerned. - I'd always considered you a highly principled man. - Travis was horribly mutilated. His mother wanted him to be remembered as he was in life not in death. I simply granted her that wish. Is there a law against that? (suspenseful music) (bell rings) (suspenseful music) (dog barking) (horse neighs) (suspenseful music) (knocking) This is not a social visit Elizabeth. I'm afraid Mr. Burns has discovered our secret. - Oh? What have you told him Orville? - Nothing we haven't already told the others. Merely that I was the only one to see Travis's body. - Well then there's nothing to worry about. Certainly there's no harm in one friend helping another. - You have a point there Elizabeth. But one favor deserves another. I feel our little arrangement will have to be altered. - What do you want? - A slight fee for services rendered. - How much? - Just enough for transportation and expenses when the next stage leaves Mescal Elizabeth, I will be on it. (laughing) - Well why didn't you come to me sooner? I'd be more than happy to accommodate you. - Don't patronize me Elizabeth I'm not here for charity. This is an arrangement between friends. - As it should be. Here, this will help you to steady your nerves. I'll get the money. You know, in a strange sort of way, I shall miss you Orville, yes. (thunder cracking) - Damn it Jarrod that's the second time you've done that. - Guard your back side, remember? - What'd you find out? - Well our friend Aimsley went over to the Mescal place just like we figured. - Seems like we struck a nerve. (coffin scraping) (thunder cracking) - [Jarrod] I guess you know we're breaking the law. - This is in the pursuit of justice. - Well I ain't never done it before. - If it makes you feel any better neither have I. - I was at the funeral. The whole damn town was at the funeral. (thunder cracking) - It seems Simeon has hired the right man after all. Your thoroughness is only exceeded by your nerve Mr. Burns. - You still haven't explained why your son's body was not in the coffin. - Nor have you explained why you looked. - The fact that it was empty is reason enough. - Under the circumstances I, I feel I do owe you an explanation. My son had an inordinate fear of death and decay. He made me promise him that if he died I would have his body cremated. The remains of my son are in here. - Travis is in there? - That's right. (swallows) You have my permission to look if you wish. - No thank you. - I realize I deceived the town but I know they would never understand my son's wish to be cremated. - But you did perpetrate a hoax Mrs. Mescal. - You have no right to sit in judgment of my actions Mr. Burns. You were hired to find the man that killed my son and so far you have failed to do so. For some reason God has chosen me to outlive my husband and my son, without them I have nothing. When I die, the Mescal name dies. - I'm sorry we shouldn't have done that. - You're right Mrs. Mescal, I do have a job to do. (suspenseful music) - To you Myra Lynn, I offer a toast that we may both rejoice in our good fortune. To say that our presence won't be missed is an admission not of our failure, of their ignorance. (suspenseful music) (door creaks) They all laugh and taunt me because my ways are not their ways. You laughed at me too, you were no different than the others. Who are you to judge me? (whacks) (suspenseful music) Tomorrow as my last official act I shall lay you to rest in the morning (suspenseful music) May your life be on the far side of heaven be a better one. (suspenseful music) (dramatic chord) (crying out) - Doctor when did Mrs. Mescal first start taking this? - A few months. I can give you the exact date if you like. - Later. Tell me when she received her last supply. - One week ago to the day. - That supply is nearly gone. - Well that's impossible, I gave her enough to last a month. Are you sure? - When I arrived here four days ago her medication box was full, now it's practically empty. - Mr. Burns suppose she just put some in another container? - Suppose this medication, taken in larger quantities, served a purpose other than what it was intended for? - Medically speaking that is possible. - Then let's discuss and examine every alternative you can think of. - Alright, we know arsenic iodide is the main component. Let's see now. Ah here we are, arsenic in various compounds is commonly used to stimulate the metabolism in extreme cases of depression.
