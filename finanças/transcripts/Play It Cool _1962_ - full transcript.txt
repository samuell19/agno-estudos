Oh thanks, we'll do our best for you, and Pawley New Town when we get to Brussels. [Crowd] Here's to your trip. Here's to it. [Band] Yeah, here's to it. (bright orchestral music) (boys yelling) Blasted hooligans. (horn honking) (boys yelling) (upbeat swing music) Here look Billy, photographers! Thousands of 'em. Wonder who's coming? We are, man. Sure, I told the editor of the Pawley Gazette when we was leaving. What'd he say? He said as far as he was concerned, it wasn't soon enough. (upbeat swing music) Okay now, play it cool. Hey fellows, we've arrived! That's right, Billy Universe. And the Satellites. [Photographer] Go into orbit, son. [Photographer] I think this is them. Hey, come on, they're here. (photographers asking questions) Well how about that, then? Must be a film star or something. Yeah, but you'd think the Pawley Amateur Twist champions rated one picture. It'll be different when we come back from Brussels. Yeah, with the golden goblet and all! This ain't no bus! How terribly observant of you, officer. Get it in the car park. This lane's reserved for buses. Move it. [Photographer] Just one more please. [Photographer] Just hold it like that. How long are you going away for, Miss Bryant? Is it true you threatened to have Larry Grainger arrested, Sir Charles? [Reporter] Has Larry Grainger asked you to marry him, Miss Bryant? Well Larry Grainger be seeing you off, Ann? This way sir, the VIP lounge is ready for you. Just follow me. Hey, what are they all jumping around for? That's Ann Bryant, the runaway heiress. The one that went off with Larry Grainger? That's her. I don't blame her old man getting her away from that Grainger bloke, neither. Larry Grainger. He's the greatest, man. Yeah, six golden discs, dad. Yeah, at this very moment he's got two records on the charts. Yeah, would you let your sister marry him? I haven't got a sister. With his talent and money I'd let my mother marry him. (laughing) Thank you, very much. You can stay here, Sir Charles, until it's time to go the plane. I'll fetch you just before take off. Most obliged to you, Mister Briggs. I'm sorry about all this, Ann. But you'll thank me one day. You know, I am only doing it for your own good. I'll never forgive you, so there is nothing for us to say. You'll feel differently after a long cruise. Now, you'll be met in Brussels by Uncle Peregrine, and you will stay there until all this publicity has died down. Then he'll drive you to Amsterdam, and put you on board the boat, and I'll try and come over and see you before you leave. Don't bother. I know how you feel. And I know a damn sight more about this Larry Grainger than you do. He's not the man for you, or for any decent girl, for that matter. What do you know about...? Oh you might as well go, I don't need anyone to see me off. [PA Announcer] Anglo Amalgamated Airways. Angle Amalgamated Airways announcing... He charged me seven bob for parking. I nearly gave him the car for that. I told him we'd pick it up tomorrow morning. Okay. Who's got the tickets? Ring-a-ding. Right. Passports? Yep. How's that for sex appeal? Looks more like a commercial for a mop. The scales. Not you, the luggage. Now, who's got the tickets? Well, take them to the cashier and pay the airport tax. What do you want to weigh, then? Everything except your hand luggage. But it's all hand luggage. Well, that's not hand luggage, is it? Who said so? It's got a handle on it, ain't it? See, your scales broken it, now. I'm not parting with this, dad. I haven't finished paying for it yet. It'll have to be weighed whether you carry it or not. Hey, 37 and six, please. Eh? Airport tax. (whistling) Hey Billy! They want 37 and six for airport tax. We got it? You don't have to worry, Ring-a-ding, we've got all the money in the world. There you are. I hope you've got some money for when you get to Brussels. Oh that's okay, we're being met at the airport by the Belgium Twist Club. Besides, we're only going to be there one night. You see, we're gonna win a competition.

[PA Announcer] For immediate embarkation, all Anglo Amalgamated Airways passengers on flight number 107 to Brussels, to gate number five, please. I know air travel is here to stay, but even so I do think there ought to be a gentler way of getting from one place to another. About time. Here, what's all this queue lark? Maybe there ain't enough seats. Haven't you ever flown before? Well er, no. Well, you will be all right, I suppose. All of them so young. Here, what's he on about? Do you know which is the safest place in a plane? No. The toilet. It's in the back, you see. The last part to hit the ground. Exactly. We'll never all fit in there. Choose the back seats. Cool man, he's hitting the weed. Tranquillisers. Wowee, I wouldn't mind crashing with them three. [Alvin] Come on, let's get this stuff out. No, don't joke like that, you'll tempt fate. Yeah, well they can tempt me any time. Attention please, Anglo Amalgamated Airways. Anglo Amalgamated Airways announce the departure of their flight number 69 to Brussels. This is it. Passengers are requested to have their boarding cards ready and proceed to gate number five for immediate embarkation. Boarding cards, please. Can't I get Yogi? He'd only have to go into quarantine before returning into the country. I may never come back. Yogi and I will be waiting for you. Goodbye. Come along, first on get the best seats. (aeroplane overhead) (stewardess squealing) Well that didn't do us much good then, did it? I'm ready, I'm ready please. Would you mind going to the back sir, please? The back! Boarding pass, please sir. You're not taking all that on board as hand luggage, are you? Why not? We might do a bit of rehearsing on the way. This is our maiden flight, you see. Yeah, there's nothing like a good sing-song as the ship goes down. There you are, tempting fate again. You'll regret it, we shall all regret it. Looks like a bus, don't it? You can't trust these charter flights. All fares please. [Alvin] No standing on the lower deck. [Freddy] Hurry along now, please. Hold tight, ding ding. Oh blimey, we've sprung a leak! Is this anybody's seat? No. Do you mind if I? How long before we take off, Bill? I don't know, ask Richard the Lion Heart. At least 10 minutes. 10 minutes? I could sing five songs. The passengers are nervous enough already. Oh, we've time for a bit of rehearsing. Why not? Don't often get an audience that can't walk out on us. Okay, let's go.

Best not make a fuss. Don't worry, there's no need to be nervous, is there? (engines running) We're airborne. Are we? Are we? Can't see nothing except wings and propellers. But are they turning? Only the propellers. Oh. It mentions me and the boys here, shall I read it to you? I'll just find the page. Billy Universe and the Satellites, who won the Pawley New Town Twist Contest last week, will represent the south of England in the Brussels Amateur Group Contest. The group leave for a one-night stint tomorrow, Thursday. We certainly are a great group. Great. [Billy] We made that song sound marvellous. Divine. [Billy] Do you know, one of the local papers even said that I was extremely handsome. More than handsome, everything. Do you really mean that? I'm sorry, what were you saying? Did you mean it, what you said? I'm afraid I was daydreaming. What did I say? Nothing, you didn't say nothing important. Sweets? What's he up to, then? Coming back. Fog on the continent, I suppose. Yeah, serves him right. [Captain] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Captain King speaking. I'm sorry to inform you we cannot take off owing to the rapid deterioration of weather conditions at Brussels. There you are, you see. That's what comes of tempting fate. I knew they'd never get it off the ground. There's nothing to worry about, sir. There'll just be a short delay. You always pretend it's nothing serious. It's probably a fuel leak. Brace yourself for an explosion. You can leave your luggage if you like. There may only be about an hour's delay. An hour? We're due onstage at 10:30. Well, don't worry, you should be in Brussels well before then. Just relax, follow me. Oh, what a lousy hand. [Ring-a-Ding] I'll raise you. Okay. I'll see you. I told you not to bluff that hand, you had nothing. It's only matchsticks. It's all money. Here, now I think you're stuck on that girl, Bill. You can't keep your peepers off her. Oh, shut up and deal. Hello, is Mister Grainger there? He's not. Do you know where I can contact him? Do you know when he'll be back then? No, it doesn't matter, I'll try later, if I can. Just tell him that Ann called. I don't want to play no more. But I've got a good hand. Well, here then. What else have we got to do? I might sing, that should cheer us up. It should? Well, it's better than playing cards for matchsticks. I don't know, I won four boxes.

Yeah, and I've got to be back at work at nine in the morning. Me, too. It's just not our day. Well, what are we gonna do, Billy? Nothing we can do. I'll see if I can get the money back. Yeah, and it's Pawley New Town, back we come. Excuse me, Miss. How do we get our money back? You see, there's no point in our going now. I am sorry. Give me your tickets and I'll see what I can do. Oh, you were so right not to leave the airport. The plane might leave without us, you know. Oh, there's the air hostess, perhaps she can give me a clue. Perhaps she's got our money, I'm starving. Yeah, I'm more bored than hungry. I wonder why Ann didn't go back to London with the others, Billy? How should I know? You'd have thought she'd have run back to the arms of her boyfriend now that her old man ain't here. Well, why doesn't she, then? Look, if you're so interested, why don't you go over and ask her? Yeah, you are sweet on that doll, Bill. Aw shut up. Here's the refund of your fares, sir. 85 pounds, seven and six. At least we did get something for winning that competition, anyway. Who wants to be a millionaire? What, in Pawley New Town? Come off it. If you follow me, sir, I'll take you through the customs. Well, what are we gonna do, Billy, go home? What do you suggest, a gay night out? Why not? Let's go uptown and do something daring. That's it, let's go up to London and blow this lot. Yeah, we were gonna spend it anyway. Hey, wait a minute. Look, why be miserable? Come up to town with us. We're gonna have a ball. If you don't mind, but thanks for asking. Isn't there anything in London that you want to see? Only one man, and I don't know where he is. That's why I'd just as soon stay here. Well, you won't see him here. I suppose I won't. We might be able to find Larry Grainger for you. If that's the guy you've got in mind. How? Well, he does all the night spots, doesn't he? He likes to be seen around. I read that in the New Musical Express. Yes, but which club would he be in tonight? Only one way to find out, look in them all. Come on, give it a try. Why not? Going? You mustn't go, I'm going to the window to look for the plane.

I read about it, it's sort of beatnicky, but it swings. Larry has been here before, I know, I've been with him. Shall we? (girl laughing) Horace, I think you must give them your poem tonight. Oh, but I've left it upstairs. All top stars dig this place. Real smooth, it is. Six please? Six what? Us, we're six. Congratulations. Look, if we're not welcome, we'll take our patronage elsewhere. Of course you're welcome. Anyone's welcome here. Seven and six to you. We'll dump the stuff over here. Here, wait a minute. That one looks a bit young, doesn't he? Him? He's a 32-year-old midget. - Oh. - Come on. I don't know how we're going to see Larry Grainger through all this, even if he is here. What we need is a plan of action. Yeah. Give me your evening paper. Can you read now? I just want to look at the pictures. I thought I recognised her, she's that heiress girl. You four men go that way, the rest stay with me. That only leaves her. So, you got a better suggestion? Melt. Yes, I thought your paper would be interested, Mister Brook. That's right, she's looking for Larry Grainger. What will you do, send a photographer over? Er, Mister Brook, you will look after me, won't you? [Man] He was using fly paper. [Woman] But flies can't read. Sorry, wrong man. [Woman] Do you think the twist has an inner meaning? I'm looking for someone. (upbeat jazz music) Here look, here's Larry Grainger. I found him. Oh you nit, you're raving mad. Any luck? No, not a clue. What are we gonna do now? Oh do let's eat man, I'm starving. Food, for thought. That's Horace. Please, please, please, be quiet. I bid your attention for a few moments. I am now going to read my poem. The jazz was digging for deep and dirty. Among the hipsters, cats and chicks. The beatniks (muffled). Oh, isn't he marvellous. Horace? As he always is.

Yeah, any idea where else Larry goes? Sure, if he's not here, he's usually at the Twist. Is that so? Where is the Twist? Round the corner, Old Compton Street. Thanks very much. It's nothing. Cheers. (upbeat swing music) They ain't playing the Twist. We haven't come here to dance. We've come here to look for Larry Grainger. After a bit of dancing, of course. Come on, fellows. Hey, Freddy, look after the luggage, will you? Yes, all right. Okay fellows, look around. Shall we look around the other side of the floor? I think it would be easier if we were dancing. Why not? Brook sent me, where's the girl? Well come on, where is she? Gone, I've just sent them around to the Twist. She won't find Larry Grainger there. I know, but I get commission on all the customers I introduce. (crowd murmuring) I couldn't see Grainger anywhere. Me neither. He's not here, Bill. That's for sure. Shall we move on? Seems a shame to go without doing the Twist. The twist, I say isn't that the thing you said you did rather well? The twist, I mean. I say, band leader fellow. Can't you play the twist, then? - We can. - [Shane] Sure. I say, Robin, they're rather small. Well after all, they are the lower classes. Come on fellows, let's twist.

My feet are killing me. Second right, first left, you can't miss it. Why can't we take a taxi, too? Because Billy's got all our money. Who was that girl in the teeni-taxi? Search me, governor. Someone looking for a guy called Larry, I believe. Thanks. Can you catch that teeni-taxi? I'll run it down, if you like. We go left here. Right. No, second left, first right, eh? Oh no, Freddy. First left, second right. Anyway, he said we couldn't miss it. So where is it? We must have missed it. Ah, it's this way. I hope. (group talking) (swing music) Sit over there, I'll get you a drink.

Now, keep calm, both of you. Let's, let's make a deal, eh? May I? You're looking for Larry Grainger, aren't you? So what? Oh, I know where to find him. Where? That's part of the deal. You let me take a picture of you now, and I'll tell you. And then you'll stop following me? Scout's honour. Go ahead. Sit down next to her, Sir Galahad. No thanks, she's in enough trouble already.

Well, you've got to get ready for your dancing act and I've got things to do. Things to do? Look, you can't treat me like this. Look darling, this is business. You go backstage, I'll come by for you later. But Larry, you promised. Will you do as I say? You will come back later, won't you? I said I would, didn't I? Close your eyes and count three. Oh, Larry darling. I thought I'd never see you again. Touching, ain't it? Well what do we do? Play hearts and flowers? Finish our supper, I suppose. It's going to cost enough. Who's this lot? Some boys I met at the airport. They've been terribly kind to me. They found you for me. Can't we get rid of them? I have a lot to talk to you about. Come to my table. All right. I'll never be able to thank you enough, Billy. That's all right. Yeah, thanks a lot. I'll do the same for you some day. Oh, leave your names and addresses, I'll send you some records. Thanks. Billy's a pop singer too, you know. You don't say. That's right, the best in Pawley New Town. You must hear him soon, he's very good. Perhaps you could help him. Yeah sure, I'll give you an audition some time. Now, if you'll excuse us, boys. Wouldn't you like to sit with us? You must be kidding. Grow up, fellows. Here, he's well pleased with himself, ain't he? So he's a big head. Why not? Well we'd be the same if we were in the top 20. He's no good, is he Billy? I don't reckon it's any of our business. Does your father know what's happened? No, he thinks I'm in Brussels. Good, he is going to get a nasty surprise. You've ordered. Yes, I had my manager with me. I needed someone's shoulder to cry on. As soon as I knew you were here, I sent him packing. I'm far too excited to eat. What are we going to do, Larry? I've only got three hours left. We're gonna get married. That's what we're gonna do. We can't, I promised Daddy. Is he more important to you than me? No, of course not, but I'm not old enough to marry without his permission. You are in Scotland. We can catch the midnight train. Oh Larry, do you really mean that? Of course I do, darling. Maxie! Bring us a bottle of champagne, will you? Do you want the wine list, sir? Bring us the best. We've got something to celebrate haven't we, darling? What's the matter with him, then? Why don't you grow up like the man said. It must be a terrible thing when a girl puts you off your grub. Hey, I've got an idea. Yeah? You know Larry Grainger said he might be able to help us if he heard us. So? Well, he is here and we're here. But they've already got a band. Yeah, but they might be able to fix it for Billy. Have you gone off your nut? Well, it's an idea, isn't it? Yeah, a crazy one. But I dig it. What can I get you? I'll have a scotch. But you don't drink. Now is as good a time as any, to start. How about you? I'll have a coke. That's the girl he was making love to. She must be one of the dancers. She looks as miserable as you do. If you ask me Ann's father's right, that Grainger's a bum. Nobody asked you. Do you reckon we ought to do something about her? No, we're not going to do anything about anything. It's none of our business. Here, what about the money? Excuse me, sir. Did you say something? [Barmaid] No, sir. Sir, excuse me. Why, a little man. Now, what can I do for you, son? Well sir, you see Billy Universe is here. He is, where? He's in the restaurant. Well, I hope he's enjoying the food, all prepared by our genuine Chinese chef. By the way, how is our Chinese chef? We haven't got one. We haven't? Well who's been making the grub? That German bird, the one you got from the Indian restaurant. A German cook? Perhaps we should change this place into a German restaurant. I'm getting tired of rice, anyway. Billy Universe, sir. Well, what about him? I was wondering if you'd let him sing, just one number? Certainly, certainly, my boy. Of course, I'll have to let the kids dance at the same time, just in case your friend ain't so hot. They'll have something to do, but if he's any good he can come back again and sing for money. Not too much money, of course, but money. Where you been? I fixed it, Billy, you're gonna sing. What are you talking about? I got a chance, here, tonight. Fabulous, we'll be made. (crosstalk) I want to speak to Sir Charles Bryant, please. My name's Russell Skinner of the London Night Column. Oh, yes yes, of course Sir Charles knows me. Tell him it's about his daughter. No no no no no, that's the point, she's not in Brussels. Thank you. Sir Charles, have you got anything to say about your daughter? She's at the Lotus Club at the moment with a Mister Larry Grainger. Wait, what what, you'll be over right away? Oh, yes yes, I'll be here. And now ladies and gentlemen, let's move all the tables back for a twist session. And at the same time give a big hand to a young man who's gonna give us a song, Mister Billy Universe. (audience cheering and applauding) [Man] Well done! Good old Bill. Show 'em then, come on. Now what's the name of this song, son? And what key do you sing in? "Twist Kid", and... what key do I sing in? C major.

Can you beat that? They must have walked out on us. Where's Larry Grainger? What's it to you? You promised to leave Miss Bryant alone. Now look fellows, you like Miss Bryant, don't you? She's all right. What about Larry Grainger, do you like him? He stinks. And you'd like to see that lovely young girl married to a skunk like him? Well, she's not gonna marry him, is she? If he's got anything to do with it, she is. Look, she's got money, class, she's in high society. She's in the upper bracket. And that's what our frog-throated friend wants to be. So where are they? We don't know, they've just disappeared. And you're going to sit there and do nothing about it? Yeah, that's right. It just isn't our day. You kids are all the same these days. Well, if you see either of them let me know, I'll be around. Whatever we do is wrong. Let's get the bill and go. Where to? Home, nit, where else? Ta. Seven and six. Seven pounds, six shillings. You're joking! He's not joking, you know. I'm off. Excuse me, waitress, is this correct? Excellent done, my boy, you were most melodious. And as a small token of my appreciation let me tear up this bill. Thank you very much. You must come back again. Get in touch. You must sing here again, and your friends must play here, too. Yes, sure. Of course, I don't know why you're going. We're open for hours yet. Cab, sir? No thanks, we'll walk. Hey, did Larry Grainger and that young lady get a cab? Yes sir, friend of yours? Sort of. I suppose they've gone off to another night club or something, eh? Not tonight, sir. They were hoping to catch the 12:10 to Glasgow. Glasgow! Where does that go from? Euston. Yes, sir. Hey fellows, he's taking her to Euston. Well, what does he want to do that for? To get her to Scotland. To get married. That's it, Gretna Green. The stinker. We're gonna stop him, aren't we Billy? What do you think? To Euston. Here, wait a minute, I'm not taking all that clobber as well. [Joey] We can't leave it behind, mate. There's no time to argue, leave it with him and we'll pick it up later. (tense music) Hey, what's he stopped for? The traffic lights. Don't mind the lights mate, we're in a hurry. Here, here, who's gonna pay the fine? We are, get going. Right. (dramatic orchestral music) Only three minutes left to go. Are you sure that watch is all right? Yeah, but I think my arm is broken. (tense orchestral music) You've got to stop the train. But how? I don't know, but don't let it start. Quick, quick, stop the train! Stop the train, quick! The wheel, the wheel? It's cracked on the other side. What, what are you talking about? There it is, down there, it's cracked. The bloke that goes gedoyng with the doings, he must have missed it. It's as wide as this. Are you having me on? Of course, I'm not. Just trying to prevent a horrible accident, with hundreds of people killed, and bodies piled up all over the place. Come on, this way, quick! That boy says a wheel's cracked. No. It is, it'll be your responsibility if something horrible happens. We'd better go and have a look, then. The Governor's not gonna like this. (tense orchestral music) Here is is, Guv. Cor, it's worse than I thought. I can't see nothing there. That's oil, isn't it? Here, let's have a look. What is it now then? It's Ann's father, he's on the train with two detectives. What? That's why it's being held up. They're looking for you. But, I haven't broken the law or anything. He's charging you with kidnapping a minor. - What shall I do, then? - No, don't run away. They'll catch you for sure. I know what, get in there. Hurry up, there's no time to lose. Now stay in there for half an hour. You'll be all right, you'll be able to sit down. What about Ann? I'll tell her to do the same thing at the other end. There's no crack here. Looks like somebody's been having you on. Where's that boy? Oh! Ann, you've got to get off. It's what Larry wants, he sent me. But I can't. Hurry up, I'll explain later, come on, come on. We can't hold the train up any longer. Report that boy to the police. (whistling) Where's Larry? He, he went back to the Lotus, didn't he, Joey? Yeah yeah, he told us to meet him there, didn't he, Freddy? Oh sure yeah, it's what he said. Wasn't it, Alvin? Yeah, yeah. So we'd better go back there, eh Billy? - Yeah, yeah man. - And the quicker the better, otherwise somebody might want to have a little talk with me. That's all right, Ring-a-ding, get in the middle. Come on, fellows. (mischievous music) The Lotus Room presents, Bobby Vee.

What are we gonna do now? Somebody'll have to tell her. Yeah, and that'll have to be Billy. I wonder if our instruments are all right? Where is he, can you see him? No. There's that photographer again. He could make trouble, let's go down here. What about Larry? We'll worry about him later. Look! That's my father, he mustn't see me. Where can I hide? Come on, down this way. That journalist fellow, Skinner, is he here? Yes, he's downstairs, sir. If you follow me, I'll take you to his table. Oh, thank you very much. (swing music) Now my father is coming down, he's bound to see me. Let's go this way. Now where are we? We're on a staircase and if we don't get down fast, your father is gonna catch us. Hey, what are you two doing here? I'm, I'm looking for a friend. We're not friendly see, now beat it. But we can't go back up there, not for a while, anyway. Listen chums, it isn't me, it's the dance director. He can't stand people backstage with his blooming dancers. Yeah, but the dancers are still on stage. Come on, do us a favour. Okay then, but keep out of their way when they come off, won't you? Or they won't 'arf get a rocket. All right, thanks. Let's go this way. If anyone comes, we'll duck behind that scenery. Where's Larry, Billy? I must find him. Well, I've got to tell you sooner or later, Larry's not here. He's still on the train. But why? What is all this? Well, your father was right about Larry. Ann, he's no good, honest. How dare you interfere. What's it got to do with you? Wait! Don't you understand, he's a louse. He's not even in your league. When you were supposed to be on your way to Brussels, he was making love to somebody else. You're lying. Why should I lie? You don't mean anything to me. I, I didn't mean that, I like you, I like you very much. You've ruined everything. Oh, let me go, I'm going to find Larry. You can't go up there, miss, they'll be streaming down, you'd better get out of sight. Quick, behind there. Oh, I could kill you for this. You've got to find somebody new. Oh, excuse me, sir. I beg your pardon, I'm looking for, mm, I'm looking for, yes. I'm looking for mm, yes, that'll do. I'm looking for, looking for, mm mm, Helen Shapiro. Oh yes, that way. Thank you very much. Thank you. You, I've got you running around. But I don't care. Ted, quick, listen. I've got a great number for Helen. This is marvellous, Ted, it's got everything. It's got heart, it's got soul, it's even got a tune. Listen, every top singer in the country will want my number. But I'm gonna let Helen have first opportunity. Say no more, Ted, I can tell you're interested. I shall play it for you on the piano. Don't go away. Now listen everybody, I must have quiet. You understand, absolute and utter quiet. Now look boys, join me in the second chorus, I'm only playing one.

Another hit. I'm a genius, I've always said I was a genius. Bye, bye. Bye bye. Another hit, I've done it again! Trying to pinch my songs, eh? Who would have thought an idiot like that could have written a song like this? Well, what are you gonna do now? I'm going to Scotland. Even if I have to go by milk train. I suppose it's your fault that my daughter's vanished? Taking her around the town, indeed, when she should be going to Brussels. Look, the plane was... I know all about the plane. She should have phoned me. into the arms of that Grainger. If I may say, Sir Charles. Oh, you've said enough. You told me that they were looking for Grainger. Yes sir, but we don't really... Never mind, the point is, where is Ann now? I really couldn't say where she is right now, sir. But I'm sure she'll be at the airport to catch the plane. The plane is leaving at six o'clock in the morning, now. She'll probably be miles away with that Grainger fellow, thanks to you interfering delinquents. What do you suggest we do, Sir Charles? May as well go to the airport, wait, and hope. What else can I do? Have you told her about Larry Grainger? Yeah, but she doesn't believe me. Will you please get me a taxi? The plane's not till six now. I'm not getting the plane. Freddy, get Ann a taxi. Sure. Let's have a drink before you go, huh? It would be best if we part friends. All right, just one drink. I know you've been trying to help, but Larry's not what you think. I know him so well. There are always all sorts of terrible rumours about famous people. Sorry, the bar's closed. Oh, it's you. Well, you can have a soft drink in there if you want to be alone. Just a few of the cabaret girls in one corner, they won't disturb you. Thanks very much. (soft orchestral music) Isn't she that girl who was here with Larry Grainger? That's right. Five cokes, please. The taxi's waiting. Freddy's got the taxi. Well, I won't wait for the drinks, if you don't mind. Goodbye. Goodbye. This is Yvonne Pemberton. You two have got a lot in common. It seems that Larry Grainger has been making up to both of you this evening. That's right, Ann. This is the girl I was telling you about. She was with Larry when we arrived here. That doesn't prove anything. Look, honey, I'm just one of a hundred girls who's been pushed around by that, that puffed up pop singer. And although I'm in love with him, I'm bright enough to see that he doesn't love anybody but himself, leave alone you. That's not true. Oh, yes it is. He only wants you because he's a crashing snob and he thinks that he marries a lady, he'll become a gentleman. Gentleman. If he had one spark of decency he'd have married me. Well, that's my good turn for the night. She'd better have that drink after all, Bill. And after you've had it, we can dance a bit. Then we'll take you back to the airport. You've still got heaps of time before you catch that plane to Brussels. Give her your handkerchief, Billy. ♪ I want you to be mine, whoa ♪ ♪ I think you're swell ♪ ♪ You're cold as ice ♪ ♪ But oh so very nice, whoa ♪ Yes, that's them all right, Sir Charles. And Ann appears to be with them. Thank God for that. Here we are, another safe journey. And this time we've got a reception committee. Yes. Oh, Daddy! Are you all right, darling? It's all finished, and I want to go to Brussels. Would you like me to come too? But first you must thank these boys, they were so kind to me, and they showed me the side of Larry that you've always tried to make me see. These boys, I must do more than thank them. I must apologise to you all for misinterpreting what's been going on. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you. That's all right. Yeah well, I don't suppose we'll be seeing you again, Ann. So, we'd better say goodbye. Of course we'll see you again. Daddy, when we get back from Brussels, we must give a big dance at Claridge's, and Billy and the boys must play, but they're quite expensive. Whatever the price, it will be a pleasure. I'll go and fix my ticket. Goodbye, boys. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Billy. Fellows. I'll never forget tonight. Wave me off from the terrace. You heard the lady. Let's nip up to the old roof. What about breakfast? We'll have that later, come on. (aircraft taking off) Here, this is better than the roof. And there's the plane. Yeah. I say, aren't you coming on the plane with us? No, we're not going now. You scared us off. I did? Well, really some people have all the luck. Think of me, won't you? All right, I'm coming, wait for me. Bye! Well, I guess that's that.
