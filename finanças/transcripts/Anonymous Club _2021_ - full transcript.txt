(UPBEAT MUSIC) (ZIPPER ZIPS) -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(PEOPLE SHOOSH) (FILM REEL ROLLS) (RATTLING) (SERENE MUSIC) (SLOW GUITAR MUSIC) Singing about panic attacks is not something most singers like to get into. That's kind of touchy territory. How is it for you, having your work associated with such difficult, unpleasant, painful things? Does that bother you? Is that a badge of pride for you? Like, how do you reflect on that? Um, I think all of my songs are just trying to figure feelings and situations out, um, you know, very...very openly and to whoever's willing to listen. DJ: Talk about where you're at right now artistically, emotionally in the songs. How... (LAUGHS) How do you really feel these days? COURTNEY: I just turned 30 last year and I feel like I stepped over some sort of line but, I don't know, it's still...I'm still lost. -(LAUGHS) -Still kind of figuring it out? Every day, trying to figure... figure stuff out. But I feel, uh, you know, pretty grateful and just doing it.

ANNOUNCEMENT IN MANDARIN) COURTNEY: I had a submission on my website with a comment box asking people to tell me how you really feel. It's been really humbling and really beautiful reading what people are willing to share and to, uh...to be open about. I'm gonna read you some. There's, like, literally thousands of them. (READS) "Feeling lonely but I don't know why." "Feeling exhausted but don't wanna show it." "A little guilty but generous." "Giddy with falling in love." "Happy but stressed." "Brave and terrified." There's a really overwhelming number of, "I feel tired". "I feel hopeless." "I feel alone." A lot of people feel alone. Maybe they're not so alone.

One day it can be so totally liberating and electric and energetic and alive. And then another day, it can just be so rigid and full of fear and...and, uh, can feel so far away. Going through those motions and playing the songs and then, um, just having this whole other narrative running in my head about how everyone, you know, is standing still and thinks I'm a big joke and talentless. (LOW, ENIGMATIC MUSIC) 'Cause I see myself trying to go through, you know, these motions of, you know, what... what you're supposed to do or what people expect you to do. It's like that unwritten rule on stage to, uh, you know, walk to the front and put your guitar in the air and then that corner of the crowd screams. It feels like I'm being part of this scripted performance of what we...you know, of...of...of... ..of what we think we're supposed to see on stage and it just feels really pointless. I think forward to next year, we have this whole year mapped out and I don't know what the point of it is. I do wanna do this tour but I also just don't wanna do it at the same time. And, um... I don't really know why. (SINGS) ♪ Don't go changing on me... ♪ (STRUMS) (PLAYS SINGLE NOTE) G. (TUNES GUITAR) (CLEARS THROAT) Oh! Indecent.

And you also say, "You must be lonely being angry." Obviously, like, both men and women feel fear and anger, but men are kind of conditioned to channel it into violence and women are often at the receiving end of that violence. So I wanted to talk to you about how you kind of think about male fear and how it's transformed into violence. Yeah, I think the song... I mean, I don't...I don't know. I think that that's the point of the song, is just that kind of... ..study of it, in a way, and kind of trying to understand it as a means to kind of, um... you know, combat it or...or...or that kind of idea to, yeah... To be able to dismantle something, you need to be able to understand it in a way, or, um... (DICTAPHONE CLICKS) Someone left a note saying, "You are great at music "but, please God, stop doing interviews. "It's horrendous." And I got really bummed out. It made me really sad 'cause, I mean, I don't know how to say these things that I want to say and I know I end up sounding like a fuckin' moron. To be completely honest, I just feel like I've kind of let myself down somehow with the release of this album. You know, what could have been a fantastic conversation around fragility and...and depression and mental health, it just ended up kind of being swept to the side because I was too scared to talk about anything real or heavy. I get frustrated myself. It's like, "Why can't you just be, "like, a strong, powerful communicator?" Courtney Barnett und band. (CHEERING) Very good to have you. (SPEAKS GERMAN) It's not only a feel-good writer, you're always also angry. You're saying, "I'm not your bitch, I'm not your mother." (SPEAKS GERMAN) Who is bothering you? (SPEAKS GERMAN) (LAUGHS) Um, that's a big first question. I, uh... (LAUGHS) I don't think I was ready for that. We don't have so much time, so... Yeah, I don't think there's enough time in the world to answer that question. So you don't know who you're talking about? Oh, yeah, but I don't wanna, you know, make it too obvious.

I woke up having one of those, like, just-feeling-sad days. Which is OK. I think sometimes it's just OK to feel sad and keep on going with what you're doing and...being sad. I guess I'm aware that, you know, people think that touring makes me sad, but I think, in reality, I remember having feelings like this when I was, like, 10 years old and just... (CHUCKLES) ..being, like, emo - an emo kid - before I knew what emo was. Anyway, today I feel sad.

(SIGHS) I don't think I've ever cried on stage like that. It actually felt quite nice. (CHUCKLES) Felt quite liberating, crying in front of 2,000 people. And people were just like, "What the fuck?

I don't know why I write or I don't know why I put all this energy, you know, into...into this thing that I do, that we do that, like... ..sometimes it's hard to comprehend if it's a waste of energy. I don't know what my true intention is. I don't know if I'm trying to impress someone... ..or if I'm trying to get vengeance for someone who picked on me once in my life or trying to make someone proud or trying to prove someone wrong or...or if I'm just trying to make someone feel something or if I'm just trying to... ..make myself feel something.

I seem to start the day off with so much optimism. And then by now, it's, uh... ..it's all kinda gone downhill a little bit. But, you know, I, uh... I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about anymore. I don't know... I don't understand the point of talking about my feelings. I've got nothing to complain about, so what am I doing talking about it? I realistically should have power to, um...be useful and to be helpful, and all I can do is whinge. Yeah, I don't think I'm really in the mood to indulge my, uh, egotistical, uh, side. I just don't see the point in doing this. And I don't think I'm at a place where I can help anyone 'cause I can't even seem to really help myself or be useful, uh, to myself. I just feel like I'm going around in circles and digging myself a deeper hole. -Courtney Barnett. -(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: 'Tell Me How You Really Feel' is the second full-length solo album from the Sydney-born, Hobart-raised, Melbourne-based singer-songwriter, which she released on her own label, Milk! Records. Courtney's debut album scored four ARIAs as well as nominations at the Brit Awards and the Grammys. Congratulations, Courtney Barnett. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) Congratulations. Congratulations. Well, uh, thank you very much. Oh, it IS nerve-racking up here. Now I understand. -Um... -(WOMAN WHOOPS AND LAUGHS) I would, uh... I'd love to, you know, introduce my band. I couldn't, uh...I couldn't do all the shows and make records without my amazing band. Bones Sloane, Dave Mudie, Katie Harkin. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) COURTNEY: I watched, um, the Nico film - like, Nico the singer. There was this great line, she said something along the lines of... "When I had nothing, I wasn't happy. "And when I had everything, I wasn't happy." I guess, um, I've got no idea what nothing even feels like. (CHUCKLES) 'Cause I've got...something. I've always had something. (CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, I was thinking today, I always talk to you about the same shit. And, um...I've been such a fuckin' bore. Such a bore. Just listening to myself is... ..frustrating. Should get something real to write about... ..instead of just talking about writing. It's all I ever do. I talk about how hard it is. (YAWNS) How much I struggle but I don't actually do any writing, or any good writing. I just write rubbish... ..about nothing. 'Cause I've got nothing to talk about. 'Cause my head is just empty. My heart is empty, my head is empty. The page is empty.

COURTNEY: Um... Well, when I got back from tour, I stayed...I stayed at the warehouse and then at that house in Thornbury. Was there maybe somewhere else? Sublet. Just little sublets and house-sitting situations. Which are good and fine, but just, like...just feel like my stuff is always scattered everywhere. So it feels a little bit stressful. And then I end up... Like, I went back to the warehouse the other day and I just felt like I'd rather just be there, be in a weird space where all of my things are. I'm so excited to get my haircut today. Oh, God. DANNY: And what's the plan with it? -Just, like, the... -DANNY: A reset? The... Yeah, the...the re-zhoosh. DANNY: "Give me the Courtney," you'd say. (LAUGHS) Yeah. Gonna have to find some photos of myself to show her and say, "Do it just like this." I feel like, you know, sometimes the longer you leave something, the harder it is to reset. Like, it's like it takes longer to get back to normal. (DICTAPHONE CLICKS) I just remembered about this, um, post that Patti Smith put up the other week. Um, it really resonated with me. It came through making a lot of sense. "Despite all the strife in the world, "we must continue to do our work. "Creating takes up much of the artist's time "and may seem a self-serving prospect. "But the directive is to offer something meaningful "that hopefully provides a transformative experience, "whether through tears, laughter or illumination. "So I am back to work, grateful I have work "and that there are those who wait and support it." Anyway, I like going back to that when I feel lost lately. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) COURTNEY: Sometimes by the end of the day, it feels like the world is, uh, crashing down around me. I know it's not completely bad because I'm looking forward to the next day. You know, I have hope for the next day. You know, I want the chance to create the, uh... ..the memory of the next day, to fix whatever was wrong the day before. So I know I'm not in too much trouble... ..when I feel low. Uh... It's 5am. I don't know why... why I'm awake. I just had one of those... ..revelation moments. (INAUDIBLE) I just have this real, uh, feeling that I need to change something. I need to make a big change, or lots of big changes. This might sound cryptic. I guess it kind of is, but I don't really know either. I just... It's just a feeling. It's strong and it's, uh, overwhelming right now. And, uh, I think when a feeling like that comes, you need to, um... you need to just trust it, and trust your instinct, trust your gut. (MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Oh, yeah. Which one do you like, Danny? (STRUMS NOTES) You know, I go through so much love and hate of performing and, like, falling into the groove of the same thing, which can sometimes be so great. But, um, I kind of thirst for, um, difference and change and, like, pushing my own comfort levels. Maybe I'll organise a little solo run of some small places. I think it'll be really good for me to, um... ..to...to hear the songs differently. You know, I'll have to re-imagine them. And I think in that process, I'll understand them differently. I feel like that will be a really good thing for me. That's my shoe collection. (LAUGHS) (VOCALISES IN WARBLING MANNER) It's gonna be a very attentive audience. I'm scared. Very quiet. (HUMS) I just have to be like, "They're not quiet because they hate me. "They're quiet because it's a quiet room "and they are, uh, listening politely." And... We are, uh... We get scared to make noise in those moments. (CHUCKLES) I do. As an audience member, I would be like, "Gotta be quiet." So I just have to be cool. Be calm and collected. DANNY: I mean, everyone's bought a ticket, right? Yeah. Unless they got a free ticket. (BOTH LAUGH) DANNY: That's what's going through your head? "All these people got a free ticket. I hope they're..." Maybe ticket sales were bad, so the local radio station was giving away tickets, you know what I mean? DANNY: That's going through your head on stage? Yeah. Maybe someone got given a ticket for Christmas and they were like, "I don't wanna go to that shit." And they gifted it, they regifted it. DANNY: Mmm. -You know? -DANNY: Yeah. Maybe they...they hate-bought a ticket. They were like, "I hate her. I'm gonna hate-watch... "I'm gonna hate-watch this show "and just hate every minute of it." These are real things that people do. DANNY: Instead of just going and enjoying themselves? Yeah. (LAUGHS) WOMAN: OK. Do you wanna go on on the right or the left? -Right, please. -This way. Follow me. (COURTNEY CHUCKLES) Can you see?

There's fires in Australia. It's, like, 40 degrees. Our 40 degrees. Celsius. I don't know what that is. Like a hundred? There's fires one day, and then the next day there was floods, and then the next day, there was, like, hail. And then the next day there was a...dust storm that lifted dust from the centre of Australia all the way to the east coast. And the air was just red. And then the rain was red. And the puddles were red. You know, let's keep talking about it. I think it's good to talk about it. Like, all those bad things. Otherwise... They're not just gonna go away if we don't talk about it, right? -Right? -(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) If we just pretend it's not happening. Be careful on the icy roads.

DANNY: Well, sit...sit wherever you're comfortable. That's it. Right there. (COURTNEY LAUGHS) DANNY: Facing the wall. Yeah, perfect. (LAUGHS) DANNY: There we go. Yeah. I was nervous before it started, but I think the whole... ..this whole tour has been really...has been really good. I think I was a little bit, like, unsure of how I could be entertaining enough, but...but the audiences have been so, um, like, straightaway, um, positive and really warm and... And... Yeah. It's... There's something about it I've just really loved. Like, the...it's like a different kind of intimacy with them and, like, a kind of conversation almost, which feels really good. And it's, like, revitalised something. Like, some sort of confidence or some sort of...belief. And it's good, I mean, it makes me want to write better songs, because the songs are so bare. So it's, like, you really...you know, you really hear everything in the song, so it's good in that way. It makes me want to kind of try different things and think...think differently. So, like, different songwriting.

Like, this doesn't feel like it's flowing properly. There's something wrong with it. It's, like, when it's really fun to play over and over, then you know it's finished. It's never completely finished, but that's when it's mostly finished. Close to finished. (CONTINUES PLAYING) DANNY: How long have you been working on it? I guess it's kind of fresh. It's...

Like, I'm feeling very comfortable on stage, which is rare. But I think it's, like, the no set-up time. It's like, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you're on stage. Which I think is probably good for me, so I don't think about it too much. (STRUMS RANDOM NOTES) Encore? Should I do an encore? Do people like encores? The age-old debate.

DANNY: Yeah. I got them in Mexico. -DANNY: Mexico? -Yep. (DICTAPHONE CLICKS) Danny, you're gonna be so upset with me. I haven't...I haven't talked to the dictaphone this whole tour. I feel like everything is starting to make more sense. I think the...the journey is understanding what the... what the purpose is. And, uh, I think everyone struggles with that journey. It's probably a lifelong kind of exploration. Sorry, this is gonna be a disappointing, uh, moment when I hand it over to you, but, uh...in the process of not talking, I feel like I've, uh... I've discovered something, which could, um, help, uh, in the... in the bigger picture. So let's see. Let's see how that goes. This year, I'm just learning how to slow down. And, um, learning the kind of importance of solitude and reflection. My new home. I do this thing where I think I'm not being heard. I just have this fear that the... ..you know, the microphone isn't loud enough or that I'm not being clear enough. So that's why I kind of end up singing louder and screaming and playing guitar louder and everything kind of slowly starts edging upwards. But I just feel like making quiet and peaceful, calm music. You know, as if you're in the room with me, just kind of quietly singing you this idea. Like a gentleness that I think I lost along the way. I just can't yell anymore. For now. (LAUGHS) You need anything? DANNY: You talking to me or the cat? COURTNEY: You. (LAUGHS) DANNY: No, thank you. (CAT PURRS) Hello. (CHUCKLES) You wanna be in the movie? Yes, you do.

Foot traffic. Yeah. Well, what I've learnt is that nobody looks up. People look at the ground or they look at their phone or they look ahead, obviously. But they don't look up. I love the colour of the trees at the moment. Well, it's getting more into winter, so it's kind of fading, but... ..all those red and orange leaves everywhere. So beautiful. I was playing with the inks the other day. I quite like that one. That's the window. Does that look like me? That was a self-portrait. It kind of... it kind of looks like how I drew in high school. DANNY: I can't tell which one's the real Courtney. I'm looking very pouty. (LAUGHS) And then I started drawing lots of birds on the wires. -(BACKGROUND POP MUSIC PLAYS) -(HUMS ALONG) -(DICTAPHONE CLICKS) -Mmm, Danny. Um, I'm thinking about, um, how to make my next record. I kind of have no idea where to start. I think I might ask my friend Stella to help me, um... gather my thoughts and my ideas into one spot. ♪ Let me know, let me know how you go, how you go... ♪ (CONTINUES HUMMING ALONG TO BACKGROUND POP MUSIC) ♪ How, how it shows... ♪ (GUITAR, RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT AND CLICKS PLAY) I feel so happy today. It's hard to explain why but I just, um... I feel really, uh, inspired. I just really miss making music, I think. I miss making music with other people. DANNY: What's the song about? What's this song about? (RHYTHMIC ELECTRONIC BEAT PLAYS) It's about, um... ..um, a conversation with a friend who is telling...me, um, about someone they're in love with.

I like it. I think it gives it a little bit of...interest. (DICTAPHONE CLICKS) I think the thing that always gets me is that it...like, when you record something, you're making this definitive piece of history that will sit as a thing forever. That makes sense. But I think also... I really love the idea of, um...of letting go of that perfectionism. Like, letting go of the idea that what I'm doing is the most important thing in the world. Not to, like, give it no credit, but, you know, it's true. There's...there's no point working up, I don't know, these big, like, walls of catastrophe... ..and disaster over...over creation. Gonna clock off for now, but I'll...I'll come back with something eventually. Alright, Danny. 'Bye. I just think it has room to be, um, more inconsistent. STELLA: Yep. Play.

Hold on. Wait. -Go. Go. Go. -Go! -One, two, three, go! Fuck. -Another one. -Cancel each other out. Another one. No, exactly the same time. Ready? On 'go' or 'three'? One, two, three and then go. -So technically four. -(LAUGHS) -One, two, three, four! -One, two, three, go! (DICTAPHONE CLICKS) Every now and then, I have this real moment of, uh...of clarity. Like, I have this understanding and this, uh, opposite of anxiety washes over me and I feel like I'm moving ahead somehow. When you can see ahead and see the positive, then when you do take two steps back and you're in the negative, then you know that... ..it's a possibility to...to feel good again. It's just a nice reminder that...that there's good things ahead, there's good things coming, and there's good things in the past, and you just have to take them and build on them and, um, rearrange them to get where you wanna get in the future. (INAUDIBLE) I think the last album, you can hear a lot of, um, like, tension in there, a lot of kind of defensiveness and frustration and anger, and I feel this album is a lot more kind of gentle and, um, open, and these songs focus on...love. But not just love of a person, but love of, like, being a loving person. (STELLA LAUGHS) Are you planning to see Georgia again when you go through Sydney? Yeah, when we go back through Sydney. So a few weeks away, we'll see Blake and Hayley and Georgia. -And, um... -Right, good. I'll give them an extra... an extra hug for you both. (CONTINUES CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) COURTNEY: As someone once told me, my albums won't be with me on my deathbed holding my hand. This film will not be with us as we lie dying. But I like to think in the bigger scheme of things, it will live on and... ..help other people or inspire other people or create some sort of conversation... ..for some purpose. (INAUDIBLE) I think I've figured out that my eternal goal is...to empower people who need empowering. To communicate ideas and stories and emotions. To give someone in the audience the energy or the power... (INAUDIBLE) ..to feel something. To forget something. To remember something. To be inspired. To feel happiness or to feel an emotion... ..that, um, allows them to transcend... ..life. And, um...you know, helps them in...in their journey.
