It's his old stamping ground. (SID CHUCKLES) (MEN CHUCKLING) GERALD: Must be a bloody contortionist. Oh, not suede boots. SID: Knock it off, Gerald. GERALD: What, and get the clap? (GERALD CHUCKLES) (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC STOPS) GERALD: We don't want you to go up the north, Jack. No? GERALD: You work for us, Jack. You know we're connected with the Newcastle mob. I'd hate you to screw it up. What's that, a python? (CHUCKLING) What you going for? To find out what happened. GERALD: Look, your brother's dead and gone. They're hard nuts up there, Jack. They won't take kindly to someone from London poking his nose in. Too bad. GERALD: Remember, they're killers just like you. SID: The police seem satisfied. Since when was that good enough? Think again, Jack. I will. (TRAIN HORN WAILS) (WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA) (CAR HORN HONKS) (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (CHATTERING) Pint of bitter. In a thin glass.

Will you be there tomorrow? Now listen, Mar... (DIAL TONE) (WATER DRIPPING) (SWITCH CLICKS) JACK: I won't be using the room tonight. EDNA: I see. JACK: I'm staying with a friend. (EDNA CHUCKLES) - Her husband docks tomorrow, does he? - It's not like that, love. It never is. - Are you a traveler? - Definitely. - Will this do? - Yes. Very nice. Very nice. - I'll pay you for tonight as well. - Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday. - You sure? - Ta. I bet this has seen some action, hasn't it? I'll give you the key when you come down. (SHAVER BUZZING) Was he in bad shape? They come worse. Doreen. All right, are you? Been staying with a friend? I'm sorry about your father. Tell me, Doreen... did the police say anything? They said he was drunk. - How's school? - I left last year. - Oh. What are you doing now? - Working at Woolworths. - That must be very interesting. - Yes. What are you gonna do? Live with Margaret? Well, why won't you come with us to South America? My fianc√©e wouldn't mind. And that's how your dad would have liked it. UNDERTAKER: Get Hubert up, will you? We're ready now, sir. We weren't sure where it was taking place, you know. - Nice of you to come. - Oh, Frank was a good bloke. - He was that. - EDDIE: One of the best. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) - I couldn't believe it when I heard. - What? I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time. - Did you work with him, Keith? - At the Half Moon. It's a bloody funny thing, you know. You work with a bloke for six bloody years... and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus. Then he goes and does a thing like that. Bloody funny thing. JACK: Yeah, a bloody funny thing. (CHURCH BELL TOLLING) VICAR: Will you all stand up, please? For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy... to take unto himself the soul of our dear brother here departed... we therefore commit his body to be consumed by fire... in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life... through our Lord, Jesus Christ. Who shall change the body of our low estate. - Is that Margaret? - Yes. VICAR: Who shall change the body of our low estate... that it may be like unto his glorious body... according to the mighty working... whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself. (MAN WHISTLING) (BELL TOLLING) JACK: Margaret? - I thought you weren't coming. - Changed my mind. - Everything go off all right, then? - Fine. I wanna talk to you. - What about? - Doreen. She's nothing to do with me. What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. - You're closer to her than anyone. - No, no, it's not like that. I've got a husband, you know. Hold it. Hold it. Who killed Frank, Margaret? Killed? I don't know anything about it. - Really? - I must go. I'm in a hurry. I wanna talk to you later. - I can't. - Tomorrow morning, then. Well, all right, then, 12:00 on the Iron Bridge. Dinner. Well, absent friends. You don't suppose he might have done it on purpose. - What? You mean like kill himself? - Hmm. No, Frank kill himself? Get away. - I mean, what for? - JACK: That's what I was wondering. KEITH: Oh, come off it. Frank was, well, straight. He had no worries I know of. It would have showed. JACK: Why would it? KEITH: Just would. That's all. - Frank was always the same. - JACK: Since when? - Did Frank drink whiskey? - KEITH: I don't know. JACK: No, nobody seems to know. EDDIE: He was a bloody good bloke. One of the best. How would you know, or you, or you? None of you knew! I knew! He was my dad! Okay, okay, okay. Let her go. Let her go. - I'm sorry about that. - No, don't worry. She's bound to be upset. - Let's have another drink. - No, I must be off. I should be at work. Well, look, look. Get your suit cleaned. - That's all right. - Oh, come on. - Thanks for coming, Eddie. - Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done. (CHATTERING) - Do you work here, Keith? - Yeah. If anyone comes in and asks for me, you let me know, right? Yeah, all right. I'm at the Las Vegas behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift? Yeah, he comes in here a bit. - Where would I find him? - Today? At the races. He always goes. - How come you know Albert? - I went to school with him. He'll know what's going on in this town.

On your holidays? - No, I'm visiting relatives. - Well, that's nice. It would be if they were still living. - Meaning what? - Bereavement, death in the family. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - That's all right, Eric. - Oh, well, small world, isn't it? - Very. So who are you working for these days, Eric? Oh, I'm straight. Respectable. (JACK CHUCKLES) - What are you doing? - Hmm? Advertising martini? - Oh, you've been watching television? - Yeah. Come off it, Eric. Who is it? - Brumby? - You're serious? Heh. Kinnear? What's it to you, anyway? Well, I've always had your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy. Well, that's not always a healthy way to be, is it? - And you should know... - Hmm? If I remember rightly. Heh, oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES) So you're doing all right, then, Eric? You're making good? - Making a living. - Yeah. Good prospects for advancement, is there, huh? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like. They're still the same. Piss-holes in the snow. - Still got a sense of humor. - Yeah. Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric? ERIC: Can't say I do. Don't miss the start on my account.

He's right. Tell him to save the money on the phone call.

And who's he? Are you still at it? Have you no thought for others? - We're going inside. - Why should I give a room to your sort? Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot. Everybody knew there'd be trouble... - when you moved in. - EDNA: Keep your trap shut. WOMAN: I'll send the old man to see you. EDNA: And wouldn't he love it? Where do you think you're going? Why don't you make us all a nice cup of tea? What are you gonna do? Make us a cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. - I'll call the police. - JACK: No, you won't. Well, now, Thorpey. It seems that I've got a secret benefactor. That's nice, isn't it, Keith? There's only one trouble. I don't know who to thank. (GRUNTS) Now... I wanna know who it is, Thorpe. All right, if you like, Thorpey, we'll stop mucking about. Somebody doesn't want me poking my nose into something. And I happen to know what that something is. Now stand up. - Who paid you to see me off? - Well, I can't, Jack, now, can I? - Yes, you can. - Unh! Don't, Jack, don't! Who sent you? (GROANING) Brumby.

Well, 10-to-1, it belongs to Cliff Brumby. Like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey? - Where is he living these days? - He's got a new place at Burnham. - Address? - On the Denham Road. The Pantiles. Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell is going on? - It's my house, you know. - Yes, Edna. And I must say, I think you've been great about it. - Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it. - Can I go now? Oh, you must be joking. Keep him away from a telephone. I'm going out for a bit. - Now just a minute. - JACK: Shut up.

BRUMBY: The Fletchers sent this man. BRUMBY: What? MRS. BRUMBY: I don't know who it is. I've never seen him before. What the hell is all this? Do you know what the time is? It's 2:00 in the morning. - I know. - Well? Wife says the Fletchers sent you. What's so important it couldn't wait until the morning? (CHUCKLES) Listen, I'm in no mood for playing silly buggers. I made a mistake. - What? - I made a mistake. - What about? - Never mind. It's not business? - See you. - I don't like it when some tough nut... pushes his way in and out of my house in the middle of the night. Bloody well tell me who sent you. You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me it's a full-time job. Now behave yourself. BRUMBY: Unh! JACK: All right. (BRUMBY GRUNTS) JACK: Good night, Mrs. Brumby. You sod. - They came back. - No. Look at this, you bastard. - You don't care a stuff, do you? - JACK: I'll buy you another one. What about the lad? They took him away. - What will they do to him? - JACK: Don't ask me. They bloody hurt me. You're lucky. They kill as well. What about you? Did you kill Brumby? - Thorpey nearly died laughing. - That old shit. What about Keith? What about Keith? - What are you gonna do? - Pension him off. You're a bastard. What am I supposed to do? I don't know where they've taken him. Do you? So shut up. What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel... who's planning to shoot somebody. You wouldn't do that. And how do you know I wouldn't? Because I know you wear purple underwear. (SCOFFS) What's that supposed to mean? Think about it. (BAND PLAYING "WHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN") Are you awake? JACK: No. Do you want breakfast? You must be joking. I never eat breakfast. Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. Did you sleep well? Yeah. Yes, thank you. JACK: Are you tired?

Sorry about this, Jack, but, you know, orders are orders. And what orders would they be, Con? CON: Well, Gerald phoned us up in the middle of the night. Said he heard you'd been making a nuisance of yourself. PETER: We've gotta take you back to London. CON: Said we'd be doing him a big favor. Oh, we know why you're all steamed up, and so do Gerald and Sid. But they, uh, have to be diplomatic. Now... take me back to London. Come on, Jack. Don't you think you ought to get dressed first? (BOTH CHUCKLE) Come on, Jack, put it away. You know you won't use it. Heh, uh, the gun, he means. (BOTH LAUGH) JACK: Out. Out. Out. Heh, if Anna could see you now. Now, Jack, be reasonable. You know we're gonna take you back sooner or later. JACK: Out. Mind you don't catch cold, Jack. I hope she's got understanding neighbors. We'll see you when you've got your drawers on. (GLASS SHATTERS) (BAND PLAYING "AULD LANG SYNE") - Do me a favor, will you? - What, and get myself beaten up again? - No chance of that. - Not much. - They're friends of mine. - And that'll make me feel better? Now, I don't want to get rough, do I, eh? Take that. Out the back door. CON: Hold it. Where do you think you're going? Strawberry Fair. In. Turn right. Open that door and go inside. What are you gonna do? Sit in the car and whistle "Rule, Britannia." EDNA: You're coming back? JACK: How can I stay away? (TIRES SCREECHING) (PANTING) - Where were you, then? - Oh. Bollocks. (DOORBELL RINGS) Keith in? Keith! What happened to you, then? How did you find me? Did they give you a rough time? No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back. No, I didn't. Does Albert Swift still live across the ferry? - Get knotted. - All right, all right, all right. - I wanna square things with you first. - Oh, yeah? How? Stuff it. My girlfriend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it? I'm sorry. Here. Get yourself a course in karate. (GROANS) (WHIMPERING) Frank said you were a shit and he was bloody well right! You even screwed his wife, didn't you? The poor bastard didn't even know if the kid was his! (TIRES SCREECH) (HORNS WAILING) - How were things between you and Frank? - He was all right to me. - Nothing more? Just another fellow? - Nicer than most. - But he was just another fellow, though? - Yeah. - Even though he was nicer than most? - Yes. I can't help the way I am. - Why did you see him so regular? - Heh. Once a week? I'd call that regular. He was gentlemanly. I like that. Once a week, you like a gentleman, do you? Look, I'm me, right? We are what we are, like it or not. - Why all the bloody needle? - What was bugging Frank? He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. But last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would've killed us both. He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street. I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him anymore. It was getting too dodgy. That was Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what he might do. I don't believe you. Frank wasn't like that. - I'm the villain in the family, remember? - It's the truth. It is, honestly. You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. - Now, who killed him? - I don't know nothing! Now listen, the only reason I came back to this crap house... was to find out who did it, and I'm not leaving till I do. Do you understand? Eh? (HORN HONKING) CON: Hello, Jack. You bitch. It was you who told them I was here, wasn't it? - Eh? - Aah! Peter is very upset about his car. He's gonna shit all over you. I'll catch up with you, Margaret! CON: You bastard! JACK: Come on, get me! (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SCREECHING) GLENDA: Over here, Jack! CON: Peter, Peter! PETER: Wait, now, hold up. What are you doing? (LAUGHS) You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you? No, frankly I didn't know that. A fairy godmother all of your own. - Aren't you lucky? - Yeah. So where are we going, princess? - To the Demon King's castle, of course. - Of course, where else? (TIRES SCREECHING) - How did you know where I'd be? - GLENDA: You were seen parking your car. The Demon King waived his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. - Lucky for you I waited. - Very lucky, I should think. - You're drunk. - Nasty. Whee! - He must've been pretty sure I'd come. - Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come. - And what was that? - We're there now. JACK: Thank God. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) BRUMBY: A new venture of mine. It's gonna be a restaurant. Do you like it? JACK: Yes, very nice. BRUMBY: Last night after you'd gone... I did a little bit of asking around, seeing as you weren't very forthcoming. It seems you're concerned about the death of your brother. I got to thinking how nice it would be... if the bloke you were after was the same bloke I wanted off my back. You know my life. Machines. The arcades. It's a nice business. It runs itself. People put money in, I take it out. There's not much rough stuff. It's a business that makes me very happy. Recently, though, I've had a spot of bother. One of my lads gets a little over-anxious... and flogs some machines to a club that's already got some. The upshot is I've got to eat shit... and start plugging my machines to other clubs. As far as I'm concerned, that's it. Apparently not. These people I've offended get the idea... that it would be a good thing to take over the whole of my outfit. So I'm worried. I can't fight them. I don't have that sort of a setup. But I've gotta fix them before they fix me. The trouble is, if I try and they find out, I'm dead. (LAUGHING) Five grand, that belongs to you... along with a little name I'm gonna give you. - What name? - Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear. Kinnear did it. - Why? - I don't know. All I know is people were shitting bricks up at his place last Saturday. Your brother's name was mentioned. Next day he was dead. - Why? - I don't know. That's all I was told. - That's not good enough. - Christ! What...? Do me a favor. Do you really think I'm gonna fix Kinnear on your say-so? Just because he put me on to you last night. Don't think you can play the same trick. - Stroll on. - Jack, you're wrong. - Good afternoon, Mr. Brumby. - Jack! (TIRES SCREECH IN DISTANCE) (CAR APPROACHING) (TIRES SCREECH) (ENGINE REVVING LOUDLY) (ENGINE STOPS) Who's setting you up in this place? Brumby. - Is he coming here? - Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant. - Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? - He won't. He thinks I'm simple. (JACK CHUCKLES) What does he want a great big country place for? - Entertaining. - What kind of entertaining? (CHUCKLES) Now you're asking. - Does Brumby really enjoy that crap? - Especially when I play the lead. (JACK CHUCKLES) Did Kinnear say anything about me... after I left the other night? - That's why you waited for me. - No, not entirely. - You're sure about that? - Sure, I'm sure. You bastard. (PROJECTOR WHIRRING) (NO AUDIO) - Glenda? - I'm in the bath. - I want to give you an Oscar. - Ha! You've been watching the film. - Tell me about the girl. - What girl? The young girl. - Who pulled her? - I don't know. - Was it Albert? - I shouldn't think so. - Is it one of Kinnear's films? - Yeah. JACK: Who set it up? - Eric? - Heh, yeah. - JACK: Then he must have pulled her. - I expect so. JACK: Did my brother, Frank... - find out? - Your brother? What are you talking about? JACK: You lying bitch! (COUGHING) Now tell me the truth. The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know. - And you didn't know her last name? - No. Well, it's Carter. That's my name. And her father was my brother and he was murdered last Sunday. Now get in there and get dressed. (WIND WHISTLING) Get in. Get in! Where's Albert? Where's Albert? I know where to find him. (PHONE DIALING) Eric? He's come for Albert. I don't know. On the ferry, I reckon. (WOMAN OVER PA) Number two, 10-to-1 now. The daily double... 3 pounds, 13 shillings. That's the double, 3 pounds, 13 shillings. And the last race at 5-to-1... JACK: Hello, Albert. Hello, Jack. I don't know anything, Jack. Yes, you do. Talk or I'll kill you. I know, I know. - Do you wanna go to the toilet, Albert? - Huh? Do you want to go to the toilet, huh? Do you wanna go to the toilet? (SIGHS) - You can't get away from me, Albert. - I know, I know. For chrissake, give us a fag. I didn't know who Doreen was. I thought she was just another bird. Did Eric Paice pull her? - Yeah. - How? I don't know. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret. - When did you find out? - A couple of weeks back. - How? - No choice. - Had a visit from somebody. - Who? Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen. - And you told Brumby. - Yeah. Who killed Frank? Do you wanna be dead, Albert? Last Sunday afternoon Eric and two of his boys arrived with Frank. They told me he'd rumbled. Somehow he'd seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They asked me for some whiskey and started forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest. What did you do, Albert? Nothing. What could I do? Did Eric know that Frank was my brother? Yes, yes, I told him. - What did he say? - "Good." They drove Frank away in a car. - Is that all there is? - Yeah. (KNIFE CLICKS) JACK: That's it, then. Jack, for chrissake. For chrissake. (WHIMPERING) You knew what I'd do, didn't you, Albert? Listen, Christ, I didn't kill him, Jack. - I know you didn't kill him! I know! - Aah! (GRUNTS) (WOMAN OVER PA) She is away fourth and last. Back in the stands, the circuit race. Siren's in the lead. Siren's six and... (DOOR OPENS) Put my two bob on Lucky Leap, please, would you? (BELL RINGS) (BELL RINGS) GIRL: I saw you. ERIC: Don't shoot, you stupid bastards! Kinnear said no shooting! - You're getting us all nicked! - PETER: Get stuffed! Now turn in it, Peter. Gerald wants see him first. PETER: Shut up! (GUN COCKS) Are you coming in or are you gonna piss about all day? You're bloody finished, you know that, Jack? - I've bloody finished you. - Not till I'm dead, Eric. ERIC: Oh, you've still got your sense of humor. Do you wanna tell him how I've finished him, Con? He's told Gerald about you and Anna. ERIC: He didn't believe me at first. Then Peter talked to him. Didn't even say goodbye. He just asked us to take you back, ha, ha. Alive. ERIC: He's probably talking to her right now. Are you still gonna fancy her when Gerald's finished with her face and that? (BIRDS CHIRPING) JACK: Stay where you are, Peter. Don't! Don't! Carter, your car needs a wash! (ENGINE REVVING) I don't want them cooking in here. They could put a hatch in that wall. Yes, well, I can do that, but it's all a question of design. Yes, aesthetically you've got to use the... Who in Christ's name is that? (ENGINES REVVING AND TIRES SQUEALING) The bloody madman. Extraordinary fellow. Jack. (GRUNTS) - You shouldn't have shown Frank the film. - I had to. - It was the only way to get at them. - You shouldn't have. Your brother was going to the police. Unh! You shit. You didn't have the guts... - to do it yourself, did you? - They'd have killed me. - They killed my brother instead. - Aah! I didn't think they'd do it. How would you have liked it... if that had been your daughter being poked in that film? - Eh? - Unh! What would you have done then? Slags likes your Sandra can get away with it. Can't they? The Doreens of this world can't. Can they? (CRASH) (TIRES SCREECH) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (CAR HORN HONKING) WOMAN: There's someone in the car! (SIREN WAILING) It's very rude to disappear like that. Where can he possibly be? (SIREN WAILING) I have an awful feeling we're not going to get our fees on this job. The guy on the swing bridge. Mm-hm. Okay. - How did it happen? - I don't know how it happened. WOMAN 1: How far did he fall? WOMAN 2: What did he say? Um, 19 floors I think it was. WOMAN 1: Really? Was he dead? WOMAN 2: Oh, yes. Apparently he hit his head on the pavement. WOMAN 1: He would be, then, wouldn't he, dear? WOMAN 2: I'm sure. WOMAN 1: Oh, well, it's best to go quick like that. (SHIP HORN BLARING) (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Number nine, Doctor's Orders. Five and eight, 58. One and five, 15. Two and six, 26. Three-oh, blind 30. Seven and eight, 78. Five and three, 53. Nine-oh, blind 90. Two and five, on 25. One so far on 25. Anybody else, please, for that ball bounce? Just the one? Nobody else? Checking just one this time. - Oh, it's cold. - Oh, it is. (CHATTERING) - JACK: I've come for you, Margaret. - Aah! (POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS) (CHATTERING AND LAUGHING) Who? What? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Hello. Gerald? It's Carter. Now listen carefully, you hairy-faced git. I've got the film and enough evidence to put you away for a long time. All it takes is one call to the police. Really? So? I'll do a simple deal with you. All I want... I see. I think that can be arranged. But I don't want him there until 6:00 in the morning. Okay? Right. Out. You want something, Cyril? Yes, Eric. A word with you. JACK: Get out. Come on. Come on. Take your clothes off. Take your clothes off. Keep your pants on. Lie down. Lie down. (MARGARET SOBBING) (SCREAMS) (MARGARET BREATHING HEAVILY) (MARGARET GRUNTING) (MARGARET SIGHS) I want you to listen very carefully. - Jack Carter. - MAN: Yes. Do you know what he looks like? MAN: Mm-hm, yeah. Hmm. Yeah. (CHOIR SINGING) (ENGINE REVS) JACK: Police. (MAN COUGHS) JACK: You couldn't win an egg-and-spoon race, Eric. ERIC: Sod off. Stay away from the car or I'll blow you apart. (GRUNTS) (PANTING) Stand up. Stand up. (ERIC COUGHS) I'll bet you could use a drink. Couldn't you, Eric, eh? Have a drink. - You've still got your sense of humor. - Drink up. Drink up. Drink up. (GRUNTS) I want you to drink all of that. Do you understand? Drink it all. Just like it was with my brother Frank. Go on. Drink up. (COUGHING) Drink up, Eric. It was you. It was you who poured it down him, wasn't it? Eh, Eric? What? What? Eh? (GRUNTING) Did you all have a good laugh, eh? Did you have a good laugh when he was spewing it up, eh? Drink up. Drink it. Drink it! Did you pass the bottle around when the car went over the top? Eh? Goodbye, Eric! (JACK CHUCKLING) (ENGLISH - US - SDH)
