You eat so much noodles, no wonder you're overweight. You're wrong this time, tonight it's fire-pot. Too bad you get off late, otherwise I'd invite to come. You're nice, if I was five years older. I've considered you as a boyfriend. Come on, I'm not that much older than you. I'll pick this up on the way out, where's David. Inside. Tuba, stop playing around. I've got some more for you to guess. "Scram" "Split" "Pull" "Bite" Ok, I give up. "Screw you" Tuba, you're in luck. We found a date for you tonight. Really? Thanks. Our pleasure! Come on, let's sit down. Tuba. Hi. Tuba. Hi. - Tuba. - Hi. - Tuba. - Hi. Nice to meet you, Tuba. Stay here, I have to go wash the vegetables. I'll help you. They make a lovely pair. A princess and her prince charming. Washing vegetables? No, roasting duck. Yes, I'm washing vegetables. Need any help. No need, I'm finished. You can help bring it out. Ok. If my wife asks. You say we spent last night in a coffee shop. No, used that excuse last week. Say we spent last night playing Mahjong. All done. Bring the Fishhead outside. OK. You know what? You wash vegetables beautiful. You'll make a good husband. Thanks. I can cook vegetables really well. We'll make a good pair, you wash, I cook. If my wife asks, we went fishing last night. Got it? What. Fishing. All done. Take all that outside.

I'm getting old, friends are propping dead left fewer. Water is boiling, let's eat. With last night on my mind, how can I eat? Where are you last night? We went. We were at the funeral parlour. That's night, at a wake. You spent the whole night at the funeral parlour. That's right, it got boring, so we played Mahjong. You play Mahjong at a wake? It was a happy wake. Yes, we'd a good time. Yes, two birds with one stone. Then we remember our late friend had... A special preference of fish. So we asked Ah Chung to come help us fish. Yes, we went to the nearby pier. To fish sea bass to honour Wong. To fish sea bass. It's hard to catch fish off that pier. It usually is, but our late friend must have spirit. We caught one at dawn around. So Big. Right, so big! Right, first the wake, then Mahjong, then fishing. What else can we do for the remember of a dead friend. Right, he can say that again. What about me? What about folk dancing? Why can't you folk-dance at a wake. Why can't you play Mahjong and folk-dancing. Why can't you fish and folk-dancing. I not finished yet. We were setting up the Mahjong table, we folk-dance. Because it's hard to book the folk-dance ball. We folk-danced at the funeral parlour. We folk-fished and we play danced. No we play-danced and we folk-waked. No, we fish-Mahjong and wake-danced... No, folk-dance! No, fished and folk-danced. Folk-Mahjong and fished-wake... No, folk-dance. You're a liar. What did I say wrong? You're a liar. Do you believe me? I believe every word. You're a liar. Don't be afraid. I know you're upset, so I'm trying to change the feel. Let's forget about the unpleasant past. And start our happy future. We're like these plates' vegetables. Both in the same pot. Let's enjoy it. Sorry. Am I intruding. You... Congratulation. Why, you? I'm moving back in... I've past my police cadet training. Help me. The veggies are very sweet.

Mr. Kan, your car is blocking my way. I'm going to get rid of it. Who is this? Is this some kind of a joke? Last time you caused on of our brothers to get arrest. The mighty detective is here. I'll give you one more chance. Bring US $200,000 tonight to TST star Ferry & wait. Before you report to the police... Mr. Kan, think about your family. What should I do. You did right coming to us. From now on, the police handle this. This bunch is getting really bold. If they find out, I come to the police. Will my family really be in danger? Relax! We'll take care of everything. Right. Trust us. Thanks, sir. Sir, let me handle this case. But those crocks will recognise you as a cop. That's right. We need a policeman who doesn't look like a cop. Where do we find one. Tuba.

Upstairs. I knew I should have moved. No need to drop me off. Bye. Bye. Why am I so stupid. We're friends, why be shy. I'm not married. I'm free to court her, get to know her better. With the increasing crime rate. Sending her home is natural thing to do. Ask her to dinner, it's a natural thing. Ask her to go to move, it's a natural thing. Ask her to go to bed, it's a natural thing. You sure? No problem on my part, just don't know about her. Sergeant, this is Tuba. A please surprise, sergeant. Sir, do you... I don't. Have a seat. Do you have a Walkman? Yes, I'll get it. I need your help. Walkman. Put it on. Sergeant said put it on! What can I do for you? I want you to take a bag to my wife lover.

Walk over to the guards stand by the pier. If you're late, I won't wait. After I hang up, don't say "hello". Kwai Chung container cargo pier. Sir. Sir, it's me. What are you doing here. I came to help you. To help me. What tactic shall we use. What tactic. In training school, the instructor told us. If we were up again many men, to attack head part. In other words, tactic "R.S.T." If up against few men, to surround the opponent. In other words, tactic "V.B.K." What tactic shall we use. T.R.T. What's "T.P.T" Try praying, Tootsie. How could the instructor didn't teach us that one. You weren't in the advanced class. If you really want to help. Stand aside. No, I can't who will cover you. Don't you know this mission is dangerous. I'm not afraid of death. If I should perish during the line of duty. Please don't cover my coffin with the wrong flag. I want to be covered with the Chinese flag. What are you doing? Getting your gun so I can cover you. Wait, go the blanket from the front seat. Why? Go get it...! Next to the driver's seat. Spread it on the ground. On the ground. Do it. Look forward. Look tight. Don't kick your blanket, you'll catch cold. Need a hit. Needed it hours ago. Hold on after you retrieve the bag from fatty. This is all yours. Want me to do him in? If there's any killing, we'll take care of it. Get going. Must be a tough fella, to mess with super cop's Got something for me. His voice doesn't sound so tough... Hand it over. ...You? Do you know me. I know you're an addict. How do you know. You scum... here, take this. Help...! There's no one to help you. I don't know what super cop's wife sees in you. Take it! Go on, take it. Help... Freeze. Don't move. Damn you... Go. Sir Magnum, how are you feeling. I have a splitting headache. Please, sir, don't die. That's what I keep telling myself, too. I didn't know third parts are so rough nowadays. He's not a "third party". He's part of an extortion gang. Remember them, remember me! Bring them to jail. I had my eyes closed. I can't recognize them. Don't kid me now. If you can't recognize them, I'll tell you. Just promise me you'll get them. Promise me. I can't help you. Don't depend on me, I'm sorry, sir. Ok! I promise. I offered to cover you, but you wouldn't listen. Sir, this is for you. Please don't blame me for what happened last night. Because I was confused, I speak something wrong. Let's just forget about the promise. What did you promise him? None of your business. Just promised him I'll be careful & look after myself. Stay in the police band and mind my own business. He died so violently, didn't he ask you to avenge. None. If he did, only you yourself would know. But never go back on your promise to dying man. What if I do? It's not my fault the world has problems. It's not my duty to pacify it. Fellow officers, we are gathered here today. To honor one of the bravest men amongst our team. Sergeant Rambo Chow. Sergeant Chow joined the Police cadets at the age 14. And passed training with honors. He later joined the regular force and served. Throughout the years, his exploits earned him his life. His brave deeds are numerous. Although we are gathered here to honor his passed. We should not be touched with sadness... Together with admire, with the encourage. Sergeant Chow's dead. We are very proud of him and in his memory. Any anger should be converted to energy. We had set Chow to rest. But his spirit shall always remain with us. We offer him our over-lasting respect. And the eternal promise that... We shall follow his noble example... Fearless in the face of death & sacrifice for people. Sergeant Chow, may you rest in peace. May I now call on the Commissioner to present flower. What are you doing? Take him away. Yes, sir. Take him away. I've never shafted any of my men before. But your behavior today is inexcusable... So I'm shafting you to uniform branch tomorrow. Sir, please, one more chance. It won't happen again. Let me show it. Again? Stop. Get out. Sir, one more chance. I gave you a chance! Now give me a break... If I don't shaft you, someone will shaft me. It's better that you be shafted instead of me. Besides, if I don't shaft you, my superior will shaft me. He might even transfer me. Then we'll both be shafted... So I beg of you... help me out... Give me a break and let me shaft you. Thank you, goodbye! Sir. What. You really shouldn't shaft me. That's better, the uniform branch... I'll give you some confidence. You'll seek my help very soon. Let's cross. Thanks. Bye! Why are you here? To watch you on your beat. Haven't you ever seen police giving traffic tack? What are you talking about you have a gun. Really you should hang around jewelry shop & bank. If there is a robbery, then your gun... Don't touch. If you meet gun-catching gang, you're in big trouble. They'll slash you from behind. Don't you have anything pleasant to say. Good thing is only two minutes to leave. 345, over. 345 speaking, over. Emergency call from College Road. Please response. Roger, over. You wish came true, let's go. Is it terrorist or maybe a hostage situation. I hope not. Take out your gun. You might need it. Not that serious, is it 345 calling control. What kind of case is it. Family dispute, why? Nothing, over. Son, come down, put down the cleaver, it's danger. Poppa's not dead. He's your father! No. Many Poppas. Let him go, we can talk it over. Poppa. Poppa? Do I look like Poppa? Poppa, give me a hug. Poppa. Son, put down the cleaver. Poppa. Poppa. Son. You cops killed my poppa! I'll chop you. Chop... Help. Let go. Tuba, get him off me. Let go, let go. I've finally got him pinned down. You've also got me pinned down. Have a seat. Those two escapes from the mental hospital. Have already chopped five, six people. Never would have guessed you two would bring them back. As your superior, I am proud of you. It was nothing, Sir. Actually all the credit belongs to 34567. I only know how to play the Tuba. That's not true. If you didn't act as a decoy! I wouldn't have the chance to pounce on him. It's really a waste of people. Sometimes it's not right be so generous. It's not right to play down your role to credit your friend. It also not right to ignore your own contribution. Why do you want to give me all the credit. - Cheung. - Tuba. - Cheung. - Tuba. - Cheung. - Tuba. No use being modest you two. I hope you two will continue to work as a team. As a team? I... You can go get a revolver. From today on, you're walking the beat with Tuba. Thank you sir. Sorry sir. Thank you sir. Tuba, tell dirty harry to watch out! I'm coming. Ready to go, sir. Where's your partner? Coming. What are you doing? Come on in. Wow... Looks like a chic. Not bad but not "sexy" enough. I'm bad at disguises. Sending me out will not attract any pervert. I'm not sending you out to attract... to catch. You two make a good-looking couple. Someone else will attract the perverts. Move. Get out of my way. What are you up to? Sending these two to cover. Is this a joke. Not my idea, just following orders. Any complaints take it to the superintendent. OK! Don't pull rank on me. Don't you two sleep on the job tonight. Anything happens to me, I'll hold you two responsibility. If anyone touches you. I'll be the first one there. What? You're going to wait until someone touched. Don't you know the rules. Is the scene have to get X-rated before you show up. I'm telling you, if any mate walks within three steps. And glances at me... you two arrest him. Alright, time to go. Who does she think she is. What are waiting for? Let's go. Let's go. Do you think there'll be any action tonight. I hope not. Don't you want a promotion? I just don't want to get demoted. We can get a clearer view over there. Nothing proves there's peace in this world. Perverts scout around before they attack. It was a close shave the other day, we nearly got caught right on the spot. Mary, let's get married! You're already pregnant. Let's wait and see. Why wait? You married that guy. And I'll marry fat Pat, then we'll have security. We can still be lovers. I don't know if I can convince him to go. I've already convinced my fiancee, why can't. Then we can rendezvous during our honeymoon. I'll go tell him I want to get married. Why don't we go get married. OK. John. You marry that English man. And I'll marry the Portuguese woman. Once we're setting, we can still meet secret. It's a deal. Let's go. Help. The pervert, let's move. Wait. What's the matter. If we go over now, the charge will just be attempted. If we wait any longer, it'll be a successful raped. No, wait a litter longer. If we don't go over now, it might turn into a rape now. If you don't move, I will. Madam. Are you alright. Where were you guy. What should we charge him with. I'll leave it to you. How about upsetting public relationship. What? Protecting the suspect. You don't seem to be all here. We're passed this supermarket many times. What are you up to. Show a little understanding to a friend in me. You'll cross this path in the future also. What path? The path to sweet romance. What? Romance? It's waste of time and money. I haven't spent any money. Just time and leg work. You should get straight to the point. The path to romance is best if you can fly non-stop. I know, but I'm stuck on a one way street. Hold hands yet? I told you, it's still a one way street. Hurry up and turn it into a two-way boulevard. Where is she. Inside. The supermarket. Low-priced merchandise. This ain't no boutique. Throw her on the shopping cart and roll her home. I can't, I don't know even how to ask her out. If you speak up, you chance is 50-50. If you don't, your chance is zero. Besides, woman are fickle. If you don't date her, someone else will. What excuse I use date her. Any excuse will do. There's so many items, just pick anything to talk. Also, the magic of cupid's arrows. Shopping. Yes. Help yourself. I will. Do sardines only come in cans. We only carry it in cans. Sardines aren't a good excuse. Does spam come in a bigger size. Yes, over there. How do I go from spam to "are you free tomorrow". Which tissue is the softest. We have so many, which do you prefer. Tissue is not the right excuse. Excuse me. Besides sardines, spam and tissue. We have many item I think you should come right out and speak your words. At least there isn't a generation between you and me. Actually I want to ask if you've free tomorrow. But I didn't know how to. Sorry, pretend you didn't hear what I said. What time is it. Half past seven. Tomorrow at this time I'll be off half hour later. If you want to date me, don't be late. Great. Ericka. You spent five minutes, what excuse did you used. Peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter and jelly. Yep, I told her I was peanut butter and she was jelly. And that we go well together. You don't look like peanut butter. You should have said she was beans and you were pork. And that you were meant to be together. Thank you for smiling on me. May you rest in peace for eternity. Grandpa, I know you like apples. But you don't have to eat it before my eyes. Please to smile on me. So I can do what I want. No. Bless me so I can be a top-notch crime-fighter. Goods for love, a chance to proliferate our family. What? Amen? No... not amen. Don't be scared. You... You... If I tell you I'm alive, would you believe me. You're really weak at heart, aren't you. And you want to be top notch crime fighter. Come on, wake up. I have to talk to you. To make it brief, the reason I came is to. Let me slap you awake. I confess to stealing money to buy candy when I was four. Played hockey at seven. Gambled ten dollars when I was nine... Peeked at my neighbour bathing at twelve. Don't tell me your life story. I came to. I give up, play games, huh! Listen to me, stop play acting. You've already cost me my position. Please leave me alone. You promised to avenge me. We might be starting a feud, why not forgot it. Forget you promise, I'll tag along wherever you. Where are you going? It's late. Boxing lesson. You OK? With that person tagging along, how can I be OK. That person...? You wish. He can't see me. You won't leave? OK, I leave. It's cold outside. Put on extra clothing. Follow me if you can. Something's wrong with Tuba. Tuba. Let's see how long you can tag along. Depends on how long you lead me. Don't walk too far, you'll get cramps. I can just float along. Don't wander around so late. You might run into a ghost. Never mind him. He nuts. Never mind him. If you dare, follow me into the temple. Hey. Is that the way to treat an old friend? Come on. Follow me! Come on. Are you possessed or something. Not possessed, but follower closely. Unless you become a caretaker at the temper. Or a monk. Otherwise, I'll stick glue to you. How dare you intrude, spirit. Stop scaring people. Sorry. Feel better. Yep, he's gone. Yep. I can see he's gone. He was horrible, blood flowing from his nostril. Green complexion, and that Casper smile. Let's go home to bed. What are you doing here? You make a fool of me. Joanne, is your friend slim of plump. Plump. Tall or short. Tall. Good taste. Dating me, isn't he? Let's wait and see. He seems better than your brother-in-law. When he courted me, he brought oranges. Twenty years ago, it was considered decent. Though now it's considered base. He's here. A token of my respect. Come in. OK. This is my mom. How do you do. This is Tuba. - Tuba. - Yes. - Please have a seat. - Thanks. Please. Smoke. No, thanks. You two chat, I'll finish cooking. Why are you staring at my mom. Just imagine how you'll look when you're her age. My dad's home. So late. Don't mention it, some jerk farted in the lift. So I took the stairs. If I ever see that jerk again... Daddy, Tuba's here. Tuba, my dad's home. Uncle. Daddy, I'll go help mom, you two chat. OK. Oh, it's you. Uncle, at first... Have a seat. Try it again and I'll punch you. Punch me. It has nothing to do with you. Really. Dinner's ready. Let's eat. Please be seated. Have a seat. Sit anywhere you like. Yeah, sit down. Are you all right. Sorry. Here, use this one. Thanks. Here's one for you. Again. Again. Don't. It has nothing to do with you. Let's have soup. What happened? It was nothing to do with you. What else are you serving tonight. A duck, steak and dessert. Skip the duck and steak, just serve the dessert. And get rid of him. Why. Can't you see he's crazy. Alright. What's the matter with you tonight. I... he... Never mind, drink your soup. Never mind the soup. Dessert coming. You... you... Put it down. Don't... Stop. Can you hear it. Let's leave. What happened, had nothing to do with you. Sorry it turned out like this. Never mind. At least you understand. Let's go out. OK. You go alone. I can't take you anymore. Crosses are for evil spirits. I'm a good ghost, so it's useless. Good ghost? You're ruining my life. You call yourself good. It's not as if I broke up your marriage. She's just a girlfriend. Right, and I was very lucky to have one. You spoiled it all for me. Why me? Hong Kong is full of Policemen, why me. What did I ever do to you. Tuba, when I died, you help my hand. That's why you're the only one I can communicate. That's why I have to choose you. You think I have a choice. If you keep you promise. I'll arrange not just one girlfriend. But many beautiful girls to be your girlfriend. I don't need so many, just Joanne will do. OK, you tell me! How can I keep my promise? How can I find that gang? If I knew, I would have told you long before. But we still. Have a lead... Is the money ready. It is ready. Take the money and get into your car. Where to. Central... Wellington Street. Someone will contact you. If... Is something wrong? Nothing I hope. Then, why we are here everyday. Just an intuition. I hope is a good intuition. OK!

Looks like the transfer. They are switching briefcases. What should we do. Follow them. Follow Kam. Kam is useless now. We should tail them. Tail a bit closer. We are closer enough. Get out of the way. Are you blind? Is a red light. He's right. It's a red light! What now. Go quick. Get out of the car. Tuba, sit tight. The car is over there. Hey, you guys over there. They are aboard the ferry. I sent for the speedboat. Let's use the cross harbour tunnel. No, too late for that. What should we do? Hang on. Tuba, hang on. Damn you, Cheung. Police everything's alright. Everyone in your cars. Tuba get over there... Tuba, you can't die. Right, not now. I will cover you, you go that way! Don't move. What's going on? Get down. Freeze. Drop you gun! Grab this. Let's get out of here. Where are they going. The swap went smoothly. But some of the guys were caught. Put the money in the box of fruit. I'll go talk to the boss. Well. It's done. See you tonight usual place. Only the two of us? Let's not. Let's go. Well, here goes nothing. So, it's going to be life or death. Fine with me? I've waited a long time for this.

Alright Do it if you must I sacrifice my right to reincarnation to support you. Go ahead. A ghost. A ghost. Where. Over there. She can see, she can see you. Thank you for helping me. You know, Joanne must really like you. Because actually she can't see me or hear me. You don't need my help any longer. See you in the after light. Tuba. Let's go to a movie. OK. Did you see any ghost. No, did you. Neither did I. Our poor daughter. I'm now a police constable. But soon I'll be an inspector, then commander. Then finally commissioner of police. You can get away. Tuba, give me a hand. Go ahead.
