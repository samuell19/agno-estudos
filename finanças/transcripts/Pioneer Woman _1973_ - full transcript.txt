( Instrumental music playing ) Woman narrating: March 10th, 1867. The events of this day have been extraordinary, indeed almost frightening. I had expected to live out the rest of my days here in Indiana. - Here where I was born-- - ( Bell tolling ) --Was married and gave birth to my two children. Within a week, I will never again be able to call huntingburg my home. It seemed like any other day most of the day through until late this afternoon. Jeremy was at school, as was Sarah. And then our lives were overturned. Strange are the ways of men. John and I have been man and wife for some 13 years now. Yet in matters of importance, he consults me no more than he does the children. And today, once again, he made this incomprehensible decision no differently. He hadn't a thought for my wishes. ( Laughing ) I'd intended to tell John tonight of my condition, my mind being fixed on this happiest of circumstances. I was pulling from the basket the things saved as Sarah outgrew them. ( Dog barking ) Whoa! Sarah! Ho! Jeremy! Come over here! Maggie? Maggie, we're going to Nebraska! - Where's Nebraska? - There's a man in town from the union pacific railroad. He's selling land for homesteading. Good land, the finest. No need to clear it and rich for the planting. - Where's Nebraska? - And I bought it. The whole 80 acres permitted-- that's only $4 an acre! Where is Nebraska? My geography book says it's in the middle of the great American desert. Nonsense. It's out west... On the prairie. Out west where the Indians are? Uh-huh! ( Laughs ) And I've made plans, Maggie. We'll take the train. They've laid track to grand island and we can outfit a wagon for settlement there. Our land stretches from here to here to here to here! John, are you serious? But of course! But Mr. Colfax promised to make the store over to you. You can't mean to give that up? Mr. Colfax gives hints, not promises. John, you-- you haven't handled a plow since you were a boy on your father's farm. Don't you worry about that, Maggie. What about the children's schooling? There will be. The railroad's building whole new towns for settlers. But what of all our things? The furniture? Well, we'll sell it, of course. It's our money in the bank for everything we need. But this is our home. I don't want to go anyplace else! Maggie. Maggie. Why don't you grow up and see things as they are? I'm a clerk in a drugstore... Living in a house I don't own. This is my chance. A man must have land. It's his only surety. And I'll never have enough money to buy land here in Indiana. Land of our own, Maggie. We'll turn it into an Eden for all of US. I'd best be going. We'll leave in a week. The children can miss the school year. No more school, no more school! I've gotta go tell bennie! I'll want to get a crop in. So the sooner we leave, the better. We won't be here for the maypole dance. But Clarissa and I have worked out our steps and everything. Seems to me if somebody's gonna do something for somebody else, they ought to ask 'em first. Now I won't get my new dress! Maggie's voice: John will be much angered that I didn't tell him of the baby. But I can't tell him now. But am I so childish not to want to go off into the wilderness? Why? Why must we go? How am I to ride in a wagon over rough roads carrying our child? A thought has just occurred: What if there are no roads, rough or otherwise, in Nebraska? ( Whistle blowing ) March 27th. Is it barely one week since we left home? The trip seems endless. The ride is uncomfortable and dirty. Oh, I ought not to complain. All of US seem to be thriving, even my secret companion. We have changed trains often. And of course, I've brought too much with US. John would be angry with me were it not for the fact that so much else delights him. Privacy has been unattainable. We share intimacy with the most peculiar fellow passengers. Jeremy, what are you scratching at? Come here, let me see. Mama, not in front of everybody. Ah! Oh, John, it's dreadful. Jeremy was harboring a louse. Maggie, did you see the buffalo out there just before dark? To the left. Hundreds of them. Oh, Maggie. Maggie, it's all so fine. ( Whistle blows ) ( Horse neighs ) Maggie's voice: April 2nd. We have two days on the trail now. The railroad reached the end of the line in mid-Nebraska and there we joined captain symington's wagon train. John has equipped US with everything for our new life. We even have a cow. The children have named her Jupiter. John meet ever challenge with pleasure, but too often, I fail at my new tasks. Oh, how I do long for the sight of a tree. John? Gopher hole. Take the reins for a while. I want to stretch my legs. - What, me, drive? - You gotta learn sometime. Oh, John, no. ( Dog barks ) - Oh. - Come on. ( Cow moos ) Know what? I have a surprise for you. Do you know what I packed around the China? That special blue dimity for your dress. - Oh, mama, really? - Mmm. But papa said to pack only important things. Well, your new dress is. Anyway, I bet I packed away a lot of things that your papa doesn't think are important. Maggie's voice: One can get used to things. ( Mooing ) Every morning while Jeremy and John cajole the oxen to their yoke, it is I who hitch them up. But fueling a cook fire with buffalo chips is one thing I'll never get used to. It does seem an unpalatable method of cooking food. The buffalo are everywhere so we are rarely without meat or fuel either. So numerous are the herds, the man have hardly to leave the trail in order to shoot. And even I have come to relish its taste. ( Firing ) Did I ever really have a clean wash-set of my own with a pump close by? It seems like a dream, as does so much of our old life. April 21st. Tomorrow we shall leave the wagon train. After 21 days on the trail, we go our own way. I find I rue less and less this great adventure, as John calls it, for as never before he is turning to me in the sharing of it. It is Jeremy's dearest wish that we will reach our own land on his birthday. Maggie. Be done with it. In a minute, John. Maggie's voice: April 23rd. Yesterday morning as the wagon train continued westward to Oregon, we turned southwest through this vast, empty land ocean. All the bouncing and shaking I and my precious burden have undergone these past weeks seems to have done neither of US harm. John calculates we should now be in reach of our own land. Oh, how good it will be to end this journey, to be in the land of our promise. Mama? Will people already be there? Oh, Sarah, you've asked me that over and over again. You know what your papa says. The railroad's gonna build a town - and a school-- - that isn't why i'm asking this time. That awful hat, mama-- do you have to wear it today? Sarah, it's your father's army hat. Anyway, haven't you noticed the look on the faces of the women at the homesteads we've passed? They're all weathered and hard. Am I gonna look like that, Sarah, in one year or two? - Ooph! - John: We're here! We're here! Well, you have your wish. We're here. Haaa! Haaay! ( All calling out ) All: Hi! Hello there! - Man: The welcome party-- - your hat. - How do? - How do? My name is John sergeant. - This the Seymour settlement? - It would seem likely. US four brothers, we're all seymours from back in Iowa. - Nice to see you. - I'm so glad to see you! - I'm Mrs. Seymour. - I'm Maggie sergeant. - And these are my three daughters. - Hello. - This is my son Jeremy. - Welcome to you, John. We don't get many folks passing through here. The women do need for some new gossip. - It's my birthday. - Isn't that a fine thing? - It surely is. - You'll be staying the night. - We'll make the room. - That's very kind of you. - We hope to spend the night on our own place. - Where would that be? Well, it's supposed to be east of that ground spring over there. Man: Those fields are all cultivated! Well, I don't see how it could be east. So it says on the map anyway. ( Unfolding map ) The union pacific supplied me with this map when I bought the 80 acres. John. Sarah? The deed is in the trunk. Go get it. Looks to me like you've been had by that railroad, mister. There ain't no land for sale around here. Never has been and never will be. Me and my brothers, we got plans for this land. I paid the railroad and I've got the deed to show for it. Sarah. Maggie, get on the wagon. Take the children with you. Keep them there. Here it is. My deed. We can pace the land out if you like. - It's all marked down. - Claim jumpers. You ain't jumping no claim here, mister. We've been proving up on this land for seven years. John, maybe we were cheated by the railroad? If you have a rightful deed, show it to US. I told you. I told you, Jordan: Go to julesburg and file on-- - hush up, Trudy! - You've never registered your claim? - Can't you never shut up, woman? - Ain't no matter! Our claim is the seven years of back-breaking, sodbusing toil we put in here. I put all my money into this land-- all my savings. Why, you're nothing but-- west of you, in Wyoming, there's homestead land aplenty. Now you best sign that deed over to US. No, this is my land. And I'm claiming it. He'd change his mind if we dunk him in the hole. John, for the love of heaven, do what they ask. We don't want no trouble, mister-- no more than you do. No. John! John! - Papa! - Ahhh! Papa! Papa! Maggie: Please leave him be! We'll go! Leave him be! We'll go! No, please, don't! You'd best promise to sign, Mr. Sergeant. No. No! Please, John! No no! Please, John! Let go! Like Henry says, you will! And better now than later. No! Let go! No, John! Ahh! Ahhhh! No! - Mama. - My baby. - You all right? - Oh, my baby. William! William! I done a terrible thing. The woman back there, she's aborting a baby. And I done it! Man: What are you trying to do, Henry? We don't need a corpse. I didn't know, mister. We-- none of US. We didn't know. Are you ready to sign the quit-claim? Oh my god. Yes, anything you want. Now let me go. How are you feeling? I feel fine, John. Truly. I-- I keep thinking how fearful I was of Indians. Look at our own kind. Thank you for bringing me away so quickly, John. Oh, that dreadful place. We must talk, Maggie, decide what to do. I want to know how you feel about it. We could go back to the rail head, make a complaint against those people. But that could be a long affair. I did sign that quit-claim. We could move on west. There's land-- a homestead-- in Wyoming. Not as good land as here, but... There's more of it. Well? We could go home, John. If... That's what you want. If I hadn't been so stubborn. You didn't know, John. Could have been your life. Sarah's. Jeremy's. The land-- the land belonged to me. It's overburdened me with pride. We must go to Wyoming, of course. A quarter section-- that's 160 acres, John. Can you farm that much land? Maybe not this year. But you just watch me. I'll go check the stock. Then I'll come back to bed. Maggie's voice: April 29th. The sun sets before US again and again, but we have yet to reach Wyoming. I do feel stronger with each day that passes and I try not to think of what we left behind in the prairie, though it is hard. John set some stones to Mark the place for me. I want never to return there. Whoa. I'll inquire in here. John, please take care. If anyone seems not to welcome US, it's best to go on. Sarah: Papa? Buy me some pink ribbon, papa? Oh, Sarah, papa's worried about money now. What do you want pink ribbon for anyway? I wanted to tie a bow on it. A ribbon for you, mama-- for your hat. Oh, it's beautiful. Put it on. They're king of wilted now. I picked them this morning. I picked some too. And you I haven't forgotten, Jeremy. I owe you a birthday cake. There, how do I look? It helps, I guess. You need your hat. Put this on. Maggie. There's a man inside named wormser. He says there's a quarter section above his place. Maggie, he wants US to settle there. Mrs. Sergeant. How do? I was telling your husband, this acreage just to the north of me, it's pretty good land-- most as good as mine. Same creek running through and all. Fox branch, I mean. If the mister would like to have a look at it, I'll ride along and show you the way. My, oh, my, ain't slim hall gonna be pleased? We been looking for folks to settle that parcel so's we could share in the harvest work. Man, it don't seem right, your walking and me sitting up here. Oh, no no, Mr. Wormser. I like the exercise. My missus will sure be happy to have a new neighbor, ma'am. Mrs. Hall-- they live down below US like I said before-- she's a fine woman. But them nine kids of her keep her pretty much at home. That be Robert Douglas. He runs cattle hereabouts. Good man for a rancher. How do, Douglas? - How do, Douglas? - Good day to you. This here fine family are the sergeants-- Mrs. Sergeant, Mr. Sergeant, this here is Mr. Robert Douglas. They're gonna homestead the quarter section just to the north of me. Mr. Sergeant's a sodbuster, like me. The rain's pretty sparse around here, Mr. Sergeant. The elevation's above 5,000 feet. You might do better farming back in Nebraska. We're here to stay, Mr. Douglas. Good luck to you, then. Now don't you pay him no nevermind, John. Them cattlemen, see, they want to hog all this fine growing land for themselves. I guess I'll ride for a while. Now get! Wormser: We're almost there now. - If you pull up, I'll leave you. - All right. Ho! A man ought to have some peace and quiet when spying out his land. And like the missus always says, I talk too much. You'll see fox branch right over that rise. I'd plant my wheat right out over that way if I was you. See what I mean? - Thank you, Mr. Wormser. - You're welcome, Mr. Sergeant. Ma'am. Well, what are we waiting for? Hyah! Whoa! Look. Maggie: Trees! Oh! Jeremy! He'll turn an ankle. Oh, let them be, John. Those trees will make fine timber for a house, don't you think, Maggie? ( Laughing ) We'll have US a sod house and be content with it, John sergeant. The trees will stand and be shade for you, I swear. Maggie's voice: May 4th. Our first day here. John was so impatient to begin, he left the unloading and went to his field to begin breaking sod. ( Cow bellowing ) Come on! - ( Bellowing ) - Come on, come on. Come on! Come on, come on. Go on! ( Jupiter moos ) Maggie? You'll have to drive the team. I'll need both hands to force the plow. - ( Jupiter moos ) - What do you want with Jupiter? The team can't do it alone. They can't move the plow through the sod. Without a horse, I have to use a cow. John, she'll go dry. Then she'll go dry! Here. Drive her when I say "go.' Take them. I bet he could use this. All right. All together now, let's go! Ho! Ha ha ha! Go! Hey! Ho ho! ( Cows bellow ) All right, fall back! Whoa! All right. ( Jeremy moans ) Jeremy: We unloaded almost everything. Sarah: Except the stove. It's too heavy. When are we gonna eat? John, it is almost noon. Yeah. We're gonna plow... About a half an acre a day. Almost as good as my pa used to do. And it won't be nearly as hard next year. Oh, it's hotter on than off. Sarah, after you eat, you're gonna drive the team. - You too, Jeremy. - Oh, John. If you can do it, they can. Here, tie it on poor old Jupiter. Maybe it'll make her cool. Unhitch the team, you two. Turn them out in the grass. Maggie's voice: The day has been a long one with settling in and field work too. But John would not rest after supper. He took the spade and the empty wagon back to the field and he began cutting and loading the bricks of turned-up sod for our house. May 9th. John never stops. He spent several nights leveling the floor and tonight he started laying the walls. I have never known a man to work so hard. It must be after midnight, John. Please stop. Please. I thought you were in bed. I was. Why must you push yourself so? When we're together, you're too tired. We scarcely exchange a word anymore and then you're gone again. Go to bed, Maggie. I must file claim on this place, soon as I can. We mustn't lose this place too. And I won't leave until you're under a roof. Maggie! Let me be. Maggie's voice: May 12th. We had our first company today. Mr. and Mrs. Wormser came calling. While he went to the plow to see John, Philippa and I visited. She is just beginning to show with child. Oh, my, it is such lovely China. Thank you. However did you dare to bring it with you? Well, I just flat refused to leave it behind. John thought me a dunce. Only one broke on the way. Come on, Philippa! It's almost milking time! Philippa? Don't do anything foolish. Don't forget yourself and do anything foolish. The baby matters too much. I'll be over sometime soon. We'll talk some more. Maggie's voice: May 18th. We have plowed and sown and harrowed in these two short weeks and John, almost alone, has built our house. But today, Mr. Wormser and Mr. Hall are here to help put the roof in. And then tomorrow, John is bound for Cheyenne to file our claim. Though he spares US all he can, he will not spare himself. I am an ingrate to resent it. My hope is that when he returns there'll be more time for US. He is truly the best of men. - Mr. Hall, Mr. Wormser. - Ma'am. I'm just about to ice Jeremy's birthday cake. It's a little overdue, but would you gentlemen stay and share it with US, please? It would make a lovely party for Jeremy if you could. They'll be back from fishing anytime now. Angel cake, I hope. Nothing I like better than angel-food cake. ( Jupiter moos ) I put in some antelope, John. And some bread too. Good. Remember if it rains, you and the children will have to cultivate. Otherwise, the water will go right back up in the sky again. John? You get yourself a good meal in Cheyenne. Yes yes yes. We'll miss you. Maggie? My little Maggie. So often I've said, "grow up, Maggie." And all along-- all along you already had. I'll be about six days. You'll be fine. Won't papa be surprised when he gets back? Lettuce, beans, potatoes and beets. Look how they're coming to life already. Oh, please rain. Oh, well, if it doesn't, we'll just have to water and water. ( Thunder rumbles ) It's gonna rain! Get everything inside, children, quickly! Quickly! Inside, children. Come on. Hurry up. Rain! Mama, the roof is leaking! Oh! Get the pots, quick. Go get Joe wormser and his wife. Mama, it's the man we met on the way here. Mrs. Sergeant. Mr. Douglas, isn't it? I think you'd better send the children inside. Go in the house, children. Is something wrong, Mr. Douglas? We were down in one of the arroyos looking for some cattle that strayed during the rain. We found him at the bottom of a washout. No. He must have gotten caught in a flash flood. No. You're wrong. It can't be. It's not John. It's not John. It can't be. Oh, John. Oh, John. Oh, no. Oh, John. Maggie's voice: May 26th. Today more than ever I feel myself an alien here. Everyone meant to be kind. But it did hurt me that there was no minister to speak for John. Can there be a lonelier place in this world? Mr. Wormser? John must have served in the war. Did he, Mrs. Sergeant? They've taken those years off the five needed to prove up. This place'll be yours free and clear in a year and a half. You think we're going to stay here without my husband? No, we're going home. This was all? John never said we'd gone through it all. Uh, how will we-- we need money to join a wagon train, to pay for railroad tickets. He left US the house, mama. And-- and the wheat. And land, mama. Mr. Hall? You wouldn't want to buy my milking cow, would you? Mr. Wormser, I'll sell you my wheat right now. All of it. Mrs. Sergeant? None of US got any money to spend this time of year. We're all living on the promise of Autumn: The harvest or fat cattle. Don't cry, mama. Please. We'll be fine. You'll see, we'll be fine. Maggie's voice: I cannot sleep. I am too frightened. I never did understand why we had to come. And now, without John, to stay seems a hopeless plight-- two children and a woman alone. I want to go home. Oh, John. John. Papa! Papa papa! Papa! Where's papa? - Shh, Jeremy. - No, papa! - Please, shh. - Papa! Come on, baby. Go to sleep. It's all right. Go to sleep. ( Wind howling ) Mama, would it be proper to ask Mr. Wormser next time he shoots game to get some for US? He has enough trouble looking after his own, Sarah, let alone US. Yes, ma'am. Here, that's fine. Jeremy, there were lots of times you watched papa load his firearm, weren't there? Yes, ma'am. Well, maybe together you and I could figure out how to do it. One thing he did say though-- if you put in too much powder, it blows up. ( Fires ) I guess we're still using a little too much, mama. Why don't you try a little closer? - You hit it, you hit it! - Whoo-hoo! Tomorrow, Jeremy, you and I are gonna get US some meat for supper. Look what I found in the creek. There are lots and lots of them in the dirt up there. - There are? - Did you get anything? - No. - Didn't you even see anything? Well, I saw chuckers, antelopes, rabbits. I couldn't get close enough to hit any. Look, aren't they funny? They're fossils, Sarah. Did you catch US some fish for supper? But they weigh like stone. Did they all have names, mama? I don't know. Can I make a collection? Can I? - Sarah. - To take back to show Clarissa. Didn't you even try to catch some fish? I forgot. Anyway, who likes fish? Oh, Sarah. I'm sorry, mama. Jeremy: Mama! Mama! Jeremy, for heaven's sake, what is it? Come quick! - ( Cow moos ) - Oh, no, the wheat! Shoo her out of the wheat! The wheat! Oh, shoo her out in the field. All: Shoo! Shoo! - Shoo shoo! - Shoo shoo! ( All shooing ) Shoo! Get out! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of the way, children. Don't miss this time, mama. ( Cow moos ) - Shoo shoo! - Go! Shoo! ( Screaming ) ( Hoofbeats approach ) That's our cow you shot. Your cow was ruining my crop. That's apt to happen when you farm open range. Come on, drag him out, Jake. How're you getting along, Mrs. Sergeant? Well enough, thank you. It's a pretty tough life for a woman without a man. It's a hard life, Mr. Douglas, with or without a man. Good day to you. Of all the patronizing people. Did you see him work that rope? I suppose we're going to have to have fish for supper again. There isn't any fish. There isn't any fish. Sarah, put your stones down and eat your supper. They're fossils. That's what you said. Right in my molasses. Papa said he was gonna put up muslin for a ceiling. Why don't we use the tent? Because we need the canvas for the wagon - to go home in. - Well, I don't see why we have to go back to Indiana anyway. I want to stay here and be a cowboy. I don't want to go back either especially. Well, what about all your friends? Clarissa? Clarissa's dumb. Sarah sergeant. She is, mama. What does she know about fossils? I bet she doesn't even know how to milk a cow. Mama, how much money is the wheat gonna bring? I mean, well, after we get back to Indiana, how're we gonna live? With your grandparents, of course. I'll work out somewhere, I suppose. - For somebody else? - Doing what, mama? Nana's always telling me to wipe my shoes outside, even if I'm not wearing any. Look, we're going back to Indiana just as soon as the wheat is harvested and sold. We're going back to family, friends and your schooling. - I don't want to hear any more about it. - ( Screams ) Sarah, shut up! You'll scare him. - ( Sarah screams ) - For heaven's sake, Sarah. Hush! Jeremy, get rid of that thing. It's only pompey, mama. He wouldn't hurt anything. And he keeps down the mice. Jeremy, don't you dare. Jeremy, get rid of it. - ( Hoofbeats approach ) - ( Man calls out ) Jeremy, get it out of here. From Mr. Douglas. We don't want any charity from Mr. Douglas. He says it's for any damage done. Wait! Wait! Mama, look. Meat on the table. Some of the time. Maggie's voice: June 17th. The garden has an endless thirst. Thank heaven wheat is hardier or we'd empty fox branch dry. But I am glad to be tired at night and to fall quickly asleep. July 9th. Today I shot a rabbit. Oh, I felt so triumphant... Until Mr. Douglas rode up. He of course had shot a large, fat antelope. ( Horse neighing ) You're looking very well, Mrs. Sergeant. You're kind, sir. Hey, Mrs. Sergeant? If you put your foot in here, I'll help you up and give you a ride home. Maggie's voice: So it was that Mr. Douglas brought me home. Tonight when the children were asleep I thought of the other homestead women, silent and dull of eye... But they luckier than I. At least they had their men. What matter if in Indiana or here? I am alone and lonely. Looking at myself, I wonder how Mr. Douglas sees me. I think perhaps if we were not going back to Indiana, I would make myself a new bonnet. July 30th. Only two more weeks till harvest. The wheat is tall and golden straight. It's glorious. August 14th. Tomorrow harvesting begins. We shall start at hall's farm, thence to wormser's, thence here, for we planted last. Immediately after threshing, we will leave for Indiana. Jeremy: Mama! Mama! What is it, Jeremy? Come see! Look! Oh my god. Hey, Mr. Douglas here yet? He sent down for slim and his boys too. Hyah! Whoa! Douglas figures we can make a stand here. Save the house, maybe. Make a stand? What for? That's a rip-roarin' death-bringer. A prairie fire, Mrs. Sergeant. And like usual, the wind's blowing right this way. Now get aboard! Douglas wants to form up down at your house. Hang on 'cause we gonna go. Okay, Jeremy. Let's go, Jack. Hyah! Hang on tight. Whoa! Whoa! - Ahh! - What about the team? - Let 'em free. - And Jupiter? They'll run ahead of the fire. Don't you worry. It's moving fast but with the wind's help, we've kept it from getting any wider. Looks like it's gonna top on that Ridge back there so that's where we'll cut the brake and start the backfire. - Backfire? Why? - That way, Mrs. Sergeant, we may be able to save some of your field. No! That's John's wheat. If you want to save range down valley, you burn off range above here, but not our wheat. Mrs. Sergeant, I don't need the range down valley. I can drive my herd over the divide and winter on the crow. It's the only way, Mrs. Sergeant. This whole valley could go. If this were your homestead, Mr. Hall, would you be so eager then? Ma'am, try and understand-- for god's sake, wormser, we're wasting time. - Go find a plow. - Fellas, get some flails. - Get some blankets, some sheets-- - no! Ma'am, Douglas has the truth of it. He doesn't need that range. But we need his help and yours or we're all lost. ( Men calling out ) ( Horses neighing ) Man: Hyah! Hyah! All right, get that team round again. That's all the time we got. Oh, Sarah, darling, not your blue dimity. If it's needed. Man: I need some more blankets too! Fire's coming hell-bent, Mr. Douglas. All right, ride the line. Make sure it's clean. Let's start spreading the coal oil. Come on, grab a bucket! Grab that coal oil. Let's go. Grab a bucket! Let's bring that coal oil. Come on, grab a bucket! - Here, I'll take that. - I'll take it. Sarah, get your brother, get out of the way. All right, stand back. Let's get back there! Stand back! You all ready? You ready? Ready here. Let's light 'em! Man: Is the firebreak holding? Man #2: I need help over here. Go over there near the firebreak! Over here! In the firebreak! Man: Behind you! The wind's taking it! We need more men! Over here. Quickly. Let's get those fires out! If it spreads, we're ruined! It's working. It's working. Man: Watch those embers. Man #2: Beat 'em out. Beat 'em out! Looks like you're gonna have a good crop in spite of it, Mrs. Sergeant. Oh, that'll do it. This'll be about the same as what we brought with US from Nebraska. "Good seed wheat," papa would call it. Mama, I could help sow it next year. I'll be big enough. Papa would be proud of US, I think. Let's go to town. Mrs. Sergeant? Good day, Mr. Douglas. Just wanted to say goodbye and good luck. Well, thank you for the good luck, but no need to say goodbye, unless you're going away. - Mama, mama! - Mr. Douglas, Mr. Douglas, we're staying! We're staying in Wyoming! And mama bought US some smoked pork and bacon and butter and fresh eggs! Come on, you two, in the wagon. I don't suppose you'd like to put that money into cattle? Run your stock with mine; You'd be welcome. We'd go shares at the market. Then we'd be ranchers and I'd get to be a cowboy. Jeremy, your papa saw his land in wheat. ( Horse neighs ) You'll get to be a cowboy anyway. It's inevitable. I see my land in wheat too, Mr. Douglas. I thank you. What happens if there's a drought next year maybe? I don't believe in borrowing, Mr. Douglas. Not money nor trouble. Yes, ma'am. Mr. Douglas? They say there'll be rails for fencing when the union pacific goes through. Well, till then, you best keep a sharp eye on your stock. Either that or you're welcome to come share a roast of beef with US some evening. Maggie's voice: August 21st, 1867. Today once again our lives have been overturned, this time by me. I have made an amazing decision.
