I mean I do this shit too, but it's like everybody just wants to use everybody else to feel good about themselves. I think that's what it is when you have sex. So you fuck somebody 'cause you're trying to prove something or whatever, but... it doesn't work. Like, I remember the first naked man I ever saw. I was like six or something and I remember coming out of my bedroom to get... I don't know, cereal or whatever and this man, like laying on the couch and like, I swear, his dick and everything is just hanging. 'Cause I don't fucking know, he's laying sideways or whatever. So I remember 'cause his crotch was like white. I mean like really white. Whiter than his legs and stomach and... I don't know, that just seemed crazy to me. So I'm just staring eating my cereal and my mom wakes up and I fucking think I'm going to get in trouble but she yells at the guy instead. Swear to God. Fucking woke him up and kicked his ass out. I felt ... You know I felt fucking bad for him 'cause I know my mom probably told him to sleep there. We still have that couch too. Have you ever seen a girl naked before, like, in person? Not really. It's Benny, right? You a sophomore, Benny? Going to be a junior after summer's over. You know you can come over here. Yeah, okay. We don't have to do anything. I feel like you're nervous. Nah, not at all. What the fuck. It's hot. Let's just, let's just go, let's go. I can't go, I drove the girls, I have to wait for them. - What? - Nothing. You can tell me. Joan said she's going to be here. She'll be here, it's Cherry's party. Yeah, we'll see. Ugh, Kimmy got fat. Shit. Hey yo, Willy, we got to go. - Lana, relax. - Just come on. - Lana! - Just come here. You said you wanted to talk. - Hey. - Tanya's here. - Tanya? - Yeah, here. Shit. I'm going to text you later, okay? Hey, bitch. - I told you not to fuck her boyfriend. - Yeah. What's wrong with you? Hey, let's go to Muchas and get chimichangas. Muchas is closed. Willy, Tanya is going to find you. Whatever. Hey, can you put the bottles down, please? You're going to get us pulled over. Hey, Ryan, you was fucking that Benny kid? Nah. I let him eat it though. I knew it. That's gross. That's 'cause Cherry's mom goes to church and shit. Shut up, she's basically a virgin too. Oh, she let that boy put it in. - Yeah, at Mac's. - Steve? That doesn't count, that was in like six grade. - Bitch, it counts. - It was like this. His dick's got to be bigger than a tampon to count. Man, whatever you were there. I'm telling you that shit counts. You know what, she's lucky she didn't let me fucking beat her ass. Look who is here, all my little chickadees. Hello, my sweet Candace. Hey there, momma. Look how cute you all are, oh my God with your halter tops and your chokers. Where you all been? You're all looking so fine. Yeah, okay. Most importantly, who wants a drink? - I do. - Mhm. 'Cause look, your cousin, she brought a bottle of vodka, she has a new job. We're just going to crash, mom. Hey, Jason. She's like a nurse's assistant which means she's working beside doctors, like she's working with real doctors. Mom, we're not drinking. I'm drinking. Me too. Then I'm pouring. Yes. - And you, baby girl. - Yes. Did you come to say goodbye? Oh no, no, no, I'm not leaving until after tomorrow night. Ah, okay, 'cause she's, uhm... She, uh... is going to... Evergreen College. Yeah, she's going to Evergreen College. - Congratulations. - Yeah, thank you. Ah. Try this. I'm good. You're not going to have a drink with your mom? I'm good. Hey, come on, have a drink. Yeah, have a drink, we're all having a drink. - Fuck. - Oh. What the fuck? Whoa, princess, like it's vodka, it's not going to stain, okay? I'm taking the fucking exit exam tomorrow, mom, I'm not trying to get lit. She didn't graduate. I was going to go for my GED, but I got pregnant. I still graduate if I pass. But you don't get a ceremony. Okay, all right, next word is premonition. Shit. - You got it. - I don't know. It's like when you can see or sense something before it actually happens. - Yeah, that's basically it. - No one asked you. Why the fuck are you even going to college? I'm not going after my senior year. Exactly, fuck college. Uhm, you're going to college. I am going to community college. I'm staying in the motherfucking community. Don't leave me. I'm going to be like three hours away. Yeah, but you're going to be in sorority, a bunch of blonde friends, names like Emily. Angie. Fucking Angie, yes. - Briana is stuck up. - That's the crew. Charity, Emily, Angie and Briana. No, no, she's going to go by Candace. Hey, Candace... White bitches love names that start with the letter C. I am only half a white bitch so. Okay, Ryan, vocab, please. I'm trying. Are you going to go to college if you pass? Heard that test is hard as fuck. I don't care about college. Then why are you making such a big deal about passing? 'Cause if I pass, then I get one step further than she did. So? So give me the next word. You fucking act like her. Fuck you, quit giving me shit, I'm thirsty. The next word is inevitable. I don't know. Got fucking marijuana all over myself. You're not a good tutor, bruh. - Shut the fuck up. - Ima take over. Hey. I thought you were sleeping. I was just getting some water. Get me one too, will you? Thanks. I was supposed to be bowling tonight. Where's my mom? Passed out. Ain't it past your bedtime? I'm not tired. Yeah, me neither. I'm never tired. I'm supposed to have a job interview tomorrow. That's cool. Sylvia wants me to wear a tie. I look so goddamn stupid in a tie. You ever tried it? What's it do? Whatever you want it to do. I had a friend who went to Evergreen College. He ain't done shit. Shit. Oh, shit. - Get up. - What time is it? Get up. Shut up. - Fuck you. - Come on. - No, no, no, no... - I want to go back to sleep. Too bad, get up. I'm so fucked. We got to go. What? I think he came inside me. What? Cory. What?

You just got to get your mom's signature on the FAFSA forms. Have you given your mom the forms yet? Not yet.

It's just I have a lot on my mind and like I still have a shit ton to do and then my mom just wants to hang out with me-- That shit is whatever, that shit doesn't matter, okay? - Doesn't matter? - Doesn't matter. Sure, yeah, totally. You know, it's whatever, it's just my fucking life, right? I don't know if you know this, but for the past couple of days, I've just been like steadily freaking out inside and, you know, like all I can think is that I want to be an engineer, I want to be an engineer, - like I want to make things-- - I know. I know, but do you know any engineers? I don't know, no? I don't fucking know what an engineer even fucking does. Fucking exactly right? So it's like I sound stupid because it's what I want to do, but I don't know how to do it and then like I start to get fucking tight and I just like-- Hey, hey, hey. - I don't-- - Hey, hey, hey.

I don't think you should feel bad just 'cause he crying about it. He wasn't crying about it. I'm fucking with you. I know. He did cry though. Damn. Hey Candace. You coming to the keg party tonight?

Exactly, it doesn't even matter for you. It does matter to me, it's important to me. I'm not going to do it, I would do anything for you guys I'm just not going to steal for you.

You forgot your backpack, you want to go? Shit man, I still can't believe this is actually happening. Well, it is. I know. Do you want to wear this? Sure. So, do you want to talk about what happened? Nothing. Dude, you like clobbered the fuck out of Tanya's face, like, God you punched her so fucking hard she peed on herself, like I was standing all the way at my car and then I saw-- I didn't pass that test anyway, so fuck it. I don't want to talk about it. Did you get the score already? No. So how do you know? Okay, okay. We don't have to talk about it. Do you want to know what I did today? What? - I just stole two cases of beer. - What? I stole two cases of beer, like I walked right in, I grabbed two cases, I ran past the guy who worked there and I jumped in the car and then Lana just drove fucking off. Okay. So then, what's going on? Nothing, Cherry. I don't believe you. Okay, well... - Dude, fuck off. - You fuck off. - No, tell me, talk to me. - Cherry, he fucked me. - What? - Okay, Cherry, fuck.

He helped me with my hand and, and then he was on-- I don't fucking know I was just fucking numb. And then his pants were down and I'm on the couch and-- I couldn't-- I didn't fucking know, I was-- And then she came in and saw us. It's not like they were going to get married or anything either, he's a guy, you know? He's just another fucking guy. Are you... I mean, are you okay? I want to do something. - Cherry. - No listen. I have an idea, I want to do something, okay? - Before we go to this party. - Cherry, I don't-- - Listen, no, no, listen, listen. - I'm really not, - I don't feel like even leaving now. - I hear you.

You're going to like it. Okay, come on. What are we doing? Just, hold on. - Okay, stay here. - Why? Just stand here and put this on. Just put it on. Okay. Dear admissions committee, as a counselor at a low income magnet school at a dilapidated fourth plane district of Vancouver, Washington, I have seen my fair share of troubled students. Children plunging head first down disastrous paths despite my best efforts to steer them toward a future that involves steady employment, a craft or trade in some cases, maybe even college. I found Ryan Reese amongst predictably bleak circumstances. - Cherry, don't-- - Let me just-- Let me just read this, okay? If we were judged by the worst things we had done, then we would be probably all be considered bad people. If you looked at Ryan's transcript or, she's says rap sheet, then you might be inclined to dismiss her. Another person in a long list that has attempted to exclude this young woman from one of her many quiet goals. What you don't see in that transcript is a vulnerable young woman. Vulnerable to the demands of a single parent household. Vulnerable to the psychological distress that accompanies a black eye and she has had many. Vulnerable to a school district that offers a fraction of the tools that a student who is blessed enough to live just five miles east has. She is vulnerable, not because she is weak. Her vulnerability is her strength. Despite the obstacles stacked against her, she arrives at the front doors of East Vancouver High and she fights for herself. She fights for something better. So... While many students will arrive unbridled to your university, anxious to partake in the celebration to discover one's self, this woman will be striving for a better life. And what could possibly be more honorable than that? I write this as a proud faculty member, reminding myself that she is the reason that I come to school each day. She gives me a better life, more fulfilled life. And I know that she can do that for your college also. Sincerely, Doctor Ellison. Ryan Reese, please come accept your diploma. - I love you. - I love you. Now do you want to go to this shit hole party, or? Yeah. Cory! Dude, you fucked that bitch up. I couldn't fucking believe it. She's like crying and like pissing all over herself. It wasn't like that. Bull fucking shit, Ryan, I saw that. Hey, hey are you with Lana? Sure. Wait, I thought that she brought you here. Let's just take shots, come, come, come. - Oh my God, do you want this? - I don't want it. God, fuck. - What? - My mom. You want to go? No just, I'll be back. Hey. Hey. - Hey, uhm, do you have that lipstick? - Oh yeah. - You good? - Yeah, can I leave? Yeah. Okay, I'm going to go in the morning. What time. Like eight. Okay, have fun. Oh my God. - You good? - Mhm. - Yeah, I heard something. - What? I heard you kicked the shit out of Tanya. Yeah, you know she used to be friends with my older sister, right? I remember when I was like 12, she came into my room while I was sleeping - and just like started pulling my hair like a psycho. - What the fuck? Yeah, I mean she could probably beat my ass, so I'm glad you did it. You get in trouble? Yeah. Fuck. So what about college? I don't know. Well, I guess you don't have to. My brother didn't. He didn't know what he really wanted to do so he just joined the army. Said the army was full of people who didn't know what they wanted to do. Just a bunch of like dipshits and stuff. Well, I don't want to go in the army. Nah, that's not what I'm saying. It's all right. You know I probably should go in the fucking army. I don't know. I thought about doing like hairdressing school or something. I just think it would be better than working at a Wendy's or something. I'm keeping it a secret though. Why? Because it's just for me. Okay. So you got secrets now. I'll tell you another one. All right. I've never kissed anyone. What? I mean I've never just kissed someone, like just a kiss. Hey Willy, it's me, I'm just trying to figure out where you are, so give me a call back, okay? What are you doing? It's okay, yeah, you're sexy. - Shh... - You're a freak dude. What did you do, what did you do? No. I just want to see, just a second, just a second. No, no, no way. So, I think maybe these need to come off a little bit. - Wait. - What? You said you wanted to break up, you said you want to move on and go do other things or. Yeah. But I want to. I'm going to put it on for you, okay? Well like, I got to get going anyway. My mom gave me a curfew. She's over at that Olive Garden on Milplane. Wait, seriously? - Yeah. - I fucking love that place. I went there for Homecoming once, I swear I had like 30 of those breadsticks. Yeah, I always make her bring me those. - So good. - And the Chicken Alfredo. I can walk with you. Unless you don't want me to. Nah, it's cool. I'm just letting you know though it's like two miles away. You going to be good? - I think so. - You sure? Yeah. Hey, have you seen Willy? Get up, come on. Get up. What the fuck? - Shit! - Yo bitch. Don't fucking touch me. Lana? Hey, lift your hips up for me, okay? - I'm sorry. - No, no, no I'm sorry. Lana, relax we weren't doing anything. Lana, Lana. Fuck you. Almost there, almost there, step. Good, step. Step, step. Good, good, good, good, okay. It's okay, we're going home, okay? Okay, head down. Here we go. This is nice. Yeah, my mom does commercial real estate actually. So I'm gonna... go. Where you going to go? I don't know. Like, you're just going to roam the streets, or? No, stupid I'm not just going to roam the streets. I'm going to... - I don't know just-- - 'Cause look, my mom's inside - and I can sneak you in right here through the side door. - That's okay. Look, just give me like one minute. Just go right here, and I can sneak you in. - Benny. - Look, just give me one minute, one minute. She doesn't come in here? I love you. You don't have to say it back, I just-- I want you to know. But, you don't. - I do. - No. You're leaving. Well yeah, 'cause I can't stay here. You know, I tried to take the GED test? Shit is just not for me. I know. Doesn't matter. You could always take it again. I'm not going to. Can I sleep here tonight? Yeah. Okay, just sit here. - I'm thirsty. - Okay, I'll be right back. Okay. Here, take this. Okay. Face up. You good? Come sleep up here with me. Lana? Are you sure your mom never comes in here? Nah, she always knocks if she does. So does she like wear suits to work, or what? My mom? Yeah. Sometimes, why? I don't know. You know, you can sleep on my bed if you want, I don't care. Where will you sleep? Yo, right on the floor. I got a sleeping bag. See? Right. Damn, this shit is comfortable. Hey, would you mind throwing me like a pillow or something? Thanks. So did you have Mrs. Lane for English? For like a minute. But I had to switch out though, - I kept falling asleep in her class. - Yeah, me too. Honestly, I could fall asleep anywhere. Benny? Will you give me a kiss? Yeah. - Look what I got you. - My god! What did you bring me? Oh, shit, like that? Dude, what the fuck. Why would you not get a bag? - This was more fun. - I don't know. Okay, give me one second. You know whose asshole moved to make us get up this early, right? Yes, I do. Are you okay? - I puked. - Oh, yeah? Everything go good last night? Uhm... Yeah, it went good. Uh... Guys, I-- I gotta go. Well, okay. I love you, guys. - I love you. - I love you. Hey, uhm... - Please. - I'm fine. Okay. - Okay, I gotta go. - Okay. Hey, be safe! Goodbye! Bye. I was thinking about cousin Nikola. I couldn't sleep last night, 'cause I was... thinking so much about her. I don't know how she just got so... used up by life. She used to come around and ask for 10, 20 bucks. Like I got any money. She just wanted to smoke it up. And she was getting beat up so bad by that Robert guy. But she wouldn't leave him. And then she lost her job at the cement company. Do you remeber that? I didn't even think you could be a woman and do that job. But it turns out all you had to do was take a truck driving test and... and pour in cement. And then I thought about us. How maybe... Maybe you've got to go through all the basd stuff first. You know, they-- Hit a rock bottom. Hit this like low. Only it's not low, it's like low low. Cause then maybe after that all the good stuff happens. You know? 'Cause like Nikola, she's got a baby now. And she's with this great guy. I don't remember his name, but... And she's got that nursing assistents job, and... She hit bottom first. Miss Ellison... came by. Told her I'd give you this. ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶
