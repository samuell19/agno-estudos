Like you, we’re puzzled by your son’s premature birth. This is Dr. Lin. He’s an infant disorder specialist from Cornell. I want to assure you both that there is nothing debilitating about your son’s condition. He’s totally healthy and normal in appearance, alert and quite happy. However, his cells are developing at what we feel... is four times the normal rate. Even though your son was only ten weeks old when he was born, physically, he was nine months and ready to leave your womb. Nature has given us all an internal clock. It meters out life span, controls our growth. Your son’s internal clock seems to be ticking... faster than usual. - But he’s healthy ? - Absolutely. I’m sorry. I still don’t understand. I’ve never heard anything like this before. Well, quite frankly, neither have we. There are other aging syndromes that we know of. Progeria, for example, which is very devastating to the child, but-- Jack’s cells are replicating at an unheard of rate. Is he gonna age like this the rest of his life ? Sir, this is only speculation. But, uh, we feel that at age one, your son may be physically around age four. And if this continues throughout his life, by the time he reaches age ten, well, he could-- Appear to be an ordinary, full-grown, 40-year-old man. [ Brian ] Are you serious ? Baa ! [ Dog Barking, Motorcycle Departing ] [ Boy ] That’s where he lives. Right there down the street my whole life, and I didn’t even know about it. I don’t believe any of it. He’s lying. Yeah, he’s not a monster. There’s no such thing. I’m telling you. He’s our age, but he looks 40. [ Man Breathing ] All hairy and everything. He’s like a freak or something. Just like in that one movie. Which movie ? Duh. Sorry. The one with the freak in it. What’d I just say ? Oh, yeah. I-I saw that one. He didn’t see it. His mom wouldn’t let him see it ’cause he has nightmares. I mean you no harm. Why haven’t we ever seen him then ? I heard he’s got all kinds of toys too. His parents buy him everything. If he’s our age, why ain’t he in school ? Because he’s dangerous. He’s huge enough to hurt other kids. That’s why they keep him locked up. [ Whirring ] Friend. What do you see ? Nothing. A teacher comes to his house every day. [ Jack Imitating Whirring ] [ Whirring Continues ] Jack, you’re not paying attention. [ Whirring ] Jack, you’re not paying attention. Don’t be afraid. I saw him in the store with his mom. I thought it was her husband at first. But he’s like a giant boy. He shaves and stuff. There’s no such thing as giants. Well, how’d he get like that ? Maybe his mom took drugs. Maybe it was that fertility junk and she was gonna have quintuplets, but just turned into one big baby. Doof. Oh, he sleeps up there. He’s a monstrosity. That’s why they hide him. No wonder they keep him outta school. Maybe they got him chained up. Maybe they only let him loose once a day to eat. Is that like a big pile of bones in his backyard ? Where ? I don’t see anything. Look ! Look ! [ Boys Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] Look out ! - We gotta get outta here ! - Oh, gross ! Come on, Louis ! He’s watching you ! Come on ! [ Boys Chattering ] [ Chattering, Shouting ] [ Groans ] Ow. [ Crying ] What happened ? What’d you do ? Where’s it hurt ? My knee. Let me see. [ Crying ] Well, it’s not bleeding. Okay. It’s not ? I can fix it for you. Okay. Okay. I’ll bite it. No, no. Don’t bite it. I really do. I have to bite it. Don’t. You’re gonna infect it. Okay. But this leg has got to come off. I’ll get your father’s saw. No, no. No, no. That’s okay. [ Laughs ] I saw-- I saw your butt. You did. Sorry. Let’s see. What do ya hear ? Nothing. It’s okay. How about the toes ? The toes are okay. I can feel that. Here ? I feel that. How about that ? That’s-- That’s-- [ Laughing ] Okay. That feels good now. I told you about those laces, champ. Yeah. Hmm ? Yeah. Okay ? Yes, you did. Sorry. So, where were we ? History. History. Okay. So, by the time he was 18, the young Alexander had already conquered most of the Greek city-states. And some feel that he had learned everything from his tutor... Aristotle. Jack ? Jack ? Hmm ? What did I just say ? Aristotle. Where’s Aristotle ? Book. Where’s Jack ? Outside. [ Mr. Woodruff ] I think what you have set up here is wonderful. I’m not trying to take anything away from that. I know you’re not. But to say that Jack should start going to public school is crazy. Yeah, but because a person is different, you can’t make an outcast of him. But we’ll talk to the principal. The principal will prepare the students. Mr. Woodruff, he’s got a 5:00 shadow. I don’t think he can fit in. I wish he could. Nobody said it would be easy. Jack’s developed defense mechanisms just like any child with a shortcoming does. [ Mother ] I appreciate what you’re trying to do. But Brian and I, we’ve seen how people react. We’ve been through this before. We just don’t want... Jack to have to face that. [ Mr. Woodruff ] Look at his eyes. His child’s eyes. Look at his eyes when he sees other children. His life moves faster than ours, but he wants to lead a full life, and I don’t think you ought to let it pass him by. It’s not fair. Marco ? [ Jack ] Polo. [ Laughing ] Oooh ! I’ve found you now. Aaah ! Got ya ! Gotta touch me ! [ Shrieks ] [ Laughing, Thudding ] "Would you two knock it off up there ?" "You better knock it off up there !" [ Chuckling ] [ Panting ] [ Door Creaking ] Marco. Polo. [ Laughing ] [ Mother ] Gotcha ! You’re it ! Honey ? Are you okay ? Yeah, I’m okay. [ Sighs ] You know, if something’s wrong, Jackie, you can tell me. Mr. Woodruff mentioned something today. What, honey, huh ? You can tell me. Mom, am I a giant ? No ! Of course not. [ Sighs ] Where did you hear that ? Is that why I don’t go to school ? Honey, I’ve told you. It’s lots of things. What things ? [ Sighs ] We’ll talk about this, okay ? When ? Well, not right now. It’s-- [ Together ] Time for bed. Brush your teeth. Put down the lid. Good night, Mom. [ Sighs ] Woodruff doesn’t know what he’s talking about. If he doesn’t know what he’s talking about, then why are we paying him all this money to tutor Jack ? I blame him, filling Jack’s head with all these ideas of going to school. Imagine that. A teacher wanting a kid to go to school, hmm ? [ Brian ] Where do they get such ideas ? [ Mother ] That’s how we do it ? Just throw him into school ? Mm-hmm. You know how children are. They make fun of the fat kid and the kid who wears glasses. What do you think they’re gonna do to the six-foot, hairy kid ? Mom ? Dad ? Jackie ? You okay, honey ? Something wrong ? I’m okay. Just can’t sleep. I had a scary dream. Can I sleep in here ? Yeah. Of course, buddy. Stimpy too ? [ Brian ] Sure. Okay. Oh. Hey. Easy. Okay. Come on. Come on. Jackie. Go to sleep. Okay. Good night, Mom. Good night, sweetie. Good night, Dad. You sure he’s ready for school ? Jackie will be fine. It’s the rest of the world I’m worried about.

Didn’t scare me ! This man hasn’t shaken so much since I was single. You got someplace to be at 7:00 ? Yeah, Rick, I gotta be at school. You’re late. It’s 7:05. Get yourself outta bed. I’m late ?

Ask him something. [ Whispering ] I’m not askin’ him. Louis ? [ Whispering ] Anybody ? Come on. Since when is this group shy ? All right, fine. I’ve got plenty of questions. Jack, when’s your birthday ? September 12. 1902. That’s enough. Hmm, let me see. Oh, what kind of foods do you just hate ? Broccoli. Broccoli. Yuck. Makes you fart. Anybody else here hate broccoli ? Hands. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, it looks like you’ve got more in common than you think. Jack, your seat’s right there in the back. Why don’t you sit down, and we’ll get started, okay ? Okay. Okay.

You heard me. You know what the problem is, Victor ? - You have "Zackly" disease. - What’s that ? - Yeah, what’s that ? It means your mouth smells "zackly" like your butt. Shut up. That’s pathetic.

I’m teaching you so you’ll learn something new, interesting. That’s all. I don’t care anymore. Is he sick ? No, I don’t think so. Then what’s wrong with him ? Yeah, what’s wrong with him ? He’s aging. Is he coming back ? I wish he’d come back. So do I. Yeah, so do I. Hey, we all do. Yeah. Yeah. What’re you doing ? Going home. You be back tomorrow ? This is yours. You can’t quit. I don’t consider myself quitting. I consider myself losing a student. Do you know why I like to teach children, Jack ? So I don’t get so revved up in being an adult. So I can remember that... there are other things that are important in life. Like riding a bike. Playing in a tree house. Splashing in water with good shoes on. And you, my friend, were my most special student. And until recently, you were everything I ever wanted in a student. You were a shooting star amongst ordinary stars. Have you ever seen a shooting star, Jack ? No. Oh, it’s-- it’s wonderful. It passes quickly, but while it’s here, it just lights up the whole sky. It’s the most beautiful thing you’d ever want to see. So beautiful that the other stars stop... and watch. You almost never see one. Why ? ’Cause they’re very rare, quite rare. But I saw one. I did. I just wanna be a regular star. Jack, you’ll never be regular. You’re spectacular. Mr. Woodruff ? Eureka. Yo, Mrs. Powell ! Hey, Mrs. Powell ! Hey, Jack’s mother ! Jack’s mother ! Mrs. Powell ! Hey, can Jack come out and play ? [ Sighs ] I’m sorry, Louis. He can’t. But why don’t you try again in a couple of days ? Hey, Jack’s mother ! Mrs. Powell ! Mrs. Powell ! Can Jack come out and play ? He doesn’t want to. [ In Unison ] Hey, Jack’s mother ! [ Sighs ] Jack’s mother ! Hey, Jack’s mother. Can Jack come out and play ? Girls, I’m sorry. He doesn’t want to. Can we at least see him, so we’ll know that he’s alive ? [ Laughs ] I told you. No, I told you. I told you. I said she wasn’t going to let us in. No, you said, "Yes, she is, let’s go." And I said, "No, he feels too bad." I said that we should not go. - You said-- - I told you. Of course, as always, you say that-- [ Voices Trail Off ] [ Sighing ] [ Ball Bouncing ] [ Boy ] Hey, Jack’s mother ! I know, I know. Can Jack come out and play ? Yeah, can he come out and play ? You are not going to go away, are you ? Hey, Jack’s mother ! I know I’m Jack’s mother. Yo, Jack ! Come on out, man ! Yeah, come on out ! [ Mom ] Kids, I’m sorry. I know he misses you, but he just doesn’t want to come out today ! [ Boys ] Hey, guys. [ Mom ] Try again some other time. Hey, man, what’s up, Victor ? Mario, Eric. [ Kids Chattering ] Hey, Jack, come out and play ! [ Kids All Shouting ] [ Louis ] Come on, Jack. Come on and hang out. Why don’t you come out and play with us ? Just like old times. Come on, Jack. We never see you. I miss you on the court, Jack. [ Incessant Chattering ] Shoo ! Go away ! Go on, everyone ! [ All Screaming ] Can Jack come out to play ? [ Dog Barking ] [ Crunching Cereal ] [ Jack ] Mom, Dad ? I’m going to school. Mom, please say it’s okay. Well, you better hurry up. You don’t want to be late. Thanks. Wait. Uh-- A peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Okay. Uh, Principal McGee, please. Gotta turn in my assignment. "When I grow up, I wanna put on about 250 pounds... "and be a rapper like Heavy D, except Heavy E. I wanna go to China and film a music video called ’Chubby.’" [ Blowing, Spitting, Grunting ] [ Class Laughing ] "Then I might want to be a part-time boxer, or maybe a kickboxer, so I can kick some butt." Louis. "I wanna be just like my best friend when I grow up. "He’s only ten, but he looks much older. "He’s like the perfect grownup, because on the inside, "he’s still just a kid. "He’s not afraid to learn things or try things... "or to meet new people the way most grownups are. "It’s like he’s looking at everything for the first time, "because he is. "And most grownups aren’t like that. "Most grownups just wanna go to work and make money... "and show off for the neighbors. [ Skidding ] "And more than anything, he knows how to be a great friend, more than most people who look like adults." It’s Jack. Jack’s back ! It’s Jack ! Come in, Jack. Jack, it’s so good to have you back. Sorry I’m late. That’s okay. Hi, Jack. Hi. Louie. Your seat’s waiting for you. We were just in the middle of Louis’ essay. Hey, Jack. Hey, buddy. Welcome back, Jack. Louis, you may continue. [ Louis ] "And more than anything, he knows how to be a great friend, "more than most people that look like adults. "So, I may not know what I want to be when I grow up, "and right now I really don’t care, "but I do know who I want to be like. "I want to be like the giant, "the big guy, my best friend, Jack." Thank you. [ Class Applauding ] Thank you, Louis. That was wonderful, Louis. Yeah, Louis, that was wonderful. Okay, class, let’s begin our lesson today. Turn to page 173. [ Class Laughing ] [ Miss Marquez ] Are you okay, Jack ? All right, everybody, that’s enough. Come on, settle down. [ Class Giggling ] Thank you. Oh, Louis, Louis. Come here, sweetie. Let me take a picture of you. Wait, come here. Louie, come on. Louie, Louie. Smile. I’m still payin’ for the damned orthodontist. Okay, take a picture. Come closer. Come on, come on, come on. Okay, here, Louie, sweetie. On three. Right there. Ooh ! Ooh, Eddie. Oh, my God ! Are you okay ? I’m fine. Are you sure ? Yeah, I’m sure. John-John ! George, what’s up, fellas ? Graduation, graduation ! Hey, Eddie, what’s up ? Let’s go. We’ll never find everybody. You always want to sit by Johnny. No, I don’t. Stop ! You stop. Please ! Please yourself. Okay, I will. Do that. I’ll take her, Brian. Oh. ♪♪ [ "Pomp and Circumstance" ] [ Growling ] [ Mr. Woodruff ] Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my honor to introduce... this year’s valedictorian, Jack Charles Powell. [ Cheering ] Thank you, Aristotle. Sorry. Oh-- Yo, Jack ! Go get ’em ! I got it, Eric. I’m cool. [ Audience Laughing ] My speech. [ Chuckles ] I don’t have very much time these days, so I’ll make it quick, like my life. [ Audience Laughs ] You know, as we come to the end of this phase of our life, we find ourselves trying to remember the good times... and trying to forget the bad times. And we find ourselves thinking about the future... and start to worry... thinking, "What am I gonna do ? Where am I gonna be in ten years ?" But I say to you, "Hey, look at me." Please, don’t worry so much. ’Cause in the end, none of us have very long on this earth. Life is fleeting. And if you’re ever distressed, cast your eyes to the summer sky. When the stars are strung across the velvety night, and when a shooting star streaks through the blackness... turning night into day... make a wish, and think of me. And make your life spectacular. I know I did. I made it, Mom. [ Laughs ] I’m a grownup. Thank you. [ Audience Applauds ] [ Cheering ] Come on, Jackie ! Let’s go ! Mom, it’s the guys. I gotta go. See ya. Not too late. Yeah, next Tuesday. [ Laughing ] [ Guys Whistling ] Let’s go ! Oh, whoa ! How sweet it is ! Mom ! Hey, guy, let’s go. Let’s go ! Come on. Yeah. All right ? All right, there you go. See you, Mom ! Yeah, let’s go. See you. Out of here. We made it.
