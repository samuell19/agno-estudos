We're all just passing through. For what? We don't know. They say life is what happens while you're worried about something else. And that we're here supposedly to be happy. Frankly... that sounds clich√©. And although there are so many of us, we're alone. What am I doing with this sign that says "FREE HUGS"? Well... I'm giving away hugs. Why? Because we're all running out of time. INTRODUCING LAURA Whatever you do, it won't stop. - Are you sure? - Yes. This envelope is for you. It's information about the person who'll take care of you. I'll make arrangements. I have 30 days to arrange certain things. A life insurance policy, and somebody it could help. And certain promises thatl have to keep. Okay, Sebastian, you know how castings work. Your name, to the camera. Sebastian Ramirez. Listen, what happened to your mouth? Stop getting into trouble, man. Right, profile. I heard your latest movie never opened, did it? Left. Now, give us a spin. Yeah, like we have all day, man. Now, at the camera, smile. As if you were doing well. Gael's movie opened today. Will you be going? Sebastian was coached by a true professional. He now has four movies in the making. Listen. Excuse me. That's not true! We have to make you stand out, you dunce. What part...? Smile, boy. There's a camera in front of you. Go ahead. Now we just have to get you an award-winning role. I don't know, a gay man, a mentally retarded boy. Better yet, a gay mentally retarded man. Wow. I'm brilliant, son, what can I do? - That's getting old. - Hi, Sebastian. Karla Jauregui is Kawachi's cousin. Excuse me, I have some ass-kissing to do. - Bye, dear. - Bye. - How are you, Katya? - Karla. I'd say I'm all right. What do you say? Yeah, you're fine. What are you doing later? Later? Right now. This is boring. Come on. Sebasfian! Come here, Sebastian. It's the premier. I feel fine, I feel fine Louden I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel fine! I feel fine, I feel-- Hold on, let me see who it is. - Yes? - I can't get to sleep again. - That's okay, come in. - You don't get it. When I rented this place you said it was quiet. - What are you doing? - It's really hot in here. You can write down your complaint and put it in the box. Come in. Go ahead, come in. Welcome, make yourself at home. Please, sit down. How nice, we have a new member. This doesn't happen every day. Well, let's all sit down, please. Come in. Please, sit down. Write down what you want us to solve for you. Well, I read your complaints yesterday. Raise your hand, whoever thinks they have a truly serious problem. See? Total success We all have our problems But they're not problems, they're opportunities for change! We're here because we're a group of happy, joyful people. We are The Optimists! Excuse me, I'm leaving. No, no, no. Why? Are you happy already, or what? Stay. Guadalupe, tell us your story. Remember you're not alone. We're all together! I can't go on living like this. My voice is too high-pitched. I have a female voice. The worst part is that women don't pay attention to me anymore. There, there, girl. I mean, boy. I want... I want to be a singer. Let's see, does anybody want to say something to Guadalupe? You're raising your hand. What do you want to tell him? Why don't you sing something? Sometimes singing helps when you're nervous. Let's make a list of the things we still have to do in life. We got away from my bodyguards! Like, yeah! Watch that pothole, I have brand-new boobs. So, where are all the paparazzi? Aren't they always following you? It would be so cool if you lost them now that I'm with you. - Too cool. - I know, listen. We could be like Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Well, third-world, obviously. We could adopt a bunch of kids from a village in Veracruz. - Right? - You're so funny, Katya. - Karla, stupid. Karla. - Karla, okay. Listen. Seriously, you and I have this incredible connection. You could fall in love with me for real. I mean, for real. Well, if you let yourself go. I don't really believe in that, but... What do you believe in? What do you like? I don't know. Listen. Why don't we do it in the car? Do you like that? Shit. Shit, what a crash. Help, help me! Please help me! Bust the airbag, bust it now! Attempted homicide? Stop busting my balls! Sebastian was only trying to save her. Look, Charlie. Under Articles 130 and 135 of the Mexico City Penal Code, all reckless crime disputes are processed where vehicles are involved. Especially when the driver is under the influence. But darling, in that kind of injury, the offended party can emit a pardon. There was a red light, it was his fault. It was green, damn it, green! I was a bit drunk, but it wasn't my fault. My career is going to hell on account of that Katya. Karla! How can you continue representing him, Charlie? What can I do? I'm a professional! Right, son? Don't listen to her. Look, I think it'd be best for Sebastian to apologize personally. The kids are friends. What do you mean friends? I don't even know her. Yes, but the girl is a doll. It was love at first sight. It happens sometimes, you know. Look Charlie, getting a minor drunk and risking her life is punished by jail, Sebastian. Your career is over! Here are the documents, period. Darling, come here, come here. I'll see you at the end of the month. Son of a bitch! We're going to trial! Charlie, both of us know it was the other car who ran the light. No, I don't know that, sonny. You ran it, he did, or I did-- it's all the same. What we need is for Karla to testify in your favor. Stay in from now until the trial. Sleep at a relative's until the end of April. April: my edible calendar. One a day. My victims. This one is the 30th. Tell me, egg, how does it feel to know... you're the last egg I'm going to eat? Oh, yeah. I have calendars all over the place. Made of matches, roulettes, buttons, Lego... Made of... everything. And my wall: April 5th. What should I do in the time I have? The Optimists said we should make a list of the things we want to achieve. Why not? TO DO THIS MONTH A list. Number One: Return the movies I kept. Damn. ls that all I can think of? No. I have to think of something better. Find a purpose. This is the first book my mother and I wrote. - Say you like the book. - I like the book. Give your brother a kiss. I made the drawings and Mom wrote the story. How can you get angel wings? Saving somebody. Here the angels says: "lf you save a life and you take care of it, you'll get your wings back. Finding a purpose. Save a life... and take care of it. Now that I have your lists, we're going to work in groups. Because problems are no longer problems when... You share them! Yes, let's make that list. I have a lot of things to do. Yes, because remember that you're not alone. We're all together! You and me. You're a classic, mister. Classics and newer models... are a perfect fusion. Mariana, didn't you want to make a list? Yes, I did. But by myself. Let's see, the atmosphere is turning negative. Everybody, stand up. Go catch her, please. Go on. Let's all sing "Woes Won't Kill Me." Listen. Why don't we try it? I don't want to, Mr. Arturo. I do everything by myself. Why don't we do a lot of things in the time we have left? I won't live past April. Really? Well, if you die before me, I promise I'll finish it up. And if I die first, promise you'll finish my list? I can't. "Save a life and take care of it. Shoutout all the bad words I know." It's incomplete. No, don't. Listen, that list is mine, give it to me. "Laugh till my stomach hurts." Don't! You can't write on it, it's my list. - Give it to me. - It's both of ours. We're a team. All right. It doesn't matter. It's not important anyway. I won't move from here until you promise to finish the list. Life can leave us at any moment. That's why we have to live it to the fullest. You have to find someone to finish your list with. Save a life and take care of it. Shoutoutafl the bad words I know. Laugh until my stomach hurts. See the Aurora Borealis. Give a thousand hugs. Jesus Christ, he's going to jump! Don'tjust stand there! - I can't believe that guy! - Go get a sheet. Yes, if he jumps we'll cover him with it. Call the fire department! Open up! You're hot! Excuse me, sir. How can I go up to the roof? Another stripper? Another one? No, no. How can I get up on the roof? - Boob? Bigger boobs! - No, no, no! A man up there wants to die. He wants to... - Harakiri? - Yes! What? Where? That way? A guy on the roof is threatening to jump. We have to help him, please. - Help me! ' Hurry, hurry! Climb up. Holy Mother! Oh, damn it, damn it! Fucking shit! Don't do it! I've got to be out of my mind! Listen, living is worth the effort. Okay, not always. Sometimes it's really messed up but you're only making it worse with your indecision. Will you do it? Tell me the truth. I can't believe this. I bet 100 pesos you'd jump. - What? - You have to do it soon. What do you need, a little push? I know. I'll count to three and you'll jump. Head first, you can't miss. Okay? One, two... ...and three! No, no, no! Are you going to do it or not? You're so indecisive. Look. Will you just leave me alone? Tell me what the problem is, we'll find a solution. You, you're the problem! The solution is for you to go. Okay. Sometimes it helps to sing when you're nervous. Here I come. Holy shit Stop singing! What do you want?! Not to be on this stupid ladder! - Help me please! Help! - Hold on to me! They're finally here. Give me your other hand. What happened? That creep threw her off the roof. - Help. - Hold on! Go ask for backup! Hold on. Okay, let's go up. Move, move. Hold on tight, come on. - Hold on. - It's going to fall down! Come on, come on. Stop right there! What do you mean? They're not moving. I'm the authority. Anything you say can be used against you. Come on, come on. Okay, move. Move. Good thing we rescued you, right, miss? Get up, you creep. Now you're really f... Hey, Chief. Don't use that language in front of the girls. Don't move. Under the authority vested in me by law, you're under arrest! - Be quiet. - Can't you see...? Good, Chief. It's a beautiful picture. Move! What is it? Are you all right? Hey. - Hi. - Where am I? In hell. We jumped off the fifth floor. Welcome. What are you doing here? You were charged with attempted murder. What? Who did I supposedly try to kill? - You? - Yeah. They couldn't find the keys... ...so they pulled the handcuffs off. You're not well. You're nuts. We both are. I ended up in this wheelchair and you're disfigured. Come on! It's a joke, relax. Your face is fine. Your eyes are set apart, and you have a wide nose. That means you're honest. People whose lower lip is larger than the upper are supposed to be excellent kissers. - What? - One more thing. Big feet mean something entirely different. What? - Nothing. - Who are you, anyway? What do you want? Something. She took care of him all night. How about a lollipop? Thanks. How are you doing, champ? Get over here. Your fake suicide attempt was a great stunt. It wasn't fake, I wanted to do it. You're shitting me. This will generate compassion amongst your public see? Grandpa said that when you save a life, it belongs to you. But you have to take care of it. We've been good to you, haven't we? Forget that, just speed things up. He has to get out as soon as possible. Would you like to be an actress, dear? No, she wouldn't. Did you get my glasses? Here. Listen, Sebastian. I brought something that will bring your career back to life. Great, my movie's coming out. No. These lollipops are going to be re-launched. They want you as their spokesman. It's great. What? Spokesman for lollipops? Stop shitting me. Will you stop moving the bed? Look, Sebastian. Now we must concentrate on the lawsuit. We have a meeting at 5:00 with the lawyer. - Can I go now? - Yes. No. Not until I drop all charges. Well, that's done. Son, son. Lay low, stop making waves. Try the lollipops and stop jerking around. They're good. Thanks for seeing me home. It's the least I can do. ls this it? Apartment four. Will you take my wallet out for me? I have to pay the cab. - I can't do it. - Yes. There. Keep the money from the bet. No, I lost. What's more, you are free of all charges. Good luck with your life. Ybutoo. Hey! - Conchita. - Yes, who were you expecting? May I come in? I need to check something... It'll come off with thinner. You fixed it up so... SO... beautifully. You're really talented, girl. I have an eye for talent. Well, I'd like you to use this desk as well. Just don't write on it. I got it from dad on my 16th birthday. - Where's your family? - Out of town. You should write to them. A typewriter makes you feel like writing letters. Will you help me? It's a biography of one of my characters. Will you type it for me? On this? "Roberta is a 30-year-old nurse." How nice, tea! I love tea. Who's Manuel? I had a boyfriend named Manuel once. I got fed up with him. He used to call me every five minutes. Sorry, did I hit you? I don't see how you can live with just one plate, one cup and one glass. What do you do when you have company? I never have company. Shall I stick the texts under your door? - Okay. - You can take the tea. No, you see, tea is meant to be shared. But, well, some other time. Bye. What now, Conchita? - You have my wallet. - What? Done? What did you...? Now I'm done. I'm done. I said I'm done. Wait there. No, don't! Wait, wait! I told you not to get the furniture dirty. Conchita will kill me. She's my landlady. Here, take this off. Gross. She's my neighbor, but she's kind of crazy. She talks to herself and comes over to... Come on. Man! Oh, shucks. SAVE A LIFE AND TAKE CARE OF IT April 10th. April 11th. And tomorrow, April 12th. Can I ask you something? I knew you would. Yes, it's me. But... Let's just say I look a bit different. - It's too much, right? - I only eat the whites. I saved you, so I need to ask you for something. It's no big deal, and it's quick. - It's... - Do you have a pen? Yes. Here. What? Your autograph? You think I climbed up that building and risked my life for this? - Nobody made you do it. - No, but I did it anyway. Who said I was going tojump, huh? "Once you're up there you hesitate." Sure you do. Where are you going? - I have things to do. - You didn't eat your eggs! Listen. Thanks to me you're not looney. My neighbor tried to commit suicide and now he walks around wearing a mask. I told you. - Are you leaving like this? - I have stuff to do. Listen, please. I need-- hey, listen up. When somebody helps somebody else, that other person is usually grateful and sayshanks for helping me, I've got goals to meet." I'm that somebody who needs help, I have goals to meet. I can't! Why not? Listen! You have something to do? What do you have to do today? You were going to be dead by now anyway. Okay. What do you need help with? Now I don't want to anymore. Can I come with you? It's notjust when you feel like it. According to your theory, I owe you my life, so I'm coming with you. Why? Please? - All day. - All day. No, half day. - Half day. - Then, forget it. Fine, all day. - All day. - Okay. Hop on. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Meme? Mariana? What about yourjob at the Ministry? My boss interrupted my literary career, for the moment. Now, I'm a misunderstood poet. Meme, Sebastian. What's up with him? - He's replacing Arturo. - What? Just hold on tight. What are you guys doing? - The green light is on. - Bye. Hey. Do you work here? No, we're shopping. Where is everyone? They're all gone. - Hi, Andrea. - Hi, Eva. Eva? This is my friend Sebastian. He's interested in your product. They're ready, over here please. The best view is that way. Let's get moving. - What are they like? - To die for. On this side, water... ...heaven, and hell. Here they are. Aren't they gorgeous? Of course, we have several models. This one, for example has a silk interior, which means it doesn't cause chafing. - I have sensitive skin. - It's ideal. - What about this one? - Do you like it? - What? - No. You'd look chubby in that. But that one elongates your figure. Please, come over here. Follow me. I call this one "Rest in Peace 5000. It's the ultimate. What's this button for? In case you're buried alive. Cool, huh? There are five other songs, one of them uplifts your spirit. A Christmas tune. Over here, please. You wanted to die, didn't you? This is the preparation room. We have state-of-the-art draining and refill technology. Those are the clothes we put on them. This one just came in for preparation. It looks like your friend saw a corpse. - Did you hear me? - Yes. He looks like he saw a corpse. - Are these really dead? - No, they're not really dead. They're asleep. You have to wake them up with a kiss. Is your boyfriend available? He's not my boyfriend. I'm giving him a lesson. He's my slave for a day. - Sex slave? - I need some air. Well, he should be. Sex liberates and exhilarates. It gives you energy, opens you up and motivates you. - Sex makes you bigger-- - Andrea, Andrea! He's going to hear you. I'm practically back to being a virgin. What? I've been so depressed, I'm even growing a beard. Look.Look! I'll be damned! - I'll be damned! - I have too much testosterone. I've tried everything, used all sorts of injections. I don't know what else to do. Why don't you braid it? That's really funny! Have you heard of The Optimists? I don't need therapy. Don't throw up on Mrs. Gutierrez, no, no! Andrea, is Mrs. Gutierrez ready for the open-casket service? Open-cas ket? Is that her? Thanks for cremating Pitillo, he was the best hamster ever. She's joking, these kids are interested in... Breathe, breathe. Here, smell this, smell this. Smell this. Watch out! Are... are you okay? Careful. Let's see. I swear it wasn't me. That one, I'm not so sure. Wait a minute. LAUGH TILL MY STOMACH HURTS ljust, ljust... Well, I'll be going now. I had a good time. Me too. That car has been there all day. Hey, hey, hey! Did you get the plate? - Can we go into your place? - Sure. Hello, Veronica. Thanks for typing my papers, Mariana. Listen, listen. The nut called you Mariana, thatjerk called you Veronica, and the woman called you Eva. Which is it? - It doesn't matter. - Yes it does. I'm Sebastian Ramirez and I'd like to know who I spent the day with. With me, nice meeting you. I don't care about names. But I do care about you! What did that mean about me replacing some Arturo guy? It's really hard to explain, you see. Look, I didn't plan it. I don't know how... You want to sleep with me for some strange reason? - What? - Are you from the press? - Where is it? - No, give it back! - Why, why? - Because I said so. Why can'tl read it? For your information, Mr. Arturo was an old man I was helping finish this list before April was over. He died because of me. And no, I don't want to have a thing with you. SAVE A LIFE AND TAKE CARE OF IT. I'm a bit... I'm kind of paranoid. I don't know. - It's okay, you didn't know. - Look. You've done two things on the list. I promised I'd finish it in a team. I'm not done yet. Look. Give a thousand hugs. See the Aurora Borealis. That's impossible. Who would have chosen that? He did. SHOUT OUT ALL THE SWEAR WORDS I KNOW Will you help me finish it? Only if you tell me your name. At the end. Can it be whatever I want? It can't be anything that hurts somebody else, they have to be fun... - All right. - ...and nothing sexual. - You said fun. - Nothing sexual. All right. Take a look. FLASH OLD FOLK DANCE RIDICULOUSLY No, not that. I can't. Something else. - You. - Something easier. CLIMB UP THE ANGEL MONUMENT - Can you sing? - Not a single note.

We have to finish before April is over. Only if you tell me your name. Valeria. APRIL DANCE RIDICULOUSLY OVERCOME OUR FEARS CLIMB UP THE ANGEL MONUMENT FLASH OLD PEOPLE With this, it's 365... You're really committed to the list? Yes. Does that fat lady count as two-- I ask you to hide at a friend's house and you go and show your ass to some old folks? Karla is here, if you're not here in 30 minutes... Okay, I'm on my way. All right, bye. I know how we can-- Your list is really cool and all, but I have important stuff to do. No hard feelings. - Good luck, bye. - What? Where are you going? - Good luck, take care. - This is important, too. Bye! In showbiz news, it turns out that now we've seen more than Sebastian Ramirez's back. Aside from being sued by Karla Jauregui, he was seen exposing himself in public in front of elderly people. What can I say, Charlie? Say something nice. I don't know, apologize. - Apologize for what? - Look... they're giving the girl a reality show. And she wants you to be in it. It's a good option. We'd have sponsors, everything. Sebasfian. She's waiting. I've been thinking, Katya... I'm Karla, you idiot! I don't ever want to see you again, creep! What's wrong? What's this mess? They had me followed, they're spying on me. That's enough, let's go. See you soon, Charlie. The trial is in a few days! Can I stay at your place tonight? Listen, son. If you're being followed, where's the first place they'd look for you? - What? 15 years?! - Like I said. Accept the deal, do the reality show and you'll be her boyfriend in the end. What do you mean? That's a lie. A lie that will save your life. Cut the crap. Look, go into hiding and think it over. It's 15 years in jail. I can't believe this bullshit... So, you want to die? We're going to make it quick. Get some life insurance. The beneficiary must be Ramon Lopez. I have someone who will get the job done. Write down the policy number policy on this ribbon. Hang it from the clock on April 30th. Then, there will be no turning back. All right. We're going to be watching you. This is not a game, Laura. Whatever you do, it won't stop. Here, please. I need you to write down your beneficiaries in the case of your death. Children with Cancer Charity, care of Ramon Lopez. Sign here, please. That's fine. Now, all I can do is congratulate you. We only live once, you know. "Like James Dean, the movie star accelerated. The traffic light was as red as the blood pumping through his veins. Nobody knew it would be the last day of their lives." It's excellent! It's excellent! Who did that happen to? To some guy. Whoever. Have you thought of publishing it? - Well... - You should finish a book and publish it. And you could You could even call it: "From Acts... to Actions"... by Meme... By Meme... - By Meme, what? - Wobbly. Meme Wobbly. What's your mother's last name? What? Woodcock. Meme Wobbly Woodcock. We have to get you a pseudonym. No, no. That'll do fine. We have to be proud of who we are. Don't we? Imagine if my name were "Meme Uranus." That's wobbly. Listen... would you write something about me? No, that's just for people who are about to die. I could improvise with you. Look. - Do you have some gum? - Yes. - Here. - Take note, take note. Look. I saw her coming. It was love at first sight. She had to finish her list, and I offered to help. What do those wounds hide? What other stories are hidden inside? What regrets, what triumphs? WHILE HE WAITS FOR KARLA JAUREGUI'S STATEMENT, SEBASTIAN RAMIREZ IS IN DANGER OF SPENDING 15 YEARS IN JAIL. Why did you want to commit suicide? You wake up and know what the rest of your life will be like. Nothing makes sense. You want to change something in your past, but you can't. The only thing that won't stop is time. I'm alone. So am I. Do you like it? What are you doing? You know what I was thinking? Why don't you write Karla a letter and ask her to tell the truth? - No. - Yes. You can type it. That way you can think out what you're going to say. No. What for? She just wants to be famous. What about you? Hi. I'm here to see Erica, of Children with Cancer. Hi. Hi, I'm Erica. Hi, I'm Valeria.

So badly. Shut your eyes. Go on. Hold out your hand. Open them. Your wings. You won them back. No, leave the key on it. - Good night. - Good night. Thanks. Are you okay, Valeria? - What's wrong? - I have to go. Where to? Aren't you going to get that? - Yes? - We have an arrest warrant for Sebastian Ramirez. Where are you taking him? To the D.A.'s office. - Sebastian. - Don't worry, I'll be fine. Do you have any comments? Please, a comment for the press. Remember what I said. Do that reality show, and you're free. Listen carefully, Mr. Ramirez. I need you to observe very closely... this photo of Miss Karla Jauregui. Take a good look. Do you acknowledge that you ran a red light on the corner of Mississippi and Lerma at 3:45 a.m... with Miss Karla Jauregui in the car? No. Now we will hear Miss Karla Jauregui's statement. - I need to talk to you, please. - Mr. Ramirez. Please. Officer, my client needs to use the restroom. Please, I can't stand it anymore. I have to go, too. Both? Bodily functions. May l? Did my lawyer mention the deal? I sent you some letters, did you read them? Which? The ones you wrote while I was convalescing and you were running around with that other chick? The paparazzi took photos. Look, I want to tell you that I don't care if it was you who sent the guy in the gray car. I don't care anymore. What happened was horrible, I was irresponsible. I shouldn't have taken you away from that party, I'm sorry. I really need to know if you'll forgive me. And I want to know if you'll be in my reality show. Meme! I have to go, because I wrote on Conchita's desk and she kicked me out. It was a family heirloom. Don't go. I've got it all figured out. You can paint, I'll write. I make 400 pesos per traffic light. And we have a place to live. Plus, I'm getting a motorcycle. - They're promoting me. - I can't, I have to go. Move in with me. Karla Jauregui. Tell us your version of the facts. It's true that we were distracted. It is. When we got to the traffic light, Sebastian accelerated. Your Honor, the traffic light was on red. Young man. No, wait a minute. Hey, I'm not done yet, okay?! You ignoramus. Right before we crossed it, the light changed to green. Then this idiot came along and crashed into us. You can't imagine, he rammed right into us. He totaled the car. Then, to top it off, the whole country found out about my boobs. That's the only surgery I've ever had. Write that down, the only one! You idiot! Okay, in other words, my statement is that Sebastian Ramirez is not guilty. Resolution: Sebastian Ramirez Gamboa is not guilty. Handcuff the guilty party. Thanks, Karla. I don't need you, huh? I'm going to do my reality show by myself. Write that down about my reality show. And then a soap and then, I'm off to Hollywood. Just like Salma. LGPS 9Q! Son, sonny. Congratulations. Why do you have to go? I don't want to be found. Over a desk? Conchita won't look for you, and I can file in your favor. No, I don't mean Conchita. It's Sebastian. What? Did he do something to you? No, he didn't do anything. - Then? - I'm in love with him and I can't tell him. - Sebastian, just a few words. - Security, please! Everything is going to pick up now. I have a campaign for you from the Canadian Scotiabank. You'll be back in circulation. Isn't that what you wanted? No, Charlie, I didn't know what I wanted. Here. Forget it, I'm walking this time. Take care of them, have fun. Good, he might've crashed and burst a testicle. Sir, will you say something for the press? Sebastian Ramirez needs worry no more. His case is closed and he is not guilty. On another note, today was the most polluted day in the city. The particles in the air will cause meteorological phenomena. So, can I stay at your place? Yes. I'll do whatever you want me to. I want you to finish your book. Good luck. What about those flowers? I'm diversifying. I can't live off a street corner. I'll buy them. Here. Keep it, gotta go. Thanks. Did you hear? She forgave me. Congratulations. These are for you. Thanks, Valeria. Sebasfian, there's something I want to tell you. - I've been thinking-- - Me too, me too. I realized it on my way over here. - Where is it? - What? - Here? - What? It's incomplete. Live? With you. Together. For a long time. I really like you. I'm falling in love with you. Please don't say that to me. Valeria. When I met you, I thought you were crazy. But I realized that... I'm the one who was nuts. No. I'm really not well. You taught me that today's all we have. You're right. Yes. Today is all we have. Did you see that? It's... The most polluted city in the world. SEE THE AURORA BOREALIS Manuel. No, please don't. Go away, what are you doing here? Laura, I care for you. I need to know you're all right. Okay, you saw me. I'm fine, now please go. And you're leaving now? You're going to vanish again? - No, Manuel. - Why do you do that, Laura? Please, move back in with me. What for? You were never there for me. Who's this? Tell me, are you going away with him? - No. - What's this creep doing here? - What's up, who is this creep? - No, that's what I said. He's nobody. Please, Manuel. Tell him who I am so he knows you're not alone. He can grab his things and get the fuck out! - Please. - I'm not leaving until you tell me who this son of a bitch is. The son of a bitch who's going to kick your ass! - What, creep? - Stop, Manuel. Manuel, stop! What's wrong with you, you idiot? Stop, stop! Manuel is my boyfriend. - Laura. - Be quiet. Your name is Laura? I'm an idiot. Don't worry, I'm the one who's leaving. No, Sebastian. Sebasfian! Why didn't you tell him who I was? Because, I don't want anybody to find me, that's why. Why are you leaving? You move from one place to another. Next time I may not get there on time. I hate time. I hate it! It's too late anyway, can't you see? No. Let's go, let's go away together. Everything will be fine. It won't be fine. It won't be fine, Manuel. It's still here, inside my head. I need, I need to be alone. I need to think. CONCHITA BEIS APRIL 25TH I have a surprise for you. Thank you! 20 KIDS FOR MY FUNERAL It's all right. It's all right to cry. Have a seat. You were right about telling the truth. I know, Charlie. When you first walked into this office, you were a seven-year-old squirt. Your dad said, "Here's my son, he says he wants to be an actor." Could I act? Don't ruin the moment! Listen, listen. There was a certainty in your eyes that made me want to help you. Charlie, I want to go back to acting. That's great, son! Great. I have something for you. The distributor wants to take advantage of this scandal - to finally open your movie! - Don't shit me. I shit you not. But, do me a favor. Try not to crash or run any lights. - Okay? - Thanks, Charlie. Thanks. I love you, sonny. Excuse me. Please, step aside. Laura vanished! Wait! Security, security! No! She's my sister! Laura! I don't know where she is. - She said you're her boyfriend. - She's always running. She told me she was going. - Is she with you? - No. What if something happens to her? Where are you going? Sebasfian! All right. Hey, where's Laura? I don't know. She was staying with me, but when I got home she was gone. She isn't here, either. Why? What's wrong? - Take me to your place. - Sure. - What are you looking for? - I don't know. Her brother says she tends to leave. She runs away. I don't know from what. "For my funeral"? "Save a life and take care of it. "Shout out all the... Laura! Laura! - I'll check here. - Laura! Laura! Children with Cancer Charity, care of Ramon Lopez. Who's Ramon Lopez? I don't know. She's not here, man, I looked all over. This is for you. FOR SEBASTIAN REMEMBER APRIL FOR MY FUNERAL What is it? "April 30th, the clock at the park." "Right in the heart." We have to finish before April is over. Shit! Lend me your vest. What should we do? Go home in case she stops by. Whatever you do, it won't stop. Why? I was driving. We had picked up my little brother who'd spent the weekend in the hospital. I was distracted and crashed. I don't like to be Laura because Laura killed her family, don't you see? My brother wasn't killed by the cancer, it was me. - No, it was an accident. - It was me! It was an accident. Come, listen to me. Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself. Here. It was an accident. I have to die for those children to survive. But I'm scared. I'm so scared. I don't want to die! Come on, let's go. What? What's wrong? Relax, please, listen to me. Don't. It's only me he wants. I'm not leaving you alone. If you're going to shoot, shoot me! No! Laura! Laura, talk to me! Laura. Laura! Because we're all just passing through. For what? To accept ourselves. To write our own story. To achieve something we've always dreamed of. Cut! - Did you like it, Mr. Director? - It was great. - What did you think, Charlie? - Let's play that back. Let's sing! To help. THE OPTIMISTS To give somebody else a chance to start over. Thank you for your help! Even to who least expects it. DONATION GIVES TRANSPLANTS TO 2O KIDS To make a list of things you want to achieve.
