Wow. Look at that house over there. This is a new, upcoming waterfront development. - Oh. - Oh, wow. Everything's new. And I love the flow. You have two lifts already built in... - That's amazing. - ...a nice big boathouse. Tons of yard space. Look at that view. That is beautiful. This is what I'm talking about. ¶¶ - All right. - Awesome shot. We're from Dublin, Ohio, and we're looking to move to beautiful Indian Lake. - Nice shot! - Look at that now! We have a daughter, Mallory. She'll be a senior in high school this year which means she'll be going off to college, and we're hoping that as she gets older this will be a place that she'll want to keep coming back to, to visit us. Hitting balls, hanging out, this is great. ¶¶ Wow. Will you bring me here... - You hit this one. - ...so we can practice? Anytime. Coming to Indian Lake is gonna be great for us and our family. The people are so lovely. The water views are fantastic, and it's just such a relaxed, slower pace of life. This is a cab. Oh. That's really good. Right now, we have two dogs. We have Gigi, who's a pug, and Winston, who's a chiweenie. We really enjoy rescuing dogs, and we bring them in and get them healthy again, and then we give them to a good home. Those are local wines out of Columbus Grove, Ohio. Oh, okay. But we have wines from all over the country. I'm a yoga-studio manager. And I'm a small business owner. Jim runs a plastic-injection molding facility. He builds plastic parts, any and everything you can think of that's plastic. There's a lot of ups and downs in being a small business owner. Finding a place here in Indian Lake and being able to relax and unwind is gonna be great. ¶¶ Located in west central Ohio, Indian Lake is a quaint community surrounding the nearly 6,000-acre man-made lake, making it a boater's paradise. You can do kayaking, sailing, swim at the beach access. I come to Indian Lake for the fishing. Indian Lake is known for its waterfront restaurants. Pull right up. Dock your boat. My favorite thing to do at Indian Lake is probably tubing. We love to go jet skiing, hang out on the boat, go to the sandbar and sometimes come to the driving range. You can always find a really nice spot somewhere out on the peninsula, having maybe low country boil and enjoying some good friends and family. - This place is beautiful. - Isn't it? - Do you come here a lot? - Yeah. It's such a classy place, like, low-key. - You're gonna love it here. - Yeah. - I'm really excited. - Can't wait. - Good. - Cannot wait. Well, tell me. What are you guys looking for? Ideally, I would love a home on the water. Just to be able to get up in the mornings and look out and see that. - Water, water, and more water. - So you want open water view. - Yes. - Okay. Do you think we're looking for a home with a dock? We're gonna look at a pontoon boat, some other things. - We're gonna need that. - Okay. Tell me how many beds and baths you're looking for. 3 to 4 bedrooms and 2 to 3 baths. Okay. We'll have lots of family and friends that I know are gonna want to come and visit. Sure. Yeah, we love to entertain. We actively rescue and foster dogs. Mm-hmm. Ideally, I would love a house that had some land that we would be able to do that, maybe put a fence in or just have that ability to have that at some point. Okay, yeah. We'd like to look at homes priced between $650,000 and $750,000. Anything over $750,000 would have to be pretty much turnkey. Would you be open to doing some renovation? - Possibly some. - Okay. Well, I will pull some things out of our inventory, and we'll set up some showings, and we'll go from there. Perfect. We're really excited. Sounds great. - Yeah. All right, dig in. - Thanks so much. - Let's eat. - Yeah, this is good. Thank you. Jim and Angie are all about having a waterfront home with a yard, and that's why I'm showing them the Cranberry Bay house. This property is located on Shawnee Island which is on Indian Isles, the string of islands that juts out into the middle of the lake. Wow, Paige. This is a beautiful home. I love the double-car garage, the red detail for the roof there that matches the brick so nicely. - How big is this? - The lot is actually 0.16 acres. And it has over 70 feet of waterfront here. This is a 4-bedroom, 3-bathroom home, 3,109 square feet. The list price is $649,900. That'd be good. And it also has a really nice boat dock... Really? ...with electric lifts so... - Okay. All right. Well, go check it out. All right. I really like the landscaping. Yeah. The landscaping is perfect. Oh, wow. This is a nice-size living space, too, and there's your giant TV. Maybe that'll come with the house. - What do you think? - Maybe. Huh, never know. I'm not a fan of the color. Maybe with our style, though, we could change it up a little bit and brighten it up. - I would think so. And this furniture looks incredibly comfortable, but maybe we could switch this out for a lighter color? - Yeah. The view is great. - Yeah. We could open this up and just really see the outside. Right. This kitchen is fantastic. I love how it's all open to the living area, and I love the size of this island. Everybody seems to migrate to the kitchen. - They do. - So this is a really good setup. Everything looks like it's in great condition, plenty of storage. I mean, it's a little dark. When you say, "Lake house," I'm thinking brighter colors and everything like that. Right. I mean, with that little bit of extra money, paint is cheap so... - Yeah. - Paint is just cosmetic. - Right. Carpet looks like it's in great condition. - Yeah. - I like the nice, neutral color. I really like that this is a two-story home. I do, too. - Oh, and look at this. - Oh. This is a great-size room. That looks like a king-size bed. You think Mallory in here probably? Yeah. This is the perfect size for her. We could do a couple bunk beds... - Couple bunk beds. - ...for friends. I think this would work. All this extra storage space here. Oh, wow. You would never guess this room would be up here. - What a great bonus room. - Yeah. Look at the views out there to the water. Oh, cannot get enough of that view. This is such a big space. I mean, you could almost put a pool table up here if you wanted to. - Yeah. This could be a office/game room. - Oh. - What do we have? Here's the bathroom. There's carpet in the bathroom. We'd have to tile it. The light fixture is new. The faucet is new. Everything is pretty much updated. And look at the walls. I mean... Is that a wallpaper or... I think they painted this. Yeah, that looks like a faux. It's like a faux finish. Mm-hmm, and I like the extended shower curtain there, gives you a little bit more space inside. Sure. - Yeah. - Not bad. Oh, and look at the French doors leading into the master bedroom. Ooh. It's really nice. Got a king-size bed, and we've got plenty of room. Love the view. Yeah, I can't get enough of that, and maybe we could even put a bright color paint on these walls in here. Yeah, I think it would brighten it all up. Mm-hmm. - Look at this. - Whoa. Double sinks, plenty of room for us. Mm-hmm. The lightings are all updated, the faucets. Countertop looks great. - Yeah. - This is really nice. I could spend a lot of time in here. - I wouldn't do too much time. - Yeah. Oh, wow. Look at the view. It's fun to look out here and see all of these other beautiful homes. - Has an awning. - Oh, yeah. It'd be nice to maybe do an outdoor dining area. I love that we've got some grass. I'm not sure if it's gonna be enough for the dogs. Right. How awesome is that? You have two lifts already built in... - That's amazing. - ...a nice big boathouse. That's a real added bonus here, too, isn't it? For sure. So how did it go? Oh, it's great. It's a beautiful home. - Yeah. - These views are to die for. Love the boathouse. That's key. And I love the kitchen space. I love that giant island in the middle. That's perfect for entertaining. The yard is a little small. So that might pose some problems with the dogs. Sure. There's not much I would change here. - No. - Maybe painting. Bring in some brighter, beachier colors. Considering the views and the price, we would definitely like to keep this as an option. Okay. Let's go see more. - Okay. - Sounds great. - That'd be great. - All right. ¶¶ The next house I want to bring Jim and Angie to is the Dragonfly House. I think they would be happy if they could avoid renovation projects which is why I want to show them something brand-new. This home is located in the private waterfront gated community of Longview Cove. I love this house. It is so cute and charming. This is a new, upcoming waterfront development. It has a ton of amenities, a clubhouse, fitness center, a saltwater pool, and then they take care of your lawn care and your landscaping. How much are the fees? - It's $195 a month. - Okay. - Wow. - How many bedrooms is this? 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, 2,600 square feet. Okay. And it's $650,000. Yeah, that'll work. The basement is actually a walk-out basement... Oh. ...so you can walk straight out to the water's edge and relax there. Okay. - Any docks? - There are. There are two boat slips that come with every home here. - Okay. - This is new construction. It's almost completed. The builder has some finishing touches to put on it, but all it needs is some siding put on the back, and you're good to go. Okay. All right, sounds great. I can't wait to see it. Yeah, yeah. - Wow. - Oh, how cute. I love that. I love the little front porch area. I love that front door. Oh, wow. It's so open and airy. - I love the colors. - I know. It's so neutral, and look at this kitchen. This is beautiful. Everything is new. And I love the flow, how it's all open. Yeah. It's all open. Right when you walk in the front door, you can see everything, the view of the water out there. - Yeah. - Is this a quartz counter? I think it is. I can see some stools right here. Oh, yeah, for sure. Yeah, everybody can eat and everything. Yeah. There's plenty of room there. Do you think we need a table in this room? I don't think so. I'd rather have more room for seating. A little bit bigger couch here so we can sit around. Maybe a big sectional. Think it would look a lot better in this room, and you have that great view. - Yeah, that's a beautiful view. It's really nice, the windows, the doors. And there's a huge area out there for a deck. You've got a nice big wall there for your TV. This is a great space. And this flooring is so pretty. It's so nice and neutral, and I like the way it flows throughout the entire first floor here. Right. Oh. Okay. This is the guest bedroom. Nice, but it's small, but it's a guest bedroom. - Right. - Yeah. Guest closet. And when our guests are here, they're not really in their rooms that much anyway. - Yeah, I'd hope not. - They want to be outside. I'd hope they did. We could either put bunk beds in here. Oh, great idea. Kids would love it. And then in here must be the master bedroom. Oh, wow. Oh, now this is what I'm talking about. Look how bright it is. I love the detail on the ceiling. Yeah. It looks like we could probably fit a king bed in here, and there's plenty of room to put another little sitting area. Right. Got the outside area. If we get a deck all the way across here, right... Oh, yeah. ...we could sit out there and hang out there, too. Right. - Oh, double sinks. - There you go. I like that the green color has been brought into here, and look at the detail on that shower wall. Put a nice glass door. Yeah, because you don't want to hide all of that tile work. - No. - That's so pretty. Let's go downstairs. This is the area I've been dying to see. This is beautiful. Wow. This is a fantastic entertaining space. Look at all this room. We can do all kinds of stuff. Oh, look at the bar. Love the backsplash on here, too. This is fantastic, and then look at the views. - Oh, wow. - Wow. Look how nice this is. Got your docks right here. - And I do love that firepit. - Me, too. I can see us sitting out there a lot, some Adirondack chairs making s'mores. Be really nice. The channel is great, but you know me. - I like busy. - Well, maybe you do. Need more a little action. I like the peacefulness out here. - Right. - The yard is a little small. Yeah, there's not gonna be a lot of space for the dogs. No. My other concern is just it's not finished yet, so maybe they do have plans to put a deck across the top and... That would be great. ...we're gonna have to talk to Paige and see when they're planning on completing it. I really want to check out that clubhouse and the pool. - Yeah, me, too. - Okay. Sounds good. This is fantastic, isn't it? - This is beautiful. - Yes. This pool, it's only five feet deep. Okay. It's salt water. It has a feature where you can turn it on and turn it into a lap pool and swim laps. Oh. Oh, I love it, a lot of nice shade here. So what did you think about the house? - I liked it. - Did you? - I loved that it was turnkey. - The layout was great. And I loved the bar area downstairs. - Yeah. - Really neat. There were some things unfinished. We had the siding on top. We don't want to wait too long for something to be done. Okay. That will be finished as soon as possible. Okay. And is the plan to have a double deck out there? Yeah. It would extend out from the living room and also extend out from the master suite. - That'd be great... - Right. ...just that much more entertaining space then. Right. The channel is really nice, but is there anything out there with more of an open view? Sure. We can definitely look at that, some open-water properties. - All right, sounds good. - Sounds good. Let's do it. This one is gonna be a hard one to beat, though. Oh, I know. ¶¶ ¶¶ When we get around the corner, you'll see all of the Sunfish out on the Sunfish dock. They're neat little pretty indestructible sailboats. Oh. And they're a lot of fun on a windy day like this. Today, we're renting a boat. It's a totally different perspective. The water views are fantastic. Great way to see the lake. Wow! Look at that house over there. Is that an island it's on? How would you like to live on something like that? That'd be fun. Do you think we could afford that one? No. It's just so amazing to see that places like this exist an hour outside of Columbus. This looks amazing. - Yeah. - Let's go check this out. These are the Sunfish that we use in our junior sailing camp. Every sail is a different color. When they're all out, it looks like a bunch of butterflies out on the water. - Oh! I love that. - So cool. Jim is working all the time. I'm very busy running a yoga studio. Mallory's at school spending time with her friends, so when we get to Indian Lake, it's just fantastic that we can all be together. This is called the tiller. This is how you drive it. There is just so many things to do here at Indian Lake as a family. I really love trying new experiences and adventures, and that's something that we'll be able to do here on Indian Lake. I like it. I really want a sailboat now. Yeah, maybe. Let's get you in some lessons first. We'll get you guys some lessons, too. - That'd be great. - Yeah? Jim and Angie are all about having a waterfront home with a yard which is why I want to show them the Silver Reel. This property is located in the village of Lakeview. It's on the southwest side of Indian Lake, and it has expansive views of Indian Isles. I'm loving this yard space out front. This is fantastic. This lot is actually 1.23 acres. You have an extra detached garage and a basketball court. - Oh. Well, that's an interesting feature. How many beds and bath? 4 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths, 3,215 square feet. Oh, wow. The list price on this house is $750,000. Top end. And keep in mind, once you walk in there, you'll see that it does need a little bit of updating. - Okay. - But once you see the view, you'll understand why it's priced the way it is. Any of the upgrades that we want to do is gonna take some time. Go check it out and let me know what you think. Great. Thanks. What do you think about the front? It's not exactly what I was hoping for, the look of it. - It's not your style, is it? - No. - You can tell it's older. - Yeah. - Oh. Yeah. - Look at this wall. That's interesting to walk right into the wall there. This is nice. Oh, look through there. Wow. Oh, my gosh. It's not a terribly great first impression, but when you come around the corner... No, when you walk around the corner, it's beautiful. - ...this is fantastic. - Look at those views. - Oh. - These windows are huge. I love this open concept. Just the whole layout, and you see everything. How about that fireplace? Oh, that's beautiful, very simple, but it looks really nice. - Look at the view out here. - Wow. And I absolutely love this brick floor... This is really neat. ...and the way it goes up the wall there, and there's another fireplace. What a cozy little room this is... Sectional, the TV, a fireplace, a little eating area. I can see me really hanging out in here. Okay, this is an interesting kitchen, not terrible. It matches everything. Yeah, nice and neutral. The countertops are very clean, well-maintained. It's a little boring. I would like to replace these. - Some granite probably. - Yeah. Stainless steel would be nice to help kind of break up all of the white color in here, too. That's gonna just cost more. Just something to think about. See what's down here. Oh, wow, nice, bright hallway, and this must be the guest bath. Needs a little updating. The faucet is a little outdated. I would like to redo that and maybe the sink, and we could always replace the showerhead for a new, more modern one. - Great. - How about these floors? You could put some rugs down to hide that, and they're not terrible. - Oh. - Maybe the guest bedroom? - Another bedroom. - This is nice. Really nice, it's big, too, spacious. Yeah. - It's got a queen bed. - Right. Could even fit a king in here if we wanted to. - And look at the windows. - I love those shutters. The windows are really nice again. They're so charming. And we get to see all the light coming in here. Right. And this maybe is the master bedroom. Wow. - That is just spectacular. - Beautiful. What a great size this room is. We could even turn the bed and put it on this wall... We could. ...so we could always be looking out that direction. That's a great idea. The floors carried on all the way in here. Yeah, I like that a lot. And how great to just be able to walk right outside the patio. Really nice. Maybe instead of a dining room table, we could put chaise lounges. - Maybe a hot tub. - That's a good idea. - And then the bathroom. - Oh. - Oh, okay. - Look at this tile. Ugh. But it's got two different sinks. How about the shower? Now that looks a little small. It's a little tight. Uh-oh. Maybe you can start taking baths. Really small. Not crazy about the lights, the sink and the faucet. They're pretty all outdated. It's a lot of work in here. But this is absolutely spectacular. These views, wow. Look at this. Imagine waking up to this every morning. Look at these trees back here, all the shade. And tons of yard space. This is just beautiful, completely makes up for whatever I thought about the front of the house. Oh, for sure. And then the dock out there, there's just so many different areas that you can sit and enjoy different parts of the lake. The only thing that scares me is that, it being $750,000, that really limits us, and with the kitchen, the master bath, and the guest bath all needing remodeled, that's definitely something to think about. And you're gonna want a fence for these dogs. Right. Yeah. We're not gonna be able to do any of that anytime soon... Right. ...and we're gonna have to just figure out if we are okay with that, or we want to keep looking for something else. Right. ¶¶ I mean, it looks like you can boat ride up to here, and there's the donut shop. Donut shop, oh, we've got to hit up that. Oh, how fun would that be? So if we choose that brand-new house, we just have to make sure that we're both okay with the location. It was really nice, had the two docks. I like the seclusion of it and that it's on a canal. I was looking for a little more action, something we can maybe watch boats go by, jet skis. It had a lot of great features. I really like that clubhouse. Yeah, that was nice, and the house was turnkey-ready. We could walk right in and just start enjoying it. The colors were great. The basement was awesome. And then the Cranberry Bay house was on a busy road, but it was right on the bay, could look out and see all the homes and boats and I'm sure some jet skis. Well, what'd you think about the inside? The color scheme was a little darker maybe than what we want. It was dark. But the kitchen was fantastic and that bonus room upstairs that we could turn into a game room and maybe an office for you. Yeah, I think there was plenty of room up there. The yard was very small, and the dogs, that might be hard for them, and just when we're entertaining, it might be hard to have a lot of space out there to hold all of our guests. Yeah. If we wanted the largest yard, we're gonna have to go with the white house. Walking in and being able to have the kitchen look right over the living room and out to the water was really nice. It ended up having two separate living spaces. I think it really comes down to, how much do we want to spend? It's $750,000, and there were definitely some updates we'd want to make, and at that price point, that's not something we're gonna be able to do. But the lot itself, there's so much we can do with that. Right. I'm just so excited that we're finally here and finally doing it, and I just can't wait to get up here and spend quality time together. I think we'll have a lot of good times up here. ¶¶ We have been having so much fun making memories with Mallory at Indian Lake. I'm hoping that we can maybe take sailing lessons... Yeah. ...when we move up here. - For sure. - At the Indian Lake Yacht Club? - Yeah, that would be great. - That's a great place. Tell me what you guys are thinking. Are you ready to put an offer in on one of those houses? - I think we are. - Which one is it? - Silver Reel. - Silver Reel. - Fantastic. I love that. - I know. I think it's a great fit for you guys. Like, that outside area, we just could not pass that up. Beautiful. And the large lot, it's just... - It's so nice. - Yeah. It'll be fantastic, and we can live with the outdated kitchen and the outdated baths for a while. It's all functional. The listing price is $750,000. What are you thinking? It's really stretching us a little bit. We'd like to come in a little bit lower. Can we start at, like, $725,000? Sure. We can try that, see what they come back with, and we'll go from there. In the meantime, I can go write up that offer, and we'll see what happens. - Sounds great. - All right. ¶¶ How are you doing, Jim? You catching anything? Nothing yet. We want dinner. We're getting hungry. We decided to go with the Silver Reel house. The list price was $750,000. We offered $725,000, but they countered back with $750,000 firm. We didn't want to lose out on this house, so we agreed to $750,000. Both of our dogs absolutely love this property. There is so much room for them to run around. We don't have a fence yet, but they seem to mind us pretty well and stay close by. Yeah, they do a great job. Can I play with you guys? - Sure if you want. - All right. - Who's my partner? - You better be mine. Mallory is kicking my butt. We have been so busy enjoying all kinds of fun things here at Indian Lake. I'm so happy to come back to this house after work. All my stress just goes right away. Play on Mallory's side here. All right. - Here we go. - Be nice. We're spending a lot more time together as a family. Since Mallory's gonna be a senior, we're really treasuring every moment that we get and just relaxing. It's great.
