Back off! Go! Georg, get back! Michael fucked up. He had no cover. - Who's in the car? COUNTERPARTS I don't know, but we won't push him. Get back, Georg! Georg! Georg, go away! Go away, man! He's armed. What are you doing there? Go away! Georg, he's gonna kill us both! Put the gun away! I'm going to puke! What are you looking at? Shit! Put the gun down. I got him, I got him! - Are you OK, Georg? Come on, Micha, let him go! Wanker! - Let him go! You can't mess with guys like us! Right, Georg? You're nuts! - I got him, so what? You pissed your pants, big guy. What's that all about? I took a risk. Shit! I'm the only one here who takes risks. He got a real gun, wow! - Yeah, come on. Stupid faggot! - You can't act on your own. If he tells Hinreich, I won't get my promotion. Yeah, come on. Why did you get off work so early? I spent the whole day in the office. Doing paperwork. You're home early, too. You call this early? Shall I tell you about my dream? - Sure. In my dream we were kissing. - Kissing? Like we did when we were 18? Do you want me to show you? - Go ahead. Just briefly, OK? - OK. How much longer is your dream? Who is that? - Must be the kids. Tuck your shirt in. Hello! You've been smoking again! Your Mum quit smoking years ago. - Lf you say so. Hey, big boy, you OK? - Your hair is so short now! But you look great! I bought some Christmas things for you. No, thank you. - Even jelly! No, really... - Just tell me. Let's go! - Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. I'm quitting law school. Can we talk about this some other time? I don't want to ruin this evening for your Mum. Understood? - Yes. What took you so long? - The coffee machine was still on. We'll have roast venison, I think. Lukas, did you bring the? OK, good. And chocolate pudding. Will there be chocolate pudding? - For sure. So what do you think? - Delicious! Would you please hand that on to Georg? - And one for Lukas? I'm always happy when you're here. Georg? How are you doing professionally? - Well, you know me. I'm striving for consistency. What about you, Anne? Are you striving for consistency, too? - Georg is doing fine. It just takes him a bit longer. - Longer is a flexible term. Paying off the loan for your house has taken a bit longer, too. You should have listened to me a bit longer. But Georg is the expert on real estate in the family. So you'll need me a bit longer, too. So much about the meaning of longer. - I'll wrap the left-overs for you. Georg, would you give me a hand? - I'll have a trainee teacher soon. I'm looking forward to it. - Nice. Would you put that in the kitchen? - Yes, sure. That's great, I thought they were only for grammar schools. No, at elementary schools, too. I'm really looking forward to it. The pen doesn't work. - Oh... I'll get you another one. You could write a bigger check. Or quit it altogether. Shall I quit it altogether, Anne? - No. Yes! - Stop it, Marie! That's brilliant, Anne! This one works. Here's to our Wednesdays! - Here's to us! Georg. - Hans-Josef. Look at this, Anne. You don't have to give me presents. - Yes, but... ...I bought this a while ago, and now it doesn't fit me. I gained so much weight. Try it on, will you? Anne... Dad means no harm, you know that. - Sure. Come on. We'll go back in. Where are the kids? Why didn't you wake me? They are gone. - Why? Great! Now I didn't even say goodbye. It has to be in the bank tomorrow. - I know. You're happy that I'm disappointed. - Come on... You think that's great! I can see that you're happy! Anne, please stop screaming! - I'm trying to explain something to you. Anne, please. - Please, Anne, please. It ain't no drama. - Sure it's no drama. I'm just trying... Always that stupid phrase: "It ain't no drama. " I hate it, when you lock the door. Sorry. I'm sorry. About before. Hello. - Good morning. Hey! Don't touch! Don't punch! Don't... That's right, isn't it? Come with me. Robert, what's wrong? Whose pen is it? - Mine. So we'll return it to Louisa. Robert, guys like you are much stronger than girls like us, right? Yes. - Yes, indeed. It's stupid. Anne, it's Dad. You said you were going to call today. I'll call Lukas now. He'll be at home. Hello? Hello, my girl. Why aren't you home? I can't reach Lukas, either. Shit! Out of the way! Hey, guys. You have to tell us about the operation. Shut up and look at the great dishwasher that Georg brought. We know why you'd prefer to keep quiet. You want to talk? I have no problem with it. We could talk about the speed of this machine. But it was fucking great! - It was indeed. Stop talking about it. What's that? Are we having a tea party or what? Don't be shy. - Hello, boss. Hello. Georg, please come and see me soon. Does the boss know already, who's going to be boss? Nobody's going to be boss, because I'm the boss. And furthermore you know... ...you know that promotions will be announced at our Christmas party, like every year. Does everybody have one now? - Yes. Georg won't be promoted, right? He is not interested. He just wants to help. What's wrong with that? "It's not people, but circumstances that are bad. " I only said that once. - I'd better leave you to it then. What was that all about, Ahmed? Georg is simply a sensitive person. Women go for that. Isn't that so, Denise? You want a guy like that, right? A sensitive, slim... What else were you looking for? Fuck off! - A sporty guy who likes to cuddle! Read my horoscope! Come on! No, no! It's one more flight. Really? - Yes. I haven't been here for a while. That's a bit embarrassing, right? A tiny bit. Watch out for the corners. Alright. Hello. - Hello. There it is. - Yes, there it is. I'd rather have a dog than a dishwasher. A dog? That would suit you well. Happy couples make me puke. I'm not always happy. Well, me neither. That's normal. You have good reasons to be happy at the moment, right? And I'm grateful to you, yes. I didn't mean it that way. - So, how did you mean it? What are you talking about? - Oh, nothing. What do you mean, nothing? What's that supposed to mean? Didn't he tell you? You talk about irrelevant bullshit, but not about important issues. Because it's not important. What do you mean, it's not important? It was a police operation. - A police operation? He saved my arse, I mean, my life. Your arse, your life? Oh, look at you! You're a hero! OK. Thank you, Micha. Bye! - Bye! She's just worried. - No problem. You'll talk to the boss about? I will. - OK. Are you OK? What's wrong, Anne? What did I do wrong this time? Talk to me, Anne, please. Anne, Anne, Anne... Anne, please! I thought we would have a nice evening, for a change. But we can still have a nice evening. - Yes, sure. With your dumb wife who you can't talk to in a normal way. Do you realize that you make me look like an idiot with your secretive manner. Anne, look at me. - No! Look at me. - I don't want to! I didn't want you to worry about me. You wanted to lie to me. Admit it! You did, you wanted to lie to me! Admit it! Don't do this to me! Go away! I just want to help you, Anne! - I don't want your fucking help! Your stupid, fucking help! - Come on, Anne! Stop it! Help yourself! Anne, don't! It ain't no drama, OK? It ain't no drama... Are you bleeding? Yes, you're bleeding. I'm sorry, Anne. I didn't mean it. Congratulations! Take a seat. - I have to tell you something. Sure you do, after such a great operation. Here, Piazza San Marco in Venice. Doves everywhere. You want some? - No. It's not about me... I wanted to recommend Michael to you. You can't be serious. Let me phrase it this way: The German forest, OK? Big old oak trees, with strong trunks. The old ones provide shelter for the young ones. And you are an oak tree, Georg. And that's why I want to promote you. But Michael is good too. - Well... Maybe even an oak tree like you... ...has to think it over for a few days. Talk to your wife about it. Women like that kind of thing. - Alright. Listen... Hinreich just offered the bloody promotion to me. To you? He thinks I'm a weakling or what? - No, I... I told him that I consider you the better choice. Really, that's what you told him? Thank you. What's that, Dad? That was a boy, who freaked out during a breath test. You don't drink and drive, do you? Can you pass me the rolls, please? - Sure, here you are. Thank you. - Take the half first. And how are things with you, Marie? - I have to study. You'll have fun, once you start your traineeship. Seriously, for me it was like that. - Well, if you say so. The mozzarella tastes like cardboard. Have you found a new tutor yet? Mum, can we talk about a different subject for a change? Sorry, but we invest a lot of money to put you through college. It's Granddad who's paying for it. It's your family who's paying for it. I could do without it. - Mum, you're talking like Granddad. Can't you be more careful? - I'm sorry. Don't rub it in! You have to dab it. You're so clumsy, everything's wet now. - Anne, It ain't no drama. I said, don't rub it in, dab it! I told you to stop! - Anne, please! It's everywhere. - Stop it, please. Where are you going? - Mum... You're leaving? But you're not even finished! That's a rather short advent breakfast. - Relax, Mum. We'll see each other on Wednesday. - Mum, we're not going there any more. What? Mum, It ain't no drama. Why did you spill the coffee? - I didn't do it on purpose. Next time tell them straight away that they should leave. Let's be friends again, OK? Where are you going? - To see some friends. Are you busy? - Do you have too much free time now? No, the same as in my student days. So you really want to quit? So what are you going to do now? I'll train to become a cook. Or a joiner. All you've ever cooked is canned ravioli. Could you stop that, please? I'm going to tell Mum now. - Hey, Lukas! Don't, I'll tell her. - Are you sure? Yes. - Really? Why shouldn't I be sure? I can explain it better than you. No trouble. It's nice that you still bring your wife flowers. Yes? Love has to be taken care of. - I'd like to have someone to care for. How did you meet? - In a stairwell. I went to see a friend in the building that her parents lived in. Love at first sight? Yes, that's it. Is it still good? - At some stage you count your blessings. No, Georg. They are for your wife. I can buy her new ones tomorrow. Anne, don't get excited. Lukas has... ...Lukas wants to start something new. Anne, don't get excited. Lukas wants something different. Shit! Hello! I need only think of you and you arrive. Yes, I'm here. Too early, am I? No! I'm happy that you're here. It's very important that you're here. I thought we should have a nice evening. Talk a little, or... - Tonight? Why? Cheers! - Cheers! Well... How was your day? - Good. I get along really well with Sabrina. That's great. Who is Sabrina? - My friend. From school. You even saw her a little while ago. You have a memory like a sieve. Well... I don't know. Maybe I'll meet her again some day. What's wrong? Nothing, I just wanted to have a good time with you. We're drinking champagne for no reason, or what? Something's wrong here. What do you think is wrong, Anne? What do you want to talk about? - What do you think is wrong? Anne? Anne... Sorry. I'm sorry, Anne. Anne, why are you doing this? Anne! - My husband has secrets. Calm down. - I don't want to calm down, and I don't have to calm down. Let me go, please! I just want you to have a nice evening. - Please let me go. I don't want a nice evening with you. I forgot, you're a hero now. Tell them what it's like at home. Sorry. You're such an arsehole! They want to promote me. - What? I'm getting a promotion. Why? Do you want to leave me? May I? Do you still love me? - Yes. Is that OK for you? It's not because I don't love you. Maybe we could talk to somebody. No, I... I can handle this. I'll deal with it. That was the last time, OK? And after your promotion... ...you'll focus on your career, and I'll sit at home, waiting for you? I don't have to accept the promotion. - Yes you do. Then we can give the kids money, for a change. Lukas needs another three or four years at university. You know, Lukas... It may not mean that much to him. - You will do it. I can't wait to see my father's face, when we tell him. Dad! Have you stopped dieting? Here. No cream and just a drop of milk. Well... Shall I help you? - No, thank you. I've thought about this year's Christmas presents. Your Mum always buys these tacky things. - That's true. I hope you didn't inherit that quality from her. What's the matter, darling? - I can't keep my mind off Georg. Can't keep your mind off him? - He's being promoted. He's worth thinking of now, right? The fact that he's overtaken you comes as a real surprise. But after all, if you will have one child after the next... A hot cup of coffee, please. - Certainly. Could you explain it to Michael? - Tell Michael? I might as well tell everybody. What about our Christmas party? You're a strange guy. Congratulations! - Thank you. Give my regards to your wife. - Yes. I'll tell her, thank you. There's nothing to celebrate. Did you hear that? Don't be so modest, Georg! It's not like you get promoted every day. What a surprise! - Oh yes! Congratulations! What's going to happen now? Are you going to work with this... What's his name, darling? - Who? We'll wait and see. - What's the name of this guy? We'll remember, when we've stopped thinking about it. OK. It doesn't matter, anyway. Well... I spent a long time deciding... ...what would be an appropriate present. And I've thought a lot about your loan. But now you're more independent. Well, to cut a long story short, I decided to give you a symbolic gift. And now I just hope that it means as much to you as it does to me. Come here and try it on. Thank you. - You're welcome. Now that we're having such a nice party, I would like to tell you... ...something special. I'm happy that our lives are in sync and so harmonious. Now that Georg has been promoted, a lot will change for me too. Please come to the point. I'm fostering a boy, who has problems at home. I'm promoting myself, in a moral sense, Where did you find this boy? - In school. What problems does he have? - Can't you just be happy for me? I've got it! Von Soerenmark, that's his name! I'm going to introduce the boy to you. I told you! You remember, when you stop thinking about it. His name is Robert. I'll need your support for this. Did you see my father's happy face, when I told him about Robert. I don't understand, what this is all about. It's so typical of him. He can't admit to his feelings. It's so obvious if you know him. Anne, what is all this nonsense about the child? You begrudge it me because of your stupid career. But Dad was happy. I know that for certain. I just don't understand, what you have in mind. Helping people, instead of sending them to jail. Say that Dad was happy! - Anne, please! Say it! - Anne, stop that! Say that he was happy! He was happy! I just want you all to be a bit proud of me too. Anne... Nobody wishes you ill. - But nobody helps me, either! Why don't you fight back? I don't understand! Hit me! Why are you like that? I want you to fight back! Why don't you do it? Hello, Marie. Did you hear that Lukas wants to become a cook? What do you mean, he should do it? That's rubbish! No, it's just... No, wait... You know... I've been thinking that it would be a good idea, if you told Mum. No, Mum likes talking to you best. It's the truth! Come on... Marie, please! Oh no, not that stuff, I hate it! - "The Axe Effect, the Axe Effect!" Open the window! - He'll never learn! What are you doing tonight? - Not much. What are you doing? - I'll go to Top Ten. Didn't you go there last week? - Yeah, but I came too late. Didn't get in. Shall we go out for a drink tonight? We need to talk. Not going to your in-laws tonight? - No, I would like to chat to you. About what we discussed recently. Yes, sure. - OK? Yeah. Right now? - Yes. Why don't we do something together? - At your place? You'd like that, wouldn't you? We'll go to Georg's house then. We've never been there before. No... that's not possible, not today. Why not today? - Anne will be asleep already. Come on, Georg! - Who wears the trousers? Exactly! You have to be really quiet. Otherwise it's not happening at all. You have to be quiet! Oh shit! Cheers! - Quiet! You want us to clink glasses quietly? Clink quietly! You don't understand a thing, when you're chewing these things. Therefore you have to whisper louder! Listen, that was the last time. Do it again and the party's over. Ok? Hello. What's happening here? I hope we're not disturbing you. - No, not at all. We could go somewhere else. - No, it's fine. It's nice that you're here! You don't bring home friends very often. Do you have a reason to celebrate? - Always. You need glasses, right? Here... there... We need a bowl for that. Looks better. Can you put them in? - Yes, sure. I'm Anne. And who are you? Ahmed. - Ahmed... hello. Nice flat. - Thanks, and you are? I'm Oliver. - Oliver, hello, pleased to meet you. Cheers! - It's nice that you're here. I'll put on some music. May I have this dance? We'll drink to Georg now, the best buddy in the police force... ...to whom I owe so much. Give him yours, go on! - To Georg! Cheers, Georg! To your well-deserved promotion! You never know, maybe it's not going to happen... What do you mean? That's not possible. You're joking, right? - No, I don't know... It's not official yet. I don't know about it officially. We'll drink to Superintendent Georg Hoffmann now! Here's to Superintendent Georg Hoffmann! Pour me another drink. And to Anne. To Anne! Cheers! - The wife of our new boss! You're very charming, Michael. 1600 euros after tax The German Police is best! 1600 euros after tax The German Police is best! Bedroom, bedroom... Conga line! Conga line. ...this boy from school, who has behavioural problems. I have maternal feelings towards him. What? - I care for a boy. You care for him? With your pretty hands? Exactly. You're making fun of me. Now you'll get a promotion, too! Guys, I'm sorry, it's three o'clock now. Our neighbours will get annoyed. I don't give a shit! That boring, boring face of yours, all night long! A face like that all the time! Well, at least you had fun. Yes, I did. I had to take care of your friends, didn't I? Come here. - Anne, please... If I wasn't so drunk, I would beat you to death. Anne... - It won't work. Help me, come on... What's wrong, Anne? See, it works! You bad-mouthed me, right? - How can you say such a thing? You told Hinreich that I pissed my pants. That's so selfish of you! Stay here for now. We'll go in alone first. I don't want this! - You have everything, the kids, Anne... This should have been my position! - Yes, I know... I'm sorry, but what should I do? Shall I comfort you? Stay here. Hello? Hello, this is the police. We're coming in now. Good morning. My name's Hoffmann, central precinct. This is Gleiwitz. - Good morning. Why didn't you open when we rung? Look at me. Did you beat your wife? No? Let me smell your breath. Feel free to answer. Hello? Look at me. Cutting onions always makes me cry. My mother says, if you cry when you cut onions, you shouldn't marry. But I married anyway. So, I put some in now... I'm cooking something tasty. Because I'm cooking for my husband. Georg is his name. You don't know him yet but you will soon. Say "Georg. " Georg. - Yes, that's it. He's a policeman. It's a dangerous job. Do you know what you want to be? You can help me kneed these for the moment. Put your hands in. It's fun. I've got two children. They're both at university. My daughter's going to teach, like me. Stop it! Hello. Everything OK? - Yes. It's cold outside. Come along. - Where to? The boy has fallen asleep in front of the TV. Who is that? - Robert. Who is Robert? My little foster child. You knew that. Don't pretend. Mum. - Yes. Psst! I thought you gave him extra tuition. - No. What do his parents think? - They should be glad I'm doing so much. Which of your things do you still want? I have to put the rest in the cellar. Because Robert doesn't want a girl's room. Worry about your own son instead. - Why? He quit university three weeks ago. What? You mean... You've all known for some time? - No one dares speak to you. Not even Dad? He might have said something. Yes, Michael? It's Anne here. No, where is Georg? I've cooked for him. Where's he gone? And he didn't say where he was going? No, I'm worried. And his mobile is turned off, too. You're funny. I cooked something good. No. Nonsense. You're pretty fast, aren't you. Come along. Can I have one too? Cheers. - Cheers. OK. Show me. You've got to put money in here. I think I've got none left. Shit. Then we can only drink one beer. - No, I'm out of coins. I'll have to go to the front. Shall I go? Tell me something. Do people still have sex if they've been married long? Sometimes. And does it change? Yes. It does. I can't. Well, do something. What should I do? You should do something. You think this is fun for me? Do something! At least look at me. Georg, what's going on? Come on, do something! - Stop. Stop it! Stop it! You're not going away? Take your stuff! You're both losers! Repulsive losers. Get out of here! Bye. Good evening. Its embarrassing how good your dinner tastes It tastes shit. You're so sick, Georg. You're always lying. I didn't lie. It was a lie not to tell me that Lukas has ruined his life. Well, you know... I just didn't want you to be unhappy. You've turned Lukas and Marie against me. Anne, we all love you. - Bullshit! All of us empathise with you. It's all normal. Anne. Let's call our kids. OK? Lukas and Marie should come here. Get your hands off. I said get your hands off! You just want to humiliate me in front of them. What's the matter? Georg? Hello, Hoffmann speaking. Send a taxi to 73 Linden Street please. To Georg Hoffmann's. Yes. Thanks. We'll have a family member collect you. - There's no need. No, I insist. I won't let you go in that state. Would you like to stay with me? No, no. I know where I'll go. Dad, we can't take it anymore. Georg! Don't worry, I didn't come to hurt you. Come in. Well? - Well... Want something to drink? If it's not inconvenient. - Course not. Whisky's all I got. - Fine. No ice. Can I have a look around? - Course. Nice couch. Does it fold out? No. You can fold out ours, but we never do. - Oh, right. That's practical. I've never slept with Anne in the living room. Did she hit you while you did it? Georg! I'm not a pervert you know. 9l11. Bedroom. Yeah. You know. Did you do it here too? It was only once, Georg. Really. That's all. She'd have told me if I hadn't seen it. We talk a lot, you know. She goes a bit mental sometimes. But not always. It's normal if you've been married long. Can I show you something? It's been a bit out of control for the last couple of years. No, have a look! No, I don't want to. I haven't seen the kitchen yet. Right. It's not always as hard as that. That was more an exception. It's not a sex game, right? I make mistakes too. Course. It's terrible for the children. - Yes. Yes. Do you think I'm weak now? I'll be boss soon. Georg... How should I know? I pissed my pants recently, too. It happens. I thought, if I'm done for, well, that's it. That you were done for? You tried to save me. - I wasn't sure my gun was loaded. It's crazy, isn't it? I might have died. You too. Are you angry with me? Do you want to leave me? Wait. We have to be careful. Please. Take that off quick. You think it'll be OK? Did I hurt you? - No. I mean, this tree is not damaged rubbish from the woods. Let me carry it. He felled it himself. - I've got it, thanks. It's a tree fit for the Interior Minister. Over here, don't you think? For the time being. So. Unbelievable. To Georg. - Thanks Cheers. - Cheers. I'm sure the Youth Welfare Office will let us keep the boy. You could just as well donate to Amnesty now that your husband's earning. We prefer to invest in taking nothing from you. We're starting over again. Starting over? It's a bit late for that. - Late? What do you mean? And if it's late, shouldn't you be going home? That was your last tree. We could go on holiday again. - Yes. To the Maldives. And go diving. Yes. - Or... ...to Sicily. We've had little time for each other. Was it all my fault? - No, no. We were always looking after other people. Hey, stop it. - Come here. It won't look good if I take a break now. What's up? Lt'd be better if you kept away today. You're worried about me? - Do me the favour. Sorry. What's up? Am I riding with you or what? Hey, you there. Come over here. What's going on? Georg, just go home, OK? Where did Michael go on his own? Maybe to see your wife. I don't want to. Don't make things harder. Right, look at this. Have a good look at this. No, over here. No way. - Georg, I'm sorry, but it's no big deal. Hey, say, you'll wear the new one, right? Try it on with the tie. - When I'm finished. Good. Know what I was thinking? We could visit Sabrina together. Yes, we could. We should socialise more. I hope the kids will come for Christmas. - They'll come. It'll be nice. Robert will come too. You have fun. Don't be back too late. You don't need Robert, a promotion, or anything. That's not important. I know. Then everything's OK. And let's not have any more trouble, OK? - Yes. And just be kind to each other. I do want to be really happy, you know? Hello there. Where are the children? And that Robert? - They're hiding. Hello, Chief Superintendent. I'm not Chief Superintendent. I didn't believe it anyway. It's OK this way too. - Of course. It's great. Same as ever. You're still a loser, and I make up stories. Pull yourself together. - There's no reason to. There is. Me. You know what my parents will think. So fucking what? Let's not think about it. - I think what I want! Just stop it. - You shut your mouth. You loser. No one needs you. You're needed by no one. Hit me again and I'll have you prosecuted. You stupid cow. Let me go!
