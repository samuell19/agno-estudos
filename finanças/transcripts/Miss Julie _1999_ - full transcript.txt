A PAIR OF WHITE SILK STOCKINGS AND A PINK DRESS. AND I HID-- FILTHY AND STINKING-- UNDERNEATH THE THISTLES AND THE ROTTING EARTH. AND I WATCHED THE GIRL... WALK AMONG THE ROSES...

YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE ME TO COMMUNION THIS MORNIN'. MMM. WHAT'S THE SERMON TODAY ? [ Dishes Clattering ] JOHN THE BAPTIST HAVIN' HIS HEAD CUT OFF, I SUSPECT. IT SHOULD BE SUITABLY BRIEF. WHAT WERE YOU DOING ALL NIGHT ? YOU NEVER CAME TO BED. I WAS TALKING. TALKING TO-- MISS JULIE. [ Scoffs ] THAT ONE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S PROPER. WERE YOU DRINKING WITH HER AS WELL ? LOOK AT ME. WERE YOU DRINKING WITH HER ? YES. OH, THAT POOR GIRL. YOU DIDN'T-- [ Whispering ] WELL, SHAME ON YOU. WHAT AN EVIL THING TO DO ! I DON'T WANT TO STAY IN THIS HOUSE ANY LONGER IF YOU CAN'T RESPECT YOUR BETTERS. WHY SHOULD YOU RESPECT THEM ? YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T RESPECTABLE, WOULD YOU ? TAKE COMFORT IN THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NO BETTER THAN WE ARE. IF THEY AREN'T ANY BETTER THAN US, THEN WHAT IS THE POINT IN US STRIVING TO BETTER OURSELVES ? DID YOU THINK OF THE COUNT ? DID YOU ? OF THE SORROW THAT MAN'S HAD ? I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE ANY LONGER. [ Bottles Rattling ] IF IT HAD BEEN CLARA OR ONE OF THE KITCHEN GIRLS, THEN I'D BE JEALOUS. BUT... NOT OF HER. TO GIVE HERSELF TO YOU ? THE FOOTMAN ? IF IT HAD BEEN THAT LAWYER OR SOMEONE BETTER-- I WON'T STAY. I WON'T STAY HERE ANY LONGER. WHERE WOULD YOU GO ? WHERE WOULD WE GO ? I CAN'T GET A POSITION LIKE THIS ONCE I'M MARRIED. BUT YOU CAN GET A JOB AS A PORTER OR A CARETAKER-- OR A CIVIL SERVANT. THE CIVIL SERVICE PAY IS BAD, BUT AT LEAST THERE'S A PENSION FOR THEIR WIFE AND CHILDREN. I'VE NO INTENTION OF DYING FOR MY WIFE AND CHILDREN. NOT YET ! I'VE GOT MORE AMBITIONS THAN THAT. I KNOW ABOUT YOUR AMBITIONS. OH, YES. WHAT ABOUT YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES ? DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT RESPONSIBILITIES ! [ Footsteps Overhead ] WHO'S THAT WALKING AROUND UP THERE ? [ Footsteps Continue ] IT'S CLARA. IT COULDN'T BE THE COUNT, COULD IT ? NO, THE COUNT WOULD HAVE RUNG. [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Footsteps Departing ] YOU GO AND GET READY FOR CHURCH. COME ON. GO ON, GO ON. OFF YOU GO. [ Footsteps Approaching ] [ Whispering ] SHH. CHRISTINE'S AWAKE. DOES SHE SUSPECT ANYTHING ? NO. DID YOU GET THE MONEY ? YES. ENOUGH ? [ Suitcase Thuds ] MISS JULIE ? ENOUGH TO BEGIN WITH. DO YOU WANT TO COUNT IT ? ARE YOU STILL COMING WITH ME ? YES. YES ! [ Panting ] NOW WE-- WE'LL LEAVE BY THE FRONT DOOR. [ Bird Chirping ] ALL RIGHT ? GOOD MORNING, SWEETHEART. GOOD MORNING. THE SUN IS RISING. [ Chirping Continues ] CHASING THE DEMONS AWAY. YES, THE DEMONS WERE CERTAINLY OUT LAST NIGHT. COME HERE, SWEETHEART. NOW, I'VE BEEN THINKING. WE CAN'T GO BY THE BACK DOORS, SO WE'LL GO THROUGH THE FRONT. THAT WAY NO ONE WILL SUSPECT ANYTHING. I'LL PLAY THE FOOTMAN. PRETEND TO BE A FOOTMAN. LAST TIME. [ Whispering ] MISS JULIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? MISS JULIE ! MISS JULIE, WE CAN'T TAKE THE BIRD. IF WE TAKE THE BIRD, WE DRAW ATTENTION TO OURSELVES. IF WE DRAW ATTENTION TO OURSELVES, WE GET CAUGHT. [ Bird Screeching ] LEAVE THE BIRD ! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT HER. MISS JULIE, WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. SHE'S MY ONE MEMORY FROM THIS HOUSE ! SHH ! [ Wings Fluttering ] COME AND HELP ME WITH HER. [ Sighs ] ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LET ME IN. LET ME-- [ Chirping ] [ Chirping Continues ] [ Gasps, Screams ] [ Cleaver Thuds ] [ Whimpering ] [ Crying Softly ] YOU SHOULD HAVE LEARNED HOW TO SLAUGHTER PROPERLY. [ Crying Continues ] SLAUGHTER ME TOO. SLAUGHTER ME TOO. I CURSE THE MOMENT I SET EYES ON YOU. I CURSE THE MOMENT I WAS CONCEIVED IN MY MOTHER'S WOMB. I DESPISE YOU. I HATE YOU. YOU THINK I CAN'T STAND THE SIGHT OF BLOOD ? [ Sobbing ] YOU THINK I'M WEAK ? I'D LOVE TO SEE YOUR BLOOD AND BRAINS ON THIS CHOPPING BLOCK ! I'D LOVE TO SEE THE WHOLE OF YOUR SEX SWIMMING IN A LAKE OF BLOOD ! I'D DRINK FROM YOUR SKULL, WASH MY FEET IN YOUR RIB CAGE, DEVOUR YOUR HEART IN ONE MOUTHFUL ! YOU THINK I'M WEAK ? YOU THINK I LOVE YOU BECAUSE MY WOMB DESIRED YOUR SEED ? YOU THINK I WANT TO CARRY YOUR OFFSPRING UNDER MY HEART... AND NOURISH IT WITH MY BLOOD ? BEAR YOUR CHILD AND TAKE YOUR NAME ? I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD YOUR SURNAME ! I SUPPOSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT ONE. I'D BECOME "LADY FOOTMAN" OR "MADAM SHITHOUSE" ! YOU DOG WHO WEARS MY COLLAR ! YOU LABORER'S SON WHO WEARS MY COAT OF ARMS ON YOUR BUTTONS ! AM I TO SHARE YOU WITH MY COOK ? AM I TO BE THE RIVAL OF THE KITCHEN SLUT ? YOU-- YOU THINK I'M A COWARD AND WANT TO ESCAPE ? I'M STAYING ! I'M STAYING ! [ Clattering ] LET THE CLOUDS BURST ! MY FATHER WILL COME HOME. HE'LL FIND HIS DESK BROKEN INTO, THE MONEY GONE. HE'LL SEND FOR THE POLICE. I'LL TELL HIM EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING. AND IT WILL KILL MY FATHER, AND THAT WILL BE THE END FOR ALL OF US. AND THE COUNT'S LONG LINE WILL HAVE COME TO AN END. BUT THE FOOTMAN'S LINE WILL CONTINUE IN AN ORPHANAGE... AND WITH LAURELS IN THE GUTTER AND END UP IN PRISON ! [ Gasping ] [ Panting ] YOU BASTARD. [ Sobbing ] [ Sobbing Continues ] AND WHERE WOULD YOU BOTH BE GOING DRESSED LIKE THAT ? OH, HELP ME, CHRISTINE. SAVE ME. SAVE ME FROM THIS MAN. YOU-- YOU DON'T TRUST THIS BASTARD. LISTEN. LISTEN. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. NO, I WON'T. NO, I DON'T. THE KITCHEN SLUT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING. TO CHURCH, I HOPE. YOU BETTER SHAVE. PLEASE. [ Sobbing Continues ] CHRISTINE. TRY-- TRY TO UNDERSTAND. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW. BUT IF YOU'RE THINKING OF TRICKING HIM INTO RUNNING AWAY, I'LL SOON PUT A STOP TO IT. [ Breathing Heavily ] WHAT IF ALL THREE OF US WERE TO GO ABROAD TOGETHER... TO SWITZERLAND ? I'VE GOT MONEY, YOU SEE. PLEASE SAY YES, CHRISTINE. PLEASE SAY YES. WE'LL SET UP A HOTEL TOGETHER, AND YOU COULD BE IN CHARGE OF THE KITCHENS. WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD ? PLEASE SAY YES. [ Crying Softly ] YOU'VE NEVER TRAVELED, CHRISTINE. YOU SHOULD GET OUT AND SEE THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT FUN IT IS TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN. THERE'S NEW PEOPLE ALL THE TIME AND NEW COUNTRIES. AND WHEN WE GET TO HAMBURG, WE'LL VISIT THE ZOO-- YOU'LL LIKE THAT-- AND THE THEATER AND THE OPERA. WHEN WE GET TO MUNICH, WE'LL VISIT ALL THE MUSEUMS. THE GREAT PAINTERS ARE THERE. RUBENS, RAPHAEL. YOU'VE HEARD OF MUNICH, HAVEN'T YOU ? WHERE KING LUDVIG LIVED. THE KING WHO WENT MAD. HIS CASTLES ARE STILL THERE, JUST LIKE IN THE FAIRY TALES. [ Crying Continues ] AND FROM THERE IT'S NOT FAR TO THE ALPS. IMAGINE THE ALPS WITH SUN ON THEM... AND SNOW IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER. WHERE THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES AND THE LAURELS ARE GREEN AND THE ORANGES GLOW. WE'LL SET UP A HOTEL THERE, AND WE'LL HAVE SUCH A BUSY LIFE, YOU'LL SEE. TRAINS WHISTLING, COACHES COMING AND GOING, BELLS RINGING IN THE APARTMENT AND IN THE RESTAURANT. AND YOU WILL BE THE HEAD WAITRESS. I WILL SIT BEHIND THE COUNTER AND FIDDLE THE BILLS. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW EMBARRASSED PEOPLE ARE WHEN IT COMES TO PAYING. BUT YOU, YOU WILL BE THE HEAD WAITRESS. YOU WON'T HAVE TO SLAVE OVER A HOT STOVE. OH, NO. YOU'LL BE NICELY DRESSED, TALKING TO THE GUESTS. AND YOU WITH YOUR LOOKS-- I'M NOT FLATTERING YOU-- YOU'LL MAKE YOURSELF A GOOD CATCH ONE DAY. A RICH ENGLISHMAN. 'CAUSE ENGLISHMEN ARE SUCH AN EASY CATCH. AND THEN WE'LL BE RICH, AND WE'LL BUILD OURSELVES A VILLA ON LAKE COMO. AND IT-- IT DOES SOMETIMES RAIN THERE A LITTLE, BUT IT MUST SURELY BE SUNNY SOMETIMES AS WELL. ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS DARK. AND THEN WE-- [ Crying Continues ] OR ELSE WE-- WE CAN RETURN... HERE OR GO HOME. OR WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. [ Sniffling ] [ Softly ] DOES MISS JULIE BELIEVE ANY OF THIS ? [ Sobbing ] [ Sniffling ] SO YOU WERE PLANNING TO ESCAPE ? YOU LYING BASTARD ! WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE. WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE IN FRONT OF THE MISTRESS. [ Scoffs ] "MISTRESS" ? SHE'S STILL YOUR SUPERIOR. ARE YOU COMIN' TO CHURCH WITH ME OR NOT ? NO. NO. YOU GO AND YOU CONFESS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN UP TO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU STEAL FROM THE GROCERIES. ALL RIGHT, I WILL GO. AND I'LL COME BACK WITH ENOUGH FORGIVENESS FOR BOTH OF US. THE SAVIOR SUFFERED AND DIED ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SINS, AND IF WE GO TO HIM WITH FAITH AND REPENTANCE, HE'LL TAKE OUR SINS UPON HIMSELF. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ? I BELIEVE IT... AS TRULY AS I STAND HERE. IT'S BEEN MY BELIEF SINCE I WAS A CHILD, AND I'VE KEPT IT EVER SINCE. WHERE SIN OVERFLOWETH, THERE OVERFLOWETH GRACE. [ Gasps ] IF ONLY I HAD YOUR FAITH. [ Water Splashing ] WELL, GOD'S GRACE ISN'T GIVEN FOR EVERYONE TO RECEIVE. WHO DOES RECEIVE IT, THEN ? WELL, THE LORD DOES NOT FAVOR ANYONE, BUT THE LAST SHALL BE THE FIRST. [ Splashing Continues ] BUT THEN HE DOES FAVOR. HE FAVORS THE LAST. "AND IT'S EASIER FOR A CAMEL TO PASS THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE... THAN FOR A RICH MAN TO ENTER THE KINGDOM OF GOD." SEE, THAT'S HOW IT IS. ON MY WAY OUT, I'LL STOP AT THE STABLES AND TELL THEM NOT TO RELEASE ANY HORSES, JUST IN CASE ANYONE SHOULD WANT TO LEAVE BEFORE THE COUNT RETURNS. GOOD-BYE, MISS JULIE. [ Blade Scraping ] HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A HYPNOTIST IN THE THEATER ? WHEN THE MAN SAYS TO THE SUBJECT, "TAKE THE BROOM," AND HE TAKES IT. THEN HE SAYS, "NOW SWEEP," AND HE SWEEPS. DO THAT. YOU CAN. YOU WERE SO GOOD IN MY FATHER'S COAT. YOU WERE A REAL ARISTOCRAT. YOU CAN DO IT. IT'S LIGHT AND PEACEFUL, AND THE ROOM IS... FULL OF SMOKE. AND YOUR EYES ARE LIKE TWO GLOWING COALS... IN A DYING FIRE. I CAN FEEL THE HEAT FROM YOU. TELL ME TO TAKE THE BROOM. TAKE THE BROOM. THANK YOU. NOW TELL ME THAT THE FIRST MAY ALSO RECEIVE THE GIFT OF GRACE. SAY IT, EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT. YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THE FIRST ANYMORE. YOU BELONG TO THE LAST. THAT'S TRUE. [ Telephone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Ringing Continues ] YES, YOUR GRACE. MM-HMM. OF COURSE, SIR. YES, SIR. CERTAINLY, SIR. MM-HMM. NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK, SIR. [ Giggling ] [ Giggling Continues ]
