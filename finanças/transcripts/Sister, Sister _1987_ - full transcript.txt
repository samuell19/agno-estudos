[Music playing] [leaking roof] - Ah. Paul - Lucy. Lucy. I'm gonna get you. - Uh-huh. You better hurry. MATT RUTLEDGE: I will. LUCY BONNARD: Uh-huh. ETIENNE LEVIOLETTE: I'm right behind ya. [Music playing] CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Etienne, you still haven't fixed that screen door. We've got guests checkin' in in the mornin'. Yeah. I'll get right on it. - You look beautiful. Charlie? - Yes dear. - Wha-- Why do you always stop us playin'? - Well, it was fine when you were children. It's different now. - How? - It just is. Why don't you go with us tonight? You know how much you like to dance with Cleve. - (SINGING) Please be ready bout half past eight. - I can't. I still got two rooms to make up. - Did you take your pills? - Charlie, I'm feelin' so fine, I don't think I need to take'em anymore. - I am gonna read you a story when I get home. - Yeah. - Good. - You remember how mama used to dance with daddy? - With her feet on top of his feet? - Would you dance like that with Cleve tonight? - All right, for you. [Music playing] CLEVE DOUCET: Hey, ah-- I solved a big case today. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Really? CLEVE DOUCET: Yeah. Wanna hear about it? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Sure. - Well, there's this ah-- guy you see, and he's real nice and well liked and good lookin' too. He spent eight years wooing the same gal. But whenever the subject of marriage came up, she always wanted to talk about somethin' else. So the guy started gettin' a little frustrated. - Cleve. - Anyway, this woman happened to have a younger sister, a wonderful gal but a little-- a little delicate. Now the guy wanted to set a date but ah-- they couldn't, you see, 'cause, well, they have to wait for exactly the right moment when the sister can be told. Now, this part you're not gonna believe. Three years go by. Well, that's over 1,000 days and nights. And still, there's just no right time. - You just don't understand. - Now, wait, wait, I don't just solve this case today. See, I figure out what the guy's problem is. It has nothin' to do with the sister. No, see the plain and simple truth is that-- that the woman just doesn't love the guy enough-- - Cleve, no that's not true. - Sh, all right. I gave my friend some good advice. I told him to, you know, take his gal to the dance, same as always, and explain to her why it had to end. - No. - Go on Sheriff. - All right. [Music playing] - Ah. What are you doin' here? - The fan went in my shack. It got so hot I thought that maybe I could watch some TV. - You can use the one in the music room. Don't tell Charlotte. - Oh, no I won't. - Don't. - You know I like watching you move. - No. - See, now think you mind. - Ah. - Hope I'm not disturbing anything. I know I wasn't expected till tomorrow, but I had a hell of a week. And I just decided to get out of there early. I have a reservation. I'm Matt Rutledge. - Oh, I'm sorry. Um-- It's right here. Take Mr. Rutledge's bags to his room. MATT RUTLEDGE: You can call me Matt. - Follow me Matt. - More? - Mmm, thank you. I can't remember the last time I tasted real food. In DC I eat out all the time. - What is it you do Mr. Rutledge? - Matt. - Matt. - I'm a congressional aide. - Oh, well, that sounds important. - Well, not nearly as important as antique furniture, home cooked meals, bayou tours. LUCY BONNARD: Good-- good morning. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? - Where is Etienne? Now if he doesn't get here soon, it will-- - I'm right here. - Just be too hot. - I got the boat ready. Are you comin'? MATT RUTLEDGE: Yes, I am. Well, see you later. [Music playing] MATT RUTLEDGE: Who lives around here? ETIENNE LEVIOLETTE: Trappers, shrimpers, couple of psychos, like me. People have got a habit of gettin' lost out here. You know a lot of times, watch your head. They're never even heard from again. Course Lucy says they're all still out here. She thinks the swamp is haunted. You know, ghosts. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy? The others will be here any minute. - Thank you. - You weren't up when I got home last night. - Oh, I was tired. How was the dance? - Fine. - I started another painting for Cleve. - Oh, well, Cleve won't be comin' around here for a while. - Why? - Oh, we had a disagreement. - It was about me, wasn't it? [Bell rings] FRAN'S MOTHER: Yoo hoo. We're here. Anybody home? - Oh. Comin'. Lucy, don't be too friendly with the guest tonight, OK? - The house is lovely. Just like the pictures in the guidebook. Usually these places are so dirty. But this Is actually spotless as my own home in Inglewood. Frannie put those down. I don't want you to get a hernia and spoil my vacation. - It's OK, Ma. It's not OK. Lenny's not a schlepper. So what's your name? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: That's Beau. He's my sister's dog. - Come here Beau Beau. Come to mommy. Such a nice dog. Just like my Missy at home. How old? - Ah-- 16. - Awe. Too old to live. You better put him to sleep. [Dog growls] - This trip is costing me a fortune. But it beats Europe, terrorism not for me, and the French, they're not gettin' one penny of my money. - I'll show you to your rooms. - Lenny? Get my camera from the car. ETIENNE LEVIOLETTE: I saw the way that you were lookin' at Lucy, you know. - She's a pretty girl. - Yeah. But you know, she's crazy, that's all. She spent three years in a bug house. And now she can't get 100 yards away from The Willows without havin' a breakdown. You see, that's the only reason that they keep that place open 'cause it sure ain't the guests. But just in case that you got anything in mind, there's somethin' that you should know. Nobody gets into her pants. Nobody. Hey, you mind pickin' up that bird? - Sure. - Pick it up by the wings. - What the hell was that? - It was a gator snap. - I could have been killed. - You had enough? You want to go back? - Yeah, yeah, let's go back. - My husband was in the lace business. He was a genius. Now Lenny runs the company. If it wasn't for me, they'd both be starving. - Ma. - I'm only kidding. Lenny's a genius too. Lenny, give me that broccoli. Here, finish it. - Oh, no thank you. - So, what about you two? You're not married? FRAN STEUBEN: Ma. You're both nice girls. I wonder what's wrong with ya. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Well, there's nothing wrong with us. It's just that ever since our parents died, I had to take care of Lucy. - Boy, for a skinny guy, you sure do pack it away. Here, have some more. MATT RUTLEDGE: No, please really I couldn't possibly-- - You were saying? - Ah, well, one can't marry anybody. You have to wait for the right man, as they say. - I know what you mean, especially around here. You don't want some guy in a loin cloth who just fell out of a tree. - Ma. - Exactly. Some more wine? - Yes, please. Whoa, thank you. - What about Lucy? Doesn't she get any? - Ah, Lucy doesn't drink. - Well, I-- um-- I think I will have some tonight. Just um-- a little bit. - If there's somethin' funny, why don't you share ti with all of us? - Relax. They like each other. Anybody can see that. Give both of these girls something to drink. [Music playing] - The rain's here. It's-- it's just been dry for a month. FRAN'S MOTHER: Well, I, for one, am relieved. [Inaudible] in here. So what do we do now? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Maybe Lucy will tell us a story. - What? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: She tells wonderful ghost stories, maybe because she really believes in them. - Please. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Why don't you tell us about Widow's Cove? MATT RUTLEDGE: So I was just out there this afternoon. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: I'm sure Mr. Rutledge would be fascinated by your ideas on the subject. - Yes, I would. - It's um-- it's where they live, the ghost. You see, I saw them once. They showed themselves to me. FRAN'S MOTHER: What happened? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: It's nothing to worry about. Go on, Lucy. LUCY BONNARD: I heard a voice calling out my name. It was dark so I knew not to go out. But the voice just kept at me. And I found myself heading deep into the cove. Well, of course, they were all there, the fishermen, the trappers, some families, children even. I'm-- I'm not afraid to look the dead in the face. But their eyes, there's such longing in their eyes. You see, I could tell they were my friends. They wanted to protect me. A-- a-- all the people from the parish, anyone whoever died in the swamp. Then I heard the voice again. I turn around and there was a boy. He was different from the others. His eyes were hollow. And his skin, oh, God his-- his skin was decayed. And he was trying to come to me. But the others wouldn't let him pass. They were protecting me. Jud wanted to kill me. It was Jud. - Lucy, that's enough. LENNY STEUBEN: Who was the boy? - Oh, that was just another figment of her imagination. - Agh. - What? ETIENNE LEVIOLETTE: I think the generator's just blown. - Oh. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: I'll get the keys. - I-- I'll close the windows. MATT RUTLEDGE: I'll help. - We're in a nut house here. LUCY BONNARD: This is the ball room. We never use it anymore. [Thunder and lightning] [music playing] LUCY BONNARD: I have to shut the attic window. [Music playing] MATT RUTLEDGE: Hmm. Did you do these? - Oh, yes. You hate them? MATT RUTLEDGE: Not at all. Huh. Is this you? - No. Yes, oh, I don't-- I don't know. MATT RUTLEDGE: Didn't mean to-- LUCY BONNARD: Here we go again. MATT RUTLEDGE: Ready? [Music playing] - Oh shit. Shit! [Music playing] FRAN'S MOTHER: What's that smell? FRAN STEUBEN: I don't smell anything. FRAN'S MOTHER: That's 'cause you got a deviated septum. What's wrong with your hair? It dropped. FRAN STEUBEN: It's the moisture and the mildew. FRAN'S MOTHER: Did you bring the fluid for your soft lenses? FRAN STEUBEN: Ma. - Where are you sleeping? - With my husband. - Suppose I have to go. - Night mother. - You have any water in your room? I probably won't sleep. [Music playing] - Good night again. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Beau. Beau, come on. Come on. Lucy? Lucy? Are you asleep? LUCY BONNARD: Come in. - Where's Mr. Rutledge? - In bed I suppose. Oh, is everyone else asleep? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Your behavior with that boy tonight was ridiculous. LUCY BONNARD: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I brought you your pill. Do you want me to read you a story? - Um-- no, you know, I'm just going to go straight to sleep. I'm kinda tired. - Good night Beau. - Good night. - Your sister treats you like a child. - No, you don't understand. - What is that pill for? - It keep me steady. Does that make you nervous? - No. Huh-uh. - I'd like you to go now. Good night. Good night. - Good night. [Music playing] [clocks chiming] FRAN'S MOTHER: Shut off already. Ah, we're moving to the Holiday Inn in the morning. Ah. [Thunder rolling] [music playing] [dog whines] [music playing] - So, who's hungry now? Come on, I wont' let ya starve. You go to the Holiday Inn, you call room service. You're out here in the fuckin' woods, you gotta get it yourself. What I'm doin' here in the first place, I don't that to begin with, in the middle of a swamp with a bunch of French nuts tellin' fuckin' ghost stories I heard in summer camp. But you're not crazy, Beau. You're the nicest one here. Now eat slow. Chew your food. Don't gum it to death. [Thunder rolls] [music playing] - Ho. Not for me. [Bells ringing] [knocking] CLEVE DOUCET: Can I come in? - Ah-- heh. Of-- of course. - I just-- - Yes, oh, you go. - Well, I stopped by for two reasons actually. I wanted to make sure the rain didn't knock the house down. - Oh, not this time, heh, heh, although the--the roof does look a little shaky. - Yeah. - And? - Yeah. - Well, the other reason you came by. - Oh, yeah, um-- my rain coat, I left it here last time. I thought I'd take it to mass 'cause it looks like it might-- - Well, it must be in the hall closet. - Charlie, forget the coat for a moment. Ah-- look, about the other night I-- I-- I don't want you to think I don't understand about Lucy, 'cause I do. I know she had a rough time once, well, I mean, you both did. But-- but sugar she's fine now. Has been for a while. You just can't see it. - You just don't understand, do ya? She is fine because I made her fine. Ah. - You goin' to the nine? - No, we're goin' on later. - Yeah. LUCY BONNARD: Charlie, you seen Beau? Was Cleve here? - He was. - Well, ain't he takin' us to mass? - No. - Why not? - Because he's not. Stop bein' so nosy and get to work. I'm sure you'll want everything nice and tidy when your precious little Matt co-- - OK. I wo-- I'll do the vacuumin'. [Music playing] - Ah. Aaaagggggh. - Matty, I know you like the girl, but go home. Come on kids. - Now, I don't think he spent the night here. ROGER: Looky here, Sheriff. - Hmm. Quite a collection. - Here's our boy now. - Come on. Where you been, Etienne? - I've been trappin'. What happened? - Lucy's dog got killed here last night. - I didn't do nothin'. - You better put that gun down. - All right. Somebody kill that dog and I'm the asshole. [Gun shot] - Shit. ROGER: WF1 this is WF2, you 10-4 my traffic? POLICE OFFICER ON RADIO: Go ahead. - We got a situation here, exact 10-20 The Willows. ROGER: I think the best thing for everybody to do right now is just-- just clear outta here. - Lucy's not up to making a trip. - Listen, sugar, is there somthin' you're not, you know, you're not tellin' me here? You any idea where this might a come from? - Ah. CLEVE DOUCET: Lucy? - Oh, now just stop this. You're terrorizin' her. - All right, all right. - I want all of you to leave right now. CLEVE DOUCET: Matt, come on. Help me with the dog. - Sure. Lucy? I'll be back. CLEVE DOUCET: Lock it up and stay inside. Call me if he shows up, ya hear? Oh, we'll probably come down-- never mind. Damn! Well, I guess that pretty well sums it up. MATT RUTLEDGE: Sheriff? CLEVE DOUCET: Yeah? - What about the dog? - What about it? - What are we gonna do with his body? - I don't know, stuff it. - I think he should be buried. - Oh, you do, do ya? Well, all right. All right, let's go bury the damn dog. LUCY BONNARD: The same night, can't you see that? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Be quiet. LUCY BONNARD: It's Jud's knife. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy, sh, no calm down. LUCY BONNARD: It's his, Chalie. He's come back. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Just listen to me. You don't know what you're talkin' about. LUCY BONNARD: Every night to help me sleep. But he can't sleep. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Please. You're gettin' yourself all worked up over nothin'. LUCY BONNARD: What 's goin' on here. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy. LUCY BONNARD: What we did was wrong. What we did was wrong, Charlie. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Sh, Lucy. LUCY BONNARD: It's banyans That's what the dead do. They take their banyans. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Just stop it now. LUCY BONNARD: That's the best way. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy. You promised me that you would never talk about this. LUCY BONNARD: By hurting us one way. - Don't you remember? - First it's gonna be Beau. - Do you want me to call Dr. Mootah? I will if I have to. Huh? - No. You don't have to. - Good. - Oh, Charlie, I'm not crazy. - Go to your room. - What? - Go to your room. I'll make you some tea. [Music playing] - What are you doin' here? - I didn't do nothin'. LUCY BONNARD: Of course you didn't. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy, go back to bed. - But Charlie-- - Be quiet. - I know why you're doin' this. So they wouldn't think that it's you. - What do you mean? - There's only one person in this house that's used to killin'. And you been doin' it since you were 18. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. - I'm talkin' about that boy, Jud Nevins. I'm talkin' about what you did to him. - It's just-- ah-- get out. - Because they never found his body, that doesn't mean you didn't kill'im. You played innocent. And everybody, they believe you. But not me. Not me. I never believed-- LUCY BONNARD: Charlie! [Speaking foreign language] - You be careful, Lucy. [Music playing] - She's gonna get you. If you touch her, you're a dead man. It take works. It takes work to feed the dead. You'll never make it out alive. - You told him. - Nope. I didn't. - Well, how did he know then? - He saw us. That night when you asked me to go back for Jud's cat, Etienne was standin' there. - Why didn't you tell me this before? - Because I didn't want to. Just let it go, Charlotte. - I'm gonna take care of this. - You will not hurt him. - I'll handle it. - When Matt comes back-- - Matt's not comin' back. - What? - Cleve is sendin' a man to pick up his clothes. - Why, I don't understand. - He's gone. He's left for home. - Why, did you say somethin' to him about me? - He was just toyin' with you. That's what men do. Why don't you just lie back and close your eyes and just forget all about it. I'll make ya somethin' special. Here, how 'bout some music? And who loves you more than anybody in the world? - Charlotte. - Why? - Because I'm her dolly. - I love you. - I know you do. - I'll bring you your pill. [Thunder rolling] MATT RUTLEDGE: I just saw Etienne. He is completely out of his-- - Sorry, I can't let you in. - His-- his-- I don't understand. I told Lucy I was going meet her here. - She doesn't want to see you. - I don't believe you. - Well, I don't care what you believe. My sister told me to tell you good bye. Here's your bag. - Can I at least get a bandage? Heh, please. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Ah-- wait, here. I'll be right back. [Music playing] - Lucy. Lucy. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Mr. Rutledge. Mr. Rutledge! - I just wanted to say good bye. Listen, have I offended you somehow? If so, I apologize. I didn't mean to. - Matt? - Huh. [Music playing] - Matt! Matt!

Sheriff? - Do me a favor, Rog. Get me the file on the Nivens case. - She said you weren't coming back. [Music playing] - (HUMMING) YOUNG CHARLOTTE: He should have been invited daddy. MR.

It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. I've got you. What happened? - S0-- someone killed Etienne. Someone killed him. - Lucy, who do you think did it? Huh? Who else is here? Who else is in this house? - No one, just-- just you and-- and me and Charlotte. - That's right. - No. - It's her. - No, you're wrong. No she wouldn't. - Think about it, Lucy. She has lied to you all along, hasn't she? Hasn't she? She is a dangerous woman, Lucy, and unless we do something about it, I could be next. - Oh, no. No. I won't-- I won't let anything happen to you. I won't. You're my prince. [Music playing] CHARLOTTE BONNARD: What are you doin', Lucy? - Stay away from me. - Lucy? What is this all about? - I was out there. I saw what you did to Etienne. You murdered him. - Honey, you're hallucinatin' again. Etienne-- Etienne's not dead. He's-- he's just gone. - He dies in my arms, Charlotte. - Did you take your pills today? LUCY BONNARD: Don't do that to me, not any more. - What do mean? - You've been druggin' me all along so I wouldn't tell. You put me in an institution so I wouldn't tell. - Oh, my God, Lucy. LUCY BONNARD: You're my sister. - Baby. - And you poisoned me. - We gotta get some help. Damn! Lucy. Lucy, listen to me. We are in grave danger here. Lucy, here, look at this picture. Who is it? Who do you see? - Matt? - No, it's Jud, not Matt. Matt is his little brother. LUCY BONNARD: Liar. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Lucy. You never knew Jud. Matt is just like him. He tries to hide it. But it's still there. He has planned out this whole thing. He has turned us against each other. Lucy, you have to trust me. MATT RUTLEDGE: Where's my [inaudible]? LUCY BONNARD: We can go now. - Lucy, he wants to kill both of us. MATT RUTLEDGE: Lucy is that loaded? Is it? You should be very careful with that. - Jud used to call you his little shadow, remember Matt? - What? - Little shadow. MATT RUTLEDGE: What? What are you talking about? CHARLOTTE BONNARD: You know what I'm talkin' about. Oh, I should have recognized you before now. You're just like Jud. Don't trust him, Lucy. Please don't give him that gun. - Let her think for herself. - You know I would never hurt you. Baby, come on. Mm-hmm. MATT RUTLEDGE: That's right. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: No Lucy. - Matt? - Wait for me. [Music playing] [shot gun blast] MATT RUTLEDGE: You didn't think I'd ever come back. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: You don't understand about your brother. It was an accident. MATT RUTLEDGE: I saw it. Oh, my God. I saw everything you did. I saw you dump my brother's body in the swamp. And I watched you stand up to the court and swear before God that it never happened. So I waited. CHARLOTTE BONNARD: Waited for what? MATT RUTLEDGE: To hear you tell me the truth. I want to hear you say that you killed my brother. - No, it was an accident. He tried to rape me. - I wanna hear you say it. - He'll hurt Lucy, stop. - Come on, I wanna hear it from you. Say it. - No. - Say it! - No. - Ah. Ah. Ah. - Come on. We have to hurry. Come on.

The law said they didn't kill my brother. CLEVE DOUCET: Well, what about the rest of your family? Now what they gonna think about all this? MATT RUTLEDGE: I let them down 'cause I never told them what happened. I never told anyone. I was too scared. CLEVE DOUCET: Well, ah-- you know, maybe they'll forgive you now. - Forgive me? [Shot gun blast] [music playing] - Ah. Etienne! - He's gone now. - Etienne! MATT RUTLEDGE: He can't help you now. LUCY BONNARD: Etienne! MATT RUTLEDGE: Don't worry, I've got ya.
