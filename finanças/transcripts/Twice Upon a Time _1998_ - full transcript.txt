What makes you think that he's gonna ask you? Oh, it's just a feeling. Funny thing is I don't know exactly what I'll say. - Here we go, - thank you, I love them and anything, it's just that I look at what everyone else has in their lives and I think is that what I really want. Ever do that? What? Awful isn't it? My trainer says I have to gag three of these down a day. What I would give for a salad. You are so lucky you can eat that. Most people would get really fat.

Look I just want to know, is this going to last much longer? - Well I don't know I mean I think there's got a few more picks to take and then I thought after we'd have some dinner with you know some of these guys, with the photographer Okay and some of the other people Okay well Do you mind if I meet you later cause I was hoping to see Maggie, maybe do something with her. - Maggie? but she takes classes - what kind of classes? - The kind of classes people take when they've got nothing better to do with their lives You know, like I saw Nick's sister the other day and I think that all she really needs is just a little encouragement and she really blossoms. That's pretty much true for everybody though... I don't know, I don't think it happens to me. Sometimes I never feel inspired Come on - what? - I want to say you're a great producer that has to take at least some inspiration you know... - What about you and... I mean, if you don't mind my asking - how did you two fall in love? We fall in love... um I don't know... It was a gradual thing. We were acquaintances and then friends and then best friends and uh... best friends who kiss on the mouth. Oh, it was just perfect. I mean... wasn't it? I mean. When I first met her, she wasn't a producer, didn't want to be a producer but uh... I encouraged her, I knew she could do it. You know that's what it is about you. What? Just the way that you put your faith into people. It's like you are inspiration I... I think it's really just about being there for each other. But believe me, without her I'd be nothing. - You don't think so! - Yeah I... I know so. Trust me. Wait, let's just stop talking about me. Okay. About you guys. Isn't he gonna sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers next year or what? - Oh let's not talk about Nick. - How come? I did, 't think you'd be home so soon. Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. We got to talk. Yeah I think so. - I don't get you. - Me? You don't get me? what don't you get about me? - You want a list? - There is nothing not to get about me Nick, I'm the most gettable person you're ever gonna meet. Yeah Okay. First, let's start with these. I found these letters in this brown jacket. Why are people offering to give you things - a free gift for you - what other kind of gift is there? And can you explain to me exactly why this is written backwards? Nick, give it a rest, it's junk mail. "Junk mail", "free gifts", what is this? Elizabeth code? And I also found this little puppy onto that Joe fella? Give me that. Why are you getting his backward letters? It's from Dartmouth College. He applied for a research grant and they're gonna fund it. He never told... Well, maybe he did. Is it that Dartmouth College that advertises on the side of the buses? No, a different one. Right. So why exactly would you be calling us all of a sudden? Yeah. Yeah whatever - It's Peg - Who? Your mother. Nick, you know my mother died when I was... Yeah... Nick. When was the shot for cancer invented? 30 years ago? Oh, my God. Mom. I remember this set from when I was a kid. Oh, I've had this forever. The cookie jar too. I know the cookie jar and your perfume. I had forgotten your perfume. Do you remember how I used to spray it on the dog when you were little. I know how ridiculous you thought I was. You were at my high school graduation? - Well of course you were. - What? - My high school graduation. - Oh, yes and you wanted to wear shorts under your gown instead of that nice dress. What color was it? - I don't remember exactly. - Blue. I think with with lace, oh you hated that lace. Not sophisticated enough We went around and found about that one. Aunt Charlotte too. We won. What's wrong? Nothing. It's good to talk to you, to see you again. It's been too many years. Here's one with you and your aunt Charlotte, oh you two were really team. Oh, there we are. Why haven't we spoken? It doesn't matter anymore. God knows mothers and daughters fight sometimes, more than sometimes if the truth were known and it was probably my fault for making you choose between Nick and me. Well, I'm gonna put these away, I don't want to spoil the day. - No no it's not that What is it, Sweetie? I was thinking about this friend of mine whose mom died of cancer - Cancer? Didn't she get the shot? No, she didn't get the shot. My friend knew that her mom was dying and she wanted to be in the room with her. She wanted to be able to hold her hand when it happened but they wouldn't let her in the room. They wouldn't let her say goodbye. Happily ever after is highly overrated Well I guess I'd better get back. You don't sound too thrilled. Well, you know, you never know what Nick has lined up. Can I say something here? This... this is maybe none of my business. You guys need to talk about things. Things? You, know tell him that you love him I do love him So you're... you're beautiful, you're intelligent. You think so? I know so and if you guys love each other and you're meant to be together, you'll do whatever it takes. Whatever it takes? You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that. In Einstein's opinion, time has no space nor boundaries and thus was constantly interchangeable with no set rules. There are conceivably an infinite number of worlds being created every second - Hi! Each one filled with new scenarios - Oh, hi. Einstein, huh? - Uh-huh. Boy he's on the show a lot. Given the basic principles underlying Einstein's theory... - How's it going with you and Joe - oh great - alternative... - Good. He sure likes you a lot. - Oh Yes... Work! Listen, do you think he might be? Popped the question anytime soon no? Well, you know that's probably for the best because you don't want to rush into these things, especially if you're feeling it all uncertainty Believe me Alannah, Marriage is no big relax... it's a lot of hard work. You shouldn't do it unless you're absolutely ready. Yeah? Yeah. - Hi Sandy. - Hi What's down? More than meets the eye it seems like. I need your signature. Mighty interesting advice you were giving Alannah. Vee - Guess - Abta What's with this habit of writing your name backwards? Sandy, what would you say if I told you that I was from an alternate universe? Oh, come on. It is quite possible You're serious. Let's put it this way. I'm not the same Beth that you knew - and who's Beth? - I'm Beth. - No you're Elizabeth. Given the basic principles underlying Einstein's theory of relativity it is quite possible that alternate universes exist. Einstein believed that alternate worlds were logical, indeed possible. In Einstein's opinion time has no space nor boundaries and thus was constantly interchangeable with no sense This is really tricky so are you like inhabiting her body or something? - I don't know maybe we just switched places - so in your universe, you're not Elizabeth you're Beth - yeah - and Beth is a total rat who would make a play for someone else's boyfriend which is what you're doing here even though you're Elizabeth. Further explanation may be required. No I swear, I have never heard of them, not Regis nor Kathie Lee. - Well they consistently beat our show in any market where we go head to head - but our show is one top honor - yeah but in the other world, our show's stupid - Oh boomer - but you're the boss - yeah? - On a stupid show? - Yeah but you don't care... - because? - Because you make lots of money We're producing a show that's stupid. So, you're dating Alannah's boyfriend in the other world - No no Alannah is dating my boyfriend in this world But you've got Nick. What's so special about this Joe guy anyway? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Excuse me, a message. Thank you. Can you read this for me? It's from mr nothing. He wants to see you this afternoon. Okay I want to know all about Joe but first let's get back to me and how in your universe I am the boss - well you wore a lot of nice suits you see in my world there are 50 scenes in... Our nation's 50th state plus personal remembrances of baseball legend Fidel Castro who has all-star pitcher for the Havana Rebels Is Hawaii a state? - Yes - Okay what about Iowa or Missouri? Both yes. See I've been going over the map in my head and I can't figure out which one's missing it's driving me crazy. - Excuse me - Oh, hi. - I hope I'm not interrupting - No no. - Joey! Oops, suddenly got crowded in here. - Nice to see you - I didn't know you were coming down here to take me to lunch. Well, actually, I didn't. I came to uh to meet with the about the uh the segment. Yeah we're finishing the treatment. Treatment Oh, sure. I was um gonna have lunch in my office anyway I have um you know... stuff... to do. - Okay um... I'll call you. Is there some place we can go and talk in private? Yeah um... - why don't we go backstage? - Okay. Follow me Elizabeth, can I get you a a mug of decaf brand or or do you want some tap water or - no I'm fine, I'm just making protein logs or bread, do you want lunch Brett! You know I feel like we've really hit it off the last couple days, am I am I right? - Oh yeah yeah - and um I hope this isn't inappropriate but I wanted to ask you... Do you think Alannah would like this? Every time I think he's gonna pop the question, I just... shut down I'm... I don't want to be my mother. I have plans, I have dreams. Why can't it just stay the way it is and I could have the best of both worlds? I deserve to have it all, don't you think? Oh, absolutely. You saw it. You actually saw this ring? Was it big? Oh forget I asked that what difference is this? - Alannah - what? - It was big. Oh I knew it would be. He probably has it hidden around the house someplace huh? - In a sock drawer. Or someplace. I just wish that I knew that he was the... Because if I say no or just let me think about it, it's probably going to be over between us - You think so? So um... what do you think I should do about this? Hey, let me think about it. Hi Hi, - I thought you're at work, I was just on my way out - oh it's monday. - Oh monday - yeah, so I thought I'd come over and um talk to you - Oh about the article - and things Cool, come in. So, uh... So... - Dog lover huh? - I love dogs. Hi, Jefferson. No it's... it's Rover. - Rover? - After the president. Everybody ready but he's here. We've got a little wrinkly head here. What did you want? You want to talk about it? Oh, hey, okay. - I don't know what that was - it was us and it was right. - I'd love someone else. - No you don't realize it now but, Joe, you actually love me. - I love Alannah - no you think she's uh she's uh gaskinated. - Gaskinated? You know from the crossword, one who boasts and brags. What are you talking about? I'm sorry Joe I didn't realize it till now but I want you. - Okay you're married all right you don't really know me though But I do! And I miss you I miss the way that you move your head back and forth when you brush your teeth in the bathroom and I miss the way that you cry every time you hear Sarah Vaughan sing that song that you love, you know what song I'm talking about. Come on you know your grandma taught it to you and I miss the way that you dance around your underwear every time you hear Chaka Khan come on the radio Okay, how do you know I dance around the room to shock - Come here - no but Joe I'm sorry I was so rapid myself I didn't even realize that you'd shaved off your goatee - goatee? - and he probably told me about the grand at Dartmouth and I just didn't hear it - Dartmouth? Well they want you and I want you. Dartmouth is a trade school for dental assistants. Okay but this is obviously my fault and I sent you the wrong signal that's Okay but I'm really sorry really - look Joe Joe I have the letter you just got from Dartmouth, that's for Joe Townsend It's a letter for another Joe not me Okay? I suggest you find him, you give this to him, you'd be very encouraging and supportive of him and his pursuit of a career in dental hygiene. Okay? Bye now. Oh. Okay, Beth. It really is time to wake up now. Please be a normal airplane... You okay? - I'm fine I'm fine - all right, Alannah called. She knows you're here. - Well good I want to talk to her I think it's time we had this whole thing out she has to understand that I believe that certain things are meant to be - about your mother - What about my mother? - Alannah doesn't quite understand but they've sent for a doctor. She's here, she's here. Oh Elizabeth. I came over to see if there was anything I could do with... Elizabeth I am so sorry - I'm Dr Ramy it's really better you don't see her right now - no you don't understand I have to see her where is she? - Oh let her see me for Petes's sake. - Mom! Easy you don't want the rope to come open. I thought you were... I am... that's why I was trying to get a holdi♪♪♪ in the first place. Oh sweetheart, this happens to a lot of people. You get a good deal on some real estate and you have to make hard choices. - What? - I'm going to Cuba. I was on the statehood committee and they gave me a good deal on some beachfront and I'm moving. 6 I kind of got the message wrong, I'm really sorry. Elizabeth I mean they said they were rushing it out... - I put off everything till the last day I was supposed to have a physical for the visa weeks ago. Sorry, Elizabeth. Hold on, hold on. Cuba? Sweetheart, there's no reason to be this upset. We can see each other as much as you want. You can visit you, come there. I come here, we can talk every day if you want. Oh, let me give you my new number. Cinco cinco cinco... - mom do you have to go? No I mean it. I don't want you to go. I want you to stay and I want us to be together and and make everything like it should have been all along I'm... That's what I want. It's funny. After you left the other day I thought why would she tell me that story about the girl whose mother died? Then it hit me. It was about us, right? Growing up, you got the double whammy kiddo that's for sure. Your father left, then I got so hung up with my own tough luck I forgot there was another person in the house. The two people you loved the most pulled away from you. Some ways I might as well have died. Don't say that! I saw the pictures of us. Oh don't kid me, I watched you. It was like you were staring at strangers in those pictures. Mom do you remember when I was 10? You used to say to me "Beth it's a new morning put on a nice clean dress and a big fat smile and start the day". - I said that? - Yeah and that's what I want us to do now. I want us to put on nice clean dresses and big fat smiles and start the day and everything can be perfect. It's never a perfect world Sweetie. But that should never stop us from trying with all our hearts to make it that way. In the morning, afternoon, evening, whenever you need that extra punch to make yourself look good, rely on this. You got a date you got anything that weekend, this lasts like five hours all you gotta do is put on some more, no building hang??? Come on. Hang on a minute. Hi. - Is Nick home? - Sort of uh for my... new boss's niece. He probably won't get to it today so you know, just tell him I'll come back tomorrow and pick him up. Thank you bye. Maggie I saw you tap dancing. Nick told me where you took lessons. He likes sending people over for a good laugh. No, you were good. Really good. Thanks. Maggie, do you want to be on television? - Me? - Yeah my show's doing a segment on ancient tribal dances and I need to find somebody to choreograph it and... Choreograph? Choreograph? I don't know, I'm not that good. - Sure you are. - Look, I just do it for fun. It's not... I'm not professional or anything. I don't do it for a living. Could I maybe be one of the dancers? And do you have costumes because I can make them, I could sew. - I got clothes in my closet. - Oh Alannah! Listen, did you talk to Joe about yesterday? Well... do you still want my advice about this guy? I don't think you're gonna like what I'll say but if you're smart, you'll listen. You meet me in an hour? Okay. Okay I'll be here. Are you Okay? No not you, bye. I gotta go but keep working on it. - Was this thing expensive? - Oh no we got five or six of those. I'll see you in an hour I mean soon. Thanks, bye. The plot thickens. Jefferson, you don't tell on me, Okay? Just remember, I was the one that fed you. Good Jefferson. Rover, sorry. Come on, where are you, where are you? Yes! - Oh how are you doing? - Good evening sir - party of two uh miss uh Alannah - ah yes. - Right, this way, - Okay Great. It was a really poorly kept secret that you were gonna ask me to marry you so uElizabeth convinced me to take the lead in case you got hot feet. - You dipped all this? - Yeah Would you believe that in some universes you couldn't arrange a wedding like this in three and a half hours... with live entertainment! This is unbelievable It just shows what you can do with a little inspiration. She made me realize what was important and that I couldn't risk losing you. I don't have a ring. Good bye. You're going? - I think it's better if I do. - For who? For me. Elizabeth, I don't quite know how to thank you for this. But I don't get this Well, I have a four by four with an eight track and a microwave and I don't get that either. Look. You got a great guy in your life. Remember he's the one you want. I know. I just have to figure out how I can get back to him. This isn't your wedding? No, why don't you just rub it in? You know the words? Oh some of them, I had a boyfriend. Oh this guy used to know like that song - Why don't you sing it? - I don't know if I know all the words Oh you probably do, try it. Love is wonderful the second time around just as wonderful. Put both feet on the ground, it's the second time you've heard your love song song. It makes you think perhaps that love like youth is wasted on the young. That's it. Love's more comfortable the second time you fall like a friendly heart the second time you call who knows what let us to this miracle we found there are those who bet that love comes once and yet I'm so glad we met the second time around... - Sounds nice with the right words - what do you mean? - How long you been here? - Here? In this universe? - You too? Snapped a wishbone, Thanksgiving day, 1972. Didn't you ever think about going back? No I waited too long. But listen, if you're thinking about going back, do it soon otherwise it's going to be too late Well you suppose that maybe if I go to the same place at the same time... It'll work in reverse. Don't you want to keep it for yourself? No, you know the song White christmas? - Yeah. - In this world, they think I wrote it and I'm making a lot of bucks off of that one. Well thanks, maybe I'll try it next Thanksgiving Good luck. Your keys, madam. - Good night. - Good night and have a happy thanksgiving what? Hi, I'm back. It's tomorrow Thanksgiving? - I... Yes, second tuesday in december - Great Can you do me a favor? - Pull. - Okay. - Did I get the big half? - You did. Great. I'll see you around... I hope Happy Thanksgiving. She's really stressed in. Her mother's going to Cuba. - No that's right, come here. Better late than never ..final boarding call for flight C-100 to Havana. This is your final boarding call for flight C-100 to Havana. Mom, wait. I was hoping you'd been... I wasn't gonna let you go again without saying goodbye. - Again? Mom I want you to know that, no matter what, you're always going to be in my heart. It doesn't matter if I can't see you or touch you. It won't change anything, Okay? Elizabeth what are you trying to say? Can you just call me Beth, just once please I can hear it. Goodbye Beth. Seetheart, I'm not gonna be so far away. You never were. Now, what? Two things First, if I wake up tomorrow morning I seem a little bit more like my old self - yeah? - Tell me to stop acting like a brat to call my mother. Here's her number. Second, you need to get me to that bed and breakfast before midnight - Oh, what? Nick, step on it. All right, all right. It's nice of you to do this, really. Well, you tell me that the old Elizabeth is coming back and I am there, but I do not get this flea bag bed and breakfast. Frankly I prefer the catamaran and the thong bikini. Well you know what, Nick, I'm sure that somewhere in space and time there's an Elizabeth who has the guts to wear a thong and was just blown away by that whole catamaran experience and wants to get her back to you. This is how we can do it. I'm really sorry for waking you up. Upstairs, on your left, number seven. Seven? Oh no I can't have room seven I need room nine. Last time we were in room 9! I'm sorry it's not made up yet No but there's a reason why - what reason? What reason? What reason? What is the reason? - This is ridiculous. - Okay Okay Okay. This is the reason last time we were in room nine and I came downstairs looking for coffee, remember, do you remember? And you said you don't serve coffee well there is another couple in room nine who do... does drink coffee - you had two couples in room nine? - Different room 9 - there's only one room 9 That's what you think Look make up your mind. I mean this is totally ridiculous - I know this sounds mind-boggling but what I'm hoping is that I can get back to them and they're still there and only a minute or so has passed in their time at least that's what Albert Einstein thinks and - That's your reason? - That's mind-boggling Yes, that's my reason. All right look hold on look the other reason is she's hot to trot♪♪♪ Nixon says "go for it". There you are, Elizabeth. Knock yourself out. Yeah, it's the frumpy girl that wears baggy pajamas to bed. You must be from another world. Nick stop it. _ Ouh what's your name? - Beth. My name is Beth. You know, not too aggressive, it's a little weird. - Okay I'm sorry all right I didn't mean to yell. I'm just under a lot of pressure. I've got a lot of stuff on my mind. Okay No more wishbones, back to tuna noodle casserole. Okay get in bed. Then what? - And then you go to sleep - and then what? And then, I go to sleep, and then I wake up and you're somebody else. No offense. I got to be somebody else no no no no no no no listen to me right now there are about a million women in the federated states of america that are fantasizing about Nick Fowler, no no, you want to be somebody else, hey that's cool, cause frankly, the way you've been acting lately, I wish you were somebody else. No but me, I am Nick Fowler. My point exactly. Yeah well you know as long as we get that straight. Oh please let this work. Come on, come on, come on, come on... Sometimes things don't work out the same way twice. But sometimes they do. I'm gonna put on a nice clean dress and a big fat smile and start a new day. Meanwhile... in another life. Nick! Elizabeth. Oh, thank God! I had this horrible dream... I was in... I was in some other universe. Well you know, come on, these games are just getting in the way - No, listen there was this guy sleeping next to me and I couldn't wake him up and then I went through his wallet and he didn't have any money. He didn't even have any credit cards. No platinum card, and our car it was gone and some hunk of junk was in its place. Beth? S'il vous plaît, Madame, il y a des gens qui dorment à cette heure-ci! You're French you're French again! Ecoutez, Madame, c'est vraiment pas tolérable! Vous êtes français, je suis tellement contente! C'est incroyable! I'll handle this! Hey, how come you didn't tell me you got a research grant? I think I applied for one but I haven't... No, you got it, I have a letter. You got a letter? No, I had a letter. You had a letter? Hang on, I'll come up and explain everything. OK It came in the mail. I got it out of the mailbox. Nicky, I just want to make sure the car is there. I don't want to mess around with alternative universe cars. I mean you know, breakfast something. Wait wait, you do have the letter or you don't have the letter? I'm confused. - No I had it I had it but believe me, you got it, you got it. - I got the grant. And you just... you got the grant and you deserve it and you deserve everything great, believe me, I have a lot invested in you, buddy, and I plan to see it pay off. - The car's still here what are you talking about? - What? No, I did not tell Nick's sister that she could be on TV. Oh she is? Oh yeah, I thought she was pretty good. Yeah that's why I... you know... told her... - There's nothing wrong with the car. Honey, if I take this grant I'm gonna have to move to like the farthest corner of New Guinea. I love New Guinea. I can't ask you to quit your job Oh forget about the job, I already quit. I want to do my own show I want to do a show about real people, something I can really care about. Listen, I have tons of ideas and I want your input on everything. - Wait wait wait back it up you want my input on? - Shut up and kiss me. I love it when you say that. Oh, I knew you would. Come here. You
