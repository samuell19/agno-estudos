For over 500 years, our island has been a battleground fought over and ruled by outsiders. From the Italian Columbus, who came to our shores and began the New World by killing and enslaving us to the Spanish Conquistadores, English pirates, French emperors, American soldiers and all the way until today when our new foreign masters are the cartels. Did you know we've never had our own cartel? If only someone had the vision... ...and the will. - Do you have any idea who you're stealing from? - DEA, asshole. Oh, shit. Keep your mouth shut, Luis. The Sarge is gonna get us out of this. The Sarge is back in Puerto Rico, Danny. What is he gonna do? What was that, lovebirds? Talking about all that ass play you'll be getting in prison? Don't let them fool you, Luis. You're in the U.S. now. You know what that means? It means that the cops have lots and lots of rules. Isn't that right, agent? You know, for a fat chick, you sure have small tits. You know, why don't you exercise your right to shut your bitch mouth before Agent Morales shoves his size 12 up your ass. Oh, he's Agent Morales? You know, I heard that the smartest thing to ever come out of Morales' mouth is his partner's cock. Look like I hit home. Scare tactics. Don't worry. It's okay. - Something I said, agent? - Something you are, shitbag, and that's a shitbag shitbag. Do you blow your father with that mouth? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right. All right. All right. Shit, Morales, he's not breathing. In front of a goddamn witness. No, no, wait, wait, wait, man. Wait. Wait. Wait! Wait! Special Agent Prentiss of the FBI. Special Agent Prentiss of the FBI! - What about him? - I'm working for him. I'm his C.I. - You're the FBI's inside man? - Yeah. That bust last week, I gave them that. Today was just a test run. Look, in two days, I'll be escorting over two tons of coke from Puerto Rico. I've got all the details, everything you want. DEA badges says U.S., not DEA, guys. Come on. - All right. - Danny... - Sorry, Danny. - Danny? Seems like there would be less painful ways to flush out a rat. I was short on time. Besides, you hit like a little girl. Danny, wait, wait. The FBI, man, they threatened my mom. - Really? Your mom? - You got to believe me, Danny. I do believe you. Those guys are assholes. So you're gonna call the Sarge, right? I'm gonna call the Sarge. Yes, sir. First thing in the morning. Don't worry. Danny. Danny, wait. Danny. Danny, wait! Danny, wait! Danny! Danny, wait! Danny! - Really? How was it? - I'm gonna fall in the water! Danny, I'll get you impunity. You know, we are going over to the Gables tonight to pick up some chicks. I would love to, but I've been called back. What? Back to Puerto Rico? No, I'm done with Puerto Rico. I'm going back to Dominican Republic. Going back home. - Yeah. - No, come on. Hey, can I buy you a drink? Can't you see we're having a conversation here? Wasn't talking to you. How about that beer? How about I smash your face in? Whoa. You don't talk like that to a lady. - I'm talking to you, asshole. - You're talking to my asshole? Why don't you kiss it while you're down there? Manin, what the hell you been eating, man? I barely even recognized you. - Look at you. - Mami, this is... coño. Ooh, she's gone. Mierda. You haven't changed one bit. - How about that beer? - You wish, man. The Don has already put you to work. You're on duty, son. Oh, no, she's classy, son. She's from the yacht club. You don't even know. You don't even know. Bullshit. I'm not falling for that. Hand on my heart, man. She's high society all the way. You're not dating a girl from the yacht club. Allante. Well, maybe I'm more sophisticated than you think. Why don't you tell the guy, the kid, Danny? Yeah, Teo's hitting the girl from the yacht club and I'm dating a princess. You can both kiss my ass, thank you very much. Hey, Danny, where did the Don ship you in from? Puerto Rico. I've been sending shipments from there to the U.S. for the past few years. Isn't Puerto Rico where that crazy ex-marine runs things? Sarge. Sarge is in charge, right? He doesn't treat his crew like the military, does he? No booze, no women? - Only on leaves. - No shit. How long has it been since you've had some action? Oh... Your 100 years of solicitude are about to be over, my friend. - That's solitude. - Yeah, potato, tomato, whatever. You know, we're gonna drop this shipment off, and then we're gonna go see these couple of girls that I know in San Diego, man. You don't even know the breasteses on these girls. Hell yeah! Whoo! - The kid can watch the truck. - Why me? Wait. Why me? What happened to your sophisticated lady? There's only one thing wrong with her... she ain't here. That's why I keep spares. Put the gun down. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah... Oh... ♪ This love is a real love A real love ♪ ♪ A real love ♪ ♪ Grab on the wheel It's a real love ♪ - ♪ A real love ♪ - Come on. ♪ A real love ♪ Kill him. I love this song! Bring my Versace. Do you know who I am? I do. Pavo Real. Pavo Real. So... How is Don Toribio, hmm? Still old as shit? Running his business like it's the '90s, I see. Does he still drive around in that piece of shit? What was that? That was... A Chevy Impala. Does he? Huh? Oh, yeah. I bet he does. You had to see this guy, man. One of the biggest bosses in the D.R., well, at least used to be. He's driving around a busted-ass Chevy Impala? No, no. I want to show you guys something. See? Oh, my God. These were a gift from my new Mexicano associates and they were brought to me just today by my hungry friend back there. This one... I call this one El Polvo, 'cause it's white... the powder. This one I like to call El Oro... because it's, uh, gold, like fuckin' gold. You see? They're always together, never apart. 'Cause when I have powder in one hand, I have gold in the other. And when I have gold in one hand, I got powder in the other. And when I have them both in my hands, I can do whatever the fuck I want! Oh! Oh! Oh! No, no. I still need to get some bullets. Look, guys. There are too many eyes in the Pacific routes in and out of Mexico these days so the Veracruz cartel is making the D.R. their new favorite shipping stop. This is good for me. And it's bad for your boss and his Colombian clients! So tell Toribio that he can find somewhere else for his shipments, yeah? Because we're taking the beach. Come on. Come on, man. The beach is ours. Oh, my God. He speaks. Ah, you fuckers don't get it. Nothing in this piece of shit island is yours anymore, puto, nothing. Shit, you guys are lucky we even let you stay, right? You understand me, pretty boys? Feel me? All right. You guys are pretty, man. These guys are... I mean... Just look at their pretty ass hair man and some pretty little face Why don't you just... you guys are making me horny, you're so... Pretty little bitches. You know what? He's not scared away. Which one's gonna get there first, huh? Oh. Orale. 500 years of this shit. The arrangement between the Dominican gangs and their cartel clients had always been a simple one, the Dominicans provided transport, storage, and money laundering services. And the cartels paid cash. But then, the cartels changed the deal and started paying in product, cheaper for them, but for the Dominican gangs, a game changer. Danny! Don. Look at you. Miami's been good to you, huh? - Yes, sir. - Sir? The Sergeant dipshit, I guess, uh, got a few things right with you. Don Toribio. Good to see you, Danny. It's good to see you. You know the one thing that would make this whole moment better? If you hadn't lost me $2 million of my coke the minute that you got to town. Uh, actually, Don Toribio, that's why we're here. We have a plan. A plan. Sit. So, yeah. There it is. And that is your plan? Danny, vamos. So, you learned some manners from the ex-marine. Did you learn anything more useful? A thing or two. And knowing a thing or two, you're still backing Teo's plan? I'm backing Teo. I have zero confidence that Teo can pull this off, so I'm putting it on you. If you want to do this thing and back your boy, you go ahead and do it... but you better pull it off right and do not let me down again. Papa. I don't see the Mexican. Just El Pavo Real's men. - There's the heroin. - Okay. You guys wait here. Okay. - Wait, what? - I got to do something. Danny! These guys don't know how to shoot for shit. Get back to the boat, and get the shipment out of here now! There's the gofer! Take him down, now! Hell yeah! That's my boy! Don't even think about it. You don't have either in your hand. You're just shit out of luck. Come here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stop. Stop. Don't shoot. Nobody shoot. Tell your men to drop their guns. Okay. It's okay, guys. It's okay. Bring down the guns. It's okay. Bring down the guns. You're turning over the shipment to Don Toribio. Suck my dick. Oh! That didn't hurt. - Oh. Okay, okay. Stop, stop. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. - All right. All right. - We're going to give all the shipment to all Don Toribio's men, okay? I can say whatever bullshit you like, man. You won't see the morning. And your men too. Okay, and all of you men, you now work for Don Toribio. Gentlemen, welcome to your new jobs. Those of you who know of Don Toribio, you must know that he is a man of his word. Starting right now, you don't owe any allegiance to your former employer. Kill him! Kill him! Nobody move. You shouldn't have killed the kid. So... Where do you want the shipment, boss? Hey, Danny! Danny La Bala! The man, yeah! Danny. Don. Thanks. Take them off, please. Sorry. You realize that with Pavo Real gone we are in the position to be the largest organization in the country... and do you know who I have to thank for that? Teo, the strategist. He did a hell of a job, sir. Pavo's men told me what really went down. You handled yourself well, son. So now, I will gladly accept all of the new recruits and all the business that you bring to me. But... These... are not my style. So why don't you take them? Melt them down and buy a car or something. Maybe a... new Impala. Thank you, sir. It's really hard to be sad while listening to merengue, almost impossible when dancing to it. I'm here with someone. Really? With who? With that guy over there? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I can't compete with that. He's gorgeous. He's great with kids. Like a piece of chocolate wrapped in a candy shell painted the color of the worst nightmare. Oh, wow. I'm Danny. You're Danny... the Danny? Just Danny. Not even a particularly good one. Oh. A lot of competition amongst Dannys, is there? It was. Now we're unionized. Oh. We have great benefits. Well, Danny with benefits... thanks for saving my man's life. And who would be... Oh! Ohh! You're Teo's yacht club girl, right? Is that what he calls me? - Oh, wow. - I prefer Marisela. I thought he made you up. But now I have a lot of questions. - Yeah, me too. - Really? Like what? Like how the hell do you screw up so badly? You were supposed to steal the drugs from the Mexicans, you know, make them pay for what they did to you and Teo, not hand them back their product and start working for them. Listen, Marisela, I don't think Teo should be discussing this... Not with a yacht club girl? Regardless, revenge. It wasn't exactly Teo's idea. See, the idea here wasn't exactly Teo's. Baby! Hey, I see you met Danny. - Yeah. - Danny, this is her, my one and only. Merengue. Hey, what's that smell, huh? It smells like piss around here. Teo, are you gonna tell me what this is all about? She's better at this stuff than me. Patience, manin. She'll tell you all about it. - Hey, baby. - Hey, love. - Hey, you. - Hey, what's up? Hey. I want to tell you a story. Do you know the Aztecs were an empire of 5 million people? And the Incas were over twice that size. They were both taken down by an enemy that numbered in the hundreds. - She's talking about the conquistadores? - No shit. Do you know where the conquistadores based all their operations? Right here in this same building on this island. And do you know why on this island? Because this is the crossroads for all the Western world. We are right in the middle of the action, A+ access, and we keep letting it get taken away. Baby, would you mind giving us a minute? Yeah. Sure. Now, tell me, Danny, why did Toribio send you to Puerto Rico? I didn't obey orders. So you were a bad dog? Sorry, were you a good dog, then? Hmm. 'Cause make no mistake, Danny, you were a dog. And sorry, but you still are. Just like Teo, just like Toribio, just like any other member of any Dominican gang. 'Cause what is it that you guys do? You fetch drugs? You wash money and you love licking the heels of your foreign cartel members, hmm? Nothing is yours, Danny. It's all theirs. Well, not all of it. They're tossing you table scraps and the worst part of it, you go and beg for more. It's fucking depressing. Wow. You really thought through this dog analogy, didn't you? You know, I'm still working in something about sniffing assholes, but, yeah. And then you can tell me, Danny, if you're happy being a dog or if you're finally ready to bite those men in the ass. You want to talk about business? You got a problem with that? Follow me. What? Tell me. What is this really about? Daddy won't buy you a new jet or something? I just remembered... there was a Danny in my neighborhood, when I was a kid and he was always playing with my brother Jorge. They played in an alley next to a little corner shop that was always getting robbed. We used to call it, El Mercado Robado. After Danny's mother died, he ended up in the street. Then one day he stole from the wrong guys. Some older boys decided to beat the shit out of him. It wasn't going too well for Danny, this beating. But a man stepped in. Hey! An important man they called The Don. He showed up, saw what was happening and he carried poor little broken Danny off in his arms never to be seen again. So you're the scrawny little sister? Yep. So... how's Jorge? Is he good? Dead. Drugs, of course. He OD'd. I'm sorry about that. And you want to get in the drug business? If there is a way to fix it from the outside, let me know. You learn to take what you can get, Danny. Remember that. "Take what you can get." I've got the vision, Danny. It's all here. I know what needs to be done. I just need someone who can help me execute it. someone with will. I thought Teo was the guy but Teo is so not the guy. I'm thinking that could be you. - The Colombians? - They're not invited, so try to keep up. I don't think Don Toribio's gonna take the risk of getting the Colombians pissed off. It's impossible. Listen to me. Listen. Don Toribio is a dog, remember? And he thinks he's people. But you are gonna show him the way. Prove it to him. Until then, he cannot know a word, okay? We are not taking off without Don Toribio. Do you have any idea the kind of start-up money that we need? Sweetheart, that's the easiest part. - Excuse me, sir. - They're with me. Gentlemen, Dr. Cruz and Hernandez are waiting for you. This way. - Hola. - Hola. Dr. Cruz, this is Teo. After I introduced the boys to my friends, Danny introduced us to his. Danny. How are you? What'd I say? Told you you'd get sick of civvie life in about a minute. Admit it, you miss all this. Oh, I don't miss the 5am wake-ups. I kept the haircut. Sir. Don't be an asshole, son. This is Marisela. Hi. Nice to meet you. Danny.. Marisela is with Teo, actually. Well, ain't that some shit? You know the boys. Yeah. Hey. If we bring it to you, can you move it? Would you? I don't want to question your loyalty. My loyalty belongs to those who've been in the trenches with me, Danny. You know that. Men who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty, not the upper ranks who are watching their own asses. - So what do you think, Sarge? - I think what you're thinking about doing... about to piss off a lot of very powerful, very dangerous people, and if they find out about it, they won't think twice about taking your pretty little head, sweet pea. Or yours, princess. Aw, shit. Let's make some trouble. Then we have a deal. Why the hell wouldn't we? Let's get going then. - All right. - Whoo! If I asked you, what determines the price of a drug? You might say, Purity or Demand. Congratulations. You make a great consumer. For traffickers, what determines the price of a drug, is location, location, location. Buy it at the source and a kilo of coca paste will cost you about $1,000 U.S. By the time that same kilo makes it to a Colombian port, it's already worth $2,500. Once that beautiful powder makes it to the D.R., its estimated value is... Shit. What the fuck is this? Where's the coke? You're looking at it. It's not processed yet. All right, this is not all we talked about. This farm is the only place we could buy it from without Don Toribio finding out, but these guys can't process it. So we'll process it ourselves. Really? And do you know how to do that, babes? Yeah. Just leave it in the sun and let it dry? No, Teo. You don't just leave it in the sun and let it dry. Wait. Uh, hola. Uh, What do you want, Jerry? Let him in. This way. So you're the pharmacologist Creepy Tom sent? Well, no, I'm not... I'm not yet. I'm in my fourth year of my dual M.D., Ph.D. program. I mean, I... I was, but I ran out of funding, which, I mentioned that to Tom, and then, uh, I got on an airplane and I came here. I'm not really sure what this is about. - Coke. - Uh, yes, please. Oh, diet, if you have it. No, no. Not that kind of Coke. That kind of coke. Cocaine. You know? Oh. Okay, um... No, no, no, no. Guys, uh, I'm... I... I'm a student, and even so, I'm... I'm more of, uh, an analysis guy... Yeah, sure. Relax. We know that already. But you're getting your medical degree, your Ph.D. I'm pretty sure you're gonna pull this out. Yeah, I can't, uh, do this. I honestly... no, I can't, and I... I don't judge you guys, uh, for doing that. It's just that I need my tuition and, uh, this... I... I can't be... Okay, listen. This, you can take as your research semester. Right? Just a short little pause to your usual studies. Let me tell you something. When you walk out of here, when you're done, you'll have enough money to pay for every degree you could ever want. How does that sound? When it's in the D.R., that kilo is worth about 10 grand. But it's the next step, the short trip from the D.R. to Puerto Rico and past the U.S. customs where the real money gets made. It also happens to be the riskiest. Aw, shit, shit, shit. Stop! Turn off your engines! Turn off your engines! Shit, man, they're catching up to us! Go to the back. There should be two big bottles. Turn off your engines. - Salt? - Sodium! What the hell do you want me to do with this, give 'em heart disease? I don't know. It was Jerry's idea. Just lose the caps and toss them. Come on! Fuck! - Now what? - Open fire. Holy shit! And it's here, that the same kilo of coke that originally cost a grand, now goes for just over $42,000. 42 grand per kilo. That's an over 4,000% return on investment, turning this into this. And distributing it will take dozens, maybe hundreds of people. That's someone else's headache. We did this with four people, four first-timers making that kind of money in less than three months and we were just getting started. Hey, I want to tell you something. Thank you. You know, the first time I ever set foot in a place like this was with that guy right there. I was 14, you were 17. Door guy told us to get lost, but Danny pushed him and we ran inside, and we were the kings of that place for about 15 seconds, till they kicked our asses out, right? This guy... this guy's the best friend I ever had in my life. I mean it, manin. I love you, like a brother. And this girl... this girl, this girl, this girl is the girl I dreamed of my whole life. She's the kind of girl that you don't really think she exists until she's standing right in front of you. And even then, you don't know what to think. So I think it's time for me to do the right thing. Babe... will you marry me? It was the cruelest thing I ever said to anyone. Somehow I knew it but I said it anyhow. Yes. Yes. Of course. Right now a shipment of cocaine is hitting the U.S. The Mexicans and the Colombians say that it's not there, about the chemical signature or whatever. They say that it's coming from here. I said that that is not possible. Nobody would be stupid enough to risk our arrangement with the cartels. Well? Sir? Can you find these assholes and clean up this mess or not? This is your cut, Don. For everything. We wanted to prove to you it could work. It can and it has been. This is our chance, Don. Our chance to do things our way instead of being just the middle men for the cartels. There's never been a Dominican cartel before... ever. We will be the first one... and you... will be the head of it. No more taking orders, Don. 'Cause you will be your own boss. Think about it. Toribio couldn't be his own boss. A broken dog can't be his own master. He turned everything over to the Colombians. Señor Flores, I thought you'd want to see this for yourself. I'm ashamed to admit... this has been going on right underneath my own nose. What about the boat? Don Toribio sank it. He didn't want it getting recognized. - And Jerry? - Back in the states right now. Shit. Well, as far as setbacks go... Setbacks? This is not a setback. We're done. It's over. - Not necessarily. - Yeah, necessarily. - Okay, you're overreacting, Teo. - No, I'm not. You're about to be my wife, Marisela, and I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, so yeah, this is over. It's fucking over. Shit! So I guess the band is breaking up, huh? Take this off. Wait. Wait. Wait, wait. Let me go and get it. - Just a second. I'll be back. - Okay. Don't start without me, okay? All right, baby. I'm so ready. Where are you at? Oh, I asked your friend to leave. But she was very understanding about it. Is everything okay? Where's Teo? Oh, Don Toribio has him in one of those long jobs at the resort town... so I assume he's banging some blonde tourist right about now. We don't know that, right? So, uh... why are you here? Not for that. Not for what? See this? - Yes. - I'm engaged to your best friend. Yeah. I know. It doesn't matter what he does on the side. You and I are not going to do what you're thinking. - Oh, what I'm thinking? - Yeah. - No, I'm not You know, that's wrong. - Do you mind just... - Yeah, sure. - Thank you. I'm just wondering why you're still with Teo if you know he's screwing around on you. Just wondering, you know. And why are you still loyal to Don Toribio after all the time he's turned his back on you? Just wondering too. - Because I owe him. - Okay, and I owe Teo. Really? For what? It doesn't matter. We all make choices, Danny, and I chose Teo. - Yeah. - A long time ago. Anyway, I... I didn't come to talk about those choices, but the one we gave Don Toribio. It's us or the cartels. And he made his choice, remember? - Because he had one to make. - So, what are you trying to say? See, Danny, the Dominican Republic is the easy and the cheapest option for the cartels but raise the cost of doing business here, they'll pull out. And then Don Toribio will have to do things the way we've been saying. And how are we going to raise the cost? The cartels don't want Don Toribio running things anymore. They've been bringing their own people now. I assume that's got to cost something... to replace those guys. Eliminate the competition? It's a common business tactic, Danny. Drug cartels are not a common business... and we're doing this with what, you, me, and Teo? That's it? See, I don't think Teo should know about this. So it's only you and me against the most dangerous cartels in the world. - Really? - No. The most dangerous cartels in the world going against each other. And now, how to start an international gang war in three easy steps. First time holding a gun? Remember where I'm from? But have you ever killed a man? Step one, use your trafficking connections to get crews from two rival cartels in the same place at the same time. Repeat as many times as necessary. What the hell? No! - Shit! - Let's go. Step two, spark the fire. - Someone set us up. - It's got to be Toribio. - Son of a bitch! Covert ops means shit needs to stay covert. Regarding witnesses, see step three. Step three, no fucking witnesses. With every bullet, we were eliminating the competition for our new business. It was modern alchemy. We were literally turning lead... into gold. Once the war was raging, we didn't have to do a thing, the cartels were killing each other without our help. Soon, they'd take their business elsewhere and Toribio would reconsider his lack of options. All we had to do was wait for his call. - There he is. - Hey. Danny, the last time we saw each other, we, uh... Well, yeah. If you hadn't noticed, business has gotten a little slow. The old arrangements aren't working the way they used to so I thought maybe we could sit down and discuss some new ideas. Sure, Don. You know that I'm always, hey. Don't. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Get on your... Get on your knees, motherfucker. These guys want to talk about your ideas too. That's what this is about, right? You want to take the business in a fresh new direction but the old man won't let you. You're still making the wrong decisions, Don. According to who? You? That's not you talking. Where's that bitch of yours, puto? Huh? You still have a choice. I can't help you, son, not this time. Secure that building. You kill me, you're as good as dead, motherfucker. Hey, hey, hey. All clear. The Sarge to the rescue. And the girl? Partner in all this? You let her into your head and now... now she's pulling your strings. No. It's not like that. You expect me to believe all this retake the power bullshit was your idea? That's not you. No? Then what am I? You're a punk. Just a little fucking punk. Like the last-time when you ignored me and thought that you knew better and a dozen guys got killed and you ended up in Puerto Rico and that mess has still been going on for years. I would have ended it. You, ugh... you like to poke the bear. You poke and you poke and you poke and when the bear wakes up and he's pissed, you spit in his fucking face. Well, if you stop being a bear, you won't get poked. You think you can make it to my age, son? This business is a great way to get rich fast and die young. I only made it this far because I flew under the radar and I knew how to stay humble. So how's this gonna go down? He killed me so you killed him? That leaves two. Can't you say that I at least killed one so I don't go out like a total asshole? I mean... come on, Danny. You owe me something for pulling your ass out of that gutter so many years ago. Yeah. I owe you. That's why I'm gonna finish this... myself. You're a real man now. Let's go. Wrap it up. Our work here is done, gentlemen. I told you it wouldn't go as well as you thought. I bet you're glad my boys tagged along now, huh? All right, let's go, let's go. Set that scene upstairs and make me believe it. Good job, kid. Good job. Good job. Sir. Tell me it's done. Why are you the one calling me? Where's my brother? What's up? Hello. What's up? - Hey! - Hey, what's up? The freaking band is back together. Whoo! Come on. Let's go. - Yeah. - Yeah. - What's up, Jerry? - Hey, Marisela. Danny, how you doing? Good? All right. This is it, boys. Come, come. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Whoo! Who's breaking bad now, huh? You guys. You guys, this move from cocaine to heroin, this is such a smart one, right? Because, I mean, it's not the 1980s anymore.. All right, all right. Come here. Come here. Check this out. Check this out. This is the H3, all right? Smoke it. Don't shoot it. It's the black tar. It's shit but it will do the trick. It's a China white. I mean, it's not really from China, it's not really white but I'm thinking maybe we can call it Dominican beige? - I don't think so. - Okay. Fair enough. It's 90% pure. It requires a lot of time and a lot of love but it's got a huge markup. So, easy, cheap, not easy, not cheap. Which one do you guys want me to make? All three of them. - Seriously? - Yes. Take what we can get. - Uh-huh. - Right, babe? How long till we're up and running? Oh, well... well... With just me? Uh-huh. Uh, I could use a lab assistant, uh, or two with some proper training. I got you. Hmm? Properly trained enough for you? Uh, no, it's, uh, Jerry. - Jurry? - Uh, yeah. That's good. Why the hell are they dressed like that, Teo? - It's so they don't steal. - Okay. Slow down. We are gonna get up and running, right? And then we're gonna go after the rest of the guys in Veracruz for what they did to Don Toribio. - We're back in business. - Yeah! There are many caves to hide that were used a long-time ago by pirates. What's above us? You thinking Pavo Real knew about the caves? I don't know. Marcos. Did he? No. Absolutely not. I'll take it. Beautiful. No one's gonna find this cave from the ocean. We were looking for like half an hour, man. And I knew what I was looking for. Trust me. They're not gonna find this. Help up. Too shallow for the big boat. We're gonna have to load up out there. Mateo, you think you can handle this without me? One of us has to stay and one of us has to go back and one of us has to spend nearly as much time with Puerto Rican girls. If I'm not back by the morning, tell Marisela... Yeah, yeah, don't worry, bro. Got your back. Ahh! It's good! Ah. It's good! Dump it. Dump it. It all checks out. This is all ours, baby. Hey, I specifically asked you for a jewelry store or a car dealership, you know, to launder money through, not a cigar factory, Teo. And I thought you quit smoking. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Just, you know... Okay, check this out. How badass do I look now, huh? A little more badass. - Just a little bit? - Just a little. I think I look pretty badass. There. How far out are our ships? Four minutes, sir. We got the son of a bitch, finally. Yeah. Take the long way home. Got it. Wait a second. What's he doing? No, no, no. Shit. He knew about our ships. I suggest that you get your department together, major. You've got a leak. Yeah. It's as simple as that, you know? Go in the front entrance. Go. I'm gonna have to continue this some other time. I apologize. - Nice meeting you. - Same. Major. I'm a big fan of your writing. You like my text messages, huh? Bring it in. - It's good? - Yeah. Señor, till next time. Danny. Look at me, man. I'm drinking a martini and it's shaken, not stirred. I feel like James fucking Bond. Hey! Salud, to Danny! Salud! Salud to all your success, señor. You made your point. Didn't know I was making one. The other organizations operating in the D.R. are in turmoil. The fighting has weakened them. What about Veracruz? Veracruz abandoned their operation a long-time ago, right after... Right after they killed Don Toribio, right? It was smart for them to run. This is an opportunity for us. You are strong in the south and the east, we have police in the north in our pockets and control the shipping routes there. But together, we can run the entire country. Why share with the other organizations when we can just take it all? Why share when we can take it all? I like that. Mr. Flores, this is an excellent idea. Freeze, asshole! Motherfucker. Okay. Wow. What do you think? This is double the largest seizure we've ever had in the country. Huh? Well? You could lose half of it and still make the front page. Heroin, marijuana, oh, and, uh, that. We don't know if it still works but, uh, we haven't been able to get inside. You want it? Nice. Toribio's assassin and the head of the Veracruz cartel. Notice anything? They got a two-for-one rate in Shitty Tattoos R Us? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm over it. That was funny. I would not take Veracruz lightly. Veracruz is not here anymore so, you know... Hey, you think when this guy ate a bullet, his brother felt it go down? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. - Shit. - No. Cheers. Hey. We need to talk. Sure. What's up? I need an answer. You haven't asked the question. Why do you have this? That is for personal protection. - Teo, it's a dangerous world out there. - Why do you have this gun? That is not the right question. When did Danny give you this? That's better. Still not the right question. - Forget it. - No. No. Please. Ask the question. - Have you... - Been fucking Danny? Every chance I get. Teo, I think it's... You get... Teo! You... fuck. You can't blame me. You can't blame me. Not after all the women you screwed around with. You can't blame me. Maybe you had the right. But he didn't. No. No. Teo. Teo! Fuck, Teo. Hey, Teo, what's up? We need to talk about it. Not anymore. Why her? - Teo. - Huh? - Wait. Wait. - Teo, stop, stop, stop. Stop! - Answer me! - Stop! Stop. - Marisela, no! - Why her? - Stop! - No, put your gun down! This is between me and Teo. That's it. That's it. Only it's not. Is it, Manin? - Is it? Is it? - Please. You're not gonna shoot me. I know you, Teo. We're brothers. Come on. That's what I thought. You son of a bitch. I thought that too. You won't betray your brother. You never betray your brother. I guess I was wrong. We had a great thing going on here pretending to be what we're not. Put your, get your gun down. Come on. Please. I think it's time for us to know who we really are. Hey. No. Teo, no. Manin. Teo. Teo. Manin. Manin. - It's empty. - Teo. Teo. Of course, it's empty. What was I supposed to do, Danny? Just... - Danny. - Get her out of my sight. - Danny... - Get her out of my sight! Now! Danny! Danny! Come on. Come on. Get up. You're out of here. You've been pardoned. Move. Move. Mr. Flores, right here, sir. Señor Flores, sit down. We have some business to discuss. Big payday this month. And? No change. He, he won't see you. He said to tell you to stop asking. You tell him to stop being such a little bitch, all right? Yeah, I'm probably not gonna say any of that to him. - Don't touch me! - I'm sorry, ma'am. Hey. You're not inviting me in? You can't keep blaming me for what happened, Danny. Please. I'm not sure you know how blame works. That's absolutely what I can do. You know I did it for you. Don't tell me you did it for me! You did it for you! He would have never pulled that trigger. Ma'am, please. Ma'am, please. Okay? Please. Please go. Pick up the pace, Sarge. I'll see you tomorrow, son. I'll see you tomorrow. Every time we drive them away, every time we think we're finally free, the foreign masters find their way back. Oh, yeah. That's it. That's it. Hola, mayor. Remember me? Shit. What is it? The ADF... they just received a package addressed to Mayor Salcedo from Mayor Salcedo. It contained half his head. Half? Well, I'm guessing they got the left half. No, no, no, no, no. You know, what's going on is this lab coat is what's messing you up so let's take this off you. Hey! Hey! What the hell? I'm doing delicate work down here! What, is that supposed to be funny? What, is that supposed to be a joke? Ha ha! The drug enforcement task force confirms that they have received a package containing the partial remains of Colonel Samuel Salcedo, who authorities suspect was working for a drug trafficking kingpin. Diego? Damn, dude. This is the Bat Cave. Whoo! Shit. Somebody's coming! Get ready. You, lock down the cave passage. Lock down the cave. You got it. - Open! - Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. I can't let you in. You have three truckloads of hired guns coming to kill everybody. Prioritize. - Fucking open the door! - Open up. Let her in. Strap your balls back on, baby doll. We're about to have a shitty day. [gunshot Admit it, you're enjoying this. Why did you come here? Why didn't you just run when you had the chance, huh? You just think you know me, Danny. Okay. It's clear. Let's go. I need to show you something. Get ready. They're coming hot. I can't believe you kept this thing. I thought it might come in handy. Oh, my God. It did come in handy! Do you know how to drive this thing? Uh... Well, it's a good time to learn. Coming in! Oh, shit. Got your sunscreen? Yeah. You brought the beer? You stay here. Shh. I'm sorry. We never got around to getting the drugs off our streets, did we? Shit. And now this tattooed asshole gets to take over. Fuck, it's gonna be worse than ever. Marisela, listen. Listen. You can climb through those rocks and leave. Go on. I'm not leaving you, Danny. You know that. No, you're not. You're not. You're not. I'm just finishing what we started. If I don't kill this asshole, it will be up to you and I don't want to. Go. Danny! This was the way the story was always going to end. It was the only way it could. But I had to at least try, didn't I? So here we are again, with another outsider who's come to take what's ours. And another victory for them. We wanted to end the cartels' power here, once and for all. You'd think after 500 years, we were due a win but I guess why spoil the perfect streak? That's why I learned a long-time ago... take what you can get.
