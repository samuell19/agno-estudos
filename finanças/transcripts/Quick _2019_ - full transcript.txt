The man is obviously very, very sick. He should not get live among people again. I want to see her fear when she will die. I just cut and cut. The conclusion must be that my client committed the charged offense. We also have the Sater man... for the second time emptied the pond in Orjeskogen. Away. Gone forever. I admit. It was me. I wanted to see her fear. I killed every one. Dad? Dad? Dad! -And? Then the man takes the cat across the river. -Okay... Wait! He takes the dog back. Then I will take it. -No! He takes the milk back. Should I leave the doggy? Sorry. -Shit! Oh, wait. Sorry. -We try again. Thank you, thank you. Let's try again. Do not give up so easily. I speak with Hannes Rastam, the journalist? And. Do you remember the fires in Falun 75-76? No. -A dozen juvenescent people were convicted. Though they were innocent. -Yes, how do you know? I know that, for the one who lit the fires... it was me. Okay. -Check it out. Thanks. Why do you want this job? I think investigative journalism is really exciting. And very important. If I say I got an anonymous call from a potential pyroman which has avoided justice for 30 years, what do you do? Um, really exciting? -Mm... Why, we use all means as well, and... go after him. Here's the next one. -Thanks. The problem is that the case has been barred for 20 years. Yes, no, then we shit in it. -Mm. If true, then there is a bunch of 45 year olds in FALUN who took the blame as teenagers and were sentenced. They need to talk with. It says here that you read eleven hundred words a minute. Mm. For real? -Yes. Most resume begins in 19-20-year age. Your starting when you're twelve. Yes, that was when I left home. When you were twelve? -My family are Jehovah's Witnesses. Well. And? Yes, they have made me... love... the truth. In February '76. Many fires in Dalarna. Runs a pyromaniac in Falun? I certainly do not want to be with. At least two or three are... -You hear the what I say. No. Okay, so you set up on a filmed interview? Thanks. Yes! -Thanks! Great. Fine. Thank you. How is it otherwise then? Is it busy or? We should help each other and expose these liars spreading inaccuracies that Thomas Quick is innocent. Did not he is convicted of ten murders? -Eight. But if it is as you say he is guilty of the eight murders there is no journalistic achievement reveal that the judges are correct. He is guilty and lying. Thank you for this time. -They mislead the public! If I admit I have not done it, what then? "That you should not do", he said. "But if you admit that you get to go." Wait, stay here. So runs some boxes. So we put the music before. -Even earlier? Now, run. "How to go from here. Then you go home." It was as he said. And. The whole truth about Falun fires learn never arrive. But it is clear that several of the participants in reportage have recognized the fires that they never attended. And then I told Molly that I was ugly and that Sarah was foolish. But I was also stupid, but not as dumb as Sara. Why, it was perfectly fine. -It was not good at all. In addition... Quick back? -Hello? Well, you were not as stupid as Sarah, that was good? Molly is stupid. -So do not think to say. It is truth. You have said that truth is good. -Have I? Yes, I have enough. "The case of Thomas Quick depicted in all its gory details." "The most detailed description of Sweden's worst serial killer." "Quick murdered by the desire" - "and to give vent to their sadistic inclinations." "His victims, including several children, were horrific fates" - "when the psychopath and cannibal Quick hit." "A must for anyone who wants to follow in the soul's darkest paths." "A place where the border between the monsters and humans have been erased." Dad! "Quick got early diagnosis sadistic pedophile" "and judged not only be dangerous" "but sometimes danger to the safety of life and limb." This writes already in 1970. A year after he was pretty rough molested four juvenescent boys. One of them, when he was working at a hospital. No, there, take it easy. It is the examination. Do not keep doing with your hands! -Stop! And three years before he almost knife killed a man in Uppsala. But listen to this. -For the hell...! Quick was convicted of eight murders, but has admitted safely about 20 to. Before he took back his real name Sture Bergwall, and completely silent for about seven years ago. Here. Johan Asplund, eleven years. Disappeared when he was on his way to school. Pasta Stegehuis. Was stabbed to death while they were on holiday in Appojaure. Yenon Levi, juvenescent Israel. Beaten to death with a trapak. Charles Zelmanovitz. Disappeared on her way home from a school dance. And here. Therese Johannessen. In Norway. Nine years. Disappeared when she was out in the yard playing. Trine Jensen. Storvik Game. Also in Norway. Both sexual murdered. Do you understand? Different geographical locations. Various approaches. Different sex. Different ages. Different things. He must be quite unique in the world. It's absolutely incredible. How the hell could you with all this? -Worked a little at night. Interesting shit, but... And how is it possible to be convicted of murder when you do not even know that a murder has been committed? When there is not even a body. As the Johan case. There's no one who's seen him. We'll rummage a bit in this. Check around, fact-check. I'm talking with Erik. He will say no. -He will say yes. No! But if we dig into this, then nobody else to do it. Quick Case is second Palme murder the most noted of modern times. Everything is found. And all the wounds are still open. -We could work in parallel. No. -Well, then... No! I'll just take a quick look. You. Archives 4? Archives 4. Here you go. Slam the door then when you go. And? Jenny, listen here. "They then went away" "but not far, but stayed there the road was a little wider." "They took the body out of the car and Quick wore it"... Hannes. What exactly are we looking for? Receipts. I just want to see real evidence. Do you understand? I want to see that he is guilty, then we quit. Sater, department 31st Hey, it was Hannes Rastam here again from SVT. I called earlier to hear about opportunities to meet Sture Bergwall and perhaps make... Wait. He has declined all the visits and journalist talks for many years. I understand. -I can not help you. I understand. Okay. Thanks. How is the letter? -What? I thought maybe he would appreciate receiving a letter. Dear Sture. I know you since several years has turned back journalists. What I see as a very understandable choice. But I still wanted to ask the question- if it would be possible to meet you. Nothing of what we discuss will be published. I ask you only if an unconditional meeting. It is my belief that a call could be rewarding, not only for me but also for you. Sincerely, Hannes Rastam. If he went to all the small roads? For he has still taken from there to there in 50 minutes. Yes, it's... -You know what? We do it like this. Five minutes conspiracy theory. What if it's like the witness says Quick could not drive a car. As the fall prosecutor entire evidence. -Hello. Whats happening here? We, uh, working on a sequel to... pyroman document breaker. There is more to get there, then? -It's worth checking anyway. Yeah, uh... good. Josefsson, when I get to see something? You told me Wednesday, right? Thanks. -We'll see the evidence. That's it. Hello. -Hello. Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew... I think like... sausage stroganoff, perhaps? Or? Mm, it's good. Where's Emma? -Emma? Emma? Hannes? -Hey, Hannes Rastam. Where's Emma? -I have read your letter. And watched on TV your movie about Falun pyromaniac. Hell! -Seriously? You seem very serious. You can visit me at Sater for an unconditional meeting. Sincerely... Hi Emma. -Sture Bergwall. Bergenwall has thus been in and out of Sater late 70s. He sat there as he began to confess the murder. A Goran Kalberg was chief physician at the time. Late last judgment in 2001, he has no contacts outside the department. Ehm, Bergenwall now has been silent for seven years now, so... Good luck tomorrow. I strangled her. According to the chief physician to get ten minutes. Does it work as it becomes more next time. If you want to come out, press this. Then we faster than you can blink. Hello. -Sture. Hannes. -Hello. Nice. Well... Did the trip go well? -Yes. There was a lot of forest. -It's nice. The forest. I like to run in the woods. You run? -No. Uh... no. No. Should we put ourselves maybe? -Yes. Do you drink coffee? -Yes please feel free. I brought you some pastries. -Oh, what is good. Thanks. Mm. Danish pastry. Is that where this kind of shooting with it? It is a mobile phone. Is it a phone? Can I watch? -Absolutely. I have never spoken to anyone cell phone. Talk just like this? Hello Hello? Secret Army. Have you seen it? As such, Sture. You, ehh... When you came here, Gorbachev was still in power in Russia. Yes. -There was no internet. Kurt Cobain was still alive. How do you survive so long isolation? The only way to survive in here that's being incredibly rutinig. Incredibly rutinig. -What do you do during the day? Can you describe today? -Should I just tell you? Gladly. -5:29 I step up. And after morning procedures, I'm going into the kitchen 05:54, where I get my breakfast. I'm so punctual that conservationists say they can set the time for me. 6:05 I call then on another watch. To be released in the exercise yard to go for my morning walk. The walk lasts 1 hour 20 minutes. 07:25, then showers i. I usually get very sweaty. Then take my work to solve crossword puzzles at. I get many difficult crossword magazines and never leave any unsolved. Sometimes they can take days to resolve, but I solve them forever. 21.30 I go to bed and turn out the lights. And when will it be dark. "Pitch black", as they say. You are living in extremely... rigorous security arrangements. But can not you, Hannes Rastam, tell us a little about yourself? Do you have a family? -Yes. What is your day like? -Uh, yes, I... have family. Mhm. Nice. Do you have kids? -Mm. Well. Boy or girl? Uh, it's a girl. -Oh, how nice. Girls. It must be wonderful fun. -Yes that... And what's her name? Her name is Emma. -Oh. What a beautiful name. Yes it is... So there, y'all. That was it. -Okay. I do not know. He is incredibly difficult to read. He is a mentally ill person. There is no question about it. And honestly, I wheat damn what we do here then. What was his chief physician at Sater? -Kalberg? I think hell I just drove past him. Damn, damn... Goran Kalberg? -Yes it is true. Hello. Hannes Rastam. I'm... -I know, I've seen you on TV. You were the chief physician at Sater for Quick-time, right? Yes. We were left here. Would you be willing to talk to me about Thomas Quick? It is the secrecy on that. I just met Sture. -Yes? How is he? -I do not know. It's hard for me to judge. -Yes. It is difficult for everyone. Good luck. If Bergenwall solve you from the privacy, you can talk then? I feel great loyalty to Saters forensic psychiatric clinic. But I do not want to be involved in the cover-up of a legal scandal. Kalberg talking about a legal scandal, but there is forensic evidence. The bones from Therese case. Quick pointed out the location in Norway. We're talking about pieces of bone from a child, Hannes. Here... I can tell you that the techniques found bone fragments, from the very place that Thomas Quick pointed out. And it says the prosecutor himself. And in this piece of bone found a notch from a saw. On the site they found even a hacksaw blades that fit into the groove. Yes but then so. There we have the evidence. Good. Good. Is it possible to get that piece of bone, do you? It's quite impossible, but... this is the right damning, it must be said. What the hell are we doing? -He is convicted of eight murders, Hannes. Full sick murder. Gry Storvik, Oslo. Raped and... You look. Total damaged. Hi. Are you lonely tonight? Do you want company? Do you have a place we can go to? You do not say much. Sture, you've recognized numerous murders. And sentenced to eight of them. If you stand firm in these confessions still? Confessions stands, yes. It does. It's done. I wonder, what would happen if you had to stay free in the community? Would you kill and desecrate a child again? No, no, no. It would not do. What would happen if you, let's say you got to live frit under some countenance course? Doctors believe that I have to be held within forensic psychiatric care. I've heard what they say. Now I ask you. You still seems to be a fairly normal person. You think? -Yes. Sensible. How fun. And it would not be, you mean? No. You are regarded as the most dangerous of Sweden and craziest psycho. Already. Mons. Can... Well, I wanted to... just get an old cookie jar with some pictures... I thought you might have some interest in seeing. Yes please. It is, above all, uh, my twin sister. Here's Gun. And she is completely normal. She's not a psycho. -Where is the gun. Here is a picture of me when I... I was pretty cute as children. -Let's see. How old are you here then? -Ehh, three. Look here. And this was a bit embarrassing. -Why was it embarrassing? This woman is the only woman I ever had sex with. The yet? It was during one period. I had a hope that... to live together with a woman, and perhaps have children. Look here. Here is Patrick and I am on my way home from Iron Maiden in the Globe. Can I borrow some of your photos? You'll get them back. -I'll probably be happy picture of Lina... Eventually, maybe we should start filming our meetings, too? If you think it's okay. Answer: yes. This is the only woman Sture ever had sex with. According to him yourself. What then? -Exactly. It is not Gry Storvik. How often do gay pedophile, rape and kill adult women? He gush out, mind you, or? -Yes or... Or so he tried to manipulate me somehow. What the hell? Is Sture Bergwall who has lit the Falun? There is only one thing we check in. -It is indeed my responsibility. Really. One of Sweden's most publicized mass murderers. The prosecutor... van der Kwast. He has gotten him convicted of ten murders. Eight. And it's all wrong? -It is absolutely not what we say. But that's what you think. -We look at the evidence. How many families settled down to a madman murdered their loved ones? It affects hundreds of people. Do you understand what that would mean? Look at my face. -I'm looking at your face. What do you see? -One senses a certain reluctance. It's a big fucking doubt. It's pretty simple. Either lying Bergenwall or so he speaks the truth. He speaks the truth, we have nothing. If he does not, then bastards. Then it's the scoop of the decade. -Yes, something like that. Damn. It's Eve. She sits down in a taxi waiting. We are going to the Royal Dramatic Theater. I'm also hesitant. It can be seen quite clearly. -Thank you, thank you for that. Okay, dammit. But I want to have concrete evidence. Bloody fucking solid. You should be able to build my new house for them. Does it sound good? Sounds great. Yes I am coming. It begins eight. Bloody fucking solid. He should be able to build their new houses on them. We need to get hold of someone who was on Sater from beginning. Before Sture began to admit murder. Where do we find such a time? Mia Ekberg? -And. Hannes. Yes, anonymously. -Absolutely. Is it okay if I write down a little? -Sure. Yes. You worked as a caregiver in Sater? -Yes. Well, I was there from, uh... from '91. Sture come back a few months later, then. After which the bank robbery, you know. -Mm. He was down. Almost completely apathetic. Are you okay? -No, I feel bad. Try to rest for a while. I think Sture was the loneliest man I ever met. He needed the someone to talk to. And then came the time... well, Birgitta Stahle to Sater. And... Margit Norell then, of course. Dear colleagues. With great reverence I give now the word, the creator of Holistic compound. The woman who for years had its lead in mental development. The woman who created methods, to penetrate deeper into man's innermost secrets. Everyone's our guiding principle and teachers: Margit Norell! Thanks for the nice words, Bridget. Then I want to get straight to the point. What we know, friends, that's... that man unconsciously categorize second people, in light of previous relationships. And think of what that means in practice. Personality disorders can be explained by object relational theory. As to the human ability to find suitable representations and thus establish durable relations are disturbed... since all subsequent relationships aimed back at the mother. The adult violent crime is almost always re-configurations of the abuse he suffered during childhood. And many years of experience in object relations has taught me in the quietest water swims the biggest fish. And... the sickest. Those who most need our help. And then what happened? -Yes... Sture nag if he wants to "talk to itself", he says. Nothing hurts Sture, he just needs a friend. Are there any of you who have time to be Sture's friend? We got along well, and I Sture. I think he... liked me. As a friend, that is. -Mm, of course. I wonder what you would think of me, if you found out that I have done something really, really rough. What, then, roughly? I can give you... a clue. Okay. M... U. Him? -Yes. I met an old friend of yours. Mia, who worked here. Fine Mia! -Do you remember Mia? She was actually one of the nicest people I ever met. She said you had... started telling terrible things you might have done for her. And then she talked about Margit Norell. -She did? So, Margaret, she... She was like a mother. Everyone's mother. Bridget and Margaret have actually written a book together. About me. -A book? What kind of book? Well, it was thought that it would revolutionize psychiatry. It was a follow up to Freud's case study on the Wolfman, they said. It was never published. I do not know why. But I found a copy of my room when I was cleaning the other day. Holy shit! Hello. Sorry, I forgot the phone. -Norell has written a book about Sture. Oh, fuck. -Yes that's true. "She's incredible." "Can you imagine? She has written a book about me." And where is it then? Right here in front of me... Hello? That's more like it is in your hand. You see that I can move the thumb, but there is more here... Hello. How are you? -Well, that was the one fucking bang. But it seems to have gone well anyway. Someone said I did not need... Because I would really like the night, but it would be great if I did not, because I have stuff to do... We would like to X-Ray you first. We found something on CT... we'll investigate further. Not related to the accident to do. A piece of tissue that should not be there. Yes? -Soon someone will help you. I see a new documentary every week about people who survive cancer. Cancer of the media and the reality is sadly different things. Yes Yes. But if you were to give you a guess... If it is there is a suspicion... it can be difficult to operate. -Okay. And then we look at alternative methods of treatment. And I want to be totally honest. Only where it is... If it has spread, it will not be cured completely. Hei, Emma. It's Dad. How are you? Good. Are you coming home? ?No, not today. I'm sorry I miss football. I would need... Help! Help! Do not you remember... -What do you do anything? You are so strange little finger. -No. Yes! -No! It is normal. -Completely normal? Emma! -It's ugly! It is not! -Emma? You can talk to mom. -No, I want to talk to you. The woman, now you listen to me. Well, what the hell, Hannes? I was a little distracted only. I ought to have been a little better track. I hope they checked thoroughly. -Yes. It is quiet. I could not just take the train home. So thanks for this. Well, it is well obvious. Well. Tell us a little about yourself then. About myself? There is not much more than what you see. When were you happy later? That was when you hired me. Damn! -What then? And you? Today, when I was talking to my daughter on the phone. It... it was fine. Look, the money we make, what we're doing... It must be important. Of course. -What is important to you? It is the truth. When we go there. We'll do that. But first... my favorite dish. Vegetable gratin! The first stab open the trunk and then the right leg off. The patient returned portray here. He tries to repair Simon. Sture? You know Mia who works here? Do you remember the conversation you had with her down at the beach? And...? Oh, yeah, yeah. What does it mean "MU"? "MU." -Yes... It was because I have... may have been guilty of some terrible things. Some memories have surfaced. -Good. Tell us about the memories. I have... weak memories of a drive. A drive? -For Sundsvall. I have memories of blood. -Blood? And a little boy. -Boy? A small boy. As I think said his name was John. And "MU"? What does it mean? Yes, it has to do with this. Sture? -"Murder". What...? -"Murder." Have you murdered someone? Did you kill John? -It's what I do not know. Sture? Gone forever. Gone forever. -Calm, Sture. Hello, baby face. "Cliff" are talking English, although Sture not. And it's not at all unusual that the alternative identity, in the body of a person speaking a foreign language. I like the feeling of your deadline! But it's Ellington growls? -Yes. Sture. -Calm, Sture. No! No! Not the neck, Mom! Not Simon! While they abused him sexually, slaughtered mother and father Sture's little brother's fetus Simon and forced then Sture eating part of him. Sture again portray here. He has internalized their terrifying experiences. It is quite amazing that he has begun to remember. The adult violent crime is almost always re-configurations, of the abuse he suffered during childhood. Christer van der Kwast was nobody to Johan Asplund case. When he hears that a crazy man on Sater talked about Johan Asplund murder. What has he said? And shortly thereafter, he created... -Sater man. Pointed out places where he has hidden Johan Asplund body parts. Technicians are currently looking for hands outside Falun. We hope and believe that this disappearance a speedy solution, and that John's parents get answers. But his parents never thought that Quick was behind the disappearance. We sit never complacent to Sture Bergwall murdered our son. The truth lies elsewhere. We have told all and the police. We have been saying for Christer van der Kwast. But no body was found. That we have not found anything does not mean that there is anything to find. Blomgren. We also have the Sater man served information, if he in 1964 as a 14 age murdered the same age Thomas Blomgren in Vaxjo. What do John's parents? -Is there a serial killer? Sture was able to describe in detail the location where Thomas Blomgren was murdered. Seppo Penttinen was van der Kwasts faithful squire. Sture, you can try to show approximately where you were in the morning? We will of course ride from the south, as I remember it... Just so I understand what you say... You were not alone? -No. So you killed with a friend? Who was it? A gentleman named Sixten Eliasson. It was he who drove the car. Sture's alleged co-defendant was not followed up properly. The bones of Therese case is thus the only forensic evidence. But maybe it's time for you to take a trip to Norway. Police in Drammen videotaped all flashes with Quick in Therese case. You can borrow cassettes for 24 hours if they do not leave the country. So... it gets First Hotel Ambassadeur in Drammen. I have ordered late checkout. How's it going, Sture? Do you get in your medicine? Do you want some water? -No, I... I have Coke. Is he sleeping? Can you bring... Touch something, Thomas? Is that something you see? It was there where I did not want to see! What did not you see? -No, it was an uprooted tree! Called! Come and help me. Help me! "Nomis"? What is it, Thomas? Do you recognize yourself? I can not tell you where to turn, I can only point. Can you point to where to turn then? -Then we turn right, next. Did I say that? -Yes, you said it right, Thomas. Okay. -You are really good now. Heart and stomach and kidney... -Do you recognize yourself, Thomas? Sture? Is this you killed her? Yes, yes. The spine is spjucklig somehow. Sven-Ake, what the hell is he saying? Go into memory when you kill her. You know... -Pig motherfucker! Take it easy now, Sture! Thomas, Thomas! Thomas! Where have you hidden Therese? Gone forever. -Is that you, Ellington? Through the initial regression may Sture contact with the event. Thus, we can also produce a full recollection of the event. Were did you body, Thomas? Here. -Is this the place? Search your hidden memories. -Do you get anxiety when you see the pond? I have in the difficult, the... Can we break now? -Yes, we take a break. -Borgstrom. Sture is thus at one point completely massacred body. I open Therese then with a knife. Then he swam out in the middle of the pond and let the body parts there. Good. -Talk as we understand. This is the fear. -The lake is the fear? Do you see the place? Was it here? You dumped her in the lake? What about Norway? ?Norway! Norway. What is this thing? It was on your table. What is that? Are you sick? Of course you can not be. Right? Then you would of course have told you in this case. You should have told your wife and your daughter, right? It's the kind of thing you do. They talk to each other. Are you going to die? What? -Why, add now. But say something, Hannes. Say something. Sorry. You dropped out of the investigation. -Yes I did. Why? Because it was a pure farce. For me it's quite simple. If the investigation could present a single concrete tangible evidence to Sture Bergwall has done what he has recognized, I would possibly shut up... He could point out the place where Gry Storvik murdered. He knew stab placement in Appojaure. And we have that piece of Therese case. But take these hides to human body parts that he's talking about. Why have you never found them? And one more thing you should check... It is about Sture Bergwall ever left a single task either that the police do not have already known. Oh, what work you put into it! You have been in Norway... Honestly, I have to say that the trip to Norway and all that I saw there made me very... think. Yes? -I saw the police video footage. You got a lot of drugs, right? During flushes it seemed extremely affected. Honestly, you behaved as though you've never been to the site. Sture, you can understand that this is what I see when I look at the video? If that's the way it is... I have not been guilty of any of all these murders... What should I do? If you are not guilty, Sture, you have the chance of a lifetime now. All here think they know that I owe. Six different courts have judged me guilty of eight murders. I know that. But if you're innocent, and is willing to tell the truth does all that other not matter. I think we break here now. It's Sture. This is Hannes. I just hear how it felt after our meeting today. Well, uh... So, it feels good. How do you feel? -I? A few days ago my colleague asked me if I was happy at the latest. And I said that was when I was talking to my daughter. They usually say so. And I mean, I love her and everything like that, it's not... It's just so rare I really there with her the whole me. I mean, I... I think otherwise. And when you're happy? Just do not. Sture, I'm left in Sater. Can I come and see you tomorrow? You know, you're so welcome. Bye. Sture? You've said that you have committed 30 murders. And. But there are no witnesses, no DNA, no forensic evidence. How is that possible? You've talked about your parents' sexual abuse. How to... forced to eat parts of your brother Simon fetus. All of this should have been done without the rest of the family noticed something. Who is lying? I have not committed any of the murders I'm found guilty pre and not some of the others I recognized either. That's how it is. But why, Sture? Why did you do then? The... I actually wondered myself. When I came here after the bank robbery, I had no contact with my family. And I felt totally useless. I had long vurmat of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, especially. I would just like to inform you that... I've thought about taking my own life. Can you tell that to the therapists there? And the first blow, it takes in the trunk... I realized this on Sater you have to pick up horrible memories. Mom takes a piece of meat and put in my mouth. And I say, "No, Mom! Mom, I'm not hjuvenescentry!" Sture again portray here. -And the bone breaks. He wants to repair her little brother Simon, through the body parts he saves from the people he has killed. I try to take Simon's place. I take his hand and discovers... that the hand is off. And that's what all this is about killing. Little boy. It is quite amazing that he has begun to remember now. But it is very logical, Bridget. So difficult things hidden away. The child is trying to survive. That's how it is. And now he needs your help to sort all this chaos. Thanks. Good day, Sture. -Hi. Hey. I so want to introduce to you a very good friend. Sven-Ake Christianson. And he works for the police. Hey, Sture. -Hello Hello. How nice to finally meet you. I'll help you remember things that you probably repressed. I often help the police with that. He's just fine on it. -How nice. It's kind of funny. You and I are almost as old. Oh, really? -I have been a visiting scholar in the United States. No? And there we have something called the "serial killer". Oops. It does not sound good. And a famous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is. And... he's not unlike you. May I ask you... How do you think he felt when he dismembered his victims? I would say that the primary feeling was, uh... colossal... swoon. Extremely interesting. Great, Sture. We'll talk about this. I look forward to it. As soon as I started looking at the memories when I got the incredible response. Sture feel very bad. -He should get more Xanax if he wants. And this with the room... Thus, an incredible response. -In which way? In the form of therapy and medication. -What kind of medication? Above all benzodiazepines. Xanax. -Benzo? I got a bigger room even. Birgitta? Can you sit down? And it was that way. The more I could tell, the more benzo I could get. And the more benzo I could have the more uninhibited, I could be in my narrative. Hello, Sture. Why, hello. Hi. Well... What are you sitting and writing on today? I have started to write a small text that might be a book about all the terrible things that have happened. Yeah, but what fun. I have actually thought about writing a book about this. You, uh, I've talked to Margaret and Bridget. And they said you might want to talk... a little boy. I do not want to do it. I would however be happy to share information on a journey that went to Norway, where I can have... kidnapped, raped, murdered and dismembered a girl. A girl? -Mm. It was a little unexpectedly, I must say. Why did you confess? -Doctors strangled medication. It was just before Asplund judgment. Take it from the beginning. Tell us about the therapy. I'll kill Thomas! It was a colossal pressure from the therapists that I could tell. Sture, was the Cliff or Ellington killed Yenon? Sture! Where the Cliff or Ellington killed Yenon? I was like this and shook... Have you seen when detoxified? So when Ellington takes shape and trying but fail to take back his power then it is the first time in his life as Sture will experience objektkonstans. Yes, it's extremely interesting. We're supposed to remember that the only period of security as Sture felt with her mother must have been in the womb. But there was also the twin sister Gun. She could be the mother bond with. But never to Sture. Never. I think she wanted him dead. -Yes. Little boy. You can turn it off there. -I'm all sweaty. It would be very valuable for me to take part of your medical records. But... no, do not think I want to. -Why not? It feels so terribly embarrassed to let anyone outside to take part of everything I have said and done during all these years. Everyone has read about murdered children and eating their bodies. What can reasonably be maintained that may be embarrassing for you? The whole thing is so embarrassing it can be. Why, I... -No, Sture. No. You know what? Two rules if you want me to continue with this. (1) Never lie to me. From now on, you speak always the truth. Do you understand? Yes. Yes. (2) I have to get a warrant. Do we agree? -Yes of course. Bro. Here. Take this. But hide it in a safe place. -Sure. No. I have put in floor heating, but then I read precis to have high temperature slab can absorb moisture from the ground. So now you must not be so high. One should not raise and lower, the difference in temperature can... Can you stay here? -What, here? Kalberg! I tried calling you. -I know. Do not you talk to me or? -No. Just one question, one last question. I've read the records. It seems to coincide in time to Sture medication strangle and he ended admit murder. Is that correct or? I discovered that Sture had been given too much medicine for too long. So I strangled the flow. -And then he stopped talking? And. What are you thinking about it? -I'm thinking a lot about it. But it rang no bells, then? -It rang all sorts of bells. But you let them call? You did not think you'd do anything? Maybe you thought it was right for him? That he could sit there? That it was part of the "integration" of Sater? Was it so? But why did you do nothing? I checked the possibility of requesting stature. You did? -Yes. But they said it was impossible. So, good luck. -Can you say this on film? On the positive side we see VI your body to tolerate chemotherapy. How much time do I have left? One year? Half a year? It's a question we often hear. We tend not to enter anyone exact time because it is extremely individual. And... we want to focus on the quality of your life. Sture has withdrawn its recognition. And I've got all his records. Find someone who can make this understandable. How's it going with the bones? Kwast rejects independent experts. -They need us well? But... -Without them we will not further notice. Piece of bone can be all the difference on the Swedish justice has sentenced a mental case man for eight murders he did not commit! Or if we're on the bikes. -Mm, I know, thank you. Why do you say things to me that I already know? What is this something? Sorry. -Mm. Hearing Minutes from Therese-case. Quite interesting reading. In connection with the waxing as you mention a task either if some form of scarring at Therese, on her arm. Or arms. I do not really remember. Can you expand on that, it's good. No. I do not know... A skin condition? A blotchy...? -As a blotchy? And. But you... Now I see the expression on your face that evokes a memory. You're really good, Sture. Yes. You see, the only leading questions. But wait, I hope that we mean the same thing with a "blotchy". Is it that she has a disease? Or is it a natural patchiness at the moment? It can be a patchy at the moment. But it may be something she has. I remember it as a distinct mottling. Now show you on top of your arm. Is that where you see it? -Yes. And here. Sture's lawyer says thus not a word. Therese, as I said a blond girl. She has pink sweatpants. She has large front teeth. And she goes on the grass when I catch her. In the grass? -I see a lot of grass in front of me. How do the houses look like? -It is usual house. Big house, small...? -Single-family houses, villas and... Now we have been talking a lot about conscious deviations. Could it be wrong to just today talking about the girl of appearance for this reason? And. -Mm. Do you have any comment on the judgment? The conclusion must be that my client committed the charged offense. Are you going to appeal? -There will I take with my client. But it is hardly likely. It says one who gets paid with government money to help Sture. May I ask what your angle is? From the beginning I had no angle, but I have admit that the more I read of the investigation, the more skeptical I become. How much time have you spent on this? A few months. -Not full time, then? Yes. And with some help. Mhm. Taxi Stockholm. Why did Thomas Quick to Therese Johannessen, had pink sweatpants wearing when she disappeared? And headbands and... patent leather shoes and... large front teeth. Yes... Yes, it... The... Excuse me, we... Could we take a break? What are you doing? -Sture records. A pharmacology professor said that someone with such a dose benzodiazepines, not at all can relate to the world in an effective way. Bra. Did you know that Sture Bergwall abused drug medications, so-called benzodiazepines during the investigation? I am not speaking about it so. I know he has an abuse problem behind. But not when he was on Sater. -Yes, he had. On Sater called it the "as-needed medication." So he could freely browse among all kinds of... I do not accept that proposition. -Sorry? I do not accept the claim. -You do not accept...? It is head of the physician. It is not my contention. And I do not accept the claim. -No... A piece of tissue that should not be there. Okay, we go back to Therese case. You said... That he changed his mind. -Exactly. And got more and more right. But after 20 months, he maintained that Therese had a hair band. So it can be sometimes. -It can be so? So it can be sometimes. -Okay. Your former client Thomas Quick has withdrawn all his confessions. And now claims that he is innocent. -Yeah. If you claim that police and psychologists, rigged and manipulated the courts to convict an innocent, I say that it has never occurred in Swedish legal history. No. And what's to say that he is telling the truth now? I do not know. It's as if... We have come too close to each other. Do you understand? It is as if he has become my best friend or something. Is that so? Is Sture Bergwall my best friend? But what the hell, Hannes... Sure, why not? He wants so much to please. He wants to be good, he wants to help me, he would... He wants to fit in where he is, for example, Sater. He is so incredibly I-weak and easily led. If through his lawyer says he's guilty then he is well there. Sadly approach, I think. Yes, but perhaps it is the truth. Do you remember that? The truth? Mm. You seem hesitant. I don't know what to believe. -Do you remember the married couple Stegehuis? You know the ones... became knife murdered in his tent. And. I come from this direction. There, Jonny takes over. So I take back the knife. Thomas. -Where, then! No, no! -Cut it out. What the hell... Help for this now! -Thomas! Pull him back! -Thomas! Sture came back. -Hold on there. Can I talk to Sture? Ellington? -Now we break. Yes, it was a colossal depression. Really. It is essential that we optimize conditions, so that he can access the hidden memories. Sture, go into feeling how it is to be a murderer. Feel how it feels to hold the knife and stabbed award. This way, you can access your memories. Should we try it? Sture, it may be that you were approaching your tent from anything elsewhere? Then I would like to say right. But in the current situation I do think it was left. Good, Sture. -Should we try again then? No, it was a real fucking circus. In this investigation tolerated not that anyone thought differently. Then they went out. It was like a fucking sect. And I still have not told you the worst. Levi. He was like those found on a forest road in the pipe foundry. There was another suspect, but the evidence against him, they conjured away. And at this point is the Israelite then unconscious. But I still lift him out in this way. So. And so for safety's sake, pounding my head so... toward the car. Jeez, what heavy! So. And now I would like to know the jack and a stone. Thanks. So. And now I have a memory of a knife. A knife? As I right now can not be put in context. Then I take as Jack... there! He sits up. And at this stage, I decide when to feed a kick. So! Now we reset. Completely reset. Now just focus on Yenon Levi. Feel the nature, scents and rustling leaves... Do you recognize anything on the ground of vedstruktur or wood? Yes, yes, yes. Well, now I'm making you so. It was like... Or that... You see something that length basis consistent with that which you... That was it. So. It is crystal-clear to me now. Can we break now? -Great, Sture. How's it going with the bones? -Well, I'm working on it. Good. -To you, Jenny. Oh, shit. From Sture's sister. She and Sture was confirmed the same day that Thomas Blomgren was murdered. Weekend of Pentecost, in 1964. Two days folk dance, party, witnesses... photographs. 50 mil from Blomgren. Stronger alibi is not true. This, she said to the police, but they never followed up on it. Well, they followed it up, it was just... Seppo Penttinen followed it up, but they never found the site. You? What place? -The place where the, uh... The place where they were... Eh... Ehh... What the hell have I... Sture had just said that... He had said that she had hair band and large front teeth. Are you going to die? -We found something. You should have told me. -I told it to him. To whom? -To whom? To whom?! What? -Ehh... Why did not you say anything? You do things carefully, Hannes. When you are working, then bastards are you. So when you get cancer, you will not get the crap cancer whatsoever. Who knows? Family. Emma wondering who to go with her to the football now that I will... These damn doctors know nothing. They just guessing. There are people with my diagnosis, living in three months. And then there are those who... will survive until they die a natural death. There is no point in speculating about it. Help me out of here now. When was your life like best, Sture? Yes, I would probably say that it was in Grycksbo. Grycksbo years was the best time. -Why? I was sober for the first time in 15 years. I could, for example, celebrate Christmas with my friend Patrick and his family. What is this? Amen, a cardigan? And the ladies in the bingo hall was very fond of me. 46.?? Four, six. But it did not end so well? -No. Take it easy, Patrick, goddamn it! Take it easy! It ended in a terrible tragedy. -With the robbery? Fix the keys to the vault! Go to the bank and get the money! I will stay here and I'll kill every one of your family, if you come back with money! Is that you, Sture? Satan the devil! And that's what brought you here? -Yes, it was very stupid. Murder Trials, Sture. Can you tell us about the trials? It was a nightmare. It was a horrendous period. Quick raped by her father from the age of four. He was robbed of his childhood, and can not stand the fear. He thinks he can ruin a life, thus recreating their own. But the relief is short-lived. He has to kill again. The difficulty was that the memory images of the killings have been fragmentary and that sometimes it took... You said earlier that you are attracted Yenon Levi into the car. But how could you with your limited language skills to communicate with him? For then I Cliff and he speaks excellent English. Hello, baby face! Early in therapy came Simon incident during a deep regression. It was Thomas greatest desire to get back his little brother. To "fix Simon", he says. The man is a serial killer, pedophile, necrophiliac... Johan Asplund's mother. We have been able to establish that the burned fragments, likely from a man, probably a juvenescent person. I fully behind my colleague Professor Helmer in the case. Can we take a break soon? -Soon. One thing, Sture, I've been thinking about for a long time... What did you do on your home leave in Stockholm? Then I went to KB. Excuse me. Do you know where the microfilm room is? Royal Library in Stockholm. And cranked microfilm. If...? -The murder of Thomas Blomgren course. For where I could the strength of my own story. By finding photographs of the shed where Thomas killed, I could draw them and appear credible. It was time-barred and secure and so I could get more benzo. You are welcome. -Thanks. I'm thinking about actually being renamed. Rename? Quick. What do you say about that? It was my mother's maiden name. -Sture... Quick. No no. Thomas Quick. Thomas? As your first victim? In Zelmanovitz case then it was a hunter who found the remains of the body. But how could you show the police there? I could not, but it was Sven-Ake Christianson as... We trained here on Sater. -Trained? How, then, trained? Nine, ten, eleven. Stop! And then you turn to the left. Good. Know that you carry on Charles's body. One, Two, Three... Four, five, six... As I understand it, Sture, so you had an alibi for Johan Asplund case. How did you get the information? -It was a very talked about case. In November 1980, disappeared eleven-year-old Johan Asplund from this house. In another furlough I fixed a map of Sundsvall. Then I also take note of the preliminary investigation before the trial. How could you know anything about the clothes? It was from a book that I read about the case. As I actually got a journalist from Dala-Democrat. Old Man Jan? Old Man January Stigson? -So was his name. Lars, we break there. Give us two minutes, please. What were you thinking, Sture, when the police emptied the lake there in Norway? I was not thinking so much. I wanted to give the police something to work with. They had not found anything. And if they then had to empty a lake so maybe they'd be happy. Were they happy then? -If they were, they were very happy. They emptied the lake twice. That was one of the most costly police operations in Scandinavia ever. They pumped up the 35 million liters of water and filtered it. They came down to 10000 years old deposits down in the bottom sediment. But they found nothing, and then I simply blame loading that the reason was conscious deviations. And then said that I had fired up Therese. When did van der Kwast suddenly something. I can tell you that the techniques found bone fragments from the very instead which Thomas Quick pekat out. There was joy everywhere here in Sater and I got lot of medicines. And how do you explain where the burnt bones were then? Yes, I can not. No. Sture, your new lawyer's good. He is really good. He has submitted an application for revision now. How it goes with it, nobody knows. -That's really good! I am so incredibly grateful. I want you to help him. One more thing, Sture. I am sick. I have cancer. In the pancreas, so... So you and I will just have to hope for the best. But... what are you saying? I wrote a letter to Thomas Quick. Although he talked with journalists in years. How can it be that you are in investigation time... Allow Quick clearance and parole... even though he was suspected of murdering several juvenescent boys? Clearly you can not find it understandable. But the question is in the ground if it is correct. Are there any other aspects of the topic? It is what it is. Remember that you are interested in what Sture Bergwall made their parole? I do not remember. If I say that he was sitting at a library in Stockholm. In the newspaper division. -Yeah. And read what? If Thomas Blomgren, among others. He sat there and locked himself in the murder of Thomas Blomgren. It is so Sture Bergwall has withdrawn its recognition. Well. Then he well do it then. It was a surprising news to me. He would not have done anything? -No. Anyone who can prove it has found the world's largest SCOOP... When it comes to manipulating justice. Obviously, I say without trembling voice, that it is not. Now it is 2008. He sits there. He will never be released, whether he is claiming the revision or not. I have not committed any of the murders I am found guilty of. And not a few of the others I recognized either. That's how it is. Thomas Quick, one of our worst mass killer, or perhaps one of our greatest legal scandals. It is not established that there was a legal scandal. It is the prelude to the greatest scandal in Swedish legal history. Eight murder erroneous judgments. It is unique in our legal history. What's your comment? -Is there a legal scandal, Chris? Did you know that Bergenwall recanted their confessions? I, like everyone else, saw Hannes Rastam documentary last night. And the chief prosecutor in the Quick Inquiry I must say that it is... cleverly made. But unfortunately it does not tell the truth. Thomas Quick, now Sture Bergwall is not wrongly convicted. No legal scandal occurred. Evidence against Bergenwall are solid. It is enough to point to the remains, the bones after Therese Johannessen. Where medical expertise, not I held beyond a reasonable doubt that they are genuine. Time will give me the right. Thanks so much. Thanks. Rock, Paper, Scissors. ?Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors. ?Rock, Paper, Scissors. Gosh! Rock, Paper, Scissors. ?Rock, Paper, Scissors. A last time. Rock, Paper, Scissors. ?Rock, Paper, Scissors. Molly's father is also dead. Though she notice it only on Saturdays. So... Now I am still not quite dead yet, right? They used to be with each other. They watched movies and ate sweets and drank soda. But now do not go there anymore. But, you... Molly might be able to do it with her mother instead. She is boring. Not like you, then, mother. Ouch. Well, then it's not easy. Hey, it's Jenny. When then? The experts said that this was the bones of a child, can only have looked and guessed. What is it then? How is it going? -I think they will win. Good work. And how are you then? Today I feel fine. Are you working with something exciting? It is well done. -Can I read? You get to read when I'm finished. You must hurry. I see how the candles burn out I see how every life comes to an end the radiating flares who called us ends they burn all out I see how life drains away the time is always too short the endless path who would become my life ends will also come to an end Thank you, Anette. -Good luck now. Hello. -Hello. And your name is...? Conrad. -With C or K? C, please. -With C. Yes, come, little man. Yes. No, Seppo, not there. Subs: NKMD ROADS
