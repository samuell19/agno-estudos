That piece doesn't seem to fit. Why don't you try this one, Yingying? What's supposed to be under the petals? Flowers are like people. They need water and nutrients to bloom. Don't rush it, Yingying. Yuan Mansion. Phone call for you, ma'am. It's the police. We promised not to lose our temper. Our development of-- What? Ma'am. Yiming. What's wrong, Yiming? See you tomorrow. Dad. LAPD confirmed that all three suspects had been shot dead. They appeared to have a direct connection to at least nine kidnap cases in the past decade. Direct connection? So they were the culprits? The official report is not yet released. But the probability is 90 percent. What do you mean "official," "90 percent"? -Were they the ones or not? -Mom, let Inspector Deng-- Your entire family moved to LA 12 years ago. -You stayed there for two years. Correct? -My company opened a branch there. We relocated. Your younger daughter, Cherry Yuan, was she kidnapped four months after your arrival? Yes, my sister was eight. Back then, Cherry was kidnapped and killed. The LA cops came up with nothing in two years. Now you tell me they've killed the kidnappers. What's the point? Cherry is still dead. This is a DNA report from the States. They found a girl in the crime scene's basement. The test shows... it's your daughter. Cherry Yuan. She's still alive. What's taking so long? Is something wrong? Inspector Deng just texted. The paperwork is done. They're on their way. All you know is crying. Even when it's a happy occasion. Happy? I told you ten years ago, Cherry had to be alive. Who gave up the search and moved us back to Hong Kong? Who lost her in the first place? Was it me? Dad. Mr. and Mrs. Yuan. Cherry. Don't be afraid. It's safe here. I'm your sister. Dad. Mom. Cherry, you're home. You can go early today, Ho. Yes, sir. Miss Yuan. Please relay to your parents, we will need a statement from you sister. Give her a little time, okay? It was a long flight. You must be tired. Get a good night's sleep. Do you think-- she no longer remembers us? Take it slow. Don't rush it. Cherry was so young back then. Given time, she will recall everything. Cherry is so smart. What a good job. Tulip. Ma'am. Mr. Yuan is on the phone. Cai, get some liver from Ranch market. I'm cooking. Yes, ma'am. You look pale. Forgot your insulin again? -No. -Hello? We were in the yard. What a mess. Surely your brother can take care of it in Hong Kong. Are we to support him for nothing? All right. We won't wait up. Didn't I tell you not to drink from the bottle, Jing? Where's Cherry? You left her outside alone? What kind of a sister are you? Cherry? Cherry. Cherry. Cherry! I'll look that way. Cherry! Cherry! What happened? Cherry is gone again. I'm calling the police. That was the reason the kidnappers got angry. -You want to kill your daughter again? -Nonsense! Enough. Look after Mom. Cherry. Yingying's puzzles show structural principle errors. Her condition is typical PTSD. Her grandma wants to put her on medication. I didn't agree. Don't worry. We'll take good care of her. You're home? Got your personal leave? Still a tad wide. Don't worry, we'll get it fixed. You loved this hat back then. So cute. They're only clothes. What's the big deal? -This isn't helping her recovery. -All right. You're the expert here. It's your call. Happy? You wanted to counsel Cherry. I was against it at first. Then again, it could be a good thing. This is your chance to redeem yourself. Tell them I don't feel well. I won't be in for the next couple days. Should we cancel the hotel room tonight? Don't bother me with trivial matters. This was when we went to Disneyland for the first time. Disneyland had just opened back then. The line was so long, we had to wait for hours. Do you remember? You got so scared when you saw Goofy. Clung onto Dad's sleeve and refused to let go. Since then, whenever you got scared, you'd always cling onto his sleeve. That day was the happiest I've seen Dad. That day was the happiest I've seen Dad. Mom was so pretty, wasn't she? Sometimes when we went out-- Mom. Dad. Sis. Cherry. Yes, it's your eighth birthday party. We were still in Hong Kong. We hadn't gone to LA yet. I've read Cherry's rescue report. But I want to know more about her kidnap case. Go ahead and ask. The day Cherry was kidnapped, only the three of you were home? Cai was there, too. Our butler at the time. He didn't know English... Phone call, ma'am. but had been with us forever. So we brought him to LA. Did you see any strangers? Anything out of the ordinary? Nothing. Nothing unusual. We couldn't find Cherry anywhere. Upon returning home, we found a ransom note in the mailbox. It said they had kidnapped Cherry. Dad rushed back and decided to call the police. The LAPD lay in ambush at the ransom drop. But the kidnappers didn't show. A few days later, another note came. It said they knew we had called the police. They had already killed Cherry. In the next two years, the police had no leads. Cherry had simply vanished. The family-- Nothing was ever the same. Do you hate Daddy? Do you hate me for calling the cops? For abandoning you? Had I known you were still alive, I never would've-- Old Zhang's dog goes raving mad every night. You ought to keep one. It's so remote here. -I can barely support myself. -But it's true. Come on in. Don't be afraid, Cherry. I work here. It's a safe place. It's only Inspector Deng. He wants to ask us a few questions. If I'm right, go ahead and nod. Are they the kidnappers? The bad guys can't hurt you anymore. Trust me. Were you in that basement all this time? Did they take you anywhere else? Did you come into contact with other victims? Were there only three of them? No other accomplice? Don't-- I won't scream. I won't. What happened? I'm here. Don't be afraid. I'm a good girl. I'm good. It's all in the past, Cherry. It's all right. Cherry. Don't be like this. It's all right. -Mrs. Yuan. -What are you doing? -Mom! -What are you doing here? It's okay. You took my daughter without permission. You abducted my daughter. I brought Cherry here. Stay away. I left Cherry with you, why are you hurting her? Haven't you hurt her enough? -Mrs. Yuan. -Don't you ever touch my daughter! -Mrs. Yuan. -Piss off! Why keep Cherry's return a secret, Yiming? She's only been back for three weeks. She needs time to adjust. But you ought to let the family know. Cherry is my daughter. I know what's best. See you in the office. Why did you tell him? I figure he's your brother. Dogs and cats, you can pick. Family? It's never by choice. What about me? What am I? Don't meddle in my family matters. I remember. My flowers. You yanked them out. I remember you said-- Always kissing up to Mom. Useless. You also said-- Go on, cry. Mom falls for it. I don't. Angry? I hope you die. Don't waste my time. I remember Sis loved tomato juice. You like it. Drink up. Go on. Until you die. Jing. This is Dr. Xiao from The University of Hong Kong. He'll take over as Cherry's counsellor. Changing counsellor at this stage would be damaging. You were always jealous of your sister. Nothing has changed. Ever since Cherry's return, you've been irked. What I did wrong in the past, I've been blaming myself. But now I only want to help her. No need. I only want you to be a good sister. Is it too much to ask? Sorry I didn't tell you all these details. I was always jealous of Cherry. She was smarter. More lovable. Kids crave attention. That's normal. Even if you hadn't left her in the yard, the kidnappers would still have found other ways. Or maybe they wouldn't. Maybe Cherry wouldn't have been kidnapped. Don't be too hard on yourself. Who? Who's there? You know I'm back. Cherry? Hospital in 30 minutes. You'll live. You-- You were the one who contacted the kidnappers. -No. Not me. -You were the go-between. No, I didn't-- Who did you work for? Cherry, I watched you grow up. She suffered malnutrition growing up. One of her kidneys was removed. Her liver has also been damaged. And she may never be able to have kids. Enough. It's all my fault. I have never been good to her. I'm a bad sister. I had nothing to do with it. It wasn't me. I really don't know. -Who? -I really don't know. Cai? Cai? Cai? Don't. She's got nothing to do with it. She doesn't know a thing. Who hired you? Yicong. Your uncle Yicong. Back then, he came to me. Paid me to be the go-between. He hired the kidnappers. I was only the contact person. You're back. What time is it? Odd. How did I doze off? -Nothing odd about it. So many pills. -I didn't. Where's Cherry? Cherry. Cherry? What are you doing, Cherry? Dr. Xiao asked me to draw. It helps with my memory. Dad. Mom. Cherry. Eighth birthday party. Remember me? I'm your uncle. Remember? I'm not the one to blame. You think I've done you wrong. What about me? The crap I take from my younger brother. Where is my justice? Now their whole family is heading your way. It's the perfect opportunity. We get the ransom. Split it two ways. Buy a nice tombstone for your mother. How about it? What time will you be home? We won't wait up, then. What took you so long? Want to try their burger? Toast to our partnership. Cai actually had an offshore account. -When was the account opened? -Twelve years ago. That's the opening amount. Transferred from an offshore company called UVC. Twelve years ago? What's wrong, Yingying? Why tear up the pictures? We promised not to behave like this. Twelve years ago, Cai knew the family routine the best. -He was the snitch. -Then whoever paid him-- Is killing off loose ends. -Find out who wired the money. -Yes, sir. Yingying. Yingying! Drunk again last night? No, I wasn't. You can be decadent all you want. But here you are, VP in name. At least pretend to be useful. Look who's talking? Screwing your own secretary and all. Enough is enough. You think I've been happy all these years? You suffered, and so did I! What do you want me to do? Tell me! Tell me! I'm not like you. Am I wrong? I would never disgrace the family like you did! -You're always humiliating me in public. -You humiliated yourself! You had a bastard son the minute we got to Hong Kong and had a two-dollar whore come to blackmail the family. That was years ago. Stop bringing it up. Then stop living off my charity! I'm your older brother. Show some respect. What happened? Yingying? It's okay. INSPECTOR DENG The Commercial Crime Bureau is investigating the CPA to determine who set up the overseas firm for money laundering. Call CCB now. Hurry. Hello, Jing? No one is answering your home phone. Where is Cherry? Cherry went to the mall with Mom. Call Mrs. Yuan now. Tell them to stay with the security. Don't go anywhere. JING Cherry? Are you done? What took you so long? Come and take a look. Well-tailored. The color fits your skin tone. It's pointless. Clothes change. People don't. Silly girl. What do you mean? -Find security. Call them on the PA. -Yes, sir. Cherry will always be Mom's favorite. Nothing matters more than Cherry's happiness. Mom! Move! Mrs. Yuan? Move! Call an ambulance! Hurry up. Control Room, -someone fainted on this floor. -Hurry up. Today, I'm Mother, you're Cherry. I'll take care of you. Let's swap our clothes. Silly. Still a little girl. I left my handbag. Wait outside. Hey! Have you seen-- Get down! Out of the vehicle! Hello? Are you sure it was Yicong? I'm on my way. -Where is the ICU? -Around the corner. -So? -Inspector Deng. Tsong's car is still in the lot. Lock down all exits. Don't look. Calling dispatch. We have a jumper. He's seriously injured and is in a coma. Please send an ambulance. Mrs. Yuan will live. But her nervous system was severely damaged. She was poisoned with TETS. We can't be sure if she will ever wake up. She may be in a coma for life. Are you done, Cherry? Twelve years ago, Yicong conspired with Cai. Enough evidence suggests Cherry's kidnap was planned by Yicong. Cai was the accomplice. Shocked to find her alive, they panicked, and they turned on each other. Yicong's cell phone record indicates that he hired an overseas professional. First, to eliminate Cai. Then to carry out a hit on Cherry. But the hitman mistook his target. With the hit botched, Yicong committed suicide. What about the capsule found on the roof? A prescription med for bipolar disorder and psychosis. Any connection to the case? No evidence to suggest a link. Dad. Look. The flowers are gone with your mom. Mom will wake up. She will. Your mom never liked your uncle. She said, even if I supported him for life, a person like him would never appreciate it. Looking back, I should've listened to her more. Cherry suggests... we sell the company. She said, once we're back in her hometown, it may help your mom's recovery. Cherry suggested that? I've been working hard for years. I've provided you with material needs. My biggest regret is... I've failed to provide the family with love. Now I only want to stay by your mother's side. Sis. Can't we just talk at home? You asked Dad to sell the company? You were gone for 12 years. But I've been here. I've witnessed Dad's hard work. The company is his life. How can we sell it just like that? Yes, all these years, you were here, I wasn't. This is your home. That's not what I mean-- The home, the company, the money, all yours. What kind of a person do you take me for? When I wasn't here, Sis pretended to be a good person. Now I'm back. You can't pretend anymore. All these years, I was praying you were alive. I was longing for your return. Cherry. I'm no longer the sister who bullied you. Can't you forgive and forget? Forget? Then what's left? Has it occurred to you? If you were the one kidnapped, who would you be now? Life has no U-turns. Be good and I'll take you home. Thank you, Mr. Yuan. I've made too many mistakes. I broke your mother's heart. I hurt you and your sister. But Jing brought me to my senses. She's right. I have to believe your mother will wake up. Believe it's not too late to start over. Cherry. I gave up on you once. It was my biggest mistake. I can't let it happen again. Never again. I won't sell the company. I'll take good care of your mother, of you and Jing, of this family. I once had faith, too. Two years after the kidnap, I went home. I went home... to look for Dad, for Mom. But you'd left, you'd abandoned me. That day, everything... was already too late. Told you so. We are two of a kind. Unwanted. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. Forever and ever. I don't want to go back in the basement. All right. From this day on, we're family. Miss Yuan. Where is Inspector Deng? He's taken leave and he went-- Dad? Hello? -Jing, I have done you wrong-- -What did you say? -Done your mother wrong-- -Hello? -Don't let them-- -Where are you, Dad? Hello? Cherry, what happened? Where's Dad? Speak up. Is Dad home? He didn't come back all day. Look at me. Look at me! How does it feel to lose your family? To lose everything? You were all alone over there. You think I wanted that? You didn't? Who abandoned us? Who kicked us out with a few lousy bucks? You're my flesh and blood. It was your uncle. He called your mother a whore. Called you a bastard. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Now they're heading your way. It's the perfect opportunity. We get the ransom. Split it two ways. Buy a nice tombstone for your mother. How about it? I'm not your pet. It's not over. Call me! The forensic report is in. Mr. Yuan's blood alcohol content was high. The cause of death was from the heel and the crash. Cut the crap. Just tell me, where the hell is Deng? The purchase of Yuan Enterprises is complete. The buyer will wire the full amount tomorrow. Mr. Yuan drafted a memo the day before his death. Stating Cherry Yuan shall have full control over the funds from the company sale. You knew. You knew something had happened to Dad. All the tragedies happened after your return. Was it you? What do you want? Who are you? Who exactly are you? What do you want? The money? It will be deposited tomorrow. Cheer up. Everything has gone according to plan. I'm your father! Are you mad? Stop! What do you want? What kind of father tells his son to kill a little girl? No! Revenge is a dish best served cold. You taught me that! I'm not your pet. It's not over. One last step. Your sister. She suspects you now. No loose ends. You promised to spare Dad, and to spare Sis. Take the money. Take me, I'll go with you. You still call him Dad and her Sis? You've got blood on your hands. Life has no U-turns. In two weeks, the wounds will scab. The police will think you have lived here your whole life. What about them? Are you going to-- The three crackheads? The cops will take care of them. And you? Are you ready for the show? Without me, the three crackheads wouldn't have let you live. You owe me a life! It's fine. Now, that's my baby girl. Who-- Who's there? This is Jing. Please leave a message. I'm back from LA. Call me right away. All this time, I missed the most obvious flaw. Cai was brought to LA by your family. He didn't know English, but had been with us forever. Cai spoke no English. How could he contact the kidnappers? The only explanation is there weren't three kidnappers. There were four. The fourth man spoke Chinese. Stay home and watch Cherry. I'll be right there. No need to look around. There's only the three of us here. Selling the company, the older sister doesn't get a dime and then comes to threaten her sibling. She ends up getting killed by her younger sister. Time to end it all. All these years, you hated your sister the most. This is your chance. Don't be soft. Cherry. You can't. You can't do this. This is your home. A phony, pathetic family. Kill her! Family is everything. Shut up! This family was destroyed long ago! You should've repaid your debt long ago! You've changed. You've changed ever since your return. In the end, you're a Yuan. You will always... always be... mine. The one I hate the most... is you. Who are you? You're not human. It's all right. I'm sorry. Cherry.
