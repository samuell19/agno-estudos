HI. HI, BOSS. JOHN, IT'S MARY. NOT THERE? OK. UM, DON'T FORGET TO CALL THE KIDS. Man: JOHN, IT'S JACK AGAIN. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU FOR DAYS. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU'VE MISSED THE DEADLINE TWICE ALREADY. IF YOU DON'T GET IN TOUCH WITH ME BY THE END OF TODAY, THAT'S IT, WE'RE KILLING THE STORY. [TYPING ON COMPUTER KEYBOARD] YEAH? UH-HUH, I KNOW. MORGAN GRENFELL SAID THAT THEY WERE RELEASING THE DOCUMENT TODAY. NO. I WOULD HAVE SAID "YESTERDAY" IF I MEANT YESTERDAY. TODAY. YOUR TODAY. YEAH. I'LL PUT IT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE END. OK. BYE. [BAGPIPE MARCHING BAND PLAYING] TV announcer: SCORES OF BRITISH LAWYERS, ADMINISTRATORS, AND POLICE-- ALL OF THEM LONG-TIME EMPLOYEES OF THE HONG KONG GOVERNMENT-- BOARDED THE SHIP ORIANA. THEIR DESTINATION--ENGLAND. BUT THIS WAS NO ORDINARY FAREWELL. THOSE SAILING OUT ON THE ORIANA ARE PART OF AN EXODUS OF BRITONS LEAVING HONG KONG AS THE COLONIAL ERA DRAWS TO AN END. Man: THERE IS A REVENGE ELEMENT IN IT, WE THINK. "REVENGE" IN QUOTATION MARKS. THAT PEOPLE IN THE PAST MAY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST PURELY BECAUSE THEY WERE OF A PARTICULAR RACE. NOW THE REVERSE APPEARS TO BE SO. THE DAYS OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGES FOR BRITISH CITIZENS HERE ARE OVER. AND AS THE ORIANA SAILED INTO THE SUNSET, THERE WAS A PALPABLE SENSE OF AN ERA COMING TO AN END. Man: JOHN. JOHN, UP HERE. UP HERE. SOMEONE YOU SHOULD MEET. THIS CHARMING LADY IS AMANDA EVERHEART. HELLO, AMANDA EVERHEART. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. SHE WANTS TO KNOW EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT HONG KONG, AND THE CLEVER THING STARTED BY READING YOUR BOOK. I WONDER, WOULD YOU MIND SIGNING A COPY FOR ME. I'D JUST LOVE THAT. I THOUGHT THIS WAS OUT OF PRINT. I FOUND IT FASCINATING. HOLD THAT, WILL YOU? AND...YOU READ IT? YES, I DID. I TOOK A FEW TIPS AND MADE A FEW INVESTMENTS ACTUALLY, I PARTICULARLY LIKED THE CHAPTER WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT HONG KONG AS AN HONEST WHORE. OF COURSE, WE'RE ALL DYING TO FIND OUT HOW SHE COPES WITH HER NEW PIMP. SPEAKING OF WHICH, HERE'S A MAN WHO HAS VERY STRONG VIEWS ON THAT SUBJECT. I'LL LEAVE YOU IN HIS CAPABLE HANDS. DON'T LET HIM GET TOO CLOSE. Man: WHAT WILL YOU DO, MR. SPENCER, WHEN THE SUN RISES OVER HONG KONG ON JULY FIRST? WELL, MISS CHAPLIN-ARISTEDES, I THINK I SHALL GET OUT OF BED, HAVE A BIT OF A FART, A SHIT, A SHAVE, AND A SHOWER, AND, UM, AND THEN I'LL LOOK FOR MY-- LISTEN, NOTHING'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT, IS IT? THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 10, 15 YEARS. NOTHING'S GOING TO CHANGE. I KNOW THAT. THIS GREAT BIG DEPARTMENT STORE IS JUST HAVING A CHANGE OF MANAGEMENT, THAT'S ALL. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. I HAVE A PROBLEM. I CANNOT PHOTOGRAPH SOCIAL CRISIS UNTIL SOMEBODY DIES. THEY GAVE ME MONEY. I'M NOT GIVING IT BACK. I'D RATHER GIVE THEM A KIDNEY. BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM. WHAT AM I GONNA DO? HUH? WHERE AM I GONNA GET THE REAL STUFF? THE REAL STUFF IS THE DEALS. THE DEALS HAPPEN BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. WHAT DEALS? YOU BEEN HERE WHAT NOW, 15 YEARS, BECAUSE OF DEALS? John: OF COURSE IT ISN'T JUST THE DEALS. SOMETIMES YOU JUST FALL IN LOVE WITH A PLACE WITHOUT REALLY KNOWING WHY, WITHOUT REALLY EVER FULLY UNDERSTANDING IT... THE WAY I FELL IN LOVE WITH VIVIAN. HOW IS IT I WANT SO BADLY THE ONE WOMAN I CAN'T HAVE? JOHN, HOW ARE YOU? HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE, THANKS. NICE TO SEE YOU. YOU'RE SOBER, YEAH? SOBER, YEAH? WE ARE ABOUT 3 MINUTES AND 20 SECONDS TO GO. Man: CHANG. SO, JOHN, WHY DON'T YOU ASK VIVIAN TO DANCE? YOU KNOW I'M NEVER GOOD WITH THIS SORT OF THING. I MIGHT DO THAT. I'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE, RIGHT? John: SO MUCH OF HONG KONG EXISTS BELOW THE SURFACE. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THIS IS THE WOMAN I LOVE ABOVE EVERYTHING. IF THEY COULD SEE WHAT I SEE HIDDEN IN HER EYES. 'TIS AN OLD GAME WE PLAY, TELLING OURSELVES THIS IS ENOUGH. I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHAT? I--I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ARE WE READY TO CELEBRATE THE LAST FEW SECONDS OF HISTORIC 1996? NOW, LET'S HOPE... LET'S HOPE THAT THE HONG KONG THAT WE KNOW AND LOVE WILL STILL BE HERE SAME TIME NEXT YEAR. ALL RIGHT, IT'S THAT TIME. ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, HERE WE GO. COUNT WITH ME. 10... Crowd: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1! [CHEERING, TOY HORNS TOOTING] [ORCHESTRA PLAYS AULD LANG SYNE] HAPPY NEW YEAR. [ORCHESTRA STOPS PLAYING] STAY BACK! STAY BACK. STAY BACK! STAY BACK! STAY BACK! MY ACTION... IS A STAND AGAINST THE LOSS OF PERSONAL... AND CULTURAL FREEDOM IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997. THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL DECISION. I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO BE BLAMED. Man: CALL THE POLICE. SOMEONE CALL THE POLICE. CALL THE POLICE! Man: CALL FOR A DOCTOR! IS THERE A DOCTOR HERE SOMEWHERE? SOMEBODY CALL FOR A DOCTOR. KEEP THEM BACK. PLEASE. TV announcer: THOUSANDS MOURNED THE DEATH OF WILLIAM WONG, THE STUDENT ACTIVIST WHO SHOT HIMSELF AT THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT IN FRONT OF THE UP-MARKET CROWD AT THE HONG KONG CLUB'S NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY. THE LEADER OF THE FRONT LINE THEATER GROUP, ERIC LEE, HAS ADMITTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR HELPING THE DISTRAUGHT STUDENT STAGE THE SUICIDE. THE GROUP HAS DESCRIBED ITS ACTION AS THE THEATER OF ASSISTED SUICIDE. Man: THE CITY OF HOPE IS BECOMING A CITY OF FEAR. WHY? BECAUSE THE CHINESE WANT TO CHANGE ALL THE LAWS RELATING TO HUMAN RIGHTS. THEY'RE TAKING THAT REFUSAL TO ADMIT MISTAKES RIGHT THERE INTO THE HISTORY BOOKS IN HONG KONG. SO WHAT ARE MY KIDS ASKED-- BUT THAT'S FACE, ISN'T IT? WELL, FACE MAY BE, BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN THING CALLED TRUTH, AND THEY DON'T ADMIT IT. IS OUR TRUTH ANY BETTER-- MY KIDS ARE BEING ASKED TO BELIEVE LIES. IS OUR TRUTH ANY BETTER THAN THEIR TRUTH? THEIR TRUTH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A DEMOCRACY. IT'S THEIR PERSPECTIVE INSTEAD OF A BRITISH PERSPECTIVE. EVEN THE SAN FRANCISCO COURTS HAVE DECIDED IN ADVANCE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN 1997. Man: VERY GOOD, TOO. THERE IS A PROBLEM. WEEKS, IF THERE'S ANY PROBLEM AT ALL, IT'S THE MAKING OF THE LIKES OF YOU. AND THE WICKED FOREIGN PRESS IS TO BLAME. OF COURSE. THIS IS GETTING A BIT TOO HEAVY. REALLY, WHAT HONG KONG IS ABOUT IS MAKING MEGA BUCKS. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. THERE'S $25 BILLION NOW EARMARKED FOR CHINA FROM U.S. AND DIRECT INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT. I CAN SEE THE DOLLAR SIGNS BLINKING IN YOUR EYES. WELL, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? IT'S A BLOODY CASINO. IT'S JUST LIKE A CASINO. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT... JOHN. AH, JOHN. IS THIS WATER? YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY. DON'T FORGET THAT HONG HONG NEVER HAD DEMOCRACY AND HONG KONG NEVER ASKED FOR DEMOCRACY AND DIDN'T GET IT TILL 1984. BUT HAVING BEEN GIVEN IT AS A PRESENT, IT MIGHT MISS IT IF IT'S TAKEN AWAY AGAIN. YOU FEELING OK? WOULD YOU MISS A PRESENT IF IT WAS TAKEN AWAY? Man: WHAT THEY DID WAS THEY BOUGHT THE RIGHTS TO BUY 1,000 FLATS. WHEN THEY GOT THEM, THEY WERE SELLING THEM OFF FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS EACH. YOU CYNICAL SON OF A BITCH. [TALKING OVER EACH OTHER] I GOT A LAWYER HERE TO TAKE YOU TO THE CLEANERS. THAT'S HOW HONG KONG IS. EVERYTHING HAS ITS PRICE. EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE. NOBODY FALLS IN LOVE. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE. Woman: OH, BUT LOVE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. IF YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU. HEY, GET UP. COME ON, GET UP. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WHAT HAPPENED? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? SORRY. HAVE YOU HAD A BIT TOO MUCH? THE CONVERSATION WAS SO...BORING, I FELL ASLEEP. OH, COME ON. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY. THAT'S ALL YOU HEAR. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE, AS WELL. YEAH, WELL, I NEVER COULD FACE IT. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? WE'D BETTER DO THOSE TESTS RIGHT NOW. OK. John: THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN YOU SEE YOUR LIFE VERY CLEARLY... THE THINGS YOU'VE LEFT UNDONE. THAT TIME IN BEIJING. WE WERE BOTH READY FOR EACH OTHER. IT SEEMED INEVITABLE WE WOULD BECOME LOVERS. AND YET WE LET IT PASS. AND THEN IT SLIPPED AWAY. * DOO-WA-WA DOO-WA-WA * DOO-WA-WA DOO-WAAA * AHHH... EXCUSE ME. CLOSING TIME. HI. I QUIT MY JOB. I'M TIRED OF JUNK... DOESN'T LAST EVEN A DAY. STOCK EXCHANGE PRICES... CORPORATE EARNINGS. I NEED SOMETHING ELSE, NOT HERE TODAY AND GONE TOMORROW. YOU WON'T FIND THAT IN HONG KONG. BUT YOU SEE, I HAVE. YOU HAVE? THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU TO COME AWAY WITH ME. I CAN'T. YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE WAITING FOR CHANG TO ASK YOU TO MARRY HIM. AND THAT'S WRONG? OF COURSE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART HE'S NEVER GOING TO ASK YOU. WILL YOU MARRY ME? THANK YOU. I... I CAN'T. WHY? WHAT ARE YOU FRIGHTENED OF? I'M OFFERING YOU-- I'M OFFERING YOU SOMETHING REAL. I'M OFFERING YOU SOMETHING NOW, SOMETHING CONCRETE. DON'T BE A COWARD. PLEASE. John: THEY SAY THAT IF YOU'RE BLEEDING FROM A BROKEN HEART... YOU MUST GET A PIECE OF JADE AND KEEP IT CLOSE. THEN YOUR BLOOD WILL GO INTO THE STONE, AND THE STONE WILL GET INTO YOUR BLOOD. YOUR BLOOD WILL THEN BECOME STONE... AND YOU WILL STOP BLEEDING. Young woman: HI! I'VE GOT SOME GOODIES FOR YOU. LOOK AT THESE WATCHES. HOW ABOUT SOME HANDBAGS? HEY, GUYS. ROLEXES. CARTIERS. DUNHILL LIGHTERS. NO, NO. COME ON. A BARGAIN. $100. HEY, BOYS. YOU WANT PRETTY GIRLS? NO. COME ON, I CAN TAKE YOU TO A GOOD PLACE. FUCK OFF! Doctor: HOW ARE YOU FEELING, JOHN? FINE. GOOD. DOES IT HURT? UH, I'LL LIVE. A BIT SORE IN THE BUTT. SO...IS THAT TEST FINISHED? WE'VE DONE ALL THE TESTS WE NEED TO, AND WE PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. GOOD, AND WHAT IS THAT? I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. YOU'VE GOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE. IT'S A FORM OF LEUKEMIA, AND I THINK IT'S GONE TO YOUR BRAIN, AS WELL. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GETTING THESE DIZZY SPELLS AND FAINTING. IT'S NOT COMMON, BUT IT'S SPREADING VERY QUICKLY. John: HOW LONG DO WE HAVE, DO YOU THINK? Doctor: 3 MONTHS... 6 MONTHS. Jim: THEY START TO TALK AND THE GIRL SORT OF BACKING AWAY FROM HIM AND FINALLY HE GETS HER INTO THE THING AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HEARS--BAM BAM BAM ON THE DOOR. AND HE FREAKS OUT AND THE GIRL IS-- HEY! SO YOU KNOW WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING? SOME GUY ESCAPED FROM AN INSANE ASYLUM-- WHAT WAS THAT? HE SAID THERE IS A BOMB IN THE CITY COUNCIL. THAT'S WHY SLOW TRAFFIC. OH, FUCK! I CAN'T BEAR THIS FUCKING CITY. I CAN'T... IS IT VIVIAN? John: JUST A WEEK AGO, ALL I WANTED WAS TO TELL VIVIAN HOW MUCH I LOVED HER. BUT NOW I SEE THAT'S THE ONE THING I MUSTN'T DO. I CAN'T OFF-LOAD MY ILLNESS ONTO HER... OR JIM... OR MARY AND THE KIDS. I DON'T WANT THE LOOK IN THEIR EYES TO REMIND ME I'M DYING. I WONDER IF I CAN HOLD OUT LONGER THAN THE BRITISH. NOT THAT I CAN BE DESCRIBED AS AN EMPIRE. AND ANYWAY, HONG KONG WON'T DIE. IT'LL CHANGE MAYBE. John: COFFEE. Waiter: COFFEE. IS THE COFFEE ANY GOOD HERE? AWFUL. SO WHY COME HERE? BECAUSE NOBODY DISTURBS ME HERE. WHY ARE YOU STARING? I WASN'T STARING. I WAS JUST LOOKING AT YOU. VERY FUNNY. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE IN HONG KONG LOOK QUITE LIKE YOU. YOUR CLOTHES, YOUR...BEHAVIOR. I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOU. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHAT'S YOURS? JOHN. JEAN. CAN I INTERVIEW YOU, JEAN? I'LL PAY YOU. WHAT FOR? I'M INTERESTED. I'M INTERESTED IN HOW YOU... HOW YOU SEE, HOW YOU PERCEIVE HONG KONG, WHAT YOU DO HERE, HOW YOU EARN A LIVING. I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU. IT INTERESTS ME ABOUT WHETHER... WHETHER YOU WILL BE AS FREE WHEN THE, UH... WHEN THE TAKEOVER HAPPENS, WHETHER YOU CAN STILL LIVE THE LIFE YOU HAVE LIVED TILL NOW. LISTEN, WHAT'S FREE? AH. MY COFFEE WOULD BE FREE IF YOU PAID FOR IT. THEN I'LL PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE. THANK YOU. CAN I DO AN INTERVIEW? WELL, ACTUALLY, I'VE GOT TO GO. I HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT. LISTEN, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, LET ME... JUST GIVE ME A CALL. YEAH, I'LL PAY YOU. AH. HMM. IT'S OPEN. YOU GOTTA BE A DAMN SHERPA TO CLIMB THESE STAIRS. ARE YOU MOVING IN?

WHO IS SHE? I DON'T KNOW. THERE. SHE'S ALL WRAPPED UP. FACE COVERED. EARS COVERED. THE ONLY THING YOU SEE ARE THE EYES. SHE'S HIDING. EVERYBODY SHOULD WEAR A MASK WITH THE AIR QUALITY HERE. WHAT'S SHE HIDING FROM? THIS IS GOOD. GREAT LIGHT. BEAUTIFUL... AND BORING. * STANDIN' ON A CORNER * IN HONG KONG * DADDY-O * MY BABY WAS GONE * IN HONG KONG John: HE'S MAKING ARMANI SUITS.

NOT MESS YOUR SHOW, YOU KNOW. HO HO. LOOK AT THIS ONE. LOOK AT THIS ONE. SHE'S--SHE'S GREAT. SHE'S... SHE'S HALF THAI WITH 2 BABIES, VERY SENTIMENTAL... Jim: MM-HMM. BUT VICIOUS. RIGHT? MM-HMM. YOU LIKE THIS ONE? SHE--SHE--SHE LAUGH ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY. AND THIS ONE, SHE HAS BEEN IN, UH, IN SOME MAGAZINE AS COVER GIRL, LIKE THAT. THIS ONE HAS BEEN DOING SOME--SOME MOVIE, OF COURSE, THE SEXY MOVIES, YOU KNOW. Jim: THIS IS FOR A MAGAZINE. Mamasan: UH-HUH. Jim: THIS IS A SHOOT FOR A MAGAZINE LAYOUT. MM-HMM. AND, UM, THE BUDGET IS NOT THAT BIG. NOW, LOOK, LOOK. HONG KONG IS A VERY PRACTICAL CITY. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT KIND OF BIG MAGAZINE OR SMALL MAGAZINE-- I REALLY NEED SOMEBODY WHO'S MORE INTERESTING THAN THESE FACES-- WHO'S THIS? DO YOU KNOW THAT GIRL? WHICH ONE? THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE. OH, SHE'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND TOO HIGH CLASS FOR-- DOES--DOES SHE WORK HERE? NO, NO, NOT HERE. IT'S A VERY OLD PICTURE. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER-- WAS SHE A HOSTESS? SHE LOOKS LIKE ONE. PROBABLY IN THE PLACE CALLED BLACK MOON, THE MOST EXPENSIVE NIGHTCLUB IN HONG KONG. SO IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER-- WHETHER YOU--YOU WANT THEM TO BE NUDE OR WITH BIKINI OR WITH... YOU MEAN TO TELL ME AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, YOU NEVER MADE IT WITH HER? TROUBLE IS, I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HER. I KEEP SEEING HER WORKING AS A WHORE... TAKING HER CLOTHES OFF, SMILING AT SOME... GUY SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW, LYING BESIDE HIM IN A SLEAZY HOTEL ROOM. SOMETIMES IT'S NICE TO BE THE ONLY ONE. YOU KNOW, THAT DOG DOES THAT ALL THE TIME... JUST TO PLEASE HIS MASTER. EVERY DAY, HE RUNS TILL HE DROPS, AND THEN THEY LIFT HIM OUT, PUT HIM BACK IN HIS CAGE ALONE IN THE DARK... JUST SO THAT WHEN THEY WANT HIM TO FIGHT, HE'LL WIN FOR THEM. John: IT WASN'T THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT VIVIAN AND CHANG. SHE TOLD ME ABOUT HER ESCAPE FROM THE MAINLAND, AND...HOW SHE'D MET HIM SOON AFTER SHE'D ARRIVED IN HONG KONG. ABOUT THE SACRIFICES THEY'D MADE TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE TODAY. I'D HEARD THAT SHE'D SUPPORTED HIM WHEN HE WAS STARTING OUT, INTRODUCING HIM TO USEFUL CONTACTS. BUT ONLY NOW DID I REALIZE QUITE HOW THOSE CONTACTS HAD BEEN MADE. HI, CHANG. HI, JOHN. HOW'S BUSINESS? FINE, THANK YOU. THE WORD IS YOU'VE GOT PROBLEMS. YEAH, PROBLEMS. WANT A DRINK? THANK YOU. BOURBON. Man: VIVIAN! HEY. HI. FRIENDS OF YOURS? YEAH. WHERE DOES THE BLONDE COME FROM? RUSSIA, PROBABLY. OH, YEAH. A LOT OF RUSSIANS IN THAT LINE, I HEAR. I WOULDN'T KNOW. YOU KNOW WHY, UH... WHY CHINESE PEOPLE LIKE BLONDES, DON'T YOU? WHY, JOHN? SO THEY CAN SLEEP WITH THEM WITHOUT BEING REMINDED OF THEIR WIVES. I TOLD YOU THIS, JOHN. REMEMBER? WHO'S THE GUY? HER AGENT. HER AGENT. WHAT, THE SORT THAT, UM, INTRODUCES TALENTED ARTISTS TO, UH, TO RICH PATRONS? YEAH? I BET SHE EARNED A BIT FOR THAT. MAYBE I SHOULD BE AN AGENT. I WANT TO CHANGE MY JOB. MAYBE I SHOULD DO THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY EARN WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY EARN? DO YOU KNOW? 20%? 25%, MAYBE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OK, JOHN. WHAT'S WRONG? IS SOMETHING WRONG? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG. WHAT IS IT? TELL ME. NOTHING. NOTHING. EXCEPT THAT I LOVE THIS WOMAN, AND SHE LOVES YOU. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THIS WOMAN. THERE'S SOMETHING, UH... THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU. IT'S ABOUT THIS. BRING BACK MEMORIES? IS THAT WHY HE CAN'T MARRY YOU? YOU'RE AN IMPORTANT MAN, JOHN, AREN'T YOU? IMPORTANT MAN. BUSINESSMAN. THAT'S ENOUGH, JOHN. A PUBLIC MAN. Woman: WAIT-- I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU-- I AM HER AGENT-- THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING AS BEAUTIFUL AS THIS? Chang: THAT'S ENOUGH, JOHN. SORRY TO DISTURB YOU. I HAVE A VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL LADY. THIS LADY IS MY CLIENT. I REPRESENT HER. I AM THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVE. I ONLY TAKE 30%. SHE'S AT THE BAR. WHEN YOU HAVE A MOMENT, GO AND SEE HER. SHE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL LADY. I'M SORRY. DO YOU SEE THIS LADY? I AM HER AGENT. SHE IS-- SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL LADY. BEAUTIFUL LADY. LEAVE ME ALONE. I'M TALKING TO THIS MAN! DON'T DO THAT TO ME! I'M TALKING! LISTEN, I WANT TO SHOW YOU THIS-- THIS BEAUTIFUL LADY. GO ON, CHANG. YOU DON'T FIGHT, DO YOU? YOU DON'T FIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU'RE A PIMP! AND PIMPS DON'T FIGHT! OK, JOHN. COME ON. LEAVE ME ALONE. OK, RELAX, JOHN. IT'S FINE. OK, JOHN. GIVE IT TO ME, JOHN, PLEASE. PLEASE. BURN IT. Chang: THE SUCCESS OF HONG KONG RELIES UPON ITS AMAZING CAPABILITY TO ADOPT TO THE EVER-CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. Interviewer: BUT WHAT ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON RUMORS OF YOUR AFFILIATION WITH SOME LESS THAN REPUTABLE BUSINESSMEN? Chang: HA HA. MY PARTNERS AND I AND THE CHANG-LIN GROUP ARE ALL LEGITIMATE BUSINESSMEN, AND WE HAD A LONG GOOD RECORD WITH DOING BUSINESS IN CHINA. THE RUMOR IS, UH, RIDICULOUS. Jean: JOHN SPENCER! DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT INTERVIEW? MAYBE. WELL, DO YOU WANT IT OR NOT? John: WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE WORTH? $1,400. $1,400? YEAH. I COULD GET A HOOKER FOR THAT. WELL, GO AND GET YOURSELF A HOOKER. I DON'T CARE. BUT YOU WON'T HAVE A STORY. ALL RIGHT, $1,400. BUT IT BETTER BE GOOD. I DON'T WANT ANY RUBBISH. I WANT THE REAL STORY. I WANT ALL THE NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS. YOU BET YOU WILL GET THAT. COME ON. GOOD. WELL, THEN... I'LL TELL YOU ALL MY SECRETS. YES, ALL YOUR SECRETS. AND I'M GONNA VIDEO IT, ALL RIGHT? I'M GONNA FILM IT ALL. WHAT, I'LL BE ON TV? SO I'M A PAID TV STAR NOW? WELL, YOU'LL BE PAID. I'M NOT SURE YOU'LL BE A TV STAR. WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING. WHAT? I DON'T LIKE ANSWERING QUESTIONS, THOUGH. JESUS. WELL, AN INTERVIEW IS ME ASKING QUESTIONS AND YOU ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THAT IS THE NATURE OF AN INTERVIEW. WELL, NOT NECESSARILY. YOU'D GET A BETTER STORY IF YOU GAVE ME YOUR CAMERA, AND I TAPE IT MYSELF. I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. OH, YEAH? DO YOU SEE "MUG" WRITTEN ON THIS FACE? OH, YEAH, I SEE IT NOW. I'LL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN, WILL I? NEVER AGAIN. COME ON, YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME. THIS IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD. COME ON, SIT DOWN HERE. I DON'T WANT TO SIT DOWN. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO WORK IT. HURRY UP. I DON'T HAVE TIME. YOU GOTTA LEARN HOW TO WORK IT. I DON'T WANT IT MESSED UP. IT'S A VERY VALUABLE CAMERA. TAKE THIS OFF. DON'T TRY AND DO IT WITHOUT THAT. NOW, THAT'S HOW YOU TURN IT ON, ALL RIGHT? MY NAME IS JEAN. I WAS BORN IN 1970. WE LIVED IN A VERY SMALL PLACE, VERY CRAMPED, THE 5 OF US. SISTERS. 3 SISTERS. IT WAS LIKE A ROOM. MY FAMILY'S FROM CHINA. MY DAD WORKED... BUT HE WASN'T MUCH HELP, BECAUSE HE GAMBLED A LOT, TOO. AND HE USED TO LOSE A LOT OF MONEY. AND WHEN HE DOES THAT, HE'LL TAKE IT OUT ON MOM. AND I REMEMBER... ON REALLY HOT SUMMER NIGHTS, MY DAD WOULD GO OUT AND GET DRUNK. AND THEN HE WOULD COME HOME... AND HE... HE WOULD FUCK US... THE 3 OF US IN TURN. * DAH-DAH DAH-DEE-DAH JOHN! JOHN! YEAH? A GIRL LEAVE YOU THIS. Jean: AS I GREW OLDER, I COULDN'T HAVE SEX FOR LOVE. IT WAS TOO PAINFUL. SO I DID IT FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. MY PIMP, HE HAD AN IDEA. HE MADE DATES WITH TOURISTS WHO WOULD COME TO ME. AND THEN WHEN THEY SEE ME, THEY'RE HORRIFIED, AND THEY RUN OFF. SO I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING, AND I GOT MONEY. IT WAS A SCAM. BECAUSE THEY STILL HAD TO PAY ME BECAUSE THEY MADE A DEAL ALREADY. SO, THANKS TO MY SCAR, YOU KNOW, MY PRIVATE PARTS DIDN'T GET TOO SORE. Jean: THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS. ONE TIME, THERE'S THIS COP. HE'S A BIT FUCKED UP IN THE HEAD. AND HE REALLY WANTED TO DO IT WITH ME. YOU KNOW, REALLY. AND I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DO IT. THAT WAS HORRIBLE. AND HE USED A BLOODSTAINED JADE. IT WAS EVIDENCE FROM A SEX CRIME HE WAS INVESTIGATING ON. AND HE DID IT WITH THAT FOR HOURS AND HOURS, AND IT REALLY HURT. I WAS SCREAMING, I WAS KICKING, I WAS DOING EVERYTHING I COULD TO STOP HIM, BUT I COULDN'T. SO I GRABBED A KNIFE... AND I CUT HIS DICK OFF. YEAH. THERE WAS BLOOD EVERYWHERE. SHE CUT THE GUY'S DICK OFF? THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS. WELL, THERE'S A VANISHING IMAGE OF HONG KONG FOR YOU. HEY, WHAT IS THAT RED THING IN THE BACKGROUND WITH THAT FACE ON IT? THAT'S A FACE MAP. HMM. THEY USE IT FOR TELLING FORTUNES HERE. THEY BELIEVE THAT A MAP OF THE FACE IS A MAP OF A LIFE... AND YOU CAN READ EVERYTHING IN IT. CAN YOU READ ANYTHING IN THIS GIRL'S FACE? I TELL YOU, I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO PHOTOGRAPH HER. SHE'S THE MOST INTERESTING SUBJECT I'VE SEEN SO FAR. HOW CAN I GET IN TOUCH WITH HER? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW... WHERE SHE LIVES. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HER, EXCEPT WHAT SHE SAYS. AND THAT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO BELIEVE. DO YOU BELIEVE IT? DID YOU FUCK HER? HMM. NO. YOU KNOW, I WRITE EVERY DAY ABOUT THIS PLACE. I WRITE ABOUT THE ECONOMY. I WRITE ABOUT THE POLITICS. AND YET I UNDERSTAND ZILCH. NOTHING. AND I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT...IF I COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT MAKES THIS THING TICK-- THIS STRANGE, FUNNY GIRL-- THAT I'D... I'D JUST--I'D BE IN TOUCH WITH... SOMETHING, YOU KNOW? WHAT IS THAT? NORTH KOREA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT NORTH KOREA EITHER. NOW... LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW. ABOUT MY SCAR AND HOW I GOT IT. HERE'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT... NOTHING. SHH! * BLACK MARKET * SNEAK AROUND THE CORNER * WITH A BANISHED HEART * BLACK MARKET * PEEK AROUND THE CORNER * NOW PLEASE, CAN YOU PASS HER? * * COME, COME, I'LL SHOW YOU THINGS * * YOU CANNOT GET ELSEWHERE * COME * MAKE WITH THE OFFERS * THEN YOU'LL GET YOUR SHARE * * BLACK MARKET * "X" FOR STATUESQUE * MILES OF CIGARETTES * SOME BROKEN-DOWN IDEALS * AND WEDDING RINGS SHOOH. * AND TALK AND TALK... * TRADE YOUR THINGS * YOU WANT MY PORCELAIN FIGURE? * * A WATCH * A SUBMARINE * A REMBRANDT * SALAMI * BLACK LINGERIE FROM PARIS * * AND SO, MY GOOD-- DO YOU KNOW WHAT MARLENE DIETRICH SAID TO A PRODUCER FRIEND OF HERS AT PARAMOUNT STUDIOS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW GARY COOPER? NO. SHE SAID, "OOH, DADDY, WILL YOU GET ME HIM?" THE BAR IS CLOSED. NO, UM... IT'S A BIT EARLY FOR THAT. I CAME... TO... TEACH YOU A FEW ENGLISH WORDS, LIKE: I'M SORRY I BEHAVED... LIKE A JERK. UM... AND--AND PLEASE FORGIVE ME; AND I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU; IT'S THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO. WHAT DO YOU WANT? THAT'S THE TROUBLE. I DON'T KNOW. I TRIED TO MAKE YOU LOVE ME AND THAT DIDN'T WORK. I TRIED TO HATE YOU AND THAT... SO I SUPPOSE I JUST WANT... TO BE FRIENDS... FRIENDS WITH YOU. I DON'T WANT A FRIEND LIKE YOU. * FOOD FOR YOUR "K" RATIONS * * COMPASSION * AND BELIEVE YOUR OWN DREAMS * * A DRINK * OF REAL SYMPATHY * I'M SELLING OUT * TAKE ALL I GOT * AMBITION * CONVICTION * THE WORKS * RIGHT NOW * ENJOY THESE GOODS * OH, BOY, ARE THESE GOOD * HONEY SO HOW'S VIVIAN? HOW'S THAT GOING? YOU KNOW, EVERY LOVE STORY IS THE SAME. I MEAN, JUST... WE HAVE BOLEROS FOR THAT, TO DESCRIBE THE WHOLE THING. USUALLY BOLEROS ARE WRITTEN WHEN LOVE BEGINS... AND WHEN LOVE ENDS. AND IN THE MIDDLE... NOTHING, BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT... * LIFE IS VERY NICE WITH YOU-- * NO. JUST THE BEGINNING. THE LOVE BEGINS AND YOU GO... * I LOVE YOU * AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE WORLD * * AND I WILL LOVE YOU * EVEN MORE THAN I LOVE MYSELF * RIGHT? AND THEN THE RELATIONSHIP ENDS. AND THEN... * I HATE YOU * I REALLY HATE YOU * I MEAN, I DETEST YOU * AND I HOPE YOUR PET * IS RUN OVER BY A TRUCK * * BECAUSE * YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT * YOU KNOW, THEY SEND YOU A RECORD-- I SWEAR TO GOD, WOMEN ARE SOMETHING ELSE-- CUT WITH A KNIFE. EVERY SINGLE SONG EXCEPT THE ONE THAT THEY WANT YOU TO HEAR. AND THIS IS WHEN THEY'RE VERY UPSET WITH YOU. YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN THAT YET, NO? AND IT'LL GO LIKE... * I DETEST YOU AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR. YOU'RE A NIGHTMARE. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA MOVE OUT AGAIN? * PERO NO SON NOTHING * GIVE ME SOME PEACE, FOR GOD'S SAKE. YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ONE? OK, LET ME SING YOU THE REAL ONE-- THE ONE THAT YOU REALLY LIKE. John: THAT NIGHT VIVIAN WATCHED THE BOLDEST SHOW OF SUPPORT CHANG HAD EVER MADE. BUT BY NOW SHE HAD LEARNED THE LIMIT OF HIS COMMITMENT. AND FOR HER... IT WAS NOT ENOUGH. FOR IN THE STRICT MORES OF CHINESE SOCIETY, THE STIGMA OF HER PAST WOULD PREVENT HER FROM EVER BEING AN ACCEPTABLE WIFE. SHE GO OUT. SHE GO OUT! WHERE IS SHE? WHERE DOES SHE LIVE? SHE LIVES THERE. WHERE IS SHE? YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU WERE A GARDENER. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WANT MY MONEY BACK. HUH? I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I THOUGHT THE DEAL WAS THAT YOU TOLD ME YOUR STORY AND I PAID YOU. I DID. EXCEPT YOU, UH, YOU LEFT OUT ALL OF THAT, IT SEEMS. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE I GOT IT. I GOT IT. GIVE IT TO ME! SO, IS THERE ANYTHING-- MISTER, YOU PAID ME TO TALK AND I DID, AND THAT'S IT. GO GET LIFE. WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU TOLD ME THAT WAS THE TRUTH? I MEAN, I'M NOT ANGRY, I'M JUST-- IS THERE SOME LAW THAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH? ARE WE CLOSE? ARE WE FRIENDS? I THOUGHT THE DEAL WAS THAT-- I THOUGHT THE DEAL WAS THAT YOU'D-- PISS OFF! JEAN! JEAN! JEAN! OHH... UHH... AHH... UHH... I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? YOU HAVE THIS. I WANT TO HEAR YOUR... YOUR VERSION OF WHAT HAPPENED. THIS WAS THE SCHOOL THAT I USED TO GO TO. ONE DAY WE WERE IN THAT CORNER COPYING EACH OTHER'S HOMEWORK AND THEN LISTENING TO THE RADIO, AND...I LOOKED AT HIM-- WE WERE THIS CLOSE... AND WE JUST KNEW IT. WE WERE IN LOVE. AND THAT WAS IT. FROM THAT DAY ONWARDS, WE WERE TOGETHER EVERY SINGLE DAY. WE COULDN'T BE APART. MADLY IN LOVE. THIS IS THE BACK OF WILLIAM'S HOUSE. WHAT'S THAT? WE KEEP OUR SECRET LETTERS HERE. WE MEET SECRETLY HERE. WHY SECRETLY? BECAUSE WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO SEE EACH OTHER. WHY NOT? HIS FATHER DIDN'T LIKE IT. YOU SEE, HIS FATHER WORKED FOR A BIG COMPANY, AND ALL THE EMPLOYEES ARE FORCED TO SIGN A CONTRACT SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHINESE PEOPLE. ONE DAY I GOT LETTER FROM WILLIAM... SAYING THAT IT WAS ALL OVER. HOW DID YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT? I COULDN'T TAKE IT. I WENT MAD. I TRIED TO KILL MYSELF. I DRANK POISON. ONLY I DIDN'T DIE.

[PASSENGERS SPEAKING CHINESE] Newswoman: IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO A RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH IS GOING TO RESTRICT THE RIGHTS OF ASSEMBLY AND PROTEST IN HONG KONG, A 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT DOUSED HIMSELF WITH GASOLINE AND SET HIMSELF ON FIRE. BUT A RECENT SURVEY INDICATES THAT THE MAJORITY OF HONG KONG PEOPLE EXPECT BUSINESS TO CONTINUE AS USUAL AFTER THE HAND-OVER. THE CITY REMAINS ON THE MOVE AND ON THE MAKE, SEEMINGLY IN DENIAL OF HOW THINGS CHANGE. OR WILL THEY CHANGE? John: I USED TO WRITE ABOUT HONG KONG'S FUTURE, AS IF IT HAD A DEFINITE DIRECTION AND PREDICTABLE OUTCOME. BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS CITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHANGING. MAYBE...I WASN'T MEANT TO FIGURE YOU OUT. [GUITAR PLAYING, MAN WHISTLES] COME ON, LET'S GO. COME ON. Mary, on answering machine: JOHN? JOHN, ARE YOU THERE? JOHN? JOHN, IT'S MARY.
