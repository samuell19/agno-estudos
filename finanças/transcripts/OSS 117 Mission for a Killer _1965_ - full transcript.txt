I’ll carry on! I’ll see you at the bottom. Hello, Colonel! Not an easy man to see! Clark! What are you doing here? We needed some privacy. I suppose Smith sent you. From Washington with love. Your smile bodes ill. -Things bad? -Trouble in South America. Not interested! I’m on vacation. But you’ll love this. Meet you in an hour. Suite 232, Mont d’Arbois Hotel. Dames are not invited. Shame. General Moreno’s private jet blew up in flight. Vestiges of a bomb were found in the debris. Here’s a montage of newsreel and television news. Luckily the TV cameraman was on the spot. It all began well. Now look what happens. Wow, that’s incredible! Four bombs in a month is a bit much. Don’t you think? The authors of these crimes always die with their victims. -Yes. Suicide bombers. -Yes. But very strange. The bodies of these two terrorists have been identified. -They looked honest. -Yes. lrreproachable past, no political involvement. We think they were conditioned by a drug. -A drug that makes killers? -Yes. Criminal robots. -So they’re hypnotized? -It looks like it. What drug could it be? Mr. Smith hopes to ﬁnd out by sending our most perspicacious, most intelligent and most attractive agent. Who could that be? And the most modest! A certain OSS 117, alias Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath. Ring any bells? But I’m on vacation! I want to finish it in peace. You’ll see, Brazil is heavenly! Look, I’m not ready to go to heaven. Sorry, but there’s not a moment to lose. The navy plane leaves in the morning. You’ll go as a journalist, correspondent for the Associated World Press. That’s your cover. -Name of Hubert Delcroix. -Here’s your passport. -I’ve just met the woman of my dreams. -Again! You’ll meet one every night in Rio. You know our agent there? -Thomas Ellis! -Yes. Officially, correspondent for the same press agency. He has interesting stuff for you. -He’s leaving? -When you arrive. He’s been in Rio too long. The atmosphere’s unhealthy. OSS 117: MISSION FOR A KILLER Mr. Hubert Delcroix, please come to the information desk. Would Mr. Hubert Delcroix, a passenger from Paris on Flight R6023, please come to Information. Is it that father of 15? Maybe. Would Mr. Delcroix please come to the information desk. Would Mr. Hubert Delcroix, a passenger from Paris on Flight R6023... Mr. Delcroix, you’re being called to the information desk. Thank you. I’m sorry. I hope to see you again soon. Mr. Delcroix? Yes. Hubert. And you, miss? Consuela. Consuela Moroni. Please come with me. Your car is there. -Here are the keys. -Thank you. Where are we going? I’ll show you the way. Straight ahead. -Something worrying you? -No. Nothing. Maybe it’s travel fatigue, but you seem in a foul mood. What an idea, shouting my name all over the airport! Treating you as a simple tourist hid you from your adversaries. lt rather stripped me bare, though. I’d planned to arrive as the head of a family! So I saw! You like children? Yes. When their mommy’s pretty. -Do you have any children? -No. Not yet. Never mind. VVhy? I’d have probably loved them. Are you married? No. Not yet. -Good. -Why? Because you’re a pretty brunette with dark eyes. And, you know, it’s strange, but I always dream of pretty brunettes with dark eyes. You say that to all the women. What an idea! I only say that to brunettes with dark eyes. Go straight ahead to the port then turn left. Okay. Go straight ahead. The Spanish ship Estrella will be alongside. Mr. Ellis is waiting. -You’re not coming? -No. My instructions are to wait for you in the car. May I? See you later. They must have seen to him by now. No doubt. He won’t come now. Shall we go? Wait a while. WATCH OUT - DANGER No! It has to look like an accident. Bastard! The Copacabana Palace? -Keep going straight ahead. -Thank you. Last night, in an inexplicable car accident north of Bahia, likable reporter Thomas Ellis was seriously wounded. During the night, he was rushed by plane to the Hospital dos Bancarios in Rio. The name’s Hubert Delcroix. Room 227. -Would you take my luggage? -Yes, Mr. Delcroix. How do I get to the Hospital dos Bancarios? Take the first right, then straight ahead. It’s 15 minutes away. Thank you. Blood pressure holding. We’ll see to you. We’ll operate. Give him an injection of solucamphre. Good. You may go up. I’d like to see Mr. Thomas Ellis. Surgical nurses’ office, second floor. -Left-hand elevator. -Thank you. Sir! Where are you going? We’re together. -You’ve got some nerve! -Don’t be angry. I’m in a hurry. -You’re wasting time with me. -Pleasantly. Very pleasantly. It seems we have a mutual friend. Thomas Ellis. I found him and had him brought here. -Thanks from him. -It’s only natural. Miss? -Mr. Thomas Ellis, please. -He’s being operated on. Forceps. Another. Sponge. Shears. Open up and swab. Forceps. -I called the police. -I’ll fetch the intern. -Why not wait for the police? -I’ve no time to lose. I bet one doesn’t get bored with you around! You neither! I’m sure of it. I don’t understand what’s going on. You acted in self-defense. Why didn’t you wait for the police? l’ll confess everything. -l’m a gangster. -Well! And what’s your name? I fear I may disappoint you. I’m not very well known yet. Come now. No false modesty! What’s your name? Hubert Delcroix. Hubert Delcroix? I knew it. -You know my name? -Yes. l have something for you. -From Ellis? -Yes. Here’s a set of keys... and a notebook he asked me to give you upon arrival. So that’s done. Thank you. By the way, miss... what’s your name? Ana Maria Sulza. What role do you play in this business? None! Yesterday I didn’t know Mr. Ellis. He had an accident near our property. l was horseback riding along the road and heard an explosion. At the spot, I found a car totally mutilated and a badly injured man in the ditch. I attended to him and had him flown out. It was the least I could do. An explosion, you say? Was Ellis alone in the car? No. There was another man. He was killed outright. I’m sorry you’re mixed up in this business. -Why? -They might hurt you. -Who are “they”? -The ones who killed Ellis. -I don’t... -Believe me. Be very careful. Avoid leaving your house. Don’t worry. I’m well guarded. I’ll pick you up for dinner. What about not going out? With others! I’ll watch over you. See you later. Who are you? If, as I assume, you are Mr. Delcroix, you should know Mr. Ellis had a secretary. And this key proves that it’s me. You are Consuela Moroni. How do you know? I guessed. It’s odd. You don’t look at all Brazilian. My father’s Brazilian. My mother’s Swedish. That explains everything. What are you here for? The radio said Mr. Ellis had been killed, so I came straight here. Yes. Where did he keep his documents? In a safe. But I don’t know where it is. I do. But I don’t have the key. Mr. Ellis always carried it on him. Is it this one? Yes, but why only two keys? There were three of them. -And the third key opened the safe? -Yes. Then I must be going. l have to ﬁnd out where that key is. -Any other clues? -Yes. If anything happened to Mr. Ellis, l was to give you his contact in Rio, Enrique Salerno, whom he trusted implicitly. What is this Salerno’s official occupation? Photographer. He has a souvenir shop at the cable car station on Sugarloaf Mountain. I’ll go there right now. He’s been away since yesterday. -When’s he back? -Tomorrow night. But when he hears of Mr. Ellis’s murder, he’ll come right back and call here. That’s why I risked coming. You did right. I’d like to ask you a favor. -Yes? -It’s like this. I’m getting scared. As soon as you hook up with Salerno, have me ﬂown out. -I promise. -Thanks. If anything happens, call me at the Copacabana Palace. I’ll call you tonight. You might have news of Salerno. -Hello? - Oh, it’s you. - You’re at Ellis’s? -Yes. You can come. Behind is Copacabana. This is the best view of Rio. Sir. A drink? -Your finest champagne. -Very good, sir. Thank you. You seem preoccupied tonight. What’s the matter? My brother Miguel called earlier from Bahia. The police have finished investigating Mr. Ellis’s car. And? They found grenade shrapnel in the car and in the passenger’s body. His name was Sanbez. Looks like he detonated it. As for Ellis, are you sure I have everything? Of course! Wasn’t there another key on the ring? You think I took it? A simple question. -l’m sick of your questions! -I say, you have quite a temper! -What’s that? -Mexican champagne. Got any whiskey? Portuguese scotch. Bring us two Brazilian vodkas. Yes, sir. What a beat! Nothing is more marvelous than our music. The little kid’s terriﬁc! How’s your first day in Rio been? Each Brazilian girl is like a breath of fresh air. -Have you met many? -One too many. -Thanks! -Did I say l was talking about you? What a temper! Brazilian girls are like that. You don’t look typically Brazilian. -My father’s Brazilian... -And your mother’s Swedish. Not at all. She’s NonNegian. Skoal! Skoal. They’ve arrived. They’re getting out of the car. You can come. -Would you get me 24-44-66? -Yes, sir. Hello? - Hubert Delcroix here. -Oh, it’s you. Salerno called me. He’ll be at his father’s shop at 11:00 tomorrow. Thanks. I’ll be there. -Do you want me to come? -No need. -I’m off to bed. - Good night. Good-bye. You must go. He could come. He has the key. No. I won’t leave you alone. You’d better. I’m off to Washington tomorrow and you can join me there soon. -Do you do this often? -All the time. No doubt that’s why I’m still alive. Forgive me. It’s terrible. Those men at the port... I hopped in a passing truck and escaped. And poor Mr. Ellis’s murder! It’ll be my turn next. I’m scared. I spent the day hiding at a friend’s. Why didn’t you stay? You were safe. My friend works at night. I didn’t want to be alone. I preferred to wait here. I’m scared. Get me out of Rio on the first ﬂight. That plane’s going to be packed! I’ll try to get you a seat tomorrow. For tonight, I’ll get you a room. No! It’s just that I can’t be alone. Sit on my bed. I’ll give you something. Take these two tablets. They’ll calm you down. Go away or I’ll ﬁre! -Hello. Copacabana Palace? - Yes? Mr. Delcroix. It’s Miss Moroni. - Mr. Delcroix? -It’s urgent! Don’t bank on him. Who’s there? Thank you. Sorry to wake you but I have an important appointment. Don’t get up. You’re safe here. I’ll be back soon. PUNCHES AND YELLING TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS SLEEP WITH SNORING WHISTLING BATHING SOUNDS He’s in the bathroom. Shall we go? -Where is he? -He went that way. Drop your guns! Back up. Can you gift wrap? Yes. Show us your talents, then. Your turn. You’re going to have a nice nap. Breathe through the nose. -Can we do the room? -No. Madam is sleeping. -Enrique Salerno? -Yes. Do you recognize this key ring? Looks like you’re one short. Dead right. You know where it is? Yes. Mr. Ellis left it with me while he was away. -Here it is. -Thank you. Come with me. I’m not the only one interested in this safe. You stay here. If we get visitors, send out an SOS. How? Press down several times on this. I’ll get your signal. Okay. Hands up! The number you dialed... The bastard! Call this a five-star hotel? I’m having breakfast... and water rains down on my head! What? How dare you? I warn you, this’ll cost you big-time! Bastards! Dried flowers in a safe? You’d hope for better. It’s not that bad, believe me. Think about it. What are narcotics made from? Plant extracts. Perfectly right. From plant extracts. That’s why. This will lead us to the Indians who extract the alkaloids. And from there to the sellers. Yes, Ellis was right. But we can’t go in. There’s a “Do not disturb” sign! Give me your passkey. Switchboard? Call the police. Quick! Is this where Ellis’s car exploded? Yes. Near the fazenda of Miguel and Ana Maria Sulza. And this red circle is the territory of the Galipalos Indians? Yes. Their witch doctor makes the weirdest narcotics. That’s right. That’s surely where Ellis wanted to go. Go on, get in! Bad luck. I’d have liked to chat to them for a second. Let me go, you brutes! I’m going to Bahia to take over Ellis’s investigation. -Thank you, Mr. Salerno. -You’re welcome. -Good-bye. -Ciao! Could I please see Miss Sulza? My name is Delcroix. -Of course, sir. Come in. -Thank you. This way. Come in. Come on in! -What are they doing? -I don’t know. What is this? You’re crazy! The bastard! Hubeﬂ? What are you doing here? What’s going on? Have I been ill? Don’t worry. You’re fine now. All I remember is you bringing me home earlier. No, Ana Maria. That was last night. Don’t be silly. It was just a little while ago! See for yourself. It’s incredible. What did I do all that time? I have no idea. But if I told you what you wanted to do... you’d be very surprised. I want to know! You almost killed us with a grenade. What? Look. Going to heaven with you is compensation... but... we’ve got plenty of time. Hubert, tell me the truth! They drugged you, Ana Maria. Like the other victims. Look at your arm. You still have the needle mark. That’s awful. Listen to me... and try to remember. What happened after I left you? Wait... Yes... I tried to close my door. It stuck... That’s all I remember. I’m sorry! It’s okay. The main thing is, the plan failed. You see, all you needed was the antidote and you’re well again. Now what do we do? Promise me not to tell anyone. It’ll give me more chance to find the culprits. I promise. Now we’re off to Bahia, where they killed Ellis. With your help, I hope to track them down. And... I can watch over you. 520 MILES So here we are in Salvador de Bahia. Is your fazenda far from here? No. We’ll be home in an hour. They just passed by. Fine. We’ll be ready. Places, quickly! Hurry! Faster! Now go and hide. Here they come! Quick! We won’t pass! Shut your window. -The tank’s on fire. Stop! -I wish I could! Where’s this car? They went through the flames. Their tires were on fire. Catch them! They won’t get far. You can say that again! Stay here. That’s the third time you’ve saved my life. How can I thank you? By helping me carry the bags to our new car. -They fell into your trap! -Yes. I’ve never been so scared. Why? I was there. That’s true. Here we are. There’s my brother Miguel on his horse. -How are you? -Well. And you? Fine. -Welcome. -Glad to meet you. -Come and freshen up. -With pleasure! My sister told me you want to see the Galipalos tribe. I called our cousin and friend, Leandro Oliveira, who knows the forest well. He’s like a brother to us. He’ll take you to the tribe. He invited us over. We’ll leave later. Those buildings are part of Leandro’s fazenda. It’s huge: one million hectares and over 100,000 head of cattle. Those are the grounds to his house. He’s waiting on the strip. My dear friends. -Dear Ana Maria. -Leandro! -Okay? -This is Hubert Delcroix. Very glad to meet you. -Miguel. -Leandro. You’re Ana Maria and Miguel’s friend. The finest recommendation there is. I’m thrilled to meet you. If you’d come with me... -A good ﬁight? -Yes. -Not too tired? -Not at all. My friends, my house is your house. I’m so happy to have you all here tonight. What a fine occupation, that of reporter, Mr. Delcroix. On the lookout for the unknown. And the truth! Yes. But what prompted you to report on our Indian tribes? I’ve always been a keen student of primitive races. I quite understand. I’ve always wondered why medicine men in tribes we call “savage” know more about nature’s secrets than our scientists. It is incredible. Yes. It’s astounding that these primitives succeeded in making poisons... drugs and narcotics whose effects amaze us and for which we have no equivalent. They’re jealously guarded secrets, handed down to generations of medicine men over centuries. Our scholars have much to learn from them. We go to the moon while they discover the earth. Thanks to you, I’ll meet the Indians. And... with luck, uncover the mystery that seems to us like magic. I’ll be glad to be of service. We can leave tomorrow. Not that I want to cut short your stay... but for the Galipalos Indians, tomorrow is the start of their annual feasts. It’s a sight worth seeing. Won’t prying eyes be unwelcome? No. Leandro knows their chief. We’ll be treated with deference. Do they still practice human sacrifice? These cruel practices are still customary. In our day, it’s insane. Can nothing prevent it? No, nothing. They’re not really put to death. The victims are consenting. Consenting? How can that be? Impossible! Not really. Those flowers you showed me, Mr. Delcroix, are those of the peyote plant, whose sap has a strange power. It totally depersonalizes the recipient, turning them into a kind of robot, perfectly obedient. They may lose control, okay, but what makes them act? With this drug, the subjects live a waking dream, leaving them at the mercy of the tribe’s witch doctor. You see them walk freely to blazing bonfires and climb on. There they burn, without apparent suffering, as if in a state of grace. That mustn’t stop us from drinking to Mr. Delcroix’s health! For you, Ana Maria? The same, please. Look. Very funny! -And this? -It’s amusing. We’re not ﬁying north? No. The Galipalos tribe is slightly to the west. We won’t be able to land. There’s a little clearing my pilot knows. You can trust him. He’s only killed 27 people! What? And that was during the war, as a fighter pilot! There are no Indians in this region! What is all this? You’ve gone mad! -I’m not mad. -What? -Miguel! No, Hubert! -Don’t move! Not mad, nor drugged. It was my mission or friendship. You dare threaten me! One day you’ll understand. All of you, I hope. When our cause wins out. I was ordered to kill Delcroix. I didn’t. I was ordered to kill all who helped him. I didn’t. Isn’t that proof of my friendship? You must join us... and understand our action, our ideal! A murderer’s ideal! Nothing great is achieved without violence. Brave men must seize power. Only the cause matters! We must win. That’s all. We’re going to an unexplored region of the forest. The HQ of our organization. You have one chance of survival. Join us. Or I’ll lose my friends twice. Freeze or you’re dead! Look out! Let her go, Leandro! Let go or I fire! Let her go! If you shoot, we’ll both fall. Drop your gun or I’ll drop her! Do as he says. Drop the gun. Duty officer. -Duty ofﬁcer! -Sir! I announced our arrival by radio. -The staff awaits in the boardroom. -Let’s go, then. Stand aside. Attention! A man who elects to sacrifice himself can change the world. One ideal, one continent, one leader, one action! The elite must stand together. Then and only then will we beat the demagogues who are leading the world to ruin. If not, it is they who will crush us. Our fight is your fight. Soon our liberated continent will be the cradle of a new world. A cradle built on coffins. Any ﬁght has its victim. Our fate is at stake. We are the future. Millions of men died for such a future. Many died making the pyramids, and they’re made of stone. History bows down to victors. Losers are monsters, winners are heroes. History recalls such heroes end up at the end of a rope. Your insolence... I want to ask Leandro a question. I’m listening. You, a so-called friend... think we’re capable of being murderers’ accomplices! You betrayed friends! Miguel, try to understand. In my house in Rio, those men didn’t hesitate to drug me and sacrifice me. You? It can’t be, Carlos? -She’s lying! -No! He killed several of our men. Yes. In self-defense. I said we should kill him. -You don’t have the right. -Silence! Mr. Delcroix, here’s the deal. Give us the list of CIA agents on this continent... or you’ll be conditioned. We’ll turn you into our own killer. Ana Maria Sulza will be your first victim. You can’t, Carlos! Decide before tomorrow. Take the prisoners away. Go on. Follow me. Leandro, you’ll soon follow us. You’ve just shown you’re still capable of pity. It’s a weakness they won’t allow. Leave us. I put all my contacts at your disposal. I made you what you are. You did nothing for me. You militated for a cause. -Carlos, I demand... -Demand? Yes. I demand that Miguel and Ana Maria be released. Are you losing it? You’d betray our cause to protect your friends? If they don’t come over to us, I must eliminate them. They know too much. A revolutionary has no friends. No friends! Remember that. Hands behind your head! Open the door. Inside. Follow me. Come on, let’s free the Indians. Machado? Carlos experiments on them, often fatally. You are free. Where’s the ammunition? I’ll show you. Let’s go. Come on! Don’t make any noise! You, come here. You, come here. Quick! Take this. What do we do? Find me a safety fuse and a detonator. Things will be better once we’ve blown this up! I’ll go to the command and try to call by radio. -I’ll see to the guards. -Okay. Who goes there? Set your explosives and join me. Shelter at the foot of that rock. I’II join Hubert. Come on. No noise. HQ to Bahia Province, urgent call, come in. HQ to Bahia Province, urgent call. Do you read me? HQ to Bahia Province, urgent. Come in! Roger. Hostages will be killed in a rebel camp. Set the charges there. Hands up. Light the fuses. The guards are dead. Our men are boxed in. The prisoners have been freed. The munitions have blown. Conﬁrming AX36B, Airborne Intervention Squad, Bahia Province, arriving in a few minutes. Keep channel open. -Leandro betrayed us. -Yes. If we want our cause to survive, we mustn’t be captured. We’ll go down the river in an Indian canoe and take refuge with good friends. Hand me a gun. She’ll be our prize hostage. Let me go! Help! Let go of me! Hubert! Come on, move it! You brute! Provide covering fire! FonNard. Charge! Drive me up there as fast as possible. To my friends. At the camp. Leandro, you’re hurt. I saw Carlos and Karl... kidnapping Ana Maria. Where did they go? There’s only one way out of here. The river. But you won’t catch them. They’ve got a head start. What can we do? There’s only one solution and it depends on you. Stay with him. I’ll try to find Ana Maria. Can you forgive me, Miguel? Yes. Hubert!
