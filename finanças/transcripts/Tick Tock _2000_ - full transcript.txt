- That was great, honey. - Think that'll hold ya 'til I get back? - Do you really have to stay overnight? - Well I promised Anne. I haven't seen her in almost two years. Rachel. She's my only child. All right? All right, that's a good girl. I'll be back tomorrow evening. - What? - Hi. It's me. - Did he leave yet? - No, not yet. He's just in the shower. - So are we on for tonight or what? - I don't know. I was thinking maybe we should wait. - Wait for what? If you back out on me again, just rip up my phone number because I don't want to hear it anymore. - Carla, don't be like that. - I'm serious, Rachel. I've had it. Now, are we on for tonight or not? - Thank you. So what're your plans for the weekend? - Hangin' out with Carla. - Hanging. Hanging out with Carla. How many times do I have to tell you when you slur your speech, you sound illiterate? - I know. I know. Sorry. - When are you gonna realize that hanging out with Carla is one of the reasons your self-improvement's been so difficult. - She's my best friend. - I know. But do me a favor, leave your wallet at home. I don't want you lending her anymore money. And whatever you do, don't wear that lace outfit. - Oh, but it's so pretty. - It's tacky. It's cheap-looking. - Cost near $800. - Expensive doesn't mean discerning. Remember? - You're gonna. You're going to miss your plane. - See ya tomorrow evening. - There you are. I thought you were gonna chicken out again. - I'll get us some more drinks. - Do you think that's a good idea? - I wouldn't do it if it wasn't a good idea. Would you sit down and let me worry about things and try and act like you're having fun? - All right. What do we do first? - Just relax and look cute. I'll do everything else. Hey, can I get two Stoly kamikazes for that table right there? - I kinda have my hands full right now. - The quicker they get there, the bigger your tip. - Do me a favor, huh? Those drinks that lady ordered, put on my tab, all right? - Oh, the drinks have already been taken care of, ma'am, by the gentleman at the bar. - I can't... - Sh. - Howdy. I'm Travis. - Hi Travis. I'm Carla and this is Rachel. - It's a pleasure. Hey, y'all mind if I join ya? - So, tell me Travis, are you a real cowboy or do you wear that hat just 'cause you think it looks good on you? - It does look good on me. Doesn't it? - Yeah, I think so. - So you wanna dance? - No, I couldn't. - It's just a dance, Rachel. - What the hell? - It's your first time here, right? - How can you tell? - Well your dress for one thing. I mean it obviously cost about a month's wages for most everybody in here. - My husband bought it for me. - See that's another thing. I'll wager you're not the only woman in here who's married, but you are the only one who hasn't bothered to remove her wedding band. - Hey, why should I? I'm just here to have a couple of drinks with my friend, nothing more. - So he does all right, this husband of yours? - He's a potato broker. - What? - He travels between here and Idaho Falls, buyin' and sellin' potatoes, decidin' which ones will go to restaurants or supermarkets, or become potato chips, or frozen like in TV dinners. - And he got rich doin' that? - His family's worth millions. - Because of potatoes? - So I come up from Texas for that rodeo last April and then I met a girl and I decided to stay for awhile. - So where is she? - We split up. Anyway, I've been punchin' cows up to Gentry Ranch 'til I can get me a grubstake. You know, get back on the road. - I'm takin' off. - Oh, so soon? - It's one o'clock in the morning and I've got a long drive ahead of me. Here's your purse. - You know, maybe I should go, too. - Rachel. Well, don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Is there anything you wouldn't do? - I reckon not. - Well, what now? - What do you mean? - You didn't leave with your friend. - And I'm not leavin' with you either. Bakersfield's a small town. We've already given everyone here more than enough to talk about. - All right, fair enough, but... - What? - Just because we don't leave together, doesn't mean we can't end up being together. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. - Do you know where Pioneer Village is? - Yeah. - You leave first. If I'm not there in 20 minutes, I'm not coming. - I was afraid you weren't gon' come. - I almost didn't. - So this is Pioneer Village, huh? - Our one and only true tourist trap. Don't tell me you've never been here before? - Well I've passed by it a few times. - Well come on then. - Is it open? - It is for us. Come on. Oh I used to love coming out here at night like this when no one was around. And this is my favorite spot. Beale Clock Tower. It used to sit smack-dab in the middle of town square, but it got damaged in the quake of '52. So they dragged it out here with all the other landmarks and relics. Whenever things got too tough at home, I'd come out here and hide for awhile. - If I had your money, I don't think things ever'd get too tough for me. - I wasn't born rich. I married it. At least that's what his daughter says. - What're you doin' out here with me, huh? I mean you were gonna leave with your friend and she whispered somethin' in your ear and you decided to stay. - She double dared me. - What? - It's how she used to get me to do all kinds of crazy things when I was a kid. Now it's just sort of a runnin' joke. - I double dare you. She's gone. You get what you wanted? - Yeah and then some. - I still can't believe I let you talk me into this. - Didn't look like you were suffering too much. - Nope. I reckon not. - I'm serious Rachel, I've had it. Now, are we on for tonight or not? - Okay, great. I'll see you there at eight o'clock. - I missed you. Mm. - God, I missed you, too. Now we got the whole weekend together. - Not this weekend. That was Rachel on the phone. Her hubby's going out of town, so back to Bakersfield for us. - I don't know about this, Carla. I mean, I know we talked about it and all but... - But what? - Look, I'm already a two-time loser. This thing backfires, I could spend the rest of my life in prison. - It's not gonna backfire. It's not one of your stupid liquor store hold-ups. You know I've been plannin' this thing for two years. What's the matter? Don't love me anymore? - You know I love you but. - But? I'm the best you ever had. Say it. - Carla. - Say it. - You're the best I ever had but. Since I am the one takin' all the risk. - Mm-hm? - 50 50 don't seem hardly fair. - Okay. How 'bout 60 40? - I was thinkin' 70 30. - Hey, can I get two Stoly kamikazes for the table right there? - I kinda have my hands full right now. - Well the quicker they get there, the bigger your tip. Well, don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Is there anything you wouldn't do? - I reckon not. Don't bother, I got it. Thanks. - What are you doing here? How'd you find me? - What? No, you were great last night? Nothing? - You were great last night. Now what do you want? - I realize that this is an awkward moment. So I'll just go 'head and start. You don't want your husband to see those pictures. Gonna cost you $100,000. - What? I don't have that kind of money. - Come on, Rachel. Don't bullshit a bullshitter. Look, this thing right here. I bet it's worth $100,000 all by itself. - Didn't last night mean anything to you? - Yeah. $100,000. I'm right about this, ain't I? - It don't matter whether you're right or not. It's not mine. None of it is. That's what I'm trying to tell you. It's my husband who has the money, not me. - Well, then how 'bout I just take this, call it my grubstake? - No, don't. Holden will notice it's missin'. My jewelry. - What about it? - I'll hock some of my jewelry. I don't wear it that often. Maybe Holden won't notice. - There. Now that wasn't so tough, was it? Now you see what you can accomplish when you put your mind to it? Well, I don't wanna overstay my welcome. Besides, you better get dressed. Get on down to the pawn shop. - You expect me to do it now? - This ain't layaway, darlin'. I want my money by tonight. Oh and you can go ahead and keep those pictures. I got plenty of copies. - So how'd it go? - Well she said she couldn't pay. So then I threatened to take that stupid tusk of hers and started to walk off with the damn thing, just like you told me to. - And? - And. She's gonna hock her jewelry. - See, I told ya she'd cave if you took that thing. It's Holden's favorite piece. - Oh yeah? - Yes. - Speakin' of favorite pieces. - Are you sure you didn't enjoy it with her? - No, no, no. Pure torture. I was in agony the whole time. - Well, I think I better check it just to be sure it's okay. - Well if you think you ought to. - Hello? - So, how'd it go at the pawn shop? - I got your money. - Great. I can pick it up in about an hour. - No. I gotta go out. I can't meet you 'til tonight. - All right, fine, tonight then. - And I don't want you comin' by here anymore. I wanna meet you someplace else where no one will see us. - Like where? - The Gottchalk's parking lot at 10 o'clock. The north end where no one ever parks. - What you got up your sleeve there, Rachel? She wants me to meet her in a parking lot tonight at 10. - That's fine. What's she gonna do? - All right. I'll meet you. But I'm telling you right now, you try anything... - You just be sure and bring the negatives. - She's up to somethin'. - She's just playin' it safe. - No, no, no, no, it's more than that. - Well if it is, I'm sure she's left me 20 messages already. - I hope you're right. - Look, I've known Rachel since the fifth grade. We're best friends. She tells me everything. She's up to something, I'll know as soon as I call her back. - Reminds me of that ol' sayin'. - Which one? - With friends like you, who needs enemies. - Oh, you know, stop you're breakin' my heart. She always lands on her feet. She was head cheerleader, homecoming queen. She went out with the star quarterback. - Damn, I bet you were a wild-ass in high school. - Well Rachel's daddy didn't like me much. Thought I was a bad influence. - Yeah and were ya? - Every chance I got. - Uh huh. - That's why she hung out with me. She could do any crazy thing she wanted and blame me for it. You know I used to go out with her husband. That's right. I was Holden Avery's girl until I introduced him to Rachel. - Tough break. - Yeah. - So as far as I'm concerned, she owes me. - Thank you. - I checked the odometer. Hey, take it easy, will ya? I just fixed that thing. - I'll be back tomorrow evening. - Hi, it's me. No, not yet. He's just in the shower. I don't know. I was thinkin' maybe we should wait. - Fairfield Investigations. - This is Holden Avery. She's on the phone with him right now. - Mr. Avery, I've been tracking your wife for almost a year now and if she's got some stud in her corral, she's keepin' him well hid because I haven't caught her with no one. So far. - Well maybe she's just a little more devious than you give her credit for. - Well maybe, but my motto is, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. - Quaint. She'll be dropping me off at the airport in less than an hour. Pick her up there. - You're the boss. - Good. I want you to keep her under constant surveillance 'til I get back. Now my appointment calendar's downstairs. What time we meeting tomorrow night? 10:30, your place. - Fine. I want a detailed report. - The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of passengers only. No parking. - We'd like to thank all you guest riders and stragglers for hanging out with us tonight. Have a good night and drive home safe. - Thank you. No, no, no, keep the change. Rachel? Where are ya? Rachel? I don't believe this. She knew I was comin' home tonight. - Hey, it's Carla. Obviously I'm very busy, so leave me a message. - Carla, this is Holden. I assume Rachel's with you. Have her give me a call as soon as you get this message. Oh my god. Carla. - You're late. Where were you? - Where do you think? - Then he's dead? - And Travis' fingerprints are on the photos and the murder weapon. - He's out in the middle of nowhere without an alibi. - How 'bout you? - He was still here, scribblin' on his notepad when you showed up. - Perfect. Perfect. He should be finding the body any minute. When the police get there and see the photographs, they're gonna think that Travis tried to blackmail Holden, and when Holden refused, he killed him. - Are you sure they won't suspect me? I mean after all I'm the one inheritin' all the money. - Holden hired the detective, not you. He's gonna say that you were sittin' at the bar having a drink at the time of the murder. - Did you really do it naked? - Well bloody clothes are hard to get rid of. It took me two minutes to hose off the evidence and get dressed. - That's what Holden gets for not trustin' me, huh? - Yeah, he was even obliging enough to leave a message on my machine. You have the perfect alibi. - We're really gonna get away with it, aren't we? - It's too bad about Travis, though. He's a great lay, isn't he? - Yeah. You were right about that. - But not as good as me. Right? Say it. Say it. - Not as good as you. No one's ever been as good as you. - Oh, the drinks have already been taken care of, ma'am, by the gentleman at the bar. - Carla, I don't think I can go through with this. - You can and you will. I'm the one who has to do the hard part. All you have to do is sleep with him. - No, I can't. I can't, Carla. I can't. - Sh sh sh. - Howdy. I'm Travis. - Here's your purse. - Maybe I should go, too. - Rachel. You're doin' great. Don't let me down now, okay? Besides, he's a great lay. - Can I get you another round, ladies? It's last call. - No thanks. I think we're gonna call it a night. Okay, let's go get the tragic news. - Well, where is everybody? - I don't know. This place should be swarming with cops. Unless the detective didn't find the body. - You remembered to leave the door unlocked, right? It's locked, Car. It's locked. - It was open when I left. Don't touch anything. We have to come back in the morning. Let the maid find the body. - Where is he? - I don't know. He was right here. - Well maybe he wasn't dead. Maybe after you left, he managed to call an ambulance. - Oh right, and they tidied up before they took him to the hospital? There was blood everywhere and that thing was right there. - Well what happened? - I don't know. Just let me think, okay? - Carla, I got a real bad feelin' about this. - Hello? - Travis? - Carla, where the fuck are you? - I got restless and I went for a drink. Why? How did it go? - I told you that bitch was up to something. - What do you mean? - She didn't show, Carla. So I went out to her house. Son of a bitch, I knew we couldn't trust her. Rachel? Come out, come out wherever you are. I think I pretty much got the blood out of everything except I couldn't get it out of this oriental rug and a couple of files. Then I dumped his body out by the lake where we go skinny-dipping. Made it look like a mugging. I took the rug and the files and I burned them in my barbecue pit. - Nobody saw you? - No, no, I don't think so. But some guy saw my truck in their driveway. - What guy? - I don't know what guy. Some guy. I think he saw my license plate. Oh man. I am so screwed. - Don't panic, okay? I'll figure out something. Just sit tight 'til I get there, okay? - Just hurry, all right. Hey. - Hm? - I love you. - I love you, too. - What did he say? - We gotta get out to the lake. Come on and grab his legs. - Oh my god, look at his head. - Don't be such a priss. You knew I was gonna bash him. - I know, but how many times? - I wasn't exactly keeping count. Now will you get down here and help me? - Ugh. - Oh come on. - I just take it? - Yeah. Go. - Ah. - Don't worry about your pants. Just go. Come on. - God. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay. What's going on? Why won't it close? - Okay, wait, wait. Oh. His finger's stuck in the lock. I think we broke it. - What, the lock or his finger? - This ain't funny, Carla. What're we doin' here, Carla? What the hell are we doin'? - Would you keep your eyes on the road? You're swerving all over hell's half-acre. - You said that nothing could go wrong. You said absolutely nothing could go wrong. - Nothing has yet. Okay, you still have an air-tight alibi at the time of the murder. All we have to do is get Holden's body back to where it was so that the maid can find it in the morning. It's even better than we planned. - Better? Better? How could this possibly be better? - That detective saw Travis' car in your driveway, which puts him smack-dab at the scene of the crime. Okay? He's gonna fry for the murder. Not you. - You really think it's gonna work? - Yes, Rachel. Trust me, okay? I've got everything under control. - Okay. - Don't panic. Just don't. Don't panic. Just pull over to the side of the road and we'll just see what they want. - Evenin', Deputy. - Ma'am. May I see your driver's license and registration? - Here's my license. And here's my registration. - Thank you, ma'am. Mrs. Avery? - Mm-hm. - Now the reason I pulled you over is you were weaving quite a bit back there. Have you ladies been drinkin' tonight? - Well... - We had a drink at a bar, but it was a long time ago. - All the same, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car, ma'am. Back here, ma'am, away from the road. - She's not drunk, if that's what you're thinking. - Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to be quiet. Now Mrs. Avery, I want you to put your feet together and stand with your arms outstretched like this. - Like this? - That's fine. Now I want you to lean your head back and close your eyes. Now, I want you to bend your right arm and touch the tip of your nose with your index finger. Okay, now your left arm. - She did it. She passed, right? - Mrs. Avery, I'd like for you to do one more thing for me. I'd like for you to let your friend drive just to be safe. - Of course. - Whatever you say, officer. - Whoa. Whoa. Hold on a minute. - Yes sir? - There's somethin' stickin' out of your trunk. - Oh yeah. That's a. It's just an old shower curtain. It's nothing. - Well maybe so, but it's hanging over this one taillight. That could be a hazard. You best pop it back inside. - I have to get the key. God. There ya go. Have a good night. - Ma'am. Can I give ya a hand with that, ma'am? - No, no. It's no problem. We don't wanna be any more trouble. - It's no trouble really. Looks like you got it. - Yeah. Yeah, looks like it. Have a goodnight. How ya doin', you okay? - I think I peed my pants. - I know I peed my pants. Here we go. Okay. Okay, you get the door. I'll get the trunk. - Daddy? - Anne. What are you doing here? - Is my dad with you? - Flight 501 from Bakersfield is now arriving at gate two. - Hey Daddy. - Anne. You didn't have to meet me here. I told you, we're having lunch tomorrow. - I know. I just thought that since we haven't seen each other in so long, we'd have dinner tonight too. - I have an appointment with an attorney in less than an hour. - All night? - Then I have another appointment. - With who? - With whom. - Whom. - Look, I'm registered at the Regent. So come by tomorrow around one o'clock. - Dad... - Anne, please. Do as I ask. Please. I already know it's bad. Just need to know how bad. - We're making new breakthroughs every day, discovering new treatments... - Doctor, I don't need the inspirational speech. I just need to know how long I have. - Three to six months. - At least get a second opinion. Have you talked to Dr. Medina back home? - No. I don't want Rachel to know about this. - Why not? - Because I intend to divorce her before I die. - What? - It's the only way I can leave everything to you without her being able to contest it. - Daddy, I don't care about your money. - Yeah, but I do. She's been having an affair. - With whom? - I don't know yet. But I think it's been going on since before we were married. - Are you sure? - I've suspected it for a long time. And just as soon as I can prove it, the prenuptial allows me to dump her without giving her one red cent. - Daddy, this is crazy. Why can't you just stay and visit for just a couple of days? - I have an important meeting, one I cannot afford to miss. I'll call you in a few days, when everything's settled. - Daddy? I love you. - Believe it or not. I love you, too. - Hi. When's your next flight to Bakersfield? Still no answer. That's it, I'm calling the police. - They won't do anything until he's missing for 24 hours. I'm sure he's fine. - Then why doesn't he answer the phone? - Well maybe he's just really busy or maybe the meeting's not even in his office. If it'll make you feel better, we'll take a drive down to his office and check on him. - That's a good idea. That's a good idea. - Actually, I think that somebody should stay here in case he calls or comes by. - Yeah. Okay. - Come on, Rachel. - Now what're we doin'? - I've got an idea. It's even better than we planned. Oh just shut up and drive. I'll tell ya on the way. - So what's the plan? - First we have to go back to the bar and get my car. Then, you can follow me out to Travis' cabin, but turn off your headlights and stay back so he doesn't see you. He's probably been drinking and he's bound to be freaked out 'cause I've been gone so long. He'll wanna know where the hell have you been, Carla? And I'll tell him my battery died or something and it took me forever to get a jump. And then I'll say something like. It's freezing. Come on, let's go inside. Once we're inside, you pull up and park out of sight over by the generator shed. And then sneak up to the front of the cabin on foot. There you'll see a wheelbarrow and a shovel. You can use the wheelbarrow to move Holden's body from your trunk to the back of Travis' jeep. And don't worry, it won't be locked. It never is. But first, use the shovel to scrap up his fender and side panel and be sure you don't make too much noise. Then go find a phone booth. Make an anonymous 911 call. Give them Travis' license plate number and say you saw him hit a parked car and take off. I'll get Travis into bed and then get myself out of there before the cops show up. How much of that have you had? - About this much. - Well maybe you should lie down and try and get some sleep. - What are you stupid? I'm about this close to the gas chamber right now. - Well you dumped the body and you wiped up all the evidence, right? Then you've got nothing to worry about. If the cops go after anybody, they're gonna go after Rachel. She's the one with motive. I mean you've never even met the man. - What about the guy who saw my truck? - What about him? You're not the only guy in Bakersfield who drives a jeep. - Hey genius, he saw my license plate. - He made a mistake. You were here with me all night. It's his word against ours. - Yeah right. You got all the answers, don't you? - Sometimes. - Oh you should've seen him, baby. The way his skull was all caved in. It was a god-awful sight. - It's okay. It's over now, okay? It's gonna be fine. - The man is dead, Carla. It's not gonna be fine. - Yes it is. I'll take care of it, I promise. Okay? - Carla. - Wait. What the hell are you doing? What are you trying to ruin everything? - Is he dead? - No. No thanks to you. - You had to screw him one last time, didn't you? - Don't be stupid. I was just trying to wear him out so he'd pass out quicker. - Don't give me that shit. You may get away with treating your men like this, but I won't stand for it. Do you hear me? - Yeah, I hear you. You sound like a jealous old harping wife. - You just remember who's inheriting all the money. - You just remember who set this whole thing up, who went to every stinkin' tractor pull and rodeo looking for just the right guy. Do you know how many assholes I had to let slobber all over me until I finally found Travis? - Yeah and I'm sure it was a real sacrifice for someone with your high moral upbringing. - What's that supposed to mean? - You put out for every boy in high school, including your own brothers. - I don't need this shit. - Carla. Carla, I'm sorry. Okay? I didn't mean it. You know that I didn't. The money doesn't mean anything to me. I'm sorry. - Well let's go get Holden. Jesus Christ. - Now what? - Good enough. Okay. You check the road from here to the cabin and I'm gonna backtrack to your house. Holden's gotta be someplace in between. - Carla, I don't think I can keep this up. - Rachel. Don't fold on me now. We're almost home. We're almost home, okay? Please? - Carla? - Oh god. - You've reached Fairfield Investigations. You know what to do. Wait for it. - Mr. Fairfield, my name is Anne Avery. My father is missing and... - Hello, Miss Avery? - Mr. Fairfield. - Yes ma'am. What's this about your father missing? - That's right. For quite some time now. And it says here he had a 10:30 meeting with you? - He missed it. - I knew it. I knew it. Something's happened to him. - Well now, don't go jumpin' to conclusions. Where are ya? - My father's house. - All right, give me some time to get myself together and I'll be out there in less than an hour. - Thanks. Bye. - Little bit late for a ride in the country, isn't it Mrs. Avery? Your husband there looks dead on his feet. Hands, please. Hello, Sheriff's Office? Hello? Damn piece of shit. I just fixed this the other day. Ah, here we go. Yeah, hello? Yeah, I thought I lost you there for a second. My name's Clay Fairfield. I used to be on the force. Now I'm a P.I. I just uncovered a. - Carla, is that you? - Who'd you think it would be, Rachel? The goddamned auto club? - Is he dead? - Well I damn-near hit him at 50 miles an hour. - What're you doing? Let's get out of here. - Oh, you can drive like that? With your hands behind your back? Come on. - Oh my god. He was my alibi, Carla. You just ran over my alibi. - I already thought of that. He wrote everything down in this stupid little book. See look, it says he watched you at the bar until he went to meet Holden at 10:30. Oh my god. This is even better than we planned. - You keep saying that but I don't see it. - It says that Anne called and said Holden was missing. He suspects Travis. So when the cops find him, they'll think that Travis killed him and Holden both. We just have to make sure the cops find this. Ready? Okay, ready? One. Two, three. - You stinkin' bitch. You just been settin' me up this whole time. Well now I got myself a little bit of a dilemma, don't I? Should I kill you first? Or maybe you, huh? - Oh, way to go, Rachel. My grandmother could've knocked him out for longer than that. - This is my fault? - Well it's not my fault. - I cannot believe. - Oh, don't even start whining. - I let you talk me into this. - You know something? You are the biggest whiny spoiled brat. - Shut up. Shut the fuck up. - Don't, don't. Take his gun. Take his gun, Rachel. - Now what? - I don't know. Let me think. - Well make it fast. The sun's gonna be up any minute. - Okay, I got it. We'll take him deep into the woods and bury him where the cops will never find him. And then they'll just think that he got away. - Hey, come on, Carla. Look, you don't have to do that, all right? You don't have to do that. You just let me go, you'll never see me again, I promise. - Okay, just shut up. Just shut up. Do you think it'll work? - Yeah.
