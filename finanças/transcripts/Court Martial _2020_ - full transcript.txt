Have you ever faced death? Perhaps not. I have faced death many times. In war zones. In court martial chambers. Those moments of certain death which are killing may freeze the blood at times while at others they fill one with an adrenaline rush. I am Colonel Suraj Singh. I have killed many people. I have executed people. Settle down. Summon Jawan Ramchander. Jai Hind, sir. - Okay. Sit down, Ramchander. Major Ajay Puri. - Sir. Proceed with the court martial. - Right, sir. Sir, on 10th June Jawan Ramchander was on night duty. Two officers of the regiment, Capt Mohan Verma and Capt Kapoor were on their motorcycle passing by the guard house. Jawan Ramchander shot at them without any prior warning. Capt Mohan Verma died on the spot and Capt Kapoor was badly injured. Although he survived. He was admitted to the army hospital at once and he was operated on. As per the doctor's report, if the bullet had hit 2 inches lower to the heart, he would not have survived. This sequences of events tells us that Jawan Ramchander had pre-mediated this. He had already decided to kill these two officers. Therefore under the Indian Army act 69 and the Indian Penal Code, Section 302, today Jawan Ramchander is being court martialed. Sir. This general court martial is being conducted on the defendant for an intentional attack being of sound mind and body to kill Capt Verma and attempt to kill Capt Kapoor. Ramchander. Do you plead guilty? Sir. Sit down. Major Puri. - Sir. The first witness. Yes? Capt Bikash Roy. Before Major Puri presents his witnesses, I wish to say something. Capt Roy has begun objecting even before the court has begun! Please go ahead. Major Puri mentioned Jawan Ramchander twice. So? What should he call him? Major Puri should address him not as Jawan Ramchander but as Sawar Ramchander. What the heck do you mean? Ramchander is a Jawan in the army. Why does it matter if he is addressed as Jawan or Sawar? Sir, it matters and it doesn't. You are a Colonel in the infantry. Would it be right to call you a Colonel of the medical corps? Ramchander is from the Bakhtarband regiment. The sepoys from that regiment are called Sawar, not Jawan. I think the defence counsel is nit picking to stall the court's decision. Sir, since the Indian army's Legal department has deployed you, there is no way there can be any technical faults. But sir, a decision of life and death is not made over technicalities. It is based on the truth. Capt Roy. Please mention only the facts pertinent to this case. Pertaining to Jawan, I mean Sawar Ramchandra. No one may waste the court's time with needless talk and objections. The court martial's presiding officer is Colonel Suraj Singh and you must remember that. I know that. But the judge advocate did say I was right. I regret that you think my objections are a waste of the court's time. Sir, if you think my objections are unnecessary then please appoint another defence counsel. I will leave from here. - Don't threaten me! Everybody knows that Ramchander committed murder. He has admitted to his guilt and it was in the newspapers. Ramchander is on trial, right? How does it matter how he is addressed? Okay, let's carry on. It is clear you've already assigned guilt to Ramchander before trial. Then why have this sham of a court martial? Besides sir, it's not necessary that all that is printed in the newspapers is authentic. Sir, you know it the printed words often tend to lie. Sit down. Major Puri. - Sir. Present your witnesses. - Sir. Thank you, sir. My first witness for this court martial is the regiment's Subedar Balwan Singh. How are you, Subedar? I am fine. Should we begin? - Yes. So tell me. Where were you at 9 pm on the 10th of June? I was near the regiment's guardhouse. Which means you were on duty. No, I wasn't on duty. It was very hot that night and there was a power cut. I was strolling nearby with Havaldar Raj Singh. Will you tell the court who was on duty that day? Sir, Ramchander. - What did you see? There was no power so I could not see anything clearly. But a motorcycle came up. - Hold on. When you say you could not see weren't you wearing your glasses? I don't wear glasses, I have perfect vision. I told you I could not see due to the power cut... - Oh. I get it. But let me tell you for your information that 10th June was a full moon night. The full moon night has enough light to ensure that you can see up to 500 metres away quite clearly. Even a tiny ball tossed in the ground was merely 100 metres away from the site of the crime. As you just mentioned your vision is perfect. Can you tell me the motorcycle which went by the site of the crime had how many riders? - Two. Were they wearing helmets? - No. So the two officers you identified on a moving motorcycle were Jawan... No. Sawar Ramchander must have recognised them. Of course. What happened next? When the motorcycle reached the guard house, Sawar Ramchander shot at it. Point to be noted, sir. He shot at it. The first bullet shot Capt Verma. The motorcycle got off the road and hit a nearby tree. When the motorcycle began to roll down Ramchander shot again. The bullet hit Capt Kapoor in the lower part of the shoulder. The motorcycle toppled over. Sawar Ramchander ran in that direction as soon as it fell. He then cocked his gun again. Raj Singh and I arrived there and grabbed him from the back. When you grabbed Ramchander from the back who was he aiming his rifle at? At the injured Capt Kapoor. At the injured Capt Kapoor. Which implies if you hadn't caught him he would have shot him again and killed him. Yes, certainly. What happened next? The sound of the shot brought many soldiers out of the barracks. About 4 or 5 of them were holding on tight to Ramchander. We took his weapon away so he could not shoot again. But he kept screaming one thing. Let me go! I want to kill Capt Kapoor! I will murder Capt Kapoor. I don't know how he was so insanely strong that night. Sir, it's all crystal clear. Crystal clear. No more questions. Thank you so much. Capt Roy, do you want to cross examine the witness? Major, since when do you know Ramchander? Since the last 3 years. During that time has he ever gotten into a fight? Did he brawl with anyone? Did anyone complain to you about him? No. Nobody complained about him at all. In fact I would say he is a very docile man. If he was given a task by you or any other officer, did he do it well? Ramchander did his duties diligently and properly. Did the late Capt Mohan Verma and Capt B D Kapoor ever complain about him? Did they take any action or punish him? No, not at all. Subedar, he never got into a fight. He never had any issues with anyone. Nobody complained about him to you. Then the question is why did he kill Capt Mohan Verma and why did he attack Capt B D Kapoor to kill? How can I tell you that? I told you what I saw clearly. Subedar. You told us whatever you saw. But the truth is not what we seen. We only see a part of the truth. It's not essential that it is the complete truth. What you see is true. Is it? Tell me, is the spot you are at rotating right now? No. - Is the courtroom moving? Not at all. - Check again. Yes, I did that. You mentioned an eye witness account. - Yes. But Subedar, even you know this. The earth moves constantly. It rotates around its axis and it revolves around the sun. Now since you can't see that it doesn't negate that truth. Capt Bikash Roy. What does rotation have to do with this court martial? You are confusing the issue. Please get to the point. Major Puri is right, Capt Roy. Is your statement relevant to this trial? I have already warned you. Don't waste the court's time on useless things. Sir, you're right. Time is truly precious. Even more so than someone's life. The court's time must not be wasted. It doesn't matter if someone is sentenced to death. I just wish to say the truth isn't so simple or so trivial that we can see it and understand it all. Capt Roy, you may question the witness more if you want. Sir. Subedar, when this incident took place, what was the secret code word of the platoon? What? - Yes. I don't quite understand. - I mean the night of the incident, what was the security password of the platoon? A piece of advice for you, Capt Roy. Please don't speak such pristine Hindi. It needed to be translated into English! Hindi is our mother tongue. If we don't speak regularly in that language we will not add to our knowledge of it. Adding to knowledge! Major Puri. - Sir. So Subedar, tell me. What was the security password of the platoon that night? I don't remember that right now. But if you wish I can ask my regiment clerk and inform you. No Subedar, don't trouble yourself. I know. The password is changed every night. Trying to remember a password that was set months ago is not easy, right? Let me tell you what the password was that night. The password on that full moon night was 'black moon.' Subedar. You identified both the officers on the motorcycle that night. Yes. - Did Ramchander recognise them? Yes, of course. I have mentioned it. Did you inform your men not to ask an officer for a password if they recognise him? Who am I to give orders? The one who doesn't give the password will be stopped. I have been in service for 20 years. It's flawless. Do you think the army needs to give me more time to learn these simple things? No Subedar, don't mind what I say. I know you won't give such an order. Tell me, when both officers reached the guard house on a motorcycle did Ramchander challenge them? 'Who is it?' Did he call out to them? Ramchander didn't call out and ask who it was. I was there and I saw it. Subedar. I am not speaking of seeing, I am talking about hearing. Did you hear that? Ramchander called out, 'Stop! Who goes there?' Ramchander didn't call out and I didn't hear it! How can I say that he called out? Are you implying that that since you didn't hear it, it wasn't said by Ramchander. Were you in Delhi on 15th August? No, why? On 15th August, the PM said in his address from the Red Fort. He would teach India's enemies a good lesson. You weren't there! You didn't hear that. If you didn't hear that it means the PM didn't say that as part of his speech. But I could see everything here, clearly. Subedar, you hear the sound, you don't see it. The fact is that on that night, you were 500 metres from the site of the accident. The motorcycle was running. The sounds of the Bullet motorcycle engine drowned out Ramchander's call asking 'who goes there?' For your information I was only 100 metres away. Major Puri told you and you believed him. Did you measure it with a tape? Did you? I measured the distance with a tape. You were 510 metres away from the crime scene. You could never hear Ramchander call out from that distance. Capt Roy. Very good. You are confusing the Subedar for no reason. He has admitted that he recognised both officers sitting on the bike and Sawar Ramchander identified them too. Then, why call out and ask 'stop, who goes there' constantly? There was a reason, Major Puri. Tell me something. Who are you to stop me from asking questions? Only the presiding officers have that right. Young man, I am not stopping you from asking questions. But stop asking the same question constantly in a roundabout way. Continue, Capt Roy. Subedar, tell me something. When a guard stops someone and asks for the password and calls the person out and if the person doesn't stop then what? Objection. Why ask about something that hasn't been proved in court yet? When was it proved that Sawar Ramchander attacked and called out the two officers? Or that he asked them for the password? How can the witness tell you that? Major Puri. Only you can understand my angst. - Yes. Please note that even Major Puri agrees that how can the witness talk about what he hasn't seen. - Right! He can't tell, sir. - Certainly not. That's why I request this court to go to the scene of the crime tonight. We will go and stand where the Subedar was strolling. Let's have a motorcycle driven over there. Send a guard to the sentry post. He will challenge from there. Then we will know if we can hear the voice from that spot. Very good! Well done! What does that prove? What does it prove? Will it prove that the killer, Ramchander didn't shoot the late Capt Verma? That he didn't wound Capt Kapoor. If that can be proved let's go there. Major Puri, who am I to prove that Ramchander didn't shoot? He confessed to that himself. I just want to remind this court of the laws of the army. Sir, the laws state that if a guard stops someone and asks him the password and even after being challenged when one doesn't stop then the guard can shoot. Capt Roy. You don't need to explain the army laws to the court. Sir. Sir. If Ramchander accepted that he did shoot the bullet then this issue about the challenge is no big deal. Right, sir. We won't conceal any procedures in this court. Your written advice should be mentioned to all. I must say this for your information. If it is proved that the officers didn't stop after Ramchander's challenge then as per army law he has a right to shoot. Sir. Everybody knows of that law. But it is stringently applied in wartime. Don't talk rubbish. Peace or war, the laws remain the same. The law is law, war or no war. This court is here to figure out the truth it won't suppress the truth. The court will move to the site of the crime which will tell us if Ramchander issued the challenge or not. Do you want to speak, Ramchander? - No! Please. Capt Bikash Roy, right now you are questioning the Subedar. Ask him what you want to know. Sir, I didn't issue the challenge to stop. I shot without issuing the challenge, sir! See? - Sir. The court should make note of this confession. Ramchander opened fire without any challenge, sir. Capt Kapoor. - But this is an important point. Are you the prosecutor? - No, sir. But... Sit down. Sorry, sir. You're in a hurry to get Ramchander the death penalty. You will have to give your testimony. You're next in line. Wait for it. Subedar, no more questions for you. I was actually arguing for no good reason. See? Ramchander confessed himself that he shot without issuing the challenge. Your hearing and sight both are perfect. You may go. Do think of one thing before you sleep tonight. Ramchander never had any complaints against him. He never stinted in doing his duty. Why did he suddenly shoot 2 officers of his platoon? Why? Subedar. The truth is not what we see for ourselves. The truth is never overtly evident. It is like a cat huddled in a dark corner. A five minute recess. Listen. - Sir. You have a break too. - Right, sir. Capt Roy. - Sir. One moment. Capt Roy, what do you wish to do? Why did you signal to Ramchander to confess that he shot without issuing the challenge? You have ensured he will hang! Why? I don't want to defend him on a tactical detail. Everybody knows he did shoot and he killed. The question is why did he shoot? I am not here to save him. Nobody can save him. You can try. What I am trying to save is more important than his life. What? Sir, the truth. Okay. As a lawyer or... I am a keeper, sir. What? The hunter of the soul, sir. You can go, sir. The hunter of the soul. What does he mean? Sit down. Major Puri! - Sir. My second witness is Capt B D Kapoor. Sir. Capt Kapoor. Tell me, did you ever take any action against Sawar Ramchander? - No, sir. Did he ever complain about the two of you to a senior officer? No, sir. The most important thing. On the night of the incident, Sawar Ramchander challenged you. No, sir. He opened fire without any challenge. Sir. No further questions. Capt Roy, your witness. I don't wish to question Capt B D Kapoor at present. Allow me to recall him at the right time. Alright. Capt Kapoor. - Sir. Sit down. - Sir. Major Puri. - Sir. Carry on. - Sir. My third and most important witness is the doctor of the regiment Capt Gupta. Sir. Doctor. - Sir. How are you doing? - Good, sir. Very good. Let me begin. - Yes. Where were you on 10th June at 9 pm? Sir, I was returning to the mess on my scooter. I was going to go to the platoon when I heard gunshots. I turned my scooter that way at once, sir. Okay. What happened next? When I got there... - Yes. I saw Capt Verma was lying on the floor. I checked his pulse. - Okay. He was dead. He was shot in the neck. Capt Kapoor was lying unconscious. His right shoulder was bleeding and his pulse was weak. I took off my shirt, tore it to make bandages and tied it on to his shoulder to staunch the blood flow. Okay. Tell me, at that time were was Sawar Ramchander? He was being held by 5 to 6 soldiers. He was trying to get away from them. He kept shouting, let me go. I will kill Capt Kapoor. Point to be noted, sir. What happened, next? The Subedar called the military hospital from the guardhouse. The ambulance arrived in five minutes. We lifted Capt Kapoor and made him lie down in the ambulance, sir. When we made him lie down his bandage came off and he was bleeding again. - Oh! I retied the bandage and stopped the bleeding again. Then we took them to the operation theatre. Sir, the surgeon Colonel Joshi was already there. He told me if I hadn't stopped the bleeding in time, Capt Kapoor would have died. - Okay. So Capt Kapoor was operated on at once. No sir. He was giving blood first. My blood. - What? I mean, my blood group matches his blood group. Then we began surgery. If the bullet had hit an inch lower he would have been hit in the heart. He's lucky Ramchander missed. By the way, sir. Colonel Joshi is recommending me to the Army headquarters for a citation. Rising to the occasion and saving the life of a brother officer. Good job, officer. - Thank you, sir. Sir, I don't have any more questions. Thank you so much. Capt Roy. Capt Kapoor, I am very happy. I am lucky to meet you. What a dedicated man you are! That was a great story. Where did you get medical training? Armed Forces Medical College, Pune. And I am a gold medallist. Amazing! Your list of talents doesn't seem to end! Dr Gupta, you mentioned that that night you heard Ramchander shouting to be let go and he would kill Capt Kapoor. Yes, I heard it myself. Tell me, why do you think he was shouting that way? Did he go insane that night? Capt Roy, a crazy man and a man crazed by anger are distinct. He was raring to kill. You don't try to trap me. You are very clever. So clever! You should be the lawyer instead of me. But I have to be the advocate for today, sir. So tell me, about 5 months ago Ramchander was admitted to the army hospital. Why? He had typhoid. I admitted him. Typhoid? How did you know that? Did he come to you with health issues? No. Our regiment and the air force regiment had a hockey match. 10 minutes after the match began he fainted on the ground. How high was the fever? About 104 degrees. I summoned an ambulance and reported it as typhoid. Later when he was checked at the hospital they found out my diagnosis was right. How could it be wrong? You are a gold medallist from AFMC Pune, after all. I don't understand one thing. The match started at 4pm in the evening. Ramchander fainted within 10 minutes. Can the fever rise to 104 degrees within 10 minutes? - No. Typhoid doesn't have a sudden fever increase like malaria. He must have had a fever before the match. So... Didn't you know before the match he had a fever? Capt Roy, how could I know? We don't check the players for a fever before the match. What's so funny? Dr Gupta, I am very sorry. It was a lousy thing to say. - Yes, yes, yes. Actually, I don't have medical know how. - That's fine. So you say that without a thermometer you can't find out how much fever someone has. See, you can figure it out by checking the pulse. To know the exact temperature you need a thermometer. You need to use a thermometer. - Yes. Thank you for the information, Dr Gupta. Thanks for adding to my knowledge. - Yes. Where are you going? Please, sir. Come this way. - I thought I'd finished. Finished? We've not even started yet. Come back. Okay. Come on. Should we begin? - Yes. So tell me. On the day of the match At what time did Ramchander come to you for the sick report? The sick report is normally given at 9 pm. I didn't ask for that time. I asked you when did Havaldar Raj Singh and 2 other soldiers bring Ramchander to you for the sick report? Havaldar Raj Singh was also wearing a watch. Tell me, at what time was Ramchander brought in? I don't quite remember the exact time. Okay. Let's call Havaldar Raj Singh. He may remember. Tell me did they bring him before or after the match? Answer him. Doctor. It's okay, Dr Gupta. I can understand. He came to you for a sick report. Why would you check the time? You are a doctor, you would check the patient. Tell me about that, then. When Ramchander was brought to you who was sitting next to you? You must remember that. Capt Kapoor was sitting with me. Oh, he was with you. Is he your friend? That's your personal business. Tell me, when Capt Kapoor was sitting with you and the sick Ramchander was in front of you what was your diagnosis? Did you use the thermometer? Did you? Dr Gupta. You can't avoid answering. You may be slapped with a lawsuit under the Army Act 45. Unbecoming conduct of an officer. I hope you know this, Captain. Sir, these crabs always make excuses about being sick. That's why I didn't use the thermometer. What are you implying by 'crab'? Sir, that is what we call soldiers who are... Doctor, why are you calling me Sir? We both are captains. I guess you know that the word you've used is an abuse. The British called Indian soldiers that when we were slaves. Crab is an abuse. Who am I to stop you? You are God! Dr Gupta, you really are God! Without checking the pulse or the temperature you found out that Ramchander the crab was lying. He is pretending to be sick. Right, God? - Yes. No! I didn't check his pulse. I didn't use the thermometer. Capt Kapoor told me that he is fine and pretending to be sick. Capt Kapoor told you that? Explain, who is the doctor Capt Kapoor or... I remember. Havaldar Raj Singh told me that Capt Kapoor talked to you in English and stopped you from using the thermometer. He cussed too. What did Capt Kapoor say? Sir... - What did he say? Tell me. Sir, he said that 'this *** is shamming.' 'There is nothing wrong with him.' Which means, this rascal Ramchander is lying. Nothing has happened, he is pretending to be sick. Right? Capt Kapoor said so and you believed him. Until Ramchander fainted away at the match you didn't even put a thermometer into his mouth. Obviously these facts were suppressed. Dr Gupta you are a man of many talents. Mr Gold Medallist from AFMC, Pune. Now you are finished. Dr Gupta, sit in your seat. Okay. Sir, there are no more questions. Captain Gupta. Gold medallist! Start looking for a new job. Forget about your citation. Get back to your seat. - Sir. Sir, will you have tea here or in the adjoining room? In the adjoining room. We take a 10 minute recess. Vikas. Yes, Capt Kapoor. What are you doing this evening? Come on home. Why? What is the matter? My name isn't Bikash, it's Bikash. Oh! Bikash Roy, sorry. Why should I visit your house? It's nothing, let's sit and have drinks together. I don't drink. So what? We will do something else. What do you mean? I mean... - Get a woman? If you say so? Yes, your wife doesn't live with you, these days. She left you, right? When did she leave you? Listen to yourself! Both of us are officers. Be nice! I believe every criminal is my enemy. Criminal? I got shot, but I am the criminal? What do you think? Can you harm me? Ramchander is the killer not me. What kind of officer are you? Look at yourself. You don't have the etiquettes of speaking to another officer. Capt Kapoor, forget that dastardly sense of officers' fraternity. You also know who the killer is. Why do you seem so scared? - Me? You ask yourself some questions, not others. Don't threaten me, Captain. Don't you dare threaten me. I have encountered many men like you. Really? - Too many! Do you know Bangla? - I am not Bengali. Okay, let me tell you in Hindi. There is a proverb in Bengali. When the tiger strikes it causes at least 7 wounds. Can't you salute an officer when he goes past you? Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Tell me... Did Sawar Ramchander complain to you about these 2 officers? No. - Did these two officers ever complain against Ramchander? Never. Sir, tell us about the service record of these 2 officers so far. It's very good. Excellent. In fact, they have been brilliant. I have nothing else to ask, sir. Colonel Rawat, you said that Ramchander didn't have an enmity with these 2 officers. - Yes. Then, why did Ramchander shoot them both? Did Ramchander go insane that night? - Captain Roy. You can't ask him that question at this point. If Ramchander wants to plead insanity... When did I speak of it, Major Puri? When did I speak about temporary madness? Sir, you may seek an insanity plea but I won't. I will seek it? I will seek an insanity plea? Have you lost your mind? Mind your language. You know Ramchander got a medical test before the court martial. Don't interrupt Capt Roy. Continue, Captain. Go on. So, Col Rawat, tell me. Why did Ramchander shoot these 2 officers? I don't know. Why didn't he shoot any other officers and kill him? I don't know. You don't know anything, sir. You live in a very innocent world. What are you saying, Captain? Are you trying to blame me? No sir, how can I blame you? You don't know anything at all! I saw one of Ramchander's confidential reports. You have personally written an A plus score for him here. Why, sir? - Yes. Ramchander is one of the most active soldiers of our regiment. An excellent soldier. Sir, I will repeat the question. Did Capt Kapoor ever complain against Ramchander? No. I haven't received any complaints against Ramchander from anyone. When you reached the parade ground on 7th March what was going on? There was a parade in progress, what else? Sir. I guess, I asked the wrong question. Did you forget? Capt Kapoor punished Ramchander and made him salute him 100 times. Right. Actually, I was going to the golf ground that day. I saw all the soldiers standing at attention in the parade ground. Ramchander was saluting Capt Kapoor over and over. The Subedar said that Capt Kapoor has punished him by saluting 100 times. Simple. Sir, when you saw that did you make any enquiries? What enquiries? I trust my officers. If Capt Kapoor noticed that Ramchander didn't salute properly he has every right to punish him. You are right, sir. But sir, you gave Capt Kapoor the order that he must respond to every salute by Ramchander 100 times. I don't know if you know this rule. But when an officer is in uniform he must respond to a salute. Don't you know that? The fact is legal department officers like us don't know much about such glorious army practices. Sir, I have read this report and it says here that you increased his rations. He was given 2 litres of milk and extra almonds. Why, sir? Actually, it was our regiment's racing day. He came first in the 5,000 metre race. That was only 20 seconds more than the Army record. I was stunned to see his timings. I believed that if he was given extra milk and almonds he would break the Army record, too. I salute officers like you, sir. Such a discerning gaze is rare. Sir, did Ramchander fulfil your expectations? Of course. At the North Command games Ramchander won the 5,000 metre race once again. But this time he was only 5 seconds above the Army record. Could he break the Army record? What about that? He could have even broken the Asian record. But this incident occurred before the Inter Command games. Otherwise he could have won an Asian medal for us. Yes, sir. Ramchander could have won the Asian medal for us. Before Ramchander who was the champion of the 5,000 metre race in the regiment? Capt Kapoor was the champion before Ramchander. Oh. So why did Capt Kapoor lose this race? How the heck do I know? Sometimes you ask very stupid questions, Captain. Sir, you have no reason to get angry. The answer is very simple. Capt Kapoor lost the race because Ramchander ran faster than him. That is so informative! Great. Wonderful. Tell me something, Capt Roy. What does the winner of the race have to do with this court martial? There is a connection, Major Puri. You know this and everyone in this court also knows it. But nobody wants to admit it. Tell me something, sir. Why do you object to every question I ask? Why does that bother you so much? Are you sure it's not because you are beginning to feel the truth? Perhaps. Captain Roy. You speak a lot about the soul and the paranormal. Which Gods do you pray to? Tell me. Kali, sir. The one who drinks the blood of sinners. Mahakali. The one with a thousand arms, Mahakali. Col Rawat. Tell me, where is Capt Kapoor's wife these days? She is Capt Kapoor's wife, not mine. Ask him! One moment. Excuse me. Sir, I can't figure out what is going on here. What is the meaning of asking personal questions? It would defame his wife. How will that happen? Do we have reporters here? Our whole proceeding is in camera. Besides, in the Army personal lives are limited. If you have foreign guests at home then you have to inform the CO about it. Right, sir? If you drink too much you have to report to the CO. All over the world, there is no such thing as total personal life. Continue, Captain. Sir, Capt Kapoor's wife is not with him these days. Can you tell me why? Captain. Capt Roy, why are you asking the Colonel that? There is a reason for it, sir. The CO of any platoon is a father figure to the soldiers. The entire platoon is his family. The problems of individual members are never personal, sir. Mrs Kapoor came to meet you in your office. 1 month before this incident. Can you tell us what issues she had with Capt Kapoor? But how do you know this? Mrs Kapoor is in Delhi with her parents these days. I went to meet her. She gave me a copy of the letter she wrote to you. What did the letter say, sir? Capt Roy! You have no right to defame a man's wife. Who is on court martial here? Is it Capt Kapoor's wife or this killer Ramchandra? Tell me. - He is right, Capt Roy. If your questions are relevant to this trial then you can continue to ask questions. Please. - Okay, sir. I will not ask Col Rawat anything. I will tell you what issues Mrs Kapoor had. That night, Capt Kapoor went back home from the mess, totally sloshed. He was dead drunk. He went to his wife and she got out of bed when she saw him and said. 'Don't come near me.' 'Don't come close to me, you are stinking of alcohol.' 'Do not touch me.' But Capt Kapoor was flying high. He tore his wife's nightgown and said. 'I have the license to sleep with you.' 'Don't you know how we are related?' 'I am your husband.' Mrs Kapoor threatened him and said. 'If you touch me' 'I will complain to the CO, just you wait and see.' But Capt Kapoor wasn't going to listen to her. He slapped her hard and said. 'Will you go to the CO?' 'Is he your lover?' 'Is he your dad?' 'Will you complain to the CO?' After that he hurled an ashtray on the table at her head. Mrs Kapoor was hit right under her ear. Capt Kapoor never realised since he was so drunk when she passed out and how badly she was hurt. Capt Roy. You've crossed all limits. Were you in the room that night? How do you know all this? I wasn't there, that night. Someone else was there. Who was it? The eye witness to this incident. Sawar Ramchander. In those days he was Capt Kapoor's ADC. Mrs Kapoor was taken to the hospital by Ramchander. Sir, I can lie, Ramchander can lie. But this letter... One moment. This letter can't lie, sir. This is the copy of the letter that she wrote to you, sir. It clearly states that 'my husband is a beast.' 'He is an animal, he is a sadist!' Mrs Kapoor filed for divorce. The divorce papers are in this file. But I was told his wife slipped and fell. That's why she hurt her head. Are you shocked, sir? The wives always slip and fall. The husbands never do anything. The daughters-in-law are flawed not the daughters. Sir, you know that day Mrs Kapoor insisted that the civil police handle this case at the army hospital. But the officers of the regiment clung to their fraternity. They convinced the CO and suppressed the case. Sir, just imagine. If the civil police had gotten wind of this case the Indian Army would have been disgraced. I would say she is a warrior. She is one of those who never cow down to atrocities and torture. A person may shatter or shake her will or self confidence. Sir, they won't atone. They won't bow down. Those who don't bend will often be broken. Sir, whatever I mentioned is in this file. Sir, this file contains the testimony which Mrs Kapoor hand wrote and gave in the court. She mentions that her life is in danger. She is in danger from her husband Capt B D Kapoor. - Capt Roy! You are a Naxalite. Capt Kapoor! - Your brother was one too! He was killed in a police encounter. You are also predisposed to that kind of rebellion. Sir, this man is trying to defame the entire army. You belong to a family of Naxals. Let me speak, sir. He has created a racket... - Sir! Don't touch me! Relax. Capt Kapoor. Go back to your seat. Go back! This court will not allow any of this. Remember that. I will not tolerate this. This court will resume tomorrow at 10 am. Capt Kapoor was right, sir. My brother was a Naxalite who was killed in a police encounter. He used to have high ideals and dream of a utopian world. Those who have high ideals and utopian dreams often get killed by others. Capt Kapoor. The people of our clan are used to fighting for justice. I guess you don't know that if my brother was a Naxalite my father is a judge in the Kolkata High Court. By the way yesterday you didn't reveal a national level secret. Before we join the army the police conducts a full investigation. They enquire about your character and your family. The police knows all about me and so does the Indian government. But despite that they gave me the chance to be in uniform and sent me to oppose a fine officer like you in this lawsuit. I guess that is hassling you. Right? Sir, I request that Capt Kapoor's statement should be struck off the record. He spoke in an excess of emotion and anger. He is dazed. After all, he is a human being. Major Puri. Is he a human being? Are you implying that Capt Kapoor can say what he pleases in anger and do anything he wants? If a man loses his mind it will not obstruct the fight for justice. Capt Roy. You are fighting for justice in the wrong corner, this time. You're defending a murderer. Major Puri. The court will give a verdict about that. Neither of us will decide that. The court needs to consider why did a simple, disciplined soldier shoot 2 officers of his own platoon? Could it be that he was scared Capt Mohan Verma and Capt Kapoor would try to kill him? His wife did mention it in court. Her life was in danger. From her husband. Just imagine, sir. I wonder how he treated Ramchander to coerce him to take up his gun. When there is danger to life even a cow will attack. He is human. Capt Roy, you are very smart. Yes. You are very smart. What do you wish to prove? Tell me. Are you trying to prove from that ash stray incident that Sawar Ramchander was so scared that day he was so terror stricken that he fired the shots? My dear friend, let me inform you on 10th June at 9 pm the two officers were on a motorbike and they were unarmed. Sawar Ramchandra shot them without calling out a challenge. They didn't have any weapons! Don't you try to prove that this was an act of self defence. This court will listen to witnesses and evidence. It won't respond to made up stories. Sir, I get the feeling that Capt Roy is here to make a speech at a psychology seminar. You are right, Major Puri. We are here to argue over a trivial truth and here I am talking about these grand ideals. You are right, sir. Sir, I request the court to call Subedar Balwan Singh again. Subedar. Don't imagine that I called you here to hassle you. The Subedar is a link from the soldiers to the CO. The grudges and complaints of the soldiers are conveyed via him to the CO and the CO connects to them via the Subedar. That's why the post of Subedar is significant and respected. Am I right? - Yes. Subedar, please tell me. The CO increased Ramchander's rations. He put him on special rations. Was Ramchander Capt Kapoor's ADC at that time? No. On Regiment Day when Ramchander won the race after that the CO increased his rations. After that I assigned Ramchander as Capt Kapoor's ADC. Col Rawat increased Ramchander's rations so he could prepare for the Northern Command games. And you assigned him to duties as Capt Kapoor's ADC! Why? Capt Kapoor requested me to do the same. Didn't you tell him he was in training for the races? Capt Kapoor told me he'd practice with him morning and evening. We all know that Capt Kapoor was the champion of the 5,000 metre race. It seemed okay by me... - Of course it did. They both were runners. Ramchander must have trained with gusto, then. He must have been running like anything. Did he come for training daily? - Yes. How many times a month did he come? Two or three times. What did you say? Subedar. Speak louder. Everybody must hear you. He used to train two or three times a month, sir. The CO increased his rations so he could train. While he stopped coming for training! That was wrong, Subedar. Yes. What did you do? Did you make enquiries? I asked him. He said when it's time for practice Capt Kapoor put him to work at the house. Oh! Subedar, tell me. What does the ADC do? Why does an officer have an ADC? The rules state that he cleans his officer's uniform. He keeps the uniform spick and span. He cleans the officer's weapons. But you know... - I know it, Subedar. The rules and laws are meant for the weak. An ADC for an officer is like a servant. A personal servant. Go to the market, fetch groceries. Put this, serve the food. Iron the lady wife's clothes. Keep the officer pleased. Right? This is not your fault. You can only take action on a subordinate, right? You can't complain about someone higher in the order. But before the Northern command games took place I took him off that duty. Believe me, he won the race after just 10 days of practice. Very good! Did you take Ramchander away from that duty or were you told to? Tell me. Answer him. Subedar. Answer him. Did the CO issue the order to relieve Ramchander of his duty? Answer him. No, sir. Then what? Ramchander complained to me. What did he say to you? Tell us, Subedar. Why are you so ashamed? What did Ramchander complain about? Sir, you know Ramchander belongs to a lower caste. Capt Kapoor used to call him Harijan. Ramchander asked to be relieved of that duty. Or he would go and complain to the CO directly. Subedar. Ramchander made a false complaint to you and you believed him! Tell me something. How can anyone object to the word Harijan? The word was coined by the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi. If Capt Kapoor called Ramchander Harijan what is wrong with that? Subedar, you must never listen to wrong complaints against officers by the foot soldiers. That's not the point, sir. - Then what is it? Capt Kapoor used to call Ramchander a rat and cobbler. His friend Capt Verma used to call him a darn rat. What did Ramchander do then? Ramchander refused to work for Capt Kapoor. How dare a soldier and have the courage to refuse to work for his officer? Subedar, you and Col Rawat told me that Ramchander is a stickler for duty. What did you do? You have made a wrong move. No, sir. Sir, it went too far one day. How come? Capt Kapoor had some guests over. A child pooped in the drawing room. Capt Kapoor told Ramchander to clean out the poop. Ramchander refused to do so. Subedar. What are you saying poop for? Use the country or rural dialect word for it. ***. Say that louder. ***. Subedar, I can't hear it. Speak louder. ***. Ramchander refused to clean up Capt Kapoor's kid's ***! That's why Capt Kapoor said you are a night soil worker and a cobbler, a *** wiper! How dare you refuse to clean up the ***? Your ancestors have been carrying baskets of our *** on their heads. Did Ramchander say that to you? Yes. He could be lying. Ramchander doesn't lie, sir. I have heard Capt Kapoor abusing in that manner, quite often. What did you do about it? Did you report to the CO? Sir, I figured let me not spread such a vile story. It would be better to resolve it in private. Very good idea, Subedar. Well thought out move. Never allow talk of justice to spread. The powerful have been doing that for ages now. They have been putting down injustice. Very well done! But you forgot that a tiny injustice leads to a bigger one. If you'd reported this to your CO Col Rawat an officer would not be dead. This court martial would not take place. I should have told the CO all about it. I made a huge error. No Subedar, you didn't make any mistakes. This is our system. This is how we live. Suppress the complaints of the lowly and weak. Ignore the mistakes of the powerful and mighty. That is our system for you. You didn't make any errors, Subedar. You can leave. I have no further questions. Sir. I would call on Capt Kapoor for his testimony. Sir. Capt Kapoor, why did you receive these medals? Well, I got these medals for... - In Hindi, please... Sir, I am not proficient in Hindi. I may be allowed to speak in English. Capt Kapoor, where were you born? In Punjab, Amritsar. Where were you educated? - In Punjab, Amritsar. I did my BA from there. I saw that. I saw your certificates for the Matric and BA degrees. Well, I saw the certificates. It's surprising. You chose Hindi at both levels and cleared the exams. And yet you don't know Hindi. I was born in Bengal. I was educated in Bengal and yet I can speak Hindi. What language do you speak to the soldiers in? I can speak a smattering of pidgin Hindi. Pidgin? What does that mean? Do you feel insulted about speaking in Hindi? Insulted? Officers always speak in English. This has been prevalent since the time of the British, you know. Capt Kapoor. The British era has passed years ago. Capt Roy. - Sir. We aren't arguing language here. Let him speak in English if he wishes to. Okay, sir. Capt Kapoor, tell me. Why did Ramchander complain to Subedar Balwan Singh? These days, people from good families don't enter the army. The lower castes are recruited and this is the consequence. Constant complaints. Shaming, blaming. You mean, shamming. Yeah, whatever it is. What do you mean by good families? I mean people from good families which are well to do. Recruit the naked and the damned in the army and give them 2 square meals and they will lose it. Of course! Why won't that happen? Capt Kapoor, you come from very good stock. The family is well to do, right? - Of course. Our ancestors have ruled since the last four generations. IAS, IPS, IFS. Army, Navy, Air Force. You name it and you see them there. Truly your family tree is fabulous. - Yes. I am proud of it. Where is your dad, at present? At home. What did he do? He retired as a DIG. Couldn't he make it to IG? Just asking. Are you saying being DIG isn't good enough? It is not! But during the last five years of service, he was suspended twice. So what? Nothing was proved. He came out with flying colours. But as far as I know... - Capt Roy. Please, please. You can't defame someone's parents. None of this is relevant. Who is the court martial for? His parents? Or Capt Kapoor? Or is Sawar Ramchander in the dock? I am really sorry, Major Puri. I won't ask any such questions. I just want to know what good family implies. If you have cleared that up, let's move on. A lot has been cleared up, sir. Capt Kapoor, please tell me. Why did you lose in the 5,000 metre race to Ramchander? Ramchander used to herd cattle in the village. I bet he used to chase animals all day long. Defeating me in the race didn't make him Superman, did it? No, you are Superman. Since every night, you fly high in the mess. Since you drink till late at night in the mess you have been warned off by Col Rawat. I guess, that's why you lost the race. Once you lost the race to Ramchander you began to insult him every single day. Ramchander became the enemy, right? Captain, enemies are equals not inferior folks. Who is inferior? - Lowly folks. By that you mean people like Ramchander. Capt Kapoor you called Ramchander a night soil worker, a cobbler and cleaner. He lied. Is it a crime to call a cleaner a cleaner? It's not a crime. It's not a crime, Bhikaridas Kapoor. Please refer to my name properly. It's B D Kapoor. I saw your Matric certificate. Your full name is stated as Bhikaridas Kapoor. Do you know why your mother named you thus? Because you were born after they pleaded to many sages. Your elite class family believes in the superstition that when a son is born after a lot of difficulty he is given a vile and lousy name like for example Bhikaridas Kapoor. Don't you dare call me by any other name! It's B D Kapoor! If you can call a cleaner a cleaner then why can't I call you by your own birth name? Bhikaridas Kapoor? Stop it. Stop it otherwise... What can you do? Slap me? You slapped Ramchander. When he refused to be abused. The way you slapped your wife when she is called you impotent and so much more... - You ***! You ***! I will kill you. - Back off! Captain! - Sir. Don't you dare touch me. Shamsher. Relax. Capt Kapoor. Go back to your seat. All my questions are answered, sir. I don't have any other questions for Capt Kapoor. Major Puri. - Sir. Do you have any questions? - No, sir. The defence counsel may present his witness, if he wishes. Capt Roy, do you want to produce any witness? I don't wish to answer any of your questions. I committed murder and should be punished for it. You will be punished for sure. What is your name? I told you, I won't answer you. I didn't ask you a question. I asked for your name. Your name is Ramchander. After Lord Ramchander. Lord Ramchander won the good fight for justice. I guess, that is why your parents named you thus. Right? I don't know why my parents named me Ramchander. But Capt Mohan Verma and Capt Kapoor always said these days every cleaner and cobbler is called Ramchander. I don't wish to answer you. I have confessed to killing Capt Mohan Verma. Do you want a Paramvir Chakra for doing that? Do you want to get garlanded for that? You will be hanged. You will hang for killing someone. How proud you are of killing someone. Do you think you are God? You didn't scared to kill, but you don't dare to speak here. The laws and the Constitution gives the lower castes concessions but you all wish to stay as you are! Repressed, cowardly and scared. After swearing to tell the truth you are refusing to say a word! Capt Mohan Verma and Capt Kapoor were right. Ramchander the rat! Ramchander the cleaner! The night soil worker! - Don't you abuse me, sir! I told you, I won't answer you. Ramchander. You are an important soldier in the army. The regiment is proud of you. We are not your enemies. Tell us what happened to you truthfully. You lived bravely. Face the truth bravely. Ramchander. You didn't stop the two officers at the guardhouse that night. You didn't challenge them. But despite that, they stopped their motorbike there. Why? When I was on guard duty they would stop their bike there. They would abuse me. I got my duty changed, after telling the Subedar. What did they call you that night? What did they call you that night, Ramchander? Tell me, what did they call you? Night soil worker! Cobbler! You ***! My mother must have slept with a higher caste man! I bet she slept with an upper caste man. Sir, I have no further questions for Ramchander. Major Puri. Do you have any more questions? - No, sir. Ramchander. Sit down. Major Puri. - Sir. Your closing statement. Sir, Sawar Ramchander has confessed to it all. I have nothing else to prove. Capt Roy certainly tried to prove that Sawar Ramchander was treated cruelly. Let's admit he was mistreated but in a society which prides and founds itself on the law and justice. There are other ways of rebellion. But no! Sawar Ramchander had to resort to one way. To murder. Sawar Ramchander could have complained to the CO to the Army Chief and the highest ranking officer of the Army, the President. But he chose not to do so. Let's admit that these two officers hassled him. They abused him. But that is an ethical issue. You don't counter abuse with a bullet. Never. Every soldier in the army is trained with discipline and taught diligence to duty, endurance and courage, too. If every soldier begins to react in this manner then he is no better than a hooligan on the streets. Sawar Ramchandra has committed murder. He fired a gun. That's why under the Indian Army Act 69 and under the Indian Penal Code, Section 302 Sawar Ramchander should be punished stringently. So that in future no soldier can dare to do so. It would be a lesson to every soldier of the country. I don't have anything further to add, sir. Thank you so much. Capt Bikash Roy. Major Puri is absolutely right, legal council. We live in the kind of society which is founded by the law and system. There is no room for a personal dissent in this society. Our society, the law and the system has accepted ways to express dissent. But do those paths lead anywhere at all, sir? Do they go anywhere at all? They don't lead anywhere, sir. Opposition is not an act. It won't wait for the last act to take place. Powerful peoples' dissent is called political and that takes them into the corridors of power at once. And the dissent of the weak will be branded rebellion. It leads them to the noose in one move. The smaller forms of dissent are constantly suppressed. They are ignored and not seen, constantly. There is an explosion every time. A deadly explosion. The society which is run on the basis of casteist issues and discriminate against people based on high and low it will always be a short lived society. The country has been free since 72 years. But we are still slaves, sir. Enslaved by human predispositions and mentalities. We are still enslaved by these feudal tendencies. Forget about equality, sir. We don't want to offer the right of equality to inferior folks. Major Puri is absolutely right, sir. Ramchander has committed a crime. He must be punished. He should hang for this. Despite vowing to protect the country he has refused to clean his officer's kid's ***. That's a crime. Despite vowing to protect the country he refused to listen to his officer's abuses and that is a crime. As per the Indian Army Act 69 and the Indian Penal Code, Section 302, Ramchander should be hung to death. He should be sentenced to death, over and over! What do you say? I will give the decisive vote. Life and death will be decreed by my casting vote. You ***! What are you looking at me? - Kapoor! Why are you looking at me? - Kapoor! Stop him! Gentlemen! Kapoor! - Stop it! Don't look at me! Get him out of here! Come on! Sir. He did not survive. Come on! Sir. The gun went off when Capt Kapoor tried to snatch it. Ramchander. I have nothing for you apart from a death sentence. I will accept whatever you give me, sir. Capt Bikash Roy. Can you tell me what just happened what was that? Let me tell you. Poetic justice.
