With your husband's permission. May I, madam? Please. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's just a moment, sir. Just a moment. That's it. Stay still, stay still. Music makes my customers' smiles more beautiful. Stay still. Birdie, birdie. Stay still, stay still! Birdie, birdie. Thank you, thank you. Now we'll see who's won the prize. My husband never hits the mark. Mine is even worse! - When will it be born? - I don't know. Pretty soon, madam, pretty soon. Here we go! Well, ladies. What do you think? Very well! The gentleman has won, the latest fad in toys in Paris. Oh, a nice toy! I'll know how to make it work. - I hope you'll have a lot of fun with it. - Yes. The first toy for your child. So, shall we keep on walking? - Yes, let's go, let's go. - But don't go so fast, hey! It's been a long time since I ate peanuts. Give me a quarter of a kilo of peanuts. Your change, sir. Two cents and I clear off here. What's wrong with you, good man? Nobody sells a thing here! Everybody goes to the Frenchmen's stall... ...and I'm going to move my business there. Let's go. Lucky bird! - Here. - For you or for the lady? Let's see what luck the lucky bird keeps for my wife. Birdie, draw a paper. Come on, just one! Give the fortune to this good lady. Now turn it around and around. Like that, now go home. Thanks. Let's see what does it say. Your fate, is that of the good and kind souls... ...you're very beloved and you yourself love very much the man living together by you. You'll be very happy with him and from your love, a son shall be born. A son! Your attention, "madamas" and "mesiews"! In this stall you'll admire something marvelous! The Cin?matographe! The moving pictures! The marvelous invention of Brothers Lumiere! Come in and enter the wonder of cinema. Let's go and see that moving pictures thing. I don't know if I should in my condition. Don't doub it, madam, go in and you'll get convinced. - You'll be able to rest here. - Yes. Come in, gentlemen, come in, the show is about to start! Don't miss it, it's wonderful! Come in, gentlemen, come in! - Here there's room! - I want to go in. Thanks. - You really stomped on me! - Sorry, madam, I didn't mean to. And now we're gonna start the show. Don't be afraid, nothing is gonna happen to you. The white sheet right in front of you will be lit up. And you'll be able to admire the marvelous invention of these French wisemen... ...Brothers Lumiere! What your amazed eyes are witnessing now, this moving picture, is the Cin?matographe! And what you're seeing, is the famous dance of Clodoches. The great Parisian world famous attraction. Mainly in the "Molin Rouge" The palace of attractions of France. The quartet, made up of two beautiful young ladies and two elegant gentlemen, perform for you this modern dance. With her rhythmic movements, full of youth, joy, life, and so on. This dancing lady, the showgirl Fif?, at this very moment, performing before La Belle Otero, show us, along her art, her rich wardrobe, lush with blond laces, lace edgings and Chantilly laces with a fine display of fantasy and good taste. Now it's a fast train, heading at full speed towards you. But don't be afraid, for nothing can happen to you. This wonder of science, the cin?matographe, is completely harmless. You see? The train passed by and no one was hurt. And now, "madams" and "mesiews"! The magic patriot woman! A conjuring trick scene by the gorgeous young lady "Mim?". As you can see... This scene has feet and head. It's taking shape, the body. But, whose body? The body of a policeman! And quite a raising hell, gentlemen! This is getting complicated! Now we have a Breton farmworker! He turns into an Indian! But Mim? is very smart and so... ...we have now a Chinese. And now a grenadier, presenting arms. To whom? To the Emperor! Vive la France! And now, gentlemen! A burglar in the bedroom! One of these frivoulous comedies so fashionable in Paris. The burglar, taking advantage of the fact that sisters Dupont are away... ...entered the bedroom. But the arrival of the sisters forces the burglar to hide behind the folding screen. You can ask whatever you want. Tell me, tell me... Excuse me, sir, how does that gadget works? Oh, it's a secret, the moving pictures! You wanna have a seat? Pure magic, sir, pure magic! Any more questions? And now, the Spanish magician, Pedrito... ...Melies' outstanding disciple. My God, it's crying! Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights! Oh, my, it's a baby! A baby being born in my theatre! Cin?matographe Lumiere congratulates you, sir. THE BROKEN COIN Look how he hits! I don't like that brute, I prefer The Tramp. Come on, The Tramp is a clown! And "Polo" is a fraud, his punches are a fake! Well, here's one for you, learned from him! For Pete's sake, don't cause no damage! Come on, behave youselves! Come on, stop it! Get out, get out! Operator, Operator, with the police please. My theatre! Operator! Take him to the station! I didn't started it, it was the kid! Sit down! Look! This is gonna be a good movie, indeed! - We have to come and see it. - We can't miss it. And that one, great fightings! We have to come too! - If my mom allows me to! - Of course she will. Give me five cents of peanuts. Me too five cents! - Boy, I laughed my head off. - It's good, The Tramp. Well, Polo ain't that bad too. Carlos! Ana! Carlos!, Carlos! Who did that to you? Nobody, it's nothing. I just had a fight with Luis. Well, yes, now I fancy Polo. Did you notice the jump he made, from the roof to the horse? He's a great guy! Now you fancy Polo? Yes, of course! And Pearl White? What do you mean with that? Let's go and trade cards with those, shall we? Let's go! You wanna trade cards? What kind are yours? I got cards of the Kaiser, the Tiger and Marsahl Fox and football. I don't like those. You got any of films? Of course we got! But they're worth more. How many in exchange for The Tramp's head? Two cards of Pearl White. - I want four. - OK! I'll give you four, I have plenty. - Oh, yeah. Well, now I want six! - You're a cheat, you said four! I'll give you five. All right. Maybe you gave him too many. No, I didn't give him too many. Hi, mom. Who has beaten you, my son? - Nobody, it's nothing. - Nothing? The thing is you're scruffy and a rascal. You should be ashamed of yourself! You will never go again to the movies on your own. My goodness, what a scratch, you almost got killed! You should see the other kid. Yes, that's it. Really nice! Fighting in the street like a pair of rascals. Of course, this can't go on like this. And besides, just wait and you'll see when you father comes! I'm not helping you today in anyhting. You asked for it. Well, you on your own will suffer the consequences. My God, my God! - Beatriz, Beatriz! - What's up, what's wrong with you? The war is over! How marvellous! And what's wrong with you? Quarrelling again? - What was the reason why? - Nothing, the usual. Fighting. Well, never mind. Today it's a day to forgive anything. - Look, Beatriz, look what's in the newspaper! - What is it, what? The Europe war is over. In a train car and in the woods of Compi?gne. The General Staffs on behalf of the warring countries... ...have signed an armistice treaty. What do you think? Big enthusiasm in Paris. So the news was known, the public buildings and embassies, raised their flags. The bells of the capital's churches were set ringing. Improvised cort?ges appeared unexpectedly, preceded by flags, and singing the national anthems of the allied peoples. We, from this bastion, Spain, hope having enlightened our monarch and his rulers... Give me. I'll carry your backpack for a while. Hey, Luis, let's make some pictures! All right. OK, stand over there! No, move over to the right! Hold on, don't move, I'm making it from below. Move over to your right. If I don't fail my year-end exams, dad promised to give me a "Pathe Baby" as a present. Lucky you! We'll make a movie, right? Well, of course! But now stand still for a moment. Still, still. Now! INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION BARCELONA 1929 THE FILMS SUBMITED TO THE COMPETITION ABOUT THE EXPOSITION ARE VERY SUCCESFUL REVEALING YOUNG RISING STARS. - Excuse me, miss. - Yes, sir? Come in, please. Take note to make an employment contract offer as an operator, in favour of Don Carlos... Don Carlos Dur?n. Winner of the last filmmaking contest. You can find out his addres in this newspaper's office. When it's ready, write it down in the card. Yes, sir. Come in! A gentleman to see you. Hi, Carlos! Hey, Luis, where did you spring from! Well, in Barcelona again on a few day's leave. Man, I'm glad. So, how's life? You bad travelling actor. Tell me about it! Nothing new, as you can imagine. Every day with more vocation. - But... with hope? - Man! That goes with you until the end. As soos as I'm discharged, I'm going to Madrid to become a profesional actor. I have some very interesting proposals. I'm so glad, you sham Eddie Polo. You still remember, eh? Well. And what about you? Well, I... Here, read! But no. Before we'll have some drinks. Have a seat! Hey, it's a good oportunity. Congratulations, man. To your success! To yours! Hey, Calder?n! I have also cinema stuff. Look! Biographies of childhood old acquaintances. Goood gracious, Pearl White! By the way, what has become of Ana? She's in Melilla, his father was posted there. I've known anything about here in quite a long time. Me neither. And you'll listen to Al Jolson, in a selection from 'The Singing Fool'. The first talking movie picture, quite a big hit in our city. What do you think about "talkies" movies? Absolutely unnecesary. Cinema has its own means of expression, which make useless using words. Well, but you can't deny me that words adapted to cinema... - ... may cause a stage revolution. - Yes... ...we'll probably manage to discover theatre. You're definitely a reactionary. No! I'm simply a man who loves cinema. And who doesn't believe too much in its advances of a mechanical nature. Anyway, let's allow that time carries out its mission... - ...and now let's toast to the real cinema. - That's it! THE MERE SHOW CINEMA HAS BECOME ART SINCE THE INITIAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN OVERCOME AND WHAT WAS BORN AS A SIMPLE SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY HAS NOWADAYS A AESTHETICS. Three times six is eighteen! Three times seven is twenty-one! Three times eight...! Tomorrow I'll finish your mom's order and I'll send it to you. - Don't you forget it. - No, don't worry. Bye! - So, see you, Ana. Bye! - Bye! Give me the last issues of "Knitting" and "Select Films" Sorry, miss, the last issue of "Select Films" has been put aside. Too bad, I was really interested in reading that issue! - Could you get another one? - I'll try to. - Good morning, Mr. Dur?n. - Good morning. - Did you put aside "Select Films" for me? - Yes, sir. But I've been about to sell it to this young lady, who's really interested in purchasing it. Take the magazine. I can get another copy in the office. Do you write in "Select films"? Yes, madam, I'm... Carlos Dur?n. And I am... Pearl White's rival. What... Ana? Yes, Carlos. Kid, you're a grown woman already. And a pretty one, too. I almost prefer you to Pearl White. What has become of your parents? - Dad died in Africa. - I'm sorry. I'm still here with mom. She's in a very delicate condition, you know? I do crochet works at home. - And nobody is making love to you? - Some ones have tried to. Any luck for them? Not until now. Good night, Ana. Thanks. - How much is it? - 4,70, sir. Thanks a lot. Let's go inside. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Hello, Carlos. Have a seat. - How was your trip? - Wonderful. Besides I made the most of it to make a good documentary. A filmmaker even in your honeymoon. By the way, I've just read your last article. And I think I can guess what you'll like to direct. That's what I'm getting ready to. Well, I'm thinking now about expanding business with films production and distribution. What do you think about it? Great! So, can I count on your collaboration? Unconditionally. Of course my projects will have to wait until the next elections. Until then, keep filming the usual stuff. In the morning if you like, I'll film the rally of the Popular Front. Very well. And try to deliver all the stuff in the evening to the labs. All right, Mr. Sancho. All right, see you tomorrow. This delays my projects. As you can see, now is not a good time. Yes, it's true, I understand you. Anyway, you earned some holidays. - You can start whenever you want to. - Thank you. Thank you again. Oh, and don't you lose touch with me! Unexpected events might arise, and I'll need your camera. Don't worry Mr. Sancho, I'll bring you up to date on all my movements. There is a wonderful sea! I'm going for a dip! Oh, we forgot to bring the melon. As much as I like it! Aren't you going swimming? Now I must take good care of myself... for our son. Ana, Ana! I'll be right back! I'm a indulgent husband, right? Oh, Carlos! This afternoon in the Palace of the Regional Government of Catalonia... the Czech athletes who will take part in the popular Olympiad... have been wellcomed by the president. It is expected for tomorrow... the arrival of the French participants, who will be lodging together with the Soviets... at the hotels near Spain Square. From all the countries... concrete news are received, confirming that most of the young athletes of the world... will attend this popular Olympics... that have being organized to achieve a healthier and fairer life. At present, while the finishing... I have to get ready for the melon throw events. Would you like some more? No, thanks. Pass me the coffee. Madrid! The Government of the Popular Front... has gathered in an urgent meeting... in order to analyse the situation created by the uprising of the army in Moroco. In protest against the factious attitude of the reas under the rebel army... the UGT and CNT trade unions... have declared a general strike in all the country... and have offered their contingent of members... to safeguard the homeland peace. In the unions and official centers... armament is being handed out to people belonging to the Popular Front... who for the moment are keeping the traitors to the Republic at bay with their courage. We continue with a movies music program... offered to you by the lucky seller of lottery tickets, Mrs. Maria Illa. You'll listen to Schubert's Ave Maria, from the movie "Leise Flehen Meine Lieder". Did you hear the news? It seems to me that I'll have lots of work. Yes, but be careful. This time it seems to be much more serious. Bah, don't worry!, this will last two or three days. - You'll see! - From your lips to God's ears. For the moment, I remain very worried. In your condition you mustn't think about nonsense. All right? If you say so. What are you doing? A shirt. Did you want something? No, nothing. Thought about love. This is interesting for you. Love is born with us when we are born. Unamuno. The man who does not know love, is like who has been blind since birth. Neither one nor the other one will ever be able to know the world. La Rochefoucauld. Warning Spaniards, warning! Latest news about the military uprising in Morocco! The fights in the streets continue. Newscoming to this radio station... give the impression that the uprising is general in the whole of Spain and possessions. In Madrid, all the buildings and official centers are in the hands of the loyal forces who are fighting bravely to subdue the last seditious areas... that still resist without a chance to win... ...among the ruins of the Mountain Barracks and in Carabanchel's Camp. The faction groups of the organized unionism... are fitted quickly in militiamen's units... for the Republic's rescue. In Zaragoza and Bilbao there are a great many street gunfires. In many main cities of the country, numerous temples are burning. "Catalans, in a few moments, the president will speak to you... from the Generalitat Palace. " Don't worry. Go and have some rest. I'll clear the table. What's that? Don't worry, go to bed. We're going to really need your protection. Don't close the door! Yes sir, I heard the news. I will be prepared. Good night. ...controlled by the Generalitat. In this moment, the loyal to the Republic forces... are giving the last blows to the bastions of factious forces... in all the rebel strongholds in the peninsula. In our African positions... What's happening? Nothing. - Are you going out, Carlos? - Yes, I know why you're telling me this. Don't worry, I'll have something later. Be very careful. Long live the revolution! Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana! At your command, Sergeant. On Major's behalf you must report to the command post. All right. - With your permission? - Come in. - At your command, Major. - Hello, Dur?n. Good afternoon. Here I have your request to move on infantry. - Have you thought it over? - Yes, sir. Do you know the effect that this change might have for you? Yes, Major, but being an operator brings painful memories to my memory. I don't understand. My passion for cinema made me leave my wife in tragic circumstances, and that cost her life. I'm sorry. Good luck, Dur?n. I, honestly, am not convinced yet about color. I can assure you that Agfa Color is successful. When the war is over... Americans will produce almost all of his movies in Technicolor. - I'll believe it when I'll see it, I have my doubts. - Well, don't you doubt! The same thing that happened with the talkies will happen with color in films. - Hi, Carlos. - Hello, good afternoon. - A package and a letter have been brought for you. - Oh, yes? Mr. Carlos Dur?n Hostel Gran V?a - Barcelona Distinguished friend: Upon finding out about your new address and that you have been demobilized, it would be very pleasant for me, in these moments of reorganization, to be able to count on your collaboration. I send your camera, which tragic circumstances made you forget in the office. Come in. Will you have dinner, master? - No. - Aren't you having anything? - Bring me a cup of coffee with milk. - With a piece of toast? - Fine. - With a knob of butter? Fine. - With a little jam over? - Bring me whatever you want. Put it there. It's me. - Why did you take the trouble, darling? - You weren't going to bed without having dinner. - You loved her very much, didn't you? - Yes, I did. What a sweet face, and what a gentle look. Yes, she was wonderful, but I was to blame for the fact that that face and that look died out. - I'll never forget that it was my fault. - Don't think any more about it. She was one of many innocent victims of the war. - Yes, it's true but... - There, there. Let's go for a walk for a little while, you have to cheer up. Make a small effort and come to have dinner tonight with us. People say you are becoming an old, grumpy bear. - Luis! - Carlos! How's life? I've already heard from your theatrical successes. Ah, I can't complain, artist's life has its... Luis, this is Clara. Clara, this is Luis Vidal, my best friend. - Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, Clara. Well, I asked for your address to the editorial office, and here I am ready to get a room no matter what. I couldn't get a room in the whole city. - That is easy to sort out. - Sure. This lady will get you a good room. - I'll try to sort it out. - Well, come into my room and let's chat. - Let us know when dinner is ready. - Fine. Don't worry about the room, because you'll see how my landlady solves it. Let's hope it's true, because I'm fed up with roaming the streets... and finding no room to sleep. This house seems to be wonderful. - How do they treat you? - Very well, you'll see. - Which way does this balcony face to? - Towards the Gran Via. You are very well settled, boy You even have a cinema opposite! By the way, I haven't read for a long time any article of yours in professional magazines. - Cinema was over for me. - Well, I supposed so. Why? Stop talking nonsense, in truth you are looking forward to return. - Maybe you're right. - Of course. What you must do is wipe away from your mind once and for all that stupid memory... that's haunting you and that only you have created, and devote yourself entirely to your vocation. Anything but that is taking a false stance towards life, which I'm sure Ana herself should reproach you, because you, Carlos, whether you like it or not, you owe yourself to cinema. Come in. Dinner is ready. Come on, let's go. - Finally are you going to have dinner, Carlos? - Yes, we're having dinner and then we'll go to the movies. But, are you coming too? - Yes, tonight Carlos comes with us to the movies. - That's great! Then let's have dinner and I'll get ready in a moment. - What are we going to watch? - "Rebecca". I'm sure you'll be interested. You don't know anything of Hitchcock, do you? - Hitchcock? Isn't he the one of "39 steps"? - The same. - Wait for me in the dining room, I'll come right back. - Good. "Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. Then, like all dreamers, I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers... and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me. Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers? Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister Mrs. Lacy and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon. I'd like to know if you approve of the menu. Oh, well, I'm sure it's very suitable, very nice indeed. You'll notice, madam, that I've left a blank space for the sauce. Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces. Let's have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered. Where does that lead to? - Oh, it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat. - Oh, let's go down there. Oh, no, it's a perfectly dull, uninteresting stretch of sand, just like any other. - Oh, please. - Well, all right. We'll walk down and take a look, if you really want to. That's "Jasper". There must be something wrong. Perhaps he's hurt himself. - No, he's all right, leave him alone. - Don't you think I'd better go and see? Don't bother about him. He can't come to any harm. He'll find his own way back. She was lying on the divan, a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her. She looked ill, queer. Suddenly she got up, started to walk toward me. She said: When I have a child, neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn't yours. I'll be the perfect mother, just as I've been the perfect wife, No one will ever know. It ought to give you the thrill of your life, Max, to watch my son grow bigger day by day... and to know that when you die, Manderley will be his. She was face to face with me, Remember than the hand... holding a cigarette. She was smiling. Well, Maxim... what are you going to do about it? Aren't you going to kill me? I suppose I went mad for a moment. I must have struck her. Suddenly she stumbled and fell. I remember wondering why she was still smiling... then I realized she was dead. But you didn't kill her! It was an accident! Look, look. Remember that? It was a wonderful place. - Couldn't we come back sometime? - Of course. Look at you. When your grandchildren will see you, they'll be charmed to see how pretty you were. - That's what you are. - The same. Look at you, look at you. How funny! Careful, this is already in motion. - My love, when will you feel sorry for me? - Never. My life, my life, don't leave me. Hey, leave me but don't leave the frame. My love... You hear? It is finishing. I don't know what to say to you, man. What do you want me to say? - Say anything. - You silly! Very good, very good. Do you love me? Yes... No... Yes, no... Yes. Yes... Yes. Good morning, Luis. Isn't Carlos up yet? He got a great shock last night. - We did something stupid taking him there. - I didn't think he was going to be so affected. I'm going to call him. Good morning. Hi, Carlos. Excuse me about last night, I'm sorry you couldn't watch the end of the movie. Don't worry. Shall I order breakfast for you? Yes, order it. What a good beginning in "Rebecca". And what a great use of the voice in off. A marvellous, perfectly carried out performance, now I understand it's such a hit at the box office. At last Cinema overcame its absurd pessimism! Why don't you cheer up and we make a short movie? - Would you like it? - Very much. Then there'll be a movie! - And what will the matter be? - Oh, you'll see the script. Certainly you'll be the leading man. And what's my role here? Well... your assistance is very much appreciated, you know. You know my theory suggesting that the real creators are the author of the dramatic idea, and the performer. I believe that if the director is not at once the author of the idea his role is being a mere foreman. Almost, almost unnecessary. SHADOWS: Wonderful poem in images by the young director CARLOS DUR?N performed by the new leading man of the National Theatre LUIS VIDAL No wonder... Master Carlos... a gentleman, I don't remember his name, and who's a "I don't know what", wants to see you for something about cinema. Understood, send him in. Please. - Come in, Mr. Sancho. How are you? - Well, and you, Dur?n? Might I talk to you? Yes, come in. Sit down, please. You rude! Now they are talking. How silly he is! Now he says no. But now he says yes. Oh, what a creation I'm going to do. I will be better than Ingrid Bergman. They are happy. Now they are shaking hands. - You nosy! - Wow! You are the whole day with Master Carlos without leaving him to me for a moment, and now that I'm contemplating him at ease, you come to interrupt me. Now, don't be cross, darling. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the stellar show... is pleased to welcome the actor Luis Vidal, who's going to talk about his impressions on his great success achieved recently. Friend Vidal, do you want to say some words to our listeners? With great pleasure. I am deeply moved by this tribute you pay to me, and I'll try to do... I can't accept. I don't think I'm really trained to make long movies yet. Your friend Vidal is speaking on the radio. It must go intimately in life to a spirit of sacrifice... that overcomes the biggest discouragements. I owe my vocation to my great friend Carlos Dur?n... who could instil in me what he calls "the poison of cinema". This so current toxin which one can never refuse. Very interesting your words. Gentlemen, you just heard Luis Vidal, dedicating a thrilled memory to the great promise of our cinema Carlos Dur?n. In relation to him, my friend Vidal, will Carlos Dur?n direct the new film... in which you've been hired as leading man? I have an immense faith in Carlos Dur?n and in his cinematographic curiosity. He'll direct my movie! I'm so glad I've been the first one in transmitting for our listeners... this great news, and I wish both of you many successes. I do. It's very well. But you will put another extra headlight for me, right? - There, in No. 6. - Yes, sir. I don't know all this. Of course you know it, man. It's the old theater where we first met! Don't you see? Oh, yes. No wonder! Carlos, do you want to see this? How do you like it? Well, I don't like this. Do it again, please. - And Carlos? - I was told he had gone out. - Well, he isn't here. - Have they looked in his office? - I can't find Mr. Dur?n anywhere. - I am going to call home. - Yes, it's me. - Listen, is Carlos there? - He didn't tell you where he was going to? - No, he didn't. But isn't he there? I am going to see if he's in his room. I'm with him right away. Motors! Shoot. Action! Just a moment, gentleman, just a moment. Say cheese. Like this. Music makes my customers' smiles more beautiful. THE END
