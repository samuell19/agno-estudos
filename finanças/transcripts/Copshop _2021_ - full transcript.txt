[dramatic music] [light whooshing] [atmosphere ringing] [rock thudding] [wind howling] [atmosphere rumbling] [spray paint hissing] [pleasant trumpet music] [wind howling] [insects buzzing] [intense music] [gun clicking] [gun whooshing] [exciting beat music] [engine rumbling] [police sirens alarming] [tires screeching] [car horn honking] Oh, what's that? What's what? The box with the bow. My daughter Sasha's turning 21 in two days. Clem's brother's got a really good hookup resale in Laughlin. You got her a gun? [Sergeant] I just told you she's turning 21. You got her a gun from a roach coach. So Clem's one-stop shop for life shortening and shit? Cheeseburgers, guns. Does he deep fry bullets? He might. You can damn near deep fry anything these days. I never got a gun when I turned 21. I don't know what you talking about. How much you spend on that Ruger, rookie? Which is a single action weapon from the ass end of the 1800s and damn near useless in a 21st century gunfight. It's not the brush. It's the artist. [tires screeching] [car horns honking] [intense beat music] [driver coughing] [engine clanking] [Driver] Fuck! [ominous music] - [Radio Dispatcher] - Units are clear for 10-11. Possible ABW. Code five at Indian Springs Casino. Unit to clear? - Shit. - Three over 20, responding in route. Goddamn it! Can't even fucking eat in peace. [exciting funk music] Can't even enjoy this meal! [police sirens alarming] Shit! [exciting funk music] - [police siren alarming] - This is a fucking mess. [crowd shouting] I'm gonna let you finish that heart attack and I'm gonna go protect and serve. [Sergeant] Be right there, rookie. I protect and serve better on a full stomach. Hey, break it up! [crowd shouting] Break it up! Break it up, hey, hey! Break it up, break it up! [crowd shouting] She's gonna drop that guy! Hey, what kind of wedding is this? [women gasping] [gunshot booming] [people screaming] Now which one of you wanna spend the night in county lockup? [police siren alarming] That's what I thought. [punch thudding] Oh! World star! I did not mean to lean into that, lady, I'm really sorry. - Hands in the air! - Get on the ground! Which one of you are gonna arrest me? - Let's go! - All right, - somebody arrest me! - Down, down! [Male Officer] On the ground! Get on the ground! [Criminal] Will one of you people please fucking arrest me... [taser buzzing] [electrical buzzing] [man groaning] Oh! Woo! [crowd applauding] You're under arrest. [electrical buzzing] [man groaning] Oh my God. [muffled beat music] [ominous music] [somber funk music] [engine rumbling] [entry bell ringing] [Rookie] Kim! Coming. Well what do we have here? Picked up a boy toy for you, Kim. [Kim] Aren't you just the sweetest thing on God' green at 4 A.M. Look at this pretty blue purse. [Criminal] Get me cell. The only cell you're getting is the one you're spending the night in. [faint radio chattering] [ominous music] [Kim] Lord, honey, what happened to your eye? This charming man. [Kim] Hit a woman? [ominous music] Teddy, you're bleeding. A lot. Whoa, what the hell is this? [Rookie] Bullet by, he got shot. [Sergeant] Get him downstairs, get him stitched up. Maybe the boredom will get him talking. Damn, your momma didn't love you at all. [cop laughing] My God. What the fuck? [somber jazz music] [people chatting] [Barnes] I mean I know of. I never watched, I never watched that. [phone buzzing] Hey! What the hell is going on? Who's on intake? Last week, you's bitching about not getting enough overtime and now here you are jawing away like a bunch of fucking old ladies! Get back to work! Sorry, Mitchell. Sorry, Mitch, my ass. Officer Huber! Where the fuck are my evidence inventories? The ones I've been asking for for two weeks. I'm on it. I'm on it. I hate that fucking phrase. I prefer get it fucking done! Is there some kind of goddamn inside bet to raise my damn blood pressure every fucking second of every goddamn day? [ominous music] [Young Cop] Looks like a cop car. [Older Cop] Central to state, 10, Ottis, 10. [Young Cop] Shit load of bullets everywhere. 10, Ottis, 10. - [Young Cop] - Windows are busted. [Older Cop] 10, Ottis, 10. Kim, get the fuck out the damn bathroom! Jesus Christ. Got the bladder of a fucking toddler. This is 50, over. We have an 11-55 up Area Road. Found a Crown Vic with a dash lamp. I can't find it registered anywhere. Vehicle's also shot up. Copy, 10, Ottis, 10. Clarify shot up, please. - Do you mean bullets... - Hey, stop buddy! - Stop! - Yeah. - Shoot, look out! - [car smashing] [tires screeching] [horn honking] What the fuck? [Young Cop] What the fuck? 10, Ottis, 10, is everything okay? [man groan] [man grunting] Copy, 10, Ottis, 10. This is 50, over. - Bad fucker. - [glass shattering] What the fuck? [man groaning] [body thudding] [Young Cop] Stay down! Stay the fuck down! [Older Cop] What the fuck is wrong with you? [Young Cop] He's drunk off his ass. - 10, Ottis, 10. - Stand up! [Mitchell] Is everything okay? Doing a little drinking tonight, asshole? [drunk laughing] You've been doing a lot more than a little. Damn. [Mitchell] 10, Ottis, 10, is everything okay? [car thudding] [Older Cop] You almost killed a state trooper, you dumb fuck! [Mitchell] Do you need assistance? 10, Ottis, 10. - Get him in there. - Get in there. [Older Cop] This is 10, Ottis, 10. Some goddamn drunk almost run us down just now. Can we process him at your station? Yeah, it's a slow night, bring him down. All right, 50, we're at 10-80. Give us 30 minutes. [Mitchell] All right now. - Out. - You all right? Fucking overtime, my ass. [ominous music] You've got fragmentation here, Teddy. Someone trying to kill you? Is that why you were trying to get arrested tonight? They got your ass ice cold, Teddy. You assaulted an officer, that's aggravated battery. That's mandatory 12 to 18 in county. So I would take advantage of my minuscule amount of sympathy for you getting shot and talk. [ominous music] You know, I had this boyfriend in high school. Curtis Flores. My father didn't care for him, not that he liked any of my boyfriends, but he always said about Curtis, "Honey," "that boy is never more than a day ahead of the devil." Curtis. Curtis sounds like a gem. Whatever happened to him? He was stabbed and killed in the parking lot of an Applebee's. He let the day get past him. And the devil was right there. [ominous music] Hey, Sarge. Hey. We got an unmarked Crown Vic full of bullet holes just found abandoned by state troopers. That meaning anything to you, Teddy? I want my phone call now. [phone dial tone buzzing] [Woman] Operator. Name of the person you're trying to reach. - Lorraine Faith. - Law enforcement officials... - F-A-I-T-H. - Appear no closer to solving the brutal murder of Nevada Attorney General William Fenton, who was found slain. Some of the top police officers and detectives on the case. [Operator] Please hold. Can't release any names. As you know, we're still gathering as much information as possible, but, rest assured, we will continue to work very hard to find the people responsible. Thank you. [Dial tone buzzing] Come on, fucking pick up. - Hey, it's Lorraine. - Fuck! [Lorraine] I can't get to the phone right now. Leave a message at the beep. [phone beeping] Hey, listen, it's me again. I need you to get the fuck out of the house, okay? Take Ryan and go somewhere, go anywhere. Do you understand me? I sent you the combination, check your texts. Check your texts, nothing is safe, nothing is safe. [Rookie] Time's up, Teddy. Nothing. [keys jingling] Okay. [cuffs clinking] You can let go. I didn't get to her. Damn. [Teddy] Let me just check my cell. You know, how about you just give me the code to your cell? I'll check it for you. Got something to hide? [Teddy] Just let me check my phone. Let me check my cell. How's that gonna hurt you? [foreboding music] [door alarm buzzing] [keys jingling] [door alarm buzzing] All right. State law requires that we keep our intoxicated guests in separate quarters. So you got the place all to yourself. [gate clanking] Hands. I didn't mean to hit you so hard. Aw, aren't you sweet. Get comfortable, Teddy. You're gonna be here awhile. [drunk groaning] Holy shit! He smells like Satan's asshole. - Am I home? - Yeah, this dip shit nearly killed us. Bounced his car off that abandoned Crown Vic and put it in the ditch. All right, well, I'll get you a lovely night stay in here on a stainless steel cot [drunk groaning] Any ID? - None. - Driver's license, social security? What the hell is this? All right, John Doe it is. What the hell is this? [Drunk] It's... My insulin. [Young Cop] What is that? Is he saying insulin? [Drunk] I need a, I need a shot. Talking about diabetes. You're diabetic, aren't you? Not every fat guy has diabetes. Can I get a prisoner escort down to processing, please? How is that workout coming along? Oh yeah, I gave up on the workouts. [Older Cop] Make some life decisions, man. [Kim] Yeah, making the decision not to work out. [ominous music] [alarm buzzing] [Rookie] Yeah. - I know. - Think he shit himself. [door alarm buzzing] No, no, no, no. We're not in there, we're not in there. We're over here. [Drunk] You guys stink of booze. There you go. - Yo, I got him. - Hold him, Ruby. [door clanking] [keys clicking] [Ruby] You okay? You okay, big guy? [Drunk] I'm okay. All right. [drunk thudding] [officers laughing] [Pena] The bunk is to your right. Come on, stop. Stop. - He just ate the floor. - You see that shit? [Pena] Hey, it never happened. [Teddy] You got any food? I'm famished. Just loaf. What the hell is loaf? [Pena] If you're into dry dog shit, it's delicious. This just ain't your night, Teddy. [door alarm buzzing] [door alarm buzzing] [ominous music] What are you in for? What are you in for? I sucker punched a cop. No, that's not what you're in for. You're in for a lot more than that. [ominous music] What'd you do? Did what I had to do... to get in here. To get to you, Teddy. [sinister music] Now, it's important you listen carefully. - Don't have much time. - Hey! - Hey! - Hey, Teddy. Somebody! - Hey! - Listen to me. 914 Glenview Crest, apartment number 16. Who lives there? A woman and a boy. [door alarm buzzing] What in the fuck are you guys going on about? [door creaking] Shut the fuck up! I just want my food, man, I want my food. You shouldn't eat loaf after midnight. That shit will give you nightmares! The big black kind. Get me a hot dog. Please. Shut the fuck up! You guys keep fucking with me, I'm gonna bring the hose in on both of y'all bitch asses! [Drunk] Sorry. [electronic beeping] [door alarm buzzing] [door thudding] [drunk whistling] What do they want? You know what they want. Can we make a deal? Listen, Teddy. I don't want you to think that you can save yourself because you obviously can. But there are other considerations. Like my ex, is that what you're talking about, my ex? Like I give a shit. The kid ain't even mine, man. [foreboding music] All right. What guarantees you give me to spare her? Huh? Guarantees I'm gonna give, Teddy. You know how this goes. All right, it's up to you where I go next. You can't do shit to me in here, pal. [Teddy chuckling] You know what, actually, you can't do a fucking thing. [somber music] Okay. What okay? What's that? What okay? It is what it is, Teddy. [ominous music] What do you mean, it is what it is? My ex and my kid. They alive? [foreboding music] [Mitchell] Officer Huber! You on a play date or something? Where the fuck are my evidence inventories? [eerie music] [suspenseful beat music] [machine beeping] [door clanking] [keys jingling] [ominous music] [doorknob clattering] [keys jingling] [intense music] There he is. Keeping you in the cage. [Huber chuckling] You finally getting those inventories straightened out? I'm trying. Fucking Mitchell wants everything letter perfect. Yeah, it's a pain in my ass. Yeah, I bet. Are you good otherwise? Otherwise, what? I'm worried about you, man. Grown-ass fucking men don't worry about other grown-ass fucking men, Barnes. I'm fine, I'm just... I'm tired of Mitchell's bullshit. Yeah, I feel you. He wouldn't do it if he didn't love you. [Huber chuckling] Right. Look, you don't have to tell me but if you ever need to talk, chat, shoot the shit, - whatever. - I'm good, man, but you don't have to worry about me. [Barnes] Okay. I'm good. [News Anchor] Law enforcement officials appear no closer to solving the brutal murder of Nevada Attorney General William Fenton who was found slain. We will continue to work both at the local and state level to bring the person or persons responsible for these senseless murders to justice. Yeah, first 48, turn to 72, turn to 96. It's embarrassing. Makes only the Attorney General of Nevada. This fucking guy, Murretto, has been busted more times than I've made busts. 22 arrests and no charges. How does that happen? - [gun cranking] - There it is. What are you doing? I'm working on my rodent roulette. - Rodent roulette. - [gun cranking] Yeah, see, in Indiana we used a pistol on everything. Squirrels, rabbits. So my dad came up with this thing. You take one round, drop it in the wheel, spin it. It's gotta land on that cylinder. [gun clicking] Squirrel shooting. And were you any good? Did you get any squirrels? [Pena] I never did, my dad did. Hmm. So you were a failure in the eyes of your father? That tracks. That's cool. See, you're all cocky now because you got that fancy Blackhawk. You didn't think I noticed that? Oh, I'm surprised you noticed it sitting all comfy, cozy on my hip. I'll quick draw you for it. My Redhawk [gun clicking] races your Blackhawk. [gun clicking] I got 30 seconds. [computer beeping] Don't let the Sarge see us dicking around okay? [Pena] Wanna do this? - Oh yeah. - Today? - [dramatic music] - [Valerie] All right. You ready, gunslinger? It's your move, cowgirl. [dramatic music] [guns clicking] - Ah! - Ah! [Valerie laughing] [gun clicking] Officer down. Officer down. You know what, speed kills. Oh, I can put my scrubby fingers on it? - Every time. - [printer buzzing] Get quicker, man. Let Pop see me, he'd be disappointed. [gun cranking] [somber music] I know who you are, pal. I've heard all about you. Legendary Bob Viddick. Some chilling shit floating around about you. Some poor bastard in Tampa. You cut off his arm with a carving knife and then you beat him to death with that same arm, right? It was his leg. [eerie music] I've heard about you too, Teddy. Say you're very effective. How you're not dead a dozen different ways by now is a cross between a fluke and a fucking miracle. More magic trick than anything, really. Mind over matter. I get people what they want. And take more than you need. Yeah. Hey, what do you say we cut all the bullshit? You wanna live. That'd be nice. Right, and you still think that's possible because you haven't been paying attention. So you try to buy your way out. Let's make a deal, man, I got a lot of money. You mean the money you stole from them? What we fail to understand, Teddy, is it's not about the money anymore. There's no play here, Teddy, no deal to be made. It's a simple choice. It's never simple. [Bob chuckling] Are you a fucking idiot? It is that simple. [watch beeping] I'm running out of time, Teddy. So they're running out of time. [ominous music] Huber! This is fucking bullshit! Will somebody get fucking Huber up here, please? [somber jazz music] [Valerie knocking] Oh, I'm sorry. Are you Huber? You have an open door policy. I also have a no pain in the ass policy, but you don't seem to pay any attention to that. 22 arrests, zero convictions. Who? Our mystery man, Teddy Murretto. Have we impounded that abandoned Crown Vic yet? Yeah, I just sent Ruby and Barnes out to meet the tow truck driver. Did you read the state trooper's report? Why in the hell would I read the state trooper's report when I'm buried in evidence inventories that don't make any goddamn sense? Will somebody please get Huber up here now? You know, you have a phone. There was a cherry light and a siren mount on the dash. Okay? So here's my theory. Teddy either stole that unmarked off a cop or he's impersonating a cop. He's a fucking total bullshitter. Wait him out because we can hold him indefinitely. Yeah. Huber! If you are within the sound of my goddamn voice, get your big ass up here! Don't make me come looking for you! This motherfucker gonna make me come looking for him. [toilet flushing] [ominous music] Hub! Huber, you in here? Shit. Don't have time for this fucking shit. Anybody have eyes on Huber? Kim, you see him, tell him to get his ass in my office right now! [ominous music] Listen to me, this is harassment, okay? I'm doing everything that I can. I've probably gotten about a key and a half out of evidence. Do you have any fucking idea what that entails? What could happen to me if I... I know I owe you. Yes. [Huber gasping] [eerie music] What do I need to do? [water spraying] [watch beeping] [man farting] [man groaning] [man sniffling] [man huffing] Fucking. [man vomiting] Fuck Fireball, dude. This fucking hangover's gonna be a motherfucking bitch if I don't get some aspirin here too. [urination trickling] Aspirin is bad for your liver. Cool dude, thanks. You a fucking doctor? Yup. Got my degree from the University of Common Sense. [urination trickling] Huh? Yeah, I didn't think you studied there. [ominous music] Huh? I'm getting a sinking suspicion that "huh" is the word that best describes you. I'm getting a fucking suspicion... [toilet flushing] Fucking, fuck you, dude. [watch beeping] What do you got there? [Bob shushing] [ominous music] Just a minute. [gas hissing] [Kim sniffing] What the fuck? What the fuck? [sinister music] - [watch alarm beeping] - Are you fucking setting an alarm to remind you to get your ass kicked? I wouldn't poke the bear, pal. Huh? Oh, there it is again. What? Oh, that's good, change it up. "Huh? What?" Keep 'em guessing. - [man laughing] - Dude. Don't make me fuck you up in her, all right, man? You look like a fucking stepdad. I will slap the shit out of you. You're looking at a real one, son. I don't give a shit! You feel me? [alarm beeping] [punch thudding] [intense music] I felt that. Hey! [bars banging] Help! Hey, somebody help! [punch thudding] Hey! Help! [man gagging] Hey! - Help! - Hey! Hey, help! Hey, somebody! He's having a seizer! - False alarm, guys. - [alarm ringing] I got something that caught fire in one of these evidence bins. And can someone please bring me a fucking fire extinguisher up here? [Valerie] We're on it. - [alarm ringing] - Jesus Christ, that's loud. What the fuck is happening? Where you been, Huber? Sarge looking for you. His voice carries. [alarm ringing] Hey, who's this? That's the douche bag that clocked Young at the casino. [Huber chuckling] Is he still down in holding? - Help! - Oh my God! Somebody come and help this man! He's gonna die! [Bob laughing] Situation in holding! Get your ass down to holding now! [Bob and Teddy shouting] [door lock beeping] He's gonna die! [Teddy shouting] He's gonna die! He's foaming at the mouth. - It's not a seizure! - It's like he's got rabies! He did it! He did it, he did it! Oh my gosh! Don't go in there! [Bob] He's not gonna make it, please help him! What the fuck happened? Watch your back! Prisoner who doesn't appear to be breathing. Hey, watch your back! Oh no! [stick crunching] [Mitchell groaning] [alarm ringing] [sinister music] [gunshots booming] [Teddy screaming] Oh, shit! Shit! We got shots fired, we got shots fired! Help! Help, he's trying to fucking kill me! Somebody! [gun clicking] [alarm ringing] You seem to have sobered up. I'm gonna need you to drop that gun and lower yourself as flat as a board to the floor for me. [alarm ringing] You're shaking. Yeah, I'm nervous. It's amazing I haven't blown your fucking head off. You assaulted my sergeant and are attempting an escape. There's not a jury in Nevada that will blah, blah, blah. Drop that fucking gun! Now! [alarm muting] [sinister music] [Bob chuckling] All right. [door alarm buzzing] [gun clanking] What the hell happened? We need an ambul in here now. Check Sarge. [Pena] Was he shot? No but he was attacked. And get the other guy up to infirmary now. He's having trouble breathing. - Oh shit. - Laceration to the head. Give me a right wrist. Anything I can do to help, officer? - Yeah, shut the fuck up. - [handcuff cranking] [Teddy] I'll be right here if you need anything. [Valerie] Move! What the fuck are you looking at him for? [Pena] Val, you good? Yeah. Cuff it right there, to your left. [man grunting] [handcuff cranking] Show me. - Wanna check 'em? - [door lock buzzing] Sit down. Sarge, sit up. [Mitchell groaning] All right. Look at me. All right, I think you dislocated your jaw. I'm gonna have to reset it. I'm gonna stick my thumbs in your mouth. One. Two, three. [jaw cracking] [Mitchell yelping] Okay. Let's get up. Let's get up. [ominous music] All right, get to the infirmary. [gate clanking] [door lock buzzing] - Get the goddamn door. - That's what I'm doing! [Pena groaning] Here we go. All right, all right. This guy's been like fucking... Get him up, up, up to there! [Pena groaning] All right, Sarge, I got you. Sit her. [Mitchell groaning] - Kimble! - Huber! [Pena] What's with the - fucking ambulance! - Help Sarge! [Kim] Give me a sec, I'm checking on it. This guy's bleeding like a fucking geyser. [Huber] You're all right, Sarge. [Valerie] I think his windpipe is crushed. What do you mean it's crushed? What're you doing? [Valerie] I'm gonna have to open up his airway so he can breathe. No, let's wait on the ambul. [Valerie] Wait on the ambulance? Hey, buddy, buddy, it's gonna be all right. Just calm down, just calm down. It's okay. Hey, let's just wait for the doctor. All right, I did this in army medical before on a cadaver. On a fucking cadaver? Was it a cadaver before you started? Are you fucking kidding me? I'm nervous, I make bad jokes when I'm nervous. Well refrain, all right, let me focus. [man gurgling] Wait, aren't you left-handed? - Shut the fuck up! - Fuck yeah, you're left-handed! Fuck, just wait, are you sure? Let's just wait on the ambulance. [man gagging] Oh gosh. [man gurgling] [blood squelching] Okay. Oh. All right. [blood squelching] [liquid bubbling] Want me to steady that? Yeah. Oh, he's breathing. Is he breathing? Hey, we did... We did it. That's how you... All right. [Pena] That was fucking badass. Keep an eye on him. That was fucking badass, seriously. [ominous music] Hey. This is Huber. I was told to call you. Yeah. Yes. [foreboding music] Kim? [suspenseful tempo music] [computer keys clicking] [computer beeping] Fuck. [Kim] Ah-ooo-gah! Jesus fuck, Kimble! [Kimble laughing] Don't do that. Motherfucker, what are you in my biz for? How long does it take for. IAFIS to turn around prints, usually? They don't prioritize DUIs. What does that mean? It's gonna take awhile. What's got you so curious? Curiosity. [door lock buzzing] [somber drum music] Let's you and me talk, man to man. Never more than a day ahead of the devil, huh? [Valerie chuckling] Tell me, Teddy. [Teddy] Tell you what? Tell me why Mr. Meryl Streep, back there, faked a DUI to get into this station for a shot at killing you. I don't know. Why don't you ask him? Bob Viddick. Why are you trying to kill him? What do you care? You don't even like him. [Teddy laughing] Why is he trying to kill you, Teddy? Okay. Let's do this. You can tell me everything, and I mean every last fucking thing, or option two, you can keep smart-assing me, shrugging off my questions with that stupid fucking look on your face, and I'll put you and your pal in the same cell together. You're not gonna do that. [keys jingling] Let's not be ridiculous. Seriously. You can't do it. You're not allowed to do it, remember? Stop fucking around. I'm as far away from fucking around as you can possibly get! You still drunk? Sober as a judge. Hmm. You gonna fuck with me? Nope. Not you. Problem solved. Look, this is way beyond anything you want to get involved with, lady. - You don't fucking understand. - No, you don't understand how incredibly fucking bored I am. Okay. Fuck it. You want to know? I'll tell you. [upbeat jazz music] All right, what I do, my profession. I put people together, high profile people, like-minded, shared interests. Movers and shakers kind of shit. Cops, politicians, entrepreneurs, heads of state. I handled them all. Call it high-end consultancy. You're a fixer. No, I hate that fucking term, I don't fix. I manufacturing opportunities. She doesn't have to get hurt, Teddy. What he knows, you don't need to know. I'm all ears. [somber jazz music] You read the papers? That's mostly what I do here. So you know about the Nevada attorney general that was murdered last week, Fenton? [door knocking] [Woman] Bill, motion's done. [Teddy] Now, the people I work for, they got their hooks into everything. [Woman] Just need you to sign it so I can file. [Teddy] And when I say everything in the state of Nevada, [woman screaming] I'm talking about the gaming industry. [ominous music] [woman screaming] [Woman] Oh my God! That is the summit from which everything else flows forth. Now my job is simple. I keep them talking, I keep them happy. This guy, Fenton, ah, he was a crusader. So you tried to buy him off. [Teddy] Multiple times. And he wasn't biting. Not even a nibble. But when they clipped Fenton, walls came crumbling down. He recorded everything I said with him and he used that as leverage to get me to roll. Teddy, you're about to purger yourself with people that will butcher your entire fucking bloodline! If you don't come clean, I can't help you. [somber jazz music] The feds offered me a deal. I took the deal. What kind of deal? Reciprocal. I'm invisible, that's what I'm gonna... Get people to turn. What do you mean, what the fuck am I talking about? I got the heat all over me. High level people with their hands in the mix. Listen to me, don't bust my balls on this, all right? And then one night, I almost got accidented. [engine rumbling] [explosion booming] What does that mean? [Teddy screaming] [Teddy] They almost blew me the fuck up. [exciting funk music] [Teddy gasping] [Teddy screaming] So I had to go underground. Disappear. Why don't you tell her about the money, Teddy? I haven't heard you mention the money once. What money? Go on, Teddy, now that we're all sharing. Tell her about the millions you siphoned off and stashed away somewhere. The feds knew about the money. Bullshit. [Teddy] It's not bullshit. Lady, this guy will roll in your fucking guts given the opportunity. I'll take my chances. Hard chargers get charged hard. What does that mean? You don't know? It means, if you push too much then you get pushed back hard. But that doesn't sound as cool. But it's meant to be helpful. What the fuck do you think I said it for? Okay, well, all right, thank you. Thank you. All right. Take me through the last 24 hours. The gunshot wound, the Crown Vic, et cetera. All of it. [somber jazz music] [Teddy] A pair of Vegas' finest drove me out of town to, quote, "deliver me to the FBI," unquote. It was bullshit. These cops are bent. I had a date with a hole in the desert. Thank God the feds were shadowing me or I'd been totally fucked. [tires screeching] [Man] FBI! [Teddy] Hey! Hey! - [Agent] Drop your weapons! - [gunshots popping] - [Teddy] Goddamn it! - [gunshots popping] [Teddy thudding] [gunshots popping] [agent yelping] Oh, what the fuck? [gunshots booming] [men shouting] [Agent] Stop him! [gunshots booming] [glass clinking] [gunshot booming] [engine rumbling] Fuck! [gunshot booming] [glass shattering] [exciting rock music] Teddy Murretto does not die, motherfucker! [Valerie] This is Young, down in holding. Kim, you around? Right here, sugar. [Valerie] Are Barnes and Ruby still off site? Uh. They're on their way back with a tow truck. All right, have the tow truck continue on here but ask Barnes and Ruby if they can reroute to the old Nomad Motel out on Route 95, just north of Lee Canyon. Possible crime scene, multiple shooting victims. [Kim] There hasn't been a call out. I know, just have them radio once they're on scene. [ominous music] It's gonna be all right, Sarge. We're going to take care of everything. [door buzzing] How you feeling, Sarge? All right. He good? Yeah, yeah, he's still breathing. Is that ambulance coming from Reno? They're fucking taking forever. I'll ask Kimble to call them again. Don't let him fall asleep. [Huber] I got him. [ominous music] Six, Charles, 12, this is central. [Barnes] It's Barnes. Barnes, give me one second, I got Young coming up right now. [Valerie] Kim? [Kim] I got Barnes at the motel. All right, I need you to find that ambul for me, please. Got it. Barnes. Yeah, Young, what're we supposed to be seeing out here? Any signs of a shootout? Shell casings, blood spatter, drag marks. Need an update on ambulance, please. [Barnes] No, nothing. All right, thanks. About 10 minutes on that ambulance. Bad accident on the 15, southbound. Backed up traffic. Okay, can you do me a favor and run a name for me? Bob, or Robert, Viddick. Try spelling variations on that last name. Who is he? I think he might be our John Doe downstairs. Have the scans sent back from my office? No, not yet. Huber already asked. [ominous music] About what? The prints, John Doe. Why the fuck is Huber asking about that? Can I ask you a personal question, Teddy? [Teddy] I don't see why not. You had it all. They took good care of you, didn't they? Money, women, whatever. Why in the hell would you give that up? You could've kept going. You know, they would've never let you go down. You'd never see the inside of a courtroom or that cell. You should've just kept going. I don't do shoulda, woulda, coulda. No, you just light your entire fucking life on fire, run as fast as you can, hoping that'll put out the flames. You know what you've never been? Not once. Tell me, Teddy. You never been forced down a fucking rabbit hole, making life and death decisions, Bob. I do that every fucking day, - Teddy. - No, you don't. Those aren't decisions, those directives. Kill this guy, kill that guy. Wipe out that family, fucking vanish another one. You're a psychopath, Bob, plain and simple. I'm not a psychopath, Teddy. I'm a professional. And there's a difference? You'll know it when you see it. [Valerie] What about this other guy, Viddick? I'm not familiar with him. Probably a cut-out. Notched. Mob mostly contracts third party participants for heavy lifting like this. These are distinctly bad people, officer. So the quicker we can get Murretto moved, the better. We found the bodies of his ex-wife and son last night, floating in a runoff slew near Lake Mead. Shit. Listen, Teddy Murretto has made more enemies than I can count. So, what did he tell you about this little daring escape he pulled off? [Valerie] Said a pair of crooked cops got ambushed by the feds and touched off a big gunfight. Have you turned up anything on that? No. [ominous music] Not a thing. Thank you. [men grunting] [Goon] That's it. Yeah. All right. [sinister music] [dial beeping] [dial tone buzzing] Yeah, we got a big fucking problem. [water splashing] We got a cop in Gun Creek asking too many fucking questions. [door lock buzzing] My kid okay? You get in contact with my ex? I talked to a detective at Vegas PD and they're gonna send a car and do a wellness check. I'm sure everything's fine. Let me check my cellphone. You can't check - your cellphone, Teddy. - Let me just check it. - Let me check it. - I'm sorry. She's got information from me that could put her in danger, okay. - When Vegas PD... - She's probably trying... - Reaches back out... - Text me or call me, - she doesn't know what to do. - I'll let you know. I'll let you know. [sinister music] [door lock buzzing] Robert K. Viddick. Known associates. What do we have here? [muffled funk music] Well don't these guys look like a bunch of fucking assholes. [eerie music] [man whistling tune] [foreboding music] Anthony Lamb. [Doorbell ringing] What kind of jerk off name is that? Manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, battery. [eerie music] [bell ringing] I have birthday balloon bouquet for. Officer Huber. You look just like this fucking ass bag down here. [Anthony] Oh, come on, now. You're kidding. No, you gotta check this out. - Look at this. - What? You look just like him. The resemblance is fucking uncanny. Now what are the odds? [gunshot popping] [Kim clattering] Oh! Hold on there, buddy. Hold steady now. Oh, the boat's a rockin'. Oh, I'd love to know what's going through your mind. [glass shattering] [doorbell ringing] [Blonde EMT] Sorry, guy, traffic was a bitch. [Brunette EMT] What do we got? Thank God you're here, he took quite a spill. He's right back here. [Blonde EMT] Holy shit. [Brunette EMT] Check vitals. [Blonde EMT] I got no pulse. [Brunette EMT] You say... You say he fell? Yeah. Yeah, well, to clarify, I shot him in the head and then he took a little tumble. [gunshots popping] [eerie music] Woo. Dang. What? Are you? Is that your blood right on my head, where I shot you on your head? Imagine that. Anthony J. Lamb, you gotta buy yourself a lottery ticket today. Oh, I hope they're power balling. [Anthony sighing] [ominous music] Kimble! Where the fuck's that ambul, man? Oh, shit. What the fuck? Hey, who the fuck are you? Hey, hey, I'm calling for help, man! [Pena] Easy, easy, easy! Goddamn! What the fuck happened? I'm just the balloon man, man. I'm calling for help, buddy. [gunshot booming] [eerie music] Goddamn, son. Didn't you? What is the first rule of policing, huh? Beware the unusual element. And in this scenario, I believe that it is me. Officer, well, officer formerly known as... Pena. Pena. [Anthony chuckling] - Get down, motherfucker! - [ominous music] Flat as a board! Get... [rapid gunfire popping] What the fuck was that? [intense music] [gunshot popping] I used to be a much better man. [sinister music] [man gurgling] [gunshots booming] [intense music] [gunshots booming] [sparks fizzling] [door thudding] What the fuck was that? [Bob sighing] [metal clanking] [buttons beeping] [rapid gunfire popping] [glass clinking] [buttons beeping] [rapid gunfire popping] No shit now. [rapid gunfire popping] [gun cranking] [dramatic music] [buttons beeping] [bullets clinking] [rapid gunfire popping] [electronic beeping] [glass shattering] Hola! [gun clicking] Well, that fucking blew. [gunshots booming] [rapid gunfire popping] [metal popping] How bad is it? You happen to hear all that gunfire? Are you a fucking idiot, Teddy? That question persists. I ain't talking about the gunfire. Fuck me. [Valerie groaning] Oh, fuck. You gotta be fucking shitting me. [Valerie sighing] Guy was firing what looked like a snug-barreled submachine gun. Those use nine millimeter ammo. This bullet in my stomach is a 44 caliber... rico. What does that mean? Ricochet. It means she shot herself. It means I fucking shot myself. Yeah, it's me. Come let me out of the cell, okay? You don't know what's going on up there and you are wounded bad. You're gonna bleed out. Young, you know me. This is Young. I'm trapped down here in holding with two detainees and I've been shot in the abdomen. [ominous music] Pena and Kimble have been killed. Be aware. We have an armed assailant on site. He is outside the cell block at present, over. [eerie music] [glass scraping] Damn. [Teddy] Young, you don't have much time. You're bleeding out. Get me out of this cell, come on, I can help you. You have no idea what's going on up there. You ware wounded badly. [Young banging] Get me the fuck out of here. [metal clanking] [Young sighing] [Valerie] Ouch. [gun cranking] [gunshots popping] [Anthony yelping] Damn. Now that does appear to be bulletproof. [Valerie huffing] Goddamn! Woo! [Anthony laughing] Anthony Lamb. Is that big, bad Bob Viddick? Sideshow Bob, what the fuck are you doing in there? You know this whack job? Yeah, he's... Young miss law-and-order, how about you open his door, we wrap this up real quick and I get the hell out your hair toot sweet, huh? Theodore Murretto. I'll be a fucking monkey's uncle. Look at you in there. One of male grooming's greatest misfires, the man bun. You look like Tom Cruise in that Samurai picture that nobody watched. Goddamn. Bob, what's happening in there? Yeah, hey, Anthony? You know what, Bob, I'm sorry, I'm going by the more friendly and less formal, Tony, these days, I know it's been a minute. Hey, Anthony, I'm gonna need you to clear off this contract. Oh, no can do, Bob. This contract is free fire, as there are competing parties for on Theodore Murretto. [Bob] Hey, Anthony. You know, I'm not responding to that name. Anthony? Yeah, I'm not responding to that fucking name, Bob. You heard me! Doesn't Joe Tatino in Chicago have a $65,000 sticker on your head? He does indeed, Bob. And all he's gotten back are the heads of the assholes he's sent to collect mine. Clear off my contract now, Anthony, or as God as my witness, I'm gonna cut off your fucking head, put it in a bag and drive it to Chicago, I shit you not! Meow! Is that the gauntlet you've thrown down there, Bob? Are we gonna duel to the death? [ominous music] [Anthony huffing] Well if so, I've foreseen some terrible things for you in the not too distant future, Bob. I drew you a dick. It just got weird. Well, it's gonna get weirder. You like this action, Murretto? Murretto? I'm coming in there whether you like it or not. [Anthony growling] Now you see the difference? That is a psychopath. [sinister tempo music] 10-13. This is Officer Valerie Young. I am gravely wounded in the subfloor detention block at the Gun Creek City police headquarters. Copy. Can anyone hear me? 10-13. Officer in dire medical need, over. [sinister music] [radio buzzing] Fuck! [Radio clanking] You're gonna run out of time yet, Young. You're gonna die. Teddy doesn't care if you live or die. Right, and you do. Don't listen to him. Trust me. [Bob] I don't care what - that fucking idiot says. - Let me help you. - Don't fucking do it. - Both of you, shut the fuck up! God, shut up. Fuck. [door knocking] [Huber] Valerie? [door knocking] Valerie? Are you there? It's Huber. Huber, you've got an armed man out there. Watch your back. I'm shot. Both detainees are secure. [Huber] Suspect fled the scene. It's over. [electronic beeping] Passcode isn't working. Did you change it? Yeah. [Huber] Well, tell me what it is so I can get in there and help you. Where's Mitchell? [Huber] They're all dead, Valerie. [ominous music] I'm sorry. Son of a bitch murdered every last man. Where are you shot? Didn't you hear my call out earlier? No, I wasn't near my radio. [ominous music] Valerie! [Valerie] Huber. Why were you interested in those IAFIS scans? [Huber] What's that? Kimble said you asked about the IAFIS scans for our DUI. [Huber] You know, I... I just had a really bad feeling about that guy. Which guy? [Huber] Viddick. The DUI. He was processed as John Doe. Where'd you get the name Viddick? [ominous music] Where's the man who killed your fellow officers, Huber? Is he whispering in your ear? [Huber] He don't care about us. All we have to do is stand down and give him Murretto. We've already lost three cops. I can't even think about losing another one, okay? You're a piece of shit, Huber, and a horrible cop. I never liked you and Sarge couldn't stand you. [Huber chuckling] Well, you know what, Valerie? Sarge doesn't have to worry about me anymore and you're not gonna have to worry either, if you keep up this Alamo bullshit! You already got a bullet in your belly, hun. You want another one in your brain? I'd like you to try, motherfucker. I'd like you to get on in here and get that bullet there. You wanna do that for me? Oh yeah, we are. We're gonna come in there, you stupid fucking bitch! You hear me? We're getting in there!

[ominous music] [Huber] This is it. [Anthony] Can't we access it through these ducts? [Huber] It's 12 inches in diameter. It's way too narrow. [Anthony] How about we break down that door? [Huber] Nah. This thing's like the side of a fucking tank. It's an armory style door. Never get in. That's why I think, we bust in through this wall. Come in through the locker room. This is Murretto's cell, right here. I mean, it's a thick son of a bitch. Probably a foot of solid concrete. Well, let's bang some rock. What do you think they're doing out there? Finding a way in. When they do get in, they'll kill you first. I would tell you to barter with them, but Lamb will just lie, then strip the skin off your bones once you give him what he wants. All you had to do was just let me blow Murretto's head off when I had the chance. Then you wouldn't be sitting there with a bullet in your side, praying for a fucking miracle. Bullets before prayers. Is that a poem? Bullets before prayers. My great-grandfather had that scrawled on his Stahlhelm helmet in World War II. Stahlhelm? Isn't that a German army helmet? Your great-grandfather was a Nazi? But you're... Black? Black. Nazis were in North Africa in the 1940s. Just a little trivia to take from this circumstance. Like most Germans, at the time he had to fight, they were being overrun, he didn't have a choice. Yeah, deja vu. Wait, what? Deja vu. That's not deja vu, dummy. Yes it is. No, it's not. Deja vu is when you experience the exact same thing a second time. Or the sensation that you have. Why you taking his side? How the fuck am I taking his side? You said that your great-grandfather had a fight, that he was overrun and he had no choice. Like me, sitting right here. Deja vu. Okay, whatever. You win. Anybody else feel cold? Hey, look at me! Young, don't close your eyes. Throw me the keys. Throw me the keys. You're better off bleeding to death, sitting there. Do not give him the keys! You gonna listen to that contract killer or are you gonna listen to me? Are you fucking kidding? He's a mob flunky conman. Who would you rather have fighting for your life right now, Val? Not you. Never you. Why, because I'm the bad guy? [wall thudding] [sinister music] Shit. [concrete thudding] Here they come. [ominous tempo music] [hammer clanking] [Huber grunting] [Huber huffing] Hey, asshole! You gonna help me or you just gonna sit there eating that shit? We's got but the one hammer there, hoss. Yeah, I get that. But I thought that maybe we could switch, you know? Trade off. Oh, come on, man, I already killed four people tonight. Including two of your coworkers. I am bushed. I killed my fucking sergeant tonight. And an innocent civilian. Yeah, well. You in the cop business. So that makes you a murderer. But I'm in the murder business, so that just makes me a laborer. You see how that works? You're fucking crazy. And also, on top of it, not to beat a dead horse, but you could use some physical activity. Oh, motherfucker. Come on, man, I kinda mean your wife likes you sliding all up on top of her, looking like a big old Hot Pocket with a hard-on. I mean, look, don't you wanna look like that one time? Fucking Chris Hemsworth enjoys a beach day with his wife, Elsa Pataky. Just one time in your life, don't you wanna look like Thor? Of course you do. It's only gonna happen with hard work and a swinging of the mighty hammer. So carry on, my Norseman. Come on, Thor! [Hammer thudding] I think we're out of prayers, Young. [wall thudding] I don't want to see you bleed out and I don't want to see anybody take the skin off your bones. [wall thudding] I just wanna get the fuck out of here. Young, you wanna see your way through this? Don't listen to him. Throw me the fucking keys. [wall thudding] Think he's gonna make it through these guys, and if he does, you think you're gonna see him again? [wall thudding] [keys clinking] [ominous music] Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. All that blood loss has made you loopy, lady. [Valerie] I don't wanna die in here if I can help it. And I'm trusting you, Teddy. Do as you say and help me and not run from this. All Teddy does is run! He was running from me, he ran to you. How do you think he got in here? He sucker punched a cop, you! [ominous music] I got that last week. Fuck. I want it back. [Bob] Oh, you just fucked us both. In the kitchen, next to the intake lobby, there's a trauma kit above the fridge. [Bob] He's a fucking opportunist, that's all he is. Please bring that back here. I won't make it otherwise, Teddy. Ask Officer Young where your ex wife and son are, Teddy. [sinister music] You said you sent out a unit to check on them. Did that unit ever arrive, Officer Young? Are Teddy's family all wrapped away, safe and sound? Young, where are they? I'm sorry, Teddy. What? I'm sorry. [ominous music] Did you know my family was dead, Viddick? You couldn't have saved them anyway, Teddy. You doomed them a long time ago. [foreboding music] Did you kill my family, Bob? [Bob sighing] I didn't. Lamb have something to do it with it? [eerie music] [Bob] I can't be sure. Best guess. [Bob] Where were they found? In a runoff slew near Lake Mead. Yeah, it was him. [sinister music] [intense music] [gun clicking] [Ruby] On top of the car there was a butt naked tranny with a mask on. [Barnes laughing] Dude, you can't say tranny. You have to say transvestite. That's what you call them? Now you have to say transvestite. - It's just like... - Hey, fuck that. Hey, where the fuck is everybody? [hammer thudding] They still doing construction this late? They shouldn't be. [hammer thudding] [foreboding music] [eerie music] What the fuck is this? What the fuck happened here? [hammer thudding] [ominous music] - [hammer thudding] - Come on, man. [hammer thudding] This fucking thing's taking forever. Huber, what the fuck? Hey, guys. You're back. Where, why are you back? We ran out to a scene for Val. What the fuck are you doing? And who is this? Why is he... [gunshots popping] [Barnes screaming] No, no, no, wait, hold on. No, no, Huber. Huber, I don't know nothing, I didn't see nothing. Hey man, I got kids. He's not gonna say anything. Tell him you're not gonna say anything. I swear to fucking Christ, I'm not gonna say... Are you sure? You can trust him, he's my friend. Oh, you all friends. Yeah. - [Barnes groaning] - Then you shoot him. All friendly like. What? I can't, not Barnes. You shot your sergeant. This man means something to me. I'm gonna walk over there and empty the contents of this weapon - into his face. - No, oh God. So if you plan to be more humane, now is the fucking time! No, Huber, Huber, come on, man. He shot Ruby. [Gunshots popping] [Barnes yelping] [Huber] I'm sorry, Barnes. Look at me, dude. - Look at me. - You were right. - Look at me. - [Anthony yelling] You know my kids, man, I promised them I'd be home. [Huber] I know, just a second. Just close your eyes, all right? [Teddy screaming] [gunshots booming] [ominous music] [Bob] Please tell me your grand plan was not freeing that fucking idiot and putting a gun in his hand. What choice did I have? [Bob] Freeing and arming me. You're a hired killer. [Bob chuckling] I wish you knew what I knew about him. And you were so hellbent on saving the day that you wound up shooting yourself. I don't wanna live in a world where people like you win, Viddick. Right. You'll just safeguard a lying asshole and give your life to protect his. Should I live like you, Bob? It's honest. It's lawless. And I won't stand for it. No, you'll just sit there and bleed out instead. [dramatic music] Come on. Give me the keys. Give me the keys, Valerie. No. And don't call me Valerie, it's creepy. [cuffs clanking] [ominous music] What the fuck? How'd you do that, Bob? Let's put a pin in that right now, Val. I just wanted to see how our little friendship would play out. Now pretty soon you're gonna lose consciousness. You're gonna fall asleep and you're not gonna wake up. Then will you listen to my dying wish before I do? [somber music] You have someone you love. Don't we all? No, we don't but you do. No, that's your left hand, your gun hand. Not gonna wear a ring there. You're married. You wanna see him again? Teddy's not coming back, you can trust me on that. You said you wanted to take your chances. Here they are.

I was grabbing this kit, right here, and I was coming back. Oh, so you were gonna bring it after you ate, but before you lit this place on fire? And where's my gun? Am I gonna get that back? [ominous music] That's okay. I got my friend's gun. My dead friend. [eerie music] I heard that machine gun of yours making quite the statement. So, have you seen Huber? Lamb? Viddick? There it is. My own bullet that I put in my stomach protecting you. Viddick was right about you. But... we are what we are. Always. You seem to always have so much to say. Nothing new now? I'm just wondering where all this is going. Yeah. Me too. I guess we'll find out soon. I radioed in a code three, also known as a hot call, so, we're 10 minutes away from our parking lot being flooded with every available law enforcement officer within a 20 mile radius. [ominous music] And I just took an adrenaline shot. So I'm feeling a little rambunctious. Shame. [Valerie sighing] You could run. So you could shoot me in the back? You've already stabbed me in mind. [fire rumbling] I think we should get you back to your cell now, Teddy. [fire whooshing] [suspenseful tempo music] Unless you had something else in mind.
