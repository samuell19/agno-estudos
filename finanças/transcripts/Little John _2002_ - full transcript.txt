I'm John Morgan. You must be Mr. Morgan. Ma'am.I'm Sister Mary Margaret. Where is she? Come in and sit down,Mr. Morgan. She didn't see howshe could take careof a baby by herself. And she was afraidto see you. And the father--where's he? She told me she wouldn't haveanything to do with him. I told her... I told hernot to date that boy. What a mistake. Mistakes are what we're hereto redeem, Mr. Morgan. You know, someBuddhists believe that an unplanned babybrings the most happiness. Buddhists?I studiedcomparativereligions in college, and we do tendto agree with the general idea. She's supposed to go backto Austin in the fall. She'd be a seniorat the university. I guess that's where she went. I don't thinkshe's going back to Austin. Well, then I'd best getabout finding her. She doesn't wantyou to find her,Mr. Morgan. She signed the papersto put the baby upfor adoption and left. If you gave her some time... Adoption? Well... our businessis done, Sister. Thank you for calling. Your grandson, Mr. Morgan. Natalie has no ideaI called you. Mr. Morgan, if this baby'sadopted by strangers he could be lost to you... or your daughter forever. I was the best fatherI knew how to be. Don't need another chanceto be a failure. The Chinese symbolfor "crisis" is made up of twosymbols, Mr. Morgan. One is danger;the other is opportunity. JOHN:Don't put your footon the brake. I'll-I'll do that. Remember, just relax. Good. Breathe and relax. Ten o'clock and two o'clock. Good. Oh, yeah,you're driving now. Look at you.Look at you.( laugh) Look-- no hands. Look-it! L.J. Now, you keep your handson the wheel and you keep looking ahead,okay? Just like driving a bike. Now turn, slow down. JOHN:L.J. Aw, man, every summer. You rememberMiss Penfield's grandson? Hi, Benny. Benny want to be put to work. Think we could teach himhow to be a real cowboy? Uh... sure, yeah. Yeah. Heh. I'll leave him to you. Come on, Benny. Still is nothingto do out here. My grandpa always saysthere's lots to do if you got theinclination to do it. That's what my grandma says. So, uh, if you don't like itso much how come you keepcoming back out here? So I can get my vacation. My mom and dad saidthat unless I come here I have to go to summer school. They have to work all day,and no one's at home. See? It's a good thing,being here. And your mama alwayscomes to visit fora few days, right? Yeah. How come you don't livewith your mom? 'Cause I live here. So, why doesn'tshe ever visit? She just doesn't. But why? 'Cause she's dead. Here. Why don't youfeed that one. How'd she die? Well, it was, uh,it was when I was a baby. There was a flash flood. A big flash flood. Doesn't matter. Sorry.Yeah. Hey... tell you what,you help me finish feeding all the horses,and I'll take you riding tomorrowmorning.Great. L.J., make sureyou step him off. All right, Benny, he's ready. Come on, get on, I'll help you. I'll climb up after you. All right,I'll get him warmed up. Easy, Sparky. Sparky...! Old Sparky's getting readyto dust you boys off good. I been throwedby bigger horses than this. All right, you ready, Benny? I have to go backto my grandma's. They'll be lookingfor me to take a nap. My grandma alwaysmakes me take a nap. Benny, how are you evergoing to be a cowboy? Hey, it's mysummer vacation-- I don't haveto do anything. Except take a nap. Yeah? Well, my grandma saidyour mom never died in no flood. She said shejust ran off. ( sigh) Merle, there'sa section of fence down up by oldMiss Penfield's. MERLE:Just the wire,or the post, too? Both. Let's take the truck. ( sigh) Looks like that's itfor the night. Okay, John.I'll see you in the morning. Don't work too hard,little man. So, you told Bennyyour mother was dead. Why not? We don't know any different. (people applauding) And I want to congratulateNatalie Britain who, in spiteof the fact that she is one of the youngest judgesever appointed to this court has already had a distinguishedcareer as a child advocate. We know that her experience will only help to serve herand this court in a positive way. Welcome to the bench,all of you. Excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me. I'm sorry I'm late. One of those little boyswho's been a lawyerfor all of three weeks needed a crash coursein filing a petition. Sylvia, are you...? I'm all yours. (laughing):Oh... yay. You're my clerk-- are you sure? 20 years with Judge Connellymust be worth something. I know where all the bodiesare buried. You continue to amaze me. Andrenew my suspicionabout human nature. ( laugh) You look older as a judgethan you did as a lawyer. Must be the robe. Good. Hi. Hopefully, you'll never haveto use this in the courtroom but I think every judgeshould have one. Congratulations, Natalie. Thank you. Excuse me. I thought you two broke up. I just hope she offthat Mexican food kick. Only my sister would thinkshe could come back to Texas and improveon our favorite dishes. John Morgan,come over here and give yourlittle sister a kiss. How was your trip,Etta? Ooh, it was longand dusty. Oh, my preciouslittle John. I swear you just shot upsince last summer. Call me L.J.,Aunt Etta. Aren't you glad to see me? Yeah. Yay, ooh! Come on, let's getmy bags. Come on. I'll get this one, John. And you and L.J.get that one. Whoo, if don't get outof these shoes pretty soon I'll be too crippledto cook. I brought the roasted sesame oiland fermented fish sauce and Chinese black mushroomsall the way from Los Angeles. Now I hate to think whatwould happen to you two if I didn't come downhere every summer. Men turn into barbarianswithout a woman's touch. Etta, what are thoseblack things? Tree ears. Tree ears? Well, they're notreally ears. They're a kind of mushroom. Now tomorrow I'm going to make Pad Thainoodles and chicken larb and stir-fried tofu with black bean paste. Whatever happened to Mexican? Oh, now hush upand just try it. These vegetables are raw. Well, you don'twant to cook allthe nutrients out. Now clean your platesor I'm going to have to eat that strawberry shortcakeall by myself. John, you and I'lltake care of all this. L.J., you go and practice. No, I'll helpyou here. Go on. How's he doing? Oh, he's a good boy. (playing scales) ( plays off-key note) ( whimper) I knew it was herthe second I saw it even afterall these years. Her last name's Britain. She get married? You could ask her. Don't tell meL.J. isn't asking. He's old enough to wonderabout his mother. We don't really talk about her. Well, don't you thinkyou should? Hurts L.J., so I don'tbring it up. And he doesn't? That's what I thought. You'rethe one who doesn'twant to talk about it. You have to deal with Natalie. You're not gettingany younger, John. For crying out loud, Etta,what's that supposed to mean? I ain't going to die. Well, there's an accomplishment. And how am I supposedto talk to her? Not a word from hersince she left. You're her father;reach out to her. She made it clear to me she ain't want to beno part of this family. Well, she might nowif she knew you adopted the verychild she gave away. And L.J. might want to talkto her if he knew... Etta, please. Leave this to me. This clipping is a sign, John. An absolute sign. (John coughing) ETTA:Sit down, John. Now just relax. (coughing) (coughs) It's just allergies, L.J. Everything's okay,honey. Go on back to bed. ( John cough) Ma'am? Yes? Delivery.Are you Natalie Britain? Yes. I've got a package herefrom the clerk of the Family Courtof Los Angeles. You got to sign. Where do you want these? Right there is fine. Are you sure?I'll take them in. Nope, that's fine, thanks.I'll get them later.Pretty heavy. I'd be happy tobring them inside...No, thank you. Okay. Homework? I'm so glad to seeyou've been given enoughtime to get acclimated. Just a little light reading. Obviously. I was wondering if you'dlike to have coffeethis afternoon. Oh, no thanks, I've gota lot of work to do. So do the other four judgeswho come to my chambers for coffee on Wednesdays. We catch up on scheduling,things like that. You'd be just one ofthe guys, so to speak. 4:00. John, I don't want youto overwork yourself. But after you getall that furniture outside I want you to layall those cushionsout in the sun and let the airget into them. And then we need to washall this woodworkand the windows. And after that I want to tackle all thosecabinets in the kitchen. I have never seen such a mess. (sighs):I'll be in the atticif you need me. You really didn't have totake me out to eat, John. Not treat you after allyou've done for us? Why, we wouldn't hear of it. Now, would we, L.J.? Chicken-fried steak, cream gravy mashed potatoes green beansand bacon. Come on now,eat up, Etta. You won't get a chanceto eat like this when you go back to Los Angeles. I don't believe you, John. After all these years,how can you still eat like this? Now, I've stocked up thefreezer in the garage besides the containersin the refrigerator. You're out of eggs and I think that milkis a little blinky. You should've let mestop at the store. No, Etta, we don't wantyou to miss your bus. No, I don't thinkthe post office wants to let meretire just yet. And that poor Lou,I'm satisfied he's abouthalf-starved by now. You know that maneats like a bird. Hmm. Thank you, honey. Sure. Oh, excuse me.That's all right. John... Etta, don't start upon me again. Doctor say I'm just fine. You're getting worse, John. I don't think that medicineis helping you anymore. And the stuff you're eating... Please, Etta. You think he doesn't know? What if somethinghappens to you? Why don't you workthis out while you can? I love you, Etta but you sure can behard to get along with. Come over here, L.J.,and give me a hug. Come on, driver,you're going to make us late. L.J., we've gota freezer to clean out. Come on. ( grunt) L.J.:Bye! Looks like this horsemight founder. Yeah, too much grainand not enough work. But he's a good horse. How many we got left? Uh, five, Grandpa. Good job. Be right back. (whirring) It's okay. Just calm down. L.J., let him go. He's only going to hurt himself. We got to let him run till he'sready to come back on his own. I think it's time wetake a little vacation. A vacation? What about the ranch? Well, Merle can takecare of it for a while. Besides, I thinkit's time you see a littlemore of the world. Well, uh... where? I was thinking aboutgoing out west seeing the desert. That'd be great. As long as we're out there,we might as well go to Los Angelesand see your Aunt Etta. She was just here. ( sigh) Well, I mean, shouldn't we waittill Christmas or something? Your Aunt Etta... she gave me this clippingout of the newspaper. (horse neighing) That's your mother, L.J. And she live outin Los Angeles, too. She's a judge. See, says it right there. I always knewshe would be somebody. That's my mother? Yeah. L.J... you got to tryand understand. When your motherwent to college I had a real hard timeletting her go. I was pretty rough on her. So, maybe she ain't wantto see me after all these years,but... that don't meanshe don't wonder about you. Talk some more later. Let's finish up this work. Why didn't you know my father? Didn't you wantto meet him? Your mother was in college. She told meshe had been dating him. I wanted her to haveevery chance to be all she wanted to be. He was a distraction. That's all I knew,that's all I needed to know. Whatever happenedto him? I never heard. Did he knowabout me? I don't know, L.J. If he did he sure enoughmade a mistake missing outon you. So did she. I don't think I want to see her,Grandpa. She's your mother, L.J. Only one of thoseto a customer. She doesn't care. You don't know that. I liked it better when we could just sayshe was dead. Judge Britain. Judge Chandler. I'm having dinnerat Chez Lorraineat 7:00 on Friday. If you're not there,I'll get the hint and I'll sayno more about it. But I'm hopingyou'll be there. If for no other reasonthan to tell me what went wrongbetween us. If you're notgoing, I am. With all duerespect, Your Honor he seems kindof perfect to me. (piano playing mellow jazz) NATALIE:So the mother keepsgetting restraining orders against the fatherto keep him away from her but when he obeys itand stays away she accuses himof neglecting the children. That's an easy one. You give the kidsto the father. Why? Because the mother's crazy. (both chuckling) I wish it were that simple. I thought wewere doing so well or I never would havetold you how I felt. I thought it was mutual. Was I wrong? Now, there'sthat look again. Maybe it was just too fast. Not that fast. No, not that fast. Natalie,what is it? I thought we were readyto go to the next level. I was just, um... Unsettled? Uninterested?Unimpressed? No. Not unimpressed. You know that. I'm just not ready. I'm sorry. But you met me here. Yes, I did. So the jury is still out. JOHN:You ain't hungry? Look, here, L.J. I want to seeher myself... but you don't have to. You and me, we'll betogether like always. ( lively jazz playin) Now, you see that, L.J.? They started with the melody. They laid that down. Then they start to improvise. Yeah, they let their heartstake over. Now, they're all separate but they'retogether. You hear that? Too many notes for you, huh? I'm sorry. I can't help it. Well, you got a loton your mind. Go ahead, you turnto whatever stationyou want to listen to. There's nothing like musicto cheer a man up. That is,ifhe wants to be cheered up. Huh, you want tobe cheered up, boy? Huh? Huh? Huh? ( laughin) ( coughin) (hacking coughs) I got it, Grandpa.(gagging coughs) ( whisperin):Grandpa... ( groanin) Grandpa, take it. (gagging) Hold on, Grandpa, okay? (coughing) Can somebody help me? My grandpa's havingan attack. We have to get himto the hospital. I'll help you, son. Come on, he's this way. ( coughin) Let's see if we can't make ita little easier for you to breathe, sir. (gasping) Okay, son, I need youto sit here and keep your grandpapropped up like this. Don't let him slumpor fall over. Okay. Can you hold him like thatwhile we drive? Yeah.Good. Now, just relax, sir. We're getting youto the hospitalright now. Don't worry, Grandpa. We got some help. I'm really gladyou were there. Yeah, I'm glad Icould be of help. You can go seeyour grandfather now. Thank you. Hey, Grandpa. Hey, L.J. How you doing? They have to adjustmy medication but I think we canget back on theroad tomorrow. Sir, I guessthe Good Lord was with us. Finding a doctor in the middle ofnowhere like that. Even though hea veterinarian. Hope you're nottoo disappointed. It's pretty slim pickingsout there. Aunt Etta will say I got justwhat I deserved,won't she, L.J.? Yep. Must be a millionbuildings down there. Sure seems like youcould get yourself lost in all that. Maybe we oughtto get home. If we don't talk to her someday we mightregret it. Ooh, you made it. I've been sittingby that window ever since you called. Hey,Uncle Lou. Hey, L.J. And I hope youhaven't eaten 'cause I got supperin the oven. After dinner, I gotsomething out back that I think mightinterest you. So, uh, what do you dowith all these? When you getto be my age it's nice tofind a hobby. You like bicycles? Sure. Yeah. I find themdown at the dump or at yard sales,anywhere I can think of. I give them a littlelove and tenderness. Oil 'em, polish 'em-- fix their broken spokes-- occasionally mend a chain,and poof... just like magic, theycome back to life. Restored andgood as new. You fixingthis one up? Well, I get throughabout one a month give or take. That's pretty good considering some of themdon't even have tires. And you know whatthe best part is? It's the lookon some child's face when he getsone of these bicycles for the first time. Do you sell them? I donate them. These are strictlyfor charity. Why don't you take this oneto ride while you're in town? Thanks, Uncle Lou. Long as you stayon the side streets and wear this helmet. Your grandmother made methis quilt when Lou and I got married. The pattern'scalled "Wedding Ring." How long ago was that? Oh, long beforeyou were born. It was a yearbefore your grandmother died. Was she nice? She wasthe sweetest woman. And smart. She used to sit on the porchin the evenings and recite poetry. She didn't believein lullabies. She put her baby to sleepwithGunga Din andThe Cremation of Sam McGee and I don't knowwhat all. That was your mothershe was tucking in. Nighty-night. Nighty-night. (trumpet playing mellow jazz) (glass breaking) ETTA:John...! I love you, Grandpa. They'll look after him. He has gooddoctors, L.J. L.J., here's some more toast. And here's mypager number ifyou need anything. Now, make yourselfat home here and Lou and I bothwill be back about 5:00 and then we'll go tothe hospital, okay?

Excuse me. Do you know wherethe courtrooms are? Through there andup the escalator. Thank you.You're welcome. You can go ahead. WILLIAMS:Children's Serviceswas notified of the possible problem when the doctor foundthe bruises last month. We've talkedto Mr. and Mrs. Brumer and they say they have no ideawhere Lisa got the injuries. NATALIE:And what doesthe foster child say? Lisa won't talkabout what happened to her. Mr. and Mrs. Brumer the bailiff will show youout of the courtroom so that we can speakwith Lisa. Let's bring Lisa in,Mr. Williams. Yes, ma'am. Don't be scared, Lisa. I'm not going to letanything hurt you, okay? Did you get hurtby falling down? Did you have an accident? Lisa, look up. Look up and lookaround the room. Do you see the personwho hurt you in here? No, that personis not here. So, it's okay. You see my black robeand this big desk? They show that I can order anybodynot to hurt you again, ever. So, I hope you'll trust me because I want to protect you. Can you answer Mr. Williams' question? Okay. Mr. Williams, please repeatthe question for Lisa. Lisa, can you pleasetell us what happened when you were livingwith Mr. and Mrs. Brumer? He hurt me. I wake up at night and I think he's goingto come and take me. I promise, whoever hurt youwill never come near you again. So, just tell usabout how you got those bruises. Nothing bad is goingto happen to you. LISA:Mrs. Brumer... she makes fish sticks,and I don't like them. So I pushed themunder my plate. He hit me. WILLIAMS:Who did? Mr. Brumer. He hit me on the ear and then on the sideand said "You eat that. Eat that." And I started crying and he hit me again'cause I was crying. (sniffling) Okay. It's okay. Just take a little rest. Take all the timeyou need. We'll call you backif we need you. Let's proceed, Mr. Williams. With all due respect,Your Honor Children Servicesdoes the best it can. Oh, really? Is this what happens whensomebody's minding the store? This man committeda crime, Mr. Williams. Who is paying attention to Lisa? The foster parentsare supposed to. Mr. Brumer has madea permanent impression on Lisa of what foster fathers can do. Who is this caseworker? Well, uh... there have been several. NATALIE:By my count, eight in the last five years. This child has beenin foster care most of her life and she's never known a homeshe can call her own. I warn you Mr. Williams, I'm about to losemy judicial temperament. Your Honor, if I may begthe Court's indulgence? I'll indulge you. I'll give you one week to get this childinto a good home. There are good familiesproviding foster care. Unfortunately,a lot of these foster families do it because they get paid. Most of them do it because they care about kids. They're not in it for the money. Get this kid a break,Mr. Williams and notify the D.A.about Mr. Brumer. We will adjourn for lunchand resume at 1:00. ( pounds gave) Are you here with anybody? N-No, I just... I wanted to meet the judge. Meet the judge? No can do. Can I just watch? These peopleare going through bad times and they have the rightto their privacy. You can't come in here unless you havebusiness beforethe court. What does that mean? Well, that meansif you have a problem then you need to get a lawyer,and then you can come back. WOMAN (over P.A.):...7102, please. ( phone ring) Etta Green. Mrs. Green, I'm calling from CCUat Hope Memorial. Dr. Johann feels we may needto put in a pacemaker. Why? What happened? Mr. Morgan's stableat the moment but he has been havinga difficult time. The doctor just feelsit would be good if you could get here to see himas soon as possible. I get off at 5:00. All I have to do ispick up my nephew and we'll be right there. That'd be fine. I'll see you then. Okay. NATALIE:You mean,after all of this Mr. and Mrs. Davidsoncannot agree on custody? She's turning my own children against me. They don't wantto see me they cry when I goto pick them up and I have to have themmore often. NATALIE:Sit down, Mr. Davidson. Sit down, both of you. The original custody agreementstates that you see your childrentwo times a week. Mr. Davidson, I suggest you make the most of the timeyou've been allotted. Next case. Henry Jacobson. Either you have avery small fan club or an evensmaller stalker. The little guyin the back. Find out whathe's doing here. The attorneysapproach the bench. Hi. Hi. Are you with anybody? No. Where are your parents? It's okay.I just want to help you. I need to see the judge. Oh. Well, the judge doesn't seeanybody just like that. But I need to see her. See, my grandpa,he's in the hospital. He might die. I just need to see the judge. And you're here aloneat a time like this? Why? He raised me. He's all I've got. And I need to talk to her. Please. The court has a social worker. I'll have him come over. I need to talkto her. Please. I'll talk to the judge. No promises. He's sincere enough. He seems like a sweet kid. But I can'ttell you why he wants totalk toyou. Tell him I'll see himat the end of the day. Hi. I'm Judge Britain. What's your name? Uh, they call meLittle John-- L.J. L.J. Are you all right? Look, I don't knowif that other lady told you but I was hoping you'd come to the hospitalwith me to see my grandfather. I can't do that, L.J.,but Icanget a social worker to go with you or... No, please.It has to be you. Me? It's really important, ma'am. He may be dying. I just don't knowwhat you think I can do. Please? If you won't let me call a social worker or a lawyer I'm sorry, I... There's really nothingmore I can do. You have to help me. But I can't go with you.I'm sorry. Truly, I'm sorry. He knew your mother. Well, that's unlikely. My mother's been deadsince I was five. She didn't sing you lullabies. She recited poetry. The Cremation of Sam... Sam somebody. McGee. He's down there. Where are your parents?Why aren't they here? They're gone. You're what, 13? Twelve. So who looksafter you? He does. Well, there must besomeone else. We're here visitingmy aunt and uncle. They live here in L.A. Well, who doyou live with? My grandpa. He's all I've got. L.J., there you are. I've been outof my mind... Oh, my. Natalie. Aunt Etta. Your father adopted him. (monitor beeping) I need you to stepoutside the room. We'll just bea few moments. You can waitright over there. Okay. Any word? Mm-mm. Thanks. Mr. Morgan's family? Yes. They're getting himsettled again. You'll be able to see himin the morning. How is he? He'll be able to go homejust as soon as we make sure that the pacemaker we gave himis working properly. He'll be almostas good as new. Thank heaven. Why don't you go homeand get some rest? You look likeyou could use it. I made a mistakebringing her here. It's not your fault.He just had a setback. Son, he hada heart problem. But don't worry, we fixed it. Go get some rest. (trumpet playing upbeat tune) (trumpet continues) Thanks. Aha. I found you. Hi. You okay? You want totalk about it? For a judge, I'ma good listener. No, thanks. You want to leave? I don't think we should. We don't have to gotogether, if that's it. No, it's not that.It just wouldn't begood politics. Half the judgesin the county are here. I don't thinkit's good politics for us to be standingaround on the sideswhispering, either. ( sigh):Steven... it's just somethingI have to deal with by myself. This is where I came in. Or... went out,to be precise. Natalie, there's apart of you I havenever even met. Well, I just don't think we haveto talk about everything. ( sigh) Listen, I love you... but I'm not goingto keep on pushing. When you get yourselftogether, let me know. Whoa. Those for me? I heard you playinglast night. Really. Sorry if Idisturbed anybody. No. I mean, I liked it. Thanks. So, uh...what were you playing? 'Cause that wasn't a tune,was it? Well, actually it was. But I was just playingthe changes. You play? Not me. I take lessons. You like jazz? Not especially. My grandpa does. What kind? What kind? Yeah, well, there'sdifferent kinds. There's bebop, there's fusion there's New Orleans. Not to mention... What does he listen to?What players? Everybody, it seems like. Good for him. So, uh, where do you play? Different places. You going to play now? Well, actually I'm goingto rehearsal right now. ETTA:L.J... time to go. Put your bike away. That you? L.J.? Yeah. What's up, L.J.? I'm Nelson. Nice to meet you. L.J.:They put the pacemakerin your arm? Just a little cutunder my collarbone. Guy must have usedthe dullest knifehe could find, though. (chuckles weakly) L.J., I want to talk to youabout what happened. I'm sorry, Grandpa. I just thought... I thought seeing her would...would help you. A real smart womanonce told me... in Chinese... the symbol for crisisis made up of two symbols. One is danger; the other... opportunity. I've been thinking about how short life is. I'll be out of here in a day or two. I want you to take meto see her. Grandpa... I wish we couldjust go home. Mmm-mm. Not yet, L.J. We ain't finished here. NATALIE:I see nothingin this report which indicatesthat Mr. Wallace made any attemptto see his children, Mr. Bates. BATES:Well, Your Honor,he has wanted to but the motherwouldn't allow it. NATALIE:Is that true, Counselor? WOMAN:Only becausethe father hasn't made any child support paymentsin two years. Your Honor, respectfully... Why didn't she contactthe district attorney's office about collectinghis back child support? Takes time. And meanwhile,he's holding down a job and supporting the next familythat he started. My client thinksthat he should have thought abouthis first children before he startedfathering more. BATES:So she's judge,jury and executioner on this one, is she? She's entitled to heropinion, Your Honor but this punishesthe children as much as it doesthe father. People are scared of her. Well, I ain't raised herto be no pushover. None of the women inthis family ever were. This court agreesthat Mr. Wallace did not renouncehis financial responsibilities to his children afterhe and their mother divorced. So now that there'senough guilt to go around let's just settle thisonce and for all, shall we? Are you Mr. Morgan? Yes, ma'am. The judge has asked meto talk to you. She... told meto ask you to leave. L.J.:No, ma'am, please,we can't do that. He came all the way down herejust to see her. He's sick. I'm sorry. She wants you to leave. I'm sorry. I don't know why youwant to see her again. We were better offwithout her. Natalie. What do youwant from me? I just want to talk,Natalie. I don't see that we haveanything to talk about. I think you knowexactly what or whowe have to talk about. Don't you want to seeyour own son? Talk to him? Why are you usinghim like this? Natalie, familiesforgive each other. That's richcoming from you. I'm glad thatyou're doing well. I-I didn't askto be found. This is your grandfather's doing putting you in the middlelike this. I'm sorry. At one time, there wasno one kinder or gentler. She isn't now. She must have had anawful hard time, L.J. I'm sorry. I'm glad it's over. She never thought about us. (man shouts) Yo. Rich. Hey.Hi. Fancy meeting you here. Can we talk? Yeah. So, in the summerof my junior year I went to a homefor unwed mothers... and had the baby. I put him up for adoption,and then I came out here. You could havetold me this before. I wanted to put itall behind me, forgetit ever happened. But when I did putit all behind me I did more than just leave. I cut off my relationshipwith my father. And then he diedbefore you made up. That must have made itmuch worse for you. He didn't die;he's still alive. I'm sorry, Steven. It was just easier for me to liethan tell you the truth. That's a fairly substantial lie.I'm sorry. I just didn't think thatanybody would have to find out. Well... I can't run from it now. My father's here. With the child. What? My father adopted him. I never knew. You know,today I talked to my dad for the first time in years,and all I could do was say the meanest thingI could think of and run. I thought I was more maturethan to be that cruel. You didn't ask to be putin that situation. No, I didn't, but it doesn'tmake me feel any better. You know, I was so young and soscared and in so much trouble and he made itreal clear how much I had let him down. I'm sorry thatyou were so hurt. So now what do you want to do? I don't know what to do. I know it's a shock, Natalie but think what it must meanto your son to find his mother. JOHN:I'm a little bit nervous. L.J.:Me, too. It's going to beall right. Uh... look, I thinkI want to stay right here. Go ahead. Thanks. I'm glad you called, Natalie. He's a fine boy. Why did you bring himout here? I thought you'dwant to see him. Nobody asked you to interfere. The nuns gave me a chance to keep him from beinglost in the world so I took it. Maybe you should haveminded your own business. N-Natalie, I was only tryingto do right by him. I don't understand you. No, you don't. But now that the damage is done,I want to talk to him and I want youto go back to Texas. Well, L.J.,she wants to talk to you. I don't have anythingto say to her. Give it a try. Please. For me. Hi. Want to go for a walk? So, what grade are you in? Did you ever look for me? No, I never did. Why not? Because... you werea part of my past that I wanted to forget. But you were hard to forget. I was never really ableto do that. Yeah?Yeah. You were a sweet baby. Beautiful baby. I just couldn't keep you. Why not? 'Cause I couldn'ttake care of you. I don't care. Tell me about the ranch.You like it there? I don't know why you everleft it for all this. I always wanted to leave. I used to dream aboutbig cities and skyscrapers. So I guess I'm morelike my father, huh? Whatever happened to him? Did he know about me? No. It was very complicated. Do you know where he is? I have no idea. Tell me about yourself. Tell me what you like. What's your favorite book,your favorite movie? You're just asking to be nice. You don't have to. I don't need you. I have Grandpa. He's better. For me. Hey, little man. L.J., right? What's up, L.J.? We're going to be leavingin a day or two. Where you going? Home to Texas. Have a safe trip. Hey! You going to be playing anywherewhere my grandpa could come listen to youbefore we go? I'm playing the Minor Variations but that's not tillThursday night, but, hey if you want a souvenir,come on over and I'll give yousome flyers. All right. Something you couldput on your wall. Hey, thanks. ( playing jaz) You practice five hours a day for the next30 years and you probablycan do that, too. I don't think so. No, not really. I mean, jazz to mejust sounds like too many notes. Listen, you get a bunchof players all in a group and it all comes together, man. Everyone is doing theirown thing, all at the same time. You're yourself,but you're part of something bigger thanyou could ever be alone. You just feel it. So what's a guy do for fun in Texas? Well, uh, we havea ranch, horses. My grandpa's a farrier. That's cool. What else? Oh, uh, well, there is a... You know who really loves musicians, L.J.? Who? Girls. (laughs) Well, I guessthat's it, Etta. Better hit the road. I'd like to make Kingmanby tonight. Take this, L.J. I came this far. I did all I could. Come on, L.J.Time to go. Come on, now, giveyour big brother a hug. I can't leave youhere like that. It's all right. There'll beother chances and maybe aftershe's had time to think about ita little more it'll all work out. Maybe, Etta. Maybe. Take care of yourgrandpa, L.J. Don't forgetthe lunch Etta packed. Thank you, Lou. Love you,Uncle Lou. Love you, too. Give me a hug, L.J. You be good. Natalie. How did it go? Fine. Really? No. I talked to my son. He doesn't carea thing about me. I don't know why thatsurprised me so much. I got a dose of my own. I guess this is how he's feltall these years. You really can'tblame him. I don't. I understandhow he feels. I always talked to my dad. I loved him so muchwhen I was little. Can't tell youhow much I adored him. Then everything changed and now I can't talk to himat all about anything. Why not? Because I'm stillmad at him. After all these years,I'm still mad that he wasn't there for me. Well, I'm sure he didthe best he could. But I needed him. I needed help, and hedidn't give me any. So I did whatI thought was right. Now I'm afraid I got it wrong. Natalie you found yourselfin desperate trouble and you did a desperate thing. Makes me wonder, though. Who am I to decidewhere children belong when I couldn't figure it outfor my own child. It's a lotdifferent when you can be objective. Maybe I'm not objective. I'm goodat advocacy. I like to be on one sideor the other but to judge... What kind of judge would you be if youhadn't made mistakes? I have seenyou in action in my courtroom, and you'regood at what you do. Thanks, Steven. What do you supposethisis? I'd say it's cheese and this one, well, Idon't knowwhatthis is. Something groundup, I guess. You know, I saw a burgerplace back up the road. She's my only child, L.J. I love her. I gave her reasonsto act the way she do. You couldn't have doneanything that bad. Well, now, I wasdifferent then. You-- you're mysecond chance. Having you changed me. I guess I'dforgotten how much. And maybe I wasn't as gooda father as I wanted to be but I'd like to try andmake it up to her if I can. I think we'll just make itback to your Aunt Etta's before dark, L.J. L.J.:I don't have to go in there. I already talked to her. Come on, L.J. I can't leave youout here alone now. I wish I could juststay in the truck. Sylvia, would youpass me the file on case #01-75, please? Thank you. Natalie. Remember when youwere in grade school? You'd sit on a bale of hay and do your homeworkwhile I shoed horses. All them late nightsand early mornings. Never a day off. I wanted better for you. I wantedyou to have something like this. (sighs) I had a close call. I nearly died. This isn't the time or place. I may not get another chance. I'm asking you. Don't throw me outof your life again. Please. Sylvia, would youtake this young man and get him something to drink? It's been 13 years. Was I that wrong? I'm Sylvia. What's your name? L.J. Little John--L.J. for short. So how doesthe judge know you? Well, uh, she doesn'tknowme,but... She's his daughter. That makes heryour mother. There's a jailin the old part. You want to see it? Come on.I'll give you a tour. I was scaredand in trouble and I cameto you for help and all you did was tell mewhat a disappointment I was. How ashamed you were. All you cared about was howmy being pregnant affected you. Didn't you ever think about me? You were the only thingI cared about. I always loved you. Why couldn't yousay that back then? I neededto hear that then. I ain't know what to do. You could have been kind,loving, supportive. Natalie, I just neededsome time to get there. I would have helped you. Strangers were kinder to methan you were. Why can't you understandhow I felt? Don't you thinkI was upset? Do you have any ideawhat I was going through? I can't believe thatyou're making this about you. You don't thinkI was affected by this? I put everythingI had into your future and you were callousand irresponsible. You don't know the first thingabout what I was. I struggled to put you throughcollege when your mama died... Don't you use Mamaas an excuse for your behavior. I have every right to be angry. I deserved more from you. How dare you, Daddy? I was raped. You never told me. After what you'd saidabout me being pregnant? Hmm-mm. I'd been hurtand humiliated enough. What happened? It was James,wasn't it? I warned you about him. It wasn't James. It was Charlie. James' roommate. Hey, Natalie,you need a hand? No, thanks, Charlie. I thought you went home. Oh, I got boredlistening to James type. Oh. Charlie, whatare you doing? (shouting) Shh-shh-shh. I didn't make a sound. If you'd just told me... You'd have blamed me. No. No? You wouldn'thave asked questions like what was I wearingthat provoked him? Or why was I friendswith someone like that? Or what had I said or doneto make him do it? Don't talk like this, Natalie. It was a crime.He was a criminal. I should have known that. Why didn't I know that? I'm sorry. You know,it's been years since I've been ableto sleep through the night. I don't know if I'm everreally going to be able to feel safe again, Daddy. But that's whyI wanted someoneto take him. Because I was scaredthat every time I looked at him I'd be remindedabout that night and I'd hate him for it. But if I'd known that my ownfather was going to adopt him I would have taken him someplacewhere you'd never find him. Natalie, he's such a fine boy. If you only knew him. He's with me every day. I've worried about him. I've wanted to see him. And I'd be afraidthat he'd show up. What if people find outwhat I did? Yeah. Every dayI sit here and I make choicesfor children who are abandoned. I see how they suffer. And I wanted to protect him. We have to tell him. Tell him? Yes. Why would you wantto burden him with this? He has to know whyhis mother never wanted him. This is what happenswhen you interfere. If you'd have left this alone he could have gone through hiswhole life without ever knowing. Natalie, I've been the boy'sfather and mother all his life. I can't keep somethinglike this secret from him. Then you tell him. And you leave me out of it. Remember Lisa? The little girlwho was so scared. Took everythingshe had... but she survived. She even testified. And now she hasa new home. She's going to be fine. I guess we'll leavefirst thing tomorrow. (horn honks) Talk to you later, little man. There is one thing I'd like to dobefore we go. (up-tempo jazz playing) ( trumpet sol) Thank you forthat gift, L.J. That wasreally good, huh? He played... I'd like to speakwith him alone. We'll be insideif you want us. Why? What's going on? Let your mothertell you. A lot of decisionshave been made about you, L.J. Now you have somedecisions to make. I'm not leavingmy grandpa if that's what you mean. No, nothing like that. I know how you feel about me and I understand. Now, I hopethat you can understand. Understand what? Why I left you. I don't care. Do you know what rape is? I'm sorry. I'd give anythingto change it. I put you up for adoption because I didn't want youto ever know that your father raped me. Am I going to be like him? Like my father? No, never. You're nothing like him. I've seen youwith your grandfather and I know whatyou've been through to give him what he wanted... to see me. I knowyou didn't want to at all. You were there for himwhen he needed you and I'm proud of you. You are braveand you're strong and you're kind. (sniffling) And you'll grow into a fine man. Just likeyour grandpa. Thank you. Thank you for comingto tell me. (sighs) Well, I guess I didenough damage here. So you'releaving again? I'm sure that's whatthey both want. Maybe everybody just needsa little time. JOHN:I bet Merle will be gladto see us return home. He never did likemucking them stalls. L.J., what your mother told youabout your father... ...that's about who he was. That ain't about who you are. I'll be okay, Grandpa. You stillthe fine young man you always were. L.J.:See you later. GIRL:Bye. L.J.:Bye, everybody. Hey, how was school, L.J.? Okay. I tried outfor the band. That's wonderful news. Look, Grandpa,they'll take anybody. It's your mother, L.J. Captioning sponsored byARTISAN ENTERTAINMENT
