You'll be late for school. Oh, my God. [SIGHING] Good morning, Mom. Good morning, honey. Good morning, sweetheart. Uh, you know... Oh, you are so bad. Are you gonna spank me? Just don't start anything, you won't get any breakfast. Is that a threat or a promise? [GROANING] Shit, shit, shit. Uh-oh. We will continue this later. So, Mom, how's the arthritis today? Like you give a shit. [SQUAWKS] Earthquake!Sorry. [CLATTERING] Shit! Stanley.Mmm-hmm? I've been thinking.Mmm-hmm. Virgil needs a girlfriend. Hmm. I mean, he really needs a girlfriend. What brought this on? Well, you know, he's a teenage boy doing what most teenage boys do when they don't have a girlfriend. You don't want him to go blind, do you? [SIGHS] Stanley. Yeah. You know, our real concern should be if he's... If he's what? Oh, if he's, you know, normal. What are you talking about? Well, look at him. He's 17 years old. He's never been out with a girl. Doesn't that tell you anything? What's it supposed to tell me? That he's a fag. [GASPS] How can you say that? Virgil's just a little slow when it comes to girls. [SIGHS] It just started doing this. And Virgil is not gay. He's just a little immature. VIRGIL: Hey! Who turned off the water? Uh... Back on in a minute. You know, he does have your bottom. Stanley. Talk to Virgil. Encourage him to start dating. You're his father. Talk to him man to man. I've had enough of you two. [SIGHS] I'm gonna take a dump. Tomorrow, we call the nursing home. [EXHALES] Dwayne, you forgot your lunch! And here's your breakfast. Thanks, Ma. Okay, what's wrong? Nothing's wrong. I'm just not very hungry. [GASPS] Get back in the house. I'm calling the doctor! Mom, I'm not sick. I... I'm just a little nervous. About what? You know. That thing we talked about last night? Oh, you mean about asking Margaret Lapinski to the prom. Oh, don't be nervous, there's nothing to be nervous about. Oh, just ask her. It'll be good for you. Going out with a girl. [CHUCKLES] Maybe you won't spend so much time in the bathroom with those dirty magazines. Ma! What? You don't think I know what you do in there? Ma! It's normal, for a teenage boy. Now, your father, what's his excuse? I'm gonna be late for school. Well, have a nice day, sweetheart. Morning, dear. [CEREAL SPILLING] [GLASS SHATTERS] So, Virge, Mom tells me there's a senior prom coming up at your school soon. Uh, yeah. All right. Well, do you have a date yet? You know, Dwayne and I were just talking about that. Really? And what did you guys decide? Dwayne's gonna ask Margaret Lapinski. And who are you asking, dear? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. Well, hang in there, Son. If Dwayne can get a date, anybody can. [LAUGHING] Thanks. MARGARET: Dwayne, wait up. Hi, Margaret. Hi. You on your way to school? Yeah, unfortunately. You, too? Yeah. What kind of sandwich is that? Uh... It's a salad. Egg. Oh! It looks good. Well, you want a bite? Oh, thanks! [TIRES SCREECHING] That was good. You want the rest? Oh, thanks. Gee, it's hard to imagine that the senior prom is only a couple of weeks off. Yeah. I suppose you've already asked somebody. No, not really. I mean, there was this one time and I was... And then another time when I was thinking... But then the other day I was thinking about and... Yes!Huh? Yes, I'll go with you! Really? That's great. [STAMMERS] I mean, that's great! We'll make such a cute couple! Right. Fat and fatter! What did you say? Nothing.You called me fat! No, just pleasantly plump. Oh! You shitheel! You think I'm fat? Try looking in the mirror, blubber butt! Does that mean we're not gonna go to the prom together? Of course I'm gonna go with you. You can't get out of it that easy. She is a rough girl. I like it. You know, Son, when a boy gets to be your age, there's... Well, there's, like, these urges, I guess you'd call them. Being a healthy young male, these... Well, these urges, they need to be addressed. Oh, God! Please don't go there. I know, sometimes being a teenager... Heck! I was a teenager myself once. Sometimes the hormones get going so fast, you don't know if it's a girl or a boy that you want. I mean, it's normal. It doesn't mean that you have to be gay or anything. I mean, it doesn't mean that you're gay or anything like that. You know what I mean? No. I mean, you should just go for the girls. Yeah, girls are the way to go. Dad, I don't want girls. Yes, you do. Believe me, I know what's best for you. No, I don't want any girl. Try it first. I know what I'm talking about. No, Dad, there's this one girl that I want. Now, look, it's just... What did you say? There's just one girl that I wanna ask to the prom or anywhere else for that matter. It's Kellie Guthrie and she is the most beautiful, most wonderful... Well, yeah, that's great, Son. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS IN RELIEF] Yeah, that's great. Put on your seat belt. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] Yo, Virge, check this out. Hey, Amy, baby, how's it going? So, when are we gonna hang? Later, huh? Okay, you keep walking. I'll meet you there. Okay, Virge, tell me the truth. Do I got a shot at getting lucky with Margaret? I think that all depends on how you define lucky. Well, shit, man, I just know it's gonna happen. I mean, it's the law of averages. How many times can I strike out? You really want me to answer that? Okay, you see this baby? I've been saving it for two years and every day it says to me, [FRENCH ACCENT] "Tonight, is it going to be tonight?" [NORMAL ACCENT] Well, on prom night I get to say, "Yes!" Your condom talks to you? No, asshole, I mean it... Well... [FRENCH ACCENT] Forget it. He no understand, Pierre. How do you know it's still any good? [NORMAL ACCENT] Why shouldn't it be? Look, I know it's a couple years old and a little sticky, but it's still good. Oh, yeah. I swear, Dwayne, you have got to be the biggest dumbshit I have ever known. Oh, yeah? Well, okay Mr. Big Shot, so who're you gonna ask to the prom, huh? Kellie.Kellie Guthrie? Yeah. Why not? Well, one reason may be that Scott, her boyfriend, will rip off your head and use it as a bowling ball. Oh, no, no, no. See, you haven't heard. They broke up, my friend. They broke up. The field is wide open. Yeah, well, still, how the hell are you gonna ask her, smartass? You can't even think about Kellie without getting a hard on. I got that taken care of, too.

Of course, you know what that means. You flunk US History. So, class, can you think of anything worse than cheating? Your boyfriend farting on your first date?[STUDENTS LAUGHING] Your girlfriend telling you she's pregnant? Having your mom walk in on you while you're... Enough. I get the point. Now, as for you, young lady... Excuse me, Mr. Klausman? Virgil. Those are my notes. What?What? Those are my study notes. I like to go over them before a test, you know. But they must have fallen out of my pocket when I went for my inhaler 'cause I have this asthma... What are you babbling about, Mr. Heitmeyer? Well, I'm sorry if I caused any trouble, sir, but those are my notes. You, sir, are a liar. Mr. Klausman, I may just be a kid, you know. Immature in many ways and, you know, not yet sophisticated in the ways of the world per se... Do you have a point, Mr. Heitmeyer? Yes, sir. I do not lie. My integrity's never been brought into question and frankly, I kind of resent the accusation. Now, those are my notes. Not that I needed them. I mean, this test is really easy. You know, it's kind of a joke. I mean, number six, "Who was the general in charge of the Confederate Army?" What kind of idiot doesn't know that that was Robert E. Lee? And number 10, "Which Union general captured Atlanta?" [SCOFFS] Sherman. Could it get any easier? Look at this. "When did the Civil War end?" April, 1865. "Where is Fort Sumter located?" Charleston, South Carolina. Hello? [SCOFFS] "What was the name of the North's ironclad warship?" The Monitor. And you know what, if you don't know that Ulysses S. Grant was the head of the Union Army, you really shouldn't be in this class to begin with. [BELL RINGING] Have a nice day. Oh, way to go, bro. Old man Klausman didn't know whether to shit or go blind. I don't know what came over me. You know, I was just like, I didn't like the way he was talking to Kellie and so I just, you know... Ah, man, you saved my ass. Look, I'll probably pass that test now. Mmm-hmm. Virgil. Hi.Hi. I just wanted to thank you for what you did. It was really brave of you. It wasn't anything. Oh, believe me, it was. If I would've flunked that test, I probably wouldn't have graduated. I don't know what I can do to thank you. Well, you could go to the prom with me and after that we could have sex. Kellie, Kellie, we have some fabulous news. Fabulous. Okay, give me a minute, Debbie, I'm talking to Virgil. Just kind of don't announce it. Thanks again, Virgil. We'll talk later. You really saved my butt. Jesus, Scott, you see that? She just kissed the little jerk. Of course, I saw it. I'm not blind, for Christ sake. Oh! Oh, man. That was better than a wet dream. [EXHALES] You better watch out, stud. She might be going for the brainy type. Go fuck yourself. Hey, how's it going? Good. How are you? Hey! Oh, okay. If you even look at Kellie again, I'm gonna tear your arms off and shove them up your ass. Is there a problem here? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Hooperman. Virgil here just spilled his milk and I was helping him dry off. That was real nice of you, Scott. There you go, little buddy. You gotta be more careful next time. I don't understand you, Kellie. I thought you'd be thrilled to death that Scott wants you back. Well, you thought wrong. But you guys make such a cute couple. You know, Kellie, there's not a girl in the school that wouldn't die to trade places with you. Well, that works, because there isn't a girl in the school that Scott wouldn't screw if he had the chance. Is that what happened at Gina's party? Oh, hmm, you think? You know, I think you're being really narrow-minded. Hi, Kell. Can I talk to you a minute? Yeah, we'll... We'll just wait in the car. We will? So, I've thought a lot about us in the past few days. I was thinking, well, maybe I made a mistake. Oh, really. About what? You know, about breaking up with you. I mean, the prom's coming up and well, we make such a great couple. Do we?Well, yeah. I mean, everyone says so. Hell, we'll probably get voted king and queen. You know, Scott, you have a short goddamn memory. What? Gina's house last Saturday, you forget already? You take me to a party and end up screwing Melanie in the back bedroom. Is any of this sounding familiar to you? Come on, Kell. I mean, [SCOFFS] you know she doesn't mean anything to me. Obviously, neither do I. That's not true. You're my girl. I'm nobody's girl. And just to set the record straight, I broke up with you, asshole. And the last thing I wanna do is get back together. Hey, what is it with you?[SCOFFS] What do you... You want me to apologize or something? I don't want you to do a damn thing. Now get your hands off me. I suppose you'd rather go to the prom with that geek Virgil. Hey, that's not a bad idea. At least he has his brains in his head and not in his dick. ♪ One day I'll get rid of all the assholes ♪ Like you In my life ♪ One day I'll get rid of all the assholes ♪ Like you In my life ♪ In my life Oh, Virgil. Oh, Virgil, man. Virgil, check this out. Have you ever seen such a beautiful snatch? Ain't it incredible? Maybe if you're a gynecologist. Oh, shit, man, I'm telling you, this is the best magazine ever to jerk off to. You wanna use my bathroom? Hey, yeah. Can I? No, I guess I'll wait till I get home. [SQUAWKS] Dwayne's a whack-off. Oh, that's it. They say you're a parrot. A parrot's a bird. A bird's a chicken. And fat people love to eat chicken, so leave me alone or I'm gonna eat you. Fat fuck. Fat fuck, fat fuck. Oh, that's it! Virgil, get the frying pan. Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne!What? What? What? What? Oh, shit. You're arguing with a parrot.[SQUAWKS] Well, he started it. Okay, let's just forget about the parrot for now. Do you realize how completely cool I became today? How's that? Dude, Kellie kissed me, in public, right in front of everybody. Well, yeah, and you almost had your head handed to you. Remember that? [SIGHS] It was worth it. [LAUGHS] Do you realize if I had moved my head just a little bit, she would've kissed me right on the lips. Maybe you're right. Dude, if you're cool and I'm your best friend, dude, that makes me cool, too. [LAUGHING] Yes! Amy's such an airhead. We have high impact double step speed aerobics in an hour and she forgot her outfit. And, dork, why do you take a shower before you work out? Josh is going to be there. Geez, Deb, you want me to smell or something? Kell. Look, I... I know that you're pissed at Scott right now, but in a day or two, things will look different. Not a chance in hell. I hate that egotistical son of a bitch. You were kidding about going to prom with that geek, weren't you? His name is Virgil and I was only half kidding. Jesus, Kellie, do you wanna destroy your reputation totally? What's so bad about Virgil? Maybe he's a bit of a nerd, but... A bit? Get real. He's not bad looking, and he's smart and there's sort of an innocent charm about him. Are we talking about the same guy? Maybe you don't see it, but he's more of a man than you think. Mature, sophisticated, even worldly. [FARTING] [FARTING] [EXCLAIMS] Top that, bro. [FARTING] Okay. [GRUNTING] [FARTING] Gas mask! Gas mask! Oh, my God. [COUGHING] I gotta use your bathroom. I'm gonna get going. Okay, but you know, just think carefully before you do something you'll regret. Look, Deb, Virgil really saved my butt. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't graduate. What he did for me was very gallant. [SCOFFS] Gallant? Yeah, like one of King Arthur's knights. Oh, maybe you should buy him a suit of armor. [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] You know, I really wanna do something nice for him. Well, he's probably still a virgin. Why don't you just fuck him? [SIGHS] Now, why didn't I think of that? Oh, God, tell me you're joking. Relax. Not me, but Amy did give me a great idea. [MUSIC BLARING ON STEREO] I caught one. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? KELLIE: Virgil. Hi, Kellie. [MUSIC STOPS] Um... I'm just over at Debbie's house and we're talking about what a cool guy you are. Really? Yeah, really. What you did for me was very gutsy. I just don't know what I can do to thank you. [WHISPERS] Oh, dude! Blow job! [STAMMERING] I'm glad that I was able to help. That's all. That's what I like about you, Virgil. You're so nice. Thanks. I was thinking, if you're not doing anything tomorrow night, maybe you can come over to my house. We could, you know, have dinner, just kind of hang out. On a school night?[EXCLAIMS] Well, we could make it Friday if you want. No, tomorrow night is great. It's better. It's perfect. Okay. Well, my address is 234 Ashbrook and I guess I'll see you about 6:00? Okay, 6:00. Okay.Bye. Oh, man. Oh, man. I don't believe this. You and Kellie Guthrie alone together. Just the two of you. Oh, man, this is so great. What's the matter? Holy shit, Dwayne. I'm gonna spend a whole evening alone with Kellie Guthrie? I've never spent that much time alone with a girl before. [STAMMERING] What if I can't think of anything to say, or what if I just ramble on or I can't... What if she finds out that I'm really just, you know, a dork? Virge, you're not a dork, okay? So knock that shit off. Look, Kellie invited you, no one else. Out of all the guys in school, Kellie invited you. You're so cool. You're the Ice King. Till I melt down. No way, dude. I'm not gonna let that happen. You just listen to your old buddy. All you gotta do is think John Travolta. John Travolta? Yeah, as in Saturday Night Fever. Oh, man, that was so cool. He was, like, the coolest dude that ever lived. So that's all I gotta do, is just act like John Travolta. No, not act like. You gotta be John Travolta. It's all a matter of attitude. Well, attitude and a condom. Oh! Virge! We're talking hump city here, you know? Slipping her the sausage, stuffing the weenie, reeling out the old snake. What are you talking about? I'm talking about getting your V card punched. Her parents are gonna be there, for Christ sake. Oh, man, her parents are old. They're, like, 40. They'll be asleep by 9:00. Okay. Okay. I was saving this for myself, but what the hell, what are friends for? That's okay. I'll just... I'll pick one up myself. All right. Not that I'm gonna need it. Attitude, man. Look, think John Travolta and you will prevail. You are the Ice King. You know something, Dwayne, you're right. I know. Kellie invited me. Me, Virgil Heitmeyer.You. You. The Heitmeister. I'm cool.You're hot. I am the Ice King. I am John Travolta! Hey, hey, hey. Virge, Virge. Hey, hey, Virgil, Virgil, you think Debbie would go out with me if I asked her? You never know till you try. But I don't even have her phone number. Dude, you don't need her phone number. Star 69. Mmm? Remember. John Travolta, hmm? [EXHALES] [PHONE RINGING] [RINGING] Hello? Hey, Debbie. Hey, it's me, Dwayne. Yeah, Virgil's friend? You sure you got the right number? Well, I was sort of wondering if you weren't busy tomorrow evening, maybe me and you could, well, you know, sort of hang out? With you? Uh, yeah. [LAUGHING] [SCREAMS] I guess I'll take that as a no. [PARROT SQUAWKING] Big fat fuck. Sure. Go ahead and shit on me. Everyone else does. ELECTRONIC VOICE: If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again. [BANGING ON WINDOW] What the hell are you doing? Come on, hurry up and get dressed. Look, we gotta get to school early today. The sun isn't even up yet. Yes, it is. Please, Virge, I need your help. Come on, I'll explain later. This has gotta be a nightmare. Geez, Dwayne. I could've slept for another hour, you know. Oh, you could've slept for another hour. I haven't slept all night. So what is this, misery loves company? It's Debbie. What about her? I've been turned down by girls before. Lots of times, actually. So I'm pretty much used to it, but I have never, ever, ever have been shot down like that. It was pretty brutal. Well, she's not gonna get away with it. You're not thinking of doing anything stupid, are you? No. I'm thinking of doing something smart. Okay, because I'm familiar with your past schemes, and the fact that you haven't been expelled or thrown into jail, for that matter, I just kind of chalk up to pure dumb luck. See, this is different. Remember my Uncle Carmine I was telling you about? The one with the spy shop downtown? Right. Okay. Get off me. [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [WHISTLING] [EXHALES IN RELIEF] Okay. Stop. Okay. You're the lookout. You see anybody coming, you knock three times. Okay. What's that gonna do? I don't know. It'll give me a chance to hide or something. In the girls' room? Just do it, okay? We're running out of time. Okay, but you still haven't told me what we're doing yet. Okay. Margaret Lapinski told me that every morning before first period, Debbie goes into the last stall in the girls' bathroom. She's pretending to take a leak, but what she's actually doing is grabbing a smoke. [CHUCKLES] What's that? A miniature TV camera. Oh, no kidding. Uncle Carmine's got all kind of shit like this. Receiver, transmitter, anything the miniature camera can see can be sent to any television I want. Oh, okay. No. Are... Are you sure about this? I mean, this could totally backfire on you. Oh, after what Debbie did to me, I would say it's worth the risk. So, are you with me, bro? All right. Let's go get her. [SCHOOL BELL RINGING] [CHATTERING] Showtime.

Yeah, it's not a pretty picture, is it? No. So, do you know how to use a condom? What's to know? Geez, man, there is a technique. I mean, you don't wanna be fumbling around while Kellie's lying there waiting for you. Hi, Kell. Besides, I mean, if you're taking too long fumbling and stumbling, well, you know you could... Well... [IMITATES EXPLOSION] Before you even get to Kellie. Trust me on this one. Okay, what's the technique? Got any bananas at home? What, are you hungry? Okay, now hand me the raincoat. Hmm?The condom. Mmm, right, right, right. Okay. Now, the thing is, you need two hands to do this correctly. Technique.Right. Okay, so what we have to do now is... Okay, you hold the banana right there, while I put the rubber on. Wait a minute. Something's not right here. Ah! See, you don't put the condom on someone else, you put a condom on yourself. No shit. No shit. That's it. Shut up, you fleabag. I will feed you to the cat. Wait, wait, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.What?

Get behind me and reach around. Uh... Okay, look at that. What's going on? Relax. Just hold the banana out in front of me. All right.Okay? So, what you do now is, you take the condom from its wrapping, okay? Uh-huh.There you go. Place it on the tip of your dick. Gently, gently.Okay. Okay. Okay, yeah. And you just start unrolling it. Oh, yeah. Just like that. You see? You see how that works? Yes.Technique. Yeah, I like that.You like that? Yeah.I like it, too. Stanley! [DOORBELL RINGING] I can't let you do this, Kellie. I'm your best friend and I cannot stand by and watch you ruin your life. Are you okay?No! What are you talking about? I'm talking about you and the geek. You and Virgil spending the evening together. That's what I'm talking about. Debbie, you and I have been good friends for a long time, so I appreciate your concern. But this is really none of your business. But it is. Can't you see? As my friend, everything you do reflects on me. I spend an entire lifetime building this incredibly cool reputation and you're gonna tear it apart in five minutes? So, let me get this straight. This really isn't about me, it's about you. Well, yes, but Kellie... It's about you, too. I mean, this is what life is all about. If you can't be cool if you can't be popular, if you're not seen with the right people, then, well, what's the point of going to school at all? Oh, okay. Just go home, Deb. I can't deal with this right now. I need to get to the kitchen.Listen, Kell... I was just wondering... I mean, I'm probably gonna be grounded for a really long time, but I was just thinking that maybe after that, if you didn't mind, if it'll be okay with you if I... If I go after Scott. [CHUCKLES] You know, sure, that will be great. I actually think you two would make a really great couple. Really?Oh, really. [GASPING] Gee, thanks, Kell.Oh, sure. Bye. [PANTING] Hi. You're late. I know, I'm sorry. It's kind of a long story, but me and Virge, well, we sort of had a problem with a banana. Bananas are not on your diet. Way too many carbs. The problem was not eating the banana, it was putting the con... Forget it. What are you wearing? I thought you'd never been jogging before. My mom forced me to fat camp. Okay. Two miles today, then tomorrow we up it to three miles. Two miles? Like in miles? Mmm-hmm. And if we keep up a good pace, we can burn up to 1,000 calories per mile. But two miles? [SIGHING] We made a pact in school this morning, Dwayne. Or have you forgotten? No, I know we made a pact, both to lose 20 pounds before the senior prom, but... Right. And this is the only way we can do it. But two miles?Dwayne! [PANTING] Am I glad that's over. I couldn't have gone another foot. Dwayne, we've only gone a quarter of a mile. What? Come on, Margaret. You don't want me to have a heart attack, do you? I mean, if I had a heart attack, who would take you to prom? Okay. Maybe we're pushing it for today. But tomorrow we go again, right? You got it. You'll see, Dwayne, all the good things that can come from exercise! [BURPS] It's like working up a healthy appetite. Bring on the dogs. Aw, come on. I know times are tough, but I like a lot of sauerkraut. Kid, it's none of my business, but you gotta go easy on this sauerkraut. Are you kidding? This is the healthiest thing I've eaten all day.

How did you know that I like roses? Oh, I don't know. You just seem like a roses kind of person to me. You're late. I was beginning to worry about you. You were? Yeah. I mean, you're the kind of person who's always on time. You're very responsible. Thanks. So, what happened? Huh? Oh, it was a long story. There were sprinklers and they were like, [EXCLAIMS] and stuff. But it's okay. Now it's all good. Good. Unfortunately, I have some bad news. What? My grandmother's ill. She lives in Santa Barbara, so my folks drove up to be with her. They're not gonna be back till tomorrow. So it's just you and me. You're gonna have to put up with my cooking. Oh! Well, that's...

It's fine. It's fine. It's great. The pain is very mild. That's good. My dad has back problems, so I know how painful they can be. Well, it's much better, really. So, can I help you clean up? Oh, no. Clarietta, will get them in the morning. So what do you wanna do now? Well, what I'd like to do is tear your clothes off and fuck your brains out. What would you like to do? Wanna shoot some baskets?

[GRUNTS] [GROANING] [IN HIGH PITCHED TONE] Balls. Oh, no. Are you okay? Mmm-hmm. Well, is there anything I can do?

Oh, I know just what'll make you feel better. A hot Jacuzzi. Well, it'll help your back and your... Well, everything. Okay?Mmm. You wanna get up? Okay.Yeah. [BONE CRACKING][GRUNTS] Okay. Okay?Okay.

I have a little surprise for you later, okay? [DOORBELL RINGING] Hi, Kell. What are you doing here? Whoa. Whoa, what happened to, "Hi, Scott?" I'm really busy right now. Oh, come on, Kell, I just wanna talk to you for a minute. Hey, whose car is out front? Somebody over here? Oh, that would be none of your business. Now you and your boys need to go. Christ. I turn my back for five minutes, you're already screwing around with somebody else? What does it take to get through that thick skull of yours? You and I, if there ever was a you and I, are through. Finished. Kaput. Now, like I said befre, I'm really busy. Yeah?Yeah. Doing what? Entertaining a guest. [WHISTLING] SCOTT: Why do you always think I'm trying to start a fight? KELLIE: 'Cause that's what you do, Scott. You've got a typical jock mentality. Just because I happen to be a great athlete doesn't mean I don't care about people. Jesus, Scott, the only person you've ever cared about was yourself. You're jealous, aren't you? That's what this is all about. Well, it's not my fault that girls find me irresistible. You don't have a clue, do you?What? You are the shallowest, most narcissistic human being I've ever known. You've got some guy over here, don't you? Scott, give it a rest. Who is it? Just get out of here, Scott. I mean it. No, not until you tell me who it is. [PHONE RINGING]What, so you can get into a fight, show me what a macho jerk you are? DWAYNE: [ON ANSWERING MACHINE] If you're calling for Dwayne, I'm busy cooking dinner for my donkey. Shit! Would you just get out of here, Scott? Now! I mean it. No. It's not my fault that girls find me irresistible. [TOILET FLUSHING] Damn it, Kellie, stop playing head games with me. I don't give a damn what you say. You and I belong together and that's the way it's gonna be. Stop it, Scott. Hey, you... You just let her go. No, it's okay, Virgil. Scott was just leaving. Like hell I am. This is the little shithead you've been fucking around with? You get out of here, Scott, right now. I mean it. What? And who's gonna make me? You skinny little dork. [GRUNTS] [GASPS] [WHIMPERING] My arm's broken. It's my throwing arm. You son of a bitch, you broke my arm. I'm gonna sue the shit out of you. My dad's a lawyer. Yeah, you do that, Scott. I'm sure everyone in school will love to hear how Virgil broke your arm. Come on, Scott, let's go. [EXCLAIMING] Careful! God! Get me to an emergency room. Hurry up. Oh, shit. Coach is gonna kill me. Well, what do you think, Sir Galahad? Shall we try the Jacuzzi now? Huh. [WATER RUNNING] All ready? Well, that's a bathtub. It's a Jacuzzi. Oh, come on, we're in our bathing suits. Virgil, this will be good for you. Come on. Oh! Oh, oh, sorry. [GIGGLES] It's hot. Is the bathing suit okay? Yes, it's great. It's, you know, roomy. And how are you feeling now? Oh, my back is fine. I meant the other. [STUTTERING] That's fine. That's great. Not that it's, you know, great. It's just, it doesn't... Doesn't hurt anymore. So, I wanted to thank you for having me over tonight. Oh, it was the least I could do. I mean, after what you did for me. You were so brave and I'm not talking about what you did with Scott just then. I mean the way you stood up to Klausman. [LAUGHS] He didn't have a clue as to what was going on. Guess it was kind of funny. Why did you do it? Well, I guess I just didn't like the way that Klausman was talking to you, that's all. Yeah, but you could've gotten in a lot of trouble, and for someone you hardly knew. I mean, I've never even really been friendly towards you. And to tell you the truth, Virgil, I hardly knew you existed. I know that. Then why? Because I thought you were the most beautiful, most wonderful girl. And I knew that... I don't know. I... I knew a guy like me could never be with a girl like you, but... I mean, 'cause you could have anybody that you wanted, you know? You could... Like Scott, someone who's handsome and athletic and all that stuff. I mean, I can't... I can't compete with that. But still, I dreamed. And when Klausman started in on you, I just... I just felt I had to do something. Don't put yourself down like that, Virgil. You have so much more going for you than that jerk Scott. And I'm glad you did what you did. Otherwise we wouldn't have a chance together like this. Me, too. [SIGHS] You are nothing like I thought you'd be. How's that? Well... I don't know, a girl like you, you know, I mean, beautiful... Sometimes they can be really shallow. And they just don't care about anybody else, but you're different. You care about other people. I care about you, Virge. I care about you, too, Kellie. [DOORBELL RINGING] Uh... Oh, um... That, uh, surprise I was telling you about. I guess it's here. Oh, uh... Uh... Uh... Well, come on, Virge, this is for you. [EXCLAIMS] Um, just... Just wrap the towel around you and follow me. [SIGHS] Great. Just go in there. [DOORBELL RINGING] Am I on time? Yeah, just on time. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Are you Virgil Heitmeyer? [STAMMERING] Yes. I'll be in the other room. Well, then you are under arrest. What did I do? Oh, it's not what you did, Virgie. It's what I'm gonna do to you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Usually I just dance. [GULPS] But tonight, Virgie, tonight you're gonna get it all. [MUSIC STOPS] That was quick. You can say that again. Why? What happened? That's the point, nothing happened. You don't think he's, like, gay, do you? No. Not a chance.
