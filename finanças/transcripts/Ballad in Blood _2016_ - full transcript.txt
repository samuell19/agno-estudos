And some tweezers, go get the tweezers. Honey, can you give me a beer? And tweezers for our friend. Why is the beer in the bathroom? There's glass everywhere. [groaning] What do you want? Go clean up the mess you made in my bedroom. And change the sheets. [groans] I gotta wash all your vomit off me, you jerk. It was an accident. Sorry, okay? [groans] Big deal. [groaning] Big balls! Big balls! [groaning] Hey, friend. No tweezers. Fuck. I'll get it myself then. [groaning] [intense music] What happened to your friend? What friend? What the fuck did you do? Oh, shit.

[Lenka] You didn't have any clothes last night. [Duke] Showed up naked, did I? No, you were dressed as... I can't remember. My sweatsuit is in the laundry bin. I bet, where? In the bathroom. He can't just walk out on us. Okay. I'm going with him. [ominous music] Hi Mom, I don't have much time for filming today 'cause we're going shopping. Lenka. Lenka, where are you? Are you ready? Lenka. Lenka, are you home? Hey, come here. What the hell is going on here? [laughing] [Man] I got you. Oh God. Oh God. Lenka! Lenka! [laughing] [Man] Come on. We were supposed to go shopping today. You're always fucking around as usual. Sorry. Give me this. No shopping time today, Mommy. Sorry. Duke, you smell. It's these butt hugger pants you got me wearing. - Ciao! - I like tight pants. You look like Beyonce. [humming] [ominous music] Hey. Having a good night? How much you want? Fuck, Duke, I'm in heaven. Not before you pay me what you owe me, you're not. Actually, we've got a problem. We? I've got a problem. I'm listening. You've gotta cut me some slack. I'll pay you tomorrow. [laughs] [laughing] Why not next year? You know, Duke. Texas hold 'em, you know how it is. Nah, I don't know how it is. Help me with this, will you? You call me out in the middle of the fucking night. You already owe me a shit load of money. You can't pay me for yesterday's shit or the shit you want today. Is that how it is? No Duke, you're wrong. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm stupid. I'm stupid. No, you're not stupid. I'm just trying to say that... You think I'm, let me run this past you again. Do I look stupid to you? No, man, this is not about you. Oh, you're trying to rip me off. You think I'm some dumb Black from some hick town you can rip off? Hey man, come on. I'm not trying to cheat you. Not you. Tell him, guys, come on. [Group] Yeah! We're friends, right? Come on, come on, come on, Duke. I don't need much. Just a little ice, huh? - A little ice. - Yes. You know, enough to find a little inspiration. I'm no scam artist. We are buddies, right? Inspiration. Yes, yes. [groaning] Stop, stop. Shut the fuck up! This dick here's trying to fuck me over. I don't do charity, check his wallet. Okay, calm down. I wanna know everything he got in there. Don't move. Okay, okay. What else he got? 100 euros. Oh, looks interesting. [ominous music] - No, don't do that! - Tastes good. Cut you and fuck your ass, man! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dickhead number two, he got anything else? What the fuck is your name? Remo. Remo got anything else to offer us in there? No more cash, nothing but crap. Oh. Pills. [laughs] Surely Viagras. Viagra, huh? Can't get it up. Yeah, anybody ever tell you that's the fastest dick death known to man? So we are quits now? - Quits? - Yeah. Come here, follow me. [ominous music] This will freshen up your brain. Grab him! Grab him there! - Stop! - So you know what? I'm a take that four grams and daddy's allowance that he gave you. And I want my money tomorrow, you got that? Stop! - You got that? - Yes, yes, yes. I got that! I got it. I got it. I don't like coke. Really. Yeah, it fucks you up. Guys who snort coke all day, they're a fucking mess, brain dead, corpses. ♪ Dick in your mouth and play with my balls ♪ ♪ You can call me Mr. Right Now ♪ ♪ Dick in your mouth and play with my balls ♪ ♪ You can call me Mr. Right Now ♪ You want a beer, man? Okay. Give me two beers. How much is it? - 14 euro. - 14? It's all we have, Chance Beer. Pay the man and drink the fucking beer. What's up with your friend? I don't know. Maybe he's dead. [laughing] You're a laugh a minute, Leo. [laughs] The rent. The rent! Money. Oh, don't look at me. I don't live there. That's my girlfriend's house. Hey dude, we don't give a shit how you spend your fucking money. We just want the rent. Two months' rent, understand? We're talking about throwing them out. Duke, let's go. 14 euros for this rat piss. He should kiss the ass of every single student who goes to his shitty pub. Whatever, man. All right, I'll catch you around. Wait, we have to go back. Otherwise, Lenka will call the cops. Cops, I didn't... Lenka? Who's Lenka? Lenka, her name's Lenka. It's Czech. Oh, that bitch. I thought she was American. No, her mom moved to the States when she was a kid. You didn't know her name? What were you doing at her place? What were you doing there? Oh, Lenka's my girl. Your girl? Yes, my girl, okay? I really love her. It's called true love. Hey, not my problem, man. Not my problem. What the fuck would you know. [ominous music] I don't know if it's your problem or not. I'm going back to try and solve this shit. You'd better watch your ass 'cause if I fail, then we'll see if it's your problem. Asshole. Hey wait up, man, wait up. [thunder rumbling] Lenka got a real shock from fucking Elizabeth. She was always accusing her of being too straight. You definitely know how to pick them, huh? You met her folks yet? You're an insensitive shit, you know that? [laughs] I love you too. You know what? I just decided, I don't love you no more. [ominous music] [music intensifies] Now we know where they live. [Duke] Hey, where's the body? It's gone. Lenka? [ominous music] Lenka. [ominous music] Lenka! [ominous music] Hey, Duke. Look at this. Damn. Lenka cleaned up everything. I don't know why. - Damn. - Lenka! Lenka! Are you here? Lenka! Where the fuck did she go? Lenka? Lenka. Where are you? - Hey! - Come on, answer. [Duke] Hey! Are you in here? Fuck, she's not here. Where the fuck is your girl, man? I don't know where she is. [water trickling] Oh fuck. What the fuck? Lenka! - [knocking] - Open the door! Lenka. Call her again, call your girl. What are you doing? Lenka, come on. Lenka! Let's knock it down. Let's do it, let's do it. Okay. On three. One. - Two. - Two. Three, go! What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing there? Wake up, you dumb bitch! Where'd you put the body? Did you call anyone? Lenka. Can you hear me? Huh? - Did you call anyone? - Hey. - Hey! - What the fuck are you doing here, huh? Get her outta there, get her outta there. Get her outta here. Take off this. Lenka. Oh shit! What the fuck. - Oh shit. - What the fuck have you done? I'm a drown this bitch! Whoa, dude! [screaming] Fuck you! - I'm tired of your games. - Stop it, please. - That's enough. - What'd you say? You say you were a fucking whore? - Stop it! - Get down! Fuck, you're crazy, I'm tired of it. - Don't! - Hey, hey! Get the fuck down, bitch! Down! Down! I'm tired of this bitch! Lenka. What a cool idea to use this antique bathroom. Yeah you're right. It'll freshen up your head a little bit. [laughs] Oh. Your chick's fucking insane, man. Turn that damn dryer off. Turn that goddamn dryer off. What you planning on doing with the body? Elizabeth liked being clean. So it's true. You're insane as well as being a fucking whore. Don't you call me a fucking whore. That's enough, Duke. Oh great, you too. Your chick's floating off in space somewhere and you're protecting her. No, Lenka gave me the idea. What idea? To have the dead body come and take a bath with us? No. Only to get her out of here. How? Where? I don't know. Somewhere. They'll find her and think the big bad wolf killed her. This ain't the Middle Ages. Release the body, those forensic dudes will still find a trace of something. You can't trick them. One look at the body and they'll fucking nail your ass. So what? She lived here and was killed here. But who by? I have my own place. I can swear that Lenka slept at my house. What about you? Huh? And our prints? DNA? Everyone knows this place is like a home away from home. You have no idea what goes on in here. Right, busy little thing, aren't you? That's none of your fucking business. You got that right, my American friend. I'm Czech, you fucking ugly ape. Where do you come from? I bet you don't even know who your mother is. Did they find you in the garbage dump? Bitch! Whoa. [scoffs] That's it? That's your best shot? Fuck you! - And fuck you too! - Both of you. And fuck this bitch too. He's crazy. Get rid of him. Make up your mind. First you want him to come back. Now you want me to get rid of him. Yeah. We'll cut her to pieces. Great fucking idea. You do it. Cut her, cut her in pieces, you do it. Why me? Cut her to pieces, cut her. Fucking faggot. See what you've done? You made him cry. ♪ Don't you cry my little ♪ For crying out loud, I'll do it then. Leave my friend alone, you piece of shit. [screams] No! You people deserve each other. I want to know what happened here last night. Where does it say we killed her? Where are you going now? Hey, it's all right. Don't cry. [ominous music] Too big. I need something sexy. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Got some big titties. What are you looking for? [ominous music] Guys, look. It's loaded with videos. Hi, these are all students from my university. Hello, Professor. [crowd chatting] Hey, what's happening? [Crowd] Bye, Professor! But, but, what? What? [Crowd] Bye! What's happening? Where are you taking me? Bye! [laughs] Made it. It's a pain in my ass, man. Put on another one. Which one? There are hundreds of them. - Lenka. - Come up with something. Hey. What happened to Professor Eli Roth? He disappeared. No, some students kidnapped him for a couple of hours so they wouldn't be tested. They took him to a really fancy restaurant and gave him some really good food and really good wine. And apparently, he really enjoyed it and didn't get angry at all. [laughing] That's amazing. Switch it off. [Lenka] So yeah, the party. Wait, maybe Elizabeth filmed something last night. And downloaded it already? Yeah, from her cell phone. She always... Her cell phone! Hey Mom, this is our local market. Oh, look at these flowers. Aren't they beautiful? What are you looking for? Elizabeth's cell phone. She must have filmed us last night. The phone's not here. I already looked. Someone must've taken it. Someone? Someone who? This is Leo's pub. Leo, the best barman in the city. Bartender. This is Arden. I'm teaching Leo English. I'm teaching Elizabeth Italian. Yeah. [speaks in foreign language] [laughing] You said dickhead. What? You taught me that. This is a video postcard for my parents and friends at home in England. I'll have to cut that bit out. [ominous music] [laughing] What the fuck? [ominous music] [humming] Hello, my friend, Francesca. Hello! [laughs] This video is dedicated to all of my perverted friends. This Erasmus program is fucking crazy. And how many of you live here? We have three beds. But we can get up to 15 people at night. [Elizabeth] Wow. Everyone comes and goes as they please. And he's our painter. He's imitating Conova and she is Aphrodite. And they are trying to study. And she's doing yoga. She's relaxing. And he is working out. We have everything we need here. [ominous music] Get rid of Duke. [ominous music] Why? He's crazy. He'll get us in trouble. We're visiting Ivan. He's been sick for days. [groans] [laughs] What a fucking liar, look at him! [laughing] Hello? Wakey-wakey. [chuckles] Hi. She's a sleepyhead. Francesca, what... Even this can happen here. Love you. [chuckles] [laughing] Hi Mom, this is our house and this is my thinking corner with my books. And now I'll show you the rest. I didn't do much painting yet. Upstairs. My kingdom. Do you like it? [ominous music] Oh, for fuck's sake. Introducing the star of my little film and the naughty girl just forgot to flush the loo. Can you just fucking leave me in peace and let me pee alone? [slams door] What's wrong? My hair hurts. So upstairs in that little ass room up there is where it all went down. And nobody knows shit? Why did she make all those videos? It was her thing. She wanted to be a movie director or something like that. Poor thing. All your dreams shattered. What did they do? What did they do to her? [phone vibrating] [ominous music] Elizabeth. Right, calling from the bathroom. What? I guess she ran out of toilet paper. Why aren't you answering the phone? I can't. That's Elizabeth in there, right? Of course it's her. You know another Elizabeth? - Answer the phone! - No. - No! - Answer the goddamn phone! Give it to me. Hello? [Francesca] Lenka? It's for you, come on. Hello? This is Francesca. I'm calling on Elizabeth's mobile. Oh right. She left it on me yesterday evening. She took some great shots [laughs] of you two with a crazy guy. Who is he? Where did he come from? Who? The guy dressed as a skeleton. [laughs] He was cool. [laughs] I got the whole show. You guys were really into each other, huh? Listen, I have to go. Tell Elizabeth she can come by anytime. I'm going back home now. Yeah. She's sleeping right now. Maybe I'll come pick it up. I'll call you. Okay, bye. Poor Francesca. Big mistake on your part. Hello. [laughs] Hey, let's go over there, let's go! [laughs] Now we have to get rid of the phone, the SIM card, and you. But first. Let's put Elizabeth to bed. [groans] Don't hurt her. [groaning] [ominous music] Okay, so this is the place. I'm gonna go get Francesca. You guys wait here. - Whatever. - All right? Talk some sense into her, Duke. Me? You're the one with the free access to her neurons. This is not a good idea. Okay, take some of this, man. - This will cheer you up. - Oh, yes. You all right? [inhales] I'm good, I'm good, I had enough. Why? Fuck it. [inhales] [ominous rhythmic music] Get off! [speaks in foreign language] [ominous music] - Boo! - Oh God. You scared the shit outta me. Here you go. Thank you. Look, there is some creepy people out there. Someone just tried to attack me. Oh. Would you mind going with me? Quickly then, Forenzo will be here soon. I mean, look at me, I'm a fucking mess. I have to change, take a shower. He's paranoid about some things, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know. Thank you. Okay, let's go. Let's go. [ominous music] Coke makes my nose go dry. I hate coke. [ominous music] So how did it go this evening? Who was the guy with the mask? Does he have big dick? Did you do a threesome? Did you get Mother Superior Elizabeth to play? [laughs] Oh, it was so boring here. [shivering] It's getting cold. Let's forget this and go home. Keep still, man. You're making me nervous. I have to go now. No, just this bit. So we go through here. [engine rumbling] Come here, you fucking bitch. Why are you still wearing your costume? - Forenzo. - You're gonna tell me the battery on your mobile died? No, Forenzo, please. You think you can jerk me around? - Hey, what are you doing? - Go away. Hey, leave her alone. Hey, you bitch, go away! [Francesca] I don't want to go with you. Hey, who the fuck do you think you are? - No! No! - Get on, get on. Come back! Francesca! We'll get things straight at home. Hey, you piece of shit. [groans] Fuck off, you son of a bitch! [groans] [ominous music] [screams] Oh shit, stop pissing. Who are you shouting at? - Leave me alone. - What are you doing here? - Shut up, will you? - This is my place. Oh, maybe Lenka got hurt. - Get off! - I can't sleep. I can't rest with all you fucking - damn people. - Will you leave me alone? I'll leave you alone, - you leave me alone. - Here they come. Lenka's bringing her straight to us. What a fucking genius. I'll destroy this. That doesn't look like Francesca. - Where you come from? - What? - Czech. - No, that's her. Bitch is still wearing her costume. Give me some, huh? - Give me money. - I don't have any money. Leave me alone. I'll tell you. - Give me some money. - Leave me alone. [Old Woman] I need it. What can I say? Give me the money, I'm an old woman, I need it. No! No! [screams] No! You fucking idiots, why? Why did you do that? [Jacopo] Relax, Lenka, relax. - What the fuck? - Don't look. [Duke] You changed your mind, you should've told us. [Jacopo] Yeah, we did exactly as you said. Exactly as you said. They'll think it was an accident. [Duke] Fucking beautiful accident. That wasn't Francesca. Yeah, they'll find her. She was full of booze and dope and... What? - It was an old woman! - Old woman? How old? Yeah, how old? I don't know how old. Ancient, decrepit, all right? What the fuck were you doing with an ancient, decrepit old woman? What happened to Francesca? Her asshole boyfriend showed up and took her away. The bastard even hit her. Damn, really? Yeah, what a scumbag. I hate men who beat women. [laughs] You hate men who beat women? Hello, you wanted us to kill, what's the bitch's name? - Francesca. - Francesca, yeah. You forgot that? Look, you're really starting to piss me off. Why did you kill her? We thought she was your friend Francesca. Yeah, and now... That poor old woman's in heaven. She was an old hag. An old hag who couldn't fly. - [laughs] - Who couldn't fly. Couldn't fly. [Lenka] Couldn't fly. - That silly man. - Fly! [Lenka] Couldn't fly. [clock chimes] I got an idea that might just work. What idea? Better be a good one. [ominous music] Who is he? [Duke] That's Leo. Who the fuck is Leo? [shushes] Relax, relax. It's okay. I am tired. [speaks in foreign language] Who are you? What do you want? How did you get in here? You don't remember me? Look at me. Look at me. I'm Leo. Someone tell me what's going on here. Who are you? What do you want? Quiet, quiet. [speaks in foreign language] What the fuck do you want? This is my house. Remember? Huh? Remember what? Are you two just gonna stand there? Who is this guy? You don't remember the gin tonic? The pepper? The pickle? No lemon? You're the barman. Bartender. What do you want? How did you get in here? All right, all right, that's enough. Leo, what the fuck do you want? Don't shout, don't shout! The rent. The rent! The rent, the money. Come back tomorrow. Morning. Tomorrow morning. [slams door] Do you think he suspects? No way. How can you be so sure? Oh my God, he knows. - He knows everything. - He don't know shit. Your keys. [laughs] Oh, I forgot my friend. My friend, sorry. [ominous music] Arden. Arden! Sleeping. Wake up, wake up! [speaks in foreign language] Leo's brother doesn't have his patience. He'll be back tomorrow first thing. Well, we had a problem with the bank. - Right. - Yeah. But if you call our landlord... - Yeah, Leo's brother. - Yeah, yeah, Leo's brother. - Exactly. - Yeah. We talked to him and everything's settled now. - And that's what happened. - That's what happened. He has the key. Tomorrow you have to pay your rent. - Okay. - All right. Done. [speaks in foreign language] Yeah, she deserve a decent burial. I dressed her. [speaks in foreign language] [ominous music] How dare he dress you like this? [groans] It's like you're ready for your funeral. This is awful, it's terrible! Cover the whole body. Damn, this bitch is a whale. She was always talking about getting on a diet. [groaning] Easy, easy. [cat meows] [muffled rock music] Wait, wait. Why did you close that door? There's someone in there. No, they're away. They leave the door open and music on so it looks like someone was at home. For Satan too. - Satan? - The cat. They let it come and go as it pleases. Ah, I saw him. - So what about Satan? - Fuck Satan, let's go. [ominous music] [cat meowing] [ominous music] It'll never fit in here. [truck beeping] [ominous music] Masks, mannequin. Why do they leave this crap here? Haven't these people heard about recycling? [Worker] Sexy glove, will your sister like it? Nah, leave it here. - [screams] - [Worker] Hey man, come on. [ominous music] What the fuck? [squeaks] [screams] Oh my God! [laughing] Fuck off. [laughing] Idiot. [squeaks] No, no, I'll dress her. I'm gonna dress her. [beeping] [phone vibrating] Oh no. [phone vibrating] Who is it? It's Mom. [phone vibrating] Come on. Answer. Hi, Mom. [Mother] Hi Lenka, how are you? I'm good, how are you? How's your holiday? [Mother] Oh, the weather here in San Francisco is terrible. It's really the end of the world. It's done nothing but rain all week long. Hey, by the way, you know that Ginger almost died? Oh, really? [Mother] Yeah, that poor thing. The vet blamed it on poison or something toxic but I think it was that bitch, Mrs. Kundra. You know how she is, she hates the world and everything in it. Have you had dinner yet? It's six o'clock in the morning here, Mom. [Mother] Six o'clock, oh God, I got it wrong again, sorry. David, David, you're wrong. It's six o'clock in Italy. Come on, come and say hi to Lenka. [David] Hi, Lenka. Hi, David. [David] Sorry, but your mom gets me confused. So how are you doing? We saw the pictures, you and Elizabeth look really happy. How is she, by the way? Hello? Lenka, you there? Lenka? Yes, yes, I'm here. Sorry, it's a bad line. I just lost you there for a second. Elizabeth's good. [David] Okay listen, your mom wants to tell you something. It's a surprise. Bye, sweetie. [cat meows] [Mother] Honey pie, you know that we decided to come visit you in Italy? How about that, are you happy? Lenka. Lenka, dear. Honey, hello? Mom. I just can't talk right now. I'll call you later. [Mother] Okay, okay, sorry. Bye honey, I'll talk to you later then, bye. [soft music] [intense rhythmic music] How much? 20 euro. [speaks in foreign language] Oh, this shit is, fuck this shit. Let me see if I can speed this up. [speaks in foreign language] If you want some drugs, come here and let me know. This motherfucker's crazy. [laughs] Oh shit, hey yo. - Come check this out. - Calm down. Calm down, baby. Come on, come on, come on. [intense rhythmic music] Okay, sit down here, sit down. Look at this shit. [intense rhythmic music] Yeah! I don't remember this party. It's funny. - What party is this? - Fun, not funny. Hi, Elizabeth. [laughs] [cheers] Welcome to hell, bitches! [laughs] Hi, Elizabeth. Why aren't you drinking? No, I don't want to. Come on, have some fun. Come on! [cheering] [chanting] Drink! Drink! Drink! [laughing] This is the best party ever! [laughing] Get off! Get off her clothes. Naked! [cheering] Don't remember anything. Me neither. - We were there. - That's cool, yeah. Fuck's sake. [intense rhythmic music] It looks like... [screams] - Fuck off! - Fuck. [laughs] Idiot. I found it upstairs. [laughs] Is that you? Does it look like me? [intense rhythmic music] [Elizabeth] Can you film us together? - Yeah, my darling. - Thank you. Hey! Oh, hi. Elizabeth, I have a surprise for you. [laughing] Here you are, hello. - His gloves. - So what? Maybe he's trying to hide the color of his skin. And who is he trying to hide it from? So. We'll see it again. I have a surprise for you. [laughing] Here you are, hello. Hey, hey, let's all go over there. Let's go, go, go, go, go. Elizabeth wasn't meant to understand. Hold up, hold up, where the fuck do you get off thinking I'm the mass asshole? Shut up. It's all coming back in my mind. There's something that, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll show you. And what was your last best intention? Oh, that was Mambo Maleck. Mambo Maleck? Yuck, I know him, can't stand him. Why? Mambo's Black. It's politically incorrect to say Black. You say African-American or African wherever they're from. And they have bigger dicks. [laughs] No, that's pure myth. I'm not being racist. I have loads of Afro wherever they're from friends. It's a question of chemistry. I'm not attracted to them sexually. Well, do you want to bet that I can get you to change your mind about that? No because size doesn't count. [laughs] Of course it does. Mm-mm. Elizabeth posted it two months ago. Fuck you talking to me for? Why do you think? A surprise for you. Lenka. Was Duke the surprise? Why surprise, huh? Ask her. Where are you going? Wait, Elizabeth. I have your cell phone. Here, Elizabeth. I love you. See? It doesn't take a lot of imagination, does it? Mrs. Princess, won't you enlighten us? 'Cause this shit is way over my head. [Lenka] Okay, so we were leaving the party and... Hey, guys! [laughs] [cheering] Hey, hey guys, listen, listen. I'm tired. - Oh, come on. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm going home now. - No! Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's enough. - Enjoy the party. - Oh whatever, let's go. - Bye! - Bye. [screams] [intense rhythmic music] [screaming] Elizabeth, why didn't you dress up? - Elizabeth. - It's your turn now. [laughs] You scared me to death. [cheers] Come on. We brought a costume, put it on. [Man] And have some gin, girl. - Come on. - Have some gin. Join our party. [laughs] [groans] I brought a surprise for you. Oh. [laughs] [ominous music] [Man] Some of this, come on. [ominous music] [Lenka] I have another surprise for you. No, I don't want him. - Yes, you do. - No. - Yes, you do. - No. [Lenka] Yes. No. No! [whimpers] Please. [whimpers] Why? [shushes] No. Please. [shushes] [ominous music] [chuckles] Don't cry, Elizabeth. Don't cry. No, get off me. [chuckles] Leave me. Leave me, please. No. I can't breathe. [Man] Come here. [groaning] [Lenka] Shut up, you'll like it. [sobbing] [Duke] And then? [Lenka] And then you killed her. I killed her? Was I at the party? We all were. I don't remember shit. 'Cause you were stoned out of your head, just like everyone else. Wait. This isn't something you two lovebirds put together to fuck me over, is it? It's fucking logic, pure and simple. We were at the party and then? Then we left. Where did we go? We came here. To do what? To listen to the Nightwish? So what the fuck? She doesn't want the big black and then boom, another English girl dead? Nah, nah, that's too easy. Look, I don't know what happened. But I mean, you... If there was a trial, who do you think they'd believe? What's your point? You? Where were you and him? And who's to say there wasn't someone else there? Who? You saw the video, there was no one else. I... I remember chaos and... I thought I dreamt it but... There was blood everywhere and there was a knife. A knife. I don't even have a knife. Look, if there's someone here ready to carve people into little pieces, that's you. I loved Elizabeth. She was like a sister to me. You want to know what happened? Don't touch me. [ominous music] Pure fantasy. We knew the truth. [screaming] Go get a knife. [Elizabeth] No. You love him. [screaming] Come on, you like that shit. You love it, you love him. Just fuck him, Elizabeth, just fuck him. Shut up, Elizabeth. Shut up, why won't you do it? Just do it, Elizabeth, do it. Just do it, just fuck him, Elizabeth. Shut up, you bitch, just fuck him. Fuck him. Just do it, you bitch, just do it. Do it, do it, you'll love it. You'll love it. Just fuck him. Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him, just do it! Do it! Do it, Elizabeth. Just shut up, you bitch, and do it. Do it! Do it! [ominous music] My beautiful blossom. [ominous music] Have some. [ominous music] Damn. Look at what I got here. [ominous music] Hey, look what I found. Yeah, you got a kick out of provoking Elizabeth, didn't you? I know. Yeah, you did it. And your boyfriend knows it too. You did everything to involve Elizabeth 'cause you liked her innocence. Her innocence turned you on. All fun and games for Lenka, huh? No, no, not the Black man. And look at him. He's another one of your boy toys. Fuck you. She did it. She's the one who did it. She's the one who planted the knife, I'm telling you. Last night I remember, she was fucked up. She was a little over the edge, then she stuck it right in her goddamn neck. Okay. Fucking hungry, this goddamn. Don't y'all eat in this goddamn house? Where are you going? [Lenka] I'm going to the police. - Are you crazy? - Let me go! What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, huh? He was masked. Don't you get it? [slams door] [ominous music] So what's the plan? We're back where we started. [Duke] Which was? I don't know. Let's lose the knife. And then what? Then... Then I don't know, okay? How you doing? Lenka. You're coming with me. No, Lenka stays. Why? One go, two stay, that's the rule. What rule? Look, I don't trust you, all right? Duke's right, Jacopo. You go, we'll wait here. Okay. [ominous music] Beep beep, beep beep. [laughing] [laughing] Who else? [laughing] Hiya, boy. [laughing] [phone beeping] [phone vibrating] [laughing] Ooh. [laughing] [playful music] Hello. [laughing] [soft music in foreign language] What's up? What did he tell you about me? That cornflake? What do you see in him? Are you going to kill him? [ominous music] Hey, what's up? Sit down. Sit down. What do you got there? You want to go to jail? No. That's not a nice place for a pretty boy like you. Please. [ominous music] [tires squealing] [laughing] [Man] My knife is bigger. Stop! [laughing] Get out of my way, please. Put the knife down. I'll lose it for you. I'll lose it for you. He's really good at losing things. No one will ever find it. I'll lose it for you. [humming] [tires squealing] [laughing] [popping] [toy gun firing] [Duke] What happened? Some bastards just threw a firecracker. A firecracker? You all right? [glass shattering] Whoa! Come on. [screaming] Fuck you all! Fuck you, you motherfuckers! [screaming] Oh, you're finally here, you pieces of shit. Hey, did you throw the TV out? Yes, from now on, we do things my way. You two really piss me off. What's that, smashing up the apartment? No, faking a break-in. Bullshit, police will never buy that. You got another idea? No, okay. Fuck it. Come on! [groaning] [shattering] No, no, no, no, not that. - Why not? - It was a present. Oh. [shattering] [ominous music] [cheers] [groaning] Here, take some of that. Hey, listen up. The police are gonna question us separately. So we gotta have a great story and stick to it. They're gonna check your every move, your every word, and every text message. So you guys better be convincing, got it? Give me some of that beer, man. Just messages of love. Fuck you talking about? And Elizabeth? [ominous music] The fuck are you doing? Why'd you drop her like that, you piece of shit? You hurt her. Idiot, shut up! - Control your... - You piece of shit. - You asshole. - Control your girl! - You really pissed me off! - Bitch! I've had enough of you, you idiot! I'm gonna kill you! That bitch is crazy. The fuck is wrong with her? - Come on. - Shit. You're crazy, you piece of shit. You psycho. - Psycho. - I'm a take her. - I got her, I got her. - Shut up. I'm busting my ass over here. Nobody want to give me goddamn credit. Shit, fuck it, I got it. Poor you, poor you. [groans] [ominous music] Piece of shit. [ominous music] Hey, let's tear up the kitchen too so they think a thief got hungry, found nothing to eat, and just trashed the place. Let's do it. [ominous music] [shattering] Out of the way, out of the way. [shattering] [ominous music] Shit. Fucking hungry. Damn. Don't y'all got anything in this fridge? Fuck is this? [clanging] Hey, what do y'all eat when you get... [groaning] [ominous music] [screams] No! No! No. [soft music] No. [soft music] [whimpering] I love you. I love you too. Maybe he didn't want to kill us. Yes, he did. He did. He would've gotten away with it too. He wore a mask. He wore a mask. No one at the party knew it was him. I love you. I love you. [sobbing] What a shame! We got here too late. I would have loved to take care of him personally.
