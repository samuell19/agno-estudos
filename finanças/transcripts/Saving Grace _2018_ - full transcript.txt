What I was doing is I sent him a message. I sent it to responding to one of his Instagram stories. I didn't, I hadn't even met him. Hello? (upbeat music) Anybody home? - Sorry. - Saz, it's our last night together and you're not even here. - I know, it's just like, Martha's losing it. Do you know I found her naked in the back garden? Don't, it's not, no, you know what? She gets worse every day. - Yeah, look, if she's that bad she's gonna end up in a home anyway. - Yeah, maybe. - All right. (hands tapping) Here is to (Sarah laughs) Saturday nights, big city living, and new beginnings. - To new beginnings. (glasses clink) - Ah, that's bad. (glasses clink) All right, (laughs) come on, you owe me a dance. (Katy laughs) - All right, done. (upbeat music) (ladies giggling) He was so gross. - He was hot. - How wasted are you exactly? - I'm a seven. - (laughs) You're at least a 10. - (laughs) I'm definitely a 10. (ladies laughing) - Stop it. (laughs) I, (laughs) I actually can't. Oh, God. Make the spinning stop. - What's the matter, are you a lightweight? - How are you still going? - Because it's a Saturday night. And the only thing I have to look forward to tomorrow is changing Joyce's bedsheets. - I'm gonna be sick. (laughs) Ah. (Sarah exhales) - I'm gonna miss you. - Come on, it's not the other side of the world. You can come and visit. Plus, you have your new boyfriend back there now, remember? - I do, actually. (laughs) - Mm. - You haven't even told me where you're going. And Martha, you're like a daughter to her, it's gonna kill her you leaving. - Would that really be such a bad thing? (Sarah laughs) - You're the worst carer ever, you know that? - You know I don't mean it though. Come on. (calm music) - What am I gonna do without you? You're like the closest friend I have in this city. The only friend, actually. - We'll stay in touch. - Yeah, but it's not the same, is it? - Come on, I need to do this, for me. Come on. - (laughs) Okay. - I'm gonna take you home, mm-hmm. (grunts) (ladies laugh) (calm music continues) Sweet dreams, beautiful. - You two, babe. Are you gonna be okay? - I always am. I don't know, ugh. - Text me when you get home - Mm-hmm. and don't forget my postcard.

(insects chirping) - Your luxury cruiser awaits. - [Sarah] Awesome. - All aboard. (seagulls squawking) (calm music) (calm relaxing music) (boat engine revving) (boat engine purring) (calm relaxing music continues) (calm relaxing music continues) (calm relaxing music continues) - Is it far? - What? - Is it far? - Oh, about 10 minutes in this old thing. It's nice and quiet here at the moment. That'll change once winter's over though. - It's beautiful. - Yeah. I grew up in the next bay. So, what are you running away from? - What do you mean? - Well, someone like you in a place like this, you are running away from something, or someone. - Is that the one? - She's a beauty, ain't she? (calm music) (boat engine purring) (calm music continues) (birds chirping) (insects chirping) (insects chirping) (calm music) (camera lens whirring) (suspenseful music) (camera shutter clicks) (camera whirring) - Albert, is there anyone in the cottage to meet me? - Not a soul. Got the house to yourself. And Grace, of course, couldn't ask for a more quieter housemate. - I just, I just thought I saw someone. - Seeing things already? The others gave it a couple of days before they started going a bit loopy. You head on up to the house. I'll grab your bags. (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (bird chirping) (insects chirping) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (lift whirring) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (exhales sharply) There you go. Well, I'll leave you to get settled in. If you need anything, well, I'm up at the cottage at the back of the house, so. - Sure, thanks, Albert. (footsteps plodding) (leaves rustling) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) (door squeaks) (door creaking) (knocking on door) (gentle music) (door squeaking) Hi, Grace. I'm Sarah. Your new carer. (gentle music continues) Wow. (wardrobe door creaking) Oh my goodness, what a beautiful view. Oh, no stress, I'll fix that. Are you hungry? You know what? It's way past lunchtime. I'll make you something to eat, any requests? That's what I thought. I'll make your favorite. (wardrobe door squeaks) There you go. Be right back. (seagulls squawking) (insects chirping) All right, here we go. Last one. Mm, did you enjoy that? Ooh, what have we over there? Ooh. Is swing your favorite?

Yeah, I guess. God, it is beautiful here. - Yeah, it certainly is. - How long have you worked here for, Albert? - (laughs) Too long. I've been here since well before she was, you know? - I'd actually, I'd wanted to ask what happened but, in my interview, but it just wasn't the right place or the time to ask. And I'd heard what happened. - Ah, it's okay, um, it was six years ago. She was out with her sister. Uh, they were identical, you know, twins, did everything together. Loved the attention they got from strangers. (laughs) A-and they were really competitive, they always liked to get the one up on each other. You know? (calm music) (insects chirping) (birds chirping) - Cheers. - To good health. - To absent friends, to Arthur. - Mm, this is really quite lovely. - Only the best for us birthday girls. (Grace laughs) - I'm so glad Glen and the kids could make it. - (sighs) Honestly, they're wearing me out, as much as I love them. (Grace laughs) Come on, let's show them how it's done. - Wha-what, have you gone loopy? (Ada imitates chicken clucking) (laughs) Oh, don't be ridiculous. - For old times sake? - Not a chance! - Fine. Be boring. - Dear lord. (gasps) (calm music continues) (Grace laughs) (Ada gasps) - Come on! We used to do this all the time. - (scoffs) You're crazy, you know that? - Ha, you've got to live a little! (laughs) (leaves rustling) (insects chirping) (Ada breathes sharply) - Oh! (laughs) (water splashes) (Grace laughing) (gentle suspenseful music) (Grace exhales sharply) Ada? Ada! (suspenseful music) Ada! (shrieking) Oh! (suspenseful music continues) (water burbling) (Grace panting) Ada! - Shit. Shit, that, that's awful. - Yeah. - Oh my God, and Ada was gone? - Yep. It all just changed then. - Poor Grace. - She hasn't been the same since. I mean, they were so happy together. But apart, well, there she is. I think all she does is murmur now. (stammers) And she gets a bit worse every year. - I saw pictures of you with her in the wheelchair. - Oh, yeah, I used to take her down to the water, s-s-sit for a while, relax. But I just, she wouldn't recognize me or, or, or where she was. She's like a mum to me. Best mum I ever had. Anyway, must make a fire. - Yeah. - Get on. - Yeah, yeah, me too, better go. - [Albert] You know where I am if you need anything. - Sure, thanks, Albert. - Okay. (Sarah humming) (suspenseful music) (wheelchair thuds) - Grace? (floorboards creaking) (owl hooting) (door squeaks) Grace? (wardrobe door creaks) (ghostly exhale) (suspenseful music) (spirit exhales ghostly) (wardrobe door creaks) (suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music) (Grace murmurs) (floorboards creaking) Grace? Did you say something, Grace? (ornament clanks) (dramatic music) Shit. (Sarah breathing sharply) (laughs) Grace, let's not do that one again, hey? (laughs) Whoo, I think it's time for bed. (light switch clicks) (suspenseful music) Goodnight. (door creaks) (dramatic suspenseful music) (spirit exhaling ghostly) (insects chirping) (bird chirps) (bird chirps) (insects chirping) (insects chirping) (bird chirps) (insects chirping) (birds chirping) (floorboards creak) (door squeaks) Morning, Grace. It is a beautiful day outside. I've even made you breakfast. (birds chirping) (insects chirping) (chuckles) This is the life, hey, Grace? - Morning. - Hey, Albert, wait up. I'm, I'm gonna be right back, all right? - There she is. (Sarah laughs) So you survived your first night then? - Yeah, I was super tired though so it probably was not a big accomplishment. - Well, big day yesterday. Where you say you're from again? - I didn't, um, just a little place up the coast. - Ah. - Yeah, you probably wouldn't know it. - Ah, you'd be surprised. - Yeah? - So what's on the cards for today? - I'm actually gonna go exploring, I think. - Good. - Yeah? - Perfect day for it. - Yeah. Do you know of any good walking tracks around here? - There's, there's, plenty. Just pick one, have some fun. Just look out with the creepy crawlies. - (laughs) I'm actually like, I'm a country girl at heart. - Ah, huh. Ah, it's nice to see grace out. - Yeah, come say hi. She would love it. - Erm, no, no, uh, too much to do here. - Are you, are you sure? - Yep. - Oh, okay. Um, well, I'll see you later, Albert. - Yep. (bird chirping) (leaves rustling) - There you go. I'm gonna pop out for a couple of hours, okay? I'm gonna go exploring. I'll tell you what, I'll take some good photos for you. How's that? (keys jingle) (floorboard creaks) (calm music) (insects chirping) (calm relaxing music) (birds chirping) (calm relaxing music continues) (birds chirping) (camera whirring) (camera shutter clicks) (camera whirring) (calm relaxing music continues) (birds chirping) (branch snaps) (dramatic music) (birds squawking) (insects chirping) Hello?

Actually I did. I saw, I saw a couple of wallabies, which was pretty cool. - Ah, little buggers eat my flowers. - (laughs) I'll keep an eye on them for you, okay? - You do that. You want some firewood? - No, no, actually I'm thinking, I'm thinking we're good. I think there's some in the house already. - Okay. - Grace probably is waiting for me. (Albert sighs) I need to put her to bed. - [Albert] Right. - See you later. - Do, do the bed thing. (wood thuds) (ax thuds) (calm music) (match crackles) (calm music continues) (fire crackling) (calm music continues) (gentle suspenseful music) (object thumps) (suspenseful music) - Grace? (exhales sharply) (floorboards creaking) (suspenseful music) Grace? Grace? (dramatic suspenseful music) What? Grace? Grace? (suspenseful music) (door squeaks) Grace? Grace, this isn't... Oh my God. (suspenseful music) Shit. (spirit exhales ghostly) (insects chirping) Grace? (insects chirping) Grace? (suspenseful music) Grace? (floorboards creaking) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (door creaking) (suspenseful music continues) Grace? (door creaking continues) (door creaking continues) (suspenseful music) (door thuds) (spirit exhales ghostly) Grace? (door thudding) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) Grace? (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (ores rattling) Shit! Oh my God! (Sarah laughs) All right. (exhales sharply) Stop, stop, stop, all right. (dramatic music) Shit! Grace, Grace, what the hell? Oh, I've got you, I've got you, I've got you, it's okay. It's okay, I've got you. All right, all right. Don't worry, I've got you. Oh my God, let's get, let's get, let's get you back up there, come on, come on. I've got you. (gentle suspenseful music) (calm music) (birds chirping) (mouth trilling) (Sarah grunts) (gentle suspenseful music) (Sarah sighs) What's going on, Grace? (birds chirping) - (knocks) Albert? (door squeaks) Hey. - Yeah? - Something happened last night. Grace got out. (Albert laughs) - That's impossible. - I found her down by the jetty. How did she get there? - Well, if you found her down by the jetty, why didn't you come and get me? - I panicked. I really, really need this job and I can't afford to screw it up. - Look, (birds chirping) it's a lonely place, I get it, it can play tricks on your mind. - Yeah, but this was real, Albert. I had to carry her up from the jetty myself. - Look, why don't you go back to the cottage? Put your feet up, relax. - Look, it's like you're not even listening to me. - I, I'll check on you later. (door squeaking) (calm music) (water burbling) (bird chirping) (Sarah exhales sharply) (calm music) - It says that you've been at your previous position for three months, correct? - That's right, yeah. - So why did you leave? - Well, the previous patient, Martha, Mrs. Willis, she passed away unexpectedly. - I see. (sighs) Now, Grace needs 24-hour care. This is not a vacation. - I understand. - You do know this is a homestay? You'll be away for weeks at a time, no visitors permitted. At all. - That's fine. The longer, the better. - Well, Grace can be a very difficult patient. It's long hours and low pay. - I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I really want this job. - Do you scare easily? (gentle suspenseful music) - I'm sorry? - This house is very isolated. And many of our past carers have only lasted a week or two at the most. (phone ringing) Excuse me. (gentle suspenseful music) Hello? Yes. That's where I stand. (gentle suspenseful music) (Ms. Palmer chattering) I said no! (Ms. Palmer chattering faintly) I don't care what you've got to do, you sort it out now. All right, yes. (Ms. Palmer chattering faintly) (gentle suspenseful music) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (gentle suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (dramatic music) - I was just- - We can't afford to be looking for carers every other week. - It wouldn't be a problem. I wouldn't let you down. - (exhales sharply) Very well then. You start Monday. (insects chirping) (camera shutter clicking) - Shit, Albert! (laughs) - I'm heading to the waterfall after breakfast. Get some shots, fancy coming along? - Yeah, yeah, actually, actually that would be amazing. - Good. - I'll sort out Grace first though. - All right, you, err, do that and I'll see you up top. (insects chirping) (bird chirping) Ah, it's the water, she's terrified of it. That's why she's never left the island. - Where we're going, is that where it happened? - Nah, that was down the coast. She, err, spent a few weeks in hospital. Then the family moved her out here. - Surely it would have made more sense to keep her closer by? - Err, you'd think so, but they just moved her out here and then they forgot about her. - That's so sad. - Yeah, they're just waiting for her to die so they can come in here, claim the inheritance. - What'll happen to you? - I'll get by, (chuckles) always do. (calm music) (waterfall roaring) Come on. (waterfall roaring) Here we are. - Oh my goodness. That's stunning. (camera shutter clicks) (camera whirring) Kinda sad Grace can't see this though. - Ah, this would push her over the edge. Pardon then pun. (chuckles) Well, she's not a well woman. She's fragile, it, it wouldn't work. - You know, I'm doing the best I can for her. - [Albert] Ah. - It's just no kind of life that she's living. Old age is just so sad, the way your body kinda decays and crumbles all around you, I guess. I actually think we'd all be better off dying when we're younger. - Good lord, lighten up, will ya? You've got your whole life ahead of you. - You know, I've seen some things. I didn't have the best childhood when I was growing up. Dementia can be cruel. And it can make the people who suffer from it even more cruel. Evil even. Sometimes death comes as a relief. - Well, you know what they say, can't choose your family, but you can choose your friends. (upbeat blues music) - Where is she? Granddad wants a kiss. Sarah. (exhales sharply) - Slow down, love, that whiskey breath alone could kill her. You'll get your special time. (Sarah breathing heavily) (upbeat blues music continues) (door creaking) (Sarah breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - Love, did you check the shed? - [Grandma] No, not yet. - Oh, yeah, might just check it myself. Won't be long. (suspenseful music continues) (Sarah breathing heavily) Boo! (Sarah screams) (dramatic music) (Sarah screaming) (suspenseful music) (Sarah breathing heavily) (waterfall roaring) - Got all your shots? Yeah. You know what? I'm actually, I'm, I'm almost outta of film anyway. - Err, okay then, let's... - Yeah. - Follow me. (actor chattering faintly) (actors laughing) - Hey, hey, look, your favorite show. Here you go. (actors laughing) Dinner won't be long now. I hope you're hungry? (suspenseful music) (smoke alarm beeping) Oh, shit. (Sarah coughing) (smoke alarm beeping) (Sarah grunting) (Sarah coughing) Shit. (sighs) (kettle clicks) (dramatic music) Ah, great! (exhales sharply) Shit. (objects rattling) (torch button clicks) (gentle suspenseful music) Grace? (suspenseful music) Grace, I'm thinking it's a fuse. I'm gonna go get Albert, okay? (footsteps plodding) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (knocking on door) Albert? (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) Albert? Albert? (suspenseful music continues) Albert?

(suspenseful music) Oh, shit. - Hi. - The power, the power's out, I... - Oh. Fuse, they do that, you know? - Yeah, that's, that's actually, that's exactly what I thought it was. (knuckles click) - Well, we'd better go and fix it then. (Albert exhales sharply) (lid squeaks) (suspenseful music) Here you go. (dramatic suspenseful music) (switch clicks) - Thanks. I was in the middle of making dinner. - Well, if it happens again, just call me. - Will do. (insects chirping) (lid clanks) (dramatic suspenseful music) (door creaking) (actors laughing) (TV chattering faintly) (actors laughing) - Two Shot Tony. He's a bit of a, I wanna say mob boss, but that might be giving the creep too much credit. How'd you get caught up with him anyways? (TV chattering faintly) (Sarah gags) (dramatic suspenseful music) (TV chattering faintly) (Sarah gagging) (Sarah coughing) (suspenseful music) (Sarah breathing heavily) (Sarah coughing) (Sarah breathing heavily) (TV chattering faintly) (Sarah gagging) (Sarah coughs) (Sarah breathing heavily) (Sarah gagging) (suspenseful music continues) (Sarah breathing heavily) (Sarah retching) (dramatic suspenseful music) (Sarah breathing heavily) (Sarah retching) (Sarah breathing heavily) (Sarah breathing raggedly) (Sarah whimpering) (dramatic suspenseful music continues) (hair splatters) (TV chattering faintly) (suspenseful music) (camera shutter clicks) (camera whirring) (TV chattering faintly) (suspenseful music) (Sarah exhaling sharply) (dramatic suspenseful music) (Sarah exhales sharply) - One hour! (upbeat music) (Sarah gulping) It's gonna be an interesting game, everyone. At least I'm gonna hit. (laughs) (Sarah breathing heavily) (object rattling) (suspenseful music) - Grace, is that you? (spirit exhaling ghostly) (suspenseful music continues) It's okay. (suspenseful music continues) (camera shutter clicking) (table thuds) (objects clattering) (camera whirring) Shit! (TV blaring) Oh my God. I'm so sorry, Grace. Grace. Grace. (actors laughing) I'm trying, I'm trying, it's not working. Oh my God, just turn off, turn off the fucking... (remote button clicks) (Sarah exhales sharply) Grace? (suspenseful music) (floorboards creaking) (suspenseful music continues) Grace, it's okay. (floorboards creaking) Grace?

(gentle suspenseful music) (phone clicks) - It's in and out. - Right. Listen, I'm gonna go into town, get a few things. You want anything? - No, we're, we're fine. - Well, I might be a while, so I'll probably see you tomorrow. (snickering) (insects chirping) (birds squawking) (upbeat music) - Here you go, Grace. (sighs) Goddammit, I forgot your water. I'll be back. (objects clattering) (bowl rattling) Grace, what the hell? (actors laughing) Fine, do without.

I heard a noise. I was just checking up on you and Grace. What photos? - What photos? You know exactly which photos, the ones I found in your cottage. - (sighs) Hang on. I can explain. - Oh, can you really? - Yeah. - What about the others then, the other photos of the carers? You're a pervert. No wonder they left. - Now, wait a minute. - No, you're done, creep. (gentle suspenseful music) I'm gonna tell the family all about this pervy little setup you've got going on here. - Uh-huh. - And I'm gonna get the police involved. You're finished. - You can't do that. This is everything I know. - Yeah, well, maybe you should have thought of that before. - Ha! - I'm gonna leave. I'm gonna, I'm done with this place. - You've seen her. (hand thuds) - Don't touch me. - Well, you can't make idol threats at me. Why don't you get dressed? I'm gonna go check on Grace.
