You know, our cows don't know the difference between your pellets and any others, but we... Oh, that's great. Thank you very much, that's nice. Goodbye and say hi to your wife. - You just come home from vacation and you're already tired? - Oui... - Yes? - Well, when I come to class I put myself in Spanish time and in Spain, it's siesta time. - Come On! - Do you want to swap families? - Whenever you want! Tired of my brothers. It's like living with a rugby team. - Each have their shitty faults. - Stop! And your mother. She's hot. - Hi, Mathilde. - Who is it? - How are you? - Yeah. - Who is it? - Gregory. - Don't tell me you slept with him? - Okay, I won't tell you. - And Kamel? - We broke up yesterday, before the math class. - And him? - After the math class.

Does your father use the cream I gave him? - Dad, you use the cream the doctor gave you? Hoo, Hoo! Do you use on the cream, yes or no? - No? - Why? - When I put it on, it's limpy. - I have a vagina on fire! Mushrooms everywhere! Do you not care? - I'll make you some good fried mushrooms. Stop! I'm sorry. - It's ok. He must use the cream or it will never go away. - You have to use the cream. It's super-important. - And no more sex... - How long? - 3 weeks. - What do you mean no way? Hold on! You're not animals! - They understood. And you, Paula? - I'm fine. - Your period? - Hmm... - I will give you little treats. - Still nothing. I'm not in a rush. Well... Goodbye. - Come on! It's fresh milk! Come and taste! - Hello. How's the tomme? How is it? - the tomme... - Yes, sorry. - I would like 2 small pieces. What's wrong with this woman? - It's called Work Sharing.

You know that in 3 months, there is an election. And with my team, we are going to focus a lot on the disabled. - Mr. MAYOR! HELLO! - Rossigneux. - YOU'RE STILL STANDING FOR ELECTION? - Yes, yes! Moreover, I said to Mr. and Mrs. Belier we will help the disabled like you! - GREAT! I VOTE FOR YOU! - It's nice. Thank you. - Excuse me. Mr. Mayor. My father asks if you can leave. We are working. - It is you who make us feel disabled. - No problem. We, too, we have work to do. See you soon! - See you soon! Good day. - They are everywhere, everywhere... - Have a good day. - Obama is so cute! Who gave him that name? - My father did. Come On. - Will you give him to me? - You're crazy! - Why? - You can't get attached. Within 3 months, he is sold. 2 days later he's on your plate. - Oh. Yeah, I understand. - I love you, girl! - Well not me. - Bitch! - They must be having so much fun at Karen's. She probably has on an amazing dress. - A bitchy dress, yes! - She's going to excite all the guys. You saw Gaspard today? He irritates me! - Gabriel must also be excited over her. That idiot! - What do you see in him? - I don't know. I have bad taste, I guess. - How do you say "little asshole" in sign language? - little. - little. - asshole. The "ass", the "hole", being your head. That suits him, no? - Very good. - They are starting again! - Oh no! - This is not the time! - Next. - Arise children of the Fatherland. The day of glory has arrived - Oh boy.. The day of glory hasn't arrived yet! Shush! We will see more! Shush! Next! You with the glasses.

Your Turn. - I pass. - Push the pelvic forward because we can't hear a word from you. - I don't want to sing. - And why is that? - No thank you, it's for losers. - Excuse-me? - No thank you, it's for losers. - Alto, perfect. Leave! - But I... - Leave! - Hey, losers. ...and the incumbent Mayor, Mr. Lapidus, launches a new project for industrial zones. - The Mayor is on TV. Come translate. - Why this choice on Hubert's site? - Well. In order to attract companies to settle near production sites. Hubert seems ideally located. - But, those are forested lands! - According to our forecasts, hundred jobs could be created, in the coming years. This is a new era. I want to say: GO, Lassay! - He wants to take the agricultural land, that's crazy! - And the forest. There is the mall too. - I'm going to defend myself, me. He'll see! - What are you going to do? Stand for election? No, but you're kidding? - Together we can beat him. - A coalition, the four of us? - The Belier family! - You're the greatest, Dad! - What's going on? - Nothing. There is nothing. - Yes, I see. - It's just that... This election thing... I don't know if it's a good idea. - Why? Because I'm deaf? This is not a handicap to be deaf. It is an identity. - It is not very practical for a politician - And Obama, then? He is black. - No correlation! - Was it not a handicap to become President? - Yeah... - The family... - Hello. - Hello. - We come to apply. - Of course. That's it. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - WELCOME Mr. Belier. - Hello. - What do you mean, who am I? I've worked with the greatest French singers! For 10 years this fucking rector has refused to let me go to Paris and I am dying in the middle of nowhere with bumpkins who think that Gerard Lenorman is from Normandy! And if you... What? No, I want to talk to the rector. It's too much to ask? Pull your fingers out of your ass and pass him to me! Hello? Hello? - Damn. he must be all alone, Thomasson. - Do you want to volunteer this summer? Or try to find a job where we can make money? - Why not. do you have a snack? - I have a Snickers. - No, they're disgusting. - My, God! - Noo... - I'm not here! - It's whatever... - Let's go. - No. - Come! Let's go! - Stop! - Well then? So the juniors are not briefing the newbies? Go, into class. - I hate my life. - Good luck. - Come on, sheep. - Hello sir. - Hello. So. I have been criticized for two years trying to make a choir sing with broken voices. Except four or five and the Parisian, Gabriel Chevignon, This a No Man's land! Anyway I'm being punished for I- don't-know-what-I-did in a previous life. We will challenge fate and tackle a monument. - Michel Sardou... - We will work on Michel Sardou's repertory until the end of this year. Yes! Yes! When things go wrong, and there is no hope, Michel Sardou is the solution. - Can't we try something different? - Why? He's not good enough for you? - There are more modern composers. - Modern? Michel Sardou is to the French variety, what Mozart is to the classics: Timeless. Begin. She runs, she runs The plague of love In the heart of the children From 7 to 77 years old She sings, she sings The Insolent River settling in its bed Blonde hair, gray hair... - What's going on? We've lost you. I hear nothing, I feel nothing. You do not breathe. Nothing happens! The technique... I do not care! You, the new girl. Come here. - Me? - Yes. Sit down. The ventral breathing, you've heard about it? - No. - No? Spread your feet. That's it. Plant the sacrum. Press the pelvic forward. Open your ribs. Open. That's it. Breathe. Again. You feel your diaphragm moving? - Yes. - Good. Concentrate and repeat after me. Ready? - She runs, she runs The disease of love - It's not your voice. - hmmm, yes. - No, it's not your voice. Do what I do. - Relax the shoulders. That's it. Let go. - No eyes. Straight ahead. - Yes, it's starting to come! - Open. it's coming. - Excuse me. - It was about time! - Your lap belt. Open. Wide. Don't sing from the mouth. What's your name again? - Paula Belier - Paula Belier Paula Belier, you are a fucking soprano. - Of course. - Take it as you want. But, there is someone waking up inside of you. Paula Belier! Come here. Come. Would you be up for doing a duet? - Hmmm... 393.5 - Yes. - Very good. Learn this song by heart. Play it out. - What is it, "I'll love you"? - "I will love you." What is it? A monument. Thank you, Miss Belier. Gabriel, let's get back to work. Think about what I said. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Thank you. Good day. Yeah, this is good. It's very bold. Yes, no... it's great! Between the two, who do I choose? I'm not voting. - AH, MR BELIER! So, is it moving forward this campaign? A beautiful poster! - Cheese, Mr. Mayor? - No, thank you. No thank you. I congratulate your father. - He congratulates you. - What a little shit! - What... - He thanks you. - How nice. Me too. - I'll smash you. - What?... - He asks if you are ok. - Yes. I am delighted to have such an opponent. The victory will be even greater. - I'll kick the legs from under you. - I'll take some cheese. - Yes. - Not too strong. - Of course. - Say. Does your father truly think that people will vote for a deaf person? - Why not. They have already voted for an ass. - That's very elegant, miss. It promises a high-level campaign. Forget the cheese. - Yeah... - Over there. Good... Come on! - I told him you were going to cream him. - What you have stated about schools and housing, will bring you the votes. - Rudolph, you have no chance. Although no one supports Lapidus, you'll still lose. - You do not know his story. Telling him "it's impossible" only motivates him more. When he wanted to take over this farm. I told him "impossible". We lived in Fresnes. When he told my parents about it, they also said "impossible". When he has an idea in his mind, you'd better be behind him and not in front- I support him. I will vote for him. - I'll vote for him. - Yes, we need to support him. - But, during the campaign, Lapidus will buy votes with grants. We are honest, but so what? - Folks, I believe it's possible. I have the desire and the ability. Although I have 1 chance in 1000, I will try very hard. I'll decide my own fate. - That's good. Perfect. "The Plague of Love" speaks of love with a capital "L". And I don't hear an ounce of love in your voices. it's never happened to you? You don't know those shudders that twist the guts? It has to come out, so it drains, otherwise it will rot and you'll all die of colon cancer. The song is your manure pit. So feel it, damn it! With your guts! Well. You're excused. You learned the song? - Yes. - Yes. - Very good. So ready? 3, 4... - Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale - Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush - What is happening? Okay, here's what we'll do. start again but dancing. - Dancing? - Yes. - But what? - Slow Dance. Come closer. A technique of Stone and Charden. I remember in '76, during the heat wave... get closer. Come on. Get close. That's it. And sing. - Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale - Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush - Nananana... It's a song about desire, about passion. I want to lust! Get me hard! Ok, get out. - You are in a contest? - Radio France Contest. - What is it? - A singing school in Paris. In four months, I get out of here. - Why did you come here? - My father can not keep me. I'm with my grandmother. - Where is your mother? - I don't know. I gotta go. - Wait. And rehearsals? - Tonight. - OK. - Tonight 6pm. You're in the directory? - Yeah, OK. - "Yeah, OK. OK..." Why the fuck do I even talk - I'm fine. I wanted to say... A friend is coming over tonight. Yes, a boy. So no kidding around. Don't embarrass me. What do you mean, "finally"? You thought I was a lesbian? What's wrong with you? No! We didn't have sex. Can I trust you? You are scaring me. Okay, well... I'm a little queasy. This is not a date. Stop with that, Mom! - Hello. - It's you. Hi. - How are you? Is that your father outside? - Yeah. - He is a little weird. - A little wild. Let's go? - Yeah. Hello, ma'am. - Okay, well this is my room. - Cool, cool. - Let's get started? How do we do this? - You, there, and me here. - What about dancing? - Forget it. It's a little cheesy. - Yeah, it sucks. I prefer to be back to back. - Fine. - Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale - Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush - Enough to make the echoes cry out for mercy ENOUGH TO SHAKE THE WALLS OF JERICHO, I WILL LOVE YOU. Enough to make a hell burn in your eyes. - Enough to swear like all the thunders of God. - Enough to make your breast rise and all the saints... ENOUGH TO PRAY TO BEG WITH OUR HANDS. I WILL LOVE YOU. I WILL LOVE YOU, LIKE NO ONE EVER LOVED YOU. I'll love you beyond what your dreams could have imagined... Is something wrong? - No, It was good. It was great! Really great! - Really? - Yeah. Let's do it dancing? We'll have to anyway. - Well... Anyway... - Yeah. Well, well... - Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale - Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush Paula? - Paula? Where are you? - I'm here. - Are you ok? - Yeah, yeah! Can you do me a favor? - Sure. - Go get my mother. - OK. Excuse me! Paula is waiting for you upstairs. Seriously. She needs you. Oh damn. Sorry. EXCUSE ME. I DID NOT KNOW. Paula... Needs you. In the bathroom. Bathroom. - Thank you. Mom! - Mom, I'm bleeding! Ah! Stop it, Mom! This is not the time! Stop! - You slept with her? - What? Right... - Paula has her period! - Ah... - He's not upstairs? - Finally! Paula is a woman. - it's him? - Poor guy, it's not his fault. - How do you know? - They didn't have sex. I asked. - You ok, Gabriel? - What did I do? A tradition among the Jews? We are not Jewish. - Well, I'm going. - You do not want to... - Thank you. Bye. - Oh, shit! Being deaf does not excuse everything! You suck! - Did he see the stain? - I don't know. I want to be a mouse or some broccoli, but not me! - He is a guy. He won't figure it out. - I'm sure he didn't get it. He just came for a slow dance. - You're a woman. - Don't you start too. I didn't ask for anything. - Hey, Paula! Pistachio... You got a spot. Pistachio. - Are you done? - The bitch! Are you ok? - Mmm. Hey! You're a little asshole. You are shallow, you are nothing! Take your seats. - I'll explain. - There's a show in 3 months. Time to start working. I hear nothing. - YES! - There. Colon cancer. Remember. Your scores on the 2nd chorus. Stand up. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. - While doing jazz, Saturday on Broadway We dance on the sidewalks. - Come On. This is jazz! Come On! That's... - On the blowing waters. And we do not know at noon. - That's good. Let go! - If you are in Clichy - Broadway! - Or in California. While doing jazz Saturday on Broadway, as it swings in Meudon. We just go crazy, no need for Beaujolais, When we have some bourbon. This may not be true reality, it's the jazz of Broadway. Yes, but that's the one they like. - You have a gem in your throat. And your gem is angry. Would to like to learn to sing in Paris? - Me? - For 10 years my students have failed the contest, but with you and... Gabriel? Come. With you and Gabriel we have a good chance. The competition is in three months, after the show. - 3 months... - It's short, but you can do it. But, there's a lot of work. You have a gift. - And if I am accepted? - You will go to Paris, the opera, the best teachers... while continuing high school. So what? What do you think? What a dream, right? - No. - Wait. Paula... - Mathilde! - I'm coming! - Sorry, but... - No, everything is fine. Well, what's going on? Call you later. See you. It's amazing! - I can't go to Paris. - But why? - My parents... - Stop. They are deaf, not puppies. How did they survive before you were born? You want to do this school? - I think so. - You think or you're sure? - I'm sure. - So enter the competition. You'll see later. - Yeah, but... - Stop. This is good. You don't want to spend your life here, eating cheese? You got a gift. You realize? Damn, my best friend has a gift! - You're scared? - Mr. Thomasson? - Yes. Two seconds. What is it? - I'm OK for the contest. - Are you sure? - And you? - Sure. And your parents? - They are not against it. - Good, but it will not be "easy". Many are called, few are chosen. You will have to work. You are aware? - Yes. - Very good. See you every night at 6 pm including weekends, until the contest. We agree? - Yeah. - Very good. So, see you tonight. 13 chemin de la manufacture au Horps. Don't be late. - Yes. I've called you as soon as I could, Ms. Delton. The overdraft is quite normal. The cooperative has not paid us yet. What? I don't know. Ask them. Goodbye. Thank you, Ms. Delton. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hi. Don't say Hi! - Put it there, Paula. You can put your stuff there. You thought of a song? - Not really. - Here you go. - "I fly"? This is Gabriel's song. - Yes. Gabriel won't pass the contest this year. - Really? - No, he molted. - He molted? - Yes. He lost his voice. The rules are strict. A boy who molted can not apply to the contest. - Actually, I know... It's my fault. We had a fight... - No The world doesn't revolve around you. You will soon realize. - What do we do for the duet? - The choir? He can do that. Well, let's start. The song is not so easy. - Can we do "By Singing" instead? I know it better. - OK. If you want. - Thank you. - Good? Go. - When I was a little boy I was learning my lessons by Singing. And many years later I was chasing my dark thoughts by Singing. It is much less worrisome to talk about bad weather, by Singing. But it's so much more cute to be called an asshole - Although... - Through song - That's good. - Life is more fun and is less hopeless by Singing. The first girl in my life I followed down the street - Wow! - Singing. - Vote Belier! When she undressed, I played the old habit, Singing I was so pleased with me, that I made love 10 times, Singing. I can not explain that one morning she left me, Enchanted. - Love is more fun and is less hopeless, when Singing. - That's good. Breathe there. - All men go to the galleys in war or - in war... Sorry... - Go on. - Singing. The flower at gunpoint, the victory also won, by Singing. We do not talk to Jehovah, to Jupiter, to Buddha by singing, Whatever opinions, we make the revolution using Songs. The world is more fun... and less hopeless when singing... Oh! - Okay, okay. - Three mistakes... - It's the 1st time. We must start somewhere. It's not the competition. What do you think everyone else does? What is the task? - Uh... - What is it? We make mistakes, we fail, we go on. - We start again, then? - You're acting like Bella in Twilight. - Okay. - Tell your parents. You'll feel better. - Change the subject. - He didn't even notice us. Asshole... - I gotta go. - What? - You quit the choir? - Why does that matter to you? - And the competition? - I'm fine. Leave me alone. - I'm the one who should be angry at you - Alright. - For you! - You got what you wanted. - What are you talking about? - You're going to pass the contest! - That has nothing to do with this! Oh, I'm talking to you! Mom? I'm going. I'll be back for dinner. TV... It's not tomorrow? it changed? Should've warned me. At 6pm... I need to... My boyfriend... I can't do that to him! Come On! - You see him every night. - We had planned things. - I'm going to restyle you. You can't go on TV like that. - Yes, the TV. Great. Awesome... - This is beautiful. The light is beautiful. Uh it's good there? We will shoot footage on the farm for the interview. OK? Let's go. - Paula... It's every morning? - Yes. - You start with Gigi. Handheld, we follow. And then what happens? - Quentin and I go to school. My father works in the fields and my mother makes cheese. - Let's go. What is that, Paula? - Camembert and Brie. - Super. Want some? - Paula! Smile! Think of your beloved... Super! - He signs and I translate. - OK. - Super. Are you ready? Mr. Belier, you decided to stand for the municipal elections of Lassay. Why? - In recent years, businesses have closed. Our young people are leaving. There are no more doctors and the school is underfunded. You think what? I'm gonna let it happen? But, by coming all together, we will reinvigorate Lassay and give it a new life. - I want to give a new life to Lassay. - But you are deaf. Don't you think it is a handicap to be mayor of a village? - Absolutely not. being deaf has never stopped me from working, or living. Why would it prevent me from being mayor? - No. Not at all. - Are you translating everything? - Yeah, I translate everything. As usual. - Why does she make this face, then? - Your father is right. Something odd is happening. - I don't know why she makes that face. - Can we take it again? Can we? - Translate. - We will proceed differently. You will subtitle my answers. You will find someone to translate what I say. If you speak slowly, I'll read your lips. If we do not understand each other, you'll write. - Okay. - Thank you. You can go. - So, you... OK. Let's go on. Mr. Belier, you complain about Lapidus project... - Mr. Thomasson! It's me, Paula! Sir? Sir? - Are you kidding me? - It's not my fault. I was delayed. - It's not a self-service here! Go back home and question your commitment. - It's raining, please! Fuck! - To apologize to Dad? For what? For having a life? Ah, I'm exhausting you? - It's great to have a lover, but we are waiting for you. - I'm not in love. I have something important to tell you. No, I'm not pregnant. I'm auditioning for the Masters of Radio France. A Voice Academy in Paris. Mr. Thomasson, my singing teacher, thinks I can get it. Yeah, in Paris. No, I don't want to go to Paris. But the school is in Paris. Yes, I sing and I'm part of the choir of the school. For 3 months. Yes, 3 months or so. He didn't know about it. I was afraid you would think I was abandoning you. Oh, I'm a baby? Didn't you say I was a woman! I only had my period twice. Nice, thank you. For high school, I manage. I rehearse every evening at my teacher's. You understand what? The farm, the market, How to organize Dad's Campaign...? We must think about another solution. What about my brother? He's big, strong and I trust him. - What do you think? - Going to sleep? But dad! No, I'm not happy. - Can I have her room? - Our daughter wants to become a singer. Do you realize? - So what? She sings! - She is in danger. And it is not Hollande who will save her. Her teacher says that she has a beautiful voice. - Because you have heard her voice? - Very funny! - She just started. Maybe it'll pass. - Oh yeah? Imagine if she is accepted. All alone in Paris. - This is not what scares you. You're afraid that we are going to be all alone here. - You know that's my baby. - Your "baby", she menstruates, nevertheless! For the farm, take a clerk. We should have done it long ago. - It will be perfect! Thank you. No, I do not want to. That's enough! - With this finger. Cheese. - Ah OK. - There. You make a "c", the yogurt pot. - Yogurt. - Oh, you eat, actually. - Yeah, that's it. Well- never mind. The most important is to count. that's "euro". - Euro. - 1 euro, 2 euros, 3 euros... - 3 euros, 4 euros... Yeah. - Okay. That's it. What? He wants to teach you to sign. You think I'm an idiot? - That's not a bad idea. That way you can study your Spanish. - Good. OK. Touch a hair of my girlfriend I will kill you. - Thank you, Miss Belier, to honor me with your presence. Did you rehearse? - Yes. One question? Why is Gabriel not coming anymore? - Why? Don't you speak with him anymore? What do you think? He is depressed, unmotivated. Even in the shower, he is not singing. - Can we do anything? - I do not know. - For the choir, the duet? - He decided to stop. I'm not responsible. Yeah, what a mess. The duet, you will do it alone. Yeah, well... let's start? - Do I really have a gift? - Paula, doubt everything. Never me. Agree? - Yeah. How was it? Yes. Matilda, the market... Oh no, you sold nothing. No more sales, no more sex? What's the connection? Not because of me? It is not my fault! Mathilde, a disaster? Stop! Your face, what is it? Eczema. It is nerves? She is a beginner. Give her some time. She is intelligent. There! If it doesn't work, It's your fault. You make no effort. - I ride you? Oh no, I'm in love... - Am I interrupting you? - Oh, we are kidding. I have not been really good at the market. - Thanks, I'm aware of it. - Your brother continues to give me lessons. - Great! - OK... Well, I'm going. Bye, Quentin. See you tomorrow. I saw Stephane at the market. - You hooked up? - He told me that Gabriel had an accident. - And, is he okay? - Yes. He stole his grandmother's car and crashed on a roundabout. And he talked about you. And I didn't hook up with Stephane. - I'm sorry, that was dumb of me. Is it you who slept on the couch? Well... ok, bye! - We'll see each other this summer. - I am going. Have fun. - Bye. - What are you looking at? - Nothing, I'm looking at nothing. You're not going to class? - You understand quickly. - If not, are you ok? The accident? Who was just there? Your grandmother? - That was my father. Are you stupid or what? - It's not my fault if your voice molted. - What are you talking about? - Why did you stop singing in the the show? - Don't you do stupid things? - No. This is the first time I've missed class! - Your parents are interested in you. - Your father leaves you alone. - Or he doesn't give a crap. We can take the car and drive to Paris. - Of course! - You don't want to? - Really? Stop, we can't. - Why? you don't have the balls! - You're really a man.. With the your granny's car and you drive without a license. - So let's go? - Boy.. it sure will solve all your problems. - What are you doing? - Leaving. You're annoying me. Mom, I told you to knock! My sweater! It has shrunk! Yes, it has shrunk! Sorry, my ass! No it was not too big. I'm not small. To get me used to doing laundry? To live alone? I am not gone yet! Where are we? You're still upset. Which solution? But... Rossigneux will translate the meeting? I thought he was a shame to the deaf? - we learn to live without you. - I'm not dead! I'm here. I told you that I'd help you. Yes, I'm busy, but... - Test, test. One two. - My wife told you to make an effort on your outfit. - You do not like my stripes? It's my wedding suit. - I don't get it, I rehearsed all week. - I do not understand. Remember Mike Brant. He spoke no French. He didn't understand what he was singing. And suddenly, he was sublime! The problem is that you think too much. Try to be dumb. Huh? Yeah. Mike Brant. - The hearing! The hearing... The sight. The sight... The mouth. Taste? Yeah! Taste. - Thank you! Ah, hello! - Ah! Hello everyone. Yeah, welcome everyone. - Breasts? Nipples. Tits! OK. Rub? Uh... Scratch? itch? Hmm... How... Caress? Caress, OK. Caress, yes. - Come On! - It's part of my priorities. - You plan to do anything for my Internet connection? - Nothing. Your farm is 2 km from the highway. If you want Internet, you will have to move. - No one will vote for you! - He is right. Stop complaining! - OH! - Lapidus gave you the wrong habits. We talk about the community. It is written: "I hear you." This is not to listen to your bullshit. - It's crazy! - Belier, has lost! - What? It's hot? That's strange... Normally, it is not like that. What? it burns? I'll take it off. And... something's wrong with your color! Quentin? - We need to open up to the world. Open ourselves. - You are like plucked chickens. - Mathilde, not now! - Your brother fainted. He woke up. Yes, he is breathing! - You are disabled! - This is an anaphylactic shock. It's like an allergic reaction. - Quentin has an allergy. Allergy to what? - To latex, I guess. Goodbye. - How much do we owe you? - Don't worry about it. - Thank you. Could you give her a ride? - Of course. - I can not take more of your Mathilde. - Don't say "assholes." These are your voters. We're the assholes? We didn't abandon you. Quentin had an allergic reaction. He is asleep now. It's fine. Mom? Pff... Mom, what do you do? Mom, you can't do this! Let go. - I have not been a good mother to you. I tried to convey to you the family values. But it could not work between us. I am deaf. It's my fault. I failed everything. - You're not a bad mother. You're the perfect mother! - Why do you want to go to Paris? - Mom! - It was for me to go with you to the end. What did I miss? - On the contrary! It is thanks to you and Dad that I managed to make that choice. You gave me the keys. - At your birth, when I knew you were with hearing... Do you remember? I cried so much! I could never bear that you could hear! Your father comforted me. He told me: "Do not worry. "She will be deaf in her head. "We will raise her as a deaf. "With any luck, she won't hear anything!" And now you sing? All that's left is for you to be allergic to cow's milk! - Okay! I have to sell cheese all my life because I don't have the privelege of being deaf? That's what you see when you look at me? And you don't say anything? - What for? All right, go. we will be very well the two of us. - Paula? We had no appointment. Did we? Well, come in. - I quit. - Hm, what? - I can not pass the competition in Paris. - Ah. Why is this? - It's not for me. - Oh! I understand. All great artists have that. Nicoletta before a concert, she was in a state... - I'm not a great artist. - No, it's true. You're a little shit. - Yeah, Maybe. I quit. That's it. - No, no. That's not all there is to it. You think you're quitting, but you're digging a hole. You lie down in it and cover it back up. I know this well, this hole. I am in the same cemetery. - And then? I do what I want. This is my life. - Are you sure it is your life? - Yes. - Think. Please. - I'm through. Lou Lou, Obama! Come On! Come On. - Let's go for a ride? - Where? Hairdresser? Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. - Mathilde, can you check me? - Can I sit? My grandmother sold her car. - Great. - Are you speaking in code? - I went back to the choir. - Since when? - Since a girl shouted at me like shit. And besides, then she left. You okay? - No. - You wanna take up the duet? - Seriously! - Stop! Leave us alone. Thomasson did not tell you? - He did, you're not entering the contest. - I have nothing to do in Paris. - Yeah, attend a contest in Paris, it's stupid. You're right. Our duet is not in Paris. So... - No. Thomasson wouldn't want that. - He is the one sending me. So what? - Yes! Yes! - No. What do you think? - It could be great. - OK. But we rehearse at your place. - OK. - Damn! You are not simple. Well, I'm leaving. - Wait. - I don't have time. - No time? Mathilde! Wait! - Mehdi! What a dumb ass! Your shirt is backwards. This is unforgivable in showbiz! Come On! - Are you stressed? - Nicoletta. - It will go well. - Good evening everyone. Welcome. What a privilege... - We are waiting for you. - Ok... - How do you feel? - Uh... Wonderful! As usual. Uh... Come on. It's Showtime. - Showtime! - Showtime! Good evening! Good evening, good evening. Good evening. Thank you. Tonight, you have the opportunity and privilege to hear the most famous songs of the great Michel Sardou. Thank you. The kids worked hard. They are here for you. Welcome them. The choir! Doing jazz Saturday on Broadway It swings like in Meudon. We just go crazy, no need for Beaujolais, when we have Bourbon. It may not be true reality, the jazz on Broadway. Yes, but it's what we like doing jazz Saturday on Broadway It swings like in Meudon We just go crazy, there will no need for Beaujolais, when we have Bourbon This may not be true reality the jazz on Broadway Yes, but it's what we like AH! She runs, she runs the plague of love. In the heart of the children from 7 to 77 years old. She sings, she sings The insolent river Uniting in its bed, blond hair and gray hair. She makes men sing and expands the world. She sometimes suffers throughout a lifetime. She makes women cry, she is screaming in the background. But, the most painful is when it heals. All men go to the galleys for fishing or for war. Singing. The flower at gunpoint, the victory also won. Singing. We do not talk to Jehovah, to Jupiter, to Buddha... By singing. Whatever our opinions, we make the revolution. Using Song. The world is more fun, it's less hopeless by Singing. - Thank you. Thank you for them. Before leaving us, we have one last surprise. Paula Belier and Gabriel Chevignon are going to sing to you. "I will love you." They are changing, but they should be here. Here they are. - She is beautiful. - Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale. - Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush. - Enough to make the echoes cry for mercy... - BRAVO! - We nailed it! - Yeah! - Well, uh... see you later. - It was beautiful, I am proud. - Paula! - It was beautiful. - Thank you. - You know we can attend the contest. - But... - The audition is at 10 am tomorrow. Good evening. Yes, good evening. Your daughter has an exceptional voice. But instead of helping, you are holding her back. - He thanks you. - Thank you. The show was beautiful. The costumes, the lights, it was impressive. Congratulations. Yes, congratulations. Same. Goodbye. - I need some air. I will turn off the lights. Good night. - I'm listening. The song? It is the story of a man and woman who love each other like never before. Here, now? Enough to make all the "Marquis de Sade" turn pale Enough to make the whores of the harbor blush Enough to make the echoes cry for mercy Enough to shake the walls of Jericho I will love you. Enough to make a hell burn in your eyes. Enough to swear like all the thunder of God Enough to raise your breasts and all the saints. Enough to pray, to beg with our hands our hands. I will love you. I will love you, like nobody ever loved you. I will love you beyond what your dreams ever imagined. I will love you. I will love you. I will love you like nobody has dared to love you. I will love you as much as I would have loved to be loved. I will love you. I will love you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What's going on? At 10 am, but how do you know? We're going to Paris? Yes. I want to sing. - M. Thomasson! M. Thomasson! Thomasson? - What? What's going on? - You have a car? - No. - And that Peugeot? - Well... It's a Spanish friend who slept here. So she left her car, if anyone- if I need it... You couldn't have just said so! - Hello, I'm here for the audition. Paula Belier. - You are very late. Paula Belier... Alright. Go ahead. Parents, go upstairs. Right door. - Thank you! - Hello. - Hello. Sit here if you want. - Can I watch? - Yes. - Wow! - Your parents are over there. - All the way here, flamenco! - Yeah. I wasn't familiar, but I like it. Spain, it breathes. Come! - You have to wait a little. - Okay. - Tell the next one to come. - OK. Let's go? - Hmm... Yeah. Hello. - Hello. You are? - Paula Belier. - Paula Belier. What are you singing? - "I Fly" by Michel Sardou. - What? - "I Fly" by Michel Sardou. - You have the music score? - Me? No. - Michael, do you know it? - Yes, but without a score... - Try to sing it a cappella. - A cappella? - We're listening. - Excuse me. Sorry. I can play it. I know the melody. - You are? - Fabien Thomasson, singing instructor. - Thank you. - Good, we've lost enough time. Go for it. My dear parents, I'm leaving I love you, but I'm leaving... - Sorry. Excuse me. It is the emotion. I'm sorry. What are you doing? Close your eyes. Fly away. I will restart from the beginning. Sorry. When you want, princess. - My dear parents, I'm leaving I love you, but I'm leaving You'll no longer have children, tonight I'm not fleeing, I'm flying Understand well, I'm flying Without smoking, without drinking I fly, I fly. She watched me yesterday Anxious, confused, my mother; Almost as if she felt it In fact, she suspected Heard I said that I was fine So she didn't insist And my father, helpless smiles. To not look back To move a little further away From one train station to the next And finally, the sea My dear parents, I'm leaving I love you, but I'm leaving You'll no longer have children, tonight I'm not fleeing, I'm flying Understand well, I'm flying Without smoking, without drinking I fly I fly I wonder, on my way If my parents suspect That my tears washed away My promises and my desire to move forward Only believe in my life See what I promised myself Why where and how in this train That gets further away every moment It's weird, this cage That is blocking my chest I can not breathe it prevents me from singing My dear parents, I'm leaving I love you, but I'm leaving You have no more children tonight I'm not fleeing, I'm flying Understand well, I'm flying Without smoking, without drinking I fly I fly I fly I fly - Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! - Thank you. We will call you back. - Bravo! Bravo! - Miss? Very good choice. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Good bye, Sir. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. - Thank you. - Oh, it was not... Yes... No... Do not do that! No, no... - Thank you. Thank's a lot. - I don't understand anything. Come on! - Stop please. - Go, with our love.
