[sexy music] - Holy sá*át! You're on fire, girl. - Nothing wrong with throwing a little flame under your dinner. A girl's gotta have something hot to eat every now and then, right? - Whatever you say. Whoa! - [Hannah] Sorry. - It's okay. I like it a little rough. Ruff, ruff! This was new. Oh, fá*ák it! - Relax. It'll be easy. You taste so good. - Oh, yeah? Well, that's just the appetizer. Wait till you try the main course. - Why wait? - All you can eat buffet, baby. Dig in. [Hannah growls] [man screams] [eerie music] - Hi! Welcome to Southern California, a place where glamorous people try to fit in and be politically correct. And in a time where wearing fur and eating meat is so politically incorrect, we discover the Delta Delta Pies! This unique sorority, Delta Delta Pi, not only has embraced eating meat, but they have become like the Betty Crockers of butchering. The fastest selling, best tasting meat pies and quiches around. Don't listen to the cliches. [sniffs] Real men do eat quiche. - I love Delta Delta Pies. They taste great. - But don't take my word for it. Try one for yourself today! And remember. - [Group] I would just die for a Delta Delta Pie. - Thanks for watching. - Ladies, this is a very exciting time for us here at Delta Delta Pi. We are getting ready for a 20th anniversary homecoming celebration! [group cheers] And we were voted sorority house of the week this week on campus. [group cheers] And if that doesn't top it off, Specialty Meats Magazine did a big story on us. - Yay! - But unfortunately, during this time of celebration, we are faced with a dilemma. [bell rings] A cardinal rule of the sorority has been broken. Now if it was a sister, that would be one thing, but for my assistant, a former sister herself. [sighs] Hannah, tell the girls what you have done. - I ate of the flesh. - What flesh? - Don't. Please, Mother, I'm sorry. - Sorry is not good enough! What flesh? - Penis. - I can't hear you. - Penis. - I still can't hear you! - The penis! I ate the penis. [group gasps] - And why is that a sin? - [Group] Because the penis is filled with germs and sperm. - That's right, ladies. The penis is a filthy, repugnant part of the flesh. Cooked, it is barely passable. But raw, it is unclean. Yes, Clarice. - Mother, what shall happen to Hannah? - That's a very good question, my dear. On one hand, we have the guidebook that states that she should be banished forever to live among the common folk. But since Hannah's such a good soul, maybe she deserves a break, perhaps just a grounding. - Mother, forgive me, but we shouldn't set a precedent here. Grounding is not a severe enough punishment for such an infraction. I mean she ate a penis. That's unforgivable. - Patrice, I appreciate your concern but think about it. A grounding now will prevent her from participating in any homecoming activities, and that in itself is punishment enough. - Mother, no. Please, I've worked so hard. - Well, then we'll let the girls decide. What will it be, girls? Will it be a grounding or a banishment? - Banishment. - Grounding. - Grounding. - Definitely banishment. - It's tied, Mother. You decide. - Okay, a grounding. Hannah Bull, you are hereby grounded to the basement for a period of one month. You will not speak with a sister or exit the basement. - Yes, Mother. - Leave, now! Well, that was unpleasant, but without discipline, we have nothing. - Mother, but we must maintain the rules. - Well, we will. On to more pleasant things, homecoming. - Tell me again why we're here. - [Tobias] To spy on them. - They're wearing clothes. Isn't the point to see them naked? - No, you don't understand. - Yeah, apparently not. - Something really strange goes on inside this house. - Yeah, like two guys spying on fully clothed girls. - No. Like murder. - [chuckles] What? - Yes. Guys go into this house and they never come out. - That's bullsá*át. - No, it's not. I work in the dean's office. These reports come through all the time. - Yeah, then why haven't they been caught? - [Tobias] Not enough evidence, I guess. - So why are we here? - To find evidence. - What are we, the Hardy Boys? - Shh! - It's more like Cagney and Lacey. - I said shh! - Mandy and Simone, you'll be in charge of decorations and inviting the alumni. - Yes! I have some great ideas for banners. - Well, I can't wait to see what you do with that. - Clarice, Patrice, you're in charge of gathering supplies. - Yes! - [Marilyn] And we are low on most everything in the pantry, so don't be shy. - Yes, ma'am. - And also, don't forget to get only the finest of meats because we want to really impress the alumni. - You know you can count on us. - Jesus Christ. I'd rather watch paint dry. This is ridiculous. - [Tobias] You don't know what you're missing. Patrice isn't wearing any panties. - What? - I'm kidding. - Ha-ha. - No, seriously though, we've gotta find something. - They are planning a party. Quick, let's report it to the police. Come on, ooh. - Shh! - [Marilyn] And make sure they won't be missed. We can't take any more chances, girls. - [Sister] I'm sorry, Mother. The last one wasn't my fault. - fá*ák me! Did you hear that? - Yeah, what the fá*ák? - This just got interesting. - What do we do now? - Keep listening. - Okay, ladies, you know what to do. We don't have much time. Mandy, you're coming with me. I'm gonna give you some invitations and list of people to invite. - Yes, Mother. - Lucky bá*áá*hes. I wanted to do supplies. - She said we needed prime choice. I don't think you coulda handled that. - bá*áá*h. - cá*át. - Ladies, settle down. We all have our work to do. Let's just do it. - Have fun with your invites. [chuckles] - They're gone. - What do we do now, go to the police? - No, we're gonna need more. I'm gonna go back to my office, talk to the dean. Maybe he'll know what to do. - So what about me? - Well, be careful of the Pi girls. And whatever you do, do not go into this house. - Maybe I could come back later and see if I hear anything else. - Maybe, but be careful. Don't get caught. [eerie music] - Marilyn, please. - John, you don't have a choice. - I've covered for you up until now. What you're asking, I just don't know. - You need to relax, sweetheart. Now I know for a fact how many times you've helped out me and my girls. But you need to remember, we've helped you out too and you owe us, big time. - There's a limit to what I can do. My ability to protect you does not extend outside of this campus. - But it could, John. Think about it. With my help, mayor or governor is not out of reach for you. - [chuckles] Now that's very flattering but I don't know though. - Come on, John. Do this for me. - I'll do what I can, but please just stay clean. - Thanks, my dear friend. I knew I could cá*át on your. - Alright, thanks. And I'll keep you informed. - Thank you, Dean Wilkins. - You're welcome. - Oh, Toby, it's so nice to see you today. - Trouble, Ms. Fitch? - Well, nothing the dean and I can't handle ourselves. Good day, son. - You too, ma'am. Dean, I'm concerned. - What is it, Tobias? Well, it's about the Delta Delta Pis. There's something not right. - We've been over this before. Leave Ms. Fitch and her girls alone. - But dean-- - But nothing. You have been warned by me and by the police. How many times do you have to get caught harassing the DDPs before you learn? - But I think they're killing people. - What? - I think they're killing students. - Tobias, you just can't go around saying things like that. - I overheard them talking about the upcoming celebration. They were saying that they had to be careful. - Were you spying on them again? Tobias, you know they're gonna have you arrested. - Yeah, or killed. - What? Just stop this nonsense. What you need to do is concentrate on your job. - Dean, aren't you concerned? - Alright, I'll look into it, but you gotta stay away from the Delta Delta Pis. Let me handle this. - Yeah, but-- - Nothing. Listen to me. - Okay. - [John] Give me your word. - Alright! You have my word. I'll stay away from the DDP house. - Good. - Thank you, sir. - Oh, my god! Mandy, look at this! - [Mandy] What? - It's Mother Fitch when she was in school. - Oh, my god. Damn, she was quite a little hottie. Of course, she's had her boobs done since then. [laughs] - Are there any others of her? - [Mandy] Oh, here's one. - [Simone] Who's that? - Inseparable friends, Marilyn Fitch and Rhonda Cooper at one of their many successful bake sales. - Who's Rhonda Cooper? - I don't know. - Hey, we should invite her. What a surprise for Mother Fitch! - No, Mother Fitch doesn't like surprises. - Well, maybe I'll ask her then. Oh, here's another one. - Oh. Marilyn Fitch, Rhonda Cooper and John Wilkins pictured at the inauguration for the new Delta Delta Pi sorority chapter. - Is that Dean Wilkins? - That is him. - [chuckles] Oh, my god. He was kinda cute. - Oh, my god. [laughs] I bet you they were having three-ways with him. - Stop, you are a dirty girl. [laughs] - Two girls, one guy, do the math. [chuckles] - Maybe we'll ask Dean Wilkins about inviting Rhonda. - No, I told you, you should ask Mother Fitch first. - Alright, we'll ask her, but that takes all the fun out of the surprise. - So Mandy, how are the decorations going? - Oh, good, ma'am, but I've worked up quite a blister on my thumb. - Ooh, you poor thing. I hope that heals. Simone, what's up with the invitations? - Oh, good. We wanna invite Rhonda Cooper. - What? - Rhonda Cooper. You remember her, right? - Yes, but you cannot invite her. - Well, why not? She helped set up the sorority. She is a charter member. - And she happens to be the bá*áá*h from hell. She left the Delta Delta Pis, never to return! - But why? - Just leave it alone! Clarice, Patrice, what's the status on the party supplies? - Well, it's kind of like this-- - Mother, we haven't gotten anything yet. - You're kidding me, right? - Well, we've tried, but we're waiting for the right ones. - Yeah. - We are running out of time, girls! - We're gonna get some though. - You will get some tonight. - Tonight, we're gonna get some. [bluesy music] - There you go, bitch, one more. - Oh, you're so cheap. - Yeah. - [Terrence] Evening, ladies. What can I get you? - Let's go crazy. How about a diet Coke with a lemon? - You monster, you. And you? - I'm gonna have a screwdriver, Absolut, double shot. - Right, coming right up. - Them? - Of course, they're perfect. - Trudy, those uptown bá*áá*hes are moving in on our territory. - This is on. - There you go, ladies. - Thanks. - [Terrence] Sure. - How much? - Nada. Drinks are free. It's ladies' night. - Cheers! - [Terrence] You're welcome. - Oh, but Terrence, you're making a big assumption. Those bá*áá*hes ain't ladies. [Trixie and Trudy laugh] - Excuse me. - You heard her, bá*áá*h! - We didn't even do anything. What's your problem? - Look, girl. This bar is ours, okay? We don't need you coming in here, taking over our territory. - Uh, okay. We just came in for a fá*áá*ing drink. - Oh, yeah? - [Patrice] Yeah. - And people in hell want ice water. - You need to leave. - fá*ák you! [Trixie and Trudy gasp] - Huh-uh. You uptown, uptight, snooty sorority pussy bá*áá*hes! - Yeah, so? - You bá*áá*hes gotta go! - Obviously, we got off on the wrong foot. - Ya think? - Yeah. All we were trying to do is get you to leave nicely. Now we're gonna have to kick your slimy aá*áes. - Bring it on, ho! - [Patrice] Shut up. We don't fight! - No! - You're gonna get herpes or some sá*át. Come on. - No, it's too late for that. It's on. - You know what, fá*ák you, bá*áá*h! fá*áá*ing bring it! - Mind your own business! Come here, bá*áá*h! - fá*ák you! I'll shove my heel in your aá*á! - bá*áá*h! - [Steven] Hey, hey, ladies, come on, come on. - You fá*áá*ing wáá*áe! Later, putas! - bá*áá*h, báá*áh! Come here, bá*áá*h! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me. - Trudy, I'm wet. - Trixie. Oh, let's get your face put back on. - Here you go, T. - [Terrence] Later, guys. Stay out of trouble. - I'm getting too old for this sá*át. - Damn it! Now what are we gonna do? Mother Fitch won't be happy. - I have no fá*áá*ing idea. I just did not expect a bar fight. That's completely beneath me. - Maybe our luck is changing. - So you ladies okay? - Yes, thanks. - I mean you guys do know that we didn't do anything to those women in there. - I wouldn't worry about it. Those há*áá*árs were just drunk anyway. - Yeah, but there's no excise for the way they acted. - You're right. - Hmm, what's your name? - I'm Steven. This is Daniel. - Hey, Daniel. I'm Patrice, and that's Clarice. - So are you guys going back in there? - No, we were, we were finished. - Really? Well, uh, you guys wanna come and have a drink with us? - Yeah, sure. - Sounds good. - You can come back to our sorority house. - [scoffs] Really? Are you sure about that? - Of course. Our house mother's great. You'll love her. - Do you girls have beer? - Yes. - Then we're already there. - We'll follow you guys, huh. - Cool. - Come on. - Ugh. This sucks. Who's dealing? - I deal. - Just shuffle better than I did. - Please. - Good night, girls. Oh, I didn't know we had company. I'm kind of a mess. - No, not at all. Pardon us, ma'am. - That's quite alright. I'm Marilyn, house mother. - Hi, I'm Steven. Nice to meet you, Marilyn. - And I'm Daniel. - Very nice to meet you both. I hope my girls are being excellent hostesses. - You know we are, Mother. - That's my girls. Anyway, good night, kids. - Good night, ma'am. Sleep well. - Good night, Mother Fitch. - And if you need me, come and get me. Otherwise, I'm not gonna disturb your fun. Bye-bye. - She seems very nice. - Yeah. Never met a house mother quite like her before. - She's one of a kind alright. - Still my deal, right? - Yeah, this is boring. - Well, that's just because you're losing. - Huh. - Care to make the game a little more interesting? - What do you have in mind? - I don't know. How about we raise the stakes? Say to clothing? - Strip poker? - Strip poker. - Hell, yes, yes. Ante up, everybody. I'm gonna show you how this game is really played.

[phone rings] - Hello? Hello? sá*át. - [Recording] 4:29 a.m. - [Tobias] Hello, yes. This message is for Rhonda Cooper. Rhonda, my name is Tobias Haskell. I work for Dean Wilkins, John Wilkins. Please call me back when you get this message. It's very urgent that I speak with you. My cell number is 323-555-8825. The Delta Delta Pis are up to something for their 20th anniversary homecoming. Please, I really need you to call me back. Thanks. - [Recording] End of messages. - John, a dean, ha! [sighs] Marilyn. - Well, that's one for the yearbook. - Thanks, Scott. - Hey, don't mention it. See you guys after the break. - So Patrick, how do you know John? - Well, we met in high school. - Oh, so you're old friends then. - No, we didn't really hang out together. - Yeah, John was a book nerd and I was quarterback on the football team. - Ooh, mama likes. So do you have a nice tight end? - Give it a feel! - Oh, I will. Oh, my god. [giggles] Excuse us. We'll be in the back, fá*áá*ing. - [Rhonda] Hey, where are you guys going? - Nowhere. - Damn! - What? What's so funny? - Oh, nothing, Rhonda. Patrick here was just telling me how he likes to bend over and stick his hands in other guys' aá*áes. - What? - No. I was quarterback in high school. - [Rhonda] Oh, is that where you know John from? - Yeah, sort of. Actually, we just met up at Sweeney's pub last night. - [Rhonda] Oh. - I'm in town for spring break, and John said I can hang with you guys. So here I am. - [Marilyn] Oh, baby, you can hang with us if you're hung. - Somebody hose her down. - So, uh, what now? - Well, I gotta go back to my house and help my dad with some sá*át. - Hey, I have an idea. Why don't we go swimming tonight? My pool's heated. - Sure, that'll be great. - Oh, and don't worry about a suit. We like to swim naked. - Really? - Well, Marilyn does. - Alright, I'll see you tonight. How about eight? - Okay. I can't wait. - I have to run too. - [Rhonda] Alright, see you tonight too. - fá*ák me! That Patrick is so hot! - Yes, indeed. But I've got John, so you can have him. - Oh, thank you. You're so generous. - [Rhonda] You're welcome. So did you see Dean Thompson this morning? - Yes, he put me on probation. [Rhonda chuckles] "One more thing and I'll kick you out." - You're lucky he hasn't kicked you out already. - Oh, fá*ák him. Figuratively, of course. [Rhonda chuckles] He's a troll. - Yeah. Wanna get something to eat? - Yeah, I might as well. - [Rhonda] Alright. - Darling. - Let's go. [suspenseful music] - [John] One more beer for you. - Seriously, dude, you were a fá*áá*ing geek in school. - I love you too, man. - I'm only trying to help you. You need to loosen up. - Oh, son of a bitch, man! God! - Cowabunga, dudes. - John, put away the blowup dolls. The girls showed up after all. - [Marilyn] Ooh, this doll likes to bá*áw. - Excellent. - You stink. - Oh, hello to you too, honey. Dipsá*át over there poured beer on my head. - Wah, wah, wah. So rinse off then! - Thanks, dude. [Patrick laughs] - Oh, time for a swim. - Holy sá*át! I thought you said this pool was heated. - [Marilyn] Oh, here, I'll warm you. - [John] Don't be fooled, Marilyn. He's just gonna say his small dá*ák is cold. - Whatever. It's cold. Besides, you got on a suit, geek boy. - What the fá*ák! Get off me, fá*á! Get off. - [Patrick] You wish! - Come on, guys. - You fá*áá*er! That's not funny, man! fá*áá*er! - [Marilyn] Where'd he go? - There, he's in the deep end. - What's he doing? - Faking. He just wants sympathy. - He's not moving. Holy sá*át! He's, he's dead. - Joke's over, ha-ha. - She's not joking, John. - What? - Help me. God! Come here. - It was an accident. We were just playing. - [Marilyn] Shut up, John, and help me. Jesus! - [John] Does anybody know CPR? - I know mouth to mouth, but that's not gonna help right now. - We have to call 911. - No. - We have to! He'll die! - I can't have this on my record. - Your record? A guys just died in my pool. - You be quiet. I'll think of something. - That's right, Rhonda, no one saw us here. We can just leave. - Will you be serious? - Wake up, Patrick! - Oh, yeah, like that's gonna work. - Okay, I have to do something. - Please! I'll think of something. [suspenseful music] [phone rings] Hello? - [Tobias] Rhonda Cooper? - Yes, who's this? - [Tobias] Tobias Haskell. I work for Dean Wilkins, John Wilkins. - Oh, yes, I got your message. - [Tobias] Great. - So what's this urgent matter? - [Tobias] Well, the Delta Delta Pis, they're planning a 20th anniversary homecoming. - Yeah, so? I wasn't invited. - [Tobias] There's something strange going on. Guys on campus go missing. I think that Marilyn Fitch is kidnapping, or worse, killing them. - Go on. - [Tobias] And I think that Dean Wilkins is covering for her. - They must be stopped. - [Tobias] So you believe me? - Yes, I know it to be true. - [Tobias] Oh, thank god. Everyone else things I'm crazy. - But what can I do? - [Tobias] We could go to the police. Maybe they would believe you. - No, no police. We have to stop her ourselves. - [Tobias] So you'll help me? - Yes, this has gone on for too long. - [Tobias] What has? - Nothing. Later. Where are you? - [Tobias] Here on campus, but I have an apartment around the corner. - What's the address? - [Tobias] 3425 Maple Drive, apartment 217. My home number is 213-555-1238. - Great, I know where that is. - [Tobias] When can I expect you? - I'll be there tomorrow. I'll call first. Bye. - [Tobias] Okay, bye. [ominous music] - Andy, keep down, man. They'll see you. - Who? - The Pi girls. - Larry, what are we doing here? - I told you, okay, there's something strange going on here. They're killing people. - Huh? - Killing people. - For what? - I don't know. - Should we be here? - Yeah, we have to find more evidence for Tobias. - Yeah, well, he's at home in bed right now. - Which is where you boys should be. - sá*át, man. You scared me. - What the hell are you boys doing here anyway? - Perverts. - Panty raid? - You guys were spying on us, weren't you? - Yeah, we were. - Well, wouldn't it be easier to spy on us from the inside? - I'm not going in there. - Ah, would you rather go downtown with the police? - We didn't do anything wrong. - Shut up. Just come inside and don't make a scene. - No way! - Get your little aá*áes movin' now. - Oh, sá*át. [dog barks] Ha-ha. Okay, joke's over. - [Andy] Please, untie us. We won't tell anybody. - Help! Somebody, please! [girls giggle] - Real manly, dude. It's probably just some way to scare us. Let's just play along. - [Marilyn] Leave us. - [Andy] What? - Still think this is a joke? - [Andy] Yeah. - Hello, boys. - Okay, we've learned our lesson. - I haven't even started your lesson yet, sweet stuff. - [mumbles] bá*áá*h! [Hannah growls] - [Andy] Uh, ma'am. Uh, please, just let me go. You can keep Larry. - [Larry] Oh, thanks a lot, man. - Really? Is that your plan? Funny thing is I need you both. - [Andy] You need us for what? - [Marilyn] The celebration, of course. I have a present for you. - No, I didn't do anything! I swear! - [Andy] What are you doing? [Larry mumbles] - I can't have you waking my girls with your screams. - [Andy] What? - What do you mean what? Don't talk back to me. Shut your fá*áá*ing mouth! Act like the little schoolboy that you are. You wanna get a good grade in my class? Shut the fá*ák up, motherfá*áá*er. [Hannah pants] [Marilyn gasps] If it's any consolation at all, you won't be wasted. [moans] Oh, yes! [Larry mumbles] Oh, yes! Oh, look at this lovely piece of carpaccio. Yum. [Larry screams] - Mmm, smells delish. What is that? - Larry from last night. - Oh, my god. - Want a taste? - Ugh, I don't know. What if she comes up? - Shh, [mumbles]. - Oh, god. Mmm. Ugh, fá*ák! - [Clarice] What's cookin'? - Oh, just preparing for the celebration. - Yeah, how did you sleep? - Good, thanks. Where's Mandy? - She got up early and went shopping. - Wow, that's way early for her. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. She's a little mad. - Mad? Why? - She wanted to strip the meat last night. - What? - She and I caught these two guys out front. - Larry? - Yeah. We took them to the basement. We got all the preparations made. And then right as we were about to begin, Marilyn sent us away. - I know. It is total bullsá*át. It's like we do all the work, go out, get dressed up, and she gets all the fun. - Shh, she might hear us. - [Patrice] Anything? - [Clarice] No. - So Mandy went out and went shopping this morning. - That's so not cool. I know how she fells. - But girls, we know that's how things are done. - Alright, forget I said anything. - I will. - God, she is such a bá*áá*h sometimes! Oh, my god. [phone rings] - Hello? - [Rhonda] Tobias? - Yes. - [Rhonda] It's Rhonda. I didn't wake you, did I? - No, I was in the shower. - [Rhonda] Anyway, I'm in town, just got here. - Great. - [Rhonda] I thought we could meet for lunch. - Sure, sounds good. When and where? - [Rhonda] You tell me. This is your area. Nothing too public though. I can't risk being seen. - Okay, um, how about the park on Elm Street. I'll pick up some hotdogs. - [Rhonda] Okay, I know where that is. That'll be fine. Around noon? - Sure. - [Rhonda] See you then. - Okay, bye. Larry, it's Tobias. If you're there, pick up. Okay, listen. Call me. It's really important. I need to talk to you. Bye. Rhonda? - Tobias? - Oh, thank god you're here. - Are you alright? - No. I mean yes, but my friend is missing. - They won't stop! - My friend Larry, he got caught outside the DDP house last night. Marilyn says he's with the police, but they don't know anything about it. - [Rhonda] Your friend is dead. - What? - We have to move on. We need to make a plan. They must be stopped. - They? What goes on inside that house? - Tobias, what I'm going to tell you would be difficult to accept, but you must keep an open mind. - I'll try. What is it? - You see, the Delta Delta Pis are a sisterhood based on cannibalism. - [laughs] What? - Cannibals. They kill and eat human flesh. - Jesus Christ. - Not just that. They serve that flesh to others. - In their pies. - Yes. - fá*ák me! - Tobias, please focus. I need your head on straight. - What is your involvement in all this? - It's a complicated story. You see, Marilyn and I were best friends in college. We were always in trouble, and most of the time, short on cash. At that time, I was dating John Wilkins. - Dean Wilkins? - Yes. So anyway, one weekend over spring break, we were swimming with some friends when one of the guys was accidentally killed. We were frantic. We didn't know what to do. - What are we gonna do? - We can't tell anybody. I'll get kicked out of school. - Me too. - I don't know either. Can we just take the body to the dump? - No, people saw us together. If they find the body, they may link him to us. - Well, then what, dress him up and take him home to mommy? - No, be serious. - Then how do you suggest we hide the body? - We could chop him into pieces. - Then what? They can still find evidence, fingerprints or something. - We could cook him. - What? - We could cook him and eat him, and then there'd be no body to find. - Oh, come on. That's gnarly. We gotta come up with a real idea. - No, John, that would work. It sounds good. - You two are both disgusting. - No, you see, we chop up the body, and then we cook it in some sort of stew or pie. - Yeah, so we have a bake sale and then we sell 'em to people. And then we make money and get rid of the evidence. - Fabulous. - Have you both lost your minds? - Shut up, John. Do you have a better idea? - So how do we start? Chop up the body here or we take him with us? - We should probably take it with us. - Uh, yes, this is my house. Please don't chop up the body here. - Then why don't you help us load him into my car? - Holy sá*át! I can't believe I'm actually discussing this. - fá*ák you! You were the one who killed him. - What? - Yes Rhonda, maybe you and I should just leave. - Yeah, John. How would that look, finding a dead naked man in your house, hmm? - Hmm? So why don't you help us load him into my car? Now. - So we carried the body back to our apartment. - Oh, my god. - It was quite bloody, but it got easier after the first. - What? - [Rhonda] Yes. - But it was an accident. - The first was, yes. - Then how were there others? - I'm not proud of this but you should know everything. - It's okay. I'm sorry. Please go on. - Well, you see, to get rid of the body, we put the meat into various dishes for a bake sale to raise money. - Oh, god! - It was a huge success. We had requests for our quiches, meatloaves, sausages, but the pies were the most popular. Well, Patrick was gone after one day, and everyone was coming back for more. - That's terrible! - The money was great too. We'd never been in a situation like this. That's when we decided to kil someone else. - What? - Yeah, but we wanted to make it someone that no one would miss. So Marilyn found a homeless guy outside a bar downtown. She brought him home and we killed him. The problem though was that his meat wasn't nearly as tasty as the college jock's. The pies weren't good. The meat tasted sour. [Tobias gags] I can stop if that will help. - No. I'm okay. Please, go on. - Well, at the same time, Marilyn and I contacted the national chapter of Delta Delta Pi. They were somewhat interested in us setting up a chapter. But when they saw the bake sale and the money that came in, they were very excited. We were given a chapter, and soon, we became their favorites. - How many people did you murder? - We would lure athletes back to the house once a month. With two men, the meat supply would last the entire month, two bake sales. - How did Dean Wilkins deal with all of that? - At first, he wanted to go to the cops and confess about Patrick, but Marilyn convinced him otherwise. She gave him a cut of the money. - Didn't you ever get caught? - No. Actually, the DDP girls were highly revered on campus. The key to our success was to keep our grades up, contribute to charities, and always have an alibi for the killings. - Oh, sá*át. - I gotta get back to the office. - So now what? - The homecoming's this weekend. They have to be stopped. - Tonight. But I need your help. - What can I do? - I need you to get Marilyn away from the house. Divide and conquer. - Done. - Great. She should be gone for at least an hour. Can you do that? - Yeah, I have a plan. - Do not underestimate Marilyn. She's a crafty bá*áá*h with a deadly survival instinct. - Believe me, I know. [John grunts] - Oh, Jesus. You scared me. - Oh, Tobias. My mouse came unplugged. - Did you fix it? - Oh, yeah. So what can I do for you? - Nothing. Why? - You're in my office. - Oh, uh, I was gonna turn off your computer. I thought you were gone for the day. - Not yet, but thanks. - Okay. [ominous music] - [sighs] Look, Tobias, I know I've been a little hard on you lately, but you gotta understand. I see your potential, and I don't wanna see you get kicked out of school, or even worse, arrested for being a peeping Tom. - You're right. I won't. - Lock up when you leave, okay? I'm outta here. - I will, sir. Have a good night. Okay. Marilyn. Email address. Okay. That should do it. Okay. [whimsical music] - [Rhonda Voiceover] I can think of something. We could cook him and eat him, and then there'd be no body to find. We can cook him. - [Marilyn Voiceover] Fabulous. [suspenseful music] [Rhonda gasps] - Oh, god. - Rhonda? You okay? - Oh, yeah, just thinking. - Chin up. We're gonna kick some Delta Pi aá*á tonight. - Thank you for everything. - You're welcome. Rhonda? What happened? Why did you leave the sorority? - I felt guilty, I guess. When we graduated, I wanted to leave. Marilyn and John fought with me, but my mind was made up. I gave them my vow not to betray the sorority, and I left. - So you were redeemed. - [chuckles] Thanks, Tobias, but I don't believe that. What I did was wrong. I can't change that, but I can stop it from happening anymore. What about you? Did you arrange for Marilyn to be out of the house tonight? - Done. You should have at least an hour. - Thanks. Good luck. Be careful. - I will. You too. - [Mandy] Simone, come on. I want this to look right. - [Simone] Me too. - Then make 'em even. - Girls, I have to run out and run a quick errand. Make sure these decorations are done when I return. - Yes, Mother. - And keep an eye out for any meddlesome boys that might come spying on us. - [Simone] We will. - Okay, toodles. - See you later. - Bye. You heard her, Simone. We need to hurry. - Not my fault. - Damn it! - [Simone] What now? - I'm out of string. - [Simone] Hurry back. [suspenseful music] - [Rhonda] Excuse me. - Oh, my god! You scared me. You're a sister, right? - Used to be. - I knew it. Welcome back. I'm Simone. - Rhonda, Rhonda Cooper. - Oh, my! You're Rhonda Cooper! - Rhonda's come home. - Simone, we're out of string. I'm gonna have to run to the store. Simone, where are you? Fine, I'll go to the store by myself, lazy bá*áá*h. - Hi, my friend. - Marilyn, good to see you. What'll it be? - I'll have me a scotch on the rocks, my friend. - You got it. - Thanks. [sighs] Have you seen John around tonight? - No, I haven't seen him yet. - Hey, Trudy, Trixie, you girls see John around? - No, he ain't been here. - We should know. We've been here all night watching the door. - Yeah. - There you go. - Thank you. [suspenseful music] - Hello? Someone's in here. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, my god. Who are you? - I'm Rhonda. - Whatever. Get out! Are you some sort of lesbian? Get out! - My mistake. - fá*áá*in' freak! [Clarice screams] - Strike three, you're out. [doorbell rings] - [Patrice] Fine, I'll get it. Hi. Can I help you? - Is Mandy here? - And Simone? - Well, they should be outside. Did you guys look around? - I didn't see 'em. - [Patrice] [scoffs] Well, who are you? - I'm Nick, and this is Paul. - We have dates with them. - Cute. Come on in. Um, I don't know. Just go sit down on the couch. I'll go see if they're upstairs. Hey, don't touch anything. [rock music] - I don't have the fá*áá*in' time for this. Trudy, can I borrow your cellphone there? - Excuse me. - I'll give you a dollar. - Don't do it, girl. - Okay then, make it fast. This is my work phone. Hey, dollar. - John? Where are you? I'm at Sweeney's, waiting for you. You did? Well, I got your email. Hmm? He did what? Don't you worry about a thing. I'll take care of it. Just meet me at the house. It's time this little fá*áá*er gets it. Thanks. - Trouble? - Just a little fly in the soup. Hey, Terrence. - [Terrence] Yeah. - You still got that storage locker out back? - Mandy, Simone? fá*ák. Where the fá*ák are you guys? Hmm, hey. Glad you're not home after all. [suspenseful music] - What are you doing? - Who are you? - I'm Rhonda Cooper. And you? - Ha, I know you! What are you doing here? It's not even homecoming yet. - Delta Delta die, bá*áá*h! [screams] - Oh, hi, guys. I'm Marilyn, the house mother. - I'm Paul, uh, Mandy's date. - Nice to meet you. Thank you so much. This is gorgeous. And your name? - I'm Nick. I'm here for Simone. - It's a pleasure. Well, I think the girls are still upstairs getting dressed. So if you wanna have a seat and just relax, they'll be down shortly. - Thank you, ma'am. - It was nice meeting you. - Same. Oh, boys. - Yes, ma'am? - Can I get you to give me a hand? - What can we do? - Well, I have this rug in the back of my truck and it's really heavy. I'd like you to carry it into the basement for me. - [Paul] Sure. - Okay, come on. [ominous music] Okay, you guys. Just down the hallway, a little bit to the right. - Sure. - And when you're done, you get a reward. - Oh, that's not necessary. - Oh, yes, it is. Alright, guys, great. Just right there is perfect. [Tobias grunts] - Whoa, what was that? - Nothing. - No, it sounded like there was a person in there. - Come on, dude! Why would there be a body in the rug? Why don't you just come over here and get your reward I promised you? Check this out. You ever see tá*ás that look like this before? It's so hot. Huh, you like that? You want a piece of me? - Mother, Mother, Mother, can I come out now, you fá*áá*ing báá*áh? I ate the penis. I ate the penis. I ate the penis. It's filled with germs and sperm. It's filled with germs and sperm. It's filled with germs and sperm. Shut up! Shut up! - Look at you. - [screams] What the fá*ák! - Hey! Hey! You fá*áá*ing báá*áh! - Simone? I'm back. Hello? Hey, whose car is that out front? Simone? Simone? Oh, Simone, I'm back. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were my-- - No, it's just me. - Oh, I know who you are. - You do? - Oh, sá*át! - Take that, you little stool pigeon. You'll never tattle on anyone again! [grunts] I'll grind your balls to make my lunch. [suspenseful music] [knocking on door] - Go away, please! - What's the matter? I used to be a Pi girl too. [lamp shatters] - [Mandy] No! - Whoops. - [Mandy] No! No! [doorbell rings] - Hello, is anybody here? - John, where have you been? - Oh, Marilyn, you're not reedy yet. I thought I'd just wait inside. - Come on in. Boy, am I glad you're here. - So, what's going on? - Well, I took care of that little problem at the pub. - Good. - Now I can't find the girls. I've looked everywhere for them. - Well, they probably just went out. - Yeah, I hope you're right. - So, uh, how's homecoming going? - Very nicely. The decorations are almost complete, and we have two more sides of beef. - Oh. - [Marilyn] Almost stocked up. - Please, I don't wanna know the details. - Ah, I forgot. I'm sorry. Anyway, why don't you let me get dressed, and you make yourself at home. - Look, take your time, okay? I'm just gonna go out and have a smoke. - [Rhonda] Hello, John. - Jesus Christ! - Sorry. - Rhonda? It is you. - In the flesh. - So how you doing? - Come here, John. Give your old pookie bear a big hug. John, what's wrong? - Oh, nothing. This cigarette. It's great to see ya. - Good, I wasn't sure if you'd wanna see me or not. - [grunts] So what brings you here? - The homecoming. - Oh, yeah, yeah. But you're here a little early. - Well, I didn't get the formal invitation. - So how'd you know about it. - Tobias invited me. - Tobias? My Tobias? - [Rhonda] Yes, he seemed very concerned about the Delta Delta Pi homecoming. - That meddlesome little fá*ák! - You and Marilyn are being sloppy. No wonder he found out. Now I have to come here and clean up your mess. - What? - Look, I vowed not to betray the sisterhood, but I am not going down for your fá*ák-ups. - What do you want? - We must stop Marilyn. She's lost it. - She's upstairs. Quiet. - fá*ák her and fá*ák you! This has gone on too long. - Please. Just leave, now. I won't even tell her you were here. - And what about Tobias? - You keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Why do you think he works with me in the office? - He knows about you too. - What? - Your involvement. - You didn't. - I did. I told him everything. - Why? - He would have found out on his own. - No, he wouldn't have. - John, don't be stupid. Marilyn has to be stopped. Will you help me? - No! Absolutely not! Marilyn's my friend. - No, she's not. She's using you. - And you left me. - I had to get out. I'm sorry. - It's too late now. You really hurt me, and Marilyn was there for me. - John, if Marilyn gets caught, you are gonna go down and so am I. Is that what you want? - No, but why should I help you? - With your help, I can stop her. We can end this together. But I can't take on both of you. - Rhonda, I'm sorry. I just can't. I stand with Marilyn. - [Rhonda] Then you won't stand anymore. - What the fá*ák! [John grunts] [suspenseful music] - Mandy, Simone? Where are you girls? What is that? What the fá*ák. There's something very strange going on. I don't like it. Girls? John? Come on, John. gá*ádammit! Hello? Mandy? John? Simone? Come on, you guys. This isn't funny anymore. Where are you? Hello? Oh, my god! What happened to you girls? Who did this to you? - [Rhonda] Stop! - [Marilyn] John? - Hello, Marilyn. - Holy sá*át, Rhonda Cooper. - Good to see you too, sister. - You look awful. What happened to you? - I grew up and washed away my guilt. - [scoffs] What are you doing here? - It's homecoming, right? - Not for you. You're not a Pi girl anymore. You're a disgrace. - I paid my dues, and I'm still a sister. - Well, you're not welcome here, and you need to leave now. Why did you come, anyway? - To stop you. - Well, you wasted your time. Go home. - No, this ends tonight. - Who do you think you are? - Marilyn, you are the disgrace. This whole sorority has gotten sloppy. - What are you talking about? - I was contacted by a civilian, Tobias Haskell. He knows everything and will bring you down. - I've got things under control. Can't you see? Look around. - [scoffs] You're delusional. - Am I? - Yes. Now you have an option. You may leave peacefully on your own, or I will remove you myself. - You're the one who's delusional. - Marilyn, I called the Delta Delta Pi offices today. I told them of your ineptitude. - What? - Yes. They want your resignation immediately. - I'd rather fá*áá*ing die, you bá*áá*h. - That can be arranged. - You need to call those people back and tell them it was a mistake, like some kind of fá*áá*in' April Fools joke. - Why should I? - Because if you don't, your little fá*áá*át friend here gets it in the aá*á! - Go ahead. What's one more death in your hands? - What's that supposed to mean? - Marilyn, this fight is between you and me. Nothing else matters. - Well then, bring it on. - Die, bitch! - [Marilyn] fá*áá*ing traitor! I'll fá*áá*ing knock your teeth out, you gá*ádamn wá*áá*e! [suspenseful music] - Hey! [rock music] - You bá*áá*h! [Marilyn screams] Who do you think you're talking to now? Tell me the truth. Who do you love? - [Rhonda] fá*ák you, bá*áá*h! - [Marilyn] Eat my aá*á, wá*áá*e báá*áh! Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? fá*ák you, fá*ák you! You wá*áá*e! I'll fá*ák you! - You bá*áá*h! I'll fá*áá*ing kill you! You fá*áá*ing die! - Thank you. Who are you? - I'm the last face you'll ever see. - What? - Greetings, sisters. It's so nice to be back. - It's really great to have you back, Hannah. - Mother Hannah. And thank you. It's good to see Dean Wilkins is here and looking good. - It's just nice to be here, Hannah. Thank you. - Due to the unfortunate, uh, resignation and departure of Mother Marilyn, I'm hereby assuming control of this chapter of Delta Delta Pi. [group applauds] Thank you. You've all been very supportive of me thus far, and I look forward to the future here. Now let's eat. Clarice, please serve the meatloaf. - [Clarice] Yes, ma'am. - There will be a few changes here at the new Delta Delta Pi house. Dean Wilkins will continue to help the sisters and to cover for us on campus. - Yes, ma'am. - And we appreciate that. However, all of the sisters will need to pull their weight going forward. - Uh, what? - Yes. You girls will be allowed to strip the meat now. [group applauds] Yes. Mother Marilyn was always very selfish when it came to the fun part of the job. I wanna spread the wealth to all the sisters. Secondly, and this will be a big change for us here, we will start to use only female meat. - What? - Yes, yes. I've found that nice, firm female meat is far more appetizing and plentiful than male meat. It even tastes better. In fact, dig in. The meatloaf is a new recipe. We shouldn't let Marilyn go to waste. That wouldn't be respectful. [group laughs] [Hannah laughs] Ah. - Hello, SoCal State! As you know< I have always been an avid supporter of the Delta Delta Pi sorority bake sales. Those delicious pies and quiches have become quite the tradition here on campus. I like never thought there would be anything better. - What? - Yes, there is something better! - Better than Delta Delta Pies? - New and improved Delta Delta Pies! - Improved? - Yes! Those new pies and quiches have only top quality meat and ingredients. - Mmm, this is good. It melts in my mouth. - Yes, and the taste. - Oh, yeah. - Now more than ever, I would just die for Delta Delta Pie. ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Stand for us, our little angel ♪ ♪ Face so pretty, like a doll ♪ Pose For us, our pretty princess ♪ ♪ Ready or not, we'll have it all ♪ ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick, sick ♪ Walk for us, you frightened weakling ♪ ♪ The contents of your purse spills on the floor ♪ ♪ Plead in vain for us to save you ♪ ♪ Because every pretty girl wants to be a wá*áá*e ♪ ♪ Hush now baby, don't you cry ♪ No one's gonna save you, you're gonna die ♪ ♪ Hush now baby, don't you fear ♪ ♪ The time is short, the end is here ♪ ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ And that's what you will always be ♪ ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ And that's what you will always be ♪ ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ You're not gonna be sorry, girl ♪ ♪ Scream for us, my fallen angel ♪ ♪ Never thought you'd be so far from home ♪ ♪ Plead for us, you wretched creature ♪ ♪ As you lay down alone ♪ Hush little baby, don't you cry ♪ ♪ No one's gonna save you, you're gonna die ♪ ♪ Hush little baby, don't you fear ♪ ♪ The time is short, the end is here ♪ ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ This is what you will always be ♪ ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ You are the perfect victim ♪ This is what you will always be ♪ ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ You're not gonna be sorry, girl ♪ ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick ♪ Sick, sick, sick, sick
