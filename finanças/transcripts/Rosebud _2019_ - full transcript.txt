I'm her friend. Is she here? Is she hurt a lot? She's getting stitches. How did you know? She didn't come to the practice, so I went to the factory. Getting stitches without anesthetics. It must hurt. Why no anesthetics? Rose... she is pregnant. Pregnant? - That day? - That day? Are you the father? What? No, no. I didn't mean that. Calm down. Rose, are you OK? Yeah. Let's go.

We agreed on an abortion! Shit! This is not just about the money. I'm worried about you. Think about it. You worked day and night to get here. You are just one step away from success. You are going to give that all up breaking your own wings? That's not right. I'm sorry. I just can't give up my baby. I can't do it. Such a headache... - Mr. Kim. - Yes. - Mr. Kim!! - Yes. - Grab her. - Yes, ma'am. - What are you doing? - She's crazy. Let me go! You cannot force me? Let me go. - Stay still. - Don't touch me.

Why are you typing with one finger? I told you to learn to type, didn't I? Can you help me to find Hyuna? What? Hyuna. I need to know what she looks like. Does she have droopy eyes like her father? She has big eyes. Then, let's do this. Parents go that way. - Officer Kim, you follow me. - Yes, sir. Hyuna, hyuna! Rose. Hyuna. Yes, morn. Doesn't this look cool? How did you come here all alone? I knew you would come here. I'm so sorry. I will never leave your side. Let's be together always. I pray all alone. The time completely forgotten. Sometimes I think about that time. When I'm lonely, I think. Yes. We talked about that. We went there often. The place we spent time together. We can't go back to the past, but the memory remains. "1995" - Mom!! - Hmm? You wore this, didn't you? What? I told you not to wear my clothes. Why would I wear your clothes? I know you did. Then why did you wash it? You just left it on the floor. No, I didn't. It was in the drawer. I don't know. I need to go to work. Why did you wear mine? Fine, I did wear your clothes. I raised you over a decade. You can't even let me borrow your clothes?

You can't even take care of yourselves. Sorry. Please don't do this. Just take it. Why are you sorry? Buy some nice food for Youngmin. Cheer up. Yeah! Open up your shoulder. That hurts. Don't worry and go back in. Cheer up. What what what? What was that? So when did you start dating? We are not dating. I just have his beeper number. Why do you get all the hot guys.

One for you. - One for you. - This tastes good. Isn't that Hyuna? HEY-Hyuna! Some daughter you got. How can she ignore her mother like that? She probably didn't see me. She is a good girl just like me. How do you clean this thing? This thing. Here. Or maybe here? Where were you? I was worried. Hyuna. Hyuna. Why? Did you not see me before? When? At the market? I don't know what you're talking about. Jaehee... Why did you turn away? What? Are you embarrassed of me? Be quiet. Why are you like this? Hyuna's favorite fish bun. Rose's favorite sweet potato. It's so cold. Freezing. Hyuna. Rose. I brought some fish buns. It's so hot, hot. I'm here. I bought these for you. Be quiet! Aren't you late for school? Can't you knock? OK, OK.

Mother's Advise Scent in the mind lasts longer. Published by Vision. A song by Min Hye-Kyeong, "You look like a Rose" Light is green now. It is safe to cross. Hey, you don't see the lights changed? You don't see me crossing? You are talking back to me? Why are you taking that tone? You are the one that almost hit me. What? Did you just blame me? I was almost hurt. Shouldn't you be asking if I'm OK? I didn't even hit you. The traffic light changed. What are you looking at? Hey, hey. I'm talking. Listen to me. - Are you really OK? - Yeah. You are the same. How are you? You look great. I thought you were in US. Yeah. I'm in Korea as an exchange teacher. It hasn't been long since I came back. Teacher? I'm not teaching students. I'm at the university hospital. I wanted to see you. I didn't think we would meet at a place like this. - Were you going somewhere? - What? That seems quite heavy. Somebody wanted to borrow it. Looks like you are busy. I will be going. Give me that. I will take you. It's OK. You are busy. Go on. Did you forget how strong I am? Taxi! Bye. Let me take you. Bye. Take care. Give me your number. You can wire us the money. The employee's address? Wait a minute. Rose, you live here? I was just passing by. I think I really need a juice machine. You left this. Isn't this important? The address they gave me is around here somewhere. - Where's the boss? - He went out for lessons. When did this come out? - Yesterday. - It's so pretty. - I'll come again next time. - OK. Oh? Sting. How about $5 for this? $9? $6? Excuse me. Please come with me to the station. What? Let's go. I didn't do anything wrong. I need to ask her something. Ask her at the station. Go inside and talk. Isn't this a police station? I've never been inside a police station before. Wait a minute. Wait. Your name is... Myunghwan Ryu... Occupation. Doctor. Age. Hey. I wasn't trying to do anything to her. Then why did you follow me? You followed me from my home and kept looking at me. Mister. You are not from around here, right? I don't live around this neighborhood. You look like a decent person. You have a good job. Right? Of course. I'm a doctor. This is all a misunderstanding. People like you love children. You pedophile prick. Just sit still. You smooth faced creep! Did you contact the parent? Yes, she's on the way. Hey. Don't do that. Let's just... Trying to get out of it? Just sit down. When my mom comes, you are dead. She will eat you alive. - Sit down. - Hyuna. Where's my daughter? - Morn. - Hyuna, are you OK? What took you so long. I was so scared. Where is the pervert? You? What kind of pervert follows girls young enough to be your daughter? Hey. Show me your face. Hold up your perverted face. Myunghwan? Let me explain. What? You know this guy? I don't know, or I do... He is a stalker. He followed her all afternoon. - What? - Rose. It's not that... How do you know my mom's name? What's going on? You know the mother? You still stalk the daughter? The worst kind of pervert. I wasn't stalking her. She... Who did what? to Hyuna? Where is he? Hyuna, are you OK? This is the guy? You are the one? Don't worry, Rose. I got this. Officer! Do your job and throw him in jail! He should rot in jail. - Calm down and listen to me. - Listen what? Hey... You... You... Wait a minute. I've seen you all together before... Why are you all acting like you know one another? Hyuna. Aren't you hungry? I think there was a misunderstanding. We will be going now. Let's go. What misunderstanding? He followed me all day. - Let's go. - How do you know that guy? Hyuna, Let your mother take care of this. And we'll go, OK? OK. You go home with your dad. Yes, we will. I am not going anywhere. And he is not my dad. Hyuna. Why are you acting like this? Hyuna. Let's go with dad, OK? Then, the father can stay and finish this.. Yes, Daddy will. I told you that he is not my father. Who the hell is he? Let's just say I'm your dad. Let's just say I'm your dad. Just for today. You need a parent on days like today. So, just for today, I'm your dad. Tell him I'm your dad. Indeed, he is the dad. She has the same eyes. He is the dad, right? No way. Hyuna. Did I say something wrong? He has the same drooping eyes too. Everybody has same eyes today. I'm sorry. You have the same eyes. Whatever. Hyuna. Hyuna. Let's talk. Is it true? Hyuna. Is it true? Is he my father? You told me he passed away. How can you do this to me? Hyuna, I'm so sorry. I'll tell you everything. Let's go home. You are so selfish? Please... Hyuna. Why did you come back now? Who is her father? Why do you care? Who is the father? If it wasn't for you, we'd have been famous band. You messed everything up and ran away. Now you come back to piss us off? Asshole. You are the one to talk after stealing my girl. Stole her? I liked her first. You are the one who knocked her over. I never laid hands on her. She never gave me a chance, you bastard. You are in front of a police station. I couldn't touch her, ever. Help. Police! - Let me go. - I'll kill you! Sis. What happened? I don't know. Did you meet a rich guy? "Paycheck" This is your paycheck? Yes. I'm ranked only about middle. I don't know why I bothered with juicer sales. I totally regret it. Rose, you should quit and come work here. How could I? If I can do it, you can. You are good with words and you are pretty. You are not just pretty. You look trustworthy. No way. The day I got fired, you moved me. This time, let me return the favor. "Financial Consultant Manager, Choi Miran" Rose. Is she my daughter? You are very imaginative. Then who is the father? Who cares? She's my daughter. Don't take this the wrong way. I just want to know the truth. I don't know what you are talking about out of the blue. Just tell me. Is she my daughter? Even if that's true, nothing changes. Hyuna is, has been and will only be the daughter of this Rose. OK. I don't care! She's your daughter. I can't stop thinking about her. Wow. He just disappeared all this time Damn. He ran away. Now, he wants to act like a dad? What gives? I told him to buzz off. Problem is Hyuna. She won't talk to me. What should I do? We should have just told her I'm her father. I could have been somebody. Abba of Korea if it hadn't been that idiot. Just Abba? We could have been even bigger. Your hands are shaped to hold a mic. My face deserves spotlight. Why is it so dark? I'm so tired. My daughter. You are still up? You reek of booze. Go away. Sorry. I had a drink with Soonchul. Why don't you go live with him? What? You could live with him. You are lonely. He likes you. What's stopping you? Ridiculous. Stop talking nonsense. Go to sleep. School night. I'm not going to school. What? I'm not going to school. I'm gonna do whatever I want just like you did. Gonna live my life. What's gotten into you? It's hard for me too. So stop taking care of me and go live with him. Should I move out? Yeah, why don't you? I hate this dump smelling of mold. I only stayed here because I felt sorry for you. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. Hyuna. $0? So you just ran away? That must have hurt. We shouldn't. It's OK. It's not that. It's OK. Stop it. Shit. Just stay still. Don't. Stop. Hey. Did you see a pretty high school girl with short bangs and slightly droopy eyes? Who? Did you see a high school girl? What's this geezer saying? Is that your dad? Smoking... I'm a doctor. Smoking effects nerve systems that need oxygen. It may cause headache, drowsiness, heart disease, increase heart rate or nausea. - Hey. Hey. - Hyuna. Hyuna, are you OK? What are you doing? Who are you? I'm a doctor. Damn it. Bastards. What are you doing to Hyuna? Are you OK? Who touched Hyuna? You filthy bastards! I'm gonna kill you. Take this! Little bastards. Rose. Hyuna is... Can we talk about this? Hyuna. Hyuna. - Hyuna. - Morn. Mom. - Hyuna. - Morn. Hyuna. Hyuna, are you OK? Let me see. Are you hurt? It's OK if you are not hurt. You look like a fighter, but didn't even get a punch in. You got all beaten up by each and every one of them. They probably realize by now that they got a crack in their 6th ribs. That's bullshit? Stop it. You are so childish. Cut it out. I guess he is a natural born coward. Young kids nowadays. Keep your arms up. Did you just laugh? Aah... My ribs are... Ribs? What about it! I'll shove down pork ribs if you don't shut up! What happened today... I was just passing by... Thanks for today. Ehwa. What? Next stop Ehwa. Why are you doing this all of a sudden? I told you not to come. This is not an easy job. It's hard to do by yourself. I got this, so don't worry. I should add some hot water. My legs. Good morning. You need to do things in order. What's going on? It's early morning. Did you wake up? I'm doing wallpapers. Go back in and sleep some more. I called your teacher. Stop it. Why? I should finish the job. Why did you tear down perfectly fine wallpaper? If you are not gonna help me, just go back to sleep. I will try to be quiet. Look at all this dust. Mom, I'm sorry. I've been bad. Stop crying- I'm sorry too. Stop crying. Why are you crying like a baby? Morn. Sorry. Nice weather today. That looks nice to you? You are good at breaking the mood. It's been five, six years? We met briefly. It was brief but you cheered me up. When I came to see you, you refused to see me. Stop talking about the past. What else to do at our age, if not to cherish memories? It's not a good memory. There's no one around. You wanna kiss? - Shut up. - Sorry. The weather is nice. Are you OK? Good evening everyone. The whole country is fighting with the rainstorm. Han river is about to flood for the first in 5 years. Morn. Morn. What's up? Hyuna. Leave it. Pack your bags first. Morn. The lights. Don't worry. I shut it off. Morn. I think we need to go. Hyuna, block the sink with this. I don't think that will work. Hyuna. Hello? There's no vacancy? "No Vacancy" Where are we? - You are here. - Yeah. I'm gonna go back to the shelter. Are you crazy? How can you go to school from there. What about you? Gangja said I could stay at her place. But morn. We have nowhere to go. Still. Just go in. Take good care of her. Thank you. You can stay here too. I can go somewhere else. No, I can't. I'm OK. Come in. Bathroom is over there. Your room is here. I will go out at 8 in the morning and come back late at night. Door pass code and address is here. There's food in the fridge, so eat what you want. There's hot water in the tub. Hyuna. Are you in... You are not here. She is just like me. Try this. It's a juicer. Try this. Kids love it. - It's good, right? - Come check it out. Why are the boxes so wrinkled up? The bottom of the box got wet when we were moving it. Everything inside is perfect. No problem. Think about it and come back. Just leave it. I will take care of it. Here. This is for you. Take this. CD Player. How did you? They were giving it away at the hospital. I thought you might like it. I don't need it. I picked few CDs that you might enjoy. Thank you. I didn't even thank you for before. No thanks needed. Thank you. Don't worry about it. Hey, you are here. Want something to drink? I'm fine. This is a small gift for you. It's a neck tie. Thanks for taking care of Hyuna. Water is all gone. We just need to reorganize. Things should be good in about two days. It's no problem. Take as much time as needed. What's this? Did you know she writes music? Yes... of course. I showed it to a professor I know. He said it's really good. He asked if it was really written by a high school student. Yeah? That good? I think with proper teaching she can be a great musician. Faster the better. I don't know. I just want Hyuna to have a normal and happy life. Meet a nice guy. I know some famous people in this field. They recommended me these schools. - World's best schools. - What? This is important for Hyuna. I will pay for everything. Stop it. I know Hyuna is smart. I will take good care of her. Don't do this. I know I don't have any rights, but I'm still her father. This could be the most important moment in Hyuna's life. You have no say in this. I will take care of her. Hyuna. - Here. - Morn. How have you been? Is the water gone from our house? I wanna go home. Is it uncomfortable? Yeah, a little. Why? Is he not nice to you? Maybe it's because I've never lived with a man before. I might have to find a boy to live with to get used to it. Horrible things you say. I worry what you'd become when you grow up. How about... Record shop owner? Why are you so serious? What about record shop owner? Mom, what are you doing? Give me some. Nope. I'm beat. Sorry. The office is a mess. So this is Rose Hong? I don't know anything about finance. Is that OK? We can teach you all that. Don't worry about it. Let me show you how we invest. We invest in big stocks on the market. So, the initial investment is safe? This fund is backed by the government, so the investment is always safe. So, you will give me 20% interest in 1 year? Yes. Hey, you didn't hear me? I invested in it myself. Hengu's mom too? Yeah! You can't lose unless the country goes bankrupt. Do you think the country will go bankrupt? When I was young, I did whatever I wanted. I quit my factory job to be a singer. I should have become a singer. But instead, I got knocked up and ran away. I thought I became a grown up after Hyuna was born. Like other moms dedicated for their daughters. But it wasn't like that. I don't even know what she wants to be. I've been living the same way as before. I'm gonna really live for Hyuna from now on. I'm gonna work my ass off, move to a nice house, let her study what she wants, find her a man who makes her happy. I'm gonna do everything for her. It's not the best house, but it should be good enough for you, Hyuna, and me. We can live happy together. Your room is done with your favorite wallpaper. I saved up to propose to you properly. It took longer than expected. If this was 20 years ago, I would have said yes. How can I marry you now? When you know too much about me inside and out. It's OK with me. Besides, you are still a mystery to me. Find someone who is more suitable for this house. I don't deserve it. Congratulations, Rose Hong. Thank you. Thank you. - Dinner's on you. - Dinner! Yeah! It's just a gift certificate. Open this. I'm so curious. - Wait. - I'll do that. It's a juicer. Wow. Miss Kim, you can have it. We now live in an apartment. Morn. Yahoo! Mom's room? Wow. Ta-da. Is this my bed? - Of course. - I love it. Smile. One, two, three. Hello? Who is this? I think you have the wrong number. You are good. Not all apartments have this. My mom's so pretty. Oh yeah? Look here. One, two, three. One, two, three. You must be hungry. Let's go eat some ribs. Morn, actually... What is it? What? Eric Clapton concert? This is today. I got it yesterday. Can I go? Of course. Have a good time. Thanks. Eric Clapton. I've never seen you so excited. "$35 billion will be immediately sent to South Korea "provided by IMF, World Bank, "and Asian Development Bank." "Korea officially requests $208 to IMF" The emergency request to IMF has been granted. Good morning. We will be funded for aid with $558. However our economy will be governed by IMF. I don't wish to put us down, but today's a grim day for Korea. What's up? People are asking for their money back. What did we do wrong? OK, OK. Do you know the pyramid scheme? I will explain it in simple terms. Here's Dong Hyun Park Here is Miran. Here is everyone else. At the bottom are the customers. The customers can't get any money back. Dong Hyun Park. Charged with fraud. You are all middle men. Also charged with fraud. What? You are so clueless. You will be arrested and sent to prison. Mom's home. Gangja's sweet and sour pork is awesome. How nice. Yeah. Didn't you work at a Chinese restaurant? Yeah. You remember that? The noodles were surprisingly delicious. Aunt Gangja was the chef. I did serving and deliveries. You worked really hard. I will take care of you when you're old. That's nice. If you are done, go to your room. OK. Thank you for the food. Sure. Did I hear right? Yeah. I can't get the money back? What should I do? That was retirement and mortgage loan money. How can I find work when the country is going bankrupt? Gangja. I will find a way. You didn't know what you were doing, so it's OK. I still can't help but hating you. I guess we are both too naive. We are too dumb and will probably go down in flames together. Let's not see each other again. Wait. Here it is. 5,1,8... So what am I supposed to do? OK, OK. This is the place. Are you happy living in an apartment bought with our money? No, no. You didn't think we would find this place? I'm looking for a way. Please wait a bit. Move aside. There's nothing here. I'll find a way if you give me some time. Hey. Rose. Rose Hong. Where did you go? - Rose. - I can't come out right now. Come over next time. Why aren't you answering the phone? Let's talk next time. Open the door. It's an emergency. Gangja... How dare you show up here? We are broke. My wife's dead. How could you do this to us? She worked at a factory for over 20 years. My wife did everything for you. How... "Lucky Realtor" It's a fairly new house. This is an insane price. You are very lucky. Stamp here. Here you go. This is such a good deal. It is better to keep it. No. I will withdraw all of them. "Account closed" Check heart rate of patient in room 3 every two hours. Yes, sir. Hyuna. Take her to US. What? I have not always been a good mother to Hyuna. But I still want to make good choices. What is going on? Please. You are home. Mom, mom, mom! What's going on? I'm going to LA. Crazy. Crazy! Really? That's great. This is awesome. Right, right? Have some tea. Thanks,dean The stars are pretty. You like it? Yeah, very much. Let's live in a cabin by the beach together? White sands, sound of waves. What do you think? Whatever. You will leave me as soon as you meet a boyfriend. You are so emotionless. You did well to raise me. When I go to university, I will do part time jobs and take care of you. Are you crying? You are moved by what I said? - I'm not crying. - Are you going through menopause? Yeah, I'm going through menopause. You want to face the wrath of a woman in menopause? Sorry. I give up. It was my bad. - Don't say that again. - OK, OK. You are not going to tell me what's going on? Take good care of Hyuna. If I knew back then... things would have been different. As I watched Hyuna grow, I thanked you in my mind. I never blamed you. How about going to US together? What's taking her so long? She's gonna miss the flight. Let me go check on her. Hurry. Don't miss the flight and come back crying. Morn, you will be OK? When did you think so much about your morn? Look. Over there. He is waiting for you. Myunghwan. Is this the place? Hyuna. Let's hurry. Mom, wait. Morn. Here. Always wear this pin thinking your daughter is with you. Hyuna. Let's hurry. You will miss the flight. Yeah. Are you sure this is the place? Morn. What's wrong? Don't forget to eat breakfast. Never go to slam or whatever it's called. If there's anything you need, tell Myunghwan. I asked him to take good care of you. OK. OK. Here's the elevator. You are not coming down with me? I need to go to the office now. Sorry. Hyuna. Have a safe trip. OK. Go see Hyuna. Do you still think you are a burden to Hyuna? Stop it. What did you do so wrong? Going to jail? - That wasn't your fault. - I said stop it. You two. I have been watching you the longest. I can't be sure, but Hyuna is probably not all that happy. What is happiness? Is happiness not being able to do what you want and helping poor morn? Hyuna is probably a much greater person than you can imagine. I think I made the right choice. - Bye. Bye. - Bye. I call shotgun. I will be going. Drive safe. Hey. You are a good morn. Work up a little more courage, OK? Bye then. Did you propose? Yeah. We are a thing now. Today's first day as couple. - Nice. - Let's go celebrate. Today's special guest is a winner of world's most prestigious classic record award. Winner of UK's Gramophone award's modern music division. She is a composer known as South Korea's Bernstein. Please welcome her with applause. Welcome. I come to Korea every year, but haven't met my mother yet. I've been searching. I hope that she sees me when I do concerts. I really hope she does. It was a pleasure to have you on the show. We are going to hear Hyuna's piano as a final stage. It's a k-pop song. This is an arrangement of a song my morn used to sing. Let's have a round of applause for Hyuna. See you next week. Hyuna. It's me your mother. It must have been hard to have me as a mother. You deserved much better. I was a first timer as a mother so I was not good at it. When you were around. I was never lonely or tired. - Shall we go? - Yeah. Promise me one thing. Sometimes there will be hardships and sadness in your life. Be strong in those times. I probably won't be with you when you are going through the tough times. That's the biggest regret I'll have. Even if you want to see me, Don't look for me. When I'm ready, I will look for you. I promise. Thank you, Hyuna for being such a good daughter. I hope you become my daughter in our next lives. I will do better next time. Always smile. I love you. Hyuna. Morn. - Hello? - Hello? Are you two together? - No, no. - I came alone. I don't know this guy. Wait. Where are you from? - I'm from US. - I'm from Ehwa. Morn. That room is...
