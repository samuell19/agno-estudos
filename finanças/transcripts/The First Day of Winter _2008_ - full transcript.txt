The orbital velocity is faster near the sun. slower in the aphelion. The most distant point from the sun. That's why seasons are the same duration. I went to check the lamp and the batteries are gone. Unbelievable! Who would have done that? Probably one of the old ladies, They spend more time in the cemetery than at home. But I can't say anything, just pretend nothing's happened. I have to take the Moped to the mechanic. I say "good morning" How are you doing? While I think she has stolen the batteries from the grave. It just won't start. You had it repaired the last month. I wanted to do it myself, but it doesn't work. You can take the bus, right? I need the Moped to take Michela to school. Should I walk there? Come on guys! Move! Can you fix the record player? No. - I know everything. - What? I saw you in the locker room. - What are you talking about? - You jerked each other off. You guys are fags.

So what do you want? - A new record player. - A record player? They are 30 years old, rare and no longer manufactured. When you are going to get the moped back? In two days. So tomorrow we go back? Maybe I would like new shoes. Do you like that? Of course, you like the bread? Slowly, slowly. here is some apple. I don't think she will like it. It's never in the cage. Exactly but with a travel cage ... She thinks that it's like a prison. Better there than on the table. - Did you ask her? - Yes. - She wants a record player. - Where do we get one. I can try to fix grandmother's. The cage is perfect. You'll see she won't like it. Let me use your Moped. No. Give me the keys. - Ok. do what you want. - Wait.

You know that ... ... when she is angry she doesn't speak for a week. I can't help it ... If you had at least picked her up. How the hell could I do that? There's no reason to curse. The moped broke down, I had to push it to school. How could you not pick her up? When I arrived she was already gone. - Say you're sorry at least. - It wasn't my fault. You're crazy. Since when do you talk to the rabbit? Idiot. Tell your friend I need his bike today. - His scooter? - No, his mountain bike. You're crazy, I'm not going to do that. Ah, no?
