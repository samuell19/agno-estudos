Naiwen, there are plenty of medicines inside and antibiotics too lf you are willing to pay l can bring more Don't believe him He must be sent to kill me Naiwen, don't be paranoid The brothers at the riverside must be killed by Fat Pig's men lf l didn't have my doubts, l'd be dead by now l feel this guy is dangerous What do you think? lt's okay, don't worry lt's been a long time Who are those wearing blue clothes?
