Subtitles by explosiveskull Hello? Sadie, is that you? Yeah. Uh... Sorry. You, uh... you never pick up. Can I... Can... can I see your face? No. I've missed you so much, poppet. Did you get my letters, you know, my emails? Yeah, but... but I didn't read them. Why? Seriously? Yeah. Are... are you alone? Yeah. Why? What is that? What? That noise. It sounds like a... a big ass chain on the floor. Dad? Dad? Dad? You know, I... I've got to go. But you just called. Yeah. Sorry, poppet. I love you so much. Sadie? Sadie? Oh, fuck! Oh. Leave my girl! Anything but my girl! Hm. Hm. Sorry. I'm Dan. John gave me the keys. You're Sadie, right? Did you move his shit? What? Because It wasn't left like this. It was the cops who went through his shit, I just put it right. It's all there. Jeez, what crawled up your ass? Uh, I'm sorry. About John. Don't be. He was an asshole. I liked him. Lucky you. What's with the, um, the cameras? Don't know. He wouldn't say. Did you come for the job? What? What your dad got for you. What are you talking about? John was under the impression you were coming to stay with him. No. Okay. I'll... see you around. Wait. What job? Photographer. For the paper. Tony Jones, Editor. If you're interested, give him a call. Hold on. Key? Nice knowing you! Asshole. Daddy? Oh. Are they the moors? Is that what you came here for? Hello? Hi, I'm Sadie Wright. I've got an appointment with Tony. Right. So, uh, you're John's lass? So they say. And you're a Yank? - Born here, bred over there. - Hm. You don't look like him. Thank you? Hey. I don't look like my dad. He were black. Oh. So, you're a photographer? Stroke journalist. I've just graduated. Aye, he said. Begged me to give you a job. Really? Yeah. Odd that. He said you were coming across. And then, let slip that, uh... you hadn't spoken since you were a kid. Fuck me. Kinky! Are you embarrassed? Why? 'Cause I know what you Limeys are like. So... what're your plans for the future? Going back to the, uh, good old US of A? I don't know. Mom hates me living here, so I guess that's good enough reason to stay. That's your dad talking. Bollocks to the rules. Have you got your documents? ID, passport. We need it for the paperwork. Am I hired? Listen. This newspaper's failing. We've got about... six months max. So, if you want short-term, you're in the right place. Plus, I owe it to your dad. He were a bloody good reporter. That Padfoot shit he cooked up, really saved our bacon. Why'd he top himself? You tell me. Oh. He looked tired in those last few days. Probably cancer. Get yourself to the bottom office, that's where you'll start. Okay. Shit! I said we'd get caught. Smartass. Shut the door, then! What do you want? I'm Dan's new partner. Oh. He didn't say he'd been partnered with a girl. Faye. Sadie. You're American. How exotic. That's me. Uh, right, we should probably get down to some work, so... Yeah. See you later. Uh, you're there. So, are you, like, my boss? Yeah. So, who was the slut? My fiancée. Oh. Okay. Hello? You're kidding? No. No, he's a nutcase. Yeah, okay... Okay, I'll take her with me. Yeah, bye. What're you doing? They're enchanting. Full of demons. Really? So say our readers. What's left of them. - Shit. - What? Battery's dead. Good start. I've got more in my bag. No photos! So, let me guess, Craig. You've seen the Burning Girl. Haven't you? Okay, so what do you want to tell us about? I know who's got the Demon Eye. Don't bullshit me, Craig. Your readers are gonna love this. Can you tell me about the Demon Eye? Well, I've got to tell you, it will blow your mind. I know more than you could ever imagine. Sorry. Say it again. You've grown, poppet. What did you say? Me and your dad, we go way back. We used to talk to the shadows together. Look at you two, eh? The perfect accident. Your dad took too much and he paid the price. I'll be in the car. He could go to some dark places. You remember? What're you talking about? He broke you. Didn't he? Jesus Christ! Poppet? - Go screw yourself. - Sadie! We'll come back. Do you still cut yourself? - Fuck you! - Sadie! Ah. It's good to bleed. Just like Daddy. He took his own life, you dick! - Sadie! - He was murdered. - We're leaving. - Murdered! Murdered! Murdered! Sadie. Sadie! Tell Tony I'm sick. Who gives a shit about Tony? Get your hands off me! Don't let him get to you. Murdered? He just wants attention. Well, he got mine. What are you taking? I used to see shit without these. Shit that wasn't there. Should you drink with them, too? Are you a doctor now? As well as a miserable dick. All right, listen. First of all, I know that you're upset about your dad. Even though you say you don't give a shit, it's obvious that you do. Second of all, don't you ever act like you did back there when we were on the job. I know to you, this is just a piss around, but it's a career for me. And third of all, the reason I'm such a miserable dick is 'cause I miss John, too! Did Dad have cancer? Not that I know of. Well, then, why did he do it? Look, there was no note, no nothing. I'm not sure we'll ever find out why. He was an asshole. And that... freak was right. He was greedy, he did whatever he wanted. But murdered? I mean, come on, seriously? Don't listen to Craig. He just wants to get inside your head. I can't drink that. Do you like to smoke? You mean, grass? Yeah. I'm in. It's in my car. Just... give me a minute. You ready? Um, yeah. No more. Why? Because you might as well inject it into my ass. And what's wrong with your ass? Tell me more about the Burning Girl. It's just... folklore. From the Moors. Well, you were buying it with crazy Craig. It sells papers. There's folk round here thinks it needs to be put back. Why? Are you ready for your history class, Miss Wright? Yes, Mr. Pothead. I'll have none of your cheek or you'll go over my knee. - In 1851... - Mm-hm. ...a young weaver named Sally Pearson was woken in the night by her beloved dog. She rose from her bed. Grabbed her father's tools, and crafted a piece of tin into the shape of an eye. The Demon Eye. The amulet. She said it was an act of God, the work of a higher power. But she also said that it spoke to her. Saying what? That a famine would gut the Moors and its people would perish, if they didn't turn their back on sin. What kind of sin? Drinking, gambling... sex. All the fun stuff. And? The people laughed in her face. And the famine took half the town. So they made her a saint? No. They took her for a witch. She was marched up the Moors, and her eyes were plucked out of her skull. After that, they burnt her alive. With her dog chained to her side. Padfoot? Padfoot. And after the ashes settled, all that was left was the amulet. The Demon Eye. A warning from the creator. It was left in the earth for... nearly 200 years. Until? Someone found it. Or so they say. That's why they think business is bad and the town is failing. It's nothing to do with the Lehman Brothers. So why hold onto it? The Demon Eye will give you whatever you desire. But the price is pain. Pain? Delivered by two deadly demons. Padfoot... And the Burning Girl. Shit. Right. John put that together. Readers love it. But there's got to be replicas or some shit. No. Not in this town. No one would dare. What would you wish for if you had the eye? You don't want to know. What? This isn't good. What? See you tomorrow. No, wait. You stupid fat bitch! Why did you make me, Dad? I'm never... I'm never... never good enough. - About time. - Where've you been? It's over an hour. No signal. Oh, my god. Have you been sick? - Jesus. - You're worse than your dad. Why would you say that? Look, can we just fake this, please? Faye, stand there. Are you okay? Get over yourself, asshole, I was just drunk. Like this? Look, have a think, Faye. Okay, the story is, you were out here hiking, and then, out of nowhere, you see the ghost of the Burning Girl. This is where Sally was set on fire? We don't know, but we need a story, so... welcome to fake news. Not yet. A bit more this way. Right, that's fine. And point into whatever you were doing. Yeah. Mm-hm, okay. Are you kidding me? Screw you! I don't think you're cut out for this. Are you still in there? Go home if you want, you're not needed. Hello? I'm not going anywhere. Is that from today? No. Shit. Oh, my god! Right. What've we got? Nothing, except for fat selfies. Fuck off, Faye. What happened? The weather turned. We couldn't get the shot. Bollocks! Well, we're gonna need something. Both of you, get home and make something up. They want Padfoot. I'll sign it off. You should go back to America, you know. What? You're a bit too big for here. Fuck you, Faye. I'm sorry about this. I know we had plans. She's got her eye on you. Don't be stupid. She has. What're you doing? Showing her who's boss. Just ignore her, she just wants attention. I'll just be a couple of minutes. Okay. You all right? Yeah, I'm just tired, that's all. Do you want to come in? Yeah. Hi, Mom. This is Sadie. I know. I knew your dad. Long time ago. I've just come to grab my laptop. You're not with Faye tonight? No. I'm working with Sadie tonight. I won't be long. Yeah. Excuse me. Mom? Shit! I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. I don't want an apology from you. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. I don't want an apology from you. What do you want, then? I want you to keep out of my business. I'm just trying to help her, make her feel better. She's bad news. You keep away from her. Stop telling me what to do. She's trouble, the same as he was. Just keep away from her! Let's go. Do you have a dog? No. I hate them. Why? No reason. Your mom seemed pretty upset. Yeah. She's always like that. Has to get her own way. Were you talking about me? Yeah. And? Do we have to do this now? I guess not. She hates me doing this job. Thinks I could do better. What's that got to do with me? Do you mind if I stay the night? Sure. Uh, Tony wants an article on Padfoot, so we'll just have to make something up. Do you mind if I get a quick bath before we get down to it? Sure. Uh, where's John's files? They'll give us a head start. They're in the kitchen. Um, his papers are a bit spread out. I'm a messy worker. Right. Is it on? Yeah, yeah. Right, uh, okay. Uh... Well, I don't know who's gonna be watching this, but... Well, I, uh... I need to share my thoughts. Okay, so, uh, well... Here we are. So I've, uh, I've had this lot put in. And, uh... Well, it's cost me a bob or two. But they won't miss a trick. Gonna be my eyes and ears. Prove, uh, well... Prove I'm not going mad. It's here. Listen. Dan? Dan, is that you, mate? Craig? You don't scare me, Craig. Look, I've told you. Just a few more days, and it's going back where it belongs. It's the only way we can end all of this. Craig? Shit. Shit! Shit! What the fuck are you? You fucking sick bitch! Fuck's sake! Fucking... What the fuck are you? Fuck. What the fuck is happening to me? One more day. One more day, that is all I can take. They're... They're haunting me. Everywhere I go, asleep, awake... They're fucking ever changing, you know, shape-shifting. But the Demon Eye is working. I'm getting my family back. And that's all I've ever wanted. What is it? There... there's something in the water. There's nothing here. I'd lay off the drink for a while. What's with the lights? They keep on going off. I can't do shit without my laptop. Let's turn in for the night. Come in. If you need me, just call. Oh. What? Oh, nothing. I just, I just thought... Do you want me to stay in here? Because I can. If that's what you want? Okay. About the pills... It's none of my business. What? I mean, it's private. You're so English. Christ. I've been in therapy since I was, like, eight. Telling you my shit is really no big deal. Sorry. I've had psychotic episodes, in the past. Right before I turned... 16. The quack said it was down to acute anxiety. Mom thinks it's the trauma I suffered here as a kid, and... I put it down to the shit load of LSD I took to get through school. Why was school so bad? I... I was fat. Like, uh, really fat. Never fit in. Never had a boyfriend. Always a loner. Really? But, um, whatever triggered the visions, I've not suffered since. So... Until tonight. Yeah. What happened... when you lived here? Did John... No, no. Nothing like that. He was the best dad ever. We used to, um, play with these... my little dolls, you know, make houses for them, take them for a walk, have tea parties together. He loved it. So what happened? Daddy? You don't have to tell me. My mom couldn't live with him, so... she moved back to the States and took me with her. How did... How did you meet him? Me? Meet John? - Yeah. - Uh... That's a bit of an odd one, really. I was all set to go off to Oxford. I'd just got a place to study English Literature then. Then I saw an ad in the paper for a reporter. You turned down Oxford to work at The Echo? Yeah. That's what my mom said. She's still pissed off with me, and... Truth is, I don't know why I did it. But, John interviewed me and... I just knew. What? That was my future. Sounds stupid. No, it doesn't. Sorry. This feels... I need to take it slow. Can we do that? Just... one step at a time. Okay. I want to be with you. Hello? Hey, hon, it's me. Mom. What? Are you still in bed? It's got to be, like, 11:30 over there. Is everything okay? Are you taking your meds? What? Are you harming again? Don't start that shit. I'm worried about you. I know. Is the house on the market yet? No. I'm gonna stay over here for a couple of weeks. - Maybe months. - What? - Why? - There's opportunity over here. For what? Oh, my god. Do not get dragged into your father's world, Sadie. He was a very dark man... Have you heard of the Burning Girl? Who hasn't? Where's she buried? Out there, somewhere. There's only one person who knows that. Yeah? Craig Cooper. Folk reckon he dug up the Demon Eye. Well, what do you think? I think he should be locked up. Bloody devil worshipper. Into the occult and black magic. Sick in the head if you ask me. - Get out! - I'm sorry. - You're fired. - I overslept. Where's my front page? - I, I'm... - Look. I don't mind you staying up all night drinking, it's part of the job. God knows, your father was always doused in drink, but he always came in and he never missed a deadline. - Ever! - We have something. A lead on the Demon Eye. Aye, Dan said. He did? Look, I don't know what's going on between you two, but Faye's having a bloody breakdown, so nobody's making my coffee! Now, I am telling you, as your boss, you keep your hands off his cock or you find a new job. Now I've got to go and see the chief exec, and tell him why my staff are a useless pile of dog shit! Eight 'o' clock tonight. I want a good headline. Or the both of you, you're yesterday's news. Wait! - Where's Dan? - Down the Red Lion. Meeting Craig. What're you doing here? My job. We made a mistake last night. Are you playing me? No, we made a mistake with work. I never miss a deadline. Why didn't we get something to Tony? Well, let's put that right. What's this about? Crazy Craig. I think he has the Demon Eye. That's a big story. Are you sure? I don't know, but... if I can get him to open up. And if he really has it, put it on display... it might go national. Why Craig? Why now? I saw something, last night. A video, in the basement. John had the amulet. And it wasn't found by the police, and it wasn't found in his belongings. I think Craig took it from him. You were in the basement? Did you see the cameras filming the house? Yeah. Did you see me in the bath? Yeah. Did you like it? Yeah. Come on. Let's go. - Ah. - Sorry about that. Sadie's joining us. - If you don't mind? - Not at all. Have you calmed down, poppet? Why did you say my dad was murdered? - 'Cause he was. - Let's not go there again. Craig. You were telling me about the Demon Eye. Uh... Yeah. Get us another drink, eh, Dan? What? Another drink. Or shall I get going? How do you know he was murdered? Because I killed him. I gave him the Demon Eye. Look. Has it got inside you already yet? 'Cause it got inside mine. Made me... drive my eye out. Sleep, awake, it's all the same to me. What did you ask for? I... I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. You've got the eye around your neck. Look, I can make the Burning Girl stop. I don't want to live anymore. So why don't you give me the eye back? Dan? What? Are you all right, poppet? Stay away from me. Dan? She'll take away your eyes. Fuck off. Dan!! Doors open. Did you sleep with him? What're you talking about? Dan! Did you shag him? - No. - Liar! He said you shared a bed. Yeah, but... but nothing happened. You fat slag. I'm pregnant. Does he know that? He does now. You've had your fun. Now you'll never see him again. I've had you fired. And do us a favor. Go home and find a rope. Your dad's waiting for you. We'll see about that. Excuse me. Keys. See ya. I doubt it. What happened? What are you doing here? The backdoor key's under the mat. I can't take this. I've got to get out of here. What? What about me? - You have your baby! - No, I don't want it. I told her to get rid of it. I want to be with you. Well, what about Faye? Where are you going? Home. I'll come with you. Just don't reject me. Never. You're a part of me. It's killing me. Slowly. Look, I have to return the Eye to Sally's grave, then... then... then she'll leave me in peace. This is where Craig found it. I... I don't know why, why he gave it to me. Maybe... maybe to watch me suffer. Fuck! Look. Bloodletting, in this shrine that I've built. It... it's the only way... Fuck! Fuck! Leave me alone!! Mm. Wakey-wakey! Help! No. You won't be heard down here. Daddy? Jesus Christ. It was you. With my dad, all those years ago. We were looking for answers. And the Eye gifted me that. But I didn't quite like what I saw. Let her go, or I'll kill you. Hey! We're dead anyway! The Burning Girl will see to that. It's ironic, isn't it? John always wanted to see his children together. And here you are. In the flesh. Leave her alone! What're you talking about? Oh. Haven't you told her? Dan here... is your brother. You're sick. Tell her. - I said, tell her! - It doesn't matter! We didn't know each other. I love you. No. No, no, no! Why? Did you know from the beginning? Of course, he knew. But you wanted him. You wanted his touch, so the Eye granted it to you. So, where is it? Where is the Demon Eye? She doesn't have it! I left it at work! - Liar! - I swear! I know it's hard to give up. I gave it to your dad. And he promised to give it back to me. But you know what? The Burning Girl will show me the way. She likes the smell of blood. It's upstairs. Under my bed. Don't shovel me shit! There won't be a second chance. There's a blade behind you. Hurry up! - It's cutting my wrists. - Deal with it! You have the Demon Eye? Just cut it! It's too late. Untie me. Come on. No! You're my brother! We didn't know each other. - It's still sick! - I want to be with you. We'll go to hell for this. We've got to get out of here. Leave it. I have to put it back or she'll kill me. Put it back where? Come on. What are you doing? Where's this? Uh, that's where we took the photograph. So she should be buried about 30 or 40 feet west of there. Let's go. She's gonna wrench his eyes out, poppet! She's gonna kill you, too. You have to get out of here. - What? - Put it back. - I'm not leaving you! - Get out. - You have to put it back. - No! Go! Get out! Sadie? Is that you? Dad? I've missed you so much, poppet. Daddy? You'll be safe with me. Dad? You won't have to cut yourself anymore. Come on! Sadie? Are you gonna get out of bed? Get out of bed, Sadie! I can't, Mom. I'm too sick. Sadie. Dan? In here. What're you doing in here? Dan? You killed Faye. What? You wanted her dead. No. No. No. There's no way out. She gave us what we wanted, and now, we have to pay for our sins. No, no, no! Dan? Dan? You killed my baby. Dan? Ah! Now leave us alone. She's gonna kill my boy. He needs more time. - How? - I love you, Sadie! I don't think I'm coming home. Does she want my blood, eh? - I don't know. - No, no, no. She wants you to see what she sees. She wants your eyes. What? No, no, no! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! You want blood? I'll give you my blood! What do you want, Tony? Thought I'd see how you were. I don't know where Dan is. I know that's why you're really here. Do you know what that is? It feels and sounds like a paper. That's an increase in profits. The Echo is back. We can't print 'em fast enough. Craig attacking you, Faye pushed to her death, her fiancé on the run. You've got a story to tell. And we've got the money to pay for it. Surgery in the States don't come cheap. You're gonna need funds if you want your sight back. The thing is, Tony... I never really liked what I saw. That's my cab, so... Do you want a hand? I can manage. Well, you know where to find me. Are you all right? Where's the car? Just in front of you. There's a medal here, Miss. Put it in the bag. I think I deserve it. Subtitles by explosiveskull
