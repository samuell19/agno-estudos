I've dream of it many times, as if I see it in front of me, night or day, but… The place seemed different, undefined… Somehow strange… Would you like to rest? Should we have a little break? Oh. No, no, I want to say it. They were shooting at us. Then my brother fell over me. I closed my eyes and I felt something wet over me. And that was all… I remember, later it got cold, I felt very, very cold. Then I got up, when darkness fell. I knew that no one else was alive. This I knew without doubt. First thing I saw was the minaret. It was in flames. And two or three houses at the other end of the village. The men carried torches and canisters with gas, and the raincoats were to protect them from the fire. I was holding my mother by the hand, as if to encourage her. They started shouting: "Let go, separate!" "Men go to this side, women to that side." My mother was old and very ill. Do you recognise any of the men on the photo in front of you? I never saw my mother again. When you did the burials, was it on June 8th or 9th? Some women say it was the 8th, some say the 9th. I don't remember. We had only two spades, and we dug in shifts. It took a long time. The earth was dry. But we buried them all, all 11 men. I need some clarification. Could it be that it all was happening in July? No, no, it was June. I remember the poppies. Poppies bloom in June. You have denied as untrue, all testimonies of the witnesses, stating that you have been seen, acting as a commanding officer of military troops. One winter I wore an old military trench coat, but, perhaps, I'd save some of your time if I told you that I don't know any of the witnesses that spoke here. I am a teacher. A Serbian teacher. By education and by vocation. For 30 years, I've being teaching the children in the Bratunac region to speak and write correctly. - I have taught them… - I am warning you that you should answer only the questions you've been asked and only in direct relevance to these questions. I don't know any of the witnesses that spoke here. I'm a hundred percent sure. Yes, I've definitely been in the area of Bratunac, because I live there, I was born there. My parents were born there. My grandparents on my father's side were born there. My grandparents on my mother's side too. I believe it's high time to close this trial. Not only because the prosecutor hasn't brought so far any reasonable evidence against my client, but also the total absence of constructive legal ideas creates a vacuum that compromises the Tribunal itself. All rise! Good morning. The court announces a "semi-closed" session. I swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Is the name written here yours? Yes. You may take your seat, sir. May I stand? We'll ask you a few questions. If you don't understand any of the questions, please, do not hesitate to ask for clarification. Witness K-109, where are you from? I don't know exactly where I was born, because I was abandoned as a child. I've lived in seven homes for abandoned children, but I know that I'm from Bosnia. But I am from Bosnia. How did you get involved with a Serbian paramilitary organisation named Guardia? I was playing football in school, we were the regional champions. Later, we used to play in a sports' hall in Zvornik. I met there with guys who were training to be guards, we became friends. They enlisted because they were Serbs, and I did because I wanted to play. And what is your religion? I am an orphan, I don't know. I don't know what my parents' religion was. What was your position in Guardia? Soldier. Volunteer, it's the same. Are you ready for the identification? - Now? - Yes. I am ready. Bring in the defendant. The defendant, do you recognise the individual at the witness's bench? No. Witness K-109, do you recognise the individual seated at the defendant's bench? Yes. Who do you know him to be? This is my military commander, Milorad Krstić. May I sit down? Were you under Milorad Krstic's command in the region of Bratunac and specially in the village of Gologva, between the 9th and the 12th of May? Yes. Witness K-109, did you take part in the arson of the mosque and the Muslims' houses in the above-mentioned village in the evening of the 9th of May, 1992? Yes. Could you tell us about it? We started from Zvornik. We reached the village around 5:30 p.m. Our commanders went to the House of Culture. We split in groups, as planned. Jesus, finally! This is a break-through! Save a slot in the prime news, guys! …we had orders to set the houses on fire… I don't know this boy! The defendant Krstić, you are not allowed to speak without our permission! After you set all the Muslims' houses on fire, after the men were separated from the women and the women were driven away, what happened to the men? We took them to the school. Did anyone protest? Did you shoot at them? There were casualties. One in the beginning. His wife didn't want to let his hand go. They were still in front of their house. He was young. And another one, much older, who didn't want to get in the classroom. They… we shot him in the corridor. As for the bodies, I don't know where they took them. Just two of them. Is it true that the women who didn't want to leave were mistreated? Yes. Tell us about it. There were seven or eight. Eight women. Two of them were very old. The others were younger. We took them to a white house in the northern end of the village, in the basement. I had to keep guard. Were the women in the white house raped? Yes. Did you see it happening? At first I only heard their screams. Then I saw it. Was the defendant Krstić inside the white house during these events? No translation. - Is she Bosnian? - I don't know. I'm sorry. Was the defendant Krstić inside the white house during these events? Yes, he was. Your Honour, I have several questions for the witness. Mr. Finn, you'll ask your questions in the next session. These questions are of utmost importance. Court will now recess. Just one question! It's recess. I have to be absolutely sincere. I have to be sincere. In fact, we're starting from scratch again. We have to start from scratch again. We have to concentrate. We have to find something to start with. We have to concentrate. We have to find something to start with. Maybe that white house. Maybe that white house. What bloody white house, boy? - What did he say? - What, what white house? You must know that boy from somewhere. And look at me, damn it, I'm your lawyer. You must know this boy… I don't know this boy. He doesn't know him. If I can't comprehend why he told us this story, if it's not true, I can't do anything else and in fact I will be of no use to you. If I can't comprehend why he told us this story, if it's not true, I can't do anything else and I won't be of any use to you. God himself can't help you understand. It's something different, it's in our blood. We are born with it. God himself can't make you understand. "My Bosnia is land of hatred." "Anyone who didn't want to hate has become a stranger, a freak, and often, a martyr." So, what did he say? He's talking about hatred, but it's impossible to translate his words. What about hatred? He quoted one of our writers, Ivo Andric. May I ask you something? Do you choose your clients yourself? You're judging me? No, I'm not judging you. It's… It's just important that I know that. I felt your hostility towards my client. Of course, I have no idea what you've been through, what you experienced, but I know exactly how you feel about me. You think that I'm unscrupulous person, interested only in money. A man without moral. When they took all Muslim men to the school and the women to the buses, the Dutch military man, uh, told the Serbian officer, that I'm their translator and they need me. Then the Serb told me: "You can go now but I can't promise that one of my boys won't shoot you in the back." I didn't translate this to the Dutchman, I was ashamed to. And he didn't ask me to, so I went. Nobody shot me. I reached the buses and got in one. I've asked myself a thousand times after that, what did the Dutchman understand? Did he understand what's going on? In that school I left my father, my uncle, two cousins and my friends. That Serb, when he let me go and he was laughing, he had a feeling he was God himself. He didn't care about anything human. They don't need protection. If law didn't exist as a regulator of relations between men, the world would be a horrible place. Something like that school of yours that day. I know what I'm talking about, believe me. You have to look forward. Life can be beautiful, too. My life was beautiful when my father was alive. I hate make-up. I never wear make-up in real life. It feels like cheap and naive lie. But it's not a lie, ma'am. It's because of the light. With make-up on, you'll look like your real self. That's why we do it. So… - Is it okay if I continue? - Yeah. Listen Marijn, file a request for an immediate replacement of the interpreter. No, he's… he's excellent. Can you arrange a meeting with an officer from the Dutch battalion? Uh, yes, the peacekeepers. Mm-hm. And also, I want you to find somebody to go to Bosnia, to the village of Gologva immediately. I need information about certain white houses. You have an important witness. And finally you have a chance to reverse the outcome of the trial. The particularities are to remain within the Tribunal. Will you show him to the press? Is he a man or a woman? Proving the truth is a long and complex process. Often it's even painful. I've avoided public appearances over the last year and a half, because none of your colleagues ever asked the one and only question of importance: What do I truly believe in? What do you believe in? I believe in the supreme justice of law. That's my personal religion. And this is exactly the goal of this trial which I'm leading. Justice for the victims in Bosnia. The entire democratic world is hoping for justice. And a successful outcome of the trial, which you are entrusted to lead, but… I have been in Bosnia. I've seen the mothers in black. I saw the women who had to bury their husbands themselves. I held their hands. White… white house? School? Okay? Yes. We did separate them. But I don't know this boy. Do you know somebody in Bosnia, somebody who could look for someone's relatives. - If anyone has survived? - Yes, I know such people. I'm able to give you some information that could help. And you should know that money is of no importance. Uh… - Oops! - Sorry! Shit happens. Where was I? Uh… Uh, you should know that you will be paid for it. Uh, I'm a lawyer. It's important for the outcome of the case, I've been hired. I am from the Dutch Army, speciality "peacekeeping missions"! I didn't do it for the money, we went there to help! Then they started investigations, they wanted reports. It was a shame for Holland, but where was Holland then? People from America, from the CIA, they took pictures, every six hours. Uh, no, coffee. You can see on one of the pictures many men walking with their hands tied behind their backs. On the bank of a river, the same river we used to patrol. They say it was clearly visible. And then in the same picture six hours later, the men are gone. And the ground nearby is freshly dug. That's where they ended up. But I swear, we did not see anything. We did not even hear about it. - Cheers, Bart! - Fuck you! Do you know such people who can do what I'm asking for? Because it's… it's very important for me. Yes, I know such people. For a little money they can even recover a corpse. Give me two days. We agreed on a certain fee. They say they didn't get enough information. They didn't have enough time. No, no, no, I gave them the information I was able to. He knows that! But they had to make a lot of payments, and they won't give you the address if you don't pay in advance. All right. Is there any cash machine somewhere here? Fiko! What are they, Christians? Muslims? I have no idea. It's really hard to tell. Entire countries can't find a missing person, how come they can? They earn on people's grief, on death. - Are you from Sarajevo? - Yes. Since when haven't you been here? Almost a year, but for Sarajevo, it's a lot. A lot. Follow this road. I'll come to pick you up tomorrow morning, I can't wait here in the dark. Tell him the price stays the same. Jasna. Did I pronounce it correctly? Quite right. - Right, Jasna. - Yeah. Do I ask myself will we have a roof over our heads tonight or should I better not? Leave this to God, it's his job. - Sure? - Yeah. - What's so funny? - Well… Do you know where Lekić's house is? Alexander Lekić. Over there, the house at the back. There he lives. - The back house, over there. - Good, thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. What does she say? Just straight up. Hmm. What do you think? Good evening. This man is from abroad. He would like to talk to you. It's important. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Do you have a son? We have no money. They don't have any money. It's not for the money. This man is a Dutch lawyer. He paid some locals to find you. He thinks your son is alive. We've already paid twice to find him. They have paid twice to find him. Do you have a picture of your son? Do you have a picture of the boy? Everything remained in the house, after the war we couldn't find anything. We used to have lots of pictures. Does he have a picture of that boy? Do you have a picture of the boy? No, I don't. The boy is in prison in the Hague, the Netherlands. Taking pictures is not allowed there. The only way for you to check if it is your boy is to come with me to Holland. Don't worry about the money. He's certain it's your son. Does your son play football? Hi. I have the explicit verbal permission of the senior officer of the night shift to visit K-109. It will be for no more than ten minutes. Thank you. Please, remain seated. Do you like the food? Is it good? The food? Hmm. I… I just wanted to make sure that, uh, everything is all right for you. Do you understand me? No. No? No. You've got some… Thing… You've got some… Here. Well, have a nice evening… …and, uh… Good night. Cross yourself. Please. Here, try. Do you like it? Before the war, we had many animals. Cows, sheep, chicken. We were doing okay. We had everything we needed. I was thinking about buying a horse, too. I wanted a good one, but they were expensive. The war took all the animals. They died. Except for the horses. They reproduced. They mated as they pleased. Beautiful young horses were born. But they went completely wild. They don't want to be with us humans anymore. She wants to give you a present. You must accept it. She made it herself. They managed to preserve it throughout the war. Now she wants you to have it. Nice. Thank you. I… Is it okay if I take a picture, as a souvenir? Can I take a picture? - Well, okay. - So, yeah. If you can stand, maybe, there somewhere? Over there, please? Please. Smile! Cheese! Thanks for everything. He's a Christian and she's a Muslim, but they stayed together. I really hope this boy is their son. Now, I'm scared. What if it is not their son? Are you married? I had a brief marriage, but that was a long time ago. I haven't got children, if this is what you want to know. Nothing bad is going to happen to their son, right? You are not using him for you own sake, are you? Because, well, I trusted you. And these people are very kind. Are you going abroad? Yes, abroad. West? - West. - Lucky you. I could tell you haven't got children. It's always obvious. You people from the West are… more different. In what sense? Worse? You're more reserved, more quiet. More… polite, - more balanced, more… - Boring? Yeah. Well… You know? I am a grandson of emigrants. My grandfather came from Russia. He travelled half of Europe before settling in Sweden. My father was born somewhere along the way. My grandfather remained a foreigner. He never learned the language. I never met him, he died before I was born. I never had grandparents, neither. So I know how you feel. - Do you speak Russian? - No, not really. Unfortunately, no. What about your father? My father is, um… an old man. Did he speak Russian? - He did. - He did? - He should have taught you. - He should have. For what did you leave Sweden? Since my mother died, there was no reason to stay. This is Amsterdam. Amsterdam? Ajax? Johann Cruyff. Johan Neeskens. Barry Hulshoff, Ruud Krol, Arie Haan, Gerrie Mühren, - Johnny Rep… - Piet Schrijvers, Heinz Stuy and the Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles. The Twelve Apostles! True. - Good evening, Fanny. - Hello. Thanks for waiting. You've been very kind. You can take the hours off whenever it suits you best. It's no problem, Mr. Mikhail. This is Alexander, this is Fanny. Oh, you need a writer. A Nobel Prize-winner kind of writer to describe in words exactly how it is there… I thought about going to hotel, but it's impossible, he's terribly stressed… Don't smoke. Suddenly Marijn, I see this flat through his eyes. Jesus, why did we rent such a flat? Should I serve dinner? Oh, great. Uh, that would be all for tonight. You can go home. Thank you. Uh, and also, fill in a DNA analysis request. Uh-huh. But this has to stay absolutely secret. Yeah, yeah. One last thing, Marijn. Call Jasna and ask her if she can spend the morning with him. Tell her to take him to the place that Cruyff and his friends played. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. I saw the news, too. I was a little bit disappointed that Madame Melancholia hasn't noticed my absence. I'll sit here. No hungry? Hungry, no? Do you want some bread? Son. Son? Your son? Yes? Son. This is my father. Son? Oh, yes. I am his son. He is my father, Alexander. Father. Father. This is my father and my mother. Father and mother. - Mother? - Mother. Yeah. Please. How do you do? How do you do? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What is your name? My name is… Where are you from? I am from… I am from Bosnia. Lesson number two. How do you do? I couldn't even dream that I would come here. Ever. I still remember those games from '71, '72, '73. I remember them as if it was yesterday. I was in high school. I wasn't married yet. Actually, that's exactly when I first met my wife. You never know. My mum always says, "Man proposes, but God disposes." Listen, Jasna, while we were at home, in Bosnia, I wanted to ask you, what are you? - What do you mean, what am I? - Forgive me, please. That's okay, it's not a shame. No, if you don't want to say, it's okay. Well, it's not a secret. I… my case is like this. I was born in Germany, my parents used to work there. So, my brother was also born there. And my parents are Bosnians of Muslim origin. But they are not religious. We used to live in another country, with other people… And my folks didn't want to be different… When the war started, Mum and Dad suffered a lot. And they told us, once the war is over, we're going back home. So, last year we went home. But it was hell. Our people didn't accept us. Neighbours, relatives, no one. I can understand this, but… They suffered a lot and we just came like, when everything was over. I like it here. For me, it's not a problem. For my brother also. But my mum and dad… They suffer a lot. Hey Bosnia, dear Bosnia. Are we going to live long enough to forgive each other? You know… We let our son decide himself what he wants to be. No one forced him to do anything. You know, I'm not religious. I thought, if he accepts Allah, that's fine. Like his mother, I accepted her as she was. If he wants, I will accept him like that also. Today when you see him… In the end, I never learned if he believed in anything. Everything will be fine. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Everything will be fine. I order this session of the court to be "in camera." Judge May and Judge Kato will preside the session. I appeal to both sides for utmost efficiency since we have a few important hearings left, because we have reached an important stage in our work. The court has to make a decision on Milorad Krstić's case. At the end of the working day yesterday, the defendant's lawyer, Mr. Mikhail Finn, filed a request for a confrontation with a new witness. You may bring in witness K-109. You may now bring in witness B-179. Witness K-109, do you recognise the individual next to you? No. No? Witness K-109, are you sure? Yes. Witness B-179, do you recognise the individual next to you? Sit down, please! Sir, could you please sit down, this is a court room. Witness K-109, I will repeat my question. Do you recognise the individual next to you? He is my father. I request a break. I request a DNA test. This session is postponed until tomorrow. Would you like some water? My child is alive. K-109? My name is Miro. Pump. It was mere luck. I was unbelievably lucky. I need a drink, I need some time alone. I hate this excitement. The judge declared "in camera" before the confrontation. First I didn't register this, but on second thought, they hear what happened, don't you understand? Find the most experienced Bosnian lawyer working in Europe. Also… Can you take, uh… the man, our guest, I don't want to mention his name. Yes. Can you take him to your house? To some friend of yours? The journalists mustn't find him. Wonderful! This girl is a real gift, I must say. Thank her on my behalf. Tomorrow, I want you at the airport, to see him off. Find a way to offer him some money. Okay, bye. Good. Good, sweetie. Great, darling. Come here. You're good, aren't you? I'll be right back, my precious. Wait for me. - Hi. - Hi. Really? Didn't I tell you. And now what? Are you taking him with you? Now the lawyers have to arrange it. I gave blood for a paternity test. The results have to come in. His mother doesn't know yet. - All is well if he's well. - Most important is that he's alive. Don't worry about him, Marijn. I'll take care of him. Let me give you some money. - No way. - Yes, for tonight. And then some more, for later, as much as you need. That's not necessary. Will you wait for me to finish, I'll be back in 20 minutes. Wait for me over there. All right? - Bye. - Bye. It's so beautiful. It is beautiful, indeed. I was just thinking… While at home we were killing and burying each other… Here it's been like this all the time. Uh-huh. First, I would like to ask for a clarification, which I believe is important for the record. Does the code K-109 remain valid for the witness? Given the fact the court established that his identity was not real and that he's not called Deyan, but Miro? The change has been recorded and from now on the witness will be called Deyan-Miro in the record. - There won't be any ambiguity. - Thank you, Your Honour. Witness K-109… Have you ever seen my client? Have you met before? No. Sorry, can't hear you. Would you repeat your answer, please? No. Thank you. You were under oath in this court room. Still you said you knew him, and you had witnessed, participated together with him in criminal offences. Why is that? Weren't you afraid of the consequences this might have for your own self? Mr. Finn, I demand that you avoid questions that put psychological pressure on the witness. Answer the question. Why did you claim that you knew the defendant? That was the deal. The deal? What deal? Could you explain? They promised me. What did they promise? That they will bring me here. I wanted to come here. Who promised you that? That was my dream, to see it… Who promised you that? Some people came in the prison. We met, they chose me. Do I understand correctly. Somebody came to the prison in Sarajevo to offer you a deal, according to which you... Mr. Finn, stick to your questions. Questions, not implications. If you never met my client, then how did you recognise him? I've seen him on photos and videos. Did you receive instructions in prison? Overruled. What was your conviction in Sarajevo? For what reason were you… Overruled. It's irrelevant to the case. No further questions. Actually, there is one more. - What is your religion? - Irrelevant. I kindly ask the honourable court not to take into account witness K-109's previous statement nor the Prosecutor's indictments which are based on that statement for the decision on Milorad Krstić's case. Prosecutor? Do you have any questions? I request a new recess. I need to verify things, I need expertise, consultations… End of this session. Come in. Please, have a seat. Your office is so small. You want to know if I knew? I trusted them. I believed it. There were too many people involved. I spent two months investigating him… I trusted them. And they think they were helping me, and I wanted it to happen, so I… I trusted them. That's why. We'll have to move on. You know that, don't you? Do you think that they did it because I'm a woman? That's irrelevant now. Your father was recognised in the whole world. He was such an authority. Thank you for coming. Have you decided what to do with the boy, Catherine? Krstić is a criminal. I wanted that man to be sentenced. - I was so close. - We'll have him sentenced in any case. Bonne soirée. I checked every possibility three times today with Roland. According to both the Tribunal and the Dutch constitution, they have to keep the boy here until there isn't any risk of persecution in his country. Whichever constitution they take, they have to abide… Yeah, I know, I know. The Bosnian lawyer arrives from Paris on Wednesday. I just sent her the ticket today. We're doing a brilliant job, just brilliant. Now it's time for you to get some sleep, okay? I'm not so sure. You did what you had to do. Tomorrow, we will feed all the information to the media. I will use our channels. We are going to make it very difficult for them. I felt almost schizophrenic today. I was more concerned about the boy than about my client. Remember, justice is on our side. Absolutely. No verdict could be based on a lie. You told me this. Jesus… I totally messed up this boy's life. And the lie is not exactly a lie… The dark forces of insomnia make me say such things. The night distorts things and depresses people and… Drinking didn't do any good either. Tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow will be a brighter day. Sorry for waking you up, Marijn. You're the closest person I got… tonight… in Holland. If I was in Lagrange's shoes, I would get rid of the boy immediately. We would like to visit K-109, please. You don't have an appointment for today. Oh, I know, but this is his father and he's… He came all the way from Bosnia. Yes, I'll go and see. - Please, wait over there. - Thank you. Next. - Can I take notes? - Yeah. Okay, good. Um… This young boy, two days after he turned 18, together with the entire football team, joined a paramilitary organisation. They enlisted as volunteers. He was given a job in the kitchen, and in the night of the 56th day, they moved and he got lost together with three other soldiers. They were caught and arrested. There was a trial and he got a ten-year sentence from the court of Sarajevo. Alexander Lekić. Yes. I'm sorry, he's not here anymore. Make it clear in your article that if the boy is brought back to Bosnia, his life would be in danger. He is right to be afraid to go back home, because indirectly, he has accused the authorities in Sarajevo. Moreover, he is a living proof that the cases were manipulated. Over there, as well as here. But the question remains, why doesn't the court prosecute him for perjury? Wait, wait! You're actually telling me, that this boy has been traded twice. This is perverted. I know your boss did everything possible to make this happen. Or am I wrong? Enjoy your meal. This is the first time Mr. Finn doesn't pick up his phone. It's not that, we bought the tickets. Tell me the truth, Marijn, why are they sending him back? Why don't they give him to his father? Mr. Finn is not at home, I just want to speak with him. He promised me. You'll come with us, won't you? I'm sorry, I… I won't be able to come, I've got tons to do. I'll call you as soon as I can. You mustn't be surprised that I didn't institute proceedings for perjury against the compromised witness K-109, as I have undeniable evidence that his newly-recruited lawyers want a new trial only to discredit this Tribunal. I have no intention whatsoever to cooperate to their efforts to undermine this highest legal authority. That's why I believe that we have to take all the measures needed to bring the witness back to the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina as soon as possible. Silence, please. My name is Lisa Robertson from NOS. Why is there no information on witness K-109 on the official website of the Tribunal? The Tribunal has the right to classify information. Here we deal with some of the most complex and difficult court cases. Those criminals violated the laws and customs of war. There was a genocide going on in Bosnia and I will not cease to repeat that this Tribunal's purpose of existence is supreme justice. But it's normal to meet temporary obstacles on the way to its achievement, but I can assure you, that these obstacles will not stop us. Do you think that you treated the witness according to the laws and customs of war? This is a very specific term and you're using it out of place. Then I have another question. Yes, please. Is the life of the compromised K-109 in danger? Killing for a cause can never justify the cause. It is always just killing. That is what I believe in, don't try to imply something else. But you are sacrificing him! Yes, you do! - Okay, last question. - Yes, you do! - Last question. - Over here. You from IRF, last question please. Thank you so much! Ms. Lagrange, have you read in Het Parole William Benning's article? I quote, "Does she remember she's a woman?" Now really, do you remember? We are living in times characterised by complete disorder of values. And, though my professional life requires severe restriction, I am a happy woman. I am a woman with a task, a real task. I am grateful that fate has chosen me for this. I'm flattered to believe that somehow I've deserved it. "If I can stop one heart from breaking, I shall not live in vain." "If I can ease one life the aching, or cool one pain, or help a fainting robin unto his nest again, I shall not live in vain." Emily Dickinson. Thank you all for your interest, this press conference is over. And have a nice day. Thank you, everyone. Welcome! We've been waiting for you. Talk to him. Talk to him. Don't think it's pointless. It's been a while. Hmm? I hope you're fine here. And that they take good care of you. You have to… Excuse me that I haven't been… I didn't have time to come and visit you. I've been very busy. Otherwise I'm fine. I'm still in the Hague and… And it's going well. Whatever "well" means, that is. Dad… It's Misha… Your son.
