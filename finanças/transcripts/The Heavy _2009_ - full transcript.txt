...the taxation, which in turn has led to an investigation of corporate policy. Our political correspondent Henry Holmes has the latest news from Westminster. Thank you, Richard. This shift in public perception has never been more apparent after the recent issues in the UK. One of the leading issues under scrutiny of course is the nationwide rise in violent crime... ...seen the dynamic rise of a number of MPs, not least Christian Mason. He is the leading proponent in the call for a general election. However, requests for a statement regarding the possibility of an election within the year have gone unanswered by Downing Street. Good morning, Tony. - Good morning, Boots. - How are you, mate? A nice morning for it. Hello. You all right, son? It's me. Ooh, you sound out of breath. You should get down to the gym more. Just saw Frank Marshall coming out of Hyde Park walking that mutt of his. I'll keep an eye on him, but get over here quick. He owes Mr. Anawalt money. And he wants it, all right? Get the money. Kick the shit out of him- the fat git. All right? See you later. Get out of the way. Boots, please don't do this to me, I beg you. I'm not a fighter, son. I'll give it to him tomorrow, I swear. You should have paid him yesterday, Frank. Yeah, but you know what I'm like. Please, I'm begging you, don't be like this. Oh, you fucker. Wait a minute! You know, Frank, I was a fan of yours. But you've really let yourself go. It's hard to miss this. Not exactly low-key, is it? Nice one, son. Cushty. Mr. Anawalt is gonna be very happy with you again. Another gold star in his little red book. Welcome to the Essential Mix with me, Pete Tong, where this week we bring you more action. Boots, you know a few things about clocks and watches and all that. But do you know anything about shooters? I know which end can ruin your day. Why? Why the fuck do you think? Might be a job. I ain't shooting nobody. Relax. You ain't got to take no one out. It's just for protection- you know, just for waving in front of someone's face if they get- Ain't my thing. Look, no one likes guns unless you're fucking holding one. - You're talking bollocks. - What? I've been raised with guns. I've had guns since I'm four years old. My father used to take us grouse shooting when I was a little boy. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Get much? - Yeah, I did. So you're like a crack shot then, eh? So about the job... I've told you- no guns. Oh for fuck's sake. Did someone say gun? Jesus. What the fuck happened to your face? Mitchell. Or do we call you Boots these days? Here, you two ladies on a date or something? Who the fuck are you calling a girl? - All right, sweetheart. - Oh, bollocks. All right, Dunn, leave it out, will you? There's nothing going on here that'll interest you. Unless of course you want to plant something. You insult my integrity, Boots. I thought I'd just stop to say hello, let you know I'm still looking out for you. Twat. Didn't get the impression that Prince Charming liked you very much. - He doesn't. - Did you see his face? I wouldn't want to meet him in a dark alley. Actually I would not want to meet the bastard - who did that to him in a dark alley. - It was me. What? I did that to him. She's just a fucking friend. You're fucking drunk again. - You're always fucking drunk. - Shut up. Just leave. Every time I fucking take you out, you're fucking drunk. What the fuck's the matter with you? Fuck you. He's closely followed by Peter O'Dell a longtime friend of Downing Street. Hi. Well, it looks like I've been left. Nathalie Marcel. Boots. Boots? So is the missus at home? What do you want to do? Hold on a second, mate. - Who the fuck is this? - Oh, Sean. Is this the reason you're so full of lip tonight? - It's not like that. - No? What's it like then? Oi! What's your fucking problem, mate? Are you deaf? Sean. Come on then. - Have a nice night, mate. - Have a fucking what? It's too late for that, mate. You should have thought about that before - you started chatting up my bird. - Here we go again. That's right, I'm talking to you, you fat fucking cunt. Boots, calm the fuck down. Come on, don't need any problems here, all right? You two lovebirds go home. Come on. You're a fucking cunt! Boots my dear, you don't have much luck with the ladies, do you? Good night. Mitchell. Dad. I need to talk to you. Really? And how'd you find me? Might just as well sit down. Would either of you boys want a drink? No, thank you. How's Mom? As good as can be expected. She misses you. Did she get my letters? Yes, she did. Did she read them? Yes, she did. But she never wrote back. I don't think she could admit to herself that you were really locked away. Answering your letters would have seemed like an acceptance of what you did. I'm her son. Not her only son, Mitchell. It didn't just happen to you, you know. We all of us suffered. So what do you want to talk about? Your brother. I don't have a brother. You came all this way to talk about a man who put me in prison? Christian did not send you to prison, Mitchell. You killed a man. He was only a character witness. He was the key witness for the prosecution. And how ironic- the MP so tough on crime, he testified against his own brother. What did you expect him to do? I expect some loyalty. He went out of his fucking way to testify against me. You murdered a man. No. I got into a drunken brawl with a man who was sleeping with my wife. And you killed him. Yes, I did. And don't you believe I haven't spent every minute of the last seven years wishing he didn't die, wishing that I could go back and change it. I lost my wife. I lost my little girl. I lost my fucking life. And above all, I was betrayed by my own family. Go and see Christian. He needs to talk to you. It will be a cold day in hell when I go and see Christian Mason. Your mother wants to see you... right after you've seen your brother. Yes. Don't hurt him. Just please don't hurt him. So you want to talk? Lot number 68 showing on my right- a fine and rare late 17th-century Thomas Tompion ebonized bracket clock. I have a lot of interest in this item and I can start the bidding at 100. 110, 120,000, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180... Fucking hell, bro, You proper outdone yourself on this one. - $200,000. - I thought it was a write-off. It ain't even finished yet. What's the reserve? 200 grand. - 210 on the phones. - So where is Anawalt? - 220 in the room. - He's upstairs. Wait wait. $230,000 on the phones. Could I pass you onto my associate, please? - Thank you very much. - Can you hold the line, sir? You, me old son, are going from the third division straight up to the premiership tonight. Come, let's go. Cheers, mate. Last chance at $260,000. I'd offer you one, Boots, but I want you to keep a clear head. Thanks for getting here so promptly. Short notice, I know, but I want you to represent me tonight, take a trip to South London. Visitors from abroad have some excess powder they're looking to shed. Two things I don't do- I don't play with snow and I don't go to South London. I don't think this is the kind of job I'm suitable for, Mr. Anawalt. I'm sure Rubin will be better. What's the matter, Boots? You're normally keen as mustard to serve my will. When I came to London, I did whatever I had to do to get on the giving end of the stream of piss that hits us all at some point. I made it easy on you. Don't ever forget that. And you know my record. Collecting's one thing. This- I'm sorry. I'm sure these gentlemen want as limited trouble as we do. They're tricky bastards. The last thing they want is to fuck with a respectable West End businessman like myself. It really is a question of "Hello. How do you do? This is mine. That's yours. Have a nice evening. " Besides, I don't think our agreement includes a backchat clause. What the fuck are you laughing at? Come. You all right, son? You bring this home it'll be a white Christmas for all of us. Should be enough. You know where you're going? Yep. Don't fuck this up. Shut up, Rubin. Have a good day at work, dear. Anawalt? Nope. He sent me. You're with Anawalt? I have something for you. Huh. Oh, you do, do you? Yeah. What's Anawalt doing, eh? Sending an amateur to an introduction meeting? He don't want to do business? Of course he wants to do business. He just figured this was the kind of meeting best suited for me. Oh yeah? What type of meeting is that? The kind that brings us to this shithole at midnight. Now I don't know about you fellas, but I don't really feel like going to prison tonight. Okay okay, where's the money? Where's the gear? Randall. Okay? Now the money. Oi! Let's go! We don't have all night. Come on. Don't have all night. What the fuck are you playing at? Easy. Easy. Easy. Now listen, son. Don't- I really won't ask you again. Claire. It's nice to meet you, Claire. You live here alone? Yes. Just you and this cat, right? Yes. Are we expecting any visitors tonight? Hmm? I thought I was. See, there wasn't supposed to be anyone here. So what I want to know now is who else is gonna show up? What other little surprises can I expect? Huh? Claire? He's not coming. He's not coming. Okay, Claire. Understand this, okay? You need to tell me the truth. I can be very disagreeable with people who lie to me. Are you sure you're telling me the truth? Yes. Are you gonna kill me? Clearly the financial regulator has ended its investigation into the short-selling of HDTS shares despite repeated attacks on the bank that last week pushed its stock price below the level of a planned rights issue. He's back. What's that look all about? You set me up. Watch your mouth, Mitchell Mason. What the fuck was that? Boots, calm down. You never said anything about killing anybody. They're dead? Well, there goes repeat business. I didn't get the impression they were there to do fucking repeat business. - You sure about that? - Yeah, I'm fucking sure. And you knew. That's why you wasn't there. - Fuck off, Mitchell. - Don't push me. - All right, all right. - Fuck off, Mitchell. Enough! Enough. Rubin, I'd like a word with Boots alone. Bring me that... Very very very good. You've outdone yourself. And you fucking set me up and now there's three dead people in a warehouse. And I'm not going back to prison. You won't, Boots. It's all fine. You're completely protected. Nobody's gonna send you back to prison. That's fucking dogshit, Anawalt. Listen to me, you little fuck. I could drop you right now and it wouldn't mean shit to me. I'm the person who got you out of prison in the first place, remember? You'd have rotted like a sack of shit in there if I hadn't pulled the strings. Understand me, Mason. You'll do exactly what I tell you to do. And you'll do it with a fucking smile. You belong to me until I tell you otherwise. And Mason, it's Mr. Anawalt to you. Thank you. In any case, all that doesn't matter now. I'll hate to lose you. What do you mean? - I mean, that's it. We're done. - What? Yes, after this last job you are a truly free man. What is it? It's $75,000 is what it is. $75,000 for what? Upfront. Enough to get you out of here, start a new life. And what is it? Be very clear, Boots: you take the file, you take the job. You don't normally start this early. You look like shit. Here, have a sip of this. Are you okay? Not really. What's been going on? You don't want to know. For Christ's sake, what have you done this time? Nothing yet. Can't you just keep yourself out of trouble? Trouble just seems to follow me around. Don't give me that shit. It's not anyone else's fault but your own. You've got to just try and get your life back together. You know, I didn't want to get involved in this shit. I just wanted to pay my debt and leave. Boots, what is it? Something very very heavy. Of course. Well, I'll- I'll be there later. Mm-hmm. Not really. - Mr. Mason. - Yes? Mr. Mason is here to see you. Oh, send him right in. I've got to go. I'll call you right back. Mitch. Welcome to my humble abode. Uh, would you like something to drink? I have coffee, tea, water. Whiskey sounds good. Certainly. It's so good to see you. Have a seat. Been a long time. So I believe we need to talk. Yes, we do. How have you been? What do you want, Christian? I was so sorry to hear about what happened to your little one. Did you get my note? I know they didn't catch the driver, Mitch- that bastard. I can't even imagine how you must have felt. I'm so sorry. You're sorry? You're the reason I wasn't there. Mitch. Don't ever talk to me about my daughter again. Don't you ever even mention Isabella's name. Now what is it you want, Christian? I don't know how to tell you this, but I need you to see a doctor. Why? I have a medical condition that might also affect you. See, I'm dying. It's a condition called dilated cardiomyopathy- an enlargement and weakening of the heart. And it's genetic. Turns out our grandfather had it too. And there's a strong chance you might have it. Is there a cure? There are treatments, but no, no cure. You need to get tested right away. You can see my doctor, on me. Mitch, if there's ever a time to let bad blood between us pass, it's now. Forget what I did. I can certainly forget what you did. But it's not about that. It's about flesh and blood. So how long have you got? A few months. He's expecting your call. So what if I do have it? Well, with today's sophisticated surgery and a quality treatment, a man can live a long and full life. Christian said there's no cure. Christian's case is slightly unique in that he has a rare blood and tissue type. His body would reject most heart transplants. But- thank you, Sita. But it's not all gloom and doom. With a good match, a transplant would be very successful. And it's all looking good so far, Mr. Mason. We just need to check you in - for donor profile testing. - What are you talking about? Didn't Christian speak to you about this? No. Mr. Mason, bone marrow and platelet donation could keep Christian alive that much longer. I don't know what you're saying, Doctor. If you would agree to be your brother's donor, that means you would keep him alive long enough for us to find a perfect matching heart. Now the process is not easy. I have to be totally honest with you, it is excruciatingly painful. Perhaps you should go away and think about it. We should have your results back in a day or two. Respectfully, Doctor, I don't care what you have for me in a day or two. And as far as my brother goes, I wouldn't piss on him if he was on fire. Get over here! Fucking motherfucker! Get over here! You fuck! Look, I don't want to piss you off, but you can have anything you want. You can take anything- jewelry, money- anything. Just take all of it. I don't want anything from you. Why are you here? You don't want to know. You fucking- fucking cunt! Fucking- is this fucking it? You bugger! You see this fucking eye? Blinded, Boots! Get out of that, son. Come on. Come back in an hour. We're not open yet. - Yeah, I know. - If you know, come back later. No need to, sweetheart. What can I do for you? Mitchell Mason, a punter of yours. Boots? The piece of shit that sits here every night. How pleasant. What about him? You wouldn't happen to know what sort of shit he's got himself into these days, would you? See, I've got a hunch he's getting himself into something serious. And he ain't said nothing to you, no? 'Cause I know you're his fairy godbitch. Call me a solicitor, or a counselor if you like. What goes in here stays in here. Argh! No CCTV cameras in here, eh? That's a bit stupid, isn't it? You know, in most armed-robbery cases it's the leading source of information. Hmm? Have I got your attention? Has he mentioned anything? Do it as soon as. Cheers, Reg. Your doctor called, asked if you could ring him back as soon as possible. Sign, please. Your dad called... - Mm-hmm? - ... asked the same. Tell him I'll call him right back. I need these three things faxed, please. Thank you, Frances. Okay. Dr. Heidleman's office. Uh, Dr. Heidleman, please. Your name, please. Christian Mason. Christian. Thank you. - Frances. - Yes, Mr. Mason? Get my father on the phone, would you? Right away, Mr. Mason. Can I help you? I doubt it. Ah, you're... Boots's friend. Hello, sweetheart. Where's Anawalt? See, he's a busy man. Do you have an appointment? Excuse me? You're excused. Get out of my fucking way. Ooh, a clusterfuck of testosterone. Listen, you tell Anawalt I want to see him on police business. Or if he prefers, I can bring back a warrant. Mr. Anawalt, I'll be outside if you need me. Mr. Dunn. How lovely. Can I get you something? - Try one of these? - By all means. How can I be of help to you? - Boots Mason. - Yes? What the fuck are these? Oh, they're clove cigarettes. Sorry I didn't mention it. They're all-natural. I find they leave you with a nicer-smelling breath. So Boots Mason, he works for you, right? And let me start by saying any information you give me here today is of course off the record. Of course. So why would a seemingly legit businessman like yourself employ such a shithouse like him? Boots comes in very handy as a debt collector, Mr. Dunn. A bailiff, if you like. So just small jobs? Nothing too big? Well, this is what I do for a rather nice living. There are no small jobs. Why don't I just cut to the chase, Anawalt? Why don't you? There's a contract out on Christian Mason. Who and when, Mr. Anawalt? Christian Mason the politician? You know exactly who I'm talking about. Mr. Dunn, I give you my word I know nothing of this contract. Do me a favor, Anawalt- trafficking, arms dealing, money laundering? If there's a contract out on Christian Mason, you would know about it. You are a criminal in a bespoke suit. Now I'm pretty sure that you've been offered this job. And I'm pretty sure that you will offer it to Boots. Boots won't even touch guns. As for myself, I rather like Christian Mason. I like what he's planning to do with my taxes. I want him to be prime minister. I certainly don't want him taken out. There's no real intelligence on the ground. There's just all this mighty military hardware. Absolutely. UN troops pledges that they'll be in place within two to three days. But the support workers are saying it's impossible to function properly under these conditions. Can I ask you a question? No. Have you spent time in prison? Yeah. What for? I got nicked. For? Well, the first time I- I got in a situation, um... someone got in my face. I was very young. I was scared. Next thing I know, I'm smashing his head through the windshield of a car. Oh. Wait, you said the first time. - Excuse me? - You said the first time. Prison- you've been more than once. Been twice. What happened? I killed someone. You killed somebody? Yeah. I killed my wife's lover. Dr. Heidleman's office. Yes, Dr. Heidleman, please. May I ask who's calling, please? - I'm sorry? - Your name, please. Boots Mason. Thank you. Mr. Mason, very very good news. All's clear. Not a trace in sight. Thank you very much, Doctor. Have you given any more thought to what we discussed? Yes, I've thought about it. Bet you'd like another shot at me, wouldn't you, Boots? I'm gonna make you pay for this for the rest of your days. Fuck you, Dunn. I've paid already. You put me away twice. What do you want from me? I want you to suffer. I want you to suffer like I've suffered. Do you know what you've cost me? Every day I look in the mirror I see your face. I'm on to you. I'm on to you, Mason. I know you're involved with this plot to kill your brother. And I'm gonna bring you down. I don't know what you're talking- Do you know what a Columbian necktie is, Boots? It's when I slit your throat from eat to ear and then I pull your tongue through the opening. Problem? No. What's all that about? Same old shit, Tony. See you tomorrow. Wave to Daddy. Thanks for coming. - Let's go to my office. - And you are? Uh, if you don't mind, could you excuse us, darling? Oh, I'm gonna order a takeaway. - Okay, that's great. - Something spicy. Yes, fabulous. - Was I correct? - I'm not sure. I've checked on Anawalt like you asked, but I don't think he knows anything. Detective, someone wants me dead and Anawalt knows who it is. Well, I've checked up on it and I think he's tight. Listen, Dunn, everyone knows Jameson Anawalt is a very smart man. If he isn't behind this he certainly knows who is. Maybe you should go back there and change your tactics. There's a reason I hired you for this, Dunn. You have a reputation for making things happen. And I need this sorted tonight. I'm about to announce that I'm standing for party leader tomorrow. I don't need this shit. I need some sleep. Sort it out. - Okay. - Tonight. Well, I have a hunch it might be a bit closer to home than you think. Who? Your brother. Listen, I know you have a history with him, but I don't want you to get your head clouded on this one. You should follow up with Anawalt like I told you. There might even be a promotion in it for you. Okay, consider it done. Have a seat, Dunn. Excuse me? Uh, take a seat. I need to ask you something. If someone were to shoot me, where would they aim for? In cases like this, normally a headshot. That's what I would do. Then that's what I want you to do, to whoever's behind this. Blow their head off. Make sure you call me when this is sorted. - I'll see myself out. - Right. Thank you... Dunn. She's in the kitchen. Mitchell. Look at me. I must look dreadful. - I didn't know you were- - You look beautiful, Mom. It's hard to keep up with everything. This place is falling apart. Well, sit down. We had to cut that rose bush down. Nobody was trimming it. And the weeds have nearly covered that path that you laid. Do you remember that? Carrying all those stones. They must have been twice the size of you. I wrote you every day, Mom. Oh, Mitchell. I wish it could have been different. I didn't want it to turn out this way. I didn't want it to turn out this way either. Oh, Mitchell. I wish it didn't have to be you. What didn't have to be me? I know the operation is going to be painful. If there were any other way... Christian is out of his mind if he thinks I'm gonna do this for him. How can you be so selfish? Christian is going to die. My daughter died- Isabella. Remember? Your first grandchild. That wasn't Christian's fault. No? I should have been there. Christian needs you. And where was Christian when I needed him? I can't believe I'm hearing this from you. My son is going to die and you dare tell his mother that you won't do anything to save him? You know how it feels to lose a child and you want to put me through the same pain? You're not the person I brought into this world. Why are you doing this to us? Why am I doing this to you? Haven't we suffered enough at your hands? Haven't we paid enough of a price for your recklessness? I don't know who you are. I don't know. I don't know you. We've always stood as family. And if you don't do this thing for Christian, then- Then what? Then I only have one son. Goodbye, Mitchell. You know, Mitchell, you're lucky you're healthy, considering what you do to your body. All that drinking and God knows what else. Still... your ticker seems to be all right. Well done, Boots. Come pick up the kit. Easy. - Huh? - For fuck's sake. What's wrong with you? Whatever. Oooh. Ah. - All right, watch it. - What am I supposed to do with this? Chuck it and run, mate... if all else fails. Fuckin' hell. Can't wait to see this. Yes, hi, Bob. I just want to say that I don't know why people think Christian Mason is so cool. - Okay. - He wants to cut spending on the NHS. It's already a complete mess 'cause of lack of spending. And he doesn't give a damn about the education system. Personally, I'm not looking forward to living in a country where I can't get taken care of if I'm sick and where my children are uneducated. Well, you'd better get used to it, you mug. Hello. We're closed for the evening. Well, open up. It's Detective Inspector Dunn to see Mr. Anawalt. What? What do you want to see him for? I have some good news for him. All right. Hold on. All right, what's the good news? You opened the door. What? Fuck! Oh, fuck. Ow, my fucking leg! My fucking leg! Get off! Ow, fuck! Ow, my fucking leg. Ow ow! Oh please, let me go, man. Please, let me go! Ow, my fucking leg! Let me call you back. The cat's just dragged something in. Sorry to interrupt. Now fucking sit. Mr. Anawalt, he fucking shot me. Why are you so late? Very long day. Have you spoken to the doctor? Yes indeed. And? And I think everything's going to be just fine. Really? See? I told you it would. You got good taste, Mr. Anawalt. Let's see if you got good sense. I don't know what the hell you think you're doing or what you think I know, but you're making a very big mistake. Have you heard of the term avulse, Mr. Anawalt? It means to extract or separation, cutting or simply tearing off. Thanks for the English lesson. If I wanted to know something, I would use avulsion to extract it from you. Now I'll give you a definition. See if you can guess the word. A bodily sensation caused by acute discomfort, suffering and sharp physical distress. Now don't worry if you don't get it right the first time because between you we can have 19 more goes. You can make that 39 if you get me to take your shoes off. What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck you doing? You're fucking mad. That's what Lefty Thurlow said. Of course his first name was Bernard before he met me. Lesson number one. Who is going to kill Christian Mason and how? I don't know. Jesus Christ. Listen to me. You need to hear this and you need to hear this from me. Look around you. Take a very good look around you. Do you think there's anything you can do to me that hasn't been done before? How does a man who has nothing acquire something? In most cases he takes it. No ceremony, no posturing. Is that so? Without question. And how does a man with a lot to lose prevent himself from losing it? By keeping his fucking mouth shut. Don't you test me, guv. Test you? My friend, you have already failed the test. Whatever happens here tonight, I'll see you again... at the end of a long hard life. I'll be waiting for you! That's the difference between you and me. I realize that and you don't. ...over the last two years. Absolutely, and I think this is very worrying. I think everybody is going to be really watching this story. Now you've experienced this first hand, haven't you? Because your house has just been on the market. It has. It was on the market for six months. Six months? You know, the estate agent said to me, a year ago you would have had 20 viewings. Because yours was a very Des Res. Absolutely. We spent a lot of money doing it up. When you put it on the market, you were expecting it to go in a week. Absolutely. And things have really changed and I think everybody... Oh, I can't believe I fell asleep. What's your story? How do you mean? How did you take this turn in your life? How do you know my life took a turn? Maybe it was always this way. This may be my dream job. I don't know what your job is 'cause you're not telling me what your job is. Do you have kids? Not anymore. Not anymore? Let's just leave it there, okay? No, why not anymore? That's intense. Let it go. - You know what I think? - Who asked you to think? I think you don't even want to be here. You don't even look like you want to be here. You look miserable. You hate this life. You actually do want a family. I can tell. You want a family. You want a normal life. But you know what? Guess why you probably don't have a normal life. What kind of father is a father that has this job? Look what you're doing. - Ow, you fuck! Fucking cunt. - Wait! - You want to bite me? Come on. - Wait! Stop! Stop! - Get off! - Stop it! No, please don't! You want to go there? You want to go there? "Thank you, Mr. Frank. " "Thank you, Mr. Frank. " "Thank you, Mr. Frank. I am pleased to announce... " "Thank you, Mr. Frank. I'm thrilled to announce... " Any news from Dunn? Nothing yet. I'll tell you the moment I hear from him. The police are still doing a sweep of local buildings. Thank you. Could I have a moment, please? Where is he? Where is he?! Poor little fella didn't quite make it. You're... a fucking monster. Christian Mason is expected to announce his plans to stand for party leader in the next general election. The announcement is expected at midday from the steps of 100 Whitehall where the MP's offices are located. The highly regarded MP is the favorite as the UK's next leader. And with his ever-growing popularity... You're gonna kill Christian Mason. Are you gonna kill Christian Mason? Are you? Are you going to kill Christian Mason? Keep your voice down. Why don't you tell the fucking neighbors? You're gonna kill Christian Mason. You can't kill Christian Mason. He's a good man. What do you know about Christian Mason? - Why? - It's none of your fucking business. Wait a second. I'm gonna be a witness. I'm gonna be a witness to the murder. You're gonna have to kill me. You were gonna kill me all along. You have to. This is gonna keep you alive, my love, okay? Mommy, Daddy, brother, sister, Aunt Mabel. But I'll start with your sister. She's number one in your little address book. - I won't say anything, I promise. - Thank you. I need to go to the bathroom. No. I really need to go. Like I give a shit. Please. Want to take a piss, take it right there. You're disgusting. Disgusting disgusting disgusting. Want to go to the bathroom? Let's go to the fucking bathroom. I can go by myself. Oh! Thank you. You're welcome. Does it hurt? It's fine. How are you doing? Hmm? You okay? Yeah. I don't know. I really don't know. Psst. Who is it? Detective Inspector Dunn. Use your head. Use it. Good morning, miss. Sorry to bother you. Got a few questions I need to ask. Okay. Are you aware that Christian Mason will be making a brief appearance of the steps at 100 Whitehall which is just across the street? - No, I wasn't. - Really? Is everything okay? Yeah, it's just a routine inquiry of all the flats in the block. You haven't seen anybody creeping about looking suspicious, have you? - Um... - Yeah? No no. Everything's been normal. You don't mind if I have a look around, do you? No. You here alone, are you, love? Yes, I live alone. I didn't ask you that. I asked if you're alone. Yeah. I'm alone. Except for my cat. You know, I actually have to get going soon. So if there's anything that I can help you with... Detective? Whew. You like hot showers, do you? Yeah, I love hot showers. What's that? Sorry about that. It's for my music lessons. That's where I'm going. I do have to hurry. If you insist. Look, here's my card. If you see anything suspicious, give me a call. Okay. Absolutely, Edgar. What kind of lessons? - Pardon? - What kind of lessons? Trumpet. Maybe I'll come by later and watch you play. Have a good day. You got a dryer? I think he knows. There's nothing in it about being party leader. Well, that's your job, to make it sound magnanimous. Any news from Dunn? Not yet. Let's hope no news is good news. Do you realize what it is you're about to do? There's some things in life you just can't change. Christian Mason is gonna die anyway. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Christian Mason. Thank you, Mr. Frank. This is a proud moment for me and my family. And I'm thrilled to be standing here in front of you today to officially announce that I will be running for party leader. I truly believe that together we can bring about changes to our society that are so critical in Britain today. I'm looking forward to taking those challenges on; To fairly represent the people of this country no matter their creed, color or religious belief. Don't do it. Don't do it. Please don't do it. I am begging you not to do it. - Shh, sit down! - I am begging you not to- don't- That we strengthen our family values; To clamp down on the criminal elements. - Please. - No. Just shut up. You weren't even supposed to be here. I want our children to lead fruitful lives. What did you just say? I said shut up. No, you said... you said I wasn't supposed to be here. That's right. You could have saved us both a lot of trouble. ...mandates pass... I wasn't supposed to be here. We can create a safer and more stable environment for our children to grow up in. Only one person knew I would be. And we will together bring about a better and more brighter future for this country, a Britain that we can all be proud of. Thank you. God bless. He said something about wanting to celebrate. - Who said? - He wanted to celebrate with me. - I wasn't supposed to be here. - Who said? - Everybody that I knew- - Who said? Celebrate what? Second time's the charm, Boots. I knew you was here. I could see your shit piece of car outside. Oh, your mate Rubin, by the way, he squealed like a pig. Your little girlfriend can't lie for you this time. Turn around, Dunn. I don't shoot men in the back. Go on, put your gun down. So this is the way it is. As I always knew it would be. Please don't do this, you guys. Please. Shut up, Claire. All right, Dunn, what are you doing here? I'm here to stop you assassinating Christian Mason. You're full of shit. What? You set me up, right? You really have gone mad, Boots. You put out a contract and then you hired me to do the job. All this just to send me down. You're one sick fuck. Put that gun down. I said drop it! Leave her out of it, Dunn. You can't lie your way out of this one, Boots. Have I got your attention? You don't want to lose another one, Boots. Another what? Lovely little girl. You can change all this. - I'm not here for her. - Fuck you, Dunn. Fuck me? Don't you want to save the little girl? Just like you didn't save your daughter? Don't you talk about my daughter. Where was you, Boots? Oh yeah, you was in prison while she was face down in a pool of her own blood. Shut that mouth, Dunn. She was alone dying. She was calling out for you, Boots. Don't listen to him. Don't listen. It's not just another idle political promise. I promise you that. - Yes, Henry. - Thank you, Mr. Mason. I'm sure most would acknowledge that you've shown incredible stamina in managing your personal life with your political career. That's very true, but I was hoping that you would comment on a report that I've personally received today detailing your current medical condition. That's enough questions. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so proud of you. Are you okay? - You got to get out of here. - Yeah. Get up. Come on. Well, Christian, that's what I would call a result. I agree with you, my darling. Any sacrifice we've made in our life was well worth it to see at least one of our children succeed. Yes, you were fabulous, my dear. Give me your keys. You've got to go. You've got to get out of here. You've got to get out of here. Go! No, you have to go to a hospital. Claire, there's a dead policeman in your flat, remember? Now listen, you've got to get out of here. I'm not leaving you. I'm not leaving you. Listen to me. You weren't supposed to be here. You even said so yourself. I'll be fine. I've got a phone. I can call a doctor. But you must leave. Trust me. Okay? Listen listen. Okay okay. There's a building... Okay? Now you go and you never come back. - Okay. - Go! - Stop the car. - What is it? I forgot my pills. Something's been bothering you all day, Christian. You can tell us. We're your parents, for God's sake. - Yes, what's wrong? - It's nothing. I'll see you all at home. We'll have a lovely dinner together. I'm sure he'll be fine. He's just been very preoccupied lately. - Yeah. - I think things will be better now. - Did you mean that? - Mean what? About having only one successful son? I think I've always known the difference between the two. Haven't you? Hmm? I thought I did. I thought I did. Christian. So you figured you'd dispose of your brother and your mistress all at the same time, huh? Oh, save me the self-pity. You think this was easy for me? I didn't want her killed. But I couldn't have the affair brought out in public. Especially not now. So you take out a contract on yourself... and you think I'll get rid of the girl for you too, huh? No. I was hoping Dunn would've done that, thinking he was protecting the future prime minister. You, he was supposed to blow your head off. Oh well, not to worry. Father is going to consent to donate your heart. How low can you get, Christian? How low can I get? You fucking idiot. I'm dying. I need a heart. I came to you for help but you didn't want to help me. And where were you when I needed you, Christian, huh? You're my brother. You should have stood by me. If you murdered a man the only question I'd ever ask you is where do you want the fucker buried? I wouldn't have testified against you. You said, "Oh, he never could control his rage. " That was always your problem. You could never control your emotions. That's why you're lying here now. You know, you may as well have killed your own daughter. 'Cause you never did think of the consequences. You think there's a difference between us? Oh, there is a difference. See, I have a very important future in front of me. You? You're just gonna be another very bad memory. Time to end this, brother. Christian! Oh my God, look. "Standard. " "Evening Standard. " "Standard. " "Standard. "
