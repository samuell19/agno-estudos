We meteorologists call that a "cumulus" or a "cloudcluster". With that we mean a local group of clouds forming one big cloud. Imagine lots of little good-weather clouds in an air movement area forming one big massive cluster... A FAMILY OF THREE Go on, go on! Don't give up! Don't give up. Yes! Turn, great. No idea what we're doing here. These guys are all way too old. Are you allowed to swim with it yet? - Sure. What about yours? I'm not allowed. - Really? But your mom's cooler than mine. "You'll regret it later, you'll remember my words." Mom always "knows best". I won't regret it, never ever. - My mom is clueless. Are you mad? Man, this is so cold. I'll get you back! Come here! Come in! Elaine! It's no fun alone. Elaine, hello? Hop in. Now! - Let's go. What? Why? - I don't feel like swimming now. Okay. Isn't that your mom? - Who cares? Don't you want to say hello? - No, not now. Lars, it's your dad. I got your call. It's not okay to cancel last minute. Mom was looking forward to it. At least call her. Surely they give you a break from your shoot. Hi. - He's not coming? Are you hungry? Mom cooked us something. There will only be snacks there. Where is she? - She had to be there earlier. Something to do with the press. And leave the Rilke essay. She'll have a look at it. - Yes. I have to go to the office. Mom hung out something for you to wear. Elaine? Did you hear me? Yes. Love you! Andrea Dewenter has the type of voice we haven't heard for a while. It is so powerful that many wouldn't believe that it is the voice of a "simple housewife from Münster". Her book, seemingly just a story about a woman starting a new life is, with regard to its expressiveness, comparable to such important books as "A Room Of One's Own" by Virginia Woolf. That's what the critics say. But, as the mayor, let me say: Münster is proud of you! Well then... Thank you. Actually, I just wanted to say thank you to my family. I want to thank my two children and my husband, who left me the time and the space I needed in order to... write this book. Hello? Open the fucking door! - Yeah, open the door! Urban disco shit! I told you it wouldn't work out, but you wouldn't listen. It was your idea, too. I don't feel like waiting for the damn bus all night. Hi, we're only fifteen and we're out here all by ourselves... Pretty dangerous for little girls like us, isn't it? We're doing this study on male virility, in relation to their age. I read grey hair is a sign of high-level virility. They get this "karma". Only sex-wise, of course. Unbelievable! Hands off! - Like your dad. Come on! Then why don't you tell your potent dad to pick up the lawn-mower he lent me. Shit. Do you know him? I think he's our new neighbor. I don't know where... Are you going that way? Bye. - And congratulations. Thanks. Thank you for coming. I'll take the flowers. - Thanks. Bye. - Get home safe. It's better if I drive. I need my car tomorrow. Then I'll drive you and your car. ...the new single by the band Emma. And now, a totally different subject. A special cloud formation over the Dutch coast has made us talk about the weather more often lately. Our "Meteo Klaus" is going to explain what this means. The beltway would've been faster. Approaching the Münster area lately is, in fact, a very unusual weather combination. My colleagues call it a literal calm before the storm, because the phenomena... What... what are we doing here? She lives over there, doesn't she? Andrea, come on... Let's go home. Let us talk in peace. Okay? Tomorrow. Andrea! Andrea! ...the so-called Cloudcluster. The temperatures will remain steady. The weather will stay unpleasant for the next few hours. From East Frisia to the Lower Rhine we will be having some sunny spells and it will stay dry with clouds over Westphalia. The rain clouds are moving to the south east. In some places, heavy showers are... This is the Happy Family swinger club. Currently all lines are busy. You've misdialed or pressed your husband's redial button. Yes. Your father. Hi Daddy. Yes, of course I'm at home. Sorry about Merle. What's up? Hey, look, they're doing it on the kitchen table. It says "fuck". Your mom's book? - Merle, stop it! Wicked. - No, tell me. I want to know now. Elaine? Are you puking in there? Can't handle your alcohol. Here. See you tomorrow. I'm taking the book. "You have to come home. Mom is dead. Elaine" I can't open the jar. Are we having pickles for breakfast now? Don't you like them? When is Lars coming? Hello. Hi Christian. Did you have to change trains often? Why didn't you put the table in my room? She'd have had more space to work there. It's your room, isn't it? I haven't lived here for five years. - Six. We should eat something. I'm not hungry. Why was she alone in the car? Were you fighting again? Were you? - No. Why should we? I had too much to drink. I wanted to get some fresh air, so I walked home. Don't you want to get that? Dewenter. Yes. Her husband. My condolences. - Thank you. What's up? That was the last meal Mom cooked. Alright. Yes, I think we know where that is. Thank you, Mr. Börne. She is at the undertaker's now. How's the acting going? I can't stay long. We'll make sure the funeral is done quickly. Your mother put that there, she liked it. Mr. Dewenter. My sincere condolences. - Thank you. Benni. - Lars. My condolences. Are you running the business now? - Yes. My father can't do it anymore. You know, his hips... Yes. Maybe we should start with something concrete first. Should we start by choosing the coffin? - Yes. We call it "Final Furniture". That... sounds a bit nicer. What were you thinking of? Thinking of? Yes. That might be the right one. Massive oak, light finish. "Admiral". 6000 euros. It's really good, is it? - Yes. It's our top-notch coffin. It's very good wood with a very long life span. Life span? I thought you just buried it, this "Final Furniture". But we also have other models here. The "Senator". Also massive oak... What's that? Mom would have chosen that one. - You think so? She was far more classical, wasn't she? This is something very special. It's a new item in our range. No way. It looks like a UFO. - Is it biodegradable? It's the only one that suits her. That's what matters. Mom is to be buried decently. We'll take one of those at the front. Right. What will people think? It would be nice to find a coffin that suits the whole family. Say something, Lars. Yeah, what do you think, Lars? No idea what she'd prefer. - So let's take this one. Elaine, please. Cut the crap! Well, it's quite... ...red. - If you don't care what I think, I might as well go. Elaine... - Elaine, I... You let her go? - I'll get her. No, no. Leave her alone. It's okay. Well... What now? - Yes. Usually you take the coffin you think suits the deceased best and... Andrea was... I thought Elaine's idea... - I'm sorry! I thought it was clear what we want. - We? Here are some leaflets. Have a look and discuss it at home. Why? Christian knows exactly what we want. If you know it all, then you make the decisions. And don't call me Christian! Oak. The "Captain". - The "Admiral"? Sure? Yes. It's the most expensive, right? Yes. - He should have to pay. Lars? What about the inner lining? What? - There's more to come. Sit down. That's a nice badge you have there. From the gravediggers' union? Lars, I'm very sorry. We really liked Andrea. Babsi and I. Babsi and you? - Yes. Your mother told you, didn't she? And you? She said you're in the movies now. Tell me. Premieres, galas and all the stars. Yes, yes. It's going well. It's sad we're out of touch. I always have to... I always had to ask your mother how you're doing. I'm not in the mood for small talk. Yes, well... The next subject is whether she should wear a dress or just a plain shroud. What else is there? - Well, wreaths. Should it be a deep or a double grave? Music or not, death announcement. We'll work it out together. - Just make a list. Okay. Don't get lemon. Made you puke yesterday. I knew you'd skive school. We discussed curve sketching. I really needed you. We won't ever need that in real life. Right? Merle, about last night... - Hey, Francis. Listen... - Nice coat. May I ask you something? Have you ever screwed here? Let's go. - Or at least spanked your monkey? What do you want? - To know how often you can do it. Don't you want to be part of our study? All the others do! Wait a second. He's ideal. I read the book all night. I don't understand the kitchen table bit. Having sex in an elevator, car, shower: all much better than on a kitchen table. I'll have to ask your mother. - You can't anymore. She died in a car crash. Dead? How do you mean? Can we have a bag? - For that? You're kidding! Come on! - Do you collect Loyalty Hearts? We should've taken lemon. Lemon's a no go. About your mother... It must be awful, without a mother. I saw a movie: someone was in a coma for two years. Imagine that! They couldn't talk to him either. Geez, I'd be crying like shit. What are you doing here? I need a dress for Mom. For... For her to wear. I have no idea what she liked. Take a biodegradable one. Come on, help me. Please. How could she put up with all this? If I help you, will you sign the consent? To what? - A tattoo. Did Mom agree? - No. Will you? - No. In that case you can shove the dress up your ass. This is Andrea Dewenter's mailbox. Leave a message after the tone. Thank you. This is Andrea Dewenter's mailbox. Leave a message after the tone. Thank you. Wow. I just thought of a way to forget you. You were amazing. You too. I was talking about the concert. You were there? Why didn't you stay afterwards? Amsterdam called. I'm to audition tomorrow. For the Philharmonic. That's great. My father arranged it. I don't want to go. I'm happy here. I'm taking a shower. ...news from the Münster region. "Variably Cloudy" is the new novel by Andrea Dewenter. A great book recently awarded the Culture Prize of Münster. There will be no follow-up. Andrea Dewenter is dead. She died in a car crash... Asshole. What would you say if I came along to Amsterdam? What? We can make it there for breakfast before your audition. We have to fill up. - It should be full. I filled it yesterday. I'll go get a coffee then. Hey. Wake up. I have to tell you something. The accident near your house... That was my wife. Andrea had a lethal accident. What? And you come to me the day after... ...for a fuck? - No, I... I don't know. Maybe it's... I mean now we could... Somehow we have a chance now. - Now? Yes. You always give me the right thing at the wrong time. I... Go back to your family. For instance, we could look for a quote from the bible that your mother liked. Such as "Thou shalt not commit adultery"? Sorry. Can't you just say what you always say? Could you tell me something personal about her? The parish saw her as a loving wife and mother... Morning. - Morning. The parson wants to discuss the eulogy with us. Where's Dad? I was wondering the same. - Maybe at the office. Oh, come on. Can't you see what's going on? You have to see that. - Yes. But you don't. Where are you going? - To school. Elaine... Nobody expects you to, really. I could really use your help here now. Could you take these to the post office? - I don't have any money. Thank you. He'll be here any second. Merle? - Can I go to the toilet? Yes, go. Where were you? You didn't miss anything. I mean, when a guy is called Maria. Six at the latest! - Look at that! Is that his old man? What's the nerd doing? Hi. Hi. I'm very sorry for your loss. Thank you. How are you doing now? - How do you think she's doing? I don't know how I'm doing. Not so good. Sorry to hear that. Okay then, take care. Okay. Wacko. Merle, what are we doing? Fresh air is good for you. That's what my mom said. Just say, if you want to see the wacko. No, I just don't want to picnic now. You have to take your mind off it. My mom's words. It's nice here. - Merle, this is stupid. You could at least try. My mom's words, too. Just cry. It's okay. Yes, I know. But I don't do it on command. Merle... Come on, Merle. Stop it. We have a plan, don't we? What? Do you think it's a good idea? It's the wrong time. Our study is to find out who can have sex more often, young or old. You're in! What? - Please. Now what? - Now you finally do your damn study. My study? - What's going to happen now? Just a sec! - It's not so easy alone. It's so cold in here. So what were you thinking of? Can I touch your breast? Your study, your show. Okay. But just because your mom... You know... Now lift up your shirt. What are you waiting for? Have you started yet? You're sick. - She didn't do anything. You're Merle, right? - Elaine said you're an actor now. Can you give me an autograph? Come. What's wrong with you? What do you care? In fucking Berlin you didn't give a damn! It's not about you. It's about Mom. Without me she wouldn't get buried in 10 years. Dad's fucking around and you... - I don't want to hear that! I can't believe it. Don't you feel anything? What do you want me to feel then? What would you like? I don't know. Anything. You decide. - Do you have consent? Wanna quit? No, go ahead. You know it's forever. Maybe you'll regret it one day. - That's what Mom said, too. You haven't been living here very long. - No. Only since my mom left my dad. Why aren't you with her? - Because she didn't only leave Dad. But she's coming back? Don't you have to mail those soon? Can you lend me some cash? That's all I've got. Hold this a second. Trash it. Don't know him. Bowling club. She never went there. No contact. What was he thinking of? Trash it. Bad breath. Trash it. This one she called "Poison Gaby". Trash it. Done. My brother has no clue. Benjamin? Mr. Dewenter. Please excuse me. What can I do for you? Is there anything left to be done? We're taking care of everything. It's all fine. Lars has the list for everything else. Ah, yes. Sure. Do you want to take your wife's things with you? Yes? One moment. Thanks. Perhaps one more thing... Yes? - I don't want to intrude. But when you were choosing the coffin I saw that it isn't so easy with Lars and Elaine. And... - And what? When somebody dies as suddenly as Andrea, your wife, that's a shock you first have to come to terms with. In our experience it often helps the bereaved to see the deceased one more time. Like in a macabre public viewing? - We call it a laying-out. You can think about it. Sometimes it helps you to start mourning. What do you mean? That we aren't mourning? - No. Just think about it. - Thanks. I would be grateful if you stuck to just being the mortician. I am taking care of my family. Elaine? Lars? Yes, I... I have some sad news. Andrea had an accident. No... No, you can't visit her in hospital. She isn't there because... She's dead. I know, I'm very sorry that we didn't call any earlier. We'll manage. Thanks. Where were you? I'm here now. Where's Elaine? - Good question. I'd be worrying too. But you had better things to do than taking care of your daughter. I've arranged for a viewing. So that we can say good-bye to Mom. What? - Your sister and you had no chance to say good-bye. It's a good thing to do, believe me. As a family. So we can start mourning. - You sound like Benjamin. He used to call it a rip-off. And Elaine doesn't give a damn. What about you? - About me? Don't you give a damn either? Well? Hey. Where were you? I'm sorry. You're not sorry at all! You changed your mind. Good. - Thanks. Well, let's go inside. Take all the time you need. Is she in there? Shall we go in together? No. Alone, if at all. You don't have to be afraid. - We're not afraid. You and me together? I don't know. Come on. What's wrong? - Nothing. You have a tattoo? What's that? - She's old enough. Leave her alone. Your mom forbade it! - So what? Excuse me?! - Leave her alone! And you get down from your high horse! - Could you... try not to raise your voices? This is a place of peace. Maybe it's the wrong time. You can come in the evening. Or tomorrow morning. - No. It's okay. Everything's fine. - Okay. I'll be outside if you need me. So... can we go in now? Benjamin, it was nice of you to arrange this so fast. Thanks. I'm sorry that we... No. Grief has many faces and... anger is one of them. You can't force it. Really? Yes. It's all so unreal. I keep thinking Mom's just around the corner. Well, here that's actually true. No, I think I know what you mean. Are you okay? Is everything alright? I can't do it. Let's get out of here. Tomorrow is another day. Andrea Dewenter. You have four new messages. First message: I hope you aren't angry about my slip yesterday at the laudation. Mrs. Dewenter, I mean Andrea, I've read your book now. I actually found the time. You know, I'm always busy. Keep it up. And I was serious about the ice cream. I hope we'll have it someday. See you. Next message. Next message. Next message. Hi there, my little mermaid. I hope you had a nice evening. In my thoughts I was with you. I just wanted to say I love you very much. I can hardly wait to hold you in my arms again. Kisses. Dad?! This doesn't feel right. Have you lost your mind? Mom didn't want that! - She wanted just that. Fuck! You're completely crazy! Stop it! - Get lost! She isn't buried yet and you're fucking around! You're pathetic, Christian! Lars. Stay here! - No. I'm sorry. It won't work. Thanks. Hi. - Hi. I'm glad you're taking your mind off things. Don't you have any lemon here? - What? It needs lemon! - Really? It's fine as it is. - It isn't! It's not a gin and tonic without lemon. How can you live here? Because of the lemon? Because of the tackiness of it all. This is for the mortuary. Maybe you would like to go by there again. Well? - Great. And the next singer is Benjamin. Back in a minute. I should leave now. In big Berlin we always kiss twice. Shit, man! You can't behave like this, just 'cause you're grieving. Yeah. I'm not into your small-town hoochie. What's wrong, Lars? - Fuck off. I got it, okay? I'm a retarded country bumpkin. Yes? - But do you know what? I'd rather be a retarded bumpkin than a bitter asshole like you. You don't know anything about our life. Or about your mom's life. Ho, ho, ho! Benni. So carrying coffins has paid off, has it? I bet you haven't read her book. Fuck. Fuck off! So this is better than staying with us? - Don't you want breakfast? Why did you leave? You wouldn't understand. I don't understand a thing. You all think I'm a child. Well, you are. - I'm not. Do you know where we are? - Yes. This is where Dad moved when Mom found out he was cheating. And she sent me here with a suitcase full of ironed shirts. Why? So that he'd look neat at the office. You've seen it in the photo at home with the suitcase. I took it here. Right here. That was ages ago. Yes, the day I moved out, I came back, put the suitcase here and took the photo. I sent it to Mom, hoped it would make her leave him. But I was making it too complicated. But he never left us. He always came back. The past is gone. - He's a coward. He isn't. He never left us. Do you ever listen to yourself? You sound as if it were Mom's fault that she's... ...dead now. - You're crazy! Are you coming home now? Trainer Langhofe. - It's Ladies' Day today. Can I speak to Mr. Langhofe? He hasn't been here since the day before yesterday. He took some days off. A death in the family, I think. Is your father in? He's not answering his phone. He'll be here soon. Ah, yes. After all the funeral is tomorrow. What's it about? Because of the neighbors. You know, there's this custom... You ask... - No. It's customary. I... - I won't do that. We could ask Lars. About my mom's coffin... - God, you're still a child. Want to come in? - Could your husband help carry it? Hi, I... I already heard. You have to be strong now. Show no weakness. - Oh God. Come here. Poor thing... - I'll open a liqueur. Oh God. Your mom is better off where she is now. That's not very hard. Hi. I'm not hungry. I know Mom's at peace. I am very brave, and please no hugging. You alright? I need six guys to carry my mom's damn coffin. Want to come in first? - I don't care. Want a drink? Can I have a beer? Why not a vodka and a joint? - Alright, I'll take a Coke. Out without your friend today? Why are you here? - She's looking for men. Pallbearers. - I don't have a Coke. Hush! Thanks. Will he help carry the coffin? I'd better go now. It hurts, doesn't it? Well... There isn't much that helps. But I know what makes me feel good when I feel as bad as you. Francis? Is Elaine here? Her bike's out here. What are you doing here? - Merle. I thought you wanted to be alone. But I was wrong. You cut me out? - Bullshit. Let's go. It's our study! - That's bullshit. This is how our little cop lives. Cozy. Charming, your friend. Merle, cut it out! - You can leave if you want to. Your mind's only full of sex stuff. My mother is dead! All of a sudden your mom's dead. You didn't care before. You're just jealous of my tits. - Hey, hey, girls. Cool it. Know what, Merle? Fuck yourself! He misses my mom. And you? I do too. But it's different. I know she isn't coming back. Neither is mine. Aren't you mad at her? I think she's better off. Somehow she was never really happy with us. Go home. Wanker. I'd like to say something great to comfort you. You don't have to. - But I'd like to. When I was 11 and my hamster died he told me that everything is in circulation and nothing simply disappears. Everything is still there, just somewhere else. And in a different form. It's raining hamsters? Did it help you? - No. What helped? Nothing. There's a cure for everything... Aren't you Lars, the actor? And you're the musician? - Yes. I'm sorry about your mother. - About her death? Or that you betrayed her for years? I see. - What? You've already cast the parts. The evil mistress, the ruthless adulterer, the duped wife. Easy. Real people wouldn't fit your script. What did you want there? - To say farewell. Just like you. Did you know her? - No. Still, she became an important person to me. Now at least you have free reign. - No, I'm going to Amsterdam. Aren't you feeling well? - It's just the rain. Yes, sure. The storm is coming. - Looks like it. It's good. First I thought it was secondary literature. But there's more to it than just sex? I wouldn't know, Merle. I haven't read it. - Why not? Maybe I was afraid. - Of the sex scenes? Elaine inherited her talent. She writes great essays. Really sensitive. She gets an A, whatever she writes. Sometimes I think I'm too stupid for her. I know the feeling. My father is an asshole. Your father can't hurt anyone. That's a difference. Do you know how proud he is of you? - Yeah, sure. He has all your movies and watches them. He told me about them. Today I saw a really sad man. I'm sorry. Merle... Would you mind hugging me? Okay. I have to get inside. My parents are waiting. I'm sorry. Need the keys? You have never seen the plaintiff, Mr. Schünemann? Yes. I'm sure I have never seen her before. Never? He's the father of my children! I've never seen her before! She's not my type with her huge hooters. Kids are conceived lower down. So you deny being the father of both two-year-old Noel-Joe and one-year-old Layla-Michelle. I sure do. I have received this paternity report stating that you are the father... Now comes my favorite scene. ...with a probability of 99.8%. What do you say now? "Well, then I'll take them. And the new one too." That's what I call a spontaneous family reunion. Congratulations, Mr. Schünemann, you have... "Well, then I'll take them." No. "Well, then I'll take them. And the new one too." It's fine by me. I li... I like it... Hi. Hi, Elaine. - Hi. When does it start tomorrow? Half past ten. I'm off to bed. Good night. Good night. - Night. Dad? I think we have a call to make. My deep condolences, Christian. - Thanks. When you're ready, please. My God. Now we want to say farewell to our sister Andrea Dewenter. We do so in the belief in resurrection and ask Christ to receive her. Where is Elaine? She's not feeling well. Christ, shine for her... None of us are! Never, dear sisters and brothers, can you say everything about a... Hold on... - Christian. There are procedures... Don't you want to join us? You have to say good-bye to Mom, even if it hurts. You've even prepared something. I am so sorry. Why are you sorry? Mom wanted to leave us. She had another man. Me. If anything, she wanted to leave me. You know about it? Have you been bottling that up all this time? Mom had an accident. She would never have left you. - But she did. Why did you always pretend everything was okay? We must say farewell to Mom. We now take leave from our dear... - Excuse me. My daughter would like to say a few words. "Death is great. We are in his keep. Laughing and whole. When we feel deep In life, he dares weep Deep in our soul." It's by Rainer Maria Rilke. I had to write an essay about him for school. I didn't understand the poem. I asked you and you said, some things can't be understood until they are experienced. Until then, trust someone who is experienced. You said that's what mothers are there for. My mother had an affair. - What? She loved another man. And I can't understand it. Now I know what Rilke meant. And I'll understand her too one day. But it's so hard without you, Mom. We commit the body to the earth. Christ, who rose from the dead, will also raise you up, Andrea Dewenter. From dust you came, to dust you will return. Yet the Lord will resurrect you. Our Lord Jesus yields resurrection and salvation. The peace of the Lord be with you. Maybe... we could do something together next time. Yes. Yes. It's your mother's book. Read it. There's nothing bad inside. And a CD. Don't laugh. I recorded a song for you. - Thanks. My condolences. Thanks. Does it still hurt? What? - Your tattoo. Can I see it? Go on! - No. I'm your brother. - So? Come on, show me. - No. I'll see it one day anyway. It's cute. Walk me to the station?
