Our chat here is only the teaser of a movie. If it continues, it may be a great love story. I believe that it'll be erotic in genre. All were waiting for you for dinner yesterday. I'm sure you must have been with the concubine. Kidding! I was busy in the office. You'd have to show up. Yesterday was your anniversary! You'd have shown up! She is so foolish to believe you're having no affair! If I were she, I'd never have trusted you. Although she is getting more and more foolish. You'd not keep a mistress with you, that's too much. Wife is like clothes. I just want some for change! Like you, you treat the girls like dirty socks. You change them everyday. Bullshit! I seldom wear socks! But I tell you... women are like eggs. It's doing exercise. Stir and eat, when it's fresh. Don't waste any of it. Do you have any responsibility to the girls? Courting girls need no responsibility. But tactics! Just like in a battle, I'll win. But I'll never keep those refugees. Foon, men should have a stable family, men'd marry. I support the marriage whole heartedly. A man once married, should be a loyal perfect husband. Listened? So I don't want to marry! Creeper! No, I'm lewd! Sure you are. You've a good wife but still want to have affair. Put whatever rubbish in your mouth. Look at you, a lustful wolf! Beware of AIDS. Do you understand what are moralities? Do you feel guilty? Why don't You marry? Giving birth to babies are too painful! I wanted to give you a ride. But it's too cool of you to take a taxi. A motorcycle is too dangerous! My life is so precious! Isn't it safe to take a taxi? Sure, as safe as condom! Damn you! I don't want you to play so childish in the Centre. I do want her to hit me. Bitch and wolf! Good morning class. Traffic jam I guess! Well, we'll wait them. No sir, they've attended another class. You really love my floral arrangement. I do want to change. But I'm not qualified. You can remove the blood after drinking some water. Headmaster. A female teacher is having sex disturbance to the girls. She tortures them. To balance herself. Really? She is the new teacher Leung Mo-Shang. If you don't believe, go up to the class 10 minutes later. I'll prove it. 10 minutes, remember! Anybody wants a try? I'll do it! I've paid the class fee. Welcome! How is the floral arrangement class? Closed? No, just one day off. Well, I'll try my best to teach you. I know you would! Come on... You are lacking of male hormone. But it may be improved! Relax, relax... Isn't it that painful? Ready? Come up. Help him up, girls! Wait! Wait! Bitch, one strike is not enough! Have one more strike if you dare! Have some water! Any problem? I don't see any. Headmaster. I've been late for some business, are you okay? She tortured me. I haven't seen it. We did! Let's go. Headmaster, I... You cold-blooded! You are cruel. Mr. Shang's told me. It's true! I've been long waiting. Torture me! Hit me, come on baby! Come on! You bitch! I wonder her address is a fake one. She is like the poster model. Pretty woman? Look at your dress-up. You made me feel too disappointed! Miss Ho, what a coincidence. Yeah. The teaser is over. Now, it'd come to the content. You have just seen "Pretty Woman", right? Yes, it's a perfect film. I appreciate so much about the straightness of the actress. What a coincidence, because I appreciate Richard Gere. Really! But I can't find anything that you are like him. No! At least one thing. What? We love wearing suit and tie in anytime. Really? Yeah! Would you like to go and see something with me? I won't if it's not related to the romance of movie. So you have to go, cause I've to bring you to see, Some props usually found in the Hollywood film. Although it's quite old, it's kept well. Props? Where is it? It appears! In many great love movies, romance happened under the moon. It's too romantic! Do you remember any movie? "The wolf". What are you doing? Nothing special. It's "Casablanca". Really? Bulgar kissed Ingrid under the moon. In a Hitchcock's film "To Catch a Thief", Grace's first kiss is taken by Terry Grand, under the same moon. Now, in such circumstance. I think we can't avoid... I'm not easy to get in. I'm! Oh no, I'm not too. Still, we've a gap between us. It can be removed. Now, close your eyes, deep breathe. Enjoy the moon light. Isn't it "moon light"? We've gap, see? Never mind, the gap is over. I just give you one chance. And I'll go to Tokyo tomorrow morning. Tokyo? What for? For Tokyo Film Festival, and to learn something. Let's see if we'll meet again. Miss Ho, do you still need this? Well, I'll take it. Room 304? Thank you. Hello. Miss Holliyok. Foon? Are you giving me long distance call? I miss you, are you missing me? Me too!

Foon, it made me so excited. And so happy! One word... Great! Isn't it out of your expectation? Come in. Foon! Excited? Happy? "Pretty Woman" is cut. What's be changed? "Ghost"! Oh no! Fantastic! Can we try once more? My pleasure! See. Another one defeated, by my "The Double Inverted Eiffel Tower Kissing Technique". The theme song of "Ghost" would be our song now. Whenever I hear this, I'll remember how you kissed me. Every time I hear it, I'll remember how you rape me. Go to hell. You are mine only. Sure, sure. But... I have complicated sentiment. If one with complicated sentiment loves only one person, he'll be handicapped in love. If one is handicapped even you own him forever, it's useless. Listen to me. I've never loved a person so deeply. I give you everything. If you cheat me, I'll cut your dick off. Honey, don't talk to me like that. So, kiss me. If you kiss me now, you'd promise me that, you love me only. OK, OK. Next time, there may be a chance. Great! You'd not lie. Your students are threatened, they quit. The case is... I understand! - Last time... - Last time! He... You understand? Have you prepared... Resignation letter? No. I've prepared one, is it useful? No problem. Keep this for me please. I'm now going to kill Shang So. Kill his whole family, rape his dad, and I'll soon be back. Wait for me.

Let's go there and talk. Frankly speaking, the chance is limited. Unless he'll meet a great excitement, like large amount of blood flush to the brain. Then he may recover. What sort of symptoms he is having? Included... Depression. Paroxysm. Nervosity. Who is lustful? You are lustful! Who is lustful? I'm lustful. He is proud, indecent. He doesn't care morality. How dare you kiss your sister-in-law? That's it! He inclines to violence. Robbery, money no! I want your underwear. Your underwear only! What? You wear no underwear? Nervous before period.
