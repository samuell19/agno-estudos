I think it's pretty good. What do you think? I think she is beautiful. I wouldn't be so sure. - She is beautiful. - Are you sure? - You know better. - I hope so. What do you think? Do you notice any changes in your life? In my life nothing's changed. But around me everything's changing. Like what? The press. Television, radio. They began to talk about forbidden topics. The changes are happening gradually. But the people want faster and more radical measures. Vote for Yeltsin! And you came here, you bum, why are you photographing them? How old is she? Eighteen. Profession? I'm studying theater. Majoring in acting. Would you be embarassed to appear in an erotic film? No. Right now, no. Do they show erotic films in your college? No. Do they teach you love scenes, sex? Not yet. Maybe they'll introduce something new. You may get dressed. What's your name? My name is Svetlana Yerkova. How old are you? Twenty two. What's your ethnicity? Tatar. Why did you come with a baby? Because I have no one to leave him with. Thank you, you may go. We have nothing. No actresses, no working conditions. What the hell is this! - Calm down. - I can't, we're in barbaric country. This is terrible. You are right, this isn't France. And the conditions - terrible workspaces, disgusting hotel. Stupid actresses. I can't do this. Show me normal life here. This is a nightmare. We need to do something. We are staying at the National, the main hotel for guests of the capital. But what do we have? It's a real shock to me to see Russia like this. I've read about it many times in books. - It's so run down. - Don't be nervous. - How long is the way? - Around two hours. - I'll go crazy. - Relax, you'll really like this girl. - Do you know her well? - She's studying journalism. - That's good, I have hope. - And she has a cultured family. Nice people. - What's her name? - Yelena. She speaks French. Russian and, I think, German. Pretty? I think so. Sexy. I think she'll be good. I hope so because it's hard to find an actress without her help. I wonder, will she be ok with filming? Does she know what she's getting into? I don't think she'll decline. She's fairly liberated. I think that car is following us. I think so. Strange. No one knows us here. I don't know. I think everything's ok. I hope so, I'm nervous. Everything's fine. - Are we getting close? - Yes, almost there. This is a historic building. - What's historic about it? - A wall sized portrait of the leader. Is that a sign of historical significance? Yes. Come in here. What are you filming? In here. Let's go. Hello. My name is Yelena. Mr. Gregory. Hello. You will be working with him if you agree. Ok, let's see. - You speak French well. - Thank you, I'm trying. Wonderful. - Have you been to France? - Not yet. - Where did you learn the language? - In school. - In school? - Yes, why not? - Would you like to go to France? - Yes. - Alec, can you tell her? - I'm busy. I understand, but not everything. It will be about the sex life of Russians in the Soviet era. The sexual revolution, so to speak. - Are you interested? - Yes. So you are ready to come with us See women who will undress before the camera Translate everything. Do you agree? I think so. - Do you have anything French? - No. I mean a French outfit. A miniskirt. A miniskirt, yes. - How do you say miniskirt in Russian? - Miniyubka. Miniyubka. This film is about the love of a girl who is oppressed by the sexual prejudices of older generations. Have you encountered them? Really? No, I haven't. So you think sexuality in Russia is on the same level as in France? I think so. Then it will be easier to find liberated girls. - You understand? - Yes. - So there will not be problems? - Of course not. It's just if you think women are free of prejudices here you may have to change your mind. That's fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. - You being Russian is a plus. - Yes, I know. - And you don't know about prejudices. - No. - She doesn't know. You understand what we are talking about? - Yes. I understand everything but can't always express myself. So you don't always know what something is called. Yes. I think, like everyone, you understand the word 'sex' perfectly. - I hope it'll be nice to work together. - Sure. In any case, you aim is to be naked. Because every actor must be an exhibitionist. Your are probably right. I don't have an answer. Please, undress and try to be more expressive. Not bad. Sit down. What role would you like to play? In general, not just today. I woud like to play in romantic pieces. Maybe in innocent children's movies. Among tragedies I like the role of Jeanne D'Arc Let it go, ok? Thank you. All right, time to wrap up. Verzlikovskiy Way. - And how much is it? - 10 roubles. I'm in a rush, but get in. Get in. Do we have far to go? Yes, pretty far. You must be tired. Wouldn't it be easier to walk? No, I don't think so. It's not that close. - Is it expensive? - Well, not cheap. I think I can read what it is. Cinema. It says "Perestroika". Do you come here for entertainment? Yes, they show interesting movies here. We should go there, right? - I think I see an interesting subject. - Yes. I think there's something interesting there. What's that? I agree. How do you say casting in Russian? Yes. - You agree? - Yes. You agree, you like it? Yes. To be in an erotic film? No, ok. Ok, excuse me, I'll wait for your call. Of course, we'll call. Look at the phone. 143, that's Mosfilm. Is it tough to be a punk? Yeah, pretty tough. They say we are Tatars in our wide pants and beat us. We fight with them, walk around with axes. I have one with me. What's this? Thank you. Do people often come together like this for the holidays? Is there a strong feeling of unity? Yes, it's pretty common especially for major holidays. Will there be a speech? I think so. But I'm not sure. What is he talking about? Nothing in particular. That there have been big changes in the country. That have a big effect on our people That now our fate is in our hands. So the usual. Brainwashing. I don't know. All these changes are unusual for us. Life has changed a lot. But that's ok. It's Perestroika after all. You think that's good? Yes. I think it's more of a good thing. But there are many opponents. So it's not clear what will happen? Well, seems so. Look around, there are so many people. They are interested in the future, why shouldn't they take part in it. It's possible. Yes, you are right up to a point. But I am afraid only a few actually want that. Really. Why are you pushing? And why are you yelling at me? Loser. I think all these people are happy. I will try to explain to you how to act with Russian girls. First thing... ok, don't think I'm trying to teach you. No, I understand. French men have a lot to learn. I'll write it down. Ok, you shouldn't do this... I mean, come up and say You are so beautiful, you have incredible eyes. Unfortunately that scares away Russian girls. You have to keep a distance. The second thing. When you are talking to a girl Try to stay on neutral topics. The important thing, not a hint of romance. Our women think romance is already love. Well, something like that. How do you attract a girl? Just be polite, not clingy. Ok, so what should I do? Technique is the most important. - The technique of love? - Love and sex. We don't talk about it. Ok, this is the house we need. They are here. You are about to see everything. Wait a little. They don't seem happy to see us. Although, here they come. That's normal. - Hi. - Hi. I won't give him to you. Boris, nice to meet you. Hello, you speak English? - Yes. - Excellent. Do you think I can ask a question now? Would it be appropriate now? - I think so. - Really? - Yes. - Ok, let's go. Do you swallow when you put it in your mouth? What a conservative girl. Thanks. I didn't think that would happen. Russian women are very... forceful Should I translate what I said? Alyona, you are not a woman for bed. You are a woman for life. Such is life. Should we send in a translator? Let's speak French, like this gentleman. Translate. A translator in this state? No, I'm too embarassed. Although I could translate. Although, it won't be necessary. Boris, don't go with this girl. - Why? - You could get in trouble. Alyona, it's not your concern anymore. I'm so glad that I met you. - Go over the bridge, we are awaited. - Like usual. We are about to see it. What are you doing? Let me go. Let me go. Take it. Give it. Grab all of it - jeans, boots - they are worth a ton. - How old are you? - Eighteen. And how did you find out about us? I went to a concert and I was offered made me an offer that I come and appear in a film Now stand up. Go like this with your arms. Turn a little bit. So at my full-time job I'm a secretary. For my boss at the military commissariat. Take off the panties. Ok. Very cute. What's your name? My name is Nataly How old are you? I'm 19 What do you do? I am a salesperson at the department store Do you have a fiance? I have many. Miss, excuse me, can I take a look? 45 dollars How much is this red sweater? One fifty Awesome! - My old folks are in today so I can't - I can't either I tried to borrow the keys to my brother's apartment. How did you get this? I have skills. Through people you know? Maybe so. Would you take off your clothes so we could take a look at your body? Yes. We need you to walk around the chair. - Everyone's looking. - I don't care. This is called Soviet hospitality. They stripped off my clothes, took all my money and left me there. It happens. No, you don't understand. I lay there all night. And no one called the police. I told you so. You did, but she was pretty. - The blonde? - Yes. Don't make me laugh. The register is open, next order. You told me you had sex and so on in Soviet times. Tell me more. At eighteen. You are eighteen? I was eighteen. I was having sex with two partners. With two guys, at the same time? Well, the two of us began. And then we got drunk. We got curious and... it happened. Did you tell them how old you were? What's there to tell? 18 is old enough. Besides, we were a little drunk. So, no one was really asking. Do you regret it? What? That incident. No, what happened, happened. - So what's done is done? - Yeah. Do you think all men are the same? Or are there exceptions? There probably are. But Soviet women usually don't believe this. You say your women resemble men a little. Yes, of course. This is a part of our reality that you have to get used to. Still, you are treating me as a man. Women have it easier sometimes. Men make allowances for them. You have to learn to use it and enjoy it. That's what I think, anyway. You are very beautiful. What do you do? Right now I work in a modeling agency. A stylist helps me. I'm not a big fan of high fashion, pret-a-porter etc. I prefer the avant-garde. And our stylist tries to take that into account when working with me. The stylist prepares me to go out. He must pay attention to all the details of an outfit. He must help with everything, or else the image will not be complete. You must trust the stylist. I have a good stylist. What's your name? Katya. How old are you? Eighteen. Do you have a fiance? Yes, I'm getting married tomorrow. You don't mind taking your clothes off the day before the wedding? No. Marriages are sometimes based on profit, not love. The newlyweds don't want to live with their parents anymore. They want to live in their own place. And a wedding gives them that opportunity. Be happy! Guys, a lot of happiness to you! Kiss! Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. It's not always easy to live together. Because at first young couples live in communal apartments. Several families live in these kinds of apartments. Who share a kitchen, a shower and a toilet. Novoslabodskaya Station I'd like to introduce you to a photographer. He is famous for doing erotic photography. I think it'll be interesting for you. After all, it's your speciality. He is the best photographer in this field in Moscow. Many models dream of working with him. And he works only with the best. - Hi. - Hi. Boris, I told you. Leonid. Leonid, like Brezhnev, Leonid. It's not too cold for photos? Sure, it's cold but it's real. One of the girls is really beautiful. Yes, she is really outstanding. So, did that girl interest you? Yes. Do you really like her? She is so small. Small is not bad. You know better. Her name is Eugenia. - Yeah? Are you jealous? - A little. Should I tell you about her? Ok. She is dating a young man. His name is Sergei. He is a university student so they don't have enough money. So she earns as she can. And he is a speculator. Which is quite lucrative these days, but not safe. - And someone buys? - Yes. And he is not persecuted by the law? - Yes, it's dangerous but... - Got it. He also works with the deaf and dumb. He knows their language. Also buying and selling things that are best not shown to the authorities. But it's safer to work with these people. It's hard for everyone now. And this way he helps these people survive. What do you do? I'm an artist. What style do you work in? I work as a miniaturist. But for myself I do realism. Tanya, let's go. Do that first motion. Now take off everything. Now come out here and do that smooth motion. Now sit on the chair. Next. - Thanks, Oleg. - You are welcome. And I still don't have a single photo. We did everything we could.

I hope she'll work. What's her name. Eugenia. This girl works for us. I've seen her photos, they are simply marvelous. Relax. We'll see. We need to check out her acting skills. Bastard, how much more of this? Same thing for ten years. Why? Look at what I've become! What? Look at what you've made out of me. Out of all the girls they've seen so far you are the most attractive and you were selected. Do you have a passport? No. I have to say one more thing that we are not sure about Boris. I think it's better not to tell him about this decision because we have the impression that he is working for himself more than for us My god, what a lovely city. It's so unusual, so different from France. There are so many amazing historic monuments Do you know anything about the architecture of your city? No? I can definitely say that there's a Byzantine style, possibly Italian. Russian architecture is a beautiful combination of cultures. Just an amazing place. It's no surprise this country gave the world so many names. Alexey Tolstoy, Lev Tolstoy, Ivan Grozny. So many cultural personalities visited here. Contributed to the development of this city. And this country. Former wife with her grandfather You agree? Will you go to Paris? Yes, she agrees. He really wants you to go and play this role. Do you want to stay with him here? Of course it depends on you and your success but I hope we'll have a great relationship. You will like it, I'm sure. You have such beautiful eyes. They are like emeralds. Look at me. What is this called? Caviah? Caviar. Don't give me that, I can't stand it. As you wish. What? Deficit? (Ed. hard to find) Quite rare. Beauty eye. Really? My name...you...film. Tolstoy is your grandfather, right? No, dad. Boris, I don't understand anything. Night. In home - What? - You. Me? Where? Hotele. To the hotel, me? A whole lot of money. This is only enough for one taxi ride. A lot! That's one taxi ride. - Alyona. - Hi. - Are you all right? - Yes. Where's Eugenia? She left to give you a surprise. - For me? - Yes, for you. That's so nice. Yeah, very nice. I'm in shock. I told you how I was robbed and beaten. And here I am, I turn my head and I see that woman. I ran after her. But I couldn't catch her. How come? Next time. - Everything ok with you? - Yeah. Boris, you are always talking about women. About Eugenia, about the blonde. You never talk about me. I'm hurt, I'm no worse than them. Am I nothing to you? Does it upset you? Well, yeah. We never agreed to film or anything else. We had a business relationship. You are a big help. Ok. - Are you crying? - No. Everything's ok. What do you want from me? With my knowledge of various fields my language knowledge, I am always a translator Just a translator. And never anything more. And will never become anyone. So you had a chance? I don't know. I spoke, you listened. At your age everything is only beginning. Everything happens to other girls. You know, you are good at your job. You are the one who told me about Soviet women, their problems. I did. All the girls according to you weren't that great. Although it's kind of how it turned out. So why did you tell me that? Not all girls here are so bad. But the majority are. - And the young men? - Them too Everyone but you? Everyone but me. I'm great. Really? So you don't need love or money? I don't know. You don't know? Ok then. Everything will be all right. Better already? Everything's fine. That's nice. - Ok? - Yes. Yes, everything's fine. They did it to me Sergei, the important thing is it's all behind us. How are you? All right? - Yes, thank you. - No problem. How pretty. Come in, Boris, come in. Take off your jacket, I promised you a surprise. No Eugenia for you. Goodbye, Boris. Girls, girls! Leave. - What? - What you heard. - Who are you? - And who are you? Fuck off. You are going to fuck off. A day full of surprises. Yes, in a way. Don't I look like some celebrity? You do, very much. So put me in your movie.
