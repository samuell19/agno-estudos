(BIRDSONG) MAN: (OVER RADIO) ...element of surprise is the only tactic Gordon Brown has left. We'll be going live to Parliament. But first, more British troops are being deployed to Afghanistan as part of the biggest joint offensive... - (HORN BLARES) - ...since the 2001 invasion. The British Army's death toll has already exceeded that of Iraq and the Falklands War, with those wounded and requiring treatment at home also rising sharply. - Fatalities have ris... - (RADIO OFF) (OFFICER BARKS COMMANDS ON PARADE) SOLDIER: ID, please. I just popped into town. Private Shaw. Can you tell the young private who I am? SHAW: Sorry, ma'am. Increased security with the deployment tonight. I'm sure the MOD's very interested in the Colonel's supper. SHAW: What are you doing? Wake up, yeah? Do you realise who that was? Just get some wine. - (STORE BELL JANGLES) - Hello. Do we have any olive oil? Erm... we have oil. Oh. I went all the way into town, then forgot it. (CHUCKLES) - Go ahead. - Thank you, that's very kind. Erm... All right. Whole new world for you this time, Lisa, Sergeant-Major's wife. - Congratulations on the promotion. - Thank you very much. Lots of new responsibilities for you with the wives. Yeah. I'm sure you've got lots of ideas up your sleeve. - Oh, yeah. - Planning is key. OK, well, thank you for the advice. Any time. (SHUTS CASH TILL) (SOLDIER SHOUTS COMMAND) You not done yet? Grace came over to say goodbye. - Oh, right. Where's she going? - To live with her aunt off base. And have a life. There are positives to being surrounded by people who are in the same boat as you. Mum, please don't. SOLDIER: By the left! Left wheel! (BABY CRIES THROUGH MONITOR) MAN: He's coming to get him. Rargh! (BABY GRIZZLES AND LAUGHS) Come on, Billy, story time. Come on. BILLY: Are you going away tomorrow? MAN: I am, but only for a little bit, though, OK? BILLY: Who's gonna read stories when you're away? Oh, God, why are you so clumsy? Maybe this is God's way of telling us to put it in a frame. - No, I like it on the fridge. - It'd be better protected under glass. It would be frozen and formal. I prefer it where it lives, on the fridge, in amongst my postcards and my shopping lists and all my... my everyday things. Jamie always hated that photo. Said it made him look like an American talk show host. Well, I like it. - Fine. - Fine. Are you going to be OK when I'm gone? Mm. I'll be fine. Of course I will. I mean, it's my fifth tour. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, but things are completely different this time. Do you know? I think I'm going to offer my help in supporting the wives. I don't trust that Lisa, the new RSM's wife. She's very cavalier about the whole thing. - I'm sure she has a plan. - Mm. Not that she won't appreciate your support as well. MALC: Look after Mummy. If she gets upset, give her a hug. - BOY: I will. - OK, good boy. This is gonna keep you safe while I'm away. Just like mine'll keep me safe. Right, kids. OK, remember what we do with this? - Cross it off every day. - Yeah, until? - Daddy's home. - And we are? - Chuffed. - Chuffed. Chuffed, yeah. Yeah, I know. (LAUGHS) Check out the blast boxers. - Not funny, Red. - What? They're Kevlar. I'm just protecting the family jewels for your pleasure. - Who's she talking to? - I don't know. Better not be talking to those lads. - I was a lad once, remember? - Yeah, thanks. That's really helpful. Is that my razor? Are you packing my stuff up again before I've left? No. Well, I'm taking this. - Why? You're not gonna read it. - I am. It's about leadership. Fine. Last time you took War And Peace, spent your whole time reading Heat magazine and watching romcoms. Are you angry? No, I don't give a shit what you read. I'm just getting ready for another six months as a single mother. All right? There, you can forget about me now. Just get off. (SIGHS) Get off! Do you really want me to? No. Oh, shit! - Yes. (LAUGHS) - (KNOCK AT DOOR) Listen, I've got to go. Yeah, OK, I'll speak to you later. Bye-bye. You better write to me. And I mean proper letters, not just emails. (TUTS) Come here. They've stopped doing the jumbo crossword in the paper so I printed it off the net. No crossword? I've got to go. Right. Oh. - Hi, Kate. - Hello, Lisa. (GRUNTS) I'm late for a meeting with Crooks. - Forgot the clocks went forward. - Oh. (CHUCKLES) Well, don't worry about it. The Brigadier's still in there with him. Oh, great. Great. Quite right. I imagine the spouses are quite anxious. We all know what to expect this time. - Who's your point person? - Lisa Lawson is the RSM's wife, sir. She wasn't too chuffed to get the job but I think she'll rise to it. These things don't happen overnight. And Kate Barclay will help with the pastoral care. - Kate will? - Yes, sir. She volunteered. I think after losing Jamie on the last tour, she's keen to keep occupied. - (KNOCK AT DOOR) - Sorry to interrupt. - Kate. - Hello, Jeremy. CROOKS: The Brigadier and I were discussing the new welfare directives. Social activities, getting the women on board. Top brass telling us what to do. (CHUCKLES) I think I should leave you to it. - CROOKS: Oh... - No, that's all right. Got it. Colonel Barclay's wife would like to take a more active role in supporting the spouses during this deployment. Oh! I know it's not customary for the Colonel's wife to get her hands dirty... Yeah, exactly. That's my role. KATE: No, of course. Of course. So, erm... what do you have in store in terms of social activities? Well, we have our coffee mornings. Coffee mornings, yeah. And? Pot luck parties. Oh, pot luck party? That's when everyone brings a dish and gets drunk. Of course, we've got my walk on the moors. With the greatest respect, Kate, most women don't have a mess to drink in. They can't go into town and get pissed so they need somewhere to let off steam. - KATE: Absolutely. - Yeah. Absolutely. Erm... so, anything else? Why don't we just brainstorm with the women at the next coffee morning? Go and have a play, Bills. You can bring whatever cakes you want. I'll just introduce you to Annie and Helen. This is Sarah, Private Wheeler's wife. - Just marched in yesterday. - Are you settling in? Fine, yeah, except everyone keeps asking me what rank I am. What the hell is that? They look like squashed little turds. I think it's, erm... Kate's contribution. - (CUP IS TAPPED WITH SPOON) - Lisa seems to be running late. - She's here. - Hey. Oh, I'm sorry. - Would you like to come to the front? - No, you're grand. You don't want to kick things off? Well, it has kicked off. What do people do in these coffee mornings? I think they just... drink coffee. Sorry, everyone. Hello. If you'd all like to gather round and take a seat. There's no need to be shy. Front row's nice and empty. (CHUCKLES) So, some of you don't know me. I'm Kate Barclay, Colonel Barclay's wife. Today we need to come up with some exciting activities and pursuits for us to do while our service people are away. So, shall we start? Erm... Lisa? Lisa? Lisa? Do you think you could write things on the board for me? Thank you. So... I thought we could have a formal dinner once a month to explore all aspects of global cuisine. Then perhaps the film night could become a film season where we could examine the body of an auteur and would provide an educational aspect to leisure pursuits in a non-alcoholic environment. Non-alcoholic environment? (AMUSED LAUGHTER) - What's the matter? - LISA: No, no. It's just in general, when we watch films, you know, usually we like them to be... fun. - (LAUGHTER) - Perhaps open the ideas to the room? Yeah. Well, we did a book club in Germany. Book club, great, great. Super. What about a footie club? We had a cracking five-a-side in Aldershot, it was something else. Football! Yes, why not? - Start a needlework club. - KATE: Needlework, right. Baking or bread-making. Yeah. Yeah, and then we could collect alms for the poor and do a bit of basket weaving. (LAUGHTER) It's all a bit Little Women, isn't it? Let's just get the strippers in. Give the rear party soldiers a case of beer and have a Mr World contest. That'd be very entertaining. But, actually, right now, we're looking for clubs to join. What about singing? Singing? My bridesmaids did Angels by Robbie at my wedding. It was amazing. OK, erm... yeah. Super. A choir. Has anyone had any experience of running a choir? Lisa, you're musical, no? No, my mum used to teach music. But, I mean, choir's not really my thing. Right. Knitting? Knitting? Knitting. (CLACK OF KNITTING NEEDLES) Should we have invited Kate? I bet you she can knit. Ohh. You know this is supposed to take your mind off being upset? I just... I wanted to make something nice for Liam. I love wool, I love sheep. Any little mistakes give knitting character. Let's have a look. There you go, make a lovely... (CLEARS THROAT) tea cosy. - Or toilet roll cover. - Cos we all need one of those. I don't know how you lot can just makes jokes. I just feel sick all the time. Every time the phone rings, every time the doorbell goes. I feel sick. How do you cope? Do you not... talk about it? - Who wants some wine? - I'd love some wine. (BABBLE OF CHATTER) - Lisa, where are your glasses? - In the dishwasher. (MAN WHISTLES) All right, Frankie? Give us a smile! WOMAN: There you go. What? There are some benefits when they go away. I grow my pubes. It's like Sherwood Forest by the time Matt gets home. (LAUGHTER) And you don't have to brush your teeth. You don't have to pretend you like Top Gear. Today we're gonna be making some tea, and taking a look at the Brexar glass kettle. WOMAN: For today only, if you purchase the Brexar glass kettle, you also get this stunning five-piece knife set and wooden block. So clever and unique. It's the Brexar glass kettle. It takes tea-making to a whole new level. (PHONE BUZZES) - Yeah? - CROOKS: Hello, Kate. Comms are down. No further details at this time. But they've only just got there. Sat phone and internet on lockdown. I'll let you know when I hear further. Yeah. (BIRDSONG) - KATE: Hello. - Hiya. - Is your mum in? - Mum? So... how was knitting club? - There isn't a knitting club. - Yes, I've heard the joke. First rule of knitting club: "There is no knitting club." They disbanded last night due to impracticalities. Oh. - They can't knit. - Oh. Hi. Get a move on, you're gonna be late. Yeah? Comms are down. - What, already? - They're stuck in Green Zone. - They've got to tab out. - Do the women know? A text message has gone out. Best thing is to keep busy. MAN: (ON TV) ...possible bypass routes. We see first-hand for ourselves. While we're filming, a report comes in of another bombing close to the base. The Yorks Quick Reaction Force gets ready to move out. You all right? Just been scrambled because a suicide bomber - has just detonated his device... - Thank you. Gonna look good. (PHONE BUZZES) Sorry. Hello? No, I've not been in an accident. (DOOR BELL RINGS) - Hello. - Hi. I just thought I'd pop in and see how you're doing. Oh, OK. Thank you. Erm... Richard and I were also married last minute, pre-deployment. My family all thought I was pregnant, just being coy. Oh, are you? No, Liam just wanted me to be next of kin. You know, comms down doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's just the men aren't allowed to talk to us. The military want to ensure that no false information gets through. It's very important to keep busy. Less time to think about things. Yeah. I was actually thinking of decorating. Hm. It is a bit depressing, isn't it, the magnolia box? I was gonna do a, erm... a signature wall. And then pick out the purple in the other walls. Yeah, hm... it's a bit signature. It took Richard and I six coats of paint to cover up the mess I made when we first marched out. Oh, God, sorry, that's Liam. He always puts our teddies into different sexual positions, every time I leave the room. It's to make me laugh, he's done it since we were kids. Not "kids" kids, since we were 15. Let's get cracking on these boxes, shall we? I've got this exercise bike I need to finish. - OK, great. - (MESSAGE ALERTS PING) (EXHALES) (STIFLES SOB) Comms back on is a good thing! Mm, yeah, I know. Sorry. Aww! Come on. Don't be silly. Let's get some music on and get cracking, eh? (ANGELS PLAYING) Sorry. Thanks. (MUSIC OFF) (MORNING HAS BROKEN PLAYING) What have we got here? Erm... Probably just start with the instructions. - Here you go. - Let's have a look. Sprung in completeness Where His feet... Just give one of those to everyone. There should be enough. What you doing? Right, has everyone got a hymn sheet? - Time to liven up this coffee morning. - What's happening? I'm going to give you all a note. Then I'm going to count to three and we can start. So... (PLAYS NOTE) La-la-la-la-la-la One, two, three... Morning has broken Like the... Okay, I'll just... Everyone up. Come on, up your get. I'll start again. One, two, three... Morning has broken Like the first morning Blackbird has spoken Like the first bird (HOLDS NOTE FLATLY) Prai... OK, I'll just give you the note again. La-la-la-la-la One, two, three... Praise for the singing Praise for the morning (DISJOINTED) Praise for the singing... Fresh from the... Billy. Sorry. (FLATLY) ...world That's... That's lovely. That was lovely. I've got to run to work. Sorry. Sorry. Bye. I was really enjoying that. - Lisa, wait. - Why? That was like the incantations of a bunch of witches. - Bit dramatic. - No, it's an understatement. That was horrible. They need something to focus on. I think Afghan is enough. No, besides that. They need something to work on collectively, a project, something that brings them together. Look, if you think singing Onward, Christian Soldiers with a pole up your arse is what the women need, you're more out of touch than I thought. I am simply trying to do my duty as Colonel's wife... If you want to do it, just go ahead. You don't need my permission. We both know the women won't join if you don't. I'm quite aware of how they feel about me. Listen, I know you still want to be part of the gang. But unfortunately, you have a leadership role on this tour. And that means responsibilities. (WOMEN SINGING IN BACKGROUND) You may not need the choir, Lisa. But those women do. Blackbird has spoken Can we at least call it a singing club? How do people at Flitcroft get involved? They just turn up. No auditions, everyone welcome. Yeah, so it's like a drop-in. Yeah, and then you commit. But only if you really want to. It's not about experience or endless practice at home. KATE: Though it'd be encouraged. PRESENTER: So it's more about enthusiasm? - LISA: Well... - KATE: Yes. I know you're busy but would you like... Just two hours, once a week. Open to all ranks. Do you watch Songs Of Praise? You might enjoy that. We're forming a choir. Would you like to join? It's on Thursdays. PRESENTER: What kinds of songs will you sing? LISA: Pop music. KATE: Good old traditional and rousing. LISA: Rock. - So it's gonna be like Sister Act? - Yes. You know, without the Mafia hitmen. And the God bit. All right. I'll have a think. PRESENTER: It's open to all ranks, right? Oh, yes, this choir is inclusive. Yeah, this singing club is gonna be a lot of fun. And uplifting. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, and there'll be a few beers afterwards. La-la-la-la-la (HIGHER SCALE) La-la-la-la-la (SINGS HIGHER NOTES) That's lovely, a soprano. Little bit flat, but we can work on that. - Who's next? - I thought we didn't have to audition. This isn't an audition, I'm just determining your vocal range. Anyone? - Oh? - No. No? Why don't we just start off as a... like, as a group? Yeah, OK. Feel free. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Erm... All right, everyone stand up. Everyone on your feet. Yeah? When you can't sing the note just sit down. - It's OK, I'll do it. - (PLAYS NOTE) La-la-la-la-la (SINGING ASCENDING NOTES) La-la-la-la-la (PITCH CONTINUES ASCENDING) La-la-la-la-la (SINGS IN WRONG PITCH) (SINGS IN HIGH PITCH) Right, OK. Right, so everyone who's standing, you're a soprano. So you just go to your left. That's your right. My left. And if you're still sitting down, you're an alto. Go to the right. Ruby, I think you're more of a minor tone. She just means your voice is really powerful. - Yeah. - You know... Imagine you're Luke Skywalker and you have to learn to harness The Force. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) So where do the minors stand? - At the back. - In the front. Erm... middle? Yeah. BOTH: So... - You go ahead. No, no, go ahead. - No... - OK... - Thanks very much, Lisa. Lovely. So today's practice is going to focus on something called count singing. Don't panic. It's a very easy exercise to help us with pitch and rhythm without having to learn lyrics. Why don't we just sing a song? This is just how I learnt it at school. So... One, one, two, one One, two, three, two, one One, two, three, four, three, two, one See? It's very easy. All together now. One, one, two, one One, two, three, four, three, two, one One, two, three, four, five... No, sorry, there's no five. No five. We'll start again. One, one, two, three, two, one One, two, one One, two, three, four, three, two, one One, one, two, one... - Bang! - Oww! One, two, three, two... (HUMS TO TUNE OF DON'T YOU WANT ME) Bum-bum, ba-ba-bum Ba-ba-ba... - Does it not remind you of... - No. You were working as a waitress in a... Cocktail bar Does that... Shall we? ...when I met you I picked you up, I shook you off I turned you around I turned you into someone new Come on, the chorus. Don't... Don't... Don't you want me? You know I don't believe it When I hear that you won't see me Don't Don't you want me? You know I don't believe it when I hear that you won't see me It's much too late to find That you think you've changed your mind You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry Don't you want me, baby? Boom-ba-doop, boo Don't you want me, oh-oh? Don't you want me, baby? Ba-da-ba-ba Don't you want me, oh-oh? Don't you want me, baby? Don't you want me, oh-oh? (LOW CHATTER) Erm... I was just thinking we could have a chat about how we're gonna approach this. I wasn't aware we were approaching anything. - I thought you asked for my help. - To mobilise them. - I was thinking... - Look. The point of choir isn't to facilitate what the wives can already do. It's not sober karaoke. Choir needs to be challenging so that for one hour, they're thinking about something other than their troubles. We can't just muddle through. It needs to be organised, something we both know is not your strongpoint. Can I have my pocket money? What? You've had it. You know, you could do something to earn a bit of extra money. I'm not stacking shelves in the NAAFI again. No, I mean, like, child-minding for the singing club. - You could do that. - I'm all right. Where are you going? I'm about to make dinner. Nowhere. There is nowhere to go. - Well, what are you gonna eat? - I might go to the chippy later. Oh, the chippy? Good job you've got your leathers on. You know, and your full face. For the chippy. - I want change. - Bye! (DOOR SLAMS) (MUTTERS) One, two, three... Oh, my God. (COMPUTER GENERATED ACCOMPANIMENT) (CHILDREN LAUGHING) (LOW CHATTER) Hey, Kate, you're a soprano. Yeah, of course you are. Why don't you take a seat over there beside Annie? We're not singing Yazoo? And don't get used to these. I don't want you hiding behind them. - This is only the soprano part. - Yeah. - I divide them up into parts. - How do we know when to come in? I taught them. They listened and they memorised. Oh. Are you going to play that thing without any music? Yeah, I just think reading music makes things a bit stilted. Oh, not sure Mozart would agree with that. Well, The Beatles didn't read music and I think they did OK. Yeah, OK. So we're gonna do exactly what we did earlier. I'm gonna give you your starting note. (PLAYS NOTES) Three, four... (WOMEN HARMONISING) Looking from a window above It's like a story of love Can you hear me? Came back only yesterday I'm moving further away Want you near me LISA: Yeah, OK. It was really good, so... May I suggest we just take a little time just to learn the parts properly so that when we add them all together... Everyone's lost the will to live. Let's just sing it again. Just have one go, right? - OK, fine. - Let's just go again. Absolutely. (BOTH TALK AT ONCE) Sorry, but, my right hand will show the tempo. One, two, three, four... And my left hand is going to tell you when to come in. Like this. It's like she's guiding a plane in to land. - LISA: Finished? - Yeah. - And... - Let's have a... One, two, three, four... (WOMEN HARMONISING) Looking from a window above It's like a story of love Can you hear me? Came back only yesterday I'm moving further away Want you near me All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only you (WOMEN HARMONISING) We can't see you... There he is! - Can you see me? - Say, "Hi, Daddy." - Hey, Billy. - Hello, Daddy. - Hey, mate. - Hello, Daddy. - How are you? - Good. What have you been doing, Billy? Been a good boy for Mummy? Daddy misses you and Mummy a million... I miss you too. Are you there? Hello? We've lost you. Hang on, are you there? Hello? Ah-ha. LARRY: The Ultimatt Air Bed has a built-in pump and it can self-inflate in just three minutes. Yeah, it's just so efficient. This bed can support up to 200 kilograms. Suzy, you know what weighs 200 kilograms? SUZY: I don't know. You tell me, Larry. LARRY: This guy. (LAUGHS) Oh, my goodness! Is that a gorilla? Get in here, fella. It's not a real gorilla, it's actually a man in a gorilla suit and he has a weight belt underneath. Quite some weight. OK, go. Oh, wow! (FAINT CLATTERING) FRANKIE: Ow! FRANKIE: I can't... Frankie? - Are you all right? - My stuff's all wet. I've got you. Shout, shout, let it all out Let it all out Let it all out (PHONE BUZZING) These are the things I can do without Come on KATE: Your mum's not answering. I've left a message, I'm sure she'll be here in a minute. I'm not drunk, no. I only had one. (SOBS) Stop it spinning. (FRANKIE MOANS SOFTLY) Come on, let's get you on your side. (FRANKIE MUMBLES DRUNKENLY) There's a basin right here, OK? LISA: Sorry, I didn't see my phone. Right. (SIGHS) I mean, we could leave her and let her sleep it off. Yeah, maybe. Are you sure? Yeah. I guess they just need to let off a bit of steam sometimes. Yeah. Apparently, if they see their parents drinking, they're twice as likely to do it themselves. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. I'll let myself out. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. (DOOR SLAMS) (BIRD CAWING) MAN: (ON RADIO) ...control of insurgent strongholds in the area. Hello. Hiya. Is toast all right? I'm afraid I don't have any exciting breakfast cereals any more. (FRANKIE CHUCKLES) I dried your things out. FRANKIE: Thanks. Did I puke? KATE: Nope. Your house is dead tidy. Ours always looks like a bomb's gone off when Dad's away. Then I guess you haven't got anyone to make it messy, though. I suppose keeping it tidy gives me something to do. So you don't think about him? They think we don't know when people die, but we do. Like, everyone at school talks about it. - They talk about Jamie? - They talked about you more. Is that Jamie's car outside? No, it's mine. (SCOFFS) (BOTH CHUCKLE) KATE: Ah, hi, Frankie. Right, are we ready to go into the den and play a game? Shall we go? OK, right. Take your book and I'll see you in a minute. Oi, what are you doing? You about to take a biscuit? Go on. Go inside, we're gonna play a game together. - You minding kids? - Do you want to go inside? I asked her. I hope that's OK. They are a bit of a distraction. She's going to do it tomorrow as well while we go for a hike on the moors. Right. Is that Kate's punishment for you getting pissed last night? We need to talk about that, by the way. Whatever. No, I'm serious. Where were you? I was just out. Frankie! What? You all get pissed all the time cos there's nothing to do, why shouldn't I? I said no sheet music. Right, everyone up. Here's your starting note. I'm gonna count us in. Three, four... Shout, shout Let it all out These are the things I can do without Come on Louder. I'm talking to you, come on LISA: Come on, let rip! In violent times You shouldn't have to sell your soul That's good. In black and white They really, really ought to know OK, really belt it out this time. And can we hear the Ts, please? Enunciate. T-t-t. You shouldn't have to... Shout, shout, let it all out These are the things I can do without Come on KATE: Lisa? I'm talking to you, come on Look, I understand you want them to be passionate but really, it just doesn't sound very good. They're having fun. Better that than sounding joyless and in tune. I don't think projection is our issue. All the top conductors... This reminds me of when my parents got divorced. (BUZZ OF CHATTER) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (RAIN POURING) (SCREAMING AND SHRIEKING) (THUNDER CRASHES) (SOUND ECHOES) (HOWLS LIKE A DOG) (LAUGHTER) Have you got first-aid kit, Crooks? What's the problem? I'm the designated first-aider. Honestly, it's fine. I just need some plasters. I'll be the judge of that. There's nothing I didn't see in Iraq. It's for Dawn's nipples. She forgot to wear a bra and they're chafing. Erm... you'll find some plasters in there. Yeah, I'll bring... Yeah. (HOWLING LIKE WOLF) (ECHOING) Aa-ooh! (WOMEN HARMONISING) Ooh, ooh Sounds really nice. That sounds gorgeous! (WOMEN CONTINUE HARMONISING VOCALS) Keep going, keep going. Looking from the window above Like a story of love - Go on! - Go on. Can you hear me? Came back only yesterday I'm moving further away Want you near me All I needed was the love you gave All I needed for another day And all I ever knew Only you Ba-da-da, bum-bum Ba-da-da, bum-bum Sometimes when I think of her name When it's only a game And I need you Listen to the words that you say... - Go on, Jess. - [CLAPPING] MAN: Bravo! Fifty quid a ticket, mate. Where are you going? Where were you hiding that? Of course the Welsh girl can bloody sing. It's all that yodelling in the valleys. Thank you, kind ramblers! All of the people, around us they say I don't know. Maybe this choir isn't about singing for ourselves You know, maybe it's about them being heard. Are you suggesting a performance? Yeah, but, you know, nothing fancy. Just maybe going to town. People round here don't know we exist. But the Military don't want us to be tall poppies. - I don't know what that means. - It means... It's about appropriateness. I'm sure between us we can figure out something appropriate. That's amazing. In the market with everyone watching? It ticks a box, apparently. The new community covenant to break down barriers and engage with the locals. Can we do Lulu? What about something modern, like Rihanna? - Africa by Toto. - No, we need Holding Out For A Hero. - That's a classic. - No, it has to be something serious. Bonnie Tyler's got really serious hair. - Emotional serious. - Time After Time, Cyndi Lauper. I don't think I could do a sad song. Just sing the tune. Don't think about the meaning of the words. Can I do a solo? I promise I won't lose my nerve. Mm-hm. Erm... or, we were actually thinking about... missus there. No way. - LISA: What? Why? - No, I can't. - You can. - (WOMEN VOICE ENCOURAGEMENTS) - You can. - You can. KATE: One, two, three, four... (OFF-TUNE AND DISJOINTEDLY) Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick And I think of you Caught up in circles JESS: (MELODICALLY) Confusion is nothing new Secrets stolen From deep inside The second hand unwinds (SOPRANO) If you're lost you can look and you will find me (ALTO) Time after time (MEZZO SOPRANO) If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time Sometimes you picture me I'm walking too far ahead You're calling to me I can't hear what you've said Secrets stolen From deep inside The drum beats out of time If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting I will be waiting I will be waiting I will be waiting Time after time If you fall, I will catch you I'll be waiting I will be waiting... All seems first-rate. Same time next month, then. Let me just show you what the women have been up to since your last visit. ...too far ahead You're calling to me I can't hear what you have said HQ are going to love this. Fits in perfectly with the new directives. You should have heard them on the hike, sir. We were in... Thank you, Captain. My car's waiting. The drum beats out of time If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you... I'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost you can look and you will find me (HIGH-PITCHED) Time after time Time after time If you fall, I will catch you... I will be waiting Time after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall, I will catch you... I will be waiting (DOOR OPENS) Time after time Time after time I need to speak to you all. Oh, Jesus. Is it about the blow-up doll we sent out to Bastion? (TITTERS OF LAUGHTER) She's joking. Brigadier Groves heard you rehearsing when he was here a few weeks ago. He's told the top brass. And you've been invited to sing at the Festival of Remembrance. What? The Festival of Remembrance on TV? - The big one? - CROOKS: That one. At the Royal Albert Hall? (MURMURS OF SHOCK AND EXCITEMENT) I can't wait to tell my mum. Do you reckon the lads will be able to see it out in Afghan? - Hope not. - You don't need to worry. We are gonna be match fit after that market gig. It's all right for you, Maz. You haven't got to do a solo. Just see the market as a dress rehearsal. And I'll be by your side. Like shoulder buddies. Eh? Come on, cheer up. You're not helping, Maz. Is that not helping you? MAN: Stop the war, sign the petition. Stop the war, sign the petition. Troops out of Afghanistan. Stop the war, sign the petition. Stop the bloodshed. Troops out of Afghanistan. Can I interest you in a leaflet? We don't have the privilege of being against the war. We're married to it. Stop it. Good afternoon, everyone. We are the Flitcroft Military Wives Choir. We'd like to sing for you this afternoon. - Three, four... - (TRUCK BLEEPS WHILST REVERSING) Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick And I think of you CHOIR: Caught up in circles Confusion is nothing new (BOYS SHOUTING OUTSIDE) You say, "Go slow" (SLIGHTLY OFF-KEY) I fall behind (OFF-TUNE) The second hand... The second hand unwinds If you're lost you can look and you will find me Time after time If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting I will be waiting Time after time Time after time Time after time Come on. Time after time (EXHALES HEAVILY) (MAN COUGHS) (BABY CRIES) Time after time Time after time We'll be laughed out of the Albert Hall. I don't want to sing any more. I'm not a minor, I'm just shit! Maybe you could silently mouth the words. Like Dawn. Erm... Marilyn? What does your football coach say to you after a defeat? Easy. It's all about control. Exactly. A defence-splitting pass, bring it down, knock it to the forwards. Boom. - Look, do you like singing? - Of course we do. - Do you like being in the choir? - Love it. Think the top brass would've asked you to sing if you were shit? No, we just chose the wrong venue. - Yeah, and that was our fault. - Exactly. Do you want to give up because of that or work harder so we really kill it at the Albert Hall? - Kill it. - LISA: Which? - Kill it. - LISA: Right. So how shall we do that, Kate? Er... well, we choose a small repertoire. We practise together and at home. We tweak, we review, tweak, review until we come together like a shoal of fish. (SHOUTS OF AGREEMENT) The best Military Wives choir in England. Well, the only Military Wives choir in England. (LAUGHS) MAZ: Come on, girls. We're singing for England Eng-ger-land We're singing in a foreign... Oi! If I'd done that... For England You've got to hold and give and do it at the right time You can be slow or fast but you must get to the line Behold our choir. Dignified, noble. Class. So catch me if you can cos I'm an England woman What would your karaoke song be? Karaoke's my idea of hell. But if you had to, if you'd no choice? KATE: Well, I did do Tainted Love once. But then I drank two bottles of white wine, smoked a packet of cigarettes and threw up in Richard's parents' garden. Sounds like a good night. So Tainted Love? - No! - I'll do it with you. Come on. Imagine their little faces. Why not? No one's going to remember in the morning. We're doing it. MC: Kiki and Elton. Come on, everyone, this is a classic. That's a lucky escape. Next one. Don't go breaking my heart I couldn't if I tried (FADING OUT) Well, honey, if I get restless... (SOUND FADES UP) You took the weight off of me Oh, honey, knock... Knock on my door Ooh, I gave you my key Ohhh... Ooh-hoo Nobody knows it Hey. I wasn't trying to be pushy. No, no, no. I just needed some air, that's all. Yeah, well, Kevin's singing will do that to you. Jamie and I sang that song together at his 18th. - Oh, fuck. - Yeah. He made me. I was mortified. He, of course, thought it was hilarious. But then, he thought his job on this earth was to keep people laughing. Yeah, I remember Red saying that he had a way of looking at things... he'd just find the funny in everything. Even when he was little. Whenever Richard went away, we'd have this big jar of sweets, and Jamie was allowed one sweet a day every day of the tour. And when the jar was empty, Richard... Frankie did that. Counting down the days till the family was back together again. Jamie used to say, "Until we laugh again." - (CHUCKLES) - Mm. - That's so sweet. - Yeah. I don't know how you... - (CHEERING FROM INSIDE) - Oh. Right, OK. I'm off. You don't have to. I'm not gonna make you sing. Good night. Hey, Kate? The Albert Hall, huh? Not tall poppies any more, we're bloody sunflowers. (LAUGHS) Night. If you wanna be my lover Slam, slam, slam, slam! If you wanna be my lover... Slam your body down and wind it all around Hup, hup, hup, hup! (PHONE BUZZES) - Tell me. - CROOKS: Comms are down. Richard's been injured but he's gonna be OK. He's in Kabul hospital. RAMC will fly him back later today, transfer him straight to Flitcroft. Any fatalities? Handball. You handballed that. Skills. Go on. Gotcha. Ready? Pass me the ball. Come on, pass me the ball. Let's go and get a little biccy or something, eh? All right? - Any pink ones? - Yeah. (DOOR BELL RINGS) - Sarah Cartwright? - (GASPS) Who is her trusted friend? She didn't name anyone. Said she was waiting to see who she got close to. (CLEARS THROAT) Well, Jess is good at stuff like that. Or Ruby. She's asked for you, Kate. Says you've been there yourself. OK. It's fallen over. Sorry? Liam's teddy's fallen over. That doesn't mean anything. Of course it does, because what it means has happened. (SNIFFS) Here. Thanks. Do I have to leave the base now? No. No, whenever you're ready. But don't think about that now. Right, so... shall we give it a go? Do you think she's read Liam's death letter yet? I don't think I could read Stu's if it came to it. I read Malc's... after the last Afghan tour. I'd do it again. It helped me. It said... all these lovely things about me that he'd never say to my face. To be fair, though, he's not gonna not write that, is he? I mean, he's not gonna write a list of things he hates about you. (LAUGHTER) "Dear Ruby, wish you'd rinse the bath out after you shave your legs." (LAUGHTER) "Dear Jess, "really wish you wouldn't wash up the cups before I'd finished my tea." I wish you wouldn't do that, to be honest. It's so annoying. I just can't bear the thought of anyone coming to give me bad news and the house being a mess. MAZ: (SIGHS) I'm not in the mood for singing today. (MOANS SOFTLY) KATE: Darling. This is nothing serious. - You're lucky. - I was stupid. Mm. Katy, there's something I need to tell you. No, you don't. - I don't? - No. I know you didn't have to go. You put yourself forward. You try and file away those feelings about what happened on the shelves in your head. I shouldn't have gone. (PHONE BUZZES) Richard, sorry, I've got so many things to do, I've got to leave. Call you later. It's the thing I admire about you most, the way you cope. That is a depressing thing to say, Richard. Are you going to put that on my gravestone? I meant I understand how you feel. Oh, you understand? What do you understand, exactly? - Enlighten me. - No, I just... I'm the one who has to answer the phone in the night, who has to worry about what state you'll come back in, who has to... who has to look at you in that bed and then I have to go out there, I have to get on with it and do my duty. I have responsibilities, I can't go round with a wet face. "I'm so sorry, my husband's been blown up. Would you like a cup of tea? "I'm so sorry, my husband's got shrapnel in his head. "Have some cake." I've always said you should be paid for what you do. (PHONE BUZZES) (SIGHS) Lisa, I can't come to practice now. I'm at the hospital with Richard. How is he? - He's fine. - OK. Good. - What's the matter? - No, I just wanted to, erm... let you know that you don't need to worry about the Albert Hall. The women don't want to do it any more. - It's a bit late for that. - I'm sorry? It's utterly inappropriate to pull out now. Well, they feel it would be utterly inappropriate for them to sing. Lisa, if we pull out now, it will reflect badly on all of us. (SIGHS) Shit. (EXHALES HEAVILY) There will be a service at Camp Bastion. Then Liam's body will be repatriated on a C-17 aircraft coming through Wootton Bassett. After that, you and his parents are going to have to make some decisions. Well, he grew up in care. It's just me and the Army. And he... Did he ever express any wishes? No? OK. Well, then, we have to decide what you want, whether you want a cremation or a burial... flowers and a reading... What did you do? Oh, erm... James had a willow coffin. Are they the ones where there's no lid and the bodies are covered with flowers? You can do, but Jamie needed a lid. Liam's gonna need a lid as well, isn't he? - (DOOR BELL RINGS) - Shall I get that? It's OK. Right. (CLEARS THROAT) Guys. Oh, come in, come in. Come in. (BUZZ OF CHATTER) Guys? OK. Sorry, could I... Could I just play you something and ask you a question? So I first met Liam when he was put next to me in English. He was dead naughty and I was always a bit of a swat. They thought I'd sort him out. But our teacher took us on a trip to York Cathedral. And there was a choir practising this. Liam hated classical music. He preferred grime. (LAUGHS) But he did always like this. This one. And he sat next to me to listen to it. And while it was playing, he touched my hand. And I remember nothing about the rest of the concert, I was too busy thinking about his hand. So that is how I'd really like to feel when I say bye to him. You know, I want to feel his hand touching mine. So I'd really, really love it if... if you could sing this for me, well, for him, at his service. (SINGS AVE MARIA) Maiden mild O, listen to a maiden's prayer For Thou canst hear amid the wild 'Tis Thou 'Tis Thou canst save amid despair - SOLDIER: Fire! - (GUNSHOT) Load! - Fire! - (GUNSHOT) - It was a beautiful service. - Thank you. Kate. It's been far too long. I'm really looking forward to the full choir performance at the Festival of Remembrance. Yes, but sadly we're not going to do it. What? Yes, the women have decided that it's just too soon. You're not doing the Albert Hall? Well... You sang today and it was beautiful. But that was just for you today, it was personal, not for entertainment. SARAH: Guys, make it personal, then. Please don't pull out. There are gonna be so many people in that room... like me. And I want to do this for them. But I can't do that on my own. - What are we gonna sing? - Does it have to be classical? Dunno. Maybe we should do Angels, like at Sarah's wedding. It's not really about us, though, is it? We're not gonna find anything that's about us, though. Know what song I've always really liked? That Dido one where she goes, "I woke up, my tea's cold, I've got a hangover "but you've made everything great." That classic! It is a classic, it's really personal. My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds on my window And I can't see at all And then Eminem, don't say it, starts rapping about a psychotic stalker. Love that at the Royal Albert Hall. Maz could do that bit. Bit of rapping. - I forgot about that bit. - Maz and a rap. Let's, er... Let's just keep thinking, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right. - Night. Have a good night. (YOUNG JAMIE LAUGHING) Yeah! (DOOR OPENS) Oh, you have a bluey from Dad. Right. Do you want to watch a film? A film. Oh. Yeah. - Yeah. - What do you fancy? I will have a look. Rocky? (CHUCKLES) What? Are you serious? Yeah. - OK, fine. - Yes, yes! MAZ: That's a good idea, Lisa. But the thing is, all my letters are about QPR. - Mine are far too mucky. - (TITTERING) We won't put any of the dirty bits in. We'll just... you know, find bits that represent our feelings and just work it into the song. Just like that? I'm not expecting to win a Brit Award. But how bad can it be? - You've not read what I've written. - (LAUGHTER) It's not gonna be all, "I love you to the moon and back" is it? I don't want to puke down myself in the Albert Hall. You don't want me to make us look like meek little women pining for our big brave husbands? And wives. What's wrong with saying, "I love you to the moon and back"? LISA: There's nothing wrong with it at all, Jess. It's just a little bit... - Sorry. - ANNIE: Kate? Lisa's got an idea for the Albert Hall. Oh, good. I was just thinking about what Sarah was saying... about making the song more personal. We're gonna write our own song. - Using bits of our letters. - Yeah. MAZ: And putting them to Lisa's tune. Oh. - Play your song for her. - Go on, play it. It's not a song yet. It's just... It's a... You know, it's like a... It's a tune. You have to imagine the words bit. (HUMS TUNE) Actually, do you think we could talk about this later? Well, why don't we talk about it now? Everyone's here. Really, how realistic is this, given your limitations? - What? - You can't read music, can you? The Festival of Remembrance is a professional event. It's not some amateur school choir performance. We cannot embarrass ourselves and we cannot let Flitcroft down. Do you know what? Forget it. Let's go back to the song board. (WOMEN PROTEST) Come on. I think we should write our own song. Lisa, go on. And even if it's not amazing, at least it's ours. MAZ: Exactly. - Agreed. - Yeah. WOMAN: (ON TV) Next up, we have the innovative LED colour-changing shower head... - You coming to bed? - (TV OFF) I'll be up in a minute. OK. - WOMAN: (ON TV) Can you believe that? - MAN: (ON TV) That's crazy. And it's only £119.99 plus postage and packaging. "I swear that... I keep no secrets from you." - LISA: OK. - Embarrassing, that. Jess, what have you got? The only bit that could really work in this song, is about the moon. - I love the moon! - Go on. But it is actually what Stu writes to me, so I suppose that's OK. Erm... "At 10 o'clock tonight, I'll look at the moon. That's 1:30 for you." And then we look at it... ...at the same time. That's lovely. "10 o'clock." - Erm... - Next. We don't really go for all that gushy stuff but... Well, we always recognise the unsaid. We don't say what we're both feeling. LISA: What goes unsaid. (PLAYS NOTES) (LOW CHATTER) (LAUGHTER) (HUMS SOFTLY) (PLAYS NOTES) Frankie, can you just not... What's the matter with you? The matter with me is, I still haven't finished the song yet. I can't... I've run out of bits from the women's letters. - Just make something up. - I can't make something up. I'm padding it out enough as it is. Frankie, wait. Sorry. Look through these notes, see if you can find... I can't. I'm going out and I'm late. Late for what? Getting pissed with rear party soldiers? I'm actually going out to child-mind for your choir so that they can try on outfits for tomorrow. (DOOR CLOSES) So, Tina. Aretha. Madonna, Cher. Where's Dawn? Dawn? Sorry, Dawn. LISA: So come here. There's a line I thought could be really good for a contralto. Am I a contralto? Yes. I think so. Thank you. Thank you. There's been some tweaks to the lyrics. Don't panic, cos we'll rehearse it on the bus. Whose is that, then, "Till We Laugh Again"? Is that the new one? - Where's that? - At the bottom. "Till We Laugh Again." I wanted to clear it with you, but I just ran out of time. There was a gap. I mean, everyone else has something in but... I thought it might help you, you know, sing about him. I told you that in confidence. Not so that you could use my child's words... to fill a gap in your crass, sentimental ballad. Mum, have you seen my bag? - Just get on the bus, Frankie. - No, I... - Just get on the bus! - KATE: I should have known. I should have known you would lose sight of what is important because you're so obsessed with your five minutes of fame! What are you talking about? While you're swanning around, thinking you're Paul fucking Mull of Kintyre, your annihilated daughter is prowling the streets like a cat on heat. Before you know it, she's gonna be handing out BJs or knocked up by some spotty squaddie who doesn't know his arse from his elbow! You don't hand out blow-jobs. You do them with your mouth. Not that I'd expect you to know that. You probably tell Richard "to keep calm and carry on" when he's shagging you. I never claimed to be a good songwriter, or even a good mum, but I am trying! And all you do is criticise and belittle me. But maybe I should have known that, because you are a cold-hearted... uptight bitch, Kate! No wonder your husband volunteered to go back to the war. Do you know what? The bloody choir was your idea. Remember? You gave me that bullshit speech about the women needing it. That it would bring them together. Really, you are the one that needed the choir, because you needed something to do. No, we all need something to do. No, we don't, Kate, cos we all still have our kids! (CHATTERING) - Guys, Kate's gone. - What? - That's it. I don't know any more. - Where's she gone? - I don't know. - Kate's gone? - Can I borrow your... - MAN: Yeah, sure. - Erm... - (FEEDBACK WHINE) - Er... - (FEEDBACK WHINE) Sorry about the, erm... Sorry. Can we drive? Can we go now? (ENGINE STARTS) (SOBS) (SOBBING INTENSIFIES) (EXHALES HEAVILY) (SOBS) Can I get in? (DOOR CREAKS) (EXHALES HEAVILY) What happened to the choir? They've gone. Lisa used something Jamie said... in her song, without asking me. "Until we laugh again." It's ridiculous. I know it's just words, it doesn't matter. It's not ridiculous at all. Oh, God, I said some awful things. I behaved so badly. I've let you down. No. We're both guilty of that. (CHUCKLES) I threw my shoes on the ground like a two-year-old. Well, it's no surprise you've come to hide in Shite Rider, then, is it? The car wasn't called Shite Rider, it was Jamie who was Shite Rider. - The car was called Dave. - Dave. (SIGHS) (KATE SOBS SOFTLY) - Is it a panic attack? - This is gonna be a disaster. - It's not. - I appreciate your optimism, - but our last proper performance... - Our only proper performance... ...was a complete shit storm. And there wasn't any last-minute lyric changes. - Lisa wasn't spinning out. - And we had Kate. (OPENS GLOVE COMPARTMENT) Let's take him for a spin. Blow the cobwebs out. It'll never work. Try. - Come on, Dave. - (IGNITION TURNING OVER) - No. - Try again. (SIGHS) - (ENGINE FAILS TO START) - No. Nothing there. (LAUGHS) Hey. (MUSIC POUNDING THROUGH HEADPHONES) Nice to get out. I'm sorry. I know how I've been acting with you. I know I've been hard on you. I made so many mistakes when I was young, Frankie. I just don't want the same for you. I love you. And when I was looking through those letters to your dad, you know, for the song... they were all about you. (TURNS MUSIC BACK ON) - RICHARD: Take the strain. - KATE: Yeah. - OK, push! - I am. - Come on, put your back into it. - I am pushing. Stop complaining. - I'm injured. - Stop being such a martyr. RICHARD: It hurts! Come on, top of the hill and gravity will do the rest. That's it. All right. Go on, then. Jump in. KATE: I'm getting in. RICHARD: Right, we can let the hill do the work now. - Ready? - Yeah. RICHARD: OK. - (KATE LAUGHS) - Come on. Come on, jibble it. - (ENGINE SPLUTTERING) - Come on, come on! Come on, Dave! - (ENGINE STARTS) - Whoa-ho! Oh. Well? (ENGINE REVS) JESS: Oh, my God. - How tall is that? - I'm really nervous now. - ...it's like security. - We're never gonna get in. Yeah, you're not allowed! Oh, my God! Let's just all gather together here. Flitcroft Choir? You're on stage in 30 for a sound check. We know where we're going. Everyone stick together. CROOKS: Ladies and gentlemen, the Flitcroft Choir! ALL: Yeah! Katy, I need to ask you something. The airing cupboard has some new additions. Well, I needed something to lean on. Would you prefer that I drank or gambled? No, of course not. Fair enough. A juicer... a meat slicer's a bit more tenuous. But... But... 250 quid on an inflatable bed for a gorilla? Well, it's not for a gorilla, it's just to illustrate its weight capacity. Oh... (CHUCKLES) Oh, piss off, Richard! ANNOUNCER: Flitcroft Choir, please take your positions on the risers for sound check. LISA: On the podium thing. - Just find our spots. - MAN: Camera three. (WOMEN GASP) - What are you doing? - Checking my heart rate. You look like you're choking yourself. OK, so we've got three hours. OK, we've got three... Where's Jess? Oh, she's here. What's the matter with her? Did she faint? She's meditating. She can't lay down properly cos she's come out in a rash on her arse. Right. (BUZZ OF CHATTER) Can you just, like, get into your groups? It sounded like you were... Right, then, ladies. How are we all... I'm shitting my pants! OK? Very good. Carry on. There's been a bit of discussion about that lyric change. We're confused. We're not doing Kate's lyric. We're just gonna do a repeat of the second part of the first verse. - Erm... so let's... - (WOMEN CHATTER) Let's... Let's start by running up some... Stop talking. Let's start by running up some scales. One, one, two, one... One, two, three, two, one... - One, two, three, four... - ...three, four, five... Not five! Start again. Let's just all sing at the same time, OK? Do it together. It's fun. And smiles. Enjoy it. Maybe you should go and get some air. Just take five minutes. - It'll be fine. - Yeah. OK. Yeah. All right, you... (MAN WOLF-WHISTLES) All right? - Piss off! - (LAUGHTER) Can you zip me up? ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, take your seats. Thank you. ...members in the Grand Tier please use entrances M to S. Those with tickets to the Second Tier, please use A to F. Thanks. RICHARD: Good luck. You'll be marvellous! Kate! I am so sorry. Oh, Jesus. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. - I changed the lyric. - No. No, you didn't have to do that. Lisa, your song is beautiful. And I will be proud to stand next to you and sing it. Really? OK. - Right, are they ready? - Yeah. Er... no. No, they didn't want to go on without you. Oh. It's after what I said to you earlier. I think they're fucking scared of me. - You've got one hour. - You look gorgeous. Not the boots, but... (LOW CHATTER) I know it's gonna be louder. Kate! - Oh, my God! - Flipping heck! - (DELIGHTED LAUGHTER) - You made it. That's enough, that's enough. Quiet everyone, please. Listen to Lisa, she has something very important to say. - What? - Yeah, come on. Oh, shit. Er... Erm... OK. I dunno. Great music, it doesn't happen when... things are perfect. It happens when you care. I know you all really care. Have you seen Rocky? Well, you know, did he win his first fight? He doesn't. He gets the shit beaten out of him. In public. But does he give up and sit around crying? He does in Rocky III. (LAUGHTER) Look, I know it feels a bit much right now, going out there and doing that. But, Jesus. If we can survive the last five months... we can survive five minutes out there. - Yeah. - Yeah? Every successful choir... is just a bad choir that didn't give up. - (LAUGHTER) - OK, choir. You've got ten minutes to get ready. And then we are gonna run our song. Right, and then we are gonna run it and we are gonna run it, and we are gonna run it until we all come together. - Like a shoal of fish. - Right, exactly. Like that. OK, come on, get ready. (WOMEN CLAMOURING) Ooh. Ooh, Frankie. What size feet have you got? Why? Yeah. PRESENTER: Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to this year's Festival of Remembrance from London's Royal Albert Hall, where the British Legion celebrates the courage of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families, and remembers sacrifices made from the Somme to Helmand Province. (FANFARE PLAYS) (APPLAUSE) (CHEERING) - Come and see. - No, thank you. It's like childbirth. Best to be completely oblivious until it's happening. COMPERE: Now some performers you won't have heard of. They're an often-forgotten but essential part of the fabric of the Armed Forces on whom our troops rely. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the Flitcroft Military Wives Choir. (APPLAUSE) (PIANO INTRO) Time drags its feet Feels like forever But the longer the wait The sweeter the kiss All I really know Is we're stronger together If that isn't love Then I don't know what is CHOIR: I know you can't say How you're really feeling But what goes unsaid Is what I'm feeling too So here we are living Life through a letter There's nothing I love more Than home thoughts from abroad At 10 o'clock tonight I'll be looking at the moon That's 1:30 for you Will you be up then too? I know that if it's shining on me then it shines for you These simple things Help me get through I stand in the storm Just me and my sails And hope that it blows me Closer to you Secrets keep you sick - Secrets keep you sane - They stop me from sleeping I want you to know I keep no secrets from you You always knew How to keep the world laughing Till we laugh again These home thoughts from abroad At 10 o'clock tonight I'll be looking at the moon That's 1:30 for you Will you be up then too? I know that if it's shining on me Then it shines for you These simple things Help me get through (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) MAN: Bravo! My hands are still shaking. Urh... oh... oh... oh - Yeah! - Can we get two bottles of champagne? I don't remember what I did. Excuse me. Do you think I could get your autograph? (ANNIE SNIGGERS) I haven't got an autograph. Just do a symbol, you know, like Prince. Thank you. Can I get your autograph, please? Get lost. I don't need your autograph. I've got your number. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. I'm not great, obviously. But, yeah, I'm all right. I'm just really gonna miss the choir when I move home. What do you mean? Your parents only live three miles up the road from the base. Can I stay in the choir? Oh, I'll have to think about that. Of course you can stay, silly! Well done. - Well done? - Yeah. That was really good. Oh, my God! Hang on, just give me a second. Something I did was really good? All right, don't be weird about it. OK, I won't tell anyone you said it. Just myself, sometimes. I think we both deserve this. Yeah. To the choir. To the choir. Group photo, everyone. All right, everybody in. Everybody. Right, ready? OK, everyone say, "Cheese!" - We did it, ladies. - Yeah! You should feel very proud. I'm very proud of you. - LISA: Hey, Crooks! - Bye-bye. How about enhancing the spousal experience by riding with Richard so Kate can come with us? (WOMEN SHOUT ENCOURAGEMENT) She's all yours. Yeah! She's on the coach (LAUGHING) She's on the coach - Take care of that, Captain. - Of course, sir. Welcome to Dave. Is Sarah here? Did she turn up? Oh, she's there. (MUSIC PLAYING) (WE ARE FAMILY PLAYING) We're gonna do the same places as at the Albert Hall. Will you come down? We'll start with something fun and easy. Round the back. There we go.
