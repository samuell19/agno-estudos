Frankie. Frankie, here! Dave. Frankie. Just like Christmas. I got you a room at the avon. It's not good. It's not bad. It's a room. You look great. I only wish I felt 18% as good. Bars, Dave... I guess I'll never get away from them. Come on, Frankie. Let's grab a cab to the hotel. Let's drive up Broadway first. Sure. 14 years, and it's still the same. It only looks the same, Frankie. It better be the same. Like I said, not good, not bad... a room. Who's that? Come in. Put it on the table. I told them to bring it up when you got here. Thank you. I figured maybe you hadn't eaten. Oh, I got you socks and shirts and underwear... top and bottom kind. Fine, Dave. Bought you a new suit. I went to Davinni's, like you said. They'll send a man over for the alterations... "bit unusual," they said, but they'll do it. He'll be here as soon as he can. I know how to wait. Sure picked a good tailor. Alex in the next cell told me about him. Alex used to be a tough tailor himself. Oh? Till he stabbed his partner. Oh. He went out and bought himself a knife to do it with. He didn't want to dirty his own shears. His partner crossed him, Dave. How's "dink" these days? All right. Busy. But, look, Frankie, I've got to get back. Got books to go over. I'll see you later? What's the trouble? Hmm? You're scared, kid. Me? No. I can smell it. I spent 14 years where everybody was scared. What is it? Nothing, Frankie, I tell y... is it dink? Has he got his teeth in you? Here. The regent club. Noll Turner and his famous majordomo, Maurice. Noll with a dame so rich. What's he trying to do... crash society right at the top?! "Coaching. " My pal dink. He sent me a carton of cigarettes once a month... never a visit, never even a letter! Listen, Frankie... I was 63 minutes away by the new parkway, and he never drove it once. I seen you go to pieces little by little each visit day. Is it dink? What's he doing to you?! Frankie... Oh, cut it out, Frankie. Let me alone. You're 2 years older than me, and I've been in jail, and you look 10 years older than me. In the drawer, in the gideon Bible, there's some money. Hello, Dave. Dan. Dave is on his way in. Thanks. You look worried. A profound remark. Afraid for your 5% of the regent? Come in. I met him at the rail road station, Noll, like you said. What was the first thing he did... drive up Broadway? Yeah. What's his attitude toward me? Sore. He... Yeah? He wanted to know if you had your teeth in me. What's he want? He didn't say. Think carefully. You find out what he wants, I'll know how he'll act... And I can counteract. He didn't let on. That'll be all, Dave. Oh, Dave? Yeah? When he asked if I had my teeth in you, what did you say? I said it was the books that were getting me down. That's all. I told you to go up there. I told you I didn't have time. No time? You had a couple of years' time to play with kay Lawrence and plenty of time to go riding with Mrs. Richardson every day. I know what you want... a ring of steel around your 5%. That's why I can always handle you. Thinking machine, huh? So cool and mechanical. The famous ice water in the Turner vein. Iced champagne. When I find out just what Frankie has on his mind, I'll be able to handle him, too. Sometimes you talk... Frankie's my boy. For the three years we were together, I could get him to do anything I wanted. I've heard of people who change in 14 years. Maurice, the regent club took building... what's that got... ...and it was built on one thing... my personality. That same personality charmed Frankie then. It'll do it now. I can handle him. I've heard of people who changed in 14 years. Don't keep saying that. Sure, I know people can change in 14 years. Come in. Package, Mr. Turner, to be delivered to you personally. Brunswick lager. Thanks, Dan. Brunswick lager? Never heard of it. Must be a new brand. That was before your time, Maurice... our old prohibition group. "Our"? Frankie's and mine. He sent it? Uh-huh. Why? What does it mean? I don't know. But a lot of men died because of that beer, Maurice. Hello, Frankie. Dan. Well, at least you're out in the open. That's better than hiding behind a steel door and looking through a peephole. I recognize the eye. Where's dink? Mossy and George... they work here, too, in the kitchen, and Ben at the bar. So? Things got awfully tough, Frankie. Noll took care of us. Nell's been awfully good to us. You're trying to tell me you picked the team you want to play with, huh? We're grateful to Noll. It's good to see you, Frankie. Yes, Maurice? Dan says he's outside now. Show him to my office. He'll come in hot. We'll let him cool. Is that smart? I'm sorry, Noll. So, you're the famous kay Lawrence... ...who takes so well to coaching. I must be famous if you've heard of me. Mr. Madison? Yeah? This way, please. Frankie. Hello, Ben. Dan said you were here. Put on a little weight, haven't you? Madison? Frankie Madison. He was before your time, kay. Fix me something, will you, Ben? What'll it be? Oh, anything that comes to your mind. All the songs sound alike these days, Ben. He's tied up. He'll be with you as soon as he can. So? Make yourself at home. I don't like people watching me. Yes, sir. Noll. Well, hello, kitten. Why, you look beautiful. You can do better than that. Business in there... your lipstick on my mouth would hardly do, kitten. Mmm. I had forgotten kittens can scratch. You've forgotten a lot. You may be right. Noll? Oh, uh, excuse me, kay. How'd he react to the picture? I forgot to wait and see. Relax, will you? Yes, certainly, but what are you going to do? Soften him, keep softening till I find out what he's after. Oh, I'll buzz when I want you to break this up. Yes. And relax, will you? Yes, Noll. Don't move, dink. I just want to get a good look at you. It's been a long time. Well? How do I look, Frankie? Not so good, dink. You look tops. You're pale. Really? Naturally. That's what you get for being cooped up in a nightclub all the time. Now, take me... I got the sun every day. I had to hurry to get a spot in the right corner of the yard, but I got the sun every day... healthy. And I'll bet you're smoking too much. You know, I got along on a carton a month. Frankie... and the hours you keep... no wonder you look pale. I never got to bed later than 10:00. You can't go on living this way, dink. I'll have to see to that. Good picture of us. I had the same picture up there. After a while, I threw it away. All right. Granted... I should have written you. Granted. And I should have come up to see you? That's right. It would have done more harm than good. Why? You come in the club now, Frankie, and you see activity, people. But when I first opened, Frankie, there were nights when I didn't have five people in the club and four of them on the cuff. Too bad. Look, Frankie, building the club's been long and hard. If I'd come up to see you, some shutter-happy photographer would have taken the picture. They took a picture of me... front, face, and profile. All it would take would be one picture. "Noll Turner of the famous regent club visits murderer friend. " The next night, we'd be back to five people in the club. And four of them on the cuff. I don't know, Frankie. I made Dave visit you every visiting day. I made him tell me how you were, how you looked... everything about you. What good would it have done? The club closed... who could you have come to for help? I didn't forget, and I've taken care of the boys... Dan at the door outside and mossy and Harry. Perhaps I did wrong, but if I were doing it again, I'd do it the same way. What about Dave? What about him? Brunswick lager. You and me and Dave. It was the three of us then. Why don't Dave have a piece of this place? I offered it to him time and again. He'd never take it. I don't believe you. I don't blame you. Yes, sir? Send Dave in. Mr. Turner wants to see you. Right. Ask him. Dink says he offered you a piece of the club. Did he? Yeah, lots of times. What'd you say? I turned it down. Why?! Oh, Frankie, the headaches and worries... that's not for me. I found out a long time ago I'm my own boss as long as somebody else is my boss. Dave, you're the one I trust... I guess the only one. Are you leveling with me, Dave? Yeah, Frankie. Thank you, Dave. Frankie, those years we had together... they were rough and tough, but they were the best years of my life, and I'm not gonna lose them again. While you were gone, I did a lot of thinking, too. I've had plans for a long time... plans for you. I'm sorry there's been a misunderstanding. I know just what I'm gonna do... I left word I wasn't to be disturbed by anyone. But the table captains... Oh, I know, I know. I'll be with you as soon as I can, kid. We've got a lot to talk about. Don't make it too long, dink. Why don't you have Dave show you around the club? You'll find him at the bar, huh? I'll do that. "Dink"? Put that beer away someplace. He's smart, Maurice, but he's sentimental... always was. He's feeling for Dave... touching. Get kay in here. Kay? She's a good listener. Nothing like a good listener to make a man talk. When a man talks, particularly a sentimental man, he's bound to soften. Get kay. All right, now. Mrs. Richardson is in the bar. Oh. Look, will you make some excuse for me? Uh, tell her I'll be with her as soon as I can and give her some of that old cognac she likes. I've already taken care of her for you. The bar's a little bit bigger than the old four kings, huh, Dave? Yeah, three times as big... five times the inventory, by volume. Dave... A tie shouldn't look so uneven. Kay, Noll wants you. Yes? Now. Now he can wait. Your hands are shaking. There. Thanks. Your hands are still shaking. You're right. If you want to see him so bad, why don't you go to him? Psychology. I was staring, wasn't I? Yes, you were. Dave, I'm waiting on Mr. Chapman, a. J. Routine, Frankie. Want to see how I check? Numbers drown me, kid. That's your department. It won't take long. A light, please. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm Mrs. Alexis Richardson. You say that like it was spelled in capital letters. Sit down. Are you telling me or asking? Please. You know, you're quite an attractive man. Keep going. How far do you want me to go? I'm at the plate. You're doing the pitching. Planning to redecorate the place, kitten. It makes the club seem more intimate. Actually, it'll accommodate another 25%. Maurice at his station. Mrs. Richardson. So, she's a fixture in the new place. How would you like to go to the cape this weekend, kid? Let's visit the Rosses. Oh, you don't really mean it, do you? Well, we haven't done that in a long time. No, we haven't. We could go out on their boat and just lazy around the sound and... what is it, kid? Nothing. Oh. Kay... I need your help. There's someone I want you to have dinner with. I'm paid to sing. I wouldn't ask you, except that Frankie Madison and I were friends. He's had a tough break and he's been away and I want to help him. But you don't ask a real friend how you can help him. You help him. But first, I've got to find out what he wants, and, well, I thought the two of you, alone, in a private dining room... The trio playing soft and sweet? Yeah. Candlelight and good champagne? Uh-huh. It should work. It worked fine on me. Well, you know how men are... give a man a girl, steak, champagne, and he's apt to open up. And you think that if he opens up, you'll be able to help him? Sure. That's why men take women to dinner, so they'll have someone to talk about themselves to. How about it? Somehow, I believe you. I'll do it. I better dress for the occasion. Good. It's something I've got to see for myself. I can't believe you really have one. One what? One friend. If you could come out here at once... it's trouble. I'll be right out. Say, it's nice of you to help out, kid. Really, it means a lot to me. Noll... Does this friend of yours come along for the boat ride, too? I'm supposed to answer that? You'd better. The answer is "no. " Just why did you sit down here? You asked me to, remember? Why? You look like a man who might have three or four interesting sentences to say. Let's face it... you've said them. Good night. Sorry. I like it here. Even you must know by now you're in the wrong place. I could say the same. The girls I knew, and some of them were plenty rough... even they never. What's the trouble, darling? Get this man out of your club now. She likes to play, but she wants to be at bat the whole game. Get this man out of here. He heard you the first time. I'm sorry this happened. I apologize. There's only one apology I want. Throw him out. How about it, dink? Do you throw me out? Please, Lex. I'll explain later, but I can't now. It's very complicated. You're hurting me. And you love it. Meet me in my office in a few minutes. Come on, Frankie. Sure, dink. That dame needed cutting down, dink. Could be. What did you whisper to her? I was being diplomatic. Dave takes care of the books. You take care of the diplomacy. What's my department, dink? That's what I wanted to tell you. Right now, it's the eating department. I've taken the liberty, Frankie. I've ordered you dinner... With a girl. The dinner, okay. But I do my own whistling. You'll have to do better than whistle for kay Lawrence. What'd you tell her about me? I told her that you were my best friend. Kay, miss Lawrence, this is Frankie Madison. Hello. Hello. It's your "welcome home" dinner. Thanks. Nice. I thought you'd like it. Maurice will take care of you now. Oh, dink? Hmm? I'm expecting a guy. Let me know when he comes, will you? Certainly, Frankie. Who is it? Nick Palestro. Nick? Remember him? Yeah. I thought you would. I'll leave word with Dan. So, you didn't tell him we bumped into each other outside. No, I didn't see any reason. Neither did I. Your hands have stopped shaking. Are you in love with him? I don't know. Dink's an easy guy to love... And an easy guy to... To what? Skip it. I'll bet... you. What did Mr. Turner order for us... steak and mushroom, lettuce-and-tomato salad, and some chocolate ice cream? Yes, sir, precisely. I thought so. Sure. That's what I always did like. But this time I figured, well, something kind of special... those things with... with fire underneath them and sauces with names I-I never could get right and... We'll have some of Henri's duck à I'orange and some broccoli hollandaise and... and some cherries jubilee to end with. And a Caesar salad to begin with? Oh, that's fine, Felix. I'll talk to Henri. He can always think of something apropos. The duck will take a little time. Thanks. Oh, it was fun, Frankie. That's a good trio, huh? Funny... all the new songs sound alike. For a song to stick, you got to be with a girl while the music's playing, and, yeah, the old songs really stick. Which old song would you like? Well, I can remember them playing, uh, "isn't it romantic?" Jimmy, see what you can do with "isn't it romantic?" You're not eating. The song... I was listening. Was she nice? Awful nice. I don't think I could like you less now. I know just what you mean, Lex. That's why you kissed me. And no fire island tomorrow... I do hate you. What's that? We go to fire island, and no arguments. I've already arranged for the house guests. Whatever you say, darling. You are so utterly no good. I should marry you. Duck à I'orange. How do you like that? Would monsieur care for a bottle of champagne... imported? Why not? It's on the house. Will you allow me to select the vintage? Thank you. What's the matter, kid... got the blues? Oh, nothing important. After all, I'm supposed to be helping you with your troubles, not bothering you with mine. What do you mean, my troubles? What did he tell you about me? Noll? Only that you're a friend he wanted to be nice to. How about you? Are you going to be nice to me? Nice in a nice way. Imported, 1933. 1933? A good year. For you, maybe. For champagne. Is something the matter? Forget it. Do you go for that stuff? Why, yes. What do you see in it? Oh, lots of things... the hole in the bottom of the bottle, the French handwriting on the label, wrapping the cloth around, fighting the cork, the pop when it comes out. It's what a woman likes. It's a buildup. It's a compliment, like flowers. What about the taste? Oh, that. The taste isn't much... after the buildup, the letdown. Something's eating you. Let's talk about something else. All right. What do you want to talk about? You. What? I've never been out with a man who didn't keep talking about himself and end up thinking he knew all about me. What do you want to know about me? Oh, the usual... who you are, what you do, where you've been, what you've been doing. At the moment, I don't do anything. Where I've been wouldn't interest you. Why not? It was dull. Whatever it was, I wish you'd tell me. Why? Because I'm interested. Skip it. All right, Frankie. Let's dance instead. I haven't danced since... A long time ago. This is the first time I've ever asked a man to dance with me. Remember, I warned you. Do you know "heart and soul," boys? Ouch! I know. You warned me. Weren't there any USOs where you were stationed? Where do you think I've been? Why, overseas, of course... maybe with the marines, when you didn't want to talk about it. Wait a minute. You made a mistake... or did you?! Are you saying you don't know? I don't know. Then I'll tell you! With the marines, huh? I'm a jailhouse marine! I been 14 years in prison! Frankie. Not just in prison, but 14 years in prison! 1933 was a good year, the guy said. Yeah, it was the year I went up the river, 14 years ago! Frankie, I'm terribly sorry. Don't be sorry for me. I sound like I'm sorry for myself? Well, I'm not! People who walk into a stone wall with their eyes wide open... they got no right to be sorry for themselves! Thank you for telling me. Why? I've been wanting, just once, to meet a man who'd tell me the truth. Sorry. I... I wanted to do that for a long time. Then it's worth an encore. If you'll forgive me, this is not the kind of man to be handled with diplomacy. You and your knowledge of people. You're a menu card who remembers 500 names and the wines they take. All right, be angry at me if you'll feel better. Still, I'd like to know what you intend to do. He'll have to make the first move, and when he does... Yes, Dan? Nick Palestro. He's asking for Frankie Madison. Tell him to wait. I'd like to give kay a little more time. That's why it took a hard guy somewhere in the setup to operate, somebody the mobs couldn't shove around. The hard guy... that was you. I was brought up in a tough neighborhood. How did you... how did I get jammed up? Mm. They hijacked me. I was riding a truck down from Canada when some of Capella's boys tried to knock me over. Here, let me show you. Now, this is the border between Canada and New York state. I used to be able to draw a map of every little road across, and the littler the road, the better. But this was the road we used most. It was potato country. There were a lot of trucks on the road hauling potatoes, but we were hauling rye. I guess we're in the clear now. In this racket, you're never in the clear. Want me to take the wheel for a while? Later. What's that? Hijackers! What do we do now? Hang on. They cracked up. Step on it. We're in the clear now. Yeah, after waking up every cop this side of the border. Look, we'd better split up. Why? Well, it gives us twice the chance. One of us is sure to get clear. Then he helps the other one. Right. Get ready to hop off. I'll stick with the load. Look, Frankie, if they get me, I want Hayes for a lawyer. Keep the four kings going till I get out, and I'll have someplace to come to. Right. I'll do the same thing for you... everything will be 50/50, Frankie. Everything will be 50/50, dink. Right! The rest is cut and dried. Noll got away... I didn't. I took the rap, and here I am. We shook hands on it. So, you see, everything is 50/50. We're partners. Yes, I see, all right. Maybe you'll be working for me from now on. Take an order... breakfast with the boss after the late show. Frankie, we've had fun. Let's let it go at that. Why? I've been singing around this town for six years. In that time, I've learned more than just how to put a song over. Yeah? I've been around. I've learned to play every kind of angle there is except maybe the right angle. Don't worry about me, kid. I just got out of prison, not college. There is a man waiting to see you, Mr. Madison, in the bar. Thanks. Kay, I... You go ahead, Frankie. I've got to change for the after-theater show, anyhow. Sure. Nick! Frankie. Hey. I've been waiting. Long? Yeah. They didn't tell me till just now. Well, I don't like waiting here. I'm a 3rd Avenue boy. I like my 3rd Avenue spots. I hear you've been doing all right since you got out. I'm making out. Good. Well, not to rush you, Frankie, but I got to get back to my used-car lot. At night? Mm-hmm. What did you have in mind? I want some information, maybe a little help later on. My pleasure. Why didn't you tell me he'd been in prison? I wanted to see if he'd tell you himself. If he did, I knew he'd tell you everything. What's going on in that mind of yours? I told you... I want to help Frankie. That sounds good. Frankie's my friend. You don't believe me. But Frankie does. 50/50 on everything... that's what you told him. You made a bargain. Why don't you live up to it? I don't think I ever quite realized... you're like Frankie. You're sentimental. Perhaps I've sung too many torch songs. Perhaps. Good luck, Frankie. So, Frankie expects to be 50/50, does he? That's what the man said. You found out what I had to know. Thanks. See anybody there that looks like Frankie? You never will. Nice talk you toss at me, dink. "Have a drink, Frankie, some champagne, dinner with a girl," but not one word about what I'm listening for. The oldest trick in the world... you want to pump a guy, use a woman. And I grab. All right, Frankie. I was trying to pump you. Noll asked me to have dinner with you because he said he wanted to help you. To help himself. I know how he'd like to help me, and you're in on it. Well? What kind of news did your pigeon bring back? Look, Frankie, we have some business. Let's settle it like businessmen. All right. Yes, Noll? Dave, bring in the Madison file. Okay. We had an understanding, you and I. Sure, we had an understanding. We shook hands on it. Come in. Let me have the file. This is a photostat, Frankie... the dissolution of partnership, the four kings club. What?! That was the agreement... 50/50 on the four kings and nothing else. This looks like one of those papers you kept bringing me to sign, Dave. Yes, Frankie. But you told me it was a lot of rigmarole. It didn't mean nothing. I didn't have to bother reading them. Why didn't you tell me? Why?! Ah, you can't blame Dave, Frankie. After repeal, the four kings started losing money. We had to sell. You were away. You wouldn't understand conditions. So what?! I didn't just padlock the four kings and move up here. There were some tough years in between. I should have sent you cigarettes! All right, I'll get to the point. There was a little money left when I closed up the four kings. Half of it was yours. Dave, how much does Frankie have coming to him? With interest added at 6%, $2,912. Are you trying to tell me I don't own any part of this place? How can you collect on a race when you don't hold a ticket? For good measure, $3,000. Here's your half of the four kings, Frankie. Marked "paid in full. " That's right. By my figuring, wrong. Well, there's no mistake. Dave's a good accountant. Dave's a good accountant, all right, but there's one figure he forgot to add in. What's that? The 14 years. He left out the 14 years I gave you. 14 years to be out in the sunshine, eat good, sleep good! What's 6% of that?! What a fall guy I am... three of a kind. Anything more now? No, Dave. Thanks. Here. Is your mouth cut inside? I don't think so. You can hold the ice yourself. Just how low do you think I am? Use me on Frankie like... like you use a bar girl to make a man buy drinks. A stool pigeon, he said... well, he was right. Kay, it's about time for you to go on. You'd better change. Is it time, or is it because you pushed the buzzer? You don't have to buzz to get rid of me, darling. Just say the word. I'm gonna need you sooner than I figured, Nick. I want five or six good boys. Get them over to my hotel as soon as you can.

" I'm sorry, but I don't think I know the words to that. You ought to learn them. Perhaps I'd better start right now. Don, no encore. Henri... Oui, monsieur. Ah. Merci Bien, Henri. That's French. Yeah. Means "thanks. " Huh? Okay, then. Now, Merci Bien. Look, I'm a little too busy tonight for jokes, kid. If something's eating you, why don't you say it? I'd like to... privately. Mrs. Richardson just asked me to learn the words to "I lost my man. " She wants me to marry her, kay. Are you going to? Yes. I don't love her. I love you. You love me, but you're marrying her? Mm-hmm. Forgive me if I don't understand. There's a lot of things you have to do for business, kay. She puts the club in the upper bracket... not with money, but with a blue book, and that's real security. It doesn't have to change anything with you and me. What did you say? I said it doesn't have to change anything with you and me. It's changed already... everything has, from the minute you spoke those words. Oh, let's act grown-up about this, kay. Now, we make sense together. Do we? Now that I think of it, we've never made sense together. For four years, I've watched you grow more and more in love with the nightclub. It used to frighten me. Now it just makes me sick. That love is worry, manipulation, and care. That's what made this club a success, a big business. Big business? It's a place where people come because they don't want to go to bed. It's a place where women come to show off their new bracelets and cheats try to forget over a scotch and soda. It's exactly like you are now... exactly! Anything else? Yes. I'm quitting. But just for the book, you're firing me, because I want that week's pay. You're in Frankie's league now. I couldn't ask for better company. Frankie... ...Dave told me where you were staying. They don't care who they let in around here. You can tell Noll... Noll didn't send me. Then what are you doing here? Listen, Frankie, let's not fight. Please, I'm too tired for that. I just wanted to explain. Noll asked me to have dinner with you. He wanted me to get you to talk about yourself because he said he wanted to help you. I should have realized the only thing noll ever built up was the regent club. Everything else, he tears apart. I'm sorry I was a party to it, Frankie. I only know how I feel. I only know I had to come to see you to explain. I could use one of your handkerchiefs. Frankie... One thing. What? Noll is going to marry Mrs. Richardson. I thought he would. I thought he would, too. I'm glad. It... it might take me a little time to get him out of my system. One gets kind of used to someone. Where's the rest of them? That's all there is, Frankie. I said five, six boys. With short notice. What's happened to the old mob? The old mob's busted up, Frankie. They're dead. They're gone or in the big dough... all but heinz. Not so easy to find a guy that needs a buck nowadays. What's your name? Class. Wait a minute, Frankie. He's a kid. Smart idea, Frankie. Working from the inside, huh? The boy here... Skinner. Heinz. Hi. Tiger rose. Nick explain the caper? It won't be easy. You're not kidding. Muscling in on a joint like that... be like taking grand central station. Wait a minute. Who said anything about muscling in? Our partner... he said he was. He said? I could say I'm the mayor. If everything clicks, you'll get your cut. As long as I get my cut, why should I noodle? For a buck, you'd double-cross your own mother. Why not? She'd do the same to me. You and the boys go over to the club now. Look over the layout. I'll tell you what to do when I get there. You don't have to tell me what to do. And I'll tell him. I'll come over just before closing, when the joint's thinned out. Right. Come on, boys. If you ever give him the pitch... Hands off. You, better than me? Come on, tiger. Round 2 coming up. Like I said, Frankie, nobody's hungry. Yeah. Thanks. I'll see you. My pleasure. Kay... What do you want me to say, Frankie? I don't know. I don't want any part of it. It's Noll you're worried about. You said you hadn't got him out of your system. It's you I'm worried about. Once you use that gun, you'll have a gun in your hand the rest of your life. That's not for me. I like you too much, Frankie. Hello, Frankie. Dan. Right. Okay, Dan. Get Ben and mossy to stand by. Dave, come in here and bring the books... the "a" set. Yes, Noll. There's carrion lounging in the regent bar. What are you thinking of? I should get rid of them, call the police. You would. And get rid of nothing. It's got to be settled once and for all. What a layout. Nick Palestro you know. The rest of my boys you don't, but you know what they are. You gentlemen care for a drink? Yeah, swell. Maurice, would you do the honors? Stay where you are, mouse-face. You shuffled the cards, but now it's my deal. There's only one way to handle you. Kill me? If I have to, yeah. A guy's got to fight for what's his. Right here, Dave. Hello, Frankie. Nick. Hello, Dave. Get him out of here. He knows all my business. He stays. You and your boys... this isn't the four kings... no hiding out behind a steel door and a peephole. This is big business. We deal with banks, lawyers, and a dun & bradstreet rating. The world's spun right past you, Frankie. In the '20s, you were great. In the '30s, you might have made the switch, but today you're finished... as dead as the headlines the day you went into prison. Nick? Yeah? Ready? Yeah. Heinz? Set. Skinner? Yeah. That's what I'm getting my fee for. Dink, you've got one minute. One minute for what? You know what... to cut me in for what I own, the half that belongs to me. Well, now, listen, Frankie... 30 seconds, dink. Well, I couldn't tell you it's half yours if I wanted to. 18 seconds. But if I did, I'd be lying. I can tell to the second, dink. Comes from lying on a cot, counting them, waiting for something to happen. 11 seconds. But there's nothing you can take over. 4... But if that's what you want, it's all right with me. You see, Nick? He had to be smoked out. Now, hand it over. Well, it's not that simple, Frankie. Ask Dave. That's why I had him in here. All right, start talking. Well, the regent club, Frankie, is controlled by three corporations... regent incorporated, regent enterprises, and regent associates. I don't care what kind of regent you call it. What's dink's in? Well, it's not that easy to explain, Frankie. For instance, the fixtures and furniture... that's the property of regent incorporated. The equipment, on the other hand, belongs to regent enterprises. Now, regent associates... I'll diagram it for you. Regent associates... stop trying to dizzy me up. Here. Now, I want simple answers, Dave... no diagrams. Dink's got the full say around here, right? Yes. Okay, then. Except that it's revocable by a vote of the board of directors of regent associates. Stop the double-talk. I'm sorry, Frankie. Just what does dink own?! In which corporation? Take them one by one. Now, regent associates is a sort of holding company, a desk. A desk?! Yes. It owns 51% of regent enterprises. And is that a desk? No, that's the corporation which provided you with a good dinner, music, and champagne tonight. And the company, too? Oh, no. Kay's paid by I.N.C. Regent enterprises is a service company. It owns such assets as silverware, linen, glasses... now we're getting somewhere. This is the McCoy, the stuff that counts... the silver, the liquor, and the cellar. What's the matter now? The liquor... that's regent incorporated. You're right back where you started from. Shut up! Brother, they've got you swimming in it. Yeah? Associates... that's a desk. Enterprise is a service company. That leaves regent incorporated, and that must be the big one. How much does dink own in that? 17%. You mean to say that a guy with 17% can hire and fire waiters and musicians? What are you handing me?! Waiters and musicians... that's, uh, regent enterprises. Absolutely swimming in it. I'm through swimming. I know what I want... write out a paper that gives me half of everything you own. You can transfer half the stock to me. No. Why not?! According to article 6 in the articles of incorporation, filed with the secretary of state in Albany, no stock can be transferred without the consent of the board of directors. And in the bylaws. Yes, in the bylaws passed at the first corporate meeting, which provided that the manager must hold at least 162/3% of the company. Half of Noll's 17% would only give you 81/2%. It's not enough. You did this to me, Dave... you. It's the usual setup for clubs like the regent club, Frankie. You cooked this up! You put together all this paper I can't swim through! Okay, we move in. We take over right now! You heard what I said! I'm giving the orders around here! I'm afraid there's no boss here, Frankie... not you, not now. I told you, Frankie... the old days are gone, and you're gone with them. I'm sorry about all this, Mr. Turner. That's all right. Drop in some time, and I'll buy you a drink. Yeah, swell. And Nick said you were better than me. Come on, tiger. End of the round. I don't get what happened. It won't be the first punch you didn't see coming. It's like my used-car lot, Frankie. I got a piece of it. My wife's got a piece of it. My brother-in-law never worked a day in his life. He's got a piece of it, too. It's on account of the taxes, Frankie. Get out of here. You did this to me, Dave... yeah, you! When I asked you to my hotel room, you were afraid. I was right. You were afraid, but you weren't a-scared of dink. You were scared of me! You knew what you'd done... cheating me, one cross after another! Dave, I'm gonna kill you! So help me, I'll rip you apart! Thanks, Dan. Frisk him. No gun. Frankie, don't you think you've caused enough trouble around here? I've got him mugged, Mr. Turner. He can't talk. There's only one way to treat you. I'm gonna have some sense beaten into you. And I hope that works, because if it doesn't and you come around here again, I'll have you beaten up and thrown out again and again until you crawl. All right, Dan. Take it easy, Frankie. The way I got you, if you fight against it, your windpipe will be crushed. Dave, take the ledgers with you and check them against your duplicates. Dave is a lot of brains but not much stomach. All right, Noll. You won. But don't push things too hard. This can only lead to trouble. Frankie's got it coming to him. It's because he cut your mouth and hurt your pride. You've said your 5% worth. Get back to your station. Ohh! Grab his feet. See how he got up and that right he caught me with? He really rocked me. I always liked the guy. 15 years ago, he was the best there was. So what?

Where's Frankie? I don't know. Where is he? Oh, Frankie's not for you, kitten. He's broken. He's bound to land back in prison. I've been in prison the past four years. I'm just getting out, so I know how he feels. Ooh. You went flat on that note. Where is he? I had him thrown out into the alley, where he belongs. If you've hurt him, Noll... I'm sorry, Frankie. I'm so sorry. I know, Dave. You see, Frankie, I had to do it. Frankie. Frankie. I don't want her to see me like this. It doesn't matter how I see you, just so I see you. It's not as bad as it looks. Of course. You'll need some bandages. Your hands are shaking again. Yes, Frankie. Take him to his hotel room, kay. I'm gonna see Noll. We'll make out, Dave. I'm sorry I shot my mouth off about killing you and all. I know you just put the numbers into the books. You don't make them up. That's all right, Frankie. Books don't balance any more anyhow. I'll see you at your hotel room later. I got a lot more to tell you. Okay. I'll see you there. We'd better go to my place. I've got some stuff that'll fix you up. Then we'll go to your hotel and meet Dave. I didn't know you could take it like this, kid. There are a lot of things I didn't know about myself, Frankie. But I'm learning. Now, come on. Yes? Mrs. Richardson calling. Hello, Lex. Hello, darling. I'm up at your house place in Westport with a million people. How long will it take you to drive back? I'm not driving back, Noll. I'm staying here. You come up. Oh, fine, after I made all my plans, gave my servants the weekend off, and... Come up tomorrow, first thing. Why not tonight? Because tonight I'm going to sit with Charles and may even let him make love to me. I'll see if I get any reaction. I'll let you know in the morning. Good night. Good night, darling. Tramp. What do you want? They beat him up fine, Noll. I already got my report from Dan. Oh, before I forget, give me back my pen and clear up the mess here. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. When I saw Frankie take his beating, I got my stomach full, 100% full. There's not a fraction left for anything else. Not even a little forgery? No. I seem to remember having three checks in my vault with my name forged... not too well... by you before I hired you. You don't seem to understand, Noll. There's not even enough room for me to be afraid any more. You could send me to prison, sure. No court would understand, I know, but I think Frankie will when I tell him about the year and a half I spent before I forged those checks and how I've spent the years since then. As long as Frankie understands, that's all I care about. Just what do you think you're going to do? Help Frankie. How are you gonna help him? I built this setup, Noll, and I think I can tear it down again... maybe not, but I can give it a try. After all, there's one or two things, like our "b" set of books that no one has ever seen except you and me. Don't threaten me. You know, Noll... I think you're afraid now, and I'm not. Frankie with his bootlegged liquor, me with those checks I forged, you with this setup here... everyone trying to get something for nothing. Frankie paid. I paid. It's your turn now. Mr. Madison doesn't answer. Any message? Ring him again, would you, please? It's very important. No answer. Sorry. Thank you. Frankie? Yeah? What did you do with that gun? I better get moving. Where? I don't know. For 14 years, I thought I knew, but now... Now I don't. You'll find a new place. I got no plans. Ain't got much of anything. You're sounding pretty sorry for yourself, Frankie. I just got beat up good. Sure, it was tough, but you've faced a lot tougher. That ain't the beating I feel. You're not the only one. What do you think my life's been? You? You've got everything. Including a nice big hole where I used to have a heart. Noll tore that out of me. So, you see, I took a beating tonight, too. You'll do fine. I guarantee you... you'll do fine. The only reason I'll do fine is because I've got sense enough to pull myself together and face the facts. Sure, Noll handed me a rough deal. I don't like it. But I'm going to turn it into something that does me good. I'm not letting Noll Turner win all the way around. It's okay for you, but it don't work for me. No, Frankie, I don't think it does, either. I think he's won, hands down. When I first saw you, I-I thought you were a man of some strength... not only in your hands, but in your eyes and in your head. Yes, I think Noll Turner beat you because he's stronger than you are. Shut up. Not much of a man for the truth, are you? Hurts to have the facts where you can see them. Or are they facts? I said, "shut up"! Sure, I'll shut up. I haven't anything more to say to you. Think it over, Frankie. Then you can leave if you like. How come you know so well how to take care of a beat-up guy? Experience. My father used to get himself beat up every Saturday night. I'd wait up until they brought him home. But I never blamed him, Frankie. You see, my mother died after they'd only been married three years. Michael was the kind of guy who needed a woman to love him. You know, some men are like that. Without their woman, they're like a ship floundering without a rudder. They... I know what you mean. And just what did Madison say? He said, "Dave, I'll kill you. So help me, I'll kill you. " And then you threw him out? Frankie was so wild, looked like he'd kill Dave right there. I had to get a little rough with him. And Madison said that Dave cheated him, huh? I'd rather not say. Why not? Well, Frankie and I were... he was my best friend. Oh, sure, I understand how you feel. Oh, well. It's a clear enough case, anyway. Schreiber, start with his hotel and the girl's place, radio a pickup order, get his picture in the paper, station, highway check, and the rest of it. Yes, sir. Let's take a cab. Let's walk. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. Will Dave still be waiting at the hotel? Sure. Nothing can stop him. Hey, let's stop at a drugstore and buy him a new pen. If I know Noll, he took back the other one. And you know Noll. Yeah, I guess I do. You know, sometimes I found myself wondering what I'd do for a living if Noll didn't come through. And what did you think? Well, I thought I'd find myself a smart, new angle. Oh, I see. But now I don't know. Seeing that guy Skinner stopped me cold. Why? Listen. What? Police siren. You never even noticed it. One hears so many. Whenever I hear one, I think of the guy they're after. I never again want that guy to be me, kay. Of all the guys I knew fighting the law, not one of them ever grew old. Skinner won't. And I want to. Come on. Let's see what all the excitement's about. Sure, if you want. You mean you don't want to? I guess you've had enough of that kind of excitement. We can get Dave's pen here. Frankie Madison... still at large, wanted for murder. Morning times! 3 bits! Extra! Extra! Read all about the murder! A man kills his pal! Extra! Get your morning paper! Extra! Get your morning paper! Read all about the murder! Extra! Buy a paper and meet me down the block. Morning paper! Extra! Extra! Extra! Read all about the big murder! Extra! Morning paper! Frankie Madison wanted by the police! Extra! Extra! Read all about the big murder! Frankie Madison wanted for murder! Extra! Kay! Extra! Extra! Extra! Extra! Frankie... Dave's dead. Two shots in the back? Noll, all right. Noll? But... but why? Remember what Dave told us in the alley... the books don't balance? He went to tell Noll he was through. But why didn't he tell me? Why did the poor guy have to get himself jammed? I've got to get to Noll and get the truth out of him. Yes. Where would he be? The club's closed. He'd be home. Do you know how to get there? Yes. He lives in Jersey, the... the Millbank road, the last house on the Lane. We'll need a car. Nick Palestro... his used-car lot's open all night. We... no, we can't do that. He'd be watched. Well, can I phone him? Wait a minute. Yeah. Tell him to leave a car outside the old church. Will he understand? Nick will remember the old church. We used it on a particular job once. And pick me up here after you phone him. Right. Frankie... We'll make out, kay. Keeping clear of the police is one thing I know. But... and I'll make Noll talk. Yes, Frankie. Whatever you say. This is the place, isn't it? Then Nick didn't remember. He didn't leave a car here. Yep, he did. The taxi? Nick thinks of everything. How will we get by the police on the bridge? I'll tell you as we go along. What goes with her? I don't know. There was some guy with her when she got in. The nerve of some guys. Nice work, kid. You sure can cry. I was thinking about Dave. Not a light on. He's home. That's his car. Can you drive it? Yes. What do we do now? The bigger the house, the more chance the front door is open. Locked. Maybe we can try one of the windows. Yes? Greetings. I heard you drive up. Come in. Sure. Let's go into the library, kay. Frankie, keep your hands out of your pocket. Dink... Who killed Dave? Why, you did. Didn't you know? It's been on the radio and in all the papers. Frankie, you're wanted for murder. It's my duty to call the police. I'm sorry, of course, but... Take your hand off that phone. Frankie, I have the gun. And that's why you went haywire. When it comes to stocks and papers and books that don't balance, you're better than me. When it comes to guns, you're down on my level. Maybe you'd better call the cops. They'd be interested in what Dave told me in the alley after the working over you gave me. Oh, that was just before you killed him. Try again, dink. Remember, you're down on my level now. You made it just like the old days. When it comes to guns and tricks, you never could score. I was always quicker. Go ahead. Call the cops. That's what you started to do, wasn't it? Stay where you are, or I'll shoot. Frankie! You'd like that, dink, wouldn't you? It would straighten out a lot of things... and me out of the way, just like Dave, nobody to remember what he said. Stop it, Frankie! You'll have to do away with both of us, because I'm Frankie's alibi. I know Frankie's not guilty. I found him in the alley where you had him thrown after the beating. Dave was with him. After Dave left, I took Frankie to my apartment. The desk man saw us go in. The elevator boy took us up to the floor. They both saw us leave later, after Dave was murdered. That's a pretty tight alibi, Noll. Your hands are sweating, dink. When you pull the trigger, your finger will slip it. Missed, dink. You've only got five shots left. You all right, kay? Yes, Frankie. You're pretty rookie, dink. I only threw a book at the door. You got three shots left. Two shots left, dink. You ought to be more careful. It's hard to hit the sound of a voice in the dark. Remember, dink? This is just like that night at the brunswick lager warehouse, down by the river. That was the night Ali Marafi tried to hijack us, dink. Remember what I did when he had me covered? I remember, all right. You tipped a table over on him, Frankie. And took his gun away from him, dink. I thought you'd remember. Frankie. Frankie. Frankie, are you all right? Kay, turn on the lights. Easy, dink. Remember, this way, if you struggle, you get your windpipe crushed. I want that gun. I only need one shot. Well... What now? What do you think? I don't know. You're slipping, dink. Don't you even remember that? Now we go for the ride. You wouldn't kill me. You'd only be worse off. Who killed Dave? And don't say I did! I don't know. Let's ride, dink. Familiar country. It was around here they found Walt Werner. They took gasoline from the car and set him on fire. When they found him, he was still burning. Where are we going? Look, kay, I know I've been rotten to you, but make Frankie see killing me won't help. It'll make it worse for him and for you, too. Look, if you want Frankie, all right, but, kitten, for all we've been to each other... Kay, please, stop him. Who killed Dave? Frankie? Don't worry about the bridge, kay. They're trying to stop me from getting out of the city. They won't be looking for me to come back in... Unless dink talks. Let dink pay. It's his ride. Thanks. Who's there? Oh, it's you, Mr. Turner. I was just finishing up my rounds. Anything I can do for you before I go? There's nothing he can do, is there, dink? No. Thanks, Mr. Turner. Thanks, ed. To your office, dink. Kay, do something. I am doing something. I'm wondering who killed Dave. Where's the safe? Frankie, you can have anything... anything. I'll transfer everything to you. You can't do that. Well, why not? I... it's in the bylaws... no stocks can be transferred without the consent of the board of directors. But where's the safe? Take out the cash. Count out $2,912. You can have more... all you want. I only want what you said I had coming to me. Now, count. I thought you'd get it back from Dave. Write out a receipt. "Received from Noll Turner... "$2,912... Paid in full. " And I'll sign it. Now... Walk over there. No, Frankie. No, don't. Walk. K-kay, p-please stop him. He's... Don't do it, Frankie. He's not worth it. Give me 10 minutes. Then call the homicide squad. Wait for me here and keep the door shut. What are you gonna do? It's all right, baby. Yes, Frankie. Dink... Go ahead. Now... Who killed Dave? I don't know. Who killed him? All right, I had to do it! He was crossing me. I had to have him killed! You shouldn't have done that, dink... not to Dave. Here. Write out just how you did it on the back of this. You like everything legal, remember? Remember, dink? Remember what? Remember where we found Dutch roth? That's right... Dutch was frozen solid. These pens are great. They write anyplace... underwater, up in planes. I'll bet they'd even write in the freezer. I'm gonna put you in there, dink. If you can write out a confession before you freeze to death, I'll let you out. Dutch roth. Remember how he looked, dink? So, you had Skinner do it, huh? All right, Madison. Schreiber. Madison, I've got a warrant for... and I've got a confession. What about this confession, Mr. Turner? Why, it's not worth the ink it took to write it. Why not? I signed at the point of a gun. He threatened my life unless I signed it. He's got a gun on him, lieutenant. Schreiber? Nothing on him but some money. He's got a gun in his pocket! You remembered Ali Marafi, but you forgot the simplest trick of them all... the fountain-pen gag. You pulled it on me the first time we met. That's one thing I learned from you, dink. No, he's got a gun. You don't think I'd sign a thing like that unless he had a gun! Nothing on him but the money. I tell you... and a pen I bought for Dave. But I never got a chance to deliver it. No, no, he... get yourself a lawyer, dink. Maybe he can enter a plea like Hayes did for me. You might get off with 14 years. But he's got a gun... L-listen, Hollaran, I tell you, he tried to trick me. Pick up Skinner. You better come along, Turner. No, he tried to get my club away from me... the regent club! I'll be back in a minute, Madison. Just a few questions. Come on. You boys mind if I have a little farewell drink? No, go ahead. Will you join me? No thanks. Don't make any moves. I got nothing against you fellas, but I got a score to settle with Frankie Madison. Where is the gun, Frankie? In the bushes near Noll's house. Then all the time, all the way down here, you... I've learned something, kay... I've learned why I'll never use a gun again. Look out! He's got a gun! Well, here we are... no strings attached and no place to go. And nothing to stop us. We can go anywhere we wish, Frankie. If it's together. It is.
