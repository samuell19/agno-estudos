Once upon a time there was a wonderful land called France. Through the spyglass, you see the 18th century in full swing. The people were happy, the women easy, and men indulged in their favourite hobby: war. The only sport of kings which the people could play as well. But which glorious battle is this? No matter. Aren't all battles alike in being warlike? Battlefields are places of posterity, providing history for pupils. "Auvergne, the enemy's coming.“ "My kingdom for a horse." “Kiss me, Hardy.“ “Shoot, gentlemen.“ Death but no surrender. Louis XV speaking borrowed words. Louis XV the Beloved, with his many favourites. He may sometimes lose his hat, but never his head. With roses on their guns and smiles on their lips, the regiments of Picardy, Aquitaine and Burgundy fought elegantly, killing with grace and disembowelling with style. Choreographed like a ballet, this was the Lace War. His Majesty's soldiers found this war so amusing that they made it last seven years. When the dead outnumbered the living, reinforcement was advisable. Recruiting sergeants took to the roads of France to scout the remotest villages for prospects. Live without worries, die without regrets. No need to think, the King will do it for you. Don't hesitate, enlist and win yourself preference. Come closer... closer... closer! Enlist in the glorious regiment of Aquitaine. Guillot! Guillot! What do you want with Guillot? You daughter's being tumbled. - My daughter? - No need to ask by whom. That wretch. If I catch him, I'll bleed him like a chicken, gut him like a pig. God'll forgive me. Let's go. Ignorant louts! I talk about war and they run away. Here it is. Where? I don't see anything. Behind one of the haystacks, but I don't know which. Let's get on with it. Come on. I've got them both. Proud of yourself? - Stay down. - A man! At your age, Marion. Aren't you ashamed? She's the perfect age, you halfwit. Oh, God, my father. There you are, little rascal, bandit, scoundrel. You, come here. Will you cover yourself and stop flaunting what God gave you? You little slut! I thought you were at confession. She couldn't confess before sinning. Your Parisian airs won't get you out of this. What have I done wrong? Marion is beautiful and desirable. She didn't know it. I showed her she could please. Right, Marion? - You're just a fine talker. - Arrogant. - A foreigner. - He's not one of us. Why did you come here? Where were you? In Paris loafing all day in cabarets? Your uncle should have had an accident the day he took you in. All you do is rattle your sword and rape girls! - Let me at him. - Calm down, Guillot. I'll be respectfully obliged to tickle your ribs. I'll squash you. Careful, squashing me may not be so easy. Keep your distance. Show some respect to your future father-in-law. Future farther-in-law? Are you joking? You reap what you sow. You marry Marion, or I'm a jackass. Unfortunately, I won't marry her. She will be your wife. Don't worry, Marion. I won't marry you. I swear on your father's horns. Son of a... Gentlemen, I bid you farewell. - Why have you been arrested? - To end my adventures. - What crime did you commit? - Premeditated love. That's no crime. It is when you're a recidivist. Where are they taking you? To be tortured. To marry me. - A good-looking boy like yourself? - To carry on the line. - Faster. - I was happy. I was free. Now my life is over with what's in store. What's in store? Let me tell you. Give me your hand. I've decided he'll be my son-in-law and he'll obey me. You will not marry tomorrow. I see wonderful adventures, signs of fortune and fame, a resplendent uniform, a fiery horse, a wild audacity. You'll be a glorious soldier. His Majesty will name him field marshal. I'll kick him in the rear. Here's the love line. Forgive my familiarity and impertinence, My Lord. What are you saying? The King's daughter loves you. The King's daughter loves me? She does and you'll marry her. The King's daughter? But... how will I know her? Intimately. I didn't know I was king. Because tomorrow you'll marry Marion. The King's daughter, why not? She looks charming. - Come on, let's go. - You... Some day... I'll have you beaten by my lackeys. No need to think, the King'll do it for you. Don't hesitate, enlist and you'll be considered... Consider me enlisted. - Just a minute. - It'll be too late. Your bounty. Now glory, the King and the Princess. To the King! To the King! Have your friends come to enlist too? No, they're after a deserter. Get ready for a beating, scoundrel. Get back. Let me pull his ears. Threats. How dare you insult a soldier of the King. I insult no one. But this good-for-nothing belongs to me. Will" His signature's worth nothing. He's committed to marry my daughter. Let her wait a while. He'll be back in seven years. Listen, Fanfan, if Marion doesn't marry, I'll break you. Marion is charming enough to marry without me. Let's find her a suitor. Hands up anyone who'll marry her. First come, first served. Hurry up. No offers on the left? On the right? This is my last word. I'll offer my bounty as dowry. Who volunteers? May the best man win. You didn't expect to find me here. - What are you doing here? - Imbecile. Don't you get it? I'm Sergeant La Franchise's daughter. A damned Wench she is too. She got me drunk and said the King would give me land. Same with him. She said I'll be the General's aide. I believed her, of course. She's a gypsy. She didn't lie to me. She told me what I already knew. I know my future as if I had lived it. You believed me? My destiny will be as you foretold and as I've decided. No doubt. I shall marry the King's daughter. Poor fool. Have you no faith in yourself? Am I not a soldier as you predicted? But you didn't predict I would hate the regiment because of you, and your father would lose his recruiting money because I'm off to join Picardy. No way, little man. I don't work for my competitors. - One move and I'll split you. - Just try it! What a sad day. The sky is low, the weather dreary. Oh, it's only you. Were you asleep? - I was dreaming. - Really. What a dream. You were being tortured. Tortured? You were publicly flogged like a witch. You were almost naked, a bit plump for my taste, with amusing dimples on certain parts of your anatomy. Shut up. Don't be so vulgar. You were squirming like an eel. You were in tears, asking for mercy. I was there in the front row, with Her Majesty, my wife. I could have given you mercy, but I didn't. Let me go back to sleep to see the end of my dream. No, get up! No dreaming around here. My pleasure. Looks like I'm still tied up. So free am I that I don't feel my bonds. - Thank you, Adeline. - What? I'm not fooled by your tact. Thank you, Adeline. Did you not fear, in loyal deceit, to leave beside me, as though by chance, all accessories for my escape. This sword, knife, pistol. Thank you, Adeline. You wished me to believe my escape to be my own effort. I have seized the opportunity. Thank you. Freely I shall remain your prisoner. Thank you, Adeline. You see, I trust you. I reveal all my secrets to you. Thank you, Adeline. Thank you. Help! Help! Not that way, there's danger. Everyone in the bushes. Come on, let's go. I'll lose my bounty if you all end up dead. Hello there, maidens. Do I have to kick you out? Maidens, if you will, but to be treated with civility. Your hand, thank you. Her Highness, Henriette of France. Hello, Henriette. I'll take this and this. Let's move. - You're Madame de Pompadour. - So I am. You're a despicable coward. Be quiet or they'll hear us, imbecile. Imbecile? Here I am! Go and you'll be a deserter. Keep away or I'll run you through. He'll get himself killed. My bounty. My bounty! He'll cheat me out of it, the rogue. Sir, you were wonderful. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. You're as bold as you are brave. And very young- I've always been young for my age. That raised a bit of a sweat. For a greenhorn, that wasn't bad at all, my lad. But you still lack skill and experience. He's our scout. If he were in danger, we would have intervened. You, you certainly have no fears. More are coming. Never fear. I'll handle them. No, they're our men. That's too bad. How handsome they are. Just look at them. Well, cowards... Proud of yourselves? Come, take your places. I'll deal with you tonight. We're well protected. They were brave to return. - Here, this is yours. - You keep it, a prize of war. I beg you, don't mar my pleasure. I've already been greatly rewarded. Here! For allowing me to earn the two sweetest kisses ever. I'm as happy as if the King's daughter had kissed me. - Yet... - And yet... - What's your name? - Fanfan. What else? Soldier of the King. I'll be a soldier of the King. Very well, Fanfan. Take this tulip as a souvenir of me. May it bring you good luck. But madam... Goodbye, Fanfan La Tulipe. Goodbye, fairy godmother. They nabbed Her Highness. The coach is gone. Sergeant, have you seen a coach? - A coach? - Her Highness's coach. - Driven by four horses? - Yes, seen it? - Her Highness in person? - With Mme de Pompadour. Madame de Pompadour and the King's daughter. - We saw it. It went that way. - The bandits? You'll find the bandits a bit further on. I've cooled them off. - What did you say? - The truth. We cut them down, and Her Highness went on her way. - Take this for the trouble. - Thank you. The King's daughter. The King's daughter kissed me. Is that so strange? Isn't she your wife-to-be? AQUITAINE REGIMENT We now witness the moving ceremony of induction. The new recruits discover the army to be one big family. Line up! Come closer. Who recruited such nitwits? Just look at these cretins. Come on. I hope your recruits are bright and bursting with life... and ready to die if need be. Just look. - The size seems right. - Five feet and one inch. The eye is bright, the hair well-rooted, the teeth sound. You, smile. Thank you. A four-leaf clover. Luck is at your feet, my friend. - Your name. - Fanfan La Tulipe. La Tulipe? Now, there's a fine nickname. We have a Larkspur, a Meadowsweet, a Buttercup. This isn't a regiment, it's a flower-bed. What's this? From Madame de Pompadour. For saving the King's daughter's life. - You saved Her Highness? - Yes, from bandits. Compliments. Her Highness allowed you to kiss her? Naturally, I'm to marry her. Adeline's prediction. Funny. Very funny. Credulity is the main strength of an army. Mirth, Fier à Bras, not irony. It's the prerogative of superiors. Do I amuse you? I can easily kill another rogue. We're among soldiers here, not rogues. Welcome, my lads. I'm your captain. In short, I'll love to command and you'll be pleased to obey. You're now soldiers of the King. Be worthy of the honour. Swords disengaged. Swords high! Swords in place. Pistols in hand. Pistols ready. Ready. Fire. Flex. Extend. Down. Flex. Extend. Extend... Extend. Down. Flex. Extend. Down. Swords disengaged. Swords high. Swords in place. On your knees. Down. Up! On your knees. Down. Up! Where do you think you're going, trooper? Silly and odious. That's how I find this exercise. - Who are you talking to? - You, sergeant-major. I'll tame you. Don't forget I've killed three horses. Alas, the best always go first. Insubordination, desertion. Tranche-Montagne, take this man to the cell immediately. You'll know my name, cretin! What a nice name. Shall we go? Let's. I'll deal with you later. You, get up. On your knees. Down. Up. Don't hold it against me. I'm taking you to prison. A chance to take a stroll. The pleasure's all mine. - I should have pulled his ears. - Yeah! Be quiet. You'd be a dead man. He's a real cutthroat with his sword. - Last year he killed three recruits. - Damaging the goods. You're hot-blooded. Take care. I used to be like that, couldn't contain myself. Now I have eight kids. The anger gone, I had another mouth to feed. Here we are. I'll tell my wife to bring you a jug of wine. You'll sleep just as well here. With the captain, show remorse. Remorse? Never. I'm the King's daughter's fiancé. There he goes again. Get some rest, may it wise you up. Come on kids, let's go. Well, are you proud of yourself? That madman could put you in the galleys for ten years. I'm better off ten years in the galleys than seven in the army. Come here! Listen to me. Did they trap you into this? No, I'm wary of Fier à Bras. Why? Has he authority over you? No, but he's courting me. And you humour him? I don't want such an enemy. You fear him? Yet you and men... You want your ears boxed? I was raised in a camp, but I insist on respect, remember that. Even from you. - I'll always respect you. - Don't be vulgar. With your trade... What trade? Fake gypsy- The destiny you foretold will be mine, anyway. Which of us lied? Which one cheated? Which one seduced? Your troubles aren't my fault. Even if we hadn't met on the road, you would've enlisted. You didn't want to marry. So you took advantage of us. Now look at me. I'll speak to Fier à Bras. He does what I ask. I don't need your help. I'll deal with him myself. I'll get out without his permission. I'll cut off his ears. Don't do that. Are you afraid to lose him? There's nothing between us. Why so hostile? Did I tell on you in the wagon when you broke loose? I slapped you and I'd do it again. But I was kind afterwards. I gave you food and wine. I stole tobacco from my father for you. So, you're guarding the prisoner. Good for you. You must keep an eye on the rogue. I'll make sure he's branded and slaving in the galleys. I'd be careful if I were you. - Why'? - I'd forgive him. - What for? - He's a terror, a true desperado. It'll be his life or yours. He'll want to avenge himself. Avenge himself? Hell's bells and buckets of blood! Do you hear me, mongrel? You, louse. But... He's gone! Gone? The door's locked. Where did he go? He can't be far. Guard! Guard! Sound the alert. Trumpets! Trumpets! Guard! Captain. Guard! Trumpets! Close all doors. Check all exits! The prisoner has escaped! You should come down. Nice view. Now there's a pretty valley between two peaks. Do you hear me? Is the fishing good there? You're really too stupid. How nice of you! Bringing me wine! Give me your sword. My sword? What for? A soldier without a sword is a rose without thorns. What is he doing? ls that what all the fuss is about? Captain, I locked him up, then presto he was gone. But where? What's worse, I had locked the door. But there, he's gone. Have you lost something? What are you doing there? Me? I was waiting for you. Do come up. Come up so I can tickle your spleen. "So I can tickle your spleen“? How well put. So I can tickle your spleen! A ladder! You asked for it. I'm anxious to see him in action, I've heard so much. Aren't you? Stop them or they'll kill each other. At that age, death comes easy. What's going on? What a hullabaloo. - I was doing the wash. - Be quiet, look. - You couldn't fight like that. - Listen, I lent him my sword. Keep off those powder-kegs. I hope he kills Fier à Bras. What a thing to say! Be quiet. They're beginning. Cuckoo! Are you all right? Be careful. Fire! It's going to blow up. Put out the fire. Where's Fanfan? He's here. I'll never forget what you did for me. We're one big family now. You'll be my brother and I, your father. Meanwhile, catch, Papa. Come, son. Have you seen my pipe? No. Where is Captain de la Houlette? What about him? I'm here. Where else would I be? What a stupid question. How can I help? Letter from Marshal d'Estrées. What good news do you bring? This smells of powder. We'll break camp tonight. We'll take up position near Vertelune. It seems the hostilities are at last about to resume. My swashbucklers, bless your good fortune. You came close to spending the night in the cell. War has spared you the humiliation. Long live war! Sound the assembly. No, not this way. As the regiment of Aquitaine struck camp, at Vertelune the King held a Council of War, with Marshal d'Estrées, and some other great commanders of the day. There were also some ladies, Madame de Pompadour. Her Highness Princess Henriette. What's that impertinent bugler interrupting us for? It's the regiment of Aquitaine. It followed us to camp nearby. Fortunes of war, fortunes of love. Fanfan, do not accuse us of complicity with destiny. We had no wish to tempt you, but look... This is her window and behind it... The King's daughter. Forget her. Let's get a drink. - Everywhere I go... - What? If I listened... Don't, you'll end up believing. Providence... We'll talk at the ale-house. A drink is a great consoler. Adeline told the truth unintentionally. A woman tells the truth to hide a lie. Stop staring at that window. It's drinking time. The village is full of Henriettes just raring to dance. Come on. One, two, three, four, five... Friendly. One, two, three, four, five... Valiant. Attractive and a feared swashbuckler. - Friendly and valiant? - Yes. Pick another card. And another one. Clubs. A warm heart. Indomitable courage. You'll win what he has refused others. You'll share a great fortune as a married couple. Married? And he's attractive? A great lover, expert in the art of caresses. Elegant, a pleasing manner, the most adorable and fetching moustache. - Moustache? Are you sure? - Positive. That's not quite how I imagined him. He'll shave, or maybe it hasn't grown yet. Either way, love is in these three cards. I'm so happy, father. You can't know how happy I am. Poor Fier à Bras. Did you hear? Even if I wanted to, fate would not make me your wife. Your daughter is no physiognomist. - Five pistoles. - Here. So, did I do it right? Yes, but why didn't she recognize my description? She dreams of another, but who? Warm heart, indomitable courage, a great lover. My description exactly. To your love life, Fanfan. To Princess Henriette. Again? You're daydreaming, Fanfan. Drink up and shut up. Why are you staring at me? Are you really going to grow a moustache? - I've thought about it, why? - He has! Tranche-Montagne, I love you. She was right. - Who? - I consulted a fortune-teller. You consulted a rival? She's a real one. - And you believed her? - I believe in cards, horoscopes, stars, palmistry, God, the Blessed Virgin, and in love. - I do too. - She said a gallant will love me. Great adventures await me. Win what he refuses others. A military career. As a married couple we'd have much fortune. I'll find glory. My secret desires. The Princess' love. You believed her? She was joking. Princess Henriette is mine, such is my destiny. Well then, go to her. Go to her! Why do you hesitate? What do you fear? Your lucky star will protect you. Is your warm heart afraid and indomitable courage fading? Are you challenging me? Tonight I'll have her hand. Tonight. Henriette. Her hand. God, have mercy on him. Who's there? Guards! Through the window! Surround the castle and take them, dead or alive. - Good Lord! - It's beautiful. How do I address the King's daughter? First you do... - Then... - Like this? With 45,000 men, superiority is vital. Our army is smaller than the enemy's. The smaller the force, the easier it is to deploy unnoticed. If Your Majesty concurs, I've decided on the battle here. Here, marshal? Here, Your Majesty. What has the enemy decided? The enemy has consented. Where will your right flank be? On the left. On the left. A charming notion. And the left flank on the right. No, Sire, at the centre. - And the centre on the right. - As it should be. An astute disposition. Disorientation of the enemy. We're expecting an estimated 10,000 deaths. The cost would be higher with Marshal de Saxe. Am I in the habit of haggling for victory, marshal? Two men, probably spies, have just entered the castle. Find them. Capture them. Hang them and leave me be. What are you doing? Where have you come from? You won't believe me. I fell down the chimney. Take him away. Look! Your Highness, a man is in here. Don't touch me. Do you recognize me? The highway, the brigands, the tulip? Fanfan? She recognized me. I knew it! Our love is pre-ordained. Quick, Henriette, love me, as fate wills it. No moustache, see? Do you like me better? - Why'? - What do you mean? At the request of His Majesty Louis XV, the court martial of the army in the field has sentenced to death Fanfan La Tulipe and Tranche-Montagne for desertion, treason, lèse-majesté, trespassing and disturbing the peace. Consequently, they will be hanged tomorrow morning before their regiment. The ceremony will be followed by a ball, which will end with fireworks. The first dance is mine. What's wrong with her? Bad news? She was fond of Tranche-Montagne. Poor Tranche-Montagne. Cheer up, we'll miss him. Besides, hanging isn't such a bad death. But he was different from other men, he hated death. The King's not being fair. Sergeant-major. - What? - Will Papa be hung tomorrow? Forgive us, Your Majesty, but there's a pressing matter of concern to this young beauty. An affair of state, I warrant. No, an affair of the heart. That is much more serious. What do you want of me? - A tiny favour. - That bodes ill. A favour. The favour of pardon... for Fanfan La Tulipe. Such earnestness. He once risked his life to rescue Henriette and me. Now it's our turn to save him. Save him, Sire. Promise me. Arise, my child. Arise. Do not waste your tears on a wretch who doesn't love you. He is obsessed with the idea of becoming my son-in-law. My son-in-law! It's my fault. I made him act that way. With a false prediction. I dared him to win Madame Henriette. How old are you, my child? Twenty-two. No predictions for you? I shall marry Fanfan La Tulipe. Marvellous. Why those tears then? Let fate and justice take their course. I've decided he'll be hung. But moved by your beauty, I shall grant you the favour... of bidding him farewell. I don't want to say goodbye. I love you. I'll always love you. Always. You must say goodbye nicely. Promise you'll forget me. I'll never forget you. I'll always love you. But, Adeline, what have I done to deserve your love? Nothing. Why do you love me? What do I know? I feel happy when I'm near you, when you look at me. Don't cry. I wasn't condemned to see you cry. Smile. Come on, smile. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have misled you. Why did you listen to me? I believed in you. And now, if I had to love someone else, it would be you. Don't leave me. I couldn't go on living without you. You were told you would live happily. Forget me. Fanfan will have had the short life of a rose, of a tulip. May it bring you happiness. My poor Tranche-Montagne. I'm so sad. How happy do you think I am? Life is hard, especially when you have to leave it. Time's up. Have you nothing more to say? - I love you! - Come along. I love you. Don't be sad. I don't love you. You could at least have said you loved her. I wanted to leave a bad impression. I don't want her to miss me. Maybe... I was beginning to love her. It's about time. I acted like... A brute. I wanted to fulfil my destiny. Couldn't you look around you? Adeline is worth more than any king's daughter. I believed in my destiny. I still believe in it. Not for long. Present arms! Attention! Disengage sword! High sword. Show sword. I'm glad to see an execution before I die. My poor wife always said she'd die first. Who can you trust? They're walking, they're alive and an instant later, they're gone. To them, we'll be dead. Life hangs... but by a thread. Let's wait for each other up there. See you soon. Is that where they'll hang Papa? Just wait and see. Mom, I have to pee. Afterwards. Goodbye, Tranche-Montagne. Chin up! I'd like to see you in my shoes. Is it all over? I didn't feel a thing, did you? There you are. If that's death, why all the fuss? Yes, but we're alive and we're going to go on living. Wait till I tell my wife. By order of the King, since the sentence failed to be executed, the prisoners are pardoned. May the will of God be done for His Majesty's pleasure. Long live the King! Long live the King! Had I known, I wouldn't have gotten so upset. Adeline! It's a miracle. It is indeed a miracle the King decided to pardon. That the King should lend himself to this charade is another. Never was a miracle better managed. His Majesty awaits your gratitude. Come. Come and do something with that hair. Get that hair out of your eyes. There. Much better. An air of modesty is exciting. Don't tremble. What do you fear? I'm not afraid, not trembling. The King proved to be an ordinary man. A sensitive man, easy to talk to. He shall listen to you. Make the most of his goodwill as he will of yours. Above all, don't forget he's... your master. Let yourself be guided by his whims. There. You're set. You're right, he's a man like other men. What a graceful curtsey! I see Lebel schools his recruits well. Do it again. Very good. Spare me your thanks. It is enough to see you happy. Your face speaks for you, and I have not eyes enough to listen. Do you love your King, my child? As much as I respect him, Sire. As a royal subject, you would not wish to displease him? I should not dream of it, Sire. So you will be loyally happy to please him? Come here, pure beauty, natural grace, charming object. Come here. Look at me and let's forget who we really are. You wish to please me and pleasure is all I ask. Have a seat, give me your pretty little hand. But my heart belongs to Fanfan. Who asked for your heart? All I ask for is a trifling matter. I'm a good girl. You owe me for my affection. If you love Fanfan, thank me. My whims enable you to offer proof of your love, by betraying in his service the loyalty you have sworn him. The few moments of pleasure we'll share will buy him his pardon. After which, if your conduct has satisfied me, I shall reward you, and he will owe you his fortune. But so many other girls want to take advantage of their beauty. I find your resistance more stimulating. I order you to love me unreservedly. No, please, don't touch me. What are you waiting for? Run after her. What happened with the King? Nothing. The King wanted... - And you didn't. So? - I slapped him. - You didn't! - I did. - But if Monsieur Lebel finds me... - He won't. You slapped the King? I dream of it. My compliments, Lebel. I ran and ran, but she's gone. Vanished. Spare me your explanations. I want that girl, do you hear? Find out where she is, but do it discreetly. Kidnap her and bring her to me, discreetly. You have 48 hours. If I can't even rely on your knavery... My friend, all I can say is long live life! And I'm being modest. I've seen death from up close and she's not worth knowing. She's got a real death's-head! Cheers, my widow! Don't drink so much. You're out of control. If you don't like it, you can always weep on my grave. Here's to you, Fanfan. Don't you see Adeline in my glass? Adeline, she's smiling at me. She's telling me to drink her. I didn't expect to find you there. Come on out now. She's disappeared. Adeline! We've been looking for you all day! Come back to Papa! - You tell her. - Come back... - Strange she's disappeared like that. - Indeed. Let me tell you something. She's fled the resurrection. She thinks you're dead. You don't tell a girl you don't love her before dying. How can you not mind not being loved? Monsieur Fanfan La Tulipe? That's us, loosely. It's me, specifically. I've come for my mistress. Madame de Pompadour. Madame de... Pompadour? I'm to tell you Adeline is safely hidden at the convent of Mortelame. Safely hidden? Why? Is she in danger? The greatest. She slapped the King. The King? - Of France? - Of France. She saw the King? Yes, to thank him for the gift he gave her of your lives. How is it possible? She dared to speak to the King about us. She slapped the King? But why did she do that? That's my kind of woman. The King's disrespectful and... You said she's at Mortelame? She will be tonight. Fetch Lebel. My mistress urges you to be wary of Monsieur Lebel. Monsieur Lebel? The chamberlain? He swore to find Adeline and bring her to the King. He may be after you. Take care, Fanfan La Tulipe. If you see her, tell her to cheer up and that I love her. Tranche-Montagne, I'm loved by a woman worthy to be queen. La Franchise! My dear La Franchise. Hug me. We've found her. Stop worrying, Adeline is at the convent of Mortelame. She slapped the King. She's hiding at Mortelame. I'll marry her, we love each other. The coincidence is too great. But watch out for Lebel. And mum's the word. Hug your son-in-law, Papa. You too, Fier à Bras. Don't forget, mum's the word. Which of you is Sergeant La Franchise? He is, sir. My name's Lebel, the King's chamberlain. The King has entrusted me with a mission you should keep secret. - You have a daughter? - Yes, sir. Where is she at this hour? Lucky he who knows. I haven't seen her all day. She'll show up soon? I hope so. You're a sergeant. Would you like to be an officer? - An officer! - An officer? Would you like your daughter to be the wife of a captain or colonel? With a royal dowry and the King as godfather to her children? You can make this dream come true. Just inform me of Adeline's return. One word, sir. No reason. I couldn't be that captain or colonel? Why not? I'll be as good a husband. Why not? But first, the King must tire of the charms of the young person in question. I'm in no hurry. With my future assured, I can wait. She's at the convent of Mortelame. Why didn't you say so? At first I doubted your identity, but your words inspire confidence. I'm happy to be of service to His Majesty with honour and dignity. To serve the King is to serve the glory of the kingdom of France. You're only a sergeant? We shall think of you. For you have all the required faults to obtain the vilest of honours. If I understand correctly, the King is not immune to Adeline's charms. I knew there was something about her. If you become colonel, I shall be your general. Why not a field marshal? - Monsieur Lebel. - Yes? May I draw your attention to the soldier Fanfan La Tulipe? If we are to succeed, he should be taken care of. Adeline will never submit to the King as long as she loves Fanfan. She'll love him unto death. Thus“. I like you. You have a noble spirit, you should be in my service. Be at the Cornette Inn at dawn to take command of a few stout men. We shall seize Adeline in her refuge. As for Fanfan, we shall deal with him... in our best interest. Feeling better? How's life? My head feels as if a chicken were hatching in it. - We drank too much last night. - We did. Good morning, father-in-law! - Why so glum? - I'm a bastard. - Why'? - I'm a swine. Judas would spit on me. Monsieur Lebel came last night. Now he knows where Adeline is. - You told him? - Not I, Fier à Bras. But I didn't stop him. Now they're on their way to kidnap Adeline. - What are you saying? - Simple, I make myself sick. - When did they leave? - Three pipes ago. One more thing. They've also decided to kill you. You're not forgetting anything? There's nothing else? No, that's it for now. - I'd like to be five days older. - Why'? I'll be dead by then, that's when we attack the enemy. No one will be sorry, not even me. But why? Tranche-Montagne, come! Help me, sister. I've been wounded by bandits. Come in, my child. This way. Careful! The brutes! Get back. Hold on! It's up to the two of us now, the four of us. Through here! Help! Take that, Fier à Bras! Where did he go? This way. I'm coming, Fanfan. Help, La Franchise! I've got you now, Fanfan. No more tulips. There'll be tulips on your grave. Let go of me! They've taken Adeline! Follow me. But is this not a flag? It belongs to the astonished, disconcerted enemy. In the excitement of pursuing the carriage, both parties had ventured behind enemy lines. The enemy thought, "Is this a manoeuvre?" "The enemy has deceived us!" Couriers were instantly dispatched to Marshal Brandeburg's HQ. A noted strategist, this Marshal Brandeburg. He was given a coherent report by the couriers. Aware of the situation, he took matters in hand. With the genius of improvisation, he ordered an attack from a surprise quarter. Moments later, couriers ran to give out the marshal's orders. Infantry and cavalry about-faced, the artillery swivelled right behind them. He had turned the tables completely. Your Majesty... Louis XV was no less disconcerted by the enemy's behaviour. What was the meaning of this about-face which upset his plans? The somewhat troubled Louis XV tried vainly to understand. He thought: "How very disobliging of them to turn their backs." "Does the enemy fear another enemy?" “Or are they letting us down?“ What are they doing? This manoeuvre escapes me. Meanwhile... Faster, faster! Faster! Adeline, jump! Don't be afraid. So you do love me a little? I never chased a woman so hard. - I adore you. - You said you didn't love me. - You believed me? - Of course not. Tranche-Montagne! Look out, Fanfan. We're out of powder. - Are you wounded? - I don't know. - Where's Adeline? - They got her. - Got her? How? - Watch out! Quick! It looks like... Look, there's a cave. It must lead somewhere. What's the risk? - To find our way. - Let's go. What are they saying? That things have gone wrong, the French are facing the wrong way. So open fire, gentlemen, and close the windows. We must advance in the direction we would normally retreat. I don't know what the French HQ was thinking. No guards, no artillery preparation... Hands up! Close the doors! Let's go. Move it. Everybody in here. Next! If you try to escape, you'll be shot. Good work! They're loaded. Cock them. You go upstairs. Hurry up. No one. Barricade the door! The table. Take the pistols. Fire at will. Bravo, Papa! The enemy realized their HQ had been captured. Terror-stricken, the soldiers fled in all directions. The rout was all the more complete in that Fanfan... A white flag? ls Marshal Brandeburg surrendering? Indeed he is, but to whom? To whom? Yes, to whom? How very strange. I'd like to know who has dared to dispose of our enemy, and rob us of our rightful victory? But look at them, they're surrendering to us. It's a rout. I knew we would win. I knew we would be lucky. Luck has never let me down. We won without firing a single shot. Wonderful. Where are your 10,000 dead? There's always next time. What's this old carriage? Sire... Forgive the extraordinary vehicle, Your Majesty. I don't know where I've been, but it must have been far away. May Your Majesty forgive me, but I've lost Adeline. Better than myself, the perils I have suffered will convince... Your Majesty, that I remain... your very humble and devoted servant, Lebel. Remove the debris, but take care of the horses. Between us, I'd like to know to whom we owe this victory, which history will attribute to us. My compliments, Monsieur La Tulipe. It's true that war is too serious to be left to soldiers. You have nevertheless shown in your operation, on your initiative and without our authority, talents worthy of generals. I name you captain. Your destiny, you say, is to marry your King's daughter. And so you shall. I offer you my daughter's hand. I offer providence a helping hand. To you I offer my adopted daughter, Adeline La Franchise. She's worthy of you, for she has bravely resisted all advances. You, Tranche-Montagne, shall be sergeant-major. You, La Franchise, I name you father-in-law with triple pay. As for us, we wish the three of you joy, happiness and prosperity.
