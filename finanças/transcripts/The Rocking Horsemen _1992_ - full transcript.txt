The Rocking Horsemen Rock. Rock. Rock. Rock. For any age, rock is a symbol of youth. Bvrrrrrrrrooom! This band of old men... ...is The Ventures, playing Pipeline. Of course, they weren't always old men. When they were young... ...that electric glissando down the frets... ...captivated young people the world over. That glissando travelled the length and breath of Japan... ...more than 20 years ago now. Young people today, who don't know The Ventures... ...go reeling through youth to the rock sound they made. The Ventures invented, capitalized and manufactured... ...the electric sound. That tremolo glissando is the sound of legend... ...of youth eternal. Directed by Obayashi Nobuhiko March 28, 1965, early afternoon: I was 15, and this is the dream I had. Puerile, yes, but vivid. Help me! "Dondorahan!"... I was going to yell. Then I woke up. That means "thunder" in the dialect... ...of the small town I'm from in Shikoku. It was spring break, and I was taking life easy. I was starting high school in April. I was practising Hoffman's Boat Song... ...on my brother's old violin... ...but it was making me sleepy. That wasn't the first time I'd heard Pipeline. The Beatles were popular then... ...and I knew some of their songs, too. But pop music was just pop music... ...nothing more than kids' stuff. The true art of music... ...music you can still enjoy when you're 80... ...was classical music. Or so I was thinking as I dozed off. But that glissando... ...took my silly snobbery and blew it clean away. Now what? Electric Liberation! The Gods had given me a sign. I need an electric guitar! Now there was no going back. Now what?! Kanonji, Kagawa Prefecture. A glissando had summoned my heart to rock 'n' roll... ...and now I was in high school. I'm Fujiwara Takeyoshi. "Take" means "bamboo"... ...and "yoshi" means "good". The character "take" can also be read "chiku"... ...so my friends call me... - Good morning! - Hey, Chikkun! ..."Chikkun". The indicative mood... ...is real. The subjunctive mood... ...is a lie. So if you use... ...the subjunctive mood, then you're lying! I'd started to let my hair grow. A rock musician couldn't look like a Buddhist acolyte... ...so in English Grammar, the truth is indicative mood. ...though some people thought I was just being sloppy. Indicative and subjunctive: in the real world, truth and lies! You know, Father... ...Takeyoshi's growing up. I guess it had to come. Why do you say that? He's always looking at his hair in the mirror. He is, is he? When the hair starts to grow... ...no matter where on the body it is, you're interested. But it wasn't only hair... ...that I was looking at. - Who's that? - Just a boy in my class. - Guess he likes music. - I wouldn't know. Sometimes, of course, I looked at other things, too. A friend lent them to me. You like pop music, don't you? Yeah, I love it. Yeah, me too. Yeah? Haw about this? You like this, don't you? Take them! Goda Fujio, the priest's son, was kind enough... ...to concern himself with... ...my total ignorance of sex. Of course, you get bored with dirty magazines... ...and my thoughts would wander to a certain Guyatone guitar. What makes Greek culture special is... ...uh, what should I say, uh... That's good! Really good! Draw me one, too! There. Wow! Fantastic! What are you two up to?! Uchimura Yuriko... my first fan! Someday I want to start a band... like The Ventures. Yeah? Now I had the hair. What I needed was a guitar. If I couldn't buy one, I'd have to make one. - Bye. - Bye, Chikkun. And now it's time to meet Shirai Seiichi. This was a day that can truly be called "historic". Hello! Is this the Light Music Club room? Yes, it is. I was thinking of joining. The second- and third-year guys aren't here yet. Practice starts at 2. Can I watch? You can if you want, but there's not much to see. - Why not? - Well, you'll see. What do you want to play? Rock! Rock? They won't like that. Why not? They don't know anything about rock. Then what do you play? There's five of us. The others are second- and third-years. We're playing Aloha Oe. Yeah? You're singing? No, no vocals. Just the music. We've got double bass, organ... ...two recorders and guitar. What else? Funicoli, Funicola... ...Yankee Doodle, too. All that old stuff? I can't believe it! Third Year High School, too. Without singing?! That's right. I can't believe it! Me neither. Still want to join? What do you play? Guitar. You like that stuff? Hell no! I only came today to quit. You want to play rock? Yeah. Nothing else. Me too. Are you good? Not very. I taught myself. Play something. What? Rock. Your best song. Well? Let's start a band! Yeah! I was going to say that! Yeah? Play something else! - What's the matter? - Toilet! - Thanks! - Take care of yourself! Sorry! That's OK. I always stop here. You eat too much fish? I'd had more before I was six than most people ever do! Are you OK? Not the last few days. That's rough... you're OK? Most people go once a day, I go five or six times. It works out the same. Thanks for carrying this. You want to get on? No, thanks! I live here. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Hi! - I'm back. He helped me out. You should ride to school yourself. Come in. Hi, Brother. Your friend? Come in! Mom, Dad, I'm back! Hot today, isn't it! Shirai Fish... sea bass sashimi for three people? Thank you. Seiichi... I'll bring you up some grilled eel. Thanks, Brother. "Brother" is your sister? By the time I knew better, everyone was used to it. - But "Brother"? - She's like a brother. You don't have to worry about taking over the store. I'll do that. You go to university. That's nice of her. But I don't mind taking over the store. I could still play the guitar. Grilled eel. Thanks. Brother's my pop music mentor. She likes... - ...a nice voice... - Pat Boone. - ...manly... - Belafonte. Good songs. - Patti Page, Dinah Shore... - Anything good. Nat King Cole, especially Lonely One. Makes me want to cry! Nature Boy... I start to shake, and it's like I'm carried far away! Didn't he die in February? He was only 47. What a shame... I'm still not over it. "The Kyoto Chorus"... whose is this? Hm... I don't know. Who would have left that here? - Bye. - You leaving? The eel was great. Well, come back, then, and we'll make some more. - Be right back. - Hello... - The fish packer. - I'm Fujiwara. How are you. He has a fish-processing plant. Nice day, huh? Look out! Look out! He's Brother's boyfriend. What?! You play lead, Shirai, I'll play rhythm. We need more than just two guitars! - I'll get some guys. - You know someone good? - Like the sign said. - What sign? It'll work out. We might find a practice place, too. Yeah? I'll get him whether he wants to or not. - Who? - Leave it to me! Hello. Hungry? Before we go any further... ...let me introduce my family. My father, Takayuki, was the scholarly type. He thought biology at a commercial school... ...but his hobby was writing haiku that no one understood. "The beach, pine branches..." "...the sun in the west stabs through..." "...perhaps a fish jumps..." Now swish it round... one, two, quickly... now eat. At least they're making these chestnut buns right again. Sit up straight. - How's your cold, Mrs. Takase? - Fine, thank you. Good... once, twice... and drink. Mom founded the "Quickly!" School of Home-making. Try to put more of yourself into it. Everyone's face is different you know. Oh...! A cocoon! There's a smile. Flowers smile, too. Quickly, quickly... all right? There! She'd thought Home Economics. My parents met at work and got married... - Here you go. - I'll do it. ...but when my sister was born, she became a housewife. What a pest! She died of pneumonia before her second birthday. Nadeshiko... ...she was so smart... so pretty... It was so sad... I won't have any more! Now don't talk like that. Be patient. Under my Grandmother's gentle urging... ...for good or ill, she had my brother and me. To grow straight, like the bamboo... that's good. I guess they wanted me to grow healthy and strong... Fujiwara Takeyoshi... a good name! I'm named after a cedar... My father didn't have very good taste in names. I hate being named after a tree! Change my name! Why? It's a nice name! It's unique! I want a normal name! I want a normal name! It's tough having avant-garde parents. Anyway, the guy I wanted in the band... ...was the guy who lent me all the girlie magazines... ...Goda Fujio. You were sweating, so I thought I'd cool you off. I want to talk to you. Yeah... I've got some senior stuff. "Senior"? I had to start you slow. Junior, then intermediate. Come on. You've got so much of this filth! You read enough of them. Don't call them "filth"! They're one of life's little treasures. Maybe so... anyway, lend me this one. I came to talk about a band. You're going to start one? Yeah, and I wanted you to be in it. I can play harmonica and xylophone. Is that all right? Uh, no... I thought you might try the bass. - Bass? - Yeah. Electric bass. Electric bass? Cool! Like Paul McCartney. Know anyone who'll lend me one? I thought we'd all get summer jobs... ...and buy new instruments. Can I sing? All you want! The only trouble is... I joined the shogi club. Quit that old man's game! I wouldn't call it an old man's game... ...and if I quit, there won't be anyone left who's any good. Hello, sir. I'm Fujiwara Takayuki's son. Oh...! I haven't seen your parents in a long time. - Are they well? - They're fine, thanks. Oh, that's wonderful. Fujio, could you do the memorial service tonight... ...at the Fukudas'? I'm feeling quite tired. Sure. Would you then? I'll call the Fukudas and tell them. Come on, eh? I don't know... Come on! I don't know... Come on! Make up your mind! Come on! Come back again. Don't keep that too long. You'll get all worked up. Nice to see you out of the hospital... Long life to you! You're even more help to us than your father. Oh, thank you... That's great! You're just like a real priest! Well, I am! If I play bass, what about you? Rhythm guitar and vocals. Vocals, huh? But you can't have a band with two people. I've found a great guy for lead. He's called Shirai Seiichi. He plays great acoustic. On electric, he'll be fantastic! Hello? Are you eating well...? Good! What about drums? - Okashita Takumi. - The octopus? "The octopus"? That was his nickname in Middle School. If you sound... oh, hello! I hear that Mr. GOTO... ...is putting on aluminum windows. Nice to see you! You can pronounce his name to mean... ..."weird octopus", and after some unkind person... ...named him that, he started to look like one! Some things follow you all your life. I guess so. So did he say yes? I asked him, but he turned me down flat. He said he was playing in the school band. - Tomorrow, behind the toilet. - The toilet? You meet a woman at a temple. You meet a man behind the can. See you. The next day Goda Fujio, a friend if ever there was one... ...extracted himself from the Shogi Club. - Wait! - I'm really sorry! Oh, here... I can't take this. Wait! Wait a minute! We can't win without you! I'm sorry! I resign! And then... This place stinks! Don't complain. You piss here, too. Here he is! There he is! Risen from the sea! Pimples and all! Hey! - What? - We want to talk to you. If it's about money... No. I've got lots of money. What, then? Step over here. Okashita, this is your big chance! Chance for what? We want you to join our band... to be the drummer. The drummer? No, no... I'm already playing the drum in the school band. Forget that! You only play one drum. With us you get tom-toms and cymbals. I'm happy just playing the one. Yeah, but if you're in a rock band, you get girls, too. You won't get any in a brass band! No? You just bang the drum in the back row... ...like an idiot! Better to bang on a chunk of wood! You'll get girls! Yeah! Everyone watches the drummer! Dead Center-stage. Bass and guitars off to the sides. You can play drum solos! It's the drummer who counts us in... one, two, three... ...with the sticks. Up there in the lights... you play a roll... It looks great! Really... Pass this up and you'll never get a girl. That's the truth! Never? This is your chance! Take it or die a virgin! Thus Fujio clinched the argument. Still the rainy season! Vacation starts soon. Are we all going to get summer jobs? - Summer jobs? - Well, we need instruments. What can we do? Maybe work in a noodle shop? Who'd eat noodles I made? Yeah... There wasn't much work in 1965 for a high-school student... ...in our small town in Shikoku. It was all noodles. There was no McDonald's to work at. There still isn't. The teachers said... If you're bored... ...then study more... ...idiot! And then it was summer break. I'm not going to work. Don't you need money? No. I'm buying stocks. Stocks? Summer's a busy time for us. I guess it is. When it's hot... oh, thanks... ...the old folks die off like flies. We have to be ready. But I've got a great job for the three of you. One of our parishioners has a farm equipment factory. ¥850 a day, paid in a lump sum when you quit. - You're mafia! - I do have a mistress... Liar! You get noodles and two eggs in the cafeteria for ¥55. Don't tire yourself out with overtime. But sometimes even the best- laid plans don't work out. If you've nothing better to do, help here! I was thinking of starting a job tomorrow. What? Ah, Giant Baba! He looks like a decent guy. - I want to work! - Only fools watch wrestling! Why work? Do you need something? - Yeah. A guitar. - You've got a violin! I need a guitar! Why? For some music I like. You could play it on the violin if you'd practise. Look, it has to be played on the guitar! Some friends and I got jobs at the Inada Factory. Without asking us first? Did your teachers say it was all right? Yeah. I got permission. I lied. OK? Can I? Can I? Huh? You don't have to work. I'll buy you a guitar and an amp and whatever you need. The other guys wouldn't like it if I had it all given to me. I'll work. If you like. Toilet. If you help every day in the shop... ...and do all the deliveries, we'll pay you ¥500 a day. But you'll have to work hard, all right? Grandma! Don't drink cold tea! This is fine! You'll give your stomach a chill! I will work! Definitely! Fritz Von Erich's Death Claw! Giant Baba's size 15 feet! The Destroyer's leg-lock! I'll buy a Guyatone guitar! - I guess you can. - Really?! But I don't want... I'll fix this tonight. ...you becoming a delinquent. I won't! He might anyway! You've still got to study! I'll take it away if your marks go down! They won't! I can make you a lunch if you want. We get food there. - How long does this last? - All summer! You do the stupidest things! Father! Get to work! - Hey, you're on time! - Best we arrive together. Yeah. Let's go. Hey! Let's go! Let's go! Careful! Careful! That's good! What are you doing?! Come on! Work! Just that? At your age is that enough? I'm fine. There's a lot of it. Don't wear yourselves out too fast. You're here all summer. But don't slack, either. We call him "the overtime king". He lives for work. Listen to you! If you'd try working hard for once... It's a problem for all of us. For a man to reach high school without having a woman... ...is a disgrace! We'll have to take you guys out somewhere. Zentsuji's close, but the girls there aren't much fun. Ito here goes clear across the island... ...all the way to Kochi to get laid! Lancelot with a rented princess! - Ignore him. - What's "Lancelot"? - What's that?! - Quitting time. Sir Lancelot is leaving to cross the mountains! Bye. Who's that?! Megumi, from school. She lives near here? I guess so. Otherwise why would she be here? - What does she want? - Maybe she wants to see you! I doubt it! Bye! Look! She's standing closer than she was yesterday! Easy job, easy job... Well done! Good work, guys! Bye! Friend of yours? Hey, honey... ...I'm here every day, and you just look right through me. I don't like that. Goodbye. Too young... She shows up every day... what a pest! It figures. She's in love. You know her? Sure. I told her to do that. You did, did you... It was my job. She belongs to our temple, and she came to me for advice. - You didn't talk to me... - Why would I? Sure, why would you! Hi! I hear you and the drapers' son are going to... ...tie the knot. Hurry and have kids, eh? Become a mother, then a grandmother... Mind your own business! It's Shirai she likes, not you. What?! She says she's been crazy about you for a long time. Come on, handsome... give us a smile. You've got a big head! Shut up! You like her? Not specially... she's not in my class. But you wouldn't want her to kill herself over you. Kill herself?! If she does, it's your fault. Chikkun! Shirai! What's the matter? You're white as a ghost! She was there! Who? Where? Hikichi Megumi? At the store? Bad karma, maybe. Bad karma? What do you mean?! See a movie? No! Not another one of those sex-and-horror things! Even the posters make me sick! There's a different one today. Clark Gable's in it. He's OK, but he's still kind of oily. I like Gregory Peck. Him and that Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday! I prefer Jane Mansfield. That's cold! Why do I talk to you? Can I help you? That's a weird girl... She's here! You know her? Like that girl in the song who burned down temples for love. You lit the fire... you put it out! That's spontaneous combustion. When a girl like that is in love, she does what she wants. You mean I'm stuck? It's fate. That's easy for you to say! Aw, but she's so cute, isn't she, Chikkun. He'll have to die with her! Then we'll never start our rock band. OK... I'll speak to Megumi. What'll you say? When a priest speaks, people listen. Good afternoon... Or else I can protect him by writing a sutra on his body. Yeah. All over it. I'm not writing on his dick! Then I'll lose it! It's your fingers the band needs. She's not here! She's stopped coming, hasn't she. I'm going to make a great priest. You are. What did you say to her? She was very hard to convince. I had to use Plan B. "Plan B"? I'll find a way to make him love me! Well, don't tell anyone... Shirai has a man's body, but in his heart he's a woman. He can only love men. You're a woman... look at him! He's pale, he's delicate... He's all soft and bulgy around the nipples. And Fujiwara's a bigger homo! Some old weird guy did things to him when he was a kid. After that the poor guy just wasn't able to become a man. I heard there was something with him and his father, too. His brother, too! Homosexual incest! The poor bastard! That's horrible! Horrible! They're homosexuals! And right now, Shirai and Fujiwara are... Horrible! Horrible! ...just like that! You talked about us like that?! It isn't all bad for you. If girls don't like you... ...all through school, you can just blame it on those rumors. As Lord Buddha says... "Think on the ways of the world." Megumi, transferring her longing from Shirai... ...had love affairs, attempted suicide, and became... ...the talk of the town. Shut up and come on! Never! Adieu, Mon amour! Now, 20 years on... ...she is the mother of three boys... ...and is known in Kanonji as "The Queen of the Night". Look! They are together! Who? Chikkun and Shirai! They're homosexuals! Oh, that's a lie! Hikichi Megumi says they are. Megumi? That slut? I don't like her. Too many hormones, maybe. You can't believe anything she says. Over here, Mom? Straight ahead. He's working hard! The son of a family that makes food wears a hat! They've worked all summer to save the money. Why don't you give them a discount, Dad? Be quiet, Kazuko! Every time you dust those thing you complain... ...about how nobody wants them. Now we've finally sold them! Don't say that! I feel bad about the amp. That's OK. Brother bought it. We can both use it. Use mine, too. Thank our temple supporters. At least we've all got instruments. That's great. We'll deliver the drums tomorrow, all right? Tomorrow? I'm a little busy today. You can enjoy the anticipation longer. I want to sleep with you... ...but I might roll over like a mother pig and squash you. And I wouldn't want you getting polluted... ...with impure thoughts. Hey, here they are! Great! I'll pass them down. This way! Takumi's drums are here! Here come the drums! Is it really all right for me to hit these things? Why not? I feel like it wouldn't be right. If your heart's in it, how would it be wrong? I guess so. If I put my heart into it. Go ahead. Hit 'em! Perhaps once again Takumi was... ...a child visiting the temple with Grandma. Like that? Perfect! That'll sound great through an amp. That's the sound right there! You're getting better! We should have a practice soon. How come the right side of your head is so bald? I was hit by lightning. I was clinically dead. I saw one of the Saints. He said, "What are you doing here, kid? Go home!"... ...so I was saved. I knew then that he wanted me... ...to walk in the Buddha's path. That was pretty young. I'm going. Put your hand there. You can still feel the electricity. I've cured old ladies of incontinence. All I feel is stubble. I want to hear us with amps! Yeah... bvrrrrrrrrrrooom! Gentlemen: at last we are ready to rehearse as a band. I offer my congratulations. We must, however, first decide on a name for our band. I ask for your candid opinions. If I may speak first... ...how about "Harry and The Typhooons"? "Harry" would, of course, be myself... ...but it's a good name. "Harry and The Typhoons"... See you later. All right. Don't be late. I'm going! Right. Bye! Hurry up! Don't drop it! I know! It's OK! Careful... ...please! I know! Where's the damn octopus?! Asleep, maybe? But this is our first practice! Stop! Stop! You'll break the drum! I'll get a cart and bring them, I told you! That'll take till tomorrow! Jerk! Don't worry! I'll handle them like a pregnant woman! Take those things somewhere else! Good gracious me! We'll have to use my room. Sorry. No problem. Anywhere, so long as the four of us can play. - Is this OK here? - This is heavy! - Hang on... - Grab that... Wait a second... Wait... - It's falling! - Wait, wait... OK? Right! Well, gentlemen, if I might say a few... Quick! ...a few words before we rehearse... gentlemen... ...at last we are ready to rehearse... Just le me get some juice. I offer my congratulations. As I was saying... Supplies! - Listen! - I am! Help yourselves. Anyway, we should think of a name for our band. Right! I ask for your candid opinions. Octo... er, Takumi... Any ideas? For a name? That's what he said. How about "Blue Lions"? What? Guess not, huh? Anything else? How about "Running Cats"? Meow! Why "running"? Like a "running catch" in baseball. Then what's your idea? - Me? - Yeah. I've got a great name. What? "Buds". B U D S... flowers. We're a budding band... ...and it's part of "Buddhism", too. It's cute and classy at the same time. It'd sound neat with two D's, too. Nope. How about "Precious Priests"? What? People we're grateful to have. "Valuable clergy". Of course, "precious" usually means things... ...not people, but... - You hate it? - No one said that. The initials sound good, too... "PR". There's a ring to it. Forget it! Just 'cause you're a priest! Then how about... ...Pimple-Faced Octopus Band? We've got the octopus... ...and he's got the pimples. He got mad. Sure I did! Say that again and I quit! Come on! Be serious! Don't get so mad. You do have pimples. How about this... "Rocking Horsemen"? Like old men on horseback? I was thinking more along the lines of... ...cavalrymen. And with "rocking" it's like "cavalrymen playing rock". And a "rocking horse" is the wooden horse kids ride on. It sounds kind of cool... ...but there's charm to it, too. What do you think? "Rocking Horsemen"... Yeah! That might be good! Let's be "Rocking Horsemen"! That's a great name! It's settled! Let's play! And so we made ready to begin. The sound of electric guitars rang through Kanonji... ...for the first time since history began. "The Bamboo Hat of Itako" Hashi Yukio in Concert Those bloody kids! All right, you lot! That's enough! Can you guys play the song from Space Boy Soran? Sorry. Thunder! What are they doing? Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, Fujiwara... I'd like to talk to you. What's the matter? Terauchi wants me. What'd you do? Nothing. Maybe because of the noise. Maybe the Rocking Horsemen will have to disband. How's the rock band going? You can have this, if you're interested in English songs. I can have this? If you're going to play them. I got it during the Occupation. I can't read music... ...and I like Japanese songs more now. I never thought you would like this. I used to think everything foreign was better, too. And now? Now I prefer Nagasaki Woman to You Are My Sunshine. You can sing that song?! Yeah, I'm pretty good. "Oh, Nagasaki... Nagasaki..." You can go. Hey...! I'm Taniguchi Shizuo, from Class 1. Fujiwara. Class 6. I know. Can I come over sometime? To my place? How about today? Sure. I'm not very good yet. Sing something. - What's this, an audition? - How about Long Tall Sally? The falsetto's hard, and I couldn't sing it here, anyway. - Don't you use an amp? - Don't have one. I plug into Shirai's amp. He's the lead guitar. - Know him? - Yeah. You should buy one. - I'd have to work to do that. - I could make you one. Can you do that? I think I could if I tried. Come over to my place next time. Come over tomorrow. I know the way out. Stay here. That's my house. Hello. Sit here. Make yourself at home. This is my sister Etsuko. She made these cookies. Here's more comfortable. This is fine. No, sit there. Here. That's a "stereo". Sounds different, doesn't it. It's great. He was one of these guys who had so much of everything... ...you wanted to pinch him. I didn't really do that. It was just a figure of speech. See you, then. Come again. Tomorrow. This is for you. For me? - Here. - What is it? The amp I made. - You made this, Taniguchi? - Call me "Shii-San". This is the On switch. Here's Volume. This is the tone control. And here's the good part... reverb! It'll sound great. It's great you can make this yourself. Some day I want to be an engineer. An electric guitar with no amp looks stupid. Thank you. You happy? I'm happy. OK, smile. See you, then. Come again. How could I respond to the friendship Shii-San had shown? If I'd lived in the old days... I am in truth most humbly grateful! 'Twas nothing. ...I'm sure I would have found the words. The Revolution! Late that year we went on a camping trip to rehearse. We went to the Iya Valley in the mountains near Tokushima. "The Euro-American Modern Music Research Group"... I see. Here's your tickets. Don't lose them. It's leaving! Hungry? It says, "Good luck in rehearsal, Rocking Horsemen"! Etsuko. My younger sister. Let's eat! - My bass! - My guitar... How nice if Etsuko had come... ...I thought. There's the river! Here's the gear. Brother and her fish packer had brought the instruments. They're not here. Yeah. Where are they? Where's my guitar? Hey! The tent's so old it's falling apart! It smells funny... That's the smell of mouse shit. Hey, I had to talk nice to the Mountain Club to get this! Thanks a lot! Take care! What? Well, well, well... so that's how it is... It was Shii-San who set it up so we could... ...rehearse outdoors. Here goes! Thunder...! Grandpa! Thunder! It is thunder! This way you don't need a place to plug in. We can play anywhere? Do Long Tall Sally! Sure! Come on! Just dump it all in! The rice is done! Come on, more, more... pour it in! My eyes hurt from the onions! Bring me some water. Oh, did we eat! Oh, for the stomach I had in those days! Shikoku beef! All right! There's soup here for a hundred! Shirai, you should sing too, you know. - I'm tone-deaf when I sing. - I'll sing! You can't sing! I will. I've chanted sutras since I was small. Then sing. "Ayeem so gurado oh zat..." "...sheezu mai ritoru gyaru..." You sound like a middle-school kid! You won't stay in time if you sing... ...all those last syllables. That's weird... how should I do it? I'll show you. "Ah so gura za sheema riroo gaa..." Do it that way. "Ah so gura za sheema riroo gaa..." I'll write it out for you. Normally I wouldn't use such a cheap short-cut... Then we played a song we'd practised hard for that day. That's great! Long Tall Sally! This camp's great! Really! Thanks to Shii-San! Let's make him an honorary member. Great idea! You guys are great! Ow...! That hurt! This place is famous for... THE MIDNIGHT CREEP! Ow! Stop! Stop it! What a bunch of idiots! Tickling was all there was to do now. A pledge that you"ll behave or you can't go. I'll lock you in the shed. We'd all signed an oath to come out here. So that night when we slept... ...we were the best-behaved kids in the world. In the spring of 1966... ...I started my second year of high school. Goodbye, sir. It's great for the brass band, being able to practise here. Yeah, you guys are having trouble with that, aren't you. Yes, sir. It's a lot harder finding somewhere than we thought. Why not become a club? We'd need a staff advisor. I'll do that. Really?! You can be the "Second Light Music Section". They aren't doing very much, so you'll probably be... ...Section One before long. I'll get you your permission. You can use half of the choir room. Sorry, but that's the best we can do. Uh... sir... Yeah? I feel like a teacher's pet. I'll help any student who really wants to do something. Come on. "Second Light Music Section" - How's this? - Great! In English you say "kiss". In German, "Kuß". From which we infer that when in English you "kiss"... ...you have to smile. But to "kuß" you have to pout. In French it's Baisser. Saying it makes you spit, so it sounds dirty. The Italian is bacio, which is cheerful and energetic. Spanish: beso. Indonesian: kecap. "Kiss". I want to. Soon! My first kiss... I dream about it with dozens of girls. I'm sure high-school girls feel the same... ...though I'm not one... ...so I don't know. Now for one of us came one of the great events of a life. Okashita... Shut up! ...kissed someone last night. - Who?! - Ishikawa Emiko! Behind the can? - By my house. - What's the story? Last night was the Hachiman Festival... - A date? - No. - Then what? - I took a walk. Just a walk? When there's a festival around our place... ...the whole neighborhood is up for it. And you were "up", too. Shii-San, where were you? Me and Etsuko were watching in front of the house. And then... ...they were pushed together. Didn't he step back? Well, his ass jerked back, but the rest of him didn't. It wasn't so crowded then, either. That's 'cause he's clumsy. Then, like he'd planned it, instead of going back... ...he stuck his face forward. Passionately? No, they just came close, touched, and pushed together. Maybe it was more passionate by the end... And you just stood and watched?! A true scientist! They were right there! I can't accept it, though. It was an accident, not a kiss. Like two octopuses colliding. A calamity she'll forget as quick as she can. A kiss is still a kiss. No. It lacks the metaphysical element. - That's hard to say... - Then what? His face went red, and he frowned. - He did? - Yeah! But what did she do? Well, her eyes widened, then she walked away. There she goes again. Washroom? I just saw her coming out of there. What's she doing in there? Washing her face and putting creosol on her lips. You sure know a lot! When this happens, girls are in the the can all the time. The poor kid... getting mixed up in something like this! Poor Emiko! Takeyoshi! Telephone! Who is it? Someone talking about "our Takumi". Our Takumi, you know... ...he won't eat! All he's had is two bowls of rice! I just know there's something wrong with him! "Love"? Today he called me out behind the can. Uh... ...well... ...actually... It took him about 15 minutes. But all he did was bump into her. The elements seem to have gone metaphysical. Don't tell anyone. ...he said, but I can't keep this secret. "Secret love" is something for adults... ...and he ain't one. Pure love... "The eternal woman who leads us..." "...to the heights." Like Goethe said. So you really like her? So what do you want to do? Take her somewhere on a date? You could go to the beach if it was summer. It's a bit cold for that now. How about going up on Mt. Kotohiki? There's a weird old pine tree near there you could go see. Old ladies love it! But first they've got to get closer... ...before they start going places together. Why not invite her to a rehearsal? Yeah! She said no. She doesn't like rock. - What does she like? - Mita Akira. Mita Akira? Okashita can't compete in looks. We can't let that stop us. We've got to get her here and let her see what he's like. We'll learn Mita Akira songs. Beautiful Teen Years and Kiss Kiss Kiss. Just get her here. Kiss Kiss Kiss is Hashi Yukio. But I like him better. Anyway, songs like that. Say what you have to... ...but bring her along, OK? - OK. - Let's go. Bye. "I gave you a wild rose" "A rose so wild and white" "With your eyes you smiled at me" "Eyes so clear and bright" "In our hearts until we die" "In the hearts of you and I" "Keep each dream as it appears" "Take each dream and hold it near" "Beautiful teen-age years" "Oh, oh, our teen-age years" "Flowers of joy so bright" "Come to life when you hold them tight" "Thank you for your invitation." "My parents get angry unless I go straight home from school..." "...so I can't come to see you practise." "I'm sorry. Ishikawa Emiko." I wasn't bad-looking when I was young. You're lucky you take after Grandma and me. We won't say who he took after. Like a man, Takumi resigned himself. The songs we'd learned for Emiko... ...became songs to encourage Takumi. We took a perverse pleasure in playing them. I think Takumi had made clear enough his feelings for Emiko. Now she's Mrs. Kuwano, the mother of two children. For Takumi, a sweet memory. A happy ending, I guess. At the very least, it's the classic story of young love: Physical, painful, pure... and in vain. Hello! Takeyoshi... A gift. This is great! You got stuff for everyone? The same sticks as Ringo Starr uses. The guys'll love these! Thanks a lot! Tell me, what are you studying now? Group theory... can I try it? Your fingers are all callused. Hm? How does that go... When did you learn to play? When I was about your age. Mom and Dad didn't know about it. There's someone to see you. Who? That quiet kid from the fish store. Oh, Shirai... What's up? Why don't you come in? The Rocking Horsemen might have their first gig. What?! Brother's boyfriend has a friend... ...who's opening a bar this Christmas. She's trying to get him to use us. Really? At last! Yeah! Playing in front of people! - Who's that playing? - Brother. My brother. That Christmas, the Rocking Horsemen made their debut. "The Rocking Horsemen"... neat! Your debut on Christmas Day! It's here! Here's the PA! Father, you're late! Can I put this here? Plug me in. - Do I have to make a speech? - Who else is there? Where's our Takumi? Hello, "Rocking Horseman"... "Rocking Horsemen". ...just jump right into it! Hurray! Hurray! I am delighted that so many of you have taken time... ...from your busy schedules at this time of year... ...to gather with us here this evening. When I look back... Don't look back! When I look back to when I left high school... Hurray! Hurray! Hurray for Mr. Nishimura! Let's start. Hurray for West Village! Hurray for Christmas! Welcome! They're all at the back. Look, Grandma! Our Takumi! The beginning was great! But the real rock fans must have been somewhere else. What is that?! What a noise! Get in time! When do they stop? They'll play some Japanese songs... Nothing but that jazz! It's so loud! I don't remember how the time went by... We're going. Enough! My ears hurt! My ears hurt! Perhaps more to the back? Everyone's going. Oh, Takumi...! Enough! Stop! Listen! That's enough. I'm going. We're on our way. Bye. Takumi! We're going! That was very good! I'm going. OK. I'll come get the vocal amp tomorrow. Oh, this is mine... Hey! What a shame! I can't pay you. The fish packer said he'd buy you... ...a sandwich or something. However... ...I'll give you these. If I'd been an American girl... Oh, Yo-San! ...that's what I'd've done. Want to go fishing? Who with? With me. What for? To catch fish! Bye! Lock the door. We didn't catch a single fish... ...but I've never enjoyed fishing more. Eight years after that, my father died. My mother has a few more white hairs now... ...but she still does everything quickly. One, two! One, two! One, two! For 27 years they lived together. His last haiku was a perfect example of the avant-garde. "Forward or behind..." "A plastic pail on the sand... Does it see or not?" My life was before me. By my last year of high school the world had changed. The younger kids listened to Japanese "Group Sound" bands. High-school students with Fender Twin amps! Made in America! Yeah, his dad's a doctor. To make it in music, be a doctor's son! The generation gap. Leaving already? Feeling ourselves unwanted again... ...we set up camp nearby. Food was the old camp stand-by, curried rice. Me, too! Just a minute... By ourselves we probably ate all of one of the local cows. Then, on August 30, 1967... ...something happened that I will remember all my life. Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Ouch! What? There's someone here. Who? It's Tomoto Yukiyo... what does she want? What is it? I'm going swimming. Alone? No, with you. With me? Yes. Hurry and let's go. Hang on... Now what?! I was flustered. Should I invite her in to change... ...so we could go in our swimsuits? No, no... better not do that... Dum Du-dum dum dum... You're like a chicken with its head cut off! Going swimming. Oh? Who is that? A friend from school. We won't be too late. Bye! What about lunch? We'll get some noodles there! They don't sell noodles there. Be careful! My first date... wow! What? Nothing... a cicada... maybe. The tide's gone out. It's so nice and quiet. They're tearing down the change rooms. It doesn't matter. You change, too. Going in? You men will remember... You're a good swimmer! No... I was just about to drown. You swim too well to drown. Don't you swim? Yeah, but I came to sun-bathe. If you've come all the way here, you might as well go in. You teach me how. You hold my hands, and I'll kick my feet. Jellyfish! It's so warm! We enjoyed ourselves like children. What would it be like doing this in my room... ...I wondered. Here's fine. Here. Have some. Thanks. Deep-fry... egg... Have some of this, too. Have lots. Uh... tea... I only have this cup. You don't mind? An indirect kiss. One more... can I have one more? Your band's in the school festival? Yeah. I'll come and cheer for you. Great. Look! A date! A date! Yeah, a date! I thought about running over and punching them in the head. But she might have been enjoying it. I hate that! Well... I guess I'd better go. I'll walk you. That's OK. Someone might see us and start gossiping. Yeah? I had a great time. Me, too. My face is burning. Oh, you're back? What's wrong? Your face is all red. Just sunburn. You stayed in the sun till you got that burned? Stupid! - The girl too? - Yeah. You're both stupid. Get that, will you? Fujiwara... - How was lunch? - How did you know?! - Fun, huh? - What was? She called me. She wanted to do something... ...for her last summer of high school. I said to take lunch to the beach with you. But why did she have to call you? Why didn't she just call me? That question's proof you're socially inept. Sweet dreams tonight. Love. Love. Love. Love. But I'm tired... so tired I could drop. Fujio... ...really... ...thank you, Goda Fujio. And thank you, Tomoto Yukiyo. The dreams I had that night? That would be embarrassing. Mr. Terauchi died that fall. He didn't look like he had a weak heart... ...but he still drank too much. The doctor warned him, and his wife was worried. His wife? I didn't know Mr. Terauchi was married. There's more... the wedding he was at when he died... ...was Miss Momoko's. Miss Momoko's wedding? One moment, please. Right! Oh! This bride can drink! I'll dance this if it kills me! I'm sure he didn't mean it... ...but that's what we heard he said when he started. He wasn't singing Nagasaki Woman, was he? No, it was Ginza 9's in the Ocean, by Kanbe Ichiro. Fujio got the whole story. The owners of the restaurant belonged to his temple. Mr. Terauchi had been drinking somewhere else earlier... ...and the night before was playing mahjong until dawn. It was some sort of three-man version... ...so Fujio told us. Yeah... Miss Momoko's from Nagasaki, isn't she. That's right. Are you all right? I suddenly thought it was too bad she was from Nagasaki. I don't know why I thought that. I can't say what difference it would have made if she wasn't. Then suddenly... Are you all right...? You're OK, aren't you? I'm hot... I can't breathe... Are you all right?! "I'm hot... I'm hot... I'm so hot I can't breathe"... They said his last words were spoken strangely distinct... ...as if he were angry. I'm sorry! Did I hurt you? I'm always in too much of a hurry. Now I prefer Nagasaki Woman to You Are My Sunshine. Indicative and subjunctive: in the real world, truth and lies! That night I woke up crying. I'd never done that before. I remembered when I was small and I pissed the bed. Hot... then cold... and sad. The night before the school festival. See you later. - See you. - Hurry! - Can I eat right away? - Oh, hello. Don't you want a bath? I'll just wash my hair. I can't catch cold. - Sorry? - Nothing. Are you going back out? We're all sleeping over at the school. We'll get up at 5 to practise. A last rehearsal... Hurry and eat, then. Will you need a lunch? Yes, please. Bye! Takeyoshi! - There. - Thanks! Leave it open. Oh... off again? Yeah. The big day! Yep. - What's the schedule? - Look in my briefcase. The program's in there. I see. I'm staying over at the school tonight. You are, eh? The big day! My hair was clean, light. The night breeze felt good in it. I didn't have a blow dryer yet. Chikkun! Yeah? Come in here. Did you paint these? Your guitar. See you. I'll come by later and help. Hey Takumi! You made it! - Thanks. - Me, too. That night we kicked out the juniors... ...and occupied the rehearsal room. Bui I'm bald! That looks great. Just great! Change your strings tonight. They'll stretch if you do it tomorrow. Around 10, the emergency bell went off. A girl had accidentally pushed the button during a check. Of course, no one was angry. Tomorrow was the school festival! Uh... Good luck. Thanks. We'll do our best. Be sure you come. I'll drop everything to be there. Bye now. Let's go. Are you sleeping here? Yes. We got permission. Well, you'd better get to sleep. It's nearly 12. All right! Good night. - Mr. Usui! - Yes? Come and watch, huh? To see you in your glory? I'll wear my ear-plugs! The day had come. On stage, Megumi was martyred for love. For love I die! This is it. The Rocking Horsemen's first and last really big show. This is it. The closing of the books. Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! The gym's packed. At last! - Aim straight, will you? - It's the excitement. - Did you aim straight? - Yeah, but nothing came out. I'm ready to let it all out! Just about time, huh? Good luck. Rocking Horsemen! Rocking Horsemen... our first and last really big show. Everyone came out to see us... ...as if the glissando had drawn them in. Our Takumi! They've started! Run, run, run! People I never thought would be there... ...the girl I'd met the day before... ...they all came to see us. - You made it! - Great, huh? Thank you. I'd like to introduce The Rocking Horsemen to you. Behind us, on drums, setting straight and tall... the Octo... ...er... Kanonji's drummer of the century... ...third year, Class 8, Okashita Takumi! Takumi! On lead guitar, standing off to the side, loooking shy... ...step forward, now... face front... When he plays I don't know if it's Gods or Devils in him. The maestro, third year, Class 5... ...Shirai Seiichi! Come on, take a bow. Good, well done! The guy standing next to me may look a little strange... ...but he's cute, isn't he. On lead vocals and rhythm guitar... ...and the leader of the band, I guess you could say... ...my classmate for three years... third year, Class 10... ...Fujiwara Takeyoshi! Coming to me at last... I play bass, sing harmony... ...and give moral direction to these poor last lads. I'm Goda Fujio... ...third year, Class 10. Thank you very much. Here's a Beatles song... Which one? Yes! I Feel Fine. And I sing, too! Thank you very much! No, we're not done yet! Sure we'll keep playing! Chikkun... ...introduce the next song. Ladies and gentlemen... Three years ago now... ...I heard the intro to Pipeline and I went all numb. For me it was... ..."electric liberation"... ...a sign from the Gods in electricity. And so for the three years of high school... ...The Rocking Horsemen have played... ...rock... ...rock... If you asked me to play one song in the world of rock... ...I would, my friends... ...I would with deep gratitude play this one... ...Johnny B. Goode. My story is reaching its end. The school festival was a triumph. What more is there to say? During the winter break I got a letter from my brother. "This is no time to flounder around." "If you don't make university this year you can try the next." "But try this year all the same." "In one part of your mind imagine a desperate old man..." "...chasing you with a carving knife." "Re-read what you've studied in the past three years." "Make new notes, and memorize them." "It shouldn't be a problem. You've learned it all once." "You can remember it." "Read supplementary material if you can." "Learn to grasp the meaning of long sentences." "Don't bother buying great thick reference books." "Then, early to bed and early to rise." "Make sure you eat, shit and sleep properly." "There's no fast cure for rock 'n' roll..." "...so hear it and sing it when you want to relax." "There should be enough time for that." "One thing you should avoid is television." "There'll be time for that later." "If you do all that, you're sure to pass your entrance exams." "Don't worry. I know some people." Of course, I didn't do everything he told me... ...but I do think I tried my best. But part of me felt empty. Everyone was starting out on their way. I was the only one without a road. Here you are... Small town, isn't it. You studying for your entrance exams? Not much. You should be. I'll probably fail anyway. Which schools are you trying for? I won't make the National ones. Why not? Sciences hate me. So what'll you try for? Don't know. Not much help, are you. Your parents will pay for it, won't they? That's fantastic. You should be trying a little harder. You're the band leader, aren't you? Do your job! Get on. Hold on. Like homosexuals. I had my ticket to Tokyo... ...and my parents had bought me a new coat. The day before I was to leave to take my entrance exam... ...I didn't sleep. I left the house early. I went wherever my feet carried me. We'd given the Club key to the juniors... ...so I can't get in. ...so I can't get in. It was over for everyone. "Are you really getting on?" said a voice in my head. "Yes, I am getting on," I answered. Welcome back. It must've been cold. Even fools get the flu, you know. What are you doing here? Waiting for you. But why? Why are you guys all waiting for me? You weren't home, so your mother called us... ...asking if you were at our places. I realized you'd be wandering around to all the band places. So we met here. But you didn't know when I'd be back. Or even if I'd be back. No. You aren't the type to just leave home like that. We knew you'd be back. Too bad I'm not. No. If you were, we'd just let you leave anyway. But why did you all wait, anyway? I'm not a child. To give you your bandleader- for-life certificate. "Bandleader-for-life"? By unanimous vote. Come on. "Fujiwara Chikkun:" "Chikkun"? Yes. "Chikkun"... "You have most honorably performed your duties..." "...as leader of The Rocking Horsemen." "We hereby recognize that the glory we enjoy today..." "...and the depth of meaning high school has had for us..." "...are due entirely to your abnormal enthusiasm and effort." "The Rocking Horsemen appoint you Bandleader for Life." "St. Valentine's Day, 1968. Honorary member..." "...Taniguchi Shii-San..." "...Shirai Seiichi..." "...Octop", er, no... "...Okashita Takumi..." "...Goda Fujio." Your nose is running. Thank you. Thank you. You don't have to thank us. We didn't buy you anything. I... You guys... ...have been real good to me. I'm embarrassed. I mean it... ...real good. What's wrong with that? Can't you be good to someone? It's hard work being rough on them all the time. OK. OK. But now I'm Bandleader for Life, The Rocking Horsemen... ...are breaking up. At university you get holidays. Summer... winter... spring... When you come home on vacation, we'll rock 'n' roll. Check out the music in Tokyo. Get things from different people. Write some songs, too. Words and music. This is just the start. I think you can do it. Write us a good tune and we'll play it. Sure. But first I've got to get into university. I might have to wait a year and try again. What does shohosen mean? "Prescription", maybe? Who wrote Addiction? Iwano Homei. Write "embrace". This... ...then this... ...and this? Factor 6x²+7x-3. Two three's are six, so... ...(3x-1)(2x+3). Correct. Great! You've studied. You'll pass. No problem! Good luck. At 7:37 a.m. on February 15, 1968... ...I left Kanonji for Tokyo... ...and I prayed. "I don't know what life may have in store for me..." "...but all you good old songs..." "...preserve me." ...of high school The Rocking Horsemen have played... ...rock... ...rock... If you asked me to play one song in the world of rock... ...I would, my friends... ...I would with deep gratitude play this one... ...Johnnv B. Goode.
