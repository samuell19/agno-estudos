Hello. Byomkesh Bakshi speaking. Which number are you trying to connect? No. It's wrong number. What can we name him? You are busy with it again? Either throw him out or we'll have to shift it to some other place. Or someone will lose his life. Snake is a strange creature. You can blame anyone of being spineless but not snakes. It's all spine. Basuki (snake). Dundhubi (snake). The way your cases have dried up.. ..I've decided to start writing a romantic novel instead of Byomkesh diaries. It won't help. - What do you mean? You won't be able to? You just need to know the craft. Pure love is fake. Why are you so cynical? Analyze it and you'll find my words to be true. Jealousy, suspicion, small lies, deception is bound to be there. There can't be relationships without them. It may not be true for every relation. No. No. In today's world that's the norm. True love may be possible in Mars. But, that won't help your novel. It'll sound silly. For example the Shakespearean plays. There's no play without murder. How many deaths do you see in 'Hamlet'? At least four. Take the example of Rabindranath Tagore. Let's start with 'Chokher Bali'. There can't be novels without illicit relationships. What do you say, Ajit? Is there any? I was planning to write a simple love story but you.. Well, it's very important for the literature to be complex. Why only literature? You also.. Thank God! Let's welcome the client. Mr. Bakshi? - Yes. Come in. greetings. Let me introduce him. He's my friend Mr. Ajit Chakraborty. What's up? Let me help you. - Thank you. How about a coffee? - Coffee? Not bad. He? - He stays with me. Oh, I see. Well, get black coffee for me without sugar. Ok? - Yes. Thanks. - Have a seat. Have a seat. Plastic. With my compliments. Wonderful! Thank you. Golap Colony. Don't you've a stall in new Market? I've not one but two stalls there. Thanks. One sells flowers and the other one sells dairy products. - Oh! Is this your colony? - Yes. The bungalow that you see is my bungalow. The houses that you see around it houses inmates. Inmates? Is it something like an ashram (Rehabilitation)? Somewhat. But, they are not sages. - I see. Except the gardener all of them belong to a decent family. But, they are special in their way. - Like what? Either they've physical defects, some of them. Or they've done something for which they won't get shelter elsewhere. Criminals? And social outcastes. Help yourself. But. isn't it risky for you? Actually Mr. Byomkesh, you can consider it a repentance from my side. Repentance? Look, during the 12 years that I was a judge.. ..I gave death sentence to 22 people. I've 57 years old right now. I suffered a mild stroke at the age of 47. After that I retired from service. After retirement I started repenting. A feeling of doubt. I started doubting the basic structure of law. After all, I'm a human being. What right do I've to end the existence of another fellow human? You can term it as my weakness. But.. Well, I understand. The people whom you once condemned are getting rehabilitated. Right? What's wrong f they get redemption? After all, they are living in a beautiful locality. A garden of roses. What else can be more beautiful than a rose? But, roses also have thorns. You are here to talk about the thorns. Right? Not quite. Mr. Byomkesh, will you come and have a look at my place? You don't seem to be busy. - You are right. Then come and spend some time there. You'll like it. After all it's a new experiment. Ajit, what do you say? - I'm always ready. But not always. His wife is in Ghatshila at the moment. - I see. You are a bachelor. - Yes. I suggest you come tomorrow. There' a convenient train from Sealdah at 8:35. My coachman Muskil Miaan will be at the station. Muskil Miaan will be at the station with the carriage. You won't have any problem. Did you come here to invite us? Do you watch Bengali films? - Not much. I hope you are interested in music. - Yes, I am. But, I'm not interested in modern Bengali songs. I'm not talking about modern Bengali songs. Have you ever heard the song.. 'Bhalobasar Tumi Ki Jano?' (what do you know about love?) 'Bhalobasar Tumi Ki Jano?' I heard this song around seven years back in some Bengali film. Which film was it? who produced it? When was it produced? Who sang that song? I wish to know the answers to the above questions. Well.. did you call the office of any film magazine? No.. that's because I want that the work is done by.. Me? - Yes. Ok. - Good. Well.. were you ever in Lucknow? Oh I see! It shows that I've come to the right person. Here you go. - Thank you. What's this? You are so smart. Didn't you get what it's for? Oh! Now I know. - Advance. Ok, Dr. Watson. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'm meeting both of you tomorrow. - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye.

No one pays sixty. They pay either 50 or 40. If anyone pays more than 50 then they usually pay 75. But, not 60. - Forget it. He is a rich man. 10 rupees doesn't make any difference to him. What do you think? Well, you had a friend who was screenplay writer. Indu? - Yes. Call him. Tell him to get an appointment with Ramen Mallik. Ramen Mallik of Beleghta. - The encyclopedia of cinema.

I hope you remember? Yes. I've written it down. Go straight to King Corporate. Do you also practice homeopathy? Do I need to give a list of what I do? Giridhari. - Sir! It'll take a whole night if I start talking about myself. I came to you for help. First tell me what will you have? What will you have? - Anything that you have. I hope you don't have problem with anything. - I don't but.. Yogurt drink? Giridhari, get two whiskey and soda. Get chilled lassi for him in a big glass. You are a detective right? Private eye. What method do you follow? Berdio? FBI? Goblianear? Which one? No.. I follow my own methods.. Are your investigations based on finger prints or cranium. Well, my investigation is based on evidence and observation. One who smokes cigar has nicotine stains on his finger. You should also taken up the profession of a detective. How can I help you? I want some information about a 'gaan' (song). Gun? - No music. Music? - Yes. Which song? I'll definitely help you if I know anything. 'Bhalobasar Tumi Ki Jano'. This is the song. 1958. This song was sung by the character of Kamala Mani.. ..in G K Productions 'Bishbriksha'. No payback singer was used. The actress sang this song. Anything else? The name of the heroine was.. - Sunetra. Sunaina. Yes. That's right. This was her first and last film. - Yes.. there was some problem.. Dutta Das and Company. - Jewelers. Murari was the son of Dutta family. He was murdered. - Stabbed. Yes. Stabbed. Yes. Yes. A warrant was issued in the girl's name. But, nothing happened. Now I remember. Even if you remember it, you won't remember everything.. ..because you don't know everything. Murari was my friend. - Oh! He was a nice person. He had some vices like alcohol and woman. Many people have such vices. One day he went to the sets of 'Bishbriksha'. He saw Sunaina there. He was head over heels in love with her. What happened after that? - Well, what usually happens. He didn't pay heed to anything. He was after me day and night. Chains, necklaces, bracelets, bangles.. - What? He gifted her everything. There was a room behind the shop. A nice room for chatting. They would drink and enjoy music there. I would also go there some times. One day Murari brought her there. That's all. I stopped going there from that day. He was killed. What was the motive? Money. 20,000 rupees went missing. From where? - The safe in that room. But, why was a warrant issued in the name of Ms. Sunaina? Because she was in that room that night. - Oh! So, the police knew it. Did you inform them? I thought of helping my dead friend by doing by duty. But, it didn't help. All efforts were in vain. What was your impression about the girl? She is an extremely talented actress. She has great sex appeal. We didn't know anything about her. Which family she belonged to, where she came from.. ..what was her background and foreground I knew nothing. So, I didn't proceed with her. So, you had also fallen for her? Anyone would've. Even you. Then you would know what's falling in love is. Mr. Ramen, we'll leave now. Thanks a lot. Shall I ask something? Sure. - What's the matter? Matter?

The phone was hanging like this. I think either he has just picked up the phone or was calling someone.. ..when he was hit. - Right. Let's go outside. The case isn't complex. I wanted you to come here to see this place and the people living here. You can write a novel on it. What do you say, Mr. Ajit? That is the rear view. This is a hard land. You won't find any footprints here. The land beyond this wall is soft land. We've found some footprints there. Did you see it? - Yes, I have. There are both running and walking footprints. The locality on the other side is infested with burglars. I think that it's a simple case of burglary. Someone had come to steal. The owner was present at that time. He was intercepted. He hit him on the head and escaped. What do you mean? You don't agree with me? He was hit on the bed. The dead body was dragged to the bed, covered with blanket.. ..and then he escaped. Oh! yes! Yes! That's true. Of course. How is she? - Better. But, it won't be right to disturb her at the moment. - Yes. You are a doctor. What's your opinion after seeing the dead body? Will it be right to speak? I don't think I've the right anymore. Do you play the sitar? The mark on your finger s not from any surgical knife I suppose. You are a good observant. Don't you recognize him? He s Mr. Byomkesh Bakshi. - Oh I see! Oh you don't see. You don't know me. - Well... You were playing raga Malkosh last night. right? I'll go around the colony. What happened, mister? Were you really playing it? Strange! Do the gardeners who work here stay here? No. they come, work and then go back. Mr. Bijoy, for how long have you been living with your uncle? For around 14 years. Is there any secret in your uncle's life? I don't know about anything that happened here. Anything before that? I was very young at that time. Who smokes beedi (local cigarette) here? Muskil, the coachman smokes beedi. And there I a boy called Panu who smokes beedi. When did your uncle get married? In 54. In Lucknow. He married at a ripe age. - Yes. Who will get uncle's property? - Property? Isn't there a will? - Maybe. Don't you know anything about it? - Yes, I know. Who will get his property? Aunt and me. Equal share? - Yes. Equal share. For how long were you with Mr. Nishnath? - Yes? In Lucknow? - 6 years. So, you went astray after that. I know everything about you. I can't explain how much I regretted the action when I was in jail. May I know what you were doing after 10 last night? I had dinner at 9:30. After dinner, I came to my room and lay on my bed. The doctor was playing the sitar. He plays really well. I was lying down listening to his music. I don't remember when I fell asleep. I can assure you that I never lied after I was released from jail. But, have you ever hid any truth? Please forgive me. I can't say anything more. Do you know me? You saw my photo. Right? What happened? Why are you scared? Will you say something? Were you smoking beedi beside the pond last night? Greetings, sir. He was a nice man. When do you sleep at night, Muskil Miaan? I? I don't see the time, I just fall asleep. I'm a sound sleeper. I fall asleep the moment I lie on the bed. Don't mosquitoes bite you? - Bite me? They don't bite me. There's no blood in my body. Greetings, sir. Muskil's wife. That's Rashik's house. He is missing since last night. Uncle had some arguments with him. Regarding what? - About money. Was he cheating? Maybe. - I see. Come, sir. Come. I've kept the chairs for you. Be seated. - Thank you. I've only one side of the face to shave. So my expenses are also half. You are Prof. Nepal Gupta. Right? - Ex-professor. The professor is dead. Murdered. An ex-Marx despot. You are the seeker of truth Byomkesh. Right? You maybe a renowned personality.. ..but it's not an easy job to unravel the truth of this zoo. That's why I came to talk to all of you. This is a hot bed of scandals. The flowers are used to camouflage the truth. Have you camouflaged yourself too? Look, I've spoken the truth from the very first day.. ..about myself and also about the other inmates. You'll find the details in my notebook. Have you noted down the incidents of last night too? Take a look. Have you noted down the incidents of last night too? I had forecast it. I would've told you but I can't say anything because of.. ..the presence of a person here. Will you also tell them that you wanted to become the owner of the colony? You always criticized uncle. Do you think your uncle was beyond criticism? Was he a pure pious great soul? The words don't suit you, uncle Nepal. If I say.. - Yes, say it. You'll get arrested. - Ok. Ok. Fine. Won't you go through this? - Later. Come. I lived out of the country for many years. This is your dispensary. My everything. Have a seat. Have a seat. Your sitar. How did you know that I was playing Raga Malkosh? Well, you had a foreign medical degree. Right? Well, they may've snatched my license but I still have the knowledge. But, it seems meaningless now. A person can't be judged with his merit and intelligence. A person is judged on basis of some senseless rules and regulations. You mean that the if a talented person does something wrong.. ..he doesn't become unworthy. Unworthy? Never. Of course he is culpable. But, that too in the eyes of law. Law is inconsistent. Very interesting. If a girl become pregnant out of wedlock.. ..the society will stigmatize her if she gives birth. If a doctor wishes to save that girl what's his fault. The girl is also not guilty. Can men control their natural responses? Music and medicine. It's a rare combination. Einstein also played the violin. I hope you know. - Yes, I do. I had almost given up music. I'll sit and listen to your music some day. Is your combination music and criminology? Sherlock Holmes also played the violin. That's interesting. - I also play but I play the gramophone. Greetings. - Greetings. My name is Byomkesh Bakshi. My habit is to ask questions. But, I don't question unnecessarily. Will you question me? - Hmm.. Where did you learn this? It's not a difficult job. Do you work at night too? - Yes. How late do you work? - Till 10-11. You were working last night too? - Yes. Didn't you hear your neighbor play the sitar? Why do you ask? Well, if you've any objection we can't force you but.. I'll be happy if you don't question about him. Can I ask why? - I can't answer you. Please pardon me. Mr. Bijoy.. - Hmm.. ..can you throw some light on this matter? Once she wished to learn the sitar. She went to Dr. Das? - Yes. Then? But, I think Dr. Das.. - Gave her an indecent proposal? Maybe. Dr. Das doesn't look like that. May I know what you were doing at 10 last night? - I? I was sleeping. - At 10? No, I mean.. ..there isn't anything much to do here. You don't have the habit of reading, I suppose. - No. I mean that the lights here aren't strong enough. So, it's a problem. Case was instant. - I see. He had high blood pressure. He was hit at the most sensitive spot. Can you guess the time of murder? Between 10-11. I can't give you accurate.. 10:10. What do you mean? He was killed at 10:10 pm. Who is he? I'm sorry. He is the famous seeker of truth Byomkesh Bakshi. Maybe so. It's difficult to be so definite. Goodbye. Mister, are you into telepathy or is it just a coincidence. How is Mrs. Sen? - She is better. Do you wish to meet her? Mr. Bakshi is here. He wants to talk to you. Please come in. My sincere condolences with you. I knew Mr. Sen. I've been handed the responsibility to solve this case. I want to ask you a couple of questions.. ..only if you don't mind. You found out this morning. Right? He wakes up early in the morning. But today he didn't wake up. So.. - It's ok. What were you doing at 10 last night? Do you remember? I was in the kitchen arranging the utensils.. Was your husband very careful about his money? Not at all. Can you say something about this accident? Anything. Everything.. is dark. What do you say, Mr. Ajit? It's a strange case. Well, you used decent words. If you had come here before you would've said it's terrible. It's terrible because two days back the man who.. What did you say? I mean the man who was alive yesterday.. Why are you talking about two days back? The man was alive last night. - Yes. How is your blood pressure? High or low? Low. And yours? Mine is on the higher side. I need to get myself checked. I need to use my brains a lot in near future. Do you think so? I think I can arrest the culprit within two days. Do you think so? Do you see the leg space in my car? If you opt for any other car you'll feel cramped. And everything will be over if you meet with an accident. How old is your car? - 35. Human heart has become small these days. Yes, his pockets too. He is Pulak Chakroborty, the director of 'Bishbriksha'. The enemy of the producers. Sir, do you wish to hear only the song? Show him whatever he wishes to see and hear. Other than 'Bishbriksha' has any other film based.. ..on Bankim's novel flopped? Shall we go ahead? - Yes. Go ahead. Sit near the fan. I'll leave now. - Ok. Arrange tea for us. So, you've connections with all the movie halls of Kolkata? - Yes, I do. But, I never took any advantage. I always bought tickets of royal circle and watched the movies. Do you get me, Mr. Ajit? Good songs, good films, good objects and good.. I was never stingy in these four matters. Good songs, good films, good objects and good.. I was never stingy in these four matters. - How is it? It's been recorded. What's wrong? Sir, the print is seven years old. I hope we can hear the song. - Yes. I also hope that the heroine can be recognized. Isn't it? You've worked with Ms. Sunaina. Right? How was she? She was a terrific actress. - Terrific actress. As if he knows everything. This is a big problem. He has written me to go there. How do I leave work and go there? Shall I go there with son? Will you go? Just now you said that he needs suggestion. What shall you do there? He doesn't need suggestion about money matters. It's a suggestion regarding matters of heart. Matters of heart? Do you understand the matters of heart better than me? Yes, I do. "What do you know about love?" "What do you know about love?" "What do you know about love?" "You relax.." "..and go through the accounts book." "You relax an go through the accounts book." "You are busy with your work.." "You are busy with your work." "You don't listen to me when I ask you to stop working." "You don't listen to me when I ask you to stop working." "What do you know about love?" "What do you know about love?" "Mister, what do you know about love?" "Didn't you notice in the garden.." "..that in the ears of the rose.." "Didn't you notice in the garden that the buds whisper in the ears of rose?" "Didn't you hear it?" "The buds whisper in the ears of rose." "Didn't you hear it?" "The buds whisper in the ears of rose." "Didn't you hear the birds chirp from the trees?" "Didn't you hear the birds chirp from the trees?" "Whom does he look for?" "Whom does he look for?" "Why is he restless today?" "Why is he restless today?" "What do you know about love?" The film is tattered one just like its director. That's not a problem. I've got what I wanted. Oh! the stills for you, sir. - Thank you. Well, the song is very nice. - Yes. Where did this lady stay? During the shooting? Ask me. They offered to send her a car but she refused. - I see. She came to the studio by trams or buses or sometimes by taxi. Was she married? - Yes. Married. She had hinted that her relation with her husband wasn't good. I see. That's all. Let's go. - Let's go. I love this picture gallery thing you create. Do you get me, Byomkesh? Just praising it isn't enough. You must sit for a test. - What? Test? First tell me who amongst these four women is the most beautiful. Well, this can't be a test. It depends on your taste. Ok, let me see what you feel. Ok, tell me Damayanti, Banalakshmi, Mukul or Nazar Biwi? Who amongst these four do you think is most attractive? Who haunts you the most? Come on, tell me. No laughing it away won't help. Whom did you dream about last night. - Stop it. I've crossed that age. - Strange! Why don't you say who is most beautiful? Come on, tell me. - Wait. I'll tell you. The most beautiful amongst all of them is perhaps Mrs. Damayanti. So, you are attracted towards another's man's wife. You asked me the question. - Ok. Anything else? - I met her for a very short time. Yet what impression did she leave on you? Her husband's death has shattered her. It means she loved her husband a lot. - Isn't it? Possibly. But, only if she isn't feigning grief. How can she feign grief at this moment Yes. The name Damayanti isn't.. - A common name amongst Bengalis. What about her? She is interesting. You are trying to avoid the topic. Speak clearly. I mean she has a simple rustic appeal. But her experiences have adulterated her simplicity. Which experience? The way she was cheated and trafficked out of her village. Is there any evidence that she is speaking the truth? What about her? Do you've any evidence to prove that she is his daughter.. ..and she is his second wife? You are complicating matters. I'm not doing anything. It's the truth. Do you get it? A murder and a blackmail. A murder in 58 and now another one in 66. Do you think both the murders have a connection? Mr. Nishanath suspected that Ms. Sunaina was perhaps.. No.. Are you convinced about the blackmail? The motor parts incident clearly proves that he was being blackmailed. If there's any mystery in Nishanath's past life.. ..then getting blackmailed is natural. Who do you think can blackmail him? - Yes? Who can blackmail him? Number one suspect is Damayanti. Second is Bijoy. Third suspect is Nepal Gupta. Don't forget that he was his classmate. And the fourth suspect is Braja Das, his employee. Nazar Biwi had the habit of eavesdropping. If she had known a secret then Muskil also knew about it. If they had shared the secret with anyone else in the colony.. ..then the matter becomes more complicated. If someone wishes to blackmail him then why did he kill him. That's what I'm thinking about, Ajit. Come in. come in. - Greetings. I got your address from the telephone directory. - Have a seat. What's the matter? May I get a glass of water, please? I'm really hurt, Mr. Byomkesh. I'm really hurt. When I was in jail I had vowed that I won't lie and do anything wrong. So, I adopted Vaishnav religion. I tried hard and devoted myself to a religious life.. ..and to Lord Krishna. But, it's wrong to hide the truth. If I hide the truth about the murder of the person.. ..who gave me shelter then I'll be committing a grave sin. It's ok. Please try to calm down. - How can I? He was a great man, a renowned judge. He was also a seeker of truth. Isn't it? But, what if you bring a remarried woman home.. ..and introduce her as your wife to everybody then.. Wasn't Mrs. Damayanti married to Mr. Nishanath? No. The death sentence wasn't carried out. Whose death sentence? - Death sentence of Mrs. Damayanti's husband. Sir gave him death sentence. They appealed in the High Court. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison. So, the accused was Mrs. Damayanti's husband? - Yes. Laal Singh. - Punjabi? She is also a Punjabi. Mrs. Damayanti is a Punjabi woman? - Yes. Did Mr. Sen teach her Bengali? I can't forget that day, Mr. Byomkesh. Will you please speak clearly? The way he stared at the judge that day. The judge was announcing his judgment. He gave him death sentence. I sentence you to death. And you'll be hanged by the neck until you are dead. Mr. Byomkesh, Laal Singh opened his shoe and.. ..threw it at the judge. Few days after this incident.. ..sir wasn't well, he was working from home.. ..when the servant informed that a lady had come to visit him. Go and check who has come. If it isn't important tell her that I can't meet her right now. I saw a Punjabi lady waiting at the door. Laal Singh's wife. She was an attractive woman. She said that she won't leave without meeting the judge. She said she won't budge from there. I had no other option. I took her inside. I've committed only one sin, sir. I married him. We had a love marriage. I didn't know that he wasn't a good man. Sir, you've announced your decision on him. But, who'll decide my case? I'm innocent. What have you decided? I don't have money or children. I couldn't stay in the room after seeing the expression on the judge's face. Mr. Byomkesh, I felt uncomfortable. I never saw such a look in his eyes before. After that.. after that the lady often visited him. One day I saw the judge come home in his car. But the driver wasn't driving. Sir was driving the car. I thought that something is wrong. My fears came true. He had brought home Laal Singh's wife. She didn't leave after that day. She stayed back forever. My mind changed after that day. The person whom I respected and revered so much.. ..had done something illicit. I was an ordinary clerk. Why should I suffer in penury? Why don't I make my life more comfortable? Is theft a more serious crime than what he did? So.. So, you stole because you lost faith in your employer. - Yes. Well, after some time I repented my actions. When I was in jail I thought that we shouldn't judge someone.. ..on basis of just one thing. I had a human relation with Mr. Nishanath. There was no change in our relationship. I didn't have the right to judge his character based on something else. I repented my action. I repented. Ok, Mr. Braja Das. You've helped us a lot by sharing all this. Thanks a lot. I couldn't sleep the last three nights. You can sleep peacefully now. Is Laal Singh still alive? I know that he was not hanged till death. Well, fourteen years of his sentence is also almost over. What was his profession? He was the owner of a motor garage. He killed his partner over an argument regarding some motor parts. Who is there? I was confused about which news I should give you first on phone. Murder has become a norm. Did you anticipate the second murder? I should've, Mr. Promod. I should've known that the boy had seen something that day. Witness sis an evidence. Evidence means his life was at risk. The criminal is dangerous. It's the same person. He was hit on the head in the similar manner. So, you couldn't catch the murderer in two days. How would I know that this case also has a blackmail angle to it? The case is complex. Has he confessed everything? - Everything. That's also a strange story. He was imprisoned for fourteen years. But, he was released after 12 years because of good conduct. He started searching the judge after he was released. He already knew that his wife was living with the judge. He came to Mohanpur. He checked out the colony from outside and went back to Kolkata. After going back to Kolkata he wrote a blackmail letter to Mr. Sen. He would drop a motor spare part in his room at regular interval. After that he should keep 500 rupees in the hot house in a flower pot.. ..within 10 the next day. Have you informed Mrs. Damayanti that.. ..her husband has been arrested? - No, sir. You've to give her the news. I'll question all of them today. Play the music. Dr. Pal is here. I'll take care of the things there. Come in. I'll give you little trouble. But, it's important. - Ok. Have a seat. Your husband was arrested last night. Do you know that? Laal Singh. The person for whom you kept 500 rupees in the hot house. He has confessed everything. You had no other option but to give the money. Right? You are right. If I didn't give him the money he would spread scandals in my name. I couldn't let that happen. The treatment I got from him.. The judge is my husband and not him. He is not my husband. Ok, Mrs. Damayanti. You may leave now. Nepal Gupta. - Present, sir. How long will you display your efficiency? Not too long. Well Mr. Nepal.. - Yes, tell me. Why are you angry with Mr. Bijoy? Because.. I can't tolerate a characterless person.. ..and someone who breaks his promise. That's all. He proposed marriage to a simple innocent girl. She accepted the proposal. But, the person broke his promise and.. ..ran after a fallen woman can commit murder and theft too. Can I assume that this simple innocent girl is your daughter? Of course. Won't you ask who this other girl is? No. Thank you. I wish to talk to your innocent daughter now. Thank you. Thank you. Mukul, go in. Will you question me? - Yes, that's what I wish to do. What if I don't answer any question? You are free not to answer. Please be seated. Can you sing? - Yes, a little. Did you learn music? - No. Do you hum songs? It depends on the state of mind I'm in. I can hum if I'm in good mood. Do you remember what happened on the night Mr. Nishanath was killed? Yes, I do. What were you doing that night? I was standing near the window. Did you hear anything? - Yes. I heard the buzzing of the crickets, cry of the wolves.. ..the music played by the doctor. Did you hear the sound of the sewing machine? It wasn't in use at that time. Well, did Mr. Bijoy propose you. - Yes. Why didn't it materialize? - I don't wish to comment on it. Ok. You may leave now. Ms. Banalakshmi. Like master, like servant. He was hit on the head and died immediately. The murder was committed after 10 at night. What happened? How far have you progressed? Any breakthrough? The matter is quite interesting. I would've been happier if the culprit got arrested. Have a seat. May I know the name of your village? Village? You were born and brought up in a village before coming to the city. Right? Oh yes! Chanberia. District? - Hoogly. How did you come to the city? I.. I was.. Where did you live in Kolkata? I didn't have a home. I lived in the slums. Why did you wish to learn the sitar? I love music. Can you sing? For how long have you been married? - For a long time. Where did you learn music? Music? - Don't you know how to sing? Yes, I do. - From where did you learn? Radio. Gramophone. Films. Where were you eavesdropping last night? Were you near Panu Gopal's hut when he was murdered? That's a problem, sir. I told you that I', out of senses after going to bed. Are you addicted to something? - Addiction? It's a childhood addiction. So, I can't quit. Oh! So, you weren't sleeping. You were in inebriated state. State of unconsciousness and sleep is the same thing. When I sleep I'm not in my senses and vice versa. Are you recording the conversation? Do you've any objection? - Not at all. You were married abroad. So, you've done research on me. Where is she right now? - She maybe there. You didn't bring her along? - No. She suddenly became conscious about the color of my skin.. ..and left me. Well, which degree did you get when you were abroad. What's this? You know about my marriage and not about my degree? Maybe I know but I want to hear it from you. Well, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. Thank you. You may leave now. Bijoy! I? - Yes, it's your turn now. Did you know about Mrs. Damayanti's past? Yes, I did. - didn't you tell us? I thought you would misunderstand. I respect aunt a lot. What about your uncle? - I respected him too. You brought Banalakshmi here. Right? - Yes. Did you feel pity for her after hearing her story? Everybody would've felt pity for her. Do you love her? You broke your promise to Mukul because of her. Isn't it? It's a personal matter. We are curious to know about it. You'll clearly benefit from Mr. Nishanath's death. What are you saying? After falling in love it's not unnatural to think about marriage. You need money to get married. But, as far as I knew your uncle... He wouldn't have given his consent to your marriage with Banalakshmi. Can you refuse your weakness for Banalakshmi? No. - So, you don't? Did she travel to the city? Who? - Banalakshmi. Not at all. But, don't you need to meet each other secretly when you are in love. We met in the colony and not outside. Will you still say that you go to sleep by 10 pm? Believe me, we know nothing about the murder. - We? I was in Banalakshmi's room from 10 to 11:30 that night. Mukul knows about it. You can ask her. Keep an eye on the colony. I should be informed if anyone goes out. She accepted the proposal. But, the person broke his promise and.. ..ran after a fallen woman can commit murder and theft too. He appears to be a man of principles. He had some difference with Nishanath. Bijoy thinks that he wanted to remove Nishanath from his path.. ..so that he can be the head of the colon. Maybe. But.. You think he didn't have a strong motive? Just think about it. Being the owner means your income will increase. Right? But, you can't expect high returns from the business. Think about it more deeply. Well, to openly oppose someone, then kill him and.. ..take up his position.. it's impossible. Only a mad man can do this. Maybe he is not mentally stable. He may not have been in his senses when he murdered him. His eccentricity is just a camouflage. He is a very intelligent person or he wouldn't play chess. If he was angry with anyone then the person is.. ..because of.. But, Nishanath Sen was murdered. No.. Did you hear anything? - Yes. I heard the buzzing of the crickets, cry of the wolves.. ..the music played by the doctor. Did you hear the sound of the sewing machine? It wasn't in use at that time. Did she speak the truth? Was the sewing machine not in use at that time? - I think so. I also think so. Banalaksmi was not working on the sewing machine at that time. But why? - She was romancing Bijoy. Byomkesh, Bijoy has the strongest motive to kill him. He wanted to marry Banalakshmi. Nishanath didn't give his approval. He killed him so that he can inherit his property.. ..marry Banalakshmi and go away from here. Yes, he is one of the prime suspects. But.. Bijoy said that he chatted with Banalakshmi till 11:30. Mukul is the witness. Did Mr. Bijoy propose you? Yes. Why didn't you get married? I don't wish to disclose the details. She doesn't want to say. She doesn't want to say. It means that even though he betrayed me. I won't demean him. It means that Mukul still loves Bijoy. So, Mukul's evidence can't be considered. Out! Out! And out! Don't you suspect Muskil? He looks weird. He not only drinks at night. He was smelling of alcohol even at 9:30 in the morning. Can't a person kill someone in inebriated state? Yes, he can. But, to kill someone at 10 in the night and.. ..then to drag the body to the bed, cover him with a blanket.. ..isn't possible for him. What can be his motive? He is leading a good life. No. This isn't acting. Or it may be very good acting. Where did you live in Kolkata? I didn't have a home. I didn't have a home. I didn't have a home. 'Basa' (home).. 'Basa' (home).. Oh yes! Chanberia. District? - Hoogly. Hoogly? Do people of Hoogly call home 'basa'? What do you say, Ajit? What does your experience say? What? She may use the terms 'ghar' or 'bari' for home but not 'basa'. People of East Bengal use the term 'basa'. Why did she lie? Her whole story proves to be false then. It means she is not someone to be pitied. She made up the story so that people pity her. She did it to get a place in the colony. She wanted to stay away from people. She wanted to hide there. - Right. Yes, but.. How did you come to the city? Where did you live in Kolkata? I didn't have a home. Why did you wish to learn the sitar? I love music. Can you sing? Switch it off. This is strange! They are not present here but their voice can be heard. For example, you are not in the room. But, a tape recorder is playing your voice. Someone hears it and reports that Mr. Byomkesh is in his room. Ajit.. - Alibi. Bravo! Ajit, I'm a fool. A fool. If you are a fool then what am I? You are also a fool. You are also a fool or you would've known why I'm so excited. Scoundrel! Motive? What's the motive? What's the motive? I'm such a big fool. Hello. Thank you. Do it, Byomkesh. Oh no! Sorry. Oh no! Hello. - Hello. Stop! Stop! Stop! Let's go back. Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! Rosie! This is your house? Dr. Das's house? You pay him rent? Thank you. Bye. Do you know the locality? Number nine. The room on the right. Dr. Das's room. It's filled with incriminating documents. I want them tomorrow. Send your men there. Make a list... Hold on for a minute. You may leave now. Deposit money in Banalakshmi's name the way you were depositing till now. Shall I? - Yes. One more thing. Think about the girl to whom you were being unjust. She is not bad, she is a nice girl. Ajit.. - Yes. I want a scissor. A big scissor. Sorry, Mr. Barat. Note it down. Good morning, sir. At first.. ..I would like to talk about a film. In 1958 G K productions produced a movie.. ..based on Bankim Chandra's novel 'Bishbriksha'. Whoever has watched this movie feels that.. ..the most notable thing about the movie was the acting of... ..a new actress named Sunaina who played Kamal Mani. This is her photo. People have not only remembered her but.. ..people also remember a song she sang in her own voice. "What do you know about love?" Ms. Sunaina was a married woman. But no one knew where she stayed and what was her past. No one felt the need to find out. When the shooting of the film 'Bish Briksha' was going on.. ..Mr. Murarai Dutta Dutta das and Company.. ..got introduced to her to her and fell in love with her. He gifted her lot of ornaments from his shop.. ..and fulfilled the duties of a lover. Few days after this development in a room behind.. ..the shop of Dutta Das and Company.. ..Murari was stabbed from behind and.. ..around 20,000 rupees was stolen from the wardrobe. We've the information that Ms. Sunaina was supposed.. ..to visit Mr. Murari on the night of the murder.. ..from a close friend of Mr. Murari, Mr. Ramen Mallik. According to Mr. Ramen, few days after the murder.. ..a warrant was issued in the name of Mrs. Sunaina. But, the lady went missing. This is my introduction to the story. Eight years after this incident, that is seven days back.. ..I heard about Ms. Sunaina in my room.. ..from your late owner Mr. Nishanath. Mr. Nishanath felt that Ms. Sunaina was staying in this colony in disguise. He was of the opinion that either Ms. Banalakshmi, Mukul or Nazar Biwi.. ..is actually Ms. Sunaina. When Mr. Nishanath doubted this, someone in this colony.. ..mercilessly killed him. From the nature of the murder it seems that the murderer is a male. The murder was committed at 10 in the night. When I asked everybody what they were doing at that time that night.. ..many of you had lied. Well, their lies have already been proven. Some of them confessed that they had lied. There's just one person whom I want to ask that question once again. I hope he won't lie today. Dr. Das. Yes, tell me. - You tell me. What shall I tell you? What were you doing on the night of Mr. Sen's murder.. ..instead of playing the sitar? I wasn't playing the sitar? How do you know that I wasn't playing the sitar? Do you have lack of witnesses? Or do you think everybody is lying? The number nine house in Master Lane is yours. Right? We've custody of the tape recorder that you kept there.. ..inside a briefcase yesterday. I must praise your investigation. May I know why you took it there? - Certainly. It wasn't working, it needed to be repaired. It needed to be repaired? - Yes. Strange! It's working properly. Do you recognize the music? Why won't I recognize the music played by me? Isn't it the piece that you were playing on the night of murder. Mr. Bakshi, you don't know that musicians.. ..record what they play. It's a part of their practice. If I say that you weren't playing the sitar that night? It was the tape recorder that was playing the music. When Mr. Nishanath had called me at 10 in the night.. ..you wore these gloves and hit him on the head with a blunt instrument.. ..and killed him. You killed Panu Gopal in the similar manner the following night. In that case I would say that you've lost your mind. You need medical attention. Why will I be mad enough to kill someone without motive? If I say that you had motive. What was my motive? You killed Mr. Nishanath because he suspected.. ..that Ms. Sunaina was staying here. Don't speak nonsense, Mr. Bakshi. Who is Sunaina that I'll kill someone for her? You reveal the truth. Who is Sunaina? I found her ornaments in your wardrobe. This is the contract. I didn't say that I wasn't acquainted to Sunaina. She was my patient. My first abortion case. What happened after that? - What else? I had to take her responsibility or she would've been stranded. She had a good voice and acting talent. I helped her get a film. That's all. What next? - I don't know anything after that. Mr. Byomkesh, will you play that song again? "What do you know about love?" "You relax.." "..and go through the accounts book." "You relax an go through the accounts book." "You are busy with your work.." "You are busy with your work." "You don't listen to me when I ask you to stop working." Is the song that bad? - No. it's quite good. But.. no one gave me another chance. Why did that happen? - "What do you know about love?" Ask him. He is my husband. What is she saying? Has she lost her mind? I've become mad because of you. You pretended that you were in love and tempted me with money. Sunaina! - ..and made me do illegal things. You! You! - Didn't I save you? He has changed my face too. He has committed all the murders. All the murders. Sunaina! What are you doing? Take the reward for doing a hattrick. Oh no! Mrs. Das, come with us. That is why I couldn't recognize Sunaina. Plastic surgery. The idea suddenly struck me when I saw the plastic flowers.. ..on my table. I replaced the nose from Kamal Mani's photo.. ..on Banalakshmi's face and it confirmed my suspicion. Such strange characters! They appear to be something but are actually completely different. That's why I always say that humans can't be trusted. - No. But, I've full faith in Basuki.. - Basuki? I've full faith in Basuki. I can't trust Ajit but I can trust her. Very reliable. - Very. Very. I hope this isn't made of plastic. - No, it's real. Check it out. Touch it and see. Come on, touch it.
