Daddy. [GASPS] [GASPS] You know it will be a year tomorrow from the day I told Jack he had to leave. THERAPIST: He's done a lot of work since then. You all have. Work, well... [SCOFFS] All this therapy. Talking, talking. I want my husband back. I want my children to have their father back the way it was. The way I thought it was. Am I crazy? It's not at all uncommon for families to try to come back together. Are they successful? Some times. Especially families like yours that have reached out for outside support. Individual therapy, family sessions. And with myself as your social worker, it's possible. Tess, how do you feel? Are you ready for your father to come back? Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Uh, I just want everything to be normal again. Mmm. Does this mean dad's coming home? We're talking about it. Well, I hope it's soon. I'm going to go see what's on TV, okay? Okay. There are some things to take into consideration. Respect for personal boundaries. Making sure to knock before entering a room, for instance. How you dress is another. Things like that. I don't think he should go upstairs. We have a den and a fold-out sofa. It's your prerogative to set rules. Um, I've got homework. Is that okay? Yeah. It's fine. Oh, yeah, honey. I'll be back soon. We'll talk then. Okay. Okay, honey. Um, so what's the next step? It's Jack's. For him to return, he'll have to register at the police department as a known sex offender. Oh, my God. It's the law. CAROL: You okay, Tess? Sure. Are we almost there? Almost. You know, Will, I know you're excited about your dad coming home again and everything... But I don't want you to expect too much right away. What do you mean? Well, you know, uh... It's just that everything isn't going to be instantly okay, you know? This is... This is going to be a big adjustment, for everyone. There he is! There's Dad! Dad! Hey, hey, Will! Can I help you, Dad? Sure, grab a bag. Thought maybe you'd changed your mind. No, just a little late. Hi, Tess. Hi, Daddy. Sure glad to be coming home. I've missed you all so much. I'll just throw my things in the back. I can't believe this day is here. I woke up at 4:00 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep. Hey, what do you say I make my famous lasagna tonight? I already defrosted a chicken, okay? Yeah, sure, fine. I'm sick of my own cooking anyway. I'm riding with Dad. Hey, partner. [STARTS CAR] Wow, this looks great, really great. Oh, Will, honey, that goes in the den. CAROL: Just put it in there, would you, honey? Thanks. WILL: But, I thought that... Wait, how come Daddy sleeps here? He'll be fine in here. Don't worry, honey. Yeah, Will, I'll be fine. I'm so glad to be home, I'd sleep under the kitchen table. [LAUGHS] Well, come on out back and we'll play catch. Hey, I'll be right with you, all right? Just give me a minute with your mom. Okay. I f you're uncomfortable here, I... I emptied out a few drawers for you. If you need blankets, there's... Carol, I know where the blankets are. Jack. I'm not complaining. Do you hear me complaining? It's just going to take a little time. One day at a time. I'm going to go... Hey... Tess! I'm fine. Where are you going? Just going for a ride. TESS: I think about him being back home, living with us. I think about it all the time. THERAPIST: Are you afraid? [EXHALES] He's my father. You're not supposed to be afraid of your father. THERAPIST: Then what, Tess? You must feel something? [INHALES] I'm tired, I 'm so tired. I feel like I could sleep for a thousand years. Morning. Hmm. How were the sleeps, kiddo? Great. Tess! She'll sleep all day, if I let her. No grapefruit? No, I'm sorry. I don't eat it and neither do the kids. No problem. Hey, I' d love for you to come down to the store. I'm the manager. The big cheese. Boss. That's right. There's this counter where the contractors come in. It's not fancy, but I'd love for you to s ee it. Oh, I will, I will... Um... Tess! Tess is going to be late. Tess! [DOOR OPENS] What is it? If you want a ride, you better hurry up. I'll ride my bike. Fine, but hurry. Isn't Tess going to be late? Uh, you can just leave her. Carol, I have my own keys. I could just drive around the block and let myself back in. Stop it, Jack. Have a nice day. Give my love to your mother. Welcome home, Daddy. My father was a brutal man. And he drank. But if I... If I was nice to him, if I let him do what he wanted, it seemed to calm him down. And when Will was born, I swore, I would never do to him what my father did to me. I would never touch my son. I was careful with him. I didn't want to hurt Tess. You can see that, can't you? MALE THERAPIST: Is that what you want me to see? Yes, I don't know. I... It's just that nobody lets up. I had to go down to the police station the other day to register as a sex offender. It was so... Humiliating. I'll never touch Tess again, no t in that way. I'd rather die. All marriages have their problems, Carol. Lord knows, everyone has to go through their tough times. Well, it's more than just tough times, Mother. Hmm. Tell it to the therapist. Make him earn his money. It's a woman therapist. Dear, it's all the same. What's the difference? You talk yourself blue in the face, and in the final analysis, it's you and Jack that have to come to some kind of middle ground. Oh, look at this Kachina. Hmm, what village is it? Um... Well, it's Third Mesa. The Hopi Indians believed that the "Kachinas" are divine beings, like angels. Intermediaries between God and man. [CHUCKLES] Sometimes, they come among them, invisible but loving and beneficent. Now days, people don't look to mysticism and belief, they look to their therapist. Write them a check and they'll listen, while you hope for a quick fix. [CHATTERING] Hey, how's it going? Fine, I guess. Are you okay? I wish people would stop asking me that. Well, I don't know, you've been different. You never have much to say anymore, and you hardly ever laugh. What's up? I'm sorry. I'm fine. Really. Okay. I'll see you then? You know the dance is coming up. I was wondering if you'd want to go with me? Okay. Really? It 's not cool to act surprised. [SNICKERS] I wasn't about to leave him there alone with her in the house. Ah, it wasn't good. You know, I thought you said you trusted him. Oh, I want to, but it's so hard. You know with everything t hat's going on, s he's walking around with her bathrobe open. Well, wait a minute, Cindy flounces around half-nude sometimes. Teenage girls just have a way of being unconscious about things. [TIMER BEEPS] Well, Tess doesn't have that luxury. Then, maybe you shouldn't have taken him back. [SIGHS] Is it too much to expect her to keep her robe closed? Carol. I've got to go pick up some stuff at the store. Carol, try to relax, okay? Keep a clear eye. Bye. Bye. THERAPIST: Will, you know why your dad left last year? Dad touched Tess in places. I guess he touched her in places he shouldn't. THERAPIST: Private places. What do you think about that? He said he was sorry though, and you learn from your mistakes, that's what everybody says. So, now can we let him stay? We're setting up the chessboard. Do we have time for a game before dinner? Oh, yeah. You remember the moves? I stayed in Chess Club. You'll probably massacre me. Careful with Tess's trophies, Will. Hey, you know, how's she doing with the skating? I haven't seen her do that in so long. Ah... She quit. What? Why didn't somebody tell me? Just didn't seem very important anymore. [CHUCKLES] Oh, well, honey... But you were so good. Don't give that up. I didn't want to push her, but I really miss the practices and the competition... Worry about a Double Lutz? You know, it kind of seems silly, doesn't it? I 'm just saying it was a good thing. You know, I... TESS: It was my decision, it was my life. I was the one up there on the ice. I was sick of it anyway. Hey, hey, Tess, don't talk to your mom like that. Jack. Well, Carol, you can't let that slide. Come down here and talk about this. Come down here, Tess, and talk about this. No, stop. Will you please? Why do you always have to cause trouble? You ruin everything. That is not the way... Don't run away! Hey! Hey! I'm still their father. She quit because of what happened. Do you understand that? Because of you. So don't you go calling shots around here. Don't you dare! [DOOR OPENS] Still up? Yeah, I couldn't sleep. What a time, eh? Yeah. Carol, I don't blame you for being angry. You know, I know it must've been hard trying to do everything by yourself this past year. And I put you through hell. This is going to be harder than we thought. I think so. [SIGHS] Where do we go from here? Well, that's a hell of a question for 2:00 a.m. Carol, I came back because I want there to be a chance for us. Okay. Don't go. I'm worried about Tess. [SIGHS] May be if she sees that I'm back and things can be normal again. Normal? As if nothing happened? Something happened, Jack. Look, Carol, please. You know I cannot get the image of the two of you out of mind, of finding you two together. We've been over this a hundred times with the therapist. It doesn't get any easier. Do you realize that with all of the appointments and all the counselors we never talked about this, just the two of us. What is left to say? I don't know. Maybe the truth, whatever it is? [EXHALES] I've always said the truth. I've never lied. It happened twice before. I never actually had sex with her. You fondled her? I touched her, yes. Touched her! Jack, I found you with your hand between her legs. What were you t hinking? I wasn't thinking. It had nothing to do with thinking. What did she say? The first time when she realized what you wanted to do? What did she say? She said my name. She said, "Daddy." And then? That's all. And the other times? Not a word. She didn't speak. See, I don't understand that. Why was she so quiet? I mean if the house were on fire, she would've screamed. If someone had walked in the house, well, she should... I don't understand. Carol. I'm trying, Jack! I am trying so hard. I keep thinking about what happened to you when you were a boy, and I try to think that maybe... Carol, stop it. This is not right. We can't do this, not alone. We can't do this without someone to help us. What? We can't talk now without a therapist? This is just too dangerous? Not now, yes. [SIGHS] This is so sad. [EXHALES] I'll leave in the morning. No! No. You are not going anywhere. It would just be too damn easy. You stay. You work this out. [SOBBING] There is another one that I've been saving to show you. And it's very special. [NAMES ARTIST] 1925, mint condition, unrestored, original. Would be a great addition to our collection. I thought you'd like this. CUSTOMER: All right, we'll take it while we can. Good choice. Carol, darling, could you please come and take down the Navajo rug for our customer? What form of payment? Ah, I'll use a card. Good, I'll take a card. [CHUCKLES] You know this is a wonderful piece that you purchased. [CHATTERING CONTINUES] [PANTING] Carol, you let it fall. Carol? A panic attack? It felt like I was going to die. I dropped the weaving. THERAPIST: What was your mother's reaction? Oh, she didn't like that I dropped it. [CHUCKLES] She'd just sold it to someone. THERAPIST: And you were a problem? Well, yeah, what could she do? THERAPIST: Followed you out of the shop, shown her concern for you? Well, you know, you don't understand, I was really okay. THERAPIST: No, you were upset and frightened. And she was inside, ringing up a sale. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Hey, you busy? I just have a paper to do for English. Ah. How is school? School's school. Okay, well, why don't you take a break because I've a surprise for you. It's been a long time since we've redone your room and... It was time, you know, new paint, new curtains, new furniture, everything. What do you think? Why? Well, we haven't done it since you were a child. And I'm not a child anymore. No, you're not. CAROL: I thought it would be a nice change. Yeah, yeah, it's a good idea. We'll just... Paint over everything. Thought it'd be a nice thing to do. Obviously if you don't want it... Mom, look, just leave them here, I'll look at them. It's only paint. Not everything has to mean more than it does. I have to get this assignment finished. Okay, I'll call you when dinner's ready. Hi. What are you reading? A newspaper. An article about global warming. D o you know that on average, temperatures are rising six degrees each decade? Ecosystems are being destroyed, the world will never be the same. Geez. Here I was just trying to make it to next Tuesday. Right. Look, you don't know anything about me. Preppy, school colors on game days... You're Barbie in the flesh. And you? The new girl? Black clothes, eye shadow, attitude. Oh, I'm shocked. Who is this person? You must've wondered, or you wouldn't be standing there. Look, I see you at school. You sit by yourself, you don't talk to anyone. And it doesn't seem like you care. And now you want to be my friend? I don't buy it. Yeah, well, I guess you know everything. RAIN: Hey, wait! You're right I don't know who you are. So, who are you? TESS: I picked black. THERAPIST: You told your mother you wanted to paint your room black? Yes. And? She was insulted. She hurts you, you hurt her back? Seems fair. Tell me more about that. She blames me. She doesn't say it. But... I know. THERAPIST: You're tough. Have to be. Ta - da! And if I remember correctly, what does everyone do at this moment? Oh, this brings back memories. Mmm, yeah! That's right. Remember? And then I make the traditional announcement. Oh, come on. Here we go. The famous family lasagna, handed down, just as my mother made it before her mother. Here we go, again. And her mother before her. [LAUGHING] An d her mother before her and her mother before her. And her mother before her. [LAUGHING] Oh, mother, oh, mom! And her mother actually never made this dish. [LAUGHING] No, no, no, no, no, Will. Will, you can't. I want to sleep with you. No, buddy, uh... You're getting too old for this. You gotta... Go back to your room. But it's okay. There's no rule against it. I missed you. Oh! Look, you, eh, got to go upstairs, you understand? In a minute. No, no, don't go back to sleep. Don't go to sleep on me. Will? Will? Ah, geez! [GRUNTS] What are you doing here? Will came down to the den. I just brought him up. Goodnight, Jack. Well, Carol, I mean, for God's sake, I just... Ah, geez. What is it? "What is it?" I carry my son upstairs and then I'm treated like some criminal. Jack, please, it's late. Carol, I'll sleep in the den, if that's what you want. But I want you to think about what it was like between us before. Before everything, you know? But I want you to remember, because it's worth remembering. We were family, all of us, under one roof, all together. And I believe that's the way it was meant to be. I believe that. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose all this. Help us, please, come together as a family. We're doing all right. We still have a long way to go. But we're moving in the right direction. And, Tess, how about you? Is there anything you'd like to say? [SIGHS] No, there's nothing to tell, really. I mean, I hardly ever see Dad. I mean, I see him, but... He leaves so early for work. And when I get home, I just go up to my room, do homework. Do you eat together as a family? Yeah, oh, yeah. Dad made us his famous lasagna. And we all clapped. It was great. And you've been restricted to the downstairs? How is that, Jack? Well, it's kind of like being under house arrest, but I don't mind. I'll do whatever I have to do. And to your knowledge, has Jack respected that rule? Yes, he has. Good, so things seem on track. Going as well as you'd expect? Yeah. We lied. We sat there and lied. If I'd said that I'd found him in Will's room, well... That'd have been it, they'd have hit us with a court order and he'd be gone. But then what would we do? [SIGHS] [CHATTERING] School dance! It just seems like such a colossal waste of time. You're right. But I think it's a good idea to try to act normal. Even if it is a big lie. I'm anti-social, so educate me. He comes to your house, he's all dressed up right? And then does his dad drive you? I bet we'd walk. I don't live that far from the school. Think he'll bring a carnation in a plastic box? It's called a corsage. Oh! "A corsage." [LAUGHING] I'll let him pin it on my dress as he thinks about my breasts. Tess. Oh, come on, what else would he be thinking about? Oh! Right. All you could think about is the huge carnation massacre. Actually, that's true. Think about all the resources that go into growing them, only to be slaughtered, pins glued to them, worn once and tossed out with the trash. RAIN: There's Sean. I think he's got a crush on you. Yes, well that won't last long after he finds out how nutso I am. [BOYS CHATTERING] Oh, some day I'll give you the gory details. Hi, there. Hey, Tess, um, I spilled my lunch all over my notes. Can I borrow yours, please? BOY 1: Check it out. Check it out. BOY 2: Whoa! [STUDENTS EXCLAIMING] See you, Sean. And sure, you can borrow my notes anytime. JACK: When Carol and I first got together, we couldn't keep our hands off each other. I remember those days. Well, I guess it happens to everyone, you get older and you start worrying about money and houses and kids, and the sex life winds down. There was something else. She was disappointed in me. I never set the world on fire, you know, with work. Never found anything better for myself. That sounds so simple, it felt like an excuse, but, but... That was part of it. [SIGHS] It's complicated. The year before last, I was laid off. Carol went to work for her mother. Oh, man. Nothing was going right. [SIGHS] Carol and I were barely speaking to each other. Suddenly, it felt like there was no floor under my feet. MALE THERAPIST: You felt powerless. And you needed some control over your life. Control, yeah. Never thought about it like that before. Carol was so... Unapproachable. But yeah. I could control Tess. She was... Helpless? I guess that's it. Helpless. You have got to see this. Oh, that is so pretty. That will look wonderful on her. Cindy picked it out herself. This is her first date, right? Well, it is. Of course, Bob is fit to be tied. I guess it's just a big deal for all of us. Yeah. Well, how about you? Has Tess picked out a dress yet? Oh, she hasn't said anything. I don't think she's going to be going. Oh, yeah, she is. I mean Cindy said Tess is the talk of the school. She and Sean, somebody... She kissed him in front of everyone. Kissed him? Tess? Well, she didn't say anything. I... I'll ask her about it. [SIGHS] I got to go. I got to take my mother to the eye doctor. Don't like to keep her waiting, you know. Bye. Hey, hey Carol, don't look so worried, okay? You just talk to her about it. Yeah. Bye. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR SHUTTING] All right. I'll be ready in just a few more minutes. Can you put your makeup on in the car? Dear, I have not put makeup on in a car in decades. It 'll probably end up in my ear. [CHUCKLES] You don't need makeup at the doctor's anyway. When you get to be my age, you wear makeup everywhere. Why haven't you ever had any pictures of daddy around? I have pictures of him, somewhere. It was a long time ago. How come you never remarried after he died? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Carol, where's all this coming from? I'm just curious. You know, you never talk about it. Well, my dear, that is the definition of personal. All right. You want to know why I never got married again. It wasn't that I couldn't have. I had a lot of suitors. But the truth is that I didn't want to be bothered. Bothered? Yes, bothered. I didn't want to take on another man. I didn't want to have to worry. "Is he happy? "Am I a good wife? "Are his clothes clean? His shoes shined?" I already had one child. Why take on another? I didn't realize I was such a burden. I mean I was in boarding school nearly year-round. I had to work to pay for the boarding school, to support us. No one ever gave me anything. Of course. [SIGHS] Okay. Let's go. Mom! It 's just me. It 's just me. I know, Daddy. I'm home almost two weeks, can you believe it? And you and I haven't talked yet. So, where's mom? Um, she left a message. She got hung up somewhere. Took her mom to the eye doctor. She'll be back soon. It's just you and me. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. Look, don't be nervous. It's okay. What a mess, huh? [SNICKERS] Yeah. I wish I could go back and undo everything. Start over again. It was wrong, I mean, look what it did. I'm sorry for my part in it. Do n't apologize. Sometimes I think... That's all the therapy does, it makes us say, "I'm sorry." "I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." And... Somehow we... We just don't get to the heart of it. You don't have to be sorry. I just never thought, um... Go on, say it. I just never thought that when I finally talked about it, that it would get this bad. I thought that somehow it could go back to the way it used to be. But... I don't know. It's just... I didn't know there was going to be social workers and therapists and... You moving out. I ... I didn't know. Honey, you did the right thing. There's something I've got to say. And ... I think you're maybe the only person who can understand this. As wrong as I was, I never meant to hurt you. I know, Dad. Do you? It means so much to hear you say that. I miss you so much. I just want to reach out and... And give you a hug, you know, just a hug like a father hugs a daughter. Daddy. Oh, honey, don't be scared. It's behind us. Don't be scared. Tess. Daddy! Hey, partner! Hi, Carol. I'm late. Tess and I were just talking. Okay. Carol, don't. We're just here in the kitchen. It's nothing. Will, go upstairs. No! Go upstairs! Mmm. He didn't do anything. Why do you look at me like that? I didn't do anything. T his is insane. I can't trust either one of you. God, get me out of here! You shouldn't have said that. It 's me you don't trust, not Tess. I don't trust anyone, especially myself. You know, you start firing accusations, it doesn't help any of us. You're no one to talk. Well, you know, maybe I am. You see I'm one guy who's got nothing to lose. We can't afford another incident. There was no incident here. Do you think that's why I came back? You got to meet me halfway, give us a chance. Tess. Go away. We've got to talk about this. Get out of my room. I just want to go to sleep. Not until this is cleared up. Would you look at me, please? Please, look at me. I said something down there that wasn't right. You don't trust me. I didn't mean it. It's just crazy. I didn't mean it. You think it was my fault. Honey, I'm doing the best I can here. Our lives have just been blown apart. It's no different than if someone lobbed a bomb through our front window. I t wasn't someone, it was Dad... And me. I know. I know you're hurting. I wish we could talk about things. I don't know how to talk to you. You're always so angry. Well, I don't know what's going on. Today, Cindy's mum tells me that you're going to the school dance, and you didn't say anything. I mean, I'm looking at Cindy's dress and I didn't even know you were going. So, who cares? So who cares about some stupid school dance? And she said that you kissed some boy at school, very publicly. Doesn't mean anything. Well, it should. I mean, it should mean something if you kiss someone. It doesn't. And aren't you the one who says not everything has to mean more than it does? You're taking what I say and, and turning it around. I don't know what to do, Tess. [SHOUTING] Tell me what to do! [SOBBING] I'm not the one who's supposed to know. [TESS SOBBING SOFTLY] No, you're right. [SOBBING] You're right. It's not your job. [SIGHS] You're right. You're right. [DOOR OPENING] [GIRL BREATHING HEAVILY] [DOOR CLOSES] M AN: [ECHOING] Please. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Well, they had a pretty good selection when Cindy and I were here. [BABY CRYING] I just hope they still have something in Tess' size. [BABY CRYING] Sorry. [LAUGHS] It's all right. It happens to everybody. [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] Can this go any slower? [BABY'S CRIES ECHO] MAN'S VOICE: [ECHOING] That's it, Tess. Carol, are you okay? [BREATHING HEAVILY] I can't breathe. [BABY CONTINUES CRYING] Let's just sit down. Take your time, there's no rush. [BABY'S CRIES ECHO] [INHALING DEEPLY] Carol, what's going on? Ah. [SUPPRESSING SOBS] Maybe I shouldn't have asked him to move back in. Oh. Oh, Carol. I keep thinking about him being gone. And not like gone, like this last year, but really gone with a divorce and settlement and custody. I know, I know. [BREATHING HEAVILY] These are such hard things. And money. Do we sell the house? Then what do we do? Well, wait a minute now. One thing at a time. Besides, you're working. Yeah, with my mother. That is so humiliating. I can't trust her to help with any of this. Well, then get another job. [LAUGHS] I mean... At least that would put some distance between you and your mother. Yeah, as if there weren't enough already. The only thing that's important is you. You and your family. [SIGHS] You're right. Okay, let's go get that dress for Tess... Before they sell out. [LAUGHS] I want to tell you about a dream I have been having. It's late at night and, uh, a man comes into a girl's bedroom, but it's Jack and Tess. And he... He sits down on the edge of the bed... And he starts to pull the covers back. [BREATHING HEAVILY] THERAPIST: Go on. He starts to touch her. THERAPIST: Are you in the room? Well... It's like I'm in the room, but I'm not. It 's like I want to say something, but I can't. I can't. You know, I think its Tess's room, but it... It doesn't look like Tess's room, the wallpaper or the... The furniture, the... Ah. Ah. [SIGHS] I had another panic attack yesterday. THERAPIST: Let's stay on the dream, Carol. Well, I've got to stop having these, you know, they just... They just debilitate me. I get... I just hate them, you know. M A N: [WHISPERING] Sweetheart. If I'm in the room, why can't I stop it? [SOBBING] TESS: You're rich. RAIN: My parents are rich. Wow. He buys and sells companies. I bet he doesn't care if they bloom. Nope, only cares if he makes money. I'm sure he's made a lot of that. So, where is everybody? Dad' s away on business a lot. Mom goes with him most of the time. So, uh... What's your real name? What do you mean? W ell... [LAUGHS] I mean if your parents were hippies, yeah, but these guys didn't name you Rain. [SIGHS] Victoria. [LAUGHING] Don't laugh or I swear I'll push you in the deep end. [LAUGHS] Okay, I told you my secret, now you tell me yours. You promised to tell me all the gory details. That bad, huh? Must be good. I'm not sure I want to talk about this. Now, I'm really curious. It has to do with sex, doesn't it? I guess so. Not sex, really. But almost. Anybody I know? Uh... It was my father. What? Freaky, huh? I lived. But, don't tell anyone, okay? I won't. Don't you want to kill him? No. Now I kind of feel bad for him, actually. So much for Barbie, huh? Okay. This is done. You can drop it off a building now if you want to. Well... I'm sure the shipping service would be happy to do just that for a fee. Um... I thought I'd leave early to go get Will. If you wish. W ell, you know with all the stuff that's going on, he could use a boost, you know. [SIGHS] Well, you go ahead and go. I'll be fine. Um, Mom? What house were we living in before Daddy died? On Elm Street. Don't you remember? No, I didn't. It's a blur, you know? School, couple of friends and zip, I was in college. But, I was thinking back and I couldn't remember. Well, I remember everything. We lived on Elm Street until about two years after your father died. Then Robin Hood Drive, and now I have my condo. Right. All right, well... See you tomorrow. You had the most beautiful bedroom on Elm Street. It had flowered wallpaper and a window right next to your bed, and the moonlight filtered in through your hair. You looked like an angel. I wish you'd said that to me then. I did, didn't I? Oh, well, it was so long ago. Who knows who said what to whom? See ya later. WILL: School was okay. C AROL: Mmm-hmm. [LAUGHS] Ben threw up. [LAUGHS] Sorry. Was it awful? Kinda. You know, my mind's been on a lot of stuff lately and... I wanted to take a minute and just say something to you. Like what? I love you. [LAUGHS] I know you don't hear me say that a lot, and I should, I mean to. But I know you love me. Well, that's not enough. You got to hear it, over and over again, so that someday it will be the easiest thing in the world for you to say it to somebody that you love. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Okay. [SIGHS] You look like a guy. CAROL: That's enough, Will. Tess, if you're going to be angry, then be angry at me. I'm not angry at anybody. It's just hair, for God's sake. No, it's not. It doesn't take a genius to figure out... Would you... It's enough, it's done. All you do is fight, I mean, I was happy when Dad came home, so why isn't anybody else happy? Honey. I just don't understand. GIRL: Check out Tess's hair. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GIRLS LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Tess? Wow, you got new hair. Still want me as your date? Yeah, yeah, I do. Look, you're a nice guy. You don't want to be with someone like me. But I didn't ask anybody else, I asked you. Hey, great haircut, Tess. Shut up, Leon. Why don't you kiss me, Tess? Hey, I said, get out of here. Come on, Tess. Don't waste your time with this guy. He wouldn't know what to do with you anyway. GIRL: [SHOUTING] Fight! [GRUNTING AND YELLING] [CROWD CHATTERING] TESS: Do I have to be in therapy for the rest of my life? THERAPIST: It's going to take some time to sort it out. TESS: What if something's wrong with me? I don't think I can change. Like what? Tess? I didn't tell him to stop. Talk to me about that. [SOBBING] It's hard 'cause... I'd never been with a boy. And, I had ideas what it would be like having someone touching you. But... What happened... It got to a point where, um... [VOICE BREAKING] I didn't tell him to stop. [SOBBING] I couldn't. THERAPIST: You became aroused. [CRYING] Yes. I 'm sick, aren't I? THERAPIST: No, you're not sick. You were 14 years old. All of a sudden you're confronted with something, something you never imagined. And you couldn't make sense of it. You were overwhelmed. [SOBBING] Can you hear me, Tess? MAN: Excuse me. Well, Jack, it's been some time. Vivian. Nice of you to stop by. Are those for me? [SIGHS] Ah. Wooing the wife? I just thought I'd stop by. Thought I'd bring these. Oh, flowers. Um, why don't I take these, and I'll go put them in a vase for you. Hello. Hi. I had a break from work. I... I just wanted to see you. And? And that's it, I just wanted to see you. You got five minutes? Uh-huh. Won't they miss you at work? They might. Don't care. Full-court press, huh? Well, it worked once, a long time ago. Open up, just a little. The flowers were sweet. Well, that's a start. Small beginnings lead to bigger and better things. Okay, the, uh... The first time I thought you might be a man I'd marry, you were standing on my front porch with a bird-of-paradise in your hand. [LAUGHS] I chopped it down. I took it out of your neighbor's yard. What was her name? Mrs. Gabbins? Gaskins, she was horrible. Gaskins, yeah. Didn't she catch you? She scared the hell out of me. [LAUGHS] I've gone to flower shops ever since. See, I learned never to make the same mistake twice. I know what you're saying. Do you? Uh-huh. I hope so. I still love you, do you know that? And I'd do anything to get us back on track. [SIGHS] I miss you. I'm still here. Look, let me take you out to dinner this week, like a date. Let's see if we can find a way out of this. Well, I think we are... You know, things are getting better, slowly. CAROL: Well, we're trying to move ahead. Yeah. Jack and I, um, we had a nice afternoon a couple of days ago. He came to the gallery and we took a walk, just the two of us, um... Talked about how we used to be. Mmm-hmm. He brought me flowers. [LAUGHS] We 're going to dinner soon, like a date. Like we used to before the kids. Mmm-hmm. Tess, how do you feel about your parents reconciling? I, I hope they're happy. I think it'll be good for everybody. Sometimes, the person in your position doesn't feel that way. That would be kind of selfish, wouldn't it? Okay. But you'll be open with me if you have feelings about that. Sure. Great. Well, that's it for today. Okay. We'll see you next week. Certainly. Take care, Tess. Wow. I'm happy you're all settling in. I like to see families stay together if they can. Thank you, bye-bye. Thank you. Wow, that went well. What do you think? Tess? What a great session. Too bad, everybody can't have a social worker come to their house once a week. Hey, wait a minute. Don't! I don't have to play this game when she's gone, don't come near me. This isn't fair. Do you know all I have to do is scream? That's all I have to do, so don't come near me, either one of you. [SCOFFS] Carol, let her go. [DOOR CLOSES] Get out! I'm not going anywhere. I don't care what happened, you do not rule the roost around here. I'll scream. Go ahead. We talked about him coming back. We talked about this being a chance for all of us. Now, you were part of that decision. [SHOUTING] What do you want from me? I don't want to be alone. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. Then you talk to him. I am, but you don't have to make it harder than it has to be. Hasn't everyone done enough damage around here? Everyone? You mean me? I'm the one you hate. Hey, I have tried to protect you every step of the way. You're too late. Three times it happened. How long would it have gone on if I hadn't walked in on you? [SCREAMING] No, stop! [SOBBING LOUDLY] [SOBBING] She was so angry, she frightened me. There's a voice in me that says she's ruined everything. But how could I think that? I mean, how could I even say that? THERAPIST: Your own mother didn't teach you. It's hard for you to know. How can I be the mother I want to be? By doing, by loving, by not leaving Tess alone the way your mother left you. My mother was never there for me. But you never stopped trying, Carol. How long until you realize it's impossible? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Oh, all right. What was that about? Nothing. What, you were talking, and I came over and now it's about nothing? A little paranoid? I shouldn't have told you anything. Tess, do you think I'm crazy? Tess, I didn't say anything! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Still wearing your ring? Yeah. I never took it off, even through all this. Me neither. Maybe that says something. It 's hard to give you up. Then listen to that. I am. I'm trying. W AITER: Here you are, sir. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, is this where we say goodnight? Come lie down with me? Oh, Carol. [LAUGHS] Wait. [DOOR OPENING] Um... What? M AN: Please. I 'm sorry. What is it? I don't know, I just can't. Okay. I understand. I'm sorry, too. I'll be downstairs. Carol, I loved this evening. So did I. [DOOR CLOSES] Daddy. [WHISPERS] No! Carol, what are you doing here? Sorry, I didn't call first. Well, I have to go out, I mean what is it? You seem so upset. I want to see a picture of Dad. I don't understand. I want to see a picture of my father. What is there to understand? Very well. Carol, what is bringing all this about? Well, that would take quite an explanation. When he died, everything of his was taken away, his clothes, photos, why? Because I didn't want to keep painful memories around, reminders. What is it that you want, Carol? I want the truth about my father. What kind of truth? I had a dream. I think it was a memory. I'm afraid it was. What, what kind of dream? Did he come into my room at night? Of course he came to your room at night. He was your father... Late at night, did he touch me? Did he molest me, Mother? What are you talking about? It happens, it happened to Tess. I want to know if it happened to me! Oh, my God, Tess and Jack. This is disgusting. I can't comprehend to his. Just tell me! Tell you what? I don't know. How on Earth would I know? [SHOUTING] You were my mother! Well, I wasn't in the room or wherever you say this happened. No, you were never there. You accuse me? Where were you when your so-called husband was taking liberties with your daughter? Oh, God. Oh, God. I have to go out. [STIFLES SOB] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Oh! God, it just keeps flooding back. And I couldn't remember, you know. I just buried everything. THERAPIST: Because it was so horrible. Blocking it is a way to cope. And how could my mother not know? THERAPIST: Well... That's what Tess says about me, isn't it? And I didn't know! [SOBBING] I let my girl down. Oh, I love her so much. I have to do better for Tess. I have to. What kind is it? Olive. It'll be a nice shade tree someday. Yeah, 10 or 15 years. Wonder where we'll be then. Well, see I was hoping we'd be right here, you and me, our aches and pains, sitting under an olive tree. I bought it as an act of faith. I guess I needed to do that. I understand. That's what marriage is, isn't it? An act of faith? You plant something and you hope that it grows. Wish it were as easy as it sounds. I can hear it in your voice, in your words. "I," "me..." It ' s hard for you to even say the word "we." It's hard for you too, isn't it? It's hard for us to know how to love each other. I am so sorry for what happened to you as a boy. Then you showed up. So beautiful. I know I didn't deserve you. I never deserved you, but... Somehow, in some crazy way you... You loved me, too. We rescued each other. Rescued you? Carol, I never thought of it like that. That's what you did. When I was a girl, my father molested me. I know that now. Carol. So, we're not that different, you and I. My God, Carol, what? This whole thing, it's like a curse, that's what's tied us together. Well, we rescued each other once. Why can't we do it again? God, what a beautiful day. Sun on the back of your neck. What a day to plant a tree. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hi. Oh, you must be Sean! You look real handsome. Thanks. Is Tess here? Yeah. One minute. Hey. I'm Sean. I know. Nice to meet you. It's a little chilly tonight. I could give you both a ride. Uh, no, we'll walk, thanks. WILL: Guys, you should see her! She looks pretty! Even with her stupid haircut. CAROL: Tess. Wow. You look great, Tess. So do you. Shall we? Oh, I almost forgot. Uh, this is for you. It 's pretty. It even matches my dress. Good, I guessed right. Put it on. Yeah? I don't want to stick you. TESS: You won't. Well done. Ready? And you'll be home when? I'll be fine, dad. Don't worry about me. Okay, goodbye, darling. Mom, we're going to be late. Goodbye. Have fun. I want her happy. Yeah. This is better. So hot in there. It ' s cloudy out. There's barely a star in the sky. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND] You know I never know what to think with you. One day, you just come up and kiss me, and now we're here, and you seem a million miles away. The other day when you and Rain were talking, was it about me? No. Sure it was. I could see it in your faces. Look, it wasn't anything bad. But you don't want to talk about it, do you? Oh, to hell with it, who wants to talk about it? You know, you don't do that like you like it. I don't understand. But you must like it? Be honest. Sure, it's great. You've never had sex before, have you? What kind of question is that? Because if you had, we wouldn't be here standing here talking about it. Okay, okay. So let's go somewhere. All right, if that's want to do, I'm not going to say no. Let's see who's talking now. What did Rain tell you? She told me to be sure to buy you a corsage. She thought you'd like it. Tess? [WEEPING] Honey, are you okay? No. Well, what happened? Why aren't you at the dance? I don't belong there. Of course you do. What are you talking about? I'm not like anybody else. I feel like the inside of me has turned to stone. Oh, Tess, honey, you... You're only 15, you have everything ahead of you. I'm a survivor. That's what they call people like me. Survivors. They try to make it sound so proud... [SOBBING] I just keep thinking keep thinking of it like being washed up on a shore, half-dead. Oh, Tess. I'm so sorry. I never meant that for you. What I did was so wrong. I came home so that things could heal. I... I wanted to see you be a kid again. I wanted to love you as my daughter again. But things are so broken, I just don't know what to do. Mom! Mama? Jack, she's scared. Jack. I think it's best that I leave. I don't want to, but I think it's best. Thank you. I'm sorry. So am I. Oh, baby. So much of this is my fault. [VOICE BREAKING] It's not your fault, it's my fault. I am the one who let him do it. No. No, I haven't been honest with you, honey. I 've let you carry too much. I let you feel responsible, I 've been jealous and angry, and I have to learn to put my anger in the right place and it is not at you. All I had to do, was tell him no. I still don't know why I didn't tell him. He's your father. You trust him. That's why betrayal is so devastating. It's easier to push the truth away than it is to push your father away. I understand that now. And it is not a weakness. Denial is what we do to cope. That is what we do to hang on, but it's also the thing that makes you feel so alone. And so guilty. Your father will be leaving soon. Mom, I don't want you to be alone. That's not your worry. And, you know, this is the way it has to be. He knows that. We mourn the things we lose, and then we go on. It's going to be okay. I promise you, we'll be all right. [SOBBING] I love you so much, honey. I love you. I guess that's it. Oh, Will. I'll be thinking about you, Will. I'll see you next week. I won't be far. I love you so much. I love you too, daddy. Take it. Oh, no, honey, that's yours, you keep it. Dad, I want you to have it. Take it. Keep it for me. Thank you. I love you. I love all of you. [CAR DOOR SHUTS] [ENGINE STARTING] I feel so sad. Daddy will be fine. All of us will be fine. It's okay. I sold the house. Lot of memories in that house. And Tess put on a pair of skates the other day. I have been thinking about going back to school, you know. Maybe I'll teach. That would be good. I had to try for us all to be together again, you know. It didn't work, but that's okay, you know? We will go on. If we keep secrets, you know, even from ourselves, we are doomed to live them out over and over again, you know? But we have choices. THERAPIST: It's a big job. But a gift, really, you know? Finally. For me, and Will, and Tess.
