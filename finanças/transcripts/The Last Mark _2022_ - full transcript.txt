It's the Thompson Symphony Orchestra and it's very soothing. I'm losing my mind out here. How much longer? See, Keele, you could use a little symphony in your life, my friend. What has she told you? Well, we're not conversing at the moment. She's called me an asshole and also a pervert. So you get her to talk, right? Maybe she tells you what you need to know, end of story. And how do I do that? Isn't that what you do? No, for some reason, I don't actually get to know the people I murder, ya fuckin' moron. Look, it's special circumstances. Now look, I hate to be the one to tell you this but, um, yeah, it's your new friend who's lookin' for ya, so just prepare yourself. That was quick. Well then you just better hurry up, okay?

Good morning! Listen, none of this shit from earlier, all right? I forgive you. Eggs coming through, here. Okay. Sorry there's no cutlery. You know why. And there's no toaster here so don't even ask. I guess that's what they call roughin' it, huh? Okay, look, we got off to a bad start. But I'm feeding you now, aren't I? You're quite the little fighter though. Give you that. So I got some coffee, you want some coffee? Look, the sooner you start talking, the better things will be. All right. Well, this was nice! Help! You ready to talk? I want coffee. Now you want coffee?

No. You don't know how you got that huge scar on your neck? If I untie ya, you gonna throw the nuclear coffee at me? 'Cause I'll put you right back in that room. Stop looking at my scar. Why am I here? We're hiding out. Where's the other guy? That's who we're hiding out from. I thought you wanted to kill me. If I wanted you dead, I'd get my silencer, take you in the woods and- Then why am I here? I need to ask you some questions. About what? Who are you? Peyton Sallow. Yeah, I know that. Then why'd you ask? Just tell me somethin'. About yourself, you know, just somethin'. My name is Peyton Sallow. I saw you kill a guy, what else do you wanna know? Christ, no, I mean, like where you from, just- Detroit. Where'd you grow up? Detroit. And what about your mom, or your dad? What about them? I don't know, just somethin'. What are their names? Why, so you can kill them? Can you just please work with me here? I really wanna get out of this shit house sometime in the near future. So leave then! You're making me stay. No I'm not! Yeah, the fact that you exist is making me stay, okay? Okay. Okay, Jesus, what's with all the attitude? You're freaking me out, okay?! I'm freaking you out? Yeah. Me just talkin' to you is freaking you out? Yeah! Okay, well then, I'm gonna freak out too. Let's all freak out! I'm gonna freak out, yup. Freakin' out, ohhhh! Jesus. I don't need this shit. You've got a problem. Yeah, and you're a hooker tied to a chair, so. I'm a call girl, there's a difference. Yeah, not much. You're judging me? You cut off people's heads. I do not cut off people's heads, that's the other guy. Yeah, well, you're still a murderer. And you rent yourself out by the hour! And you don't? Oh, stop crying. Will you just, can you just stop, please? I can't breathe. Stop crying. Put the glass down. That's it, you're going back in the room. No. Yeah. You had your chance and you blew it. I promise I won't do it again. - Uh-huh. - You can trust me. Yeah, I don't think so. Fine, you wanna know about me? About this? I was nine. Like usual, there's a new guy over. And he's drunk. I walked into the kitchen and I guess he didn't like me drinking his orange juice. He had a ring on, so. That other guy who chops people's heads off, he wants to kill you. So if you run from here, he'll do anything to find you. I'm the only thing between you and him. You got it? Okay. You can't walk around in that. What's wrong with this? You might be more comfortable in these. Bathroom's upstairs. You guy with the complaint? And the grey van? Another one? Yeah, I got assigned to your case. So, you must be special. Okay, I'm not just some guy with a complaint, okay? I'm Doug. Assistant Manager. You sound special, Doug. Talk to the other cops. I don't got all day. You bandage that yourself? This? Yeah. Well, it's a little dramatic. Well, it hurts, a lot, so. A customer might find that off-putting. They might think that a crime happened here and then they might decide to take their business elsewhere. And I'm sure that my presence isn't helping. You got a question about these guys or what? Guys? Like I told yous before, there's two guys in a car. One of them didn't pay his bill so I approached the vehicle. Did you get a licence plate on the other vehicle? Again, it's 551UF, I fucking forget the last two. But it was a-is a black muscle car. Real nice car. This one of the guys? Yeah. Yeah, that's the fuckin' asshole right there, yeah. Ah, the other guy, can you describe him? Real Jewy, man. I don't know what else to fuckin' tell ya. Again, you guys have gotta get your heads together, man. The crime in this town is going through the, through the fuckin' roof, okay? Do your job. Do your job. Yeah. Ah, thank you for your tips. Um, listen. Do you mind following me back to my vehicle? I've got some headshots I'd like you to review. You couldn't-you couldn't have fuckin', oh god. Make it quick, okay, I don't got all day. It'll only take a second. Hello? Hello? Hello? Got you. Hello? Baby, who is it? No one, babes. Feel better? Huh? The clothes. Come sit in here. What are those pills for? Bunch of things. You ever try breathing? Yeah. Yeah, I try breathing. No like four, seven, eight? When you're stressed out you close your eyes, count in for four. Hold for seven. Then you go out for eight. Until you feel better. Try it. That's some real hippy crap right there. No, it's not. It's an actual medical thing. I promise it works, just try it. Come on. It'll make you feel better. Nope, don't feel any better. Does that make you calm? Mmm hmm. So is what you said about that other guy true? Yeah, it's true. His name's Palmer. So what's the plan? Are you gonna turn him in? No, with these people, there's always another guy. So what are we gonna do? There's only two ways out. Listen, gotta tell you something. I'm taking you to Argentina. What? Yeah, I thought I'd-I'd take you somewhere that you're gonna like. That's my stuff! Yeah, it's not embarrassing. See this? That's personal! So what? Do you know how much shit I usually collect on my marks? That's fuck all. And how 'bout little bit of fucking gratitude here, huh? I am not going. You don't have a choice! Hey! Give her back. No. Oh, I'm sorry, did you want this? Oh, what are you gonna do with that now, huh? Hey. Hey, what are you doing? Don't, don't. No! Get back here! Peyton! Peyton, stop, hey! HELP! I hate you! Whoa. Palmer. Swanky. Why don't you just knock like a normal person here? What-what's-what's going on? What's with the badge? Oh, you like it? So did the gas station guy on 24? Said he saw you there with Keele. Yeah. Yeah, see, a man approaches me wanting a service as long as he's willing to pay for that service, then I abide. Well, now I'm in need of your service. Where is he? I don't know. Man, he fucked with my business and I don't like the way that feels. Hey, what are you- Hey! Come on, man, what are you doing? Do you have any idea how expensive that is? What was that? Oh, shit, honey- Oh my god. - It's okay, everything- Hello. Please, honey, honey, honey, it's a misunderstanding. I got it under control. No, no, no, no, no, no, this is an infringement on our civil liberties. Can you please go back in your bedroom, go back- No, take out your phone and tape him! Ma'am, would you kindly shut the fuck up? - Okay, okay, all right. - Fuck! - Jesus, fuck! - Easy man, easy! Look, look, I got this under control. Leave her alone, okay? She doesn't know anything about anything. She doesn't know about you? No, no, well, no. Nothing, nothing, nothing important and not that- Nothing important? You know what your husband does? Yeah, he imports cheese. - I import cheese. - "He imports cheese." No, he's a fixer. That's a criminal. He's aiding a murderer right now. - What? Why are you saying this? - What is he saying? You should be honest with your bride before you die! Here, look, look, I'll start, I'll start. Well, I'm not a real cop. Oh! It looks pretty good though, right? Okay, all right. Okay, Keele- - Explain, yeah. - Keele. - Come on, let's go. - Keele. - Come on! Keele's got two hundred K on him, okay? Oh, fuck you, man. Okay?

You made a promise. You made a vow! A little hubbah. - Yeah, I remember. - Yeah. You know I'm gonna need to do something about that. Okay, please don't, please. Okay, what do you wanna know? Does he know I'm coming? Yes. Why'd he take her? That's too bad. Find out right before she dies. Wait, wait, you- You're gonna break the guy's heart right before you kill him? That's life. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is he? Come on. You've reached Eli's Fine Cheeses. I can't get to the phone right- Is it any better? No. The van's toast, and you'd be too if you tripped that wire. Well, sorry. Look, I wasn't trying to shoot ya. Well, I know that now. Oof. That's gonna need something. You got a fever? You thought I was gonna kill ya, right? Here you are alive. I let you out, I showed you the plan. I mean, what's it gonna take? For what? For you to trust me. What's your name? It's James. And what's your last name, James? Uh... That's what I thought. It's for your own good you don't know my name, okay? Will you just tell me why I'm here? I knew your mother. How? Well, we met after I was discharged. It was a long time ago. Did you know that she died? No. I mean, we tried to make it work, you know? But it was complicated. Are you saying you slept with my mother? No, it was... It was more than that, Peyton. What do you mean? I mean, I can't be sure, but... No. It's not you. So then you know who your dad is? Do you? Well, I got a friend looking into it, so. She said he was a good man. It's not you. Well, either way, we're going to Argentina. Whoa, whoa, buddy, buddy! It's me, it's just me! What are you doing here? It's been a long day, okay? Please, please. - Peyton. - What? It's okay. Hey, sorry about that, yeah, with the- Um, I'm Eli. Nice to- I got what you wanted. - Come in. - Yeah. You stay here. You don't move. I mean it. Swanson hasn't made good contact with the ball, and is just at the- What the hell happened to your face? What, oh, Palmer, that's what. Yeah, he, uh, somehow he found the gas guy. He came to my house but I gave him an address in Hillsdale. Are you sure you're not followed? There's no way, there's no way. It was too long of a ride, I would've-I would've made him for sure. That's one guy you don't want on your tail. You're positive, right? 'Cause we're sittin' ducks here. Yes. Yes, let's get this done, okay? Let's, you can fly the coop for good this time and get outta here. I wanna get outta this shithole. Yeah, no kidding, this is- this is a safe house? Yeah, I-I grossly overpaid for this. Trucking? Trucking, huh? Yeah, no, I- I can see that.

Well, that's understandable. And the girl's a handful, so. On a tear, zero- She's a good-looking kid. - Hey! - What? Take it easy. Here. What? It's for the other passport. So, uh, so you decided. Mmm hmm. So, you-you're not even gonna ask me? Doesn't matter now. You can't be serious, man, you- you put all of our lives on the line, for-for-for what then? For what? For what you just put in your pocket. Okay, no, you should know- I should know what? Drop it! Okay, let's go. No, okay, well, fuck it, fuck it. Congratulations. You're not a father. Whoa, hey, buddy, buddy! I said don't tell me! Hey, what is happening here right now? I thought that was a good thing! Jesus. Forget about the girl, get outta here. Make this a happy ending. I'm taking her. Fine. Fine, whatever. Just don't understand why, why you're so attached to somebody else's kid. We're not attached. She hates me. What's going on? Who is that guy? He's an old friend. We're going with him. Put this on your forehead. Why? 'Cause you're not well. Just do it. Stop! I can see your fever from here, please. Unbelievable. After Sanku's record-breaking night, Donald Swanson- So we can't leave from Detroit because there's too much heat on us. Fine, fine, I'll get you as far as Clarkson and then you guys are on your own from there, okay? No, first we need to go by a drugstore. But- - I'm fine. You're not! We also need a car in Clarkson. Right, right, okay. I'm gonna hook you up with a car in Clarkson right now and let's go, we'll go right now, okay? How much? No, preferred client discount. How much you want?

Couple warmup pitches as Derrick Graham- Did you set me up? After all I've done for you. After all we've been through together, you're not- Are you really asking me that question? You've never done a favour in your life. Okay. Don't move. No, no. Oh, fuck, Eli. You could've got out. You had a chance to get out and you didn't go and that's on you, man, that's on you! Okay, why did you get me involved in this in the first place? You pulled me into this! I was getting a good clean business going on my own. You were never clean in your life, Eli. Cleanish, cleanish! You weren't there, okay, you didn't see him. You didn't see him, this guy was crazy. This guy's crazy! And not-not-not regular crazy, it's like calm crazy. It's like the worst kind of crazy. How much does he know? He knows everything, man. He knows everything, all right? He knows about the stash, he knows about the girl and your passports. And-and-and he's waiting out there and I'm supposed to walk you out. I'm supposed to walk you out and then he's gonna finish you off but there's two of us and there's one of him. There's only one of him, and if we work together, if we work together on this, we can get outta here. Hey, man, it wasn't for nothing, it wasn't for nothing, okay? He was gonna kill Myra, gonna kill her, okay? And then-then-then-then, what am I supposed to do? You woulda done the same thing, you woulda done the same, what are you gonna kill me? Come on, man. You gonna kill me, Keele? You gonna kill me? You're not gonna kill me. You're not an asshole, are you? I'm not an asshole. I'm sorry, man, okay? I'm sorry too.

But, but I don't know how to use it! There's nothing to it. You just point it where you want the bullet to go. All right? You ready? No! You fucked up, old man. You had one job! AH! All right, take this! You're gonna get in the car- What? No. - And you're gonna go. - No! - Yes. No, I can't, I don't know what I'm doing. Yes, you're gonna go right now. - I don't know what I'm doing. - It's not me, okay? What? Eli told me. Fuck you! Think about getting out of here right now and that's it, now let's move! Nowhere to hide, Keele! Look at me! It okay. Go, go! All right. Come get me, you fuckin' psycho! Don't move. Yeah, I learned all your tricks. What a waste. You didn't learn this one, you little prick. Ah, not bad. I can't wait to get acquainted with your girl. I'll be able to use this to chop her fuckin' head off. Rest easy, old man. I'll take good care of her. Oh, shit, you bitch! So you're his girl? Shut up! Hey, Peyton. You don't wanna do that. Peyton. Listen to me, okay? You can't undo it. He gets what he deserves.

Are you sure? Well, maybe a little help. So, James, how do we get to Argentina? Now you wanna go? Of course. I've always wanted to go to Argentina. You said you didn't. Well, I didn't want to go with you. You do now? Yeah. But I still hate you. I know. What about Alaska? I hear it's peaceful and- You just promised Argentina. All right, forget it. You know how to drive, right? Ahhhh, yeah. Holy Jesus. Ugh, this music.
