How's it going in there? That last one was really, really pretty. Okay, guys. I really like this one. Yes! Okay, I'm excited. Well, hurry up. Don't keep us waiting. Wow, that's great. It's classic, stylish, sexy. It's totally you. Are you excited? She hasn't come out yet. Huh? Oh. Oh. Oh, Charlotte. God, you look so beautiful. You look like a bride. It's perfect. This is it. This is the one. You said that about all of them. Yeah, I know. Do you like it? - I love the shape. - Mm-hmm. And I can move in it so easily. Yeah, it's-it's perfect. But it's not me. I'm sorry. Okay. That's okay. - We can try on some more. - Throw it in the pile. I'm never gonna find it. What? You still have another week to find a dress. And you know if you don't, I'd marry you in a T-shirt at city hall, okay. I was talking about the song, not the dress. - Right. - Thanks for reminding me. Yup. You're welcome. And in my free time I have to have a bachelorette party and survive my family coming into town. Don't forget, you also need to squeeze in our wedding in there. Are we, like, a 100% on the whole wedding thing 'cause the T-shirt and the city hall thing sounds pretty nice. I bet it does, but no, we are sticking to the plan. I really wanna meet your family. Oh, when you meet them, you'll be glad that you waited. Oh, yeah? But seriously Miss Giant Country Music Star is not gonna wait much longer for that song. Hm. She's been texting you again? And calling about a 100 times a day, so... Well, how about this? You let me handle the texting diva because it is my job as your publisher and as your strapping fiance. Well, at least one of us has confidence in me. Not only that. I have a secret weapon. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. You ready? ♪ Pum pum pum pum pum ♪ Pum pum pum ♪ What is it? - Pink lace. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Only the best. - Oh, is this my old notebook? - Mm-hmm. Where did you find it? Well, you remember when we moved in and you claimed that you were too lazy to unpack any of our boxes? - Unh-unh. No. - You don't? That's because I unpacked all of them and I found that. I wrote all of my first songs in here. Mm-hmm. I know. That's why I had it rebound. I added a few blank pages. You have a lot of good stuff in there. Figured it might give you some inspiration. Thank you. Just remember, I'm here to provide you sustenance and to protect your creativity. And to pitch my songs. Yeah, and to have babies. - Okay. - One day. - Uh-huh. - Yes. Like you. Yeah, you and me I was thinking unless you had some other idea. Oh, you know what? I think there's a problem. - What is that? - I think I'm too happy. I gotta tell you that's, that's some bummer news. Um... - I know. - What should we do about that? Hush, I don't know. Happy people don't really write good music. They don't. When I wrote "Too Good For You," I wasn't happy. - Not happy. Yeah. - Unh-unh. I think I need a good break-up. I think I don't like where this is going at all. Like just for a little while. No song is worth that. I will say though, you have a point. I mean, "Too Good For You" was a hit and it really solved your dress problem. Wedding dresses should be outlawed. Outlaw clothes entirely. Just get rid of 'em. Wait, you look a little goofy in my apron. I do? I thought it looked great. Good news, Napa is full of dress shops. Better news, Napa is also full of wine. So I think that this is gonna be a good fit. I don't know what's wrong with me. Every time I find a dress I like I find something wrong with it. Well, there's nothing wrong with wanting everything to be perfect. You know, I think I'm just comparing them all to my mom's wedding dress. I used to secretly try it on when I was little. It had the most beautiful lace and the longest, prettiest train you have ever seen. It was magical. I used to go through the entire ceremony right there in the attic. From the walk down the aisle to the first dance. The way the light reflected off of it it was breathtaking. Does your grandmother still have it? She's never thrown anything away. Well, then it sounds to me like this dress problem has been solved. You clearly haven't spent any time with her. - Call her. - Bye. No way. You could spill on it. You could rip it, might get all full of cigarette smoke. - I don't smoke. - Fine. Smog, whatever's in the air in that filthy city you live in. Hey, Charlie, baby, I am so sorry. I'm not gonna be able to make your bachelorette party. Your great-aunt says hello. Yeah, I heard her. Demure as ever. Of course, I don't know why your generation feels like they have to act like a bunch of floozies before their wedding day. - In my day, we did... - We're going to a wine tasting. It's civilized. Rose, it would really mean so much to me if you would let me wear it at my wedding. I started sewin' that dress the day your mama met your daddy. As I recall, I tried to teach you how to sew but you didn't really take to it. You can't really expect me to have sewn my own wedding dress. Babs sewed her wedding dress. I sewed all four of my wedding dresses. And-and you know what, Charlie? I actually sewed an extra one just in case something unexpected happened. I'm sure mama wouldn't mind. Well, she's not here now, is she? Look, I am not gonna box this dress up and send it through the United States socialist postal service. And then she went on for half an hour about how zip codes are a plot by the UN to turn us all into numbers. Oh, my. Well, I can't imagine my grandma sewing a dress. Well, my grandmother would sew me a nice doctor if she thought it would work. I need this dress. It means a lot to me. - Well, then take it. - What? Take the damn dress. You have as much of a right to it as she does. Uh, better idea, let's just go to Napa and have a few glasses of wine and forget that this whole dress problem even exists. You know, I like the way Laila thinks. I won't be able to enjoy it. That's why they serve wine. Trust me, the formula is tried and true. I think if I could just try the dress on my grandmother would change her mind. Then let's take her to Napa. I have a worse idea. Wait, hold on. What idea are we talking about? What if I told you about a different bachelorette destination with wine makers in farm-to-table restaurants and rustic charm? Well, I thought you hated it there. - We are not going. - Hate is a strong word. I just prefer not to be there. Yeah, I prefer to be in Napa, so... It could be an adventure. I mean, we could make it work. Rolling hills, no traffic. Ladies, this is a terrible idea. And speaking of terrible ideas, Chase is here. So she's in, right? - Hi, baby. - Hey, babe. Mm. Mm. I missed you. Oh. That's cute. Yeah, scotch on the rocks. - Make it expensive. - Yeah. Same thing for her, actually. Thanks. So? Yeah, just, uh, just wait. Well, get it, get it, get it, get it! Yes! Oh, that's $400 on that game. - Alright. Thank you. - Thank you. Drink up. Honey, I can't have too much to drink tonight. I have to go back to the office. - You work too hard. - Nonsense. I am the new top billing associate and I plan on staying that way. Well, how about we count tonight as a night off? - Hm? - I finished the brief for you. - Hm. You did what? - Yeah, no. I mean, I looked at it, looked great so I just sent it on up the ladder. Oh. Oh, okay. Well, you, you didn't CC me on that. Well, you're junior associate so I mean, it's a little above your pay grade. - Right, but I did the work. - Well, we. I mean, it's... You know, we're a team, we work as a team. Okay. Well, on my team, I wrote the damn thing. Okay. Just calm down. How about we just have a drink for a job well done? Okay? Alright? Mm. You'll love this. I've got some great feedback. "Great job, Chase." Uh, "We don't know how you did it, Chase." That's because I did it. Do you want me to say the new girl did it? Well, I'm an adult with a mortgage and a law degree so I'd prefer woman to girl, but yeah. Okay. Okay. Listen, how about we get out of here? I'll get a hotel room, I'll give you a massage, nice, warm... I'm just really not in the mood, Chase. Okay? 'Kay. Um... Oh, God, what... Uh, time. I'm crazy sometimes. Uh, I actually have to take a rain check. Totally forgot, I actually have to be home early tonight. The girlfriend and I are going to the Yucatan to celebrate her birthday. - Girlfriend? - Yeah, no, no, you were fan... - Oh, Chase. - You just... Oh. Charlotte, I'm in. I need to get as far away from here as possible. I love bar guys. Please tell me that was the last plane to train to plane to train that we have to take. Yup. Welcome to Harmony. Home sweet home. Great. Where is the rental car place? This is for you. Oh, my gosh. Okay, we're gonna get you some coffee. Guys, I need a glass of wine. - No. You need... - No, we need wine. - Red wine. - Where is the rental car guys? Slow your roll, drunkie. Things don't move as fast out here. You... You, go get your lazy butt fuel-sniffin' airport man to get our car, please. - That was really nice, okay? - No, it wasn't. - You're so drunk. - He's gone to get him. - I have rewards. - How can I help you, ladies? Oh, my gosh, Kathleen. Hi. She wasn't referring to you. She's sorry. Do I qualify for an upgrade? I have miles. - I have, I have miles. - Yeah, vodka miles. Um, can we get a car? So what's on the agenda? Well, we already have a truck, we just need to find a lake and go park by it and get in the truck bed and start drinkin' some beer like a true Southerner. That sounds like the first ten minutes of a horror movie. Look, we're gonna have so much fun. This is gonna be great. We're gonna eat biscuits and gravy and drink mimosas, ride horses and relax. And we may even find a nice, little Southern boy to sweep Kathleen off her feet. Ha! I'm not a nice boy kinda girl, okay? If you know any lying, cheating creeps 'cause that's apparently my kind of guy. You know, it really is breathtaking out here. It is, isn't it? How did this even happen? I can't remember the last time I ran out of gas. You drive an electric car. That would explain it. Look, I'm just gonna get an Uber, okay. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna work out too well. So, looks like our driver's name is Hugo. He's in a Kia Optima and... he'll be here in 11 hours and 23 minutes. Is there another car-sharing service out here for, like, tractors or horses or something? Yeah, it's called hitchhikin'. It's kind of like Uber, but for thumbs. What are you doing? - I'm getting us a ride home. - No. Charlotte, you're gonna get us killed. No, I'm not. This is a small town. Everybody knows everybody. We're fine. Great, so the serial killer that's gonna pick us up may have gone to high school with you. That's really comforting. Well, if you had just joined me in those Krav Maga classes. Well, well, then I'd be able to kick your ass for never shutting up about Krav Maga. If you guys don't quit arguin' I'm gonna make you slop the hogs when we get home. And you won't like it, trust me. Thank you. A person! We're saved! Oh, we got a guy! Either way, we're gonna get out of this. Hello. Where's he going? Whoo! Hi! Well, just for the record my opinion on the wisdom of hitchhiking has changed. They're really friendly out here. You guys remember Hank, right? - Hank? - Oh, my gosh. Little brother, Hank? The last time I saw you, you were like a pudgy little 16-year-old. Well, to be fair, Hank, that was seven years ago, so... Yeah, seven years. Seven long years. - Howdy, ladies? - Howdy? I mean hello, but that actually means the same thing. 'Sup? Okay, well, um, the sun has clearly gotten to them, so... We just need some gas. Thank you. Did you bring us wine? Gasoline. Thanks for picking us up. Yeah, of course. You know Rose. When you didn't show up, she started to worry. Always to the rescue. Only 'cause you're always in trouble. I swear, girl, I think it's my entire purpose in life to save you from poor decision-making and grandma's wrath. She let you call her grandma? Heck, no! I ain't that stupid. Oh, my gosh, do you remember the time I snuck out into the farm and stayed there all day to listen to the new Shania Twain album? Oh, my gosh, yeah. And you got so distracted you forgot to feed the sheep and you left the feed open. The pigeons ate half a can of grain. Rose was so mad at me. And then mama came to your rescue. "Let her sing, ma," she'd say. "The world needs music, and the Lord gave it to that child in spades." It paid off though, all that singin'. What are you, uh, what are you workin' on now, anyways? Well, honestly, I've been pretty stuck lately. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well... - You do write country music. - Mm-hmm. And you haven't been back home to the country in how long? Hank, I'm really sorry I haven't been home. I just, you know, after mom... Hey, it's alright. You're here now. That's all that matters. Look, thanks for droppin' everything comin' home, and taking care of Rose and the farm. - Yeah, of course. - Quite the job. You know, I did my city thing. This is where I belong. Not sure about your friends though. Okay, Kathleen, stop, stop. Oh, gosh! Charlie! Oh, look at you! You're so beautiful! - Hi, Babs. - Well, look what I... - Charlie? - Yeah. They add an I and a Y to everything around here. I am so honored to be hosting your bachelorette party. Oh, you're hosting! Great. Oh, it is the best part of gettin' married. Believe me. It's all downhill from here. Oh. Oh, well, look, you all must be Charlie's friends. I'm sure she has told you all about me. Uh, yes, of course. Not a word. Well, I'm Babs. Well, don't just stand there. Let's have a big ol' group hug. Come on! Welcome! Yay! Now, ladies, y'all are in luck. I have a big surprise. Babs knows how to throw a bachelorette party. - Come on, follow me. - Please help me. What is... Here, this will look better on you. - Whoo! - Now, ladies. I have started a business venture in the adult beverage market. Did you all know that a bottle of wine can sell for as much as $15, $20 a bottle? What? I mean, with prices like that how do you manage not to be sober? That is exactly why I planted my own vineyard right here on the farm. Wait. You guys grow grapes here? Grape wine is so, mm, stuffy. We do more apples, cherries, potatoes. Yeah. Isn't potato wine just vodka? Ha! I knew I recognized that taste from somewhere. Anyway, without further ado welcome to B and B Winery! What does the B stand for? - Babs, of course. - Right, but the other B. - Also Babs. - Babs and Babs Winery. - Got a nice ring to it. - Thank you. As you can see, I have provided an exquisite venue for all for your bachelorette party needs. Ho-ho-ho! Now first, we have this rose. Believe me, it's pink and you're gonna love it. We also have this dessert wine that I've made special in my bathtub. Now, the piece de resistance my special is red beer. Look at that. Add a little tomato juice and voila! I'll take the rose, but hold the tomato juice. Attagirl! Here you go. Oh! Thank you. And, Charlie, for you I made something special. Oh, wow! You gotta let it breathe a minute. Yes. Savor, savor the flavor. Mm. Mm-hmm. So, I see someone's off to a fast start. Grand... Rose! Hey. Um, these are my friends, Laila and Kathleen. Supper's ready unless you're plannin' on drinkin' your dinner. Can I just say I don't think you're gettin' that dress. Kathleen. Where are we? We're just a... speck in the whole universe. What? No. I mean, yeah, but, but... I mean, where are we? Third rock from the sun. You should know that. Laila, you're a doctor. Kathleen. - I'm not that kind of doctor. - Hm... So tell me, how is the great wedding dress caper coming? Rose seems to be going between being disappointed in me and being disappointed that she can't be disappointed in me, so... - So not that well, huh? - No. Well, I have some good news and some bad news. Okay, well, let's hear the bad news 'cause I don't think good news would even feel right right now. Uh, bad news is I spoke to everyone and they're really excited about the song. Well, how is that bad news? It's bad news because they're so excited they, they really want it by early next week. Babe, you're supposed to be getting me more time. I tried, Charlotte, I tried. Believe me. It's the music industry. Nobody delivers on time. Alright? Don't worry about it. Well, at least I have that going for me. So, is there actually good news? Yup, sure is. - What is it? - Mm. It is the fact that I love you. That's not news but I love you too. I've gotta go. My friends are hurting themselves. - I'll call you later. - Yeah. White rabbit! Where? The smoke. - What? - It makes the smoke go away. Have you even asked her yet? No. I'm waiting for the right time. That woman doesn't have a right time. Unh-unh. No, there are so many times you just have to dive in and take the cow by the horns. I think you mean bull. Cows don't have horns. - What was that? - Just a rebel yell. It gives you courage. You know what gives me courage? - Wine? - Yes. - Yes, but also pizza. - Ah! I would die for some pizza right now. Oh, I want pizza. - Stuffed crust with pepperoni. - Hm... We could do freaking, we could do the Canadian ham and the sausage and the... vegetables. Let's order a delivery. Oh, there's no pizza in town. What do you mean there is no pizza in town? Well, I mean, I think there's pizza a few towns over. Oh, well, I don't think that any of us are really in the condition to drive right now. Charlotte. I just had the best worst, best idea I ever had. You guys just, just stay right here, okay. Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. Don't move! I mean it. Ugh! Brown rabbit. - Brown rabbit. - It's white. - What? - The rabbit is white. Wha-whatever. You said brown. It's white. You can't just say any color rabbit. That's not how it works. You have to say white. - You say... - White rabbit! - Why does it work for you? - Because I said white. Uff. What? This is like every Thursday night in college rolled into one. Wait. Where did you even get this thing? Oh, it's one of Babs' Babsy business ventures. - Nothing wrong. - I miss college, guys. I used to be able to eat a whole pizza. And still fit in my pants the next day. Now I can't. I can't. Sir Charles, stop! Stop, Sir Charles. - Oh, now. - Wait. You're gonna throw up? Oh, no. I think... I think we're getting pulled over right now. - What? - It can't happen on a horse. I can't get arrested. I'll lose my medical license. Don't blow in that thing. I'm a lawyer. - I got this. - No! Oh, my God! Guys. - Ray. - Who? - Ray. - It's Ray. Ray from "I'm Too Good For You?" Ray, "This New Year" Ray? ♪ I'm too good for you ♪ Too good for you ♪ You girls havin' fun tonight? Let me go! Put me down! Oh, you just can't... You put me down. Since when did they let you start tellin' everybody what to do around here? Since they went and made me sheriff. Yeah, well, that was a big mistake. Feel free to come back and vote but until then you're public menace. You can't arrest me because I wasn't drivin' a car. But you were riding under the influence. Public intoxication, endangerment of the animal and evading arrest. Yeah, well, guess what? I'm not gonna talk to you. You can talk to my lawyer. Would love to. I will when she wakes up. Hm, oh, you just wait 'cause I'm gonna tell everybody in this town that you used to play mailbox baseball in high school. I replaced that mailbox a long time ago. Of course. Well, of course, you did. I forgot how sexy you are when you're drunk. You're not sexy when I'm drunk. I missed you too, Charlie. Hey, show me that one again. - Show me that one again. - Okay, okay. Oh! - Okay, arrest me again. - Go! Oh, my! Did you see that? Oopsy-daisy. Ah! That's called Krap Maga. I'm pretty sure that's not what it's called. It's close enough. Why don't you act like an officer, River? Oh. Um, hey, wait. - Do I have to go in here? - Yeah. Can we order some pizza? Pizza. - There he is. - Hey, what's up, fellas? Hank! Thank God! Listen, can you talk some sense into this power-hungry horse's... See what I've been dealing with all night, Hank? Can't you just pay him some bail or somethin' so that we can get out of here? I'm just here to play cards, huh? Wait, cards? Bridge? We're playin' poker. Well, I know how to play poker. Yeah, but we're playin' for money. I'm in. - Why not? - Okay. Oh, okay. Why can she get out and I can't? 'Cause she passed the breathalyzer and she wasn't drivin. You can't drive a horse. Keep talkin', darlin', let's see where that gets you. Ah, hold 'em, no limit. - Alright. - Alright. Awesome. Have fun, guys. Awesome. Fold. Fold. - Fold. - Mm-mm! So do we have enough for bail? Brought in a ringer, did you? Yeah, you got enough. Wake up your lawyer. - Wake up. Wake up. - Come on, ladies, we're free. We're goin' home. - Happy bachelorette party. - Yeah. I cannot believe you are making us muck out the stalls. It was Rose's idea. It's the least you could do after scaring Sir Charles half to death. That poor horse. Well, I didn't get any sleep last night, Hank. Yeah, I did. You're ruining my bachelorette weekend. I'm supposed to be relaxing and drinkin' mimosas and enjoyin' the sun. Hey, you got no one else to blame but yourself, sis. Why doesn't Laila have to help? She bought her freedom. Okay, is this how I do this? Kathleen, let me help you out. - Do you see the manure? - Yeah. You gotta get underneath the hay to get the manure up, okay? See, what you wanna do is you wanna bend your legs down. - Mm-hmm. - Take your hand right there. So get underneath. Alright, so we want those against the wall, alright. - Against the wall? - Yeah. - You wanna give it a shot? - Okay. - Alright. Count of three, okay? - Okay. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. There you go. Yeah, you're gettin' the hang of it. So you see how the manure and the hay is separated? - Mm-hmm. - You wanna take that manure and you wanna throw 'em in the wheelbarrow. - Okay. - Alright. You got this. - Now you're gettin' it. - Okay. I'm so sorry that happened. But look, tonight we're gonna have drinks and relax. Maybe we can do masks. We'll have fun, I promise. Oh, oh, oh. You ain't comin' in my house like that. Now go around back and wash up. There's a hose and a brush back there. Come on, I'll help you. And there's poop on my face. I hear you had a little run-in with the law last night. And you also ran off with my horse without askin'. So, am I grounded? Not so long as you stay out of any more trouble. Unless gettin' picked up by the sheriff was your plan. My plan was to avoid him at all cost. Oh, so it was come to town avoid Ray, convince me to give you your mama's dress all before the dust settled so you could head right out of town for another seven years? Did you say you were sorry? - To... - Ray, for starters. You and I both know you need to apologize to Ray. And not just about that song either. He knows I didn't mean that. Does he? Well, you need to know it hurt your mama that you never came home. Phone calls, excuses. You know your mama hated to fly but no, you couldn't be bothered. She was sick and she flew out there anyway 'cause it was you. Maybe she'd still be here if she hadn't. That is not fair. I had no idea. Every time I talked to my mom she told me she was proud of me that she was so excited that I was in Los Angeles writing songs. She never told me she was sick and neither did you. You didn't come home to visit your family then but a dress will get you to fly halfway across the country now? I think you need to get your priority straight, young lady. And until you do, my answer is no. Now, are you gonna make your brother do all the work around here or you gonna pitch in for once? Don't you leave that wet towel on my chair. So is this what you do all day? Yeah, you know, this and that. Feeding the animals, mending the barn, the water trough. Everything to keep this farm going. Are you in this for the long haul? Yeah, well, small farms like this financially, it's tough, so I am trying to talk Rose into building some sort of B&B on the ranch. Kind of a come, stay, work the farm reconnect with the earth kinda thing. - Really? - Yeah. Wow, that actually sounds like fun. Well, she's set in her ways, so it's been slow-going. Oh, yeah. I haven't noticed. So if you're gonna be here a while I'm gonna put you to work. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. We'll learn how to anchor barbed wire. - Why not? - Hey, guys, I got you some tea. Oh, my... - Sis. - Oh, my gosh. Are you okay? - I have to go help her. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, don't move. - Look at me. - Charlotte. - Sis. - Oh, my gosh, we're so sorry. - Ah. I'm okay, guys. - Is she gonna be okay, Laila? I don't know if she hit her head. - I need to look at her closer. - You alright? Oh. Oh. - Okay. - No, that hurts. Okay. What's your name? - Tell me your name. - Really? - Tell me your name. - Charlotte. And where are you right now? I'm at Rose's house. - In what city? - Harmony. - Okay, squeeze my hand. - Unfortunately. Squeeze my hand. - The other hand. - I'm okay. I promise. Well, you got clocked pretty hard so have you experienced any nausea or vomiting? Have you experienced Babs' wine? It's literally poison. You're probably gonna need some more after I tell you this next part. What? When we are observing a patient that has concussion symptoms the medical literature would suggest and in many cases, I would insist... - Laila. - Yes? What are you trying to say? You're just talking a lot. Um, okay. - Um... - Ah. You really shouldn't get on a plane right now. - No. - Charlotte... I can't do this anymore. I have a song to write. I have a million things to do. I just wanna go home. I know, but it would great if all that could wait until Monday. It can't! I'll miss my wedding. I'm not missing my wedding. - I'm fine. Seriously, I'm fine. - No, Charlotte. - Okay, alright. You okay? - Ah, no. Alright. Sit down. Okay, look, I just want to observe you, okay? And maybe you'll heal and be fine in a day or two and we'll just see what happens, okay? This is the worst bachelorette trip ever. ♪ I don't care where you're from ♪ ♪ I don't care what you got ♪ Hey na na na hey na na na ♪♪ Alright. Here you go. Vanilla with cotton-candy dip and sprinkles. My mama used to get me this. It's the best therapy. Ooh. Charlie. Ladies. Who is that? What do you mean, who is that? - Ray. - Ray? Ray from the song Ray? What? Are you joking? How drunk were you the other night? I don't know. Are you girls staying out of trouble? I'm not talking to you. Alright. Oh, wait. They must have changed management. This ice cream sucks. It's not that bad. - I like it. - Come on. Ah, I'm still bleeding from that barbed wire. Here, let me see that. Do you actually use a handkerchief? I ain't used it today, I promise. Alright, you just gotta apply a little bit of pressure to stop the bleeding. You gotta hold on to this, alright? - Is that better? - Yeah. - A girl could get used to this. - What? Me taking care of you? No. All this. Country stuff. You think so? You seem, uh, pretty city to me. You know, Charlotte told me you used to live in Atlanta. Yeah, that was a long time ago. Do you miss it? Not when I have to drive 30 miles to go see a movie? Sure, but then again, I never have to find parking. Get to spend my days building things, fixing things watching things grow. No paperwork, no meetings. You probably don't get that. You're quite the city girl. Yeah, well, don't go jumping to conclusions. City hasn't been very good to me. - No? - No. The firm that I gave my life to doesn't care about me. My apartment is shrinking by the day and the guy I thought was my boyfriend actually has a girlfriend. - Well... - Yeah. I should be a life coach. I could teach the Kathleen method. Yeah? Whatever Kathleen does, do the opposite. Yeah, I hear you. Why did you leave? Mom and dad. I had to go home, take care of things. Just never left. Charlie thinks it was all some grand gesture to get back and help out Rose. Truth is I was already on my way home. You know that feeling you used to get when you handed in a paper like you completed something? Man, I lost that feeling of accomplishment. E-mails, standing desk. I just couldn't do it anymore. Life is simple here, in a good way. You gotta take a moment to stop and think. It took me a while, but... I eventually found my way back home. - How's that hand of yours? - It's alright. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hey, baby, what's going on? Yeah, ho-hold on, hold on. Let me turn down the TV. Yeah. Hey, so how's it going over there? You finished the song yet? No, I haven't finished the song. Okay. Uh, well, I gotta tell you the label is all over me. Alright. They're, they're really wanting something, anything. So do you have anything? Yep, my working title is "My Fiance Only Cares About My Music And I Still Don't Have A Dress." Well, I like it, I think the label might shorten the title a bit. What about the other song? Sara Beth's people have called me minimum three times today. Spencer, you have no idea what's going on over here. You're right, I don't. So fill me in. What's happening? Well, she won't give me the dress... Alright, uh, baby, I gotta stop you. You gotta let the dress thing go. Uh, you grab it and run or I'll buy you one. It doesn't matter. It's a dress. I mean, you wear it once, you throw it in the attic, right? Just focus on the song, okay? Oh, great! Thanks for all the support, babe. Charlotte, don't get me wrong, okay. I'm for you, you know that. I just, and I hate to say this I think your priorities are a little out of order. - My priorities? - Yeah. Perfect. Wow. Um, thank you, Mr. Publisher. Next time I call, I would really appreciate it if I could talk to my fiance, okay? Ow! Oh. Guys, why have I never owned cowboy boots before? These are the most comfortable shoes I've owned in my life. See, I told you country living could be fun. Lord have mercy. I think I have just found my future ex-husband number four. - I think he may be five. - Oh, whatever. Honey, when you get to be my age you just rack 'em up by the half dozen. Kinda like donuts. She dates like I buy shoes. Hello. To friendship. To making it out of here alive and with a wedding dress. Amen to that. That's the first stage I ever stood on. Really? Yeah, I used to sing here on the weekends. Mostly like Patsy Cline covers and stuff like that. But one time they convinced me to sing a song that I wrote and they liked it so much that they asked me to do it again. Well, you should sing tonight. This is your crowd. Nah. Uh, isn't that... Hello, Harmony. Okay, well. I'm sure you've all heard it. - We need to leave. Let's go. - Come on. Harmony's favorite little songbird local songwriter and more recent jailbird... Is getting married. So, how about it, Charlie? You got a song for us? Charlie, Charlie, Charlie! Charlie, Charlie, Charlie! Charlie, Charlie, Charlie! Why are you my best friend again? - I love you. - No, you don't.

I mean, only if Charlotte wants to. Come on, Charlie. Okay. Let's go. - Okay, great. - Alright, come on. Hey, you guys go ahead. I think I got to take Babs home. - Appreciate, brother. - Oh, Babs. - Yeah. - Good luck, baby. Babs. - Have one for me, sweetie. - Babs, wake up.

Shh. I told you be quiet. Shh, shh. Oh, come on, sis. Don't look at me like that. We were out celebrating your granddaughter getting married. Well, don't let me get in the way of $2 beer night. You ain't missed one yet. Didn't sound like the bride-to-be came back with you. - She still out celebrating? - Come on, Rose. Give Charlie a break. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, you do. I'm just trying to teach the girl some responsibility, Babs. She's spoiled. Mary always spoiled her. Head in the clouds, never listened to anybody. And now after all these years, she finally comes home. People do strange things when they're afraid. I know you miss her, Rose... and so do I. But punishing Charlie is not gonna bring her back. Let her wear the damn dress, Rose. You know it's what Mary would've wanted. Come on. Mary loved Charlie. And so do you. I'm gonna get us both a drink. - Nope. - What? No, I don't have a girlfriend. - Oh. - Just in case you're curious. And why would I be curious about that? Oh, come on. You know I've had a crush on you since, like, the day I met you. Yeah, and you were a teenager. Yeah. And you're Charlotte's brother. Well, there's no laws against that. - You live here. - Yeah. And I ain't asking you to move here. - Tonight was fun. - Yeah, it was. I mean, after you insulted me and branded me a criminal in front of all of Harmony. I'm glad you think it's funny. - Mugshots live forever. - Oh. I haven't been on stage in forever. - Why is that? - I don't know. Because I got used to being behind the scenes. No. That is one place you don't belong. You need to get out of the shadows more often. I forgot about that song. It's really good. We used to write great music together. Yes, we did. I can't believe you still have a blanket back here. You're still picking up girls and bringing them to this spot? - No, not for a long time now. - Mm-hmm. Doesn't mean I shouldn't be prepared though. Oh. I came here a lot after you left. Do you know I bought a recording of every song you ever wrote? Every song? Every song. Even "Too Good For You." You spin a good yarn, Charlie. I'm sorry I wrote that song. No, you're not. No, I'm not. Well, it started my career. So thank you. I'm sorry if I hurt you though. Well, it's just a song. Even though people do still snicker behind my back tellin' me they're too good for me. If I remember correctly, it was me that broke up with you. - Yeah. It was. - And you were angry. - I was. - Oh, my God. Why... did you break up with me? Charlie, you're a star. Anyone who's around you sees it. All that you've accomplished since you left here none of that happens if you don't get out of Harmony. You didn't belong here the rest of your life. So let me get this straight. You dumped me to help me. You said I'll find somebody someday and I would thank you. Was I wrong? And then you went and told the whole world a different tale. You told the world that you broke up with me. Well, my heart was broken. So was mine. I can't. I can't. I'm engaged. Late night? I, um... No, I actually got up early this morning to... Charlotte, don't lie to an old lady. It's disrespectful. I take it you apologized to Ray. Something like that. I don't know if you know this but I had a romance before your grandpa. Nathaniel. Handsome thing. Great dancer. Made my heart do something wild. He went into army training, got stationed. Four years is a long time when you're young. And while he was gone, I met your grandpa. Steady like an oak. Kind. He was a quiet man, but something about him just felt like home to me. I remember the day that Nathaniel finally came back. My heart still did that little flutter but something inside me had changed just the same. Now I didn't have a choice by then. I had your mama on the way but it broke my heart to say goodbye. But sometimes goodbye is what you need to take the next turn on the road. Seems like you have a decision to make. Marriage is a long time... if you're lucky. It's even more beautiful than I remembered. Your mama looked perfect in it. She would have been happy to have you wear it too. Wasn't right for me to keep it from you. So it's yours. Oh. Good morning. How was last night? It was good. Good. Uh, thank you. Spill. We just fed the pigs. Alright. I kissed Hank. Ooh! - And? - And it was great. But I realized it's a bad idea. Wait. What? You have a great guy who is incredibly good-looking and smart and a lot of fun. Because it would never work. He lives in the middle of nowhere. Oh. That's the beauty of cell phones and airplanes. Look, you have been so focused on your plan and the way that life is supposed to go and now all of that has fallen off the rails. Which means that anything is possible. Yeah, and full of uncertainty. Or potential. Now eat your eggs. Well, good morning. I need the fastest rental car you have. Well, you have a reservation? Do I need a reservation? You can call this toll-free number. Someone will be more than happy to help you. Okay. Reservations. Seriously? Excuse me, sir, I'm on a phone. Okay, okay. - Charlotte. - I need to talk to you. - You okay? - Yeah. Look, you're right. I never would have left you if you hadn't broken my heart. I spent so much time mad at you because I loved you so much and I was so happy with you. But I'm not, I'm not that girl anymore. I really wasn't right in the country and I'm not perfect for the city either. I'm somewhere in the middle and I would've never known that if you hadn't hurt me. And I found my music and-and my songwriting and-and Spencer. And I love Spencer. And last night, I'm... - Charlotte. - I'm sorry, I... I know. I had to come to a conclusion about you and I a long time ago. And it hurt like hell. I'm so proud of you. All that you've accomplished over the last seven years and to think you're gonna throw all of that away just 'cause of a drunken kiss with an old boyfriend. I know better. I love you, Charlotte... and I always will. You're an amazing woman, Charlotte. Spencer is a very lucky man. Hey, I want you to get your hands off my fiancee. Whoa, whoa! You know, I get to speak to my lawyer, right? Look, please, Ray, don't lock him up. He's usually harmless. Harmless? He just assaulted an officer. - Yeah, well. - Well, nice jab. Bit of a cheap shot, but it was a nice jab. Please, Ray, let's just... What are you doing? Oh, my God. Seems like you two got some talking to do. Y'all kiss, make up. I'm gonna go grab a coffee and be back in ten. Oh. Well, you could have called. That would have saved me a trip. Spencer, it's not what you think. - It's not? - No. I tell you, it's one thing to see you two... on video together but to see you two in real life, that is that's something else entirely. You've got it all wrong. Tell me something. Why didn't you just come home? Because I hit my head. And I tried to tell you. When did you try to tell me that? I tried calling you, I tried texting you and you didn't respond. What am I supposed to think then? I'm sorry. I've been upset and confused. You're confused? Good. That's good to know. A week away from marrying you. It's good to know that you're confused, Charlotte. Lately, all you care about is this stupid song. You don't even ask how I'm doing? And I went out with my friends and we bumped into Ray and he asked me to sing and I go on stage. I haven't been on stage in forever and it was fun. And what? You had fun and what? - Spencer. - We're adults. Spit it out. Did something happen? Tell me. - We kissed. - There it is. - No. - No, Spencer, please. I've heard enough. You two love birds get enough cage time? Look, man, I'm sorry I hit you. Could you please let me out of here? You're free to go. Spencer. I overheard you two talking. You need to know that it's me that kissed her. She loves you... very much.

I can call you grandma, right? - No. - Sure, darlin'. - No? - Just him. I don't want the rest of you getting any smart-alecky ideas. - I'm special. - Oh. We gotta celebrate!
