Three whiskeys I didn't know he had such a bad memory Or doesn't he give a shit that we are agreed to keep our activities legal For him not to go making waves Once you stir up the police, it's all of us who suffer You know what I think? I think it's unsafe to do business with guys who don't keep their word Cos you never know when they're gonna stab you in the back So what are we supposed to do about it? Spit it out please In the words of Al Capone, everyone screws his enemies but nobody fucks a friend Does that spell out for you Rocko? It sure does What do you say Lacara? I have to go use the phone It's not your night Santoro, do yourself a favor I'm a successful man in life, because I never give up You got a light?

Will you level with me? If you'd known it was me Would you have let them kill me? They pay me to protect everyone The honest people and pimps like you. That's too bad you don't have a better opinion of me Like the ones your friends seem to have, they try to kill you My friends! I don't know who that is You telling me you've never seen him before. And you got no idea who he works for, right? I don't know who that is and I wish you'd believe that Don Calise will get a bang outa this Ready to blow It ain't healthy to go around bugging Santoro Like I was saying the patient's in no condition to speak yet - Has he been accused of anything? - No, not yet - Thank you - Nothing at all - Oh Doctor - Yes? Notify me when he's in a condition to speak Lue are you sure that's who it belongs to? Surely, yes One of his tanker fleet One of Santoro's men hijacked it about an hour ago It's got a cross on the tail Were the hell are they? - Just past the 5-0 marker on Highway 8-niner - Ten Four This time I'm sure as hell not going to let Santoro get away. Go on Floor it! They've just past the 5-7 mark, think he doesn't know about the car Good job, now move out, I'll take it from here You got it Captain Follow that tank truck, I'm a police officer Go faster Eh, you boys want to make my old age miserable huh? With your shootings, your killings! Like wild animals, like mad dogs - It's that bastard Santoro, he started it... - I don't want to talk about Santoro I have great affection You know that when they killed my son He never once left my side I love that man like my son Now leave me alone, I'm tired You've bothered me enough for one day Before we go Don Alfredo I want to introduce my son to you He wanted to have the honor of knowing you So that's the famous Don Alfredo? That old guy? That's him all right That old fella lifts a finger and you're as good as dead boy What is this? It's a robbery coming from the commissary! Please don't shoot! Well, we've made it Try to put a call in to a chopper, they'll be there Operations calling Chopper Xray-echo-37 Check out quadrant 22 N 18, one of our cars has been stolen Chopper Xray-echo to operations Sighted your car on local 4, he's got the hammer down. Calling all units, 12 blocks around the local 4 southbound, we want a dark BMW sedan. Dark BMW sedan, that's them go! Put your foot down Now slam on the brakes and jump out of the car Now we're even, you go your way and I go mine Hold it Get out Come on move it Get out of the way, move it I won't even pretend that this whole business isn't embarrassing Since, we have to assume the statement from the man in the ford is credible Are you trying to tell me the one made by Officer Marino isn't? Your men are very loyal to you, that's understandable But Officer Marino who was driving your car that day Admits having seen Santoro change his mind Not kill you when he had a chance You can't deny that's pretty strange Belli It's not so strange if you remember what happened in that parking lot Yes, I know, but even considering that Once upon a time you might have saved his life The fact remains that even though you caught him red handed With no alibi - Santoro still didn't kill you - what is this are you putting me on trial? I don't go off half cocked with you - We just want to get this thing cleared up - You're right! It sure wouldn't be the first corrupt cop you've come up against No one's saying you are accused of corruption That's right, that's why I'm saying it now! There's something else I want to say That's exactly what Santoro had in mind when he let me go He wanted to create an atmosphere of distrust in this office He succeeded, he shattered my credibility as a cop A little more subtle than putting a bullet through my head Come off it Belli, you're one man who's always enjoyed our complete trust Oh sure! That's a load of shit and at this point there's only one thing I can do And that's to bring him into this office, in front of you alive Even if I'd like to stick my gun down his throat and pull the trigger - 18 black, you win sir - It's about time, it's my lucky number - 36 times - here, buy yourself a hot dog Don't anybody move, keep your hands on the table Get over against the wall and get out of the way! Move! - I said back schmuck! - Listen punk, you know who we are? You guys must have lost the will to live Because we'll find you, so help me You'll pay in spades for this You fuckers are as good as dead Save your breath asshole Too much talk makes me nervous Let's get out before it's too late Don't move or we will Are we going to let em crap all over us? What are we waiting for? Come on! Hey you guys... you'll get yours... I'll find you! I bet you guys were shitting yourselves? Shut up and drive You guys got talent, keep up the good work. With any luck, you could pull in ten to twenty. What do you say Captain? Sure beats driving a cab don't it? Oh yeah you bums got some future ahead of you, no doubt about it All joking aside I want to say you all did a great job Naturally, everything that happened remains in this office If the old man ever found out about it We'd be on the street without a pension I don't know what you mean I was out drivin' my cab all night long - What about you guys? - Geeze, I hit the sack long before midnight Enough of the bull, get out of here Go home and get some sleep Let's grab us a pizza see you tomorrow Louie Hey, it's after 3, where we gonna get a pizza at this hour? - So long Captain - So long... Let's count it - How much is it? - Twenty seven million lira and change You could buy a small farm with it But that wouldn't be right, would it Cap? No it wouldn't Tomorrow you're going to donate it to the fund for orphans of Police Officers killed in the line of duty On a part of an anonymous benefactor - Find something? - yeah! I think I got somethin' on Lacarda Shouldn't hold on to incriminating letters But that doesn't help us with Santoro Never know Come on what do you want from me? Last night after an anonymous phone call one of our patrols moved in on a group of hoods who'd just pulled off a robbery They all managed to get away but they ran so fast they left the take behind if I'm any kind of judge, I'd say they'd pretty well cleared out an illegal gambling parlor Gambling parlor? All I play is a little Canasta, or a little Bridge, that's it. Yeah and you get your thrills raising orchids, right Mr. Smart-ass? Look mister, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not some wise guy on a street corner. You've got some questions you wanna ask me, I'll be happy to cooperate. But not until my lawyer gets here, you approve? Right, if that's what you want But it's not really necessary I just wanted to give you your wallet back You're lucky, they left your credit cards Something wrong Something missing? Come on, you know exactly what's missing Maybe this is a good time to call your lawyer and if he's good He might get you off with three to five What's his number? Or would you rather have a nice friendly chat? - Well, why not? - Sorry pal, I'm just makin bacon. Ah go to hell you little creep Oh no, here we go again Hi Captain OK squirt, what are you up to? I got me a wonderful job Sir Parking cars in a no-standing tow away zone And just what are you doing with that? - I'm saving that place - For who?

L'ts all set, according to your orders Captain Ten four, I'm standing by - I even rang your bell but nobody answers - I always park right here, everyday The police said you can no longer park here, it's a tow away zone What did they take my car for? Just look over there Now you have to pay the fine Taxi - Where too Mister? - Take me down town - Where downtown? - Just take me to Prince St, I'll let you know when to let me out He should already have him in his cab by now This is Lima ten, I'm on my way to Prince street to drop off a fare Check in when free Let's hope he's on his way to see Santoro Lucano's not stupid, if he passed us the word then he meant it, come on - Hey pull over here - At the travel agency? Yeah - thanks - that's ok - Mister you want me to wait for ya? - No thanks, I think I'll walk back This is Lima ten, I dropped him off outside the Travel Agency Ten four Lima ten I'll take it from here - Wait for me here, I want to see where he's going. Give me ten minutes ok? - Go ahead Run, run for your life Christ! I didn't hit him, he just fell over - Ah you're right the tip was on the level - I know If I'd been a little faster, we would have had our hands on him, who the hell knows where he's gonna run to now? He's taking no chances, there's ten different ways out of this building Cerrari had this on him Have you locked the car? That's good, hold it Another like that Nice, I like it Hey, stop that car Calling all units in green zone 26 Red alert, stolen four wheeler, heading in the direction of Santa Cruz It's a Lancia Stratos, it's called Italian Racing Red, license number Naples 9-8-7-5-1-3 You've got this all wrong Sir, I'm going straight You put one over on them, but not on me squirt Come on let's go Hey just a second, what you so mad about?

A couple of years in the reformatory or a good boy in school? Uh policeman ain't got no sense of humor if you ask me, can't you guys take a little joke? Little joke! What about everything else you've been in to? - Just jokes - Yeah, my ass. Like your last job as a parking attendant You really kept a great eye on the cars It's just too bad when you left all the tires were missing What do you say a stretch in the reformatory might not be such a bad idea huh? What's going down here? Well... I'm keeping an eye on one of Santoro's men He lives near here, 20 St - George Street, apt 4 What's so special about him? Eh I don't know Guess I'm just playing a hunch Captain He's keeping an awful low profile Or maybe I'm just wasting my time That's the name of the game old buddy Where did you say he lived? - Right over there - 20 St George St, Apt number four That will be all Ros, you get into the car and don't move Who is it? Don Alfredo sent me Hold it Get your hands up Don't make a move or I'll nail your ass, nail your ass so help me God You should have been an acrobat Instead of a cop Enjoy your walk 'cause not even the good Lord would think twice about giving you less than 30yrs Now move Are you sure about that? Move So, if I'm caught, let me see you get me outer here Now just take my advice Do yourself a favor and walk out alone Get the hell outa here while you can You got no choice, you're on my turf now Captain Hop in Captain We made in uh? You still sending me to that old reformatory? Watch where you're going or you'll end up in a hospital Santoro He's all yours Now why don't you go ahead and ask him any questions you might have For instance why he didn't kill me when he had the chance? - Good day gentlemen - Wait a minute Belli At least give me a chance to congratulate you That's very kind of you Sir, thank you In any case Captain Belli, it's hardly necessary for me to remind you that we never for a moment doubted your word 'course not, never said you did Now if you'll excuse me Unfortunately Santoro isn't the only criminal in our city There the liar, let's go - Put me through to Inspector Belli - Sorry Captain Belli's not on duty tonight Then give him a message will you Tell him the mother-fucker who put the finger on Santoro just blew his tires Poor Ros I guess we got here right away, before anyone else got a look Really, we gotta keep this out of the papers It serves no purpose You see how Santoro is He goes on killing even behind bars And when I asked her you never guess what she said, white and blue She's really not a difficult child She's precocious, all A's. We are sending her to a special school She knows more about it than I do. Tina! Oh Tina! That man's taking her away Tina stop! Tina come back here! Tina stop! Somebody help me, Tina! Stand back Get back Take him away Break it up, come on, go! In the car, get in there No let me go They tried to kill me, I'm frightened. You are going to have plenty of time to be frightened You'll see what I mean when they lock you away Give him a message will you, tell him the mother-fucker who put the finger on Santoro just blew his tires Let me hear that once more Give him a message will you, tell him the mother-fucker who put the finger on Santoro just blew his tires Captain, there's no doubt about it, that voice belongs to only one man, Salvatore Fabiendo What did I tell you Captain, that Caparece has a memory like an elephant then other one has got to be Henry Cortono They always work together I want everybody outa here Let's go number one Move it What the hell you waiting for Christmas? I said everybody out Why don't you fuck off Ok ok, I'm gone Now get moving Where do you think your'e going? No Keep moving boys Left right, left right... keep walking You want your lunch setup at the restaurant as usual?

You ain't ever going to use it again you... You three go search those prisoners, get this man to the infirmary Get back to the yard We got to get this guy to a hospital immediately, call an ambulance O.K. but if we don't stop that bleeding Hey what do you think this is, a circus, go on back to bed, the shows over, go on Without you I would have spent my entire life in prison Eh, for as long as my health permits, I'll always be ready to help, you are like a son Here you know where to go, you'll be safe there Thank you I'd be very careful, not only the police are after your hide. And I don't want to have to worry Come closer my boy May the Madonna always protect you Don Alfredo Go on, you better get started The more I think about it the surer I am. Cerrari wasn't going to use that plane ticket, Santoro was What do you want to go to a place like Metz, France for? Could be he had friends there, or maybe he just wanted a change of scenery He knows that sooner or later we'll catch up with him Anyway I want to talk with Metz... I want to run down all the Neapolitans living there, or any other Italians I got a hunch that someone up there must be in a position to protect Santoro First I want to do a little digging into his background - Plain water. - Plain water... Mineral water... in a second - Carbonated. - Carbonated... Carbonated Carbonated Carbonated - Move your butt Fatso - Gianni I'm doing it as fast as I can Look I don't want no back talk Go on move it through Water, bottled water... mineral water... get your mineral water! Water! Mineral water, get your water, mineral water! Hey kid, a bottle of mineral water - Carbonated or plain? - Plain A fine choice lady, plain water is just the fix, you owe us 500 lira. Here's a thousand One, two, three, four...oh! - Sorry lady, it's my fault, now I haven't got any change left - Ha, right, keep the hundred lira - Give me the 400 change - Thanks lady and have a pleasant day Water! French: Thank you very much, Goodbye Mr. Champs, goodbye To hear him tell it, Metz's a little paradise. Population 150,000 honest hard working people - Crime almost non existent - No Neapolitans eh? The police chief of Metz has a great sense of humor He says no Italian would live up there, it rains too much There's no spaghetti either For as funny as he is, there's a Neopolitan woman living there When she first arrived... she worked as a singer in one of the local pubs She got married to a guy in construction That was about two years ago, that's her She's a pretty good looking lady Ok, so let me in on the secret, what's so special about her? What's the connection with Santoro Her real name's Lucia Parisi She arrived in Metz, using a phony passport, calling herself Barbara Sandey She used to go with Rafael Lasini, son of Don Alfredo But it seems that before that she was close to Santoro and on the night he was murdered Rafael left his house just after receiving a phone call From a woman - Lucia Parisi to be exact? - Yeah, they used her as the bait Probably didn't even know it And who do we know who was in a position to use her too get to the son of Don Alfredo? - Santoro! - See, it all adds up Kid died and she ran Yeah, that has to be it She figured out what was going down And she was afraid So as long as she's alive Santoro can't rest, sooner or later, the truth will come out and get back to Don Alfredo, who treats him like a father At this point we haven't got any choice, if we're going to catch Santoro We gotta get Lucia Parisi back to Naples if she shows up here he's gonna blitz it That's right and he'll do it in person Cause he can't afford the risk of somebody else making a mistake Son of a bitch he doesn't give a shit about us He's afraid of Don Alfredo If the old man wants revenge, Santoro knows there's no place on earth he's gonna be safe Do you know how to get a hold of Francesco Cordi? then get his ass up here rightaway Hello - Oh yeah that's right, I was looking for you - You wanted to tell me something? No I can't come to you, you'll have to tell me now - Well I have to be very careful - That's why I was looking for you Because that jerk-head Belli's been hauling my ass down to Headquarters everyday Yeah, what does he want? I don't know, it's something about they got this broad coming in from France, a place called Metz I think They wanted to know what she had to do with you? I wasn't given no name, I don't know if it means anything Thank you Francesco I'll contact you, ok, so long Yeah, hang loose Santoro - Let's hope he bites - Don't worry, he will He gave me this, make sure he get's what's coming to him We've arranged for the finest plastic surgeon in the country You'll be just like before After that you decide And if it's to leave the force, we're going to find something for you You don't have to Captain I chose the police force, I'm going to stay - You want a cigarette maam? - No For you upsetting the life of a respectable person, doesn't mean a thing, right? Look lady it's not that heavy, it's ten minutes with a judge, you sign a piece of paper then you can leave - It's just to close a case - What if I refuse to cooperate? - It could have been done through the Consulate - No, no, you did the right thing to come Naturally When someone has a run in with you guys, that's it, because you can always threaten to blackmail But lady it's not like that Arwthins going on? Not yet sir, but we've got the place covered get your water, get your water... - Any sparkling water? - No sir, no sparkling water Whatcha got? - Just plain water Sir - Alright, give me one - How much? - 500 Hey Gianni, don't you think we'd better move on? Before some dope catches on and beats our ass? I know but this is going to be my last week, I'm going away to school - To school? - Yeah, I've decided to become professor or scientist Getcha... Hello, hello! May I offer you a bottle of the nicest water mony can buy? When are you gonna learn you can't spend your whole life going around cheating people? Now get outta here, all three of you - Come on! - Just trying to get by, that's all officer. Come on guys let's go Water, get your water, get your bottled water... Local train from Caserta is now arriving on track 15 Down Guido! There! You go that way, you over there Captain! Captain! He's on that train!
