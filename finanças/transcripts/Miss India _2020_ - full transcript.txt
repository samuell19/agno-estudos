"Greatness is a quality. It's neither acquired through one's recognition… nor lost because of being unacknowledged." My grandfather told me this when I was young. But then, I was not mature enough to understand what it meant. And when I understood what it meant, he was no more. If you really want to know the meaning of this statement, you need to know my story. My name is Manasa Samyuktha. I come from a small village called Lambasingi near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, India. I belong to a simple, middle-class family. Disgusting! What's with this dirt? You are supposed to come straight home when Dad leaves for the camp. Don't say anything to her! She fell into the gutter by accident. Enough with the nonsense. Do you think I am your teacher to believe all your lies? I am your mother. What other things have you done discreetly? Did you eat something on your way back home? No, Mom. We didn't eat anything. You ate something, didn't you? No, Mom. I know that you look at your feet whenever you lie. Don't look at your feet. Look at me, and answer me. You ate something, right? Okay. Dad must be on his way. Go and take a shower. Wear your nightclothes and come back here in ten minutes. -Kamala! -Yes. -Dad! -Dad! Dad… why do you look so dull? How was the camp? -It was okay, dear. -Give it to me. One's stress also increases when there's an increase in the salary. This is what a middle-class man has to go through! Dad, I had asked you to get me a watch. Did you get it? I forgot about it, dear. You and your forgetfulness! Last time, you forgot your watch. And this time, you forgot to get a watch for him. What's happening? I will get it next time. Go and set the table. I am starving. -Go. -Come. Arjun, Sahana, Samyuktha. What's happening? -Is everything okay at school? -Yes, Dad. Why hasn't Dad arrived yet? There are experiments going on with a new drug in the clinic. I guess he would be back only when those conclude. Today, they got their progress reports at school. Arjun, is there any progress? Or is it the usual regress? I got a B, Dad. Wow! What about you, Sahana? I got an A, Dad. I topped the tests, Dad. Remember, good grades are of no use if you don't have any goal in life. It's been six months since I asked you what you would like to become. By the time you get your next report card, tell me what your goal is. If you're unable to do that, then your good grades wouldn't matter. Samyuktha, what happened? Are you not able to sleep? -No, Dad. I have a stomachache. -Oh. I can't sleep. I want to go to Grandpa. Now? I will give you some medicine. Take it and sleep. We shall go tomorrow. No… I want to see Grandpa. At this hour? Keep quiet and go to sleep. No, I want to be with Grandpa. If your mom wakes up, you are going to be grounded. Get up slowly, and come with me. BHARAT AYURVEDA CLINIC Dear, are you feeling better? Now that I helped you feel better, what are you going to give me in return? A kiss. I don't want it. Then, what do you want? I want my Samyuktha to become as famous as the Queen. The entire nation should sing your praises. They should be proud of you. They should like your work. Promise me that you will do that. Grandpa, I don't know about that, but I promise you that I will show the world what a great man you are! There's nothing great about me, dear. I love this country, so I worked in the military for a few years. And now, with my little knowledge of medicine, I am looking after the people of the village. This tea is enough to prove what a great person you are! And people should know about this tea. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Samyuktha! Happy birthday to you -How many students are there? -I'd say approximately 500. Samyuktha, what do you want to be when you grow up? I will finish my MBA, and then I'll start a business. Yeah, right! As if she is really going to start a business! No, dear. Men do business. This field is not meant for women. A girl should be educated, and she should marry a guy chosen by her parents and settle down. No. I am not that kind of a girl. I will do as I please, and be whoever I want to be. -Brother. -Yes, Samyuktha? I've finished my project research. I'll be there in some time. Come. Everyone is waiting for you. If someone tries to scare you, you should be scared, Mr. Siva Rama Krishna. Who are you, dear? I am from Blue Dart, sir. I've come here to deliver your daughter to you. -Kamala! -Yes? Someone is trying to prank us! I was just acting, but you are going overboard. Samyuktha, come. Hi, Mom! Not just Samyuktha, it's Manasa Samyuktha. Alright, come. -Hello, lawyer! -Hello. -How is your practice going? -Perfect. -Dear! -Grandpa! Is all well with you? Yes, Grandpa! Hey… Dear! What happened to you? -Dad! -What happened? -What happened? -What happened, Dad? When Samyuktha came home after two months, he couldn't recognize her, doctor. Arjun… what I'm about to discuss with you is a sensitive matter. Your father has Alzheimer's. Stage five! There is a moderately severe decline. It means that his brain function is declining. He's suffering from memory loss, and that's why… he is unable to recognize people. So… please don't do anything that may give him stress. Make sure the people he loves are beside him, and take care of him warmly. Just like a kid. I strongly feel that… it would be better if he doesn't work in a situation like this. I understand what you're saying, but the family's responsibility is on his shoulders. People of his age generally do not get this disease. Maybe, he got it at such a young age because of the stress at his work. He's been continuously working to provide for the family. As his eldest son, it's time for you to take the responsibility of the family. Both of you are mentally strong… that's why, I am discussing this with you. You need to subtly break this news to your family members. Grandpa, it's quite late. Please, have your dinner. No, dear. I am not hungry. It's not advisable to go to bed on an empty stomach at your age. Please, have it. Alright… I'll eat after some time. Samyuktha, sit with me. He lost his mother when… he was just two years old. Since then, I didn't pay attention to him or this household. He used to wake up at five o'clock in the morning, finish all the household work, and go to school by himself. In the evening, by the time I came home from the hospital, he would get the food ready. I never urged him to study. He studied hard on his own. And he worked hard to get to where he is now. And now, he's suffering memory loss. Samyuktha, fate is very strange. So… the amount of hard work you put in life is not the most important thing. How happy you are in life is the most important thing. Nothing matters if one is not happy, Samyuktha. Keep that in mind! What happened, Mom? Why do you look dull? It's been more than a month since he went to work. We have to pay the fees. There are education fees, medical fees, etc. They are increasing day by day. Kamala, don't worry. I am here. I am going to take care of their education fees and his medical fees. Sahana is starting her practice as well. That would help us in one way or another. Arjun, I am going out. Take care of the house. Stop! Sahana… what's this? You didn't tell us anything about this. How dare you marry some stranger and come to us for blessings! Please, let us explain-- Don't you dare speak! I have no reason to speak to you. Mom, he is my husband. We've been in love since a long time. We knew that you wouldn't agree. That's why, we had to get married this way. How could you do this despite being fully aware of the situation at home? Instead of being sensible… you have just been selfish! It's better to be childless… than having a daughter like you! Mom… Perhaps, his memory loss is God's way of shielding him from seeing what you've done! Had he seen what you have done, he would have died of a heart attack. Before he comes to know any of this, get out of the house! -Go away! -Mom… Sahana. -Kamala-- -Dad, don't you have to go to the clinic? I am ready. I'm going to the bank. Come, I will drop you off. No, son. There's still some time left. In the meanwhile, get some rest. -Why should I get rest? -Just do it! -Arjun, take him inside. -I am alright. Dad, I spoke to you about my semester results the other day… Kamala, what happened? Why is the house lit up? Dad… it's Diwali today. Diwali? A lot of bad things have happened in this house. What's there to celebrate? Diwali is celebrated when good wins over evil. Dad used to tell this to us when we were kids. Really? When did I ever say that? Dad, brother has completed his studies. Soon, he will get a good job. After that, I'd also be done with my MBA. I will start my business immediately. We wouldn't have any kind of stress or fear. Ours is not the kind of household that indulges in businesses. It'd not be a right decision in these circumstances, Samyuktha. Be smart about it. Finish your MBA, and get a good job. Get rid of those thoughts of starting a new business, Samyuktha. When I wake up in the morning, my tummy is all bloated and my throat is entirely dry. He gets irritated as soon as he gets out of bed. He gets impatient and agitated for every single thing. Please, take a look. Here's what is wrong with your husband. Every night, he has alcohol with soda. The gas in the soda gets trapped in his stomach, so it's bloated because of that. He is responsible for that! Don't worry. I will write you some medicine. Hello, Doctor Viswanatha! Please come in, Miss Manasa Samyuktha! You came right on time. Take this medicine, and brew him a cup of tea with that. -At your service, Grandpa! -Thank you. She's my granddaughter. She loves me a lot. She's got all of my qualities. Wow! This tea tastes like ambrosia. I've never had tea that tasted this good in my entire life. It looks like your granddaughter will be your serious competition when it comes to brewing such kind of tea. I'd be the proudest person if my granddaughter becomes more successful than me! Come on, Grandpa. I learned all this from you. You should thank my grandfather, not me. Darling… make me a cup of tea every day until my last breath. I don't want anything more from you in this life. Grandpa, not just here… but no matter where you go, I will never leave you. It's not so easy to escape from me. M. Tech Mechanical engineering… 2020 batch… third rank goes to Mr. Arjun Chaitanya. Thank you, sir. -I hope you get done with your MBA soon. -Don't worry. It will be done. -Arjun Chaitanya! -Hello, Professor GK. Congrats again, my boy! Thank you but why, sir? I saw your robotic design. It has impressed me a lot. My gut told me to send it to American universities, so I sent it. They are immensely impressed. You know what? They have offered you a job in America. If you are interested, you can go and join next month. Sir, is this for real? I cannot believe it. Yes, you've made it. I'm totally proud of you, my boy! Thank you so much for your help. I am in desperate need of such a job right now. -I know. Good luck. -Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. I need to immediately tell this to Dad and Grandpa. I am confused about how to tell this news to father-in-law. We sent the children from our village to the town for their education. For their higher education, we sent them from towns to cities. We made our peace… with the fact that they're living far from us in the same country. And today… they have to leave us behind to pursue jobs abroad. Our condition will improve… if all of us relocate along with Arjun. And that is what all of us feel. My husband would get a better treatment over there. Samyuktha will have better job options over there… after she gets done with her education. You've sacrificed a lot for us. At your age, you need to rest more. That is why, we think it would be the best if you come there along with us. Nothing's wrong with my age. I would still be sturdy for another five years. You all can go to America as per your wish. Don't think about me. Grandpa, if you don't want to go, I will stay here with you. I am not going if you're not going. I don't want to impede your desires, dreams and opportunities. It is up to you. You can do whatever you feel like doing. Grandpa! Grandpa, here's your cup of tea. Once-- Grandpa. Grandpa! Get up, Grandpa. The memories we have of the person we love the most… give us a great deal of happiness. And when that person leaves us forever, those very memories bring us a lot of pain as well. But this is life. We cannot be sad forever. We should not miss the opportunities at hand. We have to leave in two days. Be ready. Greatness is neither acquired through one's recognition… nor lost because of being unacknowledged. You always believed in that, but I believe that everyone should know what a great person you are. Samyuktha. Come. Get in the car quickly! We're getting late. I hope you didn't forget any luggage. -Let me help you. -No, I got it. I am feeling very proud. Everyone in the village used to ask me what my achievement in life was other than working in a bank. Look, it is with the same bank job that… I have managed to get you all here to the USA. That's true. We are all here because of you. She is definitely an Indian. Let's go talk to her. Hey! -Hi. -Hi. Are you from India? I am Padma Nayana from India. I am Preethi from India. Hi. I am Manasa Samyuktha from Lambasingi. -Wow! -Oh, nice. -I am pursuing an MBA in Marketing. -I am pursuing an MBA in HR. I'm in Finance. -Nice. -First day? Oh, is it that clearly visible? Chill! First day here is usually like that. Let's go and have a cup of coffee! -Yeah. -Actually, I am a tea addict. I've been looking for a good cup of chai ever since I got here, but no luck. Everyone here drinks coffee. Forget chai. Let's have a cup of coffee, and KSK Coffee is the best. You should definitely try it. So, what are your plans after completing your MBA? I want to start my own business. That's my dream. But my mother and my brother don't like the idea. Let's see what happens. -Hi, girls. What's up? -What's up, Alex? You do remember, right? Be there at seven o'clock, sharp! Even if we try to forget it, I don't think you will ever let us. Oh, you silly girl! If beautiful girls like you don't come to the party, what will happen to the beauty of the party? See you there. -Right. -Bye! Who was that? What was he talking about? That is Alex, a local wannabe guy. He arranges parties around. So that Indians like us can get to know each other. If you come, you would get to know a lot of people. I don't like to go to parties. You guys go ahead. Samyuktha, this is America… the most happening place on the planet. Please, come. You will realize why I am saying this. -Anyway, we are in the final year. -Yes. We might not get a chance to enjoy ourselves again in life. So, enjoy it to the fullest. -Alright, I'll think about it. -Here. Thank you. Come on. Four! Dad. Samyuktha, come. Kohli is doing a fantastic job with the batting. Sit down. His score is 56. He's going strong. India is just 50 runs away from a win. -Exciting! -Dad, that was yesterday's match. India lost the match. What are you talking about? They are playing really well. Watch it. Damn! -Let's go dance, Preethi. -No, wait. Hi. Hey! Look, Samyuktha is here! -Hey! What a pleasant surprise! -Hi. -Thank you for coming. -Hello! How are you? Hello. -Three tequila shots, please! -Hey, I don't drink. Oh, really? Then, why did you come to the pub? To perform prayers? "A life spent without tasting wine, whiskey or vodka is a big waste." That is what my grandma used to say. I have a cup of chai when I am happy… and a cup of coffee when I'm angry. I don't know any other beverages than these two. Alright. The three of us are together for the first time at a party, so we should do something crazy. Shall we play "Truth or Dare"? -Yes. -Yeah, come on. -Truth or dare? -Truth! -Okay. -How many times have you kissed until now? -How was it? -No, only one question. -Okay. -Come on. Truth or dare? Dare. Look over there! Do you see that couple? Create a rift between them. What? They might hit me! Rules are rules. -Are you sure? -Yes! You must do it. Alright! -Have you been to India? -India? No, Vijay. Never. Hi. What's up? -Hey, who are you? -I'm Manasa Samyuktha. -Samyuktha? -Manasa Samyuktha! Okay. Do I know you? Hasn't he told you that we are getting married next week? Sorry, what did you say? I said we both are getting married next week. Okay, Vijay! See you, bye. Stella! -Stella! -Hey. Stella! Actually… -This is your phone, right? -I am so-- -Stella! -Wait, Stella! -Stella! -Stella! Oh, God! -Sorry, I didn't mean to do that. -Why would you do something like that? Well, my friends had given me a dare. They asked me to create a rift between you guys. That's all. I'm really sorry. Please, give me my phone. Dinner? No, it's not possible. -Then, I cannot return your phone. -Hey! You're taking a disadvantage of the opportunity. Didn't you do the exact same thing earlier, Miss Manasa Samyuktha? What should I do now? If you want your phone back, come and have dinner with me. Going with him for dinner doesn't make him my boyfriend… and me his girlfriend. -It's okay. I'll go. -It is alright. It's just dinner. I am not asking you to date me. Let's go. Oh, man! Having dinner with you is just like watching a silent movie. I am here to have dinner. I am not on a date. I'll tell you something. And if you don't want to speak with me even after that, I'll keep quiet. I saw you at the pub earlier… even before you saw me. I found you very interesting from the moment I saw you, but I couldn't approach you as I thought you might misunderstand me. But look at my fate. Amid all the people in that pub, you came and spoke to me. I've invited you to dinner so that we can understand this situation. I hope you're not uncomfortable. If you don't mind, could you ask them to pack the leftover food? Why? Let's order something fresh. Well, I don't like wasting food. So, I will give it to someone else. Oh, charity, right? Not really. It's more like humanity. Giving for the sake of giving is charity. And sharing because we have enough is humanity. That's quite clear. I know. Yes, sir? Anything else? Samyuktha? Do you have chai? Chai? Oh, no! Sorry, ma'am. They don't serve chai. Why do you look so sad as if you've lost a million dollars? I've lost something more valuable than a million dollars. But you don't need to know that. You seem to have found something in the water over there. You've been observing it seriously. Nope, not really. You told me that you lost something more precious than a million dollars. May I know what it is? My grandfather! He left this world, and left me alone. I have always adored him ever since I can remember. I am not at all feeling good… about leaving the house I grew up in, my village, and my country. If everything happens as per our heart's desire, why would we call it a "life"? Anyway, nothing is permanent here. Neither you nor me. There is nothing much we can do other than forgetting and moving on. For someone like you who's been away from his country, forgetting someone might not be such a big deal. I remember every minute detail about him even today. You wouldn't understand. Samyuktha, wait a minute! I lost my mother when I was ten years old. I stayed in my room for a month after her death and cried. My mother never came back. But the pain always remained. So, don't think that I don't understand your pain. I said that to console you. I won't deny the beauty and charm of India. But America is beautiful as well. If we could inculcate the simplicity that we see in nature into our thought process… we would be at peace. You are using your pain as an excuse to stop yourself from enjoying the beauty and happiness that exist in this country. If you give it a chance, you will see it. I have saved my name as "Vijay" on your phone. If you think I made any sense today, call me. I will be waiting. Hello! Thanks, Vijay! Ever since I started seeing the beauty that surrounds me… I started feeling better. That's great! -Are you free tomorrow evening? -Yes, I am. I have two tickets for a movie. My friend has some work, so he can't make it. Would you like to join me? I was waiting for him to ask me out. Now, he's asked me out just like they show in the movies. Well… I'll think about it. What do you mean? Mr. Vijay, if a girl says she will not come, it means she is thinking about it. If she says she will think about it, it means she will come. If she blatantly tells you that she will come, that means she isn't a woman! Oh! Which movie is it? You will know if you come. Okay, see you there. In India, it didn't matter how you used to dress up. But this is America. It's time you flaunt your beauty to this country. What do you mean? Do you mean I don't look beautiful now? -No, that's not what-- -Hi, miss. May I help you? Wow! You look beautiful! I like your style. Where are you from? -India. -Oh! Let me show you our collection. Please! Vijay. No. No. No, Samyuktha. Black doesn't suit you. Let's go with Grey. How do I look? -Beautiful! -Thank you. I don't know how you would look in a Grey dress, but you look really gorgeous in black. I'm happy. The world is going to look at you in a new way. Thank you. Manasa Samyuktha, shall we go? It's all quite new, these colors Flow across the sky as a rainbow Time is dragging its feet Because it doesn't want to be shortened You don't have to look back On yesterday's tears This endless unattainable happiness Is all around you Even if the paths have changed The spring hasn't hidden itself Let me explore this extension Of friendship and try something new Thank you, Vijay. I was very sad when I was leaving India to come to the US. But after knowing you, I've become an entirely new person. Thank you so much! Coffee? Coffee is not my cup of tea. Thank you. Will you at least say "cheers"? Cheers! I am confused about What I want to wish for When I am with you I don't feel any kind of bitterness I listen to the sweet music Coming from the bamboo flute I am looking at the corner of My heart that houses immortality Wow! This cup of tea tastes 100 times better than a cup of coffee. Superb! The darkness that's present in the east Only dawn can make it disappear This distance keeps shrinking As we come together I can feel the heat in this light How is it? Do you remember? When we'd met for the first time, I had said that KSK Coffee is the best. I was wrong. -This is ten times better than that. -True indeed! Thank you. -Cheers! -Cheers! Now, I'd like to announce the topper of this trimester. Miss Manasa Samyuktha! It's all quite new Where are you off to? Can't you see? I'm going for a jog. Jog around the house! Don't go elsewhere. You will forget your way back. Oh! Are you questioning my memory? People used to say that I have a very good memory and the knowledge of each and every document in all the cupboards of the bank, the number of currency notes in the locker, and the amount of money in each and everyone's account. Just because I moved here, do you think that will affect my memory, Vimala? You remember all that, but you forgot the most important thing. -My name is not Vimala. It's Kamala. -Oh! So, you changed your name after moving to a new country! Don't hit yourself so hard. You will suffer memory loss. SWOT analysis is very important before starting any business. Listen. This is important because of the clear overview it provides. What? It is "SWOT." "SWOT" means… the strengths, the weaknesses, the opportunities… and the threats that exist in the market. It's a self-analysis to understand our situation. Actually, this analysis is quite useful in our lives as well. How does that work? Take my life as an example. My decision to pursue my goal of starting my business is my strength. My inability to champion my goals and dreams in the company of my mother and brother is my weakness. The life that is ahead of me in the world as big as ours, is my opportunity. My insecurities about not fulfilling my goals are my threats. Wow, Samyuktha! It'd have been great if I had the same clarity of thoughts as you. Despite the clarity I have, nothing is ever in our control. The toughest thing is to put your ideas into action. And that is what life is all about. So, being positive is the best solution. Samyuktha. Yes, brother? What's this? Open it. Wow, a watch! I really wanted it. Thank you, brother. This is my favorite color. Time is the most valuable thing, Samyuktha. This gift is to remind you the same. How does it look? It's very nice. Thank you! Here is your interview letter. Go for this job interview tomorrow. Alright? Brother… I know how important time is to you, but I also value my time a lot. I wouldn't like to waste my time on a job. I have a goal in my life. And you know that very well. Samyuktha! We enrolled you in an MBA course… so that you can do what is necessary for our family. If you want to stay with us in this house, you must listen to me and do as I say. It's your choice. Mr. James Patrick… cabin one. Mr. Peter Dillion… cabin two. Mr. Goyal Gabeth… cabin three. Miss Manasa Samyuktha, please go to the cabin number four. Excuse me, sir! Hey, Samyuktha. What a sweet surprise! Hey! There won't be any interview for you. You are selected! Had you informed me earlier, I'd have hired you right away. Thanks… but hire me only if you find me fit for this job after interviewing me. That would make me happy. Well, Samyuktha. I am well aware of your talent… so I'll skip all the technical questions. I will ask you only one general question. There are three guys waiting outside to crack this interview and get the job. Why should I reject them and hire a woman instead? Well… why should I hire you? I am an MBA graduate. I've been a topper right from my nursery to my post-graduation. That means… no guy ever surpassed me. That means they did not surpass a woman. Other than education, there are many things that a girl learns to do since her birth. She does multitasking, planning, organizing… handling the house, protecting herself, sharing love and affection, and whatnot! No man can ever go through the pain that a woman undergoes while giving birth. According to a scientific research, women are more mentally stable than their male counterparts. In business, men cannot surpass the financial models put forth by women. And when it comes to me, I never waste my time. That means I wouldn't waste your time either. If you hire me, I'll make sure that I perform better than the best employee of this company. So, hiring me is only advantageous to you and you'll not regret it. Wow! Electrifying! You are selected. You can start working from tomorrow. Make calls to all these people, and close at least ten sales by the end of the day. Okay? Okay. Okay. -Hello. -Hi, I'm calling from Matrix Advertising. -This is regarding an ad sale. -Okay. You can get the best space on the print, web and digital media to place your ads. Please, do let us know. Sorry, not interested. Thank you, have a nice day. -Yes? -Hi, I'm calling from Matrix Advertising. -This is-- -Call me later. -Okay, thank you. -Hello. -Hi, I'm calling from-- -Get lost. Samyuktha, you need to impress the customers by bluffing a little. Samyuktha, we expect you to perform nothing less than the best. Good, Samyuktha. I see that you are adapting. Good job, Samyuktha. Keep going! Great job, Samyuktha! You are now the Employee of the Month. Sitara… those people from Vijayawada would like us to give them our decision by tonight. Did I study hard since my childhood, came to the USA… and got a good job so that I can quit it and get married, Mom? It is a very good match, Sitara. Job is not a big deal. Hurry up and come to India soon. See you. Sitara. Is there any problem? My mom had called me from India. Apparently, they've found a good guy for me. But they don't want me to continue my job after the marriage. I don't know if I am supposed to feel happy that they got me a good match… or feel sad that I have been told to quit my job. How can that be a good wedding match if they're asking you to quit your job, Sitara? They have so many conditions even before you're married. Imagine what's going to happen after you get married. Don't get swayed by what your mother says. Consider what you want and then decide. This is your life. You are its owner, founder and the sole proprietor. Okay? -Bye. -Bye. You encourage others to live their lives on their terms. But are you really implementing that… in your life? Grandpa, I don't know about that, but I promise you that I will show the world what a great man you are! I will start my business, Dad. The amount of hard work you put in life is not the most important thing. How happy you are in life is the most important thing. Nothing matters if one is not happy, Samyuktha. I am not happy with my job at all. This is so sudden. Why, Samyuktha? See. A sale is a beautiful bond between a customer and a seller. I don't want to do it with the lies… adjustments and compromises. Let's just lie and get it done. I'll make sure that it'd seem like an arranged marriage. Okay. We are just normal employees, Samyuktha. We must work according to the policies set down by the company. Compromise is like a close friend that pays us a visit every day. A lie is like our neighbor. And an adjustment is a lover who never leaves us. I hope you understand. Hey! -Hey! -How are you here so early today? Is everything okay? Yeah! You've finished your targets, right? Why don't your rest for a couple of days? No, I am feeling better here. Is there any problem at home? My brother saw us together at the restaurant. And that has led to a ruckus at home. Everything will go back to normal in two days. Don't overthink this. My name is Vijay Anand. I got acquainted with Miss Samyuktha even before she joined our company. Though I have everything in my life, I got this feeling that I found something that was missing in my life since quite some time, and that was because of her. And when she joined our company, every moment that I spent with her… every single thing I got to know about her, has increased my liking and respect toward her. She also likes me… but I don't think she will take it further against your wishes. That is why, she never said anything about liking me. If you approve… I would like to marry her. I can understand your fears as a mother. I grew up without a mother. If you approve… I promise to treat her as the most important woman in my life. I am sure I will take good care of her. Trust me. Samyuktha. When Arjun said that he saw you with a guy, I was really anxious. But after he spoke to us, I understood that he is a decent guy. Vijay had come here in the morning… and he convinced us to get you married to him. Vijay is in love with you. You are lucky to find a guy like him. We have decided to look for an auspicious day and get both of you married. Samyuktha… The Queen that is supposed to be trapped has now checkmated the King. My little world Has slipped through my fingers Hello! Why so serious? You came to my home today and talked about our marriage, right? -I was just thinking about that. -But why do you seem so serious? You should be happy, right? Vijay, I don't know what to tell you or rather, how to tell you this. To put it in a simple way, I don't want to get married now. Do you not want to get married? Or do you not want to get married to me? Vijay, let's not complicate things. I just don't want to get married. Samyuktha, do you know what you are talking about? It was so difficult for me to convince your family members. You can't do this now! It'd have been better if you had spoken to me first, before you spoke to them. Just because you took the efforts to convince them, I cannot marry you against my wishes! I was under the impression that you'd abide your family's decision. How can their wishes be mine? This is my life. At this moment, I don't wish to get married. But why? Why, Samyuktha? Marriage is a huge responsibility. There is a difference between being single and being with someone. A lot of things and priorities change. There are a lot of things that I need to accomplish… before I get married. What are those? Everyone has a purpose in life. And everyone is talented in one way or another. You, I… everyone! I believe when a person understands this, that is when his life truly begins. I want to use my talents and achieve something in my life. Samyuktha! I've been keeping a secret from you since many days. But I think it's time I tell you this. The company that you've been working for is my father's. Which means, it is mine as well… but I like to lead a simple life. That is why, I've been working as a manager instead of a managing director. If you marry me, you would also have a partnership in that. In my opinion, I don't think you need to achieve anything more than this. Thanks… but I don't want all that! I want to achieve things by doing everything on my terms and in the field I am interested in. Money can only bring us happiness… but when we pursue the things we like, it leaves us with beautiful experiences. You are not the same Samyuktha that I had met months ago. You have changed a lot. I've always been like this, Vijay. It's just that you started knowing me recently. There are hundreds of girls who are ready to get married to me happily. But why I got attracted to you is because I always wanted a simple life and a simple wife. But after knowing your plans today, I understand that you aren't simple… but a very complicated person. I am going to end this right here right now. Goodbye! One minute, Vijay. By the time you get to the office, you'll find my resignation letter on your table. My little world Has slipped through my fingers The bright light Of my dreams has disappeared Samyuktha, wait! What is with your unreasonable behavior? If you've already decided that my behavior is unreasonable, -anything I say would not matter. -Correct! Why did you say that you don't want to marry Vijay? Because I am not interested. I am asking you the reason. He told you that I'm not interested in him, but didn't he tell you why? Did you realize that after dating for six months? Or did you find someone who is wealthier than him? You might stoop so low for the sake of money, but I won't do that. -Hey! -Samyuktha. What's with that arrogance? He is your elder brother. And I am his sister. It would be better if both of you realize that fact. What does Vijay lack that you felt he's not suitable for you? Will we ever find a better guy than him? Mom, I am your daughter! How long will you consider the other people better than your own children? Stop thinking about getting better guys for your daughter! You should think they should be worthy of getting married to your daughter! I will be happy about it! You're saying this very casually now. But you'd know the burden and responsibility of a daughter… only when you give birth to one and raise her. Some people feel they're lucky if they have a daughter. And there are some, who think of them as a burden. And I am ashamed that you are one of them. Samyuktha, you are crossing the limits! I wanted you to marry Vijay so that you have an easy life! If you have any sort of respect for me, marry him. I don't want to get married without achieving something in my life. You had a dream of becoming a doctor… but you were pressured into marriage by your family and your dream remained unfulfilled. And post marriage, your life has just been about your husband and children! What do you want to do? Business. Samyuktha… I have told you numerous times… to remove the thought of starting a business from your mind. All these days, I just did the things as per your wish. But from now on, I'll do what I want! That's it! Samyuktha… you are living in a fantasy world, and it is very far from reality. You are a girl… and we are living in the USA. You come from a normal middle-class family. Unless you and your brother do a job, we can't make our ends meet. In such a case, doing a business-- Even if you start a business, what is the guarantee that you would succeed? There isn't a guarantee for all the great things that happen in this world. They work because of the conviction. That's it. I don't have any faith in it. I am least bothered about someone's faith and belief. I'll do what I want. It's alright if you don't want to support me. Just don't get in my way. I have been supporting our family for long… and now, you're telling me not to get in your way. If I leave this house, I will never get in your way. Why aren't you saying directly that you want to move in with your girlfriend? Stop! Why are you accusing your brother when you wanted to do something of your own against everyone's wishes? Yes! You'd never realize the facts that I put forth. He is about to get married to his girlfriend by making it seem like an arranged marriage. Ask him if this is a lie! I need not stay at a place where I am not respected. There is no need for anyone to go out of this house! I was the one who caused this problem, so I'll move out. Am I confronting the question? Can I ignore it despite Knowing the truth? The day you'd realize my worth… I shall return to this house. I've been waiting for that When you wait, your future calls you What's yours will always be yours It wouldn't go away Samyuktha… why did you ask us to come here so suddenly? I walked out of my house. I quit my job and broke up with Vijay as well. What are you saying? -Why? -To start a business. Business? What business are you talking about? Chai. Our Indian chai. In India, chai is as important as petrol. People don't spend a day without having a cup of chai. People drink chai when they're happy, sad, angry, irritated and on other occasions. And this place has been accustomed to coffee. They don't know the value or the taste of chai. And we must be the first ones to introduce the taste of chai to them. I need both of you to help me. What? Do you want us to sell chai? Coffee is sold at a very exorbitant price in the entire country. So, we should sell chai as well. Come on, Samyuktha. Stop joking. Establishing a business requires a lot of planning. Moreover, this is very risky, Samyuktha. If this idea doesn't work out, our time, effort and money will be wasted. Every successful business has potential risks. Success can't be achieved without taking risks. And if it is achieved without taking risks, it doesn't last long. I know that this will be a successful plan. I am sorry, Samyuktha. I can't help you. Chai? What is chai? Chai is an Indian version of tea! -A cup of chai makes everything better. -No, thank you. Would you like to have some chai? -Not interested. -It's Indian tea. Hi. Would you like to have some chai? You should try this. Hey! Would you like to have some chai? -No. -It's delicious. Hi! Would you like to have some chai? What is chai? Chai is an Indian version of tea! You'll love it. -Superb! I like it. -Thank you so much. Who gave you the permission to put this here? Get out right now. -Why are you… -Sir, nobody made any mistake. -Remove it. -I'm just making tea. Sir, please understand. This is my life. Sir, please! Sir, please! Sir, please understand! I'm not making any mistake. -Please! -Move. Let's go, Mom. If you give me 25 yards of your space, I can give you a 25 percent cut from my profit. No, I'm sorry. -Thank you. -Alright. So, if you give me 30 yards of space in your hotel, I can give you a 30 percent cut from my profit. No, I'm sorry. But why don't you meet Mr. Kailash? He is the owner and founder of KSK Coffee Chain and Group of Companies. He is also an Indian. Maybe, he can help you. Thank you. Yes. May I help you? Hi, I would like to meet the Managing Director, Mr. Kailash. Do you have an appointment? -No. -Sorry, ma'am. It's not possible. Just tell him that he might miss out on an opportunity if he doesn't meet me. Wait a second. Sir, but she says you are going to miss out on an opportunity if you don't meet her. I'll build an office just like this someday. Okay. Sure, sir. Please, wait in the hallway. Thank you. Hi. Hello. Whom do you want to meet? Wow! You are an Indian, but you look like an American. Is that a compliment or a complaint? It's a compliment, sir. My grandfather always used to say, "Be a Roman in Rome." Well, you didn't tell me whom you want to meet. I am looking for Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar, the Managing Director of this company. I heard that he is also an Indian. May I know the purpose of your visit? -I am here with a business proposal. -Oh! Do you have an appointment? The receptionist asked me the same question. There are way too many formalities for a person to meet another person. Rolex watch, polished shoes, smart dressing. Seems like you are here to meet someone, as well. Do you have an appointment? Does Kailash need an appointment to meet Kailash? The owner and founder of KSK Coffee Chain and Group of Companies. The winner of three "Business Man of the Year" awards. The one and only Indian to top the American Entrepreneurs list. And he's above all the busiest persons you must have come across in your life ever! Kailash Shiva Kumar. An appointment is a simple rule to ensure that a person spends his valuable time wisely. Well… I was told that I'd miss out on a wonderful opportunity if you don't meet me. And after looking at your beauty… I felt I shouldn't miss out on this opportunity and appointment. -Thanks for the compliment. -Welcome. -Manasa Samyuktha. -Nice name. Sit. Congratulations for building such a huge empire. And thanks for being an example for the people who aspire to become like you. Samyuktha… I've always wanted my life to be a source of mystery. But I never thought of becoming an example to others. How an Indian became so successful in America should remain a mystery, but my life shouldn't simply be an example… for the people to attain this position. Well, what is your business plan? Here. So, if you could lend me some space in your coffee shop, it would benefit both you and me. I am more impressed by your presentation rather than your product. Remember two things. Samyuktha and Kailash might go together… but coffee and tea would never go together. Secondly… America is a land of coffee. So, tea has no place here. Creating that place is the opportunity that I am looking for. One should look at the necessity of the product in the market before looking at an opportunity. No one here even likes to taste tea. People here love my coffee. Here, my coffee gives them the best form of relief. I am sorry to say this… but so far, the people who have tasted my tea… have complimented me saying that it gives them more relief than your coffee does. What? Did people really say that… the tea made by an Indian girl tastes better than my KSK coffee? -Very funny! -What's so funny about that, sir? They told me what they felt. If you want, I would like to prepare tea for you right now! -Would you like to taste it? -Sure, but not now. I'll taste it the day you attain my stature after starting your business. Sure. It is not about attaining your stature… but I'll work hard to increase the scale of my business. And in this process, my fate will decide whether I would attain your stature… or I'd surpass it. All the best. I hope you don't have to face any obstacles from my end. I'm writing you a check for a thousand dollars. It's for miscellaneous expenses. I'll be waiting to taste your tea. Sure. A thousand dollars might be a small amount to you… but I know what can be achieved with this money, and I'll certainly show you. Hot! Move. A little more. Stay! Hey, Samyuktha. Hey, how are you? What's all this? I might not be able to start a business with the little amount I have… but I can advertise about it with that amount. That is why, I've decided to perform a chai ceremony. Our tea culture is not a modern one. It dates back 5,000 years. Monks like Bodhidharma used to organize a chai ceremony in those days. A great scholar used to invite… his students and other scholars to his place for a cup of tea. The people gathered at his place used to feel pleased to drink the tea, meditate and go back to their place. After going back to their place, they used to spread the word about the chai ceremony to others and bring them next time to the ceremony. Tomorrow, I am going to go around and tell them about the chai ceremony and invite them to the ceremony. If we get to make the avid chai drinkers taste our chai, they'll spread the word about it to those who don't know about it. Hi. Please, do come to my chai ceremony. Chai? What is chai? Please, attend to know more about it. I will try. Thank you. -What's this? -It is a chai ceremony. Oh, I'll be there for sure. Thank you. You possess the talent to earn thousands of dollars. Why would you waste your life… selling tea for ten dollars? You can see my hard work, but you can't see the fact that my heart is in it. Our neighbor, Sujatha, saw you selling your tea on the road. Disgusting! I've been embarrassed by her behavior. Talking to her is of no use, Mom! Look, there's still time. You can still leave all that behind and come home. Point number one. As long as we haven't done anything wrong, there is no need to feel guilty or embarrassed about anything. Point number two. I wasn't shouting on the road… I was trying to sell my product. Point number three. Just because our neighbor thinks it's wrong, I am not going to stop myself from doing what I want. You might not understand my words or deeds. But I will wait for the day when you'd properly understand me. Hey… chai ceremony! Nice concept, dear! You are trying to introduce the concept of chai to a foreign country. It's really great. I am proud of her. Thank you. What's your name? Manasa Samyuktha. Nice! What does your father do? Go inside. Someone like our daughter is trying to sell chai. -Okay. Get inside. -Shouldn't we support her? I'll definitely come, dear. Hello, folks. An Indian girl named Manasa Samyuktha is organizing an event called "Chai ceremony" at 7:00 p.m. this Saturday at Royal Theater. Make sure you attend it. It's going to be amazing. Meanwhile, enjoy the song. Hello, everyone. Namaste. My name is Manasa Samyuktha. I welcome all those Indians who have come here because they were specially invited, and all those Americans who have come here… out of their interest. I don't intend to waste your time. I will finish the last line of my speech before you finish the last sip of your tea. I have a very special relationship with tea. Whenever I suffered from cold, cough or fever during my childhood, I used to have tea made by my grandfather. He was an Ayurvedic doctor. He was a great intellectual who believed that all ailments could be treated with tea. It's been a year since I moved to America. People generally claim that America is the most developed country in the world. The most surprising thing about this country is that there is no Indian chai available here. You won't find it anywhere even if you search for it. That is why, I have decided to start my chai business here. But we have green tea here. That's green tea. I'm talking about Indian chai. One of which you are tasting right now. Yeah. This is supreme! Nothing like it. Thank you! Coming back to the point… my intention is to introduce the greatness of the Indian culture to America through the chai business which I am going to start. That is why, I'd consider this as a responsibility rather than a business. Very nice! My name is Krishna Murthy. Though I am an Indian, I was born and raised here. So, I am not very familiar with the tea. Could you tell us what's so great about that? Sure. In India, most of the people can't spend a day without having chai. Right from the working-class people to the lawyers, from the students to the scientists, and from the children to the old folks… everyone has chai to get relief from the work stress and tensions in life. Chai provides answers to many questions. It provides solutions to many problems. That's its greatness. Don't you think it should be available in America? Yes, it should be available. -Yes, it should be available. -Yes, it should be available. -Yes, it should be available. -Yes, it should be available. If you think it should be available, I need your help. If you really liked my chai, buy a packet which is over there. And those who would buy it, kindly share your experience with your friends and relatives. That is the help which you could offer me. But Miss Samyuktha, what brand is it? Miss India! I am thankful that you have come this far to see me and listened to me patiently. Thank you! Well, you didn't tell me how my chai tasted. -Superb! -Superb! Thank you. -That was a really great chai ceremony. -Thank you. I've worked on a lot of businesses and I've started quite a few as well. But you are the only person I saw who's publicizing a business in an aesthetic and poetic way. -Thank you so much, sir. -A big business always starts small. Good luck. -Can I get one? -Sure, sir. -Here. -Thank you. Here is my card. Just in case if you need any help. Sure. Thank you so much, sir. Oh! Please, call me Vikram! -Thank you, Vikram. -Cool! -See you. -Bye. Bye. We really didn't know how serious you were about your business until we saw the success of your chai ceremony. From now onward, we will stand by you, Samyuktha. Thank you so much. America is the most happening place in the world. We need a good spot to launch our Miss India product. Nayana, could you tell me how much it'd cost to launch this product? It would roughly cost half a million dollars, Samyuktha! It'd cost three crores as per our currency. We need a really good investor. Someone who trusts us. Someone who has faith in our business. Vikram! Yes. Didn't you say that he was impressed by your chai ceremony? He is the President of the Indian Entrepreneurs Association. Before that, he was a venture capitalist. He has encouraged a lot of people to start their business. If we ask him for help, he might help us. Yeah. Miss Samyuktha is here to see you. Hey, Samyuktha! What a pleasant surprise! -Hello, Vikram. -Please, sit down. By the way, didn't my people serve you anything? Any soft drink or Miss India special chai? Actually, I don't think your guys can offer me what I want. What is it? The investment for launching Miss India will cost three crores. -If you could invest in our company… -What would I get? We guarantee you a minimum of 25 percent profit per year. As per that, we'll return your money along with the interest in four years. How are you so sure that… your brand-new product will be a success? You've tried it, so you should tell us whether it will be a success or no. Do you know any such success story? No. You are not associated with any other big brands, and there isn't a company that has launched something similar to yours. There isn't a necessity for your product in the market. The possibility of your business becoming a success is just 0,1 percent. I started with nothing, so I'd consider 0,1 percent possibility a good sign. Because… this is my dream. Forgive me, Samyuktha! Money should not be spent on dreams and desires! But I saw your perseverance and determination. So, I'll set my business rules aside and invest in your business. But there's one condition. If your year's profit is even one percent less than what you have said, you must return all my money along with the interest. And you must sell your company to me. If you agree, we can start signing the agreement papers. Get the money ready for the investment. Every morning stands as A ramp for your success You can't reach your destination if you Move in random directions like the wind Every minute doesn't reveal it But the next moment is not a myth either When courage is your consort There is no scope for defeat -This is for you. -Wow! This is fantastic, Preethi. A good poster creates a good impression about a movie. Similarly, a good logo creates a great impact for a business. The dictionary doesn't explain The meaning of unanswered aspirations The unwritten tomorrow is the only thing That stands in your way Appreciation for your courage would Be given forever by every generation Won't the sunlight fight And win over the darkness? Appreciation for your courage would Be given forever by every generation Won't the sunlight fight And win over the darkness? For the first time in the history of America, an Indian woman starts a business called "Miss India" with Indian chai. Let's wait and see what she can do. Every morning stands as A ramp for your success You can't reach your destination if you Move in random directions like the wind So, the day has finally come. The beginning of a new era… of chai in the United States of America. Thank you, Vikram. You are the reason behind all this. We are launching Miss India the day after tomorrow. You are our chief guest. Me? What do you mean? Talent and willpower aren't enough to achieve what we dream of. We also need the people who believe in us and support us. And I understood that when I met you. You have turned my dream of Miss India into a reality. So, who would make a better chief guest than you? I struggled a lot for the money in my life. I even helped a lot of people with the money. Despite all that, I still suffered from some dissatisfaction in life. But today… I am able to realize the greatness of my work and the real purpose of my life. This is because of you. Thank you so much! I will be there. Don't worry. Not because I was invited as the chief guest, but because my friend has invited me. Thank you. Miss India… I think we should taste the chai here. Chai? No, let's go to KSK please. Jingle! Oh. -Is she your pet? -Yeah. So cute. -Thank you. Thank you so much. -Is her name Jingle? -Jingle. Yes. -Nice. Now that you are here, would you like to taste our chai? -We just started today. -Sure. -Okay. -Yeah, please have a seat. Thank you. There you go. This is our special Indian chai. Nice! -Amazing! -Thank you. I'll keep coming from tomorrow. Thank you! It would be our pleasure. See you, Jingle. -Here is your tandoori chai. -Thank you! -Hey. -Give me five minutes. Okay. As usual… he's saying he needs five minutes to flirt with her. Hey… if you don't mind me asking… you like her, don't you? What's stopping you from talking to her? My voice. Would you talk to her if your voice gets better? Give me five minutes. Indian special! What is happening? What is this tea magic? Indian special magic! The credit goes to the great Indian woman and her beautiful chai. Here is your love chai. -Thank you. -You are welcome! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Miss India family. We are very glad to conduct our first board of directors meeting. And now, please welcome our Managing Director, Miss Manasa Samyuktha. The silence will break when Your struggle will make the sound The opposition will crumble When you'll fight the war With your silence Every morning stands as A ramp for your success Won't the sunlight fight And win over the darkness? Every morning stands as A ramp for your success Won't the sunlight fight And win over the darkness? It is a great privilege to be a part of this family. We shall conquer the world soon. Thank you. Coffee is our competition in this business. We should take over them and crush them. I appreciate it… but we should be our only competitors. If we better ourselves every second and move ahead… we shall be on the top eventually. You are truly a Miss India. You came from some remote part of India, and now, you are going to rule the American business world. Simply great! I only have one goal. Brands such as McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks started small in some remote areas, but today, they've become global brands. Miss India should become a brand as well. Everyone in America must know this brand. Miss India is not about me. Miss India is a brand. Samyuktha. This woman is the reason for our today's meeting. She started a business with chai. It was a company that didn't even have a dollar as a turnover. And now, it is at a stage where it is competing with us. If we don't control Miss India, it will surpass the KSK brand someday. Any ideas? Seasonal sales offers? Celebrity brand ambassador? Cross promotions, sir? Discounts? Offering discount means sabotaging the value of our own product. Price fall of our product means our downfall. And we can't afford to have the downfall. We should lure the customers. A woman should be taken down by another woman. Make sure our KSK outlets have hot girls every Saturday. Every coffee that's ordered should be served by a bikini-clad woman. Put an offer stating that the one who pays the highest bill would get a chance to take a selfie with the woman of their choice. For every guy who works hard the entire week… KSK outlets should become their only form of weekend entertainment. That way, we can target the Americans… as well as the Indians who are the prime base for Miss India. We'd target all of them to lure them toward us. Not only that, come up with a lucky draw. Announce the prize money of… one million dollars to the lucky winners who drink our coffee. Wow! You are a genius, Kailash! So, it's not going to be a Saturday from now on. It's going to be a KSK. -And here's your golden chai. -Thank you. -You can give the KSK bill to her. -Sure. -And this is your takeaway. -Thank you. -Hi. -Hi. Can you tell me about the offers? -So, do you have the KSK bill with you? -No. Okay. If you give us the KSK bill, you get the signature chai for free. And then, that's our masala chai, tandoori chai and this is dum chai. -Okay. I'll come back with the KSK bill. -Sure, thanks. Hi, guys! This is Manasa Samyuktha. And if you really like our chai, please visit Bloomberg and vote for us in the ongoing competition. And I would love to know your feedback, comments… anything that you would want to share with us. So please, put it in the feedback box which is right there. So, are you guys enjoying our chai? -Yes! -Yes! We have been working on our new marketing strategies to counter our competition. We shall update you by tonight, sir. Sir, they have started something called… the "Miss India Day" just like our KSK Day. It looks like we were the ones who gave them the idea, sir. I think we need to stop this. These promotions aren't needed as we've already been established in the market. I'd heard the adage that a fox burnt itself in stripes to resemble a lion. But now, I actually got to witness it. Miss India is just a start-up. If this dents us financially, it's not such a big deal. But they will not be able to handle the loss they'll incur by giving free chai. And eventually, they won't be able to compete with us. They'd unofficially accept the defeat by realizing our popularity among the public. Forget it. By the way, keep continuing this offer for one more week. Also, make grand arrangements for the lucky draw contest on the day of our company's anniversary. -Sure, sir. -Take care! -Namaste. -Namaste. Have some more. Okay. That's it. What are you thinking about? I forgot something. What did I forget? Do you have the KSK bill? -KSK bill? -Yes. This one, right? -Bijju! -Yes, ma'am? -Please, serve special chai here. -Okay, ma'am. This is the special chai made exclusively for you. Taste it and tell me how it is. Wonderful! Divine! Why have you come alone? I mean, why didn't anyone else come along with you? -Who else were you expecting? -Your wife and son. I don't know. Perhaps, they were busy. What about your daughter? If you don't mind… could you give me another cup of chai? I love it! Certainly! KSK and CO extends a warm welcome to each and everyone here. We all have gathered here to pick the lucky draw winner from the pool. From several thousands of entries, we have shortlisted a few. And now, I invite the Managing Director of the company Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar. KSK Coffee has been and is the best beverage company in the U.S. Some companies have come up with some cheap beverages… but KSK remains in the hearts of Americans. As a token of appreciation for their loyalty, we are conducting this competition and giving away the lucky prize to the lucky winner. And the number of the lucky winner is… 9-1-1-2-3-3. Can I see the lucky winner, please? So, Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar… are you shocked… to see me as the winner of your contest? The risk I took to compete with you has made me the winner… and allowed me to stand here on this stage with you. My dad was one of the members who drank your coffee. I inherited his luck. This will settle the expenses of last month's free chai. On top of that, I made profits. I would consider this a donation. What did you say? "Chai is a cheap drink!" Let me tell you something. Among the people who have tasted KSK Coffee and Miss India chai, 90 percent of them have outrightly voted for Miss India chai. So, looks like chai has a place in this coffee land. I am not just a lucky winner of this lucky draw contest. I am also going to be the winner of the competition between tea and coffee in the coming days. Remember that. Selfie, please. Thank you! In the ongoing neck and neck competition between KSK Coffee and Miss India chai, Manasa Samyuktha has come out with flying colors putting KSK in a big question mark. It will be interesting to see what his next move is. Keep watching for more updates. Chai… the fastest growing business! Miss India! Fantastic! Truly fantastic! You know… when I started my coffee business, it took me more than two years to attain this position. But you did it within two months. Wow! That's truly a great achievement! I had told you on that very day… my tea is ten times better than your coffee. I'm sorry. I couldn't properly understand you that day. I don't think you even tried to understand me that day. Look, past is like a dream. We should forget the past just like we forget our dreams, but shouldn't linger around it. That is when you achieve success in life. That is my philosophy. But what is the motive behind approaching me… even when my business is nowhere near yours? Excuse me. Can I have a cup of chai, please? Samyuktha… it's difficult to manipulate a sharp person like you. I'll come straight to the point. This is a blank check. Write the amount you want. If that's not enough, you'll get a partnership in the company. But make sure your business runs under the name of my company. I want your brand, Miss India, to be associated with my name. You were the one who told me that tea and coffee cannot go together, right? Similarly, Samyuktha and Kailash will never go together. How dare you offer me a partnership in my own business! You have observed me closely, and you know about me very well. Despite that, you came here with such a proposal. I don't know if this is your clever move or a foolish move. The struggle is not an item… that you can purchase from a store and own it. This is an empire which I have built by working hard, Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar. It belongs only to me. I'm ready to become a villain of anyone's life to become the hero of my life. That includes your life as well. There won't be any compromise in this. Remember something. You came this far by being under the radar. But now, you've got my attention. Let's see how far you can go! I came this far with my hard work. Not out of your mercy! You should remember that. I will see how long you can hold on to that confidence and arrogance! -Hey, hi. -Hi! Why had Kailash come to our cafe? To buy Miss India. I told him it would never happen and sent him away. Kailash is a very… dangerous man. Even when we're not doing anything wrong in life, there are a certain people whom we should fear. And Kailash is the first person among them. Anyway, from now on, we have to think carefully before taking any step. Okay. Forget it. Be ready tomorrow evening at six o'clock. I am going to give you a special treat, okay? -Bye. -Bye -Hi -Please, have a seat. Sweet. -Wow! It's beautiful, Vikram! -Yeah. -Thank you. -It truly looks like a special treat. So, is this your first? What? First candlelit dinner? Of course, it is. What about you? This is my first candlelit dinner with you. You didn't tell me the occasion. -It's my birthday. -Happy birthday, Vikram! Thank you so much. I make new resolution on my every birthday. So, for this year, I have made my resolution. What is it? To get married. Congratulations! Who is that lucky girl? I've always lived my life by believing in logic and reasons. But ever since I met you, I've learned to believe in the emotions. So, now… I want to start a new life… with you. Only if you are interested. Vikram… you are a very special person in my life. You believed in me and my business. You have invested a lot of money in it. What I am trying to say is… this is all because of you. But I don't have anything in my heart except Miss India. This is my entire world right now. I neither have time to think about anything else… nor any interest. If I've hurt you… I am really sorry. Six months! It's been a successful six-months run for Miss India in America. And the credit for all this goes to our founder and managing director, Miss Manasa Samyuktha. Thank you. Let's talk about our performance now. Though nine percent profit is a big number for our investment in a span of six months, we are facing a deficit of 16 percent to achieve the projected 25 percent profits. So, there is a pretty good chance. But even if we perform extraordinarily from now on, we might not achieve our year-end target. Actually, even if we perform normally, we have a chance to achieve our year-end target. But there is a risk involved in it. Two days ago, we got a mail on our company account. A business proposal from the BMC dealers. -What is the proposal? -For the next six months, we'll have to deliver three shipments of the material within a month to the BMC Solutions. But this is on the credit basis. If we sign this deal, we would be getting 30 percent of the profits from the BMC alone. Our company can't afford to deliver the material on the credit basis. It is very risky. We cannot go against the policies for the sake of profits. We all know that there is a risk involved, Vikram. If we continue to ignore these kinds of proposals, we cannot grow this business. Let's do a background check once, and if we think it's really safe, I think we can go ahead. Okay, if you are convinced, I don't have an issue. But remember one thing, one mistake and I'm out of this business. Nayana, go ahead and start the process tomorrow. Sure. -Hello, Samyuktha. -Yes, Nayana. I've just finished the inquiry about the BMC dealers' track record. -What does it say? -The feedback is very positive. I think it's safe. -Great! Let's finalize the deal then. -Okay. Miss India is very happy and privileged to be associated with the BMC. Same here. I hope our association will last very long. Sure, it will. Yeah, Preethi? Samyuktha, the first paycheck given by Richard has bounced. What? I had warned you about this deal, but you didn't pay heed and took this decision. Three shipments! In these three shipments, we've shipped the material worth eight lakh dollars to them. The first paycheck given by Richard has bounced. That means… we need to consider that our present running capital is almost zero. If we don't get out of this problem soon, we might need to wind up the business! The employees have figured out that the company is in trouble. We didn't even pay them the last month's salary. Many of them have already resigned. But those employees who still have faith in us said that they would wait another ten days. If we don't settle their accounts in the next ten days, they will leave as well. I just spoke to the credit insurance company. They told me that they'd offer help in returning the amount as soon as possible. But we didn't get it insured, right? We didn't get it insured… but I did. The money we would be getting now isn't ours… it's mine! When I give my money to you, I can't just afford to simply watch whatever you do with that. That is why, I took this precaution. Vikram, please give me one last chance. The employees are starting to leave the company. I must uphold the trust those people have in me. I will ensure that I don't repeat this mistake. I promise. Samyuktha… I never broke the rules I made for myself. But I did that for the first time, for you. I didn't know who you were and what your background was. And yet, I invested so much money into your business. That was the first favor I did for you. But you didn't uphold that trust I placed in you. But now, you have to return my money as per our agreement. And along with that, you must give me your brand, Miss India, as well. But I am not asking you to do that. This is the second favor that I've done for you. But now, you are asking for my help for the third time. In fact, I do want to help you. Do you know why? Because I am very fond of you. And you know that. When a person offers help to someone who is not at all associated with him, you must understand how much love he must have for that person. If you can't understand, there is no use no matter how many times I offer help. Favor? Vikram… approaching you for the investment… is an opportunity that I created for myself. Investing in my business was your choice. It means, it was purely a business deal. When it comes to the second favor that you mentioned, there are still three months left for our agreement's validity to expire. It's not yet over. If you help me in getting out of the current situation… then, yes. That would also be called a "favor." I will return your money along with the interest, very soon. Goodbye. Ma'am… all these days, we made a living out of the salary you gave us. And we won't desert you just because you are in a tough phase, ma'am. They say that sharing the problems relieves us from the sorrow. I've been with you in your good times. Let me be with you in these tough times as well. Whether you give me my salary or no, I'll always be with you. I heard about it. I am deeply saddened by your state of affairs. Had you sold your company to me that day, you wouldn't have been facing this problem today. Well, Miss Samyuktha… business is not a game for women. Business is war. Every minute, danger keeps stalking it. And half of our strength gets wasted in warding off the dangers. You are a mere girl. What do you know about this? You assumed that just because I am a girl I wouldn't know! Do you even know what a girl is capable of? If you give her a house, she will give you a family. If you give her groceries, she will give you food. If you give her happiness, she will return it with love. If you give her love, she will give you a new life. Whatever you give her, she always returns double of that. Whether it's good or bad. You seem to be quiet now. You've mocked me stating that a girl doesn't know anything about business. Now, I'm telling you as that same girl. Be ready to face double the amount of trouble you have given me, Mr. Kailash. The words of women don't make any sense They don't make any sense at all I never expected that we would have to face this day after establishing Miss India with so much effort, Samyuktha. Signing the deal in which a huge risk was involved is not a mistake… but I'm sure there has been an error somewhere in my calculations. Where is Nayana? I don't know, Samyuktha. I haven't seen her since two days. And she isn't replying to my calls and messages either. I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to go through more stress. Excuse me! Have you seen this person? -No. -Thank you. Samyuktha, I checked Nayana's landline call records as per your instructions. The last call she made was to Mandalay Bay Hotel. Betrayal has been a practice since the times of Mahabharata. I won't ask you why you did this. What is it that you have gained from doing this to me? It's simple, Samyuktha. Every person is greedy. It is the greed to be more successful than the people around them. But not everyone gets such an opportunity. I got that opportunity, and I used it. Your name is Padma Nayana. Your place of birth is Hyderabad. Your mother is a homemaker, and your father is a mechanical engineer. You have done an MBA, but you are doing a petty job in your friend's company. Your ambition is to become a reporter in the BBC news channel. Am I right? Nayana, let me tell you something that has benefited me… and that is going to benefit you now. If you don't build your dreams, someone will hire you to build their dreams. It means, if we don't work hard to fulfill our dreams… we will end up working hard to fulfill someone else's dream. I will give you an opportunity. If you do as I say… you will be paid an amount you would have never imagined in your lifetime. I will fulfill… your lifelong ambition of securing a permanent job as a BBC reporter. What do I need to do? I am not hurt that you have betrayed me. I am feeling bad for the fact that I can no longer trust you. Miss Samyuktha, how did your own friend betray you? Miss Samyuktha, is it due to your own decision that you landed in trouble? Miss Samyuktha, why haven't you doubted Nayana before? Miss Samyuktha, could you tell us what happened in detail? A guy couldn't stand to see a woman doing business. He tried to suppress her. So, are you out of business? I am born to do business! Business is not a monopoly. It is my birthright. All these days, I've heard people say business is war, but I never took it seriously. But I am telling you now… business is war. Here are the witnesses of the conspiracies of Mr. Kailash Shiva Kumar. I demand the jurisdiction to give him a deserved price for his criminal deeds. As the media, we'll do everything within our capacity to bring this to justice. But how is your company doing? Reports say that you are broke. With your permission, I would like to make a special request. Whoever recognizes the struggles of a woman… whoever desires the victory of good over evil… whoever loves the taste of chai… whoever believes that there is truth in my words… I am requesting them to lend their possible financial help. Each and every one who helps us shall become a shareholder of Miss India. And we will share our profits in the future. All that I can say is… I need your help. Thank you. It's simple, Samyuktha. In a shocking revelation, Manasa Samyuktha submits recorded evidence against the conspiracy done by Kailash and Nayana. You'd said that you'd return home the day we truly realize your worth. We have realized it now, so we have come to you. I didn't feel as much pain when I realized that I can't be a doctor… as I am feeling today for not realizing… the worth of my talented… and intelligent daughter. Mom, I left the house to fulfill my dreams… not because I was mad at you. If I have hurt you in any way… I am really sorry. All these days, we couldn't share your problems. But at least now, we got that opportunity. Miss India! India. I really miss India. Samyuktha, look here. We have already begun to get funds. It's 60,000 and it's still counting. Unbelievable! Ma'am… look over there. We are always with Miss India. Thank you. I have taken a new step In my little world The bright light of my dreams Shows me such miraculous wonders I have taken a new step In my little world The bright light… Excuse me, ma'am. Can I have another cup of chai, please? Shows me such miraculous wonders Miss Samyuktha, as the Business Woman of the Year, what is your message for today's youth? The most valuable thing in this world is your goal. If you realize your goal, value and dream, just get it. If you don't realize it, then your life is not worth living. We are not meant to fear God… or our college professors or even the society. We must fear the thought that this world will never get to know the hero within you. Life is an opportunity. It is a chance to prove yourself. Just prove it. Awake, arise, and don't stop until you achieve your goal. Thank you. There is no defeat Tomorrow is mine It's a short life Spend it with freedom Forget all your troubles There is someone within you that isn't you Leave it behind Take a new step and never stop Hey, brother! Serve me a cup of chai. The words of women make sense But you don't pay attention Oh, my God! What should we do now? I had told you that a woman will always increase your profits. I've added a thousand dollars to the thousand dollar check that you gave me. Enjoy it! Thank you, Miss India. Cheers. Wow! Thank you! Now, do you know the difference between my chai and your coffee? Every cup of coffee in your KSK outlet is made with money. But here, at Miss India, every cup of chai is made with love. Had I understood this before… I wouldn't have been in this situation. You still have time, Mr. Kailash. You had told me that business is war. Start the war again. With your luck. That's the spirit!
