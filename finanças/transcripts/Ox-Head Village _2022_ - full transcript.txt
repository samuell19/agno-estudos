People at that time spurned the twins, so they called them that woman giving birth to twins would be called a belly One of the twins will be nearly seven years old Return to the gods as the son of a cow Son of a cow? Why seven years old? Children of God before the age of seven After the age of seven, it is a child of man So before the age of seven Return the child to the village's bull-headed patron saint And let the child wear a cow head Bull head? How can I give it back to the gods? Throw the child in the hole why is it like this… At that time famine everywhere If this goes on, people will eat people. Live in hell But why wear a bull's head? Because I can't bear to look directly at the child's face Although it is said to be given to the gods But it's no different from killing What's the matter... Aunt Qizi... When you came back at the age of four Chizi is the only name you remember She said she played with Xiaoqi no! Can't go!
