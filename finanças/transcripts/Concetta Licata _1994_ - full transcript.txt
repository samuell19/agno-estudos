Stop chattering. Eat up your stuff! My innocence will be revealed. Your wife was here yesterday. You've got good taste. I invited her over. Not bad, eh? Is that OK with you? I swear, I'll kill you! Issue an arrest warrant, please. They are suspected of having shot the policemen. Santino is innocent. I've questioned him a few times. He's not capable of such an act. His testimony corresponds with his girlfriend's. He should be out. Please treat the case with care. It's very complicated. - Why? The case is a political issue. If we compromise the wrong ones then we're in big trouble. I'm only doing my duty and know I'm on the right track. Don't tell me what to do! My hands are tied in this case. The case concerns people who wish to remain anonymous. Those two are not to be prosecuted. The main suspect will suffice. I'll ensure he gets his just punishment. I require your utmost discretion. But I still want to arrest those 2. That's not necessary. - Why? - Insufficient evidence. They should be available to you. The Justice Minister is behind me. Why are you back again? I won't change my mind. He'll serve the 3 extra months. How can I change your mind? I'd do anything. Why do I have such a big heart? Get me the file please. He has to do overtime. Erase the incident from the files. Happy to oblige. I'll mind the baby then. Come to me! The director wants you to know, that he and your wife are together. They have a surprise for you. That's psychological cruelty! I'll make a complaint! Come right in! Not exactly luxury. But effective. Off with your rags! I like that. Excellent. I want to see more. Skirt too. You look great. Exactly my taste. Caress yourself. You're one randy little bitch. I want to see more. You'll get a heart attack. - I'll kill you, you fucking pig! Leave my wife alone, bastard! Kiss me. Give my cock a good wank. Suck my fat dong. You've earned that. I'll fuck you like you deserve. Now you're in for it. He killed himself! He's dead! Listen to this! They write that the tart testified against you. We have to do something. She didn't listen to us. We have to pay her a little visit! Any news? It's hopeless. They won't get those two. Despite my testimony. Don't lose hope. The court will believe you. You're an important witness. Put an end to this nightmare. I can't stand it here. I know. Well, cunt? - What's the score? Good news. He's ready soon. Tell him I'll stay on the ball. You won't forget? Wanker! I read the charge. Why do you want to talk? - Giovanni's innocent. Will you let him out on bail? That's up to the judge. Not my decision. Maybe we can sort it out in a different manner. Nobody needs to know. Giovanni must be released. He's too sensitive. Nobody comes out of here without a discharge certificate. If everybody paid, they'd all be free. I didn't want to bribe you. - I should hope not. I'll put it like this: That was a an ordinary attempt to bribe. Money flows, he's out. That's it. I can't be bribed. I've been here for 15 years. That's never happened to me. That's bribery. Bribery gets you behind bars. For 1 or 2 years. Depends on the judge. I'll pretend I heard nothing. You're committing a crime. That's bad. But I have a big heart. Especially for such a pretty girl. I know you. - Whatever. I need to talk. What did the tart tell you? Probably everything. Confession was not on her mind. Are you threatening me? I want to know what you know. Tell. You surely don't want anything to happen to her?! Do you want to harm her? - Think whatever you want. Priest or no priest. Tell what you know, or I'll Giovanni has it tough in prison. That's what I'll do. Prison can be a mean place. What do you know? I've no time. Giovanni could have an accident. You want to accept responsibility for that? You'd be implicated. Keep quiet! - I'm only starting. I'll ransack your church, if you don't talk. I hate the church. You ruin people's lives. I piss on your organisation. Sinner! Leave this place of worship! Slowly. A tip from me. You squeal, you're for it. You're a hero, a martyr, eh? Leave Concietta to us, get it? Or soon you'll meet your boss. That's a serious warning. Giovanni will be convicted. Keep your mouth shut. Or loads of innocent people will die. Then you can bury them. I was with the priest. - And? The mafia has threatened him. Giovanni is in great danger. The priest can't protect us. We can't expect him to help. Maybe they'll let him go. - They want him to be convicted. I'm scared. They're mafia methods. They're murderers. Come out, I have to talk to you. Why are you here? What's up? You should say that Giovanni told your husband he was guilty. That's inhuman. Leave us alone. If you testify, you'll be left alone. You should do it. Otherwise you've problems. Understood correctly? Do it. Then the family will care for you. You probably feel abandoned by everybody, child. He's got a good lawyer, right? Without him, they'll ruin him. They're dangerous. You have a lot of influence. I feel so abandoned. I feel that he's never coming back to me. I think they're after me. I'm scared. - What's the plan? I don't know. It's a tough one. I have the impression that they're all mafia. If so, Giovanni hasn't a chance. They'll wear him down. Santino. - What's up? - News. The boss's in a good mood today. He's got a visitor whom he probably regards highly. What does he think? - There are two possibilities. Either he wants to torment you or he's after your old dear. Suck my cock. My horny cock is sexy, right? Nothing like a bit of pussy. I'm about to come. That was good. I'd never tell you where she is. She and her boyfriend shot the policemen. I think they want to do away with an unpleasant witness. And have an innocent man incarcerated. - Good to know. I'm really sorry for the guy. What a waste. They arrested the wrong fellow. Then I'm sitting pretty. Concietta, alas, is sticking by her statement. Things would be easier if she said she was mistaken. She loves this man. Justice will triumph. Depends on your viewpoint. Concietta is on the wrong side. One can't survive long there. Come here, asshole! Now you get what you deserve! Everything OK? - Any news? Giovanni bumped off the prison director. Gino helped him. He provided the knife. What's going to happen to Giovanni now? We needn't worry about him. But what'|| his bitch do now? She's an unfortunate eyewitness in my opinion. I have the task of informing you that Giovanni killed the director. I don't believe it. He stabbed him. Things look bad. That'|| get him at least 15 years. I'll plead that it's an emotional crime. They'll nail him for the cops. One could also plead insanity. Then he ends up in the nut house. Giovanni's mother has also died. So much disaster in the family. All she had to put up with! Such misery! What misfortune! What's it all in aid of! Promise you'll protect Concietta from the pigs. Promise? You're my only friend. I trust you. Do we have to spend the whole night here? - I don't know. I request a hearing. Please have some patience. We have a serious problem with the motor. Maybe we have to spend the whole night here. - Oh no! That's outrageous! What will I tell my wife? - What are you doing in the bus? I often take this route, but have never seen you before? It's none of your business. I only asked. I like to talk with fellow passengers. It's hardly a crime. Who are you? - That's irrelevant. Iwas in prison until yesterday. I was innocent. That's why I'm out again. But my friend Giovanni is in deep shit. You know him? - I think he's innocent He stabbed the director. The double police murder will also be covered by the trial. He'll get life. You're a friend of his? - Sure. - I don't trust you Why? - You have evil eyes. The breakdown cannot be fixed today, get it? Here, from me. Shut your trap, or you'll get it. - OK. I knew it. They can't fix it. - Attention please! The bus has engine trouble. We have to spend the night here. There's a house over there, where we can spend the night. I'll lead the way. - You didn't want to believe me. I'm not going to follow him. There's something about him. He's harmless. - I'm listening to my instinct. Come on in. - I said it straight away. Don't you want to come in? - No, I'm staying here. - Me too. Where're you heading? - Milan. I've got a secretarial job. But only in a week's time. Or I'd now have a big problem. One must expect coincidences. I could keep you warm tonight. - I'm warm enough. When that guy leaves, we can amuse ourselves. Only if it's what you want. Could you move away? I need the space here! You'd sleep better over there. She fell straight into the washing machine. You want some? It'll warm you up inside. Try it. Tastes good. Just keep on drinking. Yes, jerk it off. Not so loud! How about fucking a horny old dear? I'll show her to you. She knows what men want. - How's it going, handsome? You'll have a beautiful night together. This drink sweetens the hours. Drink this. It's good for you A room for us. The breakdown was a bonus. Want more to drink? You're a beautiful woman. I really like you. You're amazing and so horny. You're just my type. Should we fuck? - I think I'll go back over. But it's boring there. Stay here. This is your big opportunity. Kiss me. Where's my boyfriend? - In a room down there. You're a good fucker. Fuck sake, it's cold here. I've seen better rooms. Come on in, there's a bed here. You can sit down there. I think you need a real man. That's not for you to judge. I feel great. You can't solve my problem. I can't come to terms with starting a new life. I miss Giovanni. - Losing one's sweetheart is quite painful. You know what it's all about. You've been following me. That's a trick with the bus. What do you really want? Be honest. What should I do? Forget him. Start a new life. I know prison life. But you're free. It'll take a while. You have to be brave now. Giovanni will probably have to spend the rest of his life in prison. He'll be old when he gets out. I can't stop thinking about it. Prison isn't all that bad. He'll find his feet. Think of yourself. - How can I do that? You were in there yourself. It's a very suspicious place. Why were you locked up? I may have been in prison. But I'd never harm you. I simply want to help you to forget Giovanni a little. A toast to Giovanni. C'mon, there's enough of it there. You just want to make me drunk. What do you think I am? - Exactly that, you bastard. You're amazingly moist. I want to kiss you. You drive me crazy. You have gorgeous skin. That gives me another idea. Stick it in. I'm about to come, you dirty bitch. I'll give you all my cream. Where were you? There she is. So fast? Remarkable. - That's me. Go on, get to work. Now we'll close the case. Hello, sweety. Do you recognise me? You can't remember? That's good. I really appreciate that. I hate traitors. But you're not one. I'm sending you on a long trip. You won't double-cross me. How's it going? - Fine, thanks. I'm supposed to give you a letter from Giovanni. He was convicted yesterday. I'm really sorry. I wasn't much of a help. I'm grateful to you. - We could appeal. Things aren't looking rosy. I've had threats from the mafia. Don't think I'm a coward. But I'm scared. They wanted to kill me yesterday. I was lucky.- Why on earth?! I want to see him again. - Forget it. He's doomed. I can't help you any further. The case is too dangerous. Just let the whole thing rest. Please leave me alone. What an idiot. Don't hit her from close range. Amateur! - Don't hassle me! We'll try again then! You only screwed her! Why didn't you do it? It wasn't my job. You have to make up for the error. Don Rafaello won't be pleased with that. - Now I've had enough! Calm down. We'll discuss it. I've got an idea. That's the solution. Physiotherapy starts tomorrow. That'|| get you back on your feet. You're making progress. - Will I recover? With your strong will, yes. You simply have to believe it. She's improving every day too. Good night. Dear Concietta. I miss you so. I love you, but I'm sad. Maybe I'll never see you again. I'm so sorry for everything. Destiny dealt us a cruel blow. They gave me a life sentence. Forget me. Why don't you leave me alone? I haven't asked much of you recently, hmm? You don't look too good these days. As if you care less. - That's not true. You're ungrateful. That makes the family sad. Find out where Concietta is. - Not that, please. How can one betray the family in such a manner? Don't talk to me of betrayal. Do what I tell you! I don't want to get nasty with you. It's simple. Find out which room she's in. Then you let me know, OK? Have you no conscience? - No. I'm a traitor. I don't need a conscience. That's a hindrance. Bad, eh? Let's enjoy the hours we spend together. I've no idea how you got into such a mess. I'll compensate for my mistakes. How on earth? Kill the tart. Or you'll end up in the harbour! You missed her, from 2 metres! What kind of idiot are you?! You make me look like a fool! Better off shooting yourself. I just can't understand it. She should be dead by now. I never miss. - Me neither. If you don't sort it out, I'll shoot you. You made a mistake. I hate mistakes. Maybe she'll withdraw her statement? Are you taking the piss? She's in touch with the press. They all know. Clear it up. Or else you're dead. That'd be a pity. I like you. What are you doing here? Take a seat. Why did you come? You don't care how I'm doing. Withdraw your statement. You're no match for those guys. Testify in favour of the mafia. - No way. I'll tell them what really happened, for Giovanni's sake. He doesn't stand a chance. What's going on? - Rosalie called round. Come out! Do I really have to? - You bet. Are you wanking again? Are you mad? - You're mad. Sorry. Didn't mean it that way. Any developments? - Good evening. - Wait outside. How's she doing? - She's sharing the room with 5 women. Good to know. - She's watched round-the-clock. Except when she's with the doc. She's in the Our Lady ward. 2nd floor Room 234. Across the hall, 2nd on the right. Good work. I'm satisfied with you. Excellent information. Do you want to have it off again? Careful! We're moving you to a different room. It's a question of discipline. Nobody will be in the area when the time comes. - Good lad. Here's your pay- Can I have a cigarette? It wouldn't do you any good. Make an exception. - I'll turn a blind eye. Why are you sitting on my bed? I'm here to protect you. No worries. Everything's under control. Hopefully. Hello, my friend. -What's up? Can you do me a favour? - What then? Don Rafaello wants us to sort out a problem for him. Which problem? - No questions. What must I do? - It's simple. Distract the policemen at 10pm. The rest takes care of itself. What if they get wind of it. That's my problem. I'm on top of things. Don't worry. Sometimes one has to help. You scratch their back, they'll scratch yours. Get it? I'll do it. Where's Concietta? We've no time, say it! Somebody's shooting! I'll protect you. Just let them come, the bastards! They're going to shoot me. You're uncler police protection. But we'll carry out our assignment. Do you want to die with the tart? You're the only one still alive. Leave me alone! Come over here please? Why're you taking down my details? - You're not allowed to park here. You made a mistake? I'm only doing my duty. I died while executing my duty and survived. Do you know who I am? - All parking culprits are the same. I was a prison director. Get in touch with the chief of police. Come visit me. That would make me really happy. I can't hush up this affair any longer. They're already discussing this in the highest circles. That hardly exceeds your authority? I can't operate within the law. We define the law around here. The family wants us all in the same boat. This affair is to be sorted out. The boy has lost his cool. He'll make up for the mistake. We also made mistakes when we were young. I'm behind my boys. They always did a good job, up to now. They're off to the hospital to kill her. It happened on my patch. I accept the responsibility. How could that happen? That has repercussions for all the families here. Even the Justice Minister has gotten involved. - I know. You also made mistakes. The missing heroin consignment. What's all the fuss about? Take some action. Or all bets are off. I just had a chat with the judge. The case will be handled in accordance with our wishes. You just have to liquidate those pushing the case. Understand? Here, you fucking pig! May I go to the disco? - No, not with these characters! They're all criminals in there. - You think everybody's a criminal. May I go? - You can't go out tonight. You're staying put! Wasn't a prison director murdered last week? That's what the paper says. It was all just a setup. - I want to go to the disco. Can I take the car? Sure. Don't drink and drive! Is that your son? - Yes. Takes after his dad. I don't mean to be curious. But you look like the murdered director. We had to do it like that. The knife was tampered with. Let's talk about something else. We wanted to make someone disappear for all eternity. What's happening? - Keep moving. Leave the room! - I'm already out of here. I only asked. Nice of you to visit. I need a wank. lf you want, you can lend a hand. I like to watch. Show me! Go on! Do it! Show me how horny you are! I'm so horny. You've got fine tits. Play with your cunt. Rub it on the rest. That's so sexy. Suck my horny cock. Now that's what I call a cock? Stick it right into your cunt. Kiss me. You're much better at that than issuing parking tickets. Beautiful, wet cunt. I'll come all over your face. Great asshole. Rub your tits. That turns me on. Come on, swallow it. Call round whenever you want. What's up? - Father didn't want me to go to the disco. I think he doesn't like you. - No. You're not the only cause of my problems. They just don't know realise that their daughter has grown-up. Your parents are pretty stupid. - No they're not. Assert yourself! - Dad's particularly strict. Probably because he's a judge. You'll never be an adult at this rate. I don't stand a chance with parents like that. I'll show you what a real man's like. Shit! Got to get up earlier, if you want to finish me off! Declare it a top priority! Honey. - Howre you doing? - Fine. - Why are you calling? I want to go to the cinema this afternoon. To what kind of cinema? I want to go to the Rex. - Maurizio will protect and accompany you. Enjoy the movie. You may accompany my wife to the cinema. You can rely on me. I'll mind her. If needs be, I can explain the plot to her. It won't be easy to protect you, my boy. You weren't here for ages. Sit. Thanks. Why do they want to get me? It wasn't my fault that the bloke lost the head. I did everything he asked. You overstepped the mark. No capital crimes without my consent. I only tried to save what could be saved. Other people are of a different opinion. I'd try to spare you. I know you since you were a kid. - That's no help. Should I kill myself? That's no joking matter. - Somebody tried to kill me. Someone from our family. I was faster. That's my boy. That's why I like you. Don't pee in your pants. Stand up for yourself! Anything else would be a letdown. I can't help you. I'm no longer in charge. Maybe there's another option. - Which? Have some plastic surgery on your face. That won't be easy. I'll arrange a passport and take you out of the country. I'm eternally grateful. - No problem. You don't seem to enjoy the film. Want to leave? We're in a porn cinema! Did you just see that? You knew where we were going, right? When do I get my passport? Howre you arranging the operation? The prison director survived the assassination attempt. The judge withdrew the charges. They're investigating our family. Don Rafaello forgives you as you didn't betray the family. How come? He says you owe him a favour. You should do a job for him. If you succeed, you're rehabilitated. The director knows of the judiciary's conspiracies. He's threatening to squeal. He has to be liquidated, fast. You should do it. You are to restore the family's honour. You should thank Don Rafaello. I understand. I kill the director. Then I'm back in the family, right? Ifl can count on that, I'll do it. I've got a surprise. That's something else! Kiss me, honeybunch. Was that it? Don't you want to give me more? Don't be so bitchy. That's better. I'll get you. Give it a good hard blow. I'm about to spray spunk! |~\ \ \ \ i - \ a Have a seat. You want something from my father? - Where is he? I'd rather tell him myself. - What do you want from us? Don't ask silly questions. I have to speak to him immediately. Should I jog your memory? For the last time. Where is he? I don't want to have to kill his son. You're too young. Where is he? You're the traitor. - Correct. I want to put things straight. Where were you? I was waiting for you. I must find father. See you tomorrow. - What's going on? - I can't say. My father's in danger. Go home. You're safe there. Tell me what's going on. No. Do what I say. What are you looking at? You got a problem? No, everything's fine. Let me know, if you've been up to mischief. Tell me! Are they after me?! Why did you destroy our family? - It self-destructed. Let us live in peace. Why do you do the likes of that? I only kill to order. No matter who it is. Why us? - It's your turn. It's a family affair. The murders leave you cold? You're a low-down traitor. I want to fuck, not talk. That's for my husband. Are you crazy?! - And that's for Concietta. And that's to ensure that you never return. Don't do it. Suicide won't change anything. You have to continue to live for the truth. I absolve you of your guilt. Continue to live for the sake ofjustice. Tell them all. You got vengeance for Giovanni and me. Live in peace. I love you, Rosalie. I really blow my top with that kind of shit. Don't speak of our maestro like that. Salieri is the greatest director. He knows exactly what's going on. Or do you think someone from Naples can't make a good movie? You're in great danger. Inspector Paolo will mind you. I'll ask you a few questions, if you're feeling better. No worries. It won't happen again. You survived the operation. You'll pull through. We're doing everything for you. You'll stay another 2 or 3 weeks. Then you can go home. You were snatched from the jaws of death. Signor Ricarta? - Yes. - Call for you. - Thanks. Sorry? - It's me. - No way. I'm eating with my wife. Tomorrow in the office. - I don't care what you two do. Not a good idea right now. Where are you? - Outside the restaurant. Either you come out, or I go in. OK. See you in a second. Honey, a business meeting. I can't put it off. I'll be right back. I don't want to eat just yet. I'm here! - Let's leave this place. We can't be seen together. You're causing enough trouble. - Hang on! No way to treat me! What are you drinking? - Whiskey. - Two whiskeys please. Calling me while I'm eating with my wife was not part of the deal. To hell with our deal. Leave her! It's not that simple. Give me time. I'll sort it out. She owns the company. I'd be broke. - Make a decision. Or I'll take things into my own hands. Forgiven. I've had enough. - The food's fantastic. I like to come here. Do you have dessert? This idiot is leaving me sitting here on my own. When I pull out my cock, you'll become delirious. Look at your one! What's she up to? Pretty lady. Such a rush? Hang on a second. Going all out. Typical Joschka. You're so beautiful. - Leave me alone, wanker. Don't hassle me. Why so bitchy? - Try to think of something better. Go after her. She's hot. Stick mine in too. Independent women really turn me on. - Get out of here! I don't want your company! - How about my naked company? Idiot! - You're so sad. Whereas you're so pretty. Just hear me out. - You're stubborn. - True. Are you deaf, or why are you still here?! You're not my type! Now disappear! You're making a mistake with me. I fell in love with you at first sight. You're my queen. Let our lips meet. Come on. Can you feel my hot breath? Your kisses cause my whole body to convulse. Can you feel the earth move? Now that's fulfilment. Your mouth's hot like a volcano. Ancl I'll spurt like a volcano. Keep going! You're driving me crazy! I love your hot mouth. Unbelievable! You're the answer to my dreams. I knew we'd get along. I love your tits. Fantastic, your monster tits. Pussy is the icing on the cake. Fuck me! You're addicted now. Take everything you can get. Good evening. - Hello. All OK? Did she have a good sleep? -Yes. - Then I don't want to wake her. She slept right through. - Here's her money. Thanks a lot. - No problem. ls my husband there? - No. Haven't seen him yet today. Why didn't you wait for me? - I waited long enough You're nothing but a cheap tart. Me, a tart? That's the meanest thing you could say to me. You know how sensitive lam. Kiss my ass! I saw what you did. I married a slut! I could kill you! I'll never forgive you! Mama! Everything OK? You had a nasty nightmare. Are you stupid? - Will you be finished soon? It's the crankshaft. It'll take 1-2 hours. - That's long. Didn't you want to go on holidays with Concietta? Il have to finish this off. Or the old guy will kill me. I'd love to go with her. But who'll fix this heap? I will. I've no plans. You can go. I have to be able to rely on you. - You can. Tonight I'll fuck the wife of my boss. That's quite a prospect. Hello. Jump in. - I've been waiting a whole hour! Where were you? Now that's a fine start. I'm sorry. I spoil you too. - It's OK. The papers are not in order. - Why not? - It's not your photo. Pull the other one. - Can we go? - One moment. The papers, please. - I left them at home. Have you any ID? - I forgot my passport. What's wrong with the papers? - Come with me to the station. Holy shit! What have you done there?! Enough of your liP! We have to stop. My husband could come. - He's gone bowling. He won't be back before 12. Let's keep going. Don't be worried. Holy shit. Let's get out of here! Where's Giovanni? - He drove off. - Does he drive a white Suzuki? Yes. What has happened? - He shot two policemen. I've taken on the case. The press know nothing yet. We have a suspect. We'll keep you posted. Here's Giovanni Santini's file. He has a long record. Car theft, drug offences. Cannabis. Fraud. Acquitted due to lack of evidence. 1 year prison for pimping. Sentenced to 3 years on March 6th, 1993. I think he's guilty. - Bring the girl in. This way please. Apology for the bad treatment. Two colleagues were murdered. Tell me what happened. We have nothing to do with it. It was a routine check. Two men were already there. They shot the policemen. That's right. She said her boyfriend shot at the policemen. Witnesses say the two men left earlier. They were still alive then. That's a lie. The men shot the policemen. Why didn't they kill you too? Cop killers don't like witnesses. That's illogical! I can only tell you what I saw. Why do you suspect us? We just wanted a good weekend, not a murder story. I'm only doing my duty. Maybe you're telling the truth. Your boyfriend's the main suspect. Get a good lawyer. Am I speaking with Magnioli, the lawyer? - Who is this? Concietta Licarta. Please take on my boyfriend's case. We're in big trouble. - Do you know what time it is? I was working the whole night. I only discuss serious cases at home. It's difficult. My boyfriend's said to have killed two policemen. You're joking. Something's wrong there. - Please help me! Come to my office in 1 hour. - Thank you. I can't take anymore of your babbling. - I'm losing my mind. I'll be out in three months. Then I'm off to a brothel. Make yourself comfortable for the next 30 years. What's happened? - They arrested Giovanni. That can't be true! - It is. That's so horrible! Shit! Calm down. They'll clear it up. Sit down and tell what's going on. What's happened? - I can't take anymore. They can't convict me. I didn't do it. They'll find the 2 who did it. Then I'm free to go. I'm innocent. What a nightmare. - Most of them are innocent. Until they've been convicted. You are charged with the murder of policemen. They make short work of that? Things look bad for you. What have you been up to? You look terrible. I'll do what I can. I first have to become familiar with the case. Only then can I act. Here, from your mother. For you. She sends her best. She couldn't come. Stop crying. That won't help. It doesn't cheer me up, seeing you like that. I know you didn't do it. We'll get you out of here. He's the best lawyer. He'll expose the guilty ones. Visiting time is over. Did you say everything? That's enough for the next month. Do it! - You're a pig! Why are you tormenting us? - You can't afford to do that! Looks like solitary confinement. I take care of my guests. You bastard, I'll kill you! If they can prove it was Giovanni, he'll never come out. He didn't do it. He's not a killer. He's my friend. I believe him. Where does Giovanni's girl live?! What do you want with her? If she testifies against us, we'll kill her. That's not what you want. So then, where does she live? Hurry up, or do you want a beating? Or maybe your family has an accident? What's her number? Sorry? - Say nothing to the cops, get it?! If you do, then you and your family are history. Hello? Who is it? Have mercy on my husband. He won't survive it. We even have a child. I'm not a monster. Your husband got 4 years. He dealed heroin with the kids in the schoolyard. Here he behaves like a pig. What should I do? He has a heart problem. He'll die. Do you enjoy torturing people? I can't take this rubbish. I'm extending the solitary by three months. Don't do that to us! He won't withstand that. These women have a sob-story every day. But he always behaved well. All of them angels. I know the story. He attacked me. I'm a warder. He'll die. - Not that fast. I won't accept any pressure. We need your help, eminence. We have a big problem. Of what sort? They say that Giovanni shot two policemen. But Giovanni didn't do it. Now he's in the slammer and they're using him as a scapegoat. You're sure he's innocent? Otherwise I wouldn't be here. Put in a good word for him. That's a bad situation. - Only you can help. Your word counts for a lot. Otherwise Giovanni's doomed. It would kill my sister. I'll see what I can do. - Thanks
