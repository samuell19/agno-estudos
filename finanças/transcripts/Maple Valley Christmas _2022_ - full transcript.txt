This is my favorite story. It's the story about two people so in love that anything seemed possible. Those people were my great grandparents, who in 1931, with nothing more than the clothes on their backs, crossed this country in search of a new life. And when they got here, it looked nothing like it does now. There was no trees, no barn, no house. And with just a dream, they started planting maple. And eventually my grandparents took over, planted more, and same with my mother. And now, four generations later, Maple Valley Farm is the largest maple syrup farm in Montana. And terrible joke alert, but when I am feeling sappy, I like to remind myself that patience and hard work begets sweetness. And speaking of sweetness, maybe you wanna gift some for Christmas. So awkward segue and shameless plug for our popular barrel aged maple syrup and other delicious maple sourced products. Now, if you'll follow me, we will make our way to the gift shop. (gentle Christmas music) Our wonderful ranch hands, Margot and Ollie, are here to help you. And if you need a Christmas tree, be sure to visit our neighbors at the Fernandez Tree Lot. Just make a left out of the driveway. You can't miss it. And don't forget, Maple Valley Farm hosts an unforgettable week of Christmas activities. We have a giant tree lighting. We've got photos with Santa, a Maple Christmas Fair, and the not to miss prime rib sleigh ride dinner. So check out our website, or just pester Margo. (gentle Christmas music) How's it going? Pretty good. I'm just about finish the books. I just need the sales from the last few days of the quarter, and then we can go over into the numbers. - Ooh. - What you got there? Oh, we're packaging and gift wrapping for The Maple Shoppe. Wait, we already need more? Business is good. So is your husband, because I brought you guys some peppermint bark. My hero. - Mwah. - I know. (bright music) (Trevor chuckles) (teacher 1 speaking Italian) (teacher 2 speaking Italian) How long will you be staying? (teacher 2 speaking Italian) (Ina speaking Italian) (Trevor speaking Italian) (Ina speaking Italian) Mom, what are you saying? Something about a family meeting. When did you learn Italian? Oh, I spent a lot of time with your mother. - Uh-huh. - Trevor's right. And I do wanna have a family meeting. Don't worry. No, everything's okay. I just have some news to share. Well, it's not gonna be shocking, because as you know, I've been pulling back a little from the farm, you know, working less. Oh, we've noticed. (Ina laughs) And you also know that I've been thinking about retiring and I've decided it's finally time. I have loved every minute of my life here of raising you two here, working alongside you. I mean, it's, it's been a dream come true. And, uh, now I'm, I'm, I'm ready for a new chapter. And you're ready to take the reins. You know, my mother passed this land onto me and now I get to pass it on to you two, to run together. This place doesn't run without you. Of course it does. But you're our glue. Oh. I know that this is gonna be a big change, but I also know that you two, you got this. We're gonna be partners. Partners. Aw, we're gonna miss you, boss. [Ina] Okay. (bright music) Hey, buddy. Phoenix file? - You bet. - How's the old man's mood? Oh, you know how he gets over the holidays. I do, and every Christmas I'm hoping that this is the year he's gonna change. That would be a Christmas miracle. Oh, yeah. Dad, looking good. New tie? All right, let's talk about the Phoenix property. So after reviewing the file, it looks like, well, there's a lot of good options for the land next to the retail space. Affordable housing, community garden, a park. Show me the numbers. We're still, we're still working on the numbers. So we're basically not meeting our timeline. Aaron, lean on them. Dad, it's 10 days till Christmas. Everyone's in holiday mode. Okay, I'll check in on Monday. Can you set up a call? Yes, but just to remind you, I'm out of the office starting tonight. Heading home for the holidays. What do you do for Christmas, Connor? Oh, my whole extended family comes to town. There's lots of cooking, lots of eating. Someone brings up old drama. Multiple people cry. Beautiful family traditions. What about you two? What do they Davenport's do for Christmas? - I golf. - I ski. (cellphone ringing) Steve, it's the real estate agent who called earlier. Are you buying another property? Hopefully. I'm glad I'm kept in the loop. By the way, Dad, I'm out of the office at noon tomorrow. I'm going to Aspen. So you're leaving the office early. Long vacation. Must be nice. I'll be working remotely. It's fine. I work hard, so you, my son, can play hard. ♪ Santa Claus won't make me happy ♪ ♪ With a toy on Christmas Day ♪ ♪ I just want you for my own ♪ ♪ More than you could ever know ♪ ♪ Make my wish come true ♪ You're early. First one here gets to pick the music. Those are the rules. Well, the joke's on you, because I would've picked this anyway. ♪ Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas ♪ So it's pretty crazy about Mom, huh? I mean, we knew it was coming, but still it's a big change. Yeah, I know. But sometimes change is good, even taking some risks. Are you saying I don't take risks? I'm not not saying it. Are you sure you're okay with us being partners? Of course. Why? 'Cause we're sisters. Yeah, but we'll be good business partners. I mean, you have the MBA, I have the technical know how. We have complimentary skills. Yeah, plus the farm runs like clockwork, so everything will be fine. Exactly. (thoughtful music) [Ina] Oh, girls, look what Andres gave us. Just a way of saying thank you for sending so much business my way. Oh, nice try, honey, but you gift us a tree every year. (Chuckles) Well, it's always my pleasure. And this will be the last year as, uh... Well, the day you've all been waiting for has arrived. I spoke with my sister this morning. Everybody's finally on board. Wait, you're selling your property? Well, you're just so happy to not have me as your neighbor any longer. No, no. We, we will miss you. And we will come visit you in Florida, especially in the winter. You know how much your land means to our family. And I know how long you've wanted it back. We will have to discuss it first, so of course. So I just wanna give you a heads up about a little issue. If it were up to me, I would sell the property directly to you. But it's my sister's land too. And they want a public sale. So you're listing it. Yes, but it's just a formality. Of course, no, we understand. Alright, good. Well, I gotta get going. [Ina] Okay. Thanks. Don't worry, the lands as good as ours. Who's gonna want a property in the middle of nowhere Montana? (bright music) Okay, thanks so much. Yeah, you have a great holiday season as well. Okay, bye-bye. Aaron. Hey, pal. No, no, no, no. Whatever my dad has sent you here to tell me, no. My flight to Aspen is in an hour. Yeah, about that. Teeny weeny change of plans. Your dad needs you to look at a property in Maple Valley, Montana tomorrow. What? Maple Valley, why does that ring a bell? And why does this have to happen on my vacation? Because the property just got listed. And supposedly, your dad has had his eye on this location for years. And you know how he gets when he wants something. Oh yeah, yeah, I do. And right now what he wants is for me to not go on vacation. But he always gets what he wants, right? (drill whirring) (bright music) How's it looking? [Ollie] Good. (bright music continues) I think this one can use a new tap. We've got two old tap holes here. Maybe let her heal. (thoughtful music) (thoughtful music continues) (thoughtful music continues) (thoughtful music continues) Oh, no, Archie got out again. Better go check the trail for him. Do you want me to go? [Erica] No, I got it. You two get outta here? Hey, there, boy. Hi. You lost? Where'd you come from? I'm gonna get on your back, alright? We're gonna get you home. (Aaron straining) (Aaron clicking tongue) (hooves shuffling) Come on, Archie, where are you? (Erica sighs) (hooves plodding) (gentle music) There you are. Archie. So that's your name. Gotta stop running off, buddy. Thanks for finding him. Pleasure. (gentle music) Surprised you're having such an easy time with him. I grew up around horses. Anyway, thanks for saving the day. What are you doing out in these woods anyway? I was, I was just driving by and I saw Archie here looking like a lost puppy. I figured somebody must be looking for him. I need to find my car. Do you know where a Til-Tilden Lane is? Yeah, uh... You know, why don't I get Archie back and I'll walk you. It's the least I can do. Sure. I'm Erica, by the way. Aaron. Where am I? You're on my family's maple syrup farm. Weird. What is it? It's just familiar. Well. (gentle music) So this is a maple farm. Where's all the syrup and the lumberjacks with the flannels carrying the big buckets? Oh, well, the maple syrup doesn't exist yet, 'cause the sap is still in the trees. It doesn't flow until late winter, early spring. Then we'll harvest the sap, boil it down, grade it, bottle it. As for the lumberjacks, they're probably with the other outdated ideas about farming. This farm's run by my mom. Actually, now it's run by my sister and me. So you're female lumberjacks? Lumberjackies? (thoughtful music) (thoughtful music continues) What, what is this? Oh, it's part of our Christmas themed horseback ride. We take groups to the candy cane forest, past the twirly swirling gumdrop plains to here, the mistletoe meadow. It's a social media favorite. I know why this is familiar to me. I've been here before. It was a family vacation. I was probably seven or eight years old. Is that possible? Yeah. My mom or grandma would've been your guide. Wow. What a small world. Come one. So this is your job. You take people out on horseback ride to bring 'em to the mistletoe so they can kiss. Yeah, it's, it's what it says on my Linkedln. So, I obviously do other things than that, but yes, part of my job does entail trying not to watch happy couples kiss while fielding questions from strangers about my dating status. Oh, I'm sure that never gets old. No, never. I love twice a day, five days a week, people asking me why am I single? Sure it's tough though, to date here. You know, it's a small town, small pool. But you can date tourists. Yes, but I don't date the tourists. We're almost back. (gentle music) (hooves plodding) So you're from out of town? Yeah, San Diego. Not too far. Why you out here? Just, uh, just here for business. Just passing through. It's a nice hat. Where can I get something like this? You don't get a cowboy hat. You earn it. Said your car's on Tilden Lane? Yeah, yeah, it's, uh, it's right past the turn off. It's not too far. I'll walk you. Oh, there you are, hun. Eggnog's ready? Mom? Ah, who do we have here? Hi, I'm Aaron. Archie got out, Aaron found him. Oh, well, let us thank you with some eggnog. Okay. Come on in, Aaron. This is my younger daughter, Heidi and her husband, Trevor. This here is Aaron. He's our honorary ranch hand for the day. Archie got out and he found him. Oh, hi. - Nice to meet you. - Howdy. Would you like that eggnog now? I am definitely ready for that eggnog. So were you guys doing something? No, we're just hanging out. - Mm-hmm. - Just voluntarily hanging out with relatives for fun? That's what we do. I've heard of this, but I've, I've actually never, - I never witnessed it. - Pretty shocking to me the first time I did it too. (all laughing) You know, this is incredible eggnog. Oh, thank you. Old family recipe. A very old one. My great-grandma perfected it. We've toned down the bourbon. Winter's used to be colder. (all laughing) So, Aaron, where are you coming from? Born and raised in San Diego. Just visiting Maple Valley? Yeah, I'm just, um, passing through on my way to Aspen. If you're still around tomorrow, why don't you come to the tree lighting? Starts at dusk. Yeah. (Clears throat) If I'm still here tomorrow, I will definitely be there. (gentle music) Wow. It's so beautiful. And freezing. Hey, you don't have to walk me. Oh, uh, if you're sure. (gentle music) You just had some snow in your hair. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) Wow, okay. I'm so sorry. I have no idea what just came over me. Don't apologize. (wind rustling) Uh, Tilden Lane? Oh yeah, it's, it's just behind the, the parking lot. One more thing. Andres Fernandez property? Okay, it starts just at the end of the tree line there. Why? It's the reason I'm here. I'm a real estate developer and we're looking to buy his land. Excuse me? I work for a real estate development company. No, I know, I, I heard you. Wanna know why I'm single? I always pick the wrong men. (perplexed music) (door slams) (perplexed music continues) (no audio) (bright music) So what happened with Mr. Real Estate development guy? What? Nothing, what, what do you mean? She means, you walked him to his car and then returned looking like you just stuck your finger in a socket. I told you, that was because I just found out he might bid against us for the property. - Mm-hmm. - Why is that such a shock? We knew there'd be other bidders. I mean, not like him. (Heidi clears throat) Something definitely happened between you two. Fine. It stays between us. I sort of kissed him. Seriously? That is so unlike you. I know. Believe me. Well, how was it? It was amazing. It was like we had to kiss, like it couldn't not happen. Well, that's exciting. No, it's not exciting. It's not anything. Why not? Because, if we get the property, I'll never see him again. And if he gets the property, I'll never want to see him again. Listen, we should talk about the Fernandez land. What about it? I'm not sure if we should bid on it. I think that the money could be better used somewhere else. But that was always the plan. Buy the land, plant more maple. Yeah, but plans change. Especially business plans. Let's discuss it with Mom. (gentle music) So instead of using the money to buy more land and maple, which takes 30 to 40 years to tap, we could use the money to build the business now. Buy our own sugaring house, vertically integrate. We could even go retail. I mean, people love our syrup. Why be limited to a gift store? We could sell in grocery stores. Except we can't sell more syrup, if we don't have more trees. Okay, well, if we need more trees, then we buy more land later. Except the land's available now. We can buy other land later. But this is the land we want. But that is an emotional decision. Girls, there's no right choice here. I can't get involved. You're partners now, you gotta figure it out. There's gonna be lots of big choices and you're gonna have to find a way to make them together. You're gonna have to be patient. Communicate with each other. You'll be fine. Trevor, can you please explain it? No, no. Not happening, mm-mm. Okay, let's just table this for now. Focus on the Christmas tree lighting. (gentle music) Hey. (gentle music continues) Don't worry, she'll come around. Oh, honey, I am, I am not worried. But if I was worried, wouldn't be about the land. (gentle music) (bright Christmas music) Hey. I, uh, didn't know if I was still invited after you kissed me and then in a totally bewildering twist got upset and stormed off. Hm. Sorry. Apology accepted. You wanna, you wanna tell me what's, what's up? My family has been on this land for nearly a century. Both this property and the Fernandez land, which we used to own. When we came here, there was nothing. And we planted and we built and we turned it into what it is now. But there were hard times and it was bad weather. Sap didn't flow, machinery broke, and we needed money. So we sold what became the Fernandez land. We've been waiting 30 years to buy it back. (sighs) Wow. (Aaron sighs) I wish you would've told me that earlier. Look, I mean, there's facets of the land that weren't ideal. I had my doubts, and maybe that's a sign. I'll just, I'll tell my dad it's a no go. Really? Yeah, no problem. Okay, I, I'm very grateful and definitely not trying to change your mind, but you're sure? Yes, yeah, no, the land, it wasn't right for us. And obviously it means a lot to you. (bright music) Now, if you excuse me, I, uh, I'll go call my dad. (bright music) (phone ringing) Yep. Hey, Dad. Did you put our offer in yet? No, I didn't, didn't put the offer in. I've actually changed my mind, we're not gonna bid. Why not? Well, there's a lot of, lot of reasons. Lots of reasons. Um, you know, the, the, the land isn't really build ready and, uh, we'd have to dig more wells, run more power. We'd have to also change the zoning to get out of its current use. Oh, I see what's going on. You don't want to bid because you don't wanna stay out there while I close the deal and send the surveyors. You want to go to Aspen? No, that is not the reason, (Aaron sighs) The reason I don't wanna bid is because the neighbors want the land. And? And it's not worth our time or energy. Working isn't worth your energy? Then what is Aaron? Because this is your job. This is our company. Your company. Okay, well, it, it will be yours one day, right? Well, if it's gonna be my company, then I don't want this property in my portfolio. Why, because the neighbors want it? You know what? You give up too easy. Look, Dad, this land is not right for us. There are a lot of other options in Montana. I'll find you something else. I gotta go. No, no, no, wait, ah. (jolly music) It's done. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm, I'm a little sad though that we're not gonna be neighbors. Well, you wouldn't have lived on the property anyway, right? Yeah, I probably would've turned it into a vacation community or... That would ruin it. It's quiet here, it's pristine. We've avoided development for so long. Hopefully you've avoided it again. So tell me about this, what, Montana, big sky, big tree? Oh, I will have you know this is not just any big tree. This was my grandparents' first Christmas tree in Montana. My grandma got a live tree and planted it here and then every year they would decorate it and have a little tree lighting. It's now a very big tree lighting. You're lucky, my family never did any of this stuff. Why, what did your family usually do? Oh, expensive gifts, emotional stonewalling, Bailey's on cornflakes. It's a heartwarming time of year. Well, I think it's special. You can join us. Okay, everyone. It's time. (joyful Christmas music) - Right, hey guys, hi. - Hi. Oh, we're hugging. - Yeah. - Yeah, we're huggers, but we don't have to. No, I, I like a, I like a hug. Okay. And you know what? You have to come by the gift shop. I'm gonna give you a bottle of that eggnog that you like so much. Oh, thank you, that's, that's very thoughtful. [Trevor] Alrighty, do the honors. No, I'm not doing the honors anymore. It's Erica and Heidi's turn now. Or maybe Erica and Aaron could do it. Oh, I'm sure Aaron - doesn't want. - That's great. (soft joyful Christmas music) All right. (cellphone ringing) - So- - I am so sorry. I just have to, so sorry. (cellphone ringing) I have to get this, just be... Connor, not a good time. It's not a good time either for me to have your dad calling me on my vacation, about as calm as an atomic bomb. It, it's about the phone call? Yes. And to cut your dad's very long and mildly terrifying tirade short, he wants to buy it and has upped our available bidding price. Okay, okay. I'm, I'm, I'll handle it. Keep me in the loop. Bye. I am so sorry. Okay everyone, it's countdown time. [All] Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. - Five. - On one - you can pull the switch. - Four. Three. Two. One. (switch thudding) (lights buzzing) (all cheering) ("Joy to the World") (all clapping) ("Joy to the World" continues) [Aaron] Wow. ("Joy to the World" continues) Aaron, if I didn't say it properly before, thank you. I know you gave up something big for my family, and I know I don't know you that well, but you're obviously a really good guy, so thank you so much. My pleasure. (magical music) (no audio) It doesn't have to be this property. I'll find us something else. Do the right thing here. I am doing the right thing. I'm doing the right thing for us. This property means something to the neighbors. Yeah, and it means something to me too. I mean something more than money. (sighing) Dad, you sent me here to oversee this and I'm telling you, it's not the right decision. Well, luckily for the both of us, you don't make the decisions. Letting this go is the right thing to do and we're gonna do it. I gotta go. Talk tomorrow. (uplifting music) (door creaking) (door slams) [Erica] Hey. We are outselling last year, we need more of everything. Maybe we should plant more trees. Heidi becoming partners is gonna have growing pains. It's normal. We just gotta get through it. I know, I'm just asking you to consider what's best for the business. I am considering it. I'm just asking you to do the same. Ladies, I already told you I'm not getting involved. You're gonna have to figure this out together. Not only because you're partners, but because I won't always be here. You won't always be here? Is there something that you need to tell us? I won't be here because I'm, I'm going back to Italy. Wow, Ina, back to Italy already? Yeah. (Ina speaking Italian) "You may have the universe if I may have Italy." Yeah, that's something Leo, uh... Signore Russo, my, my tutor, he says that. Mom, that sounds amazing. Honey, after 50 years of, of nonstop work and, you know, giving everything to the farm and to you two, I'm now doing something for myself. Well, I support it. I mean, back to Italy to eat, pray and love Except without the love. (soft music) I'm happy for you, it's just different. Been just you and me here. And me. No, no, of course, I just meant living at the house. It's different. No, it, it is going to be different. But I need to do this for myself and I want your support. Of course, Mom. I'm just worried about you being all alone, that's all. Um, who's doing the pickup in town? (door squeaking) Hey. What a coincidence. Ah, yeah. Um, also, the town's a block long, so. That's right, huh? Can I help you with something? Oh, no, that's okay. Please let me take something. So what's all this. Decorations, paper goods, flowers. It's all for the Maple Christmas Fair tomorrow. We host a big holiday market. It gets a huge turnout. You should come. I wish I could, but I'm on an early flight tomorrow to Aspen. Oh, right, yeah. No, of course. So, uh, tell me more about this festival. Oh, it's an Ina spectacular. It was my mom's addition to the Christmas calendar years ago. We sell maple goods and then the local artists from the town sell their arts, crafts, gifts. It's a tourist favorite. And a big revenue stream for us. Seems like you guys have a lot of revenue streams. Yeah, but it's a matter of necessity. The maple business took years to get financially solvent. And well, we had a few bad years and when my dad left, we had to take out a risky loan. That's why we had to sell the land to the Fernandez family. What about your dad? Oh, you know, Christmas cards, birthday cards. Never on our actual birthdays. It's fine though, we don't hold it against him. It's a hard life out here. It's not for everyone. So the Fernandez land is about much more than just the land. I guess I sort of see it as a symbol or something. Like, like if we get that land back, we'll be okay. We can erase the parts of the past we don't want. But if I'm being totally honest, my sister's not completely on board with buying the land. Oh yeah, business and family, that can be tough. Yeah, I guess so. Didn't used to be though. I mean, how do you and your dad make it work? No, I, I don't think we make it work. He gets what he wants. I back off or give up or give in. And he takes that as me being aimless or having no follow through. (gentle music) Well. Here, let me, uh... It's, it's okay, I got it. I know you do. (gentle music) (door clicks) [Aaron] What's going on here? It's for the Maple Christmas Fair. We make all sorts of maple products. Mm-hmm, maple soap, maple candle. Maple butter, maple candies. Oh, speaking of candies, who's doing the candying? Uh, I don't know what candying is, but if it's a verb form of candy, I'll take the job. Perfect. You wanna keep an eye on the candy thermometer. When it hits 240, you let it cool. Then it needs to be stirred. Here, this one's ready to be stirred. [Aaron] Okay. Now, when you see the shine on top, you transfer the syrup. (syrup bubbling softly) Ah, it's hot! Of course it's hot, it's boiling. I didn't know it was gonna be so hot. There's literally a thermometer sticking out of it. Sad to say, it's in my character. Tell me there's a universe out there that's ever expanding, (sighs) and I'll believe you, but you hang a wet paint sign on a wall, I need to touch it to make sure (soft music) I won't do that again, okay? Don't. (soft music) For your troubles. It was, there's no trouble. Well, then, I guess, for the road. (gentle music) Dad, what are you doing here? I called you and you didn't answer. So I went by the inn, and they said that you might be here. No, what are you doing in Maple Valley? I'm here to look at the land. You said you weren't bidding. (perplexed music) (no audio) Erica, this is my dad, Steve. Steve, this is Erica. Nice to meet you, Erica. So you're the neighbor that's bidding against us for the land? That's me. Well, now I get it. Can you excuse us? I'm sorry. I'll be in touch in a bit, okay? So you're throwing away this deal for a woman you just met that you won't know next week. No, I'm throwing this deal because I have principles. Why are you here? Because I can't trust your decision with this land. So 9:00 AM tomorrow morning, you and me are going on a little walk on the property. What if I'm not there? (Steve sighing) [Steve] You'll be there. (lively music) Aaron's dad's here. Turns out they are still interested in the land. - Heidi. - I'm giving it thought. But I'm still not convinced. Okay, but we only have until tomorrow. Ina, what are we baking for the fair? Well, we're gonna bake some fudge and some babka, yule log and a recipe of shortbread that I found. Girls, still on for the fudge as usual? [Erica and Heidi] Sure. So, Ina, what are you going to do in Italy? Well, everything that I didn't get to do last time. I'm gonna explore all the north, I'm gonna shop in Milan. Yeah, visit Lake Como, get lost in Venice and eat, eat, eat. Ah, sounds perfect. I'm so jealous. Yeah, but won't you get lonely? No, no, I, I'm, I'm not gonna get lonely because I'm not gonna be alone. I have wanted to tell you for some time. You remember my Italian tutor from the language school in Rome. Signore Russo? Just kind of happened. Ina, are you saying you have a secret Italian boyfriend? No, I'm, I mean, yes, he does call himself my boyfriend. Mom, are, are you saying you're going back to Italy for a man you met on vacation? You hardly know him. Erica, I know him and I care for him deeply. And with him, I feel like I'm being given a second chance for love. So be happy for me. We are happy for you. - Really. - Of course we are. It's just, doesn't it seem a little sudden, a little too good to be true? Erica. What? Just because you don't want love doesn't mean Mom can't have it. (gentle music) Yeah, that's true. Sorry, Mom. That's okay. (gentle music continues) You know, we don't really need two people on fudge, so I'll just get started on the shortbread. (gentle music continues) He'll be here. That's him. (gentle music) Mr. Fernandez. Aaron Davenport. My pleasure. Well, let's get started. Please, this way, (lively music) Ladies. (people chattering) - Hey. - Hi. You know, the fair has always been my favorite. I'm really gonna miss it. Erica, we still haven't received an offer from your family. Right. We're working on it. Yes, but between you and me, it seems that the Davenport's are gonna bid and, uh, window closes soon. Well, we're bidding too. We're offering asking price, standard contingencies. Good, send it as soon as you can. Of course. Oh, look at this turnout. I know, it's incredible, right? Heidi, can I steal you for a second? Ooh, your gentleman caller is here. (Chuckling) I'm sorry, I, she got it out of me. - Hello, hi. - Hi. Um, what can I get you? We have maple shortbread. We have maple babka. We have maple fudge. It's a lot of maple. What we wouldn't give to live on cacao farm. Can we speak? I'm sorry. I told my dad we shouldn't bid. I pushed it, but ultimately it's not my decision. It's his, and I guess he's still deciding. Well, thanks for letting me know. And have fun in Aspen. I'm actually gonna stay here until this thing gets figured out. And besides, I gotta, I gotta get my last minute Christmas shopping in. Who you shopping for? I gotta get something for my dad. I'm just not sure this is his jam. Yeah, well, our booth selling money bags, bowties and top hats couldn't make it this year, so. Oh, because he's the Monopoly Man. Sorry. No, sadly, it's, it's kind of true. Maybe I should get him a monocle. What will he get you? Oh, he is gonna get me something generous and expensive, but not necessarily meaningful. You want something meaningful. Yeah, that would be nice. It's been a while. I think the last meaningful gift that I got was when I was five or six years old. It was this fire truck, I wanted it so badly. When I saw it under the tree Christmas morning. It made all these noises, sirens and firemen were talking. I loved it. Then what happened? Then it stopped making noise and, and I stopped playing with it. (soft music) Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, do you know if Erica is planning on sending that email soon. What email? The offer. (soft music) (Heidi sighs) You made an offer behind my back? What? Andres said you were sending him an email with an offer. I'm sorry. I, I was just about to come talk to you about it. I just didn't want us to lose the opportunity. No, this is not about us. This is about you. But you did lose because the Davenport's just bid way over asking price. (gentle music) (Aaron sighs) (no audio) Hey. You still mad at me? Yep. Well, I will say it again. From the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I wanted the land so badly. I made a big mistake. I don't know, Erica. I, I think the fact is, is that even though we're supposed to be partners now, you still just see me as your little sister. Well, I can be better. Okay? Okay. How are you feeling about the Davenport's buying the Fernandez land? Not great. Yeah. I mean, I know it's not Aaron's fault, but I still just wanna scream at him. Well, uh, here is your opportunity because he just pulled up. What? Yeah. Or, other option, I could go to the barn and get the sleigh ready for tomorrow. You're going out the back. Just tell him I'm not here. You don't wanna be mature and try to talk to him or... No. No? No. Hey, Erica is not here. Is she in the barn? Yeah. Yeah, she's in the barn. Thanks, Heidi. Yeah. How's hiding from me going? I'm not hiding. I'm working. Oh, yeah. What are you still doing in town? I'm purposely obfuscating the contract. Don't tell my dad. So you're moonlighting as Santa? Is this another Holden revenue stream? It's for our horse drawn sleigh ride which starts tomorrow. We take guests out to a cabin in the woods, serve them a prime rib dinner. Well, can I, can I help? Thanks, but I... I'm just about finished. Erica, I'm sorry. I tried, I just, my dad doesn't listen to me. Then why do you work for him? I'm sorry, it's just, it's your life. What are you doing with it? I don't know. But you don't think I ask myself that every day? You don't think that I, I know that I'm wasting my life trying to make my dad happy because I don't know what would make me happy. Why don't you quit? Because this has always been the plan. Ever since I was 10 years old, to take over the business. I can't, I can't just quit on him. I also don't know what else I would do. Do you wanna go for a ride? Can I wear the hat? I can't even get a pity hat. (bright music) Wow. (playful music) You're tough. What? I can almost remember being here with my mom. Not an actual memory, but just a, a feeling of how much she would've loved it here. Wanted to move to horse country. My dad didn't want to, so she would just take me riding every chance you got. 'Til she got sick. How old were you? I was 10 when she passed. Too young. It's always too young to have your heart broken. (soft music) (soft music continues) (boots thudding) (boots thudding) I'm still curious just to know why you're not dating anyone. Oh, I wouldn't say it's why, but I was married. I got divorced four years ago. It's fine. He was one of those adrenaline seeking four season sports kind of guys, led trekking trips across the country. Came out here looking for the Wild West. Did he find it? I don't know what he found. Whatever it was, it wasn't enough. Little house, little farm, little life. He got bored of it. Got bored of me. That's not possible. What about you? Divorces, breakups? Opportunity to trauma bond. Nah, I don't know. No real, I mean, couple long relationships, but nothing too serious. Why not? I don't know. Maybe my dad was right, maybe I have no follow through. (gentle music) Maybe you'll have follow through when you find something you wanna follow through on. (gentle music) It's getting dark. I have to get back. My family does this pioneer Christmas thing tonight. What's that? Like blacksmithing and cholera, but make it Christmas. Exactly. (Chuckles) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (fire crackling) Sausages, campfire spuds. Okay, you gotta eat up, Aaron. Put some meat on those bones. If there's not enough, - I don't have t... - Oh, no, there's more than enough. And we're happy to have you here. You know, Mom started pioneer Christmas when we were kids, to honor our great-grandparents who didn't have a working stove their first Christmas. So they cooked holiday dinner over an open fire. But really, we think Mom just wanted a night off of the dishes. So before I leave, I want you to meet Leo so I suggested he come here for Christmas. This Christmas? Yeah. But it's always just us. It's, it's tradition. It's practically a rule. It's just family. But things change. I want you to meet him. I mean, I'd wanna meet the man that you were uprooting your life for. Mom, your trip to Italy's, not just a visit, is it? (gentle music) (Ina sighs) (gentle music continues) (no audio) (door squeaking) (door slams) Have you seen Mom? I think she's on her way back from the airport. Wow. So this is really happening then. And it's happening sooner than we thought. (bright music) (bright music continues) [Ina] Here's Leo. Mwah, mwah. I am so happy to be here. And in time for the sleigh ride. I was afraid I'd missed it. No, no, no, you have plenty of time to settle in - before the sleigh ride? - Oh, good. Mom, when you said that Leo would be coming for Christmas, I didn't know you meant today. Well, Christmas is three days away. If he's gonna come, now's the time. Yeah, I, I guess so. Erica, I know this is difficult for you and I know why. But please, pull it together. (gentle music) (Steve sighs) Should we keep waiting for him? No. Follow me. (bright music) Hey there. You here for the sleigh ride? Do you have room? Not in the back, but in front if you wanna work? Yeah, I do have to earn that hat. (laughing) You can wear this one. (bright music) All right. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the 55th annual Maple Valley Christmas sleigh ride. Now technically we've been doing this ride for 55 years. My family has been doing it for over a century, ever since my great-grandparents came here and come winter discovered there were no roads. Probably why it was affordable. Now please keep your arms and legs inside. And I hope you're hungry, because we are off. (bright music) (bright music continues) Will you give me a turn? Oh, you think you can handle this? Oh yeah, I can handle it. (bright music continues) Keep the rein's taut, no slack. Don't try to force it, just feel it. It's not about them listening to you, it's about you listening to each other, connecting. (bright music) (bright music continues) You're doing great. Of course I'm doing great. I'm a natural.

I am kinda like an annoyingly positive magic eight ball. It's not annoying. I love it. But yes, I was, uh, I was gonna say all those things. Well, they'd all be true. I mean, it is special, right? You know, my grandfather used to love hosting this event. It's amazing seeing what it's grown into today. We had to move it out here to the barrel room years ago, just to make space. It's a great place to host a dinner. That was my grandfather's idea. You know, he used to insist on cooking the entire meal himself. Or else rope me into helping him, but I enjoyed every minute of it of course. You really do love what you do. I do. You should too. I mean, I, I love aspects of it. (sighs) I love building something from the ground up. I love the problem solving, the creativity. I just don't love the projects my dad picks or working with him on them. But I really do like the work. You ever thought about going out on your own? (gentle music) ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ - ♪ All is bright ♪ - Wanna dance?

Where were you today? You just don't show up. You're selfish. I'm selfish? Yeah, you're selfish. Yeah? Remember that Christmas you got me that fire truck? Vaguely. It made all these cool noises, I loved it. I played with it for six months. Then all of a sudden it just stopped making noise. I asked you what happened to it and you said it was broken. Okay. You know Mom. I mean, she kept, she kept all my old toys in that chest. Well, I came across that firetruck, had a note attached to it that said, "Debbie, don't replace the batteries. Tell Aaron it's broken. It's annoying." Okay, I made some mistakes, but I'm just trying to teach you- I didn't need to be taught. (sad music) I needed to be loved. (sad music continues) I'm gonna get back to work. I think you've taught me well. (sad music continues) (sad music continues) Ah, buongiorno. Good morning. Thanks. Where's my mom? I think she's still sleeping in. Oh, okay. You're up early. Not really. It's 16 o'clock in Italy and two days before Christmas. We have a lot to do, make a menu and shop and cook. It's all about food for me always, but especially the holidays. Maybe we should talk about the Christmas Eve dinner menu. We have a tradition in Italy, The Feast of the Seven Fishes. La Vigilia, all fish dishes. Wow, that sounds, it's a lot of fish. Um, it's just, normally for Christmas Eve, we do maple everything. Maple glazed ham, maple Brussels sprouts. I could do a maple salmon, hm? The feast of one fish. Yeah. Um, you know, we could, we could discuss that more. But, you know, I've gotta, just gotta get to town and, and do some last minute Christmas shopping. Yes, of course. Right, okay. Ciao. (door squeaking) (bright music) Erica. Hey. Still Christmas shopping? Yeah, just picking up my dad's present. How about you? You got your hands full there. Uh, yeah, last minute errands. Do you have a minute to talk? I have something I want to discuss with you. Yeah. So you remember how you told me last night how I should start my own firm? Sure. Well, I've been thinking about it, how I have my access to financing, my network, and then it hit me. My dad, he, he hasn't signed the contract for the land yet. He hasn't put the deposit down. He's done the walkthrough and, and is waiting on the surveyor. So technically, other offers can still be accepted. Aaron, I can't outbid your dad. But what if you could? (gentle music) What are you guys doing? Your mom, she made a sock for me. A stocking, honey, stocking. We thought while they were hanging the stockings that we could stuff them. Heidi, could I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Listen, I just saw Aaron, and I know it sounds a little weird, but he wants to help us buy the land, as like a silent partner or a guarantor or something. See, then the land would cost less and we'd have more capital left over for your business plan. Erica, I said no to the land. And then you went and got Aaron involved. No, no, it was entirely Aaron's idea. Yeah, maybe, okay, but it still feels disrespectful to me. How? It has nothing to do with respect. You know, this is the same issue that we've had our entire lives, where you're the big sister and you know best, and you get to decide everything, where you and Mom are a team and I'm just... What? I didn't know you felt that way. Yeah, well, I do. And I also feel like you don't listen to me. We're supposed to partners. I'm beginning to wonder if we're even capable of that. (sad music) (soft music) (soft music continues) How'd the survey go? Good, yeah, it's a go. Just waiting on the report. And once I get it, I'll send the deposit over. Dad, I'm, I'm asking you one last time not to move forward with this. And I'm telling you, no. Then I quit. Oh, come on Aaron, you're not gonna quit. This company's gonna be yours one day. I don't want it. Of course you do, because that's been the point of this whole thing. All my hard work to make sure that even when I'm not there, you'll be taken care of. No, it's not. You didn't do this for me. You did this for you. (sad music) You know, I don't know how to fix things between you and I, but I know it starts with me not working for you anymore. (sad music continues) (no audio) I thought I'd find you here. I got some news. In today's episode of Davenport Drama, I told my dad I quit. Wow. And we probably only have until tomorrow morning to make an offer. Yeah, right, um, about that. Thank you for trying and all the effort you put in, but we're not gonna do it. Why not? Heidi doesn't want to. And she's right. It's an emotional decision. Yeah, but sometimes those decisions lead to the best decisions. And sometimes they're the decisions that we regret. The ones we wish we could run away from or undo, the ones that leave you bored. I'm not your ex. I know that. But you're still... Go on, I'm still, I'm still what? You're a rich kid who's lost and thinks he'll find himself by putting on a Stetson and playing cowboy. (horse neighing) Look, I support you finding yourself. But whatever it is you're looking for, you're not gonna find it here. Maybe you don't pick the wrong guys. Maybe you pick the right guys and just drive them away. Maybe I do. But like I said, I don't date tourists. You know, I was trying to figure out what I had to do to earn that hat. But I realized you were never gonna gimme that hat. (forlorn music) (forlorn music continues) (forlorn music continues) (bright music) (bright music continues) Oh, come decorate. But we already decorated. Leo brought his family ornaments from Italy, so we're adding them. But we always do the tree a certain way. It's just a tree. It's not just a tree. It's a way things are. It's a way things have always been, a way they're supposed to continue being. Okay, honey, but things change and, and we're gonna move through this together. We're not gonna move through it together because you're leaving. And it seems like you wanna leave too since all we do lately is argue. I'm trying here. But maybe you just don't know how to be a partner. Heidi. I'm sorry. But, well, you always wanna prove how you don't need anyone, you can do everything on your own. Maybe you should. What's that supposed to mean? It means that I don't wanna lose you as a sister, so maybe I need to lose you as a partner. 'Cause it seems like you would rather run the farm on your own, so do it. Buy me out. (forlorn music) (forlorn music ending) - Hi. - Hey. Just checking out. Oh, sure. Oh, yeah, actually, your father left this for you. Thanks. (soft music) (soft music continues) (paper rustling) (soft music continues) (soft music continues) "I replaced the batteries. Dad." (soft music continues) (knife rasping) (gentle music) All your maple recipes, just how you like them. Maybe next year we could do the Feast of the Seven Fishes in Tuscany. Yes. Erica, can you come here a sec. Andres? The Davenport's withdrew their offer. The property's all yours. Oh, um, well, you see, about that, um- Thank you so much, Andres. Erica is excited to move forward. - What? - Just um, let her know next steps. I'll email the documents over after Christmas - Okay. - And Merry Christmas. [Heidi] You too. (soft music) Heidi, I'm not gonna buy the land. You were right. I can't do everything alone. You have Margot and Ollie and you can hire more staff. I don't want more staff, I want a partner. I want a best friend, I want my sister. (soft music) I don't wanna do this without you. And not just because I need you, but because there is no joy in it without you. I know I've let you down, but I am begging you to give me another chance. I, I will be better. It's not just you Erica, it's half me. I've been so defensive and I get jealous of you and Mom sometimes because it just seems like you both belong here more than I do, like you're both made for this and maybe I'm not. That is not true. I know it'll be a lot of hard work, but I don't wanna give up on us. I want us to be partners. Good. Me too. (gentle music) That's good, because I can't afford to buy you out. (laughs) Then I guess we're doing this. I don't wanna buy the land if you think it's an emotional decision. I think it's an emotional decision, but that doesn't mean I don't think it's the right one. (no audio) (gentle music) You okay honey? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. And I will be okay without you. Oh, I know you will. I'm sorry I wasn't happier for you about Leo. I am happy. I guess I just felt like you were abandoning me and I think I always saw you as a strong single woman who was happy to be alone and that made it okay for me to be that way too. It is okay. And you're not alone. Um, speaking of... What happened with Aaron? I messed up. Maybe it would've worked or maybe it never would've worked and he'd have gotten bored or left or broken my heart. Well, none of that happened. And you still have a broken heart. I know it's scary. I know. I'm terrified. (gentle music) [Aaron] Hi, you've reached Aaron, leave a message. (phone beeps) Hi. It's me. Listen, I know you probably don't wanna hear from me. I just wanna say you're not a tourist. And I, I should have said this earlier, but I feel the same way you do. I feel found, and I know that you might be an emotional decision, but um, I also know that you would be the best decision. So I guess what I'm, I'm trying to say is, do you wanna come for dinner? And I realize that was a really long way of saying that, so yeah, um, that's it. Bye. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) Yeah. Who's hungry? Sorry, can we just wait one more minute? (doorbell rings) (gentle music) Hi. Hi. Well, no one's ever been quite so disappointed to see me. No, I'm, I'm sorry. I just... Come in, please. Everyone, this is Steve. - Hey. - Welcome, Steve. - Hi. - Steve. I invited him. I told him Aaron might be here. He's not? No, please stay anyway. Thank you for withdrawing your offer. Well, it meant a lot to Aaron. Come on in, Steve. This is my younger daughter, Heidi. Hi, nice to meet you. Trevor. Ciao, I'm Leo. - Okay. - Be happy to, yeah. Let's eat. You wanna say thanks? - Yes. - Okay. Thank you for this food, for this family, this land, this work and this life. Thank you for all the things that have come before us and all the things yet to come. And thank you for the things we can't change and all the things we can. Yeah. Merry Christmas. [All] Merry Christmas. (doorbell rings) (gentle music) (gentle music continues) You called. (gentle music continues) You're late. Maybe I got lost or maybe I'm right on time. And you just weren't ready for me before. (gentle music) Erica, Aaron, dinner. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) Come here.
