Four to eight degrees above zero, in Östergötland up to ten degrees. About half clear and break. Why is it taking so long? Can't we listen to music? I try to listen. A southwesterly wind brings mild air across the country. Staying weather is expected and several plus degrees. Svealand and Norrland... It wouldn't snow, would it? Now you're asking the right questions. Something up there is interfering SMHI's forecasts again. I was right. Here he comes! - Did it go well? - Yes, everything is included. Satellite measurements and forecasts from the 1960s onwards. I knew I could count on you, Lennart. What does it say? Hi, Denise! Shouldn't you be be home in bed right now? It's all right. She's on top of things. Are you ready soon? I think Kicki saw me. I need to bring these to the union hall for analysis. No. What can I say when there are missing measurements in the archive? The truth. That this is bigger than us. - The association will never agree to that, Uno. - Then maybe we don't need them. This was a mistake. Give me those. Uno, give me those! - Fan, Kicki...! - Put your belt on! Give me those! Amazing gay basement. Where are your bolt cutters? Bride, what's your name? I'll give you a beer if you get us in! Are you scared? Shit, look! Starfall! - Then you have to make a wish. - What are you, five? It's not a star. It's a rock burning up in the Earth's atmosphere. - Shit. How can you do that? - My dad was the head of the worst UFO cult ever. - What, so you believe in aliens and stuff? - Shut up. Dad was stupid, but he he's dead now, so it doesn't matter. - What the hell is wrong with her? - It's her, I swear. Is she the UFO chick? What's going on? Wait, wait, wait! Hi, Tomi. Hi, Denise. Where's the shrimp salad? - I gave it to you to do something fun. - I was having fun. What would they say at home if they found out what you were doing? - Like you're going to run. - I'm really horny this time. - Want to be sent out again? - I don't need anybody, I can take care of myself. How's it going? Shall we go to the station? so you know what you're doing? You know what soc said when I found you down in the basement? 'No mum and a tinfoil hat for dad. The girl's fucked.' You know what I said? - Chewing. - Exactly. So don't let those idiots be right. - Maybe I'm a freak, like Dad. - You're not a freak. Just fucking slow. Stop! What's going on? The traffic lights are broken! He just drove straight the fuck out! 7-15. Serious accident at the junction Nelins - Trozelli. Trouble with traffic lights. Low pressure over Denmark is moving east, into southern Sweden. An extensive rainfall area has moved across the country - - with heavy rain in several places. In Östergötland we warn of large with up to 50 mm of rain. Wind around south with fresh or strong gusts. Cloudy and rainy... Stay in the car. What the hell? I don't mean that. If I had come home in a police car I wouldn't have been able to go out for a week. - The police said Denise didn't do anything. - Do you believe that? Good morning! It is unclear what caused the overnight power outage. This morning, several areas in Norrköping without power. Where were you last night? What Kenneth is trying to say is you can talk to us, Denise. What the hell are you doing? Exactly the same model and exactly the same colour. What if it's Dad's car? Uno got lost and disappeared on the mountain. You know that. - We found his car and everything. - I know. But what if you were wrong? See what the farmer says. A driverless car crashed through the roof from a big red glow in the sky. - Does it say how much he's had to drink? - We don't know what happened to Dad. What? What are you talking about? What if he found something in the mountains... who took him. You're right. Let's call UFO Sweden. - For real? - No! What are you doing?! You're a dot away from going to juvenile hall. - Are you going to hang out with those fools again? - You don't believe me... I know what faith does to people. I have seen it. So have you. - Dad would have believed me. - That's the problem. I think that's what's good, to show people who are out of touch. - How the hell did this happen? - It must be 45-50 away to the road. If it didn't fly in through the ceiling as the farmer said, then. Shit, he's watched a few episodes X-Files too much, that one. Yes, damn... Shit, there's someone in the car. - Where the hell is she?! - Up there! Stop! What happened to your friend? Want to know a secret? You and I can take care of ourselves. We don't need no damn cowards. Give me the wind for Norrköping and Jukkasjärvi. 11 April and 1 December -75. Here. Wind speed in Norrköping 7 mps, 2 in Jukkasjärvi. Good, good. RF for all Swedish cities with more than 15 mm precipitation, 1965-1975. - RF. You mean humidity? - That's my little Sputnik, that. Lund 96% in January, Mjölby had 95 in May. It comes from the mountains. - I'll get the jacket. - No! No! No! It will be freezing, and yards of snow. - But I'm on top of things. - You know what? That's why I need you here, by the radio. - So you can help me get back home. - But I hate being alone. I don't think we're alone. Here... See you soon, Sputnik! Over and out. Huge, yes. And in what direction did you say that you saw the object? Söder? Mhm... And then it shone brightly, like? Mm... It cannot have been so that it was the moon you saw, then? I'm just mentioning it, because there was a full moon yesterday, see. Then we have probably sorted out that phenomenon too, ser'ru. Yes. Thanks for calling. The full moon, again. The old classic. - Mats, will you include it in the compilation? It's already done. In addition to the moon, we have power outages, satellites, billy goons. - dirt on camera lenses, northern lights - - plastic bag flapping in the wind, and one with a psychological explanation. No UFOs this month either. I have a thing. It concerns your chairman. - Lennart! - Yes? I downloaded this report... Denise... What? Uno's kid? Sputnik! And what do you want? On Friday, SMHI went out and warned for heavy rain. There were zero millimetres. 21.55 the power went on all over Norrköping. Nobody understands why. 15 minutes later a red Saab 90 crashes - - through the roof of Ulf Göransson's barn. According to him, the from a great red glow in the sky. He calls the cops, who just laugh. So I go there myself. Unfortunately, the number plates were missing, but on the radio... sat dad's cassette tape. This is Dad's car. - Little friend. You can't just come and... - Gunnar. What if what the farmer saw... it was like dad has been looking for all this time. What took him. Can I see that tape? - It's still in the car. - And the car is...? At the police station. - So you have no evidence for what you say. - What evidence? - You believe in this stuff. - We're an objective reviewing association... working with facts and evidence. - So you're saying the farmer is lying? - No. I say that faith is one thing, but to know is something else entirely. Mats? 'The observed phenomenon is a result of charged particles' - - 'as in a geomagnetic storm thrown from the surface of the sun' - - 'collided with oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere and caused the aurora borealis.' Also called the Northern Lights. The farmer was not the only one who saw a red phenomenon that night. I think we got into sixteen similar observations. - So the phenomenon is already investigated. - What about the blackout? Yeah, what... If you... If you take a magnet and run it through a coil of wires, you get... A generator. I know. Good. What do you think happens then - - if you take a fistful of magnetic particles from the sun - - and throws them through the earth's power grid? Though a northern lights may not Dad's car to end up in a barn. No, but a drunk driver who sees a northern light can easily miss a curve. You see what you want to see, exactly like your father. Can I have some coffee? Exactly, Lennart. Now we don't work anymore on assumptions and speculations. No, no. Those days are over. But good to see you. - Have a bun when you leave. - Sure. Dad figured out there's something out there - exactly where and when it would end up here. Uno's old equation? Where did you get this? It doesn't matter. His theories about disturbed weather forecasts were wrong anyway. You think so, yeah. Then why don't you explain what that nonsense means, then. - This means that we are not alone. - And yet that's how he died. Alone. Lennart! Though in the case of newly arrived testimony additional investigation can be carried out... after voting. It says so in the statutes. The statutes say that we shall counteract uncritical thinking. - Also unwarranted scepticism. - It's just a northern light. But without a field survey, how can you know for sure? I don't know. But it could be because I have a master's degree in astrophysics, Mats. But do you have any proof? Who votes for further investigation of the phenomenon? Absolutely, if that's what the association wants we'll conduct a survey. But according to the statutes we should start with the most probable. And that is that there has been a solar storm. Then there are elevated values of electro- magnetism remain that can be measured. Evidence. Pack UHF antennas, signal amplifiers, EMS meters. - Where do we have all that stuff? - Check the stash. - Don't forget the splice cord this time. - Got it! - Departure T-2 minutes! We're going to SMHI's old measuring site behind Krokek. Southeasterly winds. We have to look up EMS meters on the other side of the grove. - Karl did it, didn't he? - Yes, Karl-Tefat. Thanks for helping me before. I'm the one to thank. For the aurality I borrowed when you were seven. I think more clearly when it blocks all the astral energies they radiate towards us. - Here. - It's all right. - You can keep it. - Nice! Yes. Let them have their little adventure. Everything is soon back to normal when they discover that she is just as crazy as her father. - How's it going? - Don't just stand there, saucer. He's fallen! - What is this? - I don't know. There shouldn't be anything here. - I guess it's a regular weather station. - This is not a weather station. - What is it, then? - Shit. That's a CTE 8-agg. We're talking top of the line! It is used to power Intel's latest superprocessors. G+ series. Whatever they're measuring here requires a lot of processing power. If we break in, I can hack the network and get all the readings. So, the answers to everything that has happened. - Did you hear that, Lennart? - What? Yes, yes. Stupid. Come on, so we don't get involved in anything. Don't you think I know what you're doing, do you? Your dad screwed us all, because of his ideas. Poor Lennart was kicked out of SMHI. And not only that. Then he was hanged as criminal tinfoil hat in the world of science! If you even think about of doing something like that... Then I'll make sure that a lost father will be the least of your worries. Fucking crutch mongo. Yeah, I'm... Ready for measurement. - What have you done wrong? - What? It doesn't work. You must have wired something wrong. Sure! I've got auralite in my pocket. It may block electromagnetic radiation with. - Is it working now? - No. Is it working now? - I'll go get him. - Yes, it's your turn. - Saucer! Tefat! - What? But what the hell...? - Lennart... - I'll get her. We have visitors. Maybe it's time to fold up the hooves now. That could be a useful lesson for her. Let's pack up the stuff. It's time to go. - Where's Denise? - Yeah, you. She left. Typical star. What is she doing here? I guess it's just a regular service job, you'll see. Sends SMHI its head of research on a service job at nine o'clock on a Saturday? I hope you get OB for this. - Backa. This is a protected area. - I saw it, it was on the sign. Why is that, Kicki? Lennart? - Are you looking for saucers? - Cut the crap. Don't you think I see that's a... CTE... 8-agg? For an astungt G+series. Here's someone who's taken a computer license. That's great. Congratulations. I might as well confess, then. Since you were fired, SMHI has been covered... cover for the state's secret UFO institute. This facility, why isn't it on the map? What do you think? Because you and your UFO gang will stay away. Or maybe you don't want your your bosses to know what you're doing here. - What? - Damn, you kept looking, didn't you? You understood that me and Uno were on to something. And then you hung me out to dry, to steal our discovery! No aliens interfere with weather forecasts. This is all about... Absolutely right decision, Lennart. Hop in! They have our measurement data! Open the gate now. Open the door! Lennart... - Lennart...! - Denise! Add a coal! - The package is in! - Go! She lied to my face! Kicki is still looking for what is interfering with the forecasts. Can you see what's in that? You bet your ass, old man! Do you have a 12-volt voltage converter, do you? What do you think happens when the police get wind of this? - See what's in that? - Wait, wait, wait! I haven't even started yet! A whole lot of abbreviations. EM, CA, RF, BU, N, NT... - N? Did you say N? N as in Niklas? - Yes, that's a lot of N. - What does it mean? - Newton. - And what does that mean? - That Uno was right. Newton is the measure of gravity. Uno had a theory. Every time SMHI's forecasts were wrong - - it was due to that the Earth's gravitational field - - was influenced by something - or someone. A UFO? All we needed was more data, but SMHI dismissed it all as the invention of a madman. - SMHI is not looking for alien devices. - No, but Kicki does. Which means that Uno was on to something. How do we find this UFO? We can try with following the flashing lights. - Gasa! Go! - Ten o'clock! Gasa! What the hell? We can't stay here. We have to get out of here. But then, there is a UFO in the woods and we're getting out of there! You don't steal government property. We have to return the device, so we don't get involved in anything. SMHI will lock in everything in their fucking archives. Better that than us. I only want what's best for the association. Who's in on it? We'll take it at the board meeting. this afternoon. - Yes, but... - So we get it on the record. According to the statutes. The meeting starts at one o'clock. Can you find anything in that device before Gunnar forces us to return it? Can you crack Dad's equation? Don't be late for the meeting. It starts at one o'clock. What has happened? The blackout must have overloaded the electronics and triggered a chain reaction. - What devastation. For a power outage? - Really... - More questions? - No, that's fine. Thank you. Thank you. This is a protected area. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - You don't think there's anything missing here? - Do I look like a technician? I take it with my colleagues and get back to you. I can talk to them now. Hey, a tip from a who has already made a career. Don't try so hard. A tip from a police officer. Don't lie. - They were here, weren't they? - Who were? UFO Sweden. It was my first case here in Norrköping. A little girl lost her father at the same time. It's about time someone put an end for this UFO cult. Give me your testimony and I can for theft and trespassing. One week. That's all I need. So you will never again have problems with the old men. Get my data back... you have my testimony. You... They are not just old men. They had help. By a young girl. Turn off the internet! I'm gonna call my mom! - What has happened? - I'll take it up with her first. Denise, the police here want to talk to you. Do you have time? Lennart... Are we waiting for something, or what? Everyone's here. Let's get started, shall we? The meeting starts at one o'clock, so... There's a minute left. So everyone has time to get coffee... There are buns too that Gunnar has bought. Who is it? Don't you recognize him? He's the president of your father's association. If they have contacted you, or in any way asked for your help. - you have to tell me now. Why? You never listen to me anyway. Are you ready or what? - What's in your back? - Nothing. - Give hit. - Ow! Can't a man have a private life? Okay, look. Check it out! Next time, you can arrest me right away. - Sorry. I just thought... - That I'm a freak, like Dad? Sorry. That's where the bell struck one. It's time to start the meeting, isn't it? Shall we take the vote and we can release it later? Should the meeting be valid we must follow the agenda. And I see that point ended up last. Then I welcome you to today's board meeting. Welcome. And hereby declare... the meeting opened. - Election of the President? - Sitting. Any other suggestions? Lennart Svahn. Sorry I'm late! On the log there was a lot of data and I was like, shit, this is crazy. And then ba' - boom! Ta-da! Proof! And what are we glutting on, then? The weatherman has been searching for gravitational anomalies since November 25, 1988. The same day my father disappeared. It proves that they understood that Dad was on to something. - and that the UFO we saw crash has to do with my father's disappearance. What your father was on the track, we don't know. Why SMHI started chasing gravity, we don't know that either. Just a lot of questions leading to new questions. But that's how you find the answers! Wasn't that why you started this association? To explain the inexplicable. And to find the answers. How will you ever find any answers if you never dare to ask the question? I think you're right, Gunnar. We'll take the vote right now. How many want to keep the hard drive and find answers? Hands up. Yes, one more thing too. - The cops are on their way. - What? Then I propose that we close the meeting and continue at my home. The vote is not approved if we do not follow the agenda. Election of secretary - Karl. Anyone against? Election of the recorder - Töna. Anyone against? Adoption of the agenda. Any objections? Financial report? Well... Yes, we have coffee... Excellent. Then we hereby resolve that to conduct Denise's field investigation, 4-1. Other questions? - Denise? - Do you have a back door? That's good, Töna. Thank you, thank you. This will be a good liaison centre while the police calm down. We can clean it up a bit. Do you live here? Yes, it's a bit funny. This is my grandfather's old junk. After the incident at SMHI, I moved here to get some peace and quiet. That's eight years now, but it is what it is. It's amazing! Here. You take that one. I don't understand how Uno ...could make any sense out of that. I have a feeling that we will do well anyway. What if it's connected to the ghost rockets of 1946? Go. I'm getting goose bumps, Tefat. Who's ready for some UFO hunting? Born ready! Put on double coffee pots. This will be our biggest field investigation ever. - Cool! - Here we go. Yes, you know the drill. The first step in any field survey... - is that each one fill in their own report form. We don't want to risk contamination by each other's testimonies - - so don't peek at each other. Next step: return to observation to confirm the data. Hopefully they correlate with reality. At the same time, we collect additional facts - - to exclude as many potential explanations as possible. Confirmed: there are no military exercises in the area. Then it's time to collect more testimonies. I know this is difficult. - but also a no can exclude large search areas. My name is Töna, from UFO Sweden. Thought I'd ask if we could ask some questions for you. Did you notice anything different last night? No idea. - Were you home last night at 8:30? - No. - 20.32? - 20.32 time? 20.32? No, I was at home with the bitch. - And where do you live? - Over there. - There? Didn't you see anything? - No, I didn't see anything. Saucers, the reports of the ghost rockets, have you seen them? Based on the testimony, the UFO came from the west. That means the UFO has crashed... here. - Are you coming? - No, no, no, no. I'll be fine. I feel all of the leg a little bit, so you guys go. If you want to get off this, that's fine. I hadn't thought of stopping yet, if that's what you're wondering. I thought I'd just get some well-deserved rest. The club will be fine. Lennart, don't you see what's happening here? Gunnar, look at them. Look at Karl. When was the last time you saw him like this? Hey, I know what a Star goes for. When she's done with you, it's me who'll have to clean up the mess. Hey, you. It's Gunnar. Hi, Gunnar. Look, I would need some help with a red Saab 90. The idea is based on the same principle as wormholes. That gravity bends spacetime and thus travel enormous distances. Hey, Tefat, it sounds like science fiction. I'm just saying that warp drive is a possible means of transportation. East side probed. Negative result. - I don't get it. It should be here. - Let's see if we made a mistake. I haven't done anything wrong! It would not be the first time a UFO gets away. Warp drive. I'm just mentioning it. Name it, it says. Learn to speak Swedish. What the fuck is this? Have you not considered that the SMHI certainly has a lot of secret measuring stations. If I just hack their network, I could triangulate the exact location of the impact. We don't do that anymore. Don't you care what happened to Dad? - I don't want to risk the association. - Who cares about your fucking association? What would they do there without the association? - Losing it would be like losing your... - Family? Should I go talk to her, or? - Nä... She'll be back. - Yes. Kristina? We want to exchange a few words with you. Do you know what this is? An invoice for removal and decontamination of a measuring station in Krokek. - No. - Strange. It has your signature. Well... Now I know. It was a small pilot project that we did. Three CTE 8 units. Why have these sums not accounted for? I understand how this sounds, but... I can assure you that everything is as it should be. There's a policeman looking for you. Excuse me. - Tell me you have it. - No. The association has gone underground. - Then we're done with each other. - But I know how to find them. Here's how... Did they put the hard drive into a connected computer - - their IP number is pinged on your network. Digital fingerprints. If I can get my hands on that, I can track them. You can reach the network via my computer. Make sure you find those tinfoil hats and come back with my data. Is it fixable? I'm just so tired of that nobody listens to me. I don't feel normal. Would it be abnormal to think that even father had been abducted by aliens? Uh! Who says something so stupid? But you... We're on to something big. The last time it happened, it was a solo player who sabotaged everything. My suggestion is that we try solve this, but... we do it together. It was not okay, what Dad did to you. He should not have left you like that. It wasn't just me he left. - Can you help me with something first? - I have to get home. Kenneth's gonna go nuts. It goes fast. Lennart... Lennart, wait! - What are you doing? - Someone's here! - What are you doing? - Celebrating. - What? - Your membership... It would be unprofessional not to recruit a field investigator as good as you. It's a needle, not a ring. Of course it is. You're fucking sick in the head! A four cheers for Denise! Long live her. Hip, hip... Hooray, hooray, hooray! - I've got some smoke in my eye here... - May I? - A small improvement anyway. - Fuck you! See, yes. Congratulations. Say, did my calasin offer got lost in the mail, or? No, that's all right. Because I have a present too. When you were away I did a little research of my own. Unlike you I had some success. Can you imagine? There at the police station... where I found it. So I bought it off for a little money. Thought it would make a nice gift. It can't... I found Dad's car in the barn. Here... Here's the ownership certificate. The police are completely safe. - They are wrong. - How did you come to that conclusion, then? - Dad's music. - Uh, music... A cassette tape, you can buy that at any gas station. You're lying. You just want to screw up. You haven't come up with anything. And now you know why. Don't listen to him. He doesn't know what's true. The truth is, this is the car Uno left behind on the mountain. I'm sorry, but Dad won't be coming back anymore. Well. Where have you been? Well, I'm exhausted. Have you heard of digital fingerprints? - Yeah, I'm... - Come. - What...? - Come here, sit down. You'll have to correct me if I'm wrong. If you plug in a hard disk into a connected computer - - shouldn't the IP address be pinged on the host's network then? Jo... Now the freaks are fucking smoked. How do you get this address, then? - What? You don't have it? - I don't get any of this. That's why I'm here. I need professional help. - How did you join the SMHI network? - Just some contacts... But this is really super secret. I can trust you, right? Absolutely. Is it possible to click a little slower? I'm just making sure that the IP numbers in DOS match subscriber and carrier. Sure! - And? - Nada. Must have been a super professional to help them. - I gotta go. - Of course. But, hey, thanks for the help. Good night. Denise! Denise! What the hell did you do? What? Open the door! Do you understand what I'm saying? Open the door! Denise! Now you open! Now you're in deep shit! Denise! What's going on? Gunnar is wrong! I know it was Dad's car in the barn. And I know where the UFO crashed. In Little Elk Lake! The UFO was in the water the whole time. Is the UFO in the water? How do you know this? A witness called in. I told you. But it doesn't matter. - Just gather everyone at the junkyard! - I'll call them. Balle, you're so scary! A new witness called in, so you can keep your car. I didn't hear any rings. Must be the age. Hearing is the first to go. Maybe I'm old, but I'm not stupid. This is the way it's going to be, little girl. You leave the association voluntarily. Otherwise I'll tell you what you're doing. Hey, stop! You're gonna get your ass kicked for this. - Polis! Stop! - It's her you're after! Drop the stick. Drop the stick! - Where's Gunnar? - In the room. The coffee maker broke. We've never done one of these survey without Gunnar. Have you ever found anything? Should we do it together, or what? We are big enough to do it without Gunnar. Hell, we've got a UFO to salvage! - I guess you just have to hook the container. - Saucer, will you start the crane? Do you have a plan? Fishing trip. Oh! Fuck...! A little more... Sink, fool! Move in as far as you can. Let's take this UFO. Here, take it. Will roots here, Mats. Uno would have been proud of you. It's so strange. I have all my life searching for answers. And now I'm almost a little afraid of the answer. There's a life jacket in the back if you want to jump off. Gunnar is wrong, you know that, right? You're nothing like your father. Not the bad parts, anyway. When we get that UFO up the whole world will want to talk to us. We will not have a moment's peace. Go ahead and enjoy yourself. This is the calm before the storm. - Lennart... - Yes? There's something I have to tell you. We've got a hit! Yes! I want to believe! Fool! We have to go in! Thank you very much. Karl, get up to the container and then... Karl! Connect the magnet to the winch. - Töna, pull my signal. Lowest gear. Mats, pour the last of the diesel into the aggregates. - It's serious now. Do you understand? Sir, yes, sir! Denise to Fool. Start the winch! Soppatorsk on three! Töna, put it in second gear! - No, keep pulling! - Denise, I don't think... We risk bottoming out if we stay! - Pull! Lennart? Lennart! Fool, start the engine! I'll get the grip! But take, then! Cancel! Cancel! Watch out! Karl! Mats! Did it go well? What the hell are you doing? We could have died! - I don't get it. It was... - It was an airplane. - That's not true. The UFO must... - IFO. - The object is identified. Hence IFO. - Shut up! We need to get it back up! Otherwise we don't know. - Lennart! - What was that? - It was an airplane. - How sure are you about that? It was a Danish Piper PA-28 Cherokee. The witness must have seen wrong. There was no witness! I hacked SMHI and the measurements said that the UFO would land right there! What would I have done? Your fucking amateur methods don't work! Come on, we gotta get it up before the crutches... ...before the mongrel tells the police where we are. Are you so deluded that you believe more in these geeks than me? These geeks are my friends. What happened to Gunnar? Friends? You mean freaks? They do not lie and behave like a selfish fucking brat. Gunnar was right. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I can see why you hang with them. No normal person could like you! Fuck that, fool. We're just packing stuff up that can be connected to us. Then we get ready for departure. Drive... You will be placed in a juvenile home. Considering what you've done... it might be a good thing. It'll be fine. Stop the car... It's the same plan! Stop the car! - What are you talking about? - Stop the car! Take it easy! Stop it! What the hell are you doing? Denise, do you hear me? Stop it! Hello, 7-15, can you hear me? Over. We need an ambulance at 7-15, over. Tomi... Tomi? Tomi! Tomi! Did you find what you were looking for? The coffee boils. Somebody check. if there are any mazarines in the freezer? DK-2342. Disappeared over the Baltic Sea in 1978. The same plane that came out of the red glow. Just like Dad's car! It's all connected! Töna, will you get the sugar? Dad figured it all out! He knew exactly where the UFO would appear before it did. Maybe the weatherman can understand Dad's calculations. We can do the same. I can't do this without you. I thought you said you didn't need any freaks. If anyone's a freak... that's me. Sorry. Who still wants to find answers? Need help counting your hands? Or can you do it yourself? I think Denise is right. We have to go through Kicki to have a chance of understanding this. I will not allow you to pull down the Association into the dirt again. - That's what we all say here. - Of course we do. So therefore... - Do we sign in at the entrance, or? - I think that bridge is burned for me. I know another way. Ladies first. Wait, wait, wait. What's over there? It's just storage. In this case, the vacuum cleaner the fattest internet connection in the country. Come... Fuck! It's your year on the lock. Windows NT 4.0. This one hasn't even been released yet. I want the black box digitised... You've done some rearranging up here, haven't you? - Let go of me! - One minute is all I ask. You want me to get fired, you fucking tinfoil hat? Would you like me to remind you who turned me in? - I was just doing my job. - I'm sorry. I didn't know that gossip exchange was part of that job description. I didn't know that ill-advised lunatic was part of yours. Stop it! Will you get a grip? and stop acting like children? We just want to have a chat. If the management finds out you're here I'm screwed. - Nobody saw us, it's fine. - And we're not gossips. Get a grip. Can you, please? just look at this? We just want your thoughts on it. If you don't come up with anything, we'll leave. What kind of nonsense is that? Why is dU2 defined as the eigentime derivative? What? That would mean that Y is equal to dT... instead of Ui... Lennart, this is genius. Thank you. I need to get this into our system. If Uno's equation is correct, we should be able to figure out what we're dealing with. - Do you know this system? - You can fathom it. Update the latest algorithm with Uno's equation. How to feed the database with the latest weather forecasts. What can I do? Coffee... Can you fix it? We were supposed to we should have scheduled a formal meeting - regarding the post of President. But I already have some ideas about restructuring. I don't want just anyone to run in here and start steering and setting. - Have a mazarin. - Thank you, that's fine. Have a mazarin, I say! This ghost hunt, it's cost us almost everything. And we haven't found anything. Looks like we found something. - I mean something, Karl. - So am I. And we just let her go! - What are you doing? Sit down. - Denise needs us. Get a grip! We're having coffee here! This, it goes against all our statutes. If you go there now, you'll never see me again! Yes, you hear what I say. Then you can make your own damn coffee. I still prefer tea. I would like to leave an anonymous tip. UFO Sweden... is going to blow up SMHI tonight. Make sure to cage the whole damn bunch. Can these devices figure out what that has caused the gravitational anomalies? We'll soon find out. Ready! What have you done wrong? - Did you enter the equation as it was written? - Yes, I did. - You said you hadn't been detected. - We were not discovered! - Gunnar, you son of a bitch... - You have to get out of here. Give me two more minutes! - Did it snow on Christmas Eve? - I don't know. It's in the weather forecast, isn't it? Are the machines based on your forecasts or from actual measurement data? - Kicki, where do you have all the measurement data? - You should know. Good. Stay here. I'm going down to the archives and get you everything you need. - It's crawling with cops. - That's good. I hate being alone. Clear the building! The building must be vacated! The facility is under bomb threat! Why would anyone bomb SMHI? - Are you ready? - Yes. Give us the values for -94 and -95. -94 seems to be correct. -95 you have to adjust down RF 20%... Gävle, Malmö and Säter. Wind strength in the same year in Ullared and Kiruna 10 mps, not 8. Space! Space! Norrköping, Christmas Eve -95. No snow. - It's unbelievable! - What? What do you see? Gravity anomalies is an Einstein-Rosen bridge. What bridge? - A wormhole. - Wormhole? What are you talking about? Einstein's general theory of relativity - - describes a possible scenario of interconnected black holes - wormholes. Extremely strong gravity... can bend the universe and create a shortcut between two points. The problem is just our world is not two-dimensional. It consists of four dimensions. Width, length, depth, time. It is impossible to create a wormhole without other times and places coming together. Our forecasts are wrong because they've switched places! Wait. So Dad's car and the plane... ended up where they ended up because of a wormhole? Then why wasn't he in the car? Because he got off - of those who created it. So... Dad's alive? Polis! Open the door! Don't come in! We're armed! - What are you doing? - Thinking over so we can find the next wormhole. Open up! - You're not going to try to find it there, are you? - Yes, I'm going to try to find my dad. Polis! Polis! This place is getting cleared out! What has happened here? Well, what the hell happened here? Stop! Stop! Stop! Jump! Polis! Stop! Tomi... It's all in the game. I know what happened to Dad. Uno was right. Tomi, listen to me, please... Hop in! Enforce! - They're not in! - You said "enforce"! - Well, step on it! - I'll do it, but I won't get there! Protection! Show your hands! Do we have a plan B? Greetings, earthlings! The Galactic Federation has arrived. - Third orb from the sun... - No, no! What the hell are they doing? Are they trying to help us? Called to call on Alpha Centauri. We come in peace! Weapons! Gunnar was right. It's Dad's car. - Come on out! - No! No! You got a cigarette to offer, or what? - What are we doing? - This and the car in the barn are the same car! How? Duty of care! Have you even started practice driving? The wormhole took the plane forward in time, and the car backwards - to the barn! This car will end up in the wormhole. It's the only way it all makes sense! It doesn't have to happen tonight. It could happen years from now. Didn't think of that... Push the clutch down, give it some gas, turn on the starter... I know how to do it! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! - All units are waiting. I'm on it. - Copy that. Be smart now, girl... About this car is gonna end up in the barn... then it is impossible that the will crash into the street here, is it? We don't know. Is there anything you've taught me, Denise, it's that knowing is one thing... but believing is something else entirely. No! Lennart? It's all right. I just have to... Are you okay? We have to find Dad before they take him. Come on! Get up! No, no! I must rest. I'm resting just a little first... Just a little. Okay... Stay here, and I'll find Dad. Then we'll take the car back to the barn. Dad... Dad! Daddy! Dad... Dad! I'm here! It's me, Sputnik! Denise! They're waiting for me! You were never coming back. Hurry up! The wormhole is about to collapse! Come on, then! Come on, then! You hate being alone! I am not alone! Lennart! Lennart! Lennart! Get a grip! The wormhole is collapsing. We have to get to the car before it disappears into the barn! You came back. We tinfoil hats stick together, don't we? Look... Did we include any report forms? Greetings, stranger. Where am I? What year is it? The year of grace, anno 1361. Fucking fat blood! - Are these vials? - Denise... Shit fries, you're really bleeding. Denise... Anders, call an ambulance! - He's bleeding! - Denise! - Off lajv! Off lajv! - Denise! Denise! Denise! Denise! UFO Sweden, you speak with field investigator Karl. Guys, that's three new membership applications. - Not a bad piss, is it? - No. Well, well, well! You would not be printed until next week. If anyone asks, I'm not here. Is there any coffee? I can't get another sip down of hospital tar. - Hey, this was in the box. - Wow... I'll take that. I'm just working on something. Does it possibly have to do with the unlikely coincidence - - ...that we of infinite places and times... - fell out right here, right now? Maybe we got help. - What...? Of...? - The table is set! - Who helped us? - You don't want answers. - Tell me now. What...? - Coffee first, Lelle! - What have you seen? - Come on, old man. Anybody want some buns? Can I have a plate? - Can I have two of these? - One of each, in case there are more. Texting: Karina Berg Johanson Swedish Media Text
