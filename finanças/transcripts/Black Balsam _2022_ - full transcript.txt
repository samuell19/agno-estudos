[Bill] Uh, yeah. And it's quarter after. Okay. I'm going to call her. [chuckles] Yeah, well, uh, there's no cell reception in the middle of town. Guess I'm not going to call her then. Oh! That's her. She has a sign. [chuckle] -Hi! -I am so sorry I'm late. Oh, you wouldn't believe it. My car's broken down. It's a new car. Twice in the past two weeks. Oh, no. I'm so sorry to hear. -I'm Ellen. -I'm Kimberly. And this is my husband, Bill. -[Bill] Pleasure. -Very nice to meet you. Is the cell reception this bad everywhere? -[laugh] I'm afraid so, yeah. -[Ellen chuckles] Well, why don't you hop in our car? [soft music playing] [Kimberly] There's three resorts within about 45 minutes of here. It offers skiing, snowboarding, sledding, tubing. -Bill's an avid snowboarder. -Yeah. On the map, the resorts look closer. It's on the other side. We past the turn up there on the left. Um, it's maybe five miles as the crow flies, but the cabin is up here on Black Balsam Knob, Oh, secluded. [Kimberly] The cabin sits on 98 forest filled acres. No nosy neighbors. The price includes the acreage, the cabin, and there's a couple outbuildings on the property as well. -All of it? -All of it. -And the stuffed animals? -[Kimberly and Ellen laughs] It-- that is kind of a sore spot. I asked the man that lives there to put some of them away, but he's a taxidermist and apparently very proud of his works. That just seems, uh, so counterproductive if you're trying to sell your house. He's not the one selling it. It's a-- it's a trust sale. Um, so it's been so challenging getting anything done in any sort of traditional sense. A trust sale. Oh, I didn't see that. You know what, that is-- it's just kind of a long story. But the woman that lived there for many years, she did-- she passed away. [soft music playing] -[gravel crunches] -[GPS jingles] ♪ Not again. [trunk slams shut] [grunts] Oh, God. God, that's another 100 bucks out the window. [Kimberly] [scoffs] Like I don't have a key. ♪ It feels like we're a million miles from civilization. Ah, it feels like a million miles, but we're only five! Guys, wait till you see the property. -Oh, my God. -[Kimberly] [indistinct] [Bill sighs] It's a real fixer upper. -Shh, shh. -Okay. [car doors slam shut] So you know, the new owners could maybe trim some trees, a fresh coat of paint. This house has great bones. It just-- it hasn't been updated, ever. So, come on, let's go check it out. I feel like now would be a good time to mention something. This listing has been-- it's been a bit tricky. Martha and her son, Wes, had, um, a difficult relationship. She was apparently fed up with his freeloading, and so instead of deeding everything to him, she's basically selling it out from under him. [Ellen] So he's getting kicked out? [Kimberly] Mm-hmm. [Bill] Why are you telling us this? [Kimberly] The longer the house doesn't sell, the longer he can live here. Don't expect the house to be staged with sugar cookies and classical music. [crows cawing] -[knocks on door] -[Kimberly] Hello. It's Kimberly from Mountaintop Reality. We're here for the showing. ♪ [door creaks] [intriguing music playing] Well, I did say not to expect sugar cookies, right?

I don't know what I just saw. -Watch your-- -Owner's son, right? [Kimberly] Uh, yeah, I'm sorry, he must have forgotten about this showing. This is worth the price of admission. [door slams shut] [peaceful music playing] -It's like free therapy, right? -[Bill] Yeah. Hey, you know what? The last buyers paid for an inspection report that basically says this house is in great shape. Then why didn't they go through with the purchase? Oh, they pulled out. Um, their loan, didn't go through. [Ellen] Oh, what's, uh, what's that down there? Oh, that is the old carriage house. It's filled with a lot of Wes's junk. He's got a lot of stuff to clean up before he sells this place. I'll tell you what, if you guys buy this place, I will pay for someone to come and clean up, and clean up all of Wes's junk. This would be so great for us to get away. And especially wonderful for the holidays. I know how much you want your turn at holidays things and-- -and the inspection helps. -Yeah. We don't have to pay someone to tell us that this is a trap. It's not a trap. There's just a couple things here and there and she even said there's nothing major that needs to be done. Except the aesthetics, the taxidermy, all that crap in the barn. We can get $200 a night for this. That's what she said. So? So? [Kimberly] Well, what did you guys think of the place? This guy's not going to give us any trouble? Absolutely not. He has no say in the matter. Oh, it's exactly what we're looking for. Yeah, as long as it doesn't come with Wes and all his dead stuff. [laughs] And-- and his party girls. We'd be moved in by Christmas. [Bill] Oh, it's a lot of work. The kids would love this place. And think about how we've been wanting to catch up with them. Really catch up. [Bill] The kids are living their own lives now. But I know how much making new memories together means to you. Us. ♪ This place would allow us to disconnect from what doesn't matter... and reconnect with everything that does. And then you and I could have some time alone finally, before they arrive.

These documents are really old. This looks like a charter. -Charter? -[Bill] Yeah. For land or something. It says "Goins" on it. His family's been here a long, long time. -[rock music playing on earbuds] -[eerie music continues] [birds chirping] Who did these? [Bill] I don't know. I don't like this. Goins' family has a couple of loose branches in his family tree. Yeah. I'm gonna throw all this crap away.

[chuckles] -Oh, no. -[Wes] Blood there. -[Caitlin sighs] -Well, ma'am, I'm sorry too. I-- I-- I didn't mean to walk up on you like that. I just noticed you out here. You must have stumbled out on my property from-- from wherever it was you came from. [chuckles] Are you okay? I reckon I will be. [scoffs] I mean, you should be careful with that thing, though. You know what I heard just the other day? I heard the chances of you getting hurt in altercation go much higher if you're carrying a weapon. -[Caitlin] Hmm. -Isn't that crazy? Just about bowled me backwards when I heard that. [chuckles] -I should get back. -Yeah. -Back to your family. -[Caitlin] Yeah. Your stepmom, dad, or something like that? How did you know? Stepmom? -Yes. -Oh, I'll be! I got it right. Just a guess. That's so common nowadays. Wow. But she's still your mama. [chuckles] Yeah. Uh, I need to go. Look after her. -Mamas are special. -Mm-hmm. They're light in a dark, dark world. Now, don't get too cozy up here on the ridge. Sorry, sir. [ominous music booms] [Bill] Where is the mannequin? [stick cracking] [panting] Where's your sister? She's been gone a long time. I-- I don't know. I haven't seen her. -[Ellen sighs] -[door creaks, slams shut] -[Caitlin sighing] -Where were you? Why didn't you tell me where you were going? I went for a walk, but I-- I think I might have gotten lost or something. -You all right? -Oh, my God! -You had gotten lost! -Yeah. When I was out there, I heard a branch crack, and I whipped around, and this guy... he was, like, right there. -What do you mean this guy? -Just some hunter. Said I must have been lost on his property. But he-- he said I wasn't safe and I shouldn't get too cozy out there. -That's weird. -Yeah. [sighs] I-- I am gonna go change. I'm gonna go get dressed. Where's your dad? -Where's your dad? -[Sutton] I'll look outside. [Ellen] Sutton, don't go far. That's weird. Dad? Dad, you out here? Dad? Dad? Uh, mom wants you inside.

And Sutton put that squirrel thing in my room again. Are you okay? -Bill, Bill. -Yeah. All right. We're gonna get out of here. Go pack your stuff. We're gonna be out in 30 minutes. Okay? [Ellen gasps] Now! Let's go. Come on. Chop-chop. Okay. [Bill] Gone in 30 minutes. Let's go. [breathing heavily] [birds cawing] [eerie music playing] We should just go. This guy is playing games to scare us, and I don't care to play his game anymore. [car engine stalls] -Hey, do you have the fob? -No. [Bill] Ah, shit! [Sutton] One of my hoses must have frozen overnight. -I-- I can't-- -Well, you can pile into our car. We-- we left the fob in the kitchen. All right. -Whoa, slow down. There we go. -[Sutton panting] There you go. Let's go. [Ellen] Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [Ellen mutters] -[Ellen] What? -What? Ours isn't working either. -Nothing. It's dead. -[Ellen] What-- what?
