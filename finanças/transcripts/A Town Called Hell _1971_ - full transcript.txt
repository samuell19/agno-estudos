(distant bell tolling) (tense orchestral music) (bell tolling) (tense orchestral music) (funereal orchestral music) (somber organ music) (funereal orchestral music) - Soldiers, before I return to my church, I would like to congratulate you personally. These were no more than the scum of the Earth. The ones who bit the hands that fed them. Therefore, let this be a lesson to all thieves. (bell tolling) - Aguila! (mysterious shrill music) (funereal orchestral music) We will bury these miserable ones outside the walls of our church, in unconsecrated ground. For them, there is no salvation. No. Let them burn in hell! Viva Mexico! (shrill music) - Aguila! (gunshots blasting) (adventurous music) (gunshots blasting) (adventurous orchestral music) (gunshots blasting) Aguila! (gunshots blasting) (adventurous music) (gunshots blasting) Aguila! (adventurous orchestral music) (distant gunshots blasting) (women screaming) (gentle choral music) (gunshots blasting) (women screaming) (women whimpering) (gentle choral music) - [Man] It's Aguila. - Viva la Revolucion! (gunshots blasting) (gunshots blasting) (gentle choral music) (bell tolling) (somber music) (gentle choral music) Long live the poor. (footsteps pattering) (gentle choral music) What do we do about this? - Padre. - Sancho, please! (gunshots blasting) (thrilling music) (priest groans) (angel crashes) (gunshot blasting) - Altar! (gunshots blasting) - [Man] Viva Mexico! - Viva Mexico! - Viva la Revolucion! Viva Mexico! (gunshots blasting) (men shouting) (man laughing) (hands clapping) (man laughing) (men shouting) (solemn choral music) (carriage wheels clattering) (solemn choral music) - Wake up. (solemn choral music) We're almost there. Whatever happens, you do what I tell you. (solemn choral music) (horse hooves pattering) (solemn choral music) (suspenseful orchestral music) (tense music) (gate clatters) (tense music) (body sliding) (tense music) - The Americans say that they're lost. (tense music) (boot thuds) (boot thumps) (tense music) (coins rattle) - You can keep it. (man laughing) - Thank you. Thank you very much. (laughs) Bomba! (tongue clicks) Let them drink. Here. Drink. Now search them. (tense music) (coin thumping) - Nothing. - The belts. The belts! (belts rattling) (coin rattling) Hello. (Don Carlos chuckles) (tense music) Hmm. (paper rustling) What's this? - Just a piece of paper. Verification paper. Nothing important. (gunshot blasting) (metal clanging) (somber instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (gunshot blasting) (bell clanging) - Thank you. (suspenseful music) (gunshot blasting) (bell clanging) (suspenseful music) - Why don't you answer your bell, priest? Read it. (suspenseful music) I said, read it. - What are you doing here? - I asked you to read it, priest. - "The bearer of this document is a serving officer in the United States Army on official business to the established, established, Mexican government of President Porfirio Diaz. - The Mexican government? They don't like us, so they send soldiers here to try to kill us. And you, you do business with them? - We do business with everyone. We just want to help. - You hear that, priest? The Americans, they just want to help. (laughs) Let me welcome you to Bastardo. Perla, Carmina! - Si, Don Carlos. - Bomba, you see to our guests. (tense music) You disapprove, priest? You're a hard man. Everyone deserves a good woman before he dies, no? (Don Carlos laughs) Only for you, priest, the woman? Or maybe you don't approve of the way Carmina and Perla give the last rites! Hypocrite! Judas! (footsteps pattering) (Don Carlos laughs) (suspenseful music) (boots thudding) (suspenseful music) (gunshot blasting) (planks snapping) (man laughing) (gunshot blasting) (horse hooves pattering) (adventurous music) (ominous organ music) (horse hooves pattering) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (tense music) - I wish to visit my husband's grave. - Coffin is empty. - You cannot remove a buddy without paying for it. - I can pay for it. - Bomba, show the lady to the cemetery, huh? (horse hooves pattering) (tense music) All right, priest. - Man that is born of a woman has but a short time to live and is full of misery. In the midst of life we are in death. We have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep and have left undone those things we should have done. (suspenseful music) We should have done, we have done those things, which we ought not to have done, and there is no helping us. (suspenseful music) - Please, please. - We therefore commit these bodies to the grave. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Looking for the resurrection of the body, when the earth shall give up the dead. Amen. - Amen. (shovels thudding) - My husband, how did he die? - I don't remember, Senora. I don't even remember him. - It was not so long ago. - You want me to dig him up? - No. That's not why I came here. - And why did the Senora come? - To give someone in this town $20,000 in gold. - And who in this town could be so lucky? I mean, what would he have to do? - All he would have to do is say one word. The name of the man who killed my husband. - You have the gold with you? - I'm not so foolish. The money will only be paid when the body of that man reaches El Paso across the American border, and me with it, alive. Now do you remember who killed my husband? - I shall make it my concern. (chuckles) La Bomba! - Si. - Take the Senora to the hotel and see that we, and see that she gets a nice clean room. (suspenseful music) - Friend. (Don Carlos laughs) - Hello, friend! - He is a deaf mute. (suspenseful music) (gun clicking) (gunshots blasting) (tense music) (object crashing) (tense music) - Jose! Why do you hide from your good friend Don Carlos, huh? Come, come, come. Jose, you've forgotten your bottles. Calebra, Jose has forgotten his bottles. So terribly hot, huh? Shade nice. So much drink. - I bought them, with my share of the money. - How much did Jose get? - 10 pesos. - I beg you, Don Carlos. I found it under the table. - Up. Up! (tense music) - La Bomba, Calebra, you are my friends! Why you do this to me? (man laughs) (Jose mutters) - Jose, now you will pay for those drinks. (laughs) - Shake him. - Please, don't do this to me. Calebra, La Bomba, help me! - Shall we have the truth or do you want to hang up there until you start stinking? - My sister. My puta sister, La Perla. She is the one that gave them to me. I don't steal the money, I tell you the truth! - (laughs) Now your money is all gone. - Get La Perla. (woman groans) - I swear to you, I didn't take the money. - How about you, angel? Was the $100 in your room? Your dowry perhaps? - I told you, I know nothing about it. This guy who calls himself my brother, he put it there. (shouting in foreign language) - She took it, I saw her! Let me kill her myself! (water splashing) (man laughing) - I'm dying. Please. Calebra, let me down. I will do anything. - Remember that when Carlos returns! - No, oh! (groans) (suspenseful music) - Stop, thief! Animal, I will tear your eyes out! (man grunts) - Hey amigos, shall we hang the mother too! (man barks) (man grunting) (woman groaning) (man grunting) (tense music) (man grunting) - Pedro! (hand slapping) (gentle choral music) (rifle cocking) (gentle choral music) - Muy bonito. My favorite color, black. (footsteps pattering) - All right. Now you tell the Senora what you told me. (woman spitting) (lips smacking) (woman groaning) - I will tell you, Don Carlos. She will not speak even to save my life. But I will tell you, I will tell you everything. Senora, she killed your husband. She stole your money too! (woman shouting) Let her die! - You're a liar! - Si, si! - Then you could prove it, huh? By killing her, just push. - Please, Don Carlos. - All right, then you please, dear. You'll kill him, you push him. No, no, please, commander, I will do it. - (groans) Oh no! (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (woman shouting in foreign language) - Padre, Padre, help me! - Hey. - Padre. Padre! - I can't bring back the dead. (dramatic organ music) (woman whimpers) - Tell me, Jose, how many men have you killed? - 10, maybe 12, I don't remember. I only obey orders, Carlos. I only obey my orders. - I know, Jose. And you helped your sister to kill the Senora's husband. - If you say so, Carlos. (hand slapping) - I don't want you to say if I say so. Just say yes or no. Did you help to kill him? - Yes. I helped to kill him. - Oh. (hand patting) Okay. There! (rope creaking) Now there, is the Senora satisfied? They hate each other! Now you want the two bodies, or will just one do for the coffin? - [Mother] Butcher, murderer! Judas! You promised their lives if they will tell the lies you wanted! - Crazy. - Murderers! I know who kill your husband! Aguila! (gunshots blasting) Aguila! (dramatic music) - Aguila? - There's no such person. That woman, she's crazy. - Now you have to kill her. - [Don Carlos] First her gold. - [Man] I haven't seen any gold, only a coffin. (door creaking) (somber music) - Did you know my husband? - I know you. - We've never met. - But I know you. - [Senora] The old woman said Aguila killed my husband. - To be a revolutionary, one must be prepared to be violent. - How do you know me, Father? - Bad dreams getting worse. - What do you dream about, Father? - You have a knife, you come into my room. (suspenseful music) You put the knife into my back. She. Roll over, comforts me. - Why should I want to kill you? - If I knew that, I'd stop dreaming of you. - You know why I'm here? - Let your husband rest. - How do I rest? Tell me how? - I don't know. Go while you can. - When I leave, there will be a body in the coffin that came with me. - Be sure it isn't your own. Every other stranger who has come to this town has ended up in the cemetery. - Except you. - I am a priest. - Is he? Are you? (suspenseful music) (tense music) (tense music) (horse whinnying) (tense music) (dramatic music) (man choking) (tense music) (footsteps pattering) (steps creaking) (tense music) (horse hooves pattering) (tense music) (body dragging) - Now do we kill the witch, hm?

Hey, priest! The Senora, she is with you? - Yes. - You gonna fight for her? - I fight for no one. - Ah, bueno, now you open up the door. - I said, I fight for no one! (gunshots blasting) (Don Carlos grunting) - Priest, that was a mistake! Bomba the idiot, I'm still your friend! You hear me, priest? - I hear you. - Now listen. You have little water, very little food, few bullets. How long can the Senora last, right? Now, here's what we're gonna do. The Senora offers $20,000 in gold for a dead man, right? Well, for the same price, very cheap, I'm gonna give her her life, all right. All right, just talk to her. In the meantime, we're gonna have a little truce. A little peace, huh? You hear me, priest? - Who is Aguila? - Aguila is the Revolution. - Go on. - Idiot! You watch, keep me covered. (tense orchestral music) (somber instrumental music) (gentle, romantic music) (tense music) (footsteps pattering) I thought I told you to stay outside and watch, idiot. - Francisco is watching. La Bomba, the idiot, is thirsty. - What are you doing now? (gunshot blasting) (La Bomba laughing) (gun cocking) (gunshots blasting) (gun cocking) (gunshots blasting) (chair crashing) (La Bomba laughing) (men grunting) Senora! Tell the Senora who is Aguila, tell her! - Aguila is... (tense music) - I cannot hear you, Don Carlos! - Aguila is... (thrilling music) - Dead. (horse hooves pattering) (gentle choral music) Whatever happens you stay here. Stay here! (gentle choral music) - Hernandez! Hernandez. - Benito! - Never been so glad to see a man in all my life. Let me kiss you, good friend. Good god, why are you dressed like this? You hiding or going mad? - In a sense. - What? - Passion makes history, reason hides from it. - Come with me. Put on a good clean uniform. I'll make you a lieutenant, come into my army. Three years, we'll be presidents. 10 years, we'll own Mexico. (hand patting) - Thank you. - Oh. This the last church we ever entered? - Yes it was. - You telling me you got the religion, huh? You? A priest killer? Well, well, well. Did you go mad, old friend? You ever have a church before? I mean, in Ireland, in some place? Were you ordained? - This is my only church. - Well, I got religion too. Oh yes. You're close to god, you have to love the rich. He likes them better, you see, that's why they always win. That's why I changed sides. What are you doing? - Mending. - Mending. Hernandez, old friend, perhaps you can help me. - Well, if I can. - Where is Aguila? Where is Aguila? - I'll never tell you. - What? - I said, I'll never tell you. - So, you're trying to crawl back to god, huh? - I would if I knew where to find him. - Good friend. Brother, comrade. Irishman. Catholic. So far from home, so far from the green of Ireland. I know how to torture you because I know you. - But. - But. But I know this will never back you. It will have to be through others. Where's Aguila? - I'll tell you very simply. You'll never find him through me. - Oh? Then I will hang them in order to break you. Men and women, young and old. And you will watch me from your little window, and you will be broken. - You may break me, but I'll never tell you. - I have no sentiment, old friend. I have squeezed the last drop of blood from my very bones. So don't count on the good old times. For they were mean and rotten, and I was poor then, old friend. These are the good times, and I am rich. You can join me. You can join or you can suffer. Choose now. - But I told you, I've already chosen. - So watch me from your little window. - [Priest] Benito. - Yes? - You're looking older. - So do you. (boots clacking) - It's the mayor, Excellency. (fingers snapping) - So, you're the mayor in this town, hm? - Si, Excellency. (cups clinking) - Who elected you? - It was not official. - No? - No. - Why not? - There was no voting, nobody voted. - Nevermind. I... I'm looking for the man who is known as Aguila. I have reason to believe he's here in this town. You are the mayor of this town. Is he here? - Si. On the pole outside. I caught him for you. (Colonel laughs) (cups clinking) - You're sure he is Aguila? - Sure, I know Aguila like he was my brother. (Colonel laughs) - You sure he isn't Don Carlos the bandit? (laughs) - Well, you see, Excellency. I've only been mayor since today. (Colonel laughs) And I don't. (Colonel laughs) - How would you like to be whipped 100 lashes, huh? - Oh no. - You're the mayor. How would you like to be hung from the gallows like a common peasant? - No. (rifle whacking) - Show me Aguila by tomorrow morning! - I will find him. I will find him. (speaking foreign language) (people chattering) (tense instrumental music) - I'm your friend no, Paco? I've spoken with the colonel. He's agreed to let us all go free. Only one must die. Aguila. We can all go free, listen to me. You must listen to me, Paquito. Paquito. Paquito! This is a bad day, Carmina. - You pig! - No. I can get us out of here. The right word from me to the colonel, I mean. Carmina, Carmina. Manuel and Luis, they are watching us because they are jealous. They hate us. And all we do is say that their father is Aguila. (woman spitting) (jarring instrumental music) Manuel, Luis, help me and we will go free. All we have to do is to tell the colonel who is Aguila. (hand slapping) (men grunting) (fists smashing) (men shouting) (men shouting) You are all going to die! Only one thing can save you! When we hand over Aguila to the colonel! One of you must know who he is! - [Man] Tie him up! - Senor. The colonel has asked me to do him a service. I must find Aguila, I have to find Aguila! How can I find him if I am tied up? (fist smashing) - Line them up! (dramatic music) Let Aguila step forward! (tense music) He is a coward. He refuses. Then one of you must denounce him. (dramatic music) (woman gasping) Starting tomorrow at seven, five of you will join your mayor, La Bomba, and be hanged by the neck slowly until dead. The same will happen every four hours until I have Aguila! (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - No, no, please! - Stop! Bring him here. (tense music) What's your name? (man spits) That's a brave man, I like brave men. I need brave men. You'd be wise to change masters. - Aguila too respected brave ones. (suspenseful music) (gunshot blasting) - Luis! (tense music) (dramatic music) (stools crashing) (insects chirping) (somber guitar music) - Over here. (hand banging) This way, this way! Well? - You were very kind to my son once. I have only one son, he must not die in the morning. That's why I've come here to save him. I have no one else. The good lord will bless you. - I'm not interested in the good lord, only Aguila. If you tell me what it is I want to know, you will both be spared. - Let my son be my eyes, for he too knows Aguila. - What is your son's name, old man? - [Man] Manuel Sanchez. - Manuel... - Sanchez. - Sanchez! - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Bring him here! Now. Tell me what you know of Aguila. - I was one of the first to join him over 15 years ago. You would not think to look at me now, but I was a great fighter. - Oh, one has only to look in your face to know that. - At the same time, I was one of his personal advisors. He was a great man. If he had won, there'd be no poor in this country now. - Look, I don't care to know what he would have done. Only what you know about him now. - Yes, Excellency. You see, planning the uprising was very difficult. The government forces had spies everywhere. He could not show himself to anyone for fear of being betrayed. He could only trust a few of us. We would ride at night, that's why he was called Aguila. 'Cause like an eagle he would swoop down and then be gone again. He won all battles. And then through a traitor we were defeated. I was blinded. We fled through the hills. We all split up in some of our coaches. I did not meet Aguila again. - I've been very patient, old man. Now tell me, how do you plan to deliver Aguila from where he is? How do you plan to do that? - With this. Let my fingers touch the faces of those you suspect and I will tell you if it is Aguila. (tense music) - The old woman said Aguila killed my husband. The colonel says you knew my husband. Fought with him everywhere. Yet the colonel says he did now know my husband. Tell me what is true. Won't you answer me? You know if you do not, I will have the colonel's men drag you from your church and hang you. - I have not finished. (bell tolling) (people chattering) (men shouting) (bell tolling) - Up! (bell tolling) (drums banging) - Everything is ready, Excellency. - Speak and I will give the order which will free you! (drums banging) (stools crashing) (men grunting) (somber music) - You think I should have told him. - Si. (people shouting) - Man that is born of a woman have but a short time to live and is full of misery. In the midst of life we are in death. We have erred and strayed from thy ways like lost sheep. We have left undone those things we should have done. And we have done those things, which we ought not to have done. And there is no helping us. As He forgives those who trespass against Him, let us also forgive... (man coughing) Amen. (jarring instrumental music) - [Man] Aguila! (dramatic music) Aguila, Aguila!

Shoot him. - No! I think you make a big mistake if you kill me before I speak with the general. - The general doesn't speak to scum. - I think he will when he learns what I have come to talk about. (bright classical music) - This man says he can deliver Aguila for reward. - All right, Captain, take care of him. - He says he will only talk to you, Excellency. - Pay him his money, Captain, and get all the information. - Yes, sir. Come on! - No! It is very important information. I tell it only to the general. - Tell him I will listen. - Talk! - If the general will look at me. I am after all not a cockroach. I am a man like other men. Aguila is a man too. The best one I ever know, but he cannot help me now. No one can. To be poor in Mexico is to be dead. - Aguila, where is he? - Answer the general. - If he will look at me. - [Soldier] Excellency, let me take this one outside. I will shoot him through the middle so he'll take a long time dying. Then he'll tell us about Aguila. - Go on, Capitan, take me, shoot me! Go on. - Leave us. (people chattering) Now, where will I find Aguila? I will pay you the money. - You don't have to find him. He's coming here tonight. He laid this plan for many weeks for the night of your fiesta.

Aguila. - I still don't believe it, it's too hard to believe. But then I never heard of Aguila until we parted company. That's when the legend began, yes. Well, I want to know where I can find him. There never was an Aguila. It was you all the time saying you were riding with him. What an Irish trick. (hand banging) I'll have to take you to Mexico City. You'll be tried and shot. Even if you died here, I still have to take your body there. Those are my orders, dead or alive. That's where we're at, you know. Ah, if only we could have gone to Mexico City and dined and drank and had women and celebrated. - If only we could. - Listen, why don't you just confess? Let's get it over with here and now, huh? - Why do you need a confession? - Because I have a conscience. - Then I confess everything and I deny nothing. (footsteps pattering) - You sent for me? - No, I ordered you. Here is Aguila. (dramatic music) - Did he confess? - He has not denied it. - I don't believe you. - (laughs) Believe me? (Colonel laughs) You do not believe me? So now I'm a liar? - You are a fool. - Get out! (tense music) - Will you release the other prisoners? - Not yet. - But you have Aguila. - Do I? (cup shattering) - How could you be sure? - I tended him when he had a head wound. I touch his face many times. I am sure, Senora. I'm sure. - There were two of them, Papa. - Two? - [Man] Aguila and his friend. - How do you know the wounded man was Aguila? - Papa can only be half wrong. If the priest isn't Aguila then he has to be the other man. The friend. (man coughing) (man coughing) My father is very sick. He will die. I have to take him inside. (man coughing) Por favor, Senor.

You're right. We are older. One man can bear grief in all this. It takes two to be happy. (banging) If we win you can still put on my uniform. - If we win you can put on my robe. (gunshots blasting) - I wonder what's going on out there. - Why don't you go and look, colonel? (Priest chuckles) - No, no, I like it much better here, it's cooler. Shall we be punished for our sins? - Buy them. - Shall we repent then? - They say it's easier to repent of those sins you've already committed than those you intend to commit. (gunshots blasting) - If we have won, I intend to commit a great many. - Yes. - It's over. Shall we bet? - On what? - Our souls. - I don't like the odds.

He couldn't have gone on, couldn't fight anymore! - Who killed him? - Your man was crippled. - He could've come back to me. - That was not what he wanted. "Let the living die," he said, "so the dead can live." - How do you know what he wanted? He loved me. (gentle choral music) - He loved the people. "Let my body die," he said. "So that my spirit can live!" He pulled himself up onto his knees. He put his pistol into my hand! He shouted "Viva!" Pulled that pistol against his brain. He begged me fire it. "Let my name go on like the eagle," he said. "Let every rich man in Mexico wake up screaming "when the poor cry Aguila, Aguila, Aguila!" So I pulled the trigger. With no act of mine. The terrible thing is that since I did it for him it's all seemed to me quite useless. I too had ideals. Since I killed him, I've lost them. I've no longer been concerned with the just nor the free. But simply and solely with this. Just wanted to mend this! This was all that I have been able to accomplish. - Murderer. - Yes! - The devil always wants to play God. - The devil has the largest congregation.
