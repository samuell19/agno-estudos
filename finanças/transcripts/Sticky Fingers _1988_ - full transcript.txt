Take it like that. So who's this one? A shoe designer from Paris. EVANSTON: So how much money did you lose today? LOLLY: $37. They took it right out of our hand. EVANSTON: Out of your hand? Didn't I tell you not to keep money in your hand? I don't wear a bra. I don't need a bra. I wear a bra to have a safe place to keep my money. Not hungry today? I can't eat donuts. Tofu donuts. Evanston, darling, don't forgetthe Gray Panther benefit tomorrow night, 7:00. EVANSTON: I never do. Hattie, can't you call Michael and get us some jingles work? Selling dishwashing detergent is not my idea of playing music. We could ask him. Lolly, I don't do jingles. You don't do floors and windows either. Who's Michael? Uh, my husband. We're separated. LOLLY: When did you visit a psychic? HATTIE: Jean-Marc took me. She did this visualization on my aura and she saw money around me. Lots of it. She said it was clear my life was gonna change any moment. What else could that mean but work? I mean, every time I'm down to my last $200, I always get a job. What job? HATTIE: Detail. Stella, when are we gonna have hot water? He went to get a pot. Well, buzz me when I could wash. [VEHICLE RUMBLING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Did you get my note? -Hi, Stella. -What note? How's your leg? Don't try to change the subject. Did you get my note? Yes, I did get your note and, um, I wrote you a note back. Did you get my note? Don't you ask me what I asked you. I hate that. Now, you are two months behind in your rent. Your check bounced. Stella, guess who I met last week? Steven Eidy's brother-in-law's niece and she said that she can get you that autographed picture -that you want. -STELLA: Oh, are you kidding? -No. -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No more promises. No. HATTIE: Uh, Stella, we're trying to go in a new direction with our music. We're making it much more accessible. Yeah, all we need is one hit song. STELLA: I want my rent. That's it. Now, you two have been taking advantage of me ever since I've been in the hospital and I hate that. Now, one more week and you're out. -Stella. -One week? You got to give us more time than that. Stella, the restaurant where I worked blew up. I'm having a residual check come in any day now. Oh, don't give me no more song cues. WOMAN: Stella, can you see the brackets? -Is it lined up? -Move it to the right. More. Move it. To the right. More. -I'm moving it to my right, -STELLA: Some more, more. Stella. This is my right. STELLA: That's fine. Let it go. How does it look? [GASPS] [POTS BREAKING] It's perfect. This is perfect. Woo. I have got to get out of this city. You know, people are trying to rip me off. I mean, people ripped off my ring. Somebody came in my house and ripped off my mother's ringsof 10 generations. -That's terrible. -Uh-hmm. You're telling me. You can't trust nobody. You know, me and Joey, we broke up. -No. -Yeah. He got this temper. Well, my psychic, she's clairvoyant. She told me he was psychotic. [CHUCKLES] Well, tell me something new. What's wrong with him is he was a tree in another life and his consciousness is closed. -He was a what? -DIANE: A tree. He needs to get in touch with his spiritual guides. Not to say that any of my friends are really in touch with their spiritual guides. But, you know, I can visualize things and I visualized that he was gonna try to kill me. And I thought about getting hima crystal or something, but I thought, "No, that's not what I need." You see, what I need is peace and serenity because there is just too much confusion in this world. No, that is just too many missiles and it's too easy for somebody to push the button, and then the whole thing fucking. You mean whole fucking thing? DIANE: That's what I said. Here you go. You can count it if you want. Girl, you know I trust you. Thanks for bringing it by. -DIANE: Uh-hmm. -HATTIE: Hmm, smells great. DIANE: Yeah, and it was hard to come by, too. Hattie, we have a concert to do in the park. -You better get dressed. -HATTIE: Oh, yeah. Right. Listen, Di, have a safe trip. DIANE: Uh-hmm. Oh, shit.

I'll take care of everything. It's okay, sugar. Okay. Bye. [SIGHS] Oh. Sorry, I had to give out your number. Lo, uh, could you keep this bag for me? The damn thing is just so heavy. I don't wanna throw out my bag, dragging it around all day. Well, what's in it? DIANE: Nothing. Just a few things I didn't wanna leave at home. You don't mind, do you? -Well, I-- -I mean, if you mind, I'll just ask Hattie. It's no big deal. I mean, we go way back, she and I. -Well, sure. Yeah. -DIANE: Oh, great. I'll just put it out of your wayand then I'll be on mine. [LAUGHS] You cannot imagine how much this is gonna just help me out. Oh. [LAUGHS] Oh, now, I won't have to even go and see my chiropractor. And Lo, make sure nothing happens to it. -See you in a few days, Lo. -Loll. -DIANE: Huh? -It's Loll. DIANE: It's Loll. [SCOFFS] Forget it. [SCOFFS] You know, life is just too short. Tsk. A friend of mine just got hit. LOLLY: Hit? By a car? By a gun. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] HATTIE: Did she leave? Yeah. God, that woman can talk. Hattie, how can you buy grass when we have to pay the rent? It wasn't mine except for the change. I'm buying it for Martin, Kim, Lisa, Steve, Wayne, Crazy Carol, Karen, and Carol. That way, I can keep a few buds for myself and it doesn't cost me anything. What's her bag doing in the closet? Oh, she asked if she could leave it here for a few days. -Well, what's in it? -I don't know. Well, how could you let her leave it here without knowing what was in it? I asked. HATTIE: Hey, Loll, what do you think of this? Uh, it's too tight. HATTIE: Thank you for sharing. God, I hate being poor. I hate it. -What? -HATTIE: Loll, do you have my shoulder pads? Uh, yeah. Hattie, I didn't mean it. HATTIE: It's okay, Loll. No, really. Um, I never would've. I mean, I swear I didn't know. HATTIE: Loll, it's okay. Honest. Just ask me next time. I know you're gonna be mad at me. I know you. HATTIE: Will you stop? I'm not mad. Hit by a gun. Hit by a gun. I gained weight well, huh? Tell me the truth. Do I look fat to you? Hattie, it's awful. Yeah, I know. I've been anxious lately, but, I mean, it's kind of rubenesque, isn't it? It's not so bad. It's bad. [SOBS] Well, just stop beating. Well, you don't have to be so รท|agreeable about it. No, not--[SOBS] see what the--no, it's--no, she-- HATTIE: What is the matter with you? Well--[SOBS] uh, what-- Hattie, Hattie. Hattie, look. What's this? It's Diane's. Holy shit. Is this real? I think so. Oh, no. No. I don't believe this. How could you let her leave anything here? What's the matter with you? -Well, she's your friend. I-- -She's not my friend. She's my dope dealer. I thought she was a lawyer. No, she used to be.She wasn't making enough money. [SOBS] What do we got to do? How could you let her leave anything here? We don't have any doorman, there's no security. We're gonna have to get it back to her. [DOORBELL BUZZING] HATTIE: Where is she? Come on, Diane. What kind of name is Jankowitz? Polish. Polish people aren't black. Maybe she married a Polish man -and that's her married name. -She's not married. Well, maybe she just hated the name she was born with and decided to change her name. Lolly, focus, focus. We got to get inside. Or maybe she's just, you know, being different and thought it was really cool to have it here -just to kind of... -Well, maybe if you just try -and let me handle this, okay? -Can you hold this? I'm going in. I'll be right back. Oh. Oh my Goddess. Oh my Goddess. Oh, oh. Oh my Goddess. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. [SCREAMS] -Miss. -It's not my fault, officer. Take it. Keep it. I don't want it. -It's not even mine. -Well, thanks. But I don't think it'll match my outfit. Debbie. Debbie. Debbie, Debbie, why aren't you answering me? What seems to be the problem, officer? It seems your friend here is... HATTIE: Oh, Debbie and I aren't friends. Our kids play together. And where have you been, Lisa? Taking care of the kids, Debbie. Oh. POLICEMAN: What you got in there, Debbie? Machine gun? HATTIE: No, just a case full of money. [THUNDER RUMBLES] HATTIE: What are you doing? LOLLY: I'm making sure each pack is $2,000 in it. Okay. Look. I put $450,000 here and with this, that's $450,000 here. $900,000 cash. $900,000. It's a little under a million. HATTIE: Yeah. LOLLY: Where the hell did you get all this? Selling pot.

We thought you were Stella. -Stella? -Yeah, you know, from downstairs. -The super-- -Yeah, I know Stella. She gave me a message for you. It's an eviction notice. She thought it might bea little easier coming from me. Hey. Don't worry about this whole money thing. HATTIE: Money thing? What money thing? I'm not worried about money. You, Loll? Money? Me? No. I mean,I'm worried but not about money. Well, my friend Geraldine has a brother who works at Brooklyn Academy in the box office and he heard about this audition for live musicians. For who? Tanya Blue. And he has a friend that's a friend of the producers and he said he might be able to get us an audition. Thanks for the dress. It was a big hit. It's a little wrinkled. I'll hang it in the closet. [SIREN WAILING] SAM: I don't have the apartment anymore. LOLLY: What do you mean? SAM: The guy that's living hereis coming back. LOLLY: You just moved in. SAM: I even had a copy of the key made for you today. I was gonna give it to you but what's the point? LOLLY: Well, that's okay. I'll take the key. I don't know where I'm gonna move to or anything. Everything seems to be happening at the same time. Well, let me have the key. Oh, honey, I got to be out of here in two weeks. What's the point? I want the key, Sam. Give me the key. SAM: Wow. You wanna just drop it? I mean, do you want some chocolate or something? I want the key. -Why? -Well, what if something should happen to me? -Are you okay? -LOLLY: Give me the key, Sam.

Loll, it's Marcie. -Marcie, what are you doing? -I know it's late but I'm very upset. I'm in a lot of pain. Do you care? Yeah, I care. Just a second. Okay? -Are you sure? -Yeah, I'm pretty sure. Just a second. Loll, it's Marcie. She said she wants to talk to me. What do you think? I mean, you know, I mean I know it's late. I'm very upset. Well, yeah. Sure. Excuse me. I'll just be back in a minute. LOLLY: Marcie came over last night. HATTIE: Again? LOLLY: Yeah, she's obsessed. She dumped him but she thinks she can have him back just like that. HATTIE: What is with her? You've been together for two years. HATTIE: You know I saw her huddled up hiding on the exit stairs across the hall from his apartment? And the other night, she was sleeping on the roof. LOLLY: I can't take it anymore. HATTIE: What did Sam say? LOLLY: Nothing. HATTIE: Have you said anything to him? Well, -I mean I should. -Uh-hmm. I know I should, okay? I'm not an idiot. No, I haven't said anything. It's like the words get stuck in my throat. My voice changes. It gets higher. Your problem is you're too nice. You got to learn to say no. If you said no to Diane, we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. I know. Loll, you got to stand up for yourself. Hold your head straight. -I know. -My dad, he was showing me this picture of the whole family. I mean, everyone. Brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, everybody. And all the men standing in the picture are holding their heads straight. Real confident. Real direct. And all the women were standing holding our heads tilted to the side like this. Like, we don't know how to hold our heads straight. You're right. I'm gonna talk to him. [CLINKING] Someone's here. In the bathroom. [HAMMERING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] You wanna scream, too? No, thank you. HATTIE: What are you doing? Well, what does it look like we're doing? You left your faucets on when the water was shut off. Yeah, and it leaked right through the ceiling in 4A. -Didn't it, honey? -Yes, it did. Oh, I'm sorry. -We didn't know. -I mean, you couldn't have known because the water was off. Am I not right? -Uh-hmm. -Oh, I love that crystal. Don't. Please don't touch my crystal. You know, I've been thinking about maybe doing some remodeling here, you know, some linoleum maybe and some vinyl in. Yeah, you know, you could take the moldings off, help update the lines. Make it more modern. That would be nice. It would give it a more Mediterranean feel of the place. NANCY: Hello. Hello. Hello. -Hello. -And now what about stucco? It's so Santa Fe. I mean the space really lends itself to that desert feel, don't you think? Well, now, wait a minute, don't I have the right apartment? Isn't this 5A, the two-bedroom with the skylight in the bathroom? Yes. Oh my God. It's fantastic. Oh, skylights really work wonders, don't you think? Oh, wait. Who are you? Well, I'm Nancy. I talked to you on the phone this morning. You're Stella, right? -Not quite. -STELLA: I'm Stella. Oh. Well, my husband said if I love it, take it. Well, I love it. So I'm gonna take it. Will you excuse us? LOLLY: Be right back. NANCY: This place has so much potential. LOLLY: Hattie, what are you doing? You can't do that. She took an ad out in the paper, she's renting it out from under us. We can't touch it, Hattie. It's not ours. We have to figure out something else. -Can't you ask your parents? -They don't have anything and you don't have any parents to ask. We have no choice. -But it's stealing. -It is not. We are not thieves. We are simply borrowing it. Diane would want us to take some of it so that we have an apartment to keep the bag. We will pay back every single cent. I promise. Move. Stella, say hello to March and April. You know how it is. You have to tempt fate every once in a while, throw caution to the wind, rob from Peter to pay Paul and hope that Diane will understand. [WHISTLES] HATTIE: "Who Makes The Coffee?"First novel by Sam Goodman. Lolly, whose idea was this cake? -LOLLY: Sam's. -WOMAN: I hope no one from Ms. Magazineis here.

[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Hattie, I can't stop thinking about the thing. -What thing? -The thing, the new thing. Do you think we should've left the thing at home alone? Hey, love, relax. It's fine, okay? Just don't worry about it. Enjoy the party. Yeah, but do you think we did the right thing -by taking part of it? -Well, I told you we're gonna pay backevery single cent with interest. Now relax. Go dance with Sam. Let's have a good time, okay?

[LAUGHING] What's she doing here? SAM: I guess she knows somebody or something. I don't know. You. She knows you. I didn't know how to tell you. She called a couple of nights ago. I mean, it's like a coincidence and it seems that she got a job in the PR office that's handling the book. I mean, it just happened a couple of days ago. It's a coincidence that Marcie'syour press agent? She's not my press agent yet. She's not my press agent now. She just got a job at the office there. That cake is violence against women.

They've stolen it, it was priceless, it belonged to my grandmother! Where is it? Where did it go? Maybe it's somewhere else? Somewhere else? Why would it be somewhere else? It's never somewhere else. It's always there. HATTIE: It's got to be here. LOLLY: Yeah? Where? HATTIE: My violin is worth over $80,000, it's all I have! -We've been robbed! -We've been robbed! They stole our instruments!

Oh, I think he's kind of attractive in a kind of mysterious eastern way, don't you? No. He's not my type. I rarely see my type in this neighborhood. -Look at him. -Oh, God. I like stars, you know, like Jack Nicholson is my type. Yes. And he could put his little shoes under my bed. Him or Wallace Beery. Stella.

About everything. About the accident. About her crystals. Oh, what accident? Well, you see, if two 2-B hadn't left their garbage in the middle of hallway, then Stella wouldn't have tripped on it and fallen down and broken both her legs. And then if Leonard hadn't driven his Kawasaki into the Wonderbed truck in Indianapolis, I wouldn't have been able to be here and take care of her and meet you and take up my painting again. See, how sometimes horrible things happen for a very good reason? You're one of a kind, Sweet Face. [GASPS] Oh. Oh, you picked diamonds. What a beauty! Gems.

They're great. -Thanks. -LOLLY: You're welcome. Here. I also got this for you two weeks ago, before Chicago. SAM: Wow. I hope you understandmy position. If my agents and publishers ever found out that I was involved with drug money, I mean--I mean, let's face it. Any bad publicity right now would get in the way of everything I'm trying to-- I mean, like, you know, ruin, like, my career, you know? [SCOFFS] A Gucci watch? Do you like it? SAM: You got me a Gucci watch? LOLLY: Yeah, well, I know it's a bit extravagant, Sam, but there were two ones I could have chosen from. One had a lizard strap and this one was stainless. And, you know, I didn't think you wanna wear a reptile on your arm, you know? And stainless is more casual and-- I wanna move in with you, Sam. Uh, here. I also got this for you. Um, it goes with the watch. I mean, you won't believe what it's been like here around here, Sam. Hattie is crazy. She's a maniac. I just can't live with her anymore. Who? LOLLY: My roommate. What do you mean you wanna move in with me? Well, you know, I know you have to move out of your sublet. SAM: I don't even have a place of my own right now. Well, I can move in with you at your sister's. You mean--you mean the two of us live at my sister's with my sister? I wasn't even planningon spending a lot of time there, uh, anyway. I mean, I thought I was gonna be-- I was gonna be here. I was gonna be there. I was gonna be here. I was gonna be there. I was gonna be mostly here. You're never here, Sam. You're never here when I need you. You missed my tonsil operation. SAM: That was the last game of the World Series. LOLLY: And every seder my aunt ever had. Don't dangle that seder stuff.

You were ordering dishes from that home shopping show on TV. Go, Sam.Why don't you just go right now? Why do I have to pretendyou're here when you never are? [SIGHS] I heard about a sublet. A sublet? SAM: Yeah. On Riverside with a view. I thought you were gonna get your own place? It's Marcie's cousin's place. Go. Go to Boston. Loll, come here. Get away from me. Wow. You're upset. Don't worry about your friend. You--you'll pay her back. She's not my friend. And neither are you. This yellow sponge is now the surface sponge, and I made this new blue spongethe dish sponge. I thought the orange sponge was the dish sponge. The orange sponge used to be the dish sponge but then I made it the surface sponge. Don't tell me you've been washing the dishes with the surface sponge. Since when did the orange spongebecome surface sponge? Two weeks ago it become the surface sponge. You mean to tell me you've been the dishes with the surface sponge for two weeks? So what's the dish sponge? This blue sponge is now the dish sponge. And I made this yellow sponge the surface sponge because you usedthe orange sponge on the floor. So what's the orange sponge? You're busted, baby. -Where is she? -She's not here yet. I was just checking to see if you can hear me. LOLLY:Evanston, what is in your pants? Pantyhose. I'll be at the men's room next door. -LOLLY: Diane. -Hi. Welcome back. Hey. What time did you came?
