Yes, I see how that would be an inconvenience. - Please don't start with me today. - "And see just then" "If you're still a friend" "Or am I just a girl To break and bend" Fascinating occupation. How can anyone do that for a living? Life insurance gone out and you need forms, you need to read the forms, - and you need a college degree - Mom. - to read these forms. Then you try... - Its time. and fill them out, and then you miss the expiration date... Tanya can't help me. She can't understand it any better than... - Well, they are just kids. - Yeah, well... Hey, Sandra, how was Disney World? Billy got sick, but you know, there's always next year. Absolutely. There's always next year. "Not only does he bend spoons, he can bend minds." "Don't miss this rare opportunity to meet celebrated author" "Ron Christopher, the author of Bending Spoons" "at the Moravian Book Shop in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania." I'm assuming you don't want to try another round of chemo therapy. Anyone who says there's nothing worse than death hasn't lived through chemo. I've already enrolled you in our Embrace Life class. Embrace Life? Do doctors try to be ironic or is it an occupational hazard? - So cute. See you later, alligator. - Thank you. Here you go, honey. Next class in three days. - "Dr. Winslow, line one, please." - "Oh, okay. Thank you! I got it." He doesn't even know I exist. All right, you win. Ill ask him out. Works for me. Embrace Life. I'll see you later, honey. Mom, I've made a decision. I'm not pretending anymore. Okay. Do you have any idea how much that cost? I do. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be... Why am I yelling at you? It's a stupid wig, and... It's cool. I mean, it's not like we can take it back. No. Once it has the cancer cooties, I don't think they can resell it. Hey, I dig that. Destiny. You know, honey. We can always go see another doctor. We can... Mom, it's all good. I'm gonna walk home. - You sure? - You start lunch, okay? Go straight home and don't talk to strangers. - Yes, ma'am. - Unless they're cute strangers. Be safe! I love you!

Okay, lets sign the papers. Oh. Very good. Thank you. Thank you so much. - What?! - Oh, I'm right here. What... I'm so... What are you doing? Oh, just looking around. Well you... I mean, this isn't a... We can't... Were in the middle of a... That's okay. Well come back another time. Lets go, baby. No, sir, please don't go. You know, my sisters so much better at making the arrangements. You could make an appoint... Maybe they had to feed the meter? Okay, you have to go. Come on. You gotta go. Come on. Go. Out. Out. Come on. Come on. This isn't a game or whatever you think it is. This is my business. I just... I don't have time for your pranks. Please? - Dude! - Jesus! No, but I'll give you two more guesses. - Did I not make myself clear? - Oh, yes. Very clear. Clearly lying. You said you were busy. You don't look busy at all. Yeah, I'd be more than happy to call the police. Oh, good. Go ahead, call them. "Hello? Police? Thank God." "I'm being held hostage in my beautiful funeral home" "by a bald sickly-looking teenage girl." I just wanna know what's gonna happen to me. That's all. First one that blinks, loses. I only need one page. I don't really know a lot of people. You get the entire book. Okay, cool. People can color. Is the sun rising or setting in this painting? It's whatever you want it to be. - Is that sky half empty or half full? - What are you talking about? Well, this artist clearly did not want to clarify. It is mysterious on purpose, I think. I don't want to talk about this painting anymore. Okay, you're the boss. So what's next? Casket selection? - Are you sure? - Is there a quality issue? Ever-sealed. How's the warranty? In case I want to bring it back? I will make an exception for you. You work alone and scare easily? I like solitude, and you didn't scare me, you startled me. That's a big difference. Okay, just stay here. Don't touch anything. "Hello? Jankowski?" "Tomorrow at 7:00. Okay, thank you." Okay, where are you? See, I don't find this kind of thing funny. - Where... Where are you? - Does this coffin make me look fat? It is not a coffin. It is a casket. Get out of it! Don't worry. I took my shoes off before I'd gotten in it. - What's next? - What do you mean? Where's the laboratory, Dr. Frankenstein? Seriously, where is it? Are you okay? Blood and guts don't bother me. You should see my treatments. I don't know how to respond to that. - Lots of vomiting. - Of course. - And pooping. - I get it. I will be naked. You'll see me. Kinda creepy. I know a female mortician. Would you like that better? I think so. - All right. I'll get her when it's... - My turn. Yeah. "Faster than you think I am" That thing is still hot. "Try and catch me if you can" Come on, come on, come on! - "Memories are in the past" - Breathers... I don't scare you, I startle you. member? Do you really know a female mortician? I mean, you could just be saying that and I would never know. Oh, this is gonna be a big deal, isn't it? - Can I ride in the hearse? - Wait your turn. Something you don't want me to see? Okay, look. I'm not a person who's good with jokes, so if this is a joke, I'm just not gonna be good with that. "Stepping outside of herself" "Dance between heaven and hell" "Cause she don't believe" "That the sun, that it shines on everyone" Hey. Yeah, what's up? You're having lunch with who? Yeah. You're right. A late eating might be better. No, that's fine, honey. You have fun, okay? Yeah, bye. "Hungry hippo hunting trees" "Colorado hiking dreams" "Tell them all she's searching for peace" So you're seriously a mortician? Believe me, no one would lie and say they are. But there are times when we all lie and say we are not. You're not like Bill. No, I deal with the breathers, Bill deals with the sleepers. The dead ones? There are two kinds of morticians. Huggers and others. Huggers are all about empathy, holding sad people close and making them feel better, and others, well... they would rather be anyplace other than with the deceased's family. Doesn't wanna love them today and bury them tomorrow. Lets just say Bills had his challenges. Mom? Mom? I need another quarter. - You need another quarter, what? - I need another quarter now. I think she means, please. I need another quarter, please, now. Honey, go help Uncle Bill with the hot dogs. - No! - Why not? He scares me. He kinda scares me, too. I think I might have a quarter. Maybe you can get him something from that machine and he'll smile more. - That's a cute kid. - He's always into something. Between him, his sister and her father, I barely have time to breathe, which means more work for my brother, I'm sorry to say. So when this thing gets the best of me, you'll hook me up? I'll take care of you, of course. Woo-hoo! I get to be a corpse! Yes, that's right. Passed the interview, got the J-O-B. - Quiet, quiet, please... - "I'm gonna be a corpse" - "Bill Jakowski. Woo-hoo!" - Can we have a little decorum? She is delightful. Yeah, she's a barrel of laughs. Every one of them inappropriate. 200 restaurants in Lehigh Valley, she needed to have chili cheese dog. - Food of the Gods. - Would you do me a favor? I don't like people in my personal space. Would you move over, please? It's a community space, Bill. Restaurants are like that. So when I get to the other side, do you want me to contact you? How about we not get ahead of ourselves? How about we start with the other side of the table, see how that that goes. Well, don't you want to know what it's like? I mean, - if there really is a heaven? - You can visit me anytime. I'm not talking no horror movie. I just mean something so specific, you'd have to know it's me. Sounds wonderful. - Here, Uncle Bill. - What's that? I don't... I don't want that. It didn't work. The pills are not gonna cut it anymore. Hey, Mom? Have you ever seen a pink hearse? Who's going to take care of you? The Power of Now. It doesn't sound very churchly. I think somebody left that here. Mark suggested we talk. Never trust a psychiatrist who uses his first name. It's a breakdown in protocol. He's trying to gain your trust. The Secret? Okay, well lets get started. Interesting library. Are you a New-Ager? No, no, no. Far from it. No. - What religion are you? - I'm an Episcopalian minister. And they had you read The Power of Now in Episcopal minister school, did they? It's seminary. But no. No, they did not. No, no, no. It... Okay then. Well, lets get started. My first question is, have you ever seen a miracle? Well actually, I ask the questions. As the hospital chaplain, it's my job to acquaint myself with each of my patients needs. Well, lookey here. This is kind of a miracle. You have an actual, honest to God Bible in your hippie New Age Episcopalian office. Have you ever seen a real miracle? Grace, this is not how it's done. No, no. I've never seen a miracle, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. - I like you. - You do? You're honest. But more on the subject, do you ministers get a pension? You must have 401-K, right? We weren't on that subject at all. Well, I was just asking for my mother. She was curious. There you go. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. Good. - Okay, what...? - Lisa. Lisa. - There you go. - Thanks. Ta-da! It's nice to see that somebody actually read the book. Chapter five, tricks for gullible friends. - You are? - Grace. I do believe that you're here for more than an autograph. I wanna know what's gonna happen to me. Well, that's not up to me. I'm gonna take a walk. Who's a good doggie? Yeah, dogs can sense things that humans can't. Storms, earthquakes. Ghosts? I've read all your books. Then you understand you need faith to bend the spoons. That's where I'm having trouble... faith. Most people believe in something. I want to believe because I believe, not because I'm afraid of dying. Teach me. - To bend the spoons or to believe? - Either. You have a business card? I don't think you can read minds. If you can, it's not in the book. Here. Page 12, paragraph three. "Making people whole makes me whole." "That's why I teach people to bend spoons." I wrote that? Okay, now she's showing them some sort of magic trick. She's only been in class for a couple of days and she's already taking over. It should come as no surprise to you, Mark. She's a funny kid. I mean, it's extraordinary to see how her mind works. She's dealing with this better than most people at her advance stage. She's definitely not getting any better. I'm embarrassed to admit, I pray harder for her than any of them. My Lord, that's a terrible thing to say. - I'm too tired. - Liar. Give her some time. You're the one on borrowed time. - Hey! - Stop it! You know, some of us will be wearing Survivor t-shirts. Not you. You're on the first gurney out of here. Lets talk about something different. - Like what color your coffin will be? - I hate black. Well, Bill can get any color casket. Oh, right. Your mortician friend. Another lie. I don't tell lies. Your whole life is a lie, just like all of ours. Pretty good. Holy shit! I believe I peed my pants. Because they think I'm a liar. I don't care what they think. This is a business. I can't have kids - in here causing chaos. - My pants are wet, too. I don't think you're allowed to use the S word. Well, I think you're a little too old to be peeing in your own pants. Oh, and by the way, Doug locked Audrey in a coffin. Well, that's Audrey's problem. See? This is what I mean. I can't... Wait a minute. Hey! Hey! - What have you done? - Dude, I didn't know it locked. - Ever-sealed. - I gotta find the key. Find the key? No one has ever wanted out before. Bill, don't panic. I know you won't let me down. Audrey? Audrey? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Just head this way. Mary, come on! Come on! There's a little girl downstairs locked in a casket. Go find the key. Find the key. Find the key. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry for your loss. Excuse me. I can't find the key. I can't find the key. I can't find the key, Mary. I found it. - How could you misplace it? - You got clients reconsider? - How long has it been? - Should I call the fire department? No, no, there's not enough time for that. Just please turn faster. You know, she's probably out of oxygen by now. Can you keep your opinions to yourself, please? Got it. Oh, thank you. Okay, then. I gotta get back to Mr. Bergey. We don't have to tell anyone about this, do we? I mean... Take these kids to my office, keep them out of sight, - and keep an eye on them. - You got it. Come on, rats. Well, are you okay? Maybe we should straighten this place up. Shut up and sit quietly or I won't drive you back to the hospital. In the dark, anything can be real. We need the light to remind us that it's all okay. You think about the dark a lot, huh? I've got a lot of dark in my future. I know that. Indians buried people with food. I vomit whenever I eat. You want me to puke for all of eternity? Warriors got weapons, women got beads, and Bill will get you a light. You would do that for me? Well... a light. Yeah, a light. I guess I could figure that out. Spit to spit? Tit to tit. This was my best suit. Could I just say I'll try my best? Pat her head. Wow! Oh, come on in, boys. Don't be afraid. There's nothing to be afraid of. Gunther loved children. - Gunther? - An old name for an old man. We were married 62 years. I'm Vivian. These are some of Gunther's favorite people. - Come on. This is my friend Jack... - Hello. - And my cousin, Miley. - Hello. - And here's David. - Hi, how are you? And Gunther's sister, Maud. Hi. Ooh, such beautiful faces. - I have to draw them sometime. - She's a fabulous artist. - And this is my brother, Arthur. - How you doing, guys? - Vincent. - Vincent. - That's Bobby. - Hey, Bobby. And this is... my Gunther. I never did like this suit. For cripes sake, Viv. Let the man rest in peace. You boys wanna know what's really lousy when you get to be old like me? You look better dead than you do alive. I bet you boys like cookies. Peanut butter. I made them for his trip, but I think he'd miss a few. Damn it. She was passing store bought off on us, and saving the homemade for the dead guy! I think like a small, adjustable dome light there would be pretty good for reading. A DVD player would be nice, but no scary movies. Okay, a dome light and a DVD player. - I'll see what I can do. - Bill? Yes? - What are you doing? - Were customizing my casket. No. No. Get out of there. You're a survivor, and survivors don't need caskets! Go to the car. I have no doubt that you had something to do with this. I don't know what your deal is or why you're such a freak, but stay away from my daughter. You'll hear from my attorney. You, too. What are you doing? You can't stand there like that. We've got a viewing going on. It's not dignified. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, Mrs. Bergey, Mrs. Bergey, I'm so sorry. These children are not here with our permission. I'm mortified. Are you kidding? This is a perfect wake for Gunther. He loved children so much. I'm sorry, what do you mean? He taught art at the middle school for 50-plus years. What a lovely gesture to have these children join us. - May I draw something? - Of course. I think I'll draw a lovely sunrise. Do you wanna help me, Bill? Let me tell you two something. This is how all of these should be. Were gonna tell all our friends about this place. And our friends are older than dirt, and they all got a lot of money. You'll be rich. Okay, then. I gotta go empty my colostomy bag before it pops. Oh... Really. I'm gonna go draw something, too. Audrey, angel, is that you? I'm just getting a drink of water. Oh! I'm sorry, my good man. Jankowski Funeral Home, please? Oh, here we are. Wonderful. Keep the change! I gotta get another job. Hello! I think this guy needs a new job. Aw, there you are. Thanks for not going into the light. Whoa, slow down there, tiger. You've been out for a while. Audrey called me and I rushed right over. You gave me a stroke. I think you took years off my life. Anyway. Why does the back of my head hurt so much? Getting you here did entail a lot of dragging. Down the steps. When I close my music box, the music stops. Is this about this light thing again? My flashlight will project a beam of light for 54 minutes. Just forget about what the manufacturer claims. They lie. We should get her an eternal flame. Kennedy had one. Kennedy was a President of the United States. I was a Girl Scout, for a month. Until my mother ruined it, just like everything else. Anyway, you can invent the first nuclear casket. Here are the blueprints for my casket. I don't want... I don't want to see blueprints to any casket. I think the utility company will outlast any battery. A couple of 210 outlets should do it. - Now that's where you come in. - No, I'm not doing that. A promise is a promise is a promise. Hey, Billy boy, this may be a bad time to ask, but do you think you're more of a surf or a turf? Okay. Everything's ready. I should have enough for all of your new friends. I think I'm gonna skip my blood test tomorrow. Really? You mean you would seriously consider not prolonging your life? because of what I'm wearing to dinner? I'd say if the shoe fit's... But oh, look. You neglected to wear those, too. - Just as you forgot to wear a bra. - Geez. This is not a strip club, missy. Okay, I'll go change. You... get the door. Mine's bigger. Hey, Ron Christopher. - And you are? - Oh, I'm Bill Jankowski. I'm not family or... Grace invited me. - Are you family? - No. Grace invited me, too. Interesting. And we give thanks for this opportunity to share not only our new friendships, - but our faith. - Amen. So the hospital assigned you to Grace or...? Well, it's more of a pleasure than an assignment. - And what is it that you do? - He writes books about Recorded Voice Phenomenon and a hole to Hell. - A hole to Hell? - Well, that didn't take long. - More wine anyone? - Yeah. The Russians wanted to see how deep they could drill a hole, but when they lowered a recording device, they... - Recorded voices of anguish - No. and despair tormented for all eternity in a burning lake of fire. Isn't that just the way? I mean, they should be finding oil, what do they find? Hell. How's the pasta? I soaked my boob. Or maybe I didn't. Do you really believe this nonsense? Well, I have seen the hole. God have mercy. So, I went with the Alfredo because I prefer white wine to red. He also records ghosts. I mean, cheap white wine is definitely better than cheap red wine. Or maybe it isn't. So now, you communicate with the dead? The dead can create a stronger energy field than the living in some cases. You know, that's the most absurd thing I've ever heard. I mean, how do you top finding Hell? He can also bend spoons with his mind. Wait a minute. Here's the thing. I spend a lot of time with dead people. Well, that's comforting. Practitioner of the occult. Oh, no. Reverend, I'm gonna have to take offense to that. Were an organization that offers services for any and all faiths. I meant him. Cheers. We don't even know what one third of the brain does. - It's a trick, though. It's not faith. - What are you talking about? You can only do it if you believe you can do it. Excuse me. I need each healthy male to draw a straw. One lucky bachelor gets to sleep with me tonight. You people are pagan. Oh, well, my mother will chaperone. It'll be a threesome. I know how hard this must be. I'm sorry. That's the stupidest thing I've ever said. I couldn't possibly know how hard this is. I'm sorry. - Once... - What? Nothing. Nothing. I don't know what I'm talking about. There's something I have to do. Don't let me fall. Don't let me fall. - Don't, don't, don't. - Oh, oh. No. Whoa. I'm not a strong person. I'm not good with people. I never know the right thing to say. You're a funeral home director. I'm sure you always know the perfect thing to say. You sure do drink a lot. Or maybe you don't. So I had always heard girls talking about jumping into bed with mom and dad and having pillow fights, and I never really understood what that was all about, so... The Pope said fathers are so necessary as examples, and guides for our children, wisdom and virtue. What, isn't the Pope the other guy's boss? - Wisdom is wisdom. - Got it. So I originally got this for my father in case he ever showed up, and he might while there's still time. He might. He might want to get to know me while there's still time. Of course he would. "Grace has always had a strange way of doing things." When she was younger, I'd go to parent-teacher conferences... Well, when I remembered. One teacher would say, "Oh, she's always telling jokes." "She's always saying inappropriate things. She's so hard to teach." And then I'd go across the hall, and another teacher would say, "She's always telling jokes. She's always saying inappropriate things." "Such a pleasure to teach." Well, that doesn't make any sense. I think some people get Grace, and others never will. Oh, gee, Bill! You get to sleep with me tonight! "Lets do it. Lets do it. Lets do it. Lets do it. I wanna do it." Do you wanna do a family bed time, Bill? Would you stop it?! Why me? Well, you drew the short straw. She's never smelt her fathers cologne. Listen to me. You spray that on me one more time, I'm gonna punch you.. I care if you're a man of the cloth, I will sock you right in the nose. Now I did not sign up for this, you understand? All I said is I would come to dinner. - Short straw. - Oh, God! The Reverend and I thought you should wear something a little bit more discreet. - You've been drinking. - Not nearly enough. Well, that was a set-up from the get-go. Of course it was. You approve of her charade? I approve of unconditional love. I will not partake of the dark side. Hey, I've never met an atheist who can bend spoons. You have faith. You're halfway there. How long does it take? If it takes a lifetime, it'll be worth it. - It looks like something nuns wear. - I'm hot. - Bill thinks so. - Oh, I'm all sweaty. Wait, he does? This is why people get divorced. This is crazy. Where you going, welcher? I'm not gonna fall for your tricks. It's just normalcy, Bill. Don't be afraid of being normal. Well look who's talking. And don't start with that. I'm not gonna fall for that. I'm too smart to fall for that. Okay, Mister Jankowski. Tell us a story. Once upon a time, there was a stupid man who never learned how to stick up for himself. That's a boring autobiography. - Oh, shit! - Hey! No potty talk in front of my sainted child. Oh! You're both nuts. Bill, have you ever heard of the boogieman? "You wanna know why we cry" "Bring it home" "You want to know why we dream" "It's cause we see" "It's cause we see" "Second wind, coming back again" "Gonna save my soul from the preacher man" "Taking that lonely road around the bend" "To a different time with better men" "You wanna know why we cry" "Why do you lie?" "Why do you lie?" "Second wind Coming back again" Get away from me. Grace, come on. My legs are asleep. Come on. Can you move your leg? Just move your legs. Grace, come on. Get up. Grace, come on. Grace? Venus! Venus! - Grace? - Gotcha! I don't know what is wrong with you, but it is no little thing Okay, honey. Stop torturing him. Are you guys hungry? I want an answer on the new X-ray equipment by the end of the month, no later. Find out if the bids are in on the tile for the south corridor. - You hearing me? - Yes. You're a secretary, not a shadow. Let me hear that you hear. - I heard, yes. - Heard what? X-ray machine end of month, bids on tiles. Good. And check with food services. I was sitting down at lunch ready to enjoy a hot bowl of clam chowder and there wasn't a damn spoon in sight. She's got such concentration and commitment. Frankly, it's a joy to watch. But if it's misguided, is it helping? It's not helping my silverware budget, I can tell you that. That's more your thing than it is my thing. It's true, you know, physically, they're not getting any better, but I don't think it's a good enough reason to dissuade them. I'm not comfortable with it here, I want to be clear on that. This is a hospital, not some holistic health center. Look, in college, I went to the islands on spring break. There was some man down there winning all the locals money by rolling dice. Now, the dice were loaded, so he was cheating. That's the best thing he could come up with on spring break, gambling. Any hoo, this woman comes up and she's got a doll, a voodoo doll dressed like the dice guy, and she pulls out this knife and she stabs it, and the guy falls down dead. The guy was a jerk and he knew he was a jerk, so he died because he believed he should die. So maybe some people live because they believe they should live. I think mine bent a little. Yeah, I think... I can kinda see that a little. Hey, look! - Holy... - Crap. You ride in the chair, you die in the chair. - I am in charge today. - You're the charge nurse? And you, you call that being in charge? Do you have a question I can answer? I do. I do. "She's been in the Embrace Life class... What a jerk!" "I'm sorry, they are actually professionals..." No. I am gonna call my attorney. - Audrey! - Hey, little girl! Wanna see a magic trick? - This guy's a horrible... - The children seem to like him. - Disappear. - Come on... I think you should tell that to Dr. Adams. What? This is why I don't like clowns. Nice wheels. Can I borrow them on prom night? I'm not strong like you. From now on, it's all about waiting. What'd they say? Make my peace. I won't be needing this. So... do it for the both of us. Bend the damn spoon and... beat the beast. "Audrey?! Audrey, angel! Are you in there?" "Honey, the doors locked and Mommy can't get in!" "Listen, I want this door open this instant!" "I want it open right now!" The only thing I'm scared of other than her... is that horrible darkness. So just remember to tell Bill. Please. Of course it's you! What did I tell you? I told you stay away from my girl! You put these ridiculous ideas in her head, and now she believes them. I don't want you to ever see Audrey again. Ever. And if you do, I'm gonna call the police. Audrey. Just tell Bill. Please, tell him. - Come on, Audrey. Audrey. - Tell him. Please, Grace, please. There's my mom. Later. -Bye. -Bye. Hey, hon! Talk about the proverbial nail in a coffin. Excellent metaphor. I... I know how much all this stuff means to you, Gracie. Only my father calls me Gracie. You never met your father. Still, it's something I'd like to reserve just for him. Why don't you call me something else? Beautiful remains unclaimed. So what now? Were going to do this. Were all gonna do it. Well make it happen. Well, if anyone can, it's you. Thank you. Hey, beautiful, you want a ride? - No! - They booted them out of the hospital a few weeks ago, we have all this extra room. You know, it could be illegal. Did that ever occur to you? That is just patently absurd. Why are you being so stubborn about this? - You know you like the kid. - See you later. Bill Jankowski, come back here! There he is! Hey, look, it's Billy boy. Couldn't wait to tell us all the big news. Oh, for the love of... Shoot! Dang it! Great shot, Kobe! - You took her cruising in that? - Well, I couldn't just take her! You shoulda seen them at the drive-thru! Ball! Don't you have people to do that for you? You know, I don't know a lot about the lifestyles of the rich and famous, but I would think not actually working for a living would make a man soft and weak. Oh, what I do isn't work? Well, what is it that you do do, exactly? I mean, what are you? You're a writer? So you don't even have to pick up a pen anymore. It's just click, click, click, and you're a writer, right? - That's work? - Yeah, right, but what you do is? Dressing up dead people? Nothing too creepy about that. And I'm sure it's extremely labor intensive. Like playing with Barbie. What do you want, exactly? Exactly? I want to know what Venus wore when you slept with her. Now hold on a second. Why are you asking me that? Because I suppose that I'm the dessert after tonight's dinner. What? What did you... What did you say? Guess you never went back for seconds. Yeah, no matter. Whatever it is, it's gonna be cool, right? I mean, hell... How long is she gonna be wearing it for, anyway, really? Honestly. Right? I almost had it. - Yes? - Okay, you. I did it. - How'd it go? - Not pretty. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. We're only talking a finite amount of time, here. Hold on. It's him. - Hello? - Oh, hey. I need to see you. Love to make that happen, Billy boy, - but I'm very busy. - I'll bring some chili-cheese dogs. - My schedule just opened up. - Falls, 20 minutes. - Later. - "You are so sexy." Although I appreciate the compliment... Oh, hey, man. That wasn't intended for you, okay? - I didn't realize... - Who you with? - No one. I'm alone. - Okay, then. - How'd we do? - Hook, line and sinker. I hope you're happy. I'm not convinced they won't actually ask me to stay the next time I find Hell. Get over yourself. Hey, are you with that sexy blonde from the bookstore? I can tell by the awkward pause that you are. Tell her I think she has great taste. Ciao, baby. How can you eat that? I'm not really concerned about my cholesterol, you know what I'm saying? What's up? What's going on between Ron and your mother? - What do you mean? - Is he sleeping over tonight? The idea was floated. You have... concerns? Yeah. I do. I definitely have concerns. What do we know about this guy? Other than those 250 pages of highly detailed information listed on Google, he's a mysterious conundrum. All right, lets just talk about what we do know. We know that he's a bimbo chaser, and your mother deserves better than that. Your mom's no bimbo. Well, I'm just happy somebody finds her attractive. Of course he finds her attractive. What's the matter with you? Well, how am I supposed to know what's attractive about her? - She's my mother! - Everything! Everything is perfect. Everything? Like what? No. I'm not gonna sit here, and I'm not gonna engage you in a conversation about why other men find your mother attractive. - I'm not gonna do it. - Well, I don't have a father. I only have you. Come on, Billy boy. Just between us? Should I ask Ron? The very first thing any man would notice that's attractive about your mother is her neck. Why are you laughing? Her neck is beautiful. - No, it's... she got her... - Her neck? No kidding. Yes, it's beautiful. Don't laugh about it. I'm telling you. What else? Her legs are great. Beautiful. They go on forever. - They do? - Yeah, they do. No wonder she takes such good care of them, then. They're creamy soft things. They feel like velvet. I'll bet they do. Good thing you didn't mention her boobs. Mom thinks it's kinda weird the way they point straight up. Yeah. I imagine my being here is quite a surprise to you. A shock that is hard to put into words. Hard to put into words? Some writer. Hello... Oh! My goodness. What have we here? Oh, nothing. A couple flowers. You're pretty. You should have pretty things. Ron got you some too, I think. You know what? I'll put them in water. He tried his best. They're lovely, Ron. Come on in. Look what Doug brought. Aw. Look at that handsome smile disappear. - They're for Grace. - Oh! Oh. Why don't you and Doug take these into the kitchen, and put them in a vase... or three. Well, why doesn't Ron help Doug with that? Because Ron is getting me a glass of wine. - Your wish is my command. - Thank you. And that is why you do not buy discounted flowers. They weren't discount. A funeral director knows discounted flowers, believe me. Anyway, Bill, I understand you were Grace's knight in shining armor, saved her from the ravages of hospital red tape. She made me a very compelling argument. I told him he couldn't court my mother until he let me have my spoon-bending classes at his funeral home. Wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's courting me? Momma, pay attention. Ron is. And Bill now seems to have thrown his hat into the ring. - What's courting? - Prelude to dating. Oh, before dating, there's courting. There was courting. Only in this wacky household does courting still exist. Everywhere else in the world, everybody just dates. Okay, then. Well, as of tonight, I am officially courting Grace. - Really? - I accept. Good. Lets drink a toast. Okay... Which one of my courters is gonna get me some more wine? - I think we're out of wine. - Oh! I have another bottle in the car. - All right. - Oh, yes! Thank you, Ron. So, how long does this courting shit take? Courting stuff? Okay, good. I'm glad that you asked. Normally it takes a couple months. What? - How old are you? - 17. You seem different than you do when I met you. So do you, man. Are you as sick as she is? She's sicker. For now, anyway. You can't hurt her, you know? I mean, she's been through so much. - You too, I'm sure. - Yeah. Okay, then. You should go as fast as your heart takes you. - Okay! - And it... Well, hold on. And then, and then you should, you know, slow down so that you don't do something that you shouldn't do, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, big guy. Oh, hey, I'm not interrupting here, am I? No. Bill was just giving me some girl advice. He was? Great. Who knows more about girls than the undertaker here? Oh, yeah. So speaking of that, I'm gonna run. I'm gonna take off. You gotta go? He's gotta go. Oh, he's gotta go. Oh, that's too bad. Hey, girls! Ron has to go! Girls, did you hear what I said? Ron has to go! - Yeah. - Me, too. Early chapel tomorrow. You might have a better chance of turning her on without the apron. - Thank you. - Moms not feeling too well. She says bye. I should probably hit it, too, and I'll call you in the morning. - Take it easy. - Bye. - See you. - Night. - Goodbye. - Thanks for coming, you guys. Well see you later. Hey, where's your mom? Oh, last I saw, she was driving the porcelain bus, upstairs - Can I get the family bed ready? - Yeah, honey. You do that. Venus? Venus? Hey... Venus? You decent? "Sometimes I think I can write the song to make you stay" Venus. Get up. Get up. Get up. - Get up, please. Get off the floor. - What are you doing? You know, Grace had a nice night planned for you and me and her, I think. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? I'm just having fun. You should try it sometime. It's pretty great. I don't want to have fun. Come on, wake up. - What? I can take care of myself. - Wake up. Wake up. Get off me! Geez, you fun-killer. I can take care of myself. God. Oh my god. I can see the tile marks on my face. Oh my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Oh. Bill? Bill? Bill? Hey! Bill! I can totally see the fricken' tile marks on my face. Hey, dork. I just made that bed. Where you going? Grace, I just realized I'm not your guy. I tried. But I just don't have it in me. Bill, what are you talking about? I thought I could. I thought I should. But I'm not strong. Not like you. That's what you need. Ron's your guy. I'm truly sorry. "I'd cut the ties that tame you" "When you can't love" "You are in all the good I am" "So when you think there is no good left" "I will hold you so you feel it" "You are my heartbeat in the dark" "The lump in my throat" "You are my darkest moment" "A spark of hope" "You are in all the good I am" "So when you think there is no good left" "I will hold you so you feel it" - Do you want to talk about it? - Not really. I wanna talk about it. I'm listening. I can't talk about it. I can't talk... I can't... "Sometimes I think I can write the song to make you stay" "As if the notes linger on and on so will you" Bill Jakowski! Come out here, you coward! I wanna talk to you! I know you're home! I can see your car! What are you afraid of, Bill?! Me?! Well, you'll be glad to know that this little inconvenience will soon pass. And then you can go back to your life and you'll never have to think of me again. And you won't, and she can't... and that'll be that. No one will remember I was even here, no one. Grace. I know that I am not the easiest person to get along with. but what you couldn't know is that it hasn't always been like this for me. There was a time 30 years ago... when anything was possible. I had no intention of becoming a funeral director, in fact. It was the very last thing on my mind. "When I was young it seemed that life was so wonderful" "A miracle. Oh it was beautiful, magical" "And all the birds in the trees..." "All I wanted to do was live." "I didn't want anything to do with the world of death." "Oh, playfully watching me" "Anyway, I figured my little sister would eventually" "take over the family business because she was the smart one." "Logical, Oh responsible, practical" "And then they showed me a world" "Where I could be so dependable Oh, clinical" "It was that summer that my life changed forever." "I only had one thing on my mind back then..." "and it drove my old man crazy that it had nothing to do with" "embalming bodies or washing hearses." "No. The only thing I thought about or cared about" "was my girlfriend, Bethany Miles." "She was so beautiful." "She was an artist, and to her the world was one big, beautiful place" "and she just wanted to paint every inch of it." "When you're in love with a beautiful woman " "Our life together was so great." "She was gonna go to France and study," "and I was just gonna tag along, you know?" "Have an adventure, see where life took us." "Anything was possible." "Everybody wants her" "Everybody loves her" "Everybody wants to take your baby home" "Grace, everybody loved her." "They loved her talent, they loved her smile." When you're in love with a beautiful woman" "I know I loved her." "She was perfect." "And even though I wasn't gonna become a funeral director" "I would still help my parents out whenever they needed me." "And that summer while they were on vacation, we got a coroner call." "My dad had a contract with the city." "If an ambulance was too late, they'd call us." "And Bethany told me that she once saw some poor old guy" "drop dead from the heat at one of these art shows." "It was a hot summer back then," "so I figured this was something like that." "But when I got there..." "I could see the way that people were acting," "and I realized this wasn't like that at all." "Everything was strange." "There was a woman laughing, just laughing for no reason." "And all the other people were different, all..." "I don't know how to say it other than they were..." "They were acting like ghosts." "The person I was," "the person I could have been," "died with Bethany that day." "All the dreams," "all of the adventures were gone forever." "And the woman who ran her down" "who killed her," "who killed us," "was so drunk that she didn't even know she was a murderer" "until they woke her up the next morning and told her." "The sadness was overwhelming." "It was debilitating." Eventually, I didn't feel that pain anymore. But I didn't feel anything else, either. When I was 20, I would've gladly traded places with you so I wouldn't have had to feel that pain ever again. And then one day you came into my life. And I thought, maybe it's time for another adventure. And then a couple weeks back, there was your mom, laughing, drunkenly laughing over nothing, and she didn't, understand that she had the power to kill me once more. It will be good again, I promise. And then what? What do I do when you're gone? I need you to help me. Grace, I need to know whether that sun is rising or setting. I'll never be able to figure it out without you. I wish you'd call me Gracie. "It's me" "It's always been my fault I keep trying" "But it always falls apart I am stuck" "I just keep fighting with myself" "Falling on, on and on" "I push away" "Anyone who might care Can't seem to look" "No I can't find it anywhere" "So I pray to God I'll see the light" "And He knows that I'll change I wanna love" "I wanna be happy And free to make mistakes" "I want my better life My happy ever after" "I want to survive" "A miracle in itself I'm finding myself" "I'm changing who I am" "This is a promise that I will always keep" "for my better life" I'm just, I'm so sorry. I didn't know how to tell you, or when. and I couldn't do it with everyone around. Are you mad? You are retarded. Hey, I don't think we're allowed to say that. No, Douglas. It is no longer acceptable to call mentally handicapped people retarded, but you are not mentally handicapped. You are retarded. What's the matter with you? And how could you getting better possibly make me mad? Well anyway, Dr. Winslow said it'll be months before he's sure. - Are you listening to me? - What? I need to make sure that one of us might escape and bend that damn spoon. Well, he said there was no guarantees, so... Baby, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, and you know what? It's the dying that really is easy. Bull. No, listen, you don't choose to die. It just happens when it happens. but living right takes fighting and commitment and honor, and all those things that are so damn hard for so many humans. But not for you. - I don't know. - I know. You're strong, and you're gonna live. You hear me? You're gonna do it. And every girlfriend and every wife and every lover better be so sick and tired of hearing about Grace this an Grace that. They're just gonna have to kiss you all the time to make you shut up. Is that how it works? Carry on, lovebirds. I see nothing. Mother, we must talk later, because your daughters been kissed by a... boy. Audrey? - It's perfect. - Thank you. - Maud helped me paint it. - It's a work of art. Shed be so happy. Really. The problem is this is all I can do. I mean, we're not doing her funeral, obviously. Getting Audrey in this would be impossible. Not impossible. Certainly not easy, but not impossible. - Were gonna do this. - For Audrey. - Hey, Dick! - Hello, Mary. - Thanks for taking the time. - No problem. You said it was important. As long as I'm free in a half an hour. I have the Bernards coming in - to see their little girl. - I understand. Too young. - May we talk in your office? - Yes. Please. - Oh. He's in. - Thank God. Are you sure you wouldn't find these catalogs online? No, I checked. The package is so old, my father sold it to them. All these files in my office only date back 10 years. "After that, well have to go to the basement." - Mom. - Huh? Of course they're early. Oh, come on, Bill. Okay, perhaps we can check this later. Oh, hey, you've been a godsend for even checking in the first place. - Yeah. I'll show you out. - No, I'll be fine. I'll just wait here and leave discreetly when the family comes in. - Okay. - Okay. I think we should get closer in case he needs our help. Mom? Honey? What's the matter? Are you okay? Mom, listen to me. - Okay, I'm listening. - He's always going to need your help. Yeah. Do you understand? Always. No backsliding. - Not ever. - Deal. Okay. Lets shag ass. There's certainly no hurry. We can wait here all day till you're both ready. My side of the family is very long-lived, healthy people. This horror must have come from Brain's side of the family. He had a cousin Anthony that died very young. For Christ sake, Helen. He got hit by a bus. Okay, Helen, we have to do this. - What have you done? - I don't... I want an explanation, and I want it this second. Then I'm the one who should give it to you. This is egregious. What did you do? I'm gonna destroy you. You can kiss your business goodbye. How dare you interfere with what I wanted! What about what Audrey wanted? Oh, of course you're involved in this. I should have known. Out. Come on, lets go. - She just wanted... - Your father would be spinning in his grave right now. Lights, lights, lights! No, you don't know what it feels like... - I don't want to deal with her anymore. - Helen. - I don't understand - Helen. Helen. God, look at her. Our angel. I'm sorry. This is so perfect. Please forgive me. - Hey, honey. - Did they like it? They loved it. I'm so glad we did it. - Was she beautiful? - So, so beautiful. Looked like an angel, her mom said. Come on. We should go home. I think we should go to the hospital first. - Yeah, okay. Come on. Lets go. - Come on. I'm waiting for the right time. If you're proposing, I don't think we have time to plan for a big church wedding. Stop joking. Be serious. I'm trying to be serious. Okay, I'll be serious. Go. How am I doing? I don't think... I don't think you should actually get outta here without being someone's legitimate girlfriend. Here. You know what this means? You can't kiss another girl for as long as you live. Hold on. This is a very nice ring. How about you can't kiss another girl for as long as I live? Retard. - Hey, Roma. Hey. - Hey. Grace wanted you to have a little treat. Oh, thank you so much. Thank Grace. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Sorry. I'm sorry, I should've been quieter. I'm sorry. That's all right. I'll have plenty of time to sleep. - Are you hungry? - Yes, please. - Here's your spoon, honey. - You gotta know that you are one of their favorite customers. I don't know anybody, other than the funeral director who would get up in the middle of the night to help somebody. - Yum. - A very tiny piece of this, please. - You do it. You cut it. You cut it. - Okay. - I'll get her some water. - All right. Aren't you so excited? Put a little chili on there, huh? Thanks. - How is it? - Perfection. - I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? It's full circle. You have to feed me... and change my diapers all over again. Stop. Stop. You stop talking for once in your life and listen to your mother. You are the reason that I was put on this earth, and I know that I am the reason that you were put on this earth because without you, honey, I wouldn't be here. We are in it together. Forever. It's a deal. Lets take a quick look in there. Open up. - Okay. - Why is my tongue black? Too many chili dogs. No. It's the toxins. They're jumping ship. Those cowards. So beach, not church? Well, you know, we just thought we could both use the fresh air. I do love weddings. I wish I could be there. We do, too, sweetie. Hey, I can make this easier for you. Please let me make it easier for you. Thank you, really... for everything. But you only die once... so I'd like to be there when it happens. Okay. But you have to promise to name your first-born Grace. Of course. Even if it's a boy. He's 8. It's not bad at all. They told me about 2 weeks ago. Coming to the church today. - We need a schedule. - Maybe later. They love drawing her pictures. It's time. Dylan drew you another picture. Thank you. It's beautiful. Here we are. No one should be surprised to be here. So can we please not make a big mishegoss out of it? May I pray? - If you must. - I most certainly must. Pray away. God in heaven, when you are done with her there, please send Grace back to us here. We will all be lost without her. Amen. Reincarnation, huh? I think someone might need a talk from the bishop. Maybe so. Ronald, despite your best efforts, I could not for the life or death of me bend this thing. Gracie. You are such a dork. Mom, I got like five hours to live, and your boyfriends calling me a dork. What's harder to bend than metal? Is...Is this why no one wants to die? Cause there's a stupid pop quiz at the end? Honey. Look around you. Look. You changed all of us. I mean, surely, that's harder than bending a spoon. - I love you so much. - We love you, honey. - We love you, Grace. - We love you. "Someday, I promise" "It'll all be different" "I'll work to make the difference In my life" "I'll change for the better" "I'll change my heart so that one day" "I'll be okay" "So that one day" "I'll be okay." William? Are you okay, Gracie? You were right. I am a dork. Oh, don't say that. I just realized... Faith isn't about holding on to what you believe. It's letting go of it. I think you're right. You got this? I promise. I think I'm gonna go. - Okay. - Okay? Whatever you want. - It's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. Bill. The sun is rising. "This is my better life My happy ever after" "This is how I'll survive" "My miracle, my answer" "Finding myself" "Changing who I am" "This is the promise That I will always keep" "I will, I will, I will" "For my better life" I think I'm gonna make some tea. It might help me sleep. I'll do that for you. Honey, why don't you make up the bed? Okay. You didn't make the tea. Subtitled by: Captivate Arabia Amman - Jordan
