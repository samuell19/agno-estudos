Selected for the Festival of the Arts 1955 Until the 12th century, the nobility and the priesthood possessed immense estates, which were exempt from tax despite the precarious condition of the national economy. Chaos reigned in the Capital, famine and riot in the provinces. The Fujiwara clan, which for centuries assured the security of the State, was impotent to remedy this situation. Thus it was that the retired Emperor Shirakawa, who was cloistered in a monastery, re-asserted his authority. Japan was torn between this Monk-Emperor and the Imperial Court of the current Emperor, Toba. The nobility called upon professional warriors, the samurai. The monks also created an army, which carried before it the sacred palanquins, repositories for the souls of the venerated dead. So began the struggle for power between the nobility and the priesthood. Momentous events are inevitable... Our story begins in 1137, and takes place in Kyoto, which was then the Capital.

Tomorrow, it will be too late! War and drought are coming! We have two Emperors. There is the drama! It is so true! The nobles and the monks profit from the Imperial Court and their fiefdoms increase! The former Emperor wants to tax them. Both sides raise armies. The future is dark. There won't be a war. Do your work in peace! Buy! Tomorrow, it will be too late! The war is at your doors! Bandits in the mountains, pirates on the sea! The courtiers are incompetent! Buy, while you still can! The warriors of the Ta??ra Clan! The victors over the revolt in the west! Attention, look! The palanquins of the Temple! Prostrate yourselves! Dismount! Let them pass! These monks! The palanquins serve to screen their crimes! Move back! Be prostrate before the sacred palanquins of Mount Hiei! Prostrate, dogs! The Emperor himself bows before them! They carry the spirits of the royal ancestors. Are you going to obey? These are our prisoners, vanquished pirates of the west. Excuse them! Prostrate! For the glory of His Majesty, we, Captain Tadamori and son, defeated the pirates of the west and return this day to our homes. You took your time! It is 4 months since you received His Majesty's order. Is that not so? We are sorry! The enemy forces were large. The battle was fierce. That's no excuse! It is your job to fight! Can we speak of this with His Majesty in person? Impossible! The visit of the Mount Hiei monks regarding the Onjo Temple preoccupies His Majesty. I am sorry. My men returned victorious. Can they hope for an Imperial message? What pretension! Do you forget the social status of the samurai? Get out! Is Tadamori there? I want to congratulate him. Majesty, it would be an unprecedented gesture. Please refrain. He must be rewarded for his victory. He cannot expect anything! He only did his duty. Rich samurai would become a danger! I could ennoble him... Your goodness is infinite. But to raise his status would spoil him. A samurai must live in poverty to remain a valorous warrior. The Master is home! Where is my husband? He died in battle. Our enemies were more numerous than we. Honor his memory. He died as he wished to die. Don't cry! They fell as warriors, a smile on their lips! And my son? He was a hero. Pray for his soul. Did your father miss you? Where is Mother? At a reception at Lord Nakamikado's house. We sent word ahead of our return. She could have waited for us. We shall have to sell a horse, my son. Use the money to buy sake to celebrate our victory. Buy food too! Welcome, young Master! Those monks were furious at you! It's a good thing everything went well! Tell me, will your victory make you rich? You think! I have come to sell this horse. - Give me your best price. - Do you really want to? For a good price. Drink as much as you want! I hoped that we would be received at the Temple. But there is no chance of that now. I was sorely mistaken. Drink therefore, friends, and refresh your minds! Kiyomori! Your first campaign was hard fought. Drink! Drink and forget your disappointments! Let's drink, friends. Drink and sing! Let's go friends, be happy! Everyone, drink and be cheerful! Your sadness offends my father! We don't feel happy. Drink, you will forget your pain. What's the matter with His Majesty? The courtiers slander us, I hate them! These are our rulers! Our deaths and our injuries mean nothing to them! Patience! Your complaints are futile! Our duty is to fight. How can you tolerate it? The courtiers treat us like dogs! Is this just? We are tired of fighting for them! We die uselessly! It cannot continue! Listen to me! We are wild flowers hidden in the soil until they bloom in springtime. It is winter for us. We await the spring! Let's drink and sing! It's our fate, some say, to be born and to die... Life is a dew... fragile and quickly scattered. The breath of the storm carries away the petals of our happy moments. I am back. I don't reproach you for being away. But I came home and you should have been here. Your place is here. Do you believe me so frivolous? I went to make representations on your behalf, attempting to get a just reward for you. Did you ask Tokinobu Fujiwara to intercede for you? No. It is said that he did so and that he has been punished for it. Punished? That is none of our business. Although he is a Fujiwara, Tokinobu has no more influence at Court than you do. Why did he interfere? Why would he grieve himself so? I thought that this time, finally you would be ennobled. We were married by order of Emperor Shirakawa. If you were clever, our situation would change. In the present climate, I see little hope of that. Poverty does not bother you, I know. But I am of noble birth, and I suffer. Even more so in the summer... oh, to give boating parties! Even more so! Can you carry a message? If I didn't have children... What, Mother, would you do? I would have left a long time ago. Shigeko, pass me the skeins. Also those which are dyed. Tokitada! Are you going to the market again? That's none of your business! It is not appropriate! A young man of your rank shouldn't be mixed up in cockfighting. I am only a poor noble! Are you not ashamed? Is the Master at home? Who's asking? Kiyomori Ta??ra. Give him this. These are wonderful! Don't touch them! They will make magnificent fabrics. Are they for the young Lady of the house? I don't think you quite understand... Are you the son of Tadamori? I am touched by his letter. I thought it unjust that His Majesty didn't reward him. I said so. The Ministers took offence. They exiled me to the library. But I prefer the company of books to that of fools! To celebrate your father's victory, and to wish him long life, let's drink to his health. Who is this? My daughter, Tokiko. Take care of our guest. Your hands are all stained. The dye is persistent. I did my best. She likes to dye and to weave. Charming pastime! It is a necessity for our family. She lost her mother very young. Her education has been left wanting. Education is not everything in life! Although noble, I hardly benefit from the advantages of my rank and cannot offer a luxurious life to my children. Please, have another drink. I come to say goodbye. Forgive our poor hospitality. I hope that I did not insult you earlier. Not at all! I found you very frank! You are a noble, but you work? Because we are poor and I like to work. My father hides his bitterness. Come to see him often. Tokitada! Stay here! Catch him! Return home! Don't you interfere! Where are you going? To the cockfights. Come with me. To bet? Be reasonable. Return home. Are you siding with my sister already? What a brave boy! Are you Tokiko's younger brother? Yes. She is tiresome! You are ungrateful! She is marvelous! Do you come here often? I like this place. Why? Here, my worries fade. Here, people live their lives with all their strength. Me, I come to win a little money! Thieves, assassins, all come to satisfy their thirst. And they are happy! Look! They are not responsible for the general disorder. The monks and the nobles, who grow fat, are the true swindlers! Don't be so severe. My father is a noble. But he makes a virtue of his poverty! And we die of hunger! I sometimes envy them. They have luck too. More than I do, at least. We didn't order anything. That customer told me to serve you. Is it you? Which fair wind brings you? I came to buy some Chinese commodities. Why so generous? It is not for me. My friend wants to speak to you. Are you the son of Tadamori? Accept it with my compliments. Banboku is a merchant. Your father would not see him. He is desperate to speak with you. What did you want from my father? To trade on the western seas. We cannot speak here. Come to my home, where it is quieter. I have company. The fight is about to begin. I have to go. You are welcome here. All these goods come from China. They are rare things. Your father is feared by the pirates. However, they control the western seas. Through them, one can import rare goods. I would like to do business with them. You want me to intervene to make you some money. I will be content with a little. No one else thought of it yet. We can all profit from it! My father will refuse. He knows only his duty as a samurai. I know, but you could persuade him. The Captain will not cede. Even to his son. He is a loyal man who has supported the Lady of Gion for 20 years. He never complained. The Lady of Gion? Who do you mean? Don't you know? Tell me? Who is it? Your mother. Don't talk rubbish. My mother cannot be questioned. The Noble Ladies are attached to the apartments of His Majesty. Have you not seen the lantern coat-of-arms at the Temple of Gion? It bears the name of Tadamori. No, why? It is a homage to the bravery of Captain Tadamori. It was twenty years ago. A very beautiful courtesan lived in Gion. Emperor Shirakawa was enamored of her and visited her often at night. She was called the Lady of Gion. Always accompanying His Majesty, were your father and Lesada, his servant. One evening, it had rained heavily... A ghost, there! You frightened His Majesty! Who are you? A servant of the Temple. Save me, I beg you! Have mercy! He was a poor devil! Don't laugh! Tadamori could have killed him! Give him a drink. He has the calm courage of the samurai. You seem to forget your own emotions! The Lady of Gion was seduced by his bravery. A short time later, the Emperor ennobled her and married her to your father. You were born shortly after. A few months too early... Too early? I could be the son of the retired Emperor? That is the rumor. Come on, drink! Why do you reject me? Where am I? Don't you know? Don't come near me! Don't put on grand airs! You are only a courtesan's son! Who told you that? You spoke of it with your friend. He left a long time ago. Remain here with me. Lie back! Stay here! What's this!? I can't see in the dark! Your name? Where do you think you are? These are sacred weapons, a commoner doesn't have the right to touch them. Excuse me. You wear the hairstyle of the Ta??ra clan. I apologize. He runs quickly! We could have tapped him for some cash. Just a worthless boy! Lesada! Is it you, Master? You are back very late! Hurry off to bed. Come here! What happened? What happened to you? Answer me honestly. I must know. Is it true that I am not my father's son? Who told you that? Banboku, a merchant, and Mitsuto also told me that it was true. I am the son of Shirakawa, the retired Emperor. Did he tell you that? He had no right to say such things. And do you believe this vulgar man? Come on, let's go to sleep! You must know the truth! - I don't know anything. - Liar! You were with my father when the Emperor was visiting the Lady of Gion. Tell me if I am his son! Tell me! Very well, I shall tell you. It is true, I went with your father. It was an autumn evening... His Majesty is here! Stop him! Go! You are quiet? Why did he run away? What happened here? Speak! Excuse me, forgive me. Who is the child's father? This man? You are cruel. You are still a common whore! Why did you let him flee? To divert the shame from me? You are going to marry this woman. Me? She carries a child, it doesn't matter whose it is. If you marry her, all will be back in order. Don't you want to marry her? That is everything that I know. I could be a monk's son? I don't know. Whose son am I? The Master loves you, as one loves his own child. I believed I was the son of a samurai. Then I believed I was the son of the Emperor. Now I could also be the son of a debauched monk! Explain that to me! Don't try to understand now. Get some sleep... It does not matter who your father is. You are strong and courageous. Are you not happy with that? You speak very eloquently, but I cannot agree. Let me leave this house. Thank you for everything. Calm down. Kiyomori will apologize to you. There is no excuse. Mother and you, Father, whose son am I? You heard him! He persists! Tell him that I am innocent! Who else can your father be? Mother, you must know. Tell me! How dare you? For twenty years, I have lived as a samurai's wife, for the sake of our children, and this is my reward! This house is no longer my home! Don't leave us! If I offended you, I beg your forgiveness. My brothers are so young! Stay! Release me! Don't leave us! If you are a mother, stay to comfort me. My decision is final. You are not a mother! You dare to insult the Emperor's mistress! Say that again! Let her go. She always despised our clan. Father, tell me the truth. Whose child did you raise? The son of the Emperor, treated considerately or the son of a debauched monk, elevated for mercy's sake? You ramble. You are my son. "The Temple of Hakusan has been destroyed by fire, and its lands are, consequently, confiscated by the Provincial Government." These are the orders of the Court of the Monk-Emperor. This temple belongs to the Order of Mount Hiei. We won't accept this decision! You will be punished if you disobey. We remain faithful to our Order. We defy the Provincial Government! The Temple has thousands of peasants in its domain we won't let them die of hunger! Your arguments are just. But the decision remains. This decision was taken by the retired Emperor. But, in reality it is from here that Japan is governed. We ask the Emperor Tobu to dismiss this decree! It is of little value to you, Prime Minister. What shall we do? The peasants come to ask us for asylum, there are thousands of them. If you take the estates, you take responsibility for them too. Would it not be just to accede to their request? The policies of the Monk-Emperor require that we confiscate all estates named in the decree. He would not make exceptions, even for the Order of Mount Hiei. So our Order enjoys no privilege? For centuries, we have been the spiritual heart and unconditional supporters of the Imperial Throne! In the present circumstances, it will be necessary for us to withdraw that support. Do you want that? What do you think? Could the matter not be reconsidered? We regret bothering Your Majesty, but we are worried. May I ask for some indulgence for the Order of Mount Hiei? A Prime Minister should not be subject to such petty fears... Their demands concerning this estate must be rejected. Is Captain Ta??ra here? He waits to be received. We designate Captain Tadamori for this campaign, because of his bravery and his humility at the time of his return from the western seas. Gather our men. An expedition? To Kaga province. We need three hundred warriors. We leave on campaign. Warn the men. Saddle the horses! Check the weapons! We are going to subdue a revolt by the monks of Hakusanji. Did you accept? It is an order. I don't agree! You must come with me. Have you forgotten our return from the west? Should we sell another horse? Calm yourself! His Majesty recognized my merits. I cannot disobey. And did he honor you? I understand the meaning of his favors. His Majesty married a mistress of the ex-Emperor Shirakawa just as you married my mother. He too believes that his son is that of Emperor Shirakawa. This situation explains the sympathy between you. Shut up! Are you anticipating his respect? Me, no! Dwell no more on the secret of your birth. Please, don't patronize me! If it is thus, don't come with me. I kept you waiting. Who was that? Minister Anenokoji. You receive a lot of people. If a pirate chief comes, let me know. You're joking! Not at all. I want to live like a pirate or a bandit, not fight for the monks or the courtiers! I understand you. But think, please. The pirates are outlaws. This nation is yours to take, if you want it! How's that? The times change. The Court, the nobles, depend on the samurai, to collect their taxes. The hour of the samurai is near. Besides, I had wind of excellent news. His Majesty, most satisfied with your father's services in the campaign against the monks of Hakusanji, has awarded him an estate and ennobled him. My Father, at Court! An unprecedented fact! To him, it means nothing... It's not a matter for your father alone. The destiny of the samurai awaits. Besides, you are the son of Emperor Shirakawa. Noble blood flows in your veins. You will achieve high rank. Be patient! Never mind my father! I want to live my life! Not to depend on anyone! You speak well! That pleases me! Sell me your future. I bet my fortune on you. Do you want it? I agree. Let's begin. I already have something to ask you. Give me silk. Is that all? Why do you laugh? Is your Mistress here? Announce me. A visitor, Mistress. I brought you this. I thought that you would appreciate it. What pretty silk! Chieko, come to see! Why such a sumptuous gift? It is nothing. Don't worry, I won't always be a poor samurai. Did I ever mention it? Your rank has never been important to me! You are right. I would like a kimono like that one. It is yours. I wove it for you. Thank you. Since my mother's departure, no one takes care of me. My father requested it for you. But I made it for you! I am happy that it pleases you. Your carriage is ready, Master! Let's drink to the health of our Master! We celebrate the honor given to your Father. Come! A charitable gesture? Don't say that! Come with us. Is Captain Tadamori there? What happened? A plot! Where is Captain Tadamori? He left for the Palace. Kiyomori also? No, he is here. What is it? Your father is in danger. The courtiers want to murder him tonight. They can't accept a samurai becoming a dignitary of the Empire! The cowards! They won't kill him! The banquet is nearly finished. Are you ready? Tadamori is a tough warrior. Be clever and prudent. Your father is back in the great hall. This banquet was a rare pleasure for me. You are beautiful, Lady of Gion! You flatter me! I suffered so much as a samurai's wife. The elevation of Tadamori must gladden you. Don't be ridiculous, he will always be just a vulgar samurai. I am afraid that he will be a very mediocre courtier! We will educate him. If your solitude is too great, come to see me. I am honored of your invitation. Come with some young girls and pretty dancers. So that's the reason you want me to come to you! Are you jealous? Where are the guards? Tadamori is coming. All of you leap out and kill him! Wait for my signal. Don't move! I am the son of Tadamori. I heard you. Just you try to kill him now! To speak of plots is offensive enough. But to enter the Palace with weapons, with warriors, is even worse! What have you to say in his defense? The custom is that the son of a samurai attends to his father's last moments. With sword in hand? For a good reason, it seems. My son is not to blame. I am ready to assume all responsibility for his behavior! You admit your transgression. I ask therefore that Tadamori be deprived of its title and stripped of his estates. But they were given to him by the former Emperor! His crime falls under our jurisdiction. Don't fear the Monk-Emperor! I have orders to conduct Tadamori to the Temple of the Monk-Emperor. Him again! What shall we do now? Tadamori, go! They are back! There they are! - There are only three! - Where is the Master? Where is the Master? Don't be afraid. The courtiers failed, so now they are trying to blame the Master for our intervention. The cowards! The traitors! Isn't he still in danger? Let's go to his aid! My father is with the Monk-Emperor. Let's wait calmly for his return. Finally, Father! Minister Yorinaga wanted us condemned, you and I, together. But I am the only guilty party! I took on the responsibility for this offence. But the Monk-Emperor appreciated your courageous attitude and that of our brave warriors. What an honor! We are happy! You must be tired. Go take a rest. Your promptness in coming to my aid comforted me. I was much saddened by your indifference. As soon as I knew that you were in danger, I ran to you, Father. Of course, I wanted to protect you but also, I wanted to show them that nothing will prevent the samurai achieving power. Don't fear anything, whatever they say. You became a man, my son. This business ended well for us, but Tokinobu has been banished from the Court. He made the mistake of warning us, and has been condemned for it. The Fujiwara Clan has been banished, and their estate seized. Can he be part of ours? I would like to marry Tokiko. I didn't know! At my age, one misses all manner of things! You are Kiyomori's brother-in-law? I always enjoy a feast! I want to drink, pass me your bowl. There are others! I want this one. Fool! You think that I'd drink from a bowl soiled by samurai lips? You insult us! Do you want to fight? I am your man! These monks are rogues. And they are too many for those boys! They are monks of the Hiei Mount. They won't last long. What is it? I would like a stream in this garden. It would be convenient to dye my skeins, and I could weave kimonos for you, Father, and you, my husband. This house is too old to be altered. You need a new one now that you are married. This one is no longer suitable for your status. We will keep it for ourselves. I don't wish to change. I want to end my life here. No. Think of your future and build the house that you need. Tokitada, your brother-in-law, is wounded. - He fought the monks! - The monks? - Where is he? - Under the porch. Close the gates! I fought with some monks! How imprudent! They provoked me! Why didn't you try to flee? They rushed upon us. I had told you to be careful! They provoked him deliberately because he joined our clan! Open the gates! I am Kiyomori Ta??ra. What's this shouting on my doorstep? Deliver Tokitada up to us, and his friend! They wounded our monks and insulted us! Bring them to us! I refuse! You provoked this incident yourselves! You embarrass the robes that you wear! You harbor our enemies! Fear our wrath! They must repent! Our palanquins carry the souls of dead Emperors. The Court respects them and confides in our priests! Kiyomori dared to oppose our authority. We cannot tolerate it. Without reference to us, our estate of Hakusanji has been given to the Ta??ras! The Monk-Emperor rejects our complaints and turns away from us! The peasants of the estate suffer. Don't abandon them! Must we use force? Yes or no? Make haste to the Capital! Let's carry the palanquins into the City. They will be scared to death! Let's carry the palanquins! Are you alone? Where is Tadamori? He's appearing before the Ministers with his son. Bring them here. They are innocent. The sacred palanquins may arrive at any moment. Protecting the Ta??ras will provoke the monks. Let us convene the Court. Tadamori is ready to sacrifice himself for Your Majesty. I don't want that. No one can withstand the palanquins. Tadamori, won't you speak? You rely on the Monk-Emperor? Surrender Tokitada and his friend before the palanquins arrive. To protect them is a provocation. You don't have the right to do it not as clan chief, and not as magistrate. These young men won't die. Punish the blasphemous priests! Insolence! How dare you speak here thus! You endanger the Throne! You will lose your estates! You are banished from the Court! Get out! You should never have had a place among us! Leave! You, throw this samurai out! One moment. Let me try one last thing. The monks of Mount Hiei want vengeance against our clan! I undertake to put a end to this dispute. Presumptuous young man! We won't forget these words! Will you face the monks alone? The Master is back. Master! You are home! Father! Too late! Your mother is here. What does she want? She abandoned her family. She may not enter here! Big brother! Surely she has come to mourn our father. Forgive her! I am going to get her. You brought misfortune on this house. It is all your fault. Tokitada, accept your responsibilities. The Ta??ras are in danger. Kiyomori accepted us into his clan, and allied with us. We don't have the right to ruin him. Surrender yourself. I asked him. He won't hear of it. Why this fan? He held it between his hands as he died. While dying... In his hands? Do you know what it means? I don't know. I can tell you now that he is dead. Tadamori wrote this poem. The first line of it is "The fruit of your loins is born. Oh, Procreator!" The second line was written by Emperor Shirakawa. "Keep him, with my blessing." Now you understand. These verses explain and prove your identity. They were written down to leave a permanent record. You are the son of Emperor Shirakawa. Tadamori, while dying, wanted to send you this final message. No one can contest your lineage now. Come with me to the Palace. Mother! I am an illegitimate child. I can rely on myself alone. I am confident of my own strength. And what of a mother's love? You want to disavow your heritage, to die miserably far from home? Father devoted his life to the Emperor's service. He died persecuted by the Court! I want to destroy the part of me that is the blood of Shirakawa! Don't say such a thing! Get out of here! Take her away! The monks of Mount Hiei march with the palanquins! Let me surrender! - Please. - Please let us. Bring me my armor. Sir! It's terrifying! You won't stop me! Why would I want to? The future belongs to you. Continue! I am with you. You are on the right path. You bet on me. You are going to see! Prepare yourselves! Neither the Imperial Court nor the Monk-Emperor agreed to our demands for restitution! It is unacceptable! It is a shame! They disown the tradition and the faith of their forebears. We cannot retreat any further. Our prestige is at stake! Let's give them proof of the power of the palanquins! To the Temple of the Monk-Emperor! Let's take the palanquins! Silence! Listen to me! Quiet! Let's listen to what he has to say. Kiyomori, do you surrender the criminals to us? Tokitada and his friend are here. They are yours. But the punishment must be shared. Your men sought out the quarrel. If you touch either of them, the palanquins will answer to me. You are mad! Even the Emperor respects them! On your knees! Sacrilege! Shut up, monks! It's not the gods who persecute men! Maybe the palanquins are sacred. But in the hands of you rogues, they are sullied. They are weapons of the devil! Blasphemous words! They contain the souls of Emperors from centuries past! You will go straight to Hell! You are a sinner and you will die damned! Watch this! Father, the superstition that reigned over this country for 300 years, vanished at the points of my arrows... The Mount Hiei monks vowed to see me dead, the Court is in chaos. But the people and some nobles too, are with me. I feel it, the big moment approaches. Whenever it arrives, Father, I won't be afraid! I will be worthy of you. Have confidence in me. I like this song. I composed it for your pleasure, in honor of this day. You are as erudite as you are beautiful! We can learn much from each other. There is your mother. She has a troupe of dancers. It was her original profession. She must be happy with them. Keep away from the Lord's party. Nobles and courtiers, amuse yourselves while you may! The end of your reign approaches. Tomorrow belongs us. English Subtitles: NiX for FileHeaven From the French by Daniel JEAN
