[screaming] I don't care if it's a mob-owned club! I don't even care if it's a Jesus H. Christ owned club. We can't do the gig! Is this Chippendales? Auditions aren't until next week. Are you Nick Denoia? It depends on who's asking. Nick was many things to many people. Artist. Visionary. A pain in the ass. An inspiration. A man who made Chippendales. But I'll tell you, the last thing any of expected him to be was the end of an era. When Chippendales first opened, he was a popular backgammon club. But his tastes changed, so did the entertainment. Some mud wrestling led to a ladies night or two, then three. The crowds of women wouldn't let up, Chippendales became the first ex all-male strip bar. Before you could say "it's raining men" Chippendales had gotten quite a reputation. Take Spencer for instance. He stood outside eery night hoping to be discovered and hired to dance inside. You see, the secret was getting out. Chippendales not only had the most women in one place time, it had the most horny women in one place at one time. Why? Because these ladies bought what we were selling. A fantasy. The last thing they wanted to know was that Royce here had a wife and a kid waiting for him at home. Put those hands together and spread those legs apart. I have a gentleman I want you to meet. Or that Clayton was only interested in dating casting directors to help his acting career. And he had a sixty-eight year-old sugar mama who paid his bills. Or, that of all people, he, Steve Banerjee, was the one who thought this whole Chippendales thing up. The fantasy was h A fantasy that was too much for even me to resist. This is stupid. Man, I don't even know w Fresh off the bus? Let me guess. Iowa. Close. Orange Country. Just moved up here with Yep. The money. You're here for the money. Steve may have asked you to come in here, but he's a guy. Hey. He doesn't really know what the ladies like, so if you wanna ge Steve that the ladies love you. Trade secret? Look each and every one of them in the eyes. Like you're about to penetr Even the fatties. Okay? Give them the ride of their lives. * * It's raining men, hallelujah * It's raining men Hey, hey Yes, Mr. Banerjee Hey, call me steve. The ladies, they desire you. I think they will be happier with the tips The revue will be your new job. And so, there I was. The fantasy. A Chippendale. Will? What has gotten into you? I have some good news. Go on. While you were at work, I was at work. Oh my god! That's awesome. You got a job? Yeah, Chippendales. As in the dancing guys? Yeah. I was right here yesterday, laying the owner discovered me. Isn't that great? No. That's majorly lame. You just got your Masters in Business. What about owning your own company? Are you just going to throw it all away? No. I'm going to learn how to run a business first hand. And then I'm going to move on. Heather, the money is so good. I mean, w need the money. Not that bad. What would you rather have? Me or this j Heather, don't do this. Wrong answer. Heather. We've done spot checks three nights this week. Each and every time, there's been a drastic violation of fire code. Is it because you are afraid of the sexuality of the men that you give me such a difficult time? No, it's because you're breaking the law I can only make a profit by fitting more women than your capacity allows. Please. Is there anything I can do? Follow the fire safety regulations. And lose the extra money? That I cannot do. If you continue with the violations, the city will shit you down Now, I suggest you take care of the over crowding, or we will do it for you. Hello ladies, welcome to Chippendales. I'll be your host My name is Chad. Where are you all from? Santa Monica. You all ready to have a good time? Yeah! That's too bad. Because I'm going show you a great time! You better, because if you don't I'm goi sue you for false advertising. Oh really? We have a lawyer in the house First year of law school, UCLA. Ah. MBA, UC Irvine. Maybe you could save some room for a little dessert later. * I don't know why you want to hire a choreographer. You make this show any better, you're going to have even more women crowding in here to catch the action. I move forward. I didn't get the way I am today by sitting back and bleeding down to the asphalt. You don't have to let the fire department bug you. Never hurt anybody. Oh yeah! Well if you're hungry for more man-loving, we've got a guy that's going to satisfy your appetite. He is the unknown, the stripper! * Maybe I can offer them a gift. Say, of, ten thousand dollars. To turn the other face, huh? I don't know, Steve. Then how much for you to scare the fire department? Excuse me? A bomb. Maybe that will get them off my back. You want to burn down the fire department? Maybe you should be running a comedy club, Steve, because that's real fucking funny. * [screaming] Sorry, excuse me. Wanna finish her off? I have to go, I'm up next. Not tonight, love to help you out. Hi Chad. Uh, girlfriend. So do I. And she'll be happy to join us. Hi. Hi. * * Oh my god! Hey, how about a toast? To the overeducated, and the undersexed. You or me? I don't even know you. To tell you the truth, You're really not that far off. We should fix that. I can't. I'm usually not so easy, this is a limited offer. Really, I can't. Girlfriend. Seven years. Since high school. No itch to scratch? Nope. She's lucky. Sorry. * Kill the music. Take it off! Take it off! You got a court order or something? Take it off! It's your show now, buddy. Take it off! Take it off! Excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you to walk slowly and carefully to the exits. Chippendales Nightclub is closed for business. Boo! Hey. Remember us? We thought maybe if we gave you some time to think it over. I thought about it. Well, this will be our little secret. Our lips are so sealed. Brittany was a centerfold last May, did you see her? Um, not everything, there was this staple. So what will it be cowboy, the staple the creases, or the living, breathing real me? Shit! Heather? Heather! Honey "I'm only in it for the money" Hah! It was them, okay? I wasn't doing anythi I actually came by to apologize. You know, I wanted to be a good girlfriend and support you. The club was closed down. Okay, I don't even work here anymore. Don't even bother coming home. Your stuff will be on the porch. How do you explain to a women that you're trying to build a future for the both of you, and it can't always You must accept that there are people like those fire-fuckers, huh? Who are not good to be having, no matter how good your meaning. My girlfriend, she broke up with me. You come into this world alone as you leave it. To think of oneself before others is not a crime. I say fuck everyone. Tomorrow morning here, you will help me. But you're closed. Those fuckers. They can close my club, but they can't close me. You now work full-time for me. [radio static] * Come on! Hey, you work here? Who wants to know? Yeah, you don't, do you? No, but, if the chicks think so, I do al I bet you'd do a lot better if you worke winning the lottery. I know. Hey, Nick, Nick Denoia. I used t West Side Story original cast. Spencer. Wow, awesome, dude. On Broadway. Of course.

Yeah, I'm looking for Steven Banerjee, I Nick Denoia. We're closed. I got a call from Mr. Banerjee, he told me to come in for a meeting, he said he's looking for Sorry man, the city shut us down. No way! What for? Overcrowding. Oh see, I know a way around that. You ju two shows a night and make them each half as long as the one you were do will notice.

Oh, and the watering down the booze. I'm not going anywhere empty-handed. You know, much of my life has been spent on the road doing touring theatre. Hello Dolly, Cabaret. We would travel from town to town and we'd bring a little bit of culture to those without any. I can do the same thing with Chippendales. With my own cast. A touring show. That would be mine.
