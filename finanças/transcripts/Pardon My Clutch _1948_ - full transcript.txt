[♪] Tell me, how is he, Claude? I gave him one of these sleeping pills about 10 minutes ago. That's the best thing in the world for him. Rest and sleep. But don't you think we ought to call a doctor? Why throw money away? I can take care of Shemp better than any doctor. Sure, he can. Just follow the directions till I get back. I'm gonna get my doctor book. We'll have Shemp as good as new. Sure. Take one pill, wait 15 minutes, then take a second pill. Hey, it's time for the second pill. Fifteen minutes. Right. Let's go. Now, don't worry about everything. Anything will be all right! Oh! Now, don't worry. [SNORING] Oh, he's sleeping like a baby. It's a shame to disturb him. Yeah, but he's gotta take his second pill so he can sleep. Maybe you've got something there. Okay, kid. We-- [SNORING] Come on. Come on, Shemp. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Get up. You gotta take a pill. What, again? Yeah, again. Here. Come on. Down the hatch. Now let me get back in bed. Oh, not so fast. You're gonna follow instructions. Now that you've taken the pill, you gotta skip an hour. Get him the rope. Here. Take that. Now, skip. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. Here. One in each hand. [GROANS] Start skipping. That's that. No, no. We'll let you know when the hour's up. Continue. [SNORING] Well, that's that. Skip! Skip! You wake me up... Where are the boys? They've been in with Shemp for over an hour. They have? [ALL SNORING] Hey! [MUMBLING] What's the big idea? He's following the instructions on the bottle. Yeah. It says take two pills and skip an hour. You dopes. That means to wait an hour before you give him his next pill. Now he tells us. I've got my doctor book right here. I'll have his case diagnosed in nothing flat. You sit right down there. [YAWNS] A-ha. Oh-ho. Oh-ho. What is it, doc? Nothing. He's got a rash. It tells you right here, a rash may be caused by excessive use of the grey matter of the brain. Oh, it must be something else. Sure, can't be that. It also says a rash may be caused by a bad tooth. You got something there. Let's have a look. [GRUNTING] Well, none of them came out. Yet. Here. Open wide. [YELPS] [YELPS] [YELLS] A-ha! That's the one! Are you tellin' me. Get me a piece of strong string. What are you gonna do, doc? I'm gonna pull that bad tooth. Is it gonna hurt? No, I don't think so. Here's the string. Tie a nice sailor's knot. Got it around? Yeah. Follow me. [MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY] Sit down. All set? [MUMBLES] [YELLS] [YELLS] Take it easy, kid. Quiet. Larry, untie that line. We'll do it the old, reliable way. Come on. All right. Now, take it easy, kid. We'll have that thing out before you can say Ticonderoga. If you can say Ticonderoga. All right. Back up just a little bit. Okay, sonny boy? [MUMBLES] All right. Ready! [YELLING] Oh, what a tooth. No wonder it was killin' me. You nitwit. That's the doorknob. Oh, yeah? Come on. [YELLS] Why, you imbecile. All we're trying to do is give you a hand, here, so you can get out-- [YELLS] I'm dead, I'm tired. He shot me. Get a doctor. Do something. Oh, quiet, picklepuss. All he did was pull your tooth. Is that all? Thanks. I feel like a million bucks. Easy. You'll soon be a well man. Especially if you go away for a couple of weeks. Yeah. We'll go-- Wait a minute. We haven't got a car. Oh, you lucky people. I've got a car. It isn't exactly brand new, but it's in perfect condition. How much? I'll let you steal it from me for 900 bucks. We'll take it. Fine. I'll have it here in the morning. And to show you I'm a right guy, let you have my camping outfit. I'll bring it over tonight. That's what you call a real pal. Yeah. We can camp near a lake and catch all the fish we can eat. You know, fish is great brain food. You know, you should fish for a whale. Out of here. Hey, Larry. Shemp passed out. Get some water. No, champagne. Come on. Look. He must've left the root in there. ♪ In the old campgrounds ♪ Hey, Moe. What? Don't you think we ought to practice putting this tent up before we leave? I think you got something there, porcupine. Let's ask Claude how to do it. Nonsense. I know all about tents. Let's go. Get her right out flat, boys. Open that side. That goes over. MOE: I used to be a Boy Scout. LARRY: Yeah. Okay. Now, raise that pole. Lift that tent. Further, further. [YELLS] Oh, a wise guy. [YELLS] Remind me to murder you later. I'll make a note of it. [YELLS] Come on. Get it up, boy. Get me the other pole, Shemp. [ALL CHATTERING] Right under my arm, here. Right under the arm. I'll get it up there. Right up here. Watch your arm. How is that? Pretty good. All right. Narcissus! WOMAN: Yes? Up. Hold this pole. All right. Tie it off, dummy. All right, I'll tie it off.

Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, quit monkeying around, you guys. Here we go. Careful. Ha-ha. What do we do now? I wonder how they got the tire on. LARRY: Be a-- Wait. Yeah. All right. SHEMP: Easy. That's right, just-- No. You think if I got the hatchet and chopped-- Oh, come on, come on. All right. What seems to be the trouble? We can't get the tire past the jack. Why, you nitwits. Get out of there. You wanna get hurt? Let a man do it that knows how. You gotta use your brain. All you do is give it one quick jerk. Oh! Oh, my foot. My foot, it's cut off. Help!

Not unless you got $15.97. Now, you don't understand. We were changing tires and it got away from us. It ain't gonna get away from me. Let go of that rubber, or I'll take this hammer and rap you over the noggin. Oh, yeah? I'd like to see you try it. Oh! Hey, pal, down in Texas, you can't get away with that. Tell him, Tex. Look, partner, I'm-- Oh! I'd like to see you do that again. Oh! By golly, he did it. Now, look, pal. Can't we reason this thing out like gentlemen? After all, we're sensible-- Attaboy.
