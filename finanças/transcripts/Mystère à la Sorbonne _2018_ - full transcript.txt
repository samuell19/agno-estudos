MYSTERY AT THE SORBONNE Get back home! We don't want you here! Will you marry me? You're useless! Women out! Go home! Darn some socks! Look after the children! Clean up! What's your name, little girl? Did you get lost? This is a university, not a department store! Women shouldn't study! It's Garbot! I thought I'd walked into an aviary. Or worse: into parliament. Let's have some order. Is this lady's presence the problem? Well, you'll have to get used to it. And in silence. Let us begin. Whether your client has killed his mother, his son or even the president is no concern of yours. What is your concern? To exonerate him. He may have been wrongly charged or he may be a murderer such as Gilles de Rais. It makes no difference. You must defend him, with the same vigor. Why is that? You, there. Because it's the law. Like your pants, young man, that is a little short. And how do you defend a guilty man? The man in the check suit. You begin by looking for procedural irregularities. Of course. And why is that? Because there will always be a detail that has not been respected. Excellent answer. You can read, even if you can't think. Should procedure be followed if it will exonerate someone you know to be guilty? I don't recall inviting you to speak, young lady. True, but you haven't answered me. The procedure must be strictly followed. The court aims to ascertain probable innocence, not definite innocence. You mean, legally, the letter outweighs the spirit? This isn't a café. I ask the questions. Is that because I'm a woman? Get back to your mother! Come in. I'm sorry to bother you, Dean, but I'm looking for Prof. Sarde. He's in the staff library. Try not to obtrude, Miss Missonnier. And not only in the library. You're not welcome here. But my admission was authorized. Or am I wrong? You were indulged. Wrongly, in my opinion. The law faculty aims to produce excellence. As such, it is the preserve of men. Some people look kindly upon educated women. Know that I am not one of them. I personally believe your place is in the home, not at a university. My place is my own choosing. I hope you choose somewhere where you'll be largely unseen. -Understood? -Yes. You're very instructive. Mrs. Joseph! Take this young lady to the library, -if you'd be so kind. -Yes, Sir. Last month we had a circus runaway. Now they're admitting women. I've seen it all. Prof. Sarde? Is anyone here? Quick! Help! Help! It's coming from the library! Don't go in! Let me through! Excuse me. This is horrible, sir. I did everything I could to save him, I swear. Watch her. I'll fetch the police. This is absurd. It wasn't me. If I'd wanted to kill him, I wouldn't have said that I was looking for him. The suspect asked to see Prof. Sarde. Then we found her by his body, with a knife in her hand. I said that admitting women to university would end in disaster, but I didn't expect this! Male or female, the world divides into the innocent and the guilty. Since Eve it's been clear that women usually belong to the second category. Ah, Prof. Garbot! It's been some time since we crossed swords in court. I was wondering if you'd been retired. I gave up litigation, to concentrate on teaching. I can assure you that students are more tiring than criminals. I'm glad to hear that. I thought you'd fallen from favor. How are you, Inspector? Crime has been flourishing in Paris since your arrival. I can't imagine you're bored. Enough fun. Which way is it? Follow me. Step aside. Clear the way! Study elsewhere! Down with the police! Who said that? I've no time for this rabble. Inspector, I hope this can be kept quiet. If we could avoid the front page of the newspapers... Take her away. No, let me go. Let me go. He was dead when I found him. Please, let me go. I'm innocent. Innocent! Stop this! Let me go! Let me go, please! Professor! Help me, please. The lady's right. A criminal found at the crime scene, with a weapon. That's a case for you. I just need to find a motive. What motive? Women have instincts, not motives. All are equal before the law. And the guillotine. What humanism, Levallois. Professor, please! Believe me, I beg you! This man seems bizarre, don't you think? He's dead. That's true, but still. He's dead but well shaved. Yes. With beautiful hands. I like your Cartesian mindset. Wait. Good. Let us begin. I swear, it wasn't me. Stop this! I caught you red-handed, with the victim's blood on your hands. What's this? I promise you... Well now. Gentlemen. I don't recall sending for you. I didn't need you to. I am this lady's lawyer. You're brave, to get back in the ring. Thank you. Follow me, please, young lady. -Let's go. -Don't move. Out of respect for the man you were, Garbot, I'll ask you to leave. Let me question her. May I? You arrested Miss Victoire Missonnier for the murder of a male teacher. But no male teacher has been killed. Listen... I heard you'd lost your touch, but not your head. Murder was committed, but not of a male teacher. The victim was a women, Inspector. If you'd be so kind, young lady. A false mustache. I saw her bosom. Your warrant is invalid, due to that irregularity. We can go, young lady. Don't get too high and mighty. I'll draw up a new warrant, in due form. I'll arrest her within 24 hours! Goodbye. This won't be like your poison woman! You won't acquit this one! Rivolier. Follow them. Thank you. Don't thank me. I was satisfying my curiosity more than I was helping. My colleagues aren't killed every day. Nor do they turn out to be women that have been murdered by one of my own students. I set our chances at around 90%. Of losing, of course. I hope you're on good terms with God. You may meet Him soon, in quite an abrupt manner. I didn't kill Charles Sarde. -That's not at all important. -It is to me. When I saw him, he wasn't dead. I tried to resuscitate him. That was foolish. Should I have left him to die? Reason would suggest as much. Then I acted unreasonably. Well, a hopeless case such as yours will require the brightest students. But, like miracles, I've often heard of them, without actually seeing any. What do you think about women's education? You may leave. How does contact with criminals make you feel? Why should I choose you rather than your horse-faced friend? We'll have to accept the passable, rather than the bright. What do you think of women at university? It's... progress? But... we mustn't allow too many. Thank you. We'll have to take someone that isn't completely stupid. The French civil code specifies that married woman are legally incapable, which means, practically, they are forbidden from access to higher education, from entering into contracts, traveling abroad, working, or managing their own assets without their husband's consent, which is clearly unfair, from the woman's point of view. Your name? François Lieuret. Mr. Lieuret, sit at the front, please. Marcellin! Was that bet rigged? Give me back my money. There's been a misunderstanding... Ah! Marcellin! You're just in time. Summarize the penal code, book 5. What's my interest in helping with this case? I didn't mention your help or a case. Professor... Your lectures haven't changed in the last ten years. So I assume that your question about the rights of women must relate to the murder of Charles Sarde? Am I wrong? So... What will be in it for me, if I help to exonerate this woman? You'll pass the year. That would be good, wouldn't it? I want full marks in criminal law. Seventy-five percent. Good luck. The blond chap will be of great help. He seems very r-r-relaxed. -Eighty-five percent. -Ninety-five percent. -Ninety. -92.5 and a kiss from the lady. OK, let's start with an absurd hypothesis. Something implausible. Miss Victoire Missonnier's innocence. If she didn't kill Charles Sarde, then we need to find out who did. There! There are four basic motives: money, jealousy, revenge and sex. So, our mission is simple: to enter the criminal's mind. To think like her. Know the guilty party and you'll find your murderer. Know your victim and you'll find your murderer. We need to question everyone that knew Charles Sarde: students, colleagues... I want to know everything. Gather all the clues. What she reads, who she sees, whom she likes to rub up against... her favorite recipe, everything. Find out who Sarde was and what she wanted. What did you want from Charles Sarde? I wanted to enroll in his class on penal procedures. If you have any questions about penal procedures, address them to me. It'll keep you out of the dock. I want results, on my desk, by tomorrow evening. Get to it! What will Levallois and the public see as your main shortcoming? Being a woman? Levallois will be hard on you. He'll look at everything, since your birth. -I hope you're not hiding anything. -No. Then I'll ask you again. This will remain confidential. I need to know the truth. I'm innocent. You're not a man, I hope. OK, see you tomorrow, at seven o'clock. Wait, Levallois will be back to arrest me within 24 hours. I can't just go home and do nothing. Then say goodbye to your loved-ones. Inspector Levallois will be there to arrest you at 6 p.m. tomorrow. And use the time to buy a new suit. You look like a hoodlum. A suit like yours? The undertaker look? No, Lieuret. Stay here. So, you turn up six months late, you interrupt Garbot's lecture, you contradict him, and you get accused of murder too. What are you scared of? Not being noticed? And you're a brazen cheat. Do you want to be sent down? No, no... Unmasking imposters is my thing. I'm proud to say I've had to redo several years and I know that Garbot's lectures never change. And the money? I like to do favors for people, but you wouldn't want the details. Other than that, do you still live at home? No, I live in a women's hostel. You must get lonely. Would you like some company? I have better things to do tonight. Papa. Ah, Victoire. So, how was your first day? Was it all you'd hoped for? It was better. And how were your classmates? I hope they didn't react badly to seeing the first woman there. No, everyone was very polite. I'm so proud to have a daughter like you. To think that you made it. That you managed to get into the Sorbonne. Thank you, Papa. I may not be here much in the coming days. My schedule is very busy. But I won't forget you. I swear, I can handle this. Your happiness is all that matters to me. The victim's blood still on her hands! You deserve to be found guilty, after so much foolishness. Your happiness is all that matters to me. So? Go over to the prison. I think you'll like what you see. It's Augustin Missonnier, the suspect's father. Ten years for the father, decapitation for the daughter. As they say, bad blood will out. Here, have a drink. You know... The news I have isn't good. In my situation... One can always sink a little lower. It's not about you. My daughter? Did someone harm her? That would have been preferable, but unfortunately it's the opposite. So, what did Garbot want, yesterday? He asked me to watch Victoire. He said my grant would be cut if I didn't comply. The swine! Do you think she's guilty? I hope so. Imagine the pleasure of flirting with a criminal. Come on, Garbot's expecting us. Right, I thought a lot, last night. What is the question that we need to ask? Why did that woman take so many risks to study at the Sorbonne, under a false identity? What did she want? Speak to all the students. Find out what they know about Sarde. -I'll do it. -Stay there. Remember, you're the main suspect. Just keep a low profile, if it's not too much to ask. I'll speak to the students. What is that hat? This? It's a straw boater. I'm starting a new fashion. Do you like it? Undertakers have no opinion on matters of dress. You sound peeved. And should I...? -Yes, Lieuret? -Yes? No, nothing. Then off you go. Hello, I... Excuse me. You knew Charles Sarde well. A little. He was a well-known lawyer. What would the noun be for a woman? A "lawyeress"? -A "lawyerette"? -A "lawyereen"? Why would a woman flout so many prohibitions to come here? To learn, dear friend. The education of women represents the greatest of dangers. Imagine the disaster that would ensue if they managed to understand and change the law. All professors have their quirks. Didn't you notice anything in Sarde? Are you going out? -Garbot said not to. -We need to talk. I want to search for Sarde's address. You can watch the dean's door. What a naughty girl! You'll have me thinking you are the murderer. Nothing scares you. Under threat of the guillotine, things can't get worse. This way is faster. This may seem hasty, but will you be my wife? Look out! What are you doing? That student is an undercover policeman. How do you know? You may have noticed, he doesn't have a briefcase. And no student can afford kid gloves. Come on. I have it! Sarde, Sarde, Sarde... Charles Sarde! 24 Rue des Tilleuls! Come on. Wait! What if she comes back? I decide if and when. That takes no account of desire. You owe me a kiss, for agreeing to help. A deal is a deal. But now the debt has been cleared, we can move on to more sincere physical contact. Let's go to Sarde's. Look where it's got us! It's only been a day and the police are here. This girl has to leave before the Sorbonne is ruined! The police are filth. They have no business here. She's presumed innocent! Let's vote. Does Victoire Missonnier go or not? -Who's in favor? -I am! Lieuret. Go ahead. Do you know Prof. Sarde? Why are you doing this? You're unwelcome at the Sorbonne and it'll come to nothing. Women can't practice law. My father taught me never to say never. After these events and the warrant for your arrest, why not just gather your belongings and disappear? Do you know what it took just to study alongside you? All the refusals and insults. I won't back down now. What did he have you studying? What were his main interests? Criminal law. The rights of the oppressed. Yes, obviously. He was a superb teacher, interesting and passionate. He spoke intensely, to bring the cases to life. And Prof. Sarde encouraged participation. His questions were constructive. OK, we get the picture. What are you doing studying law? Wasting my time. My father teaches here, so I got in automatically. -Isn't that disgraceful? -You don't seem that glad. Nor is he. Since my mother died, he can't stand the sight of me. She died when I was two, so he's been hating me for a while now. He'd never admit it. He's much too polite. But you don't have to be a psychologist to see it. Hence your poor performance. His love is beyond my reach. If I can't have his affection, at least I can put him to shame. And do you know where he lived, who he saw or...? -Maybe there's... -Yes? -Well? -Nothing. Speak or I'll fail you! There was one exception. Someone in whom he confided more intimately. Are the rumors true? Was Prof. Sarde a woman? -No one's perfect. -You see! One woman, then two. We must kick them out, before more damage is done. We can't accept them! Be quiet! Be quiet! Now, who was this friend with whom Sarde spent time? It was the dean. Hello, madame. We were sent here by Charles Sarde. He'll be tied up for a few days and he asked us to fetch some clothes. Are you from his family? You have an eagle's eye, dear lady. Charles is a distant cousin. My father is his mother's uncle, by marriage, through the Sarde-Montpensier branch. He's my favorite resident. He's decent, serious, intelligent and always friendly, but he's ground down by work. Sarde's only weakness is the fairer sex. That doesn't sound like our cousin. He's a teacher. He may well be, but he's morally dissolute. Many times I saw veiled women coming from his rooms. Never the same one twice. And sometimes there were two or three women in one night. It was always on a Friday. Sometimes there were four or five of them! The colonel must be mistaken. Perhaps the anisette is making you see triple, Colonel. I asked you to watch Miss Missonnier. Perfect. Thank you so much. -You asked me to accompany you. -Mrs. Joseph! Look, do you see this button? Yes, the cloth is torn. But I have no more buttons. That's a shame. I'm very fond of this vest. Give it to me. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Victoire Missonnier, why won't men let us study law? Why are they so nasty? Look. Look. Try one on. Listen to this. -"You broke my heart, Odette." -Odette? "Your schemes are over now. I know now that you didn't love me. You used my love to your own ends." It's signed Gustave Vinson. The librarian! -Sir! -Sir, we've found good... I told you to stay here. We used the time well. She was seeing women. Several, up to four a week, every Friday evening. We're not sure, but it would seem... Stop, stop! One at a time, slowly and clearly. Sarde's name was Odette. Someone saw a number of women leaving her rooms. We found a letter. So, the librarian... Gustave Vinson. And the... Here's a pencil. What about the dean? A student often saw them together, in his office. Tantalizingly, he was Sarde's only confidante. There's more. We saw Mrs. Joseph searching the dean's office. Tidying up his office, you mean. No, she stole something. We have a good lead here and you're wasting time on Mrs. Joseph. Mrs. Joseph has a key. She can do what she likes! That's all. Now leave. What? Nothing. Gustave Vinson killed his ex-lover, in a fit of pique. What was the scheme that Vinson referred to? Teaching at the university? Accessing the library? What for? Honestly, who'd want to go to a library? Stop acting the fool. Focus, Marcellin. We need the librarian to talk. -Sir! -Hm? The magistrate's arrest warrant. It's faultless. Very good. We've got her now. Four of you, come with me. I met Odette Sarde by chance, before I saw that she was trying to use me. To get into the Sorbonne? No, into the library. She stole my key, while I was asleep. That was the end of it. It was two years ago. But she swore she'd come back to the Sorbonne, in style. Did you know she cross-dressed? No. I needed time to realize she had come back as a lawyer. It was unthinkable. I understand. When you realized, you must have been furious. I didn't want to lose my job. So, I threatened to tell the dean. Good. We always need informants. And? She just laughed. She said the dean got her into the Sorbonne. And you felt betrayed and humiliated. You decided to do away with her. I swear, it wasn't me. Just ask the dean. I was with him when it happened. Now leave me in peace. Vinson and the dean are as thick as thieves. But why did the dean keep quiet about Odette's new identity? Was she his mistress? Maybe she knew something and was blackmailing him. And so he had her killed. But what was the blackmail? Or maybe he was seeing Mrs. Joseph? Sir, did Mrs. Joseph...? Yes, Marcellin? Mrs. Joseph is quite charming, but she has a penchant for... What makes you say that? She likes cyanide. The bonds of marriage, less so. Was she the poisoner you defended? She was acquitted. Period. It's time. See if they've arrived. If they have, then obstruct them. Go on, do it. HE IS THE RABBLE! Get that down! Hello, Inspector. Could you tell me the time? Ah, the clock says six o'clock. And what's the weather like, around your way? -Come on. -Watch out, your lace is undone. No, you don't have any. It's mine. Marcellin, help our friend to form a solid blockade. Go on. Gentlemen, it was a pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. What a fool. Mrs. Joseph killed her husband, so maybe... No, it wasn't Mrs. Joseph. I'm more inclined to think it was the dean. He sent you into the library. That's true. And then he walked in on me. Inspector Levallois, my father sends his regards. -Who is he? -The president of the Parisian bar. He thinks very highly of you. Really? They're here! What do we do? He loved the way that you faced down to the prefect. Yes, I was a little bit... You were outstanding. Send him my best wishes. Good day to you. You can hide at my home. It's at 20 Rue Thérèse. Get a move on! -They're coming! This way. -No, follow me. Come on, quickly. Where is Victoire Missonnier? One moment, Inspector. Pay close attention to article 9 of paragraph 5 of the penal code: "In no circumstances may ius privatum be applied." That way. Your little protégée lied, you know. Yes. She had a motive for killing Odette Sarde. Really? And what was that? Jealousy? She wanted to be the only woman at the university? Did she say she has a father? We're not that close. She has a father! Some people risk hanging for less! Did she say that her father has been in prison for the last three years? Did she say who managed her father's tragic unsuccessful defense? Charles Sarde. Yes. So, stop laughing. I'm going to arrest her for murder. I really don't like breaking the law. I'm on a scholarship. I can't mess up. A mistake would send me home. Where's home? In Normandy. We live on a farm. I don't want to be a slaughter man, like my father. I know I tend to play it safe, but I can't afford not to. You don't have to explain. Thank you for taking all these risks. Perhaps you know where she is. Alas, other than God, only she knows. I warn you, Garbot, if I find out you've been lying, you'll never practice law again. You'd be making me the happiest man alive. What would you do? You'd be nothing without this university. Your life would be empty. It's like a tomb. People say that Garbot was a wonderful teacher and a brilliant lawyer. But his wife died ten years ago and he went to pieces. He just mouths the same lectures and hates everyone. He's helping me. I have to tell you something. He doesn't trust you. He asked me to watch you. Ah, I see. I took risks for you and you lied to me. About everything. About your father, -about Charles Sarde. -My father? -Who told you? -Inspector Levallois. Did he mention the warrant? I imagine he said you'll be executed. That will kill my father! You should've told me. Would you have defended a criminal's daughter with a motive to kill? You understood nothing in my class. Or of the practice of law. I defend the guilty. My problem is with lies. You owed me the truth, no more, no less. You're not my confessor. I'm of more use, in this life, at least. You disappoint me. My father was accused of anarchism, four years ago, after a strike. This isn't about your father. You can hide out here tonight, but I don't want to see you again. Go to see him in prison, please. That's all I ask. Tell him I love him. It's me. -What are you doing here? -This changes everything. Yes? -Yes? -I was at the university, tonight. -How did you get in? -I have the key, my dear. I cover the night watchman when he's with his lover. I walked past the dean's office and I heard a groan. I look in at the open door and I saw the dean with Mrs. Joseph. -They're lovers. -No. -She was preparing his opium. -So that's it! That's how Odette Sarde was blackmailing the dean. That's why he killed her. Or it was Mrs. Joseph. Or it was both of them. The dean kept you in his office while Mrs. Joseph killed Sarde. What's the plan? Opium is a sedative. The dean will still be in his office. So? I have to catch him red-handed. We can't take such a stupid risk. -Let's call the police. -What? They're after me. I'll go. You stay. What if they won't come? It'll be too late. -You used to be braver. -I wasn't so attached. Trust me. Stay here. I promise. It's here and now. Off you go. What's she up to now? Thanks for telling us. The dean had just telegraphed, asking to see me. He said he had documents proving our young friend's guilt. I think we have a motive this time. Someone's plotting against me! I'm the first woman here and I've been framed for two murders. If it hadn't been for you, we could've avoided the second. Let that be heard. Take her away. Come on. No, I don't want to go. Stop! Go on. Go on. What a story! No! What happened? Where's Victoire? Did she really kill the dean? I'm afraid so. I was two minutes too late. Then you didn't see her do it. You said you swear by the facts. -Who taught you such insolence? -You did. Help her, or she'll be guillotined. I've washed my hands. What were you doing? I told you to wait! Did you come to lecture? I leave you for an hour and there's another body! Do you think I'm guilty? Of course not. -Will Garbot help me? -No. There's no hope. He's furious. What's the plan? I was thinking we could organize an escape. No, I'll clear my name. Don't look at me like that. I can't spend my life on the run. I can't abandon my father. I've requested bail. What? Article 175 prohibits my detention in custody. With no other suspects, there's no risk of consultation and the victims are dead, so I can't intimidate them. I won't have to stay here until my trial. I submitted the letter. It's my only hope. I made you some tea. Drink it while it's hot. Thank you. Murderers are uninteresting. Their crimes lack charm and intelligence. Know your victim and you'll find your killer. Why did this woman risk so much? What did she want? Prof. Sarde is in the library. She stole my key. We must question those that knew Charles Sarde, to find out what she wanted. You have a visitor. The magistrate sent a letter for you. "...as a result of which, you shall be imprisoned until..." Bad news, it seems. Rest assured, you won't feel a thing. It happens so fast. In the basket, the heads... My own grandfather was guillotined. Rightly so. I'm glad it was painless. I'll leave you to consider life's transience. There's always a detail, a point of procedure that wasn't respected. Find it and slip through that breach. "That which votes..." Wait! Look here. It says "votes" instead of "voids". There's a spelling mistake. That invalidates it. There's always a detail. That's the secret. Garbot taught you well. Enjoy your freedom. You'll be back here in a matter of days. And a few days after that, you'll be for the chop. Excuse me. I hate these lawyers! They put criminals on the streets, over nothing! She's committed two murders. We can't leave her at large. What do we do? Stay on her tail. Day and night. There'll be no third murder. Allow me to introduce myself. César Garbot. I was Victoire's lawyer. I came because there's a lot weighing against your daughter. My daughter is innocent. Prisons are full of innocent people, including you, I assume. I was charged with distributing pamphlets. I backed the strike, but I didn't do that. For the sake of my child. Her mother died, so she needed a father. So, you were charged, you needed a lawyer... I had no money and no one wanted to help. Except Sarde. Am I right? Victoire's singing teacher recommended him. He agreed to defend you, but it went badly, because here you are in prison. The hearing went well. I thought I'd been saved. But then the judge looked at Charles Sarde and said he reminded him of someone and that he never forgot a face. Charles Sarde turned white. The next day he didn't come to court and I got ten years. You and your daughter must have been furious. She kept saying she wanted to wring his neck. Thank you, Mr. Missonnier. Wait. Wait. Sarde helped Victoire to study. We received a letter. Sarde apologized and expressed his deep regret. He said he'd help, in any way. -To appeal the case? -Anything but that. But Victoire leapt at the chance. The dean had turned her down. She asked Sarde to provide a reference, which he did. She had no reason to kill him. Please, don't let her down. She's been so successful. She's broken down the barriers, one by one. You can't imagine the determination it took. If you knew how often she came home in tears. But she got back up. She kept fighting. She's almost there now. Are we going to shut her out? What's that? Victoire's father's case. That archivist is fierce! The court's secrets are safe, but I'm faster than he is. You're going to the dogs. Mixing with young people can damage your mental health. OK, let's go. There are 2,000 pages on the anarchist revolt. We need to filet all of that. I want to know all about the trial. Let's get to it. Marcellin, get some food. We'll be here all night. We must speak to everyone that knew Sarde, to know what she wanted. What was she doing in the library? What was she reading? -Victoire. -You scared me! You scared me too. I can't stop thinking of you. You've worked your way into my head. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I told you that I'd get out. How did you find me? Destiny put you in my pathway. Will you bring coffee? Arthur, is that you? -Victoire? -François! Are you hurt? I'm sorry. Are you OK? -What happened? -No idea. -I was attacked. -By whom? I didn't see who it was. Wait. You'll be OK. Victoire? Professor! -What are you doing here? -I found the procedural flaw. What's this? -She was attacked. -Luckily, he scared him off. Why were you at the library? Where were you? Yes, what were you doing at the library? We spent the night on your father's case. I was stretching my legs. In the library? Yes, in the corridor and... You were there when she was attacked. Stop it. Just calm down. What did you find out about my father? Look, there. That proves your father's innocence. Even though he frequented anarchists, which explains your awful character. The evidence was fake. Why didn't you tell me how you were admitted? You didn't listen. You just judged me. No, you never listen! Never! I was worried. And frightened. -I made progress. -It's unacceptable! I made progress. I scoured the registers and discovered that Sarde was obsessed with The Women's Constitution. What's that? That's the question. We need to know why she wanted it. We could ask a specialist in women's literature. No. No, no. Not my father. Prof. Garbot, nice to meet you. I hear good things about your lectures. Hello, François. And I'm glad my son still has friends. He tends to like himself more than he likes others. Young lady, I'd like to be able to say I'm charmed to find out about you, but I'd be lying. Your reputation precedes you. I fully support you. Usually, when my son comes to visit, he has a request to make. Well, sir, your son, who brings a lot of curiosity to my lectures, is interested in a book called The Women's Constitution. -We'd like to know more. -The Women's Constitution. That's interesting. That manuscript was left by a group of militant women that took up arms in the 1848 revolution and called for a women's political constitution and the right to work in all sectors, public, civil, military and religious. -They were daring. -Or demented. That's not all. They also called for compulsory military or religious service for women. Female soldiers and priests -would be so inspiring. -I wouldn't go that far. Are you interested in this book, son? Allow me a degree of surprise. It's lost. We simply want to recover it. You never will. It was stolen. Mysteriously, many works by women have disappeared from the library. I was right. The answer is in the library. The disappearances started when Sarde came to the Sorbonne. Did she come to steal books? Or to set up a library of women's writing. Or to use those books to set up a suffragettes' republic. And she had allies in the women that visited Vauquer's lodgings. Then let's go. The colonel said they met on Fridays. Look at that fellow. It's that policeman. Let's have some fun. That way, Professor. François, follow him. Come on. This way. Mind out. Sir? While you're here, tell me about my suit. It feels tight, but it shows my curves. I'm not sure if the colors... Out of my way! Go that way. Good day, madame. My cousin sends his regards. This is his father. My son speaks very highly of you, madame. And he asked me to give you this. Sorry, I was forgetting... And this. My niece would like to stay. I'll be here until ten o'clock, but don't worry, I'll be gone before night. Sorry. I also forgot this. You are truly your son's father, sir. You know how to address women. -So, a man that knows how... -Victoire. Follow me. Mrs. Perotin, this is Prof. César Garbot. I'm Victoire Missonnier. Do you remember me? Yes, Victoire Missonnier. You had no talent for music but you were very stubborn. That's her. What are you doing here? I'd ask the same of you. We came to see Odette Sarde. -She's dead. -What? She was murdered, in the Sorbonne library. Why? By whom? That's what we'd like to know, so we need your help. You recommended Sarde to my father. How did you meet? It was long ago, at school. As women, we believed you obtain more with a bayonet than with a pretty smile. We hit it off. WOMEN UNITE! THROW OFF YOUR CORSETS! THEY SHACKLE OUR BODIES AND FREEDOM. Hello, Odette. Sorry we're late. We set up a group, to salvage books. The Women's Constitution? Yes, and other women's books that were being lost at the Sorbonne. There were rumors of meetings where books were burned. Can you imagine such barbarism? But theft is worse, isn't it? If you start burning books, you'll end up burning people. Was Odette Sarde willing to risk her life for that? She had a personal objection. Her mother wrote that constitution. Odette couldn't tolerate the idea of that book's disappearance. She would have risked anything. Someone must have known about the burnings. -Mrs. Joseph must have known. -Don't start that! What is it about Mrs. Joseph? Are you hiding something? Don't talk nonsense. -She knows the Sorbonne so well. -She wasn't involved. How do you know? She's a poisoner. No, she is not. I defended her, so I'd know. She was accused of poisoning her husband and the two before him. Three? Wrongly, I hope. You're obsessed with details. One? Three? I forget. Who cares? Come on, hurry up! She had killed before. And the dean must've told her a lot. Maybe she was jealous. I can vouch for her. I got her her job. You gave a poisoner the keys to the Sorbonne? What about rehabilitation? She'd stood trial. I can't stand double jeopardy. Under the Terror, you'd have guillotined people. You'd let serial killers go free. -I was almost killed! -It wasn't her. -It was. -She had an alibi. What alibi? I'm her alibi. Is that enough for you? You were with Mrs. Joseph? -Why not? -Yes. You lost her? -Did you look everywhere? -Yes, sir. -At Garbot's? -The house was empty. That doesn't surprise me. Defending a criminal is good for his pride, but taking the risk of hiding her is quite different. He'd have to like her and he hasn't liked anyone for some time. And someone tried to kill Victoire Missonnier last night. What? -Who? -I didn't see. Really... I saw her at Garbot's office, with a bloody shoulder. What are you still doing here? Scour Paris. Find that girl for me. And not dead! Alive. Mrs. Joseph, we'd like to discuss the strange events surrounding Odette Sarde's death. Stranger than a woman dressed up as a man? In this degenerate world, with women wanting to study law, it's not surprising things end in murder. You know a thing or two about that. Maybe I do. Beyond those details, we'd like to know if you've heard anything about book burnings. Maybe. Mrs. Joseph, it's vital that you tell us a bit more. We don't want to mention the opium to the inspector. All I can say is that this morning I found this in a student's bag. It was sticking out. It's by Louise Labé. I was looking for that. And these pamphlets. I took some. "We must fight this female invasion, or be submerged. Women will be our masters, rather than our mistresses." What's this? It looks like a fraternity badge. A fraternity with strange rites. I wouldn't know. Fraternities used to be boys from good families, who'd drink and put the world to rights. Now they're hotheads that burn books. Could you give us the student's name? No, I was just cleaning up, in a break in Prof. Choiseul's class. There were lots of bags. Thank you, Mrs. Joseph. As always, your opinion has been very enlightening. A grade of zero will be given to anyone that refuses to tell me about this fraternity. Mr. Duplessis? Zero. Mr. Birotteau? Zero. It seems that not many of you will be passing the year. That's a shame. It's the St. Nicolas fraternity. It started as boys in search of fun. But a woman in the law faculty and two studying medicine changed everything. Meaning? Following the dean's theories, they opposed women's admission to universities. They attack those that support women. No one dares oppose them. You'll have to make contact with the members of the fraternity. You boys will have more luck than me. It won't be easy. They'll be suspicious. I'll do it. I'll tour the local cafés. Thanks. Anything for you. Don't just stand there, François. Go on. Yes, OK. So, you chose Arthur. I like him. I understand. But I feel bad for François, because I think I was a François, myself. One of the nice boys, that the girls overlook, in search of the dashing idlers. He is dashing. Yes, but to start a family... Who said that's what I want? Why wouldn't you? It's just like you and Mrs. Joseph. It's nothing like that. For a start, I'm... You're a man and I'm a woman? Exactly. And a woman... Belongs to her husband, according to the law. What's wrong with that? Don't overbid your conservatism. Stop making yourself hateful. It won't work with me. Checkmate. OK, gentlemen, let's start over. But let's ask whether this whole affair could have been a giant hoax. Maybe someone used this girl, before trying to get rid of her. But if you had this all wrong... What can I tell you? The prefect would fire me. But I'd have a clear conscience. François. OK? I searched the cafés. François was right. I couldn't get close to them. Really? I overheard a conversation between two fraternity members. No one notices you if you're shy. There's a meeting tonight. They'll be at Momus, first. We just need to follow them. No, no... I forbid you from undertaking such a risky plan. Unless I'm mistaken, they've killed two people already. Let's not walk into the wolf's mouth. You're usually much more sensible, François. We must tell the police. The policemen that locked me up and refused to question the dean? Didn't you hear? -They could be murderers. -The fraternity is our only lead. Victoire, everything you do makes your case worse. Are you aware of that? This could prove my innocence. If you won't go, then I'll go on my own. François! I'll talk to her. Victoire! This is ridiculous. You can't go. -I'll go. -We both will. We'll all go. I'm risking death. It's much too dangerous. You should've listened last time. -Take me. -I can't. You're a woman. François, what are you doing? OK. -I'll pick you up at eleven o'clock. -No. No, five to midnight, on Rue Thénard. What's your game? You jump at your own shadow. She's not a child. She can decide what she wants. But they're dangerous. Are you going to defend her with those shoulders and your angelic face? What will you fight them with? Excuse me, darling, do have you a match? Victoire? How do I look? I wouldn't want to kiss a mustache, but... I'd like to know. So, you came. Did François chicken out? No, François is going to come. I wanted to be here first. Something's up. His behavior's changed. Why did he insist on coming? Usually, he's so nervous. And he was there just after your attack. How did he know you were there? I searched his things. I found these pamphlets. They're the same as Mrs. Joseph's. And a cape. I tore this off. The badge is the same. François is fooling us. He's a member of the fraternity. Don't go. Don't follow them. It's them. No, Victoire, it's too dangerous. Victoire. Come away with me. We'll go tonight. We'll go to China or to Italy. Quick, they're going. Where is she? They must've gone to the fraternity meeting. They? She chose Arthur over me. That's just the way it is. Arthur? How did they go? What do you mean? You saw two students. Yes, they followed them. But you saw them. How did Arthur recognize them? He couldn't. I don't know. He couldn't know. Unless he already knew them. We've been fooled, all along. We have to catch them. No, wait. Let's get the police. Run, fast! How do I find you again? I'll leave some pointers. Get going! There, we've seen them. Now let's go. No. Let's try to join up. What? They'll kill you if they see you're a woman! We need to see their faces! Victoire, I love you. Come with me. Garbot has already gone. Follow me. Arthur? Who's this? You may be the leader, but you can't bring anyone you like. Let me go! You should've gone when I said. Let me go! Calm down. It's Victoire Missonnier! He's lost control. -She's seen us. -We have to eliminate her. -Let me go. -Hang her, as an example. Women have to see we don't want them. It's this way. Come on. Arthur... -You're wrong. -You're abandoning me. Take her. Take her! Let me go! Let me go! Pull! No, let me go, please! Untie her, immediately! Are you all crazy? You'll regret this, forever. This isn't about your ideas. It's about your mother, who left you, and your father, who despises you. No, no! Those traitors will be punished! You know the rules. The cause demands unity! Let's burn the last copy of The Women's Constitution. Let's cut them off from knowledge! Arthur, stop, please. Let me go. -Hang her. -No. -Are you OK? -Yes. That's good, Rivolier. Take him away. Don't move. We'll bring help. It'll be OK, Victoire. SIX MONTHS LATER... -OK? -Yes. -Hello, sir. -Do you remember my father? Of course. What's wrong? Has someone died? I'm here today to congratulate the laureates. I invite to the rostrum the top student of the year, just ahead of Mr. François Lieuret, Miss Victoire Missonnier. I'd like her to speak to us about her trajectory and ambitions. Victoire... I have decided to become a lawyer. A lawyer for the voiceless, for the poor, for the forgotten, such as my father, whose name was cleared by Prof. César Garbot. Odette Sarde taught me that one can die for one's ideas, that beyond our personal battles lies a greater struggle, a collective struggle, to build a better world. Women still don't have the right to litigate in court, but one day they will. I managed to gain admission to Paris's great university. And I will break down the doors of Paris's bar. That exception will be made for me - for us - one day soon. I'm certain of it. Centuries of culture look upon us at this university. Centuries of male culture. Make sure that the coming centuries belong to you too. I hope they're all as good as you. So, do I still look like an undertaker? Yes. An undertaker in a pink vest. Subtitling: Hiventy
