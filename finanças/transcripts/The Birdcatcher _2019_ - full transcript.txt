One day they were suddenly there like a flock of crows. They said nothing would change for the worse, things would only get better. The first of many lies they told us. The first of many we had to tell ourselves. "The raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements. The raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements. Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts. Unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe, top-full of direst cruelty! And make... Make... make thick my blood." I never remember that line. I have to be word perfect for the audition on Monday. Was I believable at least? Come, Billy. How do I look? Hey, are you feeling better? Oh, you look terrible. Oh, Mama, be gentle. Isn't that mine? I wanted to feel close to you, it helps me get better. What have you been doing today? I practiced my lines a little. So it was that, huh? You're not sick at all, are you? Hmm? Have a listen to the radio. Come on. Okay, help me. Outside of love, everything else seems to be a waste of time. Esther! You idiot, you'll break the window. Come down, then. Oh, there you are, if you see Ola in town, tell him to come back. You remember my Ola... he is not coming back. Sure he will. You're so kind... I don't even remember your name. It's Esther, Esther Albertsen. Esther, like the queen in the Bible. Yes. Would you like to come and play cards with me? I'm sorry, I really can't right now, Mrs. Jensen. Ola. I'll come back tomorrow. Where shall we go? Papa says they closed the cinema. Let's go to the fjord, they can't close that. Where did you get the cigarette? I found it on the ground. Shh, Germans. Good as new, do you want a puff? That's been in someone's mouth. That cigarette was smoked by an honest Norwegian. In America you can buy cigarettes in the streets. But we're not in America. Papa says we're going there. So you can be a movie star. What are you staring at? Nothing, I am... I have to help Papa. Come. I thought you said you were late, hurry up, then. Hmm, very nice. - Very nice. - Thank you. As ever, Hans. Very nice. Mm-hmm. Thank you, Mrs. Henie. Thank you, Hans. See you next month. Yes, indeed. I'll deliver the wig for you. Take it to the theater director, Mr. Gleditsch. Goodbye, Mrs. Henie. - Thank you, bye. - Goodbye. Afternoon. - Hans, how are you? - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you too. - Come in, welcome. Esther, are you encouraging my son to smoke? - Of course not. - Hmm? I told him it's disgusting. Just kidding. Yes... how's your day? You have to be careful, Hans, they're arresting Jews in Telvag, you should leave. Hmm, I love my life, my family, my work. You know, there's a curfew now. I spend my life in here listening to idol gossip, it's just talk. That's what they said in Telvag. It's all right, I'll be fine. And besides, we have tickets for America. There you are. All right, thank you. You're welcome. Don't dawdle, sweetheart, Mr. Gleditsch needs that today. Attention, all citizens of Trondheim. By order of District Commander Terboven, civil marshall law is declared in the municipalities of Trondheim, Langstrad, Stranda, Byneset, and the entire county of Nord Trondenlag. "Is this a dagger I see before me? Handle toward my hand? come let me clutch thee: I have thee not, and yet I see." So, are you excited about the premiere tonight? Of course. Let's just start doing my, uh, Wild Duck monologue, - starting with your line, please. - Okay. I suppose she dived to the bottom, then. Wild ducks do, they shoot to the bottom, as deep as they can get, and trap themselves. Fast in the tangle and seaweed, and all of the devils own mess that grows down there. And they never come up again. And what is this all about, Sir? - Henry Gleditsch? - Yes. Unfortunately, the premier is sold out but I'm sure I can get you, how many? One, two, three... 10 prominent residents of the area have been executed at 6PM this evening at Falstad Concentration Camp. Those executed were from Trondheim: Attorney, Otto Skirstad; Editor, Harold Langeller; and Theater Director, Henry Gleditsch. Hey, aren't you going to eat? Hans... you need to talk to her. It's not safe for her to be on the streets anymore, not with her daydreaming and... She is safe. Besides, she will be running the shop before you know it. Yes, Papa. Queen of Spades. You're not cheating, are you? Hmm, you look like an innocent flower but you're a serpent underneath. I told you playing would make you feel better. Huh? What are you doing? Sorry, Sir. Vladimir Abramovitz. Yes. Then, why does your doorplate read Hans Albertsen? I'm Norwegian, I was born here. No, you're a Jew. - What are you doing? - Stop, Esther. Papa. Esther, don't worry. - Papa will be back, darling. - Of course, how else will the Nazi's keep their hair trimmed. No, no. Tor. - Rebecca! - Hans! Rebecca! Esther. Why didn't you help Papa? Sometimes you have to pretend to survive. Here, give this to your mother. Tor! - Please. - Tor! Who is there? - Esther, hurry up. - Yes, Mama. Come on, Billy, we have to go. - Okay, good luck, good luck. - Thank you. Hey, Esther, come down,. Shh, quiet. - The bird stays here. - No, please. - It stays here. - Please. Let me at least set him free. Be quiet, shh. And stay hidden until you're out of the city, all right? For the movies. - Halt! - Halt! Get out, now! - I'm scared. - Get in. Off you get, all of you. - Hurry up! - move, move! - Move! - Don't touch me! Stop talking! You must be brave, Esther. Mama. No, no! Papa! I saw someone. Not now, son. But I saw someone in the woods. Hey! Didn't you hear him? Not now! I found something. - Yeah, what, your brain? - Leave him alone! What's the matter with you, you can't take a joke? - Let me help you. - Why couldn't you give him a real boy? - Hey, enough! - Stupid. Enough, enough! Over there. Herr. Krause, - nice to see you again. - Johann. I hope your mission was a success. No, one escaped, a Jewish girl. Boy! Help with the suitcases. - Here. - Thank you. No! No! Mama. Mama. No, no, Mama. Anyone can follow your tracks. Who are these people? If you stay out here any longer, you'll freeze to death. Who are you? I knew you were. The only kind Papa hates more than the British. Do you realize what trouble we could get into? They're boy's clothes, but they'll have to do. No, no, go ahead. What are they doing here? They stay overnight sometimes. - Patrols. - For what? For people like you. But don't worry, they never come through here. I've watched them before, it's safe. Look, look. See? Men being women. And dancing. They're ridiculous. Boy, Aksel! Come down here! That's my father. Where are you? Just be quiet, then you'll be safe. Are we having a party or not? Cheers. To Norway. How long have you been here? They're still looking for you. Hey, who are you talking to up there? No one. I don't believe you, boy. There's no one here. You're lying. What are you hiding? Is he dead? Get help. Ma! Ma! Fred, Fred, Fred! - He was drunk again, Mama. - What the hell happened? He slipped, Aksel found him here. Let's get him inside, help me, Aksel. - Aksel! - Hey. What's the matter with you, boy? Let him be. Let him be. "This is the very painting of your fear, this is the air-drawn dagger which you said led you to Duncan. Oh, these flaws and starts, impostors to true fear would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire, authorized by her grandma. Shame itself!" What are you doing out here, boy? I need help. Hey, look at me. - How did you get here? - I'm lost. You know this one? No. All right, get him in the car. Go. Take off your hat. Oh, for Christ sake. Where did you find him? He found us. Lept in front of the car like he had a death wish. I thought it was an ambush. Go to your room, boy. So... what happened to you? I lost my parents. Speak up, boy! How? They were killed. - We told you to speak up. - Fred! - By whom? - Bombers, the British. Don't I always say that? Bastards, what's your name? Ola. Ola Jensen. And you have no one? My grandmother lives in Trondheim, but she's senile. - So, we're settled. - Yeah. Send him back to Trondheim. We could use extra hands, Pa. It's also an extra mouth to feed. Didn't I tell you to go to your room? He's right, Johann, you'll be busy with the election and Fred can't work. Will you be quiet? It's not a decision for women and children. Well, maybe. Maybe she's right, - Johann. - Oh, come on. Of course. There's a lot of work to do, and your farm is very important to us. And after all, what possible harm could a young boy do? Listen... gonna work hard and help this good man in exchange for his hospitality. Good. All right, try it. Shut the door! What happened, your hair? It's easier this way, if the world thinks I'm a boy. So, what's plaguing my pig? I've been trying to fatten it up for election dinner, but the damn thing is wasting away. It's not a virus, or hoof and mouth. How can you be sure? He told me. There's no blisters on his feet or mouth, no fever. Where did you train? A healthy pig loves to eat, so I would monitor his appetite. Do you have eggs, milk, molasses? Put that in his pig feed, that will get him eating again. And I'll come back in a week and check on him. If he keeps being sick, it's not worth it's hide. Isn't there a real vet I can talk to? Have you got a name? You've got nice dark eyes, like Humphrey Bogart. My Mama loved him. Can I call you Bogey? Are you just pretending to be sick so they can't serve you for dinner? That's very smart, Bogey. Very smart. This way, watch your step. We can't keep doing this, it's too dangerous. More dangerous if we stop. Why? I would lose my mind. Hold on, here. Shall I open it now? Later. I'll have to leave again, today. But when I'm back, let's go somewhere where we can't be seen. I need to know this is real. Do you need any help, Mrs. Dalgaard? I didn't know you were there. May I help you? How did you learn to do that? My Mama taught me. She was just like you. Very good mother. There's a blizzard coming. We'll need to stay warm. Why isn't dinner ready? - I'm sorry. - What have you been doing all day, woman? We'll be five tonight. Five? What use is this boy? Use? I'll tell you what use, did you do your chores today? - Yes, Sir. - You see, Fred? He did more today than you did in a week, and he drinks less. Lucky for you, my brother, you wouldn't be living here. Lucky? And nobody else would have you either. You're useless. I think Aksel was right for a change. I might have found somebody I can rely on. We'll make a bed for you upstairs later. Thank you. What are you staring at, Fred? Go do something useful. - Good night. - Night. I love you. I'm not a child anymore. - Good night, Ola. - Good night. This weather can last for weeks. Have you ever made a snow angel? Try. Mine looks more like a bird that's been winged. What do you want to be when you grow up? An actress. Papa promised we'd move to America. America? What's your Papa like? He's wonderful. And he gives the best haircut in the whole of Trondheim. Does he love you? Of course. What's the city like? It's beautiful. Well... it was until the Germans came. Maybe one day when they're gone... I can move to the city with you. I could help you act in your films. Me, you and your Papa together. Maybe. Maybe one day. "What beast was't, then, that made you break this enterprise to me? When you durst do it, then you were a man; and to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place did then adhere, yet you would make both. They have made themselves, and that their fitness now does unmake you. I have given suck, and know how tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me. I would, while it was smiling in my face, have plucked my nipples from his boneless gums and dashed the brains out, had I so sworn as you have done to this." Good. I'm going to Trondheim, my interview with the National Party, represent the district. It's an honor. Not that anyone here seems to care. I think that's wonderful. Fred and I will be away a few days, I want you to keep an eye on the farm. Better that men are in charge, right, Ola? That's good, then. I thought I'd pay your grandmother a visit, do you want me to pass her a message? Yes. Tell her I'm fine, Ola is really fine. Fred! We're leaving! Hello, Ola, come join us. Help yourself. I thought I might go out somewhere tonight, the cinema perhaps. Can me and Aksel come? Please, Mama. - I'm not sure if... - Please, please. All right. How will we get there? I thought Herr. Krause might take us. Why would Herr. Krause bother to do that? Maybe to show his gratitude for our hospitality. But what will people say, Mama? What do we care what people say? Okay? The cinema's in Flornes, so from here I reckon it can't be more than six hours to the Swedish border. My Mama told me there's a safe house there. I saw the German's map. If your Pa pays Mrs. Jensen a visit, I need to be gone before he gets back. Can't you just get the train? I don't have any papers, you dummy, and you know what I am. Can I come with you? - What do you mean? - I want to come with you. - You want to help me? - Yes. Yes, you can come with me. We have to go. It's fantastic. We have to go now. No, later. Aksel, no, now. Are you ready, Ola? Ola, let's go, the car's waiting. Herr. Krause. Was it nice, the movie? Yeah. You were right, the cinema is amazing. Thank you for taking us. It means a lot. How did you enjoy the film? I loved the dancers. What's wrong? I'm sorry, what else do you want me to say? Being sorry doesn't solve anything. We had a plan but now we're stuck here. - Stop. - You idiot! Stop, please. Why are you doing this? What's going on? What's going on here? Hey. what are you doing? Please just let me go, please. You're a girl. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, just let me go, please. Why are you hiding? Because I'm a Jew. Does Aksel know? Uh-huh. And he's been helping you? Don't hate him. Hate him? - Go to your room. - Don't tell anyone, please. Go back to your room. You can't, just let me go. I won't tell anyone about you and Herman, please. You can't go, my husband will get suspicious. - Please? - Go back to your room. I didn't think I'd find you here, Herr. Krause. Yeah, kind of like it up here. Come on, are you good? Good, good. Boy, help Fred with the suitcases. Ola, I need to talk to you. How was your trip? I was nominated. That's wonderful. I met Mrs. Jensen. Well... don't you want to know what she had to say? She was happy to hear that you were doing well, and she kept asking when you'd be coming back. - What did you tell her? - I told her I need you here. I brought you something. Open it. Well, what do you have to say? Mr. Dalgaard, that's too kind. Well, try it on. I couldn't... I mean, I... I'd like to save it for a special occasion. There'll be plenty of those. One to scatter, two to kill. Lucky shot, Herr. Krause. When I aim at something I very rarely miss. - Nice shot. - Thank you. I love this country. Let's see what you're made of. Come on, boy. - Oh! - No, oh! Never point a loaded gun unless you mean to kill. Here, I'll show you. Up on the shoulder, foot forward, that's it. There, ready. Well, yeah! Well done, Ola! Lucky shot, boy. Papa, can I try? It takes two strong hands, son, go get the winnings. Another one. Everyone has a limp now and then. It's one thing to have a limp... it's another to be ugly. You are not ugly. Do it again. Chin up and straighten your arm a little bit. Try. It's good. What does it mean? It means... a lot. What did you do? Oh, I didn't do anything. Ola has been looking after him. Ola is an animal charmer, too. Aksel helped, we brought him food and kept him warm. It turned out good, didn't it, Pa? He's a fine animal. We knew she was right, it was egg and milk that did it. No, no! You're not crying, are you? No. Here... this is for you. You see? Good things often come from ugliness. Thank you, Mr. Dalgaard. Listen, don't forget to put your blinds down at night. The Germans fear the British planes will see the light, they might drop their bombs on us. Well, try it, Ola. Do you like it here, Ola? I can only imagine it can get lonely sometimes... away from the family. It's fine. Mr. Dalgaard, are you all right? It will be Christmas soon. Yeah. What's wrong? Are you ill? I'm not pretending anymore. We have to. Come here, come here. When I was Aksel's age, I was given the privilege of cutting the Christmas tree. That's no small honor. My father's ax, and his father's before him... from man to man. I think you can handle it, Ola. I'll go find a tree worthy of our traditions. I'm so sorry, Aksel, but you know what this means, don't you? Aksel. I'm going to prove my father wrong. What if we just kept going? It's all right. I'll get you home. You're going to be all right. Okay. Help, help! Help, help! - What happened? - He cut himself. What happened? He cut himself. Why the hell did you give him the ax? Shut up, Fred! Help me up, we need to get him - to the doctor! - Anna! This is why you can't be trusted with anything. My brave soldier. Just you left now, Ola. Maybe you could give him a quick physical while you're here. Absolutely. Take off your sweater, let him have a look at you. Don't be afraid, the doctor won't hurt you. The good doctor should be allowed to take his leave. It's getting late. All right. - Johann. - Herr. Krause. We caught a smuggler near the border and we have to question him immediately. - Do you have a place? - Who is he? A man from Trondheim, he helped us in the past, but now we know he played both sides. He took me in for quite a while. - All right, Yes, I have a place, this way. - Good. Ola, come along, come down to the sauna. Move. It's down here. Come on, Ola! So, now. You're going to tell me everything we need from the start, do you hear me? Do you hear me? Hey, do you hear me! Hey! Don't fade away! Don't fade away! Stay with me. Reichmann on the radio. This guy is fading away, keep him awake. I'll be back in a second. Ola, Ola. Your turn, Ola. You have a go. Come on. Imagine it's one of the British who killed your parents. Go on, boy. show us what man you are, come on! Just pretend. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, don't kill him. Ola! Ola! Ola! Ola! There's a proper fighter in you. I'm so pleased. That bastard will be dead by morning. Why weren't you in school? - Idiot, you'll break the window! - Come down, then. Stand up. Let me look at you. Yes. Great. It's a very important day, the NS election, everything has to be perfect. Of course. You know... It hasn't been easy here, the last years. This election is vital... for the fate of my farm... and you. One day, all this... can be yours. You're the only one who understands me, Ola. Only you. I was... very poor when I was a kid. Like you. Very poor. Look, Pa, it hurts like fire but I don't care. - I'm getting up. - That's good, son. Idleness will get you in the end. I'm fine. Listen, boy, we're going to have visitors today from the NS Party. I think it might be better if you stay in your room. It's for your own good, son. I understand, Papa. Good. Excellent. Maybe after this election, I'll teach you how to fire that rifle. Herr. Reichmann. Welcome to Dalgaard Farm, an honor. Is this your son, Mr. Dalgaard? Uh, no, no, it's, it's not my blood, but it's a proud member of the Youth Hird, Ola. Frau. Reichmann. Do you believe in the cause? The Fuhrer has, uh, big dreams for the future. He will build a new capital near Trondheim, the Northern Star. Go get Herr. Reichmann's things. So, my brother has prepared a very nice glogg. Please make yourself at home. Welcome. Thank you. - Thank you. - It's so beautiful. Anna, a word. You think I'm a fool, Anna? - You've been drinking... - Shut up! One has to be drunk or mad to be with a woman like you. You disgust me, you hear that? Disgust me. Mrs. Dalgaard? Leave me alone. Wait. Come here. I have to server dinner looking like this. He didn't think of that. Maybe I can help you. I'm good with makeup. Mrs. Dalgaard, you look so beautiful. Maybe you can make me so. Are you all right? What's your real name? Esther. Esther Albertsen. We should go downstairs. Would you do this up for me? It's beautiful, isn't it? Herman gave it to me. Ola! Ola... having a good time? All right, great. Would you like some? Yeah, thank you. There you are, Ola, look at you, all dressed up. My poor brother's little Nazi savior. So, drinking makes a man, Ola. What makes you drunk, makes you bold. Right, Fred? You're a strange boy. One more. Come on. Come on, Ola. One day... all of this will be mine. All of it. Don't think that you can come here and take that away from me. This place, you're welcome to it. So... a toast, to another year of Norwegian pride, and, uh, to our proud German soldiers, who so bravely are fighting the Bolsheviks on the Eastern Front. Heil, Hitler! My wife will now serve the main course. Please help yourself. The war has been good for you, Johann. It was a pig that didn't want to celebrate Christmas. Must have been a Jew. What are you doing, Anna? Make sure Herr. Krause is well fed, Anna. I'm happy the Germans and the Norwegians are getting on so well on your farm. This is a very special place. We try our best, Herr. Krause. It is. So, so, Johann. Let's turn to the real business here. We would like you to be the new NS District Chief, of course. Johann! Well... Before you speak, Johann, about case 43-03. Commandeering of farms for German personnel, do you object to your farm being commandeered? Commandeered? We, we, we already host troops now. But there are many more troops to come. It was my understanding that everyone around here is a 100% collaborative... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's agree, then, come on, come on! Say a few celebratory words. Come on, come. Uh... It's... I'm leaving tonight with Herman and I'm taking Aksel with me. - You can't. - Why? Because he's worse than Mr. Dalgaard. - This belonged to my mother. - What? What's the matter with you? - Fred, where are you? - I'm coming! Johann, thank you for everything. Good bye! Aksel, where are you? What are you doing up here? We have to leave tonight when they're asleep. - Are you coming with me or not? - You don't need me. Yes, I do. I can hardly walk. Get the horse ready. We're going on the sledge. You were meant to help me with Papa... but you replaced me. No, it's not... Yes, it is! It's not safe for you here anymore. Your Mama and Herr. Krause are running away together tonight. What? So everyone is leaving me. Shh, no. Stop it! No, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. What about America and Papa? I need you. Ola! What are you doing? Nothing, Mr. Dalgaard. Are you okay? Come with me. We're going to make a man of you. Go get the sledge. Listen, listen, shh. We're going to make you one of us now. - No, no! - It's just tradition, we've all done it. This is how you become a man! Do you find this amusing, Dalgaard? What kind of operation is going on here? You've made a fool of all of us here! This election is never happening. But the Germans will still commandeer your farm. - Wait, wait, wait. - Come on. - Come on! - I can explain. What have you got to say for yourself? Listen, listen, listen. Tell him, Mr. Dalgaard. I'm a Jew... and he's been hiding me! What? a Jew? No, no. Aksel! Aksel! We need to go. Somebody go and get the water! You! Who are you? Johann. what's going on? Well, if it isn't the happy couple. Johann, you're drunk. Put the gun down. Listen to your wife, put the gun down, let's go inside. - Shut up! - No. You don't tell me what to do! This is my farm. Papa. Aksel, don't. Go on, meet me like a man. - Papa. - Shut up, son, not now. Johann, we are allies, all right? Go on! Shoot them, then! Shoot them! - Shut up, Fred. - Go away, Fred. - You and your little whore! - Shut up, Fred! I already see what's going on here. - Go away. - They've been with each other all the time you were in Trondheim, trying to make something out of you, they were being with each other. - Go away. - That little whore! - Go away or I put one in you. - Don't! - You're such a... - You're a whore! No! Mr. Dalgaard. No! We have to go! We have to go! Go, go! Get on. - More water. - More water. Stop! where are you going? Hey! Where are you going? We're at the lake. We have to cross here to get to Sweden. Do we have to cross the lake? It's the only way left. Is it safe? We'll find out. I told you we'd make it. Outside of love, everything else seems to be a waste of time. No, he's not here anymore. Whore! Traitor! German slut! Thank you, Mrs. Heine. Thank you, Esther. - See you next month. - Yes, indeed. Disgusting. Come in. I hoped I'd find you here. Nazi slut. Wait. Come in. Your father would be horrified. Yes, he would. Please leave and don't come back. I'm sorry. Come. Once upon a time, I became what I pretended to be. Compromised, completely. But when they left, I stopped pretending.
