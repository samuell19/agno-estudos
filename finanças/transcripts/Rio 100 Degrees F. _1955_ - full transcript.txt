RIO, 40 DEGREES Joaquim! I'll get back to lunch oldie... You said you were going to the market for me, why are you breaking a promise? No, I'm won't break it. I just have to talk to a friend. I know the kind of talk you'll have... Booze! Stop annoying me, I told I'll have lunch... You're fooling me! Leave him, mother, I'll go to the market! I've got to buy some things. Bring me some beans. But don't let them mix them with that other brand. I know, I know. Pay attention, girl. You look like you're out of your mind! I know, mother. Don't let them mix the beans. Yeah, because they'll come with some insects. For this price, what did you expect? And rice? Won't you need it? What, are you out of your mind? I just bought 2 bags. Ok, I buy it with my money. I looks like you're putting a party for this Alberto, aren't you? It?s not a party. I just don't want to be out of food when he arrives. - And Valdomiro, is he coming to? - What Valdomiro? She only brings me problems! Zeca! Bring more water, Zeca! Oh, mother, I need to work! - I sold 200 yesterday! - When did you left? Two o'clock! Oh, big deal! I'll bet I sell the same amount until twelve! Sure, sure... You couldn't sell even if we were at Carnival! - Do you wanna bet? - I don't like bets! You talk too much! Give my paper back. Guys, I just had it figured out. Each one of us, has to give 50 bucks. What!? 50!? Are we going to buy a golden ball? - I will only give 20. - Me too. Do you want to buy a lousy ball? I'll cancel the deal! But 50 cruzeiros is a lot of money! Will have to sell a lot of newspapers! 50? I won't give 50! - We didn't agree on that! - You're full of shit... - I will give 30. - That's more like it. Let's go, then. Let's go to Corcovado. It's full of Americans! And what about the sugar loaf? There we can sell it for 2 cruzeiros! He's afraid of walking the trolley and wants the Sugar Loaf! Where is Jorge? Jorge! - Aren't you going? - Wait a while. - Bring me the money for the medicine. - How much, mother? About 80. Look, take the rest of the meat that Mrs. Lourdes gave me. - Aren't you eating? - I will arrange something. God be with you. I'll go to the park, and that's it! Then I'll see if you're bringing the money! Let's go, Paulo! - Where are we going? - I'll go to Corcovado hill. Every man for himself! - Where are you going? - Don't know. Get money for my mother. Can you lend me 3 coins? I'll have to go to Copacabana. I'll give you the money, but you'll have to give me that card. - Do want something else!? - Take it or leave it! Everyone has to bring 30 cruzeiros, this afternoon. - I know. - Let's go! - Where is your sister? - What do you want with her? - Tell me, c'mon! - I won't. Give me some money, first. Later. Tell me or I'll break your arm. Is she at home? No, she isn't. Now give me five bucks. Tell me, quickly! Ok, I'll tell you! - Will you give me the money? - Yes. She went to the market with Vanda. I'm warning you! You better pay me! Hey, looser! You clown! Will you take it? - How much? - It's cheap. Only 20 cruzeiros. Mine is busted. I bought it two weeks ago, and is already busted. This is because you work stepping in grease. I'm glad Alberto is making me a wooden platform. Hey, be careful with Alberto! Valdomiro knows about it. So What? Valdomiro don't pay my bills. Yes, but he made you the queen of the parade! He did it because he wanted. I never had anything to do with him. Tell me something. Who is making gossip about my life? It is not me. I'm not the only worker at the factory. I don't give a damn. Everybody can meet Alberto today, at my place! I want to talk with you. Why are you putting this face? - Don't fool me. - Give me some. Do I owe you something? Say it! I'm warning you! You will be sorry later! Don't tell me what to do! I already have a boss at the factory! Lady... Lady... Won't you pay me? I gave you the money! You will talk to me or I'll do something wrong. - C'mon, show me the money! - Stop robbing me! Look, here's the money, it was among the vegetables. If you want to talk to me, come to the square tonight. If you're with that guy, there will be no time for talking, see? What guy? That one from the factory! That little tramp! - Take that back, you! - Oh, don't pick a fight for that tramp! Let me see the money! C'mon, give it to me. Oh, hell! Haven't I told you to leave those creepy things alone? I'll hit you the next time you grab those creatures. Pick up the money. Stay here! Catarina! Catarina! What is the matter with you, Catarina? Catarina! Catarina! What are you doing here? What is that in your hand? If you come back, I'll really show you something! Today I'm lucky! - I'll give you five, ok? - Do you want to exchange? I'll give you eight, ok? Oh, No! This way I'll be out of the game! - She told me she would be here at nine. - And if she doesn't come? I have to fix this thing or I'll be in trouble. But go quickly, because Rosinha is expecting us for lunch. She told me she has a bottle of wine! Don't you worry, I'll fix in no time! If she wants, she can complain to the Bishop! - How are you? - Everything is ok! - My buddy! - It's a pleasure! I'll meet you around the corner, will you be long? No, I'll be there soon. Hey, stop with this nonsense. What is it? It's I who should be asking you. After you discovered it, you disappeared. I had work all the week long. And today? Why didn't you go to Copacabana? Are you afraid of my brother? I couldn't go and that's it! That's a good one! You are smart, aren't you? You could not harm a fly! I won't talk to you brother! You're asking too much! - I didn't arrange this thing alone! - Then go away, scoundrel! I can work and take care of myself! I can take care of a child! Don't you say that again, or I'll be leaving you! That's it! Go away! You've got what you wanted, hmm? Now you don't need to please me anymore. Let's go, that one is finished... Oh, Rosinha asked for a bottle of booze... - Why did you come back? - Forget it... - Why are you afraid? - You don't have to ask, if you don't care. - C'mon. Smile! - Oh Pedro, I'm afraid! But your brother is not a monster! But his a northern! Let's fix the things for the marriage? It's will be hard for me. I told you, I can't marry you. If I could, I would. - Does your brother knows about it? - He's suspecting something... And if you go and talk to him? - Today? - Yes. You could explain everything to him. We could get married in a month. And where should we live? - Take it easy, we shouldn't hurry things. - You're the one that hurried things. You can't bargain with me! - If you want it, I can sell you! - How much? 10 bucks! Seven! Ten! No more and no less! So give it to me! - Do you have the tiger? - 10 bucks! - Nine! - Nine it's! Look all those Gringos! Let's smoke some American cigarettes! - I don't have any change! - So come back later! They are impossible today! They look like people from the ghetto! - He is playing nice! - Oh... My youth... C?mon, Eduardo. Are you walking down the memory lane? No, my dear. I'm not! I live for today! But you don't quite live, you do crazy things! Ah, those delicious things! That's why I'll never get old! Those things make you younger and younger! Look at Maria Helena and her adventure with Bebeto... She's the proof I'm right! Life is a long and wild ride! Hmm, this kind of philosophy, could only come from you! Who is this fellow? Do you know him, Eduardo? I know everybody in Copacabana! Everybody or every boy? Anyway, I have the record on this fellow you're all drooling over. Count me out! I'm not interested in a beach soccer player! Yes, we're talking about a boy with great physical qualities... ...And about his values? Well, I don't care for that! C'mon, he's just a wise guy who wants to hook Maria Helena. To get married? I have pity on him! He's gonna get in trouble! It's not the marriage he is after... He just wants to live... In comfort. Bebeto is a nice and handsome boy, who knows the value of being nice and handsome! He also knows how to deal with your philosophy about a wild life. Maria Helena is not the same in white, isn't she? It?s true, but her swimming suit fits her like a glove! So Eduardo. What about our heroes? dossier? A long time ago, he would be called a fortune hunter. Nowadays, Whisky hunter! What do you hold against him? She's not being nice! Oh, I met him at Paula's party. He tried to be sweet on me, expecting I would fall for him. And you did not like it? She knows him better than me. Of course! I'm practical! He's nothing but a wolf. And if you are friends of the girl, you should warn her, before it's too late. Don't worry, Maria Helena know what she is doing! She's got some class! - Hello, how are you dear? - I'm fine, and you? - What a drag! - Yes, I know Yvone's gang. - Especially Yvone, isn't it? - No, she is not my type. She's not your type, but you could not leave her side at Paula's party. It's not like that. She was the one that didn't leave me alone. And you wouldn't have anything to do with a young, unmarried, independent girl... You're right! I'm a wolf. But I'll be retiring soon, won't even go to the disco. And what are you going to do with your life? I'll be with you. Hmm... How classy! Let's go, Bebeto? I want to go to Arpoador beach. - And this afternoon, what's the schedule? - I have to go out with my parents. Hey sir! Sir, give me some money. You stroke down my can of peanuts. - I don't know what are you talking about - But you have to pay me. I do I have to do with it? - But you have to pay me! - Go away, you brat! But you stroke down my can in the water! If you come near me again, I'll have you arrested! - What Happened? - This wise guy, is trying to cheat me. Those parents that leave those children in the streets are criminals! - Are you getting better, Judite? - A little. - I brought you a soup. - Thanks, but you shouldn't bother. - I'm not hungry! - But you have to eat! It's not a good sign. Did you have some tea? It's good for your chest! I'm taking that medicine that cured Jorge's son. You shouldn't take medicine that comes in a bottle. You never know what's inside. At home, we only take herbs. I prefer herbs. When I'm better, I'll go to Viridiana's to get some strong medicine. Mrs. Viridiana has the power to heal. Some say she even took care of Alexandre, who was near his grave. Yesterday I visited him, and he is strong like a bull. He works day and night, and no more diseases. Have you told him, his blue shirt was already torn? I told him. But one demanding client is that one from the apartment! I can't understand how you put up with all those people! She complains a lot, but pays good. The other clients you should not worry. I'll take care of them all. When you can't take it anymore, tell me. I don't want to interfere with your job. Oh, I'm used to it. One more client is always good. Besides, one hand washes the other. Someday I'll need your help. It's true, we never know what will come next. Never. And we are all alone, because our children don't give us any help. Depend on them is like expecting to win the lottery! - But you still have your husband. - Quinca? He's old an unemployed. It?s good you mentioned him. I have to chase him. And don't you forget to take your tea. Don't you get any drafts. So long. So long, thanks. There you go, the Queen and King without any tricks. - I'll put 30 on the queen. - I'll have the King. I want the king too. Have you ever seen a poor man being a king? - Hey, I want things to be straight. - Me too, but today... Is Quinca here? Where is Quinca? He was here. Played a game and went left to buy a rooster to put in a fight. - Did you forget about me? - It's not the fifth of the month. I know, I know. Last time you forgot to pay the rent. Ok, Mr. Nagib. We never forget you. Oh, those people are always forgetting. We have to stay put. - You must pay today, no excuses. - Mr. Nagib, things here are difficult. Find a way, otherwise you'll have no lights for the dance. If you wait until tomorrow, I can pay you with the beer money. I can't, I can't. Watch out for the light! Guys, things are getting worst! This one here is for paying the light of my place. But first I'll try to make it grow! - Why don't you do the same? - Are you crazy? This one here is sacred. I'll have to make it with the golden book. - Have you seen Miro? - I'm waiting for him. - Give up, he's in jail. - He is in jail? Why? - Don't you know? He was arrested. - Stay here, I'll go to the station. - Miro will soon be getting his... - I don't think so. Miro has always fought. And those who fought are always prepared to win. That's true. Do you remember Vav?? He was a tough guy. But Miro finished him in no time. - It was Miro's best fight, wasn't it? - What? Miro's greatest fight was on that strike. He fought three policeman at the same time. He busted one jaw and the other two ran away. That's what I say... Those who always fight, have more strength. But why did he pick a fight in the market? The other man said something about Alice. And Miro is crazy about her. Here comes the police! Good afternoon, fellas. Hold on, this guy don't look like a cop. Do you know where Alice lives? It's over there. - That one with the flowers. - Thanks a lot. He is doomed, this one. - Who is this guy? - He must be Alice's boyfriend. You got to have some guts to come here like this. - I hope Miro is kept until tomorrow. - One less headache. - Hi, Flor. Will we have some beans? - Today you'll fill your belly! - Leave me alone. Give me the money. - No. This rooster is no good. - Mother, look, here's Alberto. - I'm sorry, Sir. You must return the rooster, I won't give you any money. Don't you be so stubborn. Can't you see this rooster is strong? I'll fix my life with it. No you won't. I'm not giving you the money. - I want the money, old woman. - You don't know where it is hidden. - Leave me! - It's mine, no! Don't be so stupid! It's mine. I worked for it! I will make more money, more! - The rooster escaped! - Catch it! Miro... Miro! How was it? It was easy. Let's go. - Now? - Yes, I have to talk to that bitch. But Miro, and what about the game? - What time is it? - It's time. - Do you have any money? - Yes, for both of us. So let's go. I'll talk to her tonight. You stay right here! Don't leave the can. Read all about it! The formation of the Teams! Foguinho substitutes Daniel. Next time, pay attention, hmm? You must learn how to move backwards. Let's go Carlos, it was nothing! No, no... It's not a problem with the supporters of the team. But you mustn?t forget that Daniel is playing for Pengo for the last ten years. This won't stop the deal, if your Club accept my conditions. It's too expensive. We won't pay a million for a player that will be put aside. If they want Daniel is because they know he'll be a success in S?o Paulo. With a few games he'll bring the back the invested money. - So, we can trade the players. - It's possible. But look out for the supporters. That guy there will take care of the supporters. In a week, nobody will miss Daniel. Are you blind, you stupid jerk? You support Pengo, don't you? Foguinho won't do any good... You'll see... You'll see... - What? - If Foguinho plays. So what? Pengo is going to lose because of that? But it is worth it to seat under this heat to see Pengo loose. And it will lose by many goals. Without Daniel it's going to be a massacre. What massacre? Who told you Daniel isn't playing? Everybody knows that. Foguinho will be his substitute. It's obvious! Look here, who is playing is PENGO Soccer Club, ok? Pengo IS Daniel! You won't even see the color of the ball! And why should we see the color of the ball? Bullshit! What bullshit!? I think you're going to play. It's too hot for Daniel. Don't embarrass me. It's my name at stake, too. - Mr. Mario, have you decided yet? - Almost, boy. You have a great responsibility. We're talking about the final game here. The Club needs to win a championship. Excuse me. The kid must play, and well. Can you make sure it happens? Yes, If it were my responsibility. But it depends on the boy and he is nervous. Well, It's settled. I wish him a good match. And you'll be rid of Daniel's temper. - Does Daniel knows he's out of the match? - I don't know. Dr. Pires is attending him. Pengo against Baronesa, 1949. 2x1. I fractured my ankle. South American Championship, 1952. Brazilian National Team, 1954. Ten years of Championships, fights. International Cups. Ten Years of Pengo, the greatest team. Go on Doctor. It's nice to revisit the past of a great player. I have more memories of my career. I'm only worried about your medical condition. They want to know if I can play and if I could be injured in this heat. The heat is too much for you, that's for sure. C'mon Doctor! The heat is there for everyone. It's not quite like that. The match will be strong and the temperature is high. I can't allow you to play. I know all about it, you have to put a younger boy on the match. Why all the fuss? That's enough, Daniel. I'll be frank with you. You only have one year in your profession. Face the facts. I know about reality, doctor. So, did you get it? The formation stays the same. Except for the left wing... ...where Foguinho will play. You can register for the match. It doesn't matter. Pengo will win with or without Foguinho. Shut up, you're not a real supporter. C'mon, I'm for Pengo all the way! You're gonna fight outside, tramps! Beat it or I'll put you in jail. - Clown! Have you any money left? - I spent it all. Paulinho, are you with Trigo? You're going to lend me some money, ok? There is only seven. Hot peanuts, just one Cruzeiro. Hot peanuts, just one Cruzeiro. Hey, I'll be leaving soon. And I'm not working for Mr. Peixoto anymore. If he catches me here, I'll be damned. I work for myself, I'm not afraid of anybody. You talk like that because you don't know Mr. Peixoto. He is an old beast... - He don't even allow women to work. - I'm in tears... - For whom do you work? - What is it to you? - Is it for your mother? - It's not for you! Are you working for Neco? Talk! Do you work for Neco? I'll kill Neco and all his gang! Go away! Go tell Neco! - I don't know any Neco. - Go away! Hey, leave the boy alone! An old man chasing a young kid! He owes me money! It's a lie, he wants to break my can of peanuts. What is this? Are you crazy? Break his can? Go away or I'll break this can you have for your face. Tell me, why would he break your can? Because I work alone and this is his point. He demands half of the money I get. Why don't you call the police? Because they might arrest us too. It's prohibited to do this type of selling. Look, I can see the top of that building! - Look, it's very high! - Cool down, Nino. Gina, give some education to your boy. Why don't you? Haven't you got any left? What is the matter with you? - How much? - 60 Cruzeiros. - But is it American? - Sure, I bought it in the black market. Nino, stay close to your mother! - Where do you live? - I live in the slum. - Which one? - Cabu?u Hill. - Cabu?u? And your mother? - She is dead. - But your father works. - I don't have any father. - But how do you leave? - In the slum. Poor thing. Over there, people. Hey, it's too bright here. So come this way, over here. Here we go, folks. - That's it. - Now you get here. - Let me take the picture. - No, we'll all be together. But is going to take the picture? Hey kid. Hold it tight. Look through here and push this button. Done it! You can't stay here. Hey, hot peanuts! Two? Look... I thought it was bigger than that! - Please put the belt on. - I've already done that, miss. I don't know why all the fuss about a deputy substitute. Yeah, but not all the substitutes are that close to the Minister. I still have to go to Maracan? Stadium. - Look, how Mr. Francisco is happy. - Yes, he should be. I guarantee you the investigation will be put aside for lack of evidence. Hello, how are you? - Will he remember my name? - Will he stay in my place? Hey, you're all out of your minds. If Duron stay in our place will be hard to explain things for him. It's better to reach him now or he will disappear. Hey my deputy, give me a hug. C'mon Mr. Chico, don't call me deputy. You were born a deputy, Colonel. - You will be in my place, won't you? - I don't know, mister. I have to arrange some things... - Your Excellence... - How are you? Your Excellence, the Minister welcomes you. - We are at your service. - The Minister couldn't come. He had to travel south. So tell him to go to my place, as soon as he arrives. Your excellence, we have everything prepared for you. Your excellence, I'd like to know your opinion on the Ministerial Reform. Very nice. With my friend as Minister, Brazil will get better. You're saying, your excellence, that you support the reform? Oh, yes. But this time, they did not created the most important ministry. The ministry of Cattle and Crops. The deputy is talking about the dismembering of the Ministry of Agriculture. Mr. Deputy. I'd like to introduce Fernando. He'll be your secretary. Secretary? Oh, no, I already have one. But Mr. Fernando is an specialist in Agriculture. He was appointed by the party to assist you in the House of Representatives. More efficient than my secretary here, I guarantee you he won't be. Especially when it comes to matters of properties. - But Mr. Deputy... - Anyway, send him in tomorrow. - This is my wife, Mr. deputy. - It's a pleasure. - Is this your daughter? - It's a pleasure to meet you. - I decided, I'll stay at his place. - Of course, your excellence. So let's go, I've got your luggage. You are a great man, Chico! Let's go. First of all, I have to take care of something. I have to visit the Statue of Christ. That's why we have a car here. - Cool down! - Let me... Lady, will you give me some money? We don't have anything. - Will you give some money? - Get a job! Will you give some money? - Hey, what is it? - You don't know how to beg. I'm not begging. I just need some money to go home. Do you want to know how to take money from this people? Will you give me some money? My mother is very ill. Thanks. See? You can't ask money for yourself. Ask for your poor mother. Just tell them she is sick, and you won't miss. It's here, Pedro. - Is my brother here? - What is his name? What are you doing here, sister? I just came to see if you received a letter from mother. It's been a while since I've received one. And you, have any news? This is Pedro. - It's a pleasure. - Pleasure. Pedro wants to talk to you, Tonho. - So? - I want to marry Judite. - When? - As soon as I'm released. - Sys, do you like him? - I do, Tonho. Ok, them, you can take care of the papers. - There is something else, Tonho. - What is it? Wait for us over there. She isn't to blame... We didn't mean any harm... I wish I were at Maracan? Stadium. If I was Superman, I'd jump and land right in the field. Look, a Cadillac! - It's hot, will you want it? - Go away! Scram! I'll pay one more promise and then I'm free! - And the peanuts? - Scram! I'm not a peanut man! Mr. Duron, how many employees do you have? I don't know, exactly. I remember last year, I had... ...1200 employees, without including the caretakers of the farm. Francisco, I can't climb the stairs. You know that, don't you? I think it's your heart, isn't it, my dear? - Leninha will take the deputy upstairs. - Oh yes. Ok father, you can stay here. I will take care of Dr. Duron. Let's go! You almost ruined everything! And you? You said it in a way that he almost discovered everything. So what? Can't you see the old man is crazy about her? Don't worry, she will take care of everything, now. My daughter is an angel of heaven... Will you get accustomed with Rio de Janeiro? For an old men, all the grass is green. - But sir, you never left Minas Gerais... - Don't call me sir. Just between us, I'm not akin with ceremonies. Neither am I. I can see we'll get along just fine. For that matter, I have a big heart. But tell me, girl. What does your father want with me? - Oh... You're very clever! - Longelino, beat it... - Do you think I was born yesterday? - Clever and even cute! So tell me what it is. Just say it. Well, father got mix up in something, and now don't know how to get rid of it. Here you are, peanuts for one Cruzeiro. One Cruzeiro, take it. We are almost there. Peanuts, peanuts! Wait here, I'll buy the tickets. Run, Paulinho! Say something, Tonho. Help me! Have you lost your mind? Forgive me, Tonho. Forgive me. If it had happened in our homeland, you would be punished. And him, too. But here people think different. And there isn't any tough guys like there! - But we are getting married. - Help me, Tonho. There's no one else. I'll help by not getting in your way. And don't tell mother. God gave you the right time, sister. I told you, it's the last time. Hey, there is Cadinho. Cadinho! How are you Cadinho? Yesterday you didn't show up. Oh, now I'm a serious man. I'm even raising a family. - Are you engaged? - The girl is hooked... Don't you worry, girl. I'm going to fix Chico's problem. And I thought you were the old man with a hard of stone. You were wrong. I'm even younger than most of the boys around here. And why are you not married? Me? This horse don't like the saddle. Look. I'll be here in Rio. And may need a secretary. Clever, beautiful... And willing to do a lot of work. Something like three days a week! Only three? Yes. If you like it, we can give it a try. Sometimes, it works! Longelino! Go forward. And if he wants to marry soon? I think we must throw a great party! First you'll have to talk to the Minister. C'mon, this problem was solved. With the money, we can buy that property in Jacarepagua. But is it guaranteed that the Institute will make a building there? That's for sure! - So, Duron, did you like it? - Rio is very small, isn't it? There are no green places anymore. All I can see are buildings and hills! Pengo starts the match! The ball is with Henrique... ...he strikes the ball. Arm?nio grabs it... He had no angle for striking! - Nice one! - The defense just stays there! What a clown! This is not the way to do it! I'm telling you! Without Daniel, this team is worthless! Go Foguinho! Go Foguinho! Jerk! He was alone there! Where is Daniel? He had no angle! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! This player is worthless! DANIEL! DANIEL! - This referee is a thief! - Shut up, Shorty! GOOOOOOAL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! DANIEL! - Turn this thing off! - C'mon grandpa, have patience! - This old man is a drag! - Leave him alone... Let's drown our sorrows together... - Don't mess with her! - But how are we gonna pay? I don't know. Go to the slum and take the money. C'mon, the girl is in to it. And furthermore, I'm listening to the match. You'll go there, and afterwards I'll tell you who won. "Ladies and Gentlemen, Foguinho lost a lot of opportunities... " Bring me one more, very cold! It's no good! You can't drown your sorrows. - So I played that a lot! - You know your business! I was the leader of the band... But know, I don't have any breath... - Oh, no... Your chest is still good... - Yeah, but in the past... Everybody heard just my trombone, when the band played. I'm here today, willing to steal the girl. I want to marry her, Mr. Joaquim. I agree! God bless you, my sons. Look, old woman. He even brought a ring! - I arranged the church, too. - Let's celebrate, old woman! You have already celebrated. Let me work, now! - Let's go downstairs? - Excuse me, Mr. Joaquim. I would ask your hand in the traditional way, but I couldn't. - Are you really willing to marry me? - Yes I am, Flor. This place remember my hometown. When I was a kid, I stood up on a hill and watched the city and the sea. At night, the lights. What is the matter now? This is your day. Queen of the ball, you're engaged daddy here... It's because of my father... He is unemployed for 2 years, and if I leave, mother will be all alone. - Let's wait, Alberto? - For how long? Until things get better. I wish to have a good marriage and live in a nice place. Things will get better, but it will not just be for us two. Don't you think these people suffer like us? They won't grow on a few pennies. It's just that I wanted to have a nice and neat home, like my mother had. Even if we put our money together, We would only be able to live here on the hill. So what? There is a lot of good people around here. - Yes, we have to accept that. - Not accept. We have to face the facts! So, you're Alberto! I heard a lot about you. Take some advise. Don't bring this fellow down to the square tonight. - You know how Waldomiro is... - Are you afraid of Waldomiro? - Hello, brother! - Hey, Here's Jos?! - I know! You're the leader of the Samba! - Of course! I'm always on the lead! - Do you still work there? - Sure, I even got the minimum wage! - And you? - I'm getting by... I'll introduce you to Alcebiades. But Alcebiades, he's not a stranger, he is my groom... Well, You take care of your life... Alcebiades, this is the "baiano". - Feel at home! - Thanks! Will you lend me 50 bucks? It's for Miro, he will pay you later. - Who is this fellow with Alice? - Tell him, it's her groom. Come here. - What happened? - The kid is terrified. But I'm not to blame. How is that? You told me he was ready to play. - No, not in that words. - Yes, you did. You said it with all the letters. You've put me in a mess with the supporters and the managers. I didn't want him to play. You insisted, sir. He is a good player, but it's not in the same level of Daniel. But today he is going to be. He can't fail anymore. You'll talk to him, promise him something. As long as he plays well in the second half. The press is prepared to make him a hero. And other thing. If Foguinho plays well, your contract will be renewed. You will stay with us for one year more. Strength, people! There's still a chance. We can win this match! Did you notice that their defense is weak? Very weak in the right wing? This is the way to their goal. They will weaken this side, hoping Foguinho won't get better. But we will do the thing they least expect. We're gonna use Foguinho as our main striker. And this means that all the strikes should center on him. That's it! Luck to us all, and strength! Have faith in god and let's go! Your responsibility is even bigger, now. Mr. Mario, I can't see very well. It would be better if I didn't return. Don't say that. I've watched you, you'll fulfill my expectations. Leave your cares behind. - It's normal to be nervous. - The supporters are against me. Don't you think about them. The journalists that know about soccer support you. Look, a rich supporter told me to offer you some money if you strike a goal. Let's go, kid. I'm sure you're able to defend the tradition of our club! Look, kid. What they said is alright, but you have to know something else. You have to be strong and defend your place. Your place and job. - Would you like to do something instead? - No. So go to the field, and show yourself. If you don't do this now, you won't get another chance. Are you still afraid? - I wish I was far away. - Now it's too late. Think about the supporters. Not only them, but think about you. They know how to repay a good and honest player. - I still don't know why they replaced you. - This is another story. Maybe is because I'm old. But the day will come when we won't be a product anymore. FOGUINHO! - What did I tell you? - Take it easy, the match isn't over, yet. - Is it true you're gonna sell Daniel? - Not a chance. We want Daniel to play for Pengo until the end of his career. GOOOOOOAL! I told you! Foguinho! Have you seen that? That's what I'm talking about. That's it. Foguinho improved his game. Haven't I told you? The kid is playing much better! - That was luck! - Foguinho! - Let's go? - When will we meet again? Maybe Sunday... Ok? That's OK. - Where? - At the same place, OK? - Is it bad for you? - No. - So, until next Sunday. - See you. - Pedro! - What? It's nothing. Will we really meet at that place? Yes, that's right. Goodbye. Look, there he is. - Who are you? - Why do you wanna know? GOOOOOOOAL! I told you! He is the greatest! Fantastic! At the last minute of the match, Foguinho strikes the winning goal! Let's hear now, the words of Foguinho! - I just had some luck... - You've heard the words of Foguinho... ...Pengo's secret weapon. Let's hear now Mario Almeida, the coach that put Foguinho in the decisive match. We were confident at the victory. That's why we've made it. Why didn't you wait? Where is the money? What? So you lost it... - Hey boy, come here. - I'm going. Go home! You will pay me. - What is it, Mrs. Elvira? - Have you seen Jorge? - He said he was going to Copacabana. - He's taking so long... - Hey Zeca! - Look, the money for the ball! - Where is Jorge? - I don't know, Mrs. Elvira. - Today it was easy, and for you? - I worked hard and Paulo lost the money. - You're lying, show me the money! - I'm telling you, Paulo lost it! He is gonna pay me, I tell you. - Hey, look here comes Sujinho! - What is it? Where does the father of this boy live? - Well, he is going with me. - Leave him here, officer. I can't. The commissioner is wondering if he has any parents. He hasn't any parents. He lives here with me and my son. We take care of him. OK kid, beat it and don't show your face anymore! Thanks, officer! - Is he still there? - Yes. And she is enjoying it. I will put an end to that! They sure are singing! Let's go. Don't you wanna come? How? - So long. - So long. Attention.
