(suspenseful music) - Lenas, Noah, Bender, Anybody? Gone, they are all gone. (door slamming) - For fuck's sake, it's okay. Don't shoot! - Jimmy, Christ! Are you okay? - I think I broke my leg. I thought you were dead, man. What happened? - Oh man, when those things hit the dining room I got pinned in the kitchen. I had to use a forced air vent to get out. Where are the others? - There are no others, those things, they tore up my paper dolls. What were they? What the fuck were they? - I don't know, man. But I'm not sticking around to find out. Come on, let me help you up. We'll get you out of here. - Oh, my leg! (roaring) They've got me! - I need my gun. Jimmy, you've got to let go, I need my gun. (roaring) (gun shots) (screaming) (blood dripping) (roaring) (heaving) (roaring) (loud screams) (soft guitar playing) - [Man] Christ, how much do you think this place is worth? - [Man] You couldn't even afford the light bill. - [Man] I can't afford a freaking burger. - [Man] It's just a house guys, nothing more. It's just wood, plaster, and maybe some very expensive marble. That's it. - [Man] I could fit a small town in this place. - [Woman] I feel like I'm standing in front of the holy grail. I can't believe I'm going into the Fischer House. (heavy door slams) (all talking over each other) - [Man] Living large! - [Man] Have you seen anything like this, unbelievable. - Guys, guys, quiet down until we figure out what's going on here. - My name is John Stoker. Welcome to my home. I'm glad you could all make it. - [Woman] Wow, this house is in great shape. - I've been restoring it to its former glory. I have added a few modern touches here and there but I have tried to keep it as close to its original beauty as possible. - You've done a great job. I don't think I've ever been in a house this elegant. - Thank you. Well, I guess introductions are in order. I'd like to learn more about each of you. - I'm Ted Sturgeon. I guess you could say I'm the leader of our little society. I'm a field energy expert. - The best, the guy's a natural EMF detector. - I've heard of you, Ted. Your background is most impressive. - Thanks. Over here we have Ketchum and Monks. Two veterans in the paranormal field. They've forgotten more than most of us know. The young men over here are Clegg and Shelly. They'll be doing a video documentation of the house. - We're just glorified interns man, that's all. - Don't sell yourself short. I saw the ORR piece you guys shot with Discovery, it was good stuff. - You saw that? - Thanks, man. - And we have Erin Cooper, our resident crystal ball, she hasn't been with us very long but has produced some incredible results in that time. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure is mine. Well, I guess I'll start with the briefing. This house was built by a man named Alfred Fischer. Fischer was a notorious conman, who made his fortune peddling drugs and whores on the carnie circuit. What he built here was, for all intensive purposes, a whorehouse. It became the most popular and successful one of its day. But, rumors of dark pagan rituals, forced Fischer to close the doors. Fischer was rumored to be an occultist. Wealthy patrons filled his bank account for a glimpse, and sometimes a taste, of the power he supposedly wielded. And eventually he just vanished, no one knows for sure what happened to him. Some speculate that an incantation gone wrong claimed his life. Quite possibly his soul. But the house remained, and has become one of the biggest hot spots of paranormal activity on the east coast. I have to warn you folks, this place makes Amityville look like a spinning teacup ride. The manifestations can be harsh and jarring. Some very nasty stuff put down seeds here. - As long as we can catch it on film, harsh is fine with us. - I bought the place for a song five years ago. I have had numerous parapsychologists and psychics here to help me investigate the place, and cleanse the horrible energy that resides here. Every attempt has failed. You were brought in to take a crack at it. And if you can, help me cleanse this house. I will give you enough funding to keep your organization going for a long time. - Fair enough. - So, let's get started. - Okay, before we do... - Is there a problem? - I have the impression that there's a gun under your jacket. - Hm, damn you're good. What gave it away, did you smell the gun oil? - Actually yeah I did. (laughs) - That is incredible. I definitely hired the right people. - Still, I have an issue with that. - What do you mean? - Well guns shoot bullets, bullets kill people. People like us. - I certainly appreciate your concern, but I assure you, the gun is meant only for squatters, vandals and wild animals. We are in proximity of an abandoned asylum, and although they closed the gates over five years ago, I do occasionally find former patients walking here. I do the best I can, but from time to time receive unexpected guests. The gun is merely for effect, I have never fired it. And I do have a permit to carry it. - Still, it makes me nervous. - I have no intention of putting it away. But I will compromise with you, seeing the obvious distress it's causing. I'll double your pay. - That's more than fair, right Ted? - Yeah, okay. - Okay. Now that we're all on the same page, let's begin. (eerie ambient noise) (whispering in a foreign language) - Erin! Easy now. - Are you alright? Should I call a doctor? - What the fuck happened? - Relax, I'm fine. Place just overwhelmed me for a second. There's definitely energy to be found here. - What happened? Did you see something? - No, but I felt something. It was a concentrated slap in the face, and I wasn't ready for it so soon. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine, it comes with the territory. - Why don't you uh, knock the road dust off before we start? Give Ms. Cooper an opportunity to collect herself. - Really, it's not necessary, this isn't the first time I've been sucker punched in the line of duty. - I insist. Actually I have some things I can attend to just now. Please make yourselves at home, I'll return shortly. - We'll be here when you're ready. (beeping) Listen, we gotta talk. - Ted, there isn't a problem, stop looking for one and for god's sakes don't make one. - I am responsible-- - You're responsible for paying your bills, I mean none of us are in this for the money, but we all have to eat. If we treat this guy right, and take advantage of this marvelous opportunity, we may just make something of ourselves. Go outside, cool your heels, we don't need you upsetting the newbies with your trademark paranoia. - He's right, you gotta relax about this stuff. This is the Fischer house, man, the mecca east coast horror house. And not only are we here, we've got a guided tour and a paying gig, this is big time. - I'll get some air. This discussion isn't over. Nobody leaves this room until I get back. - What was that all about? - Oh just papa bear worried about his cubs going into the dark woods. The usual pre-jitter routine of our commander-in-chief. You'll get used to it. - Yeah, he's just overprotective. - Well, I can take care of myself. - Yeah? I'm sure you can. - So you guys think we'll actually get anything here? - Well, for the sake of book and movie deals, I sure hope so. - And what about science? - Yeah, that too. - Try not to break the time code, okay? It's such a pain the ass to load. - Fine dude, chill, dude one mistake and you never let me forget about it. - You do it all the time. - So why bother making a big deal out of it? - You need stock? - Yeah. - I thought I told you to buy some last week? - Fuck, man, look I'm broke okay? I'm sorry but my parents stopped sending me checks, and I'm gonna get taken to court over my student loans. - Man you need to learn to manage money. - Oh I do, do I? Thank you, I knew that. Doesn't look like this Stoker guy has a problem with that now does he? You know, one little knickknack from this place and I could probably pay off my student loans-- - Man, don't even think it. - I'm just talking here. Fuckin' A. It's good to be the king. (beeping) - [Stoker] Monks, can you hear me? - [Monks] Loud and clear boss. - Okay, here's how we'll play it. Ted, I'd like you to take the upper west wing, Ketchum, you take the lower west wing. Clegg and Shelly, I'd like you to split the difference between the upper and lower east wings. Erin, you come with me, I have some particular hot spots I'd like to investigate with you. Are you up for it? - Absolutely. Listen, all of you, I was caught offguard before, but I can handle this, so no kid girls or I'll kick all of your sorry asses. - That's the Erin I know. - Okay, if anyone has a problem, chime in. Otherwise, let's keep channel one silent. - Monks, Ketchum, you read me? - Yeah I just switched over to channel two a few seconds ago. What's with you and this cell roaster shit? You watch too many spy movies. - [Ted] Are we alone on this channel Monks? - [Monks] As far as I can tell. - Thoughts gentlemen? - Regarding our eccentric host? He seems okay to me. - Wish I could say the same. The guy isn't being straight with us, I can tell. There's something strange about him. - If you have an aversion to strange people, Ted, my boy, you're in the wrong business. - Yeah he's offering good money, Ted. Money we're in need of. And at twice the original rate. - Something just doesn't sit right with me. The guy gives me a bad feeling, man. - Leave the precognition to Erin okay? I got work to do, I'm back on one. - Monks. - I'm still with you man. - Am I being an overbearing prick again? - Yeah, but, you know you're just looking out for your people. - Well somebody has to. God knows what would happen to you guys if I wasn't around. I'm switching back to one, shake my cage if you need me. - Will do. (door slams) (high-pitched ambient noise) - Holy... Oh yeah. I bet that thing's worth a fortune. (door creaks) (loud sound effect) (beeping) - Bullet holes. Monks. Monks, you there? I found something. (beeping) (echoing roar) - Make a pretty decent horror flick here. (whistling) - [Voiceover] Ketchum, are you making that racket? - Sorry. Pardon me, mein Fuhrer. (ghastly ambient noises) (distant tool tinging) (tool tinging rapidly) (laughter) - Thanks. That would've hurt. - No doubt. - Look, I hope you weren't offended by what Ted said. He's just very protective. - And so am I, that's why I insisted on keeping the gun. - You don't really think you're gonna need to use it though, do you? - Probably not. But I have had to run a few junkies and crazies out of here, it's always something to be concerned about. - So where are we heading? - Into the bowels of Hell. Or actually, the backbone of the establishment. The service rooms are down here, it seems to be where most of the energy resides. Are you okay? - There's something... I don't know... I just got this gnawing feeling inside. I feel a lot of negative energy here. - I've seen this place turn a few people like you inside out from the moment they stepped in here. But it's okay, nothing can hurt you. I won't let anything hurt you. (voices chatting in the distance) (distant piano) (doorknob rattling) - Fuck you. (door creaking) (ambient echoing sounds) (zapping) - Monks. Monks, it's Ted, come in. Monks! - Go ahead big guy. - [Voiceover] I'm still prowling, probably will be for a while. Anything happen? - Nada, all systems are green. - [Voiceover] Good, I'll radio you if I find anything. - Monks, Monks, Monks it's Ted I don't know who the fuck that was, but it wasn't me! Monks, that wasn't me on channel one! (echoing roar) Shit. (screaming and roaring) - Hey uh, Sturgeon? I lost you there, man. Okay, there you are man, never mind. - It begins, again. - Oh. Hello! Hey! Anyone there? Clegg? Sweet! Hello. What the fuck? (laughs) Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh! (laughs) I love you. Hey, anyone there? Clegg! Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy! Alright, cool. Don't worry, it's all going to a good cause. Oh yeah. Get... Mine. Oh my god. Damn it. Caught on tape, nice. (loud ambient noises) Shit. Hey look, okay, I'm not a bad guy, okay? I just... I'm sick, I don't even know why I took it! I have problems. Look... I'll just... Everything goes back. Good as new, right? Please. Don't hurt me, please! This isn't real. They can't hurt me. Just, go away, please! Just leave me alone! Please go away! The power of Christ compels you! Oh shit, it worked. Yeah! That's right you pussy shit bags! You don't fuck with Shelly! - [Voiceover] Yo, Shelly, what's happening dude? - Hey! - [Voiceover] Hey, you alright dude? - No I'm fine man. - [Voiceover] You sure you're alright man? - No, no, I'm good. I just found out I had a shit tape in the camera, I lost a lot of really good stuff. You really gotta spring for better media, man. Fuck me. (heavy breathing) Ah. Fuck you. (heavy breathing) - What's your story? Your gift, was it something you were born with? - Every woman on my mother's side always had intuition. - Did you lose someone? - My father. I was 300 miles away in college when it happened, but... I knew he had died. I knew before the phone call. - I'm sorry. - I guess that's when I decided to use my abilities to try and help people. So, you've had a lot of people in this place? - A lot of people did disappear when this place celebrated its hay day. - What do you think the story was? Do you believe the rumors? - Absolutely. From the records I found, I think Fischer was able to accomplish something in this house that we can only dream of. The man was decades ahead of his time, a true pioneer in the occult field. I know he wasn't a hero. Loose women and easy money were as sacred to him as anything we hold dear. - That happens to people sometimes I guess. - I guess it does. So, what brought you here? It couldn't be the ambiance. - Well before your phone call, we were about ready to close our doors. Our funding was cut. - I guess this is an important gig for you guys. - It's life or death. (shower running) (moaning) (beeping) (peeing) - Uh. Making the bladder gladder. Next best thing to an orgasm. (humming) - Oh, I didn't know there was a gentleman caller I had tonight. Why... Look at me, I'm not even dressed for a visitor. - Folks, we got a squatter here. Hello, hello? Looks like we have one of those former patients Stoker was mentioning. - Who are you talking to? - No one, obviously. What are you doing here? - Well, I live here. The question is, what are you doing here? Are you a thief? Take what you will, but please, don't hurt me. - No, I'm uh... Part of a research team, I'm not here to hurt you. - Well, I hope not. There isn't much I could do to fend off a strong man like yourself. Why I suppose you could force me to your will right here and now, and there is nary a thing I could do about that. (laughs) I'm Pauline, and you are? - Um... Ketchum. - I see, so that's what you do to them... Catch them. And what do you do to them after you catch them? Something naughty, and not at all proper, I'd imagine, like all those fantasies you've entertained. Taking a woman by force, subjecting her to your power, bending her to your will. - Okay wait a minute, I get it, this is a little fantasy of mine. Except usually I'm a warden at a women's prison. Don't even wanna ask what a shrink would say about that. (giggles) - Why not enjoy it then? I won't tell on you. - I get it now. It's all making sense. The shower, you, this whole scenario. The house is fucking with me. This is a hallucination. - You're a silly one. Does this... Feel like a hallucination to you? - This is wrong. What are you doing to me? - What I do best, Mr. Ketchum. Hey, what... I've never been with a man before. - Oh, oh. - Ah, ah. (heavy breathing) - What the hell am I doing? - How could you do this to me? I told you I didn't want to. Look what you've done to me. - I don't know what came over me, I'm sorry. - You've ruined me. You made me ugly. - You're beautiful. (roars) (screaming) (roaring) (grunting) (roars) - Now you're the ugly one, Mr. Ketchum! How does it feel to be the weak one? The victim, flesh for the beast. You had a taste, and now I want a taste. (death metal music) (roars) - This is so weird. - What's that? - I don't know. This place feels familiar. It's like I've been in this room before. - Yeah, you're the fourth psychic who has felt that. Deja vu I guess. - So who were some of the previous people you've brought in? Anyone I would know? - I don't think so. - Try me, I follow a lot of people. - Well I can't remember any of the names off the top of my head right now. Could we possibly focus on the task at hand please? - Sorry. - No, I'm sorry. It's just that we're in the hottest room in the house right now and I always get a little nervous in here. I didn't mean to snap, I'd be happy to look up some of the names for you after we're done here. - If you want, it isn't that important. - Do you want me to leave while you.. You know, plug in? - As much as I'd hate to be alone in here, yeah you should. Don't go too far? - I'll be right outside. Jimmy. (loud echoing roar) (deafening growling) (high-pitched tone) - Fischer. - If you have what I desire, there would be more than this. - I ask for no more. - Then that is what you shall receive. What are you doing? I paid for the amulet, not for gypsy drama. - What you are looking for has to be hidden deep, Fischer. Deeper than a mortal can look. As deep as the soul. I believe this is what you are looking for? Yes. (ominous tone) - And now here is, in my hands. - To be added to your other curio perhaps? A museum of magic to only gaze upon, but never test. - What I do is none of your concern. - I see hunger in your eyes. - Yes, I came from a long line of hungry men. - You listen to me, Fischer. This is old magic, older than time. You use it wisely, or it will have its way with you. It has a hungerous way. - I'm not paying you for the gypsy one. - And I'm not charging you for it. It's all part of the service. - Our business is done. It's done with. (mumbles) (gurgling and grunting) (distant laughing) - I have been pacing this floor for almost... I don't know, an hour? A little more, and nothing to report except for a leaky radiator. Ketchum! What's up man? (flashlight clicks) Hey, did something happen? Ketchum, wait up! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. - What happened? - I had a vision of Fischer, he appeared to me in this room and showed me something. Something to do with that medallion that he wears in the painting. - What about the medallion? Did he show you where it is? - John, you're hurting me! - I'm sorry, I just... I've never had anyone get anything this substantial before. You are as good as Sturgeon said. Better. Come on, there are other rooms in the house. - I just need a few minutes, okay? That took a lot out of me. - Of course, I apologize. Please, catch your breath. Take as long as you need. - Thank you. - Ketchum, are you okay? (ball bouncing) (door creaking) (toys whirring) - You like them? I collect toys from all over the world. - Shit, I didn't know anyone was in here. Who are you? - I'm Cassandra, silly. - You live here? - Well, of course. Where else would I live? - Does anyone know you live here? - You do. You know, I've been watching you all day. I'm just curious, why are you creeping around in the dark? Did you come here to spy on me? Catch me without my undies on? Cause I never seem to wear them. Or much else. Do you mind? - No. I think it's refreshing. Very European. But still, I'd like to know why-- - So, why don't you take your clothes off? - No, thanks. So, listen, about you living here, does the owner of the house know-- - The wicked, wicked boy. I wanna show you my latest masterpiece. Be careful! If you break my toys I'll get cross with you. They're delicate. But, most beautiful things are. You like it? - That's, that's good. Really, really good. - What kind of toy is that? - You're joking right? This isn't a toy, it's a very... Well, okay, I guess it's a toy. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, did you come here to play with me? - It's not like there's much else going on out there. Is that what you want? To play? - So badly. I mean it's so hard to find a proper playmate. - Oh man. This is weird. I mean, you're hot. Even if you're psychotic or something, you're definitely hot. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. But I'm here to investigate the house, okay? - Why don't you start with me? I'm part of this house. - No, that's not why I'm here. - You're here because there's a hunger deep inside you, and this is the only place that can satisfy it. I mean come on, if you think you're here for any other reason than that, then you're a fool. - God, this has got to be a dream. - This is what you want, isn't it? What you crave in every sweaty little fantasy that plays in your dirty little mind. I'm just here to oblige it. And if this is a dream, well I can think of worse ones to have. (guitars echoing) (breathing heavily) - Hey, ow, ow! What are you doing? Don't, come on I don't like this. Seriously, untie my hands! This is not funny, Cassandra. - (laughing) Oh, so my wicked boy likes to be in control, does he? - Yes, that's the issue, okay? I don't know you. You could be a serial killer or something, waiting to pull out a butcher knife or something. (knife tings) - Shit, shit no, come on, come on, put that away alright? - I know a game. Do you wanna play tic-tac-toe? - Listen, this isn't funny, this... Stop. - Shut up, okay? (laughs) (moaning) - You scared the living shit out of me. - God, I was just fucking with you. - It looks like... Looks like someone did get hurt though. - No! This one was my favorite, you destroyed it. - It's not like I could reach underneath and pull it out with my hands tied now could I? - You ruined it! - Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm very, very sorry. I'm sorry. Look, why don't we put some clothes on, and I'll introduce you to the other folks I'm with here. I know Stoker will wanna have a word with you. But we can eat, and figure out why you're here. You could go with me, if you like. When I leave here. - It just means so much to me. - I'll do anything to make it up to you. - Anything? - Yes. - Okay. I'm gonna lead you. Close your eyes, and let me surprise you with something. - Something good right? - Something very, very good. Something to take my mind off the toy. - Alright. But don't try to scare me again, I'm a professional. (loud banging) You fucking crazy bitch! I don't know what your story is, but I'm gonna radio the others and call the cops on you. You're trespassing! (loud roaring) (gasping) (gurgling) - You wicked boy. - Okay, summer campers, it's counselor Monks, just looking for a sound off. - This is Stoker. - Hey Monks. - This is Sturgeon, all is well. - This is Clegg man, everything's cool dude. - Yeah, this is Ketchum, leave me alone I'm trying to take a wiz. - Uh, this is Shelly, checking in. - Thanks guys, carry on. (knocking) - The fuck? - Are you ready? - Yeah. Can you linger this time? - Absolutely. (distant growling) (panting) - Oh, no. (sobbing) Ah. (moaning) No! (laughing) (screams) (gun cocking) - I thought you were gonna stay with me in here? - Sorry, slight change of plans. - What are you doing John? - What I have to do. What they want me to do. - Who are they, John? - They go by many names. Carnex, Carnivore from the Nexus, Succubi. That medallion is the key to their kingdom, and I want it Erin. Every time I've gotten this far with someone they invariably get killed before they find it. What did you see? - Monks, it's Erin. Stoker's gone crazy. He's threatening me with a gun. - He can't hear you Erin. The house has seen to that. (grunting) - [Voiceover] Monks, it's Erin. I'm heading to the control room, I have to talk to you. - Uh, okay Erin. - There you are. (gentle guitar) - Erin. Wow, that outfit. Wow. - I've been watching you, Monks. Watching you, watching me. You've wanted me for a long time, haven't you? - For as long as I can remember. Since the first time I met you. - So take me. (distant roaring) (death metal music) Fuck me harder! (panting) - Erin. Oh, shit. (laughing) Oh no. - I should've known. - What? - You're pathetic, you know that? I finally let a loser like you have the opportunity of a lifetime, and you blew it. - I was just a little excited. It's been a long time. Believe me, just give me a minute. - That's all you need isn't it? - Christ, you don't have to be so mean about it. - You are a little cock sucker, is that the problem Monks? Do you like the cock? - Stop talking to me like that, what is your problem? - I need a real man, that's my problem. Maybe Sturgeon or Clegg wants to have a go? We can fuck after I tell them what a disappointment you were. (roaring) (organs squishing) (loud high-pitched music) - Say, lover boy, I have an idea. Why don't I take you to meet the other girls? Why they'll just eat you up. (all growling) (breathing heavily) (loud ambient music) (breathing heavily) (screaming) (gun cocking) - I hope you had a nice nap. If you don't tell me what I want to hear, you'll be taking a much longer one very soon. - I don't know where the medallion is. - Yes you do. You just don't realize it. Tell me what you saw in the room, that's all I need to know. - And if I do, you won't kill me? - I won't kill you. You have my word. - Before I tell you, tell me something. Why? - I love them. And they love me. But there's more to it than that. We spend our entire lives wondering what lies beyond this bag of skin we wear. Those creatures are confirmation. Confirmation that more lies on the other side than we've ever dreamed possible. They've opened a door. And I intend to go through that door. But I need the medallion to completely control them. - And why haven't they killed you? - I give them what they need. I feed them. - And what do you get out of it? - They were beautiful women, who Fischer sacrificed and imbued with the spirit of the succubi. Do you really need to ask? - How many times have you done this? How many people have you led to slaughter? - I don't know. 30 or so since I bought the house. You see, I'm killing two birds with one stone. They won't show me exactly where the medallion is hidden, so I figured I'd hire some parapsychologists and psychics, none of them were the real deal. You have surpassed them all. - You are a fucking murderer. - I've never killed anyone, and I've never forced anyone to come into this house. - In my vision, I saw a huge painting. It was a painting of Fischer surrounded by three girls. - I know where that painting is, there's only one like it in the house. - So let me go. - Let you go? That wasn't the deal. I said I wouldn't kill you. I didn't say you wouldn't die. - Well hello there. I'm Irene. Haven't seen you here before. I've seen many a man in this place, and I never forget them. Their faces, their musk, their taste. Don't say much do you? That's okay, I like the strong silent type. As a matter of fact, I like any type. Tell me, what type do you like? You like the demure heroine? The harsh mistress? The back alley whore? The neighbor's wife? The distant cousin? My you're a bashful one aren't you? Well, don't be shy, tell Irene all your dirty little longings. I promise you I'll like them, and I can indulge every one of them. Maybe you just like to watch. Is that the case? Do you like this body? Do you want to touch me? Taste me? Explore every inch of me. I'd like to taste you. - So uh... Are you a friend of Stoker's? (laughs) - You could say that. Stoker and I go way back. I met him when he first bought the house. I was the first one to welcome him. And I'd like to welcome you as well. - Do you live here? Cause, he never said anything about anybody living here. - Oh, must have slipped his mind. Such a big house, and poor Stoker has so much on his mind. - You're not his girlfriend are you? - No. I don't have a boyfriend. Would you like to be my boyfriend? - Uh, I... Well... Hey, you're not one of those, you know, crazy people he was talking about are you? - Now why would you say that? - Oh I don't know, I mean... You're naked and touching yourself in front of me. I mean, it's totally cool, I just, it's not usually an ice breaker, that's all. - Silly boy. Don't you know when a girl's just trying to get your attention? - No, not really. (soft guitar) (death metal music) - Come on. Come on, fuck me. (laughing) - I can't believe this. You are so fucking hot. - Harder. Harder, harder! - What the fuck? Don't do that you crazy bitch! - (laughing) That's right, that's right. Crazy bitch, you're a crazy bitch. Now split me in half. Come on you little runt! - God damn it, don't fucking do that again! - Lay back and enjoy the ride pretty boy. (roaring) (yelps) (screaming) (blood dripping) - Those are my girls. As deadly as they are beautiful. (cane tapping on floor) (laughing) (crunching and squishing) (screams) (roaring) - Aw, look at the little birdy. Can we play with it before we rip its wings off? - The way she stares at me. She's undressing me with her eyes. She wants to ravish me, I can tell. - I love saving the prettiest for last. - It's been so long since we've had company. And even longer since a proper meal. - You tend to your hunger, Cassandra, and I'll tend to mine. - What are you? - Famished, darling. - Let's just put the poor thing out of her misery. (all laughing) - Get the fuck away from me! - We thought that might bring you to your senses. Welcome home. (eerie ambient noise) (laughing) - I am so impressed with you. Everyone else, wiped out. But you, you're a survivor. You know I hate to trip you up this close to the finish line kid, but I can't very well leave any witnesses, can I? By the way, that gown looks lovely on you. It's a perfect choice for the grand finale of tonight's little drama. - Just do whatever it is you're going to do. I'm tired, and I don't wanna stare at your fucking face anymore. - You're right. We should get this over with, I'm looking forward to spending a little quality time with the girls. Kill her. (roaring) - Why would they kill one of their own? - Hey! Why would you do this to me? We had a deal! I've given you everything you've ever asked for! - You broke our only rule! - Well I wasn't gonna hurt you with it! - No, you were going to do worse. You were going to control us with it. - Well you forgot something, Stoker. That's why Erin came back. To set things right. - Erin? - You didn't honestly think we were all trapped in here now did you? - All along, you knew. - And now I know why. Feels so good to be in the old place. In the old flesh. We do have to do something about that bothersome medallion though, don't we? - Yes, absolutely, let's destroy it! That is why I sought it out after all, to protect you. You didn't honestly think I was gonna use it against you? Let's destroy it and I'll have a fresh crop of people in here in no time! More than ever before, now that we have an extra mouth to feed. - Unfortunately the medallion can't be destroyed. But I know the next best thing. We'll put it somewhere for safe keeping. The usual place. Oh, John, we're gonna need your help for this. And you'd love to help us wouldn't you? - Of course, I live to serve you all. (loud shrieking) (death metal music) (laughing) (loud grunting and roaring) - Think we'll be waiting long for others to come? I'm hungry. - Such an appetite for such a slight thing. - I'm a growing girl. - It's always so lonely here. - There's enough greed and lust in the hearts of men to keep our doors open for a very long time. Others will come. (gloomy ambient music) - [Voiceover] Flesh for the beast. (death metal music)
