I reread your letters. You write about us. About all the beauty you've forgotten. All you've lost. You ask me what remains. For me, memories remain, scattered, poorly sorted moments and places to revisit. TERRITORY OF LOVE - You're abandoning me. - No ! Keep going... Go on. It's there. Just stop there. I love you ! There. What's this about a Dutch agency ? Why not be a French guide ? I'm not going to speak French, Mom. Are you going to speak Chinese or Dutch ? - I thought it was for your novel. - I'll tell you later. I love you ! Carpe diem ! Yeah, yeah. There are about 375 temples which celebrate Mazu in Taiwan. This temple is one of the oldest in Taiwan and is also the oldest one in Kaohsiung. The architecture is derived from a style from the South, which comprises two halls, five doors and two halls for the guards. What are they doing ? They're praying. And what's he doing ? No idea. - OK ? - Yes. All these colors are magnificent. - Is it really old ? - No. The building dates back to 1910. It was built in memory of the soldiers. Can we go in ? Yes, of course. Hi ! - I meet you everywhere. - Yeah. Yeah, I saw you at the temple. Where are you from ? From the Netherlands. But you sound French. Where are you from exactly ? Groningen. "Nice to meet you. How are you ?" Fine, thanks. You speak Dutch ? Well, that's all I can say. It's similar to German though, it must be easy to learn. Why come to Asia to speak English ? Sorry ? You don't speak Mandarin ? I think it's your tones, I can't really understand you. How long have you been learning for ? Sixth months. Well, in a year's time you'll start to pick up the various tones. - You'll see. - OK. So ? What ? Well, now is when you're meant to ask me what I'm doing this evening. - Evenings are complicated for me. - Do you have a girlfriend ? No, no. But I've either got basketball or studying my languages. Too bad. Wait. I should be able to find some time on the weekend. Some tourists are looking for their guide. Is it you ? Can you say it again more slowly, please ? Some tourists are lost. It's my group. They're for me. Thank you for coming to find me. You were bullshiting me ! You're Mandarin is better than mine. I told you it's your accent. You're not emphasizing the tones. I can tell you're French ! Bye. What's it about ? It's an account of survival, solitude, nature. Kind of "Into the Wild" in Taiwan in the 19th century. About a man who gets lost on a mountain. Oh, it's your foot. Is it your first novel ? That depends. I started lots, but it's the first I'll finish. It makes me think of a great book I'm reading about Xueshan mountain. I have it at home. OK. - What ? - Let's go. What is this place ? I rent it off a Portuguese guy who rents it off a Russian. - Mind if I use the bathroom ? - No. Don't touch the globe. It changes the speed. You share this place ? Your roommates are like the Tower of Babel ! Why ? Whose are these books ? Mine. No, the others. The Hindi, Arabic... Whose are they ? Mine. How many languages do you speak ? It depends how you count. Properly: only 14. 4 or 5 I can chat in. 3 I have a smattering of. 2 are dead languages, so I don't speak them. You're shitting me ! No, why ? What can you speak ? Well, actually... I'm not good at languages. Take care of it. I have to return it next week. Don't worry. - OK, then... - OK, what ? I have to study. I have to do 3 hours of Mandarin a day. You'll work now ? Well... yeah. Why did you ask me up ? For the book. OK. Well, I'll see you tomorrow ? OK. Get home safe. What are you doing ? Tidying some Mandarin away. Be serious ! Don't you know the places method ? The kingdom of memory ? No, what is it ? Close your eyes. Where are we ? - Kaohsiung memorial. - Yes. Can you picture it ? - Meaning ? - Close your eyes. We'll move forward. What is there... 50 meters behind us ? - The entrance. - Yes. What's in front of us on the steps ? - The columns. - How many ? 6... No, 8. Correct. See ? The place is in your memory. So, what about Mandarin ? It's our capacity to memorize places and use it to remember data. I don't understand. Well... You visualize a place in your mind. Then, you stock, say, vocabulary, lists, numbers... Then, you walk around your mind... OK ? And the more you walk, the more the things are recorded in your memory. At first, you use simple places. Later, you can build streets and towns. Entire kingdoms to store your memories. Let me try. Come... For example... English... is in my childhood room. Mandarin: here. German: in high school. Polish: in junior high. Etc. You should've brought it three days ago. Oh, I forgot it. The library can wait. I'll get a fine. Are you listening ? Do you want some ? Yeah. - And you ? - Thank you. I can't think. I can't even write. I need a routine. So, I suggest we get organized and have a fuck. - Want some water ? - No, thanks, I'm OK. But we don't sleep together. I need a good night's sleep. OK ? Is the tea tasting today ? Yes, at 4. OK with you ? What did she say ? I don't understand. It's up to you. Get your book, have a drink, then go. Olivier, if you don't want to, I won't rape you ! Broca's area concerns speech functions. It's the part of the brain which lets you produce words. If your nose is France... Well... it's somewhere between Kazakhstan and Turkey. Here. Whereas the comprehension of these words is elsewhere. It's... here. It's Wernicke's area. It's China. It communicates with Broca's area. I didn't do a thing. What now ? I think I love you, Maria. I... What time is it ? I have to go to bed. Go home, then. I start at 8 AM. So ? I live an hour away. You live 200 meters away. Come in my bed, but not to sleep. And what about your sofa ? You won't sleep in that. It was our first night together. The worst night of my life. And the best. I've forgotten nothing of that night, none of my dreams. You left late in the morning, without waking me. You left me a note. You said you'd end up surrendering. And you did end up surrendering. ONE YEAR LATER An apple. One. An apple. A pear. Give me food. I made a flask of coffee for you. Thank you. Can't you wake up at a normal time ? 4 is a normal time for me. Why do pull-ups for a trek ? Work your legs. Don't start. Must you go to Xueshan to finish your book ? Don't you have a group at the temple ? Shit ! Bedroom ? - Bathroom ! - Bathroom. I love you, darling. See you later. Bye ! Your laces ! I'll do that later. Thanks ! Is that all ? I love reading your words. Getting inside your head. What ? Not just inside my head ! Bathroom ? - Bedroom ? - Bedroom. What ? You're handsome. It's too big. Is that too big ? Gotta go ! I love you, darling ! Bye ! What'll we do ? Do we want to go back ? I don't know. If I go back pregnant, we have 4 months to pack. Are you in your mind kingdom ? Sorry. I don't know what's wrong. Well, you learn words instead of doing normal stuff like sleeping. I love you. So, what do we do ? Olivier, are you OK ? Maria... Marry me. Take another ibuprofen. Maria, do you want to be my wife ? Don't ever tell me you're an anarchist ! We're fine. Why make promises we can't keep ? What time is the blood test ? The French doc can't do it. I'll go after the trek. And the German doctor that the agency mentioned ? You have time tomorrow before the bus. Are you annoyed ? Why won't they give the results on the phone ? Please, have a seat. We're kind of in a hurry, we leave in a treck in two hours and our tickets aren't refoundable. Please, sit down. This won't be an easy conversation. The white blood cell count is too high. It can't be an infection... - And... it's more. - More, more what ? Tell me what it is. I'm not able to make a precise diagnosis here. You should go to a hematology department. Can't it wait till we get back from our treck ? Oký What your friend has is serious. His white blood cell count is increasing by the hour. Soon, he won't be able to catch a plane. Soon like when ? Can't we do tests in Taipei, then, decide ? Strasbourg has one of the best hematology centers in Europe. Go back to France. Today. Now. "Crown." "Cro-wn." ...suppression of the famous labor law. Jean-Luc Mélenchon was against it. Please, turn it down. He needs to sleep. I'm interested in this. The left will win. - Nonsense. - You'll see. He'll be in the second round. Turn it up, Dad. Once elected, Mélenchon promises to set up an assembly... Dad has organized everything with the hospital, right, dear ? You can stay in the apartment. It's near our home. It's my office. The old Peugeot is in the basement. Feel free to use it. We'll sleep at home. Maria is returning to Taiwan to write. OK ? Mr. Olivier Maynial. You won't all fit in the office. Only 1 person with the patient. Excuse me. You choose who you want with you. What do I do ? Up to you. Success rate ? We now have very effective treatments. 50% success... We'd rather not give you a figure. We can't be sure. The first treatment starts today. Do you want children ? Yes. Not just yet. But yes. The radiation makes you sterile. Bank your sperm first. Bank it ? Here it is. It's a bit small, but comfortable. I'll move the boxes. Here you are. Thanks. Here. It's heaven here ! I have my books, bed and board. You visit. And lots of women look after you ! Yeah. Visiting hours are over. I must attend to him. I'll be going. Get out of here ! Go to Xueshan. Write 3 hours a day. Your method doesn't work for me. Exactly. That's why you must go back to Taiwan. Go in the mountains. Find inspiration and write. - Miss... - OK. Maria... Come here. Give me your hand. You'll get an infection. I don't care. Go on, give me your hand. In the bedroom... or the bedroom ? Idiot ! I want you, too. I love you. Olivier... Don't say anything. Stay the same. Stay beautiful. And fresh. You're not saying goodbye ? No. But I can feel I'm falling. I don't want you to fall with me. Sorry for meeting you, Maria. I'm sorry. Miss Pierre ? Hello. Block B ? Let's go this way. It's a bad idea to go back to Asia now. Olivier is responding well to treatment, but I think it's because you're here. The drugs work better, because I'm here ? You can't say that. You're his best treatment. I can't work. I'm spending all my savings. How can I really be useful ? Love him. Cut the Catholic crap ! Answer me as a doctor. It's a rare form of leukemia. We've only treated 5 cases in 40 years. How many lived ? The doc says I have more effect than the drugs. He believes in certain things. What do you believe in ? I believe in balance. Meaning ? Chinese medicine is different. I won't discuss it here. It drives the other doctors crazy. OK, will you stop throwing it ? Why ? It's sturdy. If you were me... would you go back to Taiwan or stay here ? I don't know, Maria. If you were in my shoes ? I've never had a boyfriend to avoid being in your shoes. But if you were ? Well... I'd rather travel. Stop the bus ! I want to get out. - Calm down. - Stop ! Calm down. - What's wrong ? - He's OK. It's alright. Fuck. Fuck ! - Yes ? - Maria... Olivier is in a coma. We're waiting for news. We don't know any more yet. He's squeezing my hand. His fingers can't move. He's squeezing my hand. See that ? He is. I can feel you. Keep squeezing. OK, can you start tomorrow ? Yes. What a mess. Is it a demonstration ? No, it's a far right rally. There's gridlock. Everyone is late for work. Will you be on time tomorrow ? Of course I will. 'Evening. - Was your work OK ? - Yes. How was your day ? Nothing interesting. Did you hear that ? He made a sound. Olivier... I think he said my name. Maria, we're all tired. Say it again. - Maria... - Olivier ! You still have room in your well-organized brain for one word ! - Calm down. - I am calm. I'm trying to... Maria... Is anyone here ? Nurse, please ! I'm proud of you. Well done. Hello ? Hello, it's the doctor's secretary. - Mrs. Pierre ? - Speaking. The doctors wish to talk to you and the family. Can you come ? Has he come round ? I don't know. The doctors will tell you. I'm on my way. Is he dead ? No. Sit down, Maria. How is he ? This morning, Olivier went into a deep coma. What ? He said my name yesterday. We will stop the treatment. Especially the immunosuppressants. We won't let him suffer, but we'll stop the rest. I can't do any more. I'm sorry. What'll happen in the best-case scenario ? There's no best-case scenario. Olivier will sink into a deeper coma, then I'm afraid that all we can hope for is that he dies a natural death. But... this is crazy. He reacted yesterday. You won't get any reaction now. Squeeze my hand. Squeeze it. I know you can hear me. Squeeze it. Olivier... It's me. Squeeze my hand. Squeeze it. Maria... Wake up. I need you. I'm starting to write. You have to read it. You must help me. Maria... They were just reflex movements. He won't react anymore. React or the far right will win. Is that just a reflex ? Automatic socialism ?! Give him two more weeks. We can give him two weeks. But even if he comes round... we'd need three miracles. That the rejection stops, he makes platelets, and the cerebral lesions diminish. The lesions in the brain can't diminish. Three miracles, Maria. Isn't that a bit much ? "He was above 2,000 meters. The altitude burned his lungs. He could see Xueshan in the distance. Still no sign of supplies. He was eating his last provisions. He knew it only too well." When are those results from ? For you. OK, I'm coming. Without really saying it, we each said our goodbyes. Our biggest fear was for you to die on your own in the night. Let's stimulate your nervous system. Baking, baked, baked. Start, started, started. Breath, own, own, eat, eat, drink. Fly, flew, flown, forsee, forsaw, forseen. I love you. Maria... Maria. Olivier, Olivier ? Olivier ! My love ! My darling. Where are my car keys ? What ? My car keys... where are they ? You bastard ! I've been crying my eyes out, and you want your car keys ! I have to move my Porsche. Olivier, it's not funny. I have to register my Porsche... my Porsche here. This is a hospital. Do you see ? I do... I do not understand. Where are we ? We're in a hospital. You were in a coma. I don't understand a word. Talk normally. The scans show the cerebral lesions have diminished. You're jumping for joy, aren't you ? Olivier is a scientific exception. Hear that, my love ? We'll resume all the treatment. OK. Goodbye, sir. We'll organize the transfer this afternoon. Aren't we lucky ? - You can see it's not snow. - I can't. Yes, you're in a bed. Yes, in Canada. No, in the hospital in Strasbourg. Nonsense ! What do you see there ? Strasbourg cathedral. So ? My darling, that's a fake ! It's like the Eiffel Tower. - They're in Tokyo, Los Angeles... - No. They're everywhere. Did you ever see Strasbourg cathedral anywhere else ? Maria, you can see it's not real. It's tiny. Because it's far away. Remember I'm writing a book ? Do you still want to read it ? Do you or not ? Yes, my darling. Until you come back to France, I won't write a thing. OK. I want you to become the man you were. You're beautiful, darling ! Think so ? Julien looks great, too. Yes, he looks great. Really great. - Laureen, where's the chair ? - What chair ? The wheelchair. Julien didn't want it in the car. My brother will bring it. - Are you staying ? - Just for the reception. Why does he keep looking at me ? Julien's old colleague. He kept asking about you. I said you were madly in love. Like me ! See you later. - Look at this... - Let's go. No, let's party ! We'll have fun ! 'Evening. - How about a dance ? - No, thanks. Come on ! Time for a dance medley. I want everyone dancing ! You can't say no to that ! Now something more rock'n'roll ! Let's go, baby ! Come on. Help me. We gotta go. - The party's in full swing. - I know. Who said "Carpe diem" ? That was before. The world hasn't changed since. It has. Enough of your stupid fidelity and hypocrisy ! Enjoy tonight. You're a long time dead ! What'll you do ? Give me the keys. I'm thinking. Pass your test first ! - Mom, the keys. - Think it over. What can I say ? You're throwing your life away for something that's gone. He's stuck in Canada. You talk to him like you're his mother. Did you hear me ? Yeah. Bedroom ? Bedroom ? What ? What are you doing ? Never mind. We'll try again. We'll go back to normal. Here in Canada ? "We dream we are banqueting. At dawn, we weep. The next day, we go hunting. In our dream, we explain another dream. Only fools think they are awake. They are certain of it. Princes, herdsmen... All certain of it. I say you're dreaming. I'm just a dream, too." Say goodbye, sweetie. You won't ? - Thanks for coming. - We'll come again. It's good he saw you. - Maria ? - Yeah ? What did you do with our baby ? We don't have one, honey. What are you talking about ? Of course we have a baby. No. Who's Léa, then ? Your cousin's daughter. Where is our baby ? We don't have a baby. You were pregnant. Weren't you ? We didn't keep it. We decided not to keep it. Why ? Why'd we do that ? Because... Because we were scared. Here. - OK, son, sleep well ? - Yes. OK, honey ? I don't know. The bedroom... What about the bedroom ? I don't know. I thought... I was in Canada. Where are we ? In Strasbourg. Where ? In Strasbourg, at my parents'. Why ? OK, honey ? Yes ! Just fine ! Very good. The lighter the treatment, the better. Any mark on the skin, come back at once. It's a sign of another rejection. To your wedding ! And your travels. To the new year ! To Canada ! I'm joking ! Smart-ass ! - Is that half ? - Yes. I made a flask of coffee for you. Really ? Sure, why ? Bedroom ? Is there another option here ? Prefer the bicycle shed ? No. The bedroom is great ! The bedroom is great. Hang on. Hang on, honey. I can't... Here. How's the new drug ? We've stopped the rejection. The readings have gone up. That's good. How's the diarrhea ? No better ? He doesn't make it in time. Too fuckin' right. Will it go back to normal ? I don't know, but the neurological after-effects of the treatment aren't known or logical. It doesn't make any sense. Some things come back such as reading, which is great, others don't, and there's no logic to it. A faculty can come back, without improving his incontinence issues, for example. You see ? Olivier... Can you tell me which country we're in now ? I don't know. Do you like the dresses ? They're great. I like the red one. Are you taking that one ? I'll take them all. I'm just renting, Mom. How will you bring them back ? I won't. It's a package, with the photo session. We just keep the photos. I see. How's Olivier doing ? Fine. He's fine. Stop it, honey. Don't touch. So, everything's OK, is it ? Everything's OK ? - He still has accidents... - Don't touch. That's all. What's that ? And his head ? How's his head ? Really great. Fuck, shit. Remember this ? - C'mon, Maria ! - Stop it, Olivier. - C'mon. - Wait. Just 2 minutes, OK ? Shit, fuck ! What is it ? Get in here. Hurry up ! Take it off. Take it all off. Is everything OK, miss ? Yes ! How is it ? Are you alright ? One moment, I'm not ready. Here. Do you need any help ? I'm OK, I... I just... I just need 2 minutes. You don't have a dog, do you ? No. Okay. Are you OK, honey ? Okay. We're gonna run. OK ? Olivier ? Olivier ! You've reached Olivier's voicemail. You've reached Olivier's voicemail. Hey, are you OK ? Where are you ? I don't know. Fuck. What can you see ? There's a 7-Eleven. What else ? Which street ? I don't know. Are you... What's that ? What ? Who's crying ? Why is a baby crying ? I don't know. Where's the baby ? In my arms. Why ? I don't fuckin' know ! Don't move. Find a sign and read it. There's a 7-Eleven. Did you walk far ? I forget. Give someone the phone. - Who to ? - Give it to anyone. There's no-one. Oh, hang on. Excuse me, ma'am. Can you take this ? Ask calmly in Chinese. I can't speak Chinese. Yes, you can. Just say... Where are we ? Where are we ? Still near the 7-Eleven ? Have you seen a tall European ? - He just went past. - Thanks. Fuck ! Fuck ! Come to me. Where was she ? I don't know, she was lost. Where ? I don't know. Come on. Was it here ? Look, she's happy. Don't ever go off like that ! It's not her fault. You let her out of your sight ! - What's it to you ? - It's not her fault ! - Who do you think you are ? - You can't talk to me like this ! - Who are you ? - Don't yell ! How could I not ? Are you OK ? Maria... Yeah ? I'd have taken good care of our baby, you know ? Yes, I know. I'd never have damaged it. I know that, too. Fuckin' pain ! Fuckin' pain in the ass ! Stop it. Pain in the ass ! I can't take any more ! I'm sick of it ! Why are you with me ? Why am I a shit ? Why are you with me ? I'm worthless. I'm shit. Why are you with me ? No, not that ! Give it to me ! I'm sorry. Shit ! - I wanna die. I wanna die. - Stop ! - I wanna die ! I wanna die ! - Stop ! Stop it ! Stop ! Get up. Get up. Get up, dammit ! Get up ! I'm going to leave, Olivier. I can't stay with you anymore. Olivier... I got your letter today. I didn't understand it all. You mix your life with your parents, your treatment, the trips you're making again... You write about us. About all the beauty you'd like to remember. You talk of politics, a stay in a psychiatric hospital, your speech therapist whose address you spell out in full. You tell me how happy you are. You write "happy" in capitals. Olivier, I don't know what you remember about us. As for me, I remember everything. I'm closing this notebook. I've finally written something which means a lot to me. You're here, somewhere in my memories. You're the man I lost. Despite it all, you're alive. Still standing. We made it.
