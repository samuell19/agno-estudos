Come. Map of Australia. Hey, Bodhi! Brice-sket! - Hey, what's waxin'? - Hey, just relaxin'. - Ready to axe? - To the max! Bend your legs as if pissing in a fish tank. North Pole to South Pole, cruise control. And you axe, and you axe... The return axe. And you axe and you axe... The double-axe! And you axe and you axe... Now for the climax: Baby Axe. Baby Axe, Baby Axe... Dude, you can really axe! Yeah, I know. Over and over. Catch your wave, Brice! What's waxin'? Just relaxin'! Move over. You're in my way. That hurts. Watch out! Pain in the ass. What do I do now? I can't make it through. - Hey, Brice! - Bee Gees, what's waxin'?! Staying alive? - Hey Brice. - How's life, Vero-nice? Better when I see you. Meet my cousin. Hello. - Hey. - Marjorie. It's not your fault. Pretty smile. Pretty smell. Thanks. - Here on vacation? - Since yesterday. How often did I say not to park here? 3 or 4 times. Now makes 5. - Honey bunny! - Hey there, Josie. You okay? - And your wave? - Not today. No swells. Wind's ashore. Total bore. Tonight we mellow yellow. - What? - It's a rhyme. No kidding. Just like "white nights". Except yellow. My place, tonight. Open bar, high times, panties optional, don't be rational. Mull it over. Surfz up. See you tonight. - Bumbye. - Bye, baby. After I axe the air and diss people, I feel cleansed. It's Nirvana. - You have surfers in Nice? - One... just one. Mario, I'm throwing a Yellow. Would you like... not to come? Axed! Get lost. Bodhi... My buddy... Mama... I'm not scared. Wind and waves. That's Bodhi. They call him the Bodhisatva. He's a modern savage. He's a real searcher. - In search of what? - The Ride. The ultimate ride. Hey Kevin, what's waxin'? Brought your mom? Hey, Whiskers. I'd ride your wave tonight. I mean it. Yellow? It's wild as hell. Who is this? You're missing something special. Birdie num-num. I didn't invite you, that's why. I have to go. You're boring me. Ciao for now... Bumbye. Naomi, you're so ugly. What's wrong? - It's Chris. - What about him? He stopped loving me. Come on, that's ridiculous. He never loved you in the first place. Axed! What do you care about Chris? I love him! Grow up! - Want a drink? - I don't know. Have fun! Chill out! Go with the flow! Do a puzzle. A puzzle of me. I'm going out. Yes, Dad. The caterer's check is locked in my desk. Get an itemized bill for tax purposes. In my name. And no one in my office, okay? Get the check. Get the bill. Give the keys back to Melina. Understood? Repeat. I take the check... no, the keys or else no checks. Take the checks, the keys, the cheese. The keys to Melina's desk... no, your desk. I take Melina's checks... No, I take the keys... - Here. - I take that. Much better. Just what I need. Cool. Where are you having dinner? Pretty girl. Night, Dad. Have a great time. Go for the gold! None of them are on the guest list. What do we do? Ask a pro. What are you, my fan club? You can go in. You too. Hot stuff. You're in. Not you. No way. You're in. Dance for me. Shake your booty! Shake it! Forget it. I can boogie! Watch this! Watch me move... Move back. Keep on moving. You go in... Stop! Change of plans. I like you better. You're gorgeous. But one of you is a dog. Thanks. Live with your parents? Yeah... with my dad. - That's gross. - It is not! - And your mom? - Mom? Mom's the Big Blue. Jeez, just look at her. Gentle, calm, not a ripple. Us surfers call a smooth ocean "glassy. " But for me... it's glassy. I use the same word. I was wondering... What kind of waves do you have in Nice? You're interested? I'd call it... my kind of wave. The kind you can't refuse. The kind you gotta use. The kind of wave, when you see it, you can only say, "Like wow!" I haven't found the right words. I'm still writing. I amaze you. Let's talk about me. Aren't you glad you know me? Go on, be honest. Later, beauty. I have a duty. Axed! Yeah. Things can get axed too. - Axe attacks! - For you. - Axe attacks! - For me. - Axe attacks! - I'm bad. - Axe attacks! - I'm mad. - Axe attacks! - I love it! - Axe your ass! - Go shove it! Losers first. Go on. Shoot your load. "King of Diss"! Don't your yellow nights make you... "King of Piss"? Hide your balls. Axed! False start. Let's start over. - Hello. - No, Yellow. A real player. White. Black. - Proton. - Neutron. - Spank me. - Wank me. - Sink. - Swim. Holy shit. Your face doesn't go with your body. Your turn. Axe me! Axe me! Axed. He thinks he's a bruiser. He's really just a loser. All he can say is "Axe, axe, axe"! When he whacks his axe, he squirts on his shirts. Huh. - What? - I'm bored. Axed! Next. Who found them? Hawaii has two I's. One's useless, like you! - My compliments. - Accepted. I need to change. Coming? Grab the kimonos. Garden hose. Don't touch my toys. Mega-Tube on the Riviera. What's a Mega-Tube? A Mega-Tube? A huge wave. One hit the coast in '79. From Nice to Antibes. I just missed it. I was only 5. But believe me, the next one... What's this? Hands off. It's a good-luck charm. It's a real shark tooth made of natural plastic. I see. Sorry. This one's yours. Point Break? Watch this! That's Bodhi! See him? Backside in the tube, then a floater on the rim. I'm the king of the world! I'm God! You've got it inside you. You're a pit-bull. You didn't hesitate. That's very rare. - Thanks a lot. - De nada. You're a pit-bull. Come... Map of New Zealand. Hey, Bodhi! You farted last night. Call you later. Hello! What's waxin? Just relaxin'! You can't park here! Move it! Dad! The girl's screaming. - You know what they did? - Your son? They trashed the house without even asking. He knows nothing. - Handcuff him. - He knows nothing! Stop! He never saw or heard a thing. He knows nothing because he's a total moron. Look at him! Can't you tell he's a moron? We'll call you. This way... What will become of us? It'll be fine. Not on my T-shirt... "Agostini "has been accused of laundering money "for the Sicilian mafia "in diverse establishments on the Riviera "as well as in off-shore companies "based in the Ca... Cayman Islands. " Jeez... Way over my head. How's Daddy? Josie, something strong. - Scotch? Cognac? - Root beer. "Diverse establishments... " Must be tough. - Lay off him. - Yeah. Sylvain! Christian! Joe! We were leaving... Later. ALL ALONE Enough. Leave him alone. So long. Melina! How pathetic! It's time to rock and roll! Everybody, freeze. Hands up, eyes down! Onto the floor! Got ear wax? We're the ex-Presidents. We need just a few moments. We've been screwing you for years... So? What's your next move? Dunno... You have no family? Guess you'll have to work. Josie... Can I pay you later? At the moment I'm... tanning. A friend of mine has a restaurant near Antibes. Should I give him a call? What is it like... to work? I mean, I know the word but... I have a friend who works but... I'm clueless. Everybody, freeze! Hands up, eyes down! Your attention, please! We are the ex-Presidents. As you can see, we're robbing your bank. Cooperate and I won't blow your heads off!

Seaweed in your armpits! It works with mermaids too. - Dickhead. - At least I have legs. Axed! - I'm axed? - Totally. - I'm outta here. - Beat it!

The remote control? Thanks. Thanks a lot. Asshole. Keep it nice. We never rode a wave together. - Where are we? - By the way... My motorcycle... Why did you grab the... Tell me. Oh, the biker. Are you retarded or do you like riding into walls? What? You can't even talk. Enough. No way! - You sleep with shoes on? - So what? What's it to you? - Brice Agostini? - That's me. Eudes Angellini. You're a total pig. No, your father's lawyer. - He sent me. - How Dad? - Dad's in prison. - In prison! Like a prisoner. Why do you have your shoes on? - Tell me where we are. - A hospital. Yeah, a hot-spittle. And what's in hot-spittles? Tons of germs. They multiply on the floor and they... You're clueless! You're charged with assault and battery, attempted robbery - and skateboard theft. - I borrowed that! Concentrate: hospitals kill disease. You know... you... people like you... you may leave cured. Right? You sing. But the germs on the floor... They set up house... They pop out! And grab you by your feet. Just bear it in mind! Any chance of changing rooms? Change lawyers too. No, stay! Me! I need... one of you. Because my scooter... You stole it, right? Sort of. Marius Le Quail. Like the bird. My pleasure. Listen up, I'm forced to take you as my client, so sign these documents or get by without me. - Why? - Because I'm busy! He kills you. Are you signing? I'm due in court. Shut up. Know what? Come back tomorrow. Do you understand me? Come back tomorrow and bring us presents. Yes, sir. If you don't mind. Will that be all? You're a real pit-bull. High five! They're comfortable. My feet sure are swollen! Everyone needs good shoes! I couldn't wear them on duty. So get a pair for the house. Surfz up. I'm in a rush. I've always been a fan of Dr. Scholl. - What if I missed it? - Missed what? - My wave. - What wave? My wave... Forget it, landshark. What? Okay. Have you seen Pointbreak? Yeah, in concert. The movie, with Patrick Swayze. Never saw Pointbreak? Nope. Missed that too. - Pathetic. - What? Everything's in Pointbreak. Everything. When you see it, you become bilingual in surf. Get it? You're a surfer. That's why you look so... so nasty. Sure I know Scholls. What are you doing? They're surfers! Holy shit! What a ride! What an ass! - Police? - Surfz up. I got hit by two dickheads in beds. Don't tell. Phone call for you. You surf for real? I'm the best. Give me the phone. - Who are you calling? - Hold the stone. - Hello? - Hello, yes? Nothing! That's taken care of. Who are you calling? How did you get out? You bring my stuff? Is that your vehicle? My wife's. Get in, please. Catch you later. Did you hear him? We have to go. The sea is calling. I'm taking you and you, back to the hospital. I'm not laughing, dude. Hands off. There are no waves. Look. Tell him Nice is wave-less. Forget about sports. What? Sports? It's not a sport, it's a dream! - You have no dream? - I had one, once... He doesn't have a dream! - I had one. - We don't care. No pie in the sky? No burning urge? You won't catch waves here. You'll just get caught. My car! My axe is all rusty. Bodhi, where are you? I need water... - Snack-time! - Where's the ocean? - How far is Nice? - In kilo-miles? Ten, fifteen... twenty. I can't breathe. My solar plexus hurts. Come on, eat. It's good for... Eat and we'll go. - We have to go. - I'm not going, Marius. I can't leave Nice. I can't. I'm still waiting for my wave. It's better for friends... - to stick together. - I have no friends. Sorry, I'm going back to Nice. Bumbye. Yeah, run on home. Go back to Nice. You'll see what you're in for. They'll love you in jail with your wavy, blond hair. For a jailbird like you, this is fun! Don't tease me! Because my life hasn't been... I never had anything! I had everything! And I'm in as deep shit as you, if not deeper. Yeah, go on. Run on home! Surfer girl! Scoot over. I'm driving. This isn't the way! Change of plans. Why do you need me? To dream. I can dream too, can't I? Who hijacked my scooter? Me? Now you follow me. Where to? Can I help you? Is this the real McCoy? I mean... "La plancha"? Miss! Just a sec. Is this the right size? You can wear it even lower. - Is it Basque? - Local. Are you here for the Cup? - What cup? - You're not a surfer? Sure I am. - Where are we? - At the spot, dude? - The spot? - You're in Hossegor. Hossegor? - Victor, how's the swell? - Great. It's moving in. I have a surprise. Pick a hand... - That one. - Wrong! It's the other one. It's a present. For you. It's yellow. Where did you get it? - You like it? - Yeah, totally. It's gorgeous. 100,000 dollars. Better than the tooth fairy. It's simple. First, you win, then you give me half. You win 100,000. 50,000 for you and 50,000 for me. I'll pay you back... when I can... if I can. Marius... I didn't do it! It's me! It's Brice! I can't do it. Why are you whispering? I can't do it. What? What? Why not? It's hard to explain. You can't let me down. Not now. You told me I needed a dream. I have one. And I need you. What's your dream? I can't say it. You'll tease me. - Go on, tell me. - No is no. Then I won't surf. Okay. Feet. What? Feet. Feet? It's not that hard to understand the meaning of "feet". Surfz down, dude. I'm lost. Two nice feet. Like a Greek statue. Size 9. With beautiful... like in a church... arches! Look. The man in Rio. He's... no mere doctor! He's a Professor. He can take a muscle and a piece of bone and make a finger! With a real fingernail! He can give you brand new feet. He takes the Achille's... - The Achilles' tendon. - Yeah, that. He pastes the tendon to a bone. In 6 months, you're walking. Fresh air time. Okay. Look. Holy cow! How do you wear thongs? Are you a mutant? From another planet, right? With a message for me. Are you taking me away? Understand? You know what this means? Laugh. I laugh too when I see them. - They don't hurt? - No, look. Pretty cool. Know any other tricks? But it's useless. You know, they look like... Don't be offended. I respect you and your feet. They look like coffee ?clairs. Axed! You totally axed me. I've never undressed in front of a girl. What you're asking me is to win... so you can get your feet cut off. Not cut off. Pasted on. - You're wacko. - I'm not wacko. What's crazier? Tube-hunting in Nice or wanting new feet? A mega-tube already happened in Nice. Foot transplants happen too. What if they screw up? What if you drown? Surf! Surf! Surf for me! Surf, surf, surf for me. Surf, Brice! Brice, surf for me! Go on and surf! Pay the price, Brice, of Paradise. Surf for me, let me see Don't lose, I want real shoes! Winds ashore, total bore. Is this what you want? Hop a wave and steer I'll manage your career Do the Brice Boogie! Help redeem A pal with a dream I'll make the sacrifice. Call me Jesus Brice Go on and surf Surf for me Go on and sign for me, Go on, sign Sign for me Sign on the X? I'll give you the axe If you compete, I get feet. Mama Blue, where are you? The day train leaves Biarritz at 7:15 and arrives in Nice at 19:15. The night train leaves Biarritz at 11:40 and arrives in Nice at noon. Here, Kevin. Thanks. - Are you standing? - Yeah, why? You look far away. That's taken care of. Hot board. Hot broad. You're the King of Diss? Please, Miss, call me Brice. You've got the beach buzzing. Yeah, well... story of my life. - So you surf a little? - Fluently. Ultra-Bright smile. Gotta love it. Very nice... - Got a girlfriend? - Better. A mermaid. You like to stare! Got a name? I'm Gladys. The Queen of Kiss. I smell future bliss. I'll pay you back. I want my gear back or I'll call the cops. Burning hot! Not the cops! Don't call the cops! I'll do anything you ask. Here. I'll sweep sand on the beach... - But no cops. - Anything? - That's not what I meant. - Follow me. Are you okay? Not too tired? This book is great. I'll lend it to you. Don't bother. I'm not big on books filled with letters. Never read? I've read lots... What's that one about? People who live in the ocean, whales, dolphins, love. What? Love. There you go. That's why I... And I don't read any more. It's always the same stuff... It's dumb. Oh, so it's dumb? Well, no. Go on. You have a way to go. Pass the ball to me! I'm the best. Get lost! Ass-ball! Balls-ball! Foot-ball! Who wants a poster of me? Axe-ball! How are Brice's Spices? Top-spin! Come here, Natasha... You're smart physically. And I never even liked volleyball! - Not great. - I'm lousy! No, you just have a fat ass. Act like you don't know anything. It's easy. Who are you? Who you? Yoo-hoo! Brice from Nice. I'm Igor. Igor from Hossegor. - Igor from Hossegor? - You lose, I score. Repeat. I hit "Delete". Igor from Hossegor. - Come here. - I'm fine here. You'd be better here. Don't hang around her. Go back to the kiddie pool. Don't compete, unless you like defeat. Capisce? Axle rod? I don't get it. It usually works. Don't screech, it's the beach. - Lots of his type around here? - One. Just one. I see three. As Bodhi says, it's all in the rhythm. Life, surf, rhythm. But at the end of Pointbreak, Bodhi drowns. And dead people don't got no rhythm. Wrong! Wrong! Totally wrong. You didn't get it. I could even call you a liar... Liar! At the end of the movie, Bodhi doesn't die. At least not spiritually! It's the essence of Bodhism. Not to burst your bubble, but I saw the movie. At the end he dies physically. Wrong! So wrong! You're the dead one! You're totally dead. You misunderstood, Kevin. - My name isn't Kevin. - Who cares? But in Pointbreak... What Brice means is... - Correct me if I'm wrong... - Just hurry. Bodhi is reborn in the tube. In other words, when I enter the Tube, I'm heading unconsciously back into my mother's vagina. Yuck. And when I emerge from the Tube, at that very moment, I am reborn. Crystal clear. Not bad, huh? It's not that simple. I practice Bodhism. Our opinions differ, so yours must be wrong. I saw it 6614 times, so I know... I am Marius from Fr?jus. I'm his... ma?agero numero uno. - Babakar. - Cindy. Cindy. What did you do today? Me? Not a damn thing. I hope you won't let me down. Because the prize money, for me... it's incredibly important. Come on! Did you see the one... - Not like that. - Like what? That's not how. Use both feet at once. Who do you think I am? A guy in a championship who can't even take off. Watch me. - Not bad. - Clean off your board. It's all sandy. - Been surfing long? - Not really. - Watch out! - Scared of waves? No. I don't like small waves. Just the big ones. "Surfin' the Waves!" Tomorrow is day one of the 5th-annual World Underground Surf Cup. "Surfin' the Waves" takes you backstage where the Riders are breakin' the ice. - Brice, from Nice. - Arnaud, from Lacanau. In control, on a roll, eat light tonight. Babakar, from Dakar. Bodhi is in me. Bodhi is in my body. Nikos, from Mykonos. Surfing is a mind-trip! Igor from Hossegor. Personally, I'm going to win. As for the others, guess. - Brett, from Tibet. - Loic, from Le Croisic. Greg, from Paris. - You surf? - I play volleyball. - Igor is a Wave Mutant! - Hands off. Let me thank my sponsor. - Enough. - Free Le Croisic! Go catch a clam. Brice is from Nice and he's this year's... challenger! Yeah, I'm the challenger! Don't take it badly, but don't you ever stop showing off? I can't stand it. Can you just go die? He's axed. Cut and print! Air France, flight 153. Departure: Biarritz, 10:15. Arrival: Nice at 11:00. 337 euros. Cool. I spoke to my mom. - Something bit me! - It's just a crab. Fooled you! Are you lost, Barbie? The bird fountain is that way. Very funny. Killer jokes. You're dressed like seaweed. Cause I go with the flow, Brice Pudding. Axed, waxed, wasted, basted... I'm not axed, not even dented. You lose, I score. Igor's a slime ball. You're right. He's a phony. You're not going in? Not this morning. I've fallen from grace with the sea. Could be the moon. Could be a dune. You're at one with Nature! He's such an incredibly sensitive guy. Doesn't he look like Brad Pitt... with wavy hair? Did you see a little dog? About this big. This tall. He was running. He went that way... Or that way. I don't know. I'm so in love. Ever set foot on a boat? I'll sail my foot up your ass! Are you always so rude? Do another round trip. Thanks, teddy bear. Here. Come on... It's much nicer from this side. It's a... Nice, isn't it? I restored it myself. I'm going around the world. What? All alone? Why not? I don't know... You're not scared? Of what? Everything... under water. Killer fish... hurricanes, pee-rats... Pee-rats like you? You're the first man aboard, besides me. Want to see my cabin? Come on. Take off your shoes. What? - Why? - That's the rule. Sorry... I have to get going. Someone called me. I better get going. Are you crazy? Where are you going? I have to go, that's all. But where to? You'll drown! I have to go! Sorry! Get back on my boat! - How's that? - Feet more apart. - Once more. - Just say so. - Very good. - Good? Excellent. Best take-off on the Riviera! I'm waxing out. You didn't think I could surf? - I sure did. - I axed you. You want the Cup? It's yours. Remember Bodhi's last words: "Vaya con dios". - Go with God. - Shut up, you're boring. It's not hard. A lick of cassis, a lick of lemon, a licorice. You shake and shake and shake and shake. That's it? - No, you reshake... - Just two licks? Put your tongue back in your mouth. Axed. Abracada-Brice! - For your friend. - You're the lucky lady! - Okay, I get it. - Spare me. Hold on! What's the problem? What's his problem? He didn't tell you. You can't tell her! Bastard! You can't do this to me... Soon it'll be over. Why? G- I gotta go. What's wrong with these guys? Scoot over. This song is dedicated to the young folk, so lithe and so blithe, relaxed and unwaxed. And to a really great guy, the one and only... Brice from Nice. Hey, Marius. Can you take your shoes off? That's like so funny! Move and I'll bash your face in! Stop it! You can't... Don't do that... No, you mustn't... This is crazy. You mustn't! There you go. Wow! You like them? You're beautiful. You think so? Don't talk too loud. Don't step on my feet. Yo, Bodhi, yeah! Gimme your love, all of you. You in heaven, Kevin? One last spin before I win? Strumming your tibias? Wait! It was an accident! Paws off! - I don't like that. - Does Igor scare you? I'm not scared of Igor. It's cool, I'm 16! 16? I will be next week. Igor, leave him alone! Go clean up my room! You don't get it, gringo. I live here. And she's my sister. Stop polluting my beach and get lost. - We surf soon. - You surf? No, I win. I'll surf against you tomorrow. You're gonna eat my wake and suck my wax. Are you propositioning me? Here I was born and here you will die. - Don't be sore. - This is war. I score. But I'm a Bodhist. - Me too. - Shut up. Whatever color your bodysuit, it'll be red when I finish. I'm going to die laughing. Barrier reef! You know who I am? I even eat raw jellyfish! That's why you're invisible. Axed! No, I call "boomerang". Whatever you say hits you back. You're axed! Then I call "mirror". Everything's reflected back. Loser! He's self-axing! Can I call "yo-yo"? You're like the "e" in "surf". You don't exist. Axed! I win. Zero score! Off the floor! Tomorrow's the Championship. You called "boomerang"? Dumb-dumb. I'm telling Mama Blue. Brice is nice! Loic from Le Croisic, not too quick. Great moves by Brett from Tibet. Tibet or not Tibet. Nikos from Mykonos has taken the lead. Good job! The next group is invited to the sea! But the drink's not on me! It's crazy. I have to tell you. Don't worry. Brice is wearing... Yellow! - Do it for Marius! - Go on, champ! It's cold! What am I doing here? Go on, Brice! Major penalty! In 20 years I've never seen this! Brice from Nice slapped by his own board! Go catch a clam. - Where's Mama? - Calm down. Where's Mama? Where's Mama? I'm a piece of shit! Bodhi? Yeah. Hey, Brice. - Is that you, Bodhi? - I saw you. You didn't go to the max. - There's no excuse but... - Don't try. I'm totally ashamed. But it's not my sea. I like it glassy. You talk the talk, now walk the walk. I've been pretending for 20 years. I'm not a surfer. - I'm a floater. - You got that right. Live your dreams, don't dream your life. That's what will make you a man. Way over my head. You mean someday I'll be a surfer? In another life. - What's waxin'? - Just relaxin'. You look like shit. Whiter than Michael Jackson. Killer joke! I'm axed. Congratulations for the Cup. It's for you. It's the Junior Cup, but it's better than nothing. You're not axing me? I don't feel like it. You're going back to Nice? There's no swell in your sea. But it's swell for me. Swell for me. Brice, it's been really nice. I'm going back to Nice. That's good. I'm sorry for your feet. I've let you down. What about my feet? My feet are fine. What about Brazil? We're still going. We decided to. But once we come back. We're going around the world. Around the world? With... Smooth sailing. Catch a wave! Are you sure... Bumbye. Thanks. - Hey, Mako. - Hey, Brice. - Coffee? - Send it over. How do you manage to wake up so early? Brice, let's go. I'm coming. Forget that. It won't fit in the truck. Gimme a sec! Come on! Shit! Shit! I missed my wave! Did you catch it? Wake up! Did you? Leave me alone. I can die now. Tell me how it was, then die. - Helga? - No, Alice. Alice? Yes. Alice... from Nice. Lame name! Axed! If we have a boy, we'll call him Brice. And if we have a boy? Dennis. Dennis de Nice. Nail clipper. I shouldn't have called "mirror". I should've called... "echo" or "spring". Usually, I'm un-axeable. You're axing me? No respect. Subtitles by Andrew Litvack Processed by C.M.C. - Paris Still here? No home? Axed!
