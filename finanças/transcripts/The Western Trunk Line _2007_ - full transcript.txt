The wild geese flying out of sight... The wild geese flying out of sight... Those who don't reach the Great Wall are not true men... Those who don't reach the Great Wall are not true men... Let's review our homework. Chen Xiaomei, you recite the text through. The sky is high; the clouds are light; the wild geese flying out of sight. Those who fail to reach the Great Wall are not true men. We who have already measured twenty thousand li; high on the crest of Liupan. Red banners wave freely in the west wind; today we hold the long cord in our hands; when shall we bind fast the Grey Dragon? Good job! Wu Xiaohui, please recite it again. "Big square face. Small eyes. Ugly." Want to have it? It's made in Beijing. Yours has only a single transistor. It can't receive shortwave. I have one that can receive shortwave. Look! This is fake! It's not! Take another look! You're just boasting. Let me tell you something. I heard that someone in southern town has made a radio... ...with 8 transistors! With a flexible antenna and a leather case. It can receive shortwave and music! With that baby, you don't want to listen to Radio Moscow! Really? Yes! Don't touch my instrument! Give it back! Thief! I was just playing with it. Yu Xueyan. You come from Beijing? Who are you? How did you know my name? I'm Li Siping. I live in the block in front of your house. Everybody in this town knows who you are. Stop! Dance for me. Like you did on stage the night before. Did you draw this? What's your family name? I live in the block in front of your house. Why don't you go home after school hiding here drawing? My father wouldn't let me draw. No drawing? But I think you're a little artist. An artist should display their works in an exhibition for people to see. Half a pound of dumplings. Here is your change. An exhibition... An exhibition... It fell, eh? An exhibition... Square face, I'm giving you the paper for you to draw on. On a country scale, to carry out "three rules" and "double destruction"... Only beggars eat like that! I told you not to drink that much. See! Now you wet your bed! Troublemaker! Shameful! We are arriving at the Ironworks, Cement Factory. Calcium Carbide Factory and the Elementary school. Please be prepared to get off. Dear father, how are you? I want to tell you a piece of good news. I'm now a member of the Art Ensemble. We have dumplings for every meal. I can make 20 or 30 yuan every month. I'll send you a photo later. The money is for you to buy some medicine. Take care of yourself and don't worry about me. Yu Xueyan, member of the Art Ensemble. Master. This doesn't worth a penny. I wouldn't be taking this if I were not giving you a favor. How much is the copper? Half a yuan per kilo. Copper is surely more valuable. Stop! Stop! How dare you steal copper from our factory! Stop! I remember you! Stop running! Don't you think that I don't know who you are! Daughter of a reactionary. Pretending to be a member of the Art Ensemble just with an instrument on your back? What do you want? What are you doing? Let go! Give it back to me! Let go! Get lost! What the fuck are you doing here? It's none of your business! Where did you get this? From Beijing. Oh, Siping! That guy from southern town is big now. His gadget can receive voice from the other world. That's why he is able to charm the pretty girls. Decadent music, you understand? Hey, why do you get dressed up like this? It's not new year's day today. Why do you keep silent? Are you seeing somebody? Really? Where is she from? Beijing. Don't talk big. Look at you, a clodhopper. A girl from Beijing? No. She is from Beijing, and she can dance too. Get lost! I don't believe you! I'll do whatever you want me to do if that were true! Get lost! Is there something wrong with Siping today? Why did he behave so well? This is mother's. Don't touch it! Otherwise I'll K (dress you down) you. What do you mean by "K"? This is Beijing dialect, you kids don't understand. Shameless Rascal! Isn't it the guy who stole copper from our factory? It's him! Yes, it's him! Get that thief! Get that thief! You can't go away! I was looking for you! I didn't expect that you'll come here. Where is the copper you stole? Sold. You sold it? Then where is the money? Don't touch it! Let go! Dear father, how are you? What is the relationship between you two? When did you become a member of the Art Ensemble? You two collaborated to steal things here, eh? I did it on my own. It has nothing to do with her. Theft! Do you understand the consequences of your offence? You will get yourself prisoned! Tell me what exactly you want! I want her to dance. What? Can't hear you. Speak up! I want her to dance for me. My father and I have been depending on each other. I love him very much. I came here to toughen myself, to be as strong as my father. Where is the radio station that plays music? I have no idea. You're from Beijing, how come you don't know? It's perhaps in another world. Another world? Sometimes I don't even go back home during the night. Just stay here looking out. It's an ocean beneath the surface of the earth. Do you know? You say that I'm penny-pinching? The shoes you're wearing are mine! The sewing machine is taken from my home, right? Are you call me penny-pinching? Who don't know you are penny-pinching around here? What did you do? The new shoes are already creasy! Easy! It's OK now. Here I am. I've brought many pieces of cloth from home. We still need several colors. You're surely capable! Nothing is too difficult for you! No wonder your name is Omnipotence! Weren't you saying all the way that you are going to sell it? Why don't you take it out now? Let me tell you. You are capable of anything except this. You can't sell it. Are you going to sell it or what? Here you are. It's a Seagull, a very good one. Loaned to you for two days. Slow down. You can walk through the main gate. What a wonderful auditorium! Your coat is torn. What happened? I got it scrapped just now. Why do you bring me here? I think of the radio whenever I see the camera. Your father must believe that you are a member of the Art Ensemble when he sees the photograph. I've sewn up your coat. Where are you going? I will just be out for a little while. I've made the dough. We will have bun tonight. Mother would not let you go out. Stay at home. I didn't expect that you'll come back. My dad is dead. So you're happy now? Fired by the factory? What an achievement! You two conspired to cheat me! You, just like this hopeless brother of you! I told you to watch him go to work. Where the hell did you go? Look at you! Just look at your clothes! I have just put it on you and you messed it up like this! What's so funny to look at? Square face! Square face, mum has brought you some oranges. Some day, I am going to take the train to see the world outside. It's here! Don't move! Put your clothes on! Run?! Move! Be smart! Hurry! You shameless thing! You are finished today! We have lost our face because of you! You are finished! Finished! What a dirty thing you have done. You have no shame! Beat him! Beat him hard! Beat this shameless thing once for all! The girl rascal is coming out! Run! Get away! We are now broadcasting the ceasefire announcement of the Department of Defense on the bombardment of the Greater Quemoy Islands. The PRC's Defense Minister Xu Xiangqian announced that the PLA would stop the bombardment of Greater Quemoy Islands since 1958. The full text of the announcement reads as the following: The People's Republic of China and The United States of America has announced the formal establishment of diplomatic relationship, which is of great historic significance... The elder son from Old Li and the girl back there. Come on! Come on! A rascal's brother! How dare you watch a girl pee?! Catch the rascal! Catch the rascal! You're the rascal's brother!

Ask their advice. Put on a coat when it is cold. Remember to change your clothes. DOn't drink cold water. Don't forget to write to us. That's enough. He is an adult. It's time for him to leave home and get some experience. This is the first time our boy leaves home. Follow your leaders. Make us proud. Remember? Mom, Dad, I have to go now. Mom, Dad, I'm leaving. Siping, work hard in the army! Siping, don't forget to write to us. The money is sewn up in your pocket - 20 yuan. Remember, Siping. Siping, remember what mum told you! I will. Don't forget to write to us. We're arriving at the Ironworks, Cement Factory, Calcium Carbide Factory and Elementary School of The Western Trunk Line. Please be prepared to get off. This was your brother's coat. He won't wear it anymore. I've altered it for you. It is too large. No, it will fit you after a while. Stop. Xueyan. You are not very accurate. This second finger should move down a little. Right! Give full play to the bow. Again. Why has brother become a little nearsighted? It must be something wrong with his writing position. Too near to the paper. Mum should keep an eye on him when he is writing. I'm fine on the naval ship. The sea is just great! Have you received the rubber overshoes that I sent by post? Do they fit brother? You should listen to what Dad says. I'm applying for membership to the Communist Youth League of China. A revolutionary salute to you, your son Siping, winter, 1979. Hurry, Doctor Li. Attention! Turn left! Turn right! Three steps forward. Turn back! Salute! Comrade Li Siping was working on the sea when a typhoon attacked. He was swallowed by the waves as he tried to save national property. He gave his life as a sacrifice for his country. Comrade Li Siping is a hero! Unbonnet! Make a bow! One, two - there's a nut in the roadside... You, rascal's brother! You don't sing well. My brother is not a rascal! Your brother is a stinky rascal! Stop the fight! Stop the fight! Yellow hair bullied again! Why are you always bullying others? How about here? OK. Please sit tight, Doctor Li. A little to your right. Smile.
