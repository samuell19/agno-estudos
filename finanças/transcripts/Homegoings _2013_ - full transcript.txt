They're with them. -[Isaiah] In this life, it can get so rough that you want to go someplace to get some rest. When it comes to death and funerals, African American people, we have our own way. It has worked for us throughout the ages. It has kept us balanced, sane, and everybody know that it's gonna be a sad, good time. -I know my brothers and my sisters, we are sad for today. But I'm not gonna let you be sad while I'm standing. Because we're here for a celebration. Not a celebration of death. But a celebration of a new life. -[man] We sometimes fall out and faint. Shout. Get everybody all fired up. We have a way of releasing what is within us. -This is my mom, um, back in 1955, 56, so she was about five or six years old in first grade. She was 59 when she passed away, and she was diagnosed with multi myeloma, which is a cancer to bone marrow. -[man] In our culture, the person that does your eulogy usually can stir the people up to make them get really, really excited so it gets them over that threshold of grief and sadness and to the point of feeling like celebration, or celebrating, because usually there's a good message for the people. -As Kathleen laid in the hospital bed, she was afraid of where she was going. She don't know what it's gonna be like. She know what her surroundings are like now, but she doesn't really know what her future's gonna be like. But she made prior preparation. Where are we going?

Our hours are Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 8:30 PM. Isaiah Owens Funeral Service. Where beauty softens your grief. -I've been in the funeral business now for 42 years. Here at the funeral home, I work with my wife Lily. My daughter, I call her DD, but her name is Shaniqua Princess. And my son Isaiah Christopher. -Um, it's free. When you come in for your remains, just ask for them and they'll give them to you. -It's called liquid tissue. Um, probably a first cousin to botox that you get when you're living. Except you get this after you pass away. And what it's doing, what I'm doing now, is this lady is 98 years old. I'm trying to make her look like this. Um, I need some crazy glue. In the 80s, you had, whew, if it was ten people downstairs who had died, there were probably four homicides, four people, five people with AIDS. Now, most of the people that come are people that die from natural causes. Heart problems. Cancer. Hypertension. Especially in our community. We have a lot of death from strokes. I've been called to do this work by a higher power, so at the end of my life, I might have failed at a lot of things when I stand before God, but I can check off one thing. And that's well done for the bodies. Because every body that he gave me, I gave it back to him splendid and good and I never slighted anybody. So the work that he put here for me to do, I did 100 percent. Other things I probably came real short. -You know I've been a red head my whole life. -[Isaiah] Huh? -You know that. -[Isaiah] What happened? -Nothing. I've just been sick a lot and I ain't want to put the family through it. -[Isaiah] Okay, yeah. -Especially my children. -[Isaiah] Yeah. You got a budget you want to stay within? -Yeah.

It's good your doing this. Because they would be in a tizzy. -[Linda] When I talk about death, I talk about it like living. I don't know if that's the way I was raised in church, but there was a time that I would've been like, oh, I don't want to talk about it, too. The more you go on as life, you see that you have to say, let's prepare for this. It's going to happen eventually. -Now, let's get this hair color down. Just in case you don't get a chance to get your hair done before it's time. What is the color of this red you've got? -[Linda] Red on red. -Red on red? By who? -Can I call you and give you back that information? -[Isaiah] Call me and give me your hair color, because you know how particular you are. Red on red. -We have to have you red. -Yeah. And you saw that-- -[Isaiah] And that's a rinse or a dye? -Dye. Cause he know I want red. -[Isaiah] Yeah. -You know I want a red outfit. And I was showing her this top last night. -And how much embalming fluid can we get done in the boob? -[laughter] -All right! I want 'em up! -[Isaiah] The botox boobs. [laughter] -I want 'em up! I'm talking to you. They say, "Oh, she looks beautiful! Oh, her boobs look nice." [laughter] -You can get it if you want it. -You know I have to get that to say my name, and he gonna put A.K.A. Redd. R-e-d-d. -That's what they call you for real? -Mmhm. -Since about 74, 73, mostly everybody calls me Redd. So if somebody comes to the funeral, they have to have "A.K.A. Redd" because a lot of people don't know me as Linda. Some people just know me as Redd. And even if you don't make it Redd, you can make it clear like this and put the red in it, see? -[Isaiah] Yeah. Like the red tip for the greenness. -Yeah. Something like that. -[Isaiah] Are those called French nails? -No. These is my nails in silk wrap. I didn't know you ask all of that. -[Isaiah] You can't talk after you're gone. -[laughter] -[Linda] I'm not trying to spend a whole lot of money. -[Isaiah] Listen. You're doing this for you. And that's why you're doing it. You've got no one to second guess. You can figure out what you want. Do what you want to do. ♪piano music♪ -I know one day it's gonna happen, and I don't want it to happen but it's gonna happen. So I had to deal with the talking about it. Because there would be times where I'd say to myself, why am I doing this? But it's something that I had to do to alleviate the pain for my family. -[Isaiah] Your total comes to 9734. -[Linda] Homegoing. A happy occasion. They are going home to be at peace. If you're sick, you're at peace, okay? If your time to go, you're going home to meet the ones that went on before you and they're waiting for you. I don't want to leave my family never, but it's a homegoing. And I'll be home waiting for them when they come. -That's it. -I don't have the answer to everything. I just want to be, when I go, just be happy that I spent the time that I spent with you, and try not to cry too much or grieve too long. But remember the time we shared together. ♪piano music♪ -[Isaiah] I'm the owner of Owens Funeral Home in New York City, and Owens Funeral Home in Branchville, South Carolina. My mother works two days a week at the funeral home in Branchville. She's like the receptionist. -Hello? -[Isaiah] When I was a kid, you wouldn't get my mother in a funeral home. If she went, she went because there was a reason she had to go and, you know, she wasn't so comfortable with death. And I guess nobody is comfortable with death. At five years old, I dug a hole, buried a match stick, put the dirt over it, put some flowers over it, so actually that was my first funeral. These are the men. This is a lady. This is the hearse. Family's coming to the church. That's when the bell rings. Ding! When I was growing up, I buried frogs. I buried chickens. I buried the mew that died. I buried the neighbor's dog. And the dog's name was Snowball. One day they found Snowball under the house dead. So they came and got me and I buried Snowball. Except a snake. Snakes just got thrown into the woods or whatever. This is a pregnant lady. This is an old man. They thought I was a mental case. -[woman] I don't know where he got it from. I don't know where he got it from. [chuckles] He was a myth. But that was his calling. ♪piano music♪ -[Isaiah] Earth to earth. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust. I was isolated and lonely but I had a business under the house. I had my funeral home. It was the only little place in my life that I felt comfortable. My father was a sharecropper. Everybody that lived in the house was out picking cotton and you got paid two cents a pound. So if you picked 200 pounds of cotton in a day, you got paid four dollars at the end of the day. When I was growing up, people buried people by planting cotton. You know, they would go to the funeral home, and someone would die, and they would sign a promissory note that when the cotton is ready this year, they're gonna come back and pay. ♪dramatic music♪ The black funeral home director wound up being a friend. Somebody in the community that was stable. Appeared to have means. When I was growing up, we didn't have a telephone. Whenever somebody got sick, they would call Mr. Bird at the funeral home. And then he would ride out into the country to tell my mother that such and such was sick in Philadelphia and that your sister called. -[Isaiah] The funeral business have long had a strong relationship in the black community. Probably because it was a business that white people never really wanted to do. We're their brothers and their sisters. We are family. We don't go outside of the family when trouble comes. -I see some up there. -I see them right here. I've had to bury everybody. I've buried my sister, my father, my nephew, my brother. I've buried one, two, um, three of my mother's sisters probably and four of her brothers. And their wives, most of them, or husbands. I've buried a lot of family members. ♪piano music♪ My grandfather, who was the first black insurance agent in the state of South Carolina, was getting ready to start a funeral business when he was killed, I think, in 1946. Maybe I kind of took over where my grandfather left off. -[singing] ♪I am free♪ ♪Praise the Lord, I am free♪ ♪No longer bound, no more chains holding me♪ ♪My soul is resting♪ ♪Ain't that a blessing♪ ♪Praise the Lord♪ ♪Hallelujah, I'm free♪ -[Isaiah] I think that there was a time when the slaves were killed. Sometimes by their owners by whatever means. It wasn't a proper funeral, but they kind of did their best, even with the restrictions that was put upon them when they got into the woods away from the slave masters and it was having funerals. They came up with these songs like, "Soon I will be done with the troubles of the world. Going home to live with my god. No more weeping and wailing. No more weeping and wailing." ♪dramatic music♪ For the slaves, death meant freedom. It meant that they would meet a judge who would be just and fair to them. Even for us today, death brings us justice. [railroad crossing sounds] I came to New York when I was 17 years old. The day that Robert Kennedy's body was being taken to Washington DC for burial. I was on the bus coming to New York. During that summer I got a job at a plastic factory on a 138th Street and I worked there until September where I started mortuary school. The first body that I did, I was doing my apprenticeship with Elizabeth Smith Funeral Home. Elizabeth Smith was the person who taught me. ♪piano music♪ Someone had died and a family recommended me. Immediately she heard about it, so she put me out and told me that I was going to steal all of her business. There used to be a lot of funeral homes in Harlem, but since 68 I probably could count at least 20 or 25 funeral homes that have gone out of business. Forty years ago you had your allegiance to your mom and pop funeral home. All of that generation that went to the little small funeral homes is finished. I get faxes from different companies that says to me, uh, if you're interested in selling that we would be interested in buying. But at this particular point I don't think that I'm interested in selling because I'm trying to create a business that could take care of my family for the next 100, 200 years. -This is the-- That's right for that... -As a child growing up I was always petrified of, uh, hearses and the dead. When I was growing up, funeral directors... they hand felt cold, they looked... They looked like funeral directors. Always in black. Isaiah, he's, you know, he's the jolly type. ♪soul music♪ You know when I met him, he had the same giggle, the same laugh, yuppin' around when he laughs. So that was like-- he don't look like a funeral director. But of course, when they told me he was a funeral director, I really didn't want to meet him. He's his own individual, a unique person, and I let him be who he is. -I got this one cause they want everything pretty much in white. For her. White bridal dress and all that kind of stuff that they made. If it looks too tacky. I'm gonna be on the horse and buggy anyway. Right now, this is a costume. In the 10.000 funerals plus I have conducted, there is never two funerals the same. ♪African music♪ -My mother's name is Petra Cruise Butler. -She was selling clothing on 125th Street. She was a street vender. -She made these Africa gongas, which was a head wrap. With her dashikis and gongas, that was what supported our family. -[Isaiah] My style is based on the southern tradition of funerals. -Listen, I would like a horse and buggy for my mother. Because we really didn't know about a parade. We just said we want a horse and buggy. But he says,"We're gonna have a parade!" -You had a Christian family. You had a Muslim family. You had an African family. You had a Puerto Rican family. And you had the whole community that loved her. People, once they found out they was her, they were just joining the parade. -It's like walking them down the road and holding the family by this hand and holding the dead person by this hand and getting them to that point where they no longer need me, and they can kind of go on. -My sisters are Yoruba priestesses and a lot of time the Eguns of the ancestors come back in different ways. They come back and they speak through people. -Tell them! I am here! What you prayed for! I can dance! I can dance! I can dance! I can dance! -[woman] It's almost as if you can say my mother's body transferred into her body for a minute. She was saying, "I am here." And then she started dancing. My mother loved to dance. My mother loved to dance. -And she was talking to the crowd and talking to us. Giving us her last goodbyes and last advices. -[woman] I can dance! I can dance! ♪drumming♪ -[woman] When they said she was gonna die, I said, "Mommy, if you need to go, then you should go." A homegoing. Going home to all our ancestors and everybody that left before her. So you really going home. I would tell her job well done and it was an honor being her child. I feel that being an undertaker... you have to first be a caretaker. Not only making their loved ones look special, but you got to make the ones that are left behind feel special. And he does that very well. [cheering] -[Isaiah] My kids grew up in the prep room, anywhere a body was, they were there. So for most people, that children would be afraid. They were actually never afraid. ♪piano music♪ -As a kid growing up, my family was, to me, just like any other family. My dad just had a... different job. -Up, up! Right, right. Uh-uh. I don't want to mess with this part right here. -I like the business aspect of the business. As far as dealing with the families, it's too emotional for me personally. And with remains, I'd rather not. I'm fully capable of it, but I'd rather not. This business is his life. 24/7, 365. Eats, sleeps. Everything is just funerals. -[Isaiah] I remember the first family I did. Back in 1970, 71. I buried Mr. Roofesfield and that was my first funeral. When I look at these pictures it makes me feel like... we're here. And then we're gone. And all that's left is either some pictures or some memories. Last year my business probably dropped about 65 funerals from the year before, and it's because of the economy. No matter how much you love somebody, you've still got to eat. You've still got to pay your rent. So you can't go and get yourself put outdoors to try and get somebody buried. Okay we need to assemble ourselves in couples to go over to the grave. You're going to be first probably right? I get quite a few people that come now, whereas they would normally have a traditional funeral and burial for somebody, and now the best they can do is a direct cremation and maybe hope to get enough money to do a memorial service. ♪singing♪ Normally in good times families will get together and put in 300 dollars a piece, 400 dollars a piece, and they just chip in money and do it. But now, um, you've got to try to keep your job and they're not doing it anymore. ♪piano music♪ You have an obligation.

I woke up at about eight o'clock, and my first message was from my grandfather letting me know that my grandmother passed away at 7 AM. He was at the hospital with her, and the nurses told me that he was there, holding her hand still. It took them awhile to even get the body out because he wouldn't let go. ♪piano music♪ This is one of my grandmother's modeling pictures. She was always very fashionable. She also told me that, you know, when she was coming up, how hard it was for black women to get modeling jobs. Or to get any jobs at all. You know, not only as a woman, but as a black woman. -[Isaiah] You know, Mrs. Simon, she was always dressed up very pretty. And was always here with him. He was in last week to make her arrangements and, uh, he just kind of looked a little tired... And I kind of said to him, you know, maybe it was just the right timing for Mrs. Simon to go because now you can get some rest, and she can get some rest, you know? Not knowing that the next day he was going to be gone too. In grief, in mourning, I've seen people die. ♪piano music♪ -[man] When I went to see him that Friday, you can just see he was glazed with weakness. It seemed like his reason to live was gone. I knew right away that maybe his time was... was going to be short. But I didn't expect it to be as short as it was. I never understood how much he loved her until she actually got into the nursing home. He would literally still go to the hospital every day and hold her hand, kiss her hand, rub her head. And that's when I knew that he was nothing without her. -[man] [singing] ♪Why so much pain♪ ♪I know what's best for me♪ ♪My weary eyes, they cannot see♪ -[man] Honestly I was thinking too that I was dreaming. Because who expects a double funeral like that, you know? I was also having a little bit of regret.

Mama. September 29, 2016. We will see you right back here in this same spot celebrating your 100th birthday. All right? Five more years. God bless you. My mother asked me to do her eulogy when she passes away, and, uh, she has a second person as a backup in case when the time comes I'm not able to do it or I don't want to do it. I think it'll probably be the most difficult day of my life. So it would just be, um... A mess. I guess that's it. It'll just be a mess. It's not depressing to always be in the presence of death. What it does is it kind of keeps your feet on the ground. I don't practice this all the time but anything you need to do, you should do it now, because tomorrow is not promised to you. I'm not afraid of death and I'm not afraid of dying. I went some years ago and had a living will done, so that when my time come, the people that love me won't prolong my agony and keep me here in pain. I think that talking about death is healthy, but I think about it all the time too. I'm always at my funeral. ♪piano music♪ I remember a dream that I had. I was trapped in this building in the Bronx and I went up to the top of the building and I don't know what I was trying to escape from. And there I was standing on this tall building. And I decided I was going to jump off the building. I jumped off the building and just kept flying straight up towards Heaven. I will always remember that dream. Now when they sing at funerals, "Some glad morning when this life is over, I'll fly away," I know how it's done. Because I've flown. Because of my love for the living and the dead. It's why I am who I am and do what I do. In the midst of life, we are in death. They say that at almost everybody's funeral. In the midst of life we are in death. ♪bluesy gospel music♪
