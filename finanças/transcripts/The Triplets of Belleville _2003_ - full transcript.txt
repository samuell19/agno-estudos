A Team Nanban (594mgnav) Release THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE We apologize for this interruption... Is the movie over? Don't you want to tell grandma? Is the movie over? We now continue with a musical interlude. In this 17th stage of the Tour de France the pack, the machine of muscles and steel, finally gets going. But before the rubber tests the overheated paving-stones of Marseille, these young lads still have many obstacles to face. And a fantastic escape by the yellow jersey, who devours Klaut and Glutman of the canned food factory from Frankfurt. They'll have a hard time catching up on the spot where they already failed miserably last year, When they really had to bite the bullet. How admirable this fierce endurance is On the face of this great eagle. The very top lies at an altitude of 1912 metres, the horrible Ventoux, an impressive scenery of white desert, under a burning sun. They climb standing on the pedals, Constantly watching their gear ratio, It is hell. But before they reach the finish, they work themselves into a sweat, and leave behind that musky smell, That supporters know so well. The pack sink into oblivion. For some the bell already sounds And they give up. Those who can not really pound the pedals, lose pace, fall behind, vanish into nothingness. Together with a dazzling speed comes the liberating descent to Marseille. Keep going, my DOV! Insurance company "The Pigeon" gives away a whole week's free insurance for the best sprinter.
