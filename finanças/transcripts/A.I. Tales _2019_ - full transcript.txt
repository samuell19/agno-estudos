(liquid pours) (clink) (eerie, dark music) (Nathan gasping) (eerie music) My name is Nathan. It's my last birthday. (guests cheering) (guests clapping) Please, please don't kick me in the face. (guests groan) No, no, I know you all want to, but please, for me today, please don't. (guests cheering) (guests clapping) (guests laughing) Yes! (laughing) Yes! (solemn music) (guests chattering) Oh, there's lots of cake. (laughs) - Oh, I thought I got it. - You still had some on you. Come on, let's get some food. (wind howling) There's this thing called a fault. That fault is like where earthquakes and volcanoes are mostly... I'll be right back. - You all right? - Yeah. Common. - That's scary. - Scary, I know. [Man] That's scary stuff, does that scare you? Yeah, it scares me. There you are. Here I am. Don't. What? Ask me how I'm doing. (laughs) Thank you, man. I know it's been tough. I haven't exactly been much help. [Jack] Hey man, no one expects you to. Where's Adele? She didn't think she could handle it, you know. Yeah, well, I get it. Marry her. Trust me. That's it, you're a natural. Now get it back there, though. Let me do it. No way. You've got Ethan, you can get away. - I want to do it. - No. - Come on, man! - No! - Let me do... - No. I love you, Jack. (Jack sobbing) (Nathan whispers indiscernibly) Did y'all know about the cake? - I'm sorry. - (both laugh) Fucker. We had to, man. Come on, let's go get a drink. [Jack] All right. (gentle music) (wind howling) (all laughing) But he's just like this, in the room, and I can't, and I'm literally, like, literally looking for him in every room. And did a pants swap. That was the pants swap day. - As you do, as you do. - My pants. My dad's like... [Man] I'm glad I got to see all these photos of you with your shirt off. (all laughing) Hi, guys. Ethan has something that he would like to say for Nathan. So. Okay? - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. [Man In White] Chris, do you mind if I sit there? Thanks, man. It's my father's birthday. (guests cheer) (guests clap) It's usually a happy day, but today it isn't. Today is different. Today he's leaving, and that makes me really sad. But I know he's doing it for all of us. I know that he's strong and that he's brave, and he wants to stay but he can't. And I want him to know how proud I am of him. I want him to know that I will not, that I'm proud of being his son. And I want him to know that I will not throw away anything he's given me. I will not throw away the chance he's given me. The future, I will be the future he wants for me. (solemn music) (guests applauding) Hey. Hey. I didn't think I'd see you before I left. I know. I'm sorry I never called you back. [Nathan] No, I get it. I wasn't sure if I was going to come or not. Yeah, no, I know. (wind howling) I'm so happy to see you. Me too. Do you know what I think about when I think about you? I think about kissing you. In the cabin that summer by the lake. I'm sorry, Cat. I'm so sorry for everything. It was a long time ago. I still don't forgive you. (Nathan growls) (Cat laughs) Well, I guess I have delivered that. - Not for much longer. - Oh fuck! (both laugh) I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Ooh! (laughing) So I got married. [Nathan] That's amazing. Well good for you, Cat. Well is he nice? Yes, you would like him. - Mm, I doubt that. - (laughs dryly) Now you think you'll have kids? I don't know yet. You should. I should've married you. Yeah. [Nathan] I should have done a lotta things. I tried. No, Nathan, you didn't. Yeah. I wasted so much fucking time. And now it's gone. I always thought I was gonna do all these things. And I ended up doing nothing. [Cat] You have Ethan. I can't even look him in the eye anymore. Why? I'm scared, Cat. I'm so fucking scared. I wish I had more time. I just wasted so much fucking time. (sobbing) Shh, shh, shh. I love you, I love you. I love you. But you can't run from this. This is the thing you have to do. It's breaking my heart, but you have to. (solemn music) (guests applauding) (computer humming) Congratulations, it's your 40th birthday. Welcome to the Seed Initiative. We sincerely thank you for complying with the population code.

Simply put this in your mouth and take one breath. What could be simpler? One breath and you save everyone you love. One breath and you give them a future. One breath and you plant your seed. (dark, eerie music) (wind howling) (tense music) (Ethan inhales forcefully) (faint ringing) Hi Jane, thank you so much for your patience. Of course. I'm Dr. Jack Benton. I work with Dr. Stephens and I'll be doing your final paperwork today. Full disclosure, there's a lot. I assumed. First, there'll be the risk analysis profile and this stack here and then this batch here. Everything okay? [Jane] Yeah. I know there's a lot. Let me know if you need anything. Thank you. She left me, okay? We hear this lady screaming at the top of her lungs. I was just trying to get my ass back to work. She like runs off, okay, and then I turn around, out of nowhere, I'm freaking out because this woman just comes up to me and asked me can I watch her baby. Like, first of all, where is your stroller? "Can you watch my baby?" I mean, doesn't even wait for me to respond or anything, she just hands me her actual baby and runs after the guy. Hold on, did you actually see the guy - that took her wallet? - No, absolutely not. I mean, me and Jane we're just coming back from our lunch break, okay, and I was... That's actually true. Yes, it's actually true, yes, that's the one, you weren't even there, okay? I'm just watching this newborn, like out of nowhere. That is so scary. I don't know how anybody raises kids in the city. What am I supposed to do okay? Yeah, what'd you think she wanted you to do? Breastfeed it, change its diaper, tickle it? (girls laughing) My girls. I'm so happy you're both here. Me too. Where's Kurt? He's with the boys, you'll see him tomorrow. Word around town is that Dad has himself a lady friend. [Jane] What? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can't actually confirm anything because he won't tell me anything, but... Huh, is she hot? [Dad] Oh, very classy ladies I've raised. Now does it matter if she's hot? See, see, you admit it, there's a she. (utensil clinking) To Lady Jane. When you moved to this block it changed my life. I got a best friend. [Syd] Yeah, but she's my best friend. Shit. This is my toast! Plus I've known her way longer. (all laughing) Any surgical team is lucky to have you. Even if that means you're off somewhere doctoring without borders and fighting off, you know, the diseases and the mosquitoes... - The diseases? - And the glaciers. This is where I take over this toast and simply say, Janie, oh, she hates this so much. Safe travels, come back soon. Cheers. - Here, here. - Here, here! Doing okay in here? Mostly. Although, I was told that I had the option of an anonymity contract if I so chose? Yes, yes, that is an option. You do know though there'll be no method of contact? Perfect. Jane, you're lying, because you, you could never hold your liquor. She jumped on this guy's back, okay, and he's spinning her around and I'm so, and... (phone vibrating) This had better be an emergency because I told you to only call me in emergencies. What is it? It's work. - I know. - You need to get it together. Put on your big girl fucking panties. (both laugh) Uh-oh. You've been quiet. Yeah. So this job, is there like a visitor situation or... No, it's not like that. Hmm. What? What? What was that, "Hmm?" - Hmm. - Hmm. It's just a noise. People do it all the time, make noises. Everything that you do means something. I think that I've at least figured that out about you. I don't know. What? Say it, Jesus! Stay. Okay. I'm serious, stay. Why? Because. Oh, okay. No. - No! - No what? I don't know, don't tell me... - What? - Don't tell me this is like, is this like a confession of, like, your love? - I don't know. - My love? Jesus Christ. I told you I loved you once in the third grade. - Fair. - And you can't let it go. You just keep thinking about it. [Jane] No, I'm letting it. You know, I thought I was Spider-Man in the third grade. [Jane] You did. I thought I was actually Spider-Man. - It was so weird. (Laughs) - It was fun. I didn't stop a lotta bad guys. I ate actual worms until the fourth grade. I did a lotta things in elementary school that... - You're not proud of? - I don't do now. What? I'm proud of all of it. And I'm with Sarah now also, so. Right. Yeah. You were just making this face. - What face? - I don't know. Like this love face or something. - A love face? - Yeah. Okay, what the fuck is that? I don't know, I don't know, it's just, ugh, erase. I just can't imagine you not being a drive away or even a phone call away. I, like, count on you. I, like, know. It's fine, you'll be fine. [Syd] I don't care, okay? Only call me if you die, okay? Bye, goodbye. Should I... Yeah, you're good. Stay yeah, you're good. (upbeat rock music) (door clicks) Hi. Hey. You need something? Ditching your own party? Something like that. - I can go, if you want. - No, you're fine. Do you like living with Dad? Yeah, it's fine. - You know you don't have to. - I know. No, I'm just, I'm saying that, that you can do whatever you want, you know? Whatever makes you happy. I just want you, I want you to be able to be yourself. Whatever that is. How's that working out for you? You are such a dick. Seriously, how is your life? - What do you mean? - I don't know. I feel like I love you and I don't know you. And I'm just trying to understand you and like... (groans) Relax. Things are fine. I mean, school sucks. Community college is lame, shocker. Mostly I just go to work and hang out with my friends. I don't know, I don't really have a lot to say. Okay, cool. I'm not you. [Jane] Oh yeah? Yeah, I'm good here. I don't need to go do some crazy shit. Do you mind if I sit here for a while? Knock yourself out. (upbeat rock music) (device beeps) That's better. Just... Oh sorry. It's been more than two hours of dotting and signing. An apology's a bit unnecessary at this point. It's an honor to meet you in person actually. I read your application letter. "In the yellow and blue of our days." That was from my mom's favorite song. Honestly, your work on biomedical nanotechnology, it's such a huge achievement. And the innovative way you used that in each round of the selection process. Having your level of expertise on board, it's really, it's all the team can talk about. You fit right in, Jane. I don't know how to say thank you. You just say it. Thank you. Bourbon? Hmm. Your friends leave? I think so. (toy squeaks) (Jane laughs) - How's the old arm? - Mm-hm. (both laugh) What do you think Mom is doing, like, right now? Probably riding a gold plated bike in circles through purgatory. Pissing everyone off. (laughs) Yes, yes. The madwoman cackling maniacally, singing at the top of her lungs. ♫ I was a victim of a series of accidents ♫ ♫ As are we all ♫ (toy squeaks) I miss her. I should say that more. She'd understand. [Jane] Understand what? Whatever's going on with you. Dad, I'm fine. [Dad] Jane. I just wanna know you're okay. No one's really okay. Janie. This is the best fine that I'm gonna be, okay? Deal with it. Okay. You're my kid, let me worry about you for Christ's sake. No. Worry about Bobby. I think his shirts are too tight. I'm serious, I think they're cutting off the circulation to his brain. (both laugh) Yeah, I'll hijack his laundry. It's not like he's gonna do it. Just burn them. You did everything you could for us. Always. I don't know about that. You did. Okay? Just know that. (Jane sniffling) (glass clinks) [Alice] This what I think it is? We have the contract here. And I'm gonna go over each section so that you know what you're opting for. So what? You're just gonna call us up one day and say you're leaving for some obscure job for God knows how long? Do us the, I don't know, courtesy of coming home for a day just to leave a fucking note and vanish at the crack of dawn? Alice, please don't do this. - Me, me don't do this. - Yes. Jane, this is you, this is all you. It's what you do. You walk in and out of our lives like we're not supposed to love you or care if you're here or care if you're not. But we do. Get it through your fucking head. I can't do this, (sobbing) I can't... - Can't what? - I can't, I can't breathe. I wish that I knew how to help you. [Jane] You can't. [Alice] Why? I think I'm not a (mumbles). (Jane sobbing) [Alice] Am I gonna see you again? [Jane] I don't think so. (Jane sniffling) (door bangs) Here we have section one, that's full anonymity. That means that apart from us and your government no one will have access to your involvement in the project. Option two, anonymity until departure. That means any press coverage, any media that's released within the next year until you depart, your identity will be withheld. And then option three, that's anonymity until arrival or complication. I'm guessing that's what you're gonna choose. I'm sorry, you're guessing? Yes, I am, and I shouldn't speculate. It's just that you're the first person I've ever had use this particular contract. What I was gonna say is that I'm guessing this is the option someone would use if they did want to relay status to family and next of kin when you've reached some sort of finality. I'll let you make your decision and step out. Oh, I'm fine. Fantastic. We are done. Finally. I would like to officially welcome you aboard. Congratulations, Jane. You are the newest member of the Mars One Astronaut Program. How does it feel to be an actual pioneer? It's... (gentle electronic music) It's... (device beeping) (man panting) Come on, come on, come on, come on. (device beeps) (siren wailing) (crowds shouting faintly) What the hell, man? We tried to get the jet. (man grunting) (people screaming) Do you see what's going on down here? And they don't even know what's really coming. You gotta take me with you. Just go to a shelter like everybody else. Come on Doug, don't play me. What are you talking about? I know where you're going. (dramatic music) Sarah told me about your little secret. Then you know I can't help you. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Sarah! We can't leave him behind. You can't do this to me, Doug. Would you just for once? I'm your brother! Goodbye. What are you doing? [Robot] Be ready to go to your destination in five minutes. If you wanna survive, you're gonna have to make some hard... (explosion booming) (aircraft rumbling) (alarm blaring) (aircraft booming) (wind howling) [Claire] The signs were everywhere. Hunger, pollution, epidemics. After a century of reckless consumption, civilization was about to collapse under its own weight. Still, I had faith humanity would finally work together hand-in-hand to overcome the greed and selfishness that was tearing us apart. But in the end, those in power chose a different path. The same they always had, war. And when it was over, all we had left was each other. For over a year now we've been heading to a survivor colony out west. But it's still a long way to go. (thunder cracking) (device beeps) (door bangs) (device beeps) Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. How's she doing? Not good. You're gonna have to slow down. Not a chance. We can barely make it to the next town. That's if we keep our pace. What is it, Henry? Thank you. All right. (thunder rumbling) (people cheering) [Announcer] And now, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Wall Street's rising star. Hey Warren! Get your head outta your ass, man, it's dinner time. What's with the mystery meal? Well, I know this journey's been longer than a son a bitch, but today is actually an auspicious occasion. 1,000 miles, the halfway point. Voila. (all chuckle) - Where did you get a cake? - Wow. Actually, Gus here did. He thought it'd be a good way to cheer y'all up. Gus? Is that a heartbeat I'm hearing? (laughs) Now before we dig in, I thought it'd be good to have a couple of words. Claire, why don't you say something? Oh, come on. - Come on now. - Come on. Hmm. (laughs) Sorry, I can't believe everything that has happened sometimes. Huh. A thousand miles. We are far better off than we were a thousand miles ago. All of us. (solemn music) All we have to do is just keep putting one foot in front of the other, that's it. And with the little help of our North Star here, I have hope that we'll find our way to the colony. We're gonna find our way. To hope. To hope. To hope. Amen, amen. (Warren laughing) You okay over there? Hope? Hope? You really think holding hands, singing "Kumbaya" is gonna make a difference? Did anybody actually look at what's out there? Hey, we're in here celebrating, man. Just have a some cake. What are we celebrating? What, that we're stranded in the middle of fucking nowhere with all our food buried under 50 feet of sand? I mean, tell me, Henry, what's on the menu once the cake is gone? Warren, I know you've been through it and I know getting to the colony seems like an impossibility, but it is completely viable that we will make it there. Oh right, the colony. Well, we'll just sit back, have a few cocktails and enjoy the sunset because in a thousand miles things are gonna get so much better. All right everybody, huh? Let's put it together for Warren, man of the year. Okay. You think this is a joke, don't you? I think you're an inspiration to all of us. [Warren] You think this is a goddamn joke? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Okay! (laughs) You all wanna know what the real joke is? Huh? This is the joke. We've been following this piece of shit for way too long. - Put it down. - Oh yeah? And who made you the law here anyway, huh? What, just because you used to run a fucking goddamn prison in some pathetic little shit hole, big deal! You're nothing but a pathetic little piece of... (fist thwacking) Okay, all right, all right. Whoa, Warren. Okay, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop! (Warren yells) Stop it, stop it, just breathe, fucking breathe. You're okay, just breathe, okay, just breathe. There you go, man. You're all right, you're all right. It's okay, there you go. (Warren exhaling forcefully) It's okay. I got you now. I can't. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. - I can't. - Just inhale. I can't do it anymore. One step at a time. One step at a time. Come on. Come on, let's get you up. - Hey there, buddy, come on. - Get up, you're okay. All right, you're all right. You okay? You all right? You all right? Come on. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. (wind howling) (roof banging) (people coughing) (thunder cracking) We need to block the door. - What's going on? - With what? (foreboding music) [Claire] Help me, heave! (all grunting) It's not moving! Fuck, it's gotta be bolted down. Jesus Christ, man, let's just take these things off. (shelf rumbling) (system beeping) (whistles) Well, hello there. How did a pretty girl like you end up in a place like this? [AI Voice] Please enter your authorization code. I see. Playing hard to get. So what now? Time to use my irresistible charm. - Whoa! - (thunder cracks) So we're just gonna break in? We don't even know what's in there. We know what's out there. Let's just get that pass key overall, see, isn't that better? Yes, and, ah, shit! [AI Voice] Authorization code denied. - What are you doing? - Oh, you know, just decrypting a multi-binary quantum algorithm with the stochastic matrix protocol. That means. (laughs) Bam! Okay, okay, all right, come on. - Time to drop the panties. - Authorization code accepted. Come on everybody, let's go, move it. [Warren] Where's my bag? Warren, it's up here buddy, come on. (door bangs) (wind howls) Warren! [Gus] No! Warren! (all shouting) (all panting) [Claire] Hold on, is everyone all right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. Gus, right here. Warren. You okay? You sure? - Hello? - Shh. (people muttering) (system buzzing) (suspenseful music) (system chiming) Welcome to the Phoenix Personal Rescue System, your first choice in post nuclear survival.

(tense music) (keyboard clacking) (computer beeps) Rewind fate. (suspenseful music) (door bangs) [Man] Open it!

(intense music) (somber music) (footsteps clacking) (scientist gasps) (scientist laughs dryly) (soft, eerie music) (aircraft humming) (suspenseful music) (computers beeping) I don't know how you worked before, but you gonna have to trust me at some point. [Jayden] And I don't know how many times I have to tell you, Mac, I'm better off working alone so get used to it, or don't. Just try to keep up. Don't you think the lone-wolf thing is a little cliche? All I need from you is info about the bounty. The rest you can keep for yourself. I'm surprised you even know what cliche means. With the information comes my suggestions. Take it or leave it. [Jayden] Are you giving me a choice? 'Cause if that's the case, then I'm... [Mac] You're what? (gentle piano music) Hello, McFly, you still there? - Do you believe in ghosts? - Ghosts? Oh, wait, are you, are you stoned right now? Forget it. I just hate this place. (suspenseful music) (siren wailing) Jayden, I got some news about our fella. He's been spotted next to a lift-up building on River and Mason Street, check your GPS. I don't need a GPS. I'll figure it out. You're right, I'm sure you'll do just fine. And apparently that's not the only thing you forgot. I didn't forget anything. I just don't need anymore blood on my hands. (suspenseful music) Where the fuck am I? (computer beeping) Mac? Mac, are you there? What? Damn it, Mac. What, were you taking a shit? Sort of. Enjoying the fresh air? Huh, not very fresh. You'd know that if you ever left the fucking cockpit. Oh, did you forget to tell me that there'd be fog out here? What the fuck are you talking about? It's the biggest tower in your sector so all you have to do is look up. Look up. Did you hear me? Fog, you do know what fog is, right? And that's why there's a GPS. If I was you, I'd have been a little bit more prepared. Prepared against the fog? [Mac] I'm just saying, I told your ass to take the GPS. Are you gonna help me or not? - Hold on. - (computer beeping) Mac, I got something you might find interesting. [Mac] What is it? Dr. Jay Connors, physician in cosmetic surgery, was found dead in his office this morning. He developed a new prototype device that can give a person the ability of face shifting. Face shifting? Yeah, it's exactly how it sounds. You can literally change faces. Maybe your wife could use it. Ha-ha, very funny, asshole. Izak Primer was Connors' last patient which makes him our prime suspect. It's possible he could look like this now. Here's a picture of the doc. But that's not all. There's more? The prototype device is missing, so at this point, he could look like anyone. Okay, thanks for the information. - Gotta call you back. - All right. Jayden, did you catch that? If the UP put it all over the news, then all bounty hunters must be after him. And this place is crawling with 'em. What a waste of time. At least we got the advantage. We know he can shit faces. I mean, shit the faces. - I mean, shift faces, damn it! - Shit face? Are you currently shit-faced? I said face shit, I meant face shift. Man, you really have a drinking problem. Yeah, yeah, shut up. Let's focus on putting our hands on Primer. I got a visual on the main streets so you cover the little ones. All right. (suspenseful music) (computer beeping) (gentle piano music) (suspenseful music) Hey, we got company. What's your location? All right, I'll meet you there. (phone ringing) What? [Mac] What the fuck took you so long to respond? Relax, Mac. [Mac] Hey, I see you standing there. Move it! Don't tell me you're already getting tired of doing nothing. I beg your pardon? I do as much work as you. And I have handled everything since you arrived. Everything? You call passing phone calls working? (scoffs) I call it being a glorified receptionist. You are more organized than I am, I'll give you that. Hey, there's another receptionist quality. Enough! We need to be more productive. Let's get back to work. (dramatic music) (man thuds) [Jayden] What do we have here? - Help me! - Don't touch him. Got you. [Man On Ground] You're making a mistake, I'm a doctor. Shut up! [Jayden] Who knows if you would've caught him if I didn't step in. Mind your own business. This doesn't concern you. I said back off, he's mine. Why don't we ask him who he'd rather go with? You think you're funny? You just bumped into us. You have no idea who he is. Izak Primer, 10 million flues. Does that sound about right? I don't care. I've been on this guy for months. Those flues are mine. Listen, man, you don't wanna do this. Why don't we just split the commission and go get some tacos or something? Tacos? Sure, count on it. Look, pal, I don't have all day. This is your last chance. Or what? (panting) You wanna play tough? Actually, I was trying to be nice, but sure. Let's see what you got. (gripping music) (punches thudding) [Man In Black] Where do you think you're going? (Jayden thuds) - He's getting away. - Thank you very much, Captain Obvious. You take this one, I'll go around. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick here. Where do you think you're going? Let's dispose of these idiots and get the doctor before we lose him. You make it sound so easy. (intense music) (punches thwacking) (man grunts) Wait! Wait! Wait! (gripping music) (gunshot firing) I know you're in there, show yourself! (punch thwacking) Is that all you got? (Jayden grunts) (head thunks) (object clanks) I thought you were dead. So where'd he go? Let's try it again. Now where the fuck did he go? I think he went that way. You think he went that way? Did I stutter? I swear to God, if you're lying... He's getting away. You look like you're losing it, kid. You can stay here if you want, but when I come back, you ain't getting nothing. Go get him before I change my mind. - Mac. - What? Trace my handcuff. Izak's hiding in... (gunshot firing) [Mac] Jayden, what was that? Gunfire somewhere in the building. - Did you find my handcuff yet? - [Mac] I'm working on it, but in the meantime, chase the gunfire. There's another bounty hunter after him. [Mac] Beat him to the punch. Just trace my fucking handcuff. [Mac] You're not gonna like this. It looks like the handcuff's untraceable.
