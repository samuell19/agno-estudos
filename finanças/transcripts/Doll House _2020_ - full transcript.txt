Oh, Emma. I'm glad I caught you. Now I know you were looking for something for that awards ceremony next month and I thought I found just the thing. No? Just hold on a second. Oh, now this, I've just put this on display. What do you think? Now the thing is, you don't have to tell me if you want it just yet, but a couple of people have been looking at it today already and it won't be here tomorrow, if you know what I mean. I'll tell you what, why don't you try it on? And if you like it, I'll do it for you at cost. Don't you like it? Thanks, Emma, you won't regret it. Bye! Oh, I nearly forgot the real reason I wanted to speak to you is about the psychic that's in town. She's renowned, Layla the Mystic's what they call her. Sounds so cheesy when you say it. But anyway, she's supposed to be the best for years. She's doing two shows, one tonight that I'm going to, and then she's doing one today at noon. Well, I think you should go. Well, you know, after everything that happened and all. Well, it's up to you, but I think it might do you some good, you know, to exorcize your demons. Ladies and gentlemen, Layla thanks you all for coming today to this very special session of cold readings. Before we begin, I'd like to explain to you a little bit about how this process works. Layla and her spirit guide Jennifer will shortly be ready to get the session started. Now this process is very delicate and that can I ask that there is no photography and that everyone can be as quiet as possible whilst Layla is contacting Jennifer? Thank you. You seen her before? Please, ladies and gentlemen, can I ask you to be as quiet as possible whilst Layla is contacting Jennifer? Thank you. She is with me. She has a person with her. A man. What is it, Jennifer, what does he want? Is it someone here? This man is known to someone in this room here, right now. He's asking for her. He wants to speak to her. He's shouting at me now. Tell him to calm down. Jennifer, ask him who he seeks. He says he was taken from this earth too soon. He's a middle-aged man. It was an accident. So much sorrow. Does anyone here know this man? His name is Robert. Yes? It's you? Stand up. Was there a Robert in your life? Yes. And he was taken from you too soon, wasn't he? Robert was my husband. He was killed in an accident. This is what Robert is telling you. He's standing right beside you. No, don't worry, he's happy. I miss him so much. He wants you to be happy again. He can't be with you for much longer and you must move on. He says he is safe and he will always be here when you need him. I never got to say goodbye to them. They are saying to me that both of them together and they're watching over you. Thank you. My uncle died so young. I know. But he says he is at peace. She was only 14. I know, that is so young. But she's here and she's saying she loves you. She will always love you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I think that concludes our session for this afternoon. Again, thank you all for coming and we'll be back again later tonight for a longer session if you would like to attend or if we missed you out. Thank you very much. Layla? Layla? Call Jennifer! Layla. Jennifer is gone. Go! Get out! Get out of here! Go, get out! Go! Excuse me. What are you doing? What are you doing? Hello? Who are you? I need to speak with your mother. Mother? You still don't get it. Get what? Emma's not my mother. I'll let Emma tell you that for herself. Now I am really interested in your story. My name is Heather. I'm an online vlogger reporter for a paranormal website. I go up and down the country, looking into anything paranormal, strange, or bizarre. Fake psychics, ghosts, ghouls, you name it. Most are debunked. But today? I am unsure. I am unsure whether what I witnessed was not just some elaborate internet hoax. I half expected you to have a video uploaded by now but there isn't one. So my conclusions are either you are the best actor I've ever seen or it's real. I... Now I understand. But what about this place? You're a carer. I have so many questions. My name is Emma. I lost my voice during a traumatic event. The doctors have told me the shock of the event made me mute. They tell me my vocal cords are damaged. It's not a mental block, I'm not crazy, nor do I have learning difficulties. I am me. I have a degree in sociology and I used to talk freely. I'm able to function normally and I love my job. The doctors also say my voice could come back at any point, so watch out if it does, as I'll never stop talking and then you'll have to keep telling me to shut up. So. How many children live here? Two. And Stephanie is one of them? I need to ask you about today, at the psychic event. What happened? I just need to put my mind at rest. Okay. Noah is being a little shit. Can you tell him he cannot chat about me online? He's talked to his mates in the gamer channel. The internet's off. I was at an important checkpoint as well. Guess you and your online zeros won't get it up now. What? I know you've been telling them and it's pissing off. Don't know what you're talking about. See if you can work it out. Even you might be able to. I get it! Good, I'll help her settle in. Oh, great. She gets the best room as well. I wanted that room. Hi, I'm Stephanie. You must be Ava. Shall I take your doll from you? It's fine, I've got it. I'm gonna show you 'round. So this is the bathroom and this is Emma's office, but we do not go in there. And this is the laundry room, the living room, and the kitchen. So we'll go upstairs. This is my room. Spare rooms. This is Conner's room. You'll meet him later. Another bedroom. Bathroom. And this is your room. It's not open. When did this arrive? It's lovely. Wow. Your luggage. That got brought in earlier. Are you okay? Fuck! Shit, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right. How's it going? Wood's rotted again. Again? Yeah, I don't know what could be causing it. Termites maybe. But they were retreated this last week. I know. Can't explain it. Well, keep Emma posted, I guess. Good one. That wasn't meant to be a joke. Oh. How's the new girl? Quiet. It's creepy. She's like Emma. Doesn't speak? Yeah. Maybe the counselor on Saturday could. Emma not being able to speak, so a kindred spirit. Maybe. Listen, if she does anything weird like her head starts spinning around or something, let me know. I love horror movies. Will do. Hello, Ava. I'm James and I'm a psychologist. Now, that's a long word, isn't it? It means I'm a sort of doctor and I'm here to see how you are and to help you if I can. Now, would you like me to help you? Okay. Now Emma and Stephanie tell me that you struggle with words, is that right? Has it always been that way? So you spoke before? When did you stop speaking? You don't want to tell me? Nothing at all? It's all right, it's all right, don't hurry. It's just I really, really want to help you. Would you like to play a game? It's a guessing game. Do you like guessing games? Oh? This is called a Rorschach test. Now that's a funny word, isn't it? Another name for it is an inkblot test. Do you know what that is? I am gonna show you a picture and I want you to write down how you feel about that picture. Just the first thing that comes into your head. Do you think you can do that for me? Are you ready? Card number one. Oh, flowers. That's very good. Second card? Okay. Nothing else? No? Ava, you do understand what I'm saying? Okay. Next card. Ava, um, let's try it again. What's so funny? Can you make enough noise doing that? I'm just eating. You sound like a pig. I knew you'd start complaining. Noah, don't say that, that's rude. Rude? Don't make me laugh. So why aren't you talking then? What's wrong with you? Oh, a shrug. At least she can manage basic body movements. Why do you have to be such a prick? I'm not a prick. Could've fooled me. - Yeah? - Yeah? If I'm a prick, you're a bitch. You're a twat. Besides, you're making Ava feel uncomfortable. Oh, really, uncomfortable? Wouldn't wanna offend her now, would I? Christ, you're unbelievable, aren't you? You best believe it, being stuck in the halfway house to hell in this shitty nightmare. Stop swearing. I'll say whatever I want. Such an asshole. Yeah, yeah, satisfiable to me. Big word, I know. Well, maybe you're faking it. Eh? Noah! Shut up, Stephanie. What do you think, new girl? You're a fake, right? Whatever. Whispering? I see. Could you hear what the voice was saying? What the words were? Right. That is strange. I've heard stranger. Do you think you could have imagined it? It was dark, late? Of course, I'm not saying that you're crazy. Right. Okay. So you may not have been able to tell what the voice was saying, but do you remember how it made you feel? Or rather, how the voice sounded? Was it sad, angry? Aren't you a bit old to play with dolls? Don't ignore me. I said ain't you a bit fuckin' old to play with dolls? You're dumb, not deaf. Or maybe you're bicurious and like looking up the doll's skirt. Is that it? Is that it? Dolls are for babies. Are you there? Do you like what you see? Ring the number at the bottom of the screen. I'm Mindy. The hot MILF. If you wanna see more, join me in me private room. You've got 30 seconds. Shitty wifi! Where's that shit? What the? This isn't funny anymore. Okay, Ava, today's gonna be a bit like last time but I just want you to play with the toys, all right? You play and I'll just watch, okay? I really don't know where to start. It's the strangest thing. I feel like I know Ava, like I know her from the past. And when I'm sitting with her, I get these flashes of imagery. I don't remember them and they're terrifying. You know, I'm a professional. I shouldn't say this but I feel like Ava is getting inside my mind. She's reading my thoughts, my memories, my fears. You look like you've got something on your mind. What is it? Right, but... But it's not the first time he's gone off missing, is it? Yeah, but Noah's 18 now, he's an adult. When's the last time you saw him? Okay, look. I'll put in a call to social services. While I'm at it, I'll go down to the police station and I will file a report, okay? Don't worry, he'll turn up. Yeah, hello, hello, yeah. Can you put me through to the Department 33, please? Yeah, it's James Whitmore, I'd like to speak to Annie. Thank you. Yeah, it's James Whitmore, yeah. No, no, of course I'll hold. So hi, yes, I would like to raise a possible safeguarding concern over a subject. Yeah. I have a name. Yeah. It was like I was there again, when I cut my wrists. Tell that to Noah. Weird. Oh, that's not creepy. Is that meant to be me? That's mental. Yeah, what? You can watch me do this then. Thank you, Byron. So you decided. Decided? To come see me. Well, I really didn't have a choice. I see. What is it? What do you know about the spirit world? I'm a psychologist... That wasn't my question. What do you know of the spirit world? Well, beyond heaven and hell, spirits, ghosts? There are those like me who act as conduits to the other side. Oh, conduits. Oh, don't pretend to know what I'm talking about. But it isn't as simple as just asking a ghost to come contact you, it's more random than that. Oh, I see. As there are conduits, there are also objects. Objects? Cursed items. Items with special properties. Oh, I see. I'm gonna make it perfectly clear to you and I'm gonna say it in no uncertain terms. Look, I came to see you. Everyone in that house is in danger, in mortal danger. Well, I can sense something too. My guide sensed it with Emma. Something truly evil is following her. She can see inside your head, the girl. No, the girl isn't the source. It's the doll, isn't it? You have got to get the girl away from that doll, get the whole family away. Unimaginable evil awaits them if you don't. No! Excuse me, excuse me. What are you doing here? What are you doing? What are you drinking? Why are you here? You told me you'd never drink again! What the fuck is going on with you? You killed our daughter! You fucking bitch! Emma. Emma, are you up? Emma, I've been doing some research. What do you know about Ava? What file? Emma, the girl in the house, this isn't Ava. Before he disappeared, James filed a report at social services and they sent me this photograph. I don't know who that girl is, but it isn't Ava. Emma, you need to get out of here. You need to get out of this house. The house. Emma, it's the house. We need to get rid of it! I need to dispose of it. I have a plan. I'm gonna burn your world to the ground. I'm completely fucking sick of this! How much for the dollhouse? This? This is free. Please, take it away.
