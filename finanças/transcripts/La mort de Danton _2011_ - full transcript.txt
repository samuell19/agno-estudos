THE DEATH OF DANTON She sells seashells on the seashore... Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers... How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? - Two and a half hours ago. - Your watch is broken. It's your watch. Just 5 minutes ago… Listen, we're not doing all that in 5 minutes. I am fast but I'm not supersonic. Clémence! How's it going? - Fine. And you? - Fine. So? Why'd you kill him? Kill who, sir? Who? Were you born yesterday? From the north, huh? What are you doing so far from home? I was waiting for my train. There's no train at this hour. There's one on Tuesday for Memphis. According to you! There is one on Tuesday. Listen up! I'm trying to make this town a safe place. So people can go out at night without fear. - Follow me? - Yes. Then tell me why you killed Mr. Colbert? It'll be a relief to get it off your chest. I was on my way to see my mother. I got here at 3:25. I came in from Brucefield. I was waiting for my connecting train, at 4:20. In the meantime, you bumped off a white guy. And made a few hundred bucks doing it. I broke my back earning that money. Colored folks don't earn money! Cut the crap! Where'd you get it? In Philadelphia. - Mississippi? - Pennsylvania. And what do you do in Philly? I'm a police officer. No, I'm 38. - You don't look it. - How old are you? I'm 27. Know what I'd like? To make you laugh. - Why do you say that? - You seem sad. Who? Me? You're wrong! I'm not saying you're always sad. In fact, you seem tough. That's my nature. I've had a tough life. Life hasn't been easy. Sure, I'm tough. I don't pretend otherwise. You don't match your image. Seriously, I'm not tough. Stop. I'm a nice guy. I can see that. I never doubted it. I don't know you but… I just meant you look tough. With guys, it's like a kind of armor. To be more… to avoid being vulnerable. We all have a way of protecting ourselves. I hope we can do some scenes together. Then you'll see. I wanna be the next star! In 2 or 3 years… You know, 4 or 5 years. No, really! Hollywood, that's the place for me! Hollywood, Cannes, Venice, Berlin, Marrakech… Wherever there's a festival, I'm there! That's where I belong. How is it with the other students? With them… Sometimes I feel out of place at the Cours Simon. Because they don't think like me. My mind works different. See what I mean? So sometimes… there's like a clash. A little clash! You know, we're not alike. We're not alike. We don't live in the same world. Different head, different world. So, in that sense, I feel out of place in class, with those young people. Have you made any friends? Yeah, they all know me. I know them. Those young people must know me. I seem to scare them. A so-called friend of mine says, "I'm your buddy, right? "They're scared of you. "So they wanna get close to you." But I don't get close to them. I don't need that. I feel at ease on stage! Those people don't put me at ease. On the street? No way! I'm not into that. My pal always says, "They cozy up to you 'cause you scare them. "That's how it works." - How does that make you feel? - It disgusts me. Someone said it again yesterday! At work, too! 'Cause I'm not like that! The day I really scare them, they'll see! - Why does that piss you off? - 'Cause it's not me! And now everything's all fucked up! I'm fucked! Now I'm even shy. I can't even talk to chicks anymore! 'Cause that shit fucks me all up! I'm not like that! They fucked me up! Those motherfuckers did this to me! And it disgusts me! I hate that shit! I still can't fucking talk! "You scare people. You're daunting! You're scary." They said that at work. I wanna say, "Go fuck yourself! Get lost! "Quit busting my balls, asshole!" You feel you give the impression of… Yeah! It's not even that. "I'm scary." People who know me know I'm not like that. Some people really know me. They know I'm not like that. They know very well. They know that very well. I'm no motherfucker! I'm scary! I never hurt them. They see a big guy and get scared! Bitch! You got a guilt complex? Why do I scare you? We don't have dressing rooms yet. Put your stuff in here. Okay. Put that over there. We only need it once. In a corner. It won't budge. Cyril! They said the other side. Is that on stage or here? No, the chairs and small stuff go here. Try to be careful… No, be very careful of other people's sets. If you perform in Avignon one day, with lots of plays daily, you won't want people damaging your set. The same here. So be very careful of the other sets. There are two other plays. Be discrete about talking in the theater. Keep your voices down. And… that's all for the moment. For the first spotlight, what do you suggest? Yeah, go ahead! The light should be very bright. We're in Africa. Something… Yes! We're gonna fry. Then there's a music cue. Louder! Lower it! Lower it. Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen! I'm honored to tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was a nigger. Hey, hey, hey! Nobody says "nigger" anymore! It's impolite. Now we say "black." Yes, a black man! Once upon a time, there was a black man… Very good! …in a university restaurant. Good beginning! He took an extra sugar packet. - Why? - He needed it. The black man was asked to return it. He had no right to it. On the culture side, I'll do a bit of theater to illustrate that. How was that request made? With less than exaggerated politeness. Hey, dirty nigger! Dirty nigger from the virgin forests, put that sugar back! That packet of sugar from a great nation! Sure! Look! And he goes like this. He retreats, he advances, he retreats… and pow! See? Bamako's got heroes! Why'd you take off like that? You okay, Steve? Congratulations! You were great! Great! I blew 'em away. I was a smash tonight! Come back next year! Steve! How are you? - Very well! - Great! I finally get to see you up close. You okay? Yeah, cool. Thanks. I saw you on stage. I really loved it. To keep it simple, there are no words. I'll keep it simple. But I really loved it! I hoped you didn't have an agent. Anything's possible. Sure, sure… And I'm very lucky that you called me back. I was lucky you gave me your card. I was lucky enough to see you on stage. We're just starting off… I put a lot of faith in luck. It's important. And now we finally meet. We meet. Who knows? Maybe it's a meeting of two unknowns. And one day we'll be a star and an unknown. You know, in this case, only you can be the star. What films inspire you? Is there an actor who… For me, in France, there's Gabin and Lino Ventura. The old school. Why? They've got class! They could talk the talk, walk the walk, smoke a cigarette… There's something behind all that. It's class! The old Paris slang. The real Parisian slang. Belleville… All those guys. I really like them. They're the ones who inspire me. They're my inspiration. Gabin, Lino Ventura, Delon, Jean Lefebvre, Belmondo, all those guys. Depardieu. I love Depardieu in Danton. Especially Danton. That film… Depardieu's really strong inDanton. Does the Cours Simon give you a thrill? On the boards, you get a thrill! As soon as you set foot on stage, you're free! - That's what it's like? - Free! It feels good! There's nothing else… You play a character, it's incredible! Whatever the role? The role you played when I saw you was a role… I was so impressed by your work. Outside of that role, you could be anyone! Because I have no idea who the real Steve is. Of course. That's what I like about this work. Even when I walk around my neighborhood, I think, "If my pals only knew what I'm doing." Not to brag or anything but… I don't know. I can manage to do both things. On stage I play a role, outside I'm someone else. Because if they saw you on stage… They'd never recognize me. No way! No one. That's what's great about film and theater. They'd never recognize me on stage. For sure. Sometimes you seem incredibly preoccupied. You look really preoccupied. Are you preoccupied these days? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. A lot of things aren't going well at the moment. What, for example? The neighborhood. Things aren't great in the projects. - In the project? - Yeah. Whenever you try to get out… they give you more shit. There's always something. That's why the project's like a magnet. You can't… It's a magnet! It's fucked up. It's the past, too. Sometimes I think you gotta pay for the past. What do you mean? You know, I wasn't a sweet kid. I wasn't cool. I screwed up a lot but I managed not to get caught. Lots of stuff like that happened when I was young. And sometimes it comes back to haunt you. And you have to pay. But what happened this week? There was an armed robbery. In your neighborhood? Yeah, in my neighborhood. So there! And apparently I've been implicated. People I know were implicated. But someone implicated me. And I had nothing to do with it. I had nothing to do with it. I haven't stolen anything for 15… No, not 15. Ten. Ten years. I had nothing to do with it. I have no time for that. My life's taken a good turn. Why would I get mixed up in a heist? It makes no sense. I'm breaking into show business! It's not about going to… to jail or court that scares me. I'm scared of putting all my plans on hold. It's what's behind all that. My image… There's one place where my image is clean. What do you mean? At Cours Simon, in my mime class. Those people can see I'm clean. But you are clean! Of course! Of course, I'm clean! And I'd like to hold onto that image. In the projects, it's nothing. You do time for a few months, nobody gives a shit. If you're clean or dirty. If you're gone, you're gone. Nobody gives a shit if you're in the can. Life goes on. See what I mean? But at Cours Simon or in Paris, it's not like that. - The wild man's back! - Sorry. - What can I say? - No big deal. Sorry, Agathe. How are you? - Tuesday's okay. - We need you for La Cage aux Folles. When? Not this Tuesday, next Tuesday. Hi, bro. How's it going? Don't run off! Did I do something? Hi, Solen! You cool? Hi, Audrey. You okay? - Is Steve here? - Here I am! Why weren't you here the other day? What's up? I had a thing to take care of. Don't do me that way. You'll be here Tuesday? I have to see the scene! I don't have time. Having a baby, 'kay… "Okay." "Having a baby, okay." Be careful of the "'kays." "Okay!" When you think about, you say "okay." And when you don't, you say "'kay." And stop clutching that glass. It's just there. It's just in your hand. It seems like, without it, you're naked. It's just there. He puts it down whenever he needs to. Don't you get it? All your people are dead. As if you were dead, too. "As if you were dead!" Stand up straight. Don't slouch. That's a sign of weakness! Look at him! Deliver the lines slowly. Tighten up. He's dead! You don't need a gun. Listen! The day they think they can pounce on my empire, the day of their revenge, you'll be here! "The day of their revenge, you'll be here!" Emphasize the "here!" Then look at him. The kid stays on him. "How will I be there?" Listen! The day they think they can pounce on my empire, the day of their revenge, you'll be here! Look at him. - You'll speak my words! - You'll speak my words! Gently. "You'll act with my conscience." Slowly. Don't stumble over the lines. You'll speak my words, you'll move the way I teach you to move. And you'll stare them down the way I say to. And they'll see another me! As strong as I am. Even stronger, younger! And they'll go back into the shadows and bow once more! And I'll have won! Even in my grave, I'll win! I'll be you! Do it again, but with a smile. Make it even bigger. You've got the voice! I don't just want the Bronx to hear you through the windows, but all of New York! Remind him of who you are! You're the master! And when a reporter shows up in the bedroom and there's a war movie on TV, at one point he goes, "Kawasaki!" He's always a soldier! Oh, that film! You're young. Old men, like me, fear youth. They know it's the source of all gusts. They dread its strength, its courage. I don't like to be afraid. Not at all. Yet, I've been afraid for years. Even now, facing you. Despite your bloody face. I'm afraid. Don't think I'm a coward. That's got nothing to do with it. My fear of you is an old man's fear of the wind. I've thought at length about what I should do. And I've figured it out. This youth that makes me tremble, I just have to make an ally of it. So, don't worry, I won't kill you. You killed my whole family! Yes, your whole family's dead, we agree! Good, good work. Mr. Chesrin did a good job. He's progressed. In a scene like that… Mr. Tientcheu has progressed, too. The diction's a bit monotone, in general. A little… a little too one-note. As a tyrant, you don't really scare me yet. Because… there's something strong, powerful in barbarity. A spark is missing, a sudden… anger, an accent that… that comes out of your nature, that comes out of your experience, that you've yet to experience in that barbarity. It needs a touch of violence. But he's made progress in… his clarity of speech. But he still has to learn to impose himself. It's missing a bit of authority, for a scene and a character like that. So how are your classes going? It's getting harder and harder. Both in the work and with people in class. At least I have two or three pals in other classes. But I feel pretty much alone. I keep to myself. So… I'm the alley cat of the class. - What do you mean? - They're clean. I'm the tomcat. My coat's all matted. It's hardcore! So you feel like an alley cat, the tomcat? The tomcat. No, it's the truth. My teacher's flipping, too. It seems that people like us are unimaginable to them. Arabs, the projects, we're not… the idea… We're not part of the program. Film, theater, that's not for Arabs, blacks. For us! Maybe we can be rap singers or footballers or do the same job as Mom or Pop, street cleaners, but nothing more. We're not part of their program. The proof is they can't even find scenes for us. You teacher can't find scenes? He says, "Find some black scenes." Who's the teacher, me or him? That's not my job! Black scenes? The other day he said, "Don't you know any black authors?" - Why? - So he can give me those scenes. That's how lost the guy is! Because once you pass a certain stage… What's it called? What's it called? Those little scenes aren't enough. He has to move to the next level. Why? You can only play scenes by black writers? Who knows? I waited a year for a scene… I did a scene from "Battle of the Possessed." I had to wait a year for a black guy to play it with. For a year he said, "I don't have a black man." For a year! I said, "Look, it may take 15 years! "I'll go find someone in the projects." Then he found a white guy. He said, "We'll put him in blackface." See what I mean? The guy's really crazy! I said, "I'll get a black guy from the projects, no problem. "I'll give him the lines, he'll learn them. "I'll pay his tuition." He wanted to use a white guy in blackface? To play the scene with me. That's how they think! See how far gone these guys are? It's like when Columbus discovered America. I mean, give it a rest! Bye-bye. Just that stuff makes me… The same with Danton! They said no, Danton wasn't black. I mean, I'm there to work! I don't understand. What about Danton? I asked if I could do Danton. "No, impossible. There were no blacks back then." And when you hear stuff like that… It makes me crazy. Of course it makes me crazy. I'm an impulsive guy so… Either I'm bad or I shut my trap. So I shut my trap. 'Cause if I'm bad, I'm 100% bad. Then I'll wind up "punk of the month!" That drunk motherfucker who busts everything up! That'll be me! So I'd rather keep quiet. I've got no choice. I'm there to work. I like it. So that's how it's gotta be. That's what I tell myself. Fair or not. That's how it's gotta be. It's not fair. What else can I do? He makes the choices. The others can play whatever role they want and you… Yeah. Even white guys can play blacks in blackface. But I can't play white roles. It's insane. Even I don't get it. Why don't you tell him that? 'Cause then we'll discuss it to death and I'll get pissed off. After a certain point, I can't talk anymore. Let's see if there's a stool. - Baroche? - Here. - Jaquin? - Here. I love the smell of a new car! And you, Miss Daisy? Hawk, do you take me for an idiot? No, ma'am. I can see the speedometer from here. Yes, ma'am. My husband taught me about cars. I know that. I can see you're driving too fast! We're doing 30. - I like to stay under the limit. - The limit's 40 here. The slower you go, the less gas you use. My husband said so. But this way we'll get to the Piggly Wiggly faster. - Is this your car? - No, ma'am. - Do you pay for the gas? - No, ma'am. My son may think I'm losing my marbles, but I'm still boss in my car! I called you in today so we can review the work you've done in the third year class. First, I'd like to know what you yourself think. Well, the first year was fine. I came here empty-handed. I got along pretty well. The second year, too. But the third year's been kind of hard. I don't see much progress. I don't feel it anymore. So you feel that your progress has slowed down since the second year? Now there's more research. It's much more in-depth. I can see that's caused you problems. Fortunately. If it were easy, it wouldn't be much fun. But being unable to see your progress is normal, fortunately. We see it. These things are much more… fragile, but they exist. I can see it in the way you listen, the way you react, the nuances in your work. Those things carry a lot of weight. They're very precise - things you were incapable of doing a year ago. Incapable! I can assure you of that. Your progress - if we can call it progress is much subtler, subdued. You can't see it. Your foundation is your technique, which has evolved enormously. Even though you used to stammer, to go too fast, you didn't breathe – like all beginners. You didn't think about the lines before you delivered them. You've corrected all those mistakes beginners make. You still have stuff to work on. You still have to realize that you go a bit too fast. That you get ahead of yourself in the text. That you're not concentrated enough before delivering the author's words. You need to assert yourself in class, in the course. I know that's hard for you but you have to do it. You're accepted. You're 100% welcome. Don't stay on the sidelines, as you often do. You need to make more contact. It's better than last year. You were really terrified then. But you need to do more. It's also a way of being more a part of the group! The theater's a group. You don't perform alone. You have to be more present. It should be… There are scenes, the work we do on stage and the work we do with each other, which is just as important. That'll help you. Theater's an exchange. That's also important. And you have to strengthen that… - I won't say "family" aspect - here, with the others. But it's important to avoid systematically staying on the sidelines. I've rarely seen you so down. It's too… I don't know where I'm at. I don't know where I'm at anymore. I don't know anymore. It's all gone, I have no desire… I'm even getting crazy ideas, really crazy… I'm of no use anymore. To society, nothing. I'm of no use. For anything. Did something in particular happen or… It just hit me like… Like when I said I wanted to do theater. It hit me in just the same way. It came in just the same way. Did something disappoint you at the theater? Did someone criticize you? Your agent, your acting teacher? Were you disappointed? To just drop it, to have no desire for anything? It's me. It's not even the others. I'm the problem. I'm the problem. Nobody else. The others do what they have to do. I don't. I don't know how it happened. I don't understand. It's… It all just came up, just like that. I can't explain it. It's no one else. I'm the problem. No one else can deal with this problem, I'm the only one who can. If I don't do what has to be done, I won't advance. I don't have that thing my father had. My little brother's got it. I don't. What is that thing? The desire. Not to be afraid of… Other people are just like you. Not being a baby. I'm still a baby. I don't think you're a baby. Yes, I am. You just see me here. You don't see what's behind it all. I'm still a baby, you know. I feel like you have a complex… It's not the projects. It's everywhere. Even here, I don't look people in the eye. It's not some complex… With my friends, it's the same. It's not a complex. I can be a lot better but it's not that complex. That's how I am. I have no self-confidence. There! That's the thing. Once I have self-confidence, my life will change. Once I have self-confidence, things will change fast. I mean confidence everywhere. When I'm on stage, I won't need the teacher to tell me if it's good. I still need that after 2 ½ years of acting classes. There's a problem there. It's lots of stuff. Self-confidence. Knowing what you're talking about, why you're there. Still, what you're doing isn't insignificant. Not many guys manage to get out of the projects. You minimize it but what you've done isn't easy. Changing your milieu, moving into a new world, legitimizing yourself for the first time. Beyond the social question. All you have is yourself, your confidence. That's not easy. Don't you think it's time to talk to your friends about… To stop being the lonesome cowboy on the train into Paris. Maybe you thought you could take that on but 2 ½ years later you're out of breath. Don't you need to let it out, talk to people? To simply be able to express your doubts and… You often say you're afraid of the future. What is it you're afraid of? That I may not succeed. That I did it all for nothing. Shut up. I said shut up. I won't say it again. Good God, Lula, your head's empty. Empty. I could stab and strangle you. Watch you turn blue and beg for forgiveness. Just for fun. Yeah. And all those fags, half-drunk, sitting on their asses, behind newspapers leering at me. I could kill them all. Shut up, I said. For the last time. Calm down. Sit down. Calm down! That's all you can say. Look at you - hair slicked back, buttoned up to your chin. Your mouth full of white men's words! Don't get off your ass! That's what they expect. Stand up! Sit the fuck down! Go fuck yourself, Uncle Tom! Pig-headed Tom! Aren't you done yet? Let me go, you dirty black son of a bitch! Bastard! Shut up. I don't know what you're talking about. White folks scare you, huh? Huh, Uncle Tom! Pig-headed Tom! Just like your father. Black mouth, scared ass! I said to shut up! I won't say it again. Good God, Lula, your head's empty. Empty. I could stab and strangle you. Watch you turn blue and beg for forgiveness. Just for fun. And all those fags, half-drunk, sitting on their asses, hiding behind newspapers, leering at me. I could kill them all! I said to go easy with the monologue. I gave you rational reasons. You never listen. You're not angry, my poor friend. How can we get you to speak up, Mr. Tientcheu? Aren't you interested in this scene? Just say so. I don't get it. You don't wanna spit in her face. That's my criticism. That's what I want. You can do what you want. Watch them to see if any of them move. That's not even in his interest. I'm not asking you to play it on the subway. But if you did, you'd see the fear. Don't back down, see it through! They don't move. They don't move! We have to have the impression that… That's why you can go for it at the end, sir. But watch the others. They don't move either. That's it! It's not her. A couple of slaps and she's done for! Your grandfather didn't go to college. He was a plantation slave! He was a night watchman. Stay over there. "My grandfather was a night watchman!" Take it up a notch. My grandfather was a night watchman. And you? Who do you take yourself for? I used to think I was the next Baudelaire, but now… I aim lower. I'll bet you never even realized you were just a nigger! A dirty black nigger! "I'll bet you never knew "you were just a dirty, fucking, black nigger." That I like. And all those fags, half-drunk, sitting on their asses, hiding behind newspapers, leering at me. I could kill them all! - Idiot. - Shut up, I said! For the last time. You dream of being a Hollywood hooker. Luxury. That's all you think about! It's written all over your face, your hands, your ass. Don't tell me what to say or do. No advice, no orders. "No advice! No orders!" "I love Bessie Smith!" You never realized that Bessie Smith was singing… - Easy. - "Here's my ass! "Here's my big black ass!" She's not singing about love. It's not desire or sorrow. Not at all what you'd think. That's too violent. "She's not singing about love. "It's not desire or sorrow. "Not what you'd think. Not the blues. No." She's not singing about love. It's not desire or sorrow. It's not at all what you'd think. She's saying, right out loud, "My big black ass says fuck you!" And turning their backs on logic, blacks went crazy. They just needed one tiny thing. "They just needed one tiny thing. "One little jab, to ignite it all." Think. I don't want that. I told you, he's a pacifist. But given the tension at that time, in the '60s in the United States, things were brewing. It wouldn't take much. And then they'd see. Whereas they just needed one tiny thing. One little jab, an insignificant murder, and everything would be back in place. Black people, my people, don't need me to express themselves. Easy. "Black people! "My people don't need me to express themselves!" They've got their ideas, their arms and legs. Fight for the cause! Bodily! Defend it! You're sick of this! What's up, bro? You fat slob, why'd you make me come down? Don't jump down my fuckin' throat like that. Take it easy, bro. I'm in a hurry. Fill me in, what up, man? No, man, I told you I was gettin' trained in audiovisual stuff… Well, for three years now, I've been studying acting. - No? - Yeah, 3 years. Yeah! Really, bro? I've been studying for 3 years. Now I'm done. Tomorrow's my last day. Tomorrow I'm playing in Paris. If you wanna come, come. Bring the guys. - Yo, bro! - No biggie! You gonna be a comic? What's this training? No, it's not comic, it's not funny. It's so I can be a real actor. - You like that? - It's great! You doin' what you like? Cool! I'm happy for you, man! You tight-lipped bastard! No way! - You're the best, bro! - No. That's it! You don't say anything! Don't you trust me? You know how it is here. If I tell guys, they say, "Think you're hot shit? Get lost!" You know how it is! I can't talk about that shit! You trippin'? No way! You know how they are! If I tell you and Khaley, it's for a reason. I told Warzozo last week, he was like, "That's great, man!" I told him everything. I got an agent. An agent saw me on stage. So that's that. I had to tell you. I got my license. I'm not too hot about being a truck driver! Good job, bro! I'm really happy for you. That's all there is. So, bro, what's your… you get to act with big stars or what? I don't know. I've got nothing yet. You know me, bro. Don't say that! Just tell me straight. For the moment, I've got zilch. We'll see. I hope something'll open up. Things just happen. The little bird builds its nest. - The milieu… - You'll make a big nest! I need one! A bee's nest. - A wasp's nest. - Full of honey! You said it! I'm really happy for you. No, it's great. I'm happy. Congratulations! You're not asleep. That's good! We're 27, going on 28! It's now or never, career-wise! Good. You're planning ahead. You were right to keep it under wraps. But you did it. I remember you were worried. You'll see! But I never thought you were acting! You shocked me. I swear, this is too cool! I'm happy for you. It's nothing! It's to be expected. Good luck. See what happens when you get outta this dump! As soon as you get out of this shit hole! You don't see anything the same. Just getting this far, to me, you've succeeded. Not everybody could do that. They'd say, "It's a waste of time." It cost me 310 euros a month. Otherwise, you'd have wasted it on drugs or whatever… Booze! At least, you invested it in yourself. You've learned stuff, you talk different, you've got new contacts. That's fucking useful! I swear, congratulations! I'm happy for you. You don't wear tights or anything?! If only you knew! I once had a scene… I'll spare you! I'll cue you again. Then there's a music cue. It's starting! It's my nature. I was made to love. We should never have separated, Robespierre. The Revolution taught me a lot. Not me! That's the nature of things. I don't believe in things. I believe in people. Nevertheless, our convictions are the same. Can't friends differ? Not if it threatens the Republic! I, Danton, I threaten the existence of the Republic! When your friends attack the state security committee. Is the committee infallible? The Republic has no solid base yet. Let's let bygones be bygones, for the sake of France. It's needs, it's dangers! Excuse me, ma'am. Do you know this guy? This guy! Yes, I know him. - What do you think of him? - I like him a lot. He's a doll! A lovely scene tonight. - We came for him. - A lovely scene. He looks good! I love the smell of a new car! And you, Miss Daisy? Do you take me for an idiot? I can see the speedometer. Yes, I know. You're driving too fast! We're doing 30. I like to stay under the limit. The limit's 40 here. The slower you go, the less gas you use. My husband said so. This way we'll get to the Piggly Wiggly faster. Is this your car? Do you pay for the gas? No, ma'am. My son may think I'm losing my marbles, but I'm still boss in my car! Yes, ma'am. Miss Daisy, what does it look like? What are you talking about? Well… I can't read. I can't read. Everyone can read! Not me. Miss Daisy, I won't do the middle. No, that'll be enough. You may go. Stop laughing, we can't hear. And don't tell me you can't do it. You can! How's it going? Congratulations, man! Great job! Yeah, Miss Daisy! Awesome, man! Great! You were great! Really, congratulations! Come on, let's go out. - Did your mom come? - No. Yes, ma'am, Miss Daisy! Really… Did you take off that white thing? You blew us away! You look like Uncle Ben! You're like a real old-fashioned actor! Classy! Even though those bastards made you play the Negro role, as usual, you really did it well! Don't scream, please. I swear, I wanted to kill you, the way you were laughing! He wanted you to know he was there! I know, I heard you. I was happy. I thought, "Who's laughing so hard?" I thought, "That's him!" I swear! No big deal. It's great that you're here, bros! Are you done? Let's take off. Go get your stuff. I'll be right back. Hey, stay there! Stay with your classmates! At Cours Simon! They came to see you and you take off. You're ungrateful! You're really ungrateful! We've shattered the tyranny of the privileged by abolishing powers that no man has a right to. We've put an end to the monopoly of birth, the monopoly of wealth, in all state functions. In our churches, in our armies, in all parts of this magnificent body that is France. Now the most humble man is equal to the greatest. That liberty we've acquired for ourselves, we have extended to slaves. And we appeal to the world to build the future in the spirit of hope that we've created. It's more than victorious battles, swords and canons, and all the cavalries of Europe. And that inspiration, that breath for mankind, everywhere, in every place, that appetite, that thirst for liberty, can never be extinguished. Danton's last speech, Paris 1794
