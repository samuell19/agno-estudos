HE'S PLAYING WITH ME NOW. AND I CAN'T PROVE SHIT. DOES THAT SOUND LIKE SOMEONE WHO'S OBSESSED? ( both laugh ) OPEN THE DOOR! STEP THROUGH! EVEN WITH THE AUTHORIZED RELEASE FROM THE COURTS, THIS HAS TO BE STRICTLY VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE PRISONER. GEE, YOU THINK HE'LL CHOOSE TO STAY HERE? COME ON, MAN. MAKE THAT GOODBYE MOVE. IT'S OVER. ( chatter, laughter ) CHECK. All: OH, YEAH! ( enthused chatter ) WILL YOU DUMB SCHOOLGIRLS SHUT UP? ( chatter stops ) YOU LEFT YOUR QUEEN UNPROTECTED.

YOU'RE THE CLOSEST THING TO A FRIEND OF JIMMY RAY'S I COULD FIND. YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE CROSSING AN OLD CELLMATE? JIMMY RAY IS A PSYCHOPATH. YOU SAVED HIS LIFE IN HERE. WHY? WAIT A MINUTE. IF SOME GUY WANTS TO TAKE THE HIGH HARD ONE UP THE KEISTER, THAT'S FINE WITH ME SO LONG AS IT'S HIS IDEA. BUT FIVE-ON-ONE WAS NOT HIS IDEA; THEY WERE GONNA RAPE HIM OR KILL HIM. YOU'RE A MORAL CRUSADER? NO. NO, I AM WHAT IS KNOWN AS A FUCKING IDIOT. BECAUSE A WEEK LATER, THE LAUNDRY ROOM SOMEHOW CAUGHT ON FIRE AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE GOT BURNED. MAYBE IF I HADN'T-- DO WE HAVE A DEAL? HERE'S THE SET-UP. IF YOU CROSS ME AND RUN, I WILL DEVOTE MY LIFE TO FINDING YOU AND BLOWING YOUR HEAD OFF. I'M NOT GONNA RUN, OSCAR. YOU HAVE MY WORD. IS THIS KIND OF A PERSONAL THING WITH YOU AND JIMMY RAY? JUST DOIN' MY JOB. UH-HUH. WELL, YOU'RE THE EXPERT HERE, BUT YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE SUSPICIOUS WHEN I GREET HIM WEARING HANDCUFFS? FUNNY.

OUR MAN THERE WILL TELL HIM ALL HE NEEDS TO KNOW-- ACCIDENTLY. OSCAR, THOSE ROCKS BETTER BE REAL. JIMMY RAY KNOWS HIS DIAMONDS. I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT IN THE HEAD WHEN HE OPENS THAT SACK. UNLESS THEY'RE REAL, I CAN'T BUST HIM. WHAT ELSE DID YOU FIND OUT TODAY? LIKE ON THE HORSE TRAIL, FOR INSTANCE. WHY DO I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING ME, OSCAR?

YOU KNOW, A LITTLE NOURISHMENT IS PROBABLY NOT A BAD IDEA. ( sighs ) MY GOD. ( starts car ) IT WAS STUPIDITY, REALLY. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID MY OLD MAN DIED, AND SOMETIMES I THINK HE DIED JUST TO GET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER. BUT ANYWAY, WE WERE POOR, I WAS ALWAYS BROKE, WORKING MY WAY THROUGH SCHOOL, AND I WAS JUST SICK OF EVERYTHING. SO I GOT AHOLD OF THESE GUYS FROM THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THEY HAD A PLAN. AND LIKE AN IDIOT, I GET DRUNK, GET A GUN-- IT WASN'T EVEN LOADED-- I MEAN, IT WAS REALLY STUPID. MUST BE HORRIBLE TO BE LOCKED AWAY LIKE THAT. THE FIRST TWO YEARS, I DON'T KNOW... BUT I STARTED TO EDUCATE MYSELF. I SET GOALS. THE THIRD YEAR I DECIDED I'D READ ALL THE RUSSIANS-- CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, OF COURSE, WAR AND PEACE-- WHAT'S THE MATTER? I'M BORING YOU, RIGHT? NO. I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS HAPPENING SO FAST. YOU COULD REALLY HURT ME. I'LL NEVER HURT YOU, JULIA. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T TRUST PEOPLE. YOU CAN TRUST ME. YOU CAN. YOU CAN.

AND WHATEVER SHE'S TELLING YOU, SHE'S NEVER GONNA LEAVE JIMMY RAY. MAYBE I JUST TRUST PEOPLE MORE THAN YOU DO, OSCAR. OH, MAN. HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED IT OUT? THE WOMAN IS A LIAR. ( runs faucet ) YOU REALLY LIKE THIS CRYSTAL, HUH? I MEAN, I GIVE YOU A $20 NECKLACE, AND YOU ACT LIKE IT'S A DIAMOND. IT'S WHAT IT MEANS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. NOT THAT. HA HA! I ONLY WEAR THIS WHEN I'M ALONE. CLOSE YOUR EYES. DON'T LAUGH. I MADE IT WHEN I WAS LITTLE. PUT OUT YOUR HAND. OPEN? YEAH. WOW! IT'S AN INDIAN NECKLACE, HUH? YEAH. IT'S KIND OF SILLY. YOU MADE THAT?

ARE YOU GONNA BLOW THIS THING OVER SOMETHING YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND? I WARNED YOU. AND NOW YOU'RE MESSING WITH MY LIFE. OSCAR, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THERE'S A REAL DARKNESS IN YOU, ISN'T THERE? YOU'RE ATTRACTED TO THE DARK. I WARNED YOU, BUT HERE YOU ARE-- A BRAINLESS BUG FLYING HAPPILY INTO THE WEB, BECAUSE YOU... LIKE IT ON THE DARK SIDE! YOU ARE CRAZY, OSCAR, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU ARE SICK. IF TOMORROW GOES RIGHT, YOU'RE FREE. BUT IF YOU FUCK THIS UP OVER HER... I WON'T PUT YOU BACK IN JAIL. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? JULIA TOLD ME YOU WERE COMING ON TO HER! ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH HER? OHH! YOU SON OF A BITCH. I KNEW YOU WERE LYING TO ME! HA HA HA! BUT I NEVER THOUGHT IT COULD BE ABOUT JULIA. AHHH! YOU KNOW SOMETHING? WOMEN BEATERS SCARE ME. GIRLFRIEND GETS A LITTLE CONFUSED SOMETIMES, HUH? FUCKIN' ASSHOLE. FUCKING ASSHOLE. ( chuckles ) SHE'S MINE! UNDERSTAND? MINE! REMEMBER THAT, BOY.

I DON'T HATE YOU, BUT THIS CANNOT BE SAFE. DON'T MAKE ME GO. HE'S ASLEEP. PLEASE, I KNOW THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. JIMMY TOLD ME THAT YOU JUST WANTED TO FUCK ME. JULIA, THAT SON OF A BITCH HAD A GUN TO MY HEAD AT THE TIME. COME ON. OH, MY GOD. OH, GOD, I COULD HAVE LOST YOU. (crying) I'M SORRY. IT'S OKAY. DO YOU FORGIVE ME? YEAH, I FORGIVE YOU. YEAH. YOU DO? OH, BABE. COME HERE. YOU'VE NEVER HAD ANYBODY WHO LOVED YOU AND CARED FOR YOU THE WAY I DO, BABY. YEAH. BUT I DO. I REALLY DO. IT'S SUCH A STRANGE THING THAT'S GOING ON. A WEEK AGO I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE ALIVE, AND NOW I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER LIVE WITHOUT YOU. LET'S JUST RUN AWAY FROM HERE, LET'S JUST GO. HE'S ASLEEP, LET'S JUST GO RIGHT NOW. I CAN'T. WHY? YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS ROBBERY. YES, I HAVE TO. WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND! SHH! SHH! QUIET! LISTEN TO ME. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I HAVE TO DO THIS? BECAUSE THE FBI GOT ME OUT OF JAIL!

YOU AND I ARE GONNA DISAPPEAR, BABY. IS IT OSCAR? HOW DO YOU KNOW OSCAR? HE'S BEEN AFTER JIMMY RAY SINCE I MET HIM. RIGHT. LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MATTER. NOW, THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.... WHERE WERE YOU? WITH TEDDY. AND? AND I FOUND OUT WHAT YOU WANTED. YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS, JIMMY. HE'S WORKING FOR THE FBI. THEY'RE GONNA COME ARREST US TOMORROW. GOD IN HEAVEN. I KNEW HE WAS LYING TO ME. YOU PROMISE ME, JIMMY. YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS. YOU GOTTA KEEP ME SAFE. OH, I'M GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT ALL RIGHT, HONEY. I'M GONNA GO THROUGH WITH IT. JIMMY, IT'S THE FBI. YOU THINK I'M SCARED OF THEM? ( laughs ) WELL DONE. GOOD WORK. GOOD WORK. GOOD WORK. Jimmy Ray (distant): YOU FUCKING TOLD ME, MAN. YOU FUCKIN' LIED TO ME! YOU DID! KANSAS CITY! IT'S NOT GOING DOWN THE WAY I TOLD YOU IT WAS. FORGET IT! JULIA TOLD ME. YEAH. T.C. IS WORKING FOR THE FBI. ( Jimmy continues, indistinct ) ( door slams in distance ) ( gasps ) OH, GOD, TEDDY. YOU'RE EARLY, MAN. ( chuckles ) LET'S GO. WHICH DOOR IS IT? THE TOP OF THE STAIRS. LOCK UP ALL EXITS. THEY'RE ON THE ROOF. Teddy: RIGHT ON TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO? YEAH. SAM. CAN YOU SEE THEM? THEY MOVED BEHIND THE TRUCK. COME ON, BOYS! WAIT A MINUTE. THIS ISN'T THE WAY OSCAR HAD IT PLANNED. SHUT UP! DIAMONDS IN THE BOX? YEAH. EVERYBODY MOVE IN NOW! HANDS THROUGH THE MIRROR BRACKET. HANDCUFF 'EM. ( starts, revs motorcycle ) GET OSCAR. NOW! WE GOT JIMMY RAY, BUT COOPER IS GONE. AND SO ARE THE DIAMONDS. SHIT! GODDAMNIT! OHH! THAT'S IT! SUSPENSION, PENDING INVESTIGATION. YOU NEVER LISTEN, OSCAR. WE TRACED COOPER TO TORONTO, FENCING SOME OF THE DIAMONDS. HE'S IN CHINATOWN. I'LL GET THE SON OF A BITCH, AND THE DIAMONDS BACK. ( sighs ) ( chuckles ) T.C. ♪ ONLY YOU AND YOUR TOUCH ♪ CAN CURE MY ♪ JEALOUS HEART ♪ YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME, I SUPPOSE ♪ BUT THEN YOU-- Ben: EXCUSE ME, MR.DANKER. THIS GENTLEMAN SAYS HE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF YOURS. WELL, WELL, WELL. WE HAVE COMPANY, DARLIN'. JULIA SOMERS, MEET OSCAR PIERCE. YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK OF HIM. MISS SOMERS. I'VE ENJOYED YOUR SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL. HA HA HA HA! WELL, OSCAR, I'D POUR YOU A DRINK... ONLY I DON'T WANT TO. NOW, YOU... AND YOUR F-B-FUCKIN'-I DECIDED I COULD NOT BE PROSECUTED. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? AH...I NEED YOUR HELP. COOPER'S BEEN TRACED SELLING OFF SOME OF THE DIAMONDS. HELP ME GET THEM BACK AND I WILL FORGET I EVER HEARD OF YOU, AND YOU CAN SETTLE THINGS WITH COOPER ANY WAY YOU WANT. ( laughs) ( continues laughing ) ANY WAY I WANT? OSCAR... JUST HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK I AM? LOOK! ASS-WIPE... GETTING THOSE DIAMONDS BACK IS THE TICKET TO MY LIFE. NOW, I COULD KILL COOPER TODAY, BUT IT WON'T GUARANTEE GETTING THOSE DIAMONDS BACK. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE LURED INTO GIVING THEM OVER. AND YOU...HAVE THE ONLY THING HE WANTS. NO. NO, JIMMY, I WON'T DO THAT. (laughs) YOU SEE, OSCAR? YOU SEE... HOW THIS LITTLE EPISODE WITH TEDDY COOPER HAS INTERFERED WITH MY OTHERWISE PERFECT RELATIONSHIP WITH MS. SOMERS? NOW, DARLING, OSCAR'S OFFERING TO FINALLY LEAVE ME ALONE. AND I'M GONNA GET T.C.

ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ALONE. NOW... ...WHAT'S IT GONNA BE? JULIA? JULIA. JULIA. Teddy: I ONLY RECENTLY STARTED THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS, THE DARKNESS, MAKING AN EFFORT TO MOVE TOWARDS THE LIGHT. I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR CONVERSATIONS, BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU. THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN AFRAID TO TELL YOU. I STOLE SOMETHING... VERY VALUABLE. BUT I DECIDED I WANT TO RETURN IT SO I CAN STAY WITH YOU AND LEARN WITH A CLEAN SLATE. YOU ARE MAKING PROGRESS. YOU ARE ALREADY TEACHING YOURSELF. TAKE THIS BOOK. IT WILL HELP YOU. BY THE WAY, DID I MENTION THAT I COMMUNICATED WITH MEMBERS OF THE POLICE UP HERE? IT SEEMS THEY'RE EXTREMELY UNDERPAID, SO IT TOOK A BIT OF MY SAVINGS. BUT IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, MOTHERFUCKER, BEFORE I GET THOSE DIAMONDS, YOU TWO WILL BE FOUND LYING FACE DOWN IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY. IT WOULD PAIN ME TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. ( car horn honks ) HE'S BACK. OKAY, TELL ME AGAIN. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. JUST GET THE DIAMONDS. UNDERSTAND? THEN HE'S A DEAD MAN. GO AHEAD AND GET DRESSED. ( Oscar chuckling ) ( footsteps ) TEDDY? IT'S JULIA.

YOU'RE EVERYWHERE, EVERY MOMENT, EVERY MINUTE, EVERY BREATH. TEDDY, YOU'VE BEEN INSIDE OF ME. IT DOESN'T GO AWAY. AND IF I CAN'T BE WITH YOU, THEN I WANT TO BE DEAD. WELL, WHAT DO YOU GOT? PAIR OF EIGHTS. PAIR OF NINES. ( laughing ) WELL, UH, HE HASN'T THROWN HER OUT, SO IT MUST BE WORKING. I GUESS. I GOTTA HIT THE CAN. DO I TRUST YOU, OR DO I HANDCUFF YOU?
