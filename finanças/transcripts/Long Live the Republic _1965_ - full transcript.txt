I was afraid I'd never grow up and they'd call me Midget for my whole life. It's high, maybe 2000 metres. Probably observing. Yea, that's what you care about. Useless stuff. Here. And don't go to Vitlich's, leave the dogs alone. -No. -Tell him you want half a can. -Ok. Be careful. Don't fall down. Don't worry. I know how to ride this. Good morning. Kadera, Cumat, Rez and Vasak. Europe's biggest nitwits. Toot! Toot! -Midget, hey, Midget. -Where're you going? Hey guys. -Short legs, Midget! -You can't reach the pedals! I can. Easy. Is that you grandpa's bike? Cumat the stupid, Kadera the crooked. Vasak, you hay-sack. Rez lives in a smelly gas. I always imagined great things. No, please, Midget... Look at yourself! -He flew like an angel. -Hey, Angel! Morning, mister Kadera. He acts like all the roads belong to him. Mr.Petrzela. My dad says that what he doesn't steal, he doesn't have. And he has everything. Now you're in a hurry. You can sew a million of these flags, if you want to. People will be cross anyway. Can you hear me? -Oh yeah. I've got my ears. -Morning. I'd like 2 crowns worth a whitewash. -For how much? -Two crowns. You might as well have gone to the pharmacy for that. -Is that Russian or German? -Messerschmidt. -Yeah? -A fighter plane. The two crowns? Half of the can, my dad said. If your dad keeps saving like this, he'll be the next Rotschild. Business with you... Cyril! Cyril! Come here, come... Cyril! This village has fulfiled all its obligations towards the Reich You expecting a Russian? Where have you been? At a limestone pit? -Petrzela wasn't home. -I was looking for you there! Don't beat him on the street. This pennyworth for two crowns? Typhus Julina! -father: where is the boy? -mother: Oldrich! Oldrich! Good boy. Hi. -Go home, Midget! -Had a good crash, eh? You did. Get the hell out, you brats. Ruda is busy. -Get out of here! -We're going, mr.Niklik. -Goodbye, mr.Niklik. -Goodbye. -Go back to your mum. -Yeah, come back when you grow up! Want me to kick your seat? No! No! Quiet. Dad, I'll walk the dog. Aga! -Stop whistling, idiot? -Why is Midget here? Take me with you, guys. -You can't. -Why? Come on, guys! Get him down! Aaah! -Can you hear that? -What? -Again. -I can hear it. I hear it. -The artillery. It's from the front. -You hear it better on the ground. -How far can you hear these guns? -Fifty kilometres. -Who said so? -Cmiral. -He's a sod. Fall down. Die. Aaah... Come. Dimwits. Can you see the bridge? The magnifying is great. Look, the tanks. -Right under me. -Give it to me. -Wait. The planeman watches the bridge. Russians could bomb it. Two, four, six... eight of them. Maybe they'll burn down the village. I'd like to see that. No, twelve. One more. Thirteen. I wouldn't let them lock me in a cellar. No way. -When do we get a chance to see another war? -Maybe the school burns down. And the headmaster dies. -You've put it up wrong. -Someone must have taken it! The shoes are gone too. -The asshole is here. -You're an asshole. Oldrich, Oldrichm, come out. We won't hurt you. -I'll beat him up. -Me too. Don't be afraid. Come put the ladder back up. He can't. He is too weak to lift it. Rez lives in a cloud of gas! Go and join the army, they'll send you back to mommy. Get out, Midget, I'm counting to five! -One, two... -Three, four, Hundred, Million. No ladder for you. Cumat, you stupid. Kadera, I'll peach upon you. You threw that on your uncle's grave. Call yourself a ministrant? Come back. Hear me? Don't be afraid. Come put up the ladder! Oldrich, where are you? Mom... Oldrich! Oldrich! One day you'll kill him. And they lock you up for that. Brother fire marshal, the fire brigade is ready for practice. Thank you. Line up. Leave the hoses alone! Quick! Bertyna: No, don't... Selma! Selma! -Hi, Cyril. -Hey, Dog-ear, what are you doing here? I went to see the puppies . There'll be shooting. You should have stayed at home. -They'll shoot your head off. -I'm not afraid. Are you? Goddamn, Oldrich, what have you done? I ran away from him. You did? Some news. For how long? Forever. I'm not coming back. Never. Right, why would you, anyway. Come. -He drowned the puppy you'd given me. -Come, Dog-ear. I'll warm some soup for you. I shot five ravens yesterday. A fine soup from them. Cyril, you ran away too, when you were young, didn't you? No. I made it up. I was showing off in front of you, Oldrich. No, you ran away. You only came back when you were twenty. When your father died. Did I tell you that? Come. -Selma! -He shot her from a car. Have you seen anyone on the road to here? The crowd already coming? -What kind of crowd? -Forget it. Find a spade. We'll make a funeral. We'll bury her. Do people already know that they're gone? Did your father not send you to check it out here? Why? I was with the boys. By the church. -Where do we bury her? -At the back. Just a minute. -Anyone banging on the door? -It's the artillery. -Did Singer have a lot of money? -Well he was no beggar. Are you looking for someting, Cyril? You can measure yourself. Why are you burning it? To keep warm. -Aren't you cold? -No. Let's go. -Why are you doing this? -It's just a play, see? No it isn't. -Have I ever lied to you? -You always do. You'll grow up a clever chap, Oldrich. They're guarding the bridge. So that the Russians don't blow it up. Do you want to take something home to your father? But these thing aren't yours. You certainly don't take after your father. Nor after your grandpa. -You don't recall him, do you? -No. Did you know him? I did. He was the biggest penny pincher ever. He'd rather shit his pants than manure someone else's field. You should look up to him. He was an honest, hard-working man. Until his death. We'll bring the candle back next time. Someone could steal it from here. -Not true. He wasn't a penny pincher. -He certainly could manage money. He stole what he could steal. At sixty, he was still chasing rabbits. I almost thought they wouldn't come. Who the hell has locked this? Someone must have been here before us. I can imagine their stupid sons at their places. Climb over it. I'll break in. Maybe someone is still there. Can you see them? -Yeah. -Remember them well. Why are they here? You'll have a hard life, lad. Anyone here? Hey! Anyone here? Quiet. Stop yelling. Where are the wheels? Cyril, how did you know they'd come for the carts? I dreamed about it, at night. I'd love to see the clever bastard who was here before. I should have thought so. Clever as a bishop, you are. Come and help me load this. This one's mine. I found it for myself. Perhaps if we share the engine. Oh yeah. Why did I take you with. I should have kept my mouth shut. But they have their own carts, don't they. You really don't take after your grandfather. Don't think about her anymore. I'll give you one of the puppies. You'll see. Is that anyone from your family? Good. I found it. On the road. Do you smoke? Sometimes. If your father finds this, he'll knock your head off. Oldrich, Oldrich! Oldrich, come home, come to bed. Oldrich, it's late. You'll catch a cold there. You have no coat, you'll freeze. Come inside. Oldrich, please, come in. Can you hear me? -Is dad home? -He's asleep already. -He isn't. -I'm telling you he is. -You always say so. -Don't shout. Come. -Will he beat me? -He won't. You always say that. Mom? -Where have you been again, you brat? -Don't beat him! I'll sort it out with him. You would kill him. Well? You going to do something or should I take over? Hit me. Hit me. Hit me! Go to sleep now. That's it now. What are we going to do? They would certainly take your horse away, for sure. Who said the Russians will take horses? -Everybody says that. -The vicar was told by the Germans. -That's it now. -We're sending the horses to the woods. All the way back to the rocks. The boys will take them there. -The boys? The small ones? -Who else? One must stay around the house. What if there is a fire? Alright. Neither them nor the others will hurt the boys. Alright. Oldrich, Oldrich! Get up. You're going somewhere! -He's waiting for you already. -Should I wake the young gentleman up? No, he's awake already. What are you doing? Did you cough at night? I'm not going with the boys. Not with them sods. -You didn't sweat at night? -I told you I don't cough anymore. Don't shit your pants, alright? You'll take the old road, cross the wooden bridge. All the others will go that way. The hay and oats are on the cart. Mom, give him some bread and grease. -Which way are you going again? -The old road, cross the wooden bridge. All the others will go that way. The hay and oats are on the cart. Mom will give me bread and grease. Oldrich! Why? Here. Two cups of oats in the morning and in the evening. Hay at noon. And water as much as she wants. Hear me? Yeah, I do. -You remember the way? -Cross the bridge. -Go! -Careful about the horse. -Oldrich, take care about yourself. And if you meet the Germans, tell them "lch verstehe nicht". Baaa! Buuu! Go! Go! Quiet.

Go to the stall. Count the horsehair. Oldrich, can't you lend him some? Kadera will make me go bankrupt if I don't pay him back. Now he'll get my meadow for a few crowns and everything else. You should lend him something. What can he do? I myself am in trouble. Am I a bank or something? You know she's ill and they can't afford the treatment. Jesus Christ, that's a life.

Cyril! Vitlich has hanged herself! Come, Midget! Run away! Mr.Vitlich, Mr.Vitlich! Who are you, brat? A king or a chimney sweep? Cyril! Iza! -Come on, don't you get anything to eat? -I feed them. Watch out, someone can take your horse away. You know your father. He'd have a stroke, at least. They fly no more. They let the bridge be. Cyril, were you in Vrbovna? Where that motorcycle is? What did I tell you? I told you to hurry up! -Can you hear anything? -No. What? They're gone. These are gone. The Russians will be here in no time. Cyril, may I take Iza with me to the forest? Are you scared? A little bit, right? Alright then. Thank you, Cyril. Iza, come! Be careful, Oldrich! Cumat, Kadera, Vasak and Rez are stupid elephants. -What is it? Whoa! Got him! We've got you, Midget! Who? You? You'd have to try harder for that. Go! Go! Go! Whoa! Halt! -Give it up, Midget! -Go! Go! Vasak, you're a dead man now! Move away, Vasak, or else you're dead! Whoa! Vasak, hay-sack! Hey, Midget, stop! It will be worse for you when we catch you. Yea? When is that gonna happen? Halt! Whoa! -Stop, you idiot. Can't you see it's sown on the field? -It's our rye, Midget! -Stop chasing me then. -Stop! -Where're you going? -Midget! -Stop it, you asshole! -Go! -Go! Halt! Whoa! Halt! -The Russians! The Russian planes! -Are they Russian? -Haven't you seen the stars? -I've seen the machine guns. -Four machine guns. -No way, silly. These were bombers. -Oh my! -They're flying to Brno. Really, Kadera? Since when is Brno in that direction? Since yesterday? -You're still here? -Leave me alone, guys. Vasak, I'll give you a cigarette case with a photo in it, how do you like it? You take a picture of yourself. To see how you looked before the beating. -There's a motorcycle. I know where. -You do? And what about yesterday's ladder? Where is that one? -We've got to slap you a bit. -But not Cumat. No, not me. I'll kick you instead. Go! -Slap you ten times, Midget! -Five! Ten! Stop! You're making it worse! Go! Go! Go! We've got you, Midget! Go! Go! Hey, Midget! You'll kill yourself! Stop it! What's wrong? Drink. It's clean now. Good. Hey, you've had enough. You're doing that on purpose. Go! Go!

The bells have flown to Rome. Stop following me! Why didn't you bite them? Julina! To the cart! Check that the wheels are oiled properly. Do you want me to drive, dad? You better wipe your nose and hold on tight. Go! Whoa! Iza, where did they go? Search! I thought they were dead. I thought people don't sleep in a war. Just let me dress and I'll go immediately. Daddy! You'll have two sons before you're twenty. (in Russian) Kuda ty? Lazis! Stop! Stop! (in Russian) Stop, I'm telling you! What? Never seen a horse before? The Germans. You Slovak? Austrian? No?

I'm not your son, so stop hitting me! There are Russians at the farm already. It looks like they're early. The Germans stole Julina from me. -What did they steal? -The horse. -You're kidding. I'm not going home. Never. -Where did you get this one? -I found it. The Germans have destroyed the bridge, did you know? -It's been blown to pieces. -Hm. What's wrong with it, Cyril? Just about everything. Wipe your nose. -Where did they take Julina? -Towards Rynovce. Through the woods. Wipe your nose. -Hey, can't you blow your nose? -I have no handkerchief. Can't you do it without a handkerchief? -I don't need to blow my nose. -There's a bubble coming out of it. -What? -Your nose is running. Yeah, silly jokes, you are an expert on that. Show me. -Where did you find it? -I've got it. -Who distributes stuff like this? -The Russians. -Cyril, what is a lieutenant? -Have you been there? -Hm. Got a mirror? What am I supposed to do with the puppies if you don't come back? Who shall I give them to? I can't have my house full of dogs. Cover yourself well. The dog is not cold. Sleep now. -Cyril, is a horse more expensive than a motorbike? -Just sleep. We'll find Julina. -They probably didn't get far. Must have left the horse and cart somewhere. -Did your father say anything about me? -No. What kind of anything? Or Cumat. Old Cumat. He comes to your place often, doesn't he?
