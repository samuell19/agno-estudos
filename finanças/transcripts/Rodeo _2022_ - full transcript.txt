The fuck you want? Move! Who's going to fix it? - I will fuck you guys up! - Cool it. Get off of me. Where are you going? Quit busting my balls! C'mon, stay here. Back off! - Stay here. Where are you running? - Bastards! Come back here! Marvin! What do you want? I am going to work. - We has got to talk. - Fast. Where are you going? Back off, will you! Hold your sister. They picked the lock, stole my bike. They fucked my door, bro. - This fool was fast asleep. - I sleep at night. He works, so he sleeps. You're out at night... My bike, bro! - So what? - Gimme a ride! - Get in the truck. - We are not going nowhere. - Where you going? - Get lost. Where are you going? Get out! - No way. - We are not going nowhere! - Out! - No! - Let us go! - You force me. Back off Marvin. - Ballbuster. - You are embarrassing. So they punk me and I get all the shit. - Shit sticks to you! - Go to work. It was not my fault. You know the deal. Break it, buy it. I did not break shit. He knocked me over! He who not let it go and you know it. - Go home now. - No way! What do I do with no bike? Shut it now! Go home or I will clock ya! You are nobody. What you doing? Fuck off! Seriously, you bust my balls. Relax. Okay, calm now? It is cool. Let go of me. Let us go! Quit pulling this shit. Straight up! Can I get to work now? If I am calm, will you give me a ride? This is the last time, got it? Morning. - Here about the bike? - That's right. Mister... FR33 on eBay. Nice to meet you. Let us go on the road. Do not want it to slip. This is the beast! Beautiful in black. Not all the original parts. So I see. Handlebars. Lever. That is cool. What about the cylinder heads? - Bidalo? - Yup, my son's idea. Excellent. It can misfire at low revs. - All right. - But crank it up and... it goes like a rocket, for sure. Sublime. I will get on, just to check the height. Sorry ... You can let go. Don't worry. Okay? Sure, don't worry. Just great. It is the perfect size for me. - Fuel? - Sure, must be some in there. Fantastic. No issues here either. The axles? We agreed on 3,000, right? In any case, I will try it out. My father told me, do not buy it without trying it. Look, you can ride behind me, to the corner and back. That way you see how she handles. No, that will not work. I need to try the shift, check it is good and smooth. The clutch likewise feels a bit stiff. Here, you keep my bag. - With your ID? - Everything. Take care of it. There is my phone, my keys... I will just go there and back. - To the corner? - Sure. Watch out, it takes off. It is lively. Sure, an 85. That is right. - It is kind of jams there. - Slightly. You want me to give it a quick... Great smell? Just to the corner and back. - No worries. - Careful. She's lively. No problem. I was born with a bike between my legs. I bet. Watch out, though. - What? - Can I bum some gas? - 20 to fill her up. - C'mon, I am out. Move your begging ass. I am no gas pump. Tightwad! Is this premix? Yeah, it is premix. Why? I need some. - Give me that, please. - I need it. Be cool. - I am flat out. - Yeah, me too. Give me that. You rock up and help yourself? I asked. You said, "It is premix? I will have some." Can I take some? I do not have enough. Let us go 50-50. - I would if I could. - Do not hog it. I want to burn it up. Watch them burn it up, I am the only lameass stuck here. Go on... A smile for some fuel. Creepy, dude. C'mon, just a smile. Call that a smile? You are busting my balls. So come on. Not either. There you go. Just one liter. Your buddies can't spot you fuel? - You saw me with anyone? - Nope. Well then. You come to the ride solo? I don't need anyone here. You're wack. It's not about "need." Don't come solo. Here, on my own, I get ripped off. Who's gonna rip me off? No one. - Leave some. - It is cool. Cool? We said a liter. You are out of your mind. Whoa, that wasn't one liter. What are you doing on the ride? You are dangerous. You got a death wish? Go riding someplace else. I am in no one's way. Accelerate! Ride or go sit with the chicks, and wait your turn. Ben, give her a break. You were a fish once. Move it! - What's up? - Hey. - On your own? - Yeah. Come with me. I will show you a trick. And the bike goes up, get it? Throttle out, boom. 2, 3, up it goes. 2, 3, too high? Brake. Take it easy, no need to go for miles. Chill. Second, third, hit the 12. Brake. It is a pain at first, wigs you out. Once, twice... You are going to crack, bro. Even I cracked! It makes you crack, dude. But cool. Just think, see, 2, 3... And you be dialed in. Like these dudes. Straight up, 2, 3. Keep thinking it. Can't do it? Feet on the ground. 2, 3... - Try again, and so on. - Throttle, brake. - Throttle, brake... - You got it. Exactly. Do it, you will see. Hitting the 12's hard, then you get it down. Hit that 12 and you will get braking down. Get the brake down, you are good to go. Look at me now. I was struggling like you. Salty like you, bro. I was like, bring it on, symphony time. No! Life would be so cool. Smooth. Good and smooth, second, third. Until you get it. When you got it, you are going to fly, dude. You will see it is a sick world! - Imma burn it up. - You bet, bro. It is all I want see. Someone flies! See you the other side of the line. - The cops! - Pigs are coming! Get out there! - Po-po's on the way! - Move! - Get going! - Cops are coming! - The cops! - Dip, guys. Cops are coming! - Who ate it? - Abra got hit. Abra! What is going on? Don't hang around. Get out there! Give him air. Move! - Lift him up! - Don't touch him, you dummy! Don't lift him up, I said! Go easy. He'll make it. Okay, Abra? Come on, get him up. Take it easy. Get him some water. - Take your time. - You okay, dude? - Abra, you okay? - What happened? - Guys, his ear's bleeding. - It's nothing. - It is serious. Get him. - No way past the pigs. - Take him back. - It's serious! - Where is Manel? - Manel! There he is! Dude, you okay? Put his leg flat, will you? His face is messed up. Get the bikes! Tell me I have all my teeth. - It is shock, it is normal. - I can't feel them. You swallowed your tongue. You are in shock. - Tell her to go fuck herself! - Look at his legs! Gimme your shirt, your shirt! I don't need anyone's help. You want touch my dick or what? - I has got to stop the bleeding. - Get off of me! I do not need any help! The pigs are coming. C'mon, let me get up. On my own, bro. Go fuck yourself! Fat whore! Skank! What is that fat whore doing here? Nobody touches me like that. Nobody! Who the fuck is she? Where is your bike? I cannot see it. Ride solo, shit happens. Come on. Move it. She is with us. Get in. Let us bounce! Ben, drive! Let us go! Po-po on the bridge. Take next left. Hang left. You, mixed chick! What is your name? I go by Unknown. FYI, leave your bike unwatched, with the vultures out there, you are fucked. Next time, no truck. Get yourself home. What do you guys do here? I get it. You fix up bikes, switch numbers? It is Ben. He buys up bikes on the cheap. We find parts here and there, rebuild and sell them on. Right, hookah time. A warning. Anything disappears, I know it is you. I am down with this here. I see you pulling that shit, weasel-face. What are you doing? You grab my quad... - Knock it off. - I grab a photo. You let her get on your quad? Swear to God, that's a banging photo. Looks like an Amazon. - She will fuck shit up. - Share it. - Get it? - Yeah, I get it. Back there, she is like crazy, to save Abra. When I saw Manel's legs, I freaked. She is like, does not touch him. You think only you freaked? She was right in there, like don't touch. You can see she is used to it. - She is a scavenger. - Ben is right. I am seeing a woman. - You are seeing a woman? - Bro... A person with long hair, breasts, that's a woman. Not a tranny! You spiced that up? He hangs around, hoping to toke. Does not get it. Careful, watch where you're going. Let him hope. - It is Ophélie, guys. - What? Kaïs... Hey. Hey, Ophélie. Kylian, what up? All good, Clark? Guys... What is wrong? What is going on? I cannot tell them. I cannot. Abra reached the hospital in a bad way. He is in a coma. How come? You rode with him. In a coma? - What? - You are talking shit. And Manel? Stitches in his leg. He will be out soon. Clark, what happened in the truck? He was fine, talking, nothing wrong. They said it was internal bleeding. Internal bleeding? They did an MRI scan. Yo, how are you doing? Answer at least. Show respect. Hi, anyone home? Look who is back here. - Come over here. - Look... Julia, where is your bike? She is hoofing it, guys. You got a nerve, coming back here. Shut it. It's my hood. Go home to mommy, dude. What the hell? You changed the lock? If Mum sees you, she will call the cops. Stuff goes too fast here. I know she is out. You are covered in blood. Fighting again? It is not mine. You did not go to work. Your boss called. You really are a fool. Julia... Why would you shout out? Why would you shout? Open the window. Stench of fuel gives me a headache. What is with the outfit? Mum's duds? - You are wack. - Where are you going? What? - Where are you going? - Class. Where else? Hold on... - 50 bucks. Call up about the bike. - No way. - Call. - I am not doing your shit. Here. - 50 bucks. - I would help you for 50 bucks? - 100? - 200, and you scoot. - You are just a little whore. - 200, and we are done, through. Go on the streets, good riddance. I am not staying in this decrepit dump. Here! You got mad lip, it is insane. - This here? - What where? - The 125? - Yes. - Talk nice. - Like I talk any other way? Good morning, sir, I am calling about the 125-CR from 2007. That is right. Is it possible to see it today or... Or in the next hour? No, for my daughter. Hold on, please. Back off. Okay, have a wonderful day. Bye. Where? 25, Rue des Rosiers in Caudéran. - Where is Caudéran? - Dunno. Look on your phone. Get to class, you little whore. Is Kaïs here? What is the deal with Abra? They unplugged him. I wrote something. I would like to read... "Don't know why I got my phone out, "but I think I need to tell you, "on behalf of the B-Mores... "It hurts. "It hurts 'cause we laughed, bro. Laughs that felt like love. "Now the hurt feels like hate. "I am scared burying you one by one will blacken my heart. "I am scared I'll stop laughing so I will not get attached. "With you, I... I do not feel good. What? I do not feel good. What are you doing? Quit saying you picked me up when you didn't. Bro, you were bleeding. If I hadn't helped... I do not need anyone. - Definitely not a weird old chick. - Weird? - Beat it, fool! - I belong here. You... Please, guys. Kylian, stop laughing. Pull that shit and you will see. Get lost, ugly. You grub for friends where you do not belong. Please! Dirty tramp, swiping a free meal. You do not care? What did I say? Put your legs down. - You do not tell me what to do. - I do not? That is not nice. I do not care, not looking at you. Kylian, listen... Last warning... Yeah, Domino. Yeah, we got the money, thanks. It is quiet. I will switch to video. We are going to the ride. - Unknown is 125, she just picked up. - Cool little baby. That is mine. - Here is Unknown. - What you doing, bro? Move it. - Hold on... - Go easy. I will call you back. Learn some manners. - I have got manners. - Don't. If you roll with us, he needs to see you. - Who is he? - Domino. Who is Domino? He is the owner of the garage. B-Mores' top dog. Our "boss" if you like. When we fix up and sell a bike, we send him his cut. Why didn't you say so? Would Domino let me sleep in the garage? You got no crib? I cannot let you crash at the garage. How come? We have got all our bikes and gear there. I do not know you. If you do not trust me, lock me in with the bikes. - I am a fucking ghost. - No way. Anything disappears, how do I find you? I cannot do it. Anything goes down, I catch shit. Put your bike there. Not the bed, please. Sleep on the couch. That is Abra's bed. I thought you did not smoke. From time to time. Easy. You will be blazed. What is the tattoo? Beautiful. What is it mean? That is my business. You okay? Go. I want to get to bed. Kill the lights, do not go out. It is our hideout. What are you doing? In Abra's bed? What are you doing? Are you out your mind or what? Don't bust my balls so early. Bust your balls? A dead man's bed! You beg me to let you sleep here. I say, on the couch. I lock you in against the rules, and you, your bike, are in a dead man's bed. I am alive. You are alive? That's how you talk? Look, get dressed, and come talk with Domino. - What does he want? - Cut a deal with you. Accept and you sleep here. Say yes, for your own good. And clean this shit up. Everything. The bed, the bike. Leave no traces. Come on. There you go. Talk on video. Yeah? You are the kid punking rich guys' bikes? I just find them. I have got an offer for you if you want to sleep at the garage. A 450 YZF, the guy just posted it. Bring it in for me? - Where is it? - Left bank. Go with Kaïs in Ben's truck and bring it back for me. - Sure. - Let us see what you are wearing. - Hold on. - See? Back on your face. Film it right. Not bad. Seriously, she cuts it. - Yeah, I found her. - Threads are a disaster though. My wife will give you a makeover. Clean you up. The bike will turn around fast. I have a buyer. I will message the seller. When I have an appointment, I will be in touch. - Here. - Keep it, it's yours. - Mine? How come? - From Domino. Like I said yes, so I sleep here now? Yeah. Just okay? You are not pleased? Sure, I am pleased. Domino runs the show from the clink? Yeah. After his transfer here from Fresnes. What is he in jail for? Dunno. Lots, apparently. I am not too interested. Hi, Ophélie. You good? - Kylian! - Kaïs! Hey there, buddy. Your buddy is unbearable! He cannot sit still. No, he is cool. What did the man say? How do we dress her? Something with style. - Makes me laugh. I am no clothes store. - Domino called us last-minute. Almost everything is boxed up. What can I find her? - It is not when you want. - He told us last-minute. - On a bike? - Yeah. - So no dresses? - No. No skirts either? Too bad. Counts this out. Here... Try these maybe. Go on. Looks good. Shows you off, shows off your figure. There you go. That's good. Suits you. With your hair up like this... It is pretty. Why the long face? I look like a car saleswoman. What do car saleswomen look like? It is pretty, looks good on you. I am not hungry. You are going to eat even if you are not hungry. Damn thing burns every time. Cold inside and burned outside, dammit. Eating cordon bleu makes you super strong. Do not care! He is a real pain. And the groceries without Abra? What did Domino say? Not a word. With my mom, it is tricky. I cannot do it. Shit! I cannot leave here, so... I did not say it was on you. I will talk to him. He says he will call and doesn't... If you want, I will do it. Really? You can? Yeah. What do I have to do? He sends a list every week. Buy the food, bring it here. Done. There you go. Look... Here... Yan will give you the rest. That covers the week. Put your wad away or I will take it. No cash to be seen here. - Kylian, you do not like it? - He is a picky eater. It is hell. - I just love cordon bleus. - With cheese and all. Kylian, stop that. Knock it off now! What was that? You are shitting me! Eat now! Pick up your fork and eat! I cleaned the carpet. There is food everywhere, little clumps! Let us bounce. Eat up now! We are going. - So long. - See you. - Talk later. - Yeah. See you. Move it! Gimme the bag. - I will be waiting. Be careful. - Sure. - Emile. Nice to meet you. - Lucie. Hi, I am Mathieu. So this is the beast? - Like it? - Totally popping. A few dents on the fairing. Nothing major. And the exhaust? I put an Akra on it. Brand new. - Why? - I did not like the original. You ride or... - What do you think? - I do not know. For sure. - Are you guys taking the rise? - No! - Cool, right? - Yeah. Maybe a touch high. It is a four-fifty. I am used to it. - Riding four-fifty's? - Yeah. Yesterday, I was on a 450 CRF. Want me to show you? - Show me what? - I ride it around, you watch. So you know, no try, no buy. No tricks, right? We drove 40 clicks over here. No tricks but I gotta feel it. - Ride behind me. - I need to work the shift, the brake. Only natural, right? You buy a bike without trying it? Where are you going? Not far. There and back. - There, no farther. - First, second, to there. Just there, then you stop. Hold onto my bag. My house is open. My keys are inside. - Don't go to the road, will you? - Sure. You scared or what? Not scared. It is for you. It's all good. - Want me to start it? - No need. Easy does it. Hold on! Getting changed here? Keep your eyes on the road and off me. We are there in 10 minutes maybe. How come? All good, it is in the back. I cannot go any faster. Yeah, right away. We got to move it. Shit, this is my hood. At the roundabout, take a left. GPS says different. I will show you something. We are in a hurry. You got a 450 back there? Trust me. Turn off there. Right? I would follow you anywhere. Lose the smile, fool. Drive! Straight ahead. All right, stop. Check out the blue truck. Been tracking that baby for months. Straight up, it is full of bikes. Go on, drive! What is your plan? Hit the dealership? The dealership? You're nuts. With dogs and cameras, no chance. No, way simpler. We wait till it is dark, follow it and... We bust open the back and ride off on the bikes. You are out of your mind. I am serious. I know you are. You are hungry. I dream of hitting it. Hit that truck there, you got my respect for life. It is like a Brinks. Unbelievable, right? It is one hell of a plan! To the side. Back up. Keep it straight. Shit! One heck of a bike! 450 YZF! That is what we want. Start her up. Give it gas! Sweet sounds! Akra pipes, yo! How would you bag it? It was not me. I took nothing. That is the baby! - What you doing? - It is a stolen bike? The goose that lays golden eggs. She brings in the bikes. - 450 YZF! - It was her? - You bag bikes like that? - Golden eggs? Crazy mug she got! She has got that psycho look on her! Yeah, fucking psycho! Go home. You do not belong here. Badass bike! Act big, you will see. - Acts big, your girl. - Cool it. - A real scumsucker. - Big fool. - Polish your bike. - You dopes. Yo, Ben? - Yeah? What's up? - Over here. You got the serial numbers? For tonight, doable? I do not do that. I get the bikes, I loan my truck. I am on serial numbers? Grab a bike with Mous and do the numbers. What is your problem? - You do it. - It is ready tonight. Domino wants it clean tomorrow. No sweat, but I only got numbers... That is the deal, do not argue. Just do the numbers. Noobie is on fire. Rides good? Ask her. She rode it. Sold tomorrow. Back up. Back up, I said. - Blew you out, like a birthday candle. - Can it. Dude gets mad. Spitting mad. Bunch of bootlickers. Look at me like that, I will slap you up. Cool it. Chill! Do the frame, I will do the numbers. Bike life is not stealing. You are all nuts. Bro, Domino told her to get it. - So what? - So tell Domino, not her. - No stolen bikes. - You guys are wack. Bro, that bike earns us 6k. - Like I give a shit. - You do not give a shit, right. We are family. United. - Forget it. - We are united, all together. - There is your share, everyone's share. - I want none of it. You want none of it? I will not even touch it. You are okay swiping pistons, but not a bike? Someone swipes your quad, whaddya do? I will steal till I can buy another. You got it easy. Two endorsements, you buy the 2021. I ride a 2008 beat-up motherfucker, like a raggedy... Do the same as me. Just the same. I am not as good as you. You saw it, you know it. - So practice. - Practice, how? I have got to work. What can he do with drum brakes? No shit. No kidding, bro wants a new quad. Motherfucker! Meantime, the bike is here. Here... This is for you. Take Domino's groceries out of it. Okay? No, that's mine. That is yours. Enjoy! What will you do with the bike cash? Dunno. I steal all I got... I do not need money. I want outta here. I have had it. And go where? Far away. With my mum. She has not travelled much. You are from the Caribbean? Can't you tell? Guadeloupe. Why are you not eating? I am not hungry, no appetite. How come? Dunno. I'm thinking. Thinking about what? About you. Hi there. What is that on your face? Let me disinfect it. Here. Let me... Deep breaths, calm down. They are marks from blows. You did not get those on a bike. I will cut him up. He will not see me coming to kick his ass. Fucking son of a bitch! I will cut the motherfucker. So far you got cut, kid. I know who did this to me. I do not want to know. Then I catch the shit. What about the stuff for my hair? No, it was not on the list. I do not fucking believe it! The fucking jerk! I ask for one thing. Anything he wants, he never forgets. Definitely not. What is that for? It is for him. The clink is not wise to all that coming in? He pays off the guards. It goes straight to his cell. Money buys you everything. Snap it in half, you will see. My gift. It is yours. See something? Shit, it is the guy from prison. Do not let him see you. Go in the living room. The living room, I said. Evening. - Here you are. - Thanks. Your husband asks why you did not come to visit. What do you mean? I did. He says no. Not with the boy. Going on four days. Look, we talk every night on the phone. If he has anything to say, we do not need you. I think I will manage. - Thank you, guard. - Goodnight. Just do your dumb job, dude. Your teeth, I will bust them up. Your shitty mouth! Why is the screen dark? What is wrong? I broke my phone. You are shitting me. What is your game? That is your finger on the camera. The YZF's sold. Demand is high. We have got to get busy. For when? Keep on the alert. I found a recent model, a 450 CRF. What is with your eye? I did it earlier on my bike. I did that and my knee. Let me see your knee. Come on, let me see your knee. You are sure you can ride a bike? Dunno. It hurts like hell. You are telling me it is screwed. Just say so, end of story. For sure, I can ride a bike. You are sure of that? Yes. We got work to do. Orders are flooding in. No stopping now, we milk it. Your system works. We change nothing, keep going. Okay, got it. Death. The more you think about it, the less you kiss the asphalt. Throttle, brake. Blaze away. Straighten it up. Let us go. What took you so long? I am not taking a dead man's place. What you doing? We have got to blow. You are not in good shape. You okay? What is going on? Take it easy. What is wrong? C'mon, we have got to go. Hold on, easy does it. Look at me. You can trust me, you know. Check that out. Come on, lift it. That is good. Now, carry him. The witch! Witch! Remember that blue truck in my hood? With the bikes, sure. Dunno, who is this, but is he mad? Look at that. Those guys are artists. Swear to God, I want to do that job with you. I cannot get it out my head. - Doesn't the vid look dangerous? - Dangerous? Balance, speed, we got it all. We can ride together, right? What is in there? KXF 2022's. No? You know how to talk to a guy. You come up with jobs like that? For real? Cool. Count me in. We are going to be so good. Then we dip, straight up. I am taking you with me. Manel! Dial it down or you eat a piston tonight bitch Eat your fucking piss! Imma cut you! Imma cut you. Look at me! This blade is going in your teeth. Admit it was you who beat me up. You crazy, I never touched you! - Where is your phone? - What about my phone? Where is your phone? Guys! She is going to shiv me! - She will shiv me! - Quit whining, bitch! Pick her up! Why duck me after I helped you? Get the hell outta here! She swiped my phone. Cut this out now. Come here. Come here! Quit thrashing around! Calm down! Sit down! See that table? Bang your head on it, you will bust it open. All right? Put all this in the bedroom. I' am sick of stuff everywhere, under my feet! I need my space too. Look at this! The table! Where do I sit now? Do I put it in my room? Where else? I got your hair gloop. Thanks. No, leave that. We are not picking up after him. He has messed the place up all morning. I cleared everything away three times! Little prick! Come here. The little prick hits me. You guys never go out? Sure, sometimes, but not always. How come? Every time I come, it is dark and you are barricaded in. There is a main road. You want him to get squished? I will open up when Domino's out. I cannot run after him all day. I want to come for a ride? Where are your shoes? Are you crazy or something? It will calm him down. Domino doesn't like us going out. He is weird. Let us go see it. He has not got any shoes on. It is cool. I carried him. Here, put this on, Kylian. Lean forward, like you are riding fast. Throttle it. Brake check. Carve it up! Come on, that is enough. He is seen the bike. - He is having a blast. - No, come on. - Let us go, Kylian. - He does not want to. Enough now. You have seen the bike. - He does not want to. - Cut it out, please. We start up, a quick ride and we head back. No, I do not like bikes. Liar! I know you want to. Look, it starts. - Scared? - No. Hold on tight. Kylian, hold on! You're going to love it. What is it? A scrapyard? It is not a scrapyard. Awesome. Look at the roof, Kylian. The holes. No kidding, there has glass everywhere. It is all broken up. It is an old boatyard. Beautiful, isn't it? Yeah. It is blue on the ground! That is beautiful. It looks burned. Watch out, Kylian. I cannot... Wait for me. Go on, I am holding on. It is a huge storm! Careful of the thorns. See the bridge? Yeah, the bridge! It is impressive, seen from here. Look at that. You cannot see much, short stuff. It is beautiful in the sunlight. I can see boats! And there is a big crane next door. You can see everything. - There is a big crane. - It is a big crane. Mind the brambles. I do not like brambles. Last summer I went to Corsica. - Yeah? - I have family there. My parents. He freaked out on me. Who do you mean? Domino? Why would he freak out on you? He hates us missing visits. All on his own, he broods. That is why he will not give me a cent. For fear I will go back. Shit, felt like I got a real buzz on your bike. I was kinda nervous. You are kidding. That is not fear. It is adrenaline. It is natural. I am shaking too. It is lit. That is a bike thing too, right? Yeah. That is a piston. There are upper and lower parts of the engine. In fact, it goes up and down, up and down, up... and down. Without that, my bike will not work. Its heart. Yeah, exactly. What is that in your hair? It is the mask you got me. Fuck, stuff's greasy. I will be going. You are leaving? You have got to call him, right? I do not feel like it. I told him Kylian was sick. Yeah but I have got stuff on the go. Thanks. Later. - What you doing here? - And you, at Ophélie's? Nothing. - You spying on me? - No. What is with ghosting me? Here I am. You blank all my calls. I was busy. So you are following me. Not a bit. I called Domino about your plan. He is down but he agrees we need the others. Sure but Manel will not play ball. Manel's the best. We need him. And I will talk to him. It will work out. Work out? You saw what I did to him. He wants you to get him a WRF. Pain in the ass. He sounded weird, like you spooked him. I spooked him? I think so. Here, your new toy. A WRF. Yo, that is classy. The fairings need changing. They are all bust up. - That is no big deal. - I tightened the foot pegs. No other issues? No, it is a smooth ride. Repainted, too! It is plated at the back. Square, that is better. Why you want a clunker? Look what you ride. It is not for me. It is for my kid sister. Your sister rides? She fools around for fun. We are good? No more tantrums? Straight up, you killed it. Maybe take a look at the forks, check all is good there. Yeah, Domino. We are at the garage. How you doing, Unknown? All good for the truck job? Yeah, we tried with the bikes. It does not work. We need quads. Go with Mous's Raptor and Yan's Banshee. And do not forget the Kawa invoices. - I am on the paperwork. - Good job. And no more rides with my wife. Stop that. Creepy. Here. We will do your heist. Domino told me about it. It's nuts. We will do it. It will be magnificent. You are here? I have something for you. No, this cannot happen. You cannot be here. Go. Please, go now. - How come? - We are running late for our visit. Buckle up, Kylian. He does not want you here. Not for groceries or anything. Put your seatbelt on. I want to see Julia. No, buckle up. We are leaving. Please, Julia. You cannot stay here. How are you, pebble? I want to stay with Julia. Do not worry. I have stuff to do, then the three of us go away. What are you talking about? You are on another planet. It is nuts. Come on, that is enough! Get in the car. Buckle up. Do not ever come back, Julia. Go, go, go. Fucking headcase. Okay, we are good. How about it? Ready to attack the stagecoach? - What up, Manel? - Hey. - Watch out, skin showing. - Good to go? Yeah, we are good to go. - Where is your helmet? - Here, do not worry. I got it. We worked on the tire pressure, warmed them up. We are on it. They are ready to ride. Guys, we up for this? Ben, helmet. Let us go. What is going on? You stressing? Paperwork better be in the truck. It will be. I go in first. - How come? - Because I do. I grab all the paperwork. Dial it down or you eat a piston tonight. Where's the paperwork? Stuffed in your pussy? You got a pussy? Imma check! Fuck! Ben! What the fuck you doing, Ben? You will get us all busted! Where are they, bro? Gimme the bike. I'll go get 'em. Mommy! - What? - Here... What is this? For Khalilou, Facene MMG, and all asphalt pirates. For my grandmother.
