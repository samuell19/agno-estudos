Now I'll have some rest to write my memoirs, finally. You'll be the first readers for sure. Come on. Down. Be still! Captain! The crew is waiting only for you. Come back with something splendid! Most importantly, don't get shipwrecked, Mr. Robinson! Do not worry, sirs, and see you soon. Bud! Hurry! Let's go! And write to us! Your bed, Bud. The shackles will drive me crazy!! Is it possible remember things in such noise?! If there is some tale of simple man about his adventures in the world... ...worth of public familiarity, then the author of this memoir thinks that he's telling such tale. Come here! My mother is from the City of York, an old and respected family. My father was a very learned man, and gave me a good education. I attended a local school and studied at home. I wanted to be a sailor. I often dreamed of the southern seas and long voyages, my thoughts yearned for adventure. One morning, my father called me to his room and had a serious conversation with me. Dear son, why does your hot blood draw you away from home? The only place where you can achieve happiness, contentment and prosperity. But know that I will not aid you, if you make up your mind on this stupid move. If you go, you'll be the most unhappy of men. I did not pay attention to the advice of my father and followed the advice of a friend, who went to London, and September 1, 1651, I sailed from my home City. Shortly after leaving, I learned what a mistake it was to leave the cosy home of my father. With the last bit of our strength, we got to the shore, and there the captain said: Young man, I can give you some advice - never go out to sea. Since you already almost died when we didn't even pull up the anchor. Good luck in the world! Where does this fool send the ship? My Lord, where are we sailing? Where do you steer us? It is in the other direction! Bud, put back the inkwell! And hold it tight! Rescued after shipwreck I found myself on the beach near Winterton. I could have returned to my father's house, but I only had a little money, so I decided to go to London on foot. In London, I walked into a good company, and got acquainted with a captain. After some time the captain realized that my adventurous nature suited his purposes. And asked me to accompany him in his business travel. to Guinea. Thanks to my friend Captain's honesty, I brought back 5 pounds and 9 ounces of gold dust. I also studied seamanship, learned all there is to the seafarer. The importance of reinvesting profits thus continuing the trading business. Alas, my friend died soon after his return. And I vowed to sail out on the same boat again. During the trip, we had a terrible accident. Around the Canary Islands a Turkish corsair of Saleh attacked us. We had no choice but to prepare for battle. Our ship had 12 guns, while the pirate ship had 18. When the enemy came on board 60 pirates jumped on the ship. We fought back with muskets and cutlasses, and twice we pushed the pirates back. But the superiority of the enemy was too great, and we could not resist. We were taken as prisoners to the Moorish port of Saleh. They treated us well, much better than I had expected. Since I was a young man, the Captain chose me and made me his slave. He took me to his house and left me under his wife's care. Thus ended the journey on which i had placed such high hopes. But I have not lost hope that one day my lord would take me with him to the sea. When he left for the sea, he left me at home, where I had to work on the farm. and as a servant to fulfil the usual whims of housewives. Yeah, but... Those were hard times. Slave labour in the house of the Corsair inspired me to think about escaping. One day, after two years of slavery, The opportunity presented itself to me. My boss decided to go at sea for fishing, and in hope of a successful trip, he brought me and the boy-servant Xury along. I realized that I have a chance to fulfil my dream now. And I was ready to do whatever it takes, not to miss out on this chance. It was a difficult decision, but I felt my fate was sealed at that moment. Life or death, I said to myself. I took a moment and pushed him overboard. Taking the gun, I took aim at the Moor, and said, if you come close to the ship, I will shoot you. After these words, he swam to shore, and I'm sure he swam without a problem, because he was an excellent swimmer. Sir! Sir! There's a sail-boat! Xury was worried that the Moor was after us. But I noticed that the ship sailed under different flags. My happiness was endless, realizing that I could so easily get out of the mess. I gave the captain everything I had, as a sign of gratitude. Out of Christian love, he bought the boat from me, and everything on it. He promised to free 10 years old Xury if he would become a Christian. For my property the captain gave me 200 gold pieces. He took me to Brazil where I bought as much land as I could from my money. However, I quickly realized that I chose a job that was uninteresting and unfamiliar to me. I had to work very hard. I have often talked to neighbours, who just got rid of the useless Xury, and they said that in Guinea one cannot only just trade trinkets for gold dust, but many slaves to work on the fields, as well. My neighbours were also in need of labour force, and offered to organize an expedition to Guinea. We've decided that I'm going on the expedition, and in return will receive an equivalent share without my initial investment in this business. And they promised to take care of my household in the meantime, too. So, September 1, 1659, exactly eight years after I ran away from my parents, I went up to the deck of the ship. I and my companions have equipped the ship with all necessary. Besides chains for slaves, were still objects to exchange trading on the African coast. It's toys, jewellery, mirrors, glass, knives, scissors, different trinkets and other things. Bad... Leave me alone.. Phew! Go away! Oh, what was that? Oh! That's breakfast!.. Is it Bad... Our ship! Bad! I'm coming for you! Bad, my faithful loyal friend! How are you here? The only living creature who survived a shipwreck, was my loyal friend, dog Bud. My eyes filled with tears at the thought that if we stayed on the ship, everything would have survived. But the tears of sorrow will not help, and I was saved from the ship I needed things. So, in the first days after his rescue, I was 12 at the time the ship wreckage, and took out anything that can raise a couple of human hands. I got probably the largest store of things that can save one person. Then I started to stock arms so that I can protect themselves from savages and wild beasts, if they are of course there is. Life has taught me that extra caution never hurts. And even in this empty place, I was prepared for any eventuality. And despite the hard times, I did not forget to write your memoirs, which, thanks to my fate, are even more astonishing. Lord! What happened?.. Where we are drawn! Escape for what you can. Help! Bad! Well, Bud, do something! That's all... In the place where I was thrown sea, a large wooden cross, I cut out the date on it to save himself. and began to lead him to the calendar to consider how many days have passed, months, years... Bad! Bad! Bad! Keep track! I hasten to you! Let me go! Calm down, that's it. What! It can not be!.. This is a bad dream. You also see this? Woe! We are on the island... The news that we are on the island, I was very upset. But a little thought, I came up with the idea - to build a canoe. Just as it is done by the indigenous inhabitants of the islands. From the trunks of trees, with no special tools and quickly. Well, I thought, it is easy to carry. I comforted myself with the idea of??a speedy deliverance. A hole in the boat? This is not good. One-two-three-four-five-six... Bad! You're crazy, is it so get in the boat! Get out of here! Now correctly. This will be enough. Goodbye to the island! These two years have been for me too long. We sail, and will soon be home-and-a... Leave the island failed. From heavy rains, I get wet and sick. And since my illness... And since my illness I was not allowed to write my memoirs, decided to keep a diary. June 21, I felt very bad. I thought of death was introduced into the gloom. June 22, I felt a little better. But still feared that even more sick. June 23, again I felt bad, shivering and scared headache. June 27, much easier! June 29, again shivering I asked God why He allowed this to happen to me trouble. And as if he had heard his voice: -Villain! You've done so much!.. Look at your rotten life! Get up and look! No, you lie. Unfortunately... Unfortunately, I ran out of ink, and I can no longer write a diary, or memory. Bud, what did you bring me, you too hungry? Wait, there may be something left. Nothing... None of them. None of them. Oh, Bud, my faithful friend, it seems that we just have to go hungry. Oh, phew!... I understand that was not enough, only one tooth. We are saved. Bad! Fetch! Surprisingly, Bud, what a beautiful area! Come on, Bud! Let's go! Come on, try it. What is this? Bow!.. This vine!.. Here coconuts!... What delicious! Thank you, Brett! Get out! Just you wait! Here, take it, Bud. Do not you? What happened? O... Another mouth. Grab! You-Poly. I-Robinson. Correctly. Bud, and now you, introduce yourself. Excellent. And it's all ours. And what is grown? Wheat! Bread! We will make bread! How many ears of corn grown? One, two... ten. This is not enough for a piece of bread. Populated field! Bud, go, help me. Bud, help, help, help... Work, work, work!.. Spud... not that. Bad! Bad! Where this dog gone? Bad dear! Show yourself! Well Badyka, put more vim into it. So Badyka, Lie down comfortably. Bad! Wait, I'll be back. Robinson, Robinson! Come on, Bud is very bad. Too bad! Too bad! Bud, my friend! What happened to you? Well, lie down, rest, keep warm, and you'll feel better. Do you have pain? Hold on. And all will be well... You will be missed? Yes? Yes. Bad, calm down, that is, Vol. What happened? Again this mischief. Bad longer walk into the hole will not have to fill it. And here no longer fit. You see, Bud, we're here for 25 years. How time flies!.. For bake bread. But mostly in the old way. Robinson, Robinson, in the human footprints. What did you say?.. Quiet! I will monitor them. Oh, man!.. End of loneliness! Again, I will hear the human voice, again to see people's faces. What luck! Brothers! People! I welcome you! At your service! Go back! Why did you run away? I Robinson Crusoe, a sailor from York! I'm a person just like you! What a nightmare!.. Cannibals!.. What does he want from me? He thanks you for saving, and wants to be your servant. But he also eats people? He, too, here eat everything but only when the benefit. Robinson, can you let it, it will not be. Will be my servant. In memory of I saved your life on Friday, I give you the name, Friday. Friday, this sabre. Sub-la. Correctly. -And this grain. -Zer-but. Now, look. Got it? Now you try. -Grapes. Bu-but-deg. Friday knows. -Duck. Ym-ka. You see, Bud, now I had an assistant. Do you know his name? Friday. Most recently he was a cannibal. Sorry you can not see it. As you know, we have a lot to do. I teach him everything that I know... Oh, I almost forgot, he sends you greetings. Friday! How you got the idea to roast duck? And I wanted to fish. Let the gentleman is not angry, and comes with Friday fish, Friday can. Thank you. Where did you get that? One very good mistress left, this also. This gentleman left, he was not very tasty, and hard. Friday! This is a British order. I look like the governor of the island! Friday, we go to our residence. Sir, light. Friday, as time runs! Of my life were only memories. Sir, stop complaining, and you better try this, from this year's harvest. What a nice island! There and the pier. You know, Friday, and we're in paradise, You see, what a clear sky, a beautiful land, around the boundless sea, a ship is floating on it... Ship?.. I lose my mind!.. I swear on my life, it is a real ship! Friday, rather let the telescope! This is an English ship. A miracle! They found me. Already swim here. Friday, I meet them as governor of the island!.. Hurry up, so I had time to prepare. Friday, do so to me a better view. Sir, the British people will also have a captive? It seems like they want to kill those two, but there will not. I'm sure of it. Now they know I meet them here! -What do we do, sir? -Do not you have some cunning plan? Paulie! What? Do it! Hand me that bottle. Mess with them will not. Go around the island, see just not here no one lives. If the island is uninhabited, leave them here. And if anyone met, Then the two shoot, and be gone from here. If someone met, so kill him. And then run away. Said one of them. Friday something planned! Help! Help! -Did you hear? Wait, Bill. I'm going after him! Bravo! Help! Help! No, no! Go there! Help! Help! So, it's done. Fear not, friends. I am the governor of this island, we come to your aid. Do not believe it - it is God or man? This is either a man or an angel, I do not know... I'm a man, an Englishman. Who are you? I am the captain of this ship, and this - the navigator. The crew mutinied and dropped us off on your island. I will deliver you, if you follow my terms. Oh, Mr. Governor, we will fulfil any of your terms... Look out, captain! Please, sir! These are my conditions. It is only one. What is it? Take me and my man Friday, for free in England. At your service, Governor! Agree, Captain? Of course, but the rebels have left here. Mess with them will not... Sorry! I almost forgot. You will take my parrot and Poly. My ship is waiting for you. Goodbye, Bad, loyal friend, I will never forget you. Do not leave us! Go back! Go back! Good luck, Maintain order in the cave! Supply of food in your 3 days! And now here sail cannibals!.. And, Captain, I almost forgot, your ship has ink? You name it, Governor! Oh-oh-oh! Thank you! So, I left the island December 19, 1686, where he lived 28 years, 2 months and 19 days. Tired of London, I want to go back to the island! Get out of here, fools. I do not want you to know! I do not want here, I do not want, do not want... I want peace. After a long journey, I returned to England, June 11, 1687, which was absent for 35 years. Your tea, sir. Just like there. In England, I was a stranger to all, as if anyone did not know before. My father and mother died long ago. Of our family were alive two sisters. They thought I was dead and do not leave me out of the inheritance. They did not live in poverty, but not happy. One was a widow, another suffered a lot of rudeness from her husband. So I realized that there nothing good find. Old captain, who took me to Brazil, at first did not recognize me, but when I got dressed so was dressed as a prisoner of the Moors, He immediately remembered who I was. His son led a trade with Brazil and the captain promised, through it, to help me get my income holdings. From such a pleasant meeting I even dropped a tear. Brazilian ship, no problem brought my share, gold and commodities. There were 1,200 boxes of sugar, 800 bars of tobacco, 5,000 pounds of gold dust. I bought a big house in London, which quickly became the focus of the London public. I do not want anyone to see! A woman... Oh, my Robin!.. Dear!.. Get out of here! Sorry, sir does not want you to see... So I never shall add their memories... Friday, we go back to the island! We sail to the island! Hooray! Your tea, Governor. Just like there. No, milk is not necessary, ADD medication. -Which one? -Tu stronger drinks. Thank you. Would you like something sweet? I baked a delicious cake with cherries and cream. Is not it?.. Well, bring it. Oh, sweet cherries! While Mr. us see... And I saw it all! I saw it all! Thank you. Did not see anything! You know, my faithful friend, That's how I imagined my old age. Just the two of us and no we do not care. So we'll live through many fine days. I'm on it and I hope the governor.
