No, wait... Let me do it... Do you have aluminium foil? Like this. Go and get some aluminium foil. Like this! Align it with the pocket. Your mother told something about candles. Doina, you sit in the back and let Niki in front. There is no more space for this ones. I will hold them. Doina, you hold the bags. Niki, attach your belt. Could you help us to take downstairs these wreaths? Eugen! How many for the cemetery? Use as many rolls as candles. And also handkerchiefs. Is there plenty of candles? Yes Check the candles. Count them. God rest his soul! Have you seen my husband? The man operating the video camera. Mister Florian is downstairs. Come on, children, let's take Mihaita. Is the sermon over? Why didn't you tell me? Excuse me. Godmother! Where is the godmother? Look, they are taking Mihaita from me. Angela. Where is Angela? Come here. You are the only child that I got now. Be careful here. What are you doing? Put it now. Lift it. Put it now. Easy... Nail it. Let me do it. Give them to me. We need another table cloth. Bring me some medicine. I know where it is. In the evening when Mihaita returned from school he found it on his desk. Niki made the copy at the Academy. Delia, you don't know, but his father wanted him to study violin. I told him the boy wanted to learn to play the clarinet. Let him play clarinet. I told him the violin is for girls, clarinet is for boys. Then in the evening Mihaita came with "The Kitzer method" saying he had to return it to the library. And I told Niki to go and make some copies for the boy. In the morning Niki took the book and in the evening, when Mihaita returned from school he found the copies on his desk. Niki made the copies at the Academy. Irina, please bring the Kitzer method. How are you, in-law? Mihai, come and sit here close to me. Mihai... you have my son's name. Mihai, I burried my child... Niki, from Otopeni to Paris you flight 3 hours. The transit is 4 hours. Sorry, the transit is two hours. Paris - New York 11 hours. And to Detroit another 2 hours. 15 hours per total. In half a day, the children reach the destination. I don't understand what you can't understand. Mister Ardelean, wait a minute. Nothing is arranged yet. We don't know if we pass the interview or not. So until we leave there is still more time. Doina, Niki wants to tell you something. Niki, correct me if I am wrong. There are parents who think about the best for their children. And there are parents who want to have their children close. This does not mean that they are selfish. We should undrestand him. Eugen, but I told you before that I am not against it. I think there is no one there who could help you when you are in difficulty there We are here, far away This is what I think about. America is very far. And you don't even know what awaits you there. Don't get me wrong. Niki, from here to Satu Mare you need 12 hours by train If you return it is like you would come from America. Twice. Do you realize? I can understand Niki. He raised a child for 30 years. I mean two children. And when he is old, he has no one to fill his soda bottles. Niki, do what I do. Do you think I am not affected by this? Channel positively your negative energies. Eugen, we talked about this before. Mrs. Doina... Mr. Florian... Colonel Predescu told me this Mister Ardelean... Is he a relative with the administrator? No. He told me:"If the boy makes computer programming we need him. He has all the advantages. He does not need to enrol in the army to work for us. If he wants to enrol, we can accept him." You are a university graduate, you will be a lieutenant. And you can do your job. I don't know if you know, but the army was the first computerized institution from our country. Wait a minute... There are more important things than the job. Ok, you have your salary. The problem is what do you do with the money. For example you... you went twice to Sovata. Once to Amara and in the summer to Techirghiol. To Amara I went every year until '83. Ok. But think that in the USA you get on a plane and fly to Miami. Or to the Grand Canyon and the Lakes. Mister Florian, it is not about holidays. Mihai went on a tour with the Philarmonic of the Army he visited Prague, Budapest, Leningrad. He saw the world. Let's move in the other room. Papa, we need 3 more chairs. He was in Prague for a week. Two weeks in Leningrad. That is why I say. Mr. Florian, do you understand me? Niki, think only when they will be settled down there, They will invite us there for a month, 2 or 3 months. For how long can we stay there? Niki, how would be 6 months spent in America? This Colonel Predescu, could he go to the lakes? Daddy, it takes you less than a day to arrive to us. You should agree with papa: you come first, than you. Or papa and Doina come first and then you and mom. Angela dear, the priest did not arrive? Why did you get out of bed? I cannot lay down. Niki, come to the other room for dinner. Pusa, I would have what the priest is having. Me too, but without cucumbers. You should fast before Easter, regardless how tragic is the event that gathers us. But father, we fast all year round. This is not good, either. How come, Mr. Florian? Why do you fast all year round? There are days for fast when no meat is eaten. I am a vegetarian. We both are. And if you allow mw, I suggest that everybody should give up on Father, how is it with the vegetarians? Don't they fast? If you allow me a comparison, it would be as if when we fast we should eat meat. But as we don't eat meat, this means that we don't fast. Mister Tufaru, the fasting is not all about food it mean to refrain from sinful pleasures where meat has its place May God rest his soul! God rest his soul! Who wants more bread? What do you do, Mr. Tufaru? We need more wine. and bring also a bottle of mineral water. I am a freelancer. Florian makes martisoare. Not only martisoare, I also make cards for various events and with zodiac signs. Father, your sign is cancer. I was born on June 20th. Cancer. Do you know about signs, Mr. Florian? Florian is good at chirmonacy and tarot. How do the Taurus get along with Scorpio, Mr. Florian? You are a Scorpio? No, I am Taurus, my husband is Scorpio. This is strange. They don't get along well. After we took the soviet uniform model, we changed the braids with stars. Now we got back to braids again. And after retiring? After retiring - what? After a military retired, is he allowed to wear the uniform? Of course he can keep his uniform. Beasides, militaries do not retire. They become reservists. For example Niki. He is a reservist. And he is allowed to wear the uniform. But only on certain occasions. Miss Angela, I heard you go to America with your husband. Yes. Do you go there for good? We hope so. Do you let them leave so far away? In the case of general mobilisation we are required. Sorry, father, I did not hear what you asked. Do you let the children go so far away? If you cannot make a living here, close, you go where you can. Isn't this right, children? Father, we do not know for sure if we leave. We still have the interviews. We'll wait and see. Tell me, father, have you ever been abroad? You know how it is: until 1989 we couldn't, after that you become too old. Two years ago I was to the Germans. It's a different world. In the airport... the cleanliness... the cigarette machines... automatic doors... We also have automatic doors. We have, but they have them everywhere. A different world. And the prices which for us are huge, for them are small. With they salary you can buy here a Daewoo Tico. I was in Germany and it was not quite so clean... And the Germans are not so hospitable as we are. Where in Germany? In Dresden. That is east, sir. You know, this is not quite so easy for a father who lost his son to lose his daughter too. We believe that a parent's joy is to see the children accomplished. Isn't this so, Niki? Of course parents are happy to see their children settled down. I think that a father must stand by his children for good and Excuse me, Niki... Have more wine. ...for good and bad To be happy for them when they are happy and help them when necessary. When you are not near your child when he needs you, bad things can happen. And you find that you don't have the child anymore. Niki, you couldn't have helped him. Excuse me, officer, but we're not talking about that. Do you think he knows how to share himself between the son who died and the daughter who is to leave to America? I am wondering how was possible that a nice talented boy - because the truth is Mihaita was an artist - he was a talented musician. Colonel, it's not clear to me how happened this terrible fact. He wanted to change the fuse in the hall, his hands were wet and he was electrocuted. This is not about voltage: one could die at 220 voltage or at 60. It is about the amperage. But why his hand were wet? Father, I don't think you followed me. Did we say something wrong to Mr. Tufaru? He has no reason to be upset. On Saturday they bought a washing machine. I helped them bring it home. We installed it in the kitchen. We coupled it to the water tap. Then I went home. At 8:20 my daughter in law called me to tell me that Mihai was dead. The washing machine is powerful and the fuse went off. Mihai wanted to fix it. Ad because the porcelain isolation was broken, he touched the metal and got electrocuted. Look, father. Niki, I told you before, in America you won't see a fuse like this. Of course, this one is good because it was changed 2 days ago but on the other one, the ceramic shield was broken. the access to the conductor was free. This is why Mihaita got electrocuted. Not because his hand were wet. maybe someone wants caramel cream. Mother made caramel cream because Mihaita liked it. Yes, I want some. April 14 Please, give me 20 eggs. I have a bag. And egg paint. 2 packs of red paint, a green one and 2 packs of blue paint. Do you have vanillate sugar? Yes. 10 packs, please. How much is one? 500. Hello. Good morning, dear. This is for you. There are no more cookies. I want to ask you, how much do we have to pay for 2 persons? We'll have a look. 842,300... 850,000. How come? If now for 4 people we pay 580,000, why is more for 2? Wait... What did you ask? How much do I have to pay if we are only 2 persons? Oh, I understood if there are 2 more persons... We'll have a look at Oprea. 315,000. Yes... This is Angela's favourite song. I won't sell the computer. I will give it to my father. Why shouldn't we earn some money fpor it? And we will buy one from America. We need money now. Let's see then if we have enough money without it. Does your father give us the piano or no? No, he said we can sell the bedroom funriture, but not the piano. How much will one get for the piano? It depends. About $600. Let me see... $400 for the bedroom furniture, $500 which my father gives us, $300 already saved and $350 from Grafitti. If we add the piano we have $2350. We don't add the piano. He won't give it to us. How much then? $1,700. And add the computer. 2,400. 1,400 for the plane tickets, we are 1,000 left. I say it's good. What? No, if we have 2,400, we are ok. And don't shave like that. Look how it looks like. Why? It is more hygienic. Then shave every day. Look what you have done to me. This is not from me. What? Touch it and see how it stings. Shave daily or let it get longer. Then you too, shave daily. Look at you. Did you put sugar in mine? Do you know that doggy style is not indicated? What do you mean? Here you are. It's bad for the uterus. Could cause a miscarriage. The embrio can get loose. How much was the echography? It was free. At Biomedica it was 250,000. I think you are aware that $500 will be spend for the hopsital. At least 500. Bring some sponge cake. Go and get some. I have a bath. Yes? Angela, we go to the cemetery. OK. By 5 o'clock we'll be back. Please, take the sponge cake from the oven. Ok. I left you on the fridge the egg paint. Please paint them. The roast is in the fridge. Put it in the oven after you take out the cakes. Yes, papa. I let on the cabinet the lamb terrine to cool down. Hold on... Take care of the sponge cakes. Yes, papa. Yes, they left to the cemetery... yes... Papa, I told Eugen. I will pass him to you. An hour ago... yes, when we woke up... yes... Yes?...Some calculations... how long do you want us to stay there?

We can take lamb terrine (drob) and roast, radish, spring onions... Look, cheese and meatballs. No roast, because papa made some. We can take lamb terrine (drob). And 3 sponge cakes. How much said papa that we have to pay the doctor? 200. Including papers? No, 200 for the doctor and 100 for the papers. In this case we did not calculate well. If you take out 300 from 1,400 we won't have enough. When do we get the papers? On Tuesday. I woke up in the morning, went shopping... we have sponge cakes, roast eggs and wine. Do you think we can eat all? I wanted to celebrate Easter together. How do you go like this? And live us alone in the house... Don't you understand that I had no holiday for 2 years? I have some free days and I want to entertain myself. You mean you are not entertained with us? I get it... Thank you. LOok, mother, he is upset now. Why did you not tell me that you want us to be there? We could have told them we are not going. If you want, we can stay. We will unpack and stay here. We can go to the church. Nevermind, Angela. I will stay with your father. You go and have fun. Niki dear, let them go. The young with the young, the old with the old. But why Vama Veche? Why to the seaside? You could go to Snagov. Or to Caldarusani. There is a lake and a monastery too. Didn't I tell you that we will go to the church in Negru Voda? Ok, Angela. Do as you please. We can stay here, no problem. But think about your health, your baby... How can you bathe in the sea, in April? How could I bathe in the sea? There are only 15 degrees. Mom, did I tell you that I go to the seaside to bathe? Do you think I am crazy? I said we go to the seaside, not to sunbathe. Come on, Angela. Go. Pusa, but only the way to get there. Think about it... She is pregnant. Think about the fatigue. Niki, relax. I was pregnant with Mihaita and I followed you all over the country. Doina is waiting for us outside. Good evening, Florian. Good evening, Pusa. I have a bunny for you. Children, are you ready? Niki, I have for you the video tape from the wedding. Eugen, stay at home, We will watch this tape. Mr. Florian, bring Doina upstairs. We have lamb terrine, roast, eggs. We have seen it already. Niki, let them go. Bye! Happy Easter! Niki, allow me to shake your hand. Happy Easter. What we're going to do? Do we go to the sermon? Yes. We'll go here, close to the house. It is crowded. Double steps. A film by FLO want to have dinner? Yes. Did you pack drob, lamb roast and eggs for Angela? Angela and Eugen are a family now. They can take care of themselves now. Shall we eat in the dining room? June 11 Niki, do you know what mescaline is? Mescaline is a cactus. From this cactus is extracted the mescaline that makes you see the truth. You and people like you are the slaves of your habits. For who sees the truth, you are what I want to see you are. Each man lives with some conceptions that help him. If you see things like this, it is very good. I was told there is present, future and past. You will laugh, Niki. Not even the past exists. Let's say the present exists. I am drinking this coffee, I am holding the cup. I can feel it. It is. But where is the past? How can I touch the past? Moreover, how can I touch the future? As long as the present does not exist You must agree with me that the past neither exists nor the future. I contradict you here. You keep the memory of very precise things.I'll give you an example... Wait a little, Niki. What are you doing, engineer? I will tell you one more thing. Did you read Eminescu, do you know what he said? "Waves that rise can never hold" "You must think and ask of you" I think you should meditate about all these because they are related to our discussion. These? The shelves. OK. Tie them well. The sofa? We cannot disassemble it. I see... The tape recorder? Is taken. The table, the crystal? Did you disassemble the bedroom furniture? In two hours I am here with the people. What are you doing, engineer Eugen? Angela, what did you do to Eugen? Why is he so soft? Turn the monitor towards the wall... Hi Pusa, Hi Irina. Children, do you take something from here? No, papa. Pusa, do you still use this machine? If not, we can take it now and make more room in the house. Think about it and tell me. Niki, are you there? Yes. Do you think you finish in 2 hours? Of course we finish. In 2 hours I am back with Dacia. Mr. Ardelean, please help me to disassemble the wardrobe. Eugen, come to the wardrobe. I will do it. ou rest a while. Go and bring the screwdiver. Tell me what you wear from here. This for winter, pulovers... You won't take them with you. Leave them here. These stay, tose stay... Is this good? No, bring a bigger one. This one? yes. Mama, I put those here. Se what you can do with them. Irina, have a look, maybe you want something. Now take this big ones. Be careful... Watch the doorknob... Do you leave the table in the dining room like this? Eugen, take Mr. Colonel and go to disassemble that table. Niki, can I count on you? Be careful with the crystal. Careful, boys... Angela, go into the bathroom, take a cloth, get it wet and wipe the dust on the table. Do I really have to teach you everything? Easy... easy... LIke this... Go straight! Eugen, come here! Who disassembled this? It's from the desk. The colonel did it... Niki, come here, please! Let me show you something... Look here... First of all, never disassemble a desk with a hammer. I did not use a hammer. It you do it with a hammer, perviously wrap a cloth around the hammer. Look what you did to the melamine. It was like this since we bought it. Niki, look better. There are traces of hammer. Eugen! These two traces of mechanical pression were from the shop? Yes. Niki? Florian? Look what Irina gave to me. Don't tell me, Pusa, that you started to blow the clarinet. It belonged to Mihaita. It lacks the felt. Eugen! Come to take the computer! You take the monitor. I took the rest. Niki, be nice to the guys after they finish. I won't come back here. So you got it? After you finish, take Pusa, take the kids and come to us. Go and disassemble that table. Be careful with the crystal. Can I have two screens? If you use a video card... Yes? Flo. Can we sell the older one? No, I need it. You'd better kiss your son because they have the money for the tickets. Don't tell me! Did you sell the piano? Way to go! I go to help the colonel finish by dinner. You cannot imagine what a day we had. Go, arrange, get a car, carry the funriture... some stumblers! I stink, but I made it! Did you prepare something? We got champagne, salad, soy balls, pumpkin escalop yoghurt, leek with olives. I made a lot of things. And I laso bought cataif. I will take a shower. When I get out I want the table to be laid. Fuck your music! What happened, darling? Call the ambulance! What happened, dear? Shall I call the ambulance? Hello, my name is Doina Tufaru and my husband had an accident in the bath. July 4th We won't call at 4 am. Angela, we won't be sleeping. After you arrived, call us and tell that everything is ok. What time do you arrive at? At 9 PM. Very good. Call us. Well, 9 pm there means 4 am here. Have a sandwich! Angela, have some. Ham, cheese... Come on, Eugen. You don't know what they give you on the plane. Do you want, Angela? I cannot eat. Daddy, we cannot take off belly full. Eat, dear! Go and see Louvre by all means! We won't take off the plane. Eugen, pour me some coffee. But didn't you say you go to Paris? The plane stops 2 hours in Paris, but we don't get out the airport. Eugen, more coffee? No, thank you. I will pack the sandwiches for you. Niki, isn't this Florian's car? Yes, it is. Let's go. Mom! Come on! You have them with ham and with cheese. Papa is waiting for us downstairs. Take these sandwiches. Give me a break with your sandwiches! Mom, are you ready? Are they with cheese? And with ham. Go with Eugen and I will take the rest. Come on, mom! Put them here, there is space. I have a big trunk. Kiss you, Pusa. Niki, take your time. How does it feel like, engineer? When you go to America. Dad, help Eugen to arrange the luggage. I will hold this. Daddy's little angel... little angel Daddy's little girl... Be careful... And take care of the baby Good You take care... Take care of mom... My heart is broken when I have to say goodbye Let's go, Angela Be good. Come on, Niki. The plane is not like the train. Won't wait for us. Eugen, get in the back, near Pusa. In two hours' time we are back. August 23rd Niki! Hello, Mr. Florian. This is Ardelean speaking. Yes, I called to tell you that the day of August 23rd was made important by the army... It is not proven... Come, Mr. Florian. I have nothing against it. I will be waiting for you, Mr. Florian. Whenever you want. Niki, have a look. Was this a moth or I burned it while cooking? Is it cotton or synthetics? Synthetics. I don't talk bullshit. Where do you want to sit? In the living room. Hi, Pusa. I am happy that you watch this tape from time to time. This means you like it. It's nice. First of all, it is well done. Nicolae Baciu - The agony of Romania. Antonescu - The secrets of governing Borowitzka - Attempts meant to change the world Carlos Castaneda - Voyage to Ixtlan Nicolae Iorga - A man's life, as it was Eric Maria Remarque - All Quiet on the Western Front Bruno Wurtz - New Age It is easy to make affirmations if you don't consult literature. After you read more you start to see the shade of things. You have bookmarks, you go straight to the information. Mister Florian, there are facts. When the soviets consolidated their headquarters in Tighina, Von Killinger and Mihai Antonescu went to the king to discuss our withdraw from the war. Do you think it is not written here? Not Marshall Antonescu, Mihai Antonescu the foreign affairs minister. The Marshall was not then to the Palace. He went on Wednesday and they had him arrested. I know, Niki, I know... These are facts. We are talking about interpretations, about speculations. And from this perspective, I can surely affirm that not the army was at the origin of the events in August 23rd, 1944 and turning the weapons against the fascist. At the origin of the army insurrection were two civilians, Niki, like me. Prince Barbu Stirbey and Visoianu. Both these great Romanians were in fact sublime Scottish. Of course I speak foreign languages to you. Masons, Niki. This is why I brought you the books. One word, Niki, which covers all the historical events Freemasonry. Freemasonry? I don't get the contribusion of the freemasons to the events from '44. Excuse me, Niki. Pusa, have a look, quickly! Look how you danced with Niki. Pusa, what were you whispering into Niki's ear then? Allow me, and I finish. Here it is about logic. The army couldn't made the insurrection. The country was governed by the army that moment. The general - later marshall - Antonescu was your man. You governed the country and you were taking it progressively into the abyss. "Romanians, I command you to cross the Prut river" All the bad things came from here. It is true that Antonescu was the ruler of the country but those who arrested him on August 23rd were militaries. Sanatescu was a general. General Aldea, General Anton, colonel Damaceanu and Major Dumitrescu who arrested him. Why do you warm up? hy do you raise your voice? Do you want to have a civilized dialogue or I get up and leave? I was explaining, I did not raise my voice. If you want to discuss, let's do it, in a civilized manner. First consult the books I brought, reflect... ...call me and I come to discuss. Because I am open. Pusa, did you like the wine at the wedding? Do you know what wine was it? Cabernet. Cabernet of Murfatlar. Do you know where I gor it from? From Basarabi. Do you know why? Seed of peach in prune pulp. Of nine, begins with N. Maybe the N is not right. Where does it come from? From "plane tree".I found it: "nectarine". Look how young we were. Mister Florian, if you allow me to finish my idea, I will explain what I think about August 23rd. Please... The army, and I mean the whole Romanian army executed the orders of General Sanatescu, Antonescu's successor. I suppose you know that that time, the army was devoted to the Marshall If it weren't for a military with the moral probity of Sanatescu Niki, I don't want to offend you, but you have serious gaps. That is why I brought you these books. I suggest you should start with Borovicka. Sit, Niki. Don't be formal. We have a friendly discussion. all me when you have something. Just because we are having a friendly talk, I consider that you when you affirm all these you offend the uniform and laugh at the military dignity. You are offending me now! I have a great respect for the army. But for me, army means Cpt. Valter Maracineanu, Col. Mihai Christodulo Cerchez means Marshall Averescu and General Berthelot. They represent the army for me and not your shitty Marshall. Read the books and I wait a phonecall from you. Pusa! Sleep tight, Pusa! Attention! The bride was kidnapped. The father of the bride wants to say some words. Dear guests, dear in-law, the duty of each parent is to raise the children, to make them good people, and to support them for good and for bad. The greatest joy is to see them happy and settled. Today, Angela and Eugen you made us happy. And for me? You are settled down now. From you and Irinuca I want a christening now. I want to ask the bride and groom not to be angry at an old man maybe they won't go to America. Colonel let them go. They went to better, not to worse. Let them go to America. Let them go to America, to see how it is like. In the end they will return here, close to mommy and daddy. I wish them a good life in America. Papa, unzip me! Papa, can you see something? You cannot see anything now. Ask me after 3 months. If I stay like this, can you see it? September 11. Rispelidon once a day, every morning. Anafranil, half a pill every 8 hours, before meals. Stresigal 20 mg, twice a day 5 days week, after lunch. Desyrell - once a day. Supradyn once a day. I wrote on each pack. Good afternoon, colonel. Can you wait a second? We are not ready yet! Niki! Come on, Niki, you can come in now. Come into the bedroom. What do you say about Pusa? Isn't she sweet? Who is sweet? Look at his face, he doesn't understand. Niki, what day is today? Mrs. Doina, I am sorry. I thought about that but I think we cannot go. Do you know how old is Florian today? I thought you will be upset... but please try to understand us. I am sorry, it is not possible to go... There are not 6 months since the tragedy with Mihai. Pusa neither is not in the mood. Pusa, we discussed. We don't have a present. We cannot go. We can give him the porcelain Chinese fisherman. Florian will be happy. Florian doen not want a present from you. Florian is a generous man. He likes to make presents. You must come, Niki. It will be an unforgettable party. Mickey Mouse. Pusa is the fairy, Florian is a badger and I will be a biscuit. It looks very good on you. The rest of your costume is on the hanger over there. Doina, but the ears aren't they small? When did you last see a cartoon? Niki, what is this? The children sent a card to Florian. Doina brought it to show us. I read it: "Dear papa, I hope that my greetings will arrive on your birthday. I would have liked to send you the record with Scott McKenzie but you better buy it yourself when you will come here on Christmas. Which is very good because the little Valentin will be one month old. The doctors told me he is good and I should be prepared on November 7th. Happy anniversary. Kisses on the nose. Angela." By the way, Niki, do you know that Doina's mother was born the same day as our Mihaita? Really, ask her! So, Niki, soon you will be a grandfather. Can I see it? Shall we show it to him? Did Eugen send you an invitation? No, Angela did. If we waited for Eugen... I am glad. We would have go too, if Pusa was better... Niki, you have time next year. I regret she wrote so little. I wanted to know how her pregnancy is if she is still sick You heard the dosctor said it is ok. But why do they want to name him Valentin. What, don't you like valentin? Doina, but why Angela does not write to us? You know, Niki. Angela is more attached to Florian. Attached is too much to say. Angela loves Florian more. Doina, but she loves us too. So, do you call before leaving your house? So, Niki?... We come. October 25 (radio) Do you know what day is today? (radio) I am a student, 19 years old. Today is the day of the army. (radio)Do you know the significance of this day? (radio)I don't know. (radio) it was freed the last... Satu Mare.. I don't know what... (radio) the country was redeemed of fascists (radio) I swear to respect the tricolor flag, a symbol of unity and national independence, honour and military glory of my country - Romania... Yes. Good morning.Niki Ardelean. Look, Florian. Niki is here, wearing the uniform.
