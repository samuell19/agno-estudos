(Orchestra Music) i'm from the daily tribunal... disgusted with your wild expression i warn you i'll have no more of it. if necessary i'll cancel your charge accounts that would soon start a rumor that you were in financial difficulty i'll handle that situation should it arise i demand that you respect my wishes (Dramatic Music) i uh i want to see mr kirkland oh i'm sorry but mister listen don't you worry about it people like to be interviewed it makes them feel important wow did anyone ever tell you you're pretty? oh please please don't go in there you'll get me in trouble. times i think a good spanking is what you need. that's a good time to save relax relax who are you? what do you want? i'm kenny blake from the daily tribune we understand you plan a consolidation with the craig jordan is with change of control and complete reorganization what i plan is of no concern to the daily tribune i have nothing to say for publication good afternoon yeah but there's an unusual angle to this story mr kirkland think of it you and jordan from the same small town he grew up together as boys business rivals for years why are their yarns loaded with human interests yeah what a human interest i told you i have nothing to say for publication i am not interested in human interest very popular it increases the circulation uh look uh mr kirkland if you could just give me a brief sketch of the personal angle Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. don't you understand the english language what i plan is my own private business i don't care to discuss it with you or anyone else look good afternoon you found your way in here i imagine you can find your way out again sure that's easy same way i came in well thanks too bad you must have had a complete pressure did i what else no story no human

carefree moment it might be amusing to see what you do with that carefree moment might be an experience you'd never forget too or by the way just so you don't get lost i'm at the daily trivia yeah i know you could be one of the best if you keep your mind on the job but you're slipping and it's because you're getting a callus on your belly from leaning up against bars you must that kirkland assignment all you could talk about was a pair of good-looking gams and that's not my idea of a story oh but ward she was a dream she was helping out of this world well you'll be out of a job if you don't get wise to yourself because a smart guy like me is not going to go on working for starvation wages all day long starvation wages are better than starvation without wages who's talking about starving you know what i'm going to do i'm going to find myself a wealthy heiress i'm going to make her fall in love with him i'm gonna marry her and then i'll buy this paper uh but don't worry you

too how'd you know my name i get around i'm glad you got it on the living i don't like the idea of playing around with another guy's wife why didn't you tell me he was your husband i took it for granted you knew i was mrs kirkland why should you take it for granted he's old enough to be your father and that's the way it looked to me kenny don't be like that i didn't think of anything except that it made me happy to be with you and there's been very little happiness in my life since i've been married he was very thoughtful and gentle before we were married i thought i loved him but he changed immediately he became domineering and constantly nagging about money he's a wealthier and yet he would scream and ask me every time i wanted to spend a dime why didn't you divorce him he's too smart to give me grounds for divorce he will come through with a decent settlement he expects me to walk out with nothing after all these years i've spent with him and i won't do it but money isn't everything we don't need his dog you say you love me i do kenny i love you with all my heart but i'm entitled to that money and i'll not be cheated out of it i should have a right to feel that way of course i do and i'm not thinking of just myself i want to share it all with you i want us to have all the joy in the world and not just scrimp along on a salary think of all the accidents that happen every day nothing ever happens to him yeah a nice fatal accident to be swell but you can't make an accident happen where to do the most good why not i wouldn't be an accident then but you could help me make it look like one you got the wrong guy not even for you kenny kenny you can't blame me if i have crazy ideas i feel so miserable and helpless it drives me frantic there's never been anyone but you that i could talk to sure i know how you feel but believe me murder is not the right answer i guess you'll never really love me maybe we have different ideas about love your kind seems to have a string attached to it a nice long string wouldn't even let us shove off together now you you better take another look through the rogues gallery yes kenny oh it's been a tough night seeing you me too kenny i'm in frightful trouble and i don't know what to do police no nothing as simple as that tell me about it can i have a drink first i need it sure i knew harvey kirkland was cold rather than selfish but i never dreamed anyone could be so utterly proud what did he do nothing yet but he plans to frame me with surge of testimony what do you mean framingham he's going to sue for divorce he's hired witnesses to purge themselves and telling a nasty story oh he can't get away with that oh yes he can he has money enough to get away with anything and i haven't the money is fighting they'll blacken my name and they'll be able to throw me out without a dime he's bluffing oh no he isn't you don't know him he hates me he'll gladly spend any amount of money to take a sprite for revenge rather than give me what i'm entitled to have kenny what am i gonna do keep your chin up we'll figure out some of the stuff life could be so wonderful would be so happy if he was out of our way we'd be rich have all the money we could possibly want we get away from here go to rio rival where there's life and music he owns a mountain watch where he likes to go once in a while to rest and relax before he says when he leaves the highway he turns off on a narrow winding road where an accident could easily happen and every time he makes that trip we hope he'll go off the edge of one of those hairpin turns yeah return to the wheel would pay off big but you can't send a car over a bank by wishing i know that's just the trouble how about another drink i could choose one hey some uh some girl named tony called up we'll see you right away huh it's nice well if you don't want her i'll take her hey sober is a judge too sober if you ask me where'd you have me come here for is that smart there's no one else in my house kenny we've got that right away he's on his way up the lodge and we'll not have another chance like this he'll start the divorce so as soon as he comes back are you sure you want to go through with this of course i do kenny your plan is good and you can count on me to carry my end we mean too much to each other you can't let me down i'm not gonna let you down that's where you want it to where it's gonna be did you invite me up here just for the pleasure of having a fight i hope you'll be ready to show a little common sense is our common sense way of submitting to highway robbery you've been trying to maneuver me into a corner where you steal my shirt i've been trying to salvage something from a badly mismanaged business and i don't feel like playing santa claus you've been secretly buying up stock so you could grab control of the merger but you're not going to get away with it i'll stop you if i have to break your knife you always were a stubborn right about time you grew up what do you want excuse me mr kirkland but i wasn't expecting it and i'm kind of low on provisions put on the village and get what you want yes sir it'll take quite a while this ain't working like she should on the uphill pool harvey i'm sorry i blew my top oh forget it we've known each other too many years i didn't take it seriously but here we won't have any difficulty at all aiming at this business uh tony is certainly a beautiful woman tony is certainly an extravagant headache she's made it quite clear that her chief interest in me is financial i'm sorry to hear that don't shed any tears on my account doesn't bother me much anymore i walked back to the ranch house and telephone you put the car out of commission all right good morning uh might i use your telephone my car broke down come in phone's over yonder now this is just about the jumping off place i don't see a car traveling this road once in a blue moon let's forget this business for a while and go fishing i brought up some new tackle i'd like to try on all right there's no hurry about this hello hello harvey harvey i'm in a horrible mess well i was driving up the lodge because i had to see you right away my car broke down what do you want to see me about i can't tell you over the phone won't you come down and get me it won't take very long thanks harvey oh and do be careful driving down that road there's so many dangerous curves your tender concern overwhelms me but don't worry i've been in that road many times before right like that tony was coming up to see me about something or other money probably her car broke down i've got to go get her would you mind getting the car out for me please not at all why don't you let me get her i don't mind making the trip oh go ahead and enjoy your fishing i'll see you later delay okay um okay yeah you've got the story i told him when he's coming to get me i got in the car we'll meet him up the road away nice come up behind those trees we'll walk up the hill okay foreign this is it he's gotta come through i hear a here get in that quick that's right start to fall apart gonna mess up the works if he doesn't get out of here who is he this is a private road to the lodge no one lives up i wonder if they wouldn't here these things so they stay together a while i approve this thing for the 18 years what are we gonna do sit tight that's all we can do we can't take a chance on being seen up here what a filthy break everything was perfect until that yoko came along and started to fall apart so what are you doing way up here i started to walk the road to meet you and i'm afraid i've sprained my ankle that's a mathematician thing to do once you wait at the car i know it was we helped me put on my shoe what's the matter with you get a hold of yourself don't fall up we got to put him in the car yeah all right all right wait a minute come on let's go come on let's get out of here that's right well a big story breaks and i find you half plastered i ought to fire you for this you're a sucker if you don't i swore i'd make a newspaper man out of you and i hate to admit that i'm licked you call me a sucker you're the world's champion there's not a man or woman on this paper that has your ability and if you're trying your best to make a [ __ ] out of yourself go on pour it on board i gotta kill it well never mind skip it for now but you're not stupid kenny you know you've got two strikes on you before you start now cut out this foolishness and get down to business all right ward what's the assignment was killed in a motor accident he's a big shot and the story's worth a spread right it up from all angles with a lot of human interest on it surprised hello i come to homicide squads investigating an accident that was no accident that was murdered well unless you think it was murder that car wasn't driven off the road the ignition was off and it wasn't in gear the corpse doesn't bleed so we know that kirkland was dead when he was placed behind the wheel that can't be he doesn't have an enemy in the world him and this fella was having quite a heated coral before i left he called mr kirkland a crook and threatened to break his neck now that made exactly friendly words we had a disagreement over a business deal but he's exaggerating the incident i know what i heard and i ain't exaggerating nothing sit down we'll talk about that later suppose you explain this business to you well for some time kirkland's tried to absorb my business in consolidation were you agreeable well not completely was he in a position to use pressure yes in a way but i had nothing to worry about harvey and i were friends how about a picture gorgeous oh sure it's good on it uh i'm sorry to bother you at a time like this mrs kirkland but might we have a picture certainly i don't mind this this puts us in an awful spot what are we going to do don't be silly but you can't let jordan take the wrap for us are you turning out to be a jellyfish you certainly fooled me i counted on the help of a man oh i don't know this whole thing's thrown me for a loss i can't think straight then you'd better let me do your thinking for you look tony it's one thing to kill a man and take your chances on getting caught kenny we're tied together if you crack up and do something foolish you'll drag me into it would it make you feel better to see me in his place no i don't talk like that then pull yourself together because we're heading in that direction look if the law makes a mistake that isn't your responsibility think about us kenny we have all the world and all of life out of it we'll leave here as soon as i settle the estate and we'll be so happy we'll forget all about everything that ever happened here we've got clear sailing guinea don't rock the bone all right baby all right anything you say hey you know kenny i can't get that jordan trial out of my mind when a thing bothers me i've got to do something about it i want you to bother because i've got a hunch that jordan is not guilty oh i know the only fingerprints found on the car belonged to jordan and to kirkland the caretaker testified that there was not another soul in the district and he passed no one on the road mrs kirkland wasn't in her car when he drove by but she claimed she was over the ranch house teleporting we've got no time check to disprove her story besides it's not the kind of a job that a woman could do by herself it looked like they had an airtight case against jordan and they convicted him they did not establish sufficient motive for the murder well i've said a lot of times i'd like to break your neck that didn't mean that i had any intention of doing it i'm glad you're only kidding that's a load off my mind i'll bet my shirt but there's a motive for this kirkland murder that hasn't been uncovered and if or when it is then you'll have your real murderer boy would that be a story living or dead i'll not be just out of that money with the world leading the broke of his estate to charity i earned every dime of it by putting up with him as long as i did i'm going to have it i'll break that quill baby you get a third the law guarantees you that why don't you take it and be satisfied are you crazy the less i mixed up with the law the better i like it something might backfire i can't understand anyone being so eager to toss off a fortune tony you always hit the wire first with me the money came in a very poor so it's beginning to look like it was the other way around with you well i'm not gonna be cheated on something that belongs to me but i'm afraid the price for it did say there was no one else around that day but i saw a stranger drive down the road quite a while after mrs kirkland telephone you think you'd recognize him if you saw him again i don't know i might if i saw him in the car i think i'd recognize the car did you see mrs kirkland again yes she come back to phone her husband again a short time after that fella drove down the road but she didn't get no answer that time she was pretty mad about her husband not coming together and she called up a garage in the village to send someone out to fix her car she seemed on an awful hurry to get away said she better wait in that car maybe she didn't think i was good enough to live hello kenny hello warren what's on your mind plenty since when did you get interested in women isn't everybody i suppose so you know kenny i've got a hunch that i can smoke out of story on this kirk murder and i kind of like to have somebody to talk it over with so i well it helps me fit the pieces together yeah sure go ahead and bounce your ideas off me well i've been trying to dig up all i could about mrs kirkland before she was married and if she wasn't a gold digger she was a reasonable facsimile now maybe she was in love with kirkland and maybe she wasn't maybe she went overboard for some guy closer to her own age and then became impatient to cash in on the kirkland marriage that story would fit in nicely with the mysterious stranger who was seen in the locality from the day that kirkland was murdered serious strangers mm-hmm where'd you dream that one up i didn't dream it up he was seen driving down the road and i'll bet he could be identified if i could find him and i'd be very much interested to know what he was doing there at that time that would give me a believable motive for murder and then two i'd like to probe into mrs kirkland's romance if any lord with your imagination you ought to be doing a comic strip yeah but i do all right at that you know when i get a hunch i put my imagination to work on all angles and then i want to see which one would pan out yeah but when i turn in a story it's got to be facts not imagination has all this heavy thinking uh giving you a thirst how about a shot no not nothing i want you don't mind if i have one no go ahead no one's okay two not too good three could be bad i'll engrave those words of worse i'm on the bottle they do you more good than the caption 100 proof now assuming that tony kirkland is mixed up in this murder she'd need help and that mysterious stranger fits perfectly into the picture if i could only put my finger on him or some clue that would lead me to him i'm sorry to revive unhappy memories mrs kirkland but i was sure that you'd be willing to assist in any way that you can naturally won't you sit down thank you that perfume smells familiar that's quite possible anyone can buy it if they feel that extravagant i can't recall why it should seem familiar but i don't suppose it's worth bothering but is it how do you think i can be of assistance oh i'm sorry i allowed my thoughts to ramble i believe you said that you waited in your car all the time except when you went to telephone that's right can you tell me who passed along the road while you were waiting in your car the lord was deserving no one passed by are you sure of course i'm sure you believe that craig jordan deserves to die the law sounding guilty of murder why should i question the verdict oh it's just a passing thought well thank you very much i'm sorry i couldn't tell you anything you've told me all that i wanted to know good afternoon oh mr mckee yes i am maybe stupid i can't understand the reason for your visit well a story is the breath of life to a newspaper man he can't pass up any possibility i see but uh why did you expect to find a story here mr mckee i always expect to find the story any place you see i get a hunch once in a while about something and uh gives the boys quite a laugh but i like to snoop around and see if it amounts to it well good afternoon mrs kirkland good afternoon what's he doing here let's go in the library what did the key want he asked me if i saw anyone else on the road that day i told him i didn't oh he knows you lied the woman at the ranch house saw me and he's got a pretty good idea as to why he lied even so it won't get him anywhere tony i i'm afraid of my key you don't know that guy when he once sells himself an idea he won't give up on it until he's proved it one way or the other he can't prove anything if we sit tight and keep our mouth shut maybe you're sorry you ever had the misfortune to meet me don't mean that you know i'm crazy about you but can't you see we're running the risk of losing everything by trying to grab too much maybe we're playing with dynams if mckee should ever find out about you and me he'd put two and two together and we wouldn't like the answer don't be silly mckee is not superman and we're playing for a fortune not me baby what i did i did for you or for some other guy's dough you sold me a beautiful idea about life and love and gay all right let's go where we can have something who's that how do i know i'm alan webb mrs kirkland is expecting me if the wave is calling oh ask him to come in yes ma'am this way please i'm sorry if i'm intruding oh not at all uh mr blake mr webb mr blake is a newspaper man i'm very glad to meet you he did good publicity never heard a case what do you mean case i'm representing mrs kirkland in a reference to abrogate the injustice of her late husband's will well i see thanks for the interview mr kirkland i'll be going now excuse me okay you're going through with it are you i am well i think you're making a mistake and i hope i'm wrong won't you sit down thank you in the effort to have a will set aside there are two means of attack first that the testator was subject to undue influence or second but he was of unsound mind at the time of the execution of the will yes i would say that uh unappreciation of you would be evidence of an unsound mind oh that's very sweet of you to say so is that your personal or legal opinion both but i doubt if that much trouble quite sees the argument from my point of view well i'm sure you know how to present an argument to make it most effective your taste in art seems somewhat on the morbid side working around the newspapers enough to make anybody more but isn't it i think you've got something there hey is there someone around your name mckee could be who are you well that's not important i've got some information i think you'd like to have well mckee is a very busy man i'd suggest that you write a letter asking for the point oh i ain't going to write no letters to nobody now look here young color i drove all the way down here to talk to him and it's a long way and lizzy almost coughed up a cylinder um i'll take over what information are you talking about are you mckee no and what are you asking so many questions for you better give me your story i'll take it to mckee it's got news value i guarantee you'll be paid for it no i ain't going to talk to nobody but mckee but i'm afraid you're not going to talk to anybody but he hasn't got time to see everybody barges in well if that's the case i guess i'd better go oh mr mckee what about these papers take him over here to jackson your name mckee that's right well i've got some information that'll knock your eye out yeah what about the kirkland murder case who are you i'm the caretaker at the kirkland place oh you come in my office kenny come on in this may turn out to be a story for you to work on sit down all right let's have it well if you remember i swore in court there was nobody with mr jordan back in the mountains the day mr kirkland was killed yes i remember well i was mistook i was talking to mrs harper the other day her and her husband live on that ranch just off the highway she told me about you being there and about telling you about a stranger she saw driving down the road well sir i got the figure that somebody was lying and i know that i wasn't deliberately lying so i've done a little scouting around and what do you think i found what did you find well sir i found tire tracks where a car had been grip off the road and hid in the bushes right close to where lizzy started shedding that day and i bet you there was a settlement there all the time i was fixing her what do you say they why because i found footprints of course it wasn't very plain anymore but there was plenty enough for me to see if there was a man and a woman we're closing in i've pinned that murder on her and her boyfriend and what a story that'll make now you can take a bow on this one yeah for when you get it of course i'll get it it's wide open all i've got to do is fill in a few details nice going i'll see that you're well paid for your trouble oh ain't necessary but i'd be happy if you did later hello there try to keep me from talking to you why he uh he wouldn't tell me what he wanted i thought he was some kind of a crackpot oh sure i see what you mean look will you show us where that place is sure be glad to all right you go wind up lizzie and get going we'll meet you on the mountain road i'll need a head start lizzy ain't perking like you used to all right kenny you better come along with me and we better take your car get a photographer because we might want some pictures be ready to leave in half an hour i've never been wrong in my life when i followed a hunch and this one is running true to form yeah hunch mckee the wizard of the press that'll make you take out a clairvoyance license yeah wow operate operator they do not answer they've got to answer don't tell me that i'm sorry i only make the connection i do not bring to the other party nice to get out in the country i thought you'd rather come out here for a business conference it's a wonderful idea we'll stop a little roadhouse i know it's a great little place i'm sure you like it i'm sure i will you know i always thought attorneys were so cold-blooded that depends on the case and also the client i think where's kenny blake i told him to be ready to start in half an hour i don't know we'll call up joe's bar and see if he's there well what happened to you i uh guess i can't go with you i tripped and fell on the stairs no liquor i uh afraid i sprained my wrist well that's too bad kenny you go ahead and see the doc and get it fixed up i'll take pete along with me well those are the breaks that accident may have cost you the chance to be in on a whale of a big story i'll tell you all about it when we get mr back is on the phone tell him i'm not in just a moment i'll see she's in mr blake is on the telephone i'm not in yes mr scotland is not at home oh hello lord hello kenny how's the riff first oh it's okay that's good something on your mind again yeah i seem to be headed up a blind alley i know that tony and some man lay and wait for kirkland and murdered him then they put him in the car and shoved him over the cliff but i can't get the first face until i find out who the guy is and she won't lead me to it she's playing around with some lawyer named webb seems to be crazy about him but he's not the man i want i verified he was in court the day of the murder a perfect alibi are you are you sure about this guy webb of course i'm sure i've got a private detective's report on her believe me it's nothing she can be proud of that's that's a sweet payoff for the guy who committed the murder isn't it what could he expect anyone who'd go for a pony like her can't be very bright i found some footprints in pretty good shape had faster casts made of them but i can't spring that until i find the guy that made the footprints and i haven't much time unless the governor grants a reprieve craig jordan may be executed before i can break the story and kenny an innocent man is going to die even in the darkest hour of human existence there is always at hand an unfailing source of comfort to any who are willing to accept it man can be in no extremity where the tender mercy of our lord cannot reach him it's justice not mercy i need i'm not a murderer harvey kirkland is my friend and i did not kill him the man who killed harvey will be guilty of tumors if he allows me to die in his place you can pray for him he'll need your prayers more than i mm-hmm hello mckee speaking subject in the same escort had just left the silver slipper okay go to bed that certainly was a wonderful show i'm tired oh well let me get you that agreement before i forget it have that wait until tomorrow dear all right darling alan couldn't you hurry with that stupid legal business so that i could get my money i know sweden i'm as impatient as you but the law must take it slow and proud of its course there's no way of hurrying yes we'll find life so wonderful alan with all the money we could possibly want we'll be able to go anywhere do anything you like you and i together where there's life and music and gay headline sounds familiar tony kenny if he told me what you were he was wrong you're worse you're crazy you're drunk get out of here you're broke into the house and i'm perfectly justified in killing you in self-defense you've raised murder to a high degree of efficiency tony nothing can stop me from doing what i came here to do are you all alex i i guess so my head feels like a i really oh baby you had your saying now i'll have mine i told you there was something i had to do no kenny you can't why not you're not sick kenny i didn't know what i was doing i was terrified you get me into trouble with the law but i've always loved you you have a funny way of trying i'll prove it to you any way you want me to i'll go whoever you say anything you want i thought you were the most wonderful thing in the world i loved you i still do that's my tough one but if i let you get away with this now go on doing it all the rest of your life even if they tried you for murder you'd find some fool on the jury who wouldn't convict you please follow me baby i won't be alone uh foreign oh mr blake did you drop too much you've been taken again it's far better off you'll be if you're armed and been to the elbow you're right maggie i know i'm right it's mr elsa buried a husband in a drunken squad and a finer man you'd never hope to know when he left the creature alone i got a byline on a front page spread yo maggie it's funny how murder steps up on a person it is that i could murder in full blood the blackguard who choose tobacco around here and is no judge of distance it's all in the day's work and i went after an interview with harvey kirkland but it didn't seem like i picked a bad time hello mckay what do you want what's happened here plenty you smell a story almost before it happens don't you well go ahead in lieutenant edwards with the homicide squads in there thanks man you tell me looks like murder and suicide or double murder i don't know yet for sure what's tony kirkland that's right how come you're johnny on the spot were you expecting something like this i was following up a hunch that's all looks like i was right you late to do any good who's this his name's alan webb that's all i know so far following a hunch is a very thin excuse for you coming here i'll come clean now what do you know about this i was following a hunch that's all i believe that this ties in with the murder of harvey kirkland and that there's a story here that would save craig jordan if they could talk i was on that jordan case and there was plenty of evidence to prove him guilty yeah i know you had everything except a motive and no murder was ever planned without a whale of a strong motive lieutenant take a look at this i sit on a bench out there and stuck my hand in a puddle of blood over there neither of that parents i could have made it from here this blood must have been spilled by a third party i don't need a ward mckee hunch to show me the pattern of this take two men one woman and a gun stir them well you got a murder happens every time it could still tie in with a murder harvey kirkland could tie in with the war but i don't believe it does i'll send out a general alarm to pick up a wounded man come on foreign hmm here it is kenny you lost yeah i remember i had a hunch this was it kenny but i couldn't prove anything i had to have a confession so i warned if i'd been really smart i didn't know that i had to end this way it had to be get me the emergency hospital still want the emergency hospital? no. no, never mind give me the morgue.
