A SHOCHIKU PRESENTATION Produced by: Hikaru Suzuki A film by Yoshimitsu Morita KITCHEN Hello. Hello. Are you hungry? A bit. I'm starving. Shall we have eat together? That sounds good. Here's your order. Are you tired after the funeral? Thank you for helping me to arrange everything. Now that your grandma died, the house will be too big for you alone. Maybe I should move out, but... You could move in with me. My mum will be all for it... Where do you live? Near Kita Park. It's a nice area. Why don't you come over? How about tonight at 8 pm? If you're free. Thank you. I mean it. I gave you the map for a reason. These pickles are delicious! Everything is amazing here. Katsudon, pickles and the miso soup - everything. In other places, there's always something that's not good. The owner's children must be happy. Who cooks in your family? My mum and I, but we can't make it good. So, you're not happy? You have a good taste, though. I think the food is great here. That's what everyone says. Not everyone. Otherwise, this place would be crowded. Good evening. - Welcome, come in. - Sorry to disturb. You're just in time. This is a present for you. This might be better than the katsudon and the pickles from that place. Thank you! If that's true, I can just eat rice with these pickles. Nice packaging. Look, our fridge is very big. I'll be putting this diamond in the vault. - Make sure no one steals it. - Right. Wow, amazing! My mum and I watch a lot of American movies. So, we can't imagine our kitchen without a packed fridge. That's so cool. You have so many utensils. We like stuff to look good. Like a contemporary art museum. Let it just sit here and please the eye. Looks like you hardly ever cook, though. That's not true. I hope you meant that everything is very neat. How about moving in here? You can change the design of the room, of course. You can replace the bed, too, if you don't like it. You don't read here? I'm used to reading on the sofa in the living room. I could read here, no problem. Then, you can take a nap. - It smells sweet. - It's perfume. It seems to me that your mother is a mysterious woman. It must be her. - This is Miss Mikage Sakurai. - Nice to meet you. I'm Eriko, Yuichi's mum. - Nice to meet you. - Yuichi told me about you. Make yourself at home. I'm glad you came. You look even better in real life. - We will take care of you. - Thank you very much. Yuichi, I have a lot of customers today. I'm sorry, but I have to go. Will you stay the night? We can talk tomorrow morning. You are as wonderful as I thought of you. Miss Mikage Sakurai. Watch some TV. I will accompany mum and get back. See you later! - You didn't watch TV? - No, I was meditating. What did you think about my mum? She's very respectable. - Shall we drink? - I will make something. Well, how about tea? - Strong tea is the best. - I like strong tea, too. Wow, so amazing! - This one is cute. - Will you drink cold tea? A friend from Kanazawa gave me this. - It will go well with strong tea. - Let me try, then. I'd like to take advantage of the atmosphere and ask you something. Tell me the truth. Sounds scary. Should I be afraid? Depends on your reaction. You see, my mum is a man. But you said it was your mum. Do you think it'd be appropriate to call her my dad, then? So, who gave birth to you? When she was young, she used to be a man. And she had a wife, too. Her wife is my real mum. What is she like? She died when I was a little boy. My parents also died when I was still a child. So, you also know what it's like to grow up alone. Can you tell? Your grandma told me when I was working in the flower shop. She treated you as a daughter, not as a granddaughter, though. I know a lot about you thanks to her. Tell me more things about your dad. Or mum. Eriko left work after my real mother passed away. She raised me. Soon after that, she decided to become a woman. She spent all savings on me and got into debt. She owned an establishment, and we lived off its profits. She did it all by herself. - What a life span. - It's still going on! So, this is the room of Eriko's son? - You can tell because it looks different? - It reflects the way you are. What will you do? Will you stay with us? I'll go home today. I have a lot of stuff to move... - I can help you. I have a big car. - Thanks. - Well, I'll give you a ride. - It's okay, the train... I'll take a taxi. I want to reflect alone on the way back. There are no available taxis right now. Take a seat in the back. You'll have space to reflect alone there. All right? Just don't mind me while I drive. Thank you for everything today. - It was really nice. - Huh? Hello. - Landlord. - How are you? - Have you found a new tenant? - That's right, Miss Mikage. There's a whole family. I'd be glad to have them move in already, but if things are not quite arranged yet, I can wait a bit. I think two or three days will be enough. - Where are you moving? - To a place near Kita Park. There are a lot of expensive houses in that location. The rent must be expensive too? - You don't have to worry about it. - I see. Sorry for looking like I prompted myself upon you. I will pay you a visit later. Very well. Well, then, Miss Mikage, I won't disturb you any longer. Good luck. Hello. Hello? Mikage? Long time no see. What have you been up to? I'm in the middle of moving out. There's nothing but my phone left. Really? What if something dangerous happened and we couldn't call each other? That's mean... It really is not. Do you want to hang out? If you're free, of course. Sure. The weather is nice. The pressure is high. But it might start raining anytime soon. We haven't seen each other for so long, yet we're talking about weather. How are you doing, Shigeru? Good. Although I wasn't lately. - And you? - I'm in great shape. Hey, hey. - I found a nice place to stay. - Will you live alone? - No, I'll live together with a man. - Huh? Mikage, what's going on? Don't beat around the bush. Let's be honest with each other. - But I'm telling the truth. - Who is this man, then? Actually, there are two men in that house. What?! Hey, is there anything else you want to tell me? - There's so much stuff... - You're a life saver. I'll get the things inside. No need. Just leave them as it is. All right, I will not touch your things. Who knows what secrets and treasures might be there? - Exactly. - Okay, I'll see you later. If you like them, I can bring more. A tomato salad will look good in these bowls. Actually, I was eating tomato salad from them the day before yesterday. Is that true? What dressing did you make? - Soy sauce. - I like that one, too. - What about Eriko? - The same one. That's perfect. It's inconvenient when everyone has different preferences. - I got something for you, too. - What is it? You might have people you want to notify about changing your address and phone number. Nice excuse. You probably wanted to purchase this yourself. Yes. And now I have a good pretext. All thanks to you, Miss Mikage. What will I do about the rent? - Forget about it. - That's not right... Then, talk to my mother about it. Look at this word processor. See, our names are coming. Mikage Sakurai Yuichi Tanabe Eriko Tanabe - Good morning. - Morning! Did you sleep well? Apparently, you didn't if you're up so early. Thank you! - There's so much light here. - That's right. I bought this place because of large windows, but it turned out they are on the south side. There's too much vitamin D for an owl like me. - Shall I cook something for you? - Really? I'd be so happy! - What would you like? - Rice would be good. I get it. You can watch the news meanwhile. It'll be done quickly. You're so reliable! It's so noisy. Be quiet, people. Breaking news! Singer Junji Shimada and actress Sakiko got divorced. I knew they would split up. That's not exactly news. Mrs. Eriko! Wow, it looks yummy. - Have a seat. - Yes. Thanks for the meal. It looked delicious, and tastes ten times better. - You look like Non-chan when you smile. - Who is that? A puppy, a dog. Yuichi was saying that you and Non-chan look like each other. I hope that dog is not a Saint Bernard? No way. It was an Akita mix. - It was a really cute dog. - "Was"? Its death really shocked Yuichi. He even got a flu. He almost died. That's why he cares about you so much. Say... I heard Yuichi knew your grandma. Yuichi was the one who cried the most during her funeral. That kid had a strange upbringing. - He has his flaws. - What flaws? He's spoiled rotten. And absent-minded. Very picky about people. Also he's bow-legged. But he has a good heart. So, don't worry. He's kind, that's true. He's just trying to match your kindness. - You're leaving? - I'll bring some water. I just wanted to ask for it. You can stay here as long as you want. You're a nice girl. I can see it. Having nowhere to go is tough when you're going through things. Don't worry about anything. We're here for you. Okay? Thank you very much. I will pay the rent on time. Please let me stay here until I find another place to live. You don't have to do any work around the house. It's okay, I'll have you make something for me next time. I'm not confident, you make really good rice porridge. It's much better than Yuichi's or mine. I'm feeling energetic. Time to tidy up. You're still young, so get some sleep. I'm writing to inform you that I have moved. Please send any letters to the following address... I see, Miss Mikage, the address you moved to is the same one as mine. Kita Koenmae 1-3, number 307. Here. Are you having trouble at work? Mum and I are rich. What work would we even do? You probably don't have any idea. It's okay, we maybe do something that might get us caught by the police. Anyway, use the room however you want. And keep doing what you like without worrying. That's a pity! Why? Because, if you crossed a dangerous bridge, I'd want to cross it with you. Those feelings are enough for me. Don't worry about us. Just get settled. I'm now more experienced in typing than the owner of this word processor. - Will they be happy? - Of course they will. - It's so heavy. - Hang in there... But it's so heavy! Why are the two of them sleeping like this without doing nothing? We, as adults, shouldn't pry into their matters. Really? But what are we going to do with the blender and fruits? First, we need to unpack everything. What if they can hear us talk? They'll know what we're up to! That's right! - Sorry to wake you up. - No wonder. We brought something amazing. Here's Miss Mikage. This is my friend, Miss Chika. Greet each other. I'm Miss Chika! We thought you were sleeping. Good that we were wrong. - We bought a blender. - And some fruits to blend. We can make juice in complete darkness. - Do you want to make it now? - That's right! Yuichi, read the manual, will you? You want juice, right? - Let's go wash the fruit. - Of course! It's strange that each one of us is washing fruit. - Don't get any weird thoughts. - But... - It's like we're washing a baby. - So, let's exchange babies. - Look, mine is bigger. - And mine is more nutritious. - Mine has a brighter color. - And mine has more vitamins. Are you feeling itchy? - Yuichi, have you figured it out? - Yes, it took me a while. Everything is ready for the show. Mikage, what kind of juice do you want? Since you washed all of it, I'd like a mix. A mix juice it is! It's not so easy to find the right proportions. Would you like to try different colors? We have to unplug all the other electrical products. I'd rather turn off the lights if possible. - Are you afraid the fuse box will blow? - Of course. It's all right. But there's water and electricity here. It's just as dangerous as with the washing machine. It's better to unplug everything. I see, so you're saying that a blender is like a washing machine? It might be a good idea to make juice in the dark. - It's like we're wizards. - That's what I wanted to say! I turned on an iron and a hair dryer recently. And the fuse blew. It was scary. But it has nothing to do with that. I just like darkness. Let's do that, Mikage. I'm home. Grandma, what should we cook? I brought a lot of groceries. Grandma? Are you sleeping? Grandma. What are you doing here at this hour? I bought a lot of groceries. But Yuichi said he wanted to eat ramen, so I'm making some. Yuichi! Yuichi! Yuichi! Yuichi! Yuichi? I'm awake. Don't be mean. I thought you were dead. I wanted to scare you. Hey, can you make me some ramen? I'm hungry. You asked grandma to make it, didn't you? Huh? But isn't your grandma dead? What are you making? You're up? I decided to cook ramen. - How strange. - Huh? In my dream, you also said you wanted to eat ramen. I guess you were reading my mind. I'll make you something delicious. It will be good, like in a dream. Here you have. Looks exactly like what I had in mind. This ramen really comes from a dream. I will cook anything you like for you, not only ramen. Thank you for the meal. Cooking starts with chopping the ingredients. Try to arrange everything in such a way so as to please the eyes of your guests. Today we have a very important part, preparing the vegetables. Chateau potatoes, tourné mushrooms, cocotte carrots. It's the so-called French alphabet of vegetables. But, before we begin, let me introduce you my new assistants. Please welcome Tamie Matsubara, and Mikage Sakurai. We'll look forward to work with you! Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello, Tanabe residence. Who are you? To whom am I speaking? I'm home. I'm back. What did you just say? I was mumbling something I couldn't say out loud. Too bad I couldn't hear it. - I'm so tired... - Would you like a drink, then? That'd be great. Okay, I'm going to get changed. When did you make all these appetizers? Think of it as cooking practice, so don't worry about it. Mikage, every day is a celebration with you. Sorry, I called you Mikage. It's time to drop the Miss, Yuichi. Mikage, you don't seem well. Talk to me about it. I will never be a chef. I don't have a refined personality. You're unrefined? I don't wait until the temperature is right. Nor do I wait until all the water has evaporated. That kind of thing affects the taste of the food a lot. That might be true. But I love the food that has your character in it. This time, I suppressed my wishes, and did it perfectly. But, in class, I can't keep track of everything. I make mistakes. Mistakes? Is Mikage Sakurai here? Sorry, but who are you? I'm Okuno. I'd like to have a talk with you. Excuse me, but I'm at work now. If you don't mind, could you call my house in the evening? You mean, call Yuichi's place, then? I heard your voice over the phone. Mikage, can you talk outside? I'll ask the teacher nicely. Don't worry. We'll be quick. I want her to understand something. This is my workplace. She has nothing to do with it. Let's go outside. Are you Yuichi's friend? I wanted to ask you the same. - Are you staying with him? - I'm staying with him, yes. So, you don't live together? What do you mean when you say he's your friend? A man and a woman can't live alongside and be just friends. Yuichi keeps pretending there's nothing between the two of you. There is nothing between us. That's absolutely impossible. That just means you can't imagine it. Stop putting your thoughts into other people's heads. Well then, no matter how close Yuichi and I become, please don't get in the way. I'm... staying at his place on his permission. My grandmother died. And Yuichi knew her. Because he was an acquaintance of my grandmother, he helped me moving. Yuichi and his mum offered me to stay with them, until I can find a new place. I don't know if Yuichi explained you this or not. But that's all there is to it. You're avoiding all the hard parts of a relationship between a man and a woman. And you're enjoying only the nice bits. Do you always do things half-heartedly, without bearing the consequences? Anyway, the fact that Yuichi is behaving strange is all your fault. Even if there's nothing between Yuichi and you, I just can't stand this cool demeanor of yours. Just let Yuichi go. And hurry up and get out of his house. I resent the fact that you live off Yuichi. Leave for Yuichi's sake. Everyone... thinks only about their feelings. You don't really know how I feel. I didn't tell you anything. So, how can you know what I feel? You look composed, like you know everything. I know exactly the type of person you are. Your face disgusts me. I'm currently at work. If you want keep talking, I'll go grab a knife from the cooking class, then I'll come back in tears stab you. Is that what you want? I can't even be jealous of someone like you. What a relief! Excuse me now. Maybe you shouldn't be there if you have to listen to stuff like that? But it wasn't them who told me that. That woman had a sinister face. Enough about her. I can't think about her without getting angry. Mikage, I think I'm inferior to you, when it comes to cooking. Everyone thinks that about themselves. Not true. Your cooking is much better. You think so? My personality is getting in the way of my development. Do you practice at home? I want to make my host family happy by cooking good food for them. I have no one to cook for... I'm all alone. I'm a worse cook because I live alone. Darn it! Tamie... Mikage, I don't want to go home yet. Okay, I'll stay with you. Isn't anyone waiting for you at home? You're gonna be late. No one is back home yet. Mikage, I'm so lonely. Tamie, don't be sad. You're not alone. Welcome. - You're so fast. - That's because he's a man. Stop showing off just because you can't grow a beard. Don't be silly. Mikage? - Good evening. - Are you still awake? With that blush, you look like a doll. And you, Miss Eriko, looked like a man when you were eating ice-cream. I see, maybe her puberty has started? Are you having good sex? I need to buy something. Such a nasty girl. She's not one of the clients that can be moved by your words. - Good morning. - Morning. Yuichi sends his regards. He has the morning shift today. What are all these flowers for? They're not for St Valentine's Day. And it's not even my birthday. It's hard to be in the limelight. I'm worried, I'm his mum, after all. Yuichi haven't told you what's his job, right? I don't think his current job is what he really wants to do. That's why he didn't tell you. It's not that important, anyway. Yuichi works as a taxi driver with his car. Illegally? He has an arrangement with the club to pick up their clients. Not everyone can take his taxi. These flowers are for one of the hostesses. It's her birthday. I think it's a pretty tough job. It does seem to be. He doesn't have a fixed schedule. Sometimes he comes back smelling of perfume. Does that bother you? I'm trying not to think about it. That's probably the best solution. Everyone wants to know what their partner is up to, but that's arrogant. In order to understand why I decided to become a woman and a mother... it's necessary to know not only my physique, personality and upbringing, but also tens of thousands of keywords without which nothing can be explained. Who can be considered a close image of ourselves? One who perceives the world like we do and is willing to be in our shoes. Understanding that we're not alone fills our heart with tenderness and warmth. I'm only trying to understand the difference between the words been said and what he really is. I don't consider being honest sincere. Sincerity is the sense with which one chooses words accordingly. Speaking of balance in relationships, when someone imposes themselves, relationships turn sour. Is that what happened to yours? They didn't exactly turn sour, but... It's finally Sunday. If you're feeling this sad, then I'll be bothered too. I'm sorry I'm not feeling well. I'm sure I'm sleep deprived. I should go take a nap. Mikage! - I want to give you my clothes. - What? - I want you to wear them. - Your clothes, Miss Eriko? Our tastes are different. But maybe you'll find something you like. You just have to trust my taste. Okay, let's go. If you like something, I'll give it to you. Mikage, I want you to focus, not on the clothes, but on the interplay of our souls. So, expand your consciousness. And enjoy this Sunday afternoon with me. Let's learn together. - Sounds better than a nap. - Right, and much more fashionable. Grandma, I'll give Mikage my clothes. You can have this, too. It's not the same as when parents choose clothes for their children. Almost all of these are new. They're really new. Miss Eriko, you're extravagant. If you think something doesn't suit you, that means you're doubting your beauty, understand? It looks really good on you. I'm surprised. - Mikage, it's your style. - You think so? - Do you like it? - I do. You can have it. You can have them all, Mikage. Hello? Hello. It's Mikage. We need to talk. Can we meet? Where are you? I'm in a phone booth near Kita Park. I get it, I'll be right there. - Shall we walk around the park? - That's okay. - Yuichi? - Yes? I'm thinking of moving out. I noticed. Eriko told me about your job. Illegal taxi driver, that's cool. Why didn't you tell me? I need money to do what I really want to do. I want to raise enough money, no matter how. Because I'm attending cooking classes, I'm the only one in the house who doesn't earn, right? And who would cook delicious food for us? Who would make us happy? Even if Eriko and you are fine with it, I can't go on like that. I want to become more independent. I want to be self-confident and not worry about things. Then, I can come back to you. I don't understand your wishes. But I can't ignore them. I won't stop you. Have you made up your mind? Eriko did a lot for me. She supported me when I needed it the most. I'm grateful to her. Have you found a new place? My friend from the cooking class is looking for a roommate. Now you will be able to practice even more often. - Do your best. - I will. Ah, the sun is rising. I'm home. I bought some sushi. Let's eat. Mikage is not here anymore. We don't need so much food. If anything is left, we'll throw it away. It's better to have more than less. Neither of us can make sushi. I'll make some tea. Thank you. You moved again, huh? This time, you'll be staying with a girl? The story is getting more and more interesting. I think the way you're imagining this story is different from the way it really is. The story about how you got disappointed in love and chose friendship? You're wrong. But I like our rare meetings over a cup of tea. They help me to see how much I've grown. People find their place in life through disappointment. When disappointment is long enough, hope is born. Don't cry over a boyfriend who left you. Better meet new people over a cup of tea. No one left me. Shigeru, you're a fool. I'm glad we broke up. Maybe I'm a fool, but I know you. Pretending to be a fool while being preached... Anyway, good luck with your cooking classes. When you get really good, I will organize a party with your food. Thank you. - Then, I'll put the potatoes inside. - Yes. Too bad there's no one else here to taste it. - Thank you for the meal. - Thanks for the meal. The flavor is not bad. - Don't you think it's too spicy? - No. Not at all. - I hope it's our next guest. - Me too. Two people aren't enough. Hello? Hello? Is Mikage home? Yes. Who's asking? Well, tell her it's Miss Chika. Do you know a Miss Chika? Hello, Miss Chika? Long time no see. How are you doing, Mikage? Can we meet? I'm having dinner with a friend right now. That's a shame. What is it? - You have to wait a bit. - Invite him if he's a nice guy. Yes, he's nice, but he might seem a bit strange. I think it'll be fun! Miss Chika, where are you? We cooked some food. It's tasty, so please try it. Looks good. One can tell it was made by professionals. - Help yourself. - Thank you. - Thanks for this meal. - Yes. Is it no good, Miss Chika? - It's so good that tears will come out. - I'm so glad. What did you want to talk about? Eriko has gone away. She quit her job. And she's not at home either. So, where is she? - She was admitted to a hospital. - What's wrong with her? Her mind. It's so lonely without Eriko, somehow. I haven't been going to work either. Hello. Mikage, is that you? Why didn't you tell me? Oh, you mean about Eriko? Who told you? I'll come by. I'm nearby. Is that okay with you? With you, the house will be back to life. It feels like Miss Eriko is about to get home with groceries. - Sorry I didn't tell you. - It's fine. Tell me what happened to Miss Eriko. She said she was having problems with her head and went to hospital. She said that about herself? She did. Maybe she couldn't get used to you not being here anymore. But she could have called me. I'm living alone for the first time. I'm feeling very lonely without you or Eriko. But you're busy with your cooking classes. And I don't want to call you all the time. I want to be strong. I want to see Miss Eriko! Can you visit patients on Sundays? - Yes, we can. - Then, shall we go there together? If that's fine with you, Yuichi. - You're in good shape. - My body is fine. But my head... Because of my decision to become a woman and a mother, My nerves sometimes get mixed up. And being here helps you to relax? It doesn't help me to relax, but it's certainly fun. Because I have to pretend that I'm sick. Otherwise, they will kick me out. Mikage was mad at me because I didn't tell her. Mikage, I was afraid you'd get the wrong idea. I was afraid you'd think you were cooking for a crazy person. I've been called strange myself before. And told that I'm staying with a man I'm not in a relationship with. But I had plenty of fun living with you two. That makes me feel better. And now, just like Yuichi, I want to find my Mikage. I feel like I won't find a good partner if I don't expand my circle of friends. Circle of friends, huh? That's why I want to organize a party in this hospital. Eriko, shall we go to the planetarium tonight? Really? I'd be happy to! This doctor made a planetarium by asking permission to the director. It's amazing, right? He knows everything about stars. Eriko, aren't you tired after exercising just now? I'd be very exhausted. Although, I wouldn't want to exercise in the first place. So, Mikage and Yuichi, that's why... I'm waiting for the night to come and for the stars to come out. When that happens, I will take the patients to the yard. I feel like our conversation is going well. It's going so well, it makes me want to miss my daytime counseling. This is a good place to be a doctor, right? Eriko, it's almost dinner time. And, after that, we will go to the planetarium. Everyone will be pleased. Mikage, thanks for visiting me together with Yuichi today. The fact that you came to see me will be good for both of you as well. Spend more time together and be nice to each other. I know that you're both good kids. I'm looking forward to see you two grow up. Meanwhile, I'll stay here and soak up the atmosphere. Goodbye. See you later! Don't forget to say that we both cooked. Of course. - I followed every step. - I'm sure you did it right. - I'll be back soon. - Take it easy, okay? Bye bye! Hello. I know you're working hard. My roommate Tamie and me made dinner for you. I'm sure it's delicious. Can't wait to see you again. Mikage. Tamie, do you mind if I spend the night elsewhere tomorrow? It's Yuichi's birthday, right? I don't mind. - What are you going to cook? - Maybe a feast of Chinese delicacies. Or maybe a full-course meal from the Tour D'Argent restaurant? That's too much for one person to cook. We should mobilize everyone from the cooking class. - Shall we ask them, then? - But you want to be alone with him... Hello. Erm, it's Tanabe speaking. Ah, yes. Hello. Hello? I got big tips today. That's great! I want you to stay with me longer for my birthday tomorrow. How much longer? Let's see... how about you stay the night? The guy with the moon phase watch said that there's a connection between the shape of the moon and man's fortune. For example, when the moon is full, you feel energetic. And during the new moon, you might feel tired. Also, during the full moon, you have a craving for oyakodon. While, during the new moon, you might want to eat French food. I wonder why was I born on this day? What shape was the moon that day? When you think about it, all things happened accidentally start to appear to be predetermined. Including the fact that I'm spending my 23rd birthday with you. I've only been alive for 22 years. It's incredible. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Mikage, I'm very glad that we get to spend this day together. Now, this in front of you is my birthday present. My cooking has become much better. Enjoy. You're more confident now. Let me try. Thank you for the meal. Mikage, if it wasn't for your food, I'd start drinking again. I never thought that food can bring so much joy. I'm very happy today. I didn't feel like eating new food before. It was nice to eat with you and Eriko, the three of us. But it's fun when it's just the both of us. There was a distance between us because of Eriko. It's because of that distance that I... The distance is what made you special to me. You're a very special person to me, Yuichi. I'm really sorry that girl was harassing you. - That person... - Stop. On your birthday, there should only be Mikage Sakurai with you. That's the way things are. And I'm happy this way. I don't care about anything else. I don't want this day to end. I wish this night would last forever. Mikage, move back here. Well, I wouldn't mind that, but... Miss Eriko isn't here now. And if I were to live with you... Would I be your girlfriend? Or your friend? Should I buy us a double bed? Happy birthday, Yuichi! She wanted me to discharge her for your birthday. So, that's what I did. Mikage, what have you cooked? - Have you already had dinner? - Unfortunately, yes. We went to a restaurant on the way here. - We had katsudon. - It tasted salty-sweet. - All right, give me the present! - Here. It's a book about stars. Oh, thanks. This is the sound of a grown-up man. Mikage, Yuichi... Are we unwanted today? Looks like we are on their way. - Aren't you glad, Eriko? - That's right, I'm really happy. Finally, Mikage and Yuichi looked at me as someone who doesn't belong. I couldn't be happier. It's such a weight off my shoulders. - Miss Eriko, that's not it... - It's all right. If you feel constrained, and have the urge to shield yourself from the outer world, that means your soul is on the right track. In other words, you don't have to be admitted to a hospital. I got discharged. My mind feels new. By the way, the doctor resigned yesterday. He will work in the planetarium of the science museum instead. From tomorrow on, he's moving in here. A double bed will be delivered tomorrow. - We will do our best. - We will do our best. - Sorry to keep you. - It's no problem. Sakurai, to tell you the truth, I'm planning to go to Europe for six months. I haven't told about this to anyone yet. I will make a TV program about a Michelin star restaurant. Of course, it's going to be a valuable experience for me. But it would be even more valuable for you. Would you like to be my assistant, and come with me? Thank you for the invitation. I'm happy you thought about me. I understand, it's not easy to leave for six months. Take a few days to think, and let me know. But first promise you will not tell anyone about this matter. See you. The Cassiopeia constellation is shaped like a W, and was named after the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia. The Cepheus constellation is next to Cassiopeia. It's shaped like a house. It's hard to spot unless stars are bright. Between Cepheus and Cassiopeia, there is their beautiful daughter. This is the well-known Andromeda constellation. It seems like a good proposal. It is indeed a good proposal. For six months? How is it going between Miss Eriko and the doctor? They're still learning about each other. People are so different. There will always be a source of new scripts for soap operas. - Yuichi... - Yes? Have you ever thought about living alone? Living alone, you say? We could live together, if you want. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don't miss it. When else are you going to go to Europe, Mikage? Don't you think being with you is a bigger opportunity, Yuichi? Mikage, don't mind about me. Think about your future. Think about how to improve. You have done that before. People change. Yuichi, tell me the truth. Would you feel lonely without me if I went to Europe for six months? Don't you need me by your side? I do. I won't go to Europe, then. I'll stay by your side, Yuichi. It will be better for me, too. I want you to feel like a woman. Everything is expensive here. Young people don't have such money. Aren't these pretty? I'm giving them all to you. And this, too, Mikage. - I'm giving them all, okay? - Thank you. Hold this for me. It will look good on you, too. Here you go. This one has a pretty color, so it's yours! - Thank you so much. - No need to. Good luck. Take good care of Eriko, please. I will. Well then, let me give you both some kitchen utensils. Otherwise, you'll have to buy a lot. Mikage, what would you like to take? What about you, Yuichi? Hand me the other bag. Ah, all right. And now it's time to say goodbye. I have nothing else to give you, so take this. The moon phase watch. Are you sure? Yuichi... Mikage... Don't forget to visit us sometimes. Is it okay if we also do that? Hey, Mikage... In case you are thirsty when you wake up, I put the water of life within reach. You know, after my grandma died and I felt lonely, I had a hard time sleeping. I tried to stay away from her room. Then, I found that I slept best in the kitchen, next to the fridge. When I slept there, I felt pleasantly refreshed. Like I was becoming one with myself and the world. I felt as if I was about to start floating. Directed by: Yoshimitsu Morita
