From the Northern Tier in upstate New York, you're listening to the sounds from Midnight Jazz. And now, it's the hour to settle in to our late night block. Can I help you? Lookin' for Mark Walker. That's me. I heard a couple of soldiers on base talkin' about this place. They say you help soldiers get out. I'm a lawyer, I try to make a case to their legal discharge. Like Specialist Tanaka? You know Mike? Yep, met him a few times. Yeah, I'm the one that handling his case. I'm a vet. Vietnam? Yes. Then you know about going to Canada. Why don't you have a seat then and tell me your name. No, I'm not sure I wanna tell you my name. Well, then it's gonna be hard for me to help. You behind this? Yes, I'm one of the people organizing. Corporal Darien Cooper, 10th Mountain Battalion. My next deployment will be my third. Have you received your orders yet? Not yet but it'll be soon. I have a wife and child to think about. Then let us get you an appointment, and if you wanna bring your wife, your family, that's fine. I get a four day pass next week. Can I call you in a few days? Of course. I need you to do the laundry. They called me in for an emergency faculty meeting. Are your clothes in the basket? Yes, and I left some money on the table next to your lunch. It has been confirmed that personnel of the United States Army committed a series of human rights violations against detainees in Iraq but it's not just overseas, here's Dee Santos with an alarming update. Two soldiers on the base have been accused by another soldier of raping an Iraqi woman and her mother during a dawn raid in the suburbs of Baghdad. The Bush Administration has been under attack lately for letting the Army recruit soldiers with criminal records. This is Dee Santos reporting for channel one. Yeah, okay. Walker. How you doing Captain? It's a morning, like any other. Coffee? Sure. See those guys out there? Hard to miss. All of 'em, they've been picked up by the local cops for drunk driving, all of them. Are they getting evaluated for PTSD? Of course. A Captain in here yesterday, back from Iraq, he had crashed his motorcycle at the town dump and blew up the transfer station. He'd just bought the motorcycle the day before, he'd never even driven one before. Can't say why. Impulsive he said. And so why is it so hard for me to get your help? If I get too successful trying these cases the Army will just put me on the other side, they'll make me a prosecutor. That's not a pleasant arm. What can I do for you Mr. Walker? Some of my associates aren't getting night passes. How many soldiers are we talking about? Mm, I don't know, 10, maybe 20. Well the General knows all about your place, and your history. Call me, please. I'd like to hear more about the instant with your staff sergeant. You went to him soon after you started having problems performing your duties. Yes, I, after Robby my best buddy got killed, I couldn't sleep and I was feeling really low, you know? So I went to Staff Sergeant Connolly, I was worried I was gonna mess up, put me or somebody else in danger. Then what happened? Well, he didn't really say much but the next time I was with the guys in my unit he... Go on specialist. He got behind me and pretended, you know, I was a girl and he was doing me. And he told the other guys I was acting like a pussy and this is what you do to pussies. How did it go? All right I guess. I gotta get outta here. Excuse me, Major, I'm Mark Walker. Mike Tanaka's attorney. I know who you are. I have Dr. Mennard here who's come all the way from Texas. We have his written report. Okay, that report was submitted six months ago. I think that the Doctor has additional information. I think it would be in everybody's best interest if he testified. My client has been treated very badly and I intend to pursue this case if he doesn't get a fair hearing. They asked me things all the way back to my fucking childhood. When will I know? Oh, the report will probably come out eight or 10 weeks. Thanks again for coming all the way out doctor. Of course. Call you as soon as I hear anything. He''ll be in real trouble, if they take away his benefits. Yeah, we'll make appeals at every step of the way. He was AWOL for a year. You convince him. Fighting in a war and all the bullshit that happened to him over there it's not enough. The key is, proving that Mike had a prior condition, and they call this a sanity here. We were in the same platoon, he hung himself in 1981. They remind me to keep working. Hello? Oh, yes, that's me. Is your granddaughter in the army? Okay, come and see me in Watertown as soon as possible, But won't they arrest her? I can't let her go through that. I need to go. Thank you for your help. Sh, sh, sh, do you wanna say hi to Daddy? Hey, how's my little guy today? So I was thinking maybe we can all go out and do something today off the base. Sorry babe, I got stuff to do. What stuff? Christ, Maria, what? Do I have to explain myself to you now? This happens to be my job you know? What's going on with you? What happened? They assigned me to march in the Columbus Day parade, it's such a fucking joke. And have you called the lawyer back? Shh, no, I have to schedule another meeting in person. I think you should. Maybe he can help us. I love you. I love you. Jesus Christ! Get dressed. We have an appointment in Watertown later this afternoon. An appointment, what are you talking about? You can't hide out here forever. We're gonna go see a lawyer. Its okay. Its all right. Hey, its okay. Sh, sh, sh. I'm not going to lie to you. This is not a short, easy process, but it begins with you turning yourself in. They're gonna put me on the first plane back. I can guarantee you hearing, but I can't promise you the outcome. So can you tell me why you didn't report to duty? Come on honey, you were different after the second tour, she stays in bed most days, she'd still be there now, if I didn't make her come with me. I'll need a psychiatric evaluation if we're going to pursue a legal discharge. So they won't punish her for deserting? Right now, Cori is classified AWOL. I wanna keep it that way. So then what am I hoping for? For now, a way out of hiding. Are they gonna say my granddaughter's crazy? Because it's the war that's crazy. I already talked to the army psychs. I did a tour in Vietnam. You were drafted? You know what I was doing when I signed up? Army gave me a purpose. I can't tell you what to do, but if you're going to work together, I need this to move forward. You don't have to do this. Just get it over with. I signed up to pay for college. They trained me to drive in the support convoys. I didn't see too much combat. You saw combat? I was a gunner in a Humvee a couple of times and the army called it, combat support. That's what they called it. That's how they got around the regulations when they ran out of men. Did that make you angry? No, I was as good as the men. I liked the responsibility. Do you like working under your superiors? In the military you don't have much of a choice. You do what they tell you. It just that it can be an issue, especially for women. Yeah, tell me about it. What do you mean by that? I had some problems with my staff sergeant. Can you elaborate? He used to say shit to me and I just ignored him. But, he started touching me, grabbing my butt, shit like that. I told my CO and he said that there were more important things to worry about. And in a fucked up way, I agreed with him. We were in combat. People were- - Nevertheless, what he did was a crime. The CO or the asshole? Both. I woke up one morning and he was standing right in my face, with his fucking dick out. And that's when I fucking went nuts. I would start screaming, I went crazy. I went back to my fucking CO and he said he would do something about it. And a few weeks later, the motherfucker, was promoted to unit commander somewhere fucking else. I have to ask you this, do you ever have suicidal thoughts? But I can't sleep. You know what never sleeping feels like? I don't know why we're doing this, we're never gonna use these fucking things. Hey, we've got that Appleby. We as his way, we probably will. Heads up boys we jumping into Baghdad. Fucking Appleby only cares about himself those maneuvers were made around Fallujah were bullshit. Hey, we're on patrol, man. Why you always ragging on Appleby anyway? Because we shouldn't have been in the streets without backup. He just wanted his units get combat time. So we'll he can earn his fucking medal. That's bullshit. Hey guys were home. Remember we aint fighting no Haji's anymore. Shut up. Look, he put our unit in danger. He didn't give a fuck about us. Yeah, you've been complaining ever since we got back, we were on a mission. One of which I was proud as hell to be a part of- - What's that gotta do with Appleby? He almost got us killed so he could shake hands with the president. Hey, will you guys chill out? Yeah again, I'll fuck you up. Are you're gonna beat the shit out of me? Yeah, I'd like to see you try. We have a little of Hey, what the- - Guys. All right that's enough. Hey, hey stop. Stop it you stupid fucks. If anybody sees this we'll be digging holes for weeks. Oh, God. Fuck man, you really clipped me. Yeah, you damn right I did. Yeah, well, I'm glad we were able to discuss this like men. What are you laughing at? Give me a heart attack. Crazy mother fuckers. Hey, what's going on? Nothing man, just get the shit done. Evaluation should be back in a few days, and you're welcome to take a look before making any final decisions. But if you decide to give yourself up, I need to schedule a press conference. Why, we didn't talk about that? The army is lying about how many soldiers are coming back with problems. Yeah but, I'm a nobody. And they don't want me to speak out. If you stay silent, nothing changes. I looked you up online, said you were radical. Recently, or when I was really one? Nobody pays too much attention to what I do any day now. My mom was always going to meetings and protests when she was clean. I remember she took me all the way to Washington once when I was 10 to some abortion rally. That's when we lived in Detroit. I'm from Battle Creek. No way. My dad worked at the Kellogg factory, graduated from Wayne State. Wayne State, that's crazy. I almost went there. I joined up instead. Would you go back? No one left to go back to. Where is she now? Your mom. She cut out four years before I left. Even Roberta doesn't know where she is. It's really beautiful up here. Spent most of my high school years up in Syracuse. I didn't even know a place like this existed upstate. Just never thought I'd be in this situation. Cooper? Hey, I thought that was you. Yo, shit man. How you doing? Wrestler? Oh, yeah, it's Jake these days. Man, I can't believe it. You, um, you know, like. No, I'm just on leave. Well you're not allowed to be here. Yeah, I know. Listen, I gotta go inside, drop something off. Um, do you, I dunno, you wanna like hang out afterwards, get a beer. Yeah. Great, awesome. Meet me out here in ten, all right? All right. All right. You need some people to drive ahead in cars. You just can't walk from Ithaca to Watertown. I have to go, thank you. Christian, man, I'm glad that you can make it. Man, I know it's been a lot of trouble getting passes off the base and everything. No word on my petition then? No, I'm sorry. I'm here. Christian, this is Dee Santos, News One. All right, lets go up on here. The protesters are coming in from Buffalo, Elmira, Ithaca and Rochester. So what I was hoping is that we get some coverage of them on the road. How many people are we talking about? 500 maybe. That's all? This is 2008, not 1968. Okay, if I could get information on the protester, s I can get you some stuff. Alright. Look what the cat dragged in. Nathaniel. Hey Mr. New York lawyer, If I'm a New York lawyer, what the hell am I doing up here? Yeah. What the fuck are you doing up here? Just doing my duty, baby. Christian would you give this to Dee. So Mr. Wise cop, where the fuck have you been? You're my main field organizer. I know, I had my cell off for a few days. I had a bad weekend. I put up messages for you. Anything happened? I'm off the meds. I've been working up to it for awhile. I'm impressed. How you feeling? Less tired? And, I can get a hard on again. At my age you need pills for that too. All right baby come on. There's a lady who wants to see you. He was upset about something this morning, but he wouldn't tell me why. And then I went in this morning and saw he took a four day pass. He asked about Canada. Well I discouraged everyone from going that route it's not the same situation as it was during Vietnam. NATO regulations require that everyone honors the extradition treaty. What does that mean? There's no coming back legally. He would never, this is not like him. He believes strongly in serving his country. He's done two tours. He's not the man that I married. No I wonder, yeah, what happened Yeah, I was in a hospital in San Diego, nearly lost my leg from where the IED hit me, and those motherfuckers, they want to send me back, said I was fine, you know? No way I was going the fuck back there. So, you know I saw this thing, right. About the soldier that wanted to change his status to a conscientious objector. They wouldn't let him, he had a fucking family and everything. So, you know, he took off, came up here. The one with the court case. Yeah. He's trying to figure out what to do, he gotta a kid now, you know? Yeah, I remember that. You had a boy, right? Yeah. You do know we're no better than goddamn immigrants up here, right? Like, people are nice, but work-wise, we're no better off than like the Africans or the Mexicans. Jobs I'm talking about, it's shoveling snow, washing dishes. I just wanna disappear. Wanna take my family and- - There's no way out like that, man. This world has gotten way too, like, there's no place left to hide, you know.

I said, I don't know. I might just go back. To where? You wanna go back to Iraq? You do know why we're fighting over there, right? It's to secure oil rights for fucking Exxon. I don't give a shit about that, man. They can divide up the treasure however they want. I just wannt this last tour and get the fuck out of there. Oh, please, that's such a fucking cop out. And what you did isn't? We both took an oath, man. Fuck you, man! I thought the reason why you came out here was because you were against the war. You know, the way I see it, army eats everybody fucking up. Good, bad, you're just not ready to see that. Maybe you should talk to another lawyer. What other lawyer? He's vet. He knows about this kind of stuff. And I trust him. Hi Walker, it's Maria. Just wanted to let that Darien is back, thank God. And he's safe. Everything's back to normal. Just wanted to give you the heads up, okay? Thank you again for seeing me. Bye. Who was that? Wait, I thought you were asleep, you scared me. Who were you talking to on the phone? I left a message for that lawyer Walker. I went to see him when I didn't know where you were. Why? I didn't... I was scared, maybe I thought he would know something. I just went out there to check things out. And what'd you think I was gonna do? I'm not that fucked up. Baby, baby, look at me. I would go wherever you want me to go, right? Do you really wanna run away? My orders could come through any day. So why don't you call Walker, maybe he could help you. No, after this shit I've been through, I'm not leaving with dishonorable discharge. Dishonorable discharge? What makes you think that that's gonna happen? Well, I'm not taking a fucking chance, Maria, all right? Okay. Hey, hey? Hey, I'm talking. Don't you fucking walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Darien? Darien, Darien! Relax, relax, relax Baby, its okay. Mama's here son. It's okay, it's okay. Hi. Are you here to see Walker? Yeah. I don't think there's anyone in there. You have an appointment? Yeah, 3:00 PM. You in the service too? Where you stationed? Camp Luka in Avijan. Generator city. Never got there. You didn't miss much. I'm Darien Cooper. Nice to meet you. Cori. Wanna try the door. Yeah. Walker? You here? Walker? Oh, shit, call 911. Its okay. No hospitals. I'll go get some water. I don't know how fucking long I've been in this bathroom. What happened? I'm not sure, blacked out. We should call a doctor. No, no, no. Give me a hand, okay. Ready? Yeah. Three, two, one. On the couch? Oh, yeah. Okay. I got it here. I'm sorry. What time is it? A little after three. I can come back later. Maybe it's best. This is not good for both of you to be here together here. What difference does it make? I'm gonna be out tomorrow anyways. I've been AWOL for six months. Walker's scheduled a press conference here tomorrow nights. And after I'm giving myself up. Why? So that people could know what happened to her. No, no, no, I get that. I mean, why'd you leave? I don't know, just lay in bed. Miss my flight out. I knew how serious it was. Yeah, I should probably go, like you said. Can you come back later and we don't have a lot of time to block you with deployment. Army thinks I'm perfectly fit to go back. Maybe I am. But you know that doesn't mean anything. They sending everybody back. Good luck tomorrow. Thanks. How are you feeling? Better. Ooh, yeah. You don't have to say anything you don't want to tomorrow. What do you mean? The psychiatrist she said, wrote in her report that she has some issue with your staff sergeant. Yeah, they definitely don't pay for that shit in basic. Did she see him again? Yeah, he was around, I need some air. Be careful, this is an army town and you don't wanna be picked up. Dirty fucking habit. You done already? I need to walk. There's a lake about half a mile that way. There won't be anybody there this time of day. Thanks. You should go on in. I really wanna thank you for coming out tonight to offer your support for specialist Cori Gibson. Come on. Who up into six months ago was in Iraq with the 414th Transportation Company. Specialist Gibson was ordered back to Iraq for a third tour, suffering from PTSD. She went AWOL. To stop that by now? Plus she's gonna turn herself in tomorrow morning- - I understand you orders- - For Drummer, in order to pursue her case for a legal discharge. Specialist Gibson. You're interrupting, sir. We have orders to take Specialists Gibson back to base. Go back, well continue this right here. Miss Gibson's gonna turn herself in tomorrow morning. The judge advocate is familiar with this situation- - I don't know anything about that sir, we have orders to take Specialist Gibson back to base. Christian, get Layton on the phone for me, please. Sir, you can do whatever you want, but I will have to call the civilian police if you try to interfere. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go with them. I don't understand. We'll figure this out when I get to the judge. Cori? Oh my. Cori, Cori? Cori, is there anything you wanna say? Cori? Come in tighter. I'll be at the base first thing in the morning to figure out what happened, okay? We trusted you. Mr. Walker, do you have anything to say? Any comment? Now, I see you had an exemplary record. What went wrong when you came home? I just couldn't go back sir. That's obvious, but we'd like to know why. Have you always been a quitter? Let her answer captain? I don't know how to explain it. I just couldn't go back. This is a fucking waste of time. Watch the language. Women like you give all of us a bad name. Did you get along with your fellow officers in the unit? For the most part sir, yes. What do you mean for the most part? I had some trouble with my staff sergeant and my commanding officer, sir. What kind of trouble? I didn't agree with the way that they handled some things, sir. That's too bad, but it's not your place to challenge your superior officer. I know, I know that captain. So what was the problem? Nothing captain. How did you feel when your unit went back without you? I wish none of us had to go back, sir. He's asking if you felt guilty about abandoning your fellow soldiers. I'm concerned that you're not telling us everything. I'm not sure what you want me to say, sir. Just the truth specialist. I have sir. Then you are a coward. You're signed up for this job and you should finish what you started. What Captain Rodriguez is saying is the army will not punish you for going AWOL. If you decide to rejoin your unit. Where's Walker? Where's my lawyer? Where is she? Someone should be bringing her over. What the hell happened last night? How did they know about the press conference? It wasn't exactly a secret. Good morning, Captain Leighton. Captain, I thought you'd be bringing Specialist Gibson. No captain, General Peels just told me to be at your office at eight. My client is under extraordinary duress. She is depressed and possibly suicidal. Captain Hall checking with the mental health clinic. I want to call the MP headquarters. She's got to be somewhere on this base. Morning, Major Hazleton. Good morning, captain. We're trying to locate a soldier Specialist Gibson who was arrested off base last night. The AWOL soldier. Yes, we were told she was taken to your unit. She was assigned to mine when she got back from Iraq. We know that. Where is she now? You're the lawyer I saw on the news last night. I am Specialist Gibson's attorney, yes. You think you're giving her good advice? Major Hazleton. Can you tell us where Specialist's Gibson is now? I tell my soldiers to stay away from that coffee shop you running in town. Did something happen to my client? She was acting mentally incoherent by the end of the interview. So I had her taken to the local hospital. I should have been notified. I did her a favor. She was facing a court martial. I fucking can't believe this shit. Don't act like you're not using her for your own cause. Can I help you, sir? Can I help you, sir? I'm Specialist's Gibson's attorney. I just came from the base. What's going on here? All the beds in the psychiatric ward are full. We're waiting to hear if the specialist will be sent to General or Walter Reed. Walter Reed? Whose orders are you waiting for? Get them on the phone right now. You all right? He didn't hit you, did he? No, no, it's just stupid questions and accusations. I'm a quitter, shit like that. What the hell happened Walker? I'm sorry. This has never happened before. Why me? Did you piss somebody off? I have Captain Marcus on the line. You want anything? Food, coffee? Coffee. Carlisle, go down to the cafeteria and get Specialist Gibson coffee. Hello Captain Marcus. I just want some information. My client came here simply for an examination and you're talking about sending them to a psychiatric ward, please don't tell me to be calm. Captain Marcus wants to speak to you. Yes Captain Marcus sir. Yes sir, yes, yes sir. - Dr. - Peter Dr. Peter Oh. - Yes! - Woo hah! - Yes. - Yay. That was actually great. Now you dig, you made it. Look you won, I let you win though. Yeah right. You all right babe? Yeah, why wouldn't I be? I'm gonna use the restroom. Hey, I want that rematch when you get back. Lucky you guys date. I aint supposed to say anything yet, but Carmen's pregnant. It's the reason she ain't here tonight. Yes. Yes. That's great, man. Congrats, I guess you weren't shooting blanks after all, right? Thank you bro. Thank you, I appreciate that. I'm excited, man. I really am, but I'm kind of freaked out, you know? We're going back soon and I probably won't be here when the baby's born. We can't think about that. You right, you right? Is that what you do? Well, you shouldn't come to me for advice. What are you talking about bro? You the one who's always bringing morale over there. The guys look up to you and shit. Yeah it's fucking bullshit, man. I'm nobody's hero. Oh, okay. Man what's up? I almost hit Maria a few days ago. Damn. Yeah, and I feel like I'm losing it. What do you need De? Talk to me? No, I'm good. Just gonna finish what we started, right? That's right bro. Hey, you get home before you know it. Home before we know it. I'm scared for her, hey? Her grandmother get back in touch? No she's spurious of me. So is Cori, wherever she is. You know, you can't force these soldiers to become political. All you can do is help the ones who want a way out. Oh, I should be an environmental movement, Tim, that's where all the young activists are. They see hope there. What about you then? Ever since I got back, I don't think about hope. I used to. Why do you still do it then? Resistance is all I have left. Sorry to leave you like this, but we do have a demonstration to pull off. We've got to keep our eyes on the prize, huh? Just turn on your goddamn phone, okay? Well first you should learn how to text. I'm scared. I am too. Anything? No, I did all over town nobody's seen or heard from her, including her grandmother. That's not good. There's a lot that's bad about this situation. Why'd you let her get away at the hospital? I took my eyes off her for a second. The MP's were in charge. Yeah, well, trust me. They're in plenty of trouble. Peels is furious. I don't give a shit about Peels. Well, you should. He's looking for somebody to blame. He should go after Hazleton. I fucking wanted to kill that guy. I know, I did too. He had no authority to send her to the hospital. The news got down to the Pentagon, Peels flew to Arlington last night. Hazleton I'll take the brunt of it, but he's also going after you and the Drummer. It's Cori Gibson, who I'm worried about, okay? You should be a little more worried about yourself. I've been in more difficult situations than this. Peels is going to be back in town for the parade in two days, make them look real good if Specialist Gibson was there. She was turning herself in remember. Until you tipped Peels off about the press conference. That's quite an accusation. Who else knew? What we had agreed to? Why would he have her arrested? She's turning herself in the next day. To set an example for the rest of the unit. So you knew that they were going to stop the press conference. I was only doing my job. I hope the army treats you well for your loyalty. You got until after the parade to find her. After that, I can't help you. Good luck. That shit took so long man, I felt like I was on tour. Sir, I'm first Lieutenant Nathaniel Marsh and I served with the 10th Mountain division in Iraq. Yes, Lieutenant. I wanna know what you and the army are doing about the many soldiers who are coming back from Iraq, suffering post traumatic stress disorder. I don't think this is the appropriate time to discuss this issue Lieutenant. With all due respect, sir. When is the appropriate time? I'd be glad to meet with the committee of soldiers anytime. Could we have a date and time now, sir? Americans have always had the right to demonstrate in this country and soldiers are no exception, but the army isn't going anywhere. And there are plenty of people in America who are happy about that. Sir, with all due respect, I'm talking about soldiers who served our country and are coming home with severe mental- - Just contact my office Lieutenant- - Yeah, we've done that sir, numerous times. We want the truth. We want the truth. We want the truth. We want the truth. We want the truth. We want the truth. We want the truth. I'm out. What? My CO said I'm getting my discharge papers on Monday. Congratulations, man. That's fucking amazing news. Well, it's about time. It's been four months since we filed your petition. What's the discharge? I wouldn't know until I get the papers, but I don't care. If it's dishonorable, we're gonna have to file a petition. Go ahead, they can do what they want. Hey I'll meet you at the food line. Yeah you know what, Christian gone, that means there's no active IVAW member left on base. Yeah, that's probably why they let him go. Hey, I'll catch up with you in a little bit, okay. Eileen, hey what's going on sugar? God How'd did you make it on time? We were up on the hill during the parade. We made it just in time. Oh, that's good, God. How was the walk, huh? Oh, just the same as the other day, we got the finger a few times. Oh, buddy, Some people came out of their homes, to give us sandwiches and coffee. That's nice. Hey, I heard we had that little story in the New York Times. It's nice, but they told me they weren't gonna to cover illustration though. That's the way it is done. Oh, we need you. All we got now is a bunch of ancient Catholic pacifists and old Jewish leftists. Who all wish they were Buddhists. Well what's wrong with that? Because it's the same God damn people who protested Vietnam. That's what's wrong with it. Yo Cooper, what are you doing here? I'm looking for Mark Walker. He said he'd be here, have you seen him? Yeah, he'll be back in a sec. Darien Cooper this is Nate Marsh. Nate got out two years ago. When's your next deployment? Soon. Well, feel free to grab some food. Nah, I'm good. So what's your plan now, huh? Now that you're free. Shit, If I know. Maybe we can all get a place, you know, something like that, you know, an abandoned farm. You mean, I'd have to live with you. I was in a fucking five ton with you for 12 months. And I'm serious. Communities like this. They're sprouting up all over the place. I dunno, man, I can't think that far ahead. What about you Darien? What about me? You got a plan for when you get out? Well I'm not moving my family to a fucking hippy commune, if that's what you mean? No offense. Shit, dude. That was definite. Look, I got you. I used to live in my van with my girl. That was not good. Yeah, she told me all about it. It's important that we all stick together, because most people they don't understand. Understand what? Us, what we went through. Let's all take a very deep breath. It's been a long march, and most of us have made it to the end. And now I think it's time to share with each other. I'm currently stationed at Fort Little Drum. As a member of Iraq, Veterans Against the War. I want you all to know that we really appreciate you being out here and doing all of this. There are not many of us on the base. Seeing this march really helps us to keep moving forward. This is the beginning. ♪ This is the beginning. ♪ Walker, what the hell happened? Every God damn demonstration I ever been on. Someone always stands up and says, "it's just the beginning." This is the beginning. You know how many times I've heard that? ♪ We shall overcome ♪ ♪ We shall overcome some day ♪ Shit! My orders came through, they're sending me back next week. That meant I should followed your paperwork already. It's too late. Darien, is there something we can do? I got to go. I stayed too long. Do you need a ride? Yeah, yeah, yeah, then we can talk. Let us talk about, me and Luca Gibson army-aided up right up. Turn off your lights asshole? What the fuck? What was that? What happened? You all right? Yeah. Walker, are you all right? Uh huh, yeah. Fuck. I'll go see what it is. Its a fucking deer. I don't wanna kill anybody anymore. Then don't go. You're in no shape to go back. I already told you it's too late. I don't care. I'm not going back. If they catch you, they'll just send you home. You know that. I can't go back to base, not after the way they treated me them telling me that I betrayed my friends and that bitch calling me a coward! You don't know fucking shit that they did to me. I don't fucking care. We are standing outside the U.S. army base. At Fort Little Drum in upstate New York, where it has been confirmed that a 27 year old soldier, Darien Cooper has shot his wife and then himself at one of the base housing complexes. Cooper was about to be deployed back to Iraq for his third tour of duty, a statement from General Stanton Peels is expected shortly. I'm really starting to worry about Walker. It's okay man, he's probably just driving around. Nate. Walker? Who's there? It's me, it's Cori, Cori Gibson. I wasn't sure I'll ever see you again. I heard about what happened on the news. He said I'll meet you up. You had no idea? No, I really didn't know him that well. I just can't even believe he would do that. I was worried about you. You all right? I don't know, I don't know. I pushed you too far. I'm sorry. Landlord said to just drop the keys off on our way out. You tried. You did good work here. For a while. You headed back to New York? We're still waiting on the decision on her case. I'm not leaving until we know. Blame it on me. Sorry, I saw you across the street. I always wondered what this place was. It was a place for soldiers to hang out. I'm gonna sign up at the end of the semester. I wanna serve like you. I can see that.
