Wrong. Sorry. Turn left, turn left. Ok, good. Now go straight. There you go. Go straight, there. Why do I feel like I'm coaching this thing through foreplay? Nuh-uh. Sorry. That's enough for you today, Dr. Mengele. What's going on here? Gabriel took the zapper. Get on with the experiment, Mr. Higgs. Why can't we give them a chance to do it on their own? Because... that's not the experiment. Now hit the button. What about positive reinforcement? You said B.F. Skinner used rewards to, uh... I know what I said. That was last week's lesson. This week, we shock them. Go ahead. He'll hardly feel a thing. No. You have a lot to learn about being a doctor, Mr. Higgs. well, I live on the edge where it's a little run-down you should come visit me next time you're in town I'm the next James Dean... There he is, Maggie! Mom! Dad! What are you doing here? Your father wanted to surprise you. Don't you realize the medical admissions test is tomorrow? That is precisely why we're here, son. A-ha. A-ha, very good. Very good. Gabe's application to Johns Hopkins. Please, Dad, I was working on that. Gabriel... this can't wait. For over a hundred years, we Higgs have preserved a tradition. What are you doing to that plant? Removing the dead leaves. It stimulates a growth hormone. Gabriel... stop fidgeting with the plant. Go on, dear. Son... the time has come for you to follow in your ancestors' footsteps. Margaret. The tassel. Your great-great-grandfather Ezekiel wore this tassel when he graduated with the very first class from Johns Hopkins Medical School. My grandfather carried it with him through Johns Hopkins and my father and I carried it through Johns Hopkins with us. It's yours now. You will keep the tradition alive. Dad's so proud of you. Do us proud on that exam tomorrow. I got it. The Medical College Admissions Test consists of four parts. It is extremely important that you follow all instructions precisely. Blacken the appropriate ovals and rectangles and erase completely any incorrect or stray marks. You have one minute remaining. Stop. Close your test booklets and your answer sheets and put your pencils down. I said stop! It was a complete disaster! 75 questions down the tubes because of one stupid mistake. Oh, come on Gabe, do you think Johns Hopkins is gonna care about some boondoggle test? It's the admissions test! Higgs, man, your family practically founded the school, all right? - You're in. - Not at this rate. How many times do I have to tell you? You want the beef at the top, you got to stir the stew yourself, buddy. Your whacked-out Dinty Moore philosophy isn't gonna get me into Johns Hopkins! Hey man, don't fry a circuit. All right, flunk boy? It's not my fault you blew the test. Junior Mint? You're right, I'm sorry. So you blew the MCAT. All right, you still got your grades. You still got your interview. Sorry. Take, for example, a battlefield strewn with casualties. You have limited supplies, limited manpower. Triage... One man alone decides who will live and who will die, Holding the staff of Asclepius in his hand, Playing God... if you will. Dr. Peters, medicine is the noblest profession. Thank you, Mr. Grimm. Thank you, sir. Mister... Higgs. Yes! Good luck, sport. Would you hand me that coat, son? Thank you. I see you've studied quite a bit of botany. Botany? Yes! As you know, most drugs are derived from plants. We're not here to discuss shrubbery, Mr. Higgs. Let's get to medicine, shall we? Why did you apply to this medical school? Going to Johns Hopkins is quite a tradition in the Higgs family. In fact, it's the only school I applied to. My great-great-grandfather was in the first graduating class. We know all about your family tradition. Why do you want to attend Johns Hopkins? I... never thought of it apart from at least the, uh... context... of... of the tradition. Um, uh... I suppose, um... Isn't tradition important? shot down dead shot down most of his life shot down and it comes as no surprise shot down, no choice everybody's story, I cried in disbelief won't you please help me see... I got in! I got in! Cornell Med School, here I come! I got in! was not for naught, all in vain Hang in there, Gabe, baby. I'm still trying to crack the Johns Hopkins directory. Don't waste your time, Ron. Doesn't matter where I am on the list. I'm not in. I knew it, man. The bell-z security code! One Johns Hopkins waiting list, coming up! Hey, look! You're number six! That's not so bad. It's all over. I'd have to be number one to stand a chance. Nobody turns down Johns Hopkins. Look who's number four. The elusive woman of your dreams... Kirby Watts. What a co-inky-dinky. It's fate, Gabe. The two of you were destined to meet at some unaccredited med school in Grenada. You don't understand. If I don't go to Johns Hopkins, I'm not going anywhere. Then you're fucked. Hello? Gabey, it's Mother. I was just talking with Mrs. Fielder. You remember the Fielders, the big house on Rosemont. Anyway, I ran into her downtown and she said that Jim just got accepted at Johns Hopkins! What? Now don't tell me anything. We'll leave it all as a big surprise, ok? You know how long your father's been waiting for this day? He's so proud of you. We're all so proud of you. Gabey? You did tell him 7:00? Yes... I told him 7:00. How many times are you gonna ask me the same question? Here he is. Hello, Gabey! Hi. She did tell you... 7:00. I, uh... Yes... Well, what's the prognosis, Doctor? Gabey, what's that on your shoulders? I thought you were going to Bermuda. Well, the conference can wait one more day... for this. Champagne? Please. Margaret. Thanks. Well? Well what? You got the letter. What letter? From Johns Hopkins. What did they say? What did they say? They said, um... well, they... they said that, um... they said that I wasn't accepted. You had me going there. Congratulations, son. Your first semester's tuition. But be sure you get it in by the end of the week. And you'll also find a little something extra. Congratulations... Doctor. Ooh-hoo! You are in deep shit, flunk boy. Maybe I could talk to them. - Who? - The people ahead of me. If they only knew, they might withdraw from the list. I could beg, plead, appeal to their better natures. Gabe, baby, we're talking about med students, all right? They don't have better natures. They're just mean, competitive and greedy, all right? Now, there's an idea. Bribe 'em. Bribe them. Why not? It's illegal, for one thing. I don't see why it would be. Immoral, then. Why? I mean, who gets hurt? This is ridiculous. How would I even find these people? Hello! Gabe, I'm in Johns Hopkins' directory, all right? Voil?. Here's their names, addresses, class schedules, extracurricular bullshit, where they work, everything. I'd never make it. They turn to the list five days after the letters go out. If I'm not number one by then, I'm finished. So you got to hurry. I don't know. Man, just think of it as a business deal, just business. Right. Where would I find the money? How much? 11,000. Oh, man! How much would I offer them? It's like the popcorn. Just depends on the microwave. It's not like I'd be forcing them to accept. I mean, there's really nothing unethical about it. Right? Hey, you don't have to convince me. I say we start close to home. Kirby Watts. I can't believe it's over already. Yeah, yeah. I swear, I don't know how I pick 'em. He thought he was God's gift to women. What... a... joke. Hi. Juice? Cookie? Juice? Ok. He wouldn't know a clitoris from a thesaurus. Kirby, hi. How are you? Gabriel. Gabriel Higgs from Psych. Kirby. How ya doing? Gabe... No! Uh... I don't want to give blood. I just... Don't you worry. This won't hurt a bit. You don't understand. There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Hi, Kirby. I'm Gabe... Hi, Gabriel. Juice? Cookie? I... I guess. Uh... Bye. Bye. She remembers my name. Sir, are you coming or going? Gabriel. Kirby! What are you doing here? You already gave blood. I know you're on the Hop... I feel all right now. Uh, you heard the nurse. You got to stay on I.V. until blood comes back to your brain. It isn't that often the pre-med students come in here and give blood. And never two pints. Yeah? You should come back next week. Then I'll be working in the sperm bank. You work in a sperm bank? Popsicle? No... thanks. Listen, uh, Kirby. I, um... You took the MCAT, didn't you? Yeah. Where are you planning on going next year? I was waitlisted at Hopkins. Ah, same here! Actually, that's, uh... what I came here to discuss with you. Um... Kirby Watts, please report to the ... office. I got to go. Wait! Listen, I want to ask you something. It's important. Um... I was wondering if, um... you might be interested in... How would you feel about... You know what? I'd love to. You would? Mm-hmm. Why don't you pick me up tonight at 7. Tower 606? Oh. Ok. A date? All is not lost, all right? Just fleece her then. But you better hit the next one right away. Rupert Grimm. He's at Princeton. I can't. The psych test is tomorrow morning. Just chill, all right? You leave now and you get back tonight. But when will I study? Gabe, my friend, an "A" in psych ain't gonna get you into Johns Hopkins, ok? This will. Number five, Rupert Grimm. And, um... try not to fall in love with him, too? Good. Thanks, man. This monkey sits... Prick! Invulnerable. A bold and daring thrust. On the contrary. A reckless gambit indicative of the lamentable decline of a once vigorous mind, and now your blameless queen would bare your folly. Are you going to address me or merely stand there breathing down my neck? Me? Oh, um, I'm sorry. I didn't want to interrupt you while you were playing with yourself. I mean, against yourself. Who's winning? You are. You're Rupert Grimm, right? Don't tell me. Johns Hopkins Medical School. At the interview, you were after me. Higgs. Yes, you have quite a memory. You were holding a dead tupidanthus leaf in your left hand. That's amazing. Thank you. So, Mr. Higgs, I take it you didn't come here to discuss strategies of engagement. Actually, I wondered if you've heard from Johns Hopkins yet. Johns Hopkins. Alas, yes. I've been waitlisted. So was I. Really? And you see, um... getting into Johns Hopkins is a matter of life and death for me. And I was wondering, um... if you weren't absolutely set on going there... if there might be some way I could, uh... persuade you to withdraw from the waiting list. You have the list, haven't you? You're number five. I'm number six. Very interesting. Let me see it. This sorry collection of vermin is ahead of me? You know them? I don't have to, they're all the same. Self-interested, selfish, petty. A doctor holds people's lives in his hands. Hopkins idiots have insulted me, and no one insults Rupert... Grimm. You mean, uh... you'll withdraw? Why not? Really? I don't believe it, that's great! Frankly, if you ask me, Johns Hopkins is a little overrated. No, it isn't. Right, when you think about it. So, uh, I guess that's it. I assume you have already asked the others to withdraw. Uh, no, not yet. I'm number five, old sport. You'll have wasted your time, if a spot opens up and number one takes it. New Hampshire? The first one's in New Hampshire. I've got a psych exam tomorrow. And my date! you're taller than me tall but I can still kiss your face you're taller than me tall you're taller than me tall... Hello. You're late. kiss your face... Kirby, listen... Uh... I... I'm really sorry. It's ok. I made other plans. Oh, you did? No, that's great. this is the time of tell and show... Excuse me? I mean, uh, I can't make it, either. I, uh, I... I've got to go, um, uh, to the library. I have to study for the psych... psych test. Oh, but here, I brought you this. Flowers. How original. Actually, this is a, uh, very rare, Uh... uh... A cactus? See, Randall? Lab practical wasn't that hard. You just needed a little help. Let's go watch the bonfire. No. Don't be such an ogre. Randall, what's the matter? Look, Tina, I appreciate you helping me finish the assignment and everything. It was the everything I liked. Yeah, it was fun. I just wasn't really figuring on you... hanging around all the time, you know? What do you mean? Are you... dumping me? Oh, no. Usually, I don't like to use that word, but in this case, it's just so... perfectly apt. Randall Burns? Sounds to me like you got your balls in quite a vise. Exactly. So? I want money. Ok! Ok. Good, good! I'm prepared for that. Uh, how much money would you want? 40? 40? Thousand. 40,000! Keep your voice down. That's crazy. Where am I supposed to get $40,000? That's your problem. No! Wait, wait. I have some money. I'll take it. Hey! Ow! That's $11,000! Oh, in that case... what's today, Tuesday? I'll give you till Friday to give me the other 29,000. What? And if I don't get it by then, I'll call Johns Hopkins and tell them about your little offer. That's blackmail. And this is bribery. I'm dead serious. Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Poor Tina. Won't you be surprised? What happened? Randall dumped me. Randall Burns is such a flaming asshole. Ah! This is ridiculous. I should have never listened to you. What am I supposed to do? Where am I gonna get $29,000, huh? Hello. You've reached the home of Dr. and Mrs. Lionel Higgs, the proud parents of our son Gabriel who just got into Johns Hopkins Medical... Look. Jesus. Where'd you get all this cash? I sold a painting. A fine example of American naturalism. That's what the fence said. The fence? I'm a thief. I've been consorting with known criminals. You outta your mind. Look at all this fuckin' money. Ok. Ok, who's next? Cornell University. Amanda Morel. Nice name. The bitch. It is the only copy on reserve. Amanda... aren't you through with the book yet? No. I'm studying. Amanda Morel? You can't have it. I'm using it. Oh. No. I, um... I need to talk to you. Get lost. I'm here to offer you money. Let's hear it. I'm willing to pay you to withdraw from the Johns Hopkins waiting list. I see. How much? Well... $2,000. Get real. How much did you have in mind? Guess what? Mommy got $15,000 today. She's rich! And she's hungry. Could you please turn down the music, Amanda? I'm trying to study. Could you hold the line, please? Look, if you want to study, go to the library. I'm just gonna turn it down a touch. Yes, I'd like a small pizza... Stupid dog. Don't you dare attack Bubbles. He growled at me. He also shit in my new shoes. So? They look like shit anyway. Now could you be quiet? I'm on the phone. Fuck! I ordered pepperoni, not mushroom. Jody? Jody? I don't feel so good. Could you tell me where I could find Randall Burns? Yeah, this is it. - Thank you. - Sure. And who can forget the time he called us while he was banging Valerie Kresveldt? The man's a legend! I'm looking for Randall Burns. Hey. This guy's here to see Randy. Send him up. Here he is. Try not to sneeze. Get out of here. Get out of here or I'll smash your fucking brains out! Hello, father. You... Don't we look dignified this morning? Almost didn't recognize you without a bottle in your hand. You want a beer or something? No, thank you. What's all this stuff for? Medical school. Medical school? Yeah. That's really something. I can remember thinkin' you was... a little... off. A doctor. Yes, a doctor. I feel like I should give you a present or something. You can give me a promise. A promise? Yes. Promise me that when your whisky-soaked liver finally turns completely fibrous and you lie in a cirrhotic coma hooked up to the latest dialysis machines, that you'll allow me, your son the doctor, to personally pull the plug. I'd like that. Gabriel, this is your father. Did you wait for the beep? Yes, I heard the beep. Gabriel, I'm calling from Bermuda. We need you to drive to the house to let the pool man in today. 3 p.m. sharp. Don't be late. Gabriel? You... sold my painting. Gabriel? Gabriel. Gabriel! That must have been some dream. Yeah. Brought your psych test. Oh. Thanks. You have the Sugar Cubes. But this is R.E.M. Oh, check the R.E.M. case. It's probably on the floor. You know, I... I got the weirdest message uh, this morning. There's a guy who's on the waiting list at Hopkins, And, uh, he got... Oh, no, it's not in there! God. Look on top of the CD player. Uh... Anyway, he's trying to get all the people ahead of him To, uh, to drop off of the, uh, of the list. He's even offering them money. Well, you gonna report this sleazebag or just tell him to go fuck himself? To go fuck himself. I... I guess. Listen, I, um, I have to go to my parents' house. I have to drive to my parents' house to meet the pool man. Do you want to come? I guess we beat the pool man. Wow. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. They all went to Johns Hopkins. It's a family tradition. What happened here? Somebody go to Harvard? No. Oh. You were waitlisted. Your parents must be devastated. I haven't told them. What? My father's head would explode. Wait, you could still get in. What about that creep? What creep? That guy that you told me about that was trying to bribe everybody off the list. Oh, that creep. Right. I mean, think about it. If everybody takes the money from him and you don't, then that'll bump you to the top of the list. Yeah. You don't have to feel guilty about it. It'd be instant karma for that arrogant bastard. Why don't we check out the pool? Um... Kirby, What if you're ahead of me on the list? If it comes to that, you can just have my place. You'd do that for free? I mean, free... I mean... You'd do that for me? I got a scholarship to Cornell. I couldn't afford to go to Hopkins even if I got in. Kirby, you don't know what that means to me. Why don't we... Go swimming? Swimming? Oh! All right. Huh? Ok. Last one in has to go to medical school in Guadalajara! - Surprise! - Surprise! Gabriel. Mother, I... Hi. I'm Kirby Watts. What a nice surprise. Oh. Thank you. Down. Down. Down. Down. Good dog. Gabriel! What in God's name... That painting is irreplaceable. Irreplaceable! If I ever get my hands on the bastard who did this... by God, I'll tear his stinking eyes out of their sockets and grind them into jelly. What a hideous afternoon. What else could possibly go wrong? Your suit! They took your suit! Young man... Young... lady. I haven't finished with you yet. Let's get out of here. I am so sorry. And you and the dog... Kirby... there's something I really need to tell you. Don't say it. Whoa! Gabe, what the... You did take the money from that sleazebag. No! No, no, I didn't. You are the sleazebag. It's not what you think. All right, then what is it? Huh? God, Gabe, you make me sick. I'm gonna call my father right now and tell him the truth. - You are? - Yes. It's the right thing to do. The only thing to do. Atlanta Conference Center. How may I direct your call? Dr. Lionel Higgs, please. Ringing. I feel better already. Dr. Higgs speaking. Shit. Bookbinder... Bookbinder. She's working in the stacks. Great. You said she's a relative? Yes. She's my sister. Valerie Bookbinder? Yeah? I'm Gabriel Higgs. You're on the Johns Hopkins waiting list and I'm prepared to offer you money to drop off. Pay me? Will that be cash or charge? This is a serious offer. Hey, do you mind? Let me see that! If you want a newspaper, you go and you buy your own. Here. Oh, God. Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie Bookbinder, where'd she go? Valerie! Valerie! What are you doing? Through an unusual oversight on my part, I've inadvertently disposed of a volume to which I must yet refer. You mean you threw out a book. Precisely. If you could be so kind as to check the chute for me... I don't think so. I believe it's on the ledge just inside. Valerie! I believe it's right there. But it's way down there. Indeed. And so, my dear, are you. Valerie! Rupert! What a pleasant surprise, old sport. Some nut's been killing all the people on the waiting list! Really? Oh, shit. Why, Higgs, you're a veritable Hercule Poirot. Don't do that. The police will find you. You are the one they're looking for. Me? You're the one seen with each victim moments before the bitter end. You're the one desperate to get into Johns Hopkins at any cost. But I... Oh, God. Precisely. The gods placed you in my path moments after I learned from Johns Hopkins I'd been relegated to the waiting list. You've been a very hard-working pawn in my game. I will... regret having to dispose of you. You're a madman. You're a fuckin' lunatic! How dare you! Pardon me. I'm very sorry. I got carried away. No hard feelings, I trust. I mean, we do still have one more murder to commit. That's right, your own Kirby Watts. I'll kill you first. It would be ill-advised to try. You should've taken my advice, old sport. I'll turn myself in. Pardon me? If I'm in jail, you can't pin it on me. How terribly noble. And clever. But you see, I've already arranged your precious Kirby's demise. I've planned a little surprise for her at the blood storage unit at the clinic. It matters very little what you do. The police, of course, will suspect you. Please stay behind the barricades. Kirby Watts, please. Kirby! Kirby, thank God you're in. It's Gabriel. Kirby? Kirby! No! Macintosh or IBM? Oh, Gabe, baby! Yeah, good news, man! Johns Hopkins just activated the waiting list. Stop talking for a second! Listen, Rupert Grimm is killing everyone. What? He's gonna kill Kirby next. You have to stop him. Listen very carefully, Ron. Here's what you have to do. Uh-huh. Right. You mean, go... out? Hey, Ron, where are you going? Out. Out? Forget about her. Let's find a drive-thru. The blood storage unit! Where's the blood storage unit? There's a bomb! Move! Kirby! Kirby, no! Don't do it! Kirby Watts. Where is she? I'm afraid you're too late. Too late? Oh, my God. She left with the police a few minutes ago. Is she all right? Would you excuse me for a second? Oh, no. You have nothing to worry about, miss. I'll be right in the hall. There'll be another officer downstairs at the entrance to the building all night. Thank God! You're here. Damn right. It's where I should've been the whole time. What happened? Nothing. What the hell's wrong with you? There's nothing wrong with the blood storage unit. You're sure? Positive! I was out there with trees out there. You had me walking under trees! What, are you trying to kill me? He lied to me. He said he was gonna kill her at the clinic. Why would he lie to me? Oh yeah, Gabe. Why'd a murderer lie to you? Because he needed me here, that's why! Now that I'm back, he can kill her! Just relax. Look, the police are with her now. She'll be fine. No, she won't. He'll get through! You don't understand how smart this guy is. He'll be three steps ahead of the police. Damn! Relax. He'll kill her. He'll find a way! Sure. How? He burned the first one, poisoned another. He's crazy! You can't predict. Just need the pages. Burned the first, poisoned the second, impaled the third... Beat it, geek. It's you! You're the Waiting List Killer! Help! Help! Help! Hi. Want to be number 4? Sit down and shut up. Sit! And don't move. Is that clear? God damn, Higgs! If the cops spot me, it's all over. You have to get to Kirby! I can't! It's worse after dark. Nothing's going to happen. Come on! That's it. No! Let me go! This is absurd. Just 'cause somebody jumped out a window and died, for God's sakes. He landed on my tricycle! Pull yourself together! Rupert's going to kill her! Just get into her room. You see that light? That's Kirby's room. Ready? Feeling ok? Wait! He burned Randall Burns! Bookbinder... Bookbinder was impaled. Was impaled in a library. Amanda Morel. Morel? Morel is a kind of mushroom. That's it! The mushroom pizza! Bookbinder in a library, Burns burned... he killed them by their names. Kirby Watts! Shit! Roger. Shit! No. What the... Oh, God. Good evening. You scared me. Who are you? You may call me Dr. Grimm. Dr. Grimm? I, too, am on the ill-fated waiting list. I rushed down here from Princeton seeking refuge in numbers. I feared you may have been dispatched by the unfortunate maniac. But, alas, here you are... alive. We should get Officer Denby... We'll be safer here... together. So, why the tux? What do you mean? Isn't it a little dressy? I like to dress up. Even when rushing to meet me? Maybe I came from a wedding. Maybe you're not who you say you are. Maybe I look good in black. Right. That's a stunning retort, but hardly persuasive. Just like the rest... unable to carry out the weight of professional responsibility, unwilling to make difficult decisions, not ready to face the future. Do you have any defense? I didn't think so. Please. I'll... You'll... you'll what? You'll what? Not quite dead yet? Your struggles only hasten your demise. You've spelled out your fate. By now, the alveoli in your lungs have absorbed the last molecules of oxygen. You'll be experiencing a brief euphoria lasting 30... Damn. Obviously ahead of schedule. Well done, old sport. You figured it out. No! Pity, really. Should've been electrocuted. Don't waste your breath. The little strumpet's undeniably dead. I caught him trying to asphyxiate her. - Stop him! - That's Higgs! Stop him before the unfortunate maniac dispatches the rest of us. No! No! Let me go! Stop it! - Go quietly, old sport. - Kirby! Stop... You'll be better off. Please! Kirby! Kirby! It's tragic, officer. I didn't know what to do. I got a pulse! That isn't a possibility. Couldn't have gone wrong, really. It couldn't. Hold it right there. Come on, now. You shall not have me. The gods are awaiting me. You want stew at the top, you stir the beef... fuck was I talking about? Say farewell to Rupert Grimm. Oh, shit! Shit! You see? It's not paranoia. Shit falls on me. Never gonna try it again. Easy. Easy! Hey, call my mother. Someone call my mother. Kirby. I'm sorry. You can't let us go like this. I won't let you. I thought you were somebody else. My God. This is a nightmare. Yes. It is. After all the plans we had for you. After all we did! And you... You just throw it back in our faces like this? All right. All right. Let's just stop and think. There has to be some way out of this disaster. How? Those people are already dead. Not them, you idiot! Johns Hopkins! After all, I'm not without influence there. I'm not going. I'll call Dean Stiffler. That's what I'll do. I said, I'm not going! Don't raise your voice to me, young man. I will raise my voice. Gabriel. Why, you little ingrate! All my life, you've shoved these quacks down my throat. Well, fuck them. I don't even want to be a doctor! Gabriel. Mom! You're all right. You're just stunned. Are you happy now? Dad, listen. I hated psych. I hated orgo. I hated those stupid toy stethoscopes. This is madness! You don't have any idea what you're saying. I gotta go. Bye, Mom. You're going to medical school next year. You owe it to this family! Don't you leave this house! Mark my words, boy. Come September, you'll be at Johns Hopkins! Mark my words! I don't know. Every fall I wonder the same thing. Will these new students do anything for the world? They seem satisfactory to me, Peters. Rather a good lot, in fact. Ahh, yes. Grunyan. I'm expecting great things from this Grunyan chap. Excellent. Excellent. Hmm? What's this? Higgs? You mean Higgs is coming after all? Quite a fine family there, those Higgs. Of course, the unfortunate circumstances last spring rather take the bloom off the rose, but, well, a mark for tradition, I'd say. Looks like we're going to have another generation of Higgs at Johns Hopkins after all. Evans? Everett? Frederick? Frye? Gaston? Gerson? Haught? Higgs? I want religion to where I relate... Gittelson? Jacobs? While plants may be at the bottom of the food chain, they are both the origin and source of life on this beautiful planet Earth. Now, let's take this white oak tree, for example. Before we begin cutting into this cadaver, I'd like to say a few words. It is always a pleasure to welcome a new class of students.
