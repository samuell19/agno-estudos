HUNTING SEASON Oh, I don't know. Would Olli like this? Or the airplane? Hey, check this out. Come on, that's too babyish. Eva! I mean that over there. You're married, did you forget? I didn't mean for me. Honestly, Eva. You haven't done anything with a man for ages. Ow! I need a Christmas gift for my son. You promised to help. What are you doing? Hey! Oh. Ow! No! Oh. Oh oh oh. - Listen! - Wait! - Oh oh oh. - Well then. Oh! - Ow! - Ow! I'm attacking! Retreat! Retreat! Assault! Retreat! Wait, I'm reloading! No, this won't do, the sight is crooked. Yeah, this is no sniper weapon. May I help you? Uh, yes. I, uh, would like... I need a Christmas gift for a boy... - He's eight years old now? - Yeah. But, he wants a dog. They can't have any pets in their current apartment. I need something to compensate for that. And it shouldn't cost a million euros. How about this robot? Hello, friend. I am Robert the robot. Fun to play together with the father. That swindler can buy something himself. He left. We had a short break for a few months. Five months. And then showed up with his 15-year-old. - 28-year-old. - It doesn't matter. There's this dog. You can jump with it. It's soft. Thanks, I'll find something myself. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you know what Sten and Isabel will gift Oliver? Eva, stop it. - It isn't a competition. - Ah. What's up with you and your phone? You're like a teenager now. Is everything okay? Eva, there's a really big issue. Damn it! Hey, what are you doing? Oh, hey, Marleen. - Hey, hey, Olli. - Hey. Where's Andres? Uh, he's at home. I'm here all alone now. Yes. - And you? - Well. Should we also tell Marleen what we're doing today? We'll be real life elves and bake what? A big gingerbread house. - Wow! - How cool! Is everything okay with you? Isabel is the best. Well, yes, of course. Mm-hm. May I help you? Hello. Eva. Mom, what are you doing here? Me? Uh, just on... Christmas watch. - Sorry! - No. Dogs aren't allowed in any circumstances. Oh, what if I promise you that... I'll teach it to bark very quietly? You can teach it to take showers, or use deodorant. Only the size of a hamster, but nothing bigger than that. A hamster? A hamster. Dear, Mom!!! Please come to... our Christmas party on Sunday. Oliver. Why are you putting junk in my mailbox? Oh. Mommy. Yes? Promise, you'll find this last puppy a good home as well? Dear, of course, we will. As good as ours? There isn't one quite as good, but we'll try. Thank you, dear. Darlings, what if I made cabbage rolls? Yes! And apple pie? Yes, apple pie! With ice cream. Yes, ice cream! Give Tupsu to me. Come Tupsu, let's go. - Apple pie. - Yes. Hello, this is the logistic department. Understood. We'll send it. Have a nice day. The new boss is coming. Eva. That's what he's like then. Last one got fired due to the sex scandal, and now we've got this bore. Eva. Eva! - Eva! - Mm? New boss. Hello. Don't flirt like that. - It won't get you any bonus points. - How? Don't smile at me like that. Completely frightened. Oliver's developmental interview at 14:00. - It works, right? - Yes, the facial cream. And it has no preservatives. Sorry, my driver side door didn't open. I couldn't get out of the car. What's she doing here? I thought it was a parent-teacher meeting. Hey, more like a discussion between home and school. Well, very nice. Nice to see you. I'm very happy that Oliver... You could have discussed this with me. is actively taking part in classes. Was this your or Isabel's idea? This Christmas party at your place. What do you think, Eva? What? Have you noticed... that when Oliver is studying at home, that he has a hard time concentrating? Uh, um, homework isn't our favourite topic. We try to make studying fun for him, so it would be fun for us as well. Some treats too sometimes, right Olli? You get candy at my place too. On Tuesday, you got both the cookies and... the stick of liquorice. Under treats, I meant more like organic fruits and nuts. That stick of liquorice was very organic. Maybe, we can listen to the teacher now. Right. So, we were at... Sorry. We were talking about Oliver having... Mom, seriously. trouble focusing. That's why we're here... to find solutions together. How to improve this... Just ignore it. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. Hey, Eva. It's so nice... that you've been also invited to the Christmas party. Don't worry. You won't be alone there. Very nice, I wouldn't go otherwise. Mom! Can we get the last puppy for ourselves? Darling, we talked about it. We can't unfortunately. I'm sorry. Why do we live in such a lame place? You know what, let's get it for us. - Huh? - Mm, should I ask Daddy? - Sten! - Huh? Let's adopt the last puppy ourselves. Of course, we will. - Really? - Of course, really. I'm sorry, but we already promised it to someone. Andres just said that it's available. A co-worker just bought it. Hey, it's all right. - Thanks! - Eva. Oh, my God. Allow Isabel give him the dog. They have everything. Now, they should also get the dog. How unfair should my life be? But think, at least, she has good intentions towards the boy. Think about it if she was the kind, who didn't like kids at all. She's very nice. And she's very fun. How do you know? You communicate with each other? Sten and Andres are best friends, what should I do then? You could give her a chance too. I don't know. I know. Let's all go to a café together. Think about doing it for Oliver. Hello, where are you? I'm sorry, I can't come today. - No? - Honestly, I have to go to the dentist. There's no way I can make it. What happened? I think I bit something. But maybe, it's a root canal. I hope it isn't that. That could end up being very expensive. When do you think it'll be over? Seems like it just finished. Relax, my dear. It's not a date. You just say "Hi" to Isabel, and I'll order us the coffee. Come. Oh, my God. Hey. Hey. It's so nice for us to meet here. Yes, yes. - Cool. - Cool, yeah. - Cool. - Hot, yes, very hot. - Your laces are untied. - What? Your shoelace is untied. Oh! Oh, my God. Is that an inflatable trampoline? I can jump on my head now. Sorry. - Maybe, I can help. - No, no, thanks. - I got it. I got it. - I got the zipper open now. - There you go. - I got it. - This side. - Thanks. Hey, you got an SMS. It's Marleen's phone. Going hunting in Pärnumaa this weekend. I'll think about you all the time. Heart-eyed-smiley, miss you. Peeter. Peeter? I'm in love. What? I'm completely screwed. I have a new co-worker, Peeter. I don't even understand what's happening. I love Andres. Why haven't you talked about it? I was hoping it would pass. Wait, you were talking about... wanting a second kid with Andres. Yes. What's the point of another child... if you dream of another man. Forget about it. Forget about it. Block him. Have you already like... - Dick-dick-dick-dick. - Oh, no. We haven't even kissed yet. That's what it is. You have to... - Well... - What? What, what? You need to bang away the temptation. - What? - Yes. Really, it will help. Uh-huh. - Hey... - Mm. - It might really help. - Mm-hm. Let's just hope he's very very boring. - Mm. - Then everything is fine. Marleen, is that what you really want? Hey, I have a mega great plan. I've got an idea, I'll help you. Oh, my God. Of course. Darling, that's what friends are for. I'll organize a "innocent" spa weekend. Let your Peeter visit before the hunt. Oh. You can't do that. Why not? Yeah, you can't. You have to do a Christmas party for Olli. - Exactly. - We'll be back on Sunday. Christmas is on Monday. I have time for everything. Let's focus on you right now. You're super. That's what friends are for. I'll come as well. - Are you sure? - Mm-hm. My best friend is in need. Of course. I'm completely sure. So, what's the plan? What did you tell your Peeter? Well, I haven't told him anything yet. What? He doesn't know that you're coming? What should I write to him? Hey, let's meet up for some sex, so I can forget about you? I mean, that's pretty bold. This plan is very weird, if I'm honest. You don't have to really do it. Wait, I know, I know. What? Isabel is writing messages for you? Huh? That... Maybe, she'll go have sex for you as well. Don't be such a bore. - Damn it. - Hey. Wait, wait, wait, Eva. Let's make it so you handle the driving... and I'll be the DJ. Is this supposed to come off? That's a really good song. Do you remember that? Marleen, let's meet at LaSpa! What? What's there.... - Well? - We are a go! You're going to meet tomorrow at LaSpa. You're going to meet tomorrow at LaSpa! He sent you a picture of an eggplant? Do you know why? Why? Well, I don't know. He's a vegetarian? Yes, he's a vegetarian. And he wants Marleen to also be... - a vegetarian. - Stop it! Okay. Let's hope the eggplant represents the size and not the colour. Marleen, smile, say "Peeter"! - Oh! - What? Seems like it's parked. Ah, damn it. I have to go out. Wait, wait. Wait. Ow, ow. Sorry, I don't know how this... It's a small scratch. Maybe, you can fix it with a pen. I don't care about the car. But, there are 28 children waiting for me. I need to go to that birthday right now. Hello children, I just peed my pants. Oh, you need a costume? Do you need a new costume? - Yes. - Uh... I have a sled and some skates in the car. The skates are a great solution. She's bringing them. Let's slit our wrists, and end this whole circus. Let's go check inside. I understand that I'm the clown, but maybe, we need something less funny. That's very good, very nice, fits well. And it's very timely gender equality. I believe that in the clown business, not everything is quite right with that. So with your dress, we can have a revolution in clowning. I don't have anything else to offer. - A swimsuit? - No. Uh, this, this will do. Welcome to our Laulasmaa LaSpa. Hello. Isabel Kaer, - we have a reservation for 3. - Uh-huh. But, we don't mind if there's enough space for a fourth. - So, please, here, here, and here. - Thanks. You have a dinner reservation? - Yeah. - And through the second floor, you can get to our NaudiSpa Wellness World... and water and sauna center. There's a sauna therapy session in the evening. Will you be paying with cash or card? I'll pay with a card. Okay. - 660 euros, please. - 660? 660? - One person? - Three. Oh. This will definitely be the most expensive... one night stand in history. What's that in krooni? That's, uh, 15.6... Eva, don't worry, I'll pay. No, you don't have to. Marleen is my friend and... just don't have any... You don't have material resources... because you live alone, I get it. It was my idea. The rooms are on the third floor, elevator is here. Have a nice vacation. - Thanks. - 660 times 15... - Come on. - Let's go. That's over 10,300 krooni. If the eggplant shows up tomorrow, what will we do today? Let's unpack, and the first stop is the jacuzzi. It's one thing giving her a chance, but I don't want to be naked... in a hot bath with her. - She is size XXS. - Calm down and enjoy. Marleen, put the phone away for a second. He sent me a baguette and two cherries. - Spaghetti? What? - A baguette. That's not Peeter, that's some teenage girl fooling you. It's cute in a way. Are you really going to cheat on Andres? And with Peeter... Focus on all the good things... that you have at home. - More bubbles! - Oh. Champagne. We were having a serious conversation. Serious? Why serious? Hey, we're at a spa. Enjoy it, Mommies. It's too early for this. Is it your nap time? You want to go take a little nap? Honestly, Eva, you're talking as if we were two old farts. And now for the bubbles. Remember, when you started living together with Andres, and you were so in love. Wait with that a little. We're in a jacuzzi. You have to have bubbles here. Okay, let's speak over this then. You were saying that Andres is very good in bed, right? That he can go down on you for an hour. What are you doing? Oh, that's nice. What was it with the second child? Whose idea was that? Mine. I felt like we should have another kid. Mm. So, Andres knows that... he has to be ready all the time? Yeah. It's like a sport for us. - Higher? - Oh, yeah. Do you have to give her a massage now? Eva, she's so good at it. But Isabel, you don't really know what Marleen likes. She likes foot massages. Oh! Eva! Wait a little. Hey, wait. I used to be a lifeguard. Help! Alright. Oh, my God. How she reacted. Just like that. You know what? You should thank her. Say something nice, at least. I came here with you. I'm naked in the middle of a spa. And my ear is locked up. Isn't that enough? Hello, I am Ken. Your sauna master. Today, we have bergamot steam... with a little eucalyptus and May bells. This combination will restore your energy... and erase negative thoughts, and cleanse toxins. That's just what we need. Isabel is awesome, right? Can you feel the May bells? Oh, my God! I can feel it. It's totally jingling. Something nice, right now. Isabel, that's a nice towel you have. It's the hotel towel. You have the same kind yourself. Oh, God, I don't know... what to give Olli for Christmas. He keeps only talking about the dog. Mm-mm-mm. That dog thing, yeah? Eva, do you have any ideas? For the gift? Air, I need air. Sorry. What are your plans with Sten? Are you going to get married? Marriage and children. He's already done everything with Eva. Well yes, but that doesn't mean that... it would be less important for you. I sometimes feel like an intruder. You know what? You could try not getting divorced. They haven't done that with Eva. Ah, oh! Peeter sent a message. Wait, listen. Marleen. What if it turns out... that Peeter is so amazingly great? I know. We can think of a pose now, that's the most uncomfortable. - What? - Agreed. So. What are you doing? Is this an uncomfortable pose for you? That one pretty much sucks, yeah. Or maybe like this? And then your toes go into your mouth. Ah, I have a good idea now. Like this. How does this look like? Is this an uncomfortable pose? That really is uncomfortable pose, yeah. And this is Marleen and... - Eva's room. - Hi, Sten. What? Is Eva okay over there? What are you doing here? - Exercising. - Oh, okay. We have these girly games here. Well, remember this then. That you only do it like this. Oh, God! He's completely wild. Marleen? Are you going to cheat on Andres during Christmas? I don't know what's going on. I don't even understand it myself. You don't have to do it. Forget about the breadstick and cherries. Baguette. Oh, sorry, the baguette. The worst thing about it is, I feel like I have to do it. Andres is so safe. He'll still love me in 100 years. I just want to take myself... and try my chances at the open market. Marleen, can you hear what you're saying? Isabel has driven you completely crazy. Why are you scratching all the time? What do you have here? Do you have lice? Huh? - Well? - Stop joking. The parents' list warned about that. Oh, my God. I think it's better if I sleep in Isabel's room. I can't meet Peeter if I have lice. Son, you're probably already sleeping. But, I just wanted to say goodnight. Hugs. Love you lots. - Hello. - Greetings. I need something for... for lice. Sorry, I didn't understand you. For lice. I still didn't understand. Sorry. You're itching? Mm-hm. Against lice? Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Are the lice in the hair or groin area? In the hair? Yes? By the seaside? Yeah, good. Thanks a lot. It was very useful. Your, your dress was even funnier than my regular costume. Thanks. That's the compliment I needed right now. Any time. Hey, the car thing, do you have insurance? Don't worry about the car. I have a repairman near here, who will fix it up for free. If he won't ask for money, then what? Well, yeah. What's bothering you then? That's not, uh, it's cough syrup. For a friend, who has... A cough? It was a wild guess there. Yeah. I'm also a psychic. Witch-clown Aadam, have you heard? - Aadam? - Yeah. Do you want me to predict the future? No, that's not necessary. I can see very well what the result is. No, no, no, no. Let the pro work. Oh, wow. These lines. I can see you feeling very good. Why? Because you met an interesting man. Intelligent guy. He has an interesting red nose. A drunk? Sorry, I was lying. I'm not a psychic. I'm just a clown. I was also lying. It's not cough syrup. It's for lice. What? That was a good joke there. There's some clown in you, I see. I try to live up to my wardrobe. Lice. Are those lice itching too? Hm? - Are they? - Itching. Here? Oh, of course, yeah. That's what lice do, itch. Well, are you coming? Where? Let's go fix up Marleen before Peeter comes. - Brazilian waxing? - Yes. They didn't have sugar depilation. Sugar depilation? Yes, it's basically the same, but with a warm caramel sauce. Marleen, that's not like you at all. A polished ping pong table. Be quiet. We'll do everything right now... for Marleen's date to succeed. What if Peeter likes... a more hairy approach? Eva, stop it. Isabel knows a little more about this. Maybe, that one. So, your landing strip is completely flat? Of course. Do you think that any pilot wants... to land in some kind of cactus bush? Uh-uh. Maybe, you should get it done as well? - Yes! - Maybe, you want a funny haircut? - Oh, come on. - It's Isabel's treat. - Yes? - No, where will I go like that? No. It's okay. You'll do it when you have someone, who you can enjoy it together with. You can wait then. Mm-hm. Hey. Look at this one. Marleen, darling. We got our ears pierced together, right? We had disco hairstyles done together. Of course, we'll go and let them... shave us clean together. - Well done. - Very good. Hey, I have to... I'll go to the bathroom and then come back. Yay! Next, please. No, I'm all clear there. It's your turn. Don't be shy, come on. - Come on. - But Marleen, she should... go first, for Peeter. You can't do it through pants. What? Remove your underwear. I don't really need to get it done. Hey, aren't you in the wrong place? No, that's my son. He had to come to work with Mommy today. Can't he wait outside? He's not going to peek. He's playing there by himself. Let's start from behind. - What? - On your belly. He's peeking. He's only staring at his screen. Stay calm. Help keep your cheeks apart. My what? Your buttocks. Hello. I thought I'd come see how you're doing. Very poorly, that boy is peeking. - Oh, oh! - It's her first time. Our hairball has never done this before. - Can you please wait outside? - Okay. Oh, listen. I thought I'd ask Marleen about the dog again. You know, for Olli. Maybe, she'll agree if I make her a very good offer? What? Ow! I'll go speak with her. Hello. - A lot of traffic in here. - Don't move! - Ow! Ow ow ow! - Oh. Whoa! Hello. Ave, can I put these things here? Yeah, do it. It's like a busy street here. Thanks. Have a nice ass... Goodbye. I'll go get the wider strips. Please, keep an eye on the wax heater, so it wouldn't overheat, okay? Karl, come on. Pst! Marleen! Marleen! What is it? You didn't give Isabel the dog, did you? No. Hurry up now. I don't want to leave it to the last minute. Oh, of course. You're in a hurry. Of course, come, come, come, come. Ready? Mm-hm. Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh, ow! Hurry up! We need cooling. Marleen's cheeks are burning. - What's burning? - The buttocks. Is this too big? What do you think? A cone, that's a good shape. With the wafer? - Hey, an ice pop. - Very good. - How many do we need? - A hundred. Hundred? How are you, Marleen? It's very nice, very nice. I just have to lie here... with an ice pop between my buttocks. But, it's nice. Oh, God. That Peeter thing will be cancelled now. Mm-hm. That's what you were dreaming of, yeah? Hit me if you want. Or bite my finger. If it makes you feel any better. Bite it. mm-hm. I need my finger back, because I have to message Peeter. Where's your phone? So, very good. Peeter thinks you have a migraine. He hopes you will feel better soon. The hunt starts on Sunday and he could meet up tomorrow. Lots of hearts, two glasses, and a trumpet. - Tomorrow? - Oh, my God! Thank you, dear. Will this be better by tomorrow? Her rear end is like a baboon's butt. Don't worry. A bit of my magic cream... and everything will be fine soon. - Magic cream, yeah? - Mm-hm. It's a bleaching cream. Turns darker body parts lighter. So, it's more festive and bright. Why does the back door have to be festive? How bad can it be? When's the last time you checked yours? Here's the data from the data department that... Mr. Chairman of the Board asked for. This is some interesting data. What? What is she doing? What the butt? - No, that's not... - Yes. Oh, my God. Please. Beer? Yes, but it tastes just like wine. Alcohol free for you, like you asked. I still can't believe it. That I showed them... What did I show them? They'll forget about it. Yeah, by the year 2040. So. they saw your butt-crack. Big deal! It could have been worse. Yes. They could have seen Marleen's. Sight. Igloo. - You're ruining it again. - Ladybug! - Wait now! - Dragon! - Sight! - It's not! Heart! - Clef! - I can't. Don't, stop, take it easy. - Wait, wait. - Candle! Candle! It's a candle. Wait, now it's mine... - Like a snowflake! - Snowflakes! Oh. Thanks. Oh, my God. It smells so good. What time does Peeter get it? Peeter, Peeter, Peeter. In four and a half hours. Okay, I'll do it and then it's done. Four and a half hours? No, now it's 4 hours and 29 minutes. Twenty eight. Don't worry, we'll keep you busy. I know! - What we're going to do. - So? I'll figure it out in a moment. So. Ah. - What does this number mean? - Eight. I don't know if I just feel it, or that guy is really staring at me constantly. Mm, I don't think so. He seems like the kind of guy who looks at everyone. - Pretty heavy. - It's heavy, yeah? See that? He looked at me now, smiled at me. Did you see that? - He smiled at me? - Mm. I thought he smiled at me just then. - Look! - Look! He looked, he looked at me. He looked me in the eyes. He just looked me in the eyes. We made eye contact. Did you see? He just looked. - He just looked. - He turned. He turned towards me. He turned towards me. Watch this. - One more. - Sure. Oh, my God, Marleen! You're right. He was looking at you. Ah, this is impossible. We have to cancel with Peeter again. Your other hand is fine though. They'll give you some painkillers... and you'll forget about it in 15 minutes. I don't understand how that happened. That guy has problems concentrating. - Well, Eva tried flirting with him. - What? He was looking at Isabel. - You're doing everything to ruin it. - No! I didn't say, I... You only think about yourself! - I'm here and it will be fine. - Thanks. I'm also here for you. Open up, yeah. - Here, let me help. - Ow! - Oh. - Oh, my God! Thanks. Hello Olli, it's Mommy. I called for no reason. I just wanted to ask how you're doing. Goodbye, son, my dear. Eva! Hey, what are you doing here? Hello Aadam. Wait, let me guess... You hit someone with your car again? No, I helped a girlfriend get hurt. Oh. I sure am good at messing up. I get paid for doing that. I'm just going to a job. Come with me. Tea or coffee? That's it. The party is over. Peeter is going hunting. We have to go to our Christmas party. Is that Eva over there? Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Frank! What is she doing? All while I'm here dying. I'm clown Aadam. And I'm clown Eva. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. One, two, three, dust and ashes. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Now, Aadam came to Eva. And gave her a flower. Here you go. Thanks. ♪ They bring you home for Christmas. ♪ ♪ And decorate your branches. ♪ ♪ Oh Christmas bauble ♪ ♪ Oh Christmas bauble. ♪ ♪ How dear you are to me. ♪ That was so much fun! The children were like... That's how it is with children. That's why I do this. You were so awesome. You were so fun. They were laughing at you mostly. At me? I'm telling you, you're good at this. We should do something together. People usually cry next to me. Show me your scarf trick. I do it differently myself. So, you put it around your neck... - Yeah. - and... Ah, that's so good. - Because I do it like this. - Yeah. What did you do? It hurts, but it works. - Very good, it's okay now. - Ow! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Um. I have to get going now. Yes. Where's my bag? Bag? Did you leave it there? - Wait, wait. - Hey, I left it... I'm going here, going here. Here you go. - Yes. - Well, yes. So. Going home then. Let's go home. Listen now, Marleen. I know, what you should do. I'll take Frida with me tonight. And you can stay home alone with Andres. With no stress or worries, that's exactly what you need. Well. Maybe, that's true. But then, she won't get over her Peeter. Hey, let's stick to my plan. We're going to the hunt. We're going to that damn hunt. They won't let us go to the damn hunt. They will, if you know someone who has a hunting license. I've been shooting ducks with my father since I was a kid. I have a summer home in Pärnu. I can't believe this. That's super. I told you. It's totally awesome. Wait. Hey, look at that. You see, this store... Now you have a new chance as well. Try to get along with Isabel before Christmas somehow. She's not making it easy. By trying to help me? I do too. It's always been like that. Your problems are my problems. Eva, I think that this is... - all too much for you. - No, it's not. Just tell me what I've got to do, I will do it. Can you hold yourself back a little during the hunting? Eva, this is my last chance. Isabel knows these things. Okay? Let's just do what she says. Ah. Alright. Mm-hm? Okay, if that's what you want. Girls, we're in trouble. That Santa dropped out, we need a new one. Eva! Come on! Oliver will recognize me. Eva, I mean the clown that you had back there. Doesn't he want to play Santa? Can you ask him? Please. It's pretty open here. There's a lot of people as well. Like having sex on the Town Hall Square. Relax, there's a party in the evening. So men, there will be 4 drive hunts. You can shoot ducks, pigeons, rabbits, pandas, and koalas. Of course, if you can find any. What? Cheers. I'll go for a bit, - I'll be right back. - Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay. He's coming this way. What should I say? - What do I say? - Ask if you can be his charger. - What? - What? Doggy! Yeah, careful. That's the manor owner's dog. He's very mean. All our butts have his bitemarks on them. Peeter! Look! Have you seen this? Oh, wow. Do you want to try it? Oh, my. You mean right now? Do you have anything better to do here? No, no. Come on then. I'll find you later. Great, I lost to a hunting rifle. Very good, he's a bonehead. You'll want to go home to Andres then. Hey, don't be sad now. You can be my charger instead. It's cool that she has a hunting license. It's very awesome, yeah. Oh! Oh oh oh oh. That's not so hard. That can't be very difficult. Give me the gun, I'll try. No, you can't without a license. Who says so? The weapons act. Especially, if you've been drinking. Keep an eye on it, I'll go mark it. I have binoculars here. I saw this out of the corner of my eye. That the tree I sat on was a bear. Luckily, it wasn't. But, the danger was great. Damn it. Oh! What? Eva! What are you doing, Eva? I picked it up and it went boom. Have you gone insane? Don't be jealous now. I think there was an animal there. Where? Eva, you may have shot someone. - What? - What, where? Somewhere a bit further there. Oh, my God. What? Is this a rabbit? - Oh, God. - Damn it, we're done for now. Oh, my God! I'm so sorry. Forgive me. This is horrible. You shot him. Do you understand? It's a dog. It's the manor owner's dog. Ah, what? What? Uh-oh. Aren't they like trained? Trained to do what? Catch bullets with their teeth? Marleen, listen. Can't we give the manor owner... one of your puppies as consolation. That puppy has been promised to someone else. Do you remember? I'll lose my hunting license now. Don't worry. I'll take the blame. - I'll say "I did it". - But, you did do it. Yes, but it was under my responsibility. We'll both be fined. You should have taught me then. Oh, God. You could have controlled... your jealousy just a little bit. We have to get rid of him. Hurry, before someone comes. We have to bury him very deep. Or the other dogs will find him. Because they'll think he's a bone? Wait. But maybe, we can... put the gun next to him. So it looks like an accident. And put the paw on the trigger, so it looks like a suicide? Well sorry, Mrs. Poirot. This is my first time killing anyone. We need a body of water. Okay. We need some kind of weight. Let's cut him open, fill him with rocks, then sow him back up later. Could you stop your solo for a second? Your one night stand is coming. Oh, damn it. - The dog! - Oh, the dog! Oh, I finally got away. Very cute. Isabel was just stating to show us how to hunt. I can show you that myself. Oh, damn it. Damn! Have you seen my dog? Son, haven't seen your son. - Dog. The dog. - Rocco is missing? - Yes, completely missing. - Missing? I don't know, haven't seen him. - Have you seen him, girls? - We haven't. We haven't seen him. Rocco? Maybe, somewhere over there further away? The dog hiding places are over there. Damn dog has gone crazy. The whole forest smells like women. Rocco! You should help him look for the dog. - No, but I thought, we... - Go, go. Be a friend, go help look. You'll see Marleen in the evening. Listen. If we can't get rid of the dog, then we have to kill it. Let's fake an accident or something. There we go, now. - Put him here. - Here? - Put it, put it. - A car is coming. - I'll start cleaning. - Eva, put it now. - Whose idea was this? - A car is coming. Eva, a car is coming! Put the dog down! Eva, a car is coming! Put it down! Just put it down. Let's go, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go. The jacket, the jacket. Eva, what are you doing? The jacket. All right. Come on, Eva! - Come, Eva! - The gun! - Take the gun! The gun! - Take the gun! Gun, gun! Eva! Gun. Eva, come on! Relax, everything is going to be fine. What's going on? The women shot Sass' dog. It will survive, there's hope. The dog will be fine. - It will be fine. - Yeah. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine! Maybe, it's for the best if you leave. - Yes. - It was all my fault. Maybe, Marleen could stay, then you could like finish. The party is cancelled. But, come with us then. So you could with Marleen... No, I... - That would be weird. - But, the dog survived. Are you done? We can go. - Please, take your bag. - Yeah. - Come on. - Everything will be fine. So much for my hunting license. And music! Where's the button? It's somewhere, look for it. It probably meant to be. Higher powers intervened... to stop you from doing something dumb. I wonder why these forces didn't intervene in your life. Didn't you try to be friend... even just a little bit with Isabel? No, but I think that... I have done so a little bit. Can I give her the puppy then? Yes, yes, okay. Hey, our day has been saved. Peeter is coming here. - What? - Peeter is coming here. - Are you kidding? - I'm not. - He's coming to see you. - Now? Yes, get yourself ready. Oh, God. - I have to take a shower. - What will you wear? Hair up or down? Down and a little curled. Let's start with underwear. Damn, these aren't sexy at all. They're all covered in sticky ice cream. Couldn't you have used ice instead? - Wear these. - Oh, okay. - That's pretty good. - Yeah. Start getting ready. Are you borrowing her underwear? Eva, stop it, please! Try doing anything that you promised! For all of us. Hey, it's the Christmas party tomorrow. My nerves are completely shot. - So. - So beautiful. But, you know what? I would open a little bit more over here. - I don't know, isn't it too much? - No. Oh, my God. He's going to eat you up. - You think? - Mm-hm. Isabel, I was smelling some, before, some of your... wonderful creams. Can I maybe try some? Yes, of course. What do you want, for dry skin, oily skin, against wrinkles? I don't know. Maybe, you can recommend? Hey. - He's here. - He's here. Help! He's here. He's here. He's here. - Do you remember the pose? - What pose? - Just like this. - Oh, come on. Quiet now. - He's here. - Be quiet. I'll turn off your light. Oh, mother dear. Here we go. - What are you doing? - Taking my bag. This whole Peeter affair is a sick idea. Why? It won't solve anything. It just breaks something nice. You can't fix a midlife crisis like this. What do you even know about it. What do you know about it? What do I know? I know that someone has taken my life... and swallowed it in an instant. And some romp with a random stud... won't give it back to me. Your life again, Eva, just your life? Marleen's life won't get better either, because everything is great for her. Yes, but my life is somewhere as well. Don't you understand? Everything doesn't revolve around you. Maybe, everything doesn't happen in an instant for me. Maybe, it's tough for me too, Eva, to understand how Olli and Sten... and this whole thing... Are you imagining that I'll help you with this? That I'll help you remove myself from their lives? No, no, no. I won't do that. Just let them be happy, Eva. I'm not at fault that you and Sten... Enough. I'm not going to dissect my life with you... because there's no hope for me anyway. But, Marleen can still be saved. This whole fuck-trip has to be stopped here now. Have you gone mad, Eva? I'm Marleen's best friend... and I won't let her ruin her life. Marleen, don't do it. It's wrong. Eva! What are you doing? This whole banging away the temptation, it's wrong. Marleen, it's deceiving yourself. You have a midlife crisis, and it's not something that an eggplant can fix. It will just make things worse. Trust me. And this comes from a woman, who since her divorce hasn't had... any fruits! Eggplant is a vegetable. And I could have sampled the whole fruit aisle, - but I didn't want to. - Uh-huh. You know what? You won't want to, if you keep blaming Isabel for everything, not yourself. Can't you act for even just a second... like a real true friend? You mean like Isabel? Someone who can see something other than themselves. Oh, very well. Next time when you're in trouble, then go to your real friend. By the way, those aren't her underwear. Do you have a problem of some kind? Get dressed. Great, this is what I was missing. Yes? Hello there, how's it going? Oh. Everything is top notch. Uh-huh, it's on the second notch for me. When I get home from Pärnu, then I'll laugh at it. Sorry. Occupational disease. Did you say you were in Pärnu? Hey, I'm there. - Yeah. - Let's meet up. Let's discuss your cool Christmas party. I have nothing to do with it. Uh-huh. How so? I'm learning to live with the knowledge... that I'm easily replaceable. You know what I do when I feel like that? Oh! Oh! Whoo! Oh! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Oh, you're right. It's really like rebirth. Hello, I'm Jürgen. Hello Jürgen. Hello. Jürgen. It's a shame you're Jürgen. I was starting to like the Eva. It's good that I was nearby. Do you want an apple? Good frozen apple. Thanks. You know what? I decided... that I'm not going to the Christmas party. Not going to the Christmas party? - Not going. - What will your son think? - Everything will be messed up. - How so? I either go there... and I'll be alone like a complete fool. Or I don't show up at all... and everyone will think, what a selfish bitch I am. That's a tough choice. But if you don't have it in you... to be there for you son, then it's better to stay away. What? Of course, I can be there for Oliver. I can do that any time. - And it's not about that at all. - What is it then? I don't have to let some clown interrogate me. Wait, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Go blow on your horn. Well, Pontu. Let's teach you to bark and give your paw. You'll go to dog school. Yeah. Hey. Hello. Hey. You've been working hard here, I see. You got back nicely afterwards? Yes, we ordered a taxi. Hey, Mom! Oh, hey. Hello, dear son. Merry Christmas. What is that big surprise... that you promised me? Uh-huh, you'll see soon. But, I think I found something... that you'll be very happy about. Are you sure it's not the same thing... that Isabel wants to give me as well? She also said that she's got a big surprise. Oliver, come look! That's... Oh, well. - How are you? - I'm great, you? Great, try the pickles. So then. Well, hello. Hello. Try the organic carrot. Is that dipping sauce... or Isabel's organic butt cream? Damn it. There you go, Pontu. Damn it. Doggy. Doggy, doggy, doggy. Doggy, doggy. Doggy, doggy, doggy. So, you decided to come after all. I shouldn't have come. Are you looking for something? Me? No. No. How about a lost apology? I can give you the apology later. Well hello, let's get started. I'm an idiot. Oh, hello, children! Hello, Santa. - The dog is missing. - What? It's not in the car. Eva! Yes? Where's the dog? What dog? Isabel's gift to Oliver. What? I'm getting a dog? When your mother says what she did with him, then yes. Me? You've been against it from the beginning... that Isabel wants to give Oliver a dog. Mom. I wouldn't quite say it like that. How would you say it then? Mom, you're so mean. You hate Isabel and think... - that I don't know that. - Oliver. Just say what you did with the dog. Okay, I'll go find him. I'll come with. Children, let's go inside then. Show me how your tree is decorated. Where the hell is it? You have such an unbelievable ego. Coming from a woman who just cheated on her husband. I didn't get that far. Oh. Did Isabel convince you? No. You did, stupid. Good. You should thank me then. I would have thanked you if you wouldn't be such an idiot. Over there. What are you doing? My boss lives here. The one I showed my butt to. Maybe, your dentist will come here too? Okay, I'll go get the dog myself. No, I have to do it. So. Oh! For you, my dear. Yes. - Here you go. - Yes. Thank you in advance. Oh my, a scarf. Oh, my God. - Socks. - Socks. Socks... Oh, thank God. Oh, you got him. At the cost of my job. This is your gift. You give it to him. Are you sure? Eva, I know I'm already pulling so much of the attention to myself. You're young and fun and pretty. A slightly irritating phenomenon that I probably have to get used to. You can't imagine how much Oliver talks about you. What would Mom do and... what would Mom say. That might be slightly irritating as well. I'm just trying to keep up at your level. Thanks. How's Christmas? Are you ready? Look over there. Merry Christmas, Oliver. What's his name? Mom. Mm? Thanks. Thanks. - What's this? - Here you go. A Christmas gift for you. Oh. So... Now, it's time to hand over the apology. - No, I didn't mean. - Here you go. Thanks. This was Oliver's gift. But, I don't think he'll need it anymore. I could always use a cute little rodent. Allow me to introduce Aadam, Pontu. - Pontu? A dog's name? - Mm-hm. He doesn't bark. Very good. The head of the cooperative will like it. I am the head of the cooperative. - Where is Pontu? - What? Pontu is gone. The hatch is open. - In the back seat? - Where is he? He's under the pedals! Look! Look! What happens now? We have to report this accident. - At the police station? - No. At my place. I have good wine. And it's also the holidays.
