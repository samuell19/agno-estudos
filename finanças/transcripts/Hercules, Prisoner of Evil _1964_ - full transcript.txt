URSUS, THE TERROR OF THE KIRGHIZ Take this. Ursus! Don't leave those skins in the sun anymore or they'll dry out too much. Take them down. Load them in the cart. The cart's just about ready. Only the horses have to be hitched. - Everything alright? - Yes, all the skins are good. And they're easy to work. Next time we'll go hunting in the mountains. Varo says there are lots of deer up there. Ursus! Ursus, down there in the bottom of the valley, There are 4 carts in flames. And dead bodies. The monster? Yes. I saw two women three men-theirfaces. It was terrible. Let's go! Wait, I'm coming! Come over here! If we can get him to Meriva, Amok might be able to save him. Look around through the woods, there may be other survivors. Afterwards come back to Meriva. We'll have to organize patrols for tonight. Prince Zereteli, Our patrols just brought in an urgent message. The monster struck again last night. Give me the details. Near Meriva. He attacked a caravan of merchants. They were all killed and disfigured. Everything's burned. Our patrols only heard about it much later. This is an area controlled by Ursus and his men. They're the ones responsible for that zone. Those cursed Cherkes! The tribe of Ursus! Traitors. Every one of them The monster never kills them. He only attacks us Kirghiz. I'm sure the Cherkes are behind all this. We muststrike, or we'll become slaves to those barbarians. You're right, we must strike without hesitation. Before we can attack the village, we mustget Ursus out of our way. I'll take a company of cavalry on ahead through the Turgi woods. We'll wait for you there. Get away. I did everything I could, Ursus. If only he had lived. He could have told us about the monster. Thank you, Amok. I'll be back in a few days. You'll need to keep sentries posted all through the night. And send out patrols. Goodbye, sir. What do you want? The monster has claimed more victims. Why worry? Are you afraid he'll displace you on the throne of Sura? Be serious, Aniko. It's the man behind the monster who hopes to siton the throne. And you know who that is? - Go ahead. - Ursus. That's interesting. It doesn't matter whether it's true or not. You'll have to convince your chiefs that it is. What do you mean? What I said. But why won't you try to understand me? My dear cousin, when you come of age in a few months, you'll be proclaimed queen of Sura So I've chosen a husband for you. Really? Yourfriend Navar? No, you will marry me. The Prince Regent will wed the future Queen. This union will allow us to dominate this country against everything and everyone. You seem to have forgotten the monster. No, I haven't forgotten. Because that is precisely why you must marry me When the panic spreads, all the tribes will rise in revolt. The Cherkes will accuse us and hold us solely responsible for this situation and thus seize power. Ursus will find it child's play, to have himself named Great Khan without opposition. If he really wanted the throne who could say no? You? If that's the case, why does he need the monster? You should know the reason. Me? I've always wondered if you were the monster. You'll pay for that! No, Prince, I'm not afraid of you. It's too late. You should have gotten rid of me ten years ago it would have been easy then. But even if you had eliminated me as one rival you'd still have Ursus and the Cherkes. It would be unwise of you even to entertain the notion of an alliance with anyone but me. All I ask is to live my own life. Very well. And I will help you to live it. We must strike again. This symbol of death which once guided us into conspiracy against the Great Khan, will again serve as a sign of our new alliance. The peril that threatens us now is even greater than it was then. We must swear to eliminate not just one man but a whole people: The Cherkes. Chance will designate the murderer. Only one of these daggers has a point. The blade of freedom will liberate us forever from our bitterest enemy. The head of Cherkes. He must die. You... You. You. You. You have been selected as the instrument of fate, Nippur. You're strong and fearless. And you will find it easy to fulfill our vengeance. Patrolling every night, and no sign of him. He's staying away from Ursus. How does the monster know where we are, if we change zones every single night? Maybe he just follows his nose like any other animal. Where is Zereteli? I'm going to take you back to him. He's in the village beyond the valley At the edge of the Turgi forest. Saddle up the horses. I'm going to deliver him to his friend Zereteli. Ursus... You were right, it was one of Zereteli's men. Of course. Zereteli would never dare face you himself. That's why he's so treacherous. Promise me you'll be careful. I promise. If you'll stop taking risks. But I had to come and warn you. I love you, you know. And I'm always so afraid for you. Prince Zereteli, a Cherkessia patrol is arriving. I bring you back your friend Nippur, who died trying to carry out your orders. Take the body inside. I warn you, Zereteli. If you want war, I'll give it to you. Your suspicions are unfounded. You've been misinformed. Nippur wasn't acting on my orders. In any case, watch your step. From this momenton, you can't hide behind your men. You falsely accuse me of a crime I did not commit. But you forget I'm Prince Regent of Sura. So let me give you a little warning. If you should try to impose your laws, Sura will give you proof of her power. You'll pay for this. Where's Ursus? He's with his patrols on the other side of the trap. If the monster tries to enter the valley tonight from this side, he won't get away from us. This side, you're right. But from the south? The monster. Hurry Miko, call Ursus. Give the signal. I will. The horses, in front! Go! There he is! He's heading for the trap. He won't get away, Stop! Free yourself, if you can. Somebody cut me down. Help! That's no monster. Quick! Hurry up! I'll get even with you! You'll get what you deserve! You're a band of idiots! All of you! Crazy! Get me down! Outof this! Stop looking at me like idiots! Release me! Release me, you rabble! Ursus will make you pay for this! Release me, bandits! - Get me down! - Why should I defend you? Because you're my brother. Yio, my brother... Lower him! Welcome back to Earth! Whatever made you run away from your friends? Friends... some friends. The way you treated me, I rather be your enemy. Sorry, Yio. Buta terrifying monster lurks on our land. And we... Thank you for the compliment. Send him away. Beware. If I learn you've conspired with Ursus, you're finished. What will you do? Will you poison me or send the monster to me in the night? It's time to marry. We won't have to worry about it. We'll reign together. An excellent idea. This is the only solution. Except that I do not accept it. I advise you to think about it. Think about it, Aniko. Just look at that. They're wonderful, aren't they? We'd forgotten that such things still existed dancing, feasting. Tell me... Have you ever seen this monster? No, never. Do you believe in its existence? Of course. I'm afraid I'm not convinced. Shotts, get back here! It's hopeless, he's seen Kato. - Enough. - A little bit more. You know, I love her a lot. As a sister. She's been with us since childhood. But she's not of our race. No. But she doesn't know it. She ran away from a gypsy caravan. When I happened to stumble across her, she was more dead than alive. She had a very serious injury to her head. I think that's what caused her to lose her memory. It happened a long time ago. She never wanted to leave. So she stayed. She turned out very well, I'd say. It's for you. Nothing serious, but I have to go. - You can sleep in my tent. - Thanks. - Don't wait for me. - Good night. - What's your name? - Kato. What are you doing in this camp? I am the slave of Ursus. But we have no slaves. Ursus has. Aniko... Finally! What's wrong? I escaped only because of a meeting of the Kirghiz chieftains called by Prince Zereteli. I'm so afraid This meeting can only mean war between our peoples. Today he proposed marriage to me so that he could hold all power. Please don't take this lightly. Zereteli is ready to do anything to obtain absolute sovereignty. Then I'll call a meeting of all Cherkes chiefs, to try and halt any provocation. My brother Yio will deal with the Kirghiz tribes. You have a brother? Yes, he has just returned. He traveled widely. He is very intelligent He will be very useful to us. Why haven'tyou mentioned him before? I hope you're not jealous of him. No, Ursus. But I shouldn't like your brother's clever negotiations to separate us forever. The reappearance of the monster, is as I always feared, a deliberate and cold blooded Cherkessia provocation to bring disorder and chaos on our land. The connection between Ursus and the monster is now clear to all. Ursus has the hope and dream of touching off a civil war. The gods willing, this shall notoccur. But we have to prepare for the worst. I have shown you the danger. Thus, in accordance with our sacred and ancient laws I, Prince Zereteli, Regentof Sura, ask forfull powers. Hooray! Where are we? We're near the grottos of the Falcon. - Do you know them well? - I've been there once. Whatare you doing here? We've been out hunting for the monster all night. It managed to get into the camp. Into the camp? Was anyone hurt? No, but he came into our tent. To kill me. Maybe he thought it was me. But once again I wasn't there. Come along. Get out! It is well sharpened. A good sword is man's best friend. - Where is Ursus? - He's gone to Meriva. Come out and try the sword. No, I trust you. By the way, there's something that's been bothering me. I wonder if you can help me. When the monster came into the hut, how do you account forthe fact that the dog didn't bark? Shotts is old and deaf. So deaf that he didn'teven hear Kato screaming? Yes, that is strange. If Ursus returns, let me know. Yes Yio. I heard something fall on the ground. Of course, it was a dagger. Kato! Where's the dagger the monster had? You hid it, didn't you? This dagger belongs to Ursus! What do you know? A message for Ursus. Who brought it? The same Kirghiz who brought him the message the nightof the feast. Well, I'll give it him. "Don't forget." "I'll be waiting at dawn." But where? And who? Our patrol captured Yussup on his way back from Ursus' camp. Torture him. I need to know where Aniko and Ursus are meeting. And find out fast. Bravo... Your information was quite correct. This one will also be yours as soon as you've earned it. What are you doing here? Hello. Who are you? You're a stranger here? Yes, I arrived yesterday. You are Yio. How do you know my name? Is it Ursus who sends you? Tell me... Is this your message? Come. We have many things to talk about. Come. This is where Ursus and I always meet. We love each other and soon we'll be married. You're the first to know our secret. Who are you? Aniko, the daughter of the Great Khan. The future queen of Sura. Yes. Why do you meet here? My cousin, the regent, does not like the Cherkes. Least of all, Ursus. A foolish question. Sorry. It was also stupid for me to take the message. Ursus won't be coming now because he didn't know you would be here. In that case I'll have to tell you what I intended to tell him. Sit down, you seem tired. I am a little. I wondered around this forestall afternoon before finding the cave. Don't be so tense. I'll getyou some wine to relax you. A very special wine. Try this Get some rest. Then I hope you won't mind walking me back to the city. I'd rather not go back alone. I'll be glad to. - Has he spoken? - No. Yussup, do you hear me? Where is Aniko? Where did she go? Torture him some more. Make him talk. Where is Ursus? He's searching over by the rocks. Do you have any news? What news could there be? If Ursus is by the rocks, the monster must be near the other side of the valley. Let's go. Grisha! We caught sight of him in the woods! Make sure he doesn't pass us! Come on! The scream came from over this way! Ursus... Help me lift him. The monster is in the woods! He's trying to kill Ursus! He's wounded. Is it serious? Yes. Prepare a stretcher. We will bring him to Amok. Ursus! Forgive me. Forgive me, Ursus. It's one of our men. Prince, the monster attacked the camp of the Cherkes. Ursus is wounded and they're carrying him to Meriva. And they haven't killed the monster? No, not even Ursus could accomplish it. He got away through the forest. Did you hear that? We must change our plan. We will attack Meriva which is empty, since the men are scouring the countryside for the monster. And when they return, they'll find only the traces of what was once their village. And we all know who will get the credit for destroying the village, don't we? The monster. Yes. Warn Navar and the others. Let's go! Forward! Forward! Find Navar. Bring him to me! Stay here. Pretend you're wounded and when Ursus gets here, say it was the work of the monster. Then follow us and try to warn of us of their plans and kill Ursus if you get the chance. And when they see that I'm not wounded? Now nobody can say that. Take away the body of Sandor. Navar will be the only Kirghiz soldier to remain in Meriva or what's left of it. Come quick! Meriva is burning! Varo, Varo! There's no trace of Yio. We've searched for him everywhere. Keep searching. We must find him at any cost. Look as far as the village at the other end of the valley. You men accompany the caravan. The others with me! - Who are you? Who did this? - The monster. The monster broke in. We tried to stop him, but he set fire to everything. He killed everybody. What are you doing here? You are not our people I am a merchant from Kirghiz, I ask for hospitality for just one night. I can't believe the monster could have done all this by himself. Any other survivors? - And Amok? - He's dead, too. He's lying in that hut. And Amok? I'm afraid he's dead. Any news? Nothing. Yio can't be in this part of the country. Anyway, we don't have anymore time to look for him. We must find reinforcements and go join Ursus. You recruit the tribes in the Mountains. And I'll work my way down the valley. We must find reinforcements. The Kirghiz are bound to take advantage of Ursus' condition and attack us. That's certain. We can meet again after we've had time... Yio... Where have you been? We've been looking for you for hours. The horse threw me when I was coming from the palace. The palace? You were in Sura? No. That night, I was sick. I wasn't feeling well, I fell asleep in a cave. I must have lost my way. Sorry you had to spend the night looking for me. It was to give you bad news. Ursus is wounded. - Is it serious? - The monster attacked the village. Ursus fought the monster and was defeated. - Let's go. - He's not in the village. They've taken him to an old hermit in the mountains who hopes to cure him. Stay with us. We'll go join him when our reinforcements arrive. - When did all this happen? - In the middle of the night. You were certainly a long way away if you heard nothing. You, get going. Tell them we need every man. Come here a minute. You see this horse? We brought it for you. Because when you left the camp, we knew you didn't have one. Which is why it seems strange that you were thrown. From what? It's better not to question certain things. Take my word, Frido. Where are you going in such a hurry? This is our land. It was your land. Now it's ours. Don't talk like an idiot! Just ge tout of the way! Who are you to speak so arrogantly? Yio, the brother of Ursus. This is a gift from heaven. Zereteli will pay well... Grab them! Don't let them get away! To your horses! They must be caught! There they are. Hurry, they've seen us. Search the place thoroughly. Make sure there's no other way out. We didn't find them, but there is a crevice leading outof here. Maybe they jumped down there. If they did, they must have smashed themselves to bits. Let's go see. It was the will of the gods that you knew this hiding place. When did you discover it? Last night. This cave looks lived in. It is a shelter, but for whom? Don't waste time talking. If they come back they might find us. We're safer hiding in the forest. But it's got to be here. What? - A secret spring that moves the stone. - I see nothing. But she opened it right here. - I said "she." - Yes. - Any questions? - No, Yio. There should be some torches here. There's nothing here. If we don't find that spring, we'll be trapped in here the rest of our lives. No, Frido. If we don't find a way out, it's only a question of waiting. Before long, someone will come and that wall will open. Life is born out of suffering. And often suffering will bring back life. The pain will not last long. Ursus... His wounds have closed and these herbs will cure him Have faith, Kato. You'll see, my dear. In less time than you can imagine he'll be entirely cured. He'll be powerful again and invincible as he used to be. You're sure that she returned at dawn and is about to go out again? Yes, so when will I go and tell her that she won't be seen? Good. Let her go. The way is open. And not a word about Ursus being wounded, understand? What do we do? We follow her. Assemble the men. Come quickly. We'll never get out of here. It's suffocating. Turn off some of those torches, there's too much smoke. There should be something to drink over there in a leather flask. Frido... Frido! No, what are you doing? Stop! Who are you? Don't! Get away! Aniko, save yourself. Frido... - Is he dead? - I don't know. I saw the body of the man who was with me. But no trace of the monster. Let's go. Wait. Where is Ursus? - Wasn't he with you? - No. He was wounded by the monster. Where is he? They took him to a healer to try and cure him. I must be with him. Take me, please. How do you open it? Open it quickly! Hold him. I'll get her. Open up. Aniko! Open up. Or we'll leave you in there to die. Help me. This is what you want. You'll never be able to get out of there. This will be your tomb. Save her, Zereteli. Save her! The monster is inside. Let him have her! You're a monster, Zereteli. But the gods will punish you for all the evil you've done! Keep you're filthy mouth shut, Cherkessian. You'll die in there all alone! No! Let me out! Take him. Ursus will have to pay with a kingdom if he wants to see you alive! Take him away! Free me, I beg you. Let me out! When Ursus awakens, he'll be cured. Assassin! I know who you are! You murdered the Great Khan! Who are you? Who sent you? Zereteli. I was to kill you. Just like he commanded me to kill the Great Khan ten years ago, . Has she recovered her memory? For a moment, yes. Forever, I can not say. Can't you cure her like you cured me? Her mind is sick and in the hands of the Dark Spirits. When she wakes up, and comes back to us, we will find out if she has regained her memory for good. What she said is true. This coward confessed before dying. But how did she know? It is you who broughta message to the Cherkessian camp, right? You brought Aniko's message to Ursus. Aniko... I've told them nothing. Go to the princess, tell the princess I've told them nothing. I cannot tell her. She is trapped in the Grotto of the Falcon where the monster lives and he'll kill her if he comes back. No, she can speak. She can speak to the spirits. What do you mean? Listen to me, Yio. You know who I am? Yes. I know many things. - What do you know? - Give me a drink. What do you know? It is not possible. No, it's not true. It can't be true. This is the moment of crisis. Perhaps she has regained her memory. All of this is unbelievable. If what she said is true Zereteli will pay for his heinous crime. We found one man still alive when we went to bury the victims of the massacre. He spoke to us. It wasn't the monster that destroyed the village, but Zereteli and his men. He even led the attack himself. What about the men you were recruiting in the mountains? Have they arrived? Yes, most of them. Saddle the horses. We leave atonce. Surprise is going to be the determining factor. Very well. I'm Aniko. I'm Aniko. Aniko... Loves Ursus. Our spies have reported warlike preparations among the Cherkessian tribes. It seems obvious they are preparing to attack Sura. We need more time to call up reinforcements from the northern tribes. - How long? - Until tomorrow. Very well. I'll return to Sura. We need more reinforcement on the ramparts. Hurry. Everybody. Zereteli's gone. He may have escaped using the underground passages. I'll go find him. Quickly. Hurry! Defend yourself, Zereteli. I am here to avenge my people and the Great Khan! Seize him! Don't kill me, Ursus, don't kill me. I will serve as your slave the restof my life, but don't kill me. You must pay for your murders and for stealing the throne. Did Aniko tell you all that? I'll tell you another thing. She is not the daughter of the Great Khan. The real Aniko was wounded that terrible night and because I was afraid she would die, I senther away. Kato... Kato is the daughter of the Great Khan. I saved her life. And she'll rule. Speak! There was no trace of Aniko here. Where is she? How do you expectme to know where she is? Where? She's waiting for you like a dog. She's trapped in the Grotto of the Falcon. Lock him up! - And Ursus? - He left a few minutes ago. - Where did he go? - To the Grotto of the Falcon to free Aniko. No! I'll attend to Zereteli when I get back. But first I must stop Ursus. Follow me! Ursus! You've returned. You came to save me. Zereteli knows everything. We must flee. He can't do anything to us. He's my prisoner. He assassinated the Great Khan. He confessed it. And many other things. You are not the true heir to the throne. Forgive me, Ursus. Don't blame me for any of this. I was taken to the palace as a child and taughtonly what Zereteli wanted me to think. But I did not know of his crimes. I only know that I love you. By helping you, I am redeemed. Now you are the master of Sura. Nobody knows the truth about me. I will reign at your side not as a queen, but as a wife. That can't be. The real daughter of the Great Khan has been found. Kato is the true Princess Aniko. The throne is hers by right. Will you marry her? I don't know... not yet. You muststay with me. Do not forsake me. You've always loved me. - What's wrong, Ursus? - This is nothing. I'll take care of it. Drink some wine. Drink. And lie down and rest. Get some rest. You'll go back to her, Ursus. But not to marry her. But to kill her. Because you love killing. Don't you, monster? Go! Go and kill Kato. Throw her from the precipice. Tear her heart out. Make sure that you leave no trace. Go, go, monster, go! From here, I will guide your steps once again. Go. Look! The monster attacked Miko. The monster captured Kato and set fire to the woods. Ride hard to the palace and bring back every available man. Continue the search, I'm going to the Grotto. Yes... You are the monster. You are my slave. Yes, a horrible monster. You must obey me! Stop it, Aniko! Stop it, witch! Stop it or I'll kill you. No, Ursus is mine. Only mine! Aniko! Where are you, Aniko? Stop it, Aniko! Stop it! Ursus is mine. My demon of evil! No one could ever take him away from me. My plan was perfect: I'd have with me not a man, but a zombie with terrible powers who would carry out my every desire. There'd be no danger to me nor to my reign. No enemy could oppose me. There'd be no Zereteli or Yio in my way. No one and nothing could stand against the monster I made of Ursus. With my magic and his strength, I would have had the world at my feet. Ursus would have lived by my side forever never suspecting his crimes. Aniko, you've got to stop this! Aniko! I know you made me into the monster that attacked Ursus. And that you made Frido try to kill me. I know the power of your witchcraft is contained in that leather flask. Aniko... Don't force me to. Kato... In the name of the gods, what's happened? Ursus... Come. Let's go. Ursus, I know who I am, I remember everything. I also know your kingdom awaits you. It's Ursus! It's Ursus. You saved Kato. Ursus has freed us, he killed monster. Yes, but don't look for its body. It was consumed in the forest fire.
