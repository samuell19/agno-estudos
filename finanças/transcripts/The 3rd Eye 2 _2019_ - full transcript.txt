Have you ever asked yourself why were you born into this world? What are you here for? Who are you living for? With all the advantages and disadvantages that God gave you... should we be grateful? Or should we be sad? For us, the third eye that God gave us at first felt like a curse. But now, we are able to accept it as a blessing to help those in need. We've become a bridge between two worlds, helping restless souls. We-- my sister and I, with our open third eyes, we are there for them. You are the handler of souls that are living. You are the handler of souls that are dead. You are the owner of our world and their world. Bring her to me. Mirah. I invite you into this circle. Abel. What are you doing? Trying to communicate with Mirah. For what? To find out why she is still in our world. And why she keeps following you from school to our home. It's been a year, Bel. And for what? Have you done it yet? I have tried everything but I still can't get to her. Mrs. Windu said she wanted something from us. Have you gotten anything? I'm gonna go to sleep. Water is a calm medium. We can focus our third eye under water to help see the future. 1. PREPARE ENOUGH WATER TO SUBMERGE IN. 2. STAY IN THE WATER FOR 10-20 MINUTES. 3. RELAX YOUR MIND. Help! Abel! Abel! Abel, open the door! Abel! Abel! Abel! Abel! Abel, wake up. Open your eyes! Bel, can you hear me? Abel! Mirah. What did you do to Abel? Abel... Abel... Bel. What you experienced is called psychometry. It is the ability to read the history of an object just by touching it. It's because in each object, there is always a record of the events that happened around it which comes from the energy of people or other objects surrounding it. This necklace must have something to do with the house I saw. Yes, but you need to stop thinking about it. You've been searching for months about the origins of that necklace and the house, but you haven't found anything. And you can't communicate with Mirah. FOR SALE Mrs. Windu, I am sure that the necklace and the house are related to Mirah. And it can reveal the truth behind Abel's death and why Mirah killed her. Alia. It's nice that you are moving on with your life now. Help the children at the orphanage as you try to find yourself. SOCIAL WORK PROPOSAL PUTRI KIRANA ORPHANAGE Stick to the plan and start a new phase in your life, Alia. Yes, ma'am. I will stick to my plan. Because the only place for me right now is an orphanage. A place for people without families. But I will still try to find out what actually happened to Abel. Alia, with your third eye, it means you can go into the other world with no limits. But you have to be careful. Don't do something stupid just because of your anger and feelings of revenge towards Mirah. PUTRI KIRANA ORPHANAGE Good afternoon. Afternoon, sir. I'm Alia, I'm doing social work here. I talked to Mrs. Laksmi on the phone. Oh! Right. Mrs. Laksmi is waiting in the back yard. Let me take you there. Alia. This is Alia, the one who called yesterday. Oh, right, welcome to our orphanage. I'm Laksmi and this is Fadli, my husband. I'm gonna go back to work. - All right. - Okay. Let's go. Yeah, okay. My parents left this house to me. It was too big for me so we turned it into an orphanage. This orphanage runs purely from donations and Mr. Fadli's income. Our biggest donors were our parents. I'm so sorry for just finding out about this orphanage from my parents' documents. No, it's okay. We are so thankful that you have a big heart just like your parents. Especially since our last volunteer quit yesterday. We have 16 children here-- all of them are girls, and all of them sleep upstairs. Mr. Fadli and I stay at the left wing of this house. Okay? - Okay. - Let's go. We have several rooms here. Let me take you downstairs. This is the TV room. Ma'am, the TV keeps turning off. Yes, and the fan, too. Gosh. Okay, tomorrow Mr. Fadli will repair them. Oh? Rayya, come here. Rayya. Oh...? - It's cold. - Is it? Ooh. You're burning up. Tsk. You should stop playing and have a rest upstairs. You play so hard like a boy. Now go and rest. Say, "Excuse me." Okay. It's quite chilly here. Hmm. I'll let Mr. Fadli know. Let's go. Nadia is strange. Nadia? She kept hiding in the closet last night. She said she heard something scary. Something scary? I don't know what it is. I didn't hear anything. Is it possible that it is the sound of something that we cannot see? Like what? Hmm? Sweetheart, those things do not exist. Okay? They don't. Don't be scared. Go do your homework. It's been two weeks since Nadia moved in. She is a little weird. She is always alone and feeling scared. Scared? Maybe she is still getting over her trauma. Her family died because of a landslide. The social services brought her here. - Hey, be careful when you play! - I'm sorry, ma'am. - Don't break things! - I'm sorry. What's in that book? She never shows it to the other kids. Nothing, just drawings. All right, you take that book back to Nadia. And try getting to know the other children, okay? This happens a lot. It's okay. Let's go. We are a family here and you are going to be a part of this family. When can you start? Today? Ah, good, good. Once you're done unpacking, please help me with dinner. And then please get a room ready for Nadia. She has been sleeping with Rayya and Malika. She's big enough to have her own room, right? - Right, ma'am. - Ah! This is your room. Hi, Nadia. I'm Alia. This will be your new room. Mrs. Laksmi said you are now big enough to sleep by yourself. Uh... you left this earlier. You draw a lot of... them. I can see them, too. You're just like my sister, Abel. She had an open third eye just like you. Come here. When did you start seeing them? Since I was little. And after you draw them... what do you do? I just draw them to get rid of the image I have in my mind. Have you ever seen them here? No. But I hear voices. What voices? It's on the last page. HELP SET ME FREE That's what I heard. From the walls of this house. Come here. Come here. Nadia. I'M LOCKED IN. I JUST WANT TO GO TO MY WORLD. I heard it again. From the walls. Help! Help me! Behind you. Over there. Nadia. Come here. Come here. Come here. Did you send the message through these walls? Knock once for yes, twice for no. Do you know where the key is? Whose room is this? Weird. Let's go. You go ahead. Bye! Bye. I think you caught it from Rayya. Go sleep in your room. I've made your bed. I'll bring you food and medicine. Hi, ma'am! Rayya. Rayya! Come in here. Come in, come in. Here. Let me see. You still have a fever and you're still playing around. What if you get worse and can't go to school? And you moved my plates. Didn't you? I didn't move your plates. When you're healthy again, I will have you clean up all the bathrooms in this house. Huh? - But... - You already know. I don't like liars. Right? But I wasn't lying. I didn't move the plates. - Alia. - Yes? Can you take her to her room? - Give her pills for Malika, too. - Yes, ma'am. Why doesn't Mrs. Laksmi believe me? Malika, wait there! Now get some sleep and don't leave your room, okay? Okay. Who is it? Malika! What are you doing here? Why can't I be here? Aren't you gonna get pills from Alia? Ew! No, I'd rather hide. Where did you get that camera? From one of the boxes that Alia brought here. Tsk. I only got a yo-yo. Malika, drink your medicine. Malika? Come out and drink your medicine. It's tasty, orange-flavored. Malika, if you drink your medicine I will give you a present. Malika, let go! Malika! Malika! Malika! Hey! Help! Please leave me alone! Go away! Leave me alone! Go away! - What's wrong? - It's Nadia. Let's go. Nadia? Did you cause this mess? No, it wasn't me. If not you, then who? Nadia, you know the rules in this house. If it's your fault, then say so. Don't lie. - Alia. - I didn't cause this mess! - Let's get out. - Ma'am! Please open the door! Tidy up your room. Ma'am, please open the door. Poor Nadia, she's still sick. This is how I educate them. They are punished if they lie. She will get lunch and medicine, but after that I will lock her in her room. And leave her there until morning comes. No dinner for her. Nadia? Please believe me. I didn't cause this mess. Yes, you can talk to me. Who did it? A little child. A girl. Hey, hey. What is wrong with you two? Who entered the room just then? Was it Malika? Then why are you both scared like this? I accidentally took a picture of this. Alia? Nadia? You're awake? I'm scared. You don't have to be scared or worried. I'll try and communicate with the little girl. To find out what she wants. I'll come with you! You're sick, you should rest. But I can't sleep. I might be able to help you. My teacher says that we could communicate with the other world using a mirror. But I need help from the energy of someone with a third eye, too. Don't be scared, Nadia. We're stronger than them. Close your eyes. But don't leave your mind empty. And remember, don't look at the mirror until we finish the ritual. You are the handler of souls that are living. You are the handler of souls that are dead. You are the owner of our world and their world. Allow me to talk with she who is here. Through this mirror. Without boundaries. Did you call me? Are you the one we freed last night? - Yes. - Who are you? Did you live here? Yes. What's your name? Darmah. Darmah. We freed you. You can go back to your world. Why are you still here? Why are you still haunting us? To find out. To find out what? I am here, and you can help me. How can we help you? - Darmah? - The truth. The truth? What truth? Darmah, what truth? What did she mean by truth? - Fadli. Fadli! - What's wrong, Laksmi? Why is Rayya awake? I'll check on her. Rayya. Go back to sleep. Rayya? Honey. Let's go to sleep. Look at the time. What if you catch a cold again? Rayya? AUNTIE - Fadli! - What? Darmah is here! - No way. - Darmah is here. Get out. Get out, quickly! - Open up! - Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Open up, Fadli! Fadli! Fadli! Open up! Fadli! Wait by the stairs! - Ma'am, what's wrong? - Get something to break this open. Anything! - Fadli! - Move over, ma'am! Fadli! - Fadli. - Sir! Fadli, are you all right? - Are you okay? - Ma'am, what is actually happening? Are you all right? Let's get out. Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Up, up, up! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Do not leave this room until I say so. - Alia, keep an eye on them! - Yes, ma'am! Calm down, everyone. - What's happening? - It's all right, calm down. Come sit here. Sit down. Everyone, come this way! Everyone, come this way! Come on, let's go! Everyone listen to me. Wait here and don't leave this room! I believe that the power I behold is within me. Ah! - Someone opened the door. - Impossible. Nobody can open this door. I know what's happening here is not normal. There is something in this house. And I am sure you both know that. Malika took this photo by accident. And we've been communicating with that girl. You opened the door? Listen. Only people with an opened third eye can communicate with her... and open that door. You both made a huge mistake. But why did you have to lock her in there? She has been tortured, locked up in that room. She couldn't go to her world. Darmah... Darmah is my niece. My sister's daughter. She was like my own. She lived here, too. Three years ago, when Mr. Fadli and I came home... we found them murdered. A robbery. Our lives were never the same. Darmah and her mother's spirit always came to haunt us. Mr. Fadli has an open third eye. He tried to get rid of them but he couldn't. So he locked up the room. But her mother was able to escape. Mr. Fadli also built a fence around the house so that none of the spirits can get inside-- not even her mother. I don't know. I don't know why they keep haunting us. What did we ever do wrong? Huh? Okay, then. We have to lock the room. And put her in there. We must. But, sir, locking Darmah in won't solve all of this. If she's out now and still haunting us that means there is something else she wants to tell us. Yesterday she mentioned something about "the truth." - What truth? - What truth? We need to find out what she means. That way, she can be done with everything. And she can go to her world. But how. How? Psychometry. I don't know how else to tell you this. It is hard for us to talk face to face. I'm sorry, I can't hide this secret any longer. Laksmi has to know. Even Darmah has to know that you are Darmah's father. That I didn't get pregnant because of my boyfriend who ran away. I'm asking for your willingness, Fadli. What are you writing? Nothing, my dear. Let's go. I'll play with you. - Really? - Yes. - Can we play in the garden? - Let's go, sweetie. Mom, let's take my doll, too. Alia? What's wrong, Laksmi? It's my sister's writing. Mirah. Laksmi. Laksmi... Laksmi. Laksmi! Nadia? Why are you still awake? Is it really over? The truth is out. Is that all? Alia. My little sister died... because she was killed by a spirit named Mirah. And... I found this necklace in her pocket. I don't know who it belongs to. But what I do know from my observations is that this necklace has something to do with a woman named Mirah. And this house. We now know that Mirah is Mrs. Laksmi's sister. But I still don't understand. Why did Mirah have to kill my sister? Mrs. Laksmi said Mr. Fadli built a fence around the house, so that Darmah's mother couldn't come here. That means it's impossible for you to meet Mirah or to communicate with her here if that is what you want to help you solve the death of your sister. But maybe her daughter, Darmah-- maybe she can help you reveal the truth about your sister's death. Alia. Could there be more than one truth? And what if we haven't discovered all of them? Is Darmah going to keep haunting us? I CAN'T HIDE THIS SECRET ANY LONGER Dad! Dad! Dad. - Who is it? - I think it's Mr. Fadli. What? Sir? Mr. Fadli? Darmah. Darmah is still here. Fadli. We all know the truth. What else are you hiding from us? What else? Laksmi? Alia? Nadia? Laksmi... Fadli! Alia? - Laksmi? Laksmi? - Over here, Fadli. Here! Alia? Alia! - Alia? - Over here, sir. Nadia? Nadia! Nadia, are you all right? Nadia. What's wrong, Nadia? Nadia! Nadia? Fadli? Fadli. Ma'am! - Fadli? - Mrs. Laksmi. Fadli? Mr. Fadli? - Mr. Fadli? - Fadli. - Mr. Fadli? - Fadli? Dad will know how painful this is. Nadia, help! Fadli! Mrs. Laksmi! Mrs. Laksmi! Get a rope! Quick! Dad, you will know how painful it feels to be murdered. Kill you! Mr. Fadli is possessed by Darmah's spirit. What steps have you taken? I've tied him up. The wraith energy is strong. I think she's angry because Mr. Fadli didn't acknowledge her as his daughter until after her death. She's possessing him to kill him, to get revenge. I'm on my way. When I get there, I will open the portal to the other world. And we will forcefully send Darmah there. But I still have to communicate with Darmah. - There is one more thing I need-- - Do not get close to Mr. Fadli. It's extremely dangerous. If you want to know the truth, use another method. Remember what I taught you. Using the third eye can also be done through paintings. And don't forget. If things get worse, use the necklace I gave you. - It has a spell that can protect you. - Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Windu is on her way here to help us. But I need your help, Nadia. People with a third eye who have talent in painting do not just paint to illustrate what they see and to free their mind of the souls they see. They can also use their talent to find out more about those spirits. Dig deeper into your third eye. Don't be scared. Stay focused. I ask for Your protection. You who nurture and control the two worlds. Show us the dimension of Your creation. Show us... things that we have never seen before. Are you out of your mind? I can't bear keeping this secret any longer! Listen. I don't want my marriage to Laksmi to be ruined. I don't want her to get hurt. - Do you understand? - But how? Darmah keeps asking me who her real father is. I ask you... to keep this a secret, do you understand? If you don't care about me then I won't care about you, either. Darmah and Laksmi, they have to know! Mom! Why are you here, huh? Shrimp is fine, too. Mirah! Darmah! Who did this? Impossible. Fadli would never do this. He didn't want to lose you. Dad will die, just like Mom and me. Don't! Don't! Nadia! Why did you do that? Why did you do that to Nadia? Don't ever try getting in my way of killing Dad. Or I will kill someone. Darmah, anger and revenge have consumed you! You need to end this! We hate the same person-- Abel's murderer. Your mom killed Abel. Your mom killed my sister. It wasn't my mom. My mom didn't kill her. The killer... is Dad! Alia! The necklace! Alia. Alia. Let's take him inside. To a place where we can control Darmah and not the other way around. Shifa. Shifa! Mrs. Laksmi! Nadia! Mrs. Laksmi! Nadia! - Shifa, call an ambulance. Now! - Nadia! - Here. Put pressure here. - Nadia! You gave Darmah room to attack and control the situation, Alia. Abel's killer. Abel's killer. Abel's killer! Never trust the words of an angry spirit. They can trick our minds. Abel's killer. Abel's killer. - Abel's killer. - Alia, focus! I will open the portal. I am not lying. I'm telling the truth. If Dad can kill his daughter and the mother of his daughter, then he can kill Abel, too. Because Abel knows who killed us. Dad is scared that people will find out. Alia, stay focused! Alia, don't look into his eyes. Mirah, what do you want? Mirah, what do you want? DIED TRUTH, FREE MY DAUGHTER, LEAVE PEACE You should set her free and turn yourself in to the police. How dare you set foot in my house? Never tell anyone about this. Don't ever come back here. You want to help her? Don't you dare! Go back to your world. If you don't, I will make Darmah suffer like her! Abel, open the door! Bel? Abel! Abel... Abel? Abel! Abel. Abel, open your eyes. Do you still want to stop me? You still want me to stop torturing him? I will take him with me. I will torture him. Dad will come with me. Yes, you deserve to be angry. You deserve to feel anger, Alia. Come with me. We'll finish him. Alia! Can you hear me? Alia! Alia! Come back! Don't listen to Darmah! Alia. Alia. Alia, can you hear me? Alia. Nadia. Hang in there. Nadia. Nadia! Stay with us! She's still breathing. Shifa! The ambulance is on its way! Come here. Be with her. Nadia. Nadia! Nadia, stay with us! Alia! Alia. Fadli? I'm Windu, Alia's spiritual teacher. Darmah has taken Alia and Fadli to her world. They are unconscious. If we leave them for too long, they will die. What do we do? Bring them back. We have to get them. By going to the other world. Astral projection. - How? - I will open the portal to another world. And I have to stay here to make sure none of the evil spirits enter our world. But I need someone with a third eye to go there and bring them back. Nadia. Nadia could do it, but she's hurt. Those who are physically weak cannot do it. If you want, I can open your third eye. And you can go get Alia and Fadli. I don't have the guts to do it. You should find someone else. There is no time left. You are the only one who can do this. And you can't go alone. Someone should go with you. Someone with the same energy as the other world, but who is still in our world. Who? I can invite some of the spirits to come here and ask them to help. But something is holding them back from this house. Fadli. Fadli built a fence around this house. It goes around the house without a gap. I have evacuated the children to a safer place. You will begin to feel their presence. Smell their odor... and hear their voices. Put your hands on your chest. Close your eyes. Take a deep breath slowly and focus on the center of your forehead. Open your eyes. Who is it? Who are you? Ma'am... Nadia? Nadia! Nadia! You? Why are you here? Why? Wake up. Nadia, wake up! Nadia! Wake up! Nadia! Wake up, Nadia! Wake up, Nadia! I'm so sorry. I know this is hard. But we have to save Alia and Mr. Fadli as soon as possible. I have tried communicating with the spirits. None of them are willing to accompany you to the other world. Only Nadia can help you. No. Don't. Not you. - Not Nadia. - Ma'am... maybe this is my fate. I'm okay. We should save Alia and Mr. Fadli. You have to hold hands to make sure you have the same energy. Don't let go. Or they will recognize Laksmi there. And you will not be able to return to this world. Don't let go. It's gonna be okay. Focus. Laksmi, you should go back to this point. Nadia, you can go to the afterworld there in front of you. That is where the evil spirits are. They are there. Ma'am, let's go. Fadli. Fadli. Alia. Alia! - Alia! - Are you all right? Alia, are you okay? Fadli! Leave him here. He killed my sister. He needs to suffer. He has to suffer here forever! Alia. Abel? Abel! Why are you here? You shouldn't be here! Those who are in heaven can come down here. But what is down here can't come up to heaven. I came here for you. You have to forgive Mr. Fadli and accept my death. Revenge is a vicious circle. Once you have your revenge, other bad things will consume you. Envy, lust, greed. Life will never be peaceful again. Bel. He killed you. He has been so evil! Mr. Fadli. I forgive you. Don't let us become the same as those who are evil. How are we different from them if you do? All evil starts with revenge. Thank you. Thank you. Ma'am! You will all die! Darmah! Stop, honey. Come here. Mirah. Mirah. You have to go back. You too. You still have a second chance. You have been so brave using your third eye this far. Many people need you. The world needs people with a third eye to help them face evil spirits that haunt them. I will always love you, Abel. I love you, too. Always. If there is no anger and revenge, we can go to heaven. We can play like we used to. They all know the truth. It is over now, sweetie. Laksmi, free me. Hurry, press it. Hurry! Are you all right? Let's go. Come on! Dad! Dad! Let's go. - Darmah! Darmah! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! - Darmah. Darmah! - Dad! Dad! Dad! Darmah! Darmah! Dad, don't go! Dad! Don't go! Mr. Fadli! You guys go ahead! Let's go, ma'am. Sir, let's go. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad, don't run! Don't run away! Nadia. Nadia! She's awake! Nadia. Hang in there, the ambulance is coming. Fadli? Fadli. Fadli. Laksmi. Thank you, Laksmi. Alia. Alia! Alia! Alia! Dad! Dad! Dad. Don't run... Mrs. Windu! Ma'am. Remember when you killed me with this? Fadli! Alia! Fadli? Alia! Alia! Dad. Alia! Alia! Alia! - Wait here. - Alia, what are you doing? I'm sorry. Forgive me. Eh? Eh? You're sorry? I'm sorry. Please forgive me! Are you apologizing because you are sorry, or because you know you're about to die? I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Are you sorry for killing Mom? Are you sorry for killing me? Do you know what it feels like to be killed? What it feels like to die? Alia. Alia! Alia! Alia! Mrs. Laksmi, help me! Alia. Alia. Hey. You are all going to die! You didn't have a choice in what you experienced. But you chose to be consumed with hatred and revenge. This is no longer your place. You belong in hell, with all evil beings! Go to your world! A demon like you should suffer forever in hell! No! Let me go! No! No! No! Alia...? - Alia. - Alia. Alia. Sweetie? No matter how hard you try to keep bad secrets, they will eventually be revealed. I'm sorry, my sister. The truth will always be told no matter what. Evil will not be conquered with evil, but with kindness. It takes a big heart to forgive lies and betrayal. Anger and revenge will have no end unless there is forgiveness. Come in. - There's a delivery for you. - Yes, thank you. Alia, I have officially adopted Nadia. I just have to wait for the documents. Nadia will be delighted, ma'am. Nadia! Read it. Yes. Alia. Ma'am. I invited Mrs. Windu here so you and Nadia can learn more about the third eye. Oh, okay. All right, I'll go make some tea. - Thank you. - Just a second. Let's go. Alia, I need to tell you something. That night when Darmah possessed you, I had to close the portal. But I was too late. What do you mean? An evil spirit entered our world. If they know there is a portal to our world, they will try to get in. Let's play! Come on! Who's there?
