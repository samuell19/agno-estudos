But Hee-soon's grades dropped 20%. I was wondering if there's a problem at home... No, there's no problem... Of course not. Do we have to meet and talk like this? But Hee-soon wasn't like this at the start of the term. She was a great student. But she's absent often and... She skipped school? Mr. Kim may I see you for a sec? ... to talk? Where are you going? Just some place quieter to talk. Will you come with me, sir? Hon? Teachers' Washroom I don't really run a wholesale shop. No, thank you. I don't smoke. - You don't? - No. Night clubs. You know, bars and clubs? I supply stuff to clubs. I see. - How old are you? - Excuse me? You look a few years younger than me. She's hit puberty and needs more attention... But it's not easy being a father... Of course it's not, sir. That's right! So will you keep an eye on her? Yes, of course. You're a great teacher. I'll take you out for drinks some time. And this is nothing much but... No. Please, sir. - Just take it. - Don't do this, sir. Just accept it. I like you, Let's meet for drinks some time. Ah... Mr. Kang! You think I don't know you're doing this on purpose? Think this'll get you to Canada? Why can't I go, but Min-chul can! Why that little... It's your fault for spoiling her. It's not her fault! Don't talk like that to mom! Why you! You can't talk like that to your dad! Stop! What a crazy driver! What's the matter? He's so crazy one. Mr. Paek is hurt pretty bad. And I can't understand what he's saying. Why not? Again, slower. What? Forget it. No idea what he's saying. He's messed up bad. He's hurt bad and no one can understand what he's saying. I think we lost the contract. Dae-chang construction deal is gone. We can't start a war. What if they go crazy and attack? I'll go and try to find out what they're up to. Wake up man. In-gu! Get up! I need more sleep. Give me a smoke. Buy some for a change, man. If I do, I can't quit. You're a Jaguar alright. Get some clothes man. That's all you got, isn't it? Cut the chit chat. Going around stabbing people's backs... What? You know how cheap that is, man? You called me out to bitch, man? Hand the contract over. No way, bud. Nice weather. But you're the one who turned on me. Why'd you hide Mr. Paek? We agreed to split the Dae-chang deal. But who got to him at the end and tried to take the whole thing? Your boss, man. Look at you, how embarrassing. Why you little... I told you not to talk bad about my boss! You little piece of shit. Fine. Forget it. Let's go eat. Changing subjects... You pay this time, bud! You two were always together fighting ever since you were young. We don't fight. We're brothers. You fools. I'll get you more sausages. A double helping, please. What was her daughter's name? The pretty one? Jung-sook, right? Aw, man. Stop it. You liked her so much you camped out here everyday, remember? Stop it. She married a mailman and you almost killed yourself. I said stop it! Shit, man. Come on man. Put 'em up! Try me! Are you okay, man? You okay, bud? Refreshing, huh? - Stop fighting! - Let's drop it. The fools... Splashing water on me when I'm eating... How's Jung-sook doing? Pretty good. - Hyun-su's dying to know. - Man, stop it. You know when she got married Hyun-su tried to... Those idiots... That hit the spot. Hey, In-gu. Give the contract back before things get out of hand. What do you mean? It's a done deal. Think of your wife and kids. How will they live if you get hurt? Are you threatening me? Yeah. Thanks for breakfast, man. Happy birthday boss! Happy birthday bro. I heard you lost a lot of money. Why can't you ever do anything right? They're saying that I'm easy on you 'cuz you're my brother. In-gu took care of the Dae-chang deal. So don't go around doing anything more stupid. Can I go now? Happy birthday, bro. In-gu's always in my way. Realtors What kind of homes are you looking for? Well I heard there's a lot of nice houses around here. Pardon me, but may I ask where you live now, sir? - Now? - Yes. - Why? - I mean... Ah... in Kangnam. How big is the place, sir? Around 2000 square feet. It's a good neighborhood here to live for families. Men who can afford it come here to see. Look, aren't they lovely homes? Wow... there really are homes like this? They're like homes in the west. Where's this? My wife and kids will love it. I'm sure they will, sir. They'll go nuts if I bring 'em to a place like this. Look. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, In-gu! Hi there, Sang-jin. - It's been awhile. - Yeah. Good to see you Jin-ho. How've you been, sir? We should get together more often. I haven't seen you since Sang-chul went in to the hospital, right? They said he had 3 months. But he lasted only 2, huh? I heard you did good on the Dae-chang deal. Well, the boss helped me a lot. - That's great, congrats man. - Thanks. The boss should be here by now... I don't wanna say this to you... but things are hard these days. I'm in a little rut right now so... Where's my cut on the deal? You know how it is, man. After paying the boss and my boys, there's not much left. I don't think you understand, man. What? You have to give me a cut. I'm ranked above you, man. You should give it to me even before I ask. Look, Sang-jin. I've had enough, man. You can't ask for anything. You didn't do a thing. I sold fruit for 4 years, man. Let's just drop it. Why you little... You bastard... - In-gu. - Yes, sir. - Haven't seen you much. - Yes... - Sorry for not helping much. - No, boss. Go on in. First, I'll have to change. You look okay, bro. Just go on in. - Come with me In-gu. - Yes, sir. You did good on the Dae-chang deal. Thank you, sir. Construction is a tough field. It won't be easy. But I'm sure you'll do well. I'll ask for help if I need it, sir. Good. And by the way... Take care of your health. Young ones dying like this, it's sad. I'm still young, boss. You should watch your health too, sir. Can you tie this for me? I'm not good but... Isn't this great? # Dark grey... - Hello. - Why are you banging on the door?

Why is she... - What did you give to her teacher? - What? What did you give him! Money. You know he called us in for it. That way he'll be nicer to her. - It's not about the money! - Then what?

You always say that. It's been 10 years! You get hit and hurt all the time! You can't even fight anymore. It's not like I wanna do this. I'm scared that I'll go out and get stabbed everyday. But we don't have any money. I have to support Min-chul in Canada. And Hee-soon wants to study abroad, too. But what if you get hurt and can't move? You expect me to wipe the shit off your ass for you? Forget it. I'll just run away! They look pretty young. What's the matter between them? Go on. Watch TV. Read your paper. People... Never seen a couple fight before? Hon? I'm sorry. Now you're talking. I'm not taking this just for me. After handing it out to my crew, I won't have much left.

Look around, sir. I bet it's the perfect house for you. Every room gets plenty of sunshine and has the garden view. Any room would be perfect for your kids. There's even a small balcony. This is good. This is the best room with windows on two sides. - It gets a nice breeze. - This is great. It'd be perfect for my daughter. That room's for my son when he comes home on vacations. This is a great room. - How's the water here? - Water, sir? It's gotta come out good. - Of course it does, sir. - Oh, it does well. You know for showers and stuff. - I'll take it. - Good. - I'll make a down payment. - Great. I'll pay the rest at the end of the month and move in then. That's great, sir. I'm sure you won't regret it. Houses are built good these days... - Hey, mister. - Long time no see. - Give me two beef dumplings. - Sorry, I just ran out. But I have kimchi dumplings left.

Fine, then I guess you know. Yeah, I hope you die! I want you gone! Hee-soon... You want your dad to die... - What are you doing? - Then I should die. Where's the knife? Don't you dare! Rather than getting stabbed by some punk. It's better to get stabbed by my daughter. I'd be happier that way. Here, kill me. Hee-soon! You said you wanted me dead! Mom... pick up... But she's my daughter... We were just talking... - We started arguing... - Right... - Why do I have to go to the station? - It's just procedure. - Let's just go and talk there. - But ah...

She has to come, too. - Wait 'till your mom comes home. - Let's go. But you still shouldn't have picked up a knife. That's not it, man. I was just so frustrated... Come on... How many times do I have to say it? Hello, this is Sadang Police box. Is there drunken guy? Where are you? 871? OK, I got it. In-gu Kang? When did you move here? Don't know. Don't remember.

You wanna go to jail again? What were you thinking? Get out. Let's not do this. I'm tired. You bastard. I said drop it. Remember when you hit someone on my birthday at the shop? What are you talking about? Hee-soon said she was there and saw you beating him up. What? You go around hitting people so much, you don't even remember? The stupid manager at the club. It was 'cuz he didn't pay... She's in shock. She says she has nightmares about you beating people up. It's enough that my life's ruined 'cuz of you. I want out.

You're watching News Nine. Now for our first report. This afternoon, a fight broke lose at a 711 store. The suspected gangsters had fought using weapons. Here's Jung-won Choi with the report. A man in his 40's who is in charge of an apartment complex construction... Went into a store and was attacked by strangers. As Kang ran into the streets, the attackers followed swinging knives. Three citizens were injured in the incident. Upon police investigation, Kang was found to be a gangster of the Dogs. Choi, arrested at the scene, is found to be from the rival Jaguars gang. Police suspect it was due to a fight... Mom! Between the gangs over the right to a reconstruction site. But Kang is persistently denying it. I just went in to buy some smokes. The police are investigating the case... And searching for 2 men who escaped the scene. Recently, gangs have been fighting out in the open Swinging weapons around in the middle of the city. But police are still trying to find out what's behind the fights. Boss, he's coming. In-gu! Greet me properly, punk. What are you doing here? Of course, I should be here. Looks like you'll have to come here several times. And I heard it's not easy pleading self-defense. Shit. What are you going to do with the Jaguars? Screw 'em down. But let's wait for the right time. - Let's go. - Yes, sir. You live in Noryang-jin, right? I'm sorry to have to tell you this right now but... You're off the Dae-chang deal. What? Being on the news, you know the police will be all over you. So? I think you should stay low for awhile. Shit. What the hell are you saying? But I made the whole deal, man. You're just taking over? Is that it? That's not what's important here, man. Then what is! What if we're all investigated and go down? Did the boss decide this? Are you underestimating me? I can make decisions like this. Stop the car. I said stop! Stop the car. The fuckin' Jaguars... I don't believe this... Please leave a message after the beep. - It's the realtors. - Hello? - We didn't get your next payment. - Yes... I'm sorry. I forgot... You have 2 days to pay, sir. I'll pay before then. I won't break the contract. I'll pay. I have to have that house. Yes, thank you. I need to get out like this sometimes. Or I'll go crazy. In-gu... Wanna travel or go hunting with me and rest for a year or so? I know... You worked hard but there's no choice. I have to make my payment tomorrow. But he takes me off the Dae-chang deal... And gives me this for my health? Shit... Ow, my hand... Perfect fit. - Hyun-su! Where are you? - Hello? In-gu? - Hello? Hello? - Can't hear you. Like hell you can't! Where are you, bastard? Hello? Come out right now! You son of bitch! How dare you... Stay there. Wait! Wait! Wait! Son of bitch. Come out here. Here, look at this. Shit, what is it? You idiot... You beat up my old junker even more. Shit. You know who that is? We saw the news and started doing our own search just in case. Good picture, huh? It's true, he's our man. But he left us a long time ago. This guy... Jin-ho probably found him and paid him off. But you think Jin-ho can do this on his own? There's someone behind him. Hey! What the hell? You come here, you bastard. Boss! Hey, come on, man. - Come here. - What? What's wrong? You set me up! How dare you! Can't be on the 9 o'clock news, my ass! You piece of shit! In-gu! What are you doing? Boss, the bastard, he... No, I... I just... What are you doing? Are you crazy? I'm sorry, sir. In-gu Kang. In-gu! In-gu! What happened? Answer me! You think you can still stay there? Chief Roh and his brother... They're taking all the pie, man. Come over to our side. Shit, don't you remember 10 years ago? When I got stabbed and didn't have money for surgery? We had to sell our house. I asked you for $1000 to help find an apartment. But you avoided me for a month. Why do you always bring that up? I took my young kids... And went into an old, smelly motel. You bastard. My wife and I, we cried, you bastard. But you know who got us a place then? My boss. He got us a place with two rooms. He said the extra room's for the kids. I'm sorry about that man, but I still don't have a house. Kiss my ass, bastard. Sang-jin is lucky he has a brother like my boss. - Mom? - What? Look, over there. What are you doing here? Wasn't sure if it was the right place. I haven't been here in so long. Is this your mom's new car? It's cute. Go on in first. Your father and I have to talk. It's okay. Why'd you come? Well, I should come and greet your mom once in a while. You know my mom hates you. I'm hungry. Did you eat? Fine, let's go eat. Get in. This is good. You come to Jeju island and you want to eat noodles? I craved the noodles here all the time. It's been 20 years, huh? We came here often when we first met, remember? It's good that you're here. Huh? I want a divorce. What? Not again. No way. I'm living like this for our family. You really think it's for us? You know how hard it's on me and Hee-soon. We can't talk about this on the phone. Let's meet. I come all the way down here and you keep me cooped up in a motel? Come on. I'm out of it now. Believe me. I'm finished with them. What else do you want me to say? Yeah, I'm a gangster. You knew that. Did you marry me thinking I worked at some big company? You lived off the money I made from the gang. All those years, you were okay with it. But now you want a divorce? You didn't let me work, to take care of the kids. I never once felt right about spending the money you brought home. Suddenly turned saint... But still, you can't do this to me, hon. Not you. You know how I lived all those years. Shit, you can't do this to me, hon. You don't even greet me anymore? How are you feeling? You crazy bastard. It's stuffy in here. Let's talk outside. Let's get some fresh air boys. Got your knife? Stay close. I want to quit everything. It got tiring in my old age. I'm asking for one last favor. The wholesale produce... I want to keep doing that. But I'll drop everything I had anywhere else. I don't have anything else to do at this age. I need something to feed my family. Why are you telling me this? Go tell my brother. I think it'd be best for everyone if you and I clear things between us. I don't want the boss to worry about this any longer. Okay, fine. Thanks. You take care, man. Hey, In-gu! Still think I'm some mutt? Huh? You bastard! You piece of shit! You bastard! Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! Boss! Come out! - Come here! - Get him out of there! Let me go! You bastard! Boss! In-gu! Open the door! You bastard! In-gu! Open the door! - Open up! - Parking stub please. I have a patient here. Hurry up! - Hurry. - $3 please. Shit. Here. $7 is your change. Shit, open the gate now! You piece of shit. Hello? Hyun-su! Hyun-su! Send me your boys, now! The hell are you talking about? Send me some men! I'm eating man. Shit, I'm serious! I got Sang-jin and I'm in deep shit. What the hell? I have Sang-jin in my hands. What are you going to do? I'm going to kill the bastard! Man! If you kill him, you're dead, too! You think your boss will sit still? There's no turning back now. Can you guarantee your safety even if you let him go? Let's use him to get your boss! What? Your boss can't do anything if we have Sang-jin. We'll help you! That's the only way you'll live! Hand Sang-jin over to us! Think of it as an opportunity, man! Shit... Hello? Are you listening? In-gu? Help! Help me! You bastard... Help me! Please don't kill me In-gu. Think of my brother. Don't kill me, man. My brother was good to you. He said you're like a brother to him. He said he wished that you were his brother over me. I didn't mean to do it to you man. Please, don't kill me! - You bastard. - In-gu! Please! Don't kill me! Get up you bastard. Get up. - In-gu. - Get in there. Where's the gang? All scattered out. Call 'em all in, now! Hyun-su... I can't do it to my boss... In-gu? Don't worry boss. I have Sang-jin safe. I knew it. I'm sorry. It's my fault that things went out of hand. Boss, I really want out now. Will you help me, sir? Okay, I will. Let's meet. I'll go with you, sir. No, I'm going alone. They're all here, sir. Let's go! Stop right there! Pull over, now! Stop the car, now! This is Dong-gok dong crossroads. Please send the ambulance. The traffic accident happened. They're gonna die soon... Here, here! Sang-jin! Sang-jin! Come on man! Sang-jin! Get up, man! Sang-jin! You bastard! Get up! Sang-jin! Please! No! Get up! Don't do this to me. Sang-jin! - In-gu! - Yes, boss. Are you okay? I know about Sang-jin. Forgive him. It's all over now. I turned left and there were too many cars... I had no choice but to go over to the other lane... I didn't mean it, boss. I can explain... my bumper got smashed in... There was a traffic jam and... Let me explain, boss. Please, boss... It wasn't my fault... Boss... Boss... Boss... You fuckin' bastards! You fuckin' bastards! - You piece of shit! - You piece of shit! I said I didn't kill him! Didn't you hear me? What do we do now? How will you get me out of this? What am I supposed to do now? If I let you live, will you let me go? Shit... I said I didn't kill him! The operation room Hyun-su? Hi Mi-lyung. Hi Hee-soon. Where is he? He's been in surgery for 2 hours. We'll have to wait and see. He said he was going to quit everything. He went to tell 'em that, and things got bad. Mrs. Mi-lyung Kang? Are you In-gu Kang's guardian? Yes. We have a few questions. Please come with us. It's okay hon. I'll be right back. Give me the stuff. This is your dad's stuff. Give it to your mom later. He'll be okay, don't worry. Let's go for some coffee. You didn't have to come. How's Hee-soon doing? She's fine. That's good. Take care. Smarten up when you go in this time. You'll have to wear the handcuffs from here on. Press the button first. I haven't been here in so long. Everything's changed. How are you doing in there? Don't make fun, you bastard. You try being in here at my age. You look okay. I'm doing fine. Why'd you bring her here? It's embarrassing. Hee-soon. Say something... will you? Are you okay, dad? I'm okay. They found a lot of evidence. Chief Roh had a lot of illegal guns. Sang-jin will be cleared as an accident and your boss as self-defense. Things must be hard with me in here. Of course it is... Stay healthy and come out soon. I told Min-chul to finish the term and come home. I don't know if that's good for him, though. I'll stay with you and help. Your men don't listen, man. It's not easy. So, I'm trying to settle things under your name. Your 20 years in the field helped a lot, man. Can you... Find a spot for me on your side? Why did Hyun-su give us a lot of money? I borrowed it.
