Mom? I am here. Mom. You forgot that. How could I forget this. Are you sure this is the right thing? It feels like it'd be better if we thought about it. Yeah, I do. We don't have any other option, Clara. We are going to be fine. Okay. If I get off early I can pick you up. Oh, it really don't matter, I will take a bus. I will be off early, I got a couple of things to do for Jenny's party. Don't worry. Have a good day. You too, Mom. How you doing? I don't know. How we're paying for all of this? We put up the house. I knew it. It's because of you I am still alive. We decided it together. What did you all decide together? To live on the street... for 18 years. Your mother and I have been paying on that house... just to fuck it all up. Next year I will be a licensed electrician. So, no more illegal odd jobs. Going to be fine. I never wanted to be a burden. Don't say that, Dad. I am leaving, babe. So you got what you have been waiting for? Yeah, I got it. Would it be right? That's not your concern. You can go to hell. That's exactly where I am going. But if I make it back, I going to make so much money, you going to love me again. Your brother would feel better if family members visited more often. A year is a long time for someone in his condition. I am the only family Ronald has. I try to get down here as often as I can. Overall, his condition is still borderline, Mr. Hodges. To skip his medications even for a day could be serious. Yes, ma'am. Sign here and here, and Ronald is released. Your brother is here, came to get you. You have to go. They take care of you in there? Yeah. Good. It's a new car? Yeah, do you like it? Yeah. Let's go. When I turned five years old, I got a little kitten. And it was so cute that I took them to bed with me every night. I want a little lamb, and I will take it to bed with me every night too. People don't keep sheep inside, silly. I will. Didn't you hear? We don't keep sheep inside and we don't take them to bed with us. My little lamb has to be all white with black ears. Why black ears? That way I won't get them mixed up with the other sheep. I will be able to recognize him. Very clever. Thanks, Mom. What is going on, man? Kico Tevero... Hey, wait a minute. What the hell you doing, goddamn it. What the fuck you doing? Goddamn it. Let me the fuck out of here. Oh, shit. Goddamn. Get me the fuck out of here. A lot of people would want that. I am sorry. Thank you. That was his job, I mean there's nothing I can do for you. Maybe in a few days. Hi. Can I get you anything? Coffee maybe... I am good. No. No, babe. So what's this job about, man? Dope? No. Nothing like that. You need somebody taking care of? No. I am just asking for a good word. What you want to go in my place? Listen, I am broke. I am on the street. Hey, I haven't forgotten what you did for me when I was away. If this thing works out. I will set you up. I promise. How long exactly will it take? One day. Jesus. You make all that cash in one day? If I make it. But you made it the last time, right? That was last time. As long as my luck doesn't run out, you can count on me. Hey. Vincent, do you still live at 135, Kissam Avenue, Talbot Ohio? Yeah. You have a phone number I can reach you at if I have any further questions? Sure. 216-555-0145. Okay Vincent, I think that about does it. Thank you. Can you recall anything else he could have told you about this affair? No. I already told you. He never spoke about it. Even when he was high? No. Did anyone else come into the house, aside from the paramedics and the police? There was an electrician. He was the one that called 911. Thank you, Mrs. Harrison. Thank you. Thank you. You sleep okay? Yeah. I feel much better now. Did you take your medication? No. Look here... you know the doctor says that you're not supposed to skip a dose. Fuck her. I feel much better without it anyway. Tails 40 fucking times, you know, our luck's fucked. I know, we're going to make it. Don't pay attention to that shit. You will be going for job and nothing else. What do you think? You're very handsome. They're going to love you. Unshackle his legs. Hey mister, you in charge here, you are going to tell me what the hell's going on. How do you feel? How do I feel? Hey man. I have been in this goddamn box for two and a half days, man. Tell me what's going on. What do you all want from me? Give him shower. Change your clothes, something fresh. Where you all taking me, man? Fuck you. What about his stuff? What're you talking about? Give it to him. Fuck you, guys. Hello, Mr. Harrison? Yeah. Tomorrow at noon, go to the post next door to Grand Central. Hang on. 200 West 39 Street. Okay. With the key that you found with the cellphone, you will open box 2-5-3. Inside you will find another train ticket, more instructions. Your ticket will be to Macomb, but you will get off one stop before Macomb. One stop before. Is that clear? Yeah. Ticket, please. He's getting off at Macomb. What time do we arrive? Train gets in at 3:10. Can I help you guys with anything else? No, thank you. Can I get a bottle of water and a ham sandwich? You Flink? Yeah, get in. Thanks. I want to go here. You know it? Yeah. Is it far? No, it's right around the corner. That will be $17.70. Keep the change. Wow, thank you. Give me your phone. Get in the car. Which number is it? 13. Come on. Stand in the middle of the carpet. Take your clothes off. Faster. Take off the rest. Get dressed. You didn't find it strange dropping off somebody in the middle of nowhere? When the guy is paying me. He's the customer. So, he can get out wherever he wants. You didn't see anything else unusual? No. I just left him there and I left. Follow me. Have a seat. Who's that? I can explain. I know... Shut up. Go get Jack. You're probably wondering... what I am doing here. Quiet. Mr. Gomer. Is this young man who's playing tonight? Yes, that's him. Very courageous. Two million. Put 700 thousand, on number six. What's going on? Who's he? What do you mean? He's the guy I picked up at the intersection. He's not who I was expecting. Well, he had the number. Harrison is dead. What are you talking about? He OD'd. And who the fuck are you? I am an electrician. I was working at his house. Give me your ID. Did he tell you about this? No, I overheard him talking. I knew he was waiting for a letter and it could be a lot of money. So I took it and followed the instructions. Do you know what this is about? No. No, I have no idea. Follow me. Do you think the cops send him? Maybe we should, get out now. If we leave and the cops show up... then the others will think we ratted. We would be dead men. Where you going? I should go and talk to them. Excuse me, gentlemen. If it's a problem... maybe... then I think I should leave. I will leave. It's too late. What if I don't want to be here? You have to play now. 600 thousand, on number 13. Good luck. Attention. The first round is about to begin. Go fuck your mother. What's he saying? Cocksucker go fuck your mother. Attention. You got to listen to him. I am asking the guards to please distribute the bullets. One bullet to each player. Hans, we are born only once and we die only once. You must be philosophical. You are the descended of the great Schopenhauer. I am asking all gamblers to please step back. Please, gentlemen back up. Back up. Thank you, gentlemen. Please boss. Have a seat. Players.

Shoot. Two. Everyone, out of the ring. Are you done with your little drama. Fuck you. This is the last time you're trying the bullshit, you get it? Hey, how much money they're paying you to watch my ass? What the fuck is it to you. I will give you 50 times more what they're giving you. You let me get my ass out of here.

You know what you can do with two million? You get all the high class pussy, all the fancy cars, all the bubbly shit you can drink, brother.

My man's out, I want to bet on yours. Sure. I take 50 points of the top, just for this round. Okay. Want some morphine? No. They all do it... I said, no. Hey, you lost your player, didn't you?

I think I can do you one better. 60-40, 60 for you, 40 for me. You have to bet at least 400 thousand. Player number six, he has the most experience. You know who I am talking about. I know your player. Made your offer, I just made mine. 60-40 it is. Place your bets, gentlemen. Alright, on your feet now. Move it, let's go. Now. I said, move it. Let's go.

Doctor, to the ring. He can not continue. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Is this a fucking game or a slaughterhouse? My player didn't die in the game. He is still alive. What the hell is that. You know the rules Mr. Taylor. Hans. Hans. When you start something, you must stay with it until the end. Nobody forced you to do this. You are two for two. You are great. You are great. How much I win for the first two rounds? 2.9 million. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. You need to pick your number. What you got? I will be standing behind Player 13. I want to bet the 2.9 plus an addition of 1.2. If you make it to the end, you will make a lot of money. What the fuck do you care? Just making conversation. Three million. Okay, three million. I will give you three million dollars. Okay, that will change your life forever. Where you planning on getting all this money? Listen. Me and a couple of my boys, we hit this armored car in Mexico. My two partners they got blown away. I got away for about a day and a half. I had enough time where I got rid of the truck and I hid the money. If you got that kind of money, how is it they let you out of the prison? You should have been a gold mine for them. Shit man... They beat my ass in that jail, but I didn't talk, okay? I didn't say a goddamn word. Listen, if I would have said something, they would have smoked my ass, and taking the money. I got the money. I got a lot of fucking money. Finish the game and you will leave peacefully. In your case there's no way you escape. They will blow both our brains out, before we got in to front door. You have a better chance to survive in the ring. Please, give me something to write with it. I want my money. Don't worry about the money. What's important, to see you go all the way. It's pretty fucked up? We two are brothers. I hate that fucking number. Bang. Calm down. Just let it go. Calm down a little bit. Forget about it. Shot two already. He shoots three, you get a bonus. That would be wonderful. How much do I have? 1.1 million. Listen, man... I got all the details... of where I buried all the money, there's a map here. Listen to me, man. I got a son. He's doing some time. He got another... I don't know 18 months to go, so... If anything happens to me, and I don't make it out of here... I want you to take this note out of my pocket, go get that money, and I want you to split with him. We got a deal? Okay, you got it. Thirteen. Number six. Number three. Eleven. Eleven.

For the third round, I will ask the guards to distribute... three bullets to each player. Three bullets. Sir, please. Can I please have a chair for my player? He's not feeling too well.

It doesn't matter. We can drop you off to the nearest train station if, you like. Yeah, I will get my things, I meet you downstairs. Would you like a drink? No, thank you. Where you going? I am going with him. Why don't you go to the room, get our coats. I couldn't find him. Get in the car. Sir, your total is going to be 38. Thank you. Hi. Hi, Officer Stellar.

Blue jacket, seated. Excuse me, sir, come with us please. You want him uncuffed? Uncuff him. Leave us alone. Thank you. Where did you hide the money? I don't know what you're talking about? Sit down. I said, sit down. You're not under arrest, Vincent. And you won't be as long as you tell me everything that went on out there. I never met them. Don't bullshit me. I am telling the truth. Why did they pick you up at the intersection, if they're looking for Harrison. The driver didn't know Harrison. When he pulled up, I flashed him the signal. A signal? A piece of cardboard with a number. Where did he drop you? Somewhere in the forest. What happened? When I got there, there were 2 other guys waiting in another car. When they saw me, I knew I was screwed. I told them Harrison was dead, and I was willing to take his place. But they didn't go for it. Either they didn't believe me or whatever. But they didn't want me to be there. I saw one of the men had a gun. When he reached for it, I reacted. I ran and I just kept running. Did they chase you? They chased me, they shot at me. But I just kept running. I ran so hard that I lost the heels of my shoes. If you saw them again, would you be able to identify them? Of course. Could you take me to that place in the forest? I was in a panic. I have been running for hours. It was dark. How the fuck do you expect me to remember where I was? But if we took you to that intersection, you'd get your bearings, right? The driver blindfolded me. You're lying. I am telling the truth. Put your boots back on. Can I go now? Twenty two dollars please. Hello? Mom? Vince. How's dad? How is everything? Everything is the same. He was wondering about you. Where are you? I am still in Chicago. How much longer? Not long, I will be home soon. What, what happened? Everything go okay? Listen mom, I send some money in the mail. Certified mail. Money? A lot of money. If you are not home, have Clara wait for it, okay. What do you mean money? From where? I will explain everything later. Just make sure somebody is home. You're scaring me, Vincent. Are you in trouble? No, everything's fine. Just make sure somebody is home tomorrow, okay. Vincent, please tell me what's going on. I love you. Eighteen twenty-five. How much for the lamb? It's not for sale. I will give you 100 bucks. For the lamb? Yeah. It's snowing. Yeah. Going far? I am going home. Where? Ohio.
