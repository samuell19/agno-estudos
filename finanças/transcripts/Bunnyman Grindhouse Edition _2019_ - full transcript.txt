(ominous music) - [Narrator] A life fades. A vision dims. All that remains are my memories. I remember a time of chaos, ruined dreams, a wasted life. But most of all, I remember the man we call Bunnyman. To understand who he was, you have to go back to another time. A time of anger and vengeance. (gentle music) A child, unloved, unwanted. A man born of fire and hate, left for dead. A humanity gone now or swept away for reasons long forgotten. His creators touched off a blaze that engulfed them all. Even with weapons, they were nothing. They built a house of straw in the middle of a firestorm. In the years that would follow, Michael would lay waste to everything he touched. He would exist in a no man's land. He became a wandering nomad, in search for peace that he will never find. There are those who chose to hunt him. And there are those who he hunted. And there are those who would die by his hand. Wherever he roamed, death would follow. But nothing could stem the avalanche. They created a killing machine and no one was safe. A whirlwind of death, a firestorm of fear. Michael's hate began to feed on their hate. Violence beget violence. In the roar of a fire, he lost everything. He became a shell of a man. A hollowed out, desolate man. A man haunted by the demons of his past. A man who wandered out into the wasteland. And in this maelstrom of decay, in this blighted place, is where he learned to live again. (ominous music) (upbeat music) - [Jenn] Please, don't. Please, no. Help us. Somebody help. Please help. Help! Please, help! - Ah, come on! (ominous music) - [Rachel] John, just go around him. - [John] I'll try. He's all over the place. (truck hooting) (dramatic music) (truck hooting) You have to be fucking kidding me! - He's picking up speed! (dramatic music) Oh my God. - What? Look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. - [Man] They couldn't have gone very far. - Maybe I can make him hit this car. (car screeching) (car exploding) (woman screaming) Fuck! All right, we learned our lesson. - [Man] Move it. (truck hooting) - John, just pull over. Seriously John, we have to pull over now. What? - I really hope this is a good idea. - [Tiffany] Someone needs to get out and apologize. - For what? - I don't know. Clearly we pissed him off! - [John] I'll take care of this. - [Tiffany] No, you've already done plenty, but somebody does need to apologize! - [Rachel] I'll go. - What, no! - No baby I'll be fine. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. (ominous music) (truck engine revving) Excuse me! Can I talk to you for a minute? Look, I'm sorry if we pissed you off! Look, just please leave us alone. We didn't mean you any harm or disrespect. - Well, I think she pulled over to tell us that he wasn't gonna follow us. Rachel, come back over here! (truck hooting) Oh no, no, wait, wait, wait. Get back in, man. I don't think he wants you getting out of the car! - No shit, Mike, but she could be hurt! (ominous music) - Look, if I can just talk to you for a minute... - Oh my... Dude, no, no, no! - Out of the car, man! - I know that, Mike, but she could be hurt! - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine! - We're getting out of here. - No, man. You can't try and outrun him. He'll just knock us off the road! - No shit, Mike! What do you suggest? - I don't know. I mean, we can try and out wait him! - Any other suggestions? - [Mike] I say we make a run for it and meet up on the other side of the clearing. - No. I say we play it safe. If we walk in this heat, we'll just get dehydrated. How much water do we have? - We don't have any water! - All right. So we'll wait it out. (somber music) (ominous music) - [Rachel] John! (truck hooting) (ominous music) (dramatic music) - [Girl] No, please. (ominous music) - Please, don't. Please, no. Help! Help us. Somebody help. Please, help! Help! Please, no. (somber music) - What are we gonna do? - I don't know. I don't know. - Fuck. (solemn gongs) (loud banging) - What the hell! - Motherfucker. (truck engine revving) (car sputtering) - [John] Oh, fuck! - Where's Jack? - Huh? Rachel? What is it? - Jack? Jack? - [John] Rachel! - Rachel. - Jack went to fix the car and he was under the car and then we got hit by the car. Jack was under the car when we got hit! - Jack. (ominous music) ♪ I say, did you want to go on ♪ (Rachel heaving) - Jack. Jack. Jack. Jack. (gentle music) ♪ We know something isn't right ♪ ♪ Our friend is dead underneath the car ♪ ♪ There ain't no help to find ♪ ♪ This shit's really gettin' old ♪ ♪ That girl ain't stop bitchin' for hours ♪ ♪ Momma's gonna cry ♪ ♪ Dad's gonna beat my ass till next week ♪ ♪ Then I'm gonna cry ♪ ♪ Why did our friend have to go ♪ ♪ Jack, I miss you so ♪ ♪ The best brother I ever had ♪ ♪ And now you're gone, gone, gone ♪ ♪ Only the Lord ♪ ♪ Can save us now ♪ ♪ Only the Lord ♪ ♪ Only the Lord ♪ - I say we follow these crosses, head up this path. - Why? - Because there's bound to be people or... Obviously someone's been here, Mike! - Come on, dude. It looks like this shit's been here for ages. - Okay, Mike. What do you wanna do? You wanna keep walking along the highway? - No, I don't know, all right? I just don't wanna keep walking. - I don't care anymore. - Well, what's with all the upside-down crosses? Mike, what do they mean? - [Mike] You don't wanna know, okay? Believe me. - Give me a minute. - You okay? - Yeah, I just need to catch my breath. - [John] Sure? - Yeah. (dramatic music) John? They're everywhere! - That's okay. I'm sure there's an explanation, okay? - No, no, John. We need to go back. - Sh! Listen to me. I'm sure there's an explanation. Try not to think about it, okay? Go on. (somber music) - [Rachel] Wow! The nature around here sure is remarkable. In fact, I think that species of animal is instinct. - [John] That's right, Rachel. What a great observation. In fact, that's a California grizzly bear, the one extinct in 1922. Look over to your right. Look at the random indigenous people of the Oroonoko tribe of South America. Good thing they don't see us and they're doing their own thing. We should continue on our travels. (birds cawing) (gentle chiming music) - [Rachel] Oh look, we've been walking for so long, we walked back in time. - [John] Yes, that's right, Rachel. That's a very astute observation. We must have walked into a wormhole, and gone back in time to New York city circa 1970. - Where did they go? They disappeared into that portal over there. Let's follow them. - Okay. - [Rachel] Ah, I see. I understand, John. Yes, a wormhole. That makes so much sense. Good thing we're so far away, you can't see us as we are blending in with the crowd. - [John] Yes, Rachel. You are exactly right. But we should walk back through the wormhole to our present time to continue our epic journey. (birds cawing) - [Woman] I hope it happened to them. To have no feeling for my children. - [Man] It could've been worse. At least they let us take some clothing. They didn't have to. (birds chirping) - How you doing? Hi, how you doing? We got a little lost, and our car broke down. We were wondering if we could use your phone. Do you have a phone we could use? Sir? - I don't know if you know this, but there's... Well, I mean it looks like... There's bags of bones down the way a little. - So? - Well, it's not exactly the proper burial procedure. - Well, you know whose bones they are? - No. - Then don't worry about it. - Look, do you have a phone we can use here? Do you have a phone that we can use? - Depends on how you ask. And who asks. - Okay, do you have a phone that we can use, please? Dude, look, our friend was killed, okay? There's a killer out there and he's after us. - Kids. Always so dramatic about the smallest of things. - Look, man. Our friend is dead, okay? He was murdered, literally like 20 miles from here. We just need your help! - Well, if he's dead already, why you need the phone? I reckon you can't help him much now. - Look, can we use your phone or not? - No. - Why the fuck not? - 'Cause I said no, that's why the fuck not! - Okay, okay. Okay, we have money, - Yeah! - We can pay you. - Yeah, look. We'll pay you whatever you want! Look. - So the sweet thing talks now, does it? - Look, all right. Okay. - Dude, don't pay him. We don't need to pay him money! - All right. I've got $40, okay? $40 to make a 30-second phone call. - You lying to me, boy? - What? - You heard me, you piece of shit! There ain't nobody who can call nobody for 30 seconds! Hell, you can't even dial that fast! - Okay, then how much? Guys! - I'm not paying him any money, man. This is stupid! - Okay, guys. - [Mike] I'm not paying him any money. - [Tiffany] Shut up, Mike. - Okay. - Jesus Christ. - All right, we got... Okay, $100. Okay, $100 to make one call! - Look around, son. You see anything I could spend $100 on? Stupid little shits! - Then what do you want? - What I want, is that sweet young thing to bend over for me! Oh, I bet she's really tight! I can smell from here in this heat, if you know what I mean? - Fuck you, man! - Stop! (man laughing) - You faster than a speeding bullet, son? Oh. They be watching. So you best be leaving now. Oh, you don't think it's loaded? (gunshot blares) (laughing) Hey, you come back when that fine young ass needs a man with experience! - Mike. - Fuck you, asshole! - I got something for you right now! Whoo, come on baby! (laughing) (film reel whirring) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Refresh yourself, it's intermission time. The concession stand is open and ready to serve you. Hot and cold beverages and other delicious snacks. So and you're a fan of watching... During our 10-minute intermission. Glad to have you with us tonight. We hope you'll come to see us often.

If you like hot dogs, you'll love corn dogs. Everybody does. Corn dogs. Hot dog. - [Narrator] Today, we're interviewing a stomach. - Hello, there. - [Narrator] What is life like as a stomach? - Oh boy, it was humdrum. I mean, until what's his name discovered Tony's Pizza. - [Narrator] Tony's Pizza? - Yeah, I was suffering from the pizza cravings until Tony's came along. Crispy crust and zesty sauces. (laughs) wow! - [Narrator] And so now- (wacky electronic music) What's that? - Another pizza craving. Just thinking about Tony's sets it off. - [Narrator] Where are you going? - He's going to get a Tony's pizza, and I follow him anywhere. - [Narrator] Does your stomach send you pizza craving signals? (electronic music) Oh wow. Tony's, the pizza cravers pizza. Available at the concession stand. Yum, yum. It's a meal in itself. - [Narrator] And now, on with the show. - What are we gonna tell Jack's parents? We need to tell 'em something, you know. Ignoring me isn't gonna shut me up! Maybe this is all our faults for getting ourselves into this situation. Maybe it's karma, I don't really know. But I knew that we should have never left the car in the first place, and now Jack is just sitting there rotting! What the hell are we doing? We have no fucking idea where we are. There's no roads anywhere and nobody can agree on one direction to go! And we're all gonna just end up like Jack! - All right, shut the fuck up! Okay, seriously. What, you think any of us are happy that we're stuck out here in the ass end of nowhere, butt-fucking Egypt? Look, we're all starving, we're all tired! I mean seriously, you just gotta pull your shit together, 'cause you're starting to fucking lose it! And this whole blame game, it's really not doing anything! - What are you trying to say, Mike? - That none of us are happy that Jack's dead! Okay, and now is not the time to talk about it. I mean, it's just making shit worse! - You know what, Mike? If this is the way that you show compassion in a relationship, then fuck you! I don't need this! - What? You're just gonna walk off? Seriously, what are you doing? What the hell are you doing, Tiffany? Tiffany, where the hell do you think you're going? Look, you're not seriously pulling this shit! What are you doing? Don't throw that. You better not fucking... What the hell's wrong with you? Real mature, Tiff! (ominous music) (crickets chirping) - Okay I got the body. Jacob! Jacob, let's go! Who the fuck are they? They're gonna want a ride. Gimme your arm! - Why? - Just give it to me! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? But pop said no more playing with the bodies! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know what he said, and I also know you were feeling those girls up! All right, so now listen to me! I know pops did you wrong and I know his beatings made you a little slow, but so help me, you fuck this up and I will beat you into next week, you got that? - Yes ma'am. - Are you getting this? - Yeah. - Now, just let me do all the talking, all right? And just play along. Everything's gonna be all right. I love you, you know that? So just wave when I point to you, okay? - Hi! - Hey, how's it going? - We had some car trouble down the way a little bit and we were wondering, maybe you can help us- - It looks like you're having a bit of car trouble. - Yeah well, damn thing overheats and all you know. - Well, no, I'm pretty good with cars. I mean, maybe I could help you out? - Yeah. You know what? Don't worry about it. It's cooled down, we'll be okay. Looks like you guys had a little bit of trouble. - Yeah, that's one way to put it. - Well, since your car is working, I was wondering, maybe you could give us a ride to the nearest gas station? - Yeah, you know I would but we don't really have any room in the car right now. I guess- - Are you serious? Lady, do you have any idea how long we've been walking on these roads? I don't know the last time we had any food or water. We've been out here for hours! - All right, look. Look, maybe you could just give one of us a ride? Just to the nearest town? - Okay, like I was trying to tell you, I would but we had a little more car trouble. We also had a flat tire and my friend, hurt his hand so I gotta get him over to the emergency room. What I can do is come back for you guys maybe in like 20 minutes, okay? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Look. My girlfriend's a pre-med, okay? So maybe she could help out your friend, and you could help us out? What? - What is your fucking problem, huh? - What? I'm just trying to help! - No, you know what, I don't even know what you're trying to do. I'm trying to help you out here but you just keep pushing me! - Lady, I'm trying to make the best of the situation. - No, you know what? I am this close to leaving your asses and your shitty attitudes out here in the middle of the fucking forest. How would you like that, huh? But I'm gonna be the better person here, and forget we even talked about this. So like I said, I can come back for you in 20 minutes. Take it or leave it! - Productive chat there, buddy. - Dude, shut up. - They buy it? You fool 'em? - I don't know. Fuck. I should just run the little shits over right now! - Yeah. - Shit, I can't. The little fuckers'll splatter all over the road and I don't wanna be stuck cleaning 'em up all night. We'll come back. - What if somebody else comes by and picks 'em up? - Fuck! - I didn't mean to upset you. - You know, just shut up for a minute! (car engine revving) Hey. Hey listen, I'm sorry about back there. I don't know what happened to me. I'm just worried about my friend. I gotta get him to the hospital but, you know, it's not really safe for you guys out here. There's no lights, and there's a lot of drunk drivers in this neighborhood. So, if you guys go down the road a ways, there's a path. Take it, it'll go to this old cabin. It's abandoned. It's not much but it'll be safe and warm and I'll come pick you guys up there. - Okay. - All right? - Thanks, I appreciate it. - You guys hungry? - [Rachel] Yeah, we haven't eaten in God knows how long. - Gimme that. - It's mine! - I'll get you another one! Here. - Thanks. Please hurry. - Okay. - Thanks. (gentle music) (ominous music) (girl screaming) (dramatic music) (gentle music) - [John] Okay, Mike, what do you wanna do? You wanna keep walking along the highway? - [Tiffany] What the hell are we doing? We have no fucking idea where we are. There's no roads anywhere and nobody can agree on one direction to go. - [Melissa] Go down the roadways, there's a path. Take it, it'll go to this old cabin. It's abandoned. It's not much but it'll be safe and warm and I'll come pick you guys up there. - [John] We got a little lost and our car broke down. Do you have a phone we could use? - [Man] No. (laughs) - [Melissa] What is your fucking problem, huh? - [John] What, I'm just trying to help. - [Melissa] No, you know what? I don't even know what you're trying to do. I'm trying to help you out here but you just keep pushing me. - [John] I'm trying to make the best of the situation. - [Melissa] No, you know what? I am this close to leaving your asses and your shitty attitudes out here in the middle of the fucking forest. How would you like that, huh? So, like I said, I can come back for you in 20 minutes. Take it or leave it. - [Man] Oh, they be watching. So you best be leaving now. (laughing) - [Man] I feel like someone's watching us. - [Woman] What are you talking about? - [Man] I don't know. Oh yeah, we're American kids, from America. Lossens a beautiful American root. - [Man] Yeah, America is great. - [Man] It is too bad. It is unfortunate it is some time in the 1917, and we do not have cellphones yet. What can we do now? We must continue on our travel to find help. It is agreed. We go now. - Jenn, what are you doing? Let's go! - I think I hear something. No I'm serious. I think I heard something. - I'm not gonna run around the woods because Jenn's hearing things again. - Fuck you, bitch. - We'll wait here.

There's something back there! - What about Jenn? I mean, she's still alive? - No. - Okay, okay. We need to block all the doors and block the windows. Rachel, come here! (ominous music) Help me block these windows. - You okay? - No, Mike, I'm so fucking far from okay right now. - All right, all right, all right, all right. Calm down, calm down! Look, it's gonna be all right, okay? Come here. You'll be okay, all right? Let's just get the windows right now. We're gonna get out of here, okay? Go help out! - Mike, Mike! - Fuck! What?

Which means you slept with a lot of 'em. You can tell me, I don't mind. You know what darling? You really got to relax! All going to be okay. You better learn to relax. You're starting to put me a little bit on edge! 'Cause I don't want you working on the first out of deck. (chainsaw buzzing) (Rachel laughing) - Rachel, Rachel! Rachel! Rachel, Rachel!

If we head down the road he's just gonna run us off again! We might not be so lucky this time. Sh, it's okay, it's okay! I have a plan. Okay? Do you trust me? Okay? You trust me? Huh? Here. She's yours, huh? She's dead too! Are you happy? Huh? Are you fucking happy? You took everyone. You took everything away from me! (dramatic music) Come on. I have nothing to fight you with.
