[wind whistling] [pigeon fluttering] [calm music] [upbeat music] [Jonas] Sure we're good to, uh, walk through here? [Elliot] Yeah, man, I do it all the time. You got your mask? [Jonas] What do you call this, Mr. Camp Counselor? [Elliot] Uh, I don't know what you call it in LA. But where I'm from, that's not a mask. [Jonas] We're from the same... [scoffs] Low-key, is it, uh, White Claw o'clock already, or? [Elliot] I mean, did you pack any beers or did you just pack your beloved seltzers? [Jonas] I packed your, uh, old man beer, whatever it is. -Lagunitas. -[Elliot] Yeah. You know they're local, right? [Jonas, mocking] Uh, you know they're local, right? [Elliot] Well, when we send off Mom, I thought it'd be a good idea to do a little cheers, you know? [Jonas] Bet. Bet. That'd be pretty lit, honestly. [Elliot sighs] I'mma take a piss real quick. You cool? Be right back. [Jonas] Do your thing. Perfect timing. Let's see. Let's see. The lighting is, uh... not ideal. Nobody cares about the quality anyway. They just want to see the hair. It looks bright and tight. We doin' it, we doin' it, Jonas. Let's go. Hey, guys, it's your boy, Jonas. Jonas with the Mostest coming at you from my old hometown of Sonoma, California, or as I like to call it, Slownoma. You know, we out here, it's twenty-twenty... one. We out here doing new things, but also doing old things. Coming back to hometowns, vintage visits. We doing it right, and we doing it tight. You know how it works. But sadly... I'm here on some not so great news. You see, my mother... [sighs] ...my mother has passed on. But luckily, because of DTF Eyewear, I got these new shades to hide the tears. But this is a very tender moment for me, for my family. So we're gonna go up to a lake and we're gonna spread her ashes. Spread her ashes. Spread-- spread her ashes. Is it spread or scatter? Spread-- spread her ash-- Scatter her ashes. -We're gonna scatter her ashes. -[Elliot] Yo. Hey. [Jonas] That's what we're gonna do. We're gonna spread her ashes and you're gonna bring the drama, Jonas. You're gonna bring it this time, because you need to melt hearts. You need to make tears fall. You're gonna do this right, and you're gonna do this tight, because you're Jonas. You are Jonas with the Mostest. You got this. Okay, let's do this. [Jonas clears throat] Hey, guys, it's your boy, Jonas. Jonas with the Mostest out here. [Elliot] I got to say, man, if you're gonna keep doing these, like, Instagram videos and TikTak-- -[Jonas] TikTok. -[Elliot] videos-- What? -[Jonas] It's TikTok. -[Elliot] Yeah, whatever. I'm just saying, man, like, maybe you should add some production value to it, you know? Like, flip the camera horizontal instead of vertical. Or you ever seen the beginning of Double Indemnity when he confesses at the-- at the very top? Like, if you did something like that, I'd watch that for sure. [Jonas] El, you're gonna have to help me out a little bit. -[Elliot] Hmm. -What's Double indemnity? Is it like a web series, game show? Like, Double Jeopardy or something? You've never seen Double Indemnity? Mr. Hollywood's never seen Double Indemnity? -Who's in it? -Oh, man. Fred McMurray, Barbara Stanwick. Oh, man, but Edward G. Robinson, he steals the show, I'm serious. Ellie, I think you're making up all of those names. -[Elliot sighs] -[Jonas] Is it old? [Elliot] No, man, it's a classic. Well, yeah, it's old, but I even have the criterion, it's remastered. Cool, cool, cool, but, like, you didn't really answer my question. Like, how old are we talking? Like '80s old? Is that what you think old is? The '80s? [Jonas sighs] Ellie, when was it made? I don't know. Well, 1942, actually. Wait. No, 1944, that's it. Do you ever watch anything that's not made before Mom and Dad were born? I mean, right now I'm on a strict regimen of black and white movies. You know, like, pre-Second World War. Cringe. We're gonna, you know, cut to the right. -Yeah. -[Elliot] Huh? [Jonas] Like, not-- we're gonna go this way. [Elliot] This way? [Jonas] Ellie, I don't know if I can do it. -[Elliot] It's faster this way. -[Jonas] No, I know, but-- [Elliot] If you-- if you go slow, it's harder. -[Jonas pants] Okay. -[Elliot] You used to be able-- [Jonas] I know, I'm behind you. -[keyboard clicking] -[cellphone chimes] [Jonas sighs] Jeez. [Elliot] Uh-oh, I heard a sigh and a cell phone. -[Jonas] It was me. -He's on the phone. -[Jonas] Yep. -What is it, Stacey? No, it's not her. What, is she mad 'cause all the reality show girls want a little piece of Jonas with the Mostest? [Jonas chuckles] No, you know, she's part of the game, too, so she gets it. It's not-- it's not anything like that. [Elliot] Wait. She's-- she's an influencer, too? [Jonas chuckles] No, she's a makeup artist. [Elliot] Oh, okay, so there's hope for her. [Jonas laughs mockingly] Where's your queen, huh? [Elliot] You know me, man, I'm busy, uh, holding down the fort. -[Jonas] Oh, the fort. Mm. -[Elliot laughs] You know, you should get a vacation from this fort. No, really. You should go down to, like, Rosa or the Bay or something. I'm sure that those Oakland hipster bars or the patios are probably open. You can find-- find some girl that's just as delusional as you are. [Elliot] Okay. [Jonas] You guys can-- can, uh, get a projector and watch, uh, I don't know, 18th Century French i-- infomercials or something. Get all weird with it. [laughs] [Elliot] Yeah, well, that does sound nice. [Jonas] Yeah. [Elliot] As long as I'm not stuck on my phone all day, man, I think I'm gonna be okay. [Jonas] That's the thing, though, man, is everything in LA is through Instagram. -Like, literally everything. -[Elliot] Uh-huh. [Jonas] So, casting directors, they go, like, a-- they do a #LAModels or #SurferGuys or something, and then they-- they DM people like me to be the next big thing. Be the next big thing, you know? Yeah, people like you? Yes, LA people like me. You can give me the whole spiel of "That phone is sucking your soul out" or whatever, but-- And the more I post, the more I stack. It's that simple. And yeah, I was waiting for a call, but-- I was waiting for a call from, um, Duncan. Remember the producer I was telling you about? The-- [Elliot] Why are you talking to someone named Duncan? [Jonas] What's wrong with Duncan? [Elliot] You can't trust anybody named Duncan, Jonas. -Come on. -[Jonas] Whatever, man. He's actually a good guy. He's really important in the industry and stuff. And he's been looking at my stuff, saying I have potential and everything, trying to pass my reel along. Maybe I can be a real actor, you know? None of this... I don't know, foo-foo, teeny bopper bullshit anymore. [Elliot] I mean, do you even like what you're doing? You know, this, like, reality show, Instagram streaming stuff? -[Jonas] Yeah, I mean-- -I mean... you should take, like, an acting class or something, man. You know, like an improv class. Something that you can really hone your craft, dude-- [Jonas] They're expensive, man. And this may not be the most glamorous thing, but it-- but it pays. [Elliot] Yeah, but money doesn't buy happiness. [Jonas] Buys a fortune cookie, though. [Elliot] Yeah, but the fortune cookie's complimentary. [Jonas] Yeah, but you gotta buy the meal to get the fortune cookie. -[Elliot] No. -[Jonas] Right? [Elliot] I'm not gonna give in. [Jonas] Anyway, I'm just making my road to riches, man. On my way to happiness. Let's go. [Elliot] Jonas. [Jonas] Oh. Damn. [exhales] I forgot about this view. [chuckles] I thought-- out-- out of the corner of my eye, I thought you had, like, a flip phone or something. [laughs] You already lost, baby bro? It's Dad's compass. Mom gave it to me. She gave it to Dad a few Christmases back. You were there, though. You know, when he got lost in Yosemite. Yeah. Yeah. Can I see that? I remember thinking that if Dad could beat Half Dome like that, you know, going off to the side and sleeping-- sleeping on the fly or whatever, that... I don't know, beating cancer would be a breeze. It wasn't cancer. [scoffs] Ellie, I think I would know how our dad died. It was leukemia, Jonas. It's the same thing. Are you ser-- It's not the same thing. I mean, come on, I mean, you should remember. You were at that funeral. Ellie, I don't want to-- I don't want to do this all day, okay? There wasn't a global pandemic when Dad died. All right. -I guess that was a bit harsh. -Yeah. But I don't know, man. Food for thought. Maybe next time you're at a Zoom funeral, you don't black out your screen the whole time. Because, you know, people want to see you. Even if it is over Zoom. Zoom funeral. [laughs] Damn. That is so 2020. Goddamn 'rona. It is what it is, man. And we're here now, so, let's just... let's enjoy it. You know, being out here, you could see why Mom loved it. Trails, scenery, everything. Yeah. Let's give it to her one last time, yeah? [calm music] [birds chirping] Where's your mask? Hey, uh, let me get that for you. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. -Oh! Thank you, thank you. -There you are. Yeah, I just love the smell of lemons, you know. [sighs] You know what I mean, right? I mean, not really. Oh. Ooh. Ooh. [chuckles] You two are actually the first people I've met all day. Yeah. That's a-- that's a lemon. [Paloma] Yeah, quite right, right? -Some o' that. -So, are you two local? Uh, yeah, I mean, we're-- we're from here originally, but now I live in West Hollywood, so... Interesting. I mean, I thought Hollywood was fascinating enough without the distinct directions involved. Yeah. [Paloma] So what are your names? Uh, I'm Jonas with-- I'm Jonas. And, uh, this here is Ellie. Uh, Elliot, you can, uh-- you can call me Elliot. [chuckles] Jonas and Elliot. Such nice names. Uh, thank you. -What's your name? -Where are my manners? I'm Paloma, which means pigeon in Spanish, -so you won't forget. -[Elliot chuckles softly] Don't think we'll forget that one. Especially Ellie here. [laughs] Um. -Uh, why pigeon? -[Paloma] Uh, what do you mean? Well, like, don't, uh, pigeon and dove, like, essentially mean the same thing? [Jonas belches] [Paloma] Uh, in a way. I mean, it all depends on the connotation. They do get various press. Um, I guess I just always associated more with pigeons than doves. Um, but maybe I can reincarnate as a dove in my next lifetime for a change. Uh... Well, this has been really cool. Um, you know, I think we should be heading out-- Well, hold on. What-- what-- Uh, what brings you up here? You're just, uh, you're just picking lemons? [Paloma] Uh, it's kind of silly. I'm just wandering around. But not all those who wander are lost, right? -[Elliot chuckles] -So, what are you up to? Jut going on a hike. Actually, just spreading our Mom's ashes. -Oh, Jesus. -[Elliot] Sorry. Yeah. [Paloma] Um, my brother just passed away recently, too. Really? I'm-- I'm so sorry. [Paloma] I mean, that's actually why I'm here. You know, he went to University of Berkeley and when I was a child, we came to visit him, and he took my parents wine tasting and showed us this place. So, this trip is really for him. That's, like, a typical wine tasting. That's really sweet. Um, where's home for you? [Paloma] Um, originally, Spain. But now, when I'm not flying around, I would say Singapore is home. Singapore? -[Jonas laughs] Holy shit. -Wait, what? You-- you're fa-- you're familiar with Singapore? I lo-- I love "phuh"-- "phuh." It's pho-- pho? Hey, um, since you two are local, I do have a favor. You know, uh, I was-- I was-- I was trying to revisit some of my childhood places, um, and I lied a little back then, uh, so-- it's more like a fib, so... And now I'm a little lost. You know, it's been some time. Um, so I was wondering if you two can-- -We'll-- help you? Yeah. -Yeah. Well, I mean, I know this-- this whole area like it's my backyard. I mean, definitely, I-- I know it really well. We-- we've got some important stuff to do, though. -Yeah, but Jonas-- -It was really nice meeting-- No, no, we can help our friend. Right, Paloma? Yeah, I appreciate that. [soft bluegrass music] Yeah. [Paloma chuckles] [Paloma] So, I remember this grand tree, -all by it's lonesome. -Yeah, I know the one. It's on the other side of the vineyard. Are you sure it's the same tree? -Yeah, I'm sure. -Okay. Wait, we should all race down the vineyard. It will be so exciting. It's like Jules and Jim. -I'll be Jules. -[Elliot] Wait, wait. You, uh-- you know Truffaut? Yeah, of course. "If I'm lying, may my mother..." "...keel over at this very moment." -Shoot the piano player. -Yeah. Talking about brothers. You know, one of my favorite ones is The Soft Skin. I think it's so good. That ending when the woman comes into the restaurant and blows her husband away? -Oh, it's ruthless. -Yeah, I know. You know, uh, another one, it's kind of one of his-- Yo, yo, can we, uh, can we-- Hey! Can we, uh, move on, I guess? -Yeah, let's do it. -Okay, okay. Racers, let's get on our marks. Hey, maybe you don't have to go to those hipster bars after all, Ellie. -Okay. -No, no, no, put the bag on. -Come on. -Well-- okay. You can't win with a bag? -Okay. -All right. -Are we ready? -Yeah, let's do it. All right. Three, two-- Are you serious? -I haven't said one! -He went ahead. [Jonas laughs] ♪ I'll leave this bitter world behind ♪ ♪ Angel on my shoulder, I got the devil on my mind ♪ [Jonas spits] [Jonas] We want Jonas! We want Jonas! We want Jonas! [Elliot] You know you cheated, right? [Jonas] Yeah, I cheated. Cheated at being the best. [Jonas panting] Hoo. [Elliot] Oh, my God. [Jonas] God. [Paloma] It's funny. Not funny like "haha," but you know what people say. My brother and I, we made a pact. Remember we spit-shook on it. It was before COVID. Before times. We promised each other we would travel around the world and live life to the fullest. And to always keep each other close, even if we are far away. And it's somehow just now, a few months after he passed away, that it's settling in. My mother and father are still around, but it's not the same. No one to be spiritually defenseless with, or to share fears and secrets, or to even ask outlandish questions without fear of judgment. Just tough love and tender advice. You are a good tree. Goodbye. I just have one last spot I want to visit and I will be satisfied. [Elliot] Uh, yeah, no, no, no, of course. What? Where? [Paloma] It's like a body of water. I remember it being rather large. [Elliot] Yeah, yeah, I know what you're talking about. I mean, we're kinda heading that way. You just want to join us? -[Paloma] Oh, really? -You know, it might be... it might be that pond that's, like, right over there. I mean, it's, like, decent size 'cause you were, like, a shrimpy-ass kid at the time. That might have been-- Yeah, I-- I'm pretty sure it's Mom's lake. No, no, like, the one-- that's, like, the one that's, like, literally right over there. [Paloma] So the last time I came with my brother, we buried, like, a time capsule. And I was hoping to retrieve it today. -A time capsule? -You got to be shitting me. Like, I don't wanna be here all day, trying to suss out some buried treasure. Do you have, like, a map or something in that fanny pack, Pigeon? I remember it was off the shore of a body of water. Oh. Was there a pier, or-- or cattails? That I didn't remember, but it felt much larger than this. That's what she said. [chuckles] I'm gonna take a phone call. Duncan. It's, um, it's Jonas. Um, I know you're at those meetings probably right now. You're probably talking to people, you know, this and that and, uh, I just want to see if maybe you were able to put my name out there. Like, uh, show them my reel that I gave you. I-- I also want to make sure that link worked, um, and let them know-- let them know-- I know I have, like, a lot of reality stuff on there, but let them know I can do anything, man. I can do comedy, drama, horror. I don't know, anything. Uh, uh, I'm down for whatever. Um, yeah, I hope to hear from you soon. Hopefully after today, you're probably gonna be tired, but, like, you know, feel free to call me tomorrow, man. Do-- do whatever. Uh, uh, so this is Jonas. Jonas with the Mostest. You know, like, uh, that thing, uh... Yeah, man. Uh, let me know. Jonas out. [chuckles] [ducks quacking] Yo, you know what time it is? It's your boy, Jonas. Jonas with the Mostest. Here coming at you from Sonoma, California, with my DTF shades. Ah! Again? I mean, it's just... [Jonas] Coming at you with the "Hey, guys!" What? Uh, nothing, you just... you gotta let him do his thing and let it get him-- let it-- let him just get it out of his system, and then-- you know what? I'm here to help you, so let's just look. [laughs] Actually, I'm not sensing any mystical energy that a young Paloma would bury her time capsule here. I think we ought to take a look at your mother's site. Yeah, no, that's-- that sounds great. Yeah, once he's done doing that, then we'll get started. Here. [grunts] What's that? Oh, this is just an old-- kind of an old-- -No, that. -[Elliot] Oh, this? You're looking at this. This is, uh, my dad's compass. That's quite heavy for a compass. I thought they were usually lighter. Yeah, well, I think my mom wanted to get my dad something that was kind of bulky and big so he wouldn't lose it so easily. You know, he used to get-- he used to get lost sometimes. That's smart. Me, I have a horrible sense of direction. Oh, that's all right. I mean, I know where my mom's lake is, and it's-- it's definitely no Mediterranean, but it's a pretty good lake. Mediterranean. I wish I can take a dip in that glorious sea again. Good thing I didn't bury it there. We'd never have found it. Well, we're gonna find it, and if not today, then we can look tomorrow or the next day. I'm free the next couple of days, so it really doesn't matter. -We can-- -I can't. I fly home tonight. You-- you-- you fly home tonight? [Paloma] Yeah. Oh. [Paloma] It's not like that. It's for work. Oh. For work. Okay, that makes sense. Uh, what do you do for work? Oh, you can take a guess. You want me to-- you want me to guess? -[Paloma] Mm-hmm. -[Elliot] Oh, okay, um... Well, you say you're a pigeon, and you also say you fly around a lot, so... -I'm gonna say pilot. -[Paloma laughs] Close, but I don't have that much control. Okay, control. Um, flight attendant? Singaporean Air. That's cool. Yeah, I just hand out the free crackers. I never travel with the same crew, so no sense of companionship. Not like what you and your brother have. [Jonas speaking in distance] Yeah, well, you don't really know us that well, Paloma. But still, I wish-- I wish you could at least hang out a little bit more before your flight, you know. I mean, you could come back and hang out at our place for a little bit, or-- or I mean, my place. It-- it used to be our place, but it's my place now. Some confusion over whose place it is? No, no, I-- there's no confusion. It's just that-- it's Jonas and I's childhood home, you know, it was my mom and dad's, and Jonas and I were raised there our whole lives, through and through, straight up and down. But... you know, just don't say anything to Jonas about me saying that it was my house and not his, 'cause, you know, it's a little complicated. Okay. So you've never moved, huh? Your only home? No. Oh, wow. Can't tell you how many times I've moved in my day. Yeah. But I guess it's not a bad place to grow up or settle down. At least I know somebody who lives here now. [Elliot chuckles] Yeah, you got me there for sure. [Jonas] ...down there, but, you know, we out here, we doing the thing. Anyway, just want to say that I'm so stoked to get back on set, thanks to DTF Eyewear. Stay tuned and stay gorgeous. [sighs] [whispers] Stupid. [cellphone ringing] Hey, hey, hey, Dun-- Hey, babe. Look, I was-- [scoffs] I was dead ass texting you as you called. You interrupted, so... Stacey. Babe, it-- it's not that simple, okay? These-- these things-- you know, these things take time. You got to finesse the situation. I'm doing everything right. Uh, you know, I-- I gotta go do the ashes and shit, and then after that-- Babe, I promise, the house is gonna be on the market, and the money's gonna be in our pockets, okay? All right? So, just trust me. Okay? Okay. [sighs] [melancholic music] [Paloma] Can I see your home from here? [Elliot] Uh, not really. It's kinda on the other side of that hill right there, you know, at the end of that street. [Paloma] Uh-huh. I mean, it's pretty, at least from here. The whole town, too. Yeah, I guess it used to be a lot prettier, though. You know, our house used to have, you know, this nice little quaint street with these little, like, countryside cottages. But then all these yuppies came in and, you know, want to build big, big mansions. Hey, Jonas, you know that, uh, that pathway you used to love? You know, the one with the blackberries and the llamas? The one where we used to do our lemonade stands? Yeah, yeah, I love that path. Yeah, you loved it. But it's not here anymore. Some rich family comes in and they want to, you know, fence it off for themselves. You know, they want to fence off the creek and the hill. Everyone wants Sonoma for their own little bubble-- bubble getaway. Elliot, it's a free world, man. I mean, people should be able to get what they want, right? Like, especially if they got that cheddar, you know? I mean, you know you're talking about our neighborhood, right? I mean, that's where we grew up. It's not my neighborhood. Not anymore, anyway. Still, it's a nice time to grow up. Yeah, I mean, sure, Sonoma has its-- its perks and stuff, but I don't know, it's like a-- a lukewarm bathtub. It's nice, and you feel cozy for a little bit, but then you start to shrivel and you know you got to get out. Quite a simile, Jonas. Thank you. It's like, uh... Singapore is an island, yeah? No, it's a-- it's a peninsula. [Paloma] But if it's not an island, it might as well be. because other than school and work, there's not much to do. Except for the food, though. [laughs] I do love the food. Yeah, sounds exactly like Sonoma, except for, you know, the food. But instead of, you know, being surrounded by ocean, it's surrounded by grapes. Every-- every-- every path leads to a dead end. That's a vineyard. It's like this-- this hella claustrophobic, uh, island life, but without any of the tropical perks that you have, uh, just the cabernet. [Paloma laughs] I don't get it. How can it be an island? I mean, isn't San Francisco just right there? And-- and Oakland, Berkeley? The whole Bay area? Pigeon, pigeon. Spread your wings. Fly around. Look, there's grapes in every direction. Even-- even, uh, uh, Napa, which is, like, right there. And I don't-- I don't know why you'd want to go to Napa. They have an In-N-Out, which is dope, but it's-- it's-- it's 15 minutes away, but it feels world's apart. And they don't even let nicotine in there, but that's, like-- that's-- that's their thing. But-- okay. If Survivor had a season in Sonoma, then everybody would vote themselves off the island. They wouldn't get past the first episode. And I knew-- I knew that I didn't want to... grow old and die here a nobody. Well, I mean, what do you think about Mom and Dad? What, you think they're just nobodies, 'cause they weren't on the cover of People Magazine? No, Ellie, that's not what I'm saying. I mean, they had a family around them, man, and a community and people that cared about them until the very end. -Okay? -Cool. I know. If you want to rank their-- their level of Sonoma fame, go ahead. They were pretty cool, they had a good life, but they had excitement in the '70s and the '80s and then they settled down here. That's what I've been trying to say, is that you especially need a vacation. You need to get out of here. Get out of-- get out of the-- the grapes, man. Shit. Go to Singapore. Take a break. You think I don't-- you think I don't want to do that? You don't think I want to get out of here, man? But, you know, I've been busy, you know, taking care of our dead mom. I don't know if you remember that. I mean, if you want to come over here and trade places with me, that's-- you can totally do that. I got out of the tub. And once you get out, you can't go back in. That's it. 100%. Just, like, this entitlement, all right? I don't know where it comes from, you know? I mean, let's not forget that you're-- you're kind of just doing a reality show that's going to be on a little girl's iPad. -A dating show? -Yeah, yeah. -I mean-- -Jonas, really? Yeah, he's gonna be, like, The Bachelor or something, you know? Yeah. Like, I don't know. Tell her, Jonas. I mean, I don't even know what it is. No, I want to watch it. Where can I see it? -I'll send you-- -Oh, you want to see it? That's-- that's a great question, you know. My mom used to ask the same thing. She'd always ask, "Hey, Elliot, when's Jonas' show going to be out? Elliot, have you talked to Jonas? Did-- did Jonas text you back yet? I haven't heard from Jonas." There were audio issues. That's-- [sighs] You guys don't get it, there were... audio issues. That's-- that's the thing. They were the-- the mic wasn't working in the confessional room, so that we have to do reshoots. But it's gonna come out. I'll send you a link or something when it's out. -[Elliot] It's bullshit, man. -Don't call-- That just sounds like bullshit, man, I'm-- I'm sorry. Ellie, at least I got out. You didn't. Okay? I knew that I was meant for great things. I knew... that I... that I was gonna do something with my life. And Sonoma wasn't gonna help me give the things that I have to offer the world. I don't know, Jonas, but what makes you so sure that what you have to offer is what they want? Wow. Literally wow, Pigeon. Wow. No, no, no, you've shown your true colors now, huh? No, I'm just saying, i-- it sounds like you're blaming Sonoma for your success or lack thereof it. And it just feels like maybe in five years, you're going to sing the same sad song about Los Angeles. Careful, Jonas. -Don't hatch an egg. -I'm not. Look, I don't want to be rude, but you don't get it, okay? You don't understand this town. I'm trying to understand it, because I feel like if you can't be a big fish in a small town, ha-- it's only harder to be a big fish in a bigger town. Like, as big as the Mediterranean. Oh, you're right. You're right. You don't understand it. Neither of you understand it, okay? LA is the capital of entertainment. A place where I can actually thrive, okay? Can actually do something with their lives. Not like Sonoma, where the only thing that matters is when-- when your grapes turn into wine or whatever. I mean, you don't really know what was going on here nowadays, man. You know, like, you weren't here for the fires. And you weren't here for quarantine. I mean, I kind of think what's going on in Sonoma is kind of like what you've been missing. Weren't you the one that just a second ago was complaining about all these yuppies moving and wanting to enjoy their life, huh? -It's-- -Exactly. No. It's different, it's different because there's-- -How is that different? -No one's perfect, Jonas. There's ebbs and flows. No one's perfect. Ebbs and flows. Look, you-- all you do is defend this life. This Slownoma life. You-- but you wear it as a shield to protect yourself so that nobody can see the real you. I don't care. A lion doesn't have to tell you it's a lion. 100%. That's it. This is a comfortable life. This is the example. I can see it right now. Right there. You see that? That's Broadway. And Broadway, they named it that, because every big city has a Broadway. But it's just a farce here, because this isn't a big city. It's just pretending. But, hey, that-- that Plaza's got some attractions, right? You know, you have 4th of July, and you got, uh, uh, Ellie here, uh, his home away from home, Pizza Shack. Where he's at all day, every day. But hey, you guys got farmers markets, right? That's pretty cool. You guys can, uh, use the farmers markets, which happen once a week, to remember what day it is, because you guys are stuck in this ghost town. Or you can go to Boyes Hot Springs. [scoffs] A tourist trap. But they do have, right next to it, the best Mexican food you'll ever have. Which is not bad. I mean, I've been in LA for a long time and I-- I still haven't had a burrito that good. But everything is on this stretch of road that they-- that they had the balls to call a highway for some reason, it doesn't make any sense because it's just a road. A lot of people, you know, for fun, to get away from it all, they bring a keg up and they have a big kegger and... bring it into the mountains. And maybe-- maybe that keg will roll over on them, or they'll fall off the-- the cliff, or they'll get eaten by a mountain lion or something and they'll die. And then they'll end up in Sonoma Cemetery and be here eternally. Stuck. Which is no different than anybody else here. And Pigeon, if you are looking so hard for a time capsule, you don't have to look any further because that's it. [Paloma] He left home when he was a child. Early on, he grew tired outside. And his parents talked and talked. He just left like a dark goodbye. He became a wanderer and his plan was this. To leave the solitude that pampered him and to join those whose days are drowned in sound. To approach someone, one us with the sea.

How could you forget this? -I don't know. -It's like a platform. That's kind of like a stage, right? Yeah. -Yeah. -[both laughing] -There you go. -Yeah. [both laughing] Hey, wait, remember when Mom, uh, took us to a Springsteen concert when we were younger? Oh, yeah, are you kidding me? That was, like, the best night of my life. That was incredible. Oh, I-- I remember we were, like-- like, she got us seats right behind the stage, and she was nervous. We were all nervous. 'Cause, like, yeah, Springsteen was faced behind us. And-- But he would turn around every once in a while -and be like-- -[Elliot yells] Hey. He'd point right at us. Remember? He pointed at us, like, six times. And that guy right behind us got so jelly. Yeah, it was wild. Remember he put his head in the water and ate the sponge and everything? -That was crazy. -It was amazing. -Yeah. -Wait, this is-- I remember this now, this is where we would line up, right? And one at a time, he would come up and-- and, uh, do that thing. What's that thing? Oh, you're talking about the trust fall? -[Jonas] Yeah, yeah. -Yeah. [Jonas] Do you guys want to do it right now? -No. What are you doing? -[Jonas] What do you mean? Okay, what happens is I'm going to go back. No, no, we're not going to-- Please don't do it. -[Jonas] Ready? Three. -Jonas, no, no, no. I'm going to fall. I trust you guys. -[Jonas] Three. Two. -Jonas. Please, no. No. -No one's gonna catch you, man. -No, not now. Not right now. [Jonas] Wow. Good to know. Good to know I can't trust on you guys. -[Jonas sighs] -But how, uh-- You remember this classic, right?

[Jonas] You're collecting those? [Paloma] Yeah, I was thinking of making some bonsai trees, you know. You can almost make a bonsai out of anything. Even avocado pits. [Jonas laughs] Avocado bonsai? -[Paloma] Mm-hmm. -[Jonas] LOL. [Paloma] It only takes, like, four to six weeks to germinate, it's all. [Jonas] Huh. And, you know, before I left Singapore, uh, I saw some roots coming out of the crack of the avocado pit I planted, so I can't wait to go back and see how that's growing. You know, Sonoma really has a lot of potential. You guys are so lucky to be from here. Uh, I don't know about all that. I mean, yeah, we have, like, good hikes and stuff, but you guys have pretty cool hikes in, uh, Singapore, right? Uh, it's only 1% forest, so not really. -You say 1%? -Mm-hmm. Cringe. You-- you didn't really mean that right there when you said Sonoma being like a lukewarm bathtub, right? I totally meant that, 100%. You're into someone who's thinking of staying. -You're not serious, are you? -No, considering. -[Paloma chuckles] -[Jonas sighs] All right. I mean, if you want to clip your little wings and coop up here, that's on you. But, I mean, you didn't grow up here, so I, um-- I get it. But what about Elliot? -Ellie? -Mm-hmm. [sighs] Boy, if your wings are clipped, then that guy's are, uh-- I don't know, I shouldn't say anything. Say what? I-- I love him. He's-- he's my baby brother. I just-- I mean, he's been working at the same Pizza Shack uh, since high school, he just goes in day in and day out, over and over again, and I-- I-- That's unutilized potential. Pizza Shack? Like the Pizza Man? Yes, just like the Pizza Man. I think-- think he must have read into that song too hard, -Hmm. -But he's just-- I don't know, if he doesn't leave soon, they're going to put "Pizza Man" on his tombstone, and-- and he's too smart for that, you know? He's-- he's the smartest dumbass that I know. And he has more heart than everybody combined. I-- I-- -Do you ever tell him that? -No. Like, I-- I can't, 'cause you... you can't fix somebody who feels like they have to solve everything all the time. Like, who said anything about fixing? [Jonas sighs] [Elliot] No, that's perfect. I, uh, I really appreciate it. So, Miss Barnes, uh, has the address, and she'll just get in touch with you, okay? -[Jonas] No-- no way. -[Elliot] All right. -Have a good one. Goodbye. -[Jonas] Are you kidding me? This is so sick. This is it. This is lit. This is, uh-- [laughs] I'm-- I'm speechless. This is so serene. This is perfect for a video, man. Ellie, Ellie, take a video of me real quick, okay? Just take that, and make-- make sure it's vertical, though, 'cause, like, -you know how it goes. -Yeah, I don't think so, man. No, 'cause, like, horizontal doesn't work on Instagram. So just let me do one of these, like, "Hey, guys." [Elliot] Jonas, I'm not filming you. [Jonas chuckles] Why? I just don't want to contribute. You know, this isn't gonna be any different from any of your last videos. And, I don't know, suddenly, Sonoma's lit for you? Like, all day you've been trashing it. Now it's amazing? Is that how fake TikTok is? I guess you guys just do whatever the next trend is, right? Ellie, do-- Do you think you're better than me? No, I-- I don't think I'm-- No, I don't think I'm better than you. I just don't want to contribute, that's it. You can, but you won't. And that's the thing, it's the same thing with-- with-- with the trust fall and now this. It's, like, won't even just help me out a tiny bit. Yeah, but you won't come to Mom's funeral. I should have expected this. I-- I'm just asking you to do something for me that takes ten seconds. I was just trying to have fun, man. What, you're going to shrug your shoulders? Just stop being a bitch and take the video, all right? Paloma, can you help me real quick? -It will only take a second. -No, no, no, no. -Please don't drag her down-- -What is your problem, man? Why can't you just help me, your brother, with one thing? No, no, my problem is, is just that not everything's meant to be shared, Jonas. Like, you think I didn't hear you earlier today before we even started this hike? I mean, I just want to do this send-off. And not on my phone the whole time. Not on your phone, okay? -Please, just respect that. -Wasn't that you just a second ago making phone calls and shit? You know, that-- that was pretty sus if you ask me, right? That's different, 'cause it's business, okay? So is this. No, the business that you're talking about is just self-indulgent. It's like narcissistic behavior, okay? It's toxic. It's TikToxic. This is how I make money, okay? This is a real, true business. How do you think I got this jacket? -This is endorsements. -Yeah. I hope they gave you a receipt. Why would they give me a receipt? Like the sunglasses I have. If I do one more post, these are going to pay for themselves. It's... [chuckles] ...it's that simple. You're-- you're profiting off of Mom's send-off? -Are you serious? -No. I-- What would Mom think? Look, Mom would have been cool with it, okay? She always supported me, unlike... unlike some people in the family. [Elliot] Okay, you-- listen, Mom would've supported you if you had a tattoo of Nixon on your face, Jonas. I mean, if we were at that Bruce Springsteen concert today, man, I-- I-- I could see you now, you'd have a selfie stick. You'd be filming yourself at a concert. You know, if you film everything, not everything's sacred, man, I'm just saying that. You know, like, be here now, like Ram Dass? I have no idea what you're talking about, okay? You just say these names all the time. You're being so serious about something that's just supposed to be fun. The Internet is fun-- It's all fun and games, man, until you bring Mom into it. And what about her? It's okay to share Mom's death with a complete stranger, but I can't share her death with my fans, the people that care about me? -That follow me? -[Elliot] Oh, come on, man. When we literally have a complete stranger right there? -What-- what about her? -Look, man. It's-- it's different with Paloma, okay? Like, meeting her, that was an accident. A happy accident. Unlike you, man, everything you do it's self-- self-brought-on, it's premeditated. [chuckles] Premeditated. I mean, you remember what Mom said? I-- I'm sure I'm about to find out. "No sympathy for the self-inflicted wounds." It's funny, 'cause I-- I-- I do remember that. [chuckles] I remember, that was... that was, uh, right after you got your first hangover, right? When you were, uh, on your hands and knees in front of the toilet, and you were puking all day, and you were like, "Oh, God. Oh, please. Oh, I'm so sick. Poor me. Poor me." You know, you should actually film that. Like, that would be a good sketch for TikTok or whatever. You could be a real influencer in a second, man. [Elliot] Yeah, I'd rather do anything else but do what you do. As long as I still have my pride intact. Yeah, there's a lot of pride in pizza. You know, sometimes when I'm watching these videos, man, I don't even recognize you, you know, it's like, in your eyes. You know, it's like someone different. It's-- it's not my brother. You just don't get it. Truly, I mean, you-- you don't understand what it's like in LA. I dial myself. Like, everybody, everybody has that little dial, and, you know, they fit themselves to the situation they're in, I-- you do, too. When you're at work at the Pizza Shack, you're not the same person that you are here, right? Am I wrong? So I dial myself to "Jonas with the Mostest," and then, you know, when I'm here, I'm dialing myself to-- to fit this situation so that I can have fun with my baby bro, which is what I thought this day was going to be. You know, we could send Mom off right. [sighs] Figure out the affairs with the house, and-- and I just don't know what the big deal is, and why you take this shit so hard. I ju-- I just care about you. That-- that's all this is. Well, despite what you think... the video of Mom today is doing really well. It kind of blew up. [Elliot] I bet you can't go the rest of the day without being on your phone. [Jonas] Want to make it interesting? Wh-- what? You want to put money on it? -Yes, do a bet, come on. -Okay, $20. -50. -[scoffs] -All right. -Deal. Bet. [chuckles] $50. Paloma. Paloma? [birds chirping] [Elliot] Paloma. Hey, Paloma, hey. You don't know where you're going. That may be true, but I'm just through with you two. What? What? What are you talking about? My brother was killed in a car accident. Like, hit and run, just like that. You know what I would give to be with him again? Here or anywhere, for that matter. This trip was supposed to be for him and only him. But here I am with you two, and what do you do? You just keep barking and fighting with each other. You-- you have a chance to bond as brothers, to send off your mother the way she wished. But-- but instead, this is turning into some, like, deranged competition. I don't even know what to call it. Love? Do you call this love? I just can't take it anymore. I'm just going to go find my time capsule by myself. Thank you, uh, wherever this body of water may be. [soft instrumental playing] We did it, Mom. We made it. One way or another, we made it in one piece. You know, I know I'm going to forget something 'cause... I just always forget something. But whatever I'm going to say, I'm sure it was already said at the funeral, so I'm just going to say it. I'm really happy I could do this for you. And we could send you off right here at your lake, you know? Together. I miss you, Mom. And I love you. I love you a lot. [Elliot exhales] Goodbye. [Jonas sniffles] [Jonas chuckles] Um... Hi, Mom. [chuckles] I'm here. And I don't really know what to say. [clears throat] Um... You were the best mom that anyone could've hoped for. And you were always there for me. [sniffs] And I wasn't always there for you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't a better son. I'm sorry... I wasn't around more often. And, um, I don't know, I just want you to know that you... [sniffles and sighs] ...you were always-- always in my thoughts, and-- and you were in my heart. You know, being a biggest fan works both ways, right? Yeah. [sniffling] You, uh... you have... my whole heart. And I know-- I know you're around. I know you're here. I know you're here with me. And you're here with Ellie, and you-- you brought us back together again for this. And I'm-- I'm so thankful. [sniffs and sighs] I love you... so much, and thank you for-- for everything. -[kiss smacks] -[Jonas chuckles] [sobbing quietly] [clears throat] [exhales sharply] [sighs] [Jonas sighs] [both] One, two, three. [Jonas chuckles] Yeah! [both screaming in excitement] -[Jonas] Mom! -[both screaming in excitement] [Jonas] Love you, Mom. [Elliot] Love you. [Jonas] Duncan, my man. What's up? Did you, uh, did you have a good time at those meetings? [chuckles] So, yeah, that's why I-- I called, actually. I wanted to, um-- Duncan, uh-- [chuckles] Uh... [clears throat] [Jonas screaming] Fuck! [Elliot] What's up? Jonas. What's up? You good? You good? Jonas, what's going on, man? Talk to me. [groans, sighs] Hey guys, it's me, uh, Jonas with the Mostest, your, uh-- your boy. I'm, uh, still out in Slownoma. Look at this. It's a really nice lake. Very cool, just spread my mom's ashes into it. Or scattered, I'm not really sure of the difference. [chuckles] There's, uh, ducks in there, there's plants, there's everything you could want from a lake. So, there's that. Very cool. Hype. Whatever, lit. Not sure how much longer I'm gonna stay here. Almost back to LA, just gonna sell this house, and I'm on my way back, so see you then, cool. -Jonas out. -Yo, yo, yo, hey, hey, hey. -What are you doing? -[Jonas] What? Just let's-- let's just take a second, man. Take a se-- no, no, no, get out of my way, okay? No, no, what are you talking about? What is this? What do you mean? You're talking about selling the house for the whole world to hear, don't do that. No, that's money that's going to waste. Yuppies are going to buy it up, and I could use -that money right now, okay? -No, no, hey. That's-- that's not gonna happen. Mom gave me the house, Jonas. -Oh, she gave you the house? -I have-- I haven't told you-- Oh, she gave you the house? Ellie, that's not how it works. I'm the older brother. I get the house, all right? -Conversation over. -No, no, no. Hey. Sorry, Fredo. That's not the way Mom wanted it, all right? I was there to the end. I was there at the funeral. I was also there with the-- with the lawyer and the will. And don't forget, I was here for that, All right? That. -I'm pretty sure-- -Mom's dying-- No. Mom's dying wish. That's the only reason why you're here, right? If I wouldn't have called you, you wouldn't have been here, right? It's law of nature, baby bro. I'm the oldest one. I get the house. Now, can we be done here now? Oh, yeah, where'd you get your law degree? -Where'd you get it? -Stop pushing. Instagram? Is that where you learned everything? Is this really you, Jonas, with this jacket? Or is this just some arrogant dream that you made up in your mind, man? Like, "Like and subscribe and abandon Mom." -I said it, you abandoned her. -I didn't. I didn't abandon Mom. Well, she talked about you every day. Every day. You have no idea what it was like with the Alzheimer's, man, you have-- She was so far gone, man. She started mistaking me for you. You know what that's like? She'd look at me and call me Jonas. You talk about getting off this island of grapes, man, and you act like it's so easy. And you act like I never tried. I tried, man. I put down a deposit, I quit the Pizza Shack, and I was ready to move to Oakland. I had a nice spot lined up right by Lake Merit, man. You would have loved it. You know, Mom wasn't doing great, but... she was-- she was hanging in there. So I got a stay-at-home nurse, this nice lady named Irene. But then COVID hit. So Irene was out, and the Pizza Shack asked me back, and they offered me the GM job, and then Mom got worse. And you know how the story goes. But where were you? Where-- where were you? You're my brother. You were nowhere to be found. You were just on some D-level reality show, talking to 20-year-old girls, trying to ask which sorry soul -will date you next. -I wasn't-- I wasn't doing the dating thing. A dating show. [clears throat] I wasn't-- I wasn't even on camera. What? Then what-- then what's all this talk, Jonas? What-- then what-- what is this? I, um... I was on this, like, little web series thing. This little show that I did, so, yes, I did do something. [clears throat] I got followers from it and-- and a free lunch, and I-- I-- I guess, that was pretty cool. It was Chipotle, but, you know. [clears throat] And then, that guy Duncan, you know, hits me up, and he's talking about, like, how I could have my own show, and this time, I would be The Bachelor. You know, this time, I was gonna be the star, and, like, the girls were gonna want to, like, you know, have a date with me or whatever. And I was so excited. And I was going around telling everybody, uh, you know, posting about it online. I was hitting up, like, producers and stuff to try and get clout and everything, but... I don't know, apparently, you're not supposed to do that. I got in trouble, I had to take the post down, and... Uh, eventually, they went with a different influencer, uh, a real influencer, whatever-- whatever that means. And... I needed money. So I-- I asked and asked and I begged until they finally gave me a position on set. And I-- I ended up being a PA, which is, like, I don't know if you know, it's, like, bottom of the totem pole. You're like the-- the bitch ass production assistant, 16-hour days, driving these girls back and forth from the airport. I was ripping labels off of water bottles. Uh, I had to lock down sets, which took hours, and I never got even a thank you for it. [sighs] I don't know, it's just... belittling. But, you know, I, uh... I was on set, right? I can tell people back home I was on set. And eventually, the show shut down, unemployment burned out, so I needed to find a job. And, uh, you know, like Biggie said, "UPS is hiring," so-- so I did that. [clears throat] I did that. Wait, you worked at-- you work at UPS? You got the brown shorts and the-- and the socks and everything? [Jonas chuckling] Why does everybody ask that? No, I didn't do that, I was-- I was-- I was doing the conveyor belts. You know, taking boxes on and off, and on and off. [sighs] Basically, what I'm trying to say, Ellie, is that I'm broke. The only way I pay rent is by bumming off my girlfriend. And I don't know how much longer that's gonna last. I mean, if you want money, you can just ask me. -That's not a problem. -No, don't, Ellie. Don't do that, okay? You're my baby brother. And I thought-- you know, I thought that I was gonna have this opportunity. I thought Duncan was gonna help me out, but that-- but that check is straight bounced. [sighs] And I'm sitting in LA, broke, while these influencers are, like, shaking their ass in front of a ring light, and doing the-- the flossing thing or whatever's trending for ten seconds, and then boom, rent is paid for their-- their mansion in Calabasas. "Uh, who wants Postmates? I'm buying." [chuckles] So that's what you want? You want, like, that influencer life? No, I mean, not-- not exactly, no. Then what do you want, man? 'Cause, you know, everyone's extraordinary, you know? Not everyone knows it. Some more than others, you know, -but everyone is. -[Jonas chuckles] I mean, that's all there really is to it, man, that's life. [Jonas laughing] -What? -That's rich, Ellie. This Hallmark card supposed to make me feel better? Well, man, excuse me for trying to help. We spend a lot of time doing things we don't want to do. You know? And to be honest, man, no one cares about what anybody is even doing anymore. Everyone's too busy. I mean, UPS has benefits. It has a career path. And you could act on the side, so don't give me that. You could act on the side, and work at UPS. I-- I know they do that in Hollywood, man. -You've gotta hustle. -It's not what I want. -It's not what I want. -Then what is it for? I want dignity! Okay? I-- I want to feel... [clears throat] ...pride in what I do. Okay, I want-- I want to make Mom proud of what I do for once. And all this... taking boxes off of conveyor belts, and-- and-- and taking coffee orders from some kid who doesn't know the difference between a peach and a plum-- and that-- that's a true story, man-- that's-- that's not it. That's not what I want. What about the road to riches that you talk-- We ain't talking about the road to riches. I'm talking about... what you were saying, man, about that-- that money buys, you know, that road, you know, like the fortune cookie. Like-- like you were saying, man. I-- That's not any of this. I feel like a failure. -You're not a failure, Jonas. -I am. No, I am, and I-- I'm-- I had these big dreams, man. I had these big, Tinseltown Hollywood dreams. I was gonna be in-- I was gonna win an Oscar, and I was going to be-- all-- my-- my name in lights, and all the cheesy shit. And I've been out there for five years... and I don't-- I-- I haven't amounted to jack shit. No, for real, I-- I haven't done any of it. I'm just a PA, and that's like a glorified janitor. I let Mom down. -No, you didn't, man. -Yes, I did. -You didn't let-- -I did. I did. I told her I was gonna buy her a lake house, or-- and I was gonna put her in-- in my movies, and then I was gonna take her to the Oscars with me, which is so... dumb, thinking about it now. That's why I didn't go to the funeral. I was like, what-- what if little cousin Shay were to ask me a question about it? Or, like, you know, ask me how I'm doing out there, what-- what's going on there? I don't know how to bring up answers or, like, bring up excuses quick enough. I didn't take improv or whatever. So I blacked out my screen and-- I don't want anybody to see that I had this little shithole apartment in Hollywood. Just, like, this closet size, embarrassing piece of shit. No one cares about your apartment. -Yes, they do. -No, you think that. You think that, but we don't, man. We just want to see you. I want to see you. I don't care if it's over Zoom or anything. I just-- we just want to see you. I know you want to see me, and I wanted to be there, but there was a global pandemic. So what do you want me to tell you? There were the most deaths in COVID history that day. Just like today, Jonas, and just like tomorrow, man, it's a pandemic. You're always shoving shit in my face, okay, man? Just be on my side for once. Oh, how can I be on your side if you can't be on Mom's? What do you call all of this? I call this "bootleg charity," Jonas. It's-- You're pathetic. I'm not pathetic. I'm not pathetic. I was being cautious, okay? And I don't expect you to understand that, 'cause you're in your safe little bubble where there's, like, ten people. So nobody's going to get COVID. But I was in a hot zone where they're telling us every day that if you're around elders, they could get sick. -Didn't wanna do that to Mom... -[Elliot] Oh, come on. Don't even try to blame COVID. ...or do that to anybody else in the family. [Elliot] You haven't been home since Dad died. I guess you did mean every word you said out there, huh? You don't deserve Mom. You don't deserve to show your face. And I guess now, you don't deserve the house. [Jonas exhales sharply] Wow. I don't deserve the house. How humbling. [imitates retching, chuckles] I'm gonna get that house, Ellie. Whether you like it or not, the house is gonna be mine. [Elliot] Yeah, over my dead body, Jonas. I have a realtor, and I'm fixing the place up, and we're gonna get someone in there, and I'm gonna make some money, and I'm gonna get out of here, and I'm gonna go to Oakland, all right? Wow, you have a realtor. Yeah, I bet you don't even know what a realtor does. You better start telling that realtor that we're going to sell it, 'cause I need that that money so I can make a movie, and get-- get out-- I won't have to answer to Duncan or anybody else, okay? -[Elliot] "Jonas." -What? "Jonas," that's all I hear, it's just "Jonas." Is that all you ever think about? It's just you and your LA life? Is that all -that ever goes around? -Oh, God. You just love shoving LA in my face. Remember, I-- I-- I asked you to come out and crash with me. And you were too scared, too shook to-- to-- to come out to see me, to see your brother. But you made up all these little excuses. That's pathetic. I don't have to put up with this. -All right? -I don't care. [Elliot] I don't, man. You know what? Here. It's a lawyer. Call her. Ask her any question you want. It's not my problem. She can answer all your questions. I'm done with you. [Jonas sniffling] [sniffling] You're not going to believe this, but I do love you. When we were kids, man, I-- I remember seeing you in that show, The Taming of the Shrew, and I remember thinking, "Yeah. He'll go far, you know, you got talent." If you just tried to be real for once, organic, maybe you wouldn't look for admiration in everything. Yeah. Says the guy who does nothing but watch old movies every damn day, right? [Elliot] Says "Jonas with the Mostest." Not referring to brain cells there, right? You didn't get out of Sonoma, you ran away. You're a walking contradiction. Every time you visited, I saw you slowly dwindle away. The outfits, they got more extravagant. The excuses, second nature. Only showing your face when you get paid, right? You're nothing but a hack, Jonas. A worthless hack. Mom used to always say to me, "The hardest thing in life is accepting the choices of others." And I guess-- I guess... I just got to listen to Mom, and I got to let go. [sighs] Wow. High and mighty are we? Elliot, the prodigal son. [Elliot] Do you even know what you're saying? Do you? You just-- I'm done here. I'm done. Hey, uh, before you go, why don't you check in that urn real quick? See if there's any of Mom's ashes left, so maybe you can curl up next to her and cry like the good old days. Yeah, why do you think that is, Jonas? You ever wonder why I fell into that role, huh? Why? I was up with her all night the night you got your stomach pumped after homecoming, you remember? And then the following weekend you didn't come home. And so, Mom, you know, she just loved you unconditionally, no matter what. So, yeah, I fell into that role. Or I cuddle up with her, watch West Wing, Gilmore Girls, and I kayaked with her on this lake. 'Cause I was a good son. I was a good son. And you can't take pride in yourself, if you can't take pride in your own blood. It's that simple. There's actually a funny story about that. Let me tell you, baby bro. It was, uh... a long time ago now. I-- I was six, so, you must have been, like, four. I don't know if you remember this, but, uh, Mom had just finished making this apple pie. And it was just sitting there, getting cold. And, uh, Mom and Dad got into one of their shouting matches, which they always did and... you and I were sitting on those two stools. Remember the ones on the counter? And, uh, Mom was crying... and you were crying. And I was thinking that... Dad was mean. And Mom was weak. And that image is still stuck in my brain. There was that cold apple pie just sitting there. [sighs] That's when I knew I wanted to do something. Do something else. Make something in my life. So, what, you decided at age six that you weren't gonna be a part of our family anymore? You said it, man, not me. It's kind of funny that you keep bringing up pride and stuff like that. You have that compass around your-- around your waist. Attached to the hip with another man's trash. Oh, you didn't know? I didn't want to say anything, but I guess... I guess now is the right time. That compass that you hold so dearly... it's nothing but a scam. I was with Mom when she, uh, when she found that piece of shit. [chuckling] Yeah, yeah. Right, uh... Oh, you probably thought that was, like... something important, I don't know, some sentimental gift to our family. No, it's not. It's just something Mom found on the side of the road. I was with her when-- we were on a walk, and it was just sitting on the side of the road, like roadkill. She cleaned it up, and she put it in a stocking for Christmas. It was just supposed to be like a little, like, "Ha, ha, ha, ha," you know. Don't get stuck on Half Dome again. You remember what happened last time. And that was it. That's all it was supposed to be. And I remember Dad... was in the kitchen, after we were done unwrapping presents and stuff, and he-- he was making Bloody Marys. And e handed it to me and he said... "Real men know where they're going. So pawn this off for some gas money." And I just threw it in the closet, like a piece of junk. And I-- I'd forgotten about it until I saw it today. I-- I was trying not to laugh. 'Cause, like, you were walking around, wearing it all proud and stuff. So cringy. Wearing it like some dipshit badge of honor, like you're in Cub Scouts or something. You're going on about your little fairy tale, about how you're gonna go to Oakland, and have this hipster cool life, watch old movies, and do all this Ellie stuff, art stuff, when you have-- when you've barely been outside the 707, man. I mean, do you know how hard it is not to laugh in your face? All day, you just keep saying these things, and I-- I-- I just-- It's embarrassing. You should be embarrassed. [laughing] And I just know that this is-- this is what it is for you. COVID was a blessing. I mean, COVID must have been actually a blessing for you. You-- you can sit here, and-- and do the same thing day in and day out, and when anybody asks, you could just say, like, "Oh, you know, trying to stay safe." When really, this is all you have. [chuckles] That's your sad little life. [laughing] I-- I'll tell you what, okay. Because I'm being nice, and I feel, you know, sympathetic, empathetic, you probably know the difference. [clears throat] Because I'm feeling nice, I'm gonna let you rent the house for me, okay? And so, I make some money off you, and then you just live your sad, sad little life in Slownoma, doing the same thing, day in and day out. Sad little Ellie life. How's that? Is that good for you, bud? Ellie. Ellie. Who's the hack now, huh? You little twerp, think you're so funny. -[both groaning] -[Elliot] What are you doing? [Jonas] You think you're so funny. -[Elliot] Hey! -[Jonas] You little twerp. Do you know why I had to get out? Because Mom and Dad always said I needed to be like you, okay? "9:00 to 5:00 Ellie. Be just like Ellie." Pretentious little Ellie -with nothing going on. -[Elliot groaning] -His little life. -Hey. I wanted to be more, man. I wanted fans. -And I have fans. -[Elliot] Jonas! I'm Jonas with the Mostest and I have friends. I have followers. I have influence. People like me, they don't like you. You're just a bitch-ass twerp. -You little-- -[Elliot] No. No. No. No. You have nothing. -Except for your little house... -[Elliot] Jonas! ...that's gonna be your coffin, you're nothing. You're nothing, Ellie. You're nothing. You're nothing. You're nothing. You're just a hack. -[Elliot groaning] -Just a hack. [Jonas panting] [Elliot coughing] [Elliot] Jonas! Jonas! No, no, no. Jonas! Jonas! No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. [Elliot panting] Oh. Jonas.
