And I just keep on thinking about her, and it just keeps going through my head over and over. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I do want to talk about it, all right? Look, it happened, it's over. I've been thinking about it for years. And, I mean, we were young, but I remember just about everything that happened. And, you know, I just can't for the life of me remember shooting her, now. HAUSER: I don't want to talk about her anymore. And I do! Just forget it, man. Now, I was in the bathtub. Now in the hell did I shoot her? Forget it, it's over. It wasn't me, was it? Was it? [TIRES SCREECHING] You answer me. Don't give me that shit, man. You knew. You knew. How did you... Why did you let them think that I shot her? I was protecting you. I couldn't watch her touch you anymore. I killed her for you. I covered you, you covered me, that was the game, remember? Remember? The game? The game. [BOTH LAUGHING] [GUNSHOT] [SIREN BLARING] Dad, no! [INAUDIBLE] ASHLEY: Daddy! Daddy! CLIFF: You got a radio? I need a radio. Daddy! What do you think?

And my hostage, well, she'd like to go on Space Mountain, only she doesn't want to wait in line. Now, besides that, we'd kind of like the roadblock cleared, that way nobody else will have to die. Okay? Huh? You got that? Now you got 30 seconds to clear that road bloc or I'm going to drive right up your butts. Clear the roadblock! Ain't that sweet, Jack? So good to hear your voice. Hey, Jack, you know much about electronics? It takes two wires to make something like, say, a light bulb work, right? Takes a positive wire and a negative wire. Well, I'm that negative wire, Jack, you see? I help power that light bulb. I help bring light into the world. I'm needed. [ENGINE STARTS] Fuck! Come on, go! Move! He's coming fast!
