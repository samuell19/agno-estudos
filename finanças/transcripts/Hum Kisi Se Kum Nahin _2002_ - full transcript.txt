Janu uncle has come. Bhai getting down the stairs looks like an English movie's hero. He is sitting in Gafoorbhai's hotel. "- Uncle, Pillai here. - Tell me." - Did you speak to Munnabhai? - I am waiting for him. "Don't worry, I don't think he will go against my word." "Yes uncle, even I want Munnabhai and my enmity to end forever." "That's in everyone's interest, son." I see him coming. I'll speak to him and get back to you. "- Yes uncle, but please do my job. - I'll disconnect now." "- Welcome, son. - Greetings, uncle." You look so good. I feel happy to see you. Your father and me were best friends. "However big a man you become, I'll always consider you my kid." Those were such good times. "Son, the police is your biggest enemy." Why make enemies with your business colleagues? "Uncle, are you talking of Pillai?" "Munna, atleast listen to me." "Uncle, I won't spare him!" "He worked under me, now he wants to be my boss?" - He wants to run his own gang? - He made a mistake. He wants to work with you now. - I have settled everything. - You don't know him. He is evil. He's a crooked man. "I have given him my word, son." Atleast respect my word. Please give your consent. Talk to him. "Alright, ask him to work for me, work under me." "Bless you, son! May God give you a long life." "Wasn't Bhai right, uncle. See, he shot at you." Where is Pillai? Speak! You moron! How do you shoot? "The one you had to kill, didn't die. Where are you now?" - Come and meet me right away! - I am in hiding. - Where are you? - I am on Bandra Kurla road. Stay there! I'm coming. "- Who are you? - Your father, Munna!" The dog is with Munna? How do you drive! Stop it! Don't you feel ashamed? How can you beat anyone so brutally? Don't you have any manners? Is this what your parents have taught you? To barge in anywhere and beat up anyone? Look how scared everyone is. Say sorry to all of them. "Didn't you hear me? I said, say sorry!" "Bhai, what happened to you?" Are you alright? "Munnu, Bhai has apologized to someone for the first time." - Why don't you speak? - Cat got your tongue? Put him in the lock-up. "- I just cannot believe this, sir. - Believe what?" "The Pillai, who the entire department was trying to arrest..." ...was caught so easily? This is a big victory for us. Come in. "Shinde, do you think the police caught him?" "- Then who caught him, sir? - No one, he got himself arrested." "You mean, deliberately? But why?" "He plotted an attack on Munna yesterday, but Munna survived." He knows there's no safer place than the police lock-up to escape Munna. So he got himself arrested by the police. "Or just think, the one who the police is looking for since so many days..." "...would he get caught so easily? That too, near the police station?" The entire city knows Munna is the top Don of the underworld. He runs a parallel government in Mumbai. Yet the police takes no action against him. "Only when we have evidence & witness against someone, can we take action." But we don't get any evidence or witness against Munna. That is why he operates fearlessly in the city. Even now he must be pressurizing someone. "Move aside! Bhai is coming. Come, Bhai." "Hey, vacate the chairs! Come on, out!" Take your bag! Who are you? What are you doing here? Keep your volume and head down while talking. Munnabhai has come! "Your brother, Pillai, came to kill me. Instead, Janu uncle died." What will become of his wife and children now? "From today, Janu uncle's family inherits..." "...your building, your construction company. Understand?" "Come on, sign the papers." All your property now belongs to Janu uncle's family. "- Munna, you are not doing right. - Just sign the papers!" I won't sign! What had I told you? But you did not understand. You will pressurize people? You will misbehave? You will kill?! "You should not do that, Munna. Come on, say sorry." "I said, say sorry!" It happens. Don't think you have escaped. Thank your stars that Bhai is not in the right mood today. "The day Bhai is in the right mood, he'll kill you!" Don't move! Give me all that you have in your pocket! "Listen brother, please don't kill me." "What are you waiting for? Give me your valuables, quick!" "Yes, I am giving you. This key..." Hey! You have very high fever. That is why I was looting you. What do you mean? I have fever since three days. I have no money to eat or see a doctor. I was forced to do this. Please don't hand me over to the police. Calm down. I won't hand you to the police. Come here. Lie down here. Don't move. Breath deeply. Through your mouth. "- What's going on here, brother? - Komal! Open my bag." Quick. The poor guy is very sick. Remove my prescription pad. Open your mouth... tongue. "You have a throat infection, that is why you have high fever. Get up." I am prescribing three medicines for you. Take two at night before sleeping. And take one after meals. "How will you eat? You have no money. Wait, I'll give you money." "Eat food, and buy medicine." "This is your prescription, and this is my card." See me after three days. "- Sir, you are an angel! - Hey! Don't do that." "Thank you, doctor." "Brother, you are a doctor, not some juggler..." ...that you start performing on the street. - He had come to loot me... - Loot? You should have handed him over to the police! He was helpless. He was not feeling well. I have treated him. He won't loot anyone now. "Brother, you are great." "Komal, give me your passport when we reach home." I want to apply for a Visa for Malaysia. Malaysia? How come you made this sudden programme of going to Malaysia? "I have a friend there, Dr. DD. He had called." "He has invited us. I thought we could tour Malaysia, and..." He has a son. Even he is a doctor. I thought if you met him... ...you could tell me if you like him... as a groom. - Marriage? I won't marry. - Why? You will marry some day. - I only want you to meet him. - But I'll have to miss classes. What about my students? "Oh, so you are more worried about your classes, not your brother?" "Munnu, go and check who banged into our car." Check if everything is okay in the dickey. Excuse me. Are you blind? You banged into a stationary car. "Forgive me, it's my mistake. One must not talk while driving." Let's call the police. "Since you have accepted your mistake, we'll let go." But the police... Why call the police for a small collision? There must be a garage around here. We'll have it repaired at the garage. I'll pay the damages. "- We don't want any damages. - No, whatever the damages..." Why are you after us? We said we don't want compensation. "- Alright, here's my card. - Okay, give." - His name is Dr. Rastogi. - My clinic address is given below. "If ever you change your mind, come to the clinic and take money from me." - If ever you change your mind... - Go away! "In a police-underworld encounter in Sion-Koliwada today..." ...two shooters were killed. It is being said that both these shooters belonged to Munna gang. "Munna, who is an underworld don." Munna's increasing activities have put the police & government in a fix. - Who's calling? - Arora Builder. "Bhai, call from Arora Builder." "Why you rogue, you started construction of your building..." ...without paying us? - I want 40 million now. - But you had demanded 20 million. That was before you started construction. "Now that you have started construction..." ...you'll have to pay a fine of 20 million. "Bhai, it is too much, I will be ruined." "Hey! Your kids go to school, don't they?" "Tell me, when do I kill them?" Stop it! You should feel ashamed of yourself! You will extort money? You will kill people's wife and kids? "Come on, say sorry. I said, say sorry!" Say it! "What's wrong with Bhai? He was threatening, & suddenly he said sorry?" This is a big problem. Our business is being ruined. - Or Bhai saying sorry? - He has started day-dreaming. We'll have to think of something. Stop it! Don't you feel ashamed? How can you beat anyone so brutally? Don't you have any manners? Is this what your parents have taught you? To barge in anywhere and beat up anyone? You will extort money? Say sorry to him! What happened? Who is it? I'll kill you! "Bhai, sit down, don't move. Close the window." "- What happened, Bhai? - Nothing." - Sure? - Sure. All of you leave. Then why did you shoot? "Who fired the shot? Tell me, I'll kill him!" - I fired the shot. - Don't cry. "I'll close the window. If anyone sees this..." ...our reputation will be ruined. I'm going mad! I cannot sleep. I see strange dreams. "Bhai, you really are sick. We'll have to take you to the doctor." Then take me. "Munnu, I cannot bear to see Bhai like this." We want a good doctor! Nothing is wrong. He's only suffering from stress and anxiety. - What's anxiety? - His brain is tired due to over work. That is why he feels nervous and scared. Looks like some fear within him is bothering him. I am scared? I am nervous? Do you know who I am? The whole city fears him and you say he is scared? - But... - Wait a minute. "This is fear, what I see on your face now." "Doctor, you give pills to everyone, now take Bhai's pill (bullet)." You are a stupid doctor. Don't see any patients. Sit down! "Stand up! I am standing, and you dare to sit?" "Munnu, Bhai is walking in tension." "Bhai, there is no need to worry. We'll go to a good doctor." "Bhai, I just remembered! The guy who had banged into our car..." ...had given me his card. We'll go to him. "He's a good doctor, very tall. We'll go to him." Your blood sugar level is high. Did you have too many sweets? - He had them just yesterday. - I just ate some oblation. "Then you should have eaten little, not made a meal of it." "I am tired of him, doctor. Lf I cook diet food at home, he eats in a hotel." Have you brought me here for a check-up or to complain about me? Listen! Don't take my words so lightly. "If you don't control your diet, you'll have to take insulin." I'll check your blood sugar right now. "Come on, get going!" Who are you? "- Hello, doctor. - You... it's you!" That small accident on the street... I had said we'll go to the police. "Infact, I had even offered to go to the garage." You only said you didn't want to go. - The car... - We have brought a patient. It's an emergency case. Where is the patient? What? He didn't give 5 million? "Look, if he doesn't give it by evening, pump 6 bullets into him." You see him as an emergency case? "He looks so healthy, he's walking, and you call him an emergency case?" "You mean, only if he comes on a stretcher, he's an emergency case?" If he is bleeding... "Look, I don't need to hear your nonsense!" - Please go out! - Just a sec... see you in the evening. "You go out and wait in queue, and come in when it's your turn." - Hey! There is no queue. - Everyone left on seeing him. They left on seeing him? Who is he? Who are you? Are you a don... are you... - You are... - Munnabhai. Yes... Munnabhai... you are right. "Why will you wait outside, you'll come in. Come inside." "Why did you bother? You should have called me, I'd come to you." Come here. Why are you standing? Sit down. ...why am I sitting? You sit. You also sit down. "Tell me, what can I do... I mean, what problem do you have?" "Doctor, I have a friend. He's into my kind of business." - He's shaken since two days. - Shaken? Sick. "I'm sorry, I didn't know you were..." It's okay. Sick? Men in your business also fall sick? Your friend is sick. Some people fall sick on seeing you. "By the way, what's his problem?" "Two days ago, he met an item." "Since then, he's finished." - Tell him. - He sees only that girl everywhere. "He sees her in his dreams. He opens his eyes, and finds her before him." "However hard he tries, but she refuses to go." His business is suffering. - He cannot kill anyone. - He cannot even beat. - He cannot shoot. - Enough. I think his condition is very serious. "But you are the doctor, you know best." "Yes, I am the doctor." - Nothing is wrong with him. - How can you say there is no problem? He cannot sleep all day and you say nothing is wrong with him. "His heart beats fast, his hands tremble, his body shivers." I didn't mean to say he is not sick. "Listen... this friend of yours, is he married?" - No. - Any girl... He is not involved with any girl. He is a straight guy. Your friend's... this girl... how does she look? She's beautiful! "She has blue eyes, golden hair." I think he has not seen a more beautiful girl than her. Your friend is suffering from a beautiful ailment. An ailment which every person waits for. Your... come here. Your friend is suffering from love. I'll tell you one more thing in confidence. Your friend is none other than you. He's a great doctor. I'm not that good... I said you are good! I'll be going now. Thank you. Bye. Let's go. "You are very intelligent, smart, handsome." Sorry... I forgot to add... tall too. "Nurse, check my blood pressure." "- Teacher, I am Munnu Mobile. - And I am Pappu Pager." - Tell me. - Bhai has fallen in love with you. - So we have come to take you. - Sorry for the inconvenience. - What are you doing! - Shouting will not help. Come to Bhai and settle everything amicably. "- Bhai, we have brought your girl. - Without any damages." Congratulations! You! I knew you were a goon! Don't you dare abuse Bhai! You don't call him Bhai(brother). Or how will he have his honeymoon with you? "Forget loving such a goon, I wouldn't even hate him!" "- What happened, Bhai? - Did you dream of her again?" - She slapped you? - Yes. She is proving difficult for you now. We'll pick her up right now! "No, picking girls is not our job." "This is not our cup of tea, the doctor will give us a solution." How long since you gave anesthesia to the patient? About 3-4 minutes. "- Doctor, come. - What are you doing here?" - Bhai is waiting outside. - But this is an operation theater. How did you enter here? "Patient, get up, your operation is through." "He is unconscious, how will he get up?" "He is only unconscious, but it's a question of life and death for Bhai." - He'll die. - What about his life? Just come! Do whatever you want to with him. - I don't want to hear anything. - My patient is on the operation table. "- Look, there's Munnabhai. - Munnabhai, what is this!" - Will you allow me to work or not? - Even this is work. "Yes, it is... what is your problem?" "You told me I'm suffering from love, but you didn't tell me it's cure." "Oh yes, I didn't. Look, a person who is in love..." ...his cure is also love. What do you mean? Do you know anything about the girl you love? - No. - Then try to know her. Try getting close to her. Try wooing her. Try to impress her. "As she gradually comes closer, your ailment will gradually disappear." You are great! "Bhai will woo her, impress her, take her on a date." "- He'll even sing. - I'm going, my operation is held up." Let's hug. He's a great doctor! "You will be fine now, won't you?" "Yes, I'm already relieved." "- You? - You teach dancing, don't you?" - Yes. - Teach me too. - You? - Why? Won't I be able to learn? At your age? Am I too old? Age is never a barrier for learning. - It's good that you are interested. - That means you will teach me. "I will, but after I come back from my holiday of 15-20 days." "Bhai, the girl touched your cheek!" "She touched your cheek today, tomorrow, she'll touch your lips." "I don't know to speak English, but I can surely understand it." She said 'I like you.' "- Like means, she likes him! - Congratulations, Bhai!" "Yes, tell me. Munnubhai, my love affair has clicked" "Munnubhai, my love affair has clicked!" "Right you are, friend!" "Hey Munna Mobile, hey Pappu Pager" "Hey Ulhasbhai, my love affair has clicked" "All morning and evening, roams the love bug in my heart" "She's the bird I've fallen in love with" "Right you are, friend!" I am the top don among goons To get me is every girl's dream "Your youth is short-lived, princess" Why don't you understand this "Hey Gullu Gotya, listen Dagdu Dhakkan" "Hey Pakyabhai, I'm going to enjoy life now!" "All morning and evening, roams the love bug..." She's come! "In the neighbourhood, they call me a hero" I am the talk of the town "But what lures me, what torments my heart every moment" "That style of yours is unique" "Hey Rambo Rifle, listen, Hanif Hatele" "Hey Gafoorbhai, I will marry her now" "All morning and evening, roams the love bug..." My love affair has clicked! - Get up! - What about my check-up? - Go out. - I'm through with you. "- My blood pressure, doctor. - It's normal." - How is that possible. - Go to some other doctor. "Munnabhai... Why are you standing? Come, sit down." "So tell me, did you get the girl?" "Doctor, I met her. She even touched my cheek." My blood froze. But she said she is going out for 10-15 days. - I couldn't say a thing. - Doesn't matter. "If she has gone out, she will come back." "What are you saying? What about me, what about my business?" "Look, you are a doctor. If you fall sick, who will treat your patients?" Even mine is a similar case. "My job is to beat, threaten, break bones." "But nowadays, I am neither able to threaten, nor use the gun." "Earlier, I could fire with my eyes closed." "Now, I miss target even with closed eyes." Look. "- Look, my hands are trembling. - I can see that." "- I'll target you, but miss. - Hey no! Why will you fire at me?" - Just check this out. - No! "Yes, you missed target. Put the gun down." Did you carry your revolver when you went to meet the girl? - Yes. - Then how will you get her? "When you go to meet a girl, you should carry flowers, not a gun." Keep this revolver here. - Is this the only one or... - Here. Keep it here. Anymore? Look for it. Keep that too over here. "One, two, three. Is that all?" - This... - Oh... keep it here. That's all. "Look, I am giving you this flower." Meet the girl. Give her sweet romantic talk. "- Talk like humans. - Doctor, I can do anything for her." "But tell me, I will get her, won't I?" Why won't you get her? Ofcourse you will get her. "You are very nice, doctor. Shall I go?" - Where are you? - I am outside the doctor's clinic. - But Munna is still inside. - He should not escape today. "Kill him, but before he dies, ensure he knows Pillai got him killed." "- Right? - I'll do just that, brother." "Brother, I think he is coming." "Hey Munna, think you are a top don?" "You will listen today! You will kill my brother, Pillai?" You will snatch our business? You will transfer our property in Janu uncle's name? Shooting going on here? Where is the camera? Who is the hero? Get lost! Real shooting is going on here. Real shooting doesn't happen in the open like this. "Are you a TV serial actor, or a film actor?" - Get lost! - This is real shooting! About which I read in the newspapers. Pardon me! "Doctor, will I get her?" Munna escaped me because of you! - Is this yours? - Yes. "- Is this real or a toy? - It is real, and loaded." Why should I believe you? I'll fire and check. "- If it goes off, it's real, or... - Don't shoot!" "Hey, your gun! ...it's real!" "Stop eating, and also stop playing." - What's going on here? - Munnabhai is coming here. "- So? - Where Munnabhai comes, everyone leaves." - No one will leave. Remain seated. - What did you say? "- Hey, let everyone stay. - Hey you!" Talk respectably with Munnabhai. "- He is Munnabhai? - Yes, he is Munnabhai, the don." "Raja, my life was saved because of you yesterday." I owe you one. "You do, don't you? But see how your men are threatening me." I'll bash! Ask for whatever you want. "I saved your life, and I should ask for something?" The saviour is greater than the slayer. So who is greater? I have no one in the world. I teach the kids to play in this club. I don't want anything. But I have something to give you. How dare you aim a revolver to Bhai! I am giving it to him. It belongs to the one who tried to kill you yesterday. "If anyone complains, I'll fall into trouble..." ...for possessing an illegal weapon. Keep this. "Alright, whenever you need me, just give me a call." "Alright, Bhai." "Bhai, if you permit, can I play a game?" - What nonsense he talks! - Play. Enjoy. You teach delicate girls. Teach me to play too. - This is heavy! - Play. "- Bhai, look who is here! - Hello Commissioner!" "Commissioner, you are so fortunate. Munnabhai is greeting you." Or the whole city greets Munnabhai. "Munna, you are very proud of your power?" "Commissioner, you take pride in your uniform..." ...I take pride in my power. - That's quits. Perhaps you are not aware of the power of law. "Law? Bhai, we seem to have heard that word." What is this law? - I think it's that... - A lady carrying weighing scales. That lady which carries a weighing scale and is blindfolded? Blind law! There even was film by that name. "Yes, in which Amitabh Bachchan starred." "- Blind law. - Law is not blind, Munna." It is you people who are blind that you cannot see law. "Lost in the high of your power, you spread crime in the city." I spread crime? "Commissioner, arrest me. Take me to court." - Where is the proof? - Get proof. You have no proof. "So many Commissioners came and went, but I am where I always was!" But I won't leave until I have arrested you. "Commissioner, the day you collect witnesses & evidence against Bhai..." "...that day, Bhai will himself come to you. That's a promise!" - Dr. Rastogi? - Yes speaking. - Hello. - Hello. Who's calling? "Sir, I am a great fan of yours." - Is it? - You are very nice. - You are great. - Thank you. But your sister is better than you. - Hey! Who are you? - Your future brother-in-law. - I'll kill you! - And widow your sister? "Brother, I am going for classes." You?! I came to meet the doctor. The rogue! Where do they get the numbers from? "What is the matter, doctor? You look upset." Wonder who he is. He talks nonsense about Komal over the phone. The rascal! "- You didn't do right, doctor. - Why?" You didn't mention this to me. You don't consider me close to you. "Don't be ridiculous, you are like a family member." A boy is troubling you and you didn't even tell me? "I have no one. Whenever I have suffered from cold, cough, Malaria..." ...you have treated me for free. Can't I do even this much for you? I know how to deal with such ruffians. "Yes, Raja will set him right in a jiffy! Am I right?" "If it's his call, let me talk to him." Why do you trouble brother so much? He is my brother-in-law. I have that right over him. - So you complain about me to people? - You again! How do you know? I even know your sister is going for her classes. "This time, I'll kidnap her, marry her, and come to take your blessings." I'll shoot you! Give the phone to me. Who is it? I'm Raja. "Yes, alright." - What happened? - He was talking of kidnapping Komal. - Oh my God! - Don't worry. "I will drop Komal to her classes, and also go to pick her up." "- Brother, you don't worry. - How can I not worry?" "Who is he? Is he a goon, or an underworld don? I'm scared!" "Trust me. Don't worry. Come, Komal." "O dream merchant, give me a dream" "If you want a dream, give me your heart" Oh my God! "If your dream is so expensive, give me a bangle" "If you want a bangle, give me your hand" O dream merchant... "In this deal of love, don't cheat me" "If you think I'll cheat, don't deal with me" Shall I trust you "Yes, trust me" "If that's the case, why just my heart, take my life" O dream merchant... A paper flower never blooms "One doesn't get anything for free in this world" There is a price tag for everything But love is priceless Then... "If that's the case, why just a dream, take everything I have" O dream merchant... - So you are going with doctor to Malaysia? - Yes. "I don't feel like going, but brother is insisting." - I'll set him right. - You started it again! - Doctor! - You! Tell me! - You are very nice. - And you are a rascal! Must you abuse your future brother-in-law? I have heard you are taking my future wife to Malaysia. Who told you I am going to Malaysia? You atleast accepted Komal is my future wife. "I didn't accept it. Look, I won't tolerate your nonsense." I am coming after you to Malaysia. I will marry Komal there. You're coming after me? Shut-up! Now watch how your brother takes me to Malaysia. "What is the matter, doctor? You look very upset." I'm very tensed. How does this phone guy come to know everything about us? He is a very dangerous kind of man. He knows that we are going to Malaysia - Such lovers are very dangerous. Have you seen 'Darr'. - No. - They can even kill. - What! Do one thing. Leave Komal behind. "No, how can I leave her here?" "If he comes to know I am alone, he can do anything." "Doctor, you don't understand. You're a decent man." What if he confronts you in Malaysia? Why don't you take someone along? That's a good idea. But... who? Are you trying to say that I should come along? That's exactly what I was thinking. "No, I am a busy man." "Oh yes, why will you do anything for us? Forget him." "Look, if you come along, it will give us moral courage." "We will feel more secure. And then, you will even get to see Malaysia." Is it? ...Here's my passport. Thank you. - You! - I went to the dispensary. They told me you are going abroad. - Yes. - But what about me? - I'll inform you when I return. - Where are you going? "I'm sorry, I cannot tell you where I am going." "Give me the telephone number, the address of that place." What if my condition becomes serious? "There are so many other doctors, go to them." I want to live in peace for 15-20 days. So I cannot tell you where I am going. - Doctor! - Malaysia... I am going to Malaysia. I'll know my room number on reaching there. And my mobile will be on. "You are very nice, doctor." Here's the reception. Single room? How will you stay in a single room? "You'll stay in the single room, the suite is for us." - Where are you going? - Back to India. Why? Didn't you like this hotel? "I didn't like the room. You will stay in a suite, & I in a single room?" "Am I your servant? I have come here to help you, for her sake." As her bodyguard. I am leaving. I'll rectify it. Thanks doctor! I'm enjoying for free. I'll thank him. "So doctor, you have reached Malaysia?" You!! How did you reach here? Like you have. I've heard you have brought along a bodyguard. "Even if you appoint 10 such bodyguards, you cannot do anything." I will marry your sister right here! "What happened, brother? He has come here too?" "Yes, and he already knows the hotel and room number..." See! He's called again. What do you think? That I will get my sister married to you? - Is that Dr. Rastogi? - Yes. "And if I come across you, I'll kill you." "Look, you brought the proposal to me, not I." Who... Dr. DD? "I'm sorry, I was a little confused. Someone is troubling me on the phone." "- But who knows you here? - No one, but..." I'll explain to you in the evening when Komal and I come to meet you. "What days those were! We were hostel mates, did our MBBS together." "Now you are in India, and I am here." "And now, from old friends, we are going to become relatives." "Tell me, why didn't you ever marry? Even you would have children." "I have Komal. She is not my sister, she is like my daughter." "If you have a girl in mind for brother, get him married first." What nonsense are you talking! Is this an age to get married? "Hey, forget it. You get annoyed very easily." You were even yelling over the phone today. "Oh yes, explain that phone incident." "You know how Indian, or you can say Mumbai lovers are." There is one such lover who calls for Komal and troubles us. "When you called, I thought it was him." Come on! How can he call here? "- You didn't introduce him. - I'm Raja, his & Komal's bodyguard." You know the situation in Mumbai these days. So I thought of appointing a bodyguard. "He is a nice guy, and lives in the neighbourhood." "And then I thought, even he can tour Malaysia." You look very simple folks to me. "Especially, you are very nice." I am thinking of telling him. What? You are inviting trouble by getting into this alliance. A Mumbai don has fallen for Komal. He has warned the doctor that if she is married elsewhere... ...the groom will be... "- Mama, come here. - What is it, son?" - That bodyguard told me everything. - Told you what? He said that a Mumbai don has fallen for Komal. "And he has said that whoever marries Komal, he will..." "The don is in India, not Malaysia." "And then, look at the girl. She is so beautiful." You won't get such a girl again. What are you discussing? Dowry? "No! Your sister is so beautiful, we should be giving the dowry." Let's invite a few selected guests and get them engaged. What happened? Papa said the don won't come to Malaysia. A don can come anywhere. It is possible he is in Malaysia right now. You! How did you come here? Bhai is waiting downstairs. Wear this gown and come down. - I'm coming. - Wear it and come quick! - Quick! - Yes. You've made my life miserable. Atleast let me live here in peace. "Doctor, you are only worried about yourself, not me?" - Tell him! - Bhai cannot sleep. - And you are sleeping peacefully? - Bhai is craving for that girl... ...like a fish for water. "How do I explain to you? If I don't get that girl, I'll die." "Doctor, when I don't find you, I become restless." "But after meeting you, my heart feels at rest." Your life is what it is. But why are you ruining my life? - Atleast let me live in peace. - What kind of a doctor are you? Does a doctor speak like that to his patient? It is the duty of a doctor to take care of his patient. "From now on, you have no other patient except Munnabhai!" "The money you make in a month, I'll pay you in a day." - Give him Rs.500000 for today. - He'll get it. What are you saying? But it is good you came here. There are very good doctors here. You will get good treatment here. "No doctor, I want only you." "The same girl, the doctor, I don't want anybody else." Assume I cannot cure you. What will you do then? I will not treat you. You cannot get the girl... ...and come to trouble me every time. "Doctor, I love this girl, or I would have picked her up long ago." What do you know about my life? "Since childhood, I have been scolded, abused, beaten." "When I grew up, I started killing people." Since that girl has come into my life... ...she has changed my life completely. She taught me what love is. "If I don't get that girl, I will die!" - Please save me. - I am with you. "If he dies, even I will die." What happened? Has he come? "- No, he hasn't come, but Komal is gone. - Where?" I don't know. She's not in her room. Where could she go in the middle of the night? "That's what! When I left the room, she was sleeping." "When I came back, she was missing." Where had you gone in the middle of the night? - I... - Now I understand! "No, it's not what you think." - Then did he take her away? - Who? - The phone guy. - Don't say that please! Let's find her. She's fallen asleep with great difficulty. She'd got scared finding herself alone. She was crying and shivering in fear. Let her sleep here now. - Take care of her. - That's why I am here. "I mean, I am as worried about her as you are." She changed sides. Love has awakened The world is sleeping Hey! What's happening "Nothing, it's only love that's happening" "Sleep and peace of mind is being lost" Love is happening "Hey, what's happening? What's going on" Love's happening?! The hearts are on fire The world is sleeping Let the world sleep Hey! What's happening "Nothing, it's only love..." "In love, you walk like a drunken man" "What if anyone watches us in this state" I am watching What's happening "Nothing, it's only love..." "The secret between us may be revealed" "Someone may carry tales to my brother" Your brother has noticed! What's happening "Nothing, it's only love..." What's happening? "- Yes, Pillai? - Where are you?" I have reached Malaysia. I'll go to the hotel where Munna is staying. - But... - Don't worry. Munna will be a dead man by tomorrow. Bye! "Doctor, cancel your sister's engagement." - You! - You'd gone to see a boy for her? You'd gone to fix her marriage? You'll get her engaged? How did you come to know? Who tells you all this? "What happened, brother? It's his call again?" Yes. I'll make Raja speak to him. "I'll go and call him, brother." "There is no time, I'll take the phone to Raja's room." Brother! Listen! This engagement will take place! You cannot do anything. I can do a lot. I will marry your sister... ...and you will be left standing and staring. What happened? Cat got your tongue? I didn't know you would turn out to be such a big rascal. Bad! It's bad to abuse your future brother-in-law. It is you who will see bad times now! Why do I have the feeling that you are standing behind me? I am standing behind you! "- Doctor, you! - Yes, me." You rascal! I suddenly thought of asking you to speak to him... ...that's how I caught you. Or I'd never know I'm having my enemy in my own home. "Raja, don't you feel ashamed to play such a dirty joke on brother?" "Come on, apologise to him!" "Even if he chops his head, I'll never forgive him!" "- Doctor, please forgive me. - Forgive? I'll have you thrown out!" "Get out of here! I will neither pay your room bill, nor your return fare." "Don't ever show me your face again, nor be around the engagement hall." Get out! What kind of people have you made friends with! "You are aware DD, that when my parents died..." "...she was so small, so soft. I even named her Komal (soft)." I have brought her up in total comfort. I never... "What do you think? I'll make her do the house chores, demand a dowry?" I will burn her alive? "You have only reared her, I will keep her as my daughter." But where is she? "Landed us in trouble, didn't you?" I've been telling you to tell brother everything. "Don't worry, nothing is lost yet. Everything will be alright." "How? The guests have arrived, and I'll soon be engaged." "You will be engaged, you are not engaged yet." I will wear the engagement ring for you. "Komal, we have been looking for you. Come soon, everyone wants to see you." - Especially me. - Come. "Bhai, what happened?" It's the same tension he has in India when he sees that girl. You saw her again? Downstairs? "- Bhai is feeling sick again. - Don't worry, I'll call the doctor." "Bhai, sit here." Don't keep your hand here... not here either. I'm pleased to meet you. One feels nice meeting his countrymen on foreign land. Excuse me... come here. "Have this glucose water, you will feel better." "Glucose won't give me relief, the doctor will." "Munnu hasn't come, you go and bring him." - Alright. - What are you doing? Your tension has passed on to me. So I have to drink glucose. I'm closing the door behind me so that no one disturbs you. Remove your hand from your face. "- You're here, your brother will come. - Bhai is calling you." Will you take a hard or soft drink? - I don't want anything. - Have a soft drink atleast. Waiter! Give him a soft drink. Did I ask for it? Get lost! He's avoiding me. What drinks do you have? "No, I won't let you go until the engagement is through." It's just about to begin. The engagement ritual is about to begin. Rascal! "Everybody come. Komal, come." "Bablu, she's Komal. Komal, he's Bablu." "Sister-in-law, give the rings." "- This is your ring. - No, this is Bablu's ring." "Oh! Sorry. This is your ring, Komal." "You wear the ring for Bablu first. Then Bablu, you wear it for her." "Give me your hand. Come on, Komal. Don't feel shy, Bablu." He fell from Bhai's room. There is some problem! He... I understand! Won't you stop your act even here? You are always doing wrong wherever you go. "There is bloodshed, dead bodies falling. You..." "Look, if Bhai had not killed him, he would have killed Bhai." That would have been better. Atleast I would be rid of him. What did you say? You would like it if I had died? - You would feel happy? - Yes... yes... yes! You have made my life miserable! "Since I have met you, you are after me like the plague!" I have lost my peace of mind. You are worried about your peace? You don't care about me? Why should I care for you? How are you related to me? What relationship do we share? "You may be the top don, but you are not my brother." "You are very angry. Drink glucose, you'll calm down." "Agreed Bhai is not your brother, but he is your patient." Now I feel calmer. "Look Munnabhai, a doctor patient relationship is limited to the clinic." I have no cure to your ailment. "Doctor, I don't know why I feel only you have a cure to my ailment." What do I tell you? I am very tensed. I see her everywhere. I saw her when I was standing in the balcony. "While sleeping, when awake, I see her all the time." I feel she is coming! Look! "Brother, what are you doing here?" What are you doing here? You go! "- Brother? - Yes, she's... You go!" What are you doing here? - How do you know him? - I have met him before. - Why did you meet him? - He had come to my dance class. - You go! - But what is he doing with you? "Come soon, everyone is waiting for you." I'm coming. "- She is your sister? - Yes, my younger sister." Shake hands with me too. "Doctor, she is the girl who has made me go crazy." Congratulations! Didn't I tell you only you had a cure to my ailment? "I am your brother-in-law, you are my brother-in-law." Doctor! What happened to him? I think the joy of seeing his sister's groom made him swoon. "Doctor, it's interval." "Bablu, all the guests have left. What are you doing here alone?" I was waiting for you. Let everyone go. We will complete the engagement ritual. - Let's exchange rings. - You will get engaged to her? There is one dead body on engagement day. There'll be 10 on the marriage day. - And the first one will be yours. - Mine? "Now think, do you want to get engaged, or live?" - I want to live ofcourse! - Let's exchange rings. "If I am not alive, what will I do with the ring?" "I'd told you, I'll wear the ring for you." Give me your hand. - Doctor. - You! You have come here again? "Please forgive me, doctor." "I am already tensed, don't give me any more tension." "Doctor, I love Komal very much." Forget her. Just forget her! It is impossible for us to forget each other. Each other? What do you mean? Even Komal... "If you don't believe me, ask Komal." "-Komal... - Yes brother, but it's all his fault." I never hide anything from you. "I always told him that we must tell you, but he said he wasn't in a hurry." That he's only working. "When he starts his own business, makes something of himself..." ...then we'll tell you. - Do you love my sister very much? - Yes. "Komal, you stay here. You come with me." "- How much do you love her? - Very much, sir." The problem is there is one more guy who loves my sister very much. Not as much as I love her. I came here for her sake. Even he has come here for her sake. - Where is he? - In this very hotel. - Who is he? - He's a very famous don of Mumbai. - Don? What's his name? - Munnabhai. Must have heard of him. "- Munnabhai? - Shocked, aren't you?" "No, infact, you made my task easier." "If it was someone else, it would be difficult getting him out of the way." But to get Munnabhai out of the way is easy. - Easy? - Yes. What's his room number? - 501. - I'll be back. Gone! We cleaned up the room. No one will know that you killed someone here. Someone knocking on the door? Could it be the police? "We didn't hear the siren, but yet, I'll go and check." "- Hello! - Raja, you!" "- Munnabhai, look who is here. - Raja! How did you land up here?" - Like you did. - Bhai came by flight. Even I didn't come by train. Good joke. Tell me. I want to discuss something important with you. "Yes, tell me." "Raja, I had promised I will give you whatever you want." - Tell him. - We'll even give you dollars. "Tell me, who do you want killed? Who do you want to collect money from?" "- Doctor's sister, Komal... - Your sister-in-law." Forget about her. - But why? - Because I love her. Move! He's got the attack again! Didn't you hear what he's saying? Explain to him! You have eyed Bhai's love. The consequences will be very bad for you! "Thank your stars you had saved his life, or he'd have killed you!" Those who love don't care for their lives. And Komal and I love each other. "Until I am around, nobody else can love Komal." It is the first time I have loved. "- Bhai, don't cry. - I am fine." "Raja, ask for my heart, I'll give it to you." But don't ask for Komal. "I am not asking her from you, I am just telling you." "Alright, I will crush my feelings, but you will have to ask her from me." "But I haven't come to ask, I have come to inform you." You will have to ask her from me. "She is my love, why should I ask her from you?" "If you don't ask for her, you won't get her." "Alright. If my love is true, I will get Komal." "If my decision is firm, I will get Komal." It's a bet! "Your kids will be beautiful. Komal is beautiful, and you..." "Bhai, don't turn away. Komal is coming!" This is your chance! Tell her! "How do I tell her? My lips get sealed, my brain stops functioning." - See this. - Let it pound. Gather courage! Take a deep breath. You! Sorry about the other day. But how come you are here? "- Bhai, speak! - Speak!" "Bhai is not feeling well, and your brother is here." So Bhai has come here for his treatment from your brother. You've come all the way to Malaysia to take treatment from brother? What is his ailment? What are you suffering from? - I... tell her. - Brother is in love. Love? So what's the problem? Doesn't the girl love you? - I don't know. - Does the girl know you love her? - No. - Have you told her? - No. - He is scared to tell her. Strange! There are people like you in today's world! "Don't worry, I will give you a cure to this." I am a doctor's sister after all. You are afraid to say 'I love you' to this girl? "My lips go dry, my hands and feet tremble." - Look. - See how they tremble. Assume that girl is me. Hold my hand. Hold her hand! Now say 'I love you' ...meet my eyes and say it. Say 'I... She is herself making him say 'I love you'. Stop her! "- Komal, wait. - Brother, I am curing him." Am I the doctor or you? Go from here! The doctor messed it all. What a scene it was! "She was making him say it, Bhai was saying it." "I thought they will unite, get married, and go for a honeymoon." Where did she go? - She left? - Yes. What were you doing? Do you know who he is? - He is your patient. - He is not my patient. He has turned me into a patient. The hand which you were holding and saying 'I love you'... ...do you know how many lives those hands have taken? - What do you mean? - I'll tell you. "Do you know, he's the top don of Mumbai, Munnabhai." Where are you going? - I slapped him. - That slap hit his heart. Careful! "The girl he loves, the girl he cannot confess his love to..." ...you are that girl. She's swooned again! "- Bhai, don't feel depressed. - Be happy." I am so tensed and you are joking? "Don't be angry, I'll give you good news." "- What? Raja is dead? - Not yet, but he'll die tonight." "Bhai, there are goons like us all over the world." - We found some local goons. - And gave them ?5000 to kill Raja. "They'll go to Raja's room at night, make him unconscious & take him away." "Kill him, and throw him in the river." Have you given them his room number? "- Yes, we remember it by rote. What is the number? - 501." You morons! That's my room number. We meant 510. Atleast be happy now. Drink your cocktail. - Don't throw that away. - You'll eat it? "Yes, I love it." They picked up Munnabhai thinking him to be you? Poor guys had come to take me. They took Munna instead. "- May his soul rest in peace! - You're great, Raja!" "Look, Munnabhai's stooges!" "Doctor, have you seen Munnabhai?" Me? No. I saw him yesterday. He is missing since last night. Wonder where he has gone. "Who can stop the one who wants to leave. Right, doctor?" "Raja, come here, we want to talk to you." - Tell me here. - We want to talk in private. - I won't come. - He's scared. "I was not afraid of your Munna, why will I be afraid of you?" - Then come! - Come. - What is it? - Where is Munnabhai? "The way you are asking me, as if he has told me and gone." - You know here Munnabhai is. - Don's have several enemies. Someone must have come from India and killed him. Hey! "Bhai, you! You are alive!" "I am alive, but you will die now." "If you care for your life, forget Komal and go back to India." "Or you will kill me? Bhai, this is not India, it is Malaysia." "If you shoot, even you will be hanged." "I will not shoot, he will." I will kill you and be hanged. Then Bhai will have no hurdles in his path. No I feel I am standing before a don. - What do I have to do? - You will go to Mumbai. I won't even take my luggage. And my passport is in my pocket. - Don't act smart. - Go to Mumbai. "If you are seen in Mumbai, I'll break your bones and kill you!" "You were going to kill me in Mumbai, I put you in a soup right here." Don't beat him too much. ...they beat a lot. "Bhai, he put us in trouble. The police here will not spare us." "I am not worried about myself, but about my love." "Bhai, you will surely get your love." "Don't worry, we can even sacrifice our life for you." "Bhai, before you lose your love, you go to her." - What do you mean? - We will confess to your crime. - What are you saying! - We will say you are not with us. - No! - Don't act stubborn. "You have our promise, Bhai." "- Bhai, you go. - No. - Go!" "Bhai, give our regards to Komal from her brothers-in-law." "I am Juliet, you are my Romeo" I feel just as you do "What do you have to say about me" You are Juliet You are my Romeo I feel just as you do What do you have to say about me Look in the entire city "But you won't come across a lover like me" Ask what I want "Not what you want, but what I want matters" What do you have to say about him When will we two unite "O my hero, O my love" "I am the hero, he's the villain" "Whatever it may be, this love story is great!" What do you have to say about me You cannot do a thing right. You said you got him arrested for possessing weapons. But he is a free man. I don't understand whether God is with me or Munna. The way you are stammering as if you Munna was standing before you. "Turn around and see, he's behind..." You are very shameless. You escape from everywhere. "But this time, you won't survive." "You wield power only in India, and I will never return to India." Even I won't go. Doctors are making more money here. "I will open a clinic here. I have no one but a sister, and she is here!" "I love Raja. When Raja will not go to India, why will I?" I will start dance classes here. Even I have no family. I will marry Komal and settle here. Move back! - Beat me! - Look Munnabhai... Beat me! "Stop it Munnabhai, or even I will raise my hand." "Munnabhai, stop!" "- Doctor, move! - Listen to me!" "They are just play acting, they are not actually fighting." "- Doctor, did you understand? - No." He is saying fighting in public areas is not allowed. So give them your passports. We are being deported to Mumbai. What do you say? "Doctor, where are you going? Back to Mumbai?" But I heard you want to settle down here? You were going to start a clinic here. You were going to get married here. And you were going to start dance classes here. "Now come to Mumbai, I'll make you dance there." You took us seriously? We were just joking. - We were joking. - But I am not joking. I will meet you'll in Mumbai. "Shinde, Munna is visiting Dr. Rastogi quite often these days." He must be visiting him for treatment. The visits don't prove that they are doing something together. Correct! Visits don't prove anything. "But if they go to Malaysia together, stay there together..." "...and even come back together, it certainly proves..." ...that something fishy is going on between the doctor and Munna. "Sorry sir, we don't even have proof that they were together in Malaysia..." ...and even came back together. See this picture. Tell him everything. "- Let's go. - Mr. Ramgopal, please come." "Look, the clinic is closed for the day, come tomorrow morning." "- No, wait. Who is sick? - No one is sick." But we have a problem which only you can solve. "Yes, I'm telling him. You know we have given our flat on rent." The tenant is not vacating our flat. Our 8 million rupees is stuck. - Only you can do something now. - How can I help you? By telling your brother-in-law. Brother-in-law? I don't understand. - Your Komal is marrying Munnabhai. - Congratulations! Congratulations! "If you dare to speak ill about my sister, I'll..." - What are you doing! - Mind him! He is talking nonsense about my sister. "I am not saying anything, the people are." Munnabhai's men have warned the people of the colony... ...that Komal is going to marry Munnabhai. And if anyone dares to look at Komal... ...they will kill him. Brother... Where is Munnabhai? Where is Munnabhai!! Let him come. We have tolerated enough. We won't tolerate anymore. Because it is now a matter of my sister's honour. I will not tolerate a slur on my sister's name ever! You cannot tolerate? It is me who is tolerating. The girl I love is right before me and I cannot marry her? I can easily have her picked. It is a very easy job for me. And no one has the power to stop me. But why am I not doing all this? Because I respect you. "I love your sister. Hey, tell him!" Love? Those who kill others can never love anyone. "I treated you as a patient. But you are a cheat, a goon..." "But you are a cheat, a goon, and will always remain one." You'll never change. "When I came to you for treatment, you said that girl is my cure." "Juts because she turned out to be your sister, you change your stance?" "If that girl was someone else's sister, would you have stopped me?" "- You wouldn't. - No, why would I?" "No, I mean, no decent man will get his sister married to a goon like you." "Hey Rastogi, enough of your nonsense! Bhai, warn him!" "You come to my house, abuse me, threaten me, call me a goon..." ...and are still alive. There cannot be a greater proof of decency than this. Hear one more thing. What is the day today? Sunday. I will marry your sister next Sunday. Go and make the marriage arrangements. Go! "Next Sunday, doctor!" Why have I been called here? I'd heard from many people that you are a very good doctor. "I am not keeping well since a few days, so I thought of consulting you." "Like this? Goons call people in this fashion, not the police." Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll be back in some time. Read this magazine until then. They call me to the police station. As if I don't know anything. Anything. Looks like he is very close to your heart. What is your relationship with Munnabhai? Don't think the police is unaware of your moves. We have every information about you. Munna visits you often. He went to Malaysia with you. "He even returned with you. And yesterday, you went to meet him." I want to hear all this from you. Now that you know everything... ...I will not hide anything from you. "Actually, Munnabhai has fallen in love with my sister." I am speaking the truth. "The whole neigbourhood is aware, you can check with them." You don't know how worried I am these days. I'd gone to tell him to forget about my sister. - Why? - What do you mean why? He threatened he is marrying my sister next Sunday. "So go ahead. He is handsome, and rich." Get your sister married to him. What nonsense are you talking! How can I get my sister married to a goon like Munna? Since the day that goon has fallen in love with your sister... "...to this day, no crime has been committed in the city." "He has neither killed anyone, nor extorted money from anyone..." ...nor has he forcibly taken over anyone's property. What are you trying to say? That to stop all this... ...I sacrifice my sister? "For the peace of the country, mothers have sacrificed their sons..." "...sisters have sacrificed their brothers, and wives their husbands." You cannot sacrifice your sister? Wait! You people cannot do anything... ...and are suggesting I sacrifice my sister's life? "The police is supposed to help the people, you are asking my help?" "Alright, we are ready to help you, but on one condition." You will have to help us collect evidence against Munna. What?? "- Tell me, doctor. - I want to meet you urgently." I am going to Holiday Inn for a meeting. Come and meet me there. Holiday Inn... AIright. Welcome. "Doctor, come. Sit down." "Munnabhai, I raised my hand on you that day, I'm sorry about that." It's okay. But just think. I am a decent man who is respected in society. How can I get my sister married to you? You are a decent man. You are respected in society. "- How am I to be blamed for that? - No, you cannot be blamed." What businesses are you into? "Doctor, you know everything, yet you are asking me?" It surprises me sometimes of how you can do so much. Then listen. You are a doctor. Your job is to give injections. To open up bodies... "...and remove hearts, kidneys from it." "- Isn't that a brave job? - Yes, it is." One needs a brave heart to do such brave jobs. "For some time, assume you are not Munnabhai." - Why should I? - Yes why should you? "Alright, if you were in my place..." ...would you get your sister married to me? - 100 ?/?. - You would? - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. "Hey doctor, no one can go to the bathroom..." ...in-between a meeting with Bhai. "- Pappu, he is my elder brother. - Sorry Bhai... Come." Go. "That I'll know after the meeting, whether I should kill, or shake hands." Sit down. "Whether I'll take you back or not, I'll think of that later." But what did you do for so many days when you were on your own? What if you don't join hands with us after we tell you? "Munnabhai, he is my younger brother. He doesn't how to speak, excuse him." I'll tell you. We... Speak! He is my elder brother. Speak! Didn't you hear? He is my younger brother. Speak! "Bhai, he is speaking our language!" Speak! "Munnabhai, your elder brother is a police spy." "- Bhai, I'll kill him! - Shut-up! He didn't beat you." Sit down! The cashew nuts became wet. How will we eat them now? You dare to catch my shirt collar! Didn't you hear what Munnabhai said? The top don of Mumbai calls me his brother. How can you touch me! "Munnabhai, keep him in check, or things will get out of hand." "Munnabhai, we have come here for a compromise, not to get beaten." No compromise! Get lost! - Go! - Get lost! "Enough, Munnabhai! You are finished now!" "You won't rule Mumbai now, Pillai will!" He is Munnabhai's elder brother. What brother? Munnabhai is no more the top don. "You were acting very smart, weren't you?" You slapped Pillai's brother? "Munnabhai cannot help you now, so what will you do?" "Bhai, the doctor is fighting!" Even I am surprised. But his sister is my girl. Will it prove our nemesis? ...it's just a thought. I'm finished! My stomach... "Pillai, I have told you several times." "If you want to shoot, just shoot, don't talk." - What are you doing! - We are sorry! Pillai's rule ends even before it began. "Pillai, you should think before doing anything." Why did you raise your hand on Bhai? - We made a mistake. Tell him! - Even you made a mistake. "You wanted to kill Bhai? Bhai, kill him!" "Bhai, don't get excited. We will leave the city." "Bhai, what are you waiting for? Just shoot his brains off." "Forget it, let him go. Hey you, leave!" "Next time you are seen here, forget Munna, I won't spare you!" Get lost! - He's a great doctor! - He's so talented. - The way he bashed them. - You're very intelligent. - I called him a coward... - You were perfect! "Bhai, give him a present." This is a gift from me. This lion heart is incomparable! My friend is incomparable! "You are tall, a brave heart" You are a man far-sighted The whole city calls me a hero "But when you come before me, Munnabhai" I shiver in fear When you threaten me I collapse! I'll open a bottle What do you say? It is me who's had drinks Why are you drunk? "Everyone is afraid of me, I am afraid of you" "I love you, you are very dear to me" "When I get charged, is when I'm in my senses" "But when you come before me, Munnabhai..." I made you a lover You came to my house to love Our friendship is doubled "Our problems have been solved, we settled them amicably" "Don't leak our secret talk to anyone" "If I get a wife, my life will be made!" "But when you come before me, Munnabhai..." - Sister-in-law! - Sister-in-law? Bhai suddenly took the decision of getting married last night. I had to get invitation cards over night. I came to give the first invitation card to you. And the rest are for your friends and relatives. "Bhai has said if you need anything, let him know." The wedding dress is ready. "I am going. It's Bhai's first marriage, there's a lot to do." - Brother! - Coming! - What happened? - See these wedding cards. So what's so worrying? They are just wedding cards. - They are my wedding cards! - What! Munna has got them printed. He's fixed our marriage for this Sunday. "What will we do now, brother? I am really scared." There is no need to be afraid. Let me see how he marries you! You've been able to do nothing until now & he even got the cards printed. - He'll even take Komal away. - But what do I do? - He wants to marry Komal. - Yes. "If Komal is married off to another guy, will he marry a married Komal?" But where will I find a good boy for Komal in such a short time? "- He's standing before you. - Brother, don't think, give consent." "And anyway, I won't marry anyone except Raja." Greetings. What do you want? "Priest, I want to get them married." - It cannot be done. - Why? You have to first fix up an auspicious time for the marriage rites. We don't have time for all that. Just get them married immediately. But his time is running bad. Saturn is casting a shadow on his fate. Death is hovering over him. - What nonsense are you talking! - I am speaking the truth. This girl's face says some very brave man loves her. She will marry that guy. "You were right, priest. This moment is inauspicious!" Run! They want to get married. But God doesn't want them to get married. "The boy loves the girl, the girl loves the boy..." ...then what can God have? "God doesn't have a problem doctor, I have a problem." "Hello, Magistrate. I want to get them married." "I am Dr. Rastogi, he is Raja, and she is my younger sister, Komal." "Here are the rings. You exchange the rings, and you make the documents." Why are you in such a hurry? You know very well that haste makes waste. - Where is the witness? - I am the witness. "As per law, we need two witnesses." Where is the other witness? You be the other witness. "I can be your witness. But then, I'll have to call another Registrar." For which you will have to wait until tomorrow. "No, how can we wait for a day?" "- You are upset? - Yes, I am upset." What am I here for? To serve you people. I'll arrange another witness for you. - Who will be the other witness? - Wait a minute. "Sir, please come in and help them by giving your witness." Oh my God! "I'd warned you not to come anywhere near Komal, or I'll kill you!" "- Leave! - What are you doing, Bhai!" I would have killed him! "Go and kill him outside my office, or I'll lose my job." Leave my hand! All of Mumbai and my neighbourhood is aware I am a respectable man. I am a doctor by profession practicing since many years. "I have a sister, Komal." "You all know Munnabhai, the dreaded underworld don..." ...who has made our lives miserable. "He is troubling us a lot, and we cannot do anything about it." - In what way is he troubling you? - Is he demanding extortion money? - Is he demanding some property? - No... - Then what does he want? - He loves my sister. "Yes, he loves my sister." "- Does your sister also love him? - No, she loves Raja." "- I am Raja. - Yes, he is Raja." Then why don't you take help from the police? On what basis do we take police help? It's not a crime to love. "We are decent people, we cannot fight a goon." So what do you want to do? "Through you, we want to tell something to the public and police." "Right now, I am the biggest hurdle in Munnabhai's path." He will surely try to kill me. So in whatever way I die... ...Munnabhai will be responsible for my death. Only Munnabhai. I will not spare him! I will kill him! "That is what he wants, that you flare up." "If anything happens to him, you'll be finished." "Bhai, we'll have to appoint bodyguards for his security." Let me explain. "If he dies even accidentally, you'll be in trouble." Why didn't you say that before? "Hey, you come to Munnabhai's area and address him as just Munna?" How dare you address him disrespectfully! You know by now how much daring I have from the papers. You get four lines published in the paper & think you can win against me? But I won't let you win either. No one can stop me from marrying Komal now. "Komal belongs to me, she will marry only me." - Don't even take Komal's name! - Hold it! "Take, the wedding card. The day is same, the bride is same." Only the groom has changed. "Now I am the groom, not you." Just getting a card printed doesn't mean the marriage will take place. "Now that the card is printed, even the marriage will take place." Do come. And bring along your stooges. I have to give many invitations. He's proved tough on us. He's taken the help of law. Even we will take the help of law. - Call up inspector Shinde. - What's his number? I remember now. Give it to him. "Shinde, Bhai wants to talk to you. Take, Bhai." Shinde... meet me in the evening. "Two commandos are enough for me, I don't need such heavy security." They is not security for you. We have your search warrant. Search the area. "Rane, call up the headquarters and tell them we are reaching soon." - What is this? - A revolver. I am arresting you for possessing a weapon without license. It's not mine. "I found it here, so it's yours." This... I understand. This is Munna's conspiracy. I only had told him I'll land in trouble if it's found on me. - I am in trouble. Let's go. - Come. "Raja, don't worry, I have come. I'll get you released." "Inspector, why has Raja been arrested?" He possessed an illegal weapon. - What weapon? - An illegal weapon. Oh! "I am speaking the truth, doctor. I don't know anything about this gun." I am sure it's Munna's conspiracy. Just a minute! You mean to say the police is hand in glove with Munna? "Commissioner, Raja is innocent. You can check his past record." He has never done anything illegal. - We found a gun on him. - I am ready to pay bail. "The bail application has to be made in court, not the police station." Today is Sunday. Go to court and get him bailed out tomorrow. Leave... leave! We're leaving. "- Hello, Commissioner. - Why have you come here?" Bhai's wedding invitation. "Don't worry, you'll come to no harm." Bhai has made security arrangements for you. My security arrangements? Hey Raja! He's here! How are you? "He's with his in-laws, and Komal will be with her in-laws tomorrow." "Take your invitation. The day, date, time and place are the same." And even the groom is the same - Munnabhai! "You cannot come, so give your best wished to the couple from here itself." "We have to leave, we have a lot to do." "Commissioner, believe me, I am innocent." You take police protection saying your life is in danger... ...and then also keep illegal weapons? - That revolver belongs to Munna. - It was found at your workplace. "It's Munna's conspiracy. He cannot kill me, because he will get arrested." So he's got me framed. "Commissioner, I'm no criminal. I've just dared to stand up against him." He is making me pay for it. See this card. He is forcibly marrying Komal now. "Komal will die, but never marry him." "Please Commissioner, it's a question of Komal's life. Please release me." I promise I will collect evidence and get Munna arrested. You have spoken enough. Now I will speak. I could not nab Munna until now with the help of law. I don't know why I feel today that Munna can be nabbed by breaking law. No one will do anything. He's out of his head. No one will do anything. The way you are taking me... ...like you are the Commissioner and I am the culprit. "Commissioner, you have done me a favour." "But right now, don't disturb me, I am in a hurry." Before Munna reaches Komal. I have to reach her. Return my gun. "Drop me here, I don't want to attend the wedding." You want to get down? Get down! I wasn't in such a hurry that you had to throw me out. The guests behind me The band ahead of me The groom has come "Bride, open the door" Shed all your inhibitions "Don't say no, say yes to love" I will come dancing to your door And take you away "Come of your own will and enter my heart" The groom has come... "Come, my beloved" I swear My helplessness "May force me to marry against my wishes" "I took your name, I thought of you" Your memories stop me "Come now, my beloved, there is very little time" "Until I live, I swear, I'll live for you" "My eyes shed tears, my heart wallows in pain" Come! Come! "Where are you, O prince of my dreams" "Raja, come!" "Apply henna, get all decked up" Get dressed as a bride I have been after you since so long "Look, I am standing outside your home" "Either I come in, or you come out" The groom has come... "Doctor, Bhai is come dressed as a groom." But I see no marriage arrangements here. What's going on? Go back just as you have come. "If Bhai has come, he will take his bride with him." What did you say? That I should go back? "Yes, it is in your interest that you leave." And it is in your interest that you send the bride with me. It's a matter of my prestige. Prestigious people have a prestige. - Goons have no prestige. - What did you say? "I have no prestige? Wherever I pass from, people salute me." They don't salute you. It's just that they fear you. But I don't fear you. Get lost! You pushed Bhai! You pushed me too! Get out of here! What will you do? You will kill me? "Doctor, I consider you like my elder brother." I cannot have any relationship with a goon like you. Get out of here! "You will beat me? Come on, beat me!" "Doctor I respect you, or even I can raise my hand!" "Hey, get lost, fatso!" "- Enough, doctor! - What will you do? Beat me?" Let's see if the hands that commit crimes are stronger... ...or the hands that protect a sister's honour. Wait! No one will interfere. "Doctor, if you raise your hand now, I'll go on a shooting spree!" First try shooting me. Brother! Stop this nonsense! You have made our lives miserable. What do you know what love is? You only love my beauty. "I will die, but I will not belong to you!" "I belong to Raja, and will always belong to him." "Why bring them into this, Munna? This is a fight between you and me." "- One who survives, wins. - Then you will die!" "Munnabhai, no!" Get the car! "Come Raja, hurry!" "No patient will be admitted today, we are on strike." "I am a doctor, my name is Dr. Rastogi" "If you are a doctor, then support us." How can I support you? This girl has been shot. Then take her to the police station. I don't have time for that. "You continue with your strike, let me go in. I am a doctor..." "- You cannot go in. - Can't you see, she is..." Who has closed the hospital doors? Do you know who I am? "- Open the doors. - Doctor, come!" Get the stretcher. ...careful. "Be brave, Bhai." Careful. "You stay here. Doctor, come." "Munna, you didn't do right." "Yes, the bullet that should have hit you, not Komal." It really wasn't right. I have no one in the world except Komal. "If anything happens to her, I won't spare you." "If you have no one in the world, why are you alive?" Even you will have to die. "I will, but after killing you!" What are you doing! You are too much! You are a slur on humanity! "At this place, at such a moment... Shame on you!" "Munna, your bullet hit close to my heart." Do me a favour. Shoot right in my heart. Because only Raja resides in there. He will leave my heart only after I die. "Munnabhai, no... what..." "No doctor, I realise today, that a gun can kill..." ...but cannot help win a heart. "Komal, I truly love you." And always will. "Don't love me, but I have a request." Please don't hate me ever. I'd told you that only one man can give evidence against Munna. Munna himself. Let's go. "Yes doctor, when I am out of jail..." ...then perhaps someone will truly love me. "No doctor, you are good." "I said you are good, so you are good." "Commissioner, we cannot live without Bhai." - Take us along too. - What have you done? Whatever Bhai has done. - This weapon is illegal. - Even I have an illegal weapon. "Commissioner, we have a request. We will serve the same sentence as Bhai." We will stay in the same lock-up as Bhai. - We cannot live without Bhai. - What brotherhood! Wow! Come.
