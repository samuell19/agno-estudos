No, no, they landed, they look great. But you'll never guess what happened. Wait, you guys have only been dating for like six months. Yeah, well, when you know, you know. I followed your lead and put Ken on an email list for a few jewelers. Worked like a charm. Wow, well, congrats, I'm so happy for you two. Listen, you have been with Liam forever. I'm sure it's really a matter of time. Wait, your anniversaries this weekend, right? Yeah. Maybe we make you a nail appointment just in case. Okay, call the salon, just in case. In case. Hey babe. I'll be there in a minute. We're celebrating. I brought champagne. Grab the nice champagne glasses. Why aren't you dressed? What are you talking about? What do you think? Oh, I mean, yeah, I finally found the perfect house for that couple, but. Oh, sounds great. But is there anything else you wanna celebrate? Liam, do you realize what day it is? Friday. This is so typical of you, always forget our anniversary. Oh babe, is that today? I'm so sorry. Work's been crazy, but maybe we can go out for a special day tomorrow? Is our relationship that insignificant to you? What are you talking about? Our relationship is very important to me. Then why, after five years, did you forget our anniversary? Yes, if I was such a priority to you, then how could you forget? I'm sorry, I've just been focused on. Everything, but us. After all this time, I thought we would grow closer, but you still won't let me in. Wait. I've been getting all these ads for engagement rings lately. You didn't? I did. Why not? I'm just not ready for that. And you know how I feel about marriage? I know, but I've changed. And I thought you would too. You should know by now if I'm the one or not. Morgan, I love you, but. I love you too, but I can't stay in a relationship anymore where I feel like I'm just temporary housing until you find your perfect home. It's not fair to me. I get it. I should go. You need some time to yourself. 'Cause I'm concerned about you with this breakup. How can I enjoy Christmas, when I'm heartbroken? You don't need him or any man to make you happy. You are a strong, independent woman. You're right. But I don't love him because I need him. I need him because I love him. Makes sense? We dated for five years. I'm ready to move forward with a commitment. He should know by now, if I'm the one or not. And apparently I'm not. I feel like I'm just as stand in until his true love comes along. I get it. You just need to focus on what you used to love about the holidays. Hopefully it will help get your old self back. Christmas used to be so special to us. Oh, it's gonna be tough now that I'm all alone. I know, I'm sorry, I have to go to the in-laws. Maybe you're lucky you're not married. But we will all have our family together for Christmas, at my place. And there's nowhere else, I'd rather be in the world. Oh no. I thought you got rid of all of these. All of these pictures. I hate leaving you like this. Can't you go somewhere, like maybe a tropical island? Stop worrying about me, I want you to enjoy your trip, well, as much as you can. I'll be fine, I promise. No more Liam. And the pitch, there's the hit. Out to left field. This one is way out there and gone. Over the left field fence. Hey, I was watching that. This has to stop. The sofa has a permanent imprint in it 'cause you've been lying there so long. Your boss is wondering if you'll ever return to work. And trust me, if you lose your job, I ain't covering your rent. Yeah, well I'm not really in the mood for selling people their dream home. Look, it's Thursday night. You need to get off your butt and go out with me. Come on, this is pathetic. Tell me what you really think. You need to get back in a game. I mean, pretty girls, you and me, how it used to be, breaking hearts. We never did that. We talked about it a lot. Well, you won't know if you still got it, unless you try. Hey, can you pass me some more like candy please? You mean the ones Morgan left here. I need to get away. How do you get over your ex at Christmas? Christmas Lonely Hearts Club. "A singles only program to detox "from relationships over the holidays." "A safe place to regain your love of the season, "enjoying lots of Christmas activities "with a new set of welcoming friends." "Avoid the loneliness of the holidays "and bond with a group of people in the same situation." "Absolutely no relationships allowed." Perfect. Now that's more like it. You look a lot better. Check this out. Oh this is exactly what you need. Right. You'll come back refreshed, in a festive spirit and more importantly, single and ready to mingle. Come on, man, hit that button. Boom. Here, let me help. I am so sorry. I didn't know you were standing there. My apologies, I shouldn't have crept up on you like that. Okay. My goodness, are you staying for a month? I thought the B&B program ended on Christmas. I didn't know what to pack. Are you staying here as well? Indeed. Let me get this. Thank you. I'll get your bag, how's that? Very well. Thank you. Thank you. So, I'm Morgan. Harry. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Welcome. Come on in. - Hello. - Hey. - You must be Harry. - Yes. And you're Morgan, correct? We spoke on the phone. Oh so pleased you found us. You two better not be a couple. You know the rules. No, no, we just met outside. I'm only kidding, of course you aren't. It's a singles only program. Well I'm Juliet and I'll be taking care of you. Please make this your home. This is your safe space for the next week. Thank you, Juliet. These are for you. Morgan, you're in room three, which is just up the stairs to the right. And take this time to get settled in and make yourself comfortable. Then we'll be having some welcome drinks in the living room at four. Sounds good, thank you. Let me know if you need anything. - I will. - Thank you. Do you need any help? Oh no, I can take it from here. Thank you. Okay, Harry at six, which is also up upstairs to the right. Just go past three, four. Five, six. Goodness, we're thinking the same thing. Oh no. Oh, stupid thing. Do you need some help? - Oh. - Sorry. So sorry, I didn't hear you come up the stairs. My key is just not working, I think. I think you might have the wrong room, Juliet said I was in number three. I am so sorry, you're so right. Force of habit. Oh totally fine. I've been coming here for four years and Juliet has always put me in room number three. Oh, well I'm happy to switch if you'd like. No, no it'll be nice to try something different. Okay. Nola. Morgan, nice to meet you. Yeah, I will see you later at the welcome meeting. I will see you later. Cool. Well, if I can't fall back in love with Christmas here, then I never will. Come in. Nola, I heard you had got here a little early. I wanted to make sure that you. You're not Nola. I'm sorry. It's okay. It seems I've still in our spot. Nola's in room four, if you wanna say hello. I'll see her at the reception later on. I'm David. Morgan. Pleasure to meet you, Morgan. So you've been here before, too? This will be my fifth year. It's a great place to come to get away from all the chaos and meet new people who feel like family. That's exactly what I'm looking for. Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Morgan. Likewise. See you later. Have a good one. Room four, right. Room four. I am so pleased that you chose my program as your sanctuary this Christmas. Christmas time, it's not always joyous for everyone. One can feel lonely or even jealous, seeing others in relationships. Here, you'll make new friends and escape the pressures of forced relationships. And learn that this season is and always should be the happiest time of the year. And you don't need a partner to make you happy. When I moved here from London, I was completely alone, but I made my family here with all my wonderful guests. In order to maintain the integrity of the program, my only rule is no dating. You will learn that you have to love yourself before you can receive true love from someone else. You'll also learn to find the joy of Christmas within here. We are all in this together. We are all in the same boat. Or the same Christmas sleigh, one might say. So we have a full list of activities planned. I'll pass out the activities later. I'm sorry, I'm late. Is this the Christmas rehab thing? Yes. It's the Lonely Hearts Christmas Club. Right. Come on in, we're just getting started. Liam, right? - Yes, yes. - Yes, yes. Take a seat. You know, I just realized that my mom has decided to come home for the holidays. So I think I should go. Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's nothing to be afraid of, okay. We are all friends here. Morgan, why don't you make Liam feel at home? Everybody say hello to Liam. Liam. I've been coming for four years and Juliet has always. Christmas sleigh, one might say. I'll be back. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Why aren't you with Emma? She's with the in-laws. And I thought I'd take a little vacation. What about work? Aren't you crazy busy right now? Oh no, I finished up all my deadlines early. I was super productive this year. And I thought this place sounded fun. I wanted to come check it out. Not because the heartbreak thing, I didn't even know that that's what goes on here. At the Christmas Lonely Hearts Club, really? Well, what are you doing here? Well, just a stupid mix up, really. Andy booked it for himself and then he suddenly had to go out of town. Booking was non-refundable, so I thought, why not? Andy booked this? Yeah. Your roommate, Andy? The same guy who goes up to Christmas parties every night with bundle of mistletoe, to hit on as many girls as possible, that Andy? He's trying to change his ways. But decided he's not ready to do so, clearly. Here we go. Your itineraries for the week. Thank you. Day by day, hour by hour. No shortage of Christmas fun here. Oh it is a busy day tomorrow, so you might want to get to bed early. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. So I should probably leave since I'm assuming I'm the last person you wanna be around during the holiday. No, not a problem for me. I'm fine. But I understand if you feel uncomfortable and you need to leave. No problem here. And besides booking's non-refundable. Right. So I'll see you tomorrow. Right, goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Oh Nola, did you enjoy the introduction? I know it by heart. Right. Why have you been here so often? Well, when my husband died, five years ago, holidays were really painful and I was really lonely and depressed. So I found this place and it saved me. It's the best place to be during the holidays. I am so sorry to hear about your husband. No, it's fine. It's a lot better now. This place has been really good for me, so. I feel really happy when I'm here. I honestly never thought I'd feel that way again. Well, goodnight. Goodnight. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ One of the most wonderful things about the holidays, is the decorating of one's tree. Don't settle for a small tree or even no tree, just because you're decorating for one. Let the tree be an expression for oneself. Do you deserve a big, be beautifully decorated Christmas tree? - Yes. - Yes, of course. You deserve the best. And it will give you joy every time you look at it. Lionel, let me show you. It looks like we are stuck together. Oh, oh no. I'm not sure there's more lights needed here. I didn't even decorate this year. Ah, I know what you mean. I didn't bother putting up any decorations either. If I wasn't for this retreat, I would've missed the season altogether. Well, I want to learn more about the magic of Christmas to tap into the lucrative market for my confectionary company. You work in candy? How sweet. It's the first time I've heard that line. Yes, I'm the exec at Chisel Chocolates. It's a family business, but I've been letting the name down lately. We're not hitting our Christmas targets. I'm single and a workaholic. So I'm here to get some Christmas spirit. If I can understand the magic of Christmas, then I can help with the marketing and sales of our candy. There we go. Well, that is very practical of you. Guilty. I hope this place teaches you more about the magic of Christmas than just how to make a profit. I'm already feeling a lot more in love with the season. So Liam, what's a handsome guy like you doing in a place like this. Shouldn't you be at a Christmas party meeting beautiful women? I'm not sure I'm ready to jump back into the dating scene just yet. Oh, just got out of a serious relationship, huh? Fortunately I never had that problem. Never got anything long term, you know. Never been married, huh? Nah. Seemed like too much trouble to me. Besides I like doing my own thing and it doesn't involve walking around all day carrying bags, you know. So what's your story? I've always loved Christmas so much. And I get to live it nearly every day through my work creating holiday ads. But I just seem to have lost my mojo, my Christmas spirit. And I need to get it back if I wanna save my job. How ruthlessly practical of you. Guess we have something in common. Yeah, maybe we can help each other. All right, I'm gonna try the other lights then. Good, I will do that. Bet you're not forced to watch any silly Christmas romance movies either. Or explain why 18 holes of golf every day never gets old. Life of a bachelor sounds pretty good. Yeah. I guess. Why would anyone want to get married? Oh no. Here, let me help. Thank you so much. So Harry, where'd you say you come from again. So yeah. Decorating cookies is my favorite activity at the resort. Never have time to be creative, so. Yeah, it's very relaxing. Yeah, you didn't seem very relaxed yesterday. What's going on with you and Liam? Liam? I don't know what you mean. I was just getting to know him. Yeah. What? You just seem familiar. He's really attractive. Oh, you want me to put in a good word, he seems like if be open to dating. No, thank you. That's against the rules, first of all. And I just, I really want you to enjoy yourself while you're here. So if you want to talk or need to talk, you know where to find me. There's honestly nothing to talk about. I'm staying well away from Liam. He seems like a guy who doesn't believe in commitment. Just met, huh? Well, whatever is going on, I hope you can just forget it and relax. Yeah. I'm hoping the change of scenery does me good. Are you sure there's nothing wrong? Yeah, I just lost my Christmas spirit. It's been a rough couple of weeks. Well, good news is you came to the right place. And I think it's gonna take just a little bit longer for you to get your Christmas talents back. Oh, rude. Is it that bad? It's a mess. - It is that bad. - It's a rough one. Oh. What happened to you, Morgan? Getting in trouble again? Oh, hey, I'm such a klutz. I don't think you should be carrying anything. Well, I'll make sure to call you over next time and go to pick up anything so you can come rushing to the rescue. Did you make this? Yes. I think I subconsciously dropped it because it looks so awful. I'm certain Juliet will not be impressed. Well, that's my piece de resistance that Juliet had David and I working on. Ah, French, fancy. I think you said something about dogs. Almost. Well, they're very good. They look like snowflakes. I'll find a broom to clean this up proper. Thank you, as a reward, I'll get you some cocoa. Sounds good. Sorry, I didn't know you were in here. I can come back later. No, it's fine. I was just making some hot chocolate. I was about to do the same. - Listen about yesterday. - Look, I wanted to talk to but. Sorry, go ahead. No, it's okay, you go. Look, I know this is awkward. We'd said we'd have no contact and here we are unable to avoid each other. I think it's best if no one knows about us, about our past. We don't want to cause any tension in the group. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. Good. It doesn't help to move on, if everyone keeps asking us what happened. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. Cool. Cool. So truce, some hot chocolate as a peace offering. Oh actually I'm gonna need two cups please. Right. Here you go. Thanks, see you later. Yep, see you. Your cocoa, Sir. Whoa, who told you, you could carry hot drinks? Beep, beep coming through, stand back 50 feet. Thank you. Let's do a Christmas puzzle. - Sure. - Yeah. And. Oh no. For my next mess. Let me just get these for you. The stew was delicious. Yes, compliments to the chef. Thanks, it's just a family favorite. Quite easy to make. Now listen, you two, this retreat is all about getting out there, making new friends. So make sure you mingle with everyone and not just each other. Absolutely love. Morgan, I bet you didn't know, Liam is also from Cleveland. Perhaps you two have some mutual friends? I highly doubt it. I mean, Cleveland's such a big city. Plus I overheard him talking to David and he seems like the type that I typically try to avoid. You know, I like to surround myself with people who are punctual, not people who are chronically late and think the world revolves around them and they stop it and they're like, "Hey, I'm here. "Everyone come onto my clock and do what I have to do." And not people who forget important dates. Well just maybe just don't judge a book by its cover. You never know what people are going through. You're right, Juliet. I will keep an open mind. Would you like to join me outside for some hot chocolate? I'll have to take a rain check. I should settle into my room. Gotta get ready for the next activity Juliet throws our way. Of course. So we'll see each other again. I think it's safe to say we're gonna see each other very soon. Have a good night. I don't believe it out of all the places. Do you think he's stalking you? No, what? No, of course not. It's just life's odd sense of humor. I did everything I could to try to escape him and look where we ended up, in the middle of nowhere in this romantic B&B under the same roof. Romantic B&B? I'm worried about you Morg. Well, you shouldn't be, there's actually this charming guy here, Harry, he's British. Does he look like prince Harry? Yeah, he kinda does. He's cute. Must be awful. He's nice to talk to, but I'm definitely not looking for a new relationship. Plus I can't even think about it because if I did Juliette would kick me out. Yeah, she sounds scary. She's passionate. She just doesn't want this place disturbed by any relationship drama. Well, hello, what could be more disruptive than being stuck in a B&B with your ex, the love of your life. Emma. Sorry. At least you thought he was. Slip of the tongue. I just think you should think about leaving. I can always come back early and tell everyone there was an emergency. No, don't do that. And it's only five more days I can handle it. Plus it's kind of therapeutic. Sounds like messed up therapy. You should see an actual therapist. Someone who make you feel better, not worse. Emma, I'm finding closure. I heard Liam tell someone that he never wants to get married. It's all so obvious now. He doesn't even seem remotely upset that we broke up. I needed to see that. It's over for good. Now I can just focus on moving on and hopefully find my excitement over Christmas again. Okay, just please be careful. I love you. Sorry, I gotta go. I love you too. Come in. Bonsoir. I'm sorry to bother you, but I wanted to give you this. Okay. All the guests are going to write a private letter to Santa, expressing their hopes for the holidays and wishes for the new year. It's an exercise to help liberate you and reconnect with the soul of Christmas. So just write whatever's on your mind. And then when you're done, pop it in the letter box for Santa, in the hallway. Thanks. Tomorrow evening, we are having a wonderful group dinner. I have paired each of you up to prepare part of the meal. I've got you down, working with Nola on the roast. Is that okay? That sounds great. Wonderful. Well, that's it. Ah, sleep well Morgan. Night. Oh, good morning, David. Did you sleep well? Like a log. Oh are you a yule log. Oh, I see a letter for Santa, please. So Juliet, I wanted to talk to you about today's activities. Yes. I see you paired me with Harry for the gingerbread cookies. Is there a problem? Yes, I am allergic to gingerbread. Allergic, since when? You definitely didn't put that on your dietary requirements form. It developed later in life. I get such an awful rash from a cookie. Oh no, we can't have that. We'll have to scrap the gingerbread altogether. No, no, you can serve the gingerbread to everyone else. I don't want anyone to miss out. I just can't touch 'em. I guess I'll just have to sit this one out. But I would like to contribute, maybe I can help Nola and Morgan with the roast. You know, Nola and I did it last year. It was delicious. I'll tell you what. I'll see if Morgan is happy to switch. Oh, okay, and then she can partner with Harry, great. Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that is a terrible idea. I can see potential chemistry a brewing. I'll switch things around, put Morgan with Liam, there is definitely no chance many romance happening there. - Right, right. - Right. The boss. Right. Right. Right. Come in. It's only me. What do you want? I've been ordered to work with you on baking the gingerbread cookies. Oh, okay. Yeah, there's been a slight reshuffling of teams. So just checking to see if you're up for it. Do you wanna take it in turns or? Liam, I've seen you in the kitchen. I'm not risking you ruining the cookies. Good point. But yeah, I just don't wanna make it difficult for you. No, don't worry about me, I'm fine. But if you'd rather just sit this one out, I can make the cookies. No, I'm totally good. And besides I should help. Okay. Okay. All right. It says two cups of flour. Okay, pour me the first cup and I'll slowly mix it in. Okay. So how's it going? You mean here? Good. My room's very comfortable. I meant in general, since we? Since we broke up? It's okay, you can say it. I've been fine. Busy, busy with work and stuff. Good. Glad to hear it. You? Yeah, same, same, good, busy, busy watching a whole lot of TV. Only TV? I think I've watched every movie ever made. That's impressive. Particularly fitting in with work. Truthfully, I've bombed a bunch of pitches. My job's hanging on by a thread. That's not like you. I know. I've turned into a Baja Bug. It's like my Christmas spirit has gone on holiday or something. I'm sorry, you'll get it back. It's a tough time of year to pretend to be on top of the world when you aren't. Yeah. That's exactly how I feel. I just can't fake it. Not that I'm struggling personally or anything, just burnt out. Of course. That's what I meant. Okay. I will grab a measuring spoon for the ginger. You put out some flour so we can roll the dough. Sound like a plan? Sounds good to me. I am so sorry. You're a walking disaster area in the kitchen. You know that right? Maybe. Okay, just step away from the flour. Yep, stepping away. Oh my gosh. Oh, you missed the spot. Thanks. And you missed some here too. There. How are you two getting along? - Great. - Great, yeah. I feel like the table is still missing something. You know what? You're right. I know. Poinsettias. You do have good taste. I could say the same thing about you. It's an easy guess, it's your favorite flower. How do you know that? You may have let it slip once or twice, a couple years back while we were rapping gifts. I can't believe you remember that. Should we place out some name cards, maybe? Great idea, I was thinking Juliet at the head. Oh yeah, I agree. And I think we should place Morgan to her right and Liam to her left. Those two need to be opposite each other. If I didn't know you better, I'd say you were up to something. - What, me? - Yes. Never, no, maybe. Anyway, we need to place Lionel at the far end of the table so that he can check the score. He can check the score, yeah. It is the hockey quarter finals. There's no way he's getting through dinner without checking the score. Not a chance, no. It's not happening. Well ladies and gentlemen, I think we must say a big thank you to all our wonderful chefs who have outdone themselves. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Okay, dessert is up next. But before that I want to open up the floor so that each of you can share with the group, your favorite Christmas memory. It could be something from your childhood or maybe even something from this trip. One of the things I love most about Christmas is all the nostalgia. So who would like to go first? Morgan, how about you? It's hard to say. It can be something small. Well. When I was young, we didn't have much, even though my parents were always working. One year, my sister and I took up a ton of odd jobs to save up enough money to buy my parents this painting of our family. When they opened it, they were so surprised and so happy. The look on their faces was priceless. And they always said that it felt like a Christmas miracle to watch our excitement, as we opened our presents from Santa. But I think that was the first time that I really felt the joy of giving. And, it's a moment that I'll remember forever. Oh, that's really lovely. Thank you. Yes, there's nothing quite like seeing the joy a gift can bring. Liam, how about you? Well, that's easy. In a previous relationship, I was with someone who adored the holidays. Last year, she wrote me a message and put it in my work bag every day, for 12 days before Christmas. They were either little memories were shared together or hopes for the future. As soon as I read one, I just couldn't wait to open the next. I always looked forward to the next day. She sounds very special. That must be very painful for you. Not really. It's a good reminder of how to treat the person you love and to cherish the moments you share together. If you take them for granted, you might lose a chance to tell them how you really feel and they could be gone forever. Hey guys, what I miss? Oh, well, Liam was just filling us in on his favorite Christmas memory. And a beautiful one, it was too. Mine has to be this place. Every year, I look forward to coming back and seeing all your faces. Juliet, why did you start this retreat? Oh, well that is, it's a tale as old as time. I moved to the states for love and he left me, so I suddenly found myself alone at Christmas, hundreds of miles from home. So I decided to create this, a place where single people can come and enjoy the holidays together. Doesn't have to be miserable just because you're alone. And if you found love again, would you keep this place open? I can't ever imagine giving up this place. But enough about me, I want to hear about all of you. Nola, would you like to share with the group? Oh, I have so many. So, three years ago we were building a snowman and I didn't have a nose. "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" Yes, yes. Okay. Sit down, sit down. I need to explain the rules. Okay, so we've all played this before. Okay, you draw a Christmas idea out of Santa's hat, you perform it and your partner tries to guess. Sound good? Yes. Brilliant, let's go, Harry, you're up? All right, all right. Two words, first word. "Silent Night." Yes. Unbelievable. Ready? I'm ready. - Are you here? - I'm with you. Let's do it. Four words. That's the smoke. Blanket. Sweater. You? Two syllable. Time. Oh very impressive you two. Very impressive. Okay, last contestants, Liam and Morgan. Don't suck. It's gonna be hard. How am I supposed to do this? Keep your clue hidden. Okay. - Three words. - Okay. First word. Oh, Christmas lights. Putting up Christmas lights. Hanging Christmas lights up. Icicles. Popsicles. Frozen. 30 Seconds. Okay, okay. Second word sounds like first word, okay. Laughing, funny. Santa, ho, ho, ho. 10 Seconds. Why are you so, so bad at this? Why am I so bad at this? Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you? No, because you're not doing the job. And time. You know you're not supposed to talk during your time. Not a chance. Holly Jolly Christmas. Second word sounds like first word. You know, that's a bad clue. I didn't even get the first word. Hey, guys, guys, guys, come on. There's no need to bicker. It's just a game. A game that Harry and I won. Woo. Okay, so the winner for tonight's game gets to choose the secret Santa first. What's so funny? We were awful. We were worse than awful. Seeing as we don't make such a great team. Lionel, hey. Me, okay. You're not joining in? Oh, Euchre, no. You know how competitive I am? Yes I do. I'm trying to make friends not enemies. Makes sense. They look so in love. Are we still playing, are we still playing the game? I would like it, it'd be great. Still playing game? Okay, I'll go, I'll go then. I wonder when David's gonna tell her how he feels. Morgan. That's really sweet, but they're just friends. He's a bachelor for life. I don't think he's ever gonna wanna change the good set up he's got. And are we still friends? I'd like us to be. Yeah, of course. I'm happy that we can be like this, after everything. Yeah, me too. You seemed to be having loads of fun playing cards earlier, with David. What are you trying to say, Morgan? I'm not prying. I just have to wonder if maybe there's something more between the two of you. Like, if the happiest time for you each year is coming here, maybe it isn't just the lovely decor and the military-like schedule of Christmas activities. You're not wrong. And David and I are really good friends. He makes me happy. And he makes me smile. And those are things that I honestly didn't know would happen again. So yeah, I enjoy his company. But I don't lie to myself about us being more than what we are. There's only a few more days left until the stay is over. You don't need to remind me. I've tried to reach out in the past. And I just feel like he wasn't very receptive. But Liam, is that your first love or just the guy that broke your heart? Because I think it's the latter. I don't know what you're talking about. Well, I see pain in your eyes, every time you look at him. I'm always right about these things. My husband used to find it very annoying. So your secret is safe with me. Liam used to find that very annoying about me too. You got me. We dated for five years. Everything was perfect. Initially I was the one who saw a marriage, like a life sentence. And he agreed. But as my love for him grew, I began to realize that it's not hard to commit to someone for a lifetime, if they're truly the one. Unfortunately Liam doesn't feel the same way. And after all this time, he should know whether or not I'm his soul mate. So we broke up and as a cruel twist of fate, look where we both ended up. I'm sorry. I know it's probably really hard to see him. Yeah, it's not been the escape from heartbreak that I planned. Well, if it makes you feel better, I think he's also struggling with it. Every time you look see you, it's these eyes that are clearly still in love. Yeah, there's love for each other. I'm sure of it. Is that enough? Well, true love, doesn't come around every day. You know, love is one of the most precious things on earth and every love story is unique. So who knows? - Wise words Nola. - Thank you. I hope you're listening to yourself. Do you want us both to get kicked out? I hope Juliet doesn't hear you. Did you get a chance to buy your secret Santa gift yet? No, I will try tomorrow morning. How about you, you have any luck? Yeah, I got mine. That must be a load off. Yes it is. Hey, this will make you laugh. I was chatting with Morgan earlier and she said, how you and Nola look like an item. An item, really? Funny right? I think women try to read too much into everything. I let her know you were an eternal bachelor. Think she'll tell Nola? I doubt it. Why, would that bother you? Wait, do you have feelings for Nola? I don't know what to do. I've never felt like this about anyone. I mean, of course I want to tell her of course, but what if she is not ready or worse, what if she doesn't feel the same? Nah, nah, nah, nah, I'd wait years if she would take me as her husband. Marriage? But I thought. What, that I would choose to be a bachelor for the rest of my life? Why do you think I'm here, to make ugly stockings with you, growing old alone? No. I wasn't blessed to find the one earlier in life. I was happy waiting. Because I knew true love was worth it. She's worth it. And I would give up the bachelor life and dedicate every day to loving her if she would just choose me. So yeah, I have feelings for Nola. Hey, I was looking for you. You have a minute? What's up? So I spoke to David and you were right. I should know by now that you're always right. I didn't see it. David is in love with Nola but he's terrified of telling her. And there's only three days left before they have to wait a whole other year to see each other. I don't know what he's waiting for, a light encouragement. I know Nola feels the same. I would hate for them to leave and never find out. Should we do something to help in some way? What could we do? I'm not sure we should interfere. No, we probably shouldn't. But we could set up an opportunity for them. I mean, it's nearly impossible for them to have any time romantically with Juliet keeping such a close eye on all of us. But if she wants us to fall in love with the holidays again, what better way than helping two people find true love at Christmas? Hey guys, we got some fresh cookies in here. Thanks, we'll be right there. Also Juliet wants to remind us for working on our Secret Santa gifts. Thanks. Cool. I think I have an idea. What could be a better Christmas gift than a perfect first date? It's a great idea, I would, but my secret Santa isn't Nola. Well mine is. Swap? Absolutely. Okay, so Morgan and I will organize it all tomorrow. So as to not raise suspicion. Thanks guys. I'm so excited. Okay, let's get back downstairs before Juliet calls out a search party for us. Good call. So, she believed you? I told Juliet we were going Secret Santa shopping, which technically is not lie because we are shopping for Secret Santa. Just not ours. Right. Right. Okay, we need to be efficient. You get everything on the top half of the list and I'll start from the bottom. Yes, Ma'am. Your idea of a horse and carriage ride around the park with a picnic is quite romantic. You must have been disappointed with our dates. No. Not at all. Remember the time we had to cancel our cabin weekend because of the snowstorm. I was so upset. Remember how you threw down pillows on the floor and put up sheets and we camped indoors next to the fireplace. You didn't think it was crazy? No, I mean, I knew you're crazy. Thanks. But it was fun and romantic. And it was nice to have the comforts of indoor plumbing and heat, which I was very grateful for. That was a great night. I have a confession. You do? I'm actually happier here. Obviously, it was a bit of a shock at first, but it's nice having you around. Thanks. I guess we get one more Christmas together. Hey Sam. Hello. This is gorgeous. Oh, thanks. We've got everything they need in the basket. And I've got a big blanket for them as well. If you could just heat up the cocoa before you schedule arrival, that would be perfect. Don't worry. Everything will go according to plan. Thank you so much. This is gonna be the best first Christmas date ever. Do you have any other bookings before this evening's big extravaganza? No, we don't have anything going. Could you squeeze in the last minute ride? We sure could. Thanks. You want some too? We probably shouldn't tell David and Nola that we tried it out before them. I hope she likes it. Of course you will. It's the best gift ever. Even I would like this. Oh really? That's high praise coming from the man who is impossible to shop for. I'm not impossible. When I like something, I buy it. 'Cause you have no patience. And then you leave me with absolutely nothing to get you. Why wait if I need or like something? Because each gift has a special memory attached to it. I don't need a thing to remember the special moments we've shared together. Morgan, I think you should know that I lied to you earlier. Andy didn't bail the last minute. The trip was always for me. I thought it might help me get over you. I'm sorry, I'm not laughing at you. It's just the truth is I came here to try to get over you too. And has it worked? Okay guys, this is your stop. And don't worry, I'll be ready with everything. Thank you so much. And this Secret Santa's for David. Oh, David sends his apologies, but he's not feeling too well. So he won't be able to join us this evening. Oh, what a shame. He seemed fine earlier. We'll just leave it for him for later. Oh. Oh. This one's for you. Thank you. I can't believe it. Thank you whoever you are. This is such a special gift. My dad used to read a letter from this book to my sister and me, every night at bedtime leading up to Christmas. It truly means so much. What a thoughtful gift. Okay, who's next? Nola. Your turn. Thank you. Merry Christmas, my dear Nola. Your gift waits for you outside. From your secret admirer, who has adored you for years, please make an excuse to leave and tell the group your present is spa vouchers. Well, we're all waiting. What did you get? Spa vouchers. - Oh. - Oh. I guess I have two. Oh lovely, nice detox to look forward to in the new year. Yeah, I'm gonna step outside really quickly. It's just, I need some air, it's a little hot. I will be right back. Lionel. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I actually should go probably check on Nola and make sure she's doing okay. But you guys carry on. Oh, all right. Just carry on. Okay. Oh see, that's what I'm talking about. You guys know me so well. Ah, yeah. Thank you, thank you. Next one. Juliet. Have you had a chance to try some of Harry's chocolates yet? I hear there's something else? Oh. Yes, did you know we have over 70 different distinct chocolates? I did not know that. I brought a sample of them as a token of appreciation for your hospitality. How thoughtful. It's been a pleasure, love. Have you tried dark chocolate from the jungles of Guatemala? I have not. Oh, Guatemala. Darling, you haven't lived until you've had our exotic cacao brownies. These are some of my personal favorites. For you. Thank you. Very fancy. Oh, hey sorry guys. I have to take this really important work call but enjoy the chocolates. Hi Nola. Hi. Yeah. This might come as a shock to you. If I told you my feelings for you were completely platonic, I'd be lying. Truth is, I am so in love with you. I love you from the moment we first met. And I'm not trying to pressure you or anything but by chance you feel for me, the way that I feel for you, then promise me you won't come back here next year. Instead, next Christmas, we spend together. And every other day. That is the most romantic thing I have ever seen. I thought you never asked. These are for you. So yeah. What? Yeah. How did you know? I just knew. And it was obvious. Didn't you see the way he looks at her? Now they have each other. Looks like we don't make such a bad team after all. You know what I didn't you're right. I regret not planning more things like this from us, when we were together. You always did so much for me. My surprise birthday party, organizing our trip to Europe. You were always so much better at it than I was. Well you were important to me and I wanted you to feel that. I did. I'm sorry, I didn't let you know. I wish I could have given you what you needed. It was never about the wedding. It was about the commitment. Morgan. Liam. Nola. Darlings, where are you? Come out, come out wherever you are. We should probably head back and help cover for David and Nola. Let's do it. It's just so nice to see Nola and David happy and together. It's made this whole trip worthwhile. Is that the only reason? What does that mean? You haven't mentioned Liam this entire time and now I'm worried. Why? Because it's what you're not saying. You should be ranting and raving about how awful your ex is and how happy you are that it's over. But I know that look Morg, you aren't falling in love with him again are you? What if I was too hard on him about the whole marriage thing? Was that really enough to end it? We were happy. No, Morgan don't do this to yourself. It's been a long day. I'm gonna get some sleep. Okay, well we'll be home tomorrow, and if you wanted to leave a day earlier, I would love to see you. Thanks sis, night. Night. Mind if I join you? Of course, sit. It's so cozy. As a child, my father would make a roaring fire every night during the winter. I miss it. Sweet. You seem so much more relaxed than before. I am. This place is definitely working. Getting your holiday spirit back. I think so. It's definitely better than I initially expected. What are you drinking? Oh, there's fresh Mulled Wine in the kitchen. Oh, I'm gonna grab a cup, do you need. No sit, let me. Such a gentleman. Of course. Hey. Hey, how's it going? Good. Heard from David that there's fresh batch of Mulled Wine in the kitchen. All yours. Are you enjoying it? Your stay, I mean. Oh. Yeah, it's getting better every day. Morgan's amazing, isn't she? Yeah, she is. You two seem to get on well. She's hard not to like. Tell me about it. But you two aren't, you aren't? Aren't what? Oh, you mean a thing? No, no. No, no. No, we're just getting to know each other, like we all are. I'm getting to know everyone in the group. Funny, Morgan told me she has nothing in common with you, but I could have sworn there was something between you two. I thought I was gonna have to report you to Juliet. No, no, no. No, I came to a singles retreat for a reason to escape all that relationship drama. That's good to know. Enjoy your Mulled Wine. You as well. What's so entertaining? Oh it's just one of the letters for my Christmas book. I can read the same one over and over again and sill laugh. They're so funny. Well, I'm glad you like it. Hey, I actually wanted to speak to you about something. Oh? Last night got me thinking. Are you still searching for ideas to expand your business into the holiday market? Well, I've been having so much fun here that I haven't been thinking about work, which is great. But tomorrow I'm leaving without having accomplished my goal. So yes, very much so. Oh, why do you have something? Maybe. If you don't mind me saying your chocolate advent calendars, don't stand out from the others. What if the chocolate enclosures doubled as a placeholder for notes, which the buyer wrote every day, each note being something they love and that they're grateful for. And then when the chocolates are all gone, they'll have 25 special moments to read in one go. It's beautiful for families, but it's also perfect for single people. We'll get 25 sweet messages to read on Christmas day. The ad campaign will tell consumers that your company cares about more than just selling candy. You care about creating magic memories during the holidays. What do you think? Wow. That's amazing. You like it? No, I love it. It's gonna be a big success, I just know it. Thank you so much. You're incredible, you know that. I am so pleased that you like it. I'm gonna go draft up some mock slogans for you to take a look at. Great. Okay, sounds good. Hey, I was looking for you. You were? Yeah. I wanted to thank you for the Christmas gift. I knew it was from you. You did? Of course. Don't you remember our first date? You're the only one who would've known those stories about my childhood. I bought it as one of your Christmas gifts this year, but when we broke up, I just couldn't throw it away. I was hoping there'd be some way to give it to you. Well, I guess this trip brought us together for some reason. Including helping you with whatever you're doing. I've been assigned by Juliet to make Christmas crackers and to fill 'em with corny jokes for tonight's dinner. Well, I know you won't have any trouble with the corny jokes. Ho, ho, ho. But if you need a hand making these. Yeah, I think I will actually. I'll take you up on that. All right, pass me a card. Okay, here we go. And funny joke, you're all set. Will you pass me the cover. Yeah, here you go. Trying. Yeah. Joked. Okay. - All right, well. - All right. That should be done, yeah. All right, that should about do it. Mission accomplished. We should definitely do this again next year. Yeah, we should. Yeah, you'd want to? You think you wanna see me outside of here? Yes, yes I would. Okay, shall we? We shall. One, two, three. You win this round. - Ah. - Ooh. Ooh. Who knew there'd be a crown. Oh, okay, this is one of the ones I wrote. Okay. Are you ready? Oh, yeah, born ready? It's really funny. I'll be the judge of that. Where does Santa go to relax after he delivers all the presents? I don't know, an iceberg. No, I give up. A ho, ho, hotel. That's not even a joke. Mine are way better. Well, we'll have to wait and see. Oh, I'm confident. Here, you've won this. I'll open this delicately since you ripped so many in the process. Why, why thank you. Oh wow. Oh. How do I look? So regal. So beautiful. Oh, hi guys. Hi. Oh, those crackers are looking cracking. Yes they are. Do you think there's enough? I think there are plenty. Lovely. Morgan, I was hoping we could speak privately for a moment. Is everything okay? It's a delicate matter. Liam, would you mind? Not a problem. You're in trouble. Please. I have never been in this position before. I made it crystal clear at the beginning that this program is only for singles and I would not tolerate dating because it would completely undermine the purpose of the program. With this in mind, and whilst it has been a pleasure hosting you, you have given me no option, but to ask you to kindly pack up your things and leave. Leave? Yes. What's happened to everybody? Cookies, I think I left my cookies in the room. Go grab the cookies. The retreat is a sanctuary for lonely people to come together and not feel the pressure of relationships. It's a safe space where they don't have loved-up couples thrust in their faces. We are not a sleazy pickup joint. We are here to value the true meaning of Christmas without depending on someone else to enjoy it. You have violated these rules. Juliet, I am so sorry, I didn't tell you earlier. I didn't know that he was going to be here. I tried not to have feelings for him, but just seeing him here, it was was hard. David and Nola, I have come to know you both as family over the years. How did I not see this happening? Five years. You've looked after us both for five years, made us feel welcome. It's been a joy celebrating the holidays with you. But we found love. And yes, we broke your rules. And it was worth it. Thank you, Juliet. You brought us together. Yes, well you shouldn't have done it. But if you have found true love, then of course I am happy for you. Thank you. But I still need you both to go. Thank you, Juliet. Take care. Juliet, I've really enjoyed my time here. But I think it's evident that Morgan and I have a chance at something more than friendship. What? No, we're just friends. We're just friends. It's fine, darling, she understands, she knows. I think it's best that you leave before the group come down to dinner. Understood. Juliet, I never did anything or felt anything for Harry. I promise. Well, it didn't look like that to me. No, you got it all wrong. I actually had a relationship here with, but we're just friends so we really haven't broken any of your rules. Hold on. Is there someone else here that I need to ask to leave? No, no, of course not, nevermind. Thanks for everything, Juliet. And Merry Christmas. Liam? Hey, I thought we should talk, work out where we go from here. Oh right. Oh Harry, you didn't think that there was something between the two of us, did you? Isn't there? Morgan, I would like to take you up to dinner now that the rules don't apply to us. I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. I really enjoy your company, but I have feelings for someone else. Liam? What makes you say that? I was hoping it wasn't the case, but I've had the feeling that there was something between the two of you. He's a lucky guy. Liam is my ex. We broke up a few weeks ago. But I'm just not sure if things are really over between the two of us. Please don't tell Juliet, I don't want him to be forced to leave. Well, okay, but Morgan, just be careful. I spoke with him earlier and he was very clear, he was looking to escape relationship drama. Really? Yes. His words. You are amazing. I would hate to see you get hurt. Thank you. I hope I didn't hurt your feelings. No, it's fine. I'm okay. Hey Harry, before you go, I know it's none of my business, but I see the way Juliet looks at you. And I think you two would make a great couple. Juliet? You're kidding, she'd never be interested. I can tell she's smitten. She runs a singles retreat. Well, she's looking for love, just like everyone else. She's just afraid to get hurt again. I guess I thought I'd never stand a chance. Trust me, I'm usually right about these things. Merry Christmas, Harry. Merry Christmas. Liam. Liam, are you there? Leave a message. Emma, I need to come over now. I had to leave early, but I'll explain when I get there. Liam, there you are. Dinner's almost ready, so we'll be sitting down soon. Okay great. I'll just freshen up and be down shortly. Is Morgan upstairs? Actually, Morgan's already checked out. She's left? Look, I didn't want the news to affect the other guests, but unfortunately four of our friends will not be joining us. David and Nola are in a relationship, so they're gonna spend Christmas together. And Morgan and Harry are also secretly romantically involved. It's very disappointing. There must be some mistake. They aren't a couple. Well, when I confronted her about it, she said, and I quote, I didn't want to have feelings, but seeing him here, I couldn't help not to. But don't worry, we won't let this spoil our Christmas fun. Tonight, we're gonna do some more Christmas games and then sing some Christmas carols. I'm sorry, but I won't be joining. Why not? I think my time here is over too. I need to head back home and spend Christmas with my roommate. I'll go get my things. Oh no, no, Liam, please. Sorry, Juliet. Dear Santa, this season has been nothing I could have ever imagined. I was running away from life, love and Christmas. Fate showed me that I have to face hardships front on. You have to get back out there and take a chance on love again, that realization reignited my Christmas spirit. The holiday season reminds us of our happiest memories and brings us hope for an ever better future. Who would've thought that what I really needed this year was to be trapped in this heartbreak, B&B with my ex Liam. Juliet created this retreat so that singles wouldn't feel alone during Christmas. And because of this two wonderful people found true love. I pray you'll help Juliet reopen her heart to romance. As she's been using this place as her crutch. Please help her to believe and love again. Morgan. Special delivery for Morgan. It's from Harry. "Thank you, Morgan, for your kind words of encouragement. "Juliet and I had the most amazing date "and we're spending Christmas together. "I can't wait to start on the marketing campaign. "See you soon, Harry." That was so sweet of him. Yeah, so thoughtful. Although I know it's not from who you were hoping you would be. Come on, let's go open some more of your presents. You've been deliberately avoiding this. Why? Because I know it's from Morgan. David, let it slip, he had my name before they swapped. And I'm not really sure if I need another reminder of my ex right now. Dude, just get over yourself. It's probably just on socks. Open it. Come on. Thank you for keeping our secret. When you first showed up. Well don't leave me hanging. What do they say? All right. This one says, "Thank you for inspiring an ad campaign "for Harry's business. "I always thought you found these handwritten notes lame. "I didn't realize how much they meant to you. "Showing me how much the little things mattered, "inspired me and me have saved my career." Now that sounds like she loves you. I've saved the last note as the most important message of all. I never stopped loving you. And I never will. Wherever life takes you, I hope it's filled with love and happiness. Merry Christmas, Liam. Well. What are you gonna do? I'm a mess without her. I can definitely vouch for that. Look, you're your best self when you're with her. You'd be a fool to let her go. You're right. You're right. Guys Santa's here. What Santa? Well, there's a sleigh, but no reindeer. I think she just had a bit too much hot chocolate today. I think you should go look outside. Coming. Let's go. Liam. What are you doing here? I had to see you. You left without saying goodbye and I thought you left with Harry. Harry, no Juliet got it all wrong. I know. I went to look for you, but you weren't there. I had a good reason. Morgan, I love you. I fell in love with you the moment I first saw you. You were the best thing that ever happened to me, but I let my insecurities get the best of me. I'm sorry for that. I left yesterday because I had to go on a very important shopping trip. Morgan, will you make me the happiest man in the world?
