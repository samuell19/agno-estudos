[ MUSIC ] [ MUSIC ] Gruss: THEY CAUGHT ME AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS ON A PLUGOT ROUND-UP. PLUGOTS ARE WHAT THE FRAULS CALLED US THEN. THAT'S A FRAUL. THEY RAN EVERYTHING. AND THAT'S ME, GRUSS, A PRISONER IN THE COMB OF THE FRISCOS. THEIR RULER, THE TIARA, SHE WAS GIVING US HOT SCAN DECIDING WHAT SHE WAS GONNA DO WITH US. I DIDN'T NEED HEAVY SMARTS TO FIGURE THINGS WERE GOING COLD NEGGY. THAT MEANS VERY BAD. Reya: SEEDER. MACHO. MACHO. THE FRAULS CALLED THEIR SLAVES, "MACHOS." THEY DID ALL THE HARD WORK. SURE WASN'T SOMETHING I WANTED TO BE. SPIRITED. SEEDER. MACHOS. MARK IT. SEEDERS WERE FOR ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY, MAKING BABY FRAULS. THE TIARA HAD PICKED KORVIS OUT FOR HER OWN DAUGHTER, VENA. [ SCREAMING ] DIDN'T TAKE MUCH TO GET THE FRAULS EXCITED. THE LEAST LITTLE THING WOULD SET THEM OFF. [ SHOUTING ] GET THAT PLUGOT! [ GROANING ] I WAS HOT SCANNING FOR A WAY OUT. I DECIDED TO TAKE THE FIRST OFFER THAT CAME ALONG. [ MUSIC ] WE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE OLD RADIATION ZONE. THE FRAULS CALL IT THE CONTAMS. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE'D FIND THERE, BUT WE KNEW ONE THING, THEY WOULDN'T FOLLOW US INSIDE. IT WAS AGAINST THEIR REGS, THEIR RULES. [ SHOUTING ] [ MUSIC ] IT WAS COLD, HARD, BUT WE SURVIVED. ONE DAY, KORVIS AND ME WERE SCROUNGING FOR SOMETHING WE COULD USE. WHAT WE FOUND WOULD CHANGE OUR WORLD FOREVER. UH, NOT THE HAT, THE BOOK. [ MUSIC ] DETERMINED TO FREE OURSELVES FROM THE FRAULS, WE BANDED TOGETHER IN THE CONTAMS. WE BUILT OUR OWN COMB OUT OF PIECES OF A NUKED MERICANS' BASE CALLED CAMP REAGAN. I NEVER DID FIGURE OUT WHAT A REAGAN WAS. Korvis: HOORSSE. HO-RSSSE-- HORSE. MMM-- MMMAAAN. MAN. MAN. MAN! MAN! NOT A PLUGOT. I'M A MAN! I'M A MAN. [ INDISTINCT MUMBLING ] [ MUSIC ] TO THE FRAULS, ALL MEN WERE PLUGOTS, BUT THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE HAIRY BEASTS AND US. [ GRUNTING ] THEY WERE DUMB AND HUNGRY. REALLY DUMB AND REALLY HUNGRY. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] IN THOSE DAYS, THERE WAS NEGGY SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH. YOU GOT WHAT YOU WORKED FOR. [ SHOUTING ] [ MUSIC ] TAKING CHARGE, VENA SNAPPED INTO ACTION! [ GROWLING ] PLUGOTS STARTED SCURRYING BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH. MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE COMB, THINGS WERE GOING ON AS USUAL. LAKELLA, THE TIARA'S SECOND, OR NEXT IN LINE, WAS SHARPENING UP HER ACT. A FRAUL WAS TAKING HER FINAL WARRIOR'S TEST, TRYING TO SURVIVE A MEETING WITH AARGH, THE AWFUL. FALLOUT FROM THE GREAT NUKE HAD FORCED AARGH TO TAKE A DETOUR FROM THE HUMAN RACE. AND FROM THE SCAN OF HIM, HE WAS NEGGY GONNA FIND THE WAY BACK. [ GROWLING ] [ BELL RINGING ] OH MY!

YOU ARE NOW. LISTEN. IN MY SHELT, A MAP. FOLLOW IT. REYA, PLEASE! I DON'T WANT TO BE TIARA! COLD. TIARA! TIARA! SISTER? Lakella: I SERVE THE TIARA. HOT. WHILE THE FRAULS WERE WEEPING, KORVIS AND ME WERE SCROUNGING. SCANNED LIKE SOME TASTY LEFT-OVERS. I WENT FOR THE WEAPS. KORVIS WENT FOR THE EATS. HE FOUND MORE THAN HE BARGAINED FOR. AMIE. AMIE WAS AN ESCAPED TOY. FRAULS KEPT THEM AS PETS, CALLED THEM TOYS. TO MAKE PLASTIC SURE THEY'D STAY QUIET, THEY CUT OFF THEIR TONGUES. TO KEEP 'EM JELLO, THEY CUT OFF SOMETHIN' ELSE. [ BELL RINGING ] [ MUSIC ] I, LAKELLA, SECOND TO VENA, TIARA OF FRISCO, GIVE YOU SAFE SHELTER. I, FREYHA, SECOND TO MORHA, TIARA OF KANSOS, ACCEPT YOUR SAFE SHELTER. Morha: HOT SURPRISE, EH, LAKELLA?

PLENTY OF TIME FOR BOTH, VENA. ONCE, THE WORLD WAS GREEN, AND LIVIN'. THEN WAS THE GREAT NUKE. DEATH LIVED EVERYWHERE. ALL WERE BORN SICK AND UNCLEAN. A LIVIN' CURSE FROM THE MERICANS AND COMMIES. THEN ONE DAY, A BABY WAS BORN, CLEAN AND CLEAR, AND THE LIVIN' CURSE WAS OVER! THE CHILD GREW STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL, AND SHE WAS CALLED-- WOMAN! WOMAN TAUGHT HER CHILDREN TO FOLLOW THE TIARA, AND OBEY THE REGS, AND THE EARTH LIVED AGAIN! BUT SOME DISOBEYED THE REGS, AND FROM THEM CAME THE CHILDREN OF DARKNESS AND DISEASE. PLUGOTS!
