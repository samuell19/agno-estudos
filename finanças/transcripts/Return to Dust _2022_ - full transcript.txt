I hope not Because you can't move if your feet 'grow' in the field Either the wind will blow you down... Or the donkey will nibble you... Or you'll be pecked by sparrows, or cut by sickles Being stuck in the field is to suffer That's right Feet let people walk around They're better off than crops and vegetables grown in the field Things grown in the field can't go anywhere Exposed to wind and sun... Living, then dying... Never leaving the field That's right Mind you, though... Where can our feet take us?
