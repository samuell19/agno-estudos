It's two plus two equals six. I will never tell you. But you will. OPERATION DUNKIRK The enemy attacked us on all sides with great strength and fierceness. Pressing in upon the narrow exit, both from the east and from the west, the enemy began to fire with cannon upon the beaches by which alone the shipping could approach or depart. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy with the willing help of countless Merchant Seamen strained every nerve to embark the British and Allied troops. Two hundred and twenty light warships and 650 other vessels were engaged. They had to operate upon a difficult coast often in adverse weather under an almost ceaseless hail of bombs and an increasing concentration of artillery fire. Nor were the seas, as I have said, themselves free from mines and torpedoes. It was in conditions such as these that our men carried on with little or no rest. For days and nights on end, making trip after trip across the dangerous waters, bringing with them always men whom they had rescued. Attention! At ease. Lt. Calloway? This must be your lucky day. You're not being evacuated. You might actually live another day. It's a ruddy bloodbath out there! Gentlemen, battles will be won by the side that first spots enemy airplanes, ships or submarines. And British scientists have been working feverishly to develop radar technology that will see for hundreds of miles, even at night. But they haven't been able to crack it. Just recently, we got intelligence from the Americans. The Americans? Yes. Seems a German scientist has developed this technology but doesn't want to share it with Hitler. I know. Whatever his reasons, he wants to share it with us. Therefore, I need you and your men to go retrieve the package. The package being? The German scientist. Do we know where this package is, sir? Yes. We're being told the French Resistance has the German scientist in a safe house not far from here. He's being held here in an old factory right off of L'Autoroute A25. That's 51 degrees north, 37 east. You're to go there, rendezvous with the French, retrieve the package, and get out. Any questions? Much enemy activity in the area, sir? From our reports, little to none. The French are expecting you. Once you've made contact, they will ask you for a piece of paper. Give them this. Sir. Any more questions? So we're not going to be evacuated, then. Is that it? You have your orders. Pull your balls out of your throat and be a soldier! - Yes, sir! - Get your kit together and get ready to move out. Do you understand me? Yes, sir! This mission could not only save lives, but win the war. Carry on. You heard the colonel. Little to no enemy activity. We get in, we get out. We don't miss the evacuation. Just one last roll of the dice, lads. Let's go. Should be just over this field. Better proceed with caution. Into the bushes! You must love your family very much, no? Do you realize that we know where they are? My soldiers are on their way right now to pick them up. Mein familia has nothing to do with this! No! Tell me! Okay. Okay. I give it to a young woman, French Resistance on her way to BAF now. Angelique! Show me where she is. They will see you soon enough. Everything all right, Thomas? It's my son's birthday in two weeks. I just really wanted to see him. I haven't seen him yet since he was born. Don't worry about it, Thomas. You'll see him on his next birthday, yeah? You can tell him what a hero his father is. Never actually been with a woman myself. You never been with a woman? Not intimately, no. So you've not had a shag? Such a romantic, Walker. Let's just find this kraut, and get the hell out of France, yeah? What do you say? I hate this country. It stinks. Lieutenant, all due respect, how do we know we can trust this scientist? He is German, after all. Because cleverer men than us have told us so. Well, they better be right. This must be it, lads. Stay sharp. Drop your weapons! Lower your guns! I said drop your guns! Turn! Turn slowly to me! Turn slowly! What is your business here? We're with the British Expeditionary Force. We've come to collect a package. You should have a package for me. Yes. Yes, I do. Read it. Read it to me! "The children long to play in the fields but had to settle instead for the sand which was accompanied by an enormous roar." All right, where is he? How many are with you? Just the five of us. All right, where is he? She is inside. Wait. She? You did not know. No. I thought we were collecting the chap with the algorithm for radar. You were until he was captured by Nazi but moments before this. He gave the algorithm. To Angelique. Angelique? - Oui. - All right, let's go. Angelique? C'est moi, Pierre. Don't shoot, don't shoot. This is her. You have the algorithm? - Oui. - May I see it? I have not written it down. So you must keep me alive. Very sensible. Then we should leave. What's the plan? We must get her to this location. They will further assist her. They have arranged a plane to take her to Great Britain. But we must wait for the Americans. They're already late. So I'm assuming the worst. We need to move. Shit! We've got company! So much for little to no enemy activity. Take cover. I'll see if I can delay them. All right, let's dig in, lads. We were given a mission and I plan on completing it. Harris, get me the colonel on the wireless. Yes, sir. F13C here. Come in, Dunkirk. F13C. This is Colonel Plummer. Sir, I have the colonel. We're at the destination, sir. But the package isn't here. There is a French girl with the Resistance. Said she was given the algorithm by the scientist before he was captured by the Nazis. Has she showed it to you? Says she has it memorized, sir. Blood hell! That changes things. One more thing, sir. We also appear to have company. How many? Difficult to say. Looks like a transport heading our way. Get your asses out of there before they arrive! Those are your orders! Understood, sir. F13C out. You don't trust me? They've arrived! It's the Germans. On the left and right. We know you are in there! Come out! She's in there right now. Yes, sir, but she has been joined by five BAF soldiers. And they are in there right now? Are you sure? Yes, sir. They just arrived maybe four or five minutes ago. They are well-armed. And the Americans? No, sir. I have not seen them. And she has the algorithm for sure? Oui. What is he doing? Excellent work. Merci, sir. May I leave? You have five seconds to run for your life. No! No, sir! Sir, no! Please! No, no! Damn it! The traitor sold us out. Let's concentrate on the task in hand. I count ten men. Same here, sir. Can we trust you? I risked my life to fight the Germans! I watched as my mother and father begged for their life and the life of my brother and sister! They were only eight and nine years old! They'll do the same thing to her if we leave her. No one said anything about leaving her. We heard the colonel, sir. You swear you have the algorithm? It's all I have! We know you are in there! To the British soldiers inside: Send us the girl and you will all go free. Otherwise, you will experience the same fate as your French friend here. She will never give the algorithm to the Allies. Ever! You send her out, you will all go free! You have two minutes to send her out. No. No, no, please! Please! Please! I am telling the truth! Please! Please, you must believe me! Please! Gentlemen? Speak freely, lads. You heard the colonel. You know the mission. Well, I want to go home. We don't even know if she has the algorithm. And how do we know this algorithm can even do what people say it can? Give her to them. How can we really trust her? I couldn't live with myself if we turned her in, sir. Let's complete the mission. I've always thought it's a soldier's duty to protect those who can't protect themselves. Now there are ten of them to our five, but we have the elevated position. But, Lieutenant, they may have reinforcements? Yes, that's quite possible, Harris. But sometimes a man has to take a stand on principle. No matter the consequences. I'm with you, sir. You say and I'll fill them so full of lead, it'll be coming out their eyes. Thank you, gentlemen. You will not regret this! Thank you. All right, Fritz, we've talked. We're not bringing her out, so you're gonna have to come in and get her! Fire! Pull out! Pull out! Patch him up, man. Am I gonna die? - No. - Am I gonna die? Am I gonna die? Shit! Am I gonna die? Damn it! Sir! I have some dynamite! Let me set a trap. I'll blow these bastards to smithereens. Schreck! I've got a schreck here! God, then we're out-gunned! We gotta get outta here! Any ideas? Let's go out the back way! I know the forest! King, Walker, on Thomas! Go! Thomas, let's go! Let's keep moving. Come on. Chins up. That's it. This way. All right, mighty forty, everyone down here. Come on! Stay with me. Come on. We're getting out of here. We're getting out of here. Come on! Hold it together, Thomas! We've got to move on, man! We're working on this together. Pull it together, Thomas. So any chance of getting medical support for Thomas? The wireless was destroyed. There's no calling anyone. Are you sure we can trust this location that he gave us? Oui. I mean, he was working for the Germans, it may be compromised. I don't think so. I don't think Pierre expected us to escape. You know? Yes. You may have a point. Damn it, we need a radio! We need to pause! I know a safe house. It might have a radio. - How far? - Not far. - Shit! - Sir! Sir, he's not doing so well. Sir, they're getting closer. We'll never outrun them. Especially with him in this state. Well, we can't just leave him here! You are... You have to. I'm not going to make it. I know that. And you know that. This can't be all for nothing. You said we could be heroes. Now get her to safety! You're coming with us, Thomas. We're gonna get you home to see your wife and son. You lads can do it, but not with me. Not with me! You get home to England. You tell my son what I did. You tell him I was a hero. I shall. Reach into my pocket. - Here. - This one? There. There's a letter. Please... Please give this to my wife. You tell her... You tell her that I loved her the minute I have laid eyes on her. I promise. You keep that promise. I will. I will, Thomas. All right. Now... Now sit me up against that tree. And hand me my gun. You don't have to do this, Thomas. Yes, I do. Now go! Monsieur, I'm so sorry. Go! Let's go. Come on, you bloody krauts! Schiesse! That'll slow 'em down. But it won't stop 'em. If Angelique's secret is as valuable as we think, - then nothing will stop them. - It is. Well, at least Thomas has bought us enough time to gain some distance. It's just north, a few kilometers. Let's move on. Everyone stays alert. We need to rest. All right, let's stop just for a moment. Be sure and conserve water. These blisters are killing me. Sir, I've got ammunition here! Stop! Freeze, King! Don't move. Shit! Is it booby trapped? Yes, sir. With a compression mine. Attached to a grenade. A stick grenade, sir. Do you see where it's connected? Yes, sir. About six feet to my left. Mr. King, I need you to ever so slightly point to where the grenade is. Don't move your head or your hips at all. Do you understand? Just turn your wrist and point. Do you see it? Yes. Yes, I see it. Could we cut the wire? I need you to stay very, very still. We're going to get you out of this. You have to absolutely not budge in the slightest. Yes, sir. How bad is it? They've double-rigged it. There's a compression mine under the butt of the rifle. As long as he keeps pressure on that, it won't detonate. But the wire that's attached to the grenade is already under tension. We clip that, the charge will blow. Shit. What do we do? I'm never going to be with a woman now, am I, sir? Stay calm, Mr. King. We've got to do something. He's already struggling. Those Nazis can't be too far back. What are you thinking, sir? The only thing I can do is try to tackle him out of the blast area. That's insane! And keep your voice down, man! We need to keep him steady. Are you losing your mind, Lieutenant. With all due respect, sir. Well, do you have a better idea? If we had something to dampen the blast, then that would be a fine thing, but... Any branches we might find would just add to the shrapnel. I think I can get him clear. Sergeant Walker, if you would accompany me over here, we can deduce the blast radius. What are best chances are. Appears to be a slightly angled towards 11:00. This direction. A radius nearly five feet. Should have two to three seconds before it goes. Shall we? Seek out cover, Sergeant Walker. What are you going to do, sir? Here's what we're going to do, Mr. King. I am going to tackle you. You are going to stay absolutely still until you feel my body slamming into yours. Do you understand that? Pardon, sir? What did you say? Tackle you, King. It's our only option. I don't want to die, sir. But I don't want you to die either, sir. Maybe not. Just move on and I'll take care of this. Don't worry about it. None of us is going to die, King. I can do this. But I need you to let me do the work. Do you understand? If you move, you cost us precious milliseconds. Let me move you. You understand? Yes, sir. When are you going to do this, sir? I shall give you plenty of warning. Don't worry, Mr. King. Maybe it's not such a good idea, sir. I mean, we could always just cut the wire... You all right? Damn! Sorry, sir. It's my fault. I'm sorry. All right, that's enough, I'm alive. You're alive. This is not good. Shit. What's the diagnosis, man? Well, the good news is you've got a clean open wound. Probably some shrapnel tearing through. The bad news is this branch. Not much bleeding because it's an impalement. But could have lacerated your femoral artery. And you'd bleed to death internally. And how do we know that? You'll know. I'll just plug this hole. Stop the bleeding. And then if I dress this branch to stabilize it. Just do as little as you need to, Harris. We don't have much time. That's an order. It's good the house is not far off, sir. Quick as you can, man. Can you walk? Yes. I can try. Come on. This is it. How are you doing, sir? Still planning on surviving this bloody war. Are you sure this place is safe? I'm not sure about anything anymore, but what choice do we have? Let's go. Come in. Quickly. Quickly. Come on, sir. Come on. Easy, sir, easy. You quite all right, Mr. Harris? Yes, sir, just need... Let me help. I was a nurse. I worked at Clemenceau Hospital before it was bombed. You... you have a radio, yes? Oui. But it only hails frequencies from the Resistance. Well, I mean, is there any way that the Resistance can get in touch with the allies so they can let them know our whereabouts? It is possible. I can try. All right, Harris, you accompany our friend and see if you can achieve that. Because this did not hit an artery, we can remove it. And you know this how, from your time as a nurse? I shall get some boiling water. Sir? Thank you. I was just doing my job. No, no, it's much more than just doing your job saving my life. You're welcome, King. So, how's it going with the French Resistance there? No. It's, it's not like that. I'm sure it's not, sir. This was a good field dressing. I'll just leave her to tend to your wounds, sir. What? Nothing. He's just being an idiot. He's just a little boy who needs the love of a woman. Yeah. F13C, come in, over. Is F13C checked in yet? Negative, sir. Raise them. Yes, sir. Okay, this is going to hurt. I wish I had some whiskey or... I never touch the stuff. - No? Really? - Really. Why not? It's okay. It's... it's none of my business. My father was rather too fond of the stuff. Wasn't a great man. You're a great man. No. No, I'm just a soldier. No. You are so much more than that. I'm sorry. I... God, that hurt. I'm sorry. I thought it was better to take you by surprise. Well, you certainly did that. Dear God, that smarts. Okay, put pressure on there. Hold it. Thank you for trusting me. I'll say this for these Frenchmen: they make a damn good wine. I'm a beer man, myself. When in Rome. Drink up. You never know when you... Right. Have you really never been with a woman? Well, I mean I've kissed 'em. Lots of them. But, no, not all the way. You're missing out, mate. Well... To me, it's not just about sex. The more you have of a thing, the less special it becomes. At least to me. I've always wanted it to be with the right woman. Mate, they're all the right woman. Hey, to be honest with you, my first time I was head over heels in love. We were just kids with no idea what we were doing. But it was real. I can't imagine what I'm going to tell Mrs. Thomas. You are going to tell her that her man was a hero, and we wouldn't be here if he hadn't done what he did. And if you want, I'll go with you. Thank you. You're a good man, Mr. Walker. No. I'm not. But I'm trying. You have your moments. All it takes is one. One good one. You should wait for the right woman, King. F13C, this is 7, 8, Echo, Charlie, Papa. Come in, over. Again, F13C, this is 78ECP. Come in, over. There... there's no response, sir. - Keep scanning. - Yes, sir. F13C here. Are you there, Dunkirk? Repeat, F13C, are you there, Dunkirk? F13C here. Are you there, Dunkirk? Repeat, F13C here. Are you there, Dunkirk? F13C, come in. Keep searching. He may be using a different frequency. F13C here. Are you there, Dunkirk? We have a signal, sir. F13C here. Are you there, Dunkirk? F13C. This is Colonel Plummer. What is your sitrep? Repeat, what is your sitrep? We're at a safe house, outside the drop coordinates, approximately four miles northwest. Good to hear your voices, boys. What's your situation? We've lost Sgt. Thomas. Lieutenant Calloway is injured, but we have secured the package. We're being pursued by Jerrys, sir. We're possibly going to need air support. French Resistance have had a change of plans, so we... we may have been compromised. Where are you heading? We're heading to an airfield about two miles from the bridge. The package will be flown to mainland. Sir, we're going to have to pass through German-occupied area to get to the airfield. We may need support. I'll do my best to provide some air support. Pop some smoke so we know where you are. One more thing. What's that, Colonel? There should be a bridge a few kilometers down the main route. We have reason to believe there's a German patrol operating in that area. That would put a group of French freedom fighters in danger. I want you boys to blow that bridge. But with what, sir? Walker should have the explosives you boys need. Roger that. Out. Tell headquarters we should send men to the bridge and to the airstrip. We have more company. Quietly. That's gotta sting. Mr. Keller, do you drink? As much as I can, ma'am. This looks like it's going to be fine. I'll live. We'll all will. Do you see any more? Let's hide the bodies. Nein. Ja wohl. You talked to the Colonel? - Yes. - What does he say? I managed to give him our coordinates and then... We're out of time, sir. Why? What's... what's happening? We just killed two Nazis who were about to call in our position. - Damn it. - Can you walk? Doesn't look like I have much choice, does it? Come on, sir. Come on. That's it. All right. Merci. The airfield is 15 kilometers north. Merci. Merci beaucoup. So, yeah, thank you for what you are doing. The Nazis are coming. You cannot stay here, you know that. I know. I'm going to try and buy you some more time. Merci. Sir, are you sure you don't want any of that morphine? No, thank you, Harris. It dulls the senses. Yeah, but so does having a tree in your leg. Bonjour. No, no, no. It's a rather nice day for a stroll, isn't it? And where is our French little mouse strolling to? We can make this so much simpler if you just tell me where she is. Who? What girl? Bring him. No, no. Wait. Wait. I don't under... What is going... I love the smell of burning flesh. It reminds me of how, as a little boy, my father would roast a schwein on an open fire. Now, tell me where they are. I don't know what you're talking about. Now tell me everything or you will die. Okay, okay. Everything, I'll tell you. They are... heading into the village. Now, why would they be going into a village that is crawling with Germans? Ex... exactly. That is the last place you would expect to see them. Do I look, stupid to you? Honest answer? Oui. So be it. For your information, I know that the girl is trying to escape by plane from a small airfield. Not so stupid now, am I? Do you need to stop? Perhaps just for a moment. By my calculations, we are here, so it should be just beyond this next ridge. You're never gonna make it on that leg. That's at least another six miles. I'll manage. You may not have to. What do you mean? Well, shit. Take cover. You know, I could probably just pick him off from about a hundred yards with this rifle. You snipers are all the same. Trust me, mate, these blokes will piss their pants. Yes, well, we'll see about that, won't we? Be ready, here they come. Help! Help! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Please, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot me. Please, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, please. Hello, mates. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I can't believe that worked. What would you do if a big bald bastard tossed a grenade in your vehicle? Fair point. It's quiet. I don't like it. This should do the trick. Once we destroy it, that should slow them down. - Mr. Harris? - Sir? You stay and look out. Mr. King, Mr. Walker, would you kindly assist me in rigging? The pleasure would be mine, sir. Come along, King. You seem to like explosives today. How are we doing, gentlemen? Getting there, sir. Sergeant Walker? A few more moments, please. Very well. How's it going down there, chaps? Almost done. Make it quick. Is this the bridge? Here? The open space on the other side of this tree line has a hangar-like structure. It's got to be the way out. Sir, if I'm reading this map correctly, then the airfield should just be on the other side of this forest. - Where's Walker and King? - Just finishing up. They should be up momentarily. I hope so. Do you hear that? That doesn't sound good. Doesn't sound like a lot of fun. Mr. Walker? How are we doing down there? Almost there, sir. Well, hurry up! We have to go! - Start the car. - It won't start, sir. Quick as you can, man. It won't start, sir. It won't start. - Let's go! - It won't start. Drop your weapons and surrender. You have nowhere to go. It's a bloody tank. Damn it. This is your final warning. Drop your weapons and surrender. Damn, it's a ruddy tank! - We'll have to go on foot! - Let's go! Go, go, go! Fire! Did you really think that you could escape from me? We monitored your radio transmissions. Are we good? We're good. I do not understand how anyone could like such an inferior race. They're all like rats. Don't you know this? All they have ever done was lie, steal, and cheat. And you support them? Now, we could have easily slaughtered you Brits at Dunkirk. But we offered you a second chance, a chance to align with us. Let's just see if your Mr. Winston Churchill makes the right decision. If it were up to me, I would have killed every last one of you on that beach. But you will all die here today. Do you realize this? And I will decide how. And as for you, French, you disgust me! Now personally, I would love to kill you right here and now. But apparently... You have some information in that French little brain of yours. That is very valuable to us. Now, I will ask you one simple question and you will answer me. What is the algorithm? What is the algorithm!? Bitch. I will count down from five, and then you will tell me the algorithm. Okay. I will tell you! I will tell you. Don't tell him anything! Zwei. Eins. You go on ahead. I'll catch you up. Let me help you, sir. Fire! Cover and fire! Take cover! You all right, Mr. King? Yes, sir, just a nick. I'm fine. All right. Stay low. Stay low. We need to slow them down. You have nowhere to go! Surrender! More tension. More tension. Surrender and give us the girl and you will all go free. You will not escape. You will not get away. No one's going to surrender, Fritz. How we doing, lads? One minute. Surrender! Okay, we're so close. Ready, sir. You will not get out of there. Lay down covering fire and move on my three, two, one... fire! Shit. Move! Move! Move! Go, go, go. For King and country. I'm willing to bet Fritz is still coming. So let's go. Where is the plane? It's supposed to be here. No! You have nowhere to go! Surrender. Brother by my side, what do you want to do? I have one magazine left. No. No. Drop your weapons. Do it now! You are totally surrounded. Bloody hell, I'm not going out like this. - No! - Stand down, Sergeant Walker. It's our only chance. I'm sorry, Angelique. We did all we could. Please, no. Please, no. Please don't give up hope. It wasn't supposed to end like this. Fire. Look. Look! It's our boys. It's about bloody time. Schiesse. Schiesse. See, you never give up hope. We did it. God save the King. We did it. We did it! Let's get her to that plane. You took the words right out of my mouth. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry for your men. But thank you for my life. I just hope it was worth it, love. It is. Could you do us a favor? When you get back to London, find Emily Thomas. Give her this letter. I don't think I'll be around to give it to her. And I'd rather she got it sooner than later. Of course. Thank you. Let's get you on that plane. Are you all right? You? I'm alive. I don't know how, but I am. You must never give up hope. It doesn't matter how, it matters why. You are a special man, Lieutenant. You have a purpose. You must trust that. Thank you. Those men died heroes. Is there a better way to serve your country? None. What will you do now? Will I see you again? This war is far from over. I'll just have to enjoy the beauty this world has to offer. When one remembers to look beyond the ugliness. I'll see you in London. Now, let's get you on that plane. I think she likes you, sir. I don't know. Did you see the way she looked at me just now? There might be a real future there.
