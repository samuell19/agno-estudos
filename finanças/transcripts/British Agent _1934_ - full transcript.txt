Subtitles by Nostromo Gentlemen,from the Baltic to the Black sea ten million unequipped Russians are fighting a hopeless battle. The government is caught between a Czarist war or a Bolshevik peace Kolinoff is trying to whip back into the trenches... a starving army,weary of war and with one thought only in it's head To get out of it and eat and they are getting out Whole divisions are on the run It isn't easy,Sir,to offer advice to one's seniors,but I am speaking what I've seen That's what's you're here for,go on And I do believe unless decisive action is taken they may make a separate peace with Germany Oh,you've just given to extremes of confidence and despair Isn't that a needlessly pessimistic view,Mr Locke? Well,the thought of 50 German divisions being released from Russia and thrown against our allies on our Western front isn't a very cheerful one I think your trying money and intelligence military propaganda will have a steadying effect on the situation Well,I wish I would think so But you don't? What is your remedy? Recognize whatever government is in power Let Russia feel that Great Britain is behind her to the limit You know,Mr Locke,after reading a number of your Consular reports from Moscow I pictured you as an elderly gentleman with grey beard - I'm sorry,Sir. - Don't be sorry Pitt was Prime Minister at 24 Sir George and Lady Pendleton! Countess Marinoff! Lady Motrton! ?Hear,hear...! Change? What? I don't speak English Steve! - Stanley. - This is great -Well,I didn't know you were here -When did you pop in? This afternoon I'm way back to Moscow Had to deliver some official stuff to the old man Lady Carrister invited me to a ball or something You're perfectly right Well,it's not often we the consular servants get a chance to shake a leg at the embassy -What's going with you? - The same old thing. Under secretary -What's your new job? -Consular General - What? - Oh, yes. Pardon me the raw laughter, Steve, but you know I always said it would be a statue one day on Trafalgar Square. So the pigeons can build nests in my beard Going to support me while I do the polite? Oh,no thank you I've done all supporting I want to do Were you ever run over by an army truck? As bad as that I thought you looked a bit crushed -See you later -I'll be right over - Hello, Evans. - Good evening,Master Stephen. I beg you pardon Mr Locke. - Good to see you. - Thank you,Sir. If you'll excuse me saying so,you're growing Like a weed,eh? No, Sir, more like your father every day Ah,that's official responsibility I'm glad of your appointment,Sir pity your father couldn't live to see it Yes,he always enjoyed a good laugh,didn't he? Excuse me,Sir I'll announce you Mr Stephen Locke! Here comes the pessimistic Mr Locke So here you are So nice of you to ask me, Lady Carrister. Nonsense,we are delighted to have you,and how is England? Oh,much the same as usual Everybody complaining bitterly about the butter shortage while the Zeppelins dropping bombs on Regent Street. Regent Street? How nice and homely that sounds Oh, Katherine,dear Mr Locke My Lady Trehearne. - Play bridge? - Well,I,I do Meaning you don't That's another hope gone with As a penalty we shall make you dance Excuse me Well,here she is -You know her? -Only by repute In that case you may to prefer to meet the one at home I think I perhaps by better Mr Armitage, Mr Locke. - How do you do -How do you do Will you take Mr Locke to the library,please? Thank you,so much - This way,Mr Locke. - Thank you Lady Barrister Ah,Countess let me introduce you to Madame Cometh -Come around,this way,please -Oh,thanks Oh,no,Gentlemen We are only doing what you have done centuries ago but we are trying to do it better Without a Napoleon without a Cromwell. Aren't we getting away from the subject? You need not fear,gentlemen You may assure your respective governments... There will be no separate peace with Germany As I thought,most satisfactory Mr Kolinoff. That's sounds very gratifying coming from the head of the provisional government but What if your troops stop and call off the war without consulting you? Impossible.I have the troops completely under my control Maybe Right And you would be further gratified to know There will be no revolution It's now or never The fate of the allies is in the hands of Russia unless of course America sent a million men Any particular preference like having them all red headed or anything like that? Russia must have help,money and ammunition Without them,she cannot carry on I'm sure there will be no doubt of my getting them Pardon me,Monsieur So awkward of me I'm in a pickle I have partner in this dance,Miss Halfover Pardon me,gentlemen I'm sorry -I beg you pardon - Mr Stephen Locke, Sir Oh, my dear fellow,I've kept you waiting,now do forgive me Oh,it's so good to see you Thanks very much,Sir It's so nice to have you here,it's been ages Yes,it certainly has,hasn't it? Will you excuse us? It's rather vital,you understand -Certainly -Come on my dear fellow,come on I'm sorry to be so effusive diplomatic necessities -You'll understand? -Yes,of course,Sir Oh,by the way,who are you? Stephen Locke, Sir The new Consul General for Moscow I have some dispatches Oh,yes,yes,of course. Any trouble with submarines coming over? Well,Sir,in the North Sea Will you tell me tomorrow? All these guests Come and see me first thing in the morning Yes,Sir I'll hope you're enjoying yourselves I beg you pardon - I'll say, Locke,... -Hello Lady Carrister wants you to meet Madame Tomio Well,one is topic Thanks for the tip All right Too much Bobbie,I'm afraid you lose Yes I know,I had to dance Come in -Oh ,hello Steve! - Am I running in? Oh,no,not a bit. I want you to meet the other domestics Mr Bob Medill, an American Hello He keeps the cards,by the way -Monsieur LeFarge. -Enchantez,Monsieur - Mr Tito Del Val. - Welcome. Gentlemen, this is Stephen Locke. A brand new Consul General at Moscow - Don't let me interrupt your game - Do you now like to play? Sit down Take my place Go ahead,go ahead I have a duty to perform Keep your eye on that gum,will you Locke? As far as I know it's the last piece in Russia Oh,it's my deal by the way Times like these are a little bit difficult to concentrate on the game. Comrades - Look -Here they are Hold on,what now? I'll tell the orchestra to play something loud -And me with four aces - Too bad What a fine mess this is going to be! Hey,what's you doing? I say this is no time to stop, play something lively You see, Pommel won the derby 1915 with Donahue. Pommel was owned by Sully Joel,wasn't he? No, it was the Hultons. Oh, no, Hulton owned Fifinella. Riots are breaking out all over the city I am dead sure that coach was owned by Sally Joel They are the English for you They seem to be on the brink of the revolution and talk about horses races By the way, Mr Koniloff, Is this the situation you had so well on hand? Only stray bullets,nothing to worry about -Some drunken workmen I suppose -Yes -Excuse me,might be important -Certainly Pardon me,Sir Will you excuse me? Yes? Mr Kolinoff and his aides are leaving They have a car at the back door Deserting,eh? The Russian ship of state must be sinking Thank you,let's dance Please Please,ladies and gentlemen There is nothing to worry about No more than street fights, nothing has happened Nothing will happen Continue the music Hey,Cossack What are you doing here? This is the British Embassy you are not permitted here -You can come out now - Thank you I'm quite sure you saved my life - Are you hurt? - No. You can hardly blame him,after all you did take a pot at him - He deserved it. - He got it -I'd better go - Wait I'm trespassing on British territory too You can't go out there until this blows over This isn't just a street riot, it's the revolution The people have found their voice at last. Tomorrow the red government will be in power And the day after that,the blue and then the white and so on I suppose Perhaps you don't know a great deal about it No,perhaps not,but I'm trying to You couldn't understand Haven't you better go in before you catch pneumonia? Well,I risked the cold But I should go back before the guests start departing through windows and up chimneys Yes,I'd better get away while I can Well,come along All clear Thanks,good night Good luck Where is the Cossack guard? Deserted,Sir,every man Evans, open the door -No one likes to be kept waiting -Yes,Sir Ladies and gentlemen,it will be much safer for you in the ball room Will you please go there,please Who are you? I represent the Soviet government, we've just come into power What do you want? Kolinoff. Mr Kolinoff is not here You are sure of that? Quite I beg you pardon You'll probably find him at the Winter Palace I will.Thank you I'm sorry to have frightened your guests And now,ladies and gentlemen, you may go on with your dancing If you feel like it Comrades! Gentlemen,the position is this Since your recall with the Embassy Staff we've had absolutely no contact with the Russian government How could you? There is none We can't recognize the Bolshevik government None the less we must establish a contact to keep them fighting on the Eastern front In my humble opinion,someone must be sent to Petrograd Yes,but who? This Stephen Locke,you left him in the embassy? I had to leave someone,he is good as any Better than most,I imagine Well,gentlemen,we'll have to make due with Stephen Locke I'll open Three -Well,I will be a champ -Chump,sucker Pardon, I always mix in my wrong direction Say ,you're improving,another six months we won't be able to understand you at all I'll see you,but I'm a fool to do it -Three aces - A mere trifle,two pairs. oh,jack Sometimes I wonder maybe they didn't leave me behind to be the full support of your boys Say,by the way,why did they leave you fellows behind? I'm waiting to be told Somebody have to view the passports Yes,but I don't know whose? - Port or rum with it,Sir - Two pinches I'll have mine speckled Must you chew your blasted gum like that? Remind me not to forget it when I go,will you? I'm sorry, Bob. Charge off your nerves, Steve. Enough to get on a man's nerves sitting here day after day doing nothing They even let old ladies nit socks Tea,Sir? They've been going by for days Russian soldiers back from the front And everyone that leaves means one more German released against the Allies And all I can do stand in a window and watch them go by They also serve who only stand and wait Wait Wait for what? -My tea,I suppose - Yes,Sir Thank you, Evans. He's feeling pretty low How about going to that Gypsy Cafe? Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Here,here,have a drink. Spasiba Or I don't worry that she can't possibly be a good girl Please don't let your eyes water Will you drink a charochka with me,Englishman? If it is anything like vodka.I'm afraid not A charochka is not a drink,it is a song Drink a song? Aren't you asking me to be a bit whimsical? Look take this wine Now I sing the charochka and you must drink every drop down Sounds a cure for hiccups Well,good evening Look,the Englishman who was so kind to me - I see you survived - Thanks to you Comrade Pavlov, Mr,Mr? Mr Locke How do you know,Sir I can't seem to remember where we met We haven't met It sounds like a paradox Well,I'm acquainted with more people than are acquainted with me -Won't you join us? - Thank you I'm with some others I'll be with you in a minute, Sergej I thought you'd gone back to England No,the Embassy left in such a hurry,they forgot all about me Iv?n... Aren't we being a bit antisocial? Hey, Bobbie, did you see with whom that girl came in? -Pavlov -Who is he? The head of the Checa, Russia secret police A real rabid dog Well,drink a glass of wine before you go. Celebration of -Celebration of? -Let me see,what's the day today? - Tuesday - It's celebration of Tuesday For Tuesday and Russia Well,Tuesday anyway Isn't it a mistake to mix friendship with politics? Perhaps -You come here often? -Every night I sit in the Embassy all day and here all night I'm very busy man - Haven't you anything to do? - Not a thing except watch our Russian allies make a separate peace without making a single move to prevent it Why should you interfere? I am a servant of my country Then it's best you would be the first to know there will be no more war when one minds their own business And abandon their friends? If England had starved in the trenches as Russia has and fought with strength until they stalled us I would like to know what she'd do Shall I tell you? To go on fighting,for humanity. We did not want this war but now when we are in it,we are going through with it to the bitter end We just don't speak the same language,do we? Anyway,while you sit here talking your ideals I'll fight for mine Yes I was wondering when I was going to get a white feather Would you like to pin it in my coat? I didn't mean quite that But you are right.After all,what do I do? Visas in a few passports play poker, drink, listen to a girl singing,sit,sit sit You're a funny man Who one of your importance talk like that Perhaps I was little indiscreet It isn't much fun to watch a game and not take part in it I'm getting sick of the smell in this place Let's get outside and get some air Don't you think I've been impolite enough already? Why bother about them, they are having a good time Just hurry,I don't want to have to explain Well,here we are,won't you step in? Is this yours? What difference does it make? In this red millennium of yours everything belongs to everybody,doesn't it? Well,isn't that lovely? I thought you wanted to go some place? Where it is to go? You can't get out of Russia You know if I had a job in a country I didn't like,you know what I do? Go home? But if you had a job in a country you did like and you wanted to help it but your hands were tied What would you do then? I would be awfully glad my hands were tied but I wouldn't meddle in other's business Oh,dear,are we starting that again? - You started it - Let's talk about something else - What for instance? - Well,for instance.. The moon - I don't think so - Stars - No. - Music No. Us No. Yes You do awfully well for a man whose hands are tied I do even better for a man who has only known you an hour Do you redo as well? To be quite frank with you I'm about a week ahead of myself Really? Well,but I'll see you next Tuesday,what are you doing? - Catching up with next Tuesday - You are mad! Completely Send the bill to Maximilian's Street I hate to think of the bill you are going to get for that sleigh ride -With my salary? - There you are Thank you Good Brazilian Home used to ground tour own It's better like that The whole bean hold the flavour longer Yes it does Nice and warm in here,isn't it? You know if I was a sculptor,I'll model the head of you,and call it the Joan of Arc You have that kind of beauty I'll model you standing No I wouldn't either To think of you as Joan of Arc is to think of losing you as a martyr And I'd rather keep you as a woman -And I -Yes? Where on earth had I put my pipe? Funny place to keep your tobacco -What is it? -It's a cup How nice Presumed to be silver. I strongly suspect tin - Where did you get it - I won it at Oxford running faster than some other chaps,that's the college up there Really? A beautiful place,isn't it? Not so many years ago I was there,take it all very seriously I thought that Oxford was the world and that all of life could be learned from books Even now I get quite sentimental about it You can't help thinking about the past I suppose any more than I can't help being sad at Easter When I think of the services at our little chapel at home Just like Christmas All the peasants used to come in from out of the fields Bringing gifts But there were those peasant faces that convinced me Drawn,tired driven like oxen . We lived off their work,there was only one day a year they had enough to eat I was glad we lost our home That means those peasants are free Well Now that we had run the red flag at the top of the mast. -Let's forget about it -I can't forget it Not even if Even if? Stephen,... I'm afraid Of me? - Of us -Of regrets? Yes But you can't let your political opinions come between us Stephen,... Our lives leave in opposite direction away from each other Isn't it much easier to.. say good bye tonight? No,it isn't. I love you, Elena. You know what we are going to today? What? We are going to take a sleigh and drive far out into the country and we are going to lunch at a little inn And hours later we'll drive back in the moonlight Shall we? I can't, Stephen. I thought you were going to spend the day with me I had it all planned I have to work and so do you Work? The only work I have is to sit here till the end of the war reading all about it in old copies of the London "Times". Sitting and vigorously doing nothing while the Russian revolution No politics I am sorry I won't forget again What's that? Can't be anything important, the rent is paid Oh, hello, Evans. Beg you pardon for disturbing you, Sir,but I thought this might be important Foreign Office Well,I'm glad they know my address Probably Sir Walter wants me to change the water in the gold fish bowl. I've thrown them out, Sir You don't mean to tell me you actually had goldfish Yes I have numbered him for 17 years. Ah,God Heavens and you threw them out? I couldn't stand their stupid faces any longer,Sir Well,I suppose under the Red Flag... gold fish are a bit capitalistic You'd better wait, Evans. I have to decode these they may require an answer. Very good,Sir "for your" "...private information." "You are..." "...instructed..." "...to act..." "...as..." "..unofficial... representative..." "...in Russia." Unofficial representative in Russia,what does that mean? Anyhow it means you've been appointed Let see what it says Listen "We look to you to do all in your power "...to prevent signing of a separate peace with Germany" "This does not convey recognition of Russia" "...but commissions you to act only as an individual" "We cannot be responsible for your safety" "...or your decisions..." "..but we wait your recommendations" At last This is the biggest diplomatic mission of the whole war To keep the Russians fighting on the Eastern front It is a bit risky,Sir unofficial But it is work Something to do at last! Evans, how do you think I'll find the ambassadorial bed Roomy, Sir. A bit large but comfortable - How do you know? - You see Quite all right,don't apologize After all,Kolinoff slept in the Czar's bed Come on let's clear out these drawers, we are moving over to the Embassy Your clothes,Sir? I'd better send a man over to get them No,I think not I'm keeping my apartment Your staff,Sir? You'd be rather short-handed Evans I have you! I hereby unofficially appoint you Lord High Keeper of the Keys Lord High Chancellor of the Bed Chamber, Lord High everything in other words,Poohbah Oh,go and get me those two suitcases I have to go now, Stephen. Oh, I am sorry,I've forgot You see,you were right, Elena. I have to work too. - And I. - Yes Good bye Yes,but.. when shall I see you again? Not when I want to,when I can - Hi, Steve! - Hello, Bob. What brings you amongst the bright bright Reds? Well,I am unofficial on official business Since when has Great Britain recognized Russia? She hasn't that's why I am unofficial Another word you is but you in Well, chiefly I ain't Restful place this,isn't it? Used to be a school for girls before .the Central Committee brought their beards in But I'm bearding their beards in the den You haven't got a chance today they are negotiating the peace That's exactly what I come to talk about -See you later, Bob. -I'll wait for you You'll probably be coming down these steps in a minute,twelve at a time And gentlemen,if you sign this peace... ...you'll lose one third of your territory and practically your entire navy It'll be the same kind of peace the German dictated to France in 1871. That peace ruined France and history will repeat itself All we ask is you keep on fighting against our common enemy. until we win victory Let me point out a more practical side of this question Wars end but trade goes on unceasingly The life blood of this new Russia must be commerce and that I can promise you English trade Further more Germany will never tolerate a communist state on her frontier Therefore,gentlemen,your terms of peace must seal the doom of those for whom you asked of the Soviet No,I'm not talking,I'm not talking politics I am also trying to talk common sense The allied faithful will never accept this new government of yours if you desert them in this crisis Neither will Germany Or in no matter what terms you frame this peace the victory will be Germany's And she will dictate the terms Unrecognised by the allies, by Germany by the whole world unsettled from within the Soviet cannot survive! Therefore,gentlemen,I plead with you Don't defeat your own purpose Do not sign this separate peace if you wish the Soviet to live! Comrades ...Mr Locke's comments with which I do not fully agree serve however to support my contention. that this signing of this separate peace would be disastrous Never the less an armed neutrality which would maintain our frontier without a terrible toll of bloodshed. would be an advantage. Mr Locke... has presented several tempting promises from England for which we must be grateful Not so grateful I think You promised us England's trade you promise us recognition On what authority? I represent England Not quite,Mr Locke. You represent England only unofficially Your purpose in coming here was to delay the making of a separate peace You spoke well but only expressed the opinion of one of England's many private citizens Quite obviously that you violated diplomatic ethics No,... It's only that Comrade Lenin's secretary seems to know something of your affairs Mr Locke, having served your purpose in delaying the separate peace for a few minutes we will excuse you You play poker,don't you? I used to when I lived in New York. Good then you'll understand me when I ask you to let me buy another stack of chips -on credit. -Credit? - Three weeks credit - Yes,what do you mean? Time to communicate with Downing street I'll tell my government in return for you not opening peace negotiations I'm promising you immediate help Mr Locke, your ways are not our ways British capital is almost as hateful to us as German military,Sir However,since the German danger exists we're prepared to risk our co-operation with the allies On our terms Well,what are they? - 50 millions sterling - Right - Munitions - Right Troops... at least five divisions Impossible,every available man is in the trenches We have not only every available man but women in the trenches All right,I'll ask for them 50 millions pounds five divisions,ammunitions Another thing we must be assured that England will do nothing to hinder the soviets during these three weeks I'll pledge England to that,Sir - Send your communication - Thank you Thank you We shall keep our promise,Mr Locke. Let us hope you will keep yours and those you've made for England England's integrity is fairly well known,Sir Remember three weeks! "I respectfully submit" No, no... "I respectfully advice." "...that English interference in Russia during these next three weeks" "will prove exceedingly harmful to Anglo-Russian relations. "...and would be considered by the Soviets..." "...as a breach of faith." "I have the Honour to be etc..etc.." -Code that Henderson,and send it at once -Yes,Sir - Come in, Evans. - Thank you,Sir I thought you might be tired,Sir, and needing Poohbah,... How long have you been a diplomat among diplomats? 32 years,Sir You must have seen a great deal of history in the making A bit,Sir And it was all done after long conferences by a lot of gentlemen with long titles,wasn't it? Well,that would be a lengthy description of it,yes Sir They spoke for England,didn't they? -And England backed up what they said? -Well, yes..Sir Poohbah I'm expecting England to back up what one unofficial consul general has said And if they don't I'm sunk I'll be the most vicious liar in Russia But they will,there's nothing else they can do And they'll do it.I know I was right I'm sure you were,Sir And most courageous - Poohbah, get me a droshky - Yes,Sir You are not going out,Sir? Yes I'm closing my flat -All right, Evans. - Yes,Sir Well,I'm sorry if I interrupted you while going through my papers I wasn't going through your papers -I just came to see you - What for? To ingratiate yourself again so that you can betray a further confidence? Is that as near as you can come to understanding? I can understand your patriotism making you a spy Even you believing for a night that you loved me But I don't see how you can treat them both so obviously than after be forgiven because of your idealism Stephen,... ..the day at the Central Committee ..we were two simple standing for different things I warned you last night Now you haven't the right to be angry We accept that there are problems, we got to face them... Not only politically but as you and I I'm afraid the Russian mind is a little too subtle for me Love demands loyalty and so does patriotism You betrayed our love today. just with you Russians let down your friends Stop Stephen! Haven't you said enough? I've scarcely begun Traitors can't be trusted any more among nations than among individuals What you are trying to do here can only end in chaos, and disaster even if you succeed It will succeed,don't you understand? We can't go on sharing the burden of England's war England's war? We are fighting for the world England's war not ours Anyway we are fighting while Russians throw down their guns and run like frightened dogs I'm sorry Oh, Elena,... Why do I say these things to you when I love you so much? Because you are clever,Stephen but not clever enough Weak,but not weak enough Strong,but not strong enough - Good evening,Sir - Good evening Hello, Avery. I have to see the old man about these You can't get in now,Sir,he is trying to get through with that Russian business Yes I know Just imagine 50 million sterling Ammunition Five divisions,Locke is insane -I bet you he'll be paid - I bet we don't Sit down old man,I'll get you in as soon as I possible can All right.Thanks -Oh, Avery. -Yes Something must be done - What is it Evans? - Mail,Sir - Anything from England? - Nothing important I'm afraid Two weeks not a single word You still have another week,Sir If only I get one day in London -I know I could convince them. -I'm sure you could -Good day,Madam - I must see Mr Locke at once - But - It's vital - Very well,Madam - Thank you Thank you - Elena... - Hello, Stephen. Well,it's the first time you visited me in my official quarters Elegant aren't they Come and sit down I suppose it's too early to offer you a drink I shouldn't have come here, Stephen, but I had to - Something important? - Yes - Well? - I want to tell you not the Checa. What are you talking about? British troops under General Poole landed at Archangel last night So that's the answer to my telegram.I have won No,Stephen,no.You've lost What do you mean? They've come to fight against the Soviets But they can't,I'd promised It's true though The Checa just received the telegram. I came here as quickly as I could even though I shouldn't have Then -England -Has failed you Oh,my darling They humiliated you for the entire world,hasn't they? And finished your career My career,that's a small matter England hasn't let me down I let her down.Yes,that's it. I let her down. I knew those promises I made was impossible I just wanted to delay the separate peace ,that's all I... I never even sent that telegram Well,haven't you'd better go, you'll get into trouble being here Stephen,... The government move to Moscow tomorrow,naturally I'll go with them That means good bye Oh no it doesn't,I am not going to give you up Oh, Stephen,don't you understand? It just can't be.We can't be Look,keep what we got Whole and complete and beautiful You'll be glad when you go back to England I'm not going back to England and this isn't good bye You'll see me again, Elena. - How do you mean? - Yes and so will your government I'm not bound any longer The Soviet wants peace,does it? Well,they have to fight for it harder than they ever fought in war Poor Stephen,... Don't you see you can't win? And I couldn't bear to see you hurt any more That's why we mustn't see each other again Good bye Au revoir Promise... promise. Yes,promise So you've had no word from your government? Well,I have While you were trying to throw dust in my eyes .your government landed troops at Archangel I assure you, Sir, the responsibility for the misunderstanding is mine. not England's And I assure you that from now on there will be no occasion for misunderstanding .either with you or the government, do I make myself clear? Perfectly clear Well, Poohbah, Moscow is not as long way from home No,Sir. If the weather had been finer, we'd have seen the war in China Yes,if it wasn't for the houses in between Well, Poohbah, make yourself at home. This is it At least this it until the Cheka wants to know what the blazes what I'm doing in Moscow By the way, Sir,what are you doing here? Well,I am not absolutely certain. Except that the soviet government is here.. and I had an idea that they could be coaxed,wheeled or painted back into the war That's must be the font door bell - That was a tinkling sound? - What does it mean? I don't know,unless it means that somebody wants to be let in Shouldn't be surprised if you were right Good day,gentlemen - Well,well...My Goodness - Hello Hello, Stephen. - How long have you chaps been here? - About a week, Steve. That's grand,come along,sit down.I'll get Evans to bring us up a drink Don't bother,we are not in a hurry Go and get them a drink, Evans. Come along,sit down. Let's hear the news. Have a cigarette? What's the matter? Something happened? I suppose you know they have assassinated the Czar Yes I know,horrible An attempt has been made to reorganize the White Army - ?By whom? - A Lettish officer, Zvoboda. He has control over all the cadets here in Moscow. He has been in contact with Kormulof in the north and Shuben at Kiev. United they have a fighting chance to overthrow the soviet Wait a minute,we got to be very careful not to compromise our position What's got to do with you? I've already asked my government for 5 million franc So did I,the three of us have the greatest opportunity I'll never be able to get permission to do it But you could do it as private citizen Technically that is all you are You were unofficially appointed to prevent the signing of a separate peace Now it is signed,you have no orders and no responsibility You are free to act for your country's as you see fit With Kormulov's army and the white troops of Kiev... We might be able to -Can I speak with this Lettish officer? - We have already arranged it He and 17 million spiders have cosy net in a garret It's the only place in Moscow who hasn't a spy's ear in the keyhole Where is it? Mirov Prospect, 26. Listen fellows,be careful when you are smoking This place looks awfully sensitive Well,let's get down to business It's taken me two months to collect this equipment You see Mr Locke, I am secretly in command of the Moscow cadets The soviets is not yet well enough organized. to withstand a military attack You are not suggesting with a small group of young men could defeat the Soviets? - No. However,if those cadets could unite with Kormulow's army in the north and with Shuben in the South those three force should be able to overthrow the government in Moscow which is the vortex of the soviets Then when we succeed in that we can contact General Poole in Archangel I see Then I take it that one of the aims of your counter revolution ..is to put Russia back into the war? - Precisely Well,you have troops,you've arms, ammunition What do you want of me,Colonel? We have a certain amount of arms and ammunition,yes. But if we are to reunite with Kormulov and Shuben we need more And to get them we need money These men have given me a great deal of financial assistance already but it is not sufficient Unfortunately Great Britain will never subscribe to the overthrow of any government Besides the funds left here are not in my command but you could use them If they succeed,Stephen,think what it means It's the only way to win our point,fight for it Come on, Steve, take a chance Pretty long one If I do it ,it must be entirely on my own Yes if it means the overthrow of the Soviets is it not worth it? I suppose it is All right I'll risk it. You'll get your money tomorrow Where were you on the night of 27th? I can't remember You are not telling the truth .What paid you?You are working for Locke! No, no. I am not Better tell the truth Was it the British Consul General Locke? I do not know anything about it,I tell you. Was it? Come on Was it? Take him away I am sorry it is 830 but I was transcribing Lenin's notes That's all right,you look tired,Elena. A little I want to have a talk with you,sit down Thanks You're working too hard But I want to,if someone didn't take care of details Lenin would be swamped You know sometimes I look at him It is not only respect that I feel it's reverence When you follow a man like that,Elena You must give up all personal emotions Everything must be sacrificed for the new Russia You know that Yes,I know that That's makes it easier for me But I don't understand This Englishman, Locke,... Yes We have reasons to believe that he is supporting the White revolt - Are you sure of that? - He's been credited with it Besides,what else is he doing in Moscow - Well. - Yes,I know It has been enough to talk about it What you need is a scapegoat I need sufficient evidence to arrest him And you must help me to get it What can I do about it? You are familiar enough with Locke's habits to present yourself to a certain Lettish Officer named Zvoboda He can usually be found in Caf? Streilna. I want you to give him a cheque and tell him it is from Locke demand the receipt in full for all money received by him from Locke If the receipt is over the amount of the cheque it will prove that Locke has contributed other money Your knowledge of Locke and the gift of the cheque should be sufficient to convince Zvoboda that you are an accomplice of Locke's and I'll have my evidence I'll give you the cheque. - I can't do it, Sergei. - You must You realize that if he is arrested now he will only be deported Later...... he will be shot! You see,you have no choice I see - From Kromuloff. - OK What is it? Wait Looks like bad news It is: "Kromuloff can't get through." "The whole district has gone over to the soviets" Dogs! From Kiev! Well? "Shuben's army deserted," "they've joined the Bolsheviks" Well,everything is working out just lovely -What are we going to do? - Don't get so excited There is nothing else to do but wait - Wait? Wait for what? - Take it easy Wait till Tito got in touch with Col Zvoboda There maybe an explanation to all this -It's Tito - I'll go. Well? Did you find Zvoboda? No. He already left the Cafe Streilina when I arrived I've looked everywhere but I can't find him Disappeared Oh,that's that Now what do we do? I don't know,I don't know Perhaps You'd better get some sleep, you are on the verge of talking to yourself There is an old American proverb... "when you are behind the eight ball, there is nothing else to do but sit down on your own.....dead box and wait for the brakes" Good Evening,Sir -I beg you pardon,Sir.. - Thank you, Evans. I ought to tell you,Sir,that Elena! I am so glad This is the first nice thing happened today -Been waiting long? - About half an hour I so wanted you to be here You see I need you I'm licked, Elena. Everything that stood between us is gone now I have no duty,no obligation to anybody or anything. Yes, Stephen. You have an obligation to me That's why I came here to talk to you about I want you to leave Russia - Leave Russia? - Yes,now,tonight As you say there is nothing to hold you now There's us No, I still have work to do Your work is done That's why you must go I don't follow you Stephen, if you go now you can save your dignity Tomorrow they'll send you out of the country. - They couldn't do that - They will do that - They have no reasons - They have every reason You have been supplying money for the White Army to fight against the soviets All right.They can't prove that They'll have the evidence tomorrow morning Oh, Stephen,if you love me you leave tonight! You are asking me to sneak out No, Elena, I can't do that I can't do that. Stephen,I.. I have never asked you to sacrifice your ideals I've didn't have the right to do that But your pride,then I have the right to ask the woman who loves you Leave Moscow tonight! No. - You do love me,don't you? - You needn't ask that Oh, then believe me, Stephen, when I tell you that.. If you go tonight there is some chance for us when all this is over I promise you if you stay, tomorrow our love would be dead What is all this? I can't tell you What have you done to me now? -Tell me -Please, Stephen. Elena,you've got to tell me! All right You are to be deported tomorrow on evidence that I got by representing myself as your agent I see It was all there from the beginning This is the end,what's the use of talking about the beginning Well,go on,run along and do your duty Yes Perhaps you'd better wait a moment It wouldn't do for anyone to think you were mixing business with pleasure -Hello, Stephen. - Well,what is it? - Do you know what happened? - No. Lenin.He's been shot - Dead? - Reported that he is dying There's a rumour that you have something to do with it - I? - It's part what they call the Locke plot. Never mind what they call it Do you realize what this means, Steve? - Yes,one more chance for us,eh? - You bet it is With Lenin out of his way,the Soviet has no leader,the red government will crack up -Now -Wait a moment -Well,what's up your sleeve? -This is it Through the cadets, there is a chance to reorganize the scattered white sympathizers The four of us could go to a counter revolution I don't think we dare to go any further with this thing We need to get to help one another, we got to make up our minds now We must take advantage of the situation,surely you understand that,Steve? -It's our last chance - I don't know,I don't know I So much has happened you must give me time to think. I'll tell you what You fellows go back to the garret,I'll join you later All right,come on Very critical Camphor oil 5 grams every two hours Lenin is fighting for his life So is the soviet There are many plots,traitors,schemes Arrest all suspects. Remember we have no time to give them a trial There must be no riots. The only way to suppress riots is with machine-guns. Call it terror if you like but those are your orders Have you the evidence? Lenin is dying If we work quickly we may be able to save everything for which he has worked Have you the evidence? I thought so Do you know what it means? Where is he? I don't know I have sufficient evidence to arrest Locke. I want him found.Try the Consulate first If he isn't there look for him Keep on looking until you find him even if you have to tear the city to pieces to do it "Condition unchanged." If he dies. You have no right here. This is British territory - Wonder why he doesn't answer - He's got plenty to wonder about I wonder why we have any cadets, I wonder where Medill is, I wonder how There he is now Hello,Bob,close the door Any news? - Too much - What is it? - Whole town upside down - What's the matter - Plenty - Well Listen, Steve. I've got some news which is going to be pretty hard for you to take Yes? I've just come back what's left of your Consulate The whole place is shot to pieces. and everything in it Evans? Poor old Poohbah! Also they are looking for you in the most unpleasant manner Yes,I know .They have plenty of evidence against me too How did they get it? Well,you see.. Because I was a fool I suppose Anyway they got it,it means I've put you fellows in a nice hole Listen there is only one hole they can put you in and not get out If you are in there,it doesn't matter anyway,so forget it Wait a minute -The headquarter of the cadets - Go ahead OK "it is imperative,we see you." "...at once" "We have important information." "We are... waiting..." - What's wrong with it? - Something has happened -Line is dead -What does it mean? One of two things Either woodpecker ate the pole or the reds cut the wires Anyway it's the deadest line since I tried to get a number in a Philadelphia phone boot We'd better try the Regiment in person That's a good idea,I'll go, anyway I want some cigarettes - I'll go with you - Oh,no you don't Don't be silly. It's the only place in town they are not looking for you - Yes,perhaps you are right - Of course I am right How long are you going to be? Well,I don't know,it's pretty far probably won't be back before 2 30 or 3. Listen, if you don't get through, the next best thing is to find Zvoboda. Well,I'll do my best,right Hey, Stephen, come here I think I have a good plan Look I'll show you You see here is the road to the south gate,hold it I thought we were going to play poker. Well,Colonel Zvoboda,you have to give me credit,I finally found you What's the time? - 6 30 - 6 30 Imagine that frog,this time ...he could have been with the cadets and back four times. Look out for that cigarette! Do you want to blow the whole place up? That's one way of getting out of this attic No,maybe it is not LeFarge's fault As well whose fault it is, we are in a nice fix Zvoboda disappears and leaves us sitting here in the middle of his ammunitions dump And now that confounded Frenchman... Hey,you don't suppose he could have found Zwoboda,do you? If he had we would have heard about it,wouldn't we? We would have unless Well,there is only one way of knowing Go to the Cadets and see if he has been there or not It won't take me long Now don't you go and getting yourself lost and be a notion. If it wasn't so down serious that'll be funny -I'll buy something to eat. -I'll be back soon - Tito... - Yes Look here Well,don't be a fool,will you? That's for you,I'll be back soon What's you've been doing? Cheating? Murderers - Stop that you fool! - Let me out You can't shoot,you can't Don't you understand? They locate the rifles,the ammunition,everything. I suppose you're right Well,it's going to be a long time before we want to play poker again Look here where are you going? Cadet Head Quarters I'm a bit tired of this approach in the garret doing nothing We came here to start something,didn't we? -Well I'm going to start - No,no take it easy Take it easy,we'll do it together - I get through better alone. - No, Bob, don't go out like this Keep your head now What the sense on our doing the heroic and making a Roman holiday of ourselves? We'll get to the cadets,all right,I'm going with you come along,sit down here I am going to get ready You know we are going to be pretty careful how we move now When we found out some about the situation We could arrange the transfer of ammunition soon rather than have coming here in small groups to fit it You know it is pretty dangerous to mobilize a group as big as that Come on,come and stick your head in this cold water now,it'll do you good Where is Locke? Tell me.Where is he? Aren't you getting a little tired of this? You've been on it three hours now Of course I don't know why I should complain,you're doing all the work You admit that you know him - Who? - Locke, you fool Seems to me I do,a nice old gentleman with a long white beard,isn't he? You are going to be shot tomorrow morning And buried in quicklime with 50 others Don't apologize,you know how democratic we Americans are Tell me where he is and you can walk out of Kremlin now,free Look, Pavlov,... if you want to find Locke you can start bring a dog out to the nation for him because I'm not going to tell you,that goes for now and tomorrow morning - Where is he? - China. - Where is he? - Brooklyn. Take him away Well,gentlemen,I hope you are satisfied You made me swallow the last piece of gum in Russia Let's go - Here is the papers you asked for - Thank you - Do you know Medill? - Of course He is a courageous man,he won't tell He is the only one left who knows where Locke is hiding Elena,our government is in the balance If Lenin dies,and if these riots continue,it will fall The riots must be stopped Locke is one of the sources, he must be found Why it is necessary to run down one lone man when there are so many? We can no longer think of the present and of ourselves,Elena We must think of the future and thousands of Russians yet to come This is what you must do: Go to Medill,he knows you love Locke Gain his confidence,find out from him where Locke is - Haven't I done enough? - No None of us has done enough until Soviet is firmly established - But I love him - More than Russia? More then the future of millions of people? Oh,what is all worth all this flag-waving and preaching about right and wrong? Where did it get you? Nonsense Find out where Locke is, that is your only duty - Well - I'm sorry, Medill. Don't be sorry,it's merely a stop over,I'm leaving tomorrow Look,you'll be shot in the morning It was mentioned in the conversation Well,what can I do for you? I came here to find out where Stephen is I'll tell you that tomorrow about noon If we have to have jojo here it's make me itch to look at him Wait outside Medill,where is he? Probably playing solitaire You know we used to be four of us, it wasn't bad then,we could to play poker And now with the rest of us,almost gone I can get him out of the country You are rather fond of him,aren't you? I love him You didn't come here as a spy,did you? No woman could be that rotten,could she? No,no woman could be that rotten All right than I'll tell you. And when you see him tell him I've been deported not I will Well,then you'll find him In the garret of a two decked stores in Nirov Prospekt 26 I'll send a squad He isn't there now,he won't be until 9 o'clock It's 8 now The place is full with ammunition And the only way is to blow it up. Yes,that's what I thought The barracks! Tunev! At 9 o'clock this evening you are to bomb two vacant stores at Nirov Prospekt 26 I want them razed.Keep your men clear the place is filled with ammunition At least he'll never know No,you'll never know Bob! You? Yes, Stephen. Who told you to get here? Where did you learn that knock? - Medill told me. - Where is he? - Deported. - LeFarge? Medill, Tito, LeFarge,... Even Evans. You've got us all,haven't you? Oh,come on let finish it up, send for the soldiers Or would you rather cry first? Stephen,close that door,please Against what? I want to be alone with you forever For ever,that's about 20 min for you isn't it? Well? What is it? Stephen,I've never lied to you,have I? Think back No, I don't think you ever have And it's the first time you ever heard me do and say anything to compromise I've been loyal to Russia,haven't I? You've been loyal to Russia all right You've ended everything for me because of that I haven't the courage to go on being a patriot or idealist any longer,Stephen I tried to but I am too much of a woman I wish I could believe that -It would change everything so much -Stephen, look at me Look at me And the you'll believe that I say I've done my duty by the Soviet and I am through There is only you and I now It doesn't matter,Elena You're all I've got I suppose we can get out of this mess somehow I suppose so Well,let's not talk about it any longer,I'm so happy to be here We might get across the Lettish border Pick up a train at the coast from there and we'll go to England together Yes we might You would love it, Elena. I know a quiet little village in Sussex Not dull just peaceful We'll get a cottage and a second hand motor to knock about in and take all the time in the world doing as just as we jolly will please Tell me more about our little village It's just a ridiculous little hamlet with one church spire There's a doctor, and a parsons, the village constable and the squire Each house has a fence and a garden And on Sundays the villagers are all file out in their best The mornings smell fresh and we just stand there in the sun And it'll be so quiet we could hear the breeze in the grass And from far away the sound of the church bells And then Stephen, don't let me go - We got to get out of here - We can't - We can try! -You haven't got a chance! - What? - Either of us - Then you came here knowing? - Oh, Stephen, don't ask me. Get hold of me closely forever Lenin has regained consciousness, Lenin he lives And his first words were: "Stop the terror." He says he's pardoned all the political prisoners Hey, Steve! Hey, Steve! Hey,Steve Don't forget to send me some gums Gums Gums Gums! Subtitles by Nostromo
