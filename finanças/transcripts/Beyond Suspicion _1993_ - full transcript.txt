( Light moaning ) ( Phone clanking ) ( Moaning continues ) You're incredible. That's my job. Oh, hey, kiddo, guess what ? What ? Tickets to the playoffs, box seats. I love you, dad ! I love you, dad ! How about that, turtle, pretty great, huh ? Did you strain the seeds out ? Twice. Joyce, do you mind doing me a favor ? I'm having trouble with my brakes today. I thought you just had them fixed. I did, I did, but they didn't do the job right, I don't have a spare minute, and the warranty already ran out. Oh, how long ? I don't know, about three months ago. Three months ? Come on, you know what to do, you just put on those heels, that little red dress, they'll be tripping over their tongues to help you. Morning. Hi, mom, got time for a quickie ? Do you have my check ? Don't I always take care of you ? Now, let's throw down some cards. I can keep them waiting another five minutes. ( Sighing ) What's the death card doing there again ? It doesn't mean you're gonna die. For god's sake, you should know that by now. That's never meant to be taken literally. It means that there's an ending. Is there an ending for you ? Actually, I was thinking about getting something started. Another business venture ? Mmm, looks like there's a great deal of money involved. Whoa, sorry ! Gloria, hi, it's Dr. Benderman, I just stepped in to make a phone call. Is this your husband ? Hi, Stan benderman, I'm Gloria's dentist. Oh, Brad Shaw. Well, congratulations, I heard you two just got married. And rumor has it, it was a whirlwind courtship. Yeah, we met doing laundry. If you two will excuse me. She loves big, fluffy towels with fabric softener. It's an obsession of hers. Well, congratulations. By the way, if you need any dental work, don't hesitate to call, I'm right around the corner. All right. Nice to meet you, buh-bye. Bye. ( Woman ) You have patients in one, two and three, and the waiting room is full. What do you want me to tell them ? I'll take care of it ! Good morning, being that we're running a little late today, and I know that your time is worth money too, I'm giving you all half off. I'll be right with you. We're not gonna make the rent this month. You're giving too many people a break. Silvia, those are my people, it's hard times out there. It's hard times in here ! I just got the bill from the lab, and they're charging US up the wazoo ! Son of a-- ( woman ) We're on in room one. Ah... Well, he'll do it, but it's a trade. He's got this cap. Babe, couldn't you have talked him down to a cleaning ? Well, it's a $300 job. Well, listen, you did the best you could, uh, I'm in a crunch here, I gotta go. Oh, by the way, I'm gonna be coming home a little late tonight, I gotta work with one of my projects, okay ? Okay. Okay, bye-bye, baby. Bye, hon, talk to you later. She insisted you see her, she's not on the waiting list. Okay, okay. ( Giggling ) I told you not to come here. I know, no one recognized me. Now, shut the door. I figured, uh, you must have wanted to see me pretty bad, or you wouldn't have pulled that little stunt. You told me where you were gonna be, I couldn't help myself. Oh ! ( Stan ) Oh, that's it, take it off, take it off, take it off ! We only have a couple of minutes. My friend who made it good. You know, it still burns Barbara up that she dated him too and you end up marrying him. Well, Barbara didn't get the nickname "thunder thighs" for nothin' ! Yeah, she didn't go to her appointments in black stockings, either. The man was staring at my legs. I just thought I'd put him out of his misery. Anyway, how else am I gonna meet a professional man ? Oh, doctor, I have such a toothache. Please, I think I need a filling ! Do you know that the very first time we ever made love, he insisted that we do it in the dentist's chair ? Ah... Now, just hold still, darling, this will only take a moment. ( Laughing ) So where is he tonight ? Ah, he's doing his charity work. He works with men who are down on their luck. Where does he find them ? I think this is an ex-con he found in a pool hall. I don't know if you wanna know this, but, um, there's another rumor going around. Better from your mouth than someone else's. One of the girls saw Stan with Gloria. Old news. It doesn't bother you ? Well, Stan's been a ladies' man for so long, I'll never live that down. Yeah, they're all jerks, anyway. At least your jerk has money. I know Stan's a handful, I mean, I knew that when I got into it, but I don't think anything's going on with Gloria. She just got married. Babe, you've gotta stay away from the office. No one recognized me ! Listen, Gloria, I am serious ! Brad's waiting for me. We are moving forward on this, now. We've got to be careful ! And I need you. Do you wanna do this or not ? Okay, okay. You're beautiful, you're my golden girl. Yeah, who laid the golden egg. ( Laughing hysterically ) Woo ! That's one thing you miss in prison, the wind in your face. How big was your cell ? Seven by nine. Woo, you'd get claustrophobia. Claustrophobia ? Claustrophobia... C-l-a-u... Okay, okay, claustrophobia, I've got it. "An abnormal dreed-- dread. "Dread of enclosed or narrow spaces." Good thing I didn't have that problem, huh ? You feel like a home-cooked meal ? Oh, yeah, a home-cooked meal would be great. Good, somebody was asking about you. Education is everything, Duke. Stan's teachers told him he wouldn't amount to anything. They thought he would wind up using his hands, like his father. I told him, "never mind them. You can read and you can study on your own !" What'd your husband do ? Railroad worker, he was a good man. Weak, not like his son at all. He lived in fear of breaking the law ! Wouldn't even jaywalk. You're never gonna get ahead, never get ahead, if you live by the rules ! Because this-- this system-- this system is designed to keep the little man down. Ouch ! Here you are, Duke. Did Joyce get the car fixed ? Well, she traded services, I'm gonna have to do a cap. Ah, she has no talent for persuasion. I'm working on that, she's come a long way ! She's a little hellcat from the projects, couldn't even annunciate properly. My son always marries women who aren't his equal. His first wife was white trash too. Pretty, but dumb, dumb as a stone. Slowness has an advantage. Everything they learn is spoon-fed by you. Excuse me, what's this ? That's a palm reading chart. You want your palm read, Duke ? No, no, sorry. I don't wanna know what's gonna happen. I mean, what if it's bad ? Well, my son knows he has troubles ahead, but he's armed with that knowledge. It gives him an advantage. In this life, you take any advantage that you can get, hmm. Gloria stopped by today. How's she holding up ? It's time to do something about her situation. First, we take care of the in-laws. Say the word. You're a good man, Duke, a good friend. What are you two whispering about ? Oh, just staying ahead of the game, mom, like you taught me. ( Phone ringing ) It's tonight, are you ready ? Uh-huh. You know what to do, don't you ? Of course. ( Thundering ) When this is all settled, I'm gonna do right by you. We're gonna be rich men, you and me, when this is done. ( Laughing ) Woo ! Woo ! ( Knocking ) ( Man ) I'll get it ! I'm sorry to disturb you at the dinner hour, Mr. Shaw. I'm will gans, from the farm bureau. Um, what can I help you with, Mr. Gans ? Do you mind if I come in ? Oh, please, by all means. We haven't made a mistake in our records, have we ? No, no mistake. Can we get you something to drink ? If you lie down on the floor very quietly, so I can tie your hands, I won't have to hurt you. We-- we won't give you any trouble. You can have anything in the house, anything you want. Lie on the floor, very quietly. You heard me ?! All the way ! ( Gunshots firing ) All right, Duke, Duke, Duke ! Get the kitchen, I'll get the living room, go ! ( Objects falling ) Go, go ! You'd beat him up for me ? Well, I did give a few black eyes in my day, but I had to be a fighter, and you don't. I don't wanna teach you that. You just listen to your daddy. He really knows how to handle people. He told me, if Kenny didn't leave me alone, his drill would slip the next time Kenny had a cavity. Oh, you know he didn't mean that. I know, but it's funny. Why didn't he come home from dinner tonight ? Well, you know your dad, a lot of people depend on him. I'm sure he's doing something very important. They laid right down for me. It was that easy. I was looking at my watch, it only took you a minute and a half ! Just wait until the will is probated, everything ends up in the golden girl's hands. Was he able to say anything ? He said there were two. Is that all he said ?! I mean, will he be able to tell US anything more ?! No, he's gone. ( Sobbing ) They're both gone. Oh, no ! ( Crying ) I just spoke to them this afternoon, and they were fine, oh my god ! Hi, Renata, it's Joyce. Uh, is Stan there ? Oh, well, I just thought maybe he stopped by. Okay, thanks, bye. It's an ozzie Smith ! You bet it is. You can take it to the next game. I can use it to catch fly balls ! That's my boy, you find the advantage, and you use it. Give me the ball, pop fly. It's for for you. Huh ? Good job ! Hello ? Yes, this is Dr. Benderman. I'm sorry to hear that, how much pain ? Uh, no, no, we'd better not let it wait. Uh, yes, about a half an hour. Right, right-o, I'll see you there. Buh-bye. I can't help it, it's an emergency. A kid got his tooth bashed in. Kiddo, we'll have to pick this up later, all right ? Okay. When will you be home ? I don't know, I'll have to see how serious it is. Uh, I'll call you ! How can you think of sex at a time like this ? Come on, don't tell me it doesn't turn you on, think of it. We've got a secret between US we're gonna take to our graves. Stan, I'm scared. You've been through this, I haven't. Relax, the cops think it was a burglary ring working the area, just like I planned, do just as I tell you, you'll never have to worry about money again. Hey-- I promised I'd take care of you, didn't I ? Look, I need you to get me through this. I know ! I know, I'm here, aren't I ? Yeah. Have you called the insurance company about another policy on Brad ? Yesterday. Oh, baby ! You're sure he's still the heir in his parents' will ? Of course, he is, they worshipped him. What about Joyce ? Now, are you buying insurance on her ? The boy needs his mother. Oh ! It's her time. Later, he won't need her so much, it'll be my time. How long am I gonna have to wait, Stan ?! What's the matter, Gloria ? You're getting tired of him already ? You know it's not easy ! The bastard's in love with me ! We'll do it as soon as we can. We just have to wait until the cops lose interest, and file this one away, okay ? Come here. ( Door opening ) ( Joyce ) How'd it go ? The patient will live. You know, Christopher's spending the night at Steven's tonight. Babe, look, I've had one hell of a day. I've gotta hit the sack. Hey, you all remember Joyce. She used to be one of US peons. I bet Barbara's eating her heart out. ( Joyce ) I thought i'd catch you on your break. Hey, hi, there, how you doing ? I was just headed downtown. Okay. What ? How's Bruce ? Well, he keeps telling me how miserable he is with his wife, but every night, guess who he goes home to ? So what are you doing downtown ? Well, Christopher's at his grandmother's house, so I thought I'd surprise Stan. I like to drop in from time to time. Just like old times, huh ? ( Laughing ) Hey, Silvia, you're getting off early ! Yeah, well, the boss told US to get lost. Oh, is he here ? I think he left a few minutes ago. No, I think he's up there with a patient. Ah ! Why don't you let me get him for you ? Oh, please, I know my way around, thank you. ( Light moaning ) Stan ! Stan ! Oh, honey, Joyce ! ( Car horns blaring ) ( Man ) Watch it ! ( Stan ) Hey, hey, hey ! You know that she's been after me for years ! She caught me at a weak moment ! It never happened before ! Oh, right, so the first time you do it just happens to be the same day I drop in ?! Joycie, joycie, my god, 70 to 80% of all married men slip at one point or another ! I can't believe I was so stupid to think that you could be faithful ! Joycie ! No ! That chair must have a lot of mileage on it ! Now, you're getting paranoid ! You humiliated me in front of Silvia ? She's my friend ! I told you it never happened before ! Oh, don't insult me ! You've been stringing me along for years ! Joyce ! You tell me people talk, but it doesn't mean anything ! Well, I'm sure everybody knows, and everybody thinks I'm an idiot ! Babe, babe, you're over the top, here ! I understand it's a shock, but we will pull through this ! Don't count on it. Joyce, oh come on ! Joyce ! She caught him doing it in the dental chair ! ( Laughing ) Oh... Ah, smoker's lungs. Boy, I sure thought you'd get more than this. Are you sure he doesn't have some of his money hidden somewhere ? Hey, how would I know ? I can't afford a decent lawyer, he made sure of that. Oh, bastard ! It's not fair that he took the house. He told me if I went for the house, he'd fight for sole custody. You know what I've been through ! I'm too tired to fight, I just wanna get out. You're being way too easy. Look, he can have whatever he wants, as long as he doesn't take my child away from me. Don't give me that look ! It's Christopher's birthday, what else could I do ? Anyway, I want him to see what he's missing. ( Stan ) You'll never believe it. Peg montez is suing me for bills I supposedly owe her. Yes ! ( Clapping ) Yeah, she was overcharging me. I've, uh, I've asked other dentists. I paid double for the same lab work. That's for me, that's for you. So does that affect my payments ? Oh, no, Joyce, god, no. I'm just making conversation here. Mmm ! Don't go, daddy, don't go. Now, you know I have to. I want you to go to bed, so I can go ahead and talk to your mother, okay ? Go ahead, good night. Joyce, this is no life. I can't stand seeing you living this way. You took the house, I'm doing the best I can. You know, my mother did our charts. She says we're gonna be together again. Do you believe that ? Yes. How is Renata ? Ah, she's been in and out of the doctors' offices. I think this whole thing has been a shock to her. I'm sorry to hear that. Joyce, I may have my faults, but you won't find anyone who loves you the way I do. Anyone who'll do the things I do for you. Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about. You must miss me at least in that regard. I think you'd better go. What are you doing ? Well, these are your bills, right ? You don't mind if I take care of them, do you ? Mom, I don't like my new school. I don't know anybody, nobody talks to me. Ah, it'll get better. Mom, are we gonna be okay ? We're gonna be just fine. It's just not gonna be as easy as it was. We never had problems before. Oh, yes, we did, we had lots of problems. They were just a different kind. Now, I'm gonna need your help, okay ? Okay. Christopher ? ( Stan ) We're in here. He's got a fever. Oh, honey, how do you feel ? Mommy, I'm cold. Oh, you've probably just got a little bug. You'll feel better soon. They called me at the office, they couldn't find you. It's a good thing Christopher's got his own key. It's past midnight. Please, don't make me go, I can't bear to leave him. Hi. Good morning. How're you feeling ? Better. You know, you had your dad and I a little worried. Dad ? Stan ? Hmm ? His fever's down. Ah... Hey, kiddo, huh ? What do you want for breakfast, huh ? Anything in the world. Stan, what's wrong ? My mom had a stroke. Is she all right ? I didn't get to the hospital in time. She died before I got there. I'm sorry. Pack your bags, Joyce, you're coming home. I'm not going back there again. I'm not so sure this was a good idea. I wasn't myself last night. I just felt so bad about your mom. Maybe we should forget this ever happened. Joyce, look at me. Look at me. I've already lost someone I love dearly. I couldn't bare losing you again. I want my family back. You just tell me what to do, I'll do it. I don't wanna get hurt again. If you wanna see me, we have to start all over again. No more sleeping with me. You can take me out on a date. If I hear of even a rumor of another woman, the deal's off. It's only you, I swear. It's only you, I swear. We've gone to second base, sweetheart. You ready to go all the way ? What do you think ? ( Stan ) The case is completely cold. Those piss-ant cops never had a clue ! They think the burglary ring working the area killed Brad's parents. Remember how I predicted it would play out ? I'm telling you, it's too easy. Brad's inheritance just came through. He signed the will making Gloria his sole heir. Hey, hey, hey, hey ! Hey, hey ! Not out here ! Duke, we are looking at a half a million bucks ! Yeah, well, what's our share ? We split a quarter mil, Gloria gets the rest, she deserves it. She's had a hard time. Two husbands who weren't worth a damn. We have to take care of women. Crime is the only way to get ahead, Duke. You'll never have anything if you live your life within the law ! All right, now, with this one, we'll do something completely different, a whole new m.O. They'll never be able to put two and two together. How's Gloria holding up ? She's not losing nerve, is she ? Who, the golden girl ? Not her ! She's a rock ! Don't you worry about her ! She does exactly what I tell her. Let's go. You're never gonna touch her again. ( Gunshots firing ) Gloria, the towels. Here, just help me wipe this blood up. Duke, come on, help me get him to the car. Just put that bag over his head ! What did he expect me to do ? This is a man who carried a lunch in a pail to work every day ! I mean, could he possibly think this is what I wanted for the rest of my life ? No, babe, you deserve a whole lot more. Okay, now, you know what to do. You wait a while, then-- okay, I know. I call the refiner, and I ask if he's working late. You're a concerned housewife, you just wanna know. We'll wait a couple of hours, you start to call the hospitals ! I've got the numbers inside. Good, good, finally, in the morning, the police, space out the calls. I'm getting increasingly more worried with each phone call. I've got it. Good. Okay. I've got it. Now, when will I see you again ? We've gotta stay away from each other. If you have to call, if it's an emergency, use a pay phone. Duke, get your car. Relax, babe, relax, you know me. I can plan things. You just stand back. Now, I want you to hose down that garage. Okay... ( Tires screeching ) Now, this place makes me nervous. A guy could get killed around here. It's a sewer ! It's a stink hole. You could throw a body down here in broad daylight, in front of 20 people, nobody would even see it. What are those for ? To make it look like a robbery. A sex killing and so forth. Take this, take this. The cops will think he got rolled by a hooker, and killed by her pimp. Condoms in the pocket, body found on the east side, what else would they think ? It goes on all the time down here. Half a million bucks, Duke. ( Stan ) The beauty of it is, he was an average working class man from an average working class family. Nobody will even care enough to ask any questions. ( Cat meowing ) ( Gasping ) What are you doing here ? Relax, relax. I need you, I had to see you. How'd you get in ? I made a key. I smell perfume. What's the matter, Gloria kick you out of bed ? No, no, no, no, honey, that's not it. Don't touch me. Listen, listen to me. I need you, I want you, I had to see you. It isn't another woman. Then, what is it ? I killed a man. I don't believe you. Oh, come on, doesn't it turn you on, just a little ? No. No. If you ever tell anyone, you're dead too. Even if I'm in jail, I will hunt you down, and I will find someone to kill you. You don't wanna die, do you, Joyce ? ( Man ) This stuff doesn't look like it came from a hooker's den. ( Man ) What's the problem ? It's been treated with fabric softener. So hookers can't use fabric softener ? Since when ? ( Stan humming ) Hey, joycie, I'm sorry about last night. I was just fooling around. Dad's here ! Hey, son ! You ready for some breakfast ? Yeah ! Get dressed. You know me, joycie, I get carried away. I thought it was funny at the time. You really bought into it, didn't you ? ( Man ) Did he say who he shot ? ( Joyce ) No. You have no idea who the victim might be ? No, I'm sorry. Did you husband have a-- it's my ex-husband. Did he have a weapon ? Blood on his clothes ? No, nothing, I checked. Do you two live together ? No, he has his own place. What's his address ? Look, if I'm wrong, I don't wanna ruin his reputation. He's a-- he's a professional man. He's a dentist. Ma'am, if you're serious about this, I suggest that you come in and make a formal statement. The neighborhood dentist is on a killing spree, news at eleven. ( Joyce ) Sorry, I don't feel like dinner tonight. What's wrong ? I don't know, I think i'm coming down with something. You're not still upset about last night, are you ? No, of course not, I just don't think you should risk catching this. Joycie, don't do anything stupid. What are you talking about ? ( Gasping ) Hi, dad ! Thought if you were sick, you might need some food, Chinese. You'll never believe what happened. Peg montez, the bitch from the dental lab, she had a seizure notice pasted right on my front door ! You know what she wants ? $15,000. I'll tell you something, she's got a snowball's chance in hell of ever getting that ! Here, Silvia wanted you to have this. It's an invitation to her cousin's baby shower or something. I'm sorry, I'd ask you to stay, but I'm just going straight to bed. Oh, that's okay. I'm gonna take Christopher off your hands, I'll sleep right here on the sofa, in case you need me. Son, come on, we're gonna take care of your mommy. There you go ! Get some plates ! Uno ! Dos ! Tres ! ( Children chattering ) Hey, Chris, there's Jordan ! They found him in the backseat, shot through the heart. He had condoms in his pocket. Hi. Hey ! The police think he was rolled by a hooker and her pimp. Who ? Uh, a patient's husband. Someone shot dead on the east side. Which patient ? Mmm, it's right here. Gloria Shaw, you know her ? Yeah, she knows her. Well, it's a curse. I mean, I tell you, that office is cursed. This, uh, Gloria Shaw's husband was not the first one who's died. Two of Stan's dental assistants also lost their husbands. One was shot dead, and the other died in a dynamite explosion. Here, have some wine. Well, you knew about this, didn't you, Joyce ? Whoa, three dead husbands. Silvie, the minute you get married, you're outta there. ( Christopher ) Mommy, why do we have to leave so soon ? Stan's first wife also lost a husband. He was shot. They were only married six months. Joyce, these people all died over like a period of 20 years. I know, but they never figured out who killed them, and they're all connected to Stan ! I even knew one of the widows. She was marcia, one of Stan's ex-dental assistants. When her husband was killed, she had to be hospitalized to keep herself from committing suicide. So he told you he killed somebody, and then he acted like it was a joke ? All along, all I've been thinking about was him cheating on me. How could I be so dumb ? Hey, maybe that's his angle, here. I mean, he's got you off the scent, doesn't he ? I mean, you're not even thinking about another woman. Do you think that's it ? I think that he's a liar and he treats you like dirt. Why would he kill his ex-wife's husband ? Or Gloria's husband, the dental assistants' husbands ? For the money ? This is a man who has his own dental practice. He helps poor people for free, he doesn't have to do that. You know, I'm afraid to be alone in the house with him ? He's always there, I can't get rid of him ! If he was involved in this, now, don't you think that the police would have already caught onto him ? What is it, Joyce ? Hasn't he done enough ? He has to be a killer for you to get him outta your life ? ( Stan ) Ah, it's just another classic example of the government going after the wrong guy. Believe me, there's not one thing that I've done in my life that when I arrive at those gates, old Saint Pete isn't gonna be standing there with his arms wide open, saying, "come on in, come on in, Stan !" ( Man on television ) At 4:45 this afternoon, dental lab owner peg montez was killed when she pulled out of her parking space, and her car exploded. Montez was leaving her place of business, a dental lab on south grand. Police are now left with a giant puzzle, just who would want to kill this quiet, middle-aged divorcee ? Reporting on the scene, I'm Grant Jackson, news 19. More news in just a moment. ( Joyce ) I'm afraid he'll find out I'm here. He's threatened to kill me. And if you help US, we'll protect you. Why did the police turn me over to you ? Well, the a-t-f is called in whenever a bomb is used. It's a federal offense. Now, why do you think your husband would wanna kill peg montez ? Well, she was suing him for $15,000. We know that. Then, you don't need me. Oh, on the contrary. We had Dr. Benderman in for questioning, he was extremely uncooperative. Do you suspect him ? Let's just talk about you right now. What do you know about the bombing ? Not much. There were other things, I really don't know anything, but I have some suspicions, a lot of suspicions. I think, uh, he's killed before. Maybe seven people, if you count peg. The husbands of two of his dental assistants, the husband of his ex-wife, the parents and the husband of his last mistress, does this sound crazy ? ( Joyce ) Listen, I would love to be wrong about this, I just know that I'm not, and I've told you everything that I know, that's all I have. I don't buy it, it's too farfetched, a neighborhood dentist ? Why would she make up a story like this ? Maybe she wants revenge. He cheated on her, he screwed her in alimony payments. Look at the cast of characters who are supposed to be his accomplices. A cub scout mother, a kindergarten teacher, and a member of the bowling team ? Two dental assistants ? Her story checks out, the cases are all unsolved. The police never had much to go on any of them. If he did it, he's been real careful. Okay, I want this dentist checked out, up and down. Every murder scene, every police file. Mrs. Benderman, you got a minute ? ( McNally ) Okay... Ah, please, take a seat. I apologize for the theatrics. We didn't want anyone to know that you were meeting with US. What's going on ? Well, we've checked out your ex-husband, and he has an undisputed alibi. There's nothing concrete connecting him with any of the murders, no fingerprints, no witnesses, no obvious motive, even in the case of peg montez. Her son stands to profit more than Dr. Benderman. No, he killed her, I know he did. Well, all right. If you're right, then he's been very careful, and there's not much we can do without your help. We need you to get him to corroborate your testimony. Excuse me ? We need you to get him to confess, on tape. You can't be serious ! We're prepared to offer you and your son a new life and a new identity, under the federal witness protection program. This is a man who threatened to kill me, or hire someone else to do it. We'll protect you. No one will know what you're doing but the people in this room. There will be no leaks. The police won't even know who you are. You'll only be known by a confidential informant number. I couldn't possibly get him to confess. You don't know how cagey he is. He opened up to you that one night. He admitted he'd killed. He's smarter than I am, okay ? He'd be onto it in a second, he's already suspicious. ( Man ) We'll work with you. Help you with what to say, how to bring him out. How would you do this ? We'll put a body wire on her. No, not enough. Joyce, we're gonna wire your home. There'll be a surveillance Van out in front of your door. We'll be listening to every word. If anything goes wrong, we'll be armed and ready. What about his ex-wife or Gloria ? Couldn't you investigate them ? There's not enough for a warrant. And without the leverage of criminal charges, I doubt if they'd confess. Look, guys, I would-- if I were alone, I would do this, but I have a son. I can't put him through this, that's his father. Mrs. Benderman, what did you expect ? Did you think we could lock him up, just on your word ? If you can't help US, there's a strong possibility your son will be brought up by a multiple murderer. What if he stops by and finds you here ? ( McNally ) I've put a tail on him. From now on, he'll be followed 24 four hours a day. So how often does he come over ? Whenever I let him, I can't get rid of him. And when he does come, does he stay the night ? No, not anymore. Now, you see this gray Van out here ? That's US. If we hear anything amiss, we'll be right in. All right, so, uh, this is the first time through, just try to act natural. Get used to the idea of being recorded, and don't try to draw him out. You don't want him picking up on any unusual behavior. Don't worry, I just wanna get through this. I can't wait for this to be over. Hi, mom ! Hi. Hey. ( Joyce ) Hi. ( Stan ) Hey, put this in your room. ( Christopher ) Okay. We're about to have dinner, so go wash your hands, okay ? Okay. Everything okay ? Yeah. Yeah ? You just look a little-- well, you know, I've had kind of a rough day today. You know, with the heat and all. Also, I got this prank phone call. Oh, yeah, what'd they say ? Well, actually, it was the second one today, and it was a woman's voice, and it was the same woman both times, and she just said "murderer", and hung up. It kinda shook me up. Where is she coming up with this stuff ? She's winging it. Did you see the paper ? No. Well, they mentioned they had me in for questioning because of this peg montez thing. You didn't tell me that. Well, I was just thinking maybe the caller was one of peg's friends. You know, looked your phone number up in the phone book. No, no, I know who it was. There's this arrogant s.O.B. Who works for the alcohol, firearms and explosives crew. Mcbay, or mc-something or other. The cops handed me over to him for questioning. He probably put someone up to it, to shake me up. He didn't like the idea, they couldn't manipulate me into taking a polygraph test, or a test for explosive residue. Are you a suspect ? Well, you know, there was money involved, and I can't say as I'm sorry that peg is dead. It was a fortuitous event. $20,000 saved, including lawyer's fees. That's a lot of money. I had an airtight alibi, of course. I was doing a root canal on a nun. Then, again, if I was responsible, for the bombing, I'd have been smart enough to have somebody else do it, don't you think ? You look like you need to lay down. Maybe you and I should slip into the boudoir, babe. Stan, I told you I'm not ready for that. Christopher, are you in bed ? Is dad gone ? Yeah, he's gone. I'll be in, in a minute, honey. Oh, boy, how'd I do ? Joyce, you did well. Now, you didn't have to push so hard, but you did well. You got it all, right ? Every word. Psst, come here. You heard what he said about hiring someone to set the bomb ? Well, he admitted it, right ? I mean, we've got him. It's a start. It's a start ? We need a lot more than that to make a case. We practically need him to come out and say the word "kill". Without that, a good lawyer could get him off. He could go free ? We'd protect you, in either case. Well, what if he were to find out that I'm the one that set him up ? We can't hide that. You're the one that's gonna be testifying against him. Testifying ? You mean, I have to face him in court ? Look, the tapes are no good, without you to back them up. But you don't know him ! If he finds out that I set him up, he'll do anything to get me ! Joyce, listen, I know that what we're asking you to do is not an easy thing, but you've gotta stick with this. There are many more things he could admit, many bits and pieces. And, frankly, that's what it's gonna take to make a case. Those federal pimps are out to get me. How'd they get onto you so quick ? The money, the lawsuit, her relatives knew about it, knew that I had threatened her. But they don't have anything on you, do they ? Not a thing. It'll pass, just like the other times. The other times, you weren't a suspect. Don't you worry about it, if they had anything on me, they would have charged me already. There's not one shred of evidence. What about Gloria ? I mean, you know, what if they put that together ? They're too hung up on peg montez and the car bomb ! Never in their wildest dreams would they put that together. Ah, Gloria could panic and talk. You know, she could-- she could make a deal for herself. Gloria knows who pulled her out of the gutter. She'll never talk. Besides, she'd have to give up the money. What about Joyce ? Don't you worry about Joyce. Ah, I met a lot of guys who were in prison because of their ex-wives. Not Joyce. Joycie knows enough to keep her mouth shut. ( McNally ) He's talking, if he trusts you. Yeah, well, that's only because he knows I'm afraid of him. Thanks. Don't be, we're right behind you. There's, uh, an important piece we need to make the case. The bomb that killed peg montez was made with a kind of pressure switch used by special forces in Vietnam. We need to link him with somebody in the military, someone who showed him how to use the switches. I'll do what I can. Oh, here's the money for your babysitter, and, uh, just tell me if there's anything else you need. Thank you. Then, there's the subject of the other murders. Oh, I couldn't get him to talk about the others. Forget it. Oh, don't be so sure. No, he'd be onto me in a split second, really, there's no way. Joyce, let me see if I can give you something to work with, how about I plant a little article in tomorrow's paper, and see if we can get a rise out of him ? You can do that ? We're gonna have to get you a tryout with the cardinals ! Hey, guys, you have fun ? He is turning into quite a little ballplayer. ( Phone ringing ) Hello ? Mom. Hello ? Well, hi ! Yeah, okay, okay, thanks. Buh-bye. Ooh, that was weird. Who was that ? Silvia, she said that you should be sure to read the paper today ? This is outrageous ! Hmm ? Look at this ! "The team of federal agents investigating a bombing "have also been studying three other violent deaths, "including three unsolved killings, after which Dr. Benderman received financial benefit ?" Total lies ! It also says you got money from your ex-wife and former dental assistants ? Those women made legitimate investments in my clinic ! I had nothing to do with their husbands' deaths ! This is slander. You got that right, I know what's going on here. The feds got the reporters onto me ! Why ? Are you kidding ? They're after me, they already got a tail on me. I spotted them yesterday after I left work. That's how desperate they are, how inept they are. They don't wanna get their suits wrinkled by going after the real criminals ! Oh, my-- my, my, my, my. How did they get onto all of this ? Well, they haven't got a shot in hell of making a case against me. I got books on rules of evidence. This is all just hot air ! It also says you're an explosives expert ? That's what it says right here. They have to lay that one on me too ! Well, between you and me, that one might be just a little closer to the truth. I didn't know you knew how to blow up things. You know, I always just thought of you in dental school, you know, studying diagrams of teeth. Oh, I know my explosives. Well, how'd you pick that up ? I learned under the very best, an old demolition powder monkey from world war ii. ( Both ) Yes ! Dad, come see my fort ! I'll be right there. Oh, they are really onto me, what will they try next ? ( Cat meowing ) What's that noise ? You know what ? I forgot something. They must have been around to talk to you, Joyce. I'd have told you that. Joycie, you're the ex-wife. I'm sure that they've been around. They wouldn't pass that opportunity by. No, they haven't, I swear. You wouldn't lie to me, would you ? Dad, come see ! I'll be right there ! ( Cat meowing ) It's the cat, it's gotta be the cat. Joyce ? Don't do anything stupid. ( Phone ringing ) What is this damn cat doing at my feet ?! Hello ? Hold on, it's for you. Hello ? Get the cat out of there, now. Oh, okay, thank you very much. I said, I'll be right there ! Fluffy, you're outta here ! ( Stan ) Good job, kiddo-- so who was that ? Oh, it was just somebody from work. They're changing my shift. Well, I'm gonna go see my lawyer. He's gonna crucify whoever was responsible for this. They'll have to eat their words. I may get rich with this. Don't think I'm not watching you too. Well ? You heard that, didn't you ? What he said about the explosives ? You did good, Joyce, you did damn good. He was eating out of your hand. Yeah, okay, what next ? Well, we had some bad news. The u-s attorney's office has lost confidence in the case. What do you mean ? Somebody confessed to the murder of Brad Shaw. Who ?! Turner issacs. He was picked up for some other murders, a detective found out that he lived right next door to the parking lot where Brad's body was found, he got him talking. He said that he killed Shaw just after an attempted robbery. So what, so all this goes down the drain now ? Well, right now, the tapes aren't enough to convince the lawyers. He's been too careful about what he's said. He did it, you know he did it. What's gonna happen if all this falls through ? I just go back to life as usual ? Without you, I'll never get rid of him. I won't let that happen. Joyce, you put yourself on the line for me. I'll do the same for you. You have my word. Mom ? What's dad doing ? I don't know, honey. Maybe benderman hired Turner issacs. Joyce said he knew some ex-cons. It wasn't in issacs' statement. I think there's reason to question his statement. There's too many details. The guy's got a photographic memory, right in the middle of an armed robbery ? Then, his memory suddenly fails him when the cops take him back to the scene ? He tells them the car was parked a quarter of a mile away from the actual location. Ah, I think we'll have a little talk with Mr. Issacs tomorrow. So what do you care whether I killed the dude or not ? Ah, we've got this guy we're looking at. We think maybe he had something to do with it. Maybe he hired you, maybe you did it together. Tell it like it is, whitey. If I gave you what you want, what you're looking for, what's in it for me ? What do you want ? He had nothing to do with it. It seems he was pressured into signing a statement. Some detective who wanted a promotion, threatened his family, bribed him with money and valium. He killed five people, one more didn't matter to him. Did the detective get the promotion ? Two, so far. Well, that should put a lid on it. I-- I told you not to call me, unless it's an emergency. Is it an emergency ? I saw the paper, and I'm scared. What are you worried about ? They haven't said anything about you. What if they put two and two together ? Why should they ? Honey, they-- they already got a guy who's confessed to killing your husband ! Stan, I need to see you, I can't get through this alone ! Babe, babe, babe. They are watching me, it is too dangerous ! Look, it's too dangerous to leave me alone ! I won't be left hanging ! Look, you promised me that you were gonna get me through this ! You know where I am, so do it ! ( Dial tone ) I knew you'd come. I told you that I would take care of you, huh ? Now, just relax, relax, relax ! You know, I was thinking about that moment that I shot Brad. I really put myself into that. Am I getting through to you ? I like killing, Gloria. Not many men have a taste for it. It sets a man apart from his fellow man, if he knows how to snuff out a human life. Don't ever tell me to do it again. ( Gasping ) ( Car horn blaring ) Look, we're under the gun here. They want results, you gotta quit your job, and start working for US full-time. From now on, you're a special employee of the federal government. What's that ? Some stupid mind game Stan's playing on me. ( Joyce ) Okay, McNally, I'm going after his first dental assistant, Betsy lund, wish me luck. I got a strange message on my machine. They didn't leave a name, but it sounded like your old assistant, Betsy. She'd never call here. Well, maybe she saw what was in the papers and got concerned. About what ? I don't know, she did give you $16,000, and you are the suspect in a bombing, and her husband died in a bombing. I know, I was there. So were three other people, it was an accident. They can all testify that I tried to save the poor bastard. Well, the papers said that she applied for insurance benefits the night he died, and she had his body cremated the next day. I don't know, the reporters seem to think it was suspicious. So what does that have to do with me ? She's set, now, she's better off. You do everyone a favor when you get rid of scum like that. Are you saying someone got rid of him ? I'm just saying that some things are meant to be ? Why are you so curious, Joyce ? We can't use any of that ? He's a paranoid individual. We can't expect an outright admission. Well, he didn't say anything all night. Nothing we can use, anyway. You're doing great, Joyce, just hang in there. Tonight, concentrate on peg. You're wasting the taxpayers' money. That's right, you heard me, fatso. Why would I have bothered killing peg ? I would have won the lawsuit ! Come on, you said yourself, you would have lost. And you were ahead $20,000, and that her death was a fortuitous event. Joyce, you keep harping about this. You sound like a needle stuck in the groove ! Oh, McNally, I'm losing sleep over this. I'm getting sick. He's toying with me, he's enjoying it. There's nothing there that we can use. He's getting more paranoid. He stopped a man on the street, thinking the guy was tailing him. The man was not one of ours. Joyce, we can't leave you in much longer. He's getting more unpredictable, more difficult to tail. For all we know, he's onto you. He's just stringing you along. For what ? For an opportunity to get rid of you. I think it's time we got your affairs in order, in case we have to take you out in a moment's notice. ( Christopher ) I didn't mean to break the window. ( Stan ) Anybody see you break it ? No, sir. Son, don't be so worried about breaking the rules. They weren't meant for boys like you. You're special, you're above the other boys. You're smarter. You can do things they can't. Kiddo, one day, I'm gonna teach you everything I know. McNally ? Can I speak to you alone, please ? Everyone, could we clear the room, please ? McNally, we're getting nowhere. What happens if he keeps this up ? We'll pull the plug and go with what we've got. Can we get a conviction ? It's a long shot. He still hasn't said the word "killed". You know, I've been thinking about the times when he's opened up to me, when he's let his guard down, and mostly that's been in the bedroom. That was when he told me that he killed Brad Shaw. That was also the last time we slept together, but I know he's ready to anytime I want to, so I think we should bug the bedroom. You don't have to do this. I know, but I want this thing to end. I can't stand one more day of my child getting more attached to that monster. ( Car honking ) ( Phone ringing ) Hello ? Yeah, he's here, it's for you. Who is it ? Damn it, they lost the tail. Joyce, go check the front. He's down the block, he's almost here ! ( McNally ) All right, everybody out the back, now ! Joyce, Joyce, stall him ! Joyce, move ! Have you seen fluffy ? Joyce, I can't find my damn wallet, it must have fallen out when I dropped Christopher off. Ugh ! Oh, where the hell is it ? Oh, ah... Right in front of my face, buh-bye. I can't handle this anymore, I feel like a ping pong ball. If we win, I'm free, if he wins, I'm dead. He'd kill me in a split second. We won't let that happen. How can you say that ?! Your men lost him, he could have just walked right in here ! It won't happen again. I'm putting a team on him from now on. He's onto you. You don't understand how dangerous he is. Of course I understand. You see, he's playing cat-and-mouse with US right now. The important thing to remember is that you've still got his trust. Yeah, that's just 'cause he thinks I'm too dumb to pull anything. Well, that's his mistake, isn't it ? Yeah... big mistake. Oh, I was just thinking about you. Are you still coming over tonight ? Good, 'cause I'm planning something special. Okay... bye. ( Christopher ) Mom, I need you. What, sweetie ? What is it ? Mom, I didn't do my homework. You didn't do your homework, why didn't you tell me ? 'Cause you weren't around. I was with the sitter. What am I gonna tell my teacher ? I'll write you a note this time, but I want you to do your homework. Listen, I know I haven't been around much. Don't you worry, things are gonna change. I'm gonna take care of you, okay ? What are you up to, Joyce ? I need you... tonight. ( Stan ) You missed me, babe, didn't you ? ( Joyce ) God, I did. I'm a little worried about Christopher, he's beginning to ask questions. I think the boys at school are beginning to talk. About what ? About all the horrible things they're saying about you. He hasn't mentioned it to me. Well, how could he ? To him, you can do no wrong. What's gonna happen when he's older ? What's he gonna think about all this ? I pray that he loves me enough that he won't let it bother him. Stan ? Is there a chance that they could take you away from US ? My mother did my chart a long time ago. She said it was my fate to be separated from my family and friends at the end of my life. She saw betrayal at the hands of women. Decay, betrayal. What's the matter, Joyce ? You're not one of those women, are you ? How could I be ? You're the father of my child. Did you believe her ? Well, she had a gift. You know, if I were you, I'd wonder about Gloria. Why Gloria ? Well, isn't she the one that profited the most ? Gloria's husband was killed by a man who's behind bars. I know, but of all the women, Gloria looks the most suspicious. I mean, after all, her husband wasn't just the only one killed there. Her in-laws were killed also by someone. Where did you hear about her in-laws ? I read the paper. Well, you didn't read it that day ! I took it to work. Yeah, you did, why did you do that, Stan ? You have something to hide ? Come on, this is you and me, Stan, I need to know ! I mean, you're the father of my child, I have a right. Joyce, what are you saying ? You think that I killed them ? Hey, Joyce, i-- I do not kill people ! Did you have them killed ? I don't kill people, Joyce ! You want me to acknowledge a murder that I did not commit ! Stan, it's just you and me, you can level with me. You are no longer my wife. You can go in and testify against me ! Oh, get serious. No ! We are no longer married. You want me to acknowledge a murder, so that you can go in and testify ! You're crazy, Stan, why would I do that ? You're the father of my child. I just need to know ! You just won't quit, will you ? I do not kill people. You start accusing me of killing people, I start wondering if I am in a bugged room. I got a book on bugging, Joyce. And I know what every wire in this house is for. Every wire, babe ! Mom, I can't sleep. Oh, come here, honey. What's the matter with him ? He had a bad dream, come on, lie down, it's okay, it's okay. Psst, hey ! ( Whispering ) I am not done with you, this is not finished. ( Wheels screeching ) You really got US worried on that one, Joyce. You really got US going. ( Sobbing ) You're okay, you're okay. ( McNally ) Your car ? ( Joyce ) A friend said she'd buy it from me. What about the landlord here ? He needs a month's notice. We can take care of that. When do we leave ? As soon as you're packed. It's a weak case. Well, we can't monitor him here anymore. I hate to leave it like this. I don't wanna be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. Joyce, I don't want that for you either, but he just doesn't trust you the way he did before. You know what kills me, McNally ? I'm sure, deep down, he'd love to tell me. He'd probably get off bragging about it. You're probably right. But he's too paranoid to do it in a room he thinks is bugged. What if you bug me ? A body wire ? Someone mentioned the possibility. You'll be in a car, alone with him. He could find the wire. We could lose you in traffic, it's dangerous. McNally, after what we've been through, I can't handle dangerous ? You look good, Joyce. I'm surprised you wanted to see me. Well, I just wanted to go someplace where we could talk. What about ? Where are we going ? It's a surprise. ( Wheels screeching ) What are you doing ? Staying ahead of the game. You hungry, Joyce ? Starving. All right, boys, he's heading west on seventh. You copy ? Yeah, we got him. ( Piano playing ) Okay, I didn't want to say anything over the phone, but a reporter called me. He wants more material for another story. I told him to talk to your lawyer. Boy, they never give up, do they ? They wanna know about marcia. Why can't they just give up on this and leave US alone ? They just keep rehashing old stuff. Now, I'm worried about marcia's mental stability. Marcia's stable. When I saw her the last time, she was over it. Well, because he said he was gonna head out to California to talk to her. Can I get you anything else ? Uh, no, the check will be fine. They can't prove that she gave me any money. ( Joyce ) Did you get a lot of it ? She was supposed to get about 100,000. It turned out that she didn't make sure that one of her husband's policies was switched over from his parents to her. Didn't she know to do that ? You can't hold them by the hand and do everything for them, as a friend, that is. To her, I was a father figure. That's right, I remember. Didn't you put she and her husband together ? Yeah, I introduced them. I thought so. He was a good match for her, average working-class man, from an average working-class family. Thank you. So you were the matchmaker, huh ? Yeah, it wasn't the first time. There were others. Who ? Why do you ask, Joyce ? Want me to do it for you ? I'm sure you'd be good at it. Yeah, yeah, I introduced them. I introduced them all. My ex-wife, Betsy, Gloria, their husbands all handpicked by me. They were better off for it. They never would have gotten out of the hole on their own. You have to take care of women. Well, you sure know how to do that, Stan. Don't you wonder why all that's coming out in the papers again ? It's been a month since peg montez got dynamited. They haven't come up with anything, so they have to dig up this out of the woodwork. Maybe somebody dropped a quarter into the box, put a bug in their ear. But who, who would do that ? Marcia ? No. Well, you know how guilty she felt after-- no, no, not marcia. Why not ? Because we were very intimate, me and marcia. You slept with her ? No, no, honey. You see, there's sexual intimacy, and there's something else. I was not sexually intimate with marcia. Well, if not sexually, then how ? Homicidally. I was homicidally intimate with marcia. Yes ! When you've been keeping a secret to yourself for weeks and months, and you finally get back together with your partner, oh, there is such an outpouring, such a release. That's what I had with marcia. It's the ultimate intimacy. Maybe you'd like it, joycie. Maybe I would. I know I would. Say the word. Come on, Stan, tell me what you did. Say "killed", damn it ! Come on, tell me, you know I know already. Come on, tell me. I wanna have what they had with you. There's nobody here, it's just you and me. Nobody else can hear, tell me. I killed them, I killed them all. With these hands, right here. Play that back, play that back. I killed them, I killed them all. Why ? Why did you do it ? The money ? No ! No, it's the, um, it's the ultimate. The ultimate what, power ? Thrill. I hope you got that, guys. What, Joyce ? Dr. Benderman, I think you know who I am. Joyce ! ( Man ) Let's go, Dr. Benderman. Come on, Dr. Benderman, you're under arrest. Take it easy. You have the right to remain silent... ( Stan grunting ) Joyce ! Joyce ! ( McNally ) Joyce ? Good luck. Thank you. You okay ? Yeah. Good, let's go. Captioning made possible by lifetime television captioned by soundwriters™
