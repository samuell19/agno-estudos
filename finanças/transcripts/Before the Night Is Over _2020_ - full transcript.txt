And around here, that means something. - I had no idea about the house, the debts, or you. - Let's not dwell on unpleasant subjects, not more than we need to anyway. Welcome to DeWolfe's Gentlemen's Club, the reason your mother wouldn't tell you about me. - Do all of these men- - Work for me? Yes. And, for now, you will as well. I don't mind giving you room and board, but if you're wanting money of your own, well, (chuckles) there's plenty of tidying up to do around here. - Yes, well, I wouldn't expect you to. That is, was my mother's. - Yes. She left it to me for safekeeping until you were ready for it. - I would like it now, please. - I will give you a full set of keys for each of the rooms. Please, treat them with respect. - I live here, as does Ms. Olivia, but our rooms are private, so please never intrude unless it is an emergency. Do you understand? - I do. - Samantha? - Yes? - Don't make me regret my decision. (stairs creaking) (switch clicks) (door creaking) (gentle music) (locks clicking) (people whispering) (alcohol pouring) (ice rattling) (glasses clinking) To your bones. (telephone rings) Good evening. DeWolfe's Gentlemen's Club. Well, good evening, Mr. Wheatstraw. (knife rasps) This Friday? Well, we weren't expecting you so soon. Of course. We'll have your special room ready. Look forward to seeing you. Goodnight. (knife rasps) (glasses clinking) (doorbell chimes) (Ms. DeWolfe sighs) Were we expecting anyone this late at night? - Not that I know of. (ominous music) Well, hello. How can I be of service? - Are you still open for business? - We sure are. Don't I know you from somewhere? - I don't think so. I'm from out of town. Are any of your men free for the night? - Well, none of them are free per se- - You know what I mean, woman. - Sure do. Right this way. I think we got what you're looking for. (bottle spraying) (cloth squeaking) (mirror scraping) - You must be the new maid. Saw you looking at me when you came in. - Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. - D'you like what you saw? - To be honest, I'm not really sure what I was looking at. - Boy, you're not gonna last long. I'm so sure of that, I'm not even gonna tell you my name. - Really? - Really. Now, are you done? Because I really got to take a piss. (mysterious music) (door rattling) (keys jingling) (lock clicking) (keys jingling) (lock clicking) (Samantha sighs) - Can I help you? - I don't think I have the key to this room. - No one does, except for Ms. DeWolfe, Ms. Olivia, and myself. - How am I supposed to clean it, then? - What's behind that door is none of your concern. Now, it's late. You must be very tired. Why don't you go to bed? - Yes. I'm sorry, sir. - Well, first, there's nothing to be sorry about. And second, you may call me Ambrose. Now get some rest. We have a lot of work to do in the morning, Samantha.

Are any of your men free for the evening? (person screaming) (gun fires) (indistinct) - [Ambrose] Get him outta here! - Stay in your room. - What's going- - I said, stay in your fucking room. - It's nothing, Samantha. Just one of the patrons got a little drunk, that's all. We've called the police. Everything will be all right. Be a good girl, go to bed. (door closes) (birds chirping) (broom sweeping) - This place is a god damn maze. Oh, excuse me. Do you happen to know where Room 29 is? - Sorry, I'm new here. - Oh, ain't that just swell? I got an eight o'clock appointment. I'm already 10 minutes late. - Oh, hey, Jenkins. You old can of paint. How the hell are you? - Damn it, LaRue, I told you, no real names. - Oh, come on, Clayton, we're all family here. - Yeah, you tell that to my damn wife. (Clay chuckles) - Hi. - Come on, Clayton, your clock's running out. (Clay chuckles) (foot thuds) - Oh, damnation! (LaRue speaking in foreign language) (lighter clicks) - Watch your step, Clay. - [Clay] Can't see a damn thing in here. - I call it mood lighting. - Dark. The word is dark. - You know what they say, some things are best done by touch. - Oh, LaRue, you're a firecracker. - Yes, sir. A firecracker with a long fuse. (Clay chuckles) (body thuds) (mellow music) - That's my man you're looking at, miss. It's okay, though, I like looking at him too. Name's Duke and his name is Jameson, but I call him Jamie. What should I call you? - I'm Samantha. Samantha Pearl. I'm the new maid. How long have you two been working here? - We've been working here for what seems like forever, but it's nice. At this point, everyone seems like family, you know? - Yeah. - Well, you better get back to your chores before Ms. Olivia catches you talking to me. She can get rather prickly when she wants to. - I'll keep that in mind. Nice meeting you, Duke. - [Duke] Mm. (Clay sighs) (Clay groans) - I thought this is what you wanted. - Man can't eat the same meal every night, no matter how good it tastes. - Is that all I am to you, Clay? A chicken fried steak? (hand slaps) - Who is that girl I was talking to in the hallway? Pretty thing, ass like a ripe Georgia peach. - The new maid. Quiet type. - Yeah. Let's stick her into the mix, huh? See if we can't get some sparks to fly. (Clay laughs) (door closes) - Greasy fucker. (LaRue spits) (ominous music) (eerie music) (Samantha gasps) - Ain't you the prettiest thing? You can call me Clay, 'cause if you treat me nice, I'll be putty in your hands. There's no need to be shy with me. I ain't gonna hurt you. I just want to be your friend. (Samantha groans) (Clay sniffs) (Clay whimpers) Why do you young girls smell so damn good? It's like freshly clean linen on a Sunday morning. (Clay chuckles) (eerie music) (Clay panting) Damn sneaky, little bitch. Run away from me, will you? (Clay panting) From now on, I stick to boys. They don't run so fast. (Clay sighs) (Clay coughing) (Clay panting) (footsteps treading) Is that you? You come to apologize? You better say you're sorry. Nobody does that to old Clay. (suspenseful music) (pipe clunks) (Clay groans) No, no, no, no, no! (pipe clunks) (Clay groans) (pipe clunks) (Clay groans) (pipe clunking) (blood spattering) (insects buzzing) (crickets chirping) (wind blowing) (gentle guitar music) (wind blowing) (water running) - Hey. (Samantha gasps) Everything okay? - You startled me, that's all. I thought I was alone. - What are you doing up? Can't sleep? - Yeah. (lighter clicks) (Jamie inhales) - I have that problem too. (Jamie exhales) Some nights, I can't do nothing but stare at the ceiling till the sun comes up. - Why do you do this, Jameson? You seem so- - Jamie. You can call me Jamie. - Why do you do this, Jamie? I'm sure you could find other ways to- - I never made it past the ninth grade. All of the kids picked on me so bad because I was different. - Why don't you and Duke run away together, find work someplace else? - I don't know. Sometimes, I think he likes it here more than he likes me. - Has he ever told you that he loves you? - It's late. You want me to walk you back to your room? - No, but thank you, Jamie. - I'll see you around. Goodnight, Samantha. (ominous music) (insects buzzing) (crickets chirping) (gentle music) - Have you ever heard the old folktale about Blue Beard and his seven wives? - I'm sorry, I didn't see you there. No, I've never heard that story. - Blue Beard was a rich nobleman who had married several women. It was rumored that he had them all murdered. When he married his seventh wife, he gave her the keys to his chateau with the instructions that she could enter any room she wished, except for the underground chamber. Each of the rooms that she was allowed to enter contained vast riches. Gold, silver, jewels. So you think she would have had the good sense to let well enough alone, but curiosity always gets the best of us, doesn't it? When she finally entered the basement, do you know what she found? - No. - All the Blue Beard's former wives, all dead, hung up on meat hooks. - I just wanted something of my mother's, to remember her by. - It's not always wise to stir up the past, Samantha. Leave well enough alone? (Samantha sighs) (ominous music) - What are you doing? - Nothing. I was just- - You know, I had your number from the moment you walked in here. You may act all innocent and sweet, but I know what you're up to. You have that hungry look. Oh, what, cat got your tongue? The name's Wild Bill, but my clients call me Wild Bill Big Cock 'cause I'm the number one stud in this stable. Now, make no mistake, I'm not like the queers that work here. I like women. Sure, I'll screw anything if the price is right, but when the whistle blows at the end of my shift, it's the ladies for old Wild Bill. So, what do you say? - Well, see, I don't believe the lady is at all interested in your cut-rate charms, Willie. - How many times do I have to tell you? The name's Wild Bill Big Cock. - You'll have to excuse William over here. He's new. - Yeah, new and sick of you tired ass amateurs. Why don't you suck my big, fat cock, that is if you have the money to pay for the privilege. - And what he lacks in looks, he more than makes up for in charm. Don't you think? Now why don't you run along before William over here starts salivating all over you again? Go on now. - Next time, why don't you mind your own damn business? - My business is scoring Mr. Wheatstraw tomorrow. - Over my dead body. I'm gonna buck that bronco for all its worth. - Well, we'll see about that, Little Willie. We'll just see. (broom sweeping) - Ma'am? - Can I help you? - I'm Sheriff Dwight and this here is my partner Shane. We're here on official police business. - [Ms. DeWolfe] Dwight? - Why, Ms. Blanche DeWolfe, you certainly do look enchanting this evening. - You do have a gift for flattery, Dwight. Hello, Shane. How's the rain on the rhubarb? - Howdy, Ms. DeWolfe. - Why don't you both come into my office and sit a spell? - Sounds good. - Could you tell me where the bathroom is? - Down the hall, on the left. Can't miss it. - I'll be right back. - [Dwight] Mm-hm. (door rattles) (Shane sighs) - I'm lost. - It's right here. - Well, now I feel like a damn fool. - It's okay, it's a big house. - Are you new here? I don't think I've seen you before. - I'm Samantha, the new maid. - Well, hello, Samantha. Thanks for... - Um. - Oh. Yeah, sorry. Thanks, Samantha. (door closes) (Samantha sighs) - [Ms. DeWolfe] How can I help you, Dwight? You're not gonna shut me down again, are you? - We've been looking for a missing person for a couple of days, by the name of Estus Wise. Just wondering if you two might've crossed paths recently. - Estus Wise. He the preacher? Oh, I used to see him on television every Sunday morning, screaming up a storm. - One in the same. - Well, Dwight, what would a preacher be doing in a place like this? People talk. - You never know. People have a funny way of surprising you. - Yes, they do. But haven't seen him, except on TV. I'm sorry, I can't help you, Dwight. - Sorry about that. I got a bit lost. (Dwight sighs) - Mind if I leave Shane here, ask around, see if any of your men might've seen him? - All of our clients speak with me first. But of course. - Well, Blanche, thank you for your time. Sorry to just barge in unannounced. I hope the next time we visit, it's with some more pleasant news. - Ms. Pearl, could you please go to the attic and bring down a bottle of our good brandy, and bring it to the main room for Deputy Shane? - Oh, I don't want to be no trouble. - Oh, it's no trouble at all, handsome. - Yes, Ms. Olivia. (switch clicks) (ominous music) (floor creaks) (newspaper rustling) (box rustling) (light buzzing) (rain pattering) (door opens) - [Ms. Olivia] Why did you invite Shane in here? A police officer of all things. - [Ms. DeWolfe] What was I supposed to do, June? - [Ms. Olivia] Say we were all booked up. He goes around asking questions, snooping around- - [Ms. DeWolfe] It would look more suspicious if we didn't. - [Ms. Olivia] Well, get rid of him. Make him vanish, make him disappear. Now. (door closes) (switch clicks) - You have to be careful. This door has a bad habit of locking itself shut. - [Woman] Our very civilization is at stake. The lives and future of all my subjects are in jeopardy. - [Man] For my part, I should tend to the Garden of Life and, there, capture them when they return. - [Woman] No. - Howdy. Promise I didn't do it. And if I did, I didn't mean to. - I'm not here to arrest you. My name's Shane. - Nice to meet you, Shane. Name's Ned LaRue, but everybody calls me LaRue. Pleasure to make your company. - I'm here because we have a missing person by the name of Estus Wise. Have you seen him around? - No, I haven't. You don't forget a face like that. - That's true, I guess. Well, I'm gonna ask the other guys. Thank you, LaRue. - See you around, Shane. (LaRue sighs) You like what you see? - What? - Your eyes are burning a hole through my ass, Shane. - So I was wondering if maybe you'd like to... I mean, if you were... I was thinking maybe you and I could- - Shane, stop. Stop talking. You're gonna get all nervous and sweaty and tense, and there's nothing worse than being tense. Now, you come with me to my room and let me do all the talking, because there are two things that I'm really good at, and one of them is talking. And if you come with me, maybe I'll show you the other thing that I'm good at is. How does that sound? - Sounds great. - Looks like you got the fuzzy end of the lollipop. Sad case. (Slim chuckles) (Samantha sighs) (mellow country music) (switch clicks) - First time with a man? - Yeah. - You're shaking. - Yeah, it's cold in here. - It's hotter than fresh milk in here, Shane. You're scared is all. - I'm not scared of nothing. - You're still a virgin, aren't you? - No. I've been with women. Plenty, in fact. - Lies. You don't have to lie to me, Shane. Now, come on, for your first time, I'm gonna make it really special. Now, you can take off your clothes, or I can take them off for you. Whatever makes you feel comfortable. Deal? - Hey. - Hey, handsome. - Must've fallen asleep. - Yeah. It's quiet here tonight. Haven't seen a single customer in hours. - Mm, great. Even though I could use the money, my ass could use a break. - Well, I was kinda hoping to do- - Oh, sorry, babe, I am closed for business tonight. - Business. - I'm only kidding. I'm just tired is all. Don't take things so personally, Jamie. (Jamie sighs) - Do you love me, Duke? - You already know how I feel about you, Jamie. You're my man. - Yeah, I know all of that, but do you love me? (Duke sighs) - I don't think a man can love another man like he loves a woman. - I don't think that's true. - I'm older than you, Jamie. I've seen a lot of things. And after all that, I think the only thing men know how to do is kill each other. - I'm gonna go watch some TV. - [Man] You. You out there, do you know what horror is? Smug, confident, secure because you are sane. Do you know what madness is or how it strikes? Have you seen the demons that surge through the corridors of the crazed mind? - Can't sleep? - Yeah. - Me too. Heard from one of the guys, your parents are gone. I'm sorry. - Thank you. - My parents might as well be dead. Kicked me out when I was 15. Found out I was queer. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I got the boys now. Guess you do too. - They're all right, I guess, not as nice as you, though. Do you like this getup? - What do you mean? - The nail polish. The- - Silk? How could you not? Here. (gentle music) Try this on. You'll never wear anything else again. See? Bet you don't want nothing else touching your body ever again. - Isn't Duke... - He don't own me. - I knew it. - Shh. - We should... - Shh, we will. (eerie music) (crickets chirping) (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (group chanting in foreign language) (footsteps pattering) (group chanting in foreign language) (footsteps pattering) (group chanting in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (person grunts) (ax thuds) (blood spattering) (insects buzzing) (crickets chirping) - Mm. Good morning, champ. - Morning. (LaRue chuckles) - Where are you off to? - I think I should get back to the station. Dwight's gonna want to skin me. - What, no kiss goodbye? - That's more like second date stuff. (LaRue chuckles) - Well, hopefully, I'll see you around. - Yeah, sure. Bye. (lighter clicks) - Morning, Shane. Did LaRue give you the long dong of the law? - You know, I could have you arrested. - I bet what you did last night was the real crime. (Shane sighs) (Wild Bill laughs) - Jesus pole vaulting Christ, can you keep it down? My head is pounding. - I bet that's not the part of you that got the pounding. - You wouldn't know it from looking at him, but that guy is a jackhammer in the sack. - Boys. Boys, boys. Please, tidy your rooms in preparation for the arrival of Mr. Wheatstraw at 8:00 p.m. Ms. Pearl and Ms. Olivia will be helping to clean the rest of the house. - As you all know, tonight is a very big night for us, so please, be on your best behavior. - Have any of you guys seen Jamie? Been looking all around for him. - Not my day to watch him. - No. Just got out of bed two minutes ago. - I guess I'll just head outside and see if he's in the backyard. - Yeah, you do that. (Wild Bill exhales) (door opens) - Ms. Pearl, I need you to take out the garbage. The house is beginning to stink. - Have you seen Jamie? - No. I'm sure he's around somewhere. - His closet is empty. All his clothes are gone. - Nobody likes a little sneak, Ms. Pearl. - What happened with that man from the first night I was here? - Take out the garbage. - He's missing! (hand slaps) (Samantha gasps) - Listen here, Ms. Pearl, if you are removed from this house, you will be out on the street. You will have no friends, no family, no one to look after you. You will be all alone. If you don't accept us as a family, well, your life won't be worth- - That's enough, Ms. Olivia. - [Ms. Olivia] What? - I said, that's enough. Now both of you leave this room. Samantha, you do as Ms. Olivia told you to do. And you, come with me. You have more important business to attend to than threatening Ms. Pearl. (insects buzzing) (crickets chirping) (eerie music) (people whispering) (people laughing) (tense music) - Scared you, didn't I? He's on his way. - Who? - This place won't be here in 20 years. It'll all be completely different. He will be the one responsible. (people laughing) - What is that? - Best not be late. (ominous music) - Mr. Wheatstraw has arrived. - I have a couple of questions. - Yes? - What is behind that door that you keep locked on the second floor? - Just my office. We keep a lot of our important documents in there, so it's in our best interest to keep it locked. Now, why don't you- - One more question. - You are a curious girl. - Why do you never get any older? - Where did you find this photo? - What are you two doing? Mr. Wheatstraw is here. - Mr. Wheatstraw, you're finally here. - Ms. DeWolfe, it has been thought too long since I've been graced with your beauty. (Ms. DeWolfe chuckles) - You see? This is how a real gentleman behaves. You, Mr. Wheatstraw, are a fine gentleman. - Is it hot in here, or is it just the company? (group laughing) - It is hot. Would you like a tall glass of something cold? - Well, an icy libation would be delightful. Thank you. - Ms. Pearl, could you please get Mr. Wheatstraw a mint julep? - Well, aren't you just the picture of sweet innocence? What's your name, girl? - Samantha. - Samantha. Well, I know we just met, but it feels like I've known you all your life. Ain't that peculiar? - Now, Mr. Wheatstraw, which one of these fine, young gentlemen would you like to have in your boudoir? - Well, to be honest, I haven't made up my mind just yet. So many beautiful specimens of the male physique, how can a poor devil like myself choose just one? Let's see. - [Ms. DeWolfe] Do one of these men strike your fancy, Mr. Wheatstraw? - Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. - Aw, hell yeah. - A fine choice. All yours. - Shall we? - More clients coming, so keep it up. - Ah, looks like my luck just changed. - If any of you say anything about this to anyone, I'll have you all behind bars. Deal? (rain pattering) (thunder rumbles) (ominous music) (thunder rumbles) (thunder crackling) (switch clicks) (lock clicks) (thunder crackles) (both panting) Can I ask you a personal question? - Shoot. - When did you first know that you had the gay? - Well, I don't rightly know. Ever see a table full of food, like at Thanksgiving, and before you know if one of the dishes tastes good, you have a feeling in your gut it's gonna be delicious? - Yeah. - Well, it's sort of like that, except with cock instead of turkey. - What the hell is wrong with you? - That's right, it's our second date. - Anything special tonight, Mr. Wheatstraw? - Take off all your clothes. - Whatever you say, Mr. Wheatstraw. - Now, boy, I have a special request. - Anything you want. - Those are my favorite words. Music to my ears, in fact. It appears your boss, Ms. DeWolfe, has something in her possession, something that was once mine, but I, well, nobody's perfect, I lost it. - Then why don't you just ask for it? - It's complicated. Now what I would like for you to do, and I will pay handsomely for it, is for you to go down to her office while she's in disposed, I believe she's keeping it in a desk drawer, and get it for me. It's just a book. A diary, in fact. Now I know a man of your skill could do this simple task blindfolded with one hand tied behind your back. Deal? - I may be a lot of things, but I'm not a thief. Sorry. - Oh, my days. I guess we'll just have to fuck, then. (ominous music) - What the hell is he doing here? - Oh, pay him no mind. He just wants to join in. Now, why don't you dance for us? Something real sexy-like. I'm just gonna have me a little bite, enjoy the show. (ominous music) (chicken crunches) (Wild Bill groans) (thunder crackles) (chicken crunches) (Wild Bill groans) - What was that? - It was nothing. Come on, we're just starting to have fun. - I have to get a drink of water. I'll be right back. (chicken crunches) (Wild Bill groaning) (chicken crunches) (Wild Bill groaning) (thunder crackling) (wind blowing) (thunder crackles) (water running) (doorknob rattles) (doorknob rattling) (Shane sighs) (thunder crackles) (eerie music) (thunder crackles) (doorknob rattles) (lock cracking) (thunder crackles) (switch clicks) (lock clicks) (thunder crackles) (lips smacking) (thunder crackles) (thunder crackles) (people whispering) (tense music) (thunder crackling) (thunder crackles) (whip whooshes) (Shane groaning) (neck cracks) (thunder crackles) (gentle music) (door opens) (thunder crackles) (light buzzing) (thunder crackles) - You have something that belongs to me, yes? Give it to me, please. - What's in that? - Oh, just a list of people who owe me something. You'd be surprised how many people try to back out of a bond and deal just because certain things are at stake. People like...
