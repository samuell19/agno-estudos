- No. You motherfucker! - No! No! - No! You don't go near him! - Please don't do this. - Take me. No! - I said jump. - No! No! - I said jump! Jump! - No! - Jump! - You're back in three, two, one. AJ? AJ? You're here. You're back in my office. - Dr. Avery. - You okay? - Yeah. - What did you see? - It's still too quick, but something was there with us. - Mm-hmm. - All right, put me under again. I'm so close. - No, no, no. We're done for the day. - Doc, come on. I'm right there, I just need a little more time. - There could be dangers in unlocking these memories, AJ. Best we just sit on this for a few days, we'll reconvene next week. - I'm right there. Please. Please. - Like I told you last week, we put up defense mechanisms against trauma. We don't really know how the system will react when we unlock the past. Don't rush the process, all right? It could take weeks, it could take months, years even. - Well, isn't there something else we could do? - There's one thing. Go there. - Go where? - To the place your parents died. Go there. Just being there, in the flesh for the first time in 20 years, that could be enough to trigger the full memory. Your mind, AJ has been protecting you against this. It's so important for us to monitor this closely. Okay? You know I wanna help you find what you're looking for, don't you? - Yeah, I know. Yeah. - Good. - Hi, sweetie. - Hey, babe. - How was your run? - Ah, awesome start to the day as always. Thank you. - Hey, babe. - Yeah? - Look what I found. - Mm. Wow! Whoa! That was the last time we were all together. Do you see that at the top? It's a Red-tailed hawk. It was dad's favorite bird. - Mm. - He loved how they'd do anything to protect their nest. They had this powerfully loud shriek. You can hear them from miles away when they were defending their families. He always used to say, he was just a Red-tail scream away. Man, do I miss that guy. - He loves you so much. And he's watching over you. They both are. I know it. - Yeah. - They'd be so proud of us. We finally have our own home. - Man, I know. - And now we will have a family of our own. - What? Oh my God! Oh my God! Wow! - Ah, congratulations! - Ah, congratulations, guys! - Yeah. Look at this. That's for you, baby bro. Yeah. - Wow! - Whoa, that thing is so sick! - Yeah, I hope it's okay, I brought along the sister and the idiot boyfriend. - Oh, pool time! I need a pool. - Oh my goodness! - Wow! Okay. - Case in point. - Arg! - You're only stuck with us for a week. Get over it. Good. - This is a little unusual for a baby gift, but hey, thanks, big bro. - Oh no, no, no, no. You don't move into a new house without a weapon. Trust me, you're gonna appreciate this one day. Now we gonna party or what? - Yeah! - Don't get my hair wet, okay. - Let's party, baby! - Yeah! ♪ They can't handle this ♪ ♪ So, they hit the floor ♪ ♪ Telling God that they ain't gon do no more ♪ ♪ In the nighttime ♪ ♪ We hit the streets, man ♪ ♪ Some folks be looking for the freaks, man ♪ ♪ When they get their swerve on ♪ ♪ With a pro, man ♪ ♪ You shouldn't hit, ♪ ♪ But you don't know, man ♪ ♪ In the night ♪ ♪ Some people love to bring the fight ♪ ♪ To those that get scared ♪ ♪ And don't know how to fight ♪ - Do you wanna get outta here? - Yep. - Right? So... Okay, so I went as Robin Hood to this Halloween party, because you know, I already had the bow and arrow. I was taking archery. And okay, maybe I had two or three too many that night. - Mm. - Yeah. And the girl I was seeing drops me off at home. And when I get out of the car, I'm thinking, okay, I gotta impress her, right. So, I say, "Wait, wait, before you go," "let me show you something." So, I put this beer can I had on the back of dad's car, right on the trunk. And I pull back, like, 15 ft, get the bow and arrow, I pull it and bajing! Just missed the beer can right. The tops off, 'cause it's a Jeep, goes right into the steering wheel. - No. - Yeah. And the horn goes off. "Mew!" - Oh, no. - Lights are coming on all through the neighborhood. Okay, people are in the windows and then dad comes barreling through the front door screaming. - Our dad's screaming, "Screw you Robin Hood." - "Screw you Robin Hood." "I never liked you, never." - "I never liked you, never." Oh, no. - I told... I never told you that? - Oh, man. Good old days, huh? - Yeah. - Look at this guy. - He was always a... He always had a way with words, right? - Yeah. - Lexi, do you wanna help me with desert? - Yeah. - We'll be back. - Yeah, yeah. - Something good I hope. - It is. - I think they got cheesecake, I don't know. - Yeah? So, you're gonna be a dad. Wow! - I know. It's crazy. - Yeah. - Hopefully I don't fuck it up. Right? Oh, you will. - Sam's been holding down the fort man. I mean, I don't know how she does it. - You having the nightmares again? - They're memories. - Yeah. Okay. Well, some memories are maybe best laid to rest. - Don't you wanna know what happened to mom and dad? - Of course I do. But, I care more about my baby brother's health, than what happened to my parents 20 years ago. - Look, I'm going up to Wolf Mountain. - Why would you do that? - The shrink says going to the spot where it happens, should trigger the full memory. - Now you listen to me, AJ. You let this go. Do you understand me? - Just one last shot, then I'm done. - Yeah, right. - Yeah. It's like I see mom and dad falling, but I'm not sure if that's real or if that's what's been planted in my head all these years. But, that's not even the scary part. - No? - No. It's the next part. After they fall. It feels like there's someone or something looking at me. I can't fully make it out and I'm not sure, but I know it scares me. Like an animal or something. I don't know. It could just be part of the cliff. Whatever it is, it's... It's getting clearer and clearer. I guess I... I'm going up to Wolf Mountain for the weekend and then I'll be done. I promise. - Okay. So, I guess I'm going with you. - There's my bro. - Okay. Lemon cake anyone? - Okay, that is not a cheesecake. - That is not a cheesecake. - No. Maybe a bunk cake. Lemon-ish. - Arg! Well... - You get what you get. - Yeah. - At about 4:30 PM, three men robbed a bank in Eagle Ridge. They fled the scene, but not before engaging. - Jesus! - Gunfire with local authorities. - People still rob banks? - The police are looking for a Hispanic man in his sixties and two men in their thirties, one Black and one Caucasian. The police are asking people. - That's enough news for one night. - There's my girl. - Hi. - Hi. I don't know, maybe Max is right. Maybe... Maybe I'm in over my head. - Max is never right. - I don't know, I just have a bad feeling about this place. - What are you scared of? - What I might find. Maybe I don't wanna know. - You know I support you either way, but if Dr. Avery is saying this could help and you finally get some kind of closure on this, then I say we do it. - We? - Mm-hmm. Oh, I'm coming with you. And hey, I don't know, it might be fun. - I love you. - I love you. Ah! Hang on, man. Just hang on. Come on, we're almost there. I got you. I got you, come on. I got you. - Piece of shit. - It's okay, you'll be all right. This is not bad. Just hold on. Just hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on, okay. - I need a hospital. - All right, it's gonna be all right. - I need a hospital. - Just hang on. Just hang on, just a second. - I say we waste him now. - What? No, we're not wasting anybody. We may need him. - He's gonna die anyway. - Are you fucking delusional right now? Are you hearing yourself? - Yeah, let's just waste him now. - No. What are you fucking talking about? Fuck! Jesus! - Oh shit! - Dead weight. - Hey! - Hi. - Hi, Sam. And there's my favorite cousin. There's my favorite cousin. Oh! And let's see the new guy. Hello new guy. - No, he's just not a guy yet, Ric. Nothing to see here, but. - Well. - Here's the little guy for you. - Oh, yes, yes. - Yes. - Busty. - So, remember to feed him twice a day and mix a little bit of his wet food with his dry food. Right. - And I brought some toys for you guys to play catch with. - Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. - Hey, guys! - Come on. - Hey guys. - Hi. - Vamonos. - Hi, Busta. - We gotta go. - Hey. - Thank you. - Hey, man. - What's up, cous? - So, it looks like a little family event. What, should I go and check the mail for my lost invite? - Ah, that's funny. - I'm kidding. I'm kidding. - Hey, thanks for taking care of Busta and letting me leave my car here. It helps with you being so close to the trail and all. - Oh yeah. No, it's no problem. You remember how to get up there, right? Long spree to Jasmine and then... - Yeah. Max knows the way. - Okay. All right, cool. Well, I love you, bro. And... - I love you too, man. - I'll see you in a couple of days, huh? - Hey? - Sounds good. - All right. - I love you, buddy. - Bye, Ric. - All right. - All right. All right. - See you, man. - All right. - Okay. - Bye. - Hey, bye. Wear a condom. - She's pregnant. - I'm not talking about you. - Who are you talking about? Adios. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll see you Monday, Duffy. - Babe? - Do you want any help with that? - Yeah. - Hey, nice boots, bro. - Oh thanks, man. Yeah, check them out. They're practically new. - Wow! - I got them at a yard sale. - I gotta get a pair. - Damn! Girl, you gon do me like that? - I told you not to bet your Air Force 1s. They ain't cheap. Don't worry, I'll take care of them for you. - What size shoe you wear anyway? I'm a nine and a half and your feet be looking big as shit. I don't want you walking on your tippy-toes and popping your corns and shit. - Oh, hello. Hey. How are y'all? Going up for a hike are we? - Yeah. We're going up to Wolf Mountain. - Well, there's a long list of safety protocols that I'll be glad to provide for you guys. No liquor, no campfires, no drugs, no sex. This ain't Coachella. This ain't Chuck E. Cheese. This ain't no-- - This ain't no English class. Clearly. Sorry about that. If you don't cut him off, he'll just keep, all day long. Y'all been here before? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, we used to come here all the time as kids, but it's been a while. - All right. Which trail are you going to? - Wolf Mountain. - Wolf Mountain? Well, a lot has changed since you were a kid. But still no reception up there, so it's gonna be just like the old days before we all lost our damn minds to the cell phones. - Wait, so there's not gonna be wifi? - No, there has to be wifi. - Yeah, no wifi. - What about hotspot? There has to be hotspot. - You're my hotspot. - Sorry. - Right. So, here's the deal. You get three days in there. You're not back by then, we come in, we get you out. Okay? Let's get your gear. Up here, in the back. - I got it. - Thanks. - All right. I'll drive you out to the trail head. You're about a day or so hike from the peak. You guys up for that? - Sure. - Why, yeah. - All right. Who's signing the permit? - It's that guy. - That's Ms. April, here. She'll get you all fixed up. - Great. - What's up, Ms. April? - Here you go. - Thank you. No, that's a lot of words. - Hey, y'all heard of the legend of Wolf Mountain? - Mm. - Huh? - This shit is real. They said there's a wolf man up there, he'll be feeding on young hikers. You're going? - And he hungry. - And you're an idiot. My God, he's an idiot. We do have bears though, so. - That's what I was telling you about earlier. But supposedly, there was a sighting of this thing in 1968 and some campers went missing. And then again, in 1998, a couple died here. Apparently their son witnessed the whole thing and doesn't remember any of it. - Just put that shit away, dude. Like... - Yeah. - It's sketchy, right? - Not, ah... Not cool, James. - Not cool at all. - What did I do? - Hop on. - If you guys don't like history. Hey James, get in the back. - Let's go. - Woo-hoo! - Woo-hoo! - Oh! For really? What he doing? - When you put out numbers. - All right, text. - You guys. Darling. Yeah? I got some stuff. - Hey, you signed for the permit, right? All right, I'm gonna give this to you. You can see right here, the out of bounds is clearly marked in red on the map. Okay? Up there on the trail, it's marked on the trees. Do not go in there under any circumstance. Okay? - Yeah. - It's filled with bear traps. The last guy who went in there, he didn't make it out. Ah, perfect timing. Now you folks are the last group before we close for some renovations. - You're renovating the mountain? - I'm gonna be honest. I don't think you should go up there, it's pretty shady. I mean... - Yeah. We were hearing all kinds of weird noises. I don't know. - Yeah, we're not too worried about it. See, we brought these two guns and they're good to go. - Ah! I think you need to aim higher. - Hey, okay. - What? - What the hell? - Yo, hold on. I'm sorry. - Okay. Okay. Hey, I'll take you guys back to the station. Jump on in. You guys be safe, okay? Be safe. - You're safe. - Yeah, all right. - All right. - Thanks, bro. - What the fuck is this? - My maleta. - Maleta? - Maleta. - What is that, luggage? - Yes. - You carry this. - I got it. Here. - Maleta? - Maleta. - No one told her we're camping? - Maleta. - Maleta? I think she said maleta. - Right? - Ah! - Come on, hun. - Come on, babe. - Why? - Sorry. - AJ? What's up? - Can you hear that? - What, the wolf man? Come on. - What? - Noting, keep digging. - My work is done. - Let's check it out. - Let's do that. - Mm-hmm. - Mwah. - Ooh! - Nice, right? - Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. Look at this. - Mm-hmm. - It was you. The kid from those stories. - Yeah. - You really don't know what happened to your parents? - Just ignore him. It's fine. - Nah, it's okay. Yeah, I don't remember. What? Dude, that is awesome. - Can you, like, stop? - He's part of a legend. - Man, you're just stupid. - I'd sleep with him. - Awesome. I got it. - All right. Smores anybody? - Oh, yes. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. - I want some chocolate. - Yeah? Okay. Mm. - All right. - Yeah. - For some reason, people connect the story of Wolf Mountain with my parents and I, but that story's been around for years, man. It's, like, when I was a kid, people would always talk about it. It's just a weird campfire story. It's like when people say they've seen UFOs, but it was just an airplane. It's definitely just a coyote or something. That's probably the animal thing I'm seeing in my dreams. - What the hell was that? Cool. - Not cool. - Max. Here, bro. - Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wow, that was close. So, what brings you guys out here in the middle of nowhere? - Eddie, where the fuck did you go? Whoa! - It's my friend. - Sorry. It's people. I didn't think anybody else was as stupid as us to come out here this late in the day. - Well, I guess we are idiots. - So I can kill him and bury him later. - No, he's just joshing with you. We're just digging a hole for our campfire. - Well, I thought the ranger said no campfires. - Well, we don't wanna take up more of your time. It's valuable. - Adios. - Adios. - What the hell was that? - I don't know. Are you okay? - Yeah. - All right. - Fuck, man! What are we gonna do now? - We'll wait till they leave, then we'll finish what we started. - Typical. - Yeah. I know this wasn't easy babe, coming up here, but I'm here for you, every step of the way. - I was told they fell off that cliff. And maybe they did. Why do these visions keep playing over and over again, showing me someone or something else there. At first, I thought it was just a weird crazy dream, but now, now I'm starting to see it clear. It's like a half man, half wolf, like the legend says. I know. - I'm sorry. - I know it, it sounds crazy. It's like I see a wolf's face and then I see a human hand, so it's just all fucked up. Do you think I'm crazy? That was amazing. - Yeah? - Mm. - You know, we've both been so busy, I thought it was a good time to break out Angela again. - Huh, Angela? - Uh-huh. - Who's Angela? - These. - Wha... You named your lingerie? - You did. - I did? - Yes. Don't you remember? 2015, that horrible Christmas party at your uncles? - Mm. - Yeah. You drank, like, 12 tequila shots and... - Oh no! - Yes. I thought you were gonna pass out like a light, but instead, you perked up like a little shih tzu. - Mm. Yes, I did. - Mm. Mm-hmm. Then you asked me to put my lingerie on. Daddy gets what daddy wants. - Mm, yeah. - Uh-huh. - Mm. - And when I came out, oh, you were like, "Ooh, Angela," "I miss you." - I did? - Yeah. But at first. - Okay, I don't know what that means, but I'm so turned on. - No. I don't know. - Mm-um. - Oh God damn, girl! God, I love that. Oh, that's it. Oh, fuck! Shut the fuck up, James. - Ah! Ah! Ow! But also, keep going. Ooh God, I love that. Goddamn, I love camping! - I can't wait to meet you, bud. Do you think the baby can... When we... - What? Ew, gross. No, the baby does not feel us having sex. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - What the fuck was that? - Max, Lexi? - Emma? James? - It's just me, it's just me. - Okay. - It's okay. - Jesus, don't do that. - Sorry. - Did you guys hear that? - Yeah, I think the whole park heard that. - Look. - Hey, maybe it's the Wolf Man. - Oh, shut up, James. Jesus! I told you not to do that, man. - I'm sorry, I got nervous. - You know what, let's just give them some privacy. - All right. - Okay. All right. Back to sex. - Gross. Yeah! Yeah! - We were just doing that. - No. No, no! - Sam? Sam? - Hey? I'm sorry, I just walked off to see if I can get some service. I wanted to try and check on Ric and Bust, but no luck. Yeah, the ranger said there's no service here. How are the lovebirds doing? - Still loving it up, apparently. Do you think we should go check on them? It's almost noon. - I need to get up to the spot, babe, where it happened. - Well yeah, we can go when they wake up. - Yeah but, it'll be too dark. We need to go now. - Okay. Huh! That's weird. - Why? - There's no one there. - For real? - Yeah. - Check the other tent. - Nothing. - What the fuck? Whatever. I'm sure they're around here somewhere. Why don't we just head up to the trail? - Okay. - Yeah. I'm sure they'll be here when we get back. - Let's go. - Okay. - Now give me yours. - How do I know it's still gonna be here in a week? - Hey, you're just gonna have to trust me. - I don't think so. - Suit yourself. - Babe? Are you okay? - Yeah. - Babe, anything? It's getting late, maybe we should head back. - Okay. Yes. - This way. - Babe, I'm starting to get worried. - You know the song, Free bird? That's Max's philosophy on life. Look, if they're not back soon, we'll hike down until we get some service and try to reach them. Okay. Let's go. Come on. You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Anything? - Nothing. Goddamn it! Watch this. - Okay. Arg. - You okay, babe? - Yeah, yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on. Let's rest here. Oh! - Baby, I'm cold. - I'm sorry, baby. I think we went in a circle. Are you okay? Fuck! - This way. - We passed the same tree we saw 20 minutes ago. Oh, goodness! I just need to... A second. - Ah, I'm sorry, babe. - What was that? - I don't know. Go check that shit out. - Me? No, fuck you. I'm not gonna go check that out. - Go check that shit out, now. - Be right back. - I'm just gonna take us back to the tent, okay. We'll cuddle up when we get there. - Okay. - Jesus! Shit, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What the fuck, James! - Dude, how many times, man? - Oh my God, I know, I know. I'm sorry. God, I've been looking all over for you guys. - We've been looking all over for you, man. - Where the hell have you guys been? - Max took us down to the river earlier and on the way back, I stopped to take a piss and I haven't seen anybody since. So, we should go find them. Come on, come on, come on. - Oh my God! - Mm. - Did you guys hear that? Jesus! - Hi. - Gosh! - Where you guys been? You guys left me alone. - Are you kidding me? You fucking left me. - You left me. - Oh my God, I missed you so much. - I missed you more. - Ah! Mm. - Oh my God, I'm gonna throw up. - Why? Oh, 'cause the baby thing? That's so stupid. - Okay. We're gonna head back. - Yeah. - To the tent. It's getting kind of cold. Maybe you guys wanna join. - We can finish this in the tent. - Really, Eddie? Wake up, man. Hey. Hey. Sleeping beauty, come on. We gotta... - How many times? - I know. - She's a screamer too? - No, that sounded like a real scream. - You think? - Go check it out. - Me? - Please. - Okay. - Honey, you okay? - They're gone. - What do you mean? - I mean, they're gone. - Jesus! - What the fuck is happening, babe? - I don't know, but we have to go look for them. Okay? Let's go. - Come on. - Emma? James? - Max? Lexi? - Oh! Ah! - Babe! Are you okay? - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Okay, okay, here we go. Okay, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Okay. Okay. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - No, we have to do something. We can't... We can't just sit here. - Okay, come on. Motherfucker! Hey? Hey? If we're gonna get out of this, we have to put our heads together and figure it out. Okay? - We need weapons. - Okay. - What? - Come on. - Hey. - April, this is Duffy. You copy? - You're ridiculous. - No, you're retarded. - No, that is ridiculous. - No, that's not ridiculous. - How are you gonna make someone eat what you eat? - Because, I can't. I don't like smelly fish. - Oh my God! - Repeat, April this is Duffy. You copy? Dennis? Anyone? - Yeah, this is ranger April, over. Dennis is with me. - You mean, you with me? - Yeah. Tell Dennis to shut it. - Copy that. He said shut up. I heard him. I'm starting to get tired of his old ass. - Did you guys check anybody else in today? - Negative, Ranger Duffy. Just the group of six. - Yeah, I ain't seen no one either. - Shit! Looks like we have trespassers who snuck in and parked a ways up. No permit. How far away are you from here? - We're over here at Wilson Canyon. - Shit, that's like an hour from here. All right. I'll get this party started without you. I don't wanna risk the safety of those hikers. - Copy that, Ranger Duffy. We're on our way. - Yeah. Duffy, we on our way. - I just said that. You always trying to start something. - I just... - Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh my God! - Oh my God! - Hey AJ, what's up? - Ric? Ric it's me, man. You need to call the police. Ric? - Hello? Ric, it's me. You need to call the police. - Hello? Hey man, you're kinda... You're kind of breaking up. I can't really hear you, bud. - Ric, you need to call the police. Hello? Ric? Goddamn it! Ric? Ric, you gotta call the police. Can you hear me? Ric? Fuck! Hello? - Move another muscle and I'll blow your brains out. You got that? - Okay. Okay. - Yeah. - All right. All right. All right, all right. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Come on. - Okay. Okay. - All right. What the... Ah, yeah. Yeah. Best cell service in the world. Yeah right. - Oh yeah, go. Go. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay? - Go. - Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

It's the 'cause I'm... - Rangers? Does anybody copy? Fuck! - Go. - Okay. - Go! - Okay. - Okay. - Okay! Why are you doing this? - You killed Eddie. What? You killed Lexi, man. - I didn't kill anybody. - Bullshit! - Why would you kill her? - Why would you kill him? - Freeze! - Get the gun. - Hey? I said, freeze. Nobody move. What in God's holy name is going on here? - They killed my friend. - No we did not. - He killed our friend. - Yeah, right! - Hey! I said, shut up. April, Dennis you... You copy? Damn, let me think. Okay. All right, everything's gonna be okay. All right? We're gonna figure it out. Yes, everything's gonna be fine. - See. - Okay? - Everything's okay. - Okay. - Now, what was your friend's name? No. No, no, no. Don't move. - What do you want? All right. I'll do whatever you want, just don't fucking kill me. - Was that your friend, who killed the ranger? Eddie? - Eddie's dead. I didn't hurt anyone. - Explain. Explain. - Okay. I found Eddie dead at our camp. I... - We found our sister-in-law, Lexi dead too. What's your name? - Joe. - Lower the gun. I'm AJ. Okay, it's better if we stick together. Okay? - All right. - Babe, let's move. - Okay. Oh my God! Have you tried calling the cops? - Yeah, nothing. - We have to try and make our way down the mountain. - No, we're hours from the bottom. It took us almost a full day to get up here. - We have to at least make some headway. - But, we'll be sitting ducks on the trail. - Yeah, she's right. It's probably better if we hide out in the woods. - Til what? You get an ax through your back or I get one through mine? No, we have to keep going. Do you know the way? - Yeah. That way. - Which way? - It's that way. - Come on. - Rangers? Hey? Hey, is anyone here? AJ? AJ? - What's that? - AJ? AJ, you're gonna be... - It's Max. - Listen to me. - Max! - Listen, you're okay. You're okay. We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay. - This is my fault. This is all my fault. - Guys? - It's okay. - Guys? We gotta move. Now. Come on. - Okay. - What the fuck! Yeah, that's one year of middle school cross country for you bitches. Ooh! - Geez, Dennis! Who taught you how to drive? - My grandmother. - Yeah, that makes sense. - Damn truck! - What is that? Run! Keep going. - No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh my God! Oh! - This way. - Yeah. - Oh fuck! Please. Okay, I can tell that you're going through a rough patch. Okay, but I know a great shrink, so you know, I can help you. I mean, not me personally. I mean, I can't help you, but I can help you, you know, help you find someone who can help you. Okay? So, you know, long story short, I'm a guy worth keeping around. Oka... Okay. No, you don't... You don't like shrinks. I get it. - Oh my God! Shh. What the fuck! My God!

You're okay. - It's you and me, motherfucker! - Girl you know, I'm trying to get married. You can't be... I ain't gonna find no wife in here. What's that? Is that Duffy's hat? Man, his old ass is always forgetting something. - He must have gone that way. Come on. - I hope he ain't dead. - We have to keep moving. - No. I don't think I can make it. - Yes, you can. Yes, you can. Let me help you up. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on, babe. - Hold on. God! Girl, we've been walking forever. Damn, I don't even remember the last time I came up here. All shit happened up here. I remember the last time I come up here, when them kids had a threesome. Locked they selves out the car. Hey, you ever had a threesome? - Come on! God! - Okay. Let me look at you. - Ah! - Okay. You're okay. Keep those eyes open, baby. - I'm so tired. - I know. I know, just keep them open. We'll be able to sleep soon. I promise you. Just picture it, okay. We go home, get in bed, cuddle all morning and then we have a movie marathon. - Can we go already? - I'll even bring you breakfast in bed. - Just make sure my eggs aren't too well done. - I can't wait to get home with you. ♪ Ba Ba Ba Bam ♪ ♪ Ba Ba Ba Bam ♪ ♪ Ba Ba Ba Bam ♪ ♪ Ba Ba Ba Bam ♪ - You know Beethoven? - Beethoven? I thought that was James Brown. - Oh my God! - That's not James Brown? I was about to say, wa! Hold on. April. - What's goi-- - I don't think I can breathe no more. - Are you okay? - No, I can't breathe. You got... - What do you need? - Where my inhaler? - I don't have your inhaler. - What?

That girl don't care. Her and Duffy. April? April? How she gon leave me out here with a flashlight. April? Hey, man. What? Oh, no I'm no... Dude! What the hell are you doing? We're on the same side. - And what the fuck happened to you? - I had a really bad day. - Freeze! Freeze! - April! - Put your gun down. - Hey, not a problem at all. But, you should lower your voice a little bit, because... - Oh, you think so? - Well yes, because there is a very bad-- - Why do all you men think you could tell us women what to do all the time? - That's a good point. But, there is a real bad... - April? April! - killer on the loose. Run! - There's a killer! - Remember Mr. Allen's biology class? - Oh, you're really talking about biology right now. - I'll never forget that class. And not just because he'd shower the first row with spit. - Hmm. - Because he led me to you. He made us lab partners. That changed my life forever. Baby, I fell in love with you while we were dissecting a squid. That's true love, huh? - Go! - Rangers? Ra... Rangers? - 911, what's your emergency? - No, no, not you. Oh my God! Okay... 911, thank God. Listen, my cousin's up on Wolf Mountain with some crazy, like, wolf man type dude. - Sir, have you been drinking? - That's not the point. My God, woman! Three people are already dead. - Sir, you need to calm down. - All right, sweetie. Stay awake please. - Look, AJ. - What? - Whoa! Fuck! - Max? - Hey, little bro. - It can't be... I saw you dead. - No, what you saw was a pair of boots. What I wanted you to see. - Why? - Well, that's a longer conversation. Why don't you untie me and we can have it. - In your dreams. - What's wrong, little bro? You don't trust me anymore? - After I find out you tried to kill us? Things changed a little bit. And Lexi? Why would you try to kill your own wife? - Right, that. - Hey babe, have you seen our toothbrushes? Like, I swear, I put them here, but I can't find them. Oh, what is this? This is the-- Max! Max! - Well look, I was just gonna kill you. But, then the girls wanted to tag along and I thought, hey, I can knock off the wife and the annoying sister, collect on a nice insurance policy. Why not? - Why would you try to kill me? I'm your brother. - You don't know how I got this scar. - You said it was a cooking accident. - The caretaker of the foster home, he liked to play this little game with me. He'd take my hand and put it over a hot stove, to see how long it would take for me to crack. He branded me like I was an animal. So, I guess I became one. And then one day, this fancy doctor and this fancy wife, they come in and they look at me like I'm their new son. And... And I actually thought we'd be this happy little family. And I mean, we were for a few years, but then mom got pregnant. She called you her little miracle baby. So, I knew then things would never be the same. You were the prince and I was just, Max. You were blood and I was not. It's like, I... I didn't even exist anymore. - So, you killed them? - Well, dad said he wanted to take us up to Wolf Mountain and I'm thinking, "Hey, I know about the legend." A little kid like you would swear he saw the wolf man. I could push them off the cliff and collect the inheritance and be your legal guardian. - You motherfucker! - No! No! - No! - Please don't. - You don't go near him! - Please! - No! No! No! - You don't have to do this. - You don't go near him. - Please. Please don't do this. - Take me! - Please don't do this. - Take me! No, don't! No! - Jump. - All of a sudden, the prince was an orphan, just like me. It's funny, I... I actually bonded with you over that, that you would know my pain. I think I loved you. But, then you had to go digging around for clues and... Well, here we are. And your hot little trophy wife had to tag along, like she always does and there she is, the dumb bitch. - Shut up. - Get up. Now. Let's go. - Okay. - Time to join mom and dad. - Why are you doing this, Max? - Really, I gotta explain the whole thing again? Come on, over here. - I had no one, man. You raised me. I always wanted to be like my big brother. You were perfect in my eyes. You did everything for me. You made me breakfast, you drove me to school, you taught me how to pick up girls. You taught me what loyalty was, man. We'd always have each other's backs. There wasn't a day that went by, where you didn't have my back. I don't know who this killer is, but I know who my brother is. I know he's in there somewhere. Why don't we just leave here together, you and me. I'll help you clean this up. I... I'll help you get help. Whatever you need. I just don't wanna see my brother go to jail. - You always did give a good speech, AJ. I'm gonna give you two choices. One is, you jump, which I like and then I let Samantha live, or you choose not to jump, I kill you and I kill her. It's funny, it's the same choice I gave mom and dad 20 years ago. And you know what? They chose you. So, what's it gonna be, AJ? Huh? The choice is yours. Jump. AJ? Don't let go. No! - Babe? Come on, baby. Come on. Let's go. Come on. - Just let me rest for a bit. - No. We have to go. - Leave me and get help please. - I will never leave you. Never. Come on. Come on. - If that's not the best looking couple I've ever seen. - Right? Hey, doc. - Hi, Dr. Avery. - So, a big day for you guys. The first time leaving town since Sarah was born. How do you feel? - I just... I don't feel right about leaving Sam and the baby, you know. - AJ, it's time now. Get your deal done. Go have some beers with your coworkers and go enjoy the space. How do you feel otherwise, AJ? - I'm doing great, doc. Still no setbacks. - Good. Very good. - Yeah. I can vouch for him. He's been amazing. - Yeah. And the nightmares are gone too. - Well, almost gone. - They're manageable, let's just say that. Yeah. - So, I gotta say this guys, looks like we're nearing the finish line here and you're not gonna need me much anymore. - Ah! I will miss seeing that mug all the time. - I am old and gray, you got a foxy lady there, you're gonna do just fine. - She is foxy, right? Stop. - So, all right, till next time. - Bye, doc. - Bye, Dr. Avery. She's finally asleep. - Mm. I love you, Sarah. I'll see you in a few days. - Great. Great, thank you. - I'm sorry. - I just got her to go to bed. - I'm sorry, babe. - Okay. - Aye! Ric's here. - Hey! - Here's my cous. - Here's my favorite cousin. Hi, Busty. Hi. How are you? - Dude, you know I heard that, right? - Yeah. Well, the truth hurts. - Thank you for doing this, Ric. - Are you kidding? It's my pleasure. I get to spend time with my favorite cousin and baby Sarah, who I can't wait to give a smoosh. Let's go, Busty. Come on. We're going on a trip. We're going to the airport. - Hey? - Where's... - You're gonna be okay? - Busty, come on. - Yes, I promise. - Okay. - Now go get this account. - You call me anytime, okay? If you need anything. - I will. - You promise? - I promise. - Okay. - Okay love birds, break it up here. We got a plane to catch. - Okay. I love you. - I love you more. - Bro, bro, don't worry, okay? I'm coming right back here to hold down the fort. I got this. But first... Oh, let's do an Insty pic. What up! Okay. Aye no! - Aye no! You knew. - I know you. You all the time, man. - That's my hashtag. - I know, I know. - Oh, #taking AJ to the airport. - All right, I love you. - I love you more. - Get a room. I'll see you soon. Call me if you need anything. You promised. - I will. I promise. - You promise? Okay. I love you. - Love you. - All right Ric, let's do this. - Let's do... Did you bring any beers? No. - What? - Did you? - Weed? You know, maybe-- - What? - Maybe we should stop and get some food before we... - Ooh, Taco Bell. Oh! We could get a chilupa. - Hey, did you see that guy driving? - What? - I think that was Max. - Dude, you're tripping. - No man, they never found the body, you know? - Okay bro, let it go. Okay, that guy is dead. That... That's like a 200 ft drop. - Turn the car around. - What? - Turn the fucking car around. - Jesus, AJ! - Just do it. For front door. - Come on, pick up! Come on, Sam. Come on. Step on it, Ric. - AJ, if I go any faster, we're gonna have to make a slight detour to the ICU. - Hello, Sam. One move and I will shoot you. - Fuck! - Would you just chill? She's probably just taking a shower or something. - Please, just fucking drive. - Ey! Goddamn it! - Geez Sam, what's up? You look like you've seen a ghost or something. Oh yeah! Do... Do you know it's amazing that AJ pushed me off the one spot that had a landing. I mean, can you believe that? - Why are you doing this? - Well, someone's gotta finish what I started, it may as well be me. - Please. We have a little girl. - Hey, look I only wanted to kill AJ, I didn't wanna kill you guys. But then, you had to join the hike and then the wife and that idiot sister and boyfriend of hers, you know, screwed the whole thing up. And so what? You think that you and AJ get to live in this nice house now and play family, while I am out there, looking over my shoulder all the time, like a common criminal? - No, no, it doesn't have to be that way. We can all be happy together. - I don't think so. Fuck! For front door. - Ric? Just do it. - Hey, little bro. - Sam? - AJ? - No Sam, no! - Don't move. - Okay. Let her go. It's me you want. - Yeah, but messing with you is so much more fun. - I'm sorry you had such a shitty childhood, Okay. But you know something, I can relate. I grew up without my parents and it was really tough. But you, you go through life, like, resenting everyone. That's the poison you've been drinking, Max and it's just ugly. - You always did give a good speech, AJ. - And you're pathetic. - Yeah, why don't you come here and say that. - Sure. Now, Ric. - Finish it. Do it! You know you want to, you're just like me. - No, I'm nothing like you. Oh, thank God! - Yeah. - I don't know what I would have done. - Look out!
