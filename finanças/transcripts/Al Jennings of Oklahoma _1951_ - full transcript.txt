AL JENNINGS OF OKLAHOMA The year 1863 was a turning point, in the war between North and South. The Union Army flooded the Confederate territory breaking the resistance only by the strength of men and weapons. One morning that year, a small detachment of southerners resisted to allow the withdrawal of the majority of the army. The detachment was led, by Major Jennings. Major Jennings? Tell me, sergeant! The enemy advanced 15 km to the south. They crossed the river. Your home is on the way. With your permission, I would warn you and evacuate. You have permission. After courageous but hopeless resistance, Major Jennings' small detachment was defeated. While the survivors retreated in disorganized fashion, the major tried to enter the main army corps. Cable! Did you arrive on time? Yes I am. They ran away at the last minute. Mrs. Jennings will be waiting for you at the old cabin on Big Rock. Everyone is fine? Yes. And children. And Mrs. Jennings? It is as good as you would expect. Martha takes care of her. Are you in a lot of pain, Mrs. Jennings? Yes, Martha. Will you reach the cabin? I think I will. Why doesn't Martha let us in the house? Because mommy is sick. It is not like that. She acted like the day she found you. You were too small. Where did she find me? In the forest, in a hollow tree. I must have been very scared. He's the father! Hi John, hello Ed. Frank! Hello, dad. Where's the mother? It's inside. Martha told us not to enter. Mom is sick. And Daddy wants us to stay out. Didn't I tell you? Child. It looks like he's angry. Hear that southerner cry. What lust he will have when he grows up! In that abandoned hut, in the whirlwind of war, Al Jennings was born. It was a prophetic environment because his life was full of violence. Many years later, in the small town of Coldwater, Kansas, Al Jennings had a law firm with her brother Frank. Their father was a district judge whom the community admired and respected. The judge was strict and fair. His wife died when Al was 11 years old. and since then he raised the children himself. But there were times when Al, fiercely provoked the judge. Nine o'clock. Your brother is obviously afraid to face me. When you are angry with Ala, he is always my brother, not your son. He's never afraid of anything. There is a big difference between fear and respect for the law. But he must remember that the court, and especially mine, it is a place of justice. He always had a sudden temper. That does not excuse him. Intemperance is a sign of weakness. I should stand by while he fished me out of Kansas City called a liar in front of a full court? Is that your idea? My idea is that you cannot oppose a person. As for violence, you shouldn't have assaulted a rival lawyer. I was trying to explain... Don't worry, Frank, I will. I will beat anyone who calls me a liar, inside and outside the courtroom. I should have punished you and let you cool, in prison for a day or two. Why do not you? It is not so late. Come to court tomorrow at ten. You will not do this to Al. No, they're not going. Why don't I go? Because I'm leaving tonight. What about our law firm? You can go too. Our work is hampered by the fact that our father is a judge. Customers come because they think we have an impact on the judge. We have to go. So? It happened as I expected. Did you want him to leave? No. But it may be the best way. He has a wild temper, but a logical mind. He has a right to work hard here. Perhaps they will learn to control their feelings among strangers. Come with him, Frank. Watch him. I will do my best. Your brothers are doing well in Woodward. Maybe you have a chance there too. Thank you. We can try. Woodward 4 miles, Oklahoma's largest city. You can let go now. Oh... I did not know that. I closed my eyes, expecting the worst. Crazy. You can receive the reins. To straighten you out, I don't know anything about horses. You have to know, if you intend to live here. I will not live here. And I don't like being called crazy. It's crazy to drive without a brake. It wasn't me driving, it was Jeff. Jeff. Who is Jeff and where is he? She works for my uncle. We stopped because some things fell. He went down to get them and the horses galloped. I don't know why I'm telling you this. Perhaps because you are grateful. You should be. Isn't it, Frank? Oh, yes, in every book I read, the heroine kisses the hero, when he stops wild horses. Well, yes! Will you kiss me now or later? I will not. Oh! Aren't you going now? Okay, I'll wait then. Listen, whoever you are. My name is Al Jennings. And this is my brother Frank, Miss. Naprzica. That's your name, isn't it? I should be grateful, Mr. Jennings. Both of you! I'm Margo St. Claire. Welcome to the territory of Oklahoma, where you don't live. Where do you live? In New Orleans. I'm here to visit Uncle Robert Kyle. He owns the Square K ranch. Do you know him? Not yet. And we are here for the first time. But we intend to get to know everyone. Good. I'll be right there, Dona Margo! Do not run away. I'm glad you're doing well, miss. The devil's horses are always running. Thank you, gentlemen, for stopping them. Goodbye, Mr. Jennings. Maybe I'll see you again. We will. You look safe. Because I am like that by nature. Your damn plagues! Move yourself! Hey, pretty girl. Too bad he doesn't stay here. Good morning, strangers. Good Morning. Are you going to Woodward? Yes. Can you tell us something about this city? You ran into the right man. I know everything about Woodward. It is an exciting city. It grows like a weed and is open to everyone. And what are the prices! Everything you buy is worth it. I hope you have brought a lot of money. Oh, enough. In that case, get off your horses, with your hands up. This is something new. Horse-drawn carriage theft. I invented it myself. I knew it would be a surprise element. Inverted March. Isn't it too slow to escape? Yes. But I intend to take your horses too. What beautiful animals. Do not try to lift it. I do not want to kill you. Nice of you, son. You are skilled with this toy. Will you bring me? No, we're in a hurry. And we probably couldn't do it, not even two dollars for you. I hope I can keep it as a souvenir. It is not clear. Someone always loses, in a bandit attack. And I will take this back. Good! I will go now, in case you agree. Here it is. Thank you. Yes! Do you think it's good to let it go? Why not? So I profited! Nice revolver. It may be useful one day. You got away with it, Al, taking the thief's revolver. He was not much of a thief. Does it look familiar to you, Ed? Was he a big man, with a round face and an innocent expression? That pulls recklessly. Do you know him? It's Lon Tuttle. I acquitted him in court last fall for a small theft. He paid me with a meter of wood. But did you notice that the trigger was sawed? So that she can pull with her thumb. That's how I learned to shoot .44. It is not bad to know how to film in this city. If you intend to stay. We wanted to talk to you about it. And we would open an office if we don't become a competition for you. You are not going. Certainly not. Lawyers are highly sought after in the city. I will take you to court tomorrow. I'm defending Bob Kyle from Square K Ranch in the case of the right to water. Kyle? Doesn't he have a niece, Margo St. Claire? Hm!... Beautiful girl. I know. We met her when we came to the city. Aren't you worried? Do we have a chance? We have a good chance. I will never forget it. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen. But it is ungrateful. She didn't even kiss me when I saved her. She is petty. Hello Mr. Jennings. In fact, two mr. Jennings. Good morning Miss St. Claire. What a surprise! I doubt it. You are right. I knew, that I would find you here. How? Your uncle's lawyer is our brother Ed. Imagine! Yes, a great idea came to mind. Why is my brother your uncle's lawyer so they can perform perfectly and we can see each other again. Mr. Jennings, I'm surprised you want to see a lunatic. Okay. I'm withdrawing. You weren't crazy, just stupid. But I will still see you. Unfortunately, you won't. I'm going back to New Orleans tomorrow. Hm!... What a pity! Everyone standing in the room! The district court will start to function. You can sit down. When we closed, you summarized the defense case, Mr. Jennings. Keep going. Mr. Judge, meritorious witnesses, including three civil servants, testified that the applicant had leased Mr. Kyle the right to water of land he didn't own. Now he wants to accuse Mr. Kyle something he was not allowed to rent. Good trick if it works, for you. Rent indigenous lands and the right to water. Complaint! The defendant?s refusal to pay his debts is a common fraud, on the verge of a robbery. Of course, I'm not surprised that Ed Jennings is a defender. So far, he argued, a select elite of bandits and also some thieves. It is obviously like a fish in the water in your company. Did you call him a thief? If the shoe fits, wear it. The shoe is blistered, sir. Order! Order! What is happening? That's enough, Al. I have never seen such a shameful scene in a courtroom in my life. Who are these breakers? They are not breakers, judge. They are my brothers Al Frank. Al Frank Jennings, He fines everyone a $ 50 fine for disturbing the peace. Excuse me, Mr. Judge, I question that. We were neither arrested nor prosecuted. I argue that this court has no power to punish us. Oh!... You speak like a lawyer. And I am. Like him. That's it? Are you contesting the decision by formality? Young man, formalities can be fixed. Sheriff, arrest them for disturbing the order. Violations, such as disorderly conduct, are not under the authority of the federal sheriff. Ken, what do you say? He's right, Your Honor. In this case, the court dismisses the charge of disorderly conduct. Instead, the two, at $ 50, for contempt of court. Will your brilliant legal mind challenge my authority? I'm not going, sir. We will pay. That's better. Take a step back. Mr. judge, I apologize to the court, for my brothers' reckless actions. But only for the court. I understood that. The plaintiff's lawyer apologizes, by the hints, that Mr. Jennings is a thief? I'm not apologizing. You have to deal with each other, not in court. I don't have to listen to your arguments anymore. I declare in favor of defendant Mr. Kyle represented by Mr. Jennings. The court completed its work. If you are not busy packing your bags tonight, I would love to visit you. I packed my bags, sir. Jennings. Everything here seems to be happening fast. I met you yesterday and an outlaw tried to rob me. Today I met you again, in court and got into a fight. I have to say goodbye, to you tonight. New Orleans is not a wall. He is known for his hospitality. It's true, but there is nothing there, for a young man starting a career. What are you going to find here that you can't find there? The territory is developing. There is enthusiasm here, opportunity. It has everything. Everything but you. You may also find that New Orleans is exciting. Thank you for stopping the horses. Goodbye, Al. Goodbye, Margo. I'm calling. Ful. Queens and eights. Four six. Get up before picking up the chips. Apologize for what happened today. Loud for everyone to hear. Stop! Are you, Sheriff? Yes I am. My revolver. I am going with you. Me too. Come on! Hold on, Sheriff. Jennings, get your revolver ready. They were arrested and disarmed. They killed Ed. Return your revolvers and back off. We will not solve it like this. I'm taking you to jail. You will settle in court. Save the revolver. Alright Mr. I am waiting, my day in court. But if a mistake is made, a new day will dawn. He didn't stand a chance. It was a cold-blooded murder. Marsden will pay for this. The law will take care of that. I doubt it. I am told that he is highly quoted politically. Is that true, John? I admit, he is influential. He will have even more influence if you release him. Taking the law in hand will not help. But, father, it's not... Good morning, John. Hello Sheriff. I heard that your father came to the funeral. I came to express my condolences. In between. Good morning, judge. Hello guys. Hello Sheriff. Hello Sheriff. I haven't seen you since Kansas. It was a long time. I'm sorry that it brought you to Woodward. I have news that you will not like. Tom Marsden went out on $ 500 bail. Did he go out on bail, on charges of murder? Let's be realistic. Marsden practically runs the city. Does he write the laws? This is not my job. I'm just following the law. I advise you not to lose your head. Your father will tell you the same. No doubt. My father is a judge. But if Marsden dictates the laws, I will not follow them. Listen to me. Be reasonable. Reasonable? Your son is in a coffin. Good!... I'll let you know. Stay away from Marsden. You warned me. You have done your duty. Let's get this. Maybe they will hear me. We will. But wait! Al Jennings, did you get there? Disappear quickly. If he asks for trouble, I'll be ready. I hope you haven't been looking for trouble. It's up to you, Marsden. What you want? Your written confession that you killed my brother. You are a real joke. Stay there if you don't want to end up like a brother. It won't happen as long as I keep an eye on you. Get out. You broke into my home without authorization. You know the law. I know him, so I know that bail is not for murder. Well, I'm out. You are going back to prison. Oh, based on what? Your confession. Start writing. You will do better with your right hand. Don't try anything stupid, Marsden. I know you're there. But what happened? We settle the score with Marsden. Bill Mertz, ran away like crazy! Let's go quickly for the Sheriff to hear his story before his. Hello Hank, ru I will let you know where I am. No, I'm going with you. You did not do anything. He saw me. He will include me in his story. Come on! I still can't believe that Jennings killed him in cold blood. I saw it with my own eyes. He didn't give Marsden a chance to pull. Okay, Mertz. I will arrest you and listen. Pete, Tom, Hank, search the hills and the countryside. The others, come with me. Look! We find ourselves in a difficult situation. Maybe not. Soon it will be dark. We arrested them. Your only way out is through this passage. Pete, Tom, go get the others. Did you see anything? They are waiting down there to try to get through. We will not disappoint them. We're not going to break shooting, are we? We would not be successful. I have a better idea. Hold this for me. Set up and wait for me here. What? We will! Get out! Mount and follow them! So what do you think? Let's take a chance. I would like to have breakfast. Good Morning. Good morning. Do I need anything? We rode all night and wanted breakfast. Perhaps a job if working conditions are favorable. Where you are from? Kansas. Did you even ride, from Kansas on a horse? A long story. It is more interesting with coffee and food. Let's eat? You have to ask the boss that. Where can we find him? The house is over there! You first. Hey! Tie him up. The boss doesn't like horses at home. What is it? The boys have just come up. On a horse? This one. They are looking for breakfast and work. Not so fast at work. Are we only interested in a job? If conditions are favorable. Ah, are you picky? Okay, guys, I'm going to talk to them. I didn't hear your names. Because we don't tell you. Well, it's hard to hire a man, whose name you don't know. Do you need a name to offer us, breakfast? We'll pay if it bothers you. Wait, Fred! That will be! Before feeding them. I have to get my revolver out of him. Where did you meet them? On the road. It was like that, I... hm, well it was like that, they told us! They wanted to take my car and when I tried to stop them, a revolver fired from my hand. That was my favorite. Now you explained something, which bothered me. What? Its sign is Diamond B. But bulls do have the Diamond L mark on them. Have you heard of buying heroes? Yes and you? L is easily converted to B. All you have to do is hit your seal and the meat is yours. It would be nice to work here, for a while. Hm, yes! We can leave if we don't like it. You will leave when I tell you. Can we have coffee now? Feed them, Lone, but boys should not lose sight of them. I need to check something. These people suspect me. She will feel at home here. Beautiful!... Let me see! I'll take it out Uma Well, well, guys! Look at her. Isn't it quite fabulous? Equip it with a bell and a whistle and it will take you straight to Kansas City. Ah!... He has good equipment, but how can he gallop with him? Now that you cut it, what are you going to do with it? But, I'm going to pin it to my bed. It will be the first thing I see in the morning and the last thing I see at night. He's crazy about women. Five blues. 12. I increase to three. Three more Do you like it? Yes, the food is not bad either. And your workers play a little poker. I'm glad you liked. You will be staying with us for a long time. Why do you think that? Because of this. What are you going to do about it? It depends. You are worth a thousand to me. But you can be worth more if you join us. It looks like you have two more workers, Mr. Salter. So ride tonight. Tonight? Yes. My boys, they are tough knights. They cross much of the territory at night. How do you get horses resting? Hm, we have friends. But don't forget. Lon, give orders. Aren't you going with us? Of course not. I pretend to be a rancher. Time to go. Okay, count the tokens and I'll trade them for you. How many do you have, Sammy? 14. Hm, cattle theft seems to be just extra work. And that is. But what are we going to do? He won't let us go without taking the prize. Should we join them? What are we going to do, Al Jennings? Hm!... We'll have it for a while. We have no other choice. When the long distance riders left the ranch that night, Al Jennings started a career, who became a legend in the territory of Oklahoma The resilient bandits went to the interior and always attacked suddenly! Postal carriages connecting remote communities they were easy prey. He joined a gang! Al Jennings immediately won the respect, of the gang with their boldness. He soon became his true leader. With each new attack, the reward for the Jennings brothers increased. Post offices in small towns far from the main centers they were victims of a gang, led by Al Jennings. He abandoned law enforcement, so he could break it. The authorities realized that Al, was the leader and increased the reward for your capture, dead or alive. No bank in Oklahoma, it was safe when Al Jennings and his pilots, they were on a campaign. They suffered heavy losses, with their bold attacks. $ 15,000 reward for capturing Al Jennings, dead or alive Is easy. As soon as they live close to the water tower, Slim and Doc will block the recorder and the driver. Buck Page and Pete, they take care of the passengers and Frank and Lon go with me to the post office cart. I do not like this. We don't steal trains. Let's try something new. All the banks and post offices in this territory are full of armed guards waiting for us. Hide until they relax. We are not going to do anything with it. You just stay safe, as always. Hands up! Is that you! This bag is swollen. And there must be 11,000 in it. It will be a profitable workday if passengers add more. This is like a goose tusta. Are you going to let the bad guys take everything from us? Should he help you? Bi. He's a railroad detective. Why didn't you use it? I'm a special agent, I'm not an idiot. I meant! Al Jennings! You stop, Pete. Okay, get back in the car. A little faster! I took the last prize, for our heads. 20,000 dollars to capture Al Jennings, dead or alive Extra prize of 5,000 dollars for taking Frank Jennings Good!... We have become, two precious citizens. Very precious. Did you discover something? Yes I am. With a reward like that, you can't even trust your best friend. Do you mean someone specific? Salter wanted to sell us for 1,000 dollars for a long time. I wonder what he would do, for 25,000. Let's clarify it for him before it comes to your mind. Oh, let's not! This will come to mind. We have a big booty. Come on. Maybe in Louisiana. Louisianu? They do not have an extradition law. We are safe there. We can even open a law firm. They told me that New Orleans is a beautiful city. Yes and Miss St. Claire, you are a beautiful girl. Is this combination missing something? Do not. It could be fun. And we might even earn some fair money. Yes, and we could take the train instead of stealing it. We're leaving tonight. "NEW ORLEANES" Gentlemen, like summer, the room is cozy and always as clean as it is now. It's the food! Good! I am a modest woman, but the food is fantastic. Clear. How much are you looking for? With food three dollars a week per person. We accept. She is here two weeks in advance. Thank you. Oh, if anyone asks, what is your name? No one will ask, but our name is Thompson. I'm Alfred and he's Frank. Oh!... Are you brothers? Yes. I am Mrs. LeClarc, at your service. Can you bring us a jar of water to wash? Oh sure. The maid will already be there. Thank you. If I knew, what to say to her! Who? About what Margo. She must have read about us in the paper. He's going to slam the door in my face. Forget her. I've been trying for a long time. But don't go. Good day sir. Good morning, is Miss St. Claire home? It's in the garden. When to advertise? But Thompson, a friend from Oklahoma. If she doesn't remember, we met when we stopped her horses in the race. Come in, I'll tell her. Are you sure he performed, like Thompson? Yes. He met you when your horses ran away. My horses? It's safe... Yes, Margo. I arrived today and wanted to look for you. Thank you, Teresa. I should probably be flattered, Mr. Thompson. Bi, you are the only woman I remember for more than a day or two. I heard that you are always on the road all the time. What brings you here? You once said that New Orleans is not a wall. You forgot? I remember saying that to a young man a long time ago, full of enthusiasm for the territory of Oklahoma. He thought he had everything there. Opportunities, emotion. His name was Al Jennings. How did it end, Mr. Thompson? Al Jennings is no more. Only Mr. Thompson is here now, Margo. He seeks an opportunity to be honest, for you. I would like to believe that. What about the law? They won't look for me here. There is no charge against me in Louisiana. What will you do? Something cool, whatever. Frank is with me. We would love to work as lawyers, but in our diplomas there are real names. Maybe buy some business. But if we stay, for a few days I hope you stay, Mr. Thompson. Ah!... Good morning, Mr. Thompson. Good morning, Miss. Calhoun. Hello Margo. Good morning, Frank. How are you? Oh, how many numbers, Mr. Thompson, didn't you confuse? Ah!... I get very injured, that's why! They are not when they are, in the right column. Ah!... The numbers scare me to death. But they don't scare me. Especially not as a measure of the dress you wear today. Oh, ah!... You look really cheeky, Mr. Thompson. Are you sure you want me to send this, for my dad as our wedding invitation? Why do you ask? I'm giving you a chance to give up on a bad deal. I guessed, didn't I? Are you taking me to lunch? There are many plans to be discussed. We will take our sponsor and Miss. Calhoun with us. We will get married on June 15th and we sincerely hope that you will receive this gift Frank joins me in filial greetings. Always yours, Al. Are you going to a wedding? Yes, I will. Don't you approve of that, Ken? When you ask, I don't approve. You were elected district judge, despite Al and Frank. People in the Territory trust and love you. But if they find out that you are, covering the whereabouts of two bandits, all of that can change. I'm not hiding their whereabouts. If I were hiding it, I wouldn't read Al's letter to you. In Louisiana, they are not bandits and you have no authority there. I know that. But an award was announced for them here. Remind them of that, when you see them, judge. Okay, Ken, I'll remind you. Tell them, I wish you the best of luck, until they come in, in my backyard. Good Morning. Good Morning. Here it is. I'm Hannes, special agent for Delta and Northern Lines. Are you asking us to collect? That's right. $ 600 for cotton, which disappeared in transit. Ah, exactly. I have the papers here. Can you sign them? I can. Yes, I'm Frank Thompson, the company's treasurer. Great. You can sign me here, also here and here. I'll give you a refund. Here it is. And expect the railroads to return our money to us? This will take time because the application needs to go through multiple departments. But you will certainly be paid, goodbye, Mr. Thompson. Goodbye, Mr. Hanes. Do you know who it is? Yes, the detective I slapped at the train theft. I'm sure he recognized me, even though he tried to hide it. I don't know why you hesitate. This job is no more difficult than Memphis. It is a different kind of work and it is not for me. Because? I just need a little help to get them across the border. Ah!... This cotton sale is just a cover. They were going to steal trains here, which I allowed them to stay. I only work for the company. Clear. And the $ 25,000 prize has nothing to do with it. Okay, I want that prize too. But I also run, more risks as I drive them back to Oklahoma. Getting them out of Louisiana is the first step. I will pay you well to help me. How much? Say... it will be 2,000. That's $ 500, for each of you. I'll get 5,000 and I'll give the boys the money myself. It is difficult to negotiate with you. Jennings are not easy products. When are we leaving? Tonight. Wait for me at eight at Harper &amp; amp; Royal. We'll be there. Another thing. The reward for them is for the dead or the living. Without killing. Clear. I didn't even mention it. I know. That's why I mentioned it. You are strangely quiet tonight. Something wrong? I've been thinking. Another week of freedom, then life in prison. With a beautiful prison guard. You're right about life in prison, Jennings. You will get it. And I still haven't heard of the beautiful federal prison guard. Who are these gentlemen, Therese? They are not gentlemen, Miss. Margo. When I told them, not to receive guests, they grabbed me and dragged me. Why do you call Mr. Thompson Jennings? That's his name. Al Jennings. And this is your brother Frank. The train thieves! Exactly miss. Oh my God, I don't know if I would be scared or excited. You come with me from Louisiana tonight. Both. We don't travel with police. We do not break the law in the state in Louisiana. And it is not our intention. There is no legal way to get us back to Oklahoma. You will not stay, even if I organize, a group to evict you. We will not! Make him change his mind, boys. Tie them up and put them in the car. I'm glad they exposed you before the wedding. I hope you stay in prison for the rest of your life. I do not blame you. Hands up. And don't try, Hannes. You don't stand a chance. Keep raising your hands! And you two! Should I send a maid to call the police? Not yet. Take care of them, Frank. I have to get out of New Orleans, Margo. Go away? After all the plans? We don't give up on them. But maybe somewhere else. And it will take a little longer. When I'm ready, I'll send for you. You said the law can't bring you back to Oklahoma. It is not true, it cannot. But the law is not favorable to man, for whom a great reward is announced. Hanes will not give up. They will chase us, destroy our work, maybe even pay to kill us. We are worth as much, the dead as the living. That's why we're leaving. Immediately now. They do not allow a man to be honest after being transformed. What I can't understand is why you came back to Oklahoma. It's pure psychology. This is the last place where the law will require us. There is something about that. Do you have any plans? Ah, ah!... We lost everything in New Orleans. We are going, for a big deal. The biggest so far. It will be the last for me. Are the former gang members still here? There are not many. Fred Salter is in prison for stealing cattle. Sammy Page and Doc Wrightmire, were hanged like horse thieves. I heard about Pete Kinkcade because of his health in the Indian country. Suddenly, he was poisoned by lead, while fleeing from persecution. The rest are me, Buck and Slim Harris. It must be very quiet here. Yes!... The territory is developing rapidly. They say that politicians want to declare this a state. What are you doing, Buck and Slim? We passed the property on to Salter's wife. We do this honestly. It will be boring. Perhaps you and I will fit into your plans. You serve. You must have wanted to stay here for a while. Is there a reason against that? Yes, it will be for a good reason. I don't want you here. What happened to you? My husband is under arrest for people like you. Mount and go. One moment, Mrs. Salter. Your husband has always welcomed us here. Yes and you He thought it best to hide the bad guys. It was profitable for him. Course is. It will be for her too. We won't bother you, for long. We will do a job. The last. But it will pay. How much? Who knows? But you will have your fair share. The money will certainly be useful while your husband is away. When you show it that way, I can... But I warn you. Don't get me involved in anything. I am an honest woman. Of course it is. It will stay like this. You know women. That's my suggestion, Sheriff. You will receive cash prize if they get caught, Mrs. Salter. But her husband has yet to serve 4 months and I cannot free you. You want Jennings, don't you? Of course yes. Then find a way to get Fred out of prison. With $ 25,000, I'm going to take you this far, from this territory, that you won't see him again. That would be very pleasant for me. Okay, I'll talk to the federal prosecutor. Tell me, where are Al and Frank hiding? I will tell you, when you release Fred. But be quick, because the guys are planning something big. And so on. Do you know any details, maybe you? No!... But that has nothing to do with my proposal. Okay. We will. Here it is, pure as the sun. We move the key, turn the train, blow up the safe and we left with $ 200,000. How do you know that they will transfer so much money? Mailmen like to brag. Especially after drinking, a glass or two. There is no mistake. The state sends money to open a land bank. Two hundred thousand U.S. dollars. A good sum, for our last job. You know your place, guys. Pull the keys and unlock the key. The train will stop here. A little faster! It's ok! Go back to the cabin. Lock on it. move on Who knows why we stopped? It is usually about money. Hands up! Hands up! The safe must be full of money. Open it! I can not. I don't know the combination. And there?s not much money in that. Don't make it any more difficult. Ammunition is expensive. Open it! Only the head of the train station knows the combination! This should be simple. But obviously, we have to use force. It is a pity to destroy a new safe, when there is almost nothing in it. Shut up! Get out of the car. Let's go back. It will be a big explosion. Something is wrong. Just a wizard, you can turn that into 200,000. Is that what you wanted? Money for the land bank? You are late. He took a special train last night. I said there was nothing in the safe. Yes. I will always remember you as an honest postman. Did you choose something from the passengers? There were only eight of them. 300 dollars. As you did? We found only 900 dollars. A lot of money went by last night. End now! They open and move. We have to be calm we just got 1200 dollars. $ 200 per person, including Miss. Salter. She won't be happy with 200 dollars. I can already hear her quack. I will not quack. Frank and I are not going back to the ranch. Where are you going? Escape from the Territory. This theft will cause a lot of damage and noise. Lonely, we're saying goodbye here. Do you know where you're going? Across the nearest state border. It will be Arkansas. I know. Are you sure you don't want company? That would not be good for all of you. You would simply burn yourself, with the fire aimed at us. You're better off here. You can also experiment, become a respectable citizen. Hands up! It will be a ride! Let's split up! Let's spread it out here. Raise your hands, Tuttle! Get Harris out of here! Is everyone there? Everyone except the Jennings brothers. "BORDER OF THE STATE OF ARKANSAS" Does it hurt much, Al? Oh, my leg. I can't move it. It is probably broken. Just take it easy. I'll get you out of here. Fortunately, we crossed the border. Yes Good luck. Hands up, Frank. Hello, aren't you out of your county, Sheriff? You cannot arrest us in Arkansas. Has anyone seen the Arkansas sign? No. Which label? He imagined it. It looks like Oklahoma to me. You were wrong, guys. I'm bringing you. The evidence of the prosecution does not justify the request for the death penalty. Gentlemen jurors, I point out, the death penalty should not be taken lightly. The prosecution often came back to the fact, that defendant Al Jennings once killed a man. It's a truth. He killed, but in self-defense. That man killed Ed Jennings, Al's brother... and my son. It is proven that Al Jennings did not kill anyone else. The prosecution failed to bring any witnesses, who would confirm that Al, or his brother Frank ever hurt any singular man during and on their escapes from this territory I ask that you keep this in mind, when deliberating and judging their fate. Now! Let us now consider the manner, in which the defendants were arrested. Formally, the two should not be in court today. Sheriff Slattery was found to have no authority in Arkansas, where they were captured. The chase, wanting to catch the fugitives, ignored the limits. Therefore, I repeat, the two should not be judged, for none of these crimes And especially for Al Jennings, for the murder. Thank you, gentlemen. You have heard, all the facts in this case. Weigh them carefully and return with one of the two verdicts. Guilty, or not guilty. You can retire. I can't take it, for a long time. There is an old saying, about jurors. The more they deliberate, the better the chances. To the... But if they set you free, we will someday... Yes, Margo. I will think of something. Take that message to the judge. It's ok! This will end soon. They are looking for directions. They got stuck. 10: 2 for launch. The territory will become famous if the Jennings are released. Tell them to pass, a wrongful death sentence. I will give these men a minimum sentence. But the charge is not manslaughter. Don't be formal. Do what I told you. Gentlemen jurors, have you reached a verdict? They were. Al Jennings is guilty of manslaughter, and his brother Frank, is guilty of an accomplice. Ah!... Silence. Frank Jennings, these court. I sentence him to five years, at Leavenworth federal prison. Get out. Al Jennings, this triennial. You are the first accused. You have terrified those parts for years. It is a pity that he has not been tried for all his crimes. The least I can do is make sure you don't do them again. I sentence you to life in prison at the Ohio Penitentiary. Your Honor, you sent us a message... I am requesting a retrial. The verdict remains. The court was dissolved. Thus ended the career, of the rebel of Al Jennings. But not your life. Five years after verdict of trial irregularities they warned the president. Theodorea Roosevelta. But he was forgiven and all of his civil rights were restored. He returned to Oklahoma territory and worked there as a lawyer. He was one of the main participants in the decision to make Oklahoma a state. "THE END"
