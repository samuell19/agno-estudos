- THE THIRD PAGE - So you didn't take the money? No, I didn't. Didn't you? I didn't, boss. I swear by the Koran. Didn't you? I didn't take it, boss. Didn't you? I didn't. Really I didn't. Why should I take someone else's money. If you didn't, who did take the fifty fucking dollars? Did I steal it, you asshole? I swear by the Koran, boss. Really I swear, I didn't. By my mother and wife. Fuck you. Are you trying to say I'm lying, you asshole? You'll give that money back. You'll die for that. Asshole. Pervert. Son of a whore. You get me the money or I'll fuck your ass. So you didn't steal it huh? You queer. You asshole. So you didn't huh? You faggot. You cocksucker You asshole. You louse. You didn't, huh. Sure you didn't. You bastard. I'm listening, you. Tell me about it. OK, in ten minutes. In ten minutes. Get up, you. Get up. Come here. You've got until tomorrow to find that fifty dollars. You'd better bring it or else. I don't care how. If you don't, I swear I'll fuck you here. I'm a faggot, if I pity with you. And no disappearing, do you understand? Yes Do you understand? Yes. Now fuck off. Isa what happened to you? Come and sit down. What a state you're in. What happened? Nothing. Is Mr. ?eref here? He's with the production chief. Where have you been? He's been asking for you for days. There was this job... Yes...? Fifty dollars... They're all bastards. Fuck them all. Don't worry, Veli. We will do best. Don't let me down, Seref. That bastard of a director... ...is never satisfied. Don't worry, Veli. Trust me. I'll get you have the best extras. He can't say anything. Let me kiss you, abi. Bye. Good luck. Fucking asshole. Thinks he's filming Titanic. What's up, flower boy? Who licked you? Perfect. Now you can play the lead role. When your bum sweated you ran away, didn't you? No. I needed a bit of money. Since there was no work here. You all worship money. Couldn't you have let me know? I was going to, but it was urgent... I can't listen to yourex cuses now, we have to leave. Guliz, are you ready? Yes Mr. ?eref. The bastards have fucked the place up. Clear it up. Be here early tomorrow morning. We're casting for a co production. Mr. ?eref. I desperately need 50 dollars. You think we're rolling in Turkish Lira, talking in dollars now. Whoever that bastard was, he banged your head bad. Take this and have yourself looked at. "Life didn't give me the lead role. No one is responsible for my death." What kind of person are you? Ought to be ashamed of yourself. I asked you kindly to pay your rent, but no. I told you to move out, but you didn't. What do you want? Just 150 dollars for a month. Four months unpaid. For pity's sake. Plus there's the electricity bills. You think I'm a fool? Mr. ?eref... Stop it. It 's enough. If it's too much for you, then fuck off. Every month it's the same crap about being paid soon. Fuck this rubbish. Please. It isn't my fault. No more promises. You better pay me or else. Your rent's cheap, but you cheat me for my kindness. Never mind the electricity but I want 600 dollars in two days. If you don't I'll beat you up, then kick you out. I'm a fag if I pity you. I'd better not have to come back. Asshole. Who's that? It's me. Isa. What's the hurry? Fear of your ass got you the money, eh? What have you done? You've shot me, you asshole! You filthy bastard. Is that for my kindness? You vile wretch. Is that how you repay my humanity? Call the hospital, say it's an emergency. Get an ambulance. Quick, I'm loosing blood. I'm dying, you jerk. Dying. Call the hospital. I'm dying. I'm dying. Help me, help me. Open the door. It's the police. What took you so long? I was asleep. You're coming with us to the police station. Hurry up. Over here. Over here. Get in. My commiserations. Thanks. Was he a relation of yours? My father. Good heavens. We thought he had no family. So he had a grown up son like you. No need for that. As if we are guilty... It could have done in the building. Have you found out how it happened? Shot with a gun. Strange, I was at home all evening but I didn't hear anything. Did you? Maybe they used a silencer. It's unbelievable. Keep still, keep still. Good for you. And then? I left the agency. I came straight home. I felt terribly sick. My nose was bleeding. I went to bed. I was aching all over, so I couldn't sleep for a long time. I dozed off towards dawn. I woke up with the police at the door. Then I was brought here. Didn't you hear any noise? No I didn't. No gun shot? No. He was your landlord, wasn't he? Yes. When did you last see him? About a week ago. He came for the rent, I paid it. I didn't see him again. How are you? Fine. You were lying unconscious at the door. Where were these photos taken? On set. Are you an actor? Not exactly. I play minor roles. Did you act in Mahsun's soap opera? Yes. A small part. I always watch it but I don't remember you. Who were you? One of Mahsun's friends. I was in 3 episodes. Is he really macho? I don't know. He seems a nice person. It's all here. Do you carry a camera around with you? What kind of a person is Sibel Can? I don't know her really. Her voice isn't bad, but I disapprove of her behaviour. A woman with kids shouldn't carry on like that. Do you know Ibo? No, I've never met him. Personally I like him. He's intelligent and good looking. And he's modest. He doesn't make people embarrassed. His talk's often vulgar, but that's the way he is. Take people as they are, I say. Have you seen a doctor? No. Why? What could a doctor do? Take an x ray or something. Perhaps you're hemorrhaging. Are you hungry? No. Maybe you feel sick from hunger. I'll bring you something... but don't get me wrong. I'll go now. You eat. Thanks. If you need anything or feel bad tell me, OK. By the way, my name is Meryem and yours? Isa. Nice to meet you. Don't get me wrong. I don't stand on ceremony. After all we're neighbours. I might need your help next time. You look like a decent person, too. Now rest for a while. These are for you. You shouldn't have bothered. You're ill. No, no. I'm better. We're having breakfast, come in if you like. There's only the children. Come on. This is Sibel and this is Can. I thought you didn't like Sibel Can. I don't but my husband does. Who did this? I mean your face, it looks awful. They blamed me for 50 dollars that went missing at work. Why? In this country only the poor are thieves. And then? The boss beat me. Didn't you say you didn't take it? So what, they only believe themselves. He gave me one day to return him the money. Have you given it? No. What will happen now? Don't know. I'll find a way. What do you think of the landlord's murder? Right under our noses. Anything can happen in this country. You're right. Everyone's caught in a corner. If you treat people like that of course they'll turn on you. You have to be careful. These are bad times. You're right. No one heard anything. I was out, but what about the rest? The man with the dog spies on everyone. They say they heard nothing. But they're just scared. What does your husband do? Anything. He's working in another city. Half here half there. Nowadays he's working in Bursa in a construction. Isn't it hard? Have I got any choice? True. I'd better get off to work. Which work? To the agency. You don't get work if you're not around. As I said, if you need anything just tell me. What is it? Come on, tell me. I just wanted to ask... What? Aren't you afraid? Of what? Well, you don't even know me. This is Istanbul. What are you afraid of? I'm not. Why should I be? Does it bother you? Of course not, you helped me. I don't know. Anyway, suit yourself. As I said if you want anything, just say so. Thanks. Goodbye. Bye. Open the door you bastard. Open up or I'll break it down. I'll beat you black and blue. So you're not opening, huh? That's it you... What's going on here? None of your business. Get inside and shut the door. Is this the wild west? What's the gun for? You're asking for trouble. Tell us what's the matter and we'll try for help. You fag. Why are you running away? Did we say something? Stop hitting him or I'll call the police. Go ahead and call them then. What do you want? Depends on what you're offering. Look here... Where the hell is the switch? What do they want? Fifty dollars. Shame on you. All this for fifty dollars? Call yourselves men do you? Shut up. So what if I talk, you pervert? Look here... Come on hit me then. Touch me, and I swear over the kids' dead bodies... I'll kill you. I swear I'll kill you. Come along. Tell your tale to the boss. Hiding behind a woman. Leave him alone. I'll pay it. How much is fifty dollars? How much is a dollar? I don't know. Let's see if the boss will accept it. Boss, it's me. We've caught the rabbit. He's asking whether Turkish money will do. OK. How much is fifty dollars? I don't know. I haven't looked at the ex change rates today. Don't worry we'll find out. Mr. ?zer, how much is a dollar today? 275, 000? It's 275, 500. Buying or selling? Buying or selling? Buying. Buying. How much is selling? How much is selling? 276, 500. 276, 500. Thanks Mr. ?zer. Say hello. 13, 825, 000. Right. We'll be back soon. It's 13, 825, 000 lira. You got the girl to thank, you prick. Shit. You louse, you pervert. Take it. Have you got 175, 000? Yes. Keep the change. Look Ibrahim I've always been patient with you. I thought you would understand, see the truth. But no. I warned you, I begged you. You got more spoilt every day. Remember when you were starving and homeless. Now you're denying it all. I can put up with anything, but I'm not going to let you... cheat on my one and only daughter. Not for that whore. Mind what you say. That girl you call a whore is going to be my wife. So that's it. You're wronging me and my daughter. So be it. You've only yourself to blame. You'll pay for this. Hello. Hello. Here's something for the kids. There was no need. Have supper with us. Then there's a good film on TV. We can watch it together. I thought we could go out. What about the children? We can take them too. I don't know. Where to? Anywhere you want. Maybe we could go to the park. Alright, after supper. I've got a few things to do at home. Then we'll go out. This is for you. Thanks. Say something. Does it suit me? Of course. You look lovely. Isn't it hard for you? How? Alone with two kids. What can I do? When will their father come back? I don't know? What difference does it make anyway? Why? He's your husband, the kids' father. He's no use to himself, never mind the children. Doesn't he care about them? How do you manage? Like everyone else does. I do house cleaning. Is it enough? What if it isn't, you have to manage. How is your work? Fine. There's an audition for a commercial tomorrow. If it works out, it'll pay well. They are going to do 13 more episodes of the soap too. Didn't you kill Ibrahim and his daughter last episode? The girl is dead but they will save Ibrahim. True, then who would take revenge on the girl. He's going to fall in love with our boss's daughter. And then? They haven't decided what will happen yet. Fuck them. The cheats. All they do is make up that shit as they go along. Do you get your money? In the end I do. You can't complain then. Thanks. We hadn't been out for ages. Goodnight. Goodnight. Meryem... if you want anything... Whatever you want. I'd do anything for you. Sorry, did I wake you up? No, I was up already. I've been calling the last two days. You weren't at home. I thought I'd call early. I was working. I wanted to say... As you know my father died. Now I'm collecting the rent. Do you owe anything? No. I had just paid him what I owed and the electricity. Good. If you need anything I'm upstairs. I moved in three days ago. Thanks. Sorry to disturb you. Goodbye. Start. I was born in 1938 in Erzurum. I'm married with three children, one at university. I was a civil servant for 27 years. I worked for the Highway Department. I'm retired. For four years I've been acting in films, soap operas... and commercials. In speaking parts. Do you have any dreams you want to come true? Why have dreams? We have them and what happens? Nothing at all? A house, a fancy car, a summer house maybe? Unfortunately. Tell us about yourself. How? Where you were born, what you do, what you expect from life? I was born in Maras. I've done lots of jobs, all over. Building work, street selling. I've sold casettes, posters. What do you expect from life? What do you dream of? I dream but... Yes? But dreams are a waste of time. Like how? You dream but nothing happens. Dreaming and knowing that nothing will happen makes you... Makes you what? It's no good for you. Makes you feel bad. What dou you dream of most? I'm from Adana. I'm 21. I'm a student in Istanbul. What are you studying? Business studies. But that's not what I really want. What do you want? To be an actor and director. Actor and director? Yes. Why? I've got some ideas on life and society. I want to share these with people. Like Yilmaz Guney. Like Yilmaz Guney? Yes. Do you believe in that? Yes I do. Y?Imaz G?ney was 21 like me when he came to Istanbul. Mehmet The Conquerer was 21 when he conquered Istanbul. Who knows. Maybe. My name is Isa Demirci. I'm from ?ank?r?. I'm the oldest of four brothers. I came to Istanbul after my military service. An army friend was the reason I came. Like most people, I have done lots of different jobs. But none of them for very long. What are your expectations? I haven't really got big expectations. Maybe in time have a family, and be useful for my country. Your biggest dream? At least once play the lead role in a film or soap. Why do you want that? I don't know. I think it'd be good. I'd like to know what it feels like. What role would you like? It doesn't matter. I'd like to play someone who succeeds despite all the pain. Someone honest and good. Maybe like Ibrahim abi. Do you believe you could act a role like that well? Woman, are you deaf? I didn't hear you. She didn't hear, she says. You fucking bitch. I've been working my guts out for you. And you treat me like a cur. Where did your work get us? Did you bring us a penny or a loaf of bread? You greedy bitch. Didn't you get money from him to live on? I did. Shall I tell you how I got it? What do you mean? You know exactly what I mean. What do you mean? Tell me then. Bastard. You know all about it. You turned a blind eye to everything. You sold me. You whore. You lousy whore. Die. Die you whore. What's going on Meryem? Meryem, open the door. Meryem. Please tell me, what's going on? Don't interfere. It's between husband and wife. Look at the state you're in. Why did he do it? Meryem open the door. Let's talk. Let's do something. I told you. I'd do anything for you. I love you. Please open the door, Meryem. Open the door. You'll get me into trouble. Go away. How's things with you? Fine, thanks. Just a minute. I saw you in Ibrahim's soap opera the other day. I was surprised. Once in a while I'm in it. At first I didn't recognise you. I didn't know you were an actor. I'm not really. It's just a job. Good, good. You're not bad. Thanks. What are you up to? I'm still not settled in yet. I need some more furniture. I go to the carpenter. I rush around. I go down here. To the set? Yes, the bus is about to leave. Good luck. Ibrahim is here, sir. What are you waiting for, bring him in. Welcome Ibrahim Bey. Who do I see? Ibrahim, son. You fine fellow. Let me take a look at you. I've got so much to tell you. When you were in hospital all hell broke loose. Everyone was fighting to buy your cassette. When you hear the sales figures you won't believe it. We couldn't keep up with the orders. They've been selling like hot cakes. All the channels are in line for soaps, talk shows. And two big commercials. Brother, could you lend a hand? Alright. Let's rest a bit first. Then we'll sort it out. Would you like some water? Yes please. Water? Yes please. No thanks. You drink it. More? No thanks. How did the filming go today? Not bad. This room is finished. Shall I go on to the sitting room? Let's bring the others first. Is that part cleaned well? Sorry to take your time. There's one more heavy one. Sure, no problem. Come on, that's my girl. Slowly. Don't jump, you'll fall. Are you alright? What's happened? Sorry I disturbed you. Meryem, what happened? Why are you doing that? Nothing, let me go home. What do you mean nothing? You haven't talked to me for days. I hear your screams. All night the sound of beating. How can it be nothing? Husband and wife stuff. I'm sick of it. Sick of it. What have I done wrong, what have I done, what have I done? Meryem, please don't. Tell me. I said I'd do anything for you. I'd die for you if you wanted me to. We could run away. I'd give my life, anything, for you. That's enough. I can't bear it any more. Is it true what you said? What? Would you do anything for me? I would. Anything? Anything. Would you kill him? Would you? Damn you all. Meryem To hell with it. Do anything, he said. You couldn't save yourself, never mind me. I'm a fool to believe a weak arse like you. Meryem, you're being unfair, what have I done to you? What can you do anyway? What kind of man are you? That's insulting. Let's sit down and talk sensibly. Fuck you. Cut out that film talk. Don't bite off more than you can chew. You're crazy? Do you know what you're saying? Is killing easy? Isn't it? You'd know better. What do you mean? What do you mean that you'd know better?! So you don't know? Wait a second and you'll find out. I'll be right back. Look. Do you remember this? Where did you find it? Where did you lose it? Where did you get that? I said where did you get it? I was there. How? Just like I said. I was in the landlord's flat. Why? Why do you think? Don't you understand? Meryem, stop playing around, speak plainly. It's been like that four years. I've been that bastard's mistress since we came here. He persuaded us to move to Istanbul. Put us in this dump. He employed my husband as his errand boy. I started cleaning his house and office. It didn't take long. In a few weeks what I dreaded happened. First he cornered me in the office when my husband was out. I resisted, I said I'd tell my husband. So he threatened to kick us out. I didn't tell my husband but I hinted. He wasn't even bothered. Whenever I mentioned it... He'd defend him. Call him a nice guy, a great guy. As though he knew, but acquiesced, the pimp. He turned up when I was cleaning one day. First he talked about being kind to me. He said he'd get rid of my husband if I wanted. He said he'd accept my kids. It was as though he'd reached an agreement with my husband. I asked how he'd do it. He said leave it up to him. I appeared to accept. What could I do? I was so angry at the other one. So what, I thought. They were both despicable wretches. At least this one had money, we could move upstairs. I could look after my kids. Can was still a baby then. Then he embraced me. I didn't want to but I couldn't resist. That's how it started. First he repelled me, I wanted to stop. But how could I? What could I do? Where would I go? So it went on. Then he started sending my husband away on business. He wanted me with him at night as well. I spent most nights with him. He started wanting me to do disgusting things. He put on porno films and wanted me to do the same things. He made me do them. Sometimes I did the things he wanted upstairs... and at night what my husband wanted downstairs. I used to think that they both knew. I wondered how they could tolerate it. Wondering makes no difference. He was as helpless as I was. A few months later he sent him to do a job in Bursa. Then he became more persistent. He said he was in love and wanted to marry me. He couldn't live without me. He even cried at one point. I felt sorry for him. Give me a day to think it over, I said. I'll tell you my decision tomorrow evening. That night I was upstairs. He came late in a bad temper. He complained about you. He shouted. Without asking what my decision was we went to the bedroom. In less than ten minutes the doorbell rang. I thought it was my husband, I was scared stiff. He said if he had left they would have phoned. He went to answer the door. When I heard the shot I didn't know what to do. When I heard him moaning and pleading I knew he'd been shot. I was terrified. I hid behind the bed. I thought what if he shoots me too, or the police come. They might think the killer was my friend and imprison me too. That often happens. I thought of the kids downstairs, and started crying. I thought of jumping off the balcony. But it was too high. And also I might be seen. I can't remember how long I hid. Finally the sounds stopped. I pulled myself together and decided to take a look. I got up and walked towards the sitting room. When I saw the blood and you lying there, I was terrified. I was aghast. I couldn't move. You know when you're dreaming, you want to scream you can't... you want to run you can't, you call for help but no one hears. When I realised he still wasn't dead I nearly fainted. Once in a while he trembled and made rasping sounds. I was almost out of my mind. When I had recovered I crept downstairs. I didn't turn on the light. Your door was open and the lights on. I took a look inside. I don't know why. When I got home Sibel was awake crying. First I calmed her down. I had two glasses of water and sat down to wait. There was no sound in the building. The police didn't come. There was no sign of the neighbours. It was as though everyone was waiting like me. I was shaking all over. I came to myself and turned on the television. I watched television for quite a time. Then I lay down. I was obsessed by fear and thoughts. I got a feeling I had forgotten something. Somehow I decided to go upstairs. I kept remembering the murder films I'd seen on television. I listened at each flat as I went upstairs. In one flat they were talking and laughing. I could hear Yildo's talk show in another. From another came the sound of a sex film turned up loud. I crept inside. He wasn't rasping or quivering any longer. There was blood everywhere. You hadn't moved. This time without feeling frightened I looked around. I hadn't left anything. I was about to go when I wondered what had happened to you. I felt you, you were alive. I don't know why, but I tried to wake you. I slapped you, you didn't move. I held you by the armpits and dragged you towards the door. I pulled you out on the landing. I went back and tidied up, then dragged you down the stairs. I took you into your flat and hid the gun. Strange, the next morning I found you back outside. I dragged you in again. How did the police find out? Who told them? I don't know I thought about that all night. Awful things came into my mind. What if no one looks for him, and he rots and stinks. Maybe his son called the police. They weren't on speaking terms. What's going to happen now? I don't know. What are we going to do? I don't know. I've been hearing your screams since your husband got back. So you know what he does? Yes. That he tortures me? Yes. That he rapes me? Yes. What can I do? I don't know. If it wasn't for the kids I would have killed him. Or run away. I'd better go, the child could be awake. Meryem. I'm going to kill him. I'd do anything for you. Ah, here it is. Red eight. What luck. Just one more I needed. Let's go. Good night. Good night. It's the same every night. We're here until late. Every morning my wife nudges me. But I can't wake up. Mine's the same too. I go this way. Good night. Good night. You curs. You got what you deserved. Ibrahim abi, please forgive me. Please, I beg you. Let me kiss your hand and foot. I'm not going to kill you this time. Go and tell your boss that from now on I'm king around here. Tell him in those exact words. Right, abi. Thanks. Everyone is free to speak their mind... on legitimate platforms, according to legitimate rules. Let all speak their mind. On the question of how to achieve an open society... again it was President Demirel who gave the answer. It can't happen spontaneously, but by talking... Fuck my luck. Acknowledging the good. We will continue on the right path. Fuck this game. You bastard, you fucking asshole. Let me go. Look at that son of a bitch! Why are you looking at me as if you'd seen the devil? Let's talk inside. Come and sit down. How are you? I got nervous. I came up to him twice, but I couldn't do it. I didn't mean that. How are you? It's not easy. I'll do it sooner or later. I know, I know... Actually, it's better you didn't. Have you changed your mind? Do you want to? No, that's what you said. That's not what I meant, but if you don't want to, forget it. No, I'm not afraid any longer. I got used to the idea. I just couldn't find the right moment. I'll do it. Why did you say that? I've been thinking about it. Or rather I'm scared. You might get caught or someone might recognise you. And I thought even if you escape... it's not long since the landlord got killed. And then someone else. The police might get suspicious. Of course no one cares whether he's alive or dead. But who knows. So I thought... we could kill him and lose the body. How? He gets home drunk anyway. When he sleeps... Are we going to do it at home? No one will see. We'll take his I D and everything. No one will know who he is. We'll throw the body into a ditch at night. In 5 or 10 days I'll phone Bursa and ask about him. When they say he's not there I'll call again in 2 days. When they say he's not there again I'll go to the police. I'll report his disappearance. And? This isn't a film. Haven't the police got anything better to do than look for him? Lots of people are killed every day. It'll be forgotten. You think so? What do you mean? Will it be like you said? Why not? Look at the things on television. What if they get suspicious and persist? So what? I won't talk. What if they torture you? Whatever they do I won't talk. It's no different from what's happening to me anyway. I'll just suffer it as usual. And I'll be happy knowing it's for the last time. How shall we do it? We'll wait for him to return from the cafe. When he's asleep I'll let you inside. We'll tie his hands and feet and strangle him. It won't take five minutes. Then what? They're digging the foundation of a new building behind here. I looked yesterday. It's nearly ready for the concrete. We'll put him in a sack and bury him there. No one will ever find him. And we'll smash his face in. So even if they find him, no one will recognise him. The police won't even have a photo to show me. I can't do that. I'll do it then. So long as the rest is done. The sack and the rope are ready. So what do you say? Don't look at me like that. If you can't do it tell me. I won't be angry, or blame you. I'll do it myself. That's not what I mean. But when did you think of all this? You've planned everything. What if I had killed him already? It's not that. I just thought it might take time. This isn't a film. Killing someone isn't easy. You haven't said anything. If you don't want to do it. It's not that I don't want to. I just wondered how. And I've told you. What do you say? I'll do it. What have I done now? You already seem to be accusing me. Say if you don't want to. And think of what comes afterwards. I'm not accusing anyone. Lets not make a mistake, that's all. You said it yourself, this isn't a film. Then say so. You've gone as white as a sheet. Do you think I'm a coward? Why are you going on at me? Why should I think you a coward? It's not easy. We're all human. I just thought you had changed your mind. I told you at the beginning. I'd do anything for you. I know. I'd better go. I'll knock at your door when he's gone to sleep. Who's there? Open up. It's the police. Is this Yasar Koca's house? Yes it is. What's the matter? You have to come with us. Where? What's happened? We'll tell you later. Get ready quickly. What happened? Where did they take you? To the hospital. Why? Apparently someone he was gambling with stabbed him. Is he dead? Meryem. Do you know English? Yes. Have acted in films before? Yes. Can you ride? Yes Can you do stunts? What sort? Falling off a horse, jumping from heights. I'll fall, I'll jump. Fighting scene experience? Yes, I've played a ninja. Got national insurance? Yes. Can you spend time from home? Yes. I can go abroad too. Would you play nude scenes? How? However. No, I won't do that. Do you know English? No. Have acted in a film before? Yes. I've had speaking parts. Can you ride? Yes. Can you do stunts? Like what? Falling off a horse, jumping from heights. No, but if you show me I would. Have you done fighting scenes? Yes. National insurance? No. Can you be out of the city for a long time? How long? About a month. Yes Would you undress? How? However. Yes. They say 20 days but it'll take at least 30. 10 milyon a day makes 300 milyon a month. All expenses paid, a free holiday. You're not listening to me. What is it? My relatives want me to go back to the village. Why? What other choice have I? Two young kids, and no father. Why didn't they think about what you'd do before? I don't mean them, what are we really going to do? You know where we live, what's going to happen? Why should anything change? I didn't mean that. We can manage. We'll work and make the best of it. I'm tired of this struggle. I'm sick of everything. Even if I forget about myself, what about the children? What will happen to them? What will they eat? What will they wear? When I think about it I feel as if I might go mad. Don't be offended, what can you do, you're worse off than me. I'm not saying it to upset you. Words and good intentions aren't enough. Everyone has to save himself. Are you leaving tomorrow? Yes, early. Maybe it's for the best. Don't worry, perhaps things will work out. Hang on a while. Take things as they come. They can't always be this bad. Isa. How are you? You've been away a long time. I called round a few times. I was out of town, I just got back. How's it going? Is it finishing today? Thanks Mr. Serdar. If there's no hitch it will. Were you filming? Yes it was a co production. So you've gone international have you? Good for you. Have they moved out? Yes, about ten days ago. Luckily they did, otherwise I was going to ask them to go. That's why I called on you, too. To ask you to find somewhere else. I didn't really want to do it, but two of my relatives need flats urgently. One of them has three children and the other four. Their houses have been compulsorily purchased. They've got nowhere to go and they know about these flats. I wouldn't have asked you otherwise. I know it's not easy finding a place these days. So I'll help you out. I'll pay the deposit and two months rent on your new flat. Then it won't be too difficult for you. What do you say? Alright but give me time to find somewhere else. As I said, I'll help. OK, I will. By the way, where have these people gone to? I've no idea, her husband died you know. Why do you ask? I just wondered what she would do alone with two kids. I don't know. She didn't even say she was leaving. I'll start looking for another place and let you know. Thanks. Good luck. Same to you. Brother, the door. An emaciated, harrowed, white face. But this time another beautiful whore. As in Orhan's songs. She faced me and began to talk. She said we need money, lots of it. She was going to hire a lawyer for Zagor. She would pay later. I'm a tradesman. By habit I couldn't help asking how. I'll work as a whore, she said. I could be your mistress. A lump came into my throat, and I began to weep. I believed the strumpet. That was 20 years ago. See you in the morning. Good night. I've got everything, Muhsin abi. Money, power, fame. Fancy cars, beautiful women. But that pain in my heart is still there. I'm always Ionely, always missing something. Wherever I turn I see her. Who is it? Who is it? It's me Isa. Why did you do it? What? What do you mean what? What's going on here? It's got nothing to do with you. What do you mean? Don't fool around with me. After all that we went through together. Why did you deceive me? What are you talking about? What kind of person are you? Do you take me for a fool? What do you think you're doing with that son of a bitch? Weren't you going to the village? Weren't you in despair? Where did this flat come from? New funiture, new clothes. Where did that swine come from? He was always around. What do you mean? Just that, he was around. Right from the beginning. Right from the beginning? What the hell do you mean? What the hell's going on?! Stop shouting. The kids are asleep. Look here, if you're going to shoot me go ahead, or leave. My husband will be back soon. Tell me the truth. Tell me the truth! I told you everything before. Only not about him. We met at his fathers office. We fell in love at first sight. He hated his father. When our affair began we decided to kill him. We were going to do it the evening you came. I let him in before his father arrived. Serdar was waiting on the bedroom balcony. We were going to kill him in the bathroom. But you came. That's fate for you. The rest is as I told you. What about me? What did you want from me? "To the defeated, to the forgotten and to Ajlan Aktug" Oguz why did you come? Why did you want ask for that? I submitted to my fate. You can't give in to fate Ayse. I did it for my mother. What my sister couldn't do... what she couldn't give I gave to her. My mother suffered a lot to raise us. You're lying, Ayse. You wanted a comfortable life. And you got it. I didn't have the money Hayri Bey had. I couldn't give you jewellery and fine houses. I only had a life full of love to give you. No Oguz. You promised me nothing. You didn't ask me to wait for you. Ayse where are you? I loved you Oguz, I loved you. Are those your last words Ayse?
