Mrs. Scheerer! Mrs. Scheerer, this way! - Is that your son? Do you have news? Are there any developments? A photo for our readers. A photo, please. Mrs. Scheerer, look this way, please. I never knew what fear is. Or what it does to you. I used to think, you'd always be there, anyway. And would take care of me. When I was little, you said, "We're so close, you can't squeeze a stamp between us." But that was long before. Back when you'd read me a spooky story. WE ARE NEXT OF KIN So, what do we have? Gerunds and conflation. What does that mean? Who can read my handwriting? Could you read that to us? Talking when you're eating. Dreaming he's traveling... Very good. - No. It's much too big. Do you have something to share with us, Johann? Sorry. The Evening News shows pictures That ain't even black and white Everything's true on the Evening News Keep it out of my sight I prefer them horror flicks They use ketchup for blood And rubber for intestines The brains are made of crud Censor the Evening News for once Censor the Evening News Am kah/en Aste? What's that? A mountain or something. Sounds cool. - In the Central Uplands, I think. But shouldn't it be Asten with an "n?" You know? I think just "e" is cooler. Noidea. We need something more modern, like "Revenge." I could go for Am kleinen Asten. AKA. Am kahlen Aste. As the abbreviation. Am kahlen Aste... - Here comes A.K.A. I like A.K.A. Good boy, Franz. Hungry? - Nope. Kathrin will be late. She just called. Let's go over again, huh? Let's take a look. Nor shall I serve? - No, think about it. Nor shall it serve me. Now you're guessing. 'Servitio' is not a verb. Nor was slavery allowed. Dative or ablative? Nor was I allowed to get out of... Why is it like getting blood from a stone? Doesn't it interest you? They've been dead for 2000 years. But they were people. And Virgil, Virgil fought for something. Here. Look. When he was your age, he attended a school of rhetoric. Good for him. - He was an outsider. Shy, sickly, mocked during his first public speech. His family's land was forcibly expropriated because Augustus' veterans had returned from the war. So what does Virgil do? He writes. Ten simple pastoral poems, but they make him famous. He finds a backer, buys back the property... Stop it. I know you know it all. It's not about my knowing it all. Oh, really? I'm trying to explain to you how what we're talking about is alive and relevant to us. To you, maybe. Not me. I just need a D tomorrow. I can manage. No, you can't, or we wouldn't be here. Fine. We're done. When's the test? First period. You'll make it. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Come on. Johann, look. Virgil is describing Aeneas. How he leaves the burning Troy, and sails west with his companions. Thanks, but... I don't need it. - You'll have time over Easter. Please read it. Why? - It means a lot to me. Maybe you'll see what I mean. I already did. I'm not reading it. Please do as I ask. You always have the say! Johann, we let you do... The woman got the house and he had to leave, so he tried to set it on fire twice. He was in our closed ward for six months. He improved in recent weeks, I approved his release. He got out this morning. What did he go and do? He got a can of gas and tried to burn the house down. No! The fire department saved the day. Can I leave the table? Did you argue? Heavy-going? Let's see how he does tomorrow. A lot left to do? Another hour? I'm going over for a moment. The Latin test! Johann? We have to master an adventure together. Jan Philipp has been kidnapped. When I noticed he wasn't here last night, I called his place. He didn't answer. I went over to his house. It was dark. I came back. You woke up briefly. Remember? I went back over. Only then did I see a note on the low wall at the entrance. But I couldn't read what was on it. There was a hand grenade on top of it. I called Christian in Frankfurt. He told me to go back over and lift it very gently. I couldn't make out the size of the ransom at first. I had to count the zeros first. Twenty million marks. He's got a temperature. Yes, on his face. It looks like mumps to me. He'll bring a note. Good bye. Hamburg Police. We're the next-of-kin counselors. I'm sorry about it all. Hello. This is Johann. Our son. I'm Vera. Please address us with our cover names. I'm Nickel. So far, we've ascertained the following: Two men overpowered your husband in front of his house. They took him through the park to a vehicle on Falkentaler Way. Why two men? There are marks indicative of dragging. One man wouldn't have managed. Forgive me the question, but do the two of you live separately? No. So people call you at this number? Yes. We'd like to record the perpetrators when they call you. Do you consent? Our lawyer is on his way. I'll call him. Mrs. Scheerer? Use mine so your line remains free. Kathrin, how are you? There's no hurry, but Osthoff wants a word when you're ready. Who? - The Task Force head. I just saw him. We will record all calls without exception, the duration being until safe release has been established. We will intercept all your letters at Altona mail distribution center, giving us a time advantage, since mail delivery is slower. We will not open letters from addresses of friends, relatives, etc. Mrs. Scheerer and I agreed I'll conduct talks with the perpetrators. Well, fine. I understand. Though my experience says one of us should do it. We'll see. In any case, we'll practice first. Thanks, but I'm good at improvising. An unrehearsed telephone call won't get us far. "Codeword, sign of life, drop-off..." They'll hear at once that the police is behind this. You don't have to use it verbatim. Johann, could you take Franz outside? Come on. Franz, come here! Is the boy's presence throughout important to you? What do you mean? We're also here to protect you. - Easy now. They want to do business, not invade your home. That's my parents' bedroom. Here's the guest room. This is my mother's study. It has a phone. The other two don't. This is my room. No phone. May I? Is there an alarm system? No. That's my father's house. You really live in two houses? He works there. He's got loads of books. They wouldn't fit here. Is there a key? I don't think so. Who are they talking to? Rainer Osthoff. The head of the Task Force. Our boss. There are many sectors. Not just Vera's and mine. Want to say hello? Nope. I was going to be a bike racer. But I'm 6 foot 3 and stocky. No way. So I joined the police: Mobile Task Force. I did perpetrator communication. Vera was my instructor. He's a legend. He negotiated with Dagobert, the department store blackmailer. You dealt with Dagobert? - Over the phone, yes. He repeatedly evaded arrest. One officer even slipped on a banana skin. There are many rumors. So how was it really? - There were 15 of us on the core team. Soon it was 200. Finally 2000. 2000? Cell phones didn't yet exist, so we observed every phone booth and caught him making a call. Bull's-eye. Are you going home tonight? - It's better we're here if there's a call. Here in the house? Do you mind if we stay here? By the telephone in the dining room? No. Do you need a blanket? Or two? Thanks. We came equipped. Thanks, kid. - Johann. Thanks, Johann. Thanks. You're welcome. Twenty million. Do we have that much? Is it a sack full or a plastic bag? Go to sleep now. Who will give them the money? You? The police say a professional drop-off is the key factor in a release. It's not clear if I'll do it, or Schwenn or a police officer. S0 if they send a letter today, it'll arrive tomorrow morning. And then forty-eight hours, two days, until they release him? Making a total of three days. Meaning... Friday at the earliest. Or Saturday. We have to be patient. I really believe everything will be fine. Don't you? Do you think Christian can come? I called him. He's on his way. Cordelia sends her love. She stayed in Frankfurt to write. The book is due out in autumn. Come settle in. Want something to drink? - Yes, please. Johann left this out for you. Matterhorn! He does sit-ups every day. - While I sit at my desk. Christian Schneider. - I counsel next of kin. You're with Social Services? - No. The police. I'll say hi tomorrow. Want one? Thanks, I quit. I'm glad you're here. Like this, and then... voilé! I'll get it. Where did you park your car last night? Approximately here. And the plates? - What for? So my colleagues are informed. It was for you. Tobias. I said not right now. What's up? Got visitors or something? And how are your mumps? OK? I changed the band logo. The monster is different. Is it good? Cool. I have to go. I'll look at it tonight and let you know. Bye. Bye. A letter from the perpetrators was intercepted in Altona at 08:15. It's 9:30. - Forensics are checking it. Can't they Xerox it first? Thanks. See you. Oh my God. Shall we go out for a bit? Downtown? Right. Are we just looking or do we check the sound? Here you go... — Thanks. What do you think was on the Polaroid? Jan Philipp. Maybe holding today's paper. Yesterday's. Right. It's what they do. To prove he's still alive. The hand grenade. Did you see it? I heard it was real. While Schwenn was on the phone. But that's not the idea: you eavesdropping on Schwenn, huh? I wasn't. He was just loud. Your turn to be loud. I can handle it. Listen, "We want Ann Kathrin Scheerer to do the hand-over in person." Then we'll accompany you. - They didn't mention that. I can only offer to join you. It's a lot of money to carry. An officer should join her instead of you. One who looks like you. I doubt you'll find a candidate among your officers. Our people know how to deal with perpetrators. That's the point. Our interests differ. Your focal point is the investigation. Ours is the life of my client. It could be dangerous. We must safeguard Mrs. Scheerer. I get that. What I don't get is: "If you are prepared to pay the ransom as demanded, place an ad in the Hamburg Morning Post under Miscellaneous Greetings. How do we do that? - They're close if they read a Hamburg paper. It's sold at every station nationwide. Editorial deadline is 3 p.m. Thirty minutes later for us. I have the number. - I'll do the drop-off. I prefer it to just sitting here. We have a psychologist, Mrs. Brockmann. I'll call her. I want to be informed about everything that's being planned or discussed in the background. None of it may jeopardize my husband's life. I understand. What do you say? Can Mr. Schwenn accompany me to the drop-off? If the perpetrators agree. How are we to know that? - We'll mention it in our ad. "Regards to Ann Kathrin. Drop a line. Plus a fax number. We have a machine on its way. We can't just write, "I'm bringing someone along." It's understandable that you don't want to drive alone. If we formulate it as a question, we'll give the perpetrators the feeling they're in control. I'll make some suggestions, you check them, and tomorrow it's in the paper. Ag reed. Thank you, Claudia. Sure. The envelope contained a letter from Jan Philipp to the two of us. What about the picture? Can I see it? - Not now. Why not? - It's awful. It's of Jan Philipp. He's helpless, exhausted and it's a shitty shot. Is it really from him? There. His signature. - "Fi|im." Only you and I know what you used to call him. Can you read it? "Dear Kathrin, dear Johann, I don't know what will happen, and less still how long I'll have light to write by. I haven't heard from my kidnappers in hours. Maybe they've abandoned me here, wherever here might be, and I'll end up like In jun Joe in Tom Sawyer. I only want to tell you how much I love you both and look back with love and happiness at every moment of our life together. Yours, Fi|im." "The mouth of the cave was up the hillside and had an opening shaped like the capital letter A. Its massive iron door stood unbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an ice-house..." A chamber. That's good. Good how? No, I mean, good... Better than a box. He's got enough room, he can write. Maybe he even has a table and chair. And light. - Sounds comfy. No, but you know what I mean. "and saw the broad Mississippi... "rolling by." Ring a bell? Maybe he's writing about his feelings and there's no concealed lead. Maybe someplace, a cave... No, that's nonsense. We just read the book together. Describe the situation back then. It was in bed at night, before going to sleep. I remember it was spooky, but I liked it. What? That it was spooky? Yeah. It's like in a storm. You know you won't get hurt because you're inside. It's been a while since I read it. What happens to In jun Joe in the end? He dies of thirst. Here. It's from Tobi. It was hanging on the door. AM KAHLEN AS TE Hello, I'm Nicole. She's just filling in. She's not really going to sing, don't worry. You suck, Tobi. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. We miss you and... - It's not the same without you. That's right. I'm writing a letter to my girlfriend I'm writing it for the tenth time I'm writing a letter to my girlfriend "Use your husband's Volvo for the drop-off. Install a flashing orange light on its roof. Put the money in a nylon bag with a carry strap. We will abort at once if you are followed by a helicopter or unmarked car. Be on standby as of tonight. You are in no danger if you do as we say. We agree to you being accompanied." - That's good. Really good. We have police mechanics in Bahrenfeld. It's safe there and only 15 minutes away. They'll install GPS in the Volvo there. The money won't be here? - No. We'll take it from the bank to Bahrenfeld It'll arrive along with you. We're going, too? I thought we were waiting here. A police car disguised as a taxi will bring you there. It's important that you trust us. Or we won't get where we need to. I'll put them here for you. If you can't sleep, take one. It's important for me to do this. You understand? I want to be there to make sure everything works out. Did they give you a gun? No. We won't need one. Anyone want to watch Harald Schmidt with me? I like him. That's a new look you have there. And was there a reason you cropped it? So is this your real hair color? Or that fantastic blonde it used to be? Hello, yes, I hear you. No, I can't understand. You must speak more clearly. I only got "40 minutes." Highway exit Bahrenfeld. Let me repeat that. - Osdorfer Way and GrUnewa/d Street. You have 40 minutes. What took them so long? - That's just how it is... Just stick to the plan. But they're 15 minutes late! Yeah, I noticed. Thank you. Did it work out? They didn't show. How come? I don't know. We were late from the start. The police cab didn't show. If it's not against your regulations, then be a dear and step on it! They brought us to a base that was so far away. Despite our escort, we lost even more time. We were like undercover agents getting into the doctored Volvo. But we couldn't, it was still being wired. Sorry. Let me get these. By the time we set off, our 40 minutes were almost over. There is no Osdorfer Way and Grilnewald Street. There's just a path closed to traffic. No one had told us. We looked for the electrical box with the letter. Here, I've got it! We're to take A7 to Maschener Junction with the flashing light. When we see another car with a flashing light we're to put the money in it. But we don't see a car with a flashing light. There wasn't one. The recordings shed no light on why the cab was late. May I? He left too late. I apologize. It's unacceptable. We didn't intend any delay. - That would be even better. Mrs. Scheerer and I think the car and the money must be here on site. You know why the money has to be in a safe. Yes, but we can reduce that danger by increasing security here. Of course the house and street have to appear normal. But what happened last night? We don't want that again. No, but it remains unclear why the perpetrators aborted. Our delay wasn't that great. It was impossible to maintain their schedule. If one includes police measures, yes. We learn, and the perpetrators do, too. It might've been a test run last night. They know we're covertly observing. Ancl they're observing, too, if they're any good at all. It's not that easy. You were observing us all along? - Mrs. Scheerer, we're protecting you invisibly. Many experienced people are involved. Mr. Osthoff! What I don't understand is, if you're observing us, why not radio to us how to find the electrical box? Your people watched us combing the whole area! Our people on site are not to blame. Our coordination could've been better. I'll look into it. I can't judge that, but I want the car and money here, alright? It just makes me very nervous if they're elsewhere. I understand your anger. - I'm not angry. Your disappointment. It's the perpetrators' move now. They have to change procedure. Not us. - Would you please answer me? "Wednesday, April 3, 1996. Dear Kathrin, I don't know what you're all doing. The drop-off went wrong last night. Nobody came. The atmosphere has deteriorated massively. They've threatened it might go on for months and they'll chop off my finger. I don't think it's an empty threat. Please, Kathrin, believe and help me. Now. Do not delay. I love you. Help me. I'm afraid and I can't take it. Jan Phi|ipp." Try to stand a bit straighter. You load, focus. Your target's there. Keep your arms nice and relaxed, and barn! Very good. Careful. But he's sweet! I'm really glad we won him. Oh, God! We kind of cleaned up the town. Where? At the shooting gallery? - Ancl brought you all something. And I want to go and live with... - A few flowers! With me? Please do. Mr. Imens! - Here. Thank you. On time as always. - Sure. See you soon. - Bye. Hey, Franz! Come on. Hi, Johann. - Hi. Bye, Franz. Bye. What? — Quit it. Now. Quit what? — Give it here. The camera? — Just the film. - What for? Take it out. You know this is off limits. Who are you with? - The German Press Agency. Once it's over, you'll be among the first to hear about it. No, it's off limits. No. I'll be in touch. Bye. The story is getting around. It's unavoidable. They haven't published anything yet, but the ladies and gentlemen of the press are insisting on their duty to inform, which I can understand. It's just not the right time. Got it. - Great. Put this on the table, please. And give it a stir. Need a hand? You can take this. I think it's time Mama got you both to bed. Good night, Papa. - Good night, sweetie. Good night. - Bye. What's for dinner? - A Frankfurt specialty: green sauce. Great. With all the herbs, huh? - Yes, all seven. Seven! Then potatoes and boiled eggs. And boiled beef? - No boiled beef, no. I'll get cutlery. You alright? Yup. Would you please open up? I want to be alone. What's wrong? Did you hurt yourself? Come back in. I was looking for a yellow book I'd thrown away. Was it important? I don't know. Jan Philipp wanted to practice Latin with me. He was kind of pissed. But tried to hide it. I noticed anyway. He told me about some Aeneas guy. Virgil's The Aeneid. So that's the book you're looking for? Yes. He was like: "Here. Read this. You'll have lots of time over Easter. But I said, "I'm not reading it!" I'm not reading 420 pages over Easter. Then the shouting began. We didn't even look at each other over dinner. And that's on your mind now? Yes. And maybe on his, too. We'll buy a copy tomorrow. If you still want to read it. Mr. Schwenn! Are you ready? Ready. I'm Schwenn, the lawyer. I'm listening. Disability? I didn't understand the rest. You have to speak more clearly. Who is Mr... - DUrsen the teacher. What disability did he have? My homeroom teacher was disabled, yes. What disability? He wasn't my homeroom teacher, but the disability was his leg, he was missing a leg. We'll be in touch. Could you understand him? The thing with the teacher was tricky. He wasn't your homeroom teacher? — No. He was Jan Phi|ipp's homeroom teacher, not mine. But you said that. - No, did I? I was fast asleep. I... wasn't ready. What kind of question was that? It can't have been Jan Phi|ipp's. I so dearly wished for the three of you to be reunited for Easter. I'd like to speak with the perpetrators myself next time. I've prepared this. Will you help me? Or are you unwilling? The Task Force office develops the concepts. - I know. I'm asking you anyway. Whether I approve? Yes. Will you and Nickel stand by me through this? Yes. Definitely. Can I read this to you? "Hello, can you hear me? This is Ann Kathrin Scheerer. I need clear directions about where to bring the money. You've been incomprehensible. We hear only unintelligible screeching. Please, I need this to be over soon. I can't take the waiting much longer. You're in no danger whatsoever. The main thing is for my husband to come back alive. Please call me back so I can understand you better. I'll be on the line myself. Please, how is my husband?" Can I make a copy of it? You'll get it back. Yes, of course. I'll go hide Easter eggs. In the yard. It's early, but I'll take a flashlight. I'll join you. This must've been Franz. Will you be seeing your family today? - Yes. This afternoon. If everything stays cool here, Vera and I will go home for an hour or two. And celebrate Easter. Sorry, that was insensitive. - No. Happy Easter. - Happy Easter. What now? Will there be a drop-off? No. Hey- - Hey- When did you last hide Easter eggs? Or is it contrary to your convictions? No, Cordelia and I don't have any children. I think that's it. Maybe check the house. Fantastic. Thanks. You'll play us a tune later, won't you, Johann? You do it. Nah. Unless someone sings. Requests, anyone? - That depends on your talent. That's all the motivation I need. I could play Moon River. I like that. - Then we'll practice it. Mr. Schwenn prefers improvisation. As does your boss, Osthoff, in his time management. Want to take some home? We have plenty. - No, thanks. Two colleagues are outside to cover for us. We'll be back tonight. The heads of the churches in Germany spoke out against resignation and racism in their Easter addresses. According to Lehmann, President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference, Easter gives people the faith to overcome difficulties that may otherwise overwhelm them. No! Five. It's your turn. Want to watch a film? Want to go choose one with me? We'll choose one, huh? Look. Come on. It was like drips from a nose bleed. Christian saw it, too. Forensics say it's Jan Phi|ipp's. We needn't discuss this now. I didn't even know he'd go over again. I come out of my study, look for him. No answer. Then I saw the open terrace door. Meaning he went over for a minute and got caught up in something. I tried to call him to ask when he'd be back. He didn't answer. I went to bed. I wasn't uneasy, I was... angry- It's unusual for one of us to leave without saying so. I woke up just before midnight. He wasn't in bed beside me. I went over through the yard, wanting to check if he'd fallen asleep in front of the television. All was dark and silent. Then I came back. And you were woken by Franz barking. I said, "Jan Philipp hasn't come back. I was bugged he wasn't answering the phone. That's why I went over." Then you said, "Why didn't you go inside?" "I didn't dare," I said. Then I went back over. Only then did I see something lying there. Every possible explanation that might've made it all seem normal suddenly vanished. I remember the cold. I was trembling so badly. I couldn't move. Thanks. No! It's plugged in and on line, but it just whistles without receiving a thing. Can you make it stop? It's annoying! We're on it. - What's going on? The fax is having technical trouble. - It was a really shitty night, and all you can do is wake us up? The fax is working. I just forgot to insert the paper. They'll call tonight after 9. It's a good sign. - Thanks. I didn't mean to shout at you. You didn't. Maybe you should. One from the perpetrators and two from Jan Philipp. One to Johann. Can you give it to him? "The longer we feel you're working together with the police, Mr. Schwenn, the longer this won't come to an end. We will also not continue talking to the police psychologist on the phone." Jan Philipp writes, "What confuses me is how my kidnappers are more professional than the police. During the call on Sunday evening or night, the officer on the line was easily identified. The 'Teacher Dilrsen' question, which would've been easy for you, needed repeating." There are no excuses, I... needed to clarify various times, it's true. You didn't answer the proof-of-ID question. - I did. Check your recording if you think otherwise. - We did. It's unconvincing. You seem surprised. I was. I'm not a talking automaton. I have feelings. Not for you. But for my client. Can you imagine that? Let's concentrate on the next conversation. I could conduct it because I'm less emotionally involved. I won't insist. He suggests a world trip after I graduate. "Then we'd have seen a bit of the world. "You see, I have time to come up with things. "Hamburg, Warsaw, Krakow, Prague." It starts and ends in Hamburg. Oh, you mean as a clue? They wouldn't let through such an obvious hint. But why a world trip? Well, he's imprisoned. Can't move. And wants a shared goal with you. What makes you think he can't move? You don't know this, but he's on a chain and can only move three paces. Why wasn't I told? - It'd only upset you to no end. And if I don't know, it won't upset me? In this matter... Otherwise, Kathrin is totally open with you. How do you all know what makes me tick? None of you have a clue. Aren't you cold without a jacket? I'll get it. This is Ann Kathrin Scheerer. Is this my husband's kidnappers? YQS. I'd like to tell you the following: I've done everything you wanted from the beginning. I want to finally give you the money. It's not true that you've been speaking to a police officer or psychologist. You've only spoken to my lawyer, Mr. Schwenn. Is he there? Yes, you can speak to him in a second. Maybe you don't know you're incomprehensible over the phone. Hotel Atlantic at the reception in one hour. Hotel Atlantic in an hour. At the reception. Leave a calling card. A calling card? My card? Mr. Schwenn's. Mr. Schwenn's... - A card. Alright. A drop-off wasn't mentioned, right? - I can't say. The money is coming. - Why? We didn't agree on that. So what? Don't be so stubborn. If there's an opportunity... Can we calm down? - Please leave the organization to me. It went so well last time. - This isn't happening without a squad. He's trying to arrange it. I think they're about to leave. I don't know... Evening. - Evening. I'm expecting a call. Will you let me know? — Certainly. I'll be over there. - Of course. I have to take their call at the Ibis hotel. Let us know before you take the call, Mr. Schwenn. Of course. You think I'd tell you afterwards? S0meone's filming from behind the curtain on the second floor. A ten-minute call. A first proper conversation. Audible. They trusted me. It was good. Is there a drop-off? - Wait. Nickel? Vera? Please record the following so I don't have to keep telling everybody everything. Got that? The perpetrator said my client will be home on Sunday or Monday if all goes well. "Well" means without police. He made very serious accusations about the first drop-off. They waited, we were late. It would've worked otherwise. And the drop-off? I'm not clone. - Can I get a word in? Will the money be handed over today? I offered, they refused. They have my cell, they'll let me know. When? - Over the coming clays. Sleep. There was a man last night filming from a window. If the police was there and the kidnappers saw... - Could you pass the coffee? Could Kathrin finish her sentence? Sorry, I know this theory. But of course. Then the drop-off will be aborted. - That's right. But it wasn't a drop-off. We had the money, we could've clone it. That wasn't the plan. - Because they can decide last-minute. They didn't. - Even if there was only the slightest chance, we should've used it. But no, the police were shadowing us. I understand why the police act this way: They want to bag them once Jan Phi|ipp's free. The agreement was: no police at the drop-off. It wasn't a drop-off! No, I have to speak to him now. Yes, he knows me. Scheerer: S... C! HI E, E... Yes, that's double E. R. I'm Ann Kathrin Scheerer. I want to see Mr. Osthoff. He's in a meeting. Can he call you? It has to be now. Is he in the building? One moment. I'll call to ask if he has time later. Do you have a mirror on you? I think I look terrible. I have a compact. I'm Claudia Brockmann. We've only spoken on the phone. You were striding through the building. You talked to an officer. Do you remember? Do you want a coffee? I'll leave you alone. I refuse to participate if there are police next time. No police. Promise me. Mrs. Scheerer, everyone here is working to ensure that your husband is released. "Dear Kathrin, I've been here 14 days now. There's been nothing but failed communication and drop-off attempts. For 14 clays, I've been chained up in a locked room counting myself lucky to even still be alive. The success of the next drop-off depends on you, and you alone. Meaning it must be conducted without police tactics. I want to, and have to get out of here." You know, what the perpetrators call "police tactics" is our job. If we do what they demand, if we surrender, then they've won. They're not like us. They don't want what you want, Mrs. Scheerer. They won't keep their word if they no longer need to. Whether they kill or not depends only on the punishment they'll receive. They don't want to spend their lives in prison for murder, but if we no longer have any cards, no way to proceed, no further clues, then they'll kill the only witness. So what they call police tactics is the most important reason why they have to keep the witness alive. Your ride is here. - I'm fine. Why didn't you say anything? I would've gone with you. I'm Anke. Ms. Hansen, would you come here? A policewoman was here. From the Mobile Task Force. She's supposed to ride along with Schwenn and pretend she works in his legal practice. That's good. Are you hungry? No, I'm tired. Schwenn speaking. - Are you ready? Yes, we are. My employee and I, the two of us. Drive to Luxembourg and check in at the airport hotel? I'm to await further news after midnight. The car is to be my Citroen XM. The girl's OK till the border. Get a transcription of the call. - Only till the border? I promised to drop her at the border. Did you suggest it or did they demand it? - I suggested it. Anke needs to stay with you all the way. I'm glad they allowed it at all. You can't re-negotiate our instructions. - Your instructions are irrelevant. If I obey them, I risk my client's life. I'm not willing to do that. We need your car, Mr. Schwenn. Keys and papers, too. I'm driving it. - We need to install the GPS. I have to speak to Mrs. Scheerer. Turn the mic off. - It is off. No, show me. I want to see you turn it off. Are you nervous? Do I look it? Nickel is the one who's uptight. Fiddling around with my mic... Is it even in place? Wait. Looks good. Anke Hansen can check again later. You can sleep while she drives. It'll be good if you're rested when they call you. I've observed how, when you're too concentrated on something and you get tired, you tend not to listen well. That's helpful right now. Do you mean concentrated or stressed? - It's just a tip. Let's not make this harder than it is. No need to pray for me. Have a beer instead. Could we maybe get a move on? It's 13:10 now! Where is Anke? Why isn't she here? That was a question! Would you mind answering? Please! They've changed the companion. Who is it? I don't know her. She's from the Mobile Task Force. She's uninstructed. There was no time. They say it's irrelevant. She's to be left at the border anyway. Feel free to tell him. They had to urgently replace your companion. We're 20 minutes behind schedule. That can be compensated during the 600 km trip. She's here! Great. Ms. Hansen, Mr. Schwenn. - Hello. Anke Hansen. I won't go with her. It's incredible what amateurs you all are! Get rid of her! Enough. This isn't about you. You and your people couldn't do worse if you tried. We're in a jam just after Osnabrfick. Should I take the exit? Look it up. There's a road map in the basket. There should be a thermos, too. Would you like some coffee? It's fresh. Well, perhaps you'll pour me some!? Hello? Do you read me? She texted me: "Get Mr. Choleric off my back." So, he dropped Anke on the border and is now at the hotel. A page carried his bag into the hotel and asked "What's in there?" "Gold," he replied. They both laughed. Brilliant, huh? - Right. Open or shut? Shut. Schwenn here. - Mr. Schwenn? Is that you? Leaving the hotel. Approaching his car. Driving away. They sent him off. He's on his way. Drive to the Markusberg service station. Markusberg is in Trier. The first station after the German border: Markusberg. Throw the money... Throw the money over the fence. $0? He did everything they told him to. They didn't pick up the ransom. Why not? We can do nothing but wait for fresh instructions. They're the ones who want something. Are you coming? Mr. Osthoff is downstairs. Schwenn is on his way. They're saying bad things about him. Who? The police. Mrs. Scheerer, I... No calls for an hour, please. Thanks. Last night at the hotel, they congratulated me. "Well done." This morning, there was no one around. Just a note under the door: "Money wasn't picked up." Will you describe your conversation with the perpetrators or shall I? I was asleep when they called. I gave my name. Fine. He asked me for my mother's name. You understood the question? The perpetrator was hard to understand, but my mother's name was clear. No, it wasn't. It wasn't about your mother's name, but your mother's housekeeper's name! I proved my identity. There was no problem. The perpetrator then gave me directions to the drop-off. There was no problem. - There was. The perpetrators aborted right after the phone call. They sent me off. - The man you spoke to wasn't entitled to decide. He simply told his accomplices you gave the wrong answer! On the way to the service station, I was overtaken by three cars. Bumper to bumper. Looked like police to me. And to them? With a team of 200, all top pros, as you always say, you can't even get rid of this money? Ancl now it's all my fault? I won't take the fall for this. - Were your people at the service station? Mrs Scheerer... - What's the point of us even talking? During the phone call, I was sure it would all fly. There was no distrust. I've got to go to bed. I'm wiped out. Leave your car here and take a cab. Do you still trust me? He's sending someone to pick up his things. He's not coming back? - No. He's on his way to his family. He needs time to himself. I want to see Tobias again. But how? Just back in school. Great to have you back. Hopefully in good health, too. Which of you can tell Johann what we've gone over since he's been away? I'll be at rehearsals next week. That's good. I can't wait. We've written two new songs. They're really good. I'm sure you'll like them. Want to do something together? Did you hear me? My father was kidnapped. We don't know where he is. Nobody does. We don't even know if he's still alive. What are you all going to do? What's he doing? - HQ to team. The target just rode down a pedestrian path. We can't follow. Can someone take over and follow him? Vera here. I'll put out a description. He's in a navy blue down vest with an olive jacket beneath it, black trousers, black shoes, and is riding a blue ten-speed. Find the kid as quickly as possible. Unbelievable. Feel like a stroll? I'd rather stay here. We all have to look out for each other. You can't just vanish. Then at least this: When you're angry... I'm not angry! I think you are. Look here. I found this in my bed. Scared me alright. I certainly didn't find it funny. Leave me alone. I'm tired. Look at me. What's going on in your head? Come on! Get off me. Just go away. Listen. I tried to talk to Johann after we kind of got into it this afternoon, but he's stressed out, and... doesn't want to burden you, so I'm the conductor. I can take it, no problem, but... I'm no longer any assistance to him. He needs distance. How about you just take a clay? - No. That won't do. It's best I go. You're not leaving because of me. Nonsense. Why would I? Thank you. For Johann. Are you Johann? Kathrin's outside. Let's go. She wants to talk. What's going on? - Come on, get in. Michael is an old friend, a politically engaged social worker. You know Hafen Street? Jan Philipp and I negotiated with City Hall for the squatters. We have a new approach. We're trying a drop-off without the police. Friends of ours received a letter. They called yesterday afternoon, claimed they have my number from Mr. Reemtsma, whom they kidnapped. "Could you help with the ransom drop-off," he asked. "Yes," I said. "Good, you'll be getting a letter from Mr. Reemtsma." That was all. My heart sank into my boots. You have the letter? - Yes, it arrived this morning. Looked authentic. I called Michael Herrmann, and you, Michael, said, "Shit, I'll drive over." "Dear Johann, I'd so ardently hoped to be back with you all soon. We'll have to endure a while longer. It'll work out fine. Do you know how much I love you? I bet you really can't imagine. I think a rerun of previous attempts would prove useless, so I've asked and authorized two uninvolved intermediaries to conduct negotiations and hand over the money: Lars Clausen and Christian Arndt." How heavy you've become! "It's best that way." Thanks for being here. When will we discuss your visitor this morning? Are you observing me? - No, but the house and the street. I assume you know him. - Yes. How does he know? - Ask your colleagues. They're trawling the left-wing scene for suspects. That attracted attention. Did you discuss police-relevant issues? He came to express his sympathy. Why aren't we being frank about how we proceed and who's doing the next drop-off? You tell me. As of now, I'm proceeding without the police. And if they call tonight? Won't happen. I'm going back in. I forgot something. Maybe we'll meet again someday. No, I don't care. That's final. Osth off. He reproached me: "Stop going behind the police's back. You're making yourselves accomplices." Is he right? It's not that simple. I've engaged a private security company. Good people. Osthoff is to sit down with them. It's good you're here. I was worried. Shall we go in? One word, please: What you're planning is punishable on several counts: It's abetment, it's obstruction of justice, it's endangering the well-being... I won't be threatened. None of these crimes will be committed if we cooperate properly. I don't want to. - "No police" only works with the police. Sounds paradoxical, but if something happens on the way to the drop-off, an accident or a traffic jam, we'll need you and your people. The difference between you and us is very simple: You have to catch the criminals, we don't. Two of your cars accompany us. As soon as we're close to the drop-off, your people turn off. No radio, GPS or helicopter. One condition: Your company isn't mentioned, and all and any success is attributed to our Task Force. I need a yes. Yes, Mr. Osthoff. But that will do. Can we start? It's 80 km/h here. Go ahead and sit down. They're at a service station near MiJnster awaiting further instructions. Clausen here. Drive past Krefeld's roadside church. Then take the second exit. Drive left onto the dirt road. This road isn't on the map. Stop! They're observing us. Exit the vehicle. Continue walking down the road. Do not turn around. Leave the keys in the ignition and move. Arndt's the name. Arndt, I say. I'd like a taxi to Biisinghoven. The telephone booth at the church. How long will it take? Thanks. What did he say? - Half an hour. Jaitner here. I see. Thanks. Pastor Arndt. The kidnappers called. They've got the money. WhY are YOU packing? We can't stay here after Jan Philipp is free. He won't have a moment's peace. The press will be everywhere. The security firm is taking us away. Here, could you please pack your bag? I'm scared. They have the money now. They don't need him anymore. Hello? We're on our way to see you. But the closer we get, the less I can picture you. Earlier, as I was paralyzed by fear, I remembered: "You can't squeeze a stamp between us." Whether it'll stay that way, I cannot say. But I can repeat it to myself and try to believe it. JAN PHILIPP REEMTSMA'S ABDUCTION ENDED AFTER 33 DAYS. THE DAY AFTER HIS RELEASE, RAINER OSTHOFF ANNOUNCED THE POLICE'S GRAND SUCCESS.
