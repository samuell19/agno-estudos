Come on, use your left. Use your left. Come on, fight me back. Please stop. Stop. Come on, use the left. Cover up. Cover up. Please. Nick, give the kid a chance. That's for leavin' yourself wide-open. Ha ha ha! What's he gonna do-- fan you to death? He ain't no better than his old man. Good thing Ida made you hang the gloves up. I don't like crybabies. Get up. Get up! How you expect to learn the kid anything, Nick? You was nothin' but a lousy prelim fighter yourself. All right, you no-good little bum. Let's walk to the station house. Let go, copper! Ah, save your shoe leather. There goes another little greaseball on his way. 10 years from now, the death house at sing sing. Again, rocky? Ma, how'd you know I was here? Just like a homing pigeon. I busted out of the protectory. Three times in two years. They gave the flash to every police car from the Bronx to Brooklyn! Boy, let them try and find me! They're not lookin' for you. What? That's why the police come tonight. To tell me they're through with you, rocky. They're tryin' to fool you. I'm on the lam! They don't want you, rocky, but I do. No, leave me alone. Leave me alone. Why don't you give up on me, Ma? I don't know how. I ain't no good. Give up on me. Sure... Maybe tomorrow, but tonight, you're gonna get some sleep. Come. What am I gonna do with you, you devil? Why get in an uproar? How much can your mother take? You're drivin' her to her grave! Nobody can hold you, even with iron bars! You won't go to school or work! Just don't worry about it! That's all you ever say! When are you gonna be somethin'? What do you mean? Like you, huh? How much did you make this week? What did you ever give us around here except wine breath and the back of your hand? I look at you and see the devil. Get out of my sight. Hi, rocky. I got you eggs for breakfast-- a celebration. Never mind, Ma. Where are you goin'? To be somethin'. Rocky! Tomatoes! Tomatoes! Ripe tomatoes! Hey, whose house you gonna rob tonight? Who you gonna knock over, big-a man? Hey, romolo. Hey, rocky, when did you get home? I got out. What about my other shoe? Eat it. Without you, I'm just nickels-and-dimes. We'll find Fidel and shorty, and then we'll make plans. What do you say, Fidel? Rocky. Come on. When did you get out? Hey, shorty the Greek. Come on, Buddy boy, we got work to do. Hey, what you think you're doin'? Why, you stinkin' little-- aah! Take off! Let's go, guys! You tryin' to get killed? I just wanted to see whether your brakes worked. Hey, hey, I think I got a bite. Look out below! 50? Oh, come on. Come on. 75 tops. My inventory's way overloaded. How can you split 75 four ways? It don't come out even. 80, then... Come on. What are you gonna do with the money? Buy some clothes, huh? Yeah, we're no bums. Wait a minute. Take a look. Beautiful $100 suits. For you guys, 20 bucks apiece. Fellas! Get out of here! Come on! That's mine! Good mornin'. Oh, yeah, good mornin'. Breakfast. Oh, thanks. Hey, what's the program for today? Pick up Fidel and shorty the Greek. Then what? School. School? Yeah. I've always dreamed of robbin' a school. Thanks. Hey, you two, get away from there! What do you think you're doin'? I'll get you guys. We told you to stay out of polack territory! Nobody robs our schools but us! Aah! Ugh! The bulls! The bulls! I can't make it! Come on, jump! Hold it! Frisk 'em. Who'd you unload the stuff with this time? What stuff? Everything that wasn't nailed down and some that was. What are you talkin' about? Who give you the money? My old man give it to me, yeah. Ha! Nick Barbella, huh? 210 bucks, Mr. Barbella. He says you give it to him. Yes or no? You remember. 'Course he give it to him! Mr. Barbella? All I ever give him was wine breath and the back of my hand. Thanks. Come on. All I could think of, your honor, as I saw this little child crying-- he once attempted to burn down a police station. It's against my better judgment, but I'll give him another chance. I'll remand him to the custody of his parents and probation officers, but this other fellow's reports are a disgrace. True, your honor-- are the parents in court? Yes, the mother is here. Where's the father? He refused to come. Rocco Barbella's been a burden to his mother ever since he was old enough to run. The children's court remanded him to the protectory. Three times he broke out to join his gang and terrorize the neighborhood. We must save this boy from a criminal career. He has got to know that if he is going to commit burglaries, he cannot be at large. I'm therefore committing him to mackinock for an indeterminate sentence. No! Maybe they'll be able to break his spirit. Next case. We'll see whose spirit gets broke. Don't wreck the floor. You're gonna sleep on it. Shut up, you lousy screw! You'll get over it, kid, even if it takes 20 years. Open 32. What would you like for breakfast? Your cruddy head on a silver platter! I'm George nyles. Cigarette? My men tell me you're giving yourself a rough time here. Maybe we ought to talk things over. Why you-- hold it! Hold it! All right. You licked me, Barbella. 20 years, and I never laid a hand on one of my boys. There ain't no place I can't lick! Send him to the reformatory. Get rid of him. Come on, dig! Just one mouthful. Just one. Why don't you give him a drink, geezer? Sure. Sure. You have one first, huh? Start somethin'! Just give me an excuse. Let's get out of here! Make a break! Give me the gun! Do you want to get the chair? No, no, don't. Don't. You ever think of puttin' on a glove? No, not a chance. I own little pieces of two fighters. Sometimes they win. Sometimes they dive like swans. Either way, there's money in it. I ain't puttin' gloves on. Why not? 'Cause the only glove fighter I ever knew is a bigger bum than I am. If you ever need quick money, look me up at Stillman's gym. I'm Frankie Peppo. Yeah? Rocky Barbella. I'm pleased to meet you. My pleasure. Welcome to riker's island. They couldn't handle you at reform school. Well, this is no reform school. We run a good penitentiary here and a tough one. You pull here what you pulled up there, we'll put a bullet through your head. Now, you got that straight? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You don't believe that, do you? 30 days in the hole. Let him spit in the dark. I don't know why anybody would want to see you, but you got a visitor-- special privilege. Come on. Hey, Ma. Don't worry about me, Ma. I'll have this joint licked. Why don't you ask me why I haven't come for six months? Why don't you ask me where I've been? County hospital, that's where. Tied to a bed. Shock treatment. Tryin' to save me from losin' my mind. Ma! You keep me up all night with worry so as I can't sleep. I'm goin' out of my mind. Ma, cut it out! Will you stop it? I'm through, rocky. I can't fight your fights or raise my hand for you. You been talkin' to the priest? What will I do with you? Don't worry, huh? Don't worry. That's all you ever say is don't worry. You think I talked to the priest? Yes, the father told me I'm doing the right thing. He said nobody can help you, rocky, but you, yourself. Maybe you think I'm hard-hearted, but what I'm going to do is the only thing I can think of. G-going to do what? I am the last person who cares whether you live or die or rot in jail, but if you turn your back on me and go back to your scum friends, you are no longer my son. Ma, I try to turn the leaf, but I can't make it! It's something inside me! I pray to god you'll try. Because if you don't, I'll be through with you, and I don't know what else to do. Look, Ma, just don't worry. Just don't worry about a thing. Don't worry about a thing. Don't worry about a thing. Ma? Ma! You got three minutes to go. You'll serve every second of it. The only thing good about you is I'll never see you again. Next time, you go to the fed. 6 years out of 10 I been in the can. I'll never get locked up again. One thing this lousy place give me is a taste for being on the outside. Get out, Barbella. Thanks. What do you know? Two minutes off for good behavior. Rocco Barbella? Yeah. Look, you guys ain't got nothin' on me. I'm clean. You got a date, and we're making sure you keep it. Barbella, you're volunteering to be drafted into the United States army. Back in stir again? You're kidding. No. We're not kidding. Neither is Hitler. I can't make it right now. I got living to catch up with. In about six months, we'll talk again, ok? All right, fall in. Who is it? Corporal quinbury. Am I disturbing you? What time is it? 5 past 11:00. Well, good morning, private. What do you say? I trust you found everything satisfactory? Where do you get something to eat? Where were you at roll call? Don't you know you're in the army? Stand at attention and say, "yes, sir." Knock it off, Mac. Barbella, you're on permanent company detail. You can start by policing the area around this tent. Now pick up that cigarette butt. What did you say? I said move! Listen, I'm running this tent. I'm sleeping as late as I want to. If you rat to the warden, I'll bust you. Pick up that butt and move! Anybody bothers you guys, just let me know. Thousands of them marching in circles. Not one lousy face that I know. Not from the east side or any can I been in. Never seen so many square creeps. Come on, let's go to town, huh? We go schmooze around, shoot a little pool? Stop trying to get us in trouble. Ain't no trouble while I'm runnin' this tent. They can court-martial you for going without a pass. What's this court-martial? You'll find out. Come on, Buddy boy, let's go. Let's go into town. Atta boy, go to town. I'm not your Buddy boy. I'm not going to break regulations because you want company. We don't like being drafted either, but we got put in the army and we're trying to do our best, understand? Creep! Hit me. The only thing it'll prove is that you're a common criminal. So knock me out if it'll make you feel better. There he is. That's the one. All right, soldier, let's go. You don't have much regard for rules, soldier. You don't seem to have much regard for anything. What is this about rules? Why don't you put me someplace where I can fight them Hitler soldiers. Let's get it over with. You're from New York City. Yeah. You mean, "yes, sir"! Yeah, yes, sir. I gather from the way you talk you're like the tough guys we got coming in. I guess we'll have to knock that out, fella, because I want to tell you right now-- there's no room in this man's army for a wise guy, understand? You could be a captain, but you don't impress me! Come on outside! Soldier, are you just plain crazy? Maybe I am! But at least I ain't yellow! Hey, sarge, what's a nine-letter word for-- you're in the army now, soldier. Forget everything but four-letter words. Who is it? It's me. Open up. Rock, I thought you was in the army. What are you doing here? No, not 10 after 6! You got some scratch? Me? Nothin'-- A couple bucks. I been doin' pretty lousy, rocky. Everybody's in the army. Can't get no one to muscle for me. Hey, rocky, you comin' back with me? No, I got into this bad jam with this captain at camp. It'll take real dough to buy him off. How much? Maybe a grand? I don't know these captains' prices, but I can't go back till I can square the rap. Your old lady always done good with bail bondsmen. She don't know I'm on the lam. Hey, what's his name? Who? This guy-- Frankie Peppo. He said if I ever needed quick dough... I got to get some clothes. What size suit you wear? You'd split the seams. Knock it off. Go get me a suit. I ain't got any dough. So? Ring one--Ramon Santalito and Eddie O'Flare. Look out below. I listen to you enough. Now listen to me. Of course you're tired. How many times I got to tell you? Either you want to be a fighter or have fun like Errol Flynn. Where's Frankie Peppo? What is this? Information, please? Try Lou Stillman. Come here, you. Telephone call for Marty O'Brian for a change. Hey, Mr. Stillman, the floor in the shower is very slippery. I almost fell and hurt myself. Take showers at home, if you got one. This guy said you could tell me-- Max-- Booth two. What's going on here? Max Natfield's wanted on the phone, and that ain't all he's wanted for. Who are you looking for? Frankie Peppo. Tell me how to find him. Sure, I'll tell you. You take a subway to grand central station, then a train to sing sing. But don't hurry-- you got 2 to 10 years to get there. Tell Peppo to stay away from here. I'm not running a social hall for thieves. Lou, Eddie is giving me the twisted ankle routine. It isn't twisted-- It's yellow. Do you expect tiger flowers for $10? Send out a call on whn and dig up a sparring partner. There must be someone who needs a sawbuck. Yeah. Me. You want to mix with my boy? Sure. Have you done much fighting? Yeah. Where? Oh, all around. All around with who? What? Lots of guys. Uh-huh. What's your name? Rocky. Rocky what? Graziano-- Rocky Graziano. Oh, like the Italian wine? Yeah. Like the Italian wine. You go in the locker room. Tell Chuck that Irving says you need trunks and a head guard. Make sure you get a cup! That's ok. I'll drink out of the bottle. Jab. Jab. Get in close. Throw your right. Right! Get in close. Hit him! Come here. Do you realize who you just knocked out? That's a top light-heavyweight! He got me mad. I forgot where I was. Where did you learn that? Do I still get $10? Ramon bought that jaw at steuben's glass. Rocky, this is Whitey Bimstein. How would you like him to train you? Give me my 10 bucks. Sure, but I'd like to handle you. I ain't got time for $10 fights. No, no, no! 50, 75, $100 a bout in no time at all! Sure, sure. You get another guy for me to flatten, get in touch with me at Benny's candy store. If I ain't found a better way of picking up quick dough, I'll fight for you. Meshugana. Sometimes, I think I never should've left the lingerie business. I was the happiest man in ladies' underwear. A hundred places in this city to have fights-- these guys pick the army. Sit down, rocky. Relax a little. Everybody's nervous their first fight, kid. You got nothin' to worry about. Nothin' to worry about. Yeah. Nothin' to worry about. You better come with us. All right. I'll come. There's a big crowd, and they blocked the aisle. Follow us to the ring. Come on, come on. Oh, yeah. Let's go, hightower! Rock this baby to sleep! Graziano, your bicycle has a flat! Somebody introduce these guys! Come on, hightower! Come on, hightower! Let's go, hightower! What are you looking for? He's in front of you. Break it up. I got to get out of here. Go to your corner! Rocky! Yeah, I know you got a great right hand, but there's more than one hand on a fighter. You got to learn how to box. Ok, Cohen, just give me the dough. Ok, kid, ok. Here's, uh... 40 for you, and 10 for me. Thanks. What about you and whitey getting together tomorrow afternoon? Just leave a message when you got another fight. Aren't you going to take a shower? That's ok. It's raining out. 155 1/2. 155 1/2. Ok, Graziano, purple tights. Be in the dressing room at 7:30. Take this with you. They'll ask for it. 155. 155. You faded another 2 pounds. You haven't been eating like I told you. What do you want? I can't do better than six straight kos. Gasto is a rough guy. This is your first 6-rounder. He could hurt you, rocky. So I get $75 in a 6-rounder. Do me a favor-- get me hurt in a 10-rounder? What've you been doing with this money? 137. 137. Light trunks. 8:00 in the dressing room. I'll go with you guys. Don't start trouble. Who's your manager? Mr. Cohen. We'll have to take you for harboring a fugitive. Look, he don't know nothin'. I never told him I run away from the army. I never even told him my right name. It isn't Graziano? No, it isn't Graziano. We owe you an apology, Cohen. Get your clothes, Barbella. Rocky, I'll go down there-- just do one thing for me. Give this to Mrs. Barbella. Ida Barbella. Top floor. 141 east 10th street. Tell her-- no. Don't tell her nothin'. Just give it to her. The accused has admitted his guilt and can only hope for this court's mercy. Barbella? Well... I, uh... I made a bad mistake, sir. I've been very stupid. I'm sorry I done what I done. I should've known the army wasn't just another can. But I been in prison too long, sir. I know I can learn this army business. Colonel, please give me another crack at it. Is that all? Yeah. Barbella, Rocco, 32201881, private, selective service unassigned. To the charges of being absent without leave for a period of four months, the accused is found guilty to the specifications. Upon secret ballot, 2/3 of the members concurring, the accused is sentenced to be dishonorably discharged from the service of the United States, to forfeit all allowances due, and to be confined at hard labor at leavenworth disciplinary barracks for one year. Inside. Ok to lock. Door jammed somewhere. Check the line. Check the line. Clear that door. I said, clear that door, prisoner. Can't you see I'm occupied? Heldon, I'll give you 10 seconds to clear that door, or you're a dead soldier. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Cut loose with that gun... 6... I'm gonna jump on you. 7... You and me's going over that railing. You're going to crack your skull on that cement floor! Wonder what he's in for. Me, I'm in for shooting a second looey. It was an accident-- I think. What are you in for? For being a jerk, like him. That's two packs you owe me. How come you're so good? It's the same as throwing bricks through store windows. Little guy, go get me my horseshoe. Who, me? Yeah, you. Ain't in the mood. Little guy, you don't hear so good, do you? I said go get me my horseshoe. I don't wanna. Now wait a minute, Heldon, look. Why make a guy do something if he don't want to? You ought to respect that. You see? New York, you are absolutely correct. Now ain't he, fellas? Oh, sure. Little guy, you don't have to get my horseshoe. You do it. It's the same. I don't want to. He don't want to. There's the middleweight you've been looking for. Come on, break it up! Better see what this boy's history is. I already did, sir. He's never had a dull moment. Name's Barbella. Fought as rocky Graziano while awol. Six bouts--six kos. Good right, no left. We've got him for a year, minus the two weeks in solitary for this. Here he is, sergeant. Ok, you can leave us. I'll call you. Barbella? Yeah. I'm John hyland. Cigarette? Oh, yeah. Thanks. I run the boxing squad. Like to join? No, thanks. The bouts we put on improve morale. You could help. What do you say? I ain't interested in fightin'. You did pretty good against Heldon. It got me in the hole. You did pretty well as rocky Graziano. I needed the scratch. I would have done anything. Six kos. Not bad. All my life I been fightin', and all my life I been gettin' in trouble. I don't want no more trouble. I don't want to fight, ok? Sure. Here, sit down. Come on, sit down. Rocky, I wasn't thinking about the morale of the men. I was thinking about myself. You see, the boxing squad is the colonel's pride and joy. I could help myself with you on the squad. Now, I don't think you'd ever show any real style, but you'd probably lick my boys because you got something inside a lot of fighters don't have, never will have, no matter how much I teach them-- hate. I don't know why it's there. I know if anybody hits you, he better start ducking fast. That hate pours into your right hand and makes it like a charge of dynamite. What a waste of a lot of hate. It always got you into trouble. Why don't you let it do you some good? Oh, yeah? What good is it gonna do for me? Can it get me back in the army? No. It's too late for that. I'm sorry, rocky. You might have fought a darn good war. Know what you'll do when you get out of here? None of you guys ever do. You leave prison just as dumb as you go in, itching for the same trouble. Let me give you an alternative. Join my squad, and I'll put you through a year of hard labor. I don't mean skipping rope and clowning around. You'll dig ditches till your back breaks. You'll curse me for it. When you leave, you'll be in condition. Maybe you'll have learned enough to get by in a tough racket. Be a fighter, rocky, a professional fighter. You were doing good at it. Well, do better. Make that hate of yours work for you inside the ring. Outside of the ring, it'll just go on lousing up your life. Who knows? You might even lose that hate some day. Is that bad? Maybe you'd rather go on spitting in your own face for the rest of your life. Yeah, rocky! Rocky! Army didn't hurt him none. Never seen anybody in such good shape since selling girdles. He's got a lot to learn yet. Not to kill. 7... 8... 9... 10! Yeah! 4... I think I'll take a walk. Why don't Mr. Bimstein teach you to duck? What are you talking about? It matches my shirt real good. Look, folding money. Wade folded in the second round. I'm gonna get some ice cream. And stand on the street corner taking bows from the neighborhood, Mr. Jack Dempsey? Oh, gamina, gamina. Dempsey's a heavyweight. So long as they can't put you in jail for it. Hey, pop. Hey, what do you say? Took him in two. For what? So I can wind up with breath like a winery? For what? He didn't get that way bein' a fighter. He got that way not bein' a fighter. Remember that. He had the bad luck to find me. What are you talking about? It was easy for him to think he loved me. I wasn't dirty and nasty and hittin' him in the face. So what did I do? "Give it up, Nick. Stop bein' a fighter. I won't marry you." Fightin' was in his blood like dope, so it kills him when he quits. Don't blame him, rocky, it's me. Come on, Ma. Cheer up, will ya? You'll see. Everything's going to be ok. Don't worry about a thing. Ok? Ok. Ok. I'll see you later. Hello, rocky. Oh, hi, sis. Rocky, this is my girlfriend, Norma Unger, from Brooklyn. Hello. Hello. Rocky, where you goin'? The candy store. Norma's just dying to meet you, but she's kind of shy. Well, she just met me. I thought that maybe we could double-date sometime. Mama, throw me the key! Sis, don't worry about a thing. Just leave me alone. I ain't got no time for girls. Woo-woo-woo! Hi, rocky. What are you doin'? Hey, Benny! Hey! It says here I'm a promising young middleweight. Everybody who is young is promising. The world should sue the young for breach of promise. Give me another one. Eating and drinking are inadequate substitutes for achievement. You must have said somethin' real smart, 'cause I didn't understand a word. I've always been a wise man, rocky. I'm not exactly a philosopher, but I know what I'm talking about. My night-school class voted me the man most likely to own his own candy store. Ha ha ha! Something to drink, young lady? I'm not exactly thirsty. A nice sandwich? I'm not exactly hungry, either. Salami? Pastrami? Hot corned beef? Can I interest you in a cigar? Could you tell me how to get to deager street in Brooklyn, by subway, I mean? Three blocks north, four blocks west. The Brighton express to kings highway, and the bus to ocean parkway. Or take the canarsie line to 8th Avenue, the e train to 4th street, d train to kings highway, the bus to ocean parkway. Any questions? I'll find it somehow. Good night. Any time. Good night, rocky. Oh, yeah, good night. I'll see you. The check! Hey, wait up. I'll walk you to the subway entrance. You don't have to do that. It's rainin'. It's stopped. Maybe it'll start up again. Come on. Well, good night, rocky. Oh, yeah. Good night. Hey! I better wait with you on the platform till the train comes. You don't have to. I mean, you shouldn't take no chances in subway stations after midnight. What kind of chances? You just shouldn't, that's all. You want a stick of gum? Ok. Here. Thank you very much. Oh, it's my pleasure. Well, good night, rocky. Yeah. Good night. I better ride you out to Brooklyn. You don't have to, rocky. You don't want to be alone on the subway this late at night. The train is crowded with people. Suppose they all get off. Oh, come on. Well, good night, rocky. Oh, well, I'd better see you to the door. I always forget my key. I'll have to buzz. I'll buzz. What's the number? 3b. Right there. It don't say unger. It says levine. That's my stepfather. My mother remarried since we came over here. Oh, you're a Jewish girl, huh? Yes. Why? Does that make any difference? No. You kiddin'? Thanks for walking me to the subway entrance. Oh, yeah. Take it easy, kid. Will you call me or something? Yeah. I mean, I suppose. I don't know. Fighters ain't got much time for girls. May I kiss you? No, you mustn't. Oh, darling. Darling. Have I told you I love you? You been tellin' her for two hours, creep. Shh. I'm so frightened, David. Of what, Alice? Loving you too much and losing you too soon. Let's get out of here. I want to see the rest of it. Come on. I'm always with you, Alice. Every movie anyone says, "I love you," you moan, groan, and squirm. It's for the birds, this whole love business-- guys tryin' to score with dames to feel big. What do you do to feel important? Come and see me fight. I've told you no. That's what makes me feel important. You got to hear them crowds screamin' my name. They grab at me going up the aisles. That makes me feel important. I can't stand seeing people hurt, especially you. You could come to the gym and see me train sometime. I mean, just train. I won't have to see men hurting each other? Scout's honor. For six months, I can't get him to train. Then on the day of a fight, he trains. He's a meshugana. Hey, hold it. Who's next in ring two? Hey, that's her. Come on. Hey, Lou. Hey, that's her. That nice-looking girl is interested in you? Yeah. Take care of her for me. I'll take care of her. I'm Lou Stillman. So you're rocky's girl, huh? I suppose so. There's a chance maybe you're not? I suppose so. Let's you and me take a walk around. Let's have a little talk about the pugilistic profession. You was superb. Turn around. What's the matter? I wanted to make sure he didn't smear your lipstick. Is that the way you're gonna fight tonight? Hey, Lou. Where is she? Down the stairs. Gone out. What? Is she coming right back? I lay 4-to-1 against. What did you do? What did you say? Nothin'. I just asked why a nice Jewish girl was interested in a no-good fighter. I ought to bust-- no workouts after 2 p.m. You Arthur Murrays in ring two-- get outta there! All right. Where you been? When? All day, all night! Where you been? The movies. I looked in 87 of them. The one you won't let me see the end of, with people saying nice things to each other. What do you mean? It's no use. I was right. Seeing that place, talking to Mr. Stillman. He don't know nothin'. I'll never like fighting. It's all meanness and blood and ignorance. Maybe it is all meanness and blood and ignorance. Maybe guys end up with rattled brains. Where else can a guy like me be something? I never had nothin' till my chance in the ring. What's better-- stealin', starvin', or fightin'? Please, Norma, now you gotta understand this. Mr. Stillman said you've probably been in all kinds of trouble. You'll always be in trouble. Maybe I was in trouble once, but never again. Never? No, never. I give you my word. Oh, boy, oh, boy. I'm gonna go in that ring tonight-- what time is it? 11:30. Oh, no. What's the matter? I'm in trouble again. All right, Graziano, explain what happened last night. Failure to show for a bout is serious business. Why shouldn't the commission revoke your license? Well, uh, commissioner, you ever been in love? I suppose so, in my time. See, I didn't know it till last night, but I am in love. Yesterday afternoon, my girl and me had this big trouble, and she run out on me. I forget about everything except trying to find her. I forget what time is it, I forget about the fight. Did you find her? Yeah, in Brooklyn, crying in the rain. By the time we make up, it's too late to get to the arena. If you said any other excuse in the world, your fighting days would be over, but this is just too corny. You could only be telling the truth. Don't let it happen again. Yeah, thanks. Thank you very much, commissioner. Oh, you're such a worrier. Come here. What's wrong? What's the matter? Come here. Now, listen, kid, I got 10 guys in my stable doing better than you're doing. I wouldn't be wasting five minutes with you if you didn't have the potentialities for important money. What do you want from me? Stop ruining the whole schmeer before it's off the ground. You got to stop killing yourself with Norma. We're doin' fine. Look at yourself. Yeah, I'm lookin'. Look at your eyes. What do you mean? Not a ring, not a circle. Do you know any grown-up men without circles under their eyes? Do you know you're supposed to have circles under your eyes? Put your hand out. Spread the fingers. Steady as a rock. Where is the normal, "I got it, everybody's got it" slight movement of the fingers? Where is the tremor? Wait. Tsk tsk tsk. What, what? Hmm! Rocky, you've got to stop killing yourself with Norma. Either give the girl up-- give her up? Or marry her. Marry her? Maybe that's just the utz you need to keep you from being a two-bit club fighter. Maybe that's exactly what you need-- responsibilities, bills, another mouth to feed-- a lot of little mouths to feed. Maybe that will be the utz that lays the golden egg. The judge won't wait there all day, rocky. You brung the license, huh? I have it in my bag. I thought maybe you forgot it. No, I didn't forget it. I ain't got enough dough. I have. Where did you get it? I pawned my star of David. Norma, you shouldn't have done it. I ain't worth it. I got a prison record. Worse than that, when I was in the army-- it's too late, rocky. I'm in love with you. What you said is right-- it's no good being mixed up with a fighter. It's all meanness and... Blood and ignorance. Yeah, that's it. Come on, we're late for our wedding. How can you ask me to go in a courthouse? That's where people get married. Courthouses make me be uncomfortable. Definitely! Rocky, you've given me a lot of reasons why not. But I still haven't heard what would convince me. What's that? Just tell me you don't love me. Come on. For nobody else would I get up in the middle of the night. Nobody else would have the chutzpah to ask. Can I help it if Norma wants ice cream? Can I help she's pregnant? Waa! I can't get over it. It looks just like you. How can it? It's a girl. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! How ya doin', rock? Hey, rocky! Rocky! Hiya, rock! How'd you do it? Don't go breathin' on the baby, will ya? What's the matter? What did he do? You're a lucky guy, rock! Waa! Honey. It's only daddy. Waa! Waa! Waa! Honey, it's only daddy. Waa! Waa! Honey. Waa! Aah! Mommy, it's only daddy. Both fighters are covered with blood. Zale is crowding rocky across the ring. A right to the kidney, another right to the kidney, a right to the stomach. Graziano is staggering. Zale explodes a left to the jaw. Another left to the jaw. Graziano is down! 7, 8, 9, 10. It's all over! Zale wins! Tony zale is still the middleweight champion of the world. Norma, he'll be all right. Sure he will. He's hard and tough. He can take anything. But I can't. He had to lose sometime. It isn't whether he loses or wins. When he steps into that ring, I'd like to run and hide, knowing maybe they'll hurt him, cripple him. Did you ever tell this to rocky? Did you ever ask him to stop fighting? It's his whole life, everything he's got. Then it's your whole life. Don't ever make the mistake of forgetting that, like me. That's right. I didn't marry a man, did I? I married a middleweight. Come, yolanda, we must go. Norma has to fix her face. Soon her husband will be coming home, a husband knocked out for the first time. Hi. Yeah, hi. What are you doin'? Ironing. What, tonight? Has to be done sometime. You hungry? Did you hear the fight tonight? Yes, I heard it. There's chicken in the refrigerator, and I saved you a piece of pie. That all you got to say? You were terrible. That's all I need! You hit him with everything you had and couldn't finish him. You had him on his back and couldn't finish him. Then he hits you one punch in that spaghetti basket of yours, and boom! Wait till next time! I'll murder him! I'll kill him! I'll tear his head off! I'll cream him! Hey, come here. That ain't what I'm gonna do to Tony zale. Definitely. Zale, zale, zale. That's all he thinks about. What's wrong with that? I have to keep his mind on his next fight. It's cowboy shank, then zale. Rocky's a sure thing over shank. This is strictly a warm-up. Save that for your readers. Billy Arnold was a sure thing the night Graziano knocked him out. How's it look? Keep it like a cop stopping traffic. Could we throw some punch lines? Not now. I've got a date with two dames. Don't print that. I'm takin' Norma and Audrey to the zoo. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! What do you say? Rocky big shot. Hey, Peppo! They sprung ya! All bad things have to end. You look great. The rest agreed with me. Let's get a beer. I can't. My wife is pickin' me up. I think we better have a beer. We got something important to talk about. Like what? This guy who was at leavenworth. We have to handle him. What handle? What guy? This guy figures it might be worth something that no one should know you was kicked out of the army with a dishonorable, and the year in the federal pen. I'll wait for you downstairs, rock. What I done, I done. I never got around to telling my wife, not that it would make no difference. Of course not. But them boys' clubs I go to, I gotta think what they'd say, and kids Audrey plays with. It wouldn't do no good. We got to take care of him. What does he want? I mean, I'll give him a couple of cs. No, not him. He wants to make a killing on the shank fight. Ain't no book gonna take no dough on me. They know I can take shank with no hands. Not on you, rocky. He wants to bet on shank, get 5, 6-to-1 with out-of-town books. I should go in the tank? Yeah, an upset. You're sore at the wrong guy. You're the guy. I should have known it. Suppose there's 100 gs in it for you? What are you tryin' to do? I'm clean now, understand? A lot of people think I'm ok. I'm not gonna let nobody louse that up for me. I'm with you all the way. I don't want to see no sad stories about you. In all them prisons, the dishonorable discharge-- you're crowdin' me. I can't think straight. There's plenty of time to think straight. Sit down here. Rock! Hi, rocky! Can I have your autograph for my sister? Hey, rocky! Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing in the street? Why aren't you home where you belong? Gee, rocky, we was only waitin' for you. Go on home, or to a playground, before I flatten you! All of you beat it! Out of the streets! Hi, darling. Rocky, I want you to meet my friends. Lou, Willie, meet rocky Graziano. Lou and Willie just come back from a little trip. They was up around Minneapolis, where they get 6-to-1 on shank and they go for quite a bit of action. They figure I tell them it's in the satchel, I know what I'm talkin' about. The bets are down, rocky. Don't go winnin' no fight and wind up with very bad newspaper clippings. Come here. Let's see them. Funny, they look like any other pair of ordinary Dukes to me. Go tell that to the crowd downstairs waitin' to see these ordinary Dukes knock some ordinary bum's ordinary brains out. Lou Stillman says you're the world's most popular Italian, with the possible exception of Michelangelo and Frank Sinatra. Where's Irving? Downstairs. Go get him. We got to call off the fight. What's the matter? It's my back, that's it. I must have pulled a muscle or somethin'. It hurts to throw the right. Let me feel. I told you I hurt myself. Go get Irving. Sure. Sure. We're back two days, already I'm losin' my tan. Easy come, easy go. Mr. Graziano? Yeah? D.A.'S office. They want to talk to you. What about? They just need some information. They want zale tickets, I'm in the book. Why don't you come along, huh? I'll be right back. Don't worry about a thing. I don't know. I'm tellin' ya, I don't know. You can do boxing and the community a real service. Just tell us who approached you with the offer. We need your help to exterminate these vermin. You say you had a sore back. We say you faked it. You didn't want to doublecross anyone, and you couldn't take a dive. It doesn't matter who's right. You didn't accept the bribe. You didn't listen to these men. You've already admitted you were approached-- well, yeah-- finish the work you've started. Give us the names. I can't. Why not? I don't know who they were. There's always characters hangin' around. They're creeps, disturbers, they crawl out from under rocks. Who bothers to ask their names? Have you ever read the rules of the New York state athletic commission? All I know is what my manager tells me. If he tells me it's so, it's so. Failure to report attempted bribe is punishable by having your license taken away. If you'll tell us the names, I'll pass it on to the commission, and you'll have complied with the rules. I ain't got no names to name. Don't force our hand. Are you sure that's your final answer? It's my final answer. I ain't got no names to name. Do you know these men? No. I never seen them before, I swear. Ok, bring in the others. Do you know these men? No, I never seen them before in my whole life. We find from the evidence, and from your own admissions, it was suggested the shank bout be conducted as a sham or collusive contest in consideration of an offer to you of $100,000. You never reported this request or suggestion to the commission. The shank contest was called off subsequently because of a back injury reported by you to a commission doctor. That has no bearing on this hearing. Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances adduced before us, and in accordance with the discretion vested in us by the state, the commission hereby revokes your license as a boxer, effective immediately. Further, it follows the proposed contest between middleweight champion Tony zale and yourself in the state of New York is hereby canceled. This hearing is adjourned. Don't worry, kid. We'll find something for you to do. He's got nothin' to say. Have a heart. He's got nothin' to say. Maybe ya got somethin' to say about this. How about a statement, Mrs. Graziano? What does he have to do to please them-- become a thief again? Turn them off. What are you sitting in the dark for? I'm thinkin' about all my friends like the commissioner and the d.A. That-- turn off the lights, I can see 'em better in the dark. How long are you gonna go on like this? Listen to what bill corum says in the journal- American-- "until rocky has done more wrong, I'll fight for his right to fight." Oh, yeah, sportswriters. They was always good to me. What about them other guys, smearin' it all over what a rat I am! Stop it, rocky! Graziano's a no-good criminal! Remember that! Graziano's the scum of the slums-- stop it! Hello. Yeah, who is it? What do you want? I don't want nothin', rocky boy. I been readin' about your troubles. I had nothin' to do with that story in Chicago. Peppo, you always want somethin'. I ain't interested, you get it? Sure, kid, I get it, but anytime you decide to stop playin' patsy, give me a holler. Maybe we do some business. Peppo, don't call here no more. Stay out of my life! Got that? Stay out! Come on, Irving. What's up? Irving, how about something? Did he slip out and take off for Florida? Soon you may be wiping your feet on rocky's carpet. That's all I can say. How about somethin' more definite? I've got something to tell rocky. Good news? I've heard worse. He's getting his license back. No, but, uh... You get rocky. Rocky, it's Irving. Yeah? What? You ready? Here it is. It's all set-- July 16, Chicago, 15 rounds with Tony zale for the middleweight championship of the world. The commission wouldn't go along with New York. I ain't gonna fight in no Chicago ring. They hate me there. That's where some rat blew the whistle on me. They don't want me to win there! I gotta tell you that? What am I gonna do with him? You're gonna take him to Chicago and get him into shape. Then he'll take the title from Tony zale and show everybody who and what he is. It's Chicago. You heard him. He's got no stomach for fighting anywhere! Don't you see? For three years, he sweated hard, the only way he knew, trying to become a member of what he calls the legit world. He thought he'd made it. Now he's convinced whatever he tried didn't work, and what's the use of trying anymore if you're no good? But it did work, Irving, and it's got to work again! It's got to. Rocky! What's the matter with him? What are you doin'? Let me see those hands! We're supposed to be workin' out a defense for zale, and you're beatin' the heads off these poor stiffs and maybe breakin' a hand! So I made a mistake! How are they? I'd rather be hit by a train. Lucky. Here. Hey, where are you goin'? Look, it's too quiet here! I got to go someplace where there's some buildings and noise! Wait. I got an idea. You see, we'll set up shop in town. You'll work out in a gymnasium. They have one in the heart of Chicago. Maybe Chicago's got a heart, but I ain't found it. Can I quote you? You Chicago guys is nothin' but trouble for me! Well, I got my lead for tomorrow's column-- "rocky Graziano is a beaten fighter. Tony zale hasn't even laid a glove on him." Now what? Did you see that driver? I mean, not a word. He just looks at me in the mirror. What should he have said? "Good luck, rocky," or "drop dead" or somethin'. Maybe he didn't know who you were. Well, then what was he starin' for? He was probably wondering who does your hair. Did you hear what she said? I'd give her a shot she'd never forget! That certainly would have helped. Hello. A fine babysitter you are. Hi, darling. Who taught her to cheat at casino? Who do you think taught her? Wait till you see her take a dive in Jacks. Come, darling, kiss uncle Irving good night. Good night, cards and spades. Say good night to daddy. Good night, daddy. Yeah. Good night. Run to bed. How was the movie tonight, rocky? Tell him what that dame said. Go on, tell him! What's the difference what she said? Maybe some people never will forget who you were. Maybe it's the only way they get pleasure. You don't have to dance whenever they look at you sideways. We didn't bring you to make rocky worse. She didn't mean it, kid. I meant every word! He has got a past. It's time he learned to live with it. It's time we stopped looking the other way every time he gets into trouble. Rocky broke a regulation-- not the commissioner, not the district attorney. To listen to him, you'd think he's an innocent bystander. Please, Norma, I thought you wanted rocky to win. But what about the fights after that one? What about after he has to give up fighting? Norma-- I'm his wife, not his manager. I'm gonna be living with him after you've stopped worrying about him. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky. Yeah, I know-- what am I doin' here? Mix me a black and white. Sure. Sure, rocky. You always know how the phone book comes out in the end--zzybysky. Hello. Frankie Peppo, please. When he comes back, tell him to call-- you got a pencil? Bowling green 3-9970. Tell him to ask for rocky. Tell him... Tell him... If he still wants to talk, I'm willin' to listen. Yeah. You don't know how good it is to have you around, rocky. Oh, yeah, yeah. Come on. So many of the old gang are gone. Fidel killed in a holdup, Sammy doing 30 years, and shorty broke his spine driving a getaway car. Put more seltzer in this! Sure, rocky, sure. And frenchy they put away for life. Remember little frenchy and little parisi? He got the chair, you know. So did Tony and Willy esposito. It gets so quiet in here, you can hear the ice cream melt. You can make it more quiet! A prison cell is quieter. A grave has no sound at all, but what do I know? Nothing. Only that the world is not so different from my candy store. Someone comes in, asks for a soda. I give him a soda. He drinks it. He's got to pay for it. It's the same out there. He who wants a soda pays the check. You do something wrong, rocky, you got to pay the check. It's a very simple truth, yet some men find it difficult to understand. They get angry when time for payment comes. "Who me?" They cry. "For what?" For the soda. That's for what, rocky. Never ask for a soda unless you are prepared to pay the check. If a guy calls me, I'll call him back. Where are you going, rocky? Rocky. Hey, rocky. Hey, romolo. Well, what happened to you? I ain't feelin' so sharp. It's a temporary condition. You ok, rocky? Been worried about you. What's the matter? You hot? Ah, it's a temporary condition. Got big plans, rocky. Goin' into business for myself. Gonna buy a flower stand. Want to invest? Oh, yeah... How much? 100? A flower stand for 100 bucks? There's this warehouse over on Avenue a with an old grandpop night watchman. With a c-note, I can buy a heater, pay some slob to point it while I make a score. You got to get off this kick. You're gonna wind up dead! It ain't worth it. You can't make dough sellin' flowers. So who's gonna sell flowers? That's just a front, rocky. I'm gonna have me the prettiest bookie joint in the east side. All I need is a heater. You're gonna get killed if you don't turn a leaf! What's the use of turnin' the leaf? Look at you. You tried it, didn't you? We ain't got a chance-- guys like us, do we? Do we, rocky? Here. Get in there, you no-good little greaseball! I saw the light from downstairs, and I figured maybe somebody's still up. Your mother's at the seashore. So how you been? I mean, you look tired. Why don't you ask me how I've been? Why don't you ask me why I'm here? Your mother's not here now. Oh, you don't ask nothin'. You just tell things. Why don't you ask me like, how's Norma, or what I'm doin' here? If you don't like it, leave. That's all you can do is talk tough! You wasn't even tough enough to take the decision from Ma to hang up your gloves! You been fightin' that in your head ever since! You still ain't won, and you never will 'cause it's over for you no matter how much you drink! But it ain't over for me. I got a wife and kid, and I'm fightin' Tony zale for the championship of the world! I ain't gonna be decisioned out of nothin'! Hey, come on. Don't cry, will you? Look, pa, I was just talkin'. You don't have to take everything I say. Hey, look, I ain't so tough. You want to hit me? Come on, hit me. Look, pa, I was just talkin'! You couldn't help yourself none. You had nothin' but bad breaks. Me--I've been lucky. Come on. What could I do for you? Let me do somethin' for you. Be a champ... Like I never was. Don't worry about a thing. Pa, don't worry about a thing! Rocky, we were so worried about you. Where have you been all night? I went to get an ice-cream soda. Where? Well, Benny's. Where else? Look, are you all right? Oh, yeah. I feel good. What are you doin' up? We heard Chicago had beautiful sunrises. Listen to me. Do you realize-- what? What? Look, Norma, see that he gets some sleep, will you, please? What's this? I brought you some ice cream from Benny's. How did you know? How did I know what? That right now, next to you, the thing I've been dying to have is... Norma... Definitely? Ha ha ha! 15 rounds... For the middleweight championship of the world... Introducing, in black trunks, weighing 155 1/4, from New York City, the challenger-- Rocky Graziano! Boo! Boo! Boo! And in this corner, wearing purple trunks, weighing 159 pounds, the finest piece of steel ever to come out of Gary, Indiana, the middleweight champion of the world-- Tony zale! Yay! Yay! Yay! In just a few moments, two questions will be answered-- can rocky Graziano shake off every roof that's caved in on him and bounce back to take the title from the only man to ever knock him out, or will Tony zale prove he's a champion and go on to give Graziano the same beating that he gave him in yankee stadium last summer? The betting fraternity has made zale the favorite. Here comes the bell for the first round, and here's your blow-by-blow reporter, Sam Taub. Thank you, Harry wismer. There's the bell. Come on, Tony! Come on, Tony! Kill that bum, Tony! Hit him heavy, Tony! Come on! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Come on, Tony boy! Thatta boy! You can do it, Tony! Come on! You can do it! A right to the head, and another! Graziano is hurt. He tries to tie zale up. The champ steps back, comes in with another right to the head. There's the bell ending round 1, a very rocky round for Mr. Graziano. That guy hits hard. Well, hit him back. It's legal. Keep your left up. Shoot it up. Come on, zale, let him have it! Come on, Tony! Come on! Come on! Kill the bum! Kill the bum! A hard right by zale. The referee looks at Graziano's eye. The champ has him against the ropes. He's bleeding badly. His left eye is almost closed. Another hard right to the face! Come on, Tony boy, hit him. Come on, Tony! Come on! The left, Tony! Left to the body, Tony. Get up! I bet the hundred on you! He's up. There was no count. Lucky he heard you. Graziano is up. Zale drives a hard left to the body. A left high to the head. Another left. Fight him back. Fight him back. Graziano lands a left. Fight him back. Fight him back. Rocky's eye is raw. A hard right over the eye by zale. Another! Another! Rocky's in trouble. He's really in trouble now. Come on, zale! Let him have it! Come on, champ! Rocky. Rocky! Do you know who's talkin' to you? Whitey, I'm ashamed of you. I got him just where I want him. If this wasn't a championship fight, I'd stop it right here. They give you the chair for murder here. You stop this fight, I'll break every bone in your body! Not him. Not him. Him! Keep the left up. Keep this left up. Graziano misses with a left, takes a left jab to the face. Get him, Tony! Come on, rocky! Zale keeps throwing. He doesn't stop. A left to Graziano's head. Come on, Tony boy! There you go, kid. Keep going! Rocky, who am I? Who am I? Give me a hint. Ohh... That's Irving. Rocky, have you had it? What are you talkin' about? I got him. He's wide-open now. I'm going to bust his head open... This round. I think I'm beginnin' to believe you. Now go out there and nail him! Come on, Tony boy. Come on, zale. Let him have it. Boo! Come on! Boo! Come on, Tony! Come on! Use your left! You can do it! Keep going! Yay! Yay! Baby! Baby, your father is the champ! I have to go to the bathroom. The time, 2 minutes... And 10 seconds of the 6th round. The winner... And new middleweight champion of the world, rocky Graziano! Well, drink it all in while it lasts, honey. I'm going to be losin' this title someday. I'll be losin' the punch in this right hand, too. It's got to happen. But it don't make no difference. What I won they can't take away in no ring. You know, I been lucky. Somebody up there likes me. Somebody down here, too. ♪ I'm certain that somebody ♪ ♪ Yes, somebody ♪ ♪ Up there ♪ ♪ Likes me ♪♪
