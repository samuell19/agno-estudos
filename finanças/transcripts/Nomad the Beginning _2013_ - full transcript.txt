Ah! Yeah, I'm just getting home right now. I'm coming! I'm gonna have to call you... I said I'm coming! Calm down! What could be so important? Okay, I love you. Bye. Hello? I know about your brother. Tell me where he is. There will be a package waiting for you on mile marker 444 on route 66. Do you understand? Who is this? It must be delivered within 24 hours to Santa Monica. Where is my brother? You have 72 minutes to make the pickup. Your brother's life depends on it. Zitchen. Sir, I think that we have a situation on our hands here. What kind of situation? It's Eckles, sir. He didn't show up for work this morning. I searched his quarters, pretty much the entire base. Has the council been notified? - No. - Good. Keep it that way. I'll take care of this. Zitchen out. Who is this? Aurora. Response? Epsilon. Agent Dockins, you've been activated for a new assignment. Ah! Ah! Hey! Where's the package?! I think I've been in some kind of an accident! I can't remember anything! What do you know about my brother!? I'm sorry! I don't know you! I don't know your brother! Stop screwing around! Give me the package or the deal is off! I don't know anything about a package! Get in! What?! I'm not offering twice! Ah. You startled me. What's up, Dockins? How's the morning treatin' you? Fine. How's the stakeout? Oh man, you know how these federal investigations go. Long and slow. They got me tailin' some spiccano up here, next three weeks. So how'd that child custody thing work out for you? Any luck? Weekends or anything? Yo, man. Hey. You listenin' to me? What's the matter with you? Man, are you all right? Computer, lights on. Greetings, Agent 11. Running system diagnostic. Chamber operational level: 97 percent. Gelpacks charging. Downloading mission files. Target: Special Officer Christopher Eckles. Clearance level: Seven. Current status: Unknown. Presumed AWOL. Activate viewing chamber. Viewing chamber activated. Gelpacks charged. Your codename for this mission is... Nicodemus. I'm now entering the main line. Ah! I'm in. Tracing target signal. There's a great deal of back scatter. Where are you? It's hot. I can only see a few shapes... and I-I can hear... a vehicle traveling on a road somewhere. Mountains. No, we're in the desert. Hold on, I'm getting something. What is it? A mile marker. No... Something's wrong. Something's wrong with the target. It's as if the signal has been washed from the main line. I don't know how it's possible. Find him. What are you up to, Eckles? I gotta go get some supplies. Don't move. Who are you, lady? Christopher? Can I help you? I thought that was you. Chris, it's me Trenton. How long has it been? What are you doing off base? How do we know each other? What? You were there the day I was made. I've known you my whole life. But I thought you worked on base permanently. What is this? A special assignment? Where's your shirt? What kind of work do I do? I think I'm getting a call. I'll be right back. Somebody's gotten to him. Oh man, this is bad. This is really bad. I can't believe I have to turn him in. Why is he off base? Why doesn't he recognize me? They're gonna kill him. They have to. Nobody can know about us. Hey, Trenton. You'll never stop us. Hey. We should go. Just relax for a second. Turn around. Turn around. Where are we goin'? I can't tell you. So, uh, do you really remember nothing? Very little. I feel memories in there, like... like words on the tip of my tongue, but I can't get to 'em. Thanks. You found his chip? Who is this? My code name is Nicodemus. I'm the tracer assigned to you. What have you found, Agent Dockins? He was here. Very good. Zitchen will be in touch with further orders. One more thing, Nicodemus. Yes, Agent Dockins? Stay the hell outta my head. I'll try to do that, sir. What do you do for a living? Don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna get to know you. I've agreed to take you to where we're going. All I want is to know about my brother. And that's how far you and I go. I'm getting something. John, what's going on? Too fast. It's hard to follow. John! Wait... What's going on?! The nomad! John? Nomad. Nomad? No records of that name, sir. Did you get a position? Yes, and there's something else. What? A female. He's traveling with a woman. A woman? Find out who she is. Searching the database for her records. Marianna Alvarez. Searching for traceable electronic devices. Got it. I have located an active signal. Notify Dockins immediately. Understood. Here. So what did you mean back there? Mean by what? Nomad. I only remember parts of it. - What? - You don't trust me, do you? Why should I? For all I know, you took my brother and you're trying to do the same to me. So don't cross me, John. If that's even your real name. Who are you? Oh! Yeah, no, no, no. Everything's okay. I'm just saying... if you don't hear from me tomorrow, then... What are you doing? She has to go. The hell was that?! Hey, where are you going now? What are you doing?! That is part of my car! What are you doing?! Okay, that's it. They can trace us through your car's GPS computer and your cell phone! Who, John? Who can? I don't know, but I know they're looking for us. It wasn't safe. I was trying to protect us. Marianna, please don't leave me here. Look... I will help you find your brother. I promise. But I can't do it without you. What's this about? Ma'am, I'm a federal officer. I need you to step away from your vehicle. How do I know that badge is real? Ma'am, it is of the utmost importance I speak with you. You're in a grave amount of danger. All right, I'll hear what you have to say. What kind of danger? The man you're traveling with is a fugitive of the law. He escaped a federal facility last night, and I've been tracking him ever since. John! He's one of them You must save her! What was his crime? His crime? Well... he's about to commit a murder/suicide. Ah! Hey! John! Hello, sir. I understand we have a major problem. This is a very bad situation, Zitchen! Yes, sir, I am well aware of the gravity of the situation. The council is not happy. Your man has been compromised for over 14 hours! You kept us in the dark and didn't say anything to anyone. Yes, yes, of course. I apologize for not making the council aware sooner. Burn the site and everyone in it! Give me another 18 hours. I can handle this remotely. Using the current splinter cell. We do not need to burn the unit or the site. Now, you listen to me. We've been working on this deal for 50 years! I'm not gonna see it come to nothing! I understand that the covenant is still vey new and that they have not fully delivered on their end yet. Who do you think they're gonna go to next? Yes, I am aware that they will take this deal to the Russians or the Chinese next. Then handle it! Okay, sir, yes. I'll handle it. The covenant will not be compromised. Don't screw this up, Zitchen. Yes, sir, the problem will be handled within hours. Good. Take care of it. Thank you, sir. Thank you. What? Sir... there's been a development. John! John! John! John, stay with me! I'm gonna get you to the nearest hospital. No. No, they'll find us there. Is-is there anyplace else? Curtis! Curtis. Curtis. He doesn't live far from here. He can help you. They'll find us. Who will find us, John?! Tracers. John! John! Sir... Officer, are you all right? Where am I? Y-you're in the middle of nowhere, sir. Looks like you got hit in the face with a rock. What do you remember? Waking up this morning and having a drink. That's about it. Who are you? I'm Brad. What's your name, sir? Dockins. Okay. Well, Dockins, my wife and I were driving by and we thought you might need some help. Looks like you got messed up pretty bad. Oh, and I found these. Those don't look like mine. It's loaded. W-want me to call you an ambulance, sir? I think that's-that's coming from your pocket. Curtis? Curtis. - Marianna. My friend's been shot. He needs your help. Show me. Is he gonna be okay? He's lost a lot of blood... but none of his vital organs are damaged. He's pretty lucky. So... what have you gotten yourself into, Marianna? I cannot talk about it with you. It's better that way. C'mon. What's wrong? Curtis, you used to work for the military before you opened your practice, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Why? Um, in your time there did you ever hear of anything called tracers? Where did you hear that word? He said it in the car before he passed out. Marianna... I don't know what you've gotten yourself into... I mean, if this is true, you're dealing with levels of classified ops that not even the president is cleared for. What do you mean? There were rumors about a black ops division... psychic soldiers. They're called tracers. They can remote view from anywhere in the world. They get inside your head, they get any information they want: location, data, intel, you name it. How is that possible. How's anything possible? How's flight possible? Submarines? Atom bombs? Anything the human mind can conceive of, it's just a matter of time. That's not all of it. These tracers can elect to operate from a remote location, where there's minimum interference. It's the guys on the ground that you have to watch out for. Who are they? Ultras. They're programmed assassins. They kill and they don't remember anything. How? They take a subject... They torture them until the point of mental fracture. Two minds exist: one trained as an assassin, totally controlled by a puppet master... Look, I... I can't do this. I can't have him here. I'm sorry. - Yeah, I understand. Um... - Here. Give him these for the pain, okay? Thank you, Curtis. She knows. Can I help you? Why have you left us, Christopher? Who are you? You don't remember me, after all the years working hand-in-hand? Christopher, it's I, Laleeth. I'm right behind you. Why have you left us, Christopher? Christopher? Is that my real name? Yes. Who am I to you? A friend, and a liaison. The emissary for your leaders as I am the emissary for mine. We have worked together for years, you and I. How is it that I see you now? How is that possible? The genetic infusion that you received from us. You don't remember that either? We shared with you our telepathic gift so that you could communicate our wishes with your masters. This is how you and I are speaking together now. Come back, Christopher. Explain yourself. All will be forgiven. You're not human, are you? No... We are visitors here. You know that. Tell me, John... What is nomad? I don't know. Tell her nothing, John! She is your enemy! Stay back! You will be hunted down and executed. Nothing will stand in our way! No... No! No! No! No! Where am I? Where... - It's all right. It's all right. We're in a motel. You're safe. You got shot. It's okay. What's the matter? It's nothing. Don't worry about it. Come on. I just keep thinking about the last time I saw my brother. I didn't say "I love you" or- or anything like that. I wasn't even nice to him. We were just fighting about the stupidest thing. It didn't even matter. I was just... having a really bad day, and I just took it out on him. I just didn't think it was the last time I would see him, you know? That won't be the last time you see him. You have to believe that. What were you fighting about? He forgot my birthday... but he was busy. It doesn't matter. I don't even know how I got so mad. Ah, so stupid. Well, happy birthday. Thank you. I heard him again. Nomad. When? When I was dreaming. He warned me about this woman who wanted me to go back. Then I started remembering things. What do you remember, John? I work for the government. I was some sort of... liaison. To who? Not to who... to what. I don't expect you to believe me. John, I believe you. What's wrong? My wound. Sorry. What? They found you. You only have minutes! Who is this? A friend. You can call me Rook. You have to get out of there. Now! We have to go. Yes, Agent Dockins? There's nobody here. Your intel was wrong. Do not fail me again. Why are you following us? - I... - Not fast enough! Why are you trying to kill us? I don't know! I was just told to find two targets and eliminate them. I don't know anything about it. Who sent you? Zitchen. A man named Zitchen. Thanks. Are they dead? You tell me, Zitchen. Christopher, is that you? Why are you trying to kill me? I'm sure that's no mystery after what you've done, my boy. I'm not your boy. Is my soldier dead? Almost. We will find you, John. There's nowhere on this planet my tracers can't see. Tell me one thing, John. Tell me about... Nomad. I'm gonna stop you, Zitchen. I'm gonna stop all of you. What is it, John? I know this place. T-take this exit here. Here. Where are we, John? Maybe nobody's home. Let's just go. Can I help you? John? Hey, sis. I expected more from you, Agent Dockins. By failing to eliminate the target, you may have cost us all our lives and compromised everything I've worked for the past 30 years. I could still kill 'em. Just give me one more chance. Fine. You can't kill me, boy. I programmed you. I'm your creator. I am your god. Find them. You have one more chance, Agent Dockins. Don't fail me again. Now go. I can't believe you're here. You don't know how long Mom and Dad waited for this day. Mom, two years ago. Dad, a year after. I don't think Dad could go on living with both of you gone. Stephanie... who was I? What happened to me? You don't remember? You don't remember anything? He only has bits and pieces. He remembered this place, and he remembered you, but... I'm-I'm-I'm sorry, who are you again? We can't explain right now. Well, um... You were in the Air Force. A pilot. Mom and Dad's pride and joy. My big brother. My hero. You were 24 when you disappeared. You were on a mission... to the Middle East, but you couldn't talk much about it. Six months later they said your plane went down, but that no... body or wreckage was ever found. Mom wanted to have a funeral... for closure... but Dad wouldn't allow it. He said you were alive. He said that-that he could... feel you out there somewhere trying to get back to us. He believed that 'til the day he died. He even gave me this house... afterward, and told me to wait for you. Where have you been, John? Why come back now? I don't know. I don't know where I've been... or what happened to me... but if I could've made it home... I would have. Hello? It's for you. Who is this? It's Rook. What are you doing there? John, they're underway. My sister? Aw, man. What were you thinking?! All right, Al right, I'll try to deflect 'em. I'm not sure if I can. Leave right now, John! What's going on? I will come back. I'll explain then. I don't understand. I'm sorry. John, wait! You're an uncle. I love you, sis. I love you too. Come on. We gotta go. Sorry. I'm getting a house number. Oh! The image is changing. It's scrambling somehow. Highway... They're getting on the highway. Fuck it. Just get to the highway now. Right now! We're losing time! Marianna! Wait! Where are you going?! You're one of them! You took my brother! You've been part of this the whole time! I trusted you, John! Stop! Stop! You said it right there in the car! You knew all about him! I trusted you, John! He's dead, isn't he? I-I don't know. I don't understand all of it. You're just gonna have to believe... I'm done believing you! You lied to me! Run! Marianna! Stop! Don't do this, Dockins. You're not a killer. I'm not a what? What do you think I've been doin' the last 24 hours? Stock trades? I've been killing every single person you've come in contact with. And now, I'm aiming straight for the source. You do a lot of talking for an ultra. You're stalling. You think you know a lot, don't you? I do. I was there when Zitchen programmed you. Your name is Thomas Dockins You're an ex Navy SEAL. You have a wife. You have a daughter. What are you talking about? You're not a killer. You're a father. Think about Katie. You shut up! You don't mention her name! You'll only get one shot off! You're too far away for a guaranteed head shot. Fine. What are you suggesting? Let her go. I'll go 'round the bend. And we settle this man to man. Go. I'll come back for you, Marianna. I'll be back for you next. You don't have to do this, Thomas. You can walk away. Why should I listen to a man I have orders to kill? Because I used to work for the Council. I did terrible things, but I walked away. Make the right choice, Thomas. There is no right or wrong, there's only the mission! You're wrong, Thomas! Think about your daughter! Think about Katie! Don't you mention her again! Am I close enough for a head shot now, Eckles? You forgot about one thing. And what's that? Aurora. Respond. Fight it, Thomas. Fight it! Stop the car! Stop the car! You were hit in the head. - Stop the car! - Relax. I know I was hit in the head! I also know that you took my brother! Let me out! Let me out! - Stop. Look at me! - Stop the car! Look at me. Marianna, stop! Stop! Stop! Look at me! Stop! I don't understand or remember everything. But deep down inside, I know I'm a good person. And whatever happened to your brother, I'm here, because I wanna make that right. We're only a few hours away. I don't know why but I have to know about this Nomad. He's the answer to all this. If I was such a bad person, why not just leave you out in the desert? Just give me a few more hours... and you'll never have to see me again. And you will have all the answers you're seeking about your brother. Fine. Is he dead? Dockins? Yeah. Good. What do you have for me? Sir... Our asset has been compromised. And the target? What about Eckles? He and the woman... they're still on the move, sir. Track them. I've never seen LA before. Have you? I don't know. I can't be sure. Where are you going? We have to go to Santa Monica. Trust me. I saw something. There. What are we doing here? Just trust me. Rook. You just killed me. Come on in. Until you, John... I was Zitchen's only other runaway. And that was 25 years ago. I was the strongest tracer that had yet been developed. I was used for all sorts of things. Like you. And then I started figuring things out. And I started to develop... a slow but steady moral tumor inside me. I just couldn't take the guilt anymore. I had to make things right. How did you escape? I faked my own death. Like you, I started to use my abilities to dampen my memory, so the tracers couldn't track me. I left clues behind to a safe house that I already had set up. They haven't figured it out yet. But there is a way to dampen the location. Create a blind spot, so when they peek in, they can't see you. And after a while, they stop looking. Rook, do you know anything about my brother? Sorry. That was after my time. But he does. It's all right here. His memory's a little dampened. But it'll all come back to him. Then you'll have the info that you need. And how long will that take? It's hard to say. Why are you helping us? Because I wan an stop them too, John. I'm only one man. All I can do is sit and watch, but when I saw you were escaping, that's the moment I've been waiting for for 25 years. Rook... what is Nomad? I don't know. But you do. And you gotta find them at all costs. Because I believe he's the only one that can help us. Because what I see them doin'... will be the end of us all. Rook, what is it? What do you see? That's all I can tell you now. My time is up. I hope I haven't failed you. You tried to betray us, Christopher, but you failed. If I failed... then someone else will rise up to stop you. You don't understand, do you? This planet and its people are ours now. No one will stand in our way. Not even your precious Nomad. I remember everything now, Laleeth. Do you wanna know about Nomad? Traitor. Wake up and face execution. We will not see each other again. The gift will be given to another. John... Wake up! John! - Where are we? I don't know. We got trapped. Can you see? No. Shh. Shh, quiet. Welcome back, Christopher. I no longer go by that name you gave me, Zitchen. My name is John. Christopher... John... What does it matter at this point, Eckles? In a few minutes you're going to be dead. Why wait? I think you know exactly what I want. Look at this one. This poor innocent woman. And now she's going to die because you brought her into this. That sounds very selfish to me, Marianna. Don't you think? Leave her out of this! Why, John? Don't you think she's want to know about her brother and what you did to him? Shut up, Zitchen! This is between you and me. No, John... You did this. Wouldn't you like to know everything, Marianna? In the 40's... an alien ship crashed in Roswell. Out of that one crash, came... lasers, night vision, microprocessors. We were hooked. You see, the aliens, they don't talk like us. They use their minds. And so a human was chosen and infused with their DNA, giving him their telepathic gift. He was our emissary to their kind. That man was my father... and when he finally died, John here was recruited to replace him. John... negotiated the terms for our new covenant. What terms? This time we wanted their weapons. In exchange for what? Unlimited and unrestricted access to the population at large. They could keep them for good. Mutilate them... kill them... We didn't care anymore. Why would the United States do something like that? I don't work for the United States government. I work for the board of directors that owns and operates this United States, along with many other servile governments. The Council? Ah. This new covenant is what happened to your brother, Marianna. And John was part of the selection process for specimens. He practically hand-picked him out of the masses for experimentation. John, is that true? - Marianna. - Is that true?! Yes. What kind of experiments? A new species. Half human, half alien. And now... tell me, John... the thing I most want to know. Nomad. Go to hell. You first. Wait! I have something to tell you... but you need to come closer. Closer. What are you doing? Come closer. You don't ever touch my family! If you're one of them, then why are you helping us? I'm not like them. I come from a galaxy far more distant than theirs. I'm an explorer. When I came upon your world, I detected their presence, and I realized the threat to your young species. So I searched the planet with my mind, and I connected to one soul with the knowledge sufficient to stop them. I knew I had to get to Nomad... and his ship. Where is it? Just there beneath the waves. Why my brother? Why him? The hybrids, they were highly unstable. They lacked a key genetic sequence that would have perfected their race. We called it the grail. With the grail they would've created a slave race. No more need for you humans. We found that gene in one person. Your brother. It's true. I was on the team searching for the grail. But after what I saw they did to your brother... I knew I was on the wrong side, and I had to stop them. Without John, time would not have been on your brother's side. I knew I had to help him find you. That's why I called you. You were the only one I could rely on. And I was the only one who could help you. The day I called you, I wrote those things on my body, and I dampened my own memory so they could not trace us to Nomad. The day I left, I had your brother moved. This is his location. Is he still alive? I don't know. He is still alive. John, thank you! I will come back for you, Marianna. John... it's time to go. Carlos. Carlos. Marianna. Where am I? You're okay. You're safe now. What? Sir... A sweep team just found General Zitchen. He's dead. We tried to burn the unit, but the tracer had already escaped. Eckles? Where is he now? He and the woman got away, sir. Our satellites detected a spacecraft launch off the coat of California. And we think that that was them, sir. All right, that's all. Hey, it's me. Get the unit ready. No, no, no, wait a second. I'm leadin' this one. I need a ship, too. This is war.
