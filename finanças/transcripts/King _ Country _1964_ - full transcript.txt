Here dead lie we because we did not choose to live and shame the kind from which we sprung; Life 'after all' is nothing much to lose Though young men think it is, and we were young. Ha' ha, ha. What does this remind you of? Remind you of anything? You know when this war's over I think I'll get me a job in the sewer; well it's the same smell, the same company. The perfect soldier. Aye, the perfect soldier. Loved his country. Killed rats. - Killed lice. Went without food. - Without drink. Without sleep. - Without Went over the top. Killed the Kaiser, won the war. Home again. - Honourable discharge. Fat pension. - From his grateful country. Women waiting for him. - Children fondle him. Liquor is free for him. - He sleeps in the sun. Remind you of anything? Ha, ha, ha. I suppose they think I've let 'em down, Corp. No. I reckon I'm get a fair trial. Aye. It'll come out all right. Aye, course it'll come out all right. Well I'm sorry this lob had lo be wished on you, Charles. It's not your fault. If we weren't moving up so soon I suppose it could all be a bit more formal. That would make it all the more futile, wouldn't it? What? Well he is on trial for his life. That doesn't make him original we're all on trial for our lives. The only thing that makes him original is that he's failed. Failed as a man and as a soldier. The whole blasted thing's a waste of time. If a dog breaks its back, you don't sit around chatting all day, you shoot it. Er' excuse me, sir. - Oh yes, come on. What er what were you like as a child? The same. Is he in there? - Yes sir. Er, might I have a word with you, sir? He's no idea what could happen to him sir. At least, he don't give no sign of knowing. I suppose he's bound to know' he's bound to know what he did; he's bound to know what could happen to him. Have you been talking to him? Yes sir' a bit. I know it"s laid down we shouldn't. Shall I come sir? Is it necessary? No sir. My name's Hargreaves. - Yes sir, I know you, sir. Do you? - Trores Wood, sir. Worlencourt, sir, as well. How long have you been out here? Fourteen' sir. Best pan of three years. You know of course that you are entitled to the help of a defending officer. Oh yes sir. Soldier's Friend. I suppose I can be as much use to you as anybody else, subject of course to your acceptance. No objection? Oh no, sir. I'd, er I'd like to thank you, sir. It's not as if you have to do it, sir. Do you mind standing to attention when you are speaking to an officer. I didn't think it mattered in here, sir. Well it does matter. Pull yourself together, will you? Now you're Hamp, Arthur James, Age'? - 23, sir. Occupation? I I'm a soldier, sir. I mean in civilian life. Oh, er I had a trade, sir, Boot maker. Hand-made boots. I come from Islington. D'you know it, sir? Yes I know it. - Yeah? Were you were you a cobbler all your life? Since I left school, sir. - At what age? Twelve, sir. Started young, as they say. Were you a good one? Oh yeah' yeah. A good cobbler, yeah. Me father and grandfather were cobblers before I was, see. Me grandfather, he started it. - Are you married? Er' yes, sir. - Any children? Yes. ' sir - How many? One, sir. A little boy. Do you understand why I'm asking you these questions? You know best, sir. AH right, stand at ease. - Yes, sir. L, er... I I'd better ask you some questions about your about your home life. Home life? Well, we we never really had a proper home life, sir. Er, we always lived with her mother. Did you? Were you on sit down, sit down. - Oh' thank you, sir. Were you on good terms with your wife? Has somebody said something to you? Would you mind answering my question? About the wife? - Yes. She's took up with somebody else that's what I got told. Who told you? - I got a letter. A kind friend? - Yeah, Len. I see. - Len Wilson. Lives just a couple of doors away. Well that'll do for mitigating circumstances anyway. Sir? A reason. An understandable reason. - Oh. Did you keep the letter? - No sir, I hadn't thought. Did you, er did you er did you mention this letter to anyone else? Yes sir, I did. Yeah. Er, Willie Bryson Private Bryson in our platoon. Did you know him, sir? Er er no, I donâ€™t think I do. Oh. Yeah, he got killed, here at Paschendaele. Er, did this er, did this trouble with your wife have anything to do with the with er with what you're accused of doing? Er, no. sir. I never thought of it. Do you reckon maybe it was a reason even if I never thought of it? - I don't know. Thai's for you to tell me. Oh. I see. This kind of story's so often true that, er well you you could be lying. And I have to believe you before I can defend you, do you understand that? You can believe me, sir. It'll come out all right, sir. Why did you volunteer? - King and Country. Sir? Mm. They dared me. Who dared you? - The wife and her mother. They never thought I'd go. Yeah, I reckon it was that more than anything else. I wanted to surprise them. They got a surprise and all when I told them. And of course er we..we didn't know what it was going to be like' did we'? Well, I... I didn't think about it too much but I suppose you.. you reckon to yourself in my kind of life. Well, it can't be much worse than this, you know. Not you. sir. My sort and most of the lads. But we was wrong. Up there well H's worse than anything, isn't it? It's no worse for you than anyone else. I know that, sir, I know that. I'm only talking about it 'cause you're asking me. Go on. Well, when I volunteered we didn't know any better, did we? What d'you mean by that? Well, just a manner of speaking, sir. You'll have to learn to be careful of your manner of speaking. Yes, sir. Funny thing is the fellows I come out with do you know, there's none of them left except me Loos. Loos that was the first one. It was long side, that one. Trones Wood Gommycore Worlencourt Yeah. And now this one here. Passchendaele worse than anything. Have you been wounded? - Not properly, sir. I was bleeding a few times and there was one time I got sent down to a G.C.S. It was nothing much. They sent me back the next day. Of course you hear of fellows wishing they could lose an arm or a leg. Same as everybody else. I've heard of some of the lads that have tried it on themselves. Have you tried it? Sir? - Have you tried it? Oh, no sir, no Me and Willie er, Bryson, we was thinking of trying it once, but we never did. It... it wasn't long after that, that Willie's number come up. When? Here? Oh, oh, sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I've got to go some place. Corporal! Sir. - Latrines. Yes sir. - Go on. Come on Hamp. Right wheel. Sergeant, get the rest of your platoon outside with their gear for de-lousing. Come on, out. - Right, sir. Gear for de-lousing. All out for de-lousing! Come on! Come on outside for de-lousing. Outside with all your gear for de-lousing. Come on, out! Captain Hargreaves, prisoner's friend. Prisoner's friend. A fair trial. A fair trial and a quick death. - Very funny. Didn't you think it was funny? Not funny if you're in Hamp's shoes. Ready for you, sir. I mm you he was a strange one, sir. Attend to that, will you? I wouldn't be in Hamp's shoes. If I'd done it, I wouldn't have got caught. Right, get yer picks and shovels. I've got a }ob for yer. They still hanging around here, sir? Thanks for the smoke, sir. Did you expect to get away with it'? Well, I wasn't really thinking about it, sir, one way or the other. I just couldn't stand it anymore. It wasn't the first time, sir. - What? Well, I I nearly did it once before. I mean I thought of it. Time of Worlencourt. I got sent back on a water party. I I was thinking about getting away but an M.P. got his eye on me, so I didn't. And that was all? - Yes, sir. Supposing the others had, er cleared of-f and left you on your own at Loos or Trone's Wood? I don't think it could have been much worse, sir. All right then, we'll forget about that. Tell me about the the last time, the time you said you couldn't stand it anymore. What about that? Well, the time this really started going in my head, I got blown into a shell hole. Two of the lads pulled me out with their rifles. Well' I.. I.. I'd seen it happen to a bloke a couple of days before. He slipped off the duck boards into the hole, you see, and he's bobbing up and down in the mud you know, like an egg boiling in water, with his pack on and everything. Well I didn't help him, nobody did. It's laid down. So of course, when I gets m the mud I thought that was my lot, see. I was going to drown in it, like he did. Sucked into it, fighting it, drowning in it. Oh, after that I couldn't stand it anymore. But the battalion was relieved. You came back here for a rest. - Yes, sir. And you waited ten days until you went? Yes sir. - Why? Like I said sir, I can't say it any different. I couldn't stand it anymore. - What, even out of battle? It didn't matter where I was, sir. Any place I could hear guns. There's never anywhere where you can't hear them. Yes sir. Mr' Webb, he knew, he knew. He he gave me extra rum. Did you say anything to him about it? Not much, there wasn't nothing I could expect a gentleman in his position to do, sir. What he did, giving me extra rum, wouldn't have made any difference to what I did, I knew I wasn't going to go back. You mean you planned it? No, sir, no. I didn't have a plan. I haven't got the sense, have I? Maybe one time I would have had the sense but er mt er no, it's like being dead, sir. Why did you wait ten days? I don't know sir. I didn't have a plan. I went to the M.O. that time, yeah. And what did Dr. O'Sullivan say to you'? He gave me a number nine sir, for me bowels I spit it out when he wasn't looking. Maybe there was some sort of medicine that would have helped me but one thing I didn't have any need of was a number nine. And did he give you any other advice'? Well, he said I'd got cold feet, sir. He said I was a soldier and I should be a bloody soldier. Mind you' I... I I didn't expect any different. I didn't expect him to say anything except what he did. Why did you so? Well, I thought he might give me some sort of tonic, something sir, to stop me diarrhoea, stop me shaking, help me sleep. It wouldn't have make any difference to what I did. I knew I wasn't going to go back up the line. Did you know the battalion was going back into the line before you went? Yes, sir. Is that what finally decided you? No, sir. - Then what did decide you'? I dunno. I just started walking walking away from the guns. Did you know where you were walking to? No... no. After I got a few miles away from the guns I got it into my head that I was making for home, Islington you know. Er... Er. didn't make any sense but that's what I got in my head. I must have walked a long way because I remember I took me boots off and me mg toe was kneading. Then I was in a cart sitting on some potatoes. Then I was in a train and some fellows was er was was playing cards. Then I was wanking again. Then I was talking to this priest but he was foreign. I didn't know what he was talking about. It... it was like a dream sir. I... I didn't know what was really happening and what wasn't' Weren't you ever challenged? Only when they picked me-up. Not till then'? - Oh' no no. Didn't you hide in ditches and things to avoid them? Oh, no, sir. No no. Did they say anything to you when they arrested you? Well, er just about me being a deserter and I heard one of them saying to the other about it being a shooting job. Nothing else? Well you see, there's nobody left in 'A' company that's been out here as long as me, sir, so they can't shoot me. It's likely that you will be found guilty of desertion. And I'd be failing in my duty if I left the least shadow of doubt in your mind as to the consequences. Well I don't reckon I'll get off, sir, but they they can't shoot me. Unless I can convince the court that you were acting under extra ordinary strain at the time when you committed this crime, you will almost certainly be sentenced to death. This was the first time sir. Mr. Webb; sir' he said I hadn't been a bad soldier. He might say the same to them if he was asked. Yes, he might Yes, I thought that was worth mentioning, sir. Can you think of anything else that was worth mentioning? Er no, sir, no. Did did I tell you about Willie? Bryson yes, you told me about that. Well, about about when Willie was was killed? You told me that he had been killed. Well, I don't know if you can, er if you can tell them about something like that. Well, it's important for you to tell me. Well you see, I was alongside of him when it happened. Same as many a time before, five' six yards away. H wasn't the first time I seen a man blown to bits of course, it wasn't even as if Willie was anything special to me. Well, just a bit, you know, because he came from up our street. But that's all, I mean nothing special One thing about Willie, it was quick. I never saw it, sir, I was five or six yards away I turns around and old Willie's nowhere, except over me. Ooh, I tell you, they had to get me a new uniform. This is a this is a question that I may have to ask you in court, sir. I'm going to ask you now, If they, er were lenient enough to send you to prison, could you be relied upon to do your duty when you come out? Well I'd try my best. sir. - I don't mean that. Could you be relied onto go up the line, and stay up the line. I mean that exactly, nothing, less. Do you understand me? - Yes sir. Well'? Do I have to tell you the truth sir? Could you? Can you tell me sir? Can you tell me any way of being sure? Prisoner's ready, sir. Shouldn't take long, sir. It's a bad business. Who's in charge of the er later formalities? One thing at a time, Sergeant Manor. Yes, sir. Give us a hand with this. What is it? Horse or mule? - Pig. If we was left to ourselves, we'd all be home in bed having it, wouldn't we? I didn't say anything about - Wouldn't we? You can't win a war lying in bed, can you? No but - So you do what you're told. Doesn't make sense. - That's not our fault, is it? Keep an eye open: cook. - Pity to waste it on that lot. Where's the best bit? - This bit. Chopper. Knife. Dixie. Right, well now we'll see what we can do for our officers. The Brass have gathered. - How's Hamp? Oh they've got him all spruced up like for his wedding. Cut himself shaving of course. Him; we just push him over and watch him sink. They won't do it. Do you think they will, sir? - No. I think he's had it. I'm afraid he's had his mt. Are you going to get the silly bastard off, do you think'? He thinks so. - I hope he's right. I'll shall certainly do my best. Oh don't misunderstand, my interest is purely personal. I don't want my men used as a firing squad. And I certainly don't want to be the Joe Bloody Soap who has to shout 'fire" Why you? - Oh I'm number one on the Colonel's Sweat List at the moment' I see. - When it comes to my turn, I'll perjure myself for the man if you like. The truth will do. Good luck my learned friend. Prisoner and escort Halt! By the right turn! Private Hamp cap off. Corporal. Prisoner and escort left turn. Quick march left. Left, right Left wheel Prisoner and escort halt! Left turn. 873426 Private Hamp, sir. Is that your name and number? - Yes sir. Mr Prescott, would you pass me that? The accused, no. 873426 Private Hamp' Arthur James, Soldier of the Regular Forces, you are charged with when on active service er... attempting to desert His Majesty's Service. In that you absented yourself from duty without orders from your superior officer, from approximately 0700 hours on October 10th this year at a mace called Jackdaw Tunnel until October the 11th this year when you were arrested by the military police at Calais. Guilty or not guilty? - Not guilty, sir. Speak up. - Not guilty sir. Very well. I have to ask you if you object to any members of the court? Myself or either of these two officers? I am surprised, sir' that as convening officer, you are also president of the Court Martial. There are no other field officers available, Captain Hargreaves, I must appoint myself. Are you making a formal objection? No sir. You may stand at ease, Private Hamp. Well sir, I've spoken to Captain Midgeley and we've agreed that I won't dispute the facts of the case. So all the witnesses will be called by the defense. Good. That will save the Courts time' I submit that the prisoner absented himself at a time when, because of his mental health' he was not fully responsible for his actions. Mental health, Captain Hargreaves. Do you mean that the prisoner is lunatic? No: sir. - Or mentally deficient? No, sir. There must be hundreds of thousands of men who are in an unhappy mental state but who have not absented themselves from their duty. I realise that sir' fully. I assure you. Are you ready for your first witness? Yes sir. Call Corporal Hamilton. Corporal Hamilton. - Sir. Halt Hold the Book in your right hand. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I swear by Almighty God that the evidence I shall give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Corporal Hamilton, I believe that you apprehended the prisoner? - Yes sir. What did he say to you? - Not much, sir. Only Well he tried to tell us he was going on leave, of course. Yes. A soldier going on leave is required to carry with him a full pack and equipment, is he not? - Yes sir. And the prisoner was carrying? Gas helmet, rifle and bandoleer, sir. Wouldn't have stood much chance of getting on board a leave ship in that gear, would he? No, sir. Rather a silly story, wasn't it? Yes, sir. Then how do you account for it? Well sir, he could have, for all I know he could have been just stupid. Gives us the day off, though' doesn't it'? I'm not going up to the front and leave that bloody bastard behind me alive. Bloody, bloody rats! Corporal Hamilton, I presume that during the course of your duty you have arrested other deserters, of other men who have absented themselves from service? Yes, sir. Quite a few, sir. Did any of them behave in the same way as this prisoner? Much the same, sir. In particular, did some of them, to use your own words, did some of them appear to you to be stupid'? Or behaving as if they were dazed? Yes sir' I suppose so. In short, was there anything remarkable or extraordinary about this prisoner compared with others? Well, if there had have been something extraordinary you would have thought about it, wouldn't you? The thing that surprised me sir, was how he got as far as us. By rights he shouldn't have had a hope. He must've been through places thick with patrols like Poperinghe and that. Perhaps he wasn't quite as simple as he seemed. No, sir. I didn't mean - After all, he did get very close to an embarkation point, didn't he? That's all Corporal, no more questions. Thank you, sir. Look at that! There must be dozens of them in there, and too full to be nippy. Shall I jump on it? - No! Right. When I say 'Now' thump the belly. Now! Captain O'Sullivan, do you remember the prisoner reporting sick to you on or about October 8th of this year? On the 7th, yes. I looked it up. Of what did he complain? I remember quite clearly. He complained of nerves. - Nerves. He didn't tell you he that he was finding it impossible to sleep'? He may have. Yes, I believe he did. But you didn't take this very seriously? No, ifs not uncommon. It certainly isn't uncommon for me to be told such things. You mean you didn't believe him? Oh I didn't say that. Every Medical Officer hears this kind of thing five or six times a day. Did you believe this man? ' Why r-wot? It seems a permissible question. - Why not'? Why didn't you believe him when he said he couldn't sleep? I didn't say I didn't believe that. Very well. Of what other symptoms did he complain? Well, he said he was off his food. Said he was feeling a bit shaky. - Shaky. Uncontrollable bouts of trembling? I don't know about "uncontrollable? You don'! know about it but did you bother to find out? Are you challenging my competence? I don't want to interfere with your defense, Captain Hargreaves but must you attack the witness? It's not Captain O'Sullivan's competence which is at stake, sir, it's this man's life. You said you didn't believe him; what didn't you believe? Oh dammit, Charlie, I knew what he was after. Did this man lie to you, and if so what did he say? I knew what he wanted' to be sent down the line. Did he say so? - Did he what? Did he ask to be relieved from duty? Not in so many words, of course he didn't. And er how long did this interview last with him? Five minutes ten minutes. And after that you lost interest in the man'? Well what do you expect me to do? I haven't got time for everyone's emotional problems. But you were sure that an interview for five or ten minutes was sufficient for this case? Yes. - Why were you so sure? Experience. My own judgement, of course experience. And you usually prescribe the same treatment? More or Mess. More or less. Laxative pills. A good dean out never hurt anybody. Is that the only relief you can offer a man, laxative pills? I'll prescribe one for you in a minute. Captain O'Sullivan, were laxative pills in the slightest degree relevant to what was wrong with this man? There was nothing wrong with him and I told him so Did you? What did you say? I talked to him man to man. I told him he wasn't the first soldier to feel a bit jumpy. I told him he'd be alright, back to normal I told him to try to eat, to try to get some sleep. Well what else could I say? I told him to pull himself together. Has the incidence of medical reports of this sort been growing recently? I haven't got time for statistics. Or diagnoses, it seems. - No. No, no, no. What are the symptoms of shell-shock? Shell-shock is a different matter altogether. Is there an exact moment in the life of a soldier before which he is not suffering from shell-shock and after which he is? An exact boundary about which no two doctors will ever disagree? An exact boundary on the one side of which a man is required by Army law to "pull himself together." Or on the other if he cannot, is liable lo be shot as a criminal. Is there? This has nothing whatever to do with what we're all here for. I must say Captain Hargreaves, I agree with that' Do you sir? Then what are we here for? A mock trial'? That remarks entirely improper, Captain Hargreaves. I apologise, sir. Proceed. Does the term 'shell-shock' have an exact medical meaning? Yes, of course it has. And a 'five or ten minute' examination is quite sufficient time in your estimation to judge whether a man is or is not suffering from shell-shock? It is not my job to maintain a Bedlam. God knows you of all people should realise I've got no time for such rubbish. Do you expect me to heave wounded soldiers to die while I cross question cowards? What I am asking is is there not a borderline? This is not a borderline case of anything, how many times have I got to tell you? This was a case of cold feet, funk, miserable funk, nothing more or less. Are you sure? - Yes' I ask you most earnestly, are you absolutely sure? How could a man responsible for his actions do such a hopeless. Desperately stupid thing as this man? When they found him, he was trying to walk home to England. He might just as well have tried to clear a German trench single-handed. Is it not obvious to you that this man had lost possession of himself? You've made your point, Captain Hargreaves. Have you any more questions for Captain O'Sullivan? No sir. Captain Midgeley. - Er, yes, sir, if you please. Captain O'Sullivan, have any of the Defending Officer's questions altered the conclusion you came to about the prisoner when he reported to you on October the 7th? No, not in the slightest. In view of the speculation we have heard' will you now tell the court in your own words what that conclusion was? - Yes' I found the prisoner fit for duty, provided he was kept under discipline and discouraged from malingering. And there's nothing you wish to add to your judgement now by way of qualification? Nothing whatever. He's proved me right' hasn't he'? And that's all there is to say about it. He did tum and run, didn't he? Thank you, Captain O'Sullivan. Were you in the area between our billet and the cook-house at 1600 hours today? Yes, he admits he was in the area between our billet and the cook-house at 1500 hours today. Right Did you or did you not crawl up to Private Sparrow and take a bite out of his ear-hole? No he did not crawl up the Private Sparrow and take a bite out of his ear-hole. Right. Now one last question, if you had been in our billet today, would you have done a thing like that? No, he's not that sort of a rat. Captain Midgley, would you like to cross-examine the accused? You've been telling a lot of bloody hes' haven'! you'? No, no, I haven't been telling a lot of bloody lies. You're just an ordinary rat who only eats dead flesh, mm? Mm, I'm just a normal rat. Well then, if you're just a normal rat who only eats dead flesh why, when all the other rats were coming out of the front end, what were you doing coming out of the back end'? Oh, he's crying. - Ah and after that his nerve had gone? Absolutely. I imagine there were others of your men in a similar condition at that time; were there not? Well he must have been in a worse way than any of the others, sir. But we dent know that he was in any worse condition than his comrades; we only know what he decided to do about it. With respect sir, he did not 'decide' to do it- if you'll let me carry on.. - Continue. Was the prisoner popular in his platoon? Oh yes. He always shared anything he had, and he's the nearest thing we've got left to a founder member, of course. And he... Yes? Well I was just going to say.. I don't suppose it matters.. but er.. He brewed a damn good cup of tea. Was he a good soldier before this happened? First-class. Near enough. Not a born soldier' but first-class. And you were surprised when you heard that he'd absconded? Oh yes I was. From what you know of him, you believe he'd have to be a little unhinged to do what he did? Yes.. I do. Thank you. No more questions sir. - Captain Midgley? First-class soldier. - Yes. His record Is singularly blank. Neither good nor bad. His principal talent as soldier seems to be in staying alive. Well, surely we're not trying a man for staying alive, are we? The War hasn't got to that stage, has it? Mr. Webb. Hargreaves here is the sole survivor of an assault on the Somme. They didn't try him for that. You'll confine yourself to answering questions, Mr. Webb. I beg your pardon sir. Mr. Webb, about this mental unhinging did you see any actual sign of it yourself? Well, it depends. - I mean if it had it surely would have been your duty to see that something was done about it wouldn't it? Did the idea occur to you before he went absent? No.. but he could have been ill in his mind even if I didn't see it beforehand. Can you offer any evidence that he was? He'd had & bedtime. Er well I don't blame him. We all get the wind up sometimes. I much prefer a man to boll beforehand rather than crack up under fire and endanger a whole platoon. Mr. Webb. Isn't it true to say, however much we may regret it, however much we may sympathise, isn't it true to say that this man simply allowed his fear to become his master? There's more in it than that. I ask you again. Can you recall any evidence to support what you say? I've said what I believe. Thank you, Mr. Webb. No more questions, thank you, sir' Very well. - Sir. Got it. Got it! Broke its bloody back! It's as though the Devil's got hold of me legs He's pulling me down. I'm not even wounded. Pm not even wounded but I'm going to be drowned in the mud. Oh, something had it in for me, I knew that. Did this idea that the Devil was after you did it stay in your mind after you'd been rescued from the mud? Not in the same way, sir. no. So it wasn't the Devil. Then why did you run away? I didn't run sir. I walked. I just started walking. I dunno why. It's it's not true to say is it that you deliberately decided to desert that you deliberately decided and hoped to gel away with it'? I wasn't really thinking about it, sir. No. I know you weren't thinking about it. No but I was hoping they wouldn't get me, of course. But you really weren't you weren't clearly thinking of anything at the time, were you? I just wanted to getaway from the guns, sir. Had you any idea where you were going? No sir not really. I just wanted to get left alone for a bit, that's all. Private Hamp you say you wanted to be left alone for a bit. Does that mean you intended to return to the battalion? I don't know sir. That's because you you don't remember anything very dearly, isn't it? That's right sir. Yeah. You had no clear man or reason in your mind, did you? I just started going, sir. I, ya know I couldn't help myself. Well like you told me to say, sir, I was acting under extraordinary strain I er... I er, can't think of anything else sir. Is it all right if I ask you a question, sir? Yes, carry on. Well, I, I'd sooner you tell them sir. You know more about it than me. All right. Any more questions, Captain Hargreaves? No, thank you sir. Captain Midgley. Private Hamp, did you know you were doing wrong when you deserted? If anyone'd tried to stop me I'd have stayed, sir. Well didn't you wait until you'd made sure that there was nobody thereto stop you'? No, er, well I think I was just lucky, sir. That's very much a matter of opinion. Look' what I really want to know is this. You did know, didn't you, that it was your duty to stay with your battalion? Yes sir. - And you must have been very well aware of that all the time you were absent from the first moment you decided to decided to have. I I don't know sir. But you could walk, talk think like anybody else. And you managed to get quite a long way, didn't you? Like I just said, sir, I was lucky. Well let me put this to you quite simply, did you know what you were doing? I I knew what I was doing, sir And you realised that you were leaving your comrades at their posts who were prepared to do their duty while you deserted them. Didn't you? Didn't you? I've never done this before sir. This was the first time. No more questions sir. That'll do, Private Hamp Captain Hargreaves will you address the court now on the prisoner's behalf? No sir. I will address the court on its behalf. The prisoner, when he did the thing for which he's being tried was no longer responsible for his actions. This court is responsible for its actions. It has not lost possession of itself. This Court knows clearly what it's doing. This Court has the power to choose. Private Hamp is not a liar. He's not glib, he has no ready answers. He has an embarrassing honesty which made him a bad witness in his own case. He could have put a bullet through his leg and suffered nothing more serious than a term of imprisonment. He even told me he thought of doing so. But he didn't. He stayed. A deserter in full consciousness of what he is doing, runs away to save his own skin and leaves his fellows to do the fighting and the dying for him. This man is not a deserter. He volunteered. He volunteered because his wife and her mother dared him to. Never mind - he volunteered. He's been out here for three years. Longer, if I may say so, than some of us have been. He's seen it all. A man can only take so much. So much blood. So much filth. So much dying. In the shell hole he thought he was drowning in the mud He thought his time had come and it had. After that he was no longer responsible for his actions. He hadn't got the power to decide whether to stay or to go. He had one instinct only left the instinct to walk. To walk home To walk away from the guns. They've become a fact of our daily lives. So much so that we no longer ask each other why they're being fired. Is this war so old and are we so old in it that we've forgotten? Are we not fighting to preserve some notion of decency? Some notion of justice? To preserve for this Court the right to choose? I beg to remind the Court, if justice is not done to one man, then other men are dying for nothing. Matter of opinion. Prescott. You as our legal member advise the court on the law as it applies to this case. The Court will remember that the soldier takes the law of England with him wherever he goes, and he's protected by it. The accused does not have to prove himself innocent; the prosecution must prove him guilty. If the members of the Court have any reasonable doubt but it must not be a fanciful doubt, they must give him the benefit of it. You have before you the opinion of the Battalion Medical Officer which is that at the time the prisoner left the Battalion he was fit for duty and was not shell shocked but only suffering from what the doctor described as 'cold feet. ' You must not be unduly swayed by the eloquence of the Defending Officer, who has quite properly made out the best case he can. If doubt that the prisoner really meant to desert, and you believe that he merely went absent without leave and intended to return after a few days, you will give a verdict accordingly. On the other hand, if you are satisfied that the prisoner really deserted, it is your duty to find him guilty. As to the stress the Defending Officer laid upon the prisoner being a volunteer, neither must you be unduly swayed by that. The Army is now composed of regulars, of volunteers and of conscripts, and one law applies to them all. And it is the Court's duty to administer the law as it stands. We will proceed immediately to our discussion of the case. Private Hamp, 'shun. - Thank you Captain Midgley, Captain Hargreaves. Escort fall in on the right of the prisoner. Prisoner and escort left turn. Quick march. Left right, left, right left Thanks for cutting my throat, old boy. Well you were overdoing it a bit, I couldn't help n. I thought there was a great deal in what you said if I may say so. Thank you. - You did very well, Hargreaves, I hope you got him off. - I hope so too. But you know, a proper Court is concerned with law. Ifs a bit amateur to plead for justice. What do you want now, then? Have you seen my rifle, Corp? Well why would you be wanting that? Well I just thought I might give it a clean. You know, something to do. The way they did the Court Martial it could be anybody You know, I kept forgetting they was talking about me. Er er Mr. Hargreaves, he gave them a lovely speech. "This man is not a deserter." Oh... You've been twice since you got back already. It's not my fault, is it? Right. Guard. Corporal. - Latrine' Right wheel Help yourself, Mr. Morris. Stand easy, Mr. Prescott. Hm. Mr' Morris wishes to know whether we can find the prisoner guilty and recommend mercy. Yes sir, you may. And you may either confirm the sentence yourself or send it to a higher authority for confirmation. I see. Mr Prescott. Never mind. - Thank you. Er would you help Captain Cartwright prepare a finding? Er guilty of desertion but emphasise good conduct, length of service' that kind of thing but don't put in anything about mental health. They're not interested in that sort of thing at Headquarters. When you've finished, have it read to the prisoner and then send it off for confirmation. Right, gentlemen. Won't know anything for a bit yet. It's got to go to the Generals and that lot. It'll be a week then. They're all pinned down in Paris, you know. What's Hamp thinking, I wonder. If he's got any sense, he's not thinking Whatever happens he's not going up the line again. Do you know what he said when he got back? "They're taking a lot of trouble over me." Feels bloody honoured, he does. Yes, they're taking twenty four hours to kill him. Jerry wouldn't take that long. He'll get the glasshouse. Captain Hargreaves, sir. - Yes. I don't know if it's allowed, sir, but he says he'd like to see you. Who? - Private Hamp, sir. Would that be legal, Mr. Prescott? Well, I I'm afraid it would be highly irregular, sir. It would be kind. All right, I'm coming. Yes. - Messages for the Colonel, sir. I see. Come with me. Excuse me, sir. Message, sir. - Ah, thank you Mr. Webb. Er go and get yourself something to eat, Corporal. Thank you, sir. Gentlemen, your attention, please. The Battalion will be moving into the line tomorrow morning at 06:00 hours. We will be reinforcing a battalion of the Munster Fusiliers. Captain Cartwright, would you ask all Company Commanders to come to my billet after dinner at er... 20:00 hours? Right, sir. - Thank you, gentlemen. Well, Hamp? Sir. Er.. it's just that I'd like to thank you, sir. Er, in case er well you know I expect I'll get put in military prison, you know, and er in case I don't see you for a while. We, er we don't know where you'll be put, if you're put anywhere. Well anyway, sir, I I wouldn't like to miss thanking you You've taught me a lot of things, sir, and I'm very grateful. Have I? Rather too late, I fear. AH right, thank you. You, er... you haven't heard anything, have you, sir? No. I mean, after what you said they couldn't help but well it was the truth. That's what I'm trying to say. Nearly everything you said I could never have said it. No, I mean it sir. It was my duty to s ay it. Oh, I don't know about that, sir. It was my duty. If you'd remembered your duty none of this idiotic rigmarole would have been necessary. Cant you get that into your head. Don't thank me for doing my duty. I had to just as you should have done yours' Yes, sir. It's not as if I haven't thought about it, sir I have. I know what they could do to me. It's just that er I wouldn't be thinking I stood a chance if it hadn't been for you. Prisoner shun. With your permission, sir. Yes. Private Hamp, A.J., Number 873426, it is my duty to inform you that the General Officer Commanding in Chief has confirmed the sentence passed on you by the Field General Court Martial. You will suffer death by shooting on Thursday, October 22nd, at 05:30 hours. When's that sir? Tomorrow. More wine, Midgley? Er no thank you sir. Would you excuse me now, sir? Yes of course. - Thank you, sir. Some Haig over there. Pure chlorine. Oh, beg your pardon sir. Rather shod on ceremony, aren't we? Yes, sir. I had too much of that today. You know the verdict? Just now. You lost. We all lost. We're bloody murderers. Don't be idiotic, Charles. Pull yourself together. Pull yourself together pull yourself together. That's what they said to him today. Pull yourself together, you're talking like a bloody doctor. Aren't we rather overstepping, old boy? All right. I'm sorry. But er why? Hm? Actually why? Why? - Mm. Was it O'Sullivan's evidence? You know he's an idiot. Was was it my defense? I... I did my best. Very eloquent, Charles. But nothing to do with the facts. Facts, facts, facts. You 're going to shoot that poor little bastard simply because he went for a walk. That's all it was, you know. It was a technical desertion but just a a bloody little walk, really. And you know it. Don't you? These facts â€œyour battalion moving up tomorrow important to maintain morale. Sentence of death to be carried out immediately." 0 my God. Pour encourager les autres, eh? Has it ever encouraged anyone? Discouraged anyone? Of course it has. Are you sure'? No not quite. Who's in charge tomorrow? Jack Webb. His man, his platoon, his mistake. Teach him a lesson. By the way, I've written the next of kin letter, I wonder would you mind giving it to Webb as you go out? â€œThere's a porpoise close behind me And it's treading on my tailâ€œ Huh? Facts. "When I am buried and all my thoughts and acts Will be reduced to lists and dales and facts, And long before this wondering flesh is rotten The dates that made me will be all forgotten." Hamp! Hamp! Is that you, Corp? - Aye. Now listen up. Wilson and your lot, they've been nicking some rum. Oh. - Aye. We've got some of the good stuff and all, mate. Thinking about a booze up tonight, you know. Well I thought you were bringing it. No. - Well where's rest of them? Coming. - You'll get into trouble No to hell with that, man. Shut the door. What's this for, then? Somebody's birthday? Is he very religious? I don't think so. Official C. of E but You'll be staying with him right through the night? Of course, if he's willing. Yes, well, I've laid on something which might prove just as useful How does the idea strike you? It's not for me to say. Well I've spoken to the 0.0. It's left to his discretion and he's left it to me. So he said he said, that man in bed with my wife was me. Was me. There is no disgrace no disgrace at all. Here today gone tomorrow. It doesn't mailer who kills you, does n? Well you know, you you've lived a long life, Hamp, and you're due. You'll rot tn the mud, and that's that. It doesn't matter what anyone bloody well thinks about it, does it? Hey, we're all moving up soon. We'll be in the same boat as you are. We'll all be rat food, before long. Last drink in bottle. Who's going to get it? You'd think I was entitled to it. Fire! Come on. Come on. - Right' Come on. Come on. Give it here. - Come on' All right, open up. Where are you, you bastards? Will you let me try to help you? Do you want to talk to me? God decides when it is our turn to be taken to him. Will you be absolved of your sins? My sins? My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth, he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth. Our Lord Jesus Christ, who has left power to his church to absolve all sinners who truly repent and believe in him of His great mercy forgives thee thine of fences and by His authority committed to me; I absolve thee from all thy sins in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. We do not presume to come to this thy table, 0 merciful Lord, trusting in our own righteousness, but in Thy manifold and great mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather the crumbs from under Thy table But Thou art the same Lord whose property is always to have mercy. Grant us therefore, gracious Lord, so to eat the flesh of thy dear Son Jesus Christ and to drink his blood that our sinful bodies may be made clean by His body and our souls washed through His most precious Blood and that we may evermore dwell in him end He in us. Amen. The body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was shed for thee preserve thy soul unto everlasting life. Well where's the soul, Padre? Here. AH that's left here is a few hours of moody nothing. Aaaaah! This ground Oh will grow Oh will grow no more buttercups. Oh Quick march. Left right, left right, left right, left Left wheel Squad hah. Left turn. Break it up. Break it up. Escort dismiss! Left right, left right, left right, left Fill the gap! Squad squad 'shun.
