(calm music) (soft, gentle music) (alarm beeping) (energetic music) (alarm ringing) - Dad. (man groans) Dad, are you up yet? - 'Course I'm up. Just looking for my shoe. - [Announcer] And today's weather. On the coast there is sunshine and showers. Temperatures mild with a high of 20 degrees. So if you're up out that swimming this morning, take a brolly. Stay dry. Stay cool with this. (mellow music) - Breakfast on the table. - I can't find my shirt. - Shaving cream on your ear. _ Huh? - Dad. - I can't find my briefcase. I can't go to... - Off you go. - Thanks. See you tonight. I'll pick you up from Hannah's. (dad exclaims) Thanks. Ta. (driving music) Is he here yet? - Oh, yeah. - What sort of mood's he in? - [Man] I've made my position perfectly clear. I don't want to talk about it anymore, okay? Now get out. - Need I say more? - Oh, Mr. Shepherd. So kind of you to grace us with your presence. - What happened? - He sacked me. - You're kidding. - He sacked me like that. - I don't believe it. - 19 years. - Sacked you for what? - For complaining about this. - They're not seriously thinking of building that, are they? - [Fired Man] They surely are. - [Mr. Shepherd] It's hideous. - Oh, but you better not complain about it. Or the only thing you'll be drawing is the dole, like me. Well, it's been a treat working with you boys. But all good things, eh? If my wife calls, tell her I'm at the bottom of the river. Or in the pub. (driving music) - Ronnie. Wait. - I've had it with this place. - Let me talk to him. - What's the point? The man's a fool. I'll see you around, Steve. (soft knocking) - What is it? - Mr. Cowie. - Oh, drop it, Shepherd. Your friend's a troublemaker. - Well, I think you're mad to let him go. - It's none of your business, son. We hired an architect, not a critic. - But he was right. I mean, give us a break. - Leave it, will you? It's nothing to do with you. If you know what's good for you, just leave it. (soft music) - Okay. What is it? What's happened? - Hmm? - You haven't said a word since you got in. - Ronnie got the sack today. - Ronnie? What did he do? - Told the boss he wasn't happy with the design he's working on. Some ugly gray block of flats. - He got the sack just for that? That's terrible. Didn't you say anything? - Yeah, of course I did. I marched right in there and told the boss exactly what I thought. - And what happened? - Threw me out of his office. - That's not fair. - Cowie never listens to what I've got to say. It's hopeless. - Isn't there anyone else you can complain to? - What? You mean go to Cowie's boss? - Yeah. The man in charge of the whole company. That's the person you should talk to. - Hmm, Horace Gilbert. That's the man I should talk to. Horace Gilbert. - Come in. Good morning. - Good morning. - Is Mr. Gilbert around? - Yes. Do you have an appointment? - No, but it's important that I talk to him. - Ah, well, Mr... You work here, don't you? - Steve Shepherd from design. - I'm sorry, Mr. Shepherd. He never sees anybody without an appointment. He can probably fit you in sometime next month. - Oh, that's no good. - Hang on a minute. I'll see what I can do. - Thank you. (knocking at door) (operatic singing) - Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gilbert, but there's somebody'd like to see you. - What do you mean someone? Who? - Mr. Shepherd. - Has he got an appointment? - No. - Then get rid of him. - Mr. Gilbert. - What? What's this about? - I have to talk to you. It's very important. - I'm busy. Who are you anyway? - Steve Shepherd. I work for you. - Oh, you do, do you? All right, thank you, Ms. Dudley. - Thanks. - I like to think of my door as always open for my staff. Well... - Yesterday, Bill Cowie fired one of your best architects. Ronnie Osborne. Ronnie's been with the firm for almost 20 years. It's just not right. Cowie is way out of line, Mr. Gilbert. Is there anything you can do about it? Mr. Gilbert? - Do you like opera, Steven. This one's a real heartbreaker. - Anyway, about Mr. Osborne. - I know about Mr. Osborne. Hard worker, not without talent, nice fella. - Then why sack him? All he did was criticize those ugly holiday flats. And he's not the only one who thinks... - Really? And what do you think about them Steven? - Well... - Come, come don't hold back. Say what you really think. - Well, to be honest, I think the project's grotesque. - Grotesque? In what way grotesque? - In every way. I mean, look at it. It's like some giant concrete toilet. - A giant concrete toilet. That's very amusing. So I take it that you don't like it. - It's an abomination. It's tasteless. It's tacky. Whoever designed that ought to be put up against a wall and shot. - You clearly feel strongly about it, Steven. - You bet I do. And if the designer was here, I would tell him to his face. - You're in luck, Steven. He is here. - Here in this building? - In this very room. - You mean? (ominous music) You. - I think it's time for you to leave, Steven. - You're right. I'll get back to work. - I don't think you quite understand, please. When I say leave, I mean leave. As in, leave my employment and never come back. - You're sacking me? - That's right, Steven. I'm sacking you. Shut the door on the way out, would you? - Mr. Gilbert, I only... - Bye, Steven. (somber music) - [Ms. Dudley] How did it go? - Well... - It went well? - Well, he fired me. - Oh no, that's awful. What did you do? - I only told him what I thought. - No, you didn't, did you? - What am I gonna tell Alice? - Your wife? - My daughter. - Well, you just have to tell her the truth. - She'll kill me. - I'm sure she'll understand. - What? - [Steven] It's all right. It's not as bad as it sounds. - You've got no job and we've got no money. - Yeah. Okay. It is as bad as it sounds. - But you'll be able to get another job, won't you? - Not in this town, love. - What do you mean? - You remember the offer we had on this house? Well, it looks now like we'll have to accept that. Sell up, move back to London. - What? - That's where the work is, Alice. - Well, you can't sell the house. - But we've no option. - Dad, this is my home. - It's my home too, sweetheart. I don't want to move. - It's always been my home. You can't take it away from me. - We've no choice. We haven't any money. - I've got 200 pounds in my bank account. Have that. - Oh, that's really sweet of you, Alice, but it's not nearly enough. I've got to do what's best. - Selling the house is best? - It won't be so bad. We'll get a nice little flat. You like that? - I know this place. Every corner of it. - Alice, it's just a house. - It's not just a house. It's all we've got. (sobs) (men murmuring) - Morning, one and all. Thank you. Geoffrey. - Horace. - How are ya? - Well, the council planning committee. We're all dying to see what you've got for us. - Thank you, Geoffrey. Gentlemen, the buzzwords of the '90s are caring and sharing. As you know, I care about this town. No, I love this town. That's why, I want to share it with as many people as possible. (dramatic music) - Voila! Paradise Villas. - Paradise? - It looks like a giant concrete toilet. (bright music) - [Girl] You've got to be joking, this place is such a drag. It's got nothing. - [Alice] It's got my house. - All it's got is rotten tourists who turn up and take over the place every summer. Look at them. It's pathetic. Our place will be crawling with them soon. You ought to try living in a hotel. Then you'd really have something to moan about. - What's so bad about living in a hotel? - "Hannah don't use that bathroom, it's for the guests. Turn that music down, Hannah. The guests don't like it." And all for a rotten 15 quid a night. - 15 quid? A night? Each? - Well, except for kids. They're half price. Oh Alice, will you come on. - It's bound to be good for business. - Now, that is a man with his finger well and truly on the pulse. - But aren't there buildings already on that site? - It's not a problem. I've already bought up most of the properties on the site. There's only one house remaining and that is being dealt with. Gentlemen, I guarantee that everybody in this room will benefit from this project. - Well, thank you Mr. Gilbert. I'm sure we'll get this matter our fullest consideration. - Thank you gentleman. - What did I tell you? It's in the bag. (bright music) - Dad! (clattering) Dad! Dad! - That's terrific. - Are you up here? Dad! - Yeah, thanks. Bye. - [Both] Great news! - Yours first. - I've had this amazing idea. - Okay, let's hear it. - Why don't we start doing bed and breakfast, taking guests 15 pounds a night. Then we'd have loads of money. We could keep the house and still stay here. It's brilliant. Isn't it? Okay. What's your great news? - I've just sold the house. - No. - Sorry. The estate agent said it was the best offer we'd get. Alice? (door slams) (alarm ringing) - Good morning. - [Steve] Huh? - Breakfast is served. - Ouch. - And on the menu today, we have the choice of cereals, fam fresh egg and bacon, fried tomatoes, mushrooms and sausages, lightly grilled toast with delicious homemade thick cut marmalade, lashings of piping hot coffee and a copy of the local paper. - What's this all in aid of? - It's not in aid of anything. It's breakfast. You've got a suspicious mind. You just think I'm after something, don't you? - Sorry Alice, looks lovely. - (exclaims) Look at that! You know my friend, Hannah? Her mum and dad take in paying guests. - Very interesting. - Bed and breakfast 15 pounds a night per person, 15 pounds. And they've got room for six. - Yes Alice. - Six guests at 15 pounds a night is 90 pounds a night. - Can I? - That's 630 pounds a week. How much did you earn, Dad? - I know what you're doing and it won't work. - That's about 2,500 pounds a month. - Alice, forget it. We don't know anything about running a guest house. We have to be able to cook for a start. Okay, ,well you can cook, but well beds. You have to know how to make beds. - Anyone could make beds. - We haven't got a visitor's book. - Dad, we'll be earning 30,000 pounds a year. We can buy one. - 30, 30,000? 30? - Thousand. - What? - Sorry, Mr. Gilbert, I'm only passing on what the estate agent said. - He's changed his mind. He won't sell. Right? We'll soon see about that. Get me my hat and coat. Go on. Quick. - Where are you going? - Where do you think I'm going? I'm gonna visit that awkward cuss. And I'm gonna make him sell his wretched little house. - How will you do that? - Charm, Miss Dudley, charm. (dramatic music) (jazzy music) (sighs) - Hello dear. Are your mommy and daddy at home? - I'll get my dad. He's upstairs. Dad. (unsettling music) Dad. - Yes, how can I... - What on Earth are you doing here? - I'm the one that should be asking you that. This is my house and you're not welcome in it. - Dad! - My boy. Don't you "my boy" me, Gilbert. If you've come to offer me my job back, tough. I don't need it. - All right, I can understand your being peeved but I vote we put all this bad feeling behind us. Now I'm gonna put my cards on the table. I want to buy your house. - What? - Your house. I want to buy it. - What for? - I know what this is all about. You want to knock this place down and build those hideous flats here, don't you? - I'm going to be over generous with you, Shepherd. I'm gonna offer you 10,000 pounds above the asking price. - That is generous. No way. - 20,000. Now don't mess me about, Shepherd. You'd be a fool not to take this offer. - It's not for sale. - Everything is for sale, young lady at the right price. - You heard my daughter. The house isn't for sale. Alice show this gentleman to the door, will you? - You'll be sorry about this, Shepherd. Believe me. (bright music) (thunder rumbling) - Dad, come away from the window. We don't want people to think we're desperate. - We are desperate. What if we're wrong? What if nobody comes? - Dad, don't worry. It'll be brilliant, it'll be great. We'll be rolling in money. - Well we will if somebody shows up. - We've only just put the sign up. Nobody's gonna come tonight. (doorbell rings) (Steve exclaims) (tense music) - [Alice] Dad! - What are you doing? - We've got to make a good impression. - Okay, don't say it. I'll just go throw myself off the pier. Sorry I've muckied up your doorstep. Bye. - Wait. Are you looking for somewhere to stay? - What? - Do you want a room? - [Woman] You take the Mack? - We've got three rooms. All very nice. - Let me get this straight, you're about to let a deadbeat like me into your nice, clean house? - Step this way. - I do believe I've drowned and gone to heaven. Thank you, thank you. (happy music) - Here, let me take your bag. - [Alice] I'll carry this. - Bet you could use a nice hot bath and a cup of tea. - [Alice] I can soon dry this player on the radiator. - Now then, which room would you like? It's up to you, you choose. - Be our guest. - There's a twin. That's nice. Nice and roomy. Or there's the family room. Haven't got a family in here, have you? (chuckles) - The single's the best. Come on this way. It's warm and cozy. Sea view. Like it? - Yeah, yeah it's lovely. - So you want it? I mean you'll take it? - Please? - Yeah. Sure. Great. - [Both] Yes! - Breakfast. I hope you're hungry. - Wow, that's not for me, is it? - That's ducky Ms... What was it, Golden was it? - Yeah, Golden, Billie. - Hmm, Billie, unusual name. - Yeah, it's after Billie Holiday, blues singer. My mom's a big fan. - Ah. - It's great. Thanks. (doorbell rings) - Mr. Shepherd? - Yes. - Dick Bearden from the council. - Oh yes. - We understand that you've commenced trading on these premises as a bed and breakfast or a boarding house facility. - [Steve] That's right. - Without a certificate of inspection I'm afraid. (tisking) - I don't know what you mean. - Now, we'll come in. Oh dear oh dear. Look at this. How many bathrooms have you got? - One. - No, in the whole house. - One. - Only one bathroom. - That ceiling looks a bit low to me. - I've seen enough already. You a guest here madam? - Yeah. - Not anymore I'm afraid. Will you please stop eating that? - What? I'd be obliged if you'd pack your belongings and vacate the premises as soon as possible - The lowest! Hey! - What do you think you're doing? - Closing you down, I'm afraid. And make that B&B sign removed. And I must ask you to cease trading immediately. - Why? - Well, unfortunately this place doesn't measure up to the legal requirements. - Says who? - The public health and safety regulations. - What can I do about that? - Whoo, well you're talking about major operations. For a start, those windows need to replaced. This wall needs to come down. The staircase needs widening. And of course there's the new bathrooms, fire doors. Not to mention that ceiling. - You're talking about 20 or 30,000 pounds. I haven't got that sort of money. - Then you haven't got a hotel. Sorry mate. (tense music) (sad music) - Well, that's it then, isn't it? I mean, what did we think we were playing at, running a hotel? I felt like a total jerk in front of those people. - Why? You weren't to know about all those rules. - Well I should have known about it. That's the whole point. Jumping in without knowing a thing about it. What an idiot. - So, what are we going to do? - Well, we're in a hole for crying out loud. You tell me what to do and I'll do it. No, better still don't tell me. (dish crashes) Oh blast! This flaming door! This blasted house! (growls) - [Billie] Is everything all right? - Sorry 'bout all this. - So what are you gonna do now? - Sell up and move to London I suppose. - Yeah, you're not keen? - You could say that. - So what does your mom think of it at all? - I didn't have a mom. She's dead. - Oh, I'm sorry. - It was three years ago. - That's fair enough. - We manage. - You must miss her, though eh? Must be hard on your dad too? - Yeah, and all this worry about the house doesn't help. - Oh you're not gonna pay attention to those two jumped up pain pushers are ya? - They've got the law behind them and we don't have 20,000 pounds. - So, borrow it. (Steve growls) (banging on door) - Thank you. - Um, I was just saying you should go into balance society. Tell 'em you need the money, they might lend it to ya. - [Alice] What about it, Dad? - No, no, no, no, no, no. That's it. I'm not being talked into any more crazy schemes. Forget it. You know your trouble? You're a defeatest. Give in too easily. - She's right, Dad. We can't just give in. - It's hopeless. - Defeatist. See? - I am not a defeatist. - Well why don't you prove it? - Get your coat on and get down to that building society. You've got the making of a great little business or the go here and if you let it slip through your fingers, you're a schnuk. (playful music) - Who is this girl? And what's a schnuk? - Dad. - Ah, I'm okay. I'm okay. - Just trying- - Alice. - Oh, hi. - Hi, Hannah. - Hello, Mr. Shepherd. - Hello there. You're not at work today? - Uh no I- - My dad got the sack. - Thank you, Alice. - It's not a secret. We're opening up as a B&B, same as you. - Oh really? - Well if I can get a loan to fix up the house. - Well what do you want to do that for? - We don't want to. We have to. - Council regulations. But you must know all about those. - What are you talking about? You surely don't have more than six bed spaces do you? Less than six bed spaces and you don't have to bother with any of that. - Are you sure? 'Course I'm sure. - We haven't got more than six beds. - Well then. - But the man from the Council said we had to widen the staircase and put in extra bathrooms. - Oh, that's nonsense. Somebody's been pulling your leg, Mr. Shepherd. Check it out with the Council if you don't believe me. Come on, Hannah. - See you tomorrow. - I'm sorry. We've got to fly. - Bye. - Yeah, bye. - Odd. Right. Come on. - [Alice] Where are we going? - Town hall. (bright music) - I'm telling you there's nobody called Peyton works here. We've got a Patel. - It was definitely Peyton. A little bloke with a briefcase. - Oh, well that narrows it down. - There were two of them. They tried to shut down our bed and breakfast. - Well somebody's been playing silly beggars if you ask me. - Who would do a thing like that? - Gilbert. He's trying to force us out of business. - What a creep. So we don't have to close down. - Well, no not if your place is up to scratch. - Fantastic! - I'll be around on the 8th to check it out for cleanliness, hygiene, that sort of thing. R4? - Fine. You won't have any complaints. Believe me. - You've saved our lives, Mr. Noakes. - Oh. (chuckles) Goodbye. - Bye. (tense music) (dramatic opera music) (knocking at door) - There's a call for you, Mr. Gilbert. - I thought I told you to hold all calls, Ms. Dudley. - Yes, I know you said that but I thought you'd want to take this one. - You thought? I don't pay you to think. Whoever it is, tell him to go away. - Fine. I'll tell Mr. Everett that then, shall I? - What? Everett. Put him on. Put him on. Geoffrey, all well? They came to the town hall. Blast them. - It's not all bad. The health inspector's going round on Monday to check them out. - Is he now? Wouldn't it be a shame if he found something? Leave it to me, Geoffrey. Much appreciated. I hate pink. Throw it away. - So did you get the money? - No. - Great. Isn't it? Is it? - It was all a big mistake, we found out we don't need it. - Brilliant. So you're back in business? - Yep. - That's a relief. Otherwise I'd be camping down under the pier. - You mean you'll stay another night? - Yeah. - Great. - See you later. - It's going to work, our idea's going to work. And we'll never have to leave. - Well okay. we've got one guest. But we're not exactly over crowded, are we? (doorbell rings) - We're having the most terrible trouble finding somewhere to stay. There's five of us, I'm afraid. - Five. - Welcome. Welcome. - Do you mean it? - Let me take your shark. - So many places just won't take kids. - Oh we love kids. Love 'em. Come on in, folks. (kids cheering) - Thank you. (suspenseful music) - It's Gilbert. - [Shorter Man] Thank you, Professor. - Hello, Mr. Gilbert. - Excuse me. Don't you have a muzzle for this creature? - Sorry, Mr. G. Jeremy, keep your mouth shut. Eat your chips. Now you shoulda seen us as the men from the Council, Mr. G, we were dead convincing. - Yeah, so convincing they went straight down to the town hall to check your credentials. - Yeah? - Yes, eh. - Well that wasn't our fault. We just did what you said. Just give us our money. We'll be off. - No, you get nothing until this matter is concluded. I want those people out of the house. Do you understand. - [Shorter Man] What we supposed to do? - [Mr. Gilbert] Just get in and I'll tell you. - I want more orange juice! - Hey, here we go. Who's first? - Me! I want more orange juice! - Where's mine? - Yeah, just coming. - Can I have a coffee, please? - [Alice] Yes, right. Won't be a second. - Yuck, I'm not eating that! - He doesn't like mushrooms. Can you take it away? Give him another egg instead. No problem. - Where's mine? I want mine. - Do you like mushrooms? - [Little Girl] Yes. - Then you have this. - [Boy] I want my orange juice. - [Mother] Please. - Ugh. - Oh, couldn't you? (yelling) Sugar! - Dad, stop panicking. - Who's panicking? I am not panicking. Ah, where are the eggs? We've run out of eggs. A B&N with no eggs is like a bad joke. - I'll do the eggs, you do the coffee. - Yeah, but what about the kippers? - Kippers are off. Go, go! (children singing unintelligibly) - Right. Who wanted coffee? - Oh I did. - Excuse me, will breakfast be long, the only- - We've gotta get the ferry at 10. - Yeah, won't be long now. * Are we waiting - I hope we're not being any trouble. (chuckles) - You said this would be easy. This is not easy. - You can manage. You'll have to 'cause I'm off to school now. - What? - School. - Well you can't. - What do you mean I can't? I've got to go to school. - Any normal child would jump at the chance of a day off. - I can't go bunking off every time we book guests. You can manage. By the way, the eggs are done. - You look like you're in a bit of a mess. - Wait 'til you see your kippers. - Need a hand? - Nah, he can manage. See you later. - Pay no attention to her. If you've an ounce of compassion in you you'll put this apron on and come and save my bacon, and my eggs and my sausages. - Great. Okay. Get some plates out for these eggs. (jazzy music) And lose some of that rubbish real quick. - [Guest] 51, 52 pounds and 50 pence. - Wow, does seem like a lot, doesn't it? But that's what it costs I guess. So do come again. - Come on you lot. - Bye. - We've only got 10 minutes. Come on move it. - My thanks. - Have a happy holiday. - See you, thank you. Cheers. - Oh yeah. - I still never got my orange juice. - Here, have a refund. Hello! You left one behind. - Oh Wayne, come on. - Come on. - [Wayne] What's the idea leaving me behind? - Oh, you can come again. You're on. So can I stay one more night? - Please. Please do. - Right, okay. Better be off then. See you later. - Yeah, see ya. Oh Billie, thanks. Hungry. (mournful jazzy saxophone music) (knocking at door) - Sorry to bother you. I was wondering, do you have a room? - What? - If you're full up I can try somewhere else. No trouble. Sorry, I wondered do you? - Hang on. - Sorry, I'm disturbing you. Are you looking for a room? - Well, if it's not too much trouble, I'd hate to put you out or anything. No, no, no bother. Come in, come in. It's 15 pounds a night. - I was having to stay for a week if that's okay. Oh, that's more, that's wonderful. Great. Have you any luggage? - No. Well, yes. Well, no sort of. - I'll give you a hand. - No, no, no, no. I'll, I'll get it. If that's all right with you, I mean. I hate to be a nuisance. - Whatever suits you. I'll show you the room. It's in here, Mr... - Berry. - Mr. Berry, it's a nice room. You can see the sea. - [Mr. Berry] I'm sure it'll be fine. - I'll just show you that... - I'll manage and that's fine. - I'll pay now if that's all right with you. That's all right with me. I like to settle my bills in advance. If it's no bother. The clean towels are in the wardrobe, left- (door slams) (jazzy music) - Hi. - Alice, you are a genius. - Tell that to my teacher. - Aw, you had a bad day? - Something like that. - Well, I've had a wonderful day. Look. 52 pounds plus 105. - More guests? - Well one, but he's staying a whole week. It's working, Alice. - Of course it's working. - What about you know who? - Billie? Well she's staying another night too. - Don't forget to ask about the money, will you? - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. What do you think she's gonna run off without paying? She's a nice kid, Alice, believe me, she'll pay. (jazzy music) Sorry for the delay folks. We're getting there. Now, you're the kipper, right? - [Mr. Berry] Excuse me. I'm the kipper. Sorry. - Right, right, right. Course. - Oh lovely. - I'm the full English breakfast. - Thanks. - Well, did you ask her? - I'll ask her after breakfast. - Dad, she's been here six nights. I mean, I like her. But every morning all she says is just one more night. - Come on Alice. - What if she hasn't any money? - I'll ask her after breakfast. Look, I'm really sorry Billie. But for some reason, my daughter's got it into her head that you're broke and you can't pay. (laughing) - What? - I'm broke and I can't pay the bill. I'm really sorry. Don't know what to say. - Aw Billie. It's 90 pounds. - Yeah I know, I know. I'll pay it, I will. I'll get a job. Play me heart out like a flaming mashugana since I got here trying to get some money together. Look, I know I've got to pay you back somehow, right? - Well how? - Why don't you let me, work for you? - What? - That's it! You know that I'm good at it plus you can't cook on your own. - I can. - Then why's that milk boiling over? - Oh! - Whoops. So, how 'bout it then? - When can you start? - Come on Mr. Berry, I want to change your sheets. Mr. Berry. - I don't want my sheets changed. I'm happy with the ones I've got. - Look, I'm only doing my job. Just let us in, eh? - Go away. I'm busy. Leave me alone. - Weird. - Now what's he up to? - Won't let me in to change the sheets. (Steve sighs) - Come on Mr. Berry. - I'm in the middle of something. Can't you come back later? - All right, Mr. Berry. Is everything all right in there? Yes thank you, fine, thank you. Yes. Goodbye. - This place has got to be spotless before the health inspector arrives. Otherwise... - We're in deep schtuck? - Exactly. (ominous tones) (jazzy music) (doorbell rings) - Oh, I don't believe it. He's early. - Steve, relax. The house is spotless. If we scrub it anymore, it'll bleed, - Calm. Calm. Mr. Noakes. - Afternoon. - Come on in. Can we get you anything, a tea or coffee or? - No thanks. I can't stay long. I've got a restaurant to shut down at five. I'd like to start in the kitchen if I may? - Sure, it's right through there. And you'll be pleasantly surprised. (tense music) Billie! - May I? - No. I mean, you haven't seen the airing cupboard. (mutters) and everything, it's amazing. It's just up here. - Billie! - Let's do this methodically, shall we? - Mr. Noakes I really think you should see the lichen on that boiler. - Billie! Thank you. Right. Kitchen. - Kitchen. - Hi. - Hi. - Oh hello Mr. Noakes. - Hello. - Well, do we pass? - Ah well, I don't know. So far I've only seen the hall and as halls go, it's a very nice hall. - Did you offer Noakes some tea, Dad? (tense music) - Alice! - I was just saying that we should show Mr. Noakes the airing cupboard. You know the brown linen cupboard upstairs? Yeah, yeah? - Great idea. This way Mr. Rats, Mr. Noakes. - I want to inspect the flaming kitchen. He wants to inspect the flaming kitchen. Follow me, Mr. Noakes. Come and see our airing cupboard. - It's good, isn't it? - Ah, it's wonderful. And even better than the hall. - Feel how warm that is. - Yeah, very warm. - Do you have an airing cupboard at home, Mr. Noakes? - What is all this stuff about airing cupboards? - Why is everyone looking in the airing cupboard? - [Billie] Where did they come from? - More to the point, how do we get rid of them? - Don't look at me. I'm not getting any of them. - Dad's fishing net! Wait here. (tense music) - Why don't you all go and clean the garden? Go on, move, go on, go on. (screaming) - What was that? - Sounded like a scream. - Oh there's a big black one out there! Oh no, there's one just going out into the hall. - Shouldn't you got to have a look, Mr. Shepherd? - Why don't you Mr. Berry? - Oh! - Now what? - Oh! - [Mr. Berry] Where's she got to? - I've had a belly full of this. I want to see your kitchen and I'm going to see your kitchen. - Got you! - Oi, what are you doing with my hat? - Well, it's an old Scottish Jewish custom, you see? Whenever a stranger arrives on your doorstep to make them feel more welcome you do a wee dance around the hat. See? (singing in foreign language) - Oh for pity's sake. Will you please get out of my way and let me into that kitchen? - No. - Okay. Okay. What's the point? Let the man in. - Thank you very much. (suspenseful music) (cat meows) Oh hello. Oh what a lovely creature. Aren't you beautiful, eh? Aren't you lovely, eh? Meow, meow, meow. - I never knew you had a cat. - Neither did I. - Cleopatra, there you are! Oh, I'm so sorry. This is all my fault. You mustn't blame Mr. Shepherd. He had no idea I was hiding Cleopatra in my room. I couldn't come on holiday and leave her behind. I just couldn't. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - [Mr. Noakes] So that's what you were hiding from me is it? Oh I'm not worried about cats, daft man. Now can I please get on with my work? (suspenseful music) - [Steve] Is that it, Mr. Noakes? Is everything okay? - Yes, very nice establishment you've got here. - That's a relief. Thank you. - What happened to my hat? (Billie gasps) What? - I think I put it over there. Okay. Here's your hat. - Right. Well, I'll be off then. - Bye bye. (thoughtful music) - Yes! (Billie exclaims) (tense music) - What? They've granted their license. - But what about the rats? Oh, that was hound-fisted bungling boobies. Can't they do anything properly? I know Geoffrey. Yes, Geoffrey. Of course, Geoffrey. Goodbye, Geoffrey. (tense music) Don't get too cocky, Mr. Shepherd. I haven't finished with you yet. In fact, I've barely begun. I'll get you one way or another. - This is your table. On the left here. - Thank you. - Can you manage? This young lady'll take your order. Alice, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. This bed and breakfast idea is really taking off. - Yeah, nothing's gonna stop us now. (dramatic opera singing) (phone buzzes) - What is it now, woman? I thought I told you to hold all calls? - I know you said that- - Shut up. What are you, stupid or what? - There's no need to be rude, Mr. Gilbert. - Wrong again, Ms. Dudley. Go away. - And the call from Mr. Krauss in Germany? - Tell him to take a flying. - Fine. - Krauss? - Yes. - Why didn't you tell me? Put him on. Go on. Put him on quickly. - [Ms. Dudley] You're through. - Gunther, how are you? Nice of you to call. And how's that charming lady wife? There's no need to lose your rag, old man. The project is steaming ahead. Problems? (chuckles) No problems. - Finished? - Yeah. Is that the lot? - Yep. Well, so that's it then, eh? - What about those? Do you want me to wash them? - No, no, no, no, no. You've done more than enough. - Oh hey, I don't mind. Gimme them, gimme them. - Billie. Billie! - No no, honestly. - You've paid your debt. Now take it easy, eh? Fact, you're free to go anytime you like. - Oh, right. - Bet you'll be glad to be back on the road. - Yeah, great. - What's up? - Nothing nothing. I'll just go pack my stuff. - [Steve] What are you doing here? - You're so thick sometimes, Dad. Can't you see? She doesn't want to leave. - What do you mean? - She likes it here. She likes us. She wants to stay. - You're not seriously suggesting I should say to her, "Billie, how'd you like to come and work for us full time?" - I accept. - Hmm? - Thanks for your kind offer. When do I start? Now? Right, gimme those sheets. - Hello, it's Horace Gilbert. I have a little job for you. Something right up your street. - [Alice] So where did you go next? - After Liverpool, let me think. Spend one horrible day in Sheffield. Then after that Lester, stayed with some people there for a few weeks, didn't work. Story of my life. - What made you leave Glasgow in the first place? - Ever come across the words bored and miserable and aggressive? - I thought Glasgow was supposed to be a nice town. - It is, I was describing my dad. - You didn't get on eh? - I love my mom. She's great. But him? (speaking in foreign language) - What does that mean? - It means a stupid old... It means he treated me like a kid. - I know the feeling. - Yeah, the difference is you are a kid. He wouldn't let me come in after 10 o'clock at night. Can you believe that? Hate the way I dressed, hated my friends. From the minute I was born, it was nag, nag, nag. I just had to get away. - Well, I'm glad you turned up on our doorstep. 'Cause my dad's just hopeless and if... - Billie! - Look at that. Made in heaven. Wonder how much it is. - Come on. Let's go in and ask. - We've got to get back. - Two minutes. Come on, come on. Oh baby you are beautiful. (man exclaims) Oh, sorry. I was just wondering how much you're asking for this, pal? The Norton Commando is surely a little beyond the madam's range. - I don't think there's any call for that, do you? Listen, friend, one of these days I'm gonna have a bike just like that and see when I do it, I'm gonna come roaring in here and use your coat as a garage, right? Come on Alice, let's go. (jazzy music) (doorbell rings) - Hello. - Oh hi. - Do you have any vacancies? - For one, is it? - Please. Sure, come on in. Let me take that. (both exclaiming) I'm so sorry. - [Woman] All my fault. - Are you all right? Here, let me look. - I'm fine. It's fine. Do you welcome all your guests like this? Or am I just lucky? - Yeah. So was it just the one night? - Well, I was hoping I can stay a little bit longer. That's not a problem, is it? - No, no, no. Not at all. It's 15 pounds a night. - Fine. - Grab a seat. So? - It's Maria. - Maria. - Szczebanska. - Sh... (laughs) Stib? - S C Z E-B-A N-S-K-A. - Oh yes, I thought so. So you're not a local girl, then? - No I'm Polish, but I've lived in London for the last 15 years. - But you're just staying here on holiday? - Mm hmm. - All alone? - I wanted to get away from everybody and everything. - Hi. - Oh! Maria, this is my daughter, Alice. And Billie. - Hello. Nice to meet you. And what a lovely necklace. It is silver, isn't it? - Great. So...Well... Oh, uh. Okay. - Let me show you the, after you. (pensive music) (knocking at door) I thought you might like a little supper. - You're so sweet. Thank you. - Only don't tell the other guests, eh? This is for very special visitors only. - I'm very grateful, Mr. Shepherd. - Oh Steve. - Steve, thank you. - Bye. You off out? It's a bit late. - Yeah I'm traveling with the band down at Blue Note Club. - The Blue Note Club? - Yeah, see ya. - Billie, what yourself down there. It's got a bit of a reputation. That place. - I'll be fine. - Well, when will be home? - I don't know, midnight, maybe a bit later. - How'll you get back? - I'll walk, gimme a break, Stevie. - Well I don't like to think of you walking the streets on your own. - So don't think about it. Goodbye. (jazzy music) - [Man] Get off. - Don't come back, you tour rat. - [Groupie] I'm going. - [Billie] Come on, get off me, please. - Billie! Billie! - Hold on. What are you doing here? - I just thought I'd come and walk you home. - Walk me home? (friends snickering) - You're gonna be warm enough like that? - I'm fine. You shouldn't have come. - I'd only have sat around at home worrying about you. - 'Night! - [Friends] See you later. - 'Kay, see you, bye. Steve, I know you mean well, but let's get one thing straight right away. I may be living at your house, but you're not, I repeat, not my flaming dad, get it? - I was only thinking of you and you're - I was just doing...I'm a grown woman. I can look after myself, right? - Billie! Billie! - You see what that was? I think Mr. Gilbert will be very pleased to hear about this. What do you say Jazzer? - Yeah. (phone buzzes) - [Ms. Dudley] There's two gentlemen to see you, Mr. Gilbert. - I'm not in. - Hello, Mr. Gilbert. It's us. - For crying out loud. - I'm sorry, Mr. Gilbert. - So am I. Thank you, Ms. Dudley. All right. All right. I told you never to come in. Now what on Earth are you playing at? - We've got some information for you. - Juicy stuff. - Stuff that'll make your mouth water. - Can't you get it through your thick skulls I cannot be seen fraternizing with you riff raff. Now out! Come on, out. - Oh so you don't want to know about Shepherd and the house? Okay, let's go, Jeremy. Shepherd, Shepherd, now tell me, tell me. - Aha! - Now don't "ah ah" me. What do you mean? - We haven't be paid for the last two jobs. - So if you want the info, mate, you'll have to cough up. - Now wait a minute. This info, will it help me get the house? - Could do. - All right. Shall we say 200 pounds? - Sure, if we say it twice. - All right, 400, but it better be good. Now spit it out. - Shepherd's gotten a Scottish bird working for him. - Lippy little number. - And we happen to know that not all the old chicks is is happy in the old hen house. - Oh come on, get to the point. - You could say the feathers have been flying. - They're at each other's throats. Now's your chance to steam in there, do the business. - United they stand, divided they fall. - Exactly. The girl's ready for nobbling. Know what I'm saying? - Yes. Absolute garbage. Do you seriously imagine that that information is worth 400 pounds? Go on. Get out. - Hey what. - What about? - I said get out. Now move it! And you, out! (tense music) - [Alice] I've got to go to school now. - Oh, all right love. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - See ya. - Nice kid, I like her. - Fetch Maria some fresh coffee, will you? - Coming. - So what's on the cards today? Going somewhere nice? - Got any ideas? - Well, now there's a question. Depends. Are you a stick of rock into the pier, bumper cars and candy floss sort of a person or a healthy walks along the cliff tops discovering historic sites and homemade scones in the little old lady's tea shop, kind of a girl? - I'd say I was more can't decide what to do or where to go sort of person who would so with someone nice to show her the local attractions. - Can I apply for the job? - You got it. - Right, hold out your cup. Oh no, sorry. I don't really want it. - We're off. Hold the fort, will you? - Now wait a minute, what the- - You can manage can't you? Shall we? (thoughtful music) (tense music) (rock music) - Hello. (Billie exclaims) - Don't do that. - Sorry. - If you're looking for a room I'm afraid we're full, okay? - Are you Ms. Golden? - Yeah. - Well my name is Horace Gilbert. Perhaps you've heard of me. - Horace Gilbert? The Horace Gilbert? You've got cheek coming in here, haven't ya? Mr. Shepherd's not in. - I know. It's you I wanted to talk to me. But do you mind? - Me? So what'd you want with me? - You're a clever girl. Let's talk turkey shall we? Now I want this house, but I can't get it, can I while your Mr. Shepherd is busy playing at hotel? - What has this got to do with me, Mr. Gilbert? - I know that you are keen on having one of these. - No, I've already got a brochure like that, thanks. - Ha ha, very funny. I mean, of course the bike. - Are you trying to bribe me or something? - Well obviously. Listen, I want that man put out of business. And I think you're the person to do it. When the house is mine, the bike is yours. Now I've come up with a very clever ruse which won't harm a soul. And it's very clever and simple and effective. Yes? Now what if somebody were to leave the plug in the bath carelessly and then accidentally forgot to turn the taps off? You see water does the most dreadful damage to a building seeping through the floorboards. Very nasty. Hotel shuts, Mr. Shepherd goes bust, but I offer him a fair price for what's left of his building. You get your bike, I'm happy, he's happy, you're happy, tra-la-la, everybody's happy. Oops. - I think you'd better go, Mr. Gilbert. - I think it's worth considering. - Goodbye, Mr. Gilbert. - Bye. (ominous tones) (jazzy music) - [Alice] Billie, phone. It's someone called Trucker. - Right. Hiya, how you doing? Who told you it was my birthday? No, no, it's not 'til tomorrow. - After you, Ms. Giovan. - Thank you kindly, Mr. Shepherd. - Where have you been? - Oh, we had the most wonderful day. Your dad's such fun. We went for this lovely long walk on the sea front all the way down to the light house. Then lunch at this lovely little pub and then what? Oh yes, Steve insisted he had a donkey ride. It was so funny. And look, what he won at the fair! - You were going to meet me after school. We were supposed to be doing the shopping. - Oh shoot, I completely forgot. I'm sorry. Look, I'm going upstairs to my room. Thanks again. (Billie laughs) - Right. Shopping. - [Billie] Okay so I'll see you down at pub about 11. - She's not going down to that club again, is she? - It's her birthday, lay off her. Now can we please go? (tense music) - No, the old boy won't be showing up to walk me home 'cause if he does I'm through with this place. * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday dear Billie * Happy birthday to you (cheering) - Shut up you lot, you. - Where to now then, people? - [Group] Party, party, party, party. - Party, your place. - No, no, come on. - Come on, party. - Yeah. - Whoo hoo hoo! - Shh. (giggling) Through here. (squealing) (group whispering) Shh, shh. Guys, guys. You gotta keep it quiet, eh? - Where's the food? - I'm starving is there any toast? - Shh! Stick the kettle on. You can make a cup of tea, that's all. That's the breakfast stuff. Put it back. Get off. (rock music) (squealing) - Yay! - What in heaven's name's going on down here? Billie, who are all these people? It's 2:30 in the morning for crying out loud. - Nothing, is there a problem? - You're darn right there's a problem. This is my house. - Calm yourself, mate. It's the girl's birthday, we're celebrating. - [Woman] We're having a party. (group laughs) - This is outrageous. You've gone too far. Look, I've got a whole house full of guests trying to sleep up there. Out, all of you, out the back. Come on, out! I mean it, out now, all of you. (group snickering) Let's go! (growls) Out! Look you lot, I'm not gonna tell you again. - All right. - That's it, out. Come on, out, I mean it. All of you. Now. - What's happening? - [Billie] Sorry guys. I'll see you tomorrow maybe. - Right. - Oh Dad, no. - Up to bed, please. Now. - But Dad! - Alice! - [Billie] Thanks a lot, pal. - Will you keep your voice down? - You just made me your kid, bumbling in front of my friends. How dare you? - How dare I? That's rich. I'll thank you to remember this is my house. - Well, I live here too. - Yeah, for the time being. - Meaning? - Look, I've got a nine year daughter upstairs. I won't have this sort of thing happening in my house. - What sort of thing? We were making toast. - I don't know what to make of you. I mean, I go out of my way to help you. And this is how you pay me back. - Well, if you'd stop treating me a flaming kid. Then stop behaving like one. - We were just having a laugh. - Fine, but not in my house and not at three o'clock in the morning. And if you're not happy about that then you know what you can do. - Yeah, I know what I can do. (tense music) (happy music) (sobbing) (tense music) (thoughtful music) (gasps) - What's happening? - Erm, I don't know. - Are you leaving? - Well, I was thinking... No. - Billie, I'm sorry. I flew off the handle. - I'm sorry too, Steve. - You all right? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - Look Billie, I do know you're not a kid and I'm not gonna keep on at you as if I was your dad. I promise. - Thanks. And I promise that I'll be more considerate from now on. - Friends? Your turn to serve the kids on table three. - You've totally ruined my birthday. - Ah, any old excuse. Goodnight, Ms. Golden. - Goodnight, Mr. Shepherd. (thoughtful music) - [Jeremy] How long have we gotta sit here? - [Thug] Long as it takes. - But I'm missing "Master Chef" 'cause of this. - Shut up complaining will ya? Look, we're not budging from here. Until we've dug some dirt on Shepherd, all right? - Want some pot noodle? - [Thug] You great big pudding. What do you think this is, Meals on Wheels? Now, can we please just watch? - [Alice] It is them. It's those two men who work for Gilbert. - You're right. - Flaming cheek. - Gilbert must be really desperate to have us watched 24 hours a day. - Yeah, I mean do they really think nobody's gonna notice them? - There must be something we can do. Ah, (giggles) I've got it. (snoring) (horn blaring) (exclaiming) - You stupid, idle wassock. You fell asleep, didn't ya? I told you to stay on guard. - I actually never heard that. Vivaldi, it always sends me right off. (laughing) - Just get on, go on. - Dick, Dick, what is it? Oh, lovely balloon. - [Dick] Get in, ya big lunk. Get in! - Did you see that? - What was all that about? - Oh we were just seeing the happy couple off on their honeymoon. - How about this happy couple? Are we still on for today? - You betcha. - Any chance for breakfast before we go? I know I'm late but- - For you, we make it a special exception. - You are sweet. - Oh Billie, clear the tables would ya? Alice, one full English breakfast, please. Allow me to show you the best seat in the house. Come. (Steve humming) Maria likes her eggs lightly done. - Does she? (humming) Oh, try and get her a nice piece of bacon. One with not too much fat on it. - Naturally. - What's up with you? What is it? What? Ah, it's Maria. - It's you. - What's me? What do you mean it's me? Is it because I wasn't there yesterday to pick you up from Hannah's house? - Yes and because you weren't there to go shopping the day before that. And you weren't there to collect me from school. And today, the day we usually go swimming together, guess what? You won't be here again. - Ah. - What's going, Dad? - What can I tell you? I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I can't have you spend the afternoon on your own. You can come with us. - Are you serious? - Yeah, we'll have a great time. Me and my two favorite girls, eh? Alice? Once upon a time it was mom and me who were your two favorite girls. - Ah. - How can you just forget her? - Alice. I...I will never forget your mom. How could I, how could you think that? - She'd be sick if you saw the way you behave with that woman. - Yeah. Come and sit down. Please? (thoughtful music) Darling, I know you miss Mom. I miss her too. Every day I look around this place and I can see her, I still love her. And that won't change even though she's not here, but life's got to go on. - But Dad. - Let me finish. Mom loved me. And I know she wouldn't have wanted to see me lonely. - How can you be lonely? I'm here. - I know that, baby. And I love you very much. But surely you must have realized that one of these days I'd meet somebody new, didn't you? - Yes. But does it have to be her? - What does that mean? - Nothing. - No, come on, out with it. - All right. I don't like her and I don't trust her. - Is that a fact? Well, listen to me. I happen to like her very much. And if you've got a problem with that, well, I'm sorry, because that's the way it is. Okay? (sad music) - Tea? - Nah. - Okay, what's wrong with you? - Nothing. - That's a nice picture. - That was the summer my dad put up the swing. It was so funny. He was mucking around, showing off so much. The branch broke and he landed right on his bum. (both laughing) My mom and me just fell about laughing. We laughed and we laughed. - Don't be too hard on your dad, Alice. - I don't know what to do. - Come here. - Alice! You ready? Get your swimming stuff, we're off. - Go on. - Now listen, before you set off, give me a minute. Into the kitchen while I speak to her. - Okay. - Hi. - Where's Dad. - Alice, look, I wanted a quick word. I know the situation is difficult, but the last thing in the world I want is to come between you and your dad. Honest. He told me what you were saying this morning and I felt really hurt. So I said we'll come home early and Alice can go for her swim. Right? Friends? - All well? - Everything's going to be just fine. Yes, Alice? - Come on. We'd better get a move on. Have a lovely time. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. (sighs) - Pretty kid. - [Billie] It's difficult. - All right. All right. 15 minutes. Yes. Okay. Look, I cannot talk now. Right? See you soon. Oh hi. I thought you were out. Wrong number. Right, I'm going to get some fresh air. Bye. - Bye. (happy music) (both laughing) - Try, come on. Let's do some proper swimming before we finish, okay? What you need to do. Like so. Come on and kick your legs. All right. Last one home's a stinker. I can't get my keys out. Hey! Wait! - Hello. - Oh hi, Ms. Dudley. - Carol. Is the water warm? - Yeah, no, it's great. Not too busy either. - Oh great, well can't wait. See you then. - [Steve] Yeah, bye. (unsettling music) - There goes your friend. - Hmm? What? - It was Maria. She's gone now. - Hi. - Hiya. Had a good swim? - Great. Where's Maria? - She went out. - See, I told you I saw her. - Swims like a torpedo, x-ray vision. Next thing you know she'd be joining the legion of superheroes. And who better to fly at the speed of light to the nether reaches of the kitchen and to do battle with the one they call Darjeeling. - You mean you want a cup of tea? - Yes, Earthling. - It's the chlorine fumes gone to his head. - Hi. - Oh you're back. You're just in time for a cuppa. - Oh great. Thanks. - I needed some air, went for this lovely long walk along the cliffs. - The cliffs? - Oh, the view is just great from up there. Do you know you can see France. Amazing. - So you weren't in town, then? - Oh no. Oh, by the way, Steve, could you spare me a moment? There's something I wanted to... - Sure. - Great. - That woman's a liar. I did see her in town. - Yeah and I heard her making a date with someone on the phone. Told me it was a wrong number. - What's going on? - There's no facing it. She's two timing your dad, - Seeing someone else? - Gotta be. - Well I'm telling- - Hey, she'll just deny it won't she? We've gotta find some proof. (mystical music) We can't go searching through other people's bags. - No, definitely not. - Have you given any more thought about what I was saying the other day? Only I need an answer before I go to London. - I have, actually. To tell the truth. I haven't been thinking about much else. - Oh, you're wasted down here, Steve. There are firms in London crying out for good architects. I really don't know why you wouldn't give it a shot. - You know why. It's this house and Alice. - Alice can have the most wonderful life in London. She'd love it. - Maria, I know that, but she doesn't want to leave. This house is special to her. - It's only bricks and mortar, Steve. Our feelings aren't going to suddenly go away, are they? - I'm sure you're right. And it's all great in theory, but I can't afford to move to London. - Yes you can. Tell me how. You can come and stay at my place. Come on. Say something. - Do you mean it? Of course you mean it. Well there's an offer. I don't know what to say. - It's simple, just say yes. Sell the house and say yes. (thoughtful music) - What are we looking for? - I don't know, something, anything. Aha! - What's that? - It's a phone number, a local phone number. - She said she didn't know anyone round here. - Well she obviously does, look. His name's Len. - Len, I bet that's who she went to meet in town. - Yeah, she seeing this bloke, Len and she's stringing your dad along the whole time. - Wait, what if we're wrong. I mean, what if this Len turns out to be her brother or something? - Well why would she lie? Twice. - Right, that's it. - Alice? - Dad. I need to talk to you. - Go ahead. - Alone. - You can talk in front of Maria. - Look, you've got to listen to me. This woman's a phony. - Hmm? - She's lying to you. She wasn't out walking in the cliffs. She was in town meeting a man. - What? - Hasn't she told you about her other boyfriend? - Alice! - This is nonsense. I don't know what you're talking about. - Of course she doesn't. So who's Len then? Ask her that. - I don't know any Len. - It's true, Dad, if you don't believe me, look at this. - You've been in my bag! - Alice. - She's making a fool of you, dad. - Alice, stop this now. What's she on about? - Oh, for heaven's sake. There's a simple explanation to all this. - We're dying to hear it. - Read what it says. Go on, read it. - Lens, 0424423399. - Lens as in a contact lens. That's the number of the opticians in the high street. - What? - Your dad recommended him to me when I lost one of my lenses yesterday. - That's right. I did. That's where I was this afternoon. I know this is silly, but I hate people to know I wear contacts. - How dare you go through somebody else's belongings. And what a thing to suggest, I can't believe it. - No don't, it's not important. - No, I happen to think it's extremely important. If we're gonna live together in London, we've got to cut out all this stupid nonsense. - What do you mean live together? - Alice, I've made a decision. Maria and I have discussed it. We're gonna sell the house and move to London. - You, you can't! - My mind's made up. It's all settled. I don't want to hear another word about it. (tense music) - [Woman] Oh, this is such a lovely place you've got here, isn't it, dear? - OH very nice. - We'll definitely be back here yet again next year. - Well, you'll be sitting in the middle of a building site. If you do. - What? - They're knocking down this lovely old house just to build, what was it you called it, a giant concrete toilet? - Is that right, what she said? - Well I'm sure it won't be as bad as they all think. It's only a few little holiday flats. - 600. - Sounds horrible. - But that'll spoil the whole area, won't it? - Is there nothing you can do to stop it? - Well, we did what we could. But we could only hold out for so long Maria, taxi's here. I wish you'd let me come with you to the station. - What, all that standing on the platform and people everywhere? No, let's say our goodbyes here. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. (sad music) And the house sale? - I'll go around the estate agent right after breakfast. - Wonderful. I can't believe this has all happened so quickly. - I'll phone you tonight. The meter's running. Bye. (determined music) - I hope you know what you're doing. - I do, Billie. Oh sugar! Look what she's forgotten. I won't be long. (determined music) - That's it then, isn't it? - Yep, that's it. Who'd have him? - So what are you going to do? - Pack up my stuff and hit the road I suppose. - Need anyone to carry your rucksack? - [Announcer] British Rail apologizes to passengers on platform one for the late arrival of the 10:45 service to London, Victoria. This train will be arriving in four minute's time. (happy music) (Maria laughs) - Hey, guess who you forgot? - I don't believe it. - Oh no. (tense music) - You stupid fool. - You work for Gilbert? - A job's a job. (sad music) - Oh morning, Mr. Gilbert. I'm glad you're here. This needs signing and sending off right- Mr. Gilbert. (phone rings) Gilbert Developments. Yes, one moment. He's just come in. (phone buzzes) - What? - [Ms. Dudley] It's Gunther Krauss from Hamburg. - Oh why can't he leave me in peace? Why can't everybody just leave me in peace? Put him on. Gunther, how are you? Yes Gunther, I know. Yes, but Gunther, listen, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Trust me. I'm on top of the situation. One way or another, we start building by the end of the month. - Could I just quickly ask you to sign this, Mr. Gilbert? - I don't believe this. I'm on the phone to Germany. - Yes, but you particularly wanted- - Shut up and get out you stupid kretin. (laughs) Not you, Gunther. No, yes, there will be no more problems with that wretched house. Not after tonight. I've been pussyfooting about for too long. No more Mr. Nice Guy. It's time we show these people what they're really up against. (unsettling music) (jazzy music) - Where is he? - What? - Something's happened. He hasn't shown his face all day. I think you should go up and have a word with him. But Alice, go easy on him, eh? - Dad? What's up, Dad? - You were right about Maria. She was a phony. She was working for Gilbert. - What? - And I feel for it because I'm an idiot. - No you're not, Dad. - And I thought I'd met somebody who really liked me. And all the time she must've been laughing at me behind my back. - Don't Dad, forget her. - What about you? What can I say to you? - You don't have to say anything. - I'm sorry, Alice. - Dad, these things happen. - Maybe. But why do they always seem to happen to me? Oh, we'll get by, baby, somehow. - 'Course we will. - I mean surely Gilbert's going to give up after all this. What else can he possibly do to us? - Murder? - Shh, shh, keep your voice down will you? I'm not proposing murder, you morons. All I'm asking you to do is to burn down the house. That's all. - But it's full of people. - Details, details, and they'll get out. Stop worrying. Here's some petrol. - No, no, no, no, no, no. It's not on me. Come on Jer. - Stop right here. The money, here, take it. Take it, all of it. There's some for you and you. And there's more where this came from. Just do this one last thing. You know something, Mr. Gilbert, I've suddenly realized something about you. You're not a very nice person. and headcase, mate. There's places for people like you. Here. Stuff your flaming money. Come on, Jeremy. - Right, I'll do it myself. (tense music) (glass breaking) (phone bell rings) (laughing) (flames roaring) (Gilbert gasps) (Gilbert coughs) (fire alarm beeps) - There's a fire! - I know, I'll wake everyone. Mr. And Mrs. Ellis, wake up! There's a fire! - [Steve] You! - [Mr. Gilbert] Get out of my way! (head thuds) - Hello? - Gilbert! Billie! - It's okay, Alice. - [Gilbert] Get out of my way. (Gilbert exclaims) Careful. Careful please. - Alice, Alice where's your dad? - I thought he was with you. - [Billie] Steve! (coughing) Alice! Alice! - [Alice] Help me. Quick, come on, Dad. - [Billie] Hurry, come on. (siren wailing) (radio transmissions garbling) - [Officer] Back, clear everyone. Back now. Clear the door. Any casualties? (sobbing) (sizzling) - Ah, mind my ankles. - [Officer] Go on sir. - See you in 10 years, Gilbert. - Inspector, there's a simple explanation for all of this. - Just get in the car, sir. (Gilbert exclaims) - I don't get it. Who called the police? - Yeah, and the fire brigade. - I did. - Carol! - Ms. Dudley? - You just went too far this time, Mr. Gilbert. - Ms. Dudley you're fired. - Too late, Mr. Gilbert, I resign. (happy music) - Thanks Carol. Well folks, that's Gilbert off our back. - And nothing's gonna stop us now. Right? - Right. (group laughing) (bright music)
