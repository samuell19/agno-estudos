Said Daddy was no good... just a pusher for the King Lords gang. - Hey, baby. - You seen my wallet? - Yeah, I put it on the dresser. - I can't find it. Well, I know it's there, baby. I put it there. - Good morning. - Good morning. She swore raising the dead was more likely than Mama and Daddy making it. Mama... They stay proving her and everybody else wrong. And in large part, that means making sure that we don't make the same mistakes. You know what? Why don't you just sit your cute butt down and let me do what I do. Okay? Oh, really? You gonna let me do what I do? Ain't they too old for that? Boy... - Good morning, y'all. - Good morning. Their cuteness can be extra, but they're adorable. I love you. I love you. I can't even lie. They're my OTP. One true pairing. Mama and Daddy were born in Garden Heights. Their first kiss was in the Haven Acres Projects. Daddy says our life is here. 'Cause our people are here. We got Mr. Reuben's barbecue... ...Mr. Lewis's barbershop... ...a Walmart 32 minutes away... and Daddy's store. Carter's Grocery is where you get your milk, Newport shorts, Hot Cheetos, hot gossip, and anything else that you might need in a hurry. Mama thinks Daddy is scared of change. She left the Garden when she was a little girl. And she wants us to get out too. Either way, you gotta stay ready. 'Cause Garden Heights is always gonna be ready for you. Seven? Now, are you staying at your mama's house or with us tonight? At Mama's. As long as King ain't there. And then there's King. He runs the King Lords. My dad used to be his right-hand man. The high school is where you go... ...to get jumped, high, pregnant, or killed. We don't go there. Not since what happened to my friend Natasha. So Mama sent us to another school where everyone's college-bound. - Sekani? - Yeah? Baby, remind me what your name means again. Joy! Yes! So that means I want you to be just as big a joy at school as you are at home, okay? Okay! But less loud! Why you yelling? You guys have a good day. - Love you, Mommy! - I love you too, Sekani. Garden Heights is one world. Williamson is another. And I gotta keep it separate. So when I'm here, I'm Starr Version Two. - See you later, bro. - Peace out. That means flipping a switch in my brain. Williamson Starr doesn't use slang. If a rapper would say it, she doesn't. Even if her white friends do. Hey, boo. - Hey, how are you? - I'm good, girl. Slang makes them cool. Slang makes me "hood." Yo! Those kicks are lit! Thanks. Space Jams. Williamson Starr is approachable. No stank eyes or yelling because Williamson Starr is non-confrontational. Basically, Williamson Starr doesn't give anyone a reason to call her ghetto. And I hate myself for doing it. Let me at him. I'll kick his ass. Hailey, you're violent. Uh, okay. If someone tries to do some shit to my girl, I have to get him. I'm serious, Starr. I will go after him. I will kick his ass. I do not care. You just say the word. Hailey must've watched Straight Outta Compton again last night. You just say the word, and I'm gonna do it. What did you say to him? We're not really talking right now, so... Who's not really talking to whom? Well, Chris lured Starr over to his house and sprung a condom on her. What did you say? No, no, no. What did you do? What size was it? Maya! Oh, my God! You're on a "need to know." Okay! And I need to know. Look, Chris is great, but I'm just not ready. And eventually, I'll get there, but he just assumed. Assuming. Punishable by death. So, you're gonna Taylor Swift this? She doesn't even rank on the angry girlfriend scale anymore. Nah. I'm gonna Beyonce his ass. Watch.

I don't like what you did the other day. Starr, I'm sorry. - I messed up. Bad. - Mm-hmm. But I keep thinking that we're getting closer... and ask to take you out on Saturday, and you don't say yes. - I'm busy. - Right. Every time? So I figure maybe you want me to meet your parents first. But whenever I ask to come over, you never say yes. They're busy too. Well, it seems like everyone's busy, Starr. So then I think, "How do I get closer to my own girlfriend? Maybe she wants to skip the whole flowers and chocolate part and just get right to it." Chris, you are acting a damn fool, if you think I'm one of these little thirsty girls running around here that you can hit. Starr, you're not. You're way more important than that to me, okay. We've been dating for almost six months. And if you can't tell that by now, then I don't know what else you want me to say. Other than I miss you. A lot. I made that beat for you. Come on. You gotta tell me that's fire. It's a'ight. I wanna hear you say it. It's okay. Wow. Okay. I guess that means I gotta test it. I'm fully aware that some people would accuse him of acting black, but this is just Chris. And he makes me laugh. Hey! Get it, man! Oh, my God. Don't spin. Come on. Do you forgive me now? Yeah. We get the questions. Why is he dating her? On the real, I sometimes wonder the same thing. Now, the stares usually come from the rich white girls. But they're way too scared to actually say anything to our faces. Let me take you somewhere on Saturday. To do what? We can eat burgers. I let you beat me in foosball... Let me beat you? - Mm-hmm. - And then we can kiss on a Ferris wheel. That is so cheesy. That's what I got. Okay. But can we do Sunday instead? I'll pick you up? I'll meet you. Augustine's? Mm-hmm. Three o'clock? So romantic. You are a fool. I'm your fool. Yeah. That is true. Chris is the best thing about being Starr Version Two.

Man, ain't that my brother hoodie? Our brother's hoodie, Kenya, yeah. Yeah, dressed like that, got folks thinking you're my girlfriend. Kenya, if I had known following you to this party meant that I would be on some Extreme Makeover Starr Edition mess, I would've stayed home and watched my Fresh Prince reruns. Oh, girl, you got to let the 90s perish. What now? There go that trick, Denasia. Ooh, I can't stand her ass. Always talking smack about how I'm trying to steal her ugly-ass man. Oh, for real? Man, you so lucky you go to that private school. You don't gotta deal with hoes like that. No. There's hoes at my school, too. Trust me, hoedom is universal. Feel my stink eye, bitch.

Ain't like you had shit else to do. I'm doing your black ass a favor. Oh, my God! You do know I have friends, right? Them bougie girls from your school do not count. Yo, Kenya! What up? - Hey. - How you doing? - I'm good. - Hey, boo. Now, you know you ain't have to bring your sister out dressed like that. We ain't sisters. Yeah, just 'cause my mama and her daddy made Seven, don't make us related. I mean, she my girl, but Seven don't make us kin. Anyway, leave Starr alone, Bianca. She's used to partying amongst the whites. Yo, I bet they be poppin' Mollies and all kind of pills, don't they? Listening to Taylor Swift ass trying to sing. Y'all are just reaching...

You ain't got no right to do this to me. Listen, I'm giving you a lawful order. Khalil, listen to him. Is it for failing to signal my lane change or for failing to turn down my music? Which one? Sir, out of the car, now! Either you get out of the car yourself, or I'm gonna do it for you. Now! Drop the phone! Yo, why don't you just give me my ticket? Hands on the car. Anything on you?

Come on, look at me! Look at me, Khalil. Come on! Breathe, Starr. Starr, breathe. Who did that, man? The officer who did it... I understand that. I know. I'm Detective Gomez. And this is my partner, Detective Wilkes. Uh, Lisa Carter. I'm her mother. Starr Carter. Can you tell us what happened tonight, Starr? I went to this party. And Khalil was there, too. Why was Khalil there? Same as everybody else, I guess. Just recreational purposes. Witnesses at the party stated that there was an altercation and gunshots. Did Khalil have anything to do with it? Nah. I mean... no. We were, uh, just talking... when the fight broke out. He offered to take me home because he wanted to make sure that I got home safely. And that's when 115 pulled us over for no reason. Who? The officer. That's his badge number. I remember it. Starr, do you know why Khalil reached into the car? I think he was checking to see that I was okay. You think? You don't know? No, I don't know. Because? Because that's when it happened. - Did you and Khalil... - Uh... Would you please just give her a second? Whenever you're ready. Okay, baby? We understand that this is hard right now. Do you? Yes, Mrs. Carter, we do. Take your time. Did you drink alcohol at the party? No, I don't drink. Did Khalil? Not that I saw. Did you ever see Khalil sell narcotics? No, I never personally saw Khalil sell drugs or do drugs. But you knew that he did? You have not asked my daughter one question about the cop. We just want the whole picture, miss. That's all. Well, you ask questions about what happened. 115 killed Khalil. And he didn't do anything wrong. So I don't know what more of a bigger picture you need! She's done here. Come on, Lisa. Come on, Starr. You know her? Yeah, she's my niece. All right. All right. I'm here. I'm here. Yeah. Let it out. Let it out. Easy. Let it out. Yeah, let it out. Here. Here. It's okay, baby. It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay. Here. Drink this now. It's okay, baby. Nightmares are always the worst right after. Sekani, no. Starr first. Let her eat. You know, not everybody got superpowers like you. Shine your light. I ain't name you Starr by accident. Sekani! No! Thank you. You the only real friend that boy ever had. He was mine, too, Miss Rosalie. Police came by. Was you with him, Starr? Yes, ma'am. Thank God he didn't leave this world alone. You been by his side from day one, and you stayed all the way to the end. He was selling that stuff, you know. Can't be for nobody but King. You got some nerve coming in here. What's he doing here? Hey, Carlos. Hi, Lisa. Excuse me. Miss Rosalie, I came by to tell you I'm sorry for your loss. And Pam and I have been praying for you. Thank you so much. There's anything I can do for you... know we are here for you. Love you. Look out. So what's the deal? His ass in jail? They're gonna place him on paid administrative leave. That's it? After he killed Khalil? Starr, there will be a full investigation. Cops investigating cops, huh? You know they should've charged his racist ass with murder. But that ain't gonna happen, is it, Uncle Carlos? Nothing like this has ever happened with this officer before. Oh, first-timer. Let's cut him a break. Carlos, you're gonna help with the investigation, right? I can't. We hand situations like this over to the DA. We headed for a grand jury? Most likely. And let me guess, they gonna ask Starr to testify. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want everyone knowing that Starr is the witness. She doesn't need that kind of attention. No! Should we get a lawyer? Witnesses don't need attorneys. Starr ain't just a witness, 'Los. Look, if you don't trust the system, can you at least trust me? - Starr is like my daughter. - But she ain't. It didn't seem that way when you was locked up. Stop it! Both of you! What does a grand jury mean? Grand jury. Stuff like this ends up on the news. People get death threats. Cops target them. What will it mean at school? Will I suddenly be the poor girl from the hood who saw her friend get killed? I just gotta be quiet. Can you just give me more chicken? - Starr, open! - Starr! Starr, pass it! Damn! Starr, just pretend the ball is a piece of fried chicken! - What was that? - What? It's game talk. Fried chicken is game talk? I've never heard that one before. Holy shit. Starr, we had fried chicken for lunch? I-It was a joke. Okay. Wait. What's going on, girl? I mean, you know me, I know you, better than anyone. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just tired. All right. Imma put Mav's hot links on the grill. Little burnt on top and crusty on the side. Y'all go ahead and take some pound cake while y'all wait. - Thanks, Mr. Reuben. - Thank you, Mr. Reuben. ...17-year-old black teenager by a white police officer Saturday night. New information is being released regarding the shooting death of Khalil Harris. Dashcam footage, where the officer thought he was going for a weapon shows it was not a gun but a hairbrush. My son ain't never done nothing wrong! - Khalil was a good boy! - Mm-hmm. Why'd they have to do that to hi? What this hae to happen fo? What, he can't even walk down the stret and brush his damn hai? I mean, why would they put Miss Brenda on TV like that? There's a witness to the shooting who'll be called to testify in front of the grand jury. Community leaders are up in arms... So you famous now. What? I saw you leave with Khalil. Now you all jittery and jumpy and shit. It's you, Starr. Don't even lie. You ready to stir some shit up? What you mean? Well, you was there, so you gotta tell everybody what happened. You're gonna stand up for Khalil, right? Listen, Brenda can't be the only one talking. You know Khalil would've stood tall and spoke for you. Hey, queens. Hi, Daddy! Get in the car. Nah, I'm good. I'll take you up to Big Mav's.

Hurt like that don't never leave you. But you gotta keep pushing. You feel me? Mama at the house? I don't know. Iesha be where she at. Ew. What about Seven? Why your daddy and Iesha name that boy Seven? What's his middle name? Eight? Hey, Uncle Mav. Hey, Kenya. How's that domestic life treatin' you? You go ahead, put a ring on Iesha. You gonna find out. Look like business is going well. Guess I should've bought this store for me instead of you. But you didn't. I heard about Starr's homeboy. Man, you know how they do. Shoot first, ask questions later. You really should try and keep her out of trouble. Trouble? I'm just saying, I think it's best if she don't talk to Five-O. You feel me? You ain't got to worry about Starr. You take care of your girl, and I'll handle mine. - It's like that? - It's exactly like that. Hey, Starr. Remember what I told you, all right? You keep that shit in your rearview. Mnh-mnh. I'm telling you. He was threatening her! He ain't gonna hurt her. He will. If he thinks that Starr is gonna tell the police that Khalil worked for him, he will. And then what? Hmm? He's gonna rope you right back in. Once a King Lord, always a King Lord. When you spend three years in lockup doing somebody else's time, ain't no roping back in. He let me out. That was our deal. Maverick... we're moving. Baby, we could do some good stuff around here. Where you live does not define who you are, Maverick. - Baby, listen to me... - No! You listen! It's okay to make sacrifices for your family. God! Do you think that my mother moved me and Carlos out of Garden Heights and into that Catholic school so we could learn how to pray? No. I'm gonna make sure that my kids have it at least as good as I did. If not, what's the point? That's why we have them up there in that school! And what do you think that school will do when they find out that Starr was with Khalil? Hmm? Those white folks, they love to boast about how diverse that school is, but you know what? This is too much diversity for them. I don't feel good, so I'm not going. None of us feel good, Starr, but we're pressing on anyway. So you go get dressed. - I... - Go get dressed. - Can I come in? - Yeah. Maybe when we get back... we can watch that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Half-Blood Gumble Ghosts. I think I'm good, Daddy. You the worst person to watch Harry Potter with. The whole time you're like, "Harry Potter is about the gang theory." - It is. - Mm-hmm. Hogwarts houses have they own colors, they own hideouts, and they always ridin' for each other. How that ain't about gangs? - You know I'm right. - Mm-hmm. Y'all had y'all's own little Harry Potter gang. Now Natasha and Khalil both gone, and you still here. Trying to make some sense out of it. It's THUG LIFE. "The Hate U Give Little Infants..."
