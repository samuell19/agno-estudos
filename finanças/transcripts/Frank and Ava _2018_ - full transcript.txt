Music flash. Is The Voice now just the gargle? Whether temporary or otherwise, the old black magic that once made thousands swoon when Mr. S wrenched "Night and Day" from his sapling frame is gone from the throat. The bobby-soxers are no longer hypnotized by the vocals, no longer swayed by the music. In fact, they are, thank goodness, no longer. Crooner boy Frank Sinatra's charm seems to have gone a fleeting. Maybe the bobby-soxers are getting more absorbed in such little matters as the H-bomb. With up-and-comers Perry Como and Eddie Fisher climbing the charts making waves, Frank is officially yesterday's news. Nothing personal, Frankie. But you know what they say: Hot today, cold as a corpse tomorrow. ♪ The wrong romance ♪ ♪ Word from the wise ♪ ♪ That they don't know The feeling... ♪ Mr. Selznick has personally selected you, Señorita Valley. Oh, yes, I'm going to do a movie with Mr. Hitchcock. Look at Selznick with the flavor of the month. Goodness. She's practically flaunting those diamonds, isn't she? Oh, we've been hearing quite a bit about you, Marilyn, these days, especially your jewelry, dear. Isn't it dreamy? David Selznick spent a lot of flavors of the month though: Lena Horne, Grace Kelly, Lana Turner. - Where are you from, honey? - Philadelphia. And despite of what Mr. Field says, it's a very nice place. Poor Nancy, it's so humiliating. You covered it so thoroughly. As did you, Lila. Speaking of which, where's the star of hit parade? I'm sure he's here somewhere. I saw his goons lurking about. Surprised he shows his face at all after reading your column. Just stating the facts, dearie. Just the facts. What do they call him? A hundred and nineteen pounds has-been? That's right. Let's be nice, ladies. He's put on a little meat since. Oh, it doesn't matter as long as it's nineteen pounds of cock. Let me guess. Washing his hands again? Oh, he's worried about his throat, so he's washing all the germs off. The germs or the guilt? They busted him again. This... this whole Maxwell business, press got him cold this time. Mortimer, Winchell, The Hat. They got nothing. That's why we're here. I can't do this anymore. I have talked to him about the broads and money and Nancy. The public knows. They know. They don't like him anymore. You know what they call his show? Saturday Nightmares. Come on, why are you reading that crap? My prediction... he'll be through in a year. He'll be dead professionally. They're not gonna see his pictures. They are not gonna can buy his records. The public will not care about Frank Sinatra. Hello, gentlemen. Where is he? Where's Frank? Well, I do not know. I am not his keeper, am I? Well, he needs to speak to me about something very important. He needs my help. Because you've done so much already. What Jack is trying to say is you had... have always given Frank a fair shake. Right? I think he's out by the pool. Don't fall in, you might ruin that hat. What a witch. ♪ Breaking up now It's understood ♪ ♪ What my dreams are made of ♪ Alone at last. You move right along, don't you? I thought I'd come and say hello given last time we met, we sort of rushed things. You rushed things. I was on a date. Check how I've used. How can I forget? Suppose we start over. So, how are you doing? Making pictures as usual. How about you? I'm trying to pick myself off my ass. How's that working out for you? Most of the times not. So... So... Why don't we get out of here? Where did you learn how to shoot, huh? All right, what kind of crazy... Howdy, officer. Working late? Meet Chester, the working stiff. Ma'am, I'm gonna need to take that revolver from you. This little old thing? I bet it's not as big as the one you're packing. Oh... - Ain't she something? - She sure is. Boy, this is sure one-horse town. Where's the horse? Hello? Hello, Ma'am, would you mind waking up the sheriff? It's... it's sort of important. Hang on. Lloyd! - What? - Telephone. All right. What's so important they should call at this hour, hmm? Hello. Sherriff, Sir, it's me, Sir. Huh? You're not gonna believe this. I've got Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. Frank Sinatra... Yeah, yeah, I've heard of them. I'm bringing them in, Sir. Alright, alright, I'll be right down. Shit. He got a couple of celebrities down there, Frank Sinatra and Ava... What's her name? - Ava Gardner? - Yeah, Ava Gardner. Alright. Well, wait, hold them... hold them there till I get dressed, will you? Evening, Miss. It smells bad in here. It's bug spray, Ma'am. How about a phone, pops? Yeah, pops, how about it? Sure. You're gonna have a phone call. Jimmy. "Senior" is great. Is that Spanish? It's beautiful. Hmm, Jack, it's for you. Sounds like our boy is lit up like a Christmas tree. Frank. Look, we're in trouble. When I left you at the gentlemen's party you seemed to be in good hands. In the old police station of all places. Police? Sherriff Lloyd Boyle. And... get this... I know he is long in the tooth. I think some of those teeth are made of wood. Sober up, clam up, put the sheriff on. I want to talk to Frankie. Would you give me a break here? It's for you. Pardon me, Miss. Sherriff Boyle, Jack Keller here. Well, I just want to thank you for your discretion and looking after Frank. We all appreciate it. I appreciate your feeling that way, Mr. Keller. I'm sure you are as big fan of Frank as the rest of us. No, never been much of a fan. My wife is. Well, Sir, we want to take care of you. Where exactly are you located? - Right here in Indio. - Indio. That's just past Palm Desert, Cathedral City, Rancho Mirage. Just past the cemetery. Are you sure there isn't anything Frank can do for you? You just name it, anything at all. Uh, well, oh, come to think of it, my wife and I have been fishing one of these new gizmos. A television set maybe? Sheriff Boyle, we could definitely make that happen. We'll see you soon. Okay now? Thank you. Are we going to Indio? - Would you take care of that? - Whoopee! Not you, tuts, you can have another nightcap. Jesus. I'm a wreck. How long are they gonna keep us here? As long as it takes Jack Keller to drive out here from Los Angeles. Is he a lawyer? Worse. A PR man. Will he be able to spring us? Fix is in the weeks. Lana Turner says you get your kicks acting like a hoodlum. Well, Lana Turner has some mouth on her. Funny. She says the very same thing about you. Forget Lana Turner. - I only have eyes for you. - Oh. This coming from a married man. What's my wife have anything to do with it? Back in North Carolina proper ladies do not associate with married men. Well, I may not be a saint but you ain't no angel either. Mel Tormé told me all about you. That goddamn crooner? What's wrong with crooners? You're all spoiled rotten and you murder on young girls. Guilty as charged. Inbred hayseed. Hoboken hoodlum. Redneck. Oh my, oh my. A good behavior will get all? Sudden cookie, huh? Francis! ... as my poor little country gal. That's me, all right. Just a hillbilly with a pair of tits and ass. Wooo, someone's got to work on their little self-esteem. Don't you try to psychoanalyze me, Mr. I'm All Washed Up. Cut it out. All my tomorrows belong to you, baby. Pretty big talk, Mister S. What talk? I'm on fire for you, kitten. Fire? Trust me honey, it won't last. Pretty soon you'll want to mold me and sculpt me like all the other men in my life. This ain't my first rodeo, cowboy. Lee Mortimer here. It would appear, unless he slugged someone, Frank Sinatra can't get arrested these days. The latest rejection for the washed-up crooner who's been missing in action as well as from the charts comes from the USO. It seems that the army doesn't want Sinatra entertaining our troops in Korea due to serious questions according to General Alfred E. Kaisner as to his sympathies to communist, communism and unsavory fellow travelers. It's about that time that the police had a perfect case of murder in the first degree against Mr. Anastasia for indictment. He don't look so bad. He's wearing makeup. Makeup? He's a rat, not a Fenoitz. Yeah. Well, somebody's gonna take it in the ass after this. Hey Frank, tell me something. How could you tell a guy's wearing makeup? Will you turn this crap off? I'm trying to concentrate. Oh yeah, that book game, Frank, very depressing. No, it's just a new one. From Here to Eternity. Yeah, it's about the army. Love the war story? Frank, the war's over. Cut the crap. Crap? Just listen. We surveilled the subject and observed him interact with known associates of Mr. Willie Moretti. Riveting. Beg your pardon? Oh, you got a knack for it. You sound like the shadow. I love that stuff. Detective, you are on loan to assist Mr. Hoover's bureau. Your commentary... Relax. He's not going anywhere. "The bronze glow lighting his thin child's face. 'I'll see you, kid', he said, puffing luxuriantly, like a rich man on a fifty-cent cigar. It's on the bestseller list. Hey, Columbia bought the rights. Yeah, they are making a movie. Yeah? Hey, Frank, is there a part in this movie for you? Is there...? Ain't you been paying attention? Hooligan... hooligan. Mm-Hm. As long as there's still Double Dynamite. Hide, Hide! Where's Frank? Where is he? Where's Frank? This is his haircut day. Well, you can see he's not here, right? I think he's making a movie. Where the hell was that? Hawaii. I didn't know you could read. These are dangerous times, fellas. Frank needs to talk to me. Tell him. Frank, you need to talk to her. I wouldn't be surprised if you and MGM parted ways, Frank. This Marilyn Maxwell business won't sit well with LB. I'm a family man, you know that. Frank, you're a public personality and that includes Nancy and the children. What's Nancy been telling you? That her kids wait by the phone for daddy to check in while he's out cavorting with the latest husband-snatching hussy. Look, LB and I are okay. We did a lot of good pictures together. Casablanca was a good picture, Frank. It didn't save Bergman. And now you're starting with Howard Hughes' trophy girl. At least they won't deport me. Listen, dearie, the pictures have been direct too. Miracle of the Bells? What a hunk of religious baloney. You're on very thin ice, Frank. Frank. Frank. Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America. Hang on to your bobby socks. FS, suspected by many of having communist sympathies, is now a certified moral reprobate. The married voiceless crooner has been spotted shamelessly occupying the shadow of one Ava Gardner. Frankie, that's some shadow, but what would the Pope say? As for the sultry screen siren, no stranger to swooning suitors, good evening, Mr. Hughes, legion of decency be aware. I'm tired. I ain't no criminal. I ain't no coward. Heaven help us. From Here to Eternity? You haven't put that down in weeks. For good reason. It's great. You better read it. Isn't the book, what, five hundred pages long? That's right. You're from North Carolina. You're the stick to the Sears Roebuck catalog in a family outhouse. Jesus. You sound just like Artie. He was always putting me down, criticizing my intelligence. Your ex was a prick, the biggest prick around. You compare me to him? You asked for it. Stop tutoring me, Francis. I'm not tutoring you. Sure as hell are. Read this, read that. Bullshit. I'm just trying to make you understand why this is so important to me. It's obvious. You're hoping they'll past you as Angelo Maggio. Give the lady a cigar. Breakfast? Will you knock it off? What's with this Angelo Maggio? Why are you so obsessed with him? He's a buck private from Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn. And you have heard of Brooklyn, haven't you? Oh, fuck you, Francis. He's a fast talker streetwise cat that doesn't give a shit about the army. I know him, Ava. I mean if I get a chance to play Angelo Maggio, I can hit a home run with the bases loaded. Okay, okay, I believe you. You'll make a great Maggio. Are you kidding? The part was made for me. I gotta get this part. I'll kill myself if I don't get this role. Stop being so damn melodramatic. You're the greatest entertainer this country has ever known. Losing a lousy film role isn't gonna change that. My voice is shot. Didn't you hear me last? It started scratching and cracking. - People didn't notice. - I noticed. Three o'clock in the morning I was already beat. This is just a bad time. Here, rub my ass. It'll give you good luck. Hey, that's good. Real good. - I feel better already. - Good. I'm glad to be of service. I have to face it. I'm washed up. Not true. When you sang "Someone to Watch Over Me" tonight, I had tears in my eyes. That's 'cause you're prejudiced. Your favorite song. You brought me back to the first time I heard it, when I was, what, ten, twelve years old. Ava Lavinia, you better get in there and do your chores. In a minute. In a minute. He's so dreamy. Dreamy. Silly, silly girl. Feelings that have stayed with me until this very day. Well, you have found the mystery. You found your shepherd. I'll always watch over you. I'll always love you. I don't believe you. ♪ Baby won't you Please come home ♪ ♪ 'Cause your daddy is... ♪ How do I know you're alone? Well, prove to me that you're alone. What do you mean you can't find her? You can find anybody. Frankie. Come with the kids to bed. What the fuck am I paying you for? Well, get over there and find out, goddammit. Never mind that. Let me talk to you. Hello. Well, find her, for crying out loud, alright? I was lousy tonight, wasn't I, huh? My voice was tight, it was cracking. Jesus, don't be so hard on yourself. You can't bat a thousand when you're a singer. Yeah, but you can't strike out every time either. You didn't strike out, champ, you just didn't hit a homerun, that's all. Let's face it. After fifteen years it's over. I lost my voice, I lost my audience. I'm even losing my hair. Yeah, well, that's what hats are for. Now listen, Cookie, we have to talk. The record company decided not to renew your contract. They decided to go with these young guys Perry Como and Eddie Fisher. See, what did I tell you? You see the charts? I'm yesterday's news, Jack. Okay, Frank, let's take a look. Vocal cords may be strained, possibly a little hemorrhage. - Is it serious? - Like fail? No, Frank, but it explains the voice. What now? Two weeks no talking. No talking? What... what about singing? No singing, no screaming, no shouting. - What can I do? - Whisper. When can I sing again? Weeks, maybe months. These things take time, Frank, you know. Perhaps switch to Camels. It's like Joe DiMaggio. Right now you're down. They say you lost your voice. They're kicking you to the curb. Along comes this broad, she makes you feel good. Before I know, she floats you a few books. When I see you, I see an old friend of mine. Benny was a good man. We grew up together. He was handsome. He was tough. He was great with the ladies. He was a visionary. But along came this one broad, nothing special, everyone's been with her. She couldn't keep her legs crossed. But he went nuts for her. He leaves his wife, his kids, he moves out to California. He thinks he's a movie star. Before long he's lost and then everything went bad. The Flamingo couldn't save him. Nobody could save him. Watch out for this movie star, Frank. Don't get lost. Could we for once not talk about Howard Hughes? Why not? You spread it, didn't you? Did you hear that? They're gonna kill each other. Just mind your own business. You son of a bitch. You call that pitching? I guess the Dodgers won't be calling. God damn you. I don't know how many times I've told you I never had sex with him. He bought you jewelry, took on his fucking airplanes. Just because he bought me some trinkets doesn't mean I fucked him. That's right. I forgot. You like band leaders and bullfighters, don't you? Did mama's little choirboy think I was a virgin when he came calling? No, but I think maybe there was someone out there you hadn't fucked. Miserable wop. That clinches it. I'm going upstairs. You do nothing of the kind. Just sit there and hush. You can't even ask your wife for a divorce. How am I supposed to ask her, huh? She's more Catholic than the Pope. Then why don't you get one of your boys to go over there and convince her? You stop talking like that. What's the matter? I thought you were a big tough gangster. Yeah? For crying out loud, I can't believe how they can carry on like that. I can. You've just forgotten how. Alright, Frank, you be a good boy, huh? Kiss your mommy. Daddy will be home later. Okay. I got kids, remember? Wife and family first, right? Is this why we sneak around in strange houses? I'm in love with you, Francis. If I'm in love, I want to get married. Otherwise go back to Nancy. You always go back anyway. I don't want to go back. I love you, baby. I mean sometimes you scare the shit out of me. I don't know what I'm doing with you but I know I can't go without you. Actions, Francis. Actions. Where did you go? Spain? What are you doing in Spain? Hello? Hello? Hank, where the fuck is Mario Cabré? Mario Cabré is a fucking bullfighter, he is writing a poem. Frankie, your voice. Fucking guy is... I'll call you back. Looking good, Mr. S. If you're going for Zorro. - Looks authentic, right? - Yeah. If I didn't even know you any better, you'd look like one of us. Olé! Any luck? She's not picking up the phone. But when she sees that stash... Never mind that. Go, go, cut the call. C-note? That's the biggest tip you ever got? Got fifty last week. Fifty? What a lousy cheapskate gave you that? That was you, Mister S. Excuse me, aren't you Frank Sinatra? Depends. Who's asking? Former president, three years running of the local chapter of the Sighting Society Swooners. Kid wants an autograph. Great. Here you go, kid. Thanks. Thanks a bunch. You've been served. Son of a bitch. Frankie is planning a trip to Europe, just about the time Ava leaves to make Pandora and the Flying Dutchman with James Mason. Beautiful. Beautiful. One for your fans, Ava. Ava, right here. Beautiful. Right there. - Hey, there is Frank. - That's right. What are you two doing over there in Spain? Well, she got some sun and I caught a few tuna. I was making a movie with Hemingway. And we were chaperoning the whole time just like high school dance. So Frank, you're gonna ask Nancy for divorce so you two can get married? Well, I'm in no position for a divorce, so. Oh come off it, Frank. You blew off Nancy on Mother's Day. Yeah. Then what next? A divorce in Mexico and then you two get hitched in Reno? How about that one, Francis? Hey look, fellas, you know, everyone's talking about Ava and me getting married, except Ava and me. Come on, Frank, you snuck off to be with her. Come on, tell us what's the stories. Give me a break, fellas. It's just a vacation. Oh yeah, sure, with a chaperone. Yeah, we get it guys. Yeah, who is the chaperone, Mario Cabré? Oh wait, wait, maybe Frank was the chaperone. Hey Frank, so how'd you feel about when he started serenading her with all the poetry? It was a publicity gimmick for the film, alright? Just back the fuck off. Hey, you can't talk like that. The press made you, Frank. The press didn't make me. My singing did, your miserable crumb. What the hell was all that about? Can't get a divorce just now? Can you forget those leeches? You know I want to marry you, baby. Actions Francis. Actions. I think I hit something. I definitely did. I'm gonna tell her. You want to see action? I'll show you action. I will do it. Nancy! For you, baby, I'm going to tell her right now. Nancy, can you tell Ava that I asked you for a divorce? Frank, are you out of your mind? - I wouldn't count on it. - Let him go. Go, go. - Hey ma. - Let him go. Go. She's in the car. You can't keep a man if he doesn't want to be here. Go. He brings that white trash whore to my house. Now the one I feel really sorry for is little Nancy. She's such a fine woman. You just scared the kids, alright? The kids? Maybe the kids should know about daddy. Maybe they should know all the nights I was home alone with them while daddy was out gallivanting around. What gallivanting? I was out singing, make the records, doing what I gotta do to put a roof over our head. Is that why you slept with Lana Turner? I get well with Lana Turner. Oh, and a diamond bracelet on Marilyn Maxwell so she could flaunt it around in my face? Hey, you go snooping around, I'm not responsible for what you find. That was in our car, damn it. I thought it was for me. And then I see her wearing it. I felt so stupid. You weren't stupid, alright? You were my best friend. I was your wife. I still am your wife. But now I'm not enough, am I? Am I? Not like that. You are in love with her, aren't you? That green-eyed filthy white trash whore has got her hooks in you? You broke your promise. What promise? Why you talking about promise? I had the abortion, Frank. You promised me that you would change if I took you back. And I believed you. You lied. You left me alone with the kids while you're running around with your mob friends and this home-wrecking Jezebel and I get to read all about it in the papers. It's not my fault what they write in the papers, alright, Nancy? I'm sorry that Lee Mortimer is a rat. He writes whatever the fuck he wants to write. Ah Francis, wake up. It's not the press, it's you. You don't give a damn who you hurt. Just go. Get out. Take your suits, your hats, your ties. Get out. I think we should get a divorce. I'm not gonna make it easy, Mister. I'm not giving you a divorce. Where are you going, daddy? Daddy is gonna go make a record, cupcake. Keep an eye on things, will you? This will be the third separation for the couple and with Nancy taking the initiative this time, it looks like the real thing. Items we doubt that F Sinatra's parting from his wife is a gimmick to attract the attention he used to get by crooning. What's Frankie doing in New York? It has to do with those hearings on television, investigating the mob. He's meeting with the attorneys at 4:00 a.m. to avoid the press. You think they're gonna put him on television? If they do, it'll be like a death sentence. If he gets called before the committee, Harry Cohn will never read him for the role of Angelo Maggio. Well, can't you do something? I mean, we know what Harry likes. You ever have any business with any of the Fischettis? No, Sir. Did either of the Fischettis ever give you anything to carry into Cuba? No, Sir. There has been stated and certified information to the effect that you took a sum of money in excess of one hundred thousand dollars into Cuba. That is not true. Did you give Lucky Luciano any money? No, Sir. Did you even learn what business they were in? No, actually not. What is your attraction to these underworld characters? I don't have an attraction for them. Some of them were kind to me when I started out. You want me to believe you don't know the people we've been talking about are hoodlums and gangsters who have committed many crimes and are probably members of a secret criminal club? Now you're not gonna put me on television and ruin me just because I know some of these guys, are you? Nobody's trying to ruin you. The Dodgers will leave from Brooklyn. That's never gonna happen. Never say never. Look at the Giants. How many games they behind in... in August, huh? Thirteen games behind in August. Yeah, but then now they are even with the Dodgers. So if they win tomorrow, they win the pennant. You know why I like that rookie colored kid though, how was he? With the Giants. - Mays. Willie Mays. - Mays! He's beautiful. He's gonna be a big star. Hey Carmine, you're gonna watch him or you're gonna fuck him? That's true. Now, let me ask you something wise guys, huh? Why do they call the Brooklyn's the Dodgers? Trolley Dodgers from all the trolley racing up and down Atlantic and Flatbush Avenue. Oh, give it the rest, boys. Out of the mountains. - Hey, hey. Look who's here. - Come on, Frankie. Hey. Get over here, you. Give me a kiss, you fucking Sicilian bastard. Sit here near your godfather. He'll know. Frankie, what is this constellation thing here? Sure, I flew him, Uncle Willie. I flew him to Europe, Los Angeles, Havana. He even got bunks he could sleep in. Even bunks. But they could use to serve some coffee, especially on the long flights. What, no coffee? Howard Hughes, he wouldn't even go for coffee? Speaking of Howard Hughes, you still running around with that Ava broad you used to go with? She's with me now, Uncle Willie. Look, Frank, you're a grown man, you do what you got to do, it's your business, - but family comes first, not that wasp butane. - Understand? Uncle Willie, I take care of my kids, you know that. I'm talking about Nancy. She comes into town, she goes to see my wife, the two of them are like, you know, parrots, you know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? It's a mala faguda, Frankie. You got to... you got to fix this. The... that twat in the newspaper, what's her name? Hedda Hopper? Ah, what's she saying about you Frank. I'm not saying you got to move in with her but you gotta make it nice and nice, you know, sing her a little love song. Hey, remember Slapsie Maxie? ♪ Nancy with the Smiling... ♪ No, no, laughing. Laughing Face. ♪ If I don't see her each day I miss her ♪ Knock it off, knock it off! Come on. Come on, Frankie... How you doing? Everything else alright? You need anything? No, I'm good, don't you worry. I'm good. Frank, tell Willie about that book I always see you reading - about the Italian American soldier in the war. - From Here to Eternity. It's a terrific book. It's gonna make a great picture. You're gonna be in a picture? Yeah, that's my boy. Well, not so fast. I mean they haven't given me the part yet. You need me to talk to somebody here? Well, I know the head of the studio, Harry Cohn, and he knows me. Harry Cohn. We know this guy, Johnny? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that... that's the guy that's around the Joey A. Yeah, gambler. Jew. Big time. Matter of fact, he left our booster with your partner in the marina. Yeah. Well, perfect parlay. They go out to California to tour them, they go pay a visit to this fucking producer, huh, alright Frankie? No? It's not that easy Uncle Willie. This producer Harry Cohn, he shut out eighty-two thousand bucks for the screenwriters. I mean he's not just gonna give away a part. Besides, with this Kefauver Committee you can't go out there and make waves. It's too risky. Remember my television with me? Mr. Moretti, you were a member of the mafia. Yeah, come down to the shore, I'll show you my fucking membership card. Besides, when the studio was hanging by a thread and I was big, I did him a big favor. I helped him out. So, this guy owes me. Alright Frank, let's go. I gotta go, guys. Take care. I'll see you guys later. Bet those fucking Dodgers, alright? Listen to me, don't worry about it, this is no different than that fucking leave. Besides, after tomorrow, how about the 82? I'll give it back to him, alright? Everything will be good. I love you, alright? I gotta go set up the bar. Excuse me, boys. You're a good man, Frank. You sing but you don't talk. How you doing, Mike? Watch out for that favor, Frank. Willie Moore likes to talk. He talks to the reporters, he goes on television, he makes jokes. Not you, right, Frank? Hello and goodbye. I notice things like that. News flash. Willie Moore is no more. Shots rang out at Joe's Elbow Room restaurant in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, where racketeer and gambler Willie Moretti was executed gangland style in a hail of bullets. The fifty-seven-year-old Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey resident who reportedly had fallen out of favor with La Cosa Nostra, due to his large gambling debts and for talking too much to congressional investigative committees was a known longtime associate of another former Hasbrouck Heights resident, one F. Sinatra, who even sang at the wedding of a Moretti daughter in 1947. Despite the declining crooner's connection with Moretti and other underworld figures, Senator Kefauver's committee declined to call Sinatra to testify and thus spared him a public lambasting that would have no doubt finished off a career already on life support. What's this thing you have for the mafia? I don't have a thing for the mafia. Then why are you always hanging out with them? I started singing in New Jersey, remember? Most of the clubs and gin mills are owned by the boys. But you're not singing in New Jersey anymore. You're singing in Las Vegas. Yeah? Who do you think runs that town, the Salvation Army? According to Lee Mortimer you're just a washed-up crooner who's now a bagman for the mob. Yeah, well Mortimer is a fink. Now's the perfect time for you to cut your ties with these people. What are you saying? Turn my back on my friends? It's an Italian thing. Yeah, an Italian thing. So, it's something you wise can't understand. Basic human values like friendship and loyalty. Stop your ranting. It's not gonna change your public image. My public image will change once I get to play Angelo Maggio. From Here to Eternity is a whole different ball of wax. They're testing heavyweight actors for the role you want. Harvey Lembeck, Eli Wallach. Hey, those guys don't scare me. They can only play Maggio from the outside. I can play him from the inside. I am Angelo Maggio. My little tap dancer in a sailor suit. And I can make it happen, especially you picking a little help. Meaning? You are friends with Harry Cohn's wife, right? So why don't you meet with her and then work to her husband? Francis, isn't pulling strings like that a Hollywood no-no? Baby, I wanna help, I really do, but I've been offered a part in another movie. Another movie? It's called Mogambo. John Ford's directing. What's the part like? It's good, baby. Real good. Oh good. Oh good. Yeah. - The best catch. - Catch? - It's gonna be shot at a location. - Location? Yes, in Africa. Africa? Where did my little guinea go? So, a diamond is your best friend? What do you say we get married? Francis. Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America. Hang on to your body socks. Frank and Ava to get married. Oh baby, I love the sound of that. Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner got married only days after his formal divorce. The couple married in a private home in Philadelphia before slipping away only to be spotted the next day walking along a Havana shore in what anyone could call beach attire. Truth is the only time I'm happy is when I'm doing absolutely nothing. Whatever do you mean by that, dear? Anybody want a lollipop? Let's put it this way. I was going to be a secretary, but I'd rather be a star. Are you kidding, a secretary? You'll be selling yourself short. You're a star. Hey nice outfit, Frank. Hold that. Hold that. You remember her in Showboat, don't you? She held her own with Kathryn Grayson, Howard Keel. You lit up the screen. Come on and have a drink with me, baby. I'm bored all by myself. Not until I make an omelet fit for a queen. After all, the article she's inscribing is entitled "Breakfast with the Sinatras." How simply adorable. I didn't know Frank could be so subservient. Holding doors, pulling out chairs, lighting your cigarette. Marriage, ain't it something? To get back to your question, I'll go on acting as long as it gives me financial security. Is it true about you wanting a family? Well, sure, any time. I'm ready. God, I look sick, don't I? Terrific. You just gotta eat, that's all. Voilá. That looks absolutely scrumptious. Frank, they say there isn't anything you wouldn't do for Ava. Sure. Anything for my angel. Even doing theater in Nairobi? I'd sing namaz if that meant being close to you, baby. But they say being married to Ava is like sitting on cracked eggs. You never know what kind of mood she's gonna be in. Nonsense. The only cracked eggs are the ones I used to make this omelet. Now let's see. Next topic, dearie. So, in your country you are an actress, right? Yes. And you speak good English, right? Yes. And in your country possums pilot airplanes, right? - Yes. - Yeah, right. God damn it, can't you see I'm busy? Mr. C, I'm so sorry. Mr. Zinnemann, Mr. Adler, they just barged in. What the hell do you want? You can't be out of money, you haven't started shooting yet. It's the Maggio. What about it? We keep getting telegrams from Sinatra asking when he can audition. He's saying you promised the testing. I mean he signs the telegrams "Maggio", for crying out loud. Mr. Cohn, I think we've got our guy. Yeah? Eli Wallach, stage actor, New York, Actors Studio. Yeah, I saw him in the roles. That's who is. He's brilliant. Wasn't he brilliant? - Yeah. - Works with the Elia Kazan. Elia Kazan. I think he's a communist. I don't need trouble. Works? Who said works? Fred, I don't think they actually worked together. Did I mean work? He didn't mean work. He meant that... that they know each other. - Isn't that what you meant, Fred? - They... they know each other. They know each other? Yeah, I mean they met a couple of times, once or twice at the very most, isn't that right, Fred? They met at the theater, the Actors Studio. I mean it's a big theater, plenty of seats. You know, and besides, I mean, who has more baggage than Sinatra with the divorce, living with Ava Gardner? You got a point. Okay, fine, done deal. Now get the hell out of here, both of you. Minna. This way, gentlemen. No kidding, he'll be great. This is terrific. We already spoke to his agent and we can get him for twenty-thousand dollars. Whoa, whoa twenty thousand dollars? Hold the wire. Hold the wire. Darling, do me favor. Give me a second now, will you doll? Yes. Minna, have her wait outside. Bye-bye, Lubov. Hello. - Minna, get me this... what's the name again? - Eli Wallach. Give me this Eli... Eli Wallach's agent on the phone. Sit down, boys. Twenty-thousand smackers, who the hell he think he is, Gable? Mr. C, Ava Gardner is on the line, she's with Mrs. C and they've just had lunch. Sorry boys, but I need you to clear out. Send her, what's the name, back in. - Lubov. - Yeah, Lubov. Ava, Ava, Ava. Hello, hello, hello. I was just thinking about you. Lee Mortimer here. The crowning blow for Frankie boy is that the Music Corporation of America announced its decision to withdraw him as his agent. Hey. How is that very bad boy of yours? Don't worry darling. Mommy's got him under control. - I just met... - Harry, hello. Ms. Ava, or should I say Mrs. Frank? - Claudia was just leaving. - Excuse me, Claudia. When are we going to work together? Next time you're in town call my girl, tell her to pencil you in. Oh, come on Harry, don't play with me. Tell her five o'clock. I'll either make you a movie star or I'll marry you. Can I pour you a drink? You got a lot of nerve calling my wife. I love Joan. I hope she's feeling better. She was under the weather when we had lunch. You had lunch? I'm sure it was lovely. You mind telling me what you talked about at this lunch? Harry, you know that no-good bastard husband of mine is perfect for the role of Maggio in this picture you're doing. Ah, you don't say. Harry, the role was made for him. And I suppose you think I should give him an audition, huh? It's like chutzpah. Don't you want me to be happy? Yeah. You got more balls than half the men I know. So, how about we go somewhere more quiet, talk about this. Director Fred Zinnemann has gone to New York to test stage players for From Here to Eternity. Meanwhile, Frank is still pitching hard for that Maggio role. The Eternity film could open up a completely new phase in Sinatra's acting career. What is so important? Is it Ava? It's all the wires that you two are desperately trying to avoid a crack-up? We're having oral battles but I'm trying to fix it all up. Oral battles, sounds like pornography. Fix her, Frank. You don't need no more heat from the press. Between divorce and Nancy and this asshole Mortimer, you got plenty. Harry, I want to play Maggio. I know you want to play Maggio. I got your telegrams. We all got your telegrams, sometimes twice a week You know, Buddy's thinking of paving his washroom with your telegrams. - Harry, me and you go way back, right? - Yeah. The role is written about a guy just like me. Yeah. But can you play a guy like you? It is me, Harry. You must be out of your fucking mind. That's an actor's part, not a crooner. You're a crooner. I'm an actor. Come on, give me a chance to act. What do you from acting? You know how to sing and you can sing with the best of them. You know how to dance and you got a good smile. William Powell knows from acting. You don't know from acting. Give me one more of these. You know what I know from acting? I'm watching a dog like... what's a good dog, Double Dynamite. Double Dynamite. And I squirm in my seat from the pain of my tuchus. All right, I admit that was dreck. But Maggio is completely different. They are testing serious actors. Eli Wallach, he's a stage actor. - About the money? - Who's talking of money? But what about the money? I used to get a hundred fifty thousand a picture, right? You used to get a hundred fifty thousand a picture, yes. I'll do it for expenses. Give me expenses, you got your Maggio. You want it that bad, huh Frank? Harry, it's me. We'll see, Frank, we'll see. Let me think it over. - You are not turning me down? - I was but we'll see, we'll see. You won't regret it, Harry. One more thing. You tell anybody about this, I'll kill you, you son of a bitch. Frank, are you up to Africa to visit Ava? I miss my wife. I miss my wife. There is like lions, baters... - Clark Gable. - Thank you. Hey, Gable shot mixed this week. What do you got to say about that? How do you feel about Ava working with the King? Clark Gable is the greatest actor of our time. Yeah. You gonna be working with Ava on Mogambo? I'm gonna put black paste and play a native, okay? So, you're not gonna work at all? I'm gonna sing in a couple of nightclubs in Nairobi, alright? Who's gonna open, Tarzan? Very funny. Bing Crosby, the greatest singer of our time, folks. Wait a second, Frank. Stop it, you can't ask that. No, Frank is bigger. Really? Bigger? No way. Thank you, Ndungo. Asante. Asante. Asante. Hi, papa. Hello, ladies. Evidently, I am your new valet. Oh, for me? - Here, one for you too. - Oh. Looks like the King summons. Frank is coming over. He misses me. That little dago. Zinnemann finally agreed to give him that screen test. Did he? Well, on the set I don't mind having Frank, I got no problem with Frank at all. Thank you, papa. Maybe he'll make us that beautiful linguini he loves to make. Thank you. Doctors pumped powerful shots of antibiotics into actress Ava Gardner to beat down a tropical infection picked up while movie-making in Africa. The wife of crooner FS apparently made the mistake of drinking local water in Kenya's nature country and laid in pain with stomach troubles. Meantime, hubby Frank did not make any new friends walking out on Shirley Jones and the set of Carousel. Off to Rome perhaps to join the little missus who's there convalescing. Sounds like the little missus insisted. Who have you told? So far just you. Is it Frank's? Yes. I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure? Half the world's female population would throw themselves at Frank's feet and here you are flouncing around with men who wear capes and little ballerina slippers. Bogie tell you that one? Never mind him. What are you going to do? I'm not having it. It's my insides we're talking about. Besides, the studio would penalize me. It doesn't have to be that way. When I had Stephen and Leslie, I told those sons of bitches to fuck off. That was easy for you to say, you have Bogie. And you have Frank, who lives and dies by you. He is a Catholic, by the way. He would absolutely want you to have his child. Why? So, I can sit at home with his baby, cold, hungry, and in the dark while he and his rats go off chasing tail? Oh for God's sake. There's a clinic in London on Harley Street. You shouldn't go alone. I will go with you. Thank you. Come here and meet me at the airport. I never got your telegram with your time of arrival. Never got? What, it didn't have Western Union office out in the bush? Francis, I'm sorry. Come on up, baby. Gable? How you getting on with Clark Gable? Like a dream. There's a reason why they call him the King. Are you fucking him? What did you say? I asked you a question. Are you fucking Clark Gable? You suspicious son of a bitch. Hey, I know you, that's why. And I know how it goes on movie locations. King Gable is having a big hot thing with the Ice Queen herself, little Miss Grace Kelly. You jealous? You're the jealous one. Can't help myself. I mean that last phone call, you left me all depressed, like, my imagination ran wild. Listen, I asked you to come here, remember? So, why don't you quit giving me the third degree and come over here and fuck me already. You know how much I miss you? Same here. You're my fate, you guinea bastard. You're my fate, you redneck piece of poor white trash. Do you forgive me? I forgive you for everything you did and everything you're gonna do. Okay. Coming out, the terror of Gimbels' basement. Coming out, seven, seven... Don't overdo the slurring of your words. Most people try to hide their drunkenness by slowing down their speech and over-enunciating everything they say. - Where did you learn that? - Michael Chekhov. He's Anton Chekhov's nephew. You should take classes with him. I'll need no classes, I know how to play Angelo Maggio. Michael's a magician with actors. I don't need that Stanislavski bullshit, all right? Don't be so damn cocky. I'm not cocky. Truth be told, I'm scared, all right? That's all right. I get scared when I go on stage to sing. The minute I step on that stage, it's like shazam, I become a different person. It's like magic.

Thank you. - Okay, grazie. - Thank you very much. - Grazie, grazie. - Bye-bye. I thought you said you couldn't get pregnant. Looks like the doctors were wrong. Whose is it? Yours, goddamn it. Is that true? Is it really true? I swear it. Hey, then you must be thrilled, huh? Why do you say that? Oh come on, baby, you love kids, you adore them. It's true I adore them. - But... - But what? I'm not going to have this baby. Hold the wire now, hold on a second. I'm going to fly to London. Somebody told me about a clinic on Harley Street. Whoa, whoa, whoa, a second. - I have no say in the matter? - No, I'm afraid not. Ava, listen, you can't do this to me. What are you talking about? What are you squawking about? You have three kids already, you don't need any more. - That ain't for you to decide. - It sure as hell is. It's my insides we're talking about. Have the kid. I'll help you raise him. It's just not the right time for me to have a child. Ava, listen to me. Back when Nancy and I were on the skids before Frank Jr. was born, she got pregnant. She didn't want to keep it. She said the whole marriage was an abortion. I didn't stop her because I knew she was right. Later on, we patched it up. My son was born. Not a day goes by I don't think about that baby we lost. I need a drink. Mmm. You know what the problem is? - What's the problem? - We're too much alike. We're both selfish, independent, possessive. Anything else? How about hot-headed and competitive? And oversexed. You're sure as hell right about that. Most couple's problems begin in bed. I'm fine with bed. My problems begin on the way to the bidet. No, your problems go back to your childhood. You were spoiled rotten by your brothers and sisters. Same goes for you, Lord Fauntleroy of Hoboken, New Jersey. But I still love you more than I do myself. I swear it, baby. Listen Francis, this decision is mine alone. That means I don't have any say in the matter? Exactly. Mine alone. Is that clear? Listen to me, you go through with this abortion, I'll never speak to you again. And I have anything to fucking do with you ever again. It's fucking funny? Go away. Oh yeah? You want that? Fine.

Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea. News flash. On his way back to the US of A after a less than romantic encounter with new bride Ava Gardner, the crooner was reported to be suffering from a severe case of exhaustion and/or bad press. You've got to give her up, Frank. You don't eat, you don't sleep. The next dollar you make goes to the IRS if you ever work again. I'm not your mother, Frank, but this is not marriage. You're ruining your career chasing after her. It's easy for you to tell me to give her up. You're not the one in love with her. You're lost, Frank. Once you lose it in this town, you never come back. Even Jesus Christ couldn't get resurrected here. What a waste of my time. They should just offer me the fucking role. I was in Gone with the Wind. What are you testing for? - Maggio. - Maggio? They offered that part to Eli Wallach. That's my point. This Hollywood, you know... Hey, pal, I flew in from Nairobi for this. No one, not even Superman's gonna stop me. So clam up. Mr. Sinatra, Zinnemann is ready for you now. Your script? - Oh, I got it all up here. - Oh. You know, I used to sing too. That's nice. I still sort of do but no one really pays me. - I know the feeling. - Huh. What are you looking at, Frankie? Looking at you, love. When the cat's away, the rats take over. Get out of here, girls, mama's home! Daddy won't be needing you. Oh, Frankie... I see you really miss me, you big slimy snake. Darling! I haven't seen you since Africa. Grace Kelly told me all about it. The sweltering heat, the mud, the mosquitoes. Save it, sweetie. We've got a couple of mosquitoes right here. Some real bloodsuckers. Tennis tomorrow? Still looking to smack around some more balls? How was it? Like old times? Do me a favor, don't make a Taj Mahal of a simple fuck. Are you in love with her? I'm in love with you, you green-eyed freak. Then why did you jump her bones again? The same reason why you shacked up with that hunter in Mogambo. What are you talking about? Oh, don't act stupid, kid. Doesn't become you. Who told you about it? You got your spies, I got mine. Neither one of us is marriage material. We can't help but jump into bed with others. Stop talking like that. Stop making trouble. Don't try to shut me up. You're just afraid to commit, that's all. Look who's talking! You don't want commitment. You want to dominate me like all you men do with their women. Francis, I will never let you. You will never conquer me. So, you and your little playmates can just go fuck off. Why don't you crawl back to the jungle you belong? Another word out of you and I will kick you in the nuts. Try it. I'll smash you right in the face. My wife and I, we were blissfully happy for twenty years. And I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, it's as good as they're gonna feel all day. - Is it true what they say? - It's huge. Is there any broad in here he hasn't fucked? He's a son of a bitch. There's no one like him. I... I didn't... I really mean that. Well, one down. They all come out to see our headliner. He used to be big. Direct from doing a duet with a dog. This guy's going places, mostly down. Ladies and gentlemen, Frank Sinatra! Last time you're gonna see him work in Vegas. Where's the dog? Where's your wife? Where is your fucking wife? Oh damn it, break open some windows, get some air in here! Wake up, Frank. Frank, wake up. Get him on his feet. - Get up. Get up. - Up, up, up. We need to call an ambulance? No calls. No calls. No ambulance, no cops. Listen, we gotta call the studio. He's in no shape to do anything. After stalling them all night, they'll never record him again. Frank, Frank! Stand up, come on. Stand up. Atta boy. - Frank! - Yeah, yeah. - There you go. - He's coming through. Breathe, breathe, come on. Yeah. - Ava. - Forget her. Forget Ava. She is with Artie. Frank, she's not with... look at me, she's not with Artie. Hank checked it out. She's not with Artie. I knocked on the door. She ain't there. She ain't gonna be there. He got the message, that know-it-all prick. Frank, you're supposed to be at the studio, not doing this. A billion broads in the world and you picked the one that can take you or leave you whenever she wants. Oh, he's got it bad. And the boy's been waiting at the studio for him all night. Put on a pot of coffee, we're taking you for a walk. Let's go. We ought to call or something. - Come on. - Just walk with us. Let's go. Frank. - What do you got? - Show him. From Billy Roche's shop. On the arm, of course. - They match her eyes. - Mm-hmm. They're not cheap. No vig for six months, but Frank... Never mind that. Got the other thing? Okay. She's gonna love this. It sings too. They're stunning. Where'd you get the money to afford them, for God's sakes? Now what kind of question is that? I'm a nosy broad. You know that. I mean they're real, aren't they? Ey! Nothing fake for my girl. Come here! You like your present? No, I hate it. You didn't have to. I'm just happy being your wife. Mrs. Sinatra. Mr. Sin-atra. I love you, Francis. All I ever wanted in the world was to be a singer. Now you're all I want. So, Harry, are you sure there isn't anything in your little old war picture for me? I'm sure you recall the performance I gave the last time we worked together. Yes Mercedes, you did good. Minna, get me Sinatra on the line and then give me Eli Wallach. Well, I did a little more than good. You might have a point, Mercedes. Darling, I have some delicate calls to make. I'll tell you what. We'll read the script together over lunch and see what we come up with, okay? Oh I know we can come up with something, Harry. Bye now. Another broad with balls. I got Mr. Wallach on the line for you. Frank! - Hello? - Frankie baby! Maggio was the last part we cast. It was between you and Eli Wallach. He's one hell of an actor. He tested great. That crowd Zinnemann just plotzed when he saw the reel. I understand. I appreciate getting the shot. Thank me later. Look, he doesn't look Italian. He looks like a Hebe. So, we're going with you. We're going with you, you big putz! You hear me, boy? Check, you got the part. Get your tush over to Hawaii and start marching. You're in the army now, son. That was Harry. Better pour us a drink. Oh, baby! Sure thing! Better make it champagne. Champagne? I'm so happy for you. You got it. You got it! I got to go to Hawaii and learn how to march.

Morning, day and night, no answer. I'm at the end of my rope. Take it easy, Frank. She's probably just rehearsing. She had dinner with Bogie just the other night. I heard she spent the weekend in Spain with Picasso and Hemingway. You know what Frank, that Picasso can paint some really groovy paintings, man. And I mean that, baby. Who else was she with? Uh... Girl, can I get some Chiclets? Frank, you got to stop trying to reach her. It's driving you crazy. You got to concentrate and focus. How is Monty Clift, by the way? I heard he trained like a fanatic for the role, even got you to rehearse. Zinnemann worships the ground he walks on. I never met a more powerful actor.

What matters to me is what he gives me on set. I mean we work on every scene, every beat, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I mean he's taking me to a whole other level. Who knows? Maybe you'll win an Academy Award. Oh darling, Frank winning an Oscar! Oh, speak of the devil. Howard, how are you darling? Well, look who we have here, Howard. I want to get a chair Arte and sit down, okay? You mind? Thank you. Lovely, lovely. Here we are, the swooner, unhealthy, wartime finale. Yesterday's news, right? Yes, the war is over in Korea. Well, what would a draft dodger know about a war? You're a cookie full of arsenic, aren't you, Lee? Well, I take that as a compliment, Frank. Howard, why don't you take your new friend over to the bar and get a drink on me? I didn't come here to have you buy me a drink. I was hoping to see Ava. So where is our little kitten, Frank? Why don't you take a long walk off a short pier, you right-wing creep you? Howard, why don't you take it easy on my friend here? Wait, she isn't here, is she? She's over in Italy. Or is it Spain? Let's leave the sword play to Errol Flynn, shall we? Would you like me to make you a movie star, little girl? Yes, Mr. Hughes! Make me a big movie star like Ava Gardner. You see, Frank, I could just make another one but that little Tar Heel got under your skin. Why I... you are the... Besides, you don't need her. You have Montgomery Clift. Hold on a second, Howard, my... my listeners want to know... That son of a bitch called me a queer. Frank, if the shoe fits... Hey, lay off, Lee. I'm exhausted. I must go wash the stench off. Why don't you just beat it, pal? Frank, you know what I'd like to do? I'd like to take a picture. Would that be all right? Waiter, come on over here and you know what I want you to do? I want to get Frank a bowl of spaghetti. I want to... I want to see you eat the spaghetti, Frank. They got nice little Dago wop that you are. You rat... Let me go. Let me go. God damn it! Fucker! Operator, what's the problem? I'm trying to reach this number for days. Pavely. Well, how do I know? It's someplace outside of Rome. It's United Artists. How can the phones be out of order? It's a fucking movie studio. Well, watch my language? How about this?. Of all the gin joints in all the world, she goes walking into mine. Bravo, Frank, Bravo! Bogie owns that but yours had more soul. Just words on the page, Monty. Words on the page. Without soul, they mean nothing, Frank. A character's soul is more important than the words he speaks. I'll drink to that. It's all about behavior. What goes on behind the eyes. Well tell me something, professor. What's going on behind these eyes? I know, Frank. I know. Your marriage is falling apart, the whole world is crashing down on you, it's beating you to death. That's Maggio, Frank. Just use it. Use all of it. It's okay. They're gonna send me to the stockade, Prew? No, they ain't gonna take you to the stockade. Watch out for Fatso. Watch out for Fatso. He'll try to crack ya. And if they put ya in a hole, don't yell. Don't make a sound. You'll still be yellin' when they come to get ya out. Just lay there. Just lay there. And be quiet, Prew. Hello! Yeah operator, I'll accept the charges. Hello, Ava! Ava? A bullfighter? What's his name, damn it? Luis Miguel Dominguin, the most famous bullfighter in Spain. I suppose he fucks like a jackrabbit, huh? There's no rhyme or reason to an affair, you know that. I suppose when it's all over you'll come back to me, huh? Do you want to come back? Olé! Oh come on, tiger! You've treated lots of women like dirt. It's your turn now. Olé! Well, what about love? Olé! My pals were right about you. There's a cruelness deep inside no one can ever reach... Your drink, madam. Gracias. I'm through with you, you hear me? You're staring into a looking glass, Francis. You're seeing your own reflection. Olé! Snake eyes. Story of my life. The crooner admitted that he had bruised and scratched his wrist but laughed off as gossip the rumors he had attempted suicide. The tempestuous singer, who recently reached the parting of ways with Ava Gardner, said he did not remember when or where the accident occurred. Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner stated today that having reluctantly exhausted every effort to reconcile their differences, can find no mutual basis on which to continue their marriage.

Why don't you just write it how you sees it? That's what you guys do anyway. Aren't you here against doctor's orders, Frank? What do doctors know, right, Frank? Anything? Sorry chief. Keep your chin up, Frank. She'll be back. They always come back, you know that. Hurricane Ava? I'm sure she wouldn't want you to hurt the other wrist. What are you, a stunod, huh? Frank cut his hand trying to open a window. End of story. What's a stunod? It means you got a big mouth. And one of these days, somebody's going to shut it for you. Capisce? I'll take that under advisement. Listen Frank, tell me the truth. Who was it this time? Hughes? Hemmingway? Maybe another bullfighter? Now why you got to come up to this man and say a thing like that? Easy champ, easy. As a torero you need more than a cape and fancy footwork to escape Ava Gardner, isn't that right, Frank? Why don't you button it up huh, Walter? Yeah, I'll button it up. I'll button it up if you face the music. We all know who wears the pants, who pays the rent, but she is not here. Enough of your bullshit. Joe, get him out of here. Mr. Winchell, you're going to force me to make a comeback. Hey wait, don't put your hands on me. Come on, get him out of here. Oh wait, Frank, Frank, good luck at the Oscars. I hear they're even putting it on television. Isn't that something? First time. Why do you even talk to that creep? Remember Lucky? He talked to him. You know what he got? The chair. The chair, that's what he got. It hurts, Hank, 'cause I got a big hole right here. I just can't hide it anymore. Then don't hide it. Use the pain. Sing from there. Happy songs are bullshit anyway. Go ahead! Go kill 'em! ♪ So if your man is nice You better take my advice ♪ ♪ Hug him in the morning Kiss him at night ♪ ♪ Give him plenty lovin', girl Treat your man right ♪ ♪ 'Cause a good man ♪ ♪ Yeah, a good man ♪ ♪ Nowadays is hard to find ♪ What's the matter? Doesn't the wasp cook for you? Nancy, please, huh? Make me a few ravioli. Don't they feed you at the Academy Awards? I know, Frankie misses home cooking. So, you're nervous? Me? Nah. I'm just happy to be there. You know, they nominated a lot of heavyweights: Bill Holden, Audrey Hepburn, Monty Clift. So, what about your African Queen? Isn't she nominated? Oh wait! The paper says she's not coming. What was it? Bullfighting. Cliché. Now don't overcook the ravioli, will you? You're going to make a mess of yourself. When are you going to learn? Your kids are here. Hey! Angel. See how nice daddy looks for the Academy Awards? Are you going to win an Academy Award? Not so fast, cupcake. Mommy thinks you are. The terror of Gimbels' basement. Seven, seven.

Oh, yeah? Could sure use a nightcap. Yeah never mind that. What do you think you're doing out here? She's gone. No show. Who... who's gone? Who are you talking about? The girl, you know. Can't stay together, can't stay apart. You know how that works, don't you pal? No, what I know is that you're drunk.

Would you believe little old me? Oh yeah, how does a fellow like you get a hold of a thing like that huh? Behavior. It's what goes on behind the eyes. What do you got, Josenhans? He's a vagrant, publicly intoxicated, possibly stolen goods. What do you got here? Who is he calling a vagrant? Congratulations! You had a great night tonight, huh? Come on, pal.

It's Frank Sinatra. - The singer? - Yeah! - What, that guy? - Yeah, the actor. No kidding. Yeah he just won the Academy Award. It was on television and everything. You didn't see it? No. He kept talking about some girl. Yeah. If you've been in this job as long as I have, you always find that there's a girl at the end of the story. Especially with a guy like that. Frank Sinatra. I'm... I'm terribly pleased and if I start thanking everybody, I'll do a one reeler up here so I better not. And I'd just like to say, however, that they're doing a lot of songs here tonight but nobody asked me. I love you though. Thank you very much. I'm absolutely thrilled. Okay, boys, let's make a record. One, two, three, four. Yeah, baby! He's still got it. Yeah he's got it. Yeah, go with it, Frank. Howard Hughes really used his influence to turn the press against Frank Sinatra. Ava Gardner had a sense of irony. She was very intelligent. And in her own way, she was very principled. She never said she was a nun. And she was very, very much her own person. You know, she was not one of these people who said a man can run my life. That was not who she was. Frank wanted to run her life. I knew Ava Gardner well like a lot of people knew her well. I wasn't the only one, many people knew her well. She was out and about and around and making it here and making it there. The only time I ever really, really, really saw Frank happy was when he was on stage. He was an amazing singer, no question about it. And he turned out to be a pretty good actor too. Everything that he ever did, I watched. Every album he ever made, I had. I adored his voice and adored him. And I mean after all he was Frank Sinatra. I mean there was nobody bigger or more charming and those blue eyes and that smile. I'm ninety-three years old and I can still smell Ava Gardner's perfume. ♪ Please stay Where are you going? ♪ ♪ I haven't started yet ♪ ♪ You haven't stopped me yet ♪ ♪ And you know That's alright with me ♪ ♪ Follow your beautiful stare ♪ ♪ Cinder blocks in cold hotels ♪ ♪ Where feigning hearts Meet empty stairwells ♪ ♪ And out the fire escape ♪ ♪ Escape ♪ ♪ I don't give a damn If it's weak or strong ♪ ♪ I know I want you ♪ ♪ And I know you want me too ♪ ♪ So, I take all I can get ♪ ♪ I'll beg and weep for it ♪ ♪ Crawl on my two hands ♪ ♪ Get up and convince You again ♪ ♪ That I don't even Know you yet ♪ ♪ Yet ♪ ♪ Please say You're thinking of me ♪ ♪ Taken hearts In tangled sheets ♪ ♪ You're the shrouded Missing piece ♪ ♪ That sets the spark aflame ♪ ♪ Aflame ♪ ♪ I don't give a damn If it's weak or strong ♪ ♪ I know I want you ♪ ♪ And I know you want me too ♪ ♪ So I take all I can get ♪ ♪ I take all I can get ♪ ♪ I'll beg and weep for it ♪ ♪ Crawl on my two hands ♪ ♪ Get up and convince You again ♪ ♪ That I don't even Know you yet ♪ ♪ Yet ♪ ♪ Yet ♪ ♪ It's written in the daylight ♪ ♪ A message in the sunshine ♪ ♪ And I can't wait Until tonight ♪ ♪ Tonight ♪ ♪ And I don't give a damn If it's weak or strong ♪ ♪ I know I want you ♪ ♪ And I know you want me too ♪ ♪ So, I take all I can get ♪ ♪ No, I take all I can get ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I'll beg and weep for it ♪ ♪ Crawl on my two hands ♪ ♪ Get up and convince You again ♪ ♪ That I don't even Know you yet ♪ ♪ Yet ♪ ♪ Yet ♪ ♪ I don't even know you yet ♪ Yeah, he's alright.
