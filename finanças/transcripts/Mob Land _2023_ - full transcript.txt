Dead of winter, cold as all hell. A man hails a cab, he slides in, sits in the warmth in the back seat. A few miles down the road, cab hits a sheet of black ice, starts spinning outta control, heading towards the edge of the bridge, nothing but blackness below. Driver screams, "We're all gonna die!" The man calmly leans forward and softly says, "Could you turn the radio up?" I don't get it, which one are you? The driver or the guy in the back? Both. Hey, hey! Uh! We may all be sliding towards the edge, but it's up to you how comfortable you are doing it. Pay your debts, friend. Oh, hell. Hey. How's it going? Good, yeah, getting there. Need you back on 32 tomorrow, once you get this buttoned up. Okay, yeah. Think you can handle two of Jim's shifts next week? Well, hell yeah. Good, 'cause he'll need to take the week off, the kid died. What? Shit, Caleb? Well, he's gonna take the week, funeral and all. Yeah, yeah. Damn, what the hell happened? Overdose, fucking pills or whatever else. It's a shame too, he was a good kid, he used to be, I don't know. Yeah. I gotta. Thanks, Mike. Yep. I still don't get why it's gotta be so loud. Well, 'cause loud is fast. So how come you race and Mama doesn't? Well, baby girl, 'cause your Mama's smart. And you're what? Well, I'm tough and strong. And Mama's not strong? Oh, geez, girl. Look, sometimes it's not about, you know, how much you can lift, right, but about how much weight you can carry, that makes you strong, you know what that means? Maybe. You know those, ah, those big, old trees we learned about out there in California, ones so big you can drive a car right through them? Yeah. You know how those trees survived for thousands of years, right, just standing there and then one day, a skinny, little man, your height, maybe even smaller than you comes along, right, with a little ax, a few hours, he cuts that big, old tree down. She's a skinny man? No, baby girl, the ax, right, she might be small, but damn, she can cut that big old tree down. She doesn't need to race to prove she's tough. She doesn't even need to cut down a big, old tree, you know, like the ax, right? You can just take one look at her, realize what she's capable of, that's your Mama. Daddy says you're an ax. Hey. What, like an old battle ax? No, not an ax, I meant like a, a shiny, you know, slender blade. Boy, I can cut you down to size. Yeah, ain't that the truth? Get me in trouble. Trey's stopping by. Oh great, well, he can slide under there and help me swap that, that rear end. Oh well, good luck, that boy doesn't know a monkey wrench from his asshole. Mama! Hey, come on, help me with dinner. But I'm helping Dad. Come on, he can clean up his own mess. Let's go. Thanks for nothing. Damn, never miss home cooked meals, until I get them. Doesn't beer count as home cooked if you live at a bar? [laughing] I live above a bar, cut me some slack. No, seriously though, that was delicious. Not as good as your mom's, but pretty decent. Oh, shit, damn. You knew. Well, I didn't know if you'd come otherwise. Well, I wouldn't have. Oh yeah, I know. Oh, hey there, Uncle Bodie. Hey, Shelby, how's my favorite driver? Good, good. What do you know, Trey? Just here for the food, same as you. Oh, I'm guilty. You take care of that ticket? It's in the mail, Sheriff. Aren't they all? How you holding up, Sheriff? I'm still standing. Oh-oh! Oh, oh, no, no, no, my heart, my heart is racing. Are you the most beautiful princess in the world? Mr. Bodie, Mama got you a plate. Plate? I ain't here for no plate. I'm here on official police business. Yeah, I bet, like every week. What? I am. Come on. Ah, you're too good to me, thank you. We missed you at service Sunday. Yeah, you know, I don't know about that new preacher. Call me old fashioned, but I'm kind of more of a, I don't know, fire and brimstone type of guy, you know? Yeah, I hear that. Well, I hate to grab a plate and run, but I think y'all don't really watch me eat. Goodnight, Sheriff. Take care now. You too. All right, little lady, bedtime. Oh! No, no. Night, Daddy. Sweet dreams, beauty, I love you. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, come on! Night, booger. Goodnight, little booger. [laughing] Come on. Hey, Earnhardt. Thank you. How long you gonna do this for? I don't know, as long as it takes. Fine anyway, these are doing the trick. It killed Muhammad Ali, this shit ain't no joke. And you think I don't know that, Trey? What the hell you want me to do, man? Let me just get our heads above water, then we can deal with me, all right? You can't get shit by her, you know that, you never could. Think I like keeping secrets from her, Trey? Just give me some fucking room, huh? Your funeral. Come grab this side. Now? We just, we just ate. Now, fucker, let's go! All right, all right, all right. Oh, man. ♪ Blood on the highway ♪ Gonna get my gun ♪ War, it ain't over ♪ Till all the killing's done Trey. What you doing here? Let's go for a ride. I don't know, man, Caroline's gonna be home in a few minutes. Come on, I wanna show you something. Now, I know you don't like to be seen in an import, but get in. What's going on, Trey? Ain't nothing going on, just take a fucking ride with me. 30 minutes, I'll have you home. Yeah, all right, all right. If I wake up in Mexico with no pants on, Caroline's gonna cut your nuts off. [laughing] Your pants will stay on, I promise. They'd better. Unless you're feeling frisky. Hey, buy me an Oreo shake and we'll talk. Done. Fucking seat belts and everything, man, I can't believe I'm in this thing. Fuck off. Been here, what, 20 years, still driving this piece of shit? Tokyo Green, Hulk here is unbeatable. Oh my God, Trey, fucking embarrassing, man. I can't be seen in this piece of shit, Christ. Whoo, listen to that purr. That's what I'm talking about right there, bro. Whoo! Don't kill us Trey, Jesus. What, man, what is this? That. What you working on your black belt? Nope. Okay, so what is it? 100 K, cash at least. What is? What do you know about Oxy? I don't know shit about Oxy, Trey, nothing, man, don't need to, get me outta here. There's a doc in there, some bullshit hack. People come in, "This hurts and that hurts," and Doc will write out a script for them, hundreds of them every day. Okay, what the hell's that got to do with me? And now these yokels, they go and fulfill those scripts and guess what? They come right back here. Those pills go in and out that back door and sold all over the county. [sighing] Man, I don't fucking care, right, take me home. And once they sell those pills, they bring that cash right back here, hundreds and thousands of dollars running through this piece of shit right here every week and nothing but a couple of backwood inbreds running it. Trey, are you fucking kidding me? Nope. Are you suggesting that we stroll in there and we take that money? [sighing] We can, we can. Man, that's a stupid fucking idea. Never ever seen more than one or two tweakers in there guarding that place. It ain't rocket science. Well, that's for damn sure. Shel, they're killing people with this shit, you've seen it. I know. We all have, this town is dying and these fuckers are getting rich from it. That's your cash in there, that's our cash, we put our blood, sweat and tears into this town and they're just taking it all from us. This whole place is becoming a fucking cliche. First the factories fold, then no jobs, no hope and then these leeches, they come in, they suck what's left off the bottom. I'm sick of it, Shel, I'm sick of it. And I don't wanna see Mila left in the mud either. Hey, this is easy money, Shel. Don't talk to me about this shit again, you hear? Don't tell me someone else died, I can't handle that shit right now. Hop in, catch some of this AC. What's going on? Jim needs those shifts back. Damn, okay. I'll pay for the funeral. Yeah, I get it. Oh, shit, that ain't all, man. Shit, Mike. Well, hey there, Shelby. How we doing today, sugar? I'm hanging in, Ms. Whitney, what about yourself? Well, I'm still upright, praise Jesus. Yes, ma'am, I hear that. [sighing] Early this month, huh? Yeah. Oh, damn it, I'm so sorry. I appreciate that, Ms. Whitney. You know what? Hm? Might as well have that too. All righty. You want your balance receipt? Oh, hell, couldn't pay for the ink anyway. Love to the girls. Appreciate that, Ms. Whitney. Take care. Bye. I don't know, man, guns and drugs, that shit ain't me. No, it ain't. That's why you leave that shit to me. You just drive the car and watch my back, you don't even need to touch a gun, I promise. Look, I know these dudes, we're not talking "Goodfellas" here, we're talking a couple slack jaws with pill problems. Girls are going to Tupelo this weekend. Looky there. Wish you were coming. Shit, no, you don't. You love that big, old guest bed all to yourself. Stay up late watching those God awful dating shows. You gonna be good here? Of course. Well, good, 'cause I do love that bed. Hey, you know what, why don't you take a couple hundred and get that old bluff from Kenny? You know, keep going a few more weekends, I mean, you said Mike gave you those shifts. Oh baby, I told you, I can't fix it with what we got, stays broke. Damn, I love you. What are y'all talking about? Little girls not finishing packing and getting left behind. You have three minutes or this train's leaving with or without you. I just need someone to sit on it while I zip. Okay, I'll be up in a few minutes. Well, I'm leaving in three. Oh, boy, she is definitely your daughter. Open it. What the hell's this? Open it. Damn, you are too much. Mom. Daughter's calling you. Hm, hm-hm, she's definitely yours. Yeah, this will do. Where'd you find it? Don't you worry about that. Jesus Christ, Trey. Color's ugly as shit, but it's a turbo just like you asked for. Yeah, what about the plates? I took care of it. I do love a turbo V6. Look at Shelby Conners all excited about a stolen vehicle. You little criminal. Hey! This isn't New York, all right, this is my own backyard, man. Act like you understand we're breaking the law. Act like you understand what's at stake here. Hey, she's my niece, I fucking understand what's at stake. I'm not the one we gotta worry about. Let's just get this over with. Mr. Bodie. That ain't good. I'll get with the oncologist in Birmingham, but in the meantime, you go home, enjoy your day. We'll take this one step at a time. Man. ♪ Oh oh ♪ Oh oh oh oh When we get in there, you just watch my back, that's it. Okay, we'll be fine as long as you watch my back. Here. What the fuck is this, Trey? You said I wouldn't need this.

Y'all know whose money this is, you have any fucking idea whose money this is? Shut the fuck up, shut up! Are you okay? Don't look at me, don't fucking look at me.

Yes, you did, yes, you did! Yeah, we got the money, God knows how much and yeah, we got a shit load of pills too. I'm sorry, you thought you were gonna be halfway in. He said he knew you, Trey. Did he, do you know those guys? It doesn't matter now. We just need to to lay low for a little bit, keep our heads down, all right. Oh, you're taking it? You want it? Here, take it, go on, it's yours. It's called trust, bro. Just keep it safe, hide it your toolbox or something, keep it away from the girls. We fucking killed them, Trey. Yeah, we did, we killed them. The way I see it, it was us or them and I'd fucking do it again if I had to. We're family, bro, that shit back there, that was nothing but taking care of family. Come on. Come here, come here. Let's go home. We got a 9-0-4 on Old Fence Road off 58.

All right, well, well, we just wait for Ms. Whitney's story, I guess. But I tell you what it's gonna be about, it's gonna be about pills and money and cussing. Two men, shotgun and a pistol. Yeah, well, the pistol did that and the wood furniture done that guy in. And he ain't here. No, he isn't. Whiskey in them cups. And that arm is junkies robbing junkies just like the two guys from the highway. Man, this is as crooked as the Chattahoochee. Well, all right, call me if anything turns up. Oh. That's it?

You see the statement from the doc and Ms. Whitney? Is that it on your seat? Then how did I see it? Well, the doc wants immunity. Is that right? Yeah.

Get down. Give me your hands. I don't fucking know you. No, sir. So what do you want? Well, I heard y'all thought it was a good idea to steal from the Nola folk, said y'all thought we were all a bunch of stupid cunts, wouldn't do shit about it, that true? I don't know what that means, none of it.

Fucking stop, fuck! 2292 Kent Street, Tupelo, Mississippi. Yeah, he gave that up too. They got nothing to do with this. They do now. You try to leave town, cops, whatever, my man in Tupelo gets rambunctious, you understand me? I'll be in touch. Is that a tulip tree or a dogwood? Huh? Morning, Shel. Hi, Uncle Bodie. What you doing out around these parts? Hell you been, boy? Oh, I got a couple of hog traps out at the end of 5-79, weir been rising a little, I guess, they've all been underwater now, just had to move them a little higher. Well, better you than me, I'd just as soon shoot them. Anyway, I'm here looking for Trey. Hm, yeah? Yeah, you seen him, heard from him? No, no, not in a couple of days, I guess. You know, Caroline's back with her folks, so he, ah, he hasn't been around. Okay. Why, what's going on? Oh, probably nothing, I got a call early this morning from the High Bar, they were complaining about noise and whatnot and I gotta check it out, 'cause if a bar is complaining about noise from an apartment upstairs, But as I said, it's probably nothing, you know Trey. Yeah, I do. Yeah. So what happened here? Just locked myself out. Hm, and when you broke the glass, it went this way? Caroline took Mila to her folks up in Tupelo for a few days, we, ah, we got into it the other night, threw a damn beer through the window. That's why she left, you know, it's all just getting to us, you know, just everything. Yeah, I do know, I was married for 38 years, but I'd get this cleaned up before Mila comes back, those little feet, oh, you know, that's my princess. Yes, sir, will do. All right, let me know if Trey turns up and good luck tonight. Thank you. Oh, does Trey still drive that, that Jap thing? Yes, sir, he does, can't get him to go American quite just yet. All right, take care. Yeah, you too. All right. Pack of Camels. Ah, there you go. That's eight even. Thank you. There you go. Say, what do y'all do in this town? Pardon me? Oh, no disrespect, old timer, but what do people do here? Like for fun? People have fun here? [laughing] Well, sure, I mean, we got the track on Monday nights and hunting and football in the fall, I guess. So between shooting squirrels and high school football, people just kind of meander around waiting to die? I, I guess. No, that, that ain't right. You grow up around here? About a mile that a way. When you were growing up, you always wanted to run the local gas station? Oh, you know, my daddy ran the station down there on old 24, I guess I just followed suit. Here you are, huh?

What, here? Not here, but close, they're safe. Oh, shit. Stay cool, Shel. Hey, Sheriff. Shelby. I don't believe I know you. This here's my new sponsor over from New Orleans. Fred Ellsworth, Ellsworth Construction. Nola, huh? Most of the time, I'm opening up a small shop down these parts and recognize the power of local marketing through this here young talent. Tax trip, huh? Hm. Hm What you got there going on? Oh, yeah, I nicked it on, ah, I nicked it on, on the door getting out of this old car, just clumsy is all. All right, so what is this, a early morning meeting? [laughing] Hog hunting. Really now? That's right, "Showing this city slicker how it's done," he said, so. In those? Oh, God, I hope not, I mean, these are, these are way too expensive to get dirty. No, I won't do that to you, I got some mucks for him. Oh, good. You're welcome to join if you'd like, Sheriff. Oh, no, Shelby here uses a bow, that's a young man's game, too much running around for me. I like, I like to keep a distance, you know? So they don't see me coming. Well, now I know what I'm in for. Yeah, you do. So Caroline, Mila, they're still back in Tupelo way or what's going on? Yes, sir, yeah, through the week, I reckon. Ah-huh. You know, Mila just, ah, just loves that little house there on Kent Street. Shelby, talk to you. Yeah, you guys get it. You seen Trey? Oh, no, not since last week when he was here. Mm-hm. We found his car. No shit? No shit, Firestone Factory all banged up. Hell. Mm-hm. Not considered missing, is he? You okay? Yeah, just getting ready to get out there. You wanna tell me something? Anything? Go ahead, go ahead. That robbery at the clinic a few days ago. Mm-hm. I, ah, I think that was Trey. You do now? Yeah and then the murder of the, ah, the doctor I heard about last night, yeah, I think maybe Trey's trying to, I don't know, clean up. Hm, well. I'm real worried about him, Uncle Bodie. Yeah, it was more than 100 K, that could change a man's life, could ruin it. You telling the truth? All right, now you, you tell me if you run into Trey. Will do. Now what's your name again? Fred. Fred, it's a pleasure. Nice meeting you, Sheriff. Now you be careful of them hogs there. They're ugly bastards and they'll get your goose and they'll put a tusk right straight through you, like it was nothing, leave you out there on the field bleeding. Jesus. Thanks for the warning. All right, well, get after it, yep. See you, Sheriff. Get on the horn to Tupelo PD, get me an APB on Caroline and Mila Conners. Get Caroline's maiden name and Kent Street, that's all I got. Ben, do it now. 10-4, Bodie. I'll see you at the office. What did you have to say over there? Just looking for the guy you killed with the trash bag is all. And where is he? Gone. It's almost that time, take me to my car. You gonna stab me or slit my throat? Maybe both. Who's the battle ax? The one who taught me it's not how hard you swing it, but how sharp it is. So let me get this straight, small town race car driver with Parkinson's struggles to make ends meet for his wife and his little daughter. Goddamn! We all play the hand we're dealt, I guess. And you're still going, still fighting the good fight left in you. That's what we do. Who's we? Us, all of us, I don't fucking know. Not all of us. What the fuck do you care? Huh? Fuck, man, after last night, after this whole damn week, you wanna just keep shitting on me? You killed my wife's brother, you made me kill that woman. I took money from the wrong fucking people, I get it, Jesus Christ. Look, I'm doing everything you say. I'm just trying to get my fucking life back, whatever life I got left. We're all going in the same direction. Even you? Oh, I know I am. That's the difference between me and people in places like this, oblivious. Yeah, you keep talking about how it's all meaningless. You just do that to justify the horrible shit you do. There's a world where all this has meaning, it's this one. You don't have to be alone. Here at Healy Family Funeral Home, we will be by your side as you navigate this special time with quality, affordable services and headstones, we offer a variety of packages. Christ, you can count on that, huh? When your business is death in a town like this, business is booming, half off headstones. When people are killing themselves for pennies and then taking them for some rocks to put over your rotting body. Or call us, 4249. When my folks died, they didn't have two of those pennies to rub together. It took me years to save up to replace that shitty, wooden gravestone the church donated. And what was the point? That we should all be so lucky, just to have a proper place to rest, when this is all said and done, something that says, "Hey, we were here." Hm. I was nine years old, I came home from school and I found my dad dead on the kitchen floor. Blew his head off with a shotgun, not before putting two shells into my mom, while she was in the bath. Shit, coroner took them, I watched, no clue where to. Some distant relative probably thought it was best for everyone that they burned them and tossed the ashes. I don't know. Where are they? They're safe. I told you, you got my word on that. So this is him, huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this, huh? He doesn't know? Know what? Well, go on. No, no, I did everything you asked, all of it. You did. You said you don't kill the innocent, you said that. I saw you kill that woman, Shel, I watched you do it. Fuck!
