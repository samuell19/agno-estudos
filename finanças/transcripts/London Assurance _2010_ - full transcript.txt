[sil.] Nearly half-past nine, and Mr Charles has not yet returned, I am in the fever of dread. If his father happens to rise earlier than usual, he is sure to ask first for Mr Charles. Poor deluded old gentleman, he little thinks how he is deceived. [music] Mr. Cool. Well, Martin, he has not come home yet? No, and I have not had a wink of sleep all night. I can't stand this any longer, I shall hand him a notice. This is the fifth night Mr. Courtly has remained out, and I am obliged to stand at the hall window to watch for him. You know if Sir Harcourt is aware that we connived at his son's irregularities, we should all be discharged. I have used up all the usual excuses on his creditors. "Call again," "Not at home," and "Send it down to you," won't serve any more, and Mr. Crust, the wine-merchant, swears he will be paid. So they all say. Why, he has a warrant out against him already. I've seen the fellows watching the door, there he is, just in time, quick, Martin, for I expect Sir Harcourt's bell any moment, and there it is. Thank heaven! Mr. Charles will return to college tomorrow, and his heavy responsibility will be taken of my shoulders. A valet is as difficult a post to fill properly as that of prime minister. Hollo! Steady. Hollo! Hush! What are you about, howling like a Hottentot. Well, here we go. Now sit down there, and thank heaven you are in Belgrave Square, instead of Bow Street. Oh, damn Bow Street. Oh, with all my heart! You have not seen as much of it as I have. I say, let me see, what was I going to say? Oh, yes, yes, yes, look here. There! dam'me! Well, this… this will puzzle that damned postmen, I'll… I'll… I'll deprive them of his right of disturbing the neighborhood. See, this lion's head belongs to that old Vampire, the money-lender, this bell-pull to Miss Stitch, the milliner. And this brass griffin? Oh, let me see, oh, yes, I… I think, I twisted that off our own hall-door as I came in, while you were paying the cab. What shall I do with them? Be kind to 'em. Oh, oh, pack… pack 'em in a small hamper, and… and send them to the Bow Street magistrate with my father's compliments, in the meantime… in the meantime come into my room and I'll astonish you with some Burgundy. Mr. Charles. Out! Out! Not at home to anyone. And drunk. As a lord. If Sir Harcourt knew this, he would go mad, he would discharge me. You flatter yourself, that would be no proof of his insanity. This is Cool, sir, Mr. Cool, he… he… he is the best liar in London, there… there is a pungency about his invention, and an originality in his equivocation, that is perfectly refreshing. All right. Why, Mr. Charles, where did you pick him up? You mistake, he picked me up and carried me. He's coming down. Here comes Sir Harcourt, use the backstairs, pray do not let him see you in this state. State! What do you mean state? I am in a beautiful state. I should lose my character. That would be a fortunate epoch in your life, Cool. Your father would discharge me. How dare you get drunk, pal? Retire to your own room, for heaven's sake, Mr. Charles. Well, I'll… I'll do so for my own sake. I… I… I say, dear fellow, just… just hold that door steady while… while I go in. Yeah, I've got it. Take care! Light up. [sil.] Cool, is breakfast ready? Quite ready. Sir Harcourt. Apropos. I Omitted to mention that I expect Squire Harkaway to join us this morning, and you must prepare for my departure to his house in Gloucestershire immediately. Leave town in the middle of the season, Sir Harcourt? So unprecedented a proceeding! It is. I confess it, there is but one power could effect such a miracle, that is divinity. Your own or someone else's? A female, Cool. I am about to present society with a second Lady Courtly Gay, blushing, eighteen. Eighteen? Eighteen. Eighteen? Eighteen. Eighteen? Eighteen. Lovely! I have her portrait, rich! I have her banker's account, an heiress, and a Venus! Lady Courtly could be none other. Ha! ha! Cool, your manners are above your station. Apropos, I shall find no further use for my brocaded dressing-gown. I thank you, Sir Harcourt. Might I ask who the fortunate Lady is? Certainly, Miss Grace Harkaway, the niece of my old friend, Max. And you have met the lady, sir? I've introduced her eight years ago. When she was already 10. You do not approve of her relative youth. On the contrary there could be no fault with her youth sir. Love is the demand of the young. Shakespeare's Juliet was 13. How old was Romeo? Fifty-seven. Oh, don't talk. Cool as you know the imperative of my (inaudible) driven me against my wishes to live on the continent for the last seven years. Consequently, I've not the opportunity of paying my devoirs. Oh, no, no, no, nothing to compromised this slender figure. But I do confess that our betrothal was a very extraordinary one. Her father's estates were contiguous to mine, being a penurious miserly, ugly old scoundrel, he made a market of my indiscretion, and supplied my extravagance with large sums of money on mortgages, his great desire being to unite the two properties. About seven years ago, he died leaving Grace, his only child to the guardianship of her uncle, but with this remarkable will, if on attaining the age of 19, she would consent to marry me, I should receive the deeds to my own estate, and all his property, as her dowry. If she refused to comply with this condition, they should revert to my heir-apparent or presumptive. She consents. Who would not? And I consent to receive her £15,000 a year. Who would not? So prepare. Cool, prepare! Where's my boy, where is Charles? He rose early Sir Harcourt, and, he's gone out to take a walk. Poor child! A perfect child in heart a sober, placid mind, kept fresh and unsullied by any contact with society. Tell me. Cool, at what time was he in bed? Half-past nine, Sir Harcourt. It's half-past nine! It's beautiful! What an original idea! [sil.] Reposing in cherub slumbers, while all around him teems with drunken and debauchery! No skirmishes with sailors. No bear-skinned brawling! Oh, Sir Harcourt! No cigar smoking. Faints at the sight of one. No brandy and water bibbing. Never tasted anything stronger than barley-water. Never heard the dock strike twelve, except at noon. Mr Harkaway! Squire Harkaway, fellow, or Max Harkaway, another time. One moment, Max. Ah! Ha! Sir Harcourt, I'm devilish glad to see ye! Dang it, but I'm glad to see ye! Let me see. Six-seven years or more, since we last met. How quickly time flies! You don't look a day old. Give me your fist! Give me your hand, Max, old boy. Yeah. He is glad to see me. There is no fawning pretence about that squeeze. Cool, you may retire. Why, you are looking quite rosy. Rosy! Am I too florid? Not a bit, not a bit. I thought not Cool said I had put too much on. How comes it. Courtly, that you manage to retain your youth? [sil.] See, I'm as grey as an old badger, or a wild rabbit, and you are as black as a young rook. I say, whose head grew your hair, eh? Permit me to remark that all the beauties of my person are of home manufacture. Why should you be surprised at my youth? I have scarcely thrown off the giddiness of a very boy, elasticity of limb, buoyancy of soul! Remark this position, I held that attitude for 10 minutes at Lady Acid's last reunion, at the express desire of one of our former sculptors, while he was making a sketch of me for his Apollo. Apollo, the God of lunch. Lady Sarah sarcasm started up, and pointing to my face, she ejaculated, "Good gracious! Does not Sir Harcourt remind you of the countenance of Ajax, in the Pompeian portrait?" Ajax! Humbug! You are complimentary. I'm a plain man, and always speak my mind. What's in a face or figure? Does a Grecian nose entail a good temper? Does a waspish waist indicate a good heart? Or, do oily perfumed locks necessarily thatch a well-furnished brain? It's an undeniable fact that plain people always praise the beauties of the mind. Excuse the insinuation, I had thought the first Lady Courtly had surfeited you with beauty. Oh, no, no, no. No, she lived 14 months with me, and then eloped with my best friend. And I miss him. [sil.] And yet you challenged him do a duo. It was imperative of etiquette match, so I received satisfaction with a bullet to the shoulder. However, I had the consolation of knowing that he was the handsomest man of the age. She did not insult me, by running away with a damned ill-looking scoundrel. That certainly was flattering. I felt so, as I pocketed the £10,000 damages. That must have been a great balm to your sore honor. Well, my honor would have died without it. It was one of the luckiest chances, a thing that does not happen twice in a man's life, the opportunity of getting rid of one's wife and one's debts at the same time. Tell the truth. Courtly ! Did you not feel a little frayed in your delicacy? Not a whit. So a man must therefore lose his wife and his reputation with a smile. In fact, everything he possesses, but his temper. Precisely, etiquette match, remember etiquette. Oh, damn etiquette. I have seen a man who considered it sacrilege to eat fish with a knife, that would not scruple to rise up and rob his brother of his birthright in a gambling-house. Pardon me, etiquette is the pulse of society, and I consider myself one of the faculty in the art. Well, well, you are a living libel upon common sense, for you are old enough to know better. Old enough! What do you mean? Old! I have not sown my wild oats yet. Time you did, at 57. Fifty-seven! Good gracious! Thirty-nine, for my life! Thirty-nine. Why, you are older than I am. Oh, you are old enough to be my father! Well, if I am, I am, that's etiquette, I suppose. Poor grace! How often I have pitied her fate! That a young and beautiful creature should be driven into wretched splendor or miserable poverty! Wretched! Lady Courtly wretched! Whatever. Impossible! Will she not be compelled to marry you, whether she likes you or not? A choice between you and poverty. And hang me if it isn't a tie! But why do you not introduce your son Charles to me? I have not seen him since he was a child. You know, he's not fit to enter society yet. He is a sober, studious boy. Boy! Why, he's five-and-twenty. For the heaven's sake, Max. You will allow me to know my own son's age, he is not twenty. I'm dumb. You will excuse me while I indulge in the process of dressing. Cool! Prepare my toilet. [sil.] This is a ceremony, which, with me, supersedes all others. I consider it a duty which every gentleman owes to society to render himself as agreeable an object as possible and the least compliment a mortal can pay to nature, when she honors him by bestowing extra care in the manufacture of his person, is to display her taste to the best possible advantage, and so, (inaudible). [sil.] That's a good soul, he has his faults, and who has not? Thirty-nine! Oh, monstrous! But he does look uncommonly young for nearly sixty, in spite of his foreign locks and complexion. Who's my friend, with the boots and gaiters, I wonder, one of the family, the governor maybe. Good morning. Oh, is that you, my boy? How are you? This is Charles, the boy. He knows me, but strange he doesn't look like a bailiff. How are you? Your father has just left me. The devil he has! He's been dead these ten years. Oh! I see, he thinks I'm Courtly. So the honor you would confer upon me, I must unwillingly disclaim, I am not Mr. Courtly. I beg pardon, a friend, I suppose. Oh, a most intimate friend, a friend of years, now I'm distantly related to the family, and one of my ancestors married one of his, Adam and Eve. Are you on a visit here? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Rather a short one though, I'm afraid. He's appearing a dashing kind of fellow and he's a friend of Sir Harcourt's. I'll invite him to the wedding. Sir, if you are not otherwise engaged, I shall feel honored by your company at my house, Oak Hall, Oldberry, Gloucestershire. And your name is? Harkaway. Max Harkaway. Harkaway, let me see, I think I might be related to the Harkaways', somehow. No. Yeah. There's about to be a wedding. Will you take a part on the occasion? Oh, with pleasure! Any part, but that of the husband. You have no previous engagement? Well, I promised to settle my account with my tailor tomorrow, or I'll just have to postpone that. Have you good shooting? Shooting! Why, there's no shooting for three months. Well, that's all right, I can wait. In season, we have the best in the shooting in the country, you must come. Make yourself comfortable! Say no more, I'm your man… You're right. Yeah, anything, everything with (inaudible). Hunt? Never known to refuse. Ah. What state can match the chase in full cry, each vying with his fellow which shall be most happy? A thousand deaths fly by unheeded in that one hour's life of ecstasy. Time is outrun, and nature seems to grudge our bliss by making the day so short. No, for then rises up the idol of my great adoration. Who's that? The bottle… Oh-ho, the bottle. Wine and love are the only two indescribable things in nature but I prefer the wine, because its consequences are more easily got rid of. How so? Well, love ends in marriage. Well, I can promise you the finest bottle that ever was cracked. Never mind the bottle, give me the wine. Say no more, but, when I arrive, just shake one of my hands, and put the key of the cellar into the other. I foresee some happy days. And I some glorious nights. Now, it mustn't be a flying visit. I despise the word, I'll stop a month' with you. Or a year or two. I'll come live with you. Ha! ha! Remember! Max Harkaway, Oak Hall, Oldberry, Gloucestershire. I'll remember, hey, fare ye well, I say, Tallyho-o-o-o! Yoicks! Tallyho-o-o-o! There I am quartered for a couple of years at the least. The old boy wants somebody to ride his horses, shoot his game, and keep a watch on the morals of the parish, I'm eligible. What a lucky accident to meet Young Courtly last night! Who could have thought it? Yesterday, I could not make certain of a dinner, except I stole it, today, I would flirt with a banquet. What infernal row was that? Why, are you here still? Yeah. Ain't you delighted? I'll ring, and send the servant for my luggage. The devil you will! Why, you don't mean to say you seriously intend to take up a permanent residence here? Now, that's a most inhospitable insinuation. Might I ask your name? With a deal of pleasure, Richard Dazzle, late of the Unattached Volunteers, vulgarly entitled the Dirty Buffs. Then, Mr. Richard Dazzle, I have the honor of wishing you a very good morning. Martin, show this gentleman the door. If he does, I'll kick Martin out of it. No offence. Now, sir, permit me to place a dioramic view of your conduct before you. After bringing you safely home this morning, after indulgently waiting, whenever you took a passing fancy to a knocker or bell-pull, after conducting a retreat that would have done credit to Napoleon, you would throw me into the street, like a mangy cur, and that's what you call gratitude. Now, look here… Now, to show you how superior I am to petty malice, I give you an unlimited invitation to my house, my country house, to remain as long as you please. Your house! Oak Hall, Oldberry, Gloucestershire, (inaudible). Well, it nominally belongs to my old friend and relation. Max Harkaway. Yeah, he's Capital old fellow, say, shall we be honored? Permit me to hesitate a moment, let me see, I go back to college tomorrow, so I shalln't be missed here and my creditors are beginning to muster, here is thunder, there shelter awaits. In reply to your most generous and kind invitation, if you be an earnest I should feel delighted to accept it. Certainly. Mr. Charles, there is a gentlemen by the name Solomon Isaacs in the hall, who wishes to speak with you. Solomon Isaacs, I don't recall any Solomon Isaacs, who is he? His card. No, there, there must be some kind of mistake, see. I… I… I don't have any dealings with the, uh… you know, Solomon Isaacs. He… he does sound terribly. His meaning is clear enough sir. He speaks of credit, settlement and litigation. Then off we go through the stables, down the mews and so slip through my friend's finger. Don't let my dad see him. But, stay, you must do the polite, say farewell to him before you part. Hang it, don't cut him! Did you jest! Nah, give me the card. Now, then. "Our respects to Mr Isaacs, sorry to have been prevented from seeing him." [sil.] We'll send him up some game. Thanks for the loan, your capital couldn't be safer in a British bank. [music] Oh, James. Miss Grace desires me to request that you will watch at the avenue, and let her know when the squire's carriage is seen on the London road. I will go to the lodge. [sil.] How I do long to see what kind of a man Sir Harcourt Courtly is! Well, it isn't often you get meet a man from a different century, is it? He's dumb well to make it to 1841. What about all the wars we've had and the cholera and the new bear act. But he is gonna be in Miss Grace's bed. He should be in the British Museum. I told Miss Grace, I said you should get the parson to change the ceremony. Well, it's no use, Sir Harcourt Courtly saying, "I do." Is it? No, what we need to hear him say is, "Yes, don't worry, I still can." She doesn't seem to care whether he is sixty or sixteen, jokes at love, prepares for matrimony as she would for dinner, But it didn't have a strange menu, when every dish is mutton dressed as lamb. Well, Pert? Any sign of the squire yet? No, Miss Grace, but James has gone to watch the road. In my uncle's letter, he mentions a Mr. Dazzle, whom he has invited, so you must prepare a room for him. He is some friend of my husband that is to be, and my uncle seems to have taken an extraordinary predilection for him. Apropos! I must not forget to have a flower for the dear old man when he arrives. The dear old man! Do you mean your fiancee? For heaven's sake, no, my uncle, of course. What do I care for Sir Harcourt Courtly? Isn't it odd. Miss, that you have never seen your intended, though you've been so long betrothed? Not at all, marriage matters are conducted nowadays in a most mercantile manner, and besides, my prescribed husband was obliged to spend a great deal of time on the continent. Oh, oh, why is that Miss? Thrift. "I'm reliably informed that certain of the essentials of life for an elderly bachelorette can be purchased at less expense on the continent. Well, I don't know. I like to inspect the goods, before I buy them. If I ever marry it'll be for love. And God, help him if he's not young and healthy. Oh, Pert. A young husband might expect affection and nonsense, which it would be deceitful to return, nor would a young man permit me to remain with my uncle. Sir Harcourt Courtly takes me with the encumbrances he's on his estate, and I shall beg to be left among the rest of the livestock. Two gentlemen, Miss Grace, have just alighted. Very well, James. Pert, remember this as a maxim, a woman is always in love with one of two things. And what are they, Miss? A man, or herself and I know which is the most profitable. Oh, (inaudible). Oh, here comes Mr. Meddle, the solicitor. Sailed in London, so he watches up here, (inaudible) spending each day hovering like a stain seeking a sheet. Mrs. Pert, good mooring, have you read the… No. What do you know… Nothing. You do not know of what I (inaudible)? For you and your profession, I know nothing. The trouble with my profession is the 9/10 of lawyers give the rest of us a bad name. We understand the marriage is about to be celebrated of Sir Harcourt Courtly, Baronet, the fashionable London celebrity and Miss. Grace Harkaway at the Oak Hall, Oldberry. What do you know? Nothing. I'd rather give my honor to a French sailor as she (inaudible) private business. You… you're no better than a pig, snouting around in the dust-hole of society. That's liable and liable can be expensive. And what truth is not liable? Not much information elicited from that witness. Come along, this way! Who comes here? (inaudible) one at a family, I must know him. Sir. Ah. How are you? Quite well, just arrived. Came from London, yeah. Oh, I considered a legal practice in London. But the truth is I prefer country society. Sir, show me some respect. Please, do not lie to me. Sir, I'm a well regarded lawyer, qualified at the bar. What makes you think I'm lying? It's okay. There are those lawyers, who can deceive by talking, my modest claim is that I know the law. Well, in my experience the best kind of lawyer is not one who knows the law, it's one who knows the judge. Might I request the honor of knowing who I address? Richard Dazzle, Esquire, and you? Mark Meddle, attorney-at-law. Dazzle. What detained you? My dear fellow, I have just seen such a woman! Permit me to introduce you to my friend, Puddle. Meddle. He's a capital fellow, know him. I feel honored. Who is your friend? Oh, he? What, my friend? Augustus Hamilton, from London. Augustus Hamilton. How do you do? Good. Oh, look, look, there she is again! Who is she? Well, that's Miss Grace. Of course, Grace. Then I'll go and introduce myself. What are you about? Would you insult my old friend, Mr. Piddle here. Mr. Piddle? My name is Meddle, Mark Meddle, attorney-at-law. So take instructions from me Piddle. Meddle. Shove my friend dear from London asides, while I say, "Hi, how do you do?" to my young friend, Grace. Well, cultivate his acquaintance. Dazzle. Mr. Hamilton, might I take the liberty… Confound the fellow! Sir, what did you remark? Sir? She's gone! Oh, are you here still, Mr. Fiddle? My name is Meddle, sir. Yes, look, I'll tell you what you are, you're a bore. How excessively odd. Mr. Fiddle, would you take a word of advice? I feel honored. Get out. I don't understand. Delighted to quicken your apprehension. Get out before I throw you out. I think this intercourse is turning my way, for what is more profitable than libel, and more easily prosecuted? Assault. And Mr. Hamilton, I'm going nowhere. You are an ass, Fiddle. Look, are you ambitious of a kicking? Oh, yes please. Kick me just there, I'll be good. Here, she comes again. I'll… I'll speak to her. But, sir what about the kicking? Go to the devil. Damn. There goes my chance of making a living. How can a lawyer practice his profession here in the country, where every dispute is settled by gunfire? Oh, they're coming this way. Mr. Hamilton in close conversation with Lady Courtly that-is-to-be. Wait. Oh, I think this could be the stuff of dreams. A trespass against the husband-to-be, no less. Courtly versus Hamilton, Meddle, council for the plaintiff and chief witness, that's at least a guinea a day. I'll take down their conversation verbatim. Yes, that's right. Through the far door just at the end. Yes. Do as she says Dazzle. [sil.] Perhaps you would follow your friend in to the dining room, Mr. Hamilton. Refreshment after your long journey must be requisite. Pardon me, madam, but the lovely garden and the loveliness before me is better refreshment than I could procure in any dining-room. Mm-hmm. Your company and compliments arrive together. I trust that a passing remark will not spoil so welcome an introduction as this by offending you. Oh, I am not certain that anything you could say would offend me. No, I never meant… I thought not. In turn pardon me, when I request you will commence your visit with this piece of information, I consider compliments impertinent and sweet meat language fulsome. Now you have just arrived from town, I apprehend? This moment I left mighty London, under the fever of a full season, groaning with the noisy pulse of wealth and the giddy, whirling brain of fashion. Enchanting, busy London. How have I prevailed on myself to desert you. Next week the new ballet comes out, the week after comes Ascot, Oh… It must be agony for you. It's torture! Can you tell me how you manage to avoid suicide here? I mean, if there was but an opera, even with in twenty miles. I… I say, we… we couldn't get up a rustic ballet among the village girls, could we… I am afraid you would find that difficult. Yes. How I contrive to support life I don't know. It is strange, but I have not precisely contemplated suicide yet, nor do I miss the opera. But how can you manage to kill time? I can't. Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them. I have many employments, this week I devote to cultivating the garden, next week to being married, the following week to repentance perhaps. Married. You seem surprised. Oh, no. I believe it is of frequent occurrence in the metropolis, is it not? Oh, yes, I believe they do it, there. Might I ask to whom? Oh, I have never seen him yet, but he's a gentleman who has been strongly recommended to me for the situation of husband. Recommended. Is he a husband or a restaurant? Would you not consider it advisable to see him first? You must be aware that fashion says otherwise. But you seem to laugh at love. Love! Why, the very word is a breathing satire upon a man's reason. The squire, madam, has just arrived, and another gentleman with him. My intended, I suppose. Why should I layout my life upon the bare security of a man's word? No. When I'm in love, spit in my face and call me horse. [sil.] What did she mean by that? Hang me if I can understand her. She is… she… she is evidently not used to society. She… she… she said she was about to marry but I rather imagine she was in jest. [sil.] On my life, I feel very queer at the contemplation of such an idea, I'll follow her. Oh. Perhaps Mr. Fiddle here can inform me something about her. It won't do. It's not to be done. What do you mean? Counsel retained, cause to come off. Cause to come off. Miss Grace is about to be married. Is it possible? Certainly. If I have the drawing out of the deeds. To who? Oh, I dare say. He has information being scarce in the market, I hope to make mine valuable. Now look here… That's right. Hit me. I'll run and ascertain the truth of this from Dazzle. Mr. Hamilton just… just look me out. It's of no use. He either dare not hit me, or he can't afford it. In either case, he is beneath my notice. This way, sir. Who comes here? Oh, can it be Sir Harcourt Courtly himself? It can be no other. Sir, I have the honor to bid you welcome to Oak Hall and the village of Oldbury. Excessively polite. Must be a solicitor. Sir, thank you. We do not pretend to compete with London society sir, this is after all the country, and yet Oldbury is not in substantial, it has 2,000 inhabitants. All members of the same family. I can charge him six and eight pence for information like that. It's not much, but it's a start. If you will permit me sir, I can inform you of the different commodities for which it is famous. Pork. Yes. What else? That's it. I am much obliged… Nearly there. But here comes Sir Harcourt Courtly, my master, and Mr. Harkaway. Any other time, I shall feel delighted. Oh. Mistook the man for the master. Here we are at last. Good grief. Now give ye welcome to Oak Hall, Sir Harcourt, heartily. Cool, assist me. Come on Courtly, shape up. [sil.] Why, you require more grooming than my prize mare Kitty. Tell Meddle:, what did you think of my park as we came along? That it would never come to an end. You said it was only a stone's throw from your infernal lodge to the house. It's ten miles at least, without pavement, and every yard is knee deep in manure. It would've been quicker to swim. I'll do it in ten minutes any day. Cool, perfume my handkerchief. Don't! perfume in the country! That'll be high treason in the very face of nature, 'tis introducing the robbed to the robber. In the meadows, are the sweets from which your fulsome essences are pilfered, and libeled with their names, don't insult them, too. Oh! Pick me a bouquet, my man! Ah, Meddle, how are you? This is lawyer Meddle. Oh! I took him for one of your people. Oh, naturally, Sir Harcourt Courtly, I have the honor to congratulate to you for the… the… the happy occasion that's gonna happen for you. Cool, is the conversation addressed towards me? Well, I have no plans to take a wife, Sir. [sil.] Certainly! I was complimenting you. Forgive me sir, but I am only in the habit of receiving compliments only from the fair sex. Is this the practice in the country called men flatter men. Yes, sir, my advice is do not encourage him or he may ask you to dance. If the future Lady Courtly be visible at so unfashionable an hour as this, I shall beg to be introduced. Visible! Ever since six this morning, I'll warrant ye. James, two to one she is at dinner. Dinner? At half past one. Is it possible Lady Courtly dines in the early afternoon? In the country, they eat when they are hungry. I'm in hell and who is addressing you? I do beg pardon. Ah, James, tell Miss Grace to come here directly. Now prepare, Courtly, for, though I say it, she is with the exception of my bay mare, Kitty, the handsomest thing in the country. Considering she is a biped, she is a wonder! Full of blood, sound wind and limb, plenty of bone, sweet coat, in fine condition, with a thoroughbred step. Oh, don't compare her to a horse! I wouldn't, but she's almost as fine a creature. Oh, yes, very similar beast. You're a lawyer, Mr. Dripple, what do you know about women? My dear uncle! Ah, Grace, you little jade. And I'm astonished and delighted. She is a rural Venus. Won't you kiss your old uncle? Yes charming. You are not glad to see me, you are not. I should be sorry to curtail any little ebullition of affection, but, ahem! Might I be permitted? Of course, you may. There, Grace, is Sir Harcourt, your husband that will be. [sil.] Go to him, girl. Permit me to do homage to the charms, the presence of which has placed me in sight of Paradise. Come. Ah! Old fellow, how are you? Oh, I'm glad to see you! Are you comfortably quartered, yet, eh? Well, splendidly quartered! What a place you've got here! Why it's a palace. Here, Hamilton. Permit me to introduce my friend, Augustus Hamilton. Good heavens. He… he is a capital fellow! Drinks like a sieve, and rides like a thunder-storm. Sir, I'm devilish glad to see you. Permit me to introduce to you to Sir Harcourt. The devil! What's the matter? Why, that is my dad, by Jupiter! What, the old (inaudible), just don't say. It… it… it is, what's to be done now? I don't know. Mr. Hamilton, Sir Harcourt Courtly. Sir Harcourt Courtly, Mr. Hamilton. How do you do, Mr. Hamilton. [sil.] Good gracious! I can't believe, Charles, is it possible? Why. Max, that is my son! Your son! Your son. No. [sil.] He's much younger than he looks. Charles, why don't you answer me, sir? What shall I say? Deny your identity. What's the matter, sir? How came you down here, sir? By one of Newman's best fours in twelve hours and a quarter. And isn't your name Charles Courtly? Not to my knowledge. Do you mean to say that you are usually called Augustus Hamilton? Lamentable fact and quite correct. How very odd? Well, I never. Cool, come here. [sil.] Is that my son? No, sir, that is not Mr. Charles, but he's very like him. I cannot understand all this. I think I can. Give him a touch of the indignant. Allow me to say, sir, what… what do you call them Sir Horse'n Cartly. Cart Horse Fartly. Fartly, no, no, Courtly, sir. Well, well, Mr. Coarse and Haughty, I say… I say your conduct is a… a… and… and… and were it not for the presence of this lady here, I should feel inclined to… to… to… Oh, no, this can't be my son. He never would address me in that way. Sir, sir, you r likeness to my son Charles is so astonishing, that it for a moment, I… I… equilibrium of my etiquette-pon my life I-permit me to request your pardon. Don't apologize, bring an action. Can someone take this man away? Luncheon is on the table, sir. Miss Grace Harkaway, I… I never swore before a lady, in my life, except when I promised to love and cherish the late Lady Courtly, which I took care to preface with an apology. But… but to that gentleman's identity I would have pledged-my own hair. Risking nothing there then. Mr. Harkaway, I have got something very particular to communicate. I can't listen at present. Oh, don't bother. Go to hell, Piddle. Ah, Mr. Cool, can you oblige me. Why, what is all this? Small account versus you, to giving information concerning the last census of the population of Oldbury and vicinity, its six and eight pence. Oh, you mean to make me pay this, do you? Unconditionally. Well, I have no objection, the charge seems fair. But sir, I am a servant on board wages, will you throw in a little advice gratis, if I give you the money? Very well. For you. A fellow has insulted me. I want to abuse him. What terms are actionable? You may call him anything you please, providing there are no witnesses. Oh, may I? The n like all lawyers sir you have the principles of a pick-pocket combined with the moral sense of a latrine. Libel. Slander. Aye, but where are you r witnesses? Give me the costs, six and eight pence. I deny that you gave me information at all. You do. Yes, where are you r witnesses? Dang. [sil.] What can I do? Turn them out, civilly. They've only been two days? Why, they are disreputable characters. As that young fellow, in whom the future Lady Courtly appears so particularly absorbed, I am bewildered. I have written to town, summoning Charles, my boy. It certainly is the most extraordinary likeness. [sil.] Max! What is that? It's a rat. Don't you have them in London. I'm in the habit of shooting them, but Pert has begged me to give it up. Well, you shoot them indoors? I keep a fully charged blunder buss in the billiard room. It's tremendous sport but not good for the carpets. Sir Harcourt, I have an idea. I am delighted to hear it. That fellow is a swindler. I met him at your house. What? Never saw him before I came here in all my life. I will bet you five to one that I can beat you three out of four games at billiards with one hand behind my back. No, sir. I don't mind giving you ten points in fifty. Sir, I never gamble. You don't. Well, I'll teach you. It's the easiest thing in the world. But you have every requisite, a good temper. I have not, sir. Ah. A wise old owl eh? Neither owl, nor old sir. Really, Mr. Hamilton, you amaze me. After an acquaintanceship of two days, you sit down to teach me chess and domestic economy at the same time. Might I ask where you graduated in that science, where you learned all that store of matrimonial advice which you have obliged me with? I imbibed it, madam, from the moment I beheld you, and having studied my subject con amore, took my degrees from your eyes. I see you are a Master of Arts already. Unfortunately, no. I… I must remain a bachelor, till you can assist me to that honor. How you getting on? Splendidly. Keep your old boy away. Is the conversation strictly confidential, or might I join? We were discussing rifle shooting. Have you got a rifle? Good heavens no. I have people to shoot for me. Oh, it's an excellent diversion in the summer months. I don't need diverting. Excuse me. Well, I could teach you to shoot. Have you got a good eye? I have two good eyes, now sir, step aside, I demand access. Here she comes. What the devil is that? That sir is Lady Gay Spanker, coming across the lawn at a hard gallop. Bless me, that poor horse. Look how she takes that fence. Lady Gay Spanker? Who may she be? Gay Spanker, Sir Harcourt? My cousin and dearest friend. You must like her. It will be my devoir, since it is your wish, though it will be a hard task in your presence. I am sure she will like you. I flatter myself. Who and what is she? Glee, glee made a living thing. Nature in some frolic mood shut up a merry devil in her eye and, spiting art, stole joy's brightest harmony to thrill her laugh which peals out sorrow's knell. Her cry rings loudest in the field, the very echo loves it best, and as each hill attempts to ape her voice, earth seems to laugh that it made a thing so glad. Aye, the merriest minx I ever kissed. Max. Come in, you mischievous puss. [sil.] Well, governor, how are ye? You too Grace, my dear? There, don't fidget, Max, and there… there's one for you. Oh, gracious. I didn't see you had visitors. Permit me to introduce, Sir Harcourt Courtly, Lady Gay Spanker. Mr. Dazzle, Mr. Hamilton, Lady Gay Spanker. A devilish fine woman. You mustn't think anything of the liberties I take with this old dog. Bless him. [sil.] I am so glad you have come, Sir Harcourt. Now we can make a decent figure at the heels of a hunt. Does your Ladyship hunt? I… I… I say, governor, does my ladyship hunt? I rather flatter myself that I do hunt. Why, Sir Harcourt, one might as well live without laughing as without hunting, it is indigenous to humanity. Man was formed expressly to fit a horse. Are not the hedges and ditches created for leaps? Of course, and I look upon foxes to be the most blessed dispensation of a benign providence. Yes, it is all very well in the abstract. I tried it once. Once. Only once? Once, only once. And then the animal ran away with me. You… you would not have him walk. Finding my society disagreeable, he instituted a series of kicks, with a view to removing the annoyance, but, aided by the united stays of the mane and tail, I frustrated his intentions. His next resource, however, was more effectual, for he succeeded in rubbing me off against a tree, in which I took refuge. How absurd you must have looked, like an over ripe plum, pleading to be plucked. Sir. I never looked like a plum in all my life. I pity you, Sir Harcourt. It was criminal in your parents to neglect your education so shamefully. Well, possibly, but be assured I shall never fracture my neck awkwardly from a horse, when it might be accomplished with less trouble falling from a bedroom window. You must leave your town habits in the smoke of London, here, in the country, we rise with the lark. Never seen it, never heard it. Oh, the man that misses sunrise loses the sweetest part of his existence. Pardon me, I have seen sunrise frequently after a ball, or from the window of my travelling carriage, and I always considered it excessively disagreeable. Well, I love to watch the first tear that glistens in the opening eye of morning, the silent song the flowers breathe, the thrilly choir of the woodland minstrels to which the modest brook trickles applause, these, seem to pour some soft and merry tale into the daylight's ear, as if the waking world had dreamed a happy thing, and now smiled over the telling of it. The effect of a rustic education! Oh, where's the music in a damp foggy morning. The whole sit symphony of morning is discordant. In particular that miserable street vendor who insists on crying coffee underneath my window just as I'm persuading myself to sleep. Now that is a crime against music. No, no, no, no. The morning is for sleep, the afternoon, for waking and if you must have music its place is in the evening. In fact, I never heard any music worth listening to, except in Italy. Well, then you never heard a well-trained English pack, full cry. Full cry! Aye. There is harmony, if you will. Give me the trumpet neigh, the spotted pack just catching scent. What a chorus in their yelp. The view-halloo, blent with a peal of free and fearless mirth. Now that's our old English music, match it where you can. Ah. Sir Harcourt, have you been here a month ago, you would have witnessed the most glorious run that ever swept over merry England's green cheek, a steeplechase, sir, which I intended to win, but my best horse broke down the day before. I had a chance, notwithstanding, on my bay mare kitty and but for Gay here I should have won. Oh, it was glorious Max, glorious. There were sixty horses in the field, all mettle to the bone. The start was a picture. Away we went in a cloud, it was pell-mell, helter-skelter. The fools first as usual, using themselves up. We soon passed them, first your Kitty, and then my Blueskin and Craven's colt third. Then came the tug. Kitty skimmed the walls, Blueskin flew over the fences, the colt neck and neck and half a mile to run. Now, it done, the colt baulked a leap and went wild with the place myself. Max, (inaudible) the last wall, six feet, if an inch, and a ditch on the other side. Now, for the first time, I gave Blueskin his head. Away he flew like a thunderbolt. Over went the mare, I over the same spot, leaving Max in the ditch. Walked the steeplechase, eight miles in thirty minutes, and scarcely turned a hair. Bravo. Bravo [sil.] Well, I see to Lady Gay Spanker. Bravo. Do you hunt? Hunt. I belong to a hunting family. I was born on horseback and cradled in a kennel. Aye, and I hope I may die with a whoo-whoop. The earth flies back to aid our course. Horse, man, hound, earth, heaven, you see? It's all, all, one piece of glowing ecstasy. Then I love the world, myself and every living thing. And I could wish that all creation had but one mouth that I might kiss it. I wish I were that mouth. Why, we will regenerate you, baronet. Aye, we'll regenerate you. But, where is your husband, Gay? Where is Adolphus? Bless me, where is my Dolly? We must find him. You are married, then? Yes. I do have a husband somewhere, though I can't find though it seems he may have escaped. Dolly, Dolly! Governor, at home I always whistle when I want him. [sil.] Here I am. Did you whistle, Gay? Is that your husband? Yes, I know he looks stupid. But that's my Dolly. Permit me to introduce you to Sir Harcourt Courtly. Oh, how do you do? (inaudible). He's kidding, Dolly, it's all right. Delighted to have the honor of making the acquaintance of a gentleman so highly celebrated in the world of fashion. London. Fashion. Steady. Where have you been Dolly? Oh, I was outside. Why did you not come in earlier? I didn't think I did. Oh, I must have forgotten. Shall we have the pleasure of your conversation at dinner? Whoa, stay, whoa. Dinner, yes, I do dine. And yes, unless… unless… Yes, but that's not going to happen tonight. Is it? No. No. Because you have taken your cure, haven't you? No, I couldn't find it. Oh, dear. I'm sure I packed in a bag. It's in your bag. Stay dinner? Of course, and we shall came on purpose to stop two or three days with you. Madam. Your grooms will take your bags upstairs. Evening Squire. Evening Squire. Uh… Who are they? Darling, they're grooms, (inaudible) you know them. Will you excuse our absence Sir Harcourt? What! what! Where are you going? What takes you away? We must postpone the dinner until… No. Never mind that. No, I must go. Stay where you are. Uncle. I say you shan't! I shall be king in my own house. Yes. Do, my dear uncle, you shall be king, and I'll be your prime minister, that is, I will rule, and you shall have the honor of taking the consequences. Well said, Grace, have your own way, it's the only thing we women ought to be allowed. Quite, right. Come along, Gay, dress for dinner. Permit me. Lady Gay. Well, yes, of course. What is it? To escort you. Oh, no, I can escort myself, thank you, and Dolly too, come, dear! We're going to go upstairs. Oh. Very well. Au revoir Monsieur. Fellow is a frog. [sil.] What an ill-assorted pair. Not a bit. She married him for freedom, and she has it. He married her for protection and he has it. Well, how he ever summoned the courage to propose to her, I can't guess. Courage? That man, with only a small troop, sacked Copenhagen in 1807. Terrified the townsfolk, took the Danish fleet, and left two thousand dead. Him? Let's take a turn before dinner. He has two states, night and day, both controlled by a strong physic. Mr. Charles, I have been watching to find you alone. Sir Harcourt has written to town. The devil he has. He expects you here this evening. But I'm already here. No. You're not here. Mr. Hamilton is here. You will arrive this evening and punctual. Oh! he'll be punctual. A thought strikes me. Pooh! Confound your thoughts! I… I can think of nothing but the idea of leaving Grace, at the very moment when I had established the most… What if I can prevent her marriage with your Governor? Impossible! Well, he's pluming himself for the conquest of Lady Gay Spanker. Really? Really. Look it won't be difficult to make him believe, she accedes to his suit. And if she join in the plan. Would you? Do you think she would? I mistake my game if she would not. Here comes Sir Harcourt! I'll begin with him. Retire, and watch how I'll open the campaign for you. [sil.] Here is that cursed fellow again? Indeed, sir. Ah, my dear old friend. Mr. Dazzle. I have a secret of importance to disclose to you. Are you a man of honor? Don't speak, you're. It is with the greatest pain that I am compelled to request you, as a gentleman, that you will shun studiously the society of Lady Gay Spanker! Good gracious! And by what right, do you make such a demand? Why, I am distantly related to the Spankers. Why, hang it, sir, if you don't appear to be related to every family in Great Britain! A good many of the nobility, they'll claim me as a connection. But, to return, she is much struck with your maneuvers, which is quite clear she lied us all for this play. [sil.] Well, you surprise me! To entangle you. Yes, well, it did appear like that. Please, spare her for my sake, I give her no encouragement. No. If disgrace come upon my relatives, the Spankers, I would never hold up my head again. I could achieve an easy conquest, and a glorious. I never remarked it before, but this is a gentleman, Mr. Dazzle. May I rely on your generosity? Oh, faithfully. The honor of the Spankers is safe in my hand. Thank you. Sir, I honor and esteem you. But, might I ask, how came you to meet our friend, Max Harkaway, in my house in Belgrave Square? Certainly. I had a promissory note of your son's for a £100. My son's? Oh, no, no, impossible. Ah, sir, fact. Out of the goodness of his heart he paid a debt for a poor unfortunate man, fifteen children, half-a-dozen wives, the devil knows what all. Simple boy! Oh, innocent youth, I have no doubt. Oh, by the way if you have the hundred convenient, I shall feel delighted. Follow me to my room, if you have the document, it will be happiness to me to pay your £100. Poor Charles! Good heart! Oh, a splendid heart! I dare say. Mr. Hamilton. [sil.] Charles, come here, bring your splendid heart here, I need your autograph. What for? Why, to release the unfortunate man and his family from jail. Yes. Who is he? Yourself. But I haven't any wives! Shame on you, fifteen children and no wives. Come, don't be obstinate. Write, and date it back. What am I signing? A promissory note. I.O.U.s of all different colors. I keep them ready drawn in case of necessity, all but the date and acceptance. Here, come on, write. Exactly, you know the place, across, good, and thank your lucky stars that you have found a friend at last that gives you money and advice. I'll give the old gentleman this, then you come and relieve the necessities of your fifteen little unfortunates. Things are building to a climax. I must re-invent myself as myself, but I must first ascertain what are the real sentiments of this riddle of a woman. Does she love me? And… and… and even if she does, is it right to pursue this affair since my rival is also my father? As… as a dutiful son, I should feel concerned for his happiness, damn it. Wait, I… I feel assured if Grace Harkaway becomes his bride, he will forever be miserable. It… it is therefore my duty as a loving son, clearly, to save my father by marrying her myself. In a moment uncle. By Jove, here she comes. [sil.] Oh, bother. I wish I had never seen Mr. Hamilton. Why do I shudder at the contemplation of this marriage, which till now was to me a subject of perfect indifference? Am I in love? [sil.] Love. I, the infidel, the railer! Oh, no, I can't be in love, I'm far too busy. Meditating upon matrimony, madam? He little thinks he was the subject of my meditations. No, Mr. Hamilton, I never give it a thought. I must unmask my battery now. How foolish I am. I'm trembling. That can't be good. I must appear at ease. Madam. Yes. I, yes… yes, well… [sil.] Ah, how very awkward. Madam. Yes. Madam, there was, there is… is, I mean, no, no, I… I was about to remark that, no, no, umm… no, I… I was about to observe a… a… It's a very difficult subject to begin! Sit. Wait. Be patient. Come on man. You've made love to a hundred women before this one struck you dumb. I… I must attack her in her own way. I was I had something to do for I have nothing to say. Madam. Yes? Madam. There is a subject so fraught with fate to my future life that you must pardon any lack of delicacy, should a too hasty expression mar the fervent courtesy of its intent. To you, I feel aware, I must appear in the light of a comparative stranger. But of you I know too much for my own peace. Is he drunk? I forget all that befell before I saw your beauteous self, I feel born into another world, my nature changed. The beams of that bright face falling on my soul have from its chaos warmed into life the flowrets of affection, whose maiden odors now float towards the sun, pouring forth on their pure tongue a mite of adoration midst the voices of a universe. That's her kind of thing. Mr. Hamilton. How could you? You cannot feel surprised… I am more than surprised. I am delighted. [sil.] Do… do… do not speak so coldly. You have offended me deeply. No, madam. No… no woman, whatever her state, can be offended by the adoration even of the meanest. It… it… it is myself whom I have offended and deceived, but still I ask your pardon. Oh. He thinks I'm refusing him. Mr. Hamilton, I am not exactly offended, but… Consider my position, a few days, and an insurmountable barrier would have placed you beyond my wildest hopes. How so? You would have been my mother. I should have been your mother. I thought so. No, no, no, that… that is Sir Harcourt's bride. Never. Ah, never? May I then hope? [sil.] You turn away. You would not lacerate by a refusal. How stupid, he is. Still silent! Well, I… I… I thank you. Miss Grace, I… I ought to have expected this fool that I have been, one course alone remains, farewell! Now he's going. Farewell forever! Will… will you not speak one word? I shall leave this house immediately, I shall not see you again. Unhand me, sir, I insist. Oh! Damn of course, I should have taken her hand. What, release this hand? Never! Never! Never will I quit this hand! It shall be my companion in misery, in solitude, when you are far way. Oh! Should anyone come! Oh, for heaven's sake, do not kneel. What? Yes, yes. Forever thus prostrate, before my soul's saint, I will lead a pious life of eternal adoration. Oh, should we be discovered thus pray, Mr. Hamilton pray. Our father, which (inaudible). Your conduct is shameful. It is. And if I do not scream, it is not for your sake, but it might alarm the family. It might, it would. Say, do you care nothing for me. I entreat one word, I implore. You do not withdraw your hand. You smile. Leave me, dear Mr. Hamilton! Dear! Then I am dear to you, that word once more, say, say you love me! Is this fair? (inaudible). [sil.] Don't mind me. I… I… I was just about to, umm… Yes, I saw that bit. [sil.] Oh, madam, how… how could you mar my bliss, in the very ecstasy of its fulfillment? Well, I always like to be in at the kill. Never drop your ears. Bless you, she is only a little fresh. Give her her head and she will tire herself out. Yes, possibly, but in the meantime what am I to do? Keep your seat. But in a few days she will take a leap that must throw me, she marries Sir Harcourt Courtly. Oh, that is awkward, certainly, but you can challenge him, and shoot him. [sil.] Un… un… unfortunately, that is out of the question. How so? You… you will not betray a secret, if I inform you? Well, no, what is it? I am his son. His son? And he does not know you? No, no, not here, I… I met him here, by chance, and faced it out. I told him, I never saw him before in my life. Oh, this is beautiful. I see it all, so you're in love with your mother, and want to make her your wife. Now, I… I… I… I think I can outstrip the old gentleman, if you will but lend us your assistance. Well, yes, in anything. You must know, then, that my dad, Sir Harcourt, has fallen desperately in love with you. With me! [sil.] Oh, this is delicious! Now… now… now, if… if you only could… I will… I will. I see my cue. I'll cross his scent, I'll draw him after me or won't I make love to him? He's, now… now the only objection might be your husband. Mr. Spanker, who… who might… Oh, no, no he'll make no objection. He's an inestimable little character, you don't know him as well as I do, I dare say, oh, here they come for supper. I'll shall commence my operations on your Governor immediately! how I shall enjoy it! Be careful! Sir the musicians are outside ready to play for your guests before dinner. Splendid. Sir Harcourt, do you lead Grace. Miss. Harkaway. I think Sir Harcourt is promised to me. [sil.] Well, please yourselves. [music] [sil.] [music] [sil.] If there be one habit more abominable than another, it is that of the gentlemen sitting over their wine, it is a selfish, unfeeling fashion, and a gross insult to our sex. Yes. We are turned out just when the fun begins. The signal for the ladies to withdraw is anxiously and deliberately waited for. Then I begin to wish I were a man. [sil.] The instant the door is closed upon us, there rises a roar! In celebration of their short-lived liberty, my love, their rejoicing in their temporary emancipation. Well, I think it very insulting, whatever it may be. I am afraid they are getting far too pleasant to be agreeable. Yes, I hope the squire will restrict himself, after his third bottle, he does becomes rather voluminous. Someone is going to sing. Let's hear! Oh no, Gay, for heaven's sake! Bless me, that's my Dolly. You know, I've never heard my Dolly sing before! And he's without his physic, we left it at home. Who know… Mr. Hamilton has just left the house for London. Impossible! That is, without seeing, that is… He never, oh, speak, James! He left. Miss Grace, in a desperate hurry, and this note, I believe, for you. For me! Excuse me, Gay. Oh, yes. Sure. "Your manner during dinner has left me no alternative but instant departure, my absence will release you from the oppression which my society must necessarily inflict on your sensitive mind. It may tend also to smother, though it can never extinguish, that indomitable passion, of which I am the passive victim. Dare I supplicate pardon and oblivion for the past? It is the last request of the self-deceived, but still loving. Augustus Hamilton." Oh. Hallo, Grace! Pull up. What's the matter? Nothing, the heat of the room, it's so very warm. So, what excuse does he give? Particular unforeseen business, I suppose? [sil.] Yes, yes, a mere formula, you may put it in the fire. What? No. Oh. I think it is near enough to the fire where it is. I'm glad he's gone. So am I. He was a disagreeable ignorant person. And so vulgar. No, he was not at all vulgar. I… I mean in appearance. Oh! How can you say so, he was excessively distingue. Well, I might have been mistaken, you see, I took him for as a forward, intrusive. Oh, for heaven's sake. Gay! He was very retiring, even shy. It's all right. She is in love, she blows hot and cold, in the same breath. And how can you be a competent judge? Why, you have not known him more than a few hours, while I… I… I have known him… Two days and a quarter! I yield. I never was, or will be, as intimate with him as you appeared to be! But, my dear sir, consider this state of the two countries under such a constitution. The two countries! What have they to do with the subject? Everything. Look at their two legislative bodies. Yeah, look at their two legislative bodies. Why, it would inevitably establish universal anarchy and confusion. I think they are pretty well established already. What has anarchy and confusion got to do with the subject? Do look at my Dolly, he is arguing talking politics upon my life he is. Mr. Spanker, my dear! Excuse me, love, I am discussing a point of importance. Oh, that is delicious, he must discuss that to me. Dolly! Dolly! Pardon me. Lady Gay Spanker, I will not be treated with that cavaliers spirit. Cavaliers spirit. Which does not become your sex. Dolly, you have been indulging till you have lost, what, little wit with dribbled into your unfortunate little head. [sil.] Your brains want the whipping in, go and lie down, you are not yourself. Madam, I am doubly myself, and permit me to inform you, that I'm less you voluntarily pay obedience to my commands, I shall enforce them. He's gonna inform you. Your Commands? Yes, madam, I mean to put a full stop to your hunting. Who put that thought into your head, for I am sure it is not an original emanation of your genius? Sir Harcourt Courtly, my friend, and now, mark me! If you persist in this absurd rebellion… Well? Contemplate a separation. Walk away. Walk away. This is one thing, you see, Sir Harcourt put him up for this, because he wants him to ill-treat me, so his own suit will thrive. Lady Gay! Here, he is, oh, my God. [sil.] What hours of misery were those I passed, when, by your secession, the dining room suffered a total eclipse. Ah! You flatter. Oh, oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no, believe me, pardon me, I tried to join in the boisterous mirth, but my thoughts would desert here to the drawing-room. Ah! How I envied the careless levity and cool indifference with which Mr. Spanker enjoyed your absence. Max, Max, is Madeira is worth its weight in gold, I hope you have more of it. Six cases, I think. Well, bring them up then man, well, is your Madeira to be enjoyed by your guests or by the spiders of your cellars? Yes, of course. And then I'll almost be in heaven. Almost? Well, I would waited that the only thing that could enhance the experience, it is excellent nectar. Would be a fat Havana. Would you like a cigar? I swear, yeah. If you've got one that will be glorious. Anything else? Well, there is something, yeah. Can't think what, you don't have a free hand? [sil.] James, bring up a case of the Madeira. Certainly sir. And Mr. Charles Courtly has arrived from London! Now. Max, you must see a living apology for my conduct. [sil.] There Max. What do you say now? Swivel, this is the most remarkable likeness. Yes, considering it is the original. I am delighted to see you, sir. Thank you, sir. Ah, you Charles. Come here. No, don't be afraid. Now, now, Charles, this is Lady Gay Spanker. How do you do? Remarkable spectacles. Will you be kind enough to introduce me, Sir Harcourt? This is Mr. Dazzle, Charles. Delighted to make your acquaintance. There, there, there, there you're doing very well, umm… Miss. Harkaway, Charles. [sil.] Charlie this is your new mother, or rather she will be. Madam, I shall love, honor, and obey you punctually. Oh, oh, he's reading. You perceive. Quite unused to society, perfectly ignorant of every conventional rule of life. Sir, the doctor and the young ladies have arrived. Ah. The young ladies. Ladies? Yes, I make it a rule always (inaudible) dinner with a good old country dance. Oh, no. Come, Sir Harcourt. What are the requirements of this country dance? Clogs in a sheep? [sil.] Nothing but a nimble foot and a light heart. Lady Gay, I suffered two allergies, cow's milk and country dancing but you if you were to be my mentor, I might more cheerfully tolerate the inevitable rush. I am engaged, but on such a plea as Sir Harcourt's, I must waive all obstacles. Now, Grace, girl, give your hand to Mr. Courtly. Oh, pray, excuse me, uncle, I have a headache. Charles, amuse your mother during our absence. But don't you dance, Mr. Courtly? Dance, sir! No, I never dance, I… I can procure exercise in a far more rational manner and besides music disturbs my meditations. Well, do the gallant. Yes, I… I never studied that Art, but I… I'm developing a thesis on the extracurricular activates of the holy ghost, which… which might delight her, for it enchanted the Reverend Doctor Pump, of Corpus Christi. Yes, well, good luck with that. Madam? Yes? Dare I confess this trick to her? No… no… no! Not until I have proved her affection indisputably. This calls for invention. Does he think me so stupid that I can't see through his disguise. I rather suspect some plot to entrap me. Madam, I have been desired to amuse you. Thank you. I… I will teach you a lesson. Subject, the effects of inebriation, cause by imbibing spirituous liquors. About an hour before my arrival. I passed an appalling evidence of the effects of this state. A carriage was overthrown, horses killed, gentlemen in a hopeless state with his neck broken, all occasion by the intoxication of the Coachman. How frightful. I found it edifying, nutritious food for reflection. Oh, the… the expiring man desired his best compliments to you. To me? Yes. His name was? Mr. Augustus Hamilton. Augustus! No! Huzza! She loves me. But pray sir, where did this happen? Well, about four miles down the road. He must be conveyed here. Mr. Meddle, madam. The very person. My dear sir. My dear madam. You must execute a very particular commission for me immediately. Mr. Hamilton has met with a frightful accident on the London road. Well. He looks quite well on it. No, you mistake sir, that is not Mr. Hamilton, but Mr. Courtly, who will explain everything to you and conduct you to the spot. No, no, no, no that would be impossible and pointless. Why? Well, I omitted to mention a small fact which occurred before I left Mr. Hamilton. He died. Died! Oh! Then we needn't trouble you, Mr. Meddle. Listen they are starting to play. A turn or two in the dance may help to dispel the gloom. If you would ask me? If I can understand her, hang me. Hears of my death, screams out, and then asks me to dance. Can she suspect me? No. Just over there Mr. Courtly… [music] There we go Sir Harcourt. I know… [music] Clear the fall. [music] (inaudible). Oh, delightly. [music] So Augustus Hamilton is dead. And this gentleman who is his match is named Mr. Courtly. And there's a Mr. Solomon Isaacs, a money lender arrived in old bury from London seeking out for Mr. Charles Courtly indeed he has writs for his arrest. This could mean only one thing. Cash, for Meddle:. This room is less stuffy. What's this? Where are my witnesses. Excuse my, trusting you for support. [sil.] I'm transported. Oh. Allow me to thus ever to support this lovely burden, and I shall conceive that paradise is regained. Oh! Sir Harcourt, I feel very faint. Well, the dancing made you giddy. Yeah. And I have left my salts in the other room. I always carry a flacon, for the express accommodation of the fair sex. Oh, how generous. Thank you. [sil.] What a sigh was there! It is the vapor of consuming grief. Grief? Is it possible, have you a grief? Are you unhappy? Dear me! Am I not married? What a horrible state of existence! I am never contradicted, so there are none of those enlivening, interesting little differences, which so pleasingly diversify the monotony of conjugal life, like rabbit droppings in a field. No quarrels, like oases in the desert of matrimony, no rows. How Vulgar! What a brute! I never have anything but my own way, he won't forbids me to spend more than I like. Oh, mean-Spirited wretch! So how can I help being miserable? Miserable? Miserable, I wonder you are not in a lunatic asylum, with such unheard-of barbarism! Yes. But worse than all that! Can there be worse? Oh, yes, I mean, I could forgive that. I do it is my duty. But just imagine, just picture to yourself, my dear Sir Harcourt, though I, the third daughter of an Earl, married him out of pity, for his destitute and helpless situation as a bachelor with 10,000 a year, just conceive if you can. He actually permit me with a placid indifference to flirt with any old fool I might meet. Oh, good gracious. His terrible experiences during the sacking of Copenhagen almost completely exhausted all his capacity for conflict. Oh, God, miserable. Tragic idiot. I fear there is an incompatibility of temper, which renders a separation almost inevitable. Separation. Indispensable, my dear madam! Ah! Had I been the happy possessor of such a… a realm of bliss, what a beatific eternity unfolds itself to my extending imagination! Had another man but looked at you, I should have annihilated him at once. A man of such a nature is too bright for the eye of thought, too sweet to bear reflection. My devotion, eternal, deep… Oh, Sir Harcourt! Don't be naughty. Your every thought should be a separate study, each wish forestalled by the quick apprehension of a kindred soul. But, alas! How can I avoid my fate? If a life, a heart, were offered to your astonished view by one who is considered the index of fashion, the weather vane of the beau monde, if you saw him at your feet, begging, beseeching your acceptance of all, and more than this, what would your answer be? Ah! But I know of none so devoted! Oh, yes. You do! [sil.] [sil.] Behold Sir Harcourt Courtly! Oh, jesus. The fox has broken cover. Speak, speak, adored, dearest Lady Gay speak, will you fly from the tyranny, the wretched misery of such a monster's roof, and accept the soul which lives but in your presence! Oh, do not press me. Spare a weak, yielding woman. Be contented to know that you alas mean far, far too much dear to me. [sil.] But the world, what would the world would say. Let us establish a precedent to society for a more open and liberal view of matrimonial. How irresistible is your argument! Oh, pause. [sil.] I have ascertained for a fact that every tradesman lives with his wife, and thus you see marriage it has become a vulgar and plebeian custom. Oh, stop it, Sir Harcourt. I cannot withstand your powers of persuasion. Swear you will never desert me. Dictate the oath. May I grow wrinkled, may two inches be added to the circumference of my waist, may I lose the line of my back, may I be old and ugly the instant I forego one tithe of adoration. I must believe you. So shall we leave this detestable rural spot, this horrible vicinity? The sooner the better. Tomorrow evening let it be. For now let me return, because my absence will be remarked upon. Do I appear confused? Has my agitation rendered me unfit to enter the room? No, no, no, more angelic by a lovely tinge of heightened color. Yes, well, I shall take some air to recover myself. Tomorrow at eleven o'clock. Outside the house. Have your carriage waiting, and four horses. Remember, please, be particular about four. Don't let the affair come off shabbily. Adieu, my dear Sir Harcourt. [sil.] Veni, vidi, vici. Caesar, Hannibal, Napoleon, Alexander never completed so fair a conquest in so shorter time. She dropped fascinated. Poor creature. How she loves me. I pity so prostrating a passion, and ought to return it, I will, I will, it is the duty I owe to fashion and society. This is an unprecedented example of the irresistible force of personal appearance, combined with Portuguese smelling salts. [sil.] There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken in the flood, leads on to fortune. For in a court of law, that is adultery. Spanker versus Courtly, damage is £15,000 for the fees add a note. Gay, where you? Gay. I cannot find Gay anywhere. The plaintiff himself, Mr. Spanker, as I have information of deep, vital importance to impart, will you take a seat? Well, yes, yes. Thank you. Now, you have a wife? I believe, I… Will you be kind enough, without any prevarication, to answer my questions? You have a wife. Oh, you alarm me, I… I compose yourself and reserve your feelings, take time to consider. You have a wife? Yes. Good. He has a wife, a bonafide wife gentlemen of the jury. Bounds morally and legally to be your wife, and nobody else's in effect, except on your written permission… But what is this… Silence in court. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Allow me, my dear sir, to congratulate you. What for? Lady Gay Spanker is about to dishonor the bond of wedlock by eloping from you. What? I thought you would be overjoyed. If you place the affair in my hands, I will venture to promise the largest damages on record. Damn the damages! I want my wife. I'll beg her not to run away. She may hunt, she may ride, anything she likes. Let us put a stop to this affair. Put a stop to it? Do not alarm me, sir. Sir, you will spoil the most exquisite brief that was ever penned. I have driven her to this. It was all that damned brandy. What a fool I was! It was the happiest moment of your life. So I thought at the time, tell me, who is the, uh… The vile seducer? The vile seducer. Yes. Who is he? Sir Harcourt Courtly. [sil.] He is my best friend. I should think he is. If you will accompany me, here is a verbatim copy of the whole transaction in short-hand, a sworn to by me. Only let me have Gay back again. Even that may be arranged, this way. That ever I should live to see my wife run away. Oh, no, it's terrible. Help me Peddle. Its Meddle, did you get it? Oh, poor Dolly, I'm sorry to have go on deceiving him, but if he would, but liven up a little bit. So that fellow overheard all, well, so much the better. My dear madam, how fares the plot? Does my Governor nibble? Nibble! He is caught, and in the basket. I have just left him with a hooks tucked in his gills, panting for very lack of element. But how goes it on your encounter? Oh, bravely. By a simple ruse, I have discovered that she loves me, possibly. I… I can see but one obstacle to the best termination I could hope. What is it? My dad has just told me that I return to town again tomorrow. Well, I insist you stop and dine with us, you just keep out of the way. Oh, but what excuse can I offer for disobedience? What can I say when he sees me before dinner? Say… say Grace. I have arranged to elope myself with Sir Harcourt tomorrow night. The deuce you have! Now if you could persuade Grace to follow that example, the carriage will be waiting at the Park Gate, be there shortly before eleven, it will just forestall our departure. Do you… Do you think you can make her agree to that? Oh, oh, without the slightest difficulty. Well, success attend you. I will bend the haughty Grace. Yeah, you do that. Yes. [music] This is the most serious affair Sir Harcourt has ever been engaged in. I took the liberty of considering him a fool when he told me he was going to marry, but voluntarily to incur another man's encumbrance is very little short of madness. If he continues to conduct himself in this absurd manner, I shall be compelled to dismiss him. Cool! Sir Harcourt. Is my chariot in waiting? For the last half hour at the Park Gate, sir. On the table. But, pardon the insinuation, sir, would it not be more advisable to hesitate a little for a short reflection before you undertake the heavy responsibility of a woman? No, no, hesitation destroys the romance of amourefau, and reduces it to the level of a mere mercantile calculation. What is to be done with Mr. Charles? Aye, much… much against my wishes Lady Gay prevailed on me to permit him to remain. So, Cool, you must return him to college. Pass through town, and deliver these papers, here is a small notice of the coming elopement for the Morning Post, and this, by an eye-witness, for the Herald, this, with all the particulars, for the Chronicle, and the full and circumstantial account for the evening journals, after which, meet us in Boulogne. Very good. Sir Harcourt. Lose no time. Remember Boulogne-sur-Mer. Hotel Anglais. Oh, no. And, bring a few copies of the papers with you, don't forget to distribute some amongst very particular friends. It shall be done. [sil.] With what indifference does a man of the world view the approach of the most perilous catastrophe! How many roses will fade upon the cheek of beauty, when the defalcation of Sir Harcourt Courtly is first hinted, and then whispered, at last, confirmed and advertised. I think I see them. And then, on my return, they will not dare to eject me, I am their sovereign! Whoever attempts to think of treason, I'll cut him, I'll put him out of fashion! Ill banish them from the West End. Sir Harcourt! At your feet. I had hoped you would have repented. Repented. Have you not come to say it's all a jest? Say you have. No, no, no, no. Love is too sacred a subject to be trifled with. Come, let us fly! Come… See, I have procured disguises… Oh, yeah. Oh, perfect. [sil.] And for you. Oh, thank you, darling. With a beard. Oh, yes, that's perfect. Come, there's no time to lose. Come. Oh, gracious, I must return. No, impossible. But where do you intend to take me? Heaven, obviously. Come. The carriage waits. But swear, you will never desert me? Desert! No, never, never. Now, do not hesitate, flight, now, alone is left to your desperate situation! Come, every moment is laden with danger. Come. Oh! gracious! I left the… Oh, what is it now? I have forgotten… No, no, impossible. I must! I must! I have left Max, a pet stag-hound, in his basket without whom, life would be unendurable. Well, let him be sent after us in a hamper. In a hamper? Remorseless man! Go, you love me not. How would you like to be sent after me in a hamper? No, please let me fetch him. I hear him squeal! Max, Max, Max, Max… Oh, no, for the heaven's sake. They'll imagine you're calling the Squire. Oh, I hear voices, where can I retire? What's going on here then? Ravishment, violation. Elopement under the cover of darkness. I subpoena every one of you as witnesses! Where is Sir Harcourt? There bare witness. She calls on the vile delinquent for protection. Oh, protection? I'll swear before any jury. I overheard the whole elopement plan. Just give me a bible. But where is the wretched Lothario? Aye, where is the defendant? Where lies the hoary villain? What villain? Oh, no. We won't be blinded that way! I must seek Sir Harcourt, and demand an explanation! Such a thing never occurred in Oak Hall before! Now, take my advice. Mind the notes and remember your gender. Very well, now, madam, sit. Oh, yes, why not? I have procured the highest legal opinion on this subject. Thank you. Yes. And the question is resolves itself into a, what's this? A nutshell! Yes, we are in a nutshell. Now, will you, in every respect subscribe to my requests, desires, commands, orders, imperative, indicative, injunctive, or otherwise? Very good, very good. 'Pon my life, I think he means to assume the ribbons, and take the box-seat. I must put a stop to this. Mr. Spanker, I've been insulted by Sir Harcourt Courtly. He tried to elope with me. I place myself under your protection. Challenge him. I must consult my legal adviser. Ah! I smell powder! You see, it will all come to nothing Sir Harcourt would sooner rather run than dual. Command my services, my dear madam. Can I be of any use? A dual? No, impossible. Leave it to me. What has an attorney to do with affairs of honor? They are out of his element. I suggest I compromise, he could pull his nose! We have no objection to that. Yeah. Well, we have no objection either, have we? No! No. He can pull his nose that will be something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Pull his nose. Who is to do it? The plaintiff must attack the defendant. Surely, the appellant must attack the respondent. Are you questioning my legal competence sir? I'll go inside and write you something ferocious. Mr. Spanker, I am determined! I insist a challenge being sent to Sir Harcourt Courtly! And mark you, if you refuse to dual with him, I shall. Do not dual. Take my advice. Look here, Mr Meddle, unless you wish me to horse-whip you, hold your tongue. Myself retire, for now. Don't go. Sorry. Written it. It's a good end. Just respect and do me the honor of signing this here, chairman. The document is a sacred as if it were a £100 bill. So impressive. Well, by the way, where would you like this party of pleasure to come off? Open-air shooting is pleasant enough, but if I might venture to advise, we could order half a dozen of that Madeira and a box of cigars into the billiard-room, therefore make a night of it, aye, Mr. Spanker? I don't smoke. Well, does such an arrangement coincide with your views? Perfectly. Well, I trust shortly to be the harbinger of happy tidings. Lady Spanker, are you ambitious of becoming a widow? Oh, Dolly, woman is at best but weak, and weeds become me. Oh. If you become pathetic. I shall laugh. Shall laugh? You're laughing. Farewell, base, heartless, unfeeling woman! That's, so I am. Heartless, for he is a dear, good, kind little creature, and I ought not to play upon his feelings, but 'pon my life he sounds so well up at concert pitch, I'm disinclined to untune him. Oh, poor Dolly, you know, I didn't think, he cared so much for me. I going to put him out of pain, I think. Dolly, Dolly, Dolly, I'm sorry, Dolly, Dolly. [sil.] I have been a fool! A dupe of my own vanity. I shall be pointed at as a… as a ridiculous old coxcomb, and so I am. Have I been deceiving myself? Have I turned all my senses inwards looking towards self, always self? And has the world been ever laughing at me? [sil.] Well, if you have, I will revert the joke, you may say I am an old ass, but I will prove that I am neither too old to repent my folly, nor such an ass as to flinch from confessing it. A blow half met is but half felt. Sir Harcourt. Sir? May I be permitted the honor of a few minutes' conversation with you? With pleasure. Well, have the kindness to throw your eye over that. [sil.] "Situation… my life. I say, this is intended as a challenge. You see, I am perfectly aware that it is not quite up to the snuff in the writing. But I trust that the irregularity of the composition will be confounded in the beauty of the subject. Mr. Dazzle, are you in earnest? Sir Harcourt Courtly, upon my honor I am, and I hope that no previous engagement will interfere with an immediate reply in propria persona. We have fixed upon the billiard-room as the scene of action, which I have just seen properly illuminated in honor of the occasion, and, by-the- by, if your weapons are not handy, I can oblige you with a pair of the sweetest things you ever handled, hair triggered, saw grip, heirlooms in my family. I regard them almost in the light of relations. Sir, I'll avail myself of one of your relatives. And I'm happy to meet Mr. Spanker anytime or place that he may appoint. The sooner the better, sir. I see you understand these matters, my friend Spanker is woefully ignorant, miserably uneducated. Shall we? [sil.] Are you serious, uncle? We caught in the act. That monster was running off with Lady Gay, so give ye joy, girl, give ye joy. Sir Harcourt Courtly must consent to waive all title to your hand in favor of his son Charles. Oh, indeed! Is that the pith of your congratulation, the exchange of an old fool for a young one? Oh, I certainly, he is not the kind of fellow I could have chosen for my little Grace, but consider, to retain 15,000 year! Remember your father's will, if you don't Sir Harcourt, the boy gets everything. Now, tell me honestly, would you rather not have the lad, than lose the money? Why do you ask me? Why, look ye, I'm an old fellow, another hunting season or two, and I shall be in at my own death, so since your father's death and miserly will, I have yearly placed a certain sum to be yours, in a little box with my Grace's name upon it, in the event if you're refusing to fulfil the conditions prescribed. Oh, my own dear uncle! What… what… what's the matter now? Why, it was only a trifle, oh, you little rogue, what are you crying about? Nothing, but… But what? Come, out with it, will you have Young Charles? Oh! Max, Max! What's amiss with you? I'm a wicked woman! What have you done, now? Everything, I thought Sir Harcourt was a coward, now I discover a man may be a coxcomb without being coward. Just to show my husband how inconvenient it is to hold the (inaudible) sometimes, I made him send a challenge to the old fellow, and he, to my surprise, accepted it, he's about to blow my Dolly's brains out in the billiard-room, now. The devil! Just when I thought I had got my whip hand of him again, out comes my linchpin, and over I go, oh! Pert, James, I will soon put a stop that, a duel under my roof? Murder in Oak Hall! I'll shoot them both! Attend quickly, the billiard room, now. Are you really in earnest? Do you think this is some kind of joke? Oh! Dolly, Dolly, if you get shot and killed, I shall never forgive you, I know, he is a great fool, Grace, but 'pon my life, I would sooner lose my bridle hand than he should be hurt on my account. My Dolly is shot, the brute has shot him again. Look Sir Harcourt lives, he lives and Dolly is dead, so have you shot him and killed him? You horrid old brute. I shall never forgive myself. Oh! Sir Harcourt, what has happened? Your uncle interrupted us, confiscated weapons and discharged the shot, but he's so in rage Mr. Spanker, robbed as he was of the opportunity to establish his honor, that he exploded, screamed something in Danish, seized the blunderbuss from above the fire, and turned the weapon on Max and the servants, who, knowing the blunderbuss to be kept charged on account of the rats, all fled through the window. Look, look, look at the line of them there, pursued by a fully armed and rampant Spanker. Quick, take cover, they're coming this way. Everybody hide. He has only the one shot. And we can disable him. [sil.] Come along, Adolphus. There we go Mr. Spanker. Into the billiard room, shall we? That's the way. Left, right, left, right, left, right. [sil.] The country is more amusing than I had imagined. [sil.] Miss Grace. Miss Grace, to apologize for my actions were useless, more especially as I'm certain no feelings of sadness or indignation for my late acts are cherished by you, still reparation is within my power and I not only waive all my right, title or claim to your person or your fortune, but freely admit your power to bestow them on a more worthy object. This generosity, Sir Harcourt, is most unexpected. Oh, no, Oh, no, no, not generosity, no, simply justice, justice! May I still beg a favor? Claim anything that is mine to grant. You have been duped by Lady Gay Spanker, I have also been cheated and played upon by her and Mr. Augustus Hamilton, might I beg that the contract between us may, to all appearances, be still held good? Well, certainly, although I confess I cannot see the point of your purpose. Now, Grace, I have brought the lad. Oh, I, thank you, uncle, but the trouble was quite unnecessary, Sir Harcourt holds to his original contract. The deuce he does! And I am willing, nay, eager to become Lady Courtly. The deuce she is! Sir Harcourt… One word, Max, for an instant. What can this mean? Can it be possible that I have been mistaken, that she is not in love with Augustus Hamilton? Now we shall find how he intends to bend the haughty Grace. Madam, are you really in earnest, are you in love with my father? No, I am not. Are… are… are you in love with anyone else? No, or I should not marry him. Then you actually accept him as your husband? In the common acceptation of the word. Why… why do you marry him, if you don't care about him? To save my fortune. Mercenary, cold-hearted girl! Were you… were you never in love? Never! Oh! What an ass I've been! I… I… I heard Lady Gay mention something about you and Mr. Hamilton. Oh, yes, a person who, after an acquaintanceship of two days, had the assurance to make love to me, and I, uh… I… You, yes, you, well, yes, yes? I pretended to receive his attentions. It was the best pretence I ever saw. Madam, if… if the retention of your fortune be the plea on which we're about to bestow your hand on one you do not love, only know that I, and madly devotedly attached to you. You sir? Yes. Impossible. No, no, not at all, but inevitable, I have been so for a long time. But you never saw me until last night. I have seen you in imagination, you are… you are the ideal I have worshipped. Then I must confess, I do love Augustus Hamilton, but he is no more. Please, spare me, sir. She loves me! And, oh! What a situation I am in? If I own I am the man, he will overhear, and ruin me, if I do not, she'll marry him. What's to be done? Where have you put my Dolly? I have been racing all over the estate. Tell me, is he quite dead? I'll have him brought in. My dear madam, you must perceive this unfortunate occurrence was no fault of mine. I was compelled to act as I have done. I was willing to offer any kind of apology, but that resources ejected, as unacceptable. I know, I know, it was I, who made him write the letter, there was no apology needed. It was I who apparently seduced you from the paths of propriety you see, it was all a jest, and here is the end of it. Oh! If he had but lived to say, "I forgive you. Gay!" And so I do! He is alive! Oh, I shall give up hunting if you wish. Sell your stable. No, do what you like, say what you like, I have decided to abdicate. Oh, Dolly. Sir, uh… Mr. Meddle is pressing me for permission to enter. He is accompanied by new client, a gentleman by name of Solomon Isaacs. Solomon Isaacs. Where's he from? The East sir. What? Cheltenham? Not, Cheltenham, sir. Further East than that. Is he, uh… it does sound a bit, uh… Oh, definitely with a name like that must be… Does he look, uh… Don't interfere with me. What's going on here? He handled me sir. Meddle, explain yourself. I represent Mr. Solomon Isaacs, a gentleman who I met over dinner at fairies in old bury. You're the only (inaudible) around here. Pert, please. Mr. Isaacs has retained me his council. He's having failed to gain access to Mr. Charles Courtly, himself. He has (inaudible) full rights of the law. May in serving a writ. We don't need your writs, Pert, bring the fellow in. Meddle, this Solomon Isaacs, what is he? So we know. He's a money lender sir. Yeah, yeah, yes. Yes, we know he's a money lender, but is he… [sil.] Uh… Good grief, are you Solomon Isaacs? Yes, is there a problem? No. No, no. Are you, umm… Sir Harcourt, enough. Welcome sir. What's your business? Mr. Courtly? Yes. I must beg the honor of your company to town. Or take the writ and rendezvous in court at a more expensive later date. Or be arrested. Arrested? What, no, impossible. There must be some mistake. Oh, no. Not the slightest, Sir Harcourt. Judgment has been given in five cases, for the last three months, but Mr. Courtly is an eel, rather too nimble for my men. We have been on his track, and traced him down to this village, with Mr. Dazzle. Ah! Isaacs! How are you? Do you know him? Oh, intimately, I'm distantly related to his family. Uh… I knew there was some mistake! Know, to your misfortune, that Mr. Augustus Hamilton was the person you dogged to Oak Hall, between whom and my son Charles a most remarkable likeness exists. Ah, quite right. Know, to your misfortune, Sir Harcourt, that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Courtly are one and the same person! That is if the information that I have brought is the correct. Indubitably. Charles! Concealment is in vain, I am Augustus Hamilton. [sil.] No, no, no. You infernal, cozening dog! Mr. Courtly, will you accompany me? Stay sir. His father will tell you Charles Courtly is underage, so his father is liable. No, no, I won't… I won't pay a shilling of the rascal's debts, not a sixpence! Come Mr. Courtly. Daddy. If Charles Courtly will marriage, would his wife be liable? If she agreed to be his sole guarantor, yes, but that requires a legal document. Then do it. Create the document and bring it to me before dinner. Yes, madam. Mr. Isaacs, I will pay Charles Courtly's debt. I am most grateful to you Miss, but before I leave may I add that if any lady or gentleman here is covered with debts and wishes to consolidate, Solomon Isaacs, would be honor to do so, entirely free of interest for 18 months. Oh, love that. (inaudible) that after. Miss Grace, I… I think I can now, perceive the generous point of your conduct towards me and believe me I appreciate and in devour to deserve it. Come Sir Harcourt, you've been fairly beaten, you must forgive him, say you will. So, sir, it appears you have been leading, covertly, an infernal town life. Yes, I'm… I'm so sorry father. None of your humbug, sir! Oh, he is my own son, how could I expect him to keep out of the fire? And Cool, Cool! Have you been deceiving me? Yes, sir. Well, explain. I ascertain that you my master were committed to a course of self deception, and therefore as your servant, it was incumbent on me to help in this endeavour. [sil.] Well, it would be useless to withhold my hand. There, boy! What is this? What do you want? Your blessing, father. Yes, please, father. So another the mystery is being solved, you young scoundrel, you have been making love under the rose. He learnt that from you. Sir Harcourt. And what would you do now, if I were to withhold my consent? Do without it. The will says, if Grace marries anyone but you, her property reverts to your heir-apparent, and there he stands. Now, make a virtue of necessity. I married from choice, and see how happy I am. And if ever I have a son. Dolly, when we go home, you're going to having a big dose of your cure. Oh, take her, boy! Although you are too young to marry. Sir Harcourt, am I forgiven? Have you really been deceiving me? Can't you not see through this? So you still love me? As much as I ever did. [sil.] It's a very handsome ring, indeed. Very. Poor little Spanker! One point I wish to have settled. Who is Mr. Dazzle? Oh, he's a relative of the Spankers, he told me. Oh, no… Oh, no, a… a near connection of yours. Mine? No, I never saw him before I came down here, in all my life. Charles, stop that. Charles, come here, Charles, who is Mr. Dazzle? I don't know. [sil.] Dazzle, Dazzle, will you excuse an impertinent question? Certainly. Who the deuce are you? I have not the remotest ideal How, sir? Well, simple question as you may think it, it would puzzle half the world to answer. One thing I can vouch, nature made me a gentleman, that is, I live on the best that can be procured for credit. I never spend my own money when I can oblige a friend. I'm always thick on the winning horse. I'm an epidemic on the trade of tailor. For further particulars, inquire of any sitting magistrate. And these are the deeds which attest your title to the name of gentleman? Oh, sir, sir, sir, I see you have caught the infection of the present age. Charles, permit me, as your father, and you, sir, as his friend, to correct you on one point. Bare-faced assurance is the vulgar substitute for gentlemanly ease, and there are many… there are many who, by aping the vices of the great, imagine that they elevate themselves to the rank of those whose faults alone they copy. Oh, no, no, no, no! The title of gentleman is the only one out of any monarch's gift, yet within the reach of every peasant. [sil.] It should be engrossed by truth, stamped with honor, sealed with good-feeling, signed man, and enrolled in every true young English heart. A dance. [music] [sil.]
