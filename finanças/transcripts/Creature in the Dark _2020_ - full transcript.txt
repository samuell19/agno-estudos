It's okay. It's okay. Are you cold? Look, we don't have much. Okay? I'm sorry. Look, I have some food upstairs. I can get it if you want. I have a baby upstairs. Oh, that was bad. That was bad. No more going downstairs, all right? What is it? You hungry? Tired? Hungry. Okay. You're really not giving me a lot to work with here. Okay, okay, I hear you. You want some food? Look, I don't want to scare you or anything, but someone got inside. They use some type of lockpick, or it was some kind of tool. But I'm sure we can use it in some way. Look, it's gonna be bedtime after this, all right? No arguing. And maybe a story. So, as of today, we are officially two months in since the sun disappeared. It's had to have dropped, I don't know, at least another 20 degrees or so. People who are here, well, people who are still here, are starting to panic. You know, the ones who haven't already. They're all talking about going, traveling to Yellowstone. They're saying they national park's geothermal heat is the solution to all of this, but I don't know. Still doesn't really give us a solution for those things outside, that's for sure. You know, I don't know. It's only a matter of time before the sun comes back up. I mean, why wouldn't it? I don't believe all that bullshit saying, you know conspiracy theories saying something's covering the sun. I mean, that's impossible. Those videos are, they've gotta be edited. I don't know, but I guess if you would've told me, you know, a few months ago that the sun was gonna disappear then I probably woulda called bullshit on that too. You know, we're lucky. I know it doesn't seem like it, but most people didn't even know to stay away from the lights before it was too late. So we got that going for us, I guess. I don't know. I don't know when I'll be able to video again, Remember, so take care of yourself. Okay? Take care of the baby too, and keep your head up. You know, Emma's gotta be out there. We'll find her. All right. Talk soon, River. Love you. She's still asleep. What's that? Blueprints. Well, I figured that. They're building another parking garage downtown. Another one? Yup. Oh, gosh. Don't do that. Okay, jeez. I was just breathing. I knew you were gonna do that. You're making me nervous. Oh, that's pretty. What's the occasion? My mom thought it'd be pretty for the holidays. I like it. Oh, god. Come on. Go sit over there. Are you done working? Almost. Just needed to take a break. Well, come outside. I can't. I have to fold all this. It'll be here when you get back. Okay, sorry. Honey, come on, let's go outside. Hey. Hey, it's okay, okay? Come on, Mya. Hey, hey. Come on. Come on, Mya. What's that taste like? Tastes gross, doesn't it? You know what doesn't taste gross? Pizza. God, I'd love some pizza right now. You would love it. Everybody does. And root beer. I'd kill for some root beer right now. I have this cup of water, I'm gonna take a sip, and when I do, it's gonna taste like root beer. You wanna taste? Let's cross our fingers today. 104.5. Can you remember that one? We don't even have this one yet, so that's cool. I've got an idea. Let's change things up a little bit. Look at that. Look at it. Take it. River. River. Come on. It's Christmas! Emma, stop. Don't be an asshole. Come on. Come on, the baby's already downstairs. We talked about this. You promised that you wouldn't do the same thing like you did last year. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, you keep saying that, River, but if you keep doing the same things over and over again, it just doesn't mean anything. I didn't mean to fall back asleep. Yeah, well, the last present under the tree is yours. Emma, we promised we wouldn't do that this year. Yeah, well I did. You gotta keep it down, okay? I'll be fine. Just... Just a little sleep. I'll wake up tomorrow and I'll feel a whole lot better. But first things first, we gotta figure out something about where to find some food. You're not even listening to me. Okay, I'll call you back in a bit. Love you too. Bye. Well? Thank you, River. Where are you going? I told you, I have to work New Year's. Well, can't they just get someone else? I mean, I made reservations, and... What about the baby? What time are you gonna be back? Whenever they let me go. I'll call you. Okay. Love you. Love you too. You know it wasn't always like this. I think she actually liked me at one point. I am so fucking tired of this cartoon. It's not even eight. Hi, you've reached Emma Kern with city management. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you shortly. Hey honey, are you there? Look, I don't know what's going on right now. I just want to make sure you're okay. Oh, please pick up. I'll try like in a few minutes, okay? Mya? Mya? Hey, honey, it's okay. It's so cold in here, what're you doing in here? Sweetie. Come here. Oh. Oh my goodness. Are you okay? Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. Look. You okay? Oh my goodness. Hey, you okay? Silly mask, huh? This is so I don't get your germs, and you don't get mine. You're not itchy, are you? I hope not. How'd that taste? Good? Hopefully that'll help at least a little bit. So I will eat them in a box, and will eat them with a fox, and will eat them in a house, and I will eat them with a mouse, and I will eat them here and there. Say, I will eat them anywhere. I do so like green eggs and ham. Thank you. Thank you, Sam-I-Am. My mom used to read that to me all the time when I was your age. You know, I didn't even think about calling her once... Once all this happened. Emma... She reminded me a lot of her. She was just a good person. I mean, she didn't even have to try. It's just like she was born that way. And she always wanted to be a mom. You know, I would think that if she didn't have someone to share it with, then she'd explode. So I guess I'm sorry... That you had to be stuck with me. If you were with her, things would've gone differently. And someone who'd love you and... You just deserve her. I'm so sorry. God. I'm sorry. Oh, shit. Okay, just a minute, come on. How's that for good luck? I still have a few pockets to go through. Oh shit. Oh shit. Hey. Don't do that. Stop. I'll shoot. No more coughing, okay? Can you say, "Dada?" "Da-da." Hello? Hello? Hear me? Yes, I'm River Kern, I'm from Shaw. River Kern, Shaw. Well River, it's nice to finally reach someone. I'm Megan, by the way. Hi Megan. Look, I don't mean to derail anything here, but my wife, she went missing during all of this, and I was wondering if she was there with you? Her name's Emma. Emma. Let me look through our files real quick. River? Yes? I couldn't find an Emma Kern in any of our documents. I'm sorry. It's okay. Our community is still new and growing. We take in people every day. So it is possible she could have slipped by. Can you tell me a little bit more about your situation? I would love to accept you into our community, but I need a few more details. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. Wonderful. To start out, who else are you with? I'm with my daughter, and she's a little over a year now. Hey, come on. Seriously? You do not do that! Come on. Really? That's not okay. Okay? All right. Change of plans. And as New Year's Day comes to an end, the record has been broken. Over 24 hours of complete darkness. We've been working hard here at the studio ever since yesterday, and there's been absolutely no moon in the sky over here on the eastern border. Fuck, fuck, fuck! We're sorry, the number you have reached is not in service. Please check the number or try your call again. You like green beans? Any other news? Yeah, just the news we've been waiting for, actually. The transport team is getting ready to leave. It shouldn't be more than 24 hours. That's good to know. They did leave me some questions to ask you. Is that all right? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. What's the area like over there? Any looters, creatures? Well, I've had a few run-ins with a couple intruders, but creatures, I guess just one. It's down in my basement, I've been kind of studying it for a while. You have it in the basement? Yeah, why? River, you have to get it out. What? Why? The creatures communicate with one another. I'm afraid if you've had it there too long, it may have sent signals out to others. Can you get it out? I can try. Megan? It's gone River, this is great news. Are you okay? Yeah, just a little tired. Well, I checked in with the transport team about an hour ago. They're getting close. Just hang in there. You didn't touch it or anything, did you? Why? The creatures are full of bacteria we've never seen before. We're still studying them ourselves to figure out what's going on. I just don't want you to get sick or anything. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, but just out of precautionary reasons, maybe don't get too close to the baby. No skin on skin touch or anything. We've never been close. What? Nothing, we'll be ready. Hey, you. You like the suit? You want that story again? It's a good one. There are some people that are on their way that are gonna rescue you. And they can read you that book all the time. And give you everything that I never could. I'm so sorry for how I've been to you. And I hope someday you can understand that. I loved your mama so much. More than anything in the entire world. And when you came along, it was such a happy time. But Mama gave you more attention than me. I can't blame her, though. I guess I just got a little jealous. Does that make sense? I love you, Mya. Just as much as I loved Mama. I can't stay much longer. But there's something that I wanna do that I should've done more often. Megan, tell them to get ready. All right, Megan, send them in. River, what're you doing? Trust me. Trust me. Transport, River is not responding. I think he ran them off? I'll keep trying.
