No, I think it's good. But if that isn't even allowed anymore, I mean talking to each other, then it's over. Like a coffin dodger, you'll never see the sun anymore. You can knock as much as you can, no one cares. There are plenty of them. You're lovesick'? Those pigs. In public transport.. But well, I am not in pain, I don't have to starve or freeze Most humans in the world are not doing so well. Well You wanna be good for something. First, it was so thin... I want to be needed. The defecation, not fluid, but solid, but thin as earthworms. There was blood, but much later. And I say, Karl, that might be an ulcer. And he's like, no, those are just my hemorrhoids. And now, he has a stoma. The whole rectum, gone. You always have to check your defecation. Is it soft, solid or fluid. Also the colour is important. I'm a real expert. Well, I've been having pretty yellowish poop for two days. Almost like vanilla sauce, but with little globs. But now, I ask myself, if this could be pus like with my open leg. Tell me was it really that nice with your boyfriend? I mean like true love Who can witness those things, nowadays? I mean Whipped cream for a lifetime is not for you, right? But what if I'll get pregnant? A little baby from such great love? Look, my mother hates me. She was raped by some guy and then she had me. They only come to me when they are drunk as fuck.

Where you heading at? What is it? Again this strange guy with the hat. We have plenty of those guys here. They just sit in their caves, doors locked six times and leave the flat only to buy dog food.

Don't you dare to stay away. I too wanted to jump on the tracks. Kurfilrstenstrasse, we just passed it. You know what? No train showed up. I was waiting for 45 minutes. You know why?

We all know this world is reigned by idiots. Bare idiots that throw our world into chaos, but voted by 'normal' people. How is that possible, dear friends? I have two. There is just one explanation: the voters are the victims. Victims of a bunch of criminals backed by the CIA who send rays from outer space to decompose human brains. This is the truth, dear friends.

The exciting high point of every Berlin visit. A journey to Kreuzberg. SO36. There burns the airs, there are you from the socks. There is only one way to it. A trip on the metro line 1. "Take the A-train", as they say in Berlin to it. One, two, three, four: Wittenbergplatz, Nollendorfplatz Kurfürstenstrasse, Gleisdreieck Möckernbrücke, Hallesches Tor Prinzenstrasse, Kottbusser Tor Görlitzer Bahnhof, Schlesisches Tor It burns, it gleams, it stays in your head.

Take your feet from the seat, you! - Hey! - Now! How dare you! What's the matter? "What's the matter?" What a bitch! Sitting there, boozed up, full of drugs We should call the police! - Scandal. - Scandal! Get your ass from that seat! Hurry up! I would stay seated. Kriemhild! Did you hear that? What kind of person is this? Some people Maybe one of these "grey panthers". Martha, what do you mean by grey panthers? Lotti, those terrifying retirees, with their constant riots. - Well, I remember. - Rather "red panthers". - Red rats! - Red rats, good idea! Better a red rat than a brown blow fly. Agathe, did you hear that? I'm not listening to communists. Right! I won't get my hands dirty like that. If I had to choose between brown and red, the choice would be easy. Right. I am not talking about the jews. Nobody knew about that. But there were lot of positive things in the 'Third Reich'. - The Autobahn. - The Autobahn. Labour duty. Back then, you weren't bothered by antisocial subjects in the metro. I'd really like to know why this person is so run down. Perhaps because my father wasn't a Nazi. - Agathe, did you hear that? - Who was a Nazi? We've always been upright nationalists. Excuse me, your father, what kind of person was he? Sozi. Excuse me, but we also suffered under the Nazi-regime. Both of my brothers died in World War ll. If they wouldn't have voted for Hitler in '33, they might be still alive and could have enjoyed the metro ride with you today. We've survived the collapse, the 48' blockade, the Wall, the lefties and the squatters. And 35 years social democracy. So we might well survive this red pack. Well ladys, we can ignore those subjects. We are the circlets of the Reich's capital Berlin Die buttercream of cream, the queens of Tauentzien. From KuDamm to KaDeWe we are the cream in your coffee. Like 50 years ago. Like 50 years ago Our spouses were in high positions In Wehrmacht, government, justice. The government is quite generous It does not end with the grave, you see.

When I was your age the war was just over and I had only one thing in mind. It's payday, fellas! Now those brown pigs finally get their punishment. You thought so. They were soon up the ladder again. The presidents of the Employer Association, Banks, Prime Ministers. All that brown scum from then and the sleazy conservatives from now, all one spunk. Take it easy, Ma! Relax! Are you Yes? Married? Yes, yes. Very happily- And you? Yes, very happily- And how is she? Great! I mean, we go along very well. What about him? Well pretty different from you. Older. But we also go along very well. I'm still in insurance. But not in the same office form five years ago, 432, one level up. And you? Well I am still devoted to the revenue office. I still have the same boss. But in four years, he will be retired. Well I have 19 years, seven months and twelve days left. Oh Titi! Herbert please not! You know, sometimes, I have these strange dreams. It's always the same. Alfred laughs at me. Well I shout at my boss I keep shouting and shouting and he's becoming smaller. And then I say, now I get my Alfred, he'll snap you away! And then he laughs, opens the cupboard, and Alfred steps out. And then both of them laugh, loud and mean. Then suddenly, I'm naked. And both of them pull their pants down and I keep shouting, Alfred! But he's just laughing and I jump out of the window. And then I wake up, with Alfred lying next to me and everything's fine. Nollendorfplatz. Oh, I need to change for East-Berlin. Over there, people are still listening. They're just waiting for your chit chat. Easy, my boy. Take it easy and don't forget to relax. Well, /..., well G 'day! Horst. Well, /..., well Would you mind me disturbing you for a second? You might think I belong to this mean pack Who casually flirts with every girl in the metro or anywhere But I'll be the last one To flirt with a girl just because she is cute Isn't he sweet? But - Say nothing! At second glance we might be down with each other A smile, bad pick-up lines, an accidental touch and quickly we're off Cafe', a walk in the park, cinema, disco, kissing in front of the door Warmth, illusions, projections, dimensions is what you want Rotations, electrons, collisions, quadrophony Chromosomes, silicones, frustrations, depressions Confessions, traditions, confessions, traditions, Erections, erections, erections, erections Loneliness, wine and beer Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? - But listen - Say nothing! Just imagine, after six weeks, everything's well established We chatter and eat, sleep together Everything seems to be just fine The glitter's gone, frustration's near All the sparkles turn to mold Money, love, dishes, nothing but beef - But it's just normal - Wait a sec... One lies, the other suffers, one screams, the other's still 'Cause feelings are never clear Another six month in vain False concerns and all that stuff Suddenly a break, end, out of contempt Hate, so freezingly cold, it makes you shiver You'll shiver You're numb, dead, empty Worse off than before And lost so much valuable time - But well no - Did you just say something? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? Isn't he sweet? - Hey, Maria! - What are you doing here? I've lost my bag. What? Where have you last seen it? At Bahnhof Zoo, at the snack stall. Well? You've been there? I haven't seen you there. There was this dickhead. He put something in my coffee. This only happens to villager gals like you. I am going back to Bahnhof Zoo, are you coming with me? I am very disappointed from you. I feel so sick. Damn city! Nothing but weirdos! You wanna go back home, to mommy and daddy? Sure, I am coming with you! Hey! You're the singer from this morning! Hey, you're that cutie who's looking for Johnny! Her Prince Charming. You mean the one form this lady, right? Lady? Not with me! Get it? Who is talking to you? What kind of lady? Johnny's girlfriend. She's a super rich real estate agent, she's crazy for young musicians. Who am I? You little wanker! I can live without your fucking low-pub. Bravo! What did they do to you? Back in the days did everything for him. - This criminal! - Right. And you're a singer? How do you become one, anyways? No clue. I used to be a social worker but I quit. It was crap. You know what? I think that's bullshit! Yes, me too! But you know what? All this trouble with these kids who'll never do a thing on their own, except stealing, smoking. And you run after them, to their parents, the police, the court and in the end, they thank you with lies and insults. "It's pointless, anyways." "I'll just throw myself in front of the metro!" But not with me. But you can't just leave them alone. Well sure, I can. I am not that stupid guy who's rolling a doodah up the hill. - Sisyphos. - Really? I'd be happy having such a job. And not all kids are the same. Anyways, I've spent a year traveling around the world. - Alone? - Sure thing! There are two billion men in the world. Why do some guy at home? Why isn't this opening? Hey, what's happening? Every time during rush hour. As if they needed an audience. Don't go! Maybe it's just a bag on the rails. - Do you really believe that? - Stop freaking out! Look! The hat! Hi... I was worrying about you. Well, my farewell would be sophisticated. - Sorry. - Believe me! Wait a second. Shitty moment for a flirt Well, she brought us together, right? Please stay. Damn, how I'd like to thank you Shit! I don't get it! Why is she doing that all of a sudden? Feels like one of her jokes Everything was fine! I've said to her, she could stay with me. Damn Kleister, it wasn't your fault! She had so many other problems. How could you let her die if you know so well about her problems? - You're just another government official! - Not anymore! I know you! Talking shit is the only thing you do. The squares are happy. Now she lies there. One less, right?! I have something for you. She yanked that off from me, this dumb bitch. Fuck off, you pigs! Wanker! Kleister, don't act like the Allies! Is this from you? How do you know him? How can you get so wasted? Wasted? That's easy. Get wasted, that's the easiest thing to do. She did never obey A miscarriage from the beginning A scandalous consumer A pain for all officials Her craze for freedom was a crime Thank god, for our thick fur Thank god for our thick skin She was living like a leaf in the wind Credulous like a child She didn't give a damn about Work Making out was her life goal Her craze for love was a crime Thank god for our thick skin Thank god for our thick skin She didn't know what to do The best was not good enough for her The miserable world made her suffer You can't imagine Her craze for compassion was a crime Thank god for our thick skin Thank god for our thick skin She just left for good Without saying goodbye She was roaming around before Never asked where Her whole life was shit She was longing for something eternally wonderful But where might she find that? Again it's colder Sometimes it's pretty hard But leaving just like that It's not the way She was hopeless, from the beginning. That's not true. That's never true. Life means hoping till the end Hoping for love, a little piece of luck Everything could happen It could happen today A word, softly whispered A big bang or a little wonder Hope is eternal And can always be fulfilled Oh yeah! That's bloody, bloody insane! Always be fulfilled Wow! - Are you worried about something? - No! Well, you think about something. No, what the heck should it be? Well that's what I am asking. There's nothing, and over! You don't want to tell me. Now he has to pull the gun. There is nothing, really. Enough. - Is it because of me? - No! Wrong! Then what? See! I am fine, don't worry! Stop lying, you coward! You just confessed! What did I do? That there is something but not because of me. "But not because of me". Wonderful! Say, why are you following me the whole day? Me I write stories, nothing special. And when I saw you, my fantasy suddenly exploded. Well, didn't seem to be enough for hitting on her. Well, I mean I tried. Like that Reality can be disappointing at times. I'm sorry for you but there is nothing! Why so aggressive? I am not aggressive! Well? You don't love me anymore. Wonderful. It has nothing to do with it. - Why are blushing? - Are you craze or what? Well, talk to her! Instead of staring at her buttocks like a carp with his mouth open. - Who? - Well stop acting. You mean her? You must have lost your mind. First, I looked somewhere else and second C'mon! Just flirt with her! There's nothing to it! But then own it, loser, instead of slobbering like a voyeur and lying all the time. Nice, right? Finally something happened. Super dive on the metro rail. And lots of bug-eyed corpses. All of them died a 1000 times more than the mashed body on the rail. Boy, you're whacked out of your skull! Every week there's shit like this happening. And now the day's just ruined for everyone. Just waiting all day long, too late for work, too late at home. - That's the deal! -Indeed. Good for you! That's a good reason to booze up before all that. You just bore yourself to death anyways! And you both, doesn't matter where you scratch your eyes out. Well, he's right. Evelyn, please! Evelyn, please! And all because of these drugheads. Hey Folks, she was no addict. But? She was love sick. Or maybe she was desperately looking for a job. You crazy or what?! Her whole life, Lumpi was never looking for a job. And why did she kill herself so cruelly? Such a young person. Well, to shock us! See, now we are sitting here, talking about her. She'll be happy watching us from above. No way! What do we have to do with the death of a drug addict? I'd like to know that. You're addicted yourself, you pill-snipe! Back off! Right now! Or do you want to witness a murder? Rampage! Tosser! Grain-shitter! What's the matter? The cold is creeping in And loneliness Poverty and disgust Fear and suffering Rockets and plagues Venom at the pole Wealth of the wealthy And Kohl's grin Like calves we're let to the slaughter bank Scoffed and derided and nothing ever changes Nothing! Nothing ever changes! Bloody madness! I must be dreaming. Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream Courage to dream There is only one salvation. Fight the monsters! Free metro rides! Hi. - Hi. - Hi. My friend Corpse. Say hello to Corpse. Look in his beautiful eyes! Nice! You see, she's nice to you! Leave me alone!
