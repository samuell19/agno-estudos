I am lonely, a feeling only for the strong "Life is a match" - Rikidozan That was the Ebihara Ichiro Band! Now, ladies and gentleman It's time to swing! That lady over there... Looks like our bandmaster has the hots for you! Want some bedtime music? Ladies and gentlemen! You would not believe who just showed up at our club! The great Rikidozan! Look. It's Rikidozan! - Mr. Rikidozan! Please say a few words to our audience! No. - Would you please? There's a mob hit man in this club. I can see you don't believe me. I have heard that clubs like this contain at least one man who can easily kill me. I have something to say in case any of you sees him. Tell him that if he wants to kill me, to challenge the greatest fighter, then he better get a ticket... anyone with a ticket is welcome. See you in the ring! What's going on...? What the hell is going on... RIKIDOZAN No flames, no clouds... No wind or waves. The Yellow Sea was calm... then clouded over. It must be thunder... or lightning over water. The skies are ablaze... the sun and sky all cloudy. Lights out! Lights out! Thank you for the lesson. You worm! I wish you were dead! Go back where you came from! Die, you Korean! - Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Get out of here! - Thank you. Eat shit and die! Thank... you... Still grateful? Then here's more! Are you OK, Kim? This is too much... If I were you, I'd have run away. Kim... Let's get out of here. It can't be any worse than here. Hamayu... I've nowhere to go. I can't... I can't face my mom like this. I can't let her down. Just go to bed. Thank you for the lesson, sir! You knew Hamayu was going to run way? No, I didn't. You can leave, too. I'm giving you a chance. I will not, sir! Bastard! Get out! - I will not leave, sir...! I will become a yokozuna! What? What will you do if you become yokozuna? I will smile all I want! So, you want to smile? You know what? I really hate a smiling Korean! Out of the way! Coming through! Air raid! - Run! Into the shelter! Hurry! This way, please. Thank you. Are you all right? It hurts. I'm sorry... Aren't you a wrestler at the Nishonoyama? I've seen you before. What's your name? Kim! That's what they call me. Where are you from? Far away. Just like me... I'm from far away, too. Do you know Nagasaki? Your name is...? It's Aya. - Aya... You know Chairman Mr. Kanno... Thanks to his support... I'm able to learn and play music at the geisha house. It's good. Actually, it's kind of spicy. We have prepared this feast for Azumanami's ascension to yokozuna... and the formation of his sponsorship committee. Enjoy the evening! Now... I propose a toast, for the Azumanami our newest yokozuna (Sumo Champion)! Cheers! - Cheers Aren't the geisha's here splendid? Indeed. Pour me more. Lucky bastard! Azuma's just got really lucky! You should get an official rank and a sponsor, too. Idiot! Do you know how hard it is to get a sponsor like Mr. Kanno? Hey, Kim! Mind if I rescue you from boredom? Pick it up! What did you just say? Pick it up, you bastard! How dare you! I'm your senior! I said, pick it up! You scumbag! You won't get away with this! I'll cut you if you don't shut up! Look... It's hard enough without you around. Must you give me a hard time like that? It was... a prank. A friendly joke` You listen to me good... Leave me alone! Good-bye, sir! Kim! Who the hell is Kim? It's... It's me, sir... What's the matter? - You thief! You stole this, didn't you! We found this in your locker! You're a Korean, aren't you? I didn't do it! It wasn't me! The hell you didn't! You better start talking! What's going on here? I didn't do it! - You stop there! Stop there! Stop! - Out of the way! I said stop! Stop right there! What's going on? Get him! Out of the way! Kim! Stop running! You'll never wrestle if you keep running. You must go to the station. I didn't steal anything. I may be from Korea but I'm no thief! I am a sumo wrestler! Mr. Kanno! I didn't steal anything! All I want to do... is wrestle. To wrestle! Buttons on the red-blooded soldier... dropping away like sakura blossom... as he flies over the beach this day. The great cloud of hope appears inside. The arms of a mighty pilot... ...are stronger than steel... And his heart is on fire... Mr. Kanno... We march, we march... into enemy lands... Open it. It is a name you must carry for eternity. Rikidozan! Now you are officially a sumo wrestler! If there is something you want I will give it to you. Speak, before I have a change of heart. Sir... What is it? I want Aya. Aya? You want Aya? Off with you! Wait! Why did you call for me? What do you mean, sir? There were many people on the bridge. At least 50. Of all those people, why me? Why not your master? You stood out from the rest... I don't understand... I was scared as hell bringing those cops here. I mean, they shot at you. I did what you asked me to, but wasn't it a bit too dangerous? What if Mr. Kanno just left? Then what? Well, sir... I was just testing my luck. Sumo is the Way to Power Tell me why! Please, Riki! Calm down! Mr. Rikidozan! - Please control yourself! Please control yourself! - Please! Why am I not on the roster? You... you know the answer to that! I'm sorry but let's call it a day. Take care, now. What are you doing? Cutting this damned topknot off! No! No, you can't! - Let go! Give me the knife! Out of my way! Listen to me! Have you forgotten your dreams? I miss my mother... Because of this... I've wasted ten years of my life I just can't stand it! Aya... What will I do now if not sumo? Things will be fine. My dear... All will go well. Don't worry. You will do fine... Rikidozan. It was not an easy decision! A year's suspension is very lenient considering what you did! Do you think this matters to me now? You're not a sumo wrestler without it! You will be nobody if you don't have it! Nobody... like a 'Korean', right? My apologies, gentlemen... Good... Go and take better care of yourself now. You really thought I'd apologize? G... Get out! That's it! You're finished! The nerve...! No more! Kanno or no Kanno! Lowlife fool! Ungrateful idiot! - What nerve...! W... What the...! Easy now...! I sacrificed ten years of my life for this damned thing! But no more! I, Rikidozan... will go... my own way! Are you ok? Of course! Who am I? Stop talking nonsense and bring some more meat! Yes, it's fine. By the way, how's going with the war? Don't know. Everyone says different story. We don't need to worry. What am I doing? Nearly forgot. Where are you? Hair... It's the letter from home. It took 4 months. Well... What's with big bro? He sent me a letter? Must be good news! What is it? Huh? My mother... passed away. What? Myoung-Gil My mother... passed away. Give me more! Sir, I think you've had enough... What? Hey! I'm not a 'sir'. I'm Rikidozan! You should be more careful. Unless you want to face the Kousei Family. How dare a yakuza bum threaten me? We don't need any trouble, sir. Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! You dare... ...to threaten me! What the...? That's enough. OK. I'll stop. You bastard! Ouch! All right! I'll stop! You're big. Are you a sumo wrestler? The hell with you! My name is Harold Sakada professional wrestler. Come to my gym when you come to your senses. The nerve...! You're dead meat! Where is Sakada? Hey, sumo wrestler! You don't need all that to wrestle. Just to let you know I fight to the death. Come on then! Son of a bitch! I'll show you what pro wrestling is all about. Riki... Sumo is a sport for Japan only. But there's a sport for the entire world... and that's pro-wrestling! Sir... What's the bike for? Exercise. I have to move my body while I still can. Otherwise, I'll regret later. Riki... Looks like you could use a good barber. Sir... I need a favor. Who did you hit this time? No one, sir. My entire life may depend on it. Sir... send me to America. What? I would like to take up western wrestling. I understand. It's good that you want to try something new. But Riki... Aren't you a bit old to start something new? Are you sure you won't give up? Pro wrestling is a global sport. My race and country do not matter. Life is short, and I have wasted half of it. I want no regrets for the rest of my life. I just can't end it here. Not like this! It's not fair! Please help me! Please sir... Help me make it. Stop drinking on an empty stomach. Food's almost ready. Aya... I'm going to America. What did you say? I'm going to America. There's a western sumo called 'pro-wrestling'. I'm taking it up. How long will it take? A year or two? Five or ten? I don't know. Actually, to be frank... I'm not coming back until I succeed. Oh, not again...! Now, where's that candle? I came to Japan ten years ago. Now it's America. I probably won't get another chance. The candle should be here somewhere... You can leave me if you want. I don't care. I'll get myself an American girl. You get yourself another guy. Tell me I can do it. Don't be silly. All will go well. I know you can do it. Aya. I am training unbelievably hard. Write back, silly. You know writing is hard for me. Aloha! I wish my horse was as good as he is! I hope you are well. I am doing fine. I pray for your health always. Aloha! Can I help you sir? - Nothing Can I help you with anything? Nothing Mind if I ask for an autograph? You know me? You're a bit young for a sumo fan. But aren't you the Rikidozan The pro-wrestler? That's me, all right. 'Rikidozan, professional wrestler' Riki, want to know the fastest way to get rich? There's a secret? What is it, Yoshimachi? Tell him. To be rich, you have to spend less, and earn more. This is Yoshimachi. He will help you from now on. Yoshimachi, say hello. How do you do? I've always wanted to meet you, Mr. Rikidozan. My pleasure. The pleasure is all mine. How does it feel to be back? Feel anything different? Dear... Do you love me? Do you truly love Aya? Do you like Audrey Hepburn then? - Yes. Oh, you...! Let me off! Nothing's changed. You must be hungry. I will fix you dinner. What's wrong? Sorry but I'm not coming in. I feel I won't be able to come back out This is your home - I know, but... I saw something amazing in the U.S You know what I saw? I ran all day long... And didn't even see one person It's such a big country. I liked it The next day, I caught a fever That moment, a thought came to me. Aya I'm really sorry but I'm not coming in. I don't know what you've seen. I'm not sure either. But I bet it's something big? Dear. Wherever you are and Whatever you do... Don't forget our home is here. That there's a home waiting for you. Please don't forget. It's too early. People in Kansai don't even know what pro-wrestling is. Rikidozan only made it to the fourth rank in sumo! He just does not have the name recognition! Unless he is Imura the Judo Champion. Imura, you say? The five-time champion of the Grand Judo Tournament! The greatest Judoka ever! That Imura! We might consider it for Imura. Of course! That's enough now. Well... I heard you loud and clear. Then we will take a vote. All those who are for pro-wrestling, raise your hands. Rikidozan's pro-wrestling? Yes. Pro-wrestling by Rikidozan. That won't work. Lastly... Now we will hear someone who says pro-wrestling... must come to Japan. Come in! Gentlemen... Please look around you. The war may be over... but there is fear in our eyes when we look upon an American. When did Japan fall into such weakness? These are not the eyes of the young men who died in Manchuria... the Philippines, and in the Pacific. for my benefit alone. I am not bringing pro-wrestling I want to show the children of Japan... a man who can stand up and fight the big and bad white men. Please look not at me but at my true intentions.

Rikidozan Makes Movie Debut Wrestling is the Latest Rage Watch Pro-Wrestling at Home Rikidozan:The People's Hero Twenty-one Straight Sellouts I got a shot! How do I look? You look great. Look at you! Can't you wear something better? Mr. Rikidozan! Your Highness... This is Toyonobori... Endo Kokichi... and this man is Rikidozan. So this is the hand that defeated those America giants. It is an honor, Your Highness. It is an honor to see you. What do you think? - It's great! Endo was a judoka. Is that all you can do? Enough! Do it like this! Please excuse me... That is quite enough. I said that's enough! - It's not even half over. Rikidozan! I said stop! No. I'm not even half done yet. Permission to enter Mr. Kanno... Isn't that seaweed? It's not just seaweed. It's medicine. Would you like some? - No, thank you. I trust in western medicine, and nothing else. Oriental is better. Riki, do you know what's considered most valuable in men? I may not know how many people... would give up their life for you. But I strongly believe there are many... who would die for me. Trust is what matters. Trust is never easy to get back once you lose it. Always keep that in mind. Want to try some? - I'm fine, thank you. I only trust Western medicine. Come on, Nakajima! You can do it! One more step! Are you all right, sir? Yes. I'm fine. Don't worry. Maybe it wants to be paid like an actor. One more time! I'd be dead if it hit me... No. Some tried to kill me. I'm taking it now. Out of the way! Good! Look at the camera... Here goes. One, two... Sir! Try lifting her up, would you? Well, excuse me then... Yes, madam. You make a great couple! Where do I unhook it? Right here. Who is it? Never mind that. - Wait... Who is it? I am sorry, sir. But I must speak with you. Here... Imura Challenges Rikidozan. Says Riki's wrestling is fake Are you all right? Sir... I cannot let this pass. You fool! Look at yourself... There are things that you must let slide. Don't just think of yourself. Look at the big picture. How about three fights? Tokyo, Osaka, and Hakata. You'll get to win the last fight. No matter what... Japanese pro wrestling is Rikidozan's wrestling! No. It is my wrestling! You haven't been yourself... since you started taking all that western medicine. I meant no disrespect. But please remember, the people Who come to see wrestling... who come to see wrestling come for Rikidozan. Where are you going? The nail that sticks out receives the first blow. Yoshimachi? - Sir? What do you think? I am sure he won't disobey you. A normal fool would. But that is no normal fool. Be prepared, because it will get tougher for you. Rest assured, sir. I thought we could be good partners... But since it has come to this I accept his challenge. Mr. Imura says that wrestling is a show and no sport... that he was beaten up according to a script last time. Do you think wrestling is just a show? Not all of it... but... Please step out. Dear reporters... Every sport has rules. Calm down, everyone! Look here... Your bones will snap if this bends more than 1 5 degrees. We have our rules... just as boxers use boxing gloves. Do you get it? Are you all right? Fine! I don't care if he's the god of judo! Let's see who fights better! You have come. You know Imura already... Come and take a seat. Who is it? It's me. Kim Shin-rak. Shin-rak? Eat up. - Close the door. Are you ready for the fight? No problem there... It's just that I have no one around me I can trust. My boss, my students, my wife... Well, then... You won't be back any time soon. I will. I'm going home, Shin-rak. I've signed on to the repatriation project to North Korea yesterday. Guess this is my last bulgogi! Now that it's out, I have something to tell you. Isn't it time to say that you're Korean? What did Korea ever do for me? O.K. If I had stayed home... I'd have ended up cannon fodder In the Korean War. My only choice would have been whether the bullet in my head... was American or Russian or... Even then, I probably wouldn't have had a choice. Japan, Korea... who cares about all of that? I'm Rikidozan, and I belong to the world. You will die a lonely man, then... Who isn't alone? Thanks for the meat... It's Rikidozan against lmura... A battle to decide who is the best fighter in all of Japan! And here they go! Will it be lmura, the god of Judo? Or will Rikidozan come out on top with his karate chop? Imura gets the upper hand with his judo techniques. Imura seems to be in good condition. It looks like Rikidozan is losing to lmura! Imura gets three-count! What's wrong, Riki? Rikidozan goes on the attack! They are engaged in a test of strength! The air is so tense you can feel it! They're at it again! Oh no! Rikidozan takes hit to the crotch. Imura gets a warning from the ref. Riki's launches a surprise attack! Rikidozan is furious! Stop him. Referee! The match has just gotten rougher... and rather one-sided. This is no match. This is pure brutality There's blood everywhere. Imura is down! This is a contract for a draw signed by Imura himself. Imura acted like a coward. He had gangsters threaten me so he could get his draw. The draw contract was a scheme designed to ruin me! A scheme? We can't just let him go! Please let me... - No! The result is what matters! Winners make history. That's what competition is. Mr. Kanno wants you to go back. Do you think I'm bad, Yoshimachi? No, sir. But... I had doors slammed in my face all my life. They would tell me to stop that I should keep my place... and be good. But life is much too short to pretend to be good. Don't you agree? You may go home. I will stand by you, sir. - Go. That's an order! Isn't it your son's birthday? How did you know? I know everything. Got that? Everything... Now, go... Do you want the card? Yes, I'll Did you write something funny? Yes, but I don't know about my son. What did you write? Happy birthday! Life is only one time experience. Don't pretend! Pretend not to be... Nice? Yes. Pretend not to be nice! Is Rikidozan still outside? Yes, sir. What should we do, sir? Imura will not stand for this. Rikidozan still belongs to me. Tell them... if they do anything to Riki they will have to answer to me. That it is not negotiable. Yes, sir. But... Wakayama... Rikidozan has grown beyond us. If we want blood, it should be in the ring. Have you decided on a finishing move, yokozuna? Azumanami Wrestling Debut Press Conference It will be, 'The Mask Ripper'. And don't forget the three count! Don't wipe it. Get the reporters in here. You're hurt badly. You must get treated first. So send them in quickly! Sir. You must get treatment. I'll take care of the reporters. Please get it looked at. Please! Please sit down. Please... - Out of the way! Azumanami just made his debut... and the reporters went there. It's Rikidozan! Gentlemen... I see Mr. Rikidozan is here to congratulate Azumafuji's debut... into the pro-wrestling world. I heard you were a big fan of his when you were sumo wrestling. Yes. Azumanami bought me stew and noodles many times. So all you remember is eating? Azumanami was born in Tokyo. And he won the sumo championship. He may become a bigger star than Rikidozan. Be good to me, Riki. There's no need for that. Wrestling is a sport where you stand by yourself. You all heard him... Well, even the great Rikidozan seems scared of the yokozuna. Yokozuna or whatever... no one with a big, fat belly can become a great wrestler. Oh, boy...! Looks like your senior wrestler... is giving you lesson in discipline already! You better watch out. Please go easy on me, teacher. Smaller than I thought. There's nowhere to run to, here. Rikidozan... So you asked for my shares. What will you do for me in return? I will give you my life. I don't need it... Sing for me, will you? Sing...? Which song? How about an army song? A river ofyoungblood flows... I, too, ran across bridges when I was young... just like you did to survive. I always think back to those times whenever I see you... and I liked it. And I'm always grateful for that. But you made enemies... out of too many people. I want pro-wrestling for Japan itself... not just for Rikidozan. I am sure Azumanami can maintain the popularity... of pro-wrestling after you. Are you telling me to retire? As you say... the ring is only big enough for one hero. I will arrange an honorable retirement for you. Sir... A hero never retires. There is no shame in a samurai Laying down his sword... after losing an arm. If you do, all my shares will be yours. Satisfied? Help yourself... - Thank you. When was that picture taken? He looks very young in there. How was he when he was young? Filthy... Yes, I was. - Sir! Not as filthy as now. So what do you want? Go back to the good old times? Give up wrestling and live happily ever after? Is that it? I would if I could... I really would. Kanno told me to go back to myself. Are the two of you playing with me? Huh? Is that it? So that is it! Return to the good old days... Oh no... We have no place to go back to now... Sir, calm down. - Back off! Where's my medicine? Get me my medicine! Where's my medicine, Aya? I threw it away. What? I threw them all away. Now I know what really is in your heart. One false step and we're back doing the same crap. Is that what you want? You can't! Why are you doing this? Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! I mean the great Rikidozan. Congratulations! Stop being silly. "Rikidozan Receives Medal from Red Cross" What's wrong? Let's have a party tonight. Yes! Can the wrestlers drink, too? Of course. - Thank you! Sir...? Sir...? Someone get a doctor! Sir...! How is he? What did the doctor say? Well, you see... - What is it? He didn't want anyone to know. Not even the doctor. Call a doctor and say I called him. Hurry! Yes, ma'am. Do you want some water? How long was I asleep? Very long. I had this dream. I know. Did you see your mother? Was she well? You know, holding your hands reminds me of the old days. I saw the paper, too. So Azumanami is going to wrestle, too. And like always you will try to beat him. But my dear I have one thing to ask you. No... Anything but leaving me... Please say it one more time... that all will go well. Please say it. No. I don't want to lie anymore. Then what is it that you want to say? Please back down... and accept defeat just this once. What's happening to Rikidozan? He's getting pummeled. It is an unlikely scene for a champion! Rikidozan is helpless! Off the ropes! He must be hurting. Just what is going on with Riki? He's using the chair! This is too much! Riki is almost out of it. Such treachery! It's painful just watching him. Atomic is biting into Riki's face! Just what is going on with Riki? Azumanami is in the ring! Just look at Azumanami! He is taking revenge for Riki! Wait. That's a sumo technique! Azumanami is having a very successful debut. The Yokozuna Tackle! He attacks with his body! Will the yokozuna conquer the wrestling ring as well? He pins his opponent. Azumanami wins! He's the champion! Riki is getting destroyed as soon as he comes out! Atomic is manhandling Riki! It's a repeat of the first bout. Atomic is chewing on his face again! This is a shocker, folks. It is utterly shocking to see Rikidozan being destroyed. Riki fails to make the tag and is dragged back. He is bleeding profusely. This is terrible! How could Rikidozan fall like this? Please lose a match for me... Please... Just one match... Get up, Rikidozan! You can't lose! Come on, Rikidozan! Fight! Rikidozan is fighting back! He looks stronger than ever! Multiple karate chops! Where did he get his burst of power? I have come with seaweed for Mr. Kanno. It tastes bitter today. Why didn't you lose? I apologize... but I couldn't get used to the idea of losing. Did you not say... you would consider the future of Japanese pro-wrestling? Sir... I felt that Azumanami had to lose for the good of pro-wrestling. Pro-wrestling still needs Rikidozan to get into the ring to bleed... to fight, and to win. Now I know what you want. From now on... our relationship is finished. But I will not take personal revenge upon you. Mr. Kanno! It's over! We will no longer meet ever again. You stupid idiot! Kim-il! What happened? My timing was off! We have to go now. Wait! You can't stop broadcasting wrestling. It was pro-wrestling that saved Japan TV. There is nothing I can do. Everyone's talking about baseball these days. And then there's the Olympics next year. I'm sorry... Sir... Olympics, dullimpics! Next year, 5,500 people From 94 countries... will be our competition. Yoshimachi... Why are you still here? Didn't you already finish what Mr. Kanno sent you to do? So, you knew. - Of course. But you don't know why I haven't left? I'm not sure myself. Well, maybe I'll give you a chance... to fight the world's greatest wrestler sometime. Wait! What are you doing? I think I'm starting to hate wrestling now... Hey! You bit me! - I'm sorry... I'm a cheater by nature. Then I'm the foul king! May I help you...? Do you live here? Yes. Why? I... used to live here. What? I don't anymore... but I used to a long time ago. Well, I'm busy right now... Sorry... Try to eat more. Who was that? - No one special. Strange... I keep wanting to go outside today. Strange... It's very strange... Don't sleep... Come dance with me. Hey, you! Riki is mine! Let's dance! - I'll give you chocolate. Dance! - Chocolate! You'll dance, won't you? OK! - OK? He's dancing. Yes! I'm sorry... You! Why are you grinning? I am a big fan of yours... Who hired you? Let me go. You're here to kill me, right? Damn! How stupid of me...! It hasn't snowed in a while. Who did this to you? I, Kimil, will find him and kill him! Are you all right, sir? Idiot! Kim-il... Back in my hometown, people would smile a lot. My mother cracked a lot of jokes, too. But here, there was nothing to smile and laugh about The Japs would think a Korean must crazy... To walk around smiling when There was nothing to smile about. So I thought I had to make it big, so I could smile. I thought I could smile all I want by making it big. I would be the one who laughs the most in all of Japan. But until that day came I would not smile or cry. When I get out, I will build the Rikidozan Recreation Center. In Ginza there will be a building which I've built And that building will have the biggest billboard in Japan Then they will know that I lived my life smiling all I want even after my death. Sir... Right... Everything starts over, now! Rikidozan died from peritonitis one week after the stabbing. Aya died soon after his death. Come on.... hurry! Come. Please walk faster. Why are we doing this? It's not even New Year's. So what if it's not? Come on! Let's make a wish. A man's dreams don't come true by praying at places like this. I bet you want to be yokozuna, right? How many times do I have to tell you? Not just any yokozuna. Yes. I know. The greatest yokozuna ever, right? What did you pray for? I'm not telling you! Would you do me The honor of taking a picture... with a yokozuna? Smile. I need a bigger smile. Here goes! One, Two, three!
