I haven't seen you in three weeks, and how many packs have you smoke since then? You could've triggered a forest fire. It's been three weeks and you're still an asshole. I just saved you from many sickness. Did you even take look at the pictures they put on the boxes? You know the only sickness you get from smoking cigarettes? - What? - Heartbreak. Because you're being a hypocrite. So now you're an ustadh, preaching to me about hypocrisy? You said it yourself. Smoking is bad for your health. It can triggers many sickness. But you know what, the government still allows them to produce, and sell cigarettes. So what's the difference? So you're telling me that the govermnent is hypocrite... and corrupt for taking corporate money and giving us high taxes? I've heard that before, Jonny. Remember when you said we love being enslaved by the government. What did you call it back then? Sodom and sausage? - Masochism. - Yeah, that. Let's go. You think I paid those cigarettes with dirt? Let's get back to work! It's been too long. So I have to push the car again, huh? Guys, help me push the car! I gave him three weeks to fix the car, and he just burned the money. Come on! Release the handbrake! I have news for you. This will be my last job. I want to retire. I want to quit doing this kind of job. Retire? You got rich from gamble? Got lots of money? Not everything is about money, dude. And how do you earn your living? I don't know, doing business perhaps? Any legal business. Give me one example. Are you thinking about catfish farming? Why not? Stop bullshitting me. I know how much money you've got. I don't want to see Mercy suffering. Suffering because of what? You know, if she had to quit university because his brother can no longer pay for her tuition. What does my sister have to do with my retirement? Nothing. I just miss... I'm warning you, don't ever mess with my sister. I'll put a hole in your head before you finished thinking about dating her. Get it? I don't want her to know what we do for a living. - Who's our target today? - About that... In this digital era... our employer is still giving us details in physical file folders. What a boomer. Our next target's name's Jonathan... he's a professional scam artist. He's basically worse than me. His criminal record is so disgusting he deserves to die. Killing him would be our service to the world. Our cover today is as census officers. Morning. We're from Census Bureau. How many people are in the house? It's is for health survey. Swine flu is spreading throughout Asia... and Indonesia is one of them. - Swine flu? - Yes... it's a disease initially found in swines... and contracting human who ate them... especially people with big bodies. Are you saying I look like pig? Take it easy, Sir. No need to get angry. Too long. Clear. This house is tall. Apparently they had a party last night. Wake him up. Morning, sunshine. I think we got he wrong person. You said your name is Lukman? How much do you weigh, Sir? I'm 165 kg, but last year I was 17... Jonny. Only answer the question, okay, Mister Way Kambas Elephant? - Do you know this person? - It's too close, I can't see. It's too close, Jonny. Is this you? That's not me. Criminals never confess their crimes. You look like a dirty bureaucrat. Are you a dirty bureaucrat? I'm a businessman. I own 12 hotels... 24 factories... and five TV stations. So you involved in black campaign for certain party benefit? That's not regular business. That's a big business. - Who hires you to kill me? - Don't you dare to... Jonny... Do you have a picture of a younger you? There. Apparently he has a wife and a child. Where are they now? We got divorce. Because you kept cheating on her? Can't keep it in your pants? It's in the third floor, my room. Where's Lukman? He's downstairs, chatting with us. May I know what's your name? Anita. Sir. Can you uncuff me? Where's the key? Inside that glass. Do you live here too? - Yeah. - So you know his real name. Lukman is his real name. Not Jonathan? No. Where does he keep more pictures of him? Check that wardrobe. How old are you? I'm 34 years old. Are you his new wife? Soon to be. Why? You sound interested in me. No reason. I'm just friendly, it's in my nature. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. I'm just doing my job. Jonathan Setiawan. Aka. Anita. As the punishment for your crimes by conning people... being a homewrecker... mastermind of many kidnaps and murders... and many scams... You deserve to die. No, please. I can pay you three times higher than your client offered to you. That's not how I play the game. The chick? - What's that? - That's Anita's birth control pills. Nope. Those are estrogen pills. Usually taken by women who are in their menopausal age or transgenders. It can't be! It can't be, Anita! It can't be! Well, Mister Way Kambas Elephant, apparently he tricked you with his new look! - As usual. - Okay, Jon. Hey, sons of bitches! Do you know who I am? You're a billionaire. But surprisingly your debts are everywhere. You work for dirty politicians... enslaved by the oligarchy. Fuck you! Jonny! You owe me one. I feel refreshed. Thank you. Hello, sis. I woke up this morning and you've already gone. We didn't get a chance to talk much last night. I have to work. Happy birthday, my brother. Is it today? Oh, yeah. Thank you. I wish Mom and Dad were still alive. They must be so proud of you. Then finish your school. I have a gift for you. What gift? I don't want any gifts. My phone is still working perfectly. It's not a phone. Then what is it? I don't need any surprises. You have to come. I'll share the location, and you need to be there or else. Okay, fine. Thank you my gorgeous and kind brother. I love you. Frank! Jonny. Cool, huh? It's coffee time, Jonny. Let's go! Are the jacket and that tumbler yours? Can I even enjoy the loots of our labor? Do you think Lukman ever wore that jacket to any of his five TV stations? This kind of expensive jackets are usually name tagged. Check it. We're safe. It has a name on it, but it's Benny Wijanarko, not Lukman. So it's his son's jacket then. And he's very much alive because we didn't get a chance to kill him. How do you think he feels when he sees this jacket? And what's written on that tumbler? - "Monday." - That's a series tumbler, they must have seven of them. "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... Thursday, Friday, Saturday!" They have seven of them. And if the police realize one of them is with you, what do you think would happen? Pull over! Now! Hello, Sarah. Hey, Sarah. New shirt, Frank? Yeah, it was last minute. And I blame your ex. Not an ex when we were not even in a relationship. See, never in a relationship. How did we even have a relationship when he kept disappearing? She's right, Jonny, stop disappearing. You're not ninja Naruto. Be more like Wiro Sableng. Don't waste my time. What do you want? I'd eat anything you serve us. Tell me what you want so I can tell the chef. Fine, what's in your breakfast menu? It's almost noon. Breakfast is no longer served. You're too late. Fine, I want fried rice then. How about you, Jon? They don't serve Pecel Lele and they never will. Do you know why they don't serve Pecel Lele here? I told you we don't have enough catfish suppliers... I don't care. Whatever. - Make it two. - No. Sarah, he has the right to order too. No, because it's not lunch time yet. Fried rice is on lunch menu. - Whatever you have ready then. - Just ask water. You have to order something, or you need to leave. We want to order, but what do you have? We have brunch menu. You don't know what brunch means? It means meal in between breakfast and lunch. Even a little kid knows what brunch means. I know what it means. What I don't know is the menu! Where is it? Look at the table! Do you see that QR code? Scan it with your phone... and you will be directed to a link, tap the link, and in there you'll find the restaurant menu. How am I suppose to know you need a QR code to order in a restaurant. You were not an idion the last time I saw you. Idiocy is contagious, you know? You might caught it from a person near you. That's harsh. She thinks you're an idiot. But I know you love to read. You know oligarchy, masochism, sheeps... Tell her I want pan-fried noodles. Jonny, we speak the same language. It's the unifying Bahasa Indonesia and I'm not your translator. Tell her yourself. If I tell her myself, she's not gonna write it down. Okay then, two pan-fried noodles. And for the drink... Here you go. And you can go upstairs. But we haven't order the drink! I'm thirsty! Sarah! - I thought the fried rice is for breakfast. - It is. - Is it? - Sarah. Can we talk? What's new in our lunch menu? - Hey... - Don't touch me. It's been five years. How long are you gonna be mad at me? Did I hurt you so bad that you still can't forgive me? Did you ever apologize to me at all? Fine... for the hundreds of time, I'm sorry. You think saying sorry will make everything okay? And we'll act like nothing happened... and everything's fine? How convenient. By the way, you're apologizing for which mistake you did? - For every mistakes I did to you. - One apology to summarize everything? - Oh, my God. - That's right. Ask God. Tell God. "God, is it okay if I just make one apology... for every sins I did? I'm sorry for everything." Fine, fine. I'm deeply sorry for what I did to you. For leaving you five years ago. Yes, I admit I was a coward. Yes, I admit I was scared. It was different time. I was in a bad place back then. I just got in the business. You can punish me all you want... I will take it. But please forgive me. What do you want? I just want to gain your trust back, like you used to trust me, that's all. Trust needs to be earned, not given. Can you even understand that? Sarah... Good afternoon, Boss. Mr. Jonny and Mr. Franky. Hello, Mr. Damar. Thank you. Where have you been? It's been few weeks since the last time we can contact you. Our friend here has been looking for insight. That's a good joke. Excuse me while I'm eating my brunch. Yes, sir. They have fried rice. - Your next job will be... - I want to quit, Sir. Come again? Well... We want to... Sorry. I mean, it's me. I want early retirement. You too, Franky? I just can't imagine working alone without Jonny. There were never be me, only us. Johnny and Fran... We no longer on top of the list, apparently. You betcha. They don't have habit of leaving without permission. I tell you what. I'm gonna give you three last jobs. Get them done perfectly today... and I'll give you your pension money. Okay? Okay, Boss. Okay, Jon? Fine. Good. Go... and get them done, and come back here... to retrieve all the payments I owe you. You are dismissed. Thank you, Sir. She's punishing us by not giving us our drinks. Franky and Jonny. "The dynamic duo." "Kings of the unforgiven." "The seeker and the destroyer." Finally slip down to number two. Have you seen who's on top of the list? I think they put the name Manuel. We're focusing more for quality, not quantity. Just admit it, you've lost your touch. You're just like the rest of the millenials... always insecure. Now is not your time. It's mine. Now is my time. Manuel time. Now, listen, bro. One... No, it's okay. He's right. This is our last day. You know this is our last day working here. So, congrats. That's more like it. Be a gentleman. Admit it, you're getting old. It's time for you guys to step off from the game. Well... I hope you've saved enough money for your retirement. That's the oldest prank in the book. And he still fooled you. - I can't believe you let him talk down to us. - What do you want me to do? I want to break his skull before we hang it up. Why bother? You won't get money for that either. You've changed. Frank. Change is the only constant in life. Everybody changed, you too. We've changed from A to B, B to C, C to D, and so on and so forth. The only exception is when we die. Body and soul, dead. Whatever. You just ruined my appetite. And she still hasn't deliver our iced tea! Where are you going? We haven't done eating. Miss. Use this one instead. Who's that? Just a friend. - I know all your friends. - Not all. You mean a girl? Why didn't you just tell me that? - What's so secret about it? - You don't need to know every details of my life. My dear friend Jonny... But you're wrong. I know every details of your life. She's calling you again. Just answer the call. Answer it! Okay, okay, take it easy. - Hello. - Why did you reject my call? I'm busy, babe. Why are you talking like that? You're a man, be more confident. I'm busy. You didn't say "babe". Babe. What, I'm your babe now? I'll call you back later. Why? My brother's sitting next to you? That's about right. That's why I call you. I hate keeping our relationship from him. Let's talk about that later, okay? Are you serious with our relationship? Or course I'm serious. Do you want me to die as prove? I'm tired of keeping our relationship a secret. You can tell him about us whenever you're ready, but I'm telling him today. Please don't. Not today. Take it easy, relax. In time, everything will be all right. Whatever. I'm telling him today when we're showing him the surprise gift. Either you join me or you tell him first, pick one, okay? Bye. But, babe... I have a feeling she's not just a friend. Actually, we're just begin dating. Not bad, and you're already calling each other baby. - Not a problem if you love each other. - Have you slept with her yet? Hey, Boss! Stop it! I'm not that kind of guy. Don't give me bullshit. I know you. Okay, sorry, correction. I'm not the person I was before. I've changed. Because change is the only constant in life. You're full of shit, you know? What's wrong? - That bitch. - Sarah? You just missed the gas pump, Jonny! Jonny! What are you doing? For God's sake, Jonny! It's gonna be so embarrasing when a hitman with countless body count dies in a car accident. What did you put in my food? Nothing that you didn't deserve. My pain hurts more than yours. You want to apologize? You can take it and shove it in your ass. But not like... Sarah? Bye, babe. I know how you like chilli sauce, but you should take it easy with it. I thought I was gonna die. She put laxative in my food. Let's go. Jonny. I need to tell you something. - About what? - In my 30 years of living... Fuck! It still hurts. I mean, it's about the three targets today! Let's smash them. Beat them to death. Easy with the gas pedal. Slow down, Jonny! Oh, God! I thought you've shat everything out, don't speed! After all this years and she still loves you. Love my ass. She tried to kill me. It's called love-hate relationship. But, just be honest. You still love her too, right? What do you want me to say? The old feelings are still there. Sarah is... She's a tough girl. And the crazy thing is... I realized that not long ago. It feels good, right? Falling in love? Only when it's mutual. But there's one thing in particular that made me love her... and respect her even more. Well? Who will run? You? Whose child is that? He's Sarah's child. I thought she told you she lost the baby. She didn't lose the baby. She delivered the baby. And she's been keeping him away from me eversince. So you've spent the whole three weeks stalking your own son here? Actually, it was more than three weeks. I knew about him way longer than that. There are many things you don't know about me. Maybe too many. There are some things you don't know about me either. - What? - Well... Actually, I'm... Fuck! Again? It's like being stabbed. Oh, boy. I swear I think I'm dying. For God's sake, Jonny! Excuse me, but this is an emergency. - Who is it? - It's me. My teacher told me to give you this. What's your name? Farel. Thank you, Farel. I have to go. It's stinky in here. Bye! - I have hairband if you need it. - Thank you. Come here, baby. Let's make a Tok-tok video. One, two, three! Jonny? Sorry. That's my friend. Thank you, sweetheart. Jonny! Jonny... What the hell are you wearing? I shat my pants. Great. I bet they stink like your shit. If it smells like shit, it must be shit. Let's get out of here. Don't put them in the car! Throw it in the trash can! No, I love those pants! His name is Soesilo. He's a professional online gamer. But he always got toxic in games. Are you kidding me? We're gonna kill someone over games? - According to this data, yes. - I think the Boss forgot about my principle. He expect me to kill someone over games? Do you remember when we killed a man because he gave you a bad haircut. It's open. At the back. Clear. We can. You're clear to go. Now! Look out! Where's your dad? Where's Susilo? I'm Susilo. Are you sure you're Susilo? But you're just a kid. You can't be a Susilo. Our target is just a boy. Does he want us to kill a boy? He's almost adult. He just turned 16 yesterday. I don't want to kill a kid. Do you want to retire or not? Hello, guys, hold on, I've got a couple of uninvited guests. I'll kill the second target, you kill this one. Now. No, you kill the kid. Don't be fooled by his cover, Jonny. We almost got killed because of that. He's making other kids out there miserable. Susilo! As punishment... for your crime of insulting the family of a gamer under user ID EmpalBewok6969... Where's your toilet? Where the toilet? Over there, Sir. It's empty. Why didn't you tell me sooner? Jonny. Jonny. I know you. Hurry up. Sit. You have somebody else living here with you? No, Sir. I live here alone. Hello! Hello! Don't you have parents? A father or a mother maybe? Siblings? I have nobody. You have nobody, yet you're filthy rich. My family is still complete, but we're poor. Penniless. I like how you decorate your house. It's clean and tidy. Good. But it's hot in here. You need ventilations. Are you messing with me, you little asshole? It's not me. I think your friend is smoking in the toilet. Jonny! I'm just gonna... Don't do anything stupid. I can shoot you from here. Okay, programmer. You always get us in trouble, Jonny. Are you both hitmen? What do you think? My brother... was killed by a hitman seven years ago. - Really? - Someone shot him in the head... and all over his body in front of a mosque on early morning prayer time. Is it Al Ikhlas Mosque? How do you know that? - Hurry up, Jonny! - I don't know how to flush the toilet! There's no flush handle in this bathroom! - Press the "nagasu" button. - Press the "nagasu" button! Nagasu... nagasu... Which one is that, moron? It's the button with the word nagasu on it! Na-ga-su! Can you even read? It's all in Japanese! I'm not a Japanese! Sorry. It's the third button from the right. Press the third button from the right! It plays J-pop song! Where's the flush button? I swear to God! Which one? It's the third button on the right! Why are you soaking wet? Did you take a shower when I was in the toilet? You had time for that, huh? You had to smoke in the bathroom. Sorry, sorry. I killed his brother. Seven years ago, before I met you. I'm sorry, Susilo. But your brother was a terrorist. No, he wasn't. My brother Rudy Hermanto was a great man. He was not a terrorist. His name sounds familiar. Was he famous? Die, you motherfucker! You killed my brother. He didn't do anything. He was a genius, he loved his country. Take him out, Jonny. You're not dead yet? Come out and let me finish you, motherfucker! Susilo. Listen to me. You're not a murderer. Don't put our unsignificant blood on your hands. I can be a murderer. I can kill you easily without even blinking. You have to pay for my brother's life. And then what? You'd create an endless cycle. Listen, Sus... Do you have a nick name or something? Can I call you Bamba instead? I'm gonna make it simple for you. If you want to avange your brother, go ahead. Kill your brother's murderer. Frank! Shoot him now. You came out from your hiding place because you count my bullets. Okay. - Use my gun. - Jon. Jonny! But killing him... won't bring back your brother. And the police will hunt you down. And for the rest of your life, bounty hunters like us will hunt you down too. Believe me. You're a good kid. You don't want to ruin your life being a killer. Fuck... What do you want me to do? Well... Let's fake your death. And you have to hide, a safe one, far away from here... and far away from people. Hey, moron. Can I borrow a towel? Got towel? You dlink it, you stlong. (You drink it, you'll be strong). Thank you. You dlink it, you stlong. (You drink it, you'll be strong). Are you sure this is original? You can buy any knock off stuff, but in case of medicine, only buy the real stuff. - It smells like your armpit. - But it works. Tell me more about Sarah and your kid. What's his name again? - Farel. - What's your next step? I don't know. It fells weird when you suddenly know you have a child. So you want to quit because you want to play dad with him? Only if she takes me back, that'd be great. It sparks something in me. He gives meaning to my life that was not there before. That's love. I know exactly about that feeling. I don't care what you call it. Mr. Flanky? Baba Tiong's waiting for you inside. Yes, Sir. Wait here while he'a cleansing my aura. - Let's go. - Recharging my energy. Hurry up, we still have targets to kill. It'll be 15 minutes, tops. Or do you want to go in there with me? This way, please. Bow... Your feet... - Don't sleep. - I' just being relaxed. You can relax, but not sleep. Mr. Franky. Breath. Jonny, my man. I'm so refreshed. My energy is fully charged! How about we dance a little, Jonny baby. How's the herb medicine? Good? Yeah, I'm good. I'm beyond good. And it makes me hungry. I think I can eat a man. Better yet, I can eat a friend. Just like catfish eat each other. What's wrong? You want to dance with me? The steps are easy. You hate dancing that much, huh? You have trauma related to dancing? Jonny, don't speed! Our next target is a chairwoman of a foundation. She's on the hit list for money laundring. Excuse me, do you know where Ms. Janice is? She's in the upstairs office. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And she's also a rebel. She took the money and does the opposite. She's a fraud too? She deserves to die then. I love killing a fraud. That's life. And our cover this time are reporters. Yes. - Excuse me. - Come in, come on! What do you mean? That's all. - I'd better go now. - Thank you, and take care. Please sit down. You don't have a single female staff. And you know the ratio between male and female in this country? Hello? Did he just hang up on me? Shit... Excuse me... can you fix an amplifier? Damn. We're planning a protest tomorrow and the amplifier is broken. I'm in a lot of stress right now. Hello. I'm Janice. Who are you and from what company? My name is Karni. And I'm Ilyas. And we're from Suara Indonesia Magazine. So you're reporters? May I know where the protest will be? It's just a routine protest. In front of Department of Labour. Protesting what? The subject that still a problem in our country. What subject? Gender equality, of course. In term of employment. Female workers who earn above minimum wage are only 30% from total employment. He's right. Boom! Water gallon delivery, Ma'am. Come in! Men and women should be treated equally. Women can do everything men can do. - Is it okay if I put the gallon here? - Yes, it's okay. Can you put it on too? I'm just a delivery guy, I don't put on water gallons. Please? Women can do anything men can do... except putting on water gallon on a dispenser. Am I correct, Ma'am? What is the purpose of your visit? We just want to chat with you. Sure. About what? About... Ma'am, it's on. Thank you. Yes. About what? About our client's money you took. Where is it? Oh, that. The thing is... I rejected money offered to me from those companies. But? But then my assistant came in... and told me that we ran out of operating cash... and all the donations that the people promised to us are just that. Promises. So I took the money. But you already knew... that the money is for keeping you from protesting. I knew that. But if you think about it... they should've known better. As a foundation... and we are allowed to take donations from them. So we can assume the money... as their donation to show that they're supporting our cause. She's nuts. What do you want to drink? Wait here, I'm gonna get you drinks. Put It On Yourself Crazy delivery guy. I'm gonna prove it, that I can carry a water gallon. I'm gonna prove it... that a woman can put the water gallon on the dispenser. Oh, my. I can carry the water gallon... and put it on... She's actually not a bad person. She... just have major Karen vibes in her. I'm gonna prove it... that women can also put a water gallon on the dispenser. I think she's an honest person... not a liar. You keep talking about liar this, liar that. What's wrong with you? I don't want to kill that woman. She's a person of principles. She has integrity and she's independent. She's making her own decision. Who are you and what have you done to Jonny? - Gone, Frank. - Gone dead? I think so. Electrocuted. Be careful, the power's still on. I was about to tell her that I can fix her amplifier. You didn't leave any fingerprint in her office, did you? Are you okay? How many times have I told you... not to mess with my sister. I'm not messing with her. What do you call it then? What is your relationship with my sister? I swear to God, I'm not messing with her. Except loving her. Jon... Are you trying to be funny? Come here. - Relax, Jon. - I still remember... when you told me to keep our work from our family. Because we could put their lives in danger. You're not my friend. You're a piece of shit! Relax, Jon. Calm down. Are you willing to sacrifice your own friend? Please. My parents told me to take care of her on their deathbed. She's my only family. And you're messing with my family. - Hello? - I've shared the location. Come here as soon as possible. Okay. Just be honest to me. - I'm not messing with her. - You're lying! Okay, I'm lying. That's not what I wanted to hear from you. - Hey, bro. - Hey, sis. Where's Franky? Listen. I'm sorry... But he's gone. Did you kill Franky? He's not the right man for you. He doesn't deserve you. - You can get a far better... - Let me go! Listen to me. - Listen to me. Listen to me! - You don't have the right... I raised you up... I protected you, so you have to listen to me. For your information... I love Franky. I care about him. You have no right to kill him. Did he tell you about what we do for a living? He told me everything. That's why he helped me built this. Catfish Ranch Jonny Le Bond He used all his savings... to realize your dream. I know you want to quit. He's in the trunk. Babe, wake up. Franky! Babe... Are you okay? No, are you okay? Why do you smell like shit? It's your brother's pants. I passed out smelling his pants, not because he hit me. Where is he? You built this? Yes, brother. Can I call you brother? No. If you break her heart... I'll kill you for real. I love her. Jon... Brother... Are those rashes on your neck? I don't know. But they're itchy and at the same time burning. Maybe hairy caterpillars fell on you? Could be. Let's check it at the hospital. - I don't need to go to the hospital. I'm fine. - Don't scratch it. Let's go to Medika Hospital, it's the nearest from here. - But it's too expensive. - Wait. Or to Cempaka Hospital. - But it's too far, babe. - It's not. Now, get in the car. So you're having an allergic reaction. But I've never had allergic reaction to anything before. We tested your blood sample... and the result showed that it was triggered by allergen found in sea urchins. I didn't step on it and I've never been to the beach. It's not by contact... but by consumption. That's even more impossible because I don't like eating sea food. You dlink it, you stlong. (You drink it, you'll be strong). Fuck... - Franky! - Yeah? Come here. I'm here. - Come here. - Well, doc? The diarrhea potion you gave me from what's his name again? Baba Kiong or Keong? - It's Baba Tiong. - Whatever. What's in it? I don't know. Some herbs and stuff? - Does it contain bulu babi? (Babi: pig). - That's impossible, pork is haram. I can tell by the look on his face, the potion is halal. Bulu babi we're talking about is some kind of shellfish, not a mammal. It's often used in traditional medication. - You tried to kill me. - That's impossible, brother, I just... Fuck you! Don't call me brother. Now, excuse us. You can pick up the prescription at the pharmacy. - Thank you. - Get well soon, Sir. Yes, doc. Don't scratch that part. That nurse is still here. I'm going to the pharmacy and pick up your presctiption. - Can you watch him for me, babe? - Okay, babe. Are you testing me? - Fine. Bye. - Alright then. Bye. - Take care. - Okay. Brother Jon... Sorry, I mean, Jonny. Do you know why I picked this hospital? Why? Our third target is in this hospital. - What do you mean? - Our next target's name is Bruno Pahlevi. He's gonna do some physical exams in this hospital. And if he's deemed healthy, he's gonna be transferred to the next building... to be executed in the execution room. His criminal record is full of brutal crimes... such as thefts, robberies... extortions, murders and rapes. Can you stop scratching when I'm talking? But it's itchy. Just take it like a champ. Continue reading. One more thing, we need to extract something from him to bring back to Boss Damar. We only have 10 minutes window of time between his general check up... and the time he's gonna be escorted to the execution room. We want take the plate. What took you so long? We don't have much time left. I'll be executed in 10 minutes. Sorry. But we like working last minute. Hey... Where's my boss' stuff? Take that thing to Damar. And now you can kill me. As punishment for all your crimes... of raping women, the killings and scamming people... You deserve to die. Shoot him, Jonny. But how about the police ouside? They're just low rank officers. We can take them all out. That's not what I meant. I mean, why creating chaos? Because we are the agents of chaos. I smell something fishy. Who ordered this hit job? Do you have the name? I... ordered it myself to Damar. Who are you... and why are you so hell-bent to be killed by us and not by execution? It's about making a statement. It's not meant for you... and you're not expected to understand. I'm making a statement about controlling your own life. And resisting from being controlled by anybody else. Believe it or not... you're already in the system. We are the agents of chaos. He's a perfect match for you. Then I'm gonna destroy the system. We're no gonna kill him. We're gonna make a statement. - What statement? - That this time... your system fails. Whatever. Kill me now. - What the fuck! Frank... - Kill me now! Die! Frank... Don't move! Don't move! Pull him. - Let's go. - Is it done? It is. Or is it not? I don't know, I'm so confused. Everything's done. Let's go. Why do you keep throwing my clothes on the ground? Bruno Pahlevi's execution went smoothly after a little incident before the execution time. It's all over now! We can live peacefully from now on. Such as murders, thefts, robberies, rapes and drugs. What? I just want to make sure the backseat is screwed properly. Keep going. Keep going. It's not straight but it's okay. We own this place. Wait here, I'll be right back. Okay. I took two steps away from you, and I'm already missing you. It's called love. Des... Where's Sarah? She went home. Already? Yeah, she took the morning shift. I'm gonna go make a phone call. Hurry back. Hello, there. Are you Mercy? Jonny's sister? Yeah? - The boss wants to meet you. - Can I wait for Jonny to come back first? He wants to speak to you alone. Okay. A new era is about to come, Mr. Franky. Are you ready for it? Actually, we're not. That'w why we want to retire. How did you do? Did you kill all three targets? All three targets are dead, Boss. That's not my question. I asked you if you killed those people. Technically... it was the Grim Reaper who took their lives. Franky. How long have you been working for me? Seven or eight years? That's quite long. I think so. But why does it have to end like this, Mr. Franky? With you betraying me. Franky is lying to me. I don't understand, Boss. What lie are you talking about? Actually... I don't usually forgive such a massive betrayal. I should've slaughtered your body. But? But because I like you... I'm giving you a chance to live. By making me do what? Killing Jonny. Well... It has to be that way. One of you should die. Or the three of you die. - Hey, asshole... - Come to the location I've sent you... or I kill your sister. Understand? Hello? Fuck... Jon, it's Manuel. This is what I've been dreaded to think. You dragged my sister in our world. If anything happened to her, I will never forgive you. Not just Mercy. He also put price on Sarah and Farel heads. They don't care about Sarah or Mercy. They just want me dead. There's only one way to end all this. We die... or we kill them first. Let's go to Sarah's place first. I know Manuel's game. Sarah's apartment is on the third floor. Block G. Our ex friends are coming, Jonny. And I think the big guy is watching us. Back off, or I'll make a hole in his brain. Fuck! Show yourself. Franky! - Who is it? - Jonny. Don't go out, stay inside. Are you okay? Come here, baby. Hey, Farel. Hello, Uncle. Are you here to use our toilet? - What is he talking about? - Nothing. I come here to play hide and seek with you. But you have to wear these first. Get in here, kid. Come here, baby. You have to find a safe place to hide. I promise, I will end this tonight. Jonny. Please be careful. - Hello? - If you want your sister alive... kill your buddy Franky. And bring Franky's body to the second location I gave to you. I'm gonna watch your movement, or... your sister dies. Cheers. So this is it? I love you, Jon. But I love Mercy more. Do you think Mercy is gonna forgive you for killing me? I have to fight till the end. We have to find happiness, we don't wait for it to come. If I die now... I won't find happiness. Okay. Do whatever you have to. That's not the answer I want to hear. Well, I guess the show's over. Now it's time for the main event of the evening. But I lost all my proteges. You still have me. You don't need those scumbags. It's all bullshit, anyway. Easy. Just relax. Is that Jonny? You really did kill him. Come on. Franky! Franky. Die, you son of a bitch! Jonny! If you want to quit... this is your only way out. Yes, Boss. If you want to quit... this is the only way out. Are you okay, baby? Hey, wait for me! - Are you all right? - I'm the one who should ask you that. I'm sorry. Jonny! Jonny. Wake up! Jonny. - Somebody, help! - Please, wake up. If you're messing with my sister... I'm gonna put a bullet in your brain. Jonny! Jonny, wake up! Please don't go! Wake up! Please don't leave me. You can punish me all you want, I will take it. But please forgive me. I just want to gain your trust back, like you used to trust me, that's all. I thought he spent all his money for fun. But apparently... He had been paying Farel's tuition. And the rent. We're gonna plan a murder that suits him well. Thank you and we'll keep you posted. Here. It's your next target. Where's my gun?
