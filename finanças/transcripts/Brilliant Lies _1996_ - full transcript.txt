(light music) (bright music) - [Marion] Can you give me examples? - Of the harassment? Sure. (tense music) (paper crumples) It went on from the moment I arrived. But if you want the highlight. It was the night I was asked to stay back, just before I was fired. He's watching me. I can feel his eyes all over me. He gets up, he throws a piece of paper into the bin. Like he's some hotshot basketballer. - And then what happened? - [Susy] We're the only two left in the building. He comes up behind me and says this is boring. - This is boring. - Let's talk sex. Gary's not subtle. - What did you say? - I said you been talking sex to me Gary for the last seven months. I don't find it titillating and I don't find it amusing so please stop. And then he says do you want to keep your job here? I said yes. (dramatic music) (unzipping) There's no prizes for guessing what happened next. - Unfortunately I do need to know what happened next with as much precise detail as you can remember. - I was sitting at my computer and he came up behind me. I concentrated as hard as I could on the screen. And then suddenly I felt two hands on my breasts and he said something sick making like the twin peaks of womanhood. Soft, sweet, seductive. Stop it! I froze and when I turned around-- (unzipping) His penis was inches in front of my nose. (breathing heavily) I went to Vince, Vince owns the business and I told him what had happened. He called Gary in, he asked him if it was true, Gary denied everything. Then Vince sent me out, I could hear them arguing. Then Vince called me back in and fired me. I think Vince knows what a sleaze Gary is, it's just he depends so heavily on him he had no choice. - Now before this incident, Gary talked sex over the interoffice phone. - My desk was just outside his office so sometimes the phone would ring and I would think it was an outside call. (phone ringing) Life Choice Options, can I help you? I'd pick it up and it was him and some vile fantasy or another. - Fantasy? - Which position he was screwing me in, how he was doing it. I was usually so shocked he got two or three seconds in before I could hang up on him. And these fantasies just got progressively worse. - Well why didn't you go to, uh, Vince earlier? - I just thought Gary was pathetic and I should be able to cope with it myself. - You didn't talk about it to any of the other women there? - There were only three and they weren't exactly friendly. - Why not? - I don't know, maybe they (sighs) resented the fact that I wear decent clothes, that I had a decent education? - Decent? - I don't know. I went to a private school. I mean it makes absolutely no difference to me. But it did to them. - Did you go on to university? - I went for a term. Couldn't stand it so I went to Europe. I lived in France and Italy for two years. Then Dad went broke and that was the end of that. - So you came back here and got this job. - Oh, I couldn't get a job for about three years. Is it okay if I smoke? - We'd prefer you didn't I'm afraid. So who supported you for those three years after you got back from Europe? - Men. I fooled myself I was having a series of deep and meaningfuls. The truth is I was passed from hand to hand around the half dozen or so wealthy unmarried heterosexual men left in the city. Three years on I found myself back where I started. So I did a word processing course. Finally after dozens of interviews I got a job. - Not the sort of job you were hoping to get. - A firm of shonky insurance brokers called Life Choice Options was definitely not where I wanted to position myself in life. - Now your letter said that you were an assistant manager. - I assisted the manager. - Tell me a bit more about Gary. - He did accountancy, management at some minor college. He drives a cheap Porsche, he married above himself. He obviously doesn't get enough sex. He has about as much style and panache as a gorilla but he thinks he's Mel Gibson with a dash of Rupert Murdoch. (laughs) So where do I stand? - Well in terms of the legislation you do have grounds to lodge a case of harassment and wrongful dismissal. - So we go to court? - No, it's a public hearing. But if you take that option, the difficulty is going to be to prove your case. - So it's basically my word against theirs. - Yes. - I did tell my sister Kate about this. Right from the start. We rent a place together. - She'd be prepared to back you up? - Well she saw how upset it was making me. I read somewhere that some woman got 40,000 the other day. - Well that was very severe harassment. She had proof. - The reason we dismissed her was because we found her work unsatisfactory. - Susy claims she was sexually harassed. - Well she wasn't. - Did she tell you this story about Gary exposing himself? - She said Gary had fondled her breasts and invited her to perform fellatio yes and this was the culmination of seven months of severe phone harassment. - It's absolute rubbish, it's absolute nonsense. - Look, the truth is that she would come to work with... Everything for show. - Boobs popping right out of her dress. (laughing) - Dresses up to here. Blatant! - What made you hire such a person? - Well that was Gary's decision. - I thought she had potential. - Potential? - Work potential. - Right. - But she spent so much time on the phone organizing her social life no one else could get through. - Some mornings she'd arrive looking like she'd come straight from an all night drug party. She actually admitted to one of the women in the office that she took drugs. - Ecstasy, she went to an ecstasy party. - And had sex. Now she told this to a married woman who was shocked! - Yes, as a married woman sex and ecstasy do seem a startling combination. - She fell asleep at her desk. - You kept her on for seven months? - Well we kept hoping she'd, uh... She had potential. - Course, potential. Playing the devil's advocate here, just for a minute, see I'm finding it very hard to understand how a girl whose only activity while she was employed by you was either to sleep at her desk or phone her friends lasted for seven months. - Well, maybe we're painting her a little blacker than she was. She did brighten the place up. And she could knock out a decent letter if she had to. - So how did you address this problem with her? - Well, finally I realized that something had to be said. (laughing) (suspenseful music) You know, give her some sort of warning. So that night I got up and went out to her, trying to work out, you know, the best way to tackle it. I mean she always thought that she was too good for us. - [Marion] Too good for you? - She always wanted to work in something more trendy than insurance. - So how did you tackle it? - I decided to start by giving her a compliment. You know, positive reinforcement. That's coming on quite nicely. - I phoned the girl who Susy replaced. Uh, let me see, Rhonda Gibbs. Gary, Rhonda told me you made frequent sexual innuendos in front of her and that was one of the reasons that she left the job. - I told her a couple of jokes. I mean I thought that women wanted to be treated equally. You can't even pay a woman a compliment anymore or you're being politically incorrect. - Is this compulsory, this conference? - If you choose to you can refuse conciliation and the case will go straight to a legally binding public hearing, but I would have thought there were reasons you wouldn't want it to go that far. - This is the punchline, huh? Pay up or get your name in the papers. - Press tend to find this sort of case newsworthy. - Great choice. Damned if you do, damned if you don't. Who needs proof anymore? The truth doesn't matter when lies'll get you the same result. - With only two people present there really is no such thing as verifiable truth, but it is my job to try and make this process as fair as possible for both sides. Do you want to try conciliation? - What other choice have we got? (soft jazzy music) - Dad is very upset. Dad is very upset. Very upset. Very upset. Dad is very upset. (scoffs) - About what? - [Paul] About you losing your job. I mean heaven only knows what he'll think when he finds out about Susy. - I've got a job! - Oh yeah, qualified architect driving a taxi, great. - Oh well. Dad hasn't been a shining success himself lately. - [Paul] What are your plans, Susy? - I'm taking them to court and they're going to have to pay a lot of money. - Unfair dismissal, I reckon you'll get a couple thousand at the most. - Unfair dismissal plus sexual harassment, Paul. - Sexual harassment? - What's so strange about that? - Well for someone as... - Someone as what? - Well, you're not exactly chaste! - Oh Paul. - Well so what happened exactly? - Exactly? Well my boss would make at least one phone call a day suggesting things like I come into his office, take off my clothes, and suck his dick. - Well these things only happen if they're encouraged. - Hey! - [Paul] Well the clothes you wear, the short dresses. I mean what kind of signals does that send? - What women are only-- - You think women should dress like Muslims, Paul, covered from head to toe? - No one ever rings up Rachel at her work and suggests things like that and maybe it's because she doesn't wear dresses with her breasts almost popping out! - Rachel hasn't got any breasts. - Nice ass though. - Nice ass. - Look, there was a purpose for my visit today but if all you're gonna do is hurl insults at me and the woman I intend to marry-- (laughing) Oh yeah well I know our heterosexual marriage wouldn't exactly appeal to you Katy so-- - Oh Jesus Paul! - I guess I'd better go. - Oh look, come on, I'm sorry. It's just sometimes you're so intense. - Well, Dad is very upset and yeah, so am I, especially now that Susy's lost her job. - [Susy] Paul, I'm fine. I'm gonna get 40,000 bucks. - [Paul] 40,000? - Yeah. - Harassment's just one step down from rape, Paul. Some women are so badly traumatized by it they need psychiatric help just to get them functioning again. - So what are you gonna do with your $40,000? - Start up a business. - [Paul] What kind of business? - A cafe. Italian style, great food, all Italian waiters. - You can't even add up a column of figures! - Kate is gonna be my partner Paul and she's gonna design it. - Yeah, so tell Dad he needn't worry, not that he'd ever care. - Why do you always say he doesn't care? - Face it Paul, he's a drunk. - You weren't so down on him when he was sending you to top private schools or expensive holidays or off to Europe for two years with your own gold American Express card. I didn't hear much criticism of him in those days. Look, I'm not trying to be heavy and Christian about this but Dad is a terribly sad guy right now and when I spoke to him the other night I felt really bad and I remembered all the good things he'd done for us. Some guys I went to school with never even saw their dad. Who picked you two up after dances and watched you play net ball? Oh we all know his faults, sure, but there's a lot of love there too, you know? It's his 63rd birthday coming up next week. Do you know what'd really thrill him? - A blowsy tart and a bottle of Johnny Walker. Alright, I'm sorry. Yes, he was affectionate. Yes, he did things for us. And he made us put up with a succession of his hideous girlfriends, most of whom were invariably drunker than he was! - The first of which arrived on our doorstep two weeks after Mum died, Paul. - [Katy] Oh they were there before that, he just didn't bring them home til then. - How do you know that? - I heard them arguing about it once. Mum was crying and do you know what he said when he realized he couldn't squirm out of it? He said it didn't mean anything and it was just that he had a lot of love to give. - God he could be pathetic. - It wasn't just the women that upset Mum. It was his lies, big lies, little lies. Got to the point where I don't think she'd believe anything he ever said. - Okay, we all know his faults. - Yes. What do you want us to do? - Do you know what'd thrill him? If you guys invited him here to dinner for his birthday on Friday week. He told me he never even seen where you lived. Now you've never invited him and he's too... Too proud to ask. - Alright, fine. Will Rachel come? - Oh no she can't make it that night. - Oh of course we can't ask Rachel to break bread with a lesbian. - Her committee meets Friday nights. - Lawyers for Christ. Do they get a quorum? - The Christian Lawyers Fellowship, thanks very much. They have 180 members. - Thanking God for converting. (laughing) - I saw him smile. - Well just because you believe in God doesn't mean you can't have a sense of humor. (laughing) - I gotta go. I gotta get dressed. - Party, eh? - I'm meeting friends. I'll see you Friday. - Katy. I just want to say that well just because I have certain reservations about your lifestyle, it doesn't mean I don't care about you or Susy. - I know. And we care about you and Dad. - I mean I know it's not very sexy in your eyes being involved in floor coverings but I'm already the second largest wholesaler of sea grass matting in the state. - Well done, mate. - Oh thank you. And I know you don't mean it, but thank you. Does Susy really think she's gonna rip 40,000 off her employer? - I believe her story, Paul. I believe she was unfairly dismissed and she was harassed. - $40,000 worth? (sirens wailing) - Vince and Gary both seem to feel your work performance wasn't good. - That's rubbish. - You were efficient? - I was as efficient as I needed to be. Okay all I had to do was answer the phone, type out a few letters, and enter stuff on the spreadsheet. - You didn't spend a lot of time making personal calls, falling asleep at your desk, boasting about drug parties to married women? - Drugs, what drugs? - Ecstasy. - I knew I shouldn't have told that mousy little suck. I took ecstasy once, okay? It did nothing for me and it is none of their business. - Vince did admit you did brighten the place up and you could write a good letter. - I was fired because I would not go down on Gary, end of story. They humiliated me and I want compensation. - I've scheduled a conference with them for Thursday at three. Is that okay? - That's fine by me. - Can your sister come too? - Do we need her? - She's the only one who can corroborate your story. - I'll ask her. - Good. (light music) - No one'll believe her. - Oh, there's a large percentage of the population will be delighted to believe her. According to the bloody feminists we're all rapists. Some of us just haven't gotten around to doing it yet. - Come on Gary, no woman I know believes in all that feminist crap. - Read the papers, mate. - But you didn't do it. - Who said that life was fair? - It's outrageous. - It's the '90s. You don't need evidence anymore, you just have to be able to lie. We're white wealthy males. Forget about the fact that my parents were dirt poor. That I went to a lousy school. That I worked as a barman and studied til two o'clock in the morning to get my diploma. Forget all that. I'm a white middle class male so I had it easy. So I'm fair game. If this goes to court, Vince, the press'll be onto it immediately. - Stephanie'll be devastated. - My wife is never devastated, that's far too passive. It's always somewhere between cold fury and blind rage. We've gotta settle. - Stephanie'll be upset but I don't think she'll believe the allegations. - Oh yes she would. I've never given Stephanie any cause to doubt me from the start of our marriage and she still thinks that I'm capable of having sex with just about any kind of animal you care to name. - Gary, I think you'll find that Stephanie trusts you a lot more than you think. - Vince. Can we talk straight? You keep telling me that nobody's gonna believe it, but it took me half an hour to convince you! - You haven't always treated the girls we employ very well, Gary. - What exactly are we talking about? Rhonda? - Yeah, I overheard a few things. - A few compliments. Look if Rhonda's so flaky she wants to leave because of a few compliments, that's her problem. - Yeah well let's not go into all this again. - Whatever the settlement is I expect the firm to cover me. - Well how much will they want? - A lot. - Five grand? - They're gonna laugh at that, Vince. You owe me. I've kept this business from going under. - I've been around here too, Gary. - I can't pay what they're gonna want. - Well let's find out how much they do want. - It's gonna be more than 5,000, I can tell you that. - Jerry said he saw you having lunch with a couple of merchant bankers on Tuesday. - Couple of college friends, Vince. - Hmm, I thought so. - I expect the firm to cover me, Vince. - Well when you've been married to a woman for 12 years you just don't sit down at the breakfast table and say, "Pass the sugar, I want a divorce." This isn't like you, Fran. You were always such a good sport, such fun to be with. - A funny thing happened to me at the office party today. I ran into your secretary, Miss Olsen. Let me see, there was Miss Olsen and then there was Miss Rossi, no, no she came before. Miss Koch came after Miss Olsen. - No Fran-- - And just think. Right now some lucky girl in the building is gonna come after me. - Well I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you. Besides it's kind of awkward for me shopping so here's $100, you go and buy yourself something. They have some nice aligator bags at Bergdorf's - Shh! - You could have at least done the dishes. What is this new routine? No work so you sleep in til midday? - What are you doing home so early? - I had a job in the area so I thought I'd just come by, have a coffee, you know, maybe hear a few words of appreciation like gee Katy, you look so tired, thanks for working 12 hours a day to keep us both alive. - Gee Katy, you look tired. Thank you for working-- - Why do you wear my pajamas? And have the audacity to look so much better in them than I do? - Because I'm a sex goddess. If I'd been born in America I'd be Madonna by now. - We could do with the money. It's already Friday, I've made less than 150 bucks. So how'd your meeting go? - Good. She thinks I've got a great case for the compensation. - I should think so. - She wants you to come to the conference. - Why do I have to be there? - Because you saw how much trauma Gary was causing me. - No I didn't. - Because you're my only corroborating witness. - Shit Susy, you want me to lie? - I was distressed, Kate. - Why didn't you tell me? You know, if it was going on for seven months why didn't you tell me? - 'Cause I just thought he was stupid. I was ashamed that I couldn't handle it. - Right, so tell me what I'm supposed to remember. - How I'd come home in tears, go to my room crying. That sort of thing. - Well why didn't I ring him up and blast him, eh? Lesbian feminists are supposed to do those things, not to mention older sisters. - Yeah yeah, well they don't know you're a feminist lesbian and I would appreciate it if you'd do everything in your power to conceal that fact. - Alright so you want me to lie at all levels. - Well certainly at that one. - Well I hope you're going to do your share of the cooking for our father's birthday dinner. - When is it? - Try tonight. - Did you buy him a present? - Yes. - Is it expensive enough that it could have been from both of us? - It's a tie. - It is Sarah's party tonight you know. - No way Susy, you're staying home and entertaining your father and you are helping me cook. Now go and buy a fucking present. - Can you lend me some money? (scoffs) - Mate, you're gonna have to get 40,000 bucks just to pay back what you owe. And I want change. Oh, and better get another cask of red. I've got some Wolfblas bottles we can decant it into. Dad's tastebuds gave out year ago. - Wolfblas gray label, it gets better and better and better, the man's a genius. He's done more for the Australian wine industry than any other man, bloody genius. - I think it's very disappointing. I've tasted better wine than this in casks. - Paul you're such a bloody knoll. - Well if you don't want me to have an opinion I won't. - It's a bloody good wine, your sister spent a lot of money! Why are you so hypercritical? - I'm entitled to my opinion. - Well your opinion's usually worth shit so shut up. (laughing) - Oh fine. - No no no, you're a good kid, I love you just as much as your sisters but sometimes you're bloody irritating. - Fine. - I want to say something to all of you. (clears throat) This dinner tonight means more to me than you could possibly, possibly imagine. Do you know I once had the lot? More money than I knew what to do with. Loving wife. Wonderful kids. Then fate intervened. Took your mother in the cruelest possible way. We watched her fade away, and die in appalling pain. If I'd been a stronger, better person I would have gained strength from this loss but instead I sank into a morass of self pity. Self-indulgence. I slept with women who weren't a tenth the person your mother was, you know? I drank. And I did what no salesman should ever do. I started to believe my own bullshit. I started to believe that I could predict the trends on the property market a year before they happened. (urinating) The crash came a year before I thought it would. Now I'm bankrupt. Barred from practicing my trade. Living in a empty flat. I've only got meself to blame. You guys are all I've got left. Sometimes I think I've even lost you. - You haven't. - If I did Paul I'd shoot myself. I would, I'd shoot myself. 'Cause you guys are all I've got left, you see, all, all. I know you're mad at me. You got every right to be. I mean I should have had millions to leave you. Millions. 23 million on paper at one stage. - 23 million? - Now I'm a penniless drunk, I know you're mad at me for that. - 23 million? - 23 million. Bloody amazing isn't it, when you think about it? Kid who had to wear shoes with holes in 'em because his parents couldn't afford any more. 23 million. - You blew 23 million? - 23 million, yep. - Dad, you're a fucking idiot. - [Paul] Susy, language! - Well he is, he's an idiot! - I know you're mad at me, you've got every right to be. - Dad, I've gotta go out. Girlfriend of mine is having an engagement party. - Susy. - Shut up Katy. - Let her go, let her. - Happy birthday. He's a fucking idiot. - Don't be such a bitch! - Well that is absolutely typical. - [Katy] Oh Paul, shut up. - I can understand it. It's not the money. It just would have protected her from indignities like having to work for that slime who propositioned her. She's better than that. - Why is she better than that? We all have to work for a living. The only profession that pays money for a pretty face is prostitution. - Paul Paul Paul Paul Paul some people have a quality of magic about them. You can't say why but she's got it. She'll do something that'll surprise us all one day. - Magic? - Katy, Katy. Your magic is your creativity. Those designs you did? Breathtaking. - Mm, so breathtaking I was the first laid off when my firm made cuts. - Yes, well maybe there were other reasons. - Of course there were other reasons, Dad. It's an almost totally all male firm and they found out I was a dyke? - Katy, I've got to say this. I'll be failing as a father if I didn't. I do happen to think you have taken a wrong turn. Do you see Katy men are men. And women are women. For a purpose. - Oh god. - No, no hear me out Katy, hear me out. I do think there is a profound magic in that indefinable and mysterious difference between man and woman. A mystery that kept me tantalized and intrigued by your mother til her dying day. (laughs) - Dad, sometimes you talk such shit I can't stand it anymore! You were out screwing drunken sluts for years while Mum was still alive, it drove her crazy. - That to me is one of the deepest mysteries. I mean, how could a man who loved a woman as I loved your mother do that? It's a question I keep asking meself every day of me life. - Yeah well you know the question I'm still asking myself Dad, birthday and all-- - Katy, don't. - Is what kind of temporary insanity caused our mother to marry you? - [Paul] Katy! - Did you have charisma once? After the wedding did a horse kick you in the head? If she had to go and get herself married, why to you? - You're right, you're right! There were much better men than I was chasing her, why me? Again you see it's one of those profound mysteries in the dance of the sexes. The dance, Katy, I'm really really sad you are going to miss. - If the dance of the sexes mean I might end up with a partner like you mate I'm glad I sat it out. - Shall I just accept the fact that she sleeps with women, say nothing? - If you ask me all this gayness is nothing more than a fashionable pose, an easy way out. - Absolutely. Male and female drifting alien continents. A relationship with the opposite sex is difficult, yes, but ultimately far more rewarding. Thank god Susy stayed straight, eh? - Straight? Promiscuous would be more accurate. - She'll surprise us all one day. - If she manages to rip 40,000 off her employer I'll be surprised. I think it's outrageous! - Well you don't know what happened, Paul. - I've had to work my guts out for every dollar I've ever earned. She finally gets a few months' work and tries to rip the system off. I mean aren't you a little bit outraged? - Don't be so judgmental! - I'm judgmental and I'm a knoll, anything else you'd like to call me? - You're a good kid, you're making something of your life. We've all got faults. - Can't fathom you, Dad. - What have I done? - I had to organize tonight, you know, I mean I had to drag them kicking and screaming to get them to invite you over. You're big enough to admit that you blew it financially and then Susy walks out. You're honest enough to tell Katy you don't approve of her gayness and she storms out yet I'm judgmental and I'm a knoll. - Fathers and daughters, it's always a bit of a thing there. - So you admit it, they do come first. - Ah Jesus Paul! - Don't use that word. - What? - Jesus. - Jesus! You know what the most disappointing thing in my life is? That you became a bloody Christian and you met up with that, that what's her name. - Rachel? - Rachel. You're so smug and self-satisfied. - We do so choose to believe. - We do so choose to believe. Ah son there is no God. - How can you say that? - Because if there was he'd be bright enough not to recruit the two of you. (thunder rumbling) (rain falling) How can anyone believe that this appalling, bruisy, humiliating scape of interpersonal warfare we laughingly call life is assigned by some all-loving father shit? - Well I have to believe in something. I mean perhaps God just like the force that created the Big Bang but I mean there has to be some order or some purpose, otherwise what's the bloody point? - I'm sorry son, I'm sorry. It's me who's being the judgmental old bastard. If it helps you to believe, believe. Don't listen to worn out old sods like me who've got one foot in the grave. - Have you been to see the doctor yet? - I'm fine! - Well no you're not! If you're getting chest pains every time you exert yourself the chances are you've got heart trouble. - Ah well if I die, I die, what the hell? - You want me to come in? - Why? I'm fine! - Well you got Monday, alright? - Yes yes yes yes okay. - Well, goodnight Dad. - Goodnight son. - Can I just say at the outset that we are-- - Uh, no, please could you sit down? - Both very upset at being dragged in here like criminals. Gary and I are men of substantial standing in the business world-- - Substantial standing? - [Vince] What? - What are you trying to say, that two important men like you find it beneath your dignity to be called to account for a minor little thing like seven months of vicious sexual persecution? - Vicious sexual persecution? - We don't think it's right, but unsubstantiated allegations-- - Hey. They're not unsubstantiated. I'm substantiating them. - Listen sweetheart, without sexual attraction the human race wouldn't have survived. The death of sex means the death of mankind for christsake! - I'm not saying you shouldn't have impulses, I'm saying you should be mature enough to control them and don't call me sweetheart. - I took a totally normal interest in an attractive woman and suddenly I'm a criminal! - After thousands of years of abuse males are finally being held accountable and you don't like it! Well let me tell you something buster. The days of automatic female deference to male power are over and you just better get used to it. - So I'm supposed to be the fall guy for what you call thousands of years of abuse, am I? Great. And to think we used to say that women were irrational. And don't call me buster. - This was to be an attempt at conciliating the problem but if you prefer you're at liberty to take this to a public hearing. - Look, I'm sorry Marion, I really am. - So am I. We would like this settled and we would like to settle it here. - Alright. Let's start again. Susy, you claim that Gary made phone calls of a sexual nature over seven months which you found distressing? - Extremely distressing. (clears throat) - [Marion] Given his behavior, why did you agree to work back with him on the night of the alleged incident? (tense music) - Well we had to get the new spreadsheet working and he'd said he was sorry. I didn't believe him but I knew if he tried anything I could at least do a, but Gary, you promised. - Why didn't you go to Vince before this if it was so upsetting? - Well I like to think that I can handle my own problems myself. - [Marion] But you did tell your sister. - [Susy] Which I normally don't. Which is some indication of how upset I was. (crying) - [Marion] And Susy indicated to you how upsetting these phone calls were? - [Katy] Um yeah, which is unusual for Susy. We're close in some ways but she does tend to keep her problems and worries to herself. - Can I ask a question? - Yes, of course. - Thank you very much. Katy it's obvious that you're a feminist. - Do you always spit when you say that word? - Well would a strong feminist whose sister came home crying with tales of brutal sexual exploitation just say okay, put up with it, it'll stop sooner or later? - Kate wanted to go down there and rip the place apart. I had to beg her to stop, didn't I? I mean I wanted to last a year at this job just to show I could stick it out. - Katy? - Yeah, I was very angry. But with the job market the way it is I could see Susy's point. - Well according to my notes, Susy claims that Gary grabbed her breasts from behind and said the twin peaks of womanhood, soft, sweet, seductive. Then you turned to see Gary's penis. (scoffing) - [Gary] Oh Susy that's bullshit, you know it is. - That's exactly what happened. - It is utter, utter bullshit. - Alright, what did happen? - Just what I told you. - Well, let me see. You decided to give Susy a warning. You were considering the best way to broach it. - Right. (laughing) And then I went out to talk to her. - [Marion] And then how would you describe your demeanor? - Well I was concerned. It's always tough when you've got to discipline an employee. - Right. So concerned you're shooting three pointers into your wastepaper basket. - What do you mean? - Susy said you threw a piece of paper over your shoulder like a basketballer. - I was reading a letter! (laughing) I got up, I threw it in the bin. What are we arguing about here? - [Marion] Alright, so you went up to speak to her and what did you say? (tense music) - I didn't get a chance to say anything. - How come? - 'Cause she jumps up and says stuff this, it's boring, I've got a party to get to. And I said to her that occasionally she had to be prepared to work back. - Oh Gary, it's after seven o'clock, I've been working on this all afternoon. - You know if you hadn't been on the phone for the last half an hour chatting-- - That was a business call! - [Gary] And it developed into a shouting match. - Don't touch me! - And she ran out the door. I mean she obviously realized she was finished at Life Options so she went away and hatched this bullshit story to screw money out of us. - And she's not going to get away with it. - You are lying Gary and you know you are. - How did she describe the incident to you? How did she describe the incident to you, Katy? - Oh, exactly like she told you. - What, he grabbed her breasts and said the twin peaks of woman-- - Yes, all that. - She's lying too. - I'm not. - [Marion] Please, accusation and counter accusation is not going to get us very far. - Where is there to get? It's her word against mine, and she's lying. - No I'm not. - Let's stop all this crap and start being realistic. I'm in a no-win situation. If this goes to court I lose out even if we win. There'll be jokes behind my back for the rest of my life, my wife and kids will suffer. If I want to preserve my reputation, I have to pay money. - No one wants you to pay money if the charges are untrue. - Well how in the hell are we gonna prove it one way or the other? It was just the two of us there and she can say whatever she likes! This all comes down to who the jury likes the most and we all know that the man is always the villain. The system stinks! Let's be totally realistic here, Marion. The system is stacked against me. Now I'm incredibly angry about that, but I'm also a realist. If we can pay her her blood money and settle this right here and now, then I'm rational enough to realize that it's in my best interest to do it that way. How much cash are we talking about? - $40,000. - That's insane! - It's a high figure but these complaints have been settled for amount-- - Marion, why is that a high figure? I mean some football hero got $350,000 'cause a magazine photographed his dick. - $40,000 is insane. - It's on the high side but there are precedents. - It's what I want or we go to court. - This is coming out of my pocket, Susy. The firm can't pay, it's in debt. It's coming out of my pocket! - [Susy] So it should! You're the one who did it. - Would it mean anything to you that I've got two small children, a mortgage you couldn't jump over, and cash reserves of exactly $2,000 in the bank? - That's not my problem. - Well there's no way that you are getting this out of me. - Fine, let's go to court, see what the judge thinks. - You've just blown it, honey. - Don't call me honey. - I was prepared to play ball but not to the tune of $40,000. - Suit yourself. - You can rob me, but not 40. And listen honey. Don't think just because you got the bloody sisterhood on your side that you can take Gary Fitzgerald to the cleaners! I've been threatened by experts and I tell you what. No feminist mafia is gonna put it over me! - Gary, I can't tolerate this. - $40,000 or we go to court. - This is outrageous, surely you can see that this is outrageous. - Vince, you know what he's like. - 10 and that's it! - 40. - We can make this a lot tougher for you in court than you think. Drugs, parties, you will not come out looking good, believe me. - No, these kind of threats are really counterproductive. - Counterproductive? They're disgusting! I mean what the hell has her partygoing got to do with anything? And you, you think that because she's had sex with more than one man she's available to anyone, even someone she despises? - I think the best thing we can do at this stage is call a halt now and let us all go away and think about this. - Great. - Fine, you can think about it all you like but I'm not shifting one dollar. You poisoned every day of my life for seven months and if it hurts you financially, tough! You deserve it. - You think I'm just some nothing that you can squash? Well you're gonna find out that you are very, very wrong! - This is very, very counterproductive. Can we just stop now, stop totally, say nothing? Just file out the door separately and don't say anything more please. I'll schedule another conference for next Tuesday. If I need further clarification before then I'll contact you. Please Susy. (cork pops) - We've got 'em. - Yeah. - I mean we may have to come down a little from 40, but basically they know they're stuffed. I mean Gary knows he's trapped. Kate, if we make a go of this cafe thing, we're never gonna have to put up with shit like that ever again. What's wrong? - Those words you used. Where'd you get them from? - What words? - The twin peaks of womanhood, soft, sweet, seductive. - Gary, it's what he said. - No he didn't. - What are you calling me a liar? (tense music) - Gary didn't say that. Dad did. - You told me Dad never touched you. - He did. - You told me I was lying. - Yeah I know, I'm sorry about that. - How old were you? - I don't really want to talk about it. - How old were you? - 13. Same as you. - What did he do? - Um...same thing? Started as a game in the backyard... He'd end up grabbing my breasts. And I would just freeze. - Why didn't you scream? - Because I was scared Mum would hear. And I would have killed myself rather than let her find out. - [Susy] Did he do anything else? - No. No the grabbing was the worst. - How many times did he do it? - I lost count. - And Paul beats us around the head for not wanting him over for dinner? Why did you tell me I was lying? - I don't know. I think part of me was relieved it wasn't happening to me anymore. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Guess it was worse for you than me. - So is the rest of the stuff about Gary a lie too? - I made up the bit about the twin peaks, Kate. But grabbing my breasts and the rest of it? Absolutely true. (pensive music) - Why do you think that she's lying? - Well I can't say I particularly like Gary but it seems to me that your sister's decided on a sum of money and manufactured her story to match it. Now I may be wrong but I felt very strongly I should voice my concerns to you before tomorrow so thank you for coming in. - Yeah well sort of puts me in an impossible situation. - You get pretty good at interpreting body language in this job. You looked very uncomfortable when you had to back up her story. - Can we consider what I'm about to say to you totally confidential? - I really don't think I can give you that sort of guarantee. It's up to you. - I was lying. Susy didn't tell me anything. But that doesn't necessarily mean she's lying about the harassment. She never tells me about things that are worrying her, she's not the confiding type. - Do you think she's lying? - I think she might be exaggerating her story a bit, but no, I don't think she would make up something like this. - Does she realize if she pushes Gary too hard he's just as likely to take this to the tribunal? - What about the publicity? - Well he'd like to avoid the publicity but if the alternative is $40,000. - You think? - Yeah. Their lawyer'd make sure that the board would hear that she parties, that she takes drugs, she sleeps at work. I mean, I wouldn't like her chances. She could end up with nothing. - I'll talk to her. - I think you should. And thanks for being so truthful, Katy. Doesn't happen enough these days. - Well I think you're doing a fabulous job and I'd hate to think that Susy was... Yeah. Anyway, I think you're doing a fabulous job. - Thank you! - $5 closest to the pin. - Yeah alright. - Double or nothing hole. - Yeah alright. - So Vince, how much is the firm willing to back me? I need to know. - Well. Considering the financial position of the firm. - [Gary] How much? - If it does go to the tribunal you'll probably get a tiny paragraph in the afternoon paper. - It'll be on 60 bloody Minutes, Vince. It'll be disaster for me. Stephanie and her bloody family-- - Gary, I think you take far too much notice of what Stephanie and her family think. - There's another agenda here, Vince. - What? - You're refusing to pay because you do believe her. - I'm refusing to pay because the firm is broke. - You do believe her. - I don't! - You do or you wouldn't be prepared to see me crucified in court! - Gary, the public will be on your side. The promiscuous drug taking party girl, she'll be crucified, you'll win! - You believe her, and you're prepared to throw me to the wolves. - The firm will cover you for 10,000, I think that's fair. - Let me tell you something Vince, I don't! You are throwing me to the wolves! - There has to be some truth in what she says. - Oh now it comes out. - Well there has to be, considering the way you've treated other women-- - A few jokes, a few compliments. - Well I know you've had affairs with at least two of our girls. - They were willing, they wanted it. Christ you're a fucking fossil, Vince. They should carbon date you. Most women love sex. - Yeah? So why do they all leave? 10,000 I think that is more than fair. - Yeah well I don't. I'm really pissed off. - It's too much. - It's what we need. - You'll blow it Susy, it'll backfire. - Come on Kate, don't do this. It's for both of us. - I told her I lied. - You what? - She spotted it, she knew I was lying. - You didn't have to tell her! Why the fuck would you do a thing like that? - She asked me, I had to, I'm sorry. I told her I thought you were telling the truth. - [Susy] Great. - I couldn't lie to her. - The minute I saw that dyke I knew you'd fall in love with her. - Marion? - Yeah Marion. - She's not gay. - Get new glasses, Kate. She was eyeing you all through that conference. - Really? (gentle music) - You're such a loser Kate, you can't even spot your own species. Now she's gonna think I'm a total liar. - I told her I thought you were telling the truth. - Yeah well I was telling the truth. Gary was vile to me for seven months and I hated every minute of it. And he is gonna pay $40,000. - Well Marion says he won't pay, he'll go to court. - Yeah well I know Gary better than Marion does, and he will do anything to hide this from his wife and her family. He's terrified of them. - Susy, for god's sake, you've got to be reasonable. - What? And live the rest of our lives like this? No way. - [Marion] The twin peaks of womanhood, soft-- - [Susy] You can't even spot your own species. You're such a loser, Kate. (overlapping voices) - I'll be very interested to hear what conclusions you've all come to since the last meeting. - Well, we have-- - Katy, would you sit? - Gary and I have considered your submission and we're quite prepared to settle for $10,000. - [Susy] You're joking. - It's our last and final offer. - 10,000, you're joking. - It's more than we ever intended to pay and quite frankly we're outraged at having to pay that. - [Susy] You want this to go to court. - [Vince] If it has to. - Could you schedule the hearing as soon as possible please? - Okay, 10 of my own, that's a total of 20. - [Vince] Gary. - I haven't got 10, I'm gonna have to borrow it so it's an absolute final offer. And I can't tell you how angry I am at having to do this. To say that I think that this is criminal is a gross understatement. 20,000, final offer. - Could you schedule the hearing as soon as possible please? - Oh I can't believe this! - Susy, you can't be serious. $20,000, 10 of it straight from Gary's own pocket. - Susy, 20,000 is an offer that I really think is worth considering seriously. - Well I'm sorry, I don't think it's enough. - It's a very generous offer, isn't it? - It's within the range of what I would consider fair. - Marion, as I understand this the negotiation is between Gary and I. - I'm just offering an opinion. - Yeah well in my opinion 20,000 is not nearly enough so let's go and see what the tribunal thinks. - I would have thought there were things that you'd want to keep out of the media too. - Like what? - Like your lifestyle. (scoffs) - I once took ecstasy, big deal. - How much will you take? - Gary, don't let her do this. - How much will you take? - I'll take $40,000. - There is no way. Can you understand that there is no way that I could raise $40,000 even if I wanted to? - What are your net assets, Gary? Way above 40,000 I suspect. - You want me to sell my house? - If necessary. People go to prison for what you did! You're getting off lightly. - She's crazy, she's insane. - [Susy] Vince, you know what he's like. - For god's sake Susy, be reasonable! - When were you ever reasonable to me? - I never did anything to you and you know it. How can you sit there and lie? - [Susy] I'm not lying, you are. - You bitch. (dramatic music) You vicious, lying, filthy little slut! - [Marion] The conference is over! - You're getting out of it for less than 40 now. - We'll take the 20. - No we won't! - Her sister knows it's bullshit! She knows, you bitch! - Gary! - Susy, this conference is over! - Alright, I'll take $30,000 but that's it, that's absolutely it. - Give the bitch the money Vince. - Gary, no! - Give her the 30 so I don't have to see her ugly face again! - The conciliation is terminated. - This is between me and him! - Not here! - Alright you put in 15, I put in 15. (shouting) - Wait a minute, wait, no wait! Thanks. Thanks a million, Marion. Why the hell didn't you let him settle? - There can't be a balanced settlement under conditions like that. - He wanted to pay, didn't you hear him? He wanted to pay, why would you pull the plug? - Because quite frankly I don't think we've got to the truth of it yet. - What are you saying, I'm lying? - We fought long and hard for this sort of power. I hate to see it being abused this way. There are an awful lot of women who really suffer, who need this place. - Well you listen to me Marion. That guy was on the phone to me every single day for seven months, saying things more degrading and hostile than you're ever likely to hear in your protected little life! - Oh shut up, Susy. - You have been lying about the office incident though, haven't you? (elevator dings) - Whose side are you on? Both of you. - She realize how dangerous this is getting? - Well I think she thinks she's gonna win. Do you wanna go and get a coffee? - Oh, have to be quick. My husband's picking me up early. - Oh. - It's our wedding anniversary. - Oh, congratulations. Oh don't worry about it. Excuse me. I just have to go and kill someone. - I saw a video of his angiogram. Now I'm not a doctor which you didn't have to be to see what was going on. - What's an angiogram? - It's an x-ray of the heart pumping. You see all the blood going through the coronary arteries. Now Dad's coronary arteries are almost totally blocked. - So what's the prognosis? - He either gets a triple bypass soon or he's dead. - So, he gets a triple bypass. - Sure, in 12 to 18 months, that's the waiting list. - Waiting list? He's privately insured, isn't he? - No. - No? - How could he be? He's living on the pension. - So what are his chances of living the 12 months? - His doctor said 50/50 but my feeling is that he was being optimistic. - And how much does this operation cost? - 30,000. - 30,000. - It's open heart surgery. - 30,000. - I thought you were about to get 40,000. - Oh no no no Paul, that's for me. You're the one with all the money, you're the one who's made something of your life, remember? - I'd help him if I could but I can't. - What do you mean you can't? Are you doing well or aren't you? - I possibly will be, but not yet. - Well according to you Paul you've been carpeting half the city for the last 10 years. - Maybe in two or three years' time I'll be in the clear but it's a highly competitive area. - You could raise 30,000 if you had to Paul. - Susy I'm 120,000 in debt. - In debt? - What about your girlfriend? She's a highly paid lawyer. - She's already pumped 25,000 into the business. She's kept me afloat. I know what you think of Rachel but if it wasn't for her I'd be sleeping on a park bench. - So how's he taking it? - He's cracking hard but underneath he's worried sick. - He's 63 for christ sake. If I drink half as much as that man and live to be 63 I will think myself very, very lucky. - So you'll just let him die? - He won't die Paul. You are such a drama queen, you always have been. - Okay, let him die. (laughing) - I'm sick of this shit, I've gotta be somewhere. - That's right, whenever something difficult or hard to face happens it's off to another party. You are so gutless and shallow. - And you are such a geek, Paul. - Yeah, a geek too. One day you're gonna have to start judging things beyond the surface. - Jesus you're boring, Paul. - And would you stop using that word? Sometimes I could kill her. - I've tried, she recovers. So you're really that much in debt, are you? - Top of my year in business school but out in the real world I'm a joke. - You're talking to a taxi driver. - Oh I don't know, to survive in the '90s you either gotta be lucky, rich, or be a brilliant liar. I'd pay that money for Dad if I had it, I really would. - Yeah, I would too. Dunno why. (soft jazzy music) - That bitch humiliated me. She made me panic. - I think we have to call her bluff. - You don't have to do anything, Vince. I have to call her bluff. - Good. - I've been behaving like a coward on all fronts. - I think your reaction was quite understandable. - No, it was gutless. I've done what I should have done weeks ago. I've talked to Stephanie and her family. They're right behind me. And I talked to Steve Lovett on the 19th hole yesterday. - Lovett? Good. - With him representing me at the tribunal, she won't know what hit her. She's gonna get nothing from me. - I'm really glad. - Nobody humiliates me like that and gets away with it. It's been a real turning point for me, Vince. Public will see it for what it is. A blatant attempt to extort money by a scheming, amoral little bitch. - I hope you understand why I couldn't go higher than 10. - Yeah, I understand alright. You believed every word she said. (tense music) - That's not true. - It was a real shock. But it's freed me. If that's what you think of me, fuck you Vince. Fuck you. - Now just a minute. You understand our financial position better than anyone. I just couldn't afford to extend the firm any more. - Yeah I understand this. You believe her! Fuck you! - I've got good reason to believe her. Good reason. - Oh yeah? What? - One night when I left the office, I got down to my car and I thought I'd left something behind. So I came back up. When I was looking for my key I heard something. - [Gary] What did you hear? - [Vince] And I could see you on the intercom and you were talking to Susy. And she was pleading with you to stop. - [Gary] Stop what? - [Vince] Stop calling her? I could make out what she was saying. - [Gary] You couldn't have heard. - I know how you treat women around here, Gary. You've done a good job. I'd be the first to admit that. But-- - You want me to get out? Leave? Is that the message? - Yes Gary actually it is. I think when all this is settled it might be best if you moved on. - Yeah well, I've got a little bit of news for you Vince. As of today I've got two merchant banks backing a buyout of this joint. One condition. I run it. - Those merchant bankers you were having lunch with? I thought they were supposed to be college friends. - I lied. Don't get pissed, Vince. This place is ripe for a takeover. These are hard times. We've got to be much much much more aggressive. And you know and I know and they know that you don't have the guts to go in hard. Now you can refuse to sell, but if you do that I'll leave and you'll go bankrupt. - You know something Gary? I'll be glad to go. I've been ashamed of the way this place is run ever since you came. - Well fuck you mate. I'm the reason you survived. - When I started this firm it really did give worthwhile advice to its clients. - Yeah well I'm gonna give you more money for this shitheap than anybody else will. So if you get subpoenaed by the tribunal, be very very careful what you say. - Don't worry Gary. Vengeance isn't my cup of tea. - If we withdraw the complaint we get nothing, absolutely nothing. Gary drives off in his Porsche and we're stuck between shifts in your taxi. Great, but your conscience is clear. - Look, he's going to court, Gary is going to court. I can't lie in court. - Come on Kate, you can lie when you want to. What's worse, helping me get some kind of justice out of a sleaze like Gary, or lying that Dad never touched you-- - Oh that's not fair. - When you know very well that I needed you. - Come on. - Come on Kate, be straight for once in your life. Deep down there's a little bit of you that wants me to miss out on this, on everything. There always has been. - That's not true, Susy. It might have been when we were younger, okay, but it's not now. I'm sorry, I just can't lie. - You really fucked up, Kate. We had a way out and you really fucked up. (bagpipe music) - We're born, we prosper, we wither, and we die. It's called the human condition. - We're gonna raise the money, Dad. - No you're not, the government's gonna pay for this operation, not you. - What, in 12 to 18 months? - Well I'll last that long. God, I'm not that sick. - I've spoken to your doctor, I've seen your angiograms. - Paul, Paul, Paul I appreciate what you say but I know the reality, I know how much debt you're in. And I know the girls haven't got any cash to spare. - Dad, I was supposed to get some money from my employer but as it turns out-- - Yes yes, Katy told me. Shouldn't even feel obligated. It's not as if I've been a great father. Well don't all disagree. - You've been terrific. - Thank you girls. - Paul said it for all of us. - Thank you for letting Paul speak on behalf of the great depth of warmth you both feel for me. It's the first time you've let him speak for you in his life. - Dad, you behaved like a shit. Most of the time you behaved like a shit. I'm sorry you're sick, but I'm not gonna suddenly lie that I think you're wonderful and all that crap. - I behave like a shit? How many times did I have to cover for you, young lady? I had to go and beg your headmistress not to expel you. Not once, not twice, but three times! When I got the medical verdict I did have one quick moment thinking ah, Susy's getting 40,000. Maybe all isn't lost. But I immediately came to my senses and knew there was no way Susy would give it to me. Even if it did mean 10 years of life. - She would have given it to you Dad. - No I bloody well wouldn't have. - Why? - He knows. - Susy shut up! - If you'd offered I wouldn't have taken it. You've got a right to a decent start in life. I recognize that. But I would like to think you might have offered. - The man's ill. - Well he carries on with this act of hurt and wounded dignity. - I am hurt. Deeply hurt to think that you wouldn't even have offered. I've spent three times that amount on you in your life young lady. - Out of guilt. - Guilt, guilt for what? - You know. - For being drunk so often, having all those appalling women. - Appalling? Which ones were appalling? - All of them. - What about Gwen Mountjoy, she was like a mother to you. - Gwen Mountjoy couldn't find her way to the kitchen after five o'clock. - None of them were as good as your mother. - Look Dad, we'll raise the money okay. We'll go around to all those acquaintances of yours and screw something out of them. But just don't bullshit about being ready to die if you're not. - No one's ever quite ready to die. - And stop putting on this wounded act 'cause we don't sit around here fake adoring you. There are good reasons for it and you know what they are. - Susy, just give it a rest will you? - Someone should say. - Say what? - The truth. - What truth? - You know. - What truth? - Dad, just leave it. Susy, please. - No no no no. Susy seems to have something to say. Come on Susy, come on. What is it you want to tell us? - That you're a sleaze. - Don't. - He is. - What are you saying, Susy? - I'm saying that you shouldn't be particularly surprised that we aren't as enthusiastic as we should be. - Why, because I made a few innocent comments about the fact that you were growing into young women? - What the hell are you on about Susy? - Is that what you're referring to? - Dad, forget it. - No I won't forget it. So your breasts grow. So I notice it and comment. Is this a hideous crime? - Let's not get too melodramatic, eh? - Is this a hideous crime? - No, now can we forget it? - Oh that's right Kate, just sweep it under the carpet like you did last time. - All fathers notice their daughters' development. All fathers notice. I was proud. All fathers notice. - All fathers don't chase their daughters around and grab their breasts! - Susy, I didn't! - Calm down, it happened, okay, it shouldn't have happened but I'm sure it hasn't totally ruined our lives. - Yeah well I just want him to understand why we're not willing to cut off our right arms for him. - I didn't touch them Paul, I swear. - Dad, don't lie. You only stopped when I screamed at you. Now I know alcohol may have destroyed most of your brain but you have to remember that. (laughing) (screaming) - Dad! - I deserve to die. - Don't start that, Dad. - You do have some redeeming features. - Like what? - Well. When Mum got sick you were her gentleman, kind. - I'm sorry okay? I'm sorry I laid all that on you, you've got enough problems. I don't know what's wrong with me sometimes. - No more talk of raising though. If I die, I die. I mean it. - Please don't be penitent, Dad. Your remorse is more nauseating than your crimes. - I don't know, as a Christian, I don't know what I-- - Oh shut up Paul, please. Don't be so bloody pious. He groped me, I whacked him, end of story. - Unforgivable. - Dad will you shut up? Will you just shut up? - Susy. - What? I don't know what to do, okay? I'm not talking about that other stuff, I'm talking about the illness and the money. I don't know what to do. - Do what you usually do, just run. - Just do nothing. - She can't just do nothing Dad, don't be ridiculous. - Well I'm on my own here Kate. I've got a crucial court case. And you won't even testify. What the fuck am I supposed to do? - Hey, for once in your life try telling the truth. If you still know what that is. (low murmuring) - Starting to think you weren't going to show up. - I had to turn in the cab. What do you mean? Of course I'd be here. - I just thought you might have decided I didn't quite measure up to your exceptionally high moral standards. - Susy, look I'm not gonna lie for you but you know I'm on your side. Who got you your lawyer? - Yeah great. Gary gets a $1,000 suit and I get the bargain basement. - You couldn't afford a phone conversation with that guy, okay, now who else were you going to go to? Rachel and her Lawyers for Christ? - I thought you couldn't be involved in the hearing. - I'm not. But I can be in audience. - Great. So you've come to see me lose as well. - Of course not. Why would you say that? - Oh come on Marion. - [Marion] Oh, I see he's got Lovett acting for him. - [Katy] Is he any good? - [Marion] Only the best. - Silence, all stand. Please come to order. This public hearing by the anti-discrimination tribunal presided over by its president, Mrs. C. Bortolotto and Mr. C. Buxton and Mr. B. Hall, members of the tribunal. In the matter of Susan Connor, complainant versus Gareth Fitzgerald and Fitzgerald and Associates is now in session. Please all be seated. - [Ruth] My name is Miller and I seek leave to appear for the complainant. - [Steve] My name is Lovett and I seek similar leave to appear for the respondant. - Thank you Mr. Lovett. Ms. Miller. - Thank you Ms. President. The complainant in this matter, Susan Connor, claims damages against the respondent pursuant to section 17 subsection one, 21 subsection 2B, and for acts that also constitute sexual harassment and wrongful dismissal in breach of sections 21A2 and sections 120B1 and two. At all material times in this matter the complainant was employed by the second respondent that is Life Choice Options proprietary limited-- - Life Choice Options doesn't exist anymore. It's my company, Fitzgerald and Associates, your honor. - Fitzgerald and Associates is the same company, Ms. President, the name however has been changed in support of which I offer up the certificate of incorporation on change of name to the company and the complainant also claims damages to the respondents pursuant to section 17 subsection one. - Yes Mr. Lovett. - If the tribunal pleases there are some preliminary matters which I wish to raise. May be appropriate to hear them now before my learned friend proceeds on her full opening. - [President] Yes, alright. - [Steve] If I may clarify with the tribunal-- - Here we go. - Some dates of critical events in this matter. As I understand it... And in breach of 21A2, alternatively 20B1 and two, the various provisions of the act have been breached. And sexual harassment is alleged to have occurred... Grounds J and new text Australia and president and members of the anti-discrimination tribunal, page 807. If I may offer a copy up of this judgment for the tribunal? - Ms. President. - Yes Ms. Miller? - While I concede that the tribunal could come to the conclusion that paragraph four, subsection B of the Xeroxed form in which the respondent allegedly requested to suck the complainant's tits be disallowed as part of the original complaint, it would nonetheless be my submission that is it inferential from the additional document and the paragraph mentioned that there is a necessary nexus. - See I told you she was good. - It all sounds like bullshit to me. What would they know? I was the one who was there. What the hell is a necessary nexus? - It's a ritual they have to go through especially when they're being paid a fortune. Now your lawyer's doing alright, just be patient. It is gonna be a very long day. - Marion. You wouldn't have another cigarette, would you? I'm sorry-- - Oh yes, sure, sure. - Thank you. Oh god it's a nightmare in there. Don't they ever get bored with technicalities? I thought Mrs. Whatshername would never call a break. - How do you think it's going? - Believe me, they've hardly started. Key thing of course will be Susy's evidence. - Oh great. When we got up to leave Lovett looked at me and smiled, the bastard. - Now you don't need to be intimidated by him, Susy. Just tell the tribunal exactly what happened. Time's come to tell the truth. - [Registrar] Take the bible in your right hand and read the oath from the card inside. (clears throat) - I swear by almighty God that the evidence I shall give in this case shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. - Be seated. - Will the witnesses be removed, Madam President? - Registrar? - Would all witnesses kindly leave the room? - Is your full name Susan Alison Connor? - Yes. - [Ruth] And until July 1st of this year you were employed by Life Choice Options, is that correct? - Yes. - As assistant manager? - I assisted the manager. - [Ruth] Mr. Fitzgerald. - Yes, that's correct. - I began to put to the tribunal a series of events which led to your eventual dismissal from Life Choice Options. Now Fitzgerald and Associates. Do you recall these events? - Yes I do. - Well, perhaps if I take you to each of the things you complained of, hmm? I mentioned the question of Mr. Fitzgerald's prior infidelity, and it's-- - Madam President. My learned friend I anticipate is about to lead the witness in relation to critical events-- - [President] I hope she's not going to do that. Ms. Miller? - Thank you Ms. President. No, that is not my intention. Susy, could you tell us the chain of events which led to your dismissal? The real story, Susy. In your own words. - The real story. The real story is that I did lead him on at the start. Believe it or not I even found him quite attractive. He asked me out for lunch. I said yes. Pretty soon it became physical. - Bullshit! - Lunchtime sex. I'd walk around the corner, he'd pick me up in his car, and within about five minutes we'd be at my place. - That's bullshit your honor! - We'd be well gone before my sister got home at three o'clock. It was pretty wild for a while there. - [Ruth] Go on Susy. - One morning I woke up. I thought where is my life going? Why am I sleeping with a man I don't even like? Who makes a living lying to clients who trust him? And who makes love like it's some kind of violent punishment? - I never went near you, you bitch! - Mr. Fitzgerald, could we please hear Ms. Connor's version? You'll get your say shortly. - It's all lies! - [President] Continue please, Ms. Connor. - When I told him it was over, he didn't take that at all well. You see Gary's sense of himself requires that he discards women. They don't discard him. And that's when the phone calls started. I'm not exactly a delicate flower. But some of the things he said on the phone really shook me. I should have left, I know that now. But I thought no, stuff it, why should I leave? Okay fine I started it, but I felt I had a right to end it without getting abused. - You're insane! - You know they'll bar you. I'm sorry Stephanie. - What, I'm supposed to sit here and listen to this bullshit lie? - Yes. You'll be better equipped to defend yourself when you know what she's said. - This isn't easy for me, Gary. You've got a problem so why don't we address it? - Please address your comments to the bench, Ms. Connor. - I'm sorry. - Go on, Susy. - I know men get angry when they're rejected. That's normal. But what he started to do was not normal. He didn't just want to punish me. He seemed to want to completely annihilate me. (intensifying music) I knew I was dealing with someone who had an immense hostility for women. He could barely control it. I knew I couldn't last much longer at this job unless I organized some kind of cease fire. I thought that night that we worked back, with just the two of us there, you know, I thought I could maybe talk him through it. It was the worst night of my life. Gary stop it. He grabbed me. (muffled shouting) He started going on about how women were two-faced bitches who demanded equality and then turned around and used the same old pussy power they'd been using since Cleopatra's time. (clattering) (groaning) - All you little bitches are the same. Think you can treat men like shit. (suspenseful music) - He said his wife treated him like shit and now I was treating him like shit. That I was gonna get down on the floor, crawl across the carpet, and give him oral sex. (crying) He started ranting on at me. - About what? - About his wife. About when he had an affair how she woke up his daughters and told them about their father the adulterer. He told me that his wife got more pleasure out of her vibrator than him. And how he hated her so much that the only thing that made him feel good was that he cheated on her four times since. Well I thought, I thought this guy's crazy. I gotta get outta here. - Where are you going? It's locked. - I'll scream. - He said to me scream away. - Scream away. No one will hear you. - No one's gonna hear you. - You wanna keep your job here? (crying) - [Susy] And then he asked me again. - Do you want to keep your job here? - I said yes. - Good. Then get down on the floor on your hands and knees, crawl across here, and suck my dick. (intense music) Do it! - So I got down on the floor. And I crawled towards him. (gagging) Suddenly I found myself choking on a $50 note. - Thank you Ms. Connor. That certainly clarifies matters. Perhaps it would be a convenient time for a break. The witness has been in the box for a while. - [Ruth] Yes, thank you Ms. President. - I'm sorry I lied in some of my earlier statements. I just felt stupid and ashamed that I'd fallen for that macho stuff in the first place. - I'm afraid too many women do at the start. No further questions, Ms. President. - Mr. Lovett? - No questions. Madam President, under the circumstances I request an adjournment in order that I might confer with my client on an appropriate course. - [President] Yes Mr. Lovett, I think under the circumstances and assuming Ms. Miller has no objections, we will call an adjournment until 2 p.m. - [Registrar] All rise. (suspenseful music) - Taking from one sleaze to help another. If only it had been Bob Geldof or someone. - Susy I've been wanting to ask you something. Since the hearing. - Mm hmm, what? - Was that all true, what you said? - Kate, you think I lie all the time? - So it was true, all of it? - Come on Kate. A locked door, a guy like that, what do you think happened? - Right. So the $50... - Should have made it $100. - And when they opened me up they said they knew immediately I wouldn't have lasted the distance. So the fact that I'm here today owes everything to you, Susy. - So, now that we've paid the money what are we gonna get? How do you intend to spend the next 10 years of your life? - You'd like value for money? - Actually yeah, I would. - Well I've found a very old friend and proposed. - Proposed what? - Marriage? - Marriage. I want a real, loving, full relationship. - Who's the lucky girl, Dad? - Gwen Mountjoy. - Gwen Mountjoy? - Mm hmm. - 30,000 to see Gwen Mountjoy stumble down the aisle? - She's cut back on her drinking. - What, like you have? - Well not today, this is special. - Well you'll certainly get a full relationship with Gwen. - Susy, I appreciate what you've done for me and I'll try and live the last years of my life decently. What more can I say? - Well you can start by saying thanks to Kate. She's the one who made me hand over the money. - I'm sure she didn't. - Oh yes she did. Don't kid yourself. If it'd been up to me, we would have been down at Alcoholics Anonymous today scattering your ashes. - After what you did to them Dad you're lucky that Katy and Susy were prepared to chuck in anything at all. - Okay I'm sorry, sorry! Father who's drunk a bit too much gives his daughters a playful little tweak? Big deal! - More than a tweak. - A tweak, Jesus! - Please don't use that word! - If that's all it takes to ruin your lives than pity help you. - You've got no idea, have you? - What? - To you it was just a funny little game you played. Why are we making such a fuss, right? - Well I didn't mean... What... Couple of little tweaks! - Dad will you stop trying to minimize it? Okay I know you never listen to anything I ever say and I know I'm the family joke. But I do know that what you did was not decent, not normal, and not bloody acceptable. No I mean it Dad, it's the most disgusting thing I ever heard. Bloody disgusting. Yeah poor old Paul, what a loser, big joke. And I always thought it was because I wasn't good enough or something. Yeah well now I know why I never got any gold American Express cards. - Is there anything I did right with you bloody kids? - You groped them and you totally ignored me! - Well what do you suggest should happen to me, eh? Hanging? Castration? Would your old mate God settle for eternal damnation? Your brother thinks I'm a monster. - Yeah well he's not the only one, Dad. - What? - For years I had fantasies that the best thing I could do for Mum would be to kill you. I still dream about it sometimes. - Dad. We trusted you, okay? You were like God to us. You were charming, funny, loving. We trusted you with our lives and then one day we turn 13 and we're nothing but tits on legs. Do you have any idea how that feels? Do you have any idea? - We don't want to hate you, Dad. We used to love you so much and we really miss that. - I'm sorry. Susy. Katy. I'm extremely grateful for what you did for me. Thank you. Thank you. And Paul, Paul. Thank you too. You're all great kids. In spite of me. So here's to my family. Hmm? - Susy. Forgive and forget? - Forgive maybe. Forget no way. - Paul? - Come on Paul. - To the family then. And to harmony between the sexes. - Dad, don't get carried away. (light music) - Yeah, let's just drink to a truce.
