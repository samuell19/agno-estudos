Welcome to Memmingen. Weinmarkt please. Weinmarkt? Alright, let's go! Good morning Memmingen. This is Hitradio RT1. You're listening to Bettina and the Weather Max. Good morning! It's Friday, actually a very special Friday; it's the day before Fischertag. So, tonight Memmingen will party as if there won't be a tomorrow. Fischertag is a very special event for a lot of you guys, we know that. And it's our biggest local festival in Memmingen. Memmingers have been jumping in the brook, for almost 450 years. Big mistake, Max. But you're not from Memmingen, so you're excused. But this is crucial; we don't say jump in the brook, but 'jucken'. I see. And it's only men who 'jucken' in the brook, women have never been allowed! Okay, so the men 'jucken' in the town brook and try to catch the heaviest trout. The one with the heaviest trout becomes the Fishermen's king of Memmingen. I've thought you came here for Fischertag, not for tax return. ...and it dates back to a very old custom when the craftsmen boys of every guild jumped in the brook to clean it. That's where our Fischertag comes from. So tomorrow it's that time again, and I think everyone is already super excited! Tomorrow's Fishertag will once again be a real gathering of the crowds! Ten thousand people are expected tomorrow, when at exactly 08:00 our fishermen 'jucken' in the brook at the gun salute! And of course we'll keep you updated about the next fishermen's king, here at Hitradio... What are you thinking? Nothing. It's all fine! What time do the lads arrive? Karl's should arrive this morning. The others, no idea... they come from everywhere to Memmingen. Oh man, not only do I have to bear Fischertag, but also all of your childhood friends will come here. What? Well get off then! You know I don't like that. Hey, don't you leave me like this! Hey dude! Good morning! How was your flight? Was okay. What was that? Surprise! Morning! Hey, Jonas! Hi Auntie! Good morning, mum! Come on, let's get you in your wheelchair. You're lookin' great today, mum! You're in a really good mood today, Jonas! Well, tomorrow is Fischertag! But Jonas, you haven't ever really been interested in Fischertag... I've always thought you'd only jump in to please your dad. Well, the older I get, the more I get into our local festival. Besides, I 'jucke' in! Dear me! What's the matter with you!? I'm just looking forward to tomorrow, meeting old friends! In the end, they all come back to Memmingen that day. Right, tomorrow, they'll all come back home again. Don't think about it, auntie! Don't allow the bad memories to get you down again! Oh Jonas. You have no idea what it feels like. I'm here to look after your mother every day... every single day... But you don't have to look at her. She's probably better off than we are. But it's not fair! Of course, it's not fair. I lost my mum and my dad that day, and you lost your beloved sister. But do you really think she would have wanted us to be so down all the time? But we have to look after her! Yes, but not every day. We have to start living our own lives again. That's what she would have wanted us to, for sure. Oh Jonas, what has become of you? I still see the little boy when I was at your place with the police back then. And now you've grown up so fast... actually, you haven't really had a proper childhood. Oh Auntie, this is long time ago. I've grown up now and I can look after myself. Life hasn't always been kind to us, but it has also made us what we are today. And by the way, we have some work to do tomorrow. What do you mean? You helping hand, me fishermen's king. Or do you wanna jump in? Jonas, what would I do without you? I think I now need you more than you need me. I've thought you came here for Fischertag, not for tax return. Of course we're here for Fischertag, but it has turned out that we settle this once a year, and Matthias is our man in charge. Matthias is actually good with numbers. And good for screwing. Fortunately, I cannot judge this... Wow, I don't know him like this at all! But since he knows that you are coming home for Fischertag, he's been completely crazy! Hey, that's how we know him! No, for real, usually he is rather quiet, a typical accountant. I don't know him so outgoing. I mean, I like it... I think... See, it's good for something that we all flock in here. Yes, definitely! You know, he doesn't have many friends here ...that's why... I'm really happy you are here and that I meet you. Ahh... the lads! - Hey guys! - Alex! My brother! Eh... What's so funny? You've all brought your documents! Yes! Fischertag, Judgment day. That's how it is, and I'll take care of it. Let me introduce you to the boys... this is Paul, my little brother, our youngest family member. Without hairs he looks really dangerous. But actually, he's a kind one. Actually! Sven sits in front of the computer all day long that's why he is so pale... Alex, our Russian! Born in Siberia, raised in Memmingen and he is one of us. Look, the accountant got a nice bed frame! I speak Russian! Wait a second... What? Perfect Rusic swear word! Ha ha! I told you this would happen eventually! Now everybody, listen up, you people! And look what we are showing today! We call it our local festival! I salute you fishermen and guests! So this day provides a lot of benefits, and not only cleaning the brook. Fischertag brings much profit to our homeland, custom and public spirit! Come on now! Raise your nets and let them hear our thanks. I'll come to the end. Everyone jump in at the gun salute! Go away, go away! Out of the way! Put the gun down! Drop your gun! Whats happening? Apparently someone was shot while fishing. Wicked! Pegida or so... wanna protect the fish?! You mean PETA... I don't think so. Of course! How bad? According to our emergency doc just a bullet wound in the shoulder... awake, responsive. Here they come. The patient has got the following injuries... Yeah, yeah - alright. Thanks Mrs. Shit! Soaking wet! Hey Bernhard! It's just a little water, don't be so soft. Sorry, but you cannot park here. You must move your car! I know exactly where I'm going to park... Move the car! What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen a woman in the brook? Really, gun use, in the brook? Yes, a young man was shot! With a Glock 17, but we probably won't find the cartridge case anymore... What do we know about the shooter? About 20 years old, he's already at the station. But he hasn't said anything yet. What about the victim? Late thirties, shot through the shoulder, no danger to life. So far so good! Good morning, Sir! Good morning, it can only get better. You've already been at the crime scene, I have some more information: The shooter is 20 years old, born and resident in Memmingen. He's a trainee at Schultz... He had nothing on him except an ID card. And he informed already about his personal details. He will only speak to you about any other information he may have. Great! Where is he now? K3, you're expected already. Okay, who is on duty today? Bruck... Mr Steiger! Coffee, thanks a lot! Miss Bruck, I just wanted to ask how far you've already... Mr Steiger, you should know that a proper police identification takes time! Hey, where were you last night? You know what, take your coffee back with you! You do your job and do mine. The young gentleman had this folder with him, have fun with it! Happy Fischertag! How is he? What are the doctors saying? Well, how do you think how he is, he was shot! Shot through the shoulder! His organs and bones are okay, but he still has to do a CT scan. He has taken a hell lot of painkillers so he's not very clear, he's barely responsive. I want the police to come here! Who the fuck was that? The boy in the brook, he suddenly turned up and shot... He was just a boy! Don't know him, no idea! Excuse me? Are you the partner of the victim? My name is Opitz, criminal investigation department Memmingen. May I ask you some questions? Sure! It won't take long. Best regards from Mrs Bruck, she doesn't want you to show up again today. The Police report is completed. Quite a few fingerprints. Analysis ongoing. Have you looked at the folder already? Just flipped through it, news articles, minutes, handwritten records, photos and so on. What is this about? Can you remember the raid on Kudamm in Berlin in 2014? Yes, I think so... a shoot out with our colleagues in Berlin. Exactly, and there are several other raids listed in the same style. Some of them in Germany, some in France and Belgum. Okay, what does the victim say? He's being questioned in hospital right now... Who of us is in the hospital? Opitz! If you have any additional information, please contact me! Alright, thanks! I'd like to get some stuff from the apartment. But I don't know if I can make it after all that's happened... Sure, I understand! Officers? Can you please drive her home and bring her back again, she needs to get some stuff from her apartment. Well... our shift ends in half an hour, and our colleagues are about to relieve us.. Yes, but we'll take care of it. Thanks, good luck to you. Well, what the fuck! This is annoying, not only did I jump in the brook today and I'm still fucking wet, I haven't even eaten yet, and now I'm supposed to play taxi? Are you kidding me? Jesus, Bernhard! What are you doing!? Look at you! What the hell are you doin'? No worries, we'll be fine. Come with me, please. We'll give you a ride to the apartment and bring you back to hospital. We'll look after him, okay? Is this what you have intended? The two of us in one room with your records? These aren't my records, they're my father's. Your father's? But you've added quite a few things! My dad died five years ago. I've just continued his records. Until today, I see. Do you know the shooter? Can I come in? Please wait outside, we're in the middle of an interview. Sure... everything okay Matthias? Cheer up you'll be fine! Well, back to you... You really seem relieved. To me it looks like you've planned everything carefully. This morning was rather spontaneous. Spontaneous? You shot someone! I've never wanted to shoot him dead just hold him! Hold him? I know it sounds weird, but I didn't see any other way. Do you know the victim? Not in person. But what were you aiming at? Like I said, I just wanted to hold him, and I wanted you to listen to me. Well, you could've made that easier! But you never would have believed me! Now you are listening. Okay, I'm listening to you. So you jump in the brook today and shoot a total stranger, no, you want to hold him! Why today? In the brook, at Fischertag? Everyone who was born and raised in Memmingen comes back here today. And this morning at the brook, they were all there. This is not about Matthias, this is about my uncle, Karl! Anything else you noticed? Let me put it this way... this is the story of a wasp nest. It's been hanging in a tree for years, well camouflaged. The wasps come and go and bring home their prey. Once a year, they all come back home to split their spoils. Today, at Fischertag. Now it's my turn. I've been waiting for the right moment to destroy the nest! And what if you don't catch all of them? That's why I'm here. You have to catch the rest of them. Be quiet! We must get out of here! Where are your clothes? Wardrobe. It's been quite a while. Just do what we say! What's this? Room 4. Come on! My uncle is the creative head of this wasp nest. He, his brother Paul and the others have been robbing cash transporters and banks throughout Europe for years. Quite professional but also pretty clever. The investigation authorities have been groping in the dark for years. And it's all recorded in here? Even more. My dad started to collect records and evidence against his brother Karl. A lot of it dates back many years, but it all makes sense. Karl is pretty smart and cautious. He organises the group and plans all the raids. Why did your father never go to the police? Karl is his brother. They were actually pretty close. Maybe he wanted to face him in person... Maybe he did. When did your father die? Oh, you mean Karl...? No. He may have destroyed our family, but he didn't kill my father. Back then in the car my parents argued a lot. Probably about Karl. But I can't remember... I was asleep. You were in the car with them? I was 14 years old, yes. They always talked about Karl. My dad wanted to lead him back on the right track, my mum wanted to break contact and snitch on him. They were somehow inseparable. But... They grew up together. My mum knew Karl and my father since they were little. And then my dad went through the red light and a truck hit the driver's door. My dad died instantly, my mom was in a coma for half a year, she now needs long-term care. I grew up at my aunt's. And Karl? Did he take care of you? Yes, a bit at first, maybe he felt bad. But I didn't want all that. He was very rarely in Memmingen, only at Fischertag. Roman, I need to talk to you for a second. What's up? There was an alarm in the hospital, and a man dead, probably shot. - Who? - Opitz! It's started! The Russian's pretty mad! Stop it! Who was that little motherfucker!? Who was that little motherfucker?!! Do you know who he was? Who? Who was it? Our nephew! Which nephew? Wolfi's son. Wolfi's son? I can't remember him. Hey, we must get out of here. We must get out of here! Of course we have to, but we need to keep cool. Otherwise we're not getting out of this shit anymore! Paul is right, we must stay focused! Come on, it always went well, we were perfect!...well, almost perfect. You always said no one will get wise to us! You always told us! And now I have to put my neck on the line for your fuckin' family? What d'you mean? Fuckin' family it means! Fuck! Wolfi knew it all the time? He knew what we've been pulling here? And then his son, this son of a bitch, shows up and fuckin' shoots him? We are fucked!! Congratulations! That's it! Hold on a second, nothing has happened, right? We'll continue as before! Nobody can link anything to us! No, it's over! The police are after us, Matthias was unstable, we had to play it safe. The boy's in the CID now. I don't know what he knows. Maybe he's telling a story about his uncles Paul and Karl who have always been evil. Our brother Wolfi was an idealist, He couldn't handle what we were doing. Maybe the boy will blow our cover. You know what? I'm leaving! I don't want anything to do with your fuckin' family! Nothing at all! Stay! What? You're right. But please start thinkin', we have to be cool. Calm down, man! Business as usual. Sven, you come with me, Paul, Alex and Matthias you go back to the apartment. Back to the apartment? Why do we have to go back to this jerk's apartment? You go to the apartment, end of story! Because we forgot something important, you fuckin' Russian bastard. Hold on... I don't want anything to do with this, I know nothing about it. Let me explain, it's either this or you'll have to think carefully for the next 20 years whether you wanna pick up the soap in the shower or not, got it? Mobiles, prepaid, all our numbers are stored. Everybody does their job! There's still something I have to sort out... We meet in Lindau, McDonalds in three hours. Alex, are you up for it? Let's go! The manhunt for all five fugitives, is on. I want you to go back to the office immediately, and I want Federle to double check the file again and look for new clues. Contact the State Office of Criminal Investigations. I'll talk again to Jonas. Where is the victim's girlfriend? Can't you curse in German? What do we do now? Wait and see... Hold on, this is too much. I can't do this... Shut up and come with me! Shit! Go and get the boss, now! What was in the bag? A bomb! Just a dummy, I'm not doing anything dangerous! Sven, no time to piss your pants. We need to get through this, get it together. Go! I don't wanna carry a gun, I can't, sorry. Are you okay? Guys, this is taking way too long! Hey Paul, Paul, wait a second! Hey, you can't... Paul, Paul, wait Paul, please... please don't, there must be another way! Man, my girlfriend's up there. Paul, come on, why the weapon? Don't do this, Paul, Paul!! I won't be long... Okay, relax, man! You really like that, don't you? Well come on girl, let's go. It's really time for us to leave. Yes? I won't be long anymore, just one minute. Can you please open the door? Fuck, you bloody idiot! Get down, get cover! Iller 16-14 triggered an emergency call. There was machine gun fire 15 seconds later. Where was it? Let me see. Memmingen, Rosengasse 6! Iller 16-14 was there with a witness coming back from hospital! The shooting at the brook. This is Iller to all. We need support for 16-14 after gun use! Probably several armed perpetrators. Go to Memmingen, Rosengasse 6. Fuck... this bloody bastard... Shit, we have to stop this. What are we doing now? Alex, they're in the bathroom, we can't get in there! Yes, please come up, I need your help. Come on! I can't do it, this is so fuckin' high! Hold me! Please get yourself to safety. Police operation in progress! Iller 16-18 arrived! Thank God, this has only happened to me now. So, it's all been sorted out.. Everything okay? Oh, we were really lucky, we got out of this alive. Your boyfriend leads an interesting double life... Come with me. Bloody hell...! How much is this? About 10 million euros in small notes. Matthias was quite talkative. He told us where the money was hidden, and more details about this group. Every year they settle everything at Fischertag, they split the money Matthias had been laundering for months. Matthias was the financial expert, the money launderer. Karl is the leader, the mastermind. Paul and Alex did the tough work. They committed all the raids. Sven was the IT expert. He infiltrated all the systems and cleared any traces left behind. Don't panic! It's all right. Actually, I'm not supposed to ask you and you don't have to answer, but how long have you been preparing for today? I found my father's records a year ago, just after Fischertag. They were in his study. A whole year, really? I must admit that today was the perfect day to strike. Let's hope the prosecutor will see it the same way. This is Iller! Shooting in Buxheim... Hey, this is at my mother's. Come on, calm down. My colleagues will take care of it. I need to go to the bathroom, I'm sick. He's sick. Are you okay? I can only advise you to behave appropriately and calm. Much has happened in Memmingen today. You set the ball rolling and we were able to catch several criminals. Doesn't look too bad for you. Don't do anything stupid! I am here live at the local court in Memmingen. After the shots in the brook at Memmingen's Fischertag, the alleged offender is being brought before the judge right now. In about a week... in an hour... what's happening? Gimme the keys! - Please tell me you've got that. - I have everything! This is just awesome! Hey auntie, it's me. I'll explain this later to you... listen now! Karl's with mom in Buxheim in the retirement home! I'll explain later... Come over here now! Iller for 16-21! There's blood at the windscreen. What do you think, are things always as obvious as they seem? You are angry, angry with me because I destroyed your happiness. I was also angry because I didn't get what I loved. With all the injustice in the world, what difference does another injustice make? So, what now? Do you want to avenge your father, by killing your father? In every piece of injustice, there is a piece of justice. I'm feeling justice today, and love, the love of a father... When will they finally get here? No idea... And what am I supposed to do here? It was you who wanted to meet up. Me? Definitely not. Good morning. Winkler, Federal Attorney Office Karlsruhe. Would you and Mrs lawyer, be so kind and bring me a cup of coffee? But my client has expl... With milk please... I don't care about coffee. Me neither. But maybe you care about an offer from the Federal Chief Attorney... Things often are not what they seem.
