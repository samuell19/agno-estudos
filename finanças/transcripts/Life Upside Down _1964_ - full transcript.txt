ITALIAN FILM CRITICS AWARD AND BEST FIRST WORK AWARD AT THE VENICE FILM FESTIVAL 1964 FEMINA AWARD 1964 WRITERS GUILD AWARD AT THE CANNES FESTIVAL 1964 It's always difficult to know how it starts. If I remember well, it started on an afternoon, two months ago. I had just closed a deal. Two idiots had exchanged their 1bd apartments. One dump for another one. Since I had nothing else to do, I went home. Always the same mess. Viviane will definitely never change. I thought I could take a bath. I was feeling good. I hadn't been by myself in a while, like this, in the middle of the week. Hi honey, how are you? How was your day? It was crazy at work. I had a photo shoot. I went shopping. And guess who I see while I was leaving? Georges! Where is the bottle opener? Here. Jacques? Jacques! Do you hear me? My ad is playing at the Moulin Rouge. Shall we? We shall. Really, yes, really… it's not like the others. BATH TIME Here, it's mine! Look at my close-up. It's one of my best, no? HERCULES VS DAVID Come on, let's leave. No, Hercules. I beg you, don't leave. I have to, my dear. I have to. Kiss me. I like your mouth. Oh, Hercules! My Hercules! I'll have two sausages with fries and a beer. And you? -A beer. -No food? No. Viviane! Hi! -Hi, you. -Hi. -We saw you. It's great. -Really? Yes, it is very pretty. -And my close-up? -It was wonderful. -You're nice. -No. Don't you find her amazing? I do. Excuse me. -What do you think? -Of course, you're great. All of a sudden, like earlier in the room, I felt good. All that mattered were the little light and the ball. Jacques! What's with you today? The next day, I woke up in a good mood. Le Gai Logis, real estate agency. Here it is. That's where I work. Saint-Michel. Beautiful two bedroom apartment, kitchen, bathroom. Convention. Beautiful studio. Shower as an option. -Montmartre… -Good job, Jacques. I am happy to see you at work this early. You are worthy of our trust. I assure you that you won't regret it. Thanks to our team efforts, Le Gai Logis will soon become the first real estate agency of Montmartre. And it's just the beginning. On one side, the head that synchronizes… Mister Kerbel, please. Your wife is not here, and there are no clients. Don't waste your time. -Hello, Jacques. -Hello, madam. Pierre. Don't you think you could get dressed? Saint-Michel. Beautiful two bedroom apartment, kitchen, bathroom. Convention. Beautiful studio. Shower as an option. Montmartre. Three bedroom, fully equipped, breathtaking view. It started again in the afternoon. I was giving tours, and taking tours. For me, this day, like the other, was as if I was entering a massive hallway that was leading to a lot of rooms, full of aromas of cooking, furniture polish, ladies in bath robes, family meals, beds undone. -Good evening, honey. -Good evening. Viviane, give me more smile. You've never slept in sheets like that. Don't hide the edging, that would upset the client. Well, it's good. Thank you. -Goodbye, sweetie. -Goodbye. Have dinner with us. I'll phone Nicole. Not today, I am dead. -You can go. -No, I am staying. -Come since he says you can. -No, thank you. I'll need the sheets back. I'll leave the stuff here. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -What's wrong? -I spent my day in this bed. I am fed up. I would have liked to have spent mine here too. It's good. It's very good. I think I like this record because everybody hates it. Jacques! Stop it or I'll go crazy. I can't say exactly how it came. Maybe I simply thought that I wasn't nice to her. And then, I really pitied her. So, only to see her smile, I said: Viviane, how about we get married? I had said this almost without realizing it. It was only the next day that I realized the mess I had put myself in. Hello. I am sorry to bug you, honey. I went to the city hall. You have a lot of papers to sign. Here. This one is for your birth certificate. Did you see the bathroom? It's all in marble. Can you imagine? This one is a declaration saying you are not married. The bedroom is facing south. You'll have the sun all day. And then, for the witnesses… Listen. Be a little discreet. It is at Denfert-Rochereau. -We'll have to invite them. -You will miss out. Look. She heard everything. See, I told you so. I want to be the first one to congratulate you. Thank you, madam. All right. I'm off. Jacques, you can go. It's only half an hour to lunch time. Thank you, madam. Come back at 3pm. -It's only normal given the news. -Thank you. I want to congratulate you as well. Thank you, sir. I need to think about my dress. -Maybe white. -That's an excellent idea. So, we'll get married at the Madeleine, with the organs and all. I like beautiful music. And it'll make me feel I am marrying a true maid. Stop teasing me! We'll have to decide on food too. I don't know if I will wear a hat or not. Nicole will be my maid of honor. We'll invite Fernand of course. How about the parents? Listen, Viviane. Do what you want, but no parents. It's our wedding. They don't care about us. We'll write to them afterwards. Bye. Well. Another one. I liked the atmosphere of this room. It smelt like sweat and grime, but it was nice. Turn. Well done. -Hi, Paul. -How are you? I am getting married. -No way. -Yes, that's true. Stop the long face. I don't get it. How strange. -With who? -Viviane. What? Would you at least agree on being my best man? I can't. I am going to Spain for a month. Jacques. Ina. Look at him. This man is getting married. -She's cute. -Yes. You realize what you'll lose? -When did you decide it? -A few days ago. And why? Maybe to have a clean conscience. -How about you? You're happy? -Yes, I think so. I spoke for a moment with Paul. At the end, he was my only friend. But we never saw each other. It was maybe for the best. Well, bye. Think about it again. Will do. THE GROOM THE BEST MAN, THE GUEST Honey, can you zip me up? -You're very pretty, you know? -Hurry. No, Jacques! We're going to be late. You're crazy! Jacques! Jacques, you're crazy. No, Jacques! Jacques! Article 214: If the spouses do not have agreements on their contribution to the family's need, they agree to contribute in proportion to their respective abilities. Article 215: The husband will decide on the household's residence. Mister Claude René Libérial, do you take Miss Jacqueline Anna Robin to be your wife? Yes. Miss Jacqueline Anna Robin, do you take Claude René Libérial to be your husband? Yes. In the name of the law, I now pronounce you husband and wife. -It's not too obvious, is it? -No. Wedding Valin-Calvot, would please come forward? Come forward, miss. The bride. The groom. Parents and witnesses of the bride. Parents and witnesses of the groom. You may sit, ladies and gentlemen. Could you please stand up? May the future spouses approach the mayor? Welcome to our city hall. Here is an extract of the civil code on the responsibilities of the spouses. Article 212: The spouses agree to be faithful, and to provide each other support. Article 213: The husband is the head of the family, with the well being of the couple and children at heart. The wife, alongside the husband, is responsible for the moral and material direction of the family, for its support, as well as for the education of their children. Mister Jacques Valin, do you take as your wife Miss Viviane Calvot? Yes. Miss Viviane Calvot, do you take for your husband Mister Jacques Valin? Yes. In the name of the law, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Stop looking at the camera. Look at your husband. -Really? -That's it. Be careful. I will publish it in Cinémonde. It's on me! -Cheers! -Cheers! My sweetie pie. My sugar, you're the most handsome, once again. My sweetie pie! Tell me, Jacques, aren't you from Brittany? No, madam. That's odd. I've known some Valins in Plougastel who were associated with my great grandparents. This isn't strange, madam. My family comes from Poland. Valin is an abbreviation of Valinowsky. Yes. My grandfather was even very famous. Really? He died at the gallows. He was an anarchist, a little bit of a satyr. He specialized in bombs and little girls. I think he preferred the little girls to politics. It's awful. Rest assured, madam, I have not inherited his flaws. Does Viviane look like a little girl? It's ready, you can go upstairs. Again, I started to feel good. Like the other day. I wasn't thinking about anything. Are you coming? No, I'm out. They are pissing me off. We can't. It's not proper. -It is. -Jacques, you are crazy! I may be, but I am out of here. Tell them sorry for us, my husband is not feeling well, we're leaving. Is your real name really Valinowsky? No, it was a joke. GIRLS FOR A VAMPIRE EVERY DAY After that, I didn't want to go home. We went to a hotel. On the record, I wrote: "Mister and Missus Valin." We were married! Hello. Jacques… Are you keeping Mr. Bareau in mind? Yes, madam. Have you found something for him? I think so, yes. -It's urgent, you know. -Yes, I know. Could you maybe give him a call? I will call him in a little bit, madam. And you think he will wait? Why not? Where are you going? I'm going to get his file. You fear that I am going to leave? We never know with you. That's true. But I came back, you see. Yes, and without apologies! Would that make a difference? Pierre, you are letting him speak to me that way? Calm down, darling. I want you to talk to him right now. Jacques, since yesterday my wife and I have done a lot of thinking. I think you'll understand… Well, it's difficult to explain… But after what you did yesterday, we can no longer trust you. In short, Mister Kerbel, I am fired. -Not this second. You can… -I know. Don't worry, I am leaving. Your pay. Goodbye, it was a pleasure! -One coffee. -Yes, sir. Jacques… -I am sorry. -There's no need to be. If it had been only my choice, I would have never done this. But with my wife… You know she's the owner of the agency. I am not going to console you for firing me. In any event, if it makes you feel better, I am not mad at you. -Really? -Really. Well, I feel better. Come on, let's have a drink. One Suze. -And for you, Jacques? -I'm good. When I think about my wife's face after the wedding! That was something. Yes, it must have been. I need to go. She could come downstairs. Goodbye, Jacques. By the way, I almost forgot… That's for you. Viviane didn't seem to be there. After all, it was maybe best not to tell her. I had money. We were good for a month. Deep down, I was happy. What was happening was what I had always wanted but never dared to do. With my little bouquet, I sure looked like a good little husband. Hello? Hi, honey. I am sorry, I have another photo shoot. I won't be home before 11 o'clock. There's some kidneys on the stove. You can heat that up. Well, see you later. -You're alright? -I am alright. -You love me? -I love you. Viviane had won this at a beauty pageant. And here is Miss Camembert! I liked Viviane right away. She was the type of women I dreamt of when I was a kid. A beauty model. You're dancing very well. -I am sure you'll work in films. -Why? -You work in films? -No, in real estate. That's great! I am looking for a place. I think I had never seen anything so pretty. Who knows? I might have married her because of her feet. Hold me tight, my love. Come on, be a little tender with me. My darling… I love you so much! You know, by the way, I was fired. That's too bad, I wanted to go. Jacques didn't want to… Viviane was talking to Nicole. It was probably going to be long. I wanted to leave before she asked me to go out with her. You're sweet. Love you. Bye. Fernand is lending us his car. We could go to the countryside. -Isn't it wonderful? -Yes. I would dream of the countryside all year. And once there, I would be bored. The sparrows and weeping willows didn't move me. Jacques? Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! We're leaving. You did it on purpose. See you tonight, honey. I am going to look for work. Bye. A lemonade. Beautiful two bedroom, kitchen, bath. Great studio, big balcony, ready to move in. Four bedroom, 1400 sq, astonishing view. Give me my pullover. You look great. Did you get married? No, I flaked last minute. You did good. I don't think marriage is for you. I agree. I can't stand feeling trapped. Who are you with now? Guess. I don't know. -I am with a Chinese. -For real? Paul! Let's rehearse your entrance. Lights on! Paris, Rome, Madrid, in all the capitals… -Call me. Let's hang out soon. -Yes, let's do that. You all know him. Here is Paul Curel and his flying trapeze! Go ahead. He was a real acrobat. He would never really come down from his trapeze. He took my photo, then he wanted to sleep with me. I had warned you. I don't care if he's the boss, I'll kick his ass! Listen to him, we can't say anything without… -Good evening, honey. -Good evening. Cheers! I am sure you're still thinking about the wedding. But it's old news now. No, because… Help yourself. They were mad at me. The only way around it was to give Fernand something to talk about. Fernand, did you read the last Auto-Journal on the Ferrari GT? -Yes. -What did you think? It's not bad. But, you see… It's a 2953 cc, 240 hp at 7000 rpm. So it goes up to 155 mph like that. But, my Dauphine, in all proportions, is performing better than it. Ask Nicole how much time it took us to go to Porte d'Ivry. Not even five minutes. So, on highways… Compression ratio, 9:1. I swear! -The valves… -Here he goes. We were good for a while. With the double clutching… Vacuum servo, drum brake. Single disc clutch. Downdraft carburetor. Power steering. V engine. Cheer up, sweetie pie. Listen. Nicole cooed like a big quail. Everybody was happy. Sure. Of course. Yes. Sure. What did you do today? Did you find something? No, I walked around. -You walked around? -Yes, I walked around. OK. You may be right. You need to relax. I had never found the noise she made while sleeping quite so loud. I went to Vincennes three days in a row to look at a funny tree that seemed to burst in every direction. You're a fan, I see. It's one of our most beautiful specimens. This catalpa, called "catalpa bignonioide", grows in the wild along water streams in the south of America. It was introduced in France in 1790. It is not to be confused with the paulownia which… -If you're interested, we have some… -No, I don't care. I would even say that I hate trees. I tried to stare at his eyes, but without looking at him. Why are you staring at me? This afternoon, I tried something. I think I was able to remove the people I was looking at. What? Yes, my dear. A lot is possible when you want it. I was already able to give life to a tree. Now, I can make people invisible. You're joking or you're crazy. No, I swear. Here, I will try with you. At this moment, I am looking at you… I don't see you. Instead of learning to unsee, open your eyes. You didn't notice I changed my hair color. Another day, it seemed that I hadn't looked at myself in a mirror for ten years. A few more white hairs, and I'll look like a real ladies' man. It's me? Yes, it's me. Me, indeed. -What are you doing? -I am looking at myself. It's interesting. I'm sure you've never noticed that your left nostril is slightly bigger than the other. -No, you're joking? -Absolutely not. That would keep her busy for the day. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11… Weird. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14… 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13… "Looking for hostess, lady with good presentation." "Hospital is looking for an experienced midwife." "Governess, housekeeper, janitor, nude model…" "Seeking mechanical specialist, machine operator, cable operator, welder, milling cutter, engineer, director…" "Seven thousand francs per month." You should be careful, you know. -There's nothing else to eat. -It's that bad? No. It's just that I won't get paid for another few days. -And you're not helping… -Don't worry. I am looking a lot. I even received several offers, more or less interesting. Mechanical specialist, metal worker, welder, bonder, milling cutter. But I said no to all that. I think I will accept a place of director for 7 000 francs per month. -You're joking? -Not at all. It's a new agency that's opening on the Champs-Élysées. So, you see, with my references, they didn't hesitate. It would be wonderful. I can't believe it. Money is that important to you? No. As long as I am with you, nothing matters. You realize what we could do? -What? -I don't know… I've never thought about that. First, we could get a bigger apartment. A four bedroom. Because I want lots of kids. Why are you smiling? I think that by putting money aside, I could also help you get leading roles in movies. In color films, I hope! Yes. In color films and in CinemaScope if you want. And later, we would buy a little house in the countryside. Next to a river. I like water. I'd do gardening. There would be tons of flowers, some animals, the kids. I don't care about furs. Or something discreet. A pelisse, a mink or beaver fur-trimmed coat. It's not showy, of course, but it's better. All the pleasure is for oneself. Stop. You're tickling me! For a moment, I didn't recognize her. Kiss me. Sorry. By keeping my eyes open, I was able to see in the dark. -Jacques? -Yes? Nothing. It's true. I could see differently. I would stare at anything for hours. I would discover shapes, lines, that I've never seen before. I would forget the object itself. I walked through the crowd. And when I wanted, I made the people disappear, I muted them. I changed the scenery that I knew too well. HITACHI 1963 TRANSISTORS SOLD EXCLUSIVELY HERE I wanted to see the day rise. I made the night, and I remade the day, at will. I wasn't drunk. But I was becoming lighter, bigger. -Jacques. -Yes? Honey, you're finally here. I am so happy you came back. What is there to eat? You haven't cooked dinner? That's alright, I'll have some cheese. You're not hungry? You're sure you don't want any? Do you think I could eat? What's wrong? Why are you standing here with your hat on your head? Do you know what you told me since you're back? I said hi. I asked if you were hungry and why you were wearing your hat. -That's it. -Yes, that's it. Don't you think I have been worried for three days? Three days? Do you think I had been peacefully waiting for you? I was looking for you. I called the hospitals. I almost called the police. -You come back after three days… -Three days? That can't be right. It's impossible. I left this morning. This morning! Sure, this morning! Look at you! It's unbelievable. Really unbelievable. You don't understand? Let me explain. I am happy. So many things happened to me. I want to tell you everything. You see, it's strange. -I haven't lived for many years. -Thank you! It's only now that I feel I'm taking the time to live… to discover something else. Before, I was nibbling at the days. Now, three days feel like one day. -How is she? -Who? The woman you're seeing. You're shrugging? That's too easy. I've been waiting for you. Look at my eyes! I didn't stop crying. And you're talking about what? "For years, I didn't live. I am taking the time to live." Why did you marry me? Tell me why! You never tell me anything, it's not fair. I have the right to know. I want to live too! You hear? I want to live! I exist! I am patient though. I love you. I've never asked you anything. You're not listening to me. If you leave, I warn you, I'll kill myself. Right. What an idiot. A real idiot. She'll never understand. They are all like that. At the end… you're the only one I get along with. He goes out while I wait for him! Who worries? Who is restless? Will you stop? Will you shut up? No, I won't. It would be too easy. According to the location of my bedroom, I deducted that it was the woman I was watching when I was home. I didn't want to get to know her anymore. Look out, here he is. No, you can't come in. But this is my home. You are the husband? Come. There. Everything will be fine now. This man is the husband. Very well. Give her this. I'll stop by this evening. -Goodbye, sirs. -Goodbye, doctor. You wife tried to kill herself by inhaling gas. You're lucky. The whole house could have exploded. I am a police detective. I have a few questions for you. Where were you last night? At the hotel, nearby. Did you two have an argument? No, I needed a change of scenery. Have you been married long? Two weeks, more or less. Profession? Real estate agent. At least until two weeks ago. And now? I don't have one. And your wife? -My wife? -What's her profession? Artist. That's all for today. You'll need to come sign your statement of course. See you soon. I was crushed. There was no doubt, she truly loved me. I wasn't alone anymore. -Need anything, Mister Valin? -No, thank you. Jacques? Jacques! I love you. My God! Poor thing, even delirious, she couldn't be a good tragedian. It's crazy! Jacques! Mom! I think she's out of danger now. She'll need to be watched, she could do it again. -Something to drink? -No, thank you. Jacques… -Goodbye. -Goodbye, doctor. Jacques! You're here? -Are you married? -Yes. -Good luck. -Stay! Don't leave! Stay, Jacques! I love you so. Be nice with me. Mom! Jacques! MY DEAR MOTHER, Mother… Here are some chocolate and oranges for the trip. My poor darling, seeing you leaving like this, alone… I beg you, get a grip. I don't matter, you know. But you? What is going to happen to my Jacquot in Paris, alone? And your father… What is he going to do? He doesn't care. As long as nobody touches his car. That's the last image I had of him. I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. I GOT MARRIED TWO WEEKS AGO. I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU BEFORE BECAUSE I WANTED IT TO BE A SURPRISE. TWO WEEKS AFTER HER WEDDING A COVER-GIRL ATTEMPTED SUICIDE That was good publicity for her. Do you want something to drink? Look, they're talking about you everywhere. The pictures look great. Please close the shutters, there's too much light. Mister Valin! Wake up, mister Valin! Your wife is cured. What's going on? Who are you? It's me, the doctor. The doctor? Your wife was very sick. -Don't you remember? -No. The gas, the police? Yes, I remember… It's crazy, I had totally forgotten about it. How long have I been like this? Since yesterday morning. One day. Don't get up. I know the way. Don't forget, you should rest. You need it. Goodbye. -I'll come back this week. -Goodbye, doctor. Her toe was slowly changing color, like a big exotic insect. The doctor is right, we could go on a trip. On the Côte d'Azur… In Brittany… Or abroad, in Italy for example. I've been dreaming about it. It will be our honeymoon, at last. You and me… You're very nice after all, my poor Jacques. You were probably looking like this, as a kid, when you were lying to your parents. You're really trying, but what's the point? It's over. I'll always get by. -But you? -Don't worry about me. Everybody should leave me alone. I don't need anybody anymore. It's too complicated to explain, you wouldn't understand. That's true, I am stupid. But I know it. If I wasn't, you would never have loved me. After all the years spent together, I am starting to know you. Even a smart person couldn't understand you. You are somewhere else. I took a good look at them, once more. What's the date? The tenth. PARIS, JULY 10TH, 1963 DEAR SIR, I… Jacques? Yes? You're mad at me for this morning? No, you were right, I think. I was upset. I didn't mean everything I said. Hello? It's you. Good evening. Yes, I am feeling much better. Jacques is good. No, it's impossible. No, I assure you… Don't get upset! Yes, that's it. Yes, I will let you know. No, nothing more. I'll explain later. That's what I'm saying. Jacques! Come. I brought you four pack of crispbread. Sardines, cheese, rice, tea, coffee, jam… raviolis… pasta… and condensed milk. At least with that, you won't starve. TURN THE GAS OFF AFTER USE MATCHES ARE IN THE OVEN TAKE OUT THE TRASH FROM TIME TO TIME It was really over. She was putting her mask back on. The car is downstairs. You're a real bastard. Goodbye. I almost forgot… I left some money in the dresser. Furniture is like trees, like bushes. If you don't pay attention, they'll take over. That day, I realized that, if we truly want it, walls don't exist anymore. We make them transparent. Now, I got it. I'm sure of it, I know the secret. I needed to be alone to truly know it. All it takes is to cross to the other side. It's a matter of will. But who would dare? People, for example, eat. All they do is eat. Me, in two weeks, I've only had a tube of condensed milk and a pack of crispbread. Yet I feel great. I can jump, exercise. I am not lying. Hunger strike? It's nothing. Fakirs? Bullshit. It's all about discipline… It's about saving one's energy, no useless movement, like wild animals. But one must know. One must learn. And nobody teaches us. I was lucky. And I must be talented. People don't know how to look at themselves anymore. If they did, they would be scared, they would get dizzy. They don't know themselves anymore. I am sure you haven't tried it, doctor. When we truly look at ourselves, we can't fake it anymore. We start to live. Because hear me out: everything lives. A foot, a lamp, a hand… And when, like me, we've crossed over to the other side, nothing… I mean, there's no boredom because everything is possible. Everything becomes bright. We discover a new world. People don't know how to see, don't know how to breathe, don't know how to hear. They also forget about the noises. Don't smile, I am right. I assure you I am right. When I was in school, our teacher would often mention a philosopher who said that men's sorrows come from them not being able to live between four walls. I can. I am happy. I can do everything I want. I can dance alone, talk alone… Even laugh alone. I am very happy. I am so happy, I could cry. And I will always be even more. Yes… Now, I got it. I am sure of it, I know the secret. I needed to be alone to truly know it. All it takes is to cross to the other side. It's a matter of will. But who would dare? And when, like me, we've crossed over to the other side, nothing… There's no boredom anymore because everything is possible. Everything becomes bright. We discover a new world. It's very pretty. I am amazed at my prose. I can leave it with you if you'd like. Thank you. Try to talk about what has been happening to you over the past two months. Why? One of my friends, a very wealthy man, is interested by these kind of experiences. He is an original. And if he likes what he hears, he'll offer you a room in his house, near Paris. No more worries for you. You'll have lodging and food until you finish your story. A true dream, really. What do you say? I'm happy to try. I'll come back in a few days. Goodbye. Goodbye, doctor. My name is Jacques Valin. Jacques… Jacques Valin. My name is Jacques Valin. Jacques Valin. My name is Jacques Valin. Jacques… Jacques Valin… My name is… Hello, Jacques? Hello? Hello? Say something. I know you're here. Jacques? Are you alright? Are you eating well? Are you being careful with the gas? Jacques? Jacques, my darling. Are you going to stay inside forever? Can't you find happiness elsewhere? Try to pretend at least. If it's about work, you may find one that you like. I will help you. You think you're invincible, you're driven. -But soon, you won't want anything. -Come sit down. You really don't want to go out? After all… You may be right. It's probably another of Viviane's tricks to get me out. They can't stand seeing me happy and alone. Here are the facts: a funny-looking woman came in. She looked like my mom, but as a caricature. Jacques, my boy! Honey, don't you recognize me? It's me, your mother. Jacques! Don't you recognize me? It's awful. My God! It's awful. He doesn't recognize his mother. His own mother! His mother who cradled him, consoled him, loved him, raised him, made him a man. It's awful! I will never get over it! You're all I have left, my love, now that your dad is gone. I would have preferred for him to rob me, beat me, kill me, but not this! She was a little over the top. But she was so into her role that I decided to make her happy. Yes, mom, I recognize you. My Jacquot! Stay there. My boy, you're finally back! It's not nice to upset your old mother like this. Tell me, my darling. You'll need to introduce me to your wife. She wasn't a great actress, but she had some very good moments. The beginning of my story appealed to the doctor's friend. He invited me to his house. I will finally have peace. I have a very nice bedroom. Very clear, very white… like in a clinic. Viviane, disguised as a nurse, came to give me food. Since I am here, I haven't touched the tape recorder. I need to make this last. I am happy. I could stay like that, for a very long time, without doing anything… I got them, finally. Subtitle translation by: Sophie Céneray
