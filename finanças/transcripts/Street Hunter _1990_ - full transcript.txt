Well, what do you say, partner? Think we can take him? (SNIFFS) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Come on, come on, hurry up. LOUIS: Well, well, well. Que pasa, Angel? What brings you around this neck of the woods, huh? Que pasa, eh? Que pasa? Romano, you got no business here, man. Why don't you just tell your old man to go fuck off. My old man? You fucking leave my old man out of this, you got that, scumbag? Let me guess, you came here tonight to visit your fucking mother's grave, and you just happened to stumble across our stash, right? It's a very stupid move, amigo. Stupid, huh? Stupid, you're gonna call me stupid? Stupid in front of my friends? (LAUGHS) Well, doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. That's right, it doesn't matter. Because you and the rest of your fucking scumbags are going to die now anyway. So it don't matter, you're dead. Five dead scumbags. Hey, boys. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GUNS COCKING) LOUIS: Who's this? Oh, shit. All right, guys. I take that back. Hey, Louis. I want you to meet a dear and close personal friend of mine. El Colonel Walsh. Farewell! Ahhh! (MACHINE GUN FIRING) Ahhh! (GROANS) Nice, nice, nice. I'm impressed, man. You turned my little posse into a serious death force, you know? You know, you're almost worth all the money I pay you, man. (CHUCKLES) Don't touch me. Okay, okay. There's more to it than the money. It's the taste of triumph, the ecstasy of glory. Understand that, Angel, the fortunes of world will be with you. Sure, sure, you're the Colonel. (CHUCKLES) So, what's next? You have one more to exterminate. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Angel, don't shoot. I don't have a fucking gun. Don't shoot me, Angel. I haven't got a gun. -What are you waiting for? -No, wait, I want to play a little. Play if you must, then kill him. Vamonos! LOUIS: Angel, there's fucking no need to get violent, okay? You know what I'm saying? I mean, all you got to do is talk to my old man and he'll pay you. He'll give you whatever you want. He'll pay you, trust me, trust me. Well, your old man's gonna fucking pay for it, motherfucker. He's gonna pay for it when I'm through. 'Cause you're not gonna call me stupid anymore, motherfucker. I'm sorry! You're the one that's fucking stupid, -you garlic-stinking, pepperoni motherfucker! -(LOUIS SCREAMING) -You stupid motherfucker. -Ow, fuck! I'm sorry, please don't fucking kill me, man. You're gonna be fucking stone-cold dead, man. I mean, I'm gonna piss on every fucking one of your fucking graves. Come on. This ain't right, man, I can do whatever the fuck you want. Anything. -You like... -Here, take my fucking watch. You like Walsh's work, huh, Louis? He is a fucking mercenary, man. He went to Angola, Beirut, Salvador, man. He turned my Diablos into a fucking army, you pussy. That's right, I'm a pussy, man. What's the matter, little pretty boy? You scared now? Yeah, I'm fucking scared! Don't fucking kill me, please! (WHIMPERS) Please, I don't want to fucking die. You can take whatever you fucking want, you scumbag. I swear to God, you won't fucking get away with this, you scumbag. My fucking old man'll have your balls tomorrow! Shut the fuck up, you asshole! Please don't do it. Angel, please. God... (COCKS GUN) ANGEL: This city is mine. (WHIMPERS) No... (GUNSHOT) That's quite a mess you made there, Angel. (GUNS COCKING) You guys look like garbage men, why don't you clean it up? What the fuck is this, a block party, man? That pile of brains looks remotely like Louis Romano, hmm? (CLICKS TONGUE) That's him. You know, old Don Mario is gonna be very, very pissed. You're taking his coke, killing his son, his only son. Tell you what. Why don't you let me do you a favor? Just come back with me. That way you'll be a lot safer in jail than in the streets. (CHUCKLES) Logan fucking Blade. (LAUGHS) Fuck Don Mario, man, and fuck you, Blade. (CHUCKLES) Come on, Angel. Look, you got a job to do, I got a job to do, right? So... You coming or what? You got some big cojones, man. To stand there empty-handed, expecting to take me in, right? That's a fucking good one. Look, wait, wait, I'm frightened, man. (LAUGHS) Look, I'm scared shitless. Oh! Yeah. (WHISTLES) (DOG PANTING) -(GROWLING) -(MAN GROANS) Ow! (GUNSHOT) (GROWLING) Munch, down! (GUNSHOTS) Beef jerky, Angel? Go ahead, take them. They're good. Now then... (SIGHS) So... You coming or what? Don't let your fucking dog bite me, all right? -(DOG SNARLS) -(CHUCKLES) Munch doesn't bite people. He eats them. RADIO COMMENTATOR: In a continuing administration effort to curb drug traffic, the President today proposed another increase in aid to Columbia, Bolivia and Peru. Speaking before Congress, the President vowed to escalate the war against drugs both home and abroad. He cited the latest polls that reveal Americans believe the drug problem to be the single most important issue facing our nation in the '90s. The polls also showed that an overwhelming majority of Americans blame drugs for the breakdown of law and order in our streets. The President urged Americans to co-operate with law enforcement officials by reporting known drug dealers to local or federal authorities. ANGEL: Get your hands off me, you slimy old pig. I've got an army behind me. They'll find out where you live, they're gonna find out your family and kill them all. POLICE OFFICER: All right, move it. (GROANS) Ahh! Let me out of here, let me out of here! You don't know who you're dealing with! You got families, huh? You got families? I'm gonna kill them all. I'm gonna kill all your babies, your mother, your father, all of them! I swear to God, I'm gonna kill them in their sleep, I swear on my mother! Son of a thousand fathers, they're all bastards just like you. Come on, let me out, man. Come on, let me out of here, let me out! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Let me out of here, damn it. Let me out of here! -But I... -No, no. No "but's." Out there on the streets, I'm the boss, I call the shots, you understand that? Yes, sir. You know that guy? Logan Blade. He's a damn good cop. And? Well, they say he was set up. He was acquitted, but he resigned anyway. To become a bounty hunter. Jesus. But if he was innocent, why didn't he just stay on the Force? Because they questioned his integrity. And I can't say that I blame him. Well, just as well, the guy was always a lone wolf. You could take a few lessons from him. Great job, Logan. They kept Angel pretty well hidden there for a month. I'll have the department process your reward first thing in the morning. Now, you see, that's what I like about you, my friend. You cut through all the red tape and the BS. -And I thank you very much. -The feeling's mutual, buddy. What you gonna do to that boy Angel? I'm gonna send him to the city jail. We can nail him this time. Drug trafficking, suspicion of murder, and about a half dozen of other charges. (CLICKS TONGUE) Well... Angel's into some heavy jelly. There's more to him than these charges. Yeah, like the Romanos. CAPTAIN RIVERA: What you got for me? Multiple homicide. Louis Romano and six of his goons over at Holy Redeemer Cemetery. Weapons? Automatic casings all over the place. Yeah, it was quite a massacre. -You were there? -I thought you guys'd never ask. We're asking now, Blade. Angel had a little help from his friends. He knew what they were doing, too, very military. -One guy was a mercenary. -Mercenary? Oh, what a crock of shit. Now, who do you think you're kidding there? Uh, let him talk, Wellman. Put a check on a guy named Walsh. Ex-Special Forces. Angel called him "Colonel," but I don't think he's been in the army for quite some time. -CAPTAIN RIVERA: You're sure about this, Logan? -Very sure. Oh, this is just great. (SIGHS) The Mob versus the Diablos. Thanks, Logan. I'll be in touch. Hey, wait a minute. Where do you think you're going? -Better chill out your partner, brother. -Uh, Wellman... Listen. If you got more to tell, mister, you better start talking. 'Cause I can cite you for obstruction of justice. Take it easy, Wellman. I'll be talking to you, Logan. Mmm-hmm. I don't trust him, Captain. Well, I've known Logan Blade for long time and I trust him. I don't like him or his attitude. He's a goddamn vigilante. Oh, you're afraid he's gonna steal your thunder? -No, I uh... -You two have nothing to do? -We got plenty to do, Captain. -Well then, get to it. Come on, Wellman. Blade. Just because you were once on the Force, don't think you can do whatever the heck you want. Yeah. They say you got framed. You know what I say? I say you got too goddamn big for your own good and needed to take a fall. -Hey, come on, that's it. -No, no. Wait, wait, wait. If, uh... You're not careful, well, I think you'll be knocked down again. Just get your reward and keep out of the Diablo-Romano war. You hear me? You know, Wellman, you always had a lot of balls. Make sure you don't lose them. -(CHUCKLES) -Hey, Wellman, he's not kidding. -Logan... -Hmm? He's a cop. Yeah. Pow! Hey, hey, come on, Wellman, what are you so concerned with this guy for, huh? Come on, take it easy. How are you feeling, cowboy? You headed Angel off at the pass. (BOTH LAUGH) -Jannelli. Che se dice? -(SPEAKING ITALIAN DIALECT) Hey, listen, that is one bad boy that you're babysitting, okay? He has a lot of friends and they're mean mamajamas. Mamajamas? You never change, do you, Blade? Still paranoid. (CHUCKLES) Just cautious, my friend. -You sound like my wife, for Christ sakes. -How is she doing? -Still breaking my chops. -You deserve it. -When you see her, you give her my love, okay? -I will. All right. You be careful. Don't worry about a thing. I'll have this scumbag over to city jail. No problema. (SIGHS) Just watch your ass. For me. -I will watch my ass. -(LAUGHS) POLICE OFFICER: Ambush! POLICE OFFICER: Get out of the way. Team one. (GUNFIGHT) Team two. (GUNFIGHT CONTINUES) Move out! What took you so long, man? I said move out, Angel. That means you, mister. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) -Hi. -Hello. (CLEARS THROAT) You come here often? Oh, not as often as I'm supposed to. (LAUGHS) (SIGHS) TRACEY: Have you heard her before? LOGAN: Oh, a few times. What's your name? -Logan. -Tracey. -Nice to meet you, Tracey. -Very nice to meet you also. Would you like to buy me a drink? Uh, yeah, what would you like? Beat it, little girl, before I clog you. You're gonna get the man in deep shit. Do you see that beautiful woman there? (CHUCKLES SHEEPISHLY) That's my lady. Sorry. Yeah, okay. Well... (CLEARS THROAT) -Maybe some other time. -(CHUCKLES) LOGAN: Maybe. I'm sure it could be nice. Welcome to Days and Nights. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome the very talented and very lovely, Denise. (PIANO PLAYING) * One last chance * To feel the magic * Before you disappear * When you hear that haunting music * That echoes through the years * One more time -What's up brother Daze? -Hey, Blade. -Same old same. -(SIGHS) Yeah, it is. -You know, your lady's been sounding extra sweet lately. -Yeah * That romance * It's not too late * For this one * last chance She's pure gold, man. -And gold is hard to find these days. -(SIGHS) You know this. Yeah, I know this. I can't argue with you on that. Gold's the future, brother. And you better invest while you can. (STUTTERS) Eh... *...was all you needed * Just one * last * chance (APPLAUSE) Damn. That's a bad van, man. -Yeah, let's get it, man. -No way, man. This belong to that dude Blade. He's a street hunter, man. I mean, he's a bad motherfucker. I saw him blow some cat away. Serious, man. I don't give a shit who it is. We could take this shit and really party. No, man, come on. Put that back in your pocket, man. Come on. -Man, shut up. -What you doing? Wilson! (KNOCK ON DOOR) LOGAN: It's me, baby. -(CONTINUES KNOCKING) -Honey. It's Logan. Logan who? I don't know any Logan. LOGAN: Come on, baby, let me in. I'm sorry about last night. I'm really, really sorry. -(DOOR OPENS) -Can I come in? Hi, I'm inside. Okay, I'm just closing the door, putting my jacket down, get comfortable, and I move my left foot, moving my right foot. Look at my new shirt that I bought so you can see, you can be very happy and... You don't really care, do you? Okay. Look, I'm sorry. I deserve it. But look, I didn't even talk to that girl at the bar. I didn't. That girl? What does that girl have to do with anything? (SIGHS) So, what'll it be tonight? My place or my place? -(CHUCKLES) -It's not funny, Logan. You live in a van with a dog. Okay, Denise, if it'll make you happy, I'll start looking for an apartment tomorrow. You're missing the point. Things have got to change for us. Our situation has got to change. You have got to change. Babe, I don't know where we're going. Honey, I've told you before, this is the way I am. It is hard for me to change that quick. Five years on a roller coaster is long enough. (SIGHS) Babe, what I mean is, you're a college graduate. Mmm-hmm. You have experience on the Force. You could start a whole new career if you really wanted to. What do you suggest? -You could start a security company. -(CHUCKLES) Or you can work for the DA's office. I'm being very serious. I know, honey. Look... My old man was a cop and I always wanted to be a cop. -(GROANS) Oh, here we go again. -Yes. But the Force just didn't work out for me. So, I am now doing things my own way. Now, it is not perfect out there. And the cops can't do it all. But, if I can take at least one low-life off the streets to protect people like yourself... Then I'm just doing my bit. It's the way it is. -Even if it is just for one night. -(SCOFFS) That's very noble, Logan, but what about me? I do hear you. Yeah, until the phone rings. I care about you a lot. And I'm here. And now... It's our time. You son of a bitch. Come on, man, hurry! WILSON: What you looking at me for, man? What are you calling me, jerk? What the fuck is a street hunter? Man, he bigger than you. He'll kick your ass, man. Yeah, well, his ass will be hunting for a subway tomorrow. I got his ride. Come on. Just hurry! Wilson! -Stop being so paranoid. -I'm not paranoid. Man, just come on. Put the shit on. ( CAR ALARM WAILING) (DOG GROWLING) Nice doggy. Nice motherfucker. Woof! -Shit! -(GROWLING) So, you tried to break into my van, huh? I'm sorry, Mr. Blade. I promise I won't do it again, man. I won't. I ain't no lawyer, brother. But that's breaking and entering. And unless Uncle Sam has changed the rules, that's against the law. Please, Mr. Blade. Please, man. (SIGHS) All right. It's your lucky night. I'm in a good mood. You wanna know why? -I'm with my lady. -Oh. Look at her, behind you. -Go ahead, take a look. Isn't she beautiful? -Yeah. -She's fine, ain't she? -Yes, she's fine. Tell her she's beautiful. -You're beautiful, baby! -Tell her she's fine. -You're fine! Yes, baby. -Look at me, look at me now! -What's your name? -Pretzel. -Real name. -(STAMMERS) Melvin. I live in the projects down the block. I know who you are. Pretzel, Melvin. -I know who you are. I know your grandma. -You do? Yeah, you have a sister named Diane, right? Yeah. Yeah, Diane, right. (SIGHS) Melvin, Melvin, Melvin. All right. Tell you what I'm gonna do. -I'm gonna trust you, okay? -Yeah. Now... Oh, I'm sorry. Here. Care for a beef jerky? -No. No. -Go ahead, man. -No, no. -They're good. They're good, brother. -No, my stomach isn't... I'm messed up. -Yeah, I wonder why. -All right, tell you what I'm gonna do. -What? I want you to take your friend there. Go down to the Third Precinct. And I want you to tell them that you tried to break into my van, and you want to arrest yourself. Okay? Yeah. Yeah, sure, anything, Mr. Blade. -Yeah, you law-abiding, ain't you? -Yeah! 'Cause if you don't, I know where to find you. And you'll be dinner for my dog. -Did you meet my dog by the way? -Yeah! LOGAN: Nice dog, ain't he? MELVIN: He's a nice dog. -Go ahead, pet him. -No! -You told me he's a nice dog. -Nice dog! -You both know each other, don't you? -Yeah, we go way back, Mr. Blade. -Mmm-hmm. You and I understand each other? Word. Brother, word! Yeah! You give me your word? -Mr Blade! -Hmm. You give me your word, I'll give you my word. You don't have to go down to the police station. -Thanks, Mr. Blade. -I ain't finished. -You still in school, right? -Yeah. -Senior year? -Yeah. -You planning to graduate? -Valedictorian. I'm gonna come to your graduation with your grandmother and with your sister. And I wanna see a diploma put right in this hand, right here. Is that a promise? Promise, Mr. Blade. I promise, man. -Ow! -Get outta here. Come on. Wake up. Come on, man. (STRAINS) -(GROANS) -Come on. -You better do as I say, Melvin... -Yeah. ...'cause I know where you are. I'm on the streets. Mr. Blade! You can trust me, all right? -All right. Come on. Bye! -Okay. MELVIN: You're beautiful, baby! Baby, you're beautiful! -You're beautiful, baby. -(BOTH LAUGH) DENISE: You know, babe. I think this dog is jealous of our relationship. (CHUCKLES) Just relax, Denise, okay? Okay. (PHONE RINGING) Logan, let it ring. Uh... Look, don't worry, sweetheart. I'll just tell them no. -No! -Now hang up. Logan, come down to my office immediately. Ralph? Oh, come on, buddy. Look, I'll see you in the morning, okay? Angel's escaped, and nine good cops are dead. Be right there. Denise, I gotta go. CAPTAIN RIVERA: You're right, Logan. Our guys never had a chance. They're all dead? -Jannelli, too? -Blown to bits. Fucking ambush! (SIGHS) I'm running a make on this guy Walsh. See what you can find out on the street. Yeah. You must have seen something else at the cemetery, Blade. Wellman, will you cut it? I'll call you back. Did you, Logan? Did you see anything else? Riley, I told you everything. -Oh, man, can you believe this guy? -That's enough, Wellman! Blade's on our side, remember? -If you say so, Captain. -Yeah, I say so. Now, get back to work, both of you. You realize your reward won't be paid now, right? To hell with the reward. There are nine dead cops, and Jannelli was a pal. Uh-uh. Now it's personal. I'm sorry, baby. -Had it! -Denise. I lost a friend tonight. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Listen... I have to go do a little legwork. I'll get one of the guys to bring you home, okay? Thanks, honey. We still on for tomorrow night? Yeah. Okay. WALSH: The strong shall eat the weak. The weak shall know the wrath of Caesar. You are the strong, they are the weak. The city will be ours. Tonight proves that we are invincible. I have molded you into a fighting unit. A team that thinks with one brain. My brain. As Alexander the Great led his army into the East. As Genghis Khan led his hordes across the Tundra. I will lead you to glory beyond your wildest dreams. To the wealth of 10 life times. (MEN CHANTING IN SPANISH) Right, we got a lot of work to do in the next 24 hours. So I want everybody to get some rest. And no spanking your monkeys, all right? 'Cause I know you guys. (MEN TITTERING) Dismissed! (FOOTSTEPS RETREATING) Boy, you can really talk, man. (CHUCKLES) I wish I could talk like that, I swear. You know, when this is all through, I'm gonna help you run for mayor. Come with me for a moment. What for, man, what's the matter? Oh, come on, you're not upset about those 20 kilos, are you? I can get another 100 kilos like that next time, I swear. It's not the drugs. I don't care if you're selling whores. It's not about money. If it's not about drugs, money and whores, then what the hell is it about, huh? It's about the triumph of the will. Come with me, Angel. What for? I just wanna talk with you. Just talk. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) Now, what do you think of this colonel now, huh? He's got his shit together, man. And we fucked those boys up, man! Yeah, but... You know, let me ask you something, homes. What the fuck is he talking about? Half the time, I don't know what the fuck he's talking about. Yo, I don't know and I don't care. I got more money than I ever did in my life. We do what the man says. We have more money, cars and women. (CHUCKLES) (SNIFFS) Women, man. I tell you, when this is all over, I'm gonna buy me a fucking island in the Caribbean. Maybe I buy my own island, too. Someplace nice like Switzerland. Conyo, man. That's a nice fucking island. Lot of women there, too. You know, I like it when women play it rough. You know, put up a fight. I show them who the fuck a man is. What, you got a personal problem or something, man? -You talk to me if you... -I told you not to touch me. I'm sorry, man. I forgot, all right? You wasted time at the cemetery. You wasted time when I freed you. That is not what I taught you. That is not professional. You must be alert 25 hours a day. Caesar kept sentries on around-the-clock vigils against the barbarians of Gaul. (STUTTERS) I don't know no Caesar, man. I must trust you to follow my orders, like Philotas followed Alexander the Great. I don't know them guys either, man. I will control the city with you, or without you. You waste my time again... I waste you. -Comprende? -Yeah, man. We'll do it together. I'm pleased we could share this moment together. LOGAN: Hey, partner. -What's going on, man? -How you doing, Jamie? -Yeah, I'm doing all right, you know. -Getting any? Well, for a man of my age and stature, I ain't doing bad. (CHUCKLES) Hey, how's that little woman of yours? Eh, she's still mad at me, man. I'm driving her crazy doing this bounty hunter stuff. -Hey, you gotta take care of business, you know? -Yeah, I hear you. -Hey, listen, man. -Hmm? I don't know about you, but this city is falling apart, man. Mmm-hmm. I got stuck up six times last year. I used to carry a baseball bat. -You know, just to protect myself. -I hear you. -Now, I gotta carry this. -(SIGHS) You got a permit for that, partner? Well, I got... Well, not exactly a permit. But, you know, with the violence the way it is and the drugs, man, -this city is coming apart at the seams. -Yeah. If it gets any worse, I'm gonna need a bazooka and a yellow tank. (CHUCKLES) You know, like that thing that happened last night. -Yeah. -It's all over the papers. And that's exactly what I came here to talk to you about. -Looking for cop killers, huh? -Yeah. Jamie, if there is anything that you know, man. Tell me. -Look, this is strictly between you and me. -You got it. Eddie's seen the whole thing. He ain't going to the cops neither. Hmm. The crazy boy, huh? Well, he's gonna be my next stop. Thank you, Jamie. (CHUCKLES) -(WOMAN GIGGLES) -Whoa! (LAUGHS) (ALL LAUGHING) Whoo! Oh, look! Look! (LAUGHS) Who the fuck? Oh, shit! Blade! (CHUCKLES) You gave me 10 heart attacks, man. Why the hell didn't you ring the bell, dude? I did, dude, for 10 minutes. Of course, with these two exquisite young ladies... -How are you today, girls? -We are great. LOGAN: You look great. I really can't blame you for not answering the door. Hey, this is breaking and entering, man. What is this shit? Well, you go ahead and make a citizen's arrest, crazy boy. I'd like to stick around and wait for the cops, amongst all this discount merchandise that you sell. Hey, wait a minute. Chill. Chill. I'm just a small businessman trying to make a living the American way. -Yeah. -You know what I mean? Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. Would you ladies excuse us for a couple of minutes? Why don't you stay and play? Yeah, there's plenty of room for all of us. You know, boy-girl, boy-girl. (CHUCKLES) Shit, man. I finally get a chance to do some tingling with my ladies, you come in and cramp my style, man. (CHUCKLES) Yeah, well. A minute with me or five years with The Man. You call it. Brother! (SIGHS) Keep the bed warm, ladies. (CHUCKLES) Man talk. Here. What about that CD you promised us? -The microwave. -And the movie role. Yeah, what about the movie role? Maybe we'll talk... Talk about it later, all right? We'll talk about it later, hmm? Next bus to Hoboken. -Movie role, huh? -(CHUCKLES) -Hey, man, what the... -Now, you listen, you little weasel. I could bust you with just one phone call. One phone call. So don't break my balls. Now, I want the truth. What did you see last night? Okay, but only for you 'cause you're cool. Cut the crap. Talk. These dudes were tight. They was jamming. Look like something out of some John Wayne movie. You know, Iwo Jima and shit. Diablos? It could have been Martians for all I know. They were wearing gas masks. Angel's dudes, they got their thing together. Anything else? No, no more. I don't know nothing. -Where's the phone? -Wait! (SIGHS) This is heavy. You gonna back me up? Try me. Word on the street is Angel is backed by the Columbians. Big boys, Blade. Big boys. You sure about this? It's the truth. Oh, boy. Don't sit. Why you sit? Who told you to sit? I came to collect, Benny. You owe me. Yeah, I owe you. I know I owe you. Every time I look up, you're in my fucking face. What, huh? What? I need to talk to Don Mario. The Don? Huh, just like that. (LAUGHS) (WHEEZES) (COUGHS) Do you know what happened last night? This is a big fucking favor you're asking me. Benny... I kept you out of lockup. You owe me. Okay, I'll get you an audience with the Don. (CLICKS TONGUE) Anything else? -Nope. -Then we're even. This is it. This is the end of it, right? I don't gotta look up and see you spoiling my meal anymore, right? Huh? Huh, Blade? We're even, right? Huh? -Yup. -Then get the fuck out of here. Ciao. Where's my pastina? Bring me my fucking pastina. And put some anchovies on this goddamn salad, would you? A world anchovy shortage or something? (TELEPHONE RINGING) Yeah, what is it? MAN ON PHONE: Romano meets with the other dons tonight at his coffin factory. How convenient. There's something else. I'm listening. It's Blade, I'm worried about him. You're a cop. You're supposed to be our pipeline, take care of business. He could find out about my involvement with you. They call him the Street Hunter. He didn't make up that name himself. You fight a weapon with a weapon. Terminate him. (GREETING IN SPANISH) You know better than smoking in my quarters. Oh, sorry about that, man, I forgot. Study, study, study, huh? That's great, man, you're always studying. I wish I could be like that. Strategy plus mind always equals victory. Well, it sounds like you got a plan, huh? The Greeks fought the Trojans in a 10-year war, and won on a simple, ingenious device, the Trojan horse. A horse? Who needs horses, man? I don't know nothing about horses, man, my boys don't know about horses, man. -We're from the streets. -Let me explain. The rolled the Trojan horse into the walls of Troy, sprang from its belly, and slaughtered all the Trojans. That's what we're gonna do tonight to the Romanos. Great, man. That's great. 'Cause I don't care if I have to pop out of the fucking belly of a pig, as long as they're all dead. Listen to me. And follow orders. Blade, get your fucking hands up. -Check them out. -Wider. Come on. What you got? Anything under there? Ooh, that feels good. I'll just stick my fucking gun in your mouth, let me know how good that's gonna feel, Blade. That's some fucking mouth on you today, Blade. Don't be fucking cute. What are you, a comedian today? -Is he good? -Yeah, he's clean. Put your hands down before I stick them up your fucking ass. Shut your fucking mouth. Mr. Romano. You got 30 seconds, Blade. I'd like to find your son's killers. I take care of my own problems. What do I need with you? You're a businessman. Blood is bad for business, right? Right. Well, I can find them quicker and cleaner than your soldiers. -Is that right? -Mmm-hmm. And what's in it for you? One of them has a price on his head, and I want him. You want him? He was my kid and my blood. And you want revenge? What are we, fucking related? I know we ain't cousins, 'cause you're dressed funny. What's really on your mind, pal? I mean, why should I give him to you? What's in it for me? No unnecessary blood will be spilled, sir. What are you, a fucking Good Samaritan? Mr. Romano, in your business you don't kill cops. These animals do. Let me find them. I'll tell you what I'm gonna let you do. I'm gonna let you get the fuck out of my face and stay out of my business. 'Cause I'm gonna personally rip their hearts out. Time's up. Come on. RADIO COMMENTATOR: ...making it one of the bloodiest nights in the city's history. Expressing outrage at last night's ambush and massacre of nine New York City police officers, the mayor has offered a $100,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of the assassins. In a related incident, Louis Romano, son of reputed mob boss, -Mario Romano... -(PHONE RINGING) -...was gunned down at a gang shootout at... -(TURNS OFF RADIO) Blade. Word's out you wanna know about Angel and the Diablos. Meet me in an hour and I could have something for you. If you pay good. I'm not interested in old news. Hey, hey, I'm cool. I got what you want. But I can't have none of the Diablos see me talking to you. I'm an indio. So let meet at... I'll say where we meet. The abandoned theater at 13th and Third. Enter through the alley, in 15 minutes. Not bad. Not great. I don't see a future in it for you or nothing. You know what my father used to say? We only get one chance in our lifetime. We only get just one chance, man, and this is your chance. You wanna prove that you can stand with us? You wanna be a Diablo? Yeah, that's what I want. -I wanna be a Diablo. -All right, man, then you show us. What you gotta do, is keep Blade occupied, right? You don't flinch, you don't move, you just stand. Armando here will take care of the rest, all right? -Do you wanna be a Diablo? -Yeah. All right, man, you're gonna be a Diablo, all right? Yeah, all right. Over here. You're late. I, uh, I had to be careful. I'm indio, remember? You're a scared punk. Now, business. What do you want to know? You called me. Well, uh, Angel and those Diablos, they're behind the killings. Already know that. Where? -Where, what? -Goodbye. Wait, wait. All right, man. If I, uh, if I tell you where they're at, you promise not to let out who told you, right? Talk now or I leave. (SNARLING) Now you wanna talk? (SNARLING) Now it's my turn. (BOTH GRUNTING) (COUGHING) (GROWLING) I'm telling you nada, man. I'm Diablo. Hector, Hector, you're indio. The Diablos used you. They would have offed Blade and you. No way. And even if it is true, I still ain't telling you nothing. You can't hold me. You got no charges against me. Well, I guess, we could take him down to the basement, huh, Captain? Yeah, Captain. Let us play 20 Questions with this slimeball. Goodman. Get this crybaby out of here. No crybaby, I'm gonna be a Diablo. A man! Not a sellout white boy like you. Don't you talk to me like that, motherfucker. My name is, Ralph Motherfucking Rivera, you hear me? Ralph Motherfucking Rivera, Captain Motherfucking Rivera. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Motherfucker! Get this motherfucker out of here! Okay, let's go. (SIGHS) Well, we're back to square one. I got this crazy commando killing my cops. Innocent people are gonna get caught in the crossfire. -How can I help, Ralph? -We don't need your help. (SIGHS) -Chill out, detective. -(SARCASTICALLY) Yes, sir. Here's the dossier on Walsh. This guy is a real piece of work. He was the best and the brightest. Honors at school. Distinguished service in 'Nam, a lot of top secret assignments, and then he starts to get a little warped. Why the dishonorable discharge? Well, he punches out two US senators visiting an army base near Saigon. It wasn't political though. One was a Democrat and one was a Republican. (LAUGHS) He managed to be out of 'Nam before the trial, shows up in Angola next. He left the US army as a captain, right? But some African dictator makes him a colonel. Trains the locals, does a few missions, then onto the next war. Does the same thing in El Salvador, does the same thing in Lebanon. Now he's here. Well, we'll get him, all right. Yeah, first we gotta find him. Whenever we get close to him, he packs up the Diablos pronto and they move to a new hideout. -Like an army on the move? -Exactly. Well, the word out on the street said Angel is part of the Columbian cartel. He's their man in New York. -And something very heavy is about to happen. -What's that? I don't know yet, but I will find out. I'll be at Denise's, if you need to reach me. -Yeah, take care, buddy. -Yeah. Smile. I hate this fucking guy. I'm gonna nail his ass. You will, don't worry, you will. Everything in its own time. -I'm gonna follow him. -Hey, come on. Whoa! Look at you, you look like shit. Go home, take a shower, take a bath. Get some sleep, I'm gonna do the same. Come on. It's been a bitch of a day. Yeah, you're right. -See you in the morning, partner. -Oh, hey. (LAUGHING) -Don't be a wise ass. -Can't help it. Yeah, hello, operator, yeah. I'd like to make a credit card call. Yeah, the number is, uh, 212-555-96942341. 2341. Right. This is a call to Medellin, Columbia. And the number is, 555-483. Okay? Thanks a lot. (SPEAKING SPANISH) -Get the car. -Go get the car. Pull it up. -Did you call the florist? -Well... We ain't got all day, you know. (MUSIC PLAYING OVER STEREO) (STARTS ENGINE) Get our people out there. Find those Diablos and burn them! I'm proud of you all, my soldiers. Each day we grow another head like the Hydra. And each head makes us stronger. (CHOKING) Soon, we'll be the ultimate victors. The ultimate masters. Unconquered, unvanquished. We are the future! We can share the thunder! It's Year One. Long live the new order! (DENISE HUMMING) (LATCH CLICKS) Logan? (TURNS ON SHOWER) (SHOWER RUNNING) (GRUNTING) Wow! Mmm. So you like to play rough, huh? Tell me something, where's your boyfriend? Hmm? Hmm? Oh, you're gonna be so sorry he's not here. (GRUNTS) Bitch! No. First, I'm gonna teach you some manners. Come on. Kick me again. I like that. Come on. Come on. The nigger! (GRUNTING) (GROANS) Ahh! I wouldn't do that if I were you. I'm sorry, baby. -Everything all right? -Right on time, brother. (SIGHS) You know, Blade, this has been a long time coming. Yeah. -Where's Wellman? -Wellman, who's he? He's another dumb shit cop who puts his ass on the line every day for a pension to spend when he's too old to be banging hookers on the back seat -of his squad car. -(BOTH CHUCKLE) You know, Blade, you'd still be on the force today, if it wasn't for me. Get his gun. You're the son of bitch who framed me? I was making top dollar working for Don Romano. -Dirty dollars. -Dirty, clean, what's the difference? I had a fistful. But you, you were the cop in shining fucking armor. You got the glory, the fame. Me, your ex-partner, I got bullshit. You're not the only one who knows how to take care of business, Mr. Blade. You got too close to me, I had to stop you. But you belong to me now. -And Romano? -Who needs him? His homeboys are the new winners. Winners? These three boneheads couldn't even stop Denise. Oh, yes. That brings us to Denise, doesn't it? You know, you're much to fine for that motherfucker, baby. Adios, brother. Riley, you talk too much. Ah! Logan! Ahh! DENISE: (SCREAMING) No! Let go! Damn it! Leave me alone! -No! -Come on, move! -Shut up, bitch! -Hold it, Riley! Let me out of here. Hey! Thank you very much. (TIRES SCREECHING) Logan Blade, bad man. Come on, Logan. "That's it. My, my, my," said the spider to the Blade. "Come on in, and catch this shade, huh?" Come on, Logan Blade, Street Hunter, hunt this. Come on, let's go. Come on, I got you doing it right here. Come on. (BEEPING) Ahh! RILEY: Goddamn you! Get in here. Goddamn, Blade, I should've killed you a long time ago. (GROANS) You talk too much. LOGAN: Denise. It's okay now, baby. Stay, Munch. Yes, Mr. Blade. It's okay now. I've got her. Congratulations, you're a worthy adversary. I appreciate that. I wanted to meet you. But now... Now the hunt's over. WALSH: Shoot the mutt. Sorry, jefe. Remember, men, in the field, you can't afford to miss. Here we are, Logan, huh? It's you, me, my boys, your girl. We're all here, man, come on. Why don't you just take me? Come on, man, take me. Come on, why don't you fucking take me, right? You've been chasing me for a whole fucking month! Come on, what is it? 'Cause you're not with your dog, man, is that it? You're not with your dog? Or you're afraid we're gonna hurt your girl? Is that what it is? We're not gonna hurt her, man. We're gonna be nice and gentle with her. (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS) Come on. So you, so you coming or what? (LAUGHS) Come on, man, you're coming or what? (EXHALES) (SIGHS) Denise. Honey? Walsh... Let her go. Your concern for this woman surprises me, buddy. She's been your downfall. Achilles heel. Perhaps you've forgotten you're a soldier, a warrior like me. Oh, man, I'm nothing like you. You're wrong. We're brothers. -The difference is you have no respect for law and order. -You're wrong again. I respect the law. The law I create, administer and judge. It's the only way, Blade. Order doesn't work. That's why I created my own here, because order is only as good as those who control it. Look what happened in 'Nam. No, man, don't start that, I was there. I know. I did my homework. You know they didn't let us win. I also think there was a little bit more to it than that. No, man. They fucked it up. They didn't let us win. Glory was denied us. And now, now there's no more wars. Nothing to fight for anymore. You know that, Blade. There's nothing to fight for but the fight itself. Only in war can you find your soul. Walsh. Is that what all this is about for you? Hmm? It's about the consequences of strength. I am strong. Yo, man, you, uh, may be strong with those two goons behind you, and, uh, may be strong with a fistful of lead in your hands. How strong would you be one-on-one? Mano-a-mano, huh? Mano-a-mano, you know what I mean? Tempting challenge, buddy. And one I'll take you up on our next briefing. Perhaps after we explore that challenge, you'll want to join with me. Perhaps I can change your mind about the state of things. I might take you up on that preposition. If, uh, you just let Denise go free, okay? -Huh? -(LAUGHS) I need more of a commitment than your word to let her go. This woman means nothing to me. Angel wants her. If he does his job in tonight's operation, I'll give her to him. The spoils of war. (KNOCK ON DOOR) Come in. All set, jefe. I did everything that you said. Good job, Angel. I've enjoyed talking with you, Blade. So I won't kill you. You're not gonna waste him now? Oh, man, I'll take care of him. -I'll take care of him in a heartbeat. -No. I want him alive. He's the only one here who knows what the hell I'm talking about. I should finish you off right now, fucking Logan. You want to finish me off? Go ahead. Finish me off. 'Cause if you do, you funny-looking little midget, your fruitcake leader over there will slice your throat from ear to ear. He said that shit? That's all right, 'cause I'm not going to need him after tonight. 'Cause I'm sick and fucking tired of him talking about the fucking past. 'Cause I don't care about the past, man, I care about today and tomorrow, man. He thinks I'm fucking stupid, we're gonna see who the fuck is stupid. And dago, you are stupid. (SNAPS FINGERS) I got just the right thing for you, man. When I go to the Romanos tonight, I'm gonna get a fucking pine box for you, that's what I'm gonna do. -(CHUCKLES) -You like that? Keep dreaming. I got big plans for your bitch, too. -That's right, baby. -Angel. Angel, get off her. Get off her! (GROWLS) Baby. -That's right. -Hey. -Hey. -(WHISPERS) Baby, yeah. Angel! (GROWLS) Yeah, baby. Mmm. -Angel, stop it, man. -(LAUGHS) I'm gonna let you watch, man, before I bury you alive, too. Get off her, man. Hey! Hey! I'll see you later, man. Hasta luego. We'll be talking. Baby. -It's all right, all right, all right. -(SOBS) I know, I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Tonight is what we've been training for. Our show of strength, -our show of force. -(GUN CLICKS) I told you I'd take you to glory, like Alexander the Great at Arbela. -Don't disappoint me. -(COCKS GUN) (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) (MEN CHANTING IN SPANISH) I don't know what these dons are talking about. I don't understand this either. They should send me to take care of these guys. You? Just you? You're gonna walk in and take care of the Diablos by yourself? -That's right, just me. -I'm with Vin. We don't operate that way. We don't operate on our own. I'm gonna send your widow flowers, how's that pal? (CHUCKLES) (BOTH SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Thanks. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Don Mario. Allow us to express our condolences for the untimely passing of your son, huh? -Thank you, thank you very much. -Two losses in one year. Tsk, tsk, what a shame. First your father, and now your son. Thank you, thank you, my friend. (THANKING IN ITALIAN) Gentlemen, I appreciate your fine sentiments. And I, uh, appreciate your loyalty throughout the years. Both for my father and now for myself. But... -People live and people die. -Hmm. Especially in our business. Oh! (GROANS) (WHIMPERS) (GROANS) And now, I'm gonna have a little fun with your lady, yeah? Don't touch her! LOGAN: You hear me? Leave her alone! Leave her alone! (MUFFLED SHOUT) Surprise. Now... Cut the ropes. (KNIFE CLICKS) Don't be stupid. Attaboy. Good, now drop the knife. -(THUDS) -Hello. (GUNSHOT) Denise, baby, it's okay. Son of a bitch! We could've been killed, Logan. -All right, Denise. I'm really sorry. -Sorry? (SHOUTS) You're sorry? Honey, honey. Just stay here, okay? -I'll call Daze. -I can take care of myself. I got to go stop them, don't you know that? Baby, look, I promise, when this is over, we'll work this out later. I promise you. Here, now... Hold onto this and wait until Daze comes, you'll be safe. Okay? -Denise. -This is it, Logan. I'm sorry, baby. I'm really sorry. So am I. Damn it. (SOBS) Shit! Yeah, well, looks like it's just you and me, partner. Just you and me. (SIGHS) LOGAN: Daze. Logan. Do me a favor, brother. Pick up Denise at the abandoned church on Garnett Street. Can't explain now, but... Looks like I really messed up with the lady this time. Thanks. Why don't we go get some calamari? -Who's buying? -You're buying. All right, let's go. Come on. Whoa, whoa. Nobody's going nowhere. You got a job to do, you're staying right here. They're up there talking. We stay right here and do our job. Nobody goes nowhere. Gentlemen, I called you together this evening to discuss a serious problem. A problem that not only concerns our business, but it concerns our country. The name of the problem is Diablos. These fucking foreigners. They come to our country... They come to our country and muscle in on us. Instead of staying in the fucking jungle and taking care of the supply line, they come here and try to muscle in on us. Well, it's got to a point where we got two choices, we either buy them out or we blow them away. Give me a light, Ronnie. Surgeon General says smoking is bad for your health. Who the fuck is this guy? Who is this fucking crazy bastard? (GUNFIRE) Regroup! My soldiers, the day is ours. Alexander of Macedonia took 50,000 infantry and horsemen against King Darius' 250,000 Persians, Parthians, Bedouins and Capadocians. Alexander broke through the line against overwhelming odds and won the Battle of Arbela. Today we have won the battle of New York. The day is ours! (CLAPPING) So, Angel... You coming or what? Now is the time. (GUNS COCKING) I want him alive! Argh! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) Ahhh! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (YELLS) (YELLS) Argh! I got a bad feeling about this, man. My mother called me up today, she told me... (MACHINE WHIRRING) He's good. (GUNSHOTS) He's very good. (POLICE SIRENS BLARING) They're here, man, the blue balls are here, man. I, I told you I had a bad feeling about this, man. Let's get the fuck out of here, come on. Let's book, man. I think we should split up. What do you think, Colonel? I won't stand for insubordination. Whatever you say, man, you're the colonel. So where are we gonna to go from here? Valhalla. We'll be at the hideout. You hear that, Blade? I'll be there. So, Angel... You're coming or what? I've had it with you, man. I'm gonna blow you away for good this time, man. You just won't learn, will you, Angel? I told you I want him alive. Too bad we couldn't be on the same team, Blade. I could've made you rich, you could've made me more powerful. Yeah, well... It looks to me like you made everybody dead. Hey, man, I didn't make everybody dead. I took care of business. They weren't able to do their job. They weren't able to follow orders. (GROWLING) (SNARLING) Tonight I called you a worthy adversary. (GUN DROPS) Prove me right. Choose your weapon. Mano-a-mano. That's my favorite form of combat. Ready? (GRUNTS) Ahhh! (GROANS) (STRAINS) You're crazy, man. -You think I'm crazy, Blade? -Yeah. They thought Napoleon was crazy, too. (LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY) (GRUNTS) (STRUGGLES) You're Benedict Arnold, Blade. You know about Benedict Arnold? The books call him a traitor. But he was the greatest military general in the Revolutionary War. It's true, Blade. I know. That's my favorite war. (STRAINS) (CACKLES) Benedict Arnold was maligned, man. He won battles, man. Ticonderoga, Valcour Island, Saratoga, Saratoga, Blade! (GRUNTS) Ahhh! Ahh! (YELLS) (GROANS) (PANTS) (FOOTSTEPS CLIMBING STAIRS) Come on, Blade, let's finish it. I was just having fun. I'm very upset with you, Blade. If you won't finish it, you leave me no choice! Last chance, Blade! (GUN CLICKS) I'm still here, Blade. Let's end it, Walsh. We should've been friends, Blade. WALSH: I'm gonna miss you. (CLICKS) Ahhh! (CRASHING) (THUDS) Can't say the same about you. (DOG GROWLING) (SNARLING) Ahh! ANGEL: (COUGHS) My nose, man. You broke my nose. Good. That way you won't put anymore nose candy up there. Hey, I used to be so good-looking, man, and you had to bust my nose. Look, I'm tired, my lady is very pissed at me, it's because I've been chasing your skinny little ass. I don't care, man. You busted my nose. (BONE CRUNCHING) (GROANS) Now it's fixed. -It's cold-blooded, man. -Yeah. You might as well kill me, man, 'cause I'm not gonna go back. Oh, no, no. That's too easy. Besides, I'd rather see you get put away for life without parole. So that way, you can rot till you die. (CHUCKLES) Get in there. (SIGHS) Good boy. You know, you skinny little monkey, the more people I meet, the more I like my dog. I'll get you, man. I'm gonna kill you, Logan. I'm gonna... Shut up. Let's go, Munch.
