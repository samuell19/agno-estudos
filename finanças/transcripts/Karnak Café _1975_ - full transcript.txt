I'm not embarrassed I'll advertise my poverty on TV I'm poor everyone I'm poor, people Don't make a scandal He's right... it's like a riddle To succeed you must study, so you need books, which cost money Heaps of money A book to explain the Charter costs 2 pounds. The Charter, 2 piasters So to understand socialism, your dad must be a capitalist How smart; it's good of them to even offer such a service - Oh, yeah? - Ismail's right. Listen, Helmy... Just give me a pen Wait Poor... three times over Work hard. God be with you - Let's walk home - Again? - Won't you come to Karnak? -Yes What's with this Karnak these days? - Since when do you go to cafes? - It's not just a cafe What then? A café-au-lait?! No, an espresso; ask Helmy - We attend Taha El-Gharib's seminar - The author? - At a café with the likes of you? - We're not nobodies You're not, but I'm coming with you Fine, come with us Ahly... Ahly Me sitting at a café? You'll love it. She's white and pretty with long lashes - Who? - The Karnak, boy. The Karnak I break my bones beneath the shadow of sorrow and pain I beat the walls again and again My hands shake like a leaf on a tree The wall stands firm like destiny Beyond the wall is my bliss, mute Beyond the wall I'm lonely, destitute Our white house with green window sill No, no... in that place don't dwell For like you I want to be For like her I cannot be - Hello, Mr. Helmy - How are you Lady Qurunfela?

Am I, then, insane? That's it; it's finished The poem's finished What do you think, Mr Taha? - Forgive me, but why write it? - To express myself To whom? People? Your words are too hard to grasp Sorry But they're metaphors, Mr Taha You yourself use metaphors in your writings I don't use metaphors People read and interpret as they like Please, Mr Taha. I have a response to your words - We've not been introduced yet - Zeinab Diab - Our colleague in Medical School - Hello This is Rashad Magdy, a pensioner - And Mohammed Bahgat, undersecretary - "Ex", if you please Go ahead. At your service You've never criticized politics outright I always feel you're beating about the bush That's the nature of art... indirect That's how it differs from journalism Articles say nothing nowadays Ages ago, articles toppled ministers Freedom, strong parties Parties commercialized slogans for personal purposes Pardon them; it's what they learn in Youth Organization Not the organization... it's reality Would parties have been able to form a strong army? The High Dam? Free education? Manufacturing? Agricultural reform? Those are successful projects of the Revolution But the real revolutionists should be in control Not the bourgeois that prospered in the King's days The Sheik Taha lesson will go on forever If you don't like it, block your ears - No, no - Calm down Freedom is the ability to say no. If one can't say no... - he'd die - God forbid. Rather your enemies Why upset him, guys? Sit down God bless you Liberty means responsibility. Since I chose to be free I am responsible for my choice That's what they call commitment Commitment and liberty are inseparable Qurunfela was queen of belly dancing in the past - That's apparent - Know now why Helmy loves seminars? Those are foreign ideas; you got them from Sartre Right! Sartre, a French philosopher of 5 letters Now, an Arab country of 4 letters, starting with M ending in R - Qatar? Mother? - Magar? (Hungary) Mother and Magar indeed! Let's go. Misr (Egypt), man Misr, Hajj Wait a minute - Spell it. "S" or "C"? -"S" for soup The Egyptian renaissance emerged from the café where Gamal Eddin El-Afghani went But at Taha El-Gharib's café, most attack the renaissance and revolution - Haven't you noticed? -Yes Yes, indeed! Speak your mind The elderly are backward by nature. Let me write Are youth backward too? They all profited by the revolution If not for free education, they'd be unable to philosophize What do you think? Let me copy this... or copy it yourself - You've eaten up all the pickles? -Yes - What horrible handwriting -I'm in a hurry What for? So we can return the book to Helmy Plus I was leaning on my knee. If only I had a desk! You're a bourgeois, anxious to climb the social ladder Me? Why? Hadn't we agreed to serve people in the countryside? - Or do you want a doctor's 5 C's? - What 5 C's? Clinic, Car, Construction building, Country estate and Civilized bride I want one C The Cute daughter of Diab as bride Where's our home? - Whenever we get here you ask that -Yes There it is.

Congrats - You're as stupid as your mom - You're the dunce Watch your tongue, or I'll cut it off Isn't it better than your wandering from house to house? Tell him. You should go to the government for help - A sewing machine, say? - No, a cigarette kiosk - And quit my trade? - Your trade? You're no doctor... get what you can from the government - Why do we have dates? - Ismail's mother sent it Her son Moneim's arrived from Aswan Really? I'll go say hi Indeed?! No kidding?! - And get my notebook from Ismail - May his mother choke - Why? They're kind people - He's brainwashed you Wake up! Poor people aren't suited Women are such wise creatures! I'll be on my way Bye. God be with you Poor people aren't suited, nay The marriage clerk's fee I won't pay Why didn't you tell us you were coming?

Welcome back, Moneim - Thanks, Zeinab Here's your notebook Tomorrow at the bus station. Early - Tea for our sweet doctor - Maybe next time - Good night - Good night Early All of this fabric? So many posters? - Who'll read this in Mit Na'oura? - Peasants, naturally When we teach them to read first As long as they are sick, poor and naked they'll never learn We're in for a fabric shortage in the land Why don't we make clothes for peasants instead? - Good idea - Here are the scissors What's going on? We have a suggestion Instead of writing on the material, let's give it to peasants - They're sure to benefit more - What? I mean they have no practical use for posters As you know, there's a shortage of... - It's none of your business - How come?

They're all carbon copies of each other - Why else didn't I join the Institution? - Why? - Because it's all about posters - Don't be too harsh - Does nothing please you? - Softening, are we? My country, though it's unfair to me is precious My nation, though they hurt me are generous Sit down, Sisi - Who'd believe rice is 5 pt a kilo? - It's the Yemen war It caused everything to go up It's a revolution against regression. We're helping - Uproot our regression first - It's politics, fellows - Egypt has a great many responsibilities - So we squander our money? Truly, Egypt gifts to others drift We deprive ourselves of necessary food... to give out aid to countries perhaps richer than we What does the revolution generation think? - What do you think, Ismail? - They say give Caesar his due Evening, gentlemen - Hasaballah? - Evening, Chief Diab Welcome, Chief Hasaballah Greetings, fellows Khaisha, fetch him a special pumpkin Never mind that.

She's a doctor! - I make lots of money How much will she make as a doctor? Her salary hardly reaches the price of twenty chickens - That's what you want to tell me? -Yes and I'm in a hurry I swear you're braying like a mule I spend all this money on her then give her to you?

You know my handwriting is awful I taught you to write and you passed with flying colors Please, let me dictate you Here's a paper and pen What's this? The homework notebook? - You'll write of dancing in it? - Dancing is my homework - A social or patriotic duty? - If you'll mock me, forget it No, I'm sorry - How old when you first danced? - I was nine They made me a small dancing costume to measure None of the spectators could imagine I'd alter exotic dancing Before I appeared dancing was about shaking the belly and breasts I made it an art I learnt from the opera and Pergola and Auberge concerts Do you know what I'd like, Helmy? I want to go out with you I want to walk and see the shop windows with you, go to a movie Or we could go to the theater. Would you be ashamed of me?

Brotherhood? I was never in the Brotherhood Why grow your beard then? It grew here At least you're free of shaving Imagine, for 20 years in the service, I shave it early each day Go on, Adel Ismail, last Thursday, you were with 2 people who gathered donations for jailed Brothers Why? No, he was a colleague gathering donations to build a mosque Since one is your friend, he must have convinced you to join them I never joined them And he's not a friend, just a colleague - Do you know him or don't you? - Yes, I do, but... but... But what? Speak, Ismail; we're like brothers Never mind Continue, Adel - What do you know of the group? - I know nothing of that group Stop beating about the bush. Speak, don't get me cross - But, sir, I'm not... - Have a cigarette We're just chatting; this is all routine - Thanks - I'm sure you're innocent Be seated, miss Please, tell me. I can find no one to talk to. I've been here... I don't know how long I've been here Please be seated Here you go You know, I envy your generation In our day, there was no such thing as love Take me, for instance... I married then fell in love with my wife The loveliest thing on earth is love, right? It's a waste to spend it on trivialities If you love Ismail, advise him to abandon politics - When did he join the Brotherhood? - Ismail? - We know you're both Muslim Brothers - That's not true What is true? - We are not Brothers or anything - Then what are you?

Are all who talk religion criminals? Many criminals talk religion I believe in the Revolution I was five when it arose I consider myself its disciple I'd never think of an anti-patriotic activity Why did you join the Brothers then? - Sir, I don't even pray - We don't care if you pray We care about the poisoned thoughts you instill in your colleagues Those thoughts create chaos in the Youth Organization Who organized the meetings you attended? - I attended no meetings - It's no use denying Ismail, you will talk Neither I nor Ismail have anything to do with those things What do you think of the Revolution? Ismail and I profited by the Revolution and believe in it That's the excuse of 99% of the Revolution's enemies The Brothers and the Wafd party and the Communists Zeinab, you can help us & Ismail How? - Tell us all you know - I told you all I know In that case, we'll keep Ismail pending a full investigation You are free to go home now - Adel, handle release procedures - Go home? Your stay here is ended. Goodbye Please, sir, I've done nothing - What's wrong? - I've done nothing.

Allow me - Thanks Good thing you're innocent We ought to hand out booze, I mean sodas today Um Zeinab, Um Zeinab Aren't you proven innocent? - Zeinab's safely returned - We thought so Welcome back, dear - Where's Ismail? - He's fine. He'll be out soon Good gracious me! They still have him? - Zeinab - I wonder how you are, Ismail - I missed you - I have none but you It seems the vice squad had captured them - Were they cheating in weights? - No She had a high visiting fee It's all because of Ismail, Baheya's son - Stop it, your tears are useless - Are we the jail type, Diab? They wrongly arrested us, mom And when they learned of our innocence they released us Tell us what happened, Zeinab, so your mother can be at ease - Because of politics - Good girl. Did you hit the British? - What British? - It's why one's arrested in politics Politics? Are we into politics? Why's politics our business? Do you want to be a minister? - What an ignorant woman! - Damn education and the educated Ignorant woman! - Did they beat you? - No - Didn't they torture you at all? - No - What's jail like? - What do you think? - Did they feed you? -Yes They brought us plump kids like you to devour - What was the prosecutor's charge? - There was no prosecutor - How could they arrest you? - I don't know How can this happen in a country that calls for justice & freedom? - Were you locked in a cell? - No, in an office - So did they treat you well? - Yes, but you must try for yourself - Miss Zeinab -Yes? I'd like to invite you to attend a seminar of "Divine Guidance" group on the topic of medicine and the Quran Listen... get off my case, man - We have orders to release you - Thanks, sir. God bless you - But we were treated as if guilty - Can't stand a couple of days? If you'd believed us to start with A mistake is pardonable, but not negligence in duty You wouldn't have pardoned us - Right? -Yes These were security procedures to protect the Revolution I trust we treated you properly Right, sir. God keep all evil from you We missed many lectures. We must start to study hard I never imagined I could be so humiliated and insulted Don't look back We'll soon forget all Forget, how? I was going to go mad when I learnt you were captured, too I wanted to break the walls to reach you When I got out and found myself all alone without you I couldn't bear the world I could well have asked them to take me again - I love you - I missed you, Ismail That's it... I've forgotten everything No, I still remember some of it; make me forget Behave yourself or I'll make you forget your name - Won't we go to Helmy? - Let's stay - He's waiting to go to Karnak - Karnak again? Didn't we agree to work hard to catch up? We've had enough done to, and said of, us I don't care about gossip; the trouble's with your mom - I sense her changed treatment - But dad's with you all the way Alright, Somaa? Will you obey Zanuba? But I can't abandon my friends. They got jailed because of me Want me to be chicken? - Mr. Helmy - Helmy Helmy Welcome back. How are you, Mr. Helmy? Welcome, Mr Ismail - Long live justice - Welcome back, Mr. Helmy Good thing you've come. We can't enjoy ourselves without you Tell me, 3 words... A three-letter word Take a seat, man.

Huh? - At Liberty Café - Did you enjoy yourself? May you enjoy yourself like they did, Zein Same headlines and numbers The 3 newspapers hardly differ They ought to call them leaflets That's totally wrong The 3 newspapers aren't the same The crosswords in El-Gomhoreya are far better - God bless you - Tell me, though... where are the rest of you? God alone knows... El-Sisi seems to have retired at his peak - Imam -Yes come and see what the brothers... - I mean what the guys will drink - No, drinks are my treat today No, my treat. And you're all invited to dinner at my place but each at his own expense Each of you hand me 7 pounds, 45 piasters Skip Ismail. Zeinab, hand it over - Please... a relative? - Ibrahim, my cousin Beer Ismail, go get beer Not me... God damns its drinker and its bearer Haven't you given up? Go, or they'll re-arrest you God forbid! Go, Ismail, get the beer. You're the beer; I'm the glass Come by me... come by me - God give you pleasure - Thanks I'm mad at you, Zeinab. Why didn't you come to me when you got out? - Do you love him a lot? - Helmy? He's my love, my brother and my son Don't pretend to be old What comforts me is he loves me as he needs tenderness Did you love him first or did he? Maybe he did, but I love him more We want to eat.. we want to eat The kids are ravenous - The ration - Don't remind us So we're ex-cons now You know, I want to get jailed too. It's so original As long as we're in a single cell No, me and Ismail What? Think I'll let you? - Seems you're not modern at all - Not at all Suppression is the source of all our regression In order to become civilized, this nation must have freedom - Freedom of opinion? - Freedom in everything Opinions, clothes, sex You're right about that You know, you have a photogenic face It'd make a great portrait. I want to paint you Just once - What's up, Helmy? Eat - We mustn't let this go - What'II you do? - We must complain to authorities - Hadn't we forgotten? - I'm serious We must get our rights - Our life is our rights - Tell him We'll try... no one knows of what befell us - Others may be unjustly treated - Let's change the subject Salma, Salama, we've gone and returned safely Yes, Salma, Salama, we've gone and returned safely Get up, Qurunfela and dance I've quit dancing for ages Qurunfela... Qurunfela I want to dance for you but since I got disc prolapse the doctor forbade me to dance I'd rather have died. Imagine... I spent 3 years not wanting to see anyone - Qurunfela - Silly me! I've made you gloomy I'm glad to have opened the Karnak Café and met you all Salma, Salama, we've gone and returned safely Chuff, train, come to a stand Let me off in this land Forget America, Europe None surpasses my land It seems you suffered there On the contrary You know, Qurunfela While there I thought that your memoirs would be significant - if we wrote of more than dancing - Like what? Say if we talk of those people you told me about - those who ruled Egypt - You mean scandals? Not exactly... From what you know we can evaluate these people's reign - Understand? - Sure I do I could even tell you of those in power now Yes, but we may not be able to publish that now It's a matter of time. It's bound to be published You know, Helmy Your absence made me sense I truly love you I mean... I love you to an extent I'd never imagined before I know you can never tell how much I... Qurunfela, what's the matter? I have a feeling you'll go one day never to return - You've a great future, while I... - Qurunfela, stop it In Allah's name... Gaber, rely on Allah Alright, officer, just let me see to this customer Yes, dear? Grease, spleen, or sausage skin? - Gather your stuff and leave - Why? Will a procession pass through here? - You're trespassing. It's forbidden - Why? - We're not selling drugs - No questions. It's forbidden Mention God's name and let me see to my living Coy with the government? Remove it or I'll drag you both to the station Is that so, Hasaballah? You're in on this What, you horn seller?

Shan't we earn a living? There! Happy! Be my witnesses. He threw my products, slashed me with a razor I'm bleeding, get me an ambulance - See his face? - I never touched him - Oh my! - That's what I call bold women Bold women, dad?! Are you happy with this? - Should I go to jail? - Why start it? You didn't hear what he said of Zeinab - Damn him - Everyone's slandering us now Give it to me, Ismail With your permission, to stop their tongues, let's recite the Fatiha - But... - No buts We'll recite the Fatiha now and they'll marry after graduating What do you say, Uncle Diab? Give me your hand, Ismail Helmy What's up? Where'd you put the sugar? You could have told us to make the tea You should just study... if we had a woman, she'd handle the kitchen - Just the kitchen? - Back to your books, boy - When I read this book, you can have it - What book's that? Egyptian Patriotic Movement by Shuhdi Atteya Shafi'e When you read it you'll know July 23rd wasn't the start of history How come? In the past also, there were leaders, revolutions & patriotic movements - Goodness me, uncle - Here you go, bride We'd like you to attend our wedding Sure, just study now so you can pass - Find my dad a bride, too - Stop it.

Why not report to us? - I heard nothing - And the lecture conversation? What conversation?

You're one of us now What's this, Zeinab? Whose are these? I found a job at a professor's clinic Congratulations. How nice! See. You're getting lucky already even while studying What did I tell you? Ismail's unaware of your worth You should buy a top and a pair of shoes and open a savings account at the post office Take them all - I don't want them - What? Is that possible? You should use this money to pamper yourself; it's hard-earned Consider them house expenses; buy what you like But it's too much! What'II I do with it? Oh, yes. I can buy extra fabric in addition to the government's We can mend the lock and paint the flat and I'll install a new gas-burner and buy you a new mirror to hang here and I'll make you a dress and buy your dad a galabeya - I woke shivering in terror - Dreaming of a brother's a good omen God protect us It's a nightmare Each of us lives a nightmare by day - and has nightmares at night? - Persecution, I call it - Heard the latest joke? - Forget it.

I mean didn't you die before? I can't remember. I can't remember Death is easy, not like you think There's aspirin... or rushing cars or guys like you All is possible. It's just death, you know What's this? Do you want to die? Sure I do... I've been dying for an hour You're in luck, Ismail Imagine, you've once again proven innocent We're sure your relationship with Helmy's just that of colleagues But he's pigheaded and pretends to be a real Communist Not at all, sir. Helmy's not... Helmy confessed It's a good thing he's no member of a party or organization Frankly, we've no time for amateurs My dad used to say: Khaled, the most important trait in man is loyalty Your loyalty to Helmy makes us covet your friendship Why not be a friend of ours? We'll help you graduate with honors in the future and get you a job you desire. What do you say? We may have inadvertently harmed some but think of the broad public who profited You'll find those harmed a small minority In a few months, you'll be a prominent doctor Ismail, we're carving our way with much effort and are surrounded by many foes Your faith in the revolution mustn't be mere talk If you see or hear of any danger, you must notify us; don't be mute Right? Okay Zeinab - Ismail? - How are you, Zeinab? - Welcome back, Ismail - I missed you Me too Why were you late? I've been waiting for long I couldn't stand being at home Remember when you told me not to look back and to forget? Remember when you said it? - Zeinab... Zeinab - Good night, Ismail Why didn't you come when released? I was receiving news with my father - What's up? - Nothing. He's been given a pension They fired him? Why? Maybe for giving birth to me When he got the ministry's letter he thought they promoted him Not to worry, darling All will be forgotten - As long as you're alive - That's next, no doubt Don't say that, Helmy You have a long life ahead In a few days, you'll get better and your face will light up again - I'll get you a bite to eat - No thanks - Want a drink? - No Cheer up, Helmy.

Helmy We're sick of papers - You ask for the word? - We want to act amid the crowd The country's like a trash can with a stench It must be burnt Burn our country?

Here is a leaflet Approve it, it'll reach the public tomorrow Hi - Evening - Evening - How are you, Helmy? - How are you? Fine thanks. What did you do to Qurunfela? Why upset her?

Don't say that - Where's uncle? - At a private tutorial What else could he do? Beg or die of hunger? He's so strong Learn from him then; don't take it out on Qurunfela When I have time, I'll go apologize I have a bunch of guys inside having a discussion; I'd like you to join - Won't we study? - This is more important Oh, it's you. You scared us I'll do the introductions Farouq, Salah, Mohammed, El-Hadidy Zeinab and Ismail whom we mentioned Hello - I can't approve this leaflet - Why? Our criticism of the revolution must come from within Or we're no different from the backward ones That's what I meant - Then it must be amended - This leaflet... Must be simple, focused and contain clear objectives Can we discuss this in an organized way? Excuse us - Won't you join the meeting? - You see... Sorry. We have to study Where will you study? - Anywhere - Wait Go ahead of me to Mohsen's flat; he's finished exams and left When I'm done, I'll follow Don't do it, Helmy We have exams these days Tear up any leaflets you wrote, Helmy, please - Are you sure of those guys? - Why the fear?

Why, Ismail? I'm uptight - I'm afraid you'll despise me one day - Me? Zeinab. I... Why are you silent? I confessed myself and bore their crimes and torture so they'd stay away from you I was humiliated to protect you from them Why, then? Why? Why? Why? Why? Ismail I--- - What, Zeinab? - Nothing Zeinab, I got worried; I thought they arrested you again At the market I learnt that the bastards arrested Ismail - I ran up the stairs - No way No way Hi, Zeinab. Any news? There's been a misunderstanding - They arrested Ismail and Helmy - That so? I wrote in my report that the group at Helmy's incited him to write the leaflet; he objected; Ismail was there by chance - He'd gone with me - What are you talking about? Ismail and Helmy are innocent - Believe me, sir - Teaching us how to work? It's none of your business. You just deal with your reports But I did all this so no harm would befall them You must release them; have mercy! That's it. I've had much patience with you Let me see to my work; I've no time No; this time I won't be silent - I'll tell all, make a scandal - Is she mad? Take her Bastard! Rascal!

Answer me Have hope, Ismail... all will change For better or worse? Nothing's worse than what we went through Nothing's easier than philosophizing I believe... if I try to laugh I'll be unable I should be the one to say that I killed Helmy; not you We were both criminals and caused his death You didn't inform, at least Even that, I can't say I don't know if I'd have informed We were victims, Ismail Helmy's the victim Helmy But we... we are nothing It's over We can never be the same - Enough of this, Ismail! - Give yourself such advice You're right. But will you remain like this? I can't stand life, or this country or myself or you - Ismail - Don't trouble yourself Your path's not mine I'm a hopeless case. Here you go. Goodbye Ismail!
