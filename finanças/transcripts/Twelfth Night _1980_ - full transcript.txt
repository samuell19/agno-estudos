[upbeat music] [soft music] If music be the food of love, play on, give me excess of it that surfeiting, the appetite may sicken, and so die. [soft music ] That strain again, it had a dying fall. O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound that breathes upon a bank of violets, stealing and giving odour. Enough, no more. It is not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou, that notwithstanding thy capacity receiveth as the sea naught enters there, of what validity and pitch soe'er, but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute so full of shapes is fancy that it alone is high fantastical. Will you go hunt, my lord? What, Curio? The hart. Why, so I do, the noblest that I have. O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, me thought she purged the air of pestilence. That instant was I turned into a hart and my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, pursue me. How now what news from her? So please my lord, I might not be admitted. But from her handmaid do return this answer, the element itself, till seven years heat, shall not behold her face at ample view, but like a cloistress she will veiled walk, and water once a day her chamber round with eye-offending brine all this to season a brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh and lasting, in her sad remembrance. O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love, when the rich golden shaft hath killed the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver, brain, and heart, these sovereign thrones, are all supplied and filled her sweet perfections with one self king, away before me to sweet beds of flowers. Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers. [gust winds] What country, friends, is this? This is Illyria your lady. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother, he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drowned. What think you, sailors? It is perchance that you yourself were saved. O, my poor brother and so perchance may he be. True, madam and to comfort you with chance, assure yourself after our ship did split, when you and those poor number saved with you hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, most provident in peril, bind himself courage and hope both teaching him the practice. To a strong mast, that lived upon the sea. Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves so long as I could see. O, for saying so, there's gold. Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, whereto thy speech serves for authority, the like of him knowest thou this country? Aye, madam, well, for I was bred and born not three hours travel from this very place. Who governs here? A noble Duke in nature as in name. What is his name? Orsino. Orsino. I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then. And so is now, or was so, very late for but a month ago I went from hence, then 'twas fresh in murmur as you know, what great ones do, the less will prattle of that he did seek the love of fair Olivia. What's she? A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count that died some twelvemonth since then leaving her in the protection of his son, her brother, who shortly also died for whose dear love, they say she hath abjured the company and sight of men. O, that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world till I had made mine own occasion mellow what my estate is. That were hard to compass, because she will admit no kind of suit, no, not the Duke's. There is a fair behavior in thee Captain, and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character. I prithee and I'll pay thee bounteously conceal me what I am, and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent. I'll serve this Duke thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him it may be worth thy pains, for I can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap to time I will commit. Only shape thou thy silence to my wit. Be you his eunuch and your mute I'll be. When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see. I thank thee, lead me on. [door knock] What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus I am sure care's an enemy to life. [sigh] By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier Your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours. Why, let her except before excepted. Aye, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order. Confine I'll confine myself no finer than I am these clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. That quaffing and drinking will undo you I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer. Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek? Aye, he. He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria. What's that to the purpose? He has three thousand ducats a year. Aye, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats. He's a very fool and a prodigal. Fie, that you'll say so he plays o'the viol-de-gamboys, speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature. He hath indeed all, most natural for besides that he's a fool he's a great quarreler and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarreling, it is thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave. By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him who are they? They that add moreover he's drunk nightly in your company. With drinking healths to my niece I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria, he's a coward and a coistrel will not drink to my niece till his brains turn to the toe like a parish top, what wench Castiliano vulgo for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface. Sir Toby Belch? [cheers] How now, Sir Toby Belch? Not sweet Sir Andrew. Bless you, fair shrew. And you too, sir. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost. What's that? My niece's chambermaid. Good Mistress accost, I desire better acquaintance. My name is Mary, sir. Good Mistress Mary Accost You mistake knight, accost is front her board her woo her assail her. I my tell, I would not undertake her in this company he said the meaning of for cost? Fare you well, gentlemen. An thou let part so Sir Andrew would thou mightst never draw sword again. Are you part so mistress I would I might never draw sword again fair lady do you think you have fools in hand? Sir, I have not you by the hand. Marry, but you shall have, and here's my hand. Though a thought is free I pray you bring your hand to the buttery bar and let it drink. Wherefore, sweetheart what's your metaphor? It's dry, sir. Why, I think so I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry but what's your jest? A dry jest, sir. Are you full of them? Aye, sir. I have them at my fingers ends marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. O knight, thou lacks a cup of canary when did I see thee so put down? Never in your life I think unless you see canary put me down methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has but I am a great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit. No question. I thought that, I'd forswear it I'll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby. Pourquoi, my dear knight? What is pourquoi do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting O, had I but followed the arts. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. Why, would that have mended my hair? Past question, for thou seest it will not curl by nature. But it becomes me well enough, does't not? Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off. [laughs loudly] Faith, I'll home tomorrow, Sir Toby, your niece will not be seen, or if she be it's four to one she'll none of me the Count himself here hard by woos her. She'll none to the count she'll not match above her degree neither in estate years nor wit. I have heard her swear it tut, there's life into man. [giggle] I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow to the strangest mind in the world I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether. Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight? As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters I will not compare with an old man. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? Faith, I can cut a caper and I can cut the mutton to it. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. Wherefore are these things hid wherefore have these gifts a curtain before them are they like to take dust like Mistress Mall's picture why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto my very walk, should be a jig I would not so much as make water but in a sink that apace [laughs loudly] what dost thou mean is it a world to hide virtues I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was formed under the star of a galliard. Aye, it is strong and it does indifferent well in a flame colored stock shall we set about some revels? What shall we do else, were we not born under Taurus? Taurus that's sides and heart. No, sides it is legs and thighs let me see thee caper. Ha, ha, ha. Higher [murmurs] [soft music] If the Duke continue these favors towards you Cesario, you are like to be much advanced. He hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. You either fear his humor or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favors? No, believe me. I thank you, here comes the Count. Who saw Cesario? On your attendance, my lord, here. Stand you awhile aloof. Cesario, thou knowest no less but all I have unclasped thee the book even of my secret soul. Therefore good youth address thy gait unto her be not denied access stand at her doors, and tell them there thy fixed foot shall grow till thou have audience. Sure, my noble lord, if she be so abandoned to her sorrow as it is spoke, she never will admit me. Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds rather than make unprofited return. Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then? O, then unfold the passion of my love. Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith. It shall become thee well to act my woes she will attend it better in thy youth than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect. I think not so my lord. Dear lad, believe it. For they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man. Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious. Thy small pipe is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound, and all is semblative a woman's part. I know thy constellation is right out for this affair. Some four or five attend him all if you will. For I myself am best when least in company. Prosper well in this, and thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, to call his fortunes thine. I'll do my best to woo your lady. Yet, a barful strife. Who were I woo, myself would be his wife. [soft music] Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, I will open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter, in way of thy excuse. My lady will hang thee for thy absence. Let her hang me, he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colors. Make that good. He shall see none to fear. A good lenten answerI can tell thee where that saying was born of I fear no colors. Where, good Mistress Mary? In the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery. Well God give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools, let them use their talents. Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you? No many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away, let summer bear it out. You are resolute, then? Not so neither, but I am resolved on two points. That if one break, the other will hold or if both break, your gaskins fall. [laughs loudly] Out in good faith very out well go thy way, if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria. Peace you rogue, no more of that here comes my lady. Make your excuse wisely, you were best. Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling. Those wits that think they have thee do very out prove fools and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a foolish wit. God bless thee, lady. Take the fool away. Do you not hear, fellows take away the lady. Go to you are a dry fool I'll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest. Two faults, Madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself. If he mend, he is no longer dishonest if he cannot, let the botcher mend him anything that's mended, is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this simple syllogism will serve, so, if it will not? What remedy as there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty's a flower the lady bade take away the fool, therefore I say again take her away. Sir, I bade them take away you. Misprision in the highest degree good Madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool. Can you do it? O, dexteriously, good Madonna. Make your proof. I must catechize you for it, good my mouse of virtue, answer me. Well, sir for want of other idleness I'll bide your proof. Good Madonna, why mournest thou? Good fool, for my brother's death. I think his soul is in hell, Madonna. I know his soul is in heaven, fool. The more fool, Madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul, being in heaven take away the fool, gentlemen. What think you of this fool, Malvolio doth he not mend? Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly Sir Toby will be sworn I am no fox, but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool. How say you to that, Malvolio? I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard already, unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools zanies. O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove. Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak's well of fools. [laughs loudly] Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you. From the Count Orsino, is it? I know not madam it is a fair young man and well attended. Who of my people hold him in delay? Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman. O, fetch him off, I pray you, he speaks nothing but madman fie on him o you, Malvolio. If it be a suit from the Count, I am sick or not at home what you will, to dismiss it. Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old and people dislike it? Thou hast spoke for this, Madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool whose skull Jove cram with brains, for here he comes one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater. By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate cousin? A gentleman. A gentleman, what gentleman? It is a gentleman here, plague these pickle-herring. How now, sot [laughs]. Good Sir Toby. Cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy? Lechery I defy lechery there's one at the gate. Aye, marry, what is he? Let him be the devil an he will, I care not give me faith, say I. What's a drunken man like, fool? Like a drowned man a fool and a madman. One draught above heat makes him a fool, the second mads him and a third drowns him. Go thou and seek the crowner and let him sit on my cuz, for he's in the third degree of drink he's drowned. Go, look after him. He is but mad yet Madonna and the fool shall look to the madman. Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick, he takes on him to understand so much and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? He's fortified against any denial. Tell him, he shall not speak with me. He's been told so, and he says he'll stand at your door like a sheriff's post and be the supporter to a bench but he'll speak with you. What kind oF man is he? Why, of mankind. What manner of man? Of very ill manner he'll speak with you, will you or no. Of what personage and years is he? Not yet old enough for a man, nor yet young enough for a boy, as a squash is before it is a peascod, or a codling when it is almost an apple it is with him in standing water between boy and man. He is very well-favored, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him. Let him approach call in my gentlewoman. Gentlewoman, my lady calls. Give me my veil come, throw it over my face. We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy. The honorable lady of the house, which is she? Speak to me, I shall answer for her, your will? Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I should be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn. I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage. Which came you, sir? I can say little more than I have studied and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one and give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. Are you a comedian? No, my profound heart and yet, by the very fangs of malice, I swear I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? If I do not usurp myself, I am. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve, but this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message. Come to what is important in it and I forgive you the praise. And as I took great pains to study it and it is poetical. It is the more like to be feigned I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad be gone if you have reason, be brief. It is not that time of moon with me, to make one in so skipping a dialogue. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind I am a messenger. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful speak your office. It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage. I hold the olive in my hand, my words are as full of peace as matter. Yet you began rudely what are you what would you? The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead, to your ears divinity to any others profanation. Give us the place alone. We will hear this divinity. Now, sir, what is your text? Most sweet lady A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it where lies your text? In Orsino's bosom. In his bosom, In what chapter of his bosom? To answer by the method, in the first of his heart. O, I have read it is heresy have you no more to say? Good madam, let me see your face. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face you are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present. Is it not well done? Excellently done if God did all. 'Tis in grain sir, 'twill endure wind and weather. 'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on. Lady, you are the cruellest she alive, if you will lead these graces to the grave, and leave the world no copy. O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted. I will give out divers schedules of my beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labeled to my will. As item two lips indifferent red, item two grey eyes, with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me? I see you what you are you are too proud. But if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you O, such love could be but recompensed, though you were crowned the nonpareil of beauty. How does he love me? With adorations, fertile tears, with groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire. Your lord does know my mind I cannot love him, yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth, in voices well divulged, free, learned, and valiant and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person but yet I cannot love him. He might have took his answer long ago. If I did love you in my master's flame, with such a suffering, such a deadly life, in your denial I would find no sense, I would not understand it. Why, what would you? Make me a willow cabin at your gate, and call upon my soul within the house, write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night. Hallow your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out Olivia O, you should not rest between the elements of air and earth, but you should pity me. You might do much. What is your parentage? Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman. Get you to your lord. I cannot love him let him send no more unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it fare you well. I thank you for your pains spend this for me. I am no feed post, lady keep your purse. My master not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint, that you shall love, and let your fervour like my master's be placed in contempt farewell, fair cruelty. What is your parentage? Above my fortunes, yet my state is well. I am a gentleman I'll be sworn thou art. Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions, and spirit do give thee fivefold blazon. Not too fast soft, unless the master were the man. How now? Even so quickly may one catch the plague? Methinks I feel this youth's perfections, with an invisible and subtle stealth, to creep in at mine eyes. well, let it be! What ho, Malvolio. Here, madam, at your service. Run after that same peevish messenger, the County's man. He left this ring behind him, would I or not. Tell him, I'll none of it, desire him not to flatter with his lord, nor hold him up with hopes, I am not for him. If that the youth will come this way tomorrow, I'll give him reasons for't. Hie thee, Malvolio! Madam, I will. I do I know not what, and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force ourselves we do not owe what is decreed must be, and be this so. Were you even thou the compass Oliver? Even now, sir on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. She returns this ring to you, sir. You might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him and one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord's taking of this receive it so. She took the ring of me, I'll none of it. Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so returned. If it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye, if not, be it his that finds it. I left no ring with her what means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her she made good view of me, indeed so much that methought her eyes had lost her tongue, for she did speak in starts, distractedly. She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord's ring why, he sent her none. I am the man. If it be so as it is poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper false in women's waxen hearts to set their forms. Alas, our frailty is the cause not we, for such as we are made for if such we be. How will this fadge my master loves her dearly. and I, poor monster, fond as much on him and she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this as I am man, my state is desperate for my master's love. As I am woman now alas the day, what thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe O time, thou must untangle this, not I It is too hard a knot for me to untie. Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you? By your patience, no my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore I shall crave of you your leave, that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you. Let me yet know of you whither you are bound. No sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me, what I am willing to keep in, therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then Antonio, my name is Sebastian which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended. But you, sir altered that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. Alas the day! A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder over far believe that yet thus far I will boldly publish her she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already sir with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. O my good Antonio, forgive me your trouble. If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. If you will not undo what you have done that is, kill him whom you have recovered desire it not. Fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that, upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court farewell. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee I have many enemies in Orsino's court, else would I very shortly see thee there but come what may, I do adore thee so that danger shall seem sport and I will go. Approach, Sir Andrew. Not to be abed after midnight, is to be up betimes, and diluculo surgere, thou knowest Nay, by my troth, I know not, but I know to be up late is to be up late. A false conclusion I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements? Faith, so they say but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking. Thou at a scholar let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say a stoup of wine O, here comes the fool in faith. Ah, how now, my hearts Did you never see the picture of we three? [laughs loudly] Welcome, ass now let's have a catch.

For it were as good a deed as to drink when a man's a hungry, to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him. Do it, knight, I'll write thee a challenge or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth. Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count's was today with my lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nay-word and make him a common recreation, do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed. I know I can do it. Possess us, possess us, tell us something of him. Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan O, if I thought that, I'd beat him like a dog. What, for being a puritan thy exquisite reason, dear knight? Well I have no exquisite reason for it, but I have reason good enough. O, the devil a puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swathes the best persuaded of himself, so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. What wilt thou do? I should drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated. I can write very like my lady, your niece, on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands. Excellent I smell a device. I have to in my nose too. I be so think by the letters that thou will drop that they come from my niece and that she's in love with him. My purpose is indeed a horse of that color. Your horse now would make him an ass. Ass, I doubt not. [laughs loudly] O, it will be admirable. Sport royal, I warrant you I know my physic will work with him I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it. for this night to bed and dream on the event farewell. Good night, Penthesilea. O, before me, she's a good wench. She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores me what if does in? I was adored once, too. Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out. Send for money, knight. If thou hast her not in the end, call me cut. If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will. Come, I'll go burn some sack, it is too late to go to bed now. come, knight. ♪What is love ♪ ♪'Tis not herein after ♪ ♪Present mark ♪ ♪Half present laughter ♪ ♪What is to come is still unsure ♪ ♪In delay ♪ ♪There lies no plenty ♪ ♪Men come kiss me ♪ ♪ Sweet and twenty ♪ ♪Youth that stuff wilt not ♪ ♪Endure ♪ [murmurs] Give me some music now, good morrow, friends now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, that old and antique song we heard last night. Me thought it did relieve my passion much, more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and giddy-paced times. Come, but one verse. He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it. Who was it? Feste the jester, a fool that the Lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house. Seek him out and play the tune the while. Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it, remember me. For such as I am, all true lovers are, unstaid and skittish in all motions else, save in the constant image of the creature that is beloved how dost thou like this tune? It gives a very echo to the seat where love is throned. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon it, young though thou art, thine eye hath stayed upon some favor that it loves. Hath it not, boy? A little, by your favor. What kind of woman is't? Of your complexion. She is not worth thee then, what years, in faith? About your years, my lord. Too old, by heaven let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husband's heart, for boy however we do praise ourselves, our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, more longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, than women's are. I think it well, my lord. Then let thy love be younger than thyself, thy affection cannot hold the bent. For women are as roses whose fair flower, being once displayed, doth fall that very hour. And so they are, alas, that they are so, to die, even when they to perfection grow. O, fellow, come, the song we had last night. Mark it, Cesario it is old and plain. The spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones, do use to chant it. It is silly sooth, and dallies with the innocence of love like the old age. Are you ready, sir? Aye, prithee sing.

Now the god of melancholy protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and their intent everywhere, for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. [laughs loudly] Farewell. Let all the rest give place. Once more, Cesario, get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty. Tell her my love, more noble than the world, prizes not quantity of dirty lands. The parts that fortune hath bestowed upon her tell her I hold as giddily as fortune. But it is that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in, attracts my soul. But if she cannot love you, sir? I cannot be so answered. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart as you have for Olivia. You cannot love her, you tell her so. Must she not then be answered? There is no woman's sides, can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart, no woman's heart so big to hold so much, they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, no motion of the liver, but the palate, that suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt. But mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much. Make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that I owe Olivia. Ay, but I know What dost thou know? Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man as it might be perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. And what's her history? A blank my lord, she never told her love, but let concealment, like a worm in the bud, feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy, she sat like patience on a monument, smiling at grief was not this love indeed? we men may say more, swear more but indeed our shows are more than will for still we prove much in our vows but little in our love. But died thy sister of her love, my boy? I am all the daughters of my father's house, and all the brothers too and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady? Aye, that's the theme. To her in haste give her this jewel say my love can give no place, bide no denay. [flute playing] Come thy ways, Signor Fabian. Nay, I'll come if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. Thou not be glad to have the niggardly, rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? I would exult, man you know he brought me out of favor with my lady about a bear-baiting here. To anger him, we'll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue so is it not Sir Andrew? An we do not, it is pity of our lives. Here comes the little villain, how now, my metal of India? Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio's coming down this walk, he has been yonder in the sun practicing behavior to his own shadow this half-hour observe him, for the love of mockery, for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him close in the name of jesting. Lie thou there for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling. It is but fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near, that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more exalted respect than anyone else that follows her. [laughs softly] What should I think on it? Here's an overweening rogue. O, peace contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him how he jets under his advanced plumes. Slight, I could so beat the rogue. Peace, I say. To be Count Malvolio. Pistol him, pistol him. There is example for it the lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe. Fie on him Jezebel. O, peace. Now he's deeply in look how imagination blows him. Having been three months married to her, sitting in my state . O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye. Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown, having come from a day-bed, where I have left Olivia sleeping. Fire and brimstone. O, peace, peace. And then to have the humor of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them I know my place, as I would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman Toby. Bolts and shackles. O, peace, peace, peace now, now. Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my [laughs softly] some rich jewel. Toby approaches, he curtsies there to me. Shall this fellow live? Silence be drawn from us with cars, peace. I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control. And does not Toby take you a blow of the lips then? Saying, cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech. What, You must amend your drunkenness. Out, scab. Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot. Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight. That's me, I warrant you. One Sir Andrew. I knew it was I, for many do call me fool. What employment have we here? Now is the woodcock near the gin. O, peace, and the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him. By my life, this is my lady's hand. These be her very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand. Her C's, her U's and her T's, why that? To the unknown beloved this and my good wishes her very phrases, by your leave wax soft and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal. It is my lady to whom should this be? This wins him, liver and all. Jove knows I love, but who? Lips, do not move, no man must know. No man must know what follows? The numbers altered no man must know if this should be thee, Malvolio. Marry, hang thee, brock. I may command where I adore but silence, like a Lucrece knife, with bloodless stroke my heart doth gore M-O-A-I doth sway my life. A fustian riddle. Excellent wench, say I. M-O-A-I doth sway my life. Nay, but first let me see, let me see, What dish of poison has she dressed him. And with what wing the staniel checks at it I may command where I adore. Why, she may command me I serve her, she is my lady. Why this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no obstruction in this. and the end what should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that resemble something in me softly, M-O-A-I O, aye, make up that he is now at a cold scent. Sowter will cry upon it for all this, though it be as rank as a fox. M, Malvolio! M why, that begins my name. Did not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults. But then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation. A should follow, but O does. And O shall end, I hope. Aye, or I'll cudgel him and make him cry O. And then I comes behind. Aye, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you. M-O-A-I. This simulation is not as the former. And yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft, here follows prose. If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them. Thy fates open their hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang arguments of state. put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered. I say, remember go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so if not, let me see[laughs] thee a steward still, the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortune's fingers farewell. She that would alter services with thee, fortunate unhappy. Daylight and champain discovers not more this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-device the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me, for every reason excites to this that, my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings and cross-gartered even with the swiftness of putting on. O, jove and my stars be praised here is yet a postscript. "Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling, thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee." [laughs] Jove, I thank thee I will smile. I will do everything that thou wilt have me. [laughs and cheers] I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy. I could marry this wench for this device. So could I too. And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest. Nor I neither. Here comes my noble gull-catcher. Wilt thou set thy foot of my neck? Or of mine either? Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip and become thy bondslave? In faith, or I either? Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him, he must run mad. Nay, but say true does it work upon him? Like aqua-vitae with a midwife. If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my lady. He will come to her in yellow stockings and it is a color she abhors and cross-gartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her, which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. [laughs] If you will see it, follow me. To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit! [laughs] I'll make one too. [flute playing] Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor? No, sir, I live by the church. Art thou a Churchman? No such matter, sir I do live by the church for I do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church. Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool? O, no indeed, sir, the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool, sir, till she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings the husband's the bigger I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words. I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's. Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines everywhere I would be sorry, sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress I think I saw your wisdom there? Nay, an thou pass upon me I'll no more with thee. Hold, there's expenses for thee Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard! By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one though I would not have it grow on my chin is thy lady within Would not a pair of these have bred, sir? Yes, being kept together and put to use. O, I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus. I understand you, sir it is well begged. The matter, I hope is not great sir, begging but a beggar, cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come. Who you are and what you would are out of my welkin I might say element, but the word is over worn. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool and to do that well craves a kind of wit. He must observe their mood on whom he jests, the quality of persons and the time, and like the haggard, check at every feather that comes before his eye. This is a practice as full of labor as a wise man's art. For folly that he wisely shows is fit, but wise men folly fallen quite taint their wit. Save you, gentleman And you, sir. Speaks in foreign language. Foreign language. I hope sir you are and I am yours. Will you encounter the house my niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her. I am bound to your niece, sir. I mean, she is the list of my voyage. Taste your legs, sir put them to motion. My legs do better under-stand me sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs. I mean to go, sir, to enter. I will answer you with gate and entrance. Most excellent, accomplished lady, the heavens rain odors on you. That youth's a rare courtier rain odors well. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear. Odors pregnant and vouchsafed. I'll get them all three all ready. Let the garden door be shut and leave me to my hearing. Give me your hand, sir. My duty, madam, and most humble service What is your name? Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess. My servant, sir it was never merry world but lowly feigning was called compliment. You are servant to the Count Orsino, youth. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours. Your servant's servant is your servant, madam. For him, I think not on him for his thoughts, would they were blanks rather than filled with me. Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf. O, by your leave, I pray you. I bade you never speak again of him. Would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that music from the spheres. Dear lady Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, after the last enchantment you did here, a ring in chase of you. So did I abuse myself, my servant and, I fear me, you. Under your hard construction must I sit, to force that on you in a shameful cunning which you knew none of yours what might you think? Have you not set mine honor at the stake, and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving enough is shown, a cypress, not a bosom, hides my heart. So let me hear you speak. I pity you. That's a degree to love. No, not a grise for it is a vulgar proof that very often we pity enemies. Why, then, methinks it is time to smile again. O world, how out the poor are to be proud. If one should be a prey, how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf [clock strikes] The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid good youth I will not have you. And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, your wife is like to reap a proper man. There lies your way, due west. Then westward ho. Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship. You are nothing, madam, to my lord by me? Stay, I prithee, tell me what thou thinks of me? Do you do think you are not what you are. If I think so, I think the same of you. Then think you right I am not what I am. I would you were as I would have you be. Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool. O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of his lip, a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon than love that would seem hid love's night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honor, truth, and everything, I love thee so maugre all thy pride, nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause for that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause. But rather reason thus with reason fetter. Love sought, is good but given unsought, is better. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth. And that no woman has, nor never none shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so, adieu, good madam, never more will I my master's tears to you deplore. Yet come again, for thou perhaps mayst move that heart, which now abhors, to like his love. [birds chirping] No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer. Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew. Marry, I saw your niece do more favors to the Count's servingman than ever she bestowed upon me. Did she see thee the while, old boy, tell me that? As plain as I see you now. This was a great argument of love in her toward you. Slight will you make an ass of me? I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason. And they have been grand jury men since before Noah was a sailor. She did show favor to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valor, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests fire-new from the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for at your hand and this was balked. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion, where you shall hang like an icicle on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valor or policy. An't be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate. Why then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor. Challenge me the Count's youth to fight with him, hurt him in eleven places, my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man's commendation with woman than report of valor. There is no way but this, Sir Andrew. Will either of you bear me a challenge to him? Go, write it in a martial hand. Be curst and brief i is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the license of ink. If thou thouest him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of ware in England set them down go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose pen, no matter about it. Where shall I find you? We'll call thee at thy cubiculo, go. [laughs] This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby. I have been dear to him lad some two thousand strong or so We shall have a rare letter from him. But you'll not deliver it? Never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wain-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy. And his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty. Look where the youngest wren of nine comes. If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me young gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He's in yellow stockings [laughs] And cross-gartered? Most villainously like a pedant that keeps a school in the church I have dogged him like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter that I dropped to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as it is. I can hardly forbear hurling things at him, I know my lady will strike him. If she do, he'll smile and take it for a great favor. [laughs loudly] Come, bring us, bring us where he is. [laughs] I would not by my will have troubled you. But since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you. I could not stay behind you. My desire, more sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth, and not all love to see you though so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage but jealousy what might befall your travel, being skilless in these parts which to a stranger, unguided and unfriended, often prove rough and unhospitable. My willing love, the rather by these arguments of fear, set forth in your pursuit. My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks and thanks. And ever thanks and of good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay. But were my worth, as is my conscience firm, you should find better dealing. What's to do? Shall we go see the reliques of this town? Tomorrow, sir best first go see your lodging. I am not weary, and it is long to night. I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city. Would you'd pardon me. I do not without danger walk these streets. Once in a sea-fight against the Count his galleys I did some service of such note indeed that, were I ta'en here, it would scarce be answered. Belike you slew great number of his people? [laughs] The offense is not of such a bloody nature, albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying what we took from them, which, for traffic's sake, most of our city did only myself stood out for which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. Do not then walk too open. It does not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town. There shall you have me. Why I your purse? Haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. I'll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour. To the Elephant. I do remember. [dog barking] I have sent after him, he says he'll come. How shall I feast him what bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begged or borrowed. I speak too loud. Where's Malvolio? He is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes where is Malvolio? He's coming, madam, but in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam. Why, what's the matter does he rave? No, madam, he does nothing but smile. Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if he come for sure the man is tainted in is wits. Go, call him hither. I am as mad as he if sad and merry madness equal be. How now, Malvolio? Sweet lady ho ho. Smilest thou I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. Sad, lady, I could be sad this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross gartering but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, please one and please all. Why, how dost thou, man what is the matter with thee? Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? To bed aye, sweetheart, and I'll come to thee. God comfort thee why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so often? How do you, Malvolio? At your request, yes nightingales answer daws. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? Be not afraid of greatness it was well writ. What mean's thou by that, Malvolio? Some are born great. Some achieve greatness. Says thou? And some have greatness thrust upon them. Heaven restore thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings? Thy yellow stockings? And wished to see thee cross-gartered. Cross-gartered? Go to, thou art made if thou desir'st to be so. Am I maid. Or else let me see thee a servant still. Why, this is very midsummer madness. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship's pleasure. I'll come to him. Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him. I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. O ho do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter. She sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter [laughs] Cast thy humble slough, says she. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue, in a manner of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her but it is Jove's doing and Jove make me thankful and when she went away now, let this fellow be looked to fellow not Malvolio nor after my degree, but fellow why, everything concurs together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance what can be said? Nothing that can be, can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked. [bell rings] Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him. Here he is, how is it with you, sir? How is it with you, man? Go off, I discard you. Let me enjoy my private, go off. Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him. Did not I tell you Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him. Ah ha does she so? Go to, go to peace, we must deal gently with him. Leave me alone how now, Malvolio? How is it with you what, man, defy the devil? Consider, he's an enemy to mankind. Do you know what you say? La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart pray God he be not bewitched. Carry his water to the wise woman. Marry, and it shall be done tomorrow morning, if I live my lady would not lose him, for more than I'll say. -How now, mistress? -O Lord! Prithee, hold thy peace, this is not the way. Do you not see you move him? Let me alone with him. No way but gentleness, gently. The fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used. Why, how now, my bawcock? How dost thou, chuck? Sir. Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby get him to pray. My prayers, minx, No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness. Go, hang yourselves all you are idle, shallow things, I am not of your element you shall know more hereafter. [laughs] Is it possible? If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction. Why his very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man. Nay, pursue him now lest the device take air and taint. Why, we should make him mad indeed. The house will be the quieter. Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound my niece is already in the belief that he's mad. We may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him at which time, we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen. But see, but see. More matter for a May morning. Here's the challenge read it, I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in it. Is it so saucy? Aye, is it, I warrant him do but read. Give me. Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow. Good and valiant. Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for it. A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law. Thou comes to the Lady Olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly. But thou liest in thy throat, that is not the matter I challenge thee for. Very brief, and to exceeding good sense less. I will waylay thee going home where, if it be thy chance to kill me. Good. Thou kills me like a rogue and a villain. Still you keep of the windy side of the law it is good. Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls. He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better and so, look to thyself. Thy friend as thou uses him, and thy sworn enemy, Andrew Aguecheek. If this letter move him not, his legs cannot I'll give't him. You may have very fit occasion for it. He is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart. Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum-baily. So soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou drawest, swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him away. Nay, let me alone for swearing. [murmurs] [laughs] Now will not I deliver his letter for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding, his employment between his lord and my niece proclaims no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clod pole. But Sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valor and drive the gentleman as I know his youth will aptly receive it into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both, they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices. [laughing loudly] I have said too much unto a heart of stone, and laid mine honor too unchary heart. Something in me that reproves my fault such a headstrong, potent fault it is, that it but mocks reproof. With the same haviour that your passion bears goes on my master's griefs. Here, wear this jewel for me, it is my picture. Or refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you. And, I beseech you, come again tomorrow. What shall you ask of me that I'll deny, that honor saved may upon asking give? Nothing but this your true love for my master. How with mine honor may I give him that which I have given to you? I will acquit you. Come again tomorrow fare thee well. A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell. Gentleman, God save thee. And you, sir. That defense thou hast, betake thee to it. of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not but thy interceptor full of despite, bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick, skillful, and deadly. Your mistake, sir. I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offense done to any man. You'll find it otherwise, I assure you Sir. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath can furnish man withal. I beseech you, sir, what is he? He is knight dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none, but by pangs of death, and sepulchre Hob, nob is his word, give it or take it. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valor. Belike this is a man of that quirk. Sir, No his indignation derives itself out of a very computent injury. Therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me, which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, to me do this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offense to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose. Well, I will do so. Signor Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till I return. [sigh] I Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter? I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more. I pray you sir, what manner of man is he? Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valor [laughs] He is indeed, sir, the most skillful, fatal, and bloody opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him Sir? I will make your peace with him, if I can. O, I shall be much bound to you for it. I am one that had rather go with Sir Priest than Sir Knight, I care not who knows so much of my mettle. Why, man, he's a very devil. I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hits the ground they step on they say he has been fencer to the Sophy. Pox on it I'll not meddle with him. Aye, but he will not now be pacified. Fabian can scarce hold him yonder. Plague on it an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I'd have seen him damned ere I'd have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, gray Capilet. I'll make the motion. [footstep] [birds chirping] Stand here, make a good show unto. This shall end without the perdition of souls. Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you I have his horse to take up the quarrel. I have persuaded him the youth's a devil. He is as horribly conceited of him, and pants looks pale as if a bear were at his heels. There's no remedy, sir, he will fight with you for's oath's sake Marry he hath better be thought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of. Therefore, draw for the supportance of his vow. He protests he will not hurt you. Pray God defend me a little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man. [screams] Give ground if you see him furious. Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy. The gentleman will, for his honor's sake, have one bout with you he cannot by the duello avoid it. But he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you, come on, to it Pray God, he keep his oath I do assure you, it is against my will. [swords clanking] Ah ha ha. Put up your sword. If this young gentleman have done offense, I take the fault on me. If you offend him, I for him defy you. You, sir why, what are you? One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will. Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you. [swords clanks] [groans] O good Sir Toby, hold here come the Officers. I'll be with you anon. Pray sir, put your sword up, if you please. Marry, will I, sir and for that I promised you, I'll be as good as my word. He will bear you easily, and reins well. This is the man do thy office. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino. You do mistake me, sir. No, sir, no jot, I know your favor well, though now you have no sea cap on your head. Take him away he knows I know him well. I must obey. This comes with seeking you there's no remedy, I shall answer it. What will you do, now my necessity makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me much more for what I cannot do for you than what befalls myself you stand amazed, but be of comfort. Come, sir, away. I must entreat of you some of that money. What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have showed me here, and part being prompted by your present trouble, out of my lean and low ability, I'll lend you something my having is not much. I'll make division of my present with you. Hold here is half my coffer. Can you deny me now? It is possible that my deserts to you can lack persuasion, do not tempt my misery, lest that it make me so unsound a man as to upbraid you with those kindnesses that I have done for you. I know of none, nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man than lying, vainness, babbling drunkenness, or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood. O heavens themselves. Come, sir, I pray you go. Let me speak a little this youth that you see here I snatched one half out of the jaws of death relieved him with such sanctity of love and to his image, which methought did promise most venerable worth, did I devotion. What's that to us the time goes by away. But O, how vild an idol proves this God thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature, there's no blemish but the mind. None can be called deformed, but the unkind. Virtue is beauty but the beauty is evil are empty trunks over flourished by the devil. The man grows mad away with him ccome, sir. Lead me on. Methinks his words do from such passion fly that he believes himself so do not I? Prove true, imagination, O, prove true that I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you Come hither knight come hither Fabian. He named Sebastian. I my brother know yet living in my glass. Even such and so In favor was my brother and he went Still in this fashion, color, ornament, for him I imitate O, if it prove, tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love. A very dishonest, paltry boy and more a coward than a hare. His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him and for his cowardship, ask Fabian. A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it. O, slid I'll after him again and beat him. Do, cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword. An I do not. Come, let's see the event. I dare lay any money, it will be nothing yet. Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you? Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow Let me be clear of thee. Well held out, in faith [laughs] No I do not know you nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her, nor your name is not Master Cesario [laughs] nor this is not my nose, neither nothing that is so, is so. I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else, thou knowest not me. Vent my folly he has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney [laughs] I prithee now ungird thy strangeness tell me what I shall vent to my lady? Shall I vent to her that thou art coming? I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me, there's money for thee, if you tarry longer, I should give worse payment. By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report after fourteen years purchase. Now, sir, have I met you again? There's for you. Why, there's for thee and there and there are all the people mad? Hold, sir or I'll throw your dagger over the house. This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats, for twopence. Come on, sir, hold. Nay, let him alone I'll go another way to work with him. I'll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria, though I struck him first, yet it's no matter for that. Let go thy hand. Come, Sir I will not let you go come my young soldier, put up your iron you are well fleshed come on Sir. I will be free from thee [sigh] What wouldst thou now? If thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword. What, what Nay, then, I must have an ounce this malapert blood from me. [swords clanking] [men groans] Aha [sword clanking] Hold, Toby on thy life I charge thee hold. Madam. Ungracious wretch, fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves where manners never were preached, out of my sight be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone I prithee, gentle friend, let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway in this uncivil and unjust extent against thy peace. Go with me to my house, and hear thou there how many fruitless pranks this ruffian hath botched up, that thou thereby mayst smile at this. Thou shalt not choose but go do not deny. beshrew his soul for me He started one poor heart of mine, in thee. What relish is in this how runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream. Let fancy still my sense in lethe steep if it be thus to dream, still let me sleep Nay, come I prithee would thou'dst be ruled by me. Madam, I will. O, say so, and so be [birds chirping] Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate. Do it quickly I'll call Sir Toby the whilst. Well, I'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in it, and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown, ah the competitors enter. Jove bless thee, master Parson Bonos dies, Sir Toby, for as the old hermit of Prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily said to a niece of King Gorboduc, that that is, is so I, being master Parson, am master Parson for what is that but that and is but is To him, Sir Topas. What ho, I say peace in this prison. The knave counterfeits well a good knave. Who calls there? Sir Topas the curate, that comes to visit Malvolio the lunatic. Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady Out, hyperbolical fiend, how vexest thou this man. Talkest thou nothing but of ladies? Well said, master Parson. Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad. They have laid me here in hideous darkness Fie, thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy. Sayest thou that house is dark? As hell, Sir Topas. Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories toward the south, north are as lustrous as ebony and yet complainest thou of obstruction. I am not mad, Sir Topas I say to you, this house is dark. Madman, thou errest I say there is no darkness but ignorance, fare thee well Sir Topas, Sir Topas My most exquisite Sir Topas Nay, I am for all waters. Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown he sees thee not. To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him. I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offense with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

I could not find him at the Elephant. yet there he was and there I found this credit that he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service. For though my soul disputes well with my sense that this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance, all discourse, that I am ready to distrust mine eyes, and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that I am mad or else the lady's mad yet if it were so, she could not sway her house, command her followers, take and give back affairs and their dispatch, with such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing as I perceive she does. There's something in it that is deceivable. But here the lady comes. Blame not this haste of mine if you mean well, now go with me and with this holy man into the chantry by there before him and underneath that consecrated roof plight me the full assurance of your faith, that my most jealous and too doubtful soul may live at peace he shall conceal it whiles you are willing it shall come to note, what time we will our celebration keep according to my birth what do you say?

Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter. Good Master Fabian, grant me another request. Anything Do not desire to see this letter. This is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends? Aye, sir, we are some of her trappings. I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow? Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends. Just the contrary the better for thy friends. No, sir the worse. How can that be? Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly, I am an ass, so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused. If you will let your lady know that I am here to speak with her? And bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty O, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I will awake it soon. Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me. That face of his I do remember well. Yet when I saw it last, it was besmeared as black as Vulcan in the smoke of war. A baubling vessel was he captain of, for shallow draft and bulk, unprizable, with which, such scatheful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet, that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honor on him what's the matter? Orsino, this is that Antonio that took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy. And this is he that did the Tiger board when your young nephew Titus lost his leg. Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state in private brabble did we apprehend him. He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side, but in conclusion put strange speech upon me. I know not what it was, but distraction. Notable pirate, thou salt-water thief, what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, hath made thine enemies? Orsino, noble sir, be pleased that I shake off these names you give me. Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither. That most ingrateful boy there by your side from the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth did I redeem a wrack past hope he was. His life I gave him, and did thereto add my love without retention or restraint, all his in dedication. For his sake did I expose myself pure for his love into the danger of this adverse town, drew to defend him when he was beset, where, being apprehended, his false cunning not meaning to partake with me in danger taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, and grew a twenty years removed thing while one would wink denied me mine own purse which I had recommended to his use not half an hour before. How can this be? When came he to this town? Today, my lord and for three months before no interim, not a minute's vacancy, both day and night, did we keep company. Here comes the Countess now heaven walks on earth but for thee fellow, fellow thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me, but more of that anon take him aside. [bell rings gently] What would my lord but that he may not have wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. -Madam. -Gracious Olivia. What do you say, Cesario good, my lord. My lord would speak my duty hushes me. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear as howling after music. Still so cruel? Still so constant, lord. What, to perverseness you uncivil lady, to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the faithfullest offerings hath breathed out that e'er devotion tendered, what shall I do? Even what it please my lord, that shall become him. Why should I not had I the heart to do it. Like to be a Egyptian thief at point of death kill what I love a savage jealousy that sometime savors nobly, but hear me this, since you to non-regardance cast my faith, and that I partly know the instrument which screws me from my true place in your favor, Leave you the marble breasted tyrant still. But this your minion, whom I know you love, and whom, by heaven, I swear, I tender dearly, him will I tear out of that cruel eye where he sits crowned in his master's spite. come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief. I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love to spite a raven's heart within a dove. And I most jocund apt and willingly to do you rest, a thousand deaths would die. Where goes Cesario? After him I love more than I love these eyes, more than my life, more by all mores than e'er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above, punish my life, for tainting of my love. Aye me, detested how am I beguiled. Who does beguile you, who does do you wrong? Hast thou forgot thyself is it so long? Call forth the holy father. Come, away. Whither, my lord Cesario, husband, stay. Husband? Aye, husband, can he that deny? Her husband, sirrah? No, my lord, not I. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up. Be that thou knowest thou art, and then thou art as great as that thou fear'st. O, welcome, Father. Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, here to unfold though lately we intended to keep in darkness what occasion now reveals before it is ripe what thou dost know hath newly passed between this youth and me. A contract of eternal bond of love, confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands, attested by the holy close of lips, strengthened by interchangement of your rings, and all the ceremony of this compact sealed in my function, by my testimony, since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have traveled but two hours. O thou dissembling cub What wilt thou be when time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? farewell, and take her but direct thy feet where thou and I henceforth may never meet. My lord, I do protest O, do not swear how little faith, though thou hast too much fear. For the love of God, a surgeon send one presently to Sir Toby. What's the matter? He's broke my head across, and he's given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too for the love of God, your help I had rather than forty pound I were at home. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? The Count's gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate. My gentleman, Cesario? Od's li`felings, here he is. You broke my head for nothing and that that I did, I was set on to do it by Sir Toby. Why do you speak to me I never hurt you. You drew your sword upon me without cause, but I bespake you fair, and hurt you not. If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me. I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb. Here comes Sir Toby halting, you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink, he would have tickled you other gates than he did. How now, gentleman, how is it with you? That's all one, he's hurt me and there's the end on it. Sot, didst see Dick Surgeon, sot? O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone. His eyes were set at eight in the morning. Then he's a rogue and a passy-measures pavin. I hate a drunken rogue. Away with him who hath made this havoc with them? I'll help you, Sir Toby, because we'll be dressed together. Will you help, an asshead, and a coxcomb, and a knave - a thin-faced knave, a gull. [laughs] Get him to bed, and let his hurt be looked to. I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman. But had it been the brother of my blood I must have done no less, with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard upon me and by that I do perceive it hath offended you, pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows we made each other but so late ago. One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons. A natural perspective, that is and is not. Antonio, o my dear Antonio. How have the hours racked and tortured me since I have lost thee. Sebastian, are you? Fear'st thou that, Antonio? How have you made division of yourself? An apple cleft in two is not more twin than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian? Most wonderful. Do I stand there? I never had a brother, nor can there be that deity in my nature of here and everywhere I had a sister whom the blind waves and surges have devoured. of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman, what name, what parentage? Of Messaline. Sebastian was my father. Such a Sebastian was my brother too. so went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and shape you come to fright us. A spirit I am indeed, but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb I did participate. were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, and say, thrice welcome, drowned Viola. My father had a mole upon his brow. And so had mine. And died that day when Viola from her birth had numbered thirteen years. O, that record is lively in my soul. He finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years. If nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurped attire, do not embrace me, till each circumstance of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump that I am Viola which to confirm I'll bring you to a captain in this town where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help I was preserved to serve this noble Count. All the occurrence of my fortune since hath been between this lady and this lord. So comes it lady you have been mistook but nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid. Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived. You are betrothed both to a maid and man. Be not amazed right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wrack. Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me. And all those sayings will I over swear and those swearings keep as true in soul as doth that orbed continent the fire that severs day from night. Give me thy hand, and let me see thee in thy woman's weeds. The Captain that did bring me first on shore hath my maid's garments he, upon some action, is now in durance at Malvolio's suit, a gentleman and follower of my lady's. He shall enlarge him fetch Malvolio hither. and yet, alas, now I remember me, they say, poor gentleman, he's much distract. A most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banished his. How does he, sirrah? Truly, madam, he holds Beelzebub at the stave's end as well as a man in his case may do. He's here writ a letter to you. I should have given it you today morning. But as a madman's epistles are no gospels, it skills not much when they are delivered. Open it, and read it. Then look, to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman. By the Lord, madam. How now, art thou mad? No, madam I do but read madness. And your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow vox. Prithee, read it thy right wits. So I do, Madonna but to read his right wits, is to read thus therefore perpend my princess and give ear. Read it you, sirrah. "By the Lord, madam, you wrong me and the world shall know it. Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship, I have you wrote your letter that induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame think of me as you please, I leave my duty a little unthought-of and speak out of my injury the madly-used Malvolio." Did he write this? Aye, madam. This savors not much of distraction. See him delivered, Fabian, bring him forth. My lord, so please you, these things further thought on, to think me as well a sister as a wife, one day shall crown the alliance on it, so please you, here at my house and at my proper cost. Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. Your master quits you and for your service done him so much against the mettle of your sex, so far beneath your soft and tender breeding, and since you called me master for so long, here is my hand you shall from this time be your master's mistress. Sister, you are she. Is this the madman? Aye, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio? Madam, you have done me wrong, notorious wrong. Have I, Malvolio, No Lady, you have pray you, peruse that letter, you must not now deny it is your hand, write from it if you can, in hand or phrase, or say it is not your seal nor your invention, you can say none of this well, grant it then, and tell me in the modesty of honor, why you have given me such clear lights of favor? Bade me come smiling and cross gartered to you, to put on yellow stockings, and to frown upon Sir Toby and the lighter people? And acting this in an obedient hope, why have you suffered me to be imprisoned, kept in a dark house visited by the priest, and made the most notorious geck and gull that e'er invention played on, tell me why? Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, though, I confess, much like the character but out of question it is Maria's hand. And now I do remember me, it was she first told me thou wast mad then, camest in smiling, and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter. prithee, be content this practice hath most shrewdly passed upon thee, but when we know the grounds and authors of it, thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge of thine own cause. [birds chirping] Good madam, hear me speak and let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come, taint the condition of this present hour, which I have wondered at in hope it shall not, most freely I confess, myself and Toby set this device against Malvolio here, upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceived against him. Maria writ the letter at Sir Toby's great importance, in recompense whereof, he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was followed may rather pluck on laughter than revenge, if that the injuries be justly weighed that have on both sides passed. Alas, poor fool how have they baffled thee. Why, some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them. I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir Topas, sir but that's all one by the Lord, fool, I am not mad. But do you remember Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal, an you smile not, he's gagged And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges. I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you [bell rings gently] He hath been most notoriously abused. Pursue him and entreat him to a peace. He hath not told us of the Captain yet, when that is known, and golden time convents, a solemn combination shall be made of our dear souls mean time, sweet sister, we will not part from hence. Cesario, come for so you shall be, while you are a man.
