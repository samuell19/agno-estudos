Why not in the churchyard? - We were poor. If they discovered him dead, they'd put us in prison. Or in a workhouse. In prison? ...that was what Mama said. Where is she now? Inside. - Can I meet her? No, not today! - But we're already here... I said, No! You have been at my house, so now, we can eat. I want to meet your mom. -Leave her in alone! Since we're here... - you promised that we'd eat!

Did you milk the cows? I'm about to. - The master will punish you're being late!. It wasn't my fault. What wasn't? And I'm 2 croquettes short for supper. Not your fault, either? Another problem for the master? - there's a girl in the stable. What girl? - A girl that I found. Her Mama was dead and rotting at a hut in the scrub. Nobody lives in the scrub. - but it's true! She died at Christmas... and I helped to bury her. You what? ... In the bucket, Larus! the bucket! Saints above... Mama? What a stench! Come here! No! Larus! Larus! Larus, you'll have to wash her. What? While I find her some clothes. Scrub her well! You can take a bath later. Ouch! What a filthy girl! Not so rough! It's hard to get the dirt off. Hey! Your hair's all red. It was red under the dirt. Yes, I know. Here you are... What the devil are you doing? Why aren't the cows milked? Stand up! Milk the cows! What's that? Who the devil is she? An orphan girl that Larus found in the scrub. I thought she'd be able to help in the kitchen. We'll take her to the sheriff. Tonight! Shut her up! This is a madhouse! That's better. A little respect. Don't you play with me, my girl. She's biting me! Get off him! Get off him! Do you remember your father's name? Answer the sheriff, girl! That is why we've come. What is your father's name? What is his name? - Was. "Papa". This is getting us nowhere. Can she.. can she stay with us? Only for a while. She'll have to go to the orphanage at least for a time. - She's afraid of the orphanage. - That's all that I can do. -They never bathe there. They don't feed them. - They Live like wild animals. - Listen... Emil! See to her. Damn it! Little devil! Where'd she go? Damnation! She hurt you? - She sure did! That does it! I expect she's run home. Hey, are you Larus? Come here! There's a dead wench around here, do you know where? Tinke's Mama. The house is straight ahead. Gee-up! It's your fault I?m going to the orphanage. You betrayed me. - I didn't mean too. - You should control your tongue. - She beat me! - She beat you... - What are you going to do? - I'm going home. It's been burned. - What? - They burned your house. I saw the smoke. They took your Mama too. - They dug her up? - Yes. She's in the cemetery now. I'll help you, I promise. What's this? Nothing. Listen! You can hide here. You can stay for a while. - Thanks. - But don't be seen. If they find you... ...he'll kill me. And there's more that you should be careful of. Look! I can't see anything. Aren't you going to open the gate? That's Hartad. He's their son. He's weak in the head... and he's very strong and dangerous. One day he picked up a newborn ram. He only wanted to snuggle it. But he held it so tight he killed it. Its blood spurted on him. If he's their son, why does he sleep in here? I Suppose it's because he's more like an animal. Are you an animal too? You sleep in the stable. I'm not their son. I only tend the cows. Look! It's beautiful. Where did you get it? You stole It? - It was my Mama's. Your mama's? What do you mean? After burying papa... ...Mama was too sick to move us. One day she couldn't get out of bed. Tinke... "Return to my parents. . I ran away from their home... ...they can help you". She said. "They'll take good care of you". "Don't lose this". "Show it to your grandfather. From it, he will know you". - "They live in a great house... - ?No, Mama! ...go now." -No! Go now! Go ! You must leave now! Go now... I want to stay with you. I don't want you to. I want to stay with you! Did she tell you where they lived? No. But that is where I'm going. I have to find my grandfather. Larus... have you seen any sign of Tinke? No, I haven't seen her since she ran off. You're sure? - Yes. Don't cry over that girl. The wolves will get her. There are wolves in town? - Wolves? No, don't worry. I can just see her in the teeth of a wolf. Tinke? Tinke? Come quickly! What are you doing, running in like this? - You have to come! - You are ordering me now? It's Tinke. Hartad has her trapped. Hartad! What have you got there? You mustn't take things that aren't yours. Tinke, come here. Come on. Hurry, get a move on? Hartad! mine! Hartad... Hartad...

I thought you were hurt. - No. - I better go. - The whole town is after you. - ?What? - Pretend you're hurt, for a while. Like this. What the devil...? Is she breathing? Is she breathing? I think so. Thank God! She's alive. Poor little girl... Little girl... We thought you got lost and the wolves had eaten you. But you were almost killed in my own stable. Just imagine! You came back to me on your own. We better take her back to the sheriff. She's not going anywhere. There, let me look at you! Lovely girl. Lovely. It'll be hard to keep this dress clean. - it's not for outside. You will stay inside and helped me. Can't I go with Larus? - Larus needs help with the cows. I want you here with me.

From now on, I will take care of you. Alright? I'll see that you thrive. - But for now, you need to rest. - Why? We want you to get well. Oh, yes. They let you play outside? "Cow pat"! Why aren't you tending to the cows? It's Sunday. My day off. you can't play in that dress! I'm not playing with you. I am going to play- with nice children! Can't you be nice , then we could play together. I'm already Nice! Not now. You shouldn't do that. So, why don't you go to your mom and dad's? They're poor and I have to work. - On your day off, I mean They live too far away. Watch it! No, Tinke! Be careful! Hello, Hartad. Look... Thanks. Can you help me with the door? I can't get in my room. How did you get out? I couldn't open the door... -so I went out the window. You are not to go outside! I am too. It's Sunday, my day off. See! It doesn't open. Oh! That's what you do. Hey, it doesn't work from this side. Hi! Where are you going? Home. You're leaving the farm? She won't let me do anything!

I have to find my grandfather. - You still want to see the house? - Why? - They set it on fire. - How do you know, if you didn't see it? Finding your grandfather won't be easy. I know. If you only remembered the names of your mom and dad. I know. Do you remember their names? - No. What do you want that for? - Nothing. - But it's mine. - You have no use for it. It's still mine. Tinke! You're Seven! Whoops! Dear me! Martha? Help me deal with this little wolf cub Martha! Tinke! - Tinke? What's the matter? - Her name was Martha. My Mama... Papa called her Martha. How dare you take Tinke out there! We've been looking in the village. It wasn't him. It was my doing. You wouldn't go there alone. - Well, I did. I followed the cows. - you're such a mess! - What the devil were you doing? - was looking through the ashes. You've been poking around... where... how disgusting! It doesn't stink anymore. - did I ask for your opinion? You might at least have asked permission. Would you have let me? ?May I go out with Larus tomorrow? . - Of course you cannot. See? I'm not allowed to do anything. Foolishness! ...you can do all kinds of things. Can I play, with the other children, in the street? I will find you some nice playmates. Can I sleep with Larus In the stable? No, you will sleep in the bedroom. - You know what? I'll decide when to go with Larus. But Tinke! Aren't you happy here? What would become of you if I didn't take care of you? I'd be sent to the orphanage. I'll run away. and the wolves will eat me. Don't say that! Can I take these flowers to Mama's grave? Yes, but be back soon. In an hour, we'll have supper. Yes, Nanna. I'll be back for supper. What are you looking at? Milk those cows! There was a pile of dirt. I raked it, like the other graves. Then, I put on the flowers. It was very pretty. Can we eat in peace? Oh!... go on... The gravedigger was there. He promised to write Mama's name on a plank for a marker. You remember your Mama's name? Why didn't you tell the sheriff? ...when he asked you? Well! What was her name? Answer the question! Tell her, or you'll get no more supper. What the devil? Do what your told! Don't growl at me like that Sit down. Sit down! Oh God! No! Oh, God! You mustn't do this to me! You must never come in here again. Hartad is nice. Never come in here again, Never! Do you hear me? I'm afraid of nothing, once I bit a wolf. You Did what? - I bit a wolf. You're certainly full of stories. It's true! I bit his ear. So... So her name was Martha, eh? Martha! Martha... What devil is this? Hartad? Get out! Hello, Hartad. Maybe he wants to have supper with us. No... you see, we'll go, OK. Come on, Hartad. No, that isn't your thumb. Go ahead! "Thumb"! Thumb... can you say "Thumb" Thumb.... Listen! There'll be no supper until you say it right. Just give it to him What a glutton! Know what? Nanna's gone to the sheriff's. To tell him about my Mama? Where is she? -She Left. Come and eat. Why did she leave? - To speak with someone. Who to? - Ejnar Poulsen. Isn't he the sheriff?. Why does she need to speak to him again? You think she'll tell him the name of my Mama? - I Hope so. - Maybe he'll help find my grandparents. It's not your concern. Yes, is it. They're my kin and family. - You can't stay here, you know. - I don't want to. Well that's one thing we agree on. - My Mama told me they were rich. -Your family? - What happened? - As a girl she ran from a manor. - They never found her. - A manor? Are they rich people? It's not important as long as they are nice people. And she did not leave a bad family. What are you thinking? Don't you see? She's a pretty girl. Make her more pretty. We'll get something for our trouble. -But I want her. - You are foolish, woman. - She doesn't want you for a mother. - You only think of money. And we don't know if their daughter's name was Martha That's important? If they think she's theirs. And what if we tell nobody about her? I'm sure that she'll settle down. You've just spoken with the sheriff, idiot! I don't want that wolf cub under my roof any longer. You should've been more willing. We might've had more children. Our own. You wanted another like Hartad? It's been more than 32 years... We'll never have another orphan dropped in our arms like this. We?d better act now if we want a daughter. Don't start that, woman! I'm thirsty. - then come with me. Were you listening, behind the door? - Yes. You know that's not permitted, don't you? No. say "Mother Nanna"... You don't want me as your mother. I have a Mama. Then I'll never have a daughter. But you do have a son. Some people, are coming to look at you. I know. My grandmother and my grandfather. . What if they want to take you? But that's why they're coming, right? Will you go with them? You, can come, too. Go with you... that's crazy! Don't expect me to say "good-bye", no way. There. That's better. Where is the soap? What have you done with the soap? Ah, that's better. Home, cows. Get home, cows. Why are you back so early? It's only noon! Eh? I wanted...because... - Because what? - I want to say goodbye to Tinke. You what? I want to say goodbye to Tinke. Just wait! You, just wait! He's just in time. We're ready to go. How are they? -They keep wanting to know Papa's name. You haven't shown them the medallion? - Not yet. Not till they know me. You're a nut, Tinke. - We have to pack your things. No, I can't go. What would happen if you did, and they caught you? I would get a beating. - Yes... and if you don't come. I'll also get a beating. See that box in back of the carriage? Yes, isn't it pretty? You look nice too. We're going now, Thumb. But you're not coming. You're staying with Mom and Dad. We will miss you, you know? Th... Thumb. Thumb. Tinke... Up you go. Oh, yes. For your trouble. Larus! Where are you? What the devil? Larus, You're staying here! Larus! Out of my way. I haven't time for this. Hartad! - Hartad, open the gate. - Thumb. - Open the gate, hear me. - Thumb. Thumb. Thumb? Thumb. - Thumb? - Thumb. Tinke? Do you remember your Mama's name? - Yes. I've told you many times. - Tell us...again. - My Mama's name was Martha. -Of course she says Martha. Do you really believe that a little girl could... Use your head! If you found an orphan girl in the sticks, What would you do? Look for a family whose daughter ran away with an unskilled laborer. Then you say... "I'm your granddaughter!" - Do you think I'm lying? - Martha went to America. And now she laughs at us. Her and that worthless... You don't look at all like my Mama. - No, you don't think so? Well...maybe. Do you know when Mama died? Tinke! Be nice. You mustn't talk of such things. Why not? - Because one shouldn't. But if it's the truth... - Don't discuss it with her. What's the matter, Tinke? Is your stomach upset? That's disgusting, you Brat! Poor little thing! Are you going to be sick again? Lay here. There now. Go ahead darling let it all out. - let it out? That's it Go to sleep. I'll carry her. - Torkil, Be careful! - I'll swing you to the moon! Torkil. Torkil. His name was Torkil. So you do remember! Tinke! This... This is... Hello. I'm Sofie. And she is Louise. Martha is our older sister. She doesn't look like Martha. -She says, I don't either. He'll not believe anything the poor girl says. And what if she is Martha's? It would mean Martha was dead and daddy won't accept that. I don't believe her. -What if it's true? Louise! She's the daughter of your sister. Look at her hair! Nobody in the family has such hair. Could be her father's. - Yes. He was a redhead. That makes Sense. - That doesn't prove anything. His hair was very red. - Can she talk? Why wouldn't she? - She?s been living like an animal. Maybe she's very savage by nature? Or what? Eh? Come along, Tinke. Oh, no! I've forgotten all about Larus May I go and find him? - Where is he? In the box in the carriage. May I go and get him? Has she brought a dog? I'll send someone to fetch him. Let's go to dinner. Very Good... In the name of Jesus Christ we thank you for this food. Amen. Let's eat - Thanks... Tinke? Eat up! Eat! Perhaps she's picky. Picky? No. Maybe you made her loose her appetite. Watch your Manners! - She's never seen a knife and fork. Hold the fork in one hand and the knife in the other. You get he idea? Do something! What do you expect me to do? Make her eat properly. If she was my own flesh and blood, I'd throw her out on her ear. I am your flesh and blood! Don't mock me. Not in this house. Go and sit down! Go! Who the devil is he? He, is Larus. - Larus? My friend. He came with me. You brought him with you? - Yes. Hello, Larus. You slept OK in the box, huh? We don't need any more hands. Feed him, and take him to the sheriff. She's doing that on purpose. That's pure defiance. Put down that plate immediately! In this house you will do as you're told! Do you understand? Give me that plate! Oh, goodness! What a shame! Herman, that's enough! - Don't go taking her side! She did that on purpose. Tinke, get up! What you are doing? - Taking these off. In the dining room? Yes, they're soaked. Can't you see that we are eating here? -Yes. But you, can't see me any more. - Come! Now, I can't see how she's Martha's. No you can't see it, Erik. But she is... Martha' girl. That's just how Martha acted. Isn't that true , Mama? Yes, she was just like this. There, that's better. Would you like an apron? Lift up your arms. That's this? We're going. No, Herman. You're wrong about this. She's Martha's child. Listen to me! - I'm tired of listening to you. There's no evidence that she's the daughter of Martha. There is. Just look at her! She looks like Martha. They're identical. Martha too, got you mad. So angry... Martha is in America. - No, Herman. I don't want to lose another one. - Stop! She's abusing us. Come here! Don't scream! ?Stop screaming! - Martha is dead. - It's the truth! You wait here. When I return I'll deal with you. Giddy up!, Giddy up! Mama told me to find you, that you would help me. My Papa's name was Torkil. -You heard that in the house. His name was Torkil. There are many Torkils. Can you prove you're Martha's daughter? No. No. Katinka? Katinka? What do you want with her? - I have a surprise for her. Oh? - Astrid, what's happening? Are you Katinka? -What do you want? I have a grandchild for you. A grandchild! - Down. Get down! Get out! Why bring us another wench? We have enough already. She says she's Martha's daughter, if so, she's also Torkil's. Torkil's daughter? You know my son doesn't live here. He doesn't have children. - Try to tell that, to her, grandmother! This is your revenge? For not knowing where they went, when Martha ran away from you? You knew. - No, Nobody knew. You knew. Giddy up ... You always knew, all that time. 10 years and I've not seen my own daughter... ?No! ?No! Grandfather! What is your name, little one? Tinke. Tinke? That's what they called me, when was a little girl What did your father look like? His hair was red, and he had freckles in the summer. He had a birthmark, right here. But...they are both dead? Those devils! I hoped to find someone that was like my Mama. And if there's someone here that looks like your daddy? I'm your Papa's sister. Now, do you believe me? What are you doing here? I told you to wait. You must learn to obey. - I'll learn. No! Oh, no ... This is Gudrun. - Hi, Gudrun. Thanks. There are a couple of boys here, to play with. Larus! - Who is he? My best friend! ?Tinke! ?Tinke! Come here! No, Tinke! Tinke, Wait! Look ... Take it. It's yours. Where did you find it? -Your friend gave it to me. I'm Sorry, Tinke. Are you going to die now? No... I'm not sure. Just before Mama died, she called me to her... ...and she called "Papi" I thought she was calling my Papa. But she must have been asking for you. Don't you fear the wolves? No. No. I believe... I'm not going to die, after all. Come along, Tinke. I'll come and visit you. You want to live here? May I? It's up to you. - It's up to me? I better get back. - No, Larus. Yes! It's better that I get that whipping over with. Goodbye, Tinke. Goodbye. Tinke! Tinke! Tinke! Tinke! Larus! Running away again? Not at all. I have a new job! Looking after the gentleman?s granddaughter... See you soon... Subtitles by fenwron
