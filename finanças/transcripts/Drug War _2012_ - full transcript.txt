"Welcome to JinHai." Pay the toll. You're spaced out! - I don't have enough cash. - I still have. Hello? We just arrived at Jinhai... and are going through the toll station. Hello? Shit! Mine is also out of battery. Hurry up! Sweet! "Jinhai Highway Toll Station." What's wrong with your vehicle? The water tank is overheated. Can we get some water from your office? Let me ask. Calling Control Center... Go ahead. An overheated bus needs to refill water... Something's wrong? I don't think so. He said the water tank's overheated. Just drive over there. Thank you.

Among all those arrested... he has the largest quantity in his body. Li Guangcheng. Doc, according to your estimation... how many pods did he carry? Roughly about twenty-two. Is he okay? The drug pods found in his colon are intact. There's no sign of cracks. But look at this. The edge of the pods inside the colon... has displayed some shiny spots. They should be "air crescent signs." We should treat him first to avoid a rupture. You motherfucker! You betrayed me! I'm a cop, you a drug trafficker. I didn't betray you; I busted you. You betrayed me! You betrayed me! - Let me look at this guy's profile. - Sure. You want me dead! Didn't you know you'd be executed one day? You son Of a bitch! I'll kill you! Go shit yourself! Don't push me!

Retrieve the video record of this intersection. Number Withheld. Go to the previous block. Number Withheld. Hello? Yup. Speak up. Guo and Chen... communication lost. Play this again. A red sedan. This way. Canton AG 1226. Okay. A green truck... Canton AH0386. Raw materials for amphetamine. Got it. I saw those two vehicles at the toll station. The guys in the truck looked like junkies. They suspected it's carrying raw materials for. Two of our colleagues followed them from Yuejiang... but communication was lost. Headquarters asked us to back them up. We may locate them here. Captain Zhang. Come and take a look. Doctor! The pods have broken! Doctor! Where? Where? Come here quickly. The suspect has escaped. Did you find him? Captain Zhang, the suspect has escaped. When? Just a moment ago. Captain Zhang. Go to the mortuary. Yes, sir. Get out. Hello? I spotted them. They're in Heping District, going west to Gaokai Road. Good. I'll be right there. Come with me, Xiang. The rest go back to Headquarters. Yes. We're on Gaokai Road. Go straight ahead, turn right to Deming for Nanshan Road. They've gone up to Sanhuan Flyover and back to Gaokai. Looks like they're beating about the bush. I've spotted them. Xiao Bei, go back to Headquarters first. Got that. Xiang, go greet our dudes from Yuejiang. Yes, Captain. Hey dudes... I'm Captain Zhang from Jinhai's Anti-Drug Squad. The guy ahead is Xiang, my colleague. Yes, Captain. I'm Guo. Chen here. We're from Yuejiang's Anti-Drug Squad. How are you? What's in that truck? It's carrying raw materials for amphetamine. Captain... You must have heard of Bill Li? You kidding? Who hasn't? Never met him, though. We suspect those are his goods. We've been tailing the truck since yesterday. We didn't expect to have followed it for 24 hours. All the way from Yuejiang to Jinhai. We appreciate that. Take a break. Our colleague will assist you. Thanks, Captain. Shit, still no answer. Xiang, you keep an eye on them. Yes, Captain. Timmy Choi, 39, Hong Kong citizen. There's a green truck. Plate number Canton AH0386. Any idea about that? No? Your mobile indicated... 33 calls from the guy in the truck. How do you explain that? We've found your drug factory on Lishuang Road. Two men and a woman died in an explosion. The woman was your wife. The men were her brothers. Wanna talk about them? Do you know according to Clause 347 in Chinese Law... you'll be sentenced to death... for manufacturing over 50 grams of amphetamine. I suppose your factory produces that by tons... instead of grams. Right? The 34th time. Should I answer it for you? The truck... carries raw materials for me. I've got to deliver them to Haha. Who's the supplier? Bill Li. What's the meaning of those numbers in the messages? They're codes of those obsolete beepers. What's the meaning of the last message? 186149... 18 is for "tonight"; 614, "Jinhai"; 96, "Golden" 07, "Horse"; 90, "Hotel"; 62, "Brother"... 95, "Chang"; 24, "To meet"; 11, "Haha"... Tonight, Jinhai, Golden Horse Hotel... Brother Chang to meet Haha. The codes belong to which telecom company? Jiaxun. Who is Chang? LiShuchang. Bill Li's nephew. The codes are correct. Chang knows Haha? No. I'm to introduce them to each other tonight. I have two disciples. I own an even larger factory in Erzhou. I can get a truck to pick up some goods over there. If I don't deliver the goods, Bill will get suspicious. I don't want a death sentence. Let me redeem myself. I just want a suspension. We're running out of time. We've been driving around for nine hours! I've called you a million times. The reactor exploded! Go to Erzhou now. I'll come look for you. Xiang. Captain. There's a drug factory in Erzhou. The truck will deliver the goods there. Go there with the Yuejiang dudes. Sure. Liu. Xiao Bei. Yup. Let's go. Timmy! Sis! Haha! My good brother! Is your veneral disease showing on your face? Chang. This is Haha. This way, Chang. What happened to you? There's an accident at the factory. What about our goods? - Have a seat. - I'll fix that. Sit over there. We might have a visual of our target. Yes. Send a snapshot. These all came from my port. Fish, prawns, crabs, abalones! All these and everything! Tons of them are traded everyday. You think I'm bluffing? Do you have any idea how many fishing boats I own? Over seventy! Abalones this size, I fly them to Australia... back and forth, forth and back! Four times a day. Let's sit down and take a picture. Come here. Let's do it here. Come! Strike a pose. How fussy! One, two, three! Easy! Chang, Timmy told me... that you're into this. I've prepared this first-rate stuff... for your pleasure. Rubbish! This is what I'd call the best. Although I sell them... I never use them myself. It brings one wealth. But it also damages the brain. Haha, let's cut to the chase. I never bullshit. I knew a big boss in Northeast. He owns nightclubs... entertainment centers, karaokes! Hundreds of them! He'll buy whatever stocks you have. Chang. Try the shark fin soup. This boss you're talking about... isn't he the one who received us last time? The guy who called himself Bull? It's Black Bull! He's truly bullish! In all manners. Use some vinegar. Didn't you also know some Japanese thug... who'd act as our agent in Japan? He's no thug! He's Tsukasa, head of Yamaguchi-gumi. Everyone in Kabuki-cho knows him. Really? Are you bluffing? I'm not. Do you trust me? You... you surely trust me. Do you? I can do whatever I want in Seoul. Have you heard of Kim Ji-Hoon? Ever heard of him? Seoul, Busan, Gwangju... those are his turfs. With the Korean, the Japanese... the Northeastern Boss, Haha and me joining hands... Chang, we'll be very safe. I'll arrange a meeting between you and Uncle Bill. Thank you, Chang. Dude! You're a true mate! Is that Li Shuchang? Yes. Over seventy! The Captain is coming down. The Korean, the Japanese, and the Northeastern. Do you trust me? Do you? Of course I do. Go to hell! You're marvelous. Are you happy? Yes. Great. I'll get you an 8-karat ring tomorrow. Don't waste your money. That's a deal. - Sorry! - How careless! Excuse me! What are you doing? - Just lending a hand. - Thank you very much. Thank you. - Which floor, my dear? - Honey! How're things? All done. Let's go. Isn't that perfect? Perfect. Are you happy? Happy- Smile! Chang! Welcome. Please come inside. Chang, this is Mrs Haha... Haha! Chang. Welcome! Have a seat. They're all from my port. Fish, prawns, crabs, abalones! All those fucking seafood... tons of them everyday! I'm not bluffing. Any idea how many fishing boats I own? Over seventy! Help yourself, please. Sorry, I only sell them. I never use them myself. It's bad for the brain. Excuse me! I've got a big mouth. Sorry! For you! My treat! If you don't take that, there's no further talk. Ever heard of Black Bull in the Northeast? Ever heard of Tsukasa from Yamaguchi-gumi in Japan? Ever heard of Kim Ji-Hoon from Korea? They're all my buddies. I can sell your goods to... the Northeast, Japan, Korea... We'll take whatever you supply. This is from Uncle Bill. Take it and you're Uncle Bill's friend. Another round. That's enough. Sure. Enough. You wanna kill him? Come on! Go toYuejiang tomorrow... And have lunch with Uncle Bill. Thank you, Chang. Thank you, Chang. Goodbye, Chang. I'm itchy... There're bugs all over me... Stop scratching! It's just an illusiuon! Squau. Captain! There're bugs crawling over me! Get up! His heart is beating violently. Quick! To the hospital! Dial emergency. Don't let him lie on the floor. Help him stand up. Get up! Walk! Keep walking! Shut up! Don't call... Give him water! Shut up! Water! Water! He needs to throw up. Keep drinking. Water. Give it to me... Make him an ice bath! LCe! LCe! I'll go get it! Don't move. Water! Captain! Move! Kneel down! You patted Chang on his arm. What did that mean? What do you mean? I was trying to stop him... from bullying you. Captain Zhang... I've been collaborating and I've saved your life. If you still think I'm playing tricks... forget about getting Haha or Uncle Bill. Can we make it to the last speed train to Erzhou? Yes, we can. Captain, the truck just crashed on a pile of rocks. The two guys in the truck are fighting with each other. Seems like they're having a row. Where are you going? Wait a sec. Hello? Where the hell are you? On the speed train. Where are you? How the hell do I know? I'll come pick you up. Where am I? Where are you? We're on Highway 104, just passed Wuyi. He's running towards me. Where am I? Get away! He's mad! He's getting mad! Do you know where I am? Highway 104, just passed Wuyi. Thank you! I know where I am! I'm on Highway 104, just passed Wuyi. Wait for me. I'll be there shortly. - Captain Liu. - Captain Zhang, The factory is under surveillance. This way. Make sure that I can see every single corner in the factory. D450, please. Any word or act that seems suspicious to me... I'll call off the operation at once. Understood. You'll be finished if you can't redeem yourself. Understood, Captain. Thank you. Are you stoned again? It's your problem. Don't count me in. I told you. There's an explosion. Look at his face. Attention everybody. He may try to escape. They are wasted. Let me drive. Pick up the pistol. Captain Liu, from Erzhou. Nice to meet you. I'm Guo from Pearl River. I'm Chen. Xiao Bei from Tianjin. Xiang. Lin is in charge of sign language translation. Master, what happened to your face? Unload the goods first. Unload the goods first. This is urgent. Quick. Understood. You can determine the profit share. No, no. You name it, Master. Let's eat first. My wife died. She and her two brothers were killed in the explosion. I only had time to bury them hastily. Get some incense for sacrificial offerings. Where do I get them? Go buy them. The stores are all closed now. Stop. Dead people can't use real currency. This is the least we can do for missus. Stop. It's real money. You can't burn them. This is to show our respect to Master. We owe it to him. Li Shuchang. 21694786. 21 "Afternoon", 619, "Crown", 47, "Top Floor", 86,"Bar"... "Meet you at the top floor bar at Crown in the afternoon." Timmy, forgive me for what happened. We were stoned. Are the goods okay? We'll go back to Yuejiang and report to Uncle Bill. We'll go now. Let's go! We'll go, too. You have enough cash? Thank you. That'll be enough. Let's go. We'll take the first speed train. See you in Yuejiang. Rest in peace, my love. Bless me. Have some rest. I'll keep watch. I'm not tired. You take a nap... I'll keep watch. Cut the crap. Go to sleep. Be careful. You two take a nap. I'll keep watch. I'm okay. Chang, we'll be there in 5 minutes. Save the trouble. We'll meet here. It's Uncle Bill! Saw the white van in front of us? Deliver my money over there... and take the heroin for me. Uncle Bill, we're here to talk shop... not for delivery. Hurry! The traffic light is turning green soon. Captain, what shall we do? Shall we take action? Stand down. We're not sure if it's really heroin. They may be testing us. Don't expose ourselves. Uncle Bill, it's all set. The goods are with me. It's a gift for you. See you in Tianjin tomorrow. I'd like to visit your port. Want a puff? Tell Haha we'll have the transaction tonight. Tell the mute brothers to prepare for delivery. Hurry up! Time for delivery. Once you're done, text me. Okay. Sis, Haha. Buddy! Good timing, join us for the hotpot! Let's get the business done first. The 30 million bucks are all here. Come, drink some more. Not too much, sis. Buddy! Please speak on my behalf... to Chang and Uncle Bill. Once the goods are here, we'll go on board in 5 minutes. It'll take 6 hours to the Northeast, half a day to Korea, one day to Japan... It's damn quick! The amount is right. Listen to your sis, let's join hands in making a fortune. Whoever flunks is a son of a bitch. Cheers. What the hell... This is Jinhai's Coast Guard. We'll be checking your boat. This is Jinhai's Coast Guard. We'll be checking your boat. Don't move! Stand there! Timmy Choi! You motherfucker! I'll kill every single member of your family! Captain You, it's almost dawn. I'll leave the fishing boats to you. Don't worry! We'll take off. There's a situation in Erzhou! Captain Lau and Lin were killed. Many were injured. The mute brothers escaped via a secret passage. Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us there's a secret passage? This is... impossible. I told you everything. Captain Zhang... Take him back to Headquarters. I had no idea! I really had no idea! Believe me! Give me a chance. We have to meet Bill Li tomorrow. We won't need you. Send him back. I'll get a death sentence... I beg you. Give me a chance. Captain... Captain! I beg you. Give me a second chance. I don't wanna die. You'll need me! You'll need me alright! It's useless to arrest Bill Li. There're seven Hong Kong guys behind him. They traffic drugs together in the Mainland. Bill Li is only a front. What else are you hiding? Sorry, Captain. Among the seven of them... one is my brother and another my godfather... I don't wanna betray them... I don't want them to die! I've told you everything. Don't you dare cheat me again! They'll be at the port in an hour's time. Live or die... I'll be with you. I'll let you live for another hour. I'm telling the truth. You'll find out at dawn. The one with the hat is Hatred.

Are these boats his? No bullshitting. Have a seat, Uncle Bill. Are these boats all yours? Not even half of what we own. Others are out on the sea. This is my sea. And this is my fleet. The goods are here. To be on board within 5 minutes. Take them 6 hours to reach the Northeast. Korea, half a day; Japan, one day. You supply, I do the distribution. We'll be perfect partners.

Order the third and fifth boat from the left... and the fourth and sixth from the right... to start sailing.

Set sail! Just a few boats are no big deal! Let's move them all, all of them! WOW, Uncle Bill... This is new for me, too. With all due respect to you... Tell them to leave the port, every single one. Master You... I want all boats to leave the port! Yes! All boats listen... Ready to set sail! Bravo! Fucking junkie! Uncle Bill, can we talk business now? Let's vote. This Haha guy is really something. - I'm okay. - Me, too. Very 0K8)!- I'm okay, too. Anything wrong, Fatso? Hungry marketing... let's whet his appetite first. Do you know where The Stage is?

Uncle Bill... 400kg K-powder, 200kg cocaine, 100kg amphetamine... How much do these cost? Uncle Bill doesn't feel well today. We'll talk another time. Fuck you! Fuck! Why are you sending signals? Last time you used your hands, this time your feet. No shooting here! Fuck off! What's this? Who are these two guys? You're too sensitive. If you fear so much, just quit. I'm asking you. What is this? Are you an undercover? Has Haha gone mad? We're talking about over 100 million RMB. And this isn't a one-off deal. Showing our faces will blow our identities. High risk. High return. High return. High risk. 120 million RMB... When you do want the goods? Know what? If we get caught, we'll all get a death sentence. Let's lie low. Those two jerks are just small potatoes. Shit! How do I know if you're cops or not? If we're cops, we'd have busted you... instead of fooling around with you. Understood. So all of you added up to one Uncle Bill, right? You've scared the shit out of me. We have your order in stocks. We can deliver anytime. As quickly as tomorrow. That'll be great. Tomorrow! How about the payment? Cash on delivery. My port.

Can he still be trusted? Stop pressing the horn, dickhead! Damned noisy! One should know when to press the horn... They don't know anything about the rules of driving. Sheer impoliteness! Ask them where the truck is. Hello? Where are you? Outer Circle Road... Just passed Weihe Road. Tell them to exit at X441. Exit at X441. What? 444? What the fuck!
