Hello, Fred. Keeping out of trouble? How would I be in trouble? You guys back from Viet Nam get kind of restless, you know. Well, take it easy. Where are you heading? To Dr. Wellesley if that's okay with you. No, no, just checking. Do me a favor will you, Phil. Keep off my back. Sure thing. - Hi. - Hello, Fred. Fred, don't forget we're expecting you tonight. Oh, I wouldn't miss it, Mrs Manning. Frank, what time do I pick you up? Well, I'm due at the doctor's at four. It shouldn’t take to long. - Something really wrong with you? - No, no. You know doctors. They're not happy unless they're making their the little tests. Dr. Wellesley is a really fine doctor, isn't he? Quite a lady's man too, I'm told. Well, he’s not my style. Bye, dear. Dr. Wellesley's office. Oh, yeah... Well... How about... 2 on Monday? Fine, thank you. So, when do you start back to college? Oh... As soon as Dr. Wellesley has sent me away. By the way, Fred, I've been meaning to ask you. What do you tell people you're coming here for? - I just say I have an allergy. - It's pretty good. We had one fellow who used to tell people it was for acne. Acne... That's more humiliating that what I have. Dr. Wellesley's office. No, I'm sorry. He's still out making house calls. - I'm so glad you could get away. - Darling... - Frank's in your waiting room. - I had to see you. I just had to see you. You know, it's funny. I've got a nurse who's supposed to chaperone me with my female patients. - But here I am... - Here you are involved with one. Not as involved as I'd like to be. Lisa... You will speak to Frank again, won't you? It won't be any good. He says no divorce. You tried to offer him... money? You know, the trouble with Frank is that is really a nice guy. All he wants to do is get along with me. Yes but I want you, Lisa. I want you now. Not when Frank gets ready to release you. Dr. Wellesley will fix you if anybody can. Though to tell you the truth, I don't trust any of them. - Doctors? - Not a one. I have a lot of confidence in Dr. Wellesley. - Frank said something odd the other night. - What was that? He said that you didn't inherit your father's practice, that you had to buy it from the estate. - Yes, as a matter fact that's true. - It is? Well, my father wanted me to go to his practice right away with them and... I had a few things I had to get out of my system first. Yeah, I remember that. They say you could get a lot on your system as the ship doctor. It had its moments. But after I got married... my wife wanted I set up practice in her hometown. My father took that as a kinda personal rejection. He never knew her, did he? No, it might have been different if he had. Then she died... and he died. Poor baby. - I've got to get back. - All right. That should do for another day. Thanks. I know I said it a lot. I really mean it. Thanks. Mm?… Oh… Sure, sure, Fred. Most of guys have picked the habit in not to have to go cold turkey. If they go at all. - I really don't think I can take that, you know. - I'm glad to help. - Tomorrow same time, then? - Yeah, sure. Hey, listen, I don't mean to binge here. I mean... I guess you've got plenty on your mind without me. I supposed you could say that, Fred. Take it easy. Must be quite a mark up on X-rays, Ron. You take so many of them. Only fair. Real profit is an imaginary ailment. One of my bestsellers. I bet. All right, Frank. I'll phone when I get the results of your tests. Oh, by the way, I... I took a business trip couple weeks ago... to Hagerstown. - Hagerstown? - Mhm... How long were you in practice back there? Oh, about five years. Is that right? Five years? Yes, you are well remembered back in Hagerstown. - Glad you came, Fred. - Glad to be here. You think Fred Kramer will be all right? You said he had pretty hard. Oh, I think he's having a little fun. - Lisa... - Ron, I spoke to Frank. You'd better know we're going away. - Going away? - Europe for a few months. It's a common prescription for couples getting another chance. What about us? Darling, it because of us. We'll just have to stop. We haven't done anything! - We would. - We will. - How did his tests came out anyway? - Oh, he's fine. He has a small cyst on his shoulder I'll have to remove in just a… minor office procedure. You couldn’t manage to lose him on the operating table, could you? That's nothing to joke about. No, of course not. Ron... I'm sorry about everything. Excuse me. - I buy you a drink, Ron? - You couldn't have timed it better. - Having a good time? - Yes, yes, just fine. - Oh, thank you, cheers. - Cheers. She dances well, doesn't she? Lisa?... Yes, I... I suppose so. Ron, I... I did something recently which I'm not particularly proud of. Oh, what was that? I hired a private detective. You did? What for? I know Lisa was interested in another man. Phil Proctor? I'm talking about you, Ron. Please, don't bother to confirm or deny it. I also have you checked out pretty thoroughly back in Hagerstown. - What for? - Well, I was curious. I wanted to know more about certain stories I've heard. About you and those... strange deaths. I had to see this Dr. Waterbury while I was out in Hagerstown. - It was a bad break for you really. - Waterbury, uh? Not one of my biggest boosters. He said that people out are pretty well convinced you're involved in both deaths. The man and the wife. One after the other. In fact, the word he used was er… "murdered". It makes quite a story, doesn't it? - I thought so. - There isn't a single word of truth in it. - Never was a shred of evidence. - Not enough to bring to the court. Apparently enough to drive you out of town. Did Waterbury happen to tell you what this whole affair was based on? The awful fact that my mother-in-law died of a heart attack one year and... Helen died at the same cause the next. They wonder why you're signed both death certificates yourself. It's not unusual. - And why the quick cremations? - It's what they wanted. Frank, if you checked this out, you must know that the charges came from a cousin of Helen's who hoped to inherit their money. Yes, but the money did come to you, didn't it? Mother to daughter to you. They assume that was the motive. - Do you watch much television, Ron? - No, not much, why? I guess the only thing I ever learnt from it was a meaning of... "M.O." - "M.O."? - Mhm... "Method of operation". Cop talk. The criminal's tendency to repeat a successful method. First, there was Carol Hansen, wasn't there? Your detective was pretty thorough, wasn't he? It is possible, isn't it, to imitate heart attack symptoms with certain drugs like insulin. Carol Hansen died of a sudden heart attack too. - And you signed that death certificate. - She was a stewardess, I was the ship's doctor. She was carrying your child, wasn't she? It could have been mine, I told them that at the time. Things do happen to your women, don't they? Look Frank, I'm sick defending myself against baseless charges. You believe what you like. I couldn't care less. Now that was the first false note. You were very good until then. How long do you think you'd last here in Woodfield if I were to spread the story around? Is that what you intend to do? I haven't told anyone yet. I don't see any reason why you'd want to. - I don't really. - Then what's this all about? You can't imagine that I enjoy going through this old witch-hunt all over again. The fact is, Ron, I'm... I'm hoping for an accommodation with you. - Accommodation? - Mhm... I'm hoping I can persuade you not to murder me. You're not serious, Are you? I thought I was. For Heaven's sakes, why would I want to kill you? Because I'm like the others. I'm in your way. You're not serious. Why would you keep coming to me as a patient if you thought I was gonna kill you? Oh, I was safe enough as long as you thought there might be a divorce. But you know better now. You decided how I intend to do it? Like the others. I think I'm a candidate for a heart attack. You said as much yourself. I told you there was no immediate cause for worry. I worry. I went to a heart specialist and had another EKG (Electrocardiography). There's nothing wrong with my heart. I hope he's right. You know, Frank, EKGs don't read as simply as market reports. Different men often get different readings. I was surely there would be some medical cop-out. There usually is. It’s the strength of our profession. I know I could be wrong about you, Ron. That's the first nice thing you said to me all day. I realise it's been innocent between you and Lisa so far. But I can't allow this to go on. The only thing that would make sense is you to go. Go? Where? Anywhere. - Away from Waterfield. - Oh, come on, Frank. You'll be gone by the time Lisa and I get back from Europe or I'll spread the word about your colorful past and drive you out of town. - You'd do that too, wouldn't you? - Believe me, Doctor. Right or wrong, I won't roll over and play dead for you. I suppose that means that... now you won't want me to take care of that cyst for you. I have to have it done anyway. It might seem peculiar if I would suddenly change doctors. But I should tell you I've taken certain precautions. - Your detective? - No, no. I've paid him off. He gave me all I need. Look Franck, how do I get through to you? I'm a doctor. I don't deliberately kill people. Hey, Ron! You got an emergency. The hospital sent me to get you. Come on, We'll make better time - in my car. - All right, Phil. Thanks for the game, Frank. I enjoyed every minute of it. How is she? - We lost Mrs Sullivan. - Oh, it's a shame. I drive you home now? I need a couple of minutes. I tell you... Why don't you go into the doctor's lounge and have cup of coffee - and I'll meet you there? - Sure, I'll wait for you. Miss Regis, what time is Fred Kramer coming in for his treatment today? Good. Miss Regis, it's important that we get another test on Mr. Manning. The lab needs it. Have him come in this afternoon. We'll remove the cyst at the same time. Ah... Better now? I never quite got used to losing a patient. Come on, Ron, you're a good doctor. Yes, I suppose so but... it's hard not to feel that if I've done my job a little bit better that... It's not as if I've done it deliberately. Why would you have done that? She leaves any money or anything? Not that I know of. - Is that a serious question? - Remember Dr Adams, the British doctor? They had him up on knocking some of his patients just because they happen to remember him there wills. The jury found him innocent. You are not suggesting there is any connection, are you? No, no, I've just got homicide on the brain. It's this course something. The one for the exams for Captain... Was I supposed to lend you a book on forensic medicine, wasn't that? Yeah… What if doctors had been murderers? You'd be surprised how big they'd been in the field. One of the great traditions. - Dr. Crippen, Dr. Palmer, Dr. Clemens. - Giants. I guess because it'd be so easy for a doctor. Our instructor said an interesting thing once. He said... homicidal types like that, you gotta think them like a loaded revolver just waiting to be pointed at somebody. Cheerful thought. Phil, you've made my day. At least, you got your mind off things. Right through here, Mr. Manning, please. You just remove your shirt. You can wait here. I hope you won't keep me waiting too long. Look, Mr. Manning... Either the patient wait for him or he waits for the patient. Who's time is more valuable? Some of his patients do important work too, you know. But dollar for dollar, I mean. - Oh, I see what you mean, yes. - In the healing art, time is money. - You’re very funny. - We take an oath. "Cheer up the sick and dying." Well, there goes another one. - Another what? - Another patient. He howls every time we lose one. - Your dog knows? - It's spooky how he knows. - He doesn't do it very often, is he? - Oh, now and then. Listen, you can win them all. Now, Happy, you quiet down! Stop it and quiet down. Happy, you quiet down in there, now. Quiet! Oh doctor, Mr. Manning is waiting for you in the treatment room. Fred Kramer will be here in any moment. - Lieutenant. - Miss Regis. Miss Regis, will you go and quiet your dog? I don't want to hear how Happy can always tell. - So it's goodbye, Mrs. Sullivan, right ? - Yes. Come on in, Phil. I'll give you that book. Let's see... I had it somewhere here. Look, why don't I drop over to your place on my way back to the hospital? Say around... - 6:30? - Great, thanks. Come on, cheer up. Now they all gonna go sometime. Yes... The trouble is that we doctors are taught that we can save lives and... the only thing you can do really is to fight a rearguard action against death. Sooner or later, we have to lose. I never thought of it that way. My father used to say... "How nice would be just once to be on the winning side." - "The winning side"? - The side of death. The object was to kill the patient. That'd be the only way you'd be reasonably sure a success. "The winning side", uh? You'd better not let your a patient hear you to talk that way. - You can be sure of that. - I see you later. We do keep meaning to have you over to dinner, Phil. Oh, it's okay. I guess your husband doesn’t like the idea we used to date - before she was married. - Oh, I know. Well, that was a long time ago. It’s funny about people you grown up with. I sometimes get the feeling that we're all still kids just pretending to be grown up. You pretending to be a cop. - Ron pretending to be a doctor. - And you? Mm... pretending to be a woman I guess. No, not you. Nobody can pretend that good, Lisa. You're nice. I'll see you. He's such a nice man. I always thought you could have done a lot worse. I did. Your tests were negative but the lab forgot to do your blood sugar. So while you're here I'll need another sample. Be my guest. You are sure you're not worried about my "M.O."? Some dread poison on a needle or something like that? No, but perhaps you’d better know about my precautions. Oh? Perhaps I should. It's my will. I've left instructions there's to be an autopsy not matter what. They're to pay particular attention to the possible presence any unusual drugs. My, my, my.... You did all that, uh? If I do have a heart attack, Ron, it'd better be a legitimate one. - Or the police will know about it. - Sure. - I can no longer safely murder you. - That's right. Then I won't murder you. I was hoping you'd say that. Er... You... got me blocked. Well, any formal social protest is better than none, right? You mind moving it? I hate booking in heroes. You're a funny cop, Phil. Like when Charlie Chaplin play Hitler. - He never. - No? Don't argue with the law. Romantic idea, murder for love. If that's what it is. Is that Lisa you want or just her inheritance? Is that the entire plot that I kill you marry her - and then kill her too? - You might. Oh, come on now, Frank, how many murders is that? Three in my past and two more on my schedule? It does seem like a lot. But we have nothing to worry about anymore, do we? We never did. Frank, would you mind if I took care of Fred Kramer first before we remove that cyst? - No, if it doesn't take too long. - Not at all. You can wait right in here. - It must be particularly hard for a doctor. - What must? Being backed into a corner. - Why particularly a doctor? - I don't know. You must all develop something of a sense of omnipotence if you don't start out with one. Scared trusting people coming here with their problems... You disposing of them with a quick scribble on your prescription pad. - You all play God a little bit, don't you? - Occupational hazard. Of course, we are called on to make life-and-death decisions sometimes. Not life-and-death really. Patients are going to die anyway. A little sooner... or a littler later, it's all you decide. That's all God himself decides. I had to have this because while there's not much danger in it anymore, I had to be sure that hepatitis doesn't show up. - It had to be from the needle, right? - Your needle, not mine. How's been going lately? Feel any impulse to give a fix? No, not since we started. Before, that was a scariest part. The... arrogant feeling that it's me... and that I have to have it. Do anything to get it, you know. That's not typical of just the addict. That attitude is not unknown of the rest of us. I’m gonna give you a larger dose of the substitute this time. It might make you a little drowsy. It might be better if you rested here while before you went home. Anything you say. - You feel anything yet? - No... Get up and move around. Do me a favor, will you? Go over and pock the fire for me a bit. Sure. It would frighten me most about getting the habit of vulnerability. An addict is like a sitting duck. - Yeah... - No! Put the poker back where you go, please. Feeling it now? Man, it's... Look, man, it's like as sharp as the real stuff you know. Yeah, it will some time. Take Fred upstairs and let him stretch out for a while, uh? Oh, sure thing. - Anybody else waiting out there for me? - Only Mrs. Manning. She's waiting for her husband. Lisa, it will be at least another hour, I'm sorry. - Why don't you come back later? - That's all right. - I did tell Frank I'd wait. - It distracts me to know that you are here, don't you understand that? - Well, I'll go if you insist. - Yes, please. Go to Mario's and have a drink. Think about us. I'm trying not to. Still upset about Mrs. Sullivan? - Never easy to lose a patient. - Sure. But you mustn't let it get you down. Yes, I suppose you're right. After all I... - I have been on the winning side before. - Of course you have. And I'll be on the winning side again. Thatta boy! - Well, that wasn't too bad. - You did survive! I want you to rest here for about 15 minutes or so. My nurse will let you know when it's time for you to go home. - You won't be here? - No, I have to get back to the hospital. You think you feel safer? Don't let me drive you away... just yet. All finished, are we? Oh, Miss Regis... Say... Get Mr. Manning a glass of water, will you please. - And see if he needs anything else. - Of course. - Resting comfortably. - And Fred's all right up stairs. This might be a good time for you to walk your dog. Oh, thanks for reminding me. - Happy doesn't forgive easily. - And when you get back, - you can send both home. - Fine. 6:30... I'll be at Phil Proctor's and then at the hospital - if you need me. - Fine. Here's Mummy coming! Well, does he want to go out? Yes, Mummy's taking now! Oh, quiet down, you now. Come on! Looking for your friend the doctor? He's gone! He's not there. You want me show you? Oh, a bloodhound you're not. Now come on, let's go. Come on, good boy! That's you, Miss Regis? No. I thought you'd left. I did but I... I forgot I had friend Fred Kramer resting up stairs and... just had to come back to let him go home. You won't forget about me, will you? No. Miss Regis will call you. Fred! Fred, it's all right, you can leave now. Everything all right? Er... I guess so. This is your coat, isn't it? You will take it easy on the way home, won't you? Sure... That'll be shorter for you to get out this way. Thanks. I hope you've given some thoughts to my suggestion. You're asking me to give up quite a lot, you know. This was my father's practice before it came to me. Before you bought it. Yes, I bought it because I had to have it. And I was prepared to do... anything... to anybody in order to get it. This isn't a confession, is it? No, just quoting a patient. By the way... You know, your theory about... that "M.O."... Business of a... criminal repeating his method? Oh? What about it? I don't think you can really count on it. - There you are. - Oh, thank you very much. - Am I late? - By two minutes. I've got a little time. Perhaps I can forward that for you. Great, come on up. I spend most of my time reading a medical dictionary. I can't keep cross-referencing terms and things... It's a little complicated for me. Come on, straight ahead. All right, Happy! Come on. Get on with it before we get soaked. That's a good boy. Come one, let's get home! We made it! Here, in you go! Come on, that's good boy. Here we go, dear, just a little while longer. That's it. Be a good boy now. See you later. Will you knock it off, Happy? We haven't even got anybody critical! Dr. Wellesley's office. Oh, hello, Meg. Oh, Gee, I'm sorry. No, this is my night at work late at the office. What's playing? Oh... That's one of those arty things they make for the kids. Whoever can understand it? I don't think the kids can either. They won't admit it, will they? No, I'm sorry. We'll have to make it another time. Okay, Meg. Bye-bye. Rise and shine, Mr. Manning. Good Lord! Mr. Manning, are you all r...? Boy! Boy! Hello? Yes, he is. Emergency. Yes? What? - What's his condition? - I just said. His head’s all bashed in. I barely get any pulse. You get a pulse? All right, I'll be right there. Someone attacked Frank Manning in my office. Oh, brother... - Get my bag where I left it, will you? - Yeah. - Where do you want the bag? - Put it right down there. - Here! Help me get him up on that table. - Yeah. - I've got blood all over you. - It won't be the first time. Okay... Doctor, Fred's gone. He wasn't here when I came back. Never mind about that. Phone for an ambulance and blood. I think it's AB Rh positive. - But you'd better check first. - Yes, doctor. I'll do it at the cop phone anyway. AB Rh positive is right. I'll see if I can give the doctor a hand. - Phil's calling... - I told you to call, now! Burt... Phil Proctor, move at doc Wellesley's. Looks like a homicide here, attempted anyway. Yeah, get an ambulance here right away and tell them we need plenty of... type AB Rh positive blood. Got that? Hold a minute. Never mind about the blood. Dead, uh? Amazing how long he hang on. He's dead now. Okay, now. When would you say you last saw Manning alive? Just before I went over to your place. If you really have to know, it was exactly 6:30 under the clock's strike. 6:30, uh? You got to my place a couple of minutes after that so you wouldn't have time to do all this. Isn't that big of you? I saw him alive after the doctor did. Why don't you say I could've killed him? - No, no, forget it. - You bet, forget it. The big question is where's Fred Kramer. Miss Regis, it's not our business to cast suspicion. It's my business, Ron. - What about Fred? - Nothing about Fred. I'll get Happy some milk. That usually quiets him down. Fred was here along with Manning, right? - He comes here every day for treatment. - He's on junk, ins't he? - Now why would you say that? - Come on, Ron! Nobody's gunning for anybody. I'm just reading what you can read for yourself. Somebody broke into your cabinet in there got a hypo and some of that dope there on the floor. - That spells junky, doesn't it? - It might. Chances are that there’s blood on him and... maybe even left his fingerprints. That's what's going nail him, not anything you say. I'm sure you won't find any blood on Fred Kramer. Fine! Great! I hope there isn't. Only he is on drugs, right? "Was" is the operative word? He's in the process of withdrawal. Okay... He was sedated shortly before I left. It's unlikely he'd commit a violent act. Is that clear? Yeah, right, sure. Burt?... Phil Proctor... Get Fred Kramer picked up right away. - Oh, come on, now! - Make it wanted for questioning in connection with a homicide. All right? Okay, Burt. - Oh, Lord. Lisa... - Phil, what's going on here? It's Frank. He's dead, Lisa. I don't believe you. Sorry but it's true. He was murdered. Murdered... - No... - Right inside there. Ron... You didn't do it, did you? No, he was with me when it happened. Oh, thank god! It's going to be all right, Lisa. It's going to be all right. Okay, he's not there. Then look someplace else. In a town of this size, you couldn't loose a midget poodle, for crying out loud, let alone a grown... I know he's a fugitive, but there's only so many places he can hide! Come on, let's get on the p... Is-is anybody here? I'll call back later. I've got something here. In here, buddy. Oh, hi, Phil. Hey, listen... Er... Here’s a question... M-maybe you can help me with it. You think a dumb cop could help you? Who said anything about that? I got that idea you weren't so crazy about cops. Oh, nobody is real crazy about cops, Phil, but... now, you-you're okay. Thanks a lot. What's the question? The question, right... Hey, how can... somebody get blood all over him, you know, without an... any cut anywhere? You know? You've got blood on you. Don't you remember what happened tonight? No... To tell you the truth... Not that much. You're high right now, aren't you? Well, it sure feels like it... But could I've got this stuff, you know? Fred, let me tell you something... You have the constitutional right to remain silent... and also have right for the services of a lawyer. Yeah... Sure, okay. Sergeant! Let's go! Now we take a ride. Maybe you'll remember something. Look, Fred... You're probably thinking: "here's a cop "who maybe resents you college kids and who wants to nail you." It's not true. I honestly don't want it to be you. Believe that please. Phil... Wha-what happened here? Somebody bashed in Frank Manning's head. He was murdered. Oh, no... Did you do it, Fred? I don't know. And why would I? But... I-I-I don't know. - Fred! - It's nothing to get excited about, Miss Regis. You're just questioning. You go on home now. All right. - Only, Phil, take it easy, will you? - You bet. Mrs. Manning's resting. We gave her a sedative. To tell you how it looks, Fred... Someone busted into the cabinet, here, got out the morphine and a needle. Manning was on the couch, surprised him. So he panicked and picked up a poker and... Whap! bashed in his head. You get it? Wh-who-whoever did it had to get blood all over him, uh? Is that the way it happened, Fred? I-is... C-could a guy do something like that an-and... You know, and not remember it? He had to forget 'cause he couldn't stand to think about it. You don't know? Come on, get off your coat and let me check your arm. They got marks alright. Come on, stop foxing around. Don't give the "I don't remember" business. Nobody could do this and not remember something. Maybe I didn't do it! I mean... I swear, Phil, I honestly swear that I wouldn't do anything... Don't swear! - Just give me some explanation... - Phil, stop it! Why are you doing this if you know this boy couldn't have killed Frank? I'm a cop, Lisa. All I'm allowed to know is evidence! Well then get better evidence. Get the real killer. - And just who is that, Lisa? - I don't know that. - How I am suppose to know that? - You see, that's just the point. I'm supposed to know it. I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Manning. Really... Why? You didn't kill him, did you? No... I-I mean, I'm sorry he's dead. Thank you, Fred. We've got fingerprints. There's blood all over him. They’re gonna match, there's no other way. The killer got morphine and this case is loaded with it. - Come on! - Do what you have to do, Phil. - You're gonna have to live with it. - Yeah, I know that. Charlie, take him and have him booked. What about you? Pick me up, I'll stay around for a while. Charlie... - Yeah? - Take this with you, its evidence. It just... Maybe it's too clear. These things just don't work out that way. All wrapped up like that! It just don't break that way. Not often they don't. Take it easy, Fred. Look, I’m not going anywhere. Hey, listen... Can't you get hold of my doctor? Yeah, I told the lieutenant. He said he'd try to get hold of him. Yeah, but did you tell him I need him? Yeah, I told him. I mean, I really need him, man. I really need him. Doctors are like what they say about us cops: "never around when you need them." Oh, yeah, right... Yeah... Sure, thanks a lot. Doctor Wellesley. Oh, yes, Phil... Fred Kramer... I suppose you have to do what you think is right. What problem? Oh, I'm sure I gave you Manning's correct blood type. But the lab people can certainly check it from the body. That certainly is odd. I'll have those clots at the lab run the test again. No... No, no, no trouble at all. Bye. Ron... - What are you doing? - Lisa! That's blood, isn't it? Just tidying up some samples that I won't need any more. Are you all right now, Lisa? Yes, I think so. Ron... Who's samples were those? Who's blood? It doesn't matter. Why, I heard what you just said on the phone. That was... Phil Proctor at the County lab. There's sort of a mix-up out there. About blood samples, wasn't it? Lisa, you shouldn't be sitting in this room at all thinking morbid thoughts. - Yes, I guess I was. - Come on. Come on. Let's go outside. The fresh air will be good for you. Okay. I don't know... I just can't help remembering how I spoke to you about it at the party, - about killing him. - Yes, - but you just joking, weren't you? - Of course I was, - you knew that. - Yes, I knew that. Ron... On the phone, what did Phil say exactly? I suppose you'll find out about it eventually anyway. They couldn't get the blood on Fred Kramer's coat to match up with your husband's. You know... I've been sitting there... Ever since they arrested that kid, I-I just couldn't believe he could do it. - Ron? - Yes? Did you have anything to do with Frank's dead? You mean, did I kill him? The mix up about the blood, what does that mean really? Most likely some lab technician got a hold of the wrong sample to test, checking it now. - It could mean something else. - What? Well, it could mean that... you made a mistake. That you put the blood on Fred Kramer's coat and that you got the wrong bottle by mistake. No, it doesn't mean that. That's good. But you poured out the blood the minute you heard. You do think I killed him, don't you? I don't know, Ron. I just don't know. My poor darling... You know more than you should. But not as much as you must if we're to go on together. We are going to go on together, are we, Lisa? Of course, darling. But we can't have this doubt standing between us, can we? Ron... Just tell me you didn't kill him. I can't tell you that... because I did kill him, Lisa. I killed him, Lisa! I killed him! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Lisa, I did it for us. Don't you understand? I did for us. Somebody in the house! Miss Regis... Oh, hi. Would you believe it, I was so upset I forget to take a sample to the lab. Well, there... There are no blood samples today. They're always blood samples. Weren't you going to do a blood sugar on Mr. Manning? Oh, I guess that doesn't make much difference now, does it? Not much. - Are you all right, doctor? - Yes-yes, I'm fine, thank you. - You're sure? - Yes, yes, just fine. Miss Regis, won't you leave those things and then... go on home and get some rest? Well... Maybe I’ll do. You know, I was wondering. How will our other patients feel about this murder? I mean, would a thing like this hurt our business? - Go home, will you, Miss Regis? - I guess you think I've wigged out, uh? You may have a point there. You know would have gotten a kick out of this? Your father. Goodnight, Miss Regis. - Have a good night. - Thank you. You too. You really killed him. That's right. That's right, Ron. We say the words but I-I just cant take the bin. Darling... Darling, we talked about miracles, didn't we? Well, miracles just don't happen. We must make them happen. I did it so we could be together, Lisa. Frank died so that we could be together. Just you and I, Lisa. Just you and I. Maybe... Maybe the three of us. Maybe you and I... and the ghost of Frank. Maybe-maybe we'll think of Fred every once in a while too. You won't be able to forget, will you? I-I don't think so, Ron. Would you tell the police what I just told you? I don't know, I haven't thought about that. That's the problem now, isn't it? Ron... Suddenly I'm afraid of you. You should be. What are you going to do? I'm sorry, Lisa, but you're going to have a heart attack. - You are going to kill me? - I have no choice, have I? None of us have really. We are all programmed one way or another. We react when you push the right buttons. You can't hope to get away with it, not two people in two days. I'll get away with it. I always have. Always? It's quite painless, Lisa. I promise you that. Just one small injection and you blackout. And that's it. No one won't believe that I had a heart attack. The grieving widow? You won't be the first to go that way. Particularly when you had a history of a bad heart. You've always said my-my heart is in fine condition! It's not what your records show. You see... the immense advantages to be a doctor, Lisa. There're several bad EKGs (Electrocardiograms) in your file. - Well, there are not mine. - They have your name on them. Ron… Am I supposed to just stay here? Let you do it? I think it's for the best, Lisa. Because if you struggle I'll just have to put you under restraints. Somebody might come by. Phil said he might come back. Phil's half hour away at the county lab. I won't take nearly that time. I'm sorry, Lisa. It's the only solution. - Why? - Self-preservation. - I must survive, Lisa. I must! - Ron... please. - Doctor Wellesley... - Help me! Help me! Please, help me! Oh, Mrs Manning! Are you all right? I'm sorry, Mr. Collins, something’s happening. It's Mrs. manning. I believe she's having a heart attack, I'll call you right back. There really isn't any help, is there? No, I-I suppose not. It'd better for both of us if you don't struggle. Yes. It will kill you quickly, you'll see. - Yes. - Come on, now... Let me have your arm. Let me have your arm. Phil! Phil! Hold right there! - Charlie, you right there? - Right here, lieutenant. Alright, give me the key, Ron... Come on! Book him, Charlie. - You were out there all that time? - Most of the time. I've called from my house. Of course, that blood on Fred Kramer's coat did match, didn't it? You know it did. You had it worked up perfect, Ron. Lisa! No! No... no. Let's go. Be sure they let Fred Kramer go. Be sure he gets to see a doctor. All right? Yeah... - Let's get out of this room. - Sure. You certainly took your time about coming in. I had to let him to make his move. Do you know he almost killed me? He didn't kill you, honey. What he did was killed her husband, remember? That's right. That's what he did, the good doctor. He did just that, didn’t he? Like the man said, he was programmed. All we had to do was push the right buttons. Like a loaded revolver just waiting to be pointed at somebody. Now you're quoting yourself. I'm entitled. It was trickier than I thought. But from the time I fed your husband all that info about Hagerstown. It worked out the way I said, right? You know something? For a dumb cop, you're pretty clever, darling. Like the man said, doll, it was for us. Wrong, baby. It was for me. You mean, without me? Definitely without you. No way, you don't think it's through. - You wouldn't? - Count on it. It's no kick for me. but you and me the rest of the way, right? You... and me... Forever. Give me the police. — Subtitles: NICHOLAS DUBREUIL —
