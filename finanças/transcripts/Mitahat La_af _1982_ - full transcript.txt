Sammy the gloves... How are you feeling? - Fine. Everything OK? - Yeah. Pull... pull... Go away, I'm climbing up. Sammy, you can't... - Shut up! Take the cart. We're screwed... Get there already... Be careful... Get up there... Put your foot over there... Get the crow-bar. Be quiet. Not so loud... Be quiet. Where are they god damn it? What's this? We blew it... I think somebody heard us. - Shut up. Fuck... Would you fuckin' shut up? Power failure... We blew it. We'll make it. Five minutes, that's it... My eyes sting Calm down, relax man. Relax! Calm down, it will be OK. The motherfucker run away... Didn't I warn you? Wow what a rat! Don't waste time, come on. Yacov! Yacov! Yacov! The motherfucker fucked us over. Hope he didn't get caught. Stinking motherfucker! We did it! We did it! We did it goddammit! We'll wallpaper walls with dollars. Look at this shithead. Not ashamed to show his face. Leave him alone. I wamed you about him. But you didn't listen. OK, quit fighting. Me fight with him? I'll waste the motherfucker You'll waste us. Forget it, the point is we made it. Hold it... Steady... What are you doing? What am I doing? Let's open the safe! We're not touching it. Are you crazy? Let's open it and take off. We made a deal. - Come on. Let's open the safe, maybe there's only papers inside? Sammy, we made a deal. We don't open it and don't split We'll leave her here. Why here? It's dangerous. Because I say so. - I don't want to take any chances. Did you see that son of a bitch? Not only did he fuck us over, he has the gall to talk. Sammy, quit arguing. Look who's talking! You showed up stinking drunk. Who is stinking drunk? - You are! Watch out or I'll fuck you Sammy! - You'll fuck me? Yeah, you. I'm not one of your German whores... Come here you motherfucker. I'll cut your balls, you asshole and fry them too. What's wrong? - Leave me alone. What's with you all, you crazy? You want to kill each other? Do it later, not now! Don't yell! - Don't you yell! You left us like dogs, and you're still fucking up. I'll settle things with you later OK, later. OK Jhana, what do you say? I don't understand the way your heads work. Simply don't understand... We mad a plan, right? The storm will pass, things will cool off. Everyone will get his share. Every guy his cut. Come on, let's hide her. What's happening here? Get to work! Rachamim, what's the matter? Get to work, nothing happened... There's nothing to see... Yacov, there's nothing to see! Get to work! You're not helping... Rachamim, what's this mess? Break up this demonstration and get back to work. Break up the demonstration, now! You heard what he said. Gentlemen, you heard, get going. I'm asking you to leave... I want a report immediately. It's not so simple, there's a lot... I don't care! Finish it and get the report out! Yes sir, we'll try. Leave him alone. What did he do to you? Come on... As of tonight, no time off. No study leaves. No sick leaves and no passes... And that's final! Police prestige is at stake here, Therefore all regional detective units will participate. Leave all other cases. All operations will concentrate on this mission only. Most probably we're dealing here with a well organized gang... relying on inside collaboration. Concerning inside collaboration, polygraph tests will be carried out on all headquarters' staff and... all related department personnel. The Inspector General promised... a reward of one million IL... for the discovery of burglars. Let me repeat - one million IL ...I don't know a thing... I have nothing to do with the case I repeat I didn't see nor hear... Maybe they shipped in foreign pros? Ain't we got enough local thieves? They are all small time hoods. Search the lighted areas, not the dark ones. Understand Goldie? No, I don't understand. My head tells me: Look down here, not in the clouds, My intuition tells me: Right here, "This is the national police headquarters building in Jaffa. Last night one of the most daring and sophisticated burglaries... ever attempted in this country took place. Burglars penetrated the building, the fortress of the police force, and stole one of the most closely guarded safes in this country. A safe containing large sums in foreign currency. Deputy commander, how do you explain the burglars'success in penetrating police HQ? We're dealing here with a gang of cunning criminals... using sophisticated means to successfully bypass... the special security measures... which were taken to safeguard such as a safe. It is plausible to assume the gang was brought in from abroad. Is there any truth behind rumors that the burglars used a crane to remove the safe from HQ? Like I said, this gang used sophisticated techniques... ... which I can't disclose as yet... But we're hoping to solve the matter very soon. Police investigators will have to pool their resources in order to... pick up the burglars' trail, and solve this strange mystery. Here at HQ everyone knows that as long as the Police do not find the burglars, who stole the safe from Police HQ, Police prestige will be at stake. Amikam Zik, reporting from Jaffa. What a blow- man, eh?! I say it's the twins from Bat-Yam. Bat-Yam twins, eh? Think those assholes could do this? Bet you the money's abroad by now. Bat-Yam twins! Man, I want to stand on a table and yell: I, Sammy did it! Alone? Well done! Oh, yeah... and Hertzel, my buddy too. I'm worried about the fact... that we haven't opened the safe yet. Maybe all it contains is paper? - Paper? What paper? Where are they? - In the lobby. I made a date with them. Robert said they're the real thing from Sweden Blond? - Yeah. One's a real blond. The other one has yellow hair. Me and Sammy are going to open a piano-bar. A cosmic piano-bar - Are you? Sammy has three bars and two restaurants in America. Famous restaurants, you know. And I'm gonna be his partner. You don't say! A real partner... And it's going to be big, five storeys... Four storeys - You said five. The municipality won't approve. OK, four. I talk with my hands? What's wrong? No hands? No hands, huh? Keep your hands in your pockets. Okay, okay, here, no hands. Look, no hands... OK, that's enough, come on. You bitch... Bloody bitch... Whore... Hey you two, quit fighting! We came here to have fun. Put some music on. Great. - Take your hands off. Take your hands off. Enough already with the hands... I said take your hands off... Leave her alone... Who you putting on, fucking bitch! What did I bring you here for? What are you the Virgin Mary? Get lost, both of you... Bitch! What does she thinks she is? Bitch! Swedish, eh? Swedish, my arse. From the youth hostel... Swedish... Swedish from the hostel... Swedish my arse. Goldie get up, take a look. Should I wake him up? Yeah... wake him up. Ben-Shoshan, get up, look. You find this interesting? - Yes Mr. Goldstein, I do. What are you waiting for? Freeze... Police... Stop. You've decided to drive us mad? I feel I am in the right direction. Well, we're lucky that you're not giving the orders around here. I assign duties here. So forget these "directions", and get to work for real. What have I been doing till now? I haven't the foggiest idea. Two weeks and I don't have a shred of evidence... and all you do is scratch your balls. What do you want with these guys? We're looking for professionals... And you're investigating junkies? Professionals... working with a crane, surmounting heavy security measures... Ben-Shoshan, file a report on him and throw him out of here! Four grams is enough to prosecute. Why release him? Because I don't have enough manpower to work on these cases now. And because I say so. Is that clear? - Can I go back to my little junkie? Go ahead, we'll see what happens. Don't forget to press charges and throw him out in the morning. Good night. - Good night. Fucking bastards, enough. Enough! That's enough. That will do... Cool it. Let him sit down. Hertzel, I'm giving you another chance What do you want, Tell me, what do you want from me? So you've got me on possession? What are all these questions? How the hell should I know? Safe? What do I know? I want to help you. Give me a lighter How can you help me, eh? I'm fucked either way. How can you help me? Tell me? How can you? We'll get you off. - What? We'll get you out of this You'll get me off, eh? My mother couldn't get me out, And you will?? Great! Give me a light You help us, we'll help you. Geulah, I can't go and stand outside the fence like a little boy and shout across the bars. Take one of your girlfriends and... just a minute. Okay, later... See you, I've got to go, I'm busy. How you doing, Ben-Shoshan? Come to sell that piece of junk? How much do you want for it? How are things? - Okay, busy, busy Trying to make a living. Yossi, two coffees. - Thanks Busy, busy, but it's not enough, eh? There's enough to go around. Let's have some coffee in the office. How are things, okay? How's the coffee? - Fine Heard you lost a lot of money playing cards? Who told you? - I have my sources. People like to gossip. With cards you win or you lose. Two million would surely help, eh? - Two million? Where am I going to find two million? What's the low-down on the safe? - What have I got to do with it? What do I know about the safe? - I don't know... maybe you heard... God forbid... I have nothing to do with it. All I do is sell cars. Yacov, think about it. Maybe later will be too late. You've got it all wrong. You know, I don't think whoever did it, is too bright. You not feeling well? - No, why? You're pale. - It's the fish I had fish in that restaurant. Yacov if you want to talk this is my number, at home too. Oh, yeah, I wanted to ask you for some advice... What do we do about Hertzel? He needs a good lawyer. Get Lidsky. Lidsky? For possession? You know how much he charges up to the trial? Did I say for possession? - Then what for? - Guess... Sammy... Sammy what's this? Sammy, open up! - Wait! Sammy! - Hold on, I'm coming. Why the chain? Did you bring salami? - Yes. - That's good. What a smile... Give me the picture. - Where is it? Give it to me... Did you get passports? He said tomorrow Yesterday he said today, and today "tomorrow"? He wants another grand. - Bastard! He knows I am pressed for time, so he takes advantage, right? I gave him the money, don't worry. - How come? Don't make a big deal out of it? Why you smoking so much? Get off my back, will you? Quit talking to me like that. Talk to your mates like that. You sit here, eat, drink, sleep. Who do you think you are? Cut the sob story, okay? What's got into you? If you don't like my face pick up your stinking socks, and get the hell out of here! I don't need parasites here! Go see who it is. Don't open the door. Look through the peep-hole. Don't open the door It's Hertzel. - Who? Hertzel? - Is he alone? Let him in... What does he want? Hi, what's up? Sammy here? - Yes Where? - What happened to you? What this? It's nothing. - What do you mean nothing? It's nothing, honest. Where is he? He's asleep. - At two o'clock? That's great... asleep... Great apartment, yours? - I wish. A real apartment... Hey, what's this? Mine's better... Sammy, want some coffee? Hey, what's happening? Great. - Nice place, eh? Terrific... How do you know I was here? My source told me. Why are you laughing? Why you being so serious? When did you get out? - Now. You sure you weren't followed? No way... how are things with you? Tum it off. - Why, it's fantastic music, new tape? Why? Why? It's new... How come they let you go? Do I know? They released Kiko too. - On coke? They prosecute for that. So how come? - Dunno They filed a report and said... see you around... Very strange... really strange. Because of the safe, they're busy. Not enough manpower, they let me go. Didn't they ask about the safe? Yeah, sort of... - What do you mean? Kind of, you know They asked me if I know who stole the safe from the police... I said, how should I know? I am too small for that. So... - What, so? I told them, me and Sammy stole the safe and took off. They said you confessed, you're an honest man, we'll let you go... What's the matter with you? - Sammy! Enough, sit over there. Sit over there... Sammy! What's with the coffee? Even they'd cut me to pieces I wouldn't grass on you. Okay, cut the crap. We've got to think ahead. What about the? Jhana wanted to open it, but I said no way! We're gonna wait for Hertzel. It didn't even make a dent. No more oxygen... - What? I just bought it... You can't trust anybody these days. You always get ripped off. This stinks. - You don't know how to work it, let me... What are you doing? - Look Let me think Sammy - No. I'll tear the cunt to pieces Hertzel, what are you doing there? Get out, you idiot! You crazy? - Watch the gate. - Okay, okay. Come on, hurry up - Get out! Man, the noise... That's enough, Sammy! In the crack... in the crack... Come on, motherfucker... A hundred, a hundred... Go and watch! - Let somebody else go. Whoever feels like leaving now, let him. What's wrong? I want to smell the money. What're you doing? - Take notes, it's from my share Burn, bum, there's piles of it. Come on, let's share it out Okay, in US currency 680,000 - Dollars? How much is that in Marks? First: 15% goes to the informant 15% out of 680,000 is 102,000 Then 25% from the remainder You made a mistake. - Why? 100% into four... equals 25% each. Divide it all into those who worked. That's a third each. What kind of talk is that, Sammy? Hey man, lay off. It's a bad joke. It's a good joke, The joke's on you. OK Sammy... we'll see... Shut up before I kick your head in! What's the matter, Sammy? Cut the crap, things are fine. I hate people who don't earn their bread We oughta... I oughta shoot his brains out. I'll give him... - Butt out Jhana! Ten per cent - Butt out. Sammy, it's only ten per cent. Come on, only ten per cent for a measly ten per cent. That's ten per cent too much Give him his ten per cent and let's go! - I'm no asshole! Nobody fucks over Sammy Ben-Tovim, in the middle of an operation and... then comes for his share. Watch it Sammy! A police car showed up, I had to... Just who do you think you are?

Yeah, you have my word. Let's say half an hour... Gate five at the stadium... You've got to make peace with Yacov. Is that why you called me? You've got to make up and give him his share. Forget it, Jhana. You're making a big mistake and we're gonna take the rap! No work, no pay! Sammy! You've got to know when to give in... That's the way I am. He's liable to go to the cops. Let him try - So you want all of us... To take the rap because of you? What's the matter with you? You've given me an idea... let me think... Really good fish, eh? You know what? Tell him Sammy is willing to share. How come the sudden change? When you started talking... I remembered the stench of Lysol... in jail, maybe you're right. You've got to know when to give in.
