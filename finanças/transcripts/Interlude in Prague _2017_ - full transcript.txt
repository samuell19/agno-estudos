Your master, I know, will understand. Is there a problem, Bloch? No, My Lord. Baron Saloka, wonderful production, don't you think? As it should be, Herr Novak. So many admirers are here to congratulate Frau Josefa on her performance. SALOKA: I see. But, Baron Saloka... Uh, what I mean is that she is... She's our shining star. Indeed. (DOOR CLOSES) Good evening, Frau Josefa. And you pay the piper, Herr Novak. Then, and only then, can you call the tune. Frau Greta. (SIGHS) Your voice was in exquisite form tonight. May I? My dear, when I find great beauty, then I want to nurture it, so that when it blossoms, I can relish and enjoy what is mine. - Baron... - Mmm... Of course, I'm grateful for... - Yes, of course. - ...such kind words, and for all your support. - (DOOR OPENS) - NOVAK: I'm sorry. Excuse me. Frau Josefa, my dear Baron Saloka, but there is quite a crowd out here. They're very insistent. My dear Frau. - (CROWD CLAMORING) - Move. Out of my way. (PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) WOMAN 1: Extraordinary talent. WOMAN 2: Oh, yes. WOMAN 1: Extraordinary. WOMAN 3: Indeed. Well, you must have heard. You know, Mozart was a child prodigy. He wrote his first opera at the age of nine. I have never heard music as exciting as Figaro. Well, he is a genius. A genius? No, I think not. A competent craftsman, perhaps. WOMAN: I believe you've met him, Baron. Indeed, I have. His Grace, the Archbishop, had the little fellow perform for our entertainment during my visit to Salzburg. Wonderful! His music is so popular. Indeed. I do believe every servant in our household can whistle Voi che sapete. - (ALL LAUGH) - Some might even sing it. (SCOFFS) Sing is a little strong, my love. (ALL LAUGHING) (MAN LAUGHING) If only we could persuade him to come to Prague, to conduct the final performance of Figaro. It would take him at least five days to get here. Hmm, and the cost. I suspect, like most composers, he can barely cover the cost of the coach fare. (ALL CHUCKLE) Then we must pay for him. (ALL CLAMORING EXCITEDLY) And here. COUNTESS MUTI: Herr Burgen. WOMAN: All right. COUNTESS MUTI: Herr Smitt. (ALL CLAMORING) - COUNTESS MUTI: Herr Luptak. - (WOMAN CHUCKLES) (CLEARS THROAT) He's a very good friend of yours, Frau Josefa. Will you ask him for us? - We would be delighted. - He can stay with us. WOMAN 1: Mozart? In Prague? - What an honor... - WOMAN 2: Bravo! (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) This will hardly get him as far as Brunn. But if it pleases Frau Josefa, I shall bring Mozart to Prague. (ALL APPLAUDING) (LIVELY PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Right. It seems The Marriage of Figaro has lost its Cherubino. What? A moment. What happened? It's from Novak. Greta has gone back to Germany and left the theatre. Any explanation? Nothing. It just says she needed to go home. For what reason? - It doesn't say. - Hmm. So, who will sing Cherubino? Zuzana Luptak. She's very talented. Has an amazing voice. And she knows the part well. MAN: It's a lot to ask of her. She's so young. Don't worry. She can do it. (SINGING OPERATICALLY) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) WOMAN: Bravo. Does she please you, My Lord? Yeah. Yeah, she does. (HORSE WHINNIES) (ZUZANA CHUCKLES) HERR LUPTAK: The role of Cherubino. FRAU LUPTAK: Baron Saloka chose her himself. Our very own darling Zuzana. (ZUZANA CHUCKLES) HERR LUPTAK: Only because you knew our darling sang like a nightingale. Oh, Papa, you always say that. HERR LUPTAK: Well, it must be true. He is a man of excellent taste. And so very handsome, don't you agree? I think he's rather fierce. Fierce? Don't be foolish, darling. In fact, he'd make an excellent husband for you. Papa, he's too old. Uh, he has maturity, it's true. What do you think, my dear? Oh, yes. Dare I dream of such a man for Zuzana. Good pedigree and wealthy, too. But, Mama, we are not poor. No, no, the Baron has already invited your mother and I to be his house guests. No doubt he'll want to talk to us about his new Cherubino. - Papa! - Hush, Dorsa. Have some respect. Your father knows what's best for you. Has he ever been wrong? - No. - HERR LUPTAK: No. FRAU LUPTAK: No. ZUZANA: Is it true Mozart is coming to stay with you? JOSEFA: Yes, it is. He arrives today. - I'll introduce you. - (CHUCKLES) Wonderful. Zuzana, I'm your friend. I'm here to help. I need to give you some important advice. - Advice? - Yes. - Is it about my singing? - No, no. It's about Baron Saloka. He'll be generous, and he will help you. Yes, I feel very blessed. In a way, yes, you are. But beware. It comes at a price. I don't understand. Just don't be alone with him. - (KNOCKING AT DOOR) - (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) Hana... Where do you think you're going? (WOMAN SINGING OPERATICALLY) (OPERATIC SINGING CONTINUES) (WOMAN CONTINUES SINGING) Bravo! Bellissimo! Encore! Sorry, did I wake you? I had no idea you could hear me. But it was wonderful. Awakened by a musical zephyr tapping on my consciousness. - Herr Mozart. - Yes. I'll be down in a moment. (GASPS) JOSEFA: Maestro! MOZART: Good morning, Josefa. JOSEFA: (KISSING) I see you two have met. - You slept well, I hope. - I did, indeed. And when I awoke, the voice of an angel came drifting in through my window. I thought myself in Heaven. JOSEFA: Barbarina, feeding the birds again? Fattening up those pigeons? What for, pigeon pie? - (DOOR CLOSES) - (MOZART CHUCKLES) And how are you, Wolfgang? MOZART: It's difficult being on my own. And how is Constanze? The loss of little Johan must still be so raw for her. For you both. Such a tiny little thing. Gone. Gone before he knew his name. At least we have Karl. Constanze is taking him with her to the spa. Good. That will revive her spirits. I miss her. Give her time. You both need to grieve. (SIGHS) Yes. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) - You're right. (CHUCKLES) - Good. So, let's talk about how you're going to spend your time here. - Peace and quiet, you said. - Yes. Really, I need time to think. My new opera is still unfinished. I'm sure you'll find inspiration here. Mmm, I'm sure I will. But more importantly, will there be a part for me? (CHUCKLES) Of course, a big, beautiful aria. - Wonderful. - Mmm. This Baron Saloka, you mentioned him in your letter. Didn't he pay to bring me to Prague? He made a generous contribution. So, he must love my music. I must thank him. What's he like? I hate him. But he'd made a diabolically wicked character for one of your operas. Oh, really? Well, I see now. Saloka, you tortured terror. (BOTH LAUGHING) (SINGING) ♪ A diabolical baritone ♪ - ♪ Or a tortured tenor ♪ - (LAUGHS) Yes, or the baritone? - The tenor. - The tenor. That'd work nicely. (BOTH LAUGHING) BLOCH: And this is the last, My Lord. SALOKA: Here. There is one more thing, sir. Yes? A letter from the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. It appears he has reason to send an envoy to Prague. Gentleman named Henry Novy. - Oh. - He requests an audience. Oh. Yes. A most important emissary. Well... Make the necessary arrangements. Yes, My Lord. Are there any other arrangements you require, My Lord? Hmm? Another visit from Frau Vogt, perhaps? Unfortunately, her husband is keeping her on a very tight rein. Perhaps your new soprano, Zuzana Luptak? No, no, no, I have long-term plans for Fraulein Luptak. In answer to your question, the wardrobe mistress at the Nostitz. Fraulein Ribber. Yes, she is pathetically receptive to a mere smile. Bring her here after tonight's performance. - Yes, My Lord. - That will be all. (DOGS BARKING IN DISTANCE) Thanks. Has anyone seen Hana? I think I'll go and find her. (DOOR CREAKS OPEN) Hana, what's wrong with you, my child? Hey. Why didn't you come down for supper? What's the matter? I'm not very hungry. - Don't worry, Papa. - (SNIFFS AND SIGHS) I'll be all right in the morning. Sleep tight. (BLOWS CANDLE OUT) (WHISPERING) Night. (DOOR CLOSES) - Mmm? - We are blessed. You'll never guess what news I have for you. Today, I received a message. No, wait. Baron Saloka? Tell me, what does it say? He requested permission to call on Zuzana. I knew it! I saw the way he looked at her. So, Cherubino isn't the only role he has in mind for Zuzana. Certainly not. And it appears, the baron is wasting no time. - FRAU LUPTAK: Aw. - (GLASS CLINKING) (EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY) Sir, have some tea. It will refresh you. The good Baron Saloka has requested the honor of your presence. A masquerade. There will be dancing. You should rest today. I can't. Please, join me. I need to talk. (BARBARINA SIGHS) I've made a significant change to my life. - Noble? - Yes. I was once the organist and composer at the court of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg. - Very grand. - No, it wasn't. - I was just one of his servants. - Really? Yes. And that... Well, that was just the beginning. As time went on, his treatment, his accusations against me... Well, they became intolerable. (PLAYING FAST TUNE) I spent my time writing music he prescribed. Court music. Barely a melody. (MUSIC STOPS) So what did you do? (PLAYING INTENSELY) I left him. At least now I'm free to write and create my own music. Yes, sir, you are. If you have need of anything, just ring the bell and I will come. You mentioned dancing? Come on, I need to practice. - No, sir. - Rubbish. - Come on. (HUMMING A TUNE) - (BARBARINA LAUGHS) (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) - (ALL APPLAUDING) - (MAN CLEARS THROAT) (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (ALL APPLAUDING) (MOZART CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) - (MOZART LAUGHS) - (ALL APPLAUDING) (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) (LAUGHING) (LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING) Herr Mozart. My pleasure, Frau Rose. But there is one problem. This is a masquerade. You're not meant to recognize me. But you're everyone's favorite. Even my father's groom hums your tunes in the stable. But it is known that horses do love my music. - Maestro, I didn't mean... - WOMAN: Enough! SALOKA: Madam, I'm not a stranger. WOMAN: I don't think so. (CHUCKLES) I'm teasing you. It's irresistible. What I'm trying to say is I believe your music is, well... A gift from God. It makes the world a more beautiful place. Why, thank you. Such generous praise. My apologies, sir. Fraulein Rose. Herr, uh, Cat. Forgive me. (LAUGHING) Well, I hope you've enjoyed the good baron's hospitality. Thank you. Yes. Enchanting. As is your friend, Frau Rose. I'd like to see what's underneath that mask. - You are a naughty man. - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I see the Baron is buzzing around our little Rose. He's coming our way. I must thank him. Introduce me. Baron Saloka, may I present Herr Mozart. Good evening, Baron Saloka, I believe... Hmm. (CHUCKLES) (PLAYING TUNE) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) So how goes the onslaught this morning, Maestro? Not well. I can't concentrate since Josefa introduced me to our new Cherubino. - Fraulein Zuzana Luptak. - Yes. I'm incapable of doing anything until I hear her sing. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Josefa told me. Barbarina, tell me about this Baron Saloka. (EXHALES) But it's just gossip, sir. You must know. Come on, sit here. It's important. Well, there are rumors. Ladies, some married. Surely society wives are allowed a little... (CHUCKLES) Anyway, if a wife puts her mind to it, her husband won't suspect a thing. Unless her throat is bruised. Bruises? I see. - No Casanova then. - No. (SINGING OPERATICALLY) MAN: Wonderful, Frau Zuzana. Let's stop there. (ALL APPLAUDING) Absolutely marvelous. Thank you so much. Perhaps you've not heard, Herr Mozart, his lordship had a narrow escape. - Really? - Yes. He was attacked by his own servant. Had to cut him down, I understand, in self-defense. Mercifully, the good Baron is an excellent swordsman. He was unharmed. Does this sort of thing always happen in Prague? Perhaps this is not a topic for now. Herr Novak, Herr Mozart. I do beg your pardon, ladies, I wasn't thinking. I must go and speak to the Baron before he leaves. - Your servant. - Yes, indeed. Please give him our best wishes. I hear you are writing a new opera, Herr Mozart. Yes, it is beginning to take shape at last. (CHUCKLES) And Signor Bondini has arranged for the premiere to take place here. Such an honor for the city. You must think it's a provincial backwater - compared to Vienna. - What you mean? Prague contains all the people in the world that love my music. Yes, you're quite a favorite. Does your new opera have a name? No, but it will be based roughly on the story of Don Juan. Always a popular subject. Can I be of some help perhaps? Sing some of the new work. I would be honored to do so. What a good idea. That would be wonderful. As long as you would allow it, of course, Frau Luptak. (SIGHS) I don't see why not. I know, Zuzana would enjoy it. - Would you not, darling? - Yes, Mama, I would. Well, yes. Please do come. Herr Mozart. To your very good health. And you, Baron Saloka. I'm here as envoy of the Prince Archbishop. Hmm. But it is not just matters of church, which concern his grace. He had heard news of Herr Mozart, that he's composing a new opera here in the city. Yes, he makes no secret of it, declares it to be a major work. Modesty was never one of his qualities. No. Aside from writing what is admittedly fine music, I can detect no beneficial qualities in him at all. His Grace would agree with you to leave the Archbishop's employ in such fashion, is insolent and ungrateful. I could not agree more. Mozart is out of control. His Grace believes he should be denounced as a heretic. (CHUCKLES) Heretic. Believe me, Herr Novy, Prague influentials are so enthralled by him they simply would not stand for it. He is bereft of social graces, and on top of that. He flirts outrageously with an innocent young woman in whom I have a professional interest. A fine soprano of the Nostitz. And him a married man. Oh. Yes. If the little upstart were seen to be without honor, then I would be forced to withdraw my patronage and then Herr Novak would have to ban his operas at the Nostitz. You would do that? I would. It would be satisfying. Oh, yes. Very satisfying. So how would you suggest we begin? First step, renew my acquaintance with the loathsome little peacock. Hmm. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Fraulein Luptak is here on her own. Are you expecting her? Am I too early? If you are not ready, I will go away then. No, no, no. It's fine. I have a piece here ready and waiting. It's here somewhere. Thank you, Barbarina. Some refreshments, please? Don't mind Barbarina. She's just jealous. I have that effect on all the ladies. (MOZART AND Zuzana CHUCKLE) That's better. (CHUCKLES) You have the most beautiful smile. I hope you should like my voice, too. Yes, of course. I'm sure I will. Now, let's exercise that voice. (VOCALIZING) Again. (ZUZANA VOCALIZING) (CLEARS THROAT) - (RINGS BELL) - (CLEARS THROAT) It works. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (EXHALES) Coming here without her mama, and Frau Josefa away. (SIGHS) (SINGING OPERATICALLY) (CLEARS THROAT) Was that wrong? No, no, it's just, um... Your papa has been murdered. Your heart is full of anger. - You have been seduced... - By Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni is a wicked man. He must be punished. Yes, but, oh, shame on your heart. You enjoy the seduction. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Thank you, Barbarina. We will help ourselves. I think I must teach you how to flirt. I think you must not. It could be helpful. I've had a strict upbringing, Maestro. Dalliance, especially with a married man is forbidden. Naturally. Will this hinder my progress in opera. What? No. You must forgive me. I was teasing you. "Oh, Constanze, "I miss you "so much. "I long to see "your dear face..." "My darling wife. "I hope your rest in the spa has revived your spirits. "I'm busy rehearsing at the Nostitz "for the final gala performance of Figaro." Just here and here. That's a forte. And here, let is grow a little. Do you understand? Yes. Yes, of course. Good. "I'm being inspired by Prague "and have discovered "a beautiful young soprano, "Fraulein Zuzana Luptak. "I've decided to call my new opera Don Giovanni, "and I believe it could be finished very soon "if you were by my side. "Please "come and join me... "Join me in Prague. "Your devoted, and ever loving husband, "Wolfgang." Mmm. (SINGING OPERATICALLY) May I make a suggestion. Perhaps there could be a question floated at the end. Like this. (SINGING) Forgive me. I know I'm just a beginner. (MOZART PLAYS HARPSICHORD) NOVAK: His lordship had a narrow escape. He was attacked by his own servant. Had to cut him down, I understand. Mercifully, the good Baron is an excellent swordsman. He was unharmed. (APPLAUDING) I don't normally get approval from my entire audience. Apologies, ladies. My head is full of dangerous thoughts. Don Giovanni is beginning to frighten me. Marriage to Fraulein Luptak. Is the proposition really so absurd? No, My Lord. She will remain in this house until she is breeding and then she'll go to one other of the estates. In the interim, I will be requiring you to run a second. So that is within your capabilities, isn't it? - Yes, My Lord. - Good. Have Fraulein Ribber visit Frau Josefa tomorrow. - Yes, My Lord. - And afterwards, I have a mind to see if she enjoys playing an unusual game My Lord. Wardrobe mistress as performed to my complete satisfaction. You will take my place. Yes, My Lord. It's your duty. One day you'll thank me for my foresight. Will I? But why am I so filled with dread and not joy? Because you don't know how to direct your thoughts. No young woman does. That's why I, as your father, must direct you. But I don't like him. There are such rumors. (SNIFFLES) He is not a good person. What rumors? I've heard no such thing. I will not love him. Zuzana, you have been taught obedience - and you will do my bidding. - (SNIFFLES) He most ardently seeks your hand in marriage. The Baron will teach you how to love, how to please him. Am I not be pleased? Oh! Of course, the Baron will wish to please you, as any husband must do. So, it's been decided. Now you dry your eyes and I shall go tell your mother the good news. I shall see you at dinner. (CLEARS THROAT) (DOOR CLOSES) (ZUZANA SINGING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I'm sorry to interrupt, but Fraulein Ribber is here - Frau Josefa, to fit your dress. - Really? Oh, well, won't be long. No, no. Don't worry. Fraulein Zuzana and I will go for the second aria. (DOOR CLOSES) Finally, I have you all to myself. (GASPS) Please don't cry. I can't cope with tears. I have upset you and I apologize unreservedly. Look, I'm at arm's length. I will not kiss you again. No. You must understand I'm not crying because you kissed me. Why are you crying? My father wants me to marry Baron Saloka. Baron Saloka, that's ridiculous. He said it's a perfect match and that the union will further my career in opera. I am afraid. Let me speak with your father. You would do that for me? Yes, of course. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) Henry Novy at your service, Herr Mozart. We have met briefly in Salzburg. So let's go again. The Marriage of Figaro. What a premiere we had in Vienna. Thank you. Now you're composing a new opera? Yes. Don Giovanni. Ah. How exciting. I hear you're trying out this new work at Frau Josefa's house. Yes. Frau Josefa and Fraulein Luptak have been kind enough to assist. I wonder, would you allow me to watch you rehearse? Yes, uh, if Frau Josefa will permit it. Your Lordship. I did not think... I saw a flower seller outside. I saw this and... I thought of you. Please. (ALL APPLAUDING) MOZART: Just a short break please. Wonderful rehearsal. Herr Mozart. I'd like you to hear a new piece. It's an aria from my new opera, accompanied by your excellent orchestra. Herr Mozart. But I'm not sure I should. Yes, Yes, you should. I have copies of the music right here. Hmm? - Very well, Herr Mozart. - Thank you very much. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) Ah. Oh. (BREATHES HEAVILY) (WHISPERS) Did I do this to you... - Mmm? - Yes. Will you forgive me? Hmm? I... I forgive you. (MOANING) (WHIMPERS) (ALL APPLAUDING) Herr Mozart. We have been truly privileged today. Thank you, Johan. Means a great deal to me. May I ask a favor of you? Herr Mozart? Please. Wolfgang. (CHUCKLES) Wolfgang. If I'm able to oblige in any way, you only have to ask. I need to try and have an audience with Herr Luptak. Have you heard of his daughter's betrothal? To the good Baron. Yes, of course. It's the talk of the city. Naturally, we are very happy for them both. And you are aware of his reputation. Wolfgang, he is our principal patron. I know that. But for Herr Luptak to marry his daughter off to such a man will... I want to try and persuade him against the match. But Herr Luptak is thrilled. I have to try. Very well. But be careful. (OPERA MUSIC PLAYING) Bravo! That was wonderful. I think we all deserve to take a break. - Don't you, Maestro? - Of course. You must all forgive me. I'm a slave driver. Zuzana and I are enjoying ourselves. Aren't we? - Zuzana? - Oh, yes. I had no idea opera was such hard work. I'll be more appreciative in future. ZUZANA: It is hard work, yes. But it is a privilege to sing Herr Mozart's music. Yes, I'm beginning to understand. You must all forgive me, um... I think I need a breath of fresh air. Please excuse me. (CHUCKLES) I need more time with you. Alone. (SIGHS) How can we? When? Pay me visit on Wednesday at 11:00. I will arrange everything. You sure? But try not to bring him with you. (BOTH CHUCKLE) NOVY: To the casual observer, they were merely taking a moment's respite from the intensity of the music. But it was clear to me that, well, there was more to it. SALOKA: Hmm. As I suspected. I've arranged for my man to follow the peacock wherever he goes. Good. Bloch. Could you arrange for one of our most reliable men to follow Fraulein Luptak also? - My Lord. - Good. Oh, and the uh... The wardrobe mistress. Go and see her. Let her know when she has to pay Fraulein Luptak a visit. Yes, my Lord. The woman works at the Nostitz. And she is also under my, uh, employ. Excellent. She will have the necessary excuses to gain entrance to Fraulein Zuzana's bedchamber. Indeed. Off you go. Mozart will make a mistake, - go too far. - Yes. He must be exposed. Ruined. We still have to find tangible proof. - We will get it. - Hmm. (BELL TOLLING) HERR LUPTAK: Please, Herr Bohac, be seated. Excuse me, Herr Luptak. I'll wait outside. Maestro Mozart has requested a word with you in private. Right. Yes, of course. Herr Luptak, I admire your daughter's voice. She has a great future as a singer ahead of her. I've already written a part for her in my new opera. Oh, we're grateful that her talent has been even the slightest inspiration to you. Oh, it has. And for that reason, I ask you to forgive me. (CLEARS THROAT) Herr Luptak, my intentions are honorable but I fear I'm about to intrude in your private affairs. My private affairs? I'm concerned for Fraulein Zuzana. Concerned? In what way? About her proposed betrothal to Baron Saloka. Are you aware of his... I'm aware, sir, that this is none of your business. - His... - His reputation as a womanizer. (SCOFFS) You dare to question my choice of husband for my daughter? Baron Saloka comes from one of Prague's oldest and most noble families. I do not question the Saloka pedigree, merely the character of the current baron. Sir, I truly believe that I can be of greater assistance in furthering your daughter's career than such a man. How can you compare your influence to that of the Baron? Hmm? You are an impecunious composer. The baron is a respected patron of the opera, and has the means necessary to promote my daughter's career. I thank you to take your leave. (SIGHS) Sir, I do not wish to cause you any anger. - Hans, show him out. - Only to warn you... Now, please, Herr Mozart. At least you tried, Maestro. Please don't tell anyone I said this, but I fear Saloka is untouchable. He thinks himself above the law. Thank you, Johan. You certainly know how to raise a fellow's spirits. Should I bring the sapphires? We do need to make an impression. No, no, no. There's no need to outdo our host, is there? But I've only packed five hats and three walking dresses. Mama, you will be fine. We're going away for two days. Two days, not two weeks. Zuzana, remember, do not receive any visitors while we're away, yes? I've already said, Papa, I understand. No dallying this evening. No dallying. Ah. Right. Now then. - (CHUCKLES) - Bye-bye, darling. There's no need to worry. HERR LUPTAK: No need to worry. She doesn't want me to say that, does she? (NEIGHING) (KNOCKING) - Morning. - Good morning, sir. - I'm sorry, but... - That's all right, Hans. Please show Herr Mozart in. Herr and Frau Luptak are not here. And neither is Herr Mozart. Hmm. Fraulein Luptak. Herr Mozart is... Not here Thank you, Hans. May I speak to you, Fraulein Luptak? Of course. Please take a seat, Maestro. (SNICKERS) Forgive me, Fraulein, but the master, he instructed me that you were not to receive anyone. He instructed me, too. And I told him I understood. I did not agree to obey. - But Herr Mozart... - Herr Mozart is not "anyone." Fraulein Luptak... Stop worrying, Hans. Is everything all right with your servant? Everything is perfect now that you are here. My dear Zuzana, I'm sorry that I have failed you miserably. He became very angry when I mentioned Saloka's reputation. He called me an impecunious composer. Oh, dear. I'm sorry. I want so much to help you. Well, thank you for trying. There must be something I can do. Oh, there is. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Fraulein Ribber is here. She's anxious to fit your costume. Send it to my dressing room. Is it usual for your wardrobe mistress to come to the house? Not really, and nothing seems very usual at the moment. I'll be as quick as I can. (DOOR CLOSES) (EXHALES) (PLAYING TUNE) Frau Ribber. (EXCLAIMS NERVOUSLY) I'm sorry. I was listening... You startled me. And you me. It's the aria from Herr Mozart's new opera, is it not? The one Frau Josefa sang at the Nostitz. Yes. Herr Mozart very kindly gave me a copy of the score. Hmm. And one of my servants is learning the piece so that I can sing the aria for pleasure. Unusual to have such a talented servant. (LAUGHS) Yes. Who is all this for? Fraulein Zuzana and Herr Mozart. But they are doing the rehearsal at three o'clock. For after the rehearsal. This is her one moment of happiness. Are you mad? If Saloka ever found out... But he won't. I wouldn't be so sure. You'd better tell the genius to cut that racket. MOZART: Halt. I'll get out here. ZUZANA: No, don't go. Not yet. (SIGHS) I must. But tonight. You'll come back to me tonight. Yes. (CHUCKLES) - Whoa! - (NEIGHING) MOZART: Hey, Johan. Please forgive me, but I have another favor to ask. Go on. This might sound melodramatic, but I suspect that I'm being watched. Everywhere I go, either Herr Novy or his servant is two steps behind me. I have seen Herr Novy in the company of the Baron, so I think I can guess what this is about. - You can? - Of course. My dear fellow, Fraulein Zuzana. Hmm. They're playing a dangerous game here, Maestro. I hope you know what you're doing. Me, too. And that's why I need your help. Come. NOVY: So now they've traveled to the theater together alone. Such brazen deceit. A pity your wardrobe mistress could not have got word to my man sooner. A pity your man could not spot Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart arriving at the Luptaks' house in the first place. (SINGING OPERATICALLY) I am so looking forward to our evening together. Me too. Be gentle with me. Don't worry. We'll get proof tonight. Yes. We will. - MAN: Good night, Herr Mozart. - Good night. (GIGGLES) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (KNOCKING) MARIA: Fraulein Zuzana! That woman Ribber's here. Quickly. Five minutes, Maria. (STAMMERS) Then... then show her to my dressing room. - Get up! - (GRUNTS) (THUDS) (GROANS) (OBJECTS CLATTERING) Don't make a sound! I know. I'll be as quiet as a mouse. (CHUCKLES) And when the dressing room door shuts, I will tiptoe down the stairs and scurry away. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (GROANS) (BOTH LAUGH) Is this how it's always going to be for us? What? I thought you understood. Making love to you was wonderful. A happiness I will always remember, but... What are you saying? I have to be a dutiful daughter. And an obedient wife. And you, a good husband and father. MARIA: Please, Fraulein, you must hurry. Mozart is a cunning weasel. Out, both of you. Yes? Our men wasted a good hour chasing some impostor down every damn street of Prague. Why am I not in the least bit surprised? With little doubt, they are, well... Lovers, but there's no proof. But there is no doubt. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) WOMAN: He's very kind. Maestro, what is it? Zuzana. I'm not sure I can do this. Wolfgang, my dear friend, everyone is here to see you. - I can't. - Yes, you can. Do it for her. The orchestra is ready and waiting. Come. (ALL APPLAUDING) (MUSIC BEGINS) (WOMAN SINGING OPERATICALLY) What do you make of my new Cherubino? Quite the find, isn't she? Hmm. Certainly is. - She's in sparkling form. - Yes. Pity she isn't as pure as her voice. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Make some excuse to get rid of Herr Novy. And have my coach brought around to the stage door. I have some unfinished business to attend to. - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Come in, mama. (DOOR OPENS) Ah... Haven't you blossomed? I'm so very proud of you. Of me, My Lord, or of my voice? Come. I am to escort you home in my carriage. Oh, I thought mama and papa... Oh, no, no, no. It-it's all been arranged. The carriage awaits at the stage door. Please. Come. Baron. (ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) - Wolfgang? - Excuse me. It seems Baron Saloka is escorting Frau Cherubino home tonight. Are you sure? But her parents are still here. I just saw them leave in the direction of the stage door. Leave it, Wolfgang. If Herr Luptak approves of them being along together, there's nothing you can do. Where are we going? SALOKA: We're going to my residence. And my father agreed to this? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. COACHMAN: Hold that. Giddy. Come. Sit here. We have not had the opportunity to speak privately together before now. No, My Lord. There has been little time. Yes. It appears your every waking hour is swallowed up by your opera duty. We are required to rehearse almost daily. Oh, almost daily. Is that so? Hmm. Come. Drink your wine. I would rather not. Well, I would rather you did. You see... Although, we are not yet formerly betrothed, I am intent on you learning a lesson tonight. When I say drink, you drink. (GAGGING) (COUGHING) When I say stop, then you stop. I believe I told you to sit. So sit! Now... It has come to my attention that you and Mozart are lovers. Is it true? Zuzana, my dear, answer the question. - You have not learned... - (WHIMPERS) ...your lesson. - Have you? - No. When I ask you a question, I expect a reply the moment... (CRYING) ...I ask it. And not at your pleasure! (BOTH GRUNTING) (CRYING) You have his stench on you. How dare you? How dare you? You humiliated me. You disgraced me. (CRYING) Your father, he won't forgive you, he will despise you when he finds out the truth! (SALOKA GROANS) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) - Oh, my God. - HERR LUPTAK: Open the door... Get out of my way. Where is my daughter? She should not be here with you at the night. I did not give permission. (HERR LUPTAK GASPS) It was an accident. I... I-I did not intend it. (HERR LUPTAK CRYING) I-I lost control. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR CLOSES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS) WOMAN: Herr Mozart, Herr Luptak is here to see you. - Herr Luptak... - Mozart. I have to beg for your forgiveness. But it is I who should beg for your forgiveness. No. No. She's dead. It's my fault. I was blind. You warned me about that monster. And I ignored you. I was blinded too. I was intoxicated by her beauty and talent. You made her happy. (BOTH SNIFFLING) I thank you for that. Good day to you. What of Saloka? (SOBS) Claims it was an accident. He won't get away with it. I'll see him hanged. (DOOR CLOSES) (WHISPERS) I'll never leave you again. HERR LUPTAK: The role of Cherubino. FRAU LUPTAK: Baron Saloka chose her himself. HERR LUPTAK: ...because you, my darling, sang like a nightingale. Herr Luptak, I have a young woman here. She's called Hana, a servant of Saloka. She has something vital to tell you. Vital. Well... Show her in. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Please t-take a seat, Hana. Hans, uh, bring a dish of tea. And some of Maria's biscuits. (DOOR CLOSES) Maria bakes lovely biscuits. Begging your pardon, sir. I'm sorry to bother you at this time, sir. But it's to do with Baron Saloka. I was in his service, sir. I'm carrying his child. He is the devil, sir. He murdered my father in cold blood. I saw it.

Stop. - (GASPS) Maestro? (MAN CLEARS THROAT) But Frau Mozart, we are less than 24 hours - before the first performance. - I know. We cannot postpone the opening again. Don't worry. I promise we'll open tomorrow. He can do it. Trust me. Mmm. (CLEARS THROAT) (OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING) BOHAC: Gentlemen, the overture. Careful, the ink is still wet. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) Take a look. (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (COACH RATTLING) You're going straight into it. No rehearsal. Any questions? (ALL MURMURING INDISTINCTLY) You can do it, Bohemia's finest. (ALL APPLAUDING) (ALL CHEERING) (MOZART CLEARS THROAT) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC CONTINUES) I thought there was no overture. There wasn't. Extraordinary.
