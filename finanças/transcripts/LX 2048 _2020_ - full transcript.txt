[??] So, we got the results back. And...? You're on Premium 3. You have an alternative here that most people nowadays do not. Am I dying? -If I am, just-- -You're not dying. Yet. Your heart is definitely failing though. You can be saved with the right donor, but time is your biggest enemy. And accidents are so rare these days. -What about a clone organ? -When you're dead, you'll be eligible for a total upgrade. Look, there are no short cuts. Premium 3 is technically there to protect your spouse, to make sure she's not left alone with a burden of raising three kids. It's not there to benefit you, per se. [SIGHS] I suppose your wife could put in a request for you. It's uncommon, but State might approve under the circumstances. Well, we're kind of separated, so... It says here... you're still married. We just never completed the paperwork. Got it. Look, my wife insisted on doing everything virtually. I feel there are still some things that you have to live through in the real world. Like being told that your heart is failing. [SIGHS] Exactly. You're a clone, aren't you? You asked for a day meeting. I'm sure you can guess the answer. Do you ever go out there and look at the sun with you own eyes? I mean, it doesn't burn your kind, right? [??] It's called augmented pigmentation. One of the many advantages of the cloning process, but don't envy me. There are limitations beyond the Premium 3 cases. I am going to book you a meeting with a therapist. I think it would do you good in these trying times. [SENSOR BEEPS] Virtual? Nighttime or daytime? [LOCK BEEPS AND SECURES] [??] ADAM: Can we please meet in the real world? Okay, well, can I come to the house then? Can I come over? Please?! Please, I need to see you and the kids! It's important! Jesus Christ, can you forget about the goddamn papers for one fucking minute?! [GRUNTS] I'm dying, Reena, all right. I am dying. That's what I'm so upset about. Is that a good enough reason? [DRY CHUCKLE] You hope I sign the papers beforehand? That's what you have to say to me? For Christ sakes... No, don't say sorry. What does that even mean? I'm the father of your children, and I just told you that I am dying, and all you care about is some papers? Fuck you! You know, I can't believe I ever loved you. [BEEPS OFF] FEMALE DEEJAY [OVER RADIO]: All you early risers, day creatures, noon lizards, people of the sun, the few and far between still holding onto the days, still believing in the light, this song is for you. And be careful out there, sunburn cutoff is 7:22 p.m. and toxic level drop off is 8:05. Thank God for Lithium X. [IAN RICHTER'S "FIVE STAR MAN" PLAYING OVER RADIO] ? The walk of a leopard In the midnight sun ? ? So they're under the radar Like a B-21 ? ? Kill their instincts Out of vampire bats ? ? Now we're pushin' out The haters ? ? And the copycats ? ? Well, why's that? ? ? 'Cause I'm a five star man ? ? I'm a five star man ? ? I'm a five star man I'm a five star man ? ? I'm a five star man I'm a five star man ? ? Catch me if you can 'Cause I'm a five star man ? ? So come on ? ? It's all right ? ? You hate my way But you love my flair, unh ? Yeah, it works. It's the best roam tracker I've ever seen. I don't know how you guys did it. Dental records, huh? Clever. Well, look, guys, not to knock the wind out of your sails, but VR technology is yesterday's news. Everything's going CHIP now. Simple installation, and bye bye, goggles. Heh, I mean, sooner or later, I'm gonna be out of a job. [WHIRRS] [BLINDS CLATTER] [VACUUM WHIRRING] Hello. -[LIQUID SPILLS] -Ah! Shit! [GROANS] Ah, shit! ADAM: They say that it operates directly, right into the brain-- no goggles, no avatars, no world building. Heh. It's kind of like a self-controlled dream, I suppose. Look, you hired me to be your eyes and ears here, hopefully not just because I'm always available to you in daytime. Thank you, I'm not fishing for compliments. What I'm trying to tell you is that what I see in here is that CHIP is taking over. We need to stop investing in VR tech. We need to focus all our resources and energy into developments for CHIP. Are you not listening to what I'm saying? I'm trying to save your company! VR tech is expensive and hard to come by, and all your buyers are going under anyhow because there's so much free content all over the realm. Did you just ask me about my meds? [SCOFFS] Is that a joke? I'm here, working for you in the real world, sitting in an actual office, ready to kick ass, and where are you? Sniffing pristine in bed while getting a blow job from your avatar girlfriend? No, I won't calm down. We're going under! We need to get ahead of the market and we need to do it now! [ELEVATOR BELL RINGS] Can I help you? I... have a day meeting with Dr. Maple. Yeah. Adam Bird. I see it. Thumbprint and iris. Clear. All right. I'm gonna open the door and let you in to the screening area. I want you to remove the hazmat suit, and take your place on the mark. [DOOR BUZZES OPEN] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] Carrying any weapons? Pepper spray? Taser? Shocker? Might want to consider it if you're gonna be roaming around daytime. Arms up. [LIGHTS WHINING] Okay, you're clear. She's expecting you. [DOOR BUZZES OPEN] So I see you were referred to us by Dr. Rhys? ADAM: Yep. She's a good doctor. ADAM: I'll take your word for it. You don't think that? I would if she cured me. You seem quite frustrated. I'm dying. That's certainly unfortunate. You want to tell me more? I wake up in the morning, I go out there-- no one else does any more, but I do-- I go out, I see the decay. I see the blazing sun. I take the stairs up to my office, but the only other ones there are the clones. No, no offense. None taken. What do you have against clones? We're not robots, you know. We're all biologically reconstructed. Just can't relate emotionally to you people. Are you afraid to die? All normal people are afraid to die. You're afraid to die because it comes with something like a grade for your achievements in life, or lack thereof? Yeah, something like that. You surprised I understand you, me being a clone and all? No. Your kind is very perceptive. But...? Something's missing. When I look in your eyes, I see reason, wisdom, but no instinct or compassion. All predestined thoughts, computer-like. You want me to surprise you. [SCOFFS] Isn't that what life is all about? [??] [WHIRRS AND BEEPS] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] -MAN: Brenda? -BRENDA: Hi! -BRENDA: You're off early! -MAN: Hey, look at you! MAN: Yeah, I had an early meeting. [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN: Have a nice night. Honey? [SIGHS] [RACQUET STRIKING TENNIS BALL, SOUNDS OF FANS CHEERING] Die, motherfucker! -[MUTED GUNSHOT SOUNDS] -Die, die, die, die! Die, motherfucker! Die, die, die, die! [SMALL WAVES CRASHING] [MOANING] [MOANING INCREASES] [LOUD MOANING] [CLIMAXING] [GASPS] ADAM: Reena, I am so sorry that you had to see that. I... I used to lock the door, but nobody ever comes in anymore. I was sitting there on a beach, and then all of a sudden, I just hear this huffing and puffing and grunting! And thank God the kids are connected, they should have to hear their father wailing like some wild fucking animal! I'm sorry, Reena. I... I... I don't know what else to say. At least I have to reassure you that our kids do not see or hear anything anymore. [DRY CHUCKLE] God, you just hate us all, don't you? How can you say that? [SOBBING] REENA: How long has this thing been going on? I don't know. [SIGHS] A while. What is it? It's like a chat room? You meet another woman while you stick your dick in a rubber doll and she puts a dildo up her ass? Oh, come on, don't talk like that. Why, you think your boring wife can't be as dirty as some other whore in the room? It's not what you think. Well then, what is it? [LASER BUZZING] [??] [CHIMES] [MAN CHATTERING IN DISTANCE] [CHIMES] [WHIRRS, BEEPS] Fuck. Fuck me. [DEVICE BEEPS ON] Dial Reena. Redial Reena. Send Reena a graphic message: I'm outside your door-- if you don't answer, I'm going to break it down. [SCOFFS] What the hell are you doing here? I still have a restraining order against you. I'll call the cops and you're gonna be locked up. -Is that what you want? -No. I want to talk to you. I need to talk to you. Please. No. Call me tomorrow. No-- Please, Reena. I need to talk to you, the real you. Can I-- Can I just come inside for a few minutes? No. The kids are here. Well, but that's great. I'd love to see them too. Well, they're connected and I'd rather they don't know you're here, so don't make a scene. [SIGHS] I'll put something on and come out. [DOOR CLOSES] All right, I'm here. Speak. So, um... I'm dying. Yeah. You told me. Come on, Reena. What do you want? Look, we're, uh... The house is this one and mine. We're in a lot of debt, Reena. We're still paying mortgage on both. Debt? No, we've been paying it off for years now. I've been paying it. And I have been raising our kids while you've been off doing your daytime bullshit, so don't treat me like I'm worthless. No, I'm just saying, if I go, then all these payments, who's gonna make 'em? Well, what about your insurance? Plus, we're on Premium 3, so your clone is just gonna come in and take over your job. Yeah, but see, there's, uh, there's this new thing called CHIP. Yeah, I know what CHIP is. Jenny has it. Everyone who's worth a damn has it. All of our kids' friends at school have it. No, no, don't encourage the kids with the shit. Hey, you don't get to decide anymore, okay. I don't want to hear it. My company might go under. The board, they're these rich men from Europe, old money. I tried to tell them about CHIP, I tried, but they don't want to hear it, they're all still stuck on VR. What are you trying to say? If we go under, then my job will cease to exist. And equally bad, they're won't be any company to cover the life insurance. Oh, okay, I get it. All of this is just you trying to renegotiate. [SCOFFS] That's why you wouldn't sign the papers. You're a sneaky bastard. I bet you're not even really dying, are you? No, I'm not trying to go back on our agreement. I'm worried about you and the kids, don't you see? I don't have a plan B! When I go, I want to make sure that you're all taken care of. Yeah, well, you figure it out. That's the one fucking thing that you're good at. I... I'm trying, but... [SIGHS] It would help to have a little more time. Look, I was wondering if maybe you would make a request... Forget it. You know, I just can't follow you sometimes. What is so hard to follow? If I die, my company will go under. If I have a little more time, I think I can save it. What is even wrong with you anyhow? They say my heart is failing. Like it's slowing down or something. I don't feel any pain. Heck, I don't feel anything at all, but that's what they say. [??] That's pretty ironic. Why? Because when we met, I thought for sure you were gonna be somebody. You know, you had this passion. It's like your heart was beating twice as strong as anyone I'd ever met. Can you just take your Lithium X like everybody else and figure out a solution before you go? Please. That way, you won't be going out like such a loser. [??] ADAM: Yeah, I'm looking for "Jerry Fischer"? I know it's a retirement home, I can see it. No, I understand you're all asleep, I just thought maybe some of them might get up for the sunlight? Good for the bones. No, you wouldn't know, not anymore. Look, I need to talk to him. Can I leave a message? Donald Stein has a chip on his shoulder and I want to help him remove it. Okay? Donald Stein. That's it. What happened? Hey, are you crying? I don't think I've ever seen you cry. ADAM: It's-- It's not me you're seeing, even though I wish you could see the real me somehow. What do you look like in the real world? Do you want to tell me? ADAM: I look exactly the same. -Exactly? -Down to the last detail. I love the way you look. ADAM: Heh, you're programmed to love the way I look. No, you gave me "AI freedom," remember? I can love whatever I want, whoever I want. And I love you. ADAM [SCOFFS]: What do you love about me? I love your eyes, the way you look at me. I don't think anyone else can look at me this way. ADAM: How do I look at you? Like how is the sun and the moon the mother and the whore all at once? ADAM: But not the wife. I know my place. Why wish for something you can't have? ADAM: Yeah, but why have anything? Why do we need to possess someone in order to love them? We can love three kids, but only one woman? One man? I don't really know what love is. Your dictionary says it's an "intense feeling of deep affection." If that's true then, I think I might love you. ADAM: But in order to feel truly loved, I need to know that you chose me. And in order to choose me, you'd have to be real, to have options. To be more than just my own fantasy. That's a lot of high talk, Adam. How long have you been skipping your medication? ADAM: You know, somehow, you're the only one who can ask me that without upsetting me. 'Cause I understand you better than... anyone out there. We're both trapped in a world that doesn't live up to our expectations. I want to know what it feels like to breathe real air, even if it means I have to choke first! -Calm down... -[MUFFLED SPEECH] ...or it's going to be very messy. Relax, and I'm gonna let go. Yes? [GASPS] [PANTING] -Jesus fucking Christ. -Not quite. I haven't conquered immortality yet. Who the fuck are you? How'd you get in here? You think that little fingerprint lock can stop me? [CHUCKLES] You don't even know who I am, do you? Donald Stein? Fifteen years Fifteen fucking years I stay out of the limelight, and then I get a call? Adam Bird? How in the fuck did you find me? And what the fuck do you know about CHIP? Y-y-you don't need that. I'm dying anyway. That's why I looked for you. Honestly, you've no... [SCOFFS] Get dressed. Let's take this show to the living room, shall we? [??] When I said get dressed, I was thinking more like PJs. I wanted you to take me seriously. Nothing more serious than this, my friend. Well, you better tell me a very, very good bedtime story, because of my time at life, sometimes my fingers just-- I think you invented it. CHIP. I don't know why you're hiding in some retirement home instead of about to be the richest man alive, but... You with state? Ah, fuck, I should've known. I didn't think a daytime person fit the profile, but hey... [SCOFFS] I'm not with state. What, is this a test? They watching me? I kept my mouth shut! [WHISPERS] I kept quiet. Honestly, I'm-- I'm not with state. -Then what the fuck is this? -I just-- I just-- -Huh? -I just need your help. -With what? -I have to save my company. -For what? -For-- For my family. See, and it all rests on CHIP. Who told you I invented CHIP? No one, I swear. See, uh-- Uh-- I was at my doctor's, and she reminded me about "Premium 3." Now, I didn't think anything of it at the time, but suddenly it dawned on me. Like a sign from above. You know, it all clicked. I knew I had to find you. MALE STATE CLERK: Okay, how we all doin' today? Let me first just say, congratulations to you both. Thank you. Your accomplishment is very rare these days. Accomplishment? Three kids. I mean, I'm not sure that you're aware, but we are experiencing a massive decline in population over the last few decades. You know, people aren't getting married anymore. They're barely having sex. Fewer and fewer want the responsibility or the burden or raising real children. Yeah, well, we know. My-my husband works for Tech Broker, so he's at the very forefront of the technological revolution. I wouldn't expect you, out of all people, to father three children. No, you see, for me, it's the exact opposite. Knowing the risks has made me aim much bigger, a proponent for the physical world. We love the sound of that here at State. You know, I think all those people out in the realm, they forget that they still need their physical bodies in order to experience everything that they do there. I, for one, am a true believer that nothing can replace the true sense of touch. The warmth. Of another human body. Okay, Mr....? Ryan. Dennis Ryan. With all due respect, what's this about? State is very aware of the many challenges that today's would be parents are facing, and as such, State is highly committed to ensuring that our plant survives in good order for the many future generations to come. So what, is there some kind of allowance? No. Heh. No. Nothing like that, Mrs. Bird, though our name may deceive you. We put together a program that will protect the future well being of the modern family. It's called "Premium 3." And it was designed and spearheaded by our very own chief genetic engineer. What, Donald Stein? Him and no other... You invented "Premium 3." And even before, you were right there. I mean, from the very beginning, they called you the father of human cloning. I need a drink. I'm happy to fix you one. Do you smoke? What does it look like? You know what I mean. How? I've got a guy who's got a guy. You think we--? How did you find me? They pitched me this roam tracker. It hacks every listed VR member in the Dental Association. Dental record, huh? Clever. Then it looks for virtual X-rays that match more than one identity. You may be the smartest man alive, but Jerry Fischer and Donald Stein have exactly the same cavities. Not to mention, the same dentist. [LAUGHING] [ADAM LAUGHING] Yeah... Why did you fall off the grid? I mean, they said you went mad, but judging by your paranoia, I'd say you were pushed out the door. Why don't you file that under none of your damn business, and you tell me what all this has to do with CHIP. So how exactly does it work? Well, you both fill out an application. Now, the application allows for a little bit of leeway, not too much, but the idea being to satisfy the remaining mournful spouse, there is a little leeway. What do you mean, leeway? You can tailor your insurance spouse, a bit, so that maybe they come back to you just perfect. Perfect, how? Well, I mean, that's all very subjective, but take Reena here, for example. And I'm not... I'm saying you love her. There's no doubt how much you love her, but maybe aren't there things that you might think to yourself, "What if...?" No. That's great. True love. Very rare. But if there was anything, well, now there's a little bit of leeway. [REENA CHUCKLES] You keep on saying that. I do. I do. Now, if you choose to proceed, you'll both fill out the application in complete confidence-- no one ever finds out what their other spouse may or may not wish to change, but then, again, if the unfortunate event does arrive, you'll have something to look forward to. I-- I don't know about this. Mr. Bird, your clone will still have all of your DNA. your genes, your general look, as well as most of your memories, your thoughts, your predisposition. We just left a little bit of room for improvement. How long is the eligibility for? Well, the policy will protect your entire household till the last child turns 18. Then, one would hope that your child would become less of a burden. Um, what do you mean, the entire household? The kids too? Yeah, until the age of 18. Now, of course, we wouldn't have you fill out any paperwork on them unless, God forbid, tragedy calls for it. [COMPUTER DEVICE WHIRRS] How does that concern me, or CHIP for that matter? Clones don't burn. It's called augmented pigmentation. But "augmented pigmentation" was not on the sheet. All the choices you gave us in "Premium 3" were about maximizing our human potential, things that we could train to do better, or else improve through surgery-- but there's no training, no surgery. It can teach my brain to increase pigmentation. Even if you cloned it, it wouldn't work. Not unless you added something in the process. You mean, like a CHIP that would trigger heightened reaction in your skin cells? Or else pump endorphins to your brain... so you wouldn't have to take a pill anymore? Well, you said it. [??] It all started as a military grade limb replacement program. Sure enough, everything went drone, and my department became obsolete. No more injured soldiers to fix. But then, the big heat up happened, and it created this sudden desperate need for augmented day workers, so they just diverted the whole program. They gave us permission to start resurrecting the dead. And human cloning was born. I gotta say, it really does something to a man-- creating life, out of nothing. You could just have a baby-- Yeah, but that leaves everything to chance-- what we were doing eliminated the factor of surprise. We knew exactly who we were getting-- perfect, trained, and most importantly, perfectly satisfied state personnel, workers whose sole purpose was to work solidly, brilliantly, under the blazing sun. You mean like biological robots? Mm-mm. I mean like enhanced human beings. -Enhanced? -Uh-huh. WOMAN [OVER P.A.]: Having a third child? Ask your doctor about Premium 3. Premium 3: Your family's future... REENA: Well, that was a bit funny. ADAM: I can't believe we said yes. Why? You're the one that's always so worried about our survival. Well, this isn't about survival. This is about, deep down, you wanting me to be slightly different. Why do you always have to look at things like that? Look, I wouldn't want to live without you, okay? Is that such a bad thought? So did you ask for me to come back exactly as I am? Did you? I asked you first. -You're such a hypocrite. -I'm just-- They said, "just a little leeway"? But then there are all these pages and pages and categories. How is that helpful? I thought it was interesting. It allowed me to imagine you at your best. Do I want to be better? Sure. But the person I love, I don't want them to imagine me any different. I want them to love me as I am. And that is completely relatable, of course it is. I've been there. And what I needed to cure that was a smartly constructed virtual lover. You had a virtual lover too? It's not what you think. Well then, what is it? It's just an avatar. It's not a real woman. She doesn't exist. REENA: But she does exist, right? In your mind, she exists. You think of her when you have a hard-on. Her, not me. Well, what about you? I mean, when was the last time -you even looked at me? -[SCOFFS] Have you looked at me lately? Yeah! And I see a beautiful 37-year-old woman who can easily be 10 years younger. Then I think to myself, for all this expensive skin care regimen, what's it for?! I mean, you never leave the house. It's certainly not for me. Oh, my God, you think that I have someone? Is that such a crazy idea? You're pathetic. I'm pathetic? [SCOFFS] I sacrifice everything for you, for us. You didn't sacrifice shit! You just gave up. And then you used me and the kids as an excuse. What, you think that I didn't have dreams, that all I wanted was just to be a stay-at-home mom? Wait, enlighten me, Reena. What was your big dream again? Because I don't really remember. All you ever do is dive on the realm. I don't even know if that counts as being home. That's where your kids are, asshole. You know, they don't want to play soccer or catch. I meet them there and you could've done the same if you wanted to spend time with them, instead of wasting it on this stupid realm order whore. I didn't mean to hurt you, Reena. [SCOFFS] I just needed some comfort. So... Unhappy. Have you ever considered that by going against the current, you're making yourself unhappy? Don't you think there's a reason they invented Lithium X? You, you say you hate the realm, but you choose to sleep through the night when the few people you can actually engage with are awake? Of course you're lonely. You'll never be happy until you accept the fact that there is nothing too exceptional about you. You're just average. -[SCOFFS] -But that's okay, 'cause I-I like average. Average is stable. You can count on average. Is that what you asked for if I die? The most average version of me? 'Cause I have a hard time believing that. You're fucking impossible, do you know that? Look, if you want to stay with me, you're gonna have to delete her. I want to be on the realm and I want to see you delete her. Either that, or you get yourself a good lawyer. I won't-- I won't do it. I can't. I get that you want to make me feel small, but I can't let you kill our trust. [SOBS] Kill our trust? After what you've done, you want me to trust you? That is a big laugh. Look, if we can't trust each other, then we're doomed. It doesn't matter what I do, we're doomed. How can I trust you when you won't even delete a stupid avatar -to show me that you care? -It's not about that! It's about the fact that you need the validation that you don't trust me not to do it again! -I don't trust you. -Then what's the point?! You cheated on me! I used a sex doll. Hardly cheating! There was AI avatar at the other end of that sex doll. I spend five times the amount of hours on the realm that you do-- I know how real an avatar can feel. You-you felt something for this-this thing. I mean, what do I even call it? -Maria. -Oh, what?! -That's her name. -[SCOFFS] Jesus, I don't want to know her fucking name! [SIGHS] [WHISPERS] Yeah, right. REENA: Well, we wanted to talk to you. -We wanted to tell you-- -Together. Because we wanted to tell you that even though you thought your dad was away on a long business trip, the truth is that he's actually moved out of the house. What? When? Since Mom cracked his head open. Kenny! -It's gonna be fine, Nate. -[NATE SOBBING QUIETLY] Stop crying. Tell him it's gonna be fine, Dad. Tell him you're coming back home. Your father can't tell you that, Joshua, because your father has found a new woman. [WHISPERING] No, I didn't! What are you doing? Why are you telling them that? Because it's true. Have a new girlfriend? No, no, I-- No, I don't. Look, um... Your mother and I, we just-- Just what? We don't get along anymore, not like we used to. You know, like, maybe with your friends in school. We don't go to an actually school, Dad. But-but you have-- You have friends, right? You mean realm buddies? Yeah, realm buddies. Would you guys every have a falling out? You know, like, uh, the guy who's your best buddy on the realm, but then, you just... Oh, just what? [SHARPLY] You don't connect anymore. Not like you used to. Look, what your father is trying to say is that he would be happier living alone with a rubber doll than having all of us around him. What the fuck is wrong with you? Look at your kids, Adam. You're about to lose your kids. Are they not more important to you than some stupid avatar? Do you want me to stay? I mean, you don't love me anymore-- it's so obvious that you name the worst. Can you just get out of here, please? Come here, baby. [??] So then, came the lawyers? ADAM [SNIFFS]: Yeah. She told State I was skipping my medication, and she used the rubber doll incident to get a restraining order against me, which limited my time with the kids to virtual visits only, like I was some kind of fucking pervert who is a risk to their own children. That's heavy. Here. Have another. [POURS LIQUID] So now, you're diagnosed with this heart condition, and you feel like the only way you can die in peace is to get your company ahead with some CHIP technology so you can save your job for your Premium 3 replacement? Pretty much. This may sound strange poor for me, but... I think we're all connected. Not necessarily in a religious sense. But more in terms of some... collective fate. Please consider the random nature of our creation. What if my mom had missed her train the day she met my father? Would
