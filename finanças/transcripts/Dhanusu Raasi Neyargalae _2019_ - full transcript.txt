Look, "Sky is the limit" is a proverb for you In her case, sky is literally her limit No, Anitha! I told him last night that I don't believe in marriage Did you tell him before you guys did it or after? As far as I know him, he believes too much in marriage Who'd not want to get married? Who'd not want to get married? Correct One more beer, please Make her fall in love with you and get married Then convince her to cancel her trip No way! Mars mission is my dream! Last night was a pure accident Like astrologer Thirumanandha said, the girl found me The stars and sky that united us... will keep us united forever. I believe that That's fate Don't you know I don't believe in fate? Don't you know I don't believe in fate? Vijaya... Every person we meet in life has a reason behind it So just think about it "So finally this beauty got wooed by her Prince Charming" "Also the prince fell for the beauty as well as the brains of this princess" "As the groom blushes..." "the bride reciprocates as they step together into the dream world" "None of them have any experience but then it's ok" "They are scared. Their game's over!" "He blushes and she feels shy, as they move closer" "Will their secrets spill?" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "Should we blame the booze or should we blame our desires?" "Or dear, tell me if we should blame the romantic evening?" "Should we blame the cold climate or should we blame the body that wanted to rejuvenate?" "Or dear, tell me if we should blame our discipline?" "- A part of the sin... - he committed that" "- Rest of the sin... - Again it's him" "Well, can't blame him. It's your smile that all started it" "Well, can't blame him. It's your smile that all started it" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "I can feel that something’s new. Oh my darling, it's all because of you" "Never felt like this before and I've never been so crazy" "The lips are getting dried and there is a vibe going on" "I can see from his eyes that even he has never felt like this before" "Who made the first move? Who kick started it?" "Who made the first move? Who kick started it?" "Well, no one's to be blamed since everything's over now" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" "Let's ask the people, who is at fault here?" "How about we commit the sin, one more time, dear?" Thank you, aunt - You both must visit our home sometime - Sure Anitha Ok Just a minute Go, find out what he wants What is it?

I'd have married you off now and you'd have children by now I'm being quiet, respecting the fact that you're and elder Stop irritating us! Get lost! Mom... don't you already know about the oldie? I know how much struggled to find a bride for uncle He kept pushing it giving reasons and stayed a bachelor Look, how much you've struggled to find me a bride? Thirumanadha told me that I'll get married soon Trust me, mom! Uncle... What's the rush to leave home now? - Ok, I'll drop you - Enough! Enough of you both taking care of me I can take care of myself Instead of going behind all these stars, horoscope, signs and offering prayers for them... if he had gone behind a girl, it'd have saved me the embarrassment - Mom, well... - Shut up! Embarrassing in front of everyone is all you both do! What did I do? Dear sister! I shouldn't have trusted you with my son Let me at least see off to the rickshaw. Dear sister! Damn! Acidity What is he doing here at this hour? Regretting that my sister didn't scold me enough? Regretting that my sister didn't scold me enough? Regretting that my sister didn't scold me enough? Regretting that my sister didn't scold me enough? Regretting that my sister didn't scold me enough? Dear nephew! What happened? Why do you look sad? Are you feeling bad for what my sister said? She never scolds me That's why she vented all her anger on you Listen, that old lady is like a zombie If a zombie bites a person, they'll also turn into a zombie That zombie bit my sister and my sister bit me Why don't you talk to KRV? Why don't you talk to KRV? I can see that she too loves you She might talk Saturn is bigger than Earth and Sun is bigger than Saturn But make her realize that your love is bigger than all of them I'm telling you. She is THE one for you And you are THE one for her Don't let her go! So, let's eat? Arjun, your eyes tell me that something's special Found your life partner? Almost If your check our horoscopes and give your consent... Oh! So, it has reached that stage? Fine, give it to me A notebook full of details? Please leave some work for me too! Please leave some work for me too! Whoa! Guys these days are very smart! Just like you said but not a dish from other state But a bird flying among the stars My life that always depended on horoscope, now depends on her My life that always depended on horoscope, now depends on her She's my moon! I'm lost in her thoughts and so deep in love All my past has vanished from my memory... expect those I spent with her expect those I spent with her I have really fallen in love with her What happened? You'll have an awesome married life Wish you good prosperity Thank you, sir. See you Thank you, sir. See you It's a boy thing Mother's tears And your thing... is Thirumanandha's approval is Thirumanandha's approval So... you came looking for me Viji... You are all I think about, Viji So am I! Thinking about you all the time! And that's why I'm angry with you! So am I! Thinking about you all the time! And that's why I'm angry with you! But why does it make you angry, Viji? I was not brought up like that Even my parents maintained a practical distance from me But you? You became so attached to me, more than anybody! You love me more than yourself My dad passed away when I was a child My grandpa, mom and uncle showered too much of love on me And I showed that love on you. Was that a mistake? And I showed that love on you. Was that a mistake? But your love... But your love... is something I don't want, Arjun The one way trip to Mars is something my dad believed I won't get selected for He cried when I told him about it He didn't talk to me for 4 days He didn't talk to me for 4 days He just cried But he realized He also made my mom realize But you? You don't want to let go of me But you? You don't want to let go of me You know I won't return if I go on this mission So you want to tie me down with your love and make stay here forever Of course Viji I want you to stay here and that too with me! I want you to stay here and that too with me! But I need more than that, Arjun! But I need more than that, Arjun! You don't care for me so much! You don't care for me so much! And don't look at me like that I just want to drown in that sea right away! Will you let go of me, Viji? I would have If I was the same old KRV If that's what you wanted If I hadn't lived few days with you Then how do you expect me to let go of you, Viji? If Thirumanadha has said, wouldn't you have left me? I have no words to explain you, Arjun There's nothing embarrassing than thanking you But I wanna say... But I wanna say... I'm sorry! Why are you sorry? I don't get it I kept refusing but... ended up falling in love with you Because of your little dreams... I don't want my dreams to get crushed But you're my Orange mirage The Orange mirage that blocks my Mars! The city lights that blocked the view of my destiny That's all That's all Why do you want go to that life-less place? "How can you go?" When everyone asked me that I wondered what the big deal in it Now I understand That question is a shock of those who have understood the depth of relationships Now, I'm struggling If I stay back here... Sathya mess will turn into KRV restaurant We'll have kids with whom we'd look good in a portrait We'll have kids with whom we'd look good in a portrait It will make my parents very happy But I won't be happy Whatever feels right for now will later look like a big blunder I understand Viji What do you think I can do about it? I need you! I have never been so happy in my life like those moments with you Don't you feel the same way? Neither am I able to lie... not am I able to speak the truth Our journey so far Our first meet at Bangalore The night among the stars in the ocean I fell in love with you Arjun I could not resist You think I don't understand? Don't you feel the love I have for you? Then? Our love is not a lost cause You continue to live with your astrology You continue to live with your astrology And I'll continue to live with my astronomy You are a great soul, Arjun Even when I'm at Mars, the moments with you... that's what I'll be thinking all about Come back. I'll wait for you Come back. I'll wait for you You foo.. Let your Gods save me and bring me back to this planet But even if I come back... But even if I come back... I must see you along with your family Stay back, Viji! Please! Told you! Don't talk Please Arjun! Don't cry! I don't know how to handle tears I know I made a mess! This must be our last meet Keep me in your memories forever Keep me in your memories forever Goodbye, Viji Viji? Goodbye, darling That's better And don't call me Viji... Don't say a word! What do you want? Brother Brother Please come. Please, have a seat That's ok. Please, you sit Look Look at this The last time you saw her, she was a newly wed bride. Isn't it? How happy were you for her when she got married. Isn't it? May be if I had not married off my daughter... she'd have been alive and lived with me forever as my daughter I met around 10 to 15... in fact more than that I inquired all those astrologers Everyone said... Everyone said... she'll have a blessed and successful life! Not even one of them told... that she'll die if she gets married Remember your advise? To offer prayer to the deity She did all that perfectly So all that was a lie? Everything's a lie? Everything's a big fat lie? Answer me! It's all a lie! Told them to marry after the rituals to get rid of those bad omen But your parents paid heed to nobody Ask her to offer prayers to deity Durgai amman Good news will find her the 10th week! It is only after offering this prayer... things are looking good things are looking good According to your horoscope, Jupiter is on the 1st house! Nothing to worry! According to your sign... you'll get a girl from a different state A girl with a different mother tongue Our love is not a lost cause You continue to live with your astrology And I'll continue to live with my astronomy And I'll continue to live with my astronomy A girl? What else could be the problem for youths these days? - You may take him. Careful - Thank you Careful! You might fall! She left me So astrology is a lie? Sit Wait. Let me dry your hair Sleep She left me When did you reach, mom? If you had doubts over the authenticity of astrology, you should have asked me! Look, what a clear vision that girl has at this age She is risking her life and have decided to go to Mars And she succeeded! Because she loves herself! Hats off to her! You ignore the reality and sing the same old bygone customs and traditions! You know Bill Gates? Tell me what superstitious ring he wore to become a millionaire? Caveman struggled a lot while living in forest It is for self confidence and to defeat fear they created God, astrology etc. If that itself is a threat to us then why do we need that? Doing C-Section at auspicious time Destroying and re-building a house in the name of Vasthu Does this all sound like a solution? I thought at least mocking your beliefs will slowly change you But you ended up in the police station! But you ended up in the police station! Fine, uncle! You are right! Then why didn't you get married? Because you did get rid of bad omens! Right? One slap and... My marriage is totally my call Stop talking! Rituals; my foot! Let me tell you a secret that I kept from you When you came into this world... the nurse handed you to me Except your mother and you, nothing mattered the most to me! Dear nephew, you are the world to my and my sister If you still don't mend your ways... then myself and my sister's life is a lost cause There! I said it all! There! I said it all! Now, you decide! Dear sister. I leave your son to you Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - Dear brother! - Uncle! - Dear brother! - Uncle! Uncle, wait Mom... What's the use in thinking about the past? If I had given up after your dad's loss... I couldn't have raised you I'm confused, mom Be it Viji or horoscope... learn to embrace them and learn to live without them too So, if it my fault to have trusted astrology? The mistake was to have trusted it blindly Lover marriages... Marriages made by astrologers... are now knocking the doors of the court, demanding divorce Everything is in our hands Why didn't you give me this lesson when I was running behind horoscope and astrology? Your father didn't die because he refused to do the rituals He died because of poverty He has some heart problem Today we possess a lot of money But sadly, back then we didn't As far we know, his death was sudden But... he knew it for long and died willingly Why didn't you ever tell me this? When grandpa said ignoring astrology was the reason for his death you went behind it That will affect only you But if I had told you he died because of poverty... you'd have ran behind money like everyone else That'd affect many! Cry your heart out! Your happiness is all that matters to me And to your uncle too! Engagement is done... then what's so important that you wanted to discuss? I wanted to ask you something from a long time Can I? What is it? No one agreed to marry me because I have Sevva dosham ( Mars - Bad Omen) in my horoscope But how did you... But how did you... I love Mars! That's why One more question Mom, I'm talking to him I'll call you later What's your Zodiac sign? That's time! He got hitched to a girl who believes in astrology and horoscope Now, do we believe in time or not? Whatever. I have done my job in the given call sheet I have another shoot See you! Wish you good prosperity
