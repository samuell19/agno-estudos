Welcome. - Do you have an appointment? - Yes. - Ms Uchida? - Yes. You chose your hairdresser. Mr Yoneda, your customer. I'll take your things. Excuse me. Have you been here before? Ms...? Uchida. Risa Uchida. Sorry. Have you been before? No, it's my first time. Really? I feel we must have met before. That happens to me a lot. I have a common sort of face. Not at all. Excuse me. But you asked for me by name. So I guessed you were a customer at my former salon. Sorry. That was just me being nostalgic. How do you mean? You have the same surname as my late husband. You must have loved him a lot. Yes, even though he was the worst husband! You want a lighter brown? Yes. Just a moment It's a shame, though. Your hair is beautiful I'm fed up with it. Right. I've quit my job. So I feel like a change. What did you do? How can I explain it? I went to people's homes to help them. A home help? That sort of thing. - That must be interesting. - You think so? You get to see lots of people's homes. - You get to see lots of people's heads! - That's true. - That's interesting, isn't it? - Yes. Drying now. Mum. Let's go to your room. Mum. Toko. Toko, what are you painting? Ichiko, this is no good. It's a cigarette, not a paintbrush. I don't like it! Right. If you want to smoke, let's go to your room. Come on, let me help you. Your eczema has all gone. Have you been doing the jigsaw? Gran's been doing it. I wonder if she remembers... that the painting is by her. I remember. I'm not completely gaga yet. Toko, you're good at jigsaw puzzles. I love that painting. Where did you paint it? It's like I'm carrying a baby. It brings back memories. Bringing you into the world was sheer agony Really? Toko. Are you ready for bed? Thank you. A GIRL MISSING Motoko. How's the revision going? Not so bad. Really? That's good. Ichiko, can we meet at Caf? Lumi?re this evening? This evening? Hello. Oh, you're on your way home. Are you going tonight? To Caf? Lumi?re? Can I come? I have homework to do. As long as you ask your mum first. No problem. If you're going, she'll say yes. - Not necessarily. - Yes, she will. See you later. NURSING STATION I'm back. Hello. Here, Akiyama. Thanks. Ichiko. A drink? - I really want to. - Let's go! - But... - Dr. Totsuka? The Oishi girls. I'm helping the Oishi girls revise. You never stop! - Don't overdo it. - Right. - Next week, then? - Yes, next week. Here, eat this. Thanks. Excuse me. Mr. Yoneda? Yes. You did my hair. Good morning. - You live near here? - Here. - Right. - You too? In that residence. Over there. It's nice to know someone else in the neighbourhood. Living alone is hard. Even deliverymen scare me. There's a lot of bag-snatching around here. Really? If you don't mind, could I have your phone number? Just as a precaution - There you go. - Thank you. Well... see you again. I don't know how to. It's really easy. And practical. So I hear. You always just send individual messages. You texted each of us to tell us you'd be late. - You could have done a group one. - Right. Leave her alone, Saki. I don't know why, but I don't like group chats. Writing someone a letter used to be such a personal thing. We're all different, we all deserve separate attention. - You take it too seriously. - You think so? Ichiko, can you explain this? Ichiko, do you understand this question? On the above... The straight line... The sum of the lines... They're the same. They're both the same. Are you tired? No, I'm good. You need to loosen the muscles here. Massage like this. I know. And this... What's that? Opening your mouth works too. Really? It's time! Your crammer class? Where's the toilet? At the back, on the right. OK, thanks. See you, then. - See you. Take care. - Yes! End-of-life care is about providing comfort and the environment in which... Tatsuo! Come here. This is Tatsuo, my little sister's son. Hello. You have the books? Where are you going with that big bag? Hokkaido. Really? That's nice. On your own? Yes. Thanks. Isn't there one missing? They were my sister's, they might be useful to you. Your sister's? I helped her with her studying too, but it didn't do any good. Thank you very much. I used this. - Thanks. - See you. Have a nice trip. Wait a minute. Just a sec. Turn around. Here. The little monkey! He got me there. Kento? He was giggling like an idiot this morning. I bought him a present yesterday. For his birthday. You're jumping the gun a bit. They soon sell out of the popular toys. You're quite the expert! I bought my nephew lots when he was little. Good morning. Sorry. Come on in. - She went to her crammer class? - It seems so. But after that, we don't know. I've called all her friends. Excuse me. Yes? Thanks for calling back. My younger daughter didn't come home last night. I was wondering if she might be there. I see. No, I don't think there's anything to worry about. I'm going to touch your stomach. - You can cover her up. - Right. Household electrical goods to get rid of? Televisions, air-conditioners, vacuum cleaners or fridges... We take everything, whatever the appliance, in working condition or not. In the case of the missing schoolgirl, the police are appealing for witnesses. From Nagareyama in Chiba prefecture, the girl's name is Saki Oishi. She went missing a week ago after an evening crammer class. There has been no word from her since Saki Oishi was wearing her school uniform and carrying her satchel. Why her? Would you rather it had been me? If you'll allow me... Hold on here, I've nearly finished. Toko, don't you want to listen to music today? I've lost interest in it. I could bring you some if you like. Thank you. Excuse me. I just want to listen to your lungs. It's Saki! They've found her! I'll be right back, Toko. - Good morning. - Hello. How's Saki? She seems pretty calm. As she's in good health, she'll be out tomorrow. - Out of hospital? - Yes. That's great. I have to take her some clean clothes. Do you mind? No problem. A young man of twenty has been arrested. The schoolgirl went missing earlier this month in Nagareyama, after having been to an evening crammer class The story was made public several days later. Yoko... - Are you alright? - Sorry. A suspicious vehicle was reported in Noda... The police make me sick. The way they talk, you'd think it was Saki's fault. You know that's not the case. The alleged suspect is a young unemployed man, Tatsuo Suzuki. According to the police, on the day the young girl went missing, he seized her as she left her evening class and then drove away in his car. He's being charged with abduction and false imprisonment. It would seem that since his arrest Tatsuo Suzuki has remained silent. The police want to establish... - Excuse me. - See you later. Watch the house. Yoko! Yes? I... Yes? - I... - Ichiko! Yes? I... I'm so happy she's been found. Yes. Sorry we had you worried. Tell Saki... that I'm thinking of her. Yes. You're back! Great news, isn't it? They've arrested the culprit. Mrs. Oishi must be relieved. - We should celebrate. - Good idea! - Such a relief. - Korean barbecue? Count me in! Little sis'? I'm calling about Tatsuo. Are you all right? You can tell me when I get there. - Hello. - Big sis'? I'm in front of your place. There are loads of people. Where are you? I'm sorry, but I was told I ought to go away somewhere. What do you mean? Just as they were showing Tatsuo on the news, the phone rang. It was the police. I was getting dinner ready and I totally panicked. Calm down. Just tell me, nice and calmly. The police told me that the media would show up, so I've gone to a friend's. Oh, God! The gas! I must have left the gas on. And I left the frozen food out. You're not at home, then? Can you go in for me and turn off the gas? No I can't. What if it starts a fire? - Calm down. - What am I going to do? Excuse me, can we go, please? I don't know what to do. So you don't know what Tatsuo did, any more than we do? He told me he was going to Hokkaido. I see. Call me if you hear anything else. What? Congratulations for what? Thanks. Bye. I hadn't been to a museum for ages. I'm glad your friend canceled. Really? What did you like the most? It's hard to say, but... I'm drawn to the hair. In the paintings? I wonder how they painted it. Conditioned by your job! I saw you looking at the sunflower. The sunflower? The dark painting in the last room. In fact... I even bought a postcard. Let me see. There. That's the one. I've always really admired painters. You know Van Gogh's Sunflowers? It's amazing how, depending on the artist, sunflowers can look so different. For Van Gogh they were a symbol of life. But for Mondrian, a symbol of death. Well, that's what the catalogue says! Hang on! This. - Do you know it? - It's by Toko Oishi. I'm impressed. She's not that famous. They sell this card? She's a local celebrity. Actually, she was my girlfriend's grandmother. I met her quite a few times. Wow, really? The last time was a while ago, though. She died last month. Cancer. She was bedridden and the doctors gave her two months. But she held on for nearly two years. She was compos mentis until the end. "Compos mentis"! What, isn't that right? Is it wrong? Risa. Earlier... when I was talking to Saki at the hospital, she said she never saw the culprit. And she doesn't remember seeing him at the caf?. And she doesn't know that he's a relative What? A relative of yours. So... at this point there's no need for you to get mixed up in it. I think it's best... that I tell them what I know. No. Absolutely not. But... I don't want to lie and I have to apologise. What for? You haven't done anything wrong. And... if you do talk, you'll no longer be welcome at our house. Probably. Doesn't that bother you, Ichiko? I don't want that. There you are. What's going on? My parents sent me lots of vegetables. I brought them around. I texted you to let you know. What are you doing? Sorry, I didn't see it. You're full of beans, aren't you? Dinner's ready. Race you to the table? Get stuck in, then. Let's eat. Damn it! - What? - Rain this weekend. Yes, apparently. You haven't forgotten, have you? What? We're going house hunting. Yes, I remember. You'd forgotten! Sorry. Rain makes everything awkward. When are we moving? It won't be for a while yet. I like our house. Yes, but... it's a bit small for the three of us. But there were three of us living in our house before. Yes, but... it's still small. That story. What a relief! I'd imagined the worst. It seems the suspect is still refusing to speak, despite the police's continuing efforts to question him. When arrested, the suspect was carrying a large rucksack containing clothes... Eh? Does that feel better? What's the matter? Saki. What's wrong? I don't know. Well? They've been saying things at school. What sort of things? That she got raped. She's denied it, but no one believes her. The poor thing. Also... there are loads of journalists hanging around the school, asking questions about her, as though she's the guilty party. - I really think... - No! I mean it. Don't say anything. You... didn't do anything wrong. Ichiko, is it your day off tomorrow? Yes, that's right. Reserve it for me, then. It's important to unwind. Once, a classmate came to the house. We got bored after a while and started showing each other parts of our bodies. We compared the size of our breasts. We started getting into it and decided to strip off completely. But I felt embarrassed doing it in the bedroom, so we got into the wardrobe. - The wardrobe? - Yes. With a desk lamp. We didn't do anything in particular, but... in the dark, with just that light, our curves looked beautiful, like in old paintings. We chatted quietly for a while. Then Saki came in. She was only about this big. Suddenly she opened the wardrobe door. She scared us, but she was scared too. She was shocked and started crying. She went and told Mum that we were naked. We quickly threw our clothes on. Mum didn't know how to tell us off. "What are you doing? It's still cold!" As if that was the point! That's a great story! Once, when I was little, my father brought me to the zoo. We were looking at a lion when my dad suddenly ran away. I said: "What's the matter?" But he didn't answer. So I got scared and I ran after him. "Daddy, wait!" I was running after him but he didn't stop. So, at that point, I decided that my dad had become an extraterrestrial. I swear! Once we got home, he was the same as usual, but for a long time I thought he was an extraterrestrial. He brought me up on his own. I must have been afraid that he'd end up leaving me He's not moving much. Is that... your girlfriend? Your home screen. Sort of. Lucky you! The last time I came here, that rhinoceros had an erection. It was amazing. Big? Big! Shit! Do you have any news? They say he's not talking. I don't know anything Nor my sister, and she's his mother. He's not allowed visitors. Did he really... not do anything to her? Maybe Saki doesn't dare tell us what really happened. If she was younger, she could have just gone and cried to Mum. Wow, you see that? At first... At first, I simply couldn't believe that he could have snatched a young girl. I couldn't imagine that he'd have that in him. But... he's a man. Yes, he's a man. Can I... tell you a secret? A secret? An old story. Like yours. When Tatsuo was still in primary school, probably about 9 or 10, he came to sleep at my place. His mother had a fever and was in hospital. He was a child so he was in bed before 10. I went to check on him and saw that he had an erection. I couldn't get over it. That even a boy that young would get an erection. The human body is fascinating. Out of curiosity I pulled down his trousers. This is getting dodgy! No, don't worry, I wasn't being indecent. I see lots of penises in my job. But when I pulled his trousers down Tatsuo started crying. I had a hard time calming him down. The next morning he seemed a lot better. He thought he'd dreamt it all. Damn. Sorry. What were we talking about? That... he's a man. Oh, yes. I'm sorry I told you that story. I'm weird, aren't I? No, you're not. Ichiko, you're not weird. Come on, quick! Miss Oishi, hello! So, how was the zoo? Hello. Sorry, I'm a bit early. About your sister... I'm really glad they found her. Yes, thanks. Motoko, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to go. Okay. - Shall we drop you at the station? - Yes. A patient? With Dr. Totsuka? I haven't told you, have I? He and I are engaged. What? We're going to check the venue for the reception. In you get, then. In you get. I'm good, thanks. I'll walk. Are you sure? Yes, I have some calls to make. Right. Thanks for today. Is it definite? The marriage. It's definite? If all goes well. I see. Congratulations. Thank you. Hello. Sorry to bother you. - Who is this? - My name's Yamashita, a journalist. Where did you get my number? I've received information. You wouldn't be hiding anything important, would you? I'm right, aren't I? - I... - I thought so. You're wrong. Don't call me again. Saki. Are you all right? What do you mean? After what you went through. Yes, I'm fine. I'm great! Where's Motoko? In her room, maybe. Oh, right. Victim Support Association Motoko's boyfriend left that for me. This brochure? Is it his job? No, but he brought me all sorts of literature. Yes, he seems like a nice boy. - Have you seen a photo of him? - Yes your mum showed me. I'm not surprised. She wants them to get married. Really? She's been going out with him since high school. That's quite a while. I'd hate it. At school they're all just kids. Really just kids. Ms Shirakawa. Can I have a word, please? I'll just finish this. If you don't mind. Now, please. Saki, go to your room. What? Go on. This. What's it all about? Can you explain it, please? Terror nurse! Did she arrange the abduction? - It's not true. - Explain it, please! Yes. It is a fact that... Tatsuo Suzuki is my nephew. It's true, then. I should have told you. I'm sorry. So you lured Saki? No. Not at all. I just happened to be with Saki the day I saw him. If I'd known... I trusted you. How could you hide that from me? And, above all, how dare you come back here? I'm sorry. Mum, it's all right. Be quiet! Ms Shirakawa, I want you to leave. - But Toko... - That's enough! We'll manage. Go! You've got it wrong... I'll call the police! Ichiko. I'm sorry. But it's for the best. It had to come out eventually. - Oh, hello. - Hello. You've finished early. Hello. Is this seminar compulsory? No, it's up to you. I'll go, anyway. Hello! Ms Shirakawa, are you there? Can we have a word, please? Ms Shirakawa, He's your nephew. You could have told me. I'm sorry. Well, it's done now. You know... maybe we should postpone the wedding. Why? Because... it could harm your reputation. So what? It's all part of being married. Thank you. We won't be able to move the house in time, though. For Kento's birthday. Because of you. And all because you need more cupboard space! Shall we celebrate it next week? Yes. And I'll tell Kento that you're going to be his new mummy. Thank you. Hello, this is Cocon. Ms Shirakawa isn't here at the moment. Sorry. I'm not authorized to answer your questions. Yes. Goodbye. I've got better things to do! Don't say that. Sorry. Good morning. - Sorry I'm late. - No problem. See you later! Here are your files for today. How's Saki? Fine, just lately. And your gran? No change. But sometimes, with the new nurse... she calls her Ichiko. Right. Answer it. No, it's okay. Ichiko, aren't you going home at the moment? Your replacement told me. There are still lots of journalists hanging around the building. There's a bed at Cocon. Ichiko, what if we shared a place? You and me, flatmates. I could get a part-time job to pay my share of the rent. - That'd be fun. - Wouldn't it? I'd do the cooking. - Really? - Yes. When you got home from work, it'd all be laid out on the table. A steaming pot of stew, like in a TV commercial. - It'd be great. - Wouldn't it? You could help me revise every day. So that's what you're after! When shall we do it? What? - Are you serious? - Of course. I'm sorry. It would be great, but... I'm moving soon. Exactly. No, you don't understand. How can I put this? I'm moving in with Dr Totsuka. Next month. Motoko, you should move in with your boyfriend. Unbelievable! You and Dr Totsuka. How can you get married? How can you be happy? Saki isn't at all well, you know. She's totally withdrawn. And you... all you're thinking about is yourself. And you're to blame! Sorry. I'm really sorry. No, I'm sorry. I went too far. Are you Ms Ichiko Shirakawa? Or a colleague? Are you Ichiko Shirakawa? No, I'm not. Yes. She's a nice woman. Really kind. But one day she told me that when the culprit, Tatsuo Suzuki, was little, She... amused herself by pulling his trousers down. I have to admit I thought that was a bit weird. It might have had an influence on the suspect's development. And now she's planning to get married. Does someone who's broken a family deserve a happy future? Don't you agree? Is that... true? No. She's lying. You mean that you never told her that? That's right. Can I believe you? Well, I did tell her that when my nephew was little I pulled his trousers down out of curiosity. But I didn't touch him. And it was a long time ago. He doesn't... Ms Shirakawa? What do they want with us? Excuse me, could you answer a few questions? Please. A statement? - Are you Ms Shirakawa? - Hello. I'm Ms Shirakawa. Ichiko Shirakawa. I have just now handed in my resignation at this nursing station. Henceforth, this nursing station... has no links to me or to this case. So please... leave them alone. Is the story that's been told about you true? I... have done nothing at all of which I should be ashamed. That's all I have to say. - No apology? - Had you done it before? Why did you lie? Who's your fianc?? Does he work at the hospital? Ms Shirakawa... Tell us about Tatsuo Suzuki. Ms Shirakawa! Do you like little boys? Did you abuse him? I'm really sorry about all the disturbance. Yes. Yes, as soon as possible. I'll be moving out. I'm sorry. But... what are you doing here? Ichiko... I don't... I don't know... why I said that. Ichiko, please don't hate me. Ichiko, I'm going to take the exam and follow the same path as you. And then... we'll be able to... Who's that? Is it Shirakawa? It's Shirakawa! Kento. Here. Your birthday present. But it's not my birthday yet. Yes, it's a bit early, but that's all right. Thank you. You're a good boy. Promise me you'll do what your daddy tells you. Good. Bye. Excuse me. I'd like some advice. Ms Shirakawa, I understand how awful this is for you. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that we are unable to help you. What? Our remit is to support only the victims of crime. I'm really sorry. Are you all right? Yes, thanks. New message Motoko Oishi You know... Everything I've told you up until now has been a lie. I... just wanted to have sex with you. Why? For revenge. What? What did I do to you? You, nothing. It was your girlfriend. Motoko? I've just... sent her a naked photo of me. From your phone. You should text her and tell her everything. Make your excuses. It doesn't matter now. Sorry. Sorry. What? Why are you apologizing? We're no longer together. She's loved someone else For a long time now. What are you talking about? I'm an idiot. I was the only one who didn't know. I'm going. Ichiko. Ichiko, can I see you again? Thank you. You're covered in leaves. What is it? Are you all right? Are you okay? Try and breathe slowly. YOKOHAMA DETENTION CENTER Did you read my letter? Yes. Your mother is dead. She overdosed on sleeping pills. Suicide? I don't know. She always suffered from insomnia. In any case, I'm all you have now. Your only relative. We'll have to live together for a while. Where? Where will we go? Tokyo. We'll pass under the radar there. And your work? Are you still nursing? Why don't you sit more comfortably? Yes. The girl. Is she all right? Who? The girl. Saki Oishi. No idea. I'd like to apologise. Apologise to her. There's no point. What good would it do? - Soba noodles with tempura. - Thank you. - I'm taking an egg too. - Yes, fine Tatsuo, are you at home? Are you free this afternoon? FOR SALE It's about the former owners. Do you know where they went? I see. No. Thank you. Tatsuo. It's no good. They wouldn't tell me.
