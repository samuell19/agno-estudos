I'm a guitar player from Nagoya, Japan. I came here ten years ago, and... doing rock 'n' roll. Actually, my dad loves American oldie like a... He has like a cassette tape for American oldies stuff in his car. And then, I grew up with that. And then, Back To The Future movie came out. McFly rules. [guitar solo playing] Marty McFly is a big influence to me. He showed me how to rock 'n' roll and Chuck Berry music. All those 50s rock 'n' roll and pops. Rockabilly is everywhere, from when I was in China to everywhere in Europe, all over North America. I've heard there's a great scene happening in South America now. It's everywhere. I think people are a little bit more ready for this, because it's also globally, it's really... It's not just a trend, it's also globally recognized. People are actually a little bit more understanding. Well, they understand a little bit better. So, I don't think it's completely foreign anymore. Which is nice 'cause it's the right time for people to kind of be introduced to it again. So, they're excited and they kind of feel... "We can actually come in." It's just the whole movement globally that's happening where people are going slow and they wanna go back to the good old days. They wanna appreciate their time. They wanna move back to that style, and where you put a stamp on your personality. Everything speaks of who you are. We're from Austria, Vienna, the capital of Austria. And we're in the Rockabilly scene because the music is great. And better than... It's real music and not this... utz, utz, utz. [man] I'm from Italy originally, been in the rockabilly scene since I was a kid. We all started the same way, listening to Elvis. Swede and Finland, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, we have done tours, it is everywhere. I decided to move to US, and play rockabilly with the real guys. With the guys that grew up with that sound in their blood. So, that was my goal when I was a kid. I achieved it years later but, here I am. If you wanna karate or judo, you wanna practice in Japan. Or you wanna be a Sous chef, you gotta go to Japan. But, you wanna learn rock 'n' roll, you gotta be here. That's why I came here and played, [blues solo playing] [cheering] [groovy rhythm playing] 50s were the best. Everything's been downhill since the 50s. I love the style, the clothes, the cars. Everything about it is so cool. The 50s had everything. Great music, great cars, great movies and great looking women. I like the old morals and I like the 50s lifestyle. I believe in... a man has to work kind of a thing and a woman stays at home. I would love to stay at home and just cook and clean all day. People comment on the way that women were treated back in the 50s. But, were women treated better in the 50s? Yeah, it depends what you class as being treated better, because then they just sat at home all day. Cleaning the house and cooking food, ready for when their husband got back. I heard a comedian, Louis C.K. say, he said, "If a black person had a time machine, it wouldn't be a good device 'cause anytime, any place he would go, he would have [bleep] issues." Back in the 50s you had to look... You had to be clean lookin'. Dress nice, be polite. Never cross the line on chicks. It drives me crazy when I walk into a store and I see some woman struggling to get a stroller in the door. And nobody's helping her. Like go and hold the door for her. What's wrong with you? Guys, pull out a chair for a lady. Open a door. Pay for dinner. Once you a cross a line on a chick at a show, you're like every guy in the neighborhood, puttin' the moves on her. Can't do that. Kiss on the cheek, handshake. And that was it. No matter if she was a dog or a foxy, treat them all the same. The thing that happened in the 50s that isn't around anymore is people's politeness. It's like Bryan Wilson says, man. I wasn't made for these times. I definitely gravitate towards anything that happened before I was born. I got the name Doris Mayday from doing roller derby when I was a teenager. And I wanted to take on a 50s name, but make it kinda rough and tough. My first job was at Elvis-A-Rama which was an Elvis-themed gift shop. And I was fortunate enough for my co-worker was 65 year old original roller derby queen. So, she told me all sorts of stories and at the time, I was going through some teen angst and I wanted a healthy escape of all of my teenage angst and roller derby seemed like a cool, retro way of doing that. You take an airplane out of America, the only people you're gonna see is Elvis, Marilyn and James Dean 'cause they made a statement for generations, generations, generations. 50s is what had my heart. I love the designs of the cars, the furniture, the clothes, everything. I mean, a lot of these people, just like me, we got all of our houses all vintage, everything. We're kind of like vintage freaks. Retro lifestyle, I just love the aesthetic. Maybe that's super vain but there's nothing like the look of all things 50s to me. The 50s are the best, forget the rest. [cheering] [rockabilly music playing] Rockabilly was the only music that I could play everything I'd learned, 'cause rockabilly has elements of country. Rockabilly has elements of the blues. And rockabilly, a lot of it came from western swing where all those guys could play jazz. Country music's great, but I like the vintage stuff. And it's the rockabilly stuff, and it's hoppin' and boppin'. It's rock 'n' roll. The general rockabilly thing, I would say it would be blues-based, which is black blues. You don't get any better than black blues. So you get a lot of that stuff, amp it up a little bit. That's rockabilly. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's kind of rockin', and it's hillbilly music That's where the "Billy" comes in, which, originally, interestingly enough, was a derogatory term. Some of the swing guys and the western swing guys were calling this "Rockabilly" and that wasn't friendly. They were calling it "The Music" at that point. Three chords and big hair. And rockabilly to me is a down to earth... It's a real image. I mean, it's tough, it's people that stand up for themselves, and it's tattoos. It's not like glitter and it's not like halos and lights and cameras. I mean, it's not like Lady Gaga. It seems like music, nowadays, they expect you to have theatrics and an image that is so unreal and so unnatural. You're like a comic book character. Rockabilly music started in the 50s, mostly in the South. It was rock 'n' roll. It was the rock 'n' roll of the time. And it still is rock 'n' roll. And that's why you had of course Elvis, but Eddie Cochran, Johnny Burnette, Barbara Pittman, Wanda Jackson. These guys were rock 'n' roll. They were young rock 'n' rollers. Rockabilly music. It feels almost like equivalent of soul to me. It's pretty much timeless really. Even though it was really small, Rockabilly really only lasted only five years in the original time. From 50-55 to like... It was done by 60. The Beetles {end-italic} were definitely influenced by rockabilly. Besides the fact that they hired Carl Perkins to come and play on their album and did two of his songs, when they were like at their peak. I think that they were really influenced. And so those early pictures you see, they're all wearing all the leather and they have the greasy hair. We know that they were rockabilly influenced. A rockabilly was around in the 50s really didn't get much acceptance. It was very fringe. They didn't really call it "Rockabilly," although that phrase was used a few times. It was only in the 1970s in Britain where these rare records were getting discovered. They came to the forefront and really became an individual genre of it's own. If I'm playing in a rockabilly band and I start doing jazz solos, people love it, next solo, if I go into the country thing, people love it, if I go into blues things, they love it. Every other genre is so strict. Rockabilly to me, it's like, it meant like a freedom of taking all these different elements and put it into a context. [guitar music playing] I was watching this 80s compilation commercial for this 80s hairbands or whatever. And... hit after hit, and all of a sudden, The Stray Cats {end-italic} come on the commercial. I'm like, "Wait, who are these guys?" They got pompadours and 50s Gretsch guitars and the drummer is standing up and they're all tatted and they look like rebels out of the 50s. I thought this was an 80s crew. I had no idea who The Stray Cats {end-italic} were. And so, I ran into the living room and I was like, "Dad, have you ever heard of this band called {end-italic} The Stray Cats?" He says, "Oh, yeah, they're 80s rockabilly band." Who are they... I haven't really heard them. I just saw them, just aesthetically, they were... they just knocked me out. So I said, "Can we go to the Tower Records," We lived around the corner, "you know the Tower Records, and pick up some Stray Cats {end-italic} music?" And that's when, the first time I heard Rock This Town and Sexy in 17 {end-italic} and Runaway Boys, Built for Speed, it was just... That was it. In that genre or even a few of the related genres, they're still the biggest selling guys in the world. So they're, by definition, they're the most popular rockabilly band ever. Stray Cats Strut, it's like... everyone knows that song whether they... and so now what you see happening, you play rockabilly, you go, "Stray Cats, {end-italic} they know exactly what you're talking about." My guitar idol is Brian Seltzer. I saw him on the movie in {end-italic} La Bamba. And he's got the Eddie Cochran Summertime Blues. And yeah, a big orange guitar and pompadour. And then, actually, after that movie I'm chasing Stray Cats {end-italic} stuff a lot. And do the more punk rockabilly stuff. It's got a great beat that insists you get up and move your ass, man. I definitely can dance to it all night long. And during the day, I can go on through my day with rockabilly music for uplifting, upbeat. I've been into rockabilly since I was younger too, so it has definitely grown onto me. [energetic riff playing] ♪ Well, I drink From a bottle ♪ ♪ She drinks from a cup ♪ And I like To get down, baby ♪ ♪ She likes up I love punk rock music and that's why I have punk rock tattooed on my hands. I also love all kinds of music. I used to love metal music, but I've grown out of that scene. Thankfully. And then, I think a lot of people that are into punk growing up, kind of mature and get into the rockabilly music because it's still very fast paced there's a good beat to it, but it's not as aggressive and crazy as punk. I listen to all kinds of music. I worked in a record store growing up. So I have a really weird, eclectic taste. I don't just listen to rockabilly music. But, I listen to a little bit of everything. A lot of really old music. A lot of 20s, 30s, 40s. Soul music, rockabilly music, Pop music I love Brittany Spears. I'm not afraid of it. [slap bass playing] I'm Djordje Stijepovic. I play bass. I play blast cult bass, and I'm from Belgrade, Serbia. Djordje. He's a crazy ass Serbian that somehow dodged enough bullets and got across the border and made it over here. He's kind of a historian as well as a really bad ass bass player. I got into rockabilly when I was nine or ten. And I played the guitar for a little bit, for a couple of years I played the guitar but, it never really fit me that well and then I switched to bass when I was 12 or 13. And since then I've been playing bass. I've been playing upright bass. I wouldn't say that I'm a psychobilly guy or I'm a rockabilly guy. I'm definitely a rock 'n' roll guy. But in the bands that I dig, from all those styles, for me, it was never that important of how much you call yourself and how would you call the style that you play, it was more important that how you do it. I had this crazy epiphany dream that I had to play upright bass and I remember hearing Stand By Me and realizing that's the difference between what everybody else plays and what I wanna... That sound that I want. So, I snuck out of my house and I went into this... I broke into my high school. I went and I broke in and everything, couldn't get in that door so I hauled ass back to my car and I got a crowbar and just prodded the [bleep] doorframe out and ripped the door out. And stole the bass. And I remember a friend of mine thought the cops were comin', so, he took off in my car and I had this upright bass and I was standing on a football field and I'm like, "[bleep] I need to get out of here." So I was hauling ass out of the football field, into the woods and then I kept it out on the woods I threw a tarp on it. And I just went out there everyday and sort of just woodshedded on upright bass, I would go home, listen to Elvis, Then I'd haul ass back to the woods and go [imitating bass] that's it! ♪ Woke up this morning With a ring in my hand ♪ ♪ My store was pound And I wished it was dead ♪ ♪ Hopped in the car And rolled to Rome ♪ I call these guys "Hipster dopes" because they're a younger version of the rockabilly's. ♪ Going one two three four ♪ ♪ Five six seven eight ♪ ♪ Gonna be great Just can't wait ♪ ♪ Meet me in the mornin' Half past eight ♪ ♪ Hold it up when you Pass that ball to me ♪ [guitar music playing] There's sort of this newer version of rockabilly.

But it's a little different. They love Setzer and Horton Heat and all the guys that are from the second wave of rockabilly, but they really, really are into the earlier rockabillys. These kids, they know who the icons are. They listen to Charlie Thompson, they listen to Charlie Feathers. They know whoever they're into, they know who they're into and why they play like that. And these guys are young. I fell in love with rockabilly music when I had one of my girlfriends about ten years ago play me Wanda Jackson. [Dave] Dominic Puertz, she's a rockabilly. She's actually... Completely in touch with the early 40s, 50s and 60s. She has "Wanda," for Wanda Jackson tattooed on the side of her neck. She's kind of serious. You know what I mean. [Dominic] I went and saw her play for the first time at a hair salon in Redando Beach and there were like... 70 people there and she just like, toured up and I've seen her a ton of times since and she was a hero of mine as a singer. And she was one of my kickers for really getting into rockabilly music. [rockabilly music playing] ♪ Someone told me About a gypsy woman ♪ ♪ Said she could Get inside my head ♪ I saw the movie Cry Baby when I was maybe eight or nine years old. I literally remember the moment at a Mom and Pop video store when those still existed, seeing the VHS tape with Johnny Depp on the cover and I just... I died. I rented it that night and I was changed ever since. And it's super silly and cliche 'cause I say it over and over but I swear it was a pivotal moment in my life. And I say if I hadn't seen that movie, I have no idea what I would be like today. Because it just got struck something in me that I was like... so in love with the visuals and the music and all aspects of the 50s. There's nothing better than playing live. Nothing can compare to getting on stage and playing live. I mean, it's cool to be on set and working on movies and going to premiers and things like that but there's not one thing in life that can compare to getting on stage. Playing with Drake, he's awesome. Especially these high schools, because all the kids are crazy about him. They all grew up with the TV show, Drake & Josh. So they're familiar with Drake Bell being an actor and playing some pop music. And I think it's great because now they're getting introduced to rockabilly. [crowd cheering] [boy] I got into Drake's music about two years ago. I was sitting at home and I thought... My little sister was watching Drake & Josh {end-italic} on the TV and I remember thinking, "He does music now, right?" And I started looking him up and I bought his albums and I just loved it. ♪ I lose a little More of my free will ♪ ♪ Put me in a kettle Full of broken hearts ♪ ♪ Add a little pinch From your magic jar ♪ ♪ Just so I forget the Kind of girl you are ♪ ♪ Baby, I'm catching On real fast ♪ ♪ This isn't going to last ♪ ♪ And I'm through eating Your poison seeds ♪ ♪ And I've built up My immunity ♪ ♪ I'm done with all Your bitchcraft ♪ ♪ I've got to get My soul back ♪ ♪ We've played this Game so long ♪ ♪ I'm not sure That it will come back ♪ ♪ I'm not trying to Make you feel bad ♪ ♪ But baby I just can't live With all your bitchcraft ♪ There's another movement right now that you wouldn't call punk, but they definitely have a rockabilly influence. Jack White, White Stripes, Black Keys, all these guys, if you listen to them, it's blue-sy, kind of rockabilly. We look at artists that look like they have a great potential, that can still do it and why not? It doesn't matter if they're 16, it doesn't matter if they're 26. We really don't have any rules at Cleopatra Records. If the guy was 90 and he wanted to make a record, and we could make a good product, we would do it. If you're 20-something years old, You might get it as a songwriter, but you ain't getting no deal. If you're 19, 17, 18, you got a shot. That's where the world is now. Fast food, boy. [drums beating] Growing up in the 70s, music around that time was just a lot of pop music and I gravitated towards Elvis Presley. He was the first artist that I actually purchased a vinyl record from. Elvis, obviously was bigger than anything. Elvis is a big influence of mine. I'm actually an Elvis impersonator. ♪ Oh, baby let me be Your loving teddy bear ♪ ♪ Put a chain around my neck ♪ ♪ Drag me anywhere ♪ ♪ Oh, let me be Oh, let me be ♪ ♪ Your teddy bear ♪ Loved Tank Williams.

I also have the golden Elvis suit, the black leather Elvis suit and that late 1970s Elvis suit. I'm hosting the Elvis and Priscilla hair contest today, here at the 15th annual Elvis festival at Costa Rica.

Whereas here, if you fly the confederate flag in America, you're looked at as being racist. Punk has never used a confederate flag. And we've seen bootleg... bootleg products with the confederate flag. And we don't really like it. It couldn't have anything to do with racism because rock 'n' roll was started by black people. Some of the best singers and the best records were done by black artists. I don't see the confederate flag as racist at all. That's not what it represents for me. It represents being a rebel and kind of going outside your box and doing things that not a lot of normal people do. So I don't see it as a bad thing. Ugh, that's embarrassing. Are there people that have a full set of teeth that would have a confederate flag hanging? The confederate flag, for anybody that's actually considering themselves to be a rockabilly rebel or a teddy boy, it's very symbolic. It symbolizes our music. I think the confederate flag is a piece of [bleep]. It wasn't just about slavery. It was about being proud to be from the South. It's very racist, look at the history of it all. The Ku Klux Klan and religious Christianity. Rebel behind it is a big X. They don't know that X represented the blood of a pure race. A race they didn't want anybody to have anything to do with them. So on and so forth. [man] Are there any Black people in this sub culture? Actually, they... There actually is. Not as much as... as our nationality, but... there actually is a... If you look around, you will find a lot of... African American, like, in the scene. I don't think anyone's serious who has a confederate flag anywhere around them. I'm sure it symbolizes racism to some people because of the time period. But people's histories are different. And... I don't believe the object itself can be racist, man. I don't believe it. I obviously understand why people would find it racist. At the same time, I think it's more of an issue of it stands as us being divided as a nation. I don't think that's where we need to be anymore. I don't think it needs to be around anymore. That's the quote I stand by, 100 percent. If Chuck Berry had've been white, he would've been the king of rock 'n' roll. Not Elvis. [guitar riff playing] Rockabilly to me is just down to earth. It's like, just people like have a simple life. They like their cars, they like their women and they like to party. [rockabilly music playing] A lot of people think that rockabilly is about anger or violence or rebellion. And it has a flair for that but it's more like stage. That's not the real meaning behind rockabilly. It's about having fun and expressing yourself. My uncle, Jerry Lee Lewis, yeah, he's been known to party a little bit. A drink or two. A chemical substance every now and again. But he's the last man standing though, so... Maybe it's not as bad as they say for you. First off, I know you all have been out here probably having a really good time and you might need a designate a driver. So I always make the best designated driver, because I can say the alphabet backwards. And also, I don't drink. So there you go. So let me do the alphabet for you. I'm on this cleanse where I'm only drinking juice with alcohol, so... There's Bloody Mary in the morning, and there's Jack Daniel's and grapefruit juice. It sounds horrible but it's really good, the rest the day, and sometimes there's juice of the cactus which is tequila and grapefruit juice. That kind of what it's been like for seven days. It has helped me focus more. When I was at Viva, I played eight shows in four days at four different casinos. So I needed to be more focused and I didn't want food that slowed me down a lot. [man] So no food? Yeah, it's been a little over a week. [man] So no food for a week? I'm not worried. Nothing. Not one French fry. Nothing. I've never seen Danny eat a morsel of food. I've only seen him drink copious amounts of tequila. Danny B. Harvey's been known to party. Yeah, every once in a while, if the mood strikes him. And it does, often. I don't know it's just... I don't sleep. That's the theory, I don't sleep. But I don't know, I feel happy. Nothing's changed, so... [man] So what time are you going to bed tonight? Well, tonight I won't go to bed at all.

Teddy bears never let you down, buddy. They're always there for a hug, a kiss. You can talk to them. They're not gonna divorce you, not gonna take your money, not gonna lie to you.

It's an amazing thing how the pin-up culture has really, it's an empowering thing for women. It's really given a lot of women a lot of self-confidence. It's a really cool thing to see. People have no idea at the hospital that I'm a pin-up model or I do rockabilly 'cause if they did, probably fire me. Rockabilly has given me self-esteem. Before, I was just the loser kid in high school. Then once rockabilly came into my life, then I started getting interest in pin-up modeling, and dressin' up and making my face look beautiful, finally putting on makeup. Then everybody started noticing me and talking to me. So, yeah, it's done a lot for my self-esteem. With pin-up culture these days, it's really cool to see that women of all shapes and sizes and different backgrounds and... Every different color, tattooed, no tattoos, classic, modern, everyone can kind of get into it. In a world where women are ripping each other to shreds, it's really nice to see women supporting each other and coming together for the love of kind of the same things. So I kind of fell into being a pin-up girl. I started off, straight from high school, I went to theater school and learned how to do hair and make up. 'Cause I wanted to be behind the scenes. I didn't want to be into movies and films and things. So as a make up artist, I just learned all the different styles of make up. And it was pin-up make up and hair that really stood out to me. And it kind of made me create this style. Which you see today. And I guess that's what got me into the fashion and then the modeling came later on in life. I came from a very small town. And being a little bit different, I kind of stuck out but I was the art teacher's daughter so... I think they thought it was okay. This is something that it could be different now but it's still familiar. And it's also really classic. Especially when it comes to the women's clothing of it. It's classic, it's feminine, it's pretty. It's sexy but not vulgar. So you can stand out but there's nothing to really, actually pin point and criticize. 'Cause it's just classically beautiful. Growing up... I don't know. I guess I was different. I was part of the punk crowd. All my friends were all punk, we just used to go to shows every night. Hang out, I wouldn't say I was awkward or unpopular I definitely had plenty of friends and everyone was cool and very creative. I think that's how I ended up being so colorful. Just because I was surrounded by amazing, creative, colorful people growing up. The rockabilly community is very accepting of all shapes and sizes, colors, creeds. Tattooed, not tattooed, normal colored hair, pink hair, blue hair, green hair. Whatever. You can do whatever you want and be accepted. I did not go to prom. No one asked me to prom. I only went to one homecoming as a pity date for my sister's friend, because they needed even numbers. And then I went to two Sadie Hawkins where you obviously go with a friend. But yeah, no one ever asked me to any. I like the whole scene, but I'm still discovering a lot of it, 'cause I just started getting into it a couple years ago. So I predominantly model, but pin-up modeling is my hobby. And so, I don't do it on an everyday basis. My kids are awesome. I have a five year old and a one and a half-ish year old. They've never known any different. So they don't think it's weird, they don't think it's unusual. They're just like, "Hey, Mum's got blue hair." "Yeah, whatever, it's cool." My little boy, he loves it. He loves my tattoos. He loves whenever I change my hair. I'm always asking him for advise on what I should wear. He'll pick out dresses for me. So to be able to come in and really master those styles and put that whole look together, it turns a lot of heads on the street. My husband always tells me, whenever we go places, he's like, "Oh, this person's staring at you. That person's staring at you." And I... Because I've been doing this for so long, I don't pay attention to it. But it's nice. Women like to turn heads. Making money from being a pin-up girl is really hard and it's not why I'm in it, to be honest. I actually don't make a living as a pin-up model, but I do make a living as "Cherry Dollface" So I'm more of like a brand now. So between YouTube and appearances and traveling and classes and teaching hair and makeup and all of that, that's my full-time job. But the modeling has always been a hobby. It's really good fun. It's a really great confidence builder. And I've just made so many friends from doing it. I came from another country. I left my whole life behind and moved to America. I didn't know anybody. And then from getting involved in the rockabilly scene, I just met so many awesome people and they all had similar interests to me. Everyone's very supportive. And for girls, I think it's great because a lot of girls that want to get involved in pin-up modeling, they're sometimes the more awkward girls, they're the more... They don't have the confidence or they've been hurt in the past. And they get into pin-up modeling and it's... It builds them up and it makes them feel that they can do anything. I look a lot different now than I did in high school so, there's a shock factor. If I was to walk down the street with straight hair and modern clothes, they probably wouldn't look twice at me, they wouldn't think it was me at all. So it definitely gives you like, "Oh, there goes the 50s girl." But also, people treat you differently. The times when I do happen to roll out of my house and not be done up, I notice people don't smile as often, people don't open doors for you. So it's almost like they expect you to behave in that manner of 50s quintessential manners and kind of the politics that go in there. [rockabilly music playing] Dressing like this makes me feel incredible. Just makes me feel super confident. I dressed somewhere similar to this last night when I was at my ten year high school reunion. And everybody was just like, "Oh, my God! You look incredible. You look amazing." And I'm like, this is one way you can look and go anywhere and your... it shows, your confidence shows. Everything is just so much fun. You're not gonna look like the person next to you. You're not gonna have the same clothes as the person who went to Forever21 or any other stores with the mall or whatever. It feels amazing. Everybody looks at you. I like attention. They all give you attention and it's a lot of fun. It's a lot of fun. The best thing about being a pin-up model is all the people that I get to meet and work with and all the places I've been able to travel to and shows and... It's just really great meeting great people. A lot of pin-up girls will do work for charities. So whenever I do events, that's whenever I build my own events, I always do raffles. So we all raffle off like a Gretsch {end-italic} guitar or something from one of our sponsors that they've donated. And then that money will go towards a really good charity. We're here today to give you the raffle money we raised at the charity bomb show, Squid Ink. So we raised $550 for the Mason Streets Veterans Association. And I'm handing that to you and I hope it really helps. I am sure that the veterans here at Madison Street will - definitely appreciate it. - Thank you. [engine revving] ♪ You know the other night I was sleeping ♪ ♪ I heard my Mama Talking to my Papa ♪ The whole rockabilly scene is pretty much surrounded with this type of cars. I love the cars. My dad kind of brought me up with that. And actually, the car on the other side of the street is a '48 Chevy. And that was my first car. My dad actually bought it for me before I was born. The Dead Sleds Pirate has to have a ship, a greaser rockabilly has to have a sled, you know. If it wasn't for car clubs, then there probably wouldn't be a lot of rockabilly fans. They sponsor, they support the scene. And yeah, they like to party but if it's getting too rough, it's time to leave. [man] I build cars out of one reason, man. It's because there's no reason for me to live if I'm not building cars. [rockbilly music playing] [man] These guys are all the coolest guys and the coolest girls anywhere in the city. Someone breaks down and we see them off the road, we pull over and we will help that person so he could get back on the road. And they would do the same for us. Styles of the 40s and 50s, It's just something thats very stylish, beautiful. You can admire the curves. Kind of like a woman. When we started this car club, about ten years ago, we originally wanted to keep it about five guys, four guys but now it's grown to over 20 members. [airplane buzzing] Our ladies are as part of this club as we are. Our family, our kids, and that's what makes this club the way it is. True rockabilly needs a cool ride, man. A hot rod. Now my car ain't pretty, but it's pretty [bleep] fast. And I love speed. Speed kills, kids. But what a way to go! [brakes screeching] [drums playing] Psychobilly is part of where I come from. - But it all rocks. - Vulgar language. Somebody made up that name for really crazy sort of high tempo, kind of thrashy rockabilly. But it really is rockabilly played a little faster, a little louder. Other than that, I don't really see the difference. Psychobilly is rockabilly on a higher level of steroids, meets some hardcore punk. [psychobilly music playing] ♪ She got me going [man] Psychobilly is, it was the spin off of the punk thing. And I dig where the cats were coming from, I just... I don't know how long you can sing about a gravestone or whatever. You can party in the graveyard all day, but they've been partying in the graveyard for the last [bleep] 30 years. [psychobilly music playing] I knew The Cramps in 1979 as a teenager. And that was the first time I heard the word psychobilly. I love The Cramps. Honestly, I didn't know much about them until the last handful of years. The Cramps inspired a lot of the psychobilly bands. But their genre transcends any labeling, really. They're their own thing. I would definitely say The Cramps coined the term "psychobilly." ♪ Let's go baby Let's go get it ♪ ♪ I am the madman, baby ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ Out and run ♪ Come on and roll ♪ Let's go baby Let's go about it ♪ ♪ I am the madman ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go ♪ Poison Ivy {end-italic} is like, hello, she's like a hero of mine, fashion and otherwise.

Just taking that wildness of roots music and the early pioneers, Johnny Burnette, Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, definitely. Little Richard. Definitely. If you guys can jump around like this for five minutes, I will dare you, Mr. Energy, Tim Polecat. [crowd cheering] [guitar solo paying] You have... punkabilly, you have a lot of different gothabilly now, like you know... It seems that a lot of people want to invent their own thing. We are a zombie rockabilly band. So, in other words, we dress like zombies. We have zombie go-go dancers. And we put on a great show. ♪ Zombie baby ♪ ♪ Will you be mine? ♪ ♪ I love your rotting flesh ♪ ♪ Until the end of time ♪ [man] People are attracted to things that are real. Musicians will take that and try to create their own thing out of it. [bass music playing] Rockabilly life, man. Rock 'n' roll tattoos, women, what it's about. [rockabilly music playing] [woman] So one of the great things about rockabilly is body art. Which is fantastic. You'll see girls with sleeves, full face tattoos and necks, and all down the legs, pin-ups. It's gorgeous. When I am 80 years old and I have these tattoos, I'm just gonna be able to tell my grandkids I was a badass. I got these tattoos, I was a badass. And my mother told me that I wouldn't be able to handle the pain of it. So, joke's on you, mom. I got a lot of them. I think it's cool that there are those pin-up type looking girls. They have a certain look that they... They're taking elements of the 50s and they're also taking elements of now of which tattoos are very popular. And then making it their own. And I think that makes really good, modern, unique art. I decided I was gonna get tattoos when I was maybe five years old. I've always loved them. And in the town that I grew up in, there wasn't really a lot of tattoos, and if it was, it was all on men. But I wanted to be the tattooed lady. I live the rock 'n' roll lifestyle 24x7. I tattooed all of my skin, my face. And then I have my mustache grown but it says rock 'n' roll right above my lip 'cause I eat, sleep, rock 'n' roll 24x7. 2:00 a.m. My friend, Smutty Smith, got tattooed in Britain at a very young age and still is covered in tattoos and he was probably one of the most visual people in the Rockabilly scene from the 70s onwards. An inspiration for other bands, in fact. He got the look and he has a lot of tattoos. I come from a working class suburb of London. And London had a much different culture to the United States over the period of years To the working class, tattoos were a part of our culture. The teddy boys, the rockers, the bikers. But when I first came to America, and displayed those tattoos in 1977, I realized that the only people at that time in the US that had tattoos were ex-marines, cons and sailors. They weren't trendy and there were very few tattoo shops in each city. And actually, New York didn't have a tattoo shop because it was illegal. Los Angeles only had Cliff Raven and Bob Roberts. Now, there's tattoo shops in every corner in LA. Kinda always knew I wanted to get them but my mom was like, "You're gonna be homeless if you get any tattoos into my roof." So I waited until I was 18 and I moved out. Reason I don't have any tattoos is that I'm afraid of needles. I'm a sissy. I love tattoos, personally. I don't really think it's really an issue. I think regardless, tattoos, no tattoos, you're still beautiful, regardless. It's definitely. For me tattoos is another form of art. I'm just glad kids went and got everything tattooed. 'Cause then, now I can do it. Man, they see a tattoo on your neck or something, it's like, Woo. Pull over. That's the way it used to be few years ago, kids. Don't start with your face now. Save something for later. If you have your face tattooed, you can be very [bleep] successful. And that's how I guess I am out to disprove that in society if you have your face tatted, it doesn't mean you are some [bleep] ex-con or some [bleep] loser. I don't have any tattoos 'cause I don't think too many rockabilly guys from the 50s had tattoos. There was a time in American culture where you probably couldn't work in a Wells Fargo bank 20 years ago if you had tattoos on your hands or your neck. Now when you check into The Hilton in New York City, the check out girl's sleeves, has got more sleeves than me. It's totally a part of pop and art culture now since bands Stray Cats, Rock Cats, Guns N Roses, Motley Crew, I mean and it's David Beckham, it's... When famous people, when people in the limelight have tattoos, it's just a course of time before the popular generation kind of latch on to that I think if God wanted tattoos on the body, he would've put 'em there. That's my own opinion. I don't think you should try and... cover up what God gave you. They make rude comments and stuff. It's like, "Why did you do that? You ruined your life." All that kind of stuff. My mom doesn't really like it but she's old. My grandpa would probably turn over on his grave. My mom doesn't really like it. I mean, what mom does? But I tell her, "You don't pay my bills. "I pay my own bills. So if you don't like it, "I guess just lose my phone number." But she keeps calling me. [laughing] Some girls probably think I'm crazy for tattooing my whole face but... there's not really they can say. I'm good in bed. This is normal. We're normal. Tattoos is a very recent thing that's come to the rockabilly scene in terms of style. And it probably came from teddy boys in England. [bass music playing] Teds have been around since 1953. Actually since the 40s. But we didn't get the name "Teddy Boy" till 1953. It means Edwardians. So really, it was born in Britain. They wear these Edwardian... It was the period, man. They quiff their hair. That's where the... Jelly roll came from. And they'd wear these drain pipe pants and long jackets. The teddy boys, it's about respect and we look at ourselves as the top in rock 'n' roll and rockabilly music scene. We feel that nobody else is even on... As good as us. We feel like the rest are basically like the dirt on our shoes. Teddy boys hated the punks and the punks hated the mullets and the mullets hated the skinheads. But then you realize, when you've left school that you'd get beat up by a bunch of skinheads. You were in a classroom with them a year before in school. So we all went the same. The carpenters and brick layers and welders and fishermen and bakers. All from working class backgrounds with the same disgruntled attitude. Whether it be about the economy or the lack of jobs or Margaret Thatcher. So the identity for each of those groups really was like a gang. [man] Back in the day, there would be a group of Teds and you wouldn't even want to walk by them. They were very feared. There are fights. I had to go to a lot of gigs and end up getting in a fight. I think I'm one of the last Mohicans that really liked teddy boys because I like Teds but he doesn't act like a Ted. Teds are really polite and they're really hip and they're really smart and are great DJs and they have a certain cool etiquette and teddy boy Brett has none of that, and he's got a blabber pull on his nose. I'm a barber since Barbara crossed my nose. Teds want to beat the [bleep] out of that guy and so do I. I don't want to be liked in the American Rockabilly scene People that do like me know where I'm coming from. They agree with what I say. The people that don't like me are the people that are posers because they know I'm calling them out. I'm gonna read some of the comments that were pulled off the internet about me. I think they're pretty [bleep] funny. "You're one stupid [bleep] idiot." "I sincerely hope you die." "Top douche. Narcissistic fruit salad master." "A rich, dumb, ugly [bleep]." "Pretty gay having a bunch of guys tattooed on your body, especially being a guy." [laughing] [bleep] is funny. Some people call him the most hated man in rockabilly. I don't think Greg knows how to express himself. Hopefully, you can get what I'm saying, Greg. You're not expressing yourself too well sometimes. And what you're trying to say would piss off a lot of cats. You said, "I'm the only true rockabilly," but I know what he was meaning. He's meaning this, he was watching the scene, like what goes on in Viva. In the last couple of years, all these kids come in like a fashion show, don't give a [bleep] about the music, don't know who Gene Vincent is. That's like a sin. You don't know who Gene Vincent is? This is our St. Gene Vincent. And that's the point he's making. That's the point he was making with his body. I just don't think he has the words to say it. [rockabilly music playing] Hair is very very important to be in the rockabilly scene. And that's for guys and girls. If the hair is not right, then you just look wrong. [rockabilly music playing] I think it's great, anything that has a statement that you look out, you turn around on the street, you're driving, "Wow, that guy looks cool. He looks like he's really into music." I like people that have a certain look like they're really into what they're... Making a statement, visually as their fashion attire. Well, for me, this is my signature. So there's videos on YouTube where guys have 5,00,000 views of them combing their hair. [woman] I got into doing rockabilly hair because I always loved this era, I loved this style. Hair is very important in the rockabilly world because it basically is just an expression who you are and what style you're trying to evoke. And it just pulls the whole look together. You can wear pin-up or rockabilly clothes, but you don't have the right hair, it's not gonna work. The Rockabilly girls, to me, look very cool when they look like they walked out of a 1956-57 photoshoot. [woman] My favorite blond of all time is Diana Dors. Like Marilyn who? Diana Dors, she was a British film star in the 50s and she had the best hair. The best hair ever and she just had a banging body and she was hot and to be able to come in and really master those styles and put that whole look together, it turns a lot of heads on the street. We are here today because I'm having one of my vintage hair styling classes where I put out there. If girls wanna come in and learn how to do hairstyles that I do, they can come in. I show them step by step, three different styles on a couple of different models and they can get up close and personal and see exactly how I do these hairstyles. We didn't know what I was doing or how to do it. So, recently I just perfected it. [laughing] So it's extremely important. It's like the cherry on top. All the guys have the best hair ever. It's all... I totally love a pompadour. What I don't like, are the psychobilly pompadours where it's shaved. The mohawk hair, slick, high and tight. Shark fin and psychobilly quiff comes out and it looks like a shark fin. And we spend a lot of money on product for our hair. My hair is not moving in anything. The wind, if it pushes it, it'll be right back. So, it's pretty sturdy. [man] I started Layrite deluxe pomade, that is a necessity. Really, I had my own pomade before Layrite, and it was Hollywood's pink pomade and it just didn't wash out. No, never again! My whole comb had hair in it. Oh, my God. I don't want to be bald by the time I'm 30. [music playing] [man] Nobody looks cool in the middle of their haircut. You don't wanna see a girl before or during your haircut. Only after. I know Hollywood's barbershop don't allow women in there. [screech] It's odd. A woman, I wouldn't say belongs in a barbershop, 'cause they have their salons. If a girl came in here, the conversation would change. You have to be able to do pin curls, you have to do finger waves, you have to be able to do roller sets. 'Cause the barber is more of a man's kind of the deal. But I know there's women out there that do barber, but... [laughing] I cannot step foot into the barbershop during business hours. If a woman does want to enter the barbershop, she cannot so we let her sit in the front. He wants to have a barbershop where he doesn't allow women, it's his shop. He should be allowed to do that. It's America and they can do what they want so... I think it's cool that they decide to stick with tradition. Rockabilly, any good rockabilly cat's going to want to have a good pom you know. It was love at first hair.

Viva Las Vegas is like the United Nations of rockabilly. It's the biggest international event, has the most people. Any casual observer would think it was the biggest music scene ever. Viva Las Vegas is gonna happen because this cat, Tom Ingram, came out and he brought this style of the English festival thing. Weekend festival to America. He actually helped helped save the scene. Recently, I was referred to as the Walt Disney of rockabilly. Viva Las Vegas is the granddaddy of them all. Al carte. Everybody from around the world comes to Viva every year. People from... Germany, Finland, there's people that are obsessed everywhere in the world. Everywhere! People come, it's like, kind of the Mecca of rockabilly, once a year. I have to see the people. As much as I love the music, and the cars and all the outfits. It's a huge fashion show! Viva Las Vegas is good but 90 percent of the people that are there are posers and jokes. [woman] The worst part about rockabilly, the Silly Billys! Yeah, they upset me. The Silly Billys to me are people like The Weekend Warriors, whenever they go out to a show, they just like to dress up. And they don't really know the life or know the music, but they just like to pretend for like a car show that they're part of the rockabilly movement, but... If you go up and talk to them about a car or anything, they're like, "What? Huh? Uh?" Yeah, it's kind of sad. It's definitely, one, a show not to be missed. 24 hour a day costume party. You get to dress up and be a badass. It's more of a big, cartooney, kind of a scene. Do the pin-up in the cars take away from Viva? No, that's kind of like why I dope. Viva Las Vegas is different to other festivals because it's all held in one hotel, where we have multiple function rooms, multiple vendor rooms. Plus the pool party and then the large area outside for the car show. There's Viva Las Bowling, which is just everyone having a bowling tournament. [rockabilly music playing] [man] The pool parties. The big event that spans three days, ♪ Get so excited when I Rock 'n' roll, yeah ♪ [man] The car show, is very strictly pre-'64 period correct. And that's where we have the largest stage. ♪ When I rock n roll ♪ In these shows, when we have the burlesque competition and the burlesque showcase. And then there's the pin-up contest, which I'm gonna be doing this year, which is gonna be really fun. [upbeat music playing] Viva Las Vegas is music first. Yes, music is number one.

Viva Las Vegas! [man] Put your hands together, from Memphis, Tennessee, 50s teen idol, Mr. Jimmy Angel. I don't know how to read and write. Never learned it. That's why I don't do email, I don't do... messages on the phone, Somebody knows me, they call me. I want to get America back and I'm starting to think I can pull it off before I go bye bye. I'm 79 now, so... We're trying to get it done. I hope so, baby. The deal is, when you get knocked down, no matter who you are, you get up. You don't lay down. You get up and show 'em what you are. [all] We love you Jimmy Angel! That's what this is all about. I don't care about money. I care about leaving footprints. I'm 79 years old. So I want people to know that I'm a 50s bobcat and I tried my best. For a man who wears black, I've had a colorful life. I think the reason why people love the way psychobilly, rockabilly and the whole car thing is because it hasn't gone too mainstream. It's theirs. They feel like they own it, they own it. When they connect with somebody that looks similar to them, that shares the same type of ideas and ideals, I think there's a stronger connection to the whole scene. Anything from back in 50s, it's very dreamy. And everything has positive vibes. That's why I like it. I think the rockabilly lifestyle, it's kind of second nature for myself and I think for a lot of people, I know personally, I grew up hearing stories from my grandparents of going to dances and post war and going to their home and everything being vintage, and listening to old music and to me, it always was a safe place. And a very welcoming time and also, very romanticized times. A guy that's a musician, that's living the lifestyle, like anybody, like a Danny Harvey, you ask yourself, "How does that guy make a living? How does he live that lifestyle 24 hours a day?" And the reason how a guy like that does it is he's working 24 hours a day. He's basically working seven days a week, When I discovered rockabilly when I was a kid, my whole life changed. I knew what I wanted to do. And I still do it. I'm happy, I would say that I love the life I live and I live the life I love. We're just here to take the rockabilly scene back. You can't be in a bad mood. You're just gonna go in there and it doesn't matter what's going on in your world right now. You're walking out sweaty, probably a little drunk and pretty happy. I love to be a part of art and creativity and meeting people that are so into that too. And I found it in this scene. There are so many beautiful rays of sunshine in this whole scene that I just... I'm hooked and I want to keep meeting more people. And I love that it's the music, it's the feeling, it's the vibe, it's the dancing, it's the cars, it's the babes, it's everything. Rockabilly is a nostalgic salute to quaint slice of Americana. We live in 1950s time capsule. [woman] You shouldn't care what people think. Be who you wanna be and what makes you happy. If you wanna avoid criticism, say nothing, do nothing, be nothing. [rockabilly music playing] I have this dream like I got to play bass, and then I started looking around going like wow... [disruption] Get the fuck out of here! Yeah, I'm kind of the Italian redneck, yeah, I'm half Italian and half redneck, my Dad was from Missouri, and my Mom's Italian, yeah, it's kind of a weird mixture. Here we go, Rockabilly swings are... Oh, fuck, rockabillys... [man] That's my fault, that's my fault. Rockabilly swings to a different drummer, sure, I'm sorry. [mumbling] Sorry. If you want to be, fuck it, I'm sorry, man. [groovy bassline playing] That's it, I think I'm done, it got me though, man, I hope I can hold a mic Friday night. Do you promise to adopt each other's hound dogs, and always always give each other especially sex, a hunk of burning love? [rockabilly music playing] I learned tap dancing on YouTube, mostly a video on Sammy Davis Jr. [tapping] [rockabilly music playing]
