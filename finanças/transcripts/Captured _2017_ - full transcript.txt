To whom it may concern. Oh, too close for comfort. You guys don't need to see the pores on my nose. Hey guys. My dad's out of town for the night, and I'm all alone. Does anyone out there wanna keep me company? That's right, come to Mama. I've been right here waitin' for you. Oh, I can think of a few things. Oh, you wanna see my bra? Well, I don't know if you've done anything to deserve it. But I'm feelin' generous. Is that what you wanted to see? Woo. It was gettin' hot in here anyway. Oh, you wanna see my bra on the floor? Hold please. Welcome back, guys. I made sure to leave a link for my depository account. Right here above. Oh, I'm sure you would. Well, since I'm feelin' generous, I'm gonna make you a little deal. If y'all can raise just 500 dollars in five minutes, I'll show you my depository. Woo! Oh. You like that, huh? Well, what would you suggest? Real creative, guys, real creative. I'm feelin' playful. Welcome to the party, boys. Woo! Oh you, dirty, dirty boy. You can stick it... Right... Here! Remember, boys, I love dick pics, but I can't spend them at the college book store. Make sure you put all your cash right here. Oh yeah. Keep the dirty comments comin', and keep your wallets open. Is that all you've got for me, guys? I've been so generous tonight. Can you be generous with me now? I really need a new computer before I go to college. Oh. Sweet pink? Stop, you guys are making me blush. I don't know. It's kind of a big deal to me. How much is it worth to you guys? Oh yeah! Daddy's home! Help me. Party girl Nicole. Comes from a broken home. She's lucky, really. I saved her from a life as a sex worker. After all, God is merciful. Known as the squad, they think they run the school. Disrespecting authority is one thing, but they've been live streaming drug-fueled sex parties and charging an audience to watch. They are beyond earthly resolve. This is in God's hands now. Ashley Duncan. There she is. 17, fine kid on the surface. But when I did a little digging... Surprise! She's fucking her soccer coach! And a married man at that. Thanks to my remote desktop login, I've been to collect all the evidence I need. Just see for yourself. God put Ashley on my path when she transferred to Agora. She may not rest in peace, but soon she will be laid to rest. Hi. This is dumb. Hi, future Ashley. I hope that you're the only one watching this. It's me, Ashley from the past. The year is 2016, I am a high school senior. I'm sure you remember all of this, because the past couple of months have been particularly traumatizing. It was rumored that I was engaging in an inappropriate relationship with my soccer coach, so Mom and Dad forced me to transfer to Agora Height's Academy where that kind of thing doesn't happen. Nobody knows my name, but they know me as the girl who fucked her soccer coach, and I have never felt so alone. I got you, 'cause the therapist that Mom and Dad have forced me to see, has also suggested that I do one of these video diaries, so that I can see how the world perceives me. Ashley, breakfast. Okay. Jesus Christ. You know, future Ashley, I hope that you've made it out of the wilderness, and that your life is a lot more smooth and cool now. Right now sucks. I would do anything for like one friend. Literally anything. All right, well, big history test today. Wish me luck. You know, I don't get why you're so angry. You serious? Nicole's little strip cam shit gets out, we are all so fucked. I mean, you're not serious. Chill! Everyone knows Nicole was trash. No one's gonna connect her bullshit to us. Whoa, color me shocked. What the fuck are you two doing in school? Fucking California High School Exit Exam. Yeah, have to retake it to graduate. Oh, interesting. I didn't realize you needed a high school diploma to be a street whore. Yeah, can't wait to be a 23 year old who still lives with his parents and hangs out with high schoolers. You're living the life, Cade. What, are you having a stroke or something? What, no, sorry. I was just picturing you rubbing Nutella all over your stank-reckel. You fat fuck. Hold on. Hailey's... What the actual fuck? Tell me you guys peeped psycho shit last night. You wanna see my slop nipple? Oh Daddy, don't kill me. What are you guys talking about? Are you fucking kidding me, dude? No, what happened? Oh my God. So, Nicole did this super weird meta shit and like faked a home invasion or some shit. What? Yeah, guys, she got on Peeper last night and she was doin' her thing, you know, the old rubbing her baloney boobies everywhere, and then this shit happens. Oh yeah! Daddy's home! What is wrong with this bitch? It's sad, really. Like, we stop hanging out with her, and two weeks later she's begging for negative attention? Which is the only kind of thing that she can get. You guys think this is fake? Oh, absolutely. Fuck her, dude. I hope it is real. Otherwise I'm gonna have to kill her myself. Babe. Oh, fuckin' relax, Jenn. This is serious, we need to figure the shit out. Brock's right, you guys. We do need to have our stories straight, in case anyone asks us what's goin' on. Easy. Nicole was doin' a lot of blow. We begged our friend to get help, but she wouldn't listen to us, so we had to give her an ultimatum. Stop usin' or stop bein' our friend. I'm just so sad that she started stripping on Pepper for drug money. But I guess that's legal now 'cause she's 18 and everything. Smart Hailey, I like it. You don't think it's like too mean? Oh, no, Jenn, you're right. We should just go around telling everyone we're part of a secret sex club that broadcasts, oh, what is it? Oh, that's right, underage poononny online for fucking money. Good call. He's got a point, Jenn. It's a bummer that Nicole's out of the group, but she made her choice when she went public with her shit. She's 18, that's legal. I'm not, and I just don't wanna have to explain to my Mom about our extracurriculars. How do think that Daddy will feel about watching the feed from last week? Yo, watch it, okay? All right, if anyone asks, Nicole's got a nose candy problem. Next thing we gotta talk about, her replacement. Oh, Cade, how about you step out from behind the camera, and shake that dick harder and fast? Go sexy. Real talk, though, no one's gonna pay to watch fat ass over there. She's right. Besides, we need your techy skills to keep the Peeper profile private. Yeah. No randos, paying audience only. That's not gonna solve shit. You won't need fat ass doing tech shit, 'cause no one's gonna wanna watch a sausage fest. We need a chick. All right, look, my parents are out of town. Clock's tickin'. Operation replace a bitch has begun. Engaging find a ho radar. You're so stupid, Cade. Bye Felipe. Hey Hailey, fifth period, you and me some nose beers? Oh, girl, you know I'll never miss nose beer period. All right, cool. So, I'm just sitting in class, minding my own business, when this gets thrown at me. Hey Ashley, I've noticed that you're having a hard time making friends. I would like to be your friend, and I would also like to give you a dirty sanchez, or a Roman shower. Lady's choice. What a gentleman. So I told my teacher I left my binder in my car, said I'd have to go get it. The joke's on him. I don't even have a car. But what I do have right now, is a free moment to fuck off. Fuck you. And just like that we're outside. Excuse me. You have hall pass? No, I didn't know I need one. I'm just going to my car to get a binder. You need a hall pass. I wonder if Daddy knows that he just bought me a 70.000 dollar coke table. Whoa, crack head, save some for the rest of us. Chill, Brock just got a coke Costco. Like, we're legit rolling in blow. Shit yeah. I gotta send this to Tony. You crazy fucking bitch. Want a bump? Hold on. Nobody has time for this. Take a fucking bump. Wait. We good? Yeah, we good. Teacher coming! What? Nothing. Now what did you just say? This is my car. Okay. I'm just gonna get in my car now. To get my binder. Out of my car. I'm opening the door now. Who the hell is that? Get my stuff out. Okay. Fuck. Be right there. I have to leave, but I wanna make sure you go right back to your class. Right back to class. What the hell is she doing? Thanks for your help. Oh my God. You totes just saved our asses. Yeah. I do that all the time. That was chill. You're the new girl, right? Yeah, the one that fucked her... Fucked her soccer coach? Yeah, that's me. I like this one. Yeah, you're pretty cool. Yeah. What are you doing later? I'm supposed to go right back to class. What about... Like tonight? After class. Oh, I was joking. I don't have any plans if you guys were going out to hang out or something. Why don't you come over, and we can Peeper and hang out... Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, I'm free. Cool. -Okay. Yeah. Add us on Peeper, we'll catch you later. Okay. Okay. -Cool. Catch you later. Jenn and Hailey are seemingly an insignificant part of the population, but their viral influence is limitless. * Ain't nobody come here to bag you * Send your own people Okay, so is all this shit really true? You really fucked that old man? I always wanted to fuck a 40 year old. What was it like? Were his balls like tap tap tapping on your back? No, but yes. Shut the fuck up. It's your Hollywood story. Yeah right. Seriously. Oh yeah. I'm gonna need that courage. Okay, spill. All right, well, I guess it's not that exciting or whatever. Coach just gets me. Boys our age are so retarded. Shut your dick sucker. Brock's not retarded. No you, Brock's a fucking textbook mongoloid. Fuck you! Okay, like last week he fucking tasted his own cum? But whatever. Okay, well, he was wasted, so... Tasted his own cum. We're not even talking about Brock. We're talking about Ashley. Now, Ashley, please continue with your story. Like, how did you even get caught? Well, I was chatting with him after practice one day, like waiting for my Mom to pick me up, but when she showed she had the cops with her, and they put coach in handcuffs, and then I had to go to the station and give my side of the story. Pause. How the fuck did the cops get involved? I don't know, they would only say that they had gotten an anonymous tip. So, did you tell 'em about your relationship? Yeah, I gave them every detail, and I made sure to show the sex tape. Stop, that is so fucked up. I'm kidding. I operate with the prison code. Snitches get stitches. I'm drunk. But, no, I would never fuck him over like that. But, you know, word spread, and my parents wanted me to be able to focus on my senior year, so they enrolled me in Agora Heights. That's so fucked. Right? Because it's like the court of public opinion has already decided my fate, regardless of the legal system. I'm like Steven Avery. Steven who? You know that guy from... Yeah, yeah, DNA, whatever. But like, you fucked the coach. You're guilty. Hey. What, she is. I mean, I am. Hello, hello. You scared the fuck out of us, Cade. Oh, I'm sorry, did I catch you guys at a bad time? Oh, if y'all were smooshin' pussies and finger bangin', don't let me stop you. As a matter of fact, you know, maybe I'd like to watch and give you a few pointers. All right, so who's this? Nicole's replacement? Who's Nicole? This slut we used to be friends with. Don't worry about her. She's a nobody. Hey beautiful. Hey Tony. Hi babe. What you got for us? Hang tight. Brock's got some orders coming in for us. Who's this? Oh, this is Ashley, she's cool. Okay, so you remember how you kept your mouth shut about you and your coach? Yeah. Everything you're about to hear is gonna be our secret. Squad secrets. Got it? I can keep a secret. Welcome to the team, Ashley. Hey love, what's up? Just some shop talk. Hey new girl. Hey, I'm cool. Yeah? Yeah, I mean, Jenn brought me so you can feel free to speak freely. Oh, we briefed her, Brock. Cool. You wanna play a little drink or dare? Sure, I mean, I'm already drinking, so it's like not a new thing. Cade, set the account up. Here, you wanna be camera ready. So here's how the game works. You get a dare, and if you don't wanna do the dare, get a drink until you do the dare. Okay. Cade. Ten steps ahead of you, boss. Depository has been activated, and Peeper is ready to go live when you give me the word. God, and that's why I keep your fat ass around. Okay, Ashley, when I tell Cade to broadcast, we go live on Peeper. We got a depository all linked up so we can make a little money from our viewing audience. Oh, okay, so they just pay to watch us do nasty dares? Exactly. I dig. Yeah, like, no one at school knows about this. It's up on risqué, and we're not all 18, so we operate deep underground. Okay. Okay, you heard her, Cade. Broadcast her ass. Hey everyone, how's your hump day going? So Haley, for 50 dollars I dare you to give Jenn a hickey that looks like a tush. Stupid. Oh! Do you like that? That's impressive, eh. That's my baby. Now Jenn. Yes Tony? For 100 dollars, I dare you to take off your top, hop on one foot and recite the pledge of allegiance. You're a fucking troll, Tony. Oh, you gonna cost us a hundred dollars and drink? That's not the team spirit. Ow! Oh yeah, take it off. Pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which... Consequences mean nothing to these children. Nicole could have served as an example. But no, the squad is recruiting their newest member now. They will consume you like a cancer as their sins spread. That's not the entire dare. I'll drink it off. Are those her real boobs? Oh God no. Daddy bought those when she was 16. All I got was a nose job. I just got a hamster. So, new girl, all eyes on you. Just be nice. Cade, shut it down. I haven't even proposed a dare yet. What's going on, Broc? What the fuck was that, babe? There's no red flags on my end. Jesus Christ, it looks like your mom just caught you tasting your own cum or something. Shut the fuck up, Cade! Fuck dude, sorry, salty subject. Babe. Fine, it's fine. I gotta go. Jenn, call me later. Ashley, have fun. Got lucky this time. Get the fuck on. Couldn't get enough of me? Whoa man, you okay? Are you fucking with me? What, no. I swear to God, man, if you're fucking with me I'm gonna fucking wreck you. Chill out, bro, I don't even know what you're talking about. Oh my God. The bruises, they bring out the beauty of her eyes. Fuck, are you in on this? Relax, this is an app. See. Holy fuck. Yeah, man, she did the same thing on Peeper last night. That bitch is starving for attention. Are you still fucking her? No, whore's disgusting. Smart man. Explaining to Jenn how you got the herp would be super awkward. Shut the fuck up. No judgment here, pal. What do you think about Ashley? She looks like she got ghost nips. Seemed a little weird about drink or dare. I don't know, man. She did fuck a geriatric, which means she must have low self esteem. She'd do anything to impress us. I'm gonna have Jenn invite her to our little party tonight. Dope. The more the merrier. Baby. If I'm gonna have to look sexy tonight, you have to respect my beauty rest. No rest for the wicked, babe. We wanna invite Ashley to perform tonight. Okay, whatever. I'm gone for 10 minutes... Oh. Hello, everybody. What's up? What's up with you? My parents are out of town tonight, so I'm fittin' to have a little party. A party, huh? I'm in. Just like that, no questions asked? Just like that. A couple things you gotta know before you come over. Yeah, like, this is an invite only. Not your average party party. Cool, whatever it is, I'm down. Awesome. I'll have Hailey pick her ass up on her way over. But, until then, I really need to nap, you guys. Jenn out. Yeah, I'm pretty tired too. I'm still fucked up from earlier, so... Really looking forward to tonight, Ashley. Cool. Me too. Bye. Told ya. She'd probably let us do butt stuff. I could smell the desperation from here. It's your boy Cade here. You're fucked up, Cade. Awe, Tony my baby boy. Now now boys. Making sure we're all squared away for tonight. Ashley will be playing the role of Nicole this evening. Oh, 'dem titties though. Man, this ginger, I wonder if she's got them ghost nipples. I said the same thing. Right dude. Settle, settle. Tony, did you pick up yet? Fuckin' know it. I got the downers, uppers, beta blockers. You name it, I got it. You wanna feel somethin', you don't wanna feel somethin', I got a pill for you. Oh, I fuckin' love you, Tony. I fuckin' love you too. Cade, you send out the bast on Peep? Consider the peepers blasted. Barf. Oh barf on you, Tony. Cool come back, Cade. Man, fuck you, Tony. Enough. See you boys tonight. What a difference a day can make. Am I right? All right Miss Therapist, riddle me this. Who's got two thumbs, and an invite to an exclusive squad party tonight? This bitch, that's who. * 'Cause I've got friends now * Because people like me * Because I'm pretty * And I'm so fun and stuff It's Hailey. * Mary Jane knows me Make sure you look good. Check. Push dem titties up. Roger that, though you know I was already 10 steps ahead of you, Hailey. Tell your 'rents you're sleeping at my place. But that's a lie, and lying's bad. Duh. All right, I'm just finishing up dinner now. I'll be out shortly. X-X-X. Okay, so, do I know what I'm doing is wrong? I mean, yeah, kinda, I guess. But like big picture, never gonna run for President. I don't wanna be a celebrity or a public figure. I don't even think I'm somebody's role model, so last I checked this was my life. Why should I continue to live it for anybody but me? What? Just checking on you. Okay, I'm busy doing this stupid blog thing for therapy. Okay? And then I'm gonna go to a sleepover, study sesh. Watch your tone. Okay, geez, sorry. Okay, you done with your plate? Yeah. You can go now. What has gotten into you, Ashley? Maybe nothing's gotten into me, Mom. Maybe I'm just happy again, all right. Maybe I've gotten over the trauma of having to switch schools senior year. Or maybe I finally worked through my anger issues at you and Dad for accusing me of some heinous shit. Lower your voice. I'm glad you're adjusting. That doesn't sound like an apology. Ashley. What? Okay, Mom, I'm gonna serve as a good example for you. Are you ready for this? I'm sorry. Now, I'm gonna go, and I'll see you tomorrow. Whose house are you staying at? Hailey's. A bunch of us are sleeping there, but don't worry, I'll have my phone on me so you can check in and stuff. How are you getting there? Hailey's picking me up. I have never met Hailey. Okay. Ashley, do not take that tone with me. If you want to spend the night at this girl's house, I need to meet her first. Okay. Are you fucking kidding me? Show time. Hey girl. Hey bitch, I'm parked out front. Ooh, love the cleave. Oh, you like that. I put a little extra effort in for ya. Well, hurry your shit up, we gotta go. Everybody's waiting for us at Brock's. See, the thing about that is my Mom's gonna have to meet you. Are you serious? I know it's super lame. Do you mind just coming in real quick? Fuck, fine, but I'm leaving the car running. Okay, no, that's perfect. I'll be right down. Hi Mrs. Duncan, I'm Hailey. Hi. Nice to meet you. You too. Okay great, so you've met, so we're gonna go. You girls are gonna have fun studying? Oh my gosh, yeah. My my was even nice enough to make us a veggie platter. I can't get this one to eat vegetables to save my life, so good luck with that. Oh, she will have them tonight, I promise. I love vegetables. But we're gonna go. Okay, bye! Make good choices! Babe, where ya at? I'm poppin' more than pills over here. Mmm-mmm-mmm. Babe, we're just around the corner. I'm horny, I might just go ask Cade if he'd let me titty fuck him. That's not gay, right? Supes hetero, babe. Very gay. Is this Brock's house? Oh yeah. Oh my God. -It's fuckin' dope, right? Wait until you see the inside. This is insane. This is the biggest house I've ever seen. Yeah. What was that? That's my dick. Not that. What was that? Did you leave the back door open? No. What? Did you just drive all the way here with the door open? Whatever, we're coming in. Ah, that's super scary, babe. Hey, way to cut it close. Sorry, her Mom kept me here. Hey, put this on for Daddy. It's base now girls. Countdown to nine minutes. Thank you. Pucker up. There will be a lot more where that comes from. Yeah. I want my boobs to look like your boobs. I think your Daddy's gonna have to put a deposit down for that. Hi Mom, we're just super studious over here This is so creepy. Gettin' my supe on. Ooh, that looks hot. Yeah. Is it like a costume party? 'Cause I didn't bring a costume. It's all right, sweetheart. We got one for you. That's my girl. I thought you'd be down for anything. I mean I am, but, what are those and what are we doing here? If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself. Okay, Ashley, what these dumb little twits failed to mention to you is that this isn't your average party. Fuck you, Cade. Oh, I would fucking love to, Jenn. Really, I would. But I'm too busy explaining to the new girl what the fuck we're all doing here, 'cause you can't follow simple directions. Hey. Hold that thought. Here's the deal. You could take one of these, like the rest of us, and you're going to enjoy it. Cool? I mean... Can I finish? Awesome. Now, I'm gonna sit here and set up a live stream of you, Hailey and Jenn doing some sexy ass shit, while creepy dudes wire money to an online account. Are you fucking kidding me? No. Hey, what the fuck, new girl? I thought you were down. No. Whoa, hey, it'll be fun. Don't touch me. What, you only let your coach touch you? I told you guys that in confidence. Oops, sorry. I don't fucking need this. I'm calling my mom. Fuck it, we don't need her. Yeah, fuck her all right. Hi Mom. No, I'm fine. I'm just, I'm feeling really sick. Can you come get me? Everyone's studying, I don't wanna interrupt. Please just come get me. Thank you. I'll text you the address. Well, this is what I look like when I'm feeling really fucking stupid, and really fucking embarrassed. I thought that this was gonna be the first time that I had like cool friends, and I was one of the cool kids. Look at this house. I thought everything was turning around for me, and now I'm still just the big fucking baby waiting for her mommy to pick her up. That's a real good look. Fuck. It's sad. Whatever. We're fine? Guys, it's not fucking fine, it's the opposite of fine. What if she tells someone what we're doing? What if she goes home and tells her mom what the fuck we're doing? Fuck, Brock, he's right. You need to stop her from talking. You guys, come on. She's not gonna say anything. She's a fucking loser, but she's not gonna say shit. All right, enough. Cade, what are our numbers looking like for tonight? Right now we are at 9.056 bucks. Yes! Look at me, okay. Everything's gonna be okay, all right? Now, you're gonna remain calm. Got a big show to put on, and if you're cryin', you're not gonna look sexy. Okay. Tony, Tony. Go find Ashley, make sure she won't tell. All right, people, let's do it! It's fucking show time. Don't worry, I got her address. Yeah, shut her up. Keep her calm. Three minutes 'til go time. I know. Oh relax, Tony. You got off easy. The rest are going to suffer. Sssh. Sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh. Sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh sssh. Quiet now. School night sluts. I'll pay 50 dollars for the first kiss. Hmm, make it a hundred, and then you bought yourself a kiss. Fuck yes. I loves this, ladies. I wanna see some tight pussy. Boss of boners, ladies. Let's see that pink! What the fuck? Oh, we've gotta take this off. Yeah. What the fuck? Just let go. Just let go. There you are. Come with me. Let's get you out of sight. What was that? What's happening over there? We're pissing the wall off, Jenn. I'm sorry, but what the fuck? I didn't pay for this. Oh, God, are you fucking kidding me? Goddamnit, you guys. Where's Tony? Who gives a fuck about Tony? I'm hard as fuck, bitch. I'll cum faster jerking it to puppy videos. Peace out. Wait, we've got a show for you. Yeah. We wanna show you so bad. Oh, dear Lord. Party's over. Where you goin', fat boy? You move, I'll cut you right now. It's cleansing time. She who is sexually immoral sins against her own body. Please don't kill us. We'll do anything. My father is a very powerful man. What the fuck? He will give you anything to help you. You don't have to fill me. You're fuckin' dad can't do anything for us now. We're fuckin' dead, man. Shut the fuck up, you fat fuckin' pussy. He's right. The lord of boundless mercy has asked me to cleanse your heart of all its sin. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, okay. My heart is free of sin. I swear to fucking God. The lord hears and sees all. You've bullied and broken all those around you. Now it's time for redemption. That's it, bro. Your penance. Take your medicine. Fuck, no. That's right. Take your medicine. Ah. It's a pity you'll die quickly. I was really hoping you would experience the overdose before he met his maker. God is good. Oh, please God. I'm so sorry. I admit that I have done wrong. Please, make sure that my Mom knows that I loved her, and take care of her when I'm gone. Everyone asks for forgiveness in the end. When they'd turn their back on him long ago. Please God. I repent for my... Enough! Good boy. Why? Because I am the righteous and you are not! You've been cleansed. Praise the lord. See yourself the way others see you. I guess that's the whole point of this stupid fuckin' blog thing. But I guess I get it now. It's just that yesterday I would have given anything just for one friend, and today I would trade everything that I have just to be a nameless face in the crowd. Fuck me. My throw back app just decided to remind me that I haven't always been a broken person. It's just... Is this how others see me? Puffy. I can't do this shit anymore. I just can't do it. I'm gonna try and stay home sick from school today. Come here, c'mere. Get out. Get out, get out. Down on your knees. Get down. You, come here, come here. Get out! Get out, get over here. Get out! Get down on your knees. Shut up. Shut up! And with that, it's lunch time. So, this is the period where I like to pretend that I'm FaceTiming with somebody, so that nobody tries to pick on me 'cause they think I'm on the phone, and I'm sure they assume it's with my mother. The sad thing is, she doesn't even wanna talk to me right now either. So, I'm forever alone. Do you young ladies know what this is? This is a drone. And this little thing right here is my eye. My eye in the sky. God's eye. Do you know I've been watching you? We've been watching you. And I must say, we're very disappointed in you. Quite the nifty invention, right? Not only can I watch you, but I can record you. This footage will be my bible. God's testimony. And his will will spread across the internet, and you, you will be my example. Look, I just programmed a flight. I told her to go up and hang out for a few minutes. Look, no hands. Hey, you know what? This is a great teaching moment. Right? Just as I programmed the drone's flight path, so does God program my flight path. Hailey, pay attention! Pay attention. The lord has put his faith in me to carry out his will. Now, initially I believed that my objective was singularly focused on your slutty friend Ashley, right, and that you would get in the way. Go ahead. Scream. That's okay. Are you not getting enough attention? Jenn, Jenn Jenn. You know, every healthy tree bears good fruit, right? And a disease tree bears bad fruit. Do you follow? Basically what I'm trying to say is, Hailey, pay attention! Accept this as your path to salvation. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit. Just the same as diseased tree cannot bear good fruit. If healthy tree bears bad fruit, it's simply cut down. We can't risk the possibility of bad trees' disease being spread to the rest of the orchard. Hailey is a result of a bad tree. What do you fancy yourself, Jenn? You know, we can recognize a bad tree by the fruit they bear. Oh, no no no, Jenn. Don't be sad, we are friends. Don't be fearful or wanting, because this is lord's work. You understand, right? What is that? What is that? I'm sorry. Lord, she wants forgiveness. Oh. What about you, Hailey? Do you have anything to say? No? I'm sorry. I will sing the mercies of the lord forever. With my voice, I will let thy know my faithfulness to all generations. What is that? I'm sorry. Oh. Breathe. Breathe. Take a breath. Take a breath. You will call your mother, you will let her know that you are going on a camping trip with the boys for spring break. And if I hear so much as a crack in your voice, I will kill you. I will kill you. Do you understand? And you will die. Hi baby. Hi Mama. I packed snacks for you and your friends for the trip. You comin' home? Yeah, we just decided to leave early. Just for gas, and I didn't want you to worry. What? Your bags are still here. Why would you leave without telling me? Hailey, I'm not okay with this. Yeah, you're right, but it's senior year. Can you be mad at me later? We will talk about it later. I love you. I love you too. Bye. Why? No, no. Oh my God. No. No! No, no, no! No, please, no! Jenn, oh Jenn. It'll be okay, it'll be okay. I thought I explained myself perfectly, Jenn. I know you're not a bad tree, just a result of bad fruit. But, you see, the problem is that, oh gosh, do you know if you continue to exist, how do we know that when you're rotting in the ground that you're bad seed isn't gonna lead to other bad trees? I am here to do the lord's work, Jenn. My faith and his word transcends the love in thy soul to thyself. Stay quiet. It'll be okay. Don't fight it. Good girl, it'll be all right. All right, it'll be okay. Oh. There. Well, looks like it's just me and you again, video blog. Fuck. I would literally rather have a pineapple shoved up my ass every single day for the rest of my life if it meant I never had to see the squad again. Thank God they're slackers. I bet they're ditching today. I haven't seen them yet. I just have to keep reminding myself that I am only as small as I allow people to make me feel. What the fuck does that mean? Mom won't stop asking questions about last night. I haven't said anything to her yet, but I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. I feel like shit could literally not get any worse right now. I don't know if you've noticed, but I am hiding in the bathroom at school. Fuck! What the fuck? This is so fucking weird. Shit, well... I guess it's on me to either stay mad or actively decide to forgive and forget. Absolutely not. Public seems safe. Sure. That seems angry. Bygones, right? Well, okay then. I guess that settles it. Ugh, just one more class. You can do this, Ashley. Good luck. One, two, three, four, five, six. Six. Six down, one to go. Fuck. I'm so uncomfortable right now. I'm like shaking. I just keep trying to tell myself that everything's gonna be okay, but I feel very much like a turtle in an alligator's mouth pretending like I'm being befriended but I'm really being eaten alive. Does that make sense? Fuck, where is he? I'm just gonna text him. Show time. Oh my gosh. Oh, oh. Oh, sorry, I don't wanna bother you. Oh, it's no bother. Oh, thank you, I hate being a burden. We all need a little help from time to time. You can just put it right back here on my lap, and I'll take it from here. Don't be silly. Where ya headed? Sure, just right here around the corner. Yeah. I'm parked right there. I'll help you. Thank you, you're so kind. No worries. Say, what's up with the camera? A social experiment. Oh, like that chick who did the expose on the catcalling? Yes, yes. That's pretty cool. Can I be in your movie? Sure. You know, if you play your cards right, I might even give you a lead. Don't make me look bad. Of course not. Yeah, yeah. Do you mind just folding the wheel chair up and tossing it in the back for me. Yeah, no worries. You can just put that back there. I play soccer, and I tore my ACL last year, so I know what a bitch it can be to be immobile. Is that how you met coach Williams? What? It's okay, go to sleep. Go to sleep. Karma's a bitch, Ashley. Maybe you shouldn't sleep with married men. I am devoted to you, lord. Because of you, all things are possible. You're my salvation. You are my light. Amen. Help! Please somebody! Help me please! Help. That stupid bitch! Oh no. Where do you think you're going? No! No. No please. I don't wanna go back in there, please. No, I'm sorry. I'll be good, I'll be good. Oh, now you'll be good? Oh no, yeah. It'll be okay. It'll be okay! -No! Steps. Please let me go. No please. No please, don't put me back in the room. No. Get in, get in! Come here, get up. No, no. Get up! You don't have to do this, you don't have to do this! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up! No please! No, no no. No, no no, please, I'll be good. I won't leave, I won't run away again. Please don't. No. No, no, no, no! Please, please! I'll be good, I'll be good. I'll be good. No, no no. Please don't, no! No, no please! No! Please don't do this. I can't trust you anymore, Ashley! You're just like the rest of them. I can't trust any of you. Please. I'm sorry. Lies, all lies. I'm not lying. Do you see what you made me do? I'm sorry. The fuck you are. I'm so sorry. Don't you fuckin' lie to me, Ashley. Don't you fuckin' lie to me! I'm not. Look at me, look at me. Do you think you've lived an honest and good life? What are you talking about? Please, look at me. Please, I don't know what you want with me. That's not what I asked. Do you think that you've lived an honest and good life? I don't know what you're talking about, but please just let me go home. I just wanna go home! Please, please. Did you know that adultery used to be punishable by death? Did you know that? No. No. No, of course you didn't. Please, just let me go. Please, just let me go. I won't tell. I won't tell anybody. I won't tell anybody, just untie me. Please don't leave me tied up in here. Please, I'm scared. No! Please no! No! Please, please let me go! Please untie me! Please, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good, I'll be good! I'll be good! In case there's any question that I doctored the footage of the hashtag squad, for the sake of my message, please find the cell phones of the students in your mailbox. Perhaps after reviewing the smut on these devices, you will understand the importance of my mission. Please untie me. Please, just untie me, please, please. Thank you. Thank you. Please, stay there. Please. Please, don't hurt me. I've told you to be quiet. Now, I have no choice. I'll be quiet. Please. I'll be quiet, please, you don't have to hurt me. Please. A higher power judges. I'm simply his messenger. What? Oh, Ashley. Hey. You know, I have a boy close to your age. And whenever he gets hurt, I tell him the cut is only one tiny feeling, and the pain will go away soon. I tell him it's only one tiny memory of the feeling that troubles him. And soon, Ashley, you won't have to worry about the memory of your pain, or the pain you caused. What pain did I cause? I've never... No? I swear to God I've hurt anyone in my life. No, no? No. You've done nothing? No. Let those lying lips be silenced. I'm not lying. You think that Mrs. Williams believes that you've done nothing? She certainly feels the pain from you fucking her husband! I'm just a kid! I'm just a stupid kid, and I'll never do it again. Proverbs 30:20, the way of the adulteress. Please. She eats and she wipes her mouth, and says, "I've done no wrong." You, you're fucking a married man. I'll never do it again. I'm abused for her. The adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death. No! And soon, Ashley, you won't have to worry about the memories of your pain, or the pain you've caused, because you will cease to exist. Please. The student body of Agora Heights Academy are participating in a horrific abomination. They livestream every element of their lives without fear of consequence. Greed, lust, gluttony, pride, sloth, wrath and envy abounding. Once you're live streaming, you never know who's watching until you've been captured. I've been watching, and God has shown me the way. Attached, please find evidence of what has transpired. I hope you can use this as a lesson. Our father who art in heaven, hallow be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. In the name of the father, and the son and the holy spirit. So endeth the lesson.
