- Okay everyone, back up. Come on, let's go. Who called this in? Found him like this? Hey guys. - Hey, Bob. - Hey man. - You guys wasted a trip, doesn't look like a homicide. - What the hell happened to him? - Looks like a heart attack, but let the coroner make that call. - Excuse me, so that's my working stiff? - Something sure scared the shit out of the poor bastard. - Must've been the prices at the pumps. - What really frightens you? What makes your flesh crawl? What gives you nightmares? It's under your skin. What makes you dread tomorrow? Go on. - What brings back childhood traumas, makes you think you won't survive the night? What drives you insane? - I don't get it. - That's it. - What's it? - That's it, my idea, or hot concept if you like. - It's been done before. Fear of spiders, Arachnophobia, fear of sharks, Jaws. - I'm not talking about general phobias, I mean specific ones, subjective, unique to that person. Here's what I have in mind; I'll get a camcorder and interview a cross section of people on the street, I'll record their answers and analyze them. Based on their ethnic background, gender, and class it should prove interesting. Subliminal terror, which is appropriate for Ghastly Horror Magazine. - I see how it could work. What's your time frame? - You tell me. - I need a first draft within two weeks so that it can be edited and proofs ready by the end of the month. Our illustrator will need a copy before that for the page headings. We have the right to reject the piece if it doesn't suit our format so you'll be doing this on spec. - Understood. - Here's our basic agreement, which indemnifies us against third part lawsuits and contains a confidentiality clause. Like I said, there's no guarantee we'll use it, but I've been in this business long enough to know you have to be on the lookout for fresh blood. - Fresh blood, interesting choice of words. - How can you be sure you can find the right people for this article? - I guarantee you the people I interview will be interesting to your readers. - Here. Remember that our market is teenage boys 12 to 16, the kind that have the hots for Vampirella, you know what I mean? - Promise not to interview anyone over 30. - Good, you know you can't trust them. - You frightened me. - You're easily frightened. - And your not? - Oh, macho men like me, we never get frightened. - I don't like macho men. - Well I can be sensitive, too, you know. Whatever you want. - Something in between. - A new age man, eh? Well I guess I'll keep that in mind when I come of age. See you around six tonight? - You know it's against company policy for us to date. - Rules are made to be broken. Besides, I thought we'd just run into each other at the steak house. - I don't think so. - No, it's my treat. - Because I'll be at the sushi bar. - Oh okay, six o'clock then? - We'll see. - Debbie, I need you to look at this contract and compare it to the previous version and make sure there are no omissions. - I'll get right on that. - Thanks. - Hey. - You're late. - Shh. Hey, how'd you do on that digital design project? - Not too good, I got bogged down on art history research. Boring. - I thought it was kind of interesting. - What's that? Ghastly Horror, ick. - Believe it or not I used to steal those from my brother and read them when I was a kid. - You like that gory stuff? - Sometimes, when I'm in the right mood. - Are you in the right mood tonight? - I don't know, why do you ask? - There's this new horror movie opening and I want to see it, but I am not going alone. - What about Brian? - He said he's cramming for an exam but he's probably at a strip club with his friends, as usual. - Don't you think it's kind of insulting when guys go to those places? Like we're not good enough. - You're taking it too personally, as long as he looks and doesn't touch, I don't care. - I don't know, those places give me the creeps. - Hey, I know, why don't we go to a male strip club? See what's its really like, the full Monty. - I would rather go to the movie and see how easily you scare, asshole. - Hello, Mr. Evens. - Hi, uh, could you give me Fred Johnson's invoice? - Yes, Mr. Evans. - Hey, Bob. - What's up, buddy? How'd it go? - Got the charges dismissed. - Nice. - But our client was guilty as hell. Slum lord, I feel sorry for the tenants. - Don't wear your heart on your sleeve, partner. God damn it, man. - What's up? - The Lakeland Real Estate contract, I can't find it anywhere. - I gave it to you like an hour ago. - I know, but I can't find her and she filed it somewhere and I don't know where. - You're talking about the new temp? - Yeah. - What's her name? Rita, no, Benita? - No, they both left. Michelle. - That's it, Michelle. I couldn't remember her name. Hard to keep up with the turnover rate around here. - Well our new girl Friday seems to have her own filing system that needs a freaking cryptographer to decipher. - Call up the agency, get somebody else. - What's the point? She's not gonna last, anyway. At least she's eye candy. - You hit on her yet? - Dude, I'm about to after that. Got to be fast around here, lots of competition. In fact, I saw you looking at her just a second ago. Nice body, right? - Yeah, but she's a lousy secretary though. - You know what they say about dumb blondes, the reason their so stupid. Everyone fucks their brains out. - Whoa, whoa, you better watch it you're gonna end up with a sexual harassment suit. Yo, I'm not gonna represent you. - Mhmm. - You need to learn to separate business from pleasure. - Yeah, my pleasure is my business buddy, alright? Wish me luck. - You're gonna need it. Where you taking her? - You know what, man, with this one, I think I'm gonna do a tour of my old neighborhood, you know? Show her where I grew up, what a family man I am. Do you ever try that crap? - If I took her to my old hood, she'd get mugged. - Well anyway, I'm going in so watch my technique buddy. - You're gonna need it. Oh, should I take notes? - I'll tell you what, if she turns me down, she's all yours. - Thank you for your leftovers, sir. - Michelle, hey got to tell you, you look amazing in that dress. Listen, I'm kinda hungry, I figured you gotta eat, it's about lunchtime, what do you say go get something to eat and have some sex? What do you think? - No thanks, Bob. - Not hungry? - Here's that invoice, Mr. Evans. - Thanks Michelle. Wait a minute, this line is wrong. - Did I make a mistake? - Yeah, it should say clients fee not clients free. - Oh, sorry about that, I'll fix it. Guess there are no free clients around here. I saw what you charge people. - You know, even ambulance chasers got to make a living. - Well at least I'm free this evening. - Huh? - I'm free, I'm not doing anything tonight. - All alone? No date or anything? That just doesn't seem fair, now does it? - I know. - Hey, found that contract you were looking for. It was filed under your name. I'm not free tonight either, but I won't charge too much. I do know a great Chinese place in Times Square if you're in the mood though. - Sure. - Hi I'm doing an article for Ghastly Horror magazine, would you like to be interviewed? Sure. - What really frightens you? Nothing frightens me. - Hi, I'm doing an article for a major magazine. If you participate, I'll just need you to sign this release form, fill in your age and occupation. - What's in it for me? - $100. - Alright. So now what? I just need you to answer this question, what really frightens you? - What type of shit is this? Get the hell out of here, no one rents space in my head. - What can I say, it didn't frighten me? - Excuse me, ladies, I'm doing an interview for Ghastly Horror Magazine. - Oh my God, we carry that. - What? - At our store, we both work at a bookstore. - Would you like to be interviewed? - $100 if you answer our survey question. - Well what's the question? - What really frightens you? - For 100 bucks I'll tell you what frightens me. - Great, just fill out the form, you age and occupation. - Okay you ready? - So Ms. Brookes what really frightens you? - Well it's more like a recurring nightmare, I dream that I'm in public in my underwear and everyone is staring at me and then somehow I end up in a strip club where all the men grab and attack me. - Sounds kinky, Chloe. - It's actually pretty horrible. I've had that nightmare ever since I moved to New York. - Thanks, if I use you you'll be in our next issue. - Hey, what about me? - Sorry, I have to expand my demographics. - Lucky you, better get me home before your nightmare comes true. - I know, right, not a good idea flashing C notes in Times Square. - How come they didn't have any raw fish? What's it called? - Sushi. - Yeah, I was really in the mood for Sushi, but it wasn't on the menu. - Sushi is Japanese, that was a Chinese restaurant. - Oh. - Excuse me, I'm doing an on camera survey and wonder if you'd like to participate. It's for Ghastly Horror Magazine and we'll pay you $100 if you answer our survey question. - What's the question? - What really frightens you? - Just a minute, Michelle, just let me look this over. I guess it's okay. - Mr. Evens, what really frightens you? - Well if you want me to be serious, spend 10 years working my way out of a really bad neighborhood. Drug dealers, pimps, hookers, high crime. Anyway, I worked my butt off and earned a scholarship to a law school. That made the homies kinda jealous 'cause I got mugged a few times, harassed just about every day. I guess what really frightens me is running into those gangs again. Either that or having to defend one of them as a client. Does that answer your question? - Yes, thank you very much. - Let's go shopping. - Hi, would you like to participate in our survey for Ghastly Horror Magazine? - Ghastly Horror, what's that? - It's a fan-zine. - You read that trash? - I did when I was a teenager, what's the survey? - Well we'd like to know what really frightens you. If you participate I'll give you $100. Just fill out this form and sign. - I'm game. You want to know what really frightens me. I'll tell you what really frightens me, this goes way back to my childhood, I used to think there was a monster underneath my bed. I still check every now and then before going to sleep. How's that? - Very interesting. Thank you. - Thanks. This covers dinner and a big tip. - You barely made the deadline, but the release forms seem in order. Is this the final draft? - Yes, and it has the changes you request. - Good, let's see how it sounds. - What really frightens you? You ever wander alone at night? What makes your flesh crawl? What gives you recurring nightmares? Take a moment and think about it before turning to the next page. We asked three New Yorkers what really frightened them. I think you'll find their answers quite terrifying. 29 year old Drew Evans is a trail lawyer for a New York firm. One would think a trial lawyer has seen everything and nothing frightens them, but something scares our counselor. He was raised in a dangerous neighborhood where local gangs attacked those who wore three-piece suits instead of a hood. Drew still dreads encountering gangsters who settled disputes the old fashioned way, with baseball bats and knives. - Hey some intellectual stimulation for your lunch break? - You got it. - Here's that lease. - Thanks. - So, how was it? - This guys finances are a mess. - Come on, not that. I mean how was she? - Who? - Michelle. - Man, will you give me a break? - Come on, bro, I gave her to you. - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? If she turns me down I said you could have her, remember? - That's not the way it played out. - Whatever, anyway how was she? Wild, right? - Man. She was,. She was none of your business. - Are you-- Unbeli-- Some guys get all the breaks. You know, you get drop dead babe, you know what I'm saying? And I get the merely attractive ones, we'll say. - You're better off with the merely attractive ones. - Yeah, why's that? - Most drop dead gorgeous women, they know their hot so they hold back just a little bit until something better comes along. But attractive women will give themselves to you completely without reservation. - And you know this from experience, I assume? - You could say that. - Well, I guess I never thought about it that way. - I'm sure you haven't. - You know what, buddy? In case she dumps you, I'm gonna take my chances anyway. - Will you please get out of here? 20 year old Chole Brookes is a college student who works part time at a bookstore that carries our magazine. As a loyal reader, she doesn't frighten easily. Except for her recurring nightmare about being exposed in her underwear in public. Our Miss Brookes would be a lamb for the slaughter to the predators who prowl the city streets at night. - That was a long lunch break. - Sorry, I met Dale. - What did you have an afternoon quickie? You were gone for 45 minutes. - That's not enough time for a quickie. - I wish I could say the same thing about Brian. Sometimes I feel like he's got a stopwatch going when we do it. What about Dale? - Don't ask, don't tell. - That bad, huh? - No, I just like to keep my sex life private. - Well. So are you two going with us to the club tonight? - I don't think so, I really have to finish my portfolio. If I don't ace it, I'm gonna lose my scholarship. - I already told the guys that you're coming. And they're on their way. - Thanks now I'm stuck and I have to go get changed. - Knowing them, they probably stopped at a strip club along the way. Don't start that again. - I'm sorry, I forgot that you have a hang up about that. - Not a hang up, I just think they're kind of gross, like internet porn. - Don't tell me you've never seen an X-rated movie. - Worse than that, I kinda made one. - You made a porn? - Sort of. A couple years ago when I was dating Bobby he video taped me stripping in his dorm. When we broke up I asked for it back but he said he already erased it. - Do you think he did? - I hope so, every time I log on I'm afraid I'll find myself downloaded on some website. - That would really freak me out. - Yeah. - Chloe, you're not gonna believe this, you're famous. - What? - Remember that guy who interviewed you in Times Square last month? - What really frightens me? - Uh-huh, awesome. - Can't believe they picked it. - Congratulations. Thanks. That's weird. - What? - I was looking for his name, but it only says ghost writer. Brett Andrews is a computer programmer in Manhattan. However, he is haunted by memories from his childhood. Brett was afraid of monsters under his bed. Every night he had his father check before going to sleep. Old habits die hard and even today Brett looks under the mattress before turning out the lights. - Hey, so what's your answer? You gonna stay over tonight? - I can't, I have to spend the night at my parents in Westchester. - Oh, how about this weekend? - I know the real reason you want me to stay over. - It's not just that, I really want to be with you. - I wasn't talking about sex. - Huh? - The real reason you want me to spend the night is so that I can check for monsters under your bed. - Yeah, right, what brought that up? They used my bit, pretty funny, eh? - Everyone else around here seems to think so. - Good news travels fast. And yes, I want you to stay over tonight so you can check for monsters under my bed. What do you say? - We'll see. We hope our survey gave you a fright. Maybe you'll check underneath your bed tonight before turning out the lights. One can never be too sure. - Hey Debbie, just checked under my bed and no monster so you're free to stay whenever you'd like. Okay I'll keep the bed warm for you. Good night. - Hey Drew, I see you got the case dismissed. And you didn't even have to play the race card. But what's with these new violations and who's supposed to pay for them? - Yes, yes Mr. Johnson. Everything on that list. - The guy died last month of a heart attack, before he paid his rent, could you believe that? The place is empty. It's empty! I'll fix it when I get a new tenant. - Sir, I strongly suggest you correct everything on there before our next court date, please. - Come on the building's in Hell's Kitchen, not Park Avenue, what do these tenants expect, a jacuzzi in their bathrooms? - Okay, yes sir. - I'm not operating a charity club. Yeah. - Yes, alright you take care too. - I'll see you in court. - What can I get you guys? - A vodka soda. - Rum and coke. - Bottle of beer. - Ditto. - Got it. - So guys did you hear about Chloe? She's a celebrity. - What'd she do? - She's in a magazine this month. - Which one? - Ghastly Horror. - What the hell is Ghastly Horror? - Monster magazine. - I never heard of it. - About a month ago this guy was walking around Times Square asking people what really frightens them, Chloe got picked. - No shit, Chloe, what really frightens you? - You're gonna have to pay me 100 bucks to find out. 100 bucks? - Yup, that's what they paid me. - She's not a cheap date, is she? - No kidding. - Let's dance. - Chloe, where are you going? - Oh baby. - Do that thing I like, you know the thing, the spin, do the spin! Gentlemen, two for one! Two for one! That's right, get some. Yeah, come on, take it off. - Whoa baby, come to daddy. - Michelle? You're already there? No, I guess I must've lost track of time. Of course I didn't forget about you. I'll be there in five minutes, okay? Alright, bye. - Hey, brother what you doing back in the old neighborhood, huh? - Yeah, you must've missed us. - That's right, Mr. Oreo cookie missed us. - We thought you forgot about us all these years. - Listen man, I'm not looking for any trouble. - You're not looking for any trouble? Then what the fuck are you doing here, huh? I mean, this is trouble neighborhood. - I told you this chump forgot about us. - Give me this motherfucking jacket. Do I look like executive material to you? - Why, yes, meet me at the country club tomorrow morning, we tee off at 10. - check this shit out. Our homeboy here's an attorney defending slum lords in a court of law. - Slum lords? Motherfucker, you trying to kick us out of our home? Trying to make us homeless, man? - Look, look, here's my wallet, I've got a couple hundred in cash. - Give me that, you trying to bribe us or something, man? - Just tell me what you want. I want a lawyer. - Okay pro bono, whatever you need. - Good, 'cause you're gonna need one after I kill you. - Yeah hey. - What happened to you? I waited at the bar for half an hour. - I'm sorry, I must've fallen asleep. - Great guys tried to pick me up. At least you could've called. - I did call. - No you didn't. - I didn't? - No. - Am I forgiven? - Yes, but you owe me a movie along with dinner. - Whatever you want. - Okay. - Chloe, slow down. I haven't even had mine yet. So what happened? Why'd you run out like that? - I don't want to talk about it. - Did something happen on the way home? Were you mugged? - No, nothing like that. - Is it your school project? , I haven't even started it. - I thought it was due tomorrow. It is. I'll have to get an extension. - Listen, you're really stressed out. Why don't you relax? Your parents are gone, I'll give you a full body massage the way you like. Just take off your clothes and-- - I'm not taking off my clothes. - Are you going to sleep with them on? - Maybe. Hey. - You're late. - I know, I need the day off. I need to clear it with Sherry, where is she? - I don't know, what's up? - Nothing, it's personal. - What's the matter? - Nothing, I said it's personal. - There's no need to get bitchy. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to I just, I don't want to go into it right now. - Okay, look I talked to Dale this morning, he told me you were really upset last night. Are you guys splitting up or something? - No, nothing like that. I just have to go meet someone. - Sounds mysterious. - Cover for me today, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. - Look, if you want to talk about it later-- - So you want to get some lunch or just the coffee? - Just coffee, where's that damn waiter? So how'd you find out about our firm? - Well I was surfing the net and I noticed that you guys do pro bono work. - Pro bono, yeah, that's not me, that's my partner Drew, actually. - Oh, should I talk to him? - Not yet, I usually like to check out the new clients first. - Excuse me? - To see which attorney is right for their case. Relax, take it easy. So anyway what are we talking? - Well I want to use a magazine, I was interviewed for their latest issue. - So what? They misquoted you? - No, nothing like that. It's hard to explain. I guess I want to sue them for punitive damages. - Punitive? It's not easy, but what magazine? - Ghastly Horror. - You're kidding me, right? - It's a fan-zine. - Chloe, come on, did Drew put you up to this? Is this supposed to be some kind of joke or something? - Look, if you can't help me I guess I'll have to go to someone else. - No, you know what, I think we should just go talk to Drew. - Brett, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - I always feel awkward in these situations. - What's going on? - As you know I've always given you good reviews and I think you're past due for a promotion, but-- - What's up, am I being canned? - No, but we have a policy here and it's not like I agree with the policy, but it is our policy. - What are you talking about? - You're relationship with Miss Collins. You know we don't allow inter-office dating-- - We're not dating, we're just good friends. - You were seen having dinner together the other night. - Oh yeah? By who? - That's not important. The important thing is I need your assurance that your relationship with Miss Collins is strictly professional. - Absolutely. - Good. Well then, um, that's all. Thank you. Oh hi, you startled me. - I thought macho men didn't get scared. - Not scared, just startled. Is there anymore coffee? - If you want to call it that. You look tired, too much partying last night? - Too many nightmares. - Well maybe you'll sleep better tonight. - I hope so. - I hope so too because I'll be sleeping over. - Chloe, just give me one second, okay? Michelle, Michelle, Michelle. - Hi Bob. - How are you? - Fine, how are you? - I am doing well, thank you. Can you check my messages for me? - No messages for you. - No, you sure? Alright, I'll check back later. Chloe. - Yeah, come in. - Hey Drew I got a new client for you. - Not now, Bob, I'm booked solid for the rest of the day. - I promise it'll be worth your while. - Alright, show 'em in. But I only have 15 minutes 'til my next appointment. - This is Chloe Brookes, she's looking to receive punitive damages from Ghastly Horror magazine. - Punitive? - Well I was interviewed for an article and ever since then I've been having hallucinations. - Now, she signed a release form, but doesn't have a copy so I figure the publisher's got it on file. - What kind of hallucinations? - I, uh, I imagined I was being attacked and I was positive it was a nightmare, but then I woke up with these marks on my leg. - I thought you'd be interested. - Bob, do you mind if I speak with Miss Brookes alone in my office for a minute? Thanks, buddy. - You won't get in trouble for kicking him out like that, will you? - Excuse me? - Well I noticed that you were the-- - I'm the only minority in the firm. I'm not here filling a quota if that's what you're thinking. - Sorry, I didn't mean it the way it sounded. - I get it all the time. Identity politics. I don't fit into any easy category which confuses a lot of people. I'm no one boys or another one's brother. I guess it makes it hard for them to relate to me. Like the white collar criminals that I represent. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to run off like that, skip it. Let's talk about your problem. Now, I recognized you when you walked in. - Me too, have we met before? - We didn't meet but I saw you in Times Square when you were being interviewed, I'm the third guy from the article. Yeah, and I had one of those hallucinations the other night, too. - Really? What should we do? - Visit the publisher, find out who the author is. - On the article it just says ghost writer. - Yeah, but the publisher will have the guys real name. - What if he won't give it to you? - I'll threaten legal action. - How are you gonna do that? - You don't really need a case to threaten litigation, most people just give you what you want to avoid legal fees. - So much for the policy of not dating fellow employees. - I want you now. - So did you like your sushi? - I loved it, thank you. - You're welcome. Make yourself comfortable. - Okay. Now you can make it up to me. - Huh? - Standing me up at the bar. - Oh yeah, I'm sorry about that. Just let me check my messages. - I don't like to wait. - It'll only take a minute. Hey Drew, it's Bob. Sorry to call you at home, but I can't find that contract. I know I gave it to you, but I don't remember if you gave it back to me after reviewing it. I checked my files, but I don't know where the hell it is, do you have it? Give me a ring tonight. I can pick it up at your place, I just need to show it to Bradshaw in the morning. Hey Drew where the hell are you, man? Bradshaw's been calling me all night for that contract. I can't find it, give me a ring, man. Hey Drew, it's Rich Hanes, you there? Come on, pick up. I know you're screening your calls, what are you doing? Anyway, found a publisher for the book, need you to redo the contract. Give me a buzz, thanks. What really frightens you? End of final message. - Drew? Hey Drew, it's Rich Hanes, you there? Come on, pick up, I know you're screening your calls, what are you doing? Anyway, found a publisher for the book, need you to redo the contract, give me a buzz, thanks. End of final message. - Thanks for staying over. - My pleasure. - Mine too. - You forgot to check for monsters under your bed. - Oh, I'm sorry. Never can be too careful. So what about you? You never told me what really frightens you. - You really want to know? - Of course, I want to know everything about you. - Not everything, a woman's got to keep some mystery to her. - Come on, I told you about my phobias. - Alright. Here's what frightens me, getting old. I just can't see myself as a senior citizen. Even when I dream I'm always younger than I am now. I had this great grandmother who lived to be 98. I can't imagine what I'd look like if I lived that long. I would be a different person, not me. All shriveled up with dark circles under my eyes. - Like a zombie. - Yeah, something like that. I just can't picture myself that way. - Yeah, I guess I wouldn't be too much of a stud at 98 either. - Like you are now, you are so modest. - One of the things you love about me. - Not true. I'm tired, I think I'll turn in. - Turn into what? - A zombie, what else? - I think I'm gonna read for a while, mind if we keep the light on? - No, I can sleep through anything. - Brett, where are you? - Coming. - It's lonely out here. - Be right out. Ow! - I want you now! - Hi, I have an appointment with Drew. Chloe Brookes. - Mr. Evans, there is a Miss Chloe Brookes here to see you. Go right in. - Okay. - Hey, Michelle, did you get that number for Brett Andrews? Bob has it? Alright thanks. Huh? She's a client, that's who. Yeah, Bob. Michelle just said you had that number for Brett Andrews. Are you serious? Bring it right over. - What's the matter? - Sit down, you're not gonna believe this. - What? - Sorry to hear about this, Drew. - What's going on? - Brett Andrews, the other guy from the article committed suicide last night. Jumped out of his own window. - What? Oh my God. Do you thi-- - I don't know. I have to look into it. In the meantime we have to get our act together, we're meeting with Marshal McFarland at 10. - Who? - Publisher of the magazine. - Here they are. - What's this? - The release forms of the people interviewed for the article. As you can see most of them weren't even used. - Uh huh well I guess my first question is who wrote the article. - He prefers to remain anonymous. He uses a nom de plume ghost writer. - Isn't that a little unusual? Our magazine is unusual and. - Well since we're the subjects of the article, I'd like the name of the guy. I mean, I could subpoena you, but I like to avoid litigation when possible. - I don't think you have a case against our publication. - You've got one suicide and my client is suffering-- - We'll take our chances, Mr. Evans. If you want to talk to our attorney, here's his card. - Thank you. You'll be hearing from us. - Good day, Mr. Evans. - Thanks. - Would you get our attorney on the line? We've got a couple of whack jobs. - Taxi! - Wait, what do we do now? - Pay our little ghost writer a visit. - Yeah, but we don't know where he lives. - Well we do now. I lifted this envelope from the folder, has his address on it. - You stole it? That's illegal. - So sue me. You want to find the guy or not? What's it say? - No return name just it's on west 49th. - I know the area. Let's pay a little visit to Hell's Kitchen. Taxi! - This is it. - Wait a minute. - What's the matter? - I know this place. - You've been here before? - Not exactly. This building belongs to a slum lord I'm representing. I thought the address sounded familiar. - What are you talking about? - This case I'm on, it's-- Nevermind, let's check it out. This is it. - What are you doing? - Little trick I learned in the hood. - Hello? - I think it's alright. Have a look around. - Oh. Lovely. - Looks like our ghost writer's been evicted. - Looks like he's been gone for a while. - I'm gonna check out his hard drive. - Smells like he's been gone for a while. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I thought I saw something. - Chloe, look. - He knew we were coming. - He's messing with our heads, let's get out of here. - What now? - I have a friend who's a private detc. If anybody can find this guy, he can. - What should I do? - Go home and just sit tight 'til you hear from me. - Okay good luck. - Did you have a nice lunch with your new client, Mr. Evans? - Come on, Michelle, not now. She's just a client. Alright, it's not what you think. I need you to make some calls, alright? I need to find out who wrote that article and contact some of the people at the magazine, somebody has to know him. Then I need you to call Randy Tucker, he's a private investigator. You can find his number in my address book. If anybody can find this guy, he can. - Okay I'll get right on it. Are we still on for tonight? - Of course. I'll be in my office. - Um, aren't you supposed to be in court right now. - Yeah. I completely lost track of time. I better grab a taxi, I'll see you later. - Yeah. - Oh my God. - Drew! I mean, Mr. Evans. Mr. Bradshaw wants to see you. - Thanks. - Is everything okay? You didn't call me last night. - No, everything is not okay. - What's the matter? - I'll tell you later. - Drew, Drew what is the hell with this case that you're working on? - It's kind of hard to explain. - Well try, we lost the client before she paid. Now you know it is our policy to accept a retainer first. - Huh? - Our Ms. Brookes-- - What are you talking about? - Didn't you hear? She was hit by a truck last night. - What? - This is serious! - No shit. I gotta get that. Hello? Randy? - I did some poking around on your ghost writer friend. - He's not my friend, what'd you find out? - It's kind of peculiar, come check it out yourself. I also got the dope on those guys that attacked you. - I'm on my way. - Drew will you step into my office-- - Later! - What's going on? - I can't talk about it right now, I'll call you. - Told me to follow her so I did. That's what you paid me for. What do you want from me? Come in! Look, I'll call you back later. Guy tells me to follow his bitch, now he's pissed at me when he finds out she's a whore. - What do you got for me, Randy? - Wait a minute. Here's what I found out about those punks that attacked you. Leader's name is Lamont Jamal. - I remember him from high school, used to push coke. Surprised he's not locked up by now. - Not likely 'cause he's dead. - Dead? - Got whacked last year. Same as the rest of them. Drugs, hits, that kind of shit. - I don't believe it, I mean these are the guys but now you're telling me they're all dead? - Kinda weird, huh? This other guys goes under the name of ghost writer, he never cashed the check they gave him. That's his rap sheet, he bit the dust too. Cops found him lying in the alley a couple months ago. They think it was a heart attack. - Heart attack? - Yeah, but they said he had this crazy look on his face like he was, uh-- - Frightened to death? - Yeah, exactly, how'd you know? - Son of a bitch, that's it! He was frightened to death, but if you're not scared then he can't kill you. - What the fuck are you talking about? - If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. - Thanks. You sure you're feeling okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Look, if someone's after you I can help. - You already did. - I can tell this is gonna be one of those fucking days. - You got the balls to come back around here again, motherfucker. - Man, just them shits off. - Yeah, cut the motherfucker's balls off. - What the fuck are you smiling at, huh? - Smiling at you, asshole. - Tough guy, huh? How'd you like to sing soprano? - What really frightens you? - Not you, shit head. - Care to find out? - I'll be right down. - Come out come out wherever you are. - I want you now. - Who's frightened now, motherfucker? - You weren't afraid, I'm impressed. I'll spare your life for now. - Who the fuck are you? - You figure it out. - I'll never be frightened again of you or anyone else. The fuck you laughing at? - Bus should be here any minute. - Excuse me, can't get rid of them. - Have you tried holding your breath. - Does that work? - Sometimes. - Here, it's unopened, try drinking it while holding your nose. - Okay, thanks. You know what? I think it works. - There's something else we could try. - What's that? - Sometimes when something frightens you the shock scares them away. - How am I gonna find something that frightens me here? - I'll think of something, Sara. - How'd you know my name?
