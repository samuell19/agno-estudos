He doesn't tie a tie He wears it! He's ambidextrous like actor Rajini in the film Sivaji! He even tries to write with both his feet at the same time After lunch he takes a power nap for exactly 7 1/2 minutes Even then, he makes use of that time by putting up with unproductive work! Strict orders to Govindhan to cut his nails, shave, tweeze his nostril hair during break Virus is bringing eggs for us All of you come out What is this? - Cuckoo, sir ..And this? Cuckoo's nest Wrong Cuckoo never builds her own nest Do you know where a cuckoo lays her nest? Always in a crow's nest First day and he keeps talking of cuckoos, crows and ciphers! Seems like a bad omen! When the eggs hatch, do you know what happens? Cuckoo's young ones push the crows' eggs down Competition is over Life begins with murder That is nature Compete or die You are like this cuckoo These are crow's eggs that you pushed down Don't forget...every year we get 4 lakh applications to this college Only 200 get selected You are part of the 200 Others are broken eggs My own son applied thrice He ended up as a broken egg Life is a race You've got to run fast Otherwise the one behind you will trample and overtake you Let me tell you a very interesting story This is an astronaut's pen Due to lack of gravity in outer space ball point and fountain pens don't function Many scientists at the expense of many million dollars, have invented this pen This space pen can be used at any temperature at whatever angle One day, when l was a student our director called me Virumandi Sandanam Yes, sir Come here l got scared He showed me this pen and said... 'This is a symbol of excellence l'm gifting it to you The day you find an extra-ordinary student like you, give this to him' l am waiting to do so for past 32 years l'm yet to find such a student At least in this batch will one of you be worthy of this pen? Yes, sir Hands down Should l announce specially for you? Sir, l have a doubt? -ask lf a pen didn't write in space they could have used a pencil! lt would have only cost Rs2!!! Disperse Time for class to begin Oi! He's a real tough cookie! Yesterday, he taught our seniors a lesson Today, he made Virus speechless We must be on our guard with him You gave Virus himself a nasty medicine! Boss, you are great Bless me Get up You're not going to school? lt's your father who pays? Let him go He's just a kid You don't need fees to study in a school Just an uniform will do Whichever school you like get that uniform stitched Sit in that class room without uttering a single word Who will find you out in this crowd? But if they do? Change school and change uniform Did you hear that? He has something...a spark! He looks at ordinary stuff in a totally new perspective ln Virus's cuckoo flock he stood apart as a peacock! We were all professor's robots! He was the only human amongst us What is a machine? What are you rejoicing? My dream from childhood is to become an engineer, sir l am so happy to be here Enough of being happy!

That's what l was saying now ls this what you'll write in your exam? ls this a machine? Up down up down ldiot! Anybody else? Sir? Machines are any combination of bodies so connected... ...that their relative motions are constrained and by means of which force and motion ...may be transmitted and modified as a screw and its nut or a lever arranged to turn about a forearm or a pulley about its pivot etc... Especially a construction more or less complex consisting of a combination of moving parts... ...or simple mechanical elements such as wheels, levers, cams etc V.V.Good! Perfect Thank you sir Please sit down This is what l too said ...in simple terms for everyone to grasp You should then join a Govt. Arts college But we should be able to understand whatever we study, right sir? What's the use of blindly memorizing what's in our syllabus? Oh! So you claim to be more intelligent than these books? lf you want to pass the exams this is what you have to write l just wan... -Get out lf you need to be told in simple terms...get out! ldiot!

Pressure on windpipe resulting in choking They claim he died due to pressure here But he had pressure here for 4 years ls anyone aware of that? Why was that not recorded? Engineers find machines for various needs lf there was a machine to measure this pressure, by now everyone will know ...this is not suicide ...but murder! How dare you blame me for Paneer Selvam's suicide? How are we responsible, if a student cannot handle academic pressure? There are gazillion pressures in life How can you blame someone else for it? l am not blaming you, sir l am pointing a finger at our system l have statistics to prove my point lndia leads as # 01 country in students committing suicide For every 90 minutes a student tries to commits suicide More than ill-health or accident death rate by suicide is higher l am not bothered about all your statistics This is 1 of the finest colleges in our country lt is 32 years since this college was started From 28th rank l've brought it to #1 rank What are your standing in #1?
