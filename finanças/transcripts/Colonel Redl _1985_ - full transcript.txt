COLONEL REDL Colonel Redl's story... is not based on authentic documents. Actions of the characters are entirely fabricated. This film was inspired by John Osborne's play "A Patriot for Me"... and by historical events of our century. Your grandfather was friend of his majesty, The Emperor. The Emperor once asked him... "Well, my friend, what's new?" Like the dew from heaven sent... May on him be blessings spent. May they give the strength for all of his deeds. In all lands may he glory earn... our welfare is his one concern. Woe to those who dare reject... his hand of peace, so circumspect. His holy wrath shall strike them now... with laurels to adorn his brow. Very nice, young Redl. Sit down. Maybe you'll become a great poet of our motherland. I haven't heard such a glorious poem... about His Majesty for a long time. Sir, this is the boy, Alfred Redl. I humbly ask for your support... to help him enter... the Imperial and Royal Cadet School. Always remember to keep a straight posture. We will be so proud of you. And we shall never forget what the Emperor... has done for us. How wonderful it would be... if you would return as an officer. What an honour. Your grandpa was just a poor peasant. And you suddenly get this honour. Never forget that the Emperor made this possible. Always be grateful. Up, down, up, down, up, down... Hands behind your head! Jump in place! Up and in position. Get ready! Attack, defence, go! Redl, Kubinyi! Be careful. You'll get a beating if you break your weapons. Third grade, stop the drill! Line up in two ranks for punishment! Redl, Kubinyi, shirts off! See Redl, it's snowing. Christoph Kubinyi reporting to his grandma... would like to introduce a friend. Harry! Come here, Harry! Don't worry, he just wants to make friends. Good dog. Sit down! Sit down! Tell me Redl, our Monarch's empire is so vast... I've a hard time telling... which of the many people of our Majesty you belong to. - I was born in Galicia. - Polish? No, my father is Ukrainian, partly of German descent. I believe my mother's grandfather was Hungarian. Yes, they were Hungarians. The family was noble but lost everything. Their entire estate. But later His Majesty helped them... and gave them a position in the Civil Service. Fine. Then you certainly have Hungarian blood in you. Yes, my mother would always sing a Hungarian song. A Csitari Hegyek Alatti. He is very nice! He doesn't speak French, grandma. He has to learn it, sweetie. It's as important as horseback riding. But horses are the most important, aren't they? He is charming, your little friend. Come on up, Christoph, it's a good view. Yes, but do I have to climb the tree for that? You smell good, soldier, like a foal. Are you ticklish? Let's see. One, two, three, four... five, six, seven... eight, nine, ten, eleven. Could you please help me? Katalin! What can we expect from civilians... if soldiers act like animals? Is this a zoo? Class raise! - Are you the orderly? - Yes, sir. Who was it? File a report, I want names. I'm sorry, Colonel, I don't know who it was. But I do, Cadet Redl. I know the name. Christoph von Kubinyi. Sir, I'm sure it wasn't him. - Who then? - I don't now, I was singing. Redl, report. Are they the usual gentlemen? Von Freyberg, Galliena, von Gencsy, von Kubinyi? No, it wasn't Kubinyi, sir. Who then? Redl, I'm losing my patience. Then I am forced to expel all four of then... led by Baron Kubinyi... because of this outrageous incident. - I think it was von Gencsy. - Very good, Redl. You'll be a loyal soldier to His Majesty. You are a bright peasant boy. Dismissed! Judas! I am a Judas. I am not a soldier. Those over there are soldiers. I am a treacherous peasant. Colonel Feldhauer wants to see Cadet Redl in his office. Well... I have to tell you something. Redl, you father has died. Here's the telegram. You'll get leave of course. If you should need anything... money for the journey or a wreath for the grave... please tell me. You can count on me. Colonel, may I ask for permission to stay here... I want to take part in His Majesty's... name-day celebration. Now that Emperor Franz Josef the First... has become your godfather and by the bond... of our Holy Church, you have become his sons. Our Father, Franz Josef. You may call him that from this day forward... with humble pride and the right to do so. By the sacrament of confirmation... you're accepted as his sons. This will make the bond between you all... between you and the army... between you and His Majesty even more indissoluble. May your filial gratitude, your filial loyalty... preserve this bond with the Lord God... with your Emperor and your Motherland for all eternity. Why has Detachment D... still not rejoined the main troop? Lt. Schorm! Send an adjutant to find out the reason. I want a report. The medical personnel is still in the valley! Lt. Hidegkuti! I ordered the reserves into action... to break through the enemy lines and occupy section QX. QX, yes sir. Alright, then. Colonel, the enemy lines have been attacked and taken. Good, Redl. You have executed this tactical exercise perfectly. This is a command post, not the Officer's Club... Where we smoke and watch friends play pool. Lt. Schorm. The other ranks out there may not smoke either. Smoking is forbidden on manoeuvres. Carry on. Lt. Schorm, give the order to finish. Yes sir, order to finish. Colonel, I gave Lt. Schorm permission to smoke. That was an error, Captain. Self-control always and everywhere. We shouldn't have compromised... with the Ungarians in 1867. Why not take the whole country... as the English did Ireland? Without that, Austria wouldn't be a great power now. Vienna curbed us, thanks to our politicians. Kubinyi's lamenting the fate of oppressed Hungarians again. But he forgets that Hungary, too... oppresses it's neighbouring peoples. Everything has its price. Arad and Haynau, generals executed like criminals! Come on, Kubinyi... The compromise was a great deed. Redl, you look so sad. - Perhaps because of you. - Don't be sad because of me. Let's drink to the health of Captain Redl. - Let's drink to it! - Do you like him? - Yes, he's very nice. - You hear, old man? She likes you, so drink! Drink from the bottle. What I put in my hand, I put in my mouth. Should I hold it? This Redl was born in Lemberg, wasn't he? And you in Pomerania. - You think it's all the same? - It damn well is! Oh, you are a cosmopolitan. No, Hungarian. Secondly, an officer and Redl's friend. What did His Majesty say? "The Hungarians, a beloved nation!" Are you trying to provoke me? No, why should I? Let's go. Baron, are you being unfaithful to me? Indeed. Jealous? I don't know you yet, but it can soon be arranged. Do you wanna come with me, or prefer to sit and stare? Have you ever done it? Or is your biggest thrill to shout at you soldiers? What's special about Kubinyi that make you all crazy? He not only knows how to do, he likes doing it. - What? - Everything. - Then teach me, too. - You can't teach that. - You have it, or not. - Kubinyi is handsome. And wonderful. What do you like best? His hairy behind? Yes. He has a lovely little rock-hard bottom. And muscular thighs. Just like a little boy. One has something to hold on to. - The scar on his knee? - Yes, I like that, too. How does he do it? Quickly? Slowly? Rough... - or gentle? - Is he gentle? No, he comes in, grabs hold of me and my breasts... and he bites. And I bite him, too. So, he bites? And you? How do you want to do it? Are you really related? Then watch how your big brother does it. It happens during a parade. I'll rode up to colonel von Roden... and report to him on horseback. I said: "One, my mother's parents were Jewish. Two, my father was a Jew from Budapest." Just imagine von Roden's face. At a parade, with all sorts... of distinguished people present. Consuls, Attach√©s and the Goszleth. Daughters, Dominika and Daniela. Alfred, I'll tell it to them straight one day. Don't you think they know you're a Jew? I'm not just a Jew. I'm a Hungarian Jew. We can talk about it, not just in whispers. My father fought for Hungarian freedom and was exiled. My father played cards with the Rabbi of Lemberg. They were good friends. How about becoming a Jew? It would be much simpler. All right, then I'm a Jew. It's all the same. You know, I think your holidays are beautiful. Yom Kippur, Passover... Redl, I'm very fond of you. You're so wildly ambitious. Let's fight about the Goszleth daughters. Would you please look at these drawings. Who do they represent? Or it's hard to identify? You're famous for your observation. This one? Lt. Beatz? - No. - But? - Captain Tannhoffer. - And this handsome face? - Kubinyi. - And him? That's myself. - Continue please. - Dr. Sonnenschein. - Jaromil Schorm. - Schorm? Jaromil? Tell me, this lieutenant here, is he a invert? Excuse me? - I mean homosexual. - Not that I know. Bohemian? Jew? Major, I suggest you to ask him yourself. A straight question will get a straight answer. Your an idealist. This is about debt-ridden officers. Who will protect the army in the event of war? This article appeared in a Prague newspaper... written by one "senior." Do you know who hides behind this name? Your direct inferior, Jaromil Schorm. He belongs to the army, but talks about us. Corruption, debt, cards, booze, whores! He writes that, in the event of war... the army would need protection. Schorm. Senior... Senior! Well... tell me Captain, do you still play the piano? At Cadet school I took lessons with Captain Ruzek. Alright. Keep an eye on Schorm. In due time, I want a report. Tell me... can you make me a list, by this afternoon... of the officers' local contacts? This Schorm! Keep him out of my sight! He will be fired! A disgusting object! Outside the Club other day! This look, this deceit... And you supported him. He provokes me in my own regiment. We absolutely cannot afford... to be exposed to attacks like this! I detest traitors, Captain. Making me sick! Kick him out... or let him go voluntarily. Just get him out of here! You will do that. And one more thing, Redl... tell your friend Kubinyi, to stop his '48 tirades. I don't want any criticism of the compromise, alright? Why does he always mention Haynau when he drinks? Haynau's been dead for years! Haynau is not the Monarchy. We are the Monarchy! And so is Kubinyi. We couldn't object to the articles if they were true. But they are false. I'm ashamed that an officer express himself in this way. He lives among us, accepts the privileges... of uniform and rank, laughs and swears like us... and then it turns out, he's not one of us. Instead of talking to us, he spies on us secretly... and denounces us under a false name. Schorm must face the consequences... and leave those he's betrayed. Taking notes, Schorm? I could dictate for you. Gentlemen, in my own name... and that of the officers regiment... I suggest that Lt. Schorm, at his own request... should leave the regiment and the army. Schorm, I... Go voluntarily. You can state the reasons yourself. Yes. Gentlemen, is this a big moment or a small one? I can't tell. - This is not a cabaret! - You're right, doctor. Brief and soldierly. What's going on? Has our Bohemian gone crazy? Schorm, if you expect a certificate... saying that you've gone insane... which I personally agree, you're mistaken. No! Lieutenant, name your seconds. I consider the desecration of His Majesty uniform... a personal insult. I therefore challenge you to a duel! Shooting? You're near-sighted. Want to fence? But don't confuse fencing with an appendectomy. Don't take this personally, but everybody knows that... doctors who join the army aren't the best ones. Summa cum laude, you jerk. Who will be my seconds? I'm not fighting you. I'm the third-best shooter in the regiment. Allow me to send for my civilian clothes. The duel takes place at dawn. I'll choose my seconds among you. Sonnenschein, I said there won't be a duel. I will take off my uniform. But I can't duel with a Jewish doctor. You're not from whom one may expect satisfaction. And me, Schorm? Do I meet your high requirements? Baron Kubinyi... yes, you do. But gentlemen, this is really... Done! Tomorrow at dawn. With a bullet, since you're such a fine shooter. 3 steps, 3 exchanges. Redl, you're my second. Excuse me. I hate early rising. I'd prefer noon or afternoon. But honour come first. Pistols at dawn, then. - Those articles, Schorm... - I'm sorry. You were such an excellent soldier. The duel is nonsense. - Let it go. - I didn't force it. - Then I'll lock you up. - It's too late, Captain. I'm duelling as a civilian with Kubinyi. Lock him up, if you fear for his life. The army is not dismissing you. You are leaving the army. - In two or three years... - Two or three years? Where will this army be then? It will be at its post and so will I. Do you know what I hate most about this army? Getting up so damned early. - Who's there? Who is it? - Redl. It's you, Schorm. I thought it was you. Sorry. - You're here early. - Yes. I couldn't sleep. - Could you? - I never sleep well. Kubinyi probably sleep like a dog. Don't underestimate him. Cigarette? No, thanks. He overestimates himself. - You are full of energy. - And you? I don't belong with you. What do you mean? I want to remain Jaromil Schorm. I don't understand. I can't take leading a double life... everyone playing their part perfectly. Sickening. All of it. I still don't understand. Tell me, Schorm... are you really a anti-Semite? My grandmother is Jewish. I hope that's sufficient. I shouldn't have insulted him. I just enjoyed keeping that Jew at a distance. - Very possible. - Not really my style. - You play with people. - No, you do. Me? Why me? You're demanding too much of yourself. - What else can I do? - Well, you might be right. Maybe we haven't talked enough to each other. - Why couldn't you sleep? - I don't know. I think I had a dream. - Do you believe in dreams? - No. Or do I? It is cold. Yes. - The weapons? - Here they are. - Redl will tell his dream. - That's not of interest now. - Gentlemen... - Please, go on. I ask you to discuss your disagreement... and use your weapons symbolically. I guarantee complete secrecy. Until then, I shall leave the gymnasium. Redl, stay! Gentlemen, I am ready. I think we must get the doctor. Yes. - Was Schorm your friend? - No, Colonel. If your part in this incident is known... - it will harm your career. - I'm aware of my position. We have decided to act discreetly. Thank you, Colonel. With Kubinyi, it's a different story. He's been in trouble before. However, he survives such incidents more easily. Redl, I must say... you were only a second, but that was a grave error. Never get involved in anything like this again. Yes, Colonel. Do you think an officer without family connections... remains unnoticed? Is that your opinion, Redl? I'm convinced the army seldom allows merit... to go unacknowledged. Correct, Redl, and for obvious reasons. The future of the Monarchy and Europe... - depends on the army. - I've noticed that... officers who complain about privilege... are of average ability, mostly below that. Exactly. A good soldier always recognizes another. That's the basis of comradeship. Redl, as a Commander... I must inform to the War Ministry... about officers of outstanding merit. Your merits have surpassed your present rank. Here's your promotion to Major. And here's your order to report to Vienna. His Majesty has appointed you... second-in-command of a garrison. It's a pity, it had to arrive on this unfortunate day. Nevertheless, congratulations. Thank you, Colonel. It means a great deal to me. After all, I trained you. That's the way it is. A wallet and a briefcase. I had them made in Vienna. A.R. I grew very fond of you, my son. Dismissed! Colonel... I'd like to take Lt. Von Kubinyi with me. He's a good soldier. An odd team, you two. I'm not sure it will help you, but... It can be arranged through his... family connections in Vienna. - Katalin, did you see him? - Who? The Emperor, admiring the view? He has a hunting lodge here. The Emperor! What if we'd stopped to greet him? What would you have said? "Major Redl begs to report?" I'd have wished him good health and a long life. Wait, turn in to the Inn. I'm tired, Major. We'll take a room. I can't believe I saw the Emperor today. Come here. Horse and saddle, a fine soldierly smell. Christoph never smells like a soldier. Do you smell the soldier on him? Me? Here you are, madam. Soldier, uncork the champagne. I've made a lovely, big bridal bed for us. What will your husband say if you don't come home? I'm sleeping at my mother. You're my witness. I've neither time nor inclination... to be a gracious society hostess. I like riding, eating, drinking. Why don't you have any children? We just don't. I can't stand my husband anymore. Shall I marry you? Do you want a pretty Kubinyi? You deserve it. Let's drink. Why do you close your eyes? I don't know. Are you thinking of someone else? Yes. - Christoph? - Yes. Were you always thinking of him? Whom do you love more? Whom? - I'm very fond of you both. - And now? I feel fine, but I don't know for how long. You know, Christoph and I... we're... Actually, I'm afraid of him. - But now you're over him. - No. You're wonderful Katalin. I like touching you. I have nobody I can embrace, just you. Don't forget, you're here in Galicia... not by the Adriatic. We have many Poles, Jews, gypsies, thieves and whores. Be on your guard. Many of them smuggle vodka across the border. We are right at the border, not Bad Ischl or Alt-Ausee. There's so little to do... the officers go hunting for chamois. You get my meaning. Lt. Ehrlich reporting. Manoeuvres proceeding according to plan. Major, Lt. M√©szaros reporting. Manoeuvres proceeding as planned. Throw grenades! Up! Fire! Throw grenades! Up! Stop! Go back! Didn't you instruct your men in the use of grenades... unexploded grenades or those falling short? Assemble the platoon! Throw away your cigarette. Repeat the regulations. I'm sorry, I don't know them all. Not all? Item one? Item two? Three? Five? Your order, officer? - A schnapps, please. - Coming right up, Major. You get many officers here, don't you? - How did you guess? - You knew my rank. You recognize ranks when you're as old as me... but you never know people. I'll get your drink. - And vodka? - No, that's contraband. Maybe a glass of aquavit? We're serving His Majesty on the Russian border. We're not here to impress or chase the women... play pool and get drunk, on duty or on manoeuvres. I'm referring to Lt. Schinszky. Our men blow themselves up... due to a lack of grenade instruction. Lt. M√©szaros is not here to fall off his horse... drunk at 11 am. Contraband vodka, drunk at the Inn... where you go to keep warm, while your men train outside. And by noon you are kept in the saddle by their horses. We are not here to dishonour the Emperor's uniform... by making deals with civilians... like Kferrer and Halmi... getting involved in God knows what. We're not here to seduce a girl a week... meaning raping her in the woods. Like a poor servant-girl who dares not say a word... for everyone would believe the almighty officer. Almighty officers, indeed! Officers of the Monarchy... must set a good example so the people trust us... and know the Emperor will protect them. My question is, does the Monarchy... need each one of you personally... here in this garrison? Answer the question yourselves. I'm waiting. If you think your presence here has a meaning... then you know that with your rights... you have certain obligations. Only then can you claim privileges. You need not be Imperial Army officers. The post office or the railways... guarantees a pension. Colonel Ruzitska wishes to see you in the conservatory. Colonel? I have bad news for you, Redl. When did you last see M√©szaros? This afternoon, during the manoeuvres. - He has deserted. - Really? To the Russians. Tonight at six he appeared on the other side of the barrier. And shouted to our soldiers... "Say 'hello' to Mr. Ruzistka and Redl for me!" And then he did this. I've had enough of the Russians border. I'm applying for retirement. I'd like to recommend you as District Commandant. You have a great future. I was no more than a troop commander. That's fate. One doesn't necessarily have to be on the General Staff. These damned Habsburgs! I hate this Habsburgs, do you hear? I hate them! What do you think of them? Maybe you think they're wonderful. But I'm drunk tonight, so I must tell you honestly. You can have them. I hate them! Galicia and Cracow would join Poland so fast... Vienna would be left gasping. And our Monarchy? It would vanish from the map of Europe. This Empire can only be saved by war. But after so many lost battles... the senile Emperor has to go first. Are you crazy? Trying to play switchman, are you? I'm forced to put you on increased duty for one week. Dismissed. - Yes. - It's Alfred. Are you busy? - What do you want? - To talk. I'm expecting someone who wouldn't like to see you. Duty inspection. - Major, the password please. - "Schenitterin ruht." - Who is the duty officer? - Lt. Kubinyi, sir. Where is he? Where? He fell asleep in the cafeteria. - Why didn't you wake him? - I did. - Why isn't he here then? - He said, sir... he told me to go to hell. I'll take over. A serious breach of duty. At war, you would be court-martialled. - Understood, Lieutenant? - Yes, Colonel. I'm now forced to transfer you. Within 24 hours you'll report to Helmut Haynert... at the War Ministry. He already knows. Your future will be decided in Vienna. Oh, you fools. Dismissed. A farewell drink. I'm almost sorry for you. I wonder if Redl's a Jew... but instead of a caftan, he wears uniform. A great camouflage. Redl will soon be on the General Staff. A Jew on the General Staff?. Our top moron already is in the hands... of the Rothschild family. I didn't thank Redl for this trip. Watch him, he might be useful to us. Go away. Get lost! Go! Go away! What do you want from me? What do you want from me? Major, may I ask you, are you also a Jew? Through your mother? Several people have say so. I also heard, you don't like to mention it. Maybe you're right. I won't tell anyone. My heart's just overjoyed. - May I sit down, Major? - Please. If you excuse me, Major... my wife would like to invite you... to our Friday night supper. Lt. Ehrlich feels quite at home with us, too. A large family and beautiful children, Major. Don't! Don't touch me! I have to warn you, Lt. Ehrlich... and all other gentlemen, including our doctor... that close contact with the Jews is to be avoided. Our supreme Commander, His Majesty... allows Jewish soldiers... to entry into the Officer Corps of the Royal Army. If most comfortable with junk merchants in a caftan... you shouldn't be in uniform. There's something else. Some of the Jews here... no, let's say most of the Jews here... have trading connections with Jews across the border. Vodka, fabrics, God knows what else is being smuggled. We suspect that information is traded as well... gathered from some officer during... the family's gefilte fish dinner. We must decide. Either you're an officer of the Imperial Army... or a Slovak... or a Ukrainian... or a Jew. Dear Sonnenschein, old doctor. I haven't hear from you for awhile. A woman wants to see you. She said she's your sister. - What does she look like? - She's elderly. - Tell her I'm busy. - Yes, sir. Hold on! Send her in. - Alfred? - Soferl! Soferl, what are you doing here? Mother sends her love. We heard you were here. - From whom? - A soldier, Schilhanek's son. Yes, mother sends her love. Ilse and the children, too. Magda has moved with her husband. - Are there any problems? - No more than usual. Something important to tell me? No. Please. You need money? - No. - Take it. I can give you every month. I'll send it to you... or I'll bring it myself. I don't mind. Here. Please don't ever come here again. You can't do that. These are barracks! This isn't like a post office. You shouldn't come here using my name. No. Now I have to... Take it. Put it away. - Christoph is really hurt. - I'm the one that's hurt. He said and did things I couldn't accept... as an officer or his friend. Alfred, don't be ridiculous. Stop lying to me. Stop pretending for your own sake. The concept of the Monarchy is good. I can't imagine anything better in its place. The Emperor's old and makes mistakes. Some reforms are due. But I must show that from where I stand... The Monarchy isn't crumbling, but strong. If a few others felt like me... things wouldn't depend on the old man alone. Then we could save this Monarchy. Everything I can do, I shall do. And what do you want to do? And you wonder why people hate you? I know everything... everything about them. I can strike them down whenever I like. Gentlemen, will you please line up according to rank. By rank, I don't necessarily mean military rank. I assume you know your closeness to Vienna... although that can change. The lower ranks should line up according to height. Short people first. There's no disgrace. The Heir-Apparent isn't tall, either. Neither am I, so obviously no disadvantage here. When the Archduke enters, we stand to attention. Receive decorations, head high. At his handshake, bow your head. You won't lose it just yet. Line up now according to your rank and position... facing the door. They're coming. I'm glad I did transfer you here. I really trust you. The decisive factor was you not belonging... to any fraction. We must do our duty, independently... and do the best of our ability. Your task is to modernize military intelligence. You've done excellent work, but largely as an amateur. From now on, you're the number one specialist. If you have any problems, come to me and I'll help. And when you become War Minister... I'll let raise my pension. Just one more advice. Choose subordinates who have... reason to look up to you. Men who are grateful to you, because you selected them. I welcome you as members of this newly formed office. Please get to know each other. Don't be bothered that you speak different tongues. Your task will be in the provinces... with people whose language you know. Our mutual task is to preserve and protect... the strength of the Monarchy. Whatever we say or don't say in order to reach our goal... is not lie, but our mission. Duty. We must know everything about everyone. The smallest town holds people we need. It's up to us entirely to find them. Suitable types abound, nearly everyone is susceptible. Details of our work are strictly confidential. If you are successful... you'll be praised by nobody but me. Mistakes, nobody will defend you, the same goes for me. But we belong to a group... whose hand is on the pulse of the Monarchy... and can make decisions in its interest. This trust, after long and careful consideration... was lent to you. Lent, not given. As hard as it was to gain this trust... as easy it is to lose it. To lose everything. That's power. Note everything about every officer. Who was he with? Where? What did they talk about? How much they spend, what they like, their passions. Which officers are regular customers. Name, rank and garrison. Redl, Albert. Career driven, concerned only with his own welfare. Likes to be considered an aristocrat. Admires power and often stresses... his gratitude to the Habsburgs. No contact with his family... and sister, resident in Lemberg. Poses. Poses. Insincere. It's not pleasant for me to repeat this question... but Marshall Korad asked me if you're homosexual. And if I think it odd... that even the Archduke has made inquiries. What do you say? They're plotting against you already. Unless it's a plot against me. They don't dare touch me, so they starting with you... because they know that I'm backing you. That's the world around you. Take stock of it. I've got the impression you make enemies easily. Avoid that whenever possible. For my sake, too. You should marry. That would calm people down. I'll introduce you to a girl from a good Viennese family. Or we'll pack our bags and go to America. Should we? We may face an offensive in the Balkans. The Emperor wants peace. He knows what war would do to the Monarchy. Yet he makes bad mistakes. He puts in key positions... men who represent everything he fears. The Archduke works openly against him... and he pretends not to notice. When the Emperor dies... the Monarchy will fall to pieces. Look at this here, from an earlier empire. What does remain? Stop that! That civilian suit is the greatest lie in your life. I know. Are you coming? Of course. Alfred. Yes, I'm coming. Welcome, Lt. Colonel. May I check your uniform, according to regulations? Colonel, your sword, please. Thank you. Kindly wait a moment. - Kubinyi. - Hello, Redl. I thought you were in St. Petersburg. I'm now on General Staff for Hungarian affairs. If you need anything from that area... please come to me first. And if I can do anything... I don't snoop on fellow officers. Take care. Lt. Colonel, His Imperial Highness is expecting you. Imperial Majesty... Colonel Alfred Redl begs to report. Colonel Redl. I'm glad we can have a talk. I've heard so much about you. How do you like your position? Thank you, Imperial Highness. I have a lot to do. And I like to work. Do you enjoy the power in your hands? Sometimes? Just for a moment? What I feel rather is the weight of my task. They say your loyalty is unshakeable... and based on gratitude. You want to serve and prove yourself, am I right? I am deeply honoured, if they say that about me. You're a good toll-collector, then. You won't side with those who've gained eminence... by their noble blood. Are you Catholic? Yes. We understand each other. People say things about me, too. I've read your reports. You write very well. Or rather, convincingly. You like to work hard... like in Galacia, where you proved your ability. We'll see whether you are just as talented here. We have to focus on the interests of our Monarchy. World becomes dangerous. Army morale is shaky. The Imperial Army has begun to resemble a casino... playing pool, drinking and chasing women, right? Yes, unfortunately. The spirit of liberalism undermines everything. Please, sit down. In such a situation... one has to make a clean sweep to restore order. Don't stand there, sit down. The army must be as rock-hard as ice on a frozen lake. Your Highness, fish swim under the ice. We must take lasting examples... as your previous activity proved. We must arrange some actions that will shake the army... to take clear to all that the liberalism must end. The Emperor must see that an effective army... needs a new spirit. In my view, the people of the Monarchy... must be shown a distinct face of the enemy. The picture of a common enemy... who threatens them. The feeling of fear, you see... is the only thing that makes an army tough. Think it over, Colonel. Check your files and submit a suggestion to me, soon. It should relate to the Balkan... and the action of Russian forces. Or possible French. You have full authority. How long have you known Colonel von Komjathy? Since I was in the 32nd Maria Theresia Regiment. Cognac? Grappa? Liquor? What would you like? Cognac, please, if I may. Who are the confidants of Colonel von Komjathy? Komjathy? I'm sorry, I can't remember. Thank you. I thought you were a bright peasant boy. Think it over. Will one afternoon be sufficient... to give me an accurate list... of officers relations in your garrison? The building material contract... for the Przemysl fortress was signed by Ullman. The engineer responsible was Worowka. To whom did you pass on the material? Whom did you hand the material? Where? And how? There are five cases at our disposal, unfortunately... each case amounts to high treason. I suggest we remove a case... from the military court and make it public. With special reference... to the equality guilty environment. We do it so spectacularly... that it creates tension throughout the army... and among the civilian population. I suggest a public trial with press coverage... and many witnesses. The idea is excellent, Redl. It all depends on the person accused. I suggest either the case of Max von Dornheim... or Colonel Gy√∂rgy von Komjathy, from Budapest. Please. Look, Lt. Colonel. This trial must show the army and the officers... that the enemy's in our ranks... and that we'll strike down anyone... who neglects his duty. At the same time, we must show the whole world... a united and strong Austro-Hungarian army. That's politics. So, the accused cannot be Austrian... certainly not Austrian aristocrat. It'd weaken the trust in the leadership. He cannot be Hungarian... since we live in a dual Monarchy. We don't want to irritate the enemy within. Also cannot be a Czech. They keep demonstrating. Too many independence movements. They would see as a provocation. It certainly can't be a Jew. The Dreyfus affair enraged all of Europe. We'd stir up an international storm of indignation... and upset the Emperor's important links... with the Rothschild bank. And finally... no Serb or Croat. That zone is too hot and must be tackled otherwise. You have Hungarian blood in you? Ukrainian. That's what we need, a Ukrainian. Look for a duplicate of yourself, Redl. I'd have to search Galicia. Then look there. Similar background, career and connections. That can't be a problem for you. You have files on everyone... with your wide network of agents. What happened? I'm included in the Archdukes schemes. The bullets are whistling past my ears. Colonel, we have the answer for you. Dismissed. Salapska! Salapska! Were you asleep? I need a special train from the Ministry... and notify Commandant Lemberg... to put Victor Ullman under surveillance. But not open action before my arrival. Immediately. Good evening. - Are you Victor Ullman? - Yes. How can I help you? I must speak to you in private. - Why? - Please come. - This way. - Go ahead. Excuse me. - Salapska. - Andr√°s! Give me the keys to the safe and your desk. - May I have an explanation? - I am searching the premises! I could fabricate evidence and nobody would ever know. But I don't want to. The key. - I won't tolerate this! - Give me the key. Major... take Mr. Ullman next door. I'll interrogate him later. By the way, where's the engineer Worowka? I don't know. In Vienna, I presume. Andr√°s! Take him away. Przemysl. Major, make a list of all firms, all engineers... and their army partners. Possible private contacts aside from business relations. But first a telegram to the Vienna police. "Find and arrest engineer Worowka." - Put it back, please. - Leave me alone. I'll have to handcuff you, if you don't. Stop! Don't move! Stop! Get a doctor, quick! Heir-Apparent. "Christoph Kubinyi, St. Petersburg." Turn right, please. Right, I said. Announce me to the General. The General is retired since yesterday. The chief of the General Staff handles all open cases. Understand. I understand. Please allow me, Imperial Highness... to question Major Christoph Kubinyi. What about? I'm sure that engineer Worowka... and army supplier Victor Ullman... conspired to pass plans of the Przemysl fortress... to Petersburg. Galicia again. Have you arrested them? No. Ullman committed suicide... and Worowka was murdered in Vienna. Once you go into action, death follows. Przemysl. What do you want to know from Kubinyi? If Ullman had any military diplomatic contacts. Tell me, Redl... are you a cruel man? Imperial Highness, I am doing my duty. - What faith? - As I told you, I'm Catholic. - Do you like children? - Yes, but my wife is ill. Excuse the questions. I just wonder why Roden always backed you. Because you graduated with honours... and you're a good mathematician? I see no point in you interrogating... members of the General Staff... or harassing our most reliable men. But this concerns high treason. I shall decide who is the traitor! Przemysl is of minimal military importance. The guilty have sentenced themselves. Case closed. You haven't succeeded this time. A dead duplicate is no duplicate. Spin your web better and do it faster... or will von Kubinyi replace a Ukrainian? - He's not like you. - But you misunderstand me. I don't misunderstand you. Open your eyes when you look for the enemy, Redl. You're not senile yet... like this Roden with his watery eyes. Whom we finally managed... to put into well-earned retirement. You admired him, or not? Your Highness, he indeed was a bit emotional. Look, Redl. The Emperor's Waltz isn't danced anymore. War is coming. Can we avoid it? Maybe. However, the Monarchy needs a spectacular case. A bit of a fright. A few days of threat and fear, then a quick victory. War, then? A retaliation for some assassination. Then a small, local war for a couple of weeks... to save what can be saved. Mr. Redl. This profile an extremely ruthless type. But something about it suggests sensuality. - Slavic face. - Yes, the cheekbones. Looking at this photo, clearly a brutal personality. Lt. Colonel Redl. First we'll promote him. The whole thing is monstrous treason. The Archduke plans a military coup, to seize power himself. He doesn't believe in the old Monarchy. The only one who does is the Emperor. I hate politics! I hate politicians! My world, yes, my world. Today I wish it would fall apart. A quick hero's death. Done. Then we're even, the Monarchy and I. I'm forty. Do I admit that I've been on the wrong side... when all other possibilities are just as miserable? Nothing matters, Alfred, only life itself. To breathe this wonderful morning air. It's no sin to be involved. It's a sin to remain involved. Montaigne. I learned it in my French Class. Why do you keep this? - I wanna know what he thinks. - About you? I can't prevent what's brewing up. What I wanted to defend doesn't exist. I dreamt my father sat on my shoulders... pressing me into the earth. You no more about me than anyone else. If you ever misuse that... I'll shoot you. Colonel, it's a masked ball. Even for me? Yes, until midnight, for everyone. Colonel Redl, whom we all tear. And your wife? Unfortunately, in a sanatorium. - May we ask why? - A shadow on the lung. I wish her a speedy recovery. Good evening. If there were an explosion in this room now... it'd be the solution for Europe. And would we be inside or outside? Trieste will fall to the Italians, so don't buy it. Every battalion's safe has an envelope... with the secret mobilization order. Colonel Redl? What do you say to that? I heard that Austria-Germany, not Hungary... will save the Habsburgs. Katalin, dear... excuse me. Would you introduce that Esterhazy to my daughter? We'll meet later. Yes, but the Germans are in Silesia. The Ukrainians will join the Russians. They prefer the Tsar. I couldn't think of any other reaction from them. Pardon me. Long live to the Habsburgs, even it if might not be long. And to the army of course. It is midnight. All masks are falling! Alfred, may introduce our new guest. - Tenente Velocchio. - Alfredo Velocchio. Redl. The most important thing for me is... that you love me... protect me and trust me. All my life I've been weak. I need your help. Tell me what to do. Tell me how to be. Cynical, maybe? Why cynical? You don't believe in the whole thing, but you go on. You said war is coming, but you'll lose it anyway. Am I supposed to seize power? Enough officers share my views. Should we support the Emperor... who is old and may be dying? It's the war we should stop. Or... a bullet from this pistol might be the solution. No, there is a better way. - Who sent you? - Excuse me? Who sent you? The Italians? Russians? French? English? Who? I don't know who. I'm getting 12,000 crowns for it. For what? I'm supposed to get military secrets from you. They're most interested in the plans to attack Russia. Over. The code letter for war with Russia is "R". Yes. R. On the northern front there are 788 battalions. 377 cavalry squadrons. 379 batteries with 2,222 guns. 69 technical companies. 6 companies of bicyclists, 1,234 machine guns. Understood? In the fortresses Lemberg, Cracow, Przemysl... 22 battalions. 7 cavalry regiments. 1 battery with 6 guns. 83 artillery regiments. And now get lost. From where did you know Alfredo Velocchio? I didn't. I met him that night in October. Who introduced him to you? - I forgot. - Think. Who was it? Who told you to introduce him to me? - Excuse me? - Who commissioned you? No one. He asked me to introduce him. - What did he say? - Nothing. - You're lying. - I'm not. You're lying! I swear, he mentioned Christoph. Why don't they arrest me? What are they waiting for? They need a Ukrainian. Our Father... who art in Heaven... Perhaps I should have tried this earlier. Thank you. Salapska. Colonel, we must speak to you. Come in. We have orders to disarm and arrest you. Which is Colonel Red's room? First floor, number 71. He has officers visiting already. Major Salapska reporting. This way. You'll be court-martialled for passing military secrets. The court-martial will decide your fate in an open hearing. - I've been provoked. - No, we were! Since you were in Fiume, you've been a traitor. The Archduke chose me because our friendship... and your relations with my sister... make you part of our family. He asked me to deliver his message to you personally. Behave properly in court and admit the charges... then the sentence will be light. Or you'll be sentenced for treason and betrayal. Betrayal. Is a national virtue nowadays. I'm sorry we're meeting again like this. If it's any consolation, some people know... and I've told them... no officer has been more reliable than you. Alfred, I really would like to have your child. Do what you're expected to... and nothing will happen to you. Haven't you noticed that no one's on your side? Nobody but me. Children? Now... I don't like children anymore. They telegraphed me to come here from Fiume. May I? How do they know we were friends? They know everything. - Did you betray secrets? - Not the way you heard. Then stand up in court and defend yourself. The court only accepts evidence that can be proved. The Emperor would never allow an unjust verdict. If the charge is false, they can't take the uniform. They'll take yours, too, if it suits them. They might need a better scapegoat soon. Then it'll be your turn. The Jews. The simplest solution. Popular, too. None of us will be wearing this uniform much longer. I converted to Christianity, you know that. And what shall I do? My grandfather... Doctor Ignaz Sonnenschein, always said... "Lord, you didn't make me Moses or an Emperor. So you can only hold me accountable... for being Doctor Ignaz Sonnenschein all my life". Tell them what they want to hear. It's just another year or two. I dreamed about you. I walked in darkness and you showed me the way out. We should live together. We're talking about the head of Intelligence. He was the head, Captain. Is that clear? Yes, sir. But Colonel Redl was my superior. Didn't you ever notice anything about his behaviour? Yes, Colonel. His will to work. He rarely slept or ate, just kept working. Gentlemen... Remain seated. How are the trial preparations? He won't cooperate. I'd have this traitor shot. The paper could call it an accident. He was run over or fell out of a hotel window. Then a military funeral. I'm not sure yet what's best for the Monarchy. No other aspect matters. Well, gentlemen. Solution 1: an open hearing. But Redl won't cooperate. - Correct? - Yes, Your Highness. Not to mention that Redl has a lot of information... which he might disclose at the trial... with unpleasant results. Solution 2: a closed hearing. Sentence made public after execution... in such detail that it alarms the whole army... and also the whole civilian population. Do you agree? Whoever agrees should raise his hand. Lt. Colonel Kubinyi, you don't agree? Imperial Highness, I beg to reply, no. What do you suggest? Redl should have the chance to decide his own fate. You were his school friend, hence prejudiced. Principally, you're right. How can Redl decide his own fate? He won't even agree to a public trial. We're speaking of a traitor. One can only deal with a traitor when he's dead. I won't inquire how this man... managed to get into the Ministry. Who backed him, or whom he deceived. These questions will be answered later. For the people of the Monarchy... we're dealing with an officer... in the Imperial War Ministry. So, I suggest he should be allowed to end it himself. And we can publish the version acceptable to us. A third solution. What is the public told in this case? He picked a certified letter, two detectives saw him... he was captured trying to escape... and committed suicide. Yes? Your Highness, in this case... journalists will insist on details. He might have torn the envelope... and mislaid the pieces or left it in a car. Or his penknife he used to open the envelope... or the penknife case. Very good. It should be published like this. I suggest it's not published like that. It should leak out. But not in Vienna. In Lemberg, Budapest, or Prague. Let some bright reporter uncover it. We just plant the clues that lead to Redl. We should check a list of all journalists in Prague. Any counter-suggestions, gentlemen? I also think this is the best solution. Lt. Colonel Kubinyi... your opposition led to this solution. You'll visit Redl, as an old comrade... and hand him your service revolver. Your Highness, I can't perform this task. An officer cannot take action against a superior. By the grace of the Emperor and by my own decision... I promote Lt. Colonel Kubinyi... to Colonel of the Austro-Hungarian Army. My orders takes effect immediately. Colonel... you know how to use the weapon. You will have a moment, but please be brief. Then there is no trial. Is there anyone you wish to say goodbye to? Make sure you get out of here, quickly. A briefcase and matching wallet, leather... with the monogram A.R. Eighty crowns. One bid for eighty. - Ninety. - One hundred. - One hundred... - A hundred twenty. One hundred and twenty. Going once, twice, sold! Next a child's poem, handwritten. "Dedicated to our Emperor and King. Like the dew from Heaven sent... may on him be blessings spent. May they give the strength he needs... for all of his majestic deeds. Alfred Redl, elementary school pupil."
