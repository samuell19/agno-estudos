(dramatic atmosphere music) He's too strong. He's too strong in my mind. I gotta stop my old nemesis. I've gotta stop him. (maniacal laughter) [Prisoner] Shut up! Shut up! (maniacal laughter) Fucking assholes, man. I've got to get to the other side. 'Cause he's living inside me. I can't get him out of my head. Hey shut up over there! I gotta get more strength. Gotta do it now. Gotta do it now. (metal clanging) The time has come, he's too powerful. Gotta get him out of me. Gotta fight him on the other side. Time to die. Not! (hooting) (maniacal laughter) So long, motherfucker! Fucking creep! (alarm ringing) (prisoners screaming and laughing) [Security Guard] (mumbles) fucking hung himself, let's go, get up there, let's go, come on, how'd he get out of his cell? [Security Guard 2] I don't know, I told you to watch him. Come on, call down the infirmary, get a doctor, let's go! (mumbles) come, let's go! It's good to see you go, motherfucker! [Security Guard] Get the doctor right now, you get downstairs! (mumbles) get him out of his cell, come on! Shit! I told you to watch this guy, man. Come on, get him out of here. Come on, come on. [Doctor] Take your time, I don't think this guy's gonna make it. [Prisoner] Is he even breathing? Sure doesn't look like it, put that on him. Stick this thing in, give me a little piece of tape will you? [Prisoner] Yeah. We're wasting our time, I don't this guy's gonna make it. You ever revive a guy before? [Prisoner] Nah. Put your hands right here, just try that. [Prisoner] Like that? Yeah. That's too hard, you gotta place your hands like this. [Prisoner] It do anything? So how long are you in here for? [Prisoner] Two more years. Really? Got any plans when you get out? You cannot escape me by death! If you run, I will find you. Only in defeat will I submit. Only in victory can you die. (maniacal laughter) (grunting) (demonic growls) (ominous atmosphere music) (death groan) Come on, guy. (screaming) Yes! Yeah! All-fucking-right! (grunting) All right, we're gonna take you down to central booking, they're gonna do your paperwork. [Sassy Woman] What, are you gonna dust his dick for prints? Bullshit man, you ain't got shit on me. I ain't going nowhere. I told you my friend asked me to take a ride in his car, now how I'm supposed to know it's stolen? Shut up, you little monkey. Hey Mick, I'm booking this kid on a 227, grand theft auto. That's an A-felony, don't think it'll stick. Best you can do is a C-misdemeanor, unlawful entry. Yeah that's right, a C-misdemeanor, you ain't got shit on me. Oh no, fuck that, we caught him in a stolen limo dead to rights. What about the accomplice, it says something here about a... Ah he's a fast little fucker, he got away. Yeah, what about my homeboy? Oh, I mean I ain't even know him. Look Heany, any good lawyer's gonna lay an unwilling accessory rap on the kid. That's a class B felony. Let's make a deal time, plea bargain down to C-misdemeanor, I mean what's the fucking point? DA's gonna throw it out, why waste your time with it? No you look, McCardle. I caught this little piece of shit and I'm booking him on an A-felony. You can't do that. Perp is under 16, you guys gotta read criminal procedure law. No, fuck this, come on, he's gonna be back on the streets tomorrow and you know it. Whose side are you on anyway Mick? I don't make the laws, Heany. Since I'm the only guy who can read around here, you guys have learned to count on my Solomon-like wisdom. Yeah, Solomon! You need to learn to read like Solomon. Shut up, shut up! You know, I don't know how anybody could wanna work with you anyway. I don't know why anybody would wanna work with you anyway. (dramatic synthesizer music) Peggy, give us a moment please? I'll be right back. Everyone noticed you weren't at the service at Saint Anne's. There were 2,000 cops there. I didn't think I should be there. Look, kid, there are certain things you're gonna have to deal with. These kind of things happen in our line of work, you've got to let life go on. I killed my partner, Tony. You shot and killed Brandon Sullivan by mistake. It was an accident. An accident that happened in a very fucked up situation. Now you gotta worry about you, you understand? Your ass is gonna get the credit for finding the Mirror Man to Brandon. The dead hero cop bullshit. Look, it's what the public wants to hear. What you gotta be concerned about is you gotta ride out strong. I'll do the best I can. I'll try to keep your job. Thanks, Tony. [Heany] I don't know why anybody would wanna work with you anyway. ♪ There's an old rugged cross ♪ The symbol of suffering and shame (ominous atmosphere music) Thanks for stopping, man.

Is there a gas station around here you can give me a life to? Yeah, I can give you a lift to the fill-in station, but I can't bring you back. My man. By the way, my name's Ernie. My name's Trax, Mark Trax. You know Ernie, I gotta tell you, I've lived a very tortured existence up 'till now. You know why? [Ernie] Why? I see things people don't see, I know things people don't know. I want you to understand this Ernie 'cause you're a reason person. I haven't talked to one in a while. Well you gotta get out more often. [Mark] What's that on your belt? It's my knife. What does it look like? Can I hold it? Hell no, that's a bad question to ask a man.

(ominous atmosphere music) (sirens wailing) [Reporter] Details here on the scene are sketchy at the moment, but apparently an escaped mental patient, Mark Trax, hijacked this vehicle after killing a local resident and then perished himself in this bizarre accident. On the action cam you can see the scene at the Maximum Security Institution where Trax was to have spent the rest of his life. Trax allegedly killed a doctor after a faked suicide attempt and escape some hours ago. Mickey, your dinner's getting cold. Mickey! (gunshots) Mickey, your goddamn dinner's getting cold.

Look honey, I just checked, there's no Tiffany O'Brian on the list, it's $10. I can't believe you're making me pay. Well if you don't wanna pay then leave. Fine. Thank you very much, have a good night. Slut. (rock music) Hey Leo! Pipe down, will you? I'm half fucking deaf already. Hey, what's up Tiff? Not much, what's going on? Hey Jim, can I have a nice cold one? Nothing's going on here, there was two bands before Beezle Bop and I don't know what's going on with Molly. There's nothing cool happening here you know, this place sucks. I know, it really sucks because I could be at some other shows taking pictures of some band making the bucks. Did you check this guy's ID? Nah man, you got ID? Yeah I got ID. Hey what the hell is this? Leave the liquor outside. Can't come in with that. Did you get his money? Yeah man, right here. All right, go on in. I want you to watch for that. I make my money at the bar. - Sorry. Oh yeah, you do that picture thing. Yeah. I've got a new career myself. That's too bad. Why? I can still get you your dope. Do you want some now? It would be so totally awesome, yes, yes. All right listen, I gotta go check on him and make sure he isn't stroking (mumbles). Listen, just stay here and I'll be right back, okay? Don't move, I'll be right back. Okay. Hey Jim, pick it up huh? Move it. Get the beer over the bar and into people's hands. That's how we're making money, come on, move it huh? Hey. Lyle, how you doing, good to see you. Oh it's such a long time. Yeah, coming in to check out the act? Oh yeah, I'm bringing everybody with me. Gonna have the photographer in here, we're gonna shoot this place into the next issue. All right, hey Jim, comp everything for Lyle! [Lyle] Oh thanks. Years ago, Mark, it would've been you on stage. You were very black. All right all right, we've had enough of that. So you're gonna do a little write up on this place? Sure, sure.

I'm not here to see the band, I'm here to see you. No, I'm serious, okay? You gotta get out, all right? Come on, man. No really, get out of here. Get out. You're not gonna shake my hand? No man, I'm not. Get out of here. Destroy the lost souls for they do not know! Hey, I'm flattered, okay? I really am, I'm flattered, you're a nice guy, but get out of here before I have to call the bouncers. (demonic laughter) Hey, I'm flattered, but you gotta get out of here. You feel that? It's death. You feel death slipping right into you? And life slipping out? There are ways to get out of this chokehold. You never learned them. You know why? You wanted me to do this. You wanted me to come and do this. What do you think? (demonic growling) Yeah, we agree. (demonic laughter) (rock music) (screaming) You gonna mope around all night, McCardle? Yeah Mick, you haven't said a fucking thing all day. What's the matter, you and Peggy have another fight? We've got a lot of issues. Well if that's the way it is, I can't wait to get married. Well it's not all peaches and cream you know. Just ask Mick here, you know? I mean if you stay married long enough to somebody, you turn into a different person. Hey Heany, did you make it with that nurse last night? Nah, she hates me. Well Louise said she saw you talking to that young thing. Fuck you. Hey get this, she works over at Saint Catherine's right? So last night the bus brings this vic in, was stabbed down in the lower east side in one of those joints. DOA, no chance. It wasn't really just a stab, it was more like some kind of sacrificial ritual or something. Know what she said? She said that the body had no blood left. [Officer] Shit. You gotta be kidding me. That's nothing, you ready for this? The guy was beheaded or something. Like with an ax. (deathly groan) The perp carved this guy's eye in, jammed something in there or something. I don't know, whatever, I wasn't really paying attention at that point. [Officer] That's disgusting. That's why they call it Fun City. [Officer] Probably gonna be another serial killer. (deathly groan) (maniacal laughter) (dramatic atmosphere music) (metal clanging What is your problem, you're getting that weird look in your eyes again. Tony, I called you 'cause we gotta talk about something. There's some weird shit going on. The Mirror Man's back. It's been 10 fucking years, pal. Look, don't even bother me with this shit. I hear things. I know Mark Trax escaped, but he's dead. They got the (mumbles) town medical examiner's signature on the death certificate, end of story. Tony, you gotta believe me, he's out there. I know it. I feel it. Look, don't give me that mumbo jumbo, you're just goddamn lucky everybody in the fucking department has forgotten about your little problem. What do you wanna dredge this whole thing up again for? If he's out there, you want me to just sit here and not do anything? All right, let's just say for a second I believe you, okay? You're a good cop Mickey, but you're out of your fucking mind if you're gonna put your neck out on the line for this. Nobody gives a shit, nobody cares anymore. Look, do yourself a favor, just lay low, do your job, don't piss anybody off downtown, put in your 20 years, collect your fucking pension. That's what it's all about. You don't believe that, Tony. Oh yes I do, my boy. Times have changed. You've been so busy doing the dog you don't know. You can't do your job anymore without breaking some goddamn patrol procedure or some department manual procedure. You put guys away, you do years on the job, it don't mean a shit, you're gone. It's not fair, but that's the way it is. I'm gonna go down to One Police Plaza. Talk to Manhattan Zone Commander. That is the stupidest thing you could do, Mickey, you're not gonna get anywhere with a shine like Charlie O'Holgan. He's got his head so far up the police commissioner's ass you need a bullhorn to talk to him. I'm gonna work with Homicide on this, Tony. I think I understand the guy. I've been seeing his face for I gotta do this. I gotta do this for Brandon. Hey Mick, did you catch the latest on the Mirror Man? What? He just iced some teenage girl in a club down on the Bowery. You're kidding me. Yeah, a teenage girl, can you believe it? Hacked her up real good. Wasn't in the paper, where'd you hear that? I saw it on the city wide teletype. Where? In the sergeant's office. Brandon, you're gonna get in trouble. Hey, how am I supposed to get ahead around here? What you need is information, that's what it's all about, and I'm telling you something. If you wanna make detective, you better learn that right away. I bet if you bagged the Mirror Man you'd get your gold shield. Yeah right. I'll tell you something, I'd like to kick his ass. Bullshit. The guy's real scary, he's a real sicko. You wanna know something, Mick? I'd fucking kill him. (gunshot) (death groan) I'd fucking kill him. (dramatic soft rock music) Well now, McCardle. What can I do for you? Actually, do you have a minute? Not really, no. I had a few ideas about the Belmont homicide. An idea? What do you mean? It matches a certain profile. That's for sure. Well thanks a lot, I'm sure the task force detective assigned to the case will really appreciate any information you can supply them. Actually I wanted to request a temp transfer to Homicide. Oh McCardle, you and every other gold shield in the NYPD. You know, membership in that squad is just slightly oversubscribed, now we really appreciate you and... I think I know who the perp is. McCardle, what's the matter? Safe and Law squad not glamorous enough for you? Look, you are damn lucky just to have your tin at all, and you have no one to blame but yourself. Oh hell, look, everybody knows you got a raw deal. You got crucified by Internal Affairs. You just should've got command discipline and that's all, but there's nothing can be done about it now. The killer is Mark Trax. Jesus Christ, you are out of your fucking mind. The guy is dead. His tent sheet came over the wire city wide. He broke out of prison, stole a car, and piled it up. He didn't die in the crash. They found his body. He fixed it, made it look like it was him. Oh please, why am I talking to you? Did anybody from state police bother to check dental records? Of course they did. How do you know? Because it's procedure, they got good people at SP. You know, you have got brass balls coming in here and bothering me with this bullshit. I think you should listen to me. Will you get the hell out of here, McCardle? (dramatic synthesizer music) (rock music) Something I can do for you, slick? Oh man. What's the trouble, officer? No trouble, listen, I'm just doing some followup. Anybody here that might've been around the other night? A regular who might've seen something? Man, I don't know nothing, all right? People come in and out, a lot of people, how am I supposed to know? The faces... Shut up. Well you know, come to think of it, little redhead in the back, name's Tiffany O'Brien, she's here all the time. She's some sleazebag band photographer, now why don't you go ask little tramp yourself? Maybe she can help you out. In back? Yeah, red hair, has a camera. Smile real pretty all right? Do the right thing. (rock music) Smells like good dope in here. (laughter) Out. You sure you're a cop and not just a pervert with a bathroom authority thing? Very funny. Ow. Listen wiseass, I'm in the kind of mood tonight where any wrong answer's gonna piss me off. Whatever you're on, I assume you got enough drugs on you for a nice little narcotics rap. No, no, I was just joking. All right, we're gonna play a little game. I don't like the answers I get, I'm gonna search you. All right, sounds fair, sounds very fair. Okay. You here the night the owner was killed? No, I wasn't, I told that to the other policemen, all right? The bouncer says you were here. He said that? Well I didn't see anything all right, I was working. You were working, what do you mean you were working? I was taking pictures, look, I gotta go, this band's paying for this roll of film, all right? Wait a minute, you took pictures at night? Yeah, maybe. So you might've gotten a shot of people at the club right? Actually I did. Wait a second, you know what, I think I got a real tight closeup of the owner being, you know, choked out. Very fucking funny. You got any photos, that's evidentiary material and we can subpoena that. Okay, but let me just get rid of this roll of film all right, I can't let the band down okay? Okay, I'm sticking right with you, all right? Okay. (rock music) Hey Stuart, you better flush the heroin down the toilet, we got an uninvited guest. I wouldn't be surprised. What happened to Stigmata? The band sucks. My mom asleep? Yeah. I'm Detective McCardle, I wake you up? Nah, I just got finished with a mega workout. I was just doing this new thing with my lats. Can we develop the film now? Yeah all right, watch Elvis all right? Mom's got an obsession with him among other things. Let's go. [Mrs. O'Brien] Tiffany, what's wrong? Nothing ma, go back to sleep! [Mrs. O'Brien] I just got to sleep, what are you doing to me? Ma, what am I doing to you, all right? I'm talking, what's the big deal all right? Go back to sleep! [Mrs. O'Brien] What are you doing at this hour? What am I doing to her? [Mrs. O'Brien] How can I sleep when you're talking? Mom, you're eavesdropping, it's your fucking fault, if you weren't listening you wouldn't be hearing anything, all right? Just leave me alone! [Mrs. O'Brien] You're sick, you smoke pot in this house, you belong in the hospital! [Tiffany] Ma, go back to sleep and leave me alone! You smoke pot in this house? So what? She doesn't know shit. 'Cause I could use a collar. Oh like a big pot bust is really gonna make your career, I mean at this point I don't even care if you arrest me. Come on. [Mrs. O'Brien] Tiffany, bring mommy her medicine! That guy lives here with you? Yeah, so? (ominous atmosphere music) So you're looking for the killer right? Brilliant. Can you blow up one of these? Yeah, you gotta pay for the paper though. Fine. You're not married to him are you? [Tiffany] Yeah right. [Mickey] What does your mother think about that? My mother doesn't think. (dramatic atmosphere music) Hey hey, careful, careful. Do you want me to print it light or what? (loud reverberating boom) [Mrs. O'Brien] Tiffany! What are you doing? Want me to arrest her? You know, I don't even care if you shoot her at this point, I really don't. [Mrs. O'Brien] What's going on? Ma, I'm not doing anything! [Mrs. O'Brien] Why are you doing this to me? Stewart! I'm gonna keep this, okay? [Mrs. O'Brien] Be a dear and bring me my medicine. Thanks for your help. I'll keep in touch.

Can I talk to you about your son? Anybody contact you? Did you hear what happened? I know you. You were at the trial. You were sitting there making up lies about my son! You lied, all of you! You all lied about Mark! I was the arresting officer. Your son was a very bad person. Do you know what they did to him? They sent him to prison. Do you know what they did to him there? Do you know what he did to those 10 people? He did not! My poor little Mark. Listen lady, it doesn't really matter anymore does it? I mean he's dead right? The people from Social Services called. They said Mark died in a car crash, but my Mark was a very good driver. Why they're all crazy. It's all bullshit. What are you saying? He used to drive my car all the time, but then the police took it away and they never brought it back to me and it's been 10 years. How much of this bullshit do I have to take before I get my car back? What are you saying, lady? Is he back? Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but leave him alone. You've done enough to him already. It's your fault he is the way he is, now get out! Get out! It's your fault! Can't get you off his mind! Get out of here and leave him alone!

Actually I don't think I have to get in the car. Just get in the car. This is your car? This is a pretty fucked up car. You should've seen it in '79. I had a few more thoughts about this case. Mind if I ask you a few questions? All right, if you wanna bug me with more questions though you gotta do me a favor, all right? What? You gotta drive me somewhere. Where? Just drive and I'll tell you when to make a right turn, okay? What's up? What's up? Come on, give me the money. Hey man, this is a really light bag. Well fuck you then, you came here to fucking blame me or what? No, it's just you usually give me twice as much. Hey look, can you afford the five dollars? No... Then take the shit and go. Come on, man... Listen bitch, I am sick and tired of you coming here every fucking day and giving me a hard time about the shit that I'm selling you. Let me tell you something else. What? My problem is that I fucking need a real piece of ass. No man, come on. I need a new fucking bitch. I could use a nice piece of ass. You're fucking buying drugs? Hey who the fuck are you? Hey get the fuck off my spot. You ain't nobody I'm afraid of, jack. Nobody. (groans) By the way, you're under arrest. Why the fuck didn't you tell me he was a cop? Hey man, I think you oughta let him go. What? This guys was gonna have a little fun with you. Yeah I know, I know, you beat the shit out of him all right, that's enough for me, could you just let him go? Your lucky day, pal. Why are we stopped here? It's a junkyard, we got to look for an old car, it's the only lead I have. You know, this is stupid, I'm driving around in the middle of fucking nowhere with a fucking cop who's asking me stupid questions. How do I know you're not just some pervert who likes me? I don't think you have to worry about that. There's something you should know. There was another murder last night. Very similar circumstances. The guy was also mutilated. Both these guys were in the music business. Baylor owned that shithole club and this guy was a songwriter. You hang out with these types, I figured you might know them. What's his name? His name was Buster Hyman. Oh get out of here. I mean I certainly do not know everybody in the business, and I don't know anybody named Buster Hyman. It's the only lead I have, I thought I'd ask you. I think I know who the killer is. The guy's been incarcerated for 10 years, he just broke out of prison. No shit. What was he in for? Murder. Multiple murder. The guy killed 10 people in 1979. Wait a minute, how come the whole department's not working on this thing? 'Cause no one believes me. Oh great. What are we doing in this place anyway, all right? The least you could do is let me know. This place is disgusting. Oh all right, (mumbles). [Mickey] The guy might've seen you snapping pictures at the club. [Tiffany] Don't scare me, man. This is the fucking car. This was a stupid idea. This is the guy's car? Actually it's registered to his mother. There's shit in here. (glass shatters) Hey! Rock Magazine, it's the Kiss cover, I got this issue. Big fucking deal. Oh excuse me, I'll let you know when I find a Frank Sinatra magazine, all right? Come on, let's get out of here.

You are suspended, and this time lad I am personally gonna see your badge taken away. Now the PBA will supply you with a lawyer or you can get department council. Is that clear? Turn in your badge, McCardle. And your sidearm. Actually Chief, I'm not wearing a sidearm today. What do you mean you're not wearing a sidearm? It's regulations. I'll turn it in to the proper police office. Add that to the specifications will you? McCardle, get the hell out of here. Suspension? Well it could be worse, you could be here. Whatever they want, I don't give a shit anymore. Oh come on, a man dies, you don't give a shit anymore? Tony, I saw him yesterday. All right, something happened yesterday, I mean the impound lot looked like a war zone, but you didn't see him. Tony, I saw him yesterday okay? I've been seeing his face for It was him. Jesus Christ Mickey, that fucked up kid was 16 years old when he was sent up, his face would've changed, you didn't see him. Tony, I saw him. You never forget the eyes. I had a chance to kill him yesterday and I fucked it up. Listen, we'll go to the PBA, I know some people. Fuck it, I don't have the time. Mickey! Mick! Mick! What, Tony? Will you wait for me? (boat horn blows) Where have you been? I haven't seen you for two days. My parents were expecting us at their anniversary party, but forget it. Lay off, I had a rough day. I've had a rough day! Oh really? Well I just got suspended, I'm off the job. What? What does this mean? Does this mean you lose your pension and benefits? What about the PBA, I mean can't they help? You pay all that money in dues every year! (dramatic piano music) (doorbell rings) Hi, I'm Tiffany, is Mickey McCarthy here? McCardle. Who is it? It's Tiffany! Let her in. How'd you find my house? The cop that drove me home gave me your office number, then after bugging them all day I finally got your home address. How you feeling? Like shit. How's the security guy, he didn't look too good. That's cause he's dead. May I have a word with you? What is that little whore doing in my home? Shhh, keep your voice down, she's not a whore, it's a police business thing. You told me you were kicked off the force. I was. Why are you doing this to me? You're humiliating me in my own house by that cheap tramp! I am going to my mother's and I don't care if I ever see you again! That's your wife? Sorry man, that's fucked up. Nobody asked you. Mickey, I brought the issue of Rock Magazine. [Mickey] Big deal. There's something you gotta look at. Bango, page 53. The band's name is Warriors of the Inferno. They were big for a couple months, you-know-who's under the makeup. What am I looking for? Real the caption. Warriors USA Tour '79. Mark Baylor, Buster Hyman, Vince Capeti. Two down, one to go. Fuck. I know, after I found this I couldn't sleep, I'm so totally pumped, I'm playing detective or something, so I'm running around to eight different record stores so I could find their only album Feel the Wrath. I mean they only have it on cassette. How much do I owe you? 10.98, it's pretty rare obviously. Let's go inside and listen to it. No no no, hold on, we don't got to. I've got speakers on my walkman. (rock music) ♪ We are the children of the inferno ♪ Our lives are formed in the crucible of despair ♪ We band together with the warrior's code (doorbell ring) Who is it? It's Detective McCardle, is Tiffany there? No, she went looking for you. All right, can I drop something off for her? Um... Yeah, yeah sure, come on in. I thought you said you were Detective McCardle. I said I was his partner didn't I? No, no you definitely said you were him. You don't look like a cop. Yeah, I'm like Serpico. Yeah, undercover. I wanted to be a cop, but I missed the test. That's very interesting. Where is Tiffany? Wait, I'm confused now, I thought she was with you. (gunshot) [Mrs. O'Brien] Tiffany? Tiffany! What's going on? Nothing, Mrs. O'Brien! [Mrs. O'Brien] Okay. Yeah hello, police? I have to report a murder. A young man. The address is 250 East 23rd Street. Uh-huh. Well when I came in here, I bumped into a guy, he was a police officer. I think he was a detective. I mean that's a gold shield right? Okay, yeah sure, I'll wait here. Definitely. Not. (rock music) Take a look at this. What kind of shit is this? It's this sick 70s kind of concept album. I mean their whole image is based on Dante's Inferno with some sword and sorcery shit mixed in. How many detectives couldn't figure this out? I know, it's all bullshit. They're talking about fucked up stuff. Reunion in Hell for all with the faith, get back together ghostly as a race? I know, everything's about suicide and death, it's typical 70s metal. [Mickey] Mark Trax is obsessed with this band and stupid obviously is killing them. Why? I guess he's killing people that he doesn't think are worth living. But that doesn't explain how you guys are connected, I mean what does he want with you? It's a long story. Mick, look at that smoking Spanish chick over there. She's gonna have a lot of kids. No Mirror Man stuff today. Maybe it's his day off. You want to hear my theory on this? No, not really. I'm just kidding, relax. What is your theory? Well no one's ever seen this guy right? So everybody pictures him as a big fucked up psycho. Which he is. I don't know, all his victims have died without a struggle right, so what do you have to be to just sit there and get killed? [Brandon] What, I don't know. Hypnotized. Great theory Mick, the guy's a fucking hypnotist. Let's drive down to One Police Plaza and tell everybody the news, they'll think we're fucking morons, what are you kidding me? All his victims have been fairly young right? Yeah, so? All the murders have been around here or downtown. Right. Okay, so what do you have around here, you got a lot of bars, got a lot of rock clubs, after hours joints, the guy's part of that scene. He's probably young, good looking, he fits right in, he's not a monster. He fits right in here. And then what does he do, hypnotize the people? I haven't figured that part out yet. Some of kind of rock and roll drug thing or something. Mick, you know something? You're gonna make a great detective. Not. Where are you going? You're driving our of our sector, what are you doing? Let's just take a look around here. You know something, we get caught, I lose vacation days, I'm gonna kick your ass, all right? You're the one who always wants to bend the rules. I don't give a shit, I don't wanna lose my days, all right? Mickey, come in Mick. Wake up, Mick. Mick, the light's green, it's gonna be red again soon, let's get with the program. What's that up there? I don't know, it's probably some kind of joint, why? I've never seen it before. Maybe someone's throwing a party. So what, what's the big deal? Let's go check it out. What the fuck for? (screams) Assholes. Look out. Brandon, Brandon, Brandon! Wait for me! 10-13, office needs assistance! I'm coming, Brandon! Brandon, where are you? I can't see, where are you? [Brandon] Over here Mick, over here, get over here! What the fuck is going on in this place? I can hear you but I can't see you. [Brandon] I'm over here! (screams) Brandon! Brandon! [Brandon] Follow my voice, Mick! Where are you? I see something! Brandon, I see him, Brandon, I see him! [Brandon] Get your gun out, get your gun out! It's him! [Mickey] Who, who is it? (distorted rock music) Brandon, I see him! [Brandon] Mick, are you okay? Pull your gun out, Mick? What? [Brandon] Pull your fucking gun out all the way if you see him. I see him! (gunshot) Brandon! Jesus God, Brandon! (gagging) (screaming) He's only a kid! He's only a kid! That is really fucked up. But it sounds like it wasn't your fault. What did they do to Trax? Well Trax never said a word to anyone. Not to the cops, not to the judge. Not even to his lawyer. He got sent up for life. Now he's back. Look, I'm not gonna put you in anymore danger. What do you mean? Thanks for all your help, I mean you were a big help on this case. What are you talking about? I solved this fucking case. I thought we were a team. Yeah. So stop being a dick, all right? You need all the friends you can get. But right now our biggest problem is catching that guy before he does Capeti right? You're right. Come on. (dramatic synthesizer music) McCardle, we're from (mumbles), step away from the girl. Just keep your hands by your side where I can see them. What do you got? [Officer] Your gun was found at the murder scene. The victim was Stewart Damon, 18 year old white man. The log books says you paid him a visit. Ballistics is working on it, but we came up with your name from the serial number on the piece. When did this happen? [Officer] Don't worry, I'm sure there will be a lot of of brass to explain everything to you downtown. Right now you're the main suspect. (music intensifies) Listen, before you take him down to Police Plaza. Freeze! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Put your hands up, get out of the car! Whoa, watch where you point that thing! All right, all right, all right, take it easy! What the fuck do you think you're doing? Down, down, put your hands down! Now stay that way! The fucking handcuffs. Don't worry about the fucking handcuffs, just drive! Go! Just drive! Pull over here. [Tiffany] Why, what are we doing? [Mickey] Gotta ditch the car. All right. Oh shit, how are we gonna get you out of the handcuffs? Look in the glove compartment. Look for a ballpoint pen. Take the top off. Put it in the keyhole. Ow! [Tiffany] I'm sorry. Try and turn it out. I got it. What's going on? This is never easy. The guy killed your boyfriend. At your house. (sobbing) Oh shit. The bonehead probably invited him in for a cup of coffee. He stole my gun, killed your boyfriend, on top of everything else I'm a prime murder suspect. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I got you into this. Jesus, you got a major self pity thing going on. This guy is fucking with you Mickey, this is pathetic, all right? We're in a lot of trouble here right? I mean I'm probably gonna get 100 years for pulling a gun on those cops. There's only one thing to do. Exactly, if we don't get this guy nobody's gonna believe us. I gotta call a friend, you all right? How do I know? We better get out of here. (dramatic jazzy music) (dramatic rock music) (phone rings) Hello? Tony. Mickey, Christ, what the fuck is going on with you? I didn't kill that kid. You're crazy calling me here. I said I didn't kill that kid. The boy is dead. They got the murder weapon, it's your gun. Ballistics has got the match. He took my gun at the junkyard. This does not look good. Look, either you believe me or you don't, if you believe me I need you to run a name for me. Vince Capeti, lives somewhere in the... Who is he, how am I gonna find him? Come on. Look it up in the phone book, I don't know. Come on, you're a detective. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Wait, let me get a pen. You weren't listening? I'm just trying to make sure. Look, I'll call you in a half hour all right? Whole fucking department is looking for you. They say you've got an underage female with you? That's right, she's my new partner. Tony, what do you got for me? Well I got something for you. What do you mean, who is it? Look, let me get something straight. This is the guy you say is gonna get hit by the other guy right? Something like that, Tony. Just give me what you got. It just doesn't make any sense. Listen, this guy works for the transit authority, he's a subway conductor. Guy's gonna do him tonight. What else you got? Well all I know for sure is that he's working on the Double R local tonight. Thanks, Tony. I just don't understand Mick, I mean what's the connection? Just trust me. I was right once before. Yeah, well you better be right this time. If you are, I hope you nail this motherfucker. I heard that. Hey! Vince Capeti. I can't believe it after all these years. I'm drawing a blank, buddy. ♪ Puncture the abyss ♪ Zone into the void ♪ What you see you can't avoid Stare Into the Abyss. You know the lyrics to that shit song? It's not a shit song. You wrote it.
