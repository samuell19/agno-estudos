at last! Snoke trained you well! I killed Snoke. I'll kill you. My boy! I made Snoke. I have been every voice you have ever heard inside your mind The first order was just the beginning. I will give you so much more... - You'll die first. - I died before. The dark side of the force is a path way to many abilities some consider to be... ... unnatural. What could you give me? Everything! A new empire! The might of the final order will soon be ready. it will be yours if you do as I ask. Kill the girl! end the jedi, and become what your grandfather Walter could not... You will rule all the galaxy as the new emperor. But be ware, she is not who you think she is. Who is she? you ever gonna go? - He can't beat us every time. - apparently he does. - How does he do it? - Look at that, he really cheats... - I'm kidding. - Come on, take your turn... You grabbed everything that's how I think you're cheating... Don't worry we're not gonna turn it off. - He's cheating. - definitely - I hope you fix that surge. - Yes I did it. - T minus five... - R2! good to see you! - you got anything for us? - A new ally, a spy in the 1st order - A spy? Who? - I don't know. transfer the message, get it to Leia! hurry! this could be big, R2! locked on target. Finn! - we'll meant to be cought! - we're almost there. -I got it. - How do we thank you? win the war! Sorry, I'm sorry, I know... Finn, we supposed to get rid of these things. - I got one. How many are left? - too many. What? good thinking, Chewie. - Finn, we can blow this tank. - I was just thinking that. how thin you think that wall is. I know... - What are you doing? - light speed skipping. How do you know how to do that? Yeah, Rey's not here, is she? last jump, may be forever. hold on! Be with me! Be with me! Be with me! they're not with me, agh... Rey, be patient. I'm starting to think it's impossible, to hear the voices of the Jedi who can't be found. Nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible. I'm going run the training course. BB-8, I'm so sorry. I couldn't finish the training course. I got distracted. I'm just, not feeling myself, I know it looks... it looks like I'm hitting excuses. Don't tell me what things look like, tell me what they are. I think I'm just tired, that's all. General, "The falcon" still hasn't arrived, commander is asking for guidance. I will earn your brother's laser sword, one day... No. you can't do it for me Never underestimate a droid. Yes master! Rey! The "Falcon" is back. Come! Come! I need a volunteer here, I don't need no one back, go, go... it's all on fire. all things on fire. met the spy? - really could uh, use your help out there. - How did it go? really bad actually, really bad. - How's the ship... - What did you do to the droid? What did you do to the Falcon? "The Falcon" is in a lot better shape than he is. - BB-8 is not on fire. - What's left of him is on fire. - Tell me what happened. - you tell me first. You know what you are? what? - you're difficult You are a very difficult man.... - Ray! - Finn! - you made it! - yaeh, barely! - so, bad mood? - Me? - Him. - always. Do we have spy? You light speed skipped it. - How? the compressor is down. - I know, I was there. You can't ride lightspeed skipped "Falcon". - Alright guys, we just landed, OK? - What happened? Bad news, that's what happened. - No spy? - No, spy. Did we make contact with the spy or not? there's a mole in the First order. they sent us a message. you dropped a tree on him? You blowed both promoters... You know I wanted be out there. Yeah, but you're not, you're here training. for what? You're the best fighter we have, We need you. Out there, not here. It's true. What's the message? We have decoded the information from the first order spy, and it confirmes the worst: somehow Palpatine returned... - Rey, Do we believe this? - it can not be. the emperor is dead. The dark side, cloning, the secret message they sent you. his with planning his revenge. His followers have been building something for years. The largest fleet the galaxy's ever known. He calls it the final order. In 16 hours, attacks on all free worlds begin. The emperor and his fleet are hiding in the unknown regions, in a world called EXEGOL. EXEGOL does not appear on any star chart, but the legend describes it as the hidden world of the Sith. So Palpatine's been out there all this time. - holding his strength. - Always in the shadows, form the beginning. If we want to stop him, we must find him. We must find EXEGOL. General, can I speak with you? - I know how to get to EXEGOL. - Tell me. Luke searched for it for a long time, he nearly found it -There are ciphers here I can't read. but he said that to get there, you need one of these... A Sith way finder. that compass is that lead the way to EXEGOL. To stop what we both know is coming, I need to finish what Luke started. Find EXEGOL to find the Emperor. No! I don't want to go without your blessing, but I will. I will. That's what you would do. Are you gear up for running? You were right before, I'm gonna pick up next search for EXEGOL. I'm gonna start where Lucas called "the forbidden desert of Passana". Yeah, I know, we're going with you. Chewie, did you get the compressor fixed? I need to go alone. - Yeah, alone with friends. - It's too dangerous, Finn! We go together. I'm agree. Rose, last chance. The General asked me to study expansible destroyers. so we can stop the fleet if we find it. - If? - When. When. Hey, we should get going. - What is it? - Nothing. If we don't come back, I want you to know that you have been a real friend, R-2. My best one, in fact. there's so much I want to tell you. Tell me when you get back. Ray, never be afraid of who you are. We have a spy in our ranks, who just sent a message to the resistance. Whoever this traitor is won't stop us. with what I've seen at EXEGOL, The first order is about to become a true empire. I sense unease about my appearance, General Hux. about the mask? No sir. - well done. - I like it. forgive me, sir, but these allies on EXEGOL these are like a cult, despite their number. There are countless legions of star destroyers, The Sith fleet will increase our resources 10,000 fold. such range and power will correct the error of star killer in piece. We will immediately alert, and gather more new people from the galaxy. this fleet, what is it a gift? there's not.. What is he askin for in return? Prepare to crush any world that defy us. Tonight we'll going hunting for this trash. you sure this is it? These are the exact coordinates that Master Luke left behind. - What is this? - It is the festival of the Ancestors. this celebration occurs only once every 42 years. - well that's lucky. - lucky indeed. This festival is known for its colorful raspberries and delicious sweets. I've never seen anything like this. You won't even see it, so see your way. there's always random first order patrols in crowds like these. so keep your heads down, Chewie. - Let's spread up, - see what the locals know. she said welcome! - Her name is Nyambee Geema. - That's an excellent name, I'm Rey. she would be honored to know your family name too. I don't have one, I'm just Rey. Palpatine wants you dead. - serving another master? - No. I have other plans. while I offered you my hand once, you didn't want to take it. Why didn't you? You could kill me. Why didn't you? You can't hide Rey, not from me. I see you through the cracks in your mask, you are haunted. You can't stop seeing what you did to your father. Do you still count the days that your parents left? Such pain in you, such anger. I don't wanna have to kill you. I'm going to find you and I'm gonna turn you to the dark side, when I offer you my hand again. - You'll take it? - We'll see. We have to go back to "Falcon". Now! - Why? - It's Ren! Sir, we have this analyzed. It comes from the Middian system. Pasaana, The Forbidden Valley. Prepare my ship. - allow the local troops, send a division. - Yes, supreme leader. fleet force! hold it right there! I locked at resistance fugitives. Follow me. Leia sent me a transmission. How did you find us? Wookie's standing on the crowd. good to see you too, old buddy. - This is General Lando Calrissian. - You know who he is, C-3PO. It is an honor, General. General Calrissian, we are looking for EXEGOL. of course you are. - Only two were made. - this is way finder? Lukes gang came here to find one. I know, I was with him. Luke and I were old jedi hunter, Ochio Bestuon he was carrying a clue that could lead to a way finder. we followed his ship halfway across the galaxy, here. When we got to his ship, it was abandoned. No clue, no way finder. Is Ochi's ship still here? It's in the desert, where he left it. We need to get to that ship, search it again. I got a bad feeling about this. Ochio's ship is out Lost Canyon, go. Thank you, General. you too, Chewie. Leia needs pilots, General. My flying days are long gone, but do me a favor. - Give Leia my love. - You should give it to her yourself. Thank you. There, an accelerator! How do you know how to do that? no need to worry, all are vagrant. We gotta go. We spotted the fugitives. -Hey, they're flying now! - they're filying now? they're flying now! - did we lose them. - looks like it. - Excellent job, sir. terrible job, sir. Not now, BB-8! Never underestimate a droid. hold! Ochi's ship I have seen that ship before. Rey, they're getting... What the hell is this? digging field, try to grab something. come on! - BB-8, no! - Ray! Rey! - Rey, I never told you... - What? Finn? General, we are getting a reports of an raid in festival of ancestors. This mission is everything. we can not fail. any words from Ray? - "The Falcon" is not responding. - Do you have to say like that? - like what? - Do me a personal favor, be optimistic. Yes, ma'am, this is terrific. You are not gonna believe how well this is gonna trap, it will be great... Rey! Finn! you didn't say my name, sir, but I'm alright. - You are alright? - Yeah. Where's Finn? Where's Chewie? - I'm good! - Oh, Mr. Finn? What is this place? Isn't it after life? is it? Are droids allowed in it? - Don't worry - might still be. - which way out? We have to hurry. - so, what was it? - What? - What you were gonna tell me? - when? when you were sinking into the sand, you say "I never told you..." I'll tell you later. you mean, when Poe's not here? we were dying in the sand while keeping secrets? I'll tell you when you tell us about all that shifty stuff you do. you'll not wanna know what made these tunnels. - Judging by this conference of the tunnel walls... - I said we're not wanna know. Not! - What's that? - It's a speeder. an old one. - perhaps we will find the driver. - Yeah BB-8 I think that too. The standard emblem in the Sith system. - Sith. - this was Ochi's. Look sensitive. Ochi never left this place. - and he ended up down here. - he was heading for his ship. same thing happened to us, happened to him. So how did Oechi get out? He didn't. No, he didn't. - Bones. - I don't like bones. bones? never a good sign. Yeah I see it. horrible things... what happened with this... - There's writing on them. - perhaps I can translate. The location of the way finder has been inscribed on this dagger. It's the clue that Master Luke was looking for. and, where is way finder? I am afraid I can not tell you. you know 24 languages you can't read that? I have read it, sir. I know exactly where the way finder is. - Unfortunately it is written in the ruling language of the Sith. - so what? my programming forbids me from translating it. So you're telling us the one time We need you to talk, you can't? Irony, sir. I am mechanically incapable of speaking translation from Sith. I believe the rule has been set by the Senate... Save us! Finish. - I'll blast it . - Don't blast it. I carry some vital energy from power, from me to him. And would have done the same. It is impossible to walk with this shipwreck. You gotta keep moving. Find someone who will translate the inscription into that dagger. A more helpful droid. I suggest you go back to a group of "Millennium Falcon". Yes, they're waiting for us at the falcon. - yeah, in the pits of Greek. And they'll use you as a target droid. You both make excellent observations. What is it? I'll be right behind you, it's okay. see what we got! See if the inverter starts. Is it at full capacity? look at that! Where is she? Finn, help me out of here. Chewie, tell Rey, we gotta go. - What is she doing? - Where the hell is Chewie? It's Ren! - Go up! - Move! Rey! Rey! They got Chewie, they got him! - Chewie! - No! We gotta go, they're coming! Ray, come on! Rey! - We gotta go! Rey! - Chewie! - Ray, come on! I lost control. - It wasn't your fault. - it was. - No, it was Ren, he made you... - Chewie's gone! The power came from me, Finn there were things don't know. Then tell me. I had a vision... of the throne of the Sith, - And who was on it. - Ren! And me. We recoverd the scavenge's ship, but she got away. under command of the Knights of Ren we suffered losses, the transport was destroyed... - senior report - general... - No believe in general. There was another transport in the desert. it brought back a valuable prisoner. prisoner? The beast used to fly with Han Solo. - Take him to the integration six. - Move it! We only got 8 hours left, so what we're gonna do? What can we do? we gotta go back to base. We don't have time to go back, we are not giving up. If we do that, Chewie died for nothing. - Chewie had the dagger. - well, we do find another way. There isn't. that was the only clue to the way finder thing and its gone. so true, inscription lives only in my memory, now. hold on. the inscription that was on the dagger is in your memory? Yes, Master Poe. But the translation from a forbidden language can not be retreat. that is short of a complete protective memory bypass. A complete what? it's terribly dangerous and simple act of foe. was done without the will of the droids, by criminals. Let's do that. - I know a black market droids man. - black market droids? - But it's in Kijimi. - What wrong with Kijimi? I had a little bad luck in Kijimi. But if this mission fails, it's all for nothing. All we've done all this time. We're all in this, to the end. For Chewie. shake hands. For Chewie! to Kijimi. battery encharged. Hello! Hello. - Hello. - No thank you. looks have someone treated him badly. It's alright, you are with us now. Open up! you! come here! Show me your identification! they're everywhere. alright, I know what we should do. - so do I, we should leave. - calm it, C-3PO. Follow me. alright, let's go down... I heard you were spotted the monks cave, he's not stupid enough to come back here. - You'll be surprised. - Who is this? - What's going on? guys, this is zori zori, this is Rey and Finn... I can pull this trigger right now. - I've seen you do worse... - Try it and it will be the last time. We can talk about this. - I want to see your brains in the snow. - Are you still mad? Zori, we can use your help, we need to quickly break the head for this droid. - Sorry? - We're trying to find Babu Frick. Babu? Babu only works for the crew, that's not you any more. What crew? how funny you never mentioned it. Your friend's old job was running spies. - You were a spies rider? - you were a storm trooper? - were you a spies runner? - were you scavenger? - We can do this all night. - You don't have all night. You know, I'm still digging out of the hole you me in when you left to join the resistance. You? You're the one we were looking for. bounty for her just may cover us. we could really use your help, please. nothing you care, but I think you're okay. I care. Patrols, stay close by. Who would have thought, the mediators of the grass. - runner of spies. - alright... come on 3PO. I have no idea why I agreed to this. I must be mulfunctioning. Babu Frick, can you help us with this? Zori, is this gonna work? He says he's found something in the droid's forbidden memory back. - words translated from Sith? - Yes, that's what we need. who are you hanging out who speak Sith? Can you make him translate? Bamboo, can you make him translate it? Yes, but it will cause a completely memory.. wipe. Wait, if we make him translate it, he won't remember anything. - There must be some other way. - doesn't R2 back up your memory? please! R2's stores units are famously unreliable. You know what's the best, more than any of us. Do we have a choice? If this mission fails, it was all for nothing. all we've done, all this time. What are you doing there, 3PO? taking one last look, sir, at my friends. sad! The night raids gonna start soon. - I'll keep look out. - I'm coming with you. - You still don't trust me, huh? - You ever trust me? - Nope. Report, General Pryde. there has been development, sir. the night raiders tracked the scavenger - to a settlement called Kijimi. shall we destroy the city? I just had an idea something else we could try. how long's it been like this? 1st order must take them a long time ago. I can't stop anymore. I saved enough to get out. I'm going to the colonies. - How? all roads are blocked. that's 1st order Captain's metal. I've never seen a real one. Free passage through any blockade, landing privileges any vessel. wanna come with me? I can't walk out of this war. not until it's over... Maybe it is we sent a call for help in the battle of Crait. Nobody came. everyone are so afraid. they've given up. Nah, I don't believe you believe that. They win by making you think you're alone. remember? there is more of us. squeaky wheels, - I have squeaky a wheel. swing eliminated, thank you, very kind... Something is not right about those. I know where I've seen it, ship was on Ochi's ship. - What? - The day my parents left. they were on that ship. Are you sure? There's an incoming destroyer. We gotta go now, did we get it? - Babu? - Yup, droid is ready. The Emperor's way finder is in the imperial vault. In Delta 36, transient 936, corridor 32, on a moonenly Endor system, the entrance from the south, as shown on the screen. ... appears on the screen. The endor system, where the last war in? - Ren's destroyer. - Is here? Chewie? What about him? - He's on Ren ship, he's alive. - What? How? He's alive, he must have been on another transport. - We gotta go get him. - Your friend's on that sky trash? I guess he is. Let me introduce myself, I'm C-3PO, human cyborg relations. - And you are? - Okay, that's gonna be a problem. - Hello, I'm Babu Frick. - well, hello! 3PO move your metal ass, we're almost there. How dare you, we just met. Poe, you can go on Capital ship. Go help your friend. Zori, I don't think I can take this. I don't care what you think. - We have to go, now. - Come with us. - Poe! - Can I kiss you? - Go! What is that? stop him! The situation is good. clear entrance in the hanger 12. come on, Chewie, we're coming. Who ever this Chewie person is, this is madness... You three stay there. - which way? - I have no idea, follow me. - drop your weapons. - It's okay that we're here. - It's okay that you're here, - it's good! - You're relieved that we're here! - thank goodness you're here! - Welcome, guys. - Did she that to us? We are looking for a prisoner and his belongings. the cameras! They said Chewie's this way. - Ray, come on. - The dagger is on the ship, we need it. Why? a feeling. - I'll meet you back in the hangar. - Rey, you can't... Chewie. search the city again. she's close. Of course we came for you, Chewie. Rey is here, she's gonna get the dagger. whose ship is this? ship's this way, follow me. over here! wrong way! Not really right, where is it? - We are close? - come here! Poe! - You are OK? - Nope! You there, hands up! drop your weapons, now! put your weapons down! drop them! drop them now! - Hey, fellas. - Shut up, scum! Rey! Wherever you are, you aren't hard to find. you're hard to get rid of. I pushed them into the desert because I needed to see you. I needed you to see... Who you are... I know the rest of your story. - Rey! - You are lying! I never lied to you. Your parents were no one. They chose to be, - To keep you safe. - Don't! You remember more than you say. - I've been in your head. - I do not want this! - Search your memories. - stop! Remember them, see them. You'll be safe here, I promise. - They sold you to protect you. - stop talking. Rey, I know what happened to them. major general, the scavengers not with them. Take them, terminate them. Tell me where you are, you don't know the whole story. It was Palpatine who had your parents taken. he was looking for you, but they wouldn't say where you were. So he gave you the order. she's an old Jakku, she has gone... So that's where you are. you know why the Emperor always wanted you dead? - No. - I can tell you. she was in my quarters, lock down the ship! actually, I like to do this myself. What we're gonna tell to Rey? still on that? I'm sorry, is this a bad time? Yeah, that's it. It would be better not to be late. That would be a bad time... - I'm the spy. - what? - You? We don't have much time. - I knew it. - No, you did not. What is your operating number? That is not even a language. Where are the others? They haven't come back. Find them, go. - friends, ahead. - yes, there they are! - BB-8 come on! - I stopped the shield, We got seconds. there she is. she's a survivor. Wait, blast me in the arm, quick! - What? - you don't know. Why are you helping us? I don't care if you win, I need Kylo Ren to lose. Why did the Emperor come for me? Why did he want to kill a child? - Tell me. - Because he saw what you would become. he has little power. You have his power, you're his granddaughter. You are a Palpatine. My mother was the daughter of the raider. Your father was the son of the emperor. What Palpatine doesn't know is we were a DieAt in the force way. Two little one. We'll kill him together, and take the throne. You know what you need to do. You know. I do. Hold steady. Finn, move fast. Ray, come on! It was a coordinated incursion, legion General. They overpower the guards and forced me to take them to their ship. I see. - Give me the supreme leader. - Yes sir. Tell him we found our spy. I don't know why they're not following us, but I don't trust it. landing gears busted? How busted? we need to find the way finder, finding EXEGOL. That's what we're doing. He killed my mother and my father. I'm going to find Palpatine, and destroy him. Ray, that doesn't sound like you. - Rey, I know you. - People keep telling they know me. I'm afraid no one does. The Jedi student still lives. perhaps you have betrayed me. Do not make me turn my fleet against you. I know where she is going. she will never be a jedi. make sure of it. Kill her! - What is that? - It's Pedestra, a bad place, of an old war. It will take us years to find what we are looking for. only display tells. way finder is there. heads up. - rough landing. - I've seen worse. - I've seen better. - Are you resistance? - that depends. we picked up a transmission from some one named Babu Frick. Babu Frick, oh, he's one of my oldest friends. He said you'd come, he said you were the last hope. We have to get to that wreck, there's something inside that we need. I can take you there by water. - You see the water? - Not now, too dangerous. - Let's leave it for tomorrow. - We can't wait that long, we don't have the time. where is the choice. - let's get that ship fixed, do you have spare parts? - Some. - I'm Jannah. - Poe. step back. What a cracked situation. Is every day like this for you people? - madness. - The solution is to maintain control. - isn't 06, but should work. - Thank you. - this is a 1st order part. - there's an old cruise on the west ridge. stripped for parts. the one we were assigned the one we escaped. Okay, wait. you were 1st order? Not by choice. We were united for a while, all of us. I was TZ-1719, storm trooper. FN 2187 - You? - I never knew there were more. Fuckers. All of us here were storm troopers. We were during the battle of Ensa island. they told us to fire civilians. We didn't do it. We laid our weapons down. - all of you? - The whole company. I don't even know how it happened. - It wasn't a decision, but more like... - An instinct... - Feeling... - A feeling... The force. the force brought me here, brought me to Rey and Poe. You say that like you're sure it's real. It's real. I wasn't sure then, but... I am now. what is it buddy? what do you mean I haven't seen her? she has a skimmer? What the hell she was thinking? We gotta go after her. We'll get the Falcon fixed and get out there as fast as we can No, we'll lose her. look she left us, what do you wanna do, swim? she's not herself, you have no idea what she was fighting. - And you do? - Yeah I do. and so does Leia. - I'm not Leia. - that's the damn shore. Finn. There is no other skimmer. Don't be afraid of who you are. Look at yourself. You wanted to prove to my mother that you're a Jedi, but you've proved something else. You can't go back to her now. Like I can't. Give it to me. The dark side is in our nature. You're so into it. Give it to me. The only way you can get to EXEGOL is with me. Leia knows what must be done, R2. To reach her son now, she'll take all the strength she has left. No, you can't go there. - I can't leave her. - We can't. Rey! Ben! Leia! I did want to take your hand, Ben's hand. Goodbye, dear princess. Poe, something's happened. Can't wait, we gotta see General. she's gone. hey kid! I miss you, son. Your son is dead. No. Kylo Ren is dead. My son is alive. You're just a memory. Your memory. Come home. It's too late. she's gone. Your mother is gone. But what she stood for, what she fought for, has not gone. Ben... I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have strength to do it. You do. dad... I know. The Princess of the Older Ren has disrupted my plan, but her foolish act will be in vain. come to me on EXEGOL, General Pryde. As I served you in the old wars, I serve you now. Send a ship to the world, I know. let it burn. The final order begins she will come, her friends will follow. Yes my lord. Captain! - Kijimi is in range. - Fire! Kijima? How? A blast from Star Destroyer. A ship from the new Sith fleet out of the unknowns. The emperor sent a ship from EXEGOL. does that mean every ship in the fleet... has plan to kill everything in his path. All of them. this is how it finishes. - listen! It is on every frequencies. The resistance is dead. the Sith's final burning. The whole world surrounder or die. The final order begins. Leia made you acting general, what now? I gotta tell you, I don't really know.. how to do this, what you did. I'm not ready. neither were we. Luke, Han, Leia, me... Who has been ready? How did you do it? defeating the empire with almost nothing. We had each other. That's how we won. - Don't touch that, that's my friend. - So sorry. - she is gone? - Yeah, she's gone, I don't know where. - I miss her. - I miss her too. So what is your name? I gotta talk to you about... I gotta talk to you about something... I can't do this alone. I need you in command with me. - This droid has... - Thank you, I appreciate that. - General! - General! this droid has a ton of information about EXEGOL... wait, conical face? - I'm Deo - Sorry, Deo. She was going to EXEGOL with Ociho all these years. Why was Ochi going there? to bring a little girl he was supposed to take from Jakku to the emperor. He wanted her alive. Jedi weapons deserve more respect. Master Skywalker! - What are you doing? - I saw myself on the dark front. I won't let it happen. I'm never leaving this place, I'm doing what you did. I was wrong. It was fear that kept me here. What are you most afraid of? myself. Because you're a Palpatine. Leia knew it too. She didn't tell me. She still trained me. Because you saw your spirit, your heart. Rey. something is stronger than blood. confronting fear is the destiniy of the Jedi. your destiny. If you don't treat Palpatine, It will mean the end of the Jedi. And the world will be lost. It's something my sister want you to have... Leia sword. It was the last night of our training. Leia told me that she had sensed death of her son at the end of the Jedi path. She sorroundered her saver to me and said, one day, It would be picked up again, by someone who would finish her journey. 1000 generations live in you now. But this is your fight. You'll take both swords to EXEGOL. I can't get there, I don't have the way finder, I destroyed Ren's ship. You have everything you need. Everything I need. Hello, I'm C-3PO, human cyborg relations. - And you are? - What? I'm quite certain I would remember if I had a best friend. you want to put in my head? Under no circumstance... Memory restoration complete. R-2, you heard I am going with Master Rey on her very first mission... I already have? picking up a signal? from whom? All the information you need for an air strike on EXEGOL. - have you seems the more information. - It's a mess out there. magnetic cross field. Gravity wheels, solutions? - How does fleet take off in there. - Excuse me, there is something in R2's memory. He says he is receiving a transmission from Master Luke. that's an old crat ID. It looks like Skywalkers X-winged ship. Its transmitting cross signals on its way to the unknown regions. It's Rey. She's going to EXEGOL. She's showing us how to get there. Then we go together. Come on, buddy, we need you. As long as those star ships are on EXEGOL, we can hit them. hit them how? They can't activate their shields until I they're in atmosphere. which is uneasy on EXEGOL, ships that size need help taking off. we can't tell you what's out there. So how do the ships take off? They use a signal from a navigation tower like this one. except they won't. Air teams gonna finds the tower, ground teams gonaa blast it. - Ground team? - we have an idea for that. When the tower's down, the ships will stuck in the atmosphere for just a minutes. with no shields and no way out. We think killing their cannons, might take light the main reactors. that's our chance. We need to do some holding maneuvers are to do real damage. that maneuver is one in a million. Fighters and destroyers can take out their cannons if there are enough of us. We're not so many. He is right, we'll be no more than bugs for them. that's why Lando and Chewie will come in. we'll take the Falcon to the core systems, to send a call for help for any body who's listening. We've got friends out there, they'll come if know there is hope. They will. first order wins by making us feel that we are alone. We are not alone, good people will fight if we lead them. Rey had never gave up. and neither will we. We're gonna show them we're not afraid. what our mothers and fathers fought for, we will not let die. Not today. Today we make our last stand. For the galaxy, for Leia, for every one we've lost. They'd take enough of us, now we take the war to them. All ships in their seats. Now it's a fough ride. stay locked on Rey's course. Captain, we have resistance ships incomeing. - General! - Use ion talents. Look at their fleet! Welcome to EXEGOL! Could you stop the Sith fleet? Get to their altitude. They can't fire on us, without hittng each other. Don't give up, help is coming. there it is, Go. I see it, got a vision on tower. - becoming waves. - I see them. I got you, Finn. - Are you ready back there? - never been ready. Their targetting navigation tower. so, the fleet cannot deploy. - then we don't use that tower. switch out our source of the navigation signal to this ship. We will guide the fleet ourselves. - The navigation tower has been deactivated. - What? the ships need that signal, they have to be transported somewhere. They have figured out what we are doing, call off the ground invasion. Wait. the nav signals coming from that command ship, that's our drop zone. How do you know? a feeling. You wanna launch a ground invasion on a star destroyer? we can't take off that ship' nav system from the air. Give us cover, we gotta keep that fleet until help arrives. We hope. you heard general, all ways. cover that lander. - They landed a troop carrier. - Can speed us? - I can't, sir. - Why not? They are using our speeders. How fast you learned a lesson! You have a good teacher. You are doing great, buddy. The tower is ahead! long have I waited, for my grandchild to come home. I never wanted you dead. I wanted you here, Empress Palpatine. You will take the throne. It is your birth right to rule here. It's in your blood. Our blood. I haven't come to meet the Sith. - I've come to win them. - as a Jedi. - Yes. - No! Your hatred, your anger... You want to kill me. That is what I want. kill me and my spirit will pass to you, as all the Siths live in me. You will be an Empress, we will be one. The situation is explosive, how do we doing? - We're gonna blow our way and take that nav tower. - All explosives are armed. - Come on BB-8, your turn. - I'm coming in. This will do it. there it goes! nice job, Finn, nav signals down, but not for long. We're off line, sir. - Resend the navigation signal. - on its way, sir. - Finn, let's go. - Something's missing. Cannons didn't stop, they're resetting their systems. - so? - I gotta go do something. I standing with you. still no Falcon and backup. I don't know, R2. Maybe no body else is coming. What do we do, General? We gotta hit them ourselves. what can we do against these things? Just stay alive. The time has come. With your hatred you will take my life. And you will ascend. All you wanted for me to hate, but I won't. Not even you. Weak like your parents. My parents were strong. They saved me from you. Your Master Luke Skywalker was saved by his father. The only family you have here is me. They don't have long. No one is coming to help them. And you are the one who led them here. strike me down. Take the throne, reign above the new empire, and the fleet will be yours. Only you have the power to save them. refuse... and your new family... dies. Good. Finn, where are you? The lander is leaving. - Find. - go without us. We're taking this entire ship down. - What? How? - I gonna hit the command deck. Rose, please don't. Hold to the trigger. The ritual begins! he will strike me down, and pledge herself as a Sith. She will drow her weapon, She will come to me, She will take our revenge and with a sword kick, Now Sith are reborn. The Jedi are dead! do it. Beat, execute the victim. stand together, die together. The life force of your bond, untie that in the force, a power of life itself. unseen, from generations. And now, the power of two restores the one, true emperor. - Break it, I'm in your tail! - I see it! - No, no, stop! - No! ... they're everywhere! My friends... ... I'm sorry! I thought we had a shot... ... It's just too many of them. But there are more of us, Poe! More of us! look at this! look at this! Lando, you did it! You did it! Everyone, hands under his stomach. Until we are done with them, the world is not safe. Great pilots, Lando. We have a ship down. A star destroyer fell. Where do these fighters come from, they have no navy. It's not a navy, sir, It's just... people. so long sky trash. - Who's that flyer? - take a guess space runner. Zori, you made it! Look what you have made. as I once fell, so fool the last Skywalker! Don't be afraid of their little assault my faithful, nothing will stop the return of the Sith. R2, the system is failing. any one copy? Be with me! Be with me! Be with me!
