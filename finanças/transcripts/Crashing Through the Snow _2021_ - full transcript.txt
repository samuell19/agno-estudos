Hello, Jeff. - See ya doc. - Oh wow, these ornaments are gorgeous, are they family heirlooms? - My stepmother's decorator had them flown in from Venice, they're hand-blown and apparently quite fragile, so, let's all steer clear, Susan's a little particular about the trees. - How many are there? - Too many to count and each one has its own theme. - No wrapping paper ornaments here. - Oh, is that like a TikTok thing? - It's more like a family tradition, on Christmas day we gather up all the torn wrapping paper and use it to make an ornament, decoupage style. - I make one every year. - Well, ever since Mia was two, back then she liked the gift wrap more than the toys. - She was so cute running around with her chubby little hands grabbing up fistfuls of paper. - Mom stop. - Well, I think that is just about the sweetest thing, that I've heard. - Well, I can show you how to make one. - Girls, Kate has all sorts of special things lined up for Christmas the whole week in fact. - We're gonna have the best time, how about I show you around? - Yeah, where's the closet? - That view is spectacular. - It is nicer than any hotel I have ever stayed in. - And that's a problem because? - It's not it's just Jeff's acting kind of weird, it's like he's worried, I'm gonna make him look bad or something. - Well, it's bound to get awkward at some point, I mean, you are spending Christmas with your ex-husband's new girlfriend's parents. - You should see the rest of the house, there is a sauna in my room an actual sauna, there's an indoor racquetball court, a private chef. - Well, that sounds awful. - I just wished Jeff would've given me, the heads up about Kate's family, so, I could have been mentally prepared. - Is Mia still getting her big surprise? - Yes, I cannot wait to see the look on Mia's face, when she opens these earrings. - Well, how are you gonna pull that one off? - I found a tattoo parlor in Aspen that does piercings and I booked her an appointment for the 26th, who's the cool mom now? - This isn't about Kate, is it? - What, no, please, okay, maybe a little, you should see this itinerary she made, there is a Nutcracker tea party at the St. Mark's hotel, caroling by horse-drawn sleigh, I can't compete with it. - You don't have to compete, you're the mom, you are a Christmas.

Maggie is a guest. - I fly in from Tokyo to surprise you, I thought that would get me, I don't know a hug, a steak, ability to sleep in my own bed. - Okay, here's a hug, Josie, can you fix this boy a rib-eye, you gonna have to settle for two out of three. - Hello, everyone, so sorry I am late, there was a crazy line at the bell mountain lift. - You must be Maggie, I am Susan, Ted's wife, it's so, nice to meet you. - Sam, what are you doing here? I thought you were staying in Japan for the holidays. - We all did. - Well not everyone plans as far ahead as you Kit Kat. - Well, not everyone shows up at the last minute and expects the world to revolve around him. - So, Maggie, Kate, tells me, that you run your own graphic design business in Austin? - I do it's mostly branding campaigns, websites, logos, pitch decks, that kind of thing. - Maggie is being modest she's incredibly talented. - Yes, you should see the adorable poster, she designed for Sophie's school concert. - Well that, that was more of a volunteer project, I usually work with ad agencies and corporate clients. - Well, I'm sure you're ready for some, well-deserved downtime. - Oh, did you know your room has a sauna in it? - Oh, she knows. - View is the same inside you know and they have this thing called heat. - Yes but out here I can be alone. - I have a proposition for you. - If you think I'm gonna serenade you again, you are sorely mistaken. - No, this is work-related, I have a meeting in Aspen on Christmas Eve and I wanna hire you to make me a pitch deck. - So, all that talk back there about flying in from Japan, to surprise your family that was all an act? - Can't it be both? Come on, this meeting is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me, I'd be happy to double your rate. - You've never even seen my work. - Yeah, I googled you just now, the portfolio was very impressive. - I am flattered but unfortunately the answer is no, I am here to spend time with my girls. - Have you seen my sister's itinerary? - Your kid's are gonna be so knee-deep in Christmas, they're not even gonna miss you. Oh, you're worried they're not gonna miss you because they'll be having so much fun with Kate? - The girls and I have our own traditions, I am sure there will be plenty of time for everything, now, if you'll excuse me. - I'll tell you what you make me a deck and I'll help you win Christmas, you know, you scratch my back, I scratch yours. - I didn't come all this way to get my back scratched and for your information I don't need to win Christmas, I'm their mom, I am Christmas. - I'll be here all week if you change your mind. All the big ones are for me. - We're decorating Christmas cookies tonight, it's on the itinerary. - Oh, well look at you Fancy Nancy. - Maggie, come join us. - Oh, sure. - Oh, are those stockings? - Yes, we always hang ours the day after Thanksgiving but I know some families like to wait, until everyone's all together. - Actually Kate had some stockings made for the girls. - We didn't realize that you'd be bringing yours along, there is this fabulous artist in Santa Fe, who makes hand quilted stockings from vintage fabrics, I had one made for you too, it took some doing. - Normally you have to order the months in advance, but Kate turned on the charm and wouldn't take no for an answer. - Wow, that is so thoughtful. - One way to put it. - Did you know Sam and Kate's great-grandfather, opened one of the very first ski lodges in the whole Aspen area? - The Butterfield Inn, we used to spend Christmases there as kids - Back before Dad sold the place. - Who needs a refill? - Oh, Jeff and I will take care of it, you sit down and relax. - Don't be stingy. - Hey I haven't bombed that hard, since I recited the Gettysburg address at my 10th grade talent show. - What are you talking about, the stockings? Don't worry about it, there's like eight fireplaces in this place, we can hang all of them. - Now, Maggie's offended and I wanted everything to be perfect. - It will be and the fact, that you're always thinking of Mia and Sophie, it's one of my favorite things about you, how about later you recite that Gettysburg address for me, Madam president? Yeah, can you do a little Abe Lincoln impression for me? - Oh, I think my dad is watching. - Yeah, he wants a scotch, coming right up Ted. Hey, why don't you sit next to Ted, Ted, we're gonna join you. - Did you bring this wine? - I did, the Karl franc. - So Maggie, what's on tab tomorrow morning, skiing, snowboarding? - I'm sorry just the thought of Maggie on skis. - I think what Jeff's trying to say is I'm a bit of a klutz. - She falls all the time. - Jeff has always been the skier, I'm more of a sit by the fire and read kind of girl. - So, where did you two meet Tinder, Hinge, wait, let me guess Bumble? - No, no, no, this was long before dating apps, I was a sophomore at Brown and Maggie was in her first year at RISD. - I was with some friends at Free Play, this bar in downtown Providence with all these old arcade games. - I challenged her to a round of space invaders. - And I wiped the floor with his face. - Okay and she has been holding it over me ever since. - It's a great story, yeah, I actually meant you and Kate. - Oh, we met on Bumble. - S'mores by the fire holiday movie Bingo, wow, Kate has really outdone herself with this lineup. - She sure has, hey, I wanted to run something by you. What do you say we let Mia get her ears pierced early? - Before she turns 13? - I know just she's such a good kid and this year hasn't been easy, starting middle school and all, I say we go for it. - I think she'd be thrilled. - Great, so we're agreed? - Parents of the year. Wow, that is an impressive axe sir, are you heading out on patrol? - We're running out of firewood. - Right, yes, of course, can I help you with that? - Sure, you can hold the wood. - Okay, have fun out there, watch your fingers. Hey, that's my cookie. - You stole my room now we're even. - My walk-in closet is the size of Rhode Island, so, I think I got the better end of the deal. - Sassy, I like it but can I give you some advice? - Do I have a choice? - You should definitely go skiing with your kids tomorrow. - I prefer my legs unbroken. - First rule of winning Christmas. - Again with the winning. - Don't stay home when everybody's having fun. - Okay, how many times do I have to tell you, this isn't a competition? - If you say so. - That looks so good. - No, no, no it's gonna be wonderful. - Okay, Sally squirrel it's time to work your magic. Sally squirrel took a big sniff. Mama, are those Christmas cookies? That's right, said mama squirrel, would you like to decorate them with me? Sally squirrel jumped up with joy, I sure would she said and she put her little nose to all the sweets. - Hey, you want it on this action? - Oh, that's okay it's your vacation, makes sense you'd be the ones to tuck them in. - I see you brought your copy too. - Yeah, I see you brought matching pajamas. - The girls are getting a little old for scratch and sniff, but traditions, tradition, right? Mama squirrel smiled, Christmas is almost here she said. - She's a natural, right? - Right in the corner. - There you are I have been looking for you everywhere. - Come to return my robe? - What, no, I realized I may have misjudged the situation slightly. - Oh, yeah, what situation is that? - The Christmas situation. - Oh, so, you admit you need my help? Thought you might come to your senses. - Hold your horses pretty boy, I see how I'm gonna help you. - How are you gonna help me? - By keeping you in the spotlight? - And how is that exactly? - Look I spent my entire life in Kate's shadow, I know a thing or two about how this goes. - All right, I'm in. - Great, I booked you a ski lesson. - What? - Had a feeling you'd come around. - Are you always this confident? - Pretty much, see you on the bunny hill, bright and early. ill was usually at the bottom of the mountain. - You know, you're kind of cute when you're nervous? - I'm not nervous, I'm just not a big fan of heights. - Really because you seem pretty nervous. - No, it's gonna be great. This is so not great. - The lesson hasn't even started yet. Exactly. - It'll be fun I promise. - Fun for you or fun for me? - Hi, welcome to kids on skis so, guys just remember, keep your poles to yourself, Billy looking at you a lot, all right, I'm just gonna need all the adults now, to head on over to the viewing area. - Oh, actually I'm signed up for this class Maggie Collins. - Oh, she's a kid at heart she'll fit right in. - They all are. - Okay, listen, girls, I'll be right over there watching. - Oh, you really don't need a watch. - Oh, I really do. - Excitement. - Is it possible to get a bandage, that doesn't resemble a candy cane? - Sorry. - Well, I think it's festive. - Is it broken? - Oh, it's fine really it's a strain not a sprain. - She should stay off the slopes for the rest of the day. - Well, we can take Sophie and Mia with us and that way you can rest. - I wanna stay with mom. - Ah, I don't know kiddo. - Nope, you can stay with me, we'll just take it easy. - Are you sure you don't wanna come with us? We can ski, grab a bite to eat, go shopping. - I'm sure we can find something fun to do, that doesn't involve skis, right? - You know, I know a spot that has the best hot cocoa, they make their own marshmallows, do you like marshmallows? - I do. - There you go. All right, we're pretty much set, so yeah, we'll meet up with you later. - Just us? - Don't forget the Nutcracker tea starts at four. - Well, I guess marshmallows for the win, guess this means I owe you a pitch deck and the restaurant you're pitching is in this hotel? - Yeah, the original restaurant was through there. - So, what are you thinking for the menu? Sushi, Yakitori, you know, bring some of that, Japanese flare back to Aspen? - No, nothing like that, I want the food to speak to the Inn's history in a way that's honest and authentic. I wanna put my own spin on some of the classic dishes, that were here in the Butterfield's heyday. - Wait a sec the Butterfield Inn, isn't this your family's hotel? - It was. - Were you planning on telling me that? - I don't know, maybe. - Maybe? - Maybe, eventually. - Sam, you just said your whole concept for the menu is about history I mean, it seems like it might behoove you, to include your family's history in the pitch. - Behoove is that a fancy word from design school. - Okay look, you are the one who wanted me to do this deck, the only way it's gonna work is if you've trust me enough, to start sharing the whole picture, okay, who's that guy? - That, oh, that is Skip Whitaker. - Handsome. - He's my mom's grandfather. Legend has it that his father sent him out here, to mine silver, Skip, took the money for the mine and he built himself a hotel. - A rebel? Now, I see where you get it. - That was in 1892, do you know all of the woodwork in here is original? - Wow, really is gorgeous. Wait, so why did your dad sell the place? - My mom was in line to take over the hotel, she passed away and then everything changed. - I'm sorry. - I tried to convince my dad that I could take it over and it would have worked if it wasn't for the fact, that I was all at 14 years old, so, my dad put the Butterfield on the market and the rest as they say is history. - Yeah, that must've been really hard on you and Kate, losing your mom so young? - We handled things differently, you know, Kate, got really close to my dad and me, I took out a map of the world started plotting my escape. - I've never seen so many gingerbread houses in one place. - Right, do you know that when I was your age, my grand mom Mary, taught me how to make gingerbread from scratch? This whole display idea that was all hers. - Can we make gingerbread from scratch? - Oh, bug, you know, I think we better let Sam, get back to his day. - Well I have been meaning to dig out that recipe, family secret, now if I teach you that recipe, do you promise you won't put it on the internet? - I promise, promise. - Promise. Okay, let's bake. You know, we should probably get the roof on before your mom eats all the gum drops. - She does that at home too. - I do not, okay, I do. - The icing's stuck. - Okay, well try squeezing it from the back, like you do with toothpaste. - I'll show you Maggie, you got that? - Okay, how do I? - Oh, you're hands. - Hello, the icing. - I'm gonna let go, all right, see what we got. - All right, kitchen is all yours, just remember three hours until the dinner crew rolls in, cleared a shelf in the walk-in for you. - Oh, thanks man, I'm gonna stick around and test out some recipes. - Why don't you cook at your dad's house? His kitchen is so nice. - Well, I haven't really told my family, about my meeting at the Butterfield. - We'll have to keep it quiet then won't we Soph? - That means you too Charlie. - Oh, I feel like I'm in Eloise. - That's the Plaza mom, look, there's dad and Kate. - Hey, good to see you bug. - Don't mind if I do. - Fun day? - We baked a gingerbread house from scratch. - Really? - Yeah, it was epic, where's Mia? - Here she comes now. - Thank you, thank you. - For what sweetheart? - For letting me get my ears pierced, Kate, helped me pick them out. - Aren't they darling? - You got your ears pierced today? - Yeah, dad said you're okay with it. - Well, she was so excited, we figured no time like the present. - I was a little scared at first but then it happened so fast and it was done and I have earrings. - Oh, I'm gonna need another one of those. - Okay, the food in this place is amazing and I have never seen you, turn down a tray of catering brownies so what's up? - Nothing. - Nothing. - It's just I was planning on taking Mia, to get her ears pierced myself, it was gonna be my big Christmas gift. - I'm sorry, I had no idea, why didn't you say so? - I didn't think I had to getting your ears pierced is a mother, daughter rite of passage, it's right up there with shopping for prom dresses or watching Gilmore Girls for the first time, I have dibs on both of those by the way. - Yeah, I'm not gonna watch Gilmore Girls. - Okay, well maybe you should tell Kate too, just so there's no confusion. - Understood. - Sorry, I'm late, what did I miss? This is quite the production. - The girls are having the time of their lives. - Oh, well, I mean you think this is fun, just wait till tomorrow at the reindeer relay. - The what now? - A reindeer relay it's like a decathlon, where all the events are Christmas themed. - I don't remember seeing that on the itinerary. - Ah, Kate won't mind the add, we used to do it every year when we were kids, the girls are gonna love it, there's team events, there's, there's trophies, you are probably gonna wanna save your energy for the morning. - Oh is that a fact? - You know, Maggie's not really into team sports, I don't think anybody will mind if you sit this one out, that is if we even end up going. - Oh yeah, it's happening. Sam. Nothing has changed since I was a kid. - So, listen there is something I need to tell you, I can't skate. - Oh, well, that's a rethink. - Oh, good, we're finally all here, team Blitzen let's go. - Good luck out there, you're gonna need it. - We don't need luck we have Susan. - It's gonna be fine. - They're going to win for sure. - Okay, team huddle up, do you know what I see, when I look at this team? - Amateurs. - No, I see underdogs and you never wanna underestimate the underdog, it's like Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer, classic, classic underdog, no friends, wasn't allowed to play in the reindeer games, nobody ever thought old Rudy was gonna lead Santa's sleigh but there he is every Christmas, leading those reindeer to victory. - I think what Sam is trying to say is we need to believe in ourselves. - Exactly, look no one expects us to win, so, no one can see us coming now are you with me underdogs? Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. I'm gonna help you get started. - Come on, come on, come on. - Oh, my god, stop, stop. - It's all right, I got you, you got it, you got it, there you go. Now, our last event, slap that Santa. You got this honey. Slap it, slap that Santa come on. - Hey, hey, hey, it's all right, it's okay. - You're gonna do this mom, you can do this. Hey guys, wish me luck. You can do it. - Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie. Go, underdogs. - That was incredible, what a rush, this is going on my nightstand. - Is that where you put all your trophies? - This is my first one. - Come on, that can't be true. - Have you met me? - Listen, I had an idea about the pitch deck, tell me if I'm way off base but what if we included small photos of my family, to Butterfield, too cheesy? - Not at all it's just so sentimental of you, I mean, two days ago you were hiding the fact, it was your family's Inn from me. - I don't think hiding is accurate. - I am just saying it's a shift. - Well, I did practically grow up there. - I know and that's what makes you so perfect for this job, I mean, it's not just any old restaurant to you. - You know running that kitchen it'll be like coming home. Wow, that was cheesy. - That was good like, like goosebumps good. I'm gonna write that down, can I trust you with this? - No, I will be careful. - Very gentle. - Typical Sam, swoops in at the last minute and steals my thunder. - I know y'all take this relay business seriously but come on it's just a trophy. - Hey, it's not about the trophy, he's got Maggie and the girls wrapped around his finger, did you see how much fun they were having? - To be honest I was busy focusing on standing upright but now you mentioned it. - See, why can't I get Maggie to laugh like that? - Oh is this where sore losers hang out and lick their wounds? - Surely you didn't come all the way down here to gloat? - No, just an unexpected bonus, so, do you know where mom's old photo albums might be? - Try that box right there. You remember this? - Yeah, mom loved that star, Dad bought it for their first Christmas together, right? - Yeah, this box is full of old ornaments. - Oh, look at this it's from the year we won state, I scored a goal in the first period you were there right? Mom looks so young there, ah, Christmas isn't the same without her. - You know what I miss? Her toffee. - With the slivered almonds on top. - I follow her recipe every year and it never turns out right, she always made Christmas so special, so warm. how come when I try it it winds up as an itinerary? - Maybe stop trying so hard. - Easy for you to say Mr. flying from Tokyo and make ginger bread from scratch. - Okay, you think dad would wanna put up, some of these decorations? - They're mom's not Susan's. - Yeah but these are dad's memory, I mean, they're ours too. - Maybe it's hard on Susan being reminded of dad's past. - Is that what it's like for you you know, Maggie around? - Well, it's different Maggie and Jeff are still family, I mean, maybe not in the conventional sense but they're still very much in each other's lives. - And you're good with that? - It's kind of a package deal. And you are not helping either, fanning the flames out on the ice all Maggie, Maggie. - Oh, come on, why? I can't cheer on my team? - Sam, you have got her thinking that I'm the enemy, I don't wanna be the enemy, I wanna be part of her family. - Try looking at things from Maggie's perspective, I mean, it can't be easy having a front row seat to the Jeff and Kate show. Maybe she's just trying to figure out where she fits in too. - It's open. - Hey, what you working on? - Oh, last minute project for a client, how's it going with the operation woo the parents? You and Ted looked pretty chummy out there on the ice? - Oh, well I could say the same about you and chef Boyardee. - He was just trying to keep me from falling. - Oh, come on, he's totally into you, every time I look over you two are busy flirting. - Okay, first of all, we're not flirting, we're making polite conversation but even if we were flirting which we're not, how is that a problem? - Well, he just doesn't seem like the type of guy, who wants to settle down. - Really, who says I'm looking for something serious? Relax, there's no there, there. - Hey, is this a bad time. - No, come on in, you wanna go check on the girls? - No, they're fine, Kate has them making reindeer out of clothespins, so, sounds like fun. Sam, Sam, the man what's happening? - Not much just living. - Seize the day am I right? - Anyway, I was gonna head down to Charlie's, I just wanted to- - Oh, please. - Oh, this is cool. - Did you bring ornaments from home? - I know, I know it's overkill right, it's just the girls and I love decorating the tree, it's one of our favorite traditions. - Yeah, it's mine too. - Really, I thought all of the Reynolds family trees, were professionally done? - Well, before my dad married Susan, we always decorated our own. Yeah, Kate and I would always fight over, who got to hang the first ornament. - Me and Sophie, do that too. - Who's Charlie? You were saying that, you were gonna head over to Charlie's place? - Charlie is a buddy of mine in town, yeah, I should probably get going so talk later. - If you want I can talk to Kate, see if you and the girls could hang some of these out. - Nah, kind of like having them in here with me. - I realize your meeting is tomorrow but can we talk about this later perhaps when the sun is up? - Oh no, no, no, no you don't, come on you need to get dressed, let's go we're taking the girls on an adventure. - Kate is taking them snow tubing this morning and I would rather not mess with her plan. - It's fine it doesn't start until 10 okay, we'll be back in plenty of time, really, you always this pokey in the morning? - You think I'm slow? good luck getting my kids out of bed. - Come on mom, let's go. This is so cool. Sophie look. - Wow. - We're not flying on one of those planes, are we? - Nope. - Oh, thank goodness. - That's our ride. - Yeah, who's the pilot Kris Kringle? - Actually I am. - Yeah, like you know how to fly a helicopter? You know, how to fly a helicopter? - Best view in town am I right? - How much longer till we head back? - Well, we got to make a quick pit stop first. We're here to pick out a Christmas tree. - But you already have so many. - Well, this is a special one, this one's for your mom's room so, she can hang, all the special ornaments she brought from home, why don't you guys go on ahead we'll catch up, don't go too far though. - Be careful. - I hope this is okay, I know you were talking about, how much you guys love decorating the tree and it got me thinking. - About helicopters? - No, about Mia and Sophie, they might be missing some of their traditions too, I mean, there's also the added bonus of seeing you in snow shoes. - Okay coach, any pointers? - Well, it's easy just put one foot in front of the other. Not bad. - You know what they say never underestimate the underdog. - Whoa, what's going on in here I am adding stocking hooks, we need one for Sam of course and Maggie brought hers from home which was unexpected, so, that is four more, I have them perfectly spaced out but I'm fine starting over it is no big deal. - You seem a little stressed. - I was supposed to take the girls out, snow tubing this morning but Maggie has them off doing something else. I'm pretty sure I offended her again. - Is it possible that she just wanted to spend some time, alone with her daughters? - Do you think I'm overreacting? - These things take time. - I know, I know, Maggie is such an important part of the girls lives and Jeff's too and sometimes, I feel like I'm crashing their party. - Hey, they are lucky to have you. - I just wanted this Christmas to be perfect, like moms always were. - Well, if it's any consolation, I think you're doing a wonderful job. Now, let me help you with these stockings. - Okay, here. - Daddy, look we chopped down a tree in the real forest. - Wow, another tree that's what this place needs. - Did we miss snow tubing? - Yeah, I'm sorry kiddo, the tickets were timed, why don't you guys run inside and get warm? - Can we have a minute? - Yeah, yeah, of course. - You look mad, don't be mad, I'm really sorry we were late, cable release wasn't working, when we tried to long line the Christmas tree, so, we had to call for back up. - Do you even hear the words coming out of your mouth? - I know, right? - Kate, was supposed to take the girls, snow tubing this morning but you just up and disappeared. - Nope, Hector, knew where we were. - Yeah, but I didn't, I'm sitting at breakfast with Ted, waiting for the girls to come downstairs and how do you think it looked, me not knowing where my own kids were? - So, this is about Ted? - And Kate, she worked her butt off, to make this trip special for the girls and all you have to do was show up and go along for the ride. - Well, forgive me for wanting, to spend a little time with our kids, she has them scheduled 24/7. - Yeah, that's because Kate is organized and responsible, she doesn't just tag along and create chaos. - Me create chaos, you're the one, who wanted to change things up this Christmas, you said all of this in motion and I will have you know, I am quite capable of making plans, I planned to take Mia, to get her ears pierced in Aspen, I called ahead and made an appointment. - Again, with the earrings, I told you it was an honest mistake. - That was my moment to have not yours and certainly not Kate's. - Well, this was supposed to be my moment, my first vacation with Kate's family and your gumming up the works, it's almost like you're trying to screw things up for me. - What? I am only here because Kate practically begged me to come. - Oh, come on, you jumped at the chance and now you're running around making googly eyes with her brother. - Googly eyes what am I 12? - Look, I don't care what you do on your own time but this trip isn't about you, it's about me and Kate and the girls period. - I have the deck to show you if now's a good time. - Yeah, now works, show me what you got. - You're sweaty. - I am sweaty yeah, should I just lose the shirt? I mean, just right off, I can just get rid of it really easily. - Can we stick to business please. - Yes, you got it. - Okay, yeah, this thing between us, it is strictly professional, like I would flirt with you just to make things hard on him. - For who for Jeff? - He basically just accused me of trying to undermine, his relationship with Kate and I have been nothing but supportive, did I make a fuss, when a photo I took of Kate and Mia on Halloween, wound up on Jeff's Instagram feed with the caption my two boo's, no, I did not because I am evolved and mature. - And frustrated. - So, very frustrated. - You know, what really helps that? Smashing little rubber balls against the wall, come on, give a shot, I promise you, you will feel better. - This isn't gonna work. Are you okay? - It's all right, I've been hit in the face much harder, no offense, no. - Does it hurt? - Not really it's okay. - How about I walk you through the PowerPoint. - Right now, right now? - Yeah here. Have a look. - Wow, this is incredible, I mean, it feels like the Butterfield. - Yeah, the woodwork pattern from the lobby is along the border. - Wait did you switch the order around? - Yeah, I think it makes more sense to hit them with the personal connection right from the top, it just really draws them in, especially with those amazing photos you found. But I can change it back if you want. - No, no, no, it's it's much stronger this way, it just kinda hit me you know, I'm actually actually pitching Butterfield tomorrow. - You're gonna knock it out of the park but we should print it out just in case. - I think I know the perfect place. - This is crazy, what if your dad walks in and sees the deck? - And I'll be right outside keeping watch, it's okay. - Everything okay? - All good. - How's it going in there, you good? - Whoa, again, all jumbled up. - Wow, this looks so fun can I borrow you for a sec? - Yeah, we're a little busy here. - Trust me the jingle bell crafting session can wait, you are not gonna believe what I just found in Ted's office, he has a folder on you, it's more like a dossier, he has photos, a background check. - What were you doing in Ted's office? - Did you hear what I just said? He had you investigated Jeff as in private investigated with a capital P and a capital I, I mean, who does that? Who are these people? Do you think he has files on all of Kate's boyfriends? - Probably just the ones who ask if they can marry her. - You're getting married? - If she says yes. - Wow, that's huge. Why didn't you say anything? - I thought Kate should be the first to know. I'm gonna ask her tomorrow night at dinner. - You're proposing on Christmas Eve? - Whoa do you mind keeping it down, I'm trying to keep it a secret here. - Are you sure that's a good idea, just bringing it on the girls? - Well, it's not like we haven't talked about it before. - What, you have when? - A few weeks back, I asked how they would feel if Kate joined the family, they were all for it. Now can I get back to my crafting please? - Yeah, congratulations. - Thank you. - Yep, we're spending Christmas Eve with dad and Kate and you'll be back in time for presents tomorrow, can I go? Susan's letting me rearrange the nativity scene. - Okay, have fun. Don't you wanna reorder the wise men? - I thought we were spending Christmas Eve all together. - I know sweet girl but you're gonna have so much fun, you're not even gonna realize I was gone. - Where will you go? - I am gonna go downtown, I booked a facial at the St. Mark hotel and then before you know it we will all be together, right by that tree. - Actually, Santa visits the tree in the great room, I asked Hector. - Oh, good thinking. Come here, huggy, kissy, see you later. - Hey, hey, any chance you'd be willing, to listen to me practice my pitch? - I would love to but I have an Uber driver coming, oh, come on, Marty Zee, you too, that's the third driver to cancel on me. - Yeah, it's the hill most cars can't make it up, I'm heading the Butterfield in an hour, I can give you a ride if you're willing to wait. - Thank you but I think I'll keep trying. - Yeah, don't wanna be late for your facial. - Word does travel fast in this town? - See, here's the thing, I know for a fact you're not getting a facial. - Says who? - Says Linda, the receptionist at the St. Mark's day spa. See, I called over there and tried to sweet talk them, into giving you a massage, since clearly the last thing you need is a facial. Kate, says you're skipping out on dinner too, true? - Okay, look, I cannot be at that dinner, I need to get out of here now. - It's okay, we'll figure it out do you wanna talk about it? - Jeff is asking Kate to marry him at dinner tonight. - Okay, wow. - Yeah and I would rather not be here to watch it go down. - Wait, so you're gonna spend Christmas Eve alone in a town you don't know not getting a facial? - That's the plan. - Okay, I'm coming with you. - No but the Butterfield? - It's fine I'll tell them something important came up, which is it's true by the way. - No, I cannot let you do this, this is your big shot, your once in a lifetime. - I'll reschedule, I can change my flight if I need to. Unless you wanna be alone. - To be honest, I could really use the company. - Great, it's settled. - Great. Where should we go? - Now, I know it's not a massage but thought you might like it. - This is gorgeous. - It's a pool it's fed by a natural hot spring, lucky for us it's closed for the night. - And you just happened to have a key? - Wow, I know a guy. - What's in the thermos? - Mulled cider to warm us up afterwards. Come on, when's the next time, you'll be at a natural hot spring on Christmas Eve? You're not gonna make me go in alone. Come on. - Oh, fine. Homemade cider, jazzy Christmas vibes, does this work on all the other women you've brought here? - Ah, wouldn't know, never brought anyone here. - Seriously? - We used to come here when I was a kid on Christmas Eve, the cider is my mom's recipe, technically you're not supposed to bring drinks in here but somehow she always found a way to sneak it in. - That's legitimately awesome. - She was magic my mom, she loved it here. - I can see why, so peaceful. - And then we would soak for hours and sit by the fire and wait for the stars to come out. My mom had this thing about wishing on a North star on Christmas Eve, she said it was like birthday candles, eyelashes and wishbones all rolled into one. - No pressure. - Well, you know, for me it was all about BMX bikes and latest video games but for my mom, she always had the same wish, she wished to be as happy year around as she was in that moment. We stopped coming here after my mom died, I guess my dad thought it'd be easier, to start some new traditions. - I gotta say this beats caroling hands down and you know how much I love to sing. - Can I ask you something personal? - Go ahead. - Is the reason you didn't wanna go to dinner tonight because you're not over Jeff? - No, no, not at all, we were so young when we got married, I never been in a real relationship before, you know how everybody always says, you should marry your best friend, thing is that that's all we ever were, we never had that thing. - That thing is important. - It is. - You're sure you're over him? - 100%. - Well will it be okay if I. - Was that your big move? - Well, that depends did it work? Wow, best Christmas ever. - Oh, that's my phone I should get it. - I'll get it, I'll get it. It's Mia. - Hey, is everything okay? Wait, okay, slow down a sec, no, of course, of course I'll be right there, that was Mia, she's at the hotel St. Mark's looking for me. - Ho, ho, ho and welcome to the hotel St. Mark. - Which way's the day spa? - Mom. - Maggie, Sam. She was quite eager to see you after dinner. - I'm so sorry. - Sam, I'll be right back, I'm parked in a tow away zone. - Thank you. - You sure you're okay. - Yeah. - I'm gonna go call your dad and Kate and let them know we're with you. Don't go anywhere. - I won't. - Will you watch her? - Big night huh? You know, I remember when my dad told me, he was getting remarried, a punch in the gut. - Everything just happened so fast and everyone was looking at me. - Like you're supposed to jump for joy and you just heard the news five seconds before. - Yeah, I mean I knew it was coming eventually but now it's real. - Hard to process, I get it. - Hey kiddo you okay? - I'm sorry I left. - That's okay, I'm just glad you're all right. - Mia and I are gonna have a little, one-on-one time in my room, right kiddo. - Oh, hey, I heard you're marrying my sister, congrats mate. - Thanks, Sam, how did she seem to you, Mia I mean? - You know, a little thrown off guard maybe but I think that comes with the territory. - It's the first time she's ever run away, still counts as running away if Hector told us, where he was taking her right? - You know, when I found out my dad was proposing to Susan, I hopped on a flight to Bangkok and spent a month, sweeping floors in a Buddhist monastery, those monks taught me everything I know about curry, I guess what I'm saying is just be glad, she only made as far as the spa. - Yeah, man you make your own Thai food is there anything you don't do? - You look hungry come on, I'll make you something to eat. - You have to promise me the next time you're upset, you won't run away? - But you did. - That's different, your dad and Kate are starting a new life together, I wanted to give them some space, let them have their special moment. And to be honest I didn't think it would be that much fun, watching him propose to someone else. - Yeah, it really wasn't. - Oh, babe I'm sorry, I thought you'd be excited, you like Kate don't you? - Yeah but she's not you, I mean, I like our life, I like how we do Christmas. - I know, change is hard and you have had so much of it lately, new school, new friends, new crushes. - Mom. - You have been such a trooper through all of it, that's why I changed my mind about the earrings, I realized that the reason I was holding on so tight was because deep down I didn't want things to change, if I had my way you would stay my little girl forever, but you've already become this smart and funny, fiercely independent young woman. I think it's time for me to start letting go. - Maybe don't let go just yet. - I love you. - I love you too. Can I come in? These are for Santa but I think we need them more. - I think you're right come sit with us. Hey, I want you two to know, that I am really happy for your dad and I think Kate is pretty terrific too. - You do, since when? - Let's just say I'm working on it. I know just the thing to cheer us up, look who came to Aspen. - Sir Santa-Lot. - Sir Santa-Lot. - I thought he might come in handy. - So, this is where the party's at, I found these in the basement. - Oh, ornaments. - They are the ones we used to hang when we were kids. - How come you don't hang them on one of your trees now? - You know, that is a very good question and I think, I'm gonna have a chat with my dad and Susan about that but in the meantime I thought we could hang out with yours? If that's okay? - Yeah, get them on the tree, so, any word from the Butterfield? - It turns out the owners are flying out tomorrow night, so, might have missed my chance. - Oh no, I am so sorry. - No, no, I'm not. You know, this is the first time, I've been home for Christmas in years, with my mom gone guess I didn't feel like I fit in anymore but this time around feels different. - I'm happy you're here. - Me too. Plus now I'm not the only Christmas crasher so that helps. Mom, look at this, got to see this. - Is that you? - Oh, no, no, that's going back in the basement, come here, let me have that, oh, it's so cute. - Oh, Kate, one of Santa's elves left these gifts, by the wrong tree, I won't be a minute, how are you doing? - Oh, you know, just hanging out by the tree, wondering what I did to make a 12 year old run away. - Mia's crazy about you, you know that right? - I thought we were getting along so well, until Jeff proposed. - I'll admit it was a bold choice, asking you in front of everyone, it shows a certain confidence. Here's what I have learned about being a stepmother, it is not a competition, Maggie, will always be Mia and Sophie's mom and all you have to do is be your wonderful self, Mia will come around eventually. - You really think so. - I know so. - Are those for tomorrow morning? - Yeah, Mia, said something about, missing the cinnamon rolls in Austin. - You know, I'm not one to give you advice, about your love life, I tend to think it's best, to let you figure these things out on your own. - Why do I sense there's a but coming? - Maggie's, a wonderful woman and the sparks between you two could light up a Christmas tree but Jeff and Kate are getting married, which means that Mia and Sophie, are gonna be a part of this family, hopefully for a long time. - You don't think I have what it takes, to make a relationship last right? - Your lifestyle hardly lands itself, to a long-term relationship, you're a chef in Japan, have you thought this through? - It's a working progress. - Let's say you and Maggie do get together and it doesn't work out, would that be fair to the girls? I mean, they got a world of change coming their way, do you really wanna be the guy, that makes their lives more confusing? - I think I liked it better when you didn't give advice. - I bet those cinnamon rolls are gonna be incredible. Don't stay up too late. - Yeah, okay? - Just a sec. Oh, it's you. - Not the man you were expecting? - Yeah, apparently punctuality isn't his strong point. Come on in. - Thank you. Oh, so this is the helicopter tree. - Is that what we're calling it? - I don't recognize some of these ornaments. - They're on loan from the basement. - No, is that Kate? - I think so. - These look good all together. The girls are out like a light. - Yeah, they had a big day, we all did. - I screwed up big time, I should've told the girls I was gonna propose today. - Well, in your defense, Mia, can't keep a secret to save her life. - I know right, where did we go wrong with that one? - That was you. - You think she's okay? - Yes, I think she just needs a little time. - And you, are we good? - I'm gonna be honest, I really wish you would have told me in advance. - If I had you would've stayed home and well Christmas wouldn't be Christmas, I like spending it together. - Yeah, me too. That may have to change. - Yeah, I know. Is that sir Santa-Lot? - Yes it is. - Crashing through the snow in a one man open sleigh. - Okay, now it is Christmas. - Oh, what a cutie. Well, I better get out of your hair, I don't wanna overstay my welcome. - No, yeah like that's never stopped you before. - Touche. Hey, at the risk of overstepping, I just got to say, it's nice to see you getting back out there. - Stop. - No really I'm serious, you've poured your heart and soul into our kids, you deserve to be happy too and Sam's one of the good ones. - I thought you didn't approve? - I've seen the error of my ways. - You don't think it'll be confusing for the girls, Sam's gonna be their uncle and if we start dating, what if it doesn't work out? - Yeah but what if it does, how awesome would that be? - Hector, have you seen Sam, I can't find him anywhere? - He left a little while ago. - Oh, did he say when he'd be back? - Not to me, no. - You know, you look like you could use some cocoa, would you like some cocoa? - Thank you but I'm sure you're eager to get home, to your family. - Yeah, please tell Mia and Sophie, I said Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Mia. - You're giving these to me? - They're hoops not posts so you're gonna have to wait, until your ears are completely healed to wear them but yes they're yours. - Thank you, thank you, Sophie, look what mom gave me. - They're so pretty. - For me? - Wow, that's beautiful. - Go ahead and open it. - This way you will always have them close to your heart. - I love it, thank you. - So, my dad told me that Jeff called and asked for his blessing. - He's old fashioned that way. - I want you to know I had no idea this was coming if I had I would have told Jeff, that he was going about it all wrong, it's just this whole business of calling my dad and asking for permission when the only people, he should've asked, the only ones whose opinions really matter, are you and the girls? So, I sit here before you asking, may I have your blessing to join your family? - Okay, now you're gonna make me cry. - I hope that's a good thing. - oh, yes, of course. - So, we use wrapping paper from every single person. - Well, that way you can remember all the gifts you got. - A little piece for me just fine, it's kind of like a mosaic. - Spoken like the daughter of an art school alum. - Don't even think of touching these, Sam, made them and they're out of this world, where is he, is he still asleep? - I wouldn't know. - What do you mean? - I made a total fool of myself last night, searching the house high and low for him and apparently he went out. - Well, I'm sure he's got a good reason, here you want a bite? They're so good. - Now she's the real deal. Girls, it's time for dinner. - Kate's making a roast goose, she promised I can help baste it. - Oh, then we better get you down there stat. - Sam, where were you this morning? You missed all the presents. - Oh, I wanted to be there Kiddo, believe me. How are my cinnamon rolls? - Way better than Upper Crust. - I ate two. - Two. Listen, I brought you guys some presents, they're in the great room if you wanna go find them. - Yes, thank you. - You're staying for dinner though right? - Definitely. - Oh, thank you. Wow. Are you gonna come down? - I'm not sure, you left me hanging last night. - I know, I'm sorry, I went to the Butterfield this morning, the owners were having breakfast with their family but I convinced them to hear me out. - You did, how did it go? - Good I think they love the idea of honoring the Inn's history and they flipped through deck, especially the picture of me and grandma Mary by the gingerbread display. - You belong in that kitchen, they'd be crazy not to choose you. - Well, they're not making a decision till early January, so, it's a bit of a waiting game but yeah, I feel really good about it. I was an idiot for running out of you last night, believe me I have been regretting it all day. - You missed the floor show, I wore my classy pajamas and everything. - See now you're just being cruel. My mom used to have a locket like that, may I? They're lucky to have you. And I left last night because I didn't wanna make things, complicated for you and the girls but I couldn't let you leave Aspen without telling you, how I feel about you, I like you Maggie Collins, I like you a lot, I like your candy cane microphone, I like your astonishing lack of coordination and I'm pretty sure if I was ever lucky enough, to see those classy pajamas, I'd like them too. - Is that all? - As a matter of fact no not only do I like you, I just really wanna see you again and not just on Christmas. Can I see you again? Does this mean I get a second date? - I think that could be arranged. - Do you want some help with that? - Nope. - Smells awfully good in here. - You don't need to say that. What's this? - Come on, open it. - Mom's toffee with the almonds on top. - It's all about heat management, you've got to pour the toffee on a cold marble slab, and I then found mom's in the basement. - Thank you. - Merry Christmas Kate. - Merry Christmas Sam. Okay, you two, it's time for dinner.
