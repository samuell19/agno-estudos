'Gargi' - What? - 'Don't know how to break this to you' What happened? 'My parents are expecting an Innova car and 15 lakhs in fixed deposit as dowry' 'That's why-' What is this, Pazhani? Even after my father agreed to bear the entire wedding expense Do you need an Innova car now? You know how much he will struggle even for this? I swear I won't trouble my father beyond this 'Hey... hey! Cool... cool' 'I was just pulling your leg' 'In a split second you got so heated up' How can you be kidding about this? 'Idiot! For some unavoidable reason if our wedding gets called off' 'You aren't even bothered that we will break up' 'But you're concerned only about your appa being hassled, right?' 'Anyway, had lunch?' No Only after the exam 'What lunch has your mother packed?' Her favorite 'upma', huh? 'Doesn't my mother-in-law to-be know to cook anything other than upma?'

No one is safe anymore, sir She is just a 9 year old kid As far as I know, this is the third or fourth similar case this year 'How can they heartlessly do this to a young innocent girl?'

Advocates Association has sent me a notice barring me from taking this case Why? Why, uncle? I don't get it This is a case involving a girl child So no member should defend a rapist Sorry, I didn't mean that We should not defend Brahmananda or take up his case in court Uncle What are you saying? What should I do now? I understand, dear, but- I don't know what to do either But as a member I can't take up this case overruling the association policy Uncle 'Sir' 'In 2009, in Screwdriver Shankar case' Similar notice was sent from the association But lawyer Hussain defended and won the case, sir 'He was praised even by our Govt, sir' I won't defy the association and take up this case That advocate has settled down in Malaysia You came to this city completely empty handed 'Even if you earn a bad name it will be your gain' 'But not so in my case' I've earned name, fame, wealth Everything is right here I have to preserve all that Sorry, dear You know my intention is to help you But- Sir, high profile case Why don't we take it up? You can talk whatever you want within these four walls Only the lawyer who defends his client will know Don't teach the teacher! You leave, dear Uncle, think about it please Not only did my father escort your daughter to school He has run errands for you night or day, anytime you called For his sake Help him just once, please Listen, dear Not just media I would have defended your father even if my own family had opposed it 'But I can't break the rules of the association, Gargi' I can't risk my career Gargi, I've gone out of my way to help your father, on many occasions And please remember I got him his current job too Don't forget that 'Madam' Why don't you go to Free Legal Aid Cell? 3rd floor in Civil court It is the duty of the State to see that the legal system promotes justice On the basis of equal opportunity for all its citizens It must therefore arrange to provide free legal aid To those who cannot access justice- Due to economic and other disabilities Why I'm saying this is if we can't afford a lawyer Govt will provide a lawyer free of cost That's what I meant You claim my boss is your family friend How will he pay heed to me when he turned you down? I'm just his junior He won't even respect me What can I do now? Actually even I don't know Only a lawyer who doesn't care about the association's regulations ...will take up this case I think it's going to be really tough - Okay - Also To be on the safe side avoid coming out in public like this Hello? Hello? Hello? Pazhani? I have to call from some random number to hear your voice! I don't know... how to explain? Our whole lives turned topsy-turvy in a single day Okay... okay I understand I don't know what's happening I don't even know what to do, Pazhani No worries We are going to Bangalore I'll manage my family's reaction You bring your mother and Akshara along I don't understand I'm saying let's get married and lead a happy life together - What about my dad? - Are you out of your mind? Even I heard what happened in court So you want me to abandon him just like that? I didn't mean it that way, Gargi The case is very strong According to everyone- 1 minute If this happens to your family will you be listening to hearsay? No, Gargi Listen to my point of view too We have a whole life ahead of us Should we ruin our lives because of this problem, huh? Your lawyer will take care What will you achieve being here?

'We can't be waiting till the police disclose the name' 'My job is to publish the News' 'When you first reported this' 'It has been said you did so based on your own guess work' 'Isn't that wrong?' 'A guess doesn't flash just like that, sir' 'It comes only to a prepared mind' 'Maybe because the 5th accused Brahmananda' '...was working in your apartment were you even more prepared?' 'Not at all, in fact the opposite happened' 'Whomever you ask about Brahmananda in the apartment' 'They will only praise him' 'Then how did you zero in on him as the culprit?'

You're the one assigned to Shanti Apartments case 9 year old girl, PW1 You're following this gang rape case from the beginning, right? - Yes, sir - I object, Your Honor I humbly request PW1 to be first brought to the witness stand PW1 has already identified the accused in a test identification parade So it isn't necessary Yes, Your Honor 'Objection overruled' Thank you, Your Honor - Bennix - Sir Please narrate the facts of the case to the court Okay, sir Accused #1 Mukesh Thakur A hired help in F5 on the floor above the victim's house His owner has a pet dog He takes the dog for a walk daily at 5:30 p.m Pets are not allowed in the lift So he has to use the stairs 'The victim loves dogs' 'So she comes at 5:30 p.m to play with the dog' Mukesh taking the dog for a walk and the victim playing with the dog '...is an established routine' 'Mukesh notices the stairs are always deserted' 'And the victim plays with the dog without her father's knowledge' 'Mukesh shares this information with his friends who work in the same area' 'They plan to use this situation to their advantage' Next evening at 5:30 p.m When the victim comes to play with the dog ...as planned they sedate the victim and take turns to rape her 'They hear a noise, panic and flee' Next day, as per the complaint lodged by her father She was admitted in the Govt Hospital And all the tests were taken Once they knew the police were aware Mukesh and his 3 friends escaped We set up a task force to search for them That's when we got the news they were in Orissa With the help of Orissa police we arrested them At Khurda railway station and brought them to Chennai In Chennai we matched the swab test from the victim and their DNA samples Result was positive But meanwhile Victim's medical condition became unstable 'Since the victim is just 9 years we waited till she recovered' Afterwards we somehow convinced her father According to protocol we held the first identification parade 'In the parade the victim identified the 4 accused correctly' But after the parade Victim ran to her father and whispered something in his ear That was when we came to know there was another offender involved Then we started reinvestigating everything in this case Right from the beginning That's when we got a clue Witness Brahmananda had carried the victim home As per the victim's grandma's statement, the time then was 6:30 p.m But the time the 4 criminals heard a sound and fled was 6:00 p.m So for half an hour 'Only witness Brahmananda was with the victim, no one else' Did you say 'witness' Brahmananda? Yes, sir, at that time he was only a witness Hahn... okay, okay Based on only this, how can you be certain Brahmananda was the rapist? 'It could have been anyone else, right?' Yes, sir, your conjecture is right That's why with the 5 men involved in the crime 'As per protocol, we carried out a second identification parade' 'The victim correctly identified Brahmananda' Clear cut case, Your Honor In the 2nd identification parade Victim has identified Brahmananda clearly Nothing left to argue here Since the crime has been proved beyond reasonable doubt I request the judge to give maximum punishment to the accused Teach a lesson to these animals That's all, Your Honor 'Indrans' 'Do you wish to cross-examine PW-2?' Yes, Your Honor Then come and do the needful [clearing throat] 'What happened? Drink water' It's okay Mr Bennix - When was the complaint lodged? - November 15th Morning around 10:30 - When did the crime occur? - November 14th Between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m Why did you file an FIR 16 hours later? Victim's father panicked because she is only 9 and her life will be ruined That's why he didn't file a complaint Once he knew police complaint was mandatory for hospital admission Then he relented and filed the case, hence the delay Everything has happened to your convenience Then my client's name was missing in the first complaint that was filed - You added it later - Sir- He already mentioned he knew of your client's involvement only later Move to the point, Indrans 'He can move only if a point exists!' DNA... DNA DNA report did not match, right? Yes, sir, it did not match Victim's grandma bathed her and scrubbed her clean So we got very little sample for the swab test - Moreover, Brahmanand- - No DNA, that's your point, right? I object, Your Honor Answers to the Defence counsel's doubts ...have been mentioned in detail in Inspector officer Bennix's report Objection sustained Defence counsel, don't repeat what's already in the court records Yes, Your Honor So when the 4 accused fled on hearing the sound, time was 6:00 p.m The time when my client dropped the victim at her residence was 6:30 p.m This half an hour gap is your only clue With that you've decided my client is the 5th culprit What other clue do you need? I want to know what other clue is needed Ask your client where he was between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m Sir, this day last month between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m Can you remember your whereabouts? You'll ask a silly question like this Then you'll ask the color of the judge's pen! This is not a cinema court to ask irrelevant questions Real court! You need evidence for everything Didn't your senior teach you all this? 'Defence, ask only the questions pertaining to what you want to prove' Don't waste the court time What to do, Your Honor? These half-baked lawyers! They drive us up the wall Where was he between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m? Does he have an alibi? 'Do you know what an alibi is?' Your Honor, Defence counsel's head is devoid of any brain power Nor any evidence in his hands He may be jobless But I am up to my neck in cases How can you say my head is empty? 'As if you opened my head?' Where was your client between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m? Does he have an alibi? Why are you bugging me, sir? Repeating it 100 times! Don't you have any other qu... question? - Fro... from 6:00 to 6:30 p.m - Indrans - From 6... to 6:30 - 'Indrans' - 6:30- - 'What is it?' First sit down please 'Go sit down, Indrans' 'Court officer, give him some water' Brilliant...! Why come to court with such a condition? Mr PP Please 'Yes, Your Honor' Indrans Is there something else or- - Yes, Your Honor - No, you may sit down and ask Thank you, Your Honor 'Check your Whatsapp I'll send her photo' 'Did you see, man?' 'Look how fair she is!' - 'Mr Bennix - Sir' While conducting the 2nd identification parade Can you elaborate on what exactly happened? Yes, sir We summoned the 5 alleged offenders for the 2nd identification parade 'That is the protocol' 'Victim was normal while identifying the 4 offenders' 'Then she got stressed and blacked out' When we asked her father He said his daughter had forgotten to take her usual medication that morning I asked him for the name of the tablet and asked my driver to buy it immediately Luckily my driver said he was taking the same medicine We took the tablet from him and showed it to victim's father, confirmed it Gave it to the victim without further delay She became normal in a short while Only after that, Your Honor Victim clearly identified A5 Brahmananda Report has all the details, defence counsel Yes, Your Honor 'Very good!!' Are you reading it only now? Report has details to the T Go on, read 'Indrans' Yes, sir Report has all the details It is comprehensive Sorry, Your Honor I got a little stuck - Mr Bennix - Sir What is your driver's age? 45, sir How long has he been taking this medicine? He said for the past one year 1 year - Why does he take it? - As if you don't know? You spend half your time in the medical shop? It's fine, sir You tell me He said he takes it when stressed to calm his nerves - For stress? - Defence counsel 'What do you need to know now?' I'm getting there, Your Honor Just 1 minute So he's been taking it for 1 year - Yes, sir - For stress? Yes, sir The tablet you took from your driver ...which you checked with the victim's father before giving it to her What is its dosage, sir? Dosage... dosage You know 500 mg, 600 mg, 650 mg Different quantities That is termed 'dosage' You said the report was in detail 'Your Honor' The child was administered a barbiturate Meant for mental health issues The medicine a 45 year old man takes shouldn't be given to a 9 year old child It's very dangerous 'Even if the dosage was a little high' It could have turned fatal' I object! I object, Your Honor! PW-2, so you did not check the dosage? I checked the medicine's name Dosage- Objection overruled Court officer, arrange for an expert opinion - 'Your name - Dr Senthil' - Father's name - Gnanaprakasham I promise to tell only the whole truth 'Where do you work?' I've been working as a neurosurgeon at BMD Hospital for the past 18 years Hand over the medicine to him Can you elaborate on this medicine? This medicine Belongs to the family of barbiturates It is prescribed for mental health issues It's a scheduled drug You won't get it over the counter in any pharmacy In an unavoidable situation if a child is given an adult dosage ...will there be any harm? In no situation should adult dosage be administered to children If administered it will cause overdose Overdose can cause concentration loss, confusion and lack of focus There will be confusion in making decisions Your Honor, note down this point alone please 'Yes, there will definitely be confusion in making decisions' Sometimes, this can become fatal too Thank you, doctor That's all, Your Honor There is no evidence for the accusations against my client That child was given an adult dosage impairing her consciousness Identification parade held at that time won't hold good on any ground, Your Honor 'What are you blabbering?' Your Honor, don't take him seriously Given a chance he will talk nonstop Only you have the right to talk, huh? He's jabbering nonstop and you're tolerating his nonsense? I'll take care of that Mr PP, maintain discipline in court - What is this? - Should I maintain discipline? Or fight for justice? Indran is justified in his argument too 'Leave it to me I will decide' God knows what you will decide Had it been a normal judge this case would've ended long ago 'How will you- I don't understand anything' Court adjourned First half session is over The child was given an adult dose during the parade I've proved that This PP is trying to mess it up Seems to be moving positively - Lawyer sir, please come - Yes, I'm coming 1 minute 'For having endangered the life of a 9 year old child' This court strongly censures the police for their extreme negligent behavior 'This court recommends strict action against the concerned officer' Do you have any sense? Don't you know how to handle a case involving a minor? Don't you know how to follow child-friendly processes? 'First learn all that' Then you can carry out your investigation 'Now coming to the point' Defence counsel, taking into consideration the gravity of the crime This case cannot be adjourned immediately On the contrary, in order to reinvestigate this case thoroughly Court of law has given 7 days grace time Okay, Your Honor 'To conduct a fresh test identification parade' In front a Tahsildar and myself The court of law orders the police force What did you say in the end? 'Mr PP' If it had been a normal judge This case would have been wrapped up? What you think is abnormal is what I see as a balance I know where it hurts a woman I know where a man's arrogance stems from I know the arrogance of man and pain of a woman Both! I am the best person to decide the case - 'Satyamurthy - Sir' - Appa, how are you? - You can't see him Can't talk to him here Ma'am, let me talk to him for a second They aren't letting me meet appa You can't meet him here Submit a petition at the judicial custody and meet him We've applied many times They aren't allowing us Mr Bennix - Yes, ma'am - Why aren't you allowing them? 'Under trial prisoners have visitation rights, correct?' Why are you blocking them? You messed up the case there You are denying them their rights Shall I recommend the case to CBI? - Make arrangements immediately - Thank you, ma'am They have given us 7 days Another parade will be carried out in front of the Tahsildar and this judge - Judge postponed the verdict it seems - Will there be another parade? 'Being a teacher, don't you know right from wrong?' 'This is your 1st case How was your experience?' Heard you gave the PP a hard time 'Why did you take this case against all odds?' 'Don't you think you were wrong?' 'Lawyer, pharmacist What else do you do, sir?' 'What sin did the child commit?' Why are father and daughter colluding like this? New judge said action will be taken against all including the accused Apparently you're using some point to divert the case [overlap of angry voices] Excuse me, this is a court Maintain some decorum please! Come to crib and complain! Sir Why are you so eager to let a rapist roam free in society? Look here Just because we are quiet doesn't make us guilty! He's a father of 2 daughters I've been with him since my birth for the past 24 years I know him better than you do Let the court decide If he is guilty of the crime or not Go tell the public about the court's verdict News is not what you wish to report but reporting what actually happened My father didn't commit this crime I'm fighting only to prove his innocence If your father gets branded like this will you sit back and watch? Huh? Will you sit back and watch? Note this down Gargi Will you get me ink from the shelf? 'This is a simple fool-proof case' 'And look how you've messed it up' Your aim is to finish the case at the earliest I can understand But why did you write the information about the drug in the report? Sir, it is wrong to miss any piece of information Then isn't it wrong to administer adult dosage to a child? 'Don't use morality for your convenience, Bennix' Enthusiasm alone isn't enough If you lack clarity this is the outcome Now if the family refuses to identify what the heck will we do? Sorry, sir It's my mistake It's his mistake it seems! You got me wrong, sir I'll somehow convince the family and bring the child, sir You don't have to do anything Give him the details and leave I've put in a lot of effort and worked on this case from the beginning, sir I didn't even take off when my child was born Do you understand the pressure I have on this case? I can understand only too well, sir - But what's important now is- - Bennix 'Why are you on the offensive?' How long since your baby was born? 'Sir, 3 months' Okay, I'll suspend you Go and take care of your child? No need, sir, my wife's mother is visiting and she will take care You have a ready answer for this You should have shown this smartness in the case You messed that, right? Sorry, sir, I spoke without knowing I can understand, sir You have pressure from all sides Higher-up calls, media I bungled the dosage and all that But, sir, give me 1 more chance Just last chance My responsibility to convince the family and bring the girl Please, sir, just give me one more chance please If they don't agree? You have your ways, sir Suspension, transfer It's up to you, sir 'Prisoners Interrogation Room' Wait... wait When you meet your appa don't get sentimental And take up all the time I have loads of questions for him Hey boy! Go this side Gargi I'm okay, dear 'Your appa is doing okay' 'You don't worry about anything' 'Did you see the eye doctor, dear?' 'Akshu' What is my 'dosa batter lady' saying? How are all of you? Sir, Gargi lost her job Akshara isn't going to school No one comes to your house to buy 'dosa' batter nowadays Then... someone broke the glass of front right side top window, sir That's the status She is unable to See me locked up like this Sir, the court has given us only 7 days grace time We have to work on this and sort it by then If you can narrate what happened that day It will be really helpful to this case, sir 'I shouldn't have gone to work that day, sir' 'When I saw that child in that state' 'I panicked and did exactly what a father will do' I carried her and ran to her house, sir See, Sara van a, this isn't the time to feel bad about what others will think Admit her in a hospital immediately She is suffering from some internal injury She needs medical care 'Sir' He is right, sir Rush her right away to a nearby hospital, sir Will you please leave us alone? I'll take care I understand, Sara van a But this is my sincere advice You please leave I'll handle this 'After that I left their house, sir' Sir, what was the time when you left their house? About 8:00 p.m What was the time when you took the child back to her house? Around 6:30 p.m, sir 6:30 Sir, did anyone see you when you carried the child home? No, sir No one saw you? - How's that possible? - I was the only one there that day Her house is close to the staircase 'No one uses the steps in the apartment' 'They prefer to take the lift' 'That's why no one can vouch for me' Sir, 1 more question Your duty gets over at 6:00 p.m daily Why were you still hanging around till 6:30 p.m? That is, your usual routine is to go home by 6:00 p.m daily 'What were you doing there, sir? That too all by yourself?' Pcccht! Answer my question, sir I would have left as usual by 6:00 p.m, sir A groom was coming from Nagercoil to meet Sandra formally Her father took off that day So because I had to continue the night shift too Because of that? Indrans Will you let me do my job? 'Continue, sir' He's hesitating to open up because of your presence - Will you give us 5 minutes privacy? - I'll stand here Tell me, sir Evening of November 14th what were you doing 6:00 to 6:30 p.m? Sir 'My duty gets over by 6:00 p.m' 'Correct, sir' 'I will feel like staying back at home and not run these errands' 'What to do?' 'I have 2 girl children' Before I can eat a handful of rice The residents will call me as a handyman to run errands 'My bones will be creaking by 6:00 p.m, sir' 'Because anyway I had to stay behind for night duty' Sandra's father has a stock of brandy always in the lift room I drank a bit because I had time in-between the next shift Gargi doesn't approve of my drinking habit, sir 'Why didn't you tell the police about this during the inquiry?' I went to help that child Look at my present plight If I had confessed then I was intoxicated...?! Sir, understand this clearly We are doing our best to get you out of here What is the use, sir? 'Time is up' How many ever times you ask her to identify That child will point her finger only at me I was the last face she saw, right? 'Your time is up, leave now' 'Gargi' Won't you look at my face even once, my dear? Like everyone else Do you also suspect me? Brahmananda has stepped in for Sandra's father for night shift 2nd point 'From 6:00 to 6:30, some 'Y' has been in the crime spot' 'Most important is the 3rd point' 'If the parade is scheduled I am 100% sure, the victim' ...will identify only your father Until we find out this mysterious Mr Y We must somehow postpone this parade Why is it 'Y'? In this kind of situation usually the suspect is marked as 'X' I decided to be different and mentioned it 'Y' How will all this help us? For starters this will do Only after this we should think a bit like a detective and a criminal Like Sherlock Holmes + Vijay Mallya What's so funny? It's okay, tell me We have to think like Sherlock Mallya! Listen, can we find a way to talk to the secretary of Shanti Apartments? - Anna - Who are you? We want to meet the secretary Why do you want to meet him? We would like to talk to him If you tell us, we can meet him Who are these two? Sec... secretary of this apartment We would like to meet him Haven't you given us enough headache? Clear out Don't come in here Close the gate - Go... go - Sir, please I said 'clear out' Close the gate 'I will close it now, sir' Sir, why did you take off on that particular day? A groom had come with his family to meet my daughter Sandra formally So I didn't step out anywhere, sir I joined back in duty only the next day, sir Indrans! Madam, what a surprise! What brings you here? After that problem, everything changed The entire apartment was shaken up Here, sir Wait, dear Sit here Wait... wait Sit on my lap In that apartment complex Every flat has a maid or a cook Our ears will be the first to hear the slightest hint of any gossip Is there any secret the maids are unaware of? - Do you suspect any on- - No one I can think of What doesn't seem wrong to you may be a helpful lead for us 'Tell us if you know something like that' You take tuition class for my children free of cost You'll be the 1st person I'll tell if I think of something odd - Sir, know Ganesha Murth- - He lives over there Wait for me 'Do you remember me?' 'I am Brahmananda's daughter' Oh! Tell me They told me you're in charge in Shanti apartments Did anyone vacate from there recently? No... not that I know of No, sir I thought I can wrap it up as a secret operatio- Dump your secret operation into the sea! 'Whole world knows now' Nowadays she doesn't even want to look at me, sir She hasn't come out of that trauma 'Only if you have a daughter of your own' You will understand how I feel When she pointed her finger and said 'he did this to me' Do you know how my heart broke? But for your bloody law and justice I would have hooked them and dumped them in the sea I have a daughter too, sir I swear I can understand how you feel inside I messed it up the last time, sir But I won't repeat it again Trust me, sir Even after I try my best, if I fail You can do as you wish, sir 'Yes, sir' 'Sir, we can schedule the parade' 'Yes, sir' 'March 7th, sir' 'Sir' Sir, tea I'll go, buy some green chillies I'll be back in 2 minutes, sir Amma, let me also come with you - Amma, I'll come with you - Why do you want to come? Sir has come only for you He has agreed to teach you without taking a single rupee Go and study, dear You have lots to study, come 'Sit down' Come and sit here Come You look very pretty in this yellow frock What are you looking at? Scumbags like you should be exiled from this city Get out, man! Gargi Whose daughter are you? Can you be scared of all this? If anyone touches you in a wrong way Think of your father for 1 minute Courage will flow through your veins 'Drink this' Is this tea so important now? Pccht! Sorry It's alright A glass of hot tea reduces tension I mean, for me! Something is not right If we take 1 step forward feels like we are moving 4 steps back What is wrong in what we are doing? We are exploring all leads we've got Starting from appa, everyone working in the apartment, paper boy, courier 'Residents, Swiggy, Amazon, this maid' Right up to Ganesha Murthy now we have interrogated everyone We left no stone unturned We forgot one person Hello, I don't think it's right to go there Then you stop right here I'll handle it on my own I didn't mean it like that Are... you aware of the repercussions? I must save my appa somehow That's all 'It is legally wrong to go there' Sir, just 2 minutes, please Your child must have identified my appa by mistake I'll just clarify with her Will 2 minutes be enough? Sir, we understand your pain But still you should see the justice on our sid- Hey! What is the justice on your side, I say? How messed up is your job! My daughter stored biscuits in this box To feed the dog Now it is filled with just strips of medicine She lost her mother when she was very young 'I mean the world to her' She used to come running to me and hug me if anything troubled her When those 5 filthy men- Abus- 'My appa will come' 'He will somehow save me' Wouldn't she have thought that? Those 5 filthy buggers should be dissected to pieces Nowadays I can hear my daughter screaming at night 'It's paining!' I open The door to comfort her Looking at me she screams even louder in anguish Nowadays she doesn't look at me as her appa She looks at me as a man! She might as well have died than go through this torture 'My daughter is a gem' Very intelligent She has never gone for tuition or extra class She is unable to remember even her daily routine now I had to teach her everything all over again In that parade the other day She couldn't identify the beasts responsible for this trauma 'Madam' I thought my child too would grow up to be a young woman like you I don't know if that dream will come true You asked me for 2 minutes, right? Take 10 minutes Go, talk to her Clarify whatever you want Verify whatever you want Thank you, sir - Gargi - No, Indrans sir, I must talk to her How dare you walk into our house after all that has happened? I'll kill you Get out, you bloody female! Are you okay? Or shall we go to a ho spit- 'We were talking and suddenly his brother came and manhandled-' Indrans, will you keep quiet? Gargi- 'What will happen tomorrow, Indrans?' 'She will anyway point her finger at my father, no?' 'If that happens, then-' 'That's it, right?' 'Aiyo!' 'That should never happen' 'Indrans' 'Shall we go to their house just one more time and ask them, huh?' 'Shall we go, Indrans?' 'You... you need to sleep' 'I'll see you in the morning' In the last minute you did something and bought us time previously, right? Similarly, this time also can you do something and try to- Not possible, no? Try to get some rest See you in the mornnn... ing 'Why did you go to their house?' 'That too at this time of the night?' We have to do something, ma So... will you get roughed up by some random man? I don't know what to do, ma 'Enough... whatever you did so far' - That lawyer is an useless idi- - Maa! Stop it He's doing the best that's humanly possible He hasn't even taken a single paisa from me you know Listen Whatever fate has in store let it happen likewise A good conclusion will be arrived at tomorrow morning Aiyo! This is the problem with you, ma I've become tired trying to explain everything to you What 'good conclusion' will be reached tomorrow, tell me? You believe in good time, fate, karma and all that crap But you won't trust me I'm not your male heir, right?! I'm after all a female! 'What is the justice on your side?' 'Your child must have identified my appa by mistake' 'I'll just clarify with her' 'Those 5 filthy buggers should be dissected' 'Leaving this city is the only option' 'She is unable to remember-' 'No girl should face such a trauma in her life' 'In tomorrow's parade' 'I will escort my daughter and ensure she identifies your father' What is this? Submitted new evidence in the last minute? Your Honor, like I have mentioned in my request letter to you I couldn't follow the protocol because I found some evidence in the last minute I request the court to accept this Your Honor, Section 65 B of the Indian Evidence Act Electronic records That is, mobile video recordings like this If it should be submitted in court as evidence An expert officer should certify it Another officer in power should verify That is the law That is the customary procedure we follow But not mandatory Court is keen to know if the evidence is valid or not You may proceed, Indrans Thank you, Your Honor 'My daughter is a gem' 'Very intelligent' 'She has never gone for tuition or extra class' 'She is unable to remember even her daily routine now' 'I had to teach her everything all over again' 'In that parade the other day' 'She couldn't identify the beasts responsible for this trauma' 'I had to teach her even that' 'In tomorrow's parade' 'I will escort my daughter and ensure she identifies your father' 'I swear I will do it, madam' What does this mean? What do you intend to prove with this? Your Honor, we can infer 2 conclusions clearly from this One is victim's father Sara van an Arrived at a pre-conceived conclusion that my client Brahmananda is guilty Secondly, he has agreed in this video he helped his daughter identify my client What we infer from this is, the victim didn't identify out of her own free will She was able to identify only with her father's help is crystal clear This will follow suit in the parade today And the same will follow in how many ever parades, Your Honor Therefore I appeal for cancellation of this parade I humbly request the court to suspend future parades in this case, Your Honor What nonsense! To blabber in the last minute has become this man's habit! - The court can't accept this - 1 minute, Mr PP Wait Play that video once more 'My daughter is a gem' 'Very intelligent' 'She has never gone for tuition or extra class' 'In that parade the other day' 'She couldn't identify the beasts responsible for this trauma' 'I had to teach her even that' 'In tomorrow's parade' 'I will escort my daughter and ensure she identifies your father' 'I swear I will do it, madam' You are trying to imply it is preconceived notion? - Yes, Your Honor - 'Alright' - Court officer? - 'Yes, ma'am' At 12 noon organize a fresh identification parade Don't involve the victim's father 'Arrange for a welfare committee officer to escort the child to court' 'Okay' APPPAAAAA! Your Honor So far in this case The parade report was the only evidence they had against my client That too, a parade conducted on unlawful grounds I've proved all this in the previous session But the Honorable Court gave them another chance to conduct the parade And it was proven in court, the victim could identify only with her father's aid Again the Honorable Court gave them a third chance You witnessed the drama with your own eyes I can understand Young girl It is such a helpless situation But doesn't the same apply to my client? 'He is 60 years old' 'Father of 2 girls' Both Press and Media have maligned him and his family round the clock And literally exiled them from society For the sole reason, he has no alibi from 6:00 p.m to 6:30 p.m 'How long can we continue to drag this case?' How can we decide on a verdict based on just public sentiment, Your Honor? Isn't that wrong? Don't we need proper evidence? Don't we need evidence, sir? Do you have any other evidence? No, right? Why should my client be in jail for a crime someone else committed? Your Honor, I humbly request you to dismiss all the accusations against my client And release him on bail at the earliest 'You want him roaming free?' How can you expect that, I say? Your client is guilty I know! It's not what you know, sir It is what you can prove That's how court works I agree the victim didn't identify him But at the same time neither did she say it was NOT him 'More importantly' There were hassles in court proceedings because of Mr Sara van an So the interrogation will continue once the victim comes Your Honor, how long can my client be imprisoned because of that? Fine, I will grant conditional bail to your client 'But again in the parade' If the victim identifies him We will cancel the bail and take him back into custody Ask him to sign daily in S5 police station Thank you, Your Honor - Gargi? - Appa? Where's Akshu? 'I sent her to buy milk' Let me go check 'Gargi, you keep talking to your father, I'll go and-' 'What do you want me to say?' 'No, you tell me what I should say' I've come out with my family and you are torturing me even here Then imagine the extent you would have tortured that child and her family 'How will they co-operate then?' 'You are a reason too for this case not being wrapped up' 'Bear that in mind' Anyway if the victim comes, the parade can be scheduled Only then the case can reach a conclusion Till then let everyone enjoy some peace and privacy Driver, reverse This case is in a delicate situation 'Mr Sara van an has planned to relocate elsewhere with his child' 'He has decided not to co-operate with the court proceedings' 'Due to lack of any other incriminating evidence' 'Accused Brahmananda's release is almost confirmed' 'Does that mean he was wrongly framed?' 'Did the affected child' '...identify Brahmananda only in a state of confusion?' 'With cameraman Deakin Rogers this is Ahalya reporting' 'I told our boss right in the beginning' Let us report after investigating thoroughly Obsessed with Flash News he gave me sheer hell Look how humiliating it is now It isn't our fault, ma'am If the investigation had been conducted properly The police could have nabbed the 5th criminal long ago They botched it and pressurized the poor child unnecessarily 'So sad! Wonder who that child misidentified' Okay, da, life will come back to normalcy I'll go home What, appa? I heard you wanted to shift from here? Amma told me about it But don't we have to adhere to signing at the police station daily? Alright, let's leave this city as soon as the case is over, okay? Uncle Uncle 'Tell me, dear' 'Don't hesitate' Which brand of alcohol does appa prefer?

Come, let's step out for a while No, you go I'll come another day Don't make a fuss - Come on - I'll take this Come I've put him to bed, dear He drank very little But it has been a long gap, right? I think he got high too soon 'He kept talking about you' 'Blaming himself for the hassles you faced' 'He wants to vacate this house at the earliest' We'll shift, uncle But we have to wait for the case to be closed He doesn't understand that I feel bad when I think of him, uncle I should find a job for him far away from this area Don't worry about that, dear I'll spread the word around We can get him a job definitely It's okay, uncle, I'm sure you have a lot on your mind Sorry, dear I should've visited you earlier and been of some help I panicked at all that happened It's alright, uncle Appa doesn't have any other close friend Visit us often till things get back to normal, uncle But next time I won't agree to this drinking bout Don't you worry He is blessed with you as his daughter purely due to his golden heart But that same God is giving you a hard time I want appa with me That's all, uncle I'll do whatever I can for that You ask Sandra if you want She would have done the same for you 'She is very clear headed' She eloped with her classmate last week and got married - Sandra? - 'Yes, dear' 'She is an adult it seems' She said she knows what to do with her life and ran away from home But you had found a groom for her, right? 'Oh yes!' 'I did everything I should as a father for my daughter' The groom I finalized had a secure bank job I took off the whole day and arranged every detail possible, dear 'The groom-to-be came with his family to meet us' 'You know what she said when she saw him?' 'I am in love with someone else and I will marry only him' She made me hang my head in shame in front of everyone, dear I lost my cool and slapped her left and right 'In that distressed state I got drunk as a skunk, dear' I agree what Sandra did was wrong, uncle But how does getting drunk and hitting your child resolve anything? Maybe you could have solved it if you had sat down and spoken to her? Your father gave me this same advice that day over the phone 'I was so mad I wanted to go home and beat her to a pulp' But your appa consoled me and calmed me down Until I become sober he asked me to lie down in the apartment I silently dozed off, dear 'Sir, a groom had come with his family to meet my daughter Sandra formally' 'So I didn't step out anywhere, sir' 'I joined back in duty only the next day, sir' Sor... sorry, dear Give me the bail order copy Sign here Give me your ID card You have to sign too Sorry, dear 'I should have told you earlier' I was scared but I shouldn't have done that You are the cause of all my father's problems I'll call the police - I'm calling the police - Wait, please listen to me Please, dear 'I will fall at your feet and beg you' Please, dear Hear me out 'Listen to me' Sign Sign as 'Daughter of' 'That day I went to the apartment because your father called me' 'When I was taking the steps to go up, I heard a sound' 'I was the first one who saw that child lying semi-conscious' 'I was shell shocked I didn't know what to do' 'My limbs went numb and my mind went blank' 'I managed to go up to the terrace' 'And told your father about the gruesome sight' He said, 'don't whisper a word to anyone, to top it all you are drunk' 'The case will be foisted on you' He said, 'go sit in the lift room' 'He carried the girl to her house' 'He did all he could to help that poor child' When I was leaving the apartment the next day Brahma called me and said 'If anyone asks you about this' 'Tell them you were at home waiting for the to-be groom's arrival' He asked me not to say anything else 'A groom was coming from Nagercoil to meet Sandra formally' 'Her father took off that day' What were you doing that evening between 6:00 and 6:30 p.m?
