Hope I'm not interrupting? - No, no, no, no, I'm just gettin' a, gettin' a headstart on my sermon for Sunday, so. - Oh, good man, good man. - Yeah. Uh, you wanna talk about something? - Yes, I just wanted to see how you're settling in? - Yeah, well, it is, it's been wonderful. Megan and I are feeling right at home, and-- - Good. - Got a wonderful reception from the congregation on Sunday after the sermon, so, it's been a really wonderful experience, thank you. - Glad to hear it. Glad to hear it. So, look, since you're a first-time pastor, I thought I would let you know a little bit about, well, our vision for the church. - Absolutely, yeah. - You see when our old pastor left, the elder board wanted to find somebody who could, well, keep things moving around here. Absolutely. - I mean, this church has been around a very long time, and the congregation feels safe and comfortable in the way we do things. - Sure, sure. - So, we want do whatever we can to help carry that on, not shake things up. Can I count on you? - Absolutely. - Good. - You hired the right man for the job. - Glad to hear it. Okay, well, I'll get outta your hair and, oh, I'm also really looking forward to hearing how that Wednesday night Bible study goes. Me too. - Okay. - All right. - All right. - Hey, thanks for stopping by George. - You're welcome. - Hey. I thought that was you up here. Hey. - Last night was fun. - Yeah, yeah it was pretty cool. - Whatcha reading? - Some book someone threw out, man, nothing special. - Okay. - Yeah.

Um, by the way, would you like some tea? - I would love some. Okay, I'll be right back. - Great. I love this photo. - Aw, thank you, that's from our honeymoon. - You guys are perfect. I don't know about that. But were and are very happy. How long have you two been together? - Goodness, it's been six years next month. It's crazy, time flies. But you wanna know the funny thing? - What's that? - He still makes me laugh like that all the time. We're still pretty crazy in love. It's a little ridiculous. - Hmm, there was a time when Chris and I looked just like that. - Wait, what do you mean? You don't feel like that anymore? You guys look happy. - Oh, no, Chris and I are very much still in love. But... - It's just been a little bit of a challenge, you know, settling in. I mean, that's, you know, only natural. Yeah, no, of course, that makes sense. - Yeah. I think he's just, you know, wanting to make a good first impression, making sure that everything works. - Right. Right, and I understand, but how are you? - I'm fine. You know, everyone has been super welcoming. Just fine. - I'm, I'm hanging in there. I don't think I really understood what it meant to be a pastor's wife when we met in college. - Oh yeah, that would be, a lot. A lot to deal with. But, what's your story? I don't know, tell me. - Well, I mean, it's kind of a cliche. Well, I grew up in a really small town like this one. And, you know, I never thought that I would come back to a place like this, but here I am. I'm glad. - And, um, you know, I knew that I wanted something big for myself, but I didn't really know what that looked like and then I met Chris in school, and he was unlike all the other guys. He had a vision for his life and he was such a great encourager. Like, he, he was always rooting for you. Even when you weren't rooting for yourself. It's so attractive, and he, um, you know, he's a pastor's son, so, his dad was a pastor, and his dad's dad was a pastor, and he just wanted to - Wow. - Really continue this legacy, you know? - Right. - And follow this vision for his life, and I wanted to be part of that, it was so exciting, and, um, you know, so, and we've always been so close. - Do you not feel like you are now? - No, I do, it's just that he, I think sometimes he's just, kind of hiding behind this mask. Like he's scared to show the world who he really is. No one can really see him, but, I can tell that something is going on and maybe it's just because he wants to make a good impression or because he's, you know, a first time pastor or what? But... But? - I'm afraid that he will get caught up in this image and not really know how to escape it. And, that I won't be able to live up to it and that I think I won't be enough for him. - No, oh, that is crazy talk. Seriously, that's crazy, I'm sure he loves you so much. It's probably the stress of a new job in a new place, that's a lot. - You're right, I'm probably totally overreacting and that's not what he needs right now. - Well, maybe, but I mean, you need to be able to say how you feel, and maybe he needs to hear it. - I'm sorry for, you know, pouring all my stuff on you. - Oh, no, no, seriously, you're great. Are you kidding, I am so happy to have another girlfriend that's under the age of 65 in this town. So, we're gonna be good friends, you don't have a choice. - When did you become such a good therapist? Oh, well, when you've grown up the same town your whole life and you've gone to the same small little church, you kinda get good at listening and reading people 'cause there's not much else to do. - Well, I think you have discovered your calling. Oh, thank you. By the way, do you eat gluten? - Um, yes. - Good, I never know with the out of town people these days. Oh, would you like some freshly baked cookies? Goodness, yes, please. - Oh good, oh good, okay. I thought you could use a couple. I'll be right back. - Okay. - Ha, ha, there he is, my man. Dude, you coming tonight? It should be lit, man. We got a handle, we're gonna need your help, bro. ♪ Uh, uh, uh, uh - You're crazy, bro. Eh, you know what, Mike? That sounds fun and all, but, man I need to rest up, bro. - Ah. - I gotta get through the rest of this week, dude. - All right, man, that's cool. - Yeah. Take it easy, man. - All right, man. Have fun, be safe, bro. What's up man? - Hi. - Is there a Bible study here? - Yeah, we're just downstairs. - All right, cool, thank you brother. Yeah. - All right, I'm so glad you guys are here. We're gonna have a great Bible study. So, let's open to Jeremiah 29:11, and Rick over here is gonna read it for us, do you mind? - Yeah, no problem. For I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord. Thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an expected end. - Uh, hi, can I help you? - Uh, yeah, I saw a sign outside, I'm here for the Bible study. - Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, take a seat, take a seat. Okay, well let's keep on going. So, God knows the plans that he has for us, and they're plans of blessing. He doesn't want us to go through bad things, so, um, uh, okay, yeah, um, so, anyone, any thoughts? - Sam. - Oh, Pastor Chris. - Yeah, so I saw your sign outside, and, I just wanted to see what you guys were doing in here. I'm never been in a church or anything, but, some of the stuff you said was cool. Appreciate it. - Um, well, I'm glad you liked it, Sam. - Yeah, yeah, oh. Thanks for letting me borrow it. - You know what, it's yours. Have a good night. Oh. - Hey, how was Bible study? - Hey. I honestly have no idea. I'm just hoping I'm doing what they want me to. I'm sure you're doing great. - Well, it's important that they like me. I mean, you know, for us, so. - Well, I like you. - Thank you, but you know, it's important what they think. - I know, I know, I'm just-- - Hey Megan, I'm so sorry. I have to, I got a lot of work to do, just get ready for, ready for Sunday. Do you mind if I kinda, just focus a little bit? - Sure. - 'Kay, thanks. - I musta missed you last night. - Yeah. I was out a little later than normal. Where were you? - Just some meeting. - A meeting? - Nothing big. - Okay, well, I was thinking that maybe you could come over tonight and watch some TV. Could see what happens after that. Yeah, that sounds great, but, it's just-- What is it? - Look Ash, I've been reading some stuff, man, and, I just wanna respect you the way you deserve. - Look who's all of a sudden decide to become a saint. - Yeah, I'm no saint. But I'm definitely sorting some stuff out in my head. Well, when you figure it out, let me know, okay? - Yeah. - Sam? Yeah? - You'll find it. What's that? - What it is you're looking for. - Yeah, I hope so. Hope so. ♪ We thank you Lord - Oh, thank you so much, Jeremiah, that was wonderful. Welcome, we're gonna have a wonderful time with God today. Well, let's open our bibles to Matthew 7:7. Today, um, uh, we are going to be talking about God's blessing, and how we can find it in our own lives. All right, um, I'd like to share a little story and we will jump right into it. I used to, when I was a young boy, I used to, I used to think that, I could never grow up to be something great because I didn't. - Hi, thanks so much for coming. - Hi, oh it was so wonderful to hear you. - I hope you enjoyed it. - Great sermon, Chris - Oh, thank you so much. - Oh, hey, I hear wonderful things about your pies, and I hope to have one - Yes. - At the next potluck. - Oh, one just for you. - Oh, great, I can't wait, thanks so much for coming guys, we'll see you soon. - Bye, have a good day. - All righty. - Hi, good morning, Megan. - Hi. - George. - Chris, great sermon. - Oh, thank you so much, I hope so. - We really enjoyed it. In fact, if things keep going the way they have been, we'd like to make this a permanent thing. - That would be wonderful. - Oh, that's amazing. We'd love that. - Great, great, Chris, can I speak to you for a moment, just really quick. Of course, of course, okay, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hey, I didn't wanna - Hey, it's nice to - not say hi. - See you again, hi. How are you? - You know, Chris, part of being a pastor is watching out for your congregation. - Yeah. - Keeping them safe from, you know, unwanted characters. - I will. - So, then I'll leave it up to you to, well, do the right thing. Can I count on you? - Yeah, I got you. - All right. - Yo, hey, Pastor Chris. - Hey, hey, how's it going? From Bible study right? Yes sir. Remind me your name again. - Um, Sam. - Sam, Sam, uh. Sam, you been in town long? Yes sir, for a while now. - Okay, okay, and can I ask what brought you in here today? - Well, I'm kinda curious. Wanna know what this is about. What you're about. - Yeah. Well, we are a community of people just trying to serve the Lord. - Hmm, find that interesting. - Yeah, you know, our congregation has come to expect something kind of particular in their house of worship, and I'm really trying to give that to them. - What does that mean? - Listen Sam, church isn't for everyone. - Like for me? - Yeah, you know, maybe this just isn't the right place or fit for you right now? - You know what, I better get going. Uh, thank you for your sermon. - Okay, yeah, yeah. - Um, I should give this back to you. - You know what, it's all yours, keep it, on the house. Hey, thanks for coming though, okay? - Yeah, thanks for having me. - Hey you. How are you? Megan, what's going on? Megan? - Who was that guy there today? - Who are you talking about? - It's just some guy, all right, he's nobody. Megan, look, the reality is, if I wanna keep my job here, I'm gonna have to do some things that might make you feel uncomfortable. - And that includes telling certain people to go? - If they don't fit in, then yes. - That's weird, I thought those were the kinds of people that Jesus wants there. - Yeah, I think I might know a little more about this than you do Megan. - You know what, you're right, you should, and that's what's starting to worry me. - Okay. Chat and watch the hottest girls at. Megan. Hey, Megan just come back, stop. It's not what you think, can I just explain, Megan? Come on. - Hmm. God, Now can you just, can you just be here? Can you just be here right now? Thank God could you just please? Could you just show up for him please? Would you just remind him who he is? To you? To me? Boom. Boom. - What can I do for you? - Can, I guess? - You look like you need a double. There ya go. - Oh. - Woo. - Another. - Drinking some pain away. Yeah, something like that. See ya in a few. - You're not from around here, are ya? - No, I'm fairly new to town. - Oh yeah? So, what brings you here? Job. Job, mm-hmm. What kind of work you in? - I um, I'm a pastor. Really? Is that right? You know we don't get too many of you guys in here. - I bet. - So, what's the story, pastor? - Still trying to figure that out to be honest. - You know, the last time I was in church, I was probably, eight years old. - Why haven't you been back? - Ah, if I tried to cross through those doors, I think I might burst into flames. Poof! - You know, well here I am crossing through yours. What's gonna happen to me? - Well pastor, that's a wonderful thing about bars. Everybody's welcome. No questions, no rejections. - Yeah. - Now, I could be wrong, so, correct me if I am, but wasn't it Jesus Christ who turned water into wine? - Yes it was. My kinda guy. - And It's his followers you're not so hot on, huh? - Well, church is good. For good people, pastor. I realize a long time ago, not my bag. - You think we're good? - Pastor, no one's good. None of us. We all need help. I think the only thing that separates the good guys from the bad guys is where we look for that help. Make it last. That one's on me. - Megan, please just pick up. Megan, I need to talk to you, okay, listen. I can explain, it's not what you think, Megan, I love you. I'm coming home, all right? - Eh, excuse me sir? - I'm gonna be-- - You shouldn't drive drunk. I should call you a cab. - Dude, mind your own business, okay? - Eh, you should drive drunk, man, let me call you a cab, bro, come one. - Dude, back off, all right! - Eh, don't touch me, man! Give me your keys, I'm-- - Dude, back off! - Pastor Chris? - Oh, come on. - What's the deal, man? - Man, I need to get-- Come on, come on, come on, come on, up, up, up, up, up, up. Man, what's going on, man? - I gotta, man, I gotta, I gotta go, give me, where's my keys? - Nah, nah, nah. I got your keys, brother, you ain't driving nowhere. You kidding me man? Come on, brother? Man. Don't worry about it, I'll getcha home, man. - I got it. I gotta go home, man. - I'll getcha home. Of all the people that I see drunk in an alley, psst, you'd be the last one I though, man. - Oh, come on. - It's all good, man. I'll getcha home. Don't worry about it. - All right, up here-- - All right. Up here you're gonna, you're gonna take a left. All right, all right. Man my wife is so beautiful, man. You have a wife? - Nah, nah. No kids, no wife, man. Nothing. Maybe that's better, man, I don't know. I don't know. I wish I had someone, man. So, you know, maybe you gotta fight for what you have right? - Yeah. - Yeah. This is not a night I would like to repeat. Eh, then don't do it. I've had plenty of those nights, man. Why are you being so nice to me, bud? Eh, I don't know. It's all good man. We all make mistakes, so, yeah, it's just how it is, man. Yeah, not me. Yeah. Welcome to the imperfect club. Um. You're gonna take. Take a right up here. All right, man. This is it, you gotta pull in right here. Right here. - Yes sir. All right. Oh, I see it, I think I see it. Good luck, brother. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. All right, here we go. Hey, man, cheer up, man. - Yeah. - You'll bounce back, bro. We'll see. Where we going? Uh, go where I'm staying, man. We're gonna go to my place. Can crash with me, bro. Don't worry about it. Stuff happens, right? To your right. We're almost there, man. Man, this does not look like a nice part of town. Don't worry, you're with me, man, you're straight. That is never never been in this part of town. Yeah, you should come out a little bit more often, man. - Yeah. - There's a lot of people that need help here. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, apparently that's me tonight, man. Nah. I guess not, but I've seen plenty. Like you. Seen plenty. Worse. Here it is right here. Almost home. Ashley probably hates me. I don't deserve her man, I don't deserve her. Yeah. That's the story of my life, man. All right, man. This it? End of the line right here baby. 'Kay. Let's go, man. Better now than never. All right. - Thanks. Something, man. Hey. Mind if I sit? - Nah. Have at it, man. - Oh, no, no thanks. - This is my last pack, man. - Good for you. Mm. - Hey, um, listen, why'd you help me last night? - Psst. 'Cause it look like you needed some help. Yeah, yeah, but why you? - Why me? - Man, I kicked you out of my church. You found me in the dirt, you didn't kick me. You helped me, why? - Why not? Look, I'ma be real with you. That book you gave me, man. - Cheap ol' pew Bible from church? - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. That's it. Yeah. Started reading it, and going through some things in my head. Why not me? Look, Pastor Chris, I'm gonna shoot it straight with you, man. Man, I never knew my parents. I was abandoned at three. In foster homes until I was 16. When I turned 16, I remember running out the foster home doors, man. And I just kept running and running and running, 'til I was exhausted, man. I dropped and I was crying. Just crying out for help, man. No one would come. I don't know who I was crying to but I was crying, man. Shortly after I fell into a lot of issues. The street life came easy, man. Done a lot of things I'm ashamed of. As I'm reading that Bible, it said, some things about this Jesus guy. Look, I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of, man, but Jesus says I can be forgiven for 'em. As I kept reading, it said that God loved me, man. Look, man, I don't even know what that means. But I figured, why not do my best to try to do the same? Why not? This is do or die, Chris. This is do or die, man. So, I remember just running and running my whole life, man. Psst, maybe I was running from God. I think I finally found what I've been looking for, man. - I, um, I. - You know what? I wanna say, thank you. If it wasn't for you, Pastor Chris, I wouldn't have found this, man. - You're welcome. Oh, hey, um, want it? - Keep it, it's yours. Thank you. You knew all along, didn't you? You knew that as I came up here, every Sunday, my perfect clothes, and my perfectly rehearsed words, who I was beneath the skin. A broken man. And I stood there, and I made sure that everyone in here looked and played the part of a good person. And I looked and played the part. And I kicked out probably the most pure-hearted of us all. That makes me wonder, would I have kicked you out? I don't wanna be that man. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. - I heard from a very good friend of mine, that last night, he and his wife, passed a man that looked very much like you, Pastor Chris. They said this man was outside a bar, appeared to be drunk, and ended up going home with some low-life, now I don't-- - It was me. - That doesn't sound like the man we've come to know. - No, not it doesn't, but it was. - You know, Pastor Chris, part of church is keeping up appearances, and helping our community look its best. - But George, what if it's not though? What if it's not, I mean, it says in the Bible, the man looks at the outward appearance and God looks at the heart. What if we've got it wrong? Wrong? - Yes. What if we come in here pretending to look good and we think this is how we're supposed to be, but really the church is supposed to be a place for broken people to find help? - Well, I'm afraid that in this community, that is simply not what we want. Or, are looking for. Regrettably, we are gonna have to let you go. - I understand. - Where have you been? - I, um, I was with a friend. - Is this not enough for you? I mean, am I not enough for you, do you, do you actually love me at all? - Megan, of course I love you. - How long? How long, Chris? - It's too long, okay? - That's not an answer. - I wanted to tell you. - Why didn't you? - I think I um, I couldn't face the man I was becoming. I didn't want you to see who I really was. A broken man. - We're all broken, Chris, okay, but that' not an excuse. - Yeah, but I'm a pastor. I'm supposed to be the good one. - Okay, no one is good, not one. - Are you quoting scripture to me? - Don't. I didn't even want you to come home last night to be honest. A part of me still doesn't want you to be here at all. You have completely broken my trust, as your friend, as your wife. The only reason we're even having this conversation is because I still have some kind of hope in the man that I know you can be. I know that this is gonna take time, but we all need help. - Even pastors, huh? - Especially pastors. - Megan, I'm sorry. Truly, I'm sorry. - I know. I love you. - I love you too. ♪ I need Thee every hour ♪ Most gracious Lord ♪ No tender voice like Thine ♪ Can peace afford ♪ I need Thee, oh, I need Thee ♪ Every hour I need Thee ♪ Oh, bless me now, my Savior ♪ I come to Thee ♪ I need Thee every hour ♪ Stay Thou near by ♪ Temptations lose their power ♪ When Thou art nigh ♪ I need Thee, oh, I need Thee ♪ Every hour I need Thee ♪ Oh, bless me now, my Savior ♪ I come to Thee ♪ I need Thee every hour ♪ In joy or pain ♪ Come quickly and abide ♪ Or life is vain ♪ I need Thee, oh, I need Thee ♪ Every hour I need Thee ♪ Oh, bless me now, my Savior ♪ I come to Thee - I used to think I knew what a good person looked like.

A Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho, and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his clothes, beat 'em up, and left him half dead beside the road. By chance, a priest came along, but when he saw that mean lying there, he crossed to the other side of the road, and passed him by. A temple assistant walked over and looked at him lying there, but he also passed by on other side of the road. Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him. Going over to him, the Samaritan soothes his wounds with olive oil and wine, bandaged him up, and then he took the man on his donkey to an inn, where he took care of him. The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins, telling him, take care of this man, and if his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay for it the next time I'm there. Now which of these three, would you say was a neighbor to the man that was attacked by the bandits, Jesus replied. And then the man replied, the one who showed mercy. Then Jesus said, yes. Go and do the same.
