present a movie co-financed by The Polish Film Institute Starring Folk Art Crafts - Does he live alone? - Yes. - Sure? - I've checked it. Nobody will care. Nice house. But what shall we live on? Yes? Are you here about the land? A Juliusz Machulski film LULLABY Screenplay by Art Direction Costume Design Makeup Editing Sound Music Production Manager Executive Producer Co-producers Cinematography Producer Directed by - Sign an acknowledgement receipt. - Why? - It's a registered letter. - From who? A social welfare worker will visit you. - What for? - How could I know? Nice bike. Yeah. They've bought them recently. I'm going to ask you a few standard questions. It's an environmental inquiry. They'll calculate the money you're entitled to. - How many children do you have? - Four, expecting the fifth. Let's count it as a family member. - Father? - Father-in-law. - How old are you? - More or less is better? - Telling the truth is the best thing. - 550. 550 - it's your pension. He's 80. - You look younger. - Everyone says so. Any income except from the sale of art crafts? Our needs are modest. I'll check their teeth. And their hair. God! You scared me. - Saint Christopher? - The patron saint of drivers, travellers, coachmen, taxi- drivers, porters, knights, treasure hunters, sailors, milliners, raftsmen and runners. - And? - That's all. And railwaymen. Now tell me. Which saint killed the dragon? - George? - You should know, not ask. - At your age I knew all saints. - There were less of them then. But I learnt voluntarily, not like you. The last one. What's his name? Mr Roman Ĺ So he'll contribute to the church renovation. - Praised be Jesus Christ! - For ever and ever. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. - What's his name? - Kuba. Jacob! Resembles the parents. His teeth start growing. How old is he? Next week he'll be one year. He likes you. I can see it. He gets more lively in my arms. Healthy? He was ill recently, but is better now. You should take care of children. One unguarded moment - cold, complications. Do you want to hold him? Be careful. Don't drop him. Have a seat. - Where's the previous owner? - He left. Strange. Said nothing. I don't remember you living here. We lived in the neighbouring commune. - Why did you decide to move? - New place, new challenges. We looked for permanent place, and probably found it. Right. Nice surroundings. Do you manage somehow? Yes. If only we were healthy. Health is the most important thing. And serenity. Then the other things will come too. Oh, there's also a senior. How are you? Well, not complaining. Only my legs hurt a bit. They went through a lot in life. - And stood too. - Sit down, dad. - Would you like some tea? - Yes please. God bless you. When? Before he realises that the envelope is empty. - What about the acolyte? - What? Can I? 300, 400, 500, 600, 700. O. K? - Do I have to give mine? - No, keep it. Where is Mr Roman, still in the sanatorium? - No, he left. - Did he? - On a trip around the world. - Nice. Here are new examples. Make one hundred of them. What about Easter Eggs? They are imported from China this year. - How come? - What, don't we have hands? - Probable 'cause they're cheaper. - Is that possible? Probably. - Say hello to Mr Roman. - When he's back. - Good morning. - Good morning. Are you the owner of this estate? - I'm Mr Steinbach's interpreter. - Yes. - He wants to buy your house. - It's not for sale. - How about the land? - The same. He wants to pay well. It's good business for you. - The land is infertile. - Have you got a pen? - Pen, please. - Here you are. Write: Not for sale. Neither house nor land. Yes, Masuria... My grandma was born here... Beautiful woods, lakes... What are you looking for here? Grass, trees... I'll build the hotel, one, two. You have to invest here. Money. The tourists will come, and leave money. Why not? - He wants more money. - I see. Come, come. Yes. Ah, Masuria. Fresh air. Come, come. Lake, clean water, not like our tap water. - Come, come. - Thanks. Only German clothes. Do you want Armani to come to buy your land? - What's this? - Briefs. - Why so small? - To suntan your ass. - Grandpa! - Show it to me. A bracelet with a blood type. What's his? SS Rh positive. AB Rh positive. He's 56, she's 27. It's 30 years difference. - Is it a business relationship? - Definitely not. Who found Waniat the Drowned? A Japanese sightseeing group of 16? Why do you think all the disappearances are in my precinct? What? Dick, don't do this to me. What for? You should have stopped them. I know, free media, yes, but there are ways, right? Damn, Dick, I don't need TV right now. O.K., the same to you! Damn! He's sending a TV crew to me. Damned Dick. - Just name. - You bet. They're going to make a program about the Masurian triangle. Wait. The postman, let's say, got drunk, but the woman from social welfare? And the priest and the acolyte... It's a serious affair. She could stay for the weekend in the pension by the lake. The priest could be called to Vatican. With the acolyte? You can explain everything rationally if you want. The German consulate called. A German came to Masuria and disappeared too. But why here? Masuria is a big region. 14 districts, two communes. - Good morning. - You've taken the trouble. Duty. So you are the Makarewiczs, the new ones. Not so new actually. Where is the previous owner, Roman Ĺ - Gone. - Where to? Like the others - to America, for bread. Now people come back from America for bread. Have a look. Have you seen them? No. No. Pretty, but no. Haven't you seen this one either? This one - yes. Today I think. Your twin. I'm only checking if you look carefully. As much as my vision allows. Ask my son. Even if I know, I wouldn't notice. For me, everything looks alike from afar - a tree resembles a man, and a man - a tree. What's up? I'm the one to ask questions. - Aspirant Nowak. - Makarewicz. Why can't I ever meet you? I'm coming here for the third time. - We're in the field. - Where? I didn't see you. Not my fault. Have you seen these people? This one was here last week and wanted to buy our land. - And? - He looked around, inquired and left. Good morning. Aspirant Waldemar Nowak. Ms. Makarewicz. - The woman from social welfare? - We're still waiting for her. Didn't you see the postman? He brought an official letter last week. - And? Went away? - Indeed. Well, it happens. We'll look for him with hounds tomorrow. What're these? These? Wooden fetters with caps. I can see it. But what for? To prevent goats from escaping. - Are they yours? - Four. The fifth's on the way. Congratulations. Call me if you see something suspicious. Strange things are happening here. Have a nice day. You should stay at home, father. - Why, am I a child? - But you attract attention somehow. Till it calms down with the police. - Did you go insane with these fetters? - Yeah, everything is my fault! I feel comfortable here, don't want to move. - Me too. - So do your best, dad. Facts, people, events. We are always where important things happen. Where history happens. Events small and big, changing the fate of the world, the country and the region. Today we're in the beautiful village of... Odlotowo in Masuria. Here the people inexplicably disappear. Our journalist instinct leads us to clues in the Masurian triangle mystery. Jurek! Where are you? Jurek? What's up? I thought you'd gone missing too. Where have you been? I've been filming a bird. Good morning. ElĹĽbieta Borowicz. Facts, people, events. Polish TV. We're doing a report on the mysterious disappearances. What do you know? Well, a little. Pay me, so I'll give you some information. And show you the surroundings for free. Nice shoes. What size? - 43. How did you lose your eye? - I didn't. It's deep inside. Pay me, I'll tell you about my eye and let you picture this. Have you seen that old man? We can take some shots of him. We're making a report, not a horror. I thought you want to raise suspense. He's a real person, not a talking head. I won't irritate them. Only they wanted to talk with us. Hi. Do you live here? What's your name? - Marysia. - Nice. Like my fiance. How many of you live here? Is there any toilet? Can you show me the way? We were at the vicarage and the police station. At the vicarage they didn't want to open the door. - No wonder. People are scared. - But of what? Of everything. There are lots of lunatics in the world. Not now. In front of the camera. Jurek! And I want the family to speak too. But they are mainly little children. So at least your wife and the man with... the eye. - Daddy. - Exactly. I'll call Jurek, you - your family. Jurek! Have you seen Jurek, the one with a camera? He went into the barn. Jurek! Help! Help! Be quiet, they're coming. What's up? Why am I tied and where's my acolyte? - In a safe place. - It's illegal! Don't yell or you'll scare my child. See! I told you. What? What do you want? What is he doing to me? He's bitten me! Help me! He's sucking my blood! People, don't sleep! We need to collect. We need to help them. Ms Agata, don't sleep. Please translate. Agata isn't sleeping. Agata is dead. What do you mean, dead... Polish vampires... No, Agata is alive. But unconscious, understand? - Listen to me! - What? We need to shout. Understand? Maybe someone will hear us. - Bus? - Us. Bus? Us? - Help! - Help! Yes, help! Help! - Help! - Help! - What? - Agata. Hilfe! Very well. But we need to cry on four. Or they won't hear us. Ready? Three, four. Help!!! Help! Help! Calm down, O. K? I said: three, four. - One more time. - Help! I didn't say three, four! Attention, now. Three four. Help! - Help! - Help!! Help!! Can't you count to four? Three, four. Dad, you have an example here, look. Even if I try hard, it's always wrong for BoĹĽena, always. - Will you help us? - I cant. I have to get rid of the postman quickly. Too much confusion. I told you not to touch the locals, dad. So now I am allowed to do nothing! You'd better drive the stake straight through my heart! - Dad, also mine. - Not now. - Why not? - Your blood is still green. - Green? - Immature. - When will it be mature? - You'll feel it yourself. - They're very poor. - Are you defending them? Trying to understand. Four little children, both unemployed. - No future. - You probably haven't seen my legs! Don't exaggerate, he's only a baby. Nice child! I'm lucky his teeth are not completely grown. I walked a lot. My bag weighs 20 kilos, and I hoofed it. Two knee operations, one dislocation, and now... I wonder if it will heal at all. - Drink. - What's this? - Vitamins. - Don't drink it. It may be poison. But diluted in spirit. Not bad... Carrying again. A crane would be handy. - Like a draw-well. - Don't dawdle, dad. - Hurry up! - Easy. There's no house on fire. But it'll be soon. You heard what the policeman said. They're going to look for him with hounds. So, on four. - Leave them, dad. - You said I can take shoes. Someone's who drives a car, not rides a bike. How will he come back home barefoot? - I didn't invite him. - Leave them, dad. Wake up, man. He's too bemused. Get up and pedal away from here. - What happened? - Give up drinking. - They've found the postman. - Where? - He was wandering by the lake. - See? - Who found him? - Some strangers. - Their car almost hit him. - Is he alive? Yes, but remembers nothing. He'd been drinking. Check what he knows when he gets sober. It's gonna be O.K. They all will be found. There was a call from Warsaw. The TV crew disappeared. See? They must be having fun in a spa. Don't you know show-business people? O.K., let's sum everything up. What do we know? Nothing. No traces, no connections. Only that everything happened over there. I'll visit and check the pensions and spas. Phone calls will be enough. - What's up? - Can you move your toes a little? - But why? - So I can hit a vein easier. I beg you, no! I'll tell nothing about anyone, anything! Please, please! I'll pay you! Dear beloved! We're in a deep misery. - You've woken up. Hungry? - Very hungry. But not as much as I am. - Are you worried? - Yes. Four children, the fifth on the way, and constantly hungry dad. Let's sell it and go away. There's the buyer in our basement. - It's risky. - So at least the land. - It lies fallow anyway. - Will it be better somewhere else? - I want to go to a city. - A city? - It's easier to hide. - But where? Olsztyn maybe? Or even better, Warsaw? I'm hungry. You've just been at that social welfare woman. But I ate nothing. She talks too much. Only my blood pressure rises. Didn't make use of the German? - You should make yourself understood first. - Use the interpreter. I tried the cameraman. But he was jelly-like. You shouldn't have scared him. His blood clotted. Don't teach your father-in-law how to feed. Thank you. God, what a relief. Children, dinner time! - What are you doing? - Mending a chair. Can be anything done with it? It's not that bad. You still have one left. For how long, I wonder. MichaĹ‚! Let's take him. We'll be despairing later. - Where have you been? - I'd rather not say. They'll find our bones in the swamps after some time. Who else is here? The TV crew from Warsaw have come to make a film about us. - Us? - About the situation. That you and me are missing. Now they are too. It's going to be O.K., you'll see. - But when? - It already is. We're together. Do you think that we can escape from here somehow? How? With a table on your back? That's not right. We're here, bad luck. But they should treat us well! - I can't even brush my teeth! - I want to go home! The old man is always hungry. My legs are all blue. - I'll ask them to kill me off. - What are we supposed to do? Wait. It must finish some time. Or accept our fate and live here. - Father! - Leave me out of this, please. My legs are all bitten by this devil's seed. We all have the same problem. But their Sferatu sucks out vitamins from me. I want to confess. I have to. - Hear him, father. - Be quiet. You said you can't give up in life. That you have to be strong. In life - yes, but not here, in such conditions. Jesus, only a disability pension after this. I had a dream about the priest. At a funeral. - Whose? - Yours. Have you checked the reports from yesterday? Yes. The priest was seen by four persons. But in different places at the same time. - This woman has come. - What woman? Deaf and dumb. She saw the priest, supposedly. - Where? - I don't know. She's deaf and dumb. Yes? What did you see? Read my lips. Did-you-see-the-priest? Stone deaf. We need an interpreter. She's not the one. That's the one. I'm listening. Go on. - I'm looking for a husband. - When did he disappear? He didn't. I'm looking for a husband in the Internet. Mr Waldek lets me surf sometimes. Outside office hours, of course. - Grandpa, smile. - I'll show you! - Show me your eye. It's a movie... - I'll teach you! Leave it! It's not a toy. Leave grandpa alone. He's ill. Out! I've got good news for you, dad. I'd also like to confess. I want to be ready, just in case. You can't give up. Have hope. - Well, you said before... - Everyone has his moments of despair. Remember the story of St. Ignatius? His faith and hope. He was caught by robbers, imprisoned in a dungeon, fed with water and dry bread, burnt with fire, but he kept persuading them with holy words to correct. Right. Let's convert them! I don't know. Dad, you stepped on my toe. You are so slow. I should go first. Move away, dad. Help me with the needle. - Father, look after Kuba. - Me again? But he wants to be only with you. He cries with anyone else. Try with a film maker. Man! They're draining blood out of me with a hose! Feeling better, father? - I prefer to drink directly. - You have no teeth. And between toes... - Is he ill again? - He wants to go to the priest. He doesn't cry only with him. Take him to the attic, he'll be closer. You know how it is. The others will want to be moved too. He'll cry, and then stop. We need to release the priest for the Assumption of Mary celebration. - I don't know how the baby will react. - Let him go, then catch him again. Or put a cassock on the German, maybe he won't recognize him. He's accustomed to his blood, not to a cassock. I know the people are poor. I can see it in the villages. The poverty reaches everyone, nobody is spared. Some steal, some drink of their helplessness. Everyone fends for himself. But that's not the way. Prayer - the hope is in it! But not with a sin in your heart. With the innocent people in the basement. It's not right. Examine your conscience. - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! What about me? Thanks. Am I free, really? In a way. But first go to the attic, to Kuba. I have liver problems; your son can get stains. I beg you. Why me? The German gives him colic, the welfare woman the runs. He cries at the sight of the film makers. But after you he's rosy-cheeked, sleeps well, and poos are regular. I wonder if I should keep you permanently. - Permanently? - If it's necessary. We need to talk to Kuba. How come? This monster doesn't speak yet. So we have to wait till he starts. MichaĹ‚! I'll be right back. Please, stop! See the doctor instead running in black at night! I shouldn't have taken Satan in my arms. Don't complain. You got some exercise. Thanks, MichaĹ‚. - Throats are O.K. - Children, come here. Well-nourished. Vegetables, dairy, fruit, right? - Yes, more or less. - Very well. The bone system are forming at this age. - Very imposing teeth. - Can you examine my father, too? He needs a prosthetician, not a physician. A prosthetician? You need a dental plate. How do you eat? - Mainly fluids. - I'm not surprised. - Do you know any prosthetician? - I do. Very good one and not expensive. My brother. You'll get a discount if you use my name. And the baby should bite as much as he can. He does. All the time. Apparently not enough. He should more. His teeth are growing very fast and hurting his gums. When he bites, the teeth grow slower and everything will get back to normal. Good bye. - Good morning. - Not for everyone. What happened? - I've come to see your husband. - He's sleeping. Wake him up. It's a serious matter. Official. - What happened? - Nothing. - But I can see. - I'm happy. I'll be having new teeth. - Yeah? How come? - Prosthetic, a dental plate! - But it's in Warsaw. - So? I'll get a discount. - And? - They kids are O.K. But the doctor said Kuba bites too little. Tell it to the priest. What about a dental plate? Dad needs it. It's a bargain, and reliable. - But in the city, in Warsaw. - It's fortunate. We'll move. - Because of a dental plate? - Why not? Over my dead body! Do you want me to finish like your dad, without teeth? I have no head for teeth now! - So where was I? - Are you asking me? Who else? You are the police! You don't remember what you did with the body. - What body? - The priest's. The priest's? You disappeared at the same time, right? They found you unconscious by the road, right? And you pretend you remember nothing, right? - Right. No. - Maybe you don't want to remember? Four-year penalty for false testimony... False? I said nothing... The same for refusal to depose. Think. I'm getting to remember, but I'm scared to talk. - Go on... - Some words: - He's healthy, not old and well-built. - Who? Me. Then they carried me away. Two of them. One had blue face probably of drinking spirit and a beard. And I was yelling... It's your face blue of drinking hootch. - Let's go. - Where to? - To look around. - It's better to forget everything. Or I'll have nightmares later. Who needs it? Me. I want to sleep calmly. Man, people disappear in my precinct. I always carry things through. Let's go. - Where are you going? - For a moment... Last time you left for a moment you were gone for 6 days. - We're going to reconnaissance. - To save our village. Don't you have your men? - Can you see anyone? - Who? Anyone. - No. - Exactly. They never are in. - They're sleeping. - In the daytime? Maybe they're sleeping after a party. Yeah. Let's go. Shoot if you see something suspicious. What? A slingshot? - So yell. - Isn't better to run away? - What are you afraid of? - You've got a gun, and me - only legs. - So take the gas. - You take it. The wind blows, it'll get into my eyes. I won't go without a weapon. - Do you know how to use it? - Sure. O.K. Go this way, I'll go that way. We'll meet on the other side. Don't shoot me. KamiĹ„ski? KamiĹ„ski? What's going on? Makarewicz? Makarewicz? Again? May my blood stuck in your throat, you Antichrist! Police, freeze! - Where's the rest of the body? - Behind. - Where? I can't see it. - Behind the wall. Jesus Christ! How did you get into the wall? Through the chimney, you moron. - Run for help. You won't defeat them alone. - Who? The priest was seen by the exit to the lake last night. - By whom? - By strangers. He was running across the road. Did they talk to him? When they slowed down, he shook his fists at them. - We need to hear them. - They didn't leave their contact details. - As usual. Does Nowak know? - He hasn't come back. His wife says he's at work. Did he say anything? Where did he go, with whom? No, nothing. Don't worry; you know what Waldek is like. Always alone, secret. - What about the postman? - What do you mean? Do you know where he is? Something must be wrong with you. He's been found. When he's back, tell him to stay here and don't move. - The postman? - Nowak. I've come to see my husband. I'm KamiĹ„ska, the postman's wife. He didn't take a spare undershirt or tights. Nowak drew him straight from his bed, as for deportation. Didn't let him finish his dinner. Here's a bit of gruel, sock with meat. Gruel. Where's your husband, missing again? Ask the one who took him. Acolyte! Why do you let this priest maltreat you? Out of respect. He's my spiritual leader. - How old are you? - 20. My birthday was yesterday. You should have told us. We'd have organized something. All the best, lots of happiness and health. - Health and freedom. - Thank you very much. First the priest in the wall, now you on the tables. It's beginning to piece together. Exactly. How is father Marek? I don't remember. I lost consciousness quickly. Does he hold on? Doing well? Something was wrong with his legs. They stuck out of the wall. Maybe because he has liver problems. Can't sit long, as his back hurts. Man, the legs were walking on the wall on their own. Delirium. I had it once. Has the postman come back? Did you feel bad out there? Come back? It's my first time. Have I been here before? Twice, as far as I know. Can't you remember? Before they release someone, they make him drink nasty stuff to forget everything. So, how many times did we make that film? Once, but not the last. An interesting topic. You'll want to come back here. No way! Everyone says so and comes back anyway. Nobody has a gift for the acolyte? I've got something in my pocket. Help me, young man, will you? Here. Give it to the acolyte for his birthday. Thanks. Oh, it's so nice. Put it into my surplice pocket. Where are you going? Give it to me! You, you... son of the Devil! There're lots of people in the city, we won't stand out. Better for children. Schools, museums, language classes... We've got the German and the interpreter, if only they wanted to learn! BoĹĽena is right. In Warsaw there're more opportunities. - Better dental care. - Don't interfere, father. - What? - Who's my dad? The one who's standing before you. True father. The acolyte said that I'm the Devil's son. - Don't believe just anybody. - Sit and start working, don't talk rubbish. Or the bunnies won't be ready for tomorrow. Can you help? Everyone comes in handy... The barn, we are in the ba... no... in the basement, oh f... Damn it! It's like in a labour camp. - Maybe they'll feed us better. - Don't think so. Why should they? So I'm not working! How about digging a channel-tunnel? - A pipe? - What pipe? - What pipe? - I'm asking - what pipe? - Iron. - An iron pipe? Iron? Ms Agata, why don't you translate? - What kind of pipe is this? - Iron. Iron. Polish-German understanding. For many centuries. Praised be Jesus Christ. Is something wrong? Wrong? I hate you. On hard planks, all alone. Why didn't you say so? I'd have put some hay. My feet are cold. I'll get a cold, then the baby and it'll be my fault. Oh, that's much better. Barber, barber, shave a pig How many hairs will make a wig? That's enough. Doesn't he have a family? It's 2 a.m. We have to keep them two, three days the most. Nobody will care. Or we'll have problems. Is it my fault that the baby got addicted? There was one policeman recently. On disappearances. And also showed pictures. And now he's disappeared. - Why don't you speak? - It's late. We'd like to go to bed. What are they doing here? It's almost 2 a.m. They are curious what's going on in the great world. Nothing. Trouble. - People are disappearing. - They always do. Miss and turn up instantly. The social welfare worker's been missing for three weeks. The priest - for two... - People say bad things... - About a lover? A lover? Family, three kids. People talk... No, not in this case. He's a decent priest. And the acolyte is missing too. So... it makes you think. Will every disappearance be assigned to your precinct now? I don't like it either. We're working a lot. You see, it's 2 a.m. and I'm not sleeping. Is he yours? Why? No resemblance? Well... a little, from the side. So you've seen no one. But when we do, we'll report it. Thanks for tea. Stay here. What happened? You scared us. I hit my finger. It's swollen. How hairy. Now children get adolescent quickly. I know. Chemistry. So... I'll be going. Sweet Jesus! Four legs. - What's this? - They are praying. They've buried someone. Dead? ...needed to free the body and the soul. - Let's pray... - St Peter, hear us! We're praying to you St Peter, give us the power! Clever! St Peter! Hallelujah! It's 3.40 a.m. Damn! This work is killing me. No! Too much noise. Go to Krzysiek. My boss. - Let he bring help. - O.K. I'll bring reinforcements. Which one is more alike to you? That one. So who's my dad? The one who feeds you! Don't worry. Your father doesn't look like me either. How do you know that he's your son? You can never be sure. But you can see it. - How? - Not in this shag. In the way he looks into your eyes. How he holds your hand. Can it be felt? When you were ill, he was sitting by your bed all week. The acolyte has escaped. How? Maybe the stocks were loose. Are you my dad or not? Have you any doubts? We're alike. We aren't. Everybody says I don't look like you. - Remember what I taught you? - What? Ah, that. You have thrust them till it hurts. So you see. We are the same blood. Do you think another dad could do this? Well... no. Probably not. So don't bother. I'll teach you something else soon. Look. He's running. People! Help! Save the priest! Save the priest... Where have you come from? I've been running away! It's gonna be all right. That's all for now. End of orders. Did we do something wrong? Well... crisis. I have to be flexible. I've got new activity. Pity. We've been doing so well recently. I'll always remember you well. Always reliable. Roman also was like you. So? Are we moving to the city? Maybe... I don't know. You don't know? Someone has to make the first move in this family. Krystyna... He almost killed me, asshole and broke the headlight. Test his blood. It's him who almost killed me! My bike is smashed up. Where have you been, man? - On patrol. - What patrol? - What? - A regular one... - A week long? I've already started to make your dummy. - A week? I went out this morning. - This morning, means on what date? On 14th, Ms Krystyna. 21st? Think a moment. Calm down. I was at home... then at the police station... at the postman... Then I can't remember. - But what happened next? - Wait, I begin to recollect. Some words. - He's healthy. Not so old. - How do you know? - They talked to me like that too. - Who? I don't know. There were two of them. One was... blue. - Blue? - Had blue face. Of spirit. And that I was crying. A hundred beers...
