Yilmaz, from our village. Mediha's brother Yilmaz? Don't mention that bitch's name. Yes, her brother. What's he doing here? He came back from the service. He's helping us out. We're trying to get him a decent job. His parents moved to Istanbul. What do they find in Istanbul, don't know. No jobs, no food. You must be hungry. Let's order you something - No, thanks. Cousin. Where did you burry her'? Forget it. That's enough. It's over. Just tell me and I'll visit her grave. - Where did you burry her'? We didn't want to take her home We buried her here. You know... graveyard of the orphans. Her grave is unmarked. They just gave a number, that's all. Where's the graveyard? First drink your tea. I'll send you there with Hasan Hasan, where's our tea? Fine. I'll go wash my face. Where's the bathroom? Just go by the kitchen, you'll see it in the yard. He came out in the nick of time. He's walking with his head high. And he's down to earth. There's nothing to be afraid of. You've grown up now. You're responsible of the honor of the family. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid! Can you paint the picture of happiness? But without being too convenient... Not a picture of a angel-faced mother nursing her ruddy-cheeked baby.

What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to go back to your village? Look me in the face when I'm talking to you. Where's your bastard pimp? I don't know. I didn't see him for three days. If you see him tell him to find me. Did You get it'! I got it. Honey. Did you miss me? Come on in. Wow, wow, wow. This is Azraf. He'll stay with you for a couple of hours. Look, this is Anna. You'll listen to her. Deal? He won't talk, obstinate boy. Zoran, what am I going to do? The boy can't stay with me. What do you mean? You'll take care of him. Do you have anything else to do? I'll call you and you'll take the kid where I'll tell you to. What then? Do I owe you an explanation? Huh? Huh? Where's my money? Where's my money? Are you stealing from me? That's all I've earned. I know that you're up to something. If I find out that you're stealing from me... ...I'll make you beg on the streets. Do you understand? Do you understand? I'm not stealing. That's all I've earned. - I've only earned that much. - Give me my money. Give him something to eat. Then wait for my call. Zoran. The commissar asked me about you. I said I don't know. - He's looking for you. - Let him. If you keep looking enough you'll find trouble. I'd like to inscribe 'fight' on a leaf So that it falls when autumn arrives I'd like to inscribe 'angel' on a cloud So that the cloud vanishes when it rains I'd like to inscribe 'hate' on snow So that it melts away when the sun rises And I'd like to inscribe 'friendship and love' into the hearts of all newborn babies So that they may grow with them and surround the whole world Izzet. Izzet, aren't you coming out yet? Breakfast is ready. Sit with us together just for once. Fine. Cut it out. Don't start while the kids are around. As if you care about them...

Good morning, Commissar Izzet. - Good morning, Bilal. How are you? - Fine, thanks. You were to sign the reports about the raid. I'll take care of it. There has been an incident in Balat. They brought in a Russian girl. One of Zoran's. - Take her to interrogation. I'll be there. - Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Didn't I tell you to go back to your village? Look me in the face when I'm talking to you. Where's your bastard pimp? I don't know. I didn't see him for three days. If you see him tell him to find me. Did You get it'! I got it. What'! I said I'll see what I can do. To hell with the teachers and their meetings. I don't know when. As soon as I'm done. What if we have guests? I'm working here. I'll see what I can do. I've got plenty to do! God give me patience. Commissar'? They found the guy Tank He's managing a parking lot. Tell one of the guys to take me there with a squad car. - My car is still at the mechanic. - Yes, sir. Wait here. I'll be right back. There we go. Get lost. Welcome, Commissar. Congratulations. You have a nice new place. Thank you, Commissar. I needed a change in my life. Don't stand there, sit. You have it good here it seems. Didn't you miss me? - But no Commissar... - Did you think I couldn't find you? - I was going to come by today. - Take out the money. I don't have that much with me. You were going to come by today, right? Were you going to come by for a cup of coffee, you ass? Commissar, I've had some trouble. I couldn't get the money. How dare you to play around with me? Commissar... ...I'll get the money as son as possible. You're going to pay the double amount, tomorrow. Commissar, please. How could I come up with so much money by tomorrow? I'll send a squad to your harbor. They might have a look around. They probably miss the seaside. Commissar... ...let me make an increase in 4 months. You should make an increase as well. It's not so cheap to escape. Commissar, please. I can't find so much money. Look at me. I'm not like those losers. If you don't bring the money tomorrow... ...I'll bar you in and get rid of the keys - Take it easy. - Thanks. Is Master Recap not around? He went to the mosque. How can I help? That's my car. Is it done? Yes. I just fixed it. Thanks. The master will come any minute Could you wait? I can't give it to you before he arrives. What's your name? - Ali. - Ali? Tell him that the Commissar is very grateful. He'll understand. That's for your work There's no need to. I just did my job. Do you have a girlfriend, Ali? It seems you have. You'll buy her something. Let us contribute to love, will you? Love's not to be found easy these days. Cherish it. New places you shall never find, you'll not find other seas. The city still shall follow you. You'll wander still in the same streets you'll roam in the same neighborhoods, in these same houses you'll tum gray. You'll always an"give at this same city Don't hope for somewhere else; Just as you've mined your life here, in this small comer of earth, you've wrecked it now the whole world through. Ali? I brought the money. Well done. - Sit. - Thanks. Come on. So you finally escape this country? Yes. The prices have increased. You'll have to pay for one more passenger. What do you mean 'increase'? You asked for this much, here it is. We have to leave tonight. It's not about us, Ali. It's like domino, once it starts to fall over, it just continues. I brought the money You gave your word What word, boy? Am I a banker? Do you think I ask for that money for pleasure? We're paying others as well. I can't find that much in one night. There's another ship in four months. You'll take that. I can't wait four months. Everything's setup. We don't have to talk any longer. Your short of it. I said I have to leave tonight. Everything's setup. Don't raise your voice, Ali. Or else you won't see better days. Don't accept anyone else. I'll find the money tonight. That's the attitude. Are you alright? What'! You look strange. Are you not happy that we're leaving? Of course I'm happy. I'm just a bit scared. You don't have to. I have to go. Just pack your suitcase. Wait for me at midnight at the place I told you. You said we'd go together. I have to go to some places. We'll meet there. I don't know how, how to tell you my sorrow A sorrow that's heart-scorching A sorrow you'd wish upon your enemy If I were to name it heartbreak... it is not If I were to call it daily struggle... it is not If you wanted to overcome this sorrow you could not - Good morning. - Good morning. Couldn't you sleep? I couldn't even get a wink of sleep. I slept a little but had nightmares again. Your nightmares will end, don't worry. - Off to work? - Yes. I'm so happy that your out of this business. There are some real men. Bravo. He said he'd take you away and so he does. Running away is no solution. Look at my guy. He says we'll marry. I know he's lying but... ...you need a pinch of hope in this filth. Hello? Who? Mediha? There's no Mediha here. Wrong number. Hold it, don't hang up. Hello? Yes? Cumali, is that you? Where are you now? Fine, I'll be there in one hour. Is that the one who was in jail? - Yes. - What does he want from you? He was released, today. Why are you so excited? What excitement? I'm just happy that he got out early. So be it. I'm out. I'll say goodbye to you tonight. I just made tea. Figen. I wouldn't trust him if I were you. He killed his sister after all. Ali is a very honest guy. Welcome. Thank you. I have good news for you. Come on in inside. I was going to dress up. Master Recap is a great man. He talked to his nephew. He's going to arrange a job for me. May God bless him. Once we're there the rest is easy. We might struggle for some time but... Then everything will tum out fine. And we'll marry in a couple of months. I made some tea. Welcome, Commissar. - Where's our girl? - She quit. - She quit? - She said she had enough. Why didn't you let me know, fool? She quit yesterday. I was going to tell you today. Open up! I know you're inside! Open the door! What'! Speak out. Open the door. So you quit? I did. Why don't I know about this? What would it matter if you knew? I would fix you another job. I don't want any help from you. You didn't use to talk like this. I saved you from the stations. You respected me then. You loved me. I thought you were a decent man. I can't stand it any longer, Figen. I can't stand it. It's like hell at home. I love you. How many times did I tell you this won't work out. I respected you as an elder. I called you brother. Let's run away. To the countryside. Somewhere green. We could have a house with sea-view. Then we'll buy a boat. I'll do fishing. In the evening you'll fry the fish I caught. We'll open up a bottle of raki. We'd be very happy... We'd be very happy... Go home. Go back to your family. Hello? I wanted to talk to Mediha. She's not there? She wrote this number in her letter. Hello? Hello? Mediha? Is that you? It's me, Cumali. I was released today. Another soda. Who's the kid? Nobody. Is he going to flee the country, too? I want more money then. No, it's just me. Did you bring the money? That's half of it. As we agreed... ...you'll pay double. Yes. Double. Come to the harbor at midnight with the rest of the money. Don't be late. We won't wait more than 10 minutes. If you're late, you'll miss us and you can forget the money. - Did you get it? - Yes. I won't be late. Good girl. Hello? Honey? I'm coming, finally. I'm coming, finally. I missed you both. We're going to be together again. I have to go. I'll be with you tomorrow. May God protect you. Where have you been? Do I have to chase you allover? Don't walk away from me, got it? Move. It's a total mess over there. They're fed up with tyranny and violence. They want to live like humans. You don't look well. Are you sick? No, I didn't sleep much. Who knows where you've been all night. Were you able to let go of that girl? Don't start. You can't keep following your dick. - Listen. - Bekir, don't start. Start with what? You're my friend, right? You're doing wrong. You are a commissar after all. You have a wife, kids. Forget about that love. Your career could end. I'm not a child. Keep your advice to yourself. Come to your senses. Listen, you're going to regret it. I've done lots of things I regret. Left, right. 1, 2. Left, right. 1, 2. Again. Quick. Good. Again. Again. Left. Quick. Come on. Fast. Fine. Continue. Hold it. Continue with Mehmet. Mehmet! I told you not to come back here. I know. I came to say goodbye. We had our goodbye. - Are you still mad at me? - Are you not? Could you forgive yourself? I made a mistake. It's only human. Are you leaving with that girl? Yes. Is she worth it all? If mom was alive she'd love her. Your mother... thank God she died and didn't see what a bum you've become. - I'm not a bum. - What are you? I'm your son! We could've been champion. That was your dream. I chose for the first time something for myself. You chose the wrong thing. Farewell. Continue! Continue! Mediha. I'm getting worse each day. Jail is bad. They respect me here, crimes of virtue are deemed important. But I'm restless. I saw sister Nazli many times in my dreams. I still hear her say "Brother, don't!" I still see her eyes. Whenever I close my eyes, she comes out of the darkness. She says, "Brother, what have I done to you?" I embrace her that moment but she moves further away. I know that she'll never forgive me. You asked in your letter if I was doing fine... ...I'm far from being fine. Dear Cumali. I wanted to write to you for a long time. Maybe it's better if I do it now Your closest friend Resat caused me to end like this. But they blamed me. I'm innocent. I know you'll believe me. I wanted to tell you this a long time. Now you know it too. I'm writing you my address and my number below. If you wish to see me one day I'd be happy to. You said that you were far from being fine. Life is worth living, Cumali, no matter what. Even for people like us. Welcome. Thank you. Welcome to you too. - Good that you're out. - Thanks. You haven't changed a bit. You too. I was surprised when she said you were not there. She doesn't know my real name It's better this way. They call me Figen here. Figen. Anyway... I'll still call you Mediha. I heard about the matter you mentioned in your letter. Abdo told me when he visited me. Them put the blame on you. When that incident happened I ran away. Or else they would've killed me. I went to Ankara, first. They tracked me down. I had heard that you were in jail in 'Istanbul. I don't know why but I ran away here. I saw Yilmaz at Abdo's coffeehouse. He looked strange. Does it have anything to do with you? Don't worry, they won't find me. I bought a ticket. I'm going back by bus at 5 pm. I don't feel like going back, though. What else could you do? Don't know. I can't stay there. I can't look them in the face. Nazli was just an ordinary human like me, Cumali. She loved you a lot. Don't blame yourself. You've suffered a lot. Some nights... ...it rained heavily on the jail, as if the sky was punctured. There was... ...a small window in our block. I looked out of there. Bright, loud, big lightnings hit the ground. Just like in our village. Nazli was very afraid of thunder. She's come to me instantly. She'd say... "Brother..." ...can I sleep next to you until the thunderstorm is over'? I'd open up the blanket and she's slip in next to me. She'd hug me, shaking with fear. I'd say "Stop it, girl. Don't be scared, I'm with you." At such nights I've cursed at myself the most. Nazli was afraid of thunder. But I wasn't by her side. I tried to commit suicide a couple of times. Each time I turned away. You said "Life is worth living no matter what." "Even for people like us." I believe you. It's sad being alone in jail. I was never alone, thanks to you. Thank you. I wanted to come badly but... ...I was scared they could see me. You're not only alone in jail. Sometimes you feel entrapped in the whole world. I should thank you. You listened to my troubles. Young man. Would you like to buy a rose to your beautiful sweetheart'! - Sister, we're not... - Those look nice. I'll take that. - How much? - 5 Lira, and that's for you. Thank you. Thank you. Don't miss the bus. Take care. You too. Yes, Ali? I'll be waiting at the harbor at midnight, as agreed. Fine. Ali? - How are you? - Fine, thanks. What's up? You said you quit. I quit. I work at a mechanic. That's no work for you. Never mind that, do you have a fight for me tonight? I've arranged everything. Boss was very pleased that you'd come. Good, but I have one condition. I have to get the money tonight, win or lose. - We'll take care of that. Tell your boss, it's just for tonight Are you going to go back to the garage? You belong with us. Not after tonight Hello? Take him where? I'm not late. I'll be there in one hour. I want the money cash. Fine. The recipient doesn't have much time. We have to fix this right now. Take a look where that bitch is. My baby. Dad! How's my little princess? You're late again. The meeting is over. But I kept my promise and I'm here. Mom said that you wouldn't show up. Your mother was wrong. She owes us an apology. Can we go to the amusement park? Not today. I have to go to many places. But we'll go tomorrow, promise. You always promise but don't keep them. This time it's for real. - Is my brother coming too? - Sure. We'll go all together. Great! Now go to the school bus. Sleep tight today. We're going to have fun tomorrow. Run, run. Sis! Welcome. Thank you, dear. Come on in. - Is anyone inside? - Mom won't be back a couple of hours. Dad will be home at night. Come on. Come in. It's been a while. I've missed you a lot. I've missed you too. - How's Yilmaz? - He's fine. He doesn't talk much since he's back from service. What about the creditors? Do they keep calling? No. They gave UP... Sister. Take this. Don't tell mom a word. You do this each time. Take it. Give some of it to Yilmaz. He's young. He might need it. Oh sis. I wish you wouldn't leave. If only you'd stay with us. - I'm leaving tonight. - 'Leaving'? - Where to? - There's some guy. He loves me like this. Where will you go? Who's this guy? - Could he cause you some harm? - He's a decent guy. I wish you'd know him. I came to say goodbye. Sister. Open up. - What if it's mom? - Never mind. I'll say goodbye to her too. - You know... - I said open the door. Where have you been? You kept me waiting for two hours. Housecleaning wears me out. I can't feel my knees. The smell of detergent is going to kill me one day. Plus, I have to cook dinner. Get me a glass of water. What are you doing in this house? Get lost. Mom... - Don't call me mom. Get lost this instant. - Mom, please. - Shut up! Didn't I tell you not to talk to her'? - Mom. - Don't call me mom! Get out of my house! I'm leaving tonight. Let me hug you a last time. Go to hell. I'm your child. Your child! I don't have a child like you! You brought shame on our family. Mom. Don't talk like that. I said shut up! Get lost! I'm innocent. I didn't sin. Even you didn't believe me. If I stayed they would've killed me. I wish you were dead. I wish you were dead! You would have had a grave then. I could've come and visit your grave. I could've wept at your grave. I could've cried "My baby, my daughter!" But you chose to become a whore. - I'm not a whore. - Shut up, whore! Out! Mom, please! Don't! - What have I done? - Get lost, don't come back! - Mom, don't. - You whore! 'Mom! - Let go! - Get lost! Move! - Mom! Mom! Don't call me mom! If you show up again... ...I swear I'll shoot you myself instead of Yilmaz. - Sister! - Get inside! Get inside! Move! I'll kill you if you see her again! Move! This is all I can do for you. Look. They'll help you. I'm going to flee the country. I can't take you along. I have a child too. I miss him. Go over there. Come on. Go over there. Come on. Go now. Go! Go there! - Hello? - You bitch. You'll regret the day you were born. Bring that boy here. - I can't. - I'll kill you! Bring the boy wherever you are I know what you feel. Your anger, your scorn... I used to blame everything, everybody because of what happened to me. I did wrong things, very wrong things. Just because I was mad. I'm tired. I'm tired of being mad. I'm going back home. Half of my money is there. You wait here. Got it? Cousin, where have you been? You sent away Hasan. We were worried that you got lost. Oh no. I just took some fresh air. The air in Istanbul is not so good. Everything in Istanbul is filthy. Anyway. When you're back in the village you'll get plenty of fresh air... and your lungs will be overjoyed Where's Yilmaz? Well... ...you're no stranger. You're family. It's not fit for us to hide something from you. Did something bad happen? He went off to shoot Mediha. We knew where she was living but... ...we waited for Yilmaz to come back from service He's going to clean his honor. Just like you. Just like you. Cousin, I've got some work to do. Have some food and tea. I'll be back. The folks at home were very happy when they heard you're out. I'll be right back to pick you up. Don't go anywhere. Ali. Come on Your tum. He's here! He's here! Get on board, lady. The person you have called cannot be reached at the moment. You can leave a message after the tone. Ali... Welcome. Do you know how much money you cost me today? - He was just a kid. - What's it to you?! Is he your child? What are you hiding from me? So you were stealing money from me? I'm going to kill you, bitch. I'm going to kill you. Where do you come from at this hour'? Izzet. Get out of my way. - Where are you going with that suitcase? - What's it to you? I've had enough of begging for your love like a child. Then don't. Is there someone else? There's someone else. Yes, there is. I love somebody else. - Forget me. - Who's this guy? That's none of your business! You're lying. I don't believe you. What kind of a man are you? Don't you have any pride at all? I don't want you! Wait. Wait. Stop! I'll shoot you! - Where are you going? - I know her. - Are you related? - I'm her... Stay back! Yilmaz! Don't! Don't believe what they told you. That won't make you more honorable. Go. Run away. Go home. Go! Are you conscious? Follow my hand with your eyes. Ali... I don't know how to tell you this. I'm tired of running. I can't run any longer. I'm in love with someone else. For a long time. I wish we had met somehow and somewhere else. Forgive me, Ali. Didn't I tell you that you'd have to pay double if the boy came along as well? - Only the boy will go. - What do you mean? I'm not going. The boy will go instead. I got my money, the rest is not my concern. Get in. Just a second. Someone will take him. Can you give him this letter'? We're in a hurry. Get in. I'll say good bye. Just a minute. Be quick. Oh brother, may you get well soon. Thanks. Did you get rest? I promised you. Be happy... Very happy... Where's your woman? We can't wait long. You won't have to. What do you mean? She won't come. Me neither. Do you take this for a game? I held my promise and didn't take anyone else. You can't get your money back. I don't want the money. Take the girl instead of me. - How come? - Take the girl instead of me. Do you want to go? Take the girl. You got the money. Anyway, I got my money. Get in. Thank you. You've been again late to the meeting. Stop grumbling. You'll wake up the kids. You promised you'd take the girl to the park. Yes. So what? She'll get frustrated again.
