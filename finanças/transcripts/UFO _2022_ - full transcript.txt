NETFLIX PRESENTS [FUNKY MUSIC PLAYING] - [MAN] Are you filming now? - [BOY] Yeah, I am. What up, everybody? My main Ese just got discharged from the military. He's back on the road now and ready to ride with Kartal Motor real soon. El Patron and Tike are here with us too. - Come on, say something. - Hello. This ride was lent to us by Koray from Tayfur Gıda. You're the man, bro. Thank you so much for all your help. And I made some adjustments to make the engine extra loud! I'm Gökhan, by the way. In case you didn't know. And that one's Kadir, there. - Say hi. - Fuck off, man. Why don't you want to be seen? You're the one who made our super sick bike! Gökhan, just focus on driving the fucking car. What's wrong, bro. I didn't say anything bad. I just gave you props, man. [CHUCKLES] - [TIKE] There he is. - [GÖKHAN] Who is it? Who is it? Is he coming in first? [TIKE] Hey! It's Ese! Look at Ese! [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE ROARING] [GÖKHAN] There he is! Look at him go! Check out that speed. Show the dial! - 130 kilometers per hour. - [HONKS HORN] Ese! You got this, bro! - You're the fucking king! - Watch out! [ENGINE ROARS] ["SIGARASI YALDIZLI" PLAYING ON STEREO] THE WORLD HAS NO REMORSE BE AWARE KNOCK YOURSELF OUT [MOTOR REVS] - [MUSIC STOPS] - [HORN HONKS] Well done, Tike. Good thing this was a test race. I won't be entering the championship. Yeah, Kadir built a great bike, but we're in debt. They'd love to shut us down. They've been trying to for years. If we're not champions, we're fucked. We'll be just fine, don't worry. When we post that video, everyone will want a race. [LAUGHS] Yusuf, come here and show me the rest of the video. - It's a pretty sweet video. - Oh, is that so? Let me see. And that one's Kadir there. - Say hi. - Fuck off, man. It stopped recording when you hit me in the head. I think you need another smack. Get over here, you little punk-ass! [ESE] What the hell you doing? We've been waiting for your discharge for two years, but that dumb kid couldn't shoot a five minute video. - How about we shoot it another time? - [CAR HORN HONKS] - What's up, man? What's wrong, dude? - [MAN 2] Let's go! Would it kill you to wait? Just clear the road, boys! We've been waiting here. - Come on! - [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYS ON HEADPHONES] [FAINTLY] Oh my God, man. Blocking the road. They learn this behavior from trashy TV, I'm sure of it. I'm sick of this trash. [FEMALE VOCALIST HUMMING] - Deniz, dear. - Huh? He's talking about you. He said "exam." The one you took. - [RADIO ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] - But you don't care. [SIGHS] LYRICS: Have you ever asked? What is all this competition for? If you never race, you'll never lose. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Hello? - [GIRL] We're free! It's over. I'll hang out with my parents for a bit and then party time! No, Beren. I don't think I wanna go. I'm really tired. I'm going home to sleep. - [GÖKHAN] Try not to jerk the bike. - [ESE] Easy. - Huh? "UFO" what? - [BEREN] Sorry? [HONKS HORN] - What the hell, man? - Clear the road right now, goddamnit! Stop honking. Get out and talk to us, dude. - The fuck's wrong with you? - Wrong with me? I've got a problem? - Don't get me started! - There's a girl sitting in there. - [MAN] Did I curse at you? - [BEREN] Is that your dad? Looks like some extraterrestrials are about to abduct Macit or something. - It's all right. - Don't get all worked up. - Just clear the road. Don't pull this. - Just go, man. - Come on, guys. Be cool, all right? - Okay. - [TIKE] It's all good. - [ESE] Come on. Don't go running your mouth, man. [MACIT] Dear God. What a bunch of punks. [SOFT ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS] I'm starving, man... Hello. We come in peace. [BEREN] What happened? [DENIZ] I think I just saved us from invasion. Whoo! [GÖKHAN] Ese. What are you looking at? [DENIZ WHOOPS] [HUMMING] He rented a house for that woman, you know. I think you need to stop thinking about that man, Mama. [MOTHER] All the years I put up with him, they were just a big waste. Well, things will improve when we move to İstanbul. It will all be over. You weren't nervous in the test, were you? [MELLOW BEAT PLAYS] He got you this again? Oh my God. He pays his family zero mind. - It's unbelievable. - [GUITAR STRUMS] Hello? Where have you been? For four days? Come on. I'll ask my brother. I'll find out where you were. Hey, don't even try that shit with me. I have a pretty good idea where you've been staying. Don't even get me started. [LOUD BANG] - Hello, Beren? You out yet? - [MOTHER] Are you coming? Okay, I'm gonna come too. [MOTHER] I'm asking if you're coming tonight? She took the university entrance exam today, you know? And you're not coming home tonight? You should've told me. I made plans. Yes, I did. I prepared something. Yeah, I think I know what you're doing... [CAR HORN HONKS] - [BEREN] Deniz! - [HORN CONTINUES] - [POP MUSIC PLAYS FAINTLY] - [EXHALES] ♪ Has no fear of God ♪ ♪ Has no shame ♪ ♪ Alas ♪ ♪ Tell that to my heart ♪ - [VOCALIZING] - That's the spirit! That's the spirit! - [LAUGHS] - Get in. Get in! Who are you saving this voice of yours for? Well, not everyone gets to hear it. It's for VIPs, you know. - So you mean you have stage fright. - [MOTOR STARTS] Yeah. Anyways. Where's this party? Mersin'de. Don't give me that look, if I told you, you wouldn't have come. Let's go. [ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHEERING] Have you found an apartment yet? We could take a trip to Istanbul. We've got the car. It's still not certain though. - Why? Did you mess up the test? - No. It's that I never know what's going to happen with my parents. Ah. [DENIZ] Wow. Looks like your friend's parents got him a bike. You mean my boyfriend's parents. Hello there. Nice to meet you. I've only ever seen photos of you so it's really great to finally meet you face to face. - I'm Deniz. - I'm Beren. Pleased to... Hey wait! You shouldn't touch it. - Don't want to damage it accidentally. - You're right. Look! He's over there dancing. - Deniz! - We're here! - Coming. - Whoo! [CROWD CHEERING] [BEREN] The party is fire. It's fabulous. What's up? How did it go? He's even quicker to ask than my mom. - "Wow, the girl I love called me 'Mom.'" -Beren! Today I'm untouchable. I got my bike here. Ooh. We'd take a ride if you weren't scared. [DENIZ] What bike are you talking about? - I didn't see any bike. - I didn't either. - How come you didn't? - Somewhere I can put this? [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] Fuck, this is like the worst bike ever. How come you disappeared? Huh? I couldn't catch up with you. It's not about the bike, bro, it's the rider. He told you, this bike is not for casual rides. This bike's not for casual rides. I know. Nobody looks at me when I ride that one. This one really turns heads, with the dope lights and everything. Ese, come on. - Gökhan. - Huh? When I asked you what happened, you straight up ignored me. The whole country is partying down there. I brought you to this awesome thing and you're still busting my balls. What the hell, man? I seriously just found myself on this bike here, Ese. [LAUGHS] What are you doing? - This isn't fun, you guys. - [YELLING HAPPILY] - [SPITTING] - Stop it. Who are those guys? See them up there? Whoo! Yo! This is so dope. Party's about to pop off, man. Ese, I've gotta go take care of something. I'll hit you later, bro. Have fun. Mafioso bro! - I've been waiting for you. - Hey, what up, man? What the fuck? Look, this stuff's good. You know I'm good. Next time. [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES] That was you sitting in that car, right? Earlier this morning? Sorry about that. I'm Ese. How's it going? - That's a cool one. - Hmm? Your tattoo, it's nice. The UFO thing. I guess you're into UFOs then? Thanks. I'm thinking of getting a new one. Who's your artist? - What are you gonna get? - Tell me your name, I'll get that. [DENIZ LAUGHS] - "Idiot." - No way. You're gonna tattoo that? I guess I have to now. But tell me your real name first. - Yeah? But what's in it for me? - Huh. What's in it for you? It's good publicity. - I'll be like a billboard. - Billboard? Yeah. Publicity is good. This place is so lame. You wanna go over to this hotel downtown? Ali called, he says it's super lit. You'll like it. Cenk, why don't you go do your own thing. Okay? I'm fine. Daddy's worn out. I'm too good for all of this. I'm getting into law school, I'm not kidding. "Daddy's worn out." Yours is a private school. Money talks, baby. My family's produced lawyers ever since law was invented. - The legal calling is in our blood. - You'd let him represent you? Of course he would. We take on a lot of their cases, Deniz. Dear Deniz. [CROWD WHOOPING] That'd look great right here, "Dear Deniz." What will you be? - [DENIZ] Guess. - She'll be a princess. - Or an engineer? - Cenk! [UPBEAT ELECTRONIC DANCE SONG PLAYS] [CROWD CHEERS] [GÖKHAN] Whoo! Ese! This shit is so lit. Look around! It's like electric, dude! Huh? Canbay is actually my cousin. Ladies. We're from Adana, my bro and me. - Us too. - Oh, what a coincidence. You heard a popular rapper and you just made that up now, right? If Rihanna played, he'd say she was his aunt. Cut the crap. You seem a little tense. I can get you drinks, okay - Everyone's drinking what they brought. - Oh, you don't say? Okay, you got your drinks, you're set now. Go on. Have fun. - Does everyone bring their own friends? - Uh-huh. - [CHUCKLES] - Guys. Is everything alright? - Everything's fine. Just hanging out. - We're having fun. [GÖKHAN] Yeah. - That was you? - No problem, we're gonna head out. Why? The blonde is right. - We were having fun, right? - Come on. - Were they seriously bothering you? - We're heading to this party downtown. - Are you coming with us? - Yes, I think we are. This place is pissing me off. [CENK] All right. It got lame. So lame. What's he saying? [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GÖKHAN] Hey? Where exactly is this party? Which hotel is it? 'Cause my friend and I want to come. [PEOPLE SINGING ALONG] [UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING] [BEREN] Whoo! [ENGINES ROARING] What are they doing? [WHOOPING] [LAUGHS] Whoo! Whoa! Are you guys like showmen or something? Yeah, that's right, we're bike showmen. I see you girls got your phones out! "Kartal Motor." Tag us when you post the video, okay? What? - Tag as "Kartal Motor" when you post it. - What? Oh my God. Kartal Motor! Ah! - What is that? - Are you okay? [PHONE RINGS] They're calling me. Hello? Hello? I said, post the video and tag "Kartal Motor," hear me? What'd he say? - Kartal Motor? - Yes. [BEREN] What's this? You guys, it's a checkpoint. - Stay calm. - [BEREN] What are they doing? Man, I just drank one glass, damn it! [ON PHONE] And I just got my driver's license last week. What luck. - No, I can't do it. - [DENIZ] Seriously, you need to stop. Pull over for inspection. - It's okay. You only had one drink. - I did drink though! - I'm driving through! - Stop the car! [SIRENS WAILING] The police are coming! Beren, the police are coming after us! Oh, Cenk's gone! I seriously can't believe he did that! - All right, that way! - [POLICE SIRENS WAILING] - What now? - Hello? There's a left turn up ahead. Don't miss that turn. Okay? - [BEREN] Where do we turn? - Just turn here. He said there's a turn ahead here. Right here! Make a turn here! [SIREN CONTINUES] - Beren, you have to turn here! - Turn here! Left! Turn left! [SIREN FADES IN DISTANCE] Derya... - Hmm. - You must've fallen asleep. Get up. [CELL PHONE RINGING] [CLUCKING] Rasim, come on! [CLUCKING] Rasim, you got this! - [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE RUMBLING] - Here. Here. - [ENGINE SHUTS OFF] - Here. Park it here. Hurry, hurry. Good. - [MEN YELLING] - Go... [TIKE] What are you doing? I forgot there was a fight tonight. Good thing Tike didn't see us. - It's covered in dust. - Get me a rag, come on. - Here you go. - Take that. Wow. Holy shit, dude. I thought the police were gonna take the bike from us. Kadir would bash my head against the wall. I see you got a burner phone. What's going on? No races, no income for months, bro. Hey. You've been gone, dude. - I can't make a living selling spark plugs. - I've been in the military. - Don't act like you don't know. - I'm not acting like I don't know. You were in the military so all of us could sleep safely at night. Now you'll win the championship, get us publicity, and I can make money at the shop. [MOCKING] Please, Ese, save me from this life of crime! ♪ In the middle of the night The road is ours ♪ ♪ Racing at Çatalan We'll win, we'll win ♪ - Come on, just clean it. - Okay, man. - [TIKE GROANS] - [MAN] Come on, buddy! You got him. - Hey, Gökhan? - Yeah? Your customers are going to be calling those girls. Yes. - Don't look at me, call her! - All right, calm down. - Call her, man. Come on. - Dude, I'm calling her now. Good God, bro! What the hell? The way you're acting is bad for your blood pressure. You'll die young. - Look how I saved my name. Right there. - What is it? "Hot Guy." Why not? Trust me. Calm down, man. - What are you smoking? - Your hair will turn white if... Hello? Hey, it's me, Gökhan, baby. How should I get the phone back? Did you ask permission before throwing it in my car? It's your girl. Stop fucking around, man. On speaker. Hello? It's Ese. Drop me a pin and we'll pick it up. Sound good? [SIGHS] I'm just not sure I want you to come over right now. She won't give her address? We just saved... - [ESE] Shut up, man. Shut the fuck up. - [GÖKHAN MUMBLING] Cool. You pick the place then. How about we can meet somewhere in the Ziyapaşa neighborhood? I know it well. - My friend will meet you. - Your friend. That's great. - Okay. Great. - That's great. Awesome. [HANGS UP] - In Ziyapaşa, tomorrow afternoon. - I'm busy. Pick another time. All right then, bro. You call her. [GÖKHAN] She's not gonna listen to me. Your girl is really aggressive and she always interrupts me. [ESE] You shouldn't have thrown the phone then. - Careful, careful. - [CHICKENS CLUCKING] - [TIKE YELLS] - [ESE] He must be losing, huh? [BOTH LAUGH] [ESE GRUNTS] One, two, three. Man, Ziyapaşa is your kind of vibe. It's not really my scene. You should go. [MEN YELLING INDISTINCTLY] Okay. Not even CSI could find it here. [KADIR] You rode it and he crashed. This bike isn't made for casual rides. - Bravo, bravo. - Did you ride it on sand, dude? He rode it afterwards, though. Nothing went wrong, right? Ah! Well done, Gökhan. He's saying he rode it. - You just shut up, man! - What's wrong? The place looks like a champion's league arena. - Everything's covered in shit! - Think I'm booking fights just for fun? You think I enjoy hosting cocks fights? Do I look like I enjoy that? Next week the bank's gonna bust down our door. Holy shit! - What happened? - Yusuf, don't use that language! You're in a place of business. Yaşar's team posted a video, they did 140. No fucking way. Let me see it. Yeah. [TIKE] Really? Huh? You see! Look at that. - [MAN ON VIDEO] Hear me out! - He's lying. They don't have a repairman to build a bike like that. He said he was going to Antep. That must be why. The championship's just an Unidentified Forgotten Object now! - [TIKE] Turn it off. - Give me that list. I'm changing all the cylinders, guys. 65 didn't work. I'm trying 63.5. - Take this. - What are you doing, boss? - Rebuilding from scratch? - Yeah. Ese, do we rebuild? But if we lose the championship, all this work and money's going down the drain. Nothing's going down the drain. The champion's in town, in case you forgot. Yeah, that's right. - Who can ride faster than my brother? - Yeah. Hey, know what? Let's host an open race just for practice. All right, good. El Patron. Let's take some rookie's money, huh? Tike, let's do it. Yeah. Let's do it. Gökhan, here's the mortgage money. Tell them the rest will come next week. Put that goddamn fast-talking mouth of yours to work. - Kadir, let's get the other stuff done. - [LAUGHS] [MAN ON VIDEO] The score? 140! What can the opponents do? Follow us from behind. - He did really good. - [GÖKHAN] Is that so? [WHISTLING] [GÖKHAN CHUCKLES] - She's gonna like you. Don't worry. - Fuck off. Look at this guy. [SNIFFS] He's smelling his pits. I love it! [ESE] Asshole. - [GÖKHAN] Hey! - What is it? Make sure you get that video, the other one's no good. For an open race, we gotta publicize it. What's her name? Melis or something? Deniz. You sneaky bastard. [DENIZ] I'm getting myself in trouble for nothing. The guy hasn't shown up. Which one is meeting you again? The short, eccentric one? Beren! You sound just like Cenk when you say "eccentric"? Let Meriç do this. Why do you need to bother with him? That's a good idea. [SOFT MELODY PLAYS] Beren. What's wrong? The other guy came. Why do you sound all panicked now? - What's up? - How's it going? Um... So, by the way, thanks a lot for helping us get away. And tell your friend thanks. [BEREN] Too much tolerance costs you money, too much of a conscience costs you life. - Take your time. Calm down. - [BLOWS] Geez, it's right here. [CHUCKLES] - Can I ask you something? - Hmm? At that party, did you really not remember me from earlier? ["BIKINISINDE ASTRONOMI" BY SON FECI BISIKLET PLAYING] But why does it matter? Whoa. I'm headed this way too. I did remember. I see that you've taken every last precaution. Picked a crowded, public place to meet. Your friend's there in your ear. I can see what you're doing there. Oh, I see. What should I have done? Invited you over? Hey, guys. - Didn't think you'd stop. - Oh, for God's sake. [PANTING] I thought you might want some. And I'll be turning up there anyway. It's good, by the way. Thanks. You're welcome. Well, um, I should go. - [ESE] Oh? - Hmm? Okay. - See you around. - See you. - Hey. Deniz. - Huh? Who's your tattoo artist? - Hmm... - Don't worry, I'm not gonna get your name. [ESE CHUCKLES] Do you know what you're going to get? Gonna get "UFO" like it says on your bike? [DENIZ] Hey! I knew you remembered. I said it didn't matter, not that I didn't remember. - Move it. - It didn't matter? - You want to? - Well... - I'm gonna beat you. - Okay. I'm gonna beat you! She's overtaking me! Slow down. - That's your best? [LAUGHS] - Hey! Let me ask you... Why is it "UFO"? - Huh? - Why is it "UFO"? The bike. Why is it UFO? Because it's fast, it's a fast bike. It's got those lights and everything. It can carry you away. So it's a little bit like your tattoo. You know what I mean? Really. Ah. Got it. I'm also kind of into aliens. For real. [DENIZ LAUGHS] Uh, I'm gonna go this way. - [ESE] Oh? - You? I'm up there. Cool. Well, okay then. I had a good time. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Oh, shit. I forgot. Deniz. - Deniz. - Oh, what? - Are you also heading this way? - No, I'm not. The video you took of us, can you send it over? - Oh, so you're trying to get my number? - If I did, I'd ask you. I just wanted to post that video. You can post it yourself if you like. Hashtag Kartal Motor when you post it. It's actually important. You'll remember, right? - And why is it called Kartal? - It's actually a cool story. Gökhan's bike has this eagle painted on it and... [ESE] I wanted to follow her and finish the story. But what would I say after that? I'd run out. - We talked tattoos. - Uh-huh. Ate bici bici with her. It was great though, man. I just couldn't for the life of me think of something interesting to talk about, Gökhan. [GÖKHAN] Hm. I was super nervous, you know? I just... I thought she might misunderstand. You know what I mean? You should be more worried that she does understands you, know what I'm saying? [LAUGHS] I really can't tell you anything. What? I didn't say anything bad. You're getting carried away. You've talked for an hour and still haven't got to the subject. What subject, bro? What the hell happened to that video, Ese? Come on, you've been babbling on about tattoos and shit. Did you ask her for a tattoo? I thought I was doing your tattoo. You're really killing me. - Did you get my phone back at least? - Oh, yeah. I did. - Hey, Gökhan. - Hey, you, shut up! Here. - Ese. I think she stole my SIM card. - Let's check my pockets. - She gave them separately? - Yes, she did. - There you go. - I thought she stole it. Oh... Oh, no, it's broken, Gökhan. Man, what the hell you do? Next time, I'll snap your head, not the card. Got it? Keep getting into this shit, I'll fuck you up real bad. - Okay, man. I'm going home now. - Come with me. We're having a cookout. - A cookout? - Yeah, you like that. I do. [ESE] Dumbass. You get how I'm intimidated, right, Gökhan? What's up, Tülay? We're here. Hey, look who's come home. - Ah, do my eyes deceive me? - Thank you. Do you need anything, Seray? You? No, hon, no one in this house needs a single thing from you. What are you upset about? Here. Why don't you take that plate. Says she doesn't need any help, then makes me carry the plate. Seray already gave me shit, so please just give me a break. - Take these upstairs with the dealer. - Hey, come on! What's the problem? If you called me an accountant, I wouldn't mind. If you're ashamed of your job, quit it. You little shit. [CHUCKLES] [WOMAN] Ese, call Tike and tell him to get some yoghurt. - Yeah, will do. - What's wrong, boy? Huh? Is business better, now that the schools are on break? I swear this house is like a fucking narcotics bureau. [PLAYING FOLK SONG] Cheers, man. Good. Here, let me get those. - [TÜLAY] Help me with these. - I can do that. My God, 'm pleading with you. I'm begging you. It's night time and I'm sweating! Yeah. I'm totally drenched in sweat. Ese, bring that other fan over. If it's this hot now, imagine the wedding. - We'll be on fire. - [SHUSHING] Hey! The wedding is seriously all you ever talk about. Tell me about this new race. What's going on. If worst comes to the worst, we'll use your wedding money and hope for the best. [SINGING] - She's doing it on purpose. - Doing what on purpose? I don't have any money. - Stop it. You're giving me a headache. - [STOPS PLAYING] Calm down! Calm down. We're gonna win our race, and you'll have the wedding. All is good. There you go! See how easy it is? Everyone come sit down. We've got a race, Melahat! I'll make stuffed meatballs and other snacks, we'll divide them up. Okay then... Cheers. [LAUGHING] Lucky you. You're in luck. Tülay, bring us the numbers. Let's check. Okay. Hang on. Tike? I saw Yaşar's team's bike. It's all bodywork. There's nothing special with the mechanics. They've tightened the handlebar bearings so much, it sticks. It can do 140 on a flat at its fastest. - Is that right? - Yeah. What's the rider like? Like a pickle barrel riding a bike. As useless as that. [ALL LAUGH] Just take it seriously 'cause this year we gotta win. And, I mean, we gotta win big. Gökhan, go and post it online. We need six teams though, tickets and bets will barely cover. - Pass me those onions. - Mm. That's why the video is important. Man, I said she's gonna post it. Trust me. I trust you but I don't trust the girl. - [WOMEN] Girl? - What girl? [TÜLAY] Why didn't we know that? Why didn't you tell us? [WOMAN CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY] What's her name? Melis or something? Deniz. Deniz. Yeah. We put on kind of a show the other night. - On the UFO, right? - Well, one of my customers... They posted it to another friends' group. Let me show her to you. [TÜLAY] Let's see. - [GÖKHAN] See. Right there. - Which one? - Oh! - She's beautiful. - [WOMAN] Rich? - [GÖKHAN] More than rich. She's like next level. You know that sunflower seed factory? - [WOMEN] Yeah? - She's the owner's kid. [WOMEN] Ooh. [TIKE] Oh, hell yeah. [TÜLAY] She's not your average girl-next-door. Look. I found her Insta. Is that her? - [ESE] I can't tell with the sunglasses. - It's her. Send a request. Do it. Don't be stupid. She'll post it if she likes him. You should play hard to get. You say it went well, just send it to her. Or you can just admit, "Bro, I lied, it didn't go that well," and that's also fine. I'm telling you, she'll remember. She didn't remember me from earlier, but she'll... She'll post it. I know she will. - Look at him, he's all red. - [WOMEN LAUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] [ALL CHEERS-ING] - [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] - [HUMMING] NOTIFICATIONS 1 NEW MESSAGE 1 NEW REELS VIDEO [ENGINE REVS] My bike rules, bro. Cenk took off when he saw the police. Poof! He's gone. Objection, Your Honor! The prosecution is making this up. I thought you were coming, but you couldn't make the turn. I don't want to rant about women drivers, but... I actually have proof. I took a video. Watch and then decide. - Here it is. - [BEREN] Here you go. [DENIZ] The police are coming after us! [BEREN LAUGHS] - You took off! - How'd you get this video? - The prosecution's submitted the evidence. - Delete it. If it weren't for those two guys, we'd have been fucked. Right? I guess it's some weird subculture but you shouldn't affiliate with those types. They're all criminals. Organized criminals. [FAINTLY] You can ask my dad. Fundamentally, they're criminals, and... What's up with that long-lost video of ours, Ese? Huh? Did that girl even accept your friend request? Ese? Are you crying? I'll slap you, man. So the video and the girl are Unidentified Forgotten Objects now. Just bike around the neighborhood, shouting our name for publicity. [CLATTERING] - Goddamnit, what's wrong with me? - [YUSUF] Bro! Grab the dustpan and three jars and scoop these into them. No, not that! The video was just posted! - [ESE] The video's posted? - Yeah. It's super flashy and everything. That girl's quite the catch. - Told you. - I trusted you, just didn't trust her. - I told you, man. - Wait a minute. - She'd post it. - I'll cut my foot... [TIKE] Look at this. Don't do that, don't ever do it Nevzat got hurt doing that. Don't say that. Please don't say that. Stop, just a minute. I told you, I trusted you the whole time. The video's online. [TIKE] He looks just like me in my youth. That's my boy tearing up the highway. Pretty tight video, right? - That's the UFO, right? - Yeah, I told you. He rode it. - Take this thing away. Come on. - [YUSUF] Okay, boss. "Ahmet_03." "Ahmet." Ah! You sneaky bastard! "Ahmet_03," right? ["O BI' KARAMEL" BY OZBI PLAYING] [ENGINE ROARS ON PHONE] ESE: First of all, thanks to Ahmet. For uploading this great video. Ahmet_03: Need to support talented youngsters. ESE: Let me buy you something. What do you like? AHMET_03: Maybe we happen to meet. ESE: Where will you be? Let's meet. AHMET_03: I'll be in the coffee house. AHMET_03: It got some nice comments. ESE: You might think so too. AHMET_03: It's late, young man. Let's all go to sleep. ESE: Life is better than dreams now. I won't sleep. ESE: We couldn't get together AHMET_03: It wasn't meant to be. ESE: You have to seek it out. AHMET_03: I did. ESE: Where? AHMET_03: I sent a message out there. - Let's see who this lucky guy is! - Give it back. AHMET_03: Where are these races? [GÖKHAN] Hey, that's it! Invite her to the race. - If she comes, he'll win for sure. - Right. [CHIMES] "We're going to fuck all of you in the ass at the race for real." Come on! - Who's saying that? - Come on, man, just invite her. You didn't say that stupid shit, these losers did. Look at this. What does this look like? - Would you come if you were a chick? - Well, I... If I were a chick, I'd be out here breaking hearts. Know what I'm saying, man? - The whole neighborhood would be after me. - Yeah? Yeah. Would you be out here chasing me too? - [YUSUF] No! - Write this... - [YUSUF] What do I say? - Say, "We're gonna fuck you right back." - Hey, wait. Let me do it. - [LAUGHTER] - Here. - Watch this. [SCOFFS] [BEREN] Cenk will pay the bill. - [CENK] I got distracted. - Give it to me. [CAR HORN HONKS] [BEREN] Can anybody break a $20? I only have large bills. [CENK] I have $5 I can lend you. - Learn to ride, you dipshit! - I gave way, my man. Just go. Oh, how you doing? - Great. You? - I'm great too. - So you were in the area? - Yeah. I was. This voice was calling out to me and I followed. Was that you? Uh... are you hungry? [TURKISH ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Mehmet, can you not touch the sumac with your hands. I don't want onions with sumac. I'm going to hang a picture of you saying you're barred from here. [CHUCKLES] What? A girl isn't allowed to eat onions? - So you're single. - Huh? Huh? I said onions. - How did you jump to that conclusion? - Mehmet, um, make mine without sumac too. [LAUGHS] Thank you. - [ESE] Thanks. - Have a good night. [MEHMET] Thank you. [PEOPLE SINGING ALONG TO SONG] [INAUDIBLE] Okay. God, I was so hungry. If it's really that dangerous, then why do you still lie flat on the bike? I mean, it's crazy exciting, so I think it's worth it. You're doing like 150, 160 km/h. So, like, you're on it, like, flat. You're more aerodynamic. Look, you're flying. - Ah! - You see that? All right, I think I get it. Okay. Um... So, then is this your job? Kind of. I mean, I do make money from it. Like this upcoming race, for example. The winnings would pay off our debts at the repair shop. - But you know what really matters? - What? The race after that. If I become regional champion, - that's it. - [DENIZ LAUGHS] Done. All right then. Assuming you do became the regional champion, hope so, so what happens then? Where do you want your career to go after that? Well, what happens after that is I go do it all over again. That's what the champion does. For example, let's say the Beşiktaş team is champions this year, right? Okay. I wouldn't want them to step down after that. I'd want them back. It's like that. It's what the champion does. Then let's say you could have one wish granted, champion is really what you'd wish for? Yeah, yeah. But when you put it like that, like you'll make it come true for me. Like a genie. [ESE CHUCKLES] I'll do whatever I can. I promise. Ah. So then, if you're gonna grant me wishes, I'm supposed to get two more. - That's what I hear. - [GIGGLES] Three wishes, they say. [SNAPS] Well, you just used up a whole wish there. And now you only have two. [DENIZ] And don't wish for unlimited wishes. All right. So, then... what's your dream then? - To be a princess or...? - [DENIZ LAUGH] Sorry. Stupid joke. You said you'd try to guess, but then you didn't. Yeah, I didn't really know you really wanted me to. Yeah, well, try now. But let me try now. Let's see. Hmm... Something cool. Yeah? Like what? Yeah, like... a musician or something. - No way. [LAUGHS] - I'm right? No way in hell, Ese! - Hang on, I'm right? - [LAUGHS] - You're going to music school? - No, I'm not gonna do that. I wouldn't get in anyway. - Why? - People start training when they're four. And the auditions are held next August. I'm already 14 years behind. It's really impossible. And if you never run the race, you'll never lose. What does that mean? Who would say that? That's so dumb. - I say it in one of my songs. - Oh, so you have songs now? - Oh, no. [LAUGHS] - You're real-ass singer, I guess. - No! - Sing me a song. Come on. - Sing? What would I even sing? - You got it recorded? - Let's hear it. - No! I've been trying a few things out on my own, but I don't think it's working out anyway. Deniz, of course it will work out. I think you're gonna go to that audition. You said it's in August, so I know you looked it up. - I don't know, Ese. - Don't tell me you don't know. If you try not to go, I'm gonna come take you by the hand and take you over there myself. [LAUGHS] I don't know. We'll see. Oh, shit, the bike. [FOOTSTEPS POUNDING] [DENIZ] Are you tired? [ESE] Well, if we'd here by bike, we'd be a little less tired. I like that we walked slowly and talked to each other. [DENIZ] It was nice walking slowly. So, why the UFO? It doesn't have to have a meaning, of course. Do your tattoos mean something? Yeah, I guess. Well, they do, but it's all kind of sad since I got them after some bad stuff happened. My tattoo is kind of similar actually. [SIGHS] So, um, my parents didn't marry for love so they never got along. So whenever I'm home, they're constantly picking fights with each other. They were having a fight once when I was a little kid. And I tried to ignore it so I just looked up. - [SOFT MELODY PLAYING] - I saw this red and blue light in the sky. A real UFO! A real UFO? Oh, yeah. You'd never believe how incredibly beautiful it was. As a kid, I was so sick of the fighting, and I wanted to do was disappear. And I still believe that, one day, when everything gets to be too much, that UFO will come back and carry me away from all this. [CHUCKLES] How would they carry you away? [DENIZ LAUGHS] - I'll keep that to myself. - Ah. [DENIZ] That's my house. - Oh, that one? - Mm-hmm. [ESE] Hmm. Well, I told you, but you didn't tell me. Huh? About the meanings behind your tattoos. Oh, I'll tell you. [ESE] Uh... My dad. - I'll just go. - Hey, no. Just wait a sec, it'll be fine. It's all good. - Deniz? - Hey. Welcome home, Dad. This is my friend, Ese. Good evening, sir. [CLEARS THROAT] Nice to meet you. - I'll head out. - Ese. Can you wait for a bit? I'll be back in two minutes. [MACIT] She's hanging out with bikers. Why are you acting like such a snob? If it were Cenk, you wouldn't have a problem! Do you think that boy is a good match for you? He's respectful, cares about my opinion, If only all guys were like that. Okay, just drop it. We get together once in a blue moon. Let's just eat. Once in a blue moon? Really? Ah. Now I understand who's really been riling Deniz up. - What are you talking about? - Nobody is trying to rile me up. I think we all know what's really going on here, Father. I know you're riling her up. Bravo. Good for you, come on, go eat. [MACIT MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, Deniz, my God. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [DENIZ] Ese. I didn't even get his number yet.

Listen, Ese comes back from the military and we hit the clubs the first or second day he's back. And then... We go in and it was this club we used to go to all the time. The girls were like, "Ese, Ese!" [ESE] Hey, Ahmet. Sneaky girl. How you doing? Ese. [CHUCKLES] I see myself in this guy. I apologize.

If we knew Ese's sign, we'd check your compatibility. You don't? [CLICK TONGUES] - We found Ese on the street. - Really? He was about two. We found him in this neighborhood. We had recently lost our little brother, around the same age. May his soul rest in peace. [TÜLAY] Amen, amen, amen. What do you mean? You seriously don't know his parents? We asked around everywhere but couldn't find them. And we didn't want to put him in an orphanage. Why are you staring? She's shocked. Shh. Well, just a little. [TÜLAY] Oh my God.

I know you're scared of them. Have you ever ridden one? I assume you've been on the back of one. - Really? - [BEREN LAUGHS] - No? - [CLICKS TONGUE] - Let's go, then. - Let's go. But it's gotta be somewhere really worthwhile if I'm gonna go through all that. - Yeah, that can be arranged. - Good. Wow! Why is he sitting there? Is he guarding his bike? Get over here. Nobody will steal it. I'm fine. I'll be off in five minutes. You didn't even look for me. I saw that message. You having a famous cousin is not gonna do it for me. I'll pass.

Come on. - Let's go. Where did they find these lowlifes? They're all criminals. So the UFO ready for the race? Ready for blast off? - It's all set. - You thought it was that kind of UFO? We're not sci-fi nerds. It stands for something else. - "Unidentified Forgotten Object." - What's that? When you want something you can't have that thing is an Unidentified Forgotten Object for you. [LAUGHS] Deniz, the "UFO" is a put-down. - What? - [ESE] It's for the other rider. That's an Unidentified Forgotten Object. I guess it's a way to attract girls who are into UFOs. Huh? Whoa, man, this is a frigging awesome bike, dude. [CANBAY] All right, let's get the next guy on stage. [GÖKHAN] I'm gonna go next. What's up, guys! [CROWD CHEERS] This is super sick, dude.

Hey, riders. I've got the message that the road is clear at Çatalan. Let's go. [GÖKHAN] Come on, to Çatalan! Come on, let's move out! Come on, bro. Let's go. - Okay. - [ESE] See you later. - [HORN HONKS] - [ENGINES REV] Can we have a chat? Cenk, don't be ridiculous. Stop. You can talk to her later. As if it's an F1 race. We'll meet you at the finish. You go with Gökhan. [GÖKHAN] Hey, you. Why don't you join the race then? Huh? He's got a bike. It's an open race. - So pay up and join in. - Come on, man. Don't be dumb. You'll have no chance. Look at these bikes and look at mine. Well, then, let's do it. It's the rider that counts. Don't make me rob you of what little you have, man. - Don't do this. - If you can afford to lose money, not wanting to race is just you being a coward. I don't have cash on me. You ride a bike like that but you have no cash on you. This guy's full of shit. You and I, we don't even mean the same thing when we say "money." It's like we don't even speak the same language. But I can pay with a card. No credit cards. But we can take the bike. Consider it pawned. You'll get it back after the race. Cool? Cenk, come on. What are you gonna tell your dad if something goes wrong? [CENK] All right. All right. - Haydar! What's up? - Yes? Check this out, bro. Got a new rider. Load up that bike right over there. Careful, don't scratch it. Let's find out then. - Good. - [GÖKHAN] Come on. Come on. Deniz. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINES ROARING] [CROWD CHEERING] Take a good look while you can. - Move along. - You're a bad racer... or is your bike just broken?

I told him I was with you. What? Are you freaking crazy? Why would you give her name? He must have told my parents too. - I'm gonna go. - Stay here, I'll deal with him. - I said I refuse to go in there. - I can barely move this thing. You shush. If this were a private hospital, you wouldn't have to. [INDISTINCT PA ANNOUNCEMENT] [DENIZ] How is he doing? - Not so good. He suffered a head injury. - Are you serious? [YAŞAR] Gökhan! - Wait here. - You can't just leave. - Deniz. - [DENIZ] You can't just leave like that. Ese! Don't get involved! [MEN ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] [ESE] Hey, get your hands off him!

["UZAKTAN" BY SEDEF SEBÜKTEKIN PLAYING] Deniz! Derya, get her here. Get in here! [GÖKHAN] You think I'm happy with this? Let go of me! Just get out of here. It's not safe. This fucking guy thinks he can throw a hand and get away with it. [INDISTINCT ARGUING CONTINUES] [SONG CONTINUES] - [KADIR]Give me the lever. - [YUSUF] Here, boss. [TÜLAY] I really think something's up with these numbers. Eight plus nine... [TIKE] How is it? Anything to salvage? The shock absorber, the carburetor, the body, they're all dead, bro. As it stands, it'll cost us 14,000. The shop's already 6,000 in the red. Let's have the wedding collect some gold from there and sell it! Stop talking nonsense. The wedding night is all she thinks of! - What are you talking about? - Shut up. - I'm trying to help. - Don't make me slap you. Shh! You don't fight here, it's a place of business. No, you shut up. Listen... most of the shops are withdrawing from the race. People are saying we'd win if not for the accident. Yaşar's team was our only opponent. - They're bringing in a new CG. - He was whining about his expenses. Now that rich douchebag is seriously bringing in his new CG. This all happened because of you running your mouth and you're still talking? Why don't you shut up? Should we build a totally new bike or fix this one instead? - It won't be ready, we gotta rebuild. - Seriously? A custom build from scratch takes about three weeks, Ese. - Fuck that. - [KADIR] Gökhan. Place the order. We'll pay with our wedding funds. - And the rest, God knows. - And work with the shutters closed. - The bank might be coming by. - Kartal Motor is never gonna shut down! Since you're saying it's all my fault, look here. [GÖKHAN] I know things are tense so I won't make this a whole thing... I'll tell you straight up, congratulations, we're saved! Is that the rich bastard's bike? Yeah. They brought it on the truck. And Gökhan stashed it right away. We'll scrap it for parts right away and I'll sell them today. It'll pay all our debt. And that bastard will forget about it. We can't do that. I don't like the guy either, but we can't do it without asking him. He's not gonna let you steal his property. Huh? Don't be a smartass. I'm gonna bash this guy's face in. Yeah, but he's really stupid. He probably won't even know his bike is missing. This is all because of your pride! You're overreacting. I've had enough of your lame army morals. [CELLPHONE CHIMES] [SIGHS] Tell Cenk to come and get his bike. LOCATION By the way, it's Ese, your boyfriend. CENK: Okay. My arm's fine, by the way, thanks for asking. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] BERENIMO 1 VIDEO MESSAGE And the Oscar goes to Beren Aydoğdu! I got into the film program of my dreams! You? [CLICKS] [DERYA] Deniz!

I'll visit you on the weekends. [DERYA] We didn't say that. I just can't move, Derya. I have to handle our business here. You go and get settled. I'll come later. [GASPS SOFTLY] I think there's gotta be a mistake here. No. That's correct, Mom. I handed in a blank second exam. Istanbul wouldn't have saved us. You couldn't have either, Mom. - You know, it was up to me. - Do you really hate me that much? You just ruined your own future, Deniz. And you also ruined mine. We got her at the hospital yesterday. Maybe it'll be the police station tomorrow. You're going to Istanbul no matter what. You'll stay away from those degenerates. And you'll prepare once more for the exam. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] Go away, Macit. Go be wherever you'd rather be. What she's saying, think about it for a second. And then you can talk. All right. Mom. Hey. [CELL PHONE CHIMES] BEREN: What's up? Did you check? Come on, I'm curious. Deniz! - How is the eccentric bracket looking? - The eccentric is dead, bro. But the piston is good. That's 200 less. [HORN HONKS] - What the hell? - Hey, boss! Mehmet Güner? - That's me. - We got a tip, we have a search warrant. What's going on? What is it about? I mean, I'm asking so I can help you out. [COP] What are these? [TIKE] These belong to us. We collect for fun. Oh, fuck. - Police are here! - [ESE] Calm down. [ESE] I let them know about it. - God. Open, damn it! [GRUNTS] - [ESE] Chill out. - I had a stash! - [ESE] Put that shit in your pocket. - What's back there? - [TIKE] A storeroom. Not much. - [COP] We'll see whether there's anything. - Go ahead. - [ESE] Hello, officer. - Hello, guys. - Can I help you? - I would doubt it. Come here. Who owns this bike? Why are the police here? - What's going on? Is there a problem? - It's reported as stolen. There's no way it's stolen, sir. Not like I was born yesterday. Why would I keep a stolen bike in my shop? I'd scrap it for parts and sell them. - Is that so? - Of course. Pardon, Officer. Is there a problem here? Um, that bike belongs to a friend of mine. Cenk Adiloğlu. We did text him about it. He definitely knows it's here. - I'll call him? - [COP] No, we'll call him. - [ESE] Deniz. - Ese, what's going on? That punk-ass friend of yours didn't come to get his bike. I don't know, there must've been some kind of misunderstanding. They're calling him. Ese, the UFO is a total wreck. Are you going to be able to fix it? - Don't think so. - We will, if we find the money. Gökhan, can you please leave us alone. Go get some air. Yes, sir. Sure, chief. Let's take them into custody. All of these guys! - What are they doing? - Don't worry, we're used to it. What's that supposed to mean? - I still have things to do here. - Go! Come on! Cenk's bike was reported as stolen. The police came and they arrested them. They're in custody, but it's not an arrest. Calm down. Seray, go and change your clothes. Don't wear that top. Here, put these on. And you can call our lawyer, Cemil. Probably took them to the Yüzüncü Station. Tell him to hurry down. Okay. I'll tell him. The wedding won't be canceled, right? Enough with your stupid wedding. Be patient. We'll take care of it somehow. - Let's see... - [TÜLAY] I'm here. Hey, Yusuf, you're coming with us too. Do some of your crying, okay? Say we depend on the shop. Please, sir! I'm begging you! It's our livelihood. Not like a beggar. We'll practice on the way. Do we need a lawyer? Yes. This is not a barroom fight. There are big people involved. I can try and get the complaint retracted. With the complaint withdrawn, there'll still be a prosecution. Tell him to make a statement saying it wasn't stolen, he was medicated. - Let's go. - Come on. Make sure you bring that kid to the station. - [YUSUF] Please, sir! - Okay, shut up. I'll have to do it myself. What's this? Why didn't you clean your nail polish? [ALL CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY] All right, let's all welcome our new graduate. Welcome, Cenk! Thank you so very much. I worked harder than Cenk to pay for it. But he finally made it. Right? Good to see you, Deniz. - Thank you, ma'am. - Deniz? What is this, Cenk? It's my grandfather's. - So where were you accepted? - She'll become an engineer, right? I actually came here to steal Cenk away. Beren's here with me. We want you to come with us. We're hosting a little party for you. [CENK] Okay. - It looks good on me. Doesn't it? - It's great. - Hmm. - Mm-hmm. It still has my grandfather's smell on it. What the hell do you think you're doing here? What the hell do you think you're doing here? People are in the hospital, in police custody because of you. I sent you a message. I said your bike is in the shop. I know you read it. My father made me sign an incident report, was that processed? And now we're going to the station to fix it all. We're going to the station? What is this? Don't you worry. You'll be fine. - If you're afraid your dad will find out... - You said that then too. You said I was afraid. I'm not afraid of anybody, believe me. - How else am I supposed to prove... - You're not. Don't prove, Cenk! Don't even try. Just admit you're scared to death of your dad. Go tell them you signed what he gave you without even reading it. And that you're turning into another version of your dad just to protect yourself. You know what? You pretending to be brave is worse than being a coward. Oh, and if you feel the need to prove something? All right. Either we go upstairs and tell your father everything or we... [STIFLED SOBS] ["FIRTINA" BY EKIN BERIL PLAYING] How do you like it? You really freaked out? I mean, not really, but I'm guessing it's a lot more fun to ride it. Try it out before we sell it. It's easy. No, Ese, I can't do it. I'm having a good time already. - We haven't done the fun part. - What's that? - Hold on. - Ese. - Hold on tight. - Ese, don't try to scare me. [DENIZ] Whoo! [SONG CONTINUES] I've been really uneasy since the last race. I am too. But not because I'm afraid of getting hurt. Right now things are really good and I worry they won't last, know what I mean? [BIRD CHIRPS] I know I'm not making any sense. Sorry. No, but if you're still gonna do it, at least try not to court bad luck. - I'm not asking for UFOs, am I? - [CHUCKLES] - I think it's really great. - What? To be working towards what you really want. It matters. What about that singing audition? You're not giving up because you got in somewhere? I wasn't accepted anywhere, Ese. I actually handed in a blank exam. For the music audition? No. I did it so my family would stay here. - What's it got to do with music? - I don't know anything about it. But if you sing your own song in that audition, there's no way in hell they won't accept you. [LAUGHS] - Why are you laughing at that? - But I have to sing an aria to get in. - Aria what? - Mmm. What's that? Sing both things then, why not? Promise me you'll sing them both your songs. Ese, I don't know. - Deniz, promise. - I don't know about that. - Promise or I'll throw you in. - [LAUGHS] No! What do you mean? I can both sing and fall into the water. Well done! - Let me throw you in! - Why? - You jump in, and I'll sing. - All right. - [DENIZ LAUGHS] - [ESE] Oh! [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] - [ESE] You promised you'd audition. - [DENIZ LAUGHS] I just promised that to make you jump in. But seriously, if I go audition, the judges will be like, "Why are you here?" And they'll turn me down. Don't say that. If you had no talent, Canbay would've said so. He's so into it in the video. - Couldn't you tell? - I couldn't watch it. - What? - I didn't watch. - I can't stand watching myself sing. - Oh, so that's why. Listen, I'll show you the video now. If you hate it, don't audition. I won't make you, I promise. Hang on. Here watch it. Watch it. [SINGING ON PHONE] Look. The guy had a duet with you. He rejected the others but had a duet with you. [CHUCKLES] Huh? Listen to those high notes. [MUSIC STOPS] - All right. - What? All right, I'll apply. - And raise the stakes, we'll go by bike. - Oh. - And I'll do the driving. - Really? - All right. - Try it, then. Now, what am I supposed to do? Now look, first you put on your helmet. There you go. Like that. Yeah. Right there. Wait. That goes there. The stand. Kick it back there, press that. - Don't worry. - [ENGINE SPLUTTERS] Press it like that. - Press it a little harder. Good. - [MOTOR RUMBLES] [ESE] Slowly ease your hand off the clutch. Accelerate. - Easy... - Yeah. - Let it go and accelerate. - Okay. Got it? Don't be scared. That's good. Perfect. - [ENGINE REVS] - Easy, easy. That's good. You got it down. There you go. Nothing to fear. That's good. You're a natural. - [DENIZ] Ow. - Shit. Deniz! - [ESE] Are you okay? - I'm fine. [ESE] You don't know how to ride but you don't know that you know. [DENIZ] "You know but you don't know that you know." I just fell, you dumb-ass. See you later, baby. See you. This goes here. Okay. [SIGHS] Ese, I want to tell you something but... What is it? What Gökhan was saying the other day. That you're going to sell the bike. And how you get lost in your thoughts sometimes. - I saw how bad UFO looked that day. - We'll fix it. Let's fix it together. I can help you out. And I'll help pay for it all. Am I not also part of the team? I'm gonna go now. Your parents are here. You don't wanna get in trouble. - Ese. - See you later. [ENGINE RUMBLES] Back to square one. [SIGHS] [ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [MACIT] Something's changed with you. Like what? I'm not sure what it is, but I liked the old you. And I like myself better now. [SHUTS OFF TV] [MACIT] What's going on? Let's get divorced. It should be a relief for you, Macit. [MACIT] Where did that come from, Derya? Good God. I never agreed to any of this. - We haven't talked about it. - Is there anything left to talk about? The business? I'm talking about a divorce, and you're bringing up business? Have you talked to your brother? Like, how will you run things? How will you oversee the factory? We've been running the house without you for years. The factory will be just fine, don't worry about that. I'm perfectly capable of doing your job. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, Macit. Let's go. [MACIT SIGHS] [DOOR SLAMS] [CAR ENGINE STARTS] I'll get some air. How else were we supposed to get things back together? My ass, you'll handle it! God damn it, Tike! You practically lost everything you gambled with too. - I took a risk. - You took a risk! Well done. - Who did you play against? Nuri? - Against Metin. - What's up? - Nothing. - Hey. Where are we going? - To get the money. - [TIKE] It's gone. This is gambling. - [GÜLAY] Tell me about it! [CELL PHONE CHIMES] DENIZ: I didn't mean to upset you. [ESE] We're so fucked. It's always something. Fucking... [TÜLAY] Why are you talking to yourself? What is it? - She knows about the bike. - Who knows? Deniz. She's gonna try and give me the money. - Classic rich girl. - What the hell are you saying? Don't be such an idiot. She trying to help you. You don't have to accept it. But stop acting like it's beneath you. - I thought Gökhan called you over. - What's up with him? They beat our little drug dealer up. He just came. He's upstairs. - [LAUGHS] - What's so funny? I'm enjoying it. - [ESE] My God, seriously. - They should've beat his ass months ago. Yo. It wasn't the package, right? Fucking bastard. - You should see the other guy though. - Seriously, man. No. I just took my beating like a good boy. Don't want to mess around. [ESE EXHALES] I had my money and my stash on me. It's all gone. [SIGHS] Tike lost as well. Look at your face now. - Don't do this again. - What do you mean, man? Huh? What do we do? The wedding money is gone. Money from the drugs is gone too. Our debt to the bank is just growing. - You made me give back that kid's bike. - What now? - I have a plan. - Mm-hmm. You know, the part we ordered? It's at the part store. - No, man. - Hold on, listen to me, man. We've paid for half of it already. We'll pay the rest after the race. Once you've become the champion. Which you will be. [CELL PHONE RINGING] There's a guard. And the championship game is next week. I'm sure he'll watch. It's the night before the race. Are you listening to me? [RINGING STOPS] What? Deniz, man. She thinks I can't do it by myself. She wants to help with it. Financially. I really don't know. There are actual UFOs in her world. It's Unidentified Forgotten Object for you. She just doesn't understand. [SNIFFS] Yeah, looks bad. [LOUD BUZZ] I'm in complete shock now. Your mom's acting like an entirely new person, but that's not the issue. Why did you hand in a blank exam? She said she felt nervous and made me come with her. I've been decorating her office for the last week. You're not listening to me, Deniz. What will you do now? I'll be studying music, Beren. - Won't you say, "I told you so"? - Of course. I told you so. Wait a minute. Am I the only one who's happy to have gotten in a good school? What did everyone else do? Cenk, he just suddenly left. I don't know what got into him. He told his parents, "I'm not coming back, I won't be going to university." I was worried, so I called him. He says he's off to find out who he is, discover his inner self or something. - I don't understand. - Maybe it'll be good for him. I'm gonna call him sometime. Hey, are you okay? Ese and you are all good, right? 'Cause you're not going away now. Maybe it's because of that. Because I'm not going. He thought I'd be leaving. So now that I'm not... We're off. He still hasn't called. We haven't even met for a while. I guess we're gonna meet up later. It's the night before my audition after all. Don't you follow Gökhan on the socials? What's this? GROWING UP ISN'T EASY! Go stop by. [EXHALES] [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] WE WISH SUCCESS TO DEMİRSPOR THE PRIDE OF OUR CITY [HORNS HONKING] [CHANTING] Champion! Champion! [GÖKHAN] See, the plan is running like clockwork. [CROWD YELLING] Ese! Ese! [HORNS HONKING] [DENIZ] Ese! [POLICE SIRENS CHIRPING] [HORNS HONKING] I swear, I'd play better with this big old belly of mine. How can you hit the ball like that? Can't fucking believe this. God, they make me so mad! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Stop here. Come on. - Take this one. - Here. How long we got? - About 20 minutes. - 20 minutes. - Come with me. - Gökhan. There's an entrance at the back. Follow me up here. DENİZ INCOMING CALL - Hey, how you doing? - Hey, man. Good to see you. - Thanks. How is the game going? - We scored in the 18th minute. Bastards are going nuts. [LOUD CLATTER] Hey! I'm calling from Şakir Şahin's auto parts store. I'm the night guard. Someone has got into the store. The guard called the police. He went inside. Good night. Oh, shit. [LOUD BANG] [CLATTERING] HALF OF IT HAS BEEN PAID - [WHISPERING] What is it? - Guard called the police. How do you know? - [ESE] Shit! - [GUARD] Hey! [BANGS] Who's there? Deniz. - [GÖKHAN] What? - Come here. [GUARD] I called the police, man. You're all totally fucked now. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Ese. - Are you okay? - Fine. [GÖKHAN GRUNTS] [SIREN WAILING] Open! Open for fuck's sake! You hide over there. I'll get the police to chase me. - Okay. - [DENIZ] Okay. - Let's meet at your house, okay? - Okay. Careful. [ENGINE REVS] [OFFICER] He's there. Don't lose him! [SIREN WAILS] ["SAĞI SOLU KES" BY GAZAPIZM PLAYING] [SIREN WAILING] [BARKING] [SONG CONTINUES] [TIRES SQUEALING] [ENGINE ROARS] He's there! The suspect is escaping towards Taşköprü Street. [ROOSTER CROWS] Blondie, what are you looking at? [GÖKHAN] Oh. Ese! - Where's the bike? - [ESE] We'll talk about it later. Deniz. Why are you here? You have the audition. I was worried something might have happened to you. - I'm going home now. - Deniz. Listen to me. I'm really sorry it turned out like that. I'm sorry. [SIGHS] I was telling people, "Ese isn't what you think. He's a good guy." And look at what you just did. You stole something. Just so you wouldn't have to accept money from your rich girlfriend. [KADIR] Good morning. Why are you up so early? So you got the new parts, man? Gökhan, where did you get these? - Tike, come here. - [TIKE] What are you all doing here? Whoa, what's that? The parts have been found. But how'd you pull this off? How did you manage to do this, Gökhan? We don't have any cash. Gökhan? If you've done something shady, I'll fire you, I swear to God. Tike. It's all good. Deniz gave us the money. Without her, we'd just be unidentified forgotten objects. Oh, really? God bless you, Deniz. - [KADIR] Let's go, Let's put it together. - Come on. [KADIR] Let's put it together. We gotta warm it up. - Okay, Ese? - Stop your sulking. Come here! What is it? What's happening? Deniz paid for the missing parts. We can still compete. - [TÜLAY] What, really? - Deniz! Thank you. [TÜLAY] Thank you, dear. Have a nice day, you guys. Deniz. - Ese, let go of my arm! Let go! - Deniz. [SNAPS] You gotta audition, okay? All right? How will we get there? Yusuf! - Boncuk still here? - Bro, come on. Dad's gonna kill me! Is it still here? Shh. Quiet. Why is it called "Boncuk"? Beautiful. I want it back clean, just like this. - And get to stay over for a week. - Okay. [YUSUF] Let's go. [MAN] Stop! Stop! Hey! Boncuk! Boncuk! Boncuk! Come back here! I know what I'll do to you! - We made quite an entrance! - You're just getting started. I know they're gonna love you. [KISSES] Take this. - You gonna wait for me? - Of course I will. All right. [GROANS] [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [SOUNDS MUFFLE] Bro, are you okay? Stay back. Call an ambulance. [LINE RINGING] Excuse me? Are you looking for that tattooed guy? - Yeah, I am. - Well, he fainted. - We took him to the infirmary. - Where is it? Exit through the gate there. It's on the right, about 500 meters ahead. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Ah, Boncuk. I know how to ride, but I just don't know that I know. I know how to ride, I just don't know. Just two blocks. I can make it. It's nothing. [SIGHS] [ENGINE IDLES] Ese? - Deniz. - What happened to you? The chase last night, and spending too much time in the sun. But I also disappointed you. God might be punishing me for that. Ese! What did the doctor say? He said, "Don't wait. Go out and live your life." - Are you sure? - Yes, I am sure. How was it? We'll find out when they post the results. - How did you ride this all the way here? - No! You sit and rest. I can drive it. We're racing against time. Can we make it? I learned from the future champion, didn't I? - Don't worry. Sit down. - [CHUCKLES] Glad we looked. You have a broken rib. Right now... [ENGINE ROARS] [CHANTING] Yaşar Tuning! Yaşar Tuning! - Yaşar Tuning! - Louder! Louder! What's that, a little kid's playground? - Yaşar Tuning! - [LAUGHING] What's that piece of shit? Science experiment made of spare parts? - What are you talking about? - Huh? [LAUGHS] Listen to me, I will rip your tongue out... Shut up. [ALL ARGUING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, you're gonna lecture me on this? [YELLING CONTINUES] Look! Look who's here! [SINGING] ♪ Here he is! Here he is! ♪ [BLOWS RASPBERRY] - ♪ Here he is!

[HORNS HONKING] Listen up, fellas, let's make this a gentleman's race. Tike, this bastard Yaşar asked for a tunnel race on purpose. They say his new rider is like a bullet train. [DENIZ] Tunnel race? We start before the sun begins to set. There are two tunnels. We enter the first at sunset, and exit the last before the sun sets. The road is under construction, so it's super dark inside. So whoever comes out first with his headlights on is the champion. [DENIZ] Hmm. I made it sound complicated but it's not. The guy who comes out first is the winner. It's really simple. [LAUGHS] Will you shut your mouth? Just shut your mouth. [ENGINES REV] - [KADIR] Get in! - Come on! [CHEERS] [TIKE] Using it with one hand... [GRUNTS] [INTENSE MUSIC PLAYING] [TIKE] If we enter the tunnel first, we're good. Come on, Ese! - He's coming, right? - He's blowing like the wind! Look at the indicator! Make that asshole Yaşar cry! [GÜLAY LAUGHS] "Asshole Tuning!" He's no repairman, he's a magician! [MOTOR SPUTTERS] Something's wrong! What happened? [ESE] Fuck! Come on! - The fuel hose came off! - He's lagging behind.

That was you. You kept your promise. [ESE GASPS] I wished I'd be e the champion, but only if you were there to see me. Ese! [SOBS] I can't believe... [GRUNTS] - But even that came true. - Ese!

Bravo! - She said she wouldn't try again, but... Somebody once taught me that I should never give up. It's not like a UFO will come and save you after all. - I'm surprised that you remember me. - You were pretty memorable. Where did you find the cool bike? My boyfriend found it. By the way, I know it's a bit unusual, but I'd like to ask you. May I sing one more song, if it's okay and there's enough time? I promised someone I'd ask. Go ahead, miss. All you. Thank you. Great.
