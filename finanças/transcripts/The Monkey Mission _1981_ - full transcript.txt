[ music box playing "Mary Had a little lamb" ] [ theme music playing ] I've been expecting you, Keys. Bad night for a gent to be on the streets. I know you did it. I don't know how you did it, or why you did it, but I know you did it. Don't think you're gonna pull it off, because I'm still here and the game is still on. Let me tell you a story. This story should start with "Once upon a time," but it starts with a phone call that I got from a rich lady in Ireland I worked for a couple years back. She wanted me to meet with a teabag over on this side... One of them international guys that works for anybody and does anything... if the price is right. You know me. Everything's a set-up in my book. So I arranged to meet with him on my turf... The Medici vase. It's Roman. 700 A.D. The only one to survive intact throughout history. The one vase took years to make. The cost... astronomical. Absolutely stunning. If you're going to mate with it, I don't wanna watch. This isn't the original, it's a copy. But a perfect copy... they're valued at over 20,000 pounds. I'm impressed. The original is worth over $3 million. It's recently surfaced in the Briarton family collection in San Clemente. I assume you've heard of them. It's hard to live in California and not. Why don't you get to the punch line, pal? The family I represent would like it returned. I'm prepared to offer you a substantial fee for its recovery. I'm a private dick, not a thief. Why don't you go to the heat? Simply put... the international authorities don't consider it stolen. You see... certain works of art are considered the property of whoever possesses it. The police only become interested when a piece is stolen from a public collection, such as the Da Vincis owned by the Italian government. A Da Vinci owned by a private citizen, for example, is virtually up for grabs. What did you say the original's worth? $3 million. My price is 150 gs. If you flinch, I'll be happy to walk. [ narrating ] He didn't flinch and I didn't walk. I took his money and the phony vase, and found myself casing the Briarton joint. Spiked fences, walls, guards and dogs... I didn't like none of it. The front looked like it would take a cannon to get through. The back looked like the Great Wall of China. It went on forever, but it also looked like my only shot. I felt along the top of the wall. There were no alarms. [ dogs barking ] [ narrating ] I made the dogs bark every chance I got so that people in the neighborhood would get used to hearing the noise. They barked so often even the guards stopped paying attention. By the third day, I had the guard patrol timed down to the second. Then it was time to make my move. [ meows ] Take it easy, Willy. You okay, pal? Huh? You okay? All right, slide your bones back in there again. Slide your bones back in there, Willy. Attaboy. Attaboy. [ barking ] [ hisses ] Okay, Willy boy. You ready to do your stuff, huh? I wish I was half as cool as you. All right, man. Do your stuff. Not so fast, you nut! [ door slams ] [ narrating ] I knew the alarm would go off as soon as I opened the door. If I could just move fast enough, I'd hit the room, switch the vases, and split, and everything would stay cool. [ alarm ringing ] Do you play gin rummy? What's the matter, Boy? You deaf? I asked you if you play gin. Come alive, boy. There's a man up here talking at you. Uh, gin? Yeah, gin, boy, gin. Yeah, gins fine. Oh. Huh-uh. That's Louis XIV, so park your butt in it with due respect. Come on, boy. Pour yourself a drink. It's the best bourbon money can buy. No. Woman: Mr. Briarton, are you all right? Well, the burglar alarm is ringing. Of course it is. This young man tripped it. Turn the darn thing off. Let's get down to playing cards. But I've already called the police. Well, you just pick up that phone and call them back. -[ gasps ] -[ coughing ] Deal! [ narrating ] So I dealt. It seemed like a good idea at the time, seeing as how he was the only guy in the whole joint on my side. My game plan was to find out what the hell happened to the vase, and everything else in the room. Kind of barren in here, ain't it, old man? Yeah, I had to give it all away. Donate it. You work all your life for something, and the government makes you give it all away, because of the damn taxes. After your money, are they? Do roosters try to get into the henhouse, huh? Gin. [ narrating ] He was a great old guy. The only question he asked was why I picked up an eight when there was three eights down already. By sun up, I had lost $12, and had found out where the vase was... in the Kinsey-Randolph museum. It might just as well have been in Fort Knox. But I didn't have time to get depressed, because that's when you entered the picture, Keyes. Good morning, Mr. Briarton. What are you doing here, Keyes? I don't want no more insurance. I was notified by the police the alarm system went off in here last night. Huh. What are you doing here, Dancer? Gin. Son, you'd better start keeping track of the discards. I keep track of the cards, Pop, but sometimes the cards just don't run your way. I always say it's better to be lucky than smart. When you're neither smart nor lucky, you shouldn't be in the game, Dancer. Thanks. I'll try to remember that. What do I owe you, Pop? Here. It's been fun. I've a hunch you'll do better next time. I wouldn't bet my life on it. Well, that would be placing a small bet, wouldn't I? [ chuckles turn to coughing ] You take care of yourself. I don't know what you're doing here, but you're on my turf again. And you're gonna get burned... again. Keyes, the last time you had all the best of it. My client hired me when the race was over. I was coming out of the starting gate and you and your insurance company were crossing the finish line. This time, watch yourself. [ phone rings ] Damn. What are you doing up so early? Charlie, I want you to rent me a kid. What? What did you just say? Yeah, you got a niece. I wanna borrow her for a couple of hours. My niece! Charlie, this is strictly legit. Joe, I'd sooner let my niece play on the freeways -than turn her over to you. -I don't wanna raise the kid. I just wanna use her for a couple of hours. Woman: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jennifer Atkins, and I will be your guide for the 10:30 tour. If you will just follow me, the tour will begin immediately. Next we'll see the Briarton room. Follow me, please. Excuse me. Uh-huh. The museum has just completed the setting for this gem of a collection. The Briarton collection is priceless. Among its other treasures, it contains one of the rarest art objects in the world: the Medici vase, one of three Toreumata Vitri carvings that is still intact. Is it any small wonder the curators seal this room off every evening with a two-inch-thick steel door? Steel door? Big deal. My brother says this place is a tin can. Anyone can get in here with a penknife. [ chuckles ] I'm sure your brother must be joking around with you, young lady. Don't tell me what my brother was doing. Well, they must have all kinds of alarms and things in a place like this, huh? Oh, yeah. My brother don't care, mister. If he said it, you better believe it. Well, the gentleman's right. Aside from the fact the only way to get into this room is the steel door that slides down and seals the room shut, there are some computer controlled alarm circuits on every window and door throughout the museum. Not to mention alarms in the hallways and display rooms themselves. All of course linked directly to the local police station. [ both chuckle ] Tell me straight, mister. Wait until I see my brother. -[ both laugh ] -Yeah. Mr. Briarton was fortunate enough to have acquired these paintings, and now we're fortunate enough to view them. You don't seem very interested in these paintings, sir. Is there any particular sort of art you care for? I'm a little more interested in form. Any form in particular? Yeah, curves. I like... you might say, sculptured art. Not here in the museum I'm afraid. There is a private collection you might enjoy seeing. Why don't I give you my phone number after the tour so we can arrange... a personal viewing? [ stammering ] I'm sure we'll both be greatly enriched. [ chuckles ] The Briarton room was donated by the Briarton family. From here, we will go on to the Adolph Kinsey room, which has the most definitive Italian Renaissance collection in the world. Everything seems to be fine, but I agree with you. Perhaps we should delve more deeply into the... Well... It's amazing what I'm learning about you: Your love of cards, your appreciation of the fine arts. Yeah. [ carnival music playing ] [ hand organ playing ] [ narrating ] For the last eight years, Jimmy Papadopoulos and his monkey had been working all over town with the organ, scrambling after nickels and dimes, and not being what he used to be. What Jimmy used to be was the best man-monkey sneak-thief combo on the West Coast. Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. Then Jimmy fell in with the wrong people. They almost did him in, but he lucked out and wound up working the carnies. [ whispers ] Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. -Gotcha. -[ squeals ] Joe Dancer. [ laughs ] So that's the deal, Jimmy. You and the monkey get 15 gs up front, and 15 gs when the caper's over. $30,000... That's a lot of organ grinding. That's a lot of anything. It's a strange thing for you to be doing, Joe. I don't understand this. You don't have to understand it. Are you in? Boy... Do you know how many miles me and this little guy must have walked, grinding that lousy organ? A million. You never knew what it was like, did you? Me and Gregor. We stayed in the best hotels. We did really good work. -Jimmy? -I know, Joe. I'm wandering a little. Yeah, we're in. [ laughs ] Okay, I'll be in touch, first thing in the morning. [ narrating ] I hadn't seen Stump Harris in a bunch of years. And yes, I knew where to find him. In the old days when I worked with him, he was the best systems and explosives man the feds had. I don't know what shot him down. All I know is one day he walked away from the world and wound up feeding fish. Hi, old man. Hi, kid. Joe's got something going. Something good. He wants to talk to you about it. Start talking. It's good to see you again, Stump. How have you been? I'm still here. And you? Six' two" and even. I thought you wanted to tell me something. Yeah. Yeah, I do. How about if I show you, Stump? -He looks grumpy. -He don't look happy. We'll talk him into it. What happened to him, Jimmy? What happened to his hand? -How come he quit living? -He never told you? He never told me. Well, I guess he never told anybody. Yeah, back to business. What do you think, Stump? It's a tough one. It kind of looks impregnable, don't it? Like Hitler's bunker. Well, how does Gregor fit in? Just cool it a sec, Jimmy. So we got problems, huh, Stump? -You got problems. -Yeah. There's no way? Let's do it. [ laughing ] [ narrating ] The rest of the day was all business. Tiny Beldon was a guy who worked in the city building authority, where the plans for every city building are kept, including the Kinsey-Randolph museum. Tiny wasn't a friend of mine, but I had the goods on him. He liked his girlfriends. I knew, but his wife didn't. -Wait a minute, Joe. -What's the matter? This ain't going to be so easy. What? Fracture circuits on all the windows, laser beams in all the halls, heat sensors throughout and in the Briarton room, weight sensors. What the hell is a weight sensor? A fly can set off a weight sensor. -Where are they? -In the floor. How the hell do we beat them? Tiny: Oh, Miss Jameson. Oh, Miss Jameson. [ moaning ] Stump: What, with the pressure sensors in the floor, you'll have the bells ringing from here to... Well, I don't know where. Jimmy: Stump, I don't know what you're squawking about. The monkey doesn't need to touch anything. We can fly him. There is no problem flying the monkey in. The problem is getting the monkey by that door into that room. Well, wait, wait wait wait. That's not a problem, Stump. All we gotta do is cut the alarms on the door, and it raises right up. Thank you. Will you come here and let me show you something? -Yeah. -That's the room, right? -Yeah. -That's the Briarton room, right? -Yes. -All right, all the circuits go to that door, right? -I know that. -What you don't know is that all those circuits are under three-and-a-half feet of concrete in the floor. You cannot beat that. -Oh. -Jimmy: Hey, wait a minute. I found an air shaft on the outside of the building. It's just big enough for Gregor. Look look. It leads right straight down inside to the room with the vase. I think you got something. Hey, Gregor, will you tell Jimmy it's one floor, two floors, three floors up, flat surface, reinforced steel? Even if we had double-strength acetylene torches, we're going to be hanging out there for a half an hour, with everybody to see us. Wait a minute, Stump. You're right, we can't hang outside the building. Maybe we could use the air shaft. Where's the specs on it? Here it is. Hey, Stump? It's mounted with a key lock three and a half feet back in the shaft. Now we can't get our arm in through that grid, you're right. We can't go in through it, Stump, but we could come out of it. We could get out that way. We can't get in. -Yeah. -I tell you how we go in. -We go in the front. -Dancer: Okay. -Blow the door. - Okay. Get the whole French foreign legion with AK-47s to get us the hell out of there. No, we can't do that. But you're right, we can go in through the front door and we come out through the air shaft. I thought you said we're going in through the vent. You can't get in. You're right, we can't. I said we can't go in through the air shaft, we're going out. Just wait a minute, Stump. I've got something going. Just let me think for a minute. You think too, Gregor. Got any ideas, speak right up. [ narrating ] I needed a couple of guys who could stand up to a hell of a lot of pressure. I knew Benny and Vito in Vietnam. The Vietcong had a game they used to play called "Tie the soldier to the stake." If you slumped or fell, the best thing that could happen was you died quick. When I walked into that prison camp, Benny and Vito were the only two guys still left standing. Dancer: I need two stand-Up guys. Guys that won't crack, guys that I can trust, because my bananas are going to be on the line. Does it pay more than rubbing cars? This caper pays you 20 gs apiece. 20 grand? Joe, come on. It ain't been a good day. I'm for real. But if you take the gig, I'm going to be hanging from a string. You guys are going to be on the other end, and if anybody lets go, it's going to be a long fall. What the hell kind of a job are you talking about? I don't care what kind of job it is, I'm in. Bolt cutter. Batteries. [ screeches ] -Hey, Jimmy? -Yeah? Come on over here, will you? I want you to put this over there on my table. Hey, go easy with that. That's c4 plastique. -These are explosives? -Yeah yeah, that's... [ stammering ] Hey hey hey! Whoa! [ gasps ] -You wanna try the monkey? -You wanna try this? I'll handle him. [ narrating ] Some problems I had anticipated, others I hadn't. Stump's job was to beat all the other systems. Me and Jimmy and the monkey were supposed to concentrate on the weight sensors in the Briarton room where the vase was. Like Stumps said... If a fly landed on that floor, the alarm would go off. Come on, Gregor. Get the block, Gregor. Jimmy: Oh, don't worry, Joe. Don't worry. He'll get it. This ain't gonna work, Jimmy. -Come on. Yes it is, Joe. -It ain't gonna work. Yes it is, Joe. Don't worry, it'll work. Jimmy, that monkey is a dunce. [ chuckles ] There it goes again. Okay, come on, boy. But, Jimmy, the other one keeps falling. Okay, well, let's take that one. -Yeah. -Let's switch. Okay, here we go. Yeah. Dancer: We're all going to jail. I wonder if they got a jail for monkeys. Okay, good boy. Good boy, Gregor. Here, we're gonna go again. Give you a treat. There you go. There you go. Come on. Come on, come on. Here we go. Now, Gregor. That's it. That's it, Gregor. Come along. Come along. Oh, good boy. Good, that's it. That's it, Gregor. Hold tight, Gregor. Hold tight. Hold tight, boy. That's it. -I got them. -You got what? Dentists' lead x-Ray aprons. I can see that. What the hell are they for? For the heat sensors. -This thing weighs a ton. -Yeah. The trick is not to give off any body heat. -This thing... -It's gotta be over your hands. Your hands give off body heat. This thing weighs a ton. Well, come on. Stand up. Give it a try. You can get used to it. [ grunts ] This thing weighs a ton. [ chuckles ] See, here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Good boy. No no. That's enough. That's enough. Jimmy, you might be getting close. Right right. Okay, let's go back. Okay, let's go back. Come on, Gregor. That's it. That's it. Come on. Come on. Oh, good boy. Good boy. Oh, good boy. Good boy. -Hey, good boy. -[ block clatters ] Here you go. There you go. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay, we'll get him to exchange now. -Okay okay? -Oh, okay. Now you're gonna take it. Gregor, look. This is here. Pick this one up. Why is he stopping? It's okay. Take the block. Take the block. Gregor, Gregor, now pay attention. Gregor. Relax, Joe. He's just getting tired. He's gonna be fine. Pay attention... Gregor, pay attention. Now take the block. Okay, okay, come on, we'll start again. Hey Joe, I'll take that. You take this. Right there. Okay, kid. That's enough. Here, take that. You're supposed to put this one down. [ chuckles ] Here. Jimmy: Joe, give him his reward. That works. All right, don't worry. I can make it. Dancer: Are you sure? If you can't, we can rig something. I said I can make it. [ groaning ] That's it. That's the last car for 15 minutes. Let's cut that alarm wire, Stump. Let's go. [ grunts ] All right. Dancer: How do you know which alarm wire goes to the door? I don't. Oh. The guards are on the other side of the museum for the next 10 minutes. How's it going with the camera wires? It's going. [ narrating ] Stumps' gag was to cut the camera wire in the hall where we were going to walk so it would show a blank picture on the monitor screen. Then he would feed another wire from another camera to that blank screen. If the gag worked, both screens would show the same empty hall. You got it. All right, you two guys, keep it loose now. Give it to me one more time. Wait for the bang, count to 10. -And be careful. -You too. Good luck. -Jimmy? -Clear! [ narrating ] We were all praying Stump got the right wires, and that the camera was dead. If it wasn't, we were. Hey, that's enough. Wait a minute. This is it, Stump. That's the lasers. Get it all put together. Try another, Jimmy. Keep it low. -There it is. -I can see it. I can see it. Keep it low, so I know what I'm doing. Go easy. -Okay. -Go easy. Push her, push her, push her. Hold it. Hold it right there. Hold it. Jimmy, give me some on this side. Way over here. Way over here. Okay, okay. We broke it. Perfect. Here I go. -Don't touch that thing, Jimmy. -Right, right. Okay, okay. There you go. There you go. Easy. Easy with the bags. Take it easy. Here it comes. We're here. That's the foyer to the Briarton room. Heat sensors. Where's the explosive for the camera? Right here. -Right. -Let's put the coats on. Yeah, okay. -Jimmy, listen. -Yeah? I want you to take all of the stuff out of our bags that we don't need. Okay, go to it. [ grunting ] -Jimmy. -Yeah? Now... Jimmy... hang on. This thing weighs a ton. Okay. Oh, where's your hand? -Here. -Now remember... When we blow the door, you take out that camera. -Okay. -Okay. Let's go for it. Yeah. What the hell? [ alarm ringing ] The Briarton room, on the double. -Ready? -Yeah. Okay, hold it. Wait for the bangs. Wait for the bangs. Three, four, five. Seven, eight, nine, let's go. Check the room. Come one, come on, come on! -I'm coming! -Yeah! Freeze! Up against the car. Spread 'em. Security guard: So when I saw the two guys on the monitor, that's when I hit the alarm. You mean to tell me that they made it all the way through the museum to the Briarton room without being seen or tripping an alarm? Afraid so. I couldn't figure it out. I mean, I keep a pretty sharp eye on those monitors. I'm sure you do. Amazing. They used those to beat the heat sensors. No kidding. Well, Keyes, you got lucky. It looks like they used a little too much fourth of July. Near as we can tell, none of the artwork was badly damaged by the blast. Of course, the experts will be here in the morning to check. That blast didn't do this, did it? No, they used a separate charge on the camera. Hey, Keyes, we got a couple guys outside. You wanna take a look at them? See if you recognize them? You better believe it. Excuse me. Right in there, Keyes. Well well well, Mr. Dancer... These two? That's it? That's it. There must be somebody else. There has got to have been somebody else involved. So fortunately for both of us, nothing was taken or seriously damaged. Were there any substitutions? Oh, a duplicate. That's the first thing that we thought of. But I can assure you all our originals are just that. They are original. Are you sure? Well, I wanna have a look at the collection. Mr. Keyes, I've gone over every inch of this exhibit. However, I suppose that's your job, isn't it? How long is this going to take? Estimate two days. The work should be completed by tomorrow evening. [ narrating ] So that was the plan, Keyes... To blast open the wall so we could crawl inside, and wait for things to go back to normal. It was gonna be a long wait. Where's the monkey? -Jimmy! -Yeah? Get the monkey. Shh, call him. Gregor. Gregor, come back. Come back. Come on, come on. Jimmy, he's gonna put us all in the slammer. Banana, Gregor. Banana. Oh my goodness. Well, he is a thief. Hope the guy out there don't need this screwdriver. Now take care of him, will you? Come here, come on. [ narrating ] Our game plan was to sleep our way through the day and do our work at night, but I couldn't sleep. You were out there, Keyes. I knew you were trying to break Benny and Vito. If they could just hold up, they could pull their year in the joint, get their money, and get out clean. But if they broke, we'd all fry. So you've cooperated with the police. You have signed the confession. You have waived your rights. Maybe the police believe you, but I don't, because you haven't told me how Joe Dancer is involved. -I don't know any Joe Dancer. -No? I've been following Joe Dancer for the last two weeks. I saw him at the Briarton mansion and at the Kinsey-Randolph museum. Look, I don't know anybody by that name. We did the job. We got caught. What more do you want? A liquor store, yeah. A gas station, yeah. But the Kinsey-Randolph museum? What do you know about art? Who was Grant Wood? What century did Claude Monet live in? -Stump: Hey, Joe. -Huh? Stump: It's time to hit that thermostat. Right. Jimmy! -Yeah? -Drill. Here, take this light. Give me the drill. -Put the light up there... -I know. So it shines down here. I loosened all the screws up, so just lift that plate off of there. Don't nick one of these wires, because if you do, you're going to cause a short and change the impedance. That thing's gonna shut off, and the guards will be here in five minutes. -Thank you very much. -Who taught you that? What, are you keeping score? [ narrating ] Jimmy and Stump were getting some sleep while I was babysitting the monkey. I was hoping the air-Shaft escape gag would work. If it didn't, we were going to be hermetically sealed for eternity, and they'd find us the way they found the mummies. Shh. [ squealing ] Shh shh shh shh. The next night we were gonna go for the vase. The caper had taken on a life of its own, Keyes. Beyond the guards, beyond the alarms, beyond the museum, more than anything else in the world, I wanted to beat you. And I started wishing for a million things, but most of all, I was wishing you'd have a stroke. Morning came. Everybody was getting a little edgy. Joe, let me by, please? Yeah, give me a minute. -Joe, let me by. -Give me a minute, will you? I'm almost through. Joe, I gotta go. I have to go to the bathroom bad. Oh, okay. Wait a minute. wait a minute. -Okay. -Watch your head. -Okay. [narrating ] I was trying to sleep my way through the day, Keyes, but I kept thinking about you. Vito! Are you the one with the electronics degree or is that Benny? Let's review your list of accomplishments. You cross-circuited a closed-circuit television camera so that the guard didn't even notice. You designed and built a complicated prism reflector to bypass a light beam. Are you the one who designed it? Or is that your buddy? And the coats... The wonderful coats. Which one of you geniuses figured out that the only way to get past the heat sensors was to cover yourself with lead? You know Joe dancer, don't you? No, no. Sure you do. You can't do this. I can do anything I wish. Now tell me about Dancer. It's showtime. Now remember... We get out of here tonight. We split up. Tomorrow morning we meet 10:00 in a park. -Right. -Let's get what we came for. Put it out. He's there. He's right outside again. Jimmy: I think he's crazy. And if he's crazy, he can keep this up forever, but I can't. Joe, maybe we ought to pack it up and blow. No, Jimmy. Not yet. Then when? I can't take too much more of this. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. Tonight and tomorrow night, if we don't score, we leave without the goods and you can keep the money. Nobody beats me, Dancer. Nobody. Well, the repairs have been completed, and fortunately none of the pieces were damaged, so we're very happy to announce the re-opening of the Briarton collection. Now, Miss Gordon, they are all yours. This way, please. The Briarton collection was donated by the Briarton family. [ narrating ] I stood there watching the people wander through the room. I was waiting to see you. After a while when you didn't show, I knew you weren't going to. You were somewhere out there on the streets, Keyes. Looking for me. I could feel it. I knew. You were out there looking for me. All right, it's showtime. Now remember, we get out of here tonight. Tomorrow morning, we meet at 10:00 in the park. Let's get what we came for. Hey, Joey, thanks. For what? For making me and Jimmy breathe again. Let's just hope we hit a homerun, partner. Which end goes out first? That's it. Right there. You got it. Oh man, this thing weighs a ton. Yeah. [ Dancer grunts ] Bring the mirror down a little. No no, bring the front of the gizmo up a little. I can't see a damn thing. You don't have to see. I'm driving. -You mind? I'll tell you. -Okay okay okay, go. -Up a little more. -Up? -Up a little more. -Okay. All right. You ain't going to take a picture of nobody. -We in? -Yeah, that's it. -Get it in. -Yeah, get... -Is it down yet? -Yeah. -Okay, let me have it. -Go. [ grunts ] Okay, next trick. Hold it steady. We got it. That's beautiful. -I got it. -You got it? Okay, Jimmy, get the monkey ready. Couldn't it wait until morning? No, it can't wait. Tell me where Joe Dancer is. We don't know. Your Marine Corps records came in from Washington earlier this evening. You were in 'Nam with Dancer. Don't mess with me. You're lying. Dancer hired you. He trained you. Nobody hired us. Vase. Easy, Gregor. Easy. Thattaboy. Attaboy, Gregor. Attaboy. Do what I told you, now. [ screeches ] Oh, hang on, Gregor. Come on, that's it. Keep going. Easy, Gregor. Easy. Careful. Put it down. Now, Gregor. Listen listen. Gregor. Dancer: Come on, monkey. Get the other vase! Gregor, Gregor, listen. Change the vases. Change the vases. Tell him to pick the other vase up. Gregor, Gregor, now listen. Gregor. Why is he scratching his tail? Why don't he get the vase? What the hell is he waiting for? Gregor! Bring it here. Come on, come on. I'll kill that monkey. I'm gonna kill him. [ Dancer groans ] -Gregor. -What's he waiting for? Tell him to move. -Good boy, good boy. -Bring it here, monkey. Thattaboy. Bring it here. Jimmy: Come on, Gregor. Hop on the case. That's it. That's it. Gregor, on the rope. Back on the rope, Gregor. Gregor. Dancer: I told you that monkey was a dunce. Jimmy: On the rope, Gregor. Get back on. -What's he waiting for? -Gregor! Dancer: He's gonna put us all in the slammer. - Come on, monkey. -Gregor, Gregor, listen. -Listen, sit! -Why is he standing there? Come on monkey, please. - Tell him to bring the vase. -Gregor! Gregor! Don't drop it! Gregor! -Get in here. -Come on, boy. Attaboy. [ squeals ] -Good boy. -Thattaboy. Thattaboy. Right here. Good boy, Gregor. Good boy. Good boy. -Three million bucks. -Yeah. It looks just like the other one, don't it? You don't appreciate art. -Let's get the hell out of here. -Right. The camera. Why did you blow the camera? Why didn't you just trick it like you did the other camera? -Uh-Oh. -What's the matter? The vase ain't in the right place. -So what? - What do you mean "So what?" One of the guards comes around, sees that, the jig's up. We'll all be in the slammer. You gotta send him back. Wait a minute. You blew the door, and then you blew the camera... Which means... you wanted to be seen. [ chuckles ] You wanted to be seen. Dancer knew you would be seen, didn't he? [ laughs ] He knew the alarm would go off. You two were supposed to be caught. And Joe Dancer is still in there, huh? [ chuckles ] Come on, let's go. All right, Gregor. All right, Gregor. Go boy, go boy. That's a boy. Good boy. Now, Gregor. Gregor, push the vase. Push the vase over. That's a boy. That's a boy. No, Jimmy, he's pushing it further - Over the other way. -Gregor! Just calm down. just calm him down. Gregor, easy boy, easy. Just let him sit there for a minute. Gregor, listen. Listen listen listen, Gregor, Gregor, listen. - That's a boy. -Let it go. -Bring him back. -All right, okay. Gregor, come back, come back. That's a boy. Come, Gregor, come along. Come along. That's it. That's it. -That's a good boy. -That a boy. -Come here. -Come on, Gregor. -Gregor, Gregor, come on. -Come here, come here. -Come on, boy. -I'll get him. Come on, boy. Come on, Gregor. -Gregor! -[ shrieks ] Gregor, Gregor. Stop that and get in here. Can't they go any faster? Hit the siren. Okay, hit the reds. Okay, Stump, you got the ball. Blast it. How do I look? When I blast it, that arrow should fall clear of the pedestal. And that line will hang it on the bannister. It won't touch the floor. Should? Okay. -See? -Yeah. Hang on. You got it? Yeah, okay. Go get it. Don't hit the case now. I'm not gonna hit the case. Well, it was shaking. All right, you're there. Hook it. Once more. Once more. Have you got it? Wait a minute. wait a minute. All right, go easy. All right. Okay, let me take up the slack. Wait, it's all gotta come together. Wiggle it. Wait a minute, Stump. It's stuck. I see it. I see it. It's loose, Stump. You got it. Be careful. Here it comes. Bring it back, Stump. Oh, steady it! Now wait a minute. Easy. That's it. That's it. I can get it. I got it. I got it. [ laughing ] -Come on, come on. let's go. -Let's go. Let's jam. Okay, Jimmy, you're up. Come here, little guy. Attaboy, Gregor. Attaboy. Don't just stand there. Check everything. Check that armor over there. Check everything! [ grunting ] Dancer: Hang on, Jimmy. Hang on. Attaboy. Attaboy, Jimmy. I'm okay. Attaboy, Jimmy. Pull that leg up, will you? [ grunting ] Stay right there. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. -Don't start climbing. -Who's climbing? Jeez. Okay, put your feet on me. [ muttering ] Hold it a minute. Hold it a minute. Give me a breather. Let's go. -Move your foot over, Stump. -Which one? [ grunting ] This is where it starts up. You think you need the rope? I don't need the rope. Come on. Here, you take him. Dancer: Stay with me, Stump. You know, I'm getting a little old for this. -That's it. -Mm-Hmm. Gregor, Gregor, lock. Remember... Lock, lock. Okay, that's it. -Bags first. -Okay. -You got the rope? -Yeah, right here. Okay Jimmy, let's dance. -You ready? -Yeah. Now, Joe, don't forget Gregor's leash. Take it off. -I won't forget his leash. -Okay, hold it. Hang on to the monkey, Stump. -I got him. I got him. -Okay. [ screeches ] Gregor, Gregor, Gregor. Let me give you a hand, Jimmy. -Okay. Okay, Joe, I got the rope. What if I break something? How the hell am I gonna pay for this on my salary? I'm the insurance company. I'll pay for it. [ grunts ] Jimmy, stop moving so much, will you? Keep it steady. Get your feet on the wall, Jimmy. Get your feet on the wall. I'm trying, Joe. I'm trying. -You okay, Stump? -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hang on, Stump. Hang on. Get your weight off of me for a minute. Hold the rope steady, Jimmy. Yeah, yeah. -Are we there yet? -Not yet, Joe. Here I come, Stump. Watch out, Jimmy. Okay. Tell him to throw the rope down. All right, Gregor. The rope. Throw the rope. Jimmy, tell him to throw the rope down. Gregor, the rope! Throw the rope! Come on, the rope. Good boy, Gregor. Good boy. Attaboy. Now tell him to close it and lock it. Gregor, close it. -Great. -Now lock it. Lock it, Gregor. Tell him to get in there and lock it! No banana, Gregor. No banana unless you lock it. Jimmy, where the hell is the monkey? -Lock it, Gregor. lock it. -Lock it. Come on, will you? Call the monkey out. Jimmy: See, Joe? What did I tell you? [ laughs ] -Okay, call him down. -Okay. Now Gregor, jump. Jump, Gregor. Jump. Jimmy, why ain't the monkey jumping? He's scared of heights. He's scared of heights? Now you tell me he's scared of heights? Get him down here before I kill him. Monkey, get down here! I don't like you in the first place. Not so loud, Joe. You'll scare him to death. Well, that's good. At least if he croaks, he'll fall down and we can get the hell out of here. Hey, Jimmy, is the monkey coming down? -Joe, give me your wallet. -What? You want him to come down, don't you? -Yeah. -Then give me your wallet. What, are you nuts or something? Get the monkey down here, will you? Turn around. I stole a $300 million vase... Bend over. Bend over. And I'm sitting here with my fanny... Pretend Gregor can't see you. Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. That's me, the sucker. Millions of guards all over the place, and I'm playing hide-And-Go-Seek with a chimp. Gregor, sucker. Wiggle, Joe. He can't see it. Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. [ chuckles ] I stole a jillion dollar vase, and I'm wiggling my rear end for the monkey. Oh, brother. Sucker, Gregor. Sucker. I told you he was a natural-born thief. All right, I got the goods. You guys get the bags, and I'll see you tomorrow morning, 10:00 in the park, right? -Right. -Joey? -Yeah, yeah? Thanks again. There's nothing here, Keyes. Nothing that isn't supposed to be. Let's go. Where are you? [ narrating ] I thought I'd sleep like a log that night after the score, but you know something? I didn't sleep a wink, Keyes. So I bundled up the 30 gs that I owed Jimmy and Stump, and I went to the park to wait for them. They were supposed to show at 10:00 to pick up their dough, but at noon I was still waiting, and worrying. In my line of work, you learn one thing early... Don't get close to anybody, and don't work with anybody you make the mistake of getting close to. They weren't gonna show, and all I could think about was the bad things that happened to them. All I could see was Jimmy and Stump and the monkey hurt or dead. I checked the morgue, the hospital, the police station... Nothing. I went over to Stump's. The place was cleaned out. It started me thinking. Who was doing what to who? Were they in trouble or was I in trouble? Sometimes you think you know people, Keyes, and you tell yourself you know the good guys from the bad guys. But I was beginning to think I didn't know nothing about nothing. -Hello, lady. -What do you want, mister? What do you want? Jimmy, I want little Jimmy. Where is he? -I don't know. -The little guy who lived here. -Where is he? -He's gone. [ narrating ] I got back to the beach at just about sundown. I had a garage down there where I stashed the vase. Nobody knew about it except me, Stump and Jimmy. I was afraid of what I would find when I got there... Or what I wouldn't find. Yeah, teabag? This is the man. I can't deliver. [ narrating ] It was all over and I had been had. I sat in that garage all night soaking up booze. I can't tell you why, but I had a feeling. [ phone rings ] When did you get the vase? Hey, Joe, that's not the way it was meant. What are you gonna do if I come after you? You're not gonna come after us. Woman over P.A.: Trans world airlines, flight one... Dancer: Just another job, huh? It's the way you laid it out. Oh, we're sending back that 30 grand you already laid out for us. Yeah, you can keep the rest of it. $28,600. -Jimmy says... -I heard Jimmy. We spent the rest of it on clothes. This is the way it ends, huh, Stump? Hey now, Joe, Jimmy and me, we picked our life. You picked yours. We wound up with nothing. Then you come along, you gave us another shot and we took it. What did you expect us to do? You better start thinking, Joe. What's going to happen to you? Because sure in the hell when you're old, you're gonna wind up with nothing. I sure hope someone comes along like you, and gives you another shot. [ hangs up ] So that's my story. Where are they? No, Keyes. That horse ain't running. Does my story change your ending? I see. Long as I keep my mouth shut, as long as you keep your mouth shut... That fake vase can stay in the museum until hell freezes over. And my company doesn't have to pay $3 million insurance. By the way, what about the Englishman? Now that we have our other business straightened out, I would like to take another minute or two of your time. I figure I'm about 100 grand short. That's a tidy sum. Well, I thought that seeing as how your company is as large as it is, and you're still an important man in it, you could throw a little investigative work my way. Who would have guessed that when I saw you for the first time there at Mr. Briarton's estate that we would become so irrevocably linked. Keyes, like the man said in the movie, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." [ closing music playing ]
