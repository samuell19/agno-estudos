[plane propeller whirring] [atmospheric electronic music] [atmospheric piano music] [plane whirring] [dramatic electronic music] - [Darren] Mayday, mayday, mayday, I can't control it! I'm rolling, I'm rolling! - Oh, my God! - Hold on! - [Darren] Help, help! [plane rolling] [plane diving] [alarm wailing] - [Man] Well, see if you can see the tops of the ridge there or not? Just let me know if you see anything down there that doesn't look right. - Nah, not seeing anything else around that area. [atmospheric orchestral music] - [Bryan] What is it, Mitch? - Mr. Hawes we, we lost one. - [Newscaster] Search and rescue teams don't know who was onboard or whether anyone survived. - It was Darren's plane? - Yes, sir. - Was there anyone with him? - This is such a tragic situation. - Yeah, we lost contact with them 23 minutes ago. Based on the flight plan, that's a search area of, - [Woman] Yeah, lot's of remote places. - 1168 square miles. - [Female] That's a pretty good area. Possibly one of the most remote. - Yeah, a pilot and two passengers. - [Man] We know that there were three occupants in the plane, two males and a female. - [Bryan] Don't tell me you don't know where they are. - [Man] Sir, I'm just telling you what they told me. - [Rescuer] At this point we're hoping that daylight helps us and that we can actually see something, but we have not found anything that we can correlate to the missing persons or the plane. [birds chirping] [Richard breathing heavily] [dramatic electronic music] [man screaming] [Richard breathing heavily] [dramatic electronic music] - We rejoice in our sufferings. We rejoice in our sufferings. Knowing that suffering produces endurance. Suffering produces endurance. [gasping] [birds chirping] [Richard groaning] Rachel? [dramatic electronic music] [Richard breathing heavily] [groaning] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no. [groaning] [gasping] [groaning] Rachel? [breathing heavily] [groaning] [crying] [screaming] Okay. [groaning] Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, nobody. [crying] No, no, no, nobody. Stop bleeding, stop bleeding, stop. [breathing heavily] [fabric tearing] [Richard breathing heavily] [groaning] Rachel? Rachel? [groaning] Rachel? [groaning] Rachel? Rachel? [breathing heavily] Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? [breathing heavily] Oh, God, oh, God. Where is she? [atmospheric piano music] No, no, no, no, no. No, no. [heaving] God. [coughing] [gasping] [dramatic orchestral music] [fire crackling] [insects chirping] [birds chirping] [Richard breathing heavily] [atmospheric piano music] [water splashing] Another bad night? Another bad night. Murray called. The partner's in Dubai accepted that offer. I've gotta go close the deal. Rachel, I know this is difficult for you, but I've tried everything I can to try to help you, and nothing is working. Maybe you do need to go talk to somebody. [sighing] God knows you're not talking to me. We've gotta move on. Baby, we can't keep going like this. I can't keep going like this. It happened. There's nothing we can do about it. - Just go. - Rachel, please. - Just go. [atmospheric orchestral music] - I'll call you when I land. [birds chirping] [Rachel crying] [atmospheric piano music] What is the point in staring at it? This is not unusual Rachel. You heard what Dr. Norris said. This happens to a lot of people. [Rachel crying] And listening to crap like what your sister said, that God needs another angel, that's just making it worse. You gotta let it go. - You said you would call. - What? - Last week when you went to Dubai. You said you'd call when you landed, but you didn't call. - We got called right into the meeting as soon as I landed. I couldn't help that. Ah, look, okay, we're not talking about that Rachel. We're talking about this. It has been four months. You have got to start healing. For us. For me. - You promised you'd call. [crying] My baby. [crying] More, more than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, [crying] knowing that sufferings produce endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. [crying] [dramatic orchestral music] - Rachel? [birds chirping] [Richard groaning] [breathing heavily] [water splashing] [Richard coughing] [groaning] [breathing heavily] You need more angels? Hello? Hello? I need help. Great. - [Rachel] Richard. [atmospheric electronic music] - Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? - [Rachel] Richard. [dramatic orchestral music] - [Richard] Rachel. Rachel, keep talking, where are you? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? [groaning] [atmospheric piano music] Rachel. Baby. - Richard. - Oh, baby. I, um, I gotta go out. - Okay. - [sighing] Yeah, the finance team is coming back from Mexico City early. You know, that deal's been hanging by a thread, so we've gotta strategize. - On a Sunday? - Yes, on a Sunday. We've gotta get ready. You know this is a huge deal Rachel. - Okay. Richard, can we just talk? Can we just talk for a minute? - Right now? - Well, yeah, I wanted to talk about what's been-- - You wanna talk about that now? Huh. - Richard, I just thought-- - For six months, Rachel, six months I have been begging you to talk to me and you won't open your mouth at all, and now I've gotta go prepare for the biggest deal of the year and you wanna open up? No, I'm not gonna talk. I've gotta make a living. Besides, you've got your church people and your sister to talk to and that book to talk to. What do you need me for? Look. I gotta go. [atmospheric orchestral music] [birds chirping] Oh, baby. - When I step it really hurts, and I can't move my leg. [Rachel gasping] - Okay, okay, um, you're gonna be okay, baby. Alright? - And my stomach. [Rachel gasping] Am I bleeding on the inside? - No, no, it's just a bruise from the seatbelt. I'm gonna pick you up, [Rachel groaning] and keep it comfortable. [Rachel groaning] Don't, I'll do it, I'll do it. I'll do it, I'll do it, I'll do it. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, you okay? - No. [sighing] - Don't move your legs, I'm gonna save you, baby. Just, just, be still. [Rachel gasping] [Rachel groaning] It's okay, it's okay. [Rachel groaning] It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. [Rachel groaning] It's okay, it's okay. Oh, baby. - Richard? - It's okay. We're gonna get out of here, alright? - What happened? What happened? - I don't know. The plane, it just, the plane starting shaking and then we started spinning and falling, and I don't remember anything after that. I don't know. - The pilot, Darren, what happened? Is he alright? [crying] Oh, God. - It's okay, baby, I'm gonna get you outta here. - Well, where, where is here? - One thing at a time. I've gotta get you back. - [Rachel] Back where? - Okay, to the plane. We'll find shelter there. I can keep you warm, and, and if somebody comes looking for us, that's gonna be the first place they're gonna look, alright? - I can't walk. - Baby, I know that. I know you can't walk, [Rachel crying] I'm gonna figure this out. I promise you, I will figure this out, but I've gotta go, I'll be back. I promise, I'll be back. - No, you're leaving? Richard, no, no, no. - Rachel please, it's alright. - No, please, don't do this. I'll be back. - Rich, please don't leave me. Please. [groaning] [Richard groaning] [Rachel breathing heavily] I didn't know where you were. Oh, God, your arm. Oh. - It's okay. I'll stop the bleeding later. It slowed down. I thought you were dead. - Uh-huh. You know what I was thinking about before we got here? - What? - [Rachel] [chuckling] Our honeymoon. Do, do you remember? - Of course I remember. Bermuda. [chuckling] The cocktails, the beach. - Mm. I remember sitting and watching the sunset. We talked all night long, waited for the sun to come back up. Do you remember? - We really did that, didn't we? - Mm-hmm. Do you remember what it cost? - Huh, yes, I remember what it cost. I didn't think we'd have enough money to pay the rent, but we got by. I didn't think we'd have enough money to pay any of the bills. - No, do you remember you saying, we were afraid we were gonna not have gas? - We would not have enough gas to get home. [laughing] I'm glad those days are behind us. - Really? - Absolutely. - I don't know. I remember how simple those times were. - Simple? - Yeah. - That was a struggle. It wasn't simple. Everyday was a struggle. - Look, that's not what I mean. Simple like we didn't have much but we didn't need much. - I remember it more like we didn't want much because we didn't have anyway to get anything anyway. - I don't know, there's something really simple about that time. That time in our lives when we didn't have the big house or the cars. The wine cellar. Just, just us. It was nice. - Yeah, just us in a 750 square foot home with no hot water. [Rachel chuckling] Do you remember that? - I remember. You know sometimes I think about how things would be if I-- - Rachel, stop. I've gotta take care of you. I've gotta get you back to the plane, okay? Trust me. Trust me. I promise. [atmospheric electronic music] [Richard breathing heavily] [atmospheric piano music] [plane debris clacking] Rachel? Rachel, I'm back. I'm back. Okay, I've got this figured out, okay? Alright. You've gotta trust me, alright? I've got to get you out. - Richard, this is-- - I've gotta get you back, just trust me. Alright. - I can't do it, - I've gotta, - I can't do it. - We're gonna, we're gonna do this. - No, no, no, no, no. - You've got to trust me. Here, c'mon. - I, no. - Be careful with your. - No, no. - C'mon, oh, it's okay. - No! [gasping] Oh, no. - It's okay. It's okay. [dramatic orchestral music] [Rachel crying] I'm sorry. [Rachel crying] I'm sorry, okay, okay, okay, sit down, it's okay. [Rachel crying] [Rachel screaming] I've gotta get you back. Lay back, lay down, lay down. Lay down. - Okay. - It's okay. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Lean back this way. Lean back this way. Okay, okay. [Rachel gasping] Here, lean back, no, no, no, c'mon. Come this way, that's it. - Okay. I can't. - Okay, alright. You're gonna be okay. - Richard. - We're gonna be okay. - Listen to me. Oh, please, no, no, no. Rachel crying. - Gotta get you back. Gotta get you back. [Richard grunting] [Rachel crying] [Richard grunting] [Rachel screaming] I'm sorry, baby. - No, stop, please! - I'm sorry. - No, please! Stop, please stop! [Richard crying] - I'm so sorry. - Please! - I'm sorry, alright? I'm sorry I don't find comfort in the things that you do. I'm sorry that I don't find comfort in that. - Well exactly what do you find comfort in, Richard? Or should I say where do you find comfort? 'Cause you're never home. - I am working, Rachel. I'm trying to make a living for us, okay? I'm trying to support your habit. - I haven't taken those in months. I haven't needed them. - Oh, right, you haven't needed them because of your new little friend. Let me show you what I think of your new little friend. - You know, maybe you should start reading it instead of throwing it around. You know, before things get worse. - How are things supposed to get any worse that this Rachel, huh? - It's changing my life, Richard. - Stop it. Just stop it. If that voodoo crap is working for you, so be it, but don't try to get me onboard with it. - With what? With maybe the idea that there's a plan for everything? - A plan? - And a reason, yeah. - A plan, what is the plan, Rachel? Was the great plan for you to have a miscarriage? For us to lose our baby? Was part of his magic plan for you to get hooked on drugs? To go into a coma for six months? Was part of the plan to ruin our marriage? - Is that where we are? - I don't know where we are anymore, Rachel. - Well maybe now we need that more than ever. - Look at me. You do whatever you feel you have to do, but you leave me out of it. [Rachel crying] [ominous electronic music] [glass shattering] Just a little bit further. [Rachel crying] [Richard breathing heavily] - No. [crying] No. - Just a little further. - Rich, no. [crying] [Richard grunting] [Rachel crying] Oh, God, no, Rich, please. Please, stop, please, stop, please, just for a minute, please stop. [Richard breathing heavily] [Rachel crying] [Rachel crying] - You need some water. Here. Here. [breathing heavily] Not exactly what you had planned, huh? - What? - This trip. Not exactly what you had in mind. [Rachel laughing] [Rachel coughing] - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Sorry I made you laugh. - I love it when you make me laugh. - You used to laugh all the time. - I'm so sorry. We shouldn't even be out here. - No, stop. You have nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who should. - We both have things we're sorry for. - We can talk about all this later. I've gotta take you a little deeper into the woods. - I think we need to talk about his right now. [dramatic piano music] - No, we said we'd talk about it after the trip. I've gotta get you deeper into the woods. Just a little bit further. You know what? Here, trust me, okay? Okay? - Okay. Okay. - It's okay. [Richard groaning] I gotta get you back. [Rachel crying] [Richard grunting] Okay, okay, okay, be careful. Be careful. Be careful with your leg. - Hang on. - Alright, okay. [Rachel groaning] Okay. Okay. [breathing heavily] We'll be safer here. This fire's gonna burn out soon. I gotta get some more wood. You keep your eyes open while I'm gone. Okay? [atmospheric electronic music] - More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings because we know sufferings produce endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. [atmospheric piano music] [Richard breathing heavily] [ominous orchestral music] - Hello? Hello? Is anybody here? We need help. I got us some more firewood. It's not much, I'm gonna have to get more soon, but, ah, this will last for a little while. - I'm so tired. - I know you are, honey. Why don't you close your eyes and rest now that I'm back. Everything's alright. We're gonna be okay. - Are we? - Yes, somebody had to have seen the plane go down. The airport knows we didn't land. They've probably already sent a search party out, okay? That's why I had to get us back close to the crash site. - That's not what I mean. - Just one thing at a time, okay? - And then what? We just move forward with the old plan? Just pretend that nothing happened? - We promised we weren't gonna talk about this until after we get back. - After we get back from our big save our marriage retreat. Take a look around, Richard. There's not gonna be some big private retreat to save us. There may not be a tomorrow. - Don't talk like that. We're not gonna die out here, not like that. - We were never guaranteed growing old and gray together. - We just gotta get outta here, okay? Please, let's just focus on that. - We need to talk about this right now. - Now? - This is the perfect time. Richard, if I die out here tonight like this, I know where I'm going, but what scares me is if you die out here, I know where you're going. - The whole Heaven and Hell thing, Rachel, really? Just no, stop it. - We've got to talk about this Rich. - I'm gonna go get us some more firewood. [atmospheric piano music] You can have the house if you want it. I don't wanna make a big deal out of this with lawyers and everything. Let's just get this done and over with. [dramatic electronic music] Great timing again, Rachel. [screaming] Some mountain retreat. [atmospheric electronic music] [atmospheric piano music] Richard, I will sign these if it's what you want. - [Rachel And Richard] I don't want the house or the cars or any of it. - [Rachel] All I ask for is a weekend for both of us to think this over, but not a weekend at home, Rachel. - We've been praying that you and your spouse will be rejuvenated and re-energized during this special retreat. A beautiful mountain getaway to rekindle your romance. [sighing] Great. This is what you wanted? This is supposed to save our marriage? Is it even worth saving? What am I doing? I'm talking to nobody. [breathing heavily] [atmospheric piano music] [crickets chirping] - You know I know, right? - I know. [fire crackling] [atmospheric orchestral music] [birds chirping] [Richard sighing] Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Come on. [fingers tapping on phone] Come on. Come on, work for me. Come on. God. [grunting] [ominous electronic music] Give me something. - Just give me something to say. [atmospheric piano music] Something I can do to get through. God, I don't know what else I can do at this point. God, help him say yes to this trip. Help me save my marriage, please, God. Help me save my marriage. [dramatic electronic music] [water dripping] [Richard groaning] [breathing heavily] [groaning] Are you kidding me? Baby, I know you're cold. I found this. Here, is that better? [groaning] - I found it in your sock drawer. - Rachel-- - It's, it's alright. You had already filed. It was just the next step. - It's not like that. Rachel, before we fell asleep, you said that you-- - I knew. - I need you to know that, um-- - It's Kristen, right? - [Richard] How did you know? - [Rachel] I don't sleep as soundly as you think I do. - Rachel. - Just, why? Why would you do it? We stood in front of all our family, friends, we stood in front of God and, and we promised to honor each other in sickness and in health, in good times and bad. Do you remember? - I remember. - Then why? - Rachel, I tried to help you. I did. And nothing I tried was working. I got confused, and I felt like I lost you the same day we lost Evan. And when you finally started getting better, it had nothing to do with me. I couldn't even be a part of it because, because you had shut me out, and, ah, it was like all you had room for was God, and all that stuff that your sister was talking about. - So you were jealous of my relationship with God? - No. I felt like you had abandoned me. - I abandoned you? All those times I was home hurting and crying, you were off on business trips. - I tried. Rachel, I tried, I did. I didn't just give up on you. - So you decided to hurt me instead? - Oh, I never meant to hurt you. I just, I felt numb. I needed to feel something more than just pain, and I needed someone who could make me feel-- - Do you love her? - No, I don't. I don't love her. - [Rachel] I'm sorry. [crying] - [Richard] What? - [crying] I'm so sorry, Richard. I was hurting so much. I just shut you out. I shut everybody out. By the time I was ready to open that door again, you weren't waiting for me. [sighing] But do you know who was? - Don't, don't go there. - God was. He was waiting for me like he's been waiting for me my whole life. Rich, when I finally let him in it was like, it was like this warm blanket just covered me, and I had such a peace and I want that for you too. - You're not the one who should be apologizing. I... Rachel, I was confused, I didn't know what to do, and I got stupid. And I got selfish. My whole life people would come to me for answers. Our whole marriage. You did and you stopped doing that. So I just hid from everything. Rachel, I'm sorry for the man that I became. I need you to forgive me. I know I don't deserve it, [crying] but I need you to forgive me. [crying] - [Rachel] I forgive you. I do, I forgive you. - Oh, baby. Sorry. I'm sorry, baby. - I forgive you for all of it. There's something I've gotta have you do first. I need you to ask God to forgive you. - Rachel, don't. - It took me a long time to be able to forgive you. Well, we're running out of time. I need you to ask him to forgive you. Please. - The fire's dying, I gotta keep you warm. I'm gonna take care of you. [Rachel gasping] I'll be back. [crying] [dramatic electronic music] Really Rachel? - We're going to a marriage camp run by a church. - And that book is to blame. - Something like that. [Richard sighing] Richard, I'm just looking for answers. - Fire and brimstone? Demons, devils? What does that have to do with our marriage? [plane whirring] - I guess we'll find out. - Can you at least have got a later flight? [dramatic electronic music] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] I got you a present. I figured it might help past the time till we get outta here. [lightning striking] Rachel, there's something I need to say. I lied. I was jealous. [atmospheric electronic music] I still am. [atmospheric piano music] Help me understand how I'm supposed to believe in a God that can let stuff like this happen to people like us? We don't even have water anymore. There's fuel leaking from the plane into our only water supply. - I don't have many answers, Rich. I only know when I started surrounding to the idea that God's, was in control of everything, [thunder rumbling] the good and the bad, I started feeling such a peace. [atmospheric electronic music] There's something so beautiful in that. - How? Rachel that makes no sense to me. - I just, I kept reading, and it started to make sense. How much God loves us. He really does. [breathing heavily] I just had to let go. [dramatic orchestral music] - Something made you better, and even if I wasn't a part of it, I'm glad that it worked, baby. - Rich, I don't know how much longer I can hold on. - Rachel, I'm begging you, stop talking like that. We're gonna get outta here. - Richard, you've got stop running. [thunder rumbling] I'm getting worse, but it's okay. Everything changed for me two months ago. [breathing heavily] I tried to tell you. I messed it all up. You got angry and told me to leave you out of it, and... [lightning striking] What if I die? Baby if I die out here, it's okay. - It's not okay with me. [lightning striking] Rachel, I actually feel like we, we can make this work. If you do die out here, I will never forgive your God. [lightning striking] I need to find us some shelter. - You need to find something else. [lightning striking] - Rachel, I've always believed in what I can see. Look around us. All this is just pain. What's left to believe in? - Something more. Something better. - I can't. - Can't or won't? [lightning striking] [plane engine whirring] - [sighing] I have no room. - I know, it's a little tight in here. He said it's only going to be for a couple of hours. Don't worry, it's gonna be fun. - Huh, yeah. Fun, if you consider getting beat over the head by a Bible fun. - Yeah, it's not gonna be like that. - How do you know that Rachel? How do you know this is not gonna be some kind of a cult? - It's not a cult. - How do you know? There's gonna be some old, white guy with a beard singing Kumbaya and smoking a peace pipe, talking about peace and love. - It's not 1965 Richard. Give it a chance. - I'll give it a chance. - Yeah. Richard, honestly, it's gonna be good for us. It'll give us some time away. You know, without the distractions of home, work. It might really do us some good. - What his name? - Hey, Darren, how much longer before. - What was that? [breathing heavily] - It's just some rough air. - Darren, hey. How much longer before we. [dramatic electronic music] - Oh, Richard. - Hold on! [lightning striking] She asked you to help her. She called out to you for help, and you let this happen? [thunder rumbling] [lightning striking] - [breathing heavily] Oh, God. I'm so ready for the pain to be over. [atmospheric piano music] I just wanna go home. I just wanna go home. Please help Rich. Please help Rich. - Rachel this is not gonna work. Too many fumes in the plane, and the storm's gonna be big. I found a cave earlier. It's further away, but we're gonna have to get you there instead. [dramatic orchestral music] - Rich, I can't. [thunder rumbling] - What can I do? Can I make you more comfortable? - Can you hold me? Just hold me. [lightning striking] Will you read this to me? Read to me? Read to me? - Let not your heart be troubled. [atmospheric piano music] Believe in God, believe also in me. In my father's house there are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto myself. The way I am ye may be also. [atmospheric piano music] It worked, baby. Your trip worked. I know now I cannot live without you. I didn't know how to say goodbye to Evan. Now how am I gonna say goodbye to you? I've loved you since I was 14 years old. So many things I'm gonna miss about you, baby. The way you smile when you catch me looking at you. The way you sing and dance with the radio. I'm gonna miss talking about building a family together. - I miss Evan. [atmospheric orchestral music] - I wanted a little boy. [dramatic orchestral music] I wanted to coach him in baseball. I'm sorry I didn't talk more about it after we lost him, baby. I just, I just didn't think it would help. Please, please, don't think I didn't love him because I did. I do. - I love you. - I love you. - I see Evan. - Rachel, no. Don't you leave me. Don't you leave me. Baby, don't. I don't wanna live without you. Baby, please. [crying] Baby. I'm gonna make you comfortable. No. No, baby. I'm sorry. Why? [crying] What kind of a God are you? I hate you! I hate you! You hear me? She said she loved you, and this is what you do? And this is how you treat her? [crying] [dramatic orchestral music] [screaming] [fuel exploding] [electronic ringing] [Richard crying] [fire roaring] [Richard crying] [fire roaring] [fire roaring] Damn you! [plane exploding] [lightning cracking] [rain pattering] [wind howling] [thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] I'll come back for you. I promise.

You're seeing me this way because in your heart you know where I am. - What does that mean? - It means you believe. I'm not here in this cave with you, but I'm inside your heart, and you're seeing me the way that you'd imagine I am right now. It means you believe. - Rachel? Rachel?

I, I need you in my live. [crying] I wanna see Rachel again. And I wanna see Evan. [crying] And, and I wanna see you. [crying] [upbeat rock music] [siren wailing] [helicopter whirring] [sirens wailing] - We found the plane. [atmospheric electronic music] - [Richard] God has a way of waking us up. Of opening our eyes. Sometimes he does it subtly, sometimes it's more dramatic. What happened out there changed my life forever. Rachel dying on impact, but coming to me when I needed her the most. I don't have her anymore, and I never got to hold my son, but now thanks to Rachel, I know I'm gonna see her again. I know that I'm finally gonna be able to hold Evan and to see his face. It's not because I was able to survive the crash or the storm or my own anger and hatred, it's because Jesus saved me, and he didn't just save me from the situation, he saved me from me. Life can get turbulent, but you can make it through. That's what Rachel taught me, and that's what God gave me, and I owe them both my life.
