Jimmy. Mary. - Now, Jimmy. No. Jimmy. What's the matter with you? Matter? We are at a crowded reception. Ah, those monkeys aren't going to come in here. If they were alive they would not listen to that music. Don't be vulgar. - Vulgar? What's the idea of those cheaters? What has happened to you? Happened? What do you mean? When I left town just over a month ago .. Not only was your eyesight perfect but you were my pal. My wonderful Minnie. So now you are finding out I'm not so wonderful? No, Minnie, I don't .. - I wish you'd stop calling me Minnie. It's the Minnies who have all the fun. Jimmy. Now, come on. Give me my glasses. I got a surprise for your, darling. - A surprise? Yeah. Want to hear it? Yes. Yes. Of course. Well, that series of conferences I had with the boss out on the coast. Led to something I've been angling for for a long time. A five-year contract. Which means you're looking at a pretty stable citizen. The kind of a guy who could get married. Why, Jimmy. - Yep. So, that being the case. What about it, babe? Jimmy, there is something we have got to have out. I am .. I am not sure this is the place nor the time, but .. While you were away, I .. Found out that .. - That what? I found that our relationship is trivial. Now, let's face it. You think we have too much fun? That isn't it, darling. But .. It is all such nonsense. Such .. Adult, infant .. Infantilism. Uhoh. Them is might fancy words, Minnie my girl. Look, darling. I am asking you to marry me. To be the mother of my children. By the way, I want six of them. And on my salary as a journalist that's no nonsense. Oh, Jimmy. You couldn't settle down with a family. And you know it better than I do. Who wants to settle down? Our kids will be gadabouts. No, darling. It is no good. Why not? - Well .. Oh. We have to go in there now. Come on, now. Give me my glasses, Jimmy. What do I get in return? - Oh no. What do I get in return? - No, Jimmy. No, no. Jimmy. Well, for mercy's sake. So this is where you were hiding. - Why didn't you knock? In my own house? - The true essence of hospitality. The true essence of hospitality is for a hostess to produce her special guest. Darling, I am sorry. Really I am. Alright. Walter, go and tell them we found her. But I haven't met .. - Run along. Run along, Walter. Jimmy, may I please have my glasses? Just as I thought. Nothing but plain, pure window glass. Come along, Mary. What happened to her Bridget since I was away? I haven't seen much of Mary. Oh. That is suspicious, isn't it. Mary. What have you been up to? Oh, here you are. I would know you anywhere, Miss Howard. Homer. Come here. Yes. Here she is. The world's greatest female lady authoress. You mustn't mind me. I was rousing her. This is indeed a pleasure. A very great pleasure. Thank you. We count on your books Miss Howard .. As a real means of escape from this sordid and matter-of-fact world of ours. Thank you so much. You know, I do try to make them just that. And this is Jimmy Lee. Do you blame her for hiding out? Thank you. You see, I have a fan too. Now, we mustn't keep the others waiting for Miss Howard. There are more inside just like these. - What? I mean admirers, Mary. I do hope you won't be bored, Jimmy. Bored? Why, literary receptions are my very life's blood. Isn't she beautiful. Just like one of her own heroines. It was wonderful. Yasha, the sonata was divine. - Thank you, angel. Hello. How are you? Nice to see you. Miss Howard. I brought your last book. Can you autograph it for me? I would be delighted. - Would you make it sort-of intimate? With all best wishes to 'my friend'. I'll not only write it, I'll mean it. You are wonderful. - Have you a pen? I think there is one in the library. - Alright. Phew. Bridgy. How long will this go on? Now, if you don't like it Jimmy, why did you come? It's the first chance to see her since I got back. You know me. I'd follow her nibs into a blast furnace. Now, don't be disrespectful. I haven't met Mr Lee yet. Haven't you? This is Walter Del Canto. - How do you do. Walter is my decorator. He is doing me over. I mean he's doing over my place in the country. What is it, Matthews? - Supper is served, madam. Come along everyone. Supper is served. Walter, tell everyone supper is served. Come on, Jimmy. Supper. Everyone. Excuse me a minute, Jimmy. There you are. - Thanks, Miss Howard. I thank you. Say, Mary. - Darling, just a minute. I feel we bore you terribly, Miss Howard. Bore me? It's a great privilege. Thank you so much. - Thank you. Do you mind? For my son. He couldn't come. He has the flu. What is his name? - It is Fred. But I believe if you were to write .. 'To Freddie' he might get well. To Freddie. I hope he'll be well soon. Thank you very much, Miss Howard. - Thank you. Miss Howard would you mind terribly autographing .. I would love to .. With some personal sentiment. Why not? Darling, why did it have to come to this? We are such friends. - We were never friends. I was so nuts about you I'd have proposed the first time I ever met you. If I'd have had anything to offer. I haven't much even now. But it is a start. Oh Mary, we have been so darned happy bouncing around together. Think what fun it would be for keeps. How about taking a powder and looking in on The Colonnade? Sorry. I can't. They got a new dance band there that's terrific. But I have to work. Work? At this hour? Yes. I love it. Look, honey. Someday you'll go sailing off in a pink balloon and bump smack into Pike's Peak. What you need is a steady, practical, everyday guy like me. Who makes sure to see you knock off work in the afternoon when the whistle blows. A steady, practical guy? Do you think that description fits you? What if you gave it a chance? Darling, I have grown to be an obsession with you. That is all. What you need is some awfully nice girl to play about with. You can go to nightclubs and have loads of laughs. And take it all in your stride. She'll come along someday. If a girl says that, it means she's got her eyes on another guy. Hello Woodruf. - I'm so glad to see you. So that is who you are out to impress, huh? Impress? - With the cheaters. Mary. Hello. Sorry to be so late, Mary. - That's alright, Rogers. Jimmy, this is my publisher, Mr Woodruf. Mr Lee. How do you do. - And Bridget. I see you have already met. - Oh yes. Now, where was it? Oh, somebody's houseboat or swimming pool. Anyway, I had the impression it was very wet. Mr Del Canto - Mr Woodruff. Oh Mary, you do get all the attractive ones. What I mean is .. What I mean, Walter, is .. Oh, Mrs Prendergast. Mr Woodruf, I do want you to meet Mrs Prendergast. Really? Thank you. Your publisher? - Yes. Since when? But you were with McGowan and Company. No. I left them weeks ago. Didn't I tell you? No. You didn't tell me. Thank you so much, Mr Woodruf. - That was so nice of you. Now sit down. I'll see you get something to eat and drink. No, please. I don't .. - No trouble at all. Come along, Walter. The reason I'm late is your book. I only got the typescript this afternoon. Tell me the worst. The worst I can say is .. It is your best. Oh Rogers, you mean it? - It is superb. There is only one revision I would suggest. The last chapter. Oh, really? That needs some working on. I didn't know you had finished your book. Yes. About three weeks ago. Didn't I write you? - No. You didn't write me. Then I'll have a script sent to your office the first thing in the morning. Here we are. Serve Mr Woodruf. No. No thank you very much. Mary. Sorry to rush you. But I would like to talk about that last chapter while it's fresh in my mind. Of course. Do forgive me, Bridgy. But you know I did explain to you that I have to work. Of course, dear. I understand. If you must. Shall we go to your office? I have the script in my car. I thought we might go to The Colonnade. I've reserved a nice, quiet table there. Going to a nightclub to write a last chapter? Or to begin a first one. Jimmy, that is so clever. Walter, why don't you say bright things like that? I mean you are clever too, only not so amusing. What I mean is .. Never mind darling. Goodnight. - Goodnight, dear. Thank you for a lovely party. I'll go to the door with you. - Goodnight, Jimmy. Let me know the minute you've read the script and we'll discuss it. It's been nice meeting you, Mr Grant. The name is Lee. I am so sorry. A natural association. Grant and Lee. I always think of them together. Yes, that's right. Only that Lee surrendered. Yes. Do you ever give them vitamin B? Hello there. If they got tired, nervous or depressed give them three shots of vitamin B .. And they'll leap out of bed and take on the heavyweight champion. Can I come in? No. Why not? Not after standing me up three times in a row. You are dead wrong. I was there every time. You lie like a Trojan. It's troopers that lie. Trojans work. I've done that. I've done my time looking over your wall. You are crazy. I've been here every day. Oh yeah? Tuesday afternoon 4:30. Up on the balcony with Woodruf. Wednesday. Twenty minutes to five. On the balcony with Woodruf. Yesterday at 5:30. Up on the balcony. With Woodruf. Woodruf is my publisher. He keeps his printing presses up there? - He's helping me revise my book. That last chapter, huh? Yes. It was more of a job than I thought. Did you read it, Jimmy? - Every word. I'm dying to know what you think of it. - Yeah? Snail poison. When I was a kid in the country we used stuff like this to kill Woodrufs. I mean woodchucks. By the way, Woodruf is married, isn't he? Rogers? - I believe that's his name. Rogers. Not Clarence or Jake. But Rogers. Is there a missus? Why .. Yes. I suppose so. I am sure there is. You ever met her? No. Why? I just wondered. What's all this got to do with my book? He says this is your best, huh? Yes. No reason a big publisher like that should kid you, is there? No. Of course not. - Of course not. And the answer is he doesn't know his business because this, in my opinion .. Is from Dixie. Jimmy. You don't really think that? No. I don't mean to hurt you, Mary. Aside from being crazy for you, I am pretty darned proud of your work. I sure hate to see you slip like that. But after all, a lot of other people have liked it. Yours is only one opinion. And you used to be considered pretty sound. Your first stuff was as real as .. As that crooked tree. It was alive because it was about something you knew something about. But this stuff, Mary. It's artificial. It's put together like a jigsaw puzzle. You people never come to life. They are not even human. Neither fish nor flesh. Just foul. Louder, Jimmy. They can't hear you across the river. You'll admit your men never were too convincing. I this case, you don't even know your women. I don't know women. I don't know women? Just what I said. You start by making your heroine a straightforward, square-shooting gal. Then let her take a man from his wife. - But don't you see? The wife was already done with him. - So you say. I wrote the book, didn't I? Just what I am trying to say. Minnie, these people of yours aren't alive. They're trumped up. It's pretty obvious you don't know very much about women. Oh, yes I do. All kinds. Good and bad. Straight and loose. The worst kind is the one that pretends to be on the level but isn't. Women are like eggs, my darling. When they're good they're good. When they're not .. phooey. I'll thank you to keep your vulgar similes out of this. 'Vulgar'. There is that word again. Well, listen. If I am vulgar, what about that girl of yours? She's such a dirty little double-crosser .. The guys will be fed up with her in a few months and hit her in the mouth. Yes. He might. If you were they guy. Jimmy. You see, I am not writing about guys like you. My characters are people who have to wrestle seriously with ethical problems. Moral problems. - Oh, Mary. They may be introverts. And as such, they may bore and annoy guys like you but that's what they are. You'd do what the girl in the book does? - Ridiculous. Would you? - We're talking about a book. You may be, Minnie. But I am not. And I am asking you. Would you do that the female heel of yours does? Would you greatly mind getting out of here? Uhuh. Shall I call the police? Can I be of any help, old man? Hello Bridget. Hello Walter. Jimmy, I am sorry. Come on upstairs. Your front door was open so we barged right in. Why not? Walter. Be amusing. Like Jimmy. Jimmy. Now try and be nice like Walter. Hello, darling. Hello, Mary dear. How are you, Walter? - Hello, Jimmy. Well, was it a fight? Of course not. Not a fight at all. It was just a literary discussion. - Oh. I bet you two can't guess what we've been doing. You and Walter? - Uhuh. I thought that's what we weren't meant to guess. I don't see why you say that. Oh .. We went to Greenwich Village to look at some pictures. And I said to Walter, as we've come this far, we might as well go the whole way. Tut-tut. You said that to Walter? To the picture you idiot. - Oh. When is your book coming out, Marry? - In a couple of months. What is it about? It's about a girl. Noble, fine, high principled. Who is in love with a married man. A great love. The real thing. He goes for her like a steamroller. Does she try to back away from him? Not in the least. She goes for him hook, line and sinker. And how does it end? - She sinks. I am working on the ending now. I am crazy to read it, Mary. I usually don't like your .. Darling. Oh my, isn't it hot? Jimmy, would I stick to that chair? It depends on how sticky you are. You say the cleverest things. Walter, why don't you .. Why don't you sit down, Walter. Oh my. Isn't it awful? The heat. Thank goodness I am moving out to the country for good tomorrow. Oh, Mary. I wish you'd come out Friday night instead of Saturday. I can't wait to show you what Walter has done to the old place. Going to Bridget's for the weekend? - Yep, To work. Speaking of work. Doctors say I must spend 5 days in the country or they won't be responsible. Bridget, would you like some tea? - Tea? I would not. I'm not as old as all that. Alright then, a cocktail. - That's more like it. Jimmy, be a darling and make some. It's Anna's day off. I must tell you. I had lunch with Dora Mills yesterday. I'll bet it's true. - What's true? About her and Phil Corsey. I never believed it before actually. I do now. Why now? Does she look guilty? - Cocktails, Jimmy. I don't want to leave now. You fix them. You and Walter can both go. Now go on. We want to talk. We men never get in on anything. Come on, Walter. Jimmy is so amusing. You want me to ask him up this weekend? - Why Jimmy? I can see him any time. Well, who then? Anyone you like. Of course. I have to rewrite my last chapter and I could do it at your place if .. If what? If you would ask Mr Woodruf. I would love to have him up dear but I have never met his wife. I sort-of hate inviting people I don't know. Do you know her? No. No, but .. This isn't a social engagement, Bridgy. It's business and there is no need to ask her. You mean, ask him without his wife? - Business, Bridgy. Do you understand? No. I don't. Oh. Yes, yes, yes. I do. Darling, do you like this hat? Oh, just the thing for a glamour girl. Walter says it gives me a touch of the gamin. Darling, look. I am Bridgy, your old friend. Come on. Give. What are you talking about? - Business. Your suspicions, Bridgy, are out of order. Mr Woodruf is a married man. But of course. The good ones always are. Somebody has always beaten you to it. I am afraid springtime and that hat are giving you ideas. But darling, I haven't any ideas. I was merely saying he is a terribly attractive man who .. Seems to drop in here terribly often and .. Life is flying by so terribly fast and after all .. why not? Oh, Bridgy. This is an awfully hard age for us women. That is if you care for the real thing. I've never been content with imitations. Yet here we are surrounded by them on all sides. Nothing lasting. Nothing real. Nothing fine. Practically nothing at all. And when it comes to love. What is that nowadays? Something to while away hours in nightclubs .. Along with Highballs and the boogie-woogie. Oh, darling. It isn't all like that. No. No. But when it isn't, what then? Suppose the great thing does happen to come along. The thing that even transfuses the ugliness and .. And somehow makes it lovely and poetic. And suppose that thing is forbidden. What then? Yes. What indeed? I wonder what she is like. His wife, I mean. They say she is an awful droop. Droop? Who says so? - I have heard tell. An intellectual droop. You know, just the sort of a woman you'd expect a publisher's wife to be. What does he say about her? He doesn't talk about her. He's gallant. Maybe he is ashamed. Ashamed of what? I don't know. The way he treats her or something. Oh, no. I've never known him to do or say anything that wasn't fine. Darling. Maybe you are making a mistake. A mistake? A gallant man who is stuck with an intellectual droop. Well, life certainly owes him .. something. [ Doorbell ] Maybe that is Rogers. Bridget. There is no need to tell Jimmy you are asking Mr Woodruf down for the weekend. No. What? Oh. Mary. Hello, Rogers. Your door was unlocked. Bridget is here with Walter. Oh? Jimmy is here too. - Oh. Don't look so gloomy. They will be leaving soon. I thought we'd have dinner together. - We are. Bridgy. Bridgy. Here is Mr Woodruf. - Mrs Drake. Mr Woodruf. Why, you are just about the last person on earth I expected to see. I hope you're as glad to see me as I am to see you. Just about. I expect. Well. Don't go out of your way. I only came to show Mary a new jacket. What? She disliked the last one I had made up for her. Well. I suppose, when a man buys a girl a jacket it does mean .. business. He means the jacket to my book, dear. The cover. The cover, is it? - Yes. Oh, I thought he meant .. It's the weather. Bridget is allergic to the heat. That is why she is so anxious to get up to the country. Aren't you, darling? I can't wait to see your new house in the country. Of course. By the way, Mr Woodruf. Mary is coming up top my little place for the weekend and .. Yes. If you're about to ask me, please go right ahead. How sweet of you to accept. Well, here we are. Cocktails. Hello, Woodruf. I am sorry my hands are full. Hello. - Hello. Walter, we mustn't stay long. Mr Woodruf and Mary want to talk about her wrapper. I mean, her book. And we have so many things to collect for the weekend. Thank goodness I will soon be out of this beastly, hot, dirty town. Oh, for the peace and purity and quiet of the country. To the peace and purity and coolness of the country. Here's hoping I don't collapse here in this hot sticky town. Of course, Jimmy. I was planning to invite you out too. Sometime. So Mary isn't going out this weekend? Yes. But you see, Mary isn't a guest. She is just a friend. So she doesn't have to be comfy. And anyway, she will be busy with her last chapter. I suppose, Mr Woodruf, you think Mary's book is terribly clever. Don't you? - It's better than that. I hope it sells as well as well as Wildcats. Walter, who wrote Wildcats? Timothy Bix. I adore Bix. You and five million others, Mrs Drake. Now that is my kind of a novel. But of course, I am still romantic. About everything but me. - Shush, Walter. We are being literary. I don't suppose Woodruf that you would stoop to publish Timothy Bix? Stoop? I should say I would. Would you, Rogers? I'm afraid so. Unfortunately I have stockholders to satisfy. I doubt if he'd change publishers though. He may change if you gave him what he wanted. No harm in trying. Besides, you have a very persuasive way authors. Do you know Bix? Do I know Bix? Where could I reach him? Let me see now. He is leaving for the coast on Sunday. I might fix up a luncheon for Saturday. But Saturday is .. is .. It is the end of the week. Oh dear. It is hot. I mean .. What time is it? 6:30, more or less. 6:30? Oh, Mary. Walter, did you hear? It is 6:30. Jimmy, you will have to give us a lift up down. I mean, will you? The taxi fares these days are so exorbitant .. I feel as though I were paying my income tax all over again. You'll give us a lift? No need to work so hard, Bridgy. I catch on. Can I give you a lift, Woodruf? Thanks. But I have to see Mary about .. - I know. About her kimono. Goodbye, dear. - Goodbye. Mr Woodruf. I will see you .. When I see you. Come along, Walter. So long, Mary. - Goodbye. Mr Woodruf. - Bye. Coming, Jimmy? I'm sorry I can't take you for a ride, Woodruf. Don't forget Bix. No. I'll try to reach him tomorrow. So long, Mary. I'll walk to the door with you. Be back in a moment. You sore at me? For the way I talked about your book? No, no. I am not angry at all. I do think however that you are wasting your talents. You ought to make your editor let you do the book reviews. Sarcasm, huh? I don't suppose you're ever sarcastic to me, are you dear. Oh, stop being an authoress and have dinner with me. I am sorry, Jimmy. Not tonight. I get it. As a matter of fact I've a dinner date at the Guinnesses. Mabel called this afternoon. Needs an extra man. Jimmy. We are waiting. - Coming, Bridgy. Goodbye, Jimmy. - I will see you. When I see you. - Okay. Goodbye, Mary. - Bye, Bridgy. Goodbye. - Bye, Walter. I'd better fix your door so that the rest of the wolves can't get in. Rogers. Yes? Are you publishing my book for the stockholders? Yes. You see, I am trying to improve their taste. Sweet. There is something I want to ask you. Do you think my heroine is .. obvious .. And vulgar? Vulgar? What in the world gave you an idea like that? Oh. Something Jimmy said. You mean Jimmy Lee? Yes. He has been fairly sound in the past as a critic, you know. Rogers, I do so want this story to be about an exceptional woman. I want her instincts to be fine. But they are fine, my dear. Then why can't she do what I have her do now? Why couldn't she go to the wife without subterfuge or hypocrisy to say simply .. I love your husband. Darling, that seems to me to be the only honest way to meet the problem. But that's exactly why your book fails in its purpose, Mary. That scene. In real life, if those two women met .. They would make a mess of everything. Maybe I could write it more simply. After all, Rogers. They are two modern, intelligent women. Surely, they could talk things over sanely and come to an understanding. At this moment I wish you had never written a book. I've had a grilling day, Mary. I have looked forward so much to this. How selfish of me. I am sorry. Come on. We'll forget all about the book. Would you like another cocktail? - Yes, please. Lovely, isn't it. Twilight. Your garden. The river. All we need is a moon. Or would a moon be too obvious? Beauty has a habit of being obvious. You never .. Thank you. Thank you. Well. Where shall we have dinner? Couldn't we stay here and eat the flowers or something? I hate leaving all this. You poor darling. Then we shan't leave it. We'll have dinner here and I will be the cook. Don't tell me you can cook. Well, a little. A steak and a salad. Now I know that I am dreaming. We both are. Look. Entering just on cue: the moon. It is perfect. Well, I'll wake up just long enough to cook the steak and change for dinner. Excuse me. Long experience as a single, unattached extra man has proven to me .. That a New York hostess giving a dinner party has no scruples and no honor. Meaning who, Jimmy? - Certainly not you, Mabel. No. She calls you up at five o'clock and she says 'be an angel and help me out'. 'Cousin Lottie is here from Kirkuk'. 'You'll be crazy about Lottie. She is a darling'. The darling usually turns out to be six feet tall. She'd have worn braces on her teeth when she was a kid. But didn't. But she did get vaccinated though because there it is. Staring at you all through dinner. Excuse me. - Enter Lottie. Darling. I'm so glad to see you. - You'll never guess why I am late. I played hooky and drove over to the yacht club. Sailing? - All afternoon. It was glorious. It made a new man of me. This is Jimmy Lee. - How do you do? Cousin Lottie. Just arrived from Kirkuk by sailboat. Lottie dear, show the gentleman your vaccination. Why, certainly. Is it only Mabel or are you crazy too? Well, if you like them crazy then that's what I am. That's very charming of you. - Come along, Lottie. Oh, excuse me. Have a drink, dear? - Thanks. The same. Was today the first sail of the season? - Uhuh. How did you find the Jolly Roger? - Leaking. A foot of water in the bilge. I had to bail it out. You bailed a boat with those fair hands? And a bucket. - What boat do you sail? A skimmer. - How high is your boom? You mean the main mast, don't you? Jimmy wouldn't know the difference. - Is that so? I wanted to find out how much Lottie knew about sailing. Are you a sailor, Mr Lee? - Ha .. am I a sailor? I cut my teeth on a lifebuoy. - I like Mr Lee. 'Jimmy' to you, Lottie. 'Clare' to you. Jimmy. That is a lovely name, Clare. Clare what or am I being too personal? Woodruf. When I was a kid I used to spend my summers in Nantucket and that's where .. Did you say Woodruf? - Hmm. Why? Was it wrong of me to tell you? You couldn't by any chance be Mrs Rogers Woodruf? Not only could be. I am. Do you know my husband? I have met him, yeah. Oh. Poor Rogers, he's so disappointed about tonight. He was looking forward to this dinner. Then at noon, one of his authors called in from the country wanting help. Rogers had to go. What kind of help? The story has gone dead or the author is having trouble with his wife or .. Planning to commit suicide. You know what authors are like. Yes. And do I. You see, Rogers is not only their publisher. He tries to be their friend. That's awfully nice of him but kinda hard on you, isn't it? I don't mind. It is like being married to a doctor. Hi, sailors. Dinner is ready. Aye-aye, sir. It is interesting you know. Meeting someone with whom you have so much in common. Oh? Oh, boats? Yeah. Boats. Well, shall we go in? Thank you, Mary. For what, the steak? For the prefect end of a hectic day. I thank you. There is a jewel which no Indian mines can buy. No chymic art can counterfeit. Makes men rich in greatest poverty. Makes water wine. Turns wooden cups to gold. That is a very obscure poem. How do you happen to know it? I don't know, Rogers. I just do. I think I must have learned it long ago just to keep you company at this moment. How wonderful it would be if there were only some means of holding this moment. Of protecting it forever. - We will protect it. In our memories. Will tomorrow be tiresome for you too? I am afraid so. After all, today I had your book to read. Between interruptions. It was a little bit like being with you. Well, my heroine's problem is much easier than mine. You see she knows exactly what sort of woman the wife is. Why not? I invented both of them. What is that to do with us? I don't know your wife, Rogers. I don't know what resources she may have. I don't know how vitally I may be hurting her. I tell you that has nothing to do with us. I love you, Mary. Rogers, I keep putting myself in her place. And if it weren't for me, I .. It's such a heart-breaking business. By the way, I am going down to Bridget's on Friday. I think it's better if you come down on Saturday instead of driving with me. By that time, I'll have something done for you to criticise. Thank you for putting that black line around the jacket. I think it has a lot more style. Don't you? Mary. Please say goodnight now, Rogers. Alright, my dear. And forget about the last chapter for a little while. When the inspiration does strike .. You are going to find it will write itself. If the inspiration strikes. It will. There's some great writing in this chapter. Deep feeling too. You mean, where the girl first realizes she is in love? How did you know I meant that bit? I like it too. Telepathy. I always know when I'm really hitting the truth, Rogers. It does something rather funny to me. It makes my heart sort-of flutter. - Does it? That is extraordinary. It is exactly the way I can tell when something is good. The best bit of writing is what follows. - Yes. I know. Where she confesses her love for him. That is it. Oh, she is glorious. With all the obstacles in her way, a coward in nature might have held back. But not she. No doubts or fears. No running away. No schoolgirls talk of 'let's be friends'. Only the fearless acceptance of the situation. Because she is a sensitive woman. And she knows by instinct that a love like this .. Is the whole meaning of life. Had I told you that is my favorite melody? Why no, darling. Then how did you know? Telepathy. Was I playing it so badly, Rogers? Mary. Am I to go all through life .. alone? Oh, darling. Mary. Are you still up? No. Let me. Jimmy. This is the first time I've climbed up a balcony. Jimmy! There goes my garter. I'll bet Romeo didn't wear garters. Jimmy. Hiya, Minn. Jimmy, you are tight. So am I. - Then go on home. It is terribly late. Hello Minn. I said hello. How are you? I am fine. Oh, a party? Informal too. Well, well, well. I've been to a party myself. Formal mind. Very formal. The Guinnesses. Will you please go home. That's exactly what I'm doing. Going home. See, I was walking round the block and saw the light in the window. And I knew it was shining for me. So I said to myself, Mary won't mind if I take a shortcut so .. I climbed over the wall, through the garden, up the tree .. And now I'm going right straight .. Well hello, Mr Woodruf. I didn't know you were here. Yet. I hope I'm not butting in. Mr Woodruf and I were working on my book. You're likely to wreck you eyesight working in the dim lighting, Mr Woodruf. We'll soon fix that. There. Better? Well. Who wants a drink? Personally, I don't need one. Really I don't. Have you got a cigarette, Woodruf? Yes. Here. What a lovely cigarette case. Just like the one Mary gave me once. I guess I had better be running along. And let you discuss your book or whatever you were discussing. It is getting kinda late. Oh. It's getting very late. Boy-o-boy-o-boy. What a party. By the way, Woodruf. I met your wife tonight. She is a very charming woman. I had never met her before. I said I met your wife tonight. She is a very charming woman. Ain't it funny the unexpected way you bump into people. Your wife is very fond of sailing. Knows all about handling a boat. Is she as good a sailor as she says? Yes, she is quite an expert. - Yeah. She invited me to go sailing with her. I hope you don't mind. Not at all. Goodnight, Mary. Wait. Jimmy. Mr Woodruf will drive you home. That is might nice of him. Mighty nice. Now it's his turn to take me for a ride. I hope for your sake you don't recall the exhibition you've made of yourself. Don't get exasperated, Mary. - I am not exasperated. I'm angry. Really angry. - I'm awfully sorry, Mary. Never mind the apologies. Just get out of here. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. But you get your beauty sleep. Don't you work too hard. Oh boy, oh Boy, oh boy. I wouldn't bust up an affair like that for all the rice in China. Goodnight, Mary. Goodnight. Goodnight, Mary. Goodnight, Jimmy. [ Banging noises ] Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy. The shortcut seems a trifle bumpy. Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. That is a pretty fancy outfit you've got there, sailor. Let me see. What kind of a boat was it you said you sailed? Me? A schooner. Well, blow me down. After that grandeur sailing a tiny sloop like this must be a comedown for you. Not at all. Not at all. Why, when I'm on the water nothing is a comedown. What happened, Jimmy? I was attracted by the view on this side. Lovely marine view. Well, get back to windward before we capsize. I say, skipper. Look ahoy. Ahoy? I mean a-high ahoy .. Way up there. Way up high. Do you like the look of yon clouds? It does look like rain. Better reach down there and break open a couple of slickers. What's that? Break open a couple of slickers. - Huh? Raincoats. Huh? - Right there. Right down there. Alright, I will get the slickers. Here, sailor. You take the tiller. Got it? - Yep. Jimmy. Hold her aft. Hold her aft, Jimmy. Get up there. - Huh? You ready? Slack off the jib sheet. - What? The jib sheet. Right there. Never mind. I'll do it. You take the tiller. What, again? Jimmy. Hang on. I try to will bring her round. - I'm hanging. Hold on. I will get you out. Are you alright? - Yeah. I'm alright. Yoo-hoo, Mary. Look who is here. Just arrived. - Hello, Mary. Hello, Rogers. She is having such a good time up here. Ichabod. - Yes, ma'am? You can turn off the waterwheel now. There is plenty of water in the pool. - Yes, ma'am. I have a surprise for you, Rogers. Wait until you hear. Never mind Mary. You will have plenty of time for your last chapter. Come along. I must show you the place. - It's very beautiful. I wanted to do it colonial but Walter said no. Everybody who owns a farm in Connecticut is colonial. You're going to remain just the way you are. A picturesque old mill. Plus all the modern conveniences. Here we go. Be careful! Look at that. Isn't she wonderful. Mary, you are marvelous. Bridget. Oh dear, Walter is having more trouble with Pierre. Excuse me. Coming. Help a lady out, will you. Thank you. - What is the surprise? The last chapter. Finished? - All but. Just waiting for your okay. - What gave you the idea, darling? You did. I wasn't here. That's what I mean. Come on. It has been quiet. Deadly quiet. I've had much more time to miss you down here than I had in town .. With all the bustle and noise and interruptions. And how I missed you. Say, this is worth all the sacrifice of coming up late. Go ahead. Well, I have gone over every talk we've had in my mind. Sitting alone in the garden and walking alone at night under the stars. Did I tell you I missed you? Tell me again. - I missed you. Darling. The trouble with the last chapter is that I've been treating it too mentally. You can't solve an emotional problem with the brain. My girl has got to go to the man and say: 'Are you sure this is the real thing'? 'Are you sure it is what we both want'? 'And that there will never be any regrets ever'? 'Because if it is the real thing'. 'Then I am not going to fight it any longer'. 'I am going to face it bravely and take the consequences right on the chin'. Good. But he says to her quite simply. He says: 'You're the only woman in my life and you fill it completely'. And then he takes her hands and kisses them with reverence. Fini. Well, have I got it or have I got it? This time you've got it without any doubt in the world. Put the bag in the car, Cletus. - Thank you, sir. Hello. - Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting, Jimmy. But it takes time for a lady to get her hair dried and done over. How are you feeling? Like a grounded mullet. When do we sail again? - Again? How about next Saturday? - No. I can't. I've another engagement. Well, the Saturday after? - No. That's a newspaper guild meeting. So we'll make it three weeks from today. - That will be fine. No, no. I can't possibly. I am going to a funeral. Jimmy. I haven't laughed. Really laughed, for such a long time. I am beginning to ache. Clare, would you mind waiting in the car for me a minute. I want to use the telephone. - Yes, of course. Hello. Hello. Is this the Rogers Woodruf Rogers Publishing company? Is Mr Woodruf there? Well, do you know where you can get in touch with him? Yes. It is very important. This is Mr Bix speaking. Bix. No. Timothy Bix. The author of Wildcats. That's it. Can you tell Mr Woodruf that I fly to the coast tonight instead of tomorrow. And that I will be at the Waldorf until five o'clock. That is right. Thanks very much. I loved your book, Mr Bix. Mr Bix. I say, Mr Bix. Mr Bix! I am just simply crazy about Wildcats. I'll bet they are crazy about you too. Do you know what I would like? What? To spend the rest of my life in the country. Our life. Our life? I stand corrected. Oh, that's alright. They are not broken. Why do you wear these, sweetheart? Eye strain. Do you want to know the real reason? - Yes. Well, the real reason is that actually I am awfully shy. I use them to hide behind. I thought it was something like that. But you don't have to hide from me, do you. No. Not anymore. You have the most romantic hands in the world. Lovely long, slender fingers. A thoroughbred. What a sweet compliment. I like it. What will the harvest be? What will the harvest be? What will the harvest be? Oh, there you are. There is a long-distance call for you, Rogers. What a bore. - Who could it be? Probably my office. I left this number in case anything important came up. Will you excuse me? You know where the telephone is? - Yes. Thank you. Bridgy. Was it the office? Well, I don't know. It sounded like an office. I mean, it didn't sound like his wife. If that is what you mean. I didn't say who I was. I sounded very impersonal. Like a hotel or something. You needn't worry. Was that thunder? It's the weekend, so of course we can expect it to rain. Don't worry, darling. You are playing much better this spring, Walter. I'm so sorry. I must get back to town. - Oh no, Rogers. I'd like my car if I may, Bridget. - Well, if you must. Sorry you must leave so soon, old man. - So am I. It is Timothy Bix. He is flying out the coast tonight. I mustn't let the stockholders down you know. Oui, madame? Will you get out the car de Monsieur Woodruf? Pardon? The car. The car. Comment? You know. The car. The automobile. The auto of Monsieur Woodruf. Ah, oui. L'auto de Monsieur? - Exactly. Tout de suite. Oui, madame. It's so good of you to let me drop in and out like this. I'll be back bright and early tomorrow. You and I can put in a good day on the book. I'll go down to the end of the road with him. I'll be right back, Bridgy. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye. Bridget. - Huh? I have a hunch he'll be back tonight. Oh dear. I hope not. In case he should, I'm going to move him into one of the rooms over the barn. What are you talking about? It's just as comfortable as the one upstairs and .. Well, I had put him next to Mary. Aha. Now, Walter. Don't be that way. I think it is perfectly awful to think what I think you must be thinking. Why did you invite him at all? My usual mental confusion. I can't imagine how we got off the right road. Where are we now? - I will .. Enquire at this house. Don't be long. - I'll be back in a minute. I am sure I heard a car, Walter. I beg your pardon but could you tell me if this is the road to .. Well, Bridgy. How did you get here? How did I get here? I live here. For heaven's sakes, it's Jimmy. - Hello, Walter. You live here? You're not kidding are you? I wish I were. - How did you get here? Well, I thought I was taking a shortcut and .. And you got lost. Right outside my house. Well, for mercy's sake. It just goes to prove that I have a guardian angel. Well, now that you are found come and have a drink. Thanks, Bridget. There's nothing I'd like better but I have a friend with me. Well, bring him in. - He is a 'her'. A woman? Jimmy .. Hmm. She is a lady. A perfect lady. - Oh? Well bring her in anyway. Who is she? She is .. she is a kind of a cousin. Oh Jimmy. I would love to meet your 'kind of a cousin'. Well, I will ask her to come in. Jimmy. Mary is here. - Oh, is she? Is she? She is. - Well, isn't that nice. Anyone else? - No. Why? Well, I was just wondering. You see, my .. My cousin is a little bit shy. So, I thought if you had a crowd here .. we wouldn't come in. I'll be right back. Walter, find Mary and tell her that Jimmy is here with woman. Yes. - And Walter. Don't let on to Jimmy that Mr Woodruf has been here. I won't say a word. Oh dear. Guess what. A friend of mine lives here. - Really? She wants us to come in for a drink. - Fine. I .. I told her that you were sort-of a cousin. You did? But why? Well. Say no more. I see it all clearly. She's your big heartbeat and you don't to be caught lost with another woman. No, no. Not at all. I will wait here in the car while you have drinks. She needn't see me at all. Tell her your cousin is on the wagon. - No. There is another one in there. - Another one? Yeah. The one I am nuts about. I always have been and I always will be. Well, tell her who I am and how I got here. I'm sure she won't mind. But you don't understand. You see, I am .. I'm the dust under feet. Not the cream in her coffee. Now, you don't expect me to believe that. It's true. But .. I've got an idea. She's never seen me with another woman. Never thinks I am with another woman. So, if she saw me with you and .. We played things up a little bit. Well, she might sit up and take notice. Are you game? - Right to the finish. I won't tell her your name. It will tip her off that you're a respectable married lady you see. My name wouldn't mean anything to her. It might. As a matter of fact it would. She is a writer. She knows publishers. You have .. You have probably heard of her. Mary Howard. Yes, yes. Of course. - You like her stuff? One of her books was awfully good. Yeah. Now let me see. How shall I introduce you? Suppose I just half your name? Clare. Mrs Clare? How would that be? That suits me. Of half of me. I haven't had as much fun in a blue moon. Wait a minute. - What's the matter? Did you by any chance plan to get lost so this girl would see you with me? What? Aha. You did. - Now, so help me .. Aha. Of course you did. That is why you suggested the new road, wasn't it? Don't give me away, will you. This is the funniest things that's ever happened to me. Why me? Why didn't you pick one of those beautiful sweet young things? You know. The kind to be jealous of. No. She knows I'd not go for anyone like that. What? I mean, you are just the type she would be jealous of. That is better. - Yes. Jimmy, this afternoon is doing me so much good. Wait and see what it does for me. Bridget, I can't find Mary anywhere. - She drove down to the end of .. Shush. They will hear you. Bridgy, this is my cousin. Mrs .. Mrs Clare. How do you do, Mrs Clare? - And this is Mrs .. Bridgy, do you have another name? - 'Drake'. You idiot. Oh yes, yes. And this is Walter. Del Canto. - How do you do? What's the matter with you, Jimmy? Are you tight? No. Certainly not. That's why I'm so nervous. What an enchanting place. Oh, thank you. Why, it is lovely. But really lovely. I am so glad you like it. I don't when I have seen such an attractive room. It is sweet, isn't it. Walter made it over out of an old mill and a barn. Really? Ever tried to make something out of nothing, Mrs Clare? She's working on me now, Bridgy. I have given him up. I think everything is absolutely charming. Do you mind if I look round some more? - I'd love to have you do so. I want to show you a little room that Walter has set up here. I think you've done wonders. I am really enjoying it all. Thank you. - Right in here. Walter. Lightning. It is clouding up. Turn on the lights. Oh look. And Walter. Mix them one of your 'old mill' specials. Right. What was this room originally? The old grange room. Al that is left now is the rye. Bridget. Well, a lovely view. The old mill wheel. A babbling brook. The old millstone. Early American furniture. What was this over here, Bridgy? That was part of the barn. Where they milked the cows. The old milk room. Well, I bet the cows hated to leave. Or did they leave? Walter, did you hear that? You didn't get the smell out. Why, of course not. It's artistic, huh Walter? And what do you think? The last straw. Oh, Jimmy. Jimmy, you are so amusing. Isn't he amusing, Walter? Very. Ha-ha. Pardon, madame. Commence le boire. Pierre, how many times have I asked you please to parlez slowly. [ French language ] You don't have to tell me it's raining. I can see it perfectly well for myself. Well don't stand there looking at me like that. Do something. The windows. Close. Close the windows. Madame. J'ai d?j? ferm? les fen?tres. Will you please close the windows. [ French language ] All I ask is, will you please close .. Close the windows. I mean that, he's trying to tell you, Mrs Drake. That he's already closed the windows. For heaven's sake. Why didn't he say so in the first place? You may aller now, Pierre. Aller, aller. Je suis fini. Pierre is too aggravating. Hello? Where is everybody? In here, dear. It's beginning to pour down. I got in just in time. Hello Mary. - Hi, Jimmy. I .. I got lost and came in to find out where I was. And where do you think I am? Right here. This is Mrs Clare - Miss Howard. The Mary Howard I was told you about. How do you do, Miss Howard. - How do you do. So you got lost, huh? Yes. I was driving with Mrs Clare and on the way home I .. Took a shortcut. You seem to have quite a weakness for shortcuts. Yes. And then I .. Got lost. - Yes. That's right. And .. And found himself here. I don't know how I did it. Nonsense. You never do anything unless you want to. You know. That is the only thing I've ever seen you try that you haven't done perfectly. Well. Here you are. Thank you. I hope you like them. These are Walter's specials. He calls them 'the old mill'. Thank you, Walter. Excuse me. - Surely. Well .. here we go. Have you got my hankie? Jimmy-dimmy? Have I? I think I put it in your pocket. This one over here. It must be your other pocket. I put it in there when we were sitting under that tree. Remember? Under that tree. Oh yes, yes. Under the tree. We stopped the car and got out to look at the view. It was a lovely view. And so nice sitting there. Just the two of us. Yes. Everything was alright until that cow came to the back of you and mooed. You needn't laugh, darling. You were just as scared as I was. No. What scared me was when the cow's husband showed up. You should have seen the stranglehold she got on me. Can't you find my hankie, lamb? No, no .. no, I can't. Here, use mine. Snooks. Mrs Clare. Would you care to see the dining room? Yes. I would love to. A personally conducted tour. - Right through here. Thank you. Jimmy said that Mrs Clare is some kind of cousin. Oh? You didn't tell me you had a cousin, Jimmy. Well, there are cousins and cousins. She is the kind you don't talk about. Don't you think that Walter has done a beautiful job, Mrs Clare? I am just speechless with admiration. This must be a marvelous place to write. Hmm. Are you working here, Miss Howard? Yes. On my new book. How is the work coming along? - Splendidly, thank you. I've read several of your books. I liked them very much. They have a pleasant facility for .. For lifting one out of the prosaic realities of life. Oh? Thank you. When is the new one coming out? Very soon now. I just solved the last problem today. Did you, Mary? Well, well. I didn't know that. I saw you sitting pencil in hand .. But I didn't know anything was going on. Anything creative, I mean. This creative business is so funny. You never do know when it's going on. Are you creative, Mrs Clare? Not at all. I know I would be if I just let myself go. That is when I am creative. Mrs Clare. Would you care to see the rest of the house? I just can't wait. Bridgy. My car is out in the rain. Can I have your man put it in the garage? Yes. Of course. - Thank you. Mary. You think I should ask them to stay to dinner? It looks as though Jimmy has already decided that for you. Alright. Bridget. Coming. Excuse me, dear. Jimmy. Your cousin is charming. I'll bet. Why haven't I met her before? - You know. California. Honolulu and places like that. - Is she a widow? Well, practically. Ah, one of those. - Hmm. What is her name? Mrs Clare. - No. Her first name. Lottie. Lottie. You know, short for Carlota. And her husband? - That's just it. She seems terribly keen about you. Why shouldn't she be? - No reason at all. I just wonder if you're as keen about her as you seem. Why not? Only the other day you told me to find someone else. Well, I must say you are a very fast worker. I think it would be perfectly marvelous if you were married to a woman like her. You can write my life for me just as you write your books. I want you to be happy. First you want me to find a nice girl. Now you want me to be happy. As I've said before, that kind of talk coming from a lady means only one thing. She's in love with somebody else. Are you, Minnie? - As you're so understanding, why ask? Guilt sticks out all over you. In your eyes and voice and the room we're in. So you're psychic too. What was Woodruf doing in your house the other night? I've told you a good many times, dear. We were working on my book. You're lying. - Can you mind your own business. Tell me honestly, Mary. Are you in love with Woodruf? Yes I am. More than I ever thought I could be. Oh, darling. Don't you see this is different? We've had a lot of fun you and I, but .. Well. We two, Rogers and I. We meet on every plane and it's .. He is interested in my intellectually as well as .. Oh baloney. That big literary talk he gives you is nothing but a .. gimmick. A gimmick? I feel I'm not up on your vocabulary. - It's nothing but a line. He is nuts about you for the same reason I am and it's not because you're brainy. Mercy. It is getting worse and worse. The storm, I mean. Jimmy, I don't see how you and your cousin will ever get away in this. Mrs Drake, I think every room in this house is the loveliest thing I ever saw. How kind of you to say so. Jimmy, we should be going now. But .. Look at the rain. - Even so. Where is my coat? Mrs Clare. Do you like lightning? I am sure you do. You look so calm and poised. Say, that must have struck close by. Walter, Walter. The smelling salts. It isn't the lightning. It's the electricity. We'll be alright, Bridget. Be calm, sweet. It is alright. Is there anything I can do? Where are the smelling salts? They're up there in that little drawer. It is alright, Bridget. Alright. Everything will be alright. I suppose this will give you an excuse to stay and annoy me all through dinner. Don't you want me to stay? - No. I don't, dear. Mrs Clare. Minnie here says we must stay to dinner. Bridgy won't take no for an answer. She doesn't hear you. Mrs Clare. - Mrs Clare. Why so formal? Lottie. Say. Lottie. I am afraid, Lottie, we will have to stay. I am talking to you, Lottie. Oh. I see. I see now. That thunder made me a little deaf too. - Yes. What were you saying? I said we're staying for dinner whether we're welcome or not. Are we? Of course you are welcome. - I'm afraid we're a terrible nuisance. Not at all. Nuisances are my speciality. What I mean is .. I love to have company. Madame. Madame. [ French language ] Pierre, je suis in no condition to cope with your problems. [ French language ] Why can't I be told what is going on in my own house? Excuse me. Pierre says the lightning struck a tree. And knocked it across the driveway. Just this side of the gate. Well, in that case we won't be able to get the cars out. Why don't you move it. Movez, movez. Why do you stand there looking at me like that? [ French language ] Je suis fini. It looks like you're going to have house guests as well as dinner guests, Bridgy. Oh, I forgot. About dinner. Walter. I think that .. You had better tell Pierre there will be two extra. No matter what he says, be firm. Right. Mary, let's play some bridge and take our minds off the storm. Alright. Jimmy, there is a red card table down there in that cabinet by the fireplace. Be a darling and get it, will you. Suppose they spend the night. What will I do? What can you do? Put Jimmy in the barn of course. But what will I do with his cousin? I can't put her in the same barn. - No. Maybe I could put her in the room next to you? Why not? Go ahead. Oh, the cards. Excuse me, Jimmy. Cards. Cards. Pencils. Thanks. You play very nicely. Thank you. Anything else in the way of accomplishments? I used to be quite active in sports. Tennis and, boating. My only sport is taking long walks. I've walked miles playing golf. I've rather given that up lately. - Why? There shouldn't be more than one good golfer in a family. Really? Why not? I've discovered that it does not pay to be too capable. Husbands don't approve. Well. Look at this. It's as old as the hills but I love it. Yes. So do I. Do you know it? - Yes. And again. I love thee more than all else under heaven. I love thee. I love thee. I love body through all eternity. I love. Thee. For .. eternity. Jimmy. Walter! It's nothing but a fuse blown, Bridget. That's all. Light the candles. Pierre and I will get some more from the kitchen. Poor Bridgy. You girls seem to be quite in harmony. She isn't a bit jealous of you, Jimmy. For that matter, neither is she of me. I suppose you have just been tossing me back and forth to each other. Well, I wanted you two to meet. You have got a lot in common. Look out for the top step, Mrs Clare. Thank you. For mercy's sake. Of course. Now everybody gets ready to go to bed and turn off the lights, on they come. The storm seems to be about over. This is your room, Mrs Clare. Right next to Mary's. How nice and neighbourly. I thought you'd prefer that to being over in the barn next to Jimmy. Or do you? Oh. This is fine, thanks. Oh. Mary. I had Rogers' luggage put in that other room in the barn. You know, just in case. - Yes. Let's go and see if she's comfortable. - Alright. I do hope you have everything you need. I forgot to get your nightie and toothbrush and things. It's a shame to be giving you so much trouble. No trouble at all. I'm tickled to death to have somebody use one of those toothbrushes. I've had them on hand for years. She is kind. - Yes. Isn't she. Well, now I have telephoned home I can relax. Comfortable? - I should say so. We are having so much fun. This is a real adventure. I hate things to be too humdrum, don't you? But somehow, things never seem to happen to me. I don't know why not. You seem to be oozing with some vitality and vibrations. My vibrations have been a little on the subdued side of late. You and Jimmy have keyed them up considerably. Yes. Jimmy certainly is good at 'keying people up'. You don't really think that .. What? Nothing. Go ahead and say it. You don't think for a minute do you that Jimmy cares anything at all about me? In that way. I hope so. Nothing could be finer for Jimmy. Nothing could be finer for me. For any woman. Jimmy has the makings of a wonderful husband. A husband? Are you kidding? He has a quality that is very rare. He is one of those men who is very attractive to women. And never realises it. And then too .. Jimmy is a one-woman man. And having once found the one he wanted, if he got her .. He wouldn't be looking around. Ever. That guy makes a marvelous husband. Do you believe that most men think somebody else wants them? Of course. And somebody usually does. But there isn't anything of that in Jimmy and it makes him so sweet. I just love him. Yes. But I get awfully mad at him sometimes. I am so mad at him right now I could kill him. Are you? Why? Here's your things. Here is the cold cream and the skin tonic. They are really awfully good. Look at what they have done for me. Or am I worse? - No, darling. You're beautiful. You never can tell about yourself, can you. And there is the darned old toothbrush and paste. Aren't you a darling. And here is your nightie and negligee. Just imagine sleeping in things as lovely as these. Well, Bridget believes in keeping up her standards at night. I certainly do. Suppose there's an earthquake? Goodnight, Mrs Clare. Goodnight and thank you very much for everything. I am having a lovely time. Thank you. Goodnight, Mary. Goodnight. You know, I think we're awfully cosy, we three. You see, most women who know anything treat me as though I didn't. But you and Mary don't. Oh, the mules. These ones I keep beside my chair in case anyone goes in my room by mistake. Has anyone ever? Not in years. I adore Bridgy. She is the most intelligent fool I've ever known. For mercy's sake. Will you look at these two things I found prowling around. Hello Mary. Lottie. - Hello. What are you doing here? I'm taking a look at the rest of the house. I like to get the layout of the place before I go to sleep. In case of fire. You know, I was in a house once that caught fire in the middle of the night. People came out of the strangest places. Where do you sleep, Walter? Down at the other end of the hall. - That is my room. And this is where I sleep. - Right in here? Right next door to each other. - Hmm. Well, that's fine. Very nifty. Very nifty. What I want to know is why I am out in the barn all alone? I am house broken. Because there's no other rooms, idiot. - No? Where is your room, Bridgy? In case of fire and you need help. Right across the hall. That is where I am going now. Night, night. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Well, I will be off to my little cell. If lightning strikes me at least I'll be alone. That will be a lucky break. For you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Sorry to have dragged you into town on a wild goose chase. I can't understand what has happened to Bix. Keep after him and if you do locate him call me at that same number. You know. I'll be there over the weekend. - Okay, chief. Goodnight. - Goodnight, Harry. [ Door knocks ] May I come in? Yes. Please do. Sorry to disturb you but this outfit demands an audience. Sensational. I really ought to go and start that fire that Jimmy was talking about. No. Don't go unless you're sleepy. - Not a bit. Come in. - Thank you. Sit down. - Thanks. Put your feet up. Make yourself comfortable. A cigarette? - I would love one. Does this feel good. I left the house at 8 o'clock this morning. You must be tired. - A little. So. Finishing your new book, eh? Yes. I will be very interested to know what you think of it. I'll read it the minute it comes out and wrote to you. You know, two men have told me two different things about it. One of them has the colossal masculine effrontery to say that .. 'If a woman is good she's good and if she's bad she's bad'. 'And that's all there is to it'. Men are so proper and conventional about their own 'good women', aren't they. Some of them are. The 'old school' type. But don't you think that if a man is really in love he doesn't give a darn .. In how many other men she might have been in love with before she met him. He wants to marry her just the same. Yes .. but .. In my book the situation is a little different. The man can't marry the girl. Why not? He is already married. - Oh. But theirs isn't just an ordinary case. You see. They have numerous interests in common. Intellectual, cultural. They live in a world apart and always will. That is how the girl knows that their love is justified. You understand her viewpoint, don't you? Yes. If she loves him terrifically. But .. - But what? The hard thing for me to believe .. Is that she believes this man when he says he loves her. Oh, a woman always knows when a man is in love. Perhaps. But .. speaking as a married woman. I feel your girl, if she has been around .. Ought to know enough not to believe a married man when he makes love to her. Can't a man, even though he's married .. Fall as deeply and as honestly in love as a woman? Of course. If he honestly loves this other girl and if the wife still loves him. It's the most tragic situation in the world for the three of them. What in the name of heaven can they do? How do you work it out? - Well. After she's been in love with him for months she decides to .. What's the wife doing all this time? She doesn't know. Doesn't know that for months her husband has been in love with someone else? No. She doesn't even suspect. Well. Either she is very stupid or her husband is incredibly clever. This is very interesting. Go on. Tell me what happens. Well, the girl. Eileen. Makes her decision. She decides to face it out with the man she loves and take the consequences. Well. You will write it brilliantly. I am sure of that. But tell me. What is it that you can't quite accept? How can your girl .. Eileen. Think that his man is worth what it costs her? Costs her? - Yes. Her place in the sun. Her place with her fellow human beings and most important of all, with herself. But on the other hand don't you see if she were .. Cowardly enough to deny this love of theirs. She would feel for the rest of her life that she had .. That she had not only cheated herself but him too. Perhaps. But I think it takes an awfully big man with an awfully big nature .. To appreciate what she has done and stick. If he isn't married to her. I feel that he'd be apt after a while .. To wish that she hadn't been quite so magnificent for his sake. You know, you sound just like Jimmy. Do I? - Uhuh. Well, perhaps I am not a good judge of this story. You see. I happen to be married to a man who can no more help attracting other women .. Than he can help breathing. And of course, each one thinks that she is the love of his life. And that he will ultimately divorce me and marry her. But he doesn't seem to. Somehow. Well, that's because you are you. I mean .. You are not the type that men desert. No. You are just not that kind of woman. We are all that kind of woman. There is nothing to be done about it. It's that terrible .. getting tired of the things we are used to. Nobody can help it really. I get very tired of him sometimes. But I made him my man and I've built my life around him. Really? I understood from Jimmy that you were .. Well .. more or less free. He was trying to make you jealous. No. No. There has never been but one man for me and there never will be. In spite of all the competition. Somehow I think you are very wise. I am not so wise. When the first one came to light it very nearly killed me. I thought the end of everything had come. And then. When the second bobbed up it took the sting out of the first. Because I knew then that one didn't mean any more to him than the other. I can always tell when one of his infatuations is on the wane. He turns back to the good old comfortable institution of marriage. Just as naturally as a baby to a bottle. I am sorry. Thank you. My, you have attractive hands. Lovely long slender fingers like .. Like a thoroughbred. Thank you. I am grateful. I haven't heard that said about my hands for quite some time. Go ahead. You said you had built your life around him. Yes. I have. He still has more charm for me than anyone else in the world. I think that is wonderful. I see what other women see in him. And it gets me just as it gets them. But you hold him against all others. And you know that no other vital thing is ever going to come his way. I used to believe that. But now, just lately .. I am not so sure it hasn't come. Really? There is somebody now. And it may be the real thing. Why not? It could happen of course. - No, not with you. I don't believe it. I hardly ever see him nowadays. I don't know where he is most of the time. I like awake half the night telling myself what a fool I am to care. When I hear his key in the latch .. Everything in the world is right again. I go to sleep halfway happy. Trying to make myself believe that this one too .. Will pass. But what if he .. Suppose he did .. Love somebody else? - Yes. Really love her. After all, things like that do happen you know. And when they do .. Well. I loathe her. With a deadly hate that would shrivel her up. I'd tell her every bitter truth she is ever going to learn. The truths that only a wife can know. Truths? I would say to her .. Of course, you are something new and interesting. Of course, I look the same old way and sound the same old way .. And walk and talk the same old way. But so will you. After a little while. Do not forget that. I would say. Of course I can understand his loving you. But are you prepared to stand up to the job of loving him? Most of the things you find irresistible in him are very hard to live with. You have got to love him so abjectly that you'd gladly play second fiddle .. Just to keep the music going for him. Well, surely love makes that quite easy? No. It doesn't. I think it makes everything most difficult. I think from the time those two women met and faced each other .. And talked things out, life would be an impossible mess for all of them. Now you sound like Rogers. Like .. Who? Rogers Woodruf. My publisher. He was here today working with me. What's the matter? Are you ill? - No. It's nothing. May I get you something? - No thank you. Are you sure you're alright? - Yes, I am quite alright. Really. What were you saying about your publisher? Nothing. Except he has been helping me. Does he like your book? Oh yes. Yes. He thinks the girl is the best thing I have ever done, but .. The wife, he says isn't quite as real. What does he think about the man? Does he think the man will stick to this new love? This girl who has thrown overboard her self-respect. Everything that is worthwhile in life. Yes. He says it would make him love her all the more. I suppose you have done the girl so well because you believe she is right. I suppose you would do the same thing yourself. Yes. I would. I believe a love like that should come before everything. She didn't go after this man or take him away from anyone. He was just there. So what could they do? It came. It was. That's all. You can't hope to hold him as just yourself. I don't care how beautiful or clever or wonderful you are. He has to have something in him that will make him stick. Nothing else can pull a man and woman .. Through the heart-breaking job of living together. [ Door knocks ] Hello, dearest. - Hello. My office had the message from Bix wrong. Had a dreadful time coming back. I had to leave my car on the highway and climb over a tree to .. Oh. Mr Woodruf .. - What are you doing here, Clare? She doesn't know who I am, Rogers. I am Clare Woodruf. Jimmy Lee brought me up here for a joke. It is rather ridiculous, isn't it. Now you turn up. It is really very funny. Miss Howard has just told me that you are her publisher. Yes. I've helped her with her book. - Yes, Of course. We have been talking about the book. Among other things, discussing what both women may say to each other if they met. It seems to me that it is up to the man to do the talking. Don't you think so, Rogers? Don't you think it's rather up to him .. To tell both women which one he wants to spend the rest of his life with. When the right time comes, I do. But not as a part of this .. joke. Yes. Of course. By all means. It should be the right time. I believe I have your room, Rogers. You can go out that way. Don't come to my room. I will be asleep. Goodnight. Goodnight. Mary. - Please, Rogers. Let's not discuss it now. Goodnight. Goodnight. Come in. Well, hello Woodruf. So you are my neighbor. I was wondering whose luggage was in the room next door. Sit down and have a cigarette. - No thanks. It just occurred to me you might know who it was .. Who called my office pretending to be Timothy Bix. Why would anyone want to do a thing like that? For no other reason than to deliberately humiliate a girl. Just because she happens to prefer someone else to you. To me? To say nothing of hurting still another person who never did you any harm. It seems to me when it comes to causing humiliation and hurt .. You've got the shoe on the wrong foot. Don't you think? Whatever has happened could have been worked out in a decent, adult way. Instead of having interference from outsiders. I'm not exactly an outsider. You see, I happen to be in love with Mary, as you probably know. What's more, I've been her closest friend for years. I imagine she knows how good a friend you are now. She knows darned well the kind of a friend I am. She thinks you're in love with her which warps her judgement. It hasn't warped mine though. As I had a hunch from the very beginning that you're not on the level with Mary. Or yourself. So I think she ought to know before things went any further just .. Just what she is letting herself in for. That's why I wanted her to meet your wife. So she learned what this was doing to one of the finest women I've ever met. You can leave Clare out of this. Alright. But I got to hand it to you, Woodruf. You're a darned lucky picker of women. Now you've crashed your way into this situation like a bull in a china shop .. Would you mind clearing out? I am quite sure Mary won't want to see you again. Okay. If Mary wants to see you after all this I'll bow out of the picture for good. But I'd like to tip you off to one thing, Woodruf. If anything goes wrong with Mary I will hold you responsible. And I am not clowning. Goodnight. Hello? Ridge garage? Will you please send a taxi to Mrs Drake's on Lower Maple Lane. Yes. Yes, thank you. Oh, there is a fallen tree blocking the driveway. Yes. So if you just park on the highway and sound your horn I'll come right out. Yes. As soon as possible. Thank you. I didn't know anyone was up. I was going to .. - You needn't leave. I've already phoned for a taxi. Mary. I am going to look you up in New York after I've had a chance to think a bit. The suddenness and the shock .. Kept me from saying all that should be said. I thought you were pretty definite. Well, it did rather look as if you had already made up your mind .. What you planned to do before you met me. You had, hadn't you? Yes. Because I'd made sure that he loved me. You think he does love you? I know he does. Then, a thing I always thought would happen .. Has happened at last. I can't begin to tell you how sorry I am but .. It had to happen like this. I was hoping it might be different somehow. I don't know why I thought so but I did. But surely you must have known that even a .. Different woman resents being cast aside. I'd give anything in the world if there was some other way we could solve this. What can I say? I believe you. In fact. I have been thinking over all the things that you and I have said to each other. And now I find myself .. Rather admiring and liking you. And I know that whatever is between you and Rogers. It isn't anything cheap or common. Please believe this. It is beyond me how any man who had ever known you could .. Even think of anyone else. Except you. Where are you going? To call for a taxi and go. Home. Mary, do you know where Clare is? - Yes. She is in there phoning for a taxi. Darling, don't go in yet. Don't see her now. Why not? I have just talked to her and there's nothing you can say now to help her. We must let her be alone for a while. To try and find herself a little before she has to face you. Darling, what is it? What is the matter? I have never really cared for you as much as now. Why now? Because you are thinking first of her. But of course I am. I've never been honest with a single soul in my whole life, Mary. Not even .. With her. But I am going to be honest with you. Go ahead, Rogers. I think that you are great enough .. To surmount every obstacle that we would ever have to face together. I know that I am not. Until tonight I had fooled myself that you and I could go on forever .. Living in a world of our own. I was too busy. Conjuring up those .. Very highly-colored dreams to come down to .. Honest reality. But the moment she walked in on those dreams. They suddenly .. Went all grey. I see. I didn't know it would happen. I was too selfish and too self-centered. So you see, I haven't only been fooling you, Mary. And her. I've been fooling myself. Do you think she will take you back? I pray she does. I want to thank you. I must thank you for adding me to your collection. Mary. Don't. I ought to be a museum piece in that collection of yours. I am the girl who knew all about everything. Who knew about love with a capital 'L'. Who knew about that other thing too. That tawdry .. or whatever else it was you felt for me. I am the girl who dedicated her life to tell others about these things in books. I am the one who thought I .. Inspired a world-shattering romance. I was another Juliet. A modern Francesca. Oh yes. I was .. even then Elizabeth Barrett Browning. And all the while I was .. Just another one of your adventures. - Oh, my sweet. But I am learning, Rogers. I am learning fast. I am finding out that .. An intelligent woman of the world .. can be a fool. A silly, immature fool. Well, for mercy's sake what is going on down here? Oh. So you did get back? Hello, Bridget. Well, may I join the party? For goodness sake what is the matter with you people? Don't you know what beds are for? Or do you? Or is that the wrong thing to say? I am sorry, Mary. - Jimmy. Please don't say anything. For mercy's sake, isn't that a one. I had quite a time explaining that we wanted two cabs sent out here. Cabs? What for? I am going back to town. In two cabs? Don't tell me she is twins? No, dear. I ordered the other one. Please. Won't you just let me say goodbye and thank you very, very much. Goodbye? Goodbye? You'd think it's a nightclub with people coming and going, ordering cabs .. And saying hello and goodbye at 2 o'clock in the morning. If you can wait until the tree is removed I will drive you home. Thank you, Jimmy. But .. I'll wait for the cab. Of course, if I had the vaguest notion of what's going on in my own house .. I might be more intelligent about it. - Sorry. I forgot. Jimmy, would you mind explaining your little joke? Oh, a joke. What joke? Bridgy. This is Mrs Woodruf. Oh? This is Mrs Woodruf. This is Mrs Woodruf. Is that so? Yes. You see, Jimmy passer her off as his cousin to play a joke on me. Oh? Jimmy passed her off as his cousin to play a joke on you. Is that so? Well, I'll be hanged. What is the idea? What in the world are you doing down here, Bridgy? Me? I am a ship in a fog tooting a horn. Well, you see, Walter. Jimmy brought the man's wife here as Jimmy is in love with the man's girl. And the man's wife wants to take a taxi home at 2 in the morning. And the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and anyhow it's all a joke. Correct me if I am wrong. I apologise, Bridgy. You see, darling. I thought maybe a couple of clowns over the weekend might amuse you. And then the place got thick with clowns. Then they started making fun of real things and real people. Now, all we have succeeded in doing is .. To make a horrible mess of your charming place. But if it does all of you any good to know that I am ashamed of myself. You hear me say it because I am. Terribly ashamed. Mary. Mary, darling. What you need is a cup of coffee. No Thanks, Bridgy. I am going up to pack my things. But you can't go now. What about your last chapter? That is finished. Everything is solved. Mary is such a fool, but I love her for it. It makes me feel so close to her. Well, anyhow I need coffee even if nobody else does. Come on, Walter. Help me make it. - Alright, Bridget. Sorry I let you in for this, Clare. Dead sorry. It's alright, Jimmy. It was bound to happen. Sometime. Clare. I'll take you home. No thanks, Rogers. Will you believe me when I tell you .. You are all my life? It doesn't matter, Rogers. Clare. This time it is different. Always before I have been thankful when it was over. Always thinking of you. Never of .. her. This time I have seen her. And something has happened to me. I've seen all of her. Her heart and soul. And I know so well how you've made her love you like that. Clare, listen to me. I'm trying to tell you. No, Rogers. Now, it is the last time for me. What do you mean? You don't even know what I am talking about, do you? You can't imagine that I could stop loving you. But you see that is what has happened. I've eaten a lot of humble bread in the years I have been with you. An awful lot. For the sake of our home and .. Because I have loved you very deeply. Always, I thought .. I thought the time had come when we would put these .. These silly bad things behind us. And then maybe we would .. We would have children and a real home and .. And a life together that was real. But there is something so brutal in the way that you have treated this girl. She wasn't playing any cheap game with you, Rogers. Which the others were. And you're not worth one minute of a single anxious hour .. That either one of us has given you. You are never going to cost me another one. Never. [ Car horn ] [ Car horn ] There is my cab. - Clare. Goodbye, Rogers. Well, Woodruf. There has to be a first time for everything. Some woman was bound to say 'no' to you and mean it. You know, the trouble with a lot of men is they're .. too smart. They choose to think that the simple things in life like a home .. Kids and a fireside is all a lot of copybook stuff. It's meant for children and morons. Yes. I know that now. Do you have a light? Yes. Thanks. Look, Woodruf. Why not try and get your feet back under your own table again? It will be a battle. But two great women have thought pretty well of you. Who know? One of them might again. I doubt there is much chance of that. - I'll bet there is. What you need is a quick follow-up before you lose that woebegone look. Go on. Try to catch up with her. She might let you ride in on the running board. I'd like to think she would. You'll never know unless you try. I'll try. Thanks. Good luck. Now Walter, I don't care if it does keep me awake. Be careful you don't slip. Where will I put it? Over here. And then you can get me that chair. Alright. Oh, Mary. You are not really leaving, are you? Yes, Bridget. I am. Well, you have got to have a cup of coffee to cheer you on your way. It's all ready. Oh. Go right ahead. Go right ahead, Mary. I'll stay way over here. Across the room. Come over here dear and be comfortable right here in this chair. If I were you Mary, I'd never forgive Jimmy. If a woman must make a fool of herself .. The least a man can do is to let her be one in her own way. Of course, it's happened to me so often I never expect anything else. I mean, making a mistake about a man. But when it happens to an intelligent woman like you .. Walter is being subtle. Of course, there is no denying that the only real unhappiness in life .. Is losing a man. If he dies, well then that is a different matter. If you lose him that way you know it isn't your fault. You know. Death isn't nature's greatest mistake. Falling in love is. If we didn't do that .. All of the misery in life would be cut right out of it. But my goodness, so would all the fun. So, what are you going to do about it? Ahem. Could I have just a small cup of coffee? Alright. Come on over. Not that you deserve it after the way you've treated this poor girl. Mary, I don't see how you could ever even look at him again. Just because you couldn't force her to fall in love with you. You play a mean, despicable, practical joke. Oh really, Jimmy. It is too much. You are not welcome here. And I am sure Mary doesn't want to see you anymore. Bridgy, lay off Jimmy. It wasn't all his fault. Well. Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair. I am going to bed. Come along, Walter. I didn't man that. What I meant was .. goodnight. Or is it morning? [ Car horn ] So this is goodbye, huh? It looks like it. Not for always. I think it is better that way. Don't you, Jimmy? Well, alright. If that is the way you want it. Anyhow. We've had fun. So, thanks for the memories, Minnie. I'll carry your bags out for you. [ Car horn ] Jimmy. Yeah, Minnie? Jimmy, I've made an awful .. Will you please stop calling me Minnie. Why should I? You won't be around to hear me. Every morning when I'll say to the alarm clock .. 'Well old pal, how do you think Minnie is feeling this AM'? Then I hop in the shower and go to town. I'll sing at the top of my voice like this .. I dream of Minnie with the light-blue eyes. May I please have my bag? Oh. Your glasses are over here. You mustn't forget these. 0h. Minnie. Why in the world doesn't somebody take that cab? [ Car horn ] What is going on, Bridget? Walter. This is where we came in. ..w-g..
