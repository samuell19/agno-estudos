Today is Lydia's 11th birthday. If only I could bake her a cake and have a nice day with her and Gerhard. Gerhard is only 1 km away but unreachable nevertheless. But I must not give up hope, ever. What keeps us all strong is the belief that our fate serves a higher purpose, victory for the Revolution, victory for Communism. How much easier it would be if our torturers were enemies... But by the hands of comrades? Why? Are you mad? Does she have a fever? You must go back! Gerhard, please! Just two years. We will make it! You must go, now. Stop! Stay right there! I wasn't escaping! I just wanted to see my daughter. Lydia, it's her birthday. I haven't seen her for three years. She lives with her mother! Stop lying! - It's the truth, comrade! Shoot him! - I'm a Communist! An engineer! I helped build the Moscow metro. Comrade Stalin was at the inauguration... - Shoot him, come on! Long live Communism! Long live Comrade Stalin! Is this your husband? I asked you a question! Sign here, quickly now! ...I said hurry up! Let's Go At the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds have climbed the Wall to get a glimpse of the other side. But the East German boarder patrol is nowhere to be seen. People help each other climb up. Thousands of from East and West Berlin have come together at the Wall. Together, they want to experience this memorable day. You don't want to come? Do you feel ill? Come on. Mrs. Berger. Of course, I'm watching. I envy Irma that she didn't live to see. Konrad, please. I don't want to fight. Then why did you call? You know what it means to me. You want me to admit you were right? Oh, Konrad. The truth... When should I have told her? Toni! Are you insane? Your husband is dead. You live! Your child lives! Have you forgotten? I wrote to our embassy in Moscow again. They cannot pretend we don't exist! Get up! Work on! Move! I'll ask again. Comrade Heck. Your son has been waiting half an hour. I have information... that you made contact with our embassy in Moscow. You don't have enough to do as the head of Interflug airlines? The ambassador called me. It's about Comrade Schumann, your former secretary in Moscow. She is innocent, you know. Just like Antonia Berger of the Left Column and Irma Seibert... And who else then? Dozens of our comrades rot in the gulags. Innocent. For crimes they didn't commit, and we turn a blind eye. It happened to many. It could have been you. - It was war. How were our Soviet comrades to know whom they could depend upon? 1938 was before the war, father. None of Lenin's friends lived through the year. Did they all suddenly turn to enemies? And you wish to bring them back? In my name? - They are our comrades! We were exiled together. I love the Soviet Union. It is my second home. Injustice is still injustice! Do what you will. But remember: this conversation never took place. Schumann, Susanna? Yes. Berger, Antonia? Yes. What will happen to us? Siebert, Irma? You will leave Vorkuta in one hour. You may bring one 30 kilo bag. Your work clothes stay here. Where are we going? You have one hour. Go! Stop the truck! What's going on? - My child is dying of fever! Back to the truck! Hurry up! Lydia! Lydia! Come on. Hold onto me. Our guests from Moscow. Hannah Sydow, of the German Communist Party. Welcome to the German Dem... - My child needs a doctor. All in good time... - Now! Fine, then... let's go to the clinic first. You can bring the others to the guest home from there. Where's the children's ward? - Second floor. We have to go upstairs. Almost there, sweetie. Try again. Why are you coming so late? Your daughter has frostbite. Her ID will be sent after... - Not possible. Of course, it is. - I'll have to ask the doctor. What's the matter? - She has no insurance ID. Who exactly are we treating? I'm with party leadership, and this comrade just arrived with her child in the GDR. Aha. And what should I write? - Nothing. The ID will be here in a few days, and you can add it. The best medicine available: penicillin. She has to drink it all. Please, Lydia, drink this. We have so often dreamed about our future. Try to drink this, please. If your daughter survives the night, she is saved. It's taken care of. If anyone asks where you're from, it's none of their business. I spoke with the nurse. You may use the bathroom. There's a shower too. I'll be back tomorrow. Try to sleep. Where is my child? What is her name? Berger. Lydia Berger. Here we are. Ernst-Th√©lmann-Strafie 12. Look here. From next week, you'll get a newspaper too. Come along. I'll wait downstairs. - We'll be right down. Here are... 500 marks, for the basics. And your food ration stamps. We have work placements for you, based on your professions before emigrating to the USSR. Despite that being a long time ago. So... Comrade Berger... will take over the "House of the People." With your theater experience, we are sure you're the right person. Comrade Schumann will work for the Freies Wort publishing house. The editor in chief is Comrade Michel. He's expecting you soon. Comrade Seibert, we're looking for a placement in food services. Tomorrow, I will know more. If you have questions... Good morning. Leo Silberstein. Secretary for Agitation and Propaganda. Hello. Are you settling in? I see everything set up fine: apartment, work, money. Don't hesitate to ask me any questions, or Comrade Sydow. To finalize it all, please sign here: bottom right. This... This says that we... We didn't work in "various places" in the USSR. We were in a labor camp. Innocent. "Hereby, I undertake "to give no spoken or written testimony about my stay in the Soviet Union no information whatsoever. I have been notified that infringement thereof violates the laws of the GDR and punishable." I know what we ask of you, comrades. I refuse that salutation. I am no longer a comrade. What you have experienced has nothing to do with Communism. But you mustn't forget we are on a path unknown to history. There shall come a time to clear the air. But not now. You were gone so long. Much has changed. In the West are the Nazis who hate us. But here, we are in power. Soviet labor camps? Innocent prisoners? Do you know what that means? Who do you think we are dealing with? Our people change convictions like the wash: brown shirts for red banners. Do you know what will happen to you if you tell your stories'? They'll change again, and our opportunity is gone. You've been rehabilitated. Not officially, but to me. That'll do for now. What do we say when asked where we've been these past years? Working around the USSR, like it says there. The higher-ups in Berlin agreed on this formulation. We have to know we can trust you. How is your daughter? Dr. Zeidler took care of her personally. Ah, my friend Konrad. Then she's in good hands, the best. You must speak with her before she is in school. It's no one's business where she was before. Well then... Welcome to Filrstenberg. Farewell. The first thing they do is make us bite our tongues. The first thing they do is give us apartments and work and save my child. Sorry for mixing up the order of events. Their problem with us is that we survived. They forgot about us, and now we must lie. "Where were you then?" In a labor camp... - Shh! With a red star above the gate! Hush! - And I have to lie! What kind of Socialism do we wed that offers such a dowry? Let's build the future, but ask nothing of my past! It can't have been in vain. - It was. Any thief knows why he's arrested, and we? Maybe it's good we signed. It's a reprieve from thinking about it! We suffered so much, why keep talking about it? It's about them deciding what we can say and what we can't. Not a thing as changed! What will you say about your husband? That he got lost in Siberia? Or will you ask the Party first? What will be the next lie? When do we meet again? Jumping jacks, and two and three... Come and see, you'll be amazed. Six, seven, eight, nine... ten! And knee bends. Arms forward... Her first calisthenics. I'd like to give your brave daughter something. I've asked what she wants. You've done plenty already. She is better but not recovered. And backwards! May I get you a coffee in the cafeteria? I have to be going. It's my first day of work. Oh? Well, break a leg. Thank you. And the other way. It's gotten cold, eh? Good morning. - Hello. I thought I ought to be here for your first day. Have you settled in a bit? Do you have news of Comrade Schumann? I thought maybe... Here we are. Come on in. Come on. You're expected. Thank you. - You're welcome. After you. Dear friends, this is Antonia Berger, your new director. As you know, great events cast a long shadow ahead. April 10th next year our town will host the first GDR Agricultural Conference. On greater collectivization. It's not merely an honor, it means a lot of hard work over the next few weeks. Now, this is to remain between us: Our president, Comrade Ulbricht will attend the opening. I hope you understand what this means. Comrade Kuppers. When I heard who our director would be, I couldn't believe it. It's a rarity. A treasure I've been guarding. This is almost 20 years old. The Left Column's first record, from the year 1932. When the dark times descended, I listened over and over. Secretly, quietly... I never could have imagined hearing this in a theater such as this. In our House of the People. And with you, Comrade Berger! I know the story of the Left Column. We were 15 friends. We traveled the land, singing songs of... the future of Communism. Which were one and the same. We were invited to Moscow. Moscow is big... Bigger than Moscow, we couldn't imagine. Shot to death. All the others. For no reason. By our own comrades. Why? I'm the only one who survived. We cannot bring the dead back. But we can make the world better. This... must never happen again. Is there any other job for me? In administration, maybe? Please. Revolution doesn't sing requests. I'm sorry. My name is Hermann Krilger, I'm 11, and I'm going to be a race car driver. My name is Helga and I want to be a chef. My name is Waltraud and I want to become a princess. My name is Friedhelm and... I don't know what I want to be, yet. My name is Johanna and I want to be A famous actress. C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C. A, G, F, E, D, C. Once again, with spirit. Three steps to the right. Three to the left. Now tip toes. Now hold hands. Cross. And now open over cross. That's right. Once more, please. Could it be one big show, put on to erase the past? All just scenery? The apartment, the theater, the city, this whole half of a country. Scenery, and I the marionette. Is this an injustice? Or the truth? So, breathe in deep. Does it hurt? Very good. You stay home the next few days. Get lots of sleep. If you go out... always dress warm. Go ahead, open it. Is this for me? Then, let's go. Cold is dangerous for her. My car is outside. Come. We even have a "swim-tub!" Close your eyes. Open them. Hello. Did I indeed hear the new neighbor come in? Hiicker. Alois Hiicker. Antonia Berger. Antonia. What a pretty name! Please, call me Alois. First names only, we're a family here. If you need anything, just shout. How about a welcome drink, ours at eight? We have to have a toast! I'm not... I was just dropping them off. - And so? See you at eight? Next door. May I have this dance, young lady? RIAS Berlin, the free voice of... No one wants to hear that propaganda! Tell us, dear Antonia, - if I may-where you come from. I'm from Vienna, orig... - Vorkuta. The Soviet Union. Really? We'll if that's not worth a toast! The Soviet Union. It was my dream. But the language... We Austrians are a bit lazy, having a monarchy for too long, no doubt. And what did you do there? I made myself useful. Take care of the drinks before you get too nosy with our new neighbor. Of course, darling. No one goes thirsty here. Dear friends! Let's toast our new neighbors. Let's toast to this wonderful evening, and to the man whom we must thank for it all. Our happiness and our future. Let's toast to Comrade Stalin. To Stalin! Dearest Antonia, may I ask you something? I can guess. - Here it comes. When may I paint your portrait? I called it! Not a nude! You may feel honored, my husband rarely paints portraits. Since we came, you've done only Pieck's and Brecht's portraits. Bertolt Brecht? - The same. Poor man stood still for two hours, and cursed so! I said to him, now you know what it is to sit through your shows! If anyone ever asks again where we're from, you say: A village. Nothing more. No matter who asks. Never say "Vorkuta" again. Will you promise me? Never. Yes. That word doesn't exist. Do you understand? Yes. It's best if you forget. Sleep well. This will be your classroom after the winter break. Grade 4b. Guess where your seat is. Look closer. She'll settle in quickly, believe me. It's easy at her age. One more thing. What's the matter? - May I take them? They belong to you. This is the cafeteria, where all the children eat lunch, and of course you can sit with your friends while eating. Keep the rhythm. Very nice. Dr. Zeidler. I came to see how you're doing. It was my first day of school. - Really! - Really. That's great! - Look what I can do again. Hello. - Lydia! You could join the circus with that trick. Know the butt carousel? Wait for the carousel. Now, have a seat on my legs. Right. Hold on for a wild ride! One, two, three! Another round? - Yes! - One, two, three. A present. For the occasion. May I? Leg? Greetings. (H9)'- Need a hand? Yes, in there. On there. Careful. May I present your new, one of the first GDR TV sets! What is a TV set? - It's the future. All modern man's needs comes out of this device: news, films, sports. How does it get in there? Through the ether, young miss. What is... Ether? Invisible rays. On the occasion of Stalin's 73rd birthday, the first German TV station begins broadcasting from Adlershof, while they still tinker in the West. What a win for the East! Attention! Good evening. Today, the German people's best friend, General Stalin, will be 73 years old. Stalin's name means much to our people. Not a year has passed since 1945 that Stalin and the Soviet people have not done great things for us. I must be going. See you around. You can reach me at the clinic. Think about it: a few years ago it was war and look how far we've come. Where will be in 10, 20 years? Well then, good night. A dance hall just opened near my place. All de-board! So, what do you say? Let's go. Have a seat. Hang on, here we go! Again? Everybody ready? - Mhm. - Let's go. Oopsy-do! Coming through! Can we take a detour? Sure. - Keep driving straight for now. SKOP ' I'll be right back. Looking for someone? Don't the Kesslers live here? Waltraud! What then? - Look here. Antonia? Mother! Where did you come from all the sudden? So many years, Antonia... We had no word of you. Nothing. Do you know how worried we were? Father kept inquiring about you. Right until the end. You could have sent a card at least. Not one letter. Not one line in all those years. They must have stamps in Russia. We didn't know if you were alive. Where were you all this time? When? Three years ago. He was made mayor right after the war. Meetings every day. Constant fighting, because of damned politics. You know how stubborn your father was. Constantly smoking to boot. Always in the kitchen, which still stinks. This is where he died too. I just wanted to ask: What about lunch? Peal a few extra potatoes. None for me. You'll eat with us, won't you? If I'd known you'd come, I'd have butchered a rabbit. With less snow, we could have visited the cemetery. But the graves are all covered. Where were you all this time? Why did we come out here? Someday, I'll explain. Wake up. Come on. When will I see you again? Thanks. Right, left, right, left. Clap, clap, clap, clap- Spin, spin, spin, stand. Your turn. Evenings are the worst. And the holidays. And the weekends. There's not much left over. Everything is broken in here. Broken and bruised. Always making sure not to blurt out some detail. I don't even know who I really am anymore. I love to talk. But when you have to be careful of every word... it drives you crazy. You're the only person I can talk to. If you were ever to leave, I'd... jump out a window. Please, stop. I have no one else. No relatives, no children. We've been through so much. We'll live through this. Did you ever hear from Susanne? Traitor. You know what? I'll give you a key to my place. You come whenever you please. In January, when Lydia goes to school, it'd be nice to have you around. Thank you, Toni. Without you... - Stop. The German Democratic Republic wishes a Happy New Year, it's January 1st, 1953. Well, cheers! To 1953. - To the new year! Who's that? It's a man! He's here to see you. Won't you let him in? I'll be right back, okay? Happy New Year! Happy New Year! There's another man. There was. And he's back? He's dead. An accident. He was an engineer, one of the best. He helped build the world's biggest mill in the Urals. It had to be done ahead of schedule. He hardly slept anymore. He drove off to go deal with an emergency. He dozed off at the wheel. And suddenly... Suddenly, it was all over. I wouldn't be here if you mother hadn't pleaded. This is Mrs. Berger. Coffee? I'll ask one last time. You already know my answer. Why can't you accept my future is here. With her? - Father, please. Perhaps you can talk sense into him, my practice is his for the asking. Three hours by car from here, in Hamburg. Tomorrow it's up for sale. - I care about other things than money! Which you find here? In the Sector? - Yes. Not only I. And it's not the "Sector," it's the "German Democratic Republic." I'll see myself out. Enough, stop! What's this all about? We're fighting to persuade every farmer of the idea of agricultural collectivization. We must put in their heads: "More harvest means a better life!" In 10, 20 years, the farmers will kiss our feet. But we don't have that long. This isn't history's waiting room. Meanwhile you let children romp around on stage! Comrade Ulbricht will be here just in a few weeks to open the GDR's first Agricultural Conference! Do you know what that means? Who came up with this nonsense? The harvest should also be a pleasant... Who is responsible? I am. This is Comrade Berger, the new director. Our builders didn't labor for months day and night to create this palace to host a hunk-Kenn! What were you thinking, comrade? That we optimistically portray... - Yes... May I finish? The Comrade Ulbricht I know from Moscow has a sense of humor. I find this an insult to our Soviet comrades. Music from one of the greatest Soviet composers is used for this triviality. Tchaikovsky was Russian, not Soviet. You, listen up! In two weeks, I demand a celebration worthy of being called one. I say to all here: the Party will not be ridiculed! Got it? Do you understand? I know Schuck, he didn't mean it. He can't stand ballet, just fight songs. Please, understand. I quite liked it. Why didn't you say so? No one needs to stick their neck out for a culture program. People like Schuck aren't the future. Save your strength. Look, people like Schuck... they act like princes of socialism. They'll be long gone. But the old pack of Nazis, back in my beloved Vienna, they're not going anywhere. They've planted their asses firmly in their seats of power... sucking away my air to breathe. Next to them, Schuck is a ridiculous blowhard. Look. Look, the GDR... is like a small child. Barely three years old. It makes plenty of messes. But we must love it, protect it. And someday... it will be a wonderful person. Because it's parents aren't so bad. Right? That's the most important. Look, the comrades aren't always pleased with how I paint. They always want it a bit tamer. But they keep quiet. Because they are happy I'm here, and not in Vienna. Why not buy a tractor, farmer? You could harvest more. I'm not yet rich. Besides, my field is too small. It only goes to the fence. Why not ask your neighbor to join your fields together? Without a fence. - And your neighbor asks his. Silence back there! What is it? From the top! Johanna, remember: don't watch the farmer with schadenfreude. His struggle with the turnip should make you feel sorry. Again! Why not buy a tractor, farmer? You could harvest more. I'm not yet rich. Besides, my field is too small. It only goes to the fence. Why not ask your neighbor to join your fields together? Without a fence. - And your neighbor asks his. Susanne! Lenin's comrade in arms and ideological heir. Amazing, isn't it? The Communist Patty and the Soviet peoples One could get used to this. Stalin. Damn class enemies! Finally! Together with Lenin, Comrade Stalin created the great Communist Party. Nurtured it and formed it. Together with Lenin, Comrade Stalin was the inspiration and leader of the grand socialist October Revolution, the founder of the world's first socialist state. Why do you cry, dear Konrad? Do you know whom you mourn? Not now, Susanne, please. The monster is finally dead. Sooner would have spared a few more lives, a few thousand. To his death! - Stop this! - Cheers! He has no idea about us! - Then tell him! It's all over now, forget the stories. He has no idea. He knows nothing! And we still can't say! Don't you see what a sick life we lead? This is the new world? The new state? Socialism? Who is she? Allow me to introduce myself, Ms. Schumann: convicted spy and Trotskyist, 15 years in the gulag, Soviet Union. - Stop! Irma Seibert, 12 years in the camps for spying. That's enough. 'Cause we signed that drivel? He probably doesn't even know why your husband isn't alive. Shot to death! For visiting his child! Where are you going, SUSE? You can't just leave. We're friends, aren't we? Well, then... I will also be going... See you tomorrow. What is that? What are you doing here? It's awful. I must speak to you. Five minutes, no more. I have an urgent meeting. Can we go to your office? - What's this about? Comrade Berger spent years in the USSR. - That's public record. In a labor camp. Innocent. More than ten years. She told you this? Is it true? Her husband was shot. You don't believe this nonsense? It was right of you to come to me. Stalin's death strengthens our enemies. Now's the time to prove our people have what it takes. We're far from security. Leo, tell me the truth. Is it true? And if it were? Shavings fall beneath the chisel. Konrad, this is just the beginning. Our future lies before us, not the past. If you have questions, come back. I'm here for you. Now, I must go. Silberstein here, get me Comrade Zimmermann. It's urgent. Hello, Hans. It's about Comrade Berger from the House of the People. You ought to take care of this right away. I have coffee and cake. We have to go, now. Lydia has school. This isn't my country, Antonia. What do you mean? I'm going back to Hamburg. Come with me. Are you mad? We'll make a new life together. This is the new life. - That's not true. I'm not going anywhere. Even Why? After all you've suffered? - That's precisely why. Otherwise it was all in vain. All of it. Don't you see that? Who did you see? - Silberstein, to ask if it was true. No school today. I just realized: you've never met your grandma. You bring Lydia to my mother. In the village we went to, you know the house. Ask for Mrs. Kessler. Not a word about what you know. Then you can leave. Good morning. - Morning. You're looking for me? Mrs. Berger? I'll come. I'm Dr. Zeidler, I'm here to take to this sick child for fresh air. We'll see each other soon. When did it start, Konrad, that nothing was right anymore? I don't know. The summer of '68? I remember the writing in Wenceslas Square in Prague: "Lenin, wake up! "The Party has gone mad." But Lenin didn't awake. And your Hamburg was further away than the moon for me. But it began so well. Didn't it? Berger, Antonia? Born April 18th, 1913 in Grijnberg. Public College, stenographer, joined the agit-prop group, the Left Column. All very good. 1938 travel to the Soviet Union. A multi-city tour. 1940 arrest. The charge... - Spying. Please! Don't interrupt me. I know all this. Do you want to repeat this nonsense? - Nonsense? Stalin is dead. Can't we... finally speak freely? Be my guest! But Stalin's death doesn't mean people may spread lies. Or do you really claim that Soviet courts condemned innocent people? I never thought Communists would imprison and shoot comrades. Without cause. Officers, teachers... laborers, doctors... But I saw it. I spent 10 years in a Soviet camp. Where? In a... Look here! I got this in a camp! A wonderful spot in the Thuringia Forest. Blue sky, birds singing, one of Goethe's favorite places. It's right next to Weimar. Buchenwald! That's where they sawed off my leg to research how much pain a man can stand! And the doctor who did it, today, has his own clinic in Stuttgart. I was in a camp! No sitting or lying down until nightfall. In the '30s, they came from everywhere, scientists, engineers, architects, workers, artists to the Soviet Union to help build Communism. Then there was a purge. They all suddenly became spies? I haven't seen your court papers. My trial took five minutes. We cannot blame the USSR for protecting itself against spies. Indeed, Hitler's attack should have convinced you that the Soviet Union was under constant danger. What about the old Bolsheviks? Lenin's original comrades who were murdered? Trotsky, Bukharin? Were they working for the Nazis? I don't know their crimes. But you want me to believe innocent people were murdered there? Just tell me here and now: Who is behind the lies you tell? They didn't sprout in your head! Your father was a Communist. And a mayor! A German Communist, lucky enough to survive the worst of all wars in the Soviet Union. And you have nothing better to do than smear the name of the country that you owe your life to'? Why? I have a report from your neighbor. On the 5th of March, you had a friendly get together. On the very day that the whole world mourned the death of Stalin, you've got nothing better to do than toast with an enemy journalist? I'll give you some time alone. You wanted to see me? What do I have to do to get out of here? Hold yourself to the statement you signed. You said a time would come when we could talk about it. Not now. When, if not now? No one denies you've suffered. Why am I here? You are here because your Party suspects it cannot trust you. Worse yet, you do nothing to disprove the suspicion. Should we stand by and watch comrades turn on us? Watch the West turn back the clock? Damned capitalism! The very existence of the GDR cost us Communists much blood. But in vain? But the tru... - The truth is what supports our cause! By the way, Zeidler doesn't work at the hospital anymore. At least not ours. He changed sides. Hamburg. That's the result. He probably couldn't handle it. Your truth. I'm sorry. I will speak with Comrade Schuck. Great changes are afoot. The conference was postponed. Ulbricht decided to rename Filrstenberg. To Stalinstadt. It's a great honor and you can imagine the work before us. We need everyone. But not at any price. Mommy! Now, we can start over. Translation: Jacob Watson
