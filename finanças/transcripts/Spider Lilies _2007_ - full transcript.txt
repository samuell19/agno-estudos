How did you find it in the dark? It's fluorescent, so different from other materials. Grandma, I love you. You're...stupid. We can stop here. It's over? Why it is so fast today? We can stop here today. Is it a tatoo knife? It's not a knife, but tattoo machine. And... if I become fat, will my tattoo change shape? Will it distort like this? And... I want this golden flower. How is it? Sorry. Why not? This flower, it's the path to hell. Hell? It's Manjusaka. (Manjusaka: Buddhism word, means "the connection between the real world and the nether world") But...

[I want to hear the first sex experience of a little girl.] I wasn't even 10 years old when I first fell in love. [Silence: such a liar.] It's true! I was just over 9 years old at that time.

Did you change styles? No. I think this uniform is pretty. Did you browse my Blog? I've been busy. No time to get online. You're really that busy? If you have spare time, you should view it. If you have the will, you can find some time. Honestly, I don't like going online Really? I was thinking that, after you see my Blog, we can discuss tattoos together If you're impatient, You can find someone else [Silence: Hello, what's your story today?] I am in no mood. Everyone, either we go directly to a private session or nothing [300 points, private session, ok?] When she starts to strip, press these two buttons to record. Don't forget to ask her if she wants to meet, and how much Hurry up and entrap her Don't take too long [Wait!] What's up? [Don't strip, I just want to chat] But 300 points are not cheap.

[So, you went into this cam video business by yourself?] That's right! I like to do this. [Aren't you afraid of meeting some bad guys on line?] I wont I'm in my own home, it's impossible to meet bad guys. And the internet is virtual and false. If I like,then I go on line; If I don't like, then I get off. Sometimes I am shouted at by Sister Chong. And Sister Chong is also a false person. I never see her. [Sister Chong?] Sister Chong is the web manager and my boss. [and, am I false?] If... You remember me and I remember you... Then it shouldn't be considered false. [Does your first love remember you?] Of course they remember It is so hard to meet her Let me tell you... She designed a tattoo for me. And she told me...she would tattoo that design on my body... And I will show it to you, ok? [You always...have day dreams like this?] Day dreams? It's not a day dream. I have a good memory. [9 year-old memory is not trustworthy.] It's true! 9 years old? You can't trust memories from when you were 9 It's true! Who...who are you? Why don't you trust me? [Memories often lie, especially for yourself.] What do you mean?

[Traps are everywhere on the internet.] [I admit that I've been watching you] [But I can't tell who I am.] I can't stand you, Why are you acting so shy and mysterious [I care about you.] So...you were feeling jealous! [Sometimes...] [It's my last request] [Please leave this place] Then...why should I have to listen to you? [Because I...] [I really love Jade, I hope you can be happy.] Because... I really love you... I hope you can be happy! Wow...cool knives! Aren't they cool? Takeko is such a genius! I'm finding some time to try these kniveies! Isn't she here? She told me not to bother her. What do you want her for? Yeah, I come here to make sure about something. Make sure... whether she will do the tattoo for me. She has been working on the picture all day. She is very easy to get upset! What picture? Some...some damned boring flowers Really? To be honest, she loses her temper easily these days. I thought she didn't have periods. You bet! She's totally a tomboy, Extremely serious when she's working on her pictures. She doesn't have femininity at all. She is not tough and she still pretends to be cool like that. And she is unsociable and eccentric. She just thinks that she is a real man! Yeah! What's all that noise! Jade... Are you busy now? Adong said you were working on the drawings. Yes, it's yours. Wow...really? It's my picture! You do not understand yet. Tattoos are painful, I am telling you. Generally speaking, men are scared to pain more than women. It's not true. When should I come? tomorrow? It's not that urgent. It's Frday Ok for you? Ok, then I will come on Friday. Friday... You came late today and yesterday. You didn't show up until the head called us to sleep. Sorry, because of the drawings. Is this it? Wow, it's so nice. I think I have new story to listen to. A customer wanted my tattoo... But you didn't agree with it. So...I changed to draw this jasmine pattern. Why don't you tell me a story ... anything will do. You haven't told me story for a long time. Then I'll tell you the story of when you were young I have no story. Everyone has a story. Only that, you've forgotten yours. Why are you waiting here? Go to sleep now. I'm scared of sleeping by myself. Ching is grown up now. Please have a little courage, ok? No, don't leave me alone. I'm not leaving you alone. I'm just...going to study at my classmate's No...No... You always say no. Ching is not a good child. I don't like you any more. I will not spoil you like mom! Bad sister...bad sister... Bad sister. Why are you ignoring me? That night... Was everything that happened between us false? Takeko, look at me. That night... I shouldn't have left my brother alone. He can't recognize me now. It wasn't your fault! If I was with him, the result might have been different. It was all an accident. You shouldn't say this. It wasn't our fault! Why? I can't understand your story... Why...why is today's story so weird? It's only a story. Don't think too much. My head hurts. Takeko. Why do I feel... You are angry with me. I'm not. Don't think too much. Go back to sleep. Jade. This is mine? It's yours. It's jasmine! So it's not that Manjusaka. This was drawn for you You drew it for me :) I understand. This is what should be considered my tattoo of love. It's only a tattoo. No, it's love. I told you before, I need a tattoo of love. Afterwards, you drew these jasmines for me. It's only a tattoo. You have too many illusions! What do you mean? Is it my illusion? Or do you conceal yourself too much! Otherwise I will spell it out. You thought if you log in my Blog anonymously, and I won't know who you are. I know it's you, why don't you admit the truth? I don't understand. Whether you despise me, or if you're too afraid to face your own feelings. I'm sorry. Why do you remember all these things? How about you? You choose to forget? I don't. Tell me the story of your tattoo... The tattoo on the wall, it isn't real, is it? This is my dad. After he died, My brother could not recognise anything All he could recognise was this tattoo. The doctor said my brother lost his memory of everything Please, give me the same tattoo pattern as my dad had. So...this is why you got it They are the most important people in my life. Where is your mom? Did she return home? She will never return. Are you still mad at her? Really? Mom, do you really miss me? When you come home next time, where will you take me to play? Tokyo? Is it Disney land? Ok! Ok! She doesn't remember me. Just like you. So... I always have illusions. people are all around me. Will you remember me? Hold me. Hello, cam video lovers.
