Jack, where are you? I need your opinion. Jack? All right. Which one? Now think sexy. - Well if you're after sexy, I would stop right there. - No, not that sexy. - Well, how sexy do you have to look to work for a courier agency? - I am going to an audition, Jack. I just wanna pull out all the stops. - Honey, you're a great actress. I don't think you have to run around half naked to get a part. - Yeah, well, it doesn't seem to matter how good an audition I give. I am not getting a break. - They told me not to marry an actress because the drama never stops at the stage door. - What is that supposed to mean? - It means I want you to relax. Have faith in yourself. You'll get a part soon. - Yeah well, I have lost the last six parts I tried out for. My career has ground to a halt. - Honey, it's a tough business. You know that. Just keep on trying. - Oh god, you know what? You don't even understand, Jack. - I don't understand? Because I'm only an accountant? Is that it? I got a novel in there that is half finished. It's not getting written because I gotta put on a damn suit everyday and get out there and make sense of other people's screwed up finances. Well, quite frankly, our finances are almost non-existent. - Yeah well nobody's stopping you from writing. - Just the 50 hours a week I have to put in the office and the fact when I come home I hardly see straight. - Yeah well, I work too. - Part time job at a courier agency barely takes care of the phone bill. - That is not fair! - You know what? The next time you start feeling sorry for yourself remember you're not the only one who's feeling frustrated here. - Oh, come on, Jack. - I'll see you at dinner. (Nora scoffs) - This day's starting off well. (scoffs) (boat horn honks) (sirens wailing) (phones ringing) - Let me run that, sir. Pick up 505 Madison Ave. Package on the 767 Third Avenue, Suite 1209. That'll be 40 minutes. Thank you. Bad day to come in late, girl. The phones have been lit up like my Uncle George at a Christmas party. - I'm sorry, Clara. I can't catch a break today. - Hey gorgeous. - Hey! - How's Aerolitic's own gift to Broadway this morning, eh? - Well, I got an audition this afternoon. So I am very nervous. - Oh, come on. A director would be crazy not to choose you. I keep telling you, you look like Rita Hayworth when she did "Gilda". You are gonna be a big star, kid. - Yeah well, I wish there were a few more directors out there who felt the same way you do. (Nora sighs) What's with you today, anyway? You look different. - I am different. I woke up this morning and I had the feeling. First time since Evelyn died. - You know, Bill, I don't think I wanna hear about this. - No, no, no. I ain't talking about that. I'm talking about the feeling. Like today's my lucky day. Every time that feeling came on, something good always happened. We'd get a check in the mail or Evelyn would buy a lottery ticket and we'd win a few bucks. But there was always something good coming. I've already bought my lottery ticket for today's drawing. - Oh. - It's gonna be a big one. They haven't had a winner in six weeks and it's up to 13.5 mill. - Wow. That'd be some nice Christmas presents. - Tell me about it. Listen, Nora, you and Jack, well you've been the closest thing to family I've had in the last couple of years. So, whatever I win, you're gonna see a piece of it. (Nora laughs) - Well, forgive me if I don't hold my breath, huh? - Oh yeah, you go ahead and laugh but you know what? I think you should touch my sleeve. Maybe some of my good luck will rub off on you on your audition today. - All right. Oh yeah, I feel lucky. - Oh, this is gonna be one sweet I told you so, good looking. - Hey, if you're still lucky, here's your morning deliveries. Shouldn't be too tough a schlep. Everything's midtown. - Well, lucky me. Hey, see what I'm telling you? It's starting already. Keep smiling, gorgeous. (Bill whistling) - I've listened to that man's whistling every time he leaves the office for the last 10 years. You would think he would update his songs by now. - Well, hey, I like those old show tunes. Anyway, he's Irish-Italian. Very theatrical. That's why we love him. - Maybe that's why you love him. (Nora laughs) - Aerolitic Express Messengers, how can I help you? (sirens wailing) When did you think it was over, Alec? No, help me out here 'cause I really wanna know. Did you wake up one day and that was it? Or was it more gradual? I just wasn't so charming or flawless or young anymore. Oh? Because I know exactly when I stopped loving you. Like one of those moments when the world's caught in a flash of lightning and the image is seared onto your brain. I remember walking through that door, putting down my bags, and looking into your eyes. Well, of course I didn't know her name right then, but I saw her there just the same. You weren't even looking at me anymore. - Oh wow. (claps) Bravo. Excellent performance. I'm sure it would wow moms and pops at dinner theaters all over the suburbs. But you see, what we require here is a professional. One with subtly, intelligence, and training. (tense music) Make a note of that. Could somebody here, please, just make a note of that so that I don't have to waste anymore of my life listening to this? Well? Next. - Hey, you know what? That was not a dinner theater performance. I know this part and I have worked very hard on it. - Oh. Well, obviously not hard enough. - Look, I haven't worked with you before so I don't know what your problem is, but I saw your last two plays and may I respectfully suggest you deal with it instead of dumping on other people's talent and hard work? Thank you so much for your time. - Next! (Nora sighs) - Unbelievable. Hmm, there goes my acting career. - Hey, somebody had to tell him. Last time I auditioned for him, he told me I'd be perfect if he were casting a bad biker movie. (Nora laughs) Look, once what you did gets around, they'll probably give you an award. - Why do we do this to ourselves, Kristen, why? - It's showbiz, girl. And for the glamor, of course. (Nora laughs) Hey, you wanna grab a coffee? - Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I wanna go home and make something special for Jack tonight. My nerves kinda got the better of me this morning. - And he got the worst. - Yeah, something like that. Anyway, I wanna make it up to him. - [Director] Next! (woman sobbing) - [Nora And Kristen] Let's get out of here. (Nora and Kristen laughing) - You were great. Forget him. You're gonna be fine. (Nora humming) (singing in foreign language) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Bill] Hi Nora, I told you so. - Hey Bill. What are you talking about? - I told you this was gonna be my lucky day and it was. Only bigger than I figured. - So you finally got the lady in 216 to go out with you, huh? - Oh, come on. It's bigger than that. I'm being serious here, Nora. - Well tell me. What is it? - No, I wanna tell you in person. - You won some money on the lottery, didn't you? - Uh-uh. I'm not saying anything else. I wanna see your face when I tell you. Listen, how about I come over for dinner, huh? - Uh, Bill, you know, I don't think that's such a great idea. - Oh, come on. I promise I won't stay long and I'll bring the wine. I really have to celebrate this with ya. - Oh, all right then. Come on over. Hope you like penne alla vodka - Well, I prefer pasta. Well, listen, anything you're making that's fine with me. (Nora laughs) And Nora, whatever we eatin', make sure you got a chair behind you 'cause when I tell you my news it's gonna knock you right off your feet. - So you really did win big, huh? - Big? Listen, on my way home I'm gonna stop at the cafe on 28th and I'm gonna lay down a bet or two. After what happened today I don't need another win. But listen, when you're running this hot, why not keep it rolling, right? - Well, I guess. Now you got me really curious. I wanna hear this. - Uh-uh, you're gonna have to be patient. Listen, I only got a couple more deliveries and then I'll be over, okay? How about 7:00 o'clock? Bye, gorgeous. - All right, bye. Okay. (Bill laughs) - Oh man, oh man. Oh. Thanks Evelyn! (Bill whistling) (thunder rumbling) (sirens wailing) (tense music) (thunder crashing) Hey. I didn't expect to see you so soon. So what are you doing here? (phone ringing) (singing in foreign language) - [Jack] Hi, this is Jack Barkin. I'm out of the office right now but if you leave a message I'll call you back as soon as I can. (phone beeps) - Hi, Jack, it's me. It's 8:30. I got dinner ready. Look, I hope there's nothing wrong. Call me if you get this, okay? Bye. (horns honking) (thunder crashing) (tense music) Hey sweetheart. I was getting worried about you. - The subway was shut down. I couldn't catch a cab in the rain. - Oh god, you're soaking wet. Here, let me, let me just take this. Got it. Ew. Oh sweetheart, look. I'm really sorry about this morning. I was just so nervous about my audition and when I got there I practically ripped the guy's head off. So, needless to say, I don't think I got the job. You okay? - Walking 20 blocks in the rain took the edge off my enthusiasm. - Ah, yeah. Well look, I made us a really nice dinner. We're having penne alla vodka - Oh, a romantic dinner for three? - Yeah, well I set a place for Bill. Look, apparently something really big happened and he wanted to come over and tell me. I promise I won't let him stay long. - It's fine. - What's the matter, Jack? - Nothing. Too much work. Too much stress, I guess. - All right then. Tell you what. We are not gonna wait for Bill. Tonight there are no audits, no phone calls, no responsibilities, besides complimenting the chef, of course. So please take a seat, sir. Dinner will be served shortly. (sirens wailing) (horns honking) - Hey guys. - Hey. Yeah, looks good. (phones ringing) - Aerolitic Express Messenger. Please hold. Aerolitic Express Messenger, please hold. It's starting already. You know what we need around here? Five more messengers and a rocket car or two. - Have you seen Bill yet this morning? - That's part of the problem. Hasn't shown up yet. - You tried his place? - No answer. Been trying since 7:00. - Yeah, I've been trying too. You know, he didn't turn up to dinner last night? - I've been working here 10 years and he hasn't missed a day that I've seen. I mean, I don't know what it would take to put him out of action or to miss a meal. - I know, neither do I. Aerolitic Express Messengers. How can I help you? - Normally I wouldn't do this, Nora. But seeing as you're pretty well family to Bill, I figure it's okay. - I really appreciate it, thank you. And he didn't pick up his newspaper either. - I'm telling you, I don't think he came back last night at all. I didn't see him. Plus, he usually stops in and takes old Mrs. Clinger's shihtzu out for a walk before he turns in and he never showed up. (baby crying) (Nora sighs) (dog barks) - You know, he didn't turn up to work and he hasn't checked in. Now I'm getting really worried about him. Is there anybody else he might've stayed with? - Lady, you're the closest thing he's got to family I've seen. If you don't know where he is, I don't know who would. - Oh boy. (soft music) What about this? No. (Nora chuckles) - For what it's worth, I hope the old guy's okay. He's got a good heart. Always helping someone. There's not a whole lot left like him. You know what I mean? - Yeah, I know. (sirens wailing) Look, I realize that he hasn't been gone very long. It's just that it's not like him. This is a guy who hasn't missed a day of work in years and he never showed up to his apartment last night or this morning. - Your friend a drinker? - Yeah, he has a drink now and then. Look, he's not a drunk. - No. You said he thought this was his lucky day, right? So, maybe he did win a few bucks and he decided to celebrate. - No. It's just not Bill. - Maybe he met a lady and he's still celebrating. (Nora laughs) - Detective, he's almost 70 years old. - Well, men still celebrate at that age. Or so I'm told. - You're not even beginning to take this seriously, are you? - No, what I think is you're taking it too seriously. - Look, he's my friend and he said that he was on his way over to my apartment to celebrate with me and my husband and he never showed up and he didn't go home. - Look, ma'am, ma'am, I told you I can't take a report yet. You know, after 48 hours elapses, then you give me a call and we'll take action, okay? - Okay. - In the meantime, you might wanna try a few things to find him yourself. Like figuring out who was the last person to see him yesterday. Would you know who that would be? - Well nobody at his apartment. - Ah. - Might've been one of his deliveries. - Ah, there you go. You see? Maybe one of those people remembers something he said about where he was going, what he was doing, you know. - Yeah, thanks detective. I'll give it a try. - Oh, and Miss Barkin? - Mm-hmm. - I would keep it low-key, huh? I mean, he's only gone for a night, you know? You don't wanna alarm people. - And what if something did happen to him? - Well now, if something did happen to him, well that's a whole different ballgame now. Then it's my job. (Nora sighs) - Mm-hmm. Yeah, okay. - [Woman] Right away, we need them. - Hey Marinello. Nice to see the flakes wind up at your desk for once. - Oh yeah? Who said she's a flake? - When someone comes to us to track down dinner guests, I do. - Well, maybe this dinner guest is really in trouble. (partner laughs) Keep your mind open. You might even learn how to solve a case one day. - Yeah. Hey, thanks for the advice. (Marinello laughs) - [Jack] You went where? - The police. Look, Bill is missing. I just want someone to help me find him. - What are you talking about? A man misses dinner and you're turning it into a major crime scene? - Jack, this is not just dinner. He has disappeared. He never came to work this morning and he didn't go home last night. - That's not our problem. - He's our friend. Of course it's our problem. - Well, he must have family somewhere. (Nora sighs) - We are all he's got. You know that. Jack, I just asked the police to look into his disappearance. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? - I'm not. I just think they're busy people. You just can't walk in there and treat the police like some lost and found. You gonna look stupid. - What, I'm stupid to care about a friend? - I didn't say that. - Oh, so caring about a friend isn't stupid. It's just me that's stupid. - I didn't say that either. - You know what? You can be very insensitive. - And you're not being sensible. Calling out the Marines because some guy blew off a dinner engagement. Oh honey, I didn't mean to upset you. - Yeah well, for somebody who isn't trying, you're doing a very good job. - Look, he'll turn up. Can you see anything that could keep that old guy down? I just don't want you to go off on some wild goose chase when the guy's probably just fine. He wouldn't want you to worry either. You know that. (tense music) Tell you what. Why don't you choose a wine while I finish up here? - Okay. (upbeat music) Would you listen to yourself, Kristen? Maybe Jack has a point? Bill has no one else in the world to worry about him and I'm supposed to beat myself up for caring? I don't think so. - Look, I'm just saying, things are tense between the two of you and you obsessing about Bill is the last thing your relationship needs. - I am not obsessing. This isn't about our relationship. This is about Bill. - Okay, I know, you're right. There's nothing you can do about it right now anyway. The police aren't getting involved. - Well, the detective I spoke to said I should follow up on my own. - Oh, right. I hate to break this to you, but you're an actress not a private's detective. - Yeah well, I played one three years ago, did a ton of research, fabulous reviews. - Yeah, and I researched being the Queen of France. Doesn't mean they gave me no crown. - Look, all I'm gonna do is look at the people Bill might've seen the day he disappeared and ask them a few questions. - Oh, like what? Excuse me, my friend vanished into thin air. Did he tell you he was thinking of vanishing? - Isn't funny, Kristen. - That's what they said at my audition for "Little Murders" at the Shubert. - Ha, ha, ha. Bill said he was right about his lucky day and that he'd own big. - What, the lottery? How much? - I don't know, just big. - Nora, just 'cause he said it-- - He also said it was my lucky day and guess what? Remember that audition I did? The director phoned, I got a call back. - Oh please. That was talent, not luck. - Bill said that he had a lucky feeling and I think he won. - Okay, so say he won. So what? - Well, you know how Bill loves to talk. He was so excited. Maybe he talked about it to the wrong person. - Oh, hold up. I don't like where this is going. So you're saying someone did something to him to get a lottery ticket? - It's possible. If Bill was okay, he'd have been at my place the other night and he'd have been at work the next morning. At the very least, he would've called me, right? - What are you planning to do? - Well, I put together a list of the deliveries Bill made on Monday afternoon. I'm gonna go visit them one by one and try to get a feel of who he might've talked to about it being his lucky day. - Nora, if you're right about this, the person you're looking to find might be some psycho freak killer. I mean, has that had any impact on you at all? - Yes, the thought had crossed my mind but I think I can get what I need without setting off any alarm bells. - Oh, really? - Well, that's the theory anyway. I guess I'm gonna find out how good an actor I really am, huh? - I guess. (jazzy music) - I'm afraid Mr. Barach is busy. Can I connect you to the other Mr. Barach? Thank you. Can I help you? - This may seem like a really odd question but my dad is a courier and he made a delivery here Monday afternoon and well, he's getting very forgetful, so when he got home he wasn't wearing his cap and he thought that he maybe left it here. - Sorry, but nobody turned in anything like that. - You sure? It was a Derek Jeter souvenir. - I straighten up here every night at closing. If it was here, I'd have known about it. - Look, I know you're really busy and I don't mean to bother you, it's just my sister gave him this cap last Christmas and if she finds out he's lost it she's gonna go crazy. Maybe if you could remember whether or not he was wearing it when he came in, I might be able to figure out at what point in the day he lost it. - Have I seen you somewhere before? - Uh, no, I don't think so. - I mean, not like this, but are you like on television or something? You an actor? - Yeah, yeah I'm an actor. - Oh yeah, I know. Onstage last year, off Broadway, "Driven by the Rain." - My god, you saw that? - Yeah, it was a really weird play but you were really good. - Yeah well, that was a tough one. Boy did the writing suck but the cast was very good. - Wow. It's not everyday we get a real live celebrity here. - Well, hardly. So, do you think you remember him? - We get a lot of messengers in here. What did your dad look like? - He's five foot six, graying hair, whistles, always show tunes. - Hey, I remember that guy. Yeah, he's been in here a couple times. Came in here mid afternoon, dropped off some documents from the courthouse. To tell you the truth, I can't remember if he had a hat on or-- - Well, did you talk to him at all? - No, I was on the phone when he came in. I just signed the receipts and then he left. - And could anyone else have talked to him? - No, door to my desk and then out. - Okay. Well, thank you anyway. - Well, it was really nice to meet you. - Thank you. - Listen, could I get your autograph? - Yeah, sure. (Nora laughs) - I hope you find the hat. You're always welcome to come back and it might turn up. - That's very kind of you. Thank you. - Thank you. (gentle music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey Nora, are you okay? - Yeah. It's just turning into a long day. - Any luck? - Well, if you call three don't remember hims, getting kicked out of another two offices, and nearly having to buy a squeaky clean used low-mileage car a success, then no. - Girl, why don't you just go home? - Oh, I don't know. I think I'll try a couple more on the way home. Way home. But of course! Bill said he was going to his bookmaker on the way home. Now, who better to tell about how lucky he felt, right? - Bookmakers? Okay, that is not a good idea. - Yeah, and who better to try and steal someone's lottery ticket? - Yeah, and who better to throw your butt in the trunk of a car for sticking her nose where it don't belong? - Hey, forget about it. (Kristen chuckles) Don't worry, I'll be careful. - Nora, I can't stop you from doing this, but you definitely can't stop me from worrying either. - One more stop and then I'm going home. I'll call you later, okay? Oh, and Kristen? - What? - Thanks for worrying. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Nora] Bye. - Bye. (tense music) (horns honking) (sirens wailing) - [Man] Taxi! - We should go soon. All right, listen up. We're getting ready to move. On the signal, Terry and me go in the front. Unit two, cover the alley. - [Officer] You got it. - Aw man. Did you put mustard on my sandwich? - You said you wanted mustard on your sandwich. - I didn't ask for mustard. Why would I ask for mustard? I hate mustard. - Hey. Check it out. What do you figure that's all about? - I don't know. But whatever she'd doing, we don't need it right now. - Hi there. I was hoping you might be able to help me with something. - Depends. - Well, my dad came in here on Monday afternoon and I was wondering if you might've seen him. - Well, a lot of guys come by here, lady. - Yeah, well his name is Bill Reagan. - A lot of guys don't introduce themselves. - He's about five foot six, graying hair. - Oh, you just described about half the guys who come in here. - Yeah, well. Oh, also he whistles. He comes in here a lot. No? - I'm sorry, lady. - Don't turn away from me. I'm talking to you. This is important. Look, my family is really worried. I just need to know if you've seen him. Please? - You think it's a tip off? - I'd feel a whole lot better if we made our move five minutes ago. This is starting to stink. - Nobody saw your father and nobody knows anything about him. (Nora sighs) - All right. - What the hell is this now? (timer beeping) - That's our cue. Police, freeze! - Away from the counter, now. Terry, go. - [Officer] Stay down! (door crashing) - [Terry] Step away from the computer now. Open the cage. - You know anything about computers? Because mine just crashed. Wiped the whole hard drive. Can I put my hands down now? (dramatic music) (Nora gasps) - That's far enough, little lady. You're not going anywhere. - I keep trying to tell you, I don't understand what you're talking about. I didn't warn anybody about anything. - Right. And that's how come you started training for the Olympic hurdles when Detective Miller was trying to question you. - Well, how am I supposed to know he's a detective? Look, no offense, but he looks more like something out the road company version of "Wise Guys" than a cop. He could've identified himself. - Well, consider me identified. Now how about telling us what you were doing in that betting parlor? - I was looking for a friend. - A pretty girl like you has to look for friends in a place like that? - No, that is not what I meant. A friend of mine disappeared a couple of days ago. - So what? You started making bets about what happened to him? - No. The detective I talked to suggested that I go to the places he may have visited the day he disappeared and figure out who was the last person to talk to him. - Which detective? - Well, detective... Oh, Marinello. Detective Marinello, he works here. The last thing my friend said is that he was going there to place a bet. - You wanna tell Marinello to get over here now? - Sure. - You can get out of here if you want. (phones ringing) (people chattering) - What's going on? - You know her? - Yeah, she stopped by yesterday in missing persons. - Yeah well, following your advice, three months of work on a bookmarking operation just got blown off when she walked into the shop. - I didn't advise her to go in there. What are you talking about? - That's not what she says and that's not what's going in my report. I'll leave you two to get reacquainted. - Oh look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to get you into trouble. - I'll survive. What the hell were you doing in that place? - Well, it's just I remember Bill told me that that's where he was going on his way to my place and I wanted to ask if they'd seen him. - All right. So you asked around, right? Now you're finished. - What? I don't know. Guess that depends if we find Bill, huh? - We? Hey Miss Barkin, you're not getting it here now. Come on. - I am not gonna sit at home and wait while my friend is out there somewhere hurt or worse, with nobody trying to help him. - Look, I'll prepare a report on your friend if he doesn't show up by morning. But as of now, you're no longer in the detective business. You understand that? - No, the only thing that I understand is my friend is missing and so far nobody's doing a damn thing about it! Am I free to go? - Oh, please. - Well, thank you. (phones ringing) (tense music) - Yeah, I got it. (Nora sighs) - What do you expect me to say? I come home, you're not here. There's no message, no call, nothing. And when you finally call you're at the police station. - Well, it was just a misunderstanding. - Which wouldn't have happened if you hadn't been sticking your nose into something the police should be handling. - Yeah well, they're not. Nobody is except me and Bill is still missing. - I don't wanna hear it. Nora, I'm busting my chops everyday out there trying to stay ahead of the credit card companies and you running around aggravating the police department. - I'm just worried about Bill. - Well worry about us for a change. Nora, I think you're mixing up your priorities big time here. - That is not fair. - Oh funny. That's what I keep saying. I remember the times when the two of us were all we worried about. You know the big plans that we had, how we're gonna work together, how we're gonna make it all happen. - Nothing has changed. Those plans are still there. - I don't know. Are they? I have to get some writing done, keep up my part of the plan. (Nora sighs) (upbeat music) - This is choice. You stir up a nest of seasoned criminals, the police tell you to stop, Jack tells you to stop, and here you are planning to get right back into trouble. - Well, what do you want me to do? Just give up? - Given what's happened so far, that's not a bad idea. Nora, Bill might be missing but you're gonna wind up in the hospital or worse. - So I'll be more careful. - Don't say that. To be more careful suggests that you're not being careful in the first place. What you're being is reckless. - Okay, so I'll be less reckless then. - I'm not gonna win this, am I? Nora, this is real life. It's not a play. - I'm going to do this. I have two more places to go and then my detective career's history, okay? I'll see you later. - Bye. (upbeat jazzy music) - Nora. - Oh, hey Chrissy. How you doing? What are you doing here? - I'm just waiting for my Grandma. We're going shopping and then we're gonna go to-- (concrete thuds) (dramatic music) (Nora yelps) - Oh my god. - [Chrissy] Are you okay? - Yeah. - Grandma, that nearly killed her. - You're sure you're all right? - Yeah, I'm fine, really. Wow, that was lucky, huh? - You gotta be careful, dear. Don't push it. Anyone's luck can turn on a dime. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - And an unlucky day can be a killer. (Nora laughs) - You bet. - You take care of yourself. - Be careful. - Okay, bye. - Bye. (tense music) - Wow. (horns honking) (sirens wailing) (people chattering) (phones ringing) - Stormwatch Insurance. No, he's not here right now. Can I take a message? Uh-huh. Yeah, okay, got it. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, I wondered if you could help me with something. - That's what I'm here for. - My dad is courier and he delivered a package to your office Monday afternoon and somewhere along the way he lost his favorite cap. (phone rings) I was-- - Hold please. - I was just wondering if maybe he'd left it here or if you'd remember him wearing it when he came in. - Refresh my memory. What's he look like? - He's five foot six, graying hair, very talkative. If he'd started you wouldn't have been able to shut him up. (Nora laughs) Oh, also he whistles. - Oh, yeah. The whistler. - Uh-huh. - I remember him. He's a really sweet guy. Don't remember the cap though. Anyway, the guy he was talking to isn't here right now but he might remember. - So he was talking to someone? - Yeah, oh. (phone beeps) Are you still holding? I'll put you through. Yes, the package he brought in was data for the accountant who was working on the audit with Mr. Moore. - Oh. - Your dad got all excited when he find out the guy was here. So, I sent him back to talk to him. - An accountant? - Yeah, he's with Lyon's and Becker. - Oh? Do you remember the name of this accountant? - Yeah, I do. He was pretty cute. Half the girls in the office had him scoped out five minutes after he cleared the door. His name's Jack Barkin. (tense music) - Uh. So, they talked? My dad and this Jack Barkin? - Yeah. Your dad said he had something important to tell him. So, I sent him right back there. They were there for a while so I guess they talked. - Penny, have you seen the universal life annuity payout schedule for last month? - No, I haven't. But I am gonna go and check in the um-- - Files. - Files. Right. Okay. Oh, this is Mr. Moore. Jack Barkin was doing the audit with him. So he might be able to help you. Good luck. - Thank you. - Oh. (Penny giggles) - You know Jack? - Well, actually I'm his wife. - Oh well, this is a surprise. How can I help you? - I just had a question about when Jack was working here the other day. You see, a friend of ours is a courier and he made a delivery here that day and I was just wondering if he'd left his cap here. - Couriers usually don't get past reception. - No, I know. It's just your receptionist said that he went in the back. - Yeah. Yeah, I think I do remember a guy going back to where Jack was working. An older guy I think. What did your husband say? - Well, I haven't been able to talk to him about it yet. I will. Thank you. - Mm-hmm. - Hey buddy, go. Go, go long. Well? Go get it, Jerry. We don't got all day. (boy laughs) I swear to god, man. Oh, I can't catch. (boy scoffs) Jerry, what's going on down there, dude? You find a girlfriend? (boys laughing) (tense music) - You sure you're okay for this? I mean, they could try your husband again. Maybe he's home. - No, no. Let's just do this, all right? - Okay. (tense music) - Oh god, Bill. (Nora crying) - [Marinello] That's him? - Yeah. - Mrs. Barkin, I'm sorry. - Yeah well, thank you very much, detective. It's very touching but it's just way too late. - Look, I know you're angry because we weren't looking for your friend sooner. - You weren't looking for him at all. - The coroner says he's been dead at least 48 hours. - Well what happened? - Coroner says there were no outward signs of trauma. He looks like a heart attack. - And when will they know for sure? - Well, if it was his heart, there'd be no reason for an autopsy. - What? - Miss Barkin, he was an elderly man who'd just been walking up and down stairs all day. I mean, there's no suspected foul play here. - No, that man was as healthy as a horse. - Look, come on. Let's get out of here. Come on, come on. Please. - What about the ticket? Did you find his ticket? - What ticket? - Look, when I talked to him that morning he said it was his lucky day. He bought a lottery ticket and then he called me later to tell me that he was right. Look, I told you. He was coming by my place that evening to fill me in on his good luck. - There was no ticket. - Don't you think that that might be reason enough to believe that he was robbed and then murdered for it? - Whoa, whoa. When we found Bill, his wallet was still in his pocket and he still had some money in it and he was still wearing his watch and his ring. That doesn't sound like a robbery to me. - Yeah well, I think that somebody knew about his lottery win and stole it from him. - All right. How much did he say he won? - Well, he didn't exactly. - He didn't say? - No. - And you expect me to open a homicide investigation based on the suggestion that he might've had a winning lottery ticket and you don't know how much it was for or if he cashed it or if someone else knew about it? - I think that somebody did know about it. - Listen, I feel for you losing your friend like this but I have a board full of real homicides with real victims and real motives waiting for me back at the office. Now if you can think of anything that would support your theory, I'll be glad to hear it. Otherwise, I don't have time to investigate every accidental death that comes by the precinct. (Marinello sighs) - We done here? - Do me a favor, will you? Ask the coroner to do a once over on Bill Reagan's body. - It was natural causes. - Mm. Tell him to look at it again, will you? I got some new information. - Am I missing something here? When did this woman start to become credible? - When the guy she was worried about ended up in that cooler. In my book, that's credible. - Enough to open an investigation? - We'll see. We'll see after the autopsy comes back. - We're investigating, aren't we? I know we are. I can tell. (sirens wailing) (soft music) (Nora sighs) - Jack. - Hey. What's the matter? - The police called. They found Bill. - Is he okay? - He's dead, Jack. - Oh my god. That's terrible. I'm sorry, honey. I never thought. - Jack, when did you last see Bill? - Why do you ask? - I was just wondering. - I don't know. It must've been here a couple of weeks ago. We watched an old movie after dinner. - And you haven't seen him since then? Well, I mean not even in passing? Maybe downtown or something? - Nora, what are you getting at? (Nora sighs) - I'm just trying to put some pieces together, that's all. - Honey, you've been through a lot. Why don't you sit down? I'll fix you a drink. - Oh boy. - [Kristen] You didn't tell him you knew? - He said he didn't see Bill that day. - And the guy at the insurance company said he did. - Well, what am I supposed to do? Accuse him of lying? Maybe he forgot. - Being the last person to see a friend on the day he died isn't exactly the kind of thing that just slips somebody's mind. There's gotta be a reason he didn't tell you he saw Bill. Come on. - Yeah, I know. I know you're right. You know, that night he came home late and he was soaking wet. When I asked him where he'd been, he said he had to walk home 'cause he couldn't get a cab in the rain. - Hmm. - What is going on, Kristen? - I don't know. But if the police do decide to investigate, they could easily put the facts together and that could make trouble. - Well, like what? - Well, if Jack was the last person to see Bill alive, did Bill tell him about the lottery ticket? Probably. So Bill crosses through the park and he dies or is murdered. If he's murdered, whoever did it knows exactly what they were looking for. - Kristen, this is my husband we're talking about. - Yeah but if Bill was killed, the killer was probably waiting for him and who came home late and was soaking wet? - Oh my god. - Nora, I'm sorry. This is crazy. I'm treating this like some dumb murder mystery I'm auditioning for. I shouldn't be saying these things. - What am I gonna do? - Talk to Jack. What else can you do? - Okay. Hello, is Jack Barkin there, please? - [Woman] Let's go! - Oh, well when will he be back? This is his wife calling. It's important that I speak with my husband. Do you know where he's going? Oh okay. Thank you. Come on. No, you're absolutely right, Kristen. I have to talk to Jack. I have to give him a chance to explain himself. - Good. Look, I'll catch up with you later, all right? - All right. (dramatic music) - Then again, he might have a few other things to explain while he's at it. Nora. Nora, stop. You don't know what that was about back there. - What are you talking about? You saw her! She's all over him! - Come on. We saw two people having lunch. Let's not turn this into some kind of soap opera. - It's all lies, Kristen. First about not having met with Bill and now he's seeing another woman. I mean, all the time he says he's spending at the library doing research on his novel or writing in coffee stops, what, is he spending it with her? - Nora, stop it. What we just saw doesn't prove anything. You gotta find out the truth before you start throwing away your marriage. - Yeah. Yeah well, that is exactly what I'm going to do. (tense music) (Nora sighs) Jack? - [Jack] I'll be out in a sec. - What, are you going out? - Yeah, I'm gonna work at the library. - [Nora] Well, you could work here. - You know what? I gotta do some research. - Jack, I was really hoping that we could talk. - I won't be late. Maybe when I get back. - God, I'm really beginning to hate that novel. - Nora, don't do this. If I don't keep up the momentum now I'm gonna lose it altogether. - I just want us to be together tonight. It is important. - Well, there were plenty of nights when I was sitting at home and you were at drama classes and rehearsals and those were very important too, right? - Jack. Do you still love me? - What is that supposed to mean? - What I said. I need to know if you still love me. - Of course I do. Look, I'll talk to you later. (Nora sighs) - Okay. Jack's file. Jack's file. Open. Violet Requiem, Violet Requiem. Ah-ha. (Nora clears throat) Tony sensed her unease at their current arrangement. An arrangement, not a marriage. - [Jack] That's how he thought of it now. If he thought of it at all. Carrie's unease was okay, though. He had plenty of his own to deal with. Just that morning, she'd come at him again, prattling on about the man who'd disappeared last month. - He told her it was something-- - [Jack And Nora] The police should be handling. - "But they're not handling it," she whined. "And we're all he's got!" Sooner or later she'd find out how Kevin had really disappeared. - [Jack] And that's when Tony would have to take swift and final action. (Nora sighs) - Tony turned the full force of his anger on her. - [Nora And Jack] I'm busting my chops everyday to try to stay ahead of the credit card companies and you're running around aggravating the police department. - She didn't get it. Why was he making such a big deal out of her trying to solve her friend's disappearance? - [Nora And Jack] Worry about us for a change. - Tony said because I think you're-- - [Nora And Jack] Mixing up your priorities big time. (Nora scoffs) - [Nora] He had to smile inwardly at that. - [Jack And Nora] It was just a matter of time until she lost her life as well. - And that's when it would all make sense. He'd have all the money. And he'd have Danielle. - [Jack And Nora] Greed and lust, both fulfilled with just the squeeze of a trigger. - Not that hard. (Nora chuckles) (doorbell buzzes) Oh god. Close, close. All right. (clears throat) Hey Kristen, what is it? - Hey, is Jack here? - [Nora] No, why? - You have to see this. You're not gonna believe it. (tense music) - Sandra Keele got lucky with 13... Wait a minute, isn't that her? Isn't that the woman Jack was with? - Yeah. - Oh my god. Greed and lust, both fulfilled with just a squeeze of a trigger. - Nora, what are you talking about? What is it? - I went into Jack's computer and I read some of his novel. All of this is in it. - What? - The main character kills his wife's friend and then plans to kill his wife. Oh, and Kristen, all the dialogue is from our private conversations. Things that we actually said to one another. - Oh my god. You gotta admit that's pretty twisted. (Nora crying) - You know, we used to say that there was a law against keeping secrets. That whatever we were thinking about we had to share with one another. You know, like hopes, ideas, dreams, whatever. And now it's like Jack is somebody else. The person that I have spent the last five years of my life with doesn't even exist. - Hey. - How did it get like this? - Listen. I don't know what to say to you, but if I could see inside people's heads, maybe my last three relationships might've made more sense. Hey. Want me to throw some cold water on your face? Might make you feel better. Hmm? Come on. (water dripping) No! (dramatic music) - And Jack was just in here. - You better call the super. - Yeah. (Nora scoffs) - That oughta do it. Hell of a freaky break. Who knows what could've gone down if your friend hadn't noticed. - Yeah, I know. Look, how does something like that happen, anyway? - Old pipes. Maybe the joint got brittle and something shifted. - Inside the ceiling? - These old buildings are still settling. Freaky it happening right over the light fixture though. If someone would've been in here when the light was turned on, they would've come out extra crispy. - Would you be able to tell if that pipe had been tampered with? - Lady, I fix plumbing. I'm not a cop. Anyway, why would someone screw around with the plumbing like that? I'm not kidding here. Somebody could've wound up dead. - Thank you. Thanks very much. (Kristen sighs) (sirens wailing) (horns honking) (phones ringing) (police radio chattering) Detective. - Miss Barkin. - Hi. - [Marinello] I didn't expect to see you again. - Look, I've come to ask, no I've come to beg you to please investigate Bill Reagan's murder. - Look, we've already been through this. - Yeah, I know. Look, there's a lady in the paper today, okay? Apparently she won Monday's lottery. - Okay. You came all the way down here to tell me that? - The ticket that she cashed in was Bill's ticket. - Really? Can you at least tell me what connection she had to Mr. Reagan and how she got his ticket? (Nora sighs) (tense music) - Look. All right. I know that this sounds weird, okay, and you think I'm a crazy actress trying to make some big drama out of this whole thing, but... Look, I just need you to investigate this woman, please. - I'll do what I can. (Nora sighs) - Thank you. Okay. - There's one that fell out of the cuckoo's nest right on her head. - Danny, call downtown. See if they finished the autopsy on Bill Reagan. - You're buying her story? - Let's just say I'm shopping. - Okay. All right. - And see what you can turn up on this woman who won the lottery today. Sandra Keele. - All right. Hey Doc Hogan, how are you, good. Listen, any more on the Reagan autopsy? Really? (tense music) All right. Great, thanks. Well, what do you know? The coroner says they don't have a definitive answer on the autopsy but he's found enough to think it's suspicious. He's ordered a full workup. - All right. - Where are you going? - Well, I think we wanna try and guess who saw Bill Reagan last. - Right. - Don't you people ever give up? You raid my club, you don't find nothing. Now you're dragging me down in a bogus homicide wrap? - You know, you're right. A babe in the woods like you. You're like a poster boy for persecution. - Well now you're getting it. See, you should listen to your partner. - He's just getting warmed up. He's got a lot more to say about how Bill Reagan was a regular in your betting parlor. - Social club. I got a lot of regulars. - Yeah, a couple of whom got their knees broken last month 'cause they couldn't cover a bet. - Accidents happen. You can bet on it. - How much did Bill Reagan owe you? - Nothing. I told you, I don't know the guy. - You don't know him? Sure are friendly with a guy you don't know. And then again, maybe not that friendly. - Handy. Nice advice to show us all the evidence we need in one neat little package. - This isn't evidence. This don't prove anything. - Well, it all depends how you present it. This was taken Monday evening and it makes you the last person to see him alive. (dramatic music) If you have anything to say, now might be a good time. - Okay, so I knew the guy. He was a nice old guy. Gabby, but okay. Whistled the same damn tune every time he walked out the door. - So you killed him 'cause you didn't like the tune? - I didn't kill anyone. - How much did he owe you? - The guy was a courier, delivery guy. I don't let a guy like that get too deep into me. - How much? - 200. He goes up and down. He cleans it up, he goes back down again. Hasn't cleaned it up for a while so I was pissed but nobody kills anybody over 200 bucks. - Oh yeah? What is the going rate? - Listen, the guy comes in to lay a few bets. I told him he wasn't gonna play until he paid. - And then he told you about the money? - He said it was his lucky day and he was coming into some cash. He said he would pay me off the next day in full. - And then you got the idea to take him off for his ticket, huh? - His ticket? - Yeah, his ticket! - The lottery ticket, remember? - Well, he didn't say anything about a lottery ticket. He said he was coming into some cash. He left and that was it. (phones ringing) - Can we let this rest now? The guy didn't know anything about the ticket. - Didn't seem to. - Why are you doing this? - Maybe I got into the job because I used to read mysteries as a kid. - Guess what? We got enough real crimes to keep you busy. Think about that. (upbeat jazzy music) - Detective Marinello, midtown south. - The police? - What's your name? - Oh, I'm Penny. What can I do for you? - Well, I'm looking into the death of a courier who made a delivery here a couple of days ago. His name was Bill Reagan. - Oh my god, his death? And that woman was just in here asking about him. - Right. Well, his delivery to this office here was the last of his day. Now, someone in this office might've been the last one to see him alive. Do you remember anything that could help me with my investigation? - All I can tell you is what I told her, that maybe the accountant who was here or maybe Mr. Moore might've seen him. Mr. Moore, could you come to the reception, please? Mr. Moore is our office manager. I hope he'll be able to help you. - Thank you. Oh, Marinello, midtown south. - It's about that courier that woman was asking about. - Bill Reagan. I'm wondering if, you know, you might've seen him. - I don't know what to say to you, detective. All I can tell you is what I told Miss Barkin, that I thought her husband was the only one to talk to him. - Wait a minute. Her husband? - Yeah, Jack Barkin. He's an accountant. He's here doing an audit. I didn't see them together but he went back to where Jack was working. Stayed there quite a while. He seemed pretty excited about something. - Hmm. Thanks Mr. Moore. - Yeah, sure. - Detective, if you're investigating this, does that mean you think he was murdered? - Maybe. - But why would someone murder an old man? - Penny, that's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. (Penny sighs) (phone ringing) (singing in foreign language) - Hey, gorgeous. Today's my lucky day. Every time that feeling came on, something good always happened. We would get a check in the mail or Evelyn would buy a lottery ticket and we'd win a few bucks but there was always something good coming. (knocking on door) - Nora, it's me, Kristen. Come on, I know you're in there. Open the door. Nora, please open the door. Nora, please. Open the door. Hey. What's happening? I've been calling and calling. Why aren't you answering the phone? - I'm sorry, Kristen. I just want some time to think, okay? - Do you mind if we think together? Please? - All right, come on in. You want anything? - No, no thanks. So, what did Jack say when you told him about what we saw? - I didn't ask him. I couldn't do it. - Nora, burying your head in the sand isn't gonna make this all go away. What did you tell the police? - I asked them to investigate Sandra Keele. - What about Jack? You did mention Jack. - I can't implicate my own husband. - Nora, you don't get it. If Jack is involved and you go on withholding information from the police, you become an accessory to murder. - We don't know any of this for sure. I've never asked him face to face. Don't I at least owe him that much? - Well, he lied to you before. What's to stop him from doing it again? - Oh my god, Kristen. What am I gonna do? I still love him. - I know. I know. But if it were me, I'd be telling it to the police first. - I can't do that. Not yet. (tense music) - [Doorman] Good afternoon. - Miss Keele? - Yes. - NYPD. - What's the problem? - Oh, no problem. We'd just like to ask you a few questions. - Actually, I'm kinda busy. - It won't take long. We'll be out of your hair before you know it. - Let's go inside. I can't imagine why my lottery win would be of any interest to you, detective. - Well 13 and a half million dollars always makes for good conversation. - It's funny. I never thought of myself as a particularly lucky person before this. - I guess people's luck can change. - You said you had questions. - A few. Where did you buy that ticket, Miss Keele? - I don't know. I usually buy five or six tickets a week anywhere I happen to be in the city. - Huh. This ticket was purchased Monday morning. Can you tell me where you were on Monday? - Uh, yes. Um, no. I mean, I don't usually keep a log of where I've been. - But surely you'd remember where you bought this ticket. A newspaper stand maybe? A convenience store? - I said I don't remember. I'm sorry. I don't usually expect to be interrogated. - Oh no, this is not an interrogation, Miss Keele. You'll know the difference. (tense music) - I won the lottery. You're acting as if I've committed a crime. - If you have, 13 million dollars would make one hell of a motive, wouldn't it? - A motive? For what? Are you accusing me of something? - Have you ever known a man named Bill Reagan? - No, why? - What about Jack Barkin? - I'm starting to think I should have a lawyer before I say anything else. - Sometimes lawyers stop people from making deals that'll keep them out of prison. Sometimes it's better for people just to get something off their chest. - I'll take my chances with a lawyer. I'm afraid that's all I'm going to say for now. - Think about what I said, Miss Keele. You can reach me at this number. (dramatic music) - It's me. I'll call you if I want to call you. You said this was going to be simple. All I had to do was cash the ticket and there'd be no questions asked. The police, they were just here asking me questions about where and when I bought the ticket. They were not fooling around. No. Well I don't like this. You better do something about it. Okay, well think it out and think it out fast. Okay. Yeah. I love you too. - What do you think? - I don't know what that's woman's got going down but she's the guiltiest lottery winner I've ever seen. - Craziness is contagious, huh? Hey, it's Marinello. What do you have for me? Oh yeah. Oh, thanks. Listen, leave a copy for me on my desk, will you? That was the coroner's office. The final autopsy results are in. Now the original examination didn't show any bruising on the outside of the neck. But when they went in they found the fracture of the Adam's apple and the larynx. - You know, he's right. It ain't over till it's over. - Yeah. More and more the pieces are starting to make sense. Let's play it out, all right. Now, Bill Reagan, he calls Nora and he tells her he's hit the jackpot. - He happens to run into her husband an hour later and tells him the good news too. - An hour after that, someone who knows that Bill is going to Nora's for dinner is waiting for him in the park. That someone kills him and takes the ticket. - The only problem is can we establish a connection between Sandra Keele and Jack Barkin? Maybe bring Barkin in and sweat him. - If I don't miss my guess, he already knows we've been asking questions. He'll be ready for us. - So what? - I think the link between Sandra Keele and Jack Barkin is the ticket. - Yeah but now the ticket's cashed. Dead end. - Not quite. Now we follow the moolah. (tense music) - Nora, what's going on? Are you okay? - You tell me, Jack. Or would that be more prattling on about my dead friend? Would that make you want to satisfy your greed and lust with the squeeze of a trigger? - You went in my computer? - Yeah. It is quite revealing. - Nora, you're starting to worry me. - I'm worrying you? God, that's almost funny. You have used private things that we said to one another. - Nora, I'm a writer. I overhear people in the subway. People tell me things in the office. And I think it's just fair that it ends up in my book. - Oh, and what have people been telling you in the office lately, hmm? How about Bill? Bill tell you anything interesting? - I told you I didn't see Bill for over a month. - Just for once, I would like to hear the truth about you, about Bill, and about this damn lottery ticket. - You're nuts. I have no idea what you're talking about. (Nora laughs) (phone ringing) Hello? Look, this is not a good time right now. Okay, half an hour. All right. I gotta go see a client. (Nora sighs) - [Marinello] Detective Marinello, NYPD. - I'm sorry. This is a really bad time. The bank is closing, I have an appointment. - We won't take up much of your time. Mr.-- - Igus. I'm the branch manager. - Yeah. We're investigating Sandra Keele. You know, the woman that won the pick seven lottery this week. I understand this is where she deposited the winnings. - That much money raised my bank's profile overnight. Too bad it was only for a couple of days. (tense music) - What do you mean? - Miss Keele made a transfer this afternoon, almost the whole balance. - A transfer? To where? - Please, detective. You must understand I'm not allowed to give you that information without a warrant. - Look, Mr-- - Igus. - Yeah, the location of that money may be crucial to the outcome of a homicide investigation. Now if you're worried about the prestige of your bank you're gonna wanna be on record as having cooperated. - It was a numbered account at the bank of the Cayman's. I don't know who it was registered to. It might've been her or her gentleman friend. - Her gentleman friend? Describe him. - [Doorman] Good evening. (tense music) (knocking on door) - Yes? Can I help you? - I'd like to talk to my husband if you don't mind. (dramatic music) - Nora, what are you doing here? - Oh, what's the matter, huh? Supposed to work out differently? Like in your book? - Nora, this isn't what you think it is. - Oh, that's right. You just keep on lying right up to the end. It is so much more consistent. It is so thorough. So you, Jack. - What is she talking about? - Oh, hi. Miss, anyway. Remember me? - [Penny] Yeah. - Yeah I wanna speak to Mr. Moore. - Oh, I'm sorry, you missed him by a half hour. - Where was he going? - He got an emergency call and he left on a business trip. Said he might be gone a few days. (tense music) - Thanks. - [Penny] Is this about the murder? - Hogan, any luck? - Yeah, I tried his place but his wife said he had an emergency business trip. - Yeah, same at his office. - She's not expecting to see him for at least a week. - Listen, if he has his way, that's the last anybody will see him. - Well, I'll call it in. Alert the airports. You wanna take a ride down to JFK and head it up? - No, not yet. Meet me at Sandra Keele's apartment, ASAP. - Right. (siren wailing) - Let me get this straight. You think we're having an affair? - Yeah, you're damn right I do. - Sandra was referred to me. She wanted advice on handling her winnings. - Well who better to handle them? You gave them to her. - I don't know what you're talking about but he's telling you the truth. - Don't even start with me. I just wanted to be sure before I went to the police. - The police? - I know everything, Jack. I know that you saw Bill that day and I know that he told you about the lottery ticket. - Nora, I told you I didn't see him. - I was at the insurance company. There's a record of Bill making a delivery that day. So why didn't you tell me you'd seen him? Huh? - Whoa, hold it. I was out of the office most of that afternoon. - Oh, please. - It's true. I was doing inventory at the collision claim center. You can ask Dexter Moore. He's the one who sent me down there. As a matter of fact, he's the one who referred Sandra to me in the first place. - What? - I didn't know someone had died. I promise you, I had no idea where the ticket came from. He told me he won the lottery. - Who told you? - Dexter. We were gonna run away with the money. He said he couldn't cash it in 'cause he'd have to split it with his wife. We had to make it look like I won it. - Shut up, Sandra. Back up! - Okay, okay, okay. - You should've minded your own damn business. - Hey Dex, you're not gonna get away with this. - Oh yeah. Everything was gonna be perfect. Back up. - All right. - Sandra and Dex off to the Cayman's and then on to South America living happily ever after on 13 million dollars that that simple idiot was just begging me to steal. - So you killed him, huh? - What are you planning to do with us? - The only thing I can do now. - Have you gone crazy? - Maybe I have. But you helped put me here. You know, you are an expensive commodity, Sandra. How else could I afford you? - [Sandra] You can't do this. I won't let you. - You're not gonna have a lot to say about it, you know? - Dex, you don't wanna do this. - Please, baby, baby, please. (gun bangs) (glass shatters) (dramatic music) (Dexter groaning) - [Nora] Come on, come on! Move it! Go! (gun bangs) (gun bangs) (siren wailing) - Hopefully he's here. (Sandra yelps) (gun banging) (Sandra yelps) - Go, go, go. Go, go. Hold it, police! Drop it! (guns banging) - [Marinello] Check him out. - You all right? - Yeah, I think so. - You okay? - Yeah. God, I didn't think you believed me. - Well, I still need you to fill in some of the blanks. - [Nora] Okay. - You're not going anywhere, Miss Keele. And you're gonna do some talking right now. (Sandra sighs) - Bill Reagan told friends that his last day on this earth was going to be his lucky day. But Bill didn't understand his luck wasn't something flighty. It wasn't something that was there one day and not the next. Bill's luck was to have friends. True friends like Nora Barkin and her husband, Jack. And that's a luck that was with him everyday of his life. Nora. (Nora sighs) (somber music) - Well, quite simply, Bill Reagan was one of the nicest people I ever met and I know that we're all gonna miss him and it's hard to come to terms with what happened. But what I'd like to remember is the best of Bill. The little twinkle in his eye. Those tunes he'd always whistle. But most importantly, the incredible openness and affection he had for everyone he met. I am so grateful that I had the pleasure to know him and um, that at least we all get the chance to say goodbye to him properly. Goodbye Bill. Thank you. - Thank you, Nora. And thank you all for coming. That concludes our service. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm gonna miss him though. - I know. Well, for what it's worth, he was very lucky to know you. (Nora chuckles) There's one thing I have to get straight though. Did you really think I killed him? - I don't know what I thought. - How did we ever get to the point where you couldn't just ask me? - Step by step, Jack. I was unhappy with my life. You were angry too. Well, I guess that's where we started anyway. - You think we can change it? I mean, back the way we were? - Yeah. I think we can try. (Nora chuckles) Oh boy. - Let's go. - Mm-hmm. (soft music) Hey, Detective Marinello. What are you doing here? - Well, there are some new developments on the case and after all you've been through and well, all that you've done for the case, I thought it was important that I tell you in person. - Well, is something wrong? - It's about the lottery. - Yeah, we managed to retrieve the money that Moore moved offshore and it's all there. I mean, give or take $100,000. - Well, what's that gotta do with us? - Well, it tuns out that your friend, Bill Reagan, he wrote up a will before he hit the jackpot and, having no family, he listed you two as sole beneficiaries. - Hold it. You're saying that money-- - That 13 million dollars-- - Is ours? - That's what I'm saying. You were very good friends of Bill's. I guess this is his way of telling you what that friendship meant to him. - Oh my god. - That much money? You're kidding right? - The lawyers are on it already. - Well, I don't know what to say. Thank you? - Well, I think you'd better thank your friend Bill. I'm just happy I got to be the one to tell you. Working where I do, I don't get a chance to deliver much good news. - Wow. - And Mrs. Barkin, another thing, I just wanted to say when you were trying to get us to investigate your friend's death, I guess I wasn't a believer. - You weren't alone. - As an older and wiser cop told me one time, you keep an open mind, you have a better chance of solving the crime. - Did he say wiser? I heard him say wiser. - Hey Detective? Thank you. Thanks for believing. (Nora chuckles) - [Jack] Thank you, thank you. - [Marinello] You're welcome. - Oh my god, Jack. That is a lot of money. - I still can't believe it. - Wow. You know, this means I can concentrate on my acting. You don't have to work anymore except on your novel, of course. - Well I think I might have to work on a different ending now. - Hey Bill, I don't know if you can hear me, but thank you. We're gonna be thinking of you and everyday is gonna be our lucky day. (Nora chuckles) (Bill whistling) (upbeat dramatic music)
