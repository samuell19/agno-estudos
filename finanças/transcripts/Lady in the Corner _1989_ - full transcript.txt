Remember the first time I told you about the early bird catching the worm? Morning, Mrs. Guthrie. Morning, Joseph. Bye, aunt grace. I love you. I love you, too. Come back soon. I will. I promise. Goodbye, sue-sue. Thank you, Joseph. You're welcome. Mrs. Guthrie. [Music plays] Good morning. I didn't think anybody would be in... Well, I didn't think anybody would be here in the building. Well, Mrs. Guthrie--aah! Oh, damn! I'm sorry. I--i, uh... If I ever get unpacked, it'll be a miracle. I don't have a secretary yet, so I... Well, why don't I turn this off? There. Good. Well, I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I'm sorry. I--i didn't... Well, I will not say I'm sorry again. Sorry. Well, you surprised me, Mrs. Guthrie. Well, I'm Susan Dawson. Oh, I've heard of you. Well, I work here now. Do you? Yes. I see. Uh, hi. Uh, excuse me. [Telephone rings] [Knock on door] Good morning. What's the big idea? Uh... Oh. She was available, so I hired her. No sense letting her go to vogueor glamour. Or maybe over to the Russians. Well, you were on vacation. She's a very talented girl. At putting lipstick on little girls. We need a new contributing editor. That's what made her reputation at that rag she worked for. Kiddie models. That was there. She's here now. Is she? I know the rules. You don't want her, get rid of her. Listen, she'll have another job in 30 seconds. I've a mind to do that. O.k. She's aware it takes two of US to hire an editor. Fine. She came on that basis. 8 and 9-year-old kids smeared with make-up. Not too many clothes on. Is that what she expects to do here? No. She knows who sets policy here. David, what are you up to? Come on. You're giving me credit for being a lot more devious than I am. I wouldn't exactly call it credit. Grace, we need a shot of energy here. Dont we? Take her, mold her, make her over. You know that. Are you having an affair with her? Oh, don't be ridiculous. It's not so ridiculous. A shot of energy-- she's not even 30 years old. And you are a merry widower. Please. I don't need an ulterior motive to hire an editor. Tell me, how did you get her away from foxy girl? I didn't have to. She left. Susan Dawson is one of the hottest young editors in the business. She's had a meteoric rise. That's right. And she was looking to make a change. From fashion editor at foxy girl, which is one step from the top of the top-selling magazine, in the business to grace magazine, with a nice, quiet contributing editor's office where half her things don't fit? It doesn't make sense. I think it's because she admires you so much. Oh, David. You and I have been together far too long for me not to know when you're hiding something. Well, I intend to find out what. This would be for the working woman that would make for a coordinated wardrobe. But everything's interchangeable. Skirts, tops, dresses, accessories-- all kinds of combinations. Ensembles a woman can put on in the morning, stay in through the workday, and go out at night and still dressed in high style. Like men can with dark suits and tie changes. But no suits and ties, nothing mannish. I think I've got a title for you. "From morn till midnight." You mean you like it. Yes, I like it. Who wants it? Theo? I'd love to have it, but it feels more like Mary. Ok. Mary, what about it? Uh, tell US more. Well, I'd like to-- I'd want to use four models and follow them through a day as if they were working women. Well, why models, Lilly? Why fake it? Why not real people? Models aren't people? Well, yeah, but I mean real recognizable, maybe even famous people. We could commission four designers and have them each do one. Originals? Yeah, originals. Why not? Be terrific, but-- miss Dawson, let's let Lily and miss Smith work out the story, shall we? Yeah, of course. I thought it was such a dynamite idea-- your enthusiasm has been duly noted. You are a veritable shot of energy. And this your first editorial meeting. This is hardly my first. I've been to hundreds. This is my first meeting at grace. How do we compare? There is no comparison. This is the finest fashion magazine ever. And you have no suggestions as to how we could improve? Well, I would like to see a second soup in the machine. Good idea. Now, uh, what about something for the fall issue? An idea of your own. An assignment? I'm ready for anything. I think you're holding out on US. You know, when I came in this morning, this young lady was already at her computer. In what I would daresay was a creative trance. Yeah. That. Would you like to share it with US? No, that piece isn't nearly ready for a crowd yet. This crowd might be of some help. What's the subject? It's too young to tell. I'd like to get it focused first. You think perhaps it's a little too spicy for US? Right. I'll go get it. No, never mind. Not now, it's too near lunch. Sorry I brought it up. Mary, are those hepburn prints ready? Mm-hmm. Thanks very much, everybody. It's going to be marvelous. Mrs. Guthrie. Way to go, Lily. Mrs. Guthrie. Mrs. Guthrie, this is not good. Mrs. Guthrie, what was that all about? Not now, I have a lunch date. Please, Mrs. Guthrie. Are we off on the wrong foot? Did I wear the wrong thing? You don't like me? You dont even know me you want to dislike me, fine but get to know me and the dislike me. Believe me, I will get to know you, Ms. Dawson. But right now, you'll have to excuse me. Well, I think you're high-handed and maternalistic. Come in. Did you call each other names in the halls of that other magazine you worked for? When appropriate. It is never appropriate at this magazine. Ever. Nor do we circumvent the order of editorial relationships. You make it sound like physics. Mary Smith is senior fashion editor. And she has more taste in her slightest whim than you have in your deepest thought. I came here to grace precisely-- you came here for reasons I haven't yet discovered. But when I do, I'll decide what to do with you. Well, do I get an assignment? When we think of one for you. Have a dynamite day. What did you expect? Tears? [Intercom buzzes] Miriam, get me Mr. Henderson, will you? He's gone to London? All right. Thanks. Dismiss her. Not so fast. Thank you. One thing David did say that made sense-- she's talented. I've seen her work. You couldn't miss it these last few years. I know. It's offensive... But it's well done. Now if she just had some taste to go along with that talent... There you are again, single-handedly converting philistines. Not so single-handedly. Thank you. Aren't you tired of it? No. No, I'm not. What is it with some of these young people today? They have great energy, marvelous ability, and not the slightest idea what to do with it. Anything goes, so everything goes. Yeah. It's Albert Einstein's fault. Einstein? It's all relative. There is no good or evil, no right or wrong. It's all relative. I don't think that's what he had in mind. They do. Hmm. Maybe. Tell me something. Do you think it's possible to take someone from a rag like foxy girl which borders on pornography-- oh, I think it's already crossed the border. Who owns foxy girl? That vile man in London. Charles Patrick bought it. He's buying everything. He tried to buy US last year. David went to London. Not David. He has too much class. Well, he'd better have... Or I'll kill him. The chartreuse in suede group. Oversized shawl for dramatic embellishment. Che Bella. It's charming. Could you drop the shawl, please? Exquisite line. Hmm. I think that's very good-looking. So a-hunting we will go. C'est tres chic. Tu trouves? Gray flannel. Flare jacket. May I? Quite fine. Mm-hmm. These shorts are really nifty. I think we could do a whole page on this outfit. You're the boss. Understated. Navy boucle. Classic. I love the proportions, and these shoulders are splendid. Thank you, Dana. Toned down gold lame. Cinched trousers. Simple and daring. As they say in China-- ooh, la la. [Telephone rings] Yes. What can I say? Stunning. Oh, it is that, and you cut like an angel. Bravo. [Applause] Yes. I'll tell her. Grace. Yes? David's back. Thank you. Excuse me. May I? Well. How was London? Well, changing. Whole world is changing as we go slipping into history. Speak for yourself. Didn't rain anyway, and I'm getting to where I feel the weather. I'm planning to spent a lot more time in lenox. Uh, gardening, huh? Reading, writing. Some gardening, yeah. You never have seen it. You've never invited me. Well, I never could. Want to come tomorrow? Tomorrow? For the weekend. No. Come on. David. Why not? Just relax, enjoy yourself. No. I would not enjoy watching you slip into history. Are you going to tell me or make me ask? You're selling it, aren't you? We close this afternoon. Thisafternoon? Hold onto your temper. Why didn't you tell me? You'd try to stop me. You think I won't try now? Well, you can't. Oh, d-- what a rotten thing to do. You let me go on vacation, then you-- oh, it started long before that. It did? Let's get out of this every-day-another-crisis business. Slow down. Let them put out the 500 glossy pages every month. Of course! What an idiot I am. All the signs were there. For months now-- lenox, gardening, relaxing. I missed every signal. That's just my point. We're too busy to look around. We don't need this magazine. You and I can be creative in a whole new way. I don't want a whole new way. I want this way. This magazine is my creation. I like it. Who are you selling it to, or do I have to tell you that, too? Wait. He gave me his word. He'll guarantee-- his word? For heaven's sake, the man is a pornographer. Now, you're using the term very loosely. What, pornography? Yes. By legal definition, Patrick's never published pornography. Come off it. You know what I'm talking. Will you listen? No, I won't listen. The courts may not define pornography, but anybody over 4 knows it when he sees it. Are you going to listen to what I have to say or not? Not if you've turned into one of them. Hiding behind a legal definition to make a couple extra bucks. Charles Patrick is the only publisher who can give this magazine a chance for survival. He has other publications that can make up for smaller profits here. And he wants the prestige. Oh, great. Support something beautiful with sewage. I went behind your back for a very good reason. Yeah. Money... Or cowardice. Or both. Or have you turned into a dirty old man? Stop that! I've saved you months of frustration. And embaracemnt. You'd have fought and lost. Not necessarily. Well, I am finished here. I've done it because I've got more important things to do. Now will you listen? I want to take you with me. Did you honestly believe this would bring US together? I hoped it would. Oh, David. It's better than months of wrangling. Well... I am gonna give you a chance to watch me try? You may have more important things to do, but I have a magazine to get out. Miss Dawson, come with me, please. I peeked in on the showing in the fashion room. I hear your former employer is visiting US this afternoon. You mean Charles Patrick? He was your boss at foxy girl,right? He didn't take a personal role in day-to-day operations. But you do know him, don't you--personally? Yes. I'll bet you think you do. Is this going to be another scolding? Don't worry. We stopped using thumbscrews years ago. Come in. And close the door behind you. Well, if you know about Charles Patrick, you know this magazine is all but sold. All but. And you might as wel know Mr. Patrick intends to make some changes. Yeah. Would one of those changes be you replacing me as editor in chief? The magazine should have continuity. I've already told Mr. Patrick that you should be made editor emeritus. Well, how thoughtful... And how reassuring for the advertisers. Well, you could stay here in this office. While you and Patrick vandalize my magazine, right? That is not why he is buying it. We'll keep the old readership and reach out to a whole new one. Of course. I think you should stay. And work for you two? Work with me. I'm sorry. I choose my colleagues much more carefully than that. I believe we could work very well together. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. There will be changes, but gracehas made changes over the years. Becasue I chose to make them and never at the cost of decency. There's nothing indecent about anything I do. You know, there's an enormous difference between fashion and cheap sex. Well, why not simply sex? After all, sex isn't by definition cheap. Sex is life, and I think you'll find that grace'sreaders find sex to be a healthy, lovely part of life. They have fewer inhibitions than before. We did everything you do. We do everything you do. We just don't do it for a camera. Oh, look at your daily newspapers. Look at your own magazine. You've got ads for swimsuits and underwear and health clubs that would have been unthinkable before. Now, does that make them indecent? In the hands of responsible people, no. But in the hands of someone like Charles Patrick, anything and everything will be degraded. So you're the sole defender of public morality? On this magazine, absolutely. Now, part of my job is to make moral judgments. I know that's not a very fashionable thing to say-- moral judgments-- but I'm an editor. Excuse me. And if a writer came to me with this, your latest issue of foxy girl, your cover story-- "what to wear before going to bed-- kinky styles in heavy metal"-- I'd judge that to be immoral. I wouldn't print it. Well, I evaluate my readership. And give them what they want? Of course. We all do that. I set standards for my readers. I strive to sensitize them. Charles Patrick brutalizes them. If my readership decides to reject my standards, that's when I'll go, not before. The last time I looked, I was doing fine. Well, good, great. So keep doing it with me. What difference does it make who owns the magazine? Forgive the platitude, if you lie with dogs, you get up with fleas. The truth is you don't like Charles Patrick. I don't trust him. If you do, you're in for a terrible awakening. I'm afraid there's nothing you can do. Grace magazine belongs to him. You said once you wanted me to get to know you. I think I've made a start. I see that you're smart enough to know that you need me around for a while. And it's been suggested that I make you over. Perhaps I will. Then you will leave here-- me? With more humility and respect for those with more experience and taste than you. Uh, you may go now. You are unbelievable. I came in trying to be generous with you. You wanted to know if I would front for you and Patrick. It was my idea. I'm sure he made you think it was. Well, now you have your answer. I won't. So you'd rather lose your magazine completely? I don't intend to lose my magazine. It's sold. It's all over. Like the man said, the game's not over until it's over. I've just found out who the players are. The game is just beginning. [Intercom beeps] Miriam? Yes, Mrs. Guthrie? When you got a moment, come in, please. Of course. Thank you. Oh, Mrs. Guthrie, Mr. Anderson has someone with him. Yes, I was hoping so. Thanks so much, Louise. Oh, hello, David. I'm sorry to be late. Mr. Patrick? Good afternoon. I'm grace Guthrie, editor in chief here. And you, sir? Robert Johnson. I'm Mr. Patrick's attorney. How do you do? Pleased to meet you. So you want to buy the magazine for your collection? Yes. I see the cat's out of the bag now. Out and hissing. I suppose you know about the agreement I have with this company? What agreement is that? Well, I have an option to buy the magazine myself. Grace magazine cannot be sold unless I am allowed to match any offer made for its purchase. Once a bid is made, that bid freezes and cannot be increased. I have 90 days in which to match it. What's your final offer? There's no such agreement. Henderson, is this in writing? Uh... Yes it is, in fact. Somewhere. David, it was drawn up when we were in those five little rooms on 62nd street. Remember? Now surely you haven't forgotten 35 years ago, have you? It was long ago. It was just after you named the magazine without consulting me. We even had a drink of champagne on it, remember? What could be more binding than that? Yes, of course I recall giving her the option. Strange you never mentioned this before. Well, so many years. I never thought she'd be interested. I have no intention of freezing my offer for 3 months it's more like 30 days. I recall 90. 60? They're making this up. There's no option. What difference does it make? Let him do it if he wants to. Go ahead. Sell it to her for a dollar. I don't need your fancy rag. Do you really intend to honor this fictitious option? I remember very clearly now, yes. It was 30 days. Mrs. Guthrie, I have an offer to put to you editor emeritus? I've already turned that down. This is a hell of a way to do business, dragging me up here pulling a last minute stunt like this. Well, it is a situation I have to honor my commitment to Mrs. Guthrie. Charlie, take it or leave it. I walk out of here, and you're stuck. And you lose the chance of owning the most prestigious magazine in the world. And acquiring the respectability you've always wanted and never had. And don't deserve. I heard that. I hope you did. You're cutting your own throats. You dont have a buyer. Looks like I have or I may have in 30 days. Can you wait 30 days to be respectable? All right, 30 days from today. Thank you. Bright and early. Gentlemen... Till then. 21 million. We can do it. I know we can. If enough people know about this... You know, half the people in this town, in fact, half the people in this country, would like to run Patrick out on a rail and run him out. Yes, but the other half believe in his constitutionally protected right to print whatever he wants. How I'd like to give the founding fathers a look at what he prints. My profligate father, as is well known, squandered the family fortune before I was 11, but he did leave me the renoir. No, no Omar. We are not going to sacrifice that renoir. Collateral. We need investors, backers, madmen. We need someone with a head for business. It's going to be a problem, grace. Why? You raise capital for people starting businesses all the time. It's not as if you were a youngster. My age? What's that got to do with it? It's difficult to get credit. You're kidding. You mean, if I were some young kid with no reputation, no experience, I could raise the money? Probably. Oh, that's ridiculous. I mean, I'm going strong. I'm the best. I'm at the top. Financial institutions don't make big investments in people over 60 unless they have great wealth. Who needs money if you got great wealth? Huh? Now you have no equity in the magazine at all? No. Not very nice of him. He offered more than once, but I, uh... I wanted my independence. Mm-hmm. That was stupid of me, huh? That's what you get for working on a salary all your life. Bill... Help me. Please. Charles Patrick is a very skillful, very nasty fighter. I'm sure he is, but I've got you. Haven't I? Well... I must congratulate you on freezing his last offer. That was a clever little stroke of finance. That runs in the family, you know. Let's see if we can get you a little working capital. You need money to make money. What time is it in Zurich? Hi, aunt grace. Hi, honey. Aunt grace, I want to show you my sketches. Well... You are staying for dinner, aren't you, grace? Well, since this is business.... Yes, I'd be delighted to. Now, what have we here? Grace, Patrick's last offer was 21 million? That's right. I have a feeling it was less before I entered the room. Heinz gottfried, please. Bill Guthrie from New York. Well, there's nothing we can do now. If all else fails, at least you got David a few more million. He should share that with you. He mentioned that. You, of course, said no. I want grace magazine. Aunt grace, look. Yeah. Well, you did these? Yes, be honest. I'm always honest. Don't be nice 'cause I'm only 13. I wouldn't. Cause I'll know if you're not being honest. Honey, the first thing you have to know-- let your work speak for itself, ok? Ok. I'll leave you two pros to it. Thanks, darling. Heinz, did I wake you? I didn't think so. Listen, I have a little business investment for you. Yes, I think there's a good chance you could lose it all. It's someone I know very well. It's my aunt, grace Guthrie. I think he's about to propose marriage. She wants to buy the magazine. No, not from Patrick. She's bidding against him. About half a million to work with. You could do it as a limited partnership, or you just want to make it a loan? Fine. You leave it where it is. Heinz, danke schoen. Bye-bye. Well...done. Just like that? Yeah. Half a million dollars? Well, it's not the first half that's hard to get, it's the last. Heinz gottfried had a few choice words about Charles Patrick. He did? What did he say? Mostly German. Will you look at me? I'm shaking. I don't know how you do this every day, I couldn't. Well, if you were to ask me to close my eyes and decide whether spring should be yellow or green or purple, and that on my choice, thousands would spring into action and lives would be affected, my brain would freeze. When it comes to money, this is what I do. And you do it well. But it's a little scary for me. If dad were alive, you'd be in this together. Yeah. I know we would. We are. Ok? Good evening. Thank you. Good night, Joseph. Good night. He said you were expecting him. Oh. It's all right, Julia. I told him I didn't know anything about it. But he said you'd be angry if I didn't let him in. It's all right. Really. I didn't give him that drink. He took it. I understand. Ok? She hasn't changed. No. She has her orders, you know. What? 35-year-old orders? Afraid so. I tried to explain. I'm single now, you know. My wife died. I'm not a married man anymore. And? And she almost broke my foot off in the door. Sorry. I hope she didn't hurt it. Did she? Good. You were terrific this afternoon. Of course I was. I don't want to talk about that. Not that it makes up for anything else. I said I don't want to talk about that, ok? I dont wanna talk about Patrick, the magazine, or pornography or none of it. Ok. Because there's something else. Listen.... I'm going to become director of the bendheim museum in lenox. So-- and i-- it's not just gardening. No, I was trying to tell you that this morning but it's little hard to get a word in because you never let me finish. I know. It's a terrible habit. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I've got a job for you as well because I'm going to put in a collection of historical costumes, the best in the world. And I want you to head it. Oh, David. If it were anyone other than... Charles Patrick. Will you forget about him? Think about yourself. You can build something beautiful, permanent. The Patricks won't be able to touch it. I can't say it's not tempting, but... There is a war on. Stop fighting it. Don't break your heart. I won't because I'll win it. That man is not gobbling up our magazine. I want to tell you something. There are going to be checks coming in from all over the world. Just tonight, with one little phone call, one half a million dollars. What do you think of that? I think you're the most vital and tenacious woman in the world. Where your knowledge is concerned, you're a national treasure. Ooh. This collection will be the finest ever. Can you tell me a better combination? No, you're not getting me to give up. You think I'll build a whole building wing to keep you off the street. Well... Maybe later. After you lose. No. No. Not even later. I can't even think it's there to fall back on. I can't. Mull it over. I don't want to mull it over. I can't just quietly walk away and watch something splendid that I have poured half of my life into become a trophy on that man's wall I can't do that. I'll keep the job open for a month. Please don't. I need every ounce of resolve. And if I know there's something there to fall back on, I might not have it. Ok. Ok. I got another deal for you. What? Well... At least I know you're not having an affair with Susan Dawson. Shut up. Marry me? Look at this. I'll call you right back. She can't be more than 10. I got them about an hour ago, courtesy of... You know who. Well? What do I do with them? First get an ax. Then take these and miss Dawson and toss them in the circular file. Uh, no, no. No, not her, not yet. Uh, we'll keep her around for a while. There has got to be something feminine under all that feminism. I'm sorry. I hope you got insurance. Not enough. This is good. It's provocative and bold. And it sells magazines, but it's also good. Artistically good. Well, Mrs. Guthrie-- is stuck somewhere in 1950, 1940, god knows where. It's Mrs. Guthrie's province. She approved the piece on children's fashion. Obviously, she didn't like the way it turned out. Neither do I. She sets me up to knock me down. It's her game. Oh, Susan, slow down. I didn't get where I am by going slowly. Yes, but you're here now. You're going to take it over soon. So if you stand still and shut up. You might learn somethings. I didn't expect to be sitting around in my offcie for an entire month twitilling my thumbs I want to work. I want to work with her. Work with her. Take criticism when it comes. I'd welcome it. She's shutting me out. Grace Guthrie's a great editor because she's fair. Almost to a fault. Personal feelings never get in the way of her judgment. Well, they are this time. Then it's the first time in 40 years. It's still there between you two, isn't it? Better I should ask than hear it elsewhere. Better you mind your own business. See? That's the difference. You're so uptight about those things. So you were lovers. So what? So you two were a famous secret liaison. Everybody talks about it but the two of you. So why don't you talk about it? Clear the air. We could even do a spread about it. You're a very talented young lady. The fastest and brightest animal on earth, the American girl. I just wonder if you're so busy going places, you don't have time to become someone. You could turn those perceptive powers on yourself. You might find some rough spots. Ok, I shot my mouth off. I was out of line. I'm sorry. There. There's one thing I'm right about. She's not giving me a fair shot. Tell her. Well, you give me something I can put in the fall issue, and I'll put it in. You mean something straight, something you would do. I do not. I mean something that demonstrates restraint in keeping with this publication. We don't shock to get attention here. We don't have to. Can I set up a shooting session? Yes, within reason. A photographer? Anyone on staff. And you'll judge it fairly? No prejudice? Oh, miss Dawson. I have not been prejudging you. Right. All right. I want to do a piece on guerrilla fashion. As in ape? As in military. All right. Uh, miss Dawson. I assume these guerrillas will be adults? Yes. Mrs. Guthrie. Lovely. I'll look forward to seeing it. Beautiful. Chin down. That's it. Lean just a bit more. That's it. Beautiful. I want to get that chin up. Want some sexy looks in there. Beautiful, good. Good, great, great. Nice. Wade, stop. Hold it a second. I don't like this. This is really boring. Can you get down there for a second? O.K? Just jump down. We need some energy here. Let's try something. Uh, shelley, just grab her. Grab her. Now grab her back. That's the idea. Now, Tracy, knock her hat off. That's good. Shelley, knock her hat off. All right! Get into it more. Come on, be tough. Ok, now we're cooking. Keep going. Get a little tougher, a little meaner. Don't smile. Get the camera off that and follow them around. It's hot. Yeah, rip the shirt off. That's really good. Back to your battle stations right now. Get tougher. Get mean. That's good. Get down. Get her down. That's it. I like that. All right. No, don't smile. This is war. You're mad. You're fighting for your lives. Don't let her roll you over, Tracy. That's terrific. Fight back. I like this! Ok, up, up. Let's get up. I like that. That's good. Ok. Now you're happy. You're satisfied. You just had the best sex. Allright, now we can get to work. All right, girls. Let's take it from the top. Right there. Beautiful. Good. Good. Great. Great. Riveting, aren't they? Very. We could print them. The girl's good. She's a menace, but she's good. Buried somewhere in the middle pages, we could. Couldn't we? Let's sleep on it. I've been striking out all day. Don't feel bad. So have I. That's comforting. And it's my profession. You know, by now they all know why I'm calling. "Just lock up your money. Here comes grace Guthrie." Well... Here they are. Oh. Look who came in right behind them. I wonder if she knew i'd be here and is deliberately parading in here with that man. Who is that with her? William Guthrie. I don't know who the other two are. Her son? No, she has no children. Her husband was brought back from world war ii in a box. This fellow's her nephew. More like a surrogate son. Investment banker, money manager, access to millions. A comfort to a childless lady in her golden years. You don't think she could pull this off, do you? I never prophesy. What's the whole story with her and David Henderson? It's all in the computer. We've put the facts together several times, once for private life magazine and another for the gossip, but we never ran it. Still, if you think it's... Heating up again. Oh, I don't know. I was just curious. She and Henderson were lovers for a time. After the war? Yes. There's no dirt there. Henderson's wife was one of those plain, quiet women, afraid of her own shadow. She couldn't or wouldn't keep up with his success in life. Some say she wasn't very bright. Spent time in and out of institutions. Breakdowns. Couldn't take the pressure. Perhaps that's why I hold a soft spot in my heart for the poor fellow. Do you? Well, why do you think I... Suggested this 30-day charade? Mother bludgeon over there had him backed into a corner, wielding her battle-ax. I saved the man's... Dignity. Am I in your computer? Indeed you are. If you like, after dinner, why don't we pop up to my office, and I'll show it to you. Your electronic keyhole. Yes, I like that. Electronic keyhole. There's a whole new magazine for US to do together. So, what do you say, after dinner, shall we compute? You make it sound so romantic. You're beyond that, aren't you? You're the new woman. Romance is for those unliberated ladies who are so devoted to grace magazine. Is that what you think of them? They have their place. And we liberated women, do we have our place? That sounds like a trick question. I get the feeling you don't like women much. And yet you're buying grace. I don't hunt, but I own the hunter's journal. You hunt. This is such a treat. With all good intentions in the world. We don't get out as often as we'd like the children, the house, the what not. Before you know it, life has passed you by. No, I doubt that. What you're living is life. This? Well... Just a restaurant. Now, we've been wining you and dining you for a reason. We'd like to sell you something. I'll make it easy on you. The answer's yes. That was easy. We've made lots of money together. Grace magazine is a natural diversification for meridan. Let me tell you why. Apart from its being the most beautiful magazine in the world. Thank you. Meridan acquires companies in many fields. And every corporation is independent and autonomous. However, they're all part of the same family-- the meridan family. This coincidence of your calling me is remarkable. Because we are--and this is, please, very inside for another week-- although you might buy a little stock if I were you-- we are acquiring laguna lady. The big fashion house. Uh, yes, I know. Uh... Precisely what kind of a relationship would you expect grace magazine to have with laguna lady? Well, they'll pay for all of their advertising and plenty of it. And if you could give US an editorial boost from time to time, uh, maybe a feature or two once or twice a year, well, that would be good for everybody, wouldn't it? When Mrs. Henderson discovered the affair, she threatened suicide and almost made it. It was in all the columns for weeks. Rumor has it that grace broke it up. She was also quoted as saying, "we can't build our happiness on other people's unhappiness." Anyway, she left him cold but kept the job. So David and the wife stuck it out for 35 long years? Right. Until she died six months ago. Makes one feel somewhat sorry for grace Guthrie. Why? Because she wouldn't wreck a wretched marriage? She probably felt a sense of sisterhood for the little wifey. I really think you are a misogynist. Now, now. Language. She and David worked together every day afterward and never got involved again? She consoled herself with escorts. But everything came second to the magazine. Now that's about to go, and Mrs. Henderson's with the angels. She could do worse than cuddling with David Henderson again. I wonder what she will do. Thank you. They didn't buy laguna lady. I don't know why? I love their clothes. It would be a blatant conflict of interest. I had no idea. I know, I know. That laguna lady? It sounds like a race horse. It's one of the biggest knock-off houses in the business. I'm sorry. And there those two sit, sharpening their knives. Well, shall we? Let's. Perhaps she'll reconsider your offer and stay on for the transition. Hi. Good evening. Did you look at the proofs of the guerrilla shoot? Yes. And? Well, I suppose I'm just a hopelessly old-fashioned pacifist. No. Good night. Charlie. I want her out. That magazine is mine. I've been manipulated and ridiculed and kicked around from the minute she saw me. I want her office empty. I want her on that elevator, and I'm going to count the numbers going down. I finished the copy with a great title-- "stand out in camouflage." Oh. Uh, I'm sorry, Lily, I forgot to tell you. It's, uh...It's dead. She blew it out of the water. But she hasn't even read it. She saw the pictures. I am sorry. I should have told you this morning. Did she say why? She doesnt have to say why. It's my piece. So it's dead. We should have put your name on it, it would have gotten into the issue she's never been like that. No, she's never been fighting for her life before. Well, read it anyway. Hey, listen. It's not wasted. I promise you. Come the revolution, we'll print it. I can't believe this is a personal thing against you. I don't know if it's because she's got me mixed up with Patrick or if I come on strong or...i don't know. Of course, I did pick a stupid time to ask her about it. We were at the same restaurant for dinner last night, and Patrick was right there. It wasn't my most tactful moment. Sometimes my mouth has a mind of its own. [Telephone rings] Hang on a second. Hello? Yeah. Tell me what you think about it. I have to go before the babysitter charges golden time. What? So mother bludgeon bites the dust? Yeah. So I guess that's it, then. Ok. Bye. That was Patrick. A big money man just turned her down. Looks like she's lost her magazine. Look, Lily, I did everything that I could for her. Really. I--i even offered... Wait a minute. I want to show you something. Don't go, yet. Your babysitter can wait another second. Here. Look. This is my grace Guthrie box. Yeah. Every cover, every article, every editorial she wrote... By grace Guthrie, about grace Guthrie. I was a grace Guthrie freak. I'd make twice as much at other magazines. But I chose to come here. Because I grew up with this box, and more like it. And she has treated me like germs. So, i-I'll keep the box... But she can go. Good night. Good night, Lily. Thanks. No, no. Go home to your family. I know that. Well, don't let it. We're doing whatever we can. Yeah, and give the kids an extra special hug for me, will you? Yeah. All right. Bye, dear. [Knock on door] Shall I stay, or is that all? No, Miriam. That's all. Thank you. If you sign those letters, I'll drop them on my way. Tomorrow will do. Well, i--i will be here tomorrow, so don't go into mourning yet. I know. I didn't mean... I know. It'll be all right. It will. I'm just so unhappy about all that. Well, I've got a whole week yet and commitments for lots of money. But how could they? You are grace magazine. Go home, dear. Go on. [Knock on door] You have been avoiding me? Yes. Rumor has it you raised 8 million bucks. Rumor's not quite up to date. We've raised 9. Only 12 more to go. Good luck. Thanks. Are we celebrating something special? Not that I'm pressing for an answer. Not much, you aren't. You know... I've been thinking a lot, and I see that... This is what you had to do. Margaret died and-- this is a turning point for you, but not me. No. If this was 35 years ago, and Margaret was suddenly gone-- if this were 35 years ago, I would be madly in love with you. But it isn't. And I'm not. Oh, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I... Well... It's ok. I just wasn't ready to hear it put so clearly. I thought it best just to say it right out. Because I've been thinking about it for months now, ever since she died. And... Well, I kind of turned myself inside out searching for that... Magic that we had. Maybe that was asking too much. I don't know, but... I couldn't find it. Now, I feel now just exactly as I did then. Your eyes haven't changed in the slightest. Oh, Davey... I'm really sorry. You know, they have these marriages where nobody loves anybody. With US, at least we'd know one of US is in love. No. A bird can't fly on one wing. No chance at all? Of course. As my dearest and most cherished friend always. You know that. Don't you? Ok. What are you going to do then? If I lose, you mean? Quit kidding around. Now come on. You've got a week to go. You'll never raise $12 million in that time. I might. You got more bad news tonight. How do you know that? The whole office knows. They're following it like it was the Superbowl. They're taking bets down in the mail room now. You could make a grand exit. The museum? Yup. Well, I love museums, but I wouldn't want to live in one. We'll make a big announcement. There's going to be a grace Guthrie party with world press, huh? And then a triumphant, graceful exit. No, no, no. You want to stay here and get kicked in the pants? You didn't really think I wouldn't do this, did you? Oh, I suppose I knew you would. You know... This magazine is the best gift anybody ever gave me... And I can't just hand it over. I just can't. [Computer keyboard clicks] Clicking, clicking, clicking. Hmm? Acoustics. The acoustics in these offices are maddening. What are you talking about? Wondergirl and her computer. I don't hear anything. There must be a duct or something between here and there. Well, she works hard. Mmm. Like a beaver. Chewing on all the wrong logs. I told you, the world's changing. Shh! She stopped. Changing? Yes, I know. Fast. Too fast. Oh, how I'd love to slow it down a little. Well, my darling, I'm rooting for you. Yeah, sure. I am. If you win, at least I'll always know where I can find you. Oh, hell. David. You know, uh... Davey-- hi. Having a farewell drink? Yes, as a matter of fact, we are. Would you care to join US? Not me. I'm just leaving. Oh. Yeah, all right. Good night. Good night. I didn't think you would admit defeat this soon. A farewell drink only means that in one week, one of US will be gone. It doesn't specify which one. Would you like vodka, champagne, or milk and cookies? No hemlock? Not today. Whatever's open. Fine. In point of fact, I have been remiss. Usually I invite new editors in for a drink on arrival. But you... You came in the side way. You know, when you do go, we're going to throw a major dinner for you. Speeches, gold watches, gala testimonials, the works! It might even make a color spread. That is the second party I have been offered tonight. Will yours have naked little nymphs popping out of cakes to please Mr. Patrick? I'm not his errand girl. No? I think the other stuff he publishes is just as sickening as you do. Then you're keeping pretty sickening company. Only temporarily. In a week, he'll be far away from here. And I'll have total editorial autonomy. Until he fires you. Just because he publishes some risque magazine-- he publishes pornography. Soft-core, hard-core. Well, that does not mean he'll do it to this magazine. He may not turn this magazine into filth, but have you any idea what he can do to you? I'll be the editor in chief. And he'll be no further away than that telephone. Oh. I see the strategy. You've lost. Winston aldridge turned you down, huh? That's it. All the marbles. You're desperate. So you invite me in here to drive a wedge between me and Patrick. You think that would keep him from buying this magazine, do you? Aw. You're just a cog in his machine. Fit in, or he'll toss you right out. It is funny you should put it that way. You're the one who's trying to get me to fit in. Yes, I have. I don't fit, do I? And I haven't tossed you out, have I? No. You've used every chance to make me look bad. I've been giving you the chance to demonstrate taste and a little self-control. Dismissing my work arbitrarily because it deals with subjects you don't like? Don't you think I know what other people do with rock and pop and punk? Well, that's what theydo. I want to take that same material and raise it into art. But you won't even try to take the time to understand that. Well... There isa dream in you. [Telephone rings] [Ring] Want me to get that? No. No. I'll get it. Yes? Locust valley? Oh, bill! I-I'm on my way downstairs right now. Uh, don't let me rush you. Finish your drink. Once upon a time, I was e.B. Bennett, a successful man with a happy retail company that branched out here and there. Now i'm Bennett intertech... With oil Wells and hotels... Skyscrapers in eight cities. They put my name on movies my great-grandchildren shouldn't go to see. Ha ha. And they roll me out and show me to the stockholders. How did this happen? I never took the time to find a human being I wanted to take over when I was ready to give up. So who took over? A company took over. A conglomerate. I'm a big tycoon... But I'd rather have the store. And all because I didn't take the time to find a personal successor. Can you see how this applies to you? Uh... You want me to designate my successor? That would make me happy. Could you explain, how would that work in the purchase of the magazine, Mr. Bennett? I give you a signed letter of commitment for all the capital you need to buy the magazine. In the letter is a blank that you fill in with the name of who should be the editor in chief just in case Mrs. Guthrie... Is out of town. Our problem, Mr. Bennett, is that... Mrs. Guthrie has six days left on her option. Finding a potential editor in chief in so short a time would be difficult. You don't know the people in the business? Oh, yes, of course. Well, I'd have to look at everybody in an entirely different way. Exactly. Oh. It's a wonderful idea, Mr. Bennett. The problem is time. The option, I'm afraid, is not my doing and not my problem. My wife liked grace magazine. However, I wouldn't want to buy it and find out a day later that there's no grace Guthrie. She ran off with a fella. And there's nobody in the office. It could be gobbled up by anyone. You, and only you, know who can run that business. I will not question your selection even for a minute. Here. Signed and notarized and witnessed. Show the expert. Thank you. Just the blank you fill in, and gracehas your personal selection of a successor. Choose a young human being. Promise me to do this. Of course. I promise. Settled. Before we break up, there's something I would like to say. I know how rumors fly around here. I'd like to give you the facts. Truth is, I now have the resources with which to buy this magazine. Great! However, there are certain commitments to be made. And I assure you that I would be able to make them very easily. And then you will hear one magnificent victory speech. Lily, would you have lunch with me in my office today? Excuse me. She would never make an announcment like that unless she must have something to back it up. She got the money from somewhere. You were in her office when she got that call last night, where did she say she was going? Damn! You could've followed her. I have a lot to teach you. What's here is chaos, but something's in it. It's by Susan. And some of it is quite good, but it needs you it needs about a thousand words cut out. Won't Susan do it? Susan wrote it. Someone has to edit it. But I'm a writer. Mm-hmm. It just seems backwards. Susan is an editor and I'm a writer... And you want me to edit Susan's piece. Well... Every editor was once a writer. You'll be making that jump yourself soon. I don't know if I could work on someone else's piece. How do I know what she wants to say? I'd rather write a whole new one. We can't write new articles whenever we get one with problems, can we? No. Sorry, I... Oh. Well... Ok. Thanks, Lily. Thanks anyway. You want some more coffee? No, thank you. All right. I don't know what this is all about, but you and Susan have been shooting it out since you met. And I get that certain personalities just clash, but there's something you ought to know. What? There's a box in Susan's office with your name on it. If anyone wanted to tell your life's story, he'd be smart to take a look at that box. It's quite a tribute. Thanks for lunch. Yeah. Bye. If I understand it our benefactor wants someone under 40. Continuity. Is he all there? Grace? Sorry, Theo. What did you say? Our Mr. Bennett-- is he in command of his faculties? Absolutely. He knows exactly what he's doing. All right. We'll go outside the magazine. I've heard good things about this next young woman. [Doorbell chimes] She knows a cue when she hears one. Miss Henshaw. Oh, Mrs. Guthrie. I cannot tell you what a privilege it is to meet you. I've read every issue of graceever published, every editorial you've ever written, every page you've printed. I've no idea what this meeting is about. However, any chance to meet you after all these years of admiring you from afar-- I mean, it is such an honor! Actually, I love the mystery of it all. Excuse me. Oh, Mrs. Guthrie, I guess your deal isn't that solid, or I'd be in the cold by now. I'm just giving you some time to buy some warm mittens. I'd like to ask a favor. Yeah, what? The pictures of the military clothes-- yeah. You can get new ones, if you would like but Lily wrote dynamite copy you should read. Good. I'll send it to your office. Uh, fine. Fine. Among of inhabitants of locust valley is e.B. Bennett, buyer of lost causes. You mean she's done it? I can use a features editor on private lives magazine. No, thanks. With due respect, Mrs. Guthrie, but I'm trying to get out of fashion. Why? Frankly? Yes. It's superficial, synthetic, materialistic, and irrelevant. One big narcissistic hoax that tries to make appearences more important than reality. The only things phonier than fashion designers are the pathetic half-human models they design for. I know saying this is almost heresy, but that's the way I feel. Well... Thank you, candide. But if you want to start a political department, I'm your woman. Then extend the option. No. Four weeks! No. Two! I can't play games like that. I suppose Patrick plays by all the rules. Well, that's beside the point. You don't put a corporation up for sale, then take it down. Again it isn't done. It just ruins your standing in the business world. What do you care? You're retiring from the business world. Oh, not at this rate, I'm not. David... David, please. I have more candidates to see. And if I only had a little bit more time, I'd find somebody, I know. I'm not sure you would. Of course I would. Why wouldn't I? Because you're not a compromiser. But I'm not looking for a genius, honestly. No, you're just looking for another grace Guthrie. I don't think that is true. I'm not looking for a clone of me, am I? I don't think such a thing is possible. At any rate, we have to fill in this blank by tomorrow. Let's put Mary down. Mary? No. But Mr. Bennett wouldn't quibble over a decade or so, would he? Mary would be first to admit she can't run the magazine. As long as she doesn't admit it to Bennett. Omar, I can't just name a name. That was part of the deal. If you don't, I'll be out of the job myself when they take over. There, you see? I have a choose now of betraying Bennett or my lifelong friends and colleagues. Oh, how did I get into this mess? That's the least of the mess, my dear. You have the choice of betraying Bennett... Or turning your magazine over to the vilest man in publishing. Under the circumstances, a little white lie is expected. You know something-- the Charles Patricks of the world didn't come from nowhere. There's a marketplace out there, and they're doing better in it than we are. Now if we can't pass down our values our standrads of decensy to the next generation-- compete with the Patricks of the world-- then we are lost! Grace, you have not lost. You've won. You've done the impossible. All you have to do is write in a name. Look, you can walk in tomorrow and say your deal fell through, and your option expired, or walk in with a name right here and have everything you want. Except the truth. Weigh the pristine truth against the specter of grace in the hand of Patrick. Oh, don't. It makes me sick. There's someone, of course, who can run the magazine, and we both know it. David knew it, Patrick knows it. You know it. Susan Dawson. See you in the morning. Yeah. Thank you, Joseph. I will see you around 5:30. Good morning. Good morning. Welcome to appomattox. Ha. Which is general Grant, and which is general Lee? Well, since I'm the one about to become free-Lance, I guess I'm Lee. Come in, general. Well, I haven't been out of work since just after school. Looking forward to it. I might even write a book. Oh. Fiction? Illusion. So... To the better woman. Well, you have Mr. Bennett. Patrick's octopus of corporate intelligence confirmed it. So... I guess I'm off to buy those mittens. I should have thought you'd simply go over to another of Patrick's magazines. They're not all garbage, you know? I wouldn't be c-- you really think that, don't you? Yes. No. No, I will not simply go to one of Patrick's other magazines. I wouldn't have coffee with the man. I wanted this one because it's the best, because I might bring it into the next century. But you wouldn't even consider letting it go. You won't let it reflect anyone's image but your own. I promise you something-- one day, this magazine, which was once so lovely, will stiffen... And look up at you and die. And you'll be there, to see it too, because it's obvious you want to be sure it goes first. Miss Dawson... Suppose this is the next century, and you're not trying to get into this office, you're in it. And someone like Charles Patrick is trying to take control. And someone like you is trying to help him. What would you do? Same as you're doing... I suppose. David, read this, will you, please? I've decided to name Susan Dawson to be my successor. You're serious? Yes. We have deep differences, that's true, but she has standards of her own. They're pragmatic, but she's got them. What makes you think she'll stay? Well, if she won't, Patrick wins. Put any name in there. I can't, I can't. Why? Mr. Bennett is right. I, too, have to know that this magazine can survive without me. By cheating him and just filling in the blank, I'm only delaying the inevitable anyway. What time is Patrick due? Why would he show up at all? He knows he has your money the party is over. But if he does come, when wouldhe be here? [Intercom beeps] About now. Yes? Mr. Henderson, Mr. Patrick's on his way. Stall him. What? Stall him. Send him somewhere. Just put minnie mouse's name in. Let Bennett buy the magazine. I can't. Send him into the conference room. Oh, good morning. I was just paying a condolence call on Susan. Not a terribly good loser. I did not expected to see you tillthe big showdown. Well, I have something to do first. Just trying to prolong my agony, were you? Every chance I get. Excuse me. Can I talk with you? Actually, that's the only reason I came this morning. If we could find some privacy, do you mind? Well, I'm sorry-- do you mind?! I don't know what your terms with Bennett are, but I can beat them. I'll capitalize the entire purchase of this magazine. You stay on as boss for life if you want. Absolute authority. No interference, whatsoever. You'll never see or hear from me again. Ironclad, in writing, with a substantial salary increase and 15% of the profits. That's hard to turn down. It is, isn't it? Yes. But what about Susan Dawson? Out. I thought you said I had absolute authority. Or in, if you want her. I don't care. I know you don't. But some of US still do. What did Bennett offer you? The future. Read this. Please. I've chosen-- could I read please? Didn't you just asked me to read sorry. Me? Yes. Everybody else was that bad? No. You were that good. Well, this is all signed, sealed, and delivered. You could fill in anybody. I don't want anybody. Well, suppose I say no? Well, then I'll just be forced to, uh, compromise. You really think you can make me over? I think I can make some adjustments. And if I don't adjust? I'm betting that you will. You see, right now you think it's very exciting to tear down all the boundaries. I'll show you how to work within those boundaries. And suppose you can't? Then I'm fired? Oh, no. Now if I can't, then I failed then I'll be the one to go. But I don't like to fail. I want you to help me to take this magazine into the next century. There is nothing so out of date as an old magazine. Right? I can't say that I like you. Gilbert barely spoke to Sullivan. Who? Gilbert and Sullivan-- they were musicians. They made-- oh, never mind. It was far before your time. What do you say? It's either work with me or write that book? Oh, I'm writing it already. And you're in it. Well? Oh. Thank you. Let's go. Well, can I get a bigger office? Oh, by all means, you have so many boxes. Uh, may I? Thank you. Oh. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Well. Where's Mr. Patrick? He's gone. Gone? Yes, he says he'll buy a brand-new magazine and run you out of business. That's good. Competition. Very, very healthy. Well, sit, sit. Please. Miss Dawson. Would you like to fill in your name yourself? Mm-mmm. You do it. Uh...you do it. No. You. Thank you. Done. Susan. Come sit here. No. No. I think I'll just sit right here.
