It was my mistake. His death was not your fault. We knew others who died tragically. But he was one of us. We all make mistakes. No. Father Silva believed in saving man here on earth. I provided the wood for his coffin. I got there too late. What happened in Rio... was bad luck. Father Silva is dead. Is that just bad luck? One day I will pay for what I've done. When that day comes, God will judge you as He judges all of us. Now... receive my absolution. In nomine Patris et Filli et spiritus sancti. Amen. THE MAN FROM ROME SEVILLE, SPAIN I am here. Yes, may God's will be done. Hello. Anybody here? Father Ferro? VATICAN CITY Sorry to wake you, Father Arregui. Is this our hacker, Father Cooey? He's using thrust-and-parry moves to probe the firewall. He's no rookie. He hasn't able to penetrate, but he's eluded our purge attempts. This hacker is good. Freaking good. Source. Not trackable, the signal is bouncing through hundreds of proxy servers and then the trace route dies. He's retooling. I can't stop him. Penetrating inner security. He's in. What the devil is he looking for? VATICAN CITY THE POPE'S CHAMBER Many immigrants have been transferred to Lombardy, Veneto, Piedmont, Lazio, Campania... "In Seville, merchants threaten the church of Our Lady of the Tears and she kills to defend herself. I implore your Holiness to stand up against those who pray for the most humble sheep in your flock." Shut down. Shut down now! Power back up. Any damages, keyloggers? He broke into VO1A. VO1A. The Holy Father's computer. Left a message. Run a root diagnostic. Get me Monsignor Spada. - Eminence, something has happened. - Yes? - I'll keep you informed. - Meet me tomorrow morning. Yeah. I'll be there. Excuse me, Monsignor. His Eminence, Cardinal Iwaszkiewicz, has arrived. Eminenza. Are you aware of what's happening in Seville? With due respect, Eminenza, I delivered that report to your office, the Holy Office, personally. Holy Office? My brother in Christ, the Inquisition ended over a hundred years ago. - Forgive me, I meant to say... - "La Congregazione". It's the Congregation. La Congregazione, that's right. I hope your devotion to fixing the Church's most sensitive issues is not wavering, is it? Unwavering, Eminenza. And how are you going to manage this... hacker business? Expediently, Eminenza. His Holiness has requested the direct intervention of the Istituto. So... he has... So he has... Monsignor. Sit if you wish. Laudeatur Jesus Christus, Eminenza. It hasn't been so long, Father Quart. The Vatican Computer Network has been compromised. This message appeared on the Pope's personal computer. A church in Seville that... kills to defend herself. Yes, over the last two months, a city architect and... Archbishop Corvo's personal secretary died in that church. The church is to be demolished. So we cannot allow this to turn into a media circus about a killer church. Una chiesa assassina. We're sending you to Seville to investigate this... unfortunate death, to write a report and find out what's going on with that church. It's Holy Father's will. Which is God's will. God's will indeed. Our top cyber security expert will be at your disposal. - You mean Cooey. - Yes. - Any questions? - Your Eminences are aware that... I don't enjoy the sympathies of the Archbishop of Seville. A point clearly made by your scathing report of... security breaches when the Holy Father visited there. Archbishop Corvo is a man of the Church and put aside his personal dislikes for the higher good. We'll inform you of your assignment out of courtesy. In the meantime you're dispensed of your vow of obedience and are free to use whatever means necessary. Legitimate means. Legitimate means. Above all you must conduct this investigation with utmost discretion. And remain neutral. I'm here to help. Thank you. So what is Archbishop Corvo's position on all this? Corvo already forged an agreement with a bank that wants to develop the land where the church sits. It's a huge project. No land, no project. Unbelievable. The church's patron family has invoked age-old rights to stop demolition. It's a standoff. Why the Istituto, Monsignor? Why me? Seems a bit... Tame? Yeah. At any other time we would never get involved on a local turf war. Even the hacker business is a small matter. But with these fanatics sniffing out every opportunity to undermine this Pope, the situation of Seville could get blown out of proportion. - Iwaszkiewicz and company. - Yeah. They wax nostalgic for the Inquisition. - What's Iwaszkiewicz's agenda? - To be Pope. Does he stand a chance? Many voting Cardinals share his conservative views. He's already positioning himself for the next Conclave. - Could be a long way off, no? - Popes can retire or... die unexpectedly. Iwaszkiewicz knows we stand in his way, he's demanding loyalty. Loyalty? Mafia caliber loyalty. We've done his dirty work, he's already gained influence at our expense. Iwaszkiewicz will use any pretext to take control of the Istituto. You watch he'll start a fire and then he'll put it out. And that way, his Eminence can play arsonist and... firefighter. It's... It's a pretty brilliant plan actually. And the clock is ticking. That's why I need my best man for this job in Seville. You understand, Father Quart? - I follow my orders, Monsignor. - Yeah. So I want you to come back with a report this thick and show that figlio di puttana that we know our business and he better not mess with us. Understood. SEVILLE, SPAIN This is the Santa Cruz project. A complex of buildings built in this historical neighborhood. A unique investment opportunity. Our president, Don Octavio Machuca and the Cartujano Bank's team are proud to be the major developers of this shining star for Seville. Our independent auditor, Mr. Iker can answer any financial questions you may have. Thank you, thank you. Thank you for coming. Too complicated, Pencho. And with that feud with the wife over the church... But the numbers, forget my wife. The numbers are great and that's what matters. The numbers do look good, I can't figure out how. A little more enthusiasm would have helped, Don Octavio. Some shareholders are still on the fence. Or hoping you fall flat on your face to be more exact. I'm keeping my enthusiasm at bay. Frankly there are still major obstacles, the church... The church isn't an issue anymore. It's a death trap, demolition is imminent. Not an issue? Then why is Rome sending a priest to investigate? To avoid scandal. An old Vatican bureaucrat will shuffle in to close the investigation as quickly as he can so he can enjoy the glorious food in Seville. Really? The Mayor is on board along with the Heritage Council. This project benefits everyone. Everyone? What about Balaguer? - He wasn't buying it. - I'll handle Balaguer. Like you handled your wife? Ex-wife, Don Octavio. Ex-wife. That's what she says. NEW MESSAGE COVER YOUR TRACKS Macarena. - I knew you'd be here. - What do you want, Pencho? You're still my wife. On paper. Can't we just resolve this situation? There's nothing to resolve, it's over. Why are you hellbent on destroying my career? You don't need my help for that now, do you? Listen, listen. My promotion to bank president depends on the success of the Santa Cruz project. This has nothing to do with you, that church is my family's legacy. It's my family's history and I will do anything to save it. You're obsessed with that fucking church. Your legacy has cost two lives so far. And that's been so convenient for you and your bank. What are you saying exactly. - That you are capable of anything. - So are you. Okay, okay, okay, I'll double the offer. It'll be enough for you and your mother to live for the rest of your lives. Stooping to a bribe, Pencho? You are not in good form today. Now if you'll excuse me... That church will be razed! You'll regret you didn't take the money. LUXURIOUS APARTMENT BUILDINGS, SHOPPING MALLS SEVILLE ARISTOCRACY EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS SECOND DEATH IN "OUR LADY OF TEARS", THE CHURCH TO BE DEMOLISHED Padre Quart, so good to see you again. It's a pleasure to have you in... in Seville. Word came down from the big guns on your joining this investigation. Superintendent Navajo, you got promoted, congratulations. Yes, thank you. Thanks so much. Well, God is good. And... anytime you decide to surrender that collar for a badge, just... let me know. - Straight to the church, right? - See? I know you. You got a new car. Yes, it's... it came with the raise. This is from the Nunciature in Madrid. And two pistols. This is your license to carry here. - That's on me. - Thanks. So you're sure there's been no foul play? Padre, we are the police, so we live and breathe foul play. But even I have to wonder what we missed when... the Istituto comes sniffing around, if you know what I mean. Here is the file. And... No, no, that's a file from a different case. Sorry about that. - Who was he? - A prostitute. The body washed up on the river bank last night. A single shot. A single shot stippling and close range. I think it was an execution. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if it's the church itself or mere chance or the archangels, but there is something sinister about that place. I mean, we all know how the city inspector died. Right, it says here that he was up on a ledge taking photographs to support a condemnation order. He stepped on a loose slab and that's all it took. Fuck! Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry and sorry. What about the other death, Archbishop Corvo's secretary. Father Urbizu. A pulley from the scaffold fell... right on his head. Killed him instantly. There it is. Surveillance cameras. From on the street, nothing... relevant. Any other exits? Yes, there is one from the priest quarters to the street. It opens up to a small patio. I'll drop off your bags at your hotel on my way. - You good here on your own, Padre? - Always. Good grief! You scared me! I apologize. I'm Father Quart. Sorry, I've been a little jumpy lately. Gris Marsala, the architect in charge of restoring this beauty. I pictured a little bald man in a cassock with a briefcase full of missals and crucifixes. - Sorry to disappoint. - It's all right. So the Archbishop said that I was coming. Yep. Doesn't seem to like you very much. - Don't believe everything you hear. - Yeah. You are American, right? Been here two years. It doesn't say much for my skills, not does it? On the contrary. Well, in my defense, restoration's been moving at a snail's pace since notice came down that Our Lady of Tears was beyond repair - and the Archdiocese pulled funding. - Don't seem so bad. It's old and neglected but the structural sound... There was some water damage mostly to internal walls. We fixed that. Where I come from... this would be a protected historical treasure that nobody could touch. Well, maybe there are just one too many churches around here. That sounds strange. Strange? Well, coming from a priest. I was joking. Now, of course the deaths have made things worse. Right, you mean the accidents? Yes, you can call them that. Yes. The accidents. Father Oscar, our assistant priest. Much of the progress we've made it's because of him. Thank you. Were you aware that the... scaffolding was not safe? Are you accusing me of something, Father? No, it's just a question. And is the church still open to the public? Yes, why? Well, two deaths in two months. Conditions seem hazardous, even you could be at risk. So the Vatican would rather see us evicted than help. I'm just here to write a report. Come on. Father. Light, please. Well, here it is. 18th century Baroque. With an altarpiece by Pedro Duque Cornejo. She's beautiful. No, she's more than that. Sculpted by Juan Martínez Montañés, the god of the wood. Her tears are twenty perfect pearls brought from the Americas in the 1800s. The rest of the story lies in the crypt. Over there. Generations of the Dukes of the Nuevo Extremo... are buried here. "Orderint dum probent." "Let them hate me, so long as they respect me." Gaspar Bruner de Lebrija. He ceded the land for this church and the convent in 17th century. The Bruner family still holds rights to the property with a caveat. Rights are forfeited if mass for Gaspar's soul isn't held here every Thursday. That's some caveat. Why Thursdays? The day he died. - Father Ferro, this is... - I know who he is. My church is not for sale. No one's here to buy your church, Father. I'm the Vatican special envoy. My credentials. I don't give a damn about your credentials. Friendly. Well, don't judge him from what you just saw. He normally is... I'm not here to judge. He's under so much pressure. If it hadn't been for him... the church would have been long gone. How invested is Father Ferro in the church? No, let's put it this way. If they succeed in tearing it down... they'll have to do it with him inside. He said you're here to make sure there's a... swift execution. And what do you think? My opinion is not important, Father. Well, it was a pleasure. The pleasure was mine. Thank you, Father. So that's the envoy from Rome. I didn't realize you were already here. Here... and watching. So? What do you think? Well, he sure doesn't look like a priest. No. POSTCARD "I come here every day to pray for your safe return to the sacred place where you swore your love and gave me such happiness. I will always love you, Carlota." AND DROVE ALL FROM THE TEMPLE COURTS... "STOP TURNING MY FATHER'S HOUSE INTO A MARKET!" Listen, I've done everything you asked. I want my payback. The five million does different, that's embezzlement. No, I cannot hide it forever. Put the money back and everything will be okay. A security company installed two concealed cameras this morning. Monsignor Spada's order. After the break-in yesterday. I've connected the hotel surveillance system too. - Connect? - You know what I mean, Father. Semantics I guess. Okay, wave. Bye. Right, I'm off. Don't leave that spot. - Father Quart. - Archbishop Corvo. Your Grace. As you know, I am here to write a report. An unbiased report, yes I know all about your reports. Well, the facts are very simple. The church of Our Lady of Tears, is in ruins. And it would be to the greater good that we... dispose of that run down asset. The Cartujano Bank has made a very generous offer which will greatly benefit my Archdiocese, this Archdiocese. And perhaps make your Archdiocese the wealthiest in Spain. That is an exaggeration. I do not understand why the Vatican is going to so much trouble. Well, an Archbishop demolishing a sacred church, removing a much-loved parish priest just to fill his own coffers... Is not a good look. A parish priest who is uneducated, uncouth, stubborn as a mule. There's an ancient privilege from 1687 granted by one of my illustrious predecessors. I know about the Thursday mass. Well, maybe then you also know that Macarena Bruner, a descendant, - is defiantly defending the church. - Motivated by her devotion, surely. She is devoted lately to... scandalizing high society in Seville. She flaunts her sins but she is clearly attached to this decrepit church. MACARENA BRUNER CAUGHT WITH FLAMENCO DANCER "MAESTRAL" And what I do not understand is... - why Sister Gris is a friend of hers. - Sister Gris? The American architect. - She's a nun, I didn't realize. - She is. What was your secretary doing in the church? I'm sure you have read the case files. The police... were very thorough. I know, I just wanted to hear it from you. Father Urbizu was sent to deliver a letter suggesting that the statue of the Virgin be brought here for safekeeping, of course. Of course. The police found no evidence of foul play. Divine intervention. Don't act the fool with me, Father Quart. A haunted church is the last thing we need. Well, now that you and the Vatican have stepped in, I'm just an observer. Good luck. Thank you. Father Quart, what a coincidence. Pencho Gavira, Vice President of the Cartujano Bank. Nice to meet you. I'll get right to the point, Father. I hope Rome sees the advantages of retiring Our Lady of Tears. I don't think this is the time or the place, Mr. Gavira. Father. I care about the church and its parishioners. I really do, but... it's not safe, it needs to be relocated. - Everyone agrees. - Everyone? Well, you'll have to excuse me, I'm running late. Father Quart. A lady is waiting for you, over there. Father Quart, Macarena Bruner. Please forgive me for showing up like this, without an appointment. No, it's fine I was going to come see you anyway. You've done me a favor. So, should we go somewhere more private? I know you're a busy man, Father, and I won't waste your time. The powers that be, deny funds to repair a church my family built over three centuries ago. Certain city leaders want to demolish the church and use the land for a development project. Your husband. You've met? In passing. He also knew where to find me. You're here to settle in favor of the Archbishop and the bank as quickly as possible, correct? No, no, I'm not here to settle anything. I'm just here to write a report about the deaths in the church and I will take as much time as I need. What do you know about the deaths? Terrible accidents that... wouldn't have happened if the funds to repair the church hadn't been taken away as a ploy to force demolition. Our Lady of Tears is important to many people. So is Father Ferro. I understand, but there are other factors, you know? - Personal interests can't always be... - Father Ferro is not thinking of himself. And what about you? It doesn't matter, you wouldn't understand. Try me. Do you want a confession? Well, I'm not here in that capacity. But maybe. Lunch tomorrow at... one? Sure. I will look forward to it, Miss Bruner. Please, call me Macarena. UNKNOWN NUMBER Schedule a meeting with Machuca, first thing tomorrow. Pencho. Hello mother. You're getting up later and later. Oh you know that I'm a night owl. - How did it go with your priest? - He's not my priest. Oh... Sister Gris says he's too good looking to be a priest. Really? Father Quart confirmed he's here to investigate the deaths in the church. What else did he say? We only met briefly but we're meeting for lunch tomorrow. Really? That is very interesting. Sister Gris Marsala's early service coincided with the uprisings in Chiapas. Later she worked with a foundation supporting women in Juarez, Mexico. Social justice activist. Arrested but no details. Her restoration credentials are pretty impressive. She went on to work at a college in Santa Barbara, California, but left three years ago. Any luck with Archbishop Corvo's email account? - I'm keeping tabs on his Grace. - Don't let me down. Are you on? Okay. That's one powerful laptop. Connect the device to a usb port. I'll take over. Bossy. Okay, done. You can move on. Father Cooey. I need you to pull up as much information about Father Ferro as possible. A deep dive. You got it. Holding my breath. I've gone over the pros and cons. It's a promising project. I want to be part of it. No reservations. You'll help persuade the others? My opinion carries weight, Pencho. I also want you to know that you can count on my support for your bid to replace Don Octavio. Once you retire, Sir. Excuse me gentlemen, I have an appointment. What's up with Balaguer? Lost your way, Father Quart? Just doing my job. Those are private quarters, oh but you know that. Well, men of the cloth work and live for the church so if they've nothing to hide... Doesn't everyone? Sister Gris. You can drop the title. What happened in Juarez? Bravo, you have done your homework. In Juarez... dozens of women disappear or are brutally killed every day. We were protesting in the streets. I was detained with others. An officer got me alone. Tried to rape me. I fought. He pulled a knife. He said next time he'd cut deeper. I'm sorry. You're a brave soul. Do you really believe that this church is worth saving? I mean, this the building, not... what it represents. You mean its architectural value. Yeah. Our Lady of Tears is... it's one of a kind. She's an example of... a pure baroque neoclassical sobriety. A rare exception to the conventional styles of the time. I think you know what I mean, Father. In any case, at all costs she must be preserved. Thank you. I'm pleased you came. I want you to trust me. It would be easier to confide in you if I knew you better. - What do you want to know? - Everything. Why did you join the priesthood? The truth. Well, I was born in Ireland and my father was a fisherman. One day he sailed away and never came back and... my mother thought it would be better if I joined the army or the church than end up somewhere at the bottom of the sea. A regimented life, so... no calling, just a gentle push. Then I went to the seminary and the Vatican offered me a diplomatic career, so... here I am, being diplomatic. Tell me before seminary. Guess. Military. A soldier. I could see that. Were you ever in love? I lost someone that I loved, very much. So, your turn. - No, but you just got started, no. - No, no, no. Okay. In college I majored in History and Women's Studies and actually right now I'm working on a book about the role of women in the Spanish Court. After graduation my mother gave me the Dukedom of Azahara, a title I don't use. Plus one day I will inherit another thirty or so pompous titles that... won't pay the bills. Do you mind if I ask you how your marriage ended? It was a gradual erosion. A profound deception. But you you're not divorced, technically. I'm catholic. Of course. Thank you. You still have not told me what you think about the church deaths. What I know is the effects that have on the people in Seville. At first that the church was at death trap and had to be turned down. Then that it must remain standing to avoid the wrath of God. Giving... literally everybody connected to the church a motive. They were accidents. Why are you fighting this battle? Our Lady of Tears is all that is left of the Bruners, so... I don't have a choice. It's a battle against time and oblivion. My mother, the Duchess, would love to meet you but she hardly ever leaves the house, so... will you join us for breakfast tomorrow? At Casa del Postigo. - I'd love to! - Great! Let me give you the address over here. At nine. Perfect. Nice car. Thank you. I have an appointment with the Archbishop. Sounds fun! Why does he call you a scalp hunter? - It's a long story. - See you tomorrow. Yes, I'll get the information as soon as possible. Shit! Father Cooey, I brought your mail. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Chewing gum. Thank you. STRANGE SUICIDE IN S&amp;B CONSULTING FIRM Quart, go ahead. Father Quart, there are two men in your room. - Yep. - The priest is back, get out. Come on! Get up! On Father Oscar's laptop I found e-mails between him and the Archbishop right after he was transferred to Our Lady of Tears. And it seems he was on a mission to oust Father Ferro. He might have switched sides. And I also went through Archbishop Corvo's email accounts. - What? - As requested by Father Quart. I didn't authorize that. I know but it paid off, Monsignor. Someone's been blackmailing Archbishop Corvo. Monsignor, the hacker is back. He's looking into the INMAVAT network again. He's doing the same as before. He hides his entry point by jumping from one network to another. What am I seeing here? A honey-pot. A decoy system, to the hacker it looks like the real thing. If he takes the bait, he will leave a trail we can follow. - And he's going really fast. - Because he knows the way. There he goes. He's getting in, one more click. Yeah. VO1ATS. Thank God. - Thank you. - You're welcome. The Dove tower. When I was a little girl, that was my favorite place to be. It was where my great aunt Carlota, waited for her lover to return. Carlota? Oh my God! - What happened? - It's... It's complicated. Sorry, I can't talk about it. Okay, more mystery. - It suits you. - Thanks. Come, I want to show you something. I curled up in that sofa and read letters from my great aunt Carlota to her lover, Captain Xaloc. Captain Xaloc... A sailor who had no money or social status. Her father, my great-grandfather refused to let them marry. So Xaloc sailed to the Americas to make his fortune promising to return to get his blessing. What happened? Carlota wrote these love letters - praying for a response. - Do you have his letters? No, her father burned them. She never knew Xaloc wrote to her. Soon she realized she was pregnant. When the baby was born while she was asleep... her father took him away and she never saw her son again. She went insane. Not long after... Xaloc returned a rich man. But it was too late. Carlota had no idea who he was. Xaloc was torn apart and went back to sea... leaving behind the wedding gift he had brought from the Americas. A strand of perfect pearls. One night. Carlota stepped off this window ledge to her death. Her father, overcome with grief and guilt, had the pearls embedded into our statue of the Virgin. Our Lady of Tears. Legend says that on moonlit nights, Carlota sits right here waiting for her lover to return. Sounds like you have a bond with Carlota. Carlota was a young romantic who lived in an artificial world. One day, she met a real man and she could not resist. We should go down. So, who's the scientist? That's Father Ferro's telescope. Ferro... I would never have guessed. He's here six nights a week. To observe Heaven, he says. And those are coordinates of the stars he studies. These are not coordinates. Let's go. I hope the other guy looks much worse. Father Quart, my mother the Duchess. Your Grace. Father Ferro prefers no one touches his books. Of course. Breakfast will be on the patio. I'm curious to know... how has restoration on the church continued without... funds from the Archdiocese or the city? Well, we offer what we can from... my pension. And Father Ferro works very hard to find funding. You both seem very fond of him. Well, he's family. And what about Sister Gris, is she family too? We are so fortunate to have her here, - despite... - Mother! - Please. - Let me say what I have to say. Gris suffered a personal crisis. We used to believe that nuns and priests did not have... personal problems. But I read on the internet that their... sorrows are much more frequent than one would... imagine. Even the Holy Father is not immune. On the internet? On Macarena's computer. It's like having the whole world at your fingertips. Such a gift... from the Holy Spirit. I'm so sorry. You'll have to excuse me, ladies. Duty calls. It's been delightful. The pleasure has been ours, Father. Macarena. Take care of yourself, Father. Well, he was certainly worth getting up early for. Now I must do some work. The role of a Duchess is not everything that meets the eye. As you will learn someday, when the baton passes to you. I've heard that before. A tattoo... Yes. And we have seen that tattoo before. This is a video of the apparent suicide of Imanol Iker at S&amp;B. You know, the international consulting firm. - Yeah, I saw the headline. - The light in the area was broken. So surveillance camera couldn't pick up much. - You think it was staged? - Sloppy job, watch for the muzzle flash. So, same tattoo? Or an unbelievable coincidence. It's not a coincidence. But what's the connection between Our Lady of Tears and Iker's death. Cartujano Bank. S&amp;B Consulting did some work for them. Wow. A word of caution, Padre. The bank president, Octavio Machuca is a very, very powerful man. What do we know about the other two? No... No hits yet, still digging. Sorry. We got him. He's a black hat hacker. From Râmnicu Vâlcea, Romania. Hackerville, of course. So he hates developers. No, he just loves money. Plays poker online, - I'm texting you a photo now. - Any connection with the church? No, he said he was paid by a poker chat room. "Queen of the South". Queen of the South... Yeah, whoever he, she or they are, will know sooner or later. And what about Ferro. He's hiding something. He's just a stubborn old priest. You've crossed paths with his type before. Forget Ferro. Focus on the Cartujano Bank's trail, understood? We'll find out who the hacker works for, close the circle and get you back to Rome. We're running out of time. Monsignor. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Sister Gris. Is she on your hit list too? You do your job, Father, and I'll do mine. - Don't equate your work with mine. - You don't know anything about my work. I know your kind all too well. Priests who've lost touch with the people. The kind without a shred of humanity or compassion. Have you ever given bread to the poor? Or solace to the sick? Or the hope of redemption to a sinner? You're wrong about me. We serve the same Church, you and I. You tell yourself the story you want to hear. You follow orders nothing more. - I obey. - Do you? Congratulations. Those who obey go to heaven to rejoice in God's presence. I wonder. Should I question your faith, Father? What does it matter whether I have faith or not? So long as those who come to see me have faith! You see these pews? As long as someone is kneeling there in search of hope or consolation, then churches like this and priests like me are needed. Faith, Father Quart? Why don't you ask yourself the same question. Father Quart. Your Grace. So any idea who leaked the story of the pearls to the press? Surely you are not accusing me. Quite a coincidence. I'm summoned here, two men break into my hotel room, steal information, and today front page news. You are hanging from a slender thread for your irreverence. Tread lightly, Father Quart. And there's nothing else you want to tell me? All right. I know Pencho Gavira is blackmailing you with a list of priests in your jurisdiction accused of sexual misconduct, your Grace. That is a simple favor, making me aware. Is that a euphemism? I have a holy duty to protect my Archdiocese. By covering up the truth. Nothing but allegations, and you know how that works, don't you? You are an outsider here, Father Quart. Remember that. I know what is going on at the Vatican. Another sexual abuse scandal will not best serve any Holy Father's cause. I also know what happened in Brazil to Father Silva. That was one of your assignments too, wasn't it? Enter. Macarena. What a pleasant surprise. Your Grace. I came to make sure that you are not part of Pencho's scheme to justify the demolition of our church. Excuse me. Quart. Go ahead. My dear Macarena, I understand you are upset for what has happened this morning in the press. Father. Father Príamo Ferro served in a parish in Ucraine attached to the Diocese of Lviv. When I called to confirm, they told me he died - and was buried over forty years ago. - What? Good work, Father Cooey. Keep this under your hat for now. Listen I need you to come here to Seville asap. Don't tell anyone. I'll take full responsibility. Why not just test the authenticity of the pearls? With all due respect, your Grace, I claim the right to refuse that test. The pearls are a historical and sacred family relic. Macarena, my dear, but the pearls are... registered to the inventory of the Archdiocese. Neither my family nor Father Ferro will be smeared by this scheme. Don't forget Your Grace, that the privilege to the church, still belongs to the Bruners. No one will ever forget that. I will contact reporters. I'm sure they will be eager to hear my side of the story. Now if you'll excuse me. She's a strong woman. You know I'd think twice about giving Pencho Gavira a long leash. He'll hang you with it. Corvo will put Father Ferro on leave until the problem with the pearls is resolved. With Ferro gone, there won't be the mandatory mass on Thursday. Corvo will make sure of that. And Macarena just sits on her hands... Leave her to me. Really? She has already told several newspapers that we have orchestrated the London auction house scandal. But when it's confirmed that the pearls are fake. Your wife is refusing to allow the pearls be authenticated. The fight could last a long time. The general board meeting is in two days. I have already announced that I am submitting my resignation. Fuck! Fuck indeed! If this mess is not resolved by the board meeting your promotion is in limbo. And that's not all. Corvo says the priest from Rome is dangerous. If there are any loose ends... I don't leave loose ends. Father Cooey. - Come on in. - Hello. Nice room. Let's hope it's more secure than the last hotel. I must admit, Father, I'm nervous about all this. Yeah, you should be. We need to set up a secure server, we can't trust anyone. One good thing, no one saw me leave. Good. Monsignor Spada disappeared... after the meeting with Cardinal Iwaszkievicz. How do you know that? I just know, okay? Okay. I need you to get into the Vatican classified files. Can you do that? With all Christian humility, Father, if I can't, nobody can. But the files in level 5 are encrypted and... that could take longer. Let's just take a look at Monsignor Spada's computer. - No, you're joking. - Just a shortcut. If it works... Bingo. H. Cobs. What is that, that rings a bell. H. Cobs it seems to be an anagram. H. Cobs. H. Cobs equals Bosch. Open it. With all due respect, you could have done it much better, Monsignor. Bosch was an Istituto agent. Wow, look at that: expertise in computer science. Specialized training in intelligence. Expert in banking and economics. Fluent in five languages, this is so cool. He was one of us. His last assignment was to find covert operations in the Vatican Bank associated with the Mafia's Ambrosiano Bank scandal. And while he was at it, he found a large number of numbered secret accounts. No statements, no names, no paper trails. Mafia, drug cartels, rogue regimes, tax evaders, money laundering. Oh, what the hell... Even dormant accounts that dated back to the Second World War. Looted Holocaust assets. Geez! We are talking humongous sums of money at current value. They bypassed the bank security system and changed the codes - so they couldn't control the money. - Genius! Genius! Look, there is a letter from the then Istituto Director, reporting a leak in the investigation. If this information had come to light, it would have posed an existential threat to the Church's financial well-being. And to Bosch's life. This says he was the victim of an assassination attempt. Father Bosch, he went missing. Days later his car fell off a cliff on Autostrada A25. The flames incinerated his vehicle and body. The Istituto took over the investigation and assigned another senior agent. Spada. Father Cooey, can you digitally process that photo, to see what Father Bosch would look like today? Sure. Piece of cake. Okay. You see what I see, right? Right. - Holy Toledo. - Yeah. No, no, no. I'm a geek, not a gunslinger. We're dealing with seriously dangerous people who would not think twice about killing you. You know how to use it? I watch movies. Track my GPS. Activate the emergency signal. Yes. - Don't open the door to anyone. - Right. - I said don't open the door. - Okay. Yes. - My brother in Christ. - My dear friend. I didn't expect to meet you until we were conducted to the gates of heaven. To take possession of eternal joys. Well, in my case I'm not so sure. Here, I brought you a coffee. I mean I love the coffee here, it's... it's fantastic. Thank you, Paolo. I want you to know, I had nothing to do with the deaths or the messages. I've spent forty years keeping my promise to you. Silence. I've never doubt of you, my friend. I owe you my life. We've been through a lot together. What happened with the pearls? Simple really. The Bruners had exhausted the family funds restoring the church. So Macarena sold them in London. That explains a lot. We replaced them with fakes. Even the Virgin Mary didn't notice. The pearls are a problem. They've become public. And Pencho Gavira, he's a piece of work. He's blackmailing Archbishop Corvo to go along with the demolition. He claims he has a list of priests that he suspects of sex abuse. Father Quart is on it. He'll contain the bank. And I make a promise to keep Our Lady in place. - Father Quart... - Wait, wait... No, I know what you're gonna say. Believe me. You two have a lot more in common than you think, really. It's time. It's time for you to step aside. I wish I could change things, but... I need you to make this sacrifice... now. We will relocate you to avoid attracting attention. From the Congregation. Yes, you know. Cardinal Iwaszkiewicz, right? I mean, if it got out to the Polish Cardinal or to anyone that I let you disappear with those bank codes and we covered it up for forty years, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!, I'd be back in Boston working at my brother's foundry as a blacksmith. Oh yes, yes! - And you... - I'd be cutting vines. Well... Everything comes full circle. Let things take their course. Talk to the Pope. He's a good man. He will set things straight. But that would expose you. I'm too old to care what happens to me. Let's pray, Paolo. Let's pray together. Yes. Let's pray together. But before we ask God's help I need to ask you, my brother. Where are the codes? Where's Father Ferro? I need to speak to him. - Not here. - Where are you going? Archbishop Corvo ordered an immediate transfer for Father Oscar to a parish in the desert of Tabernas. - What? - Yeah, his train leaves in an hour. I hope you're happy. Because of you, Corvo can finally get rid of Father Ferro. I had nothing to do with that. Yes! Oh no! Yes, you did. You did not lift a finger to help us. Sin of omission, Father. You put Father Ferro into Corvo's hands. Damn you! Hey, hey, stop it! What are you doing? Don't! Get up! - Okay? - I'm okay. I'm sorry, I... I lost my mind. Look, I did find evidence that Father Ferro and Macarena had sold the pearls. But I did not tell a soul, I promise. I think... Father Ferro might be in danger. I have to speak to him. - Danger? - Yeah. Look, if you know where he is, you have to tell me, please. Casa del Postigo. Thank you. Are you okay? I am so sorry to disturb you, Señora. I'm looking for Father Ferro. He's not here, Father. It's a emergence that I talk to him tonight. He'll probably be here soon. It's so awful what's happening! Yes, it's very unfortunate. If all else fails, the church will... surely defend herself again, yes? Is it okay if I wait for him in the tower? As you wish. Good evening, Father. Is Father Ferro with you? No. I saw the light and thought he was here. You know, he never misses his nightly observations. I think I'll wait for him downstairs, in the garden. Well, actually he never comes this late. Macarena, I know about the pearls. What do you mean? You told me how much they meant to you. Must have been difficult for you to sell them. You cannot have everything. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices. I want you to know that my recommendation will be to leave the church in place. Maybe you'll get what you want. You'll save Our Lady of Tears, and get even with your husband. You think this is about revenge? You have no idea why I left Pencho. I don't need to know why. - The report, the only thing that I... - Oh God, your damn report! Are you always so detached? I will never have what I want. Never. I wanted a child. And Pencho kept putting it off. "It's too soon, it's about time." But I wasn't getting any younger. So I stopped taking birth control. You got pregnant. Pencho was crazy angry for some reason I will never understand. I was depressed, not thinking straight. And I... let him talk me into... What? Tell me. Pencho took me to one of those clinics in Madrid. Well, he practically pushed me through the door. And there were complications. And now I can't have children. One day, not long after that... I woke up and saw Pencho as a complete stranger. I knew I didn't love him anymore. And why am I telling you this? You don't know what it's like to lose in one instant your future and your past. I do know... what that's like. We all have pain that we have to live with. But in time... the wounds scar over and it makes you stronger. Where do you get your composure? Or is it fake? Who needs a gun to be a tough guy. Monsignor. Why don't you clean up and meet me downstairs at the restaurant. I hope they have decent food. Monsignor. You know the coffee here is... excellent. One coffee, please. So how did you find me? Well, it was easier than it should've been. Why didn't you tell me about Father Ferro's true identity? You knew that I'd get to the truth eventually. Father Bosch is an old friend. I was hoping for resolution without revelation. But that's impossible, there's always revelation. Faith is nuanced. To live a life of faith is like floating in a river of ambiguity. At some point in time you'll have to make a choice. And I know you'll make the right choice. But for now... let's focus on the mission. So what do we know? The Cartujano Bank's auditor, Iker, cooked the books to make the Santa Cruz project look more attractive to investors. The Santa Cruz project is a front. Iker got himself killed because he... uncovered a massive money laundering scheme that Gavira has been running for Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs. Who else in the bank is involved? The president and the board of directors are clueless. That's why Gavira is so determined to be president of the bank, just to use a position of power he can easily cover up criminal activity. Right. The deeper we dig, the uglier it gets. What do you mean? Iker started extorting money from Pencho... Oh my God. ...and he became disposable. I guess he underestimated what Pencho was capable of. Underestimating your enemy. Big mistake. Guess he didn't have The Art of War on his bookshelf. Okay, the big question. The deaths in the church. Are they accidents... or murder? At this point, I just don't know. But we're on it. Okay, okay, good. I'm back to Rome. The Polish Cardinal doesn't even know I'm gone. There's a revolt brewing. And I have to protect the Pope. - That bad, huh? - Oh yes. It's getting medieval. But... at least we're not dripping poison into each other's chalices. - Yet. - Yeah. God bless. What's gonna happen to Father Bosch? Leave him to me. What does that mean exactly? If I may ask. It means... leave him to me. Yeah? This makes three, Padre. Come. This way. Strange place to die, right? It's one of the men that tried to break into my hotel room. His name is Fazil. Sister Gris and a worker found him this morning. - Cause of death? - Initial findings suggest internal injuries and blunt trauma to the head. This... This was in his pocket. He climbed the scaffold, tried to reach the pearls, fell, hit his head and then dragged himself to the confessional. Fell or... was pushed. And then dragged into the confessional. Maybe whoever did it wanted to send a message. A place of guilt and repentance. This makes it worse for the suspect. We already have a suspect? Padre, let's not deny what is obvious. The pearls are fakes, and we know who sold the good ones. Ferro is the only person who hasn't shown his face so far. Maybe Fazil's boss sent him to the church to cause problems. He benefits from his death. - By killing one of his own men? - Wouldn't be the first time. I think Ferro's motive for wanting this guy dead - is more than clear. - Father! Father... - Father Quart. Dear God! - What is it? I can't believe this is happening again. When I came in this morning, everything seemed perfectly normal. I was praying before I start working, so I... I went down to the altar. That's... That's when I saw that poor man. Where's Father Ferro? Where is he? I haven't seen him since yesterday afternoon. But police searched his room. He hasn't been there all night. Dead man's phone. I found it before I called the police. I thought you might find it useful. This could get you into a lot of trouble. Well, wouldn't be the first time. You need to see this. Father Ferro was here. The door from the aisle to the sacristy was left open and... I sent some of my people to the Bruner's home and he hasn't been there. - I have to go. - Where are you going? Friendly reminder, Padre. This is now a criminal investigation and... it's under my jurisdiction. - I know. - Strictly, okay. - I'll be in touch. - Thank you. So... you sleep with priests now. - What are you doing here? - Dancers are not exciting enough? What are you doing here? - Too easy to seduce? - Get the hell out of my house! I warned you about Ferro. He conned you into selling your aunt's pearls. It was my idea. Oh wow, how inspired of you. I used to feel sorry for you. But now I just despise you. When Ferro turns up, if he turns up, - he'll be charged with murder. - Father Ferro is not a murderer! And he wouldn't run away. You son of a bitch. Where is he? Don't you dare hurt him! Let me tell you what you're going to do to keep him safe. I need a document drawn up by your lawyers stating that your family will sell your rights to church to the Cartujano Bank. Make it clear this is of your own free volition. We don't want any allegations or coercion flying around later. Have the document in my hands before my board meeting. You have until nine o'clock tomorrow morning. What have you done? You left me no choice. Father? Don't give in to them. Macarena, don't do it! Father? Father! I'm doing what I have to do. I'm a victim here too. Someone screwed me over and I'll do whatever I have to do to survive. Don't go to the police! Don't talk to that fucking priest from Rome. - Get the document drawn up! - Try that with me. Speak of the devil... Father. We were just talking about you. I'll leave you two alone. That vow of chastity working out for you, Father? Pencho has Father Ferro. - Where? Where is he? - I don't know. But if we don't turn over our rights by the board meeting tomorrow at nine, he's threatening to hurt him. That is not going to happen. Yes? Monsignor, you need to know that Kolja is downloading. Father Cooey's research about Seville at Cardinal Iwaszkievicz's request. Thank you, Father, I'll be there soon. Consider the consequences if all this is leaked. Your Holiness. Monsignor Spada. His Holiness was briefed about the Vatican Bank's long-standing hidden, encrypted accounts. Information that the Istituto concealed. It's been reported that you, Monsignor, years ago staged the death of an agent and... allowed him to disappear with a great deal of money. May I speak, Eminences? The details of all this will be forthcoming in a report. You've crossed the line again, Monsignor Spada. All the money remains in the Vatican Bank. It was never taken by a said agent. I will now be left alone to reflect on these grave issues. With the guidance of the Holy Spirit, I will announce my decisions before... the Permanent Pontifical Assembly tomorrow. You may adjourn. Monsignor Spada. Would you be so kind as to stay? Talk to me, Father. I called someone named Román from the phone Sister Gris gave you, but no answer. A burner. Using triangulation on the phone's GPS I tracked all locations where cell phones were pinging. And I'm guessing this must be Román's. And it's active right now on this dock in the river. - Go back to the photo of the boat. - Okay. There. That's where he is. You're a saint. Hardly, Father. Not yet anyway but I have my moments. Don't go alone, ask the police for help. I'm guessing Pencho has a mole inside the police department. Nobody can be trusted. How about Navajo? Nobody. Okay, give me that gun. Why don't we just kill the old man toss his body overboard and be done with it. Orders are orders. After nine tomorrow, you can do the honors. For now we're gonna move from here. I don't like to be in the same place for a long time. There's interference, I have to be closer. Copy that. That's right, make it tighter you fool. That way when the police find my body. They will know I didn't drown myself. That's the plan, right? Amateurs... When and if they find you. The water will have erased all the evidence. You'll be a crazy old priest that committed suicide. We should move the boat now. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Are your hurt? - Save yourself, Father. - Can you walk? Yeah. Wait here. I'll be back. Motherfucker! Throw your gun in the water! We lucked out, really. You want to thank me now for having you followed? This was found on Fazil's body. Tampering with evidence and withholding information, are we? I know. You will take full credit for solving this case, my friend. Believe me I will, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. Dominus noster Jesus Christus te absolvat... et ego auctoritate ipsius te absolvo... Monsignor Spada... is waiting for this. Thank you, Father. ALL UNDER CONTROL. STILL 9:00A.M? YES. He's a priest of strong convictions and morals. He's under my protection. The Istituto per le Opere Esteriore will remain fully operative and independent. Monsignor Spada has been reconfirmed as its director. Good afternoon, Señora. Thanks for the postcard that you left for me. By the way, I wouldn't bother contacting your Romanian poker playing hacker again, Duchess. Or should I call you Queen of the South? I only wanted to get the Holy Father's attention when the situation at Our Lady of Tears became dire. Don't worry, the secret's safe with me. Duchess. Father. I just came to say goodbye. We're so grateful, Father. I'd like you to hear me in confession. Please, Father Quart. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. May God be in your heart to help you confess your sins with true sorrow. I believe I had something to do with the deaths. I... could have warned the... municipal... architect... before he went up there and... and stepped on the broken slab. But... something stopped me, I can't... I can't explain what happened. All I know is that afterwards I... I wasn't sorry. And Archbishop Corvo's secretary? No. No, I did not mean to kill Father Urbizu. No. He... He's stopped where he shouldn't have and I... I just... I just... just wanted to scare him. What about... Fazil? When I came back later that day because you said Father Ferro was in danger, I was worried. I went to his room and he was there just writing a sermon. So I decided to... stay and wait for him and work. That's when that man came in. He didn't see me, so I... I watched, I watched him. The wheels were unlocked and I... I... I tried to lock them. I... I was petrified. I ran away. Maybe... I was a vehicle of a higher power, right? - What are you gonna do, Father? - You know that I... can't... I can't reveal what I hear in confession. But I'm a catholic and I'm a nun. And have you repented? Do you believe in the absolution? Well, there's sin and there's crime. And... not all sins are crimes, right? Right? So, what I did... That's between you and God, Sister. - I absolve you of your sins. - No. - I absolve you of your sins... - No, no. ...in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. No. No.
