Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Come! Come here. Hi. Excuse me, I found this dog on the road. Do you know whose it is? Are you the Vimero? No, I'm Antonio. Good afternoon. How are you? I found a dog and I thought... Not from here. It's not from Quintanar. If somebody abandoned it, the dog is no good anymore, so don't look for the owner. Do you know where Mantec贸n Street is? Mantec贸n isn't a street. It's a road. Go that way until you leave town. You'll see a driveway on the right. And at the end, the house you're looking for. How do you know I'm looking for a house? Because it's the only one in town for rent. And you don't look like the type who has friends in Quintanar. Thank you. THE HOUSE OF SNAILS Come. Come! Antonio? Berta? Good memory. How's your first impression, do you like it? Good, the house looks good from the outside. The town, I don't know. Until Midsummer Festival, then you'll see. The building is over two centuries old, so if you hear the wood creak at night, don't be frightened. Shall we? This way, please. This is incredible. I knew you would really like this library. You said you wanted something inspiring and traditional... so I thought of this house that's been empty for years. Many years? But not because of any problem. We've brought everything up to date. It has drinking water, electricity, a gas heater... This town is very small and renting out a house like this, even just for a month, is good money for the municipality. Right. If the heads bother you, we can put them away. Some people say they feel like the animals are watching them, but anyway... As long as they don't make conversation. Like I was saying, it has electricity, a new water heater... Everything you need, sir. Don't call me sir. Okay... Right... Everything you need. Well... Shall we sign? But you still haven't seen the rest of the house. I don't need to. It's perfect. I'm glad we'll have you here in town for a month. -You're a writer, right? -Yes. THE SEARCH ANTONIO PRIETO I'm no Neruda but I'll sign it anyway if you want. No, that's okay. -It's fine... -No. I... I checked it out from the library. Can I ask why you picked this town? Had you been? No. I saw the ad and called. I'm looking for solitude and silence. Then you'll love Quintanar. Solitude and silence are what we have most here. Justa will come tomorrow. The housekeeper you requested. You told her my hours? Yes, yes. She comes with my personal recommendation. So you have nothing to worry about. Then perfect. I won't lie to you either. She's my cousin. Anyway... See you later. Dog? Dog... Dog. Dog! Is somebody there? I feel bad but seeing him disgusts me. Keep your voice down, someone will hear you. What do I care? He's the one who needs to shut up. If he's howling something must have happened to him. If I have to go out there, I'll show him. Of course you're going. He probably came untied. Untied? I tied him up tight. -With the muzzle? -Of course. But the bastard rips it off. Take him some food. Check his water. -Maybe he saw a wolf and got scared. -A wolf? -What nonsense is that? -Just go and calm him down. And don't you dare touch him. Okay, okay, I'm going. Will you shut up already? Stop making a huge scene! Stop shouting! Stop shouting! Stop making a scene, damn it! Come here! Come here, if I have to go in there for you... I'll bash your head in! You got that? No food for a week, you hear me? There, there. Here, eat it. Eat it. Garbanzos with spinach. Eat it all. I'll rewrite it, give you what you want and everybody's happy. Okay, fine, but don't be angry. No, I'm not angry. You're too proud, Antonio. It's not good for us. Want me to say something I think too? Sure, go ahead. -Are you sure? -Positive. Look, I think you can't tell the difference between a good and a bad text because your only talent in life is being the son of the founding publisher. We'll find someone renowned. -Someone renowned? -Yeah. -Me? -Yes, you. I think you forget sometimes who you're talking to. As an artist I have a right to have a breakdown! Antonio... Damn. What are you looking at? Good morning, Antonio. Look, this is Justa, my cousin. Good morning. You remember she was coming today... Yes, yes. Did you sleep well? City folks usually appreciate rest in the country. Yeah, except the wolves howling, everything perfect. Right, sorry. I forgot to tell you. The mountain has wolves, but they almost never come down into town. The wolves protect us! Oh, yeah? From what? Town superstitions, pay no attention. I got lost in the forest last night for a moment and I found the shed. And I saw they have locked up... something they were feeding. Something? Something or someone, I don't know. It made very weird sounds. It was all very strange, like it was an animal. I don't know which shed you're talking about or which animal. Really. Oh, look. These are Justa's daughters, Soledad and Rosita. We've met, haven't we? -You're the Vimero. Isn't he, Sole? -Yes, he is. What did I say before? Not to speak to the gentleman. Let's go! He said he found a dog. And where is it, smart guy? He probably made it up. He's outside somewhere. Yeah, sure. What a liar. He's the Vimero. I told you. Pay no attention to the girls. They've read a lot of fairy tales and have a lot of imagination. Or they wouldn't be girls. And don't get the wrong impression of Justa. She's nice, she's just... Don't worry, it's fine. Okay. Anyway... I just hope you like the house. If you need anything, let me know. -See you later. -Goodbye. Can we keep them? It was in a closet. Smells like ass and wet rags. Ask Berta. Go on, don't bother me. Find one about wolves. Are you going to read all this? Maybe. Go on, get out of here! He's definitely the Vimero. What's the Vimero? What is it? Help! Help me! Help me! I need help! Save me! -No! Help! -Die! Die! Help! -Help! -Die! Help me! -No! -Die! Die! Die! Help me! I need help! Help! Help! Die! No! Help! "The screams of the forest inhabitant were inhuman. Curiosity took over the visitor and while going back to the shed wasn't the most sensible idea, he knew that caution's passport never gets you as far as bravery's safe-conduct." Get back. Don't eat until I leave. There you go. Excuse me. What's in there? Would you please answer me? What do you care? What is it? Go away. This is private property. You can't be here. Leave! Go! You're the visitor, aren't you? How do you know? Because you smell like the city. What'll it be? Good evening. What's typical? What's typical is to introduce yourself when you walk in the door. My name is Antonio, I rented the house on Mantec贸n Street. Mantec贸n isn't a street! It's a road. Welcome to Quintanar. Romero! Give him a drink on my tab. Thank you. Do you know who the Vimero is? If you're staying for a while, sit at any table you want. Carmen, bring out some garbanzos. I'm not hungry. Yes, you are. This goes right down. It's good. Glad you like it. What is in that shed? -It sounds like... -What? Like an animal? Esteban. This guy met Esteban! Esteban... is a normal man? He's a wretched man, but he's harmless. Especially because he's tied up! That's none of your concern. His mother's tied him up since he was little. After she found him eating a cow's heart. And the best part, it was his favorite cow! That's enough! My wife and I bring him food every day and we look after him. But if he's sick shouldn't he be somewhere they can treat him? Esteban is a part of this town and he'll die in this town like everybody else. We're all children of the curse. What curse? Did you come here for the festival? I only just found out there was one. What curse? Midsummer Eve. Yeah, they're already preparing the bonfires. In this town we burn bad omens and we make good wishes. Gentlemen, it's late! We're closing! Watch yourself. Hello? All this mystery is too much for me. Does somebody out there want to say something? Shit! Are you all right? I'm very sorry. Yeah, don't worry. I'm Father Benito. Nice to meet you. Antonio. Yes, Antonio Prieto, the writer. -Yes. -I heard you were in town and I came to welcome you. But I didn't expect to see you come running out of the forest like a madman. What happened? I heard a roar and got scared, I thought someone was following me. Probably a wolf. Are there really wolves here? If you see them and hear them, they must exist, right? That's true. I don't understand why the animals don't all team up and go down to the cities to eat all the people. I'm joking, don't be frightened. I wish that upon no one, I would never ask God to give a beast a rebellious, communist conscience. Have you got any mezcal? I don't even know what that is, son. This is an exquisite Mexican liquor. I tried it years ago and now we're inseparable. Try it, Father. Have no fear. Let's see. Want to try this? No, thank you, son. I've had dinner. Justa made it. You might know her. -My housekeeper. -Justa, yes. I know who she is. A woman of few words. Few words is saying a lot. I would say more like almost not a single word. -You were saying? -Yes. I was saying that this house has been empty for over 30 years. Although the town hall only put it up for rent very recently. Actually I think the town hall let you rent it because it had no owner. I suppose they didn't want to rent it sooner out of fear a relative might claim it. I understand. I believe it, some people have so many possessions... -they don't know what to do with them. -Right. Between monarchs, nobles and masons, they've split up all of Spain between them. And the Holy Church, Father. Oh, right. And who runs Quintanar? Any influential families? Military? Bastard landowner with lord's right to the first night... Quintanar is run by curses and superstitions. What does that mean? That. The people here are good and noble but also very easily frightened. They're definitely weird. I don't know if it's the climate, the wind... or the superstitions, but they're very peculiar. What's this about the Vimero? The Vimero? A legend that wouldn't surprise me at all if it concealed a true story about bestiality. Bestiality? Absolutely. That , but with animals. But what exactly is the Vimero. Like the local boogeyman? I understand that the last tenants of this house were very cultured and well-read. Apparently, yes. There's a huge library. With all those books, surely you'll find one about the legend of the Vimero. Understood. In Quintanar even the priests are superstitious. That would make a great line for the cover of your book. Antonio, do you like fishing? I don't know, I've never gone. It's the art we understand the best through prayer. -You know the dam? -I think so. I go fishing many mornings on the other side of the dam. Come by one morning. You can tell me if you've seen that Berta woman again. A woman like that deserves anyone's attention. Don't look at me like that. God knows I offered Him my celibacy, but He's the one who gave me these eyes. He didn't even tell me how to spell Vimero. "He ran across the forest as fast as he could surrounded by the endless howling and excited by the rusty flavor the blood had left on his gums." Good morning, Antonio. Can we talk for a little while? Sure, come in. How about we go for a walk, do you think? I don't know if you've heard, but... last night a wolf went into town and killed a bunch of sheep. So people are a little nervous today. I thought the wolves never went into town. Yeah, right. I don't know what could have happened. Did you know Quintanar was the last town in all of Spain to appear in the National Town Registry? It doesn't even show up on most maps in the registry. That's why I asked you how you had found it, because people say we're like a ghost town that doesn't even exist. That's what you needed to tell me? Well, that and... that I lied when I said I didn't know about the man in the shed. Esteban? You already know? I've heard, yeah. Well, Esteban... They locked him up because apparently, as a boy, he was very violent. He liked to kill animals and rip out their guts. So he's been locked up a long time? I'm afraid so. The innkeeper is his cousin so they let him stay in the shed. It's a disgrace to keep a man locked up like that. -But nobody will do anything. -Why? They're beliefs and rumors... The Vimero? The Vimero, yes. I have to go. Coming to the party tonight? I don't think so, I'm not much for parties. It would be nice if you saw the town on its night of magic. It depends how my writing goes. I'll be there. What's your problem now? Benito! Antonio, son. Benito, how are you? If you don't mind, I prefer you call me Father. Of course. Excuse me. I didn't think you would come. I went for a walk with Berta. She told me to go to the party tonight. I don't feel very comfortable in those environments. Think of it as a reward for getting far enough in your novel today. That's exactly what I said to her. Okay. Let's see. Grab one of these and stick it all the way -through the bait. -Father. I'm sorry, it kind of grosses me out. Take this one. You must be one of those people who sees a needle or a drop of blood and starts getting nervous. Pretty much. Let's see, come here. Dog! Come and meet the father! Let's see if your dog is an atheist. How's the writing going? Have you found inspiration in Quintanar? It's a long story. What's wrong? Since I got to Quintanar strange things have been happening. What do you mean by strange things? I hear voices, I see shadows, I find things in places where I didn't leave them. I think you're worrying too much about it. Relax. If what you need is for someone to tell you to go after that woman, I can do that. So what are you waiting for? Drop that rod, roll up your sleeves and go and find... What was her name again? Marta? Berta. Berta, that's right! Marta was my mother's name. Go and find Berta. And come and visit me at the chapel. It's there for you anytime. The chapel is your home for anything you need. Got it? Anything you need. "People say we're like a ghost town, that Quintanar doesn't exist." See you tomorrow! Justa! You don't have to come tomorrow. Tonight is Midsummer Eve, take the day off. Whatever you say. You don't want a ride home? -It will be night soon. -No, thank you. Watch out for the wolves! They can watch out for me! "WATCH OUT FOR THE WOLVES!" "THEY CAN WATCH OUT FOR ME!" Hello? Is somebody there? Girls? Good evening, sir. Eyes straight. And what you have inside too. God, from mud, every man did mold. Some for urinals, some for pots of gold. Look at all this great candy! Tasty and homemade! Delicious, look. An olive branch. An olive branch, sir? Good choice. It's the Virgin of Miracles. She protects from the beasts on the mountain, witches and all the monsters that can appear. I didn't imagine you were so superstitious. I'm not, it's just here... It's hard not to fall into something so primitive. They say that for it to work, you have to give it to someone. So let me. Thank you. -Happy Midsummer Eve. -Likewise, lovebirds. For someone like you, I mean, city folk... all this must be very strange. -Strange, yes. -Right. Not primitive. It's weird but you get used to it. Hello. -Would you like some? -No, thank you. No, no, no. Quintanar is special. And tonight, even more. Try them with herb liqueur. It's delicious! -Good evening. -Good evening. Give us two, please. Here, your candle. Thank you. I think I could get used to this. To parties. But this place isn't always a party. -Two more, please. -Yes. -Let's see. -To... Mom, come and dance! Come and dance. -No, no. -Yes, come on. No, no. I prefer the bar. Okay, your loss. Drink. Drink. The writer! -Drink! -Drink! -Drink! -Drink! Can we go now? What are you running from, Antonio? I'm not running, I just want peace and quiet. Yeah, right. Quiet, silence, solitude, that's what you want. I know. But in my language that means to escape. And men always end up running away. Not all men are the same. I don't know... Tell me what you know about the Vimero. Only if you promise not to put it in your book. I promise. The legend says the Vimero is a monster that brings death to the town. Every however many years, on Midsummer Eve, it's reincarnated in an animal or a person. And it goes into town to kill all the women it can. They say that many years ago several families in town managed to chase out the monster. So the Vimero placed a curse on those families and said that from then on all of their descendants would be born with physical deformities. That's why you've probably noticed that here in Quintanar there are... plenty of people with faults. Like Esteban? Esteban or anyone else in town with a deformity are called children of the curse. And that's exactly what we're celebrating tonight. On one hand, we feel respect for the brave family who chased away the monster, but on the other hand, we're afraid. Afraid because it reminds us that the Vimero can come back. Do you believe in that? Well, sometimes even the biggest sceptics turn to myths to explain the unexplainable. Really? It's only a legend. They locked up Esteban because he's aggressive, and... it's possible the origin of all this is something more like a wolf attacking people in the past. Nowadays it doesn't happen. But before, it seemed to be frequent. ...on Midsummer Eve. We come to cast away evil... The moon, the moon shines. What's that? You were curious about the Vimero? They're leaving him bread, fruit and meat as an offering. Why? The Vimero can only be reincarnated on the Midsummer Eve. They think that if they feed him... he'll be satisfied and won't kill anyone. The Vimero will not come... ...on Midsummer Eve. We come to cast away evil... ...on Midsummer Eve. No, I'm sorry, I can't. Thanks for walking me back. I didn't imagine you living with your cousin. Well, it's a large family home and some days we don't even see each other. Besides, I like to help her with the girls. Thanks for tonight, Berta. Thank you. We made you a drawing. To show you the Vimero so you understand things better. Dummy! MYTHS AND RURAL LEGENDS THE VIMERO "Of unknown origin and an insatiable appetite, anytime the Vimero shows itself a massacre begins that will not end until it is cornered. When cornered and frightened on land, the Vimero seeks shelter in the water." The water. Water... Water. Antonio... Berta, are you okay? Something awful has happened. What happened? Soledad... She was killed. Sole was killed. What? I saw her last night at your house. They found her on the road to the river totally massacred. Who could do such a thing? Do you want to come in, water? I have to go, Justa needs me. I just came to tell you personally. -I have to go. -I'll go with you. No, you'd better not. The police are investigating what happened. I'm telling you because they'll want to talk to you. Of course. Should I go to headquarters? There is no headquarters in town. I suppose they'll know how to find you. Can I help you with something? They called us this morning to start with the ditch and gravestone. They're burying the little girl tomorrow. Are you a relative? Good afternoon. I'm Sergeant Marco Mauri with the police. Antonio, good afternoon. -Antonio Prieto, right? -Yes. I'd like to speak to you for a moment, if that's all right. I'm sure you've heard. This morning a neighbour found Soledad Rodr铆guez dismembered in a sandbank. Dismembered? I knew she was dead... Yes, opened her up like an animal, cracked her ribs, ripped out her... That's enough. Oh, sorry. Unfortunately we're too used to these kinds of things. The mother and sister haven't seen the state she was in, so we got lucky there. We've set up a temporary headquarters in the warehouse coming into town. I'm staying a few days to talk to everyone who knew the girl and you'll understand that you're a person of interest. What I'd like to ask you is not to go anywhere this next week and try to remember if at any time you saw Soledad with anyone, if she talked to you, if she said she'd met anyone, you know. -And call me if anything comes up. -All right. I don't have a phone, my house is on Mantec贸n Road. Thank you very much, Mr. Prieto. Oh, one last thing. If your house is out of town, please be careful with the wolves. You city folk think you're invincible, but you're always the first to go down. Thanks. We're closing. I only want a couple of bottles of liquor. Bottles of what? I suppose you don't have mezcal. Local moonshine. Not playing dominoes today? No. Today we're talking about who could have killed Justa's little girl. You can't think of anyone? That's 500 pesetas. You know what? Given Esteban's violent record, who knows? Maybe he escaped from the shed, ran into little Sole... Hello. Sergeant Mauri? Mr. Mauri won't be here until tomorrow morning. And where can I find him? Right here, tomorrow morning. And where is he now? Investigating. Can you give me a phone number? Where he's staying? He goes to his hometown when he's done investigating. What time will he be here tomorrow? At eight. He'll definitely be here at eight. Very kind. At eight. Tomorrow at eight. I'm not afraid! Nothing that comes out of this forest will scare me! Nothing! "Nothing that comes out of this forest will scare me. Nothing." Has Sergeant Mauri arrived? He should be here soon. You can wait in his office if you want. The one who didn't want details. Excuse me. I couldn't have a job where I had to forget seeing these things. No, of course not. You'd rather write about them and let other people imagine them, right? Okay. What have you got for me? Remember anything? I have a suspect. Who? There's a shed in the forest. A family has locked up a dangerous hunchback named Esteban. Hunchback? Deformed, yes. Apparently with a violent past. He killed and gutted animals. Last night I went and saw he escaped. Take me to that shed. He's related to the innkeeper, he'll be able to help you. We missed a suspect. Have headquarters send officers and request civilian cooperation. We have to search for a man with physical deformities. I wanted to see how you were. My cousin is with some friends who came to be with her. Come in. She just fell asleep. I needed to see you. I'm sorry about everything you're going through. I think you should go. Esteban! You'd better come out! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Father? Father, are you here? Father. Antonio, son. Come in, sit down. I brought my dog, do you mind? All are welcome in the House of the Lord. Thank you, Father. Did you know Esteban escaped? Man is an irrational being without a soul who destroys and kills by instinct and people seek to justify his atrocities. You're a strange man, Father. You don't sound like a priest today. Perhaps because the wounded man inside me today occupies more space in my interior than the religious one. What worries you, son? I know you well enough to know something is wrong. When I sleep I don't sleep. I have nightmares but actually I think it's always the same one. What's it about? Someone running through the woods... Being chased, he's terrified... It could be me. Or me chasing him, I don't know. Try to insert yourself into the therapy. Continue. How does the dream end? The man being chased reaches my house, he stops, but he doesn't come in. Do you want him to? I don't know, maybe. Then ask him. Tell him: "I want you to come in." -Tell who? -Whoever is in your dreams. Yourself. God. The subconscious. Mother Earth. Your dead. Down deep, they're all the same. And what do I say? That if he's trying to tell you something, to be more clear. Because you want to know what it is, but you're not understanding. Maybe that way he'll show you. Things are easier than we think, son. You just have to know how to ask the right questions. And how to ask for what you need. Look how well things went with the woman from the other day. How do you know that? You can tell with those things. You still haven't told me your dog's name. He doesn't have a name. Things only exist if we give them a name, son. So if you're going to keep him, you should give him a name. I'm in no shape mentally to think about a dog's name right now, Father. "I will send four kinds of destroyers against them, the sword to kill, the dogs to rip them apart, and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy." What is that? Jeremiah 15:3. Jeremiah? Do you like Jeremiah? Coming to look for that wretch? I've done my part. Now I have to write. Then go. Write. There's a gun here waiting for you to destroy that monster anytime. Thank you, Father. Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Where are you? Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban, come out already! Esteban! Esteban! Esteban! "Knowing the dogs would find him, the hunchback rubbed animal feces on his body to throw off the scent. He stayed completely still inside the foxhole for several hours and waited until all of the search parties had passed... to go back to town." Who is there? Is that you, son? Esteban. Is it true what those gentlemen are saying you did? Answer me! How many times have I told you not to leave the shed? Nobody wants you out there. Yes, and they blame you for everything! And now look! Look what you've done! Stop behaving like a little boy! And listen to what you're told! Calm down. It's okay, come here. It's okay. It's okay. Esteban's mother! Let's go! Don't move! "Bullets, cartridges and pellets sink into his hunchbacked body. They dig into his tough skin and take his life." He's not dead, he's asleep. Damn! -We thought you might be dead. -Little girl, careful, there's a broken glass and you might cut yourself. My mother already cleaned it up. This is yours. Don't bother the gentleman. Good morning, Justa. Good morning, don Antonio. I didn't think you'd be back so soon. Anyway, a one-month contract means one month of work. I'm very sorry about your daughter. Do you mind me bringing Rosita? No, not at all. Here's a glass of water and an aspirin. Thank you. And you! Leave the gentleman alone! You're not telling things right here. Put that down. You're writing a book about the town and it's all lies! It's called fiction! Didn't your mother teach you it's rude to read people's things? It's the only way to find out -what really happened! -Oh, yeah? And what really happened? That fool didn't kill my sister and you know it! Out. It was the Vimero and a child of the curse can't be the Vimero. Whatever you say. Go play with the dog outside and leave me alone. -What dog? -Out! Goddamn it. Goddamn it! Carmelo. That's enough already! Hello, Jeremiah! A dead dog can't bite anymore. I hope this was the end. Let's hope. But you never know, Mr. Prieto, you never know. Anyway, good luck with the writing. And careful with the wolves. "A dead dog can't bite anymore." No. I ended up naming him Jeremiah. -Who? -The dog. What dog? My dog. I don't know what you're talking about, Antonio. You didn't just see a dog at the door? -No. -Are you joking? I swear on my life, I didn't see anything. Swear you didn't just see a dog at the door. Here. -Where I am now. Swear it. -Are you okay? Shh, shut up. Do you hear it? -You're scaring me. -Do you hear it or not, damn it! It's not such a hard question! No, I don't hear it! Do you hear it or not? He's screaming at the top of his lungs! What is this? "A man kills his wife and two daughters in the town of Quintanar." "The suspect, of Latin American origin... ...with the initials B.P. stabbed his wife to death in front of his son and then committed suicide by jumping into the river." "The boy, Antonio Prieto, has been taken to an orphanage in Madrid in hopes he might overcome the trauma he experienced after having witnessed his mother's murder." What's going on here? Take it easy, Antonio. Take it easy. What's going on here? What's going on here? What's happening? No, no, no... Berta. .. Antonio. What's wrong? Are you all right? I'm Father Benito. Nice to meet you. You still haven't told me your dog's name. Do you like Jeremiah? He ran across the forest as fast as he could, excited by the rusty flavor the blood had left on his gums. If you don't mind, I prefer you call me Father. Did you know Esteban escaped? I also know in town they're saying it's because of the curse. Man is an irrational being without a soul who destroys and kills by instinct. The chapel is your home for anything you need. Got it? Anything you need. I knew it! You're the Vimero! You killed my sister! Rosita, listen... You killed my sister! Murderer! Antonio's the murderer, Mom! He's the Vimero, he lied to everyone! Mom, Mom! The writer is the murd...! Do you think it's normal leaving in the middle of the night? Haven't we had enough? But Mom... And what's that nonsense about Mr. Prieto being a murderer? Now you know more than the police! You think I'm not grieving and want to blame anyone too? Go to your room right now. I saw it. What did you see? Let me tell you. Berta! Berta! Dad. -Justa. -I told you, Mom. Go to town and tell everyone. Tell them the Vimero is back and it's inside the writer. -Justa, I can explain. -Hurry! I can explain. Mom, Mom! Go, go! Listen to me! I'll chop your head off if I have to! I only said to listen to me. Rosita! Rosita! Rosita! Rosita! Rosita! Rosita! Death to the Vimero! No, no, no! Hey. You okay? I'm great. Where's my mezcal? No mezcal left in the whole hotel. You finished off the last bottle this morning. The press conference is in half an hour. I want my mezcal. Half an hour, Antonio. Mezcal. Half an hour. Awards. Awards mean absolutely nothing to me. All I want is the recognition of my readers, nothing more. Antonio, we've all been asking the same question for years: When is your next novel coming out? And you've always said that when you felt it, you'd give it shape. Why now? And why "The Snail's House"? Look, the legend says that the Vimero never dies, but it appears certain years with its insatiable appetite and goes on a rampage. Considering the fact that I write a novel every ten years, you might say I'm sort of a Vimero of this country's literature. I only write when I'm hungry. Antonio, how much is fiction and how much is reality in "The Snail's House"? Look, for the sake of everyone here, let's say fiction, because otherwise I should be in jail. Can you give us a preview of your next project or will you keep us waiting another ten years? Sandra, we really appreciate you asking him that question because we his publishers have been promoting with Antonio for days and we still hadn't dared to. Look, I'll be completely honest. "The Snail's House" reconciled me with my craft, so I promise not to go ten years without publishing a novel. Besides, I recently heard about the legend of the red shark of Barbate. It's a coastal town. Who knows? Maybe... I'll rent a house for a few days... and see if the monster appears. If you're looking at us because it's up to us... we'll send you tomorrow. Hi. Hi. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
