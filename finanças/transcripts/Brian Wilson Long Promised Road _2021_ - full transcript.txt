May I have... I'm sure most everybody knows, but for anybody who might not, may we introduce you by name? - Al Jardine - Thank you, Al. - Dennis Wilson. - Thank you. - Brian Wilson. - Carl Wilson. Mike Love. Now, I think, uh... whoop, what happened? There you are. How long has this singing been going on? About three years now. You know, it's an amazing thing, because you have hit after hit. Who determines, Brian, what will be done next? Well, I guess I do, I don't know. I write the songs and produce them, so I have a lot to say about it. - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh... - I think it's beautiful. This is a little intro, you know. All right, let's try to really pull it off good now. Here we go. Play hard and strong, all the way. You know the part... - Do-do, do-do... - Yeah, after the horn. That's your spot... do-do, do-do. And then what after that, Brian? Then he goes... ♪ Da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da Boom! Two, three, four... - Let me hear the organ. - Ba-dum! Perfect. Okay, we'll go with that. Let's go again, please. ♪ I know myself, I know my real power ♪ ♪ Will get me through again ♪ ♪ Ah... ♪ - Here we go. - Yeah. ♪ If you stick with it, baby ♪ - ♪ Ah... - ♪ Things work out ♪ ♪ You find a way to win ♪ You've been out on this really long tour. - Right. - You know, recording several new albums. Uh... you know, really nonstop since, you know, since your late '50s era. - Right, right. - Um... How do you explain that kind of burst of creativity and energy? Where does the, this, this sudden surge of creativity and energy come for you? It starts in my brain... makes its way out onto the piano... and then on to the... to the speakers in the studio. Yeah. Is that something you can explain? Is that something that's even explainable? No, I can't. I can't. And now, okay, I'd like to start it out with the, uh, organ and the Fender bass. He was one of the first people to actually use the studio as an instrument itself. Play hard and strong all the way. Really feel it, fellas, play. And there's a certain amount of songwriting you can learn how to do and you can educate yourself, and then... - Watch me on that part. - ...it's just a fact that some people are just better than other people... and Brian's one of the people who's just better than other people. Are we ready? Let's go. Take five, "Good Vibrations." ♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations... ♪ "Good Vibrations," goddamn. The idea that the chorus is at one studio and the verses are in the other studio? That's why that song is so freaky and so wonderful. "Good Vibrations" was recorded in four studios: Western, Sunset Sound, Gold Star and RCA Victor. Well, each studio was different, you know? Like, you can't... not any one studio's the same. - ♪ Excitations... - ♪ Closer... ♪ He sets a very high standard for... not just being innovative, but... to... also be emotionally evocative. ♪ When... ♪ I look in her eyes ♪ ♪ She goes with me to a blossom world ♪ ♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's givin' me excitations ♪ Well, he used all the orchestra.

It's a wonderful treat for me tonight to have heard and seen the Beach Boys... ...and as you can hear in the background, the girls are still hollering for them. I'm quite pleased to present to you two of them, Brian Wilson on my right, and Carl Wilson, his brother, on the left. So, this is just two of them. In just a minute, you'll meet the rest of them, but... Brian, I understand that you've written, uh, many of the songs that you all have recorded, and... when you write a song, um, for yourself or for your group... what gives you the, um, incentive to write them? Well, usually, uh, just the fact that we're in the industry and there's a lot of groups competing with us, and, uh, I feel that competition, you know, and also I just... I love music, and I get very inspired just generally creative anyway... - Right, I understand. - You know, and I just do it all the time, write all the time. Well, now, the, um... how many of them have you had that have been million-sellers? Well, actually, million-sellers, we've had one million-seller, that was "I Get Around," just recently. - You wrote this? - Yes, I did. ♪ Round, round, get around, I get around, yeah ♪ ♪ Get around, round, round, I get around ♪ ♪ I get around... ♪ ♪ Get around, round, round, I get around ♪ - ♪ From town to town... - ♪ Get around, round... Here's this genius who just can't help but come up with these complex arrangements of harmonies, and then his little brother comes in and says, "Well, you guys should write songs about cars and surfing, 'cause that's what kids are into." ♪ ...find a new place where the kids are hip ♪ ♪ My buddies and me are gettin' real well-known, yeah... ♪ Name some of them that you've written, Brian. Okay... Well, starting with, uh, "Surfin'," our first record, "Surfin' Safari," "409," "Surfer Girl," "Little Deuce Coupe," "Shutdown," "Surfin' U.S.A," "Be True to Your School..." "The Little Old Lady from Pasadena"? That's Jan and Dean. - Is that right? - And, uh... "Fun, Fun, Fun..." - Oh, it goes on and on. - "I Get Around," "Don't Worry, Baby..." we had "Little Saint Nick" - at Christmastime... - Uh-huh. - And then... pardon me? - "When I Grow Up..." - "When I Grow Up to Be a Man" and "She Knows Me Too Well" are our latest records. Well, you certainly are a talented young man. Let's talk to your brother just a minute. Do you share this, uh, admiration for your brother? Yes. Well... He's, he's done very well with us, you know, I mean... we've had great good luck with the records... And this... you're Carl, right? - Right. - Carl's the lead guitar player. Lead guitar. How did you, uh, assemble the group...? Well, one day, as we were walking down the street, we all bumped heads. - No, I don't know. - Seriously, Dennis got the idea that we should write something about surfing, because he was a big, avid server... surfer then. - You're a surfer. - Yes, ma'am. Well, this is something we don't have much out in Oklahoma. I, I know. Thanks so much for stopping by. May I compliment you on your beautiful dress? - Thank you. - It is beautiful. I think it is beautiful... is it a gown or a dress or...? Well, actually it's, uh... sort of, um, a beach girl type... - I like that. - I wanted to be in style when I talk to the Beach Boys. ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh... ♪ Get around, round, round, I get around... ♪ At the end of the concert, the girls would all rush the stage to get Dennis. You know, we'd say... me and Mike and the guys would go, "What's going on here," you know? The girls were all crying, "Dennis, Dennis," you know? - Yeah. He was our sex symbol. - Right, right. You and he had a little competition, uh, for some women sometimes, too, didn't you? - Who, me and Dennis? - Yeah. - No... - No? He was a ladies' man. I never was a ladies' man, you know? - Right. - He was always the ladies' man. What, what prevented you from being a ladies' man, do you think? Ah... just shy of girls, a little shy. Uh-huh, right. You can park right there. - In the handicapped? - Yeah. Yeah. - I always park there. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay. These guys'll probably wanna move it, but I'll park here. Okay. I'm hungry. - All right, let's get in there. - Okay. Must have been to this deli with you about... 20 times. - Yeah, at least 20. - Right? - Good times here. - Yeah. It's, uh... I'm, I'm hot, you know? - Yeah. - I'm nervous. - Yeah. - I didn't sleep last night, and my head feels wacky. - Oh, it does? - Yeah. Why don't we just relax? Okay. Enjoy our food. When you get scared, what do you do? You just take a deep breath? If I take... if I get scared, I take a, a deep breath, but I take it... try and take it from my belly. Oh, take it... - ...really deep in here... - Right. ...and then... How's your mood been? - My mood? - Yeah. - It's been about even... - Good. Good. Not depressed, not elated, just... - even. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - You feeling scared now? Little bit. It's nice to be with you. You're a good guy, Jason. Thank you, Brian. You are too. You are a cool person. You have a very consistent way of talking, you know? You sorta stay in this one space, you know? In talk. Does it make you feel comfortable? - Yeah, helps me out. - Good, I'm glad. When I'm scared, I listen to you talk, you know? - Really? - Yeah. And thinking... it'll calm you down? - Yeah! - All right, man. Well, I'm there for you. - I'm there for you too. - Thanks, man. I first met Brian in 1995. I went to interview him for the paper I was working for at the time, and we had a nice chat. And when I first came to work at Rolling Stone in 1997, Brian had begun to start what was gonna be sort of a solo career. He was putting a band together, he was releasing a record called "Imagination," and I... convinced... Jann, my boss, to let me go to Chicago, where he was rehearsing. One of the first times we spoke, uh, we were sitting in his living room. We were talking, and sort of right in the middle of our chat, about 10 minutes in, he just started to fidget, and he, he said, "I gotta go." And he got up and he left. And I was sitting there, I didn't know if he was coming back or, or not coming back, and I waited a while, and I just sorta started looking around, and I found myself in the kitchen, where I found Brian in the refrigerator. I said, uh, "What's going on?" He said, "I just got a little scared." And I said, "Well, what did you get scared of?" He said, "I don't know. You know, sometimes I just get scared, things scare me." I said, "Like what?" He said, um, "Like 'What a Fool Believes.' "You know that song by the Doobie Brothers? Scares the hell out of me." You know? And it was just like that. And we started having these moments, and ever since then, it just kinda became part of my beat at Rolling Stone to cover Brian. ♪ Wouldn't it be nice if we were older ♪ ♪ Then we wouldn't have to wait so long ♪ - ♪ And wouldn't it be nice... - And we became buddies. ♪ ...to live together ♪ In the kinda world where we belong... ♪ The idea of doing an interview makes Brian nervous, so he'll often ask if we can just take a drive and listen to some music. Look at that old car. What kinda car is that? - What is that? - I don't know. Is that a Rolls-Royce? Yeah, I think it's... don't think it's a Rolls. I think it's American, isn't it? Cadillac. - Cadillac? - Yeah. Old Cadillac, right? - Yeah. - From what, the '30s? Or maybe from the '40s? - Maybe '40s. - Yeah. Ask the guy, yell it out, ask him. - Well, I can't... - Hey, buddy?! What year is that car? - '41. - It's a '41. Thank you. '41. ♪ Let's go surfin' now, everybody's learnin' how ♪ ♪ Come on a safari... ♪ It was probably "Surfin' Safari," the first Beach Boys record I ever bought. The voices, the tone of the voices, was so beautiful. Bit like a classical choir, in a way. It made California sound such an incredible place to go. You know, the rooftop is down. The story begins. And then they invite you into that world, and that world has its own rules and its own code and its own story to tell. There was no greater world created in rock-and-roll than the Beach Boys.

Brian just threw away the rule book... and it was all in his head, and it's just, "Wow, are you kidding me?" "What were you thinking, man? "How did you come up with this combination of chords and voices?" He said, "I was at the piano, "and I was trying not to move "my highest fingers and my lowest fingers, but make cool geometric patterns with the internal fingers." I don't know if he was telling me the truth... ...but he definitely said that to me. But if you think about that, that's kinda like what Mozart does with a string quartet. Brian had this unique ability to write a great melody and also arrange some great harmonies and produce some great records, so we had all in one with Brian Wilson. We had a, a, uh, shall we call it a... a jackpot. Equate that blend, that harmony, the sound of the vocals... it's like looking up to the heavens. It's almost ethereal. There's a very ethereal, uh, rising up. ♪ I wish they all could be... The only way to really accomplish a sound that big is in knowing what you want to hear, but also placing some trust in the people you're working with and saying, "We can all do this together if you just follow my lead." ♪ I wish they all could be California... ♪ Brian was a leader, and he could shape this group around the brothers, you know, and his cousin and his neighbor, and that was his team, and he led these guys. And I think that that was... gave Brian so much confidence. They would do anything that he thought was the right thing to do. ♪ California girls... ♪ Hey, let's go... where you wanna go to now?

I don't know, I just wanted to have a sandbox. - While you worked? - Yeah. Took our shoes and socks off... and wrote, you know, music on a piano in the sandbox. I put an Arabian tent up in my den, and I put, like, eight Tiffany lamps in my... in the living room, hanging from the ceiling. It was a trip. It sounds like it. What did you do inside the tent? - Smoked grass. - Uh-huh. Ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. You know. Young and rich. ♪ I'm glad I went ♪ ♪ Now I'm much that more sure that we're ready... ♪ That's where I wrote, uh, the "Pet Sounds" album... - and "Good Vibrations." - Wow. That's, that's some pretty big stuff you wrote up here. Yeah. So, you think you'd wanna tour more? Yeah, I like to go on the road. What do you like about it? - Well, the concerts. - Yup. Makes you feel good? Yeah. It's fun to play a concert. Mm-hmm. You used to get nervous, but not so much anymore, huh? No... before a concert, I got very nervous. How long does it take you to calm down onstage? About two minutes. To this day, Brian's still even a little bit, a little bit nervous about "Pet Sounds," you know? "Are they gonna like it?" You know, "Is it too soft?" "Is it, is it manly?", he'll say sometimes. Hello, Los Angeles! The Hollywood Bowl. ♪ Where did... your long hair go? ♪ ♪ Where is that girl I used to know? ♪ ♪ How could you lose that happy glow? ♪ ♪ Oh, Caroline, you know... ♪ Well, you have the great "Caroline, No." It's one of the greatest songs in, in pop history, as far as dealing with oncoming adulthood, loss of innocence, reckoning with the adult world... and the terrible heartache that comes along with it. ♪ But that's not true ♪ ♪ Well, Caroline, you... ♪ I can hear him exploring the possibilities of these songs that he probably woke up, dug his feet in the sand, and wrote these songs. ♪ Could I ever find in you again ♪ ♪ Things that made me love you so much then... ♪ He rounded out writing happy songs and then, as he grew as a musician, his tastes refined, his writing refined, and he wanted to get away from the three-chord thing and experiment, and when you do that, you are drawn to the darker side... I know I am. Brian's music, you know, especially "Pet Sounds," you never move on from it. I'll be listening to that record till the day I die. "Pet Sounds," the beauty of it... carries with it a sense of... joyfulness even in the pain of living. The joyfulness of an emotional life. You have this music bed that is so complex, but the lyrics were very simple. All these concepts of things that we all ask ourselves, and it's there forever. 50 years later, we're still celebrating what is probably one of the greatest records ever made. Whoa! I don't even know what that is. Flutes in reverb? I don't know. ♪ ...without you... Whoa... ♪ God only knows what I'd be without you... ♪ ♪ God only knows what I'd be without you... ♪ ♪ Whoa, God only knows what I'd be without you... ♪ ♪ God only knows what I'd... - ♪ God only knows... - ♪ Bom bom bom... ♪ - ♪ What I'd be without you... - ♪ Whoo ooh... ♪ ♪ God only knows what I'd be... ♪ - ♪ God only knows... - ♪ Bom bom bom... ♪ - ♪ What I'd be without you - ♪ Whoo, ooh... ♪ - ♪ God only knows... - ♪ Bom bom bom... ♪ - ♪ What I'd be without you... - ♪ God only knows ♪ ♪ God only knows... ♪ I don't even know where to begin. Probably took a minute for everyone to wrap their heads around a 23-year-old kid coming in and telling 'em what was up. That's a banjo. It is a banjo, huh? Brian always had this thing where he used the fifth, uh, note of a chord as the bass note. "God Only Knows" is a prime example of that. ♪ I may not always... with the bass note. And "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" is exactly the same. So, you can, you can hear the other instruments. They're all in one room at the same time, playing. With Brian's music, you hear his spirit, and it's like... he may be playing a C chord, but there's, like, this other weird harmony drifting in over it. He's using the available tools that all of us have. You know, it may be a piano or a harpsichord or a guitar or whatever, but it's all in the architecture or the recording technique. So, everybody has a piano or a guitar. Go grab whatever the fuck you want, but it's like the way you put in the strangeness, that's what he's the master of. Listen to that basic track. Sounds to me like it's maybe a piano... and... a banjo... and a harmonica kinda all becoming one sound. Brian had to sit home, dream up these textures that no one had ever, ever used... uh... That's one reason why people say Brian's a genius. That's being a complete visionary, to dream up these textures that never existed before. I'm still awestruck by the construction. How he took very complex arrangements, and yet, at the end of the day, they sounded so simple when they, when they entered your ear. ♪ ...where I'd be without you... ♪ I think his imagination is what made him a great producer. We can all sit here and say we have all the technology and we know how to use it and we know how to do it, but the bottom line is it doesn't matter what you know, it's what's you're gonna do. - ♪ ...what I'd be without you - ♪ God only knows... ♪ I've been making records for... 40-some years, and I don't know how you do this. I don't know how you do that. Nobody knows...... how you do that. What I hear is his competitive nature, him wanting to be more than what everybody else was. And you can totally hear how he was trying to make things sound better than the Beatles. But I think, more so, his biggest competitor was himself. ♪ ...you... ♪ How was that, was that cool? - Yeah, it's beautiful. - All right. When he started doing the music around "Pet Sounds," which was... more complex, more orchestral, more personal... you know, the guys started saying, "Whoa now," you know? I mean, uh, "Where are we going with this?" You know, this isn't about cars and girls anymore. And things started to fragment. And I don't think it's any wonder that Brian started to lose his confidence around that time. When you think about recording or touring, do you feel like you still have something to accomplish musically? Do you still have things you want to get... you wanna do? Yeah, I might... wanna make a rock-and-roll album. Mm-hmm. Maybe something good, you know? Yeah. What's rock-and-roll to you? - Rock-and-roll? - Yeah. Chuck Berry... you know. - Little Richard. - Mm-hmm. Well, I recently watched - the "Smile" concert. - Yeah. Wow, you looked really happy that night. - Yeah, that was fun. - Was it hard to pull off? We, we premiered "Smile" and the "Lucky Old Sun" album 2004 and 2005. When you let it go, when you stopped working on it in '67, was that a hard thing for you? Yeah, it was rough, yeah. Me and Van Dyke got so into it, you know. We really got into it. When you premiered "Smile," how did you feel? I mean, it must have been a big relief. Well, it was, it was a big challenge to try - to pull it off, you know? - Right. But we did.

You guys think you're good? Can we hear a chord? Just a chord, like we used to. When you used to sing clear records, okay? Let's go. His presence was very... where he'd burst into a room, you know? And beat everyone up. I got beaten around by my dad. One kinda spanking is... But the way I had it, Dad would double over his belt. His voice... ...very, very hard. Pretty tough business. His dad was extremely tough on him... um, abusive at times. You can hear this in, in all the old tapes from those studio sessions, where his dad takes it way too far. We just wanna be sure this is our thing. This is an absolute insult. Well, you're doing the same to me in front of 20 people.

Is this the house where Elton came over? Yeah. Going to Brian Wilson's house with Danny Hutton of Three Dog Night was just the most amazing, surreal trip for me. Here we are, in Brian Wilson's house, who we used to lay on the floor and listen in our headphones to all his beautiful music. It was... one of the most moving nights of my life... and he tried to sell me his piano as well. But, um, to that time, he went through such a dark period of his life. So, Bellagio is kinda where... things got difficult for you, huh? - Yeah. - What was going on? Uh... I was just... kinda lonesome and, you know... hung out in my bedroom for a while. What were you staying in your bedroom for? I don't really know. I was having mental problems. Yeah. Yeah. And everyone always says, "Oh, you stayed in your bedroom for years." You didn't really do that. - No, for a couple of weeks. - Yeah. Sometimes you question yourself, and I think, especially when you grapple with demons, and you think, "Well, do I deserve this? Am I worthy of this?" And, you know, I think about Brian being saddled with... the term "genius" from such an early age. That's gotta weigh on you so much. ♪ Lost my way... ♪ I think about someone like Brian, and, and coming into this when he was becoming a man and really starting to make the music that would change the world in a lot of ways.

We used to fool around together. - Mm-hmm. - You know? - He was a, a good drummer. - Yeah, he was. You were really close friends with Dennis. Because we snorted cocaine together. He used to buy cocaine for me. Mm-hmm. You know what he used to do? He carried around a big, huge bottle, plastic bottle of grapefruit juice and vodka. Wow. And he would stay drunk the whole day. He was crazy. Crazy guy. You think that was 'cause he was anxious and nervous? Yeah, he, he's always been, like, a... little bit nervous person, you know? Mm-hmm.

Um, he kind of overstepped his, uh, boundaries or something, whatever boundaries there were supposed to be, and got involved in songwriting and production and stuff like that. That was kind of a real drag. When people realized how bad that was, I think that started the wheels turning pretty quickly to, to get rid of Landy.

It's amazing, that day, you did so much that day. It was your birthday party, you filmed that Rolling Stone cover, and you did that skit for Saturday Night Live, all on the same day. Let's go surfin' now. Everybody's learnin' how. Come on a safari with us. - Come on. - Let's go. Right. How does it make you feel to hear these songs? Oh, wonderful. What a great feel. Oh, I'm so proud of Carl, again, man. When did you first know that Carl could sing leads so well like that? Well... 19... 60... 5 or 6. When he sang "God Only Knows," you must have known, "My gosh, he's really stepped up." Well, I was gonna do the vocal, and I said, "Carl, do you wanna do the vocal?" He goes, "Sure, I'd love to," you know? So he did the vocal. And he killed it.

Someone's coming in too soon. ♪ I know that love is what I really wanna share ♪ I can remember almost word for word a quote that, uh, Brian Wilson, more than anybody else, has had a profound effect over American rock music for the next 30 years. You can hear it... your influence is everywhere, Brian. I mean, do you feel that's a strong responsibility? Yes, I do, sure, because, uh, once you've established yourself as... an artist, producer, somebody who has something to say, it's, it's an artist's obligation. It's constructive work, you know, it's work. Any artist that you find has that feeling. He feels the need to please, you know? And it's a very personal thing, and it's something that comes with... it's natural, you know? It's a natural thing. When I hear his music, it makes me smile.

It's like it finds you there and it takes you up out of it. That was just innately in the music. The harmonies, the sound of them, offered a way out, and offered a transcendence. You can put on all these songs, and it still stands up. We're never gonna have Brian Wilson ever again. He once told me that, uh, he used to pray to make really spiritual music and to make a better album than "Rubber Soul." - Good one. - That's a good prayer. It worked. That should convert you. Brian is a living example, through his suffering, through his pain, he found a joy. His music... is an act of love. - ♪ Long promised road - ♪ Bah-bah, bah-bah ♪ ♪ Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending ♪ ♪ Never ending ♪ Good one! I like it! Beautiful. ♪ Barbara Ann...
