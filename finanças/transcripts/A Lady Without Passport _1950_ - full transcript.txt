Ram?n. I've been looking all over New York for you, get in. You can't get away with that money Ram?n. Palinov wants to see you in Havana, get in. Get back, come on please get back. Stay back, everybody. Maniac. - He's crazy. - Stand back please. All right, stand back. Step back. Victim's name, Ramon Santez. He had a tattoo on his chest. Victim's address unknown, this stuff was found in his pockets. What good is half a thousand dollar bill to anybody? No good without the other half. - We really drew a blank on this guy. - Wait a minute. These are given away free on airlines and so are these. Looks like we better start checking flights, thanks Doc. All right. - Morning Miss. - Good morning. They tell me you recognized the man in this picture. Yes, I remember him. Flight 30, yesterday morning. - Yesterday morning? - Yes, nonstop to New York from Miami. Did you notice anything unusual about this man's behavior? Well, he was looking sort of greeny so I gave him the inhaler and some gum- - Any, anything else? - No. Miami, eh? All right. Thank you very much. - Bye. - Goodbye. Well, your man recently walked through a field of ripe sugarcane. We found traces of it in his shoes and the cuffs of his trousers. - Sugarcane not in New York. - Not in Miami either. This red clay we found on his shoes is typical of Cuba. Miami and Cuba? Well, it's a job for the immigration boys. Passengers from flight 26 from Miami now arriving at gate 5. - Lieutenant Lannahan? - Yeah. - I'm Chief Control Inspector Westlake. - Hi. Got something for me? That I have, a picture of a dead man, a half-thousand dollar bill... some chewing gum, an inhaler and a lot of questions. It's quite a haul, come on. We will prepare a dossier on Santez for you but you will find only one item of interest. Since I'm starting from scratch one would be a help. Santez was associated with a man named Palinov, owner of the Gulf Stream Cafe. Our information on Se?or Palinov's activities will be included in the dossier. - Thank you. - In appearance, this Palinov is... Se?or, he is charming. He is refined, considerate. However, I'm certain he's not so considerate toward the laws of the United States. Particularly those relating to the smuggling in of aliens? Pues, s?. 5 or 6 aliens make an appearance at his cafe every week or two. They are to be found sipping drinks at a table. Then suddenly, poof, they disappear. And the next week, a new group. Well, that's for me. I'll try to do as much for you sometime Lieutenant. That we will offer any assistance goes without saying. I regret we are unable to arrest him for you but we, like you, we have no laws... preventing aliens being taken out of the country. - I understand, thank you very much. - A su orden. Se?or, a word of caution. Palinov is also arrogant and clever. He has spotted every man we've assigned to his cafe. I don't intend to walk in and wait for him to spot me, I want an invitation. I'm going to let se?or Palinov come after me. Carla. We talk americano just like all us Americans. Oh, this makes 5 since noon. Today, nobody will be refused. Marianne Lorress. Here you can see everything... they come in their finery, trying to cling to their dignity... trying to hide the desperation they feel. You will not keep me out of the United States. We're not here to keep you out, we're glad to admit you if you're eligible. - I am eligible. - Just fill in those forms. Your new application will be dated as of today. Application? How long I have to wait this time? - Hungarian quota? About 3 years. - 3 years? I don't wait 3 years. Let them wait 3 years, not me. The spell is broken, now nobody will be admitted today. Oh monsieur, excuse me. I too have just come from the embassy. - So? - So many so foolish laws. - So many facets. - I overheard upstairs. - I view your problems with great sympathy. - Save your sympathy. Oh, well. Oh, allow me monsieur. Would you do me the honor of having a drink with me? You pay? I drink. You will like what's offered here. The usual. Yes, I know how a man like yourself must resent those idiotic regulations of the US. I resent them? I spit on them. - Who are you? - I am Palinov. And this is my humble home, my business, my hobby. I don't think much of it. I am Joseph Gombush, eg?szs?gedre. - Hungarian? - Formerly. - Hol sz?lette? - Budapesten. Ah. ?n ismerem Budapestet. - Milyen utc?ban? - R?koczi ?t 7. - Are you too a Hungarian? - Ah, only when the occasion demands. - I'm a levantine. - Oh? I was brought to your establishment by... - He was going to pay. - On the house. Eg?szs?gedre. I could hardly ask a new friend to wash glasses to pay for his drink. - You are insulting. - Oh, I was joking, put it away. I heard you speak of the laws governing immigration into the United States. - You overheard. - One overhears more interesting things. - I will have another of the same. - On the house. You were saying. One would think I had enough to do running the Gulf Stream cafe, but no. - I had to be plagued with a soft heart. - It's hardly noticeable. When I hear of people who want to enter the United States, I am moved. - And what do you do? - What can I do? Occasionally, I put someone in touch with a man who might help him. - I would pay. - I wouldn't dream of it. Any price, within reason for you or anybody else. Wait. Miss Lorress. I understand the embassy couldn't help you. - Will you help me? - How anxious are you to go? Very or I wouldn't have come back. I try not to get sentimental, I run a business. The fee for my services is 1,000 dollars, payable in advance. - I haven't the money. - As I say, I try not to get sentimental. - But sometimes... - if I had 1,000 dollars... you wouldn't expect all of it here. It would be torn in half to ensure good faith? Good faith on both sides. You said you'd take me to Charleston, South Carolina. When I get there, I may be able to pay you. Trusting a woman as beautiful as yourself is very sentimental. How can I be sure of you in Charleston? Good faith. In view of the circumstances the arrangements will take less time than I anticipated. Nothing is changed, the same in Havana as it is in Paris or Vienna. Allow me. If you'll be good enough to wait. - Santez? - Dead. - Hit by a taxi. - I couldn't get the half bill. - The police, I tried, but... - But we may be visited. New York cops, how they going to figure a Havana connection? Don't underestimate, we all leave tracks to our past. - Not me. - Questions might be asked. Would I have to tell the truth when I answered? Again, you underestimate. A shrewd man never asks questions... until he is gathered enough information to be able to distinguish between lies and truth. There's a Mr. Gombush in the cafe. There is no reason to assume that he is anything more than he claims to be. I think, however, something more than a routine check is indicated. This place is like a morgue. I am Joseph Gombush. Before this gloom descends upon my soul too I offer to buy everyone a drink personally. At least to enliven the atmosphere and to loosen tongues in intelligent conversation. No, thank you se?or. I withdraw my offer. Another glass, gloomy one. In it is the best company to be found in this place. I never inquired, you're not by chance, Hungarian? - Viennese. - No matter. As a favor to me, don't be surprised at anything I say. Gombush. Mr. Joseph Gombush, Miss Marianne Lorress. I thought, since you were both Hungarians in Havana, you might be lonesome. You are Hungarian? My dear friend, you mean to say you didn't recognize the name? - Lorress? - Mayor of Budapest. One of the most famous men in all Hungary. Oh, that Lorress. Of course, if not the most famous, at least the most infamous. - What a charming scoundrel he was. - Miss Lorress here is his niece. The rumors around Budapest about him and the parties. Nowhere have there been such banquets, such orgies of the gourmet. Do you remember the story about the visiting princess? - I can't say that I do. - This you must hear. You will forgive me Miss Lorress, this I must tell se?or Palinov in private. I waste my time telling a smart man like yourself but never trust a beautiful woman. - I trust everyone. - As you wish, but she lied to you. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure., there was never a mayor Lorress in Budapest. Good day Miss Lorress. He says that you deliberately knocked down his fruit, is that right? Nothing of the sort. The man is insane, he's a fool. Stupid fool. The gentleman was not familiar with the Cuban laws, he will pay you for the damage. I don't sell nothing but the best fruit se?or. - All of it is ruined. - Will this take care of it? An expensive method se?or, to get rid of a pursuer. Well, I didn't think it was a good idea for him to see me walk into the police station... or to know that I was trying to shake him. I made a good contact with Palinov but I can't count on that alone. Pues no, you people have an expression. - A cat can be skinned 9 different ways. - That's right, But I've got to have a lead to this bunch of immigrants he's going to smuggle in. That thought, it occurred to us too. They might have objected to having their pictures taken. You may wish to send these on to the United States se?or. It will make identification easier should they enter your country. You've been a great help Lieutenant. I think I've got myself a lead. - Good evening. - Good evening. Is Miss Lorress in? If she is, she must've squeezed through the keyhole. But I wish to see her. Maybe if she had distinguished callers like you, she wouldn't have been locked out. - You see, no money, no room. - You know where she went? I'd try the street of the cafes. Go fast, go fast, a beautiful girl don't remain on her own very long in Havana. - For me? - For you. Oh, merci beaucoup, Ce, c'est tr?s gentil. Mister, I'm a guide. You want a guide? You need a guide here in Havana, eh? Anyplace you want to go. I can show you all the places in Havana. You can't walk around without a guide in this town. You know, I can show you. No matter where you want to go, I can show you anyplace. Anyplace you want to go. - Mister, let me show you. - Some other time, some other time. - Take your hands off the se?orita. - She's under arrest. Yes, only the police has the right to paw me. She's in my costume, it is mine. She must remove it. You'll appear tomorrow on charges. Come along. - Se?orita, my costume, take it off. - What? Here, right now, in the street? When you are charged tomorrow you'll get back the costume. - Marianne, what foolishness is this? - You'll step aside please. Police, I will take care of this. It would serve you right if I were to step aside. Lucky for you I have a forgiving nature. Come, I will take you home. - Well, the police may object. - Why? I've said I forgive you. The se?orita, an alien took employment in Cuba without a work permit. According to the statutes, this offense is punishable by arrest and deportation. This is ridiculous. I, Joseph Gombush, say so. You are a man of the world. The lady and I quarreled. She sometimes thinks I don't know what is best for her, she has a temper. So you were going to prove that you could get along without me. My friend, what is one to do with a stubborn woman? This girl, whom I love so dearly, we forever have lovers' quarrels. There is nothing... I can do nothing for you. I am totally acquainted with the laws of my own country. There is not so much difference, I say, the girl is innocent. - That is for the judge to say, come with me. - She did not take employment., This means to work, to work is to be paid, were you paid? - No. - No. I should pay to get myself charged as a criminal? Quiet. Do you know that this was not lark, dressing in costume, pretending to be cigarette girl? True, every word of it. I swear she has never worked, it was only joke. - According to the statutes... - The girl is not a criminal. No harm has been done. Discuss the matter with your chief. You may quote me, Joseph Gombush. He will agree. If not, you know where to find her. - These facts on your papers are accurate? - Oh yes. - You can be reached at this address? - I'm no longer... Just today, a change. She is at my hotel, the Vicente. Next time, perhaps you will listen to me, look at yourself. I'm ashamed to be seen with you. Se?orita, se?orita... - Se?orita, my costume. - Be thankful you're not in jail. In jail? - Hotel Vicente. - S?, se?or. The Vicente. According to police records this is where I'll be living. Gracias se?or, muchismas gracias. Your hotel? You would not have liked the jail, I understand it's rather overcrowded. Hotel rooms too, may become overcrowded. Miss Lorress, one may leave a hotel room whenever one wishes... but in jail, I believe there are certain formalities. A room for Miss Lorress. Yes se?or, yes, of course. S?, se?or. - 214. - Never mind, I know where it is. Get some wine right away. - S? se?or. - Next to your own. This girl could sell me cigarettes and I don't smoke. I smoke. - Thank you Mr. Gombush. - May I? You're no longer ashamed to be seen with me? Only in public. I think it's only fair to warn you Mr. Gombush, you're quite right. - I am stubborn and I do have a temper. - Then I shall take care not to arouse it. - Ah, that little matter we quarreled about. - Oh? What was it? I seem to have forgotten. I believe it was your refusal to kiss me good night. We could quarrel again. As I told the policeman, the lady doesn't always know what is best for her. He was very understanding. No policeman is understanding. For 10 years they've driven me and everyone like me across the world. You can't stay here, We've laws, get out. But where, where can I go? Now I'm in Cuba, I may stay but... I can't work, the law says don't earn your living or you will be deported. Find your bread on the street. You live with anger. There are more pleasant companions. Another souvenir of the law, Buchenwald. Come in. The wine se?or. Sometimes even when it seems there is nothing to celebrate... one can find cause for mild rejoicing... the avoidance of arrest or perhaps... just getting rid of a man who is acted like an insensitive boor. Good night Miss Lorress. - Se?or I, it was a mistake. - Start talking. Please se?or, I will tell you. This room looks like any other room, I didn't know it. - This one is a hard head. - I have found nothing. A cop. Gombush, Gombush. - Police. - We had to do with the police before. This is just the first time a cop is moved in on a girl you want. - The girl had nothing to do with it. - She just likes the rooms at the Vicente. Other girls like them at the Gulf Stream cafe. Shut up. Never can tell what she's liable to whisper in that cop's ear some quiet night. The girl knows nothing, she can tell nothing. Just one way to be sure. If he is killed, will be replaced, perhaps by a smarter man... certainly someone we won't know. It's no trouble to keep an eye on him. - Yes, who's there? - Marianne Lorress. Come in. - Police? - Oh, I don't think so. Do you? You suspect me, don't you? Why don't you say what you think? Last night after bringing you to my hotel I had visitors for the first time. - A remarkable coincidence. - Oh? One encounters coincidence frequently. Who would guess that in Havana I would... meet the beautiful niece of mayor Lorress of Budapest? If there was a mayor Lorress in Budapest I know nothing about him. And I don't know why Palinov chose that introduction. As for the visitors I... Well, let's say the visitors were just thieves. I'm prepared to ignore the whole incident. I came here this morning to thank you for your kindness. Any gentleman would've provided a room for a lady in distress. But not every gentleman would've been so considerate, thank you. Wait. Havana can be lonely. - Surely you can find the company you want. - I have. I hoped I had too, I'm sorry we're both disappointed. You wouldn't want to knock on the door again? We could pretend you just arrived. I would open the door and be so pleased to see you. I'd bow, wish you good morning, invite you in. We'd go to breakfast together, spend the day. Goodbye Mr. Gombush. - Come in, good morning. - Buenos d?as. Havana looks different today, maybe it's because I'm seeing it with you. Surprised? You knew without my telling you, didn't you? A little kindness means a great deal to you. Kindness is been a stranger to me for a long time. But anyone who came along, right man or wrong, if he was gentle, considerate. Not anyone. Havana does look lovely. It's a way station, the last one, then the United States. Is it everything people dream about? I don't know, it is what many have dreamed. Others whose dreams have edges which are... too round, colors too bright, they're disappointed. Oh, I'm not looking for streets paved with gold. A home, respect, freedom and neighbors who want the same thing. Marianne, don't hope for too much. - I'm just beginning to hope. - Even if things go as you expect... I've been to the United States. A little thing like an accent, a foreign name can set you apart. - There's always someone who laughs. - Can't be bothered with things like that. Joseph, what is it? - You're going away, we will be separated. - - Oh, we'll go together. - Palinov will arrange it. - He hasn't yet. But if you have the money, there is no reason... You have no money, how will you go? - I'll go. - How? I'll make my arrangements. - I'll speak to Palinov about you. - No. No, I'll speak to Palinov myself. You are taking Miss Lorress to the United States, I demand to be taken also. It occurs to me that you are in no position to demand anything. Don't expect me to plead. I pay for what I get in cash. Go on. I must leave Havana and get to the United States. Have you tired of Havana so soon? Are its charms so ordinary that they may be easily cast aside? You, go on, why the hurried leave? Is there anyone you wouldn't care to face when the facts are known? When I go, I don't go alone... and I don't promise transportation is paid to assure me of companionship. - You use lies as bait. - A blackmailer should know all about lies. No better than a policeman. - It's out in the open. - Where the stench can reach any nostril. I got a personal interest in you Palinov, from now on you're for me. Don't let anyone else squash you underfoot, save yourself until I get ready. Se?or. Hello, Mr. Westlake, Pete Karczag. This thing is blowing up pretty fast, probably in my face. This guy knows who I am, also knows we can't touch him unless we get him in the States. We can't let this one blow up Pete. There's got to be a way to salvage it. What about the Lorress girl? I got the report you mailed. She ought to be a lead. Well, I wouldn't count too much on her, she... Yeah, but I don't... Well, maybe I'm not the right guy for this job anymore, replace me. Maybe I will, meanwhile you stay with that girl. Don't let her out of your sight and get the answers. Yes sir. - You saw Palinov? - You go, I don't go. Am I the reason he won't take you? - When do you leave? - Tomorrow. - At night, I think. - How will you go? Tell me when you find out, at least I'll be able to wave bon voyage. Joseph, you know what it means to me to go to America. Some are not so impatient, they wait to enter legally. I would enter legally if I could. I must go with Palinov or not at all. - No one has asked you to make excuses. - My father is in the United States. For 10 years we've waited. His fortunate daughter has her own ways of joining him. He can't help me to get in, he's an alien illegally in the United States. - I've never said that to anyone before. - No need to tell me. - I've a home waiting for me Joseph, a home. - I don't want to hear it. I've destroyed your chance to get to America, brought you nothing but unhappiness. Oh, people like us shouldn't have emotions, I don't know what we've done but... somehow we're robbed of the future. You just told me about your future, you have made a choice. Don't you understand? My father, a home, freedom, a dream I've had for 10 years. All this weighs the scales heavily on one side. What you want me to do? Whatever you wish. Joseph, if you'd ask me to stay that would outweigh everything. - Marianne... - Ask me to stay. Marianne, don't go. We'll find some way. I'll see you in a minute. Go away. - I like to watch you. - You better learn to do as you're told. In my family, the men give the commands and if they are not obey... What happens? Dear Marianne, each time I see you, look lovelier, more desirable. I've wonderful news, a change of plans. - We'll leave tonight, at once. - I've changed my mind, I'm not going. - No? - No. Gombush? He clutters up my life, because of him I must leave a day earlier. Because of him I must be deprived of your company. I would hate him if he were not a member of the United States immigration service. - You're lying. - Why you suppose he sought you out? - Why does he try to worm information? - Get out. You have only to ask Mr. Gombush, if that is his real name. Joseph, are you police? - Marianne, what... - Answer me. No, I'm not a policeman, I was going to tell... You deal in technicalities, you're an immigration inspector. Marianne, listen to me. I came to Havana to get Palinov, but when I met you, something happened. I told you the truth to... - Marianne... - Harry... Sit down. If this letter were mailed there be no search for you. I'll send Jos?, wait for him. Tomorrow mail the letter. Good night Mr. Gombush. Walk over there. Push your face through that wall. Drop it. You're going to talk. But se?or, I do not know what this is all about. - What is it se?or? - Get the police, Lieutenant Carcagno. Si se?or. - Where's Palinov? - I do not know. I swear by my mother se?or. - He goes tonight, that I know. - How? - As always, by airplane. - From where? I do not know se?or, they, they speak only of the airfield. I have never been there. - If I knew, se?or, believe me, I would... - I don't believe you. - What's the pilot's name? - I've heard them speak of a se?or James. That we check. Out, the other way. Hold it. Operator? Emergency, get me Mr. Westlake of the immigration service in Miami. Karczag, Pete Karczag, immigration. Mr. Westlake? Karczag sir. Palinov and the aliens are flying out of here sometime tonight. The pilot's name is James. Hold it Pete. Jack, that civil aeronautics folder. A licensed pilot named James. Right. Know anything about what kind of a job they fly? What kind of a plane is it? - What kind of a plane? - That it flies. - It flies. - Thanks. With that kind of a load it would've to be a twin engine job. Hang on Pete, we'll check on that pilot. Let's see. 1, 2, 3. Maximum range, full load. His home field will have to be right in our district. Here it is. Archer Delby James, based right here in Miami. Twin motor plane, scenic flights, flying lessons, private ferrying jobs. Out of the city about half the time. Plane number NC-54860. Get through to the south Miami airport, quick. Right. On the nose Pete. - A wrap-up if I ever saw one. - It better be a wrap-up. I'll be back tonight. You, come on. That's right, James. Plane number NC-54860. Right. Took off 4 hours ago, didn't file a flight plan. Yeah. No idea where he's going. Thanks., hold it a minute. He's in flight to Cuba for the pickup, time is like a dream. - He's our man, we want him. - Right. Take this guy, will you? And there's a dead man upstairs, the one who followed me. Adelante. - Palinov is flying out tonight. - Do you know where? Probably a private airfield somewhere, can we cover them? But there are dozens on the island se?or, maybe hundreds. It could be in a clearing or a strip through a sugarcane field. I can get you the plane number. Of what use if we don't know where to look? But I got to get them before they take off. Why not in the states se?or? There you get them on two charges, illegal entry... and smuggling, you get not only Palinov but the people he's smuggling in. Yeah, I thought of that too. - Want to have a look? - C?mo no? - Have I forgotten anything? Check me. - No sir. The minute that plane sets down anywhere from South Carolina to Texas, we got him. I figure they'll take off from Cuba in time to cross the United States coastline... - before daybreak. - An early morning landing in... Border Patrol, westlake speaking. This is East Savannah, Georgia, municipal airport. That airplane you're studying about... well, she's been standing right here on the field ever since 5:30 this afternoon. Sure, I'm sure. - NC-54860. - Hold it. I don't get this at all, instead of flying south to Cuba... James is flown north to Savannah, Georgia. - Well, maybe he's... - Any passengers? Oh, no sir, there were no passengers. James flew in alone and headed up to town like he always does. I expect he'll be hitting the spots for the next couple of days. Ok, thanks. We've fallen flat on our faces, James isn't our man. James my friend, good to see you again, how was the flight? Like all of them, flew the other plane to Savannah... left it on the field like a sitting duck then picked up this one. - Who's going to shepherd this flock? - I am. - Eh? - Personal reasons. Oh? Please, will you aboard the plane? This is your pilot. You are now going to the United States... without all the annoying delays of more prosaic travel across foreign borders... without the worries of custom, health or immigration departments. Will you all make yourself comfortable? You'll have to sit on your baggage, we have no seats. That's right, a twin engine job. Pilot and plane registration unknown. Carrying 3 men and 3 women, descriptions on teletype. Please impound plane and all passengers, thank you. Maybe if we had time to get these sketches to every airfield... Well, they got the descriptions. Have you any idea how many planes are going to land in this territory today? Our only hope is that they'll come down on a small field... where the attendants know every plane and every pilot. But wouldn't they land at a larger field for just that reason? I wonder. There's one disadvantage to breaking the law, gives you a sense of guilt. Your tendency is to be overcautious and hide. Now, put yourself in the pilot's place. At a big field there too many people. One of them might be a smart law enforcement officer. Remember, you're a smuggler... and too many people watching you makes you uneasy. At least I hope you're uneasy. If not, you and your load of aliens are going to land... here and there's not a thing in the world we can do about it. My friends, soon you will be in the land of your choosing. Now, there are a few instructions. First, the papers we've so carefully prepared, you better check them. Social security, driver's licenses, credit plate and bank book. Everybody got them? - Yes. - Good. Now as to destination, you Mr. Sandring, will be met at East Savannah airport. You take me to Chicago. You'll be flown there in another plane by mister, by our pilot. After landing at a private airfield we will drive to East Savannah airport. From there, you'll be flown to New York or Chicago. Except of course Miss Lorress, who wishes to go to Charleston. She and I will leave you at Savannah and I will personally escort her to Charleston. Heading for the promised land. Dimitri Matthias, 17, tubercular. Refused visa on account of contagious disease. A. Sestina 47. Naturalized in 1929, stripped of US citizenship and deported in 1938. Will you sit down and relax? I guess he figures the competition isn't so rough in the rackets these days... and he wants in again. Elizaveth Alonescu, 35. The lady doesn't believe in paying duty on the jewelry she brings into this country. Marianne Lorress. - Hello sir, Jack. - Hi. Did you get her? We located James' plane. It's been on the ground in Savannah since yesterday and he's off on a tear. It's great. We don't know when or where they're coming in and the odds against picking them up, well... you can figure that for yourself. Cheer up Pete, you did a good job and we might get him yet. The worst that can happen is that this bunch will get through. Yeah, that's the worst. - What you doing? - Soothing, isn't it? Like an elevator. Why you going down? Stopping at Jacksonville to refuel. James, you're crazy to make stops in this hot plane. Got a heavy load. Anyway, relax we're not stopping at the main Jacksonville airport. We are stopping to refuel. No one will get out of the plane... and you'll try not to be seen peering out of the windows. - Hi. - Gas. Ain't never seen that plane around here before, have I? No. Make yourself at home, it'll just be a few minutes. Thanks. Get you right quick. Sure, he gave me the message baby... but how many times do I got to tell you not to call me here? The boss catches me using the phone, I'll get canned. Yeah, I'll see you tonight, goodbye. Hey. That gas you... Hello, hello? - What's the matter? - Immigration on our tails. The guy spotted us. That plane, the one immigration wants, landed here. Taking off now, I think he got scared. Hold it. He just banked and I think he's heading due south after takeoff just now. 8 people aboard, twin engine plane. The color is yellow with green stripe on sides. Just took off from south Jacksonville airport. Lieutenants Carter, Maxon Nd Lynch take off and locate. Control tower to Carter. Patrol southwest, area 6. Roger. Control tower to Lynch. Patrol area two, southeast. Roger. Control tower to Maxon. Patrol area 4, due south. Due south? Do tell. From naval air station, Jacksonville... we've 3 boys up and they can do 100 miles an hour faster than the ship we're looking for. We got them off the ground in time so this plane of yours can't be far away. - Keep you advised. - Right, thank you. You contacted civil aeronautics to radio every plane in the area? All private and commercial pilots is been notified. - They'll report in as they spot the plane. - There'll be no slip-up this time. Just like we had him in a sack. Havana to Jacksonville is 550 miles, they didn't refuel. With that plane and that load, they got maybe enough gas for another 300. If they had an auxiliary tank. Well, they're smart enough not to fly a heavy load in without auxiliary gas. There isn't a field where they can land without being caught... and every plane in the territory is on the lookout. I don't think I'd like to be in that ship right now. We stopped for gas, then no gas. Why? The pilot, he run to the plane like a man with fright. One does not stop to refuel if there is no need. - There was need but no fuel. - Quiet. You don't tell Sestina to be quiet, why no gas? You say we fly to Savannah, that's north. But I see the sun, we go south. My friends, no man and no scheme is perfect. There was always a chance for a slip-up. We've encountered unforeseen difficulties. Now, there's no need to be excited. - We're merely changing our plan. - How? We'll find a field and land, get a car and... There's a plane following us. Navy. Well, I'm sitting in his lap. - What do I do now? - Pursue. Report location, direction and speed. 5 miles due east of Lake Marion. Altitude 2,000, air speed 140. That is all. About 175 miles from Jacksonville, he's got to come down in the next hour. Sit down anywhere and they're over you like a blanket. - Might be best at that. - You like jail? I can get along without them but a 2 to 5 rap is the worst they can hang on us. You're wrong my friend. Once we're caught and they investigate, there's the matter of murder. - Not me, talk for yourself. - Not me either. Why should I kill a man? But there have been killings under orders from an organization. You and I are that organization. We both share the responsibility. You know, it gets pretty tiresome playing tag with a guy when he won't run. Why, I should've brought along some papers to deliver like when I had a bicycle. Anyway, we're trotting along over lake Okeechobee. Still heading south. A friend of mine has a boat near the mouth of the Shark river. - He'll take us to Havana. - What the Navy be doing? He won't be around. He can't follow where we're going. There's not enough gas to take us to the keys. In a very little while we'll be going down. Maybe we can slog through to the coast if we're still alive after we land in that. South of Okeechobee, he's over the everglades. He must be almost out of gas. He must be out of his mind, why doesn't he head for someplace to land? - Where? - Any field, this is committing suicide. Still it follows, what kind of a country is this? Even in the air of the United States police follow. Say, what's for dinner tonight? And if it's stew again I... Hey, wait a minute. Why, that crazy dope is going down. He's going to try and crash land. We over the Shark river. They got themselves a raft. Them things only hold 3 or 4. What good is it for 8? A guy on the raft just shot one of the other men. There's two men and a woman going down river on a raft. 4 others heading into the jungles, where they'll be bait for... crocodiles or water moccasins, it ain't good. Well, I'm heading back now, somebody better get after these characters. You figure the two men on a life raft must be Palinov and the pilot. - But why did they take the girl? - Maybe they were afraid they'd get lonesome. - They're headed inland. - Let's go after them. - Wait, Palinov went down river. - I know Pete. Well, there's an even chance of losing him. He may have a boat in one of the inlets. Maybe he'll get away, maybe we'll get him next year. - That's a chance we got to take. - No. Why, those poor devils won't last a day in this country unless we find them. That's more important than Palinov. If I've got a choice between preventing four people from being chewed up... bitten by snakes or dying of exposure or picking up a couple of smugglers... - well, it's ok with me if they get away. - Mr. Westlake... You're right, I got no argument. One of the people on that raft is an alien, I want to go after her, not Palinov. Look, I'm not going to send you down river after two killers alone... even if the two of us could find those characters in there. The girl is in a spot and I put her there. Watch yourself Pete. - Hung up on a root. - The raft gone. Let's get them out of here. Tourniquet my leg. Above the knee. You two better go ahead, there's no use of us all getting caught. You'll find the key on the boat near the fuel tank. - We can't leave him here. - I intend to be 12 miles at sea by daybreak. We've left people here before he and I. He's right, go ahead. Well, try and get up. I'm sorry lady, I better be quiet until they pick me up. Come, we can't help. Wait. You, there in the boat, who are you? I've been waiting for you Palinov. - Joseph. - Stay where you are. - This is the end of the line. - I'm prepared to make a deal. - You're in no position to make a deal. - You're wrong. We both have something the other wants. If you try to keep me here you'll only take one of us alive. It won't be the one you want. What you want me to do? Start the motor of that boat, the key is next to the fuel tank, find it, quickly. Get out on the pier. Cast off astern. Now get to the far end of the pier, we're coming out. - Throw your gun in the water. - No. Hurry or I'll shoot. - Keep your gun, he'll kill you. - Wait Marianne. Untie the bow. Hold the rope till we get on board. Miss Lorress, you may go with me or stay, as you wish. If you stay, this man will arrest you, you'll face jail, deportation. If we return to Cuba nothing will happen to you. The next time, we'll get through. Would you arrest me Joseph? - I've got to Marianne. - I'll stay. Cast off. Look out Marianne. Are you all right? He isn't going as far as he thinks he is with no gas. He'll be caught as soon as it's clear. With his gift for languages my boss will want to hear him talk. - This boss, he'll want to hear me talk too. - Yes and I'll do some talking. Millions of people right now are pretty happy to be right where they are... but when someone wants to go somewhere else so badly that they'll risk their lives... then it's time for me to help them, not turn them away. - I've learned something Marianne. - I'm glad Joseph. Not Joseph, Karczag, Pete Karczag. Karczag? Pete Karczag, a real American name.
