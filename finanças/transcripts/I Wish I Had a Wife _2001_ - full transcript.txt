It'll look so cool with the presents. I said, no! I don't do stupid stuff like that anymore. Whatever, man. Five pizzas should do it, right? - You think that'll be enough? - Let's see Eight slices per pizza. So five pizzas make only 40 slices. How many kids are there? - Just give them a slice each. - They're pizza monsters. One day, they went on a picnic by a spring. A spring There were tens, no, hundreds. Hundreds of frogs went on a picnic. A snake happen to slither by. And he spotted a frog wearing underwear. It was so funny. A frog in underwear! So the snake asked him. Frog! Frog! why are you wearing an underwear? Do you know what he said? Ma'am, some noodles, please. Miss Jung, tell us. What did he say? Come on, what's the answer? What did he say? Tell us. I work as a masseur! That's not funny. - It's been a long time. - Yes. Good bye. Aren't you going? What are you doing? You must really be bored. Why are you watching old tapes? See you! 'Harvard Educational Center' Excuse me... The umbrella Can you squeeze me in? Do you have some time on Sunday? I am not sure. I know a great noodle place. Would you like to come? I'm not good with words It'd be great if you could join me. Aren't you getting on? You go on. The rain's stopped. I wish it would stop raining now. Shall we get on the next bus... Look! How cute! They're puppies. - Do you like dogs? - I used to when I was young. - What about now? - No, not really. Why not? I had a dog when I was about nine. His name was Happy. He died after eating rat bait. And before he died, it looked at me and cried. I haven't had a dog since. That's so sad. My dog's name was Jjong. - Jjong? - Yes. Jjong. I don't know why all the dogs were named either Happy, Mary, or Jjong. I was very close to Jjong. One day, I was home alone. I was playing with Jjong when suddenly, he barked 'bro, bro.' - What? - It barked, 'bro, bro.' No, it must've been 'ruf, ruf.' I clearly heard it with both ears. It was definitely, 'bro.' It probably had to go and went 'grr.' 'Grr,''bro,' sound alike? It was definitely, 'bro.' Let's say dogs can talk. Then why not 'sis?' Why 'bro?' You're a girl. It barked 'bro.' It just doesn't make sense. It's gotta be 'ruf, ruf.' Ruf, ruf. Why won't you believe me? It was 'bro.' She's pretty. Who is she? Older sister? Younger sister? Your father's handsome. How old he is? If he had lived, he'd be 57, No, about 58. He died when I was six He was a good whistler. I didn't see him go. Maybe that's why I feel like he's still alive somewhere. As if everyone in my family knows but won't tell me where. Funny, huh? It was about this time of year. My dad and I used to take a walk over there. I'm rusty. I used to be really good. Wanna give it ago? Hey Um... could you buy this for me? The pears are really nice. - Your father will like it. - It was a present. - From whom? - A nice person. Let's start... I wasn't going to tell you this but I feel like I have to. Actually... I used to have this girl... You are incredible You're fun, smart and very beautiful. I mean, I'm so worthless and pathetic And you know this by now And yet, you've embraced all... I am... Thank you so much. The only thing I want to say to you I love you my wife! Is it recording? Have to tell you, you're the first woman to come here. Don't make me laugh. You must get bored here sometimes. No, not at all. You're pretty good. You haven't broken the link. I wish I had a wife, too. Why? It'd be great. Have her run errands, clean the house, cook meals, cut apples like this... And scratch my back. You'd be better off with a maid. She wouldn't scratch my back. Also, she wouldn't be able to sleep with me when I wanted her to. - You're talking about a slave. A slave. - You think? Then it'd be real-ly nice to have a slave. It'd be quite convenient to have a slave. How can a woman say such a thing about wives? - Our culture's like that, isn't it? - Not anymore - And a wife - Is she special? Of course. Very special. What's left to eat if you cut it like that? Let me do it. Give me a 1000 won bill. - Why? - You'll see. What are you going to do? Now. Get it right in the middle and... Let's make sure it went through all right. There's a hole. Thank you very much. Do it again. - Never repeat my performances. - One more time. - How did you trick me? - Trick? What are you saying? - It's got to be a trick. - Think whatever you want. Ah, it's cold! Cold, cold! A fox must be getting married. The sun's out but it's raining. A tiger must be getting married. A passing shower, maybe? She's the one. She's not. - She's the one. She's not. - Let's do it together. He's the guy. He's the one. He's the guy. He's the one. He's the guy. - Give me your glasses. - What for? Let me see. Is that better? Yes. It's very clear. Good!. Very Good! There's a person in Japan who doesn't get wet walking in the rain. Who's that? Wata-nomata. (Water no matter) Bisairo-maka ( slip through raindrops) That's a stupid joke! If someone hears us, they'll think we're pathetic! It's funny though! - Where am I so pretty? - I never said that. You said I was pretty when you saw the picture in my ID. Oh that... I meant it was a good picture. No, you didn't. You clearly said I was pretty. I definitely heard it with both ears. No, I said it was a great picture.
