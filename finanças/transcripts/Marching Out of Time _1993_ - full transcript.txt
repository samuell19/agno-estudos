[speaking german] [speaking german] Achtung. HITLER (OVER PA): [speaking german] [cheering] [thud] [whirring] [gasps] Oh, what's the matter, honey? - Did you hear that? - What? What time is it? That noise. There's a loud noise coming from next door, and this is the second time I've heard it. Well, we'll check it out tomorrow, OK, honey? Come back to bed. - Yeah, OK. All right. Yeah, tomorrow, I guess. Find out what's going on. OK? Yeah. [crickets chirping] [music playing] HITLER: [speaking german] [children arguing] WOMAN: What's happening is, air is coming in through that little hole and we're getting it all over our necks here. Can you do something about that? - How much time have we got? - Any minute, dear. Did you you get it? - Yeah, yeah. It's all in the living room, OK? - OK. We're going to go as soon as the window's repaired, all right? OK. Good. Oh, and I found some of your insurance forms. So do you want them? No, no, no. After Christmas with that stuff. - OK. Watch the kids, will you? - I'm watching them. Yeah, sure. I'm watching them. I'm watching them. WIFE: And we close up everything, and air is just rushing over our necks and I get really, really cold. OK? [music - "good king wenceslas"] [children talking] What did I tell you? - Jenny turned it on. - Liar! That's not true. - Quiet! I need quiet. - Why? Because of the noises? Yes, because of the noises. Because there's something-- something going on in the neighbor's house. Something dangerous. And we want to find out what it is. Something dangerous? Well, what if Dad's just crazy? Dad is not crazy. Dad just didn't sleep very well last night, and Dad's been working very, very hard selling insurance for a long-- JENNY: Chris took my Raphael! Chris, come back here! [dog barking] SOLDIER (ON PHONE): Ya, Mein Fuhrer. [speaking german] Ya, Mein Fuhrer. Ya, Mein Fuhrer. Ya vol, Mein Fuhrer. [speaking german] SOLDIER: Achtung. Heil Hitler. [speaking german] [speaking german] [speaking german] And you speak English well? Very well, Heir [german]. Everybody is perfectly trained for this mission. All right, dear. The window's repaired. Let's go. What about those noises? What about them? Honey, they're real. I'm telling you, I'm-- I believe you, dear, but can we worry about this after Christmas? Look, I know what I heard, OK? I heard something-- [whirring] There, that's it. Did you hear that? I heard it too, Mom. WIFE: Honestly, dear. The kids heard it. Didn't you hear it? JENNY: I heard it too, Mom. - See? So what do you want me to tell you? If it's coming from the neighbor's house, then it's him making that noise. And that doesn't bother you? No, it doesn't! Especially when I'm about to leave for Christmas. Now, Jenny, Chris, upstairs and get your jackets. Come on, get this stuff out of here. Fred, I want to go. Come on. You two keep track of your toys, both of you. We don't have time to look for them now. Come on, dear. We have to get going! [whirring] Again! Did you hear that? WIFE: I don't want to hear about it now! Help me with the kids. CHRIS: Mom, do I have to wear this ugly sweater? Did you hear that one? WIFE: Dear, I order you to come here! JENNY: Mom, do I have to wear my sweater that Grandma gave me for Christmas? I don't like it. All right, now I need you to get your red sweater ready. - I'm going over there. - Now? But we've got to leave! - The buck stops here. Fred! JENNY: Mom, I heard it too. Upstairs, Jenny. Now! Fred. Oh! [birds chirping] [sighs] Dr. Memo? Another foreigner. [doorbell rings] [deep inhale] [ticking] [whirring] [doorbell ringing] Open up in there! I'm calling the police! [whirring] [no audible speech] WIFE: He's just totally gone off on this neighbor. Oh, mother, he's back. The phone. Fred, you are clearly not in control of yourself. I am in control, OK? You are obsessed! I'm in control. The phone! [dialing] [ringing] MAN (ON PHONE): Officer Dent. Yeah, police? OFFICER (ON PHONE): May I help? Yeah, look. I've got this next door neighbor over here. I don't think there's anybody home right now, but the thing is, I keep hearing these noises over there. OFFICER (ON PHONE): Is your neighbor at home, sir? Well, yeah. Like I say, I don't think there's anybody in the house, you know, but-- OFFICER (ON PHONE): Your name, please. Yeah, Johnson. Fred-- Fred Johnson. OFFICER (ON PHONE): And your address. Yeah, 39013 Granden. OFFICER (ON PHONE): Sir, I'm going to ask you to wait inside your house-- - OK, yeah. Sure. OFFICER (ON PHONE): --until our car arrives. I'll be here. OFFICER (ON PHONE): Merry Christmas. Please wait. Wait, wait. [inaudible] Amy, wait. [tires screeching] Please. Wait, wait. Amy! Amy, wait. I'll call and cancel. Yeah, yeah. --the time you're ready to join us, all right, Fred. Yeah, fine, but you've got the car! I can't-- I can't join you with you in the car. You come back here! Was I the only one that heard that noise? Was I the only one that heard it? [whirring] SOLDIER: [speaking german] Company, achtung! HITLER (OVER PA): [speaking german] [dog barking] Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil! [chanting] [speaking german] Are you sure about these alleged noises? Yes, I'm sure. All right, Mr. Johnson. Let's take a look. This is Unit 69. I'm checking the premises. MAN (ON RADIO): [inaudible]. Thank you. 69 out. All right, Mr. Johnson. You wait here. I'm going to see if anyone's home. Fine. Good. [knocks] [knocks] There's no answer. I'm going to go around. Well, there's no reason to look any further, Mr. Johnson. Dr. Memo left a memo for the postman. Your neighbor's away for the holidays. Well, how do we know this is Memo's memo? Maybe this isn't Memo's memo. Possibly. But I didn't see any sign of a break in. Can you just sign here, please? Well, what about the noises? Well, maybe Dr. Memo left his TV on or something. Well, can't you search the place? I'd need a search warrant for that. Can't you get a warrant? No, you're the only witness. I see no evidence of the noises you describe, there's no sign of a break in, and there's a note. But if you have any more problems, please feel free to call and ask for me. I'm Lieutenant Butch. Merry Christmas. Lieutenant Butch. [electricity buzzing] [whirring] [grunts] Hello? Anybody home? That's what I thought. Nobody's here. OK. Thank you. Do you know this guy? Are you should have permission to be here? It's OK. It's all right. Do you want to receipt? No, forget about it. Here's my card. We're open 24 hours all day. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Get off my foot. [ticking] [whirring] [whirring] [electronic beeping] [whirring] [electronic beeping] [faster beeping] [whirring] [whirring] [whirring] [electronic beeping] [whirring] [music playing] [chuckles] [rumbling] Oh, God! H-- h-- hi, there. I'm your neighbor. I-- I-- I thought somebody broke in, see, so I came over and-- [thud] [clatter] [buzzing] [rumbling] [whirring] [rumbling] MEMO: At which point it deteriorates into plasma energy. The question then becomes, what happened to it? I was just going to ask-- Well, that, Mr. Johnson, is where I've discovered the vortex crossings not in six, not in seven, not in eight dimensions, Mr. Johnson, but twelve dimensions. A gateway. A kind of white hole, if you will. But created here, on Earth! Do you follow me? Should I be? MEMO: Yes. Because until recently, those who laughed at the idea of travel at the speed of sound, they still tell us instantaneous transportation will forever be beyond man's grasp. And again they are wrong! Mind over matter, Mr. Johnson. Yeah. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter. Now, the way to achieve such speeds is through the instantaneous transportation of matter from one coordinate to another. Now, this little unit acts as a sort of tunnel between refrigerator one and refrigerator two. Any item or person that I put in refrigerator one will be instantaneously transported to refrigerator two. [laughter] Chilling. What are you doing? You shall witness the process. Witness? I, uh-- Don't do anything on my account. Mr Johnson, will you please check the left refrigerator. What? Open the door. OK, it's empty. If you will please check the right refrigerator. Phew. Yeah. MEMO: What? Nothing in it. That's not possible. Yeah, well, it's going to take a hell of a lot more than this to convince me. [grunts] [yelling in german] [alarm blaring] [dog barking] [dialing] No, no, no, no, no. Not the police. They'll confiscate the teleport chambers. Make an independent investigation. I'm depending on their investigation. Yeah, but I might be diagnosed as mentally unstable. You are mentally unstable. [dog barking] [dog barking] WOMAN (ON RADIO): [chatter] There, that. You hear that? A hum. A loud hum. Hum. [typing] [rumbling] And there. Thunder. Loud thunder. Put that down. Loud thunder. Loud thunder. Now. [electronic beeping] I don't understand. The glass was suppose to wind up over here. See, it's a teleportation chamber. Ask the professor. I know nothing. That's because it's his machine. See, he's a nemo, and that's short for nuts. His family has been blowing people up for centuries. He's-- And these Nazis never broke in? No, no, no. They broke out! Well, there's no laws against breaking out. There are only laws against breaking in. Did these Nazis take anything? No, but they could have. Good point. All right, gentlemen, I have your statements here. I'll take your depositions under advisement. And feel free to call me if these thugs make themselves available for arrest. Again, Merry Christmas. Make themselves available for arrest? Make themselves available for arrest? Is that what I pay taxes for? Is that what I pay taxes for? You know who are the Nazis in that situation? It's not them, it's you. You're the Nazi. You're the Nazi. I've got your badge number! As I was saying-- I'm not talking to you. You have no choice. This matter requires some heavy research. Heavy what? [dog barking] [speaking german] [speaking german] SOLDIER: [speaking german] SOLDIER: [speaking german] [dog barking] [interposing voices] SOLDIER: [speaking german] [rifles cocking] Well, one thing's certain. The research is heavy, all right. Man, I'm dead tired. I haven't pulled all-nighters like this since-- MEMO: That's it! German war experiments. Yeah, V1, V2 rocket. So? Not here. There. They're German-- in 1942-- Would you please pay attention. It says here, during World War II a major project was put forward in Germany to transport troops to Britain without relying on the use of air and sea power. The designer was an engineer name Muck. Muck Yes, Muck, consultant to the Messerschmitt Company, who proposed a solenoid chamber to be mounted in a hillside near Liel Coldfield in France. This teleport chamber would then be used to send squadrons of Germans into London from a range of 155 miles? That's inconceivable! I never knew the Germans did research like that. Neither did I. Nobody did, obviously, or we would have heard about it. Hm. This is-- I'm surprised they even tried. I mean, the technology was clearly not available to them. And what about Muck? MEMO: Muck. Muck. Um-- nothing. It doesn't say. - Oh. He must have been sacked by Hitler and sent off to the Eastern Front. Really? What else does it say here? Yes. Any remains of the research facility in the chamber were destroyed during an ally bombing raid in 1944. The idea has never been revived. But this still doesn't explain what there were Nazis doing running around your living room. Mr. Johnson, the answer is plain as day. My vortex must have accidentally tapped into some experiments in teleportation which the Germans were doing in 1942. Their chamber interfered with my chamber, when in fact, they should have been sent to Britain in 1942. That's quite a jump. Yes, I admit it's not usual, but time and space are essentially the same thing. Everyone knows that. If you can travel in one, you can travel in the other. So you-- so they-- and then-- So what do we do now? Oh, if I only knew, Mr. Johnson. Well, OK. I'll see you when I get back. Back? Back from where? I've got to go get some sleep, OK? Tonight's Christmas Eve. I've got to go find my wife. Are we insane? These are German military troops. Relics from the Second World War. Remnants from history. Do you realize-- Count yourself lucky. At least they're not burglars. Excuse me. [door opens and closes] [clicking] [speaking german] [speaking german] [speaking german] [speaking german] [speaking german] [speaking german] [dog barking] WOMAN: You could have waited for him. I don't know why you didn't wait for him. AMY: Mother, I'm telling you, he'll be here! AMY'S MOTHER: --do things your own way? God! Are you sure he'll be here? Mom, give me some credit, OK? Tomorrow is Christmas. Fred wouldn't want to miss it. He'll be here. [sighs] We should have waited for him. No! This time he went overboard. Way overboard. [speaking german] NARRATOR (ON TV): The entire Nazi plan was being stalled because of the RAF. The German heavy artillery were getting hot from firing shells across the channel. Hitler says to the Germans, "Churchill believes he can resist, but I tell you that England will be crushed." What do you want me to say? How do you expect me to react? That's just plain ridiculous. I know it sounds ridiculous. That's because it is ridiculous. You see, they were conducting these experiments during World War II, see. MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): I don't care about any experiments. What do experiments have to do with Christmas, and especially you missing Christmas with your family. But honey-- MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): Get in the car and come here now! Yeah, I can-- I can leave right away. MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): I don't care what it takes, Ben! I'll take a cab. MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): You be here! Yes, dear. [dog barking] Um, would you wait here for me just a second, please? Inshallah. But we keep the meter running, yes? Yeah, fine. OK. [doorbell rings] Yes? Dr. Memo, I'm getting ready to join my wife and my family, and I just kind of wanted to stop by and wish you a merry-- Run, Mr. Johnson! [speaking german] Take off, now! We are going to airport, sir? No, just go, drive! Who are these people? They're gonna kill us. Go! Oh my God! [machine gun fire] [screaming] [clicking] [speaking german] Mr. Johnson, why did you run? You could have been killed! Didn't you say "run, Mr. Johnson?" That was just a figure of speech. Your efforts were futile! God, we're prisoners now. We're war prisoners! Could be worse. Worse? Professor, I don't want to die! Tut-tut-tut! Let us keep matters in perspective! Historically speaking, they may torture, mutilate, vandalize, lobotomize, or sodomize you, but they won't kill you. They need you. Need me for what? I'm-- [dogs barking] [speaking german] Oh, God, they're coming for us. Shh, shh. Be calm! Nazis are not the robots that are commonly portrayed in movies. . [speaking german] [speaking german] Alex Memo? Dr. Alex Memo. And Lopez, Eddie Lopez III, open 24 hours a day. [speaking german] What does it mean, "24 hours a day?" It means-- it really means I'm open at 12:00 Dr. Memo, Mr. Lopez, I am Friedrich von Kontz. I am in command of this force. I'm very impressed by the progress technology has made in only 50 years. I know where we are. We left Germany in 1942, exactly 50 years ago. A miracle of science. Due to some unforeseen accident, I am sure. Neither you nor Mr. Lopez seem to have planned any of this. The obvious solution to this problem is quite simple. We have arrived at this location. Now we want to go back. That can't be done. It implies traveled back through time, a theoretical impossibility! Have you tried it? Commander von Kontz, might you be considering this matter from a one-sided perspective? Closer examination will reveal this to be a very pleasant location, a civilized world! The war is over. You may all retire to civilian life, live in Los Angeles, enjoy the mild weather! And of course, no trials for, you know, war atrocities. War trials? Uh, war crime trials. Allied war trials. Very well, Mr. Lopez. Since Dr. Memo is not cooperating, we are going to shoot you. Look, Herr Ober whatever you are, your name is, you're not gonna get away with this. The police are on to you. And if you think you're tough, wait till you see what happens when the cops get pissed. Right, Professor? Tell 'em about Rodney King! One moment, Commander. I have notes, which are available for your review, if you should require them at your convenience. [speaking german] [doorbell rings] - Dr. Memo? - Yes. There was a gang attack nearby not long ago. I thought since you had a break-in earlier, you might be of some help. Hello. I am Professor von Kontz. How do you do? Lieutenant Butch, LAPD. Your colleague? Yes, it appears we are both interested in the same things. I hope I'm not intruding on some secret research. May I come in? Why not indeed? I didn't wanna bother you with this before, but we found some-- my God! What happened here? Moving out? Part of our research. Quite correct. If you don't mind my asking, what are you researching? If we knew that, we wouldn't be searching for it. Anyway, like I said before, I wanted to ask you something. Of course. We found this on the scene of a crime. It's a Luger automatic pistol, 9 millimeter caliber, P-38. P-8. So you're familiar with it? No, but I know it very well. Yes, well, that's right, a P-8. Anyway, Dr. Memo said something about thugs. I was wondering if, well, the thugs you saw, were they carrying similar weapons? No, there was nothing like that. Quite correct. I understand. By the way, I can't seem to find Mr. Johnson. He seems to have-- I believe he is being taken care of right now. KONTZ: Quite correct. You know, you're probably right. He probably is off with his wife right now. Well, I guess I'll be going. It was very nice meeting you, mister-- Von Kontz. Von Kontz? Correct. A pleasure, indeed. Come again. Oh, and by the way, if you have a problem or an emergency, you can always call 911. Of course. Merry Christmas. Let's see if one comes up. [speaking german] Thank you for your cooperation. When we return to Germany, we will remember you. "Quite correct, quite correct." Oh God, we're dead! Because of you and your stupid machine, we're Dead! You're an optimist. To my mind, the situation is worse, much worse. Ah, so you admit it. You admit it! [speaking german] What are they doing? Can it be that you do not understand the gravity of our situation? Should I? No, of course not. I forget that I live in a country where most students couldn't point out their country on a map! Hey, I did OK in school. 1941, Operation Barbarossa. Germany invades Russia. Hitler diverts troops from the Moscow offensive to attack Kiev, thus postponing the Moscow offensive by one year, one year crucial to the taking of Russia before the Winter War. 1942, Battle of the Caucasus. Germany makes a fatal error in attacking Stalingrad. 250,000 Germans die. It's the turning point of the war. These are merely examples! Examples of what? Oh, think, Mr. Johnson, think! The Germans will probably return to Germany with the historical data that they acquire here. They will be able to avoid all the mistakes they made during the Second World War. They will know Allied tactics, strategy. They will even benefit from historical analysis, preventing them from making further mistakes thus winning the war, changing history, changing everything! Yeah, but Professor, even if they do get back, who's gonna believe them? Anybody can fake historical records. What about the atomic bomb? They could look through any of my physics books and get a blueprint for an atomic bomb! Modern jet fighters, military hardware-- there's an entire range of technology that becomes available to them. I tell you, Mr. Johnson, we are on the verge of rewriting World War II. All right. All right, Professor, but because we are standing here talking now, and know that history hasn't been changed, we know that the Nazis won't manage to get back, and so therefore we-- Good reasoning, Mr. Johnson. Essentially right, but fundamentally wrong! The instant that the Nazis step through that vortex and return to their place of origin, that is when things would change for you and me. You would probably be a member of the Party, and I would be, oh, the minister of propaganda, something along those lines. You mean everything would change? Me, my wife? Wife? In a Nazi regime, you would be the product of genetic manipulation. You wouldn't need a wife! What about my car? You'd probably drive a Volkswagen. I don't think we insure those. In plain language, Mr. Johnson, if we do not prevent these Germans from returning to the Germany of 1942, not Eisenhower, not Patton, not Stalin, not DeGaulle, not Churchill, nobody will be able to prevent them from using their information to win the war! Think of this as the last battle of World War II, the final showdown, the ultimate confrontation, the essential struggle between good and evil! Mom, I can't believe this. He's missing Christmas. Now, dear, I'm sure there must be an explanation. Explanation? Mother, when I left, he was watching our neighbor's house with binoculars. The night before, he wouldn't sleep because of noises. I don't know what I'm gonna do with that man. Well, I can hardly believe Fred would-- Mom, he's going crazy. Noises and this and that. Next thing you know, he'll be hearing music. [german music playing] [speaking german] - Yes, yes, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 1, 2. Come on, you can do it. 1, 2, 3, 4. Yeah! 1, 2. And 1, 2, 3, 4. And 1, yes, that's the way. 1 and 2, and 1 and 2. And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4. And you can do it. Come on. That's great. 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, [laughter] And 1 and 2, 3,4. Come on, yes, that's the way. 1 and 2 and 1-- [speaking german] A little pixie, isn't she? My men are not used to this form of entertainment. It upsets their morale. Yeah, well, I agree. My men have trained hard for this mission. You will cooperate and lead them to key areas of interest in the city to gather information of military significance. I'm putting you in charge. In charge? Yes. You will not be back here before 5:00. I need silence to work. Otherwise, I shoot you. Yes. yes, sir. [speaking german] [speaking german] That will be all. [speaking german] Dr. Memo, please, sit down. I called you here because I want to congratulate a man that I think is a genius. Your machine, Dr. Memo, is a true wonder of technology. Our group engineer informs me that our trip would not have been possible without you. The machine in Germany would not have worked by itself. Your machine allowed us to be transported. The machine is more powerful than you could possibly imagine. Well, fortunately, we were able to use your notes to operate it. By this evening, we will have recreated a tunnel in the vortex of the machine which brought us here. We will then be ready to return to 1942. And to see Germany lose the war. Absolutely not. Because of the facts available here, it will now be possible for Germany to win the war! However, I do not believe my mission would be complete if I did not attempt to convince a genius like yourself to return to Germany with us to contribute his work, his knowledge, to the Reich, to the Fuhrer, to share in the glory and the vision of Germany. As your grandfather did before you with the zeppelin. My grandfather was a scientist, not a supporter of a regime run by a madman! I too have read the history books. And yet the Fuhrer brought Germany out of ruins and into prosperity! And he will succeed where Napoleon and Alexander the Great could not. Your leader will go down in flames and take all of Germany with him! Dr. Memo, once I return to Germany, the war will be won. All of this will be incorrect. By coming here, even by an accident, you have been offered a glimpse into the reality of your struggle. You see what you are fighting for! This is not Alexander the Great! Tyranny of the lazy and incompetent! That is what your democracy has brought you, Dr. Memo! Americans are undisciplined and have drawn the entire world into their lack of discipline! The world will sink without a Reich to bring order! But as long as I am in command here, order there will be! That is a fact [speaking german] [inaudible] [speaking german] [speaking german] What is that? What is that? I didn't buy it? [speaking german] [dog barking] [speaking german] Ah, Mr. Johnson, right on time. All is ready. We're short on time, Professor. This von Kontz is losing it. That is why I have prepared a viable escape plan. What are you doing? What are you going? Don't you understand, Mr. Johnson? The Germans have taken one teleportation chamber upstairs, but they've left us the other. Conceivably, therefore, one of us should be able to teleport into the living room without the Germans noticing. Then we can go for help! - That's great. That's a wonderful idea. That'd be like landing right on top of them. They'll never suspect it! One could sneak through. Well, do you-- do you really think you could escape, Professor? Professor Memo? Have you ever tried this thing on a human? I didn't have a Guinea pig available. Theory suggests the trip should be safe. Which theory? Listen, according to my calculations, the Germans will enter the vortex to leave for Germany with the military and the historical records any moment now. You must stop them. You are mankind's last chance! And they said I'd never amount to anything. Good luck. You too. You know, Professor, if the Germans wound up here, how do we know I'm gonna wind up inside the house and not in some other machine in the past or the future with them? - Well, we don't. And you're sure this thing is safe? I had to make some minor adjustments on the machine. On a trip this short, you may feel some side effects, but that is a risk I shall have to take! It's our only chance. What about you? I stay here to operate the consoles. Wait! Check for flies. - Will you hurry? [dog barking] [speaking german] [speaking german] Finally, you're here! We've still got a Nazi problem. I see you have a Nazi problem, Mr. Johnson, but this is Christmas, and I do not. You can't keep calling the police every time you hear a noise. All right, all right, come on. Take a look at this. These guys are everywhere out here. I don't see anything, Mr. Johnson. Well, they must be hiding in the bushes or something. I swear there were-- I saw people out there! Is there anything else you wanna show me, Mr. Johnson? How did you get to be such a lousy cop? Explain that to me, will you? Well, if you think I've got nothing better to do, you're dead wrong. Not to mention the fact you called me here three times for no good reason, and now you're talking about claims of Nazis and a teleport chamber! Mr. Johnson, I've got a real investigation on my hands right now. Two people have been killed not too far from here. Well, maybe the Nazis did it. They left a lot behind, didn't they? We've gotta get back-up out here. We need-- we need SWAT teams. That's suspicion, not evidence. I'm not calling back-up based upon your suspicions. You get back-up out here now. These guys are Nazis, I'm telling you. And if we don't stop them, we'll all be Nazis too. Yes, Mr. Johnson, I can see that. [speaking german] Dr. Memo, where is Mr. Lopez, Eddie Lopez? I don't know. This is a Luger pistol, a Luger pistol. Toggle joint, breech lock. Very precise instrument. [speaking german] Fred Johnson, California driver's license, living on Grandon Avenue. [speaking german] [dog barking] All right, you wanted evidence? There's your evidence. My God. They're armed with semi-automatic weapons! What did you expect Nazis to be using, BB guns? They're surrounding the house! [speaking german] OK, they just connect to the upstairs phone. Should I try to-- No time for that now, Mr. Johnson. Consider this a moment of crisis. We gotta hold the premises. Know any martial arts, judo, karate? - Yoga. - Yoga? Yeah, yoga. You know what this is, Mr. Johnson? It's a gun. It's a Colt. Lock breech pistol, standardized in 1926. Since then, seen no further change. Needs none. [speaking german] Let's separate. You're kidding, right? It'll surprise them. Come on, move! [speaking german] [dog barking] [speaking german] Where is Mr. Johnson? We know he lives here. Guys, I really don't know any Mr. Johnson. I'll give you three seconds. And then I shoot you. 1, 2, 3. Goodbye. [speaking german] [gunshot] [speaking german] [speaking german] [phone rings] ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, this is the Johnson residence. We can't come to the phone right now., but please leave a message and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. Thanks for calling. [speaking german] MRS. JOHNSON (ON PHONE): Fred, are you there? Please pick up the phone. Oh God, Fred, are we gonna let it all slip away like this? [gunshot] [speaking german] Fred? Fred? Fred, are you there? [dog barking] Freeze! We're tied down. Yeah, I noticed. You're wearing one of their uniforms. Yeah, so? Maybe they'll think you're one of them. What if they think I'm not? I'll cover you. What? Move! [speaking german] Stand back. I'll shoot the lock. [lightning cracks] He's stolen the records. He's gonna change history! What? I'm going after him. You're gonna what? There are some things they don't sell insurance for. Mr. Johnson, wait! [lightning cracks] [speaking german] Whoa! I just dropped in. So I see. Never expected anything like this. All right, but you gotta help me now. We've gotta get those records back. All right, whatever. I just want you know any of this is out of my jurisdiction. Yeah, I understand. I understand. Here, let me introduce you to another friend of mine. Colt 45 caliber, semiautomatic. You two dating? [cheering] All right, Mr. Johnson, where are the records? I don't know where I am! OK, we'll follow the guard. [humming] Could be the room we're looking for. How do you know? how do you know? - Shh. - Heil Hitler. Damn a secretary! After all we've been through? It's just a secretary. That's not the point. She calls the alarm, every Nazi in this place'll be in on us. I gotta think. That's it. - What? The uniform. Pretend you're a German. It worked before. I don't speak German! Then seduce her. What? - Do something. - No. Forget it. Go! Heil Hitler. Ja? Voulez-vous coucher avec moi? You fool! I told you I don't speak German! Body language, you could have used body language. Body language this! You know, I'm sick and tired of you ordering me around! Shh! I hear voices. [speaking german] They're in there. That could be anybody. There's only one way to find out. What? Sorry, Mr. Johnson. [speaking german] Mr. Johnson! Yes, and now I'll-- I'll take those records back. Please? I told you this wasn't gonna work. Freeze, LAPD! Is this them? Yeah. Yeah, that's von Kontz there. And that must be Muck, the inventor. [speaking german] - Who's he? - I don't know. Who are you? [speaking german] Oh, OK. I know. He must be the one who's supposed to take the records back to Hitler. All right, Mr. Johnson. Why don't you get the records and let's get the hell out of here? - Yeah. - Come on, come on. - I'm trying! All right, we're gonna bolt this door. I hear one peep from anybody, you're all sauerkraut! I assure you, we will be silent. - My God? - What? She's gone. The secretary is gone. She went to get help. There's no time to waste. All right, let's go. [alarm wails] Too late. Come on, hurry! OK. [dogs barking] We're toast! Puppy chow. [speaking german] In the machine, quick! I am afraid it is too late for that. Drop your guns. [clattering] That's impossible. How did you get here? Pure science, Lieutenant. We have a second teleportation chamber right here in this bunker. We can teleport right into this room and wait for you. If you hadn't rushed me, we could have checked! "Run, Mr. Johnson. Hurry, Mr. Johnson!" Professor Muck, be reasonable. The time of reason is past! Now it is time to eliminate the last opposing elements. I shall miss you both. My sincere regrets. We will shoot you finally. Auf Wiedersehen. [speaking german] Let's get out of here! [speaking german] [shouting] I think we should call the police. For once, I agree. You think we have a case? [chuckling] All right, let's go. We are reporting live from Antelope Valley, California with Professor Alexander Memo. Professor, if you wouldn't mind, from the beginning? I have a new invention, an improvement! Imagine, if you will, 10,000 horses running together in a synchronous manner, but on a magnetic paralytic converter. I guess I owe you an apology, Mr. Johnson. I should have believed you. You deserve a medal. Yeah, well. Is your wife back yet? Uh, no. So what are you gonna do? Celebrate? All right, let's move 'em out. In this case, it should be theoretically possible to arrive at your destination before you depart. Before you depart? Before you depart. How are you doing, sir? Before you depart? Mommy, is Daddy home? He'd better be! Daddy, Daddy, we had a really big Christmas tree. Daddy, Daddy, we had a really big Christmas tree. Yeah, you missed it. Yeah? Oh well. OK, go upstairs, you two. But Mom, please? Come on. So you spent Christmas in bed, huh? No. No, actually. I-- I hope the noises aren't bothering you anymore. Nope. No more noises. That's all over. OK, where are they? What? Come on, where are they, Fred? What, the Nazis? No, come on, the binoculars. The binoculars. Acknowledge my intelligence. I mean, it's the least I expect. Honey, you know I-- That is what you get for missing Christmas! Enough. All right, that's it. I've had it with you ordering me around. Do you hear me? That's the end of it. Are you paying attention to me or what? Yeah, well, there you have it. Fred, I-- And if I ruined Christmas for you, I'm sorry. Oh! Come on, Janie. Mom isn't mad anymore! I drew a picture, Dad. It's you watching the neighbor's house. Great. What's with that neighbor, anyway? Oh, he's a scientist, a man of vision. Whatever his vision might be. Well, I think he's leaving. I saw him getting into a taxi cab outside. Oh? Here, wait. I'll be right back. Whoa, Professor. You're leaving us? Albeit I did intend to say goodbye. Another research trip? This teleportation machine has earned me quite a reputation. I've been asked to lecture at universities and scientific conventions all across the country. So the Memo tradition lives on. Only because of you. I owe you my life, my invention. I am greatly in your debt. Hey, how long you need? I don't like this neighborhood! In any case, I have shut off the keyboards. There should be no further disturbances. Good luck. And I'd like to apologize for any little commotion my machine may have caused. Water under the bridge. Bridges are obsolete. Farewell. Bye.
