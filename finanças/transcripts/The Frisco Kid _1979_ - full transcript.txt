Oh, my God, help me! Just this morning me and my brother got the news. All right, who's next? [ Sobs ] Our mama's dying in San Francisco. What am I going to do? Oh, there must be some way That a person can go to San Francisco In another way than the boat. Not for us, sir. Just 10 minutes ago me and my brother Sold our horses and our wagon So as we could purchase tickets on this here boat, And now we ain't got neither. Well, perhaps if you go to the man and you told him your troubles and you give him back the money he would give you back the wagon. You think he'll do it? If he is a good man, I think he would do that, yes. Mister, would... would you help me, please? I'm not much good explaining myself. [ Sobbing ] I usually just start to cry. I will do that. I would be happy to do it, But I don't know if I would be much help to you, With the way I speak English. Wait, you don't have to carry the bags! My brother, his name is Matt. Say, what's your name? Avram. My name is Darryl, Darryl Diggs. Anyway, my brother's got a temper. Sometime he just unloads, you know what I mean? Can't I help you to carry... No, that's all right.

We need our horses and our wagon back So we can get to San Francisco To see our mum before she dies. I sympathize with your misfortunes, fellas, But you've got to understand. I'm in the business of buying and selling, And I don't sell unless I can make a profit. But we don't have no money to give you a profit. Then we don't do no business. Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Jones. How much profit do you need from these gentlemen? $50. Oh, $50. That's it, Matt. We're sunk. I'm sorry, Avram, I'm sorry I wasted your time. Well... Perhaps I could pay the $50.

They sent me a picture before I left Poland. Whoa-ho-ho, yeah! What you think? Aw, that's my kind of woman. You son of a gun! You son of a gun, you! Ha ha ha ha! Shee-it! Aah! I guess so. This other one ain't bad neither. [ Yawn ] Good night, rabbi. Good night, chowboy. Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf! Once through this one and pull tight. Well... It's nice meeting up with you, pard. Nice meeting up with you, pard. You got it straight? Oh, sure. Right from this tree, I head straight north five or six weeks Till I come to the flat country. Yeah? Then I make a left for two days. That way I avoid the Indians. Then I cross the river, And I make a sharp right, away from the mountains. Once I get to the desert, God willing, I just continue straight as piss till I come to the ocean. Take a left, Keeping the ocean on my right shoulder, And just hot-tail it right into San Francisco. Good? Pretty good. Well... I hope you make it. Okay, wait, horse. Good. All right, go, horsie. That's it. Straight ahead. Speak any Mexican, do you? No, why do you ask? Oh, nothing. Just curious. If you should ever come to San Francisco, I hope that you'll call on me And we could talk over some nice times. Come on, horsie. Hey! That way! That way? Well, of course I know it's that way, But first I have to go around that big log Before I can go that way. You mustn't turn a horse so quick! That's how accidents happen. You've got to start nice and slow. That way you get off on the right foot. Oy, oy, oy, oy... Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy! Hey! What kind of crazy horses they got in this country? What do you call this in Jewish? A...a tuches. Well, you keep your eyes on this too-kus, And don't take 'em off till I tell you. Keep my eyes on the tuches... [ Horse whinnies ] Shee-it! Don't get no closer to that edge, rabbi! What kind of word is that? What word? You always say "shee-it" at a certain moment. "Shee-it"? Well, that's, uh... That's, um, what do you, um... Well, you must have a word in your language that you... What do you say when you get took by surprise? Oy gevalt! Oy ga-vault? Ya. That's it. That's what shee-it means. Oy shee-it! Yeah, that makes sense. Slow... Slow, horsie. Well, this is it. Where are you going? Back down the river a few miles, a good place to cross. Why not here? Here? Here is a good place to die, But it ain't a good place to cross the river. We just jump in and swim straight across. Simple as pie. Want to kill yourself, go ahead. I don't like the odds. I'm taking the long way. Now that shouldn't be so difficult. [ Rattlesnake rattles ] [ Yelling in Yiddish ] [ Horse whinnies ] Wait! Wait a minute! Where you going, horsie? Whoa! I didn't say where to go yet! Whoa! Whoa! Oh, no! Oh, no! Whoa! Whoa! Oy, oy, oy! Oy, oy! I almost got it! Shee-it! Aah! Hey! That snake could have killed me! Damn me, if he can do it, I can do it! Yah! Yah! Help! Oy gevalt! God damn! Uh-oh. Shit! You know, rabbi, You're one crazy bastard! Remember! I'm the kind of person, When he says he's going to do something, He does it! You got a guarantee, huh? He could be laying out there, Somewhere dead in the wilderness! Bite your tongue! You're talking about my future son-in-law! Ach! [ High-pitched giggle ] Somebody maybe should remind Sarah Mindl. Heh! Rosalie! Rosalie! Get your sister away from that...idiot! I'm not mixing in. I'm not mixing in! This is a nice little town. Cold, but nice. Yeah, I guess. I don't think that fellow is 100 percent. WOMAN: ♪ Loved by the moonlight ♪ [ Slurring ] Loved by the moonlight... I'll see if I can find us some place to stay. Some place pretty cheap. Yeah, pretty cheap. ...By tomorrow morning. This ain't traveling weather. I know this place ain't fancy, but... But it's got a roof, And like you say, it's cheap. [ Chickens cluck ] So we just stay here for a couple of months, And then head south. No, I've wasted too much time already. When they banged on your head, They must have mushed your brains! If you're so God damned worried about time, How come you don't ride on Saturday? I told you, It's against my religion to ride on the Sabbath. Well, I got me a new religion, too, And one of the things you ain't allowed to do is die! Them's real mountains out there, And that's a real blizzard building up! I'm telling you we can't make it! I can make it. God damn! I ain't going to let you talk me into this. It's just impossible! Every God damn Indian knows that! Every God damn trapper knows that! I know, you don't like it when I talk that way... But I'm telling ya, You ain't going to talk me into it this time! Am I trying to talk you into anything? Good night! Have a nice trip. Good night, and thanks for everything you did for me... Up until the time I needed you the most! Don't wake me in the morning. I'll try to be as quiet as possible. So what do you think now, rabbi? It's cold. You should see it in winter! AVRAM: In the Talmud it says, "Find thyself a teacher," and this I had done. However, there were times I feared That he would find another pupil. Get your horse down! If we'd have gone on, we'd have froze to death! No! Make one! Move! Come here! Closer! Wait! We are doing this to keep warm, aren't we? Uh-huh. In that case, you can put your arms around me. Come here, darlin'. That's better. Hey, look! I think we've found the Garden of Eden! Well, it ain't exactly the Garden of Eden. What a wonderful place America is! There are no walls around these cities. You don't have to worry about the soldiers coming in from the next town and killing people. You know, I think this is the West. We're in the Wild West here, Just like the books I read in Poland. This is a wonderful city. They've got banks and restaurants. They've got merchants of all kinds here, And look at the people, how they're dressed. I think those are cowboys. Howdy! Howdy. Pull up here. I've got a little business i want to take care of. Hold on to the horses, will ya? I'll be right back. Move it! What's happening? We just robbed the bank. What did you say? We just robbed the bank! What do you mean, "we"? The bank! They just robbed the bank! Oy gevalt! [ Gunshot ] We need a posse, boys! What for? I said we need a posse! To hell with you! I ain't got any money in the bank. But they robbed it! Well, go get them. It's your bank. $5 a man when we catch them. - $5? - $7.50! - Not worth it! - I'll go for $11. - $10! - $11! All right, you bastards, $11. Let's go! Don't get comfortable. We can't stop here. How could you do this to me? It's what I do. I'm a bank robber. But you made me a bank robber! So what? You get your half. Get out of my life! What? Get out of my life! Get out! I don't want you here! Get out of my life! Hold it! Take it easy, take it easy. You better cool off. Guns? You're going to shoot guns at me? Guns? [ Speaks Yiddish ] You know, you're really crazy. Sure I'm crazy! I'm a bank robber! Who else would rob a bank but a crazy? You ain't no bank robber. All you did was hold the horses. You think I could tell them that? Sure. And would they listen? Yeah, they'll listen! Then they'll hang you! And what if I give back the money? You mean your half. Yes, I mean my half. Well, first they'll string you up by your balls, Until you tell them where the other half is. Then they'll hang you! [ Horse whinnies ] Make up your mind, partner. Oy! Oy! Oy gevalt! Go fast, horsie! Go fast! Wait, Tommy, wait! I'm coming! Looks like fresh tracks. They was here, all right. Here's some blood. That was me. I knew I got that one. If you did, he sure took a long time to start bleeding. All right, let's go, men! Let's look for a tree for the hanging! Hey, hey! Hey! Another river? I wish that we could build a bigger fire. Well, we can't! Lucky to have this much. They ain't that far behind us. By sunrise they're going to catch on to my dumb-ass trick. There. That ought to warm you up. $320 each. Not bad, huh? Now, ain't you somethin'? Tell you the truth, I never figured you was gonna take the money, tainted and all like it is. So you're rich. What are you going to do with it all? When we get to the next town, I'm going to send it back. Well, I'd be careful till then. It's dangerous out here. A fellow could get himself robbed. I'll keep out a watch for strangers. [ Avram sings prayer ] TOMMY: About ready. [ Singing ] Church over, we'd better make tracks. Figure they know pretty much where we're at. It ain't going to take them too long to find us. Hold still. Hold still, horsie, be good. TOMMY: Can't really afford such a late start. What the hell are you doing? I don't ride today. What are you talking about? Today is Saturday. So? I don't ride on Saturday. Well, I know that. But don't tell me you ain't going to ride today! I ain't going to ride today. I asked you not to tell me that! That's what I'm telling you. But this ain't no ordinary Saturday! Why is this Saturday different from all other Saturdays? 'Cause this Saturday there's a hanging posse chasing us! I promise you, right now they're doubling back to that stream! I don't ride on Saturday! Jesus, you give me the peedoodles! There ain't no Jews in that posse, you know! They'd just as soon string you up On Saturday as any other day! They don't give a shit for your holidays, Don't you know that? God damned if I'm going to walk! I've asked you not to say that. You stupid, ignorant, son of a bitch! I ain't waiting around for that posse to find us! I'm leaving! Who's asking you to stay? Goodbye! Hyah! There it is. I'm going to show you something. Look over there. You know what that is? Yes. Well? When the sun sets. Know what you are? You're a real mesh-a-goona! Meshugena. [ Horse whinnies ] They're coming. Damn you! They're coming. Now? Not yet! Now? Not yet! Now! Now! Thank God. TOMMY: Longest damn day of my life. Now these are apple trees. Hot! It's hot. Will you quit that? They ain't coming. How do you know? 'Cause it's been four days. I'm telling you, they ain't coming. Now just relax! What's that? Indians! Let's go! Go, horsie! [ Screaming battle cry ] Go! They ain't serving tea, you know. Oy! Go, horsie! Shee-it! Quick! Go quick, horse! Can't they see that we're friends? What did they want? They wanted our horses, Our guns, our scalps, Our heads... Jesus, I don't know. They wanted our asses, that's what they wanted. But why? What did we do? They've been shit on by white men so long, They don't ask questions no more. They wasn't painted up for one of your bar matzivahs, I can tell you that! Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, my God! What's the matter? Oh, my God. What's the matter? Oh, god! The Torah! Wait! Wait, damn it, wait! I ain't going with you this time, God damn it! Let go! That was war paint, you stupid ignoramus! They won't talk, they'll just kill you! Will you let go? I ain't going, you son of a bitch! Who's asking you? So long, sucker! Have a nice funeral! You dumb asshole! TOMMY: Oh, God, get me out of this! Oh, please, please... I'm your friend. I don't want to die. Please! [ Avram chants in Hebrew ] I never did anything wrong. How did I get into this? Who the hell are you? Me rabbi... Jewish rabbi. Come from far away, Across big ocean. I read much books about Indians. [ Laughs ] You don't speak English very well. [ Speaks native language ] TOMMY: He's a holy man, chief. Speaks to the spirits every morning and every night, And he's so good and kind and gentle... Just a sweetheart of a man. Why, even when we robbed the bank, And the posse was chasing us, he wouldn't ride on Saturday, No, sirree, 'cause that's his holy day, And he didn't want to make his spirits angry. Can he make rain? Rain? Rain? Oh, you should have seen the rain! I mean buckets of rain, coming down day after day. I didn't know what the hell we were going to do with all the stuff. And if you want to talk about snow -- Don't talk about snow! You came for this? Yes! I have read this book. Did not understand one word. What do you call this book? Torah. Th-troah? T-- The Torah. Torah... Good. [ Laughs ] Will you trade your horse for Torah? Yes. Your horse and your boots? Yes. And your clothes? Yes. And everything else you own? Yes, everything. Even your knife? I have no knife. [ Crowd murmurs ] You have no knife? No. If I give you back Torah, Will you purify your soul through fire? Yes. Shit. If I let you go, May I keep Torah? No! [ Speaking native language ] Rabbi with no knife, You are a brave man. And you, who speak to indians as if to little children, Your heart is big. Not as big as your mouth... but you have good feelings inside. Thanks, chief. Thanks very much. [ Chanting ] Thanks. L'chaim! You should just be healthy. And that's the most important thing. Ah! Now, this is a good drink. [ Speaking native language ] Wonderful! Wonderful and nice dancing. Nice does not make rain. Yes or no, can your god make rain? Yes. But he doesn't. That's right. Because that's not His department! But if he wanted to, he could? Yes! What kind of a god do you have? Don't say my God. He's your God, too. Don't give him to us. We have enough troubles with our own gods. But there's only one God. What does he do? He can do anything! Then why can't he make rain? Because He doesn't make rain! He gives us strength when we're suffering. He gives us compassion when all that we feel is hatred. He gives us courage when we're searching around blindly, like little mice in the darkness, But He does not make rain! [ Thunder crashes ] Of course, sometimes just like that, He'll change his mind. [ Drumbeat ] [ Chanting ] This is really good food. Watch out for that stuff. What's the matter with you? I love this fruit. It ain't fruit! I'm telling you. Watch out. Eat. See that? Good! I don't know what the recipe is, But this is good. Tell me, What do Jewish people do to express joy? Just like the Indians. They dance just like this. Show me. Me? Oh, I'm not a very good dancer. Do you feel joy? Yes, I do, very much. Then show me, please. Dance with my people. Well, I'll take a crack. TOMMY: No. [ Chief speaks native language ] I want him to dance with you. He is going to show you how his people dance. [ Thunder ] Well? Ready on the tommies? Eins, zwei, drei, vier, Fünf, sechs, sieben, acht, and go! Everybody dance, Always with the left foot first. First we start slow, Then we're going to do some nice foot work. That's it. That's good with the hands. Watch that lady. I think that lady's a Jewish Indian. Just have a little fun, And don't you worry what the neighbors are thinking. [ Sings in Hebrew ] Watch the left foot. Try to keep in time with the other boys and girls. That's it. Just get a message from your feet. They are talking to you all the time. I'll tell you, if you could move the waist and the hips a little bit, you'll be very happy with the results. And walk toward the left, the left shoulder out -- That's the way we do things in the old country -- And hold on tight. Here we go, And don't get wet! Move a little faster. Listen to the beat. Stay close. Everyone shout! Get ready. Go, let's jump! Now we do a jump, a little bitty jump. That's the way we do it. Try a little jumping, One, two, three. Again, again. Ready for a trick? Here we go, clap your hands. One, two, three, four. Two, three, four. I think you've got it now. You've got the swing of it. Everybody clap your hands. One, two, three, four. One, two, three. [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Bell ringing ] Hello. Uh... Am I in the right place? I hear bells! Oy, vey. Am I... Is this... Uh, I'm not... I think I was a little sick. Wasn't I? Um... You want to ask me anything? He can't, cuz. Tommy. How are you? Good. You look a lot better. Boy, you were really out of your head last night! You had me really worried. Could you eat a little something? Always. Good. They're waiting breakfast for us. Oh. Leave that Torah here. It will be safe. Had enough trouble with that Torah. Oy. You're okay, huh? Yeah. Oh, good. Why don't you listen to me when I tell you about that stuff? Do you think I'm talking to you for my own good? I tell you something, I'm not talking to you for my own health. What's the point of all my experience, If you don't listen to me? Come on, they're waiting breakfast. AVRAM: You mean they never say anything...ever? TOMMY: See, once they take the vow, they stop talking. Not one word. There's an old man here, Father Joseph, He ain't spoke in 45 years. 45 years! What? How do they...? What if their friend comes, And they want to ask their partner something? What do they do? 45 years? How can you live that long without ever asking a person one question? Good! I like this food.

That's where the gold is. But I don't want you to go. Well, I got to go. Why? Well, I've got people to see, banks to rob, you know? I've got to make a living. Who's going to be the best man at my wedding? What do you mean? That's for one of your Jewish friends. You've got to pick your best friend for that. You -- You are my best friend. I'm your best friend? You're my only friend. Now listen to me, cuz. You keep your eyes on this tuches, and don't you take them off until we get to San Francisco! I never had a best friend. It's cold! California is cold! I've got a bank robber! You think a bank robber is stronger than God? I'm a rabbi! I can beat any bank robber! [ Gunshot ] DARRYL: Swimming lesson's over. MR. JONES: Look at 'em, mermaids of the ocean. DARRYL: Caught them with their pants off! It's time for a little comeuppance, boys! [ Empty gun clicks ] [ Empty gun clicks ] TOMMY: He's out of bullets!

Give me the whiskey. Get the saddle bags. I'll show you how to fix me up. All right? You've never killed a man before, huh? Get me the saddle bag! Ahh! Now go to sleep. You're still acting kind of funny. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. You go to sleep now. Hey, rabbi... You think God sent me to show you the way? Perhaps. I must be some kind of angel. Well, it's sure a pretty day, ain't it? Yes. It's a beautiful day. Oy! Howdy! Hello. Howdy. Howdy. How do? Hello, there. Do you want something? Well -- Do I want? No! Well, gol'dang it, ma'am, my name is Tommy Lillard, and I come from the Texas -- Uh, I come from Texas. And, uh... Excuse me if I gave you a little startle there. I was a little startled there for a second. What do you want? Well, I came to bring this thing here, for Mr. Bender, If'n I got the right house and all. You do. I'm his daughter. Yeah, I know. Oh, you're the daughter? You are the Bender daughter? Oh. Howdy. Would you care to come in? Well, I would like to, but, uh, thanks, no, Because I got a friend waiting at the saloon. And, uh, my other friend, the rabbi, asked me to bring this here to you. I mean, bring this to your father. What is it? This thing? I don't know. I think it's some kind of Torah. A Torah? Yeah, I think that's what he called it. So, where is he? Who? The rabbi. Where is the rabbi? Oh, where is the rabbi? The rabbi. Well, I don't rightly know, ma'am. The last time I seen him, I was busting my britches in the cat house. And, uh, my friend, the rabbi, asked me if'n I should ever come Frisco way, would I drop by this house and do him this favor. Oh. Anyway, it was nice to, uh, make your acquaintance, ma'am, and, uh, I'd, uh... Is something wrong? No, no. It's just that I didn't know that your eyes would be so brown. How would you know that? How would I know that? Ha! Ha! How would I know that? That's right! How could I know that? I couldn't know that! Well, I'd better get going. I hate to keep my sidewinder waiting. So, I just give you that to give to, uh, to your father. Oh, well, wait! Wait! Papa! No, no! Don't call the papa! I'd really better get my ass out of here. So thanks, and adios for everything. Wait, wait! Please! Papa! Wait! Wait! Papa. You ain't gonna eat none of this? I don't understand you, man. If you don't eat, you're gonna sure lose your strength. This is a good piece of meat. You ought to have something. You got to eat something. Thank you. Gracias. Now, look, you go up and change. Then we'll go together, and we'll tell your people That the new rabbi has arrived. All right? I've told you that I can't be a rabbi. Don't you tell me that! Just don't say that again! Not after what I've been through to get your goddamned ass here alive! If you hadn't shot that man, we'd both be dead! Do you understand that, you ignorant asshole? You do understand that? He was going to kill you, then he was going to kill me. Am I right? When you shot that son of a bitch, that was not a sin! Then what the hell are we talking about? When those men were shooting at you, I ran to save the Torah. So? I understand that. You're a man of God. I understand that. I wasn't thinking about God. I didn't do it because of God. I don't know one thing about God. I was thinking about a book. I cared more for a book than I did for my best friend. I don't know if you can understand that. I don't want to insult you, but do you understand what I mean? I chose a piece of paper instead of you. But I forgive you. I know that you do. But you're a good man. I am a good man. I am. But I'm not a rabbi. Don't say that! Tommy, I'm not a rabbi. Don't say that! You are a rabbi. I'm a bank robber. I'm a card player and a whoremonger, that's what I am! You are a rabbi! You can fall in the mud, you can slip on your ass, you can travel in the wrong direction, but even on your ass, even in the mud, even if you go the wrong direction for a little while, you're still a rabbi! That's what you are! Right? If I'm who I am, How come you ain't what you are? You're just too goddamn good to have the same rules! You answer me. You look me in the eye, and you answer me! Don't you dare sit there and not answer me! You'd better have an answer for me! [ Speaking Yiddish ] Huh? [ Speaking Yiddish ] What's he talking about? What's he talking about? He wants to know if you're the rabbi. Me? You tell him. I'm the rabbi. You're the rabbi? Funny, you don't look like a rabbi. I just traveled 3,000 miles across this country. And I was thanking my best friend for getting me here alive! My name is Avram Belinski, and I come from a small village in Poland. And don't you judge people by their appearance! We have a rabbi! We have a rabbi! Excuse me, rabbi. Please forgive me. I am very, very happy to see you. Let's have a drink, for God's sakes! Wait a minute, wait a minute! Who's paying? Take from the building fund. Everybody to the bar! Pardon me, everybody. Please, please make a little room here. Thank you. I'm so sorry to disturb you. Bartender! Drinks for all my friends. Well, what will you have? Straight whiskey! Whiskey for everybody! Rabbi... This is Mrs. Bender. Welcome. Welcome, rabbi! And this is my younger daughter, Rosalie. I know that in our marriage agreement I mentioned my other daughter, Sarah Mindl, But what difference does it make if... Papa! You know, your father thinks that you can just switch one promised wife for another promised wife. But I know that it isn't that way in America. So, please, don't feel obligated in that way. Wouldn't you like to dance with me? I would. I would love to dance with you, But you know, a rabbi shouldn't do that. A rabbi can dance with his fiancée, can't he? [ Classical ballroom music plays ] [ Gunshot ] Bartender! Yes. You get out here! Yes. Now, you listen good! That man killed my brother. Me and him gonna have a fair fight! There ain't gonna be no advantage taken here. We're going outside. Bartender, I just want it down for the record, this is going to be a fair fight. Rabbi. Rabbi, let's go. No more killing. Oh, yes. Oh, yes! Please... don't do this. It would be terrible if some innocent people in here got hurt, wouldn't it? [ Gasp ] Huh, rabbi? Is what he says true? Is it? Get outside, both of you. Rabbi! You got a gun? Well, there you go. Well, don't worry. You know this gun. This is the one you used to kill my brother Darryl with. There's going to be no advantage taken here. There. Just like a man. Make your move! Well, don't just stare at me! You ain't gonna get away with it like that! Draw, you stinking coward! Stop it, please! You yellow bastard! Draw! You draw, or I'm going to bash your head in! That was just to get your attention! Now listen to me! The war is over! You understand that? No more killing! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] You reach for that pistol again, and I'll blow your head off! This ain't your fight! This is my fight! But he killed my brother, and I'm going to kill him! You and your partner and your pig-faced brother ambushed us on the beach! And if the rabbi hadn't pulled the trigger, you would have shot us both in cold blood! Reach for it... Please! Wait a second. Now wait a second. Let's talk this over. I'm not a rabbi for nothing, you know. I think I have a solution. Just wait a second. This is a very big country. I'll tell you what I think is the best thing. I'll take San Francisco, You take the rest of America, And if you ever come back to this place again, I don't think you're going to get off so easy. Now get the hell out of here. Would somebody please show this poor asshole yhe way out of town? [ Cheering ] [ Breaks glass ] Mazel tov! Mazel tov! AVRAM: I've crossed rivers, and I've climbed high mountains, and I was captured by wonderful Indians. I did so many things. God has truly blessed me. And what's more, how many rabbis can say that they had a bank robber for a best man? Mazel tov! Music, maestro, please!
