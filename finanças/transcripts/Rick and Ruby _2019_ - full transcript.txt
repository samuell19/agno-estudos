- You moving in, sweetheart? - Sorry about that. Mind if I post up here for a little bit? I've had a fucking day. - No, no, come on in. We don't get many fillies in the stable around here anyway. - Where are you coming from, hon? - Can I get a whiskey neat and then a double? Farther up North. - Ooh, that's some road medicine right there, ain't it? You're after my own heart, the way you throw that whiskey back, young lady. - Where you headed? - Well, right now either a motel or a repair shop. My car shit the bed a while back. You fellas wouldn't know of any auto-repair shops one around here, would you? - 'Fraid not, ain't a lot in this area except this here bar and a Baptist church about 20 miles up the road and ol' Lou's Sporting Goods shop a few miles past that. I tell you what though, ol' Chick here, he's great with anything with wheels and I got a cot in the back if you wanna stick around with us for the evening. - Promise I don't bite, much. - I wish I could stay all night, boys. But I really need to get to a motel tonight. Girl's gotta have all her amenities, you know? Plus, you wouldn't want to see me without a good night's rest. Don't want to let the monster out. - Hey now, come on now, don't be like that. Party with us for a bit. We'll set you straight. - Name is Charles but since we're becoming real fast friends, you can call me Chick? And you are? - Leaving but it was a pleasure, Charles. - I don't like your attitude. I'm just trying to be your friend here. - I think I've had enough friendship for one evening, excuse me. - You'll have to forgive Chick here, he's a little aggressive with his first impressions but I promise you, he's a real gem. And he's hung like a goddamn horse too. - Now, I don't normally dig chink-y chicks, but I been on the road real, real, long time. And a slit's a slit. - Back up motherfucker. - Easy lady. Don't want you getting pricked, yet. - Get off, no, no! - Come on! Come on, baby. - Get the fuck off me! Come on, baby. - No, no, now, now. The less kicking and biting you do, the less kicking and biting we're gonna do, you got me? - You ready for some hurt now, baby? - Are you? Fuckin. - What the fuck? - Jesus fucking Christ. My back, fuck. Ruby, why didn't you let me out sooner? Fuck. The sun's been down for over an hour. God I gotta stretch it out. Ruby, I swear, you get kinkier every waking day. Next time you're trying to get dick down, just leave me in the car. - Really, right now? - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Where are my manners? Hi fellas, I'm Rick, I see you've already gotten acquainted with Ruby and I do apologize for the interruption but would you mind if I have a smoke? Okay, seriously, 12 hours, 12 hours in that fucking box. - Who the fuck is this? - That's Rick. - Yeah, I'm Rick. Come on man, we just met. Did Ruby say something? I bet she did, she tends to get a little lippy, get a little attitude, you know? When she hasn't gotten any in a while. Fuck off, Rick. - See what I mean? Ooh, she did a little number on you now, didn't she? Ooh, almost messed up that handsome old face of yours, didn't she? But she didn't. No, she didn't you're still , you're still a sexy hunk of meat. This fucking faggot sure does like to hear himself talk, don't he? - Jesus Christ, what part of cousin-fucking America did you drive us into, Ruby? Speaking of which, do any of these guys actually work for Jackie Maddox? - We're not even near Maddox yet, Rick. - Seriously, so you just fell into this gang rape situation? - All right, hands on the head fag in a box. - Well, at least he's clever. - These Yankees are into some kinky shit. - Yeah, what the fuck you doing dragging him around in that damn box for anyway? Is this some sort of queer sex thing or something? - Wow, they really can't get off the gay stuff, can they? As much as I'm sure that that answer would thrill you if I said, "yes," the truth of the matter is actually much more interesting. - You best fucking stop, boy. - I'm actually very, very sick. I've got this thing that makes me ravenously thirsty all the fucking time and just to top it all off, also makes me fucking allergic to the sun! Really, really allergic, like death by peanut allergy allergic. So, I'm driving around with Ruby right now trying to find the fucking dick nose that gave me this shit and ruined Miami Beach for me for-fucking-ever! - All right, last chance fucker. - Hence, this luxurious, and wonderful so-comfortable trunk that she drags me around in during the day so that my gorgeous, sickly self doesn't get into any kind of-- - Your gay ass boyfriend sure was a chatty one, wasn't he? - He certainly is. - Damn, whoo! Man, I haven't been shot in like, five months and I forgot how exhilarating it is. - Son of a bitch. - God damn, I don't know what they feed you hick fucks out here but I could swear you were grass-fed. Jesus, Ruby. - Here, you piece of shit, redneck fuck! - Do you want some of this, freak? Really? - A knife? - You fucking, get fucked too. Snap, crackle, - How's this feel, you fucking cunt? Fuck. - Fuck, why? - Give it a rest, Charles. Now, what's the worst hickey, you ever gave a chick, Chick? - Stop fucking shooting me! - God damn it! God damn it! - You know and I even gave you a head start. Whoo! Man. He got a stick in the ass! Fitting. - Yeah. - What, that's funny. Come on, now. Damn it. - Okay. Looks like six more hours to Maddox. We should probably go. - Yeah. - Yeah.
