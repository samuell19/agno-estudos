[SHEEPS BAA-ING] [SHEPHERD URGING SHEEP ALONG IN ARABIC] [SOUND OF PLANE APPROACHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Somebody let me out. All I want to be is free. Too many men on top, telling me what to be. Everybody talks about peace, war is all we see. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Put an end to our own blindness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Now! Our brothers across the sea never had food to eat, while we rape mother earth, there's no clean air to breathe. Politicians never lie. In truth, they never see. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Put an end to our own blindness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Beautiful world, I've come to say goodbye. What they're doing to you makes me want to cry. Somebody let me out. All I wan to be is free. Too many men up top, telling me what to be. Everybody talks about peace, but war is all we see. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Put an end to our own blindness. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Stop right now! Somebody's got to stop this madness. Do it somehow. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Yeah! Somebody's got to stop this madness. [SPEAKING ARABIC] Taxi. Here, fare. Come on, here. Taxi. Here, sir. Here. Taxi, here. Taxi. - Taxi. Over here! Taxi. Here, sir. Taxi. Here, here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Good morning. Good morning, Rahim. - Morning. - Morning. Morning. Mr. Kadish, I've made a decision. I'm going to play no more tennis foursomes with only three guys show up. Oh, come on, Dunniger. Aren't Mr. Kadish and I good enough for ya? I ain't ambidextrous, Mr. Gamble. Hey, what did happen to Shannon, where is he? With his doctor. What time is it? 8:30. I've missed my tennis. You're impossible. I'm serious! Sport is a new style in diplomacy. Like my tennis. I should be out there showing the flag. The flag? You're not exactly [INAUDIBLE]. No, it's doubles, see? It's me and Kadish from chancery, Gamble from the press, and Dunniger from security, showing the world that ordinary Americans can come together and play tennis regardless of race, color, or in Dunniger's case, BO. [BABY CRYING, INDISTINCT CHATTER] Have a good day saving the world. [SPEAKING IN ARABIC] [BIRD CHIRPING] [HORSE NEIGHING] Morning, Dick. Sorry to drag you way out here. That's all right. How was the breakfast? Oh, very pleasant. Shannon is a nice man. Oh yes. Feels awkward to like someone you're supposed to despise. He's determined to make this big speech to the Press Club today. Oh, no. Not the red menace in the Middle East. That's the one. Now go over it, do what you can with it, and be tactful. Remember, he's got a lot of clout back home. [MUSIC PLAYING] God damn. What? This man thinks that Syria and South Yemen are the same place. I mean, is it really our job to baby these idiots? It is, indeed, Mr. Shannon. Sorry Mr. Ambassador. Well, I like juggling. A good diplomat, someone once said, should be able to keep four balls in the air without losing his own. Good morning, Mr. Ambassador. - Morning, Harold. - Morning, sir. What have we got? The people from the Intelsat conference, sir. And the oil consortium at 11, S&P at 12, lunch with Colonel Alan, the senator at 3:30. I've had him for breakfast. Thank you. Say goodbye. I hope it is to say thank you. And don't forget, sir. Later on this afternoon, the demonstration. Oh? Who are we demonstrating against? I'm afraid it's them against us again, sir. Damn! I haven't thrown a rock since I've been here! Some great tennis partner. Good morning, my dear. Good morning, Bob. Come on in. Thank you. [SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING] Our basic policy thrust should be clearly seen by all countries of the Middle East as being positively oriented towards their interests, and not-- underlying not-- merely an attempt to outbid the Soviets in terms of influence. Come in. Hi, Dick. I want to talk to you alone, George. Sure. Type it up so far. Yes, Mr. Harding. Did you tell your man I wanted a transfer? Don't you? That's not the point. I told you I was thinking about it. I said it in strictest confidence. Yes, think it is the point. The morale and the motivation of the staff here are very much the point. The press office gets off to another routine day. Please, advisor's office? Oh, just down the corridor. Can I help you, sir? What I'm saying is you have a choice. Either you're in the system or you're out. There's no middle ground, Dick. Come on, you know that. Oh yeah, the system, just great. System that's given us Cambodia, Vietnam, and all those other goodies, right? That's a pretty damn simplistic attitude, isn't it? You're on the inside. That's where the power is, where you can be effective, get things done. Yeah, change the system. I can do better on the outside, and you know it, George. Crap. You wouldn't exist outside. You'll think you have roots out there. You expect Bobby Seale and Huey Newton to be waiting at Grand Central with a man, and welcome back to the fold, brother Shannon. Come on, George. You would be just one more disillusioned middle class liberal. Spoken like-- I'm sorry, sir. [INAUDIBLE] - What do you want? - You! Well, who are you? I know you. 1967. [INAUDIBLE] What the hell is this? Disarmament conference, committee C. What do you want and what's your name? Gorenko. Senior under Levich. Foreign service [INAUDIBLE]. I wish to ask for political asylum in United States. [PHONE RINGING] Security, Dunniger. On my way. - Trouble? - What else? I'm winning, ain't I? But you're not attached to the Soviet embassy here. No embassy. In Moscow. Well, are you part of a delegation? A visiting party, an official visiting party? Alone! Is it known you're in the country? I do not know. Well, some people-- you must understand. Now, just answer the questions. When did you arrive? Since three hours. It's an odd country to choose, isn't it? If you're going to defect-- why here? You don't understand. I come here-- [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Went to Turkey. The KGB followed him there, and possibly here. Feels he's in danger, and he wants to go to the States. Followed him here to the embassy? Not embassy, airport! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He has important information. They always do. We need an office, no access. I can give you no undertaking of any kind at this time. Do you understand that? Excuse me, Mr. Rylands, it is necessary. You may remain in the embassy as your volition. Your request will be considered. Frank, keep him under wraps. Please. Please. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] George-- He's trouble. I think we should turn him over to the local authorities. He could be a plant. You mean an operation? Who by? Well, the Russians themselves-- to discredit us here. It's possible. Then we turn him out? Hm. Now what about this information he's supposed to have? No, I think we ought to check with Washington first. See if they have anything on him. In the meantime, you and Dick go down and talk to him again. [INAUDIBLE] the cyber-room. We w this stuff through dummy traffic in case someone's listening in. Right. Come on, George. Let's draft this cable. What was the name, again? Gorenko. [TYPEWRITER SOUNDS] Why all this? [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Waste time! I give you my paper. I tell you my name. Mr. Gorenko, you must realize-- [INAUDIBLE]. Who am I speaking with? I'm sorry. I get mad. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] He's got a gun. How do you know? He's sweating like a bull, but he won't take his coat off. Want me to take it? I'll wait. I'd like more details on the information you say you have. I have secret papers on the Russian police here. And other matters important. Where are they? I post them to address in America. What address? No. This is my insurance. Very well, we'll notify you as soon as-- Mister, how is your name? Shannon. I do not lie, Mr. Shannon. I do not lie. I am [INAUDIBLE]. I do not lie. But I tell you-- I ask you, be quick. May I have the gun please? [CHATTER] They're getting ready for tonight, I see. American imperialist out, hands off our oil. Well, gentlemen. No news in Washington, I gather. Not yet, sir. Are [INAUDIBLE] and his people in your office? Yes, sir. Make my apologies, and tell them I'll see them in '10 minutes. In the meantime, gentlemen, we carry on with our business absolutely as usual. And we do have other business, you know. Mr. Ambassador. Yes, George. It's only a matter of time before they find out we're sheltering him. This place is wide open. Anyone can come and go in this embassy, anybody at all. That's right, George. And it's going to stay that way. As they say, this is a free country. Send in Esodean. What you call this? A hamburger with french fries. Typical American food? Yeah, so what? German town and French potato. Well, junior, if it wasn't for you, I'd be home having chicken marinade with my wife, so shut up and eat. [MUSIC PLAYING] Sorry I'm late. Affairs of state? Yes, the ambassador's reception at the residence, tomorrow. It's a big, big problem. Who gets introduced to whom? [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Good day, sir. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Sorry Harold, I'm a-- Postpone my luncheon appointment. Get Shannon. Here you are, George. Washington's accepted him even if you haven't. On your appreciation. They're hedging their bets. If he turns out to be a dud, it's our heads on the block. My head, to be precise. Oh, excuse me sir. Come on in, Dick. Did you get anything? Well, I don't know. He claims to have details on mid 21 disposition and pilot rotations. I know all that. Big deal! Our people will have had that stuff at Fort Meade for weeks. Information. Jesus! - Then he showed me these. Say, do you have a snack bar here? Why? Do you want another hamburger? Oh, no hamburger. Vodka. Bottle of vodka. Vodka? Holy Jesus. It's what he says it is, no question. Standard Soviet cipher. Straddling checkerboard, transposition block. It's a high security transmission code. It squares with his story. Now the before key is one inscriber and three to generate coordinates. And the keys are at his insurance address-- so he says-- with the rest of the papers. In the States, but he won't say where. He'll tell the minute he gets there. All right, we'll use an unmarked car. Dunniger goes with him to the airport. [INAUDIBLE] to the trip. Use plain clothes. Flights, Harold? There's a Middle East Airlines at three, sir. Sir, I must impress upon you-- Get him on it as your travel payment. But don't let them originate here. Now, you were trying to impress something on me, George? This is the point of no recall. We're closing off our options! Please, George. If we lose-- that is, if the operation is blown at the airport or whatever, well, we're dead. We all know that. OK. Let's say we win. We get him out, no trouble. He gets there, spills big. Great. Applause, applause. Medals all around on the White House lawn. But what have we really achieved? I'll tell you. George, look-- none of us are in it for the medals. This embassy is the finest listening post in the whole area. If Gorenko leaves here in that car with Dunniger, if we smuggle him out, all that will go right out the window. I'm afraid that sounds a little abstract to me, George. After all, these embassy is a refuge. A refuge for those who seek freedom. George, look. I got a feeling this is pretty big. What it is, I don't know. But my instinct tells me. And in this case, I'd trust Dick's instinct. Rather than my judgement? After all, Dick isn't an idiot. I don't know. Some of my best friends are idiots. [HORN HONKING] Check the doors! It's locked! These are your travel papers. Be at the airport in 20 minutes. What's happening? Dunniger's on his way. Is that correct? Of course they are. No one will see us. We'll be using the ambassador's private entrance. [PHONE RINGS] Car's here now. It's Phelan. The Swiss ambassador's car is blocking the private entrance. What do we do? We'll use the main door. What has happened? Nothing. Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Quick! Come on, come on. I shouldn't be seen. Just keep moving. Mr. Rylands. Trouble? Could be. That elevator operator has eyes. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Shut up. Come on, no one's going to stop you. Outside-- no, you must force me to come. What the hell are you trying to pull? Excuse me, please. But your wife called! And she says your son is-- Have a minute of fighting outside. This whole thing could be a fake. Get in that car, and don't make one more move, or you'll be out there on your own, you understand? My wife is in Russia, Mr. Shannon. She will suffer if they think I defect. You should have thought of that before. Now there's the car, get in it. [INAUDIBLE]! Hold it! For Christ's sake, Phelan, get him in that car! I got him! See that man over there? Get him in there! Move! I have to think of my wife! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry. What the hell is going on? Had it all set up, didn't you? KGB ran outside, you made us look like a lot of lousy kidnappers. Part of the reason I say. What's it all about? I don't get it. He left his wife in Moscow. So mine's in Nebraska. Who's beefin'? Look straight ahead. What the hell are you trying to do, signal somebody? Is a friend of ours behind? That's no friend of ours. Lose him! Look straight ahead. Take to the airport! [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh hell! [BRAKES SCREECHING] What a mess. They're going to have a reception committee waiting for us when we get to the airport. You know that, don't you? What are we going to do? [CAR PEELING OUT] Mr. Kadish? NAICT coming through now, sir. Washington. Yes, sir. He's a tail, that's for sure. Last known position-- head of M desk. His rapid and secure passage stateside is of utmost importance. Cable urgently your arrangements for implementation, plus his ETA Washington, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Signed assistant secretary of state. Wow. What do you know? We did something right for once, ey? Get the hell off this road and straight back to the embassy! You sure? - My goodness! - Listen, pal. You protest all you want. You go to the airport now, you're going to have everybody waiting for you! The airport police, the army, the Russians, the whole gang. You stupid. You make bad. Relax, will ya? Just think it of as a very delayed takeoff. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Take your [INAUDIBLE] and shove it. Jesus Christ. So now he's back in the embassy? That's right. We switched cars at L building, brought him on the side entrance. I can swear, nobody saw us come in. - Where is he now? - In the barbershop. Where? The barber's not using it for a couple of days, and I thought it was a good place to hide him out. Better go see him. He's bellyaching like hell. We can get him out tonight, can't we? - Sure, sure we can. - Look, Dick, I'm sorry. I know it's a big cock up. But it's the only way I could figure to handle it! All right, quit worrying, Frank. I think you should see this. Yeah, well, what would you like to eat? [PHONE RINGING] Ha! Now you believe me! Yeah, we believe you. Perhaps it is too late now. No, we'll get you out. But first you must help us. I help! I have knowledge. You understand? It is dangerous for me! I understand. But you're safe here. So now you can tell us-- your codes, the addresses you sent them to, and the keys. No! I give you that, I have nothing. You finish with me maybe. I know. OK. Wait, Mr. Shannon. Shannon. Please. I'm afraid. I help. No, no. No codes. No addresses. But I tell you later, OK? How do you say-- I give-- just as-- how do you say? [INAUDIBLE] Tease. Tease! Good. And this concludes first portion of my taped segment on-- China. That's what he says. The current Soviet appreciation. Plus, a detailed operational scenario in the event of Chinese-Soviet hostilities, up to and including sub-nuclear and nuclear missile strikes. I tell you, I don't know a thing. Well, you must know something about it. Look, I'm checking, and I'll let you have whatever I get. What time did he-- Now, will stop yelling and let me-- [INTERPOSING VOICES] Come off it, Jim. [INTERPOSING VOICES] This just came over from the tape. Press statement from the Soviet embassy. Mr. SA Gorenko, age 44, the Leningrad High Institute of Agronomy, telephoned his embassy this morning to confirm that he'd been approached by two agents of the CIA, who tried to force him into a car. But Mr. Gorenko escaped. He was advised to go immediately to the Soviet embassy, but failed to arrive. Mr. Gorenko, who has recently been ill, has now disappeared, and the Soviet embassy has requested the police authorities to help in finding him and, if necessary, securing his release from the American agents. Jesus. Is it true? The ambassador is still in a meeting. I'll let you know. But every newspaper man in town is calling here. You don't know a thing. Sure. I don't even know what agronomy means. That makes two of us. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Can't we simply deny the whole thing? Not after this Russian statement. Well, it doesn't mention us at all. Surely, if they'd seen that struggle outside the embassy, they'd say so. They'd have jumped at it. DICK: Then there's the police. They must have seen him taken out. KADISH: And brought back? Very well. Somebody knows he's been here. I think we can safely assume that. Now, George, will you go to the ministry if they call you? They will. This is what you tell them. A man did come in here. He did claim he was a Russian. He was incoherent and unstable. And a friend of his came here to find him. And between us, we persuaded the man to leave. And that's all we know. I hope they buy it. OK. Now, Dick, it's imperative we get Gorenko out of here. How soon? - This afternoon. Not a chance. We're surrounded by police. - By what? - Protection, sir. The demonstration. Protecting what, I wonder. [PHONE RINGS] Surprise, surprise. Guess who that is? Now, tell Gamble we want background briefing only, not attributable. - Yes he is. Just a moment. It's the foreign ministry, sir. Sheikh Michel. Here we go. What do we do about Gorenko? We can't take him. You'll have to keep him here overnight. George. When you go to the ministry, don't be too rough on them. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] CROWD: Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Goren-- All we know is we helped him to leave. No idea what he wanted or where he went. No, we're not making any official statement. And this is not attributable, Maurice, OK? What? That's fantasy, man. We haven't kidnapped anyone. Sure you can. A firm denial. And a good day to you. Jesus, you can feel the damn thing building up. [SIRENS BLARING] Listen CROWD: Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! Liberate Gorenko! [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Liberate Gorenko. The Russians must have put the word out. Do you think he can hear it? He's in the back. I hope not. I want you have a drink with me. Sit down. Sit down! So American friends don't drink. I drink alone. So where are you going? Reception at the foreign ministry. Chief said everybody should behave as normal as possible. Who's normal? Hey, Dick. Be careful. Oh, thanks, Maisy. [SHOUTING] [WHISTLE TRILLING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [STATELY MUSIC] Nice to see you, Mr. Onassis. How do you do, sir? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Almost didn't make it. I know I am not supposed to ask you, but do you have trouble? You might say that, yes. [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] God damn drunken commie, Caruso. [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] [GORENKO LAUGHING] As soon as we can decently get away from here, I'm taking you out to dinner. You're not serious. I'll miss all this brilliant conversation. You betcha. Come on, throw it to me. Throw me the gun. Keep away. Move around. Well, you're a great help, Sergeant. He's nothing! He's joke! You son of a bitch! [GUNSHOTS] [LAUGHING] Now you come. Only one bullet. One shot. Take this gun. Stop clowning, buster, 'cause I'm not gonna play your god damn games. Now, throw me the gun! One shot. [GUNSHOT] [GORENKO LAUGHING] - Get Shannon. Get him now! It's all right. I'll see you later for dinner, OK? All right, Marine, stay awake. Soon as Mr. Shannon comes out of there, you go in and grab that Russian. OK, Mr. Dunninger. Where are you going? Guess. I'm sorry. I make trouble. I give you trouble. A traitor is not good company, so I drink vodka. It's difficult to be a traitor with dignity. You'll get through it. You are married, Mr. Shannon? No. So it's more difficult to explain, to answer your question why I come here. I have a son. You never have a son. I was married. And I do have a son. Oh. Go on with it. My son is 19 years old. He's 19 year-- 19 year, Mr. Shannon. He thinks he's a poet. He and his idiot friends, all angry, all arrogant, all young. A new movement. They come to my house. They sneer at my generation, at my father's. Like them would understand our sacrifices to make for their good world. Sacrifices. To them, we are cattle too scared to resist Stalin and the secret police. And the-- the war, the war to save one country. We fight to save our lives only, they say. Nothing else. They despise us. But he is my son. Six months ago, they arrest him. Subversion. The trial is secret. 12 years in prison, and labor camp. That is the end of him. 19 years old, poet. 12 years. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] My son. And other things too. I see soon they will dismiss me from the ministry into nothing. Oblivion. All will have been done for nothing. A man must have an affirmation in his life, Mr. Shannon. So I take documents, and I go. And I drink. My wife is a party official, and I tell her nothing. I leave her there. That's why you wanted it to look like a kidnapping. I'm a coward as well as a traitor. And now I'm alone. We'll get you out tomorrow. Get some sleep. Mr. Shannon. You have one cigarette with me before you leave? So I stayed. I don't know why. What's he like? He's a sad kind of guy. He's funny though. You like him? Yeah, I like him. Yeah. He's got this kid in one of these labor camps and-- LAURE: And what's that got to do with you? Well, he thinks my pappy and mammy spent their youth picking cotton down in the Delta. I mean, that's what he thinks. That's what he reads in his paper back home, and he's never been to the States. And you let him believe it? Oh, what could I say? Come straight out and tell him that my father is an associate professor of Slavonic languages at UCLA? Richard Shannon, I love you. (SINGING) Tote that barge, lift that bale. [GIGGLING] You want the commercial attache? Yes, miss. It's to your right, and right again. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. Do you have a map of Saudi Arabia I can look at? RECEPTIONIST: Yes, it's in the library. You go straight through here. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Kadish. KADISH: Good morning. How are the answers? KADISH: Thriving. Good morning, Colonel. Colonel Kesten. I'm looking for one of my officers. Said he'd be with the air attache. Yes, first floor. Elevator there. Thank you, honey. Good morning, Colonel. Good morning, Sergeant. Good morning, Colonel. Yes, it is quite a good morning. [WHISTLING] Can I help you? I guess I'm lost. I thought there was a men's room around here someplace. End of the corridor, turn right. Thanks. No patients? Be my guest any time, Colonel. [KNOCKING] Good morning, Steve. Good morning, sir. Is this the room, Marine? Sir? Where they're keeping the man. Your name, please, sir, Colonel. Kesten. Is Mr. Shannon in there? Identity papers, please, sir. Sorry. Guess I am in a bit of a hurry. Where are you from, Mr. Shannon? Peoria. Peoria, Illinois. [DOOR BANGS] [GUNSHOTS] [GRUNTING] [GUNSHOT] [YELLING] [GUNSHOT] He got Gorenko. How in God's name did he get in here? Seems he just walked in. Where is he now? Under guard in the basement. Well, where did he come from? Who is he? Nobody seems to know, sir. [SIGHS] You a Russian, Kesten? [LAUGHING] Come on, give me your real name. Kesten doesn't sound American to me. Kesten. Colonel, United States Air Force 19th Aviation Battalion. Can Tho, Vietnam. How's that sound, hmm? Boy, we had a time out there, I tell you. Flying choppers, you know, gunships. Action, zowee! Oh-ho! I tell you, there's nothing like it. Sitting up there in your ol' UA hog, right on top of them. All six machine guns just hammering away all at the same time. Brr-ra-ta! Brr-ra-ta-ta-ta! And all them little yellow mothers just running, and you're laughing, and your 762s are just brr-ra-ta, and brr-ta, brr-ta, shredding them up like coleslaw. Shut up! And some kid's entrails are hanging out all the way. And boy, he just keeps running like he's going to break the-- Shut up, you murdering son of a bitch! Well, doesn't that sound American to you? DICK: How is he? His pulse is a bit stronger, and I've stopped the bleeding, but I can't continue to accept the responsibility, Mr. Shannon. We'll get a doctor as soon as we can. Miss Harding, there'll be a marine guard in here with you, the one outside. No one's to come in without my authorization. We're afraid you mustn't leave until I say so. If there's anything you need, let me know. He's cool, that Shannon. Anything we need. We need a doctor is what we need. [GORENKO COUGHING] "This embassy is also a refuge," your exact words. So now we have in the building one murdered local employ, one psychopath KGB killer, and one illegal defector. Some refuge. As soon as Gorenko's on his way to Washington, we turn Kesten loose and report the incident to the proper authorities. Gorenko's badly hurt. I don't think we can move him out for days, weeks even. We're going to operate on him as soon as possible. I already wired Izmir for an army doctor. Then we'll know how soon. I'm not talking politics now, Mr. Ambassador. A crime has been committed in this embassy. A guy has been shot. He's dead, an Arab, and we're covering up. How many local employees know about this? Dozens. Dozens of them heard the shooting. It'll be all over town tonight. And we'll have the cops on us. So? So they'll want the body and the guy who did it, Kesten. And you give them Kesten, you'll have to give them Gorenko. Why? GEORGE: Because Kesten knows Gorenko's here. He'll blow the whole thing wide open. Then what do you suggest? We hand them over now. Gorenko, everybody. Out of the question. I received my instructions from Washington, and I'm carrying them out. Listen, Gorenko may die. So then what? We bring the cops and say, oh, sorry. We forgot to tell you. We've just been sweeping out our closets and we found these two dead guys. Yeah. One's a Russian, the other's one of your people. Seems they both tripped over something and fell on these bullets. All right, George, all right. If you can't come up with anything more constructive than that, forget it. I've made my decision. Will you listen to me! I have been listening, George. Most of my job is listening. And there comes a time when you must stop listening and make decisions. Well, I've made mine. All right, then. I just want to put on record that I disassociate myself completely from this whole cockeyed scheme. I want that on the record officially. Very well. Consider yourself suspended from your duties for an indefinite period. Then you will be in the clear, won't you? Well, if they don't get that bullet out, the man's gonna die. Miss Hardy said it's not a difficult operation necessarily, but they gotta do it right away. God damn! There's no American military here. I daren't risk taking a civilian. I know someone, sir. I know. That thought had gone through my mind too. What do you think of Laure? What do you mean? I mean can you trust her? Of course I trust her. Then you better talk to her as soon as we get back. [CHATTER] There's been no kidnapping. That's official. The ambassador's visiting a foreign minister. That's all I have to say. GROUP: Aw! [ARABIC CALL TO PRAYER] Oh, yes, there's one other thing before you go in, sir. Harold told me that the police are on to us about Fujed. - Fujed? - The man who was killed. I see. What do they know? I don't think they know anything. It's just that the man usually goes home for lunch. When he didn't show up, his wife called them, and they called personnel. Did Price say anything? No, he just said he'd check. But I think they're on to something. Why? Well, Price said a few of the local staff didn't show up at the lunch, and some of them were late. Apparently the police have been interrogating them. I see. Well, Dick, wait for me, will you? Sir. Good luck. Thanks. MARINE: Hey, Keveney. Open up. [INAUDIBLE] Did Dunninger OK it? MARINE: He's been pissing on the floor, for Christ's sakes. What the hell. Hold it. Move it. [YELLING] You murdering bastard! KESTEN: Get back or I'll kill him. MARINE: Take it easy! He's got my gun! Come out of there, Kesten. KESTEN: You get out. All the way. What the hell did you let him come in here for? He had the whole god damn thing planned. He was pissing on the floor. I'm gonna piss on you, Marine, from a great god damn height. Believe me. [GUNSHOT] Move! [GUNSHOT] [GLASS SHATTERING] That's the last time he goes to the head. From now on, [INAUDIBLE]. He'll just throw it all over. That's your problem, Marine, not mine. Come on, help him. Move! Move! [HONKING] [CHATTER] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] OK, it was murder at the ministry. And I say we've had a frank exchange of views. That's routine, but the rest of it isn't. It can't go on like this, Dick. They're hemming us in out there, questioning tourists, and now they've got pictures of what they say is the kidnapping. Where the hell did they get this? Well, Jesus, I don't know. Telephoto lens, I guess. And for a topper, you tell me about Kesten, and poor Fujed being killed. Just so you can block questions if you're asked. Asked? They're like a pack of wolves. What do I say? Nothing. If you've got nothing to say-- Don't say it at length. I know. [PHONE RINGS] Shannon. Be right down. You understand no one must know why you're here. You said a man was dying. That's why I'm here. Laure. We've got to get him out tonight. Miss Harding, this is the doctor. Please give her every assistance. [INAUDIBLE] Thank you, Miss Harding. No x-rays, and hardly any time. When did you last give an anesthetic, Miss Harding? About six months ago, I'm afraid. You are ahead of me. I haven't performed an abdominal operation since medical school. Well? Shall we help each other? Guess we'll have to, doctor. You want it straight, Mr. Shannon? As a plan, it stinks. Can you think of a better one? No. That's it. Yeah, but I can't see that Kesten bastard cooperating. He will, if he's unconscious at the time. Oh, uh, Mr. Shannon. Uh-huh? It'd be my pleasure to take care of that for you. DICK: Frank, you got it. This too tight? No, thank you. I can't say I pretend to like this, Dick. But I've told the minister, and if anything goes wrong-- Well, sir, if you like-- I've been on of the State Department about getting a plane. I'm trying to get a Navy jet, probably out of Crete. How many cars do you need? We'll need four. One decoy, and three. Drivers? Taken care of. Good. And I won't see you at the reception. Oh, I forgot about that. I wish I could. In other words, we have to make the best of our party, is that right? If this thing blows up, you'll be joining me anyway at a guillotine party. Well, as the aristocrat said, the program was lousy, but the company's good. Right. Well, good luck . Thanks a lot. Let's go, Frank. Now, how many people did you say are left at the embassy? Eight. Blood pressure? Blood is OK? 110. How is he? Why is he up like that? It's better for his breathing to be sitting up. The bullet's been removed. He had two small perforations to the intestines. There's sewn up. Now there's a good chance he'll heal if he's kept still. Then he's all right. He shouldn't be moved. He shouldn't be moved at all. Goodnight. Goodnight. I need every Marine I can get, and I want them here tonight. But it's the 4th of July-- I know the god damn date! I guess you're kind of edgy this evening, sir. You're the kind of Marine that thought the Japs were crop-dusting at Pearl Harbor. Hi, Frank. Hi. Just came through from Washington. Jesus, that was quick. Voice communication. Send him throuh Rome's KY9, and on to us Hell, it's a story. Well, we're in business. We're getting a military jet, and some top-ranking State Department guy coming along for the ride. Or they try and pump the poor bastard on the way home, I guess. There's no chance. Well, that's their problem. How's your end? Well, Phelan's on his way to the pickup point, hired car. He's going to call when he gets there. A decoy car? FRANK: Well, [INAUDIBLE] at 7:00. All we can do is wait. [CHATTER] [COUGHING] How are you? Can you hear me? [HACKING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [PHONE RINGS] I got it. Dunninger. Yeah. All right. All right! It's Phelan. He's in position with the car. It's time. I'm going up to Gorenko. And I'll take care of Kesten. [HACKING] Keveney. Hey, Keveney. If he don't get up, he's going to kill himself. Call Dunninger. He's with Shannon. OK. Cool it, Marine. He doesn't answer. For Christ's sakes. I'll cover you. [GROANING] Careful. Nobody comes through those doors tonight. Do you hear me good? They're locked. Even so, keep an eye on 'em. Yes, sir. [HACKING] Move! KESTEN: Drop the gun. Drop it! [GUN CLANGS ON FLOOR] Kick it over. [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS] Take him down the elevator straight to the car outside the ambassador's entrance, then change into your civilian clothes. Got it? Yes, sir. [GROANING] HARDING: Hold him steady. Wait here till it's clear, then I'll come back and pick you up. I'm going with you, Richard. Laure. You can't. It's too dangerous. - I must! What if he starts to bleed? [PHONE RINGING] Shannon. God damnit! OK, I'm coming right down. Stay here and lock the door, and don't open it until I come back! - But Richard-- Listen to what I say! - Blast that door open! - Oh, hell. Go on. You, Marine, move, move! [GUNSHOT] Kesten's escaped. Shoot him on sight. Tell the others. Check the fire exit. If they get to the top, they can get out. [GUNSHOT] Where is he? Where is he? I don't know. Yes, you do. I don't. You know, lady. You know, all right. [GASPS] And you're gonna tell me. Come on, hurry it up. Come on, Marines, god damn it. Move! Move! Move! Good luck. KEVENEY: Kesten's got the girl! What? Somewhere in [INAUDIBLE],, and Shannon's after him. You two stay here. Come on, move! [APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. BETTY (ON PHONE): Switchboard. Can I help you? It's Shannon. Why are you calling this line? BETTY (ON PHONE): You were flashing me, sir. Betty, someone was flashing you from this line? BETTY (ON PHONE): Yes, Mr. Shannon. Do you know who it was? BETTY (ON PHONE): No, sir. Somebody just picked up the receiver and put it down again. I've been calling through as you answered. Oh, just a moment, sir. Betty-- for Christ's sake. BETTY (ON PHONE): Hello? Sorry, Mr. Shannon, I had a flash from 250, sir, but there was no caller. Where's 250? BETTY (ON PHONE): No, I don't know exactly. I haven't got a building plan. All I have is a name list. It must be the third floor. They're trying to get an outside line. BETTY (ON PHONE): What's that, sir? Betty, listen. I'm on my way down. Now, watch those flashes and remember where they came from. And don't take any more calls, understand? BETTY (ON PHONE): Yes, sir. He's on the third floor, somewhere near 250. He's got the doctor with him. Now he just tried 240. That's Mr. Wollinsky's office. He must be coming back. Call 250, quick. [BUZZING] Keveney. Sergeant. He's somewhere near 240. Get over there quick. We're on our way up, OK? Any luck? Located him on second. Trying to get an outside line. All he has to do is dial 17. That's the police. We'll be invaded. [BUZZING] 191. Go ahead. Switchboard. Can I help you? He's hung up. - Where is he now? - First floor. That's near Rylands' office. He can get an outside line from there. Call 240. Wait. Will Kesten hear it? I can give a short ring. Go ahead. [BUZZING] He's gone. Let's go. Come on. LAURE: Richard. Drop the gun. [GUN CLANGS ON FLOOR] All right, diplomat. Move. [SIREN BLARING] [GUNSHOTS] Kesten! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [BUZZING] Go! [HONKING] Second car, go! [HONKING] [WHISTLES TRILLING] [CHATTER] Who is this man? He's unconscious. He's the Russian, Gorenko, isn't he? They've drugged him, sir. You, get back in the car. You drive it. Who are you? I'm a member of this embassy. My name is Shannon. I have diplomatic status here, and I demand to know why you stopped this car. You demand it, sir? This is our soil here! How dare you try such a trick! Sending that car out to draw us away, and then attempting to smuggle this man out illegally! They were taking him to police headquarters. Oh-ho! So you are taking him to police headquarters, eh? If you're going interrogate this man, I insist on being present, alone with my embassy colleagues. There'll be plenty of high-level trouble if we're not there. There are other members of the embassy in that car. Very well. This is the man that concerns me. And everyone would like to smuggle him out illegally. Don't try to ask him any questions till we're all there. Let's go. [SIRENS BLARING] Keep up with them. I'll tell you when to slow down. I hope [INAUDIBLE] still there. All right, start dropping back. Take this turn here, quick. Turn right in here. Make a left. Make a left. Where is the other car? Could have taken a wrong turn. Officer, dark blue American embassy car. Send out an APB. But they're diplomats, sir. We are trying to help them. They want to come here. Now, inside. [SIRENS BLARING] You're on your way to America, friend. Oh, friend. [SIRENS BLARING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] This man is Gorenko. Senyen Andreyevich Gorenko. You'd better ask him. Where are his papers? Do you have them? No, we don't. I would remind you kidnapping in this country is a serious matter. And as commissioner for this district, it is my duty to investigate it. And I intend to do so. I must remind you, Commissioner, that as members of the United States Embassy, we came in here voluntarily, and cannot accept any police restraint. Who is this man? He came in the embassy this morning, and subsequently killed a local member of the staff. If this is true, why didn't you report it sooner? The embassy always reports to Washington first. They are feeding you a bunch of lies! The embassy is open for your inspection, Commissioner. What were you doing there? Who are you? Let's just say I was collecting my visa for the States. Where are we going, Dick? Airport. You think he got on the plane all right? I don't know. Main thing is they made it. Frank, you got the day off tomorrow. Oh, Dick, are you a betting man? - Yeah. - I'll make you a bet. When I get home, my wife says, you get up early tomorrow morning and take the kids to school. If she says that, I'm gonna belt her. $10? $10. Hey. Laure, you were great. Richard, this is Mr. Gilbert. Hi, Mr. Shannon. Clem Gilbert, State Department. Oh, yes, I heard you were coming down. How's everything in Washington? Laure, what are you doing? He's supposed to be on the plane already. Come on-- He's not going. What do you mean he's not going? There's been a change of program. What kind of change? [SIRENS BLARING] You set this up. It was all set. They know what we went through to get this man out of here. And all of a sudden-- Richard, help me with him. We made, let's say, an independent assessment of the situation. Assessment? This man's a political refugee. We gave him asylum. We made a commitment to him! Will you [INAUDIBLE] stop squabbling over him as though he was a piece of paper or something and get him into the ambulance so that I can at least try and keep him alive. Now! [MUSIC - BIDDU, "SOMEBODY'S GOT TO STOP THIS MADNESS"] Brothers across the sea never have food to eat. While we rape Mother Earth, there's no clean air to breathe. Politicians never lie, and truth they never see. Hey. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Somebody's got to stop this madness and put an end to our own blindness. Yeah. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Beautiful world, I've come to say goodbye. What they're doing to you makes me wanna cry. DICK: We made a commitment to him! GILBERT: We felt that, given the exceptionally delicate context of the political situation in this area, that we should avoid any action which could be construed as provocative, either by friendly elements or hostile. And this, in fact, was our overriding factor in our making this decision. ANNOUNCER (ON LOUDSPEAKER): This is the final call for passengers of flight C8102 for Rome, Paris, and New York, with immediate connection for Washington. This flight is now boarding at gate number 7. A final call for passengers for flight C8102. BIDDU: Beautiful world, I've come to say goodbye. What they're doing to you makes me wanna cry. Somebody let me out. All I wanna be is free. Too many men up top telling me what to be. Everybody talks about peace, but war is all we see. Hey. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Somebody's got to stop this madness and put an end to our own blindness. Yeah. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Stop it right now. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Do it somehow. Somebody's got to stop this madness. Yeah, yeah. Somebody's got to stop this madness.
