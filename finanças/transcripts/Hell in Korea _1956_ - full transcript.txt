At 0600 hours on may the 10th, a patrol consisting of one officer and 15 other ranks left B company forward positions with orders to establish whether a village at map reference 638, 742 was occupied by the enemy. They crossed a wide area of open country and the morning was uneventful. By 1300 hours they were nearing their objective. Sarge Payne? Sarge Payne! Don't stray now, and stop that everlasting jabber of yours. Did dead men talk? Big head. Wyatt, get off that wireless pack. You sicken me Wyatt. Why do you always look so bloody miserable? Don't you... like it here? He's thinking out his football pools corporal. Less of your lip Matthews. I didn't say anything corporal. Then say something. Say you'll be a credit to us. Because if you're not, you'll have my... boot on your neck. There's the village. Looks abandoned. Best thing to do with it sir. You can smell it through the binoculars. It was home to some poor gooks. Well it's no man's now. Anyway it's the limit of the patrol. Can't say I'm sorry sir, but this rule that... What a climate sir, treats me terrible. What a country to fight about. Look at the soil. Muck, dead as old bones. Take a look at that hill beyond the village. That jolly looking building must be a temple. Can't say it's my idea of a church sir. But then your proper line is architecture ain't it sir? That's it Sarge. Whistle up the Korean. Kim! Now what's cooking? Think I'll go home. Not without you plugged your ration of the chinks Jackie. It's what you withstood this lovely trip for. No it wasn't Lindy boy. I'm different from you schnorris. I'm a man of means. I said to the colonel sir, I said, Waving your cheque book. waving me cheque book. I've got the wonder back. I'll take along with you, but independent like. I mean I've got to keep an open mind. So they give me a watch brief. I'm a government agent. You can keep it, give me a pop at a chink. We're not here to pop the chinks, we're here to convert them. You've had the wrong training Private Matthews. Where's your education? Is that all the welfare state's done for you? We don't fight wars no more with bullets. We fight with ideas. You're daft Jackie. Private Docker, I'm the sanest man in Korea. I don't want a dead chink on my conscience. Visa versa, I don't want a dead Rabin on any chinks. Fair's fair. I'm a compassionate human animal. Private Wyatt! Wyatt? Why don't you leave him alone? Why? Signal in on my command. 249 Private Rabin is a compassionate human animal. Taken prisoner is to be treated according to Geneva rules. It is especially requested he has morning tea in bed. And a Slant-eyed little darling to share it. Just one idea in his head. It's a good idea. Is that temple for Buddha? Oh yes sir, that hill not half holy. Is that why the Chinese aren't sitting on it? No sir, holy for Koreans, not for them chink commies. Well then why haven't they occupied it? If you cut off sir, that hill no ruddy good. Okay this side, other side no can go. Alright thanks Kim. Hadn't we better get going sir? I'd hate to meet a lot of chinks in the dark, with our bunch of boy scouts. The boy scouting command eh? Oh no sir, I wasn't inferring your national service. Okay Sarge, but get them cracking. Just check on the village and then trot home. Alright, get cracking. Get at the top. Lieutenant Butler! There's a couple of gooks still here sir. Watch it, search them. Coming on up sir. Alright take them inside. Kim, come. Private! Sir Stay by the door. Ask them what they're doing here. These gooks have another village. Now they come back for kids. Have you seen any enemy troops? Do they know where the Chinese are now? The north. How far north? Just north sir. Low class gooks sir. Nothing up top. They're not, if you ask me sir. What will they do if the Chinese come to their present village? They help us again sir. They don't like any soldier. They want to be left alone. Alright Sarge Payne, let them go. Come, Charlie come. Yes sir, yes sir. Charlie come, let's go. Let's go. Emchee! Hodge! Sir. What was that in aid of? I'm sorry sir. They proper annoy me sir. No respect for the uniform. Rest here, 20 minutes. We'll eat. Oh, and search the huts. Wyatt, get two of the lads and search the huts. Get on with your rations. Hey Matthews, Sims. What couldn't I do to a brewery? Ah lay off will you. We'd be doing the Koreans a favor if we burnt this stinking lot down. I've seen some slums in Poplar but in my life I've never seen anything like this. These flies are man-eaters. They won't worry you then will they? Matthews! Give me that. Who is it Matthews? Not Matthews! That's enough of that Wyatt. Stand clear all of you. Move yourselves. I'll see to it sir. Right. That field will do beyond the huts. Alright Cooper, you see them. O'Brien, you've this sort of thing before. Any volunteers? I will sir. Alright, move yourself. Rest of you, get your rations. Bad luck sir. My first casualty. My fault. I should have expected it. What about me? With my experience? Fond of reading arn't you sir. Thank you. Whistle up the lookouts. When they've finished we'll cool off. Right sir. What's the time in London now? Morning. Night. Night? Yeah, Tim Pipp, Emma. Hey Wyatt. What? Tune us in to Sonny Goode. Get us the night programme. They're feeling better. Listen to them sir. Real witless. Talks a great relief you know, Sarge Payne. Not there silly jabber sir. Go on Wyatt, tune us into the big fight. This the one? Tonight? Yeah, Tarzan the chink and batting him wild. My money's on the chink. When the yellow men get Wyatt they'll have his guts for garters. He'll look worse than Matthews. Ah, Wyatt. Don't like my conversation. Not do I then about Matthews. Get out, I'd like a tenner for every man I've seen blown to bits. There's only a decent bloke in this rotten bunch. Ah, get in. Stick your neck out don't you mate. I'll say what I like. Save your breath for marching. Got a long way to go. Not our lucky day. And us on the last lap. How many of them sir? Can't really tell. Judging by the dust, about two platoons in each column. Hold them there Sarge Payne Hold it there lads. Here you go Ryker. Remainder get down and rest. But keep your packs on. What's happened Sarge? A cow on the line. Chinks? The way they're coming they'll cut us off. Stay with them. This is what you were expecting all along isn't it? Yeah. What do you want to do sir? Well you see that mound. It's one of their burial places. I want to leave a covering party there, draw the enemy fire. The rest slip around the right flank. How about that? Fair enough sir. How many to stay? Four. Well we can't spare more. Oh, you better get the best men with the Bren. O'Brien, Rabin, and Lance Corporal Hodge, I'd rather stay with him myself sir. Not Corporal Ryker. I'll go and tell them sir. Corporal Ryker. See that tree behind you? Yes sir. Take two men and lop a half a dozen branches off. Sir? Make them longish. Very good sir. They picked me for an hero. Coach your luck mate. You can have it. Never mind Jackie, when you come back the medals you'll get will make more noise than Billy Cotton's band. I'll come back. You should live so long. Here, how are you office now? I think so, I'll go to the pictures. Cop these. You're so generous. Gives me everything except the wreath. We're going to have a whip round for that mate. I reckon it'll take all of three hours to get round that hill. Yes, we'll have to hold that man for at least two. We'll do our best sir. We'll put up a show sir. Are you taking a Bren sir? Sarge Payne. You take the patrol back, I'm staying here. It ain't your job sir. I know, but I'm staying. O'Brien's the only one who's seen action. We must all start sometime. You haven't seen action yet sir. Now we'll put that right. Now off you go. Move fast and keep the dust down. Yes sir. And Sarge Payne. Service with a smile. O'Brien. Fall in now. Right, just drop them there. Come on, let's have you. Would you rather stay? I'd rather come with you, Sarge. Pick up the stuff. Bring us back a small Terryin, Rabin. What about you pig, schlemiel? What are we then, burning wood? Not far wrong, Rabin. That's Dunsinane. Good luck, sir. Thank you, Sarge Payne. All right, keep down. Right, here we go. It's worked. They've gone to ground. They think we're a whole battalion. How long before they come to find we ain't? Won't take them long son. All right, come on up. Get that gun as quickly as you can, O'Brien. Yes, sir. What's this we're on? What do you think? I don't want to be taken by yellow men. Taken, it says. Where do you think they're going to take us? They've got the graves all laid on, ready. Don't worry, we'll have them. All right, ready, sir. There you are, mate. All right to smoke, sir. Thanks. Have one, sir? Not now, thanks, Rabin. Do you know why Docker give me these? He thinks he left the right to tell my mother that I've copped it. And Docker can't write. Get me? Proper jazz session, isn't it? All right, judge your own range. Don't fire until I tell you. Hodge, take the left. Sir. Brian, the center. Took. Rabin, the right. Yes, sir. Wait for it. All right, then. Fire! I've got one! Single shot. Cease fire! Well, we certainly did have them. Just a touch. They seem to want to die. As soon as the bugles blow, they go looking for it. Then again we've done pretty well. Sir. I reckon if we do hold them off a couple of hours, we'll have a chance to get away? Well, I'd rather be us than them. Rabin, Now I'll have that fag, if I may. Well, I know one thing. I'll have to be something different when I get back home. You can be. Dead. That's that different. Have you got any ambitions? Take them in the next few minutes. Ah, you'll talk yourself into anything. Anyway, what was your civvy job? I was a valet in a hotel. I used to clean the boots and press the trousers... Thanks. Why didn't you tell them when they called you up? You could have been valet to a general. Safe as a bug in a rug. Maybe the generals was all fixed up. So you're not so particular. You'd have settled for a brigadier and sat out the war pressing his pants. I want to be a farmer. Right, old dreamer, you are. I like to watch things grow. Lucky if you watch yourself grow. I like to shoe a horse. You know, when I was a boy, I used to watch our village smith. Here, let me do that, Jackie. You'll mess this up. You'll get us into trouble, you know. I used to poke my head over the half door and I'd... I think there's nothing so grand as hammering hot iron. All red and soft-like. Beating it with a nice swinging hammer, all sparky, then shaping it. Then pumping it up with the bellows again. I thought one day I'll do that. But I left the village before I grew up. And for this. He was on velvet already, so he leaves it for this. Hodge and O'Brien take the left. Rabin cover the right with me. Short bursts, wait until you see a target. Fire! Jammed. It's jammed. It's jammed! Regulator! Aah! Aah! Aah! Cease fire! Look out! Grenade! Aah! I told Sarge Payne I'd give him two hours. And half hour to go and only three of us. There's some more magazines left, sir. We've got evers. All right. Bury him down there before they come on again. And take off his identities. Oh, yes, sir. Empty his pockets. What on earth are you doing here? Couldn't make it, sir. Why not? Another column come round from the west. Cut it off. I'll lot he had family. I never talked to him much before, but stuck out here together. I wish I hadn't made that crack. What crack? That about him being dead, that's our difference. Come on, boy, get on with it. I sent the patrol back to the village, sir. Right. We've got an hour before dark. We'll go back there and slip away then. Your lot certainly did your bit here. We lost Hodge. On your feet now, lads. We need to move on. I've done enough moving off today and getting nowhere. Yeah, nice waste our little effort was. Ah, don't come that battle-scarred veteran stuff with us. Tell us more about Hodgie. So what about Hodgie then? He was alive one minute and dead the next, wasn't he? Good for a laugh that is, isn't it? Take it easy, mate. Yeah, you're right. I've got to snap out of it. I'm afraid it isn't any better, sir. The atmospherics are terrible. Nightjaw, nightjaw, sunray here. My position is 638,742. I'm surrounded area hill 17, enemy troops. We'll try a breakout under cover of dark. Over. Hello, nightjaw, nightjaw, sunray here. Sunray here, My position is 638,742. Over. Oh, pack it up. It's no good they're not receiving us. We can try later from higher ground, sir. That's the set's UF, sir. What makes you think that? Well, you got rather a bashing. Yes, I saw it. Well, I couldn't help it. I tripped. Sir! Sir, Chinese pretty damn close, sir. I've seen scouts there and there. I think they get all around village and... I'll go and pick Bren's positions. We can't stand up against the whole battalion. We have to get away up the hill. Kim says there's no way down the other side. They'll have us on a plate, sir. If we get away before they contact us, they won't even know we're there. Pick two men and give us covering fire while we get away. Come on, Wyatt, come on. Keep out of sight and don't fire unless you have to. Right, sir. Well, get outside Wyatt. Kim. I should need you in front as a guide. Is there a trap? Big part of temple, sir? Full of men? Well, don't join it until we've left the village. Find a way through the trees. Well, off you go. Get a moving Sarge Payne. Get a moving. Come on, get on with it. Move! Move! Bring it in. Looks like Sergeant Payne's in trouble. You take the patrol on up. I'm going back. Hiya. Come on. More innings, mate. There's witches in these woods. Big yellow Chinese ones. Are they even ponderous? Or am I psychic? Yeah, you're the most psychic man in Korea. Well, do us a favour. Keep the wolfy tail from breathing down me neck. Go on, mate. Oh, Sarge Payne. Well done. We got through without being spotted sir. Jolly good. Corporal Ryker. Sir. Get a moving at the back. Come on, you lot. Do you want me to carry you? Go on. Come on. All right, mate? Yeah, yeah, I'm all right. Good. Come on. Wyatt don't approve of getting wet. Better be wet than dead. I don't know. Drowning's a quick death. I don't want a quick death. I want a long one. I want one the last till I'm 90. Funny the things you want when you know you can't have em. I've never been to the British museum. I'd like to go there. I'd like to shut the big doors and make sure no gooks get in. Or witches. I'd like to go to the White City and put a quid on a dog. I'd like to be on Southend beach in a big deck chair chewing half a yard of rock. That's just about what you'll get on this hill, with you underneath it buried in three feet of earth. Fooled you. I'm going to be cremated. It's in me country. What's so special about being cremated, Jackie? Well, it's hygienic. Fat lot you'd care then. I'm a very fastidious man. I didn't see my contract about my monument. What monument's that there, Jackie? My monument. It's to read very simple. Like this. "Jackie Rabin, the immortal soldier. Died avoiding action." "Unwashed and undefeated, profane in victory, last up in retreat." It'd be a pretty big monument, mate. Well, I'm a pretty big man. Would the immortal soldier mind using his feet for that old immortal purpose? Yes, sir. Where's the wireless? Oh, strap's broke, sir. You've ditched it. No, sir. It slipped down hill, sir. How far back is it? Come on, tell me. It fell down hill, sir. Do you know what you've done? Told you the set was UF when we finished anyhow. Get up. Go on, get up. That was a shotty. Should be easy going up to the top now, sir. Is the temple still in use? No sir. All the men all scatter, sir. We'll go up then. Get some sleep. If the chinks aren't bedded down there already, sir. Sir, sir. The Chinese, sir. Take cover. Scatter. Kim, tell Corporal Ryker not to fire unless we're spotted. Lieutenant says not to fire unless we are spotted. All right, all right. Tell the rest. Henson, keep down. (Speaking foreign language) (Speaking foreign language) Aaah! Stand up, O'Brien. Look here. Get him off the path. Ryker, Kim. How do you feel? I don't know. Don't hurt much. Feel sort of numb, like I had a kick. Henson, dressing. Sorry about this, sir. Come on, you fellows. That wound don't look much, sir. Very little bleeding. Get the dead chinks off the path. I have, sir. Reckon those ponies will blow the gas flow, sir. Thanks. I'll be able to walk, sir. Just aches a bit. Not far to the top. I'll make it, sir. No bleeding's a good sign, isn't it, sir? Yes, very. Wyatt! Tom Payne, get'em moving. All right, get fell'n now. Careful, careful. All right, put your weight on him. I'd rather not, sir. Nonsense. He's got nothing else to carry now. I know about first aid. The army gets you around some horrible places, don't it? Guard the gate, corporal. I can take Kim with you. All right. Take your packs off. Get down. Relax. I see you made it. I couldn't have done it by myself. Go and get the Red Cross pack from Henson. How's that? Better get you up, then. Hey, what about his kit? How do you feel? All right, sir. Considering, you know. You'd better take this over. Don't drop it down the hill. Here you are. Take two of these. It'll give you a good sleep. Thank you, sir. Just what I need. Don't leave him. I brought your kit, mate. Thank you. Had his cup... Blimey. You're under a goal lime. Look. Stop cuddling it. Bust it and shove it in your sock. Whose blister is it? Why don't you give it to a museum? Call Kim and we'll guard on the roof. Call Kim. We'll leave Ryker at the gate. All right. Butler's got butterflies in his trousers. He's just a bundle of nerves. I'd be a bundle of nerves if I was him. First he gets Matthews blown up. Then he marches into the whole chink army and we lose Hodgie. Then he tries to get us roasted alive. Then he takes us a nice walk up a mountain. What don't lead nowhere. Now he's fix'n it first to nick down a precipice. Not on your Nelly, boy. I'm a regular soldier. I didn't sign on as a Guinea pig for kids to muck up out with. Stop your big yap! He's doing the best he can for us, ain't he? That's right, Sonny boy. You stick up for him. You're two of a kind, you are. Bloody amateurs. Come on, Moonie. Moonie! - enough. Moonie! - Ain't we got enough trouble? You ought to know better, Moon. Oh, we were just working off our superfluous energy. Now, sir, what you want is a couple of slit trenches halfway up the slope with Brens in them backed up by the other two Brens at the end of the courtyard. The scrub hacked down between us and the trees. We'll do it now. Yes, sir. I won't be very popular with the men, eh? They must think I've made a pretty good cock of everything. Don't you worry, sir. You're young and you ain't a veteran, but you've kept your head. And used it. It's a fine lining moon they got here. Ah, useless thing. Big pot-bellied shining thing, gawping at you as if he was naked. Not like a decent English moon. We're glad to see one of them again, sir. You think we owe a shell, sir? Neither do I. Well, that's not something we'll discuss with the men. They can smell a bad egg without tasting it. They're a good lot. Ah, city types. When you get the frills off on them, they're as good as any. Except one. We know how one piece of rot can spread. Throw the wireless away, would you? So we... can't tell them we're still alive. I'm going to get you, Wyatt. When the chinks start on us again, and you turn... yellow on us. I'll be behind you, Wyatt. Now get them on their feet. On your feet now. You've had a lovely rest. Get your boots on. We're going to do a nice little bit of digging and this and that. Come on, on your feet. Not you, Kim. Blimey, we'll be breathing in this and that in a minute. Your not paid to breathe. Your paid to fight. Sarge Payne? Sir. I'd like to talk to them first. Very good, sir. Right, gather around. Sit down. I've no medals for you, not even for Rabin. But it's been a tough patrol and you've done well. We all know we had to come out and get information about the enemy. But we've got it. All we've got to do now is to get it back. We're getting short of food, so Sarge Payne will look after your rations. We're also getting short of ammo. Don't waste it. I'm sending Kim off at crack of dawn to find a back way out of here. Meanwhile, we've got to stick it. Understand? Right, any questions? Sir, how long do we make the ammo last? Till we're dead, bonehead. Ask silly questions, you get silly answers. Corporal Ryker, you and Moon get up there on top and lookout. Do the first stack. The rest of you out there in front. Now, the sooner the job's done, the sooner I'll be tucking you up and bye-bye. So jump to it! Right, Moon. Sir. Well? Sims, sir. He talked to me all of a sudden, like I was his Dad. What about his football pools? Come on Dad, is it boatin for draw. Then he started coughing blood. So I trimmed him up. All is passing. Nothing persists in life, but life. The flower doesn't smell less sweet, 'cause one day it will wither. I've got no right to send him out as young as him. You're not worried about Sims, you're worried about yourself. What if I am? Why wouldn't I be? I didn't want the army, I didn't want to come out here and never ask for any of it. I had a good job and I've a girl and I lived decent. I wasn't any trouble to no one. Well, you are now. You're the nastiest bit of trouble that could be wished on us. Do you know why the men hate you, Wyatt? Because they're all rotten. They come from rotten homes and had rotten lives and they was glad to get out of it. I don't mind all this filth and stink and hate and blood because I never knew any better. But I wasn't brought up like them, I'm different and I know it. Oh, stop your I, I, I They don't hate you because you're no good. Because they're afraid of you. That's rich. We're all scared, Wyatt. They're scared for themselves. I'm damn scared. Being an officer doesn't give me nine lives. We don't want to die any more than you do. We've all got girlfriends we want to see again. But if you do something foolish, you can get us all killed. We need you, Wyatt. Does that help you to stick it? They wouldn't need me if I wasn't here. But you are here. So show some guts! You got it all wrong, sir. They all have. It's not that I haven't got any guts. I'm an amateur boxer at home. It's just that... i'm all immune, yes, sir. I don't fit in with all this. If you did a bit of fighting here, you'd fit. I did my best for him, sir. You can do one more thing for him. We help them bury him. - Come on, let's take it down there! - What a goalie! So you're the poor man's Johnny Ray, eh? Well, ain't that you with one of them Korean floozies, Sergeant? Well, don't let it keep your mind off your work. Lovely day, Sarge. Wish I were in Manchester! Nothing there. Seems as if they'd almost forgotten us. Chinks is like elephants, they don't forget. Funny like in the woods. Oh, there was nobody there, but you felt as if there was. Well, I'd better wake young Butler. Let him sleep on. It's all in. He fusses too much. He's not bad for an highbrow. He should have shot that Wyatt. Ah. Tom Payne! Sir! Nice football. What is this? A holiday camp? Well, sir, there's been nothing doing since stand to. The sun's cheered them up. Football's a great safety valve, sir, like you said talk was. We're expecting an attack, Sarge Payne. So was Drake, sir, when he played his holes. - Kim, get off! - Yes, sir. - Men had their rations? - Yes, sir. How much? I called in what the men had left over, added the dead's unexpended antiserum to a quarter. Good. Who's up there? Henson and Lockyer. And in the slit trenches? Ryker and Neill, just take note. I said bren's in the slit trenches! Yes, sir! I give Kim's to Ryker. Kim being on other duties. Sim's not needing his any longer. So Neil's taking it over. Take it easy, Sarge. Where's Wyatt? Oh, I stuck him up on the roof there, sir. To keep a lookout for Kim coming back. Neill seemed to have thought of everything. I mean, next time, wake me. I'd like to be in on it. Sorry, sir. Sarge! Sarge! Edge of the woods, sir. Get back to your post. They may not spot the places occupied. Keep back. Posing for his photograph. Ryker never could resist a sitter. Damn fool! There's one thing you've forgotten, Sarge Payne. Aircraft recognition panels. If our boys are stooging about, they might spot us. Oh, say do it at once. All we've got to do now is to wait till the chinks start throwing things. Come on, come on. Go on, hurry up. Any sign of him? No, sir. Here. Keep your eyes keen. Kim makes very good use of cover. It's amazing how allergic I've gotten to the open air. I used to work in a soap factory and I used to think, "Oh, for the open air" "The hills and the woods and the old birds and bees." "Oh, the smell of flippin' flowers instead of the soap." Nobody bothered to tell me that the woods would stink like a dead horse and there's millions of perishing ants to gnaw you through to the bone. And if you take your girl for a nice sit down, you get a yard of nettles up your trousers. You've been fooled, mate. You'd better go back to the soap works. There'll be Chinese soap works. Chinks don't have soap works. It's obvious. Don't you kid yourself about the chinks. The yellow man's superior to the white. And for why? There's more of him. 600 million chinks is a lot of chinks and if you don't believe me, go out and count them personal. I'll make it three under. So be mathematical. Be precise about the yellow peril. Three under he counts. So maybe I've got private information and if there's a war that makes my blood curdle, it's the yellow man against the white. And I'm warning you, I'm including myself out. Get out. They ain't civilised like what we are. That's just the point. That's why they're going to win. They haven't got the pleasures of civilisation to live for. We've got to get back to queuing for the granada Saturday nights. Pilot the local. Couple of bobble at the White City and out of court creeper suzetti on the TV. But them poor unfortunate chinks don't know the joys of living. So they fight like it's a joy to die. Mind you, I'm not saying I want them coming over to Bethnal Green and telling me, Jackie Rabin, what to do. I'll tell you what to do. Quiet! Enemy tank! Get the men out of the trenches! Back! Back! Get down! Only the chinks will try and bring that tank up that track. This is the chance we've been waiting for. Get back! You might be needed back there! Fire! You dirty little yellow... Hold on! I missed them! Watch my back! It's big enough, isn't it? Can't be sure at this range. Can't be sure. 80 yards is safer. Where do you want to be? Slit trench, sir. Well, there's your chance he's stuck. I'll go with him, sir. Ok, I'll give you a covering fire. Come on, get down! Quickly! Ryker!... Fire! Alright! Come on, you little darling. Let's have you. Don't make love to it. Fire it! Shh! Don't rush me. Want to see the whites of its eyes? I'm going to bust its track. You've done it! Well, come on. Now, never. You're a lovely boy, what are you? I'm a lovely boy. Beginner's luck. Pick the thing up. They've got it! Here, gimme that. Well? Sarge! Private Docker. The world's leading tank buster upper. Go on. It was an optical illusion. You should have such optical illusions. I'm one of the best, that's all. Hawkeye, they call me. I know what I'd call you. I suppose it'll cost a couple of quid to talk to you now. Jackie, while this war's on you can talk to me for free. But... when I'm back in civvy street, I'll have to be a bit choosy, mate. Take your filthy hands off me. You... you rat. I'll get you, Wyatt. What did he want to say that for? Oh, shut up! It was a dead man talking. Sir? Sir? Yes? Sergeant Payne spotted Kim. Pity. He was the toughest bloke we'd got. He's trying to get back. But there are snipers. Runs like a rutty gazelle. Poor little beggar. Well, he's showed us We can't get back that way. We have an issue of rations. Keep some for tomorrow. Right, sir. Keep down, Sarge Payne. I want to take you back with us. When's that, sir? Well, our bellows must mean something. Anything special? Nope. Only the flaming sniping. Ye, but our guns over there is music. Pity they don't open them up on the ropes in front. Ok. But keep down. Right. O'Brien sent me You all right, Neill? Just part of me Sarge. Wyatt was cut on a rope. Well, get back a bit. I know I'm angry, but I don't want my china reinforced with Chinese plaster. With China china. Listen to our guns, Jackie. I wonder what time is. I wonder what day it is. It's about 288 shopping days to Christmas. What are you going to buy me? Piece of fake lindo. You got me. You want to get some. They're useful. It's a nice Saturday afternoon in London. The sun's shining, they're packing the corner house. Arsenal's playing Chelsea. They've got a 60,000 crowd. Good raps. And someone's settling into your job and frisking with your girl. It's immoral. You've said it. No, I mean them playing football and us stuck up here. I don't know what I'm doing out here in the cape. Could blind me, I don't even come from a military family. It's always the same with these forgotten wars. You would of planted this crap in your home. Them would have been the boys of the bulldog breed. Can't do too much for our gallant lads. We'd be hearing the guns again and it would remind them what stands between a few million chinks and football pools. Five day week, feet up on the fireplace and I'm on strike against the union. Not that I'd be grudging but stuck out here on this perishing mountain and in the dark in this chamber of horrors with chinks all around us and a slug in the kisser if you put your head up. And us never likely to see a football match again. In honest it binds you rigid. Here, tell you what. Let's have this war out on Arsenal's ground. Standard prices, our boys versus the chinks. We'd pack the crowd in, they'd love us. Our Lindy, it's yours, free and for nothing. You put it up to White Hall. All I want is 10%. You mean beast. After all we've done to make the war interesting for you? I don't even want to be interested. I've only got two hobbies. One's Jackie Rabin and the other's girls. And the army's jeopardizing the first and depriving me of the second. I'm a normal and healthy type and the army's stopping me from reproducing my kind. And the army's not a bad judge. Wyatt! Get down! Henson, stop it! You can't stop me! I'm coming over! Nobody's going to stop me! Let me go! It's no use! I've got to go over! How far do you think you'd get? Two steps, the snipers will have you. I'll risk it, I'll wave something. I've got to go over, I've got to! Very well, Wyatt. Go! Give me something to wave then! I'm short of a white flag. Use your jacket. Go on. Take it off and wave it. Go on, Wyatt. What you waiting for, Wyatt? Get up and wave your little white flag. Don't shoot! Red! Comrade! Don't shoot, comrade! Wave it again, Wyatt. Go on. If the chinks don't get you, I will. Well what do you expect to happen? Go on, get inside, Wyatt. I've lost enough men on this patrol without shooting you myself. We can't stay here. Better try for a break out. Don't think we stand much of a chance, sir. I haven't got a white handkerchief. What about you? No, sir. We'll try the break out. We'll go at first light. We'll have the rest of the rations now. Then we'll go while this is in pisces. They're ours! They're our planes! Nothing from that lot. They're slipping. Lindy! Lindy? Lindy! Lindy! Lindy's had it, sir. They were our planes. All right. Steady now. I've seen them. Weren't they? Ours. Why didn't they see the panels then? They'd know we was here if we had a wireless. You..... They're coming at us. Rabin! Docker? All right, Wyatt? Yes. I'm alright. Hold your fire. Hold it! Wait for the order! Down! I reckon they've done the job this time, sir. Poor old Mooney. He's till lying out there, sir. Shall I go out and fetch him? Yes. I'll have that Bren of yours, Rabin. I'll fix them. They not covering fire, sir. Me and O'Brien will work round them. Okay. Here you are, Rabin. Sir. Fire! Wyatt, take this. Private. Wyatt... move it. Wyatt. Cease fire! You all right, sir? That Wyatt... probably unbalanced. Trying to rat again, sir? I don't think so. I'll get them ready to move off, sir. O'Brien. They're ready to move off, sir. You brought us through, sir. All right, let's get back to base. At 1800 hours on May the 12th, the survivors succeeded in rejoining their lines. For three days and two nights they had been in action against the enemy. It is to be noted that of the 16 original members of this patrol, 10 were national servicemen.
