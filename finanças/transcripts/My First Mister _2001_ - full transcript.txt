I think every girl should be provided-- so, I'm sitting in creative writing class surrounded by alien creatures with pretentious names like Ashley and Cody. hi. I'm not really into people. anyway, I think that if everyone just drove the same car, that it would put an end to, like, envy and jealousy and carjackings. all right, Ash. thank you. okay, uh, Ashley. thank you. let's see who's next. uh... Jennifer Wilson. my parents named me Jennifer Anne Wilson. my middle name is because someone is dead. I don't really have a passion for the name Jennifer, so I refer to myself as J.

I'm okay with that. once, when I was 14, I thought I was a lesbian. the question of my generation: to dive... or not to dive. but this one day my mom took me to her gym, and she stuck me in the steam room with a bunch of women posing as elephants. cured me of doubt. now I masturbate to a picture of Freddie Prinze Jr., and I'm quite certain of my sexual preference. I'm cooking a brisket for dinner tonight. a woman needs to eat blood every now and again. she just really does. * Billie who is ready * oh, no, it's my musical. * when I have a brand-new hairdo * * with my eyelashes all in curls * I think my mother was deeply affected by the divorce. * I enjoy being a girl * * when men say I'm cute and funny * * and my teeth aren't teeth but pearls * * I just lap it up * * like honey * * I enjoy being a girl * stop that. dad, the sperm that bore me, cheated on mom. blah, blah, blah. mom remarried.

"it makes sex amazing." ow ! maybe I should get some more piercings. I'm not busy. what is sex anyway ? if memory serves, technically, I'm still a virgin. there was this one day in third grade when Matthew Kingsley came over and we played doctor. he confused my vagina with my anus and took my temperature with a fire engine red crayon. from then on, whenever I'd hear a siren, I'd giggle. I never had a boyfriend. I don't know what I'd do with one if I did. guys like Calvin Klein G-string ad girls. I wear boxers. I once had an orgasm, though. with myself. I think. I'm gonna go to hell anyway. J ! yo, J ! eulogy number 432. "she was loved by no one. "she chose indifference as her state of mind.

Boo. * my love is a monster * Jennifer ! * my love is a monster ** honey, we're having leftovers. let me guess. brisket. baby, I could cook up something else for you. how about a vegetable souffle ? how would that be ? please come to the table. we could light those kind of candles that you like. inspiration.

I-- Jennifer, I can relate to what you're going through. honey ? adorning my face where the smile used to be once as a baby, when pain had no definition. now, grown and alone, my jewelry off, naked again, identity gone. Jen ? I had a dream last night that I had earrings all over my face. and I thought that this looked really cool. and then my maybe-boss made a suggestion. maybe you should pierce your ears. then I tell him-- - that is so sick. I'm keeping this one. fuck him. I think bruce would just love the way this feels. it's so soft, yet still masculine. well, I don't really know bruce, but if he'd like to come in and feel it for himself, I'm happy to hold it for him. what a dick. she'd do him right here in the daylight. - take a look at this. these are 30 percent off. - ow ! excuse me a moment. - hello. - h-hello. well, you look better. but in this store, we like to stand up. come on. come up. follow me, quickly. so, what does your mother call you ? uh, Jen, Jennifer, Jennikins, lamb of my loins. okay, all right, all right. I'll just call you J. this is Jack, one of our best salesmen. this is J, possibly our new stockroom girl. J, as in the bird ? yes. Jack, as in the box ? he's actually not bad-looking for an older, overweight, undesirably aged male. he has kind of a big butt for a guy. this is a wall of shirts. everything in this store is color-coded: button-down shirts, red; tab collar, blue; french cut, green. this is very important. the boy who worked here last, he didn't understand. and the reason we do this is that everything arrives in these boxes. a lot of times, what the boxes say is not what's in the box. you see the tab, you know where it goes and you're done. it's color-coding. it's important. color coding saves time. hello. are you listening to me ? the ins and outs of being an idiot. yeah. yes, i've-i've worked the stockroom before, sir. sir ? uh, my master. Randall. can I call you R ? sure. all right, if you have any questions, - I'll be out front. - yes, one question. - do-do I get the job ? - well, we're trying it out. what is your cat's name ? - black. - of course. he touched my tit. I ran into Betty Lewis over at the rite aid today. honey-- and I have to tell you, I liked it so much better when it was thrifty's. I mean, they've rearranged the whole place in the most-- excuse me, honey-- inappropriate mAnner. and actually, I have been thinking of speaking to the management about it. what do you think, Bob ? a-about what ? honey, at the rite aid. - please, Bob. the situation. - oh. - well-- - shh ! shh, shh. grandma's here. please. Bob, please. Jenny, that's not funny. your grandma's dead. shh. - she's allowed to visit. - I don't want this. I do not want this. I don't like it, Bob. I really don't like it. please-- honey-- what's the matter with you ? you know how sensitive your mother is about your grandmother. why would you do something like that ? and one last time, the sweaters are four steps, each arm first. by the way, the shirts are nine steps, but we'll get to that after you're comfortable with the sweaters. fold the body in and up, and it's folded. you're beyond anal. well, it's important to be organized. number one on my list. well, number one on my list is: "don't mock me." - and number two on my list is: "remember to stay back here, please." there's a man who really knows how to live. that is a man set in his ways. please don't make him this semester's science project. and get in the back before he sees you. can-can I help you with anything ? is-is there something I can help you with ? uh, no, just looking. that is lovely. that's the finest material in the store. I'm-I'm not a mugger. I work here. why else would I be in this nice clothing store ? oh, your eyes are that blue. oh, my God. there's this suit here that has this slight blue tinge running through it. it would be totally groovy with your eyes. - "groovy" ? - oh, groovy's back. check-check it out, man. what do you think ? it's very nice. so you have the yellow shirt and you have the tie-- oh ! it's nice. it is nice. oh, my God. funky stuff. - next time, ask first. - yes. yes, sir. listen, if you're not gonna stay in the back, which clearly you're not-- no. it's-it's clean, and it's spick-and-span. there's nothing more I can do, sir. all right ? you may think you know how to do this, but for every suit you sell, you're gonna send 30 customers running out of this store screaming. if you wanna sell, you have to look the part. dress me. the last time I had this much weird fun was with the fire engine red crayon. I look like a republican. you're no republican. thanks for being so cooperative. thank you very much for the clothes. thank you. - I'll pay you back. - I'm not worried about it. - good night. - good night. thank you. are you all right ? are you okay ? yeah. do you need a ride home ? sure. you don't have a car ? it didn't start this morning. are you thirsty ? no, not-not really. you bought me clothes. I'll buy you a cup of coffee. it's all right. come on. we can talk about my big promotion, boss man. actually, it's almost 9:00. 9:00. so ? well, I'm usually home by 9:00. what happens at 9:00 ? I turn into the same person I am. go ahead. excuse me. this is your hang, huh ? yeah. I never would've guessed. you should get a spider coffee with whipped cream. it's really good. hey, J, what's up ? what'll it be ? hey. can we get two number sevens, please ? actually, you know what ?

I read it. I'm sorry. I didn't know it wasn't meant for me. is this a suicide note ? yeah. don't worry, boss man. it's not for now. the sopranos are on hiatus. I want to see if they all kill each other. well, that's good to know. otherwise, I would keep you on at the store on a temporary basis. - that's funny. I mean, you should do that more often. do what more often ? joke around ? mm-hmm. I don't think so. people might get the wrong idea. what, that you're happy ? - what's that anyway ? - I'm not the one to ask. you know what I think ? I think happy is fucking overrated. I mean, my mom-- my mom's always happy. she's got this stupid smile on her face and she's singing, and it's just disgusting. so apparently, you don't think your mother is really happy. would you be, having me as your only child ? that's a good point. i-I have to tell you, I don't think this is the least bit attractive. yeah, and I really think that this is gonna get you on the cover of GQ. all right. you thinking of fucking me ? is there a bathroom in this place, or do you just go right on the floor ? yeah, right there. I can't believe I just asked my boss that. he could be my dad. I don't want another dad. I don't even like the one I have now. I want a lover. oh, I like that word. lover. lover. my lover's in the bathroom getting coffee out of his nose. yeah, whatever. * shakin' that ass * * shakin' that ass * * shakin' that ass * my lover. * I see you, baby shakin' that ass * * shakin' that ass shakin' that ass * * all right, don't touch me * * I see you, baby shakin' that ass * * shakin' that ass shakin' that ass * * I see you, baby shakin' that ass * * shakin' that ass ** I'm fine. I'm fine. so, you're ready to be a salesperson ? yeah. sure. fun. mmm. all right, I'm getting tired, so, uh-- I'm gonna run. you mind if I take you home now ? no, I'll-I'll hang. I can walk home from here. okay. - I'm sorry about your nose. - don't worry about it. tomorrow, we sell. great. and I won't fuck up. do you know the "boy who cried wolf" story ? I don't know. there was this little boy, and all day long he cried, "wolf !" "wolf is coming ! wolf !" but there really wasn't a wolf coming. then one day the wolf came, and nobody believed him. it just had no meaning. I would reconsider the use of the "fuck" word. good night. I'll see you tomorrow. good night. did your dad leave ? my lover. Jennifer ! Jenny ! Jenny ! you know, they have a noise ordinance in century city ! honey, you're doing windows. sweetie, you didn't tell me you were doing windows. and you're wearing a dress !

Mildred, I'd like to introduce you to Randall Harris of the Harrises. hi, Mildred. how are you ? that's a silly question. she might be a little shy. - I don't normally bring guests. - sure. why do you do this ? energy. I can feel their energy. a little bit of a thousand souls. come on, it's your turn. no, not just yet. lie down. close your eyes. I love these slacks. come on. - no, don't do that. no. - lie down. I'm coming down. close your eyes. now what ? now you start up a conversation. with whom ? the person you're sitting on. can you feel it ? can you feel their energy ? I feel it. you do ? god, I really do feel it. thanks for letting me crash here. hey, it's late. no problem. welcome. - nice house. - thank you. so... I'm gonna put on some hot tea. listen, if you feel that you want to take a shower, just go upstairs. I have fresh towels. make yourself at home. great. thank you. okay, so you're somewhere and you see somebody you know. what do you say ? I know you. no. hello. hey. hey. - hey. - all right. you're in the store. a customer's just tried on a suit. he looks quite handsome. what do you say ? hey, dude, funky stuff, man. yeah. I pray to god that's not it. you know, in spite of what you're doing, you should know that you're very beautiful. you think I'm beautiful ? you want to watch a video or something ? how about we have a staring contest ? don't do that with me, 'cause I'll kill you. fine then. let's see what you're made of. ready ? go ! you're blinking. hmm. again. - go. - go. you want some more tea ? oh, no. all right. all right. - where are you going ? - I'm gonna go for a run. when I get back, we need to talk. we have to have a little talk. okay. don't worry about me. I'm just gonna stay here and go through some drawers. so maybe you should save me some time and tell me where you keep all the good stuff. I don't have any good stuff. - that's sad. - oh, is it ? and you do ? - yep. - uh-huh. - where do you keep yours ? - in a box under my bed. I don't have a box under my bed. and you're the good stuff. I have a blue foot. so much stuff, so little time to snoop. oh... don't do it ! I have to. I just have to. don't do it. I have to. oh, I have to. okay. R ! R ! R ! R ! grandma ? R. get up ! get up ! hey, help ! somebody, help ! help me, please ! help ! please ! please, help ! J. hi, I'm patty. um... did Randall mention any family at all to you ? no. why does he need them ? as you probably know, he's had this for a long time. he's very sick and... the next few days are gonna be critical. I'm sorry. so you wouldn't suggest starting... any new magazine subscriptions ? I'm sorry, Randall. I don't know what to say exactly, but you've known all along how precarious this type of leukemia is. listen, you'll have some good days, you'll have some bad days. but when it becomes acute like this, our options are limited. can you hand me that bag ? we'll give you antibiotics to treat the infection, pain medication to keep you comfortable. chemotherapy's an option, but it's very risky. there are some experimental programs we're looking into, but those need F.D.A. approval. hey, there's my beauty. - we'll see you in a little bit. - call us if you need anything. - hey. - hey. you look good. you don't. come here. come over here. come here. you didn't say "Simon says." Simon says, "come here, please." so you just knew all along. yeah, I did. well, I'm gonna use the "fuck" word now. I understand. how can you do this ? how can you be sick ? you can't be sick, right ? because you would have told me you were sick, wouldn't you ? I'm sorry. I should have told you. I didn't tell anybody. I never even told my wife. it was like I thought if the words didn't come out, then maybe it wouldn't be true. does that make any sense ? so I'll just assume that you're gonna be okay, right ? Jennifer. you're not gonna be okay, and that really sucks. because for the first time ever in my whole non-perfect excuse of a stupid life, I really, really liked it ! I liked my life. - you still have your life. - no, I don't. I don't have my life because I love you so much. Jennifer-- wait a second. don't leave. where are you going ? if a person's on their deathbed, you have to stay and listen. it's the hospital rule. come back here. Jennifer... I spoke to your grandmother. oh, bullshit ! no, it's not bullshit. you taught me how to do it, and i've been doing it. oh, yeah ? what'd she say ? she said to stop this ! stop it ! you don't understand. you have all of these people who care about you. you have a family. - oh, yeah, great family. - oh, so what ? so they're all insane. go lock them up. who cares ? at least they're here. I wish my parents were still here. I can't even call them up and say, "I hate you." you don't know how lucky you are. - well, I don't feel so lucky. - you won't let yourself. you think this is why your grandmother is trying to talk to you ? don't you think she's got better stuff to do all day than to get through to nobody ? you're not alone. who is this talking, you or grandma ? I don't know. we're both talking. if it makes you feel better, it's mostly her. come here. no. come here. sit down. would you just once... do something I ask you the first time, please ? now you close your eyes, and you listen. come on. close your eyes. listen.

I'm here just in time to bury you." - what kind of friend are you anyway ? - I love him. - what kind of love ? - he's been my best friend. did you fuck him ? shit. look, I'm a bitter asshole, okay ?
