Robert, you're back! Morning, Robert. Rachel. Robert! My goodness. Where have you been? I was in Milano with a singing coach. - But not for two years? - Sorry for being so long. I was stuck between a countertenor and a tenor, but... now my deeper voice has come through. I can study with Lena again. That's wonderful. I... I... I can't wait to hear you sing. I can't wait to sing for you. The last time you heard me sing, just before I left, I gave you an uninvited goodbye Kiss. That was reason enough to leave town, it was so clumsy. I remember. I think... I tried to kiss you back and I wasn't any better. So are you practising for a recital? Uh, yes, in March. And we still have the Lodz Ensemble. We... We play Sundays at the tea pavilion, mostly classical, but some popular songs. You should come and see us, maybe bring along a singer, if you can think of one. I'll see what I can dig up. Henrik Karwowski is giving a concert at Strav Hall on Friday evening. Would you like to go with me? I... It's sweet of you to you to ask, but I can't, really. You're busy? I'm engaged. Engaged? To who? To... to David. I know it's none of my business, but I thought you weren't keen on that idea. I... It was great to see you, Robert. Likewise. Robert. You're back. - Still singing? - Still at it. Good. Well, um, we must be off. But it was, uh... it was a pleasure to see you. It was a pleasure to see you too. - There you go. - Thank you. German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop told the Polish ambassador last week that Poland must accept the cession of the Free City of Danzig to Germany. Hi, Dad. Bad news? It doesn't matter. Robert! Look where you're going, boy! How awful! - Don't you agree? - About what? What they're doing to the bear. He could be worse off. How could he be worse off? Maybe a hunter could be trying to shoot him. Bet you didn't think of that one, did you? - Thank you. - Thank you. This way. Come on. Are all these people going to the Music Academy? Yes. But I don't know everyone, so I'll introduce you to the ones I do know. Your dad works for mine, so we're sort of family already, you know? - Mrs. Drabowski. - Welcome, Robert. - Hello. - Oh, I told Robert that if anybody gives him trouble, tell 'em he's friends with me. Well, I'm happy you're looking out for him. Come on, let's go. Hello, everyone. It's good to see you again. Sorry. We have a new student this year, This is the girl I saw before this. Robert Pulaski, who just moved here from Lipowa. Please give him a nice welcome. All right. Let's see what you remember about Chopin. What was his dying wish? Rachel? That his heart be returned to Poland. She's a difficult one, isn't she? Correct. While Chopin was known for many different kinds of compositions, which form did he actually invent? Robert, please. Uh, I think Rachel's hand was up first. No. I'm sure Robert's hand was. No, I was just really mad at myself because you beat me again. - See, I looked over and saw your hand up before I raised mine. Then why did you raise yours at all? Just in case you were wrong. Robert, enough. You shouldn't go up against that girl. She's like a witch or something. Yes! Thank you! Finally. Wait! This way. Come on. Up here. Come on. Whoa. This is amazing. Oh, you haven't seen anything yet. - So is this a library? - Yes. But you see this book? It hides a key... to a hidden room. This is Vlad. Vlad, this is Robert. - Hello. - Hello. Lovely to meet you. - This is where we practice. - Practice? Why don't you go find yourself a chair, Robert? - Vlad, an A? - Oh, yes. Anna, Robert. Robert, Anna. - Hello. - Now... we just need to make sure that Mrs. Drabowski doesn't find out that we're up here. Robert, Sara. Sara, Robert. And this is my sister, Rachel. Oh, no... Mr. Had No Idea What the answer was. I was being polite. What are you two talking about? Do you know Pergolesi's Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor Opus 77. No. But I do know this. Robert, how are you? I'm good. Thank you, Mr. Mann. Great. Here's your father. Hey, Robert, what are you doing here? - Uh... - Uh, he still owes us 300. Okay. So, what is it? I want to quit the violin. I'm the worst in the group. You can't just quit the violin because you're not the best. The other violinist, she makes me sound like I'm playing a pitchfork. She... - It's a girl? - Yes. It's just so embarrassing to play next to her. Well, just keep practising. And if you work hard enough, you'll be slightly less embarrassed. Come on! It's one and a half beats, Robert. All right. Should we try it again? Bravo. Oh, Franz! - Cheers. - To our children. - Yes. - And to our good fortune for having them. Do any of you know what you're going to do for your Christmas amends yet? We still have ten days. I think I might tell my neighbours it was me who kicked a soccer ball into their backyard and killed one of their chickens. Wish I had something like that. Sometimes I call you both names but you know I don't mean them, so I don't think I need to apologise. But I'm sure you could get along with someone better. What? What? No. Not Rachel. She's horrible! That's not a very nice thing to say, Robert. I... I'm sorry, Mrs. Drabowski, but Vlad and Wolf think I should make my Christmas amends to her, even though we can't stand each other. Well, that makes her the perfect candidate, then. That's why we have the tradition. She's Jewish. She doesn't even know our tradition. Better get it over with now and not have to worry about it over the holidays. There has to be someone else. He's going up to her! Uh, Rachel? I was wondering whether we could talk. About what? Uh, it... it's... it's kind of private. Should we go outside? Hey! So... Did you like my recital? Yes. Yes, it was great. Which part did you like the best? The end, maybe. What part of the end? Why are you asking me all this stuff? You didn't even watch it, did you? Wait, Rachel! I have something I need to talk to you about. What? I just wanted to say... I'm sorry I don't like you. Why don't you like me? Because you think you're so smart. Like everyone else is so stupid. But... what am I supposed to do, pretend I don't know things? No, just don't smear it in people's faces. I only do it so... people will notice me. Otherwise, I just walk around alone. You see, I don't make friends very easily. But you could. You're very noticeable. Guess we should go back inside. Look. Shall we? Robert, where did you get that voice from? Yes, where did you? Listening to Enrico Caruso's records. And of course, Benno Moser. I sing along. Well, then... perhaps I should bring you along to his concert next month. That would be really great. Thank you. It was so nice of Mrs. Drabowski to get us tickets to this. Well, it probably helped that Benno Moser's her brother. I'm looking forward to seeing Bruno this evening. David. Who's that with Rachel and Sara? The Rosenwalds and their son, Prince David. He's a real prince? No, his father's just one of the richest men in Europe. Do they live here? No, mostly in Switzerland. Are they related? No, they're just family friends. But I've heard that their families want them to get married. Why? Do you have a crush on her? No! She's Jewish and I'm Catholic. There couldn't be a crush. Dark scaffold, Flames ascending, with maddening glow! Quench them, vile monsters, or your blood shall flow! Woeful Mother, I fly to save you, And if I fail, with you I die! To arms! To arms! Brava! - Did you like it? - Yes, quite, quite! Simply marvellous! Thank you. I'm very happy you came. He's busy, you can see. Uh, excuse me for a second. - Opera buffs? - Oh, Yes. True aficionados of the finer things in life. I see. Well, you had a great voice tonight. - I know, I know. - Yes. And who are these young gentlemen? Robert Pulaski and Wolf Mann, meet Germany's greatest tenor. - Lovely to meet you. - And my brother. I've listened to all your records, Mr. Moser, over and over again. I'm flattered. - Are you singers? - No, not me. No, I'm just a kid. Not really. He's an excellent singer. Is that so? I... I sing alone. To myself. Well, sing something for me. - Now? - Yes. No, i... I'm really not good enough. Come on. Sing. Bravissimo, Robert. You're very, very talented for your age. Lena, you must nurture this budding talent. He may have a future in the opera. I'll see you at dinner. If you continue singing after your voice has changed, you must come and study with me. That's an honour, right there. - Did he really mean it? - Yes, he did. Robert. You have an amazing voice. Come along, children. It's good to see you. Good to see you. How did you even get in? They don't usually allow people under 50. Yes, I gotta say, I'm getting a little tired of playing "The Blue Danube." Rachel said you're playing some popular songs too? So you know then? About Rachel. I always thought you two were made for each other. That kind of hostility, is, uh, hard to find. Vlad. Forget all that. Let's wake these people up. Do you know "Undecided"? - Yes. Sure. - "Undecided." ♪ First you say you do, ♪ ♪ and then you don't ♪ ♪ And then you say you will, ♪ ♪ and then you won't ♪ ♪ You're undecided now, ♪ ♪ so what are you going to do? ♪ ♪ Now you wanna play ♪ ♪ and then it's no ♪ ♪ And when you say you'll ♪ ♪ stay, that's when you go ♪ ♪ You're undecided now, ♪ ♪ so what are you going to do? ♪ ♪ I've been sitting ♪ ♪ on a fence ♪ ♪ And it doesn't ♪ ♪ make much sense ♪ ♪ "Cause you keep me ♪ ♪ in suspense and you know it ♪ ♪ Then you promise to return ♪ ♪ When you don't, ♪ ♪ I really burn ♪ Well, I guess I'll never learn, and I show it. ♪ Mm, mm... when so bright ♪ ♪ Now we come to realise ♪ You can't marry him, Rachel. But he's a good man. But not for you. And you are? I haven't seen you in two years. And you walk in here, pretending like there's something between us. I can't remember a time I haven't thought about you. Our parents would never allow it. You've always been such an optimist, Robert. You can't... ask me to believe in some kind of love between us, something that can never be. Jews have been driven out of every profession in Germany. I have heard there were beatings in the streets, stores looted, synagogues burnt. They've even set up a labour camp for women now. Aleks, it's Shabbat. Can't we talk of other things in front of the girls? I'm sorry, darling. Well, um... I've got a birthday coming up on the 3rd of next month... - Really? - And I was hoping Rachel would come and celebrate it with us in Zürich. What a wonderful idea. I... I'd love too, David, but I'm playing in a violin competition in Prague from the 3rd to the 5th. Well, couldn't you go to another one? There are no other ones, at least not that I can still get to. She always wanted to go to the one in Wien, but that's Germany now. No, Prague is the next best thing. Well, are you sure it's safe... when the Germans are all around in the Sudetenland? And have been for seven months. Well, is there a large first price for this contest or something? I'm less concerned about winning it than whether I'm worthy of playing with the best musicians in my field. And once you know? Then I will continue to play, hopefully with a prominent orchestra. Rachel... you have so many great things ahead of you: marriage, family. And there won't be much time left for playing the violin. Music is a part of who I am, David. I hope that's something that you'll learn to understand about me. Of course. I... I hope you get out of it what you want. Your attention, please. All passengers for Train 117 to Prague, please begin boarding on Track Number 5. Train 117 to Prague on Track 5. All aboard. Robert. What are you doing here? I just wanted to wish you luck. Oh... - Hello, Robert. - Lena. I just received a telegram from my friends in Prague. German troops are massing at the Czech borders. - It's no longer safe. - I know. I... I've wanted to go to this competition since you told me I have the talent. I... Th... this could be my only chance. It's just too dangerous. Train for Prague is about to depart! Robert, what would you do? I'd probably go and get myself killed. I can't let you go. It would be irresponsible of me. Then I'll go with her. That would be irresponsible of me too. Would you really do that for me? Yes. Lena, would you turn around? I can't let you go. Please. Lena, trust me. Please turn around. Okay. Uh, we can go now. Thank you. - This is exciting. - Yes. I was thinking, in a few years, we could be the most famous musicians from Lodz, apart from Arthur Rubinstein. And now I lie in bed, picturing us on stage together. Just you and me? No, me and Arthur Rubinstein. Have you ever been with David? No. I've never been with anyone. Have you? Well, um... Tell me. No, tell me! Well... my uncle took me to a brothel on my birthday. He said it was time I became a man. What was it like? It was difficult. There was this big dog in the room, you know, to protect the woman if a man got rough with her. So was that your... your... Wien competition? Not really. I got scared of the dog. Besides... you're my Wien competition, and not even the Nazis are going to make me miss that. Through the snow, Adolf Hitler's legions of shock troops take over Czechoslovakia after a quick strike invasion, which outraged all freedom- loving nations of the world. Artillery and infantry roll into Prague. Soldiers striding through the streets of the city now reduced to the capital of a German protectorate. Adolf Hitler was there himself to oversee the transition. Czech citizens can only watch, knowing that resistance is all but futile. I had a dream about us last night. What were we doing? I dreamt... that we were at the Queen's Hall, playing with the London Philharmonic. Well, that would mean I was an usher. They don't do opera at Queen's Hall. Try to dream about us... at La Scala. That's an opera house. There must be some place good for both of us. What about Carnegie Hall? Carnegie Hall is great. It's my birthday on Tuesday. What would you like for your birthday? Just you. You can go now. Thank you. Thank you. Girls, your mother and I have something to tell you. There will be a war here. Hitler... will invade Poland, and that will put us in grave danger. Where will we go? Zürich. Switzerland's a neutral country. And since the Rosenwalds live there, we could have your wedding without the danger of travel. You know, Rachel, you could show a little more interest in David. You hardly ever talk about him. I like David. I'm just not sure that I want to marry him. You're engaged. I know. And... I feel badly, but... I don't think I love him. You can learn to love David. Rachel... is there someone else you are interested in? She does spend a lot of time with Robert Pulaski. Shut up, Sara! You don't know anything. Robert Pulaski. He's a nice boy, but... I know and I don't want to argue about this now! There will be no arguments. This Catholic boy can offer you nothing! If the Germans invade, he'll fare little better than we will. Maybe, but Robert's the only person that I know who actually understands who I am. Oh, well, that's a fine thing to say to us. I didn't mean it like that, I just... Maybe I'm a difficult person to know. Well, when we go, you're moving too. I know! Goodnight. Rachel... What's wrong? My father says there's going to be a war. We're moving to Zürich. To be near David? He said I'd be... throwing away my financial security, and... And the safety of my family. He has a point. At least about the first part. How long before you go? I don't know. Where are you from? - München. - How bad is it there? Terrible. The Nazis control everything. We had to get out, be some place free, some place we can breathe. Lena says you know how to handle a fiddle. Mmm. See this book? It hides the key to the secret room. Nobody knows about this place. Not even Mrs. Drabowski. I don't know about it either. Thank you. And? I think you'll like the house I found in Zürich. When do we leave? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Yes. Girls. Sara, get up. We need to go to the cellar. Come on! - Rachel. - Come. Come, come. - Robert! - Not the window! - Hurry up! - Come on, we have to get down to the cellar! - What about Rachel? Forget her! German Luftwaffe and regular army units have attacked a number of cities all over Poland, effectively targeting air fields, train stations, and electricity power plants in an effort to destroy the Poles' ability to counter Hitler's aggression. England and France officially declared war on Germany yesterday, but it could be several more days before either country can muster troops and aircraft sufficient to help the Polish... Probably knocked over a few bookcases, but... so far there doesn't seem to be any sort of structural damage to the building. One more to be covered on the ground floor. Oh, good. Thank you. Are you going to keep the school open? Until whoever the new authorities are say I can't, yes. I don't have that much hope they'll be Polish. Good thing the Rubins got out when they did. I don't think they did. What? They're supposed to be on the eight o'clock train. The bombing started four hours earlier. Well... we're just glad the damage wasn't worse. - I'll be right back. - Sure. Will there be more bombing? Just selected targets here and there. We're bombing Warsaw now. The Eighth Army division should be here in a couple of days. I wish I could march with them. You're more valuable being inconspicuous for now. We'll give them the Rubins instead. Bye. Only a handful of students know about this space. There's a simple lavatory down the hall, but... please be careful when you leave the room. We'll bring food and water every day. It's this way. Here, I'll take it. Thank you. I hope you can make yourselves comfortable here. Thank you. It's not very large, I'm afraid. Thank you, Lena. We are more than happy to have it. There can be no movement during the day. No sound, please. I'll be the last one out, so when I leave, you'll know the building is empty. Does anybody else know we're here? Just myself and Robert Pulaski. But your secret's safe with him. Adolf Hitler repeated today that he invaded Poland to protect Germans... Robert. We have some news. Sit down. Please. Okay. ...designed to annex all the states standing in the way of Germany in Eastern Europe, an expansion of... We are going to Paris. ...to restore Germany's pre-World War I... No. I'm sorry, I'm not going. - I'm not going. - But you can't stay here! Yes, I can. I can stay with Wolf and his family. They're German. The Nazis won't touch them. But... but how are you going to go out on the street? - There is a curfew at night. - I'll be careful. You have to come with us. There's nothing you can do to help that girl. I'm Polish. This is my country! I couldn't live with myself if I just ran away. It's not running away! It's realizing that you're putting your life at risk for a battle you can't win! - No one knows what will happen. - I do. We know war... No. I'm old enough to make up my own mind. And no matter what, I'm staying. What... Tell me why I shouldn't have you shot. "Cause I haven't done anything. Stop! - Robert, is that you? - You know this guy? Yes, he's a friend of mine. I'm here to join. I'm Czernecki. If Vlad is wrong about you... I kill you myself. Kind of a softie. Behind the junk. The bars over the basement window are loose. Remember to put your backs through first. Follow Janek. If there's any trouble, move to counter-escape. You have 11 seconds where neither guard is looking this way. On my count. Three, two, one. - Good luck, softie. - Go. Okay. Go. They're all in the back. We're running short. Remember the... Come in, Janek. Come in. There's canned goods, as well as jerky, dried fruit and vegetables, and some medical supplies. Give it to Janos. - What's happening? - They are late. Go to the other side. - Hey! - Stop there! You! What are you doing? Stop! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Halt! Janek! Get in! - Hi, Andre. - Glad you made it. Where is Janek? Sorry about Janek. Could've happened to any of us. Thanks for, you know... Forget it. Part of the job. Hello? It's Robert. Hello, Mr. Rubin. Hello, Robert. I bought some bread for Shabbat. Thank you so much, Robert. - Hello, Robert. - Hi. I joined the resistance. Really? - Have you shot anyone? - Sara! Not yet. Father, I'd like to speak to Robert alone. Here? We'll... we'll just go down the hall. We... we won't make any noise. All right. But don't be gone long. Aleks, this is no passing thing. Still, you must be encouraged to rehearse whenever you have some spare time. Well, I'm trying to encourage... Not much action tonight. No trains or convoys coming in. Last night, we intercepted food delivery on Piotrkowska Street. So they will be prepared tonight. Okay, well, the ammunition factory's here. It's safe to come out now. - And what about sweeps? - According to Gulaski, the SS is doing one in the textile district. And another one of the schools in the south sector. It'd be nice to play some music. Let's make it something cheerful. Tonight, on our broadcast, we proudly present... a Rubin family concert. A waltz. - Oh, a waltz. - A waltz! Don't look down! - Let her go! - Sara, keep walking! You don't need to force us like this! - Do what they say, Miriam! - My violin! Let go of me! Let her go! - Miriam! - Sara! - Miriam! - Keep walking. Do what they say. Okay, Sara. Sit there. Let me go! Sara. Sara... Be quiet. I'll find you. I find you! I'll find you! The Germans got the Rubins. You have to get out of here now. They're going to hold you responsible for the Rubins being there. You'll have to cut across Slovakia. But with your papers and your Austrian name, you should be fine. - How do I get there? I'm sending Vlad with you. You should get some rest. Magda, please show her where she can sleep for the night. Thank you. Thank you, Robert. Hey. My girl was on that truck. What time tonight was she taken? Uh, ten. Lukasz. When was the first prisoner train after ten tonight? - 1:20. - To where? She's due tonight, to... Auschwitz. If she was on the train, they took her to the camp there. You almost ready? I think so. I'm just following Viad, really. There's still one thing you can help me with. I want to go to Germany. To understudy with Benno, if he'll have me. - But why now? To see if he can help me get Rachel out. As soon as I get to Salzburg, I'll call him and tell him you're coming. Thank you, Lena. And you get her there safe, or I'll hunt you down myself. Ah, she's in better hands than yours. Don't worry. Be careful. It'll be all right. These papers say you are my nephew, Robert Hesler. Forget the name Pulaski. You let that slip once... and you are dead. Here's money your parents left for you. You'll need it. Thank you for all your help. I'll pay you back someday. All I need is for you to come home safe. We need to get inside. I'll light a fire. This is for the Rubins. Train number 212 is in final boarding to Berlin on Track number 7. You have dark eyes for a true German. Great-grandfather was Italian. It's what my family always says, anyway. You know you match the description of a young man suspected of smuggling food to Jews? A witness said the man's name was "Pulaski"? I don't know anyone by that name. Pulaski? Hey, Hesler! I forgot to have you sign this. Sure. Good to see you, young man! I hope your trip was without incidence. A little intense at the start, but here I am. To become a great artist, one has to take great risks. Can we get you anything? A drink? I'm fine, but thank you. Sir. Lena tells me that your voice is quite remarkable. Did she tell you about why I'm here? You're here to sing. I didn't come all this way just to sing. I thought you could help me find out if she's alive. You like Wagner? Richard Wagner, German composer 1813 to 1883. Yes. I need to give your voice a listen. ♪ Hitler, ♪ ♪ has only got one ball ♪ ♪ I Goring, ♪ ♪ has two but very small ♪ ♪ Come on, Robert. ♪ ♪ Let's hear it! ♪ ♪ Hitler, ♪ ♪ has only got one ball ♪ ♪ I Goring, ♪ ♪ has two but very small ♪ ♪ Himmler has ♪ ♪ something similar ♪ ♪ But poor old Goebbels ♪ ♪ has no balls at all ♪ Ah! You're a raw talent. And you're certainly capable of sharing the stage with me. Are you familiar with Wagner's Tristan und Isolde? Of course. It's Hitler's favourite. We're going to sing it to him. In five weeks. You're wearing out your shoes. Relax. I'm not nervous. I don't get nervous at this sort of thing. You've never been to one of "these things." Sit down before you faint. We've been over this. Remember? First the introduction. Then the lights go down. The theatre's quiet. All you can hear are some squeaks from the strings, the occasional cough from the audience. Oh, God, I love that time. Don't worry. If you're only half as good as me, you'll be fine. Sing to Rachel. Thank you. Thank you. To the finest Tristan. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - To Benno. - To Benno. I told this wunderkind that when his voice matured I'd welcome him on stage. And also introduce him to the upper echelon of German society, to those with refined taste, like yourselves. Yes, we are a cultured people. - Here, here. - Here, here. I'd like you to meet two of my friends, General Huber and his lovely wife, Greta. I must say, in all my years of attending the opera, I have not seen a better debut by a newcomer. - Thank you. - Wagner is a master. Our Führer is indeed fond of him. - Can have a word with you? - Yes. Keep him busy. Come. You're lucky to have a mentor like Benno. He's a wonderful man. It was painful being in the same room as those people. Did you like the Hubers? They're exemplary people. They're just as bad as the rest of them. Well, my very good friend, General Huber, whom you despise, actually dug up some... information about your girlfriend. What did he say? She's alive, in Auschwitz. Oh, my God. Playing with the women's orchestra. Is there anything we can do? Can he help us her out? You're killing me. You had a great success tonight. Enjoy that. "Get her out." Jesus. Morning, Robert. Good morning. - Morning, George. - Morning, sir. - Good morning. - Madam. - Tuesday. - Tuesday. - Bye. - Thank you. What? I need to wind down after a show, and alcohol is not my vice. It's women. - Does her husband know? - Well, of course he does. It's just that due to a war injury, he's no longer capable. And he prefers his wife to be with someone he knows and likes. I'm sorry, but I still do not understand that. That doesn't matter. What's important is that he knows Commandant Kramer at Auschwitz, and he's arranging for us to go there and sing. Heil Hitler. This concept is all an elaborate birthday present from me to Kramer. Remember... don't let anyone suspect that you know Rachel. Don't look at her. You don't know how she will react if you do. It could be a death sentence for her. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Welcome, Maestro! It's a real pleasure to have you here. Thank you. Great music is what my camp is known for. Yes, so I've heard, Hauptsturmführer. So who are your best players? They're all the best of their kind, but my first flute and violin are a match above the rest. Fantastic. So where do you find them? Wherever I want! And I take very good care of them. We have the honour of having with us tonight the great tenor, Benno Moser. Plus, his discovery, Robert Hesler. We will open with the "Flower Song" from Carmen. As you know, this is the story of the downfall of Don José, who was entranced by a woman of an inferior race, a gypsy, which, of course, leads to his destruction. The flower you threw me I kept with me. Withered and dry, It smelled just as sweet, For hours, with my eyes closed, Its fragrance intoxicated me. And each night I saw you. I began to curse you, and ask myself: Why did fate put you in my path? I was wrong to question fate: One hope, Cast one glance, and I longed for you. I am yours! I love you. Bravo. Bravo! Bravo! Carnegie Hall. What did he say? Something sweet. Goodnight, Maestro. Thank you again for a great evening of music. - It was a pleasure. - Night. Especially singing with your first violinist. Her playing has a wonderful quality. - Yes. - Come on, let's go. I was wondering if you would grant me a favour. I'd like to take her on tour with me. She's a Jew. You can't hear that. Her playing goes so well with my voice. It's very rare for me to find such a compatible tonal quality. I would be willing to contribute to whatever the orchestra may need. There is nothing we need. And she belongs here, in my orchestra. I understand that. Have a good night. Rachel must despise me... think I'm a traitor. When you sang... she played with love. Kraus. What? A man I don't want to talk to. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. My friend! So good to see you. Please, it's Obergruppenführer Kraus now. Obergruppenführer! Well... I think I prefer Werner. You seem happy. I suppose that's more thanks to beautiful Maria than to the promotion. She is an enchantress, and I thank you for the introduction. So, what can I do for you, Maestro? Well, I have a fairly simple request. There's a young lady named Rachel Rubin who played in the orchestra in Auschwitz when I sang there. She's a remarkable talent. I'd like her freed so I can take her on tour with me. Auschwitz is a special case. The commandant there is very proud of his orchestras. - All of them. - I know. Yes, Rachel Rubin, first violin in both the Women's Orchestra and the ADP Symphony? Yes. Quite a valuable musician. This will be difficult. I understand that it would involve some expenses, SO... maybe this would make it easier. She's also a Jew. Not really. She's actually a half-Jew, because I had a... A dalliance with her mother, and she's the result of that. I like to think that it's thanks to my genes that she's such a remarkable talent. I would, of course, have tried to get her out earlier if I'd only known where she was. I hope this will make it possible for me to reunite with my daughter. It would mean a lot to me, Werner. Your generosity will not go unrewarded. Thank you. So, when can I expect her? She would be delivered to your house in two days. You will probably have to delouse her, though. It's been three days. This is Benno Moser calling. Obergruppenführer Kraus, please. Well, it doesn't matter why! Just tell him it's Benno Moser. What do you mean, he doesn't know me? Of course he knows me. Everybody knows me. Put him on the goddamn line! A weasel. He took the money and now he doesn't know me. So that's it? Wait. Operator, get me Auschwitz ll- Birkenau. Hauptsturmführer Kramer, please. It's Benno Moser calling. Is... An... and his orchestra, wh... I see. I see. Thank you. Kramer has been transferred to another camp, Bergen-Belsen. But he took the orchestra with him. What can we do? Well, at least we know where she is. And it's closer, maybe easier. Everything is falling apart for them. Robert... Hitler will be dead soon. How do you know that? Come, come, come, come, come! Yes, come, come, come. Yes! Come, come, come. Away! - Benno Moser? - Yes? We have arrested Lieutenant General Huber. So? We have it on good authority that you have plotted with Lieutenant General Huber and others to kill the Führer. This is absurd! What is this? You have no right! Who are you? Robert. Robert Hesler. Are you a fugitive? I haven't shot anyone, if that's what you mean. Are you a good worker? We need a helping hand. Our boy was killed in the war. We'll keep you safe as long as you need.

Where you been, lad? Do you know anything about the camp at Bergen-Belsen? Yes, we liberated it a couple of days ago. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Go steady with him. I need your help urgently. Just stay in line, please! You'll be seen in good time! Here you are, mate. - Thank you. - Yes? Do you have any information about a Rachel Rubin? Rubin? I know she was transferred here from Auschwitz. - Ah. - And her family as well, maybe? Let's see... Rubin. Um... Uh, Aleksander, Miriam... It says here the Rubin family died in Auschwitz. Rachel Rubin, however, was definitely transferred here to Bergen-Belsen, but... but she was evacuated by foot about three weeks ago. To where? You could call it a death march. They weren't designed for anyone to ever reach a destination. The Red Cross intercepted a few of them. Now, I wouldn't get your hopes up, but you can check with the Red Cross Refugee Centre in Amsterdam. Thank you. Uh, yes, next? All right. First name? It's him! Leader of hell! Pig! That's enough! Enough! You killed my children! - Sit down! - You took my family! Hey, Kramer. Remember me? Singer, pals with the traitor Moser. If I had known, I'd have killed you both. The violinist, Rachel Rubin. Where did you send her? North. Through the woods, on a camping trip. She played like a... heavenly angel. Still a Jew, though. Probably got what was coming. So will you. Move! - Nazi scum. - How dare you? Robert? Robert? Robert Pulaski? I'm Ilana Barshay. I played second violin to Rachel the day you sang at Auschwitz. You survived! Do you have any idea about what happened to Rachel? All' I know is she always talked about meeting you in New York one day. Seeing you again was what kept her going. Thank you. Thank you for being her friend. Clear all barracks now. The burning is about to begin. - Burn. - Do it! Yes. The time has come. Yes, finally. Burn in hell! Oh! Thank you! We intercepted two marches north of Bergen-Belsen. We may have picked her up. But if she wasn't a Swedish citizen, we couldn't record it and still operate within Germany. However, there is a chance she was taken to New York on their refugee ship. Excuse me. Excuse me. Is there a Rachel Rubin on the list of recently arrived camp survivors? Rachel Rubin. Rubin... Yes. She was sponsored by a European organisation, but we don't have an address for her. - She was here? - Yes. Wait a second. I will check in the phone book. Thank you. I was so glad when you called. I wouldn't be here without Benno. He was a real hero. Oh, my God, it's the Two Stooges! Where the hell have you been? Probably singing in some dive in Tunisia or something. Been looking for Rachel all over Europe. No luck? Well, she came to New York. I've got a whole list of Rubins to visit. Looks like it's going to take quite some time. Why don't you give me some? Thanks. With my luck, she's probably moved on by now. No. We'll find her. Hello. Does Rachel Rubin live at this address? Ra... Rachel Rubin. Hi, does... does Rachel Rubin live here? Hello. Hi. I was told there's a Rachel Rubin working here? - No. - Does a Rachel... Rachel... Sorry. Lena? - Oh! - My God... Oh, I've been looking for you! I'd almost given up. Um, come in. Come in. Um... Sorry. Um... Would you like some tea? I just made some. Little different from home, but... it's nice enough tea. I found a... a restaurant in... down town, in, uh... the East Village. It's Ukrainian, but they have borscht and all sorts of... all sorts of things. It has sugar in it, though. They put sugar in everything. In bread. Sugar in bread. I'm so sorry about your family. They said that if I played... they would spare them. I knew better. Would it be a comfort for you to know that... almost all your friends are here? - Even Robert. - Robert? He's been looking for you everywhere. He'd be so glad when I tell him... No. No. He can't know that I'm here. Why not? He loves you. I'm a very different person. Playing in the orchestra saved my life. But, it... it also took so much from me. They heard me playing when they came off the trains. They heard me playing as they walked to the chambers. You haven't played since? No. We're arranging a concert to benefit Polish refugees. Right here in New York City. Robert's going to perform several songs in... Please don't ask me to play. Oh. I'd be a disappointment to him. You could never disappoint him. Please. All right. You don't have to play. Just consider coming to the concert. Please. I should go. Thank you. It's good to see you. Next on our program, please welcome the Lodz Ensemble with Robert Pulaski. Thank you. Joining me on stage today, we have Wolf Mann, Vlad Dagmarov, and Anna Volska. Originally, though, there were two other members, Sara and Rachel Rubin. Sarah died at Auschwitz, and we've been unable to reconnect with Rachel. In honour of them, and so many others who are missing, I will sing "Che Faro Senza Euridice" by Gluck. What will I do without you, Euridice? Where will I go without my love? What will I do? Where will I go? Where will I go without my love? Euridice God, answer me! I am still true I am still true to you. And there is no help, no hope for me, Neither on earth Nor in heaven. What will I do without you, Euridice? Where will I go without my love? What will I do? What will I do without my love? What will I do? What will I do... without my love? What will I do without my love? - Bravo! - Bravo! Hey, hey. Uh, did a girl in a red dress just come by here? Up the street, towards the park. Thank you. - Taxi! - Sorry. Excuse me. Taxi! Thank you. I just wanted to see what it would feel like to play again. And how was it? - It was better than I thought. - Then keep on playing! I'd like to hear some more. ♪ Na, na, na- na- na, ♪ ♪ na, na, na- na- na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, ♪ ♪ na, na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na- na- na, ♪ ♪ na, na, na- na- na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na, na, na ♪ ♪ Na, na, na- na- na, ♪ ♪ na, na, na- na- na ♪ ♪ Na ♪ You'll never get rid of me now.
