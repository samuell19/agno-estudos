December 30th, The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announces. An emergency notice for the treatment of the unexplained pneumonia. Please leave me a good rating! Medical institutions in Wuhan have continuously discovered. An unexplained variation of pneumonia in some patients. The notice also requires all hospitals. To closely monitor and record all patient situations. Doctor Wen, You have a lot of packages. Want to get them now? Can you keep it first? I'll come get them when I have time. Thank you! No problem. Doctor Wen, The patient's face, neck, and arms have turned purple, Blood oxygen is low. Four other patients with the same symptoms were admitted today. Report your findings to the director immediately. Call an emergency meeting with all departments now. Look at these X-rays, Their lungs appear to have ground glass opacity. They all seem similar. Some of the patient's are conscious and responsive, I asked them. They all live in different districts. Between the patients, There weren't any overlaps in exposure. We performed pharyngeal tests on them, Negative. There were no signs of any virus. Also, A couple of hospitals called. And asked if they could transfer some patients over, We should decline, right? Accept them. Accept every single patient affected. Also, Let everyone know. From now on, All personnel entering the ward. Must follow level two protection protocols. We must turn over the wards as soon as possible. Transform the ICU too. We are also short of necessary equipment right now. Personnel too. Come to my office. Copy, Director. Stop messing around. Experts believe. That the unexplained pneumonia's pathogen. Is indeed. A Novel Corona virus. Hurry! Speak. Zhang, We're sending all pneumonia patients to you right? Yes, Send them here, Send them all here. The ambulances keep on coming. Liu, I wanted to borrow some PPE from you. I'll get someone to send you some, We don't have much too. Got it, thank you. Calm down. Breathe slowly. 5ml of propofol. Prepare to intubate. Remove guidewire. Extension tube. Intubation can help the patient's lungs breathe. And increase the oxygen saturation in the blood. We'll just have to see whether his lungs. Can handle it. Son. Zhou Yong's mom and bed 9's patient. Passed away last night. On the 12th, the World Health Organization stated. That they have received. The genetic sequences of the Novel Corona virus. That was found through the unexplained pneumonia. Other countries can now open up more. Meaningful diagnoses. Regarding the Chinese investigation into the Novel Corona virus. And virus prevention work in Wuhan. The World Health Organization stated. That the quality is exceptional. Patient's blood oxygen levels are too low, I need some help! Extra bed 3 patient's blood oxygen has dropped below 90! Check source of oxygen. There are problems with the patients. Hurry up and use the breathing balloon! I'm Zhao Jinsheng from the ICU, We need oxygen tanks to be sent here. Director, There are too many people using oxygen at the moment. It has already far exceeded our designed capacity. Contact the manufacturers right now. Hurry. Quickly. You're in charge of this one, You're in charge of that one over there. Take a deep breath. But it's almost Chinese New Year. - Dear, - Honey, I've been feeling a little wheezy lately. You need to offer more, Pay whatever it takes to get more oxygen. When the price is right, someone is bound to help. Before you finish expanding the oxygen tanks. The oxygen supply must be refilled. Director Zhang, Hold on a second. Half of the hospital's cleaning and caretaking staff. Have just quit. I can't do this. I'll be home soon. I just quit, I'm coming home right now. Hello, honey? - We can't find... - I'm busy right now, I have to hang up. ...any tanks in the city. I'll call you back in a bit. Oxygen tanks are impossible to get right now. I don't want to listen to any of this, These are all just excuses. If my patients become hypoxic. And suffocate, This will be all on you. Director. Call a hospital wide meeting immediately. I have to tell the Director, We haven't solved our oxygen issue yet. And we admitted another 20 patients today. If we can't control the spread of this virus, We're throwing away the lives of over 10 million Wuhan citizens. If only I knew this would happen, I would have run like the others. What kind of nonsense is this. What did you say? Doctor Xin, Then why don't you anesthesiologists charge in first? Anesthesiologists? All departments should charge in. Sit, The director is here. It's okay. Sit down, we're about to start. Okay. Director, Our hospital. Cannot accept any other patients. We're already over budget with all the transformations. We're at full capacity. Keep on admitting them, Continue transforming different wards. Accept all patients. Let's begin. We may be a small infectious diseases hospital, But we are the first people to receive and. Treat the new pneumonia patients. From today onwards, Everyone from the administration department. Gear up with PPE. And clean up together with me. Party members, be on call 24 hours a day. The oath you swore when you joined. Will be put to the test right now. If anyone says I can't do this. I need to leave. That's fine. But don't even think about coming back. My fellow comrades, To protect our city, Protect our country, Protect our families, Everyone here. Has a responsibility to help. To give a little update. To everyone, Medical teams organized by the state. Will come and assist us in our efforts. As well as experts in the field, And a large amount of medical supplies, Will arrive soon. According to directives from up top, In our hospital, we have. Transformed two. ICU wards. But the problem is. The medical staff for the ICU wards. Are severely short handed. We will need support from all departments, Those. Who are pregnant. And those who have serious illnesses. Are the exceptions. Everyone else, I hope you can bravely step up and volunteer. Sign me up! - Sign me up too! - Director, I want to volunteer! Director, I want to volunteer as well! Thank you everyone. Thank you so much. Thank you. - Make sure to arrange all the beds and equipment. - Got it. Help everyone get familiarized with the environment. Notify the pharmacy, All medicine must be ready. Verify the amount. If there are is any question problem, speak out. At midnight, Wuhan's center for Novel Corona virus. Epidemic prevention and control. Issued the first notice. The notice states. In order to do well in our fight. Against the Novel Corona virus, We have to effectively eradicate virus transmission. And resolutely curb the spread of the virus. It's almost ready. The blood test is straight ahead. Get your IVs done towards the back. Director, there are too many patients. Do you think we should keep admitting more people? That is the principle we should work by. Two more of our healthcare workers. Have tested positive for Corona virus. Doctor, someone fainted. Don't push! Stop pushing! Listen to me, There are a lot of patients right now, Gather administration members of our hospital. And come help me maintain order. Come on, excuse me. Excuse me, let me through. - I'm going to go register, first. - Be careful. Wait for me, Stay here. Listen to me, For medical exams, go there to get your CT scans and blood tests. Hey, someone fainted here. - Doctor. - Doctor Wen, please come to the ICU as soon as possible. I'll be right there. My wife is pregnant, - Can you come help her? - Go line up first.

Doctor Wu, Wuhan's situation is pretty serious, You need to leave tonight. - To go help. - This urgent? Yes. Try to bring as much PPE with you as you can. Alright, got it. Tao Jun, We're still not completely sure about the situation in Wuhan. So, pay attention to your personal safety. And personal protection. You need to be careful, Doctor Tao.

Here, have some, Hard work today. No. Don't be like that. Isn't this what we signed up for. When we put on this uniform. Then can I not wear it? I've been here since December. I haven't been home. Do you know how long I haven't seen my parents? Look at my hands, Look at my face. Look at my face. Look at the faces around you, Their hands. We're all on the same boat. Who has been home. Since then? Who would want this? Look at the patients outside, Do you think they want to vomit? They're sick. If we don't care for them, Who will? We have to live up to our uniform, You understand? Her father tested positive, Couldn't get admitted. We need to go, Got to get to our next shift. Why don't you guys rest for a while longer? Then what's going to happen to the people inside. Let's go. We don't have any beds at the moment. What symptoms does he have? Director, can you help me? Do you have beds? We're full over here. Let me think of something. Director, The Health Commission has called. An emergency meeting. Hi honey, I've been feeling out of breath recently. So I went to. Get tested. Hey Liu, Do you have a spare bed over there? We're completely full here, I can't add anymore beds. Didn't you guys. Already transform new wards already? What do you need a bed for? It's alright, I'll ask the other hospitals. They're already here, I'm heading there right now. Go prepare first, We'll touch base soon. You guys are here. Director Zhang. You guys are here. Director Zhang, let me introduce. Doctor Tao from Guangzhou. Nice to meet you, Doctor Tao. This is Doctor Wu from Shanghai. Nice to meet you, Doctor Wu. I'm the Director of this hospital. My name is Zhang Jingyu. Director Zhang, Special times. You guys are finally here. Your arrival in Wuhan to assist us at this time. Is like. Receiving charcoal for warmth during winter. We've received orders from the Health Commission, Our newly converted ICU will be. Handed over to you. Unfortunately there is no time to rest. Sorry about that. You will have to work right away. Can you arrange it please? Alright, Director. Don't worry. Alright. - Where are you? - This way Doctor Tao, Doctor Wu. Alright, I'll come find you. Be careful everyone. Listen to me, We don't have anymore beds, Do you understand? Stop sending patients here, We can't admit anymore. This is our newly built ICU ward. All beds are currently occupied. There's no beds left. I'm sorry. So clumsy. This is our nurses station. Let me introduce you, This is our Chief Physician of Anesthesiology, - Doctor Xin Wei. - Hi. Anesthesiology? So what if I'm an anesthesiologist? Is there a problem? I'm Wu Chenguang from Shanghai. Hi, Not only anesthesiology, Dermatology and ENT departments are all here. That's the reality, Our patients are all here. Doctor! Blood pressure of patient in bed 22 is dropping quickly. - Go for it. - Take a look around. I administered 1 ml of vasopressors. Prep for CVC. Copy. Slow down! Wait a second. - Wear a face shield. - We're running out of them. You still need one! Let's get him up, careful. Hi, How are you? Mr. Zhang. I came here specifically from Guangzhou to help you. You can call me Tao. I'm here now, don't you worry, Okay? Okay. Yes, you'll be alright. Doctor, Patient on extra bed 3 needs help. 1ml of adrenaline. Get ready of defibrillation. 150 joules ready. Clear. Prepare for intubation. Connect infusion system. Copy. Everyone remain calm. Check equipment, Comfort your patients. It's okay, This is only temporary, - It'll all be okay. - Lights will come back on soon. This is only temporary, Please calm down. Only a temporary power outage. Calm down. Listen to me, The more nervous you are, The more difficult your breathing will be. - Calm down. - Administration? Power outage in the ICU. Contact general services now. Power outage in the ICU? Are you serious? Give it to me. What are you doing? Fix it, now! Free personnel in wards with power, We need help in the ICU. Stop. Stop. We're here to help, Where do you need us? - Here. - Copy that. Over there. Oxygen is needed over there. And there a patient being intubated over there. Go take a look. Don't be nervous, we'll have power soon. Doctor Yang, Blood oxygen dropping for extra bed 1. Patient... Needs to intubate. Copy. It's okay, Don't resist. Laryngoscope. What are you looking at? Intubate! Do it! Do it you punk. Let me. - Administer Propofol. - Doctor Wen, Copy, Propofol. Guide wire. Inflate. Be careful. Hurry up! Come on guys. Check the tanks. Are you okay? I'm okay. Oxygen, quick! Got it. Come here, Long. Tell your people to hurry up. Lives are at stake. The capacity is overloaded. We're switching to a second set of power supply now. The volunteers just arrived and this happens? What will they think of us? Doctor. Doctor, Patient on bed 6 is in shock, I need help at bed 6. Take over. Alright, let me. - What's going on? - Blood pressure is low. Why is the pulse pressure difference so big? He suffered blunt chest trauma before. We found out later he had pericardial effusion. Get me the ultrasound. Copy. Edema in throat. Prepare for tracheostomy. Copy. Get a pericardial puncture needle kit. We don't have any. CVC kit then. Alright, I'll go get it. We need draw out the excess fluid built up around the heart first, Otherwise, it will compress the heart. And affect the diastolic functions. In severe cases, patients can go into shock, Endangering him, you got that? Yes. You're lucky that I was here. Done. Doctor Tao. Extra bed 3 patient flat lined. Tracheostomy, We open up a director airway by making an incision in the trachea. We then insert the tracheal tube. Establishing an artificial airway. So the patient can breath. Increase oxygen concentration. How long since CPR started? 30 minutes. Resuscitation unsuccessful. Time of death, 21:38:40 Everyone, I want to know, Why we can't save these patients? Why? Because there is no cure. We know too little about this disease. There is no medication, We can only treat their symptoms, We can only treat whenever symptoms arise, To help them boost their. Immunity against the virus. This give us a fighting chance, But this virus is like a lunatic, Holding a gun to our patients. And firing uncontrollably. We can only be on the defensive. I believe early intubation. Can decrease the mortality rate. We need to shift our strategy, Intubate as soon as possible. Doctor Tao. Your patient that passed away the other day. Intubated early, How do you explain that? Once intubated, The airways expand, There are all kinds of bacteria in the ward, Making it easy to get infected. That patient. Died due to a bacterial infection. If we don't intubate, Some patients can still fight through. Once we intubate... A lot of patients suffer from severe hypoxia. When we intubate early, It increases the blood oxygen level. Only then can we maintain the patients organ functions, Only then the patient has a chance to recover. The risk of intubation is not solely the patients. When we enter the contaminated zone. We don't risk coming back out, Why? We're in there for 6 hour, Our masks are drenched, The effectiveness of our PPE drops dramatically, And we still have to intubate a patient in such close proximity. If medical personnel gets infected, How are we gonna face their families? If we intubate, We need to anaesthetize. The patient remains bedridden, In a deep coma, Even then we can't guarantee. If we can save that life. I've been thinking lately, Do I still deserve to be a doctor? I'm just gonna come out and say it. You experts... Were supposed to show some ability, But instead? Mortality rate is on the rise. I agree with what Director Zhang just said, Really, This small hospital is inept, No oxygen when you need it, Power outages in the ICU, Doctors are afraid to intubate. When the virus first began, You said yourself: Bring. All the patients here. At that moment did you consider. That the hospital's capabilities. Was up to par? There is nothing wrong with my hospital. Stand right there, Alright, I guarantee you. That from now on, there will be no power outages. That there will always be enough oxygen, But can you guarantee. You can decrease the mortality rate? I don't care where you're from, How prestigious your hospital is, If you're a big name expert, Or how many theses you published. The least you can do is pretend. To have the qualities of a practicing physician. I really can't stand those. Who gets discouraged. And disheartened easily. After setbacks. Comrades, The mortality rate. Is not improving, As doctors, We feel helpless, I know. My heart aches. I think everyone here. Feels the same way. You're Xiao Yang? Here's some roast goose. Promise me one thing though, Leave the ICU tomorrow, We don't have the time to make mistakes. Do you understand? On the first day of the Lunar New Year, The Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Called an important meeting regarding the epidemic. General Secretary of the CPC Xi Jinping. Hosted the meeting and pointed out important talking points. Give him the phone. Listen to your grandma, okay? Come on, of course not. Dad and I will come home as soon as we finish. I promise. Really. Don't cry, Mommy has to go to work. Damn this. Pandemic. My daughter is the same. Help! Don't be afraid. It's okay, don't be afraid. Relax. Help! Relax. Midazolam, 5mg. Bed 22 patient in critical condition, I need help. I'm here. Doctor, his blood hasn't been coagulating properly since this morning. Prepare to administer adrenaline. Bed 15. I need help at bed 15. Pushing adrenaline. Hang in there. This is a new patient with Uremia. He hasn't received a dialysis for over a week. Did we check his blood potassium level? Yeah we checked. The results of the AT value is in. Normal. Calcium gluconate and sodium bicarbonate. Copy. Go ahead, I'm in the room, what is it? Doctor, patient in extra bed 9 has vomited blood. Be right there. Come on, spit it out. What's going on? Spit it out, don't swallow, spit it out. Open your mouth, open wide, spit it. No heart rate. Get a crash cart. Right lung has collapsed, Hurry and extract. Pump air. Unsynchronized cardioversion activated. Clear. Doctor Wen, I've been. Coughing lately. And feeling out of breath. Do you think I've been infected? Doctor Wen, I'm sorry, It feels like. It's getting a lot more serious. Do you guys. Have any spare beds? Doctor Wen, Don't forget. You still have packages here. When this is over, Remember. To come get it. Patients are not being admitted. So they run from hospital to hospital. Those healthy are getting sick, Those sick are getting worse. Families. Who don't have the means to self quarantine. Are infecting the rest of the family. We need to prevent this and find the patients. We also need to concentrate the severe cases into designated hospitals to save them. The State is constantly revising their diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control plans. There are lots of units, Make sure not to miss any. Name and phone number? Start from this building. Have you travelled anywhere in the last 7 days? No. Didn't go anywhere. No. Check her temperature. Come here kid. We're going to check your temperature. The National Health Commission. Has dispatched medical personnel. From all around the country. Actually, let's not say dispatched, But rather our comrades, Our countryman. Bringing medical equipment, PPE. And determination to help Hubei and Wuhan. Let's go Wuhan! Designated hospitals. Must add new wards as soon as possible. One hospital bed doesn't only represent a single patient, It represents an entire family, It's the key to stability for society. What you need, we give. Who you need, we send. Anything you need, the country will give. But there is one requirement, We need to put the patients. First. Photo time! Come on! Masks! Stay strong. Thank you for your hard work. It's very pretty. Thank you. Wear your masks. General Secretary of the CPC called a meeting with the Politburo Standing Committee. To organize the fight against the pandemic. He created a task force. To unify leadership and command. And to make sure pandemic prevention work is done well. Grandpa, is dad... -...coming back soon? - There will be an open, transparent. - Yes. - And a responsible attitude. Should be soon. To consistently update the world on information about the virus. And actively responding to concern from all. As well as elevating cooperation with the international community. Hello, we are with the epidemiology team, Do you have any symptoms? Like coughing and difficulty breathing? Are there spare beds now? Hurry and pack a bag, We're going to the hospital. Hold on, How many people live here? Just my husband and I, He works in the hospital, Hasn't been home in a while. Alright, hurry up and pack. Okay. Sir, please go back. - Let me send her. We'll do that. - We'll do that. Please stay inside. Jin, If you dare take any delivery orders behind my back, No one can save you. I won't. Wait for us to come back. Okay. Let's go. I'll be waiting for you and the baby. Be careful. I am Director Zhang, I hope you could donate your mother's body. For science. What kind of doctor are you? - She's already dead, - Relax, calm down, please. Now you want to cut her open? Director Zhang. Did you. Get yelled at again? Yeah, But I can take it. If. I don't make it, You can use my body. For research. Hey, hey, Look at you talking like this again. Honey, Trust the treatment. Get back to work, I'm gonna hang up. Doctor Tao. Zhang Jixing's blood oxygen level has dropped to 89. I'll be right over, Prepare for intubation. Again? Of course. Not only will I intubate, I'll also extubate. So he can leave this place alive. Let's go! I was just about to call my wife. Let's not! Hey Zhang, Hold on. Your blood oxygen is too low right now. I don't want it, I don't want this. Your blood oxygen is only 92. If you don't put it on your baby will suffocate. Let me see. She doesn't need any medicine yet. Okay. Aren't you the doctor. Who was unwilling to save me? Can I switch? There aren't any others. Your baby is okay. The WHO has declared. That the Novel Corona virus. Has become a public health emergency of international concern. Now we wait for them to send out a team. For a joint investigation. The crucial point now to see if the report. Will send out recommendations for trade and travel advisories to us. Not only Wuhan, But Hubei have already come to a halt. This country has already paid a substantial price. It's good they're coming, Let them see for themselves. Breathe, nice and easy. Look here. Xiao Wen, Breathe. - Intubate. - Copy. Relax. Blood oxygen still not improving. Increase oxygen concentration. I want to put Xiao Wen on ECMO. Put her on when she fits the criteria. You called us in. To discuss this? What is there to discuss? If she responds well to the ECMO, I hope we can carry out a Caesarean for her, So that she can give birth to her baby. You want do a cesarean section on a. COVID-19 patient who is on ECMO? Help her. The mother's condition will improve after birth. Xiao Wen's heart and lungs are functioning very weakly. The birth will alleviate the. Burden and stress put on the mother. - I agree. - I don't. Even if the ECMO surgery is a success, When we get to the operating room, With her current vitals, Will her body even handle the anesthetic, That I'll administer? If anything goes wrong on that table, Who's to blame? Me, I'm the anesthesiologist. If we delay this any longer, She'll get an infection. Due to internal bleeding. And the baby will die. I don't agree with the c-section. If the surgery goes wrong, It's two deaths on our hands, not one. This is a huge responsibility. I understand. So what you're saying is. If we do nothing and Xiao Wen dies, She'll just be another statistic. But if we help her and she dies, We'll be scapegoated? Scapegoated? If someone dies everyone will be to blame. We're also an infectious disease hospital, We'll have to hire an outside obstetrician to help us. Right now, Who would be willing to take that risk? She's healthy. Is there another doctor? What kind of doctors are you? My wife is pregnant. How could you ignore us? These are two lives. Hi Mom, Is your hip feeling better? I joined a community group chat. That sells vegetables. There's going to be someone delivering soon. Oh! And I saw your hospital on TV. I tried looking for you but I couldn't. If there's a chance next time, Make sure to stand in the front. Alright, I will let you get back to it. Don't worry about grandma and grandpa, I will take care of them. Mom, Love you. Remember, you're a great doctor. As the first person responsible, We will be penalized severely, Our reputation. Will be tarnished. I just want the patient to be. Able to live the life she planned. When this pandemic blows over, Life still carries on. I understand. Why are we putting Xiao Wen on ECMO? Her lung has been infected by the virus. And lacks oxygenation capabilities. Which can lead to hypoxia. And why do people say that ECMO. Is the best tool for COVID patients? Because it replaces the functions of the lung. After we prep. We will insert tubing into her femoral vein and internal jugular vein. The ECMO then draws the patient's blood from the femoral vein. And through an extracorporeal artificial lung, It then absorbs oxygen while. Expelling carbon dioxide. The oxygenated blood is then transported back into the patient through the internal jugular vein, Then her condition will immediately improve. What does ECMO stand for? You say it. What does it stand for? Look it up! We've looked into the situation. After she's put on ECMO, We'll do a c-section once she stabilizes. Doctor Huang, On behalf of the patient's unborn child, I would like to thank you. It's alright. During this pandemic, you can stop everything. But not the cycle of life. We will face this. Together. Thank you. Oh no, The artery is pierced. She has such thin vessels, And it's so close to the jugular vein. I'll get the ultrasound. He's finally starting to get it. Try it on my side, I'll help you keep pressure on it. You do it. Alright. Anaesthetize. 2500 RPM. Fetal heart rate is down to 85. Fetal heart rate is way too low, If we wait until we get to the operating room, I'm afraid it might be too late! Director Huang, I don't think we can move her, We should operate here. Okay. Let's start. The baby's not in the right position, Still not right. Birth successful. Surgery complete. Hi, Honey. I thought you could only call at night? Being a mother. Is not easy. What's wrong? I love you. Thank you. I love you too. Hello. Your child's test results came back, Negative. Thank you! Xiao Wen's condition is stable. Oh right, About last time. I'm very sorry. I was too anxious. I'll pay the medical fees, - As soon as possible. - No need, Expenses are covered. By the country. Thank you! Here. Everyone's in Wuhan is giving their all, Makes moments like these worth everything. As my life is slowly counting down, This little baby's is. Only beginning. Amazing. My attitude towards you. Wasn't great the other day, I sincerely apologize. Haven't had much sleep recently, Here, to wake up. What happened to your leg? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. When it first started, This leg was really stiff. I just thought I was tired. The day I was diagnosed, My wife, Cried for the whole day. I cried too. This sickness is a pain in the ass. After another four, five years. I won't be able to walk without help. I won't be able to eat without help. I won't be able to talk. I'll be a vegetable. I'm sorry. I was afraid of this reaction. So I never really told anyone about it. I'd rather people say. That guy is tough, I need to surpass him, I need to beat him. Why did you tell me? Ever since you arrived, You had that type of attitude. The baby's heart is stable. We must try our best to meet. Every patient's needs. We must attentively take care of them. Everything ready. Hey! It's your turn. Take it. It doesn't matter how many times you practice on a dummy, If you can't intubate a real patient at a moment's notice, The patient dies. This food won't do, Not enough nutrition. The breakfasts have to have at least two eggs. If the patients have enough nutrition, Their bodies can fight and. Resist the virus. Only intubated. Will he have a chance to survive. Relax. The kid's improving a lot. The mortality rate is still rising. We must find a breakthrough, And lower the death rate. She's already 82 years old. Has high blood pressure and diabetes, a bunch of basic illnesses. Make sure to keep measuring her vitals. Alright. Don't worry, Doctor. It's standard. Not bad. Most patients over 60. Already have common ailments. Such as heart diseases, Diabetes, hyphenation and the like. When these patients are hospitalized, A lot of them. Develop respiratory failure. Which is very difficult. For us to treat. Is your care and treatment up to standard? Yes, they are. We usually establish an airway through intubation. But, as the infection worsens, Some people go into shock, Some go into. Acute renal failure. And others develop coagulation disorders. Essentially, these patients are dying from. Multiple organ failures. Are you intubating at the right times? I think that our treatment shows. That we are. I suggest you incorporate Chinese medicine into your treatment. Right now the disease has not been controlled yet. Our Job now, Is not only to lower the mortality rate. It's also to let patients. Recover from the hospital. Are you the delivery guy? I'm not taking orders right now. I said I'm not taking any orders. It's me again, so sorry. My parents have heart issues and. We're out of medicine. We're also out of milk powder, Can you please help me? I'll put in a big tip, is that okay? There are elderly and the young, If I get sick then. The entire family is screwed. It's dangerous for me too! I'm scared as well. Find someone else. The X-ray on my right shows Zhang Jixing's CT when he was first admitted. And this one on my left, is this morning. His lung infections have improved a lot. Not only that, His oxygen index has also drastically improved. It's been improving the past few days. It's past 300. As of this morning. I want to extubate him. Zhang, We are going to extubate you now. Try to relax, okay? Vacuum sputum. Copy. If this intubation is successful, This would be Wuhan's first. Successful one. During the Corona virus pandemic. Zhang, Can you cough for me? Zhang, Can you cough for me? Zhang. Cough. Try to cough. Breathe, Zhang. Breathe. You're awesome! Thank you. Uncle, Do you like today's food? Yes, Can I get another? Yes. You can have as many as you want. I'll bring you another one when you finish. Okay. Uncle, Here. Eat slowly, We have plenty. Don't rush. Zhang, Your vitals have been great these past few days. Couple more days, you'll be home. Having dinner with your wife and kids. Amazing. Yes, We are all amazing. Temperature check. It's normal? Yes. Right here! Stand back a little. I'll hang the formula here. Alright. Stand back a little more. Thank you! I really appreciate it. Thank you. Bye. Stay safe! Your Chinese medicine is ready. Alright, thank you. Here you go. Got it, thank you. Auntie. Where should I put your. Groceries and medicine? Right there is okay! Thanks. My daughter is born. Guys! My daughter is here. After this pandemic, I'm taking everyone out for drinks. Sounds good! We're going to beat this pandemic. Let's go! Let's go Wuhan! At 2:16 AM, Zhang Jixing. Died of myocardial infarction. Zhang. Couple more days. You'll be home. Having dinner with your wife and kids. Yes, We are all amazing. They're both gone. I'll go. This is Zhang Jixing's next of kin. Thanks. No problem. Are you Zhang Jixing's and Zhao Ruzhen's daughter? Zhang Xiaofeng? These. Are your parents belongings. If you ever need someone to talk to, You can call me. Anytime. Uncle, All I want to know is. What is life like. Without parents? Why? On our second day here. I wrote 2 wills. One for my wife, One for my daughter. I gave the letter that I wrote to my daughter to Zhang Jixin's daughter. It was the right thing to do right? Because all dads are the same. Dad love you, Dad hopes you can live a long healthy life. I didn't lie to her right? I don't think it does. Let me see the letter you wrote to your wife. Give it back. What are you doing? Wake up! Your wife doesn't want this, What she wants is you. She wants you to get home safe and sound. I... I really wanted to save them, But... But I couldn't. Zhang, Rest in peace. We're completely unclear on the origins, Development and transmutations of the virus. This will definitely affect how we treat it. So we wish to. Perform autopsies. On patients. Of course, This will require relevant personnel. To communicate with. The deceased relatives. And get their approval. I'll go. I think we should let. Doctor Tao go this time. My grandfather agreed, But I don't. I thought. I could have seen my grandma one last time. Now no one can. No one... When my grandmother died, She had no one by her side. When I was young, My parents. Would send me to my grandparents when I was sick. I had a patient. And I. From intubation to extubation, His tests were coming back negative already. I thought he was okay. In the end, he still passed away. My mistake was I thought I would win. But I realized that developments in medicine. Are built on failures. It's only through. These failures. That we adjust our treatments, So that the next patient can have a chance to live. I know what I'm saying right now. Is very unfair for the. Deceased. And their families. But this is the truth. I wasn't your grandmother's primary doctor, But I can promise you this, When she left us. She was not alone. I'm not going to pressure you. Besides, Ever since I've been here, I've seen too many failures. We. Need to record you, For evidence. I agree. I'm sorry, Grandma. I decided, I hope you agree. General Secretary of the CPC.
