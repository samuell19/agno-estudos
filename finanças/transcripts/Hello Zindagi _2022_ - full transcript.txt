[SANSKRIT VERSE] [SANSKRIT VERSE] Oh Sun God, Disha is my only daughter. - [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Disha is so lost in this virtual world, that... ...she is not aware of this world's beauty. Oh Lord, please do us such a favour that... ...my Disha realizes the true beauty of this world. [SANSKRIT VERSE] [TYPING SOUND] Shubhangi, why did you like Pooja's pic? Unlike it immediately... ...and like and comment on my morning post. Wow, beautiful butterfly. Do it right now, bye. Nisha, dear. Coming, father. [LAUGHS] This is for you, this is for me... ...this is for you... Hey, Nisha! Atleast see whether there is tea in this or not, where is the tea? It is empty. Look outside your mobile for sometime atleast. Do you even know what is happening in the outer world? Sorry father. What sorry? Do you know... ...yesterday when I was doing yoga, a crowd of people thrashed a young man... - ...just because of the mobile. - Because of the mobile? - Yes. That young man was texting and running... ...and in front of him a fat lady was also running... - ...that lady got tired, started panting so she stood... - [MESSAGE RECEIVED TONE] ...and this young man banged into her... ...that lady yelled... ...help, help he is molesting me. And the crowd of people caught the young boy, and thrashed him. It's good that I glanced upon it... I made people understand and saved him... ...or, he would had to go to jail... ...because of this mobile. [LAUGHS] - Haha. - Hey, dear... I am telling you. I agree that... ...this mobile is a necessity today... It is a good invention of scientists... ...but it does not mean... ...because of that we cannot enjoy the beauty of this world. Do you know. Dear... ...nature has given so much beauty to this world... ...and you, are missing that beauty... ...because of this mobile. Miss? No father... ...everything we want is in this phone. Connect to our friends, family, education, payment... ...online classes and all. A whole world on your finger tip, father. Come on, I will drink my juice upstairs... ...my online classes are about to begin. Oh my God! [GASPS] Ma'am, my father has dengue... ...so I have not completed the assignments. Dengue? When did I have dengue? And ma'am doctor has said, if he does not get fine today... ...then he will have to be shifted on the ventilator. - [AMBULANCE SIREN] - Is this my daughter? Ma'am, I think father will have to be shifted to the ventilator immediately... ...ma'am, bye. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I think I will have to get a ventilator in this house. Sorry father, I had not completed the assignments that is why. But, grandmother has expired... ...you should have made her fall sick... ...why are you making me fall sick? But I made her die six months ago. Means, now I am the only person alive in this house? So now you want me dead also? Father, sorry. Drink this juice, and complete your assignment. - I am opening the door. - Yes. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Oh wow... ...so my Vardaan peanut oil has arrived? Thank you, you have a very fast service, - Okay. [CAMERA CLICK] Why hasn't Disha come as yet? I had told you to call her half an hour early. I had given her one hour prior... ...she must be coming. Here, she comes. Hi friends! Sorry I am a bit late. Wait. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What are you doing? Shivang, give me the DSLR. You got your photos clicked. See, Dishu... ...right now, this is trending. I have sent the list of this on Whatsapp, okay? And this is a digital marketing company... ...which will post for you daily and increase your views and followers. Wow. Yo! You click photos. I am worried about, Disha... How much busy as she is in this mobile world... ...she is beyond the real world. She does not understand what this world is. I don't understand how will I get her back in this real world. Whatever she does from morning to evening... ...she updates it on the net immediatly. The whole world comes to know what she must be doing right now. Do you want to know? [BIRDS CHIRPING] See, right now she is eating a burger at a coffee shop with one of her friends. This is her post 3 minutes ago. You sit and explain to her calmly. I tried very hard yo make her understand, but... ...instead she makes me understand... ...and if I tell her her more, she gets angry. She tell me, father you will not understand this matter. You take her out once... ...and explain the importance of it to her. And because of that her mind will also change... ...and she will get information also. Yes. This is a good idea. I will tell her today itself that dear, we will... ...go on a one day picnic to a good place. Good idea. Rohit... - Rohit, no. - Disha... ...beware if you do anything... ...or I will also cut the vein on my hand, Rohit no. - Disha! Father, you spoilt my audition. Audition? Yes father, I have to make an audition for a web series. Oh, is this an audition? I got so stressed. Anyway, come down to eat food. I am waiting for you on the dining table. Disha, dear. - Yes father? - Come here, dear. - Sit. - Yes, say father? Dear... Disha... ...don't you think you are wasting your precious time? No, father... I am doing what I like, so what? Then, this acting... ...audition what is all this? I knew... ...that he would not have liked it. But I want to learn acting, father. See, dear... ...if you like acting and want to learn it, no problem... ...but, if you are doing it to praise your unreal world, then that is wrong. Father. No, I really want to learn acting. And if mother was here she would have supported me, not like you. See dear, it is not like that... ...if you really like acting, you learn... I don't mind, but... ...do acting with honesty and think of it as your work. Did you understand, dear? Okay, if you don't like what I am saying... I will not say it, I will tell you some other nice thing. Tomorrow we will go to a nice place for a one day picnic. - What did you say, picnic? - Picnic. - Yes. - And you? Yes. Forget it.

Disha, you have shut the alarm fifth time till now. Father, it's at just 7:00 o'clock. That is why I am waking you up. And listen, from today you have to come... ...for yoga and morning walk... ...with me everyday, understand? - No way, father. - Disha! Father, fast. - See, so much speed. - Okay, fast. Slow, slow not so much. Look, follow this. - Do we have to see everything in the mobile and do - Yes. You are slow again, come on, hurry up. Okay, I am fast, fine? [GASPS] Oh! What are you doing? Father, I am measuring water in this... ...so that I know how much water to drink in the whole day. Look in the mobile and drink water? "Om." Father, look at this application... ...if we follow this, we will be able to finish our meditation fast. It will channelize. [MESSAGE RECEIVED TONE] Father, surprise for you. Surprise for me? [BACKGROUND MUSIC] Wow, what a car! Yes. [CAMERA CLICKS] Hello, life. Thank you so much, father. You are welcome, my princess. - Love you. - Love you too, dear. Come on, we will take a selfie with the car. Ah! Dear, when you upload this photo, write a caption below... ...new car and trip, gifted from my father. Trip? - Where are we going? - Not us, dear... ...you are going alone. You, want to become a model and actress, right? Then you will have to agree to this condition of mine. Condition? Yes. Condition. You have to go on a trip for a few days where I tell you to go. After you come back from there... ...you become a model or a heroine... I have no problem. - Really, father? - Yes. Is this your condition? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Have you got fever? - Then you are worlds best father. - That I am. But dear, you have to agree to my second condition... ...that the trip you are going on, you will not take your cell phone with you. That you will have to give me... ...and you will have to take this phone with you... ...so that we can stay in touch, okay? Really, father? What? No, no. This is impossible. A trip without a cell phone? No. Then your, modelling and acting cancel. Father. Yes. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Look, dear... ...whatever stuff you need, I have packed in your bag... ...and put the bag in the car. Okay, now if you need... ...then stay in touch with me through this phone, okay? This phone? Yes dear, this phone is simple like me. It is not as smart as you. This is called a junk phone. But father, why not my smart phone? Dear, you will have to find the answer to your why on your own, okay? - Okay. - Hurry up and sit in the car... ...you will be late for your picnic, okay? Sit. All the best. - Thank you, father. - Enjoy your trip. Go carefully, dear... ...and call me once you reach. [ENGINE REVVING] Sun God, please take care of my daughter.

Why are you calling him stupid, his name is Coffee. And how did you have the guts to kick him? He is a cute little puppy. Then keep your puppy to yourself... ...why have you left him wandering? He is spoiling all my expensive things. [CHUCKLES] Nonsense, expensive stuff! It's all duplicate cheap stuff. Hey, my stuff is not duplicate. They are all branded.

Yes, good boy. [LAUGHS] Come on, Coffee. Yes, good boy Coffee. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey Chotu, where is the fort here? Ahead, above. - Is this the fort? - Yes. Is this the fort? This is called ruins. - [HUMMING] - I'm tired. There is nothing like a fort here. These stones and a green pond. Where did father send me? Okay since I am here let me click some pictures, what else can I do? [GASPS] See Coffee, it's such a lovely pond... ...wow, it's such a lovely historical place. But some people don't understand. Go to hell, you are bothering me since such a long time. [WAVES SPLASHING] Wow. Bow! [LAUGHS] Bloody donkey, mokey, God knows where is coming from again and again. Got scared, Miss chapati! [RETCHES] Brother make me a dish, and get me lemon juice before that. We don't have lemon juice. Then do you have lemon? Yes. Okay, please give it. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yes father, I am going to see the waterfall right now. What has happened to your voice, dear? Why is your voice heavy? Nothing father, I vomitted on the road, so... I am drinking lemon juice. What did you say, dear? Hello. Hello. Yes father, seems like there is signal problem here, hello. Hello. Yes, I am saying... I am drinking lemon juice, I vomitted on the way here. Oh no, dear see... ...do one thing, drink water... ...and don't drink eat immediatly after drinking water, okay. Hmm. Okay father, I will eat later on. Take care, okay. [WATER SLOSHING] [SIGHS] If you don't look in the right direction there could be an accident. The view is so beautiful... ...but people are lost in photos. Whatever! Hmm. "Om." Where are you Coffee? Where is Coffee? Where is my dear Coffee? Where is Coffee? Oh wow, how much is this for? 80 rupees. 80 rupees? Take it, it's cheap. Yes, it's cheap, for creativity like this... I will pay 100 rupees, pack four for me. Come on, Coffee do you want something? Do you want to eat fruit? How much is this fruit for, aunty? One for 10 rupees. 10 rupees, give me one. That's it, just one? I would buy 5. Why only 5, buy the whole shop. Yes, I can buy it, I will buy it. Pack it, that and all this. I will get my wallet and come. Oh no. - Where is my purse? - Look Coffee... ...look at her, she is really emptying her car to keep the goods. Come on, she is a psycho, mobiholic. Come on my Coffee, my baby, good boy. Run, run. Weirdo, where has he come from? Maybe this is the eating place. Excuse me... I had come here sometime ago, have you seen my wallet anywhere? No, I haven't seen it. Then which eating place was it? [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WATER SLOSHING] Excuse me, doggy lover... Who is it? Oh you! Don't you remember his name? Yes I remember, Coffee. Hmm. By the way... I am looking for the way to go the resort. Will you help me? What? Help, did you say a word like help? Yes, will you help me? You have so much money... ...go out from here and go to any resort... ...and stay there only. - I don't have the money. - [CROW CAWING] What did you mumble? Nothing, you just show me the way to get out of this jungle. Okay, which resort do you want to go to? My resort. Does your father own a resort? Hey, talk properly. Mine, means the resort I am staying. Okay, your resort must be having a name, right? That's what I don't remember. But, it was on a hill. Okay, do one thing, go straight... ...then take a right turn... ...then left right, then right then left then right then left left and right. Okay? Okay, thanks. Go. See, here is my soup and here are your biscuits. Now both of us will freshen up and come... ...and then we will eat. Coffee is good, Coffee is very good. Coffee's bowls. I had put it here and gone. Oh! Where are they? Where did they disappear? Coffee, looks like we have forgotten the bowls there only. Come, let's get it. Hey you, Miss chapati! You drank my soup and ate Coffee's biscuits! Were they dog biscuits? Hey not dog, Coffee! You should not have eaten Coffee's biscuits. Now I will not spare you! - No, no. - You wait! - No. - Wait! Sorry, sorry. Sorry, I was very hungry, sorry. Huh! [FOOTSTEPS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Sorry, Kartik. It's okay. What happened? Didn't you find your resort? No. How will you find it also? If you knew the name you would find it. What should I do? I cannot see anything else beside mountain and trees. And I vomited on my way back, I did not anything also. And what did I get to eat, Coffee's biscuit? And I lost my purse also. And this old phone, which does not even have network. If I had my smart phone, I would have put it on the map and searched. Because of these smart phones, people have stopped using their brains. You know, and a smart phone is to make your work simple... ...not to depend on it. Stop your lecture, scholar. You have a smart phone, give it to me. [WATER SLOSHING] Here is my expensive smart phone. "Expensive smart phone!" There is no network. Did you see, I had told you... ...there is nothing here besides trees and mountains. These are not called trees... ...they are called 'G' trees. Means? Means, they are called pepper trees. But, pepper trees... Let it be, don't use your brains so much... ...see, no problem if you had my soup... ...ate Coffee's biscuits, even then I am telling you... ...that it will be dark in sometime... ...stay if you want. Or, see as you wish. Okay. [BONFIRE] I am feeling sleepy, Coffee and I are going inside to sleep. Then where will I sleep? Inside. But there is just one bed. Yes, so I had no plans to become two from one. You sleep on one side, I will sleep on the other side. Uhh! This is the only option otherwise go and sleep in your car. Yes, good option. You and Coffee go in the car, switch on the AC or the heater... ...and I am going inside the tent to sleep. No way, hey I am not going to sleep in your car. Yeah. Bye-bye, goodnight. This tent is mine, and I will sleep in the tent only. [DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] [SNORING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Ahh! First my soup went, then your biscuits went... ...and now this tent also. "The climate today." Oh, wow. The smell is very good. What have you made? 'Thepla', wow. You pounce on food as soon as you see it, atleast wash your mouth first. Go. Coffee! Come, dear... [BIRDS CHIRPING] I also want to go here. Is this your next destination? Yes. Father has given me a list... ...in that this is the next location. You just do one thing... ...you tell me the way to get out of here... ...then you will also get a vehicle from there. You are so selfish. I gave you place to sleep in the night... ...gave you 'thepla' to eat, and in the night you peeled the peanuts and ate them... ...and the whole night I slept in an uncomfortable... ...position in your car, and poor Coffee got so troubled... ...and you have a problem in giving me a lift? How did you sleep? 'Tutyu' What is 'tutyu?' Like this, this is called 'tutyu' Whatever, I'm Disha, and... ...thanks for everything, I have no problem in giving you a lift... ...but I don't like your dog. I hate animals. Oh shit! - How can I be so stupid, dude! - What happened? Diesel is over. Ahh! Oh no! You roam in such a big car, don't you know you have to fill diesel, fool! Don't call me a fool... I had filled diesel... ...but because I roamed a lot yesterday... ...that is why the diesel got over. Wait, the whole night, you... ...slept with the heater on, right? That is why the diesel got over. I did not do it happily... ...last night I could not sleep because of your snoring... I was scared that a wild animal should not come to wake us up. Shut up, what should we do now, say that. We will ask for a lift. Come on. [GASPS] It is all your fault. What did I do? How will we get help like this? Then why are you standing? You ask for a lift. See a tractor is coming, now see how I ask for a lift. Hey brother, stop. What happened? Is your car spoilt? No, the diesel is over. Oh. There are no petrol pumps far and wide here. Do one thing, my house is close by... ...and I will send my son to get diesel... ...till then you'll rest. Hmm. Okay. Come on, sit. Come on, keep driving slowly. Welcome, this is my house. Why do you get Coffee everywhere? He is my best friend. But to someone else's house? Freshen up, food is ready. Vijubhai. We are very hungry. - No problem, food is ready. - Hey. What? Will you sit and eat like this? Yes. Not like that... We came here suddenly, now look at their house... ...whether they must have cooked the food or... ...not, and you said yes at once without looking? You should have said no once. Disha, you are right... ...but people in the village might have very small houses... ...but they have very large hearts. These people always make extra food... ...and even if there isn't enough, they know how to share and eat. Okay, come on now... ...freshen up, I am very hungry. Kartik, why do keep him near me you know I don't like it. Disha, he likes you. Forget your scare once and try and play with him once atleast. You will really enjoy. My lovely cutie-pie Coffee. Touch. Good boy. Disha... ...the more you love dumb animals, its less. If you love them a little you will get ten fold love back. That is really true. Oh, Vijubhai... ...what happened about the diesel? It will be arranged till evening. Okay Vijubhai, where are you going right now? I have some work at in the farm, come if you want. Okay, come on. What 'vadi?' 'Vadi', farm. - Farm. - Oh, farm. Come on. This is my farm. All this millet has to be harvested. Vijubhai, can I try? Yes, please try. Here Disha, hold him. Hmm! Hold. Just pull the plant like how these people are doing. See this. Now that you have stayed so much... ...watch the legendary story narrative in the night and leave in the morning. Is there a legendary story narrative in the village? Yes. Oh, wow. Disha, I have heard that the narrative legendary... ...story is very good and it is really worth watching. In our city, there is no longer anything like a narrative legendary story. This is called a cultural heritage. I wish to see it. [FOLK SONG] [FOLK SONG] [FOLK SONG] [FOLK SONG] [FOLK SONG] [FOLK SONG] Oh Saint, wake up. Oh sister, he is not waking up. [FOLK SONG] Who has broken my penance? Who is it? Please forgive me. I am an 'Apsara' from Lord Indra's kingdom. Whoever you are, I am cursing you... ...that on earth in Sorath village... ...you will be born in a native class... ...and you will get a black, small, lame husband, go... I am cursing you. Saint. If you are cursing me... ...then I am also cursing you... ...that lame, black, ugly, you will only become my husband, go. Narayan, this is like a sheep went to eat cotton and kept the wool. [INAUDIBLE] We have to get you married, it's your marriage. - Means what do I have to do? - That you will find out right now. - To get married. - Means, what do I have to do? [FOLK SONG] Understand mother, do you know? [INDISTINCT] You are married to my daughter. - Four rounds around the fire are done. - Is that what happened? Oh, she got married to you. Son, don't make her unhappy at all, okay? And yes, there should be no complain about you. There will definitely be complains. What do you mean by that? The complain will id that I cannot work. Why? I cannot do hard work... ...and she will have some problem to eat. No, no I have raised my daughter... ...she should not have any trouble at all. See if there is a complain, I will tie you up. Don't worry, your daughter is as good as my daughter. Hey, what are you saying? Then what should I say? Aren't you ashamed, she is called your wife. Aren't you ashamed, she is called your wife. Kartik, I don't understand one thing. Just one? You don't understand a lot, Disha. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Don't look at me in such a scary way. Come on, say. What don't you understand in the middle of the night? I don't understand you at all. You tell me, we did so many activities during the entire day today... ...we learnt so many new things, but you... ...don't upload on any social media. If I was in your place... ...and if I had my beautiful smart phone... ...then I would have shared so much, uploaded so much... ...there would have been so many likes and comments. I miss all that, dude. Seriously? I don't click photo's to upload or to show anyone else. Those are my memories... ...which I have lived, simple. But don't you feel like sharing something? People see your photos and say something about them. They let you know... ...and you make new friends, and you know all that. In your virtual world... ...there are no true friends... ...and some people just forward goodnight and... ...good morning messages to maintain relations. They upload all the activities right from I am... ...visiting this place, till I am meeting them. And because of that only, the places they visit... ...whatever they eat, cannot be enjoyed. And do you know the most foolish matter I feel is... ...when people don't get likes and comments... ...they get into depression. And they get into so much depression, that they are motivated to commit suicide. Then, what is happiness for you? For me? Look, around you... ...no luxury, nothing... ...then also these people are so happy. This is called a happy and contented life. The proverb that guests are a form of God... ...you can see that here. Why are you smiling? Go to sleep, and let me also sleep. [GASPS] Crazy woman. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Kartik, where is Coffee? Hmm! Isn't Coffee here? - No. - Coffee! There is no coffee only tea. Coffee! Coffee! Vijubhai, did you see Coffee? Yes, I got coffee from the shop. Not that coffee, my dog Coffee. Your Coffee, I haven't seen him since morning. - Oh no, have the village dogs eaten him? - What? Come on. Coffee! Have you seen my small dog? Coffee! Coffee! Coffee! Coffee! [SOBBING] "From my eyes." "Tears flow." "Your talks on my lips." "In my hands." "There are no lines, but." "I want to live with you." "You come back." "You come back." "All the happiness of my life" "I will give you." "I am your soul." "You are my breathe." "To live with you." "Is a matter of luck." "Is a matter of luck." "You arrange the planets of my life." "You come back." "You come back." "You come back." "Tears flow from my eyes." Coffee! "Your talks on my lips". "There are no lines in the hands, but" "I want to live with you." "You come back." "You come back," Coffee! "You come back." "You come back." "You come back." "You come back." "You come back." Coffee". "You come back." "You come back." [LAUGHS] Isn't he very cute? Yes, your Coffee is very cute. By the way Kartik, what do you do, and where do you stay? My father has a very big business. My mother is no longer alive... ...but my dad is only my life. I'm sorry. I also have a beautiful smart phone. But father put a condition, that if I want to complete my dreams... ...then I should leave my smart phone behind and go for a trip. [CHUCKLES] I don't know why father feels like I don't take my life seriously. He thinks I am yet a baby. Kartik, I am only talking since such a long... ...time, you also say something about yourself. About me? I have two legs, two hands... - ...one... - Shut up, Kartik. [LAUGHS] Okay, I am also from Ahmedabad... ...and I have a family business of fruit juice. Oh, so you have a fruit juice stall? Which extracts juice, right? Oh, it's a company. Okay. But I don't understand one thing about you. What? How can you wander around like a Fakir? No place to stay, no proper food, you eat wherever you get food... ...you sleep where you get to sleep, without a luxurious life. Without car, how is this possible, dude? How are you doing all this? Hey Disha see, my family is well settled... ...and I don't have any kind of attachment. I want to explore the world... ...and I don't think that whatever I want to feel, I need any luxuries for that. Hmm. Then what is that you want to feel? Everything that is there in this nature. [LAUGHS] Turn ahead from here. But we have to go straight. I know, but it's my new plan. New plan, but how can you plan so suddenly? See Disha, we always... ...plan and go on a trip, but when we go on a trip out of the box... ...without planning, then golden memories are written in the diary of our life. Will you tell me where are we going? [HUMMING] My car, my trip and I only don't know where are we going. - Oh my God, 'Ubadiyu'. - Where? Oh not a mouse, 'Ubadiyu' something to eat. Stop here, okay. Stop, stop. Yes. Eat spicy food, go early in the morning. [BIRDS CHIRPING] But what do eat it with? You eat it just like that. - Ah! - I will not eat. What don't you want to eat it? Ahh! It's a bit spicy in the beginning... ...but in the end it is really tasty. It's really tasty, dude. It's spicy. Now will you tell me, where are we going? To a lovely place. Wow, what a view. Beautiful. Finally we are here. See. I love it. It's going to be sunset, I am going to record it in the DSLR. I will get my DSLR. Beautiful, Coffee. Where did it go? I must have kept it at the back, I will see. Kartik... I can't find my DSLR. Look properly, it must be inside only, in the bag or in the car. I looked everywhere, I can't find it, do you know... I had taken photos and videos of the whole trip. I thought I will upload them when I get home, and show it to everyone. But now what? All my photos are gone. Now what will I share, and what will I show? Oh, what do you mean by that? It's just a DSLR... ...you see this view... ...or you will miss whatever you have right now. And Disha, this time... ...will slip from your hands like sand. You forget everything and live for the moment. You just want to give a philosophical lecture. For you the camera is not important but it is for me. I wanted to become a blogger, and this was my first step. Do you know, I had clicked photos and videos of the entire journey. I thought I will go home and first upload them, show them to everyone. And I had recorded that villages entire legendary story narrative. Everything has gone, what will I do? You are a 'fakir' all this doesn’t not make a... ...difference to you, but it makes a difference to me. I understand... ...but you see your dreams with your eyes shut... ...to fulfill your dreams, you have to open your eyes. Or whatever you have right now, will also go away. I don't want to listen to anything, you go and leave me alone. Come on Coffee, we will put up the tent and prepare for dinner. [WATER SLOSHING] Kartik. Hmm. I am not in the mood... ...but I can help you. You will help me, to cook? Yes, usually I am a girl who orders online... ...but, I will help you a bit. Yes. Really, then do one thing, cut this vegetable... I will go and get dry wood. - Okay, fine. - Sit. Hmm. [GRUNTS] Disha. Yes. You cut this... ...but who will peel this vegetable? You asked me to cut it... ...not to peel. You have to peel the potatoes and onion before cutting it. You peel them. Really? Huh! [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Hmm. Wow Kartik. Amazing, delicious. Thank you. You have made it very well. You know how to cook well. And you know how to eat well. Very funny, I also helped a bit today. Hmm. But where did you learn to cook so well? By experiments. Yes. Actually, I like to eat different dishes... ...and because of that I became fond of cooking. So sometimes when I have a chance like this, I make it. Kartik. Hmm. Should I ask you something? Yes, ask. You must be having a girlfriend, right? What, girlfriend? You think a 'fakir' like me will have a girlfriend? I am a wanderer, sometimes here and sometimes there. That's it, keep moving forward. Kartik, you roam around with Coffee so much... ...don't you find it difficult? Not at all. Coffee is very clever... ...and I care about him more than myself. Coffee is my life. My mom was also like that for me. Father would be busy in work... ...could not give time, but... ...my mom was my life. When I was 9 years old... ...she left me and went away. Kartik. Hmm. Everyone says, that... ...after people die they become stars. Is it true? - [SIGHS] - I don't know. But it's a good hope. Sometimes a man spends his whole life on hope. You see these stars... ...in such darkness they are a hope of light. That's right. Because of the stars the night looks so beautiful. It's such a peaceful feeling. I remember a beautiful song... - ...let's play it. - Right now? Yes. Come on, you also dance. "Don't sulk like that." "Lover." "Smile, I will relax." Kartik. Huh? Come on let's go to sleep, it's very late. Yes, let's sleep. Do one thing, you sleep in the tent... ...and I will sleep in the car. You sleep in the tent. Why do you want to sleep in the car? In the tent? With you? Never. Have you heard your snores? They are so loud and terrible. Even your husband will not be able to sleep next to you. Kartik, wait! Where is Disha? Disha! Hmm. But you see your dreams with your eyes closed... ...to fulfill your dreams, you have to open your eyes... ...or, what you have with you right now, will also go away. Hey, madam... ...good morning. Hey Kartik, you 're here? See, I made this sand house. What has happened to you today? You woke up so early, and made a house on the on the seashore. - You are Disha only, right? - Yes. Wait a minute... I think maybe last night you... ...must have got possessed. Shut up, Kartik. Nothing has happened. What you told me yesterday... I understood today. Oh no... I know from the first day that you are a slow thinker. Kartik! [LAUGHS] Okay, I will show you a magic today. Magic? Yes. Magic. Close your eyes... ...and listen to the noise of the sea. Feel it in your mind... ...and see, with the waves of the sea... ...the restlessness of your mind is also flowing... ...and see this vast sea... ...this vast sea, this wave and this view. Capture it in your eyes forever... ...and give your life a gift this time, this moment... ...no one take from you. Feel this wind, feel this heat... ...feel every breeze. Feel every breathe. [WATER SLOSHING] Kartik, I had never thought... ...that you will meet me on this trip... ...and I will come out of my mobile world, and enjoy nature. "You tell what should I say." "You know it." "What is hidden in my heart." "You can read." "You tell what should I say." "You know it." "What is hidden in my heart." "You can read." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." "Since I have met you." "You have shown me the world." "By your talks." "You make me loose my senses." "Since I have met you." "You have shown me the world." "By your talks." "You make me loose my senses" "I speak about you" "I stay in your heart." "This moment remains in my eyes" "I will become your memory" "I will tell the nights." "You reside in my breathe." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." "I look for you." "In my memories." "You take me, with you." "I look for you." "In my memories." "You take me, with you" "I will walk with you" "I will tell the climate." "See how this breeze is flowing" "I will walk with you" "I will tell the climate." "To sing new songs." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." "Only you, just you" "I don't know just one me." Kartik. Yes? You should open a hair salon for pets. Why? You have given Coffee such a lovely haircut. [LAUGHS] Okay, after how long are you going to your father's village? It's been a long time. But how do you know? I can come to know... I saw at Vijubhai's place... ...that you find it very difficult to adjust in a village's nature. Yes. You notice me well. Oh no, just like that. [LAUGHS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Is this aunty? Oh. Disha. Oh, Disha. I am seeing you after so many years. How are you, dear? I thought you must not be comfortable in the... ...village and that is why you don't come here. - No. - Who is this? Did you get married? Huh? No, aunty. He is my friend, I met him on the way, Kartik. Alone on a trip with a boy? It is a very long story aunty, should I come in and tell you? Oh, yes. Yes dear welcome, you also come. You'll must be tired, relax and sit. Did you recognise her? This is our Sakshi. My daughter, Sakshi. Oh yes, how are you Sakshi? Absolutely fine. She is of marriageable age now. You would have got me married... ...but I had a lot of support from elder father. Or else my parents were after my marriage. So what are you doing right now? I am an intern the government hospital right now. Oh, wow. I don't see you on social media at all... ...and you are not on my friend list also. Because I use social media only when I have work. Mostly I put updates about our school. Updates about our school? I did not know we had a school. Kartik, why are you holding this toy and sitting, put it down. [LAUGHS] Aunty, this is not a toy... ...this is my cute Coffee. Oh wow, it's so cute. I thought it was a toy. Which guest has come? Oh Disha, you. You've come, dear? Yes, uncle. Elder brother just called. He was asking... ...whether Disha has come or not? Your phone was switched off. Uncle, I don't have charge in my phone. And, what are you'll doing... ...let Disha rest a bit she must be tired, you'll just started talking. Who is this man? He is Disha's friend. Disha has forgotten her way... ...and above that she had also lost her purse also... ...so he helped her. Thank you very much, dear. You must also be tired... ...freshen up a bit... ...and then go and roam in the village. Okay? Look there. See Disha, this is our school, elder father is a trustee here. First every child had to go and study in another school... ...but now every child studies here. Disha, your father has done a lot for the villagers... I am truly inspired. Hello sir. This is my elder father's daughter Disha, and her friend Kartik. - Hello sir. - Hello. How are you dear? Your father has brightened the future of this village. Kartik, what are you seeing? Disha, I also want to play with these children. What? - Yes. - Have you gone mad? You have become so big, will you play with small kids? So what, dude? It will be fun, sir can we play with them? Yes sure, even they will enjoy. - Come. - Come on. Children, you'll have to do a competition with these three people... ...and you'll have to win. [CHEERING] - Yea! - Cheater, cheater! Cheater! [SCREAMING] [LAUGHS] Even I enjoyed. Did you enjoy? Yes sir, we really enjoyed becoming kids with kids... ...we really enjoyed playing. And we really enjoyed looking at your excitement. Thank you so much, sir. Shall we go? Okay sir, thank you. - Okay bye. - Bye. [LAUGHS] Yes, we really enjoyed. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Take this dear. What is this, uncle? You see it yourself. Is this me? Wow. You look so beautiful. You were very stubborn in your childhood. I used to make you sit on my shoulder and take you around the village everyday. And then you used to insist and make me buy these toys. Thank you, uncle. Here. Good boy. Coffee, take. - You want to eat stick? - I am asking one minute, have patience. [LAUGHS] Oh, but... I will be back in a minute. Yes, I know it. Okay, then should I go and give it? Yes. You don't talk, I am doing it. Take, uncle. Disha, sit dear. See Disha... Kartik is a very nice boy. Yes. And I think he is suitable for you also... ...and if you say. I will speak to elder brother. Oh no, uncle. We are just friends nothing of that sort. So, please. Oh... ...don't you like him? Then we can speak about Sakshi? Huh? What? What aunty, you also? You don't think of anything else except marriage. [SIGHS] - Look at her Sakshi. - Why are you talking nonsense? [MUMBLING] Give me that. Okay dear, take care. - When will you come back again? - Now I will keep come during my vacations. And you also come. Definitely dear, go carefully. Call me when you reach home. - Should we go now? - Okay, Uncle. - Come on, bye Sakshi nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Bye. Bye. [ENGINE REVVING] - Why have you stopped here? - Because my destination has come. From here my journey is separate and your journey is separate. Did not think about it. Okay, one second... ...your DSLR. Don't worry, your photos and videos are both safe in this. And yes, I really enjoyed on this trip with you. I will always remember this trip. Even I also really enjoyed. And, I want to tell you something. Even I want to say something to you. Okay, you say it. So, I have given you lectures on the whole trip. Hmm. But like you even I have a few dreams, Disha. What? Time does not wait for anyone... ...and I also want to walk with this time. I want to enjoy all the emotions of nature. Can you see those two roads ahead? They meet at one place and separate... ...because both their destinations are different, the direction is different. Do you understand what I am saying? Yes Kartik, I understand. All the best, and take care of Coffee. Will you remember me? Always. Should we go? Hmm, okay. [VEHICLE PASSING BY] One minute. This is a gift for you. What is this? Solution to all your problems... ...and all the answers to your questions are in this. Not now, open it after I am gone. Okay. Disha, you wanted to tell me something, right? Nothing, Kartik. Thank you. Thank you? Hmm. Okay, should I go? - Hmm. - Okay. Bye bye, Coffee. Bye Kartik. Bye Disha, take care. Come on, dear. [SIGHS] Bye, bye. Come on, Coffee. Bye. Bye. [TEMPLE BELL] "This road feels new." "The destination is with me." "This smiling face." "Seems like a childhood dream." "This road feels new." "The destination is with me." "This smiling face." "Seems like a childhood dream." "Eyes stare at the sky." "My feet have wings." "Eyes stare at the sky." "My feet have wings." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." "Heart beats of this heart." "Feel like a song of the mind." "Even without words" "I Like this song" "I feel morning is smiling with the rays of the sun." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." "My mind feels like it is flying." Hello, father. Disha, dear. Say, what happened? Why are you crying, dear? I want to express my feeling, father. Which I have not done till today. Thank you so much, for everything. You never let me miss mother till today. I have hurt you so much. And you, have always fulfilled all my wishes with a smile. If anyone tells me... ...have you seen God... I will say yes. For me, my father is God. Thank you so much, father. Love you. Dear, love you too. I have got my lost Dishu back. Come fast to your father. Yes father, I am coming. Bye. Oh dear... ...come fast to your father, dear. [CRYING] "The life is colourful with the early morning." "Like I also started flowing with the river." "The fragrance from a garden of flowers was such." "It came and said in my ears quietly." Father. Thank you.
