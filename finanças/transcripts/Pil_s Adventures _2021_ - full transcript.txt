[viva kids audio logo] [music playing] [birds chirping] [crickets chirping] [chatter] [music playing] Hmm? Hey, I've never seen you before. Are you from here? Are you alone? Come here, with us. [music playing] You must be hungry. Here. [music playing] My name's Pil. The Scratcher and Fluffy. If you want, you can be part of our gang. But first of all, what are we going to call you? [music playing] Wait, I know. Gobbly. Come on, I'll explain how things work around here. This is our city, called Foggyborough. [music playing] The motto of the city is, to build the kingdom, one must find where nobility resides. You get it? Yeah, me neither. The old king came up with it-- Theobald. See that guy there? That's Tristain. He's the one who governs right now, but he's not the king. He's just the regent. That's the guy who's going to be our next king-- Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. Prince Roland. [chatter] To be honest, Gobbly, we don't really care who governs around here. We're orphans. We live on the street, and the nobles sure aren't going to take care of us. [music playing] So we've got to fend for ourselves. OK, hold on tight, Gobbly. Woo-hoooooo! [music playing] Woo-hoo! Yeah! You OK, Gobbly? When we want something to eat, we go see Crobar. This time, that pesky sprite won't escape me. [music playing] And Crobar thinks I'm some kind of sprite. He thinks I've got magic powers. Now watch this. That sprite won't be able to resist this mince tart. Oh, cockerel. [music playing] You see that? I'm not dreaming. I know it's that pesky sprite. Now, where's he hiding? A-ha! There you are, cockerel. [music playing] I didn't see that one. Now, just you wait. [music playing] Pesky little sprite. [music playing] I'll catch you, cockerel. Make way. Make way for Lord Tristain. [music playing] What on earth are you doing, Crobar? It's that sprite, Lord Tristain. I'm trying to catch that pesky little sprite. A sprite? Yes, Lord Tristain, a sprite that loves to eat mince tarts. And if I manage to catch him, then maybe I can become a knight, and that would be a great-- achievement? Crobar, the only thing you're achieving is proving you're a good-for-nothing. Crobar, a knight. What a laugh. Poor Crobar. He's not even close to becoming a knight. Anyway, thanks to him we have mince tarts every day. Come on, pass me the ball. Come on. Here, catch. Hey. Hey, over here. Throw it. Go on. Pass it. OK, throw it to me. Here. No, you kicked it too hard. I kicked it too hard? I can do what I want. [music playing] Come inside right now, children. That's the sprite. Don't go near him. [music playing] But-- [music playing] [doors slamming] [music playing] [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [music playing] Yay! Yay! Yay! [music playing] Prince Roland, I've ruled over this kingdom since your father died, and I've done very well. Since I've been regent, I've had the commoners at my feet. They give me all their wealth, without complaint, because they fear me. I levy more and more taxes, and they don't oppose me. And you-- you think that because it's your birthday I'll just hand you the throne. Never. Do you know what I'm going to give you for your birthday? This! Ha! Ha ha! Happy birthday. Here, take that. Who's the smart one now? Here, take that. Uh, Lord Tristain? I was passing by and heard noise. You OK? Yes, yes. I just had a little craving for chicken. Huh? OK. Well, good night, Lord Tristain. Good night, Prince Roland. [music playing] It'll be your last. [trumpets playing] Hear-- Hear ye, hear ye. Oh, come on. Enough with the tooting already. Good. Hear ye, hear ye, you citizens of Foggyborough. Today is the 20th birthday of our dear Prince Roland. He's henceforth of age to take the throne. Rejoice, and bring food for the great coronation banquet for all the nobles of the realm. Come forward. Come no, come on. Provisions for the banquet go over there. Cold meats go in the back, and vegetables on the side. Ah, cheese. Put that in the shade, please. Hello, good sir. And what did you bring? Lovely mince tarts for the banquet. Mmm. Can I see? No, no, they're for the Prince. All right, over there. [bell tolling] [chatter] Go on. Eat as much as you want. But keep it down, OK? Gentlemen, damsels, make way for the minstrels and troubadours, who will feel this castle with music and fun on this wondrous occasion. Joy and gaiety will feel the air. Forget about your worries, and enjoy a happy troupe. [music playing] Wow. [music playing] Come on, Jiggler. Hurry up. Yes, yes, I'm coming. I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming, coming. Whaaaa-- Jiggler. Look, Jiggler, you've got to put a bit of effort, OK? It's the Prince's coronation, so we need you to give it all you've got. And try to be funny for once. Ah, in that case, I think this is a job for Mr. Destardo. Hello. No, no, no, not that puppet. Oh, come on. Please, Lugan, just one or two jokes. I'm sure they're going to love Mr. Destardo. No, they will not love Mr. Destardo. Every time you take out that puppet, you make fun of the nobles. No, no, this time it has nothing to do with them. It's just a little riddle. What's the difference between a rainbow and a noble at work? You might at least see a rainbow sometimes. He's funny, huh? Jiggler, if you disrespect Lord Tristain, he'll lock us up under the tower. understand? Yes, Lugan. Come on, let's go. And put away that puppet. You heard him, Mr. Destardo. I'm so sorry, but you can't go on tonight. Lugan, you're censoring me. I'm not afraid to tell the truth to the nobles. You-- you just bow to them. You're a coward, Lugan. A coward and a jerk. Jerk, Lugan. Jerk, Lugan. You're a jerk. (SINGING) J-- J-- J-- jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way. Jingle bells, jingle [gibberish].. No more puppets. [music playing] Hello. Hello. Do you know how happy I am to hear you laugh? You're the first person to think I'm funny. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your horses there, freckles. You're not the one she finds funny. I am. You fool, you. I love what you do with that little sock puppet. Excuse me? What did you call me? You're the old sock. This is Mr. Destardo. My name's Jiggler. My name's Pil. Make way. Make way for Duchess Alienor. [trumpets playing] Aunt Alienor, hello. Oh, Roland, my puddins. Who is this Duchess Alienor? She's Prince Roland's aunt. Oh, you're going to be king. My brother Theobald would be so proud of you. What a great day for the kingdom. Come closer, dear. Come. There's something you must know. A short time before he died, your father hid a treasure, a treasure he bequeathed to you. A treasure? A treasure? He said, in order to find it, you absolutely have to go-- Did you hear that, Jiggler? There's a treasure hidden in Foggyborough. Oh, it would be great if I could find it. --nobility resides. Do you understand? No. Yeah, me neither. But do think about it. And whatever you do, don't tell Tristain. If he knew, he might-- Ah, Prince Roland and Duchess Alienor. Oh, Tristain, guess you're unemployed now. Yes, yes. What's with all the trunks? Are you moving? Oh, I just brought a selection of clothes for the ceremony. I want to look presentable for my nephew's coronation. Anyways, I'll leave you be. I'll go pick out my outfit. See you. Your aunt is charming as ever. Prince, if you would come with me. I'd like to speak with you before the coronation. I hope that sprite doesn't come and bother us today. Say, aren't those the mince tarts the old man brought? I better check to see if they're not too salty because sometimes they put too much salt. [biting sound] Mince tarts that bite and move by themselves? Cockerel! [music playing] Alert! Alert! There's an intruder in the courtyard! An intruder! Pesky sprite. [music playing] We have to go up to the dungeon? Yes, what I have to say is very confidential. Are dungeons usually this high up? [music playing] No, Gobbly, that's poison. [music playing] Hey, isn't that Lord Tristain, with a sorceress? Huh? [music playing] Oh, no. Gobbly, don't touch anything. You want us to get caught or what? Huh? [music playing] What are these weird potions? [music playing] I think you did something here. [music playing] Going up stairs and having armor is tiring. Yes, well, whose idea was it to walk around in armor all day long? OK, Tristain, what do you want to talk about? The throne. I've been governing for 15 years, waiting for you to come of age and succeed your father. That day has come. If you don't feel ready, if you'd rather take more time, if you'd rather wait another year or two, I would understand. I'd understand completely. No, Gobbly. So what do you think? Would you like that? I stay a bit longer on the throne? Oh, no, no, don't worry about that. It's time for me to face my responsibilities. I'll manage. Yeah, I'll be fine. I know it doesn't always seem like it, but I'm not as big an idiot as I look. That's enough. Quite enough. If you really want to take the throne, there's only one thing to do. We'll have a little toast to celebrate, OK? A small toast. Shh, doggy, don't make a sound. I'll give you a taste of one of my special drinks, and you can tell me what you think. A toast to my coron-- your coronation. To Foggyborough. Yes, there we go. Ah, my dear Roland, I've got a story to tell you. I think it'll interest you. It's the story of a young boy, a young boy who looked up to his king. Long live the King. Long live King Theobald. Long live the King. He dreamt of being cheered by the crowd, just like him, to wear the crowd, to sit on the throne. [music playing] But his destiny was to learn magic, like his godmother. [music playing] The young boy didn't want this as his destiny, so he altered it. [music playing] He developed a potent poison to get rid of the King. But there had to be a culprit, so he accused his godmother. It was her. She fled and took refuge in the scariest place in the kingdom, the Cursed Forest. Today, the only thing standing between the boy and being crowned king is the Prince. [music playing] Hey, hey. Oh dear Roland, did it go down the wrong way? Trouble digesting the poison perhaps? Oh, what a pity. The Prince struck down by a mysterious illness on the day of his coronation. And I will remain in power. Wh-- Nugget? Where are you, Nugget? [music playing] Oh, well, I'd better get going now. You're not going anywhere. I'm afraid you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sorry, but I can't leave any witnesses. [music playing] Is he not dead yet? [music playing] Did I mix up the ingredients? It doesn't matter. First, the urgent and then the Prince. Pesky sprite, I know I saw you come up here. [music playing] I got to get in shape. What? [music playing] Prince Roland? [music playing] Prince? [music playing] Oh, cockerel. You OK, Prince? [music playing] Oh, the sprite. Crobar? Yes, it's the sprite, and he's bewitched the Prince. Catch him, Crobar. Catch him. Come back here. [music playing] Come here, you pesky little sprite. I'll teach you to turn our prince into a chicken. More stairs. [music playing] No, wait, come back, Prince. It was a joke. [music playing] That didn't go as well as I'd hoped it would. [music playing] Ow, ow, ow. Got a stitch in my side. [music playing] Excuse me. Working. Coming through. Coming through. Like a stampede of Clydesdales. Looks like you've got a big problem, Prince Roland. And I think I'm the only person who can help you. Luckily, I'm willing to help you out. But in exchange I want the treasure your father left. It's up to you. Good luck. Tore through here and sent everything flying. It's quite insane. What is it? [chicken clucking] [cat meowing] Oh, get away, you beastly thing. So thought about my proposition? Tristain, thank goodness. The guard just tore through here, sending my outfits flying. You do realize what a scandal this could cause? You have to do something, Tristain. That guard, the one who manhandled my outfit. It's a deal. And then there was this beast that was very ugly, hideous. A beast you say? Where did it go? It went that way. When Theobald was king-- Yes, yes. --this would never have happened. [music playing] Tell me, milady, have you seen a sprite go by? A sprite? No. And a chi-cat? A what? Yeah, you know. It's half cat, half chicken. So a chi-cat. Oh. Yes. And I probably shouldn't tell you this, but the chi-cat is Prince Roland. Oh, no, poor Prince Roland. And your furry friends, have they seen the chi-cat? No, no, no. My friends haven't seen it, Crobar. Wait, how do you know my name? Well, it's-- it's-- it's because everyone knows Crobar. Everyone knows that you're the bravest guard in Foggyborough. No! Yes. Among the nobles, everyone says that you'll soon become a knight. Oh, the Prince! My treasure. Let the banquet begin. [music playing] How am I going to find him in all of this? I'll help you, Crobar. Really? You would do that? Of course. I am a princess. It's my job to help princes. Cockerel, is that true? You're a princess? Yes, yes, I sure am a princess. OK, look. You go that way, and I'll go this way. [music playing] And now, ladies and gentlemen, please give a round of applause for the irresistible, the hilarious Jiggler. [applause] Please try to be funny. Hey. Hello. Do you want to laugh? I've got what you need. I have one joke with two punch lines. Punches get it? Whoa, this is one tough crowd. More funny. More. So what is square and yellow? The sun. Yeah, I lied. The sun isn't square. Remind me again why I keep this kid in the troupe. Because he's your nephew, Lugan. Oh, yeah, that's it. Anyway, at least he's not using the puppet. Who would like to pull my finger? You, madam? [music playing] Give me that. Hey, hey, hey hey. Let go of that, madam. That's not him either. What is brown, soft, and smells like poo? [music playing] It's poo. [music playing] [chatter] Any luck, Crobar? I haven't found him. [music playing] He can't be far. Keep looking. [music playing] How about this one? What do you call a knight who's sure of himself? Sir-tainly. Get it? Certainly? Sir-tainly. So bad. [chatter] Jiggler. Oh, hey there, Pil. Can you help me? Can you take out Mr. Destardo to liven up the atmosphere? OK, friends, it's time for me to introduce my partner, Mr. Destardo. Oh, no, please not the puppet. Hello! Play some music loud, very loud. Did you hear about the nobel who paid his taxes? No? Yeah, me neither. [music playing] Don't like that? No? OK, moving on. How about a riddle then? Faster. How do you recognize a thief who steals from the kingdom? He wears a crown on his head. [music playing] Louder. Faster, louder. [music playing] Let me through. Out of my way. Let me through. What's the difference between a cushion and Lord Tristain? At least the cushion belongs on the throne. [chatter] Prince Roland. The chi-cat. My treasure. [music playing] Move aside. I need to get by. [chatter] Here kitty chi-cat. [music playing] Move aside. [music playing] Don't be scared. Come here, little prince. Don't be scared. [music playing] Did you like that? [music playing] They're very good, Nugget. A little too good. We're going to need some help to eliminate the Prince. [music playing] It's quiet, huh? What did you say? She said, it's quiet. [music playing] Ha! We sure spoiled the nobles' dinner, didn't we? Come on, Prince. Let me take you back to the castle, and we'll go see Tristain. He'll know how to help you. Hey, what's gotten into him? I'll take care of him, Crobar. I'm a princess. I'm supposed to take care of princes. You can go back to chasing your sprite now. OK, goodbye. Oh, well. All right. You see? I kept my word. I got you out of the castle. Now we have to make you human again. We'll go see that sorceress in the Cursed Forest. She must really hate Tristain. She'll help you. After that, I'll get my treasure. Princess, where are you going? You're not going to leave without us? Yes. But after everything that's happened, Mr. Destardo and I are, well, unemployed and looking for work right now. Could you maybe hire us? No. Are you sure, Princess? If you don't hire us, Princess, I might have to have a word or two with our friend Crobar about that pesky little Foggyborough sprite he's looking for. Oh, come on, Jiggler. You wouldn't turn me in, would you? I wouldn't, but he would. Would you stop it. He's your puppet. Oh, no, he's my human. It's not the same. Fine. You can come with me. Where are we going? To find the sorceress in the Cursed Forest. Woo-hoo! We're going to the Cursed Forest. Where is that anyway? Well, I don't really know. It's due west, about a day's journey. But you really shouldn't go there. Why not? Because the Cursed Forest is a forest that's been cursed. [music playing] Yeah, we figured something like that. You know the way? Yes, I used to gather mushrooms there when I was young. Back then, it wasn't that cursed. But now it's much more cursed. Come on, Crobar. Are you really afraid of a forest? Not just any forest, Princess. A cursed one. You want to become a knight, right, Crobar? Yes. What if I helped you with that? Seriously? For sure. I'm a princess. It's my job. I can make anyone a knight. I just need to do that thing with the sword on the shoulders. What's it called again? It's called dubbing. Oh, right, that's it. Take us to the Cursed Forest, Crobar. Help us turn the Prince back into a human. And, boom, I'll dub you a knight. That would be an honor, Princess. That's great. Put it there. [music playing] Onward to the Cursed Forest. My humor is at your service, Princess. And my weapon will protect you, Princess. [music playing] Cockerel. [bell tolling] [chatter] Just think, that's actually Prince Roland. Yeah, well, that's what you get when nobles intermarry. Now, Jiggler, a little respect. Please remember the princess is a noble as well. It wasn't me. It's him. [music playing] Make way. Make way for Princess Pil. Step aside, good people. Make way. Crobar, do you have to do that? Yes, Princess. I have to make sure that you are given the respect you are due. The respect that I'm due? Princess. Your respect, Your Highness. Greetings, Princess. Hello. Yoo-hoo. Wow. Wow, the Princess is beautiful. Your Highness. It's not that bad being a princess. Looks like somebody's getting a big head. Jiggler, your sock needs to show some respect. Hey, did she call me a sock again? Enough, Mr. Destardo. Now bow to the princess. No, I don't bow down to anybody. That's enough. Back in the pocket. No, not the pocket. Please not the pocket. It's dark in here. Let me out! [birds chirping] [music playing] (SINGING) Dash those worries. Sing out loud. The cat is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Together we're strong, and nothing will stop us. Cockerel, beware. Your Highness. Princess. Prince-- [music playing] Huh? [music playing] (SINGING) Dash those worries. Sing out loud. The cat is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Together we're strong, and nothing can stop us. Cockerel, beware. [vocalizing] [music playing] (SINGING) Sing it. Sing it. Sing a melody. The catch is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Raise your head, and keep moving forward. Nothing can stop us now. [music playing] Prince Roland! Crobar, I'm hungry. Yes, Princess, I'll be right there. [flute playing] Oh, it's too hot, Crobar. Oh, yes, sorry. Now it's too cold. A thousand pardons, Princess. I'll get you another bowl. Fetch them for my weasels as well, Crobar. Yes, yes. There you are. Enjoy your meal, Princess. Poor dear, sleeping outside when you're a princess. So sad. You have promised to make me a knight, Princess. That has been my dream. I wanted to thank you somehow, so I made this modest gift for you. [flute playing] Hey, watch it, Princess. You're becoming as snobby as a real noble. Crobar? That's very pretty. Thank you. Glad to be of service, Princess. [horses neighing] [chatter] [mumbling] Pardon? [mumbling] I don't understand what you're saying. What are you doing here? Ahh. I need to make some people disappear, and I'll pay you for it. Ah, yes. Eliminating people for a little money. We can do that for sure, but it's a shame. Really? Why's that? Because right now we've got a subscription plan! Subscription plan? Yes, we offer quality service, professionalism. We adapt to each client. Satisfaction guaranteed. For example, with our special ambassador plus, you can have unlimited assassinations on whoever you please, with a bonus of torture. We [inaudible] We plunder. We burn. And we hurt little kitty cats. Oh, no, we stopped doing that. Sorry. All right, then. I guess I'll take the ambassador plus. Yeah! Ambassador plus, ambassador plus. Congratulations. However, the ambassador plus subscription, as you can imagine, costs a little extra. Money is not a problem. Now, the four individuals that must disappear. Four? I'm afraid four is too many for the ambassador plus. You're going to need to sign up for the premium plan. Yeah, premium plan. Premium plan. Oh, all right. I'll take the pre-- are you trying to play me for a fool here? Yes, I guess I am. Well, at least I tried. So who are the four individuals you want to disappear? These guards-- will you let me finish my sentence? What I was going to say was, these guards will show you the way they're headed. But now they won't be able to do anything. Come on, follow me. I'm really tired of this lot. [birds chirping] [music playing] Be careful because from here on in it's cursed. And over there is really, really cursed. This isn't too bad, but it's cursed just the same. So be careful. Yoo-hoo. Sorceress, yoo-hoo. Where are you? For 15 years, she's been living here all alone? Maybe she's gone a little-- A little what? A little nutso. And this coming from a guy who talks to a sock. Look, we'll have a better chance of finding her if we split up. Everybody choose a path to take. Good luck. OK, splitting up in the Cursed Forest. Good idea. All right, be brave. You won't let some Cursed Forest scare us. No sir. [ominous music] It's just a forest that's a bit cursed. [ominous music] Madam sorceress, yoo-hoo. Hey, Jiggler. You want to quit jiggling so much? I think I might have heard something. [ominous music] [birds cawing] [whispering] Oh, cockerel. [whispering] Hmm? [whispering] Huh? [whispering] Crobar. Jiggler. Over here. Did you find something? [whispering] Yes, look over here. The sorceress left her footprints. But they stop right here, as if she flew away. [music playing] Did you hear that? Yes, that sounds close. At this very moment, she could be right behind us. Let's all turn around at the same time. Yeah, all right. We'll turn on 3. Ready? 1. 2. 2 and 1/2. 3. I guess she's not here. You don't belong in here. Get out right now. But we need your help to save the prince of Foggyborough. I don't care about Foggyborough, and I don't care about the Prince. Now get out of here. [music playing] Wait, what are you doing, Princess? [music playing] [birds cawing] [music playing] Huh? [music playing] It's the story of a young boy. He developed a potent poison to get rid of the King, so he accused his godmother. It was her! [music playing] You're a stubborn one. I know you weren't the one who poisoned Theobald. I know that you are a good person. You will help us save the Prince, right? I've changed. You don't know what it's like to be hunted, to live alone like an animal to avoid being captured. Yes, I know exactly what it's like. But if you help me save the Prince, that will all change for me. [music playing] It's fine. She's going to help us. Yeah? We must act fast, or the Prince will stay like this forever. [music playing] To prepare the antidote, I'll need one very special ingredient. And what would that be? The dung from a unicorn. Do unicorns really poo? Yes. And there's only one place on Earth you can find the dung of a unicorn, in the Glen of the Beast. A beast? Like a werewolf? No. This beast is much worse than a werewolf. You will take the mountain path until you reach the Glen. When you get there, don't linger. Pick up the poo, and get out of there. Whatever you do, stay out of the shade. Hold on. Is this going to be dangerous? You came into the Cursed Forest, looking for a sorceress to break the spell that turned the Prince into a chi-cat. Yes, it's going to be dangerous. What did you expect? Well, if it's dangerous, we'd better leave the Prince here, right? Yes, he'll be safe here with me. Oh, yeah? See that, Jiggler? Turns out the sorceress isn't nutso after all. Yum, yum. Yum, yum, yum. Come on, Nugget. Find them. [music playing] There you go. At least with this, you won't catch a cold. Thanks, Crobar. [birds chirping] That's funny. With that hood on, she reminds me of the Foggyborough sprite. Oh, yeah, you're right, Crobar. Go on, catch her. Catch her. No, no, no, no, it's a joke, Crobar. He's joking. Yeah, I know. I get it. [music playing] This is it. We're in the Beast's territory. [music playing] [growling] The Beast! It's got me! Run! Run! Hey, Shee Shee, that's enough. Stop bothering these people. Come here. Oh, don't be afraid. She's gentle, but sometimes she gets a little hungry. Oh, no, not my mince tart. That was my last one. Well, Shee Shee sure does love those mince tarts. So what brings you up around here? We're looking for a unicorn. You're too funny, you. There's no such thing as unicorns. Hey, look, Crobar. Over there. We found it. Only thing is it's in the shade. I'll go, Princess. You sure? Yes, it's my duty. Be careful, Crobar. [ominous music] Unicorn. I come here every day with my sheep. If there was a unicorn around, I'm sure we'd have seen it. Right, Shee Shee? [ominous music] It's clouding over, cockerel. [ominous music] We don't have seasons anymore, I'm telling you. [ominous music] What is it? What's wrong? What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that? [growling] [music playing] Pil, behind you! [music playing] Hey, there we go. Didn't turn out to be that hard after all. [music playing] Hurry! [music playing] Come on, run, Jiggler! Run for your life! You can do this. Yes, yes, that's it. You're really going fast now. Are you flying? Oh, never mind, Jiggler. [music playing] Jiggler! [music playing] Princess, go find shelter. I'll take care of the Beast. [music playing] I'll get you out of there, Jiggler. Thanks, Crobar. [music playing] Hey, you're hitting Jiggler, you big oaf. Cockerel. That's all right. [music playing] Oh cockerel, I dropped my poo. I think I did too. [music playing] Crobar, you have proven that you deserve to be a knight. [music playing] Keep the unicorn busy while we grab the bag. Yeah, but how? Here, catch. [music playing] At your service, Princess. [music playing] Come on, Shee Shee. Catch that mince tart. Get it. [music playing] Yes. It's OK, Crobar. We got the bag. [music playing] Come on, Crobar. [music playing] Hang on tight. [music playing] Come back. I told you there's nothing to be scared of. If there's a unicorn here, I would have seen it for sure. Oh, darn it. I split my pants again. [groaning] [music playing] I don't believe it. We did it. We're going to save the Prince and complete our quest. And I'm going to become a knight. Sir Crobar the Knight. Sir Crobar the Knight. Don't you think you should tell him the truth? Sir Crobar the Knight. Well, you coming? Sir Crobar the Knight. Yeah, we're coming, Crobar. [music playing] Yeah, that's dead. [music playing] Flower of hellboar, slime of a slug, venom from a viper, and dung from a unicorn. [music playing] Sir Crobar the Knight. Sir Crobar the Knight. [music playing] There we are. The antidote is ready. Drink this. [music playing] Hey. It worked. Yeah, but he's buck naked. He needs undies. Undies! Undies, undies, undies, undies, undies. Here. It's all I could find. Thanks. There we go. Looks good, huh? Mission accomplished. We saved the Prince. [thundering] [music playing] I swear to honor and serve you till I die and fight for the cause of justice. I am ready to become your loyal knight. [music playing] You can't become a knight, Crobar. Because I'm not a real princess. I stole this dress when you were chasing me through the castle. Huh? Wait, so you're the sprite? Is that it? Yeah, I am. You lied to me. You manipulated me. Why would you do all that? To get to the treasure that Theobald stashed away. And I thought you were so honorable. In fact, you only want the gold. That's the only thing you care about. It's time the nobles learn to share their wealth. I didn't do it for pleasure. I did it to survive. You think it's easy, being an orphan, living on the street. Doesn't matter. That's no excuse for being dishonest. I really trusted you. I thought you respected me. I'm an idiot. An idiot. An idiot. I'm an idiot. Crobar. No, wait. [music playing] Go talk to him, Pil. It's never too late to ask for forgiveness. [music playing] Crobar. [thundering] [music playing] Tristain, it's been a long time. My dear godmother, I wish you no harm. I just came to get the Prince. You're too late, Tristain. I will not let you hurt him. I don't think you fully understand the situation. [music playing] We're going to burn everything. Yes, burn everything. Aim. Fire. [music playing] And you, Crobar. I knew you were a good-for-nothing but not a traitor. No, Crobar! Pil! [music playing] Pil! [music playing] Tristain! [music playing] No, no. Leave me alone. Pil! Pil! [music playing] Lord Tristain has returned. [music playing] Oh, cockerel, I'm leaving. What's happened? [chatter] People of Foggyborough, I have some very sad news to announce. The horrible sorceress, who, as you all remember, poisoned our good King Theobald, is back and kidnapped our prince, with her foul accomplices. She dragged Prince Roland into the Cursed Forest and then threw him into an abyss. Oh, my poor darling. And now he's dead. Dead. Dead, dead, dead. [music playing] Duchess. These criminals shall be executed. After that, we'll proceed with my coronation. Oh, yes. Since the Prince can no longer take his place on the throne, I gladly volunteer to be your new king. It's what Roland would have wanted. [music playing] Crobar. Jiggler. [music playing] Roland? Pil, I don't want to impose, but could you please help me again. Hold on. [music playing] We've got to get to Foggyborough before Tristain hurts our friends. You kept your promise, Pil. You saved my life. You've earned my father's treasure. Look, I don't care about your father's treasure. Really? OK. Well, that works out well because truth is, I don't know where it is. But I thought your aunt told you? Not really. She just said, in order to find it, my father had left a riddle to solve. To build-- what was it? "To build a kingdom, one must find where nobility sits." Oh, you know it? It's the town's motto, Roland. Everyone knows it. I knew it sounded familiar. OK, hold on, Roland. This might get bumpy. Woo-hoo! Watch out. Out of the way. Excuse us. Look, the Prince in his undies. What did you say? She said, it's the Prince in his underwear. [music playing] Keep going, Pil. I'll meet you there. [bell tolling] [music playing] All right, let's get started. Stop! [music playing] That's Pil. She's alive. Woo-hoo! She's alive. Huh? I thought she was dead. [music playing] Jiggler! [music playing] Tristain is a liar. He's the one who tried to kill Prince Roland. What do you mean tried? I killed-- that's not what I meant. And he's also the one who poisoned King Theobald. That's horrible. What nonsense. Seriously, who's going to believe this urchin? They'll believe me. Oh, cockerel, it's Prince Roland in his undies. So he's not dead either? When I kill people and they don't stay dead, it gets on my nerves. Listen, there's been a terrible misunderstanding. Let me explain what really happened. Oh, look behind you. It's horrible. What? Where? What is it? What? You lied to be king here! Don't let him get away. Crobar, I'm really sorry I lied to you. It's all right, Princess. It's all right. You don't have to call me Princess anymore. Whatever you want, Princess. Hey, what about me? Group hug. [music playing] Catapults, ready. [music playing] [chatter] And fire! We can't stay here. We have to leave the city. And let Tristain win? No way on Earth. I'll teach him not to go after my friends. And I must prevent him from using his magic on Foggyborough. Mr. Destardo and I will sabotage the catapults. Excuse me? All right, I'll go get reinforcements. I'll open the portcullis, Prince, so you can get inside the castle. Perfect. Now let's do this. [music playing] This is a rotten plan. Let's go, let's go. All right, go guard the portcullis. George, you got the ramparts, and try not to fall off this time. [music playing] Tristain. Godmother. You must stop this madness. Why have you become so cruel? I am not cruel. I'm powerful, and I intend to stay that way. Drink this, Nugget. [music playing] [bell ringing] Hi there. Hi. [music playing] A fire! I'm on fire! Fire! [music playing] People of Foggyborough, forward! Attack! [music playing] Take that. That's it. Hit them hard. [music playing] Throw them back. Come on, do something. Move. Hey, George, that's a mace in your hand, not a mutton chop. And you, Alrick, are you afraid of scratching your shield or what? Don't make me come down there. What was that? What are you doing? Me? Nothing. I was-- well, I'd better be going. [music playing] Wait right there, you. [music playing] I've never seen this guy before in my life. We're goners. Run, Jiggler! Run! Run for your life! This is bad, Mr. Destardo. No, no, we'll be safe in here. Don't worry. Maybe not. [music playing] Nugget, get rid of her. [music playing] [coughing] [music playing] Hey, what say we just talk this over? Fire, fire, fire! Water! I need water! Jiggler, be honest with me. Do I have flaming undies on my head? Yes, Mr. Destardo. Get them off of me! [music playing] That's bad. [music playing] Hey, Jiggler, I can't blow. Hold the door, Mr. Destardo. I'll take care of it. [music playing] Oh, cockerel, that was not water. What do we do now? We yell. Oh, good idea. [music playing] Pil. You have to make him drink this. [music playing] No! [music playing] Pil needs you now. [music playing] Oh, no, Pil. [music playing] I need powder for the cannon. Let me in. Let me get out. Jiggler, where are you? I need powder for the cannon. I can't help you, Crobar. I'm stuck in here. Jiggler, if I hold the door, you can go help him. Go on. But, Mr. Destardo, then you'll-- yes, I won't get out of here. Mr. Destardo, what am I going to do without you? You've got what it takes to be a great jester, Jiggler. Me, I'm nothing but a sock. Maybe, but you're also my best friend. You've got other friends now, and they need you, Jiggler. I'll always be with you in your heart. Now tie me to this door, and finish this! [laughing] See, little girl, that's what you get for acting like a princess. No one can stop me. [music playing] Hurry up, Jiggler. [music playing] Goodbye, Mr. Destardo. [music playing] Things are getting hot in there, fool. [music playing] Oh, mommy. [music playing] I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. Thanks, Jiggler. No problem. [music playing] I've had enough of this. [music playing] Guys, get out of here now! [music playing] Prince Roland, raise the drawbridge. All right, Crobar. [music playing] Come on, we can make it. We can make it. We can make it. We can make it. We made it! Let her go, Nugget. [music playing] No! [music playing] Well done. Crobar, this potion will slay that dragon. I'll take care of it. Come here, you filthy beast. [music playing] Oh, no. [music playing] Poor Crobar, did you actually think that you could slay a dragon? You think you're knight worthy? Come on, open your eyes. You're a good-for-nothing. [music playing] I'm sorry, Princess. I can't protect you. He's right. I'm a good-for-nothing. [music playing] My loyal Crobar, you have served and protected me, with honor and courage. Would you do me the honor of being my knight? Yes, Princess. Do you swear you'll fight to uphold justice and fairness? I swear I will, Princess. Then I hereby dub you my knight. You are Sir Crobar of Foggyborough. I always knew you were noble, Princess. Noble in your heart. Of course. That's the answer to the riddle. Tristain, hold on. I have something that might interest you. "To build a kingdom, one must know where nobility resides." Nobility is in your heart. [music playing] What is that? A treasure? Yes, the Theobald treasure. You want it, don't you? Oh, yes. Then come and get it. [music playing] My treasure. [music playing] Gobbly, the chew toy. [music playing] Just paper? What kind of treasure is that? I'll get you for this, you little brat. [music playing] You don't stand a chance. Nugget, do you want a yummy chew toy? [music playing] Princess, meeting you is the greatest adventure of my life. Crobar! [music playing] Prince Roland, you saved me. Undies! Undies! Undies! I need some undies! Come on, Nugget. Nugget, quickly. Get out of here now. [music playing] And don't you ever set foot in Foggyborough again, you scoundrels. Yeah, don't come back! [music playing] Pil. Crobar. Where are you, Pil? [music playing] Pil. Pil. [music playing] Crobar? [music playing] Crobar. [music playing] Crobar. [music playing] Crobar. [music playing] Crobar, don't leave me. I need you here. Can you hear me? Wake up, Crobar. That's an order, you hear me? You're my loyal knight now, and you must obey me. Don't leave me, Crobar. At your service, Princess. Crobar. [music playing] Thank you. Thank you, my friends. Thanks for everything you did for me and Foggyborough. [music playing] Of course. This is it, the Theobald treasure. [music playing] [side conversation] [music playing] Hey. I don't know you. You're not from here. Are you all alone? If you want, you can join our little gang. [music playing] This is Foggyborough. [music playing] Would you like to meet my friends? Woo-hoo! [music playing] Hello, madam sorceress. So how are the magic classes going? Great. My new pupils are fast learners. Oh, wow. [music playing] Ah, Pil, have you seen how well the construction's going? Look at that, my father's treasure. Yeah, well, actually the treasure is mine, but I decided to share it with everybody. The first orphanage in Foggyborough, and over there a library open to every citizen to enjoy, and there a hospital to take care of sick people in town. That's right. The treasure was a plan, instructions for a new village King Theobald wanted to build for his people. Hey, ho. Time to eat, cockerel. Crobar. My little princess. Come on, mince tarts for everyone, cockerel. [music playing] Hey, hey, I've got a joke. What's the difference between King Roland and a brick wall? Hold on, let's play some music, huh? And loud. A brick wall isn't as thick. [laughter] He said, thick as a brick wall. I don't get it. [music playing] [vocalizing] (SINGING) Dash those worries. Sing out loud. The cat is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Together we're strong, and nothing can stop us. Cockerel, beware. [vocalizing] (SINGING) Dash those worries. Sing out loud. The cat is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Together we're strong, and nothing can stop us. Cockerel, beware. Sing it. Sing it. Sing a melody. The cat is a chicken. The chicken a cat. Raise your head, and keep moving forward. Nothing can stop us now. [vocalizing] Ladies. I liked him better in his undies. Me too. [music playing] Oh, the brick wall. It isn't as thick. I get it. [laughing]
