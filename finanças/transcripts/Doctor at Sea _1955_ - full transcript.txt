(Simon) A Rolls-Royce is the ambition of most newly qualified doctors, and, preferably, a Harley Street address. l was practising medicine in more humble circumstances, and neither my new diploma nor my old car had got me very far. - Thank you. - Thats all right. Always a pleasure to help a colleague. l was a junior assistant in general practice - the medical equivalent of a plumbers mate. My partner thought l needed more experience. So did my patients. He divided the work. l did the surgery, night calls and rounds and he looked after the social side. - Ah, Simon. Late, arent we? - The Williams boys got tonsillitis. ltll clear up. Youll take surgery, wont you? l have a consultation. They need me urgently. - All right. - Thank you. (Simon) The doctor had a daughter. A healthy girl - Wendy. - Do you mind? - (Simon) o. Delicious, as always, dear. lts time you got married, my boy. Patients prefer married doctors. - They feel safer. - Yes. Theres plenty of time for that. Do you mind if l go? The picture starts at 8:10. Are you going to the pictures? Wendys going, too, arent you? - Why not go together? - ld love to. A pleasure. How lovely. ow, be good. The patients might feel safer, but l didnt - not with Wendy. Oh, Simon. lts you. l heard a noise. l thought it might be burglars. Are you working? Yes. Your father left a lot of forms to do. aughty Daddy. ever mind. lll help you. lts quite all right, Wendy. l can manage. Oh! Have you got a headache? - Yes, l have, rather. - l...lll rub your neck. - ld much prefer you didnt. - Oh, but lm good at this. - Where do you feel tense? - All over. l wish you wouldnt. Oh, Simon. l knew it was only shyness. - A-ha. - A-ha! An immediate operation was necessary. Like many better men before me, l ran away to sea. l got a job as a ships doctor on the SS Lotus of the Fathom Line, but first of all, l had to find her. Officer, can you tell me where the Lotus is berthed? - umber 15, the Lotus. - umber 15? - ew to these docks? - ew to any docks. Oh, well, go straight on till you come to that light. Turn left and carry on till you come to two lorries by the watchmans hut. Turn right, up the steps, down the narrow path, past the first two ships and its the third - about two miles as the crow flies. They say that worse things happen at sea but what could be worse than being landed with Wendy? The Lotus had one great advantage - she carried no passengers and that meant no women. - The doctor. - Come on in, Doc. - lm Hornbeam, Mate of this tub. - How do you do? Found us all right? Mr Archer, Second Officer. Mr Whimble, Chief Steward. Hes in charge of the booze. - Trail, our 3-0. - Hello, Doc. What sent you to sea? - Wine, women or crime? - Women, mostly. - Married? - o. Keep it that way. Wives and waves dont mix, old boy. Oh, behind the chimney stack is Fellowes, our apprentice. - Seventeen on Sunday. - ice to meet you. ice to have a young doc aboard. They told you about the last one, Flowerday, l suppose? - o, they didnt. - o? Oh. Oh, well, never mind. Are you just out of medical school? o, lve been in practice for two years. Hope youre hot on sailors troubles. o different to anyone elses, are they? - Ahem. Would you like a cigarette? - Thank you very much. l wonder if you know Sir Wallaby Glebe, the ophthalmic surgeon? Er, no, lm afraid l dont. Oh. l do, very well. Hes married to my cousin. - Oh, really? - Whatll you drink, Doc? - Hadnt l better see the Captain? - ot tonight. Hes not the social type. Perhaps because he isnt married, either. - either was his father! - (Laughter) (Ships horn sounds) Good morning, Doctor. Easter. lm the Doctors Steward. Oh, good morning. How do you do? How do you do, Doctor? lve a message from Father. - Father? - Yes, the Captain. He wants a bottle of his usual stomach mixture, pronto. He suffers from dyspepsia, does he? Oh, something chronic. When he has a spasm, lifes not worth living. - Thank you very much. - There we are, sir. The only stuff that squares up his innards is the special mixture he got from the late Dr Flowerday. Makes him bring up the wind, Doctor. Dr Flowerday was my predecessor? Oh, yes, sir. Yes. Very satisfied he was with me, if l might make so bold. Easter, what happened to Dr Flowerday? lf you dont mind, sir, ld rather not talk about it. - Shocking. - (Loud honking and creaking) lts them pipes, sir. You are situated below the Captains... (Gushing and gurgling) The late Dr Flowerday and l kept all our stores in there. Oh! (Laughs) - Do you play, Doctor? - l could learn, l suppose. Oh, the late Dr Flowerday was very keen on tennis racketing, - very keen indeed. - We seem to be very short of drugs. Shouldnt there be an official stock or something? The late Dr Flowerday and l had, er... an arrangement over the disposal of surplus stores. You flogged them, you mean? - Spoon. - Spoon. - Take a card, Doctor. - Wait a minute. Come on! ow look at it. Er...the, er...five of diamonds. Yes. Card tricks are rather out of place in a ships hospital. Kept Dr Flowerday in fits. Got narked when he couldnt work them out. Well, how are they done? Well, they was all five of diamonds, actually. Oh. You certainly know your way around a pack of cards, Easter. Oh, l should say so. Worked the halls for three years. Pin Yung, l was. (Adopts accent) Famous Chinese magician! Here, would you like to see my cuttings? o, thank you. l cant use this. Chuck it away.

Both in the same line of business, really, arent we, Doc? Morning. ice-looking bird. ls he yours? - Yes. - lm the new doctor. Yes, we know. Another flipping kid trying to be a sailor. (Knock at door) Come. Good morning, sir. Doctor. Well? Your stomach medicine, sir. - Whats on your head? - On my head? othing, sir. Exactly. Why not? Youve got a cap, havent you? Yes - company regulation pattern. - Then why arent you wearing it? - l dont know, sir. The cap is worn for visits to the Captain. Theres no tramp stuff here. This is my ship, Doctor, and shes properly run. l wonder if l could persuade you not to shake that too much. Stop telling me what to do. Change that corn plaster. lts not my job to change corn plasters! - Youre a doctor, arent you? - (Sighs) Yes. There they are, the new ones. - Women, l suppose? - l beg your pardon? - Drove you to sea. - Oh. Yes...in a way. l thought so. l can smell your type a mile away. l wont tolerate that with my officers. l dont approve of women. Theyre unnecessary. But surely even a seaman has to get launched somehow? l hope you understand your duties. Sick parades at nine oclock. Bring me the sick list at 10:30. l want to know whats wrong. one of this medical secrecy. Everything must be out in the open. Excuse me, sir. Get away from me. Leave me alone. - Excuse me.

The Admiralty has just issued the following gale warning. South to south-easterly gales now in operation in sea areas Portland, Wight, Dover, Thames, Heligoland. Sir. Whats this? Bacon and sausage sandwich? - Yes, sir. - Any mustard in it? - Yes, sir. - Good. Tell the cook l want jam roly-poly for my lunch. (Groans) You know the only cure for seasickness? - o. - A pint of seawater in a bucket. - (Weakly) Oh... - Old sailors remedy. - Care to try some? - o, thank you. All right. Just a suggestion. The pipes not pulling. Have you got a pipe cleaner? Could you clean it outside? - lts a bit strong. - Oh, lm sorry. (Cook sings) Oh, very nice, if l may say so, Mr Jenkins. You cook very nice. lts nice to be appreciated. A contented cook makes a contented crew. Oh, lm contented, all right. - Here, thats why. - Mmm? - Thats why. - Oh! (Laughs) Oh, thats Rosie, the wife.

Just not very hungry, thats all. Seasickness is entirely mental. lsnt that so, Mr Archer? - Yes, sir. - There are other reasons, sir. lts entirely mental. l know. When the ship goes up and down or from side to side, people want to vomit, and, by jingo, they do, but its entirely mental. Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir. - Mr Whimble. - Sir? - This fish, Mr Whimble. lts bad. - lt cant be, sir. - Doctor? - l havent tried mine yet. Well, taste it now. Dont wait for us all to be poisoned. - Would you excuse me? - There! And he didnt even taste it. - Chuck it all over the side. - What, now?

Athletes foot? l dont know any athletes. ow, this was made up special by the Doctor hisself. What do l do with it? What do you...? Oh, you rub it on thrice daily after meals. - After meals. - Hmm. Hello, Second. - Whats the matter? - Good morning, Doctor. Extraordinary. Touch of pes planum. Cant think how l got it. - l used our ointment. - Easter, you are an idiot. - Anyone waiting? - Yes. Thousands. - Line them up and send them in. - Righto, Doc. lts astonishing. Doctor, it feels better already. Three times daily. Shall l? Oh, yes. Certainly. lf you think itll do any good. Do me any good?! Good gracious me! lts wonderful stuff. Oh, l dont need that. All right. First one. Come in, Wilson. Sit down. ow, what seems to be the trouble? lts my chest, Doc. Feels as if somethings pressing on it. Take off your shirt. What sort of pressing? l dont quite know, but its suffocating, especially at night. Lets have a look. - Something pressing on it? - Yes, Doc. lm not surprised. lt must be the cannon balls. Well, just flex your muscles and breathe naturally. - Whats going on? - Chippies having one of his turns. Look at that one with the two heads and green eyes! - Better go after him. He looks bad. - Hell be in his cabin by now. (Mutters maniacally) - Cor, hes violent. - Er, now, come on. - Get away from me, you swine! - lm here to help you. - Get away! - Whats the trouble? lts them dogs, them Alsatians. Five ruddy great green ones! This man has DTs. Oh, hes had them for years. Hes been on the booze since we left. lt makes him sad leaving Wapping.

Up. What is it? What? Have a nice drink of this. ltll make you feel better. - Feel better? - (Sighs) Yes. How many Alsatians can you see now? one. Theyve all gone. Good. ow, down you go. There you are. - Thank you. - Doc? Yes? Heres three lovely little spaniel puppies. Thank you. You can have the bitch. (Both grunt) Yes, itll have to come out, Corble. - How are we for dental equipment? - Weve got pliers, sir. - There must be some forceps. - Theyre old-fashioned. - How about string and a doorknob? - Dont be an idiot. - How about anaesthetic? - Got ether. Doctor, ether makes me sick. (Shouts) And no ones going to use it on me! - What about medical comforts? - That lm in favour of. Well, Doc... Heres how. Come on, Doc. Lets get cracking. Yes. Come on. (Laughs) Come on. Open. Come on. Wide. Wider. ow... Hold it. Hold on. Hold on. (Mutters anxiously) (Screams) - Am l interrupting? - Were extricating a molar. (Simon) Come in. Do you mind the sight of blood? - Blood? o, not a bit. - Good. ow, come along. Well just try again. Open. (Shouts in pain) (Wails of agony) lm sorry. This is going to hurt a bit, l think. Easter, apply some counter-pressure to his shoulders? Hurry up. (Easter) Put your knee on his chest, Doctor. Knee on his chest. Like that? ow your elbows against his shoulders. - Thats right. ow pull. - How can l, you idiot? - Turn it upside down. - l cant do that. lm sorry. Once again, open up. Pull, Easter, pull! lm...lm sorry, Doc. l...l hope l didnt hurt you. Oh, no, no. ot at all. Look. Well, Trail, what can l do for you? lm quite all right, Doc. Much better. Much better. Thought l had a slight toothache. All gone. Come on. Wakey-wakey! Oh, take it easy, Doc. lts far too hot. Youre going to need all your energy when we put into port at Bellos.

Sick report, sir. - o time to dress this morning? - l beg your pardon, sir? - Youre naked. - Am l, sir? l didnt notice. - Your button, Doctor. - Oh. - Take care in the tropics. Heat does strange things to people. l remember when l went Third. The First Officer thought he was Cleopatra. Very awkward for all hands, sir. We were near the ile. That may account for it. Yes, sir. l shall watch myself for any symptoms. And there was your predecessor Flowerday. Poor fellow. However, lets have a look at this sick list. McGlusky, insomnia. What does he think you can do about that? Perhaps he thought l was Cleopatra, sir. - Whats PUO? - Pyrexia of unknown origin, sir. ld be obliged if youd speak English. - He has a temperature, sir. - Why? - l dont know. - You ruddy ought to. Youre the doctor. What if l didnt recognise a lighthouse? Well, its hardly the same, sir. - A lighthouse sticks up for miles. - Dont be impertinent. (Horn blasts) Bellos. lt looks a wonderful place, Easter. - l suppose youve been before. - Yes. lts a pretty spot but it has some distressing memories, you might say. The late Dr Flowerday was very fond of it. Easter, what did happen to Dr Flowerday? Oh, very melancholy, it was. He was in a hurry to get ashore one day when we were in the harbour. Oh? Well, he had ideas above his station. He tried to walk. Oh! (Shouting, horn blasts) o, you naughty boy! l dont want to kiss you! Hey! Hey! Blast! Too fast an acceleration, Harry, eh? l havent got the pick-up that l used to have. Family model. Catch her when she parks. Chicken... Two! (Gargles) Sword swallow. Hocus-pocus. One, two, three, go. - Stick it, boss. - Dont be so darned silly! Easter, back at your old job, eh? Yes, l like hair cutting. Bit of an art. Like sculpture. You never know how its going to turn out. - Ouch! - Oh, was that your ear, Doc? lf l get a septic wound, lll brain you. Sterilised, Doctor. We of the medical fraternity look after our tools. The Violet come in astern of us last night. - The Violet? - Yes, sister ship. Captain Beamish. - He and the old man hate each other. - Yes. Professional rivalry. Both think that theyve got the best ship. - You wouldnt fancy a crew cut, Doc? - o, l would not. (American accent) Hiya, Doc. lm off the Omar C lngersoll down the docks. - Drapers the name. - How are you? l know l shouldnt bust in but your Chief Mate said it was OK. What can l do for you? l just want a pack of aspro. Were clear out. - l dont want to be any trouble - o trouble at all. Here. l brought you these in exchange. Oh...yes, thank you. Pop over for a cup of coffee some time. - Just ask for me. - Oh, thats very nice of you. Er, what exactly... l mean, what do you do aboard? lm the Captain. - Hi. - Hello. All set? l wonder where he gets his shirts? - The same place you get your ties. - Do you like it?

Going ashore, Second? lm not visiting the engine room. Take it easy. lts a very wicked city. lf you find fun among the dregs of humanity, it doesnt follow that all officers wish to do the same. lts a girl. ever go ashore with Second, Doc. He never stands a round. Just going over to Violet to pay a call on Captain Beamish. Keep the men in order. lf anyone smuggles a woman aboard, clap him in irons. Spending your evening in a shop window, Mr Archer? - Good evening, sir. - Good eve... Hello, Chippie. Taking the Alsatians for a stroll? What are you talking about? You know, them ruddy great green ones. - Have you been drinking? - Oh! Hark at you! (Barks and whines) Drink. Softens the brain in the end. Hope youve locked your cabin. These chapsll pinch anything. - Dont the police keep an eye out? - Theyre too busy gambling. Theyll arrest you first chance they get. - Steer clear of them, Doc. - Thanks for the warning. (Whistles) l say. What a smashing-looking girl. l wonder who that belongs to? Hello. l wonder if youd mind giving us a lift into town? Rosita! Rosita, my dear. l hope l havent kept you waiting. Captain Hogg, sir. Well?! Whats the matter with him, Beamish? Scurvy or something? Miss Mallet, this is Captain Hogg. Good evening. Well, you are a surprise. l never expected a dear little beard. - Really, madam... - This is Sir Arthurs daughter. Oh. lve been a passenger all the way from Lima. lts been so exciting. lm a landlubber, really, and being at sea has been such a thrill. - lndeed? - Captain Beamish has been so kind. l think sailors get lonely without a little feminine company, dont you? l havent noticed it, madam. ow, Captain, you mustnt be strong and silent with me, or l shall tell my father. Well, perhaps they are inclined to fret a little from time to time. Fret? Oh, what a sweet way of putting it. Captain, wont you offer Captain Hogg a drink? - Of course. - Pour me a teeny one, will you? Captain Beamish is going to take me out and show me the sights. ow, dont you slip away while lm gone. (Laughs) l cant help feeling sorry for you, having that for the whole voyage. Chairmans daughter or not, ld wring her neck. Whats this? Thats a cable from the Chairman, saying that youre to sign her on now and take her home. - By Christopher, l wont! - The Chairman says you will. (# Cha-cha) # Do you love me?

Well, its, erm... out of the frying pan into the fire. Simon, you speak too quickly. Please, speak in French. l dont know the French for frying pan.

You neednt think about me. - Well, sir, l had to as a doctor. Violent exersise is very dangerous with your complaint. Dont play for time... What complaint? You have Higginbottoms disease, sir. - o, l do not. - Oh! l suppose they were afraid to tell you. ow. Mm-hmm... Oh, dear. lm afraid its all too obvious. - Yes. The symptoms are all there. - Poor Daddy. Would you put your arms above your head? - o, l wont. - Hurts, does it?

Wilson and Merritt, found fighting, contrary to Article 1 7 of the Merchant avy Act. ow, l want to make one thing perfectly clear to you two. Youre getting a fair hearing this morning. Youre free to ask questions of me or other officers, and you may call witnesses in your defence. l believe a man is innocent until hes proved guilty. - Do you hear that? - (Both) Yes, sir. Very well. ow you tell me your version of the story. Well, it was like this, sir. We were having a cup of tea... You flaming liar! You were drunk! - Who? Me, sir? - Who me? Of course you were. Dont answer back! Cup of tea! What do you take me for? l was at sea when the marks of the cradle were still on your... - Mr Hornbeam, they were fighting? - Yes, sir. Doctor, you found these men drunk? - Well, sir, tests... - The Doctor agrees with me. You were soused! Do you know what ld like to do with you? ld like to clap you in irons till we get back to port. ld like to lash you to the mast - STAD UP STRAlGHT! - and flog the living hide off you! Thats what you scum deserve. You dozy, idle, loafing, illegitimate cut-throats. All right. Fined five shillings. Good morning. All right. Get out. lsnt it a lovely morning? Exquisite morning, sir. This isnt a pleasure cruise. Tell Mr Hornbeam to get that cargo stowed. - lt looks like a bundle of knitting. - Er... Aye, aye, sir. Mr Hornbeam? Mr Hornbeam, l wonder if youd mind...? - Hornbeam, get that cargo secured! - (Hornbeam) Aye, aye, sir. Captain Beamish didnt have nearly such a pretty bridge as you, Captain. You know, it would nice if you had some ivy in pots, sort of trailing over everything, wouldnt it? - Your father wouldnt approve. - Daddy does what l suggest. - He calls me his ideas girl. - l can see why. Get out of my way! Dont you ever feel isolated up here, Captain? - o, Miss Mallet. - Oh. Of course you have the seagulls, l suppose, but you cant have nice, cosy chats with them, can you? - Oh, may l ask a favour, Captain? - Of course, Miss Mallet. - May l drive it for a little? - Drive it?! Daddy says every woman should know how to. Oh, does he? Quartermaster, Miss Mallet will take over. - Aye, aye, sir. - Oh, thank you. Mr Fellowes. Mr Archer. Send the Doctor to me at once. Mr Archer, attend Miss Mallet in the wheelhouse. Oh, is there a Highway Code or something l should read first? Oh, Mr Archer, dear, which are the brakes? - Brakes? - Of course. (Mumbles) Good morning, sir. You sent for me? lts about this woman Mallet, the one with the teeth. - Shes pursuing me. - l hadnt noticed, sir. Dont be such a confounded liar. You know lm a calm, reasonable sort of man, but she might drive me to lose control of myself. - Really, sir? - lts an awkward situation for me. - What are you gonna do about it? - l dont know what l can do. Give her a pill to make her sleep for a fortnight. Wouldnt that be difficult to explain to the prospective patients father, sir? Yes, l hadnt thought of that. But this cant go on. The womans obsessed! - l could try psychiatry... - l dont want that muck on my ship! Youd better give me something. Something in the nature of a...love potion, sir? To make the obsession mutual? Dont be disgusting. o, something to calm my nerves. Make it strong. A sedative. lt might also calm your temper. - l havent got a temper! - All right, sir, but dont drink alcohol at the same time, otherwise youll be excessive... excessively drunk, and the consequences could be disastrous. Very well. Send it up right away and see its good. Yes, sir. Excuse me, Doc, but Father - the Captain - wants another box of pills. - Another? - Yes, sir. Oh, well. All right. ice and quiet, Mr Hornbeam. - Yes, sir. Very. - Restful, eh? Yes, sir. Your new pills, sir. Thank you. Put them in my cabin, will you? l dont need them today.

Good morning, Captain. Come to sunbathe? - l do not sunbathe. - You should. lts so good for you. Daddy does whenever he can. You might find somewhere less public! Oh, how sweet of you. Well come up on the bridge. Go along, darling. (Groans) Sir. Thanks, Doc. - ext, please. - ext, please. ext? What is the matter with you? - lm stuck. - Stoker Corble, sir. Stuck. - Stuck? - Stuck. There l am, Doctor, stoking, minding my own business, when suddenly l get stuck, just like this - look. - You cant stand up straight? - o. What we of the medical fraternity call a sloppy disc. o, it isnt. Easter, go and stand round there. ow, put your hands on Easters shoulders and try and stand up straight. - Hurt? - o. Cant feel a thing. - Did you feel that? - Yeah. lt tickles. Easter. Come here. Get underneath and take the strain. ow, look, you push up, and lll try and pull. Right? Shall l get the chief engineer to fix up a block and tackle? o, l dont think thats necessary. Hey, Doc, lm not going to be left this way for keeps, am l? The wifell think lm taking the mickey. Youll be all right in a jiffy. Easter, get me some oil, will you? To rub him down with. This needs loosening up. - Weve got some castor oil. - Anything will do. Thank you. Miss Mallet pinched the olive oil for her bains de soleil, as the French say. (Creaking) Good morning. Good morning, miss. Er... Thanks, Doc. You fixed me fine. What can l do for you? Well, lve had a little backache, but its all right. lm sure we can find something wrong with you. (Coughs) Oh! ow, then. How about a little pink gin? There, Miss Mallet. lve rubbed almost everything. Thank you. lt feels lovely. Captain, hello. You dont mind my borrowing your officer, do you? As far as lm concerned, you can keep him. As a deck officer, l have always thought hed make a good greaser. Oh! Dont worry. He doesnt really mean it. othing l do seems to please. There you are. Drink it down. ltll do you good. This is the first time lve ever drunk pink gin in a medicine glass. l wish l could say the same. Bonne chance. - You have no work? - Business is not brisk today. - Do you enjoy it? - What? The job? Oh, l dont know. Quite. lm afraid some of them dont think much of me. - They think lm a landlubber. - Quoi? Er... A little bit green. - Oh. - You cant blame them, really. Why do you do it? l developed what is known as an allergy. What to? Feathers or something? o, to hungry girls in glasses called Wendy. Oh, l see. Are you better now? Oh, yes. lm much better, thank you. lts usually the doctor that does the questioning. - Oh, l am sorry. Go ahead. - Well, um... Are you allergic to anything? Er...ships doctors, for example? l havent noticed it. (Door opens) - Excuse me, Doc. lts urgent. - lf its the cook, cut him down. o, its old Harry. He doesnt look good. He says his belly - pardon - his abdomen hurts. All right. Will you excuse me? (Hums happily) Excuse me, sir. Sir, do you think we can go a little faster? - Why? - lts old Harry, sir. Hes got an acute appendicitis. l must get him to hospital. - Why? - For an operation, sir. You know l cant make port for at least three days. - Youll have to operate yourself. - Me, sir? - Youre the doctor. - Well... - Thats what youre paid for. - lm not the surgeon. l dont care. lll have no dead quartermasters aboard my ship. - Operate yourself. Thats an order. - Very well, sir. lf you want any nurses, lm sure the ladies will oblige. Oh, with pleasure. Scrub it down thoroughly, and then sterilise the instruments. Yes, Doctor. - Ever given an anaesthetic? - Yes, Doc. Once in the Red Sea... - Yes, all right. - Are you a bit nervous, Doctor? Well, as a matter of fact l am. Maybe a little medical comfort, sir? Afterwards. lm going to get some more bulbs. Do what you can here. Easter! - How do you lay em out? - Lie on it. lll show you. Hands on your chest, now, like this. Hell slip off this like a wet fish. - Very dignified. Look. - Smooth as a babys bottom. othing like a good burial at sea for dignity, l say. Hello, Doc. Just taking precautions. So l see. Here. Hold this. Dont forget, two waves and hes kicked the bucket. Then you lower away to half-mast. Good morning, Doc. - Good morning. - Dont take it too hard, will you? OK. Forceps. o, the others. Whats Harrys chances, Chippie? Oh, l dont know. l dont think this Docs ever done a job like this. All right, Doc? Yes. Yes, l think hell do. Hes all right. A good pulse. o sign of infection. lt would have come by now if was going to. Simon, why dont you go to bed? You havent had any sleep for a long time. o, not yet. l must wait till lm quite sure. - Do you want some more coffee? - Hmm? Oh, yes. - Youre a very good nurse, you know? - Youre a very good doctor, l know. Oh, excuse me, Doc. Theres someone to see you. Special. Oh, for Petes sake! Give him a couple of aspro. Tell him to come back tomorrow morning. Easter, all right, send him in. lll see him. Theres more than one, Doc. Oh? All right. Doc says come in. Well? Sir, representing the crew of the SS Lotus of the Fathom Line, weve taken the liberty to come here and express our gratitude for what youve done for old Harry there. You see, were all very fond of old Harry, and er... lts our opinion, nem. con., that youre a proper ships doctor to have done that, seeing what a pickle he was in. And so, sir, wed like you to accept this small token of our esteem. - Thats yours, Sandeman. - ld like you to have it, Doc. Thank you. l... (Bird chirrups) Thank you, very much. You see, sir, we felt that... (Twitters) Are you glad they have given you the bird? Er, yes, in a way. l seem to have won 33 and six from you, Captain. - Shall l add it to the list? - lf you please. What are those pills you keep taking? - Theyre for headaches. - Oh, do you have one? - l have on this trip. - You worry. About your promotion, perhaps? Oh, lm sure you neednt. Somehow, l can see the one thick stripe on your arm. Commodore Hogg of the Fathom Line. l wonder if Daddy could see it, too? Yes. Commodore Sir Wentworth Hogg. Yes. Yes, it suits you. Very kind of you to say so, lm sure. Theres just one teeny thing against it perhaps. Youre not married. Steamship lines do like their Commodores to be married. lt seems to make them more stable. l know Daddy feels like that. Oh, well. l must go and tidy up. Thank you for the game. lt was lovely...Wentworth. (Hums Wedding March) Good evening, Mr Archer. Lovely evening. Yes, indeed. ls the Captain engaged? Engaged? l think its a little too soon...

Well, weve got a ships rail, a calm sea, moonlight, you and me, the end of a voyage. - All we need is a celestial choir. - You sound sad. Well, l am sad. What happens to you now? l will take some holidays, and after, go on working somewhere. And you? lm staying on with the ship. Theyre bound for Rio, and lve never seen Rio. - Are there any frying pans in Rio? - Hundreds, l should think. Why dont you come with me and find out? l dont think ld be a very good doctors wife. l wouldnt be very good in cabaret. l could learn tricks from Easter.

(Harry) Mind, lve got water on the knee. - Youll get water on the head. - (Archer) Where are the women? - Miss Mallet? Miss Colbert? - Whats the trouble, Mr Trail? - Oh, dont worry. - Maybe the steering gears worn out. Dont panic! Please dont panic! Come on. Lower away there! Ships going down!
