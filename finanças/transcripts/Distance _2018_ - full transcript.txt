--== McEphie ==-- Do you want some tea? Don't bother. It’s really cold outside. When did you arrive? I should have picked you up at the airport. You don’t answer my calls. Even if I called you, you wouldn’t pick up. I’m kidding. I’m okay. You’ve lost so much weight. Your sister has been calling you. I know. I haven’t returned her calls. Call her. She’s worried about you. What are you really doing here, Anton? I’m here to take you home. Look, I didn’t change anything. I didn’t make any renovations, so nothing has changed. Ma’am Liza! Ma’am! You still look beautiful! And you’re still here, Rose. Of course. I’ve missed you so much. Have you seen the kids? Rose, please take Liza’s stuff inside. Okay, sir. And have you changed the sheets in the room? Yes, sir. All of them. -Even the towels in the bathroom. -Okay, good. Take her stuff to the master’s bedroom. Yes, sir. -Ma'am, let me take your bag. -Thank you. Help me carry these. They’re heavy. You can stay in the master bedroom. I’ll transfer to the guest room. It’s much more comfortable in the master bedroom. Yay! You're going to pick me up? We’re going to pick up your sister. Liz. I was going to your room. Do you need anything? What about you? Do you need anything? I am going to pick up the kids. Okay. Do the kids know I’m here? Let me take care of it. Take care. Let’s have dinner. Sit over here. I thought you guys are hungry. Come on, dig in. Karla here is already in college. Last semester, she was on the dean’s list. But she’s too busy with her theater group. She devotes more time to it than her classes. She just loves the group that much. Maybe too much. They give her too much work. It leaves her exhausted. That’s what’s important, right? So, how are you? I’m fine. I’m glad you’re home. We missed you. Is she still going to eat? She probably just wants to rest. Papa, how long is she going to stay here? We can do this some other time. It’s so pretty. Yes, it’s beautiful. Is Mama going to put up the stars next time? I’m sorry. I thought you were Papa. I’m fine. Did Rose use up all the groceries? I hope you don’t mind. I used the kitchen. You own everything in this house, too. Therese. When I come home, will she still be there? Until when? When you said she needs to be here with us, what did you mean, Papa? Stop it! -Don’t put those back! -Where are you going? Where are you going? How many times are you going to forgive me? Therese. You’re home. Do you want to eat? I prepared something for you. That's all right. Thank you. Come on. It’s just a light snack. Come eat with me. Okay. Is this still your favorite? Yes. Go ahead, eat. But this isn’t the first time she cheated on me. For some reason... I have a feeling she’ll change. But the fact that the same thing keeps happening... gets me so frustrated every time. We don’t know how they will react. What if they rebel against you, or even worse, what if they follow in the footsteps of their mother? They might think it’s okay. They need a decent mother figure. -What are you talking about? -And that’s definitely not your wife. -Definitely not. -But she’s still their mother. Are you going to let her go just like that, big brother? You're her husband. Fight for her. -If not for you, do it for the kids. -"For the kids"? Why? Did she respect her kids? Did she respect you, Anton? Please, please. No! I'm not disrespecting you, but no, she did not! This is so disgusting. It makes me want to vomit... Stop it! Please! I know you are all concerned. I have to think about this carefully, especially for the kids, but... All I can think of right now is that... the woman I love is not coming back. That's it. And I cannot move forward from that. That's it. That’s all I can process for now. I took a leave of absence because I was madly in love with a woman whom I did not end up getting. Don’t follow in my footsteps, okay? For our newbies, I’m really bad with names. So, please remind me what your names are. Before we all graduate, I would have memorized all of them. I hope you guys are all excited. Are you excited? That’s all. Thank you. Adi! Did you run away from home? It feels like it. For real? I was kidding. I just moved into my new dorm. I’m still grabbing stuff from my house. Let me help you. My dorm is far from here. I can manage. No, I insist. I’ll just text the driver to pick me up there. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Let me get your luggage. Let’s go. Someone still picks you up at school? Papa wants to know where we are all the time. If he doesn’t have the time, he asks the driver to pick us up. -Strict? -No. Just protective. I have a question for you, Anton. What do the children know? I just disappeared from their lives. Papa. Big sister. Therese. Mama. Papa? Are we going to hang Mama’s sock? Is she going to come home? When you’re angry with a person, you stop looking for them, right? So then the person no longer has to explain why she left. I didn’t know I was going to come back, Anton. But you’re here now. You’re still awake. Pa. I can’t sleep. If Papa calls, please tell him I miss him. -Good night. -Here. Sorry. Here’s your lunch. Karla, here’s your lunch. Thank you, but I won’t be able to eat that. Someone asked me to give this to you. Let's open it. What does it say? "Thank you for taking me home last night and sharing stories with me." "Heart, A." -So, who’s your new victim? -You’re crazy. Wow, a cupcake. He probably wants something in return. What are you talking about? I just know how guys make their moves. I’m sure he wants to win your heart. I’m just saying, be careful. Jolo, you can have it. What? Hello. I’m here to pick you up. The driver isn’t available. Is it okay if we go to the mall first? I need to buy something. -Sure. -Okay, let's go. Where else do you want to go? Nowhere, thank you. I'm all right. I’m sorry. You probably got tired from all the walking we did. I had fun. Maybe you want to go out again another time? We can go back to the mall. But only if you want to. Okay. See, I told you. It looks like we’re going to a dance. That means we’re going to stand out. I’m still so full, I might burst. Let me see. I don’t think so. Hi, big sis. Do you want to see what I bought? Hi, Karla. I’m going to take these to my room. Me, too. Big sis. Baby, Ira told me you’re holding a fundraiser at school? Yes, we are. Do you know the final date? So I can plan ahead and take the day off. Why? Papa’s going to come with you? Then who? Mama. I just don’t want you to get hurt. Liz? I should wear something beautiful. This is the first time her classmates and the parents are going to see me. Whatever you wear, you’ll still look more beautiful than all of them. And Therese just had to see that you were trying. By the way, I had lunch with your sister. She wants to see you. Maybe you can agree to meet her once? I can come with you if you do meet with her. I’ll be your buffer. If you’re not comfortable, just invite her here. This is your territory, anyway. Did you tell her I was doing all right? But you know your sister. She’ll keep worrying until she sees you. I’m worried about you, too. Are you all right? Can we talk about this some other time? Once I know the answer. What’s the matter? I don’t keep track of all your mistakes. But you won't fool around when you’re in my home and near my kids. Anton, what are you talking about? I love you, Liza. But I’m not stupid. If you don’t love me anymore, I’m asking you to at least respect me. Papa, I had to move my appointment with the shop making my gown to next week. Sorry, I’m just super busy. I don’t have a dress anyway. I have to go. You’re leaving already? I’m having a hard time reaching out to Karla. I know that she doesn’t like me. Maybe so. You don’t have to force it. She’s still not used to having you around. It’s just frustrating that there’s nothing else I can do about it but wait. Elizabeth! Big sister. I missed you! I missed you, too. Thank you, Anton, for convincing her to see me. Why weren’t you answering my calls? Thank you. I have been calling you. You were ignoring my calls. Liza, you shouldn’t be doing this alone. It’s just the two us. You can confide in me. I want to be there for you. But what am I supposed to do? Fly all the way to see you? Jesus Christ! By the way, how are you? Let’s eat first. There’s plenty of food. We already ordered earlier. Liza and I were hungry. -This is a lot of food, Anton! -Dig in. Let’s eat. Here you go. Adi, you're so natural. Right? I hope we get some awards tomorrow. Yeah. Hey, where are you going? Excuse me. Hey, congratulations. Hey. Congratulations to you, too. Have a drink. I don’t drink on a school night. I’m going to drink it all up if you don’t take it. I thought that lunch was never going to end. My sister wouldn’t stop talking. I know. She just really missed you. She probably just missed scolding me. I wanted to get out of there. But your sister wouldn’t let me. Thank you so much, Anton. If you weren’t there, I would probably still be stuck with her for the next week. That’s true. My sister is just too much. She’s impossible, isn’t she? -And she finished all the food. -Yeah, I know. You know, I’m pissed at you. Why? You’re so fickle. I don’t get you. Are you a Virgo? How did you know? So you really are a Virgo? Yeah. I knew it. You’re so indecisive. You don’t know what you want. You’re full of crap. -Why? Do you always know what you want? -Yeah. -All the time? -Yeah. I’m a Sagittarius. So we know what we want. All the time. Liz. What? Maybe not like before. Where is this all coming from, Anton? Aren’t you getting tired? I do get tired. But I recharge, and then I’m all good again. And here I am. I do nothing but keep hurting you. And all you do is keep on accepting me. Accept and love you. Even if you say we’ve been here before. I will never get tired of doing it. But... Liz... think of the girls. I don’t want them to wake up and find out that you’re gone again. You’re going to cut yourself. Don’t touch that. Jeez, Karla. Maybe a little. How did you get home? I took a taxi. I’m sorry. Karla, drink some water so you'd feel okay. I'll throw up. Do you want to talk? I don't need to explain to you. -Good night. -Here. Sorry. if you’d like to, you can stay here until next week. But it looks like you don’t want to. Whatever. You might be thinking that I’m just playing with you. That I already did this in high school. And I’m just using reverse psychology on you. If you don’t want to, then fine. Are you sure I don’t want to? You don’t want to. Such a snob. No, I’m not. I just feel light-headed. You were such a show-off last night. I need to go to class. Bummer. It might not look good on him. I hope you can join me again at my next event. You don’t like it? Everything. That was fun, wasn’t it? Thank you for taking me. Karla, you’re here. ADI Hi - Can we talk tomorrow? Just forget about what happened. Let’s not talk about it. -Is there a problem? -Nothing. I just thought about what you said. That I should exert more effort in reaching out to Karla. So, I was thinking, maybe I can pick her up from school later. That’s fine with me. Are you sure? I thought that maybe it would be better if she sees I’m really trying. She’s at rehearsals. Can you wait for her? But can you text me where to pick her up exactly? Good luck. Take care. You can meet her at the theater. Why are you all by yourself? Why are you talking to me? I thought we should forget about it? I don’t know how to do this, Adi. -I already told you... -All I know is I like you. that it’s too late for me to run away from it. I told your Papa I was going to pick you up, so we can spend time together. Just the two of us. The girl you were with, is she your classmate? You were there the whole time? No. Just a little bit. She’s in my group. You should’ve offered her a ride home. Where does she live? Karla, maybe you can introduce your friend to me next time. I know what you’re thinking. You’re wrong. We’re not the same. -I just want to get to know your friend. -What do you want? Why are you really here? I won’t listen to you because you don’t have a clear understanding of what’s right or wrong. You don't even know the most basic thing. That you shouldn’t hurt someone who loves you. Hey, hey. What’s going on here? She’s here, but we don’t know until when. We’re trying to be okay with it. But no one’s telling us where she’s been for the past five years. Why did she leave? What is she doing here? Why did she come back? What does she want from us? She will answer your questions when she’s ready. Okay? When will that be? You have no idea what your mom went through while she was away. Don’t speak to her like this. You think I didn’t want to hug you when I saw you again? You think I didn't want to tell you that I love you, Mama? Don’t leave us again. I’m so tired of being angry. I just want to forget everything. Then we can just eat. Tell jokes. Go shopping. As if nothing ever happened. But that’s unfair! Because no matter how hard I try, I can’t forget it. Karla. Papa brought me up well. He taught me how to forgive. But you never said sorry! Karla. You do nothing but cook and prepare lunch. You want everything to magically be all right. But you gave no explanation! Now, you’re putting Papa in this situation again. You never said sorry once since you came back. You cheated on Papa. You chose Auntie Jen. You abandoned us all for Auntie Jen. You left us... without even thinking about us. You didn’t choose us! That's okay. Wipe your tears now. Therese. My child! You know there are ways so you don’t have to lose your hair. You’re overconfident. Liz. Babe, don’t say that. Just after you've... ...given up everything, only to lose me, too. Jen! Jen! Jen! We can’t run away from this. I can’t do anything about it. Did you ever wish you loved someone else instead of me? Never. Many people told me... that my love for you is a tragedy. But, you know, I saw this as something beautiful. I know you understand what I’m talking about because you also had this kind of love. You had it once. I had it once. She’s gone. You have no reason to go back. Have I told you? What? Can you please pass me the tomatoes?
