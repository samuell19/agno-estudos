"Compared to the history of mankind, fascism happened as long ago as a second of my lifetime. Just one second. But if the Germans think that this one second is so far in the past, they don't have to think about it anymore, I feel sorry for them. The present is nothing other than the result of the past." Thomas Brasch. THE BRASCH FAMILY "A taxi took us into Manhattan on the Expressway. I saw the skyline. I was in New York. I couldn't believe it. So there I lay, looking through the half-open sliding window at the house opposite. Its fire escapes and air conditioning units looking exactly like the houses I knew from American movies. 'How clichéd,' I thought, 'even the soundtrack is right.' "WE'LL BE QUIET NOW", NOVEL I dozed for a while, and, as the outside world started to blur in my head, the phone rang." I got an e-mail from Rainer about some "tough Friday topics." But I'm not even there. I guess you don't know what it means either? Today's Friday, isn't it? The actual reason for my visit is an event organized by Deutsches Haus AUTHOR at New York University. They invited me to do a reading from my novel. Each family story is told by each family member. Each family member tells their own version of the story. And I'm telling m y own version. I'm the last one left to tell it, but I want to share my own very subjective story. So I was thinking, where should I start? With the period of time I can still remember. And that's childhood. "'What did you want to become when you were a boy, Daddy?' 'A priest,' he said. 'I wanted to become a priest.' 'But we don't believe in God, do we?' 'No.' 'Then why did you want to be a priest?' 'Because I still believed in God then.' 'And why not anymore?' 'That's a long story.'" BAVARIA Did you know Horst Brasch was a Catholic? Yes, of course I did. Would you mind telling us what you know about him? I know that Horst was born a Jew. HORST BRASCH'S NEPHEW He went on to be brought up by his stepfather, Curth Thesing, a biologist and publicist, who was a great influence. But it's correct to say that he spent the first part of his life in Bavaria. And he found it much easier to identify with Catholicism than with Judaism. My father was Jewish, although his status was Catholic. But he wasn't protected, unlike his mother, who was still married and protected by her husband who had some power. But m y father had to flee. He was 16 at the time, so not a young child anymore, which is why he was made an assistant on a Jewish child transport to England. 1938: IN THE WAKE OF NAZI POGROMS AGAINST JEWS OVER 10,000 CHILDREN WERE SENT INTO BRITISH EXILE. MOST OF THEM NEVER SAW THEIR PARENTS AGAIN. When the war broke out, they were detained in a camp in Canada as hostile foreigners. And according to how he'd always told it, he turned Communist there and swapped the Bible for the Communist Manifesto. "The story of how a Catholic Jew became a Communist was my dad's favorite. For me, it was the most boring story ever." I'd rather live on bread and water all m y life than go to war for even one single hour. And if we talk of liberating the German people from fascism in the GDR today, it's because our task hasn't been fully accomplished yet. He was like all the other party officials. He resented me because he thought I was a bad influence on his son. WRITER But he'd originally wanted to become a Catholic priest. I didn't know that, but the same applies to Stalin. Really? - Yes. Do you remember how you and Thomas met? I met Thomas in 1961. We were the same age, I think I'm half a year older than him. We very quickly became friends. We shared the same interests. We both wanted to become writers and were both writing. From the age of 17 or 18, we remained very close for many years. It was a very close friendship. I also got to meet his family. His mother, his two brothers, and little Marion who I thought was very cute. She used to romp around the flat. His brothers adored him. They were really happy when I chatted to them. Thomas was their focal point, and as the friend of their focal point, m y status with them was also... godlike. Back then, you both already knew you wanted to become writers? Yes, with the arrogance of 18-year-olds, it was obvious to us that we'd soon be the two most eminent German writers. "In a frenzied vision, my American friend described our imminent nights of uninhibited lovemaking if I came to visit him. I'd met Matthew in February of the year that would see my country disappear forever. When he waved at me in the airport lobby, I almost didn't recognize him. He was wearing a suit and tie, and looked very neat, almost bourgeois, not at all like I remembered him." We used to live on Alexanderstraße, in one of these 1960s blocks of flats near Congress Hall, in the very first one, 1 Alexanderstraße. It was quite privileged, but not outrageously luxurious. We had a living room, a master bedroom and two children's bedrooms. Who shared with who? I shared the large room with Peter, Klaus was in the smaller room, and my parents. And, as a child, how did you perceive your father? I never perceived my father as someone who was really high up in the party hierarchy. He was m y dad who happened to be picked up by a chauffeur. It was just a matter of course for me growing up. It meant nothing. Are you looking for us? I was here all along. I was just over there. That sounded like it was in m y key. I missed my cue. Not to worry. There were two parties that day I was invited to. One of them was at the children's theater and the other one at a certain Thomas Brasch's who I didn't know. All my friends went to that one. SINGER-SONG WRITER So I had to decide. I knew there'd be no booze at the children's theater, so I went to the other party. That's where I met him. It was near the end of the evening. There was an actress sitting on his lap. We looked into each other's eyes and then he took my hand. We were holding hands while the woman sat on his lap. That was kind of strange. Eventually, everyone left, but I didn't. And you were together. We were together. There may have been others involved. But that's how I understood it. Were you already singing then? Yes, I was. And you were already writing songs? I've been writing songs since I was 12. So, of course I was writing songs when I was 18. Apparently, he loved two of my songs right until he passed away. Which ones? - "The Daisies" and "Jan". I'd already written them back then. It was in the spring of 1966. PAINTER, WRITER I was 14 at the time. Thomas was seven years older than me, so that makes him... 21, is that right? At the beginning, it was a phase of great mutual affection. We were drawn to each other. We saw each other almost every day. He was the most intelligent person I had ever met until that point. What were you talking about? Books, the theater, films... politics... Socialism. Things we were interested in. I didn't think our age difference mattered. It wasn't an issue for me. The only thing was that he was involved with women which was alien to me. But that didn't really... bother me. Did you get to know his family at the time? Yes. Every time his parents went away, his two younger siblings were looked after somewhere else. He had a key to the flat and we used to live the high life there. So we stayed at Alexanderstraße, where the fridge was always full. They never had any cigarettes, only cigars. So we smoked them like cigarettes. So I knew the parents, but I didn't really know them, I'd met them. It was a very... frosty atmosphere. His father less so than his mother. His father took us on a boat trip once. His parents had a plot of land. I felt his mother was very... She was very cold. "I first ran away from home when I was four years old. I wanted to leave, to abscond. 'Abscond.' That was the word my mother used when she spoke of England. 'We absconded,' she said, and, eventually, she also told me about the time the Nazis forced her and her sister to clean the streets of Vienna using a toothbrush. Back then, it seemed like a game to me. The loser cleans the streets with a toothbrush, no big deal. And Nazis... Her soft Viennese dialect made the word sound as if they were a cute breed of dogs. But I did love the word 'to abscond.' I imagined my mother with all her earthly belongings, daringly swinging from one tower to the next, until she finally arrived in London. Gerda Brasch was my mother's sister. MOTHER Both from a Jewish family. They both lived in Vienna, and, fairly early on, when Austria was occupied by the Nazis in 1938, the entire family emigrated. They both went on to live in London. The sisters came from quite a wealthy background. Their parents owned a clothes store which they had to give up in a hurry. But the store still earned them enough money to enable them to get out of Austria fairly quickly. Do you know how they met? My father always told us... There were two versions. My father was always out... to convert others. He always took the lead in conversations. But, according to my mother, he was rather shy. He was too shy to go and talk to her. She went and talked to him, although my father claimed it was him who took the initiative. What brought them together, later on, was to establish the FDJ. 1939: IN LONDON, CHAIRED BY HORST BRASCH, THE FDJ GREAT BRITAIN IS ESTABLISHED. "HAVING BEEN EXPELLED FROM GERMANY, WE ORGANISED OURSELVES AS THE FREIE DEUTSCHE JUGEND, VICTIMS OF FASCISM." You could say that, to an extent, the FDJ was also a kind of surrogate family. Some of them shared a house together in London for two years, in a set-up we would almost call a veritable commune today. They met at this Jewish youth group in London. She saw this serious young man who was different to anyone else, who was a very good speaker, who had rhetorical talent and charisma, and she liked that. And she, too, became a Communist. Although I think she was never quite as passionate as he was. She did believe in Communism. She eventually followed him to Germany, but not until a year later, when she had given birth to Thomas. That was a difficult time. My father said, "Come on, we're moving to East Germany." And she replied, "Why would I go there? I'm from Vienna, I don't want to live in Germany." And his reaction was, "Fine, if you don't want to come, stay here on your own, with your son. I'm off to Germany." And, eventually, she followed him to Germany. 1946: THE FDJ IS ESTABLISHED IN THE SOVIET-OCCUPIED ZONE. FOUNDING MEMBERS ARE HORST BRASCH AND ERICH HONECKER. BOTH GO ON TO POLITICAL CAREERS WITHIN THE YOUNG STATE. What was he up to back then? "In 1948, the FDJ Secretariat appointed me Regional Chairman of the Brandenburg FDJ. I was reappointed to the Central Council, responsible for agitation and propaganda." He then became Regional Council Secretary in Cottbus. As a young man. Yes, sure. In 1952, he would have been... He was born in '22. So he was 30. They all came into these positions very young. There were no old ones, apart from Wilhelm Pieck. And what did she put? "In 1947, I became Secretary to the Chairman of the FDJ Central Council." That was Honecker. Did you have a normal family life like any other family? No. - Father, mother... It wasn't normal as all of us children were sent away. Thomas was sent to Cadet Corps. Klaus went to boarding school and I went to week nursery. Week nursery? You went there on Monday and came back on Friday. You were there all week as a small child, over a period of two years. There are theories and papers and books about the emotional damage children suffered from week nursery. I wasn't traumatized myself. I'm sure there were some who suffered, but I wasn't left traumatized myself. The parents didn't do it to get rid of their children. They thought the children were well looked after while they were establishing Socialism, without any detriment to the children. Thomas's father sent him to the Cadet Corps when he was 11 years old. I had no idea such institutions still existed, neither in East Germany nor in the West. I only knew Cadet Corps out of 1820s literature. The Cadet Corps was absolutely unbearable for Thomas. Thomas wrote harrowing letters to his father from Cadet Corps. "Daddy, Daddy, please..." But he just passed them to the Officer who was giving Thomas grief. His father passed them on to the Officer? Yes. Thomas wanted out. Ladies and Gentlemen. SECRETARY-GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF THE GDR Last night, the Soviet Premier Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev, in his great radio and television address, pointed out the great danger for world peace caused by certain circles within the imperialist U.S. and equally by the militarists and fascists who regained power in West Germany. AUGUST 13, 1961 CONSTRUCTION OF THE BERLIN WALL "TO PREVENT MIGRATION, ESPIONAGE, SABOTAGE, SMUGGLING, SELL-OUT AND AGGRESSION FROM THE WEST" Many intellectuals, including authors, hoped the Wall would bring more freedom, that somehow there would be more freedom of movement. Wolf Biermann wrote his play "Berlin Bridal Walk" glorifying the Wall. This attitude definitely existed. The best thing you can say about the GDR is that, for a while, some people thought they could make Socialism work there. Including you? - Of course. This was definitely something Thomas and I had in common. I mean, as a boy, I was a fervent Stalinist. I was like, 'We must be merciless." I was in favor of the Wall, for me it was the right thing to do. It was also important for the Stasi. The problem was they couldn't grasp that there were contradictions within their country that could cause criticism or even opposition towards the GDR. They assumed this was caused by external influences. They always blamed people reading Sartre and watching Western television. That was their only explanation. But most people's opposition stemmed from an unexpected source. It wasn't socialist enough for us. He moved further and further away from what his father had prescribed. His father looked for someone to blame for why Thomas distanced himself from his doctrines. And in me he found the ideal culprit. The son of a priest, a runaway, the boy from the West. Any unwanted literature he found on his son he thought I gave to him and so on. I'd become an enemy to him. And how was it for you? I took on the role of the child who was scared when they argued. I can hear myself say, "Be nice to each other." It's obviously traumatic for a child to witness the screaming and doors being slammed. It scares you, it's a serious loss, everything falling apart all of a sudden. Who was slamming doors? Everyone. Everyone was slamming doors. 1965: ERICH HONECKER'S GAIN IN POWER USHERS IN A NEW ICE AGE. HORST BRASCH IS PROMOTED TO DEPUTY MINISTER FOR CULTURE. BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED BANNED "TRACE OF STONES" Everybody was saying the film was going to be banned and that you had to be quick. We got in the queue. A friend, Peter Grünstein, came up to Thomas and said, "You're the crabs on the working class's scrotum." Thomas just smiled at him. Once inside the cinema, they had men strategically placed in the audience, instructed to shout at certain points, "Turn it off! Stop the film. Stop it!" So Thomas got up, he had a great voice, and addressed the auditorium. "Please, Comrades, be quiet now. After the film, we can all go outside and argue and discuss it." And it worked. Which cinema was it? The one near the Mokka-Milch-Eisbar. HORST BRASCH ENFORCES ERICH HONECKER'S URGENT MEASURES: AGAINST "NIHILISM, SKEPTICISM AND PORNOGRAPHY"AMONG YOUNG GDR ARTISTS. Some say he was really tough and pushed the measures through with an iron rod, while others say he prevented worse from happening. Eventually, I passed through evening college, did m y exams and made it into Film School. And Horst Brasch made sure I was removed from the school a week later. Really? - Yes. Is this anecdotal? No, I have evidence. By pure coincidence... One day, m y future mother-in-law, my girlfriend's mother, said I had to end my friendship with Thomas Brasch. I told her that was out of the question. She told me that a good friend of hers was in charge of personnel at the Ministry of Culture and had seen a letter by Horst Brasch in which he exposed me as the one who had led his son astray and made sure I lost my place at the Babelsberg Film School that I'd fought so hard for. Three months later, Thomas joined the Film School, taking up the place I had been removed from. His start was delayed, as the academic year had already begun. So he got m y place. And did you end the friendship? No, of course not. But I kept it secret from Thomas. And once you have secrets within a friendship, and quite important ones at that, it gets problematic. So this was the start of us distancing from each other. If you let me run through it, you'll find your cue. You need to listen. This is how we did it in m y kitchen. Sorry? You can rehearse backstage. Dance me till the end of love So when did you two break up? "You two?" It wasn't like that. He left me. After a year and a half. But you didn't want him to leave? - No. I still remember... Everything was decided. He was with the other woman, who he'd already been with while we were together, without m y knowledge. I remember standing by the stove in the Pankow flat, there was a stove, no central heating, thinking Thomas had left me, and the world was about to end. How far advanced was your pregnancy? I was already pregnant at the time. Maybe three or four months in. What I thought was quite funny was that he insisted on having an entry in his passport, "Son: Benjamin." I found it funny, because he wasn't really interested that much. GERMAN THEATER REHEARSAL STAGE "My older brother didn't turn up for m y seventh birthday. I only found out later that his son had been born on the very same day. The mother was a beautiful short-haired singer. She came over, cradling the baby in her arms and singing him a song. Benjamin, the clothes I'm in They're all I have, I am so poor She sang beautifully. I no longer resented m y older brother for not wanting to marry me. But I did resent him for not looking after her, leaving her with one dress." We're wondering whether we should just read it as a poem. Or maybe I can put you on loudspeaker and you'll sing it to Jasna, so she gets the melody. Would that be OK? Hello Marion. Hello Jasna. I just made up simple nursery rhyme melodies. I don't think it's the original melody. It goes like this, "Benjamin, the clothes I'm in They're all I have, I am so poor" So you just took him there in a buggy? Yes. I thought they'd look at him and say, 'What a cute boy." But the only one home was his mother. I guess she thought I'd come to make demands or for some financial or material help. I'm not sure. So I ended up with Marion's old crib. I really didn't need it. I just wanted to show him to them because I thought they might be interested. Did Thomas' father eventually get to see Benjamin? No. He wasn't in. The only time I went round to present him. There must have been a later opportunity. No. - He never saw his grandson? My granddad died three days before I was supposed to meet him. You were going to visit him with your father? I used to pester Thomas to take me, but somehow it never came about. Or maybe he didn't want to. Eventually, it was arranged, but it never happened. Did you learn anything at all about your grandfather? That he was an asshole. - Yes? I think so. To report your own son... You mean 1968? 1968: PRAGUE SPRING ATTEMPTS AT CREATING "SOCIALISM WITH A HUMAN FACE" ARE VIOLENTLY CRUSHED BY WARSAW PACT TROOPS I saw it as m y obligation. I knew it was an important day in the history of Socialism, so you had to take a stand, one way or another. So I talked about it to all of m y close friends, saying it had to be done. Although only very few did it. Did what? Protest against the invasion. FREEDOM FOR PRAGUE STALIN'S ALIVE GET OUT OF PRAGUE! A DUBČEK FOR EAST GERMANY! Thomas came to see me and said they'd been handing out flyers. The others had already been arrested. So he knew it wouldn't take long for him to be arrested. It was bound to happen. But he urged me not to do anything because of the baby. The way he told me the story is that he told his father and his father then left the house. He didn't phone from the apartment, but went to a phone booth, from where he called his Comrades or the police or maybe the Prosecutor. And then Thomas was arrested. In his parents' apartment? Yes, that's right. Thomas was also good at creating legends. The telephone was next door, in the study. He didn't need to go to a phone booth. And according to another version nothing happened at all. The Stasi already knew where he was. So then he was gone, he'd been arrested. I then sat down with a red pen and copied the other protesters' slogans onto A4 sheets divided into four, because I thought, if the same slogans kept being distributed... "Don't believe the papers' lies or you'll become complicit." "Stalin lives!" "Long live Red Prague! Long live DUBČEK!" These are the ones I can remember. If they kept being distributed, it would prove it can't have been them. However, being stupid as I was, they got me the next day. You distributed the flyers yourself? - Yes, I did. On your own? - No. I got some Dutch courage by having one beer, which was enough for me. In the bar, I met some friends, one of whom helped me distribute the flyers. STASI RECORDING COURT HEARING Tell me, is this appropriate behavior? To go about like a thief in the night creeping around the streets of the capital of the GDR, distributing such illegal incendiary slogans? Do you want me to reply? Is this right? Would you say this is open and honest behavior? I already tried to explain earlier, if I'd had the opportunity to go out and openly declare my opinion and what I think of it, I would have done so. But I knew this opportunity doesn't exist. So, because I can't go out and deliver a speech on the street, I thought I'd hand out bits of paper that summarize what I'm thinking. According to my evidence, people go out on a daily basis in the German Democratic Republic, and voice their opinions or write articles. Like I said, I knew which paragraph applied and that the prison sentence could be one to five years. Paragraph 106, "subversive agitation." And Thomas knew that too. Neither Thomas nor myself were victims. We were perpetrators. And being a perpetrator comes with a certain pride. Not all perpetrators, but some perpetrators are proud of what they did and willing to pay the price. It was very hard, being in a solitary cell. I was looking forward to the interrogations. Really? - Yes. Just to have a human being, to talk to. The interrogations progressed painfully slowly. The guy was sat at the typewriter to take the statements, first the question, then the answer... At some point I said, "Your typing skills are terrible. If it wasn't so absurd, you could let me have the typewriter and I'd do it." So he let me have the typewriter. Seriously? - Yes. They also had this tactic... My guy was quite friendly. They had this tactic of letting me see Thomas' report. Then I realized they could be very harsh. They wanted to show me they could use different methods than the friendly, "Have the typewriter." I'm not sure how it came about that the sentence was suspended, or that he was released after two and a half months. I don't know which circumstances led to him not having to serve the sentence. It only makes sense if you know the background story. FRIEND OF THOMAS BRASCH So we'd done this thing, we'd all gone to prison, the machinery had sprung into motion, and Ulbricht read about it in a Western paper or saw it on TV. The news was everywhere, that these... children... Party leaders' children. - ...had been arrested. Ulbricht went on to say, "These are our children." At the next politburo meeting, Ulbricht said to security chief Paul Verner, "Sort it out, Paul." Paul Verner still had an axe to grind with my father. So for him preparing the trial against us was an ideal opportunity, insinuating that people like Havemann and Biermann had been influencing these young people. Again, Ulbricht read about it in the papers, and he was fuming. He told Paul that wasn't what he'd meant. He'd wanted them out. So then m y brother, Roswitha and Thomas were released, but I wasn't. This was because of m y mother truthfully stating she had no educational power over me. That's how I ended up in Luckau. THOMAS BRASCH SPENDS THREE MONTHS IN PRISON. HIS SENTENCE OF TWO YEARS AND THREE MONTHS IS SUSPENDED. He always presented this as a huge accusation against his father. It was popular with Westerners who instantly understood this to be a big disgrace. But the two of us knew very well, and he also admitted this to me, that his father played exactly the villain's role assigned to him. My father was relieved from his position as Deputy Minister for Culture. RADIO PRESENTER With all the consequences this entailed, Karl-Marx-Stadt... He first went to the Higher Party School. And then, one and a half years later, he was sent to Karl-Marx-Stadt. Higher Party School? - The Higher Party School in Moscow. To be reeducated? - Pretty much. Although he always presented it as if it was a distinction that he was allowed to go to Moscow. But I believe it was a punishment. That's m y interpretation. Maybe it was a distinction, but why reward him for not being able to control his son? I find it unlikely. I never knew her as this relaxed, beautiful young woman. She simply wasn't happy. Because she couldn't live her dream. Her dream of being an artist, a singer or an actress. Instead, she wasted away at her husband's side. Being originally from Vienna, and having lived in London for years... To then have to follow her husband to Cottbus... or Karl-Marx-Stadt, where nothing ever happens- I'm sure this would have contributed to it. She certainly wasn't a genuinely happy wife. Whether she was a happy mother... I'm not sure, I wouldn't know. Going by the photographs I've seen, they seem to show a rather loving relationship. It's more a feeling of... of being distant. She was distant towards me. I wouldn't say she was cold. She also became ill quite soon and wasn't feeling well. She ran out of strength. I think she didn't have the strength to cope with her fourth child. That was you. - Yes, that was me. She was 41 at the time. In the eyes of others she may already have been an old woman. I knew Gerda... as a rather sad woman. Whether she already knew she didn't have much longer to live is impossible for me to say. It must have been in 1974. My mother was already in hospital. My father came home one evening, I'd already gone to bed. He came into m y room while I pretended to be asleep. He briefly sat down by my side and said "Farewell," which he'd never done before. Then he got up and left. I could tell by his steps that he went to his study. I was wondering what was going on. So I got up, sneaked out of m y room, through the living room to his study. He sat at his desk by the window, with his back to the door. I saw him writing. "I love life and don't think much of suicide. However, I've worked for the Party in good faith since 1940, and cannot carry on in disagreement with its leadership. This situation leaves me no choice. You may judge me. Yours, Horst Brasch. Please look after m y terminally ill wife, who's in the Party Hospital, and after my daughter (13) who's in m y flat. Horst." He then drove to the Regional Party Office where he kept a duty weapon in his locker, for whatever reason. But they stopped him as he was about to take it out. Because you called them? - Apparently. I'm not sure about the exact sequence of events. Anyway, they brought him back home. He was pale as a sheet. I also noticed that he was drunk. It must have been a terrible shock for you. Yes, of course. Did you try and talk to him about it? Yes, but he refused. Really? - Yes, he refused to talk about it. He was going to kill himself because his Party didn't love him anymore, leaving behind his sick wife and 13-year-old daughter. How desperate must he have been to even consider this? What was going on in his head? 1975: ERICH HONECKER BRINGS HORST BRASCH BACK TO BERLIN. HE APPOINTS HIM GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE FRIENDSHIP LEAGUE. He represented East Germany abroad. He traveled the world. He was very cosmopolitan and spoke fluent English. He was given this representative role. We moved to one of those tower blocks on Leninallee in Lichtenberg. My mother went straight back to hospital. From the one in Karl-Marx-Stadt... To the Party Hospital in Berlin. She saw the new flat, but then she died. She didn't get to move in. She died in 1975. "My brother's girlfriend told me she'd just played a princess in a fairy tale movie. A bitch, but playing bitches is fun, she said, smoking her cigarette. She looked great smoking. As cool as a guy, but still as elegant as a movie star." When he came out of prison, he was obliged to work at Oberspree cable factory ACTRESS, DIRECTOR where he spent two years working as a molding cutter, as an ordinary proletarian. He'd written lots of stories and had already compiled a huge volume of stories, "The Sons Die Before the Fathers." 1976: THOMAS BRASCH AND KATHARINA THALBACH ARE AMONG THE FIRST SIGNATORIES OF AN OPEN LETTER TO THE GDR LEADERSHIP. THEY PROTEST AGAINST THE EXPATRIATION OF SINGER-SONGWRITER WOLF BIERMANN. It became clear that it was banned, it wouldn't be published. Thomas then spoke to his father, asking him to arrange an audience with Honecker. So Thomas went to see Honecker and told him he wanted to stay, he wanted to do something for this country. But he was only able to do so if his work was appreciated here. If this wasn't the case, he'd rather go where his work was appreciated, or, in other words, where it could be published and read. Thomas also said that, if he was to leave, he'd like to go with the woman he was living with. Honecker told him to leave the manuscript with him, and that he'd be informed. The manuscript was then returned to him by mail. One word had been heavily underlined and followed by exclamation marks, a word that was already in there, "Banned." So it was decided. They immediately got in touch. We had officials visiting us with a long list of where we had to deregister and when to pack our things for Deutrans logistics. We were gone within a week. They basically kicked us out. "On a cold December morning in 1976, m y brother, his girlfriend and her daughter left the country. They soon found a flat in West Berlin and his book was published." Maybe you should mention the title again. "The Sons Die Before the Fathers." "'The Sons Die Before the Fathers.' With the book came the journalists, interviewing him, inviting him onto TV shows. 'Tell us how bad it was for you over there.' 'I want to talk about the book I wrote.' GERMAN THEATER BOX 'But they put you in prison, that must have been awful.' 'Being imprisoned is awful anywhere. I prefer to talk about m y work."' What shall we do after this last video? First, we fade to black and then the video starts. He was your uncle, wasn't he? Did you get to meet him? - Yes. Is it different to doing a play by someone else or working with a text by someone else? Yes, I guess I'm more sensitive to it. It moves me in a different way when I hear it. And it's also about bringing someone who's dead back to life. Are you nervous? - Yes, I am. Because we're recounting family history. I'm more involved than with a text by some other author. It does affect me personally. So if people don't like it or don't like him, they also don't like this part of our family history, unfortunately. The GDR is a country that emerged crawling from the bloodied womb of German history. AN EVENING FOR THOMAS BRASCH This country clearly bears the scars of German history. And the country I'm now living in, the other part of the German afterbirth, also bears the scars. There was an interview in Stern magazine. Thomas insisted I take part as well. He was like m y agent, and made sure I was noticed and got some work, which I did. So it made sense? Yes, totally. Thomas was incredibly smart and always on the go. It felt like everything had been waiting for him. He also made sure that he controlled how, after Biermann, his departure would be judged. He did of course realize that he, as the son of a high-ranking Party official, and as a former jailbird, because of the Czechoslovakia thing, people in the West would be keen to prove what a terribly unjust country the GDR was. He knew all that. Engels once said, "GERMANY, A WINTER FAIRY TALE", 1972 "For now, the only advice you can give to German poets is to emigrate to more civilized countries." Klaus was the joker in the family. He was funny and always made fun of everyone. Primarily m y father, even in his presence. He was like a clown. He could walk on his hands. That was Klaus. He also was Thomas' and Peter's favorite brother. Really? Yours too? Yes, mine too. Peter was too close to me. I shared a room with him, and we argued and beat each other up. Thomas was too far removed. Klaus was the one who just came over and was funny. He was sometimes drunk. He then got drunk more often and used to argue with m y father. And he was the brilliant actor. I've been wanting to tell you, I wouldn't have joined the Army without conscription. You're not the only one. "YOUR OWN SKIN", 1974 Everyone should decide for themselves, on a voluntary basis. Isn't that a big decision for an 18-year-old brain? Possibly. He joined the Army in 1968, 1969... He was a construction soldier. And then he studied acting. Your father wouldn't have wanted a construction soldier. No. He also repeatedly refused orders which got him a criminal record. He was sentenced in '69. Horst Brasch can't have been pleased. Not at all. All of them had brushes with authority. Peter was already known to the Stasi at the age of 14. The Stasi had a file on him, with ludicrous entries. But you were all right? Yes, totally all right. I was well-behaved. Was that deliberate? Yes, I wanted to be well-behaved. Quite selfishly, I wanted to be left alone. And I think I instinctively knew that I'd only be left alone if I functioned. I do remember seeing Klaus, who I really liked in his own way, just like all the others who I dearly miss today... I remember seeing Klaus in his apartment. We talked about one of his latest films. Come on, stop messing me about. Sunny, I'm shot, I need someone. The phone rang, it was Peter. He told my father that Klaus had died. My father's reaction was, "I still have to fly to Japan." It was the next day. He flew to Japan the following day. I'm not sure what I did. Did I stay with Peter? I can't remember what I did. I was doing an apprenticeship. I went and did my final apprenticeship exam, I was almost in a trance. As the story goes, he was shooting a film at the time, a mining film called "Black Gold." He had a major part in it. They were shooting a pit fire. That's the story I was told. Somehow he got injured during the shoot, he got burned. Not seriously, but enough to really hurt. Then he got drunk. They all went out drinking after the shoot. He got really drunk, but as he was in pain he also took painkillers. And this cocktail killed him. Thomas came over from the West for the funeral. Stasi everywhere. My father and Thomas shook hands somehow. It was all very strange. I said I had to leave to go to college. My father wanted us to do something together. I said I was off to college, but instead went to Heiner. And there we got drunk. 1981: "ANGELS OF IRON" THOMAS BRASCH'S DEBUT FILM IS SELECTED FOR COMPETITION AT THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL. It was so successful, they kept putting on late-night screenings. And, for some strange reason, the bikers who always rode up and down the Avus, attended the late screening at 10 o'clock. There were 150 motorbikes parked on Kurfürstendamm. Thomas and I used to sit in the Café Möhring, drinking beer, and toasting the cinemagoers. It was a cult classic for them. Hands up! They turned up... "they" because Kathi was always with him. Kathi was very young. She was incredible, beautiful. Beautiful, very young, and he... Everyone fell instantly in love with Thomas, men and women. He was amazing. He would sit down, look at you and talk... Great voice, amazing voice. He had it all and he seduced everyone, including me. JOACHIM VON VIETINGHOFF FILM PRODUCER Thomas never won any German awards. For a European film to be selected for competition at Cannes is like winning an Oscar. Although "Angels of Iron" won the Bavarian Film Award. This award goes to the debut film by an established author and will hopefully encourage him and other writers, to engage with this medium which is new to them. I would like to thank the GDR Film School for my training... I would like to thank the GDR Film School for my training. I was standing somewhere with a glass of champagne, watching a monitor, listening to his speech. And then I went... Snorting with laughter I said, "You've really gone insane, man." Naughty, brave, cheeky, and not entirely true as he only did one year at Film School, so he can't have learnt much. But to suddenly praise Babelsberg like this in Munich, was quite an audacity. Did it occur to him to thank me? No. Never. - Why? So he thanked the GDR Film School who threw him out, but not you? It was always a demanding relationship. He always tested how far he could go. It sounds harsh, but it's true. What I found particularly sad was that the East-West antagonism came between us most. Because I was longing for this closeness that the Easterners had among them. Because I know them all, Hilmar Thate, Kathi... all of them. We meet again. Some are waiting, some are celebrating. Gladow! There were also occasions when my father showed signs, although he made no effort, of appreciating it somehow. He said he didn't understand what Thomas was doing, but if everyone talked about it and he was winning awards for his films, then they must be of some value. He himself just didn't get it. So you could definitely say he was proud of his son. "I had a call from the producer of the radio station who had interviewed me. 'We need music editors. You know about music, don't you?' 'Kind of.' 'Don't worry,' said the producer. 'We're about to broadcast round the clock and will take anyone.'" Or when he retired. He took a small two-room apartment in Lichtenberg, backing onto a Kaufhalle car park. He felt that was all he was entitled to. I'm sure he could have had something better. He could have demanded his little house in leafy surroundings like the others did. But he always condemned those who did it. He thought it wasn't right. I'd just heard some wild stories. And eventually, the director Arie Zinger said, ACTRESS "Ivanov is a character like Brasch. All women fall for him." Oh God. I thought to myself I'll better check what he looks like. So I looked at the back cover of his "Beautiful 27th September" and thought, "Not me." Really? - Yes, really. Eventually, I got to sit next to him, and it felt like... It wasn't anything erotic. I felt comfortable. I thought I'd like to have him as a friend. Then there was this party. I was in the kitchen, making a sandwich. Thomas came in and said he was hungry. I offered him my sandwich, but he declined. As I was leaving the room, he grabbed my arm and said, "Stay here!" It really was... an explosion. So that's how it started, our six-year-long relationship. What brought us together was our love of language... and what you could call our traumas. Traumas we had suffered in our past. We'd both suffered from those terrible C-words. Communism, Catholicism, Cadet Corps, Convent Boarding School... We felt this affinity for each other, something you cannot learn. "He used his British passport to cross over at Checkpoint Charlie. I knew he was coming by car. But when he turned up in his green Jaguar and his Kojak sunglasses, I almost didn't recognize him. Next to him sat the Swiss actress he'd been with for a while now. She was as pretty as all of his women, and as different as all of them. I liked her. We went to my father's. My brother was nervous. 'How is he? Do you think he'll listen to me?' 'I don't know. I think he's excited.'" It was quite touching. My father had bought cake and made some coffee. He really wanted it to be all right. But it wasn't all right. Because obviously Thomas asked him questions. He asked him to explain his reasons. Why had he sent him to the Cadet Corps? Why hadn't he brought him back when he couldn't cope? Why had he left him there? But m y father didn't reply to him. All he said was, "I don't have to justify myself to you." And that was the end of the conversation. "'He's such an idiot,' my brother said with a restrained voice, back in the car. 'Why does he do it?' 'He can't help himself. He can't change the way he is.' 'He doesn't want to.'" The weird thing is we'll always be the children of our parents. And we'll always want them to love us. Even this Brasch. I also think the fact that he never really wrote about it, shows that he never quite managed to cope with it. He never wrote about prison, he never wrote about the Cadet Corps, and he never wrote about his parents. I think that's a pretty obvious sign. "In the hours before leaving for boarding school, I placed a glass dome around my heart and heard m y mother and brother talk about love as if through a wall. I didn't want them to get through to me as they would have destroyed me. I didn't want their love because I knew it would soon be taken from me again. I protected myself from your love in the same way. The fear of you withdrawing it from me again one day made me spineless and destructive. I sought revenge from the first woman I ever loved in a way that I'd always waited for and that I can't comprehend even now, avenge myself for this old wound. I sought to inoculate myself against the potential loss, when she or I had to go to the train station. I brought about what I was afraid of." Yes... Is that the end? - No. You mean the letter? - Yes. No, there's several more pages. Peter wanted to go to the West. Someone, I think it was Honecker himself, asked my father if they should let him leave. 1976: PETER BRASCH IS REMOVED FROM STUDYING GERMAN LITERATURE FOR PROTESTING AGAINST BIERMANN'S EXPATRIATION. But m y father said no. I guess he could have meant, "No, not again." Or it could have been based on his thinking that Peter couldn't even cope in the East. He had planned to make a living from writing, but that proved impossible. He was doing radio plays, directing radio plays, writing radio plays and doing children's recordings. That was his thing. The records are still being played today, probably by the grandchildren of the children who listened to them at the time. Thomas also did things for children. But Peter was ahead of him in this respect. He also worked with children a lot, he understood them. He spoke their language. THE IMPROVED RAT I told you once before, I will not have you insult my tail! It's the most beautiful tail in the world! It's naked, and it's ugly. The longer I look at it, the uglier it gets. This is Peter. Or would you say it's Thomas? To me it's Peter. In some of them, it's meant to be obvious. I just wanted them to meet, in art, if not in life. It wasn't always straightforward in real life. Let's start with the top row. You don't want to... And then we'll move these up. They were two people who stood for something. PAINTER, PETER BRASCH'S PARTNER You can't just ignore that. What did they stand for? For art, theater, literature, for love, life, politics, for the GDR, for the West... It's all in there. And actually also for being Jewish. Although they never really practiced it. But they always had a presence about them. They entered a room and had an instant presence. In the book you published, you talk a lot about visiting places from his past. Yes, the places from his childhood. During that time, he thought about where his parents were from, his grandmother in Potsdam, or childhood friends of his parents. We did go there, but there wasn't that much new information there. He sought new information on his childhood? Yes, he did. He was trying to. But he didn't really use this information. Unlike Marion in her novel. - Exactly. That's the next level. I think he might also have been a bit scared to really write about the family history, because Thomas never allowed it. He thought it was wrong. Except for oblique references in poems and so on. And Peter did try and emulate him, whether deliberately or not. No, Thomas didn't like it. Peter absolutely loved this picture, of course. How did he always put it? "It's fairly easy, being overshadowed by your brother." But I didn't find it at all easy to live with it. 1987: THOMAS BRASCH STARTS WORK ON HIS FILM "THE PASSENGER", INSPIRED BY THE STORY OF THE NAZI PROPAGANDA FILM "JUD SÜSS." Kathi and I went to the Grips Theater to check out and meet some actors there. But Thomas didn't show up. When we came out after the show, we saw Thomas slumped in the street, seated there like a puppet whose strings have been cut, right next to the stage door. He was completely drunk, slurring his speech. As soon as we came out, he started insulting us in a ridiculous way, the details don't matter. But it was obvious that this man wasn't himself anymore. It happened more and more frequently. When we met up after this episode, I told him, "Thomas, I can only do this film if you get dry. I can't embark on this huge project with you." I was 100% decided. But somehow he managed to convince me. And once you sign the final documents, there's no way back. I think it was an extremely hard time for VIETINGHOFF and the others, because Thomas kept changing his dramatic concept and then the financial situation exploded. Thankfully, I was kept out of this at the time. I told him, "Thomas, I got us two million more than we had planned. Now we've gone over by 700,000. You and I need to save this amount somehow." It's still possible four weeks before shooting. Thomas got up. "Money's not my problem." And left the room. I thought if I abandoned it now, I'd have debts of 1.8 million and no film. As a good businessman, what did I do? I did the film, threatened by a prison sentence, I was 700,000 in debt, but I had a film. They dragged me along on two or three films. I was made a gaffer. Because Thomas said he wanted you to work on this film? That's right. And you kept on working as a gaffer? For a while. You also mentioned that you went to uni. What did you study? German Literature, Politics and Philosophy. Do you feel a member of the Brasch family? No. I don't feel a member of the family. I feel quite close to Marion and Thomas, but I don't consider myself a Brasch. I saw him as my procreator, or more like a friend. The role of "dad" had already been taken. We had already separated and were with different partners. Thomas was with Ursula, and I was with Markus Völlenklee. The sexual element had been suspended. Temporarily. This was at the airport, waiting for Tony Curtis. Both women are there, Ursula and Kathi. You can tell how nervous he is. We were allowed onto the runway, bypassing security. Why was this allowed? You can do anything if you really want to. Tony Curtis was coming to Berlin. Considering the time it was made, it seems incredible for such a big star to do a German film in Germany, about this subject. It's about an American director coming to Germany, to shoot a film about what happened to him in Germany 47 years ago. It wasn't until we'd come to the West, that he became interested in addressing Jewish issues. And on such a complex level as he does in "The Passenger". Where Jews aren't just victims, but also perpetrators. That was highly controversial. It's not our fault you're a Jew and had to be in a concentration camp. Don't you think we suffered, too? You could have fled once you got out of the camp. Why don't you shoot your film in America and leave us in peace? To this day, when people talk about which German films were selected for competition at Cannes, Thomas Brasch is never mentioned. And he had two films competing there. If someone tells me they saw this film, I say, "So you were one of 9,000 people who went to see the film in the whole of Germany?" 9,000 people. Thomas was already an enfant terrible then. He was no longer someone... someone you'd crave to be associated with. You knew it would be challenging. Fascism happened as long ago as a second of my lifetime, compared to the history of mankind. That's how long ago it happened, just one second. In relation to the history of mankind, it wasn't even as long ago as our interview has lasted. But if the Germans think that this one second is so far in the past, they don't have to think about it anymore, I feel sorry for them. The Americans still think about their revolution. Soviet films still deal with what happened during the Stalin era. And that goes back further. The present is nothing other than the result of the past. AUGUST 1989: HUNDREDS OF GDR CITIZENS SEEK REFUGE IN WEST GERMAN EMBASSIES IN PRAGUE, EAST BERLIN AND BUDAPEST TO FORCE THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE WEST. Sadly, the next time I met the members of the Brasch family, or, rather, the remaining members, was to see Horst in 1989. He was already seriously ill in hospital. And of course he'd kind of heard about the changes that were happening around him, specifically the political changes. And I remember quite vividly that we had a heated argument. Many of the socio-political developments happening at the time were something he was opposed to. The political direction Gorbachev had taken since 1986, and which helped to bring about glasnost and perestroika, he criticized vehemently, even in his poor state of health. I think he even used the term "treason." I was visiting m y father and talked to the senior physician. He told me that he probably wouldn't survive the night. He was already heavily sedated on morphine. So I went in to see him... I held his hand and for some reason suddenly launched into a monologue, a religious monologue. Then I left. And a few hours later, the next morning, I got the phone call saying he'd passed away. AUGUST 29, 1989: HORST BRASCH'S FUNERAL TAKES PLACE AT THE SOCIALIST MEMORIAL. THE GDR PARTY LEADERSHIP IS THERE, ERICH HONECKER IS IN HOSPITAL. Amongst the mourners, alongside the family, were SED politburo members Hermann Axen, Horst Dohlus and Heinz Keßler, companions of the deceased from his early FDJ days, as well as the Minister of National Education, Margot Honecker. "THE BRASCH BROTHERS", REHEARSAL "Dear Father, it hasn't been easy to love what I wanted to love, but had to, the GDR, the dream of Socialism and my father. My dear, I really love you, even though this may make you cringe. I may be the last one whose love you seek, but I don't care. You left Nazi Germany which was hard, but the right thing to do. I left the GDR which was harder, for I had to leave m y heart behind. I don't hope the GDR will break as you hoped Hitler would break. I want the GDR to be what Marx wished for from Germany." And then he writes a new letter. "It's now six in the morning, and my thoughts are probably confused..." He wrote several different versions. Did he post them? No, he didn't post them. OCTOBER 18, 1989: ERICH HONECKER IS FORCED TO ABDICATE. ONLY THREE WEEKS LATER, ON NOVEMBER 9, 1989, THE INNER-GERMAN BORDER IS OPENED. "My country had only recently held an election. The majority voted for the fat man and the Deutschmark. Matthew wanted to know my opinion in great detail. I said I was worried the loss of the country could also mean a loss of opportunity to turn it into something better. 'You're opposed to this reunification everyone's talking about?' 'Yes.' 'But why?' 'They could have tried something different with this country.'" This generation, the ones returning from concentration camps, from captivity, from being in exile, they were tortured souls. This may be a unifying thought, they achieved a lot in a short space of time. They built this country. And they did it in a better way, in the beginning. Maybe they just ran out of energy. That's how this idea got neglected. Of course the Cold War also played a part in this, as well as their justified fear of losing what they'd built in such a short time. That's why they built the Wall. I can understand those who are defending what they thought was right and tried to make work, in the generation preceding ours. It would be absurd to ridicule the Party or the Communists who established this country. This would also ridicule the debate. But it was, and will continue to be, different, a huge conflict, creating a lot of friction, and some great literature. He did two house moves with me, SCULPTOR when there weren't many other people helping him because, at those times, there were a lot of people he'd been close to and he'd now fallen out with. And Thomas also wasn't doing well financially. However, he refused to accept this as his true life situation. And if you look at his flat on Schiffbauerdamm, you'll find a very accurate illustration of this. It was a huge and very grandiose flat. He told me, "Listen, this is probably m y last house move. The one after this one will be to a very small space." Thomas became speechless, he actually lost his ability to write and became completely withdrawn. And as for Peter, he never really coped that well and was somehow mourning the death of the GDR, even though he's had such a hard time. In the end, it was a form of disintegration. Falling into some kind of sadness, not knowing what to aim for. What could be a new direction? I think this was what was lacking. They persistently stuck to the lives they had, the lives they knew. I can see everything, Peter. - I know. Let us go and tell him we want to get engaged. Could I please ask you for your girlfriend's leg in marriage? No, it's all or nothing. All of it? What kind of ass do you think I have? There's nothing there. We were expecting a baby again back then. But the pregnancy was terminated prematurely, we couldn't make full term. But he'd already written a diary for the child. We had a tree for Christmas, even though the child wasn't born yet. It was very tragic. But that's how it was. Maybe the child didn't want to arrive. It was New Year's Eve 2000/2001. He'd been dry for seven years. And all of a sudden, he said, "I fancy a glass of red wine." "But you don't drink?" "Yeah, but I can have a glass of red wine." I was concerned about him, I knew something was wrong. He was drinking again. It happened quickly, I found him dead in his flat. You found him? Well... I'd noticed that he was drinking again, but there was nothing I could do. I'd handed back the key to his flat because we'd been arguing. So I couldn't just walk in. Luckily, the owner was there. He'd eventually arrived. He went in first, and then he said, "You'd better not come in here." They found him on the door mat there. He had a total breakdown, a lot of vodka. He made it back up to his flat, and that was it. It wasn't pretty. No, not pretty at all. At Peter's funeral, SOCIOLOGIST, COUSIN I witnessed Thomas... who was deeply saddened about his youngest brother dying before he did. He didn't want to draw on the political change in Germany. ACTRESS, DIRECTOR And then, in one way or another, he got back to his old alter ego, Brunke. 1992-1999: THOMAS BRASCH IS WORKING ON HIS NOVEL "BRUNKE THE GIRL-KILLER." Brunke basically represents the inexplicable state of the world following the fall of the Wall. A great many inconceivable things were happening. Socialism was meant to be this wheel that would keep on turning, like we were taught, it would bring progress. Capitalism would vanish, Socialism would arrive, and eventually paradise. But this wasn't what happened. And people weren't exactly being very nice either, neither in the East, nor in the West. The utopia wasn't necessarily pretty. And it wasn't really wild. All the things Thomas liked were missing. And I think Brunke could have represented that. "B. the Girl-Killer, from B. What is to become of Central Europe when I won't be there anymore one day?" It was this mammoth project. SCULPTOR The expectations of the outside world after his long silence... We have the manuscripts he kept sending to the Suhrkamp publishing house. Someone should sift through it, then we'd know whether it would be three, four or ten volumes. But in this format... This is the scope we're talking about. And he clearly deliberately wanted it to be the kind of edition which has this aura of being indigestible. His attempts of showing me excerpts in the hope I might be able to give him some advice, which isn't really possible, of course... I think they were born out of desperation. He wasn't happy with the text, somehow tried to get to grips with it, but it was all slipping away from him. This is "Brunke the Girl-Killer" in the format it was published during Thomas' lifetime. One thing he managed to get past his editor was this pin-up dust jacket, the little picture there. We saw each other for a few years, but that stopped when he started becoming frail. Why was that? I guess he just wasn't interested anymore. We didn't see each other for a year, and then we arranged to meet, but he only talked to some other theater people the whole time. Was that when he was living on Schiffbauerdamm? You mentioned he was becoming frail. Did you notice it? We were still doing coke in the garden right after his surgery. Really? - Sure. There wasn't a day that went by without him listening to this with great fervor. The apartment on Schiffbauerdamm is basically a rented stage in a corner position. There is this large corner room, with one set of windows facing the Spree river and another facing Brechtplatz. If you opened all the windows... He also had a powerful stereo. So if he turned it all the way up, he was blasting out his music at a place so critical of Berlin. There's the Tränenpalast opposite, the flowing water of the Spree which was very important to him, the view of the river and the movement of the water, the train station... It had a certain magic quality, for him and probably anyone else who was receptive to it. For you too? Yes, of course. You can tell by me listening to this music, reminiscing, it's all coming back. Him, in this huge room, sitting on a bench, unsettled. With this music. It wasn't... a huge surprise when he died. DOROTHEENSTADT CEMETERY BERLIN When all the roses fade When the summer leaves the land And the daisies turn to grey And the daisies turn to grey Of course, back then I was thinking, they're all dying around me. What am I going to do? But it wasn't until later, after everything had happened, that I realized there are only two Braschs left. "The next day was the weekend and Matthew was off work. We crossed the river, ambled through pretty parks and depleted streets. At Coney Island, we rode on the only Ferris wheel still operating between the rusty dreams and boarded-up illusions. Four days later, Matthew took me to the airport. 'It's been nice with you,' I said. 'And with you,' he replied. We knew we didn't have to say any more. We had fallen in love with our words, with our absence, with hope written down on paper. No more. It was over." FOR ELISA NAAMA, STELLA, ANNA, LENA AND BENJAMIN Wasn't there a jingle after this?
