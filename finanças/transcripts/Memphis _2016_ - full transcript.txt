Memphis. It s a rough place where the slow economic rebound still hasn't happened, and it's a sure bet for the top 5 list of most dangerous cities in the States. These four people have adapted a complex relationship with money just to survive there. I wouldn't have stopped using heroin if I hadn't been arrested, at all. I would have kept going until I died. When I left prison, I didn't have money, but I had my time back, so I was rich. Working full time and busting my butt as a police officer, and busting my butt in training, you know, all that stuff's gonna pay off eventually in the future. Ah, nice! 24-5 in one day. One day. Not two days, one day. One city, four people, and where they live is a key part of who they are. * I found a place to sell my name * * Along the markets promenade * High prices * Going down * Oh the rice is burning brown * And high prices going down * It's home base for FedEx and Oscar-winning rap group Three 6 Mafia. But despite its musical rap, Memphis struggles with crime and poverty more than most cities in the South. The biggest building downtown isn't a Wal-Mart, it's a jail, overseeing 2,600 inmates. But Memphis is also the second most affordable city in the US. Housing costs are 20% below the national average, making it an easy place for millenials to gain a financial edge. Tito Porter is one of them. He rents his large four bedroom split level house in the suburbs. My name's Tito Porter. I'm 29. I have five kids. My oldest is 8, and my youngest is 7 weeks. We live in a house in Memphis, Tennessee. Good ol' small country town. My three jobs are car salesman, tax preparation, and a barber. I'm fixing up a car I already sold, and the client is just waiting on me to deliver. So I gotta get it out before they get too anxious and buy another car from somebody else. So if I can't get this car finished in time, then I lose about 3,400. I try to make 2,500 a week at least, you know. My bills, you know, they equal three or four grand per month, so I like to have a surplus. If you don't have a surplus, you can't invest, you can't make more money. If you just make it, that's what you'll do for the rest of your life, just make it. * I grew up in South Memphis. It's probably the bottom as far as poverty, housing conditions, the schools available, the neighbourhoods, you know. It's pretty run down. And it's kind of hard, just to be frank. It's a hard neighbourhood to grow up in. It's like one of the worst. A lot of businesses, they don't open in South Memphis. Tito was looking at a jail sentence of up to 196 years for a string of crimes, mostly theft. Consecutive sentencing meant he could serve time for every conviction. I was arrested for aggravated robbery, and also crimes that I didn't commit. And upon each conviction, the sentencing guideline rises, and I had like 12, so 196 years was within scope. When they tell you, it's mind-blowing. You don't know whether to cry, you don't know whether to commit suicide, it's just... it's just hard to grasp. It seems like a dream. The judge allowed Tito to serve his 12 sentences at the same time, and he got out after 4 years for good behaviour. When I left prison, I didn't have money, but time is money. And I had my time back, so I was rich. * Hey world, what's poppin' * I go by the name of Blac Youngsta * Blac Youngsta is from South Memphis, one of the poorest areas in America, with an average income in the bottom 10%. Rapping got him out of there, and he doesn't wanna move back. I rap about the struggle, the pain. Like the shit I talk about, real life. I don't worry about no Hollywood shit 'cause I ain't Hollywood. * I've been in the industry probably like six months, since I been signed to CMG, Collective Music Group, Cocaine Muzik Group, whatever you want to call it. * 24-5, one day. One day. Not two days, one day. We just got started. I ain't even through with the week yet. When I'm through with the week, I'm probably like 100,000 or something. Wanna see me make some money? I'm gonna show you how to make some money. I'll show you. - Payday. - Payday. What's up, bro? What's up? It's the king himself, man. Yeah, what's up? Yo Gotti is the CEO of CMG, and my relation to him, I'm his artist. I look at him like a big brother, he's my mentor. Rap mogul and Memphis native Yo Gotti discovered Blac Youngsta rapping in the streets of his hometown. I was shooting a video in the hood and he was out there on the corner rapping, dancing, doing these things with no beat, just a cappella. And then like the kids and everybody walking by, people around, they was rapping the song with him. So I noticed that like whatever this is he's rapping, they knew it. And one thing led to another, you know. I just told him like if you with it, man, we can go try to get some money together. This the new rim? These the new rims you put on them? They're Forges. With Yo Gotti's help, he produced a mixtape and started playing shows. The money poured in. His fan base grew to over 300,000 followers. Yo Gotti bought me a Lamborghini. You know, he bought it because I made him a lot of money, we made a lot of money together. I'm pushing hard. What we gonna do about the tape? Youngsta wants to keep his fans happy and make money. The only way to do that is to make more music. I'm working on a mixtape right now, it's called Young & Reckless. This is my second once since I've been signed to CMG, so it mean a lot to me to just see my fans and see how they gonna react to the music. I love people's opinion. Right now, my career, honest to God truth, I haven't got started yet. We just really playing around. I ain't even got a record. I ain't got a single, I ain't got shit. I'm just playing around, getting money. Blac Youngsta has fought to get where he is. hat's the story other people n Memphis can relate to. Ah, I messed it up. That's okay, that's alright. I grew up in Memphis. I dropped out of school and I was doing drugs, snorting cocaine. I was on a horrible, horrible path. Martial arts definitely saved my life. Good! There you go! Right on that cheek. Good, good good good. My name is AmberLynn Orr, and I'm 23 years old. I work full time as a police officer, and I work pretty much full time as an MMA fighter. I've been a police officer for about 3 years. The typical day for me is 12 hour shifts, which is pretty long. I make 18.55 an hour, which is... you know, it's not bad, but you know, having a house, and of course bills, and fighting full time and training, it gets kind of strenuous. I definitely think police officers are underpaid, and it is a selfless job, and it's a thankless job. Driver, pull over to your right. Driver, pull your vehicle over to the right. I'm seeing the worst of people. I'm seeing people when they're angry, I'm seeing people when they're mad. A lot of people don't like police officers. I'll be on 301 just north of just north of Nell Road. There's a lot of media scrutiny, and I don't think cops are respected anywhere. You know, every time you turn on the news, it's an officer shooting, or officer did this, or officer did that. So there's nothing, anything positive. And it just makes this job so much tougher. What can I help y'all do? What can I help y'all with? 14 Information, the fire's picking up pretty fast. At the end of the day, it's hard to just take this uniform off and let it be over with. But it's something you learn to cope with and start fresh the next day. * Memphis, other side of the tracks is where you can walk from the have to the have-nots. You can walk from 3-storey buildings to a duplex that is boarded up one side and open on the other. Teenage heroin use in Memphis is double the national average. 20-year-old Nathan Wilson just got out of jail for heroin possession. He's trying to get his money straight the first time in his life. I'm from Memphis, Tennessee. I lived in the Highland Heights part, but I hung out in Nutbush a lot. Nutbush is a notorious white ghetto. At least half the people in the penal farm, in the legal system that are white, come from Nutbush. And it's... scrub life, is what we call it. Nathan met his friends in a rehab program called Drug Court. Energy Drink Day. Sounds like a great idea on paper, great idea. How many did you have? At least six. That's too much. I'm in a program called Drug Court, where I have to take up to 21 piss tests a week. We sign a waiver that says it's a six month program at the halfway house, but it's really after 90 days. Then we're eligible to move out, and that will be coming up in about a week. I have to have everything in order at the old house, as far as rent. I have to be a certain amount into my 12-step program until I'm eligible to move out. Nathan, Garret and Flynn all want to make money, but random drug tests, court dates, and AA meetings make it hard to keep a job. A criminal record is one thing, but a criminal record with all the stipulations and all the time constraints that you've got in this program, getting a job, paying rent on a house of your own, it's just-- it's not gonna happen. We are in Lafayette Circle. This is a house that I'm hopefully gonna be moving in, if the courts deem that I'm ready. Where's the flame come out of? There ain't no flames, it's electric. It's electric. So if a power outage came, we screwed. Cold, cold raviolis. Cold raviolis. This'll be the first house that I could say is my own, so it's a major accomplishment. So you've got space underneath your bed. This bed looks really comfortable, but it's not. I'm so proud of you. Nathan and his friends realize that with their low paying jobs, they'll cover rent with just a few extra bucks to spare. At minimum wage, 40 hours a week, after taxes it would come out to about 280 bucks. You got $110 a week for your rent, that's down to 170. Then you got court costs, which is $100 a month, 25 off that, so 145, let's say. $5 a day for a pack of cigarettes, 35 out of that. So you got about 100 bucks to eat, do anything you want to do, and transportation, 'cause we have to be here, we have to be there. But on the flip side of that... I had a drug habit, which was way more than $20 a day. So like when you're sober, you're not necessarily willing to do the things that you were willing to do to get high to get an Egg McMuffin, you know. I'm not gonna rob Flynn's grandma for an Egg McMuffin. I'm just not gonna do it. There are 170 documented gangs in Memphis. 80% of the crimes committed in Tennessee are drug related. There's one cop for every 300 people in Memphis, 5th highest police-to-citizen ratio in the States. AmberLynn is a cop, but what she really wants to do is be an MMA champion. With 9 out of 10 wins in her amateur career, she's got a good chance. I'm training for my upcoming fight. It's gonna be my professional debut. Starting off, you know, the pay is definitely not that great, but just getting the exposure of being with Invicta and having a professional debut in Las Vegas is huge. Amberlynn knows that she can make 30,000 a year as a cop, but her dream is to make 60,000 a night in the cage. Let's go! Training is definitely gruelling and painful. You know, your body, it just gets broken down over time. You know, there's plenty of nights in here where I sit on the floor after practice for 5 or 10 minutes 'cause I literally cannot get up. Since I've become an MMA fighter, I've had my nose broken, I've had lower back injuries. I definitely need surgery on both my knees, but I don't have the money to pay for that. There you go. 'Cause I pulled a bit more. Oh, okay. I wish I could train full time, but that's... the biggest thing is the financial pressure. I'm not able to do that, which in turn I think my skills lack as a professional fighter. Good, yes! A lot of these other girls, they don't have full-time jobs. That's all they have to do. How they do it, I'm not sure. But right now, I'm just looking to get my name out there where I can make enough money and dedicate 100% of my time to MMA and training. Blac Youngsta's going to see his grandmother in the house where he was raised. I had to take care of my little brothers and shit, like I had to be a man at the early age. I had to, 'cause I was a hustler and I was selling dope. My grandma used to go to sleep late at night and shit. It'd be 2:00, 3:00 in the morning. I used to crack her window open, and I used to be serving motherfuckers out the window. And I want my kids to have a different future. And I know I can change it, you feel what I'm saying? Hey, man! Yeah, man, CMG! CMG shit, man! Young rich niggas ahead of the shit, man! CMG shit, know what I'm talking about? Yeah, man! For real, Jack! Hey, man! You see that? They love me, man. My city love me, man. Gotta keep that heat. Grandma house right here. People are allowed to open-carry weapons in Memphis, and in this South Memphis neighbourhood, you have a 1 in 15 chance of becoming a victim of violent crime. Because of that, Youngsta brings his crew to protect him and his money. Watch everything. Anything come through looks suspicious, we bust 'em. Ain't no talking or nothing. Hey now. How y'all doing? Hey, Grandma. Anything look suspicious, shoot it. Don't hesitate, shoot. We at the queen house, Queen Louise. Queen of McMillan house. Queen of McKillin'. I'm gonna get you a queen bed. You slept in a twin bed all your life. New bed, new house, new everything. I want that big-ass bed now, I'll tell you what. lmost a third of the people in Memphis live below the poverty line, including Blac Youngsta's grandmother. But not anymore. He just bought her she raised him in. I love the neighbourhood. I know everybody in the neighbourhood, and everybody know me. Now I won't have to move. Won't have nobody to tell me nothing to do no more. I got something belongs to me and I'm proud of it. One bedroom, one bathroom, and one living room. It was me, my three little brothers, and my grandma and my granddaddy. My Aunt Janice, she got like seven kids. So like half of the time they was in here with us. So we were like 15 deep in this motherfucker. We used to sit here, and we used to have prayer. Like our prayer was like, "Thank you Lord for this food, I hope I get some more." I've been eating leftovers all my life. That's why I don't eat leftovers no more, to this day. I want a fresh plate. No leftovers, no warm up, none of that. * * Grew up in a one bedroom house * * I swear to God * I ain't had no bed, had to sleep on the couch * Youngsta's manager, Brandon, shows up with an advance of 10,000, all in cash, for an upcoming gig. That's cheesy. Yeah, man. Oof. Tennessee has the top self-employed workforce in the South, with over 36,000 people in Memphis running their own businesses. Tito juggles three of them. D&P Taxes is a tax preparation company. We deal with small tax, personal tax, and business taxes as well. We opened about 12 days ago, and business has been phenomenal. We didn't even expect it. And so far, we've made $35,000. From this batch today, 15 clients. That'll be at least 6,000 or 7,000 today. TP! My name is Shameka Porter, and I'm his wife. I'm an income tax preparer. I'm comfortable with both us working. It's a hassle sometimes, it's kind of hard, but we can get the job done. We're a team. In an area where 96,000 people use no financial institutions, Memphis contains more tax preparation and loan shops than bank branches. Tito's tax business offers quick returns for people who are likely to get refunds. Some of them will take that cheque and buy a used car. Hello? It depends on what's your price range. I got a few vehicles right now, and I'll check the inventory, I'll see what we got, and I can... I can give you a call back tomorrow. I saw a common link that I could use to my advantage, and it's cars and taxes. I got a reputation for having good vehicles. When I got into the tax thing, it was like they both coincide. So they can come in walking and they can leave away driving. You know, it's a win-win situation. They win, and I win. s, with an incarceration rate double that of the national average. any time, there could be er 4,500 people behind bars. At one point, Nathan was one of them. I was raised by my mom for most of my life. That's the frosted look, you know. I had grandpa's suit on, you know, was balling. I think I'm gonna marinate the steaks. I'm gonna put them in the foil, and yeah, put 'em straight in there, in the fire. My mom's an alcoholic, my dad was an alcoholic and addict. So they have a saying in recovery that two sickies don't make a welly. Well... you know what I'm saying, here I am. But the grill marks really makes it taste better? It does. You eat with your eyes before you eat with your mouth, Mom. I've heard that before. It's not just a saying, it's facts. You ever had a omelet that had all those different coloured peppers in it? Yeah. Do you think the peppers really taste different? No, it's the mixture of it. When I found out that Nathan had been arrested, I was happy. Because he had consequences, therefore I was hoping this would make a change for him. His mom found him dead on his porch two years earlier. EMS brought him back to life. I wouldn't have stopped using heroin if I hadn't been arrested. Heroin was... was God. I would have kept going until I died, and died some more. Nathan's mom refused to pay his bail bond, so he ended up in jail with a year's sentence. I just think people don't change. If they keep on getting by with anything, they're not gonna... why change? He's got the drive that it doesn't matter what it is, he could do that. * Hungry like the wolf Memphis has always been a big part of southern hip hop. Rappers from Memphis love to rep their city. Most working musicians here earn less than $15,000 a year. Only a very few will ever break six figures, and Youngsta's one of them. He hopes his new mixtape will allow him to command up to $30,000 per show. One more time. Let me hear from the top of my verse. This mixtape right here mean a lot to me 'cause it's turnt. Every song, like boom, boom, boom, like that popping. You know how it is, it's just like that. I'm already hot. I'm already booked up. Me dropping this mixtape is gonna just make it even worse. Put out 14 songs, and if one catch, we got the bag, we gone. Like you make more money when you got a hot single. I asked them if this feels like an intro. You say it is or it ain't? I feel like it ain't, it ain't hard enough. That's 'cause you ain't make it hard. Brandon is my manager. He important to me 'cause he's like... like he go get the money. Brandon knows it's dangerous for Youngsta to carry so much cash. Just weeks before, Youngsta was detained by Atlanta police for carrying 70,000. Youngsta, all he talks about is money. All he shows is money. I mean, he made it that way because he's never had it the way he has it now. These my babies right here. Shit right here mean a whole lot. I spent 12,000 apiece for these. 12,000, 12,000, that's 24,000, just the charm by itself. My watch, this cost 45,000. When you're a young, black African American, you gotta have this. Like we're I'm from in the hood. you hood rich with a hundred. So like... I got way more than a hundred. It's part of a young black man's life. I used to ask him like, "Bro, put the money in the bank. It's getting overwhelming. You can't even put the money in your pocket." He was like, "Man, I've never had any money, so for it to be on me like this and for me to see it, you can't even understand the feeling that I feel. 'Cause me and you, you've been there with this kind of money, so you probably went through this phase too. So let me go through my phase." And I can't do nothing but respect it. Bow-bow-bow-bow-bow brr-bow-bow-bow! While Blac Youngsta has made a vow to never eat leftovers again, AmberLynn has to make her food last for the entire week. I just went to the grocery store today, so I've got like tons of food for the whole week. Fruit, chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, those are nutrients that your body needs to be able to push really hard and keep on going. But the healthy food, it's really expensive. The grocery store trip that we made today was like $130, and this will probably last us hopefully a week and a half. But it's gonna have to last us a week and a half, 'cause I just got paid on Wednesday and I've got like $290 left. That's why we buy in bulk and we... we ration out everything. Woo! Oh, that's a good one. Thomas is my boyfriend. He's my main trainer. I think that one of the pros to having him as my trainer and my boyfriend is that we understand each other. What are you gonna do with the meat? Make some of it and then freeze some of it, with some bell peppers and onion. I think he probably walks around a little bit heavier than I do, but we both fight at the same weight class, which is kind of cool. Cutting weight is one of the most crucial parts. With me walking around about 155 pounds, that gives me 20 pounds to cut to 135, which is definitely a very, very strenuous thing that your body has to go through. And there is definitely a sense of urgency. The quicker I can get to the top, you know, hopefully the quicker I can get out. AmberLynn has gotten clean, which is hard to do in Memphis. In the past decade, Tennessee ranked 2nd for opioid use. About three quarters of these users turn to heroin. Nathan Wilson was among them, and now the Drug Court demands that he checks in 20 times a week to make sure he's clean. If he misses a drug test, he gets a penalty. I've got community service. Picking up trash. I was five minutes late for a drug screen. I was just running late. I tried to find a ride, couldn't, so I ended up walking up there, and I was five minutes late. And the person who takes the screens was already gone. If I'm late for a drug test, when I call my drug screen line in the morning, my name will be there and I'll go to court, and it'll probably... I'll receive probably a 24-hour sanction, which is a 24-hour jail sentence. And if I keep messing up, they'll kick me out of the program and I'll have to do my year's incarceration. So I'm okay for another four hours, then I gotta call again. Having to call in three times a day and having all these obligations, it most definitely can affect my employment. First time something happens and you have to tell your employer, "Yeah, I've gotta do this. I'm on a thing called Drug Court." It's called Drug Court. They're gonna wanna know what the hell you did. And in my case, it's heroin. And nobody wants to hear the word heroin. So yeah, it definitely affects employment. But on the flip side, if you complete this program, it's wiped from your record. So it's a hell of a penance, but if I can do this, I can do anything, man. Nathan's mistakes are costing him time and money. Tito isn't making that mistake again. He's got a buyer for a used Buick, and if he can find the right car, he'll make $2,500 profit. Right now I'm headed to the lot to check out a couple vehicles. Some days it's kind of hectic. Being a dad, it takes a lot of your time. Especially if you have to pick kids up, drop kids off. So that's three hours gone out of the day. My wife just sent me a text message, and it said I do too much. I rip and run, I gotta slow down. But I don't think I will stop. Stopping is like death, or like jail. And jail is the 2nd worst thing. So I can't see myself slowing down. If there's an opportunity where I can make $10 or 10,000... I'm gonna try to make both. Hello? I'm up here right now. It's a whole lot of Buick LeSabres. What's the price range you looking for? All right, thank you. Replace the grill, replace the head lights, and put a new bumper on there and it'll be good to go. It'll be a perfect car, almost. That's how you make money though. It's easy. My wife was there every step of the way. Even when I went to prison, she was waiting on me to come home. And she was just my girlfriend then, so that spoke volumes. I realized that I wasn't just living for myself anymore. You know, I couldn't make selfish decisions. I had to make decisions based on us as a whole. I thought about their quality of life, and it made me change my life. Like I did a 360. Thanks for your help. Thank you for your help. I just give them everything that I... wished I had, you know. So everything that I wished I had, I give it to them. That's what made me who I am today. Blac Youngsta knows that he has to make it outside of Tennessee. Brandon books him a show in Chicago for $10,000. And the last thing, make sure you got that ice. You're on point with your ice and shit. Put that big boy on first. It's important that I'm here in Chicago for me to gain fans. The whole goal is to be a superstar. I wanna be everywhere. I want Grammys, I want everything. I wanna be in the top magazines, all the shit. So like in order for me to get that, it's gonna take for them to ask who you think should be in a magazine? And all my folks gonna be like, Youngsta. But in order for that to happen, I gotta gain my fans outside of Tennessee, everywhere around the world, to be on my side. God sent me here to put on a good show, and that's what I'm gonna do tonight. * I had to go and get somewhere else * * Died right there in front of my eyes * * Laying on the hospital bed and crying * * You said your last words, I thought I died * * Screaming still la la la la la * * I swear to God * I cross my heart * My fingers ain't crossed * Nah nah nah It went great tonight. I wish I would have sold that motherfucker out, you know, but I still feel good about it. I appreciate that love like that. I'm on camera, man! You know what we talking about, we turnt! Yeah! Yeah, they love my music. They love the new shit and they love the old shit. I feel good about the new mixtape for the drop. It's gonna turn out good, it's gonna be great. * To be the richest motherfucker and the greatest motherfucker to ever do this shit. That's my endgame. Next city, next show, next dollar, man. Next cheque, next bag, next 10,000. Blac Youngsta has risen so fast he'll fall hard if the money stops rolling in. * Despite the fact that the murder rate in Memphis is about 4 times the national average, AmberLynn has an optimistic view of the city. I want to bring more awareness to Memphis, and you know, show more people that Memphis is an okay place. I think a lot of people hear Memphis, and they're like, "Oh goodness, I'm not gonna go out there. I'm gonna get shot or something like." But there is places where it is pretty nice, and I would like for other people to know that too. Being a police officer, up to this point, is my only source of income. I need to make money and it's definitely hard on me physically, I'm paying the price for it. Having just turned professional in the rankings of MMA, I have not made a dime off of fighting. You know, I can't quit my job. As much as I would like to train full time, I just can't quit my job. It's Payday for AmberLynn. I just got paid this morning. The money was definitely needed. I was running on $8 for about two or three days, so this couldn't have come at a better time. For this pay period I had 95 hours, and I made $1,172. * Nathan landed a job at a sports bar, and he needs to get $100 a shift to make his part of the rent for the new house. The problem is that at any moment he can be called downtown for drug testing and lose his shift. On a Friday, Saturday night, I expect to make over $100. This is the night I come in and my head, I'm gonna make rent tonight. Working at a bar puts Nathan at risk for drinking. If he gets caught, it's an automatic year in jail. Sometimes it can be a little stressful, especially when people try and buy you shots repeatedly. I tell 'em if you're gonna buy me a shot, you also gotta buy me a lawyer, bond money, hand cuffs, breathalyzer test, and it's just a lot cheaper to get me root beer. * So that's what I made tonight. $51 on a Friday, and that ain't so good. That ain't so good at all. I'm just holding on to hope that I can recoup this Saturday and that it'll all work out. 'Cause if I get down about it, I'll defeat myself before I even begin. But yeah, it's definitely a disappointment. To meet her goal of making $60,000 per cage fight, AmberLynn has to transform her body, and that's not cheap. This is $35. This is $70, which definitely can't afford that right now, so we're gonna go with the smaller one. I have to be 135 pounds for my fight. If I don't make 135, then the way that I look at it is they're not gonna want me back and I'm never gonna have a career. $55. Guess I'll pass on that. Man, all this is complicated. It's like being in a pharmacy. At this point, we only have two confirmed sponsors. If those two offer $200 apiece, the rest of the money comes out of my own pocket. $35.12. I think the other one was 35 too, so 60, 70, 80... - $90. - Wow. AmberLynn's mom Carla manages her fight schedule and promotions. Now that she's pro, she definitely needs a manager. A manager takes 10%. Then you've got trainers, you have to pay 10% too. So with me being her manager, she doesn't have to pay me right now. The expenses are a lot. We have the medicals, which is from about $700 to $900, all the money for food, for protein, for supplements, everything gets really expensive in preparation for my fight. Think I'm gonna get this one, let's see where we're at. Alright. So 133.60. Okay, so here's 60, and then I'm gonna put the rest on my card. Okay. Thank goodness Thomas gave me 60 bucks. With his 60, I put $73 on my card, and I only had $93 on my card. So that leaves me with $20 for the next two days until I get paid again. In Memphis, about half the people who go to jail end up back there within three years, and about 85% of those people have been convicted of drug related crimes and have to check in at Drug Court once a week. What about it, man? We straight? Alright. How's it going? It's going. Nathan thinks he might get out of this system this week. Drug Court Judge Tim Dwyer knows otherwise. As a general rule, we like for them to stay in the halfway house about six months. Our main emphasis, of course, is to try to keep them in a drug-free environment. The house is getting a little toxic, man. Well, we'll stay in touch with him about it. He keeps us posted, he's good about it. You've gotten a good report, and... you know, I'm proud of you, man. It's not up to him, it's up to me, it's up to his counsellor, Mr. Flowers, it's up to the men at the halfway house, if he's ready to move on to the next level. Well, you keep it up, man. The judge says Nathan has to stay in the halfway house and can't move in with his friends. I'm not gonna be moving into that house because one of the guys relapsed there, and then me and the guy who owns the house sort of got into it. I lost my phone. I've gotta call a screen line three times a day, but I don't have a phone, so I gotta like find a phone, which there's no payphones in existence anymore. It's stressful, but I'm just holding on. * This the chopper. This is my baby. This is what I use to protect my life. Shit get real on the road. Like sometimes folks follow you from the club, trying to rob you and stuff. You gotta let the window down and brrt. You know, shoot it out. Blac Youngsta's payday is a new house in a wealthy suburb of Memphis. He paid $380,000 cash, upfront. Yeah, welcome to my home. This is my shit. Boss man shit, young CEO, young entrepreneur. I ain't even moved in this motherfucker yet. I know one thing for damn sure. You gonna put CMG... I'm gonna put CMG in the middle of the floor. The light gonna shine on that bitch, CMG. Gotta get you a big-ass chandelier. For real. Motherfucking police come in this bitch, I'm gonna get the chopper and stand up here like Scarface. We're gonna have a shootout right here, for real. Uh, with the police though? Yeah, whoever come in this motherfucker. Shoot out. You've got the Lord up in here. 'Cause transformation has got to come in all of our lives. - Amen! - Amen! Hallelujah somebody. Personally, I don't think money is the main thing that creates happiness, but it's the things that you need money for, you know, so I would say money is a necessity. It's a necessary evil. Before we get ready to go, let's bless the Lord with our tithes and offerings, amen. Alright. There's a line ready! Fire! I'm always down for a competition. I'm a very, very competitive person, I'm a very aggressive person. If I see something that I want, I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna get it. There's definitely an expiration date on MMA fighting. There's, of course, only so many years that your body can go through that much destruction. The crazy thing is, is that the fighting is the easy part. The training is the hardest part. You gotta have that heart to keep going, to finish. You can't teach somebody that: they either have it or they don't. And that's what makes really good fighters, and that's what makes legendary fighters. * I bought it 'cause I deserve it. Coming from where I come from, it don't happen like this. Like, this shit right here is a dream come true. But I just gotta keep the money coming in to keep this. I can't keep it without no money. So if this house fuck up, the house might cost me 40,000 to 50,000 getting it fixed. So I gotta keep money coming in in order for me to live like this. To be honest, I couldn't picture where I'll be at in 20 years. Five years, I hope to have a degree. I hope to be starting on opening my own business. I always thought if you could have one bake shop where you could like sort of go around with the desserts, I thought that'd be a good idea. That's probably my primary idea, yeah. If you let money rule you, and you don't rule the money, you'll never succeed. You have to reign supreme over your dollar. You have to make the dollar work for you. The Invicta fighting championship sent through my contract, that means that the fight's on. So we're going to Vegas. Nothing's gonna keep me from fighting. After filming this, AmberLynn tore the ligaments in her knee. It'll be 6 months before she can fight again. * Memphis can be a tough place, but these four people have all proven you can adapt and thrive there. And like their city, they've been down, but they've made an effort to come back. You've been here more than me! This shit man, this shit so fucking nice. This shit a dream come true.
