First responders on scene. ICS on scene. Over there! Got something. Extracting body from the water. Lake rescue coming in. Blind receiver please get into position. On my count, haul 'em up. Three, two, one... Ain't that the Reverend Ross? Looks like it got 'em both. Quiet, peaceful... secluded, and has its own dock. Even a little beach down there to get a tan, not that... you need one. Hey! Okay, so you just bought a house in a hole-ass swamp, alone? No, look like a swamp to you? Oh, wow, okay, where's the rest, though? Ah, you know, fix it up, and then the hard part, fixing me up. Mm-mm, mm-mm, stop. You are not broken. You are a work of art in progress. Just be careful, okay? You're lucky that this wasn't worse... much worse. Don't worry about me, I'm good. No... No, I know you're not, but you will be, all right? Remember, every day is new. Yeah. Yeah? I'll call you later. Been using that dock so long it feels like mine. I cut the grass. I'm Zeke. Abbie LeFleur. Don't worry about the dock. I won't be using it much. Fishing's too much sitting and waiting for me. Oh, I won't hold that against you. Ha ha. Um, Anybody warn you not to swim in the lake yet? What do you mean? Oh, I was afraid of that. It's vital you know this, Miss... or ma'am. Miss is fine. Why shouldn't I swim in the lake? The lake's the only reason I bought this place. A gator attacked a young girl and our pastor, killed them both the same night. Hauled them up on that very spot. What? Oh, my God. At least they think it was a gator. Witness said it was something else. Like... Strange things happen here in summer, and the lake brings out the worst, especially when the cicadas are back singing day and night. Uh, when was this? Few years back. '04. Oh, yeah, well, that's a long time for us city folks, but thanks for the warning. Every day is new. All weekend, I was afraid you were gonna call and tell us you changed your mind about us. Worst heatwave in 25 years. Yeah, well, that's a relief. Wasn't sure what normal was around here. So, every jock that's trying to stay on a roster is in your class. Make 'em work for it. Oh, you can be sure of that. You know, you should let me take you to coffee sometime. That diner on Main Street makes a pretty stellar cappuccino. Yeah, think about that. One poet wrote, "Is all that we see, or seem, but a dream within a dream?" That's Edgar Allan Poe. Another poet wrote, "Today is not the day. "It could be, but it is not. Today is today." That's a Black woman named Audre Lorde. What do those poems have in common? You, I'm sorry, what's your name? Derek... Johnson. What are those poems about, Derek? Dying? I mean, one says that everything's a dream, and the other says your time's coming, just not today. They're both about dying. A little young to have death at the tip of your tongue. My cousin Ray died of heatstroke in Jacksonville. He didn't get to do nothing or be nobody. I think about him a lot, and sometimes I think, what if that happens to me? It'll grow you up fast, won't it? You know, the best part of my job is that I get to teach you about life's joys, so why poems about death? Because they're not just about dying, they're about living. If life is but a dream, dream big... While you still can. Okay, homework... You been swimming in the lake, ain't you? I seen you coming out the water. I'm sorry, what? Do you hear the lake calling you? Most people don't hear it. Calling? Like the cicadas, but it ain't. When the lake calls, it ain't calling to your better natures. It's calling to your worst thoughts. It knows your history. My history? What do you mean? Oh, I ain't mean nothing by it. You know what, I think I'm gonna need you to take some time off. with me... with me... All right, don't forget homework. I will be grading. Hey, Derek, hang back a second. Yeah, man. Um, do you know a landscaper or someone who could help with weeding, mulching, that sort of thing? I need some help with some work done around the house. I do all that. I actually helped my dad build a cabin last summer. I know more than you think. Oh, well naughty me. Shouldn't assume. It's, um, not good policy, though, students and teachers. Oh, Coach Reed, he takes us fishing all the time. It's no big deal here. How much? Oh, okay, uh, say, $20 for a couple hours work over a couple of weeks? Mmm, 25. You saving for something? All right, deal, starting today. Oh, uh, okay, but I've got practice at 3:00. Anything else you'd like to negotiate? All right. Try and be there by 5:00. Here's my address. The old house on the lake, yeah, cool. You don't swim there, right? Hey! Yeah, I gotta go, yeah? Hey. I got this job working a couple hours a day. Some teacher needs some help fixing stuff after school. Oh, so the school gave you a job? Oh, no, it's at her house. Her? Yeah, the new one. Wait, that old-ass lady that thinks she's so hot? Oh, here we go, 'cause everyone's after me, even the teachers and the cafeteria lady? No, because you don't get it. Boys never do. The teacher needed a handyman. I mean, you want that prom dress, right, and that limo? And when I go pro, I'm gonna buy us the biggest house you ever saw. - Hey. - Oh, I'm sorry, I'll... No, it's fine, it's fine. Fresh from the oven, but don't be that impressed. It's from a tube at the Piggly Wiggly. Can't believe that's a real store's name. Nah, I actually love these, thanks. What did you mean before, about swimming here? Maybe it's just a scary story for kids, but everyone says bad things happen when you swim in there, especially when it's hot, like now. Bad things? There's something that lives in the lake. I guess that sounds dumb to you, though. Mr. Raines, yeah, he knows, he said he saw it one time, but every time he tells it, the thing gets bigger. I'll let you know if I see Swamp Thing. Oh, that's two hours. I gotta go. Is it okay if I leave it like this for now? Mm-hmm. man: Hello. Hello, Abbie? I'm so worried about you. Abbie, are you there? I'm here to talk whenever you're ready, but you do have to talk. Something's wrong with me. Yes. Abbie, let me get you some help. Jesus, you can't just run away from what happened. What you did to us. Abbie, quit that job before some kid's parents press charge...

Uh, Miss LeFleur. I, uh, I just got a call from an administrator from your school in Boston. She brought something to my attention. We can't discuss it here, but can we meet before class on Monday? Yeah, maybe over that cup of coffee. Don't worry, no teachers' lounge gossips will prosper against me. Okay. I work faster with my baby bro here. I hope that's okay. If you boys are gonna take a break, let's go for a swim. You're not supposed to swim in... Aren't you a little old to be scared of spook stories? I'm not scared. See? It's fine. What's on your ribs? Hey, tell you what, I'll give you 50 bucks apiece if you get in with me. Five minutes, I dare you. What's gonna happen in five minutes? All right, stay close to me, all right? See? I'm still alive.

Bad things happen when you go into the water. It brings out the worst. You do that freehand? Hey, you do that freehand? God damn, I didn't even see you there, bruh. Hey, I like the message. You need to put Nipsey in there, though. - What, Nipsey... - Hey, you got a dollar? Nah, bruh. Aw... So you one-a them Black and bougie niggas, huh? Probably stay up in Buckhead. I wish. Excuse me. You know, when we turn our backs on our brothers, that's when them white devils just slip on... in. Looking good, Nekani. Waylen, haven't seen you around in a minute. Hi, Ms. Lawrence, just, um, admiring the artwork. Mmm-hmm, while you're standing there watching an elder struggle. I'm sorry, Ms. Lawrence, I got you. Thank you, brother. Those are just going in the van. Oop. Oop. See, that's the power of art, the power to inspire solidarity. Mrs. Lawrence, I know a woman who gets paid like $10,000 for each mural she paints. Now, that's the power of art. Now, I know we don't pay ad agency bucks, but I hope you know how much we appreciate you here. I do, Mrs. Lawrence. When we unveil this masterpiece at the fundraiser, boy, we gonna need a wheelbarrow for all the donations. Lawrence Food Bank, this is Billy. Oh... oh, yes, he just walked in. Nekani! For me? Mm-hmm. Okay, I'll take it on my desk. Sounds white. Nekani. The exquisite mural on Degnan. Please tell me you're the artist. Uh, yeah. Well, that is fantastic. I'm so glad I caught you. I drove by your artwork today, and I just had to slam on the brakes. Oh, wow, um... thank you. What kind of art is that? Would you call that Afro-centric art? Um, I guess. Just perfect. Do you design symbols? I would love to hire you for a little side project. Please tell me you're available. I mean, I'm working long hours the next few days, and I got to finish up the mural so, you know, after that, maybe I could... I totally understand, but the thing is I need it by tonight. I could pay you right away. Does $1,000 seem fair? I mean, I'm gonna have to miss work so... I'm gonna need more. I have no idea how much these things cost. How about $5,000. Does that seem fair? Uh, sure, you know what? I think I could fit it in. If you just email me the instructions, I can get started on it tonight. Oh, sorry, the instructions have to be relayed verbally, and you should definitely write them down, 'cause it's crucial you follow them exactly. Uh, okay, uh... First draw a circle. Inside that circle draw a 45-degree angle with an interstice at the bottom-most point of the circle... That looks like some Hollywood sex cult shit. It's not for a sex cult, is it? I don't even know. All I know is the client has given me nothing but verbal instructions, and these instructions are like, "Create two 45-degree angles from the endpoint of the first, "with the left point extended downward to the right, and the right point to the left"...yeah. Yeah, that sounds like a riddle, I hope you charging a riddle fee for this. All I know is he promised 5 Gs if I finish before sunset. 5,000 for one symbol? Are you should this is legit? I don't even know. If not, I definitely wasted a few hours of labor, but if it is, that's my whole credit card debt, - that's for sure. - Okay, that's what's up. You know what, if I get another gig like this, I'm getting that white Canyon Grail in the window at Van's. What you need a $4,000 bike for while there's people starving in the streets? I'm sorry for the people who are starving, but... Wow... Send. Here we go. Okay, big money, what you want to eat? Pffft. Well, the question is what do I have? Okay, looks like you got one frozen cauliflower pizza crust and an empty bottle of soy sauce. Taco truck it is. Let's get pastor from that one on Peachtree. Yes. Oh shit. Yo. Fuck a taco truck. We eating sushi tonight. Oh, shit! I'm sorry... w-what happened? Whatever it was, it happened overnight. I mean, damn, can anybody survive that much blood loss? Already looked. All I found was a tallboy. It was Waylen's brand. Waylen? Oh, that dude was kind of trash anyway. Hey, B, you see all that blood out there, man? Mm-hmm, it's horrible. Oh, good morning, Ms. Lawrence. Nekani. Nekani, I'm so glad I caught you. Listen, I need a new symbol. Please tell me you have time. Oh, hey, I hope you enjoyed the last one. It was perfect. You have no idea. By the way, thank you so much for paying so early. Oh, the only thing is the next one I need before sunset. Before sunset? I'd have to take off early, and today's my last day to finish the mural, I... I just love the way you're so committed to your community. It's so cool. How about this... what if I made a matching donation to the food bank, $5,000 for you, $5,000 for them. Oh, wow, uh... Or I could give you the whole $10,000... your choice. Oof, ah... hey, Ms. Lawrence. Nekani, how's it going out there? Good, good, good, you know, just finished up the line work. But I'm, uh... I'm feeling a little under the weather. I think I may need to go home and lie down, I'm sorry. Seeing all that blood freaked me out, too. Why don't I get Jay to sit out there with you... No, no, Ms. Lawrence, it's not the blood, I'm sick. I think I got food poisoning or something. All of our biggest donors are going to be at this fundraiser tomorrow, and your mural's supposed to be the main attraction. I know, but... This is our community, Nekani. That means showing up. Go on. - It's just... - Spit it out, Mr. Harris. I mean, you never hear white people guilt tripping each other about their community. White people don't need to look out for each other. They built whole systems to make sure they stay on top. All we got is community. But if you're feeling sick, then go home and get well... we'll make do. Ms....Mrs. Lawrence... Mrs. Lawrence, I mean, maybe if I feel better, maybe I can come back tonight and finish it up. Mrs. Lawrence? What the hell? Oh! Jesus, Cordell. Damn, you were focussed. Just trying to finish up. All right, all right, well here, smell this... it's a long roast Ethiopian, it's kind of sour, but it's really crisp, right? We're thinking this one for our fall roast, and check this out... Badie was saying he wanted to try something bold for the bag design and I was like, "Have I ever told you my man is an amazing graphic designer?" I'd love to see some of your work, Nekani. Um, I'm actually working on a gig right now, and I got to finish before sunset so... Could you just pull up your portfolio? I was telling him about the album cover - that you did for Reese. - I'm busy. Just real quick.

People out here calling on Satan his damn self to wipe Black folks out. Wait, what... how do you even know that? People come in here with all types of suspicious ass tattoos? Black business owner... I gotta keep up on my hate symbols. Oh my God, see, I knew this was shady. I mean, they're similar, but they're not exactly the same. It's probably just a coincidence.

Yeah, 'cause you would have stayed mooching off your mom the rest of your life if I hadn't pushed you to do something with your art, and you damn sure ain't the one trying to push our relationship to the next level. You know what, you're just mad because you can't stand to see me thriving on my own terms. I'm finally getting mine, and I did it without you. Well, you're about to be doing a lot of shit without me. Now, you been eyeing this bike for months. Mmm, somebody must have answered my prayers, I am so ready to level up. You know what, good for you, they say treating yourself is a healthy way to deal with trauma. Trauma? I heard about what happened to Ms. Lawrence. It was just on the news. They said she was gutted like some kind of ritual sacrifice. She did so much for this community, man, like how could anybody do that to another human being? People are sick, bro... look, my bad, look, you ready to level up, man? Uh, I need to... H-hello? Nekani, I'm so glad I caught you, I have a... You... you, what is your name and what are those symbols for? It's just a little personal project, and you've been so great to work with. I just need one more little symbol... My boss was murdered! Did you... did you have anything to do with this? I'm so sorry to hear that, but I promise you I didn't have any more to do with that... than you did. Listen, you sound stressed, and I sure don't want to add to that, but I really need this. I'm not doing any more. How does $20,000 sound? Hey, man, I'm gonna head out. I gotta go work this out with Nekani. All right, well I hope you can talk some sense into your boy. I gotta try. I love his little problematic ass. Can't help it. Agh, I can't be doing this. Why am I doing this shit? 20 plus 10 plus 5... that's 35 fucking Gs. Fuck it. What is that? Cordell? It's me. Aah... ohh! Nekani, chill. What are you doing in my bedroom? I have something to share with you. You and I did this together. No, no, no, no, I didn't do shit! Well, you drew the symbols. Each one was an invitation to take another soul, and with each soul, he grew. No, no, no, I didn't know what I was doing. Sure you did. This isn't gonna work unless the invoker knows the cost of his actions. It's the corruption that gives the magic its power, and he only needs one more soul. Who the fuck is he? Agh, he comes faster and faster every time. What the fuck is that? The beating heart of a supreme people. - Uhh... - Oh, no... Aghhh! Aah! Oh no, oh no! What the... no, no, no, no! Oh, my fucking God! He's almost complete. What the fuck?! Cordell! What is happening? He just needs one more soul, then it's over. And you'll get your money. No, no, no, no... No! You got your soul, what else do you want? I want... more. No... Ahhhh! I need to tell you our story. It's not just men who hunger, who want, who leave a place to make something of themselves. Women want just as much and the world lets us down just as hard. Be good, now. Tradition dictates that the firstborn marries first and so on. By the time tradition chose to visit me, I was too ripened to be too particular. Are you ready to begin your new life as Mrs. Theodus Bethell Clay? Oh, yes. Why is that spinning wheel there? Came this morning with the luggage, sir. Didn't know where to put it. My dear, we discussed you leaving that back in New York. Yes, and we compromised that it could go in the bedroom, where we will keep many things away from the prying eyes of the 400 and the colored aristocracy. There's better recreation in Washington than spinning cotton like a common slave. Theodus was kind enough, if overly concerned about the opinions of others. Well, it was spinning cotton that kept my people from being a common slave. The wheel got us out of the field and the loom got us out of Virginia and up to Harlem. Better as a hobby than anything else, don't you think? Yes. Well, Sabine will show you the rest of the house. Now, you two, please, unload the wagon. Theodus and his Reconstruction-made fortune of 60,000. Rich men, even the blackest ones, have more freedom than I could ever imagine. Do you like it? Isn't she beautiful? My comfort in Washington and escape back to New York City relied on me. Theodus had promised we'd move back after he expanded his business and we expanded our family. I needed to provide a baby. He chose me to provide the right kind of baby. Months passed. I don't know if it was my soil or his seed, but such matters of gardening would eventually be blamed on me. The pleasure in trying gave out and he sought comfort elsewhere. I had to spin to calm my head and my heart. It's what my mother taught me. I brought you supper. Mr. Clay? Going out. 'Til late, I expect. - You wanna try? - They only allowed us to put hands on cotton to pick it. It's a valuable skill to have. You wanna learn? Maybe, uh, we could help each other? Those scars on your face... I don't wanna presume, but do you know the local root woman? My mama's sister. Take me to your auntie? With the nursery empty, I had to take matters into my own hands. - This is Mrs.... - I know who she is and what her type want. I need to get with child. You wouldn't be here if you could tend your own yard. A boy. Better for the child. Girls get treated like horses, don't they? And I don't wanna remember it. Not you, not comin' here, not your root magic, none of it. The seed will take your memory of me and all the parts of birthing that bring about pain and not joy. Mine already wants to forget. It's the only reason women keep having babies after the first one tears his way out. Seed will hold your memory. What else? You gotta say it. The child must favor me, not his father. Because Theodus Clay is more midnight than twilight. You wanna breed the Blackness out your child, it'll cost you. More than we've been payin' since they first held us down with chains to lay with us. Sabine, be sure to get my money. I don't care what anyone says. This close to the Mason-Dixon, you're in the South. Theodus would have preferred me to engage in Washington society, but it was nothing like New York so I preferred to spin at my wheel. That made me a target of gossip. Theodus despised the wagging tongues, but he was thrilled about the baby. What's... it's coming. You want somethin' to bite down on? I need you to push. Push. Push! Push... push. Breathe. I was told it was a difficult labor, that I nearly lost my child that night. I think I nearly lost my soul. Hello, Cornelius. I wanted to believe that everything was normal, even after the walls started to cry. That sound... it pulled at my memory, but I resisted. How's my son? First of many. My body's all torn up and you already planning more damage? What is that? Small animals get trapped inside the walls of these types of houses. Huh. That happen a lot down here in the swamp? Could be a ghost. As big as this house is, a ghost could have its own wing. A small animal or a ghost, that I could accept. Cornelius Clay... he was perfect. Four generations of freed men and that bright skin and straight hair, good breeding, clubs and cotillions, summer on the Chesapeake. The world loved him. But he had a solitary temperament and kept his own counsel, like his mother. Except when it came to Sabine. Old house is singing a sad song today, Sabine. If it had a face to go with that voice, then we could sit and talk. Maybe play cards. Haints like cards. Now, hey, Sabine, daddy said white folk and us respectable coloreds have ghosts... not haints. Sabine, who never seemed surprised, or scared, or questionin' of anything the House did. Miss Clara is in the parlor waiting on you. She come talk about the wedding? Yes, flowers, the cake, her dress is in from Paris, your suit is in from London, which needs alterations. I'd rather talk to the haint. You want me to get rid of her? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you disapprove of this wedding. I happen to love Clara Cox Lenworth. Ahem. Clara, whose father promised her to the son of a fellow Boulé man, who graduated Howard the same year and had a family pew at St. Luke's. Clara, whose father was worth enough he didn't blink at a wedding that cost upwards of $20,000. Whenever I'm in this house, I feel like someone's lookin' over my shoulder. Could be. In this town, someone's always minding your business, in particular. Clara. I see my firstborn has finally made his way to you. Firstborn? I'm your only born, Mama, unless you and Daddy finally fixing to gimme that little brother. Oh, no, I was just being formal. I got it from here, Sabine. Thank you. Okay. Uh, cream or sugar, daughter-to-be... I'm so sorry, my memory's been fussin' me lately. No need to apologize, mother-to-be, that's how I take it. Here you are. Three more weeks and no more of this to-be business... I will finally have a daughter. What is that sound? Cornelius, is this your ghost? Maybe it wants to introduce itself to the future Mistress of the House. Hello, ghost. I'm going to have all these holes fixed after the wedding, so start packin'. Cornelius and his father been talking about ghosts for years... I think there's some raccoons in the attic. And I think they need to leave. Yes? Mr. Clay won't be home for lunch. He sent word that he's busy at the office. That's to be expected. Could you go and put some poison down in the attic? Raccoons are playin' up again today. Yes, ma'am. Shall we? After all of it, after Sabine told me what happened, I realized that Clara was simply unlucky. Her father promised her to the wrong Boulé man. Whose cat is that? It's just a stray. I feed them from time to time. So that's the mystery of the attic... Sabine's secret cat circus? No, ma'am. You heard those noises. Raccoons or ghosts? Whichever you prefer, Miss Clara. The true strangeness in this house was her poundin' on the walls and livin' on her spinnin' wheel. Mrs. Clay spins to be close to her ancestors. Hmm, I hope she takes them with her when she goes back to New York. This one's always locked. Yes, ma'am. Then it must be 'coons. Ghosts don't care much for locked doors. Open it and let me see. This looks like the one. Clara had been spoiled, taught from her first breath that everything belonged to her. Perhaps that was true, until her last breath. Clara was laid out, like a strange golden fruit cut down from a tree. Clara! Sabine was the strong one. If we don't handle this right, we're all good as dead. She knew what we had to do. A spider bite. One of those big brown ones. Big as mice, they are. But regular as any other spider. Clara was beloved. News of her death made all the papers. "A Tragic Spider Bite." Most folks didn't believe it. They told us without words. The looks at church, the invitations that dried up. Theodus fled the condemnations of Washington for Greenwood to "build a new business," he said. I begged my son to take me back to New York, but he had to save himself before he could save anyone else. He escaped with his father. I couldn't go home with nothin' but a damaged reputation, so I stayed in the house. It felt like I spent months, or was it years, spinnin' to keep the devil out my mind, but the devil was up there, anyway, kicking up a fuss. Sabine is the only one who stayed with me. The other servants left. My men stayed away. Cornelius was grieving, Theodus was embarrassed. He thought I'd found the madness I was seeking. I know he found himself a new woman. I looked deeper into my past. I thought the ancestors were telling me to weave. I know now they were tryin' to tell me something else. Sorry to drop in on you like this, Mama. We won't stay long. Josephine's mother's waiting for us back at the Whitelaw Hotel. We'll have some lemonade, please, Sabine. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. You look well, Cornelius. Like your father's new woman been takin' good care of you both. Negro Wall Street is just thrivin'. There's lots of work down there for the father-son law practice. That's how Cornelius and I met. And what are you to each other now, exactly? I see you've moved your spinnin' wheel, Mama. Keepin' yourself busy? Cornelius, I asked you a question. Look, uh, there's no... no easy way to... Josephine and I got married last month. No, not married?! You got married? Without telling your mother? Cornelius was the key. He was the salvation I needed. It would have been cleaner if he'd come alone. Cleaner, but still tragic. I wanted you there, but it all happened so fast. We're expectin' a baby. Sorry to do it this way, Mama. Sabine. That's why I came back so you can meet my bride. Sweet heaven, what is that? No. No, you won't do this to us again! No! Racoons or ghosts, I don't care, just leave us be! Please, please just leave us be! Sabine! Excuse me. Shh! Shh. Please. Shhh. Cornelius is sorry. He doesn't know what he doesn't know. Shh. We should take your mama back to Tulsa with us. This would drive anyone crazy. I'll go tell her. Did you do this? No. No. Well, how'd it get there? - Oh, Cornelius. - What are you two whispering about up here? - No, Cornelius, just... - Cornelius, Cornelius. Are these... bones? Ah! What's been going on in this house? It ain't my place to tell you! You got to remember! Want to remember! It ain't fair that you don't know, either! You not knowing ain't no kind of excuse, not when it comes to tradition. You shouldn't have been married first. Married. Josephine! - No! - Cornelius! Oh, my God, no! No, not Josephine! This house never been haunted. There's something else here. A monster. Where are you? Come out and face me! What are you? The firstborn and the twice punished... your sister. I've been here this whole time, waiting for my mama to claim me. The first wedding's my right, not yours, little brother. A bride for me before a bride for you. My sister? No, not my son! Don't hurt my son! This is because of you, Mama? All of this?! I've been cursed! This house is crazy! This ain't even the whole cost. Sabine. I need to remember. Lord, protect her. God, please save her. What is it? What's wrong with my baby? Is he okay, is he breathin'? Is he... Get rid of it. Get rid of it. Theodus can't know. There's another baby comin'! Bury it! Go! The whole world forces colored women to do terrible things. Sometimes we force ourselves to forget. It's the least we deserve. It's not just you. Mr. Du Bois would like to know just how many holes his Talented Tenth been putting in their backyard. Difference being, your hole is empty and what come out been livin' alongside you, knowing what it was denied. It's got a right to be rageful. I knew exactly what I had to do. You've been wanting my attention since the moment you were born. All your crying and... scratchin' and killin'. It's mothering you want... then I'm here to give it. So, come on out. I need to tell you a story. It's not just men who hunger, who want, who leave a place to make something of themselves. Women want just as much. The world lets us down just as hard. Harder. Listen here. Be still. I'm so, so sorry. I'm so sorry you've never felt your mama's touch... Until now. She said I had to split the skin and dig! Dig until... I freed you. They teach us to hate ourselves. Our skin first, and then to hate each other. You have always been there. My sweet baby girl. We create the monsters they force us to become, and when they come for us, I will burn with you, my firstborn. Well, theoretically, one might classify almost any religion as a cult. What I'm saying is, just as relationships can go wrong, so can organizations. The line between a religion and a cult is as amorphous as the line between mud and water. My religion is your cult if you don't believe in my God or my customs. - A cult has... - See, I told you. You said my grandmama is in a cult. On TV, while I was watching at her house. But you know what? I think it is kinda... kinda sexy CNN called you, though. - Yeah, you like that? - Yeah. I like it a lot. But I'm gonna need you to learn one word before you go national. What's that? No. As in, if anyone asks you if Christianity... is a cult, what is your answer? It is a lot more than just yes or no. Oh, is it? - Yeah. - No. No, come... okay, think about it. - No. - Think about it! - I don't want to. - Think about it, okay, what if that's the hook? At what point does religion become a cult or a cult, religion? What are the lines of demarcation when things become toxic, okay? When the sermons are about racism or homophobia? Dr. Berry, are you saying here on national TV that Christianity is indeed a cult? No. Oh, yeah. Say it again. I'm not saying that any major religion... - Ooh! - is a cult, I'm only saying... - Shh, stop talking, - if you... Shh! Stop talking. You had me at "no." - Yeah. - Yeah, you did. Where are you headed so early? Is this that little place on Hardy? Mm-hmm. The Church of the Redeemer wasn't bringin' them crowds. And you are going, why? Well, been listenin' to this podcast from this pastor, Reverend Pike. It's, uh, classic cult language patterns, y'know. Research the only thing gonna get me up this early on a Sunday. Another case study. Thought I had Sundays off, boss. Davesh and I were attacked. Wha... when? What happened? Last night, somebody tried to run us down. And, Charlotte, his face was red. Fuck. Are you... are you good? It was pretty close. Too close. What about D? Only a scraped arm, thank God. Charlotte, my heart is still racing. 'Kay, where did this happen? Was this near your house? No, it was Little Five Points near D's new office. Another flag for your map. All the attackers had red faces, but the locations... there's no clear pattern yet, but most of the victims have some kind of connection to hospitals or... or medicine or... Thin, but Charlotte, I've started to believe you more than I trust the police. "Maybe somebody was having a bad night," he said. I mean, what the hell? Listen, I'm gonna file my story today, maybe help the cops put together the pieces. And Jaya, you and Davesh did not deserve this. Nobody does. - What happened? - Some asshole almost - ran over Jaya and Davesh. - What? They're okay, it's just... This world. - I know. - Come here. Aw. - I'm sorry, babe. - Okay. Damnation is... Is this that Third Way guy? Yep. Not just loons are paying attention... now our neighbors attend, or they used to. He gave 'em the flyer a couple months back. No, Mr. Franic did not. Oh, yes, Mr. Franic did. So, I figured I'd better check it out for myself, I mean, if these guys are listening to that megalomaniacal bullshit... You never know people, do you? You sure don't. I gotta run. Babe, uh, why don't you drive? It's gettin' kinda weird out there, so... Sure. Why get sweaty? Got my exercise last night in the tub. Mrow. I'm on deadline. Help me out here. I'm not in a position to comment at this time. Come on, Detective, you have to give me something. You won't stop hassling me, will you? We've seen a surge in reports of suspicious activity and incidents of assault have increased with victims reporting their attackers wearing red face paint, but they're random, no concrete connection. That's nothing I don't already know. Listen, I know this is personal for you, but that's all I've got. Sorry. Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike, Pike! Pike, Pike, Pike! Babe, they're called brakes! Of course, of course. Okay... Oh, listen, uh, before I forget, the booker wants to know if you can do CNN Tuesday instead of Wednesday? But I thought you have class, right? Babe, what should I tell CNN? Uh... C... Acetaminophen. It's Tylenol. Do you have a headache? Um... I'll do it. I'll do it. See? Damnation is in the faces of the unbelievers, the outsiders, the intruders. Their false prophets drive us into flames, and why? Because we are dazzled by the spell... Arthur? Who's there?! Fuck around and find out! Arthur?! Whoops. Key got stuck. Where were you? Church. At 3:00 in the morning? I'm gonna clean up. I think you should come with me to Third Way. To see him. To open your eyes and really see. You're going again? Already? Babe. This isn't you. B... Babe! - Baby. - Ideas. These lies... - Talk to me. - Destroy our bodies and our souls. There is a Third Way. Okay. I'll go. Thank you. What's this? Babe, I want you to... to read just a paragraph from this. From anywhere. Just a line. I just wanna hear you read it, 'kay? And if you can do that for me, I'll go to church with you. Any one. Why would I? - It's old. - You can't. You can't read it, can you? And if you can't admit it to me, will you at least admit it to yourself? Arthur, admit why you quit your job! Why you don't drive anymore, why you canceled the interview that you have been chasing down for months. Baby, something is wrong. That... that... that job, it was... it was, uh, a tric... it was... It was... it was dumb! Dumb?! Do you hear yourself?! "Dumb"?! You have to go to the doctor. You told me that you would go with me to church! You lied. Hmm? - You tricked me. - No! No. That was mean. The false prophets tell you they know the world, but it is their poison killing the world. No, Davesh, it's not getting any better, it's getting worse. Give me an example. He can't read at all. I'm sure if it now... it's not my imagination. He's scared to death, but he will not admit it. Can you bring him in today? He won't. He's obsessed with this preacher who's always talking shit about science, and that is what he's hiding behind so that he doesn't have to face it. This is not like him at all. We talked about a 72-hour hold. Wha... against his will? I can't do that to him. He would never forgive me. Besides, he's out late, and I don't think that he's ever tried to hurt himself. And no evidence of drug use? No, no, no, no, no, it's not that, it's... Davesh, I'll call you back. Slow down. Now tell me again what you saw. A woman with her face painted red, lurking behind a tree, staring at our neighbor's house, but now she's gone. Did you see anything else, anything we can use? We've been getting these reports but haven't been able to confirm anything. I miss you. I'm right here. No. You're not. It's not you. It's not you anymore. It is me. The real me. I'm free. Like... my big brain was getting in the way, so I couldn't... see. But I can now. Ha. Thanks to Pike's church. Love is my church, Arthur. You. And if I lose you, I'm not gonna find you in some little building down the street. Pike is taking advantage... No. Stop. Ss-ss-ss. You have to believe. Believe. It's all that'll save you. It's all that'll save any of us. Um... I think I wanna be alone right now. Please. Classic cult phenomena, reminiscent of Jim Jones. Now he's looking right at me. "In his eyes"? "Can't see"? Fuck. Baby. Babe, listen to me. You have had some kind of an event, maybe a s-stroke. You see? And we can tell exactly when it happened at the church. The first day... do you remember? - It takes courage... - See? Arthur, you have to go to the doctor. Do you understand? - It takes courage... - Can you hear me? Arthur! If you love me, you will do this for me. Arthur. Do you remember the promise that you made to take care of yourself, right? And to trust that I love you enough... to listen. Yeah. I trust you. Please. Baby, do what I am asking. But Pike says we can't go. Just forget about the lunatic for just a moment, okay? The people who follow him are crazy, and we... Don't talk about me like that! Don't talk about him - like that! - Arthur, no! You are not a believer! Don't sit in the darkness and pretend that it's sunshine. Lies to the self... they're the worst of all! These prophets in their white coats, they want you to be afraid of the truth! He is the truth! Come to the feast! No! Arthur... Arthur... Arthur. We heard shouting. Is he all right? Are you? I'm fine. I'm fine, he just had an episode. What does his doctor say? He won't go. The Third Way. We knew Pike before when that church was the Redeemer. Lovely man, but, uh... he's different now. His ideas, they are dangerous, a poison in the mind. Leela... When did he change? About a year ago. He had an accident, auto. When he came out of his coma, he spoke of a Third Way, visions and fools in white coats who pollute our bodies. Like me, yes? I was a pharmacist. The things he says, his church, it's just not for us. So now we are... unbelievers. We really shouldn't say more. My kapustnica's on the stove. I need to pick up some onions. Thank you. - I'm going to store. - Bye. - Love you. - Love you, too. I don't know what to say to him. I can't... I can't get inside his head, like, I can't see what he's seeing or what he's thinking. You know, my grandmother had Alzheimer's and the best way to convince them is to enter their world with them. Let them believe that you know them. Understand them. You mean like go to that stupid church with him? Maybe just go in for once? I mean, Reverend Pike has to be fulfilling some needs of Arthur's... why won't he lean on you? I think he's going there now. All right, I gotta go follow him. This is my chance. I'll call you back. Oh, Xander! Distorted fairy tale called the Bible speaks of good, and it speaks of evil, but there is a Third Way... that is the right way. Despite the labels that others will use, when your friends and your neighbors need you, where will you be? Right here! Yes, when the demons descend to steal what you got, where will you be? Right here! When the doctors and scientists create diseases to kill your children, and steal your bank account to cure the diseases that they have created, where will you be? - Right here! - Who am I? - The way! - Who am I? - The bringer! - Who am I? - A murderer! - Ahhhh! - Stop her! - Grab her... now! You. You... you... ou... Come. Come... come... come... Drink. Drink... drink... drink... Taste. Feast on the unholy. Charlotte? Arthur? Aaah! Come here, come here, shh, shh, come here. Come... Come here. Come on, we gotta let Mommy see you. Mom snores real loud. Don't let Mommy hear you say that. Stay close to me, bud. Can I press the button this time? Yeah, go ahead and do it. I'm impressed that he asked first. What's wrong with that man's legs? He can't walk or something? So much for good manners. - I'm sorry. - Aw, it's okay, it's okay. I can walk. I just need a little help. I can even walk on my hands, just not for very long. I remember when my daughter was that small. Felt like I was back around the fire. What fire? The first fire. I'm talking caveman times. My girl was born, and I knew immediately, my job was to protect her. Becoming a father, it pulls you back when we were living in the wilderness, gathered 'round the fire, surrounded by the night. I know how I sound. You were put here to protect him. Don't turn your head for a minute. Wow. That man was not reassuring. You've been doing such a good job lately. I don't know why that old man is always trying to lecture me. We're going to be fine, babe, I believe in you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no, no. You almost stepped on a land mine. Good thing you were there. Let me down please, I'll avoid the landmine. Okay, okay. I'll see you boys in a minute. Can you go - and get me some fruit? - Yeah. And if they have kiwi, can you get us two? - Okay. - Perfect, bye. Bye. - Should we get some kiwi? - Yeah. Bye. Come on, let's find some fruit for Mommy. Oh, wow, you see the dragon and stuff? Oh yeah, I think it might be the Chinese festival. - Yeah? - It looks like it. I want to go to the Chinese festival... oh, snap, come here. Dig in the box. Come on, let's get some fruit. Come on, you got it? Come on, I got it. What fruit can we get? Make sure we get some kiwi. - Oh, yeah. - Give me that right there. I'll hold on to that. I'll get the fruit and stuff. Hey, James! James! James! Hey, I got you. I got you. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, we're good. We're good, we're good, we're good. - Are you sure? - I'm just not gonna put you down. I'm not gonna put you down 'til we get home, okay, all right? We're good, I got you, okay? I'm never gonna lose you. Hey, how you doing? That just don't make no damn sense. She's in graduate school, my daughter. She's going to be a biochemist. You don't sound too happy about that. Well, I'm proud of her, of course, but we don't talk. I find out about her life through Facebook. Why doesn't your daughter talk to you? What if I told you I don't know? I'm sorry, that just sounds kind of weak. You've been a daddy, what, a couple years? Try keeping it up for 10, 20. You start off a good man, but there's so many ways it can go bad. You can't go back to your old self. All right, no peeking. - I'm not peeking! - I feel like you are. A little further, yeah, yeah, no peeking. Okay, open 'em up. Whoa. Pfff, pfff, pff! - Whoa. - Mm-hmm. - This is... - Yeah. J-A-M-E-S, James. - You like it? - Yes. Yeah? James, my boy, listen, you're the light of our lives, joy of our days, man. You got to start sleeping in your own bed, okay? Because you're killing us, all right? Don't tell him that! I'm joking, but you know I'm not joking. Go ahead, lay down, check it out... check it out, this is yours. Is... this a dog bed? It was on a clearance sale at a pet shop. - It... it's not used. - I hope not. Come on, I got everything taken care of. I feel like I'm in outer space, the final frontier. We're coming in. Wow, I really didn't expect this. You see, at night, all of this will glow in the dark for him. Wow. - Yeah. - That's amazing. I did good? You did great. Come outside. Are you sure about this? You had him all day. You haven't had a night out, what, in four years? Yeah, I'm sure. I'm just going to go have wine with my sister. Can I have some? No, baby boy, you just got to stick to milk. Mmm. I think you guys will be all right. You know I don't really trust Dad. Don't you think this would be easier with a real knife? I think so. There we go, aw, there we go, that big 'ol noggin. Running down on the end, you see the kite? - You ever flown a kite before? - Mm-mm. No? We gotta get you to fly a kite, it's amazing. Come outside! Come outside. Come outside. Morning, junior, how'd you sleep? Hopefully better than your old man, right? - Come outside. - Okay, yeah, we'll go out, let's have some breakfast first, yeah? ♪ Come outside ♪ Why do you keep saying that? The man at the window said that, "Come outside." Real talk. Did anyone even read the story? Keisha, can you let your fellow classmates know what the story's about? It's about a man on a ship coming to New York from Europe. World War II just finished, he's Jewish and he never wants to go back to Europe because they did his people dirty. He wants to start a new life in America, so he takes a boat to NYC. The trip is almost over, but while he's on deck looking for the Statue of Liberty, he meets someone, but it's not a person, not exactly, it's a demon. Do you remember what happens next? They fight, right there, they wrestle. That's right, Keisha, but it's not a demon that he's fighting, it's, uh... So you're really gonna sleep in here? I'm just gonna stay until he goes down. I feel like an astronaut in here... can I be one, Mommy? Of course you can. Here I am thinking I was gonna have a hard time with separation. You really stayed in here the whole night? Didn't mean to. Be quiet. Excuse me? Be quiet! You can't be talking to your daddy like that, and I know you're not talking to me like that. He's listening. - What is this boy saying? - I don't... I don't know. Be quiet, he's listening. Who's listening? The man at the window said that... he said it all night. What? Who did you see? What man outside your window? Were you out on the fire escape peeking in my son's window? I'm gonna say this as clear as I can. You're messing with the wrong one. You sure I'm the one you should be warning? You remember telling me I was sent here to protect my child? I do. I would die for my son. I will kill for my son. is that clear enough? You know, in most families, the danger doesn't come from some stranger, the danger comes from someone you already know, someone you love. Are you talking bad about my wife, huh? Try me one more time, come near my family one more time, and I'm gonna show you exactly what kind of man I can be. Well, I warned him. I warned him. What's going on with you? You know, I never even knew my father's name. This boy knows your touch, the sound of your voice. He knows your name. Daddy. Yeah, that's my name. Aah! James? He's gone. James. James. James, where are you? Mr. Hoffman, you said it wasn't a demon the man in the story was fighting, but you didn't say what it was. The term is doppelganger. A German writer came up with it in 1796, but the idea is much older. Doppelganger, it's your double, a version of you that's almost exactly the same. Almost? On the outside it looks like you, but on the inside it's worse. So, the man on the ship was fighting himself? A version of himself, yes, and only one was going to survive. Good night? Real good. You with me? There's no place I'd rather be. Good... because... I need you to take out the trash now. What you looking at, old man? Do I know you? I thought so, but I guess I was wrong. Fire. No, you have places, agh. Gah. Clean up on aisle five. The man at the window. You can call me Daddy now. Ugh. Babe, wait up! Shanita, wait up! Come on, Marcus catch up, it's hot! I know it's hot. I'm trying to get done, my feet hurt. Your feet always hurt, all right, uh... if I'm not mistaken... that's the last one right there. - Oh, hell no. - What? This house is suspect as fuck, Marcus. See, there you go making value judgments again. Yeah, I value my life. Back when I was in Afghanis... Afghanistan, yes, the whole squad followed your instincts, heard that. Because I was always right, Marcus. Yeah, oh, that I know too, but guess what, you're not in Afghanistan. Look, we're out here canvassing for a Black candidate that can actually win a seat in the senate, in West Virginia. Hey, I'm telling you things have changed. Yeah, okay, things have changed, we've been out here all afternoon. The only other people we've spoken to... other canvassers. What does that tell you, Marcus? That everybody at work? All right, go ahead Obama, knock, go ahead. Wait a minute. Get my mace. Woman, come on. Hello. What? Ellie, didn't I tell you not to answer the door? I'm trying to sleep. With the TV on?! Are you sassing me? - What do you want? - Okay, all right, all right. Hi, my very sweet wife and I are campaigning for Sarah Carson, and we just want to know if you know who your mom is voting for? They want to know who you're voting for. Tell 'em I'm voting for the nigger. See? See? I'm not gonna say it Marcus. - Thank you. - You already know. You already know, you already know... - Hey. - What's up? Welcome back. Y'all have more luck than us? - Let's see, one. - We met zero. I grew up about an hour and a half from this place and I ain't never heard of it. It's a waste of time, it's a damn ghost town. Has anybody seen a bathroom? The bathroom's in the post office. All right, see you in a minute. I ain't had service since I drove in. I can barely get the campaign app to work. Y'all ain't from West Virginia, are ya? All the mountains and hollers around here, cell service can be spotty. This whole town, man, I don't know what's going on... Shanita: Marcus! Nita! Nita! Nita! Babe, what's wrong, you okay, what happened? - Oh my God! - I didn't even see that when I came in here earlier. Why's it there? It's a sundown town. Jesus, guys, it's not that big a deal, it's the past. Yeah, maybe not to you. Dude, I'm out here campaigning for a Black candidate, man, things have changed. That was all a really long time ago. Clearly not. Babe, let's get out of here, excuse us. That was awkward. You gotta take me home. Oh, I'm taking you home. You gotta be kidding me. Marcus, if you don't get me out of this nightmare... Babe, I got it... hey, said I got it, I got it. I said I got it. Seriously, dude? Did you do this... what is wrong with you? Excuse me? Why would you flatten our tires, I am calling the police. You better back up, Abercrombie and Bitch. Hey, hey, hey, come on now! There's no way that he did this. They were only out here for a few minutes, and their tires are flat too. It's getting late, what are we gonna do? Ain't nothing for miles around here. Post Office might have a landline, - I'll go check it out. - I'll go with you. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. Honestly, I cannot think right now, can you stop? No, I cannot stop. God damn, no spare tires. - What's going on? - Nothing. I checked everywhere. - No phone? - No phone. Y'all hear that? What is it? That is weird. Sounds like a violin. Oh, hell no, hell no, no, no, Marcus. Welcome to Evantide. I'm Constantine Erebus. I'm the mayor of this beautiful little town. You must be the canvassers, all right, you see, the campaign told me you were coming. We were canvassing earlier, but no one was home. Oh yeah, you see, our hours are a little different. You know, someone flattened all our tires. What, flattened your tires? Who would do such a thing? Oh... well, I promise y'all, we're going to help you with them tires. You know what, you're all pretty lucky because you came on the night of the moonlight festival. It's gonna be a lot of food. I hope y'all are hungry. So please... Follow me. We're not following him, Marcus. We're not following him, right? You're just followin' him? - Hey... - Y-y'all gonna foll... - What are you... - Babe, look... Oh, man, I just want some mashed potatoes... I ain't never seen this kind of weird white shit either, but... Let me tell you something, he got a fiddle. Not me... not your girl. Hey, hey, hey, I know it's weird, but he did say he could help us with the tires and we definitely need help with the tires. - You need to come on. - All right, Marcus. Come on. Everything about this is weird, I just want you to know that. Yeah, I noticed, it's weird, you got that right. Ah, welcome! Ha ha ha ha! It's that girl. Dinner's gonna be served in a bit so in the meantime, just enjoy our hospitality. Hey man, what's up with the sign? Excuse me? The sign in the Post Office telling Black folks to get out before sundown? Wait... wait, Sammy, Sammy! Sammy! Hey, hey, Mr. Arabus. Sammy, our friends here, they say they saw a troubling sign in the post office, I mean, I thought we took 'em all down? Hmm, I thought we took them down too, but, uh, I'll get on it right away, sorry about that Mr. Arabus, sorry. This town used to have signs like that hung up in various places, but that's in the past now. Yeah, thank God, and when we moved here, I made sure all those signs were taken down, but, you see, because of the way we live, pranksters they come in during the day and they cause all kinds of mischief. What do you mean "because of the way you live?" The campaign didn't tell you? I told them we were a little different out here, so to speak. Yeah, you see, Evantide is an old abandoned coal mining town, but years ago, I rebuilt it as a sanctuary for people looking for a new way of life, yeah. An escape from the rat race, so to speak. Well, things are a little different out here. You see, we operate at night and we're trying to build a new society, but then again, Evantide is not for everybody, but we all would love if you became a part of it. - Hell no. - Uhh... What she means is that we really appreciate the invite, but, uh, I think we have to be getting back to Chicago. Well, dinner is about to be served soon, so at least can you be our guests of honor? Just one second. We need to get out of here now. I know we need to get out of here, but how, the tires are slashed... I'm not eating these white peoples' food, I'll tell you... Well, we know we're not eating these white peoples' food, okay. You've got ten minutes, Marcus, you'd better get me out of here. Be cool and sit down. Sit down. - I hate that goddamn fiddle. - Okay. Oooohhh. Dinner is served. Who would like to do the honor? - Come on. - Mm-mm. I'll give it a go! My daddy taught me how to slice up a pig real good. Thank you. Wow, this thing's old. Shit! A lot sharper than I thought. Hey! Get her a bandage. Ellie, manners, please. Ah! - Oh my God! Oh my God! - Ahhh! Go, go, go, go! Go, get 'em! But don't eat your dark meat! Gonna save that for later. This way! Aah! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, what are we gonna do?! Oh my God. Get to the woods. Oh! Ahh, oh my God! - You better back up, bitch! - Ah! AHH! Ahhhh! Ah! Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Go, go, Shanita, go. Shanita! Marcus? Get off of me, you get off of me! - Oh, oh! - Shhhh, shhhh, relax! Where are we? Away. Those people had... Vampires, yes, ma'am, blood sucking vampires. Oh my God, I think they just killed my husband. No, no, no, they haven't killed your husband yet. They ain't gonna eat him 'til high moon. High noon? High moon... high moon, it's like a blood moon and it's a special time for Arabus, he real weird like that. It's like when the blood moon gets to its highest peak, that's when they feast on they chosen sacrifice. They was the one that was able to send y'all to be here. You mean me and Marcus? Yes, you and Marcus, y'all are like turkey on Thanksgiving dinner, and they love dark meat. Why haven't they eaten you? You're big and dark and meaty. I've saved your life and you come at me with the fat jokes. Big and dark. God damn white people! Look, look, wait, wait, stop, I can't talk with these damn things in my mouth. Ah, ah. I am not gonna hurt you, all right? I'm like a vegan in the vampire world, I eat birds and squirrels and shit. You eat birds and squirrels and shit? I eat lots of birds and squirrels and shit. Man, look, when these crazy ass vampires came to town, I thought they was a crazy cult. Then one of them motherfuckers bit me, man, and then they turned me so fast they wasn't able to eat me, and Arabus was pissed, he was pissed. Didn't you see my signs in the post office? - That was you? - Yeah, that was me. They took 'em down a few years ago when he was so-called "rebuilding," but I put 'em back up so I can save other people from getting ate. Why don't you just leave? I tried to leave, but every time I leave, Arabus always drags me back. Oh, my God. So you're a slave, you're a slave... First of all, I ain't no slave, I'm enslaved, there's a difference. And that ain' me, anyway. What's up with that fiddle, the Goddamn fiddle. Man, that's just a power kick, man, I mean, Arabus used that to show off that he in charge, it's like a school bell, I hate that damn thing. Fuck, me too. All right, we can't stay here, we gotta go 'cause when they get done with their feast, they comin' after us. Now, I can't escape 'cause I can't run during the day, but you should be all right. And you're sure Marcus is alive? Yes, ma'am, he's at the town center and they're waiting to eat him. Let's go. Are you crazy?! I am not leaving my man. I figured they'd have guns, but this is the jackpot. Well, I'll let you know, guns can't kill us, but they can slow us down. That's all I need. You know how to use these things? Two tours in Afghanistan. I'd better. Look, you just point and squeeze. Point and squeeze, point and squeeze. All right, let's Buffy the fuck up. Agghhhh! Hey, y'all! Behind you! Oh, yeah! Go girl! Damn! Nita. Nita, wake up. Oh, you have no idea how happy I am to see you. God damn it, your breath fucking stinks, just kill me. Oh, draining you will be such a delight. Listen, tonight, many were lost so we have to redouble our efforts to grow my beautiful family, but we also added to our numbers, and we... Ahh! Ahh! Ugh. You better back the fuck up, I don't care how young you are, I will take your racist ass. You okay, baby? Ahh! Now, where were we? Fuck! What you doing? Nita... Nita! Ahh! You Black bitch. Ahhhh! Who's the bitch now? You stinking mouth fake Bram Stoker white Dracula! I was about to have a date night with Marcus! Yeaaaahhhh! Who wants some? Don't leave us here, please! Please! Please help us! We can't leave him here. No. I ain't gonna say it, Marcus. Nah, you earned that one. I told you so!
