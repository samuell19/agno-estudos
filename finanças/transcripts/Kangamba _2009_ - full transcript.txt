Presents A Film By Rogelio Paris 1983, Africa, People's Republic of Angola, Combat units of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) organized, trained, and supplied by the South African army operate in the Moxico province and increase their attacks against the Peoples Army for Angola's Liberation (FAPLA) loyal to the national government. Angola asks Cuba to increase military aid. In response to the request, Cuban troops are deployed in different regions across the vast African country, including a village named Cangamba. One of the most distant and difficult to reach spots in Angola's eastern heartland. Southern Angola, August 5 1983 How long can a man resist under constant bombing? Without any water, sleepless, the air infested with the stench from the corpses. Sieged by thousands of enemies, waiting for a final offensive. How long can a human being endure? Kangamba Luanda 5 months earlier Mayito, Mayito. Your friend, Lt. Colonel Lorenzo, needs you. Fuck you, man. I can't believe it, flying South when I was almost in Cuba. Lorenzo screwed me. And he says he's my friend. We're only two Cubans on board. A cameraman, known as Pepe el Loco. And me, but I'm in no mood for wackies. I've been fooling around with the landscape, the animals, and the vegetation, but now I'm fully-equipped, I have a hunch that something big is coming, I've got a good photo camera and a 16mm one. Come on, run! Get in line! Cangama, a village built by the Portuguese. Scarcely 8000 people, including those in the quimbos. A FAPLA brigade and a small group of Cuban advisors. Mainly reservists like me. One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two; I just met with the FAPLA, Captain Lino and I agree on the whole issue. Obviously, Savimbi thinks that in this forsaken spot, he can count on the safety of the South African rear guard, to establish his so called Black Republic. You can see it in the way his troops are moving. Excuse me, Lt. Colonel. Meanwhile, what happens? Meanwhile, we'll dig holes, engineer. That's why I sent for you. You'll have to help Rogelio. You, with the camera, don't take one more picture, unless I say so. Right! You should be more careful with your kid. I'm looking for Joao. -That's me. I'm Captain Mario. Glad to meet you, Captain. I need to speak with you, primo. I'm in trouble, primo. -You can tell me, Captain. I need full discretion. No problem, Captain. I'm with...you know... You know what. What is it, comrade? -That! Please, Joao. Where are you sick? Right here, damn it! There it is. -I'm out. You didn't get it? You can have it! One. This is yours. Blank. -What's going on? No, I'm out. No, I don't carry any. Four. Lions, don't go near people just for nothing. They need to be hungry. There's Lino, stop! What happened last night was an alert, Lino. They're getting ready to move with their artillery. Primo. they want to bury us here. We, in the FAPLA know it. Right. Good work, Captain. This comes from the North! They fucking started again! Get over there! Quick! Run over here, asshole! Hurry, damn it! Calm down! What's wrong? I sent for you because I'm in trouble. We ran out of gas. -Should I bring the tanker? Calm down, everything's going to be fine. Training the troop isn't that bad. The worst part is the 40 degree heat! On the other hand, at night, it gets freezing cold. Artemiso and Sobrado are like father and son. They're always working to make us feel better. First, it was a garden. Now, it's an oven to bake bread. We have to rush it, Rogelio. We need shelter for the people, and the engines. I got a radio from Luena, they can't reach us by land. We depend on the aviation. We can't push them any harder. They're working too hard. We've got no choice. To what do we owe the Chief's presence? I was remembering the battle where you got that shitty wound. It was a fucking ugly sight. But the devil looks after his own. That's why you're alive. You tell me, brother, why did you send for me just when I was leaving for Cuba? I got orders, Mayito. -Fuck me, man! I've known you for ages and we've shared a few missions. You wanna hear the truth? Shit, there I was thinking you were my friend. I need you, Mayito. Things are getting rough. My men don't know anything like this. You know, we can do this if we dig deep enough. We gotta help Rogelio. He can't do it on his own. Mayito, they're scheming something big. Get to the point, Lorenzo. We'll have to bury ourselves like moles. Before they do it for us! Captain, I don't like to mind anybody's business. I guess you don't know because nobody mentioned it. Lorenzo, too, should've left for Cuba, yet, here's still here. Move quietly. We'll snatch the quimbo from the FAPLA. Fire! Turn yourselves in! We won't! This is our quimbo and we're going to keep it. Our people want peace to grow their crops and live. If you join us we'll give you a lot of money. I owe you one, doc. Are you feeling better? Man, it was a rocket that you put in that shot. You gotta be careful with women, Captain. Speaking of women, what's her name? Long live, Angola! -Long live! Maria. Long live Agostinho Neto! -Long live! Long live President Dos Santos! -Long live! Tell me about your defences, Primo. The FAPLA is in charge of the northern defense ring. Our firing lines, mortars, everything, including heavy machines guns, are fortified. But I worry about the people. They don't see why they need to dig shelters to protect themselves from the artillery fire. They can't see why a shelter's better than hiding in the jungle. How about the Soba, primo? The Soba's working with us. -That's good! Sobrado, get more logs inside this shit, it's not hot enough. Holy shit, that's something! We're on television again! People only come here when they're hungry. Francisco and the chief have been my pals for a long time and they never stop by. Maybe they figure I went back to my hometown. Where's that, Artemiso? -In Artemisa, can't you tell? Let's try to get this batch out. Keep working. Come on, guys, hurry! Put on your shirts and wear them right, we can't look like a wreck, before the camera. Come on, speed it up! Move! Artemiso. How are you? I have some vegetables for your school. Thank you, Artemiso. When it comes to flowers, I can tell you for sure they might be like a treasure but here in Cangamba, man, they grow better for you. Movie maker! Don't you want to take good shots? -Yes, of course! Join us. They've been harassing us with mortars for months and in the last few days they're bringing them closer, I promised Lorenzo to find them. I'll bring Primo and Loco to train them. Let's go! Unita Territory You can get it but you won't get out. Savimba's Territory I've seen this before. I don't need another crappy wound. What did you bring? -Supplies and mail. Shit, at last. Mortar! -Get away from the plane! Run for the trenches, before they fucking kill us! Fire! Pepe! Hold it right there! Fire! Damn it! Keep crying and you'll end up alone in this jungle. Aren't you a soldier? Then get back there, shit, beat it! Battery 1, hold your fire! Battery 4, cease fire! Battery 3, cease fire! Battery officers! We change our positions in 15 minutes. I can't do it, Captain. They won't be screwing us anymore today. Get moving. I miss a good cup of coffee, damn it! Why don't you try drinking tangerine tea? I don't go for that stuff! Did you see anything? -We found their mortars. Clearly that's just a fraction of what they have, because they're blasting us from everywhere. How did the men behave? -FAPLA soldiers did fine. Guess who almost shits on... Did he freak out? -No... Mayito, don't forget he's just a kid. He's got no experience. -I didn't say anything. I'll go check that first batch. I hope its better than yesterday. July Primo! What's that, brother? Let me have it. Watch me do it. You see? Primo, don't worry, you're doing great. That's it, partner. Keep at it, you can do it. Come on, guys! We gotta hurry! The Soba and Lino, as chief of the regiment made them see that either we bury ourselves or they'll do it. I was speaking with Luena. Carry on Rogelio. Including Mayito's area we have 1.14 miles with trenches and shelters. 0.55 miles in the defense ring and 0.19 for communication trenches. That's not enough! -We have to keep digging. Listen, Lorenzo... Don't you celebrate any birthdays around here? If you like, we'd invent you one. Francisco, why don't we make some tangerine tea. and hand it out to the men? Mayito can drink all he wants. Seriously, Lt. Colonel. I think we should let them have their share of rum. Right! Naturally, those on duty will get their fill tomorrow. When are you on duty? Today or tomorrow? -Any time you say, chief. You'll just have to be on duty today. I mean to have my share of booze now. Joao, have a drink with me. I can't, Captain. Why not? -Because I'm on duty! I know it, but back in Cuba, when I ask my buddy to have a drink with me, he can't turn me down. That drink is, because you're my brother. I know you'll go to Cuba and become a hell of a doctor. Captain, don't play with that! When will you ever be serious with me? Joao, I might be a screwball and everything, but... I'm telling you this from the bottom of my heart. Attention! Soldier, let me see your canteen. Don't you know that your share is one-seventh litre, just like everyone else? Where did you get so much rum? How long have you been here in Cangama? A few months, right? You shouldn't steal rum from your comrades. You deserve a black mark on your record. This better be the last time. Carry on. Joao? -Who wants him? Captain Mario. Good morning, Captain. -Good morning, Maria. Come in. Sit down. Where can I find Joao and Captain Lino? They went to the quimbo but should be here any time. This is tangerine tea. I like tangerine tea. Any sugar? How about your kids? -My kids? They're good. Mind if I smoke? -No problem. How's the digging going? -Great! Here is Joao! Wait for me over there. I went looking for you in the hospital. They needed me in the quimbos. After you eat with your wife, see me in the green house. I'll meet you there. Drive on. Joao. -I'm starving, Maria! Why did you say that to the Captain? What? -That I'm your wife. Because he says you're hot. -I'm hot? I don't understand. -He means you're really pretty. Joao, no one in this quimbo calls me that. That's funny! I think you're jealous! You're my sister! My brother's jealous! -The Captain likes to play! Don't pay any attention to his games. Run to the trenches, now! Come on! Hurry! Run, damn it! Get inside the trenches! Nobody shoots until I say so! Fire! Base, here 00. Base, here 00. We got here on time. The first ring is still under FAPLA control. Ever since this morning report, they've been shooting us. It's been going on all day long. Roger. They're blasting us with all they have. This time is for real. The MIGs saved our day. Roger and out. This afternoon was confirmed that after a hard struggle UNITAs forces headed by Jonas Savimbi captured Cangamba, striking a final blow to Cuban and MPLA forces, usurpers of the power in Angola. Have some booze, engineer. That was a close call today. Rogelio, do you know Maria, Joao's wife? Joao's not married. Maria is his sister. August 3rd. Attention everybody! City of Havana, Cuba. Positive. The Head Staff's confirmed the information from Luanda. Starting at 5:55 hours on August 2. UNITA launched an artillery attack against the positions of the 32nd FAPLA Brigade and a team of Cuban advisors in Cangamba. August 3rd Of course! UNITA is singing happy birthday to their boss. Today is Dr. Savimbi's 49th birthday. I'm leaving for Angola right now. I'm scared too, many of my people are dead and can't speak their mind. I spent all my life with them, and now I feel empty. that's all I have left. From now on, I'll just have to speak with corpses, If God grants me the privilege. I'm on my own. My two children were killed by the bombs. Don't say that. We're not alone. I do think we are. You're out leader, get us out of here. Can't you see a way out? -No. Now the leader if Captain Lino. I can't do for the people, more than I'm doing now. I thought we might run away, but those who go to the jungle bring back the same answer. They're everywhere. After we meet with the FAPLA Head Staff, we're going to the tanks unit. They have a job to do. According to the information we have, 50 men are on their way here to reinforce us. The aircraft's ready to accomplish mission. 00. Here Tigre. All Melons are in the air. Your mission is to back their landing. 01, 01. They're shooting from the hill. 00. Here H-1 We're less than 10 minutes from the target. 00. Here H1. We're seeing the target. Starting maneuver. 00 to 01, 00, to 01. Get ready to fire. Come on! Come on! Let's go! Run to the trenches! Go on! Move on! Come on! Move, we're almost there! Did you bring new instruction? I'm taking over command. -How's that? Here's the order. Unita Headquarters I don't understand, this doesn't say anything. It looks like you don't think I'm doing right. This can't last forever, it has to end now! We informed the press we'd captured the village. If so, why are we still fighting? But you landed here. Who took this landing strip? We are everywhere. South Africa's given us weapons we never dreamed and we gave them to you. What for? The white men are pushing us. Thanks to them we're here. You have 3000 men and more than 60 artillery pieces. Occupy means occupy, General! Height 310! Shift right 050! -To the right 050! Battery! -Battery! Fire! Fire! Lord have mercy! My God! August 5 Fire! -Fire! Don't move, damn it, everything's ok. What's wrong, Reiner? -Don't touch your face! What happened? Come on! Come on! Leave it damn it! You need a doctor! Keep still. Take it easy, primo I can deal with this! Tuna, shit, don't touch your face! INITA's just taken over the quimbo and the river. Our only water supply. Lorenzo! They killed Sobrado. President Dos Santos ordered to transfer to Menongue 2000 C-5 rockets sent to Havana. This afternoon I'm flying to Luena. To meet personally the crews flying in the helicopters to reinforce Cangamba. Excuse me. Get me the tanks column in Menongue. Now! Reinforcement column Menongue. In hardly 48 hours, FAPLA and Cubans have two columns on their way to Cangamba. The fucking trenches behind the FAPLA house, crumbled. We have to build them again. Get to work! Hi Maria! I have to leave now, Mario. I'm going to the jungle with my people. Reinforcement column-HUAMBO. Comrade Officers! Comrades, we have an urgent message. The Commander is arriving. Go ahead 29. Are you crazy? Why don't you shoot? We're out of supplies, Captain! Where are your feeders? -We don't have any! We're pulling out! We're pulling out! Base, here 00! Based, here 00! The enemy lines are blurred. We can't focus the targets. Attention! We're attacking separately! We're attacking separately! Verde! UNITA is closing in on us. The aviation's firing their rockets but it's not being effective. Colonel! I said, that the aviations shot lots of rockets, with poor results. The worst part is that FAPLA troops lost the river yesterday. It was our only water reserve. We'll see what we can do. Roger and out. Manuel! -Yes, sir! Tell Ruben to contact with 00. I need a prompter in Cangamba. The aviation is firing blind. They need to get sharper; the enemy is too close. If the doctor goes with them, it'd be much better. Permission! Cheer up! Come on! Come on! When they run out of supplies, Captain Lino and his men, after repelling more than once the enemy infantry are forced to retreat into our positions no larger than a football field. The town is left at the mercy of the UNITA. Things look bad for us, but we know that Fidel, in person, minute by minute overseas the operations. Banana stumps and toothpaste, that's all we have to quench the thirst. Damn it, I'm going out! -You can't go back there! What the fuck's the matter. Just lie down there. Listen, I can still shoot! The winking eye, is already winked! That's nothing, but now you need to lie down. Come on! Get inside. Today the choppers had a hard time. They have to drop a Special Force company behind UNITAs lines and bring the doctor and the prompter. Going down! Henry! Guess what? I see two targets coming in from the south. Judging from their speed I'd say they're two Mirage. Headquarters! We see 2 mirage crafts, coming in from the south. Attention, 01, attention 02, here 00. Make sure the doctor and the prompter get to Cangamba. Roger 00. 00 here Tiger. Detecting two Mirage, zone 4, heading north. Tell me if you copy! -Here 00, roger. We're going into air-air combat option. Negative 00. Abort mission, abort mission! The order is to come home. It's an order! HO, HO, here Tigre The path road for the 21's is blocked. Carry out the mission on your own. Fire! Fire! Fire! Doc, hurry! Our radars detected two enemy planes. But beneath them were 14 South African Mirages. Is everything clear? Permission, chief. It's about time you got here, damn it. You two are crucial for this troop. You want some? -No, thanks. We need to make sure the aviation is effective. On the other hand, we must take care of the wounded. We'll take you to the medical post and there you'll meet two sanitarians who've been our life-savers. I brought a few medicines and some instruments I know it isn't much but we're going to need it. Right, Julio, take him over there. Check what you need to contact with the aviation. First, I need our positions. Francisco, show him. When their aviation comes back use the rockets. we've got plenty of them, when they come down we'll fire at them with our cannons. All the chiefs of units are waiting for their meeting with you. Order the officers in charge of the artillery units to return to the positions and open fire. Tomorrow we're going to hit hard with three battalions, and I want them to sleep tonight. The rest can wait. I'll see that your orders are carried out, General. Have dinner with me. -Fine. They should worry, they can't take the damn village. Home Front UNITA August 8 General, inform all chiefs of units to start the artillery fight and don't stop until I say so. Doctor! He's alive! Help. shit. quick! Careful with the leg! -Take the log off him. Careful with the leg, damn it! -Take is easy! Hold on, doc! Careful! Go ahead! Be quiet! I think it's the artery! Press hard, shit! Leave me alone, Reinier! Take care of Moro, damn it! Give me a fucking gun! They won't get me alive. Hey, Reiner, damn it! It's us! Let me go! -Fuck! It's me, Francisco! Fuck, the doctor! UNITA troops are less than 0.037 miles away from us, making it very difficult for the MIGs to make fire. 00 here Pilot. Here 00 Pilot. Pilot, I'm copying you, answer. 00, here Pilot. 00 here Pilot. -Go ahead Pilot. Inside the church tower they have a sniper who's been giving us hell. Attack him on combat course 720. Combat course 720. Roger, going to that position. UNITA! Fire! -Fire! Let me go, damn it! -No, chief, don't! You know you can't go out there! Don't let them cross! Shoot! Shoot, damn it! Watch out! Shit! Shoot! Shoot! damn it! Don't let them come near! Shoot! Give me room! Give me room! Hey, shoot! Fire! Don't stop! Fire! Son of a bitch, get it! Fire! August 9 Add to the third column a battery with 85 and 37 mm cannons. Talk about it with Ulloa, but you have to move fast. If you appoint Andres in charge, it'd be even better. OK, move. General! Good news, the General Staff guarantees that today, two Special Destination Companies will be arriving here to increase the troops fighting behind UNITAs home front. I guess it's time. Let's wait until it stops raining. It never stops. Anyway, let's wait. Where are we going to bury him? Right here. 00,00. 00,00 from a warehouse in the north side of the village we're getting hit with mortar 82. Roger. I'll deal with it. Shit, I failed, damn it! Take it easy 00. Take it easy. You can blast the fucking warehouse. I'm afraid I might hit you. -No, no, no. Don't worry about us, we're inside the trenches. Go ahead, shoot! Shit, I missed again! If I miss again, I'll impact myself against the warehouse! Colorado, look after my wife and kids. You just hit it, damn it! Permission. -Come in Manuel. Two things before I leave. First, Special Destination troops will keep fighting behind UNITA's rearguard. Don't even try to break the siege. Those are orders from Havana. Two. The communique sent by the Commander in Chief must reach the troops at any price. Can we get through to Cangamba? Yesterday we spoke with Lt. Colonel Lorenzo. So? -Seventeen Cubans dead, as well as many FAPLA. But they're holding on, General. What about water, food and supplies? They don't mention it. Four days without water and they're holding on. Get moving! Special Destination troops place mines in UNITA's rearguard. Meanwhile, the tanks keep moving ahead. Kid, where you want me to drop the candies? Got you, I have you in sight. I can see your blasts. Tell me where you want me to drop the candies. On top of the blue house, Fatso. Put on your party hats. I'm ready to crash the pinata. Very soon we'll be the ones inside the circle, we should view the possibility to abort the operation. The aviation is blasting us very hard. We received a letter from the Commander in Chief. Is it for everybody? -For everybody. To all Cubans and the 32nd FAPLA Brigade fighting in Cangamba. Dear comrades: For days we've followed by the hour, your heroic resistance against very superior forces in number and means as South Africa's puppets in Cangamba. If the enemy takes Cangamba they will be ruthless with the wounded and the prisoners. Inside your positions, well entrenched, with calmness, self-confidence and total determination you must repel all enemy attacks, endure the artillery fire and destroy those who attempt to take over your positions. All Cuban means and forces will be used if necessary to free you from the enemy siege. Our troops will be there soon, in three or four days. But if the distance, the natural obstacles and the enemy actions delays them twice or thrice that time or even more, You must resist. Because they'll get there at any cost. Cangamba will be an everlasting symbol of the courage showed by Cubans and Angolans. Cangamba will serve as an example that the blood shed by Cuban and Angolan men for the sake of African's freedom and dignity, has not been in vain. I'm confident in your unbeatable courage and I promise that we'll rescue you at any cost. Motherland or Death! We shall overcome! Come on, Primo! It tastes like shit. But it is water. Run, damn it, hurry! Run, shit, quick! Start giving out the water, one cap each. And leave two canteens for the medical post. He's crazy! -He tells me he's fine. So! That's good. -Sure, after all the trouble. UNITA! I'll talk to him! -UNITA! Call everyone. Maria, come on! The struggle! -Continues! Victory! -Is sure! This silence means that anytime now, the enemy will launch their attack. Everybody knows what to expect if we fall in the hands of UNITA. If we're going to die we'll go fighting. Reference point 1. To the left 10. Reference point 1. To the left 10. Height 30. Fire! Fire! Fire! Order the weapons we've got left to go on shooting to guarantee the South African advisor's retreat. Fire! You're crazy, Captain! Take cover, damn it! -They're pulling back! They're pulling back! UNITA is pulling back! Long live Angola! -Long live! I like tangerines. And you wonder how we got this far. How did we survive when we saw ourselves almost dead. When will you understand? Life is an act of faith. Is to live beyond sadness And to grow in your dreams. Time won't wait. You just have to move on. To change all the fears That leave us sadness. And all that is worthless If one day withers. All the pride In your eyes. Love is all that matters. Love is all that matters. When will you understand?
