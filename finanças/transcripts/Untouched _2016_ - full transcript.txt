(dramatic suspenseful music) - [Woman] So, what are we going to do? - [Man] I can’t quit law school. (dramatic suspenseful music) (heartbeat) - [Woman] Forget it. (slow gentle piano music) (moves into slow gentle string and piano music) (moves into steady string music) (hatch creaks) (sizzling) (steady string music) - You’re qualified, thank them for the opportunity, don’t forget to say ma’am and thank you. (birds chirping) (doorbell rings) - May I help you? - Yes, I have an appointment with Ms. Thomas. - Oh, you must be Miss Haddad. - Yes, ma'am. - Come in! (laughs) - Helen, I’ll take it from here. You remember Bartlet. - Yes, we were just going over your resume for the 25th time. UNC undergrad, Duke Law School, Congressional Page, we only have one question. - Let me guess, the year off? - She’s good. - Keep your knees together, Bartlet - Volunteer work in Costa Rica, sir, ma’am. - A bleeding heart, very admirable. - Indeed. - I would be an asset to your firm. - What do you think, Bartlet? - Miss Haddad needs to be careful for what she wishes. - I think I agree with you, Miss Haddad. - Thank you, ma’am. - My late husband’s grandfather opened this firm. My son Mitch is a defense attorney here. So we're a family and I expect nothing less than excellence. - I would love to work criminal defense. - I’ll see to it that Mitch shows you around. (birds chirping) (footsteps) - Your coffee's cold. - Denny here? - He’s here too. - Okay. - Hm. (door slams) - Denny. - Let’s not force a bad excuse, and just begin. Look, we have witnesses that say that they have seen and heard your son bragging about stealing the letters off the front of the neighborhood sign. These letters are worth two grand, and now the sign says Wild Ron as opposed to Wild Heron. - These witnesses are useless, Denny. Testimony's hearsay. Why are we here? - Because the association is tired of this kid. This ain’t the first thing he’s ever done. He keeps throwin' bags of dog poop and lighting them on fire and throwing them on the front porch, which is real original. So he’s going to get a year probation, 250 hours of community service, and $2000 restitution to replace those letters. - Its two letters. - John. Look, we all do stupid stuff when we’re young, Denny. Help him find the letters, John. - I don’t know where they are. - What’s the matter with you? - Mitch, there’s something we need to tell you. - He’s just mad because I’m making him take more math this last year o' high school. - I’m never going to use physics, Dad. - You will when you get in to medicine. - I'm not going into medicine, I’m going to film school. - You guys don’t need a lawyer, y'all need a counselor. - I’ve got it under control. - You’re forcing him to go into medicine, Rob? - Maybe if you had children, Mitch. - Rob, Mitch just helped John out of an unfortunate situation. Let’s just all calm down, okay? - Tell you what, I’m gonna go to bed tonight and if I wake up in the mornin' and see that those letters have magically appeared on the sign, I will see what I can do about getting the association to drop the charges. But this is a one time offer. - [Elanor] Everything's gonna be alright. (sighs) - Hope you're right. Hi, Mitch, I want to thank you again for your help in there and let me apologize for Rob's behavior. It's just, everything's kinda crazy right now. We’re having marital problems and a tough time here, but thank you. - You wanted to see me? - I heard about your little tirade downstairs. - [Mitch] It was a difference of opinion, mother. - In front of the assistant DA and our latest hire. - Should I come back? - No, no, sometimes families have quarrels. - I’m gonna head out, bubye. - This is, Lauren Haddad. - Haddad, from Savannah? - Originally. - Where'd you go to school? - Saint Vincent’s? - I know a good joke about Saint Vincent’s. (inhales) (sighs) - I’d like you to take Lauren under your wing. - I have paperwork to finish. - Make sure it happens today, Mitch. - Coffee later? - That would be nice. - This way Ms. Haddad. - In other news, a sixteen year old female has been arrested in connection with a newborn found two nights ago in a Tybee Island dumpster. It is believed to have been abandoned shortly after birth. The Tybee police are not yet releasing the name of the female believed to be the mother. (slow emotional string music) (phone beeps) (slow emotional string music) - Pastor, this is Angela Hart, Jackie’s music teacher. I just saw the news. Yes, sir, she's my favorite student. (slow emotional string music) Please let me know if there’s anything I can do. (slow emotional string music) (phone beeps) (slow emotional string music) (cellphone vibrating) (cellphone beeps) - Guess what, my first major case since becoming DA has just landed on my desk. - Ah, that’s cool, what is it? - Capital murder. - Hmm, anyone I know? (door slams) (speaks in foreign language) - Oh sorry, honey, you’re mother is with a man in her office. I think he’s a priest. - Hm. - She’s called twice looking for you. Let me help you. - Oh, thanks Alex. - Got it. Good luck. - Where were you while all of this was going on? - I was at a deacon’s meeting, and they typically run late. - Who got her pregnant? - I don’t know. - Mitch, thank you for joining us. You remember Terry Turner. He’s an old childhood friend of mine. - Mr. Turner. - Its actually Reverend now, but back when we were growin' up. - And this is our newest protege, Lauren Haddad. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Terry’s daughter has been accused of murder. - Who do the police say she killed? - Her newborn. - Why do they think that? - The child's body was found in a dumpster behind her school. - (laughs) I’m assuming you didn’t know she was pregnant? - I didn’t know she was dating. - She a juvenile? - Mhmm. - We can get a plea. - I can’t accept that, I can’t let this get out. I've thrown myself in to God’s work thinkin' that this may help her out somehow. In the meantime, I've created a ministry that helps hundreds of people. (cellphone vibrating) I can’t let this derail that. (cellphone vibrating) - Well, you're not gonna get an acquittal in this town. Excuse me one sec. (cellphone beeps) Taylor, what’s up? - Yeah, I’m filin' papers on that drunk Burnett. You guys are handling that baby killer case, right? Preacher’s kid? - Yeah, it's gonna be a circus, preacher's here. What do you know? - The baby was in a trash bag. Girl was at the hospital. - Anything else? - Your girl Reece sopped it up like Pop’s biscuits and gravy. - She’s not my girl. Alright, later brother. - How dare you say that? - Reece is pumped about this one, Mom. Look, she must have somethin'. - There’s a lot at stake here, we have to shine. - He wants this to go away. - Like that's gonna happen in Savannah. - Well, I’m gonna go ahead and have to take off. Visitations. Please give me a call if you have any questions. Eleanor. - Thanks, Terry, I’ll be in touch. - [Terry] Very nice to meet you. - I’m not taking this one. - You will. - Do you think a plea might-- - Get Mitch on this case! Terry has a large congregation. There’s a larger picture here. - I understand. (gentle violin and guitar music) - Mitch! Hey, Mitch! - Yeah. - Did you hear? They caught that girl. - You know, CL, you frighten people. - Well good, I hope she gets the chair. - That's not very Christian. - Whoever represents her will be judged. Now you stay away from it, Mitch. Choose life, abortion's murder! Abortion's murder! Abortion is murder! - You know that guy? - Choose Life. Yeah, one of my first clients. Before he came to me his name was Bob Anders. - I almost forgot how crazy Savannah is. What if she didn’t do it? - Reece seems pretty gung-ho. - But arguing and getting your hands dirty-- - This is not a TV drama. I need some coffee. (upbeat steady guitar music) (Lauren sighs) (upbeat steady guitar music) Any coffee? - We’re not servin' breakfast, but I can go get you some. - The defendant has been formally charged and indicted. I believe we have a moral obligation to persecute heinous crimes like this. Therefore, I will be handling this case. That’s all for now. - I mean, how could you kill a baby? I hope she rots. - She’s real nice, kinda smart and musical. - I really don’t think she’d do that. - So what are we gonna do? - I can't quit law school. - Forget it. - Your coffee, sir. - Thank you. How’s your research? - The best. - Go back to the office, have CeeCee help you find some precedence on handling juveniles in Superior court. Think the DA's planning a show. I’m gonna call Terry. - Okay. See you later. - See you. Mr. Turner, it's Mitch Thomas. I'm gonna need to interview your daughter right away. I need to see her friends, teachers, anybody that can help us build a case. Soon as possible. Got it. (grill creaks) - You know this means you gotta go to Tybee, right? - How'd she get to the hospital? - She drove, I guess. - Thanks Pop. - Yeah. - Is her car is still there? - I’ll call Theresa, we’ll check it out. - She’s 16, maybe we can use rape. - Hey Mitch, I’m gonna be servin' Lola’s special this Saturday. You ought to stop by. - Yes sir. - So what you guys workin’ on? - Mitch is defending the girl that killed her baby. - Saw that on the news. Damn shame, I heard she’s a musician. You guys might have somethin' in common. Bet Ms. Eleanor wants you to win big on this one. - Did she push you into this? - See what you can dig up at the hospital. (soft percussive music) - Ooh, you here to arrest me, sugar? - What? - I’m Taylor Gant, I work for the attorneys representing Miss Turner. We need to speak to someone about the-- - Oh, you're a workin' man. Oh, now that was awful. So what can I do to help a fine brother like you? - Were you on duty that night? - Actually, Bud was on duty. There go that crazy white boy now. - Thanks. - Mhmm. Hey! Psst, psst, psst. You on Facebook? (steady suspenseful music) - Hey girl, what’s up? - This is my brother, he’s an investigator. - Hey, how’s it going? - Hey - So, did you work the other night when the Turner girl came in? - Yeah, I was here. - Do you remember anything? - Let’s see, she was pregnant, she was bleedin', nurse moved her up to the front. Doc found out she was lyin', so she turned on the faucets. - Who called the police? - The doc. - And what did she do? - Wouldn’t stop cryin’. - Can we see her car? - She said she drove herself, but ain't no car here. - Okay, well if you remember anything else, give me a call. - [Theresa] See ya, Bud. (steady suspenseful music) (cellphone vibrating) (cellphone beeps) (steady deep emotional music) (paper slaps ground) - You just do your job, it’ll be fine. - I going to meet 'em this afternoon. - Yes, I know, I’m going with you. - No. - Terry is an old friend. - Fine, don’t get in the way. - Jackie, these are your attorneys. Answer their questions. - Hey Jackie, I’m Mitch Thomas, this is my paralegal Alex and our associate, Lauren Haddad. - Maybe we should start with a prayer. - No offense, I’d like to take advantage of the time we have. So Jackie, can I get you a water or anything? - Its Jacquelyn. - Okay. Do you know why you’re here? - I murdered my baby. - So you did it? - I guess. - Dear Lord. Don’t say that. - Was there anyone else with you? The father perhaps? - There is no father. - Jackie, tell the truth! - Get him outta here now, mother. - [Terry] What do you mean? - [Mitch] You know what I mean. - Eleanor. - I think Mitch needs some time with Jackie, let’s step outside. (intense dramatic music) - Maybe you can talk to her. - Mm. (chair scrapes floor) Jacquelyn, honey. Are you regular? - Regular? - Monthly. - I don’t know how I got pregnant. - Oh. - Look, we’ve all made mistakes, okay? Let’s just start over. - Yes, sir. - Do you have any friends at school, anybody you hang out with? - I love Ms. Hart, she’s my friend. - Did anyone know you were pregnant? - Tommy. - Who's Tommy, is he the baby’s father? - I told you, there is no father. - Can we talk to Tommy? - He’s not the father! - Does Ms. Hart know Tommy? - Can I go now? - Wait, I’m not done. Jacquelyn! Jackie, you have to give me something. - She’s scared like a little bird. - Hey, I got a description of the car. You meet her yet? - Yeah. - Okay, I got Theresa running a make to see if we can get a match at Tybee. - Cool, alright thanks. (cellphone beeps) Alright, if anybody needs me, I will be at Savannah Blues. - Oh lord. (upbeat steady emotional music) ♫ See the town risin' just above the steeple ♫ Come alive on a Southern damn day (guitar music) (guitar feeds back) (crowd cheers) (crowd applauds) (crowd chatters) (upbeat steady emotional music) - Mitch, your Makers. - Thanks brother. - I didn’t know you played. - Like I said, open mic night. Oh hey, this is my friend Dodd. We've known each other since we were five. - [Dodd] We were gonna be the next Lennon and McCartney until he had to run away to law school. - Just dreams. - It's funny about dreams. Holding on to 'em can be the difference in a life spent livin' and one spent dyin'. - Well nice to meet you. - You a lawyer? - Yeah. - You workin' on that girl’s case? - Damn, this is a small town. - You finally comin' back to Tybee? - Hey, I just got a little place out there. - Alright, be right back. - So, is he a good lawyer? - I hear he’s a damn good lawyer, when he wants to be. - Does he have an issue with Tybee or? - Gonna have to ask him that. - What'd I miss? - Nothing. - [Dodd] I’ll see you. (upbeat steady emotional music) (moves into steady gentle guitar music) (horse hooves clicking) - So, maybe you’re right, maybe we shouldn’t be on this case. - You came all the way down here to tell me that? - No, no, I just-- - Because, sometimes it takes people a week to make that decision. - I just think you changed your mind awfully fast yesterday. - I’m allowed. - So, you’re afraid of the beach? Tybee? (steady gentle guitar music) - I’m meeting with the DA by the way. - Should I go with you? - No, it won’t be pretty. - Why do I get the feeling that you’re somehow not telling me something? - I’ll catch you up tomorrow, I promise. (steady gentle music) (moves into deep dramatic music) (harsh air rushing) (deep dramatic music) (moves into soft steady percussive music) (truck hisses) (soft steady percussive music) - Hey. - How are you? - So, how did you find this place? - It's one of my favorites. - Yeah? (sighs) Hey, why have you been avoiding my calls? - Let’s talk about Jacquelyn Turner. - Why, are you defending her? Are you defending her? (sighs) Mitch, is this personal? - (sighs) Gimme a break. - Are you trying to stand in my way? - It’s not about you, RJ. - Fine. I’ve submitted a motion to have her tried as an adult. - She’s 16. - Yeah well, She got pregnant, didn’t want pastor daddy to find out, so she murdered it. - You really think it's that simple? - Yes. Okay, I know her dad and your mom go way back. Did your mom push you into this case? - It's not about Elanor. - Mitch. Alright, fine. Because it's you, I'll give you 15 years in juvenile facility, out in seven for good behavior. - You haven’t even deposed a witness. - I’m being generous. I get a nice conviction and she stays out of big girl jail. - It's not a win, RJ. - Well, it's the best you’re going to get. Alright, you ask the pastor, no, better yet, ask your mother. I want this wrapped by tomorrow. Oh and I see you’re still wearing that old guitar string bracelet. Say no and I go for murder one. (emotional piano music) - Hi, Jacquelyn. (emotional piano music) How are you feeling? - I’m okay. - Have you had any other visitors? - Just my dad and my attorney. - Do you like your attorney? - I don’t think he can get me out of this. - You need to confide in him. - But I don’t know what happened. - I know you’re scared. - Yeah, (emotional piano music) but I don’t know how I got pregnant. - Remember what I’m always telling you. God doesn’t give us days without pain. - Strength to get through those days. (emotional piano music) (speaker beeps) - [Guard] Please wrap up your visits. (emotional piano music) - [Angela] They said I could give you this. (emotional piano music) - What is it? - I call it a love note. - Thank you. (emotional piano music) - Hey Susan, how are you? - Mr. Thomas and who you here to see? - Jacquelyn Turner, you need to see that? - No, I don't. (emotional piano music) Mhmm. Hey, I need Jacquelyn Turner. Oh. Okay thanks. (phone clicks on receiver) You can go on back, she’s already there. She just had a visitor. (footsteps) (door buzzes) (telephone rings) (steady emotional music) (moves into soft suspenseful percussive music) - So how you been doin'? (soft suspenseful percussive music) DA's offerin' us a deal. - A deal? - You’ll only have to go to jail for seven years, if you exhibit good behavior. - Seven years? I don’t understand. - If we lose at trial, you could be there a lot longer. - But I didn’t do it. - You don’t have to say that. - No really, I didn’t, I just know I didn’t. - Why don’t you to tell me what happened. (steady emotional music) - I had cramps. I started bleeding. I passed out. Woke up and there was a dead baby lying on the floor. I just assumed it was my fault. - I need to know where Tommy is? - I don’t know. - Jacquelyn, come on, seriously I need to kn-- - No really, he said he might leave town. - Where'd you get this? You didn’t have it the other day. - I wanna keep it. - They’re not going to let you keep it. (intense dramatic music) (papers slap counter) (bottle knocks counter) (glass knocks counter) (intense dramatic music) (cellphone beeps) (intense dramatic music) - [Lauren] What happened today? I thought you were gonna to catch me up. I’m grabbing-- (cellphone beeps) Mitch, Lauren again. Just waitin' for a call back from you. Ready to work, whenever you are, so, gimme a call back, I’m here. (cellphone beeps) (glass clinks) (intense dramatic music) (plates clinking) (intense dramatic music) - I like the song you wrote. - [Young Man] I wrote it for you. - [Young Woman] It's beautiful. When can I hear it again? - Funny you should ask. (cassette rattles) - I made something for you too. - [Young Man] What is it? - [Young Woman] Open it. I made it from your old guitar strings. - [Young Man] This is cool. - [Young Woman] Its my love note to you. (intense dramatic music) (gavel bangs loudly) (intense dramatic music) - [Lauren] Don’t return calls? - Must've fallen asleep early last night. - Reece emailed me the deal. I think a nice, long trial might be more beneficial. May I remind you that Terry has a large family and even larger congregation. - She’s my client. I’ll decide. - I’m not done with this conversation. - All rise. The Superior Court of Chatham County will please come to order. The honorable Rose Milton presiding. - Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Ms. James, before we get started, I understand we have a deal to propose. - Yes your honor. I’ve submitted the paperwork this morning. - Okay Mr. Thomas? Mr. Thomas. - Yes ma’am? - Do we have a deal? - No ma’am. - How do you plead? - Not guilty. - [Woman] What? - [Judge] Ms. James, bail? - Your honor, considering the heinous nature of the crime, we’re asking for 1.2 million dollars. (Mitch laughs) - All jokes aside, your honor, she's not a flight risk. - I’ve read the indictment. Bail is set at five hundred thousand. - Thank you. I’d also like to point out that Miss Turner is sixteen. She has no priors and no history of violence. We’d like to ask you to have her moved to the juvenile facility to await trial. - I object on the-- - Ms. James, I’ll allow it. You still get to try her as an adult, unless, of course, Mr. Thomas can come up with a reason why you can’t. Anything else? - No ma’am. - [Bailiff] All rise. - What are you doing? - Protecting my client. - I was trying to protect you. Mitch. (slow emotional music) (crowd chattering) (keys jingling) (crowd yelling) (slow emotional music) (car engine starts up) (car engine revs) (crowd yelling) (slow emotional music) (papers ruffling) (drawer handle clicks) - Hey, Mitch, you should come play at Savannah Blues this week. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, we’re sellin' it. We're gonna put more into this place. - Please, have a seat. Would you like something to drink? - Oh, yes, I’ll have a martini, but make mine with gin. (laptop whips through air) (slow emotional music) I’ve always respected you, Eleanor, but there are no more deals. - No, (laughs) that’s not why we're here. I wanna talk to you about Mitch. (slow emotional music) - But its over with us. (slow emotional music) Thank you. - I don’t wanna talk about that either. - Then what do you wanna talk about? (door slams) - You know, the firm used to own a lot of property around Savannah? Also out on Tybee. - And? - Some things are better left untouched. - I was just looking. - For something that tells you more about Mitch. - I’m terribly embarrassed. - Sometimes you have to be obvious. - He’s just being so secretive. - Sometimes you have to be less obvious. - Please don’t tell him that I was snooping. - I don’t have to tell him anything. - You know, I’ve always liked you, Reece. And I have a little story that I think you’d like to hear. - Well then, tell me more. (slow emotional music) (moves into steady deep emotional music) (moves into heavy guitar music) (cellphone vibrates) (liquor sloshes) - Taylor, what’s up? - [Taylor] Where you been? I’ve got some information you need to see. - Okay. - [Taylor] Pop’s in 30. (intense suspenseful music) - Hey, Pop. (intense suspenseful music) Yes? - You smell like a bar. - What’s with you? - I’m fine. (steady soft suspenseful music) - I got three license plates of Civics on Tybee. All of them are registered to women. No teens. (paper ruffles) (steady soft suspenseful music) Where’s he going? - Angela Hart’s name is on that list. - You think she’s involved? (steady soft suspenseful music) - Mitch, you already knew Angela was involved. - This car too. (steady suspenseful music) - Dumb coincidence? (Taylor laughs) Let’s go ask Pop. (steady suspenseful music) - He didn't say anything to me. I don't know what's happening. - Shall we talk about it, or not talk about it, or just? - I guess, I mean maybe Taylor-- - Hey, Pop. - Yeah. - That Civic out back, are you guys working on that? - No, that’s one of my kids. Boy named Tommy. - Tommy here? - No. Tommy hasn’t been around the last couple of days. He usually leaves it here when he’s workin' on it or somethin' like that. He leaves a lot of junk around here. - Let’s run a make on that tag, see if we can get an address. Thanks. Thanks Pop. - Thank you for letting me know. (phone clicks) Why is Steve Burnett in jail? - I’m not aware that-- - Have you seen Mitch? - I haven’t seen him since this morning, but I just heard Alex say he was on his way. (Elanor sighs) - Hey listen, I need to ask you a few questions about the Turner infant. Yeah, I'm defending. (intense suspenseful music) - Alright. - My name's Taylor Gant, I'm looking for a Tommy, do you know of a Tommy? - Is it possible that the infant, the baby was stillborn? (steady suspenseful music) In't it routine to check? (steady suspenseful music) - Hey. - Good game. - Good game. Hey, let's play another set. It's been a long day. - Now you serve. - Thanks. (steady suspenseful music) - What about toxicology? (steady suspenseful music) Can we test for everything? Awesome. Cool, Thanks. (steady suspenseful music) Alright, I’ll see you. Later. (cellphone beeps) (steady suspenseful music) (door slams) (steady suspenseful music) - Steve Burnett called Hogan and Malone to handle his defense. Feel better? - Actually yes. - He is one of our biggest clients. - He’s not important. - Every one of our clients is important. Don’t you let your personal problems ruin the reputation of this firm. - Me. I’m ruining the reputation? - Don’t you try and turn this around me. - You’ve gotten everything you’ve ever wanted, mother. - Except for you, Mitchell! Why don’t you just take your things and leave. (slow emotional music) I mean it. Get out! (slow emotional music) (door clicks) (paper ruffles) (slow emotional music) (phone rings) I don’t think this is necessary. - I found this. (slow emotional music) He loves you. (Elanor sighs) She’s going to set Mitch up. - The DA? - I don’t like the way this feels. (speaks in foreign language) Shit. What is she doing here? - Ms. Hart's a material witness. Right on time. Big surprise. Ms. Angela Hart, I think you know Mitch. (slow emotional music) Here, right this way. We'll be videotaping this for the record. (slow emotional music) (Reece sighs) So Mr. Thomas is defending Miss Turner and I need to determine whether or not she should be deposed. Ms. Hart. You are Miss Turner’s music teacher correct? - Yes. For four years. - Shouldn’t she consult a lawyer-- - What do you know about her personal life? - Not much. - Aren’t there confidentiality-- - Did you know if she had a boyfriend? - She never mentioned anyone by name. - Did she discuss sex with you? - Certainly not. (steady emotional music) - [Reece] Did you know she was pregnant? - I guessed. - And did she discuss keeping her baby? - I advised her to keep it. - And what was her response? - She was afraid of her father. You know how people in this town can be. - [Reece] Did she tell you what she was planning? Was she planning an abortion? - She wanted to keep the baby. - And did you tell Mr. Turner any of this? - No. (slow emotional music) - Your turn. (slow emotional music) - [Lauren] What kind of student is Jacquelyn? - She’s friendly, she listens, she helps tutor the younger students, she’s a great kid. I don’t believe she murdered her baby. - Was she your favorite? - Yes. - That’s all I have for now. - May I go? - Oh. What type of teenager would you consider yourself to be? - Excuse me? - Would you say that you were friendly, helpful and caring? - I try to be. - RJ, that’s enough. - Were you ever in Miss Turner’s situation? - Are you asking Angela if she’s ever been charged with murder? - No. Have you ever been pregnant? - Stop it! Don’t answer that. - Mitch, I’m establishing credibility. (steady emotional music) - Yes. - [Mitch] She’s told her story. - Not all of it. Why didn’t you keep your baby. Ms. Hart, please, answer the question. (steady emotional music) - Because-- - No! Stop it. Because her father was dying. Because her family was broke. Because I told her it was for the best. - And some would consider that murder. (steady emotional music) No further questions. (steady emotional music) - RJ. RJ. - I’m tired of coming in second, Mitch. - Mitch. (intense emotional music) (moves into acoustic guitar music) (moves into intense instrumental emotional music) - Dinner's ready. Here you are. - Thank you Lola. - You're welcome, let me know if you need anything else. (slow string music) - So, your parent’s are teachers? - My dad's not working right now. He’s very sick. - I’m so sorry to here that. Mitch tells me you live on Tybee. Yankees are buying up everything, rebuilding. In ten years, everything'll look completely different. - You know that Angela is helping to support her family. I’m sure you can appreciate that. - Yes, working in a bar? - Its a restaurant. - Oh, how nice. I’ve never worked in bar before. When I was growing up, men used to love to tell tales about Tybee and drinking and gambling on Sundays. But what they really liked to talk about was the infamous girls. - Mother! - Was that back when they had a trolley and kept slaves? - We never had slaves in Savannah dear. (steady emotional music) (moves into steady suspenseful music) - Taylor it's Mitch. - [Taylor] Hey man. - Did you get an address for Tommy? - [Taylor] Yeah, 1407 Jones. You sound hung over. - Yeah, I need one of Pop’s special little concoctions. - [Taylor] Alright, I’ll see you there. 20 minutes? - Alright. (steady soft suspenseful music) (seagulls whining) (crows squawking) - This is it. 1407. - You go 'round back. - Okay. (steady soft suspenseful music) (door clicks) (steady soft suspenseful music) (gun clicks) - The hell you doin' in here? - Ma’am I’m an attorney for-- - You got no business in here. - Your front door was open, I'm-- - That don’t mean nothin'. - Are you Tommy’s mother? - Yeah, I gave birth to the boy. - Do you know where he is? - No, he works, sleeps, does it again. - Keeps his room awfully clean. - Hmm, yeah well he oughta, he's got enough cleanin' shit. - You know where I can find him? - No. I ain't seen 'im for days. - Tell you what, If you put the gun down, I’ll be out o' your way. - Mhmm, you see you do. (door clicks) - You Tommy? (steady soft suspenseful music) You know Jacquelyn Turner? - Who the hell are you? - I’m her attorney. - Yeah, I know Jacquelyn Turner. So? - Well we need to ask you some questions. - Am I under arrest? - How you know Jacquelyn? - I’m a mechanic. She dropped her car off a few times. - She seems to think you guys were close. - She doesn’t seem like your type. - Well she ain’t? - But you had sex with her anyway. - What? Hell no. - Boy, are you in some kind of trouble? - Ma, I’m fine. It wasn’t me. - So you knew she was pregnant. - She had a baby, didn’t she? - You were there? - Quit twisting my words. - You said you knew she was pregnant. - Wait, what? No, we, I-- - Which is it Tommy? - Listen. - I can get the cops down here in three minutes. - What? I ain’t got any money come get you out. You better tell the man what he wants to hear. - Alright, alright, fine. There’s these guys. - Names. - Timmy, David Chase, Josh. They all go to Jacquelyn’s school. They get girls messed up at parties and they do stuff and put it on-line. They told me about it. - How’d Jacquelyn get involved with them? - She got bored and crashed one of their parties. She told me about it. I told her not to go. You can check it out. - We will. Have Jeff run this for DNA. Let’s make it urgent. - Okay. (glass clinks) (steady reflective music) - Ugh, thank you. Little more. Thanks. (glass clinks) (steady reflective music) I don’t see Jacquelyn anywhere. Are these the right boys? - Mama woulda skinned me alive. - Lola woulda skinned us both. (Taylor laughs) I don’t see Jacquelyn. - Yeah man, I don’t think Jackie’s in any of these pictures. (sighs) Look, I gotta go. We could be at this all night. I’ll get somebody on this, okay? Take it easy on that stuff alright? (steady reflective music) (doorbell rings) (Alex sniffs) - (speaks in a foreign language), Alex. - Good morning - You want a desk here too. - If it is a antique Georgia pine. - Hmm. - Taylor sent us an email. You must read it, come on. (clicks fingers) (door clicks) (glass clinks) Oh, gosh. (keyboard clicks) Gosh. - Tommy was right. (Mitch sighs) - She looks stoned. - What about Timmy, Kevin and David? Do you know them? - No. (paper slaps table) (Jacquelyn sighs) - Those are posted on-line on their web site. - Do you have to show these in court? (paper slams) - What happened? Were you drunk? Were you high? Were you-- - No! - Come on, Jacquelyn. - Well you know, I'll tell you, I think once we get this funding and everything and check with the accounts we should go ahead and start this youth project and everything. (car door slams) Its goin' be good. - I that'll be good. - I'm really excited about it. - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah. - Hey! - Mitch. - You're late. - Excuse me. I’m sorry, I thought we were supposed to meet here. - Why don’t start puttin' her needs in front of yours. - You know, your mother said you were a rebel, but if you touch me again, I’m going to draw you into courts that you never learned about in law school. You understand that? Your mother’s not here to protect you right now. - I don’t need her. - I'm okay. - I don't need her. Just be there for your daughter. She’s in jail you know. - Get back here right now. Eleanor’s gonna hear about this. (intense dramatic music) (moves into depressing bar music) - [Reece Voiceover] Why didn’t you keep your baby? - [Mitch Voiceover] I can't quit law school. - [Angela Voiceover] Don’t be here when I get back. (depressing bar music) (moves to suspenseful emotional music) (door clicks) (door slams) - You lost. - Lost what? (suspenseful emotional music) - I don’t want that firm and I don’t wanna marry Reece. - You’re drunk. Get out. (suspenseful emotional music) - What would it have cost you to let me love someone? - Is this still about that little tramp from Tybee? - Her name is Angela! - I proved that she didn’t love you. She took the money. - We didn’t give her much choice now did we? - I was trying to protect you. - No matter what the cost. - There is always a cost. - As long as you don’t have to pay it. - You think I didn’t pay? I have spent my whole adult life trying to protect you. I never dated. I never remarried-- - And I never asked you to give up a life. - I have been trying to protect this firm, this legacy and keep it alive for you. - I don’t care about those things. - Because you don’t want to grow up. - No. (suspenseful emotional music) I don’t want to grow to be you. - Mitchell! (suspenseful emotional music) (police sirens ring) (police radio chatters) - Sir, you know why you’re being stopped tonight? You were speeding and you swerved twice back there. Sir, have you been drinking tonight? (radio beeps) Seven seven five, nine five patrol. 10 four, I got a DUI. Out here on Trigg and Burnette. (suspenseful emotional music) (Officer mutters into radio) (suspenseful emotional music) (heartbeat) - Don’t be here when I get back. (heartbeat) (suspenseful emotional music) (car door slams) - [Mitch] (mumbles) I let her do it. - [Taylor] What are you talking about? - I let her do it, Taylor. I could have just-- - You have lost it, brother. Tell me why I should give a shit about this anymore. - I need a drink. - Turner had you fired. (Mitch sighs) - Just take me home. - You gonna get drunk there? - Maybe. - What is the matter with you? Do you wanna be disbarred? - It wouldn’t be the worst thing. (intense emotional music) - You know what? Find your own damn way home. Call me when you get your shit straight. (intense slow emotional music) - So, what? You're just gonna leave? What am I supposed to do with him? Taylor? Taylor! (intense slow emotional music) (car door clicks) - [Reece] Come on. (Mitch grunts) (car door slams) This is getting old. - It’s not that bad. Hey, remember that party we were at last year? (Reece laughs) Christmas party? Wow, look at you. You look great. - What’s gotten in to you. - The wine cellar? - Stop it. Where are your keys? (keys jingle) (slow steady emotional music) Come on. - You're comin' in right? (slow steady emotional music) (keys jingle) - Go to bed, Mitchy. (door clicks) (slow emotional music) (birds chirping) - (Speaks in foreign language), Alex. - This is because I love you, Mitch (hand slaps face) (Mitch grunts) - Alright. (Mitch grunts) (hand slaps arm) (hand slaps face) - And that’s because you get me angry. (slow emotional music) (liquid splatters) (slow emotional music) (speaks in a foreign language), Mitch. Its enough. - I guess you leave me now too. - Of course I’m leaving you. Shit. There’s a scared girl who needs you and you quit. - There’s nothin' more I can do. - There's a hearing scheduled tomorrow. Eleanor has worked out another deal with Reece. You can turn it all around. (steady emotional music) This whole place needs toxic chemicals. (Mitch laughs) - Toxic chemicals? - Yeah. (suspenseful emotional music) - Where’s my phone? - What? - Where’s my phone? - Your phone. (papers ruffle) (steady suspenseful music) - Got it. (steady suspenseful music) (cellphone beeps) (steady suspenseful music) Jeff, it’s Mitch. Results? Flunitrazepam, Rohypnol, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate. Are you sure? (steady suspenseful music) Thanks. (cellphone beeps) - What's all that? - That’s why Jacquelyn looked stoned. Get Taylor to go grill those boys, right away. - Okay, yeah. (steady suspenseful music) - Where’s my crescent wrench? Guys, where’s my crescent wrench? (metal clicks) (Pop laughs) You sweating it out. - Yes, sir. - Guys, go make sure that pick up's ready. (steady suspenseful music) D'you take that girl on because o' your mama? - No. - You shoulda done it bec-- - Pop, I need your help. Tommy's that baby’s father. - If I didn’t take you as one o' my own, I would jack you up, right now. (steady suspenseful music) - Hey listen, Pop’s biscuits are ready. I’m in. Come on over, I’ll see you in a minute. Bye. (steady reflective music) (trunk slams) - Pop. (breathing heavily) You startled me. - Packed like you’re goin somewhere. - Just going to see a buddy in Baxley. - Before you head out, wanna help me with somethin' real quick? - Yeah. Yeah. (steady suspenseful music) - That girl’s attorney, he stopped by again today lookin' for you. I wanted to knock him when he told me that you killed that girl’s baby. (steady suspenseful music) - That’s bullshit. - Yeah, well then he showed me some shit that I didn’t think anybody I knew could be involved in. (Tommy yelling) (steady suspenseful music) (handcuffs click) - This ain’t legal. - Let me refresh your memory. You’ve been usin' those cleaning chemicals to make date rape drugs. You sold 'em to all your friends on Tybee. You got her pregnant. - You can’t prove any of that. - Those three boys sold you out and we got your DNA from the house. - I dare you to call my bluff. - She was hidin’ from her daddy. She went in the bathroom and screamed. She had blood on her legs. What was I supposed to do? (steady suspenseful music) (moves into slow emotional music) My mama’s remedy for everything was castor oil. I told her it would help her with her cramps. She drank the whole damn bottle. (steady emotional music) I went and got her a Coke and it musta done somethin', ‘cause when I came back, she had broke open. The whole floor was wet. (steady emotional music) Jacquelyn freaked out and she ran into the bathroom and I heard a horrible scream and then just nothin'. I kicked open the door and... she was layin' there out cold on the floor against the tub. I picked it up-- - You killed it. - It was dead okay, I promise, It was dead. It was dead! - Why did you dump it? Why did you dump it? - I couldn’t have her rich daddy on me my whole life. - Will that be enough for Reece? - I think she can make it stick. I'll take it from here boys. - I'm sorry. - You're under arrest. (steady emotional music) - What's gonna happen to Jacquelyn? - Explain it to RJ, juvenile misdemeanor. No jail time, no record. - I'm proud o' you. Is it all finished? - Yeah. It's all you now. (steady deep emotional music) (moves into harsh guitar music) (seagulls whining) (waves sloshing) - Please forgive me.
