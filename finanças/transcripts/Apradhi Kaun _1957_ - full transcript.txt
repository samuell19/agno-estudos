You Tube - Video Running Time 01:57:40 You Tube search name - Apradhi Kaun (HD) (1957) - Mala Sinha - Abhi Bhattacharya - Hit Bollywood Movie With Eng Subtitles Hello! Where's your boss? Why don't you answer me? Insolent! Listen! It's futile to get angry at him. He's deaf and dumb. What do you want? I want to meet Mr. Shrinath. He's in that room. But why do you want to meet him? I'll tell only to him. Misappropriation of Rs.10000! If it's not rectified within three days.. Then I'll not only sack you.. - But also put you in prison. - But sir.. Who are you? Why are you coming inside? Today, you didn't even recognize your elder brother, Shrinath. Brother Dinanath! You're stunned as if you've seen a ghost! - I had heard that you.. - That I am dead. There's just a small gap of only four fingers between the eyes and ears. What's heard is a lie.. And what's seen is the truth. Why are you still standing here? Go on! How long have you been having this? This has been my condition for the past two years. Why have you come here? Its not necessary that an elder brother should.. Have a reason for visiting his younger brother. I don't think you have come here without any reason. Monetary reasons have brought you here. That day you fought with father and left home. Landlords are evil. They exploit poor people! It's a sin to even live in the house of such a cruel man. Why, isn't it a sin to return to this house? Helplessness makes you forget virtues and sins, Shrinath. When a man fails to find a place in the world.. He takes shelter in his own house. His own house?! Brother Dinanath, don't forget that you have no right over this house. Father has even disinherited Pitambar! Because he got married in a low class family against his wish. Now this house belongs only to me. This inheritance is mine. Father has made me the sole heir in his will. But I had heard.. That in the final moments.. Father had prepared a new will to atone his mistakes. - New will deed? - Yes. In that, Pitambar and I were equally entitled.. To inherit the wealth and not you. So, you have come here to claim your right. Where is that will? Who has seen it? Who are the witnesses? I don't know all that. So, you're just making empty threats! If you want your right, then go to the court! It's always open! Shrinath! Why are you saying this, Shrinath? I'm a sick man. I might die at any time. Old and handicapped. My only desire.. Is to get a square meal for the rest of my days. It won't hurt you, if I live in some corner.. Of this huge house. Now, you've come to the point! But giving shelter to a man like you is nonetheless dangerous. What are you saying, Shrinath? Don't you remember? During childhood, you took advantage of the fact that we were identical.. And constantly humiliated me. Why are you digging up the past? What if you get greedy for inheritance? No, no, Shrinath! I wasn't interested in the wealth then.. And I'm not interested in it now. Alright, you can stay here. But remember.. I kill the enemy before he can strike! Manager! Manager! - Yes, sir. - Look, my brother will stay here. Make arrangement for his accommodation.. In the room adjacent to mine. Okay. And, listen, I'm going to the city in the evening. - Tell the driver to keep the car ready. - Alright. "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Decision of your and my heart is still to be taken." "Taking my heart.." "After loving you, the illusion broke." "Not to love people who flatter you." "After loving you, the illusion broke." "Not to love people who flatter you." "The heart won't hurt. This heart is better off alone." "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Decision of your and my heart is still to be taken." "Taking my heart.." "Don't sigh, it doesn't affect me." "I understand the glance. Don't make fake promises." "Don't sigh, it doesn't affect me." "I understand the glance. Don't make fake promises." "The heart won't hurt. Cast spell on others." "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Decision of your and my heart is still to be taken." "Taking my heart.." "Don't be fervent. It's my heart." "You can change. It's your heart." "Don't be fervent. It's my heart." "You can change. It's your heart." "Oh, heartbroken, don't break my heart." "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Where are you going, taking my heart?" "Decision of your and my heart is still to be taken." "Taking my heart.." Shrinath, you? Did you call me here? Yes. What's the matter that you called me here this way.. Through Lily rather than coming home? Method should be adopted to suit the situation, Mr. Rai Bahadur. I want the will that father gave you before dying. Why do you suddenly need that will? I should get the thing I've already paid for. I think, you no longer trust me. Maybe you are scared because Dinanath has suddenly returned. No need to get scared. Tell me. How much can you pay me for that? Why? Isn't the 20,000 I paid, enough? That was merely my fees to keep silent. Now that Dinanath has returned, the will's price has increased. To acquire an inheritance worth two million.. Dinanath can pay a few thousands himself. You are betraying me! You are cheating me! Do you know what will be the outcome of your deceit? For me or for you? I'll teach you a lesson that you'll never forget! Shrinath! No need to lose your control. If I want, I can make you a pauper! You're threatening me! Who do you think you are! - Let's decide right away! - Beware! What is this? What are you doing? - Lily, you don't know! - You don't know! Right now, Mr. Rai Bahadur is my guest. I have invited him. Its okay, Lily. - I, Jankinath, swear to avenge my humiliation! - Rai Bahadur! Please! Listen to me! He's gone! You didn't do the right thing! Now, you won't get the will. I'll get it by any means necessary. But how? How? Leave that to me. But, darling, you'll have to help me. - Sure. - Let's go. Honestly, I've had enough. I feel as if I'll faint. Is that so? You rest, darling. I'll leave. You've just arrived. You've hardly sit or had anything. - What's the hurry to leave? - I'm leaving today. - I'll come back tomorrow. - Will you surely come? Sure. Goodnight! I'm leaving. - Close the door. - Listen! Gone! As you wish! Goodnight! - It took you so long! - The job took long that's why I got late. This is the key to the safe. The back door is open. What about him? What's his condition? First, he was intoxicated. Now, he's unconsciousness. But take care. Be careful! - I know. - Good luck! Who is it? - Shrinath, you! - Yes! It's me, Shrinath! Give me the will, immediately! Give me the key. Give me. Manager! - Where were you? - Yes, sir! - Were you asleep? - Yes, sir! - It's quite late. - What's the time? - 2:30am! - Its 2:30am! - Call the nurse! - She took leave and has gone to the city. - She'll return tomorrow. - Why are you staring at me? Where's the doctor? Doctor! I'm feeling very nervous! - I'm feeling a strange terror! - Terror? Yes. As I was returning from the city.. I felt as if somebody was following me. - Somebody wants to kill me. - No, no. It must be your delusion. I'm troubled and you're talking about delusions! No need to worry. I'll just give you the injection. Injection! For the past two years, you've been.. Giving me injections and weakening my body! You stand around talking about an injection.. While someone comes and stab me! Manager.. I've heard about a private detective named Rajesh in the city. - Wire him to come over immediately. - Okay. - I'll pay him handsomely. - Okay, sir. Murder! Rai Bahadur Jankinath has been murdered! What a strange world! Murder for every trivial matter. People's life is no longer precious. Amazing! Excuse me, ma'am, whoever you are, come in. I want to meet Mr. Rajesh Kumar. That's obvious. If you didn't want to meet him, why would you come? Are you Mr. Rajesh Kumar? What's it to you. Tell me what do you want? - Was there a robbery, theft or a murder? - Murder! I think it's a murder case. Now look what happened last night. Rai Bahadur Jankinath was murdered. The police are searching for the culprit. But think what will the police do till we send them help? Do you have any name and whereabouts of your murderer? - My murderer? - Yes, yours! Tell me. Go on. - I think, I've come to the wrong place. - No! It's the right place. - Then maybe you are not in your senses! - That's not it. - I think it's not a murder case. It's a love affair. - Love! Yes! You've been unsuccessful in love! - And your lover is blackmailing you. - Stop your ranting! Claims to be a detective! You published the advertisement in the newspaper.. And you opened the office! If I had known this is the detective work that you learnt abroad.. Then I would've never come here! Good morning, sir! Sir, she's come to meet you. Tell me. What has brought you here? And you are? He's my boss. And I'm his slave, helper, employee and a servant. Meaning his assistant. But you just said that you are.. You misunderstood. - Did she make a mistake or you didn't tell her? - Yes, sir! Fool! Get out! Forgive me! Forgive me, ma'am! - I'm sorry for Balram's behaviour. - It's okay. - Mr. Rajesh, I've some urgent work with you. - Sit. Excuse me. Hello! This is Rajesh speaking. Tell me, inspector. Fingerprint report. But whose? Fine. Send the file immediately along with the Superintendent. I'll be there in half an hour. Is that fine? Thank you. Tell me. My name is Shobha. - I've come to make a request. - Tell me, how can I help you? You'll have to come with me. Where? Jeetpur? How did you know? You're forgetting that I'm a detective. My boss is not just a detective. He is also a psychic. Yes. Even if you don't tell him, still he can tell you.. About your past, present and future. - Idiot! - Yes, sir! - Get out! - Sorry. So what business do you have in Jeetpur? I'll tell you when we get there. No, you'll have to tell me here. Else, how will I know whether I can or can't do this work? You can surely do it. Look, there's a rule in my work. There's a method. If you don't want to tell me, then it will be very difficult for me. Listen! I'll tell you. Actually the thing is that I want to acquire something. You want to acquire something? Means, I want to seize something. You didn't understand? Say that I want to steal something. What? - Yes. - Then you have come to the wrong person. Wrong person? Aren't you Mr. Rajesh? I'm Rajesh. But I don't steal. I nab the thief. To steal something, you will have to go to a thief's den. - This is a detective's office. - Why are you distorting facts? Say clearly that you want more fees for this work. I'm not like the kind people who do everything for the sake of money. Don't waste my time. I've some urgent work. - Think once more. - I've decided. Fine. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Sorry, boss. But you had a tiff early in the morning too. What a strange girl! She's asking a detective to help her to steal. No matter, boss. The case was very interesting and beautiful too. If you had taken up the case, it would have been good, but you.. Sir, Jeetpur's affluent man Shrinath's life is in danger. He has called me immediately. Strange! That girl too had come from Jeetpur. I should go there. But the policemen said they saw.. A man with a girl, wearing our dress. But how did the police came here on the basis of the dress? Forget it! The police did not find out that I was there with you. But how did this get published in the evening newspaper? That the police have found a clue. And the murderer will be nabbed very soon. Must be the police's ruse. I think you've left your clue there. Anyway. Whatever happened was bad. Very bad! Had I known that you would commit murder.. I would have never helped you. Believe me, darling. I didn't commit the murder deliberately. Because of nervousness, anxiety.. Fear, something happened that.. Now, don't talk about it. Even the walls have ears. Stay alert! Don't come to meet me for a few days. Alright, darling. But if you receive any news from the police, call me immediately. I'll surely inform you. - Goodnight, darling! - Goodnight! I got late. You people have still not started. Carry on! Brother you can't use your right hand at all? No, Shrinath. Doctor did you check him? Yes. It's an old ailment. Seems to be incurable. Nonsense! Being a doctor, you are sounding so bleak. Research it! I've opened a laboratory for you. I've given you all the equipments. Still if brother can't be cured then what's the use? But Mr. Shrinath.. When the aliment is advanced then medicine doesn't work. No, no! That's not possible! Doctor, begin the treatment. Understand? Sir, detective Rajesh Nath has arrived from the city. Fine. Ask him to sit. Sir! That statue must be around 2000 years old! Its craftsmanship reveals that the craftsman.. Must be from China or Egypt. Balram.. It would have been better if you had left your brain at the office. I think you are Mr. Rajesh. Yes. Greetings. Greetings. Who's he? - He has come with me. - Please tell him to go out. Balram. Sorry, but I'm his assistant. - Go out. - Okay. I came as soon as I received your telegram. But the manager didn't tell me about the precise danger you are facing. I had written that my life is in danger. - Do you have any enemies? - Enemies? - No one I know. - Do you doubt anybody? In nervousness, a person doubts everybody. But I don't doubt any particular person. But what could be the reason of danger? I don't know. Why don't you find out, Mr. Rajesh? I've called you for my safety. - Sir. - What happened? - Your medicine. - Medicine? You can leave. Mr. Rajesh, I'm a bit tired. I'll leave for now. I'll talk to you in the morning. And, yes, I'll make arrangement for your stay here. Thank you. Don't worry. Goodnight. Mr. Rajesh, come. I'll show you your room. I'm sorry. The room is locked. You go ahead, I'll get the keys. You? I ask you the same question too. - I work here. - And I have been called here. - Who has called you? - Mr. Shrinath. - Why? - I think something fishy is going on. Mr. Shrinath's life is in danger. And you like to rob. Nurse! I'll meet you later! Sorry, Mr. Rajesh. You had to wait. Come with me. Which is Mr. Shrinath's room? - Second room from there. - What about the nurse? - What? - I'm a detective. I need to know everything. Why not? She lives in the adjacent room. Go and rest. And, yes, tell Balram that I'm staying in this room. Okay. Beware! If you move, I'll shoot! Look, I'm not lying! I have a pistol in my pocket. Tell me, what were you both scheming about? What? What ice cream? Not an ice cream! Scheme! I've caught you both red-handed! Tell me, what's your intention? But, who are you?! That you are bossing over us! Is that so? You're very innocent! Quietly accept your crime! Else, I'll get both of you hanged! Don't talk too much! Don't you know who I am! I don't know from where you've come from. Have the nerve to threaten me! Get lost! Let it be! Mind your tongue! Do you know who I am! I'll teach you both a lesson! You'll do that later! First, I'll teach you a lesson! Champa! What are you quarrelling about? Manager, hand them over to the police! God only knows, what they were gesturing about. - There's a secret hidden in their gestures. - They are both servants. She's the guard's daughter, Champa. And he's a deaf and dumb servant. Tell him, if I don't use sign language how will I talk to him! Why didn't you tell me that before? Forget it. Mr. Rajesh is in the upstairs room. Don't worry. Why will I worry? I've been born to worry others. Don't quarrel. Sorry, Miss Champa. Forgive me. I made a mistake. By the way, you are a nice girl. I'll give you an advice. Henceforth if you want to talk to anybody using gestures.. Then do it with me. My name is Mr. Balram. I'm staying in the adjacent room. Get lost! But I praise your hard work, doctor. I've never heard that an incurable disease like asthma.. Can be treated with just one injection. But great, you did it! I've achieved this success because of you. I want that the patent of your valuable cure.. Must be immediately registered. I don't mind. But on the condition is that we'll will be equal partners in the profit. Partner! You! You're my servant! I give you a salary. You give me a salary for your treatment and well-being. Not for invention. Wow! What are you talking about! You think that I left such a nice job for this salary and came here? No. You are here because.. I have made you my estate's trustee. I've opened a big laboratory for your experiments and splurged money. What's the use of the money and laboratory.. If I had not used my brain. I knew that your dedication and brain will work. It's good that I got hold of the duplicate copy of the.. Invention's formula in your absence. You betrayed me! You've crossed your limits! - Mind your language, doctor! - For your best interest.. Return the duplicate copy of the invention's formula! Otherwise what will you do? It's about my life and death for me. I'll do anything for it. Where's Mr. Shrinath? What? Tell me, what do you want? I have some work with him. Where is he? He must be in his room. Come. Mr. Rajesh! Inspector Sinha! You! Here? Mr. Shrinath has called me here for his protection. Sorry, Mr. Rajesh. I've come to interfere in your work. - What do you mean? - I've Mr. Shrinath's arrest warrant. Sir's arrest - For what? He's accused of murdering Rai Bahadur Jankinath. Where's his room? - Come! - Quickly! Mr. Shrinath! Open the door! Look! You both go and guard the backside of the room. Mr. Shrinath! Open the door! What's going on? Why have the police come? Mr. Shrinath! I say open the door! There's no answer. I think we'll have to break the door. As you say. - Look! - Wait. I have the duplicate key. Give it. You all stay away! Mr. Shrinath! Don't try to attack! Surrender to the police. Corpse! Mr. Shrinath! - Sir! - Switch on the lights! My brother! You all stay outside. You can't come inside. Let me check him. I'm a doctor. We'll call you if we need you. - Constable, nobody should enter the room. - Okay. You go out! Get out, you too! He was already facing a threat to his life. - And he had told me that somebody wants to kill him. - Who? The few words that I had with him reveals.. That he neither had any enemies nor he doubted anybody. But I didn't know that everything will happen so soon. I am dazed about where the murderer came from? And where he went. Let it be. I'll not rest in peace till the time I don't hand.. Over the culprit to the law. I'm warning you all. No person living in this bungalow.. Can leave without the police permission. It means you doubt us? - I mean to say.. - It is possible that you all are innocent. But it is the police's duty to investigate the matter thoroughly. I'll come here tomorrow morning to take everybody's statement. But before that, post mortem of the body is important. Ram Singh! Make arrangement to carry the corpse. You all can leave. I will shut this door. Inspector Sinha! - Don't lock the door. - Why? It's possible that the murderer has left behind a clue. - And he will come here again to erase that. - Well, not a bad idea. - Fine, Mr. Rajesh. - Okay. Who is it! You! What is the meaning of you being present here? To gain the thing that you have stolen. Before you are accused of hiding in a young girl's room.. Quietly, leave this place. Thanks for the advice. But stealing from the room where a murder has been committed.. Is not just a crime but it amounts to two crimes. Come on. Give me. But what will you do with this? How can I say without knowing what it is? What if it's an ordinary thing? So ordinary that you had come to seek my help in stealing it. And now putting your own life into danger, you've stolen it. At times, what's ordinary for one could be lifesaving for the other. And it also takes life. And it happened today. Believe me, this thing has no.. Connection to Mr. Shrinath's murder! I will believe that when I know what has been stolen. So look. Will! - Jogeshwar Prasad! - He was Mr. Shrinath's father. It means you know this family closely. Then the police will get sufficient help in nabbing the killer.. - With the aid of your statement. - No, no! I won't give any statement to the police! But don't consider me as the culprit! I'll you tell you everything. Thanks. Sit. Mr. Jogeshwar was a big landlord. He had three sons. Dinanath, Shrinath and Pitambar. Dinanath was a principled man. So he opposed the atrocities undertaken by the landlords. Pitambar got married to the girl of his choice. Using this opportunity, Shrinath instigated Mr. Jogeshwar.. To banish both of them. And he made Shrinath the sole heir. Before coming here, what Dinanath went through nobody knows. Pitambar left his wife and a small child behind and disappeared. There's still no news about him. Twice his wife came to seek Mr. Jogeshwar's help. But Shrinath didn't even let her meet him. And after some time.. she died. Mr. Jogeshwar always used to be sick. When he found out everything.. He made a new will before dying. He divided everything equally between Dinanath and Pitambar.. And he disinherited Shrinath. It's a coincidence that you got a job at the place.. From where you wanted to steal this will. - I want to ask you something. - Yes. - Where is Mr. Pitambar's daughter? - What? Who? What happened? Who was that? I am wondering the same thing. If there was somebody, where did he disappear? There was somebody. I even followed him. - But when I reached here, I saw he had disappeared. - Strange! I want to meet all the people living in this bungalow right now. Come, I'll show you the way. Come. This is Mr. Dinanath's room. Mr. Dinanath! What's happening in this house? He's fast asleep! Mr. Dinanath! - Who is it? - It's me! Rajesh. Open the door. I am sorry for troubling you. It's okay. Tell me. - Did you see anybody passing by the window? - Window? I was asleep. I don't know when I fell asleep thinking about Shrinath. What's the matter? Who was it? I don't know. But somebody was there. - He had worn a black blanket. - Black blanket? Yes. He ran away when he heard me. I even followed him. But when I reached the east wing balcony, I saw nobody there. Oh God! A man has turned evil! It's a dangerous thing! - Now what will happen? - Don't worry. I had only come to warn you. But whom to be careful about? You don't worry. We will handle what happens. - I will find out. - Surely. Constable! - Yes, sir! - Did you see anybody entering the bungalow? - No, sir. - Did anybody leave from here? No, sir. Fine, go. Come with me. You're still awake? Couldn't sleep? How can I sleep today? The sorrow of sir's departure.. Manager, Mr. Rajesh wants to know.. If have you seen any strange incident in this bungalow? What incident could be greater than this? That sir has been murdered! No, no! We mean to say ghosts. - Ghosts! - Yes. This bungalow is also known as a haunted house. - But many years ago, once.. - What did you see many years ago? A strange sight! I saw an apparition and it disappeared in a jiffy. Who used to reside here during that time? Sir, I and besides the doctor, all the servants. Doctor was there too? Yes, during that time, the doctor was here too. Fine. Now you can rest. Let's go, Ms. Shobha. I'm Rajesh. Please open the door. Sorry for troubling you at this hour. I had some work with you. Come in. It's so late in the night. You are still awake. You can see that. Is this all you wanted to know.. Or did you want to search the place too? You're misunderstanding me. I had a bad headache. So I thought you might give me some medicine. Headache and stomach ache occurs willingly. Doctors have to find out the truth. I'll give you this medicine. Have it with water. - Thank you. - If you have headache, it will be alleviated. And even if you don't have one, there won't be any side effect. You also want it? Me? Why me? At times the patient's sympathisers too fall ill. And you got the news of his aliment before the doctor. You're wrong. I didn't know your room. - So she.. - No need for any justifications, Mr. Rajesh. Goodnight. So you didn't see or hear anybody? Sir, I was sleeping. - So.. - People in this house are strange! - Boss has been murdered and everybody's resting! - Sorry. But there is no rest, sir! This deaf and dumb man snores the whole night. Yes, sir. This dumb man snores a lot. Do you understand? He's abusing! - Abusing? - Not you, me! - You understand his language? - I am trying. Fool! What will you understand? Go to sleep! Go. - You too go to sleep, old man. - What about you? His snores won't let me sleep! We met everybody. But we didn't find anything suspicious. - I did. - Where? - Everywhere. - What do you mean? - Why are you so anxious to know? - I'm not eager. But, I.. We will find out in the morning.. When the police will take everybody's statement. But why are you telling me this? Because it's quite late. Now you go and rest. I'll leave. If you feel scared at night, I'll stay here. I can even guard your door. Had I been such a coward then it would have been.. Difficult for me to stay in this place. This is what I thought too. You are very brave. - Return it to me. - What? This stolen stuff? - Yes. - Let it remain with me. But what will you do with this? - Tomorrow morning, in front of the police.. - You want to frame me? I only want to help the police. Goodnight. Can you tell me whether Mr. Shrinath had any enemies? He didn't have any enemies. - But.. - What? Nothing special. When I came here at that time Shrinath was threatening his manager. If he doesn't rectify the accounts.. Then he will land up in the prison. Last night, when I came how come you had Mr. Shrinath's room's key? At times, sir would return home late. So he himself had given me one set of keys. When was the last time that you saw Mr. Shrinath alive? At the night of the murder at around 11 o'clock.. I heard somebody quarrelling and I ran upstairs. I saw the doctor leaving sir's room in anger. - So because of this you both had a fight? - Yes. The person who had called you here, he is dead. Now, where will you go? The question of leaving doesn't arise. Because Shrinath has made me the trustee of his estate. Where are the documents of the trusteeship? It must be lying amongst his documents. Who do you think is the murderer? Law needs evidence, not conjecture. But when Shrinath has come, I had heard both the brothers talking. It clearly revealed that they shared a troubled relation. How long have you been working here? It has been more than a month. But late Shrinath was fine. Still why didn't you leave? Because, I was not told to leave. You may go. Wait! Inspector Sinha, if you permit, I would like to ask some questions. Go ahead. Ms. Shobha where were you before Mr. Shrinath was murdered? In my room. - And after the murder? - What? Yes. Where were you after the murder was committed? In my room. I was in my room. You may go. I'm still in the dark about this case as I was last night. Everybody is trying to blame somebody. You saw somebody last night. Found out anything about that? No, not yet. But I will be alert tonight. I am sending my report to the Superintendent of police. Will you come to the city? Yes. I'll have to go to the city too, to find out.. About the identity of this nurse. You go ahead. - I'll meet you at the police station. - Okay. - Can I come in? - Come. You didn't say anything against me in front of the police. I want to thank you for that. What is there to thank me? I did what I thought was right. You're going? You thought I had come here to stay? But it's not right to leave such a big case unfinished. Now the police are going to handle this case. And the person for whose protection I had come here he is dead. So why did you keep a watch on me at night? Force of habit. Why don't you think it's necessary to live here to finish that case? Because it's beneficial to you if I leave. - My benefit? - Yes. If I left, there won't be any hurdles for you. And you can steal whatever you want. Stop joking! Till we solve the mystery of the black shadow, stay here. Why are you so interested in me? Interested in you. I mean, I don't know. How much was Mr. Shrinath paying you? But, I.. I won't refuse to give you whatever I can. You know that I don't work just for money. If you say, I will stay here. - As it is, I was not leaving. - What? Yes. I was going to the city regarding this case. I'll return by evening. Bye. I forgot. Take your will. Keep it carefully. I'll keep it. But what if the black shadow comes back? I want him to come back. This is a bait to trap the victim. Meaning, you don't care about my life. I can even give my own life to save your life. But we have to lay a big trap for a big criminal. - You're very dangerous. - I'm not but I have to be. I'll leave now. - Did you call me, sir? - Yes. Look, I am going out. I'll return by nightfall. - You keep a close watch. - Pardon me! In your absence I will work so well that even you will be dazed. Fool! Keep a look-out! I do that. Miss Champa, here you are! - I was searching everywhere for you. - Why? What work do you have with me? - You see, my sir has gone to the city. - Oh God! It has gone to the city! Then what is this? Not my brain! My sir! My boss! Forget that! Champa, I don't know what spell you have cast on me. I'm telling the truth, Champa. I've lost my slumber ever since I saw you. What rubbish! - What if somebody heard you? - Who will hear us here? And so what if somebody heard? Boss has given me all the power before leaving for the city. I can get your lover that dumb man or anybody else hanged. - Why are you bullying me? - How can I bully you? I am your admirer, Ms. Champa. I am crazy about you. You are my beloved. "There are two lovers." "There are two lovers." "I and you." "And you too." "There are two lovers." "There are two lovers." "I and you." "And you too." "I know that you are kind." "I'm more innocent and pretty than you." "Your eyes reveal that your intentions are bad." "I know that you are kind." "I'm more innocent and pretty than you." "Your eyes reveal that your intentions are bad." "I look innocent." "I look innocent." "I and you." "And you too." "There are two lovers." - "I and you." - "And you too." "You too are great! I too am great!" "Then why to quarrel." "My eyes look at you." "I don't want anything else." "You too are great! I too am great!" "Then why to quarrel." "My eyes look at you." "I don't want anything else." "The man who looks at me." "I and you." "And you too." "There are two lovers." "I and you." "And you too." "My eyes have weaved many dreams." "Forget that, fool. Come back to reality." "My eyes have weaved many dreams." "Forget that, fool. Come back to reality." "It will take care of love." "It will take care of love." "I and you." "And you too." "There are two lovers." "There are two lovers." "I and you." "And you too." "And you too." - "And you too." - "And you too." - "And you too." - "And you too." If you had not found the other will of Mr. Jogeshwar.. Then it would have been difficult for us to know that Shrinath.. Murdered Rai Bahadur for this real will, Mr. Rajesh. Now, there is no doubt in this. That faking false danger.. It was his ruse to call me.. To Jeetpur in order to escape the police. You are right! But the amazing thing is that the fake danger.. Turned out to be real for him. And he was murdered before you could reach there. And in spite of your being present in the villa. This is amazing! I can think of only one thing. No matter, what is the reason? A person living in the villa has committed the murder. Doctor, manager, Dinanath or else the nurse. - Nurse! - Yes. Inspector Sinha, you are forgetting. The force with which he was stabbed.. That weak girl was not capable of doing that. If this is so, then we can even erase old and crippled.. Dinanath's name from the list of suspects. Fine. But how can you say that the culprit lives in that house? It's possible that some outsider has committed the murder. - Outsider? - Yes. Nobody knows anything about the youngest brother Pitambar. It's possible that to gain the wealth, under a disguise.. It means everybody is a suspect. And we don't have evidence against anybody. Inspector Sinha, tell me. Where to begin the work from? What do you think? I think we should begin the work with this handkerchief. - You mean, Lily? - Yes. She is declining everything. But she'll have to accept it. Because besides her, we don't have any other means to proceed. If this is the case, then we should arrest her. No. I think till the time I don't reach any conclusion about Lily.. The police needs to hold off. Because it's about a girl. No. Because it's about the murderer. "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "Why are you nervous?" "Why are you ashamed?" "Why are you nervous?" "Why are you ashamed?" "You have come amidst the poor." "You were so proud." "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "I do something and I say something." "I was never like this before." "I do something and I say something." "I was never like this before." "Yes, it was you!" "In the trance of love." "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "Somebody wins. Somebody loses." "This is how the world is." "Somebody wins. Somebody loses." "This is how the world is." "Why are you sitting so far away from me?" "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" "It's a serious matter." "Otherwise why would you come here?" - Thanks for the flowers. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Who are you? How did you come in? Detective! What is the reason to hide in a woman's room? First sit and ask me to sit. Then you will know the meaning too. I don't have time to waste. You can leave. If I won't go then maybe you will call the bouncer.. Pyare, and throw me out. - Cigarette please. - No, thanks. But why have you come here? I've not come willingly. This handkerchief has brought me here. Handkerchief? Whose handkerchief is this? Must be yours. Yes! Thank you so much. Sorry. For the moment I will keep it with me. Why? What is my relation to you? Not you but I do have a relation with you. And you too will form a bond with me.. If you stayed with me for a few days. Shut up! How dare you say that! Why will I stay with you? You don't need to and maybe you won't be interested. That leaves the option of helplessness. So you will be helpless to listen to me because the man whom.. You gave this handkerchief, he was accused of murder. Don't worry. I do everything with love. But what do you want? I want you to come with me to Jeetpur.. And live at Mr. Shrinath's house for a few days. Why should I go there? I don't know anything. I will find out what you don't know. By the way, it's every person's duty to cooperate with law. So it's better that you cooperate with me. Because the police have handed this case to me. I see! If this is the case, then I will come with you. But please sit for a couple of minutes. I'll get ready and come. Till then, you can glance through the magazine. - Ma'am, not there! From here! - Yes! But why do you want to take me there? Don't worry. I just want to know that the way you knew Mr. Shrinath.. Rai Bahadur, maybe you know one of his other friends too. I don't know anybody. No problem. Maybe on reaching there, you will know somebody else too. Let's go! What happened? Why are you screaming? Answer me! God! - Ghost! - Why are you both screaming? Take your hands off! Maintain distance. What happened? - There's a ghost. - Ghost! Don't try to run away. The police are guarding this place. Sir, come quickly! What happened? Why are you all screaming so much? Sir, there is something behind the curtain. Stupid! Is this why you all are making chaos! - And he scared me! - Fool! Fool! Dumb and deaf! You got scared unnecessarily! Keep quiet! Okay. I understood! Fine. What are you talking about with him? Is it your order that I should talk to everybody loudly? No, I mean.. I understand your meaning well. Thank God! You understood my meaning. Shut up! Listen! How come you know her so well? What? Me? She has come here a few times with sir. - What was she saying? - Nothing. Nothing? She was asking whether the dance records are at home or not. - Arrange for her accommodation. - Fine. - Did you call me, sir? - Yes. - What did you do the whole day? - I did so many things, sir. So many things? I just told you to keep a tab on people. I kept a watch on them too, sir. - What did you find out? - Nothing as of now. But if you and Champa's father agree then something could happen. What can happen? - Actually, my marriage with Champa. - Keep quiet! If you continue behaving like this.. Then how will I hand over any responsible task to you? Sir! You didn't marry. That doesn't mean I too shouldn't marry. Shameless! Now, henceforth, I will do whatever you say. Look, keep a close watch on the ma'am.. Who has come with me from the city. You don't worry! I will keep a watch on her, sir. Without blinking. But, sir, what if I cast an evil eye on her? Again you are being insolent! Go! Ma'am will read at the balcony. In her hand.. In her left hand, a book.. She went inside! - Mr. Rajesh! - What happened, Miss Shobha? - Mr. Rajesh! - What happened? - The black shadow man! - Where? - In my room! - Let's go! What happened? Again he escaped! There is no way here. - Where did he disappear? - Why were the bullets fired? - The black shadow man again disappeared. - What happened? I'm sure there is a secret passage here. Else a man can't vanish into the thin air. Mr. Dinanath, do you know of any secret path.. In this part of the house? I'm like a stranger in this house. Sir had made many changes in this bungalow. Then you must know which place has been renovated. But this happened before I started working here. Maybe, the doctor.. How will I know? I had been brought here for a scientific research.. And not to investigate the house. But you are the estate's trustee and you are the manager, you both.. Should know something. Look, if you people force the detective to doubt the wrong man.. Then he will be misguided. No matter what. Someday detective Mr. Rajesh will surely solve the mystery. I'm trying. You guys rest now. Who can rest in this house now? The strange thing is that today the black shadow man.. Disappeared again from the same place. And I couldn't nab him. He has fooled you well. Wait and watch whether he's fooled only me or somebody else too. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Mr. Rajesh! What happened, Miss Shobha? - What happened now? - I went to call you and the will disappeared. Good! You can't keep stolen things for long. You seem to be very happy. Happy? Not at all. In fact I regret it. I thought I'll get the chance to arrest him. You didn't get the chance and I again lost it. Do you know how important that will was for me? Even eyes don't stay on your face. - What? - Nothing. You look prettier when you are angry and worried. Somebody's in trouble. And somebody's happy. Forget it! Why do you feel so dejected for an ordinary document? For you, it was an ordinary document. But for me Why are you upset? The documents that the man mugged were ordinary papers. The police have your will. And the government lawyer.. Will come here tomorrow and state its authenticity. This is the case! Why didn't you tell me before? You should not state anything before its correct time. - Like the feelings that I have for you. - What? There are some. But how can I express it before the correct time? Then go! Even I won't express my feelings for you! At least, I know that you have some feelings for me. Where are you going so late in the night? Won't you rest? If I rest, who will look after you all? - I'm going downstairs. - Shall I also come? Why? Do you feel scared alone? Then come. It's such a nice place. But there are too many mosquitoes. Its co-incidence or else, you and I.. How we met? And how we got into this complex situation. - And now.. - What? Though I am far, still I am so close to you. And though I am far, but still, we are close. Don't say that! I think the black shadow man is going towards Lily's room. I'm going there. You go upstairs. - Who is there? - It's me, Rajesh. Yes, detective. - Who came here just now? - Nobody. But I saw the black shadow man coming towards this room. The black shadow man! My God! Tell me the truth. Where did that man go? - Believe me! I don't know! - You are lying! What are you doing here at this hour? I couldn't sleep. So I was taking a stroll. - Did you see anybody here? - No. Why is the light on in the doctor's room so late in the night? What he does and when, nobody knows that. Doctor! Doctor! Mr. Rajesh! What happened? The black shadow man! Come soon! Look! Shobha, I'll go and hide where the black.. Shadow man always disappears. Go to the hall and call me loudly. Hearing that the black shadow man will come here. And I will nab him. - Hurry up! - Okay! Mr. Rajesh, come soon! Black shadow man! What has happened! What should I do now?! You? Move! Let me check him. He has injured his head. So, he is unconscious. - Sir's mouth is bleeding. - Don't talk rubbish! Take him downstairs quickly. Mr. Rajesh is a nice man. Or else, who risks his life for somebody else? You are right. You people can leave now. Let him rest. God willing he'll get well soon. Let's go! You leave too. - Me too? - Yes. Are you giving him the injection? - You can see that. - But what is the need for that? I know that better than you. I won't let you give him injection. - It means you don't trust me? - I was.. I didn't know that you are responsible for his well being. Let it be. I am leaving. When you start trusting me again.. And your patient needs me, then call me. What's this? Who drank the milk? I see! So this is the matter! How long will you stay like this? Get up! Get up! Black shadow man! What happened? Where? You regained consciousness as soon.. As you heard about the black shadow man! So, you lie too. Yes, you played a charade to trouble everybody. And I can't lie to expose your fake unconsciousness? I pretended to be unconscious as I wanted.. To hear what others were saying. What did you get by doing this? What did you understood? I know who the culprit is. - Who is he? - You. - Me! What are you saying? - I'm telling the truth. Then handcuff me and take me to the police station. When you are ready, I won't leave you! No! "If somebody saw, they will call you crazy. No!" "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "If somebody saw, they will call you crazy. No!" "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "Look, don't stare like this." "Let me go. Don't stop my way." "Look, don't stare like this." "Let me go. Don't stop my way." "It is midnight. Everybody is asleep." "And you are harassing me." "I might die of shame." "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "If somebody saw, they will call you crazy. No!" "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "Beloved, listen. Don't use gestures." "The moon and the stars might look from the window." "Beloved, listen. Don't use gestures." "The moon and the stars might look from the window." "It is midnight. Everybody is asleep." "And you are harassing me." "Somebody might create a story from this." "Leave my hand. Beloved, no, no, no." "If somebody saw, they will call you crazy. No!" "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "I will come again. Beloved, I am your hostage." "Your eyes are connected to my heart." "I will come again. Beloved, I am your hostage." "Your eyes are connected to my heart." "It is midnight. Everybody is asleep." "And you are harassing me." "Don't be impatient. We will meet tomorrow." "Beloved, don't worry." "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." "If somebody saw, they will call you crazy." "Leave my hand." "Beloved, no, no, no." This is that will of Mr. Jogeshwar in which.. He had disinherited his eldest son Dinanath and youngest son.. Pitambar and made his other son Shrinath the sole heir. But there is another will too. In this, he had annulled the previous will.. And gave equal share to Dinanath and Pitambar.. And had disinherited Shrinath. Mr. Jogeshwar has made this will a short while before dying.. In front of late Rai Bahadur Jankinath. I beg your pardon! But what about me being the trustee of the estate.. As per Mr. Shrinath's will? As per Mr. Jogeshwar's consequent will.. The first will proves to be baseless. So, Mr. Shrinath's will that you have mentioned.. That gets automatically annulled. The will in which Mr. Shrinath has been disinherited.. That could have been forged. What if I call this as Rai Bahadur and the other brothers' ruse? So you can file an appeal in the court to prove that it is fake. Mr. Dinanath, I congratulate you. Now you are the sole heir of Mr. Jogeshwar's inheritance. Its God's divine play! How God converts a King into a pauper and a pauper into a King.. Nobody knows. I'm the sole heir of this vast estate. Yes. Because, the late Mr. Shrinath had no children and he didn't marry. But, lawyer, that's not true. Pitambar's child exists. Exists? Who's it? Where's the child? There, behind you. Miss Shobha, your niece. Shobha! Pitambar's daughter! But, how can you say that? Though Miss Shobha herself never told me this.. But I have investigated the matter completely. - What proof do you have? - We have the proof. Now there is no doubt that Ms. Shobha is Pitambar's daughter! Shobha! My niece! Come here, dear. Come near me! Am I dreaming? I'm very fortunate. Mr. Rajesh you have given me peace in my old age. Not only you, but everybody is now peaceful. Because the will that's the cause of all the quarrels has been settled. I hope now there won't be any danger of the black shadow man. Tonight everybody will be able to sleep peacefully. Can I come in? Not now! Wait! How long should I wait? I'm in hurry! God! You have come! I was just going to come! Why do you embarrass me? There is a huge difference between you and me. Forget coming to meet me its against your pride to even think of meeting me. - What has happened to you? - Nothing. I'm an ordinary man and you are the owner of this vast estate. I am not the kind of girl who will change after becoming.. The owner of this vast estate. I'll always remain the same for you. And I'll always remain the same. I didn't hope that you would express.. Your feelings for me so soon. So you have come to jest with me? Then? What? I mean, what I said in front of everybody that was wrong. - Now, what I am saying, is true. - What is true? If the black shadow man is the one whom I doubt.. Then he will launch his last attack today. Then why don't you arrest the person whom you doubt? I want to nab him red handed. Else, I got so many chances. I could have caught him anytime. Your way of working is strange. That's true. But you will have to be very careful. - This time your life is in danger. - My life? But you don't worry. I've planned everything. What? I'll sleep in your room tonight. And you will sleep in my room. - Meaning? - I'll tell you later. Ma'am! Why had you gone to the doctor's room? Just like that. Does anybody go to meet somebody without any reason? - What were you talking to him? - None of your business! What's this? Today, why are you sleeping in my place? Pick up your mattress and leave! What? Tonight something's going to happen! I'll sleep near the window! It's true! Get up! You are already dumb and deaf. I'll blind you too. Then you can rot! Get up! Come on! Is that so? Fine. Help! Help! You are dumb and you can talk! You are pretending! Forgive me! I beg you! Now, you have come on the right track. - Balram! - I forgive you! Tell me, why are you pretending to be deaf and dumb? Nothing, nothing. Tell me the truth, or else, I'll call sir. I will tell you! I will tell you! I came here as deaf and dumb. So sir took pity on me and gave me work. - Else I would have starved! - You are lying. I swear, I'm telling the truth. If you will tell anybody then I'll be in trouble. Do you think I'll spare you? You compete with me in Champa's matter? I'll never look at Champa. I'll consider her as my mother or sister. And everyday I'll give you something that will make you soar. You will see stars during daylight. Is that so? What is that thing? But please, let me remain dumb and deaf before everybody. I'll remain your slave. - You'll have to be my slave. Think about it. - Yes. Is that so? Give me a matchstick! "Again the same pain. Again the same heart." "Again the same night. Again the same fear." "I thought the pain has left." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." "Again the same pain. Again the same heart." "Again the same night. Again the same fear." "I thought the pain has left." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." "I thought the enemy's hand is chopped off." "The hurdle between two hearts has been removed." "I thought the enemy's hand is chopped off." "The hurdle between two hearts has been removed." "The days of sorrow are over." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." "Again the same pain. Again the same heart." "Again the same night. Again the same fear." "You will be my bride. And the notes will be played." "You will be my bride. And the notes will be played." "The twilight of sweet union has arrived." "You will be my bride. And the notes will be played." "The twilight of sweet union has arrived." "But there was some dearth." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." "Again the same pain. Again the same heart." "Again the same night. Again the same fear." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left.. Leaving the tail behind." "I thought I will forget. Why will I be bad?" "But your beauty is so mesmerizing." "I thought I will forget. Why will I be bad?" "But your beauty is so mesmerizing." "It has a bit of the same effect." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." "Again the same pain. Again the same heart." "Again the same night. Again the same fear." "I thought the pain has left." "The door of my heart is open." "The elephant left leaving the tail behind." Today you have come so early? But, right now, leave from here. The detective doubts us. Understand! What happened? Why don't you say something? You! Why did you come to scare me wearing this attire? Not to scare you! But to find out who is the black shadow man. - Tell me. - I don't know anything. - You are lying. - Lying? - What nonsense! - Keep quiet! Yesterday, you declined the presence of black shadow man in this room. But you don't know that.. The police have sufficient evidence against you. Why should I fear when I've not done anything? Why did you go to Rai Bahadur's place along with Shrinath? I didn't go there. - Didn't you serve liquor to Rai Bahadur? - No. You are declining everything. But the outcome will be bad. The police will arrest you! You will be sentenced! You will be imprisoned and hanged! - No! - Yes! Now tell me! Where you an accomplice in Shrinath's ruse? - No! - No? Yes! - Shrinath had gone to Rai Bahadur's place to steal the will! - Yes. - And he murdered Rai Bahadur! - Yes. And now after Shrinath's death, the man who's roaming around as the.. - Black shadow man and who wants to seize the wealth, you know him. - No. - Tell me the truth! - Yes! Tell me, who is the black shadow man? - Black shadow man! - Yes! Answer me! Answer me! Who is the black shadow man! I will tell you. I will tell you, everything. Lily! Tell me who is he? Tell me! - What happened? - Somebody fired a shot! - What happened, sir? - You and in this attire? Yes! But it was futile. Lily has been murdered. Ram Singh! Go to the city quickly and inform inspector Sinha. - Tell him to come here immediately. - Okay, sir. Now, what has again happened? Sorry. A letter for you. Who opened this? I think the post office forgot to stick it. Why are you standing? Leave! So, I was right. What happened? Shobha, today, I shot the black shadow man on his leg. A line of blood tickles from the window of your room and ends here. - So, you think.. - I'm sure. There's a secret passageway here. - Don't go inside. - Don't stop me, Shobha! I can't turn back now that I am so close to success. - Is there any danger? - Don't worry. You go downstairs. And as soon as inspector Sinha comes.. Send him to the backyard of this bungalow. I think the secret passageway ends there. - Be careful. - Don't worry. Doctor, you! I'm fine. You follow the evil black shadow man. - But you? - Don't worry about me! Quickly go! Otherwise, he will escape! Look, keep the search light ready. You all must be eager to know the culprit who's.. Hiding behind the black mask. Wait a bit longer! Initially, we doubted Miss Shobha, doctor, manager.. Dinanath, everybody. Because everybody had a motive to murder Shrinath. Even the youngest brother Pitambar who's still missing.. We doubted him too. But you all will be amazed to know that none of them is the murderer. Mr. Dinanath! This old and crippled man! You all maybe be dazed, that in spite of being old and crippled.. How he committed the murder? And how did he raise so much commotion as the black shadow man. Then? Actually, he's not Dinanath. In fact, the culprit is somebody else in the guise of Dinanath. Sir! Mr. Shrinath! Shrinath didn't die. In fact he killed his elder brother Dinanath. And he himself became Dinanath. Dinanath and Shrinath's face resembled. And he took advantage of this. This was done very carefully and cunningly. There were two motives behind this. Firstly, to escape from the charge of murdering Rai Bahadur. And secondly to gain the inheritance in the guise of Dinanath. And nobody could have thought that.. Old and crippled Dinanath is the black shadow man. Like me, even the doctor doubted him. He received the telegram of the post mortem report.. That the body belonged to a crippled man. Actually wealth and greed has made Shrinath blind! He murdered Rai Bahadur! He murdered Lily! He murdered Dinanath! And he tried to murder Miss Shobha! No matter how cunningly the crime is committed it never can be hidden. Inspector Sinha, I hand over this dangerous culprit to you! Bahadur Singh! Because my work is over now.. I take everybody's permission to leave. Listen! Am I included in the people whose permission you take to leave? Why? Do you still have some work with me? - Yes. - What? Do I have to tell you that? So, will you come with me? I'm so lucky! I had come to arrest the culprit. And I myself got arrested. Sorry, sir. What's the order for me? You come later along with the luggage by the train. Let's go.
