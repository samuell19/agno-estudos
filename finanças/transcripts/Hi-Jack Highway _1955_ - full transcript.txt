Translation by rentboy. Go on, come in. Whew, it's cold. I'd rather still be in bed. We had a frost last night. In June. Can you believe it? It's simple. There are no more seasons. - And you know why? - Because of flying saucers messing things up. - Exactly. How do you know? - 'Cause you've told me before. The stuff you come up with. That's Pierrot starting up the Renault. - You're leaving full? - With 10 tons of cables. - The kid's going to be in a mood... - Why? I was rushing to make coffee and I dropped the pot. All the same, not a real loss. - Hi, Jean. - Hi, Pierrot. - Have you had coffee? - Oh, coffee... - Why don't you ask him? - Ask him what? - Ask him who dropped the pot and ran out? - Oh, what a fuss. - Help yourself. - Thanks. You have to hand it to him. There's no way to have coffee at our place in the morning. Why? - Because of the old man's nerves. - A fuss! And then he runs out, and I get yelled at by mother. - She's up? - You think? With the racket you made going out. - Here. - Thanks. You're lucky, Pierrot. I'd love to go play the young man about Paris. Don't go play young man with the Renault. You know the gears can't take it. You hear him? I hate to break up the touching farewell but Paris is 500 kilometers away. No, thanks. - What time is it? - 9:20. We're in good shape. We'll be in Paris by 5:00. - Wow, it really hums. - Yes. Another 2000 kilometers and it's fully broken in. I'd be happier if it would be fully paid for. This is more expensive than a kept woman. I suppose it's not as much of a pain, but still. Damn, it's hot. Roll down your window. What the hell's the matter with you? Get a move on. If we have to go load up in Courbevoie, well they close at 7:00. - Give us a hand then. - I can't. I have to go get something for Alice. - He didn't go back home. - He double-crossed us. It's very simple. We'll make just like cops. We'll track down his wife. Gangsters make off with 50 millions, killing drivers in broad daylight. Pierrot, we have to go. What a joker, that F?lix! Sending us for nothing to Courbevoie and making us return empty. - A great trip. Out of my own pockets. - With your rig, it's still pleasant. If you find it so pleasant, I can lend it to you on Sundays. - What's the matter? - It's just overheating. - You don't need me? - No, it's okay. I'm taking off. - Okay, bye. - Thanks, man. Damn, I forgot my keys. Marcel, I'll take 3 pounds of stew for tomorrow. - With ribs and some skirt steak. - Just the way I like it. - Hi everyone. - Hi. Hi, Chape. Hi, Morane. - Hi, Emile. - Hi, Jean. I have a message from F?lix. - Oh, F?lix! - Mauricette, can we get the bill? - Monsieur Chape. Pierrot isn't with you? Didn't you go up to Paris together? Yes, but he got taken. - You scamp! - So, Mauricette, do we have to tickle you to get this bill? You see them? What do I look like? What did you have? Hi, M. Chape. Say, Lucienne, can you ask your boss to make me a sandwich? Always hungry. Driving does work up the appetite. Just like making love. Making love really starves me. Some have to smoke afterwards. Me, I have to eat. How many meals a day does this condition drive you to? You're awfully curious. Not that you care, but I still have that message from F?lix. He should try putting in some work. He sends us off to Courbevoie to pick up a load of paper. We get there, and nothing. So where F?lix is concerned... Now, it's 6 in the morning at Bertier's to pick up endives. He knows I hate small jobs. - How about a quick drink? - No, thanks. - One quick Calvados? - Nope. - Because of your liver? - No, for my skin. Cucumber slices on the cheeks, and no alcohol. I read it in Marie Claire. Here's your sandwich. The boss says the stale bread is easier to digest. - Oh no, your wife gave me sausage again. - You don't like it? She's known it for 20 years. Me, for 20 years, I've been telling her that wool gives me an itch. And look... Your wife can be a pain in your ass, not mine... Oh, shut up, I should be jealous. Give her my best anyway. Pierrot, you want a lift? No, I'm staying. - Bye, everyone. - See you, Jean. Happy Birthday to Mademoiselle... That's clever. Happy Birthday. Not clever, but not mean. I'd even say, very nice. It's not your style to wish happy birthdays, especially mine. - You cheat. - What? You saw the blackboard. Here's the proof. - Forgive me. - I can do better. Come here. Wait, let me close the curtains. They saw you arrive. That's enough. When your truck spends the night outside, you should see how the women look at me. - What could they be jealous of? - Hey, watch it. Okay, turn on the lights. Shit! My fault. I should have warned you. It's a new chest. Nice, no? More than that, it's well placed. - Forgive me. Here, all better. - Better, better... I didn't even ask you what it was. Wait. Let me guess. - Candied fruits. - No. - A scarf? - No. - Is it in the area of clothing? - Yes and no. More yes. "The Wolf and the Lamb" "A lamb was quenching its thirst In the water of a pure stream." "The Farm. At dawn, the rooster crowed in the valley. "The plowboy hummed." Say, they don't write so badly, your little kids. - I disagree. - I said that to make you happy. Good thing you closed the curtains. You don't often give presents, but when you do... you do it in style. I think it's lovely. - Why are you smiling? - No reason? Instead of staying in this godforsaken place, if you came home with me... Well? - Well, I'd eat better. - I love your romantic, poetic side. You're full of mysteries. Kidding aside, I wonder why you stay here. Don't tell me the kids couldn't find someone else to help them graduate. You'd come live at my place. And in 2 years, I'd give up driving. I'd let others take the wheel. And 2 years later, you'd blame me for making you stop. Of course, the prospect of living with me... I wouldn't hesitate to live with you. And you know it. Except you won't be there very often. And when you're there, we'll never be alone. What about your buddies? I know them well. I'd be living between two extremes, a full house or an empty house. The restaurant or the waiting room. - You're never happy. - Oh, but I'm very happy as I am. I'd be even happier if I saw you more often. No, take this one. It's riper. - Not true. - It is. Not the apple. I'm talking about you. It's untrue to say you're happy. You'd be the first woman ever to be happy. No, the lady is well educated. The lady wants to retain her independence. The lady is modern. - Is that all? - Once upon a time, women stayed home. They cooked, cleaned, ironed and washed the dishes. Nowadays, they vote and read pulp fiction. - End result... - End result? End result: they buy apples that are either unripe or rotten. - I don't want your apples. - Leave them. To think that instead of husband, I took a lover for fun. I say that sin doesn't pay. You haven't always said that. I'll return it and bring back another one a size smaller. What an idea. I'll fix it myself, and well too. We modern women... Is your alarm clock always late? Perfect. On top of everything, he's waking me up at dawn. I have to go pick up endives at 5:00. At 5:00? That's just great. Not so young, piggish, rude, grouchy, and always wandering off... - I wonder why I love you. - Because I'm handsome. - Handsome, even in the dark. - You idiot. - What is it? - It's me. I'm coming. Damn it. - What's the matter? - A tough break. What? There was a guy lying down in the road right after a curve. I didn't have time to break. I ran right over him. I don't know if he had some kind of attack or if it was me, but he's dead. - You're soaked. Some hot coffee? - No. But if he was in the middle of the road, you're not responsible. Not responsible... Gee, you're swell. - What do the police say? - What do you mean? - You didn't go to the police? - No. I'm glad you came here, but you have to go see them. They'll want to know where I came from. Then everyone will know I was coming from your place. They already know. Thanks for thinking of that. - Go now. - What a thing to have happened. Shit. "So I exited the vehicle to bring first aid to the victim. "That's when I noticed he was dead." Confirmed and signed. - You can go take a rest. - Thank you. Gentlemen. What about me? - You? - Yes. These men from the DA's office want to ask you some questions. It will be useful for the report, just to confirm everything. - Still not finished? - Eh... - Tell me. - Yes? - Hadn't you been drinking? - What? We know what it's like. You have a tough job, especially at night. You need some extra support, to help you fight sleep. So a quick glass here, a fortified coffee there. It's not a bad thing. But the reflexes become uncertain. You brake after instead of braking before. You were coming from Paris? - Yes. - Going to? To Montjoie. - By way of Retournac!? - So? - Not the most direct route. - Unless you're playing hooky. I stopped off at some friends'. What's the big deal? Yes, until 4 in the morning. One loses track of time at your friends'... Just as I said. You dine with friends, linger at the table. One drink leads to another, and another after that. The hours pass easily, the drinks less so. Then you get behind the wheel mid-digestion. As you can see, we know the drill. Your legs are heavy, so you brake a bit late. And since you're carrying excess freight... We know that trick too. - You know a lot of things. - Experience. - 80% of truckers are over the freight limit. - And with defective brakes. I see. We'll talk about all this in Clermont. Come on, we're taking you in. My truck? We're impounding it. Impounding? A brand new rig in the pound? Aren't you a little... You're treating me like a murderer. What have I done? I was driving on the right, the guy was in the middle of the road. And then... Oh, the hell with this! That's it. Let's go. Hello, I'm the mayor. If I can be of any help... Thank you. I don't see how. I'll let you know if the occasion comes up. You're going to become popular around here. - Is there something I can get you? - Not at all. - Call me when you can, okay? - Of course. All set? Let's go. I'll come see you later at the police station. Don't worry, Mr. Mayor, I turned in my resignation this morning. - Will they keep him long? - Why would they keep him? Why would they take him in? - Send your report to Clermont. - Very well. Hello? Give me Retournac 14, please. Retournac 14! This is Clermont 16 56. Clermont 16 56! That's it. Thanks. Can't hear anything with your machine. It was working fine when Bertier called earlier. He was left holding his 3 tons of endives. You should have heard him. I sent him Julien. That's not all. You'll have to forfeit your Paris contracts. - Can't we wait a little? - Wait for what? For clients to start suing? No, thanks. Don't worry. Get your truck back. We'll find a stopgap. We can do charcoal or something else. - I'd rather something else. - Where's the shame in charcoal? Nowhere, but 15 km each way, that's a job for a taxi. I didn't buy a 15 ton rig to be a taxi. I didn't take on 6 millions worth of equipment for that kind of work. 6 millions I haven't even finished paying back. - Do you have an installment due? - Yeah, and not a cent to pay it. You know that if I had anything, you wouldn't even have to ask. Look, F?lix, I've never hit you up for money. - I've only ever asked for freight. - Freight? You need a truck for that. Damn, take it easy. Is it my fault if my truck is stuck in the pound? Weren't you the one who sent me off to pick up endives at 5 in the morning? - Did I also send you off to your bird's? - Whoa, you've got a nerve... Hello, Retournac 14? Is it you, Alice? Yeah, so-so. Right now, I'm at F?lix's. We're just chatting. If you like, but I can't be there before 1:30. No, because I have to take the bus. See you soon. Bye. You should go get some rest. You might see things clearer afterwards. I'll only see the ceiling clearer. A trucker without a truck is unemployed. Say what you want, but it's just beginning. When things start to go wrong... - I wonder what's falling on me next. - I am. I resigned this morning. I'll be at your, I mean, our place in a week. But don't worry. We'll stick to our old habits: love making and bourgeois cooking. But you're coming at a bad time. What do I do with an empty garage? I have to tell you, a 15 ton rig takes up room. So do 54 kilos, you'll see. - It'll help pass the time. - You think? Why the hell did I insist on taking on a new rig? - Because you wanted it. - Of course, I wanted it. I thought I was a big shot. I look like such a fool. Florent! Where are your manners? Go to the wall. Go home and get some rest. You'll feel better tomorrow. I'll send the children back in. What are you doing here? As you see, I just got up. When you could have stayed in bed for once? If I were in your shoes... I've been getting up at 5 for 20 years. That's not going to change overnight. - Are you coming? - Were are you guys going? - To Puy, 5 trips. A real treat. - Don't tell me it's not a plum job. - There's no such thing as a plum job. - There is. Other people's. - Nothing for me? - No, nothing today. - You want alcohol or after-shave? - After-shave. You're right. It's better. Tell me, the guy who died... Is the funeral tomorrow? Are you going? What for? It's not my place. - Hi, Chape. - Hi, Guibert. I left some bales of cloth back in Marseille. Could you pick them up before Thursday? That's awkward. I've just hit a snag. I'm without a truck for a few days. Darn. There's enough for 7 or 8 trips. Too bad. Maybe next time. - Sure. Bye. - Bye. Goodbye. Where were we? Oh yes, the funeral. It's tomorrow. Is that after-shave coming? - You could at least come to the cemetery. - This bastard has dragged us around enough. Thanks for accompanying me. I won't bother you anymore. - My train is at 5:12. - Like Scoppo, it will leave without you. - What does this mean? - From now on, we're sticking together like a family, a family that's experienced a tragedy. Get in. What a pain this truck has been. Hey, don't make it worse. - You want to fix it yourself? - Two days of work. Back in my day, this would only take a couple of hours. The more they perfect those machines, the more complicated they get. Pretty soon, you'll need a college degree to work at a gas station. My dream is to live in an older era with horse-drawn carriages. Carriages, two-wheel buggies and silent movies. I get the picture. - What is it? - I can go get my truck tomorrow Thursday. Great! Are you pleased? - I'm better. - We're thrilled. Pierrot, tell your ma to uncork the Muscadet. My replacement arrives Monday. They must have been praying for my resignation. - So when are you moving in? - When I'm done measuring. - Measuring what? - I come with furniture. A table, 3 chairs and a chest of drawers. It's not worth much but the chest is from mom. Well, if it comes from mom... Pierrot, any Beaujolais left? Nope, it's all empty. When it's good, there's no harm. Don't mind if I have some more. - Way to go, chef. - But we're running dry. - Another bite, Mlle Alice ? - No thanks. I'm not used to eating this well. If you don't mind my saying so, it's not often that you'll get to eat rabbit like this. It's not just a matter of herbs and mushrooms. You also need friendship. What matters most in life is friendship. Friendship? More like friendship and Beaujolais. - What? - I'm talking to Jean. - Another piece? - No, I'm ready for the cheese. I see your husband is a first-rate cook, Mme Ragondin. He cooks a rabbit once a year. The rest of the year, he keeps comparing his rabbit and my cooking. Except when he's eating at Jean's. He doesn't mouth off at other people's tables. Other people's? Why not say strangers while you're at it? You could say Jean's is my annex, my branch office. "Could say," because when it comes to private matters, I'm discretion itself. - Right? - I'm sure. You'll see. I only pass through. The catch is, he starts passing through at 6 in the morning. For a while, I thought of putting a bed for him upstairs. Don't listen to him. It's not that bad, not at all. Jean is right. Instead of teasing me, come help me get some more Beaujolais. - Beaujolais has a way of flowing. - Don't move. I need the exercise. Let me stretch my legs. That's funny. Your stairs seem steeper today. Do me a favor, turn on the light. I think we'll make a hell of a team. - Who will? - The three of us. Not to boast, but I think your girl spotted me. Well, buddy, you're easy to spot. Both you and your kid are. As easy to spot as a gun nest in a cherry tree. You're jealous. Oh, he's so jealous. - Or just drunk. - What do you mean, drunk? You think 3 will be enough? - Give me one. - Here, take it. - Out of my way. - Go ahead. A word of advice: Strike while the iron is hot. 'Cause afterwards... Lucien has been talking about painting the kitchen for years. You'll learn. Put them on the bottom shelf, please. Thanks. You'll learn about arthritis too. - Hey, Alice. - Did I wake you? No, no. Say, that chest of drawers, shall we go take its measurements? Leaving already? Yes, we'll see ourselves out. Please don't wake your husband, thanks. Goodbye, Alice. - He really tied one on. - Aren't you also a little... Who, me? Hey, I can hold my liquor. Still, I can use a nap. Okay, but not right away. That's funny. A couple of glasses of Beaujolais. especially when I'm in a bad mood... Here. You gotta love paper pulp. You put in 8 hour days and you stay in the area. Plus every night, you get to yell at me. Isn't life grand? Not bad. That's what the paper said. And you thought the trip was for nothing. - All right, lay off. - Well, it's a good start, no? - You know them? - No. - Could they be cops? - Why do you say that? They look a bit off. - Well, so long. - So long. - Who gets the eggs? - I do. Thanks. - Do you believe it? - Tough luck. Hey, Lulu, you've got a good eye. Have you by any chance spotted a gray sedan with Paris plates cruising around route 82 or 88? No, why? Friends of yours? No, I was just curious. I'll let you know if I see anything. - Hurry up, Camille, I got bills to pay. - Here it is. - It isn't sausage by any chance? - No. Thanks for your trust. - Put it on my tab. Bye. - Okay, bye. Wait, can you give me a lift? My truck's in the shop. - Don't come home late. - Don't worry. Mme Serin? I'll have another one. - He's not in the school, is he? - Shut it. We'll stake him out here. I just need to empty out the dresser. Everything else is packed. - Can you move me out tomorrow? - I can't, tomorrow. Day after. I see. My replacement has been staying at the hotel since yesterday but I don't want to take advantage. The kids are here. I have to go. While you're here, you might as well take a few things with you. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Sit down. You small ones, copy these letters. And we, we'll have a dictation. - Are you ready? - Yes, mademoiselle. "On grates... "made of clay... "made of clay... lay drying thousands of prunes." "thousands... of prunes. Full stop. "Cooked and roasted by the sun... they were exquisite." Deray! As punishment for disturbing the class, you get an extra math problem. Page 234, number 16. "they were exquisite." "they were exquisite." Maybe he's got a kid in school... - We could work him over some. - Yes, with or without a kid. - You want my advice. - No, you hold the wheel, I drive. I have no use for your idiotic ideas. Get in. Hey, he's robbing the joint. Let's go. - Thanks, bye. - Bye. Do you have a light? - Monsieur Chape? - Madame I am Mme Scoppo. The widow Scoppo. I'd like to talk to you. Please come in, and forgive the mess. Hey, Chape came home with a bird. - Mauricette? - Of course not. - So what do you care? Your turn. - I'm coming. Please, sit down. He was lying down across the road oh, about 10 meters from the car. His lights were off. It was just after the road turns. I hit the brakes, but I was already over him. I can assure you he didn't suffer. Those who leave don't suffer as much as those who stay. I'm sorry. - How about a drink? - Thank you, but not too strong. Goodness, it's strong. But that's fine. Thank you. What a day I had! I had to watch them dispose of the body at the hospital. Aside from a rude policeman, I was completely alone. It was awful. - Are you married, M. Chape? - No, not exactly. Then, I doubt you can understand. Antoine and I still loved each other as much as the day we met. Maybe even more. He was on the road a good part of the year, selling tools. Sometimes I wouldn't see him for weeks. It seemed natural, given his job. And now... May I be frank with you? - Please. - I hate to discuss money but my husband was carrying a very large amount of cash in a leather briefcase. I say again that I hate to discuss money. Would you happen to have... noticed this briefcase? No, but I didn't search the car. Did you ask the cops? They say they didn't find anything. I have no reason to doubt them. And me? - Doubt you? - Yes. I don't doubt you either. Not really. I know this is painful to discuss, but just between us, haven't you ever dreamed of having a lot of money? Say, tens of millions in front of you on a car seat, at night, on a fortuitously empty road. What would you do? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying. I've been insane with grief. And to have this money go missing when I need it so desperately. I'll be in Clermont for a few days. At the H?tel du Midi. If you find out anything... What would I find out? Don't hesitate to call. Good night. Forgive me for bothering you. Forgive me for not showing you out. I'm telling you he's a tough guy. I know what I'm talking about. You'll have to work him over, and hard, before he gives up the money. - We'll beat it out of him. - But not before I say so. Your proper methods are completely outdated. - I preferred you as a brunette. - So did Scoppo. But me... I like variety. Where the hell is he? It's almost 4:00. Are you crazy? The bus driver's coming. - Did you see that? - Not really. What happened? What happened is those guys almost wrecked me! - Can I give you a hand? - No, it's okay. - Okay, so long. - I can't believe this. I hate to leave Mme Scoppo alone too long. It might give her ideas of independence. So keep her company. You have no problem with that, do you? We have to wrap everything up within 24 hours. - So? - We missed him. - Because... - Because. Going to keep missing long because? - Where are the others? - On the job. I had an argument with Chwob and I stormed off. I have a temper. A temper you have. What you don't have are nerves. To put it politely. The trucker should have spilled by now. You're the one who said, "If he doesn't talk, I'll beat him up. and if Chwob objects, same goes for him." You sure talked a big game. Except that when it comes to walking the talk... I'm completely fed up! Hey, old man, I just had a break-in. Let's go in the back. They broke the front door. Look at this mess. Just look at it. - What a waste. - Come here. Did you happen to notice a gray car roaming around here, a sedan? I've only been around for a half hour. The missus is off doing the wash since noon. Did they take anything? They didn't find what they wanted. Here's my dough. - Shall we go to the cops? - I want to handle this myself. I think I'm beginning to figure out what the hell's going on. We should tidy up. Alice arrives tomorrow. She shouldn't walk in on this. Good point. I'll go see her. I'll come back very late. Ask Maria to tidy up a bit. So if madame had her way, we'd grab him in broad daylight in a restaurant and we'd hold his feet to the fire to make him cough up the money. - Do I have it right? - It wouldn't have to be so clumsy. - Your way could take 20 years. - Buy some property. It'll accrue in value. Not to take her side, it's true we're not making any progress. We've been stuck in this rat hole for over a week now. Not comfy enough? For 50 large ones, I'd wait barefoot in the snow. I'd walk across burning coals. I'd wade through shit. Believe me, I'm as eager as you are. And I wouldn't want to be in the trucker's shoes. That's nice to hear. When I think about the way this bastard wasted Antoine. Although, it looks like Antoine has already been forgotten. No, don't worry. Scum like him is never forgotten. Remember to show some respect for the dead. Remember that before he died, we were after him to kill him. The trucker swiped our prey. Trouble is, he also swiped our dough. What we have to settle with him is strictly about the dough. Okay, off to bed everyone. Tomorrow's a big day. Mourning becomes you. The misfortune of some... I'll help you. Oh, it's you! What a surprise! I only expected you tomorrow morning. - See how I've been living. - Thing is... - Come. Have you eaten? - No. I have ham and eggs. Are we eating here or leaving right away? Er, well, you're not leaving anymore, I mean, not tonight anyway. Oh, great idea for a prank. But see? I'm being a good sport about it. I'd prefer you weren't such a good sport. As it happens, it's the truth. - The truth? - Yes. You could warned me you wanted to stay solo instead of letting me imagine idiotic things. I haven't had time to imagine things. They just happened. Look, I didn't want to worry you, but you know those guys who've been dogging me. They're paying me visits now. Earlier, I came home to find the house upside down... drawers smashed open, dishes broken... - Did they rob you? - Not even. That's what's bugging me. Wow. I'm trying to figure out what they're after. They're making my life hell. Instead of looking for trouble, you're better off going to the police. I've been there. Remember what they did to my truck. Since nothing was stolen, they'll say I'm a joker. If not my dough, they'll eventually have to tell me what it is they do want. You're wrong to play that game. I don't want anything to happen to you. Nor I to you. That's why I'd feel better if you stayed at Serin's place. - At Serin's? That's not a hotel. - No, but it's reputable. To truckers, not to me. In the morning, I like to wash with hot water and I prefer tea to an omelet, however delicious. You'll only stay for 2 or 3 days. I'll move your stuff once I've cleared this up. - Agreed? - I have no choice. Here's Jojo. He's crawling, he must be fully loaded. Wait for me a minute. What's up? I think my guys are here. I have something to settle with them. Well, gentlemen. Surprised? You've been buzzing around me like hornets. Well, here I am. Do you have something to say? I'm your man. But hurry it up. Some of us have to work. So what you do you want? Be seated. Easy, easy. What are you looking for? - Looking for? - Yes. - 50 large. - What? 50 millions. The dead guy's 50 millions. Ah! Madame is with the group. So, we were talking about those 50 large. You want an explanation? You're not really trying to bluff? The lady's husband left Paris on the 11th with 50 millions in a leather briefcase. On the 12th, he was found on the road. - But without the 50 large. - Meaning? - Meaning get the picture? - Ah. I've never seen your 50 large. Now listen to me. You're going to get out of here at full speed, no brakes. First cops, then thugs. I've had it! Impoundment, break-in, and now your mugs! I'm fed up! Next time you're seen here, it will be in a ditch. Get it? - The road belongs to everyone. - Precisely. So take it! On the double! Go, get out! Go! Yeah, that's right! You need to get carried out? Let's go! Head first or feet first? Not here, you idiot! Wow. - Jojo, I'll meet you back at Serin's. - Okay. Wait at the hotel. We have some business to attend to. Is this what you're looking for? Save it. They keep track of bags here. You double-crossed everyone. I'd have bet it was man's work to kill a guy like Scoppo. Good luck selling it as a crime of passion. Let's go. You sure showed them. They must be running scared. That's so mean. You just lost yourself a customer. She was planning on settling here. Okay, here's to us. And down the hatch. Cheers. - You didn't finish your sausage. - I'm full. Yes, it's me. What do you want? For Chape? No need to take a message. He's right here. I'll put him on. It's the old man. Yes. What's going on? Your guys are back. They're out in front of your place. They had left, but then came back. What do I do? You do absolutely nothing. Just wait for me. Those guys are back. - The nerve. - Are we going? - Let's go get them. - No, it's my business. But since they're faster than I am, this is what we're going to do. We'll block all the roads, and stop them from getting on the highway. Jojo, you take Cr?tes road. Lulu, you take Ventouse pass. And Emile, take Murolle road. - I'll call Big Robert to join in. - Okay. What about me? You're coming with me. And you, wait for us here quietly. Okay, bye. Big Robert's in. We're counting on you, F?lix, okay? Hurry. Hello. Give me the police, please. Paulo. We're drawing too much attention. Let's take a spin for a half hour. - What's the matter with you? - Never you mind! They just took Besse road. Lulu's on their tail. Jean wants you to stay put. We'll cut them off at Dames road. He could have parked his rig better. - They've all broken down. - No, something's fishy. Just back out. Can you take me to the police station? MEATS The other bitch is getting close. We're gonna die, I tell you. We're gonna die! Only if you don't shut up! - If you don't pass, we're stuck! - Would you rather drive? We've got to pass. It's our last chance to get the hell out of here. Here, let me give you a drink. - Which one of you is Chape? - I am. - Inspector Baudier from Paris. - So? You ran over a dead man. The wife did it. I'm taking them all to Clermont. We'll get your statement tomorrow. Okay. We're going to the hospital. We'll meet you back at Serin's. - All those sleepless nights for this? - It's over. We can get back to normal. You have another 5 minutes. I'll handle coffee.
