Sheriff all of you changed nothing from now on, Judicial Research and Training Institute 21th, let's get started with Pre-Jury System. Prosecutor, defend the case. The undertrial, Lee Dong Gu, kidnapped young Choi Ji yoeng, molested, smashed her with stone and cruelly killed her. This is already proven by National Forensic Service. This trial, there is no necessity continuing this trial in any parts. I rest my case. Lawyer, defend. The obvious proof that he's talking about, confirmed testimonies. These are the mistake of this trial. Your honor, - The lawyer is in contempt of Court.. - Mistake? Yes the prosecutor on this case isn't the guy who had been assigned to this case. This case, unlike other cases, he must look back the evidences and situations on the day but he's defending based on trumped-up litigation records and fraudulent data which is made by detectives long time ago. Oh, so the lawyer, are you the lawyer who had been assigned to this case? Are you? No I rest my case. But I am sure that I was there. You were there? Yes there.. I was there.

First, loosen the belt - helps blood circulation. - Blood circulation!? - Yes. - Then why did you choke her? I didn't choke her neck second, give a pressure on the chest next free airway cover one's nose 12 times in a minute, give the air in. Okay, you are doing great. Next?

Do we have any law in criminal law like "don't listen and believe whatever gangster and swindlers say?" - None, but... - Look. So, gangsters always make bullshits? Is there any law there like this!? None.. I'm done with examination of a witness.. It's not Examination! It's a questioning! Am I a student!!? - Quiet! - Sorry sir. Lawyer, do you have any other witness? As the prosecutor wanted, I have one who never commited a crime, but served this country with honor. I call him as a witness in Sungnam prison, security Chief, I'm Jang Min Ha - as you know, there is a prisoner in our... - How have you been doing? I believe that you have 3 meals in a day, you will exercise everyday, and after 9 PM, you will go to bed. Sir.. I can't ask you this but.. I'm asking you to investigate again. While we are investigating again, someday the prisoner will be released from the prison, right? Lee Yong Goo. He's not the criminal have you.. Lost a son or daughter before? I have lost..

Loosen the belt first to help blood circulation - yes! I can't recall what really happened. Have you smashed her head to kill her? No... Ji Young fell down... Look, Yong Goo. What did I say. If you can't remember what to say? I.. - I don't remember.. - Yes. That's how you do it! I don't..I don't remember - Happily. - Happily. Okay, good job! - A brick fell on her head. - Have you seen it happening? - I haven't... - What's wrong with you! - Even if you haven't seen it, you should pretend! - Then.. I was doing CPR... Hey... Yong Goo... Yong Goo! Do it in the morning, morning! Yeah... your honor, I.. Am.. An intellectually handicapped person detectives..hit me .. Without asking.. - Try to read it. - What's this all about? Famous line, so famous! I am the one who wrote! Sign on it, sign! Don't you get it dirty don't eat it!

You know polices? Yeah... police - scary..police. - Yeah... the head of those scary men. He's really mad now. He might do something to your daughter yeah.. Fucking annoying.. Lawyer lawyer this is.. A petition from the prisoners this shit doesn't help. Even though you are a national lawyer, isn't it too much? You think It will change with an effort? Try to look at this look at this! Lee Yong Goo isn't enough smart to write this! You still think he's the criminal!? For Yea Seong.. Stay awake, focus.. Yeah.. I will go home, home.. Yeah.. Don't you worry, you can go home. - Okay? - Yeah. Ji Young said.. She will let me know where to buy Sailor Moon bag - tell the prosecutor everything, okay? - Okay..

You sacrifice yourself for Yea Seong You know what I mean? You are a father! Have you smashed her on purpose because she resisted from the sexual molestation? I am asking you again have you smashed her head with a brick? - The accused? - Yeah? - Answer me. - Yeah? Be purged of sin or else I will do the same to your daughter answer me. Yeah??

I did it, Help Yea Seong. What the heck are you doing!? You are a lawyer lawyer isn't for this!! Detectives in that time they took only witness's statements, they completely ignored the accused's statement even if he denied it Lee Yong Goo's statement had been forged, they interrogated with violence forced, threathened him Forged... Also the scar on Choi Ji Young's forehead isn't the main reason. But the proof that the broken backhead is the main reason why she died had been also ignored. Lee Yong Goo's statement which is submitted by prosecutor includes that he choked her neck but autopsy result that proves nothing was found of any pressure on her neck had also been... ignored... lawyer, last defense. Your honor, I ask for favorable arrangements please. The prosecutor, demand a penalty. Since the accused had admitted.. We demand a death sentence for Lee Yong Goo your honor the investigation was focused on proving if he's guilty or not without considering all the situations he's got. It was defintely a unreasonable investigation. They ignored a basic principle which is presumption of innocence the fact that the accused is an intellectually handicapped person and the fact the accused loves his daughter so much, they abused them to give up all the situations he had for his... daughter for the expediency of investigative authority, - He is falsely accused.. - We, the justice department, since the accused admitted all the crimes, we come to a definite decision that the demand of the prosecutor, a death sentence for Lee Yong Goo the accused Lee Yong Goo is given a death sentence thank you thank you thank you I did it all wrong..I.. Help Yea Seong. Yea Seong... I'm sorry. That's why I, the lawyer am here to clear his name from the false charge from a sentence of death to make things .. All clear for him..
