Going up, Ken? I'm here to see Duke. Hmm. Me too. I hear Helen's due soon. We're having a little girl. They smell a bit funny, don't you think? I don't mean little girls, I just mean babies in general. They smell funny. Well she'll be our first, I'm not really sure. Well let me tell you something that I'm sure of, Ken. We're not the fucking bank. So what the fuck is that? I just need some more time, please. Please, can I speak to Duke? You wanted a loan. You came to us, yes? - Yes. - Yes. They say it costs around 400 grand to raise a kid these days. I read this thing in a baby magazine. You read it in a baby magazine. You read it in a baby magazine. You having a joke, Ken? No, mate, no, it's fact, all right? It's a fact. You read it in a baby magazine? You read it, yeah? Stop! I can pop your eyes out from out here. Ange! Leave. Hey, music man. Hey. How you going? Got any tunes for me? Nice. This the masterpiece, Childish Gambino? It's more like the entr√©e Still waiting for the inspiration, you know? That'll do the trick. Ways. And you've gotta yield because I win! Fucking English, you fucking... English! English, English! A broken man has nothing to give. Yeah. But I would have had the money by now. Maybe. But with a bit of care they'll be borrowing from us again and again. He owes us. He owes me, Ange. He owes me. And one day everything will be under your control but you gotta realise, brute strength is not always the way. Sometimes you need to use your brain. Eh, Bonnie? Pass me those tablets, would you? You know you should put her out of her misery. I'll put you out of your fucking misery. She has heart. Come on, hey. That's good. Why not. Fuck are you doing here? Oy, what the fuck are you doing here?! Hey that's enough. Mate, mate, that's enough. Come on. Hey, they're doing nothing, all right? Just chill, dude, you right? Cool, just relax. Just relax, man. You okay? I'm good, I'm good, I'm good! What the? fuck! Hey! Jesus. Fucking traitor! Fuck. Come on, are you okay? Go, go, go! Down! Oh fuck. What the fuck? Fuck, fuck. I can't breathe. Look, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Hey, calm down. I can't breathe! It's okay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Breathe, breathe. Shh, shh, breathe. Look at me. You're okay, look at me. You're all right, you're okay. You're okay. I'm Claudio. I'm Jaiwara. Yeah, yeah, I can go to Miriam's. I'm okay, really. Is that your family? Yeah, my mom. Should I take you back home then? I don't wanna go back there right now. I love a good cup of tea, don't you? Helps me to think straight. What happened is a tragedy. And I see it, it's happening all over the world. It's like a cancer, a monster. And yet what, you come to me and you accuse me of what? Being that monster? Why, where are my fingerprints? I understand this is not America, Jeffrey, this is my home. Where I grew up, where we grew up. And I care what manifests here. You do all right, Detective. You do better than all right, if I recall. Yeah, well, this has attracted eyes from every direction and they all want answers, answers I don't have. I mean it's all these bloody eyes, you know? Angelo and his mates have turned it into a fucking jungle out there. Mate, it's always been that way. No, it hasn't, it's different now, Duke. He is out of control. I mean a bit of dope, your business loans, brothels, whatever, sure. But this! I can't do anything for you. Is that so? It's all about the drugs, Duke. And your name is on everyone's lips. You know, you need to get away. Take a holiday or something. I think maybe you're right. I've not been feeling myself lately. I might go and sit on a beach. Get a tan, put my feet up. Good. That's a good idea. And I'll do everything I can to help you. But I can only help you if you're not here to help. And I swear to God you should cut Ange loose. You have always been a little maggot, Jeffrey, always the worrier. Ever since we were at school, you got too many fingers in too many pies. Yeah well there ain't no guarantees now, Duke. You work for me, you leech! If Angelo's not released within the hour, you'll be in there next to him. My best to Catherine and the kids. The boys are still at their private school? Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'll do what I can for Angelo. But you need to disappear. I heard you the first time. So he had a wife and two kids. He was in the army until a few years ago. Served in Afghanistan. They say war turns people mad. Or mad people make such wars. You okay? Oh yeah, sorry, just brought back. Yeah I'm fine. Police. Open up. Mr Sutherland. Nasty business down the flats. Not my business. Oh yeah. Sure it wasn't one of your pieces that he used? You mean yours? Don't play any fucking games with me, Farouk. I assure you, we're not playing games. The gun was not from us. Good. 'Cause the last thing we need is a fucking holy war. Right? Have a nice night, Mr. Sutherland. How about him? Bank robber. Studying Security Systems. I bet you're right. I saw you this morning. What? Yeah before the, um, I walked past you in the flats. I didn't see you. I smiled at you. But you were all like. I would have smiled back. What were you listening to? Just music. Who? Mine. It's just some stuff I make. Can I hear it? No. Well. Maybe it's just not finished yet, so. I don't care, come on. Please? All right. But I mean it's like, it's not finished or anything, so. It's beautiful. Yeah? It's been the strangest day. Yeah. I woke up yesterday, just go about buying some dope and playing my music. It's my birthday today. What? Well, yesterday. Why didn't you? Thanks for spending it with me. Just doesn't feel right. Yeah well, we'll see. Duke. No. You right? Give us a minute, will you, Perce? You all right? Yeah. What are they gonna do? You need to clean this mess up. I didn't pull the fucking trigger. He was one of your idiot customers. I told you before about that stuff. It makes us a lot of cash. They were regular people, they were innocent. Women and kids, Mrs. Doh from 87. Ange, you fucking look at me! It's done. The meth stops now, is that clear? As the night sky. That stuff rapes the bloody soul. It's gone. I love you like my own but I will not hesitate to bury you myself. Duke. You have my word. Ok. I'm heading out of town. For a few months, maybe more. This'll blow over. I don't have a choice. Fucking Sutherland? No, it's above him. He's a fucking dog. Hey, it'll settle. It'll settle if you give it a chance to do so. What? Well you're in charge here now. I don't want it. I wasn't asking. It's time to grow up, Angelo. What about him? Percy knows his place, hay! And I know yours. People are watching, do not fuck this up. I won't. And no phones. Percy knows where to find me. Make sure Ken's family are looked after. Of course, of course. And I never wanna see him again. You cool? Fuck, he's looking old. Yeah. Hey. Hey yourself. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You know you could have actually just taken a holiday. Yeah. You right, girl? Here we are. What are you gonna call him? Well she says her name is Jenna. It means small bird. And can she fly? One day, maybe. It's beautiful, huh? Yeah. Back home when I was a kid we had his restaurant with an open roof. My dad and I would lie on the tables and we'd try to count all the stars. That's cool. He died in an attack on our building. It was always the four of us, you know. Then one day, just three. Jeez, I'm so sorry. We lost our father. My brother almost lost his sight. It's been difficult ever since. This, um, us. It isn't easy. My family, they're not as modern as some. In my world, we're forbidden. And how do you feel? Is that you? Yeah. You're adorable. How long have you lived here? A while. Quite a long time. No one can find us. I don't care anymore. Have you been with many women before? Hundreds. I was pretty notorious at school. Stop it. No. I mean, once, but... not like this. Have you ever? And you don't mind? I want to, just not yet. What I want is to shut my eyes and when I open them you're there. This is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in. On. Not in, you sit on a chair. It's nice as all. Quiet. A bloke could get used to a place like this. Yeah, it's quiet. Well it would be if you stopped saying it is. Well have a look around though. It's a bloody castle, mate. It's a prison, it's just a fancy one. Well I'll take it. Come on, people like you and me would die if we had to live in places like this. It's too late to change that. We're from the flats. And that's where I met Karen, your mom's there, it's where Rosie was born. There's too many memories, Perce. I have people who don't know where they are, don't know who they are, they're barely people at all. Maybe. Maybe you're right. I am fucking right. It was clearly a goal - Yeah but I still love this fucking chair. Ange! Shh. The Flemington boys are at me. They want eight ounces. It's a lot of cash, mate. Look, things have died down, all right? There's no heat anymore. There's always heat. Sometimes you just can't see it. You don't owe him anything, mate. All right, you've done your time and more. Look at them. Fucking beautiful little things. Just swimming about. Look how they protect and look after their family. Yeah. Yep. Mate, we're getting left behind. It's easy money. Fuck it. Set it up. Hey, I got you a little something. Farouk, it's Hementh. See you tonight? See you tonight? I was at Uni all day. Not just today. Your studies. Yeah, they're going well. I'm with friends. These friends. I'm happy. Is that not enough? Yeah. You should try it. Have a good night. Jaiwara. His name is Claudio. Claudio? I'm serious. What did he want? Flemington loved it. They want double. You're the boss now Ange. This is your license to print your own fucking money. You see that? What? Nothin' Tell them it's 5 grand an ounce now. What ever you think Ange! What ever you say. Hey Lukey! Flood this fucking town. He reckons loans have been good. That's a lot. Yeah, it is. She hasn't been eating a thing. Yeah she's probably just tired. But it's spelt Ya'aburnee Y.A. No,. It's a different, yeah, that's not bad. And it means, you bury me? So, Jaiwara. Are you planning to kill me? Love me that much? I was saying... It means for me to die first because I can't live without you. Not in this lifetime. I love you. And I you. Hey. Enough! Do you know who I am? If you ever see my sister again, I'll tear your heart out of your white chest. It is over. Long live the king. I'm so sorry. They're animals. You didn't tell me you brother was Farouk Nassar. I know, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Farouk Nassar. How can we ever be together? I tried, I tried to tell you on the beach. You didn't. Last time I was in a church was my mom's funeral. Her death, it, it ruined my father. The day I finished high school he hung himself. How stupid. Let's leave. Let's go away. Together, you and me. Trust me, Claudio. Here he is, the silly boy. Ah, look what I found. Now that is a serious crime. And you're gonna do serious years because of it. Should have just left her alone. It's about your boyfriend. Come. What have you done? Where's ameh? She's saving her face elsewhere. I told her I wanted to speak to you alone. Sit! Where's Claudio? Your boyfriend is safe but gone. You will not see him again. Farouk, please, please. I'm begging you please. It cannot be. But it's not his fault but our hearts. I cannot. You will not. Either way, this is over! Fuck! fucking thing! You are so like our father. You're nothing like him. I should have been there more for you. For that I am sorry. You thought that Allah has taken your eyes so that you can see what you've become. I do not presume to understand Allah or you. My eyes saw the look on our mother's face when she heard of your shame. Really? Perhaps because it came from you. She needed to know. You lie again, Farouk. I'd already told her. Jaiwara, believe me, it is over. Can I help you? I don't think so, thanks. Come on, princess. Your request has finally been approved. You've become very popular. Hello? Hey. It's me. Listen, I've only got two minutes. I'm in prison. I know. It took me days to even find out where you were and then they wouldn't let me through to you. I got you a lawyer. What can they do for me? Look, I didn't even do this yet here I am. Yeah, I'm trying everything I can. Your brother put me in here. I need you to do one thing for me. Anything. Have you heard of a man named Duke? He could help me. Yeah I've heard of him. Okay, find him. Tell him I'm the doctor's grandson. I have to go. I love you Jaiwara. Claudio? Claudio! He's not here, darling. It's urgent. Can't you hear me under that fucking thing? I said he's not here. She wants to see Duke, mate. Come through. Thanks. Would you like a drink? I need to see Duke. Need? That's eager. My name is Jaiwara Nassar. Do you know who my brother is? I know who your brother is and yet you are here. Duke's on holiday but I have his ear and you have mine. My boyfriend Claudio was arrested. He was charged with possession. It doesn't matter. I can assure you he's innocent. Well. We all started out innocent. Eyelash. Do you love him? So will you talk to Duke? Yeah. We can help you and your boyfriend. Really? Thank you. Oh, thank you, thank you so much. One other thing. My brother must never know that I've come to you. I agree. But we're not done yet, Jaiwara. Help, help me! Come on! Oy, help! Help! This won't hurt a bit. Oh fuck no! Leave. Now! Farouk wants you alive for now. And stop. Go from here. The other one. Pause it. You see? It's her, I told you. What the fuck's he doing with her? I'll leave you two lovebirds alone. It's all right. It's okay. It's all right. Did Duke remember my grandfather? He's away. I spoke with a man called Angelo. And what did he say? He's the devil. So no one can help me then. Look, I'll try Farouk again. I'll make him see sense. Fuck your brother! He put me in here! What happened with this man, Angelo? Tell me. He promised your release if, um... What Jaiwara, what? Look at me, I'm dying in here. He said he could help you if he could help himself to me. I pray every day for us to wake from this nightmare. It'll kill me in here. I know it. Farouk has men everywhere. I can't do this. I'm begging you. Do this for me. You're all I have now. Jaiwara? Are you okay? No, I'm not. You know what's wrong but you do nothing. He is not worth your tears. I know he goes with the wrong people. He's innocent. Farouk? Farouk did this. The boy is in the prison, Jaiwara. Stop lying to yourself! You know, you know what your precious son is capable of. Are you gonna bury your head again? Wake up! No wait, no, please. Please. Please, I need your help. Please. Talk to him. He'll listen to you, I know he will. Please. I am only worried what you would do. Not Farouk. Allah? Allah, everyday. Every single day. Sometimes his directions are not clear. I know that my father, your husband, he'd be disappointed in what we've become. And I know what he would do. Jaiwara You're Duke? I am. Is he with you? Who? Angelo. No, no. It's just us. You're safe. You have my word. Please. Every day I see less and less. In six months, it will be gone completely. You have tried everything? Maybe there is another operation. It's too late. It's when I became too stubborn. You, never. How is she? She is upset still. What will you do with her? I will love her forever, always. They are unnatural together. This here is not my home. Our home. And yet here we are. To know what is natural is a luxury that wore off long ago. You'll drive her away from us. And I will be left with a blind and stubborn son. So when you ask me what I will do, all I think is what is it that you will do. And what did Angelo ask for in return? Was it money? He asked much more than that. I just prefer not to say. Okay, but I do need to know. He said I could get Claudio out if I spent the night with him. I'm so sorry, my dear. I knew Claudio's grandfather briefly. But sometimes it's enough. So you'll help him? Why did your brother put him in there? Because I love him. Ah. Well your brother and I have managed to mainly avoid each other over the years, and to be perfectly frank, my dear, I'd prefer to keep it that way. That I understand. So? How are we gonna solve your little problem? Good. I have to get this. Hi. Are you okay? What I asked you, I didn't mean it. I was scared. Forgive me. Please forgive me, Jaiwara. I already have. It's nice to hear your voice. I'm so lost. I despise not seeing you. I see you every day. We're meant to be together. In this life or next, we will be. Listen. I met with Duke, and... He's helping us. What do you think? Brand new. My feet are killing me. Well, you gotta suffer for your art. They're lovely. You know my whole life, I never had anything new. It's always hand me downs. Till one day, my mum, she got me this bright, shiny new bike. It's for my birthday. God. She must have scrimped and saved. These days I can have anything I fucking look at. I'd give it all back to feel the way I've felt that day. That's really sweet. What do you think happens when we're done? We fuck, you come. You hate yourself. We sleep, we wake. This is it, Ange. One life, one God. Or no God. This is it. Hello? It's Jaiwara. Oh, hello. Can you guarantee Claudio's release? I can. How? Easily. You came to us, remember? Tomorrow night. Okay. No one can know. It'll be our secret. Maybe you're right. About what? There is no God. Hey, Duke. How are you? How's it going? It's fine. I'm fine. Duke? Yeah? When you coming home? I miss you. Ah, soon, I'm not far away. You behaving? Yeah. I've been a good boy. Angelo, listen to me, you pull your fucking head in before someone pulls it from you. And is there anything you need to tell me? Nah. It's just... Just what? Just you come home soon, eh? Hey, shh, shh, shh. Take off my clothes. So no problems? He couldn't move a muscle. And Jaiwara? Life. She was only there for a minute, I didn't leave her side. Just close your eyes. Okay? Yeah. I didn't think he'd go through with it. Why didn't you just get the kid out? I left Angelo in charge! I was hoping he'd do the right thing. What're you gonna do? I don't know. I mean he gave up five years of his life. Took the rap for me. And I've been looking after him ever since. I know. And we all cross the line sometimes. There's still a bloody line! There is. And he keeps fucking crossing it. He's breaking my bloody heart! What's going on Stan? What about treatment? Yeah. Not their treatment. Who needs Duke? We do what we fucking want from now on, Ange. This is our town, mate. You all right? You have a big night or something? Yeah, yeah, big night. I don't remember a fucking thing, except, that I'm going to hell. What are you talking about? See you there. If I ever see you around here again I'll fucking kill you, you hear me? You know who I am? Why are you here? Salvation, mine. Yours, perhaps. I slept with Jaiwara. You know it's actually quite impressive, what she did. I mean she must really love you, Claudio. She would never! She did. She couldn't, for her good is the sum of her! Her good is the sum of her? What the fuck does that even mean? Ah, you're just a fucking kid. I know what you asked of her. So she told you. Of course she did. And what did you say? Ah. Yet you judge me. Yet you judge me. Enough. I can assure you, what Angelo thinks happened, did not. Why are you showing me this? Years ago, my wife and my daughter were taken from me by a drunk in a car. They were torn to pieces. But he survived. So I delivered my own justice. My bullets were witnessed by an old man who was a doctor. I got to him before the police. He saw the pain that I was in. And when he was finally questioned, he chose to turn a blind eye. Now here was a man who dealt in life and death but he understood that at times, vengeance is all we have. That boy in prison is his grandson. And I cannot shut my eyes to it. What exactly are you asking of me? I'm asking you to release him. I mean I could do so but out of respect, I'm talking to you. You understand what this means? Angelo is like a son to me. So none of this comes lightly. Do I understand you? Clearly. Absolutely. Your daughter. What was her name? Rose. So, you are free. Apparently not. Someone reached out to me which is why you still breathe. But believe me, if you see my sister again you will die in this prison. Then send me back now. I love her. As do I! Which is why you're still here. If you truly love her then disappear. Never. Farouk! Oh! Oh god! Both of you, in the car! Do not test me! Farouk, where are we going? Farouk? Please, please, I'm begging you please. You don't have to do this. Just look at me, okay? Just look at me. We fell in love, that's all! Please, please, don't do this. Please! - You're my sister. - Yes! - I love you. - Yes, I love you. This cannot be. Out. No, no. Get out! Drive. Easy, Ange. Duke. Good to see you. What you doing up here? Just... Got that for you. Thanks. Drink? Sure. I've watched this city changed so much. I fucked up, Duke. Yeah. Now. I fucked up pretty bad. They're gonna kill me. You need sleep. Do you forgive me, Duke? Come downstairs, we'll sort it all out. Do you forgive me? I already have, Angelo. I already have. You coming? Yeah. I'll be down in a sec. Okay. I'll see you soon. Ah, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Look after my Jaiwara. I will. We'll see each other soon. Thank You
