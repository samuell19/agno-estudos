She was born in the forest. With bones of firm wood, and flesh of fiber, One day, green blood started running in her veins. Kim Ji-hun publishes first novel "Underground" Proposal for Kim Ji-hun's second novel "Underground 2" The foundations of life from the perspective of soil. HONEY - Are you at the airport? - Yeah. When are you coming? I'm gonna stay at my mom's for a while. Yeah? And... I forgot to tell you. I put the house on the market. What? Without even consulting me? It's my house. You just live there. What about me? Where am I supposed to go? That's more important to you than us breaking up? Are you trying to end it with me? Weren't we already finished? What's wrong with you? Just find another place. Bye. Hydrochloric Acid How was your day? What are you doing? She's thirsty. You didn't water her? I don't have time for trees. She wants water. You can talk to trees? Listen. She's talking to me. Yeah? Let's have a look. Don't let it get wet. Thank you. How about... if I live here? It's nice with no stairs. I'm... selling it. What? It's too big for one person. And it reminds me of my late wife. Is it because of money? Aren't you hot? I'm okay. Are you shy? It's still your body. It's gross, right? No. It stopped growing when I was 12. I'm going for a meeting. Okay. Where are you going? A business meeting. I transplanted chlorophyll into red blood cells. A genetic mutation then occurred in cell 1, looking like this. It's a prototype of a green blood cell. What about trials? I injected a zebra fish with synthetic blood, but it died overnight. Next, Soo-hee. I haven't found a topic yet. Are you kidding? You know how important this conference is, don't you? Our lab could be shut down. Let's drink. Have a drink. - Bravo! - Bravo! Sir, your book impressed me deeply. It's a masterpiece... Enough of that. Have another drink. If you don't mind... Would it be possible for me to publish your new novel? Yeah? Why not? Thank you! What was your name? It's Kim Ji-hun. Have another drink. It's an honor. How old did you say you were? I'm 42. How many copies did Underground sell? Following your dream is fine, but writing a novel is no joke. Yeah... If you don't have talent, quit early. Open a bar before it's too late, okay? Honey, that's a bit harsh... It's true, though. - Are you crazy? - Open a bar? A few bestsellers and you think you're king? Your new book's a rip-off of Wang Jing, right? What's wrong with you? Stop plagiarizing! You're just a hack! You calling me a hack? Have you read my book? Who the hell do you think you are! Huh? Look what the cat dragged in. I'm thinking of restarting an old project. This is my proposal, take a look. I'll do a serial novel on your web. Give me a shot. See that? Those are books of yours returned today! Obscure writer Kim Ji-hun calls Lee Chang-dae a fraud. You picked a fight with the wrong guy. Hey. Everybody in this business knows he plagiarized. So what? If you're successful, no one questions you! You're screwed. A new novel? Forget it. In this business? Who's going to publish you? You're up against Goliath. We're nearly there. This forest is deep. Such a nice place. Watch yourself. There. Come on. This way. That smells. The water stagnated after they blocked the stream. I used to catch fish here. Pure things contaminate easily. This way. Wow... Look at that. It's dying. Looks like someone was cutting it. My dad. He was a logger. He stopped cutting because of me. Why? Because that's when my mom died. Giving birth to me. My dad always thought this tree cursed us. Even my leg. He thought it had a soul. That's just superstition. The trees look a bit scary. My dad rescued the dying ones. My dream is to make a garden here. Yes, Sir. Yes... It's just that... We need a bit more time on this project. Yes. I won't let you down. Yes. Yes, sir. Sometimes... I feel like a salesman. Not a professor... Listen... Jae-yeon. I have a proposal. Do you remember my old project? Alternative energy? Yeah. How about... merging that with your green blood cell research? Never mind. Forget about it. Cells after gene manipulation. Signs of photosynthesis in the blood cells can be seen. Were you up all night? Yeah. You're wearing makeup? I felt gloomy today. I have a lot in my mind. And it's so hard to get published in journals. Have you found a new project? I have a few ideas. That's good. Hang in there. Thanks. I'll go take a shower. - The cells are alive? - Yes. The zebra fish died but isn't decomposing. Really? It's a result of the new green blood cell injection. A mutated cell in the subject's blood is producing oxygen. But we can't know the implications for humans. It could be rejected by the human body. The zebra fish has a similar genetic makeup to humans... Still, it's not identical. I think there will be many uses for green blood cells. Instead of blood, how about applying it to something else? Like what? I think Jae-yeon's research is good, but it will take too long to develop practical applications. Our lab doesn't have that much time. Soo-hee, we have a talk scheduled, right? Yes. Let's wrap up. That's all for today. Cheer up, man. Do you know how David beats Goliath? There's only one way. Write a novel that nobody can resist. I think I drank too much. Are you okay? You're wearing a skirt! Wow, looks good on you. Thanks. Hi. Is everything ready for the forum? Yes. Korea's major rivers are polluted, as you see. Reagent No.18 is designed to prevent green algae. That looks more suited for the Ministry of Environment. We started from the concept of transplanting chlorophyll into red blood cells so they could produce oxygen from only carbon dioxide and water. The first experiment led to genetic mutation of the cells. Some of the hemoglobin mutated. I call these modified green blood cells JY, from my initials. Then are you saying that JY can carry oxygen? They don't need to carry oxygen. This is the subject zebra fish. Even after its death, the green blood cells circulate and prevent its deterioration. Because JY produces oxygen by itself. How do you plan to apply this research? You need human trials for definitive results. That will require some time. I see this project lasting 10 or maybe 100 years. Are you up for that? It's theoretically possible, but humans photosynthesizing? It's a project that centers on human life. Even if it takes 100 years, I think we should pursue it. What school did she graduate from? Good evening. My Name is Choi Soo-hee. I have developed an anti-aging cosmetic by extracting chlorophyll from chlorella and combining it with hemoglobin. I call these cells Chlorobin. I received inspiration from my colleague's research into green blood cells. This product is animal-based and has fewer side effects. It penetrates the dermal layers, showing excellent absorption. Not only that, but Chlorobin also has applications for alternative energy. I have worked on this project with chief supervisor Prof. Jung. With enough funds... Soo-hee, meet the president of Biochemical. I liked your presentation Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. It's such a fascinating subject. Let me pour you a drink. You saw Jae-yeon before. Pure things contaminate easily. Cut it out! You know Wang Jing? The Moon's Song. Your new book is a total rip-off! Who the hell do you think you are! You asshole! - I'm as old as your parents! - Piss off! - Let go of me! - Do you know Wang Jing or not? - You're a pathetic young man. - Answer me, you damned hack! Chlorobin - Choi Soo-hee Jae-yeon. Did you touch Soo-hee's sample? It's been contaminated. Why is it Soo-hee's? She stole it from me. We need the original samples. Is that... why you're here? Why did you do it? Do you think my work is useless? Did you see how they were looking at you? Yes. I did. But you know what really hurt? You were looking at me exactly the same way. It was the only way to save my lab. Bye. Your face feels stiff? Sometimes I can't smile. Any other symptoms? My fingers don't respond sometimes. How long has it been? Some time now. My eyes tremble and this side of my face feels paralyzed. We'll have to run some tests, but it may be a problem with cerebral blood flow. It's Sung-nae. How's your new novel going? Good luck. I was born from a tree. One day, green blood started running in my veins. Land tax bill 455 Pyungsanli... Lee Jae-yeon. Hi there. Bring an extra box of tree sap next time. There are more orders. Okay. Did my package arrive? Yes, here. The new face of cosmetics Chlorobin researcher Choi Soo-hee You can't come in here. Oh, actually... I live in your old house. Mail keeps coming and I didn't have your number... How did you find me? You're late on your bills... Can't we open the door and talk? "I was born from a tree." "One day, green blood started running in my veins." It was written on the wall. Actually, that's why I came. I'm not a weirdo. Leave the mails and go.

Who the hell do you think you are? The artery to your brain is too thin. What? Your body acts strange because your brain doesn't get enough oxygen. Not being able to smile, stiff fingers, all of it. How do I treat it? There's not much we can do. It's genetic. Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, junk food. There's a bomb in your head. It could go off anytime. Is the tree dying? What do you want this time? You... came into my head. Isn't it scary living alone here? Well, I guess people are scarier. Sometimes I can't smile because of bad circulation. Your wall collapsed. It's late. Glass Garden: Chapter One She was born in the forest. When green milk dripped from an old tree's bark onto the earth, a baby was born from its roots. With bones of firm wood, flesh of pure and soft fiber. One day, green blood started running in her veins. The baby crawled out, and looked up at the tree with love. She sucked on the tree's sap like mother's milk. While the logger was out, the trees rustled their leaves singing her a lullaby. Her father said that wounded people become trees in their next life. Sometimes she would lay her ear on the bark. All at once she heard the stories of the tree and the forest. In the arms of the earth, river, and forest, the child grew and grew until she became a woman. Looks like new cells have formed. They're more oxygen saturated than the last ones. With a bit of mobility, too. I feel good about it. Synthetic blood using green blood cells October 1st 2009 The day he came to lecture. He stopped with me to look at a bird. He was the first person to slow down for me. We're late again. Hurry! Okay! Excuse me. Where's Building 11? - It's that building. - Thanks. - I'm going there too. - Oh... If you're busy you can go ahead. No, it's okay. Oh! I wonder how she got here. She's a forest bird. She came a long way. She visits here often. She came because she's hungry. Looking at her, J stopped in his tracks, because of the smell of earth coming from her. She went to the city. She made her nest in a university. J gave her comfort in the suffocating city. But every night she dreamed and longed for her forest. Hey Sung-nae. Your novel's great! I put it on my blog, and people like it. Yeah? A human becoming a tree. This could be your comeback. - Good luck. - Thanks. 714 likes Who are you Ghost Writer? I love this so much! When's the next one coming out? Do you have a room? Green blood response test... So your hobby is spying. It's not that... I'm staying nearby a few days for my health. Is this the synthetic blood? I read your paper. I thought it had real potential. Why did you quit and come here? Ji-hun. What is it you want to know about me? My body is stiffening. I feel like I'm becoming a tree. Her flesh was shallow. When did it start? Her blood began to turn green. In the city, she concealed her green veins with her clothes. People found it strange that she wore long sleeves in summer. She told her friends that one day, she'd become a tree. She whispered she knew how to make people into trees. People smiled in front of her but not one person understood her. The project is discontinued. Did he ever love me? Everything ended overnight. I found out too late that his smiles were not for me. Leaves were what she ate. She could live off only sunlight and water. Just like a tree. She endured, believing that one day she'd be born again as a beautiful tree. Then one day she left the city behind. I wish you could be happy. One day, J held her in his arms. At that moment, he felt her loneliness penetrate his soul. She too felt his loneliness. That day they shared their warmth. J felt compassion for hers. It was nothing but sympathy, but for a short while they thought it was love. She knew she would be hurt again, but she loved him nonetheless. What's that, Glass Garden? Look at these click rates! Yeah... Ghost Writer? What kind of name is that? - It's Kim Ji-hun. - What? - It's an alias. - Out of the way. Trending: #2 Glass Garden What are you doing in this shit hole? Well it looks like country life suits you. But what's behind this burst of genius? Good strong sentences. It has potential. I have a good feeling about it. You deserve to hit it big. You suffered enough. You know, I'm sorry. Back then I had no choice. Lee Chang-dae is such a household name... Enough of that. Yeah. I like the subject. A tree human? It's unique. How does it end?

But you gave me inspiration. In your story I don't have a limp. I wanted you to be happy, at least in the story. Happy? Doesn't that character just represent your desire? Just like in your story, this man... is becoming a tree. I want you to keep writing. Show them I'm not wrong. He's dead. He's rotting. No. It's just a side effect of the experiment. I can't believe this... You're crazy. I'm not crazy. I'll prove it to you! Stop! I can't do it anymore. I've seen too much. What do you mean? I met her in the woods. A muse? I'm scared. I quit. What's going on? Did she kill him? Kill who? Who killed who? Recent Search Why did you do it? Why did you do that to me then? Huh? You're alive. I wasn't wrong. I was never wrong. How did you... You said some weird stuff last night, so I investigated. She seems like a real nut. Who's the guy? Someone you know? No... Liar. Finish the story. I can't. What? Did you forget our contract? I'll give you back the money. You piece of shit... What? Backing out again? You're just a coward. You always chicken out. That's why you live in this dump! You... Get the hell out. Shit! How can I help you? Is this the police? Just stop. Pretend you never saw anything! This is a criminal case. If I turn you in, you're an accomplice. I still can't finish the story. She was just a tool anyway, right? You wanted to be famous and stick it in Lee Chang-dae's face. But what's the difference between his plagiarizing and you stealing her life story? You're such a hypocrite! You used her from the start! You prick! Stealing a mad woman's life story is no crime. Write me the last chapter. Just as you saw it. Then I won't report you. It's best for her and best for you. J, the man she loved, was a professor missing from long ago. She kept him locked up in her cellar. She embraced his corpse, and whispered words of love. Maggots crawled out of his body, but she didn't mind. My lovely muse, where did she go? Was she... merely a scientist who lost her mind? Glass Garden "Hot New Arrival" Glass Garden The lady with the corpse. A shocking true story! Kim Hyeon Your call cannot be connected... Glass Garden : Final Chapter Glass Garden ...Was she merely a scientist who lost her mind? True story? Isn't she a criminal then? She's just some crazy bitch! This is the shop. Are you alright? Why? The police are looking for you. They seemed really serious, so I felt worried. Hello? Search for her! You two! Follow me. Yes, sir! "...A true story!" Is it a true story? No, I just made it up. What's this? I think... my publisher got it wrong. You know her? Do you know Lee Jae-yeon? Yes, I met her a few times. This is the body from the crime scene. Do you recognize him? No... I don't. You've never seen him? No, never. How did you first meet Lee Jae-yeon? I went down there to get some rest. I was writing an internet novel Glass Garden at the time. She told me she liked my stories. ...who believed humans could photosynthesize like plants. The police are trying their best to find the key suspect, who worked at a lab until disappearing a year ago. The body found at the crime scene was identified as a professor at the suspect's university, who has been missing for the past year. The police believe she committed a copycat crime after reading the internet novel Glass Garden. For our next story... Glass Garden Jae-yeon... Jae-yeon! Jae-yeon! Wait a minute! I'm sorry! Jae-yeon... Jae-yeon... It was the tree... that killed him. The water took him. I prayed... for him to never leave this forest. His blood runs in my veins. I'm turning green, just like in your story. Isn't it amazing? No. You just have an infection. Don't these trees look like humans? People died and became trees. So will I. Like in your story, I was born from a tree. The story... is just a lie. That lie was all I had. It was perfect except for the ending. When trees branch out, they try not to hurt each other. But... people are different. People kill each other. I'm sorry. It's all my fault. Let's go to the hospital. Your hands are... so warm. I will... I will change the ending. Just for you. But now... it's too late. One day I met her again in the woods. Wild grass amongst the weeds, chattering birds, they all had names, but she did not. One day, her tender bark swelled, the branch split into two arms and white flesh appeared like a woman's breast. White liquid dripped like milk. A branch below sprouted and rooted itself to form a leg. Now people would call her by name. She was, at last, a Tree.
