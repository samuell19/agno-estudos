[music playing] [motorcycle revs] [humming] [clears throat] Unbelievable. What the hell are you doing here? How you doing, man? It's been a long time? It's great to see you. When did you get out? - I got paroled early. - Early? I'll say early. Two years early. Why didn't you tell me last time you wrote? Oh, I'm sorry I didn't write you very much. It's just, you know, I'm not the writing kind. You're not pissed, are you? - Nah. Hell. I got more from you than I did from Mary. Oh yeah. Mary. Yeah, I know. Things change. Yeah. I should say. I hear she's with some football jock at the university. College, huh. You know it's been two years. Don't remind me. You need a place to stay? No. I'm staying at my brother's. It's part of the parole deal his old lady got me. No shit. That's how you got out early. She fixed it up for you? That's right. That's right. Her brother-in-law's a judge down Thornton or something, ain't he? God. Your brother, he really scored with her. I mean she's a real looker. Yeah. She's got the looks all right. Oh. I got to show you something, man. Check this out. I got to show this. You're going to love it. Ready? Woof. Ooh. Incredible, huh? Oh, man. I got something for you. Gold. I've been saving it for a special occasion. [laugh] I can't believe it. Oh, man. Oh, could you hand me that Philips over there? Thanks. [motorcycle starts] Yeah. Now, that's more like it. Actually, you know, it's smooth, but it's just running a little rich. But I prefer it that way, you know. I'll tell you that sooner or later I'm sure I'll probably have to rebuild this. [phone ringing] Hello. No. Listen, you asshole. Don't bust my chops, OK. Well, the hell with you then. You know what. You just go ahead and you try that. Well, look. I told you I need more time. And-- yeah. Yeah, right. Sure. Strictly business. I've heard that before. Goddammit. When the worm turns, nobody's ever fucking ready. Listen, Dillon. I don't want to step on your toes or anything, but you're not in any trouble, are you? What? No. That phone call? It's nothing, man. It's just a couple assholes I did a favor for. Really. It's nothing. You running stuff again? Listen, man. I know that you sometimes think that I don't appreciate what you did for me, you know. I know you didn't have to take the rap for me. You could have smashed me out easy, and that's that. Look. I'm not talking about the past, man. That's history. Putting two assholes in jail for stealing cars is just twice the hassle. Besides, you never would've lasted. You're too much of a lightweight. Yeah. Right. Look, pal. That's Dillon after Matt, not Bob. Listen. Just keep your shit together. That's all I'm saying. Look, man. It ain't worth it. Life's too fucking short. Look. I got a machine shop, you know. I do machine shop type work. I got assholes to deal with just like any other kind of business man. Besides, I got myself covered. There's nothing that goes on here that ain't being recorded for future reference if need be. Get the picture? A security camera. Yes. Getting a little high tech, don't you think? I think you're stepping on my toes. I mean, after all, best way to deal with the worm is swallow it. [country music playing] So how long ago did Frank quit? About two, maybe 2 and 1/2 years ago. Took off for California. One night after breaking up a fight, just walked out the door. Took what was left in the register. Nobody's seen him since. Sends us a postcard every once in a while though. DILLON: Oh my god. California. Shit. Now, that's where I want to go. I mean I hear the women there are just incredible. Yeah. Well, I met a guy from California in the joint. According to him, they're all show and no action unless you got plenty of dough. - God. That sucks. That's just the point. They don't. [phone ringing] Pretty nice, huh. Phone call for Mr. Zimmerman. Hello Yeah. Listen, Rico. You got a problem or what? I told you I'd take care of it later. What? Goddammit. All right. Look. I'll-- fine. I'll be over there in 20 minutes. Bye. I got to go. - What's up? Nothing, man. I just got to go take care of business. That's all. - I'll go with you. No, man. It's not a problem. I can take care of this myself. Really. I'll be back in a little while. You just relax. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm sure. Look. I told you. It's not a big thing. I mean the less you know, the better. You're on probation, right? I'll be back. We'll get plenty drunk. All right. Bartender. Will you give this man a drink? I'll see you later. Later. Hey, bartender, my man. Why don't you get us a couple pitchers here. Make that four, and a couple glasses for the ladies. GUY: Look. When you're talking football, you're talking Raiders. And that's all there is to it. Hey, absolutely. I mean, when you're hungry, what do you do? You raid the ice box, right? Well, when you want a touchdown-- You bet on the damn Raiders. Exactly. What about the Cowboys? [sigh] The Cowboys. Listen. When you want white uniforms and a squeaky clean AstroTurf playing field, that's when you call the Cowboys. They're still the best team in Texas. They're the only team in Texas, baby. You all got something against Texas? No. Except for the fact that the only music that they play in Texas is this whiny "cry in your whisky" shit country music. And I really do hate that music. Kind of makes my skin crawl if you know what I mean. Why don't you go over there and eject that music that's whining in my ears? All righty. [music stops] I do believe I can digest my beer now. [music playing on jukebox] Johnny, don't. Please. Hey, bird man. You're ruining my night with this country squawk. I think you ought to apologize. What do you say? [sigh] [music stops] Apologize? Apologize for what? Living? I'll tell you what, flattop. You can kiss my fucking ass. And if you feel funny about that, I might apologize. But until then, you can go fuck yourself. And I promise I won't watch. Please. Let's just go. Don't worry about a thing, Peaches. Just relax. Let Johnny Boy here take care of things. Don't start anything. Oh, I'm not. I'm just going to finish something. What do you say? MARY: No! Get the fuck off me. MARY: Johnny, don't. We don't have to do this. Oh yeah. We do. Want a drink? Don't. [grunting] Now, that's more like it. MARY: Just quit it. Haven't had enough, huh, faggot? Come on. Come on. [grunting] MARY: Stop it! No. Come on. [glass breaks] [POLICE SIREN BLARES IN DISTANCE] The cops are here. Let's get the hell out of here. - Man, we got to go. - Come on. Now. Come on, Jessie. You got to get out of here. I had to call the cops. Come on. You're on probation. Come on. Come on. Let me help you up. Come on. [sirens blaring] Would you like to produce some identification and a license to drive this vehicle, Mr. Weston? Hold it right there. Get off the bike and pull your hand out slow and easy. It should contain sufficient identification and a permit to drive this vehicle. Hey, did I say put your hands down? What? Are you counting down, boy. You count down in front of me, and I'll have you pulling spokes out of your teeth, you understand? Because I got your number, boy. And it's out of order. Come on. [grunt] All right. Hold the punk up so I can see him. Now, this is a warning. I catch you around the chicken coop again, you'll wish you were behind those bars. This ain't got nothing to do with no barroom brawl, son. You understand? PAUL: Jessie. Jessie. Are you OK? Jessie. Come on, man. Get up. God, Jessie. Look at you, man. It hasn't even been 24 hours. You think this is a dream? I can't look out for you anymore. God, Jessie. I talked Diana into this. I got her to trust you. I got too much at stake here. I'm trying to start a family for Christ's sake. Do you understand that? What did you expect? I expected more than 24 fucking hours. I expected more than that. What did you expect? Well, so nice of your brother to make it down for breakfast. Obviously, he's used to better food than I serve. Come on, honey. Don't start. Oh, and I suppose it's all right for him to miss work today. Skipping breakfast and missing work are two entirely different things. Well, they're not going to be if you don't wake him up. All right. If it'll please the warden, I'll wake him up. Hey, come on. Let's go. You're going to be late. You all right? Look, Diana. He's not feeling too good today. I told him he could stay home. I don't know. Something must have happened last night. He's not talking. I think he took a spill on his bike. Is he all right? Should I call a doctor? Nah. He's OK. But he's in no condition to go to work. Listen. Do me a favor. Keep an eye on him, will you? Look. I got to go. If I'm not there, the plans are going to fall through. Keep an eye on him. All right. I take care of you. I'll take care of him. FRANK: Mary, are you going to eat breakfast today? [sigh] Um. I'm going to take a shower, and I'll be right there. DIANA: Would you like me to have Isabella fix you something for breakfast? No thanks. I don't feel much like eating. My jaw's kinda sore. Well, let me know if you change your mind. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. FRANK: You sure are an odd one. Totally different from your brother. Now, aren't you? I must say you're better built than your brother. But he's got his assets. He's funny and kind, and he lets me get my own way. I've always loved getting my own way. Yeah. Well, sometimes, he's a little too nice for his own good. Let's face it. Sometimes, he's a little naive. My father used to call it stupid, but I always thought that was taking it a bit too far. Of course, Daddy always takes everything too far. Why else do you think he bought us this great big house for a wedding present? Your brother thinks it's generosity. But I know better. It's just an extension of Daddy's ego. Maybe you two should give it back. Then, where would you stay? Look. I didn't ask for any favors. DIANA: Don't take it so personally. We're all just looking for the same thing, a little freedom. A little spontaneity. A little gratification. A little excitement. How about a little respect? [laugh] Respect? That's classic. Respect! I quit looking for that years ago. It can't be found, honey. Not in this town. Not in my family. PAUL: Jessie, come here. What are you doing here? I told you to stay home. What's one more day? Hey, you and Diana didn't get in a fight, did you? I mean, you got to watch yourself with her. She gets a little pushy, but you can't let her get on your nerves. Yeah, well. Look. I'm uh-- I'm not used to apologizing, but, um, I'm sorry about last night. Hey, nothing to it. The past is the past. What we've got to do right now is worry about your future. I got 600 pounds of ready mix over at Dalton's Supply Warehouse. Why don't you go over there and give them that check so they'll deliver it? Take your time. OK. Just get there before closing. Before closing, huh? Yeah. [music playing] What do you think you're doing? You are just too wild. It's freezing. Nah. Nah. Nah. Don't do it. I never know what to do about my hair. I don't want to go to work. I swear. What? Just because you're Miss Wild-- (MOCKING) I want to come. I don't want to go to work. I'll be right back. Been enjoying the view for long? Long enough. Listen, Jessie. I really don't have anything to say to you. Except for maybe I'm sorry about last night. Last night. Forget about last night. What about every night for the last two years? You could have at least sent me a postcard. A postcard? What are you talking about? You know, it took me a long time. It took me months, but I got over it. What? You were too busy to call? It wasn't a cool thing to do. I wrote you. I wrote you every day for over two months straight. And you did not even let me know you existed. What are you talking about? I sent you letters, cards. I must have called your house a dozen times. Your old man said you didn't want to talk to me. Don't. Don't fill me with your lies any more. I cannot take it again. SARAH: Mary, we got to go. We're going to be late for work. Wait. Don't go. Come on. I'll give you a ride back. Come on. I got my bike right over there. Come on. What do you say? Tell Mel I'm going to be a little late. SARAH: He ain't going to like it. Just tell him. OK. - OK. Suit yourself. You haven't changed much. I can't help it. I've been cooped up with nothing but guys for a long time. Well, don't look at me for any relief. I'm presently spoken for. Some present. Who is that idiot anyway? His name is Johnny, and he's not an idiot. Well, your taste has certainly gone downhill. And your life has certainly gone downhill. Hey, Mary. Don't give me that crap. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Besides, I paid my dues. It's an open-ended debt, Jessie. My father was right about you all along. You are no good. You got a mean streak in you, and you're just plain wild. A mean streak? Hey, I was minding my own business the other night, and bang, your Johnny Boy there starts selling me all kinds of shit. I believed in you, Jessie. I wrote you every day, and not one word from you. Mary, I swear I never got a single letter from you. Nothing. Don't. Don't make it any worse for me. I can't believe you don't believe me. You can't? No. I can't. Look. I loved you. I've never stopped loving you. No. Jessie, no. I'm sorry, but I cannot do this. [motorcycle starts] Mary. Come on. Come on. Get on. You all right? I'm fine. [siren whoops] [siren blaring] Want to let me see your driver's license, boy? Is there a problem? You tell me. We weren't speeding or anything. I never said you were speeding. Then, why are you stopping us? See. I promised your daddy I'd keep an eye out for you, young lady. From the looks of things, I don't think that's such a bad idea. Well, I think it's an awful idea. You have no right going around harassing people, pulling them over for no reason. Oh, I've got a reason. All right. See. There's been a lot of motorcycles reported stolen lately, and we're just running a check on those that we don't think are properly registered. It's been a while since you rode this, huh? I'm watching you, boy. Time to settle up the books, Dillon. What? Are you trying to strong arm me now or something, huh? Look. You little rat bastard, I told you I ain't doing it no more. OK. [laugh] Vinny, do you believe this guy? Listen, asshole. There ain't a fucking thing in this town that we don't have our fingers in. You understand? Now, how's it going to look if some schmuck with grease under his fingernails starts telling us what to do, huh? Well, I guess we'll lose a little bit of our great standing in this fucking community. Look, man. I told you yesterday. It's just going to take a little while. OK. You're out of time, biker man. I want the money or the stuff, and I want it right now. OK, fine. I'll tell you what. I'll run on over to Homewood. Pick up all the stuff. And then, I'll reassemble the cars for you. Then, we can go have a spot of tea. Look, man. You guys fuck with me, and I'm going to spill my guts all over City Hall. And then, we'll see who's time is up. Man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Wake up, Dillon. Don't you think you might have a tough time proving anything? No. As a matter of fact, it's probably one of the easiest things to do. It's easy. Easy? I'll give you fucking easy. RICO: All right, Vinny. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I'll tell you what. Let's try a little experiment. You know, like, what's that guy's name? Mr. Wizard. Yeah. Hey. RICO: Let's see how easy it is with a piece of lead welded to your chest. [gunshots] There. Now, you got easy. Hell. I'd hoped this was over between them. I figured he'd get the message after the other night. DEPUTY ROGERS: Well, I thought you just might want to know. Looks like I may have to go pay him another visit. Is he still staying with his brother? Yeah. It's part of his probation. He's living with them. Some sort of deal his brother's father-in-law put together with the probation department. All right. You keep an eye on him. If he does anything sketchy, nail him. Goddamn punks, they got no respect for anything. What's up, beautiful? My guard whenever you're in the room. [chuckle] Sheriff's office. Wanda speaking. It's for you. Rogers here. No. Hold up. Hey. I'm talking to you. What's this shit I'm hearing around town. It's nothing you've not heard before. I don't care about before. I don't want you looking at him, much less talking to him. Especially riding around on the back of his goddamn motorcycle. Why is everything always so black and white with you, Johnny? You know, maybe I like riding on the back of his bike. Maybe I like talking to him. Maybe I even like him. Oh. Oh, is that it? You really like that scum, don't you? Oh great. Just fucking great. Why don't you run off, shoot some heroin, smoke some coke with him? Yeah. That's it. You, him, and his dolt fucking friend Dillon. I heard you guys were pretty good party pals before. Hey, I got it, babe. Maybe you guys get together and like driving stolen cars off. You are joking me, Johnny. What am I supposed to do? Can't you see how I feel? I have not seen Jessie in over two years. I get it. I have to at least talk to him. That's the least you should have done. Listen. Listen. Listen. OK. OK. We have got to take a break. At least until you can see straight. I can see just fine, baby. You're the one who's seeing cockeyed. And if I ever catch that asshole hanging around you again I'm going to kick his fucking ass. Do you understand that? Oh, I understand. I understand plenty. I understand that you are more concerned with who you're with than who is with you. Yo, Dillon. Where the hell are you? Oh my god. You're going to be all right, man. You're going to be all right. Just-- just don't try to move. Oh god. Ambrose Chapel. Ambrose Chapel. Dillon. Dillon. Dillon! Hold it right there. Place your hands directly behind your head and stand up slowly. You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. What are you talking about? I didn't murder him. He's my best friend for Christ's sakes. I just walked in here. I just said you have the right to remain silent. I think it'd be in your best interest to take my advice. You've done it this time, Jessie. You're going away for good, punk. [electric sizzle] [saw buzzing] [motorcycle approaching] Paul. Paul. Paul, listen, man. I'm in trouble. Dillon's dead. - What? Yeah. I don't know what the fuck's going on. I stopped over at his house, right, to see him. Fucking deputy shows up. He's spread out on the ground. I don't know what the fuck's happening. Somebody must have killed him, man. Deputy thinks I did it. - All right. All right. Listen. Listen. Now, let's not get crazy about this. Are you sure the deputy's not dead? No. No. He was just out. What the fuck? What am I going to do? I don't know what to do. - Slow down. Slow down. Now, look. Here. Take this. Come on. - What the hell's that for? No. I want you to take it and get your butt over to Miller's cave. Take care of yourself. And don't leave until you hear from me. Get out of here. Shit. Papa. Why? Why did you do this? I trusted you to deliver these letters to Jessie. You promised me that you would give them to him. You had no right. You had no right to go through my mail. You had no right. I know you're seeing him, and I want it to stop. Now, either you take care of it, or I will. It's up to you. You do not own me. Nobody can tell me what to think or what I want, or what I don't want. I am not mama. [phone ringing] Hello. WANDA (ON PHONE): May I speak with the sheriff please? Yes. Just a minute. Phone. WANDA (ON PHONE): Sheriff, this is very private. Is there anyone listening? - No. WANDA (ON PHONE): Listen. I have some information about Jessie Weston. He's a suspect in the murder of Dillon Thomas. FRANK (ON PHONE): All right. Give me the details. First of all, when did this happen? It happened just a couple hours ago. FRANK (ON PHONE): Is Rogers at the scene? WANDA: No. He's right here. He's waiting for Judge Walters to swear out a search warrant. Do you want to talk to him? No Tell him I'll meet him at the crime scene in 30 minutes. WANDA (ON PHONE): Yes, sir. I'll tell him. And I don't want anybody to pick up that Weston kid until I get there. [knocking] Yes. Is Jessie here? Come on in. Is he here? DIANA: Well, you must be the sheriff's daughter, Mary. Yes. Well, what can I do for you? I'm looking for Jessie. Would you like a drink, child? No. Thank you. I would like to talk to Jessie. Is he here? Seems like everybody needs to talk to Jessie. After all, it's the need in us that make men like him so attractive. He did an excellent job fulfilling my needs. Maybe you'll be as lucky as I was. I'm sure he can fulfill yours just fine. Just don't let his brother catch on. Sibling rivalry can be so ugly. Listen. I don't know what you're getting at. All I know is I need to speak to Jessie. Is he here? Actually, I think he's still at work with his brother. Of course, unfortunately, I'm at a sudden loss of memory for its location. PAUL: That's odd, Diana. Your memory seemed to be working just fine a few moments ago. Is he here, Paul. Where's Jessie? Please. Please. Is he at the work site? I really need to talk to him. He's in trouble, Mary. I know. I overheard a phone call for my dad, from the sheriff's station. Listen. I know he didn't do anything. I just know it. Please. Please. I need to talk to him. I think he needs me. Go wait in the car. I'm going to the sheriff's office. I'm going to talk to them before they find Jessie. And you really think it's going to do any good. Do you, Paul? You're such a fool. You're right, Diana. I have been a fool, and for too long. Don't leave, Paul. I was lying. Nothing ever happened between me and Jessie. If you walk out that door, don't ever come back. You really disappoint me, Diana. Of course, you've done that all your life. [glass shatters] [phone ringing] Hello. Yes. I have some information for you about Jessie Weston. Fuck. [thudding] JOHNNY: Come out. Come out wherever you are. It's the top of the ninth, and there's an upset in the air. Hey, bike boy. Hey, little biker boy. You been riding the wrong side of town, biker boy. We know who you are. And we know what you done. Bases are loaded, and it's your turn to run. GUY: Kick his ass, Johnny Boy. Teach him a lesson. [grunting] Kick his butt. Tie into him, man. Come on. Yeah. Do it. GUY: We got your back, Johnny Boy. [thud] Get him, man. GUY: Yeah. Good hit. He's down for the count. Yeah. Look out! GUY: Come on, John. Get up. Get up, man. Come on. Get up, man. [motorcycle starts] [grunt] [explosion] Fucker! You did it! You fucking did it. [scream] Shit! [scream] I was going back to turn myself in. I figured I'd get somebody to listen this time. What a fucking joke. Man, this is getting crazy. The last thing in the world I want to do is go back to jail. Look. Look. You can't turn yourself in anyway. At least, not right now. Not until I talk to my father. I mean, he is going to listen to me. Fuck. Forget it. He'd string me up faster than any of them. He's been out to get me since day one. No. No. I know what I got to do. No. No. Look. We're going to go back. We're going to talk to him. You don't understand, Mary. I can't. - I am telling you-- Look. I just can't. - He's going to under-- - No! Don't you understand? Your father is the one that beat me up the other night. What? Yeah. His deputy held me up while he worked me over. Don't you understand? Don't you get it? We're not supposed to be together. It can't be. We can't be. No. I don't believe it. I don't believe you. You didn't believe the letters either. But goddammit. I believed you. I waited for you. That's all I've been doing for the last two years. Waiting to be with you. The letters. I found them. You were right. My father kept them from me. I didn't know. I swear. I wrote them. He promised me that he'd send them to you. He promised. He didn't send them. He kept them. He didn't send them at all. Listen, Jessie. We have got to find out who killed Dillon and why. We cannot go back until we prove that you were innocent. We cannot stop until we have convinced my father. Ambrose Chapel. It's-- it's the last thing Dillon said before he-- oh, man. Why'd they have to kill him? Ambrose Chapel. Yeah. When I got there, he was barely breathing. He tried to talk, but the only thing I could make out was Ambrose Chapel. Dirty bastards. If I could get my hands on them. MARY: I know that this is hard for you. But he is gone. Ambrose Chapel. It's a church. Yeah. But what church? Where? Homewood. It's a church in Homewood. It's an old church. You know where it is? Yeah. I remember my mom used to take me there when I was little. Ambrose Chapel. It's a church in Homewood. It was the only Catholic church for miles around there. Dillon in a church. Just doesn't sound right, does it? I mean, Dillon in a church. I don't know. They just don't seem to go hand in hand. So you know exactly where this church is? Yeah. Stop looking at him. Shoot him. Look at this, Rico. Oh no. They couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. [phone ringing] Man. Yeah. He what? Did he talk? [sigh] Don't worry about it. We'll find them. I said don't worry about it. We'll get to him first. A girl. What girl? Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about it. We'll take care of her too. It's no big deal. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What's the matter? Get ready. We got work to do. I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. I was in a hurry. I didn't think to check. You didn't think to check? Great. That's just great. What's the matter? You forget to borrow daddy's credit card? Listen. I came out here to help you. Ah, big help you turned out to be. You ungrateful bastard. I ought to have my old man hang you. You might as well. No. Wait. I got a better one for you. Just tell him I kidnapped you. I'm sure the whole town would just love that one. Wait. Where are you going? You what? You gonna leave me out here in the middle of nowhere? Just turn the damn car around and coast the hell back. - [sob] - Mary, I'm-- I'm sorry. That's all right. I think I'm losing it. What are we going to do? I'm cold. Well, the first thing we got to do is get off this road. Here. Thanks. If uh-- if we cut through here and head back over towards Miller's Crossing, we'll probably get to Homewood by morning. All right. Come on. Let's go. JESSIE: Seems like no matter what I do I find myself in a no win situation. I come to a crossing in the road and bang. I think about the consequences, but I just can't seem to make the right decisions. There are never any answers. No directions. I know there's got to be a light at the end of the tunnel, but-- I remember-- I remember when I was a kid, I used to-- I used to follow my brother and his buddies up here. They'd come up on Saturday nights and drink beers. I used to sneak around in here and watch them. Sometimes, they'd bring girls up here and they'd-- well, they'd get a taste of life. They'd smoke cigarettes and drink beers until they couldn't stand up and just-- just be a part of it. Just be a part of it all. It's funny. I just couldn't fit in. No matter how hard I tried, I-- I just couldn't feel it. Even when they'd catch me and let me hang out I'd take a swig of their beer or a drag off of one of their smokes. But it wasn't the same. It just wasn't the same. It's crazy. It's like-- it's like all my life I've never really been invited to a party. I'm just-- I'm just so tired of not being invited. I'm just tired of not being invited. Dillon was the only one who ever understood. I'm sorry about Dillon. Yeah. Me too. I'm sorry about Dillon. I'm sorry about Johnny. I'm sorry about us. No. Don't say it. Don't say it, Jessie. [romantic music playing] [moaning] All right. I need a few good men to hang tight with me. Have any of you boys seen combat? Yeah. I seen combat. You were at the Gulf? No. Well, then where did you see combat? Reruns on channel 12. What? All right. Look. You guys, just follow me. Shit. I'm leading an army of idiots. All right. Take it easy. Nobody moves. Nobody gets hurt. Wait a minute. It's me you want. Just let her go. [laugh] I don't want either one of you. But I do want a little information. Get over here. What information? What did Dillon tell you before he died? - Please just-- - Shut up. [yelp] Now, just shut the fuck up, both of you. Listen. Wait a minute. I got something you want. If you don't hurt her, I'll give it to you. You punk. If I want something, what makes you think I won't just take it from you, huh? Because it's not on me. I'm talking about the money Dillon owed you. I know where it is. Oh yeah? All right, wise guy. You lead the way. What are you stopping for, man? It's buried right there. Well, then get to work. And you, get over there. [giggle] All right. That's enough. Vinny, get over there and start digging. What do I look like, a fucking idiot? Just fucking do it, man. I don't want nothing showing up but the money if you get my meaning. Get away from me. Smell so good. You sassy little thing. I like that. Just don't hurt me. Oh, baby. That's the last thing on my mind. Ugh. Now, let her go. That's enough. Now, let her go. I don't think that's a very good idea. Do you? - I said let her go. Come on, big man. Pull the trigger. Come on. Come on. I'll blow your fucking brains out. RICO: Come on! Come on! I'll blow your fucking brains out! Jessie! [gunshots] Come on. Come on. Come on. Jessie! Come on. Grab it. Come on. I can't. I can't reach it. Come on. MARY: I can't reach you. He's coming. Jessie. [grunting] Help us. [gunshot] MARY: Oh no. What the hell are you trying to do? You're going to hit Mary. [grunting] She'll be all right. They'll find them. They couldn't have gotten far. Wait. Look. It's a boat. We can cut across the lake. Homewood's just a few miles downstream. Come on. Sheriff, I want to talk to you about my brother. I have some information you might want to hear. He's got nothing to do with this. Listen. So far I've got a dead body lying on a garage floor and a deputy who saw your brother at the scene of the crime. He's wanted for suspicion of murder and assault on the deputy. [gunshot] I cannot believe they're actually shooting at us. Jesus Christ. What are you crazy? [boat engine starts] Jesus. We're taking on water. - Oh my good. JESSIE: Must have been that gunshot. - Looks like we're losing them. - All right. OK. Merv, I want you to stay with the truck and the squad car. Take a walkie talkie out of the squad car and hold on to it. I'll keep in touch with you from mine. The rest of you boys, come with me. What are you doing? Get back. What the hell was that? Come on. So far he's wanted for suspicion of murder, assault on a police officer, and kidnapping. Kidnapping? That's what I said. If you've got something to say to me that will help me get to your brother before a bullet does, you better make it fast. Because I'm not about to lose my daughter to a punk two-bit hustler. Now hold on. Just wait. Look. I'll tell you what Dillon told my brother just before he died. But you got to promise to take me with you. My brother's innocent, and I want to make sure he stays alive. [clink] [car starts] [tires squeal] Hey! Hey! Looks like they went down. Anybody see any body parts? Hey, Merv. You out there? MERV: I'm here. Go ahead, sir. - Yeah. I want you to come pick us up. We're about three miles past the fork at Miller's Crossing. Deputy, listen to me. They're alive. I can feel it. Listen. I understand how you feel. OK. But I've got to report in to the sheriff before we go any further. Look. We're going to drag the lake for the bodies tomorrow. If they don't show up, we'll decide then whether to continue the search. But for now, I need you guys to head back into town. Await further instructions from either me or the sheriff directly. OK. Do you understand? I mean that goes for everybody. Let's go. You see it. I swear it was around here somewhere. Well, it ain't here now. MARY: My mother and I used to always come here. It's gone. Ambrose Chapel? That's what he said. Ambrose Chapel. A church? Not anymore. I heard they put up an apartment building. All right, you boys. You just head on home now. Looks like we're going to meet back here at sunrise to drag the lake. Nothing more we can do now. This is dispatch calling all available units. Sheriff, where are you? What's your 20, Sheriff? Come in please FRANK (ON RADIO): I'm eastbound on 10. What's up? Sheriff, we got a stolen vehicle report at the gas station at Mill Creek Road. Suspects fit the description of one Jessie Weston, wanted for murder, and Mary Dayton, kidnap victim. FRANK (ON RADIO): All right. I'm on my way. Out. Now, this is progress. Tear down a church and build an apartment complex. What the hell is going on here. I don't know. Do you think Dillon had something hidden in that church? Hell. I don't know. Maybe we're too late. Maybe-- maybe he had an apartment here. No No. He lived in the back of his garage. OK. Well, then maybe he was going to move here. Well, if that's the case, maybe he had a mailbox. Look for his name. Dillon Thomas. Dillon Thomas. - Dillon. Dillon. Dillon. Dillon. You know, is that like Matt or Bob? That's it. That's it. That's one right there. Zimmerman? That's it? Zimmerman. - Yup. Zimmerman. How do you figure? What did you just say a minute ago? - Zimmerman. - No. Before when you were talking about his name. You know, you asked if it was after Bob or Matt. - So. - That's it. Don't you get it? Bob Zimmerman. That's Bob Dylan's real name. Bob Zimmerman. All right. [shotgun cocks] I'll take that. And that. Now, I'm afraid you two are going to have to come with me for a ride downtown. Listen. Listen, Rogers. Now, put the gun away. Don't get all excited. We're going to go to the car. We're going to call my-- Now, you listen Miss Pompom Queen of Nowheresville, USA. Shut the fuck up. Do exactly as I say, or you're going to find your heartbroken for the last time. Let's go. What are you going to do with us? You'll never get away with this. Oh, yes I will. Remember you two have already drowned. Open them. Dillon always had a thing for you, didn't he? What was it? Maybe he just had a little trouble paying his bills. You know him better than I thought. Hey, look, tough guy. When you left, someone had to give him a hand. We had a good deal. I'd help him out with a little confiscated stolen property, and he'd cut up the pot. And your two scumbag partners would sell the stuff. Isn't that just sweet? Yea. It was a sweet deal all around until your buddy decided he didn't want to play anymore. He was a chump. He couldn't afford the rent on that garage anyway. See. Me and my partners, we were doing a friend a favor. MARY: You fucking rat. You're never going to get away with this. My father is going to catch on. Shut up. Both of you, shut up. JESSIE: You're not just going to shoot us and throw us in the river, are you? I mean that would be a little obvious if our bodies came floating up with bullet slugs that match your rifle, don't you think? Really doesn't matter now, does it? After all, I've been taking potshots at you all day. Maybe I connected. Both of us. I doubt it. You know, maybe you're right. I just better play it safe and make it look like a simple drowning. Jessie. My god. Help! [gunshots] Johnny! [crashing] Johnny! [thud] Over there. It looks like a cabin or something. Come on. I'll go see if there's any doors or windows open. Fuck that. What is this place? It's Old Man Johnson's place. He comes up here hunting on the weekends. He actually stays here? Maybe he left a rifle up here. Oh, baby. [gunshot] - [scream] He saw me. - All right. Now, listen. This is what you got to do. You got to sneak out the back. And get into town and try and find some help. I'm not leaving. I'll lead this fucker on and draw his fire. I'm not leaving you. I can't. Yes, you will. You have to. It's the only way for both-- - No. Please. - Come on, Mary. You got to go. Come on. Come on. Be careful. Go. [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [shotgun cocks] Come on, you asshole. Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch. [gunshot] [gunshots] You want to kill me, motherfucker. Come on. Ugh. [whimpering] [scream] [sobbing] Please. Please don't hurt me. No. No. Please. Ugh. [thud] FRANK: Oh my god, Mary. Mary, are you all right? I'll get her to the car. What the hell is going on here? He tried to kill her. He had her held up at Old Man Johnson's place, and he started firing. But I got him. My brother, where's my brother? Your brother's dead. PAUL: Dead? Jessie? Sheriff, don't you have any control over your men? My brother was innocent, you bastard. He's going to kill us. Watch out! Papa! I should have figured there was something wrong. I had to kill him. Now, I'm going to have to take care of the rest of you. [gunshot] Ugh. Papa! [gunshot] [gunshot] [motorcycle revs] [music playing]
