And then I was just drinking. Lying in my bed. Sometimes I got up and went to the can or to buy booze… downstairs from the Chinese guy. Chong sold it quite cheap. The taste didn't matter anymore. As long as I had something to drink. This went on for 14 days. Then I slept for two days. I woke up. There was nothing to drink. I went downstairs and bought booze. Suddenly, I felt like I didn't want to live anymore. Just like that. I simply didn't feel like living. I found a clothesline. Left there by my ex. I climbed onto a table, tied the clothesline to the chandelier… and jumped. It snapped from my weight. I must have been unconscious for a while. The police woke me up, an ambulance took me away and I was here. Well that was a hell of a bit of luck, wasn't it, Milan? Who cares whether I live or kick the bucket? You might be surprised, but I would hate to find out that another one of my patients had passed away. You would be the 24th since I started here. I don't know. I thought no one would even care enough to tell me to fuck off. Oh, come on. Don't be so full of yourself. I think there are people who care about you. Yeah, you'd better believe it. Well… what about you? Hmm? I can see you are quite shaken. Does anyone want to add anything? What's going on with you? Adam? What do you want to hear? Anything. -My life story? -Why not? Would it help me? It would not. I didn't come here to chat. I came to be cured. So cure me. Hey! What's wrong with you, dude? Sit down! You look tired. Wild night, huh? Any racy details? Spill! You'd love that wouldn't you? Naughty Kamil… You'll be there tonight, right? No, I won't. I told you I was taking Andrea for dinner. You idiot! Of course I'll be there. -And what are you going to bring? -Whatever Dad has at home. Ok. Are you kidding? All right. Have you thought about where you're applying yet? Let's not talk about school now. I just… if we end up in different towns, then… we might just… We'll make it work. Of course. What the hell Adam?! It's boring here. Do something! Go away, Kamil! You're disturbing. Oh, watch out! Someone fell in love. He doesn't smoke, he doesn't drink. Mr. Good Guy! Romeo! Dude, don't you think that's a bit over the top? You know what? Just fuck her and come have a shot with us! Shut up, man! You had too much again. Go get some sleep. Just go! Fine. Sorry dude, but you know the rules. Enough is enough. Sorry. Hi Sis! What's up? Listen, I can't hear you very well. I'm at school. I'll call you at the weekend, ok? Bye. I was surprised, Adam, that you asked to talk. Do you like her? Strange women are not my concern. Yeah? And what is your concern? Everything. This whole fucking place. I feel like I'm in jail. Bars on the windows, only rules, rules and more rules. You don't understand it. You are missing the point. -Bullshit! -This is not jail, Adam. This is psychotherapy. You can't leave jail. But you can leave here. -Being here irritates me. -I can understand that. I wouldn't want to be here as a client either. Hmm… You just enjoy seeing others suffer, don't you? You know, I came here for treatment and if possible to be cured. I don't have time to do stupid tasks. Yeah, I see. You are worried. You don't know what to do. You don't know what is going on, what we want or why. I'll explain it to you. We want the rules. You must learn how to maintain discipline and order. That's all you haven't been able to do so far. You see, addiction therapy has two phases. First the psychotherapy and then the rules. The rules are to help you live among other people and the psychotherapy is to give you self-knowledge. You have a unique opportunity to get to understand yourself and thus understand other people too. Take it or leave it. Yeah? Really? And you believe this? Yeah. That writing my life story will change anything? Mm-hmm. That by writing a paper I'll work this out, as you keep saying? You'll never know until you try. I don't want to try anything. Yeah… Even at school I almost failed stylistics. Look, I'm certain you can write your life story in a way that I can understand. I myself didn't know how much writing could help me put my thoughts into words until I tried it. Anyway, you're an adult and you signed an agreement to say you'd do your therapy assignments. All of them. -Give me a break. -Did you sign it or not? -I did. -All right, so what's the… Yes? He's here. Yes, it's existential. I'll approve it. Yes. You have a visitor in the cafeteria. I wouldn't approve it normally, but I'm making an exception. I'm not asking for any favors from you. It is not a favor. It's the rules, my friend. It is an existential need. Well, you can go. We can finish this later. If you're interested, of course. Adam! Hi baby. Come here. How are you? How are you getting on? Do you have everything you need? Do you have enough money? Sit here. That's it. Do you like it here? Oh please. How could he possibly like it here? But he can stand it because he is a man. -You just have to endure it. -With your permission. -We don't have much time. -Sorry. Of course. Adam, the date of your preliminary hearing has been set. It is in two months. As I have already told your parents, it is extremely important that you stay here until that time. The fact that your psychiatric admission was voluntary will help you. However, criminal liability… I hope you understand the importance of the testimony of the witnesses as to the progress of your treatment. I mean all the nurses, patients and doctors here. So, to put it simply, the best thing for you to do is to toe the line. Do I look stupid? No, wait, I'm just asking. Do I look stupid? Come on baby. We haven't told anyone you're here, you know? We said you were visiting Klárka in London. Now you have to grit your teeth and get through this. The doctor will get you out of it. That's easy for you to say. You wouldn't last a minute in here. Look! Is the A for Adam or Alcoholic? Oh please. Can you tell me where you're going? To do yoga. Voluntarily. It is the extenuating circumstance, isn't it? So, if you'll excuse me. Namasté. Psst… You got it wrong. Feet apart. Fuck this. I'm not playing the fool here. Wait! Wait until the end and you can buy me a cup of coffee. Hi! Hey! So you got a permit. Listen, did you say this was your third time here? Third time. Voluntarily. What are you writing? My life story. It is driving me crazy. I feel like I don't belong here. Look at those drunken faces. Mine doesn't look that bad, does it? It doesn't now. But it will soon, don't worry. Like yours? Like mine. Look, I need to write. Sure. You know what? I have written my life story three times. The only thing I'm still missing is the relapse. So, if you need any help… I love you. Me too. Hey… don't be shy, man. No thanks, not now. So heavy! I meant the test, Miss, not you, of course. Control yourself, Kamil, before I take your test away. If that's possible, take his too. You didn't study anyway, so what's the big deal? No, I did study for this test, Miss. Why did you start drinking again? Why did you start drinking? Do you ever feel like drinking alcohol? Are you going to drink after you leave here? You know what? When you are here for the third or fourth time, you will be able to write it. You know what's the worst? That when you get out, you'll always come across someone who will offer you a glass of wine or a small shot. "Oh, come on, it's just one glass, it's nothing." Of course it is. Can you imagine me as an abstinent housewife? An abstinent housewife. What a horrible idea. -Are you writing that down? -Don't interrupt now! Did you just write "abstinent housewife"? I said don't interrupt now! Listen, what did you do to end up here? My parents put me here. I see. I thought you were an adult. So Mommy locked you in here and you are just staying? Drop it, ok? You do know you can leave anytime? Is that how it always is? Your mommy ordering you around? Put that in there. Write that! That your mommy put you in here. I said drop it! See ya! What's up, dude? Adam? What's going on? I just remembered how I was drinking in the can and it totally messed me up. Look, that's totally normal. I mean, last week at the meeting there was this girl who told us how badly wasted she got and it made me throw up. You really cheered me up. Gabina, I don't care about any of this shit. Sure. You are totally cool. Except you're lying here like a piece of shit. You know what, Gabina? Go fuck yourself! As you wish, you spoiled brat! Ok, that's it for today. Thank you everyone. Packing? Yeah, I'm packing. I'm done. And I don't want to hear I should stay. Yeah. I was just wondering what happened for you to leave the group. Nothing! I'm just fed up with it. I don't want to tell anyone what happened, how it happened, or even why it happened. Well, if you feel like that you could just say "Sorry, I don't feel like it." And that'll be it. Only to hear I am a sissy who can't read their life story out loud. Even writing it made me sick. Well, if you made yourself sick, that just means you have a conscience. And conscience can be quite a bitch. But when you go through this kind of sickness, you get a chance to learn something. To learn what? That I am 19, potentially going to jail, and the only ones who care are Mom and Dad? Oh, come on. You are not in jail yet. -I'm not. -Well? But I will be. So why should I waste my time locked up here? Because you have a chance to understand what it is to be a free man. You won't learn that in jail. You'll be an addict for the rest of your life, but you can be free the moment you choose to be. But everything was coming up roses… I had a drink. I was witty, fun, and confident. What do you think confidence is? Tell me. Teach me. I will teach you. Confidence is awareness of yourself. Of your possibilities and of your limits. Your way of life has shown you only your limits so far. Why did it happen to me? Well, with your lifestyle the odds are it will happen again. So, you either deal with it now, or you keep coming back. Either you're able to handle it, or it'll kill you. I guess you'll have to choose. Adam? Are you ok? I saw a man tied to bed. He was yelling, he was covered in vomit, he'd pissed himself and… Delirium. Alcoholic psychosis. Did it frighten you? I am depressed. It made me sick! Take that to the group tomorrow and write it in your journal. Adam, you saw a guy who was sick from everything he'd drunk and went insane. With a bit of effort you could end up just like him. I don't want to end up like that! That's good. We'll see. Hey? Hey! The little boy's back? -I heard you tried to make a getaway. -What? That you wanted to leave against medical advice. Bullshit. The therapist sang like a bird, didn't he? -Is there anything you need? -Me? No. Yes. I wanted to say sorry, Gabina. You were right. But I don't feel like analyzing anything. I really don't. -Want an earphone? -What? Well, if you don't feel like analyzing anything, you might just want an earphone. Girls. Where are your parents, by the way? Gone. Gone how? Well, they just packed and left. They founded a company, dude. Now all this belongs to me. But one thing is missing. Girls. Lots of girls. Kamil? Have you ever actually hooked up with anyone? -Sure. -Yeah? It's good, isn't it? -It is. -Me too. You, really? Dude, put that away. It's trash. Dinner's on the table! I've already tried all of them. We have to only take a bit of each so that Dad doesn't find out. This one? Here you go. Good. Good. That goes with it. Shall we go on? We shall. Adam? Come here. What is it, Dad? We need to discuss something. Have a seat. Come on, sit down. I'll ask you straight, so please don't lie to me, ok? We're men, right? Right. Did you take a bottle of whiskey from the study? Did you say anything? Well? Yes, I did. You did. Right. Well, the important thing is we have cleared this up. I can understand. I was no different at your age. -Off to work? -What? Sure, where else? Cool. Good huh, dude? It belongs to Dad's company, but no one's been here for years. So it's all ours. Man, it's an absolute palace. I'd put a dance floor over there. And I'd put a sofa here. Oh man! Look, once a week we wash the stairs in the hall and sweep in front of the house. That's a good deal. So the launch party can begin. A toast to what? he clubhouse, right? To the clubhouse, man! Kamil, call the girls! This is gonna be big. What are you doing? What do you think? Making the bed. I can see that. But why? I'm saving your life. So you won't lose the points, boy. Do you do that every morning? Yeah. You haven't done military service, have you? What? I'm old. But you keep trying! Look, I noticed you have a cell phone. You're asking for trouble. Listen, this is kind of unstable. -Are going to use that? -This is for the sail. -This one is for the basket, of course. -But the basket is here. Have you ever thought about what you'll do when you get out of here? I guess I'd like to go to the sea. -The sea? -Yeah. Somewhere far away. What are you going to do? Actually, I don't even know. There are a few things I'd like to do differently. Like what? Just things. All right. There. That's a big mistake, young man. You're not paying attention. -Sorry, you can put the rook back. -You should pay attention. All right, a dead knight. Look, it's ten to ten. Hurry on off to bed. It's lights-out time. We'll finish this tomorrow, ok? Thanks for the game. Good night. What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. Are you ok? I don't know. Look, Gabina. I've fucked up too many things. Do you want me to fuck this up too? No. As you wish. Would you like to go upstairs? My parents aren't home. You know, it's really inconvenient tonight. I'm getting up early tomorrow and stuff… Today is Saturday. But Adam even works on Sundays. Some other time, ok? Good night. Good night. Kamil? Are you still there? The night's still young! Let's move on! Let's party till morning! Kamil! That's Kamil! Adam, have you been drinking? Bullshit. Excuse me? Nothing. Baby, don't you think you've been partying way too much lately? Everything's under control, Mom. Come here to me. Good night. Your final exams are coming up! But I don't think I need anything like this. I'm not a weak man and if I choose to abstain then I'll abstain. Nobody's saying you're a weak man. This is just a way to help you handle your alcohol cravings safely. -But I can handle them myself. -Don't be so sure. You'll get a permit to leave the premises and then you'll find out. I don't have enough points. -The permit is hardly a reward. -It's a training exercise. You have to do it at least once. We'll see how you do and if your treatment is complete. Moreover, out there you realize that all the consequences are on you if you have a drink. Disulfiram is disulfiram. But I chose to abstain voluntarily, so why such distrust? It's nothingagainst you, Adam. It isfor you. You'll at least get a chance to try various things safely. -Hello, Mrs. Eva. -Hello. -Do you know where Gabina is? -Gabina? Gabina got her first permit for twenty-four hours. So she should be back today. Oh, she didn't say anything about it. Oh. Ok, thank you. -You're welcome. -See you. Adi! Adam. Hey Adam! Adam, hi! Hey. Psst. What's up? -Adam! -Adam! -Adam! -Adam! Psst! Milan, you know the rules. We have to say goodbye. It will never happen again, I promise. I'll be good, really! I promise. I don't know what to do. Give me a chance. I have nowhere to go. -Are you going to kick him out? -Yeah. He was out on a permit. If he'd come back and said, "Sorry, had a drink." That'd be cool. This isn't. But he's sick. He needs the treatment. Adam, this is a disease that can be cured only if you decide you want to. Rules and discipline. You know it so well. Nice words in the community or the group are not enough. Discipline. You either want it or you don't. He will have to look somewhere else. Maybe they'll understand him. We can't save everyone. And Gabina? I heard she took off. I noticed her messing about with you. But forget it. Really, forget it. She would drag you down with her. You don't mean anything to her. All that matters to her is booze. She's completely addicted. There's no more helping her? There is. If she wants it. The same goes for Milan. I'm going for a walk. If I may, I mean. -It's past lights out. -Yeah, go, go. Tell them at the gate that I know about it, ok? Go. Adam. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? You mean, what's wrong with you? Think about what you really want! You still haven't explained to me where I went wrong. He had everything. He needs to work hard and stop fooling around. I can tell you wish your son a successful and easy life. I wouldn't look for mistakes. I think you and your husband did everything you could. n every young man's life there comes a moment when he's beyond your control and your influence on him is minimal. So I wouldn't talk about mistakes. I don't think you wished him all this trouble, did you? We should have kept you on a tight leash. So you think that keeping someone on a tight leash is the way? Well, that's how I was raised. And when did you leave home? When I was 20. And you took care of yourself? Of course. And how is your son worse than you? -Well, Adam is not stupid. -There you go. Ok. Tell me this. -What am I supposed to do? -You can't do anything. He's an adult. I hope this corrective experience will teach him a lesson. Adam? Adam. I think your parents love you, don't you? Hmm? Or not? If there… if there is anyone there. I don't want to do this anymore. Now listen to me, you bitch! I just can't go on like this, you hear me? I can't! I know, I know, I know… Hey. Shall we? Yes. Look! -Hi Kamil! -Hi! -Hi! -Hey! -Hello! -Hello! Good evening, what will you have? I'll have… a coke and a glass of white wine for the lady here. -Ok. -Thank you. Final exams! People! Final exams! After you, ladies. Kamil, where are we going? To see Hamlet! Jesus! -Let's go! -Man. Say something. You're looking forward to the afters, aren't you? Adam, are you looking forward to the after-party? -Because I am! -Yeah! So let's go! A bit of rock 'n' roll, dude! Play something. Give it to me! Hang on, hang on. My Adam got a new car for his birthday. And that's how you celebrate finals! Some privacy back here. No filming! No, I want to! You are not allowed to film in here. Don't Andrea, don't! What are you giggling at? Adam boy! Let's go! Come on! Adam, stop it, please. Come. Come with me. You have a visitor in the cafeteria. Ok, Mrs. Eva. I'll just finish this last one and I'll be there. -Hello. -Hello. Good job. You're looking good. That will help us a lot in court. Thank you. Well. I don't have much time, but we must align the statements. I'll guide you through the whole process. Look, the courtroom… I just wanted to say thank you. And even if it might not look like it, I appreciate what you are doing for me. Oh, you took me by surprise. Never mind. Let's get back to the trial. So, we'll be sitting together. I'll be on your right. You'll be on my left. It would be best if you stayed silent. If you need to say anything, say it to me first, please. That means you turn to me, whisper what you need, I'll reply and consider the importance of it… Well, that's all for today. Good, right? -Yes. It was today. -There you are. When is the trial? Right after Christmas. I think it'd be good to tell the court that you have completed the institutional treatment and give us permission to confirm that. I thought you were going to write a reference letter for me. No, no. Only with your permission, and if the court asks for it, will we prove that you have completed the treatment. But it would be good, if your treating doctor confirmed that you were attending the therapy regularly. I heard you had a group. Yes I do. An hour and half once a week. But we start on time, so it wouldn't work for you. But if you were interested, we could arrange it. I think it'd be good for you. What for? Well, to find out who you are. Why you are the way you are. I attended a group for seven years and I think it really helped me. I learned not only that booze is not bliss, but many other things too. You were an addict? Well… Yes. That's where the discipline and order come from. Mom said you hadn't wanted anything. What didn't I want? You didn't even want cognac. Well, I guess it wouldn't be a good idea. It wouldn't do me any good. The same goes for you. I haven't had a drink for 15 years. Leave the toy here, ok? And tell your parents to keep the house dry if they want you to abstain. Take care. Come visit sometimes. Ok, let's go. We're locking the door. I want to go home. Chop-chop!
