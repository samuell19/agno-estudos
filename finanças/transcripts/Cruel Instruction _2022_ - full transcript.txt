♪ ♪ They're going to kill her in here. She's going to die. Get this door open! We have to stop her right now! Okay, flash cards away. Quiz time. As soon as you are finished, you can go. [bell rings] Hey, goodwill. Who died so you could have those clothes? Look at her, she dresses like my dad. We didn't say you could go. I've got bio. As if. You're dumb as dog shit, everyone knows that. - Come back here! - Don't let her get away! - Going somewhere? - Nowhere to run. What now? [alarm wailing] In the woods we return to reason and faith. You do not drown by falling in the water, you drown by staying there. Let's move it, scheff. I gotta go... Number two. We just took a bathroom break. You gotta let me poop. It's in the rules. Fine. Over there is good. You've got three minutes. You mind? That's your third flight attempt, scheff. [laughs] You know what that means. Sorry, steven. You're gonna have to come get me. [screams] [police radio chatter] Thank you for bringing her home, officer. This won't happen again, I promise. You broke the law today. I told you... I didn't have a choice. They're just silly boys, kayla. We've talked about this. Mom, I told you... Ignoring them doesn't work. Well, then we're going to have to figure this out because this behavior of yours is completely unacceptable. I'm not just talking about today. You've been failing all of your classes since the start of the school year. You're not studying. You blow off the tutor your mother and I paid for. Honey, just talk to us, please. I've tried talking to you but you don't listen. I just... I feel so alone. No one likes me. And I get this tightness in my chest all the time and it just doesn't go away. And I can't sleep. And then sometimes I just, I feel like I can't, I can't breathe. And I just... I want to be someone else. Kayla, you're not stupid. You just need to try hard and apply yourself. Then you can be anybody you want to be. Yeah? Ray? Like you? I should just hide in my homework and not feel anything, ever? Alright. That's enough. Go to your room. Go on! Ray... No, no, no. I'm not going to have this. We don't talk like this in my own house. Go on! Go. Now. She used to be so happy. I just don't understand... - I know, I know. - What's, what's happened to her. It's alright. Can I get some o.J.? I know I'm allowed juice! [buzzer] Does my mom know I'm here? She does. She ask to talk to me? I'm sorry amanda, she didn't. What else is new? I'm here to walk you through your options and talk about what's next. Let me guess. I get my choice between wilderness adventure in montana, therapy camp in georgia... Actually, there really isn't a choice at this point. There's a treatment facility in utah for girls like you. It's either that or juvenile detention. This is what the judge on your case has ordered and your mom has signed off. Girls like me, huh? You think you know me? I don't know you, amanda. All I know is what's in your file. You've been in and out of therapy since you were eight. It's your fourth time in a psych ward. You've been diagnosed with bipolar ii, adhd... Yeah, and my dad split when I was born and my mom's a lying, manipulative piece of work and blah, blah, blah... Guess I'm just certifiable. Not worth saving. Lock me up in another one of these schools and throw away the key. Right? Look... I know these places are rough. I know the things they make you do. And if you were my daughter, I would never send you there. Can't you do something? I wish I could. It's out of my hands. Let me give you some advice. No matter how bad it gets, never forget that you are free up here. No one can take away your freedom of the mind. Utah's your last stop so just keep your head down, stay out of trouble. Just get to your 18, 'cause once you're 18 you can go wherever you want. You can do whatever you want and you can figure out what kind of help you need. To be the person that you want to be. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. I know we all just want the best for kayla. Mm-hmm.You know, but unfortunately this is her second suspension so we can't welcome her back at school without additional treatment. Additional treatments? Like what? I'd like to bring in our outside educational consultant, mr. Davis to join us. Mr. And mrs. Adams, hello. Hi. I've been looking through kayla's file and it's clear to me that she's a good kid. Mm-hmm, she's a good kid. She's great. I'm going to list some behaviors and I want you to tell me if any of them sound familiar. Okay? Difficulty focusing on tasks, like schoolwork. Low self-esteem. Low motivation. Mood swings. Oversleeping. Slow development of social skills. Outbursts of anger. You just described kayla to a t. Have you ever heard of residential behavioral health centers? Is that like a hospital? Oh, no, no, no, nothing like that. It's a school with a whole lot of added help for teens like kayla who are struggling with this difficult time of transition. They offer a change of environment. Get kids into a new and dynamic setting to practice their coping skills. They, they also provide one on one and group therapy with trained and board-certified professionals. Kayla would be surrounded by girls who are all working through the same issues as she is. And the best part is they're all in it together. I have to admit, seems like this would help kayla get back on track, but this doesn't seem cheap. There's no need to worry about that, mr. Adams. I've taken the liberty of checking with your insurance and the... The expense is fully covered. How many times I gotta tell you? Use a goddamn cup like a normal person. When's amanda coming home? She's going to utah. What's in utah? Her last chance. [notification alert] Oh, shit! What's going on? We have some very exciting news, kayla! You're gonna be attending a brand new school. A special school. What the hell? You changed my school and you didn't even tell me? We're telling you now. If I don't want to go? You're gonna love it, kayla. You're really gonna love it, honey. Mom... Please, I promise I will do better. I will try so much harder. You're going because we love you and we know this place will help you be the very best version of yourself. - The plane leaves in two hours. - Just give it a try, honey. Mom please. Oh, that's them. Hi. I'm kayla adams. Hey, kayla! You made it! What is up? - Hi, I'm trent. - And I'm maggie. - Hi. - Hey! That's me. Great! Everyone's here. Welcome, amanda. Gang's all together. Let's grab these bags and hit the road. I'm actually really excited. Why? Well my old school, like... Sucked. First time, huh? So guys, here is the visitor lobby. This is where your parents are gonna be when they come to visit you. And this is our school mascot, bayou. Oh and over here is our student of the month board, including artwork made by the students. [door beeps] Okay guys, come on in. Don't be shy. Girls, welcome! Welcome! I'm so happy to see you. You must be amanda. This isn't your first time at the rodeo, is it honey? No, ma'am. Well, I have a feeling you are going to feel right at home here. And you must be kayla. Welcome to appaloosa mountain girls' academy. I'm miss connie. I'm the head of staff, and you can always come to me for anything. Well, actually miss connie oh, come, come! We have much to do. We have dinner soon and, of course, we want to give you a tour. But first things first, intake. Feel free to leave your luggage right there. Caleb and jacob will take care of it. Thank you, trent. Oh, honey. There's nothing to worry about. You're going to be in and out in no time and I'm going to wait right here for you. - Okay. - Okay. Welcome to appaloosa. Clothes off. Don't make this harder than it needs to be. Clothes off, now. For you. And you. And just over here, you're first. [urinating] Thank you. Adams, this way. [urinating] Thank you. Great. Adams, you'll be up first. Okay. Get your heels there. And, uh, scooch forward. Just move your butt forward as far as possible. Good, good, good. I've never done this before. It's standard procedure. Come on. But I'm 15. Do I have to? Girls like you try and smuggle in all kinds of things. I've seen it all. Come on. Let's just get your underwear there. Okay. I'll put those there. Good. So now you're going to feel some pressure and it's going to feel cold. Hymen's still intact. Good girl. Don't let them see you cry. Ugh, it's the worst. I know. But it's over now so let me show you around. Over here is our pill dispensary. You'll be visiting that at least once a day. And then over here we have the cafeteria which will be serving up some very delicious food. And in here you'll have your group therapy, twice a week, with your unit. We have four units here. There's two upstairs, there's two downstairs. But you will only have therapy with your own. Speaking of... This is unit 2. Everybody please welcome our two new members, kayla adams and amanda scheff. I said, say hello. All: Hi kayla and amanda. You'll be getting your meds later, just helps you sleep a little better after your long travels. Miss harris? You didn't take your meds. I'm not going to take your stupid pills! Dial nine. No, I'll take the meds, I'll take the meds. Girls stand up. Turn around! - It's too late. - Face the walls. No, no. I'll take the pills! It's too late. I'll take the pills. I'll take the pills. [thud] Dibs! This door stays open at all times. Understood? - What, even at night? - Especially at night. Okay, phones please. If you have music downloaded you can still listen. Before bed only. [sighs] First day's always rough. Did you hear that girl's head? Like when it, when it hit the ground? You gotta forget it. But what if she's, like, seriously hurt? You can't think about anybody but yourself in here. I do not think I'm supposed to be here. My parents they thought that they were sending me some place different. Yeah, no shit. The parents never know the truth, that's the whole point. You don't get it. I can't stay here. No, kayla. You don't get it. [knocks] Dinner! You can settle in afterwards. Um... May I please speak to my parents? Oh, honey, I'm afraid not. Phone privileges must be earned and we really encourage all newcomers to have no outside contact for at least a week. It's for your own benefit, just helps you get acclimated without all of the outside noise. But I can assure you that your parents have been updated and all is well. It's urgent. There's been, uh... A mistake. A mistake? I'm serious. I need to call them. Why don't we have a seat and have a little chat. Hmm? In here, kayla adams, I'm your mommy and your daddy and this is my house. And rule number one in my house is no talking back, ever. Understood? I asked you a question. No talking and no moving until I say so. And every time you push back, that will be another week without phone privileges. And if this still continues, you will find yourself in investment. Is that understood? Dinner time! Line structure. Arm's length apart. Dawn, take your hands out of the pocket. [coughing] You need to ask my permission every time you scratch your nose or you burp. Do you got that? Why don't we tell amanda our five free phrases. Girls: Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me. You're welcome. Bless you. Very good. Okay. Taco night! Be glad you're missing taco night. I'll see you around hopefully. Miss connie? Yes? Uh... You came down hard on the new girls. Well, I find that it's best to scare them right in the beginning. Then they fall in line quicker and they learn to listen. Uh, yeah... Adams is in shock though. What is our job here, remember? To teach them discipline. Sorry. Because? Discipline in here equals success out there. That's exactly right. What we're doing is helping them. We are giving them the tough love that they needed and they never got at home. Adams is going to be just fine. Okay. Under your pillow. It's all I could sneak out. Thanks. You gotta drop the parents thing. Trust me. You've been in a place like this? Four? I just loved the first three so much. You think I'm crazy now, huh? I didn't say that. You didn't have to. Gonna want to work on your poker face in here, rookie. Well? Are you? Crazy? In a place like this nobody's a perfect angel. Not even you. That's not what I meant. [sighs] My mom had me real young. Not that much older than we are now and it just messed everything up for her. My dad split when I was born, leaving just me there to soak up all her anger. She's hated me my whole life. She lies about me, says I did things I didn't do. I think she just wanted people to feel sorry for her for having such a screwed up kid. Jeez. That's awful. I'm... I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong. I've done some really stupid shit. My brain's definitely not normal, you know? I've got anger issues. Big time mood swings. But, like, I can't remember who I was when I was little. It's like the chicken or the egg thing. Was I messed up before these places or did these places mess me up? I can't even tell anymore. How do you know all of that? A lot of therapy. If my mom knew that I was in a place like this she'd come and take me home in a minute. Yeah? You sure about that? First centre I was at they woke me up at 3:00a.M. Dragged me out of bed, screaming. I thought I was being kidnapped until I saw mommy there, just watching it all. Hey... You've gotta find something to focus on. Your guiding star. For me it's 18. When I turn 18, I'm outta here. I can go anywhere, be anything, and nobody can stop me. Ten months and I'm free. What's your star? I don't know. Better find one. Otherwise this place will chew you up. Or just fake it 'til you make it. Voice: Shut down! What's this investment place? You gotta listen better. Listen? We're not even allowed to talk. Oh, there's talking. You just gotta be all ears. The investment unit sounds like solitary. They keep you alone in a classroom doing homework for days. It's not too bad. Obs is what you want to avoid. Obs? Observation room. I heard the girls talking about it at dinner. Like a cinder block cell. They throw you in there, maybe with clothes, maybe without. Yeah. Our very own guantanamo, baby. 'Night. I like where you're going with this, kayla. Let's talk after class, okay? [bell rings] Remember, reports due Friday! Kayla... So how are you doing? Overall. I know it can be a hard adjustment. Lots of rules. But you'll get used to it. I hope so. You're a smart girl. Has anybody ever talked to you about dyslexia? Do you know the term? It's a learning disability that has absolutely nothing to do with intelligence. It can just, you know, mix up some of the letters. Switch them around. It makes it harder to, uh, read or spell. Even though you know exactly what you want to say. I thought I was just stupid. No, you are definitely not stupid. Do me a favor. Take a look at the board real quick and then back at me. Can you tell me what word's on top? Cat or cot? Alright, it's okay. It's alright. Next week we will do the full test and then go from there. Okay? Thank you. Good. Um, sir, can I ask you a question? Yeah. Um, do you know about this place? I'm not sure I know what you mean. Like how they treat us. My first day I saw a girl get tackled kayla, it's not my job to supervise anything outside this classroom. But don't you care I do know that there's likely a very good reason why you're here. You want my advice? Just keep your nose clean and do as you're told. Now, I need to get back to grading and you should get to class. Bryce: Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means, it did show unto them marvelous works. The show of their countenance doth witness against them and doth declare their sin to be even as sodden and they cannot hide it. Thank you, bryce. Okay, girls, time for achievements. Anderson, perez, lewis and garcia. Tv privileges next week. Torres and green. You get to go to the library. Uh, scheff... You get a phone call. And adams, let's see here... Hmm. Looks like adams was spreading lies and negativity as she was making up stories that she told her teacher during class. What? No, I... And as a result, I'm sorry, but there are no phone privileges for a month. That's not fair. Everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all. You know, you are a very lucky girl. I happen to be in a fantastic mood this week. Otherwise, the consequences for what you did would be a week on the investment unit. Isn't that right, girls? All: Yes, miss connie. And for upholding the rules here, fry has earned herself a trip to the drive-thru. Isn't that great? Snitch. What did you call me? Get up. Say it again to my face! - Hey! - Do it again, I dare you! Hey. [gasps] Miss connie, don't dial nine! I lost my head. I promise I won't do it again. And what do you think would be an appropriate consequence for that behavior? No drive-thru. And? Investment. For how long? Three days. A week. Go. Now! Stand up. I know you started this and I'm not going to forget that. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You know you are a very nasty girl who thinks you're smarter than everybody else. No, I'm not. Well, it's true. That's why you're here. That's why your mom sent you here because she knows who you are. So, I'd like to hear you say it. I'm a nasty girl and I deserve to be here. Louder. I'm a nasty girl and I deserve to be here. Again. I'm a nasty girl and I deserve to be here. All the days just blur together here. It's freaky. I don't even know how long we've been here. We've been here for three months, one week and two days. How do you know all of that? Gotta pay attention, adams. They want you to get used to this. My guiding star. Remember? I turn 18 in six months, three weeks and five days. That's why I count. I just don't have a guiding star. Well, stop moping around. Maybe you'll find it. Miss torres. Good. Ah, miss scheff. Welcome. Okay. Okay. Harris. It's your turn to share. My older brother, andrew, he... Louder please. We can't hear you. My brother, andrew, has this friend, kevin, and kevin used to come over every day after school to play video games. I would make them bagel bites sometimes when they would get hungry. One time, um, I went in the kitchen and kevin followed me. Andrew was in the bathroom or something, I don't know. But kevin was there and he... Pulled down my shorts and... Finish the share. This is for the benefit of the group. He pulled down my shorts and he jammed his fingers inside of me. And it hurt really bad. And I heard him tell my brother. Andrew didn't look at me for a month. Great. Let's hear some feedback from the group, please. How short were your shorts? Yes. Good. What was your participation in the event? You must've said something to him. Like something flirty to make him think you were into it. Very good. And in what way were you giving kevin mixed signals? Maybe you were trying to tempt him? Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Court him and you will have shackles. Not on your wrist but on your soul. Don't duck under accountability. You are not a victim. Tears are just an escape. Face your flaws. Adams. Let's hear some feedback. This is the third time you've refused to participate in group therapy. I'm gonna have to report you to miss connie if things don't change. [knocking] Oh, I didn't know we were allowed in each other's rooms. We're not. Staff said that you weren't opening up and they offered me leadership points to talk to you. So, you're just here for privileges? No, uh, it's a bonus. I... I wanted to see you anyways. You know, I've been thinking about you. And... Like, how you've been doing. Well, invite the girl in. Oh, yeah, yeah... Here. So, how long have you been at appaloosa? Almost a year. Does it get any easier? That depends what you mean by "easy". I feel like I'm in jail. You have to find things to look forward to. Things that they can't take. Yeah, that's what amanda was saying that I have to find a guiding star, you know, something to think about while I'm in here. Until I'm out. I like that. - Scheff? - [knocks] you've got a family call. Martinez. Back in your room in 10. I think it's pretty cool that you didn't give feedback to ashley. Well, yeah. Poor girl. It's not her fault that that happened to her. No, of course not. Everybody just kind of goes with it here. I thought it was pretty brave that you refused. It's pretty hard to be brave in a place like this. Yeah. Wait for it to ring. You don't dial out. If you dial out, we cut the call, you get a consequence. I know the rules by now. I have to say them every time. Careful. No talk of the past. I know. Keep it in the present. I'll be back in 20. [ringing] - Hello? - Hey panda. Hey mom. - Getting ready for work? - Yeah. I only got a minute. You doing okay? Yeah, I'm fine. What are they feeding you out there? Anything good? Same shit as always. You know I don't like it when you swear. Where do you think I learned it? Oh right, this is my fault. 'Cause everything is always my fault. Forget it, forget it, forget it. Um... How's jason? Uh... Jason's doing fine. He's outside skateboarding near every chance he gets. A little tony hawk. He wears a helmet and pads, right? Of course he does. God. You really think I'm a terrible mother, don't you? I was just asking. Because raising kids is so easy. Can't wait 'til it's your turn. Okay, um... How's what's his name... Steve? Long gone. He split last month. Sorry, mom, I... I knew you liked him. Yeah, you don't know nothing about anything. Liking someone ain't enough. Look, I gotta go. Okay? So... Stay out of trouble. - I miss you... - [dial tone] seems like you and your mother have a history. I love my mother very much. You know, I used to be mad at my mother all the time. Was she mean to you? I thought so at the time but then I grew up and I realized she was just trying to help me. Just trying to make me stronger. Like a 'break you down, build you up' sort of thing. You are a very smart girl. And I am sure that all of our rules here drive you crazy. But if you just follow the rules, every last one of them, you are going to make it out there. You really believe that? I do. Room checks! Lights out in 10. Hey, that's for me. Ow! Do you think I'm blind? I forgot it was there from class! Did I give you permission to speak? You just asked me a question! And you have just gotten yourself some time on the investment unit. Go! You don't seem very happy, kayla. Happy? How could anyone be happy in a place like this? Why don't you tell me about the school you were at before. It sucked. I was failing all my classes and these boys used to bully me, like, every day. And what did they say? Made fun of the way I dressed. Called me stupid. Did you tell your parents? I tried. And? My step-dad said to ignore them because 'boys will be boys'. And my mom's... Tell me what you're feeling. I feel like no one believes me. I tried to tell my teachers that I see letters, um, different, and then they just said that I wasn't trying hard enough. My mom was just like, "maybe the boys are just flirting with you." "Did you ever think about that?" It was like I tried to tell the adults in my life what's going on and then they just think that I'm some liar. I'm like a sneaky little liar and then I come here and oh, my god, everyone's constantly telling me that it's true. That I am an addict, that I am a liar and that I'm just a bad person. And then... Then I'm just, like, scared. I'm just, like, so scared that maybe... Maybe deep down they're right. Maybe my parents shouldn't believe me. Maybe I am a terrible person. Thank you for telling me how you feel. You don't think I'm bad? No, kayla. I think you're having trouble processing everything you're feeling but you're doing the best you can. And I'm going to help you. If you let me. Teacher: Starting with the line segment already provided. We're going to continue constructing our polygon using a series of similar edges. Now, measuring from... [screams] Teacher: Dial 9, dial 9! Security needed in classroom 4! Security in classroom 4! Class: Booty juice! Booty juice! Booty juice! Booty juice! Booty juice! Booty juice! Teacher: We need the nurse to the math class right away! I just want everyone to know that green is going to be just fine. She's in the nurse's unit and she'll be back soon. It looked much worse than it actually was. Permission to speak. Yes, torres? What about lindsay? Fry is cooling off in observation. Now, onto achievements. Harris: Gym. Torres, mcdonald: Tv. Adams...

And yet you don't know what booty juice is after five months. Okay. Well, like, I've heard the girls talk about it. Haldol. It's an antipsychotic and sedative. Knocks you out stone cold. Oh, you've had it before? Yup. Shoot you right here. That's why they call it "booty juice". That can't be legal. Girl, you've been paying attention, all this ain't legal. Yeah. This is the longest I've gone without talking to my mom. Well, then relax and enjoy. Why can't I talk to them in private, like amanda does? Well, remember everyone here is on a different timeline. And the staff determines if you've earned that privilege, not me. But let's start here and if all goes well I'm sure you'll have your private phone time soon. Okay. [ringing] Hello mr. And mrs. Adams. This is doctor jameson, we spoke last week. I have kayla here with me and she's very eager to say hello. Mom? Hi honey! It feels so good to hear your voice. Yours too. Hi kay. Hey ray. We've been trying to get in touch with you for a while, honey, but I guess somebody's having too much fun to talk, huh? Mm-hmm. Here at appaloosa it takes time for the students to earn phone privileges. They're each on a different path. Well, what you been up to? You been horseback riding yet? Uh... No. Swimming? You gotta get in that pool, girl. Summer's almost done! Get in that pool! Honey? Is everything okay? Mom, you gotta come get me. It's terrible here. They give us these pills, they scream at us, and this girl got stabbed! By a yes, it's doctor jameson. I'm very sorry but as we warned you last week, kayla is concocting these stories to try to manipulate you. To make you feel guilty so you'll come get her. No. No one was stabbed. There's no need for concern, really. This is a common tactic. The important thing is we stick to the program. Now, kayla is doing very well here. She's taking time to adjust to the full program but that's completely normal. Thank you. I'll check in next week. Kayla, I'm very disappointed in you. Now, if you promise never to do anything like that again I won't tell miss connie.

You were a warrior today. You're my guiding star. - I should go. - Bye. So, you're doing better, honey? Yup. Doing great. Ray: How are those classes going? Kayla is doing very well, especially in algebra. Oh, I like the sound of that. Oh, and we did this ropes course and I helped all the girls in my unit climb this really big wall. Sounds impressive! Unfortunately there is something we all need to discuss. Something quite serious. Do you want to tell them or should I? Tell them what? Honey, what's going on? I'm sorry to tell you that your daughter is engaging in homosexual activity here at appaloosa. We're not sure how long it's been going on but she is in some kind of relationship with another girl. That's not true! She's just a friend. There's been a mistake. I don't know what to say. I'm telling you mom, nothing... Kayla is exactly where she needs to be. This is a psychological disorder and we can begin treatment right here, right now. Now, we'll discuss this more at the next session. It's nothing we can't figure out. Many girls have struggled just like kayla. They all found their way with jesus's love. Stop looking at my body, pervert. I wasn't looking at you. [blows whistle] Martinez... You're transferred to unit 3. You have 10 minutes to pack your stuff. I'll meet you upstairs. Now! Let's go! Everyone will forget about it soon. It'll all blow over, just give it time. You could write to each other. I'll help pass notes. Have you ever been in love? No. I don't think I can do this without her. She was my guiding star. Honestly, you sound like a kid. We won't be in here forever. There's a whole world waiting for us out there. Voice: Shut down! Hey... It'll be okay. [screaming] help! Help! Help! Help me! Only you control what's in your mind! That's your freedom! Don't give it away, kayla! Do you hear me?! Hold her up! She's still breathing. Girls, get back in your rooms. She put herself there. She won't talk. I know what this is. You want attention, plain and simple. If you think I'm gonna let you sit here and soak up all this attention, think again. If you want to throw a pity party for yourself you can do that in obs. Amanda: You gotta find something to focus on. Your guiding star, remember? What's your star? It's me. It's inside me. [laughs] Miss connie? How long should we keep adams in obs? Until I tell you to take her out. Spit it out, trent. What if she was really... Should we call her parents? Are you kidding? They would take her out. Yeah, but... The educational advisor at her school sent her here and we paid him for it. And now there's at least six months left on her parents' insurance and that's how we are able to offer this service to these girls. Yes, ma'am. You're a hard worker. I hired you with only a ged. Isn't that right? Adams, poor girl, she had a lapse in judgement and I feel for her. I really do. That'll be all, trent. Miss adams... Your back. We missed you the last two weeks. Excellent. [crying] I'm not seeing what I think I'm seeing. Ma'am? I have been very clear with the staff. I don't ever want to see that kind of conduct. Understood? Yes, ma'am. I want you to keep an eye on adams. Ever since she came back from obs she's been willful. I don't like it and I don't think it's good for the others. Keep her off balance. I'm worried about you. I'm fine, it's okay. Really and truly? Really and truly. Hey, I just want to say something. Look at me. Look at me. What? There is nothing wrong with being gay. Hey. I love you for exactly who you are. Don't change for anybody. Hmm? And I have something for you. ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ [laughing] ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear kayla. ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Okay. The candle's dripping. Better make a wish fast! What'd you wish for? You know I can't tell you that. Rude! [laughing] look at these wrinkles. Lazy! Make it again. Yes, ma'am. Well? I guess I can tell you what I wished for since it wasn't a real cake. Rude. [laughing] I wished that we could get in a car, just you and me, and we can just... Take off. Where we going? Oh... Anywhere we want. It's an open road. [laughs] It's kind of a lame wish, adams. What? Dream bigger! I mean, please tell me it's a sexy red convertible we're driving off into the sunset in, thelma. Okay, let's get some feedback. Torres? You've got anger issues. You don't even try to get better. It's like you're more comfortable in here than you are out there. It's really sad. Okay, great! Gives you a sense of what you need to work on. Who's up next? I'll go. Adams. Yeah, excellent! Way to volunteer. You act like you don't belong here. Like you're better than everyone. Like your shit don't stink. No one feels safe around you 'cause we know what you're really thinking. You're a pervert and if you ever try to touch me... No threats, please. We're giving adams feedback on what she can improve about herself. Okay, my feedback is to ask god to straighten you out. Literally. [coughing] She's doing it on purpose. [coughing] Adams! Your family are here for you. [coughing] Maggie: Let's not keep them waiting. Kayla is doing so well in all of her classes. We couldn't be more proud of her. Thank you. You know, in the brochure it said that there was a heated swimming pool? Oh yeah, it is, uh... Under construction for the winter. So, let me show you where you can have a little time together. Just right through here. - Yeah! - Yay! - Happy birthday, sweetheart. - Thanks, mom. 16. I can hardly believe it. I know. We want you to know how proud we are of you. I've been making up lots of ground and learning emotional coping strategies for when I'm back at school at home. You know? Mm-hmm, yeah. Um... You know, um... Why don't we stick to what's been working? Mmmhmm. Nice to see your parents? I guess? Do they know about? Not a clue. No. At least they came to see you. I don't even know what to say to them anymore. You know, like, they don't trust me to tell the truth and I don't trust them to believe me. And then we're all just sitting there, playing pretend. I hate to break it to you but we're all just playing pretend. What, you don't think so? No, I... I just love it when you randomly say something really wise. It's like yoda. [yoda voice] give up, do not. Free soon, you shall be. Yes, mmm. You're a freak. Junk on the bunk! Now? Now. Just a bra, bryce. What, you think her parents put drugs inside the birthday cake? Standard procedure after a visit. Hey, bryce. You know I turn 18 in three months and eight days. [giggling] I don't give a rat's ass. I'm gonna miss you, bryce. No talking. It's shut down. Good night. I'll miss you. Like, so much. Don't start. February 22nd is a long way off. Go to sleep. Here we go. And no talking during the movie. ♪ Popcorn or candy. Popcorn with lots of butter. Coke or sprite? I mix them together. Eww. [coughing] Hey! Hey! Out! - Out. - Turn it up. [coughing] [coughing] [coughs] Did I give you permission to cough? No. You know the rules, scheff. Would you like us all to wait until you ask? [coughing] If you make one more sound without my permission you will be headed off to investment. She's clearly sick and needs help! What is wrong with you? Who asks permission to cough? If you learn the rules in here, out there, the rules will be easy as pie. And thank you so much for volunteering to take scheff's place in investment. You may go. Adams, you keep this up and I promise you I will transfer you to another unit. Okay. It's hot dog night. [stifled cough] Well, I've been coughing a lot lately and my chest feels really heavy. Like it's full of something. And at night it hurts so bad to breathe I can barely take a breath in without coughing. Mmm. You're fine. Just drink more water. Nurse patty, something is really wrong. I can tell. Oh, you can tell? Are you a doctor now? I need help. I'm spitting up blood. Okay. You may have the start of a low-grade fever. Go rest up in your room. You can take the rest of the day off class. That's it? That's it. Should do the trick. [whimpering] Oh, my god, amanda! Oh, my god. It hurts to breathe. We need to get you help. [coughs] Okay, um, tell me your mom's phone number. She won't believe you. And how are you going to get near a phone? Don't worry about that, okay? 8-4-3, 4-5-5-5. I swear on my life that I'm going to get you help. Your life, huh? Yeah, it means something that I... It means something and it's because of you. Don't get all sappy on me, adams. Adams, get your stuff. What? Why? You're being transferred. Why? I warned you. You need an attitude adjustment and you're going to do it in unit 4 without your friend. No. No? I'm not leaving here until she gets help. We need staff in unit 2, room 47. You're a monster. You know that she's sick and you do nothing about it! - Come on. - Do not touch me, bryce! - Come on, let's go. - Do not touch me, bryce! No! No, no, no! - No! No! No! - Come on! [kayla screaming] no, no... You're not gonna get another newbie to influence. Sleep it off. I am so glad you're my new roommate. The girl before you just cried all the time, like a little baby. Wait, why are you putting on your shoes? Uh... Hello? What are you doing? We're not allowed to leave our rooms. You know what? You talk too much. Hey! What are you doing? Okay, I don't, um... I don't have time to explain but amanda's like really, really sick. And I just, I need to get her help. Okay. What can I do? [coughing] Here is the gum and paperclip. Thanks for doing this. I'm happy to help. Screw this place. Yeah. [screaming] Help me! Help me, please! Nurse to unit 2, room 47. Nurse! [gasping for air] Take her temperature, okay? I... I... Ok. Amanda? Amanda? - Yeah. Drink this. - Oh, my god, it's 104. Guard: I found her! Security to the phone room. It's going to help you. - Shouldn't we tell her parents? - I can't breathe. She's a flight risk, have you seen her file? We just need to get her fever down so help me get her up. And then follow me. Okay. Oh, come on. - Got her? - Yup, got her. Got her. Okay, follow me. I need my mom. [gasping for air] I need my mom. [ringing] Right inside. Okay. Set her down. Okay. Maggie: I still think we should call her parents. We just need to get the fever down. Ms. Scheff! Oh... They're going to let her die in here! Please! No! She's going to die! Please, no! No! No! No! No! No! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Is she secure? Yes, she is. Don't you... No. No. [gasping] [intercom beeping] Ms. Scheff is on the line again. Ms. Scheff, hello. I would love an explanation as to why somebody was calling me late last night, screaming about my daughter dying? And why it's taken me hours to get through to you. I am so sorry. One of the students got into the phone room last night. They're just trying to cause as much trouble as possible and making things up to get attention. Well, she certainly got mine. I can assure you ms. Scheff, amanda is doing just fine. I would like to talk to her. Unfortunately, she is in group therapy at the moment and it is not possible to take her out in the middle. Well, then have her call me when she's done. Um, amanda has a very full day. So perhaps she could call you later this week? Look, I know my kid ain't no angel, alright? But what kind of a school is this that I don't get to talk to my own kid when I want to? Put her on the phone... Now! I'm sorry ms. Scheff, it's just not possible. Well, then I am getting on a plane and I'm coming out there. I don't know what you're up to but if you won't let me talk to my daughter then I am coming to her. And if she's not okay when I get there, you better believe that I am hiring a lawyer and I'm suing the ever-loving shit outta you. Only family in the vehicle. I am the closest thing that she has to family right now. She's like one of my own. All my girls are. Then how'd you let her get so sick before calling for help? These girls fake being sick all the time. You wouldn't even know. And this one? She is a flight risk. You can't come. This is your fault! Why didn't you tell me she was this sick? We did. You said she was faking. And now I have a parent who's on their way here, threatening a lawsuit. You'd better hope that she was faking it or all of you are fired. Every last one of you! Left lung has collapsed. Someone contact the family. Please. Just tell me, where is she? You know I'm not allowed to. Please! Is she in the hospital? Is she okay? I don't know! I don't know. But I'll... I'll tell you when I hear something. Organs are failing. Oxygen's at 70. [heart monitor flatlining] She's going into v-fib. Get the crash cart. Charge 200. Don't give up. We can make it. We can make it. I'm giving her 10cc epinephrine. [gasping] Trent: Kayla. I have good news. The doctors say she's going to be okay. [sobbing] - Hello. - Hi. Okay. Looking good, miss amanda. Keep taking it easy, you hear? Yes, sir. Thanks, eli. I'm so sorry, amanda. I know you probably don't believe me but I didn't know. I just... I just didn't know. I know, mom. You know now. Hey buddy. You wanna take grandma and grandpa and go find some of that green jell-o for mom? Yeah. I know, mom. Oh, my goodness. Amanda, look at you! Who let you in here? I'm here on behalf of everyone at appaloosa. We heard that amanda was doing so much better and we just can't wait to have her back. Is that a joke? A joke? Why would I joke about... We just all really miss her. My daughter is never stepping foot in that place again. Do you hear me? You almost killed her! I will come back when you've had a little bit of rest, okay? Miss connie? Yes, my dear? Permission to speak? Honey, you don't need my permission, you can speak any time you'd like. Thank you. Sorry. Excuse me. You're welcome. And screw you. Okay. ♪ [chattering] Jason, go play outside, okay? Ugh! Whatever. They said no unnecessary movement. It's just a video game. You're treating me like a baby. Well, that's because you're acting like a baby. You sure that's her? Pretty sure. Wait, mom... I need you to help me talk to her. But I don't even know the lady. You know how you didn't want to believe me at first? Kayla's mom's not going to either. That's what appaloosa does. They train you not to believe us. Uh... I don't know. She will listen to you! Can you talk to her, mom to mom. Please? You've been here so long we might as well move your bed in here. Sounds good to me. You know, I do care about you girls. And I care about amanda. You would've let her die. And for what? Insurance money? I made a mistake. I should've called the doctor much sooner. You know, I think I figured out what I wanna do when I leave here. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I've narrowed it down to three choices. A teacher, an engineer, or lawyer... So I can shut places like this down. Ray! Come upstairs, now! Ray: Baby, it's the fourth quarter, I'll be up in a bit. Come upstairs, now! I'm not going to ask you again! We're leaving and you're driving. What's going on? I'll explain in the car.
