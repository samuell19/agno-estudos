We're gonna make an exception. But it doesn't count. Go, go. Surprise! Surprise! What are you doing? Well, it's chocolate chocolate marshmallow. I'm on a deadline here, Fanny. We thought you could use a little break. Sweetheart, I'm in trouble here. I've got three hours to write this column. I don't have a clue. It's in there. I know it's in there. We could talk about it. Free associate? I could take notes. [SIGHS] Is this really chocolate chocolate marshmallow? Yep. How can you love me? I'm so weak. Oh, it's not easy. [ALL LAUGHING] [TCHAIKOVSKY'S "DANCE OF THE SUGAR PLUM FAIRY" PLAYING] Lovely. FANNY: Jeté away over here, baby. Oh. Ooh! Did I do good? That's good. Diana, I'll tell you something. Weddings can be overdone, and Christmas can be overdone, and whole apartments are overdone. But there's one thing that cannot be overdone. There is no such thing as too much birthday. Hear, hear. Hear too. All right, kids. Back to work. Up and at 'em. Would you like a scalp massage? Scrambled brains with plum sauce? No. Actually, you've given me something much more to the point. Mm? An idea. [BLOWS] [GROANS SOFTLY] I'm going for the early edition. You wanna come? [FANNY GROANS] What a view. FANNY [KNOCKING]: Cella. Cella! Listen, I made coffee, and Diana, she'll sleep another half hour. Why am I doing this? But if she should wake up-- Yeah, yeah, yeah... Ooh. There you go. Let's see. Okay, "Manhattan Diary. Phillip Conlon. The man was convinced the time had come--" No, not here. The monument. The monument. Yeah. "The man was convinced "that the time for celebrating was long past. "What mattered, he knew, or thought he knew, "was the measuring of tasks, victory by quiet victory. But his wife was not convinced, nor was she quiet." Oh! "There is no such thing, she announced, as too much birthday." [LAUGHS] FANNY: "And she proceeded to take the man "to a place where celebration was in the very air he breathed "and the arms that wrapped him round. The tasks, it seemed, would have to wait." No such thing as too much birthday, huh?Yeah. You're a regular walking greeting card. Okay, fine. No. What'd I say? Look, I know this is not fashionable, so please keep this to yourself. But I happen to be very proud of my husband. Okay. Great. He's got his column. Wonderful. Maybe you need something that's, you know, yours. Didn't you tell me you studied acting? What's that got to do with anything? Finish this. Gotta go. No. Listen, if we're still friends, Friday, would you watch Diana? We have a dinner. Just bring me some of that birthday cake. Heh. Okay. [AIR BRAKES HISS] [CHUCKLES] DOORMAN: Good evening. FANNY: Good evening. PHILLIP: Good evening. Cornaver doles out these invites very carefully. Guess my little column's heating up. Of course it is. I own stock. What are you gonna talk about? What do you mean? There's gonna be some heavy hitters here. So? Well, you have to work to hold your own with this crowd. Helps to have a few little jewels in your pocket. You don't wanna ramble on, sweetheart. I don't ramble, sweetheart. Tell the Anastocias. Oh, you tell it. I'll just wing it. Good evening. Good evening. Darling... Oh, thank you. And above the headboard, a little framed notice barely large enough to read, "Nobel Laureate dreamt here." [ALL LAUGH] Well, it usually takes us until the first day of rehearsals to get our New York armor on. Wouldn't you say, Neil? Oh, quite. Oh, and if you're here long enough, you become a superhero. Oh, yeah. That's the deal. I mean, everyone here develops their own special super skills, guaranteed. For example, I look fairly normal, do I not? However, I can at will sprout these little suction cups that hold me to the ceiling of the subway during rush hour. Or I can reach across the deli counter at Zabar's to get that last piece of bratwurst. Tell me, Fanny. What do you do when you're not sticking from ceilings, I mean? [LAUGHS] I'm an actress. I act. Do you really? Are we on the same track here? We most certainly are. Neil's in charge of our auditions. Marvelous play, first major revival. I'm thinking we should see her for Pamela. Yes. Or Kim. Splendid. Well, will you take a run at it? Sorry. What you meant to say, Fanny, was that you "act" as if you're deliriously happy being married to a self-involved blowhard like me. I beg your pardon? Well, Fanny's not actually an-- Actually, Fanny would be delighted. Fine. We'll send the script tomorrow then. That would be great. [SPEAKING IN ITALIAN] You've got it all wrong. I was just trying to protect you. Do you have any idea who this guy is? He is probably the most important living director in the British theater. Oh, well then, of course I need protection. How stupid of me. This is not your league, Fanny. You took some classes. You did some off, off Broadway. But why risk being hurt like this? To remind myself I'm still here. [SCOFFS] When he sees you, does he have a boyfriend? I'm just going to audition. An audition for these guys? These are killers. These people will have you for breakfast. WOMAN: Fourth time, going back. Ready? Fanny Conlon. Fanny Conlon. Yes! Yes, I'm here. You won't believe what happened to me. Oh, I might. Well, I'll tell you what happened. I opened the closet door and this water came gushing out. I mean, gushing. It was everywhere! I was like being in a cartoon. Everything was soaked. What is the logic, I ask you, of putting water lines in a closet, huh? Anyway, so I've got 20 minutes to get here. And so I break down and I called Otto, our superintendent with the invisible friend. Yes, I swear to God. We have a superintendent who hallucinates this helper, Fritz. His name is Fritz. It's never simple, is it, Pamela? You love someone for all the wrong reasons, then you marry them hoping that you turned them into the right reasons. Is that how it goes? I never stopped to take the inventory. I just fell in love with you. Please don't. Oh, don't worry. I won't become your old problem, your reliable complaint for the boys. No, I may be crazy in love with you, but I bloody well know a good exit line when I hear one. PHILLIP: Bravo, both of you. Oh, heaven. God. When do you do it for Cetoni? I don't. I blew it. Anxiety attack. Oh, darling. I'm sorry. Oh, it was ridiculous. It's pretty stupid stuff, Mommy. Really. Yeah? I liked you much better when you played Big Bird or Daffy Duck. I like you when you play you. Well, what's a part without feathers, huh? DIANA: Exactly. [AS DAFFY DUCK] Someone somewhere will need some tickling. Mommy. Yes. [♪♪♪] [DOOR BELL JINGLES] Hiya, Sid. Hey, Mrs. Conlon. So I'm reading about you every Wednesday now, huh? Who is she? You know "Manhattan Diary"? She's the wife. You are kidding? No. She's the wife? Yeah. You're the wife? That's me. See? [LAUGHTER] A picture for the window, huh? The whole family. WOMAN: Excuse me. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] WOMAN: That's her. It's her. That's the one. I was impressed. That's Fanny. So, Fanny. Yeah? Your life must be pretty interesting these days... with your husband's column. The column's doing very well, yeah. Doesn't it make you really self-conscious though? I mean, every word that comes out of your mouth, everything you do, like instant quotation. All your stuff's out there in public. I mean, what do you have left? Mommy! Mommy! Hi. Diana, hi. Come on, kiddo. What's the prize? There is no physical prize. It's an honor. What's an honor? Well, that's like when-- An honor is when you do something really well, and everybody knows it. Cool! No Girl Scout cookies. They make me break out into campfire songs. [ALL CHUCKLE] Well, congratulations. Thanks. It's really a bigger deal for Fanny. She's changed her dress three times already. Hm. Well, whatever works for you. Heh. See you later. See you. Thanks. What's going on in there? Cella's women's group. Do they wanna drink my blood? Of course. [SIGHS] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [APPLAUSE] [LAUGHS] [MOUTHS] This is for you. PHOTOGRAPHER: Over here. Right this way. Mr. Conlon! PHILLIP: At the paper, they started calling them Fanny-isms, the little jewels that find their way into my column each week. Fanny-isms, of course, originate with Fanny. I don't have a life force moving me. I've got a wife force. [LIGHT LAUGHTER] This is to you, darling. Now, of course, the problem is, how do I keep it fresh? How do I keep from becoming a caricature of myself? Once you got this... The essential wife. Excuse me? You, the essential wife. Well, aren't you? Heh. All wise words, and milk and cookies, and pumping your man up like a good girl should. And when he leaves you for someone slightly more interesting, just what will you do with yourself then, hm? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey! Hey, Fanny, hold up! [FANNY EXHALES] It was awfully stuffy in there. Some very impressive people in there. What, do you mean like that little cutie from Newsweek? Don't be ridiculous. She's just a kid. Well, I wanna go home now. Okay, okay. I'll put you in a cab. Okay. What? You're not coming with me? You don't mind? No. Of course not. This is the best night of our life, monkey. See you. Our life. [SCOFFS] Yeah. I don't feel nervous at all. Oh, honey, that's great. Now, don't move. But shouldn't I feel nervous, just a little? No. No, not necessarily. Now just hold still here. Get a seat in the front, okay? So I can see you and Daddy. Yeah, of course. Of course I will. Phillip? Don't you have that on backwards? Daddy! Now don't tease her. You have no idea how relaxed she is. Oh, I'm glad somebody's relaxed. Phillip? What's going on? Oh, I've got to go to this reception for Kronenberg. I tried to get out of it, but... Isn't this awfully last minute? Yeah. I'm sorry. He nailed me. I couldn't do anything. FANNY: Well, what about your daughter? I'll make it up to her. She'll think of some blackmail. Phillip, it's one thing to cut me out of your life. It's another thing to bump Diana for another date. Don't start this now, please, Fanny. I'm not starting anything, Phillip. You don't understand the politics here. I'll tell you what I understand. I never see you anymore. You come flying in here. You leave dirty shirts, you drink coffee, and you're gone. Now, there was a time when you wouldn't have dreamed of going to one of these things without me. It's business, Fanny. Gossip and schmooze. You'd hate it. I'd change places with you in a minute. [SCOFFS] Oh, yeah. I'll bet. Let me see. Stop. Look, it's bad luck. FANNY: Yeah. It's all so cruel. I mean, toe shoes. It's like foot binding. It's not that bad. Anyway, Phillip's always wanted to see her on pointe. It's a little fantasy of his. A little fantasy? Oh, come on. You know what I mean. No, I don't. So where is he? I don't wanna talk about it.Fine. I don't think he has any idea how much it hurts. You know, kids get over this stuff. Me. Oh. [APPLAUSE] They worked so hard. [GENTLE CLASSICAL COMPOSITION PLAYING ON PIANO] This is precious. Oh, I was so proud of you I thought I was gonna pop. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, Harry. Good evening, everybody. I was in a ballet recital. Were you? On pointe, it's very difficult. I couldn't do it. Has Mr. Conlon come home? Haven't seen him. Uh... DIANA: Why couldn't Daddy come? Oh, it just broke his heart having to spend the evening kissing up to Mr. Kronenberg, darling, believe me. Ah. Good night. I love you. So, what's going on? Phillip's-- He's very, very busy these days. You know, he's under a lot of pressure. He's writing these political pieces and things. I didn't ask about him. I was talking about you. I knew that. Wednesday night is my women's group. I go around 8:30. Oh, no. No, no, no. Not for me. No, I can only take one of you pushy broads at a time. Ha! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Night. Night. FANNY: I'm awake. How did it go? Charming. She was absolutely lovely. Oh, I'm sure. And how was your performance? Oh, who knows? You do these things, you milk the circuit. I'd like to go with you on the next one, whatever it is. You'd be bored silly. And you're not? [SCOFFS] You know, Phillip, I'm feeling left out. You've got your whole life compartmentalized. And I'm over there. Notice how we always have this conversation when I'm totally exhausted? The problem is we never have this conversation. It's the only conversation we have. One endless tape loop. Someone once called me the essential wife. Did you know that? Okay, time out. I gotta get some sleep. Essentially yours... whatever that's worth. No. I'm not doing this tonight. You go solo, huh? You know all the parts. I sure do. Marriages work as long as the oppressed see themselves as being, quote, "cared for." Well, you know, protected from other males, fed, sheltered, all that garbage. Once she understands that she doesn't need his, quote, "care," she breaks the chains. That's pretty facile, Mary. [TRAIN RUMBLING IN DISTANCE] She needs his, quote, "care," to help raise her, quote, "children." She shouldn't be made to feel she's selling herself into slavery. She is. She is. She is. Alimony is a form of slavery. It is like this gold card that saps you spiritually. Uh-uh. Lincoln's promise to the slaves. "Forty acres and a mule," same thing. Don't say that. Same thing exactly. What happens? What if he begins to see you as someone who provides a kind of service? And you tiptoe around him. Try to please him. The more you ask for reassurance that... he still loves you... and still wants you, the more you end up... whining. And the more he ends up distancing himself until... you just disappear. Hey! Hold it! This is not my thing, Cella. Not at all. Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. It's not like, you know, I make $25 every new recruit I bring in. You couldn't pay me to listen to this. Hey, is this Phillip speaking? Listen, my friend. We may have plenty of days that are not suitable for publication, but we have a working marriage, okay? It works. Now, it may splatter, it may clank, it may need a good kick every once in a while, but it works. So leave us alone, okay? [♪♪♪] [POLICE SIREN BLARING IN DISTANCE] Come to bed. No. No. Listen, I want some coffee. No, bed. Please, make a pot of coffee. Just leave it at the door. Honey, look, a few hours won't hurt-- Maybe you didn't hear me. Make some coffee and close the door on your way out. What are you working on? You think I'm gonna discuss this with you now? Well, I just wondered-- Look, if I finish this sucker, I'll let you read it. How's that? That's fine. I'll make coffee. Good girl. Phillip--Black. Look, I'm sorry. I know you're under a lot of pressure. And I'm sorry. And I don't wanna make it worse. I-- Could you please try and complete a sentence, huh? Everybody needs to hear things sometimes. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? I need to hear things. I wouldn't mind if you... Look, if we could just get back maybe to the some of the playful times, it would be so much easier. These things don't go stale-- Just please get the hell out of here now! Please! Now! Go! [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Hi. I was a complete jerk last night. I'm sorry. No excuses. No jive. It's not that easy, Phillip. I have a proposal. I left a file on my desk. It should say McMillan. If you bring it down, I'll buy you a serious lunch. I'll think about it. Think fast. I need it by noon. Okay, sure. Bye. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] My, my. Do you come here often? When it's on someone else's expense account. Paper doesn't go in for these perks. Good to see you, Mr. Conlon. Hi. They seem to know you here. Phillip. PHILLIP: Hi, Vera. I heard the deal just closed. Congratulations. I wish I had brought you in. Well, it's not much of a deal, is it? All it's gonna mean is poor, old mother won't have to carry around crumpled, yellowing newspapers. She'll have a book with a real cover. "My son the writer." What book is this? Excuse me, darling. My usual clumsiness. Vera Silverberg, my wife, Fanny. Hello. You're not what I expected. I missed something. What book? Ah, Phillip, your table's ready. Ah. VERA: It was nice meeting you. What book? This is not the way I was planning to tell you, but sit down. Mrs. Conlon. Thank you. I got a contract for the "Manhattan Diary" columns. "Maybe you build a little series," if it goes. Hey, watch. I'll be discounted into oblivion. Oh, I doubt that, Phillip. I need--This is not the day to show up here. Who is it? You don't know him. We'll order something simple. We'll be out before he is. They do a great buffalo stroganoff here. Fine. Peter, would you send Misha over, please. God knows we could use the money. If Diana's tuition goes up one more time this year, I'm pulling her out of there. It's just obscene asking that kind of money. Two stroganoffs, two Caesars, large scotch for me and-- Monkey? Nothing, thank you. That'll be it. Thanks. Phillip, I need to change-- I know, the buffalo sounds trendy, but it's not. It's good-- No. My life. What? I want to be on my own. On your own what? Everything. You see, everything I have-- Excuse me. Your drink, Mr. Conlon. Thanks. Everything I have is wired into you. I mean, all of the emotional circuitry is about you, your work, and your needs, and your accomplishments, and your calls. And I get lost in the wires, Phillip. I do. Emotional circuitry? Oh, boy. This is Cella, right? She's working you over. Don't tell me you're going to these sessions. No, this is not Cella. This is me. Finally, this is me. These are lonely, frustrated women, Fanny. FANNY: This has nothing to do with Cella. I should have seen this coming. How long have you been going to these meetings? [SCOFFS] It has nothing to do with that! Give me some credit for being able to think for myself! Carter. Hello, Phillip. Fanny! Misha. Honey. Can I see you for a moment in the kitchen, please? Hello, Vera. Right now. What do you think you're doing? You lay this nonsense on me in a public place when I'm surrounded by the people I fear and loathe. How can you do this? At least I got your attention. You've got it, all right! You've got it! Well, it's been a long time since I got that! Oh, Fanny, when are you gonna grow up? You want to be on your own. What does that mean? Screw around, hang out, get a job? What can you do? Act? Be a nuclear physicist? What? You arrogant bastard! I have been feeding your insatiable ego for so many years that you can't imagine me doing anything else, can you? Well, you just watch! [EXCLAIMS] Impressive, aren't we? Quite. We just put her to bed. It's the most peaceful time in a magazine's life. Come on up. WOMAN: Coming up next... Coffee's vile. Oh, that's all right. ...with the New York Philharmonic. So you're going back to work? Yes. Now, why don't I run into Phillip anymore at the Yale Club? Well, Phillip's given up swimming. It interferes with his smoking. [LAUGHS] What did you have in mind? Well, I've never actually worked in magazine publishing. But maybe it's like osmosis. I feel I know a great deal about it. Mm-hm. Do you have a résumé? Yes. Hm. Good school. [SCOFFS] Well, you really are just beginning, so to speak. There's nothing here, is there? Well, that depends on how you look at it. I don't expect to enter at a high level. Okay, ask Phillip to call me. We'll brainstorm. Um... If I don't have something for you here, we're bound to know someone who does. Phillip and I aren't together anymore. So that won't be possible. Oh. [♪♪♪] DIANA: No, no, no, because he's disgusting. Honey? What are you doing? Nothing. We're just talking. I wish you'd call. Sorry. I needed some things and I was in the area. Well, call first next time. I will. I showed Daddy my costume for Our Town. I can see that. He thinks I'm entirely too young to play Mrs. Gibbs. I really should have been Emily. Sharon Broski's in my class and... BOTH: What are you gonna do? PHILLIP: How about a cup of coffee? You think I'm in trouble? Yeah. I'm sorry the place is such a mess. I've been very busy. Any interesting offers? Oh, sure. Yeah. But I don't want to rush into anything, you know. Sure. You need any money? I think Diana could use some. Yeah. I moved out of Pete's. Got my own place. Sublet. It's a little studio on 67th. You should have the address and phone number. Oh, thanks. [PAPER TEARS] I... Are you sure we're doing the right thing by Diana? Well, I wonder if she really-- On the other hand, single parents are the norm. I just know when you launched all this, I... I was spinning. On some level, though, it feels good. My God, we've been together almost all of our adult lives. Another experience, some time to myself I don't have to feel guilty about. It's not the worst thing. No. It's not the worst thing. Well, I'll see you next time... when I come for Diana. Oh, of course. Sure. [♪♪♪] You wanna go over to Cella's and play Monopoly? You wanna go to the circus? We gotta lighten up here, Mom. This is true. So make a play date. You're already overbooked, kiddo. For you, kiddo. FANNY: Claire? Is she in? Thanks. Hi, Claire. This is Fanny. Yeah. You know, I was just thinking about that great weekend we all had together out at your house. And I was wondering if maybe you...? Fanny Conlon. Mrs. Phillip Conlon. Phillip, yes. No. No, no, no, don't apologize. No, of course. Yeah. No, I-- I understand. Of course. Great. Fine. That's what we'll do. Bye. I'm going to bed. [JACKHAMMER RATTLING] Diana! Diana! Has the paper come yet? Yeah, you want it? Don't be cute. I'm not cute. You're cute. What was that? You should really pick up in here, Mom. It's really disgusting. Yeah. I'll get around to it. So are you sick or what? I mean, how much can one person sleep? As much as one person wants to. Are you collecting information for your father? No. No, I'd just like it if you'd be like... Like what? Like get out of here and do some stuff. You don't even go shopping. We had take-out Chinese every night this week. So I don't feel like cooking. Is that a crime? So go to a doctor or something. He's back. What? Your father. "Manhattan Diary." Huh. Prepare to be exploited. "The saddest men are these. "They are neither young nor old, but somewhere in between. "They sit on the rock by the pond "at the Children's Zoo in Central Park on Sundays..." That's our place. "...and watch their daughters play. "They take their sons to see the Knicks "and their daughters to the movies. "And after they have taken the children home to their ex-wives, "they go to the hotels, the furnished rooms, "the borrowed apartments, "the places where they live and brood over their children, and wonder what to do at night." Oh, that-- That's heartbreaking, isn't it? "They never go to singles bars on Third Avenue. "They know that if they did, they would only feel foolish. "They never go to group therapy and encounter groups, sensitivity training." Oh, that wouldn't have killed him. "They are either too old or too skeptical for that. "Instead, they poke at their dead marriages, "they drink, they watch television, they read... they have affairs." [NEWSPAPER CRUMPLES] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [FANNY SCOFFS] CELLA: Put it down already. [SIGHS] This is the third time this week. I mean, can you believe this? It's ridiculous. This is a custom-made tux he's wearing. I'm sitting here eating dog food. Hey, watch it. You're talking about my soy loaf. DIANA: Take it easy, Mom. Blair gave it to him. She's giving him stuff. Oh, that's nice. Spend a lot of time with her? Well, Dad has sleepovers with her. Mm... Why wasn't I told this? I don't know. I didn't wanna make you mad. I don't think she's sogreat. But Dad does. I don't know. Okay. Okay, fine. Time to get serious. CELLA: Like what? Divorce. Custody, child support, the whole shmear. Do you know anybody that can help me? I don't have any money for lawyers. Well, I wouldn't call these women lawyers. I'd be tempted to call them atomic warheads. Yeah. So basically, we feel our client has been the subject of abuse and neglect after demonstrating years of extraordinary intellectual support... Is this a sick joke? ...moral support, by lending specific creative input to your client's weekly newspaper. This is hilarious. In addition, she provided services such as household servant, cook, child care provider, for which she received no remuneration. PHILLIP: Household servant? She's been subjected to mental abuse-- What the hell is that? My client demands complete and utter custody of Diana Leslie Conlon. Absolutely not! Compensatory child support, full tuition, medical expenses and vacation expenses. This is absolutely ridiculous! Be quiet. Just let the dust settle. Tattoo likes you, darling. I can't tell. He doesn't really communicate. [CHUCKLES] She's adorable. Hm. Diana. Diana. I have a little something for you. Would you like to open it? [DRAMATIC THEME PLAYING ON TV] Hi, Mom. Uh, you hungry? I made lasagna. No. We ate. You ate. What did you eat? Little sandwiches and things. Oh. Little sandwiches. My, my, my. So, what you watching? Nothing. Why don't you take your coat off? I think I'm gonna go do my homework. What are you hiding, Diana? I'm not hiding. Then take your coat off! Where did you get that?Blair. And your father let you keep it? Sure, why not? I'll tell you why not. Because Blair's trying to buy your love. Little dresses, little sandwiches. I can make little sandwiches too. But that's not the point, is it? [CRYING] I don't know, Mom. I'm just gonna do my homework. [CAR HORN BLARES IN DISTANCE] [♪♪♪] Sweetheart, I need to talk to you. Hey. What? I need to talk to you. No... Come on. I have to show you. [FANNY GRUNTS] Here. Here. This is your father's life. It's dinners. It's teas. Openings of this, openings of that. He's everywhere. He's everywhere. And aren't we lucky? We get to read all about it, huh? And this? This is what I call the early days of his column. Did he ever read these to you? I don't know. I guess. I'm everywhere in them. Everywhere. This is all about us. All about us. Everything we did together. [SCOFFS] It was an impossibly happy time. Just impossible, I suppose. But...the point is, this is what I did. I made this home for you all. I know you did, Mom. It was wonderful. It was. It was wonderful. It was-- I suppose it was. Don't you suppose? Don't you? What does your father say about me, huh? What does he say to you? What does he tell you about me? What does he ask? He just wants to know like how school is and stuff. [CAR ALARM BLARING IN DISTANCE] Nothing about me? I mean, how I'm doing? What friends I have. What boyfriends? No. He doesn't. [EXHALES SHARPLY] [GRUNTS, YELLS] Tell your father that's what I think of his gorgeous life! You tell him that's what I think of him! [♪♪♪] [GROANS] [SNIFFLES] "Dear Mom..." DIANA: I don't know what to do to make things better for you. It's like everything I do is wrong. I'm going to Daddy's for a while and see how that is. Okay? Maybe without me around, you'll be able to relax some. I still love you so much. I want us to be like we were, okay? [GUNFIRE BATTLE IN WESTERN PLAYING ON TV WITHIN] Phillip, please wait. Look. It's real simple, Fanny. You scared the hell out of my daughter. I know. I know I did. I'm living in one room here, Fanny. One room. You got a three-bedroom apartment, but I'll be damned if I'll let you have her again. Look, I'm really sorry. It-- I got down. You know, I just kind of got down. Goodbye, Fanny. The lawyers will handle this now. No. Wait, wait, please. I haven't seen her in two weeks. Phillip, would you please just ask her if I could see her for a few minutes? She's not here. [GUNFIRE, MEN WHOOPING ON TV WITHIN] Well, would you tell her that I, uh... That I don't want her to come home. I just want her to talk to me for a few minutes, okay? Well, it's gonna have to be up to her. Are you mad? No, darling. Are you? Um, you should be. I did a really terrible thing. [PEOPLE ARGUING IN DISTANCE] Mom, it's okay. I mean, it's okay, really. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] But I'm gonna stay with Dad for a while. All right? I mean, that is-- Sure. Sure. I got a job. Heh. Wow, that's great. That's cool. Well, it's pretty un-cool, actually. It's a pretty stupid kind of job. But, uh, heh, who cares? Anyway, they gave me one of these. And what's that? Time card. You punch in, punch out. It tells them how much to pay you. So, what do you, like, do? Typing pool. [CHUCKLES] Oh. But it's a really big advertising agency. And it's really hip. I mean, it's like wall-to-wall hip to hip. Oh, baby, please, I wanna see you soon. Yeah. Yeah. [♪♪♪] WOMAN: Lauren. Uh, call me later. [CAR HORNS HONKING] [TYPEWRITER CLACKING] Oh, David. Do you need anything? No. I got it covered. Oh, good. Okay, Ramona. Time's up, hon. Okay. Okay. Time's up. I stayed home with my baby for, like, the last year. You lose the polish, you know? If I had someplace to practice, I could get it back. See, I used to be real fast, I'm telling you. I can see that. I'll just-- I'll take it easy. Ramona. I'm setting up an interview for you. Ten o'clock. Head of the department. Huh? Come here. Now, listen to me. You can do this job. You just need a little focus. I'm gonna tell you something, might seem kind of stupid. And if you tell anybody, I swear I will deny it forever. This is my lucky piece. You take it tomorrow. Keep it in your pocket and the interview will go great. I don't joke with these things, Mrs. Conlon. Fanny. Yeah, I believe all that stuff. There's good luck that can follow you, and bad. Take this. Come on. [CHUCKLES] And you will be fine. Ten o'clock. [♪♪♪] Quit the damn paper then. They don't deserve you. Write for yourself. The trouble is I'm addicted to readers. I'm old-fashioned that way. Maybe a little vacation will help. Blair, about this summer. I talked to Diana-- I'm so excited for her. She is going to love Nabawaka. I cannot think of a better gift. [SIGHS] It's a magical place, Phillip. I don't have to tell you what I went through to get her in there. It's a closed list. Yes. Yes, I appreciate that. But... it's just that I've only got her for these six weeks. That's the deal. I don't wanna just send her away. You make it sound like she's going to prison. It's simply the best camp in the country. They have everything-- riding, sailing, marvelous people in the arts. Marvelous. You know there's nothing for her in Newport. Oh, I forgot what we ordered. What did we order? Mm. You ordered. Mm... [POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [CHUCKLES] I don't remember. That's what heat does to me. My memory dissolves. I hate this. I mean, I hate that she's gone all summer. Not all summer. Six weeks. She's gonna love it. I ate it up. You went to a socialist worker camp. There is no comparison. Come on. Camp is camp. Mosquitoes, marshmallows, sex, arts and crafts. Oh, I wanna be there right now. What I don't figure is he fights to get her for two months of the summer, and then he puts her away in this Camp Nabawaka. Naba-who? [IN BRITISH ACCENT] Oh, very, very posh, mind you. You should have seen the brochure. And all these lovely young girls in their tennis whites posing in an English garden. Ooh. La-ti-da-di. Yeah. I guess Blair paid for it. I don't think he could. I haven't seen him publish anywhere lately. I wonder if he stopped writing? It happens to the best. What the hell do I care?Yeah. [DOOR BUZZES] I'll go get the money. Okay. Extra pancakes with the moo shoo. Make sure we got them. [SCOFFS] Like we need them. We do. Not. [LAUGHS] [PHONE RINGING] You get it, Cella! Order. Oh, great. Here. That should be enough, okay? Hey, it's Camp Naba-what's-it. Diana's in the hospital. What? What? Hello? Yes? My daughter, Diana, she's here. Is she all right? Oh, she's fine. Routine appendectomy. No complications. [CHUCKLES] Oh, good. I wanna see her? Well, it's after visiting hours. But since your husband's already in there, okay. My husband. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh...baby. We, uh, talked a little before she fell asleep. She asked if she could keep it. Keep what? Her appendix, in a jar. Asked if I could arrange it. Fanny. Fanny! Six weeks! You couldn't keep her for six weeks. Don't twist this. This was an accident, Fanny. This would've happened wherever she was. I'm not talking about accidents, Phillip. I'm talking about a father who fights like hell to have time with his daughter. And then dumps her in a camp when she becomes an inconvenience. That's what I'm talking about. Why do you do this to me? [SCOFFS] I think you're doing a pretty good job on yourself. [SCOFFS] [♪♪♪] FANNY: What do you think about this haircut? Is it too severe? No, it's not. I like it. Yeah? It's very sporty. Does good things for your chin. What's wrong with my chin? Get out of there. What is it? Oh, something I made. Party hats? Uh-huh. You gotta be kidding me. You're gonna wear one. No way. Beautiful banquet. Only for you. All my specialties. Ah. Okay. Here we are. Thank you. Surely. Okay, quick. I want you to open this before they get here, okay? What is it? My first dream journal. The one the year you were born. You gave me a lot of wonderful dreams, my darling, when you were deep inside. You're amazing, Mom. You know that? I mean, who else would give their daughter a slice of their subconscious? This is something slightly more decorative. Aw... You wouldn't even let me borrow them. Well, you grew into 'em. So when was the last time you two saw each other? The last time we avoided each other, you mean? Oh, four or five years ago. Yeah, we were going after the same cab. Took me days to recover. I have a confession. What? I didn't tell Daddy you were gonna be here. What? You know how he gets. And I thought that he might-- Oh, boy. This is gonna be interesting. Very thoughtful of her. Graduating me, dear. The idea of flying across the country for one of those endlessly boring ceremonies with Henry Kissinger droning on about foreign policy and trout fishing. I mean-- What do you want? Just that. It was very thoughtful of her taking that semester off. Shall we? Did I tell you my father was a trustee at Stanford? Many times. Would have loved to have done a little lunch at Le Cirque. Why would she have picked this place? We ate here a lot when she was little. Hello, Mrs. Conlon. I'm Diana's mother. Very glad to meet you. You too. You didn't tell me. Hi, Phillip. Hello, Fanny. MR. FONG: Welcome, welcome. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Your daughter made a very nice banquet. Only for you, very special. Thank you, Mr. Fong. Well, this is a first. [CHUCKLES] A gift certificate from Bergdorf. Oh, thank you, Blair. That's very sweet. Uh, to Diana, distinguished honors graduate, Stanford, 1994. Distinguished daughter. Congratulations, sweet pea. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] MR. FONG: Along with the foolish and the wise. That about covers it. Plate? Thank you. Thank you. Diana...it was so nice to see you. [SIGHS] When did you stop smoking? Oh, about four years ago. Oh. Remarkable. I wanted-- I wanted to thank you because of all you've done for Diana. The schooling and... And I could never have done it. Well, of course. Yeah. Good night, sweet pea. 'Night. 'Night. [CAB DOOR CLOSES] What a workout. DIANA: Well, I thought you handled it beautifully. Yeah? You see this little polite smile on my face? You're gonna have to live with it or tear it off with pliers. Well, I wasn't expecting that. Hm? She was lovely. Perfectly lovely. After all these years hearing about her, she was very well-behaved. Fanny. I wasn't expecting that. The pizza looks really good there. [CHORTLES] [PHONE RINGS] Get that? Yep. Hello? PHILLIP: Hi, sweet pea. Hi, Dad. Where are you? Just around. How's it going? Well, um, I'm gonna take a little time off. You know I hate decisions. You know that. Yeah, I know. Just don't let it slip. Is, uh, your mother around? Yeah. You want to talk to her? Yeah. If it's all right with you. [MOUTHS] Me? Okay. Hello. Hi. Did you get the photos? Yes. I did. Thank you very much. I thought it might be a good idea for you and me to get together to talk about Diana. Her plans, you know? Us? Yeah, you and me. I don't want to pressure her. No. No, I see your point. So how about tomorrow afternoon? The monument, 3:00? Um, make it 2:00. Okay? 2:00, then. All right. Bye. [MUTTERS INDISTINCTLY] So how's the writing going? I haven't noticed you published for a while. Yeah, funny thing. That's what happens when you stop writing. I never stopped wanting to write. I just, I don't know. I quit the paper to work on the book and it didn't really come together. And then I took a teaching job, and... Well, it's been really painful for me, this dry spell. Why a dry spell? Why not just another kind of living? Not that simple, Fanny. Of course it's not that simple. But do you have to carry all the guilt around? It gives me something to do with my shoulders. There are other uses. [♪♪♪] Hey, Mr. Conlon, long time. Long time, Harry. You coming in? No. Well, what do you think? Maybe next Sunday? Maybe. Hm. [SIGHS] Okay. [GASPS] How long have you been there? Long enough. Oh, yeah? Take that. So, what's the occasion? No occasion. I'm just looking through some stuff. Ah. Going out? I might be going for a walk with your father. Uh-huh. You know what a great one he is for walking. So this is becoming like a regular thing now, huh? I mean, what is this? Like the fourth time? Don't count. That sweater's very-- It's just your color. I didn't get that for you, did I? [LAUGHING] No. Anything you bought me has long since been recycled. Men have the most unreasonable sense of how long things last. Do we? Mm. I'd like to think it's not that unreasonable. I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this without making it seem as if you're somehow involved. But... I'm leaving Blair. Got nothing to do with you, Fanny. It's been a long time coming. I'm looking at apartments on the west side. Are you coming back to the old neighborhood? Yeah. But the big headline is, I had a terrific writing day yesterday. It just came back, Fanny. All the old rhythms. Heh. I can't tell you how good it felt to watch my fingers moving over the keys and I couldn't stop 'em. That sounds good to me. ♪ You great, big Beautiful doll ♪ ♪ Let me put My arms around you ♪ Diana! Mom? FANNY: Diana! Honey. I-- I found a bump. Take it easy, Mom. What's the medical term? I-- A lump. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Thursday, split pea. No, thanks. It's split pea. I love split pea. Comes with half a sandwich. Chicken salad, tuna? Nothing for me. Give her a chicken salad. A whole one, my half. [SIGHS] So? What did he say? You know, you got this map. And you can hold it in your hands and look at it. And you follow the lines. And you get to a place you like and you think, I'll stay. What did he say? That the map really isn't the territory, is it? I have maybe a year. He said it so softly, I had to lean forward so I could hear him. It's all over me. It's all in me. Do you want mayo on that, sweetheart? I don't want a goddamn sandwich! [SPOON CLATTERS] [GROANS, SIGHS] [GRUNTS] Hi. [WEAKLY] Is it done? Yup. Both breasts? Yeah. Oh, God. Oh, God. [SOBBING] Good news is the surgeon could take you. He's doing the most innovative work right now. Fanny, you go with him, there's a good chance... [SNORTS] Chance? For what? You win some time. That's all anybody can do. We win it every day, all of us. We just don't realize it. [SIGHS] Save it. Where's Diana? PHILLIP: You want to see her? Yeah. Okay. [♪♪♪] Is she up? She wants to see you. [SIGHS] Are you okay? I thought I was. Go on in. Go see her. You know, I don't know who's the more scared, me or Mom. I mean, all I want to do is sleep... which is what I do when I can't deal. You should've seen me at school. Some kids food binged, and I slept. It's a much better response to stress, don't you think? Go on, now. Go see her. Okay. Dad, I'm really glad you're with us. I don't think that we-- Well, I know that I couldn't. [♪♪♪] I love you. Me too. Go on. PHILLIP: I'll get the stuff out of the trunk. HARRY: Thanks. Welcome back.Harry. Hey. Good to see you. Honey, will you--? Go slow. [SIGHS] So, you got a band? Sure do, Ms. Conlon. [CHUCKLING] Full brass section. Oh. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Oh, man. FANNY: How about just the couch, huh? Okay. Where do you want these? Oh, just put them there. Come on in. I've got some things I've gotta-- FANNY: Please, come sit down. You're staying for dinner, aren't you, Dad? No. I really have some things that I have to get done tonight. Oh. Another time? Yes. Okay. Keys, hon. See you. He was so frightened, wasn't he? Who? Your father. What do you mean? Well, you know, we've been so careful, to meet outside in the park. Neutral ground. This was his first time inside. I think he was afraid of getting sucked back in. You notice how he stayed near the door the whole time. You gotta give him time, Mom. [CHUCKLES] I wish I could. FANNY: You know, I want to do the whole full walk today, okay? Um, the whole two hours, our usual route, no shortcuts. All right? Sure. Whatever you think you can handle, just don't overdo it. You don't have to prove anything. Says who? Says me. [CHORTLES] You don't want to wear me out, do you? No. No, I don't wanna lose you. Not now. I keep spending so much time thinking about how things went for us. I have these pieces of memory, these... chunks. The rest is just-- The rest is just debris. Blown-out tires and abandoned wrecks. Let's drive right by. Okay? Okay. [WIND HOWLING] [♪♪♪] It's Moscow out there, Mom. It is absolutely Moscow out there. Well, there goes my treatment. What, you're scheduled for today? Yeah. Well, one day, more or less. It doesn't really matter, does it? [SIGHS] We're about to find out. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Dad? You gotta do something. All right. No, no. All right. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] [ENGINE STRUGGLING] Hey. I need your help. Yeah, right. Take a ticket and stand in line. I got 40 people ahead of you. Not like this, you don't. How much you say your name was? How about 50? Okay, Mr. 50, you're on next. [KETTLE WHISTLING] [INTERCOM BUZZING] Diana? Hello? PHILLIP: Look out the dining room window. Phillip? At your service. PHILLIP: Straight back. Got plenty of room. Okay, you can go now. Straight back. Move to the right. Right. Yeah. [♪♪♪] Hey! Cut it off. Oh, thanks, Harry. I think Diana's got me. FANNY: Am I supposed to be impressed? It would help. [SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] Well, I'm impressed. [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [FANNY GRUNTS, LAUGHS] [CHUCKLING] I'm impressed. [WIND HOWLING] All right. Yeah. Well, take your boots off, Mom. You take 'em off.

Your dream journal?Yeah. You write down everything you dream? Oh, well. Interesting. How long have you been doing that? You've been keeping this for 20 years and I didn't know about it? [GRUNTS] Where was I? [GRUNTS] [BOTH MURMUR] So, what's this dream about, this last one?[GROANS] A wedding. A simple one. The most beautiful day. Oh, we didn't know them, but the bride welcomed us. And we danced. PHILLIP: Yeah. DIANA: Hi, guys. Hi. How you doing? Do you need something for the pain? Yeah. Mom, why didn't you call the nurse? I mean, they have it here for you whenever you want it. Look, you shouldn't be hurting, okay? Okay. Why didn't you say something to me? You'll be feeling better in a few minutes, Mrs. Conlon. Okay. Need anything else? No, thanks. Happy birthday, Dad. Thanks. It's your birthday? Yeah. I just didn't have any time to get anything, you understand. Don't be silly. [CHUCKLES] I need a few things. [CHUCKLES] Mom, I don't-- Okay... [NOISEMAKER WAILS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You want some cake? Thanks. Phillip.Yeah? "There is no such thing as too much birthday." Indeed. Indeed. [♪♪♪] You go on home. I'll finish up. No, I'll go with you. I'm sticking around. You go on. [BEEPING] How you doing? You want some water? Uh-huh. Suzy, you missed the party. I heard, I heard. They saved me some cake, though. You're almost empty here. I'll be right back. Visiting hours are over, sir. [CHUCKLES] She doesn't know who you are. How should I introduce you? I don't care. Ex-husband, whatever. Suzy, come here. What, is it done? I want you to meet... my best friend. Diana? Diana? Hm? What are you doing? Well, they called. I'm supposed to pick out something for her to wear. You know, something for them to dress her in. Ah. But I... I can't seem to find anything. You know, nothing seems right. I don't know. Are you okay? Mm-hm. You know, I was thinking about that red blouse. You know, for good luck. That's what the Chinese think anyway. Keep off the evil eye. You know, and I was also thinking-- And this may sound a little idiotic, but I was thinking about putting her in something of mine. You know, so that I could be close to her. Sweetheart... I've been working on something for the service. I'd like you to let me know what you think. All right? "When I try to write about Fanny... "I get stuck in a place "somewhere between regret and deliverance. "We were married for 12 years... "divorced for about as many. "Most of what I remember of our time together is bittersweet. "The birth of Diana... "the honey days... "then the years apart... bitter beyond belief." When I met Fanny again... just a year ago, she let me back into her life. And for that... I'm blessed. I... love Fanny Conlon. I love her spirit... her heart, her... infinite ability to celebrate and taste and weave together the things that matter... into a life that mattered. PHILLIP: You okay? DIANA: Yeah, I'm rumbling around in there. I never knew it was so huge. You can get a roommate. Wouldn't that help with the costs? Yeah. I keep writing the ads, but I always cancel them. I don't know. She's everywhere, you know. I mean, I can feel her in every room. She's all over the apartment. I don't know. I'm just not ready yet, you know? But you can't give up a rent-controlled apartment, right? No. I mean, someday I'll live there and get married and raise three kids. [CHUCKLES] I mean, it's my dowry. Meanwhile, if you need any help with the rent-- I will let you know if I do, Dad. ♪ Lost in my illusions ♪ ♪ I got lost ♪ PHILLIP: Hey, slow down. ♪ All my senses Went astray ♪ ♪ I got tossed ♪ ♪ In the storm Of my confusion ♪ ♪ And I thought that love Would look the other way ♪ ♪ I believed ♪ ♪ Love would always find me ♪ ♪ I deceived ♪ ♪ Everyone along the way ♪ ♪ Took my leave ♪ ♪ And I let the bright lights Blind me ♪ ♪ But it looks like it's Caught up with me today ♪ [VOCALIZING]
