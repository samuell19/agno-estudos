Today New York is a center for finance, culture, art, and fashion. But it wasn't always this way. In the 1970s, many American cities were suffering from urban decay. Nowhere was this problem more obvious than in Times Square, the home of Broadway theater. The city was on the edge of financial collapse. This threat of bankruptcy forced a chain of improbable events that led to a groundbreaking concept in housing. In Hell's Kitchen, there were these extraordinary buildings that ran between 9th and 10th Avenue, down on 43rd to 42nd Street. I learned to play guitar there. I learned to play piano there. I learned to act. Had my first kiss there. Played my first song that I wrote lyrics to and played the music to on that piano in that apartment, in that building. That building raised me. It was a place that supported you and nurtured you. It's a real home for artists and for their families. Just like when Dorothy clicked her heels, I feel like there's no place like home. This wasn't just a place to live. This was a community. I would've had to have left my chosen field of classical music if it were not for Manhattan Plaza. For as much as I could have a sense of community, there wasa sense of community in Manhattan Plaza. You know, I've been living here, what, how many months now? And... Well, nobody knows. I don't talk to anybody. How can anybody know? You know, and as years go by, there's a whole new generation of people who have no idea what went on and what had to be done... and what wasdone. In cities all across America, these events would change the way we value the arts and artists in rebuilding communities. So, our idea was attract artists to Ajo. It's a kind of a movement. If you have a better idea, offer it up. I can tell that it's the arts. It really started with artist housing, and there's a hundred examples of that all across the country. And so much of what went into Manhattan Plaza was really a labor of love. Nobody wanted to live here because Times Square was bad andseedy. Manhattan Plaza revitalized the center of the city. It was ourbuilding. Yeah, it wasa miracle. Hey, dear, make sure that, when Mia comes in, you just let her know that this came in, okay? Okay. And I told you what was for dinner. Mm-hmm. - Any problems call me. - All right Okay, sweetie. Thank you. Okay, sweetie. Bye-bye, honey. Bye. I'm a neighborhood girl. I was born and raised in the Chelsea /Clinton/Hell's Kitchen area. So I lived on 29th and 10th, in what was a dying neighborhood. My first love was musical theater. I am an understudy. I cover four roles. It means I am there for every performance... God forbid, should someone get injured or be unable to do their role. And it's at once the hardest and most amazing job I've ever had. Right before I moved to Manhattan Plaza, I was attending college. And I remember those long nights when we'd have rehearsals or whatever, and I'd be getting out at 1:00 in the morning, 1:30, and I had to walk those really dark, empty streets to 29th and 10th, you know, looking over my shoulder all the time. It was not fun. Back then, this was such a horrible place to come and live. [ Up-tempo minor-key piano [ plays, horse hooves clopping ] For well over a hundred years, it's been one of the most infamous neighborhoods in all of Manhattan... sometimes called Clinton, sometimes called Midtown West, it's better known by the more colorful name Hell's Kitchen. From The New York Times, September 22, 1881... "Just outside of the square, bounded by West 40th and West 38th streets on the north and the south and by 10th and 11th avenues on the east and west, is situated a collection of buildings known to the police as 'Hell's Kitchen.' The entire locality," the newspaper goes on, "is probably the lowest and filthiest in the city... a locality where law and order are openly defied. The whole neighborhood is an eyesore." [ Dramatic music plays, [ indistinct shouting ] We call it "Hell's Kitchen" over there, and sometimes we don't say the "Kitchen." The boundaries of the neighborhood changed over the years, but the idea of what Hell's Kitchen was, what it stood for, persisted for decades. It was a tough area. I mean, tough kids came from there. There were the Irish mobsters, the Westies. And the Westies were most visible and notorious from the 1950s to about the 1980s. The saddest of those cases was the 1959 "Capeman" murders, in which two teenage boys who had nothing to do with gangs at all were killed, and Paul Simon made a musical out of the notorious case. The tough reputation of Hell's Kitchen was further enshrined in fictional accounts of the neighborhood, in films like the "Sweet Smell of Success." And, of course, "West Side Story." It's where Daredevil battled crime and where another Marvel Comic antihero, Jessica Jones, got her start. Because of the neighborhood's bad reputation, the rents are inexpensive. On the other hand, your cheap apartment is just a 10-minute walk from the Broadway theaters, so guess who's going to live there. Starting in the early 1950s, Hell's Kitchen was where performers learned their craft, at places like The Actors Studio, the New Dramatists playwright center, and, later, the Improv comedy club. For generations, struggling actors, comics, dancers, musicians, and behind-the-scenes workers called it home, no matter how humble. I was living on West 43rd Street, between 8th and 9th Avenue when I was first starting out doing stand-up comedy. It was one of those railroad apartments. I had to take my army boot off when I walked in the apartment to go on a roach hunt to kill the roaches. In the early 1970s, conditions in Hell's Kitchen went from bad to worse, as America was plunged into a severe economic recession. Today we have a unique form of economic imbalance... a lot of inflation combined with definite conditions of a recession. The recession was the result of several factors... increased foreign competition in manufacturing, the Arab oil embargo in 1973 that nearly quadrupled the price of oil, and uncertainty resulting from the demise of the gold standard for U.S. currency. This led to an unusual combination of economic stagnation, rising unemployment, but also soaring interest rates and inflation... a condition which came to be known as "stagflation." Unemployment is above normal levels because of our... In New York City, the urban decay, which had been localized in areas like Hell's Kitchen, spread. It was ugly. It was bad. It was shocking even to a cop. The crime rate was soaring, and it wasn't only that... it was the perception of crime because it looked so bad. I mean, it really looked bad. In Manhattan, the transformation was most shocking in the Broadway/Times Square theater district. If you walked down 42nd Street on a Friday night, you couldn't get through one... it looked like New Year's Eve except everybody was a bad guy. 42nd Street then and now, I think, is the most celebrated street in New York, and I think everybody felt that there's something wrong that this legend should be living like a bum. The lives of these theaters was endangered. People were shunning the area. They weren't coming. Something simply had to be done. I said, "How did this happen so quickly? How did all these massage parlors, and how are these porn places, and how come all the prostitutes are out?" For the first half of the 20th century, you have dozens and dozens of these Broadway-related shops in the Times Square and Hell's Kitchenarea. And as those begin to close, as those begin to consolidate, you then have a lot of vulnerable buildings that don't have a tenant, that may be abandoned, and they are ripe for the picking in terms of criminal uses, adult entertainment. And so the diminishing blue-collar world of Broadway left Times Square vulnerable to adult entertainment and crime. And it helps to explain why, of all the neighborhoods, this Times Square and Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan was so inundated. As the recession hits, New York City goes on an austerity campaign, and police, fire, and other public services are cut. Conditions in most of our central cities are shameful. Nowhere is the blight more acute than in the heart of Hell's Kitchen. Between 42nd and 43rd, 9th and 10th Avenue was kind of like the Wild Wild West. 9th Avenue was pretty much controlled by transvestite hookers. It's kind of like, "Where are the cops?!" I had a very vivid New York education working from 11:00 until 7:00 in the morning in Manhattan Plaza. Every night when I walked home from the Improv, I would pretend that I was a heroin addict so people would leave me alone. I'd wobble, I'd stagger like that, you know? The massage parlors were just horrible, and nobody was making any money. And so the owners didn't really want to own the buildings, because who wants to own unprofitable massage parlors? In the early 1970s, when most builders were ignoring the West Side, Richard Ravitch, then an executive of HRH Construction, took another look. And he saw this property, and it was for sale. The property, bounded by 9th and 10th avenues on the east and west, 43rd to 42nd streets on the north and south, was owned by the Durst real-estate family. Where most people saw tenement apartments and a parking lot, Ravitch envisaged something else. In the early '70s, HRH Construction built Waterside Plaza, a middle-income high-rise on Manhattan's East Side. It's a formula Ravitch thinks could work on the West Side, as well. A deal was made to acquire this site with the idea of bringing upwardly mobile people into the area. It's a plan without precedent in Hell's Kitchen... a health club, a swimming pool, a playground, a parking garage, five tennis courts, two towers, 1,689 apartments. I have the privilege of announcing the formation of the Times Square Development Council, which will be... Lindsay was mayor, and they were gonna transform the West Side. Eventually, a deal was made to build middle-income housing from 9th Avenue to 10th Avenue, from 42nd to 43rd, with the idea of bringing upwardly mobile people into Hell's Kitchen. Ravitch and Fischer access New York State funding called the Mitchell-Lama housing program. The program offered tax and mortgage incentives to developers of low- and middle-income housing. With Mitchell-Lama secured, the city agrees to loan the builders nearly all of the $95 million in construction costs. Soon, the development is full speed ahead, and it has a name... Manhattan Plaza. The year is 1974. The plan is for Manhattan Plaza to be fully rented and open by 1976. But there are doubters. The New York Timescalls Manhattan Plaza "the biggest real-estate gamble in the city." Several tenements were torn down, and Hell's Kitchen families were displaced to start construction. When they proposed this housing, many people attended those meetings about, "How tall was it gonna be? 44? 48? No, we don't want that here." We lived on 41st Street, and my father used to carry me on his shoulder to go to the bathroom in the backyard. Bathrooms in the hallway, no private showers, no heat. People did say, "Why are they building a luxury building? Weneed apartments." But as construction continued, double-digit inflation hit, and things got more complicated. As interest rates soar, so do Manhattan Plaza's projected rents. The problem was that the rents were gonna be much higher because interest rates were higher, and we had to go to the next brackets up, and that was not gonna be easy. The soaring projected rental costs, combined with the city's insolvency, came to a head in 1975. We're facing up to the financial crisis confronting this city and state. We need your help! I know you're going to give it. In 1975, Mayor Abraham Beame made a bold move to protect the city's investment. The change in direction jeopardized and ultimately revolutionized Manhattan Plaza. Unwanted and unrentable, Manhattan Plaza stands as a towering failure. Suddenly, there was no market, and the city could've lost $90 million, which was a huge mortgage hit at that time, so they proposed to make it into a low-income project. In a surprise move, the city secured new federal funding. The program provides project-based assistance for low-income tenants, better known as Section 8 housing. I didn't really know what Section 8 was. Well, I remembered from the army, a Section 8 was something that, if you were insane or mentally disabled, that was your discharge. So, I called up a lawyer who was very, very active in housing in the federal government, and I asked him what Section 8 housing was. Well, he says, "It's the lowest form of subsidized housing, and the record is it always turns a neighborhood down." There was a lot of fear. There was a feeling that it would bring down the real-estate values. They were down pretty far. I don't know how much further they could've gone. Broadway theater owners confronted Roger Starr, the city's head of housing and development. I said, "If you want to convert this to Section 8 housing, we're gonna sue you." He said, "You're jeopardizing the city's $95 million mortgage, and the city is broke." I said, "You're gonna destroy this area." The abandoned building was a financial disaster. Every day, it cost the city $16,000 in interest. Something had to happen fast. Some neighborhood residents called for the building to be torn down brick by brick. You're gonna destroy this area! This is discrimination! Faced with mounting opposition from local residents and theater owners, the city and Manhattan Plaza's builders seek out the help of the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit that specializes in affordable housing. They asked us if we would recommend how to rent the buildings out, and I said, "Yeah, come on. We got to have some fun." So we said yes, we would form this committee, and a lot of people came and made suggestions. And I would pass this building when it was being built, and I'd say, "Geez, it would be wonderful if we could get one or two apartments for actors on the lower floors, where nobody wants to be that close to the traffic." In Times Square, Gerald Schoenfeld confers with another Broadway producer, Alexander H. Cohen. I went out for dinner with Alex Cohen, and the subject drifted into Manhattan Plaza. "If it's going to be for the poor," Cohen tells Schoenfeld, "let's make it for ourpoor." He said, "You know, that should be 'the actors' bedroom.'" I said, "Alex, that's the answer. Now, you keep your big mouth shut and leave it to me." Broadway producers became quite the supporters of saving the project and directing it towards housing for artists. We formed a board committee. A lot of people came and made suggestions, and one of them was to dedicate the building to performing artists. It was Dan Rose. "Oh, wouldn't it be great to have movie stars living there, Broadway stars. Make this a class act." I don't know who came up with the idea. It might've been Schoenfeld. It was my idea. We got performing artists into Manhattan Plaza. Nobody really knows for sure whose idea it was, but there are a lot of people who take credit for it. And that's fine, too, because it was a good idea. They had to come up with a group of people that could be poor but yet socially acceptable to the community board. We have all kinds of people of all kinds of backgrounds working in the theater. And we found out the incomes, and, lo and behold, Equity members had no money. Theater is such an on-and-off business, you know? People don't know from one week to the next whether their show's gonna close, and yet the public need to be entertained. Research showed actors are good fits for Section 8 financial requirements. They were actors, and they were poor. They were low-income. Good grief, you can't earn a lot of money all the time. One year, you could be on Broadway, make a lot of money, and the next year, you were unemployed. A plan was proposed. "Manhattan Plaza will remain a Section 8 project, but its subsidies will go to qualified actors, singers, dancers, and behind-the-scene members of the entertainment community. They would never have built a building like Manhattan Plaza from scratch for actors. ♪ We have all that jazz A Midtown business group wages a legal fight, arguing Section 8 housing will doom the area, with or without actors. The idea kept getting hammered. The community was outraged. "How could you have this subsidized housing and not include us?" Housing activists say the city should spread the Section 8 subsidies around, it should benefit more than just one neighborhood, and the people of Hell's Kitchen demand to be included, also. These people have to live! They've got to have a home. And they're not gonna have a home if you're gonna do what you're doing. To me, 9th Avenue has always been my home, so the store owners and the people who lived here got involved and said, "We can't have this." We went to the Board of Estimate hearings. We agreed that some portion of this had to go back to the community, and it included people who had lived here for many, many years... 40, 50 years. So then was all this negotiation... at Holy Cross Church one night, a meeting with everybody screaming and ranting and carrying on. It'll be a disaster. Order! Order! February 4, 1977... the fate of the building was determined. It did hang by a thread. Everything was so tenuous, and the city was in a very tenuous time. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman! Actors rallied support for the revised plan... among them, Oscar winner Estelle Parsons. We're gonna sue! My family needs help more than actors. We need... "Everybody is always getting something out of the society they live in except for the performer. And all that the performers are really asking for with Manhattan Plaza is an opportunity to live on campus. Broadway is our turf. You know, without a performing-arts community, New York City would be like five Clevelands. Gentlemen, if you want to keep a rosy glow on The Big Apple, do a little something for the performing arts. It will come back to you a thousandfold." That's it. A deal was made to allocate the apartments... 10% for Mitchell-Lama middle income, then 70% for performing artists and mixed incomes, 15% for neighborhood elderly, 15% for local residents living in substandard housing. And the federal government provided the funding which saved Manhattan Plaza, which saved the city's $95 million mortgage. And it was the beginning of the renaissance of Times Square. And that's how it became that us guys got the place. June of 1977, Manhattan Plaza opened its doors. But the timing couldn't have been worse. [ Disco music plays, indistinct [ cheering and shouting ] When lightning strikes, New York is paralyzed... no lights, no trains. That summer, New Yorkers were terrorized by the serial killer David Berkowitz, also known as "Son of Sam." The city was in the grips of a record-breaking heat wave, and on July 13th, a lightning strike caused a two-day blackout over the entire region. There is some sporadic looting. Ironically, it was also the summer New York premiered the ad campaign "I Love New York." ♪ ...love New York ♪ I love New York Manhattan Plaza has 1,689 apartments. It has a thousand-car garage, 15 commercial tenants. It take up a city block in New York City. It is a very, very big place with about 3,500 people living here. And we hammered out the regulations for the community and what meant being a performing artist. The requirements were very, very strict. And I was wondering if comedians fit that bill because I never really considered myself that, but I was told, "Yes, they do fit. You could apply." You didn't just get in here because Ithought you were a performing artist. A committee of your peers had to review the files. Not many people realize this, but the first hundred or so apartments that were rented here were rented on the basis of live auditions. So... I moved in November 1977. I was paying $57 a month, and this was in November... I moved in November 1977. That was my rent... $57 a month. Even then, we had trouble convincing people to move here, as great a deal as it was. Many people would not even come and look at the apartments. I said, "Oh, really. Well, where is it?" And they said, "43rd and 9th." And I said famously... you know, we always laugh about it... I said, "I'll never live there." We had to pound Actors Equity. SAG people didn't want to move. People would not traverse 7th Avenue to walk over to 9th Avenue. Nobody wanted to live across the street from those massage parlors. So, it took about a year to rent up all the units, little over a year... all the 1,689. Slowly, you know, they did, and the word spread. And then we got something like 10,000... we had 10,000 applications. Under the Section 8 program, a resident's rent is adjusted on a sliding scale as their income fluctuates, which fits actors' lives perfectly. We had heard about this place called Manhattan Plaza, where actors could actually only pay one fourth their gross income, and our income was as gross as you could possibly... I remember thinking like, "Cupboards like they have in real houses, like, with doors that aren't, you know, bathed in 50 layers of paint, that don't close." Now, I moved in the building in 1979. The 9th Avenue building was just about full, and the 10th Avenue building was beginning to be full. My doorman at the time was Samuel L. Jackson. My first jobjob... the first and only job I ever had outside of theater. My grandmother lived there with my great-grandmother, Minnie Gentry. Minnie Gentry played my mother in so many different plays and just a really wonderful, wonderful actor... grandmother of Terrence Howard. And when she became ill with cancer, she looked me in the eye, and she said, "Take care of my boy." And I said, "Oh, Minnie, come on. You know, I love this boy." And Giancarlo Esposito, he was, you know, a big star. Who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood, on my side of the street?! And I used to come up to his apartment at 15 years old and knock on his door just because he had said hi to me on the plaza. And I would ask him, "Will you read these lines with me?" I'd say, "What are you doing up? You should be sleeping." He said, "Well, I couldn't sleep 'cause I don't know my lines." I said, "Well, that's the firststep. Know your lines, and then we can work." He showed me the value of an artist by his willingness to help a young artist who had never even had a job. I'm definitely a Manhattan Plaza baby, and my mother was a single mother and a struggling actress trying to figure out which way to go, what to do. I lived there from the age of 3 to 22. I believe my brother Dade was the first kid born in Manhattan Plaza. I was the first desk guy at the 10th Avenue building... overnight. Philip Seymour Hoffman was a counselor. He was the dude that took the kids and hung out with the kids and stuff like that. I remember certain people moving in. I guess I saw Terrence when he was a little bitty kid. I used to see Alicia Keys in the Ellington Room, messing around on the piano with little bucked teeth, you know? And she was just trying, just trying... 7, 8 years old. The whole Faison family was a big part of my growing up. They would put on shows and perform Jackson 5 songs in the Ellington Room. But it's kind of cool to be like, "I grew up in the same building." During the course of rehearsals of "Sweeney Todd," the word came out that there was this extraordinary building down on 43rd to 42nd street in New York City. There was, I think, 10% that they were allowed to lease to prospective renters who would pay the full tilt. You got people from New York City Opera, you got people from New York City Ballet, you got people from Metropolitan Opera, you got people from Broadway. Gaffers, electricians. Got filmmakers, dancers, choreographers. Wardrobe people. Designers, casting agents. A lot of writers. Tennessee Williams once patted my ass on the elevator, and I liked it. If that's not quintessential Manhattan Plaza... Within the housing community, there's a lot of difficulty because there are the ones who say, "Only the poorest of the poor," and there are those of us who say, "You need mixed-income housing, integrated economically, ethnically. You need a mix." It's better than low-income housing, where you create a ghetto. You create a mixed community here, and that's the strength of Manhattan Plaza. I built a lot of city housing, and I watched it get destroyed because they didn't have a total system. We don't have a graffiti problem. We don't have a vandalism problem. We would not tolerate it. If your child was guilty of vandalism, you were read the Riot Act, and if you can't be responsible, we're gonna move to evict you. It's a very idealistic approach to housing for people who work in our business, in the theater. I came in as a performer, got blown up on a film, so that totally, completely paralyzed my right side. If I wasn't here, I would've been out on the street a long time ago. Number one, it's the greatest place to have children and raise them, but, number two, if you have a disability, which I do... I have one leg... it's the most accessible place. It's so wonderful to be able to come in my building, go down my hall, open my door, and go in and have no fear. No fear. Mwah! You looking lovely. Happy birthday. Happy birthday! Thank you! Hello, Larry. How are you? Right there, shoulder to shoulder, sharing the elevator, sharing the lobby, living in the same community... actual economic diversity. I mean, it was a wonderful sociological experiment. When Daniel was performing in "Mamma Mia!" he would always say, whenever we paid the rent, "I want to pay the maximum because it means we're working, we're doing well." But then, when he got sick and we didn't know what was going to happen, we didn't have to leave our home, because our rent was adjusted. We could stay. "I used to think..." You know, I found out gradually that it was terminal. Friends from our floor organized amongst themselves to prepare dinners. We had the community close to us. Everyone helped. The goals were to create a vibrant, supportive community, and we didn't have a blueprint to follow. And so the blueprint was created. In the most innovative move of all, Fischer hired an Episcopal priest with no experience in building management to run Manhattan Plaza. Nobody would've hired Rodney Kirk to be the managing director of 1,689 units of housing. "What are you, out of your mind, 'Irv'?" And he said, "You know, I'm gonna go with it." I did not want anyone who had preconceived notions of what this housing should be. Rodney Kirk, the Reverend Rodney Kirk, really had a vision. I mean, I think he saw this as, "I'm gonna have a parish. Here we go." And that's exactly what happened, and we all learned on the job." Richard came along at the same time as Rodney Kirk. Rodney and I were both from small towns in North Carolina. And when you moved into a small town in North Carolina, somebody showed up at the door, you know, a person from the "welcome wagon." So we had a welcome wagon. The unique thing was that I visited every floor of this building and I visited every apartment. Each floor was willing to say, "We would like to be a community." Rodney was determined that it was not gonna be like another building here in New York. In New York City, before Manhattan Plaza, there was Westbeth, affordable live/work space for artists in the Far West Village. In Lower Manhattan, the SoHo neighborhood, too, was pioneered by artists, but quickly became so desirable that artists were priced out. When people complain about gentrification, they always point to SoHo as an example of where it went off the rails because there probably aren't that many artists who live there anymore. As a sense of community started to take hold at Manhattan Plaza, new challenges arose. It's believed more people have died from AIDS at Manhattan Plaza than on any other residential block in the country. But rather than tearing this community apart, what that harsh reality has done, in fact, is bring it closer together. One day, Rodney woke up, he says, "This is happening. People are dying." Probably we had the second diagnosed case of AIDS. It was here at Manhattan Plaza. We would have, for a number of years, anywhere from 90 to 100 people a year who would die. And Rodney Kirk created this organization that, to this day, is still active. What other apartment complex had an AIDSProject? Nobody, nobody. We provided the medical support, the food... everything a person needed to live with this disease. How are ya? Good. I lost about 10 people in the building. Mercy Hinton... I left my job. I was teaching at the university. And I left my job to take care of him when I found out he was sick. Matter of fact, he died in my arms. We went to Juilliard together. I'm the only one left. This community has said, "We're not afraid to care, and we're not afraid to love, and we're not afraid to hold people who have AIDS." Rodney retired in '97... had lung cancer, and he had emphysema. When Rodney died, the Stay Well Center was renamed in Rodney's honor. The charter was expanded to include anyone who was terminally or chronically ill. Neighbors helping neighbors. That's really what it's about. Rodney was given a gift, he would say, and he just wanted to work it and make it special. And he did. Outside of Manhattan Plaza, a neighborhood began raising itself up. Right from the get-go, the word "community" was really important. You know, we had a lot of folks from this community, and there was a sense of wanting to invest in it. In other words, "We got to make this work. We're the experiment." I mean, I don't think anyone was oblivious to that, that this was an experiment and, "We hope it works, and we're gonna make it work." As the Manhattan Plaza community took hold, the nonprofit 42nd Street Development Corporation began purchasing derelict properties across the street. Then we started this company to see if we could rescue the west end of 42nd Street. We were able to acquire all the properties on the south side of 42nd Street, between 9th and 10th Avenue. And Bob Moss, who started and ran Playwrights Horizons, he said, "Well, what are you gonna stick in them?" And I said, "Whatever we think will trigger a renewal over here." And he said, "Make them theaters." And that's how Theatre Row got started. On the other side of 42nd Street from Manhattan Plaza, strip joints, massage parlors, and porn shops were displaced by six small theaters, including one named in memory of Rodney Kirk. Playhouses replaced sex shops, and a new kind of nightlife emerged. Good users push out bad users, and so Manhattan Plaza gave off signals to the investment community and the real-estate community that things were gonna be better. And instead of people renting out to massage parlors, they started renting out to local little stores. When we came here, there was nothing. There was absolutely nothing. What happened as a result of all of these energetic young and old and this wonderful mix of people moving into this building, it was the rebirth of this neighborhood and this community. I moved to Manhattan Plaza in the early '80s. I had just come back from doing a play in Italy. I called my agent, and my agent said, "Arnold who?" And that kind of let me know that I didn't want a theater career anymore. So I decided that even though I understood myself as a creative person, that I could be creative in other areas of my life. And Arnold started baking his grandmother's apple sour cream walnut pie in his apartment, and he burned out three ovens. I knew that, at one point, the building was gonna say something. So I called Arnold, and I said, "Arnold, you can't keep doing this, okay?" We were able to work with him in getting the store, building it for him on 43rd Street, and that was the beginning of Little Pie Company. When neighborhood kids who were just sitting out on the stoop would come in, it was fun to give those kids an opportunity, give them responsibility, and see them turn their lives around. The climate of change in Hell's Kitchen spreads eastward. In Times Square, new tax incentives and zoning changes spur development. There's no more startling turnaround of any urban environment anywhere in America than is happening right here on 42nd street. Times Square never looks back. Businesses, economic activity follow people, and they particularly follow people like artists. So if you bring artists into the center of town... and this is true in a lot of very challenged and difficult neighborhoods all across the country... you bring artists in there, and those places start to transform. Everyone's investing money in all these classic, deteriorated neighborhoods. You know what? If you invest in people, you will be rewarded. Our mandate, self-imposed, was to create a climate conducive to the renaissance of Times Square, which is what we did. 1, 2, 3. Lay out. And Manhattan Plaza comes roaring into the void and supplies at least the homes of the artists and the craftspeople, at least the rehearsal studios of the musicians, but the fact that they gave people a place to live, a place to live affordably, I think is one of the vital reasons why Broadway stayed so strong even through the rough-and-tumble '70s and '80s. I think Manhattan Plaza was just crucial for the survival of Broadway as we know it, for live theater, for skilled craftspeople, skilled musicians. They deserve a lot of credit with that, Manhattan Plaza. If you don't have to spend all of your resources and all of your energy just to make your rent, then all other parts of your life can improve and grow. You were free to do everything. The whole reason I can play piano is because of the woman we found in that building. A woman was leaving and couldn't take the piano, and she said, "If you can move it, you can have it." And it was an upright piano, an old brown upright piano. And so we dragged it across the Manhattan Plaza ourselves. One of the first songs that I wrote, I remember specifically rushing home. My mother and I went to go see "Philadelphia" the movie, and I was really moved by that movie, and it just made me cry. And I remember sitting at the piano... it was late at night... and writing my first song on that piano in that apartment, in that building. People would say "good luck" when I had an audition rather than, "Hey, who's gonna guard my building. Come back!" It was a healthy environment. It was a great learning experience. I'm still kind of using some of that stuff when I work sometimes, just the freeness and the wildness of New York in the '70s. I had started auditioning when I was living in Manhattan Plaza, and I remember I had auditioned for "Clueless" like four or five times at this point, and it was the final callback. All my friends from the building and my mom, we went into the staircase, and I ran lines for like two hours. Excuse me, Ms. Dionne. It was my first big job that I ever got in Hollywood. I remember crying in front of the building to move out to Los Angeles. I remember looking at the building and being like, "Eh, peace." In the late '70s, there were maybe 30 stand-up comics in the country, and 12 of them lived in Manhattan Plaza. Where else could you get to meet somebody like Larry David? One night, after I had moved into the building, they had a talent show, and Kenny Kramer was running this talent show for people in the building. Everybody I called, I called them up... "Hi. I'm Kenny Kramer. I'm a fellow comic. Building's putting on this talent night. How would you feel about doing 10 minutes of your material in front of your neighbors for 100 bucks on a Tuesday night?" Everybody's going, "Yeah, count me in, yeah!" till I get to Larry David. He wanted me to perform at the cabaret, and I was deathly afraid that, if I performed and bombed, they were gonna throw me out of the building. And so I came over, and I said, "I don't know what your problem is. You're very funny. Do the show." He says, "You know, okay, I'll do the show." Day of the show, like 3:00 in the afternoon, he calls me up. He says, "Yo, Kramer, I can't dothis. I changed my mind. I'm not gonna do this." I said, "Look, I don't know what your problem is, but if you don't show up and do this gig, we will not be talking again." And then, a few expletives later, I hung up on him. So, 9:00 at night, his time slot... shows up. Please welcome Larry David! I was very reluctant to do this tonight because I felt that, if anybody from management, uh... ...saw my act, I would be thrown out of the building. "You're a performer? Get the fuck out of here, pal. Come on. Beat it." I had a party for all the cast of the show afterward, and he was the hit of the party, and the next day, he shows up at my door unannounced. "Hey, you want to go get some breakfast?" And we started hanging out, and we became best friends. He was constantly coming in and out of my apartment, and I was going into his apartment all the time, as well... opening each other's refrigerators, eating each other's food. When Larry was approached by Jerry Seinfeld to create a television show, he based the character Kramer on me. Hey! Hey. Jerry and I wrote the pilot in my apartment. I went from like an obscure comedian to an international icon like that. And "Seinfeld" was sold while I was living in Manhattan Plaza. Creativity plus affordable housing plus a dash of psychosis equals "Seinfeld." That's who was at the plaza, these people that were just sharing and dreaming. If that was kind of the energy of the entire building, then I do feel, in some way of osmosis... poof! By the early 2000s, the wait list for apartments at Manhattan Plaza seems to run as long as the towers stand tall. There are presently eight different waiting lists for Manhattan Plaza. On this list, I have 630 people. I have to juggle all these categories, all these people, all these applications. That's my performing arts. I'm a juggler. But, soon, Manhattan Plaza reached a crossroads. Initial reaction was a bit of panic, like, "What's gonna happen to our home? What are these people gonna do?" When you ask the question, "What's the future bring?" how do you protect yourselves and how do you protect your constituency? I got a phone call from The New York Timesthat was doing an article about the building being sold, did I have a comment. And I said, "What?" "It's being sold?" Now that the people had pioneered this area, suddenly the property values are going up surrounding Manhattan Plaza. And a lot of people, I think, were fearful that, now that the artists had done their... task, let's say, like certain bacteria in nature which devour the rotted material of before, that it's now time for others to come in and reap the rewards. In 2003, the real-estate investors that owned Manhattan Plaza informed Irving Fischer they wanted to sell the building and take their profit. We have been under a lot of pressure. The big fear was that we would do what other people were doing, which was get out of the Mitchell-Lama program and the Section 8 subsidy program and convert this to market-rate apartments. Irving Fischer announced the future plan for the building to Manhattan Plaza residents. At the time of sale, I think that everybody was so anxious about, "Was the building in jeopardy?" Yes, because what if Irv Fischer who sold to someone who had no interest in Manhattan Plaza and maintaining the community, and what was going to happen? Related Companies, a leading developer of affordable housing, made a push to buy the building. Is what Related... At that resident meeting, we knew we were gonna stand up there in front of a whole bunch of people who were passionate about their homes. The issues of maintaining the quality of the housing are very, very important. Is there anything that you do plan to change? We are responsible for the revitalization of Times Square. Don't let anyone bullshit you. People don't trust you, and you have to earn it, and Irving had so much vested personally and emotionally. He was the builder of it, he had watched it grow, and he literally wanted to make sure that whoever bought the building would see it as more than real estate, but more as a social asset. The Related company purchased Manhattan Plaza in March of 2004, so, yes, I think it was in jeopardy, and I think that Related turned out to really want this and to really understand what they were buying and have worked hard to maintain it. Well, I think that city's impoverished if they don't have artists living there. I think most cities want them and make arrangements to have them in one way or another. But you don't want artists to be priced out of your neighborhood, out of your community. Around the country, forward-thinking communities are trying experiments in artist-based housing. Far away from Manhattan Plaza, Ajo, Arizona, is one such community. Ajo is a tiny, remote, rural town in the middle of the Sonoran Desert. It feels like you're in the middle of nowhere. The copper mine closed in the mid 1980s as the result of a bitter strike that divided families, and that was economically devastating. In 2000, when I came here, there was very little recovery. At the opposite end of the country, AS220 rose from the ashes of downtown Providence, Rhode Island. Providence in the mid '80s, it was at its lowest point of its entire 300-something-year history. AS220 is a nonprofit organization started in 1985 with literally $800 that I had in an illegal loft space. 250 miles away, the mayor of Rahway, New Jersey, tried a different approach. I was the mayor of Rahway from 1991 till 2011. I got involved in trying to turn the town around. The theater at that point had gone XXX, and "Sex With a Teenage Cheerleader" was the marquee read. The story of live/work artist housing in Ajo began with the Curley School, a building that was built in 1918. It was crumbling. There was a group of artists in town. We got together and decided we'd try to save the building. I had known Artspace from Minneapolis and had seen their live/work projects. We decided to see if the Curley School could be converted to live/work artist housing. The real hope is that we would attract artists who would do the sort of thing that happens in inner cities... create an economic vitality that would result in other spin-off businesses. As we evaluated the assets of the community for redevelopment, right in front of us was the deteriorating Union County Performing Arts Center. That became the base of looking at the arts as a stimulus. You open a theater in a neighborhood, it's not just the administrators and the actors and the ushers that get employed. It's the parking-lot attendants next door and the restaurants and the hotels. It is a very leveraging and powerful economic force. Fast-forward 28 years... we're a $4 million budget with three buildings and 60 staff, about 100,000 square feet of space, about 50 artists that live in the spaces... affordable live/work studios, commercial tenants. So they're truly mixed-use developments... the youth program that serves about 150 youth, four or five spaces that we use as galleries, our media lab, our fabrication laboratory, our print shop, our own restaurant and bar, two performance spaces. I think that kind of covers it. Yeah, it's pretty remarkable. These visionary leaders are sometimes nationally known as "creative placemakers." They make dedicated homes for the arts, culture, and creativity, sometimes despite tremendous obstacles. AS220 is on a mission, and it only is meaningful if it can influence other people. You're educating kids. You're growing families. What better way to do that than to embrace the arts? Around the country, derelict communities have been pioneered by artists, then transformed. Places like SoHo and Lower Manhattan, Venice Beach in Southern California, and the Lowertown neighborhood in St. Paul, Minneapolis, are a few prominent examples. You have abandoned housing or houses that can be bought for, you know, $3,000. Who are occupying these places? Well, generally, it's artists, and when they're there, other people follow, and suddenly you get a neighborhood again. Anytime you want to use public money to create a public benefit, you have to determine why, and that's the value proposition, right? Young artists need support, but I don't think it's written anywhere that performing artists should be supported for the rest of their lives. Why should they be? I'd be surprised if some people aren't resentful at sort of special treatment that artists are getting. Some people see the arts as a luxury and not essential. Artists are very often good investments. First of all, some of them become very rich and successful like Alicia Keys or Larry David. Manhattan Plaza is a great place, and I think there's a part of me that is really glad that I got out. When you only have to pay a percentage of your income as your rent, you have that sense in the back of your head, "I don't want too much success. I don't want to move to the next level." To say to you that nobody here is lazy would be an out-and-out lie. This program allows you to become lazy. You can become lazy because your rent is based on your income, so if you're not working, you're not paying a big rent. However, that's not what this was designed for. I believe that most of the people that live here really and truly appreciate what they have. Does it stifle you from wanting to work? No, it just made me not afraid. It gave me that security to know that I could take that chance. It was one thing when you were at the low end of the spectrum on the sliding scale of the income, and, for years, I was at that low end, and that was fine. I'm paying very little rent. I got the one-bedroom with the terrace. But then I started making some money, and then I was at the higher end. And I remember having this conversation with Rodney. He looked at me and said, "Giancarlo, you're gonna have to make a decision." And I said, "Well, what's that, Rodney?" He said, "Well, now you're at the top of the scale. You want to pay the fair market price or not?" And I thought about it. I said, "It's only fair, right?" And he said, "Now you got it." So, for years after that, I was at the top of the scale, paid the top rent. I deserved to pay that, because I was supported in that way for so long. So, in that way, it taught me how to not only take but to give back, as well. One of the reasons I don't think we see a lot of artist housing is that it's hard to create a value proposition that makes sense to a voting electorate. It's not a broad-enough constituency. The value isn't meaningful. We don't want just, you know, hedge-fund managers and rich people populating our city. We want a certain mix, and that mix has to include artists. Okay, you wait for Mommy and then you do it, and then we see what it sounds like, okay? A lot of the reasons that we don't have political clout is that by making ourselves special, we separate ourselves out. This person over here shouldn't be special... more special than this person. Why should artists be singled out as a class, as opposed to any other class of people? I think the answer is because of what they contribute to the aesthetic fabric of our society, of our culture. And I think that's very... very, very important. What is the title of Manhattan Plaza now? It's Manhattan Plaza: A Miracle on 42nd Street. A Miracle on 42nd Street. A Miracle on 42nd. Listen, this could have been, you know, the biggest housing project, okay? And it could have been just awful. It could have been impersonal, it could have been dirty. The people that moved in, they brought a new freshness and an artistic quality to the building, which I've never seen anywhere else. At Manhattan Plaza, what happened was a fluke. Out of something bad came something very good. It wasn't planned that way. It just happened. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday ♪ Happy birthday to you I always said that it was a mixture of possibilities and darkness, all right there. And so you could choose the darkness, or you could choose the possibilities. It's all your choice. Artists create products... artistic products. If it's a play, if it's a piece of sculpture, if it's a painting, that goes into the economic system of the country. It's not like you have this real economy out here that's manufacturing things, and that's the real economy. And there are other people, over here, doing "art," which is somehow peripheral or somehow... you know, something elite. Not, the arts are integrated into the economy. They're part of the real economy. Affordable housing can actually be a growth generator, as opposed to some sort of, you know, drain on public services. Then... Then Manhattan Plaza has served a broader purpose. At one time, this was the neighborhood you were able to find an apartment that was affordable. It's not that way anymore. You stuck it out through the tough years. You made it wonderful for everyone else. And now, thank you very much, your job is done, "Ciao." How much are those apartments? Across the street? Yes. It's gonna be expensive, isn't it? Yeah, oh, absolutely, it's gonna be a luxury build. That's what I'm talking about. We're being threatened. If they're paying a million and a half dollars for a studio across the street, we're the undesirables. The question as to whether or not Manhattan Plaza will survive and what the future holds for Manhattan Plaza is one that, of course, I've thought about a lot. What happens in the future? Probably gonna be negotiated again. I'd love to say things are permanent, but there are very, very few that are. What could happen? The federal government could say, at some point in the future, because they no longer can afford to, possibly withdraw the subsidy. Some people call Manhattan Plaza the Miracle on 42nd Street, and I couldn't agree with them more, because the odds were totally stacked against this ever happening. It's 30-something-odd year later, and we're still a vibrant community. So, here we are, and my mother was able to raise me in a building that's a great building, a nice building, a good place to live. So I think that is an amazing concept, and I think that that should happen more often in places like this, you know, for people like me to have an opportunity. I've had people come from all over the country to Manhattan Plaza. They're looking for a blueprint. There is no blueprint. It's the people who manage and operate and the people who live here. Manhattan plaza is the type of place to live that has to be duplicated throughout the major cities in this country.
