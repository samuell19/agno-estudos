What you throwing? Aniseed balls. Watch it! You might break the window. You coming down? Be there in a second. How long's your leave for? That's the thing, I'm not really supposed to be here. Can't you get in trouble for that? I'm stationed out in Cuckmere, middle of bloody nowhere, no one'll find out it's nice there though, when the war's over I'll take you. That'd be nice. What d'you think you're doing? Coming for a swim? Oh! It's freezing! You coming in then, Tup? Fat chance! You silly bugger! Oi! - Enjoy your time in there boy! - Hey hey! Another Tiger! - Hang on a minute, Standing innit? - Yeah, that's right. I'm sorry I can't quite remember you're erm... Grimes, Andrew Grimes - What you in for? - Oh, this and that... how about yourself? - Too late for a bloody training exercise. - Oh, Army'll come down on you like a ton of bricks! Storm in a blood tea-cup, innit? I could do with a cup of tea about now. Ha, join the club! - Did you get your transfer thingy through? - Yeah, yeah. The wife weren't too pleased. Can't imagine she would be! I'm telling you, if those rich toffs in Downing Street came to their senses, they'd put me in old Churchill's seat I'd have this entire war sorted out in a jiffy The way I see it, it's all about land. Empire. This is yours and this is ours. I mean take Poland. Why they wanted to start a war over it, I'll never know. You been there? Nope. Nah, neither. Let 'em have the shit-hole, as long as we can hold on to India. I mean starting a war over Africa I can understand. It's cos of the oil, innit. Yeah well we'll, err, we'll be off there soon. Yeah! Tell you one thing I'll miss is that barman's daughter down the Bell and Arms. Cor, some Yank'll have her before I get back! You never know, war'll be over by Christmas. Yeah and I'm fucking Santa Claus! That's what they say every single time. You know, you're too bloody optimistic, that's your problem. Nah, I'm a realist, you're a pessimist, that's the difference. Sling your hook now Standing. I've brought you a cup of tea, Charlie. She's at her wit's end in there, Charlie. There was nothing I could do. I know lad, I've been there myself before. What's it like, over there? Just take care of yourself, keep your head down and you'll be alright. # Love me or leave me or let me be lonley # # I love you only... # D'you wanna die, is that it? No, no, I don't. Then why are you going? Everyman has to do his bit, I'm doing it for you. No! No you're not! We'll get through this, I promise. Me, you and Terry. I'm gonna come back, I know it. You have a family. It'll be over by Christmas, I'll come home then. They said that last time. They always say that. Your son is gonna grow up without a father, like you did. Let someone else go! Well that'll just mean another boy will grow up without a father and another wife will be a widow. That man won't be as lucky as me. I'm gonna come back, I promise you. I need you here! I can't do this by myself. I'll do it. Captain Thompson, reporting sir. Thompson, yes. Yes, sir. I've got a new assignment for you German tanks are expected here, and err, infantry, there. You're to assemble a four man squad, go in quick and quiet, and... Damn it man, this whole bloody thing rests on your shoulders... in other words... don't cock it up! - What he say Captain? - We're going out on recce. -When? - Pull out tomorrow morning, say, 0600 hours. I need two more men. -Oh, err, Grimes? - He'll do. Then how about Clarke? - This morning. Christ! Standing, then. I'll assemble them outside Command, you try and get us some transport. Cor, bloody heat! You should be glad it isn't raining Standing, you big girl's blouse. The Captain's right, you should look on the bright side. That's the problem, everything's so bloody bright out here. Haha! You're just the village idiot, Milton. You'd better watch it Grimes, you cocky bastard. I'm a higher rank than you. I just like to keep positive. And how the hell d'you do that? Ah it's not so hard. Optimism runs in my family, just take me grandda.. Oh, you've gone and done it now Chaz! Christ, we're all gonna have to hear about that bloody granddad story again. I'll have slit me wrists before Jerry even has the chance to take a pop at us! Why the hell have you got that? Bought it off an Arab for a bar of Cadbury's. Besides I've got it all planned out for when we get to Germany See I'll take this knife, snip off Hitler's one and only and then serve it up to old Eva on a silver platter. Oh! Thanks for that image. No problem, Cap! I've established the Hun's general course, only thing is, it goes through a minefield. What if they've re-mined it? Not so bloody positive now, are ya? Unless Jerry sent in the bombers, blasted a way through for his armour. Well if we get through what happens if we run into the Kraut? Well that is rather the point of our mission... We just have to hope that someone up there is rather fond of us. If we do run into them, we'll talk our way out of it. Oh, you speak Kraut now then do you? It's a work in progress. Anyway, we should be done here soon. I've a bad feeling about this. Yeah, feeling's mutual. But if we stick to the tracks, it will be fine, right? Arrgh! Fucking ell! Come on Come on! Get in! get in! Shit! Grenade! Arrgh! Help. Argh Charlie fuck. Help me! Come on! Arrgh fuck Arrgh! Arrgh fuck arrgh! Easy! Jesus arrrgh! Arrgh fuckarrgh easy! Fucking hell Fucking ell! - Shit - It's over mate. Arrgh Don't shoot We surrender Oh shit We've been here since Tobruk. Old Cooper, came here weighing one hundred and sixty pounds, now he's ninety four. Roll-call at dawn, meals twice a day. There's four men to a bed, but they can hold six. Try and make your Red Cross packs last a while, cos the food here ain't the Ritz but, other than that you're living the life of Riley. We've won in Africa! The Tigers'll be back on the front next! Come on! Go on hit him you wanker! Go on! Hit him! Go on! Go on I've got some money on this! Go on.. I'm tellin' you, I ain't even touched a girl since embarkation. Neither. To be honest, I'm trying to stop the desire. How about you, you got a girl back home? Where are they taking us? I heard we're going up north. Some of you will be taken to the farms nearby, to help work the land. Those who will go are as follows: Boyle, Breen, Cameron... Dawson, Wilson, Johnson, Standing. Italy has signed the terms of surrender with the Allies. Right listen up lads, there's a few words I want to have with you before this night's out... Now first of all, there is to be not fraternisation with the Eyeties, is that clear? Yes sir Right. A few other things, I've got sentries on the main gate, mounted. We've sent a party out to recce the local area in case the Hun does turn up, but I don't think that will happen Intelligence is this: our boys are landing in Rome and Milan and the Navy, they should be coming in at Genoa and Rimini... So this is it. By my reckoning, we have just twenty-four hours to hold out, and then it's our time! Good luck boys! # And did those feet in ancient time # # Walk upon England's... # Here. You need to have a drink mate. Take some of mine, it's strong mind... some fella over there's been drinking it out an enamelled mug and the enamels coming off! Don't you get it! We have to leave now! Calm down mate! Now ain't the time for quick action. But it is! The Allies aren't gonna come the Krauts are coming here and they'll ship you off to Germany! I'm tellin' ya, let 'em come! What I tell you, we go out there, couple of Brits like us, don't speak the lingo. They will fucking shoot us! Look, have I ever given you reason not to trust me? No! So listen to me now, if we get out of here and make it back to Allied lines, they'll send us home. Our part in this war'll be over. Allied lines! You're bloody delusional! We're better off waiting here with food and drink, and wait for them to come to us. Better the devil you know. I understand what you're saying mate, but it ain't worth the risk I'm sorry, but I ain't going. Americano? Wait! Wait! Wait! I'm English! I'm English, I'm English. Fumar... Wait! Cigarette? Amici. Inglese. We like... we like Inglese. Hey wait wait Follow, come on. Follow. Follow. Come on, follow. - Buono? - Mmm Ci! It's better, no? My wife, she has, err, paura. But I think she understands. My dearest Charlie. I've been counting the days, but now I'm counting the months since your last letter. Where are you my love? I have nothing left to hold except the hope that someday you'll return to me. Charlie come back to me, come back. Senior Lido, he works you hard? I like hard work, I worked on the trains back over in England. What is it like in England? You live in London? Near London. Err, Raphael... when do the snows come? I'm afraid for you Charlie when the snow comes. The Tedeshi have come, it is not safe here. I'm taking you into the mountains, there is a cave. If the Germans come, go into the forest. Giovanni, he will find you. You must take this. I must go now Charlie, - You will be safe here. - Thank you You need to stop helping me, you know. Charlie, it is never easy. Charlie on the radio, it says if we help you, the Allies, we die. I'd never heard that, is it true? And you knew! And your wife, senior Lido, do they know!? How did you get away? The Germans, they came to the mill and they took senior Lido. - How did they know I was there!? - Someone tell them, a facist. What's the situation down there? Many more have come, they fill the town. There is terrible paura. I'm putting you all in danger, I should never have stayed here. You got a light? I don't smoke. Okay. What happened to your arm? Training exercise went wrong, so what's a nice girl like you doing round here? My son, he's sick. Well I hope he gets better soon. I'm Michael by the way, Michael Romero. Where are you from, Michael? I'm from Vancouver. Is that in America? No, it's Canada. I really should be going. But I don't even know your name. Hey! Americano! - Hey - I'm sorry. Hey I know you! You're the lady from the hospital. You have a good memory. Hey wait a minute! Hey! How's your kid? I'm on my way to get him from school, so if you don't mind... My arm's much better by the way. Well it won't be for much longer if you keep running out of buildings - not looking where you're going. - But you bumped into me! Well without me to catch you, you'd have run straight into the road. Well it woulda been a whole lot worse if I went into a car. I'm not sure worse is the right word. Hey, that's not fair! - Isn't there some other girl you can bother? - I'd rather bother you. Well you're doing a good job. What is it with you people? I'm just trying to be friendly. We're a lot smarter than you lot from across the pond. You're not trying to be my friend. It's true what they say about you; over-paid, over-sexed and over-here. Hey, I'm not overpaid! Well I'm sure there are plenty of other girls who'll want to be your friend. Damn you English girls are a hard crowd. Damn you Canadians, you're a persistent lot. Well I'd like a chance to prove myself to you. Here... Let's call it seven o'clock, Saturday night. So what do I call you? - You can call me Tup. - What does that mean? It's like a nickname, when I was a girl I used to ask for tuppence to get sweets, and it kinda stuck. He just had this charm about him... It was quite remarkable really. Well then? I can't go. Why not? Well... - If you aren't going to go then I will. - No! Why not? I just don't know. I wish I had a Canadian Air Force Captain, all I've got is a bloody telecommunications officer! I'll tell you what, you go with him, I'll take Terry and he can stay the night at mine. - Alright. - Really! Just when I thought my luck was in! Dad won't be too pleased though. Ivy, how could you have done this! Have you forgotten your husband's in Italy. What d'you think he's doing? Running around with Italian floozies! He's over there fighting for you, and your son! What, you think it's been easy for me these past few years. To be left alone at home while others fight for me. It's been hell. I don't know how you could be so selfish. How could you? She has a husband. And what if he don't come back? There's been no news for weeks now and his father never came back in the first war. No, but I did. I know what men go through over there. What I've seen and done, just remember that. My dearest wife. This letter will probably never get to you, but it brings me comfort to write it. I'm alive and well and living in the safety of a convent. What is this world in which we find ourselves. How can men unleash such evil upon one another. War doesn't make heroes out us, it turns us into animals. Sometimes I feel this war has changed me so much, I won't be the same man when I return to you. But that hope, the hope that one day I'll return is the only thing that keeps me going. All my love, your Charlie. Along every road in endless procession, refugees stream toward collecting stations set up by the Allied military government. Many helpless families, made homeless by the German seizure of their country, were forced north during the Nazi retreat. Stripped of most of their possessions, only a few were adequately clothed or fed until the Allied Fifth Army landed. Moving these helpless people from the ruins of their shattered homes, is one of the great rescue achievements of the war. The real tragedy is the plight of the very young, the world into which they were born has been a world of suffering and sorrow. Now the Allied authorities open the way to a new haven... a haven where they may wait in safety for the day of peace... I'm sorry, I can't. as swiftly as possible, Army trucks take them to ports of embarkation... Hey buddy, d'you see a girl in a black and white dress? Just came outta here? Nah, sorry mate, she took off. - American? - English. You're lucky I'm with the resistance. No thank you. The facists killed my family. I'm trying to get back to mine. Il facisti, mille duo cento lire is the price for you. That's a lot of money. - Do you know the song? - What song? I will not give you to the facists... I'm a deserter. Oh really? Ci... the mountain is full of young men. The facists are too scared of your English and Americano... to catch you. I bet they'll be the first to wave their flags when our boys march through in the end. Okay, but first we have to kill the Germans... I'm going south to find a bande. These are good. Yeah well, Italian peaches are the best, like women! You know il culo. It's too dangerous for a fire. Arrgh! Mama, can I go down there? Terry, come here. I wanna play more. No Daddys going to be here soon Can I have my shoes back? No, they need to be clean for Daddy. Come on! Hey Grimes! Grimes! Hey. So err, when did you get back? - Transport got in two weeks ago. - Well it's good to see you. What, erm, what happened after I left? Jerry came a couple days later, like you said they would... put us in trains and sent us to Stalags in Germany. the cold... Italy was fucking Butlins. - How are the lads? - Dickie... he didn't make it. He drowned trying to escape... They brought the body back. Four days and nights on that train, packed like cattle. It wasn't until February when the Allies came, they sent us home. Well it'll be over soon... once we beat the Japs. - I've just been de-mobbed. - So what you gonna do now? Well the worst is over... Things are gonna get better here on out. That's what I think anyway. - I'm heading down to Bristol. - Nice. So, erm, you got family down there? No, I err... I just need to get away for a bit. I can't take being called a hero. What I've seen, done! How can I be proud of that? It's so fucked up... Sometimes... Sometimes I wish I was the one who got stuck in that Jeep. - I really do. - Are you alright mate? Yeah, yeah. Never been better. I'd err, I'd best be off. Well if you're, erm, ever down Sussex way, then feel free to drop by. - Sounds good. - Yeah. It's good to see you. My dearest wife. It won't be long now when I shall be able to see you both every night. All I hope my darling, is that you won't get too used to seeing me and that we start living like other married couples just taking things for granted. When we get our own home, we should be happy. And if you want your little girl by then, then all you have to do is ask me. I suppose you still do want her? Well this is about all I can write tonight, so if I get a letter from you tomorrow I will write again too. All my love darling. Charlie P.S. kiss Terry for me, tell him I got his letter and that I hope he comes to meet me again on Saturday.
