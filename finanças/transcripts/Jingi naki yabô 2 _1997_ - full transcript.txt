Toei V-Cinema Ambulance! Ambulance! Brother! I'm an idiot, but I would do anything for you. You got it wrong. We're just paying a visit to the injured. I had no idea you had such a great old man. He's not my biological father. But it's been 4 years, you must miss him. Ambition Without Honor 2 Yuta Sone Kojiro Shimizu Hiroko Sakuramachi Takashi Shikauchi Shingo Yamashiro Mariko Yamamoto Hirotaro Honda Harumi Sone Go Wakabayashi Honey! Tetsuya is back! Is it Tetsuya? Testuya... Boss! Tetsuya is back! Fortunately, it's not fatal as no vital organs were hit. What are you staring at? At least, grab his hand! Go away! Don't let strangers into the room! Boss! Tetsuya! Apologize. You ran away without notifying us and haven't even called. Throw him out! Honey... Tetsuya! Hey! Tetsuya! He hasn't changed a bit, has he? Who did this? Some random Iranian. An Iranian? You got no clue? What are you talking about? It is obvious that Yamane sent him! Shut up! Where do you think you are? Guide me. Where? I'm going to say hito a guy called Yamane. Please wait! If you go now, they will crush us in no time. Why? They are under the Hakusan Alliance. The Hakusan Alliance? Tetsuya? You're getting married? Yes! Is he yakuza? No, a doctor from this hospital. 1 met him when I sprained my ankle some time ago. A doctor... You are lucky to have such a decent fiances. We initially planned to get married next month... But with my father's injury, don't know how things will turn out. -Ms. Ryoko! - Yes! I will check on your father soon. I will join you right away. That guy? Yes. He's a very earnest person. He can't drink alcohol at all. He is very kind. Tetsuya! Wait! Why are you doing this? Is it because you don't want to take over my father's clan? Is that it? I will talk to him! You don't have to become a yakuza again! It's because It's because you are my sister. Huh? Thank you. I'm sure your father is secretly happy about this. He wants the Leader and you to take care of the clan. That's good. If he takes over, the morale will change in no time. I can't do that. I told him that too. I told him that you'd want to do everything the right way... and that he wouldn't be able to convince you otherwise. I'm just... Last year, I took a vow to become the underling of a boss called Mogami in Osaka. Avow? Mogami in Osaka? You... Leader! Hey! Walk faster! Bastard! What are you doing? Hey! Get in now! What's happening? Leader! It's such a mess here! We are arresting him for the murder of the Iranian the other day. That's ridiculous! We've already closed that as self-defense! He had a brawl with the Iranian last month. Allegedly, he threatened to kill him. Huh? This means that he had the intention to kill him. I don't recall anything like that! Get in! Get in now! Be careful! That's what this is about. Thank you for last time. Tetsuya, stop. Haven't seen you around for a while. You visiting your old man? - Bastard! -Shut up! Are you going to beat me up again? Yamane Building Guide 4F Yamane Production 3F Yamane Production 2F Loan Office 1F Sekimoto Lease - Welcome! - Idiot! 1 fucking told you! No Smoking! Sorry. Hey! Why did you use a random Iranian? I told you to always use the Chinese, you piece of shit! Stop right there. There is always something annoying about how you do your job. -Sorry. -Sasamoto! Yes. Take care of Grandpa lwasaki. I got it.. Tokijiro... He's twitching! Doctor! Doctor! - Yes! -What should I do? - Hurry! - Let's go! Breathe! Tetsuya? You must be Tetsuya. Come here. It's been a while. Idiot! It's more than a while! Come in. Come in. That is... This? This is a keepsake my brother gave to me. A keepsake? He died for the country and became one of the gods. Even if his body here is rotting, I can't let it rust away. Hey, come in! Your father's condition is better than you expected, isn't it? People say that he still has things to finish in this world. That kind of person doesn't die, even if somebody tries to kill them. You still haven't furnished the room at all. What? I don't need anything. Come to think of it, the most useless thing in this world is me. It's delicious! How's your liver? I sterilize it with this every day. You are very kind to others, but very rough on yourself. When |I die, spread the ashes on the river nearby. No chanting or grave required. I will go to heaven if you do it with your own hands. What are you talking about? I heard you become the underling of a guy called Mogami in Osaka. Yes. You are not supposed to interfere with the business here, then. Whatever the reason was, you've already left this town. You do realize what that means to yakuza, don't you? There is only one way to live for a yakuza. If you don't strictly follow your vow, you will be wiped out. Yes. Good boy. Tetsuya! You are here? - Ryoko! - Nice to see you. You brought it again? I told you that you didn't have to bring anything. I've made some fries and cooked cabbage. I think you should heat it up a little. Thank you. Would you drink some tea with us? Thank you, but I have to leave right away. Must be a date with the doctor. I have to discuss my father's situation with him. Also the postponing of the wedding, and so forth. Okay, I see you later. She exactly looks like a Sister. She will become a perfect wife. And... As I've told you many times, you should eat it as your side dish. It's not for your drinking. Please make sure. See you. Such a shame, Tetsuya. You're not blood related but there's still no future for the two of you. Uncle Would you like to have her homemade lunch with me? Thank you for your work today. Doctor! What number are you? I mean in golf... Single... What have l done? Doctor. You should know that. Yukiko Katayama, the nurse you made lose the baby. Her life has only kept getting worse ever since, She works at our brothel now. We cried after hearing her story. So we consoled her But she keeps saying that she can't forgive you. She wants to take revenge against you during your wedding. How much does she want? I don't have much but I want to show some remorse. Doctor. Who told you to do such a thing? Kengo lwasaki, The 2nd Generation Leader of the lwasaki Clan Has Died Cause of Death: Acute Heart Failure I'm glad you were able to meet Tetsuya before you died. You are such a lucky guy. Excuse me. Sister, I've hired an undertaker to do a private funeral. It will be held at the temple next month. Are you okay with me calling you Sister? Can't Tetsuya take over? Tetsuya? The goal of today's search is to prevent any reckless. Attempts to avenge his death in advance! Let's comb the lwasaki Clan's territory! Don't miss any detail! What are you doing here? This is unfair! Why should we go through this? Who the fuck are you? Don't touch me! Get the fuck out! Let me go! Who the fuck are you? Hey! Sorry for interrupting your mourning. We got a warrant. Calm down! Do yakuza die just like everybody else does? Don't touch it} I've found an illegal knife. That's enough! Do you even have emotions like a human being? Yakuza also have emotions. Our hands may be dirty. But our commitment to living a honorable life is stronger than you dogs! If we are dogs, you are game. Before we put more pressure on you, think about where you run to. That's ridiculous, isn't it? -I'm the boss! - Have you stopped drinking? Welcome, Mk Oizumi! I'm introducing a new girl today. I'm Yuka, nice to meet you. Come here! Move! She's cute, isn't she? - Yuka, right? - Yes, nice to meet you. It does feel nice to meet you! Chief! What's wrong with it? You are so mean! Mr. Oizumi! Thank you for your work. What are you talking about? Because of your work, they have become very weak. - Okay, I'm leaving. He is the biggest contributor to this operation! Thank you for your work. Please. Chief! I know today's operation aimed to prevent unfortunate events. I just feel it was too one-sided and unfair Unfair? What are you talking about, idiot? What the citizens want is peace! Don't they? Do it peacefully, okay? Yes. I will proceed with fairness in this matter Isn't this done according to the Hakusan Alliance? See you. What a terrible joke. Don't worry! Two yakuza groups in this small town is too much! Right, Yuka? Two fingers at once might be painful, right? - Hey! Chief! That's not good! - Don't touch me! That pervert comes here almost every day. But Boss! Because of his work, the lwasaki Clan is like a twitching turtle. A turtle? Of course, he should deliver the best possible results. We bribed him well enough! Well... He asked me to bring Yuka tonight. Perverted bastard... -Sasamoto! - Yes! Never again talk shit about turtles! Tokijiro is a good boy. That fucking Chief! What an idiot! Spread your legs! No! What's that supposed to mean? You came here to pay off your father's debt, didn't you? I will definitely pay you back. Of course you will. Right? Am l right? Am I right? Don't wash it until after he's fucked you. I want that perverted bastard to eat my cum! That was so quick... Dumb slut! Why are you here? I have to pay you back. Otherwise, my father won't be able to go to heaven peacefully. Hey! Arrest me! I'm not an easy target. Few blows won't knock me down. Are you awake? Are you feeling okay? Mr Kitahara!I Kitahara! Why? Why do you hate my father so much? I beat you 6 years ago. When you found out I was lwasaki's son, you almost beat me to death! Why? It's because lwasaki my mother Killed? Don't make up stories like that. You must have spent your childhood in blissful ignorance. He ditched my mother who had just given birth to me, and joined lwasaki. He broke his promise to leave the yakuza life too. That's the reason. She used money from guys. She should've aborted the yakuza baby. Don't say things like that. When women give birth, they don't think about guys. This is because they are their own precious babies. They would even die for them during the process! She died! For 18 years, she struggled to raise me... Then she died like a rag. My mother told me to ask lwasaki for help if something happened. She told me that even if she had a hard life, I was still his son. I didn't have the money for university. I thought about it for a long time, then I finally decided to meet him in person. Hey! You! It's up! It's up! Tetsuya! I was angry that the guy who dumped my pregnant mother like a cat or a dog... had that kind of good life. I thought that a yakuza having that kind of good life didn't make sense. That was when I decided that I'd become a cop and destroy lwasaki. Your old man died without knowing anything. I won't let you have a normal funeral! Otherwise, my late mother won't be happy. I see. Your mother liked him. Isn't that the reason she tried so hard to raise you on her own? What do you mean by that? If she hated him, she wouldn't have told you to ask him for help. Women are sometimes stubborn. They know what they have to do. That makes you two brothers-in-law. Brothers? Don't be ridiculous! He's not even a legitimate son! Still, you guys are brothers. I gotta pee. Ken! Mama has to work. - Mister... - Come! Come! What's this? You're wearing no socks? No socks, see? Have you slept well? Huh? Do you have to pee? Emergency! It's an emergency! Emergency! Emergency! Pee! Pee! I gotta pee. According to the driver's licenses, the man's name is Naoki Koike. Name: Naoki Koike Born: Yaoki 2-52, Hamanaka, Fukuzaki Address: Mino 1-7, Hamanaka, Fukuzaki Date: Feb 24,1994 Valid until... Driver's License According to the driver's licenses, the man's name is Naoki Koike. According to the driver's licenses, the man's name is Naoki Koike. The woman's name is Yuki, from Katakana, who worked at a brothel called Batoran. Regarding this investigation... I think they died 2 hours ago, but we don't have any leads at the moment. We found this. Sake and a glass? Such an unfortunate thing on such a lovely day. Please get in. Are you Naoki Koike's fiancée? Yes. I'm sorry for your loss. It's very unfortunate, but you need to identify him. No! That's not him. It's not him, Mom! - I told you it's not him! - Ryoko! -Let me go! - Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko! Ryoko! Her fiancée and his brothel lover... It must be hard for your sister to take. You can't answer me because you are busy gloating over this? No. Actually, something interests me about the incident. The brothel the girl worked at is owned by Yamane. Yamane? The late doctor was lwasaki's physician. Are you saying that Yamane used him to kill my father? A fake suicide to shut him up. That's exactly what yakuza would plan. Of course, we don't have any evidence at all. Police usually quickly close cases if a drunken victim is involved. Drunk? Even if the suicide is strange, he might've taken the girl with him into the ocean. He is a very earnest person who can't drink alcohol at all. He is very kind. He couldn't drink alcohol at all. Don't be ridiculous. The blood check done by the police shows an extreme amount of alcohol. I'm serious. Ryoko never lies to me. Let me investigate Yamane's Clan, Chief. Koike couldn't drink alcohol at all. I got some information. If we catch a few members and put pressure on them... they will definitely tell us something in the end. Are you saying that you want me to start over? What's the big deal? Yamane has touched an ordinary citizen. That's ridiculous! There is no evidence that Yamane is involved. No matter how many witnesses you have, we can't progress further than this! Taki! You look well now. I think it's okay since the Chief is on our side. You and two others took care of the doctor? - Yes. - Finish it. Huh? Finish it. - Finish? - Finish it... Kill them... Do it yourself this time, and as soon as possible. But killing them because of the deaths of the two civilians is... You don't have to do it! I will just include you next time, then! - Gang Member Investigation Month - Welcome back. It was quite long. I've heard that the Boss died. Yes. Shizuoka Police I will bring the tools. Brother! I've caused this. How can I face my clan members like this? Sorry for making you do this. Leader! It's nothing! Our pleasure! But what are you going to do with this? Sorry. Leader... Brother! You can do it after your leg heals! You have to return it to the hospital. Go! Go! I can't let you go alone! Iago first! Thank you. Yamane! Ah? Me? You are a fool! Mogami Okay, okay! Sorry for the wait. You? Tetsuya? The Boss is not here now. He has a meeting at Toyohashi. Leader! I will cut my finger! You can do with me as you please. Can we forget about the fact that I made a vow to the Boss? Tetsuya, you Are you going to kill yourself? Actually, I've heard about the situation there. I told the Boss that you must be in a very difficult situation. But you should deal with it as soon as possible. Listen, you are not supposed to do anything stupid until you meet the Boss. Got that? Sorry. Uncle... What are you going to do after withdrawing your vow in Osaka? Do you think your father will be happy if you die? Wait? Are you really going to... Are you saying I have to just shut up and watch my father being humiliated? When you were still a baby, he accepted you and told me with a bittersweet grin: I can't fight anymore, because I'm the father of this baby. Your father committed to raising you. Your father and mother have put their soul into your life! What am I supposed to do then? I can't watch my father's reputation become tainted! You are the one who's tainted. You caused your father a lot of grief. And you learned something. Don't repeat the mistake you made as a high-school boy. Wasn't it enough? If you are willing to cut your finger, take over your father's clan. That's the best way to pay him back. I can't. Yamane even used the doctor to kill my father And he even stole Ryoko's happiness! I can't let him live! Is it true? Did the doctor kill my father? That can't be true! Ryoko! Ryoko! Well... Don't make your sister cry because of this. Are you planning to tell me this now and go there by yourself? Idiot! All I want to see is that you take over the clan. Are you telling me the truth? Don't you believe me? Keep this for me. Hey! Got it? You take over the clan. - Yuji! - Yes! You stay on this train until you arrive to Osaka. Brother! Thanks for everything. I won't forget about you. I'm an idiot, but I really like you. Cant join you? I can't let that happen. Gamagori - Mitani Hot Spring I've been a yakuza for a long time, but I've never seen anyone withdraw a vow. If you are going to succeed your father, why did you make a vow to me in the first place? Do you think I'm a fool? That's not it! I was ready to have my grave in Osaka! So what's the matter now? Listen, changing vows is not different from what cheap prostitutes do. Tetsuya, son! So how are you going to finish this matter? It's not like you can beat the Hakusan Alliance by yourself. That's why I want to take over the clan. Idiot! At the present time, no yakuza says stupid things like that. Alright. I will officially issue an expulsion for you. I will let you withdraw your vow. Normally you'd be punished, but I'll let you go this time. I hope you survive wherever you go. And I also let you keep him as your underling. Yuji, you have to devote your life to him. It's all my fault. I thought you learned things quickly and become big one day. Who else would be brave enough to directly ask me for the withdrawal of a vow? Take this. It's not fake. Listen, never become a fake yakuza. Tetsuya! I will clean up the road to take over the clan for you. I knew he would come out. Ecstasy in a hexagonal shape. Turtles have such a good life. I want to become a turtle. Turtles don't betray people. Excuse me. Come in. Excuse me, Leader! A calif or you. - Who is it? - He didn't say his name. Who is this? I thought everything was over. A dangerous individual has just left for your office. It's the old man from the lwasaki Clan. I strongly advise you not to shoot him. Nowadays, yakuza can't afford a war like this. What was it? Who was the caller? Huh? - It was nothing. -Huh? It's about a girl. You really like gash. Hey! Who are you? Hey! Get lost! Hey! Shoot! You will explode too! What is this? What is this? You want to die with me? Yamane! You deserve this! Let's finish this together What the fuck is this? It's hot! -How much? -160 yen. - Here. -Thanks. Takijiro? When ! die, spread my ashes on the river nearby. No chanting or grave is required. I will go to heaven if you do it with your own hands. He... You... Sister! Mr Kishimoto is your biological father My father? When you were a baby, Mr. Kishimoto had a lot of things to deal Since your mother died, he gave you to your father to take care of you. In return, your father told him not to reveal who was your biological father Mr. Kishimoto kept that promise until he died. Hearing that kind of story now doesn't make any difference anymore. A father is a father An uncle is an uncle. It stays like that. Uncle! You can only enjoy cherry blossoms if you are alive. Hey! Wake up! One more ramen for me, too. -Thanks. -Huh? Thank you for your call. I don't know what you're talking about. Thanks to you, |I became the Temporary Boss. I want you to meet someone, Would you join me? - Magi! - Welcome. - Welcome. - Welcome. I did it. Oh, you came... Sit please. - Welcome. - Welcome. Actually, the Chief says that we don't need a war anymore. We're approaching the 21st century. The Yakuza needs to have some sort of order by now. - Leave now. - Yes. - Enjoy your time. - Excuse me. You don't have to leave. So, having said that. I want your underlings to be reconciled with each other Reconciled? That matter is already... I've heard that the son would take over the clan. Are you fine with that? As usual, he will listen to what I say. Okay, then. The Chief will manage things between us in the meantime. About that, there is one guy who annoys me in the department. Mr Kitahara? It's simple. What are you doing? Huh? So mean... Drinking for Free at an Expensive Club Drinking for Free at an Expensive Club - What is going on? -Tell us the details! - What is going on? -Tell us the details! Shameless Behavior of a Detective Another Corrupt Cop Shameless Behavior of a Detective Another Corrupt Cop The media is very sensitive about police matters at the moment. The media is very sensitive about police matters at the moment. What should I tell them? What were you thinking? It's because my supervision was not enough. Sorry. Rest at home until the controversy calms down! From now on, don't contact the mass media, no matter what! According to the will of my father, Kengo lwasaki I'm taking a vow to the clan as the 3rd generation Boss. I'm still inexperienced. I want everyone to help me lead this clan. Restaurant Bent ya Does this building become a symbol for the town's peace and prosperity? The Fukuzaki Trust Bank, for collecting money, is on the first floor. Back-end business is dealt with on the second floor. You are turning all of our tricks into proper business activities. We can't run a good business with a yakuza-like name. We will give you some money as a rental and consulting fee. Okay... So where is my seat? Of course, it's in the Executive Room on the top floor. Excuse me. Junior, this way. Sit! Sit! Actually, we've been checking Yuai Corporation's blueprints. Nice to meet you. I'm Sasamoto, the Temporary Boss of the Yamane Clan. I'm lwasaki. So, what is the Yuai Corporation about? It is a kind of a new political party to be created from merging Yamane and lwasaki. Merging? Leader! You told me that this was about reconciliation. I thought so too. What is going on? The names will be removed after the reconciliation. And then the Yuai Clan will be formed. What do you think? Impressive, isn't it? It's for our town's peace and prosperity. Let's forget about this. Leader! - Let's leave. - Wait! I thought we made things clear the other day... What is the difference? There is no other way for yakuza to survive, If you wash your hands and start over, things will change. This is the trick that the Hakusan Alliance pulls. - Tetsuya! -Leader! Are you saying I have to hand over our name to them? Junior! I've worked for the clan just like you have. I would do anything to keep our name! But the clan is on the edge right now! Please think about the importance of the reconciliation! Well... Well... We don't want to force you! You can be the leader of the new clan, can't you? Yes. He can. The sole purpose of the Yuai Corporation is to engage in economic act l got it.. Leader! You should choose the road that you think is right! Sorry for being late. Oh, Mr. Takemono! Come in, please! - Chief! Who is he? -He's nobody. Even a simple fight can put the deal off! There are already enough barriers that we have to overcome! Oh! Leader! You must see him for the first time. This is Mk Takemura, head of finance at the Fukuzaki Trust Bank. This is Mk Hase, Leader of the lwasaki Clan. What do you think? Would you like to discuss further? Leader! Please bring the underlings here. It's okay. It's okay. Boss! Leader... The Leader is taking everyone to the Yuai Clan! Is that okay? We only have a dozen right now. Boss! Everybody must think I'm too young to be a boss. I know I'm not capable enough... But... I can't hand over our name to anyone, not even if I die. You can go to the Yuai Clan, if you want to. I won't stop you. Huh? Welcome! Come in. What is this pleasant surprise about? Nothing specific. - One hot sake for me. - Yes. Nothing specific? You can say that to me, but I don't like when you lie to her Ah, I hate it! I really hate how guys talk to each other... Hey! Do you have something pleasant to talk about? Come to think of it, I've heard a big building will be built around the port. There is no pleasant story behind a building built by the yakuza and a bank! As soon as I smell anything suspicious, I will shut it down. Do you want to do it? Fukuzaki Trust Bank The Yuai Corporation is clearly backed by the Hakusan Alliance! When things go south, I think you will be the one bleeding out. President! Regarding that matter. Since we don't have enough information, it is under our review. Nothing has been confirmed yet, right? No. There is no way I would do business with the yakuza. So this loan should be... Really, Boss? The loan for their building has been stopped? Yes. The president didn't even know about it. Hey! Bring me a beer! - Yes! - Wait! Bring a whole box! Brother! Money. Idiot! Gather it from everyone! - Here! -Sorry. -How is it going over there? - It's a bit strange. I see the Yuai Clan people at the restaurant... but the president of the bank is also here. The president? I got it.. I'm leaving right away. Does my face really look like this? The kindergarten told him to draw his father's face. He drew your face because there was no other choice. Perhaps, it's about time for us to talk about this? Maybe I have to move him somewhere else. Sorry. We are closed today. Don't mind me. I don't like alcohol. There... Yuji! Hey! Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! - Yuji... - Brother... I'm an idiot! But I really like you. Cant join you? Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! Yuji! 1 pray that the building will progress well. Congratulations! Establishment of the Yuai Corporation! The main event for the building starts now. Mr Katsuto Genba, president of the Fukuzaki Trust Bank. What are you doing? I'm leaving home again. What are you going to do now? Nobody is here. There is no clan anymore. That's enough, isn't it? If you die, I won't have anyone! It's not for me to die. I'm leaving in order to live a good life. I don't understand! Ryoko! When we were kindergarteners... you told me that you would become my wife when you grew up. When you turned 18, I thought so too. That's why I left. Had I stayed, I would have lied to myself! I don't want to lie to anyone, including myself! Where are you going? I will arrest you for carrying illegal weapons. I knew you would wait for me, brother. How about your sister? 4 years was a long time. Do as you like. This house will become property of the Yuai Corporation? Yes. Yamane left this behind anyway. It's an old building, but we can revamp it and use it as our vacation home. What is wrong, Director? Hey! Drink! I was surprised that you were okay with making Takemura the CEO. I'm fine with just getting the benefits. I'm very excited about the incoming money. I get that. But I can't forget the president's sad face. What can he do if the yakuza is holding his daughter? She is from a rich family but |I was surprised that she'd drink a lot when she was with us! Excuse me. Yes. - Sorry for being late. - Mr. CEO! Come in, please! CEO? Let's have a drink for our newly appointed CEO! That's right. - Here! -Thanks. Idiots! Idiots! So excited! Should we go now? At once! I will waste no time! Who are you? Hey! Who are these bastards? Do you think will get intimidated by that? - Boss! - What happened? lwasaki is attacking us! What? That stupid kid! Bastard! Leader! I'm sorry. Sorry... Leader! I'm Shut up! That's enough. My girl is waiting for me on the other side. Let her wait We have finally become real brothers. I wanted to visit my father's grave. Let's go together, brother Brother!
