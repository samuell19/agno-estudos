I'd better hurry. i need to inform the PSB and the FBI ! it's....Akai ! wait, that ceiling.... these cables ...! but then...this is really bad ! this is no good, i need to go and see that ! here you are . curacao is in the cabin. the PSB is with her. at the top of the wheel in 10 minutes. 10 minutes..... how is it going there ? everything is fine. and on your side ? the cops don't seem to be willing to move. but it would be bad if they decide to come out. in that case, i'll say that it's your fault. understood. vermin, you're going to make me believe that you've lost your memory yes... never mind then. i'm here to recover what's on your head you're the one who stole the NOC's list. but your organization interests me a lot. with this ,it should be alright. you came . i'm been having a hard time, you're good at running. the one who came to act as a diversion ,so it was you. what's going on ? i was able to free myself thanks to a hair pin. Kir, bourbon i was planning on running when i heard... ....someone opening the door in an apparent way. i understood that you wanted to make a diversion and have the enemy go far away i've taken that chance to run on the darkness, and i figure out that you were behind all this. let me however, ask you some questions. what was your goal by saving us ? to confuse us ? to help us ? or just a way to recover some information ? is this the right place to discuss all this ? yes, it's the only reason for the FBI to be here. because Curacao belongs to the PSB. it's a no. in that case let's solve this with bare hands. come here, Akai shuichi ! it's certainly the code that is behind all this . but it's still weird. am i missing something ? what is this ? a detonator ! they must have placed some other bombs in different places ! oh,no... i need to move right now. the bomb or the detonator... if i make a mistake about one or the other, it's gonna be the end ! yes, i need to find that person ! how is that possible ? wait, what is thi........ ? but why did the kids....! you're making a mistake. this woman mustn't stay in your hands right now. yes, yes, so that you could use the info against the syndicate ? i'm not letting you! and so ? what would you do if Curacao recovered her memory and talked to the organization ? this has nothing to do with you . the info will be in the PSB's hands before she could even make a move ! damn it, where did Akai go ? he's not answering ! right there on the top ?! but how ? i'm not giving up ! tired already ? i'll keep going until the end, Akai ! Akai ! i'm on the bottom ! i need you ! they don't want to spare Curacao ! they are going to bomb the wheel ! please, i need your help there ! we have to take care of it, before they blow it up ! it's really urgent ! hurry ! Conan, is that true ? Amuro, how did you get there ? let's talk about that later. where is the bomb ? it is placed in many hosepipes shelves ! i don't get how they are going to be triggered, but we need to act very quickly ! understood ! contact the FBI and tell them ! that was magnificent ! don't lose hope Ran ! we are going to find him for sure ! but this is not the problem what am i going to do if i catch him red-handed ? seriously RAN, you have no tenacity ! you need to be angry and scold him ! what are you talking about? we haven't searched the most romantic place ! where ? there ! on your left ! the aquarium ! exactly ! so, Amuro ? not yet . with this, everything should be fine. so, it was really a trap. yes, you were right to look around here. Akai what about the bombs ? there are some strong explosives put in some strategic places. they make an orange light when they explode. of course. nothing is surprising if it's them. this is it ! what is it ? no problem, i can take care of that. i understand how it works you know how to defuse bombs ? i learned a lot of things in the police academy. i was under the wing of one of the academy's best ! but, despite this , he ended up dying in one defusing attempt. a deminer dying by explosion...? don't worry i have got everything under control. you will see. use this. from now on....i'm letting you take care of this . where are you going ? this building is probably not the only one filled with bombs. there is a possibility that they are trying to get rid of Curacao. there could be some in the wheel. of course ! yes, i'll try to gain some time by going there. take care of the bombs. easier said then done. here , take this. ah , thanks . as for him, he can talk.... we don't know how many time can we save! yes, we don't know when they are going to blow up. but wait ! there are certainly going to come ! what is it conan ? i'm going to protect the NOC's list ! these two are alike ! this is ! this is why she remembered the NOC's list. this is why they want her to be on the wheel. if my deduction is correct, she will remember the list when she sees the colors ! her memory is an important stake for the syndicate.... and.... if she remembers all the information, the syndicate's doors are going to be opened for her again ! but if she remembers, all the people around her are going to be in danger ! it's almost time. Gin, get ready. there are three minutes and five seconds left . ready ! ready , we can proceed . Chianti ! we are almost near the zone. ok ! i need to hurry, if i slow down, it's over ! after this all i have to do is... it's ok that was close. this guy is still lightning me... i was able to avoid the worst trap.... Matsuda. what does this mean ? she's not doing anything ! she doesn't make any reaction. Furuya, then , would be mistaken ? what's going on ? hold on. a reaction ! her memory is coming back ? but how did this..... calm down, sit ! stay calm ! don't even try to run, Curacao. this is what happen when we don't accomplish well the syndicate mission. i must admit that you're impressing me. to make so many mistakes, with such high potential. but we need to do what should be done. this is why i don't have a choice. this is your destiny. goodbye, Curacao. wait. what is th..... what are you doing here ? don't even think about it, Vermouth Curacao, you've got talent. you could be useful for the syndicate. Rum! i'll keep you here for a while. you're going to work for me, Curacao ! are you alright ? get a hold of yourself ! don't move i'm calling an ambulance. it won't be necessary ! at last , you came back... i've got Curacao in front of me. 2 minutes before the beginning of the plan. don't you think it's time to go ? Vodka, the crane. understood. the crane is out. that engine... it's coming closer but what do they still have in mind ? the phone? who is it ? it's been a while, Vermouth. like i suspected, you recovered your memory. yes, but excluding this.... i've good the feeling that i'm being spied on. no problem, Gin is coming to recover you in a helicopter. Gin ? else, do you remember all your memories ? did you send Rum a mail ? if it appears that it's not you.... of course i'm the one who sent it. a problem ? oh? Kir and bourbon were able to run because of that. their time will come any way. now if you would like, wait for your carriage. ok four...three....two....one...zero what is th....? oh,no , they have already started it ! Vermouth have started the plan. well received. we are starting the plan ! catch Curacao ! yes, sir ! keep your calm, please ! please.... you're making fun of us ! stay calm ! i'm frightened ! we are getting out ! everyone , let's go to the doors ! no, you have to stay here ! but where the hell are they ? i need to find them ! what's going on again ? it's disturbing, all these people.... i can't see very well do we move ? maybe. it's useless, we will not do much in this situation. Sato, Takagi ! as i suspected, the PSB is in a secret mission. i was sure ! but what are we supposed to do ? help the citizens here . but what about the PSB ? there is no "but", we have to sort out our priorities ! is it clear ? yes ! he doesn't seem to be here. sorry to waste your time with this. hey, we need to get out of here, there is a problem outside ! let us pass ! sorry ! oh, this is ..... what does this means ? these bombs are difficult to defuse ! in addition, i have only a little time left... i should not let myself be pressured ! are you going to wait calmly for the Organization here ? oh ,no , surely they are not going to.... this is ...... we're getting closer we will reach her soon, let's go ! a PSB agent ? it's as i thought, they are after Curacao ! oh,no ! sir wake up ! sir ! this sniper is not good enough.... i need another spot. i can't do a thing from here. well, here we go. well received there is a problem. the target isn't in sigh as it was predicted. the secret police would have already gotten her ? scan the surrounding. understood there is only an unconscious type.... ....and a kid with him ! boss, Curacao run away ! what ? Curacao... let that pod down understood ! it's moving ? Gin ,what's going on ? Curacao disappeared. what ? we're changing the plan. we look for Curacao ! i was sure, she betrayed us. she should have thought about it before escaping. she will pay for it. find her immediately ! understood. Chianti , you get closer from the top. understood ! Korn , aim at the target. ok. oh no, what, you want to bring me to them ? "them".... you mean the syndicate ? her memory is really back. wouldn't you be the traitor sherry ? it's going to be dangerous in here . you should run. what do you mean "run" ? stop joking ! Gin is coming ! i think that you get what it means. but why did you..... i don't know i don't know why i'm saving you. but i've been wondering what Curacao's color i was. but my old self, was she better then the one right now ? that's all i wanna know ! well, now , go away, sherry. wait. the kids with whom you were in the pod. we must help them ! i don't understand the integrity of the diffuser. well, i should be able to do it. concentrate, do it for him... hurry, faster...! sir ? sir, hold on ! hold on ! still nothing ? you still haven't found it yet ? no, she's unfindable, there is only a kid and two others ! it's no good , boss ! they are defusing the bombs ! what ? this one ! i'm sure he wasn't there before ! the PSB is already on the move. only two cables left. with this ,it will end ! gosh. that was a close call. i'm taking control of everything, Korn you, fire immediately blow up everything on your side , Korn ! i know. just what's going on ? damn it, something must be done ! this is bad ! i will not be able to aim. Ran, the kids aren't answering. There is nothing we can do, we don't know where they are ! i hope the kids are okey. hurry, jump go . damn it, if thing keeps going like this, i won't be able to save the kids ! leave them to me. don"t tell me that you're going to.... i'm leaving the kids to you don't do it , they are going to kill you boss, that figure.... it's Curacao ! i need to concentrate until the right time. it stopped ! someone must have made a diversion ! die, Curacao ! she.... Curacao was wounded. mission accomplished. no, maybe she's still alive. blow up the bombs. we must blow up the wheel's axle. the axle ? yes, if Curacao is still alive, she won't be if she's crushed by the wheel. the PSB would be disappointed to see that she disappeared. Korn, fire again ! hurry up and crush her into pieces ! yes, understood. Haibara ! you're not hurt ? G: what's happening ? A: Ai ! what is going on ? i'll explain later. but , we have to stay calm. Akai ! Amuro ! are you there ? yes . Akai ! you're not hurt ,kid ? no hold on , it's not finished yet. where is Amuro ? no idea. but seeing how they changed their strategy, he must have diffused the bombs. what are they going to do now ? maybe you want my rifle ? Amuro ! we must counter-attack, FBI ! i can't help it my rifle's sigh is damaged. my other sigh isn't good enough to aim well, and it's too dark to aim as well can you aim with enough light ? yes! but how do we make them go down ? by using the rotor's fragility. you can see them from here ? with this jet black sky , no . but by aiming at the rotor, with enough light, yes. i can illuminate the sky, but i need a source of light to aim well. it's them again ? they intend to destroy everything ? they must have another objective. this is bad, half of the bombs can blow up ! die , all of you ! damn it , i don't know what i'm supposed to do, use this to aim ! what ? catch this ! i can see it ! goooooo ! that light.... what was that ? fire works ? we've been hit ! what's this ? where the hell is it coming from ? now ! it's alright ! yes ! damn it, i'm losing control !
