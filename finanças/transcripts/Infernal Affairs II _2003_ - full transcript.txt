NEVER-ENDING HELL: ETERNAL, INFINITE, ENDLESS SUFFERING ENDLESS TIME TIME I still remember my first arrest. It was December 12th, 1980. My partner and I were patrolling on Hano Road. We heard there was something going on at the New World Centre. We rushed over. We saw a big gang fight taking place. A dozen of them were already on the ground. There was lots of blood. I saw a severed hand holding a knife. My partner told me to draw my gun. I was a rookie then so I did what I was told. But before I could open my holster, my partner fell down in front of me. I saw this kid stabbing a pipe into my partner's stomach. Blood was gushing out of the pipe. I didn't know what I was thinking. I just fired all six bullets into that kid. I don't remember how many years he got in the end. But I saw him again two years ago, all dressed up, boozing in a club. He was drinking with Kwun's gang. The bad guys get everything, the good guys end up with nothing. I can barely remember my partner's face now. I really regret not firing all six bullets into that kid's head. The world shouldn't be like this. That's not how life should be, Sam. How long have you been in Tsim Sha Tsui? Almost two years. Do you know why I haven't arrested you yet? Cos I'm good looking! Maybe so. It's because I think you're a decent person. I'd be happier if you were in charge of Tsim Sha Tsui. Forget it. You had six bullets but you didn't kill that kid. That makes you a decent guy. I'd rather not be a good guy. I owe Kwun my life. If I betray him for you, even you would think I was despicable, right? - I knew you'd say that. - It's true! But working for the Ngai family isn't just about loyalty. The Master always says to me, "You reap what you sow." I'm worried I won't be able to have dinner with you. Time to work! This early? My boys have to eat! Take the box with you. - Don't worry. You keep it. - It's not necessary. Hey... Do you want to use the back door? Who says you can't be friends with cops? The front door's fine. I'm used to it. Prat Avenue. Prat Avenue, please. Uncle Kwun, please. Someone's looking for you. Bye, Mary. They say this American antique player plays sweet high notes, has a crisp middle and a strong bass sound. What rubbish! HK$18,000! Who can afford that in Hong Kong? Sit. Only around 10,000 people can afford it. Sam asked you to be a mole in the police force. I can talk to him if you don't want to do it. You're one of my boys after all. It's OK. Really? Yes. Pass me that bag. Mary... I've noticed you've been down so I thought you were dreading it. Go back to Tuen Mun until things quieten down. Get fit for start of the Academy. Spend the money I give you wisely. Do you like the song? Yes. I'll give it to you. It won't sound as good on another player. I'll help you pick out a player once you've made it. What is it? You don't like it? No. Did Sam give you that watch? None of your business. Only you and I... ...know about this job tonight. I don't want Sam to know. Why? Women are simple. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. Go home. There's lots to do tonight. In this business, either you get me or I get you. Master said that I would see blood today. So what? The Mainlander kept asking me, "Have you got a Mercedes today?" I said, "Yes." And now, here I am. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here with you. If it wasn't for this, I'd be out with some girls at a club. That's for sure. Hey, have you got a cigarette? I don't smoke. Let's forget it. My car's OK. See? She says it's OK. Look at you. You look respectable, you wouldn't want any trouble. Look at me. You've beaten me up. Who do you think the judge would believe in court? Hey, don't you go to Tsim Sha Tsui East? Don't you know who I am? I'm Keung. Sam's boy. Del Piero's boy. I'll beat you up next time I see you. Hey... Can you call for an ambulance, sir? Look at the blood. Have them bring 500cc of blood type O. It's rare. What O? Wait until we get back to the station. Sort him out. Why do I have to go? I didn't steal anything important. - Why do I have to go? - Shut up! Don't you know you're just a cadet? You're expected to get a medal this year. Don't let Yip know about this. Happy birthday! What's there to be happy about? 10 years at the Academy. I'm stuck in a rut. You managed to get me out. Your case has long been forgotten. You should try and get yourself out. The Commissioner may be Chinese now, but the foreigners aren't leaving for six more years. I'll be 48 then. I might as well stay... ...and train some good cops. The world is yours after '97. Hey, 27149, cheers! Hey, Yan. It's been beeping all day. Why don't you return the call? A girlfriend? - Cheers, sir! - Cheers! Get lost! It's none of my business! Get lost! Go! Hey, Law! What are you doing? My father just passed away. It was his wish... ...that his children were contacted if something bad happened. Sorry to have bothered you. Hey, stop watching TV! Have something to eat. I'm wondering what the TV channels are reporting about Kwun's death. Did you do it? I've got a big mouth. You would have heard about it if it was me. Ask Wah and Gandhi. Shit. I was in Macau on business when Kwun died. I bet his children did it. I'm not scared of anyone. His eldest's a doctor. His youngest's a layabout. His daughter's married. That just leaves his second son. If they go too far, I'll deal with them! We failed to protect Uncle Kwun. Leave it, Uncle John. Dad used to say, "In this job, you'll always pay the price." He'd been lucky for a long time. I wonder what Wah, Ching, Gwei and Gandhi are thinking now. Thank you. Thank you very much. How's Mum? Is she OK? She's OK. She's sleeping. She asked us to take some cigarettes to the morgue for Dad. I'll go and buy some. Team B, watch Tak Shing Street. Team C, watch the exit of the financial building on Austin Road. There are two exits. One is on Tak Shing Road, the other is... Hello? Why didn't you tell me Kwun's been killed? I called everyone as soon as it happened! Kwun's boys won't be sitting still. Something's going to happen tonight. It's the 14th today. It's the 14th. Time to pay the Ngai family. Well, I'm the youngest here. I'm going to say this. I'm not going to pay the Ngais any more. What do you think? Cheers! Inspector Wong. What are your men doing outside? - I'm busy. - You're up to something. I'll talk to you next time. What's the occasion? Make some space. You're welcome if you're just here to eat. All other matters will have to wait. Let's eat! Let's eat! Something major is going to happen. Leave the four bosses to it. We'll deal with the aftermath. Don't let them fight. They won't stop until they kill each other. What then? Pick a card like last time. The winner will be in charge. OK. The higher one wins. I said I've got nothing to say to him. How are you, Hau? Wah. I know you're planning a casino in Macau. I've dealt with the government. Do you want to be partners? Uncle Kwun's dead. I'm not in the mood. I see. Your Macau trip wasn't just for business. I know you had fun with Gandhi's wife. Sorry, I can't let go of my casino in Macau. I've got to go. What are Sam's men doing? I know Wah paid up. Don't change the subject. Tell me something I don't know. Call me later. Hey... Hau took care of Wah in less than 10 minutes. The four bosses are going to have a tough time with him. Hau took out HK$1 million's worth of coke. What is it? The triads have blocked the road. Stop! Mr Ngai, I don't know why Wah paid up but I'm not going to. I wasn't planning to negotiate. Put Gwei on. Hey, Gwei. I don't know why he's calling you on my patch. What is it, Hau? I'm with Gandhi all the way. If he doesn't pay, I won't either. I heard that you and Gandhi are close. The heroin you two were smuggling got stolen. You lost several million each. Luckily, I found the goods in your warehouse. Shall I hand it back to Gandhi? What's he saying? Wah and Gwei have paid up, out of Tsim Sha Tsui's five bosses. Including Sam, that's three to two. I'm the youngest here. I've got to pay. I'm off. Don't worry about it. Cheers! Hey... Pay my share for me. Mr Ngai has gone out for a late snack, Inspector Wong. A bit late for dinner, Mr Ngai. My dad always used to come here after work. I'm keeping up the ritual tonight. Do you want to join us? It's your seat from now on. That must be tough. It's not. You worked all night for nothing. That's tougher. You did well tonight, Hau. I hope you keep it up. We don't want bad things to happen. Let's go. What did you say? We want to have some champagne and celebrate the fact that Kwun's dead. Shall I pop a bottle open for you? What? You want to mess with cops? Hey, officers! The Ngais are already in mourning. What more do you want? Let's go. Let's go. Sam. Thank you. Dad used to run a gambling business. Starting from a small business to what it's become today... Who hasn't heard of his name? He said that, "In this job... ...you'll always pay the price." And today... I'll always remember this day. - Hello? - Hi, honey. It's OK. Do you want something to eat? That's good. I'll wait for you at home. 27149. An officer has to have a clean background. You took your mother's name and you've cut all ties with the Ngais, but you and Hau have the same father. That means you lied about your background. I have to expel you. But before you leave, go and see the man with the odd socks. Do you still want to be a cop? Can I still be one? If you give me a good reason. I want to be a good man. If you want to be a cop, your only choice is to work for me. You picked me because I'm Hau's brother? When the time comes, will you arrest him? How do I start? Hit him! Hit him! Kneel down! - What's going on, Officer? - Shut up! Are you OK? Can you hold on? Hey... What's wrong? Does it still hurt? My dad passed away today. He really loved me. I asked the officer if I could go to his funeral. The officer said, "Do you know what it means to be in prison?" "It means, you're not allowed to go to your father's funeral." "Do you understand?" Get lost! Come on. TIME Are you crazy? You sent Yan to be a mole? You know he's Hau's half-brother! So what? Give me his file! Your promotion's made you bossy. You know that those files are classified. I treat you like a brother and you treat me like this? If I were really your brother, you wouldn't ask. It's OK. Calm down. Just talk. She's had an abortion! It's no big deal. It's just a baby. You can always have another one. I've been with you for four years. I've bailed you out countless times. One minute you're eating with my parents, the next, you're killing. I don't want our baby to be like that. Do you understand? Why are you so uptight with me? I'm not. Uncle John says you're doing well. Do you want to come and help the family? I know you want to keep your distance from us Ngais... ...but we're brothers, it's a fact. Am I right? It's my daughter's birthday this Sunday. I'd like you to come. You really hate talking to me? No. You're promoted already? You'll be a superintendent soon. You might as well be a cop full time. Sam's just kidding. Smile. Thanks for your tip offs these last two years. You used to be a rookie so I help you catch some of the small-time triads. Now it's time for you to arrest the big bosses. You want to arrest me? Or you can arrest the pretty girls. What are you doing? You're so beautiful. Your boyfriend must be really handsome to match you. That's you. - I'm off. - Already? I've got to meet Mr Ngai. Sam's treats you well. But he doesn't look after himself. It's been four years. He should be in charge by now... ...but he gave everything to the Ngais. No one dares to make a move on them. Hau must have figured out what happened. I haven't been sleeping well these past four years. I'm Inspector Wong. Don't worry, Mary. I won't let anything happen to you. Don't say that if you don't mean it. I mean it. Hey! Throw the ball! An estate agent came here two days ago. Guess how much he offered? HK$160 million! What's wrong with Hong Kong? When my dad bought this place, it was worth HK$9,280,000. What a world! Are you moving, Mr Ngai? It's almost '97. Time to emigrate. That's not a problem. Everything's so convenient. - We're just a phone call away! - I know. I'm just worried about the phone bill. The phone companies are greedy. I've discussed it with my mother. All our businesses are on track. You've all helped our businesses for so long now. I don't want people to think we're ungrateful so I want to split the business amongst all of you when I leave. Treat it as a gift or a retirement fund. Eat! Have whatever you want! We should spend more time together just like today. Mr Ngai... are you really leaving? If you go, all hell will break loose. You're a Buddhist, aren't you? "Easy to start, hard to let go." I'm letting go. You should be happy for me. I've thought about it. Cocaine is the future. The four of them ship it in small bags from South America. I've made a deal in Thailand. You'll be the distributor. You'll be the boss then. Go to Thailand and tie up the loose ends. Are you planning to get rid of them? Move closer on the right. Yan. - Come over. - OK. Come here. OK. I'll take another one. One, two, three. One more. I haven't been in Hong Kong much these last two years. It's rare to have the whole family gathered together. All our siblings are in legitimate businesses. You should come home and help. Everything Dad did was for the family. I'm the same. I hope you will be too. There's a deal next week. I want you to come with me. I'll call you. I think he's taking the deal seriously. The date is next Wednesday, the 14th. The 14th - the date Kwun died. He wants to kill the other bosses. Do you know why he sent Sam away? I don't know, but Sam can help him. He wants to kill Sam too! Hey... I've been following you for days! I'm still your superior. I want to know what your plan is. The Ngais are your family. Do you know what you're doing? Sir... I'm a cop! OK. Give me a salute. I've booked a table for dinner. Do you want to come? Hey... Do I look good with this cap? Keung! What do you think? What will you do in Thailand dressed like that? Have some shark fin soup, get a massage, get a couple of girls for a threesome. - Honey! - What is it? You're going to Thailand? It's for business! Don't worry. I'll behave myself. Hau wants to kill Wah and the others. I know. Do you know he wants to kill you too? Don't listen to other people. Why would he? Just wait for me at the airport! Time to board, Sam. That's all I can do for now. Call Sam when the plane lands. I'm going to kill Hau tonight. Don't do anything rash. I won't. I just remember that four years ago, you asked me to kill Kwun. So what? Are you blackmailing me? I'm not. It's just that we've passed the point of no return. I'll send everybody away. Tonight's operation is top secret. We'll have three teams. Team A will be here. Team B will be here. Wait for my order before any action. Team C will follow the target until... Nobody told me about the date change! You know that Hau changes his mind all the time. Do you think Yan's the only mole? I've had an undercover for seven years. Where's the deck of cards? We'll both be in charge tonight. Let's go! Don't move! Hau. You're not talking without your lawyer? Cooperate with us. In fact, I should be thanking you for your cooperation. Are you speaking in code, Mr Ngai? We don't understand. Dad used to say... "In this job, no matter what you do, you'll always pay the price." He died four years ago. It's the right time. The stove's hot enough now. She's here, boss. You're here now. What else can you do? Wait and see. I've got it. The two foreigners are private detectives. Hello? Honey? - Where are you? - Thailand. Come back now! Why should I come back? Don't ask! Just come back! Hau wants you dead! Nonsense, I'm working for him now. Listen to me. I killed Kwun. Have you got a VCR? Is it worth seeing? Really worth seeing. Take care. Go if you have to. What did Hau say? - Sam. - Sunny! Four years ago, you asked me to kill Kwun. So what? Are you blackmailing me? No. It's just that we've passed the point of no return. I'll send everybody away. Alan and Johnson... I hired them to investigate my dad's murder. Some of your officers conspired to murder my father, a law-abiding citizen. Superintendent Luk... ...wasn't that an officer in the video? It's up to you whether you arrest him or not. That was a good show. You're very photogenic. Four years ago... ...how much did Sam's woman pay you? Give me another chance, Mr Ngai. I gave them a chance four years ago, but they didn't take it. If I gave you a chance today... ...would you take it? You've been with us for seven years. You're a cop. I'm a triad. We have to accept our destiny. Don't blame me. Your Inspector Wong killed my father. Any word from Sam? He called me. He said he was OK. He told you to hide here for a few days and wait for him. Where are your family? They've all emigrated. Why didn't you go? Let's go, Sam! The Thais have gone. Let's go! You know you're not going to make it. I know. My woman's in danger in Hong Kong. Please help me. Why should I? Because I helped you kill your boss. I know you want to take his place. Besides... ...l've always thought of you as my friend. Don't believe him, Sam! - Get lost! - Don't believe him! Get lost! Sorry, Sam. Are you arresting me? I will if you're going to kill Hau. Then there's nothing to talk about. I spoke to my superiors. They're definitely with you this time. Really? I conspired in a murder. Even the British guys agree that we can't let the triads beat us. The whole department's behind you now. Is that good enough? Get your cards. Highest card wins again. I win. Come back to the station with me. Car keys. I messed up. There's no need to drag everyone down too. We found this deck on our first mission together. You've kept it. I've known all along. Hey... I've listened to you over the years, it's your turn to listen to me. We're brothers. Would I abandon you? Law's my mole in the Ngais. He hasn't contacted me for days. Neither has Yan. Car keys. Help! Help! Get some help! Why did you lie to me? I didn't. Sam's in trouble. I told you I'm a simple woman. I have to do something if my husband's in trouble. I'm going to Thailand. Do you have to? Forget it. You don't have to follow us any more. I mean, do you really have to go? You've been with Sam all these years... Have you considered... - That maybe Sam's already dead? - What? I can take care of you. - What are you doing? - I don't want you to go! You're out of line! Listen... ...l'm your boss' woman. Don't let me see you again. - She's going to the airport tonight. - Hello? Hello? Kwun was killed by me. If a man treats me well, I'll do anything. TIME File number l03142 - Inspector Wong's murder conspiracy. This is the 11th internal hearing. Inspector Wong, do you have any questions? No. No. On April 11th 1995, the Department received this tape which accused you of conspiring in a murder. I confess, sir. What happened to you? If I told you that the evidence is insubstantial... ...would you like to start over again? Sorry. I broke the law. I'm grateful to all of you... ...but I've lost my confidence. I've lost. What about Luk? You owe it to him not to give up now. Wong, the war isn't over yet. We all want closure on all this. We want everyone to know that Hong Kong isn't run by the Ngais. Here is a file from Interpol. Take a look before your make up your mind. Have you ever been to a Thai funeral? A few months ago... ...I organised one for my wife. The monks prayed for three whole days. I didn't shed a single tear during those three days. On the day of burial... ...they left the casket in the living room. I was so mad. I wanted to beat someone up. The monk told me... ...it was a Thai tradition. The deceased... If we keep her company... ...for a little while... ...she will rest in peace. I asked the monk... "What if my wife wasn't in a coffin?" "Would she still rest in peace?" Sorry about your wife. The monk placed his hand here. He said, "It's no problem." "Your wife's in there." This is where... ...the Thais shot me. So I told myself... ...l've passed the point of no return. Going back to Hong Kong to testify against Hau will be very dangerous. I believe in you cos you're so handsome. I haven't heard that in a long time. Thank you. What's your plan? I'll do my best. It's no big deal. It's just a job. I'll leave Hong Kong when this is all over. Hey... You've changed. Baby! You cut it, didn't you? Nothing to say? Snort it all up! Don't go too far, Yan. It's bad for the boys' morale. Mr Ngai asked me to be in charge. If you don't like it, you can take him to hospital. Even if they do something wrong, they're still your elders. You still have lots to learn from them. Uncle John is retiring in a few years. You know what I mean? I don't want anything to happen. The Labour Association is holding a dinner tonight. All of us Political Consultative candidates are going. If everything works out... ...our family can come out of the shadows. How are you? When Solicitor Hung praised you, I couldn't believe my ears. You've achieved so much at a young age, Mr Ngai. What's your zodiac sign? - Ox. - Year of the Ox. Ox is good. Director Chan likes to be around young people. - I'll introduce you. - Thank you. Really? Director Chan told me he really hates the triads. That's right, Superintendent Leung. Mr Ngai's been asked to be a consultant to the police. Really? Congratulations! - Where were you playing golf? - Chong San. Chong San? What's your handicap? Mr Kwok. Mr Ngai Wing Hau. I'm Mr Ngai's solicitor. We're celebrating Hong Kong's handover. All other matters can wait. What if I say it can't? Do you have a problem? Mr Ngai. You're a suspect in several murder cases in 1995. You're under arrest. We're taking you into custody. Everything you say will be recorded and could be used as evidence. Any questions? No. I've looked at their files. The murder charges won't stand. However, I can't change the fact that you're a triad boss. The unions and political parties called earlier. They want to withdraw their invitations. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office have revoked your candidacy. Call Beijing. Get some friends to help. I'll try. Forget it. They've managed to find a dead man. Everyone knows how loyal Sam was to your family. Now he's the prosecution's witness. - Sorry, I can't help you. - You said it would be alright! Everyone is watching to see what we'll do. What now? What can I do? Threaten the government? He doesn't mean that. We're all in the same boat. I want to get off. I'm your solicitor, not one of you. I want to get off this boat. Sorry. Yes. Sam has a wife and daughter in Thailand. It's up to you what you do. Sister... ...you and our brothers should take Mum to Hawaii for a while. OK, we haven't been there for a while. - Are you going to be alright? - I'll be OK. Sorry, I can't help the family much. Don't be silly. We're a family! Take care of Mum. Don't worry. Leave it to us. I keep thinking, even if I testify... ...Hau will only get a few years. That's true. He'll have to kill you to get life. Hey... Thank you. I couldn't have come back to Hong Kong without you. I have to go. I'm pretty busy. If you need anything, just ask them. - They'll protect you. - OK. Sam. Thank you. So, how are you? Good. I've been transferred to CIB. I'll be an inspector in training next month. When Mary left... ...did she call you? Sam, don't be too hard on yourself. Inspector Wong told me... ...to ask for you if I need anything. Will you really help me? I thought you wouldn't come. Why wouldn't I? So... It's been two years. You didn't dare call me because you were involved in my father's murder. You couldn't face me? Right. All the evidence against Hau is in the safe. I've organised the files in date order. Why are you still willing to help me? I'm not helping you. I'm a cop. I've kept my promises to Superintendent Luk... ...and I don't want to be a mole any more. Another two years and I'll be one of the bosses. What for? To get arrested? Let's bury the past. Just hurry up and bring me back to the Department. Give me a desk. I want a sea view. But don't let me see you again. Don't worry. You won't see me again. One more thing... I couldn't spell some of the words. Find me if you can't understand it. Just don't mess up the order. It took me ages to sort it. I'll kill you if you mess it up! That'll be good. I'll be repaying my debt to you. You wish. Thank you, Officer. Sam, we have all the evidence. The trial will start in three days. Hello, OCTB. Inspector Wong! Sam's gone! Sam escaped through the kitchen. Who was guarding the kitchen? Sorry, sir. Inspector Wong, Sam made a call to Thailand before he escaped. Hello? Mr Ngai, what do you want me to do? You called me. So you can tell me what you can do to help me. Right? Sit. Kill me! Kill me and it's all over. Why would I? I haven't done that sort of thing for a long time. Everything can be negotiated, Sam. Hong Kong is big enough for the two of us to work together. Let's forget about the past. You'll definitely kill me. You'll kill me tonight. If I kill you, who's going to take care of your family? We just heard that Hau has take Sam's wife and daughter hostage. That's his Thai maid. I managed to stay alive these last few years... ...because I have some good friends in Thailand. You should take this call. It's from Hawaii. Your whole family's there. My Thai friends are too. Daddy? Where's Daddy? Mr Ngai! Shut up! I told you you'll kill me tonight. Ngai Wing Hau, put your gun down! Let him. He tried to kill me before. Let him do it again. Officers. After he shoots me... ...it's up to you if you shoot or not. "In this job, you'll always pay the price." Two questions. Did you kill his whole family? Of course not. My Thai friends and I were just scaring him. Did you expect me to kill him? Would you believe me if I said no? I thought I'd die here. I had no other choice. Sorry. Do you know how much time I spent collecting enough evidence to put him away for life? Who is it? It's that Thai guy, Sam. Paul. Thank you. That's good. We're partners now. The goods will come to Hong Kong. Shall I finish off the Ngais? Paul. Maybe we shouldn't go too far. If you hadn't bumped into me... ...you'd be dead. Don't worry I'm on your side, we're partners. We have to finish it. The handover ceremony of Hong Kong... ...commenced at 11:20. Both countries' military bands have performed. A British flag was raised in the hall. The ceremony was dignified and the atmosphere beforehand was peaceful. While both military bands played, some Chinese representatives took some photos. Prince Charles and Governor Patten were both smiling as they arrived. The ceremony has officially commenced. Three British soldiers and three Chinese soldiers carrying the Chinese flag march slowly up to the podium. The Chinese soldiers present the People's Republic of China flag. Next, three Royal Hong Kong police officers emerge with three Hong Kong Special Administrative Region officers. The three SAR police officers present the Hong Kong SAR flag to the honourable Chinese guests. All the guests rise at this time. It is exactly midnight, July 1st 1997. The People's Republic of China flag and the Hong Kong SAR flag rise slowly... ...marking the end of the colonial era. It also signifies the beginning of the One Country Two Systems policy. The Hong Kong SAR of the People's Republic of China has been established. OK, that's settled. Join me officially. You know what kind of bosses are the worse? The ugly ones. Looks are everything. What's your name, miss? What's your name, miss? Name... I think... Mary. Mary. Mary. M-A... M-A-Y... M-A-R-Y. I think... it's M-A-R-Y.
