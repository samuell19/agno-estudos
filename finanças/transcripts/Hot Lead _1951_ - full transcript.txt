[INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] What are you doing here, Bob? Thought I told you to count cattle in the south meadow. Sure, Tim, I counted 'em, but there's only 280 head. Two hundred and eighty? Something wrong. - Did you count the yearlings. - Yep. I counted everything. Well, some of 'em must have drifted over the hill. Want me to start looking for 'em? Yes, right away. You better take Chito with you. - Chito? - Well, sure, what's the.. - He is there, isn't he? - Well.. [HORSE TROTTING] Hello, Gail. This is a pleasant surprise. It isn't often the boss pays her hired hands a visit. This isn't a visit, Tim. I'm looking for Chito. Where is he? Well, he was over in the south meadow helping count cattle. - Wasn't he, Bob? - Well, I.. You don't have to cover for him, Bob. I was just over at the south meadow. - He wasn't there. - I see. I'm sorry, Gail. I'll have a talk with him. Probably left his job again to chase women. Well, I'll.. I'll find him, just leave it to me. What did you want him for? The new furniture I ordered is arriving on this afternoons train. I wanted him to go to railroad station and pick it up for me. Oh. Bob, why don't you take the rig in to town and pick it up. Alright, Tim. I'll take Miss Gail back to the ranch. On second thought, you'd better go with him. And on the way you can find Chito and fire him. - You mean like the last time? - No. This time I mean it. Yes, Miss Martin. Orders are orders. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [MUSIC CONTINUES] But are you sure he's in there. Wherever you find women you'll always find Chito. Where do you find women? In the saloon. Saloon, Chito. I'll ride over to the railroad station. I'll meet you there. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Oh, Rosita, you're the most beautiful chiquita in the whole world. Pretty soon I am rich and I have lot's of cattle, and then I-- Then, Chito, we'll get married, no. Married? Rosita, please do not put the words in my mouth. Oh, chiquita mia, when I'm with you I can think of nothing but-- - 'Cows.' - Si cows.. Cows! What do you mean by that? Because that's where you're suppose to be with the cows. Well, I am, I mean.. Chito, what are you calling me a cow? No, Rosita. This Tim, he gets me all excited. You let me handle this, this is between Tim and me. Oh! Now, you see what you've done you get me in trouble with Rosita. You think that's trouble. I've got news for you. - You're fired. - You do that to me? Me your amigo who has been with you through thin and thick together. I'm not firing you. Miss Martin is. Oh, she won't fire me. I can handle women. Yes, but can you handle furniture? Furniture? We're going on the railroad station just to see how good you are. Come on, Romeo. [TRAIN CHUGGING] [HORN BLARING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Keep your hands down and you won't get hurt. And don't turn around. Open the safe. Keep your hands down and don't yell. Hurry it up! [MUSIC CONTINUES] There's no gold in here. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUNSHOTS] Stay with Bob, Chito. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - How's he doing? - Not so good. - Did you call a doctor? - Si. He'll be here in a minute. It's no use, Tim. [GRUNTS] That gunslinger was... good. This is all my fault, Tim. Bob was doing my job. - Do you know who they were? - No. - What they look like? - I don't know. They wore a mask. The only thing I noticed with the fellow guarding me.. ...the side on his six-shooter was fire clean off. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Are you sure there was no gold in that express car. How many time do I have to tell you there was nothing valuable in there. We were just on a wild goose chase. I can't understand it. The gold's always been shipped from the San Francisco Mint to every bank in the territory over that railroad. That's right. But we don't know when the shipments are made. What do you expect us to do, hold up every train that comes into Trail Head. We've got to have a man in the telegraph office to tell us, when those gold shipments are coming through. Maybe we can get the president of the railroad to give us our own telegraph operator. Don't be funny. I was thinking of Dave Collins. Dave Collins? He's in prison. He was sent up for two years. Remember? I remember. He's been in for over a year but knowing Dave and his good behavior he should be getting out pretty soon. Maybe I can hurry up his parole. But how do you figure on finagling Dave Collins into that telegraph spot after the double-crossing we gave him. That'll come later. First I wanna make sure that Dave Collins will be traveling this way. Dakota, bring me that pen and paper. I'm gonna write a letter to the warden of State Penitentiary. Dear, Warden Lewis. [LEWIS] Come in. - You sent for me, warden? - Sit down, Collin. You know a rancher by the name John H Smith? Smith? No, sir. I don't think so. Well, he knows you. He's offering you a job on his cattle ranch when your parole comes through. Well, doesn't he know, I'm not a cowhand, I'm a telegrapher. Evidently makes no difference. He's even enclosed a stagecoach fare. If you wanna accept it, I think I can arrange it to the parole board. You've had a wonderful record here, Dave. Well, thanks, warden. Of course, I'll take the job and I'll do my best to make good. I don't believe you'd have been mixed up in that train hold up, if you'd have been more careful in choosing your friends. You're right, warden. I never wanna see that bunch again. One thing more. How are you going to explain to your mother? She thinks you own a ranch out here. Well, how did you know that, sir? Well, now, you know, that I have to sensor every letter send out by prison. Well, I guess the only thing I can do is write to her that I've sold my ranch here and brought one near Trail Head. I don't want her to ever know I've been in prison. Your mother will never find it out from me, son? I'll notify Rancher Smith that you're accepting his offer. - Thanks, warden. - You can go now. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUNSHOT] Drop your gun. Alright, you, Get out. - Who me? - Yes, you. Get out. Throw down his luggage. Get going, now. [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Stoney. Dakota. Relax, Dave, you're among friends. How'd you guys know I was on that stage? We put on that stage, kid. You're crazy, a man named John-- John H. Smith. It's just an alias for Turk Thorne. Then that letter was a forgery. He's a man of many talents. Well, he's wasted one of 'em on me. Not so fast. Thorne's picked out a real nice job for you. Doing what? Operating the telegraph at the railroad station Where all the gold shipments come through. Oh, I see, and all I have to do is tip him off when the shipment is coming through and you guys can knock it off, right? - Right. It'll be a cinch. - Not for me. I made one mistake and I paid for it. You can tell Thorne I'm through. Look, we got orders to bring you in to Thorne and we're gonna do it even if we have to drag you. That won't help you any? Listen. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You shouldn't have done it, you might have killed him. Oh, I didn't hit him so hard. Thorne said to make sure to bring in Collins. Well, this is one way to make sure. Come on, give me a hand, we'll put him on my horse. [MUSIC CONTINUES] We'll separate here, Chito. Some of the cattle may have wandered over the hill. Tim? - What's the matter? - Look. Let's go down and see what that's all about. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Well, he's not dead. It's a good thing we came along. I think we stopped a hold-up. But where'd he come from? Probably off the stagecoach. You know, the stage passes here about this time everyday. Yeah, but why rob him? Where're the others? I don't know, don't ask so many questions. You're right, Tim. That must be hombre's baggage's. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Chito, come here. What'd you find? Have you ever seen that neckerchief before? Well, how could I? I never loose it. Do you remember the train hold up? The men we chased from the railroad station. Oh, one of the hombre's was wearing it. So, now they're holding up stagecoach. It looks like it. Yeah, but they are passengers, why'd they take him off? Don't ask me those questions, Tim, I can't answer them. Besides they give me a headache. [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Is he hurt bad? - I don't know. We'll take him back to ranch. - There good as new. - Thank you, Miss.. Gail Martin. And this is Tim Holt and Chito Rafferty. Rafferty? With a bump like that on your head senor it's better that I don't explain the Rafferty part. Well, anyway, I wish there was some way I could repay you, for helping me out. You could repay us by telling us more about yourself. Well, there, isn't mush to tell. Let us be the judge of that. Those men who took you off the stagecoach. - Why they pick on you? - Well, I don't know. Did you ever see them before. No, I never saw 'em before in my life. You're a stranger in these parts. Where were you going? Well, I was on my way to Trail Head try and get a job. I'm from back east. Well, this is cattle country and you don't look like you know much about cattle. I'm afraid you're right, Miss Martin but I thought I'd try. I'm willing to learn. We need another hand around here. - You're hired. - You mean, you'd take a chance on me without knowing anything about me. That's right. Well, thanks, Holt. It won't take you long to learn the ropes. Come on, we'll show you around. Wait a minute, Tim, I want a word with you. Starting a school for cowhands? Not exactly. That man Collins's lying. He's holding back and he's trying to cover up something. But what? He told us he didn't know the bandits. They may have mistaken him for someone else. I don't think so. They stopped that coach for a purpose. They wanted him and they were gonna take him someplace. Tim, I think you are over suspicious. Collins seems nice. Hmm, I agree with you there, Gail, but.. Well, I know I just have a hunch that through him we're gonna find out who killed Bob Jackson. Oh... So that's why you gave him the job. I wanna keep my eye on him for a while because if those men tried to get him once they may try it again. I see. Well, it's pretty slim, but it's the only thing we've hit on so far. And if we're wrong, who knows? We might make him a pretty fair cowhand. I hope so. Where is Collins? Wasn't he on the stagecoach? - He was there, alright. - Well, what happened to him? - Why isn't he here? - We took him off the stagecoach then we ran into those two meddling cowpokes again. Yeah, they took Dave away from us we didn't have a chance. Look, Collins is important to our set up we can't let our scheme fail because of those cowpokes. We know, we did our best. - What do you suggest now? - We gotta find him. Find out who those cowpokes are? We can't let Collins get away. - Pick up everything? - Si. Let's go on back to ranch. Tim, do we have to go back so soon. Why can't I stay in town for a little while? So you can go back to the saloon get mixed up with Rosita again. Well, what's wrong with that? Can I help it, if the girls like me? Are you sure it isn't the other way around? Well, speaking of girls. The letter for Collins. It's in a women's handwriting. "St. Louis." [SNIFFING] No perfume. It's not like the kind I get. Wait a minute. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Stoney, those are the two that took Collins away from us. Yeah, we better follow 'em. Maybe we can get a line on Collins that way. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Well, I'd better get back to work before Tim fires me. Just let him try. I'm boss around here. Just the same. I've got a job to do. - Then I'll see you tonight. - Right. Oh, Dave. Thought I told you to watch the cattle in the south meadow. Well, I was, but Miss Gail came by and asked me to ride in with her. Was that wrong? Well, the herd shouldn't be left unguarded. Well, I'm sorry, Tim, I'll get back there right away. Now, wait a minute. You know I picked up the mail in town. Here's a letter for you. Well, thanks, Tim. Well, aren't you got to open it? No, I'll wait till I get back to the herd. I've been going too long already. Say, Dave, that letter couldn't be from some little senorita in St. Louis who's getting lonesome for you? Not exactly, Chito, it's from my mother. You see, I've been writing home that I've gone into the ranching business near Trail Head. Matter of fact, I lied a little I told her I bought the Circle Bar. Well, a little white lie can't do you any harm. You go on and get back to work, we'll see you later. Right. He likes his work. He takes the ranching like a fly to water. Like a fly to sugar, Chito. A duck takes to water. Well, that's what I said. Duck to sugar. Come on. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] That's Dave alright. Sure. He's been working out here to Circle Bar all the time. He never even left Trail Head. He's all alone. You want me to go down there and grab him? No. You tried force once, it got you nowhere. Make him loose his job. When he's good and hungry, he'll be more that happy to join up with us. What you want us to do? Rustle the cattle? We're not in that business. I don't want you to rustle 'em, I want you to stampede them. But first, you'll have to get Collins away from the herd so they'll blame him for it. I'm going down to the telegraph office so I'll handle that end of it. You boys figure out a way to get Collins away from the cattle. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Look, Stoney, he's leaving. Yeah. That's perfect, just what we wanted. Hold it. Wait a while. You wanna make sure he's out of gun sound. We don't want him coming back. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Now. [GUNSHOTS] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [INDISTINCT YELLING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INDISTINCT YELLING] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [INDISTINCT YELLING] Just a moment. Are you leaving? Yep, going to lunch. Well, I wanted to send a telegram. Sorry, I'm a little late now. My Matilda don't like me to keep her waiting. Well, this is important for me I must send a wire right now. Can you do me the favor? Well, alright, stranger. Guess, Matilda, won't get too angry not after 38 years. [LAUGHS] You'll find blanks over on the counter there. Just write out your message. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Oh, I'm sorry. Kinda nervous, ain't you, stranger? [MUSIC CONTINUES] [MUS[GUNSHOTS]es] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOTS] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] Tim, this one of the hombre's that worked on stagecoach. Where is Dave Collins? What you do with him? I don't know what you're talking about. Why did you stampede our cattle? Alright, Chito, we'll take him back to ranch. Go on. What's this all about, Tim? I'm not sure, Gail. This man stampeded your cattle. We're taking him to the sheriff. - What about Dave? - He wasn't around? Afraid I was wrong about him. - Where is he? - I don't know. Looks like he's still working with that gang. He left the cattle alone, so they could be stampede. Don't be hasty, Tim, maybe he was ambushed or lured away before they attack. Si,Dave is still a tender horn. It's tenderfoot, Chito. Greenhorn. Well, it's the same difference that's what I said. Greenfoot. Why don't you give him the benefit of the doubt. At least, until you find him. Maybe, you're right, Gail. We'll try and locate him. - Where's Sheriff Lacy? - Oh, he went down to the railroad station to send a telegram. Lock this man up. We just caught him trying to rustle some cattle. We'll settle with the sheriff later. Alright. Oh, he's out to lunch, huh? Yeah, I've been waiting for him to get back. If I were you I'd leave your message too. Old Man Dukes sometimes is pretty slow about getting back from lunch. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hey, Tim, that was Dave. Sure in a hurry. Muy pronto. Sure acting peculiar. Let's go and have a look around. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Chito. You think Dave killed him? I don't know, but you better get the sheriff. But what about Dave? We'll have the let the law take care of him. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Miss Gail, I couldn't leave without saying goodbye. You're going away? But why? I'm sorry, I can't explain, but it's best that I go. What is it? You're hiding something. - Tell me, I'm your friend. - I know you are. You've all been wonderful to me. Believe me, it's not easy for me to leave. - Look, Tim, he's running away. - Sure. - 'Cause he killed Old Man Duke. - But I didn't kill him. Then why are you running away? And why did you leave the heard unguarded? Go on, Dave, tell us. We maybe able to help you. Well, I went to town to send a telegram to my mother to stop her form coming here. But why? She'd be welcome. Oh, you don't understand, Miss Gail I've been writing home that I own this ranch. You told me that once, go ahead. Well, I was about to send the telegram when I saw the operator dead. I got scared and ran. Well, if you didn't kill him, you didn't have to run. But the sheriff saw me in the telegraph office. I'm and ex-convict. I have a prison record. So that's why you didn't tell us more about yourself. Well, you gave me a chance at a new life, Miss Gail I didn't wanna risk losing it. Now, all I've done is bring you a lot of trouble, Tim. Running from trouble won't get rid of it, you know. Could help you avoid a lot of grief. Turk Thorne and his men probably stampeded your cattle. Probably killed the telegraph operator. Why kill a kindly old man? Well, because they want me in his place. They're planning another big job and they'll stop at nothing to get me to join them. Just how far would you go to stop them? I'd do anything. I was innocently involved with him once before I don't want to get mixed up with him again. Alright, Dave, I believe you. Come on, Chito, we're going back to town to see the sheriff. The sheriff? Don't worry, we're not gonna turn Dave in. I have an idea. I think with Dave's help we can put it across. Only you see that he doesn't run away. That will be a pleasure, Mr. Holt. Dave Collins, you are now in my protective custody. You want me to let that convict take the job at the telegraph office. Well, what do you have to lose, sheriff? We don't know where Thorne hides out Dakota hasn't talked. Don't you see it's our one chance of getting Thorne. Tim, I think it's a crazy idea we'll just be playing into their hands. Why don't you give it a try anyway. Alright, Tim. Alright, I'll try it. But if anything goes wrong I'll hold you and Chito responsible. You mean, I may end up in your Calabasas, sir? Well, this is all your idea. [HORN BLARING] [BELL TOILING] No sign of Thorne yet? Maybe he's afraid to show up. Whatever the reason is, we're gonna go ahead with our plan. Give me the gun, Chito. - Now you know what to do? - Yeah. - You still want to go through with it? - More than ever. Alright. Good luck. Just hope my little scheme works. Telegram for you, sheriff. Wait a minute. Let's see if there's an answer. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Hey, sheriff, I'm thirsty. Get me a drink of water. Can't you see I'm busy? You can wait. I'll get it for him, sheriff. Okay, go ahead. It's alright, there's no answer. - Thanks just the same. - Okay. Make a move, sheriff, and I'll blow your head off. - Where'd you get that gun? - Never mind. Unbuckle your gun belt. Get those keys and let me out. [GUNSHOTS] [INTENSE MUSIC] Thanks, Collins. Just get that message to Thorne. [MUSIC CONTINUES] So far so good. Senor Badge is not here. I'm back here. It's a good thing that gun was loaded with blanks - or I wouldn't be here. - Did Dakota find out they were blanks? No, I made it look good. Well, so far it's working perfectly. It has to work all the way, Tim. I don't exactly share your faith in this Dave Collins. I know that. But you can trust us. And if that killer isn't in your hands by tomorrow morning we'll turn Dave over to you as we promised. I won't feel easy till this is over with. But I'll have my men at the railroad station tomorrow morning, as I promised. Well, don't worry about us, Senor Badge we'll be there too also. [GALLOPING] Dakota. How did you get out? Filled the sheriff full of lead. Where'd you get the gun? Who slipped it to you? - Guess who? - Come on tell us. Don't play cat and mouse. Who? Dave Collins. - Collins? - Yeah. He's taken the job at the telegraph office. He's working with us. Your plan was alright. He sent you this note. That gold shipment. It's coming through. We've waited a long time for it. You say you broke out, huh? Anybody hear the gunshots? - No. - Where'd you get the horse? - Collins had it for me. - Were you chased? No. If I was they wouldn't have been able to follow me here. I don't like it. This could be a double cross. What makes you so suspicious? Everything you planned is working out. You got the information about the gold shipment. That kid's working at the railroad station-- Answer me one question. What made him change his mind? How should I know. Why don't you go ask Collins. I plan to. Come on. What're you gonna do, Thorne? Find Collins and talk this thing over. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] I had a wonderful evening. I'm glad you dropped down to the ranch. I couldn't stay away. Isn't it pretty? It's perfect. Well, how are things out in my ranch? Oh, that's perfect too, except for one thing. What's that? What do I do when your mother gets here? Hadn't you better invent some excuse for a young single girl at your ranch. Oh, my gosh. I never thought of that. What'll I do? Don't worry about it, I'll think of something when she gets here. I hope mom doesn't embarrass you. - How could she? - Well, you're just the kind of girl she's always wanted me to marry. She's liable to come right out and ask you too. Oh, that's fine. But you'll have to speak for yourself John Olive. Gail.. [HORSE GALLOPING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Well, what a pleasant surprise. Sure glad to see you, Dave. Haven't seen you in a long time. Well, aren't you going to introduce me? An old friend. Miss Martin, this is Turk Thorne. Sure is a pleasure, ma'am. Dave, I thought you were working in the telegraph office. Instead I find you out with the girl who fired you. I am working there. Didn't Dakota give you my message? Yeah, I got the message alright, but.. That's what bothers me. I'm not too sure how authentic it is. You know, Dave, in our business we have to be very very careful. Dave, why don't you take me back to the ranch - it's getting late. - Just a moment. You're not going back to the ranch. Stoney. Dakota. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You're going with us. Stoney, change places with Collins. Now, look here, Thorne, I don't want to get Miss Martin mixed up in this. Hold it, Dave, we better do what they say. You're being very sensible, Miss Martin. Alright, get going, Stoney. [INTENSE MUSIC] Tim. Tim! Tim. - Tim. Tim. - What is it, Chito? Dave, Gail, they enveloped I think. Envelope? What are you talking about? You know what I mean. Run away, get hitched. Get married. Oh, stop it. Whatever gave you that crazy idea? What's crazy about it? For a long time I see the light of love and romance burning in the eyes of those two. Come on. Get to the point. Well, last night they slipped away into the beautiful night. And Dave he said to Gail.. Stop the trimming. Just say what you're trying to say. Well, if I'm not right then where is Dave and where's Gail? I don't know. Dave didn't come home last night. Neither did Gail and neither did the buckboard. They wouldn't pick a time like this to get married. Dave isn't even clear of the murder charge yet. Oh, see, that is the reason for Senor Cupid to shoot his arrow. Nothing touches a senorita's heart more than a lover in trouble. I still don't believe it. Dave was supposed to have opened his office early this morning. We needed him there to help with the ambush. Now, see, this I forgot. Now, let's see if we can find him. Brent, Joe, get the horses and hide 'em behind the bushes. Jack, you hide in the waiting room. Kenny, get behind the freight house. I'll be in the telegraph office. [HORSES GALLOPING] Well, we're all set, Tim. Sheriff, has Dave Collins been here. Why, no. I thought he was coming with you boys to help set the trap. Where is he? Why didn't you bring him? We couldn't. He's missing. - Something's gone wrong. - Missing. Now, don't jump to conclusions. I know it looks bad for Dave, but Gail Martin is missing too. She didn't come home last night. I don't know what connection Gail has with this but you know what I think? Collins will never be here. Once a jail bird always a jail bird. Oh, he's not that kind of a person,Senor Badge. - He cannot fly. - I think you're wrong, sheriff. Come on, Chito, we're gonna find Gail. And when we do she'll be able to throw some light on what's happened. Oh, no you don't. You said you'd be responsible for Collins appearance. Well, he's not here. I'm taking you two back to jail. Jail? You see, Tim, I told you we should've handled this ourselves. You're right, Chito. We will. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] You agreed to layoff Dave for a chance to nab the Thorne gang. Well, we still have a little time left? You're only making it worse, Tim. Just getting yourself in deeper. Uh, you're wrong,Senor Badge he's keeping me out of your jail. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hey, Jack, Kenny. Come on! [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNFIRE] [GUNSHOTS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOT] [GUNFIRE] [INTENSE MUSIC] This is an awful mess of fish, Tim. What do we do now? We have to figure out where Gail and Dave went last night. Tell me, Romeo. Where would you go to propose to a girl? See, I think you got something there. - I know the most beautiful-- - Hold up. Tell me after we get away from here. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Thorne, will you please let Miss Martin go? Not until Stoney comes back from the railroad station. I'm not taking any chances. But I tell you, it's not a trap. If it isn't, then you have nothing to worry about. - Why back so soon? - I didn't have to go all the way into town. I ran into a little surprise. Those two meddlin' cowpokes were being chased by the sheriff and his men. Sheriff? I thought you said you filled him full of lead? I thought I did. I saw him go down. Then I was right, you thought you could trick me? I'm not trying to trick you, Thorne. That shipment arrives today. I don't believe anything you say. Look, Thorne, if it was a trap the sheriff isn't at the railroad station. That gold shipment will be there in an hour. It'll be the easiest pickings we've ever had. I'm not so sure there is a gold shipment. But Collins might be right about that part of it. You sure that gold is coming through? I'm positive. Alright! But you're going with us. And if there isn't any gold in that express car you know what'll happen to you. Dakota, you're gonna stay here and keep an eye on her. Go on, Dave. We haven't any time to waste. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Look, Thorne, if I'm goin' with you hadn't I better have a gun? You won't need a gun, Dave, for your part of it. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] If you think you're goin' some place, forget it. You're right, Chito, those are buckboard tracks. I see, but which way did they go? I don't know. The tracks weren't all made by that wagon team, either. Looks like some men came in on horseback here and joined them and they all went out together in that direction. Uh, this looks very bad, Tim. Let's just hope we can follow 'em. Will you stop that pacing? I'm hungry. How about starting a fire and rustling up some breakfast? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] That's the old Henderson place. I know. It's been deserted for years. It's a perfect place for a hideout. But there are no horses around, and where are the riders? I don't know. Let's have a look anyway. Oh, it's not use looking. We'd be wasting our time. If they were holding Gail down there they'd be somebody around. Come on, let's look in another place. Wait a minute, Chito. Look! Smoke. [MUSIC CONTINUES] You see what I told you, Tim you should never leave a stone upturned. Never mind that, they are holding her and now you know what to do, don't you? - Si give 'em the old one too. - Right. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Well, that's more like it. Now hurry up with that coffee. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GUNSHOTS] Chito, tie him up. I'm glad that you're safe. Where's Dave? He's gone to the railroad station to hold-up that train. But what's gonna happen when they open the safe and they don't find anything-- I know, Tim. Can't you do something? Thorne's a killer and Dave doesn't stand a chance. We'll do what we can, Gail. Get your buckboard and go find the sheriff. Where will I find him? This man Stoney said he was chasing you. The last time that we saw him, he was in Sycamore Pass. Chito and I are going down to the railroad station and see if we can help Dave. Come on, Chito. What's the matter, Collins? Nothin'. Where are you goin'? What are you tryin' to do? Well, I've got to go into the telegraph office and change into my stationmaster's uniform, don't I? You want me to stop that train for you, don't you? That's right. [CLICKING] Don't answer that. It may be a message about the gold shipment. We'll take our chances. We know the gold is coming through. Whatever you say. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] There she is. Right on time. Collins, get out there and flag her down. Make sure they open up that baggage car. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] [TRAIN CHUGGING] [BELL CHIMING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Come on, open that safe. But, but-but there's nothing in there. Open that safe. We know the gold shipment's in there. Gold shipment? You must be mistaken. - What did you do that for? - Well, he was stalling. I'll open it up for you. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hurry it up, Dave! What takes you so long? They must've changed the combination. - We're too late. - I don't think so. [MUSIC CONTINUES] [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC CONTINUES] - Are you hurt? - No! Chito, where's the other one? [STONEY GRUNTING] Let me see that gun. Alright, you. Come on. So, I finally caught up with you. Put the handcuffs on him. Oh,Senor Badge, you're all wrong. Wait a minute, sheriff. Here's the man you want. His name is Turk Thorne. His gun will hang him for the murder of Bob Jackson and Old Man Dukes. You mean, while I was out looking for you-- - Did Miss Gail find you? - Well, no. Soon as we lost you, we came right back here. Excuse me, fellas, I'm gonna find Miss Martin and give her the good news. You better send a couple of men to pick up Dakota. You'll find him at the old Henderson place, tied up. Come on, you. Take him along, boys. Here's another one, Senor Badge. Where? - Well, who's he? - I don't know. I was never introduced to him. Come on, you. Take him along. Can you imagine that Senor Badge bein' so stupid? He's still wanting to arrest us. You know, Tim, I don't think I'd vote for him in the next election. Why do you have to leave so early? Your mother doesn't arrive for a couple of hours. I'm sorry, Gail, I'm just nervous. You know, if mom ever finds out that I don't own this ranch or that I lied to her-- Oh, she won't find out. Because if I had my way... Well, Dave, your troubles are over. Thorne's finally out of your hair. The sheriff just shipped him off to jail. Si,when I was at the railroad station I picked up a telegram for you. I hope it isn't bad news. Mother isn't coming here after all. My sister Ellen's baby arrived sooner than expected. That's fine, because when she does arrive you'll really be the owner of Circle Bar Ranch. Sounds like a wedding. I think I kiss the bride. Come on, Romeo. We have work to do. If it's romance you want.. ...go romance those cows. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] Every time I go up to kiss a girl you have to interfere with me. What is there in life for me, but to ro-romance the senoritas. You are the one to go out and romance the cows. I think you're crazy or something. The last time I was at the saloon I was with Rosita you had to come and get me. I'm gettin' sick and tired of you putting your nose in my business. When I need you, you're never around. It's alright for you to stick around with me, but I don't ask you what you do in your spare time. It's alright, but I don't like it. I'll tell you that. Every time I go around with a girl you have to come on over and poke your nose in my business. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC]
