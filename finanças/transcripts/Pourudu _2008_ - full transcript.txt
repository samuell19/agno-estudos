What do you think all the time? I want to see Ajay once. We know your pain. Let's get together. Yes. If we go together the police will find us. Not just that. I do not know if Ajay will want to talk to me. I'll go alone. Why Dubai Ansari arrived here again? Greetings. Rs. 10 crores advance. This is a black list.. Dubai Asif said to give you personally. What about our drug business, all the partners are from Dubai. The goods will be on time. What about him? This is Mukherjee. My partner of Mumbai. Since the police in Mumbai had become very strict, moved his record label counterfeit money to Singapore. counterfeit money? The money that you gave my boss are false? How dare cheat Zakir Bhai? I know how it is powerful when teamed up with Kasi. When you gave me a return ticket I was afraid that it is a bomb. I went to the airport i saw surprised call for interest to you. You are a master of the intellect. -We have made a serious mistake. The inclusion in our business Kasi'ego is a big mistake. I agreed to do a deal with him because of you. You thought was that his strength will be helpful for us. I feel sad doing it. Whatever it is, we have to be careful. We arrange meeting in Delhi. Since Pandu is not here, we could meet here. Are you afraid of Pandu? -I'm not afraid. I need it. For the past 25 years, people worship me as God. There were two reasons for this state of affairs. First -Pandu believes in me. Second -People believe in Pandu. So we could continue our case, I need faith in me wild dogs such as Pandu. Where did you get this wild dog? 30 years ago, the settlers threatened to Chintalbasti, to slow down their lands and homes. because I did not listen, commanded my people burn their houses. I saved a few people so no one would suspect me. One of them was Pandu. He still believes in me so much because I saved his life. He made Kapali'ego Pandu killed. Because he was the only witness murders committed by my boss. You can go. Pozrowienia. Greetings. -Greetings Bhai. Pandu, are you shocked? This is what you see here is the truth. I do not like this type of work. I can not do it. Well, I left it Mastan'owi. Pandu, you are a good man. But you're not smart. I would not understand as well. You're right. I'm not smart. I'm a fool. If I was smart, why would you like to worship God? And why would I make to trust these people? Why would I want to be separated from her son? Why should I respect Your words and not his? Shut up. You have no right to speak my name. I was proud that I am a man Zakir'a Bhai. But you did me a wild dog. This wild dog pull you down. Beware! you know only one thing. you and your Bhai. You will worship him? -But He is my God. What if Pandu goes to the police? Kasi, it's me. Yes, Bhai. Pandu knows about us. He retired as a mad dog. We need to kill the dog even if it is ours. Dad? -I want to see at least once. I want to talk to you. -Tell me where you are. I'll be there. Why are you looking at me? Let me look at you. My head is now calm. You're not mad at me, are not you? Why would I be angry? You caused problems since childhood. Problems came to you by mistake. But you were right all the time. I could not be a good father. No, Dad. You?ve always been a good father. You say that because you're a good son. God made a mistake. He should make me your son and you're my father. You took good care of me. Why do you act like a child? Yes, I am a child of the moment. I'll do what you say. If you do something wrong, or bad, and even my bit up. Ajay, please forgive me. Father... Father... Father, you will be all right. Father... If something happens to you stay the same. Ajay, call me if you only need me. Ajay, the death must be left alone. You have to live a normal life. You need to think again about his life. -Yes Ajay. My mom was talking with his friend. You have a chance to re join the qualification. Do not miss the chance. The past is a curse. Future is a boon. Now you need to focus on your goal. Still can not believe that Pandu was dead. Usually filmed in the city with him. Wherever I go, I just think about it. There was nothing we could do to find the killers. Bhai also sitting quietly. It Pandu brothers. They do not have the energy. No Pandu, are like nomads. You have completed the rites? Urzadziliscie party for everyone? We offer you party. After Pandu soul will rest in peace. -What is this gibberish? You call her dead Pandu? Here it is. Pandu, come and save his boys. come? Call him. Call your Pandu. Ask that you saved. Call him. Call him. Ajay Bhai's birthday today. That's why decorations. How is it? When you're wrong, you look like me. Yes, Father. I look just like you. How are you, Ajay? How was your interview? I got another chance to complete the qualification. But there are unfinished business that I need to finish. What? They need to die. I have to kill them. Everyone responsible for the death of my father must die. I have to kill them. I do not want anyone to save. I know the killers. I've seen them. Kasi and his son Suri. They killed my father. Thanks be to God. I beat people Kasi'ego to warn him. But this is just a taste of what awaits them. -Even our boys said the same thing. Why fight unnecessarily? Ajay, what happened to your goal? I belong to the system, to be in the public service. Now, I understand that the IAS and IPS (Indian Police Service) are useless. Anyone can serve the public in such a manner that it considers fair. Not only the guys who killed my father, but the criminals who cause trouble to other people, not spare anyone! I'll kill all of and clean city! these hands. It is now my goal. If I could take revenge, It was the biggest public to justice. I understand your grief. But why do you want to get involved in all this? I got it. Leave it to me. I know you're capable of doing anything. I know that my father blindly trust you. I know that no one can save, I've decided to join you and do my job. There Ajay... -Bhai Please do not refuse me. I see my Pandu on your every word and deed. My Pandu went nowhere, is here with me. Hey, guys! Were you sad the loss of Pandu. Look, he's here... Take it and enjoy. Go... go... brother Pandu. I was afraid that he had come to attack us, and he came to join you? Until yesterday, the trust Pandu was our weapon from now on a revenge Ajay is our weapon. * Hey, sir! Blink at me... * I have a lot to do with you... * Come and dance with me... * My heart wants more... * Give it to me, my dear... * eyes have burned with fire... * Taking the arms as you squeeze the lasso... * You are between the devil * a deep sea... * There's no escape... * Give it to me... * If the cat in the corner zapedzisz * i will torture him... * Whether he will not attack back like a tiger? * Do not take it for the falling rain... * When there is a chance, * does not drown you in a flood? * turned docile * in the direction of a powerful... * He will not rest until * if your head gets... * The enemy is his goal... * War is the only way... * Even God can not stop it * The power of the warrior raged... * Create bonds was his happiness... * He still remembers the same man... * When you stop to create bonds, * if he does not use it against you? * When I went to the right * without worrying about others... * Do not set the injustice * hurdles in his way? * Revenge is his weapon... * Courage is the ammunition... * Wherever you hide, * your end is in his hands... Tell me, Kasi. Is Ajay mad? It kills my people like street dogs. I also heard about it. You've heard or maybe you ordered? -You're right, Kasi. It was a mistake to do business with you. Now this repair. I'll tell you clearly. I have used your anger at the Pandu you killed him. Now I use anger Ajay it would kill you. Then, the whole city will be mine. Bhai, call me and commanded me to kill Pandu. If I say it Ajay'owi... Kasi, you'll be dead before you utter a word. You left my house without informing us. You stopped seeing me, do not answer my calls also... Do you want to go with my life? You changed completely. You forgot about their studies. Have you forgotten about your goals. You forgot about me too. -Please listen to me. I know what you say. There is no place for me in your new life I need to forget everything about you, I do not and never show my face you again, I have to marry someone else and go somewhere far away. This is what you want, right? Yes. I loved you so much I wanted to spend with you all my life. I love you more than you love me. If you want to live happily, you have to be away from my life. You finished your photo session? How's your hand, sir? Forget about my hands, let's talk about this land. The new Commissioner of he gave me a free hand. In the city there are two forces nasty... One is Bhai... deceives people under the guise of God for the poor. The second is Kasi, liquor baron... Which sits well in the drug trade and was accused... of being involved in human trafficking in Dubai. What about Ajay? I know and you know what happened, and what happens. I know what's going to happen. We eliminate all three. I take the city under his control. I expected that Ajay is killed by CI after the death of his father, But Hussain directed weapons in our direction. Are we now also his fear? Let us not be blind to the world. Use your brain... When the time is bad we need to be afraid of even police dogs. How much we have to fear in this case the police officers? It is not safe to be here now Clear out the place first. -Where will we go? I'll tell you where you go. Now, you look very handsome. I was very happy to see you on TV. Do not try to use your magic on me. I give you only two chances... Give up and become an informant, either die a challenge with Zakir Bhai and Ajay. Where else can you find such a good cop who in addition gives advice? Your advice is only for our own good. Take your first board. You came to arrest us because you can not arrest Ajay? Shut up! We're lucky that we see Hussain'a first, before Ajay. In the current situation, the central prison is the safest place for us. We'll go wherever we take. What does that mean? Why do I have to leave the battlefield Ajay fear of like my dad? Goodbye Dad! Do pass. It's time for you, you met with your father. Hussain, he's going to kill my son! Not ashamed to give weapons of criminals? I'm proud! That's the sound of a gun shot... which comes from the hand of a distinguished man. I watched you kill my father, Now you'll look like me kill your son. I killed Suri'ego and brought this... disgusting guy here to kill him in front of you. But he's trying to tell me something a long time. You may fall at my feet I spared his life. I have removed the gag? Why should we listen to him? Kill him! Kill him Ajay. I have to kill Bhai! I have to kill them all. What is Kasi? Fight to tell me something. I know your last words. Just as people think Bhai is no God. This is a dangerous criminal. Is that what you say is true? Illegal interests gravitate to his command. Is that what you say is true? Bhai is cheating... Bhai means crimes... Bhai is treason... Actually, Bhai ordered to kill my father! It's your last words, right? I knew about this a long time. At the moment when my father came after he learned about you kill it with Kasi'ego. But I know one thing. Before you came to me, he met with a man... I was cheated Hussain. I wish I was part of a crime syndicate, belonging to Bhai as his supporter. My business Ajay'owi ruined lives. I'll meet him again and admit a mistake. And then I come back to surrender. Bhai will turn against the informant and give up. The date on which Hussain told me, I wanted to kill you instantly. But we have planned to kill you along with all your evil empire. As planned, I joined you. Ajay, it makes it more difficult for me to die as straight as Kasi. Six bullets in the gun, Three for Suri and three for Kasi. Just like you said Bhai, do not die so easily. I will not let you die so easily. I'd like you to be arrested. But I know that you use the their influence to get out into the wild and rule as king of the city again. That's why I have chosen the way, contrary to... his principles. To bring about a change in the system, I must eliminate such frauds like you. Eliminate! Please ask him to forgive me and saved my life. Tell him Saira. I told him a long time ago what I want. You killed Pandu, and though you were my husband, you deserve to be punished. No Ajay, do not run away after killing me. A system that does not have for respect save... you when you kill me. A system that was under your control is now in my power. Kasi and Bhai died in wasting both parties fight gangs. It's tomorrow's main message in the media. Ajay went to Delhi to complete his training to IAS. Kill Ajay... Your future is waiting for you. Ajay luck. Greetings, sir.
