- There's Oppermann, come. - Okay. Stop. - Let's stay here. - Yes, just a bit further. - Is it working? - Calm down. - Are you ready? - Just a moment. One second. - Turn on the camera. - It's rolling. - Luckily we didn't miss that. - Yes. - There is Lauterbach. Come. - Okay. Excuse me, sir! Mister Lauterbach! Just one moment. - Yes? - Just a short statement. Not so close with the camera. Otherwise you're on screen with us. Do we want to go over there? Here is good enough, no? There is good. - Okay, you got it? - Wait. Still focusing. - Okay. - Now? Mister Lauter... - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. Good. The Left! I will take the tripod over here. Come. Great. - Excuse me?

Just a short statement, ok? Thank you. We need it just for the camera. Are you done? Still focusing. - Miss Wagen... Thank you. - No problem. Shit. Well, what should I say? Shit, I'm sorry. - I'm gonna see what Reuters has. - Nothing with Lauterbach. - But with Wagenknecht. - I need Lauterbach. - Okay. - I think Wagen is... Shut up! Hey, don't freak out. It can happen. I don't want to discuss it with you anymore. You can't even see if the camera is on. On... Off. What a great artist! Gosh, what a funny guy. How did it happen? Can you get me a coffee? I'm having a problem with my cash flow at the moment. I give it back to you tomorrow, ok? - Cappuccino? - Yes. - Long time no see. - True. - Aren't you a bit too old to be here? - I'm younger than the DJ. Asshole. - Oh no! Hey! - Hey. Hey. This is Armin a friend from my mom. He put us in. - Hi. - Hey. Woah! Man! Shit. That's a sign, let's go somewhere else. What are you afraid of? - Yes! Table, chair, bed. It's been a long time since the maid came. Cool! I would love to live here. - How much do you pay? - 370 bucks. That's really good. - How long you live here? - Oh, you don't want to know that. I think we should make out. Test. And? Wait. So? - Where is the light? - Here. - Do you have any preferences? - What you mean? Well, if you like something specific. I don't have any romantic ballads. What is this? May I use your toothbrush? - Are you serious? - Why? Hold on. We have more bacteria in our mouth than in our ass. - Ask your dentist. - But am I supposed to suck your cock? Brush your teeth first. - I think I have to go home. - Really? Bye. Wait. I really have to go. - Come here... - No. - For real? - For real. - Bye. - Bye. - Yes. Long time no see. My bag. Bye. Are you with her? Can you pass the phone to her? Is that ok? Yes, it's getting loud here now. What... I'm coming. I want to see her again. Yes, but I want to come. I want to come. Stop it, dad. I just said that I want to come. You don't know that! - Great. Thanks. Bye. - Bye. ...the turbines were brought via Russia's annexed Crimea.

Call me if you need anything. - I will. - Anytime, don't worry. - Thank you. - No problem. Tell me, how long... I can't tell you that. Only the love of God knows. If she won't... Hello. Hello, grandma. SMS to Renate. Okay. What you want to tell Renate? Hello mom. I'm at grandma's. I call you... Should I send it to her? No. All good. I won't send it now. Everything is fine grandma. Everything. You can't sleep? No. Don't you want to lay down here? Mhm. I think it's good you didn't take her to a hospital. - Yes, I couldn't do that. - Good. ...not in the best shape. Showing very few variations through the season. And the jump is around 120 meters. Not a good jump. There is nothing close to anything you could call a system or method. I find it sad. - That's not my kind of sport. - What about tennis? That's something different. The German team is really strong. - Hello! - Lilo. Hi. You two know how to enjoy life. ...he can do it very well right now, great Jump competition... Hi, nice that you came. Hey Annie, are the guys taking care of you? Turn the volume down a bit, guys. What you have there? - She can understand. - We don't know that. I'm telling you. Annie understands everything. She reacts. Wanna listen to some music, Annie? Classical? What a jump! Should we listen to classical radio? Grandma always likes it. Or a CD. Look here, Mozart. - How do you open it? - Here. Here in the front, and then you just... Can't you let her die in peace? - Not so loud. - Yes. - What is it called again? Borschtsch... - No, Borsch. Without "tsch". - Ah ok. I always thought... - And without meat. One doesn't even notice, right? The interview with Merkel, she really did that one well. That one... hmm... What is her name again? From the Daily News, the... Turkish woman. - From Turkish background. - Yes. - Did you work with her? - That's ARD. Ah, ok. But have you ever filmed Merkel? Not a good question? Ok, but maybe he could try something else. Do you know, Dad, if you like that I film the Chancellor or the mayor from Vlotho... The mayor from Vlotho is really a good man. - Oh, really? - Yes. I'm gonna leave you guys. I have to get ready. - Lilo is part of the local council. - Bye. Bye. Do you know that Lilo... Lilo is really good for me. I mean, your mom is a great woman. Not a question, but... ...I just need someone who loves me. Your mom and I, we haven't slept with each other for five years. And with Lilo is every night? Oh, I don't need to know that. Yes. Sorry. But I really want to see how it's gonna be when you'll have kids. Not happening. Oh... Cosmo, hey! We are friends. Good. Cosmo, it's me. Hey! He doesn't know me anymore. - Ah, Armin, hi. - Yes, hey.

To the side? - Yes. - Good. Ah, ok... Mhm. Yes, hold on. Close slowly. Slowly. Dad? Look at this. I think she was wearing this at the family party. But I prefer the one with the flowers, though. I've never seen this one. So we take this one. - Ok, good. - The flowers? Yes. Is it really fine if I leave you alone in a bit? Yes, sure. I'm gonna call Lilo. Tell her to come home. - You already wasted a lot of time. - It's not about that. - I just don't want to leave mom waiting. - Yes, I also don't want it. Ah, I'm gonna stay, ok? No, go now. Mom? Mom? In the beautiful month of May, when all flowers open, love also blossomed in my heart, in the beautiful month of May When all birds sing... Shit. Hello? Hello! What is going on... Dad! Dad! Dad! Hey... Lothar! Come here. That's good, come here. What's going on? Are you afraid? No, come here. - Let's go. Come. - Like that, let's go. What is wrong? Come! Hey, let's go. Cosmo! Ah... shit. Like this. - Where have you been? Like this. Don't you want to come? Come. Come. Come out, let's go. Yes, like this. Come. That's it. Now you come. Come. See you later. Great. Stop! Okay.
