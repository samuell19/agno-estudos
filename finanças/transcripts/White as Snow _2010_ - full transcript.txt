Who can say, "I'm never on my guard. "I stroll through life "unafraid of being ruined, "even by my loved ones, "especially by my loved ones." Who can live without that fear? WHITE AS SNOW Before I lay dying in the snow, I had everything a man could want. Michèle? It's me. I know it's your day off but Milan's semi has arrived. And I'd like to hang on to the Daimler. Suit yourself. If you move the cars around for the Christmas display, tell Romuald to put them all back afterwards, exactly as they were. Same place, facing the same way. - Exactly the same. - No problem. Noémie wants a word about the Christmas tree. Mr. Bojastan? I was only a car dealer but I was the Man. In my field, I was the best. My bank account was flush. I could have hung around in night clubs or played golf with the local toffs. To crown it all, I had love. My family relied on me and I felt good about it. Michèle? Have you seen my Blancpain? Who helped me get all this? Nobody. Nothing and nobody. The extra-slim one? I keep losing it. I made the right choices at the right times. Horacio, would you like a yogurt? Yes, thank you. Sofia will take you to your dance class. - I know. - Done your practice? That's rubbish! What's up? Is it Mum? No, we just want a chat. OK, get in. It's about my plans to expand the kennels. On my plot of land. Right, the land. - What? - Can't he sit on the floor? - No room. - Don't let him lick the windows. The plot's worth a bundle, I know. A big bundle! If I could have it now... I could keep more dogs, upgrade the kennels. I could pay Abel, help him out of his hole. I'm sick of scrimping! - I want to break out. - Break out? Yes, sort of. Remember your Peruvian restaurant idea? "Latino is big this year." I lost a fortune. This is different, I promise. Way different! Here's my loan application. What does the bank say? They say I have a record. You're insolvent. Simple as that. I'm afraid I may agree with them. It's not a good idea. Why not? You're not even scraping by! That's what I keep telling you! We need to grow! We need... What does Dr. Dog think? I'm with Greg. We need to grow. Try growing up, Abel. Get your ass in gear. Life goes by before you know it. I know. I run too slow. You love putting us down! Remind me, Greg. Where were you while I built up my business? Was I lying in the sun? Was I swilling rum with a whore on each arm? While you pissed around, I was learning. Pardon me, but I know about business. Amen. Trust me, Greg. Where do I drop you? Right there. - Here? - Right there. For Mum's present, if you need it. See you Sunday. The prick! Don't let me get my hands on him. Look at you! Like you just got out of bed. 300 euros. 100 for Mum, the rest for us? - I can take fifty of these. - It's very spacious. Welcome to the 87th Brussels Car Fair. I give you our Chairman, Herr Vermeulen. As we all know, times are tough for the car business. We had to work very hard to achieve our sales figures. Thank you... Thank you very much and enjoy the party. Want to add something? Thank you very much. Come for a photo in front of the new 300C. Here is our ace's queen! A jewel to brighten the gloom of any lonely man. I've been watching you, Mr. Chairman. You may be alone but you're not gloomy. Where did you learn German? Before your ace kidnapped me, I was a translator. A pretty good one, too. Congratulations! Shall we have dinner? In a moment. Happy, ace? Proud. Everybody loves you. What did he say? Bullshit. He says I'm a jewel. He's right. Come on. No, you come. Dance with me. I've had too much champagne. Does it show? We really should go. Make my excuses for the appetizer. Are you cross? Do I look it? Where's your partner? We're hungry! Simon? Coming. Where's the chick? You run her over? Good one! Come on, this is our moment. Arly! You're wanted. Arly! He's got his camera out again. Don't bullshit us! Granny's cake! Granny's cake! Happy birthday, Mum! Fabulous! A two-week luxury vacation. Michèle chose Tuscany. Lovely! Thank you, Michèle. - From Greg and I. - Thank you, dears. This one's my favourite. I can picture us perfectly! Me in my suit, carrying buckets, you in high heels at the well. - You don't know your wife. - The point is, I do! Look, it's Simon. Let him in. I'll let him in. How are the dogs? They're fine. - Sorry to barge in. - Don't stand there. Come and sit down. It's Nicole's birthday. Happy birthday. How many candles? 51, 52? 53! Sit down. Won't you have some cake? Grégoire, give Simon some cake. I thought I'd find Maxime on the TV couch. As if! Guess who's going on holiday? Deserting me for how long? - A couple of weeks. - Where to? I need to get my head straight. Skiing, maybe. Take time out. I can't chain him down. He would if he could! I have the keys. So, what's new? Let him eat his cake. You're awful! I'm leaving tonight. I won't be in tomorrow. I've briefed Stéphane and left the current files in order. Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same to me. Get some rest. Try to sleep alone sometimes! - More rain! - Take this. No need. OK if I hang on to the Daimler? No problem. Do you believe he fell asleep? Edgy as he was? They say the airbag was punctured. Did you hear? The lawyer says I should sue. Sue who? Us? That's what I told him. Would you mind coming to Simon's house? You don't mind? See you soon. We're making a quick detour. What's all this? I'll see what's up. What's going on? Their car broke down. It's not out of fuel. It starts OK. Then, nothing. I'll give it a look. You are mechanic? No, I run a local dealership. Glad to meet you. Maxime Bojastan. Delighted. It's not one of our cars. Camille! Don't be a nuisance. Leave her alone! Take her to the car. Camille, come on now. Come on! I'm going. Don't be too long. Goodbye, Madame. Thank you! Don't you ever listen? This car did not come from you. Correct. But we have many more cars with many problems. And they... They came from you. I don't see. You don't see? Tomorrow we will be at your office before it opens. We're closed for mourning, remember? Be there. Your partner should have fixed our problems. Now you will. Now? Who are you, anyway? Why were you at the funeral? Timo! We're off. What's going on? Why are you here? Why did you stop my wife? You better be there tomorrow, 8 a.m. Look at all this mess. What do I do with him? Why did he always insist on living alone? Do you know? He went on about independence, freedom, the boredom of routine. Boredom of routine, at our age! Sometimes he seemed... cut off. As if he couldn't be a whole person. When we went to Sicily, everything was beautiful. The weather was fine... But he kept on... snapping and shouting at me. Everything I did was wrong. It won't make any sense to you. You always saw him as... the perfect man. Kind, humorous... - But with women... - I need a drink. He could be awful. Bedding all those sluts! I resented loving him. Don't we always, a little? Don't we, Maxime? - Are you all right? - Yes. Stéphane? Maxime here. I can't find Simon's current business folder and his client list... OK! Got it. Very sad, yes. There were some friendly but unfamiliar faces at the funeral. Not you? I haven't had the pleasure, Mr. Mladic, but I thought perhaps you... Where are you? On the sofa in the office. Why? I don't know. If you prefer it, fine. Is Camille OK? Yes. She's spending the night at your mother's. So you're alone? Sophia's here, tidying up. She's big on tidying. Don't drink too much. Call if you need me, OK? Sure. Come home. You're back. Come to bed. Coming. This is Maxime Bojastan. You found your phone? What do you want? Mr. Bojastan, I want things fixed. Arly has gone. Now you pay. I owe you nothing. Forget that idea. I don't know what you did with Simon or what Simon did with you. I know nothing at all! Is that clear? It's none of my business. I'm not involved. Understood? Then I'll explain. You and Arly sold bad cars. You must refund us, and more. You owe 900,000 euros... You're insane! No, you are. And you will pay. Did you kill Simon? Nobody kills a debtor. I'll tell the police. Tell them what? That you robbed me? I'll come and see you one last time. Tell it to the police! - Found your way? - I remembered it. How many guys? Four. I saw four. Four's not many. They're taking advantage of Simon's death. Call the cops. They say Simon owed them repairs... A batch of faulty cars... I don't get it. They want me to cough up instead. If Simon was crooked, it all falls on me. We were partners, jointly responsible. If the cops stick their noses in, I'll lose everything. All my money... Michèle... I can't! Michèle's the kind of woman... She cares a lot about... lifestyle. I can't call the cops. Well, I guess... Tell them there's a snag, things aren't that simple. No, we have to negotiate. Stand up to them. How tough are they? They brought a gun to the showroom. I need your help. Both of you. If you refuse, I'll understand. Think it over. Are you there? You're such a prick! Soon as you're in trouble... Stop right there! This time, it's not a handout. We join forces. Make a deal. I give you the land, you give me a hand. Nobody's bribing or pampering anyone. - You think so? - Exactly. This makes it a whole new deal. See? Think about it. I'll call you later. You've changed your mind? What makes it a new deal? All that's happened makes me think... Simon's accident shook me up. Unload the rest and send it back. Good morning. Excuse me. Greg Lemarchand, Head of Sales. Can I help you? I'm here to see Mr. Bojastan. We're expecting you. I'll get him. You're the visitor? From where exactly? Finland. Finland! That's nice. And far! You'll be eager to get home. We get Finnish yogurt here. This is German. Mercedes 200 roadster. The media call it the heir to the Silver Arrow. A pretty little ladies' sports car. Can I try it? No problem. Will you bear with me? He wants to try the roadster. Does Max know you're taking it out? Max always knows everything. - What are you doing? - Leave it to us. I don't need this kind of help! Ventilated seats. Beautiful leather. Feel the quality under your ass? RDS stereo. Pure sound. Hear that? You like it? Enjoy the leather, pal, before we whip your ass. Explain why you're here, then fuck off back to Finlandia. Throw it in the back. Get out. Tell your boss to call me. I'm keeping this on account. We'll talk about the rest. Get out! I'm on their tail. Settle down! Just driving. Nice and easy. I'm standing by, just in case. Stop yelling at me. Got to hang up. Cops. He pulled a huge gun on me! Holy shit! - What now? - Give me a kleenex. He got my gun. He did? What do I do? He's there, the fucker! Drive! Keep driving! He's alone. We do this my way. No fuckups, OK? Stay here and wait. Don't move till I call you. It was him! Help me! Come here! Shit, shit, shit! Why did you mess with us? Why? For God's sake, why? Calm down! Shit! I don't believe it! Tell me it's not true. What made you do it? - Self-defence. - Defence? - You attacked him! - He started it. - It was him or me. - Look what he had! Put it away! Get in the station wagon. He needs treatment. What do we do? His phone keeps ringing! What do we do? We hide him. We take him to the kennels for now. He said he was keeping the Merc on account. Account of what, shithead? It's ringing. Matti? Who's there? Go on ahead. I'll join you as soon as I can. Take the Merc and clean it up! Go on! We're closing. Tell the guys to set the alarms. Go home, all of you. Two days before Christmas? Yes! Two days before Christmas. That's right. I've got family troubles, see? I'll phone them individually tomorrow, OK? So? How is he? He's stable. Does he speak? He's zonked. He mumbles in Finnish. He's lost his French. I dug out the bullets. I'll see him. He's in the back bedroom. - What's that? - All we have. We use it on dogs. Strong stuff. Can't you do anything right? I'm really sorry. You keep digging me into deeper shit. One fuckup after another! Don't say you're not part of this! You're no innocent bystander! Did I shoot holes in that guy? You think this all started in the parking lot? Did I tell you to ride off in the Merc? Fuck you, Grégoire! And you! Fuck the two of you! I'm sick of you both! Don't talk to me like that! You neither! Go on, fuck off! Watch it! Don't push us over the edge! I think they killed Simon. Oh, boy! How do you know? Did the guy upstairs tell you? Not in his condition. I can feel it. You knew. You knew it before we met in the bar. I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I found some skin in Simon's house. Maybe it's nothing. I could be imagining things. I'm stupid! Stupid! What else could I do? If Simon's dirt comes out, everything explodes! You, me, the dealership, the kennels! We all go down together! For God's sake! You were only supposed to counterbalance... Counterbalance what? A gang of killers! We don't know for sure! They held an inquest. Nobody found anything. The medics, the cops, the coroner. Nobody! That bit of skin... Maybe it came from his bloody pig. What the hell do I know? Can you imagine, if I get jailed again because of this? Think of that! You poison my blood. Let me sort it out. God knows how, but I will. We leave out the cops but if I end up in jail again, I'll blame only you. I understand. I've got to go. I've come to take you both to a hotel. Remember Posery? You met him at Sénéquier's. Good customer, very nice guy, high up in EDF. He phoned me today, very kindly, to say there's going to be a giant power cut. The whole area, for hours. Freeze our tits off! I know it seems... But it's a freak event. A big problem with the dam. It has to be shut down. Save it. Noémie called. What's going on? What do you mean? She said you shut the showroom and put guards on it. Don't tell me nothing's going on. Listen, Michèle. Those men we saw after the funeral, they're hassling me. I think it's a protection racket. Call the police. What for? One guy nosing around the shop? I'm just being careful. Noémie saw blood on Abel. He fought with the guy, that's why. She's such a fusspot! The guy ran off. I'm calling them, if you don't. Wait! Listen! Just for one second. I will, later. I'll go to the cops if it's really necessary. First I need to wait a little longer. It can't be that bad. Why drag us out at midnight, then? Look at me! Who do you see in front of you? You're crazy! What have you done? It's not us, it's them. They're after you! This Matti person disappeared and they're blaming you. Get it? They're threatening us! They're coming for us! Wait. We'll go to a hotel. Camille! Wake up, darling. Put your little coat on. You're staying with us. I can't. I've got to get this sorted. I'm staying with you! I'm not going anywhere alone. Come on, sweetheart. I'll finish packing. Abel? It's us. We're coming over with Camille. I think it's best. We'll make the beds. - Upstairs? - Fine. Hide the parcel. I don't want any surprises. Right. Got that? Hide the parcel to avoid surprises. Do it. We'll put it in the dog shed. Daddy... Sleep, sweetie. We're going to visit Uncle Greg. - Need a hand? - I can manage. Coffee? Might as well. I'm not sleepy any more. Lie down, darling. I'll kiss you goodnight. I know why Daddy wanted to come here. You do? It's for a surprise. He says Simon drove off with their dough. Bullshit. There was no cash in the car. They did him. If they had what they want, they'd leave us alone. What else does he say? If he dies, you'll still owe them, and more. I had no part in it. Understand? Simon sold you those cars. Only him! Not me! You are the same. Don't act stupid. Look where it's got us! I deal in France, fair and square. You dealt with Simon. He tricked you. He tricked me. He tricked everybody! If I die, you die. Call my friends and give me to them. Then pay for your wrongdoing. I didn't do anything! Stop it! Are you crazy? You heard him. What are you doing? They're mafia! We can't take them on. We're only trying to get out of this. We need to patch him up and talk. That's all. Listen. I've been thinking. That money is somewhere. It didn't fly away. Simon had it but they didn't find it. Our only hope is to find it and give it to them. If he croaks, they'll kill us. We can't cross that line. I'd say we crossed it long ago. If we find the cash, we're safe. Search Simon's house. I'll search the garage. Abel stays here. It's our only hope. Everything OK? Is Camille asleep? You said you'd stay. I will. I'm just making a quick trip to get something crucial. What is it? Guns? Of course not! - I trust you. - You doubt me? No! I just said so. Do you trust me too? Of course. Obviously. What are you getting at? Do you feel I'm with you? You're with me. God knows I need you. Good. We see eye to eye. So what are you up to? I'm trying to get us out of this. That's what. Please don't be like this. Put the light on. Put the light on. Give me water. Give me water! Give. That you, sir? Everything OK? It's me. I won't be long. I'll lock up. See you, then. OK if I hang on to the Daimler? Good God! Greg, just to say it's OK. I've got the... It's me. Where are you? I'm coming. I'll be back as soon as I can. The man, Matti. I... Stop worrying. Everything's under control. I'm about to see Matti. I'm at his hotel now. He's coming down to meet me. Go back to bed. Promise? I'll be back soon. - Why are you whispering? - I'm not! It's late. I'm tired. Settle down, OK? I won't be long. All right. Tomorrow, all this will be over. I'm on my way with Simon's cash. Brilliant! Tell Greg. Where were you? Maxime just phoned. He's on his way. Everything's sorted. I know these guys are rather... We're not sure what they want. It's kind of vague. Did I say something funny? Nice bundle, right? I've got a lot more stashed away. You must have had fun working your secret scams. Secret from who? From me. Behind my back. You always knew I was tricky. You liked me for it. It suited you and I made you laugh. You're dead now. The joke's over. It's sad. I was having a ball. It's not my fault. My conscience is clear. Crystal clear. About time! I couldn't talk! They've ransacked Simon's house! Forget it. Max found the money. Come back! They've gone berserk! They're heading to the kennels! Warn Maxime! Shit! We're leaving. Can't you sleep, honey? Come with me or let me go. I'm taking the station wagon. They'll be right back. Don't touch me! Let us go! Don't be silly! The shit's hit the fan. The Finn's gone. Michèle and Camille too. What do you mean? Who knows? Maybe he's with them. I've just seen him! He's here. I'll fix him. Find Michèle and Camille! I can't! She took my car. I'm stuck here! Help, please! Come back, you jerk! Keep calm, ma'am. Max! Come here! Sit! Go get 'em! When I say, open it! Now! I'll drop you off in town and we're through. I don't need your help. Stop the car! - What now? - Come on! Abel! What is it, Noémie? The showroom's been wrecked! Come quick! The police want to see you! I can't! They'll ask questions I can't answer! I'll come as soon as I can. The idiots! They missed it! The idiots! My God! There! We'll give those clods their money and cool things down. Any word from Michèle? I can't get through to her. How are the dogs? And Abel? Is he back yet? What's up? We have your brother. We're taking him. Call quick if you want to see him again. THE NORTH OF FINLAND THREE DAYS LATER What's this? To keep you warm. Orange was all they had. Relax. There's plenty left. Did you come here to shop or rescue your brother? Don't touch. It's for him, when he comes back. Stick 'em up. That'll bring him back for sure. Pick it up and put it back. Pick it up and put it back. Pick up your shit! Pick it up. They won't come. They're playing with us. Oh yeah? - Don't they want their money? - They want us to suffer. They're enjoying themselves. It's punishment. The money? They don't give a shit. Abel is dead, bro. I'm dead too. And you. Everybody's dead. Hey, big man! Carry your own shit! Girls, in the car! You drive. They beat themselves up for us! Get in. Just do it. Bella, in the other car. You, time for a stroll. Come on. I'm not your brother. Stop staring at her. Stop staring! She's not yours. See? Get down. On the ground. I've been missing you. Relax. Everything's cool. What's going on? Grégoire! Shut up! Drive on. Drive to Martiniemi. Get up! Coat off. Take your coat off! 'Morning. Hi, girls. You little shit. Good to see you again. Want to try, Puma? No. Have a go. Hold it tight. Go on! Quiet! Bojastan! Come back! I've got your brother here! You hear me? He's here! Come back or I'll kill him! Jukku! Markku! Come back here! Bojastan! Abel! Here's how it all ended. I somehow made it back to the town. The local cops came across Abel. He took them to the shootout place. Everyone, dead and alive, had gone. Nothing was left. The cops found Maxime eventually, at death's door but still alive. Back home, I had some explaining to do. I laid all the blame on Simon. Everything was dead for me anyway, in every sense. No complaint had been filed. There was no corpse. The police kept me on the hook, then the dust settled. Thanks, Greg! Give him a kiss! One evening, I came out and said I'd left something back there in the snow. Abel said we all lost something there. To me, it didn't feel like a loss. It felt like I'd had an appointment there in the forest, to lay some part of me down. Something from far away. I phoned Michèle almost every day. Subtitles by Nigel Palmer Subtitling : C.M.C.
