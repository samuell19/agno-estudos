I've got lots of friends, and we love each other, and we take care of each of other. Did you get the card I sent you from Chicago? Yeah. You know what we did after that? We saw Miracle Canyon. It was really fantastic. No, Daddy. Don't send me any money. Daddy, I didn't call you for you to send me money. I have money. I'm even paying for the call. I've got lots of nickels, and dimes, and quarters-- lots of them. Daddy, it's not begging. You don't understand. I just ask people if they have any change they don't need. Mom, Daddy, do you still love me? Because I love you. You don't hate me. I thought you hate me. Mom, don't cry. Please, Mom, don't cry. I will. Well, I-- I can't yet, but I will.

This should keep you busy. There's more if you want it. Oh, I can't eat this much. Try. Aren't you're gonna have any? I'm getting ours now. Well, why don't you try to reset the meeting for tomorrow? Well, we woke up this morning and found Denise was home. Of course we were relieved. No, No, don't tell 'em that. Tell 'em I had car trouble. OK. Daddy, you don't have to stay home. You just eat your toast before it gets cold. There you go. Thank you. Well. Is that all you're having? Oh. Well, we're on diets. Oh. Wow. You look like you've lost 20 pounds. No. I don't think I lost that much. SUSIE: Well, you sure look great. Thanks. You sure filled out. Yeah, I guess so. Well, I tell you one thing. I sure feel stuffed in this bra. [phone ringing] See, you've got the right idea. I mean, who needs it? -Don't start that again. -I'm not. [phone ringing] DAD: Hello? Her idea of being attractive is to go around, bouncing up and down like a cow. That's not my idea of being attractive. Hey, ladies, please! What time is his plane? All right, all right. 20 minutes. Bye. I gotta go to the office. Oh, Ed. That's OK. Boy, oh, boy. They were so worried about what to do when you came home. They actually went to a psychiatrist to find out how to act. But business comes before everything else, doesn't it, Daddy? All right, all right. Fine. What's gotten into you? Ed, take her to school now. Bye, Dennie. I'm not done eating. DAD: Come on, come on! Well, is it OK if I get my books? MOM: Don't be fresh! Susie. SUSIE: Thank you. I'll try to be home early, baby. I must say, she's gotten to be as much trouble as you were. Oh, that's a fine thing for me to say right after you get home, isn't it? Well, that's OK. I was a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. Must've been terrible for you. I'm not sick, or pregnant, or anything. Thank heavens. Mom, I'm sorry. I-- I didn't mean to hurt you and Daddy so much. I really am sorry. I love you. Frankly, I-- I don't think we could go through it again. Mom, can-- can I stay? I promise you, I'll try and make up for everything. I promise. I love you. Oh, my baby. My baby! Of course you can stay! We love you too. [chanting] Where'd she go, man? When did she leave? I don't know, man. I dunno. Well, was she all right? No. No, she was bad, man. She was bad after you left. It was sad. MOM: Are you sure you're all right? Yeah! MOM: Well, I want you to see the doctor anyway, but that can wait a while. You know what I'd like? What? MOM: For you to get out of those filthy clothes and clean yourself up. Oh, OK. MOM: Frankly, honey, you are a sight! You'd better take that little goodie. MOM: Where are the clothes you came home in? I put 'em in the dirty clothes hamper. MOM: Dennie, these are unsalvageable. I'm-- I'm gonna throw them away. MAN [VOICEOVER]: Don't worry. Don't worry. Got to live, got to get dirty. Don't care. [inaudible] MAN [VOICEOVER]: It's a soap-sud society out there that thinks it can clean itself in a washing machine. Bleach their lives like their bleach their clothes until they're colorless, odorless, meaningless. Forget them. That's it. That's it. Ah. Beautiful. Welcome home. Hey, get back here with that truck! Get back here with my truck! Get back here, you bum! I don't understand the world anymore. I mean, I used to understand the world, but I don't anymore. I can't understand a world where people just come up and they steal exterminator trucks. I-- I don't understand it. I'm going home. I'm going home. [siren wails] Mom? Mom? Mother? GIRL [VOICEOVER]: Mommy, why don't you and Daddy stay together anymore at night? WOMAN [VOICEOVER]: We do, baby.

DENISE [VOICEOVER]: We'll always be together, won't we? You'll always take care of me. [humming] Dennie? Dennie? Hey. Good grief. What did you do to your hair? I cut it. You sure did. Wow. Are you high? No. Come on. Are you? No. Well, you sure are someplace else. You didn't even hear me when I came in. Is school out? Yes, thank goodness. Why'd you cut your hair? I dunno. I just felt like it. Well, it looks just like it did before. So what? I liked it better long. Well, I like it better this way. What happened? I mean, I thought everything was so great, you know, you going everywhere, and you had friends, and a-- a guy you really dug. I don't wanna talk about it. It just wasn't that great. That's all. Well, man, it had to be better than what you can get here. Mommy, get pick me up. This one's still my favorite. Yeah, that's the one you used to hit me with. -I did not. -You did so! Oh, you lie. I do not. Mommy. [crying] You know what? I missed you. Hey, Dennie. MOM: Susan, are you home? Why don't you get out of here? Why don't you both get out of here and let me alone? If I had anything, do you think I'd be stupid enough to keep it in here, the way you go through my stuff all the time? We do no such thing! You do! Can you sit there and tell me that this is the first time you've gone through my room? Just go ahead and tell me, and give me that! Denise! You watch how you talk to your mother. If we could trust you, we wouldn't have to do this. If we could trust you, we wouldn't have to do this! SUSIE: When did you ever try to trust me? Didn't we ask you, beg you to tell us if you or your friends got involved with drugs before something terrible happened? And didn't you say you weren't? I did, yes! Yes, you did, and that was a lie! Don't lie to us! Now, you tell us the truth! Denise, please, tell us the truth. Did you bring-- --Boys into this house? Drugs into this house? Never before. No, not ever! If you ever want our trust again-- --Then, you're gonna have to earn it by telling us the truth! I am! I am! You see what you came back to? Why don't you go search her room? She must have brought a supply back with her! There's no other way she could stay in this stupid house! You get back in here! And, Dennie, go to your room, or downstairs, or someplace! This doesn't concern you! Well, what happened Judy Howard and a boy were arrested this afternoon! They thought they were taking methadine. Methadrine? Yeah, that's what they called it! Susie, was it really meth? Yes, they found some on them. OH, Susie. Dennie? Dennie? Dennie? You can't handle meth. Flack! Flack! Oh, Susie, please. I don't take methadrine. I don't take anything! I wish I did. I'd take enough right now to blow my head off. All right! I have had just about enough of this! Get out! Dennie, Dennie, go in your room. [interposing voices] Just go in your room now. -Stop it! Stop it. Can't you see? You're treating her just like you treated me! Dennie! SUSIE: You don't love me! MOM: Susie, that's ridiculous. I'm your mother. Dennie, stop this, and tell me. Have you any idea where she might hide drugs in this house. Dennie? Dennie, answer me. Answer me! I can't. Dennie, I will not have you taking sides with your sister against us, not so long as you wanna remain in this house! Oh please, please, Daddy. Please. Let me stay. Please. I promise I'm not taking sides. I promise. Please, let me stay! OK, OK, dear. All right now. Sit down. Now, sit. Calm down. Calm down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Baby. Hey, I like what you've done with your hair. It's like it was when I was little. There it is. No, no, no, no. I didn't see the driver. We'll looking everywhere for him. Look, please, get that truck outta here. You don't know what an exterminator truck parked in front of a restaurant can do to me! Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. No. What's the problem, sir? I refuse to pay for food cooked in a restaurant that has bugs in it. Bugs? In all my years, in all my years, I've never had a bug. I can swear to it! Honest, I've never had a bug! Listen, I've never had a bug in my-- you dirty hippy, I've never had a bug! Well, maybe you can get by on love in this world, but I never saw the day when love would put steaks like this on the table. When's the last time you had a steak, baby? --I don't know. I can't remember. How did you get by? How did you get money? You couldn't always get enough by begging? Well, sometimes, the guys'd work. Work? DENISE: Yeah, every once in a while. MOM: What about the other times? That's a [inaudible] That's great. Now, come on. Just take it, and eat it. Your sister thinks you lived some great, free life out there. Well, Sue, what do you think? Think you'd rather eat someone else's garbage than steaks like these? Here we go. DAD: Dennie. What? DAD: What's the matter? Oh, nothing. I'm just a little tired. I'm not surprised. It's a wonder you've got any health left at all. You're gonna see the doctor tomorrow. Well, may I be excused now? I think I'll go lay down. Of course. You got a headache? Just a little one. MOM: Take a couple of aspirin. OK. I suppose you'll still think your sister's rebellion was some kind of exciting adventure. Oh, Susie. [shouting] Hey, hey, gimme those! Gimme, gimme! Hey, you! Come here! Come here, gimme that! Gimme those. Hey, come here. Gimme 'em! Look up. OK. Straight ahead. Look straight ahead. Yeah. Now look up again. That's it. Good. OK. Just relax. [phone ringing] All right. Breathe in. That's it. Again. Again. Boy, I can't here you. OK. That's good. You can get dressed now. Marijuana? Yeah. DOCTOR: OK. LSD? Yeah. DOCTOR: Anything else? Hmm, mescaline, speed, stuff like that. Be beautiful, baby. DOCTOR: You on anything now? No. Can't you tell? I just wanted to be sure. When was the last time you used anything? I dunno. Not for about a week, since before I went home, and I was on the road and everything. OK. [phone ringing] Did you have any trouble with VD? No. That's good. You were lucky. Did you use any contraceptives? Yeah. What kind? I dunno. They were little pink things. Oh. Where'd you get 'em? Off the street. Some girl gave 'em to me. DOCTOR: You have any left? Why? Well, street pills are usually contaminated. And if they're not, they're not the right compound for you. So if I know what you were using, I can, you know, watch out for any side effects that might develop. Well, I don't have any left. OK. Think you'll be needing anymore? What do you do? Ask every girl that comes in here if she wants pills? No. Well, you asked me. Look, don't make a big deal out of a simple question, huh? If I said, yes, would you give them to me without telling my parents? Well, what did you do? Already talk to them? Well, I discussed it with your mother. She called you? Mhm. Oh, wow. I guess that shows you what she thinks about me. She doesn't think anything. She's just concerned about you. That's all. Yeah, she left the final decision up to us. Well, she could have talked to me without using you. Is there anything else she's concerned about? Anything else she wants to know about me? Um, I'd say you could use a little weight. But you're very healthy, and you're a very pretty girl. And it seems like you're a little nervous about being back home. [MUSIC - LINDA RONSTADT, "DIFFERENT DAY"] OK OK [ice cream truck music plays] I think I may know what's in the food. Help yourself. There goes my diet. Golly. Are you a married woman? 'Cause if you're not, those pajamas you're wearing are an invitation, and I-- I accept. Larry, what would your wife think? After that movie we saw last night, I should not only approve, I should join you. Oh, I just don't believe some of those movies these days! Now, honey, let's try it. Larry! There you go. Eddie, I gotta hand it to you. You know, with what you've been through with those girls, I mean-- Oh, let's forget about the kids, and relax and enjoy ourselves for a little bit. Hey, Arnold, another little rum in that glass? No, not me, but I think May needs it. Are you kidding? I had two before I left the house! She needs it! Listen, I need one here. Denise. Oh, honey, come on down, and help me serve. Everybody's dying to see you. Here. Put this on. It looks cute on you. Hurry. Sue? Sue? Oh, hurry up, darling. You look very pretty.

Eddie, any-- any-- You know, we've had to cancel our trip three times? You know, I wanna see Europe, but I don't wanna go over there and get involved in something you know? You know, you're gonna laugh, but I've heard so much about it. You know where I'd like to go? -No, where? Vietnam. Vi-- oh, that's awful. No, I really mean it. I think it would be a tremendously interesting and educational experience. You always were an intellectual. Denise! Darling. So good to see you! Oh, Denise, baby, come here. Oh, I'm so glad you're back. And we're glad you're all right. Will you look at the figure on this girl? Oh, with a shape like yours, you don't settle for anybody but a rich boy. You promise? Well, I can't promise. Oh, now there's a smart girl! Hold it, everybody. Hold it. Wait till you see the rest of the Miller family. Oh my goodness. Well, what do you call that? It's a dress. Ed, why don't you buy the kid some clothes? Sue, baby. Hello. That tickles. That's enough, darling. Where'd you get that? Off a dead hippie. I just can't get over how these kids are growing up. Well, would you like anything from the kitchen? Look at my Renaissance witch tonight! Sue, I told you to get rid of that terrible dress. Go on upstairs and take it off right now. What's the matter, Mommy? Aren't I pretty anymore? Don't you think I'm pretty? Hope somebody's been at the bar tonight. Oh, Arnie, leave that kid alone, will you? Listen, angel. Pick up on those 9 and a 1/4. AAA's is out of his mind. Hello. Hello. Would you like one of these? Oh, I guess I might as well. You wanna know something? What? I don't think you kids are all on a search for something better. I mean, how many of these parties can you go to twice a month on a rotating date. Would you like some chicken, shrimp, something? How about a little glass for you? Hey, would you believe your daughter'd be helping out like that a year ago. You're being a good girl, honey. We need some more shrimp. It's in the ice box.

Do you wanna be part of my private party? No. Well, I have a little giddy here. Isn't that cute? Susie, have you ever seen a downer freak? Mhm. Me. No, I mean a real downer freak. No. I have. Well, I guess that makes you better than me in every way, right? No. Why don't you stop criticizing me? I'm not. I'm not. I'm just scared for you. Well, you'd better be scared for yourself.

They're on the house! Oh, Sue! What were you gonna do? Say? Come on. Will you stop it and let me talk?

I was just so mad at you for coming home again that I didn't realize that-- that something awful must have happened to make you do it. Do what? Why didn't you tell me how much he hurt you? I mean, the awful way I acted and everything. I would have understood if you'd just told me. Dennie, hurry. He's waiting. Flack? Flack? What happened to your hair? I cut it off. What are you doing here? Came to see how you were doing. You came all the way across the country to see how I'm doing? Sure. Hey. I'm sorry I took off like that. Well, that's OK. I understand.

He's come to get her. Oh no. Well, I'm going out back. DAD: Claire, no, no. Well, do you want them to be gone before we even get out there? Calm down! A hysterical scene isn't gonna keep her at home. I can't lose her twice. You're not going to lose her if you just calm down. She loves him. Don't you understand that-- Shh. Then we can decide what to do. Daddy, don't you want her to be happy. Shut up, shut up, shut up. -Daddy, it's her life. -Shh! Stay out of it! Uh, Dad, Mom, this is Flack. I know who he is. Hi. Hi. Well, sit down. Sit down. Everybody, sit down.

SUSIE: Dennie, you can do it. He came all the way here 'cause he loves you. MOM: Quiet. That's enough. I dunno. Dennie, what's the matter with you, Dennie? DAD: Sue, now, just get in the house Get in the house. That's an order! Right, that's an order. DAD: This doesn't concern you! This-- this isn't necessary. I mean, every-- every problem has some kind of an answer. Sit down. Sit down, please. There must be some compromise we can work out here. Even in business, huh, a man has away. Dennie, is this what you want? She doesn't know what she wants. Why can't you understand that? Dennie, don't-- don't settle for this. It's not enough. -Enough? Enough of what?
