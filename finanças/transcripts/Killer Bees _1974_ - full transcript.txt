(CAR HORN SOUNDING FROM IMPATIENT DRIVER) Out of town salesman: Fill her up with premium, Sonny. ...and take a look at the oil... Gas attendant: Sure. ...and check the tires! Gas attendant: Sure?! Hey, is that Saint Helena?! No, that's Van Bohlen! (SIGN: NO TRESPASSING Van Bohlen Winery) A vineyard! Hey! Where are all the grapes?! You missed them! Next performance starts in June! Hey! Hey mister! You don't want to go in there! Hey! That is Van Bohlen property! It's private! I just want to go in, look around, and see what I missed! What's a bee doing out here this time of year? ah heh (HEAVY BREATHING) ahhheh (SCREAMING) Got you! Hey! I told him. I told him not to fool. (SIRENS SOUNDING) Sergeant Jeffreys: Okay folks... Sergeant Jeffreys: Okay folks, make way for the ambulance stretcher... Sergeant Jeffreys: Back up folks... Sergeant Jeffreys: Hey Mack... bring her up, bring it up closer... I have never seen nothing like the way that guy ploughed into that car. Aah, back in prohibition days, Maysville, Oklahoma... I've seen a milk truck, loaded by a bootlegger of course, run headon into a coach. What happened? We ate barbecued beef for three days. ahahahahaa (LAUGHING) It was all hangover for the next two weeks. Sergeant Jeffreys: Break it up folks. Come on folks, all beat it. Sergeant Jeffreys: Allright, everybody. Make way for the ambulance stretcher(truck). Well! Van Bohlen, California. Tell me... Did your family buy it or do they rent? The Van Bohlen's never rent anything. My... my grandparents planted vineyards along all these hills... ...and the town sort of grew up after. Well, it looks just the way you told me it would. Does it seem the same? Uh heh (LAUGHING), it will never change. The family sees to that. Change isn't their way. Did you see it happen? Sure, I'd seen it happen. And you know as well as I do... it was them... Mr. Van Bohlen... What, I didn't... We ain't seen you fo... For a long time, Zeb... It's almost four years. Yeah. Eh, can we have a couple of cups of coffee? Sure thing... coming right up. You never did that to anybody, before. Look who has come home, folks! It's Mr Edward! (WHISPERING) Young King heir returns home, whom all the serfs love. Would you lay off? Oh come on sweetheart. Really, I think it's nice. It's nice to be known, and it is nice to be remembered... ..and these people seem to really like you. It's not that way, Tory. Sure, it is. This is your town. Look, I never had a town named after me. I never really had a town. (LAUGHING) My dad was in the air force, and most of the places that we lived, were named after... retired congressmen and generals. Here we are... ah heheh (LAUGHING) Anything else, folks? Not a thing. Ah heh... Well, well...eh heheh.. ehrm hmhmm... That's why it is so important to me to meet your family. I know, Tory. Look, you think you are going to meet a nice American family. Frozen dinners, Wednesday night bowling, get out the vote, and back the police. But I told you, it's not that way. Edward, I know what you told me. I still want to meet them for myself. And they'll like me. (Be)cause I'll make them like me. Look, grandmother is still European. They like to keep to themselves. They don't like to entertain strangers. I mean they have their own ways. They are people. No, they are Van Bohlen's. Sergeant Jeffreys: Give me a cup. Sergeant Jeffreys: Better make it two. Sergeant Jeffreys: Listen Tucker, did you notice anything unusual before that guy smashed up? Zeb Tucker: Sarge, I ain't seen nothing unusual (for) twelve to thirty years. Lineman: You didn't see them bees?! The guy's car was full of them! Lineman: They were all over him! They were eatin(g) him! Edward van Bohlen: Victoria, why don't we get something to eat here, and go back to San Fransisco? Sergeant Jeffreys: What did you see? Victoria Wells: Oh, no. Not after it took me three months to get you this far. Zeb Tucker: Well, I heard a crash... Victoria Wells: Look, I am going to go for a visit. Would you like to come along? Edward van Bohlen: Okay, okay. It's your show. You want to see Van Bohlen? Let's go. Zeb Tucker: ...way back during prohibition. Do you remember prohibition? nahnah, you are too young. You probably don't even remember new deal? Guest: See yah. Zeb Tucker: Yeah... Coming right up! Lineman: Make him tell you about the bees? He saw. He had to. Hey, no children, no pets, no cameras! huh? ...and no prodigal sons. They have been off me ever since I left for law school. No law school? They have their own law. Well, here we are. It's perfect. Almost everything around here looks perfect. Mathias van Bohlen: Turn it around and get it out of here. Fast! Matt, you are in my way. Move it. What are you doing here? This is still my home. Yeah? We didn't know that. Fine. But who is that with you? A friend. You cleared it with Madame? I didn't clear it with anybody. (PIANO MUSIC) Go on in, it's not locked. Not locked? No, if you have gotten this far, you are supposed to be one of us. It's only the rest of the world that is locked up. (PIANO MUSIC) Rudolf van Bohlen: Who are you? May I ask what you are doing here? She is with me, father. Edward! I... We didn't expect you. It was an impulse. An impulse? You return home to your family after four years? I have always felt that your departure was rather impulsive. Edward van Bohlen: Father... Victoria Wells: Edward, ahm... I am Victoria Wells, Mr Van Bohlen...I have... I have been look forward to meeting. You brought a guest. You might say the guest brought me. You know we are not... prepared for guests? Father, I wouldn't even be here without her. Well, then I suppose we should find a place for Miss Wells. How about mother's old room? Yes, that sounds suitable. She was only a guest, too. Wasn't she? If you should need anything, Miss Wells... I am sure Edward... can find it for you. He will be going to Madame to tell about you, now. Madame? That's your grandmother. Yeah...Yeah. We will be meeting her, soon. Come on. Madame Maria von Bohlen: Absolutely! If I listened to your brother... from this I was already invalid. Rudolf van Bohlen: Oh, we add to the proper reserves, Madame. Madame Maria von Bohlen:Ah, rubish. One day... soon, I will be as quiet as you could wish, forever. Not yet, not just yet. hmhm. My boys never grow up, do they? What would happen to me, if they didn't? And you, you Edward? You have had time already to try the world... and its little pleasures... hm Your father tells me you have brought one home. Madame, my guest. Ah, Ja. We have just been speaking of you. Grandmother, permit me to introduce Victoria Wells. I am very pleased to meet you, Mrs Van Bohlen. I am sure. You are from San Fransisco, hm? Oh, at the moment, yes...Ahm Actually, I have lived all over the world... France and Germany... My father was... (MADAME RINGS THE BELL) Roseanna, you may serve in ten minutes. Of course, you will join us for dinner... after you have changed. Ahm, since my boys were small... I have expected them to dress for dinner, properly. A family tradition... You do understand? Oh, yes of course. Ahm, my father always tought me to respect traditions... Even those that are different from my own. Excuse me. Madame Maria von Bohlen:.... last year. Mathias van Bohlen: It was a bad situation, Mom. I had four top accountants and attorneys, personally... Oh, our dinner has already been delayed. Edward, seat your guest there. Good. Nonono. Edward, come sit beside me. Perhaps you can stay a little while, hm? Come come. Dear dear. You are in public, dear. Dr. Helmut van Bohlen: Mother, I am sorry. No one as late as you. There was an accident. Someone we know in the village? Just some fool salesman who picked Van Bohlen to get himself killed in. Meet your brother and his guest, Miss Wells. How do you do? Edward. What a surprise. There was a car wreck when we came into town. Was that the accident? Yes. A crash and then fire. What did he die of? Dr. Helmut van Bohlen: Ah... Third degree burns, and merely compounded by... Rudolf van Bohlen: Stupidity... ...from what I heard. I understand that he almost burned up that used car lot. Father, how did you...? It only happened moments before we came into town. Please, please let us forget about this unfortunate accident. It doesn't involve us, Helmut? Does it? No, Madame. Good. Good, now, then let us enjoy our dinner. Hmm? Eat. Stuff your face. This is a Van Bohlen specialty. Well? Catta Verdera (moment of truth). My father bought his cuttings from the eighth province of South Africa. But he was never satisfied, with the new world products. That is because he was always comparing it to the great sweet wines of his homeland. Und they were incomparable. To my prodigal grandson. And I hope you will include my fianc?, Victoria. Another of your surprises, Edward? A fianc?. Hm... Ah... yes, of course. Our best wishes... your fianc?. It is strangely sweet, as if there were honey. Ough! what do you mean...where am I... Miss Wells!... Forgive me, I wouldn't want you to be harmed. Are you okay? Of course I am alright. The bee didn't sting me. Never heard of bees flying after dark, before, though. It's quite alright. Chuch... We have many many bees here in the vineyard. They came here with all of us from Africa. They understand the grapes, and we understand each other. In our home, we were in a country where living things move in a dance together. You understand? Hm? Ahh. Come sch?ne (beautiful). Oh, sch?ne (beautiful). Wiedersehen (see you). They came to her. Grandmother's bees aren't ordinary... Edward, you must think... You must be tired. Yes. Okay. Good night. Tomorrow, my dear? Yes. Tomorrow. It's what you wanted, isn't it? Come on darling, don't cry. I am not going to cry, of course. Those people couldn't make me cry. They are... I know, they are impossible. Why do they treat me like that, like I was some kind of monster. ? I am not some kind of a monster, am I? Am I? I don't know. Does anything interesting happen to you during a full moon? Well, there is a full moon, tonight. Why don't you stick around and find out? It's against house rules. Oh, I am sorry. I forgot. No tourists. No pets. No men in robes after dark. Yeah, and no strangers, remember? Well, that's one they are going to have to change. They'd better get used to me, cause there is definitely another stranger on the away. Hello. No, you rest. You show me where you want them. No! We are going to plant them together. Yes, Madame. Eeh. No, Go away, go away. Ahh. That's astonishing. I am really astonished. I have grown old on this land. You are not old. Ja, I am. I am menschen (human). Nah. It seems like only a little while since your grandfather and I came here. We always thought to go back home. But, then came the war... ..and later prohibition, and depression, and another war... ...and somewhere, in all that hardship, this... this became our home. Ahh. Hah, it's so pretty. It's almost worth it. It certainly is a beautiful place to live. It is more than a place to live, Miss Wells. It is our life. I'd like to know more about your life. Then come along. Come along. Will Ed come back home with us? Ahh. You know... like science... take a bulb, a dry lifeless looking thing and plant it deep. Wait... and when its time has come, it will flower. It cannot help bringing forth what is in it. Yes, Edward will come back home. But, that girl, she confuses everything. We could make her leave. No no, Edward must make the decision, himself. And he will see that she does not belong. These are beautiful. Are they very old? My grandfather brought the first cask from his vineyard in South Africa, after the Boer war. Edward, perhaps you'd like to get a bottle of the finer reserve for your guest? So, that she might sample the fruits of the Van Bohlen labors. Good idea. It's all so new to me, and I find it fascinating. It is fascinating. You seem interested in learning more about us, Miss Wells. Well, I have lived in so many places. I have learned that if you want to belong, you have to be able to adapt quickly to new ways. And I take it you want to belong? Wherever Edward belongs... I must be nice, adapting so readily. Well, my father was the best navigator the air force ever had. And he taught me how to maneuver strange in places, and what signs to watch out for. Really? How are your signs reading on this trip? Well, so far, around Van Bohlen country, they read no trespassing. Well, I am sure your father also taught you that new territories can be deceiving, sometimes dangerous. Not if you stick to your course. You sound like a young lady that is very sure of herself. Well, I am very sure of Edward. Chenin Blanc, plentiful. Thank you. Mmm. You find it different? Yes, it is. How do you do it? Aah, that's a family secret. Oooh, I could keep a family secret. Does it have anything to do with your grandfather's South African wine cuttings? Aaah, actually it has more to do with Madame's bees. The bees? Oh, well then the bees must fertilize the grapes. Yes, but more important, they collect the honey from the grape flowers. Then the least touch, the very least touch, of honey added to the wine as it ferments, makes it... incomparable Van Bohlen wine. Hmm, now if you will excuse me, I have some very dull paperwork to do. Well, I think a father as a right to expect a little relief, one of these days. Edward, you will be coming home, soon. When? In the spring? Well, law school ends in May. And then? If Miss wells will forgive us, ah, I think we should discuss a little business. Well, of course. Phew, well let's get it over with. What kind of business did you have to discuss? The only business worth discussing, Edward... family business. Eeh my love... mhmhahahah (LAUGHTER) Wiedersehen, wiedersehen (see you) Come. mhmhahahah (LAUGHTER) They like me. mhmhahahah (LAUGHTER) you menschen, ah scho Hah... sch?ne (beautiful), wiedersehen (see you), hah? Puff, huh. Go go go. Go. Go, bye bye. mhmhahahah (LAUGHTER) Oh you, come. Come here. There you are. Are you alright? Of course, I am only demonstrating for our visitors from out of town... ...how harmless our little bees are. Aah Ja sch?ne (beautiful). Come come. Come come. Ja. Hohoh (LAUGHING), Ah, you. Come come. Come come. There you are. Sch?..Sch?.. lala... go home. Hah. Ja... ja Go... go... home. Go. Go. Go. Go Home hmmhm (LAUGHING) Ja. Go. mhmhahahah (LAUGHTER) Ah, there you are. Come, yes, go home. Wiedersehen (see you) Lineman: Look, okay. That is a great show. I know what I saw. Sergeant Jeffreys: Yeah. And what I saw, was a guy in a car getting eaten alive by bees, just like those. Oh, oh, you like me. Well, I like you. I love you. Ja. Ja, Good bye bye. Good bye bye. Ah, have you ever known your bees to swarm anyone, Mrs Van Bohlen? Bees are not carnivorous, Mister Jeffreys. Are they, Victoria? Well, I have always heard they prefer flowers to flesh. Well, thank you very much for your help Mrs Van Bohlen. Of course, Mister Jeffreys. Oh oh. By the way, I must remember to ring up your superior... ...to complement him on your efficiency. The bees stay with us, because of our flowers. Acres and acres and... Wait there. Ah, I am sure Mrs Jeffreys will enjoy these. Sergeant Jeffreys: Hoh, ah, thank you very much, Madame. Madame Maria von Bohlen: Yeah. Come on Roger. Phew.. hahh Madame Maria von Bohlen: (MUMBLING TO HERSELF) Can I get you anything? Ah. Is there a medicine or..? Ja. Come baby, go home. Ja? Go go go go. That's a girl. That's a boy. Ja. There is no medicine... ...ahh, quite like this. Rudolf van Bohlen: You have made plans? Edward van Bohlen: Yeah, of course. And they do not include this place? Your home. Well? No, I guess they don't. And why not? Because, it is not the way I want to live. Fine life. It is for you, if that's what you want? But, it's not for me. The family needs you, Edward. Do you remember the kid ah that came to visit me from the village school? The only kid you ever let on the place... Some child, yes. He... We were playing... and he knocked me over. He didn't mean to hurt me. It was an accident. They were on him in seconds. They thought... That was a long time ago. What about the accident in the village, yesterday? One should think of the future, Edward. That's what I am thinking of, father. My boys, they have always left to me, what does not go into the making of wine. Maybe, if you'd let them do more for you. I m(ean), people need to be free. Ahh, all you youngsters... People are never free. They always serve. If they are weak enough in their spirits, they serve only themselves. If they are strong, they serve the living community of those they love. They take hold of the center. The center of... ...of the hive. No, ah ah ah, ja, ja. of the family. Ja. But there is more to a woman, than family? Ah no. The rest of it is an illusion. A woman without family, has nothing to cry for, nothing to yield to. What good is life to an empty woman, hah? You make woman's life sound awfully hard, and unrelenting. It would seem so only to empty women and hollow men. This life is a wonder. It's our destiny, our heritage. We make life to protect it. We mourn the passing of life, because it is sweet. It is not a cheap holiday. What's all this talk about a holiday? Do you want to get away from it all? Come on, we'll go for a walk. We were speaking of those things most worth having. Like living your own way... with someone you love? You seem to have lost your values? I'd like to go for a walk, now. Values, Madame? What would you call the notion that one can live only for himself? I don't have to answer you. Of course not. Hehehhuhuh (LAUGHING) Of course not. Who must answer to an old woman. Please, Edward, let's go for a walk. Madame, I... Oh, go along, go along, my dear. We will speak again, when you are free. Come on. Why didn't you say what you're thinking? I am not. What? thinking. Well, you better think. Your grandmother will never accept me. Look, forget her, please. Okay, I can, but can you? She really gets to you, doesn't she? She raised me. I mean, you damp down all the feelings of love and resentment and fear, respect, but... But, now you are wondering about us? No, darling. Not like that. It's duty, Tory. It's what she taught us. Things she doesn't see is that... What? My duty is with you, now. I mean, you are my family. Oooh. She'll understand. No, she won't understand. But it doesn't make any difference. I got you. So have I. Why should you have to choose like that? Oh, forget it. That's their way. Edward van Bohlen: When I was little... Lineman: (SCREAMING) Get to town, call for help. Look, I'll do what I can, Okay? Alright. Mister Tucker. Good morning, young lady. What's the matter? Somebody is hurt down the road, I need to call an ambulance. I haven't got any money. Could You? wowo wait a minute. Here you go. Just ask for the State police. They'll send an emergency vehicle. Who was it? What happened? I don't know. A lineman fell. Ah yes, operator, could you give me the State police, please. It's an emergency. Hello, this is Victoria Wells. I am calling from Tucker's Cafe in Van Bohlen. Yes there has been an accident. We need an amb...huh Helmut, Edward is down the road. He needs help. This is Dr. Van Bohlen. I am awfully sorry. There has been a mistake. Yes. Everything is alright, now. Oh, that's okay, thank you. There hasn't been a mistake. The man needs help. Now, whatever it is, we can take care of it. We don't need any help from anyone. Can't you do something? I live here. Well, I don't. How the hell did you find out about?... Your girl friend seemed to think this was a police matter. What's wrong with you, Edward? You want to destroy us? Well, Isn't there something you can do for him? Isn't there something you can give him? He's dead. Now, what happened? He was working on the pole, and he opened the transformer box. and? The bees. Look at him, Edward. There isn't a single mark on him. Look at him. Now, I am going to take him over to my office... ...and make out a death certificate. I think I'll go along with you. There is something we got to talk about. Leave it alone, Edward. Now the bees frightened him, and bees frighten everybody. Edward... ...just leave it alone. Is it still all in the family? The family is everything... ...but you never understood that, did you? Always going your own way. I will always go my way. Away from this... ...partnership with the... The bees belong to us. Are you sure you don't belong to them? Doctor Van Bohlen? Oh, we had a call, a while ago, from down in Tucker's cafe... ...and eh... apparently got cut off... something about an accident. Yes... a lineman, from the phone company, fell. Roger Nossaman? What happened? Ahm... He fell. He was working at a pole, and he fell. Why? Roger was an old hand, he worked poles for ten years. What made him fall? We didn't see him. He just yelled and he fell. We?... You and Doctor Van Bohlen were together? No, no. My girl friend Victoria and I. By the way, what's your name? Edward van Bohlen. You wouldn't have any objection, if I had the coroner take a look at this one, would you? I am the coroner here. Hmhm (LAUGHING) You wouldn't be the mayor and the city attorney, would you? hahaheh... (LAUGHING) You know, that's funny Sergeant, that's real funny... You got a nice sense of humor. Now, if you'd like an examination of your own,... ...you are certainly welcome to it. There is no mystery here. That's a matter of opinion. Medical opinion? Why don't you let me set that examination up for ya, hah? Oh, I'll take care of that, doctor. Well, there doesn't seem to be much else for me to do. So, it seems.. For now. (KNOCKING ON THE DOOR) Yes Madame asks you to join her for lunch. No. Tell her no thank you, I am leaving. Yes, mam. Roseanna? Tell her I will be right down. (PHONE RINGING) Yes. Yes, my dear. What? He... I see. He's dead? And then what? Ooh. Hah, that is reassuring. Isn't it? mhm. Ah. Helmut, I will speak to you, later, hah? Ah. Come, sit. We have some food, hmm. Quick. Thank you. Ooh. (MADAME RINGS THE BELL) Ah... You... You seem troubled. Well, we saw a bad accident down the vineyard. Helmut just phoned. What happened, what did you see? I am not sure? Ah...m... I heard a scream. Edward went to help, and I ran into town to phone. Ja. Then you saw nothing? Only the man... all crushed. Edward should have let someone else see to the man. No, there wasn't anybody else. There is always someone else. Edward must learn. He has been away a long time, Mrs Van Bohlen, and he has learned quite a lot. Hmm... Such as? Such as, that there is no one else. The tea is cold. Yes. I have known my grandson for 25 years. He's headstrong...impulsive...but, in the end, he will do his duty... ...unlike those of his generation. I am sure you are right. And his duty is to race family. It is. We have spoken of it, often. hmm, here. Hmah... Honey, my dear? No. No, thank you. I am supposed to watch my weight. You have a lovely figure. I am sure you are attractive to many men. Perhaps, it would be best for you to return to your San Fransisco suitors? ...And let Edward return to his family. But you see, I am his family. Hohoh (LAUGHTER) Nonsense. Nonsense Edward thought I shouldn't tell you. Tell me what? We've been living together for two years. And I do want you to know before we leave... Know what? ...About the baby. I don't believe you. So, you see... We are his family, now. Aren't we? I won't believe you. Aren't we? I won't believe you. Aren't we? I won't... I won't believe it...ah... Mrs Van Bohlen? Mrs Van Bohlen? Mrs Van Bohlen? Mrs Van Bohlen?! Roseanna! Rudolf, what's keeping him? Right? Why can't he...? Because, he has nothing to tell us, yet, Mathias. Can we get someone?...a specialist? You won't need a specialist. (CRYING) How? How... I'll tell you how... ...By bearing all the pain, all the responsibility of fifty hard years. A specialist... You want specialists, Edward? We had them up here, two years ago. We had four of them here. They did all that specialists can do. I can't believe that, Helmut. After all, with modern medicine?... Modern medicine can't cure seventy hard years, father. It can't cure a heart that simply won't work. Helmut, were there any marks on her? Sure, all the marks of a long life. He means bee stings, Helmut. Bee stings? Only, how could there be? No, that's not true. (Be)cause I saw her. And they were all over her, and they killed her. You must be losing your mind. Bee stings?... ...on Madame? (LAUGHTER) Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory? Pheh. Hah?!... Who is that? Sergeant Jeffreys. Who? Sergeant Jeffreys. I saw you on the porch with Mrs Van Bohlen? You are not a Van Bohlen, are you? No. Not yet. ahm... I am Victoria Wells. These Van Bohlen's, they have a lot of power in this area... ...but, nobody seems very close to them. Well, I wouldn't know. I am only close to one of them. I can't get anything out of anybody. That's why I am out of uniform, and on my own time, and... Miss Wells, you turned in the accident report when Roger Nossaman fell? Yes. What did you see? Well, nothing. Only the man. No bees? Bees? No. No. No bees. The bees, here... They fly at night. Have you noticed? Yes. I have been asking around, and only one kind does that... ...African bees. They look just like honey bees, but there's a difference. They seem to have a single mind, and they kill. Tory! Tory! I'd better go. Tory! (ELATED) Victoria. What are you doing here? I had to get out. Look,... ...everybody is half crazy with grief. I want to leave. Terrific, tomorrow. No. Now. If we don't go now, we are never going to go. I got the funeral. I have to be here. eh... I don't think I can bare it. You don't have to. Look,... ...first thing in the morning... We get ready, you'll get packed... ...and we get in the car. ...start driving to San Fransisco. hehe (LAUGHING) ...no classical music.. ...just rock and roll... ...Ah, you can drive... ...and then we are going to get there. Okay? (CHURCH MUSIC) Out of the strong, came forth sweetness... ...says the book of judges. As Sampson found, when he returned to the lions he'd slain... ...and found there, a swarm of bees, and a cone of honey. So it was with this woman, Maria von Bohlen. She was at once the unity, and beauty of the family, we all love and respect. (CHURCH BELLS RINGING) (BEES HUMMING) As a young woman, she crossed an ocean and a continent, to be among us. She raised her family here. Her son, Rudolf, and her grandsons Mathias, Helmut, and Edward. They came across the world, from a war that had turned their native land into a battleground. They came, seeking peace. A place where things could be grown. And they gave much more to the land, than they took away. Like so many of the rest of us, their memory extended back to a Europe... ...from which their ancestors had come, amidst other ages, other wars... Edward? Edward? (BEES HUMMING) They continued the quest of their forefathers, looking for the great good place... ...and found it here on the edges of the Pacific. They put down roots, the roots of those vines to sustain a whole community. Together they brought forth the sweetness of grapes... (HUMMING BEES) ...and flowers, and made these hills an image of paradise. Look about you, and you will see her work. Stills planted, waiting for the pulse of spring time to burst into flowers. You will see her son and grandsons, each determined to carry on the family tradition... She fought in those hard early years, when first she came to this land... ...but now, her sole journey in this world is done. beyond our imagining... a land of... milk and honey No! No, for God's sake! (ALL YELLING) What's going on?! What are they doing, now?! Edward! Edward! Edward, wait! Officer, would you drive us to the house? Let's go. (SIRENS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (SCREAMING) Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory! Tory! I am here, Edward. Are you alright? Of course. Why wouldn't I be? Are you alright? We are much better for you, being here. There was trouble at the funeral. I am glad you weren't there. Trouble? More like a riot, Miss Wells. A few people were stung by bees, that's all. Well , that's awful. Helmut, can't you do something for the Sergeant? Don't bother. Is everything alright here, Miss Wells? Everything here is as it has always been. These things... could have destroyed the whole town, or worse. Sergeant, bees are everywhere. The flowers at the funeral attracted a number of bees... ...then unfortunately that boy was foolish enough to excite them. You probably wouldn't have been stung at all, if you hadn't run from them. Yea, when you stand still, they let you alone. It's over now, and I am sure it won't happen, again. How can you be sure? It's a feeling I have. If I went before a judge, and told him what I think,... ...and asked for a warrant to search this place,... He'd turn you down. He'd think I was crazy. I hope your feeling is right, Miss Wells. I need a drink. Allow me. We will be leaving right away. Oh, I don't think so, Edward. Your family needs us, now. But our life, and our child? This is a beautiful place to race a child. I am going back to San Fransisco, Victoria. Edward, don't be impulsive... ...again. Edward, please son, join us. Father. To a new Van Bohlen. Your health,... ...and a long life,... ...Madame.
