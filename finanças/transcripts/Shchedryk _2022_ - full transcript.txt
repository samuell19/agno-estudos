They have arrived! Dad! Arrived! Put your coat on. Don't catch cold. Mr. Isaac, why are renting half of the house to the strangers? Joseph stays in New York. It's his decision. It's his part of the house. As always. Think of it, they all came at the same time. Hold on. This is the place. What are you waiting for? Unload the truck. Yes, sir, major. - I'm Yaroslava. - I'm Teresa. - Is this a piano? - It's an upright piano. How to play the upright piano? Must be, the same way as playing the piano. Ms. Sofia! It's so great that you move here. Now we can play the piano and sing every day. I am very glad to meet you too. - Will we live next to Ukrainians? - Looks like that. Teresa, come on. - Be careful with that. - Yes, sir. That's great. Dinah won't have to make it across the city to have music lessons with Ms. Sofia. Is the music teacher's husband also an officer? He is a former serviceman. Now he performs at the restaurant. Maria, are you not supposed to meet the guests? Did you noticed that our new neighbor reacted a bit strange? What do you mean? She seemed to be disappointed. I don't think so. Here, take it. I'm holding. You shouln't worry about her. That's better. She is sleeping. How do you like this place? Tell me did you know that there is an attorney's office on the ground floor? His clients come every day. Don't worry. Why are you concerned about the ground floor? What about the neighbors? Nobody notified us that musicians will live down there. Have you just heard that this lady gives lessons at home? No sound will make it through these walls. Really? I like music but not this false playing and singing. We won't stay here for long. - Couldn't we just... - We couldn't. Isaac. Children have just fell asleep. Can you make it louder? - This is a motanka-doll. - Mothanka? Imagine that you have an egg in your mouth. And all the sounds are hard. Ok? Great. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Come in, join us. Let's try together. Do you remember the warm-up? Excuse me, may I come in? Yes, Maria, come in. One more voice won't come amiss. Thank you. Have you seen Thalia? No, she hasn't come here. So, you go on, go on. Let's try again. Oh my God. Hello. Teresa. Come inside. Bye. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Is this your doll? Yes, it's a motanka-doll. - She is very nice. - Thank you. - This is for you. - Thank you. Jesus Christ, where is this child? Thalia! Why, why are you hiding in the basement? Jesus Christ, I was worrying, my dear. Let's find mommy and daddy. Is something wrong? Our lodgers. They still barely tolerate each other. Bertha, what really matters is that they are friendly to us. Yes. But the way they greet each other is strange. What can we do? There is a long history of ancient quarrels between Poles and Ukrainians. - Isaac, I mean... - I have to go. My clients. You never have time to talk to me. Still I always have time to... Goodbye. Joseph, do you remember that tomorrow is a day off? Yes, I remember. Mommy. Yes. Is it Epiphany Eve tomorrow? Yes, my dear. And what did you do on Epiphany Eve when you were a child? On this holiday, the whole family went to my grandmother's. In the evening, we put on various whimsical clothes, turned the casing inside out and made a goat. I put on my grandmother's red kerchief. And we went from neighbor to neighbor, sang Christmas carols, received treats, and invited neighbors for Epiphany Eve. And we made our wishes. - And did they come true? - Yes. My wish came true. I have always dreamed of teaching people to sing. Was it because you sang Shchedryk? No, I first heard Shchedryk when I was an adult. It was in Kyiv, in a big hall. My father worked there. This charming music was written by Mr. Leontovych. He was a very good man. He was your grandfather's friend. However, you are right. After that I decided to become a choirmaster. Mommy. Can I put on your grandmother's kerchief tomorrow and sing Shchedryk? Of course, you can. Will it come true? My wish. It will come true, but now you have to sleep. Hi. Come for dinner to our place. Thank you. I think we should accept the invitation. This is not our holiday, not Catholic. I guess her parents sent her. I consider this invitation inappropriate. So, are we going? We are not going anywhere. - Please. - What can I do? The visitor has already fallen asleep, and Joseph is playing on and on. He thought he would be paid for it, you know? He's so funny. Mommy. Did I do the right thing by inviting them all? And Teresa too. Of course, it was right. They will not come, anyway. - It's delicious, Sofia. - Thanks. Good evening. May we come in? You are welcome! Teresa! Please. Teresa, where are you going? Yaroslava: Girls, come to my room! - Good evening. - Good evening. Please, take a seat. Just a second. - Girls, I have an idea. - What? Be quite. Come on. Please. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Just a second. Bravo! Very good. Mom, can I play with Yasia? Yes, you can. Maybe you're wasting your time? Don't worry, she will make it. You'll see. She has fire in her eyes. Sofia, Yaroslava, to the basement, hurry. I have to go to the garrison. Mykhailo? What happened? War. Soviet troops will enter our city in the next few hours. Please keep calm and order. We urge you not to leave your work at enterprises. Let's welcome with dignity the fraternal army of Soviet liberators. Long live friendship and the united Soviet people! Hey, Comrade. How do we get to Griundelska Street? Griulvadska? Good afternoon, Mr. officer. What?! Do I look like a Mister?! - Where is the street? - I guess you need Griunvaldska? It's over there. Let's go! - Are you alright? - I'm fine, thank you. It's awful! He pushed him! Don't be so nervous. Please, calm down. I hope everything will change soon. I don't know. Listen, we need to fix it. Let me do it. Good evening. I came for Teresa. Girls! Let her stay with here. Alright. Want some tea? No, thank you, it's too late. I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Good night. Wanda Kalinowska? You have 15 minutes to pack your things. Where are you taking me? Go pack. One person is allowed to take one bag. - What may I take? - Questions are not allowed. Is there a maid in the house? We had a maid, but she left at the beginning of the war. What kind of war? This is the liberation. Remember that. Walk. May I leave the key to my neighbors? Speak Russian. Damn Pole. I will give the keys to the neighbors. I'm coming. Whose children are these? Mine. Do you play? The key. Take care of her. Walk. Move. Sofia. - Mom is not coming now? - She's not. Teresa, where did your mother hide the papers? Papers with seals. Let's play. No, I can't. - Why? - I have an important mission. - Which one? - I have to give a signal if someone comes. Who is coming? I'm with you. Last night military men took away Mrs. Wanda. Who told you? Did you see it? Did you tell anything to Teresa? Do not tell her. Maybe Mrs. Wanda will be back soon. Are you sure you don't know that? Teresa, take your things. I want to see my mother. Mom will be back soon. And you will stay with us and Yasia for now. Let's go now. It's nice here, but when you have trees in bloom, Sofia continues: it snows here. My dear, I love you so much and I will come to you soon. Snow. I want it like there. Germans are in the city. Where are you going? I won't let you go now! Holy Mary, when will you get tired? Run outside, outside. Help Thalia. Isaac, why are you wearing a jacket? It's warm outside. I can't go to the new authorities without a jacket. In his speech, the German said that he was very kind to the Jews. After his departure, Jews always miss him. Why do they want our whole family to come? Maybe, they just want to register us, so that we could live and work further. I'm worried for some reason. - What's happening? - A rat. A rat. It's alright. Just scatter the poison. Well, I'll do it now. There must be some poison in the basement. Are you going to pay a visit to someone? No. The new authorities have sent for us. Where is the rat? It has ran away. They also summoned all our Jewish musicians. We were told that today we are playing without them. Bertha. My love, stay with the girls. I will go there alone. No, I'm going with you. And what about the girls? And the girls... Would you mind the girls stay with you? - Of course. - Thank you. I'm going with you. Next time. Dinah, your parents will be back soon, and you wait for them with us. I don't want to. Listen to Mrs. Sofia and Mr. Mykhailo. Don't worry. We'll be back soon. Mom, are you crying? No. Keep an eye on Thalia, alright? Mommy. What happened? Isaac and Bertha haven't returned yet. Must be Herschkovichs. - Maria. - Did they come? They say that tonight all the Jews... My God... I'm leaving. I will go to my relatives, to the village. I can take Thalia with me. How will you cope with them all? Thalia? No, I won't let you take her. Either both of them or neither. I see. Hug the girls from me. Well. May God protect you. Good morning. Good morning. - Where are you going? - Home. Dad and Mom came while you were sleeping. And then they left again. - Where? - For a new job. Let's have breakfast together. Your parents wanted you to stay here, then they would come and take you home. Mom will be back soon. Sit here. Let me help you. Teresa, Yaroslav, wake up! It's time for breakfast. Give me your hand. Nice girl. What do you want for breakfast? Hooray! Breakfast! Move! Move! Move! Girls! Yaroslava! Girls! Girls! Mom, you've spoiled the game. Girls, listen to me. German soldiers are in the city. From now on, you are not allowed to go outside, and come close to the windows. Is that clear? They can take you too. Mrs. Sofia, Is something wrong? We need a place for you to hide. The Germans check all the apartments. Yesterday, they were three houses away from us. They will be here today or tomorrow. Come on, I'll show you something. This is uncle Joseph's safe. When he was going to America, he hid all sorts of valuables here. He said when I would grow up I would be able to use it too. Probably, I have grown up already. I guess it is not enough space for two here. Did the Germans take our parents? We don't know that. They won't come back, will they? Dinah, don't let the girls look out the windows, okay? - Good night. - Good night. Let me help you. Have you heard they will arrest those who are hiding Jews. But these are just children. I will not give them Thalia and Dinah. I'm just scared. Stay at home. I will take care of everything myself. No, I can handle it. You're at work every day anyway. I hate this restaurant and these Germans. I don't have much choice. At least some money. Do you think I enjoy playing at the restaurant every day and looking at these ugly faces? Don't worry. Dinah is grown up, she understands everything, she will help. Will it ever end? We have to fight. How? You are alone, and they have the whole army. Where are you going? Go to bed. I'll be right back. Aren't you afraid of God? Damn your God. There is enough stuff for everyone. Put down the bags! Put down the bag. It's not over! Watch your head. Passport, please. - Do you play? - Yes. Should I show you my hands? Children. Well. Goodbye. Alright, come here, my dear. It's alright. Dinah! Dinah. Dinah. Bring some water! Dinah, Dinah. It's alright. Give me your hand. Let me help you. Here, have a drink. There is no air there. Dinah, come here. Be careful. Enough space now? Go, play with the girls. Sofia, play something loud. - Girls, what are you doing? - We are making varenyky. - This is challah. - What? The holiday bread. Go now, do not interfere. Blessed are you, Lord, our God, King of the universe, who brings forth bread from the earth. - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. We have a tradition - on this day we wish everyone to be mentioned in the "Book of Life" I wish this to you and to all my family. Where is the New Year tree? Sweetie, this is another New Year. We do not put the New Year tree now. Take the apples. Would you mind if I won't eat apples. I don't like them. Teresa, we eat apples with honey to have a sweet year. Thank you, Mrs. Sofia, Mr. Mykhailo, for the holiday, although it is foreign to you. Don't say that. You are like a family to us. That is why your holidays are not foreign to us. Make a wish, because today is a holiday and it will definitely come true. Today is not the day for this song. Let her sing. Sing, and I will make a wish. - Hello. - Take this. You better go now. Mykhailo! Talia, get down immediately! I want to go outside! Get down right now, we are not allowed! - Where's Talia? - She wanted to go outside. Talia! Talia! - I'll go and look for her. - No, I'll go. It's dangerous. Thalia! Thalia! Thalia! Thalia! The Germans! Hide! I won't go without Thalia. A Jew? What is your name? What is your name? Go. - What's happening? - She is a Jew! - She is my niece. - A Jew! - Show the documents! - I have them at home. Go. Now! I just take the documents. Hurry up. Where are her parents? In Siberia. Why wasn't she deported? She was ill. They thought that they would come back soon and would take the child. Name? Tell them your name. Teresa Kalinowska. And she? My daughter. Well. Goodbye. Where is Thalia? What's happened, my dear? Why are you crying? - What's happened? - Rat bit me. Hello. I warned you! Respected people spend their leisure time here. The officers of the Great Germany. Why do they have to wait for you? I told everyone to come ten minutes earlier! I just ran home to take the guitar. I allowed you to work two jobs. Now you can lose both. You will work for free for a week. That's it! One more delay and you will be fired. Mrs. Sofia! Thalia is getting worse again. Mom, will she get better? - Who is there? - Please come with me! The child is sick! She has fever! A rat bit her! I won't go - it's curfew! - She is just a child. - Go away! Help! I'll give you everything I have! Everything! She is dying! - I beg you! - Go away! They will execute us for this. I beg you! I beg you! She needs a doctor! She needs a doctor! Excuse me. Could you, please, sign it for us? We are your biggest fans for many years. I even remember all your parts. Thank you. Pardon me. I've been nervous about being late. It's OK. The plane has just landed. We have been waiting for this day for so long. We will meet her at last. I'll spend the whole life in that damn clock. I will not go there again. And I want mom and dad to return. Illl I want to sing. Not to be afraid of anyone. I want to go on the big stage to sing Shchedryk. Why Shchedryk? Because Shchedryk makes people better. And you will not need to hide. Such a long time to wait. Well, girls, it's enough for today. Dresses are ready. You can try them on. - Take it. - Thanks. - Thank you, mom. - Thanks. Girls, what are you doing? When Fritz took his hussars, who were lined up under the branches. Dad, look how beautiful we are! Really beautiful. And I have something for you, too. - It's beautiful. - Really beautiful. Beautiful. It's heavy. Well, shall we hang it on the Christmas tree? So. Where? Like this. How long do you think Dinah will have to sit in that clock? I have an idea. You will go to the Germans to sing carol. Alright. Will it ever end? The war cannot last forever. I have a feeling that you are hiding something. For mom. For Thalia. For Mr. Isaac. For Mrs. Bertha. For dad. Me and dad made toys for Christmas. Lanterns. - Where's Yasya? - I don't know, she was somewhere here. Yaroslava! - Please, don't Kkill... - Please, accept my apologies, officer. Your daughter sings very nice. I've never heard a child singing like that. What did she say? She wished you good luck in the coming year. On this day, children traditionally sing for those who they respect. You're a nice girl. You speak German well. I studied German at school. In Germany, we traditionally give treats to children. Wait here. Your daughter has a lovely voice. Thank you very much. - Here, take this. - Thank you. I hope you will serve the good of the Great Germany. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Where have you been? At the Germans. Never! You here me? Never ask anything from the Germans! Haven't I told you that?! I just thought I would sing Shchedryk everything would be fine. Mrs. Sofia, don't berate Yaroslava. I asked her to do it. How can you? If not for them, Thalia would be alive. Don't you realize? Girls, the time will come for you to sing as much as you want. Don't even make a step behind the door. Is that clear? Take it. She has a beautiful voice. I have never heard such a voice. When she was singing, it reminded me of my childhood. The feast of the Three Holy Kings. My mother made a coat and a crown for me and my brother. Then we went from house to house and sang songs. Well. These are just childhood memories. Do you know what I thought? What? It would be a good opportunity. No, Irma, I would not do that. Alright. Holy Mary, why does it take so long? I worry about Dinah. Very good. I'm tired. Well. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. We must use sparingly. The Germans pay us pennies. Today, Krampe told me to teach his son. I can barely stand it. Dad, play for us. May 1? Yes, but quietly. Please. - Let's do it. - I'll bring it to you. Here you are. Hi. Greetings. You remember. And even seized several cannons. Suddenly, they heard rumble and thunder. A cloud of dust lit above the battlefield, Maria could hardly see what was happening there. I hope the girls will be fine. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I haven't been to the theater for a long time. Do you remember how we first met in Kyiv? At the conservatory. It was the end of summer. They played Beethoven that day. And I found myself next to a charming girl. And you looked at me all the time instead of listening to the music. I order all women to go home, and men to go to the hall. Did you hear? Women out, men to the hall. Move! Move! - I love you. - To the hall. Mom, what happened? It's alright. - Where is dad? - Daddy will be back soon. Go to bed. I'm not going without you, I'm scared. Why? Don't be afraid. Everything will be fine. Mr. Krampe. He is not here. Mom. Wait. Mom. What are you doing? Play something. Don't cry, please. You are strong, I know. I think something has happened to the neighbors. Her husband was executed yesterday. I hope she will be able to continue teaching Heinrich. Of course. The teacher will continue giving lessons. Moreover, he shows real progress and he likes it. I feel sorry for her and the girl. Heinrich likes her. They may lose the apartment. Mom, want to play! Yes, we are going to play, my dear. We are done with the check. Let's get out. Hurry up, Eugen! Girls, close the door. Get out. Thank you. Did the Germans give it to you? Are we going to eat it? Do you want to starve to death? No. Bring some water then. Did I make it wrong? Did I make it wrong? No. Let's go. That's enough for today. Mom, when are we going to eat? How much does it cost? Four. Alright. - Girls, let's go to the basement. - I'm not going. There are rats there! Girls, why don't you understand? I want you to live. Who is there? I've finally found the house. I have nowhere else to go. I don't know where mom and dad are. There were shooting and tanks. Mrs. Sofia, he is a murderer. My sister died because of him. He must go away. Dinah, he is a child like you are. He did nothing wrong. His parents probably died. Are we supposed to forgive him everything? Heinrich did not kill anyone. We cannot convict him of his father's crimes. Please. Thanks. Now only Heinrich. All together. What are you looking for? Speak Russian. She can't. Your husband was collaborating with the Germans. He wasn't collaborating, he was fighting against them. He was killed for that. Why are you hiding a German bastard then? Are you going to deny the connection with the Nazis? He's just a child, he doesn't understand anything. We'll handle it. Whose is this girl? She's mine. NKVD Officer 2: She must be kidding. Mrs. Sofia is like a mother to me. She saved me from the Germans. You are coming with us. Where? Children - to the orphanage. And you, ma'am, is under arrest. Why? Let me go! Let me go! - Let me go! Let me go! - Stop it! I told you to go out! Let go! They are just children! Move! Mrs. Sofia! - Stop! Freeze! - No! No! Freeze! Get in the car! Move! Well, Sofia Mykolaivna, are you going to speak? Or will you continue objecting everything? We know everything about your husband. He was a member of a criminal organization. Did you join it too? My husband was executed by the Germans. I've heard about it. I would like to know how you contacted the OUN? I didn't. What did you do? What did you teach the children? - I taught children to sing. - Speak Russian! I taught them choral songs. What songs were these? Different. Mostly Ukrainian folk songs. Really? Are there such folk? Ukrainian? You're wrong, dear. Take her away! Girls! This is Yaroslava Ivaniuk, she can sing very well. Would you mind making her the soloist of our choir? She has no future; she is the daughter of a political prisoner. Unlike Natasha. But she doesn't have a good ear for music. Her father was awarded the order. Posthumously. Natasha. Come on the stage. Sing. - They sing well. - These are the best. Children! We have the honor to welcome honorable guests. Comrade Plakhin and Comrade Komarov came to congratulate us on the New Year. Let's greet them. Happy New Year, comrades children. We wish you success in your studies and work. Be ready to struggle for the achievements of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Always ready! Good for you! Maybe someone else wants to read a poem or sing a song about the New Year? May I? Of course you may. Applauds. Take your seats. I want to sing a song that brings people joy. Sing now. I don't understand what you expect from me? The authorities have already made concessions to you, so take your daughter and this Jew Gershkovich. But you are not allowed to take Ivaniuk. But she is not a stranger to me. The law says she is. Her father was a criminal and her mother too. So go to your Poland, and Ivaniuk is Ukrainian. She is not subject to resettlement. But can I at least meet her? No, she is in a juvenile penal colony. For what?! There is no place for the ones like her in the Soviet society. I'm afraid they again didn't allow her to leave the country. I used all my connections to take her here. Yaroslava.
