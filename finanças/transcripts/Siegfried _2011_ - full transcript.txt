Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Oh, what a torment, slaving in vain! My strongest swords would suit a giant... but that insolent Siegfried just snaps them in two. Still, there's one sword he could not shatter... the sword Nothung! But I cannot fuse its pieces together. lf only l could mend it, all my toil would be repaid. Fafner the savage dragon... lurks deep within these woods... huge and terrifying, guarding the Nibelung treasure. lf Siegfried could kill the beast... the Nibelung ring would then be mine. But only one sword could do the deed... only Nothung. But I cannot mend Nothung! What torment, slaving in vain! No sword l make is good enough. But the boy insists I keep trying, and rails at me when l give up. Come on! Eat him up! Send it away! Why bring home a bear? To hurry you up! I want my sword! No need for that! Look, it's already done! Well, Bruin, back to the woods! Fine. Hunt for bears, but why bring one home? To have a better friend than you'll ever be! I looked for one in the woods, playing a tune on my horn. A bear ran out, growling. Even so, he was nicer than you. I brought him to convince you to make my sword. You'll like this new one. Not if it's weak. ls this a toy? This little stick? So much for that one! Take the pieces! Now will you keep bragging? You told me I'd battle giants with one of your swords. But all of them break with a single blow. I should break you to bits as well. Once and for all! You're raving like a madman, and ungrateful as ever! How quickly he forgets everything l've done for him. You should be grateful for all I've done. But you never listen to me. How about some food? l'll get you some roasted meat. Or would you prefer some broth? lt's very nice! I can feed myself! Keep that slop! Is this the reward for my love? For all my tender concern? l raised you from a whimpering baby... clothing you, feeding you, caring for your every need. As you grew up, l made you toys, and even a fine hunting horn. l gave you wise counsel to sharpen your wits. I slave at home, while you roam as you please. l worry and work for you alone, poor old dwarf that l am! And for what? Never one word of thanks, just abuse and scorn! l've learned a lot from you. But l've never learned the lesson you most wanted to teach me... How to stand the sight of you! If you make me food and drink, I lose my appetite. And if you make my bed, l can't sleep in it. The things you try to teach me are things I don't need to learn. Everything about you disgusts me! I see you there, shuffling, slinking, nodding, and blinking. And l want to wring your neck! That's the only way to deal with you! So tell me this, if you can. When l run away from home, why do I always come back to you? Birds, trees, and fish are dearer to me than you. What makes me return? If you know, tell me. My child, that only shows your affection for me. But I can't stand you! You know that! That's just because you're so wild at heart. All children long for their parents, and love is the name for that longing. You long for your dear old Mime, which proves you love me. Just as birds nurture their young in the nest... so, too, have you been nurtured by wise, caring Mime. So, Mime, since you're so wise, tell me something. Birds sing to one another when spring returns. You've told me it's because they're mates, male and female. They make a nest for their young, tending them till they learn to fly. lt's the same with deer, with foxes and wolves, too. l've seen the fathers and mothers caring for their young ones. They taught me what love is. So l never rob them of their young. But where is your female, that I may call her mother? Don't be a dunce! Are you a bird or a fox? "l raised you from a whimpering baby..." But who made that baby? Just you, without a mother? You must believe me. I'm your mother and father combined. You're lying to me! The young look like their parents. I've seen animals and trees reflected in the stream. The sun and clouds, too... just as they are in the sky. l've seen myself there, too. And I don't look like you, any more than fish look like toads. What nonsense! Now at last l understand why... when l run off, l always return. It's because l have to find out who my father and mother are? Father and mother? A ridiculous question. Must l choke it out of you? I even had to force you to teach me to speak. Now out with it! Who are my father and mother? You'll kill me yet! Let me be and l'll tell! What an ungrateful child! I'll tell you why you hate me. We're not related in any way. Yet you owe me your life. Out of kindness, I took you in. And this is my reward! One day I found a woman weeping in the woods. I brought her to our cave... and to the warmth of our hearth. She was with child. She gave birth to him here. The birth was hard. I helped as best I could. She suffered terribly! She died. But Siegfried... he survived. She died, then, because of me? She entrusted you to me. l cared for you well. No trouble was too much. I raised you from a whimpering baby. Yes, you said so before! But tell me, why am I called Siegfried? Your mother said with that name you'd grow up strong and handsome. But I clothed you and... What was my mother's name? I barely recall it. Her name! Tell me! l don't remember. No, wait... Sieglinde, that's it. She put you in my care. And my father's name? I never knew it. My mother didn't say? Only that he'd died in battle. And since you were fatherless, she gave you to me. That's why I raised you and saw to your needs. Enough! Why should I believe you? What if you're lying? - What can l say? - I can't just take your word. Show me some proof! Your mother gave me this as a meager reward for my help. Just a broken sword. Your father used it in his last fight. And you'll mend it to make the sword I need! Hurry, Mime! Come on! Instead of the trash you give me, weld these pieces together! And if I find any flaw, l'll take it out on your hide! I swear l'll have my sword. This weapon shall be mine today! What will you do with the sword today? I'll go out into the world, and l'll never come back again! Nothing binds me to you, for l am not your son! Free as a bird, l'll fly away on the wandering wind... never to see you again! Wait! Stop! Come back! Away he goes! And here l sit. So many worries, and now l have one more. My plan isn't working. What am l to do? I must keep him here. But how to get him to Fafner's cave? And how can I mend this sword? No furnace is hot enough, and no hammer strong enough! The Nibelung's greed, toil, and sweat cannot make Nothung whole. Greetings, learned smith! Do not begrudge a weary guest the comfort of your hearth. Who's this? Who's found me in this deserted forest? "Wanderer" l am called. I've come from afar, having roamed across the world. Then keep roaming, old man, if "Wanderer" is your name. Good folk have welcomed me gladly. Many even offer gifts, for bad luck falls on grudging hosts. l've had bad luck all my life. Do you bring me more now? I have learned much in my travels and shared it with others. I have given sage counsel to many, easing their troubled hearts. l don't need anyone to teach me anything. All l want is to be alone! No loitering here! Many think themselves wise, yet don't know what they need most. What l say has been useful to those who value knowledge. Many hoard useless knowledge. But l know all I need to! You can find your own way out! l'll just sit here instead... and challenge you to a battle of wits. My head is yours if I fail to answer any question you ask... if I fail to tell you what you need to know. How can I get rid of this spy? I'll ask tricky questions! All right, you've wagered your head. Take care not to lose it. I've three riddles you must solve. Three times l must answer. You've journeyed far and wide across the earth. So tell me this. What creatures dwell in the earth's dark caverns? That's where the Nibelungs dwell. Nibelheim is their realm. They are elves of darkness. Alberich once ruled over them. With his magical ring he enslaved them. With the treasure they amassed, he hoped to rule the world. What else do you wish to know? Wanderer, you know much of the caves beneath the earth. Now tell me, which beings live on the earth above them? Upon the earth's broad back live the giants. Riesenheim is their home. Fasolt and Fafner, two brothers, envied Alberich's might. They won his great treasure, along with the powerful ring. The brothers fought over it. Fasolt was slain. And now, transformed into a dragon, Fafner guards the gold. You have one question left. You know much about the earth and those who dwell upon it. Now tell me, what race dwells in the clouds on high? The gods dwell there, high in the heavens. Valhalla is their home. They are spirits of light. Wotan, lord of light, is their ruler. From a branch of the World Ash Tree, he carved himself a spear. The tree withered, but the spear endures. And with it Wotan governs all. The shaft of the spear contains the runes of holy laws. Whoever wields the spear Wotan made rules over the whole world. The Nibelungs bowed before him, and the giants were subdued. All must acknowledge as master the spear's mighty lord. Tell me, crafty dwarf, have I answered correctly? Do l keep my head? You've saved your head. Now, Wanderer, go on your way! You should have asked something worth knowing... since I wagered my head. You still don't know what you need to. Now let's wager yours. Your greeting was inhospitable. You denied me a place at your hearth. The bet now demands you wager your head. To save it, answer three riddles of mine. Be resolute, Mime, and bold. I left home so long ago. Some of my knowledge is hazy. Now I feel Wotan's eye on me. His stare freezes my wits. Still, I must be clever. Wanderer, ask what you will. With luck, perhaps l can save my head. Now, trustworthy dwarf... here's my first question. Tell me the name of the race Wotan has treated most harshly... and yet loves more than all the rest. l know little of heroic lore, but I can answer that. The Wälsungs are the ones he loved, yet treated most harshly. He begat Siegmund and Sieglinde, the luckless Wälsung twins. Siegfried is their child, the Wälsungs' courageous son. So tell me, Wanderer, do I keep my head? You named the race! You're clever, that's clear! You got the first one fast enough. Now answer the second one. A wily Nibelung is raising Siegfried. When the boy slays Fafner, the dwarf will win the ring and the gold. What sword does Siegfried need to kill the dragon? Nothung... left by Wotan in a tree, meant for the bravest of men. Siegmund claimed the sword, but it shattered on Wotan's spear. A crafty smith kept the pieces... knowing that Nothung is the sword Siegfried needs to kill the dragon. So, have I saved my head again? You're the wisest of the wise! How sly to make Siegfried your tool. But, being so sly, tell me more. Who will weld the pieces together and make Nothung new again? Those pieces! The sword! l can't put them back together! No hammer or heat suffices to mend this steel! No blacksmith knows how, not even the best! Who can forge the sword if l cannot? Thrice you posed a riddle. Thrice I met the challenge. But you asked about useless things, not what you truly need to know. Now I've asked that question for you and won your wily head. I'll tell you who will slay Fafner, you doomed dwarf. Only he who never learned to fear... can forge Nothung anew! So, from now on, guard your head well. l'll leave that prize to him who has never learned to fear. Accursed light! What's that flickering? What's hovering above me? What's that shining through the trees? What's that rustling and roaring? lt's coming this way! Bursting through the woods! Its jaws are wide open! The dragon will catch me! Fafner! Fafner! Finished yet? What about the sword? Where can he be? Mime, where are you hiding? Are you alone, child? Why are you hiding? Where's my sword? The sword? How can l make it? "Only he who never learned to fear..." "can forge Nothung anew." I was too clever to do it. You need help forging? Who can help me now? l've wagered my head away. And now it will fall to him who knows no fear. Don't you hear me? l could escape if only he knew fear. But I never taught him to fear. Fool that l am, I forgot. l hoped he'd learn to love me, but that failed completely. But how can l teach him fear? Why isn't it done? Do you need help? l was studying something l ought to teach you. Studying there, where you were hiding? I was learning all about fear. And what is fear? Something you ought to learn. Even the strongest sword is useless without it. It's your advice that's useless! l promised your mother l'd follow her wise counsel... keeping you from the world until you'd learned fear. Is it some skill I need? Tell me! What is this "fear"? Have you ever been in the woods when darkness falls? And heard a rumbling sound, through the gloom? Blinding flashes surround you. It's coming closer! A terrible roar shakes the trees. Your arms and legs refuse to work. You shudder from head to toe. Your heart pounds so much that you think it will burst! lf you've never felt that way, you don't know what fear is. What a strange feeling that must be! Yet my heart is steady and calm. That shivering and shuddering... that shaking and fainting. Oh, to have those feelings! I long for such delight! Could you teach me this fearing? Can you do it? Follow me and l'll show you. I've thought of a way to teach you. l know of a dragon who eats men alive. lt will teach you what fear is. And where does it live? At the eastern edge of the woods. Near where the world begins? In a hidden cave near there. Take me there to learn fear, and then I'll be off! Be quick! Make me the sword! The sword! Oh, no! Come on, get busy! Accursed steel! I can't weld it. I lack the skill to tame its spell. But one who knows no fear may be able to do it. Always full of excuses! What a bungler! And a liar! l'll take the pieces. Just step aside! My father's sword passes to me, and I will mend it myself! You were too lazy to master my craft. How will you manage it now? If l'd studied with you, I'd know even less! Leave me alone! Or you'll land in the fire! Take the solder I prepared. That won't help with the sword! You'll wear down the file! How will you join the pieces? I'll melt them down and start again. Expert skill is of no use here. His stupidity guides him. Look how hard he works! He files it down with ease! As old as I am, l've never seen the like! He'll forge it because he's fearless. The Wanderer was right. But he'll chop off my head, unless Fafner teaches him fear. Yet, if he learns fear, how will he slay the dragon... and win me the ring? What a terrible dilemma! I must find some way to make him do what I want! Mime, what's the name of this sword l've just ground to bits? Nothung. That's what it's called. Your mother told me so. Nothung! lnvincible sword! How did you come to shatter? l've filed your glory to splinters. Now l'll melt them down! Bellows, fan the fire! ln the forest l cut down a mighty ash tree. l burned its trunk to charcoal and piled it on the hearth. Bellows, fan the fire! Now the charcoal is fiercely blazing! The fire roars up with a shower of sparks... fusing the splinters of steel! Bellows, fan the fire! He'll forge the sword, and then he'll kill Fafner. But when he wins the treasure, how can I take it from him? With cunning, I'll do it, and save my head! After he kills the beast, l'll give him a drink. A potion brewed from herbs. A few drops will put him to sleep. Then I'll kill him with his own sword and take the ring for myself! Nothung! Nothung! Coveted sword! Well, Wanderer... Mime will show you! What do you think of Mime now? Soon Nothung will be mine! Into the water went molten steel, hissing angrily. Hot as it was going in, the water has changed it. Now it has cooled and hardened. And soon it will draw hot blood! l must heat it again and shape it. What's the fool up to now? I'm forging the steel. What mess are you making? The pupil puts his master to shame! Now I'll just act as your cook. While you forge your steel, I'll boil some eggs for your soup. Mime the smith takes up cooking! He's finished with forging now! But if his cooking is like his forging, I'll say, "No, thanks!" He wants to teach me fearing, but needs someone else to do it. He can't even teach what he knows. What a silly old bungler! Hammer, shape me a sturdy sword! Hot blood once stained your gleaming steel. But laughing, you let the blood cool on your blade. Now you grow hot with the hammer's blows... sputtering sparks of anger and offended pride. That sword he's forging will kill the dragon. And the drink l'm brewing will help me kill him! My scheme will work, and l'll reap my reward! l laugh at your sparks! And you laugh back at me! With fire and hammer l've shaped the sword again. I'll turn its rosy blush to a cold, hard gleam. My brother's magic ring will be mine at last! Alberich and all the Nibelungs will hail me as their lord. The slighted dwarf will be king! They'll marvel at my wealth. All will bow before me. Nothung! Nothung! Coveted sword! You're rejoined to your hilt. You once lay in pieces, but you'll never break again! You shattered, and my father died. But his son has made you new! Your blade gleams brightly, your edge cuts smartly. Mime will be king! Mime the bold! Nothung! Coveted sword! I've brought you back to life! You once lay in pieces. But now you shine defiantly! Let villains fear your gleam, for you will slay them! Hey, Mime! Watch this! See what my sword can do! ln the pitch-black forest I keep watch at Fafner's cave... straining my eyes and ears, spying and waiting. Fateful day, do you dawn at last? What is that light shining there? What is that light piercing the gloom? lt runs like a fiery horse through the trees. Can it be the one who will slay Fafner, the dragon? The light has died out. lt's dark once more. lt's still night, then. Who's that in the shadows? l've come to the forest by night. Who's lurking there in the gloom? You dare come here? Out of my sight! Begone, villain! Thief! Alberich, why are you here, watching over Fafner's cave? You! What new mischief are you planning? You've caused enough woe. Meddler, leave me in peace! l came to watch, not to meddle. Do you dare block the Wanderer's way? You villainous schemer! Do you think l'd be foolish enough to let you steal my ring again? Beware! Now l know your every trick... your every weakness! You built your fortress with my gold and used my ring to pay the giants. You struck a bargain with the giants... preserved in the runes of your spear. You cannot take back the treasure you agreed to pay. If you did, this mighty spear of yours would crumble in your hands! Yet no treaty, no runes bind me to you, scoundrel! My spear made you bow to my will, and it remains with me for war. Although you boast and threaten, there is fear in your heart. My curse has already doomed the dragon who guards my treasure. Now who will possess it? Will the precious ring fall to me, to the Nibelung once again? That worry causes you endless torment. For if it does, l'll use its power, unlike the stupid giants. So tremble, lord of heroes! My legions will storm Valhalla. And then l, I shall rule the world! l'm aware of your plan, but l'm not concerned. The ring shall be controlled by the one who wins it. What you intend is perfectly clear. Your hopes depend on a hero, descended from your own blood. You raised a youth to pluck the fruit you dared not steal yourself. Beware your brother Mime, not me. He's bringing a boy to slay Fafner. The boy knows nothing of me. The Nibelung is using him. So I say to you, friend, do as you please. But beware! The boy knows nothing about the ring, but Mime is intent on it. And you won't interfere? Whomever l love must find his own way. Let him stand or fall. Only such a hero can help me. Only Mime has designs on the ring? You and he are the only ones. Won't l prevail? A hero is coming to win the gold. Two Nibelungs contest it. Fafner will die and no longer guard the ring. Whoever wins, wins all. Do you want to know more? The dragon's there. If you warn him he's in danger, he might give you the ring. I'll wake him for you. Fafner! Fafner, awaken! What's the fool doing trying to help me? Who troubles my sleep? Someone who's come to warn you, and to save your life... if you'll reward him with the treasure you guard. What does he want? Waken, Fafner! Dragon, awake! A hero's coming, intent on your death. l'll devour him. The boy is fearless, and his sword is sharp. The ring is all he wants. Give it to me instead. I'll ward off the attack, and you'll keep your gold and your life. I'll keep all I have. Let me sleep. Well, Alberich, we lost out! Revile me no more, and heed this advice. Everything in nature follows its own laws. You cannot change that. l leave this place to you. Make a stand. Contend with Mime, your brother. You understand his nature. As for the rest... you'll learn that soon enough! There he rides on his fiery horse, leaving me to my worry and shame. Keep laughing, carefree gods, you heedless immortals! One day I'll see you all die! As long as the gold still gleams, wily Alberich will keep watch... plotting and planning your downfall! This is the place. Stay right here. This is where I learn what fear is? You've led me a long way. We walked all night to get here. Now begone, so l can learn fear. And if l don't, l'm going on alone. If you don't learn fear here, then you never will. You see that dark cave? A dragon lives deep inside. He's ferocious and huge! He has a terrifying pair ofjaws! He could swallow you with one gulp! Then I'd better close his jaws for him! Venom drips from his gaping maw. One drop will shrivel your flesh. Then l'll approach him from the side. lf he coils his giant tail around you, your bones will break like glass. Then I'll stay clear of his tail, and keep him well in sight. But tell me... does this dragon have a heart? A pitiless, cruel heart! The same place as ours? Yes, of course. Nothung's ready to rip it out. Is that what you mean by fear? lf that's all you can teach, be off! l won't learn fear today. Wait till you see the dragon. You'll shake all over! When your eyes grow dim, and you're weak from fear... then you'll be grateful, and recall how Mime loves you. I said not to love me! Just go away and leave me alone! l'm sick of looking at you! Always nodding and blinking! Why don't you leave me in peace? I'll leave you now. l'll wait for you by the stream. You stay here and watch. At midday the dragon will come out, looking for something to drink. Yes, wait by the stream. l'll send him straight there. l won't stick Nothung into his guts until he has gobbled you up. So go! Run as fast as you can, and don't come back! But after the fight, you'll need some refreshment. Call out if you need me... or when you've learned to fear! Fafner and Siegfried... Let them kill each other! He's not my father! l'm glad of that! I never saw the woods look so green, or the sun so bright... now that I'm free of him at last! What did my father look like? Like me, of course! lf Mime had a son, wouldn't he look just like him? Ugly, grizzled and gray, misshapen and shambling... floppy-eared and bleary-eyed! I never want to see him again! But, I wonder what my mother was like. l really cannot imagine. Surely she had eyes like a doe. Only more lovely. But when she bore me, why did she have to die? Must every human mother die when she bears a son? How sad that would be! Ah, how this son longs to see his mother! My mother... a female human. Pretty bird, I've never seen you. Do you live here? If only I could understand what it's singing! Perhaps it would tell me something about my mother. Mime said you could learn what the birds are singing about. Could that really be? l'll try to imitate its song. That way, perhaps, l'd understand what it's saying. lt stops and waits. And now it's my turn! That's still not right. Little bird, I must be too stupid to learn to play your song. I've been put to shame. lt's still watching and listening. Well, listen to my horn! l can play it better than this reed. Here's a little tune l play. It helps me find friends in the woods. lt's brought me a wolf and a bear. Let's see who answers now... perhaps the true comrade l seek. Aha! My tune's attracted a pretty playmate! Who comes here? A talking beast! Maybe you can help me. l've never learned to fear. Will you teach me? Is this courage or arrogance? Whatever it is, l'll kill you if you won't teach me fear. l came out to drink. And now l've found food! What pretty teeth! Such a fine set ofjaws! But l'd better shut them for you. Enough idle chatter! They're ready to eat you up. Savage beast! l wouldn't like that. So I'll kill you instead. Come, insolent boy! Die, merciless beast! Nothung is buried in your heart! Who are you, daring youth? Who has struck me down? Who drove you to this murderous deed? Someone told you to kill. You didn't know about such things. I don't know much, not even who l am. lf I have killed you, you yourself are to blame. Bright-eyed youth... I'll tell you who it is you've killed. The mightiest giants, the brothers Fasolt and Fafner, have fallen. l killed my brother, Fasolt, to gain all the gold the gods paid us. Then, as a dragon, I guarded it. Now Fafner, the last of the giants, is laid low by a boy. Look to yourself now, youthful hero. Be wary of him who made you kill. He intends to kill you, too. Mark my downfall. Heed my words. Tell me where l come from, since death gives you such wisdom. Perhaps my name will help you. Siegfried. That's what l'm called. The dead can teach me nothing. My living sword will guide me instead. His blood burns like fire! l seem to understand the birds now! ls it from tasting the blood? That friendly bird has come back. Siegfried has won the Nibelung gold! Let him find it in the cave. The magic Tarnhelm will help him, and with the ring he will rule the world! I thank you for your advice. I'll do as you say. What are you doing? Hateful brother, why are you here? You hope to steal my gold? Get away! Why are you here? Am l disturbing you, you thief? You won't take what l've worked so hard for. Who took the gold from the Rhine? Who made the magic helmet? Was it you? What do you know? lt was only the ring that taught you how. Then where is the ring? The giants stole it, but soon it will be mine! It's the boy who won it! l raised him, and I deserve it! Does that give you the right to crown yourself king? The mangiest dog deserves the ring more! Then keep the ring for yourself. Rule the world, but treat me fairly. I only want a trifle. Let me keep the helmet and we'll share the spoils. Share? Keep the Tarnhelm? Then l'd never be safe from you. So that's it? l end up with nothing? Nothing! Nothing at all! Then I won't give up anything! And I'll turn Siegfried on you! But look! He's coming back. With the shiniest trinkets, no doubt. - He's got the Tarnhelm! - And the ring! Curse it! The ring! Try to get it from him! Its rightful owner will get it yet! I can't tell what these are, but the bird said to take them. l found them on the pile of treasure. At least l'll have a trophy of my fight with the dragon... even if l didn't learn fear. Siegfried owns both helmet and ring. But he must not trust evil Mime. He's tasted the dragon's blood. Now he can hear Mime's deepest thoughts. He's wondering what it is he's won. Could the Wanderer have told him the secrets of the treasure? l'll have to be very clever... deceiving him with friendly words. l greet you, Siegfried! Well, have you learned fear? I haven't found a teacher yet. But you killed the dragon. Didn't you two get along? He was evil, but not quite as evil as some who are still alive. And he wasn't as hateful as the one who said to kill him. Well, you won't have to see me again when l close your eyes for good! Now that you've done what I wanted, I'll steal what you've won. You've always been easy to fool. So you mean to do me harm? Did l say that? Listen, little boy, l've always hated you! l didn't raise you out of love, but just to win Fafner's treasure. So hand it over! Siegfried, my son, do as I say... or else I'll have to kill you. l'm happy to hear you hate me. But why should I let you kill me? When did I say that? You misunderstood. You're tired after the fight. I've made you a refreshing drink. While you hammered the sword, I brewed it just for you. Drink it down. Then I'll take your sword and your treasure. So you plan to steal my sword, and everything I won? Why twist my words? Though I carefully hide my thoughts, you still misunderstand me! Now listen to me! Listen to Mime's words. Drink what I kindly made for you... grudgingly, as always, ungrateful lout that you are! A drink would be good. What's in this one? Just drink! Trust me! You'll soon be unconscious. And while you sleep, I can easily steal the treasure. But you might wake up. So l'll take your sword and hack off your head! Then I'll have some peace, and the ring! You'll kill me in my sleep? Now, really! Did l say that? I only intend to hack your head off. l hate you for all the grief you've ever caused me. But even if I didn't hate you, I'd kill you to get my way. So my Wälsung, spawn of Wolfe... taste the drink, and choke to death! Have a taste of my sword instead! Nothung has repaid his treachery! It's for such tasks that l forged it. Lie there with the hoard you plotted so long to get. And you'll have someone else to protect you from thieves. The dragon will lie there, too! Watch over the gold, you and your greedy enemy. And may you both find peace at last! How warm l am! My blood races through me. The sun's high in the heavens, blazing down on me. l'll rest here, where it's cooler. Little bird, go on singing. You were interrupted. l've seen you playing among the trees with your brothers and sisters. But I am all alone, without brothers or sisters. My mother died. My father was killed. Their son never knew them. My only companion was an ugly old dwarf. He wanted to do me harm, so l had to kill him. Kindly bird, tell me this. Could you help me find a loving friend? Can you guide me? Although I've looked and looked, l still haven't found one. Dear friend, surely you can help. You've given me good advice. Sing on! I'll listen to your song. Siegfried killed the evil dwarf! Now let him hear of a glorious bride! Atop a mountain she sleeps, protected by fire. lf he braves the flames and wakens her from sleep... Brünnhilde will be his bride! Your words fill me with yearning! What burns in my heart? What feeling races through me? What can it be, dear friend? Happy even in grief, I sing of love. Gladly l weave my song from woe. Only lovers understand it. I'll gladly leave these woods to reach the mountain. Can I walk through the fire? Can I awaken the bride? No cowardly man can waken the bride. Only one who knows no fear! One who knows no fear? Little bird, that's me! I tried to learn fear today. I couldn't learn it from Fafner. Now I long to learn it from Brünnhilde! Where do I find the mountain? Show me the way! l'll follow wherever you fly! Waken, Wala! Wala, arise! Awake from your lingering sleep! I summon you here. Arise! Arise from the dark, misty earth! Erda! Eternal woman! From gloomy chasms, rise into light. With spells I call to you. Waken from your dreams of wisdom. Omniscient one! Fount of wisdom! Erda! Ancient and wise! Wala, awake! Strong is the call. Potent spells have awakened me. I am roused from wisdom's dream. Who drives away my sleep? It is I who have awakened you. My magic stirs you from dreams. l roamed the world to gain knowledge, to learn ancient wisdom. No one is wiser than you. You know nature's deepest secrets. Where life is, your spirit moves. When men ponder, they seek your wisdom. You possess boundless knowledge, and so I seek your counsel. That is why l have awakened you. My sleep is dreaming. My dreaming is thought. My thought creates wisdom. As I sleep, the Norns keep vigil... weaving the strands of all l know. Why not seek out their counsel? They weave as they must, unable to alter what is fated. l have come here to learn how to halt a turning wheel. Human deeds cast a dark cloud upon my soul. Even l once yielded to a conqueror's force. I bore Wotan a loyal daughter. She gathers heroes to battle for him. She is valiant, and wise as well. Why waken me, instead of seeking out Erda's and Wotan's child? Seek out the Valkyrie, Brünnhilde? But she defied her father as he warred against himself. What he wished done, he dared not do himself. She, full of pride and rash defiance, did what her father would not. Now, in atonement, she lies asleep upon the rocky heights. She may waken only to him who will fearlessly make her his wife. What could l learn from her? Confusion reigns as I wake. The world whirls in wild disorder. Was the Valkyrie imprisoned in sleep while her all-knowing mother slept? Does he who taught defiance now punish the defiant? Does he who praised action now condemn the bold? Does he who enforced treaties now rule by falsehood and lawlessness? Let me descend again, back to the sleep of wisdom. No, mother of all, you may not leave. My magic holds you here. You have lodged the thorn of anguish in Wotan's heart. You made him fearful of his doom, binding his spirit with dread. You are wisest of all. Tell me, how can this god overcome his anguish? You are not what you claim to be! Why come here, why trouble my sleep? Nor are you what you believe! Your wisdom must bow to my will. Do you know Wotan's will? Now you will learn it, unwise one, then sleep forever, free of care. Facing my downfall, I now feel no fear. l willed it myself. What I decided in pain and sorrow l now carry out in freedom and joy. Though in anger I once offered my realm to greedy Alberich... I now bequeath it all to the brave Wälsung. My chosen hero has never known me, yet he has won the Nibelung's ring. Free of hate, joyous and loving, he is safe from Alberich's curse... for he does not know fear. He will waken Brünnhilde, the child you bore me. She will wisely do what she must to redeem the world. Now sink back into slumber. Dream of my downfall. Whatever may happen, I gladly surrender to eternal youth. Descend, then, Erda! Mother of fear! Return to your eternal sleep! I see Siegfried approaching. My little bird flew off. It led me here with its sweet song. It's gone now. So l'll find the mountain myself, following the path the bird took. Where are you headed, my boy? Who's over there? Perhaps he knows the way. l seek a mountain ringed by fire, and a woman I must awaken. Who told you to wake this woman? A bird sang to me about her. But birds twitter nonsense. How did you understand its song? I tasted the blood of a dragon I killed. Then l understood what the bird was saying. Who told you to kill the dragon? The evil Mime said the beast would teach me to fear. But I slew the dragon before he could gobble me up. And who made the sword that killed him? l made it myself when Mime couldn't. But who made the pieces you forged together? I don't know, but they were useless until l put them together again. No doubt about that! Why are you laughing, old man? Don't keep me here talking! Show me the way if you can. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut! Hold on, lad. lf you think l'm old, you should show me respect. All through my life an old man barred my way! But l knocked him aside. Watch out, or I'll do that to you! What's that hat you're wearing? Is it to hide your face? That's how the Wanderer wears it, striding against the wind. You've lost one eye already, maybe for barring somebody's way. Watch out, or you'll lose the other! l see you know very little. But you know how to get your way. Long ago I lost an eye to gain wisdom. And now it seems you look at me with that very eye. Yet with the eye that remains to me, I still see more clearly than you. You make me laugh. But l'm tired of chatter! Show me the way, or be off! Speak, or move on! You do not know who l am. If you did, you wouldn't insult me... threatening one who holds you dear. Long have l loved your noble kind, but they have felt my anger as well. I prize you as a paragon of heroism. Do not arouse my wrath. It would destroy us both. You still won't tell me, stubborn man? Don't block my way! I must go where the bird was flying. lt flew away to escape the lord of the ravens. lt was right to be fearful! You cannot go where it led you. And who are you to stop me? I am guardian of the mountain. That woman is my captive. Whoever wakes her will rob me of my power forever. A sea of fire surrounds her. lt encircles the rock. And destroys any man who draws near. Look to the sky! You see the fire? It blazes in splendor. Smoke billows, a sea of light rises. The flames will devour you. Then it's through those flames I'll go to find Brünnhilde. If the fire does not frighten you, my spear will bar the way. lt once broke the sword you carry, and it will shatter it again. My father's foe! I've found you! And now I can take revenge! Raise your spear! I'll break it in two! Pass on. I cannot stop you. Without his weapon, the coward retreats! Ah, rapturous glow! Glorious light! The brilliant path opens before me. I'll plunge through the fire. And there l will find my bride. The loving companion I seek! What a haven of peace on these rocky heights. What's that, off in the woods? It's a stallion, fast asleep. What's shining there? What's this glinting steel? Gleaming armor! A man in armor! l feel awed by the sight. Does the helmet press on his brow? l can lift it to ease his sleep. Ah, how fair! Hair shimmering like waves upon a heavenly sea... as radiant as sunlight piercing the billowing mists! He struggles to breathe. Should l undo the armor? Come, sword, cut those straps. This is no man! A fiery spell seizes my heart! My senses are reeling! Whom can I call upon to help me? Mother! Keep me in your thoughts! How am I to wake her, to open her eyes? And when they open, will her gaze strike me blind? Everything whirls around me! I feel a painful longing! My heart pounds! l'm trembling! Am l a coward? Can this be fear? Mother! What has become of your brave son? A woman lies there asleep... and she has taught me to fear! How can I regain my courage? l must rouse myself and wake her. Her lovely mouth is like a delicate flower. Her gentle breathing calms my fears. Her breath is sweet and warm. Awaken... most blessed of women! She does not hear me. Then l will draw life from those sweet lips. Even if, kissing her, I die! Sun, l greet you! Light, I greet you! Hail, glorious day! Long was my sleep. And now I wake. What fearless man has roused me from sleep? l fought my way through the fire. I lifted your armor from you. Siegfried has awakened you. Gods, l greet you! Glorious world! Hail, earth in your glory! My sleep is over now. Siegfried has come to end my sleep. Oh, bless the mother who gave me life! Bless the earth that made me strong. l look into your eyes, and l am blessed. Blessed by your radiant eyes, which smile on my bliss! O Siegfried! Siegfried! Bravest of men! Glorious hero, you have restored me to life. Joy of my world, I have always loved you. You were all l ever cared for! My shield was your shelter before you were born. So long have l loved you, Siegfried. Did my mother not die? Was she only asleep? Innocent child! Your mother can never return. But we are as one, if l am blessed by your love. What you must know, l know for you. l am wise only because I love you. I always loved you. l alone understood Wotan's purpose... though I could never reveal it. I fought for this secret wish, even defying the one who wished it. l was punished, bound to this rock, for that unspoken thought. And what was that thought? Surely you sense it. lt was my love for you. How wonderful your words are, yet l cannot grasp their meaning. l see the light of your eyes. I hear your lovely song. Your words fall so sweetly on my ears. And yet I don't understand them. l cannot grasp the past, for now l see and hear only you. You have taught me fear, binding me with chains of dread. Give me my courage again! l see Grane, my sacred steed, happily grazing where he once slept. Siegfried has awakened us both. l've longed for a sight as lovely as this. For lips that arouse my thirst, for kisses to quench my yearning. There is the shield that guarded heroes. There is the helmet I used to wear. But neither protects me now. A blessed maiden has conquered me... and I came without helmet or shield. There is the shining armor I wore. A sharp sword cut it apart. Without shield or armor, l am a sad and helpless woman. l battled a fire to reach your side. That very fire now sears my heart. The fire around Brünnhilde's rock flares up in my breast. O woman, extinguish the blaze! Quiet its fiery rage! Not even the gods dared approach me! Heroes bowed low as I passed them. Chaste still, l left Valhalla. Let me grieve now in shame and disgrace. The man who awoke me has now wounded me. He has cut through my armor. I am Brünnhilde no more. In my eyes, you are dreaming still. Brünnhilde sleeps, not yet awake. Awaken now. Come, be my bride! My senses reel, my reason fails. Will all my wisdom vanish? And yet you said you were wise only through loving me. Woeful darkness dims my sight. My eyes seem blinded. Night falls around me. Out of the menacing gloom, fear rises in frenzy. Night covers the eyes you hide. Look at me and your fear will fade. Rise from the darkness, and see! The day blazes, bright with sunlight! Bright with sunlight is this day of my shame! Siegfried! See my distress. l existed always, and always shall l be... eternally yearning that you be blessed. O Siegfried, glorious hero, wealth of this world! Jubilant hero, light of the earth! Go! Leave me in peace. Do not approach me. Keep your wild passion from me. Do not destroy your beloved. Have you not felt a sudden joy, gazing at your image in a stream? But if you touch what you see, the reflection trembles and fades. Let me be as I am. Leave me still untouched. Like the stream, let me remain a joyously smiling reflection of you. Siegfried! Radiant youth! Find love, but let me be. Do not destroy half of your own being. If only you loved me! l could be more than myself, if you were mine. I see a glorious stream before me. I sense it with all my being. l will plunge into its waves, even if my reflection disappears. Let me drown myself in bliss! Let me quench my desire! Awaken, Brünnhilde! Waken to me! Live on, laughing, living in joy! Be mine! O Siegfried! l have always been yours. Then be mine now! Now and forever yours! You will always be mine! Look at me, breathe with me, our gazes, our lips, joined as one! My fear would vanish if Brünnhilde were truly mine. lf I were yours? My godly serenity is lost in the blaze of passion. lf I were yours? Siegfried, can you not see? If l gaze on you, are you not blinded? Can l embrace you and not set you afire? Can't you feel the fierce glow of my longing for you? Does this woman's wild passion not fill you with fear? Our blood is racing, our eyes blaze. But it only brings back my courage. As for fear, l never learned it. You had barely taught me to fear, and now l've forgotten it! O valiant child! Glorious hero! Unknowing source of marvels untold! Laughing, I love you blindly. Laughing, let us perish! Laughing, we'll greet our doom. Laughing, you awake to me, beloved! Farewell to Valhalla, dazzling domain! Farewell, O glorious gods! Proud immortals, expire in bliss! Let the rope of fate be cut! Let twilight fall on the gods! Now and always, you are my own, my all! Come, shining love! Come, jubilant death! Come, shining love! Come, jubilant death!
