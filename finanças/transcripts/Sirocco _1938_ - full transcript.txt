When Abu Talib opened his eyes under a purple silk canopy, on a bed of brocade and rich lace. Two black slaves were moving fans above his face... Leave those who have more to do than smoke work in peace! He was surrounded by unveiled women - who were singing with... - Your father disown you! That headache he gets - it's all your fault! Donkeys aren't the only ones that bray. I like Mattéo's voice. When I hear him, I'm like Abu Talib, I don't know whether I'm asleep or awake. At least I don't think any more of all the world's miseries. Here, smooth talker. And as much again when I know the rest. The Quran says: "The believer who makes good deeds will live in the gardens of paradise." How can the likes of you quote the Book? Am I not a Muslim, Zaid? It is written: "Let indulgence be thy share." if Allah wills. Do you recognize them? You gave them to me. I gave you a poem. Remember? "She has of the palm-tree the thin waist." All right, all right. Can you never stay silent? Here. A cake. I was keeping it for my lunch, but be off with you. Matteo, Matteo! Stop for a little while. I'll offer you an egg, a big egg. Hands full, silent mouth. Tomorrow, I'll be hungry too. Hungry enough for two eggs. As much a looter as the Southern nomads. What are two eggs to you, Mzab, if you learn how Queen Messaouda was changed into a viper. Hello, Mabul, son of Babu. Shoot! Sweet talking pays well these days. The funniest thing is that you believe more than they do. Who knows? And your princess? Are you still thinking about her? When is Mattéo's princess coming into this boilerhouse? Soon. You can shake it. It's strong. You must first develop muscles if you want to break in. Closed! Closed! For as long as you remain such a drop-out! Everyone fishes in their own way, father. Where did you get that from? Vlaos treated you? He and others. Many others. Fools! A word, an olive. A word, a date. You put hot air on the scales. No, I give them images that make them dream, laugh, forget. An idler's work. Me, a rope, a stone, a knife, and dive, Maltese. Don't you want to work? Does the bird in the tree work? The fish in water? Does the sunning lizard work? They're happy and free. Work is good only for those who have nothing to do. Me, I listen to the sea, to the wind, I stare at the sky. And I wait. It's terribly hot. My throat's so dry. One could drink all the time. The sun is too hot in your hole. One should live stark naked here. You see, a dress and panties are enough. No need for panties! It can come off, you know. Nothing frightens you! What should I be frightened of? I wonder. You caught a cold? No, it's the heat, the smoke. Not much clean air in that joint. Don't you think we could go somewhere else? Well... Well, what? You're only passing through, aren't you? Staying long? On your own? Not with you, anyway! You missed out! So, Greta, feeling all right? Not too well. If you see Safia, tell her that I went to bed. - I can't pay. - Another whisky on me. - This is the last one. - Your tab gets bigger. I do my best but you saw for yourself: it doesn't work. - I'll pay you tomorrow. - You say so every night. Poor kid. Her cough will do her in. What are you doing in my bed? Oh, Safia. I couldn't pay Rosina, she threw me out. What? She took the room key. Oh, I was so tired. Where am I supposed to sleep? On the sidewalk? I'm sorry, Safia. Here, I'll leave you your bed. You see, I didn't know where I could go. Let me stay here until tomorrow morning. Wait here. I'll have a word with the old goat and we'll see. I'll do the talking. Ready to bring about! All hands on deck. Ah Safia! What are you doing on board? The key! The key to Greta's room! Is that why you interrupted my sleep? Bruta bestia! I was dreaming about my husband. I was on board the San Gianni. My nice dream is gone! He would call me his little dove. I know what the rascal wanted. You'll go back to it. Give me Greta's key. You know she's penniless at the moment. No money, no key! I'd rather swallow it. No one's meaner than you. Swallow that key of yours and choke to death. No money, no key. Got it? Come on, back to bed. We'll see to it tomorrow. I'll manage somehow. Thank you, Safia. If it weren't for you... I don't get it. Rosina's not a bad woman. Ah, money... Why didn't he want me? He must have looked at my hands. They were probably shaking too. You're burning up. And I've got nothing here for a fever. No, I haven't got fever. There's nothing we can do. Nothing, ever. My hands are burning hot, that's all. When I was a kid, in my village, there was a creek. It ran through the meadows. At the bottom, you could see pink pebbles. I would put my hands in the water. It was cool, so cool. And it felt like the water was kissing me, softly, tenderly. Shut up, will you? So we can get to sleep. How good the sun feels on your skin! If only it was just the sun that pawed you! Why are you staying in the shade, Greta? To get used to Cadi street. There we never leave the cellar. If I could put a firecracker in your lollipop, it would shut your mouth. Come and help me. Her Ladyship need not use a big tub to wash her only shirt. One too many. What's a shirt for? For being taken off. When I was young I had fine clothes. You needed your tools of the trade. - In my village, in Westphalia... - In Westphalia, here we go again. While we washed clothes in a brick wash house, we sang. And afterwards we put them to dry on the green grass. From afar, it looked like snow. I can still smell the wet clothes. Safia, I'd love to see them again. - No chance, sweetie. - Leave her alone! There's too much sun here. It dries things up, turn them to dust. It made dust out of my bones. Right, there can't be many left under her skin. One fine morning, she'll drop where she stands. There won't be much to carry away. - Will you shut up, you old goat? - Why should I? On board the "San Gianni," when I would sail with my man, a sailor had the same look, the same voice. Three days later, food for the fish. "Mektub." My shirt! Give me that, you. You've never seen a woman's shirt, have you? My word, he's dumb! Thanks all the same. Ah, these, my boy, are the pomegranates of Allah's garden! - Hey, Safia. - Hello, Olga. Hello. You've done something wrong. - Not yet. Why? - He's here. I've seen him. He's following you. He's been doing it for a fortnight. He might be from the police. Him, a cop? No, you're mistaken. No, he's my guardian angel. He's busy as you can imagine. I didn't think your guardian angel would have such a funny face. We haven't seen Greta for some time. She took me for a ride. She's sick? The poor girl is very ill. Come on, champagne! I must do something to see her through this. My God. Hey... Have you got a light? Of course. Here! Try not to cough, I can't finish your mouth. That's it! No use outlining your eyes, the rings around them do the job. Some red on the tips of the ears. A little on your cheeks. You look less miserable now. But for the padding here, there's no way to cheat. You're really too thin! You look more like a minor. And that's what they like. Indeed! I'll tell the truth. We'll go to the police. What cheek! Why don't you stay in your country instead of insulting us in our home. I'm not insulting you or your country. But I had my wallet in that pocket. A wallet, barman, a wallet! And it isn't there anymore! And you rubbed against me a short while ago. You're kidding. What are you like? You'd need quite a lot of banknotes for me to rub against you. - Want to know? - Yeah. You can't pay for your champagne, so you say you were robbed. He wanted to get free Pommery! - I won't leave it at that. - What? You want the police? Well, I'll go get them myself. Come on. Bring this back to me later. Well, don't mind me. - So? - I found nothing. She may have hidden it. It's easy to hide a wallet after all. You're not accusing me, are you? We'll get you some other time. You can whistle for it. - All right, all right. Let's go! Sorry, dear madam, for this pointless visit. My respects! Good riddance, gentlemen. Good riddance. Did Greta tell you where she was going? Where would she go? You know where. What a waste of effort. "Of effort"? "Ma che"? Nothing, go to bed. Ah, it's you! Put it on the chest of drawers. Peace be with you. Allah is mighty and merciful. and he sees deep into hearts. He saw why I took this sin on me. I don't understand what you mean. What do you want? To keep the wallet to bring it to the police. I'll say that I've found it. Do what you want with it. Now, I don't care. - I didn't steal it for myself. - I knew it. - What? - You're incapable of evil. What a strange guy you are! But why do you follow me every day, even at night? Because where you are, the light shines. Because your footsteps, your voice are more than food to me. Well, you're happy with very little. I have everything. I had been waiting for my beautiful princess for such a long time, and she came. She's here. Oh, really, it's too much. Your princess is a whore. What you are to the others, I ignore. To me, you are what I've always dreamed you were. No man ever spoke to me with such words. What do you do to be so... I tell stories in the port, in the suks. Beautiful stories. - That's not a job. - No. But it's the way I live, and help others to live. Getting the hang of the job? Or the sweat of it. To think that you could be drinking ice coffee, talking instead having your head boiling under that scorching sun. I really don't understand. Pay day. Go get it. Wait for your turn. First or last in, you won't get more. - Slowly. - Hakim. Hakim. - Matteo. - Matteo. Here. - Chachur. - It's me. - Chachur. - Right. Here. Safia. Here you are again. For you. Well, I never. A present? It smells nice. You're hurt. Were you fighting? No, but I unloaded the ship. My hands are not used to it. No, but I unloaded the ship. My hands are not used to it. It must be washed at once, my poor little thing. It must be washed at once, my poor little thing. Take those rags off. Hold this. Be careful. Why did you put your dress on? You're not going back there? I put it on for Matteo. I knew he'd be back. Yet, he left this morning without saying good bye. I didn't want to wake you. You were so beautiful, asleep in your hair, your mouth half open and your eyelids down. All day, I thought of your eyelids, which were like mysterious doors opening onto fresh gardens, filled with silence. Safia! Safia! Are you coming today or by Christmas? Are you coming or not? You tell me nice things, you do. You look exhausted. Hard work, the docks. And we didn't get much sleep last night, did we? The two of us. You will never leave me. I'll take you away. We'll go to the Maltese House, my father's house, near the desert. You know, my father Babu, the sponge diver. He lives there. When the Southern wind blows, the whole house sings. At night, I'll come back from town, after work. You'll be waiting for me. And from a distance, you'll be like a big bunch of flowers, on the sand. It smells good. What are you making? The "pescadiere," fish soup. On board the "San Gianni" the men scarfed it down. No doubt. Could you... - You want a taste? - No, not for me. Could you keep some for... - For your guy. - Yes. Which rock did you find that winkle under, Safia? If you start soliciting in the docks, I tell you, One of these days, a knife in your guts. Safia! Safia! Come, quick! Greta is about to croak. - Where? - In Cadi Street. At number five, yes. She needs to go to the hospital. But the owner won't let her go. She owes her 300 francs. - I've got 150. And you? - I could only get 100. It's not enough. She won't let her go. Get an ambulance. I'll take care of it. Listen, Rosina. We can't let her die like this. Don't you see, in a place like that? I always said she'd go to Cadi Street. She went there but, well, who knows if she'll stay. Here, the rest. Thanks. You'll get it back. Come on, make way! Come on, get back, ladies. - That's what awaits us. - Not all of us. We're tough. What's taking Greta is her disease, not men. Oh, come on, leave us be. Speaking of men, some are coming in tonight. Rich people sailing around the world. They'll surely go to "L'escale". Are you coming there with me? No. There's too much garlic. Don't worry, I won't mind. What news? She won't last long. "Mektub". I'd forgotten. I'll serve soup to your... No, no. Don't. "Ma come?" Aren't you working tonight? Hey, the show's over here. Here. Have a drink. Did I sleep long? I was so tired. Here, eat your soup. Work makes you hungry. Tell me, Matteo. Is the Maltese House far from here? O, Sea, carry me to my beloved one. And the sea wrapped him in a big wave which brought the pink pearl near to the white pearl. and the two pearls reunited became so bright that they illuminated the bottom of the waters. - It's a pretty story. - I made it up just for you. - And it ends well. - You'll tell it to our children. You're dreaming again. What would you feed our children with? I'll earn money, lots of money. I can become foreman. You are the child. I don't want to mislead a child. Listen, Matteo. When I followed you, I didn't love you. But don't say a word. Don't be frightened. Listen. My life was so awful that I couldn't stand it anymore. I needed to catch my breath, or else... Do you understand? Then, slowly, one day after another, I felt that I loved you for good. - What wind! - It's the sirocco. It feels like the house is surrounded by wild beasts wanting to come in. - Lucky I'm not alone. I'd be frightened. - You'll never be alone. "The links of love are lighter than virgins' hair "but they strap down a man's heart more cruelly than heavy chains "and even death cannot always break them down." The poor child hasn't got much longer to live. - Don't wake her up. It'd tire her out. - Oh, you know, now... You might be bringing her her last pleasure. You have a visitor. Your friend, miss Safia. Thank you, sister. They smell so nice, Safia. You're so kind. - How are you feeling? - Much better, I'm feeling much better. I can feel my strength coming back. I think I'll be out of here very soon. If only I could go back home, I think I'd recover. Why wouldn't you? You know, I so much want to see fir-trees, clouds, rain. But of course, you'll see it all again. What about you? Still the good life? The big love's still holding on? Who would have thought it? What? It's over with Matteo? What's wrong with you? You look strange. What's wrong with me? Thinking that this is happening to me and right now. Nice mess! What? It's serious? Can't you guess? Really? A child? It's wonderful, Safia. You're happy, aren't you? Yes. And that's what surprises me, I'm happy. - What must I do? - What do you mean? Yes. Should I tell Matteo or should I... ? Are you crazy? Keep the child. - Easy to say. - If only I'd had one... Listen! Matteo loves you, doesn't he? He'll do anything when he knows. He'll get down from the moon to take care of you and the child. And you'll see, when I feel better, I'll knit baby clothes. Go tell Matteo now but do it quick. Why don't you come on the cargo ship with us? Weapons smuggling? No. You're wrong. It's 1000 each. I don't need money. I earn some each day. You won't buy her silk stockings on your pay. She wears no stockings. Such a shame to hear this! What's with you, Safia? You're not ill, are you? - Greta? - No, I've just seen you working, I didn't know it was so hard. - And you can cope? - One can get used to it. Here! Look at my arms. Fine, eh? It's so good. Seems so. Make the most of it. Soon, you'll have to tighten your belt. Really? Why? You remember your story of the pink pearl and the white pearl that you said you'd tell our children in the future. Yes. Well, you'll be able to, soon. A child? Safia, you're carrying my child? - Be blessed. - Like you say. Let every being in heavens and on earth praise the Eternal one. It will work out all right. I've been offered a deal. - You? A deal? - Diving for sponges in the Jerba area. Five days at sea and I'll get 1000 francs. 1000? To go diving for sponges. You're dreaming! Don't worry and don't tire yourself. I'll get rich for both of you. Wait for me. For what you offered me, it's not too late? You've made up your mind, at last. We're getting on board at 6. And keep your mouth shut. All right. I'll be there. Hurry up! We're moving! It was in the month of May. Do you remember, sweetie? That we had met on the night of the 4th of April. You had big green eyes That felt like anisette And your tits of mousse that looked so fragile. Well, good whore of my heart. So you're back. - Hello, Rosina. Hello! - Hello. - Miss Irma, who took your old room. Well, beauty, what's new? The vacation is over? Matteo? No, I haven't left him. But he left to go sponge diving for 5 days and he's been away for 8. You'll never see him again. How naive she can be! So, your Arab left you. Farewell! Good riddance! You didn't think it'd last for all your life, did you? He may have been sponge diving but he's left you on the sand for good. I'm not asking you to feel sorry for me, but I'm penniless and the old guy won't give me anything. Lend me some money, Rosina. You always got it back. Money? "Benissimo." Greta's room is free, go get your things and you'll have an advance on your work. No? You've gone straight? Well, go find food somewhere else. What are you coming here for? You know that Mattéo's gone. You Satanic beast! He went away because of you. For you, he became a gun smuggler. A smuggler? And you pretend you don't know. Will you go, you bitch? Babu's son has disgraced himself because of you. And now, he is dead. Matteo, dead and unburied, eaten by the sharks. Go away, you rotten woman. I need no one. Lucky we'll be there shortly. Be where? You don't even know where we are. I trust Jules's intuition. If he says we'll be in Sfax tonight, we shall. Goddammit! What is it? A woman, boss. - Wounded? - I only just steered clear of her. Let's carry her into the car. Where was she coming from at this late hour? Drink some spirits. It'll warm you up. Can you speak? What happened to you? I got lost. You live around here? Shall we drive you home? Well, actually, I can't go back. My uncle and I, we had a quarrel. I see. So where do you want me to... I don't know. If we don't board the "Carthage" tonight, we'll have to wait one week. The boss doesn't seem to be in a hurry. Yes. Says the man only interested in 3000-year-old women! You believe that uncle story? Uncle or no uncle, we should have left four days ago. - What about going and telling him? - "Go." Mr. Chervin? What is it? Does Miss Safia need something? Not her, boss. Us. We'd like to know if we're leaving today. Yes, of course. Well, I mean... theoretically. - The "Carthage" sails at 4. - That woman is lovely. The trailer is hooked up. Shall we load it? Yes, in a moment. Excuse me. I've come to say my goodbyes. Your good byes? So, you feel better? Quite well. Thanks to you. - I don't know how to thank you. - Don't mention it. Everyone was so nice to me. I felt so well here. A real vacation. - I could have stayed longer. - Well, but... Mr. Chervin. Can I start it? Yes, yes, do. I am... I am worried about letting you go, Miss Safia. Yes, I... I fear for you. - What will you do? - Don't worry. Really, I'm worried. Promise me, at least, never to walk at night, alone, in the desert, with an empty stomach. With an empty stomach, like you say. - I'm coming for the trunk, boss. - Take it. I'll manage somehow. - I'll go back to my uncle. - The uncle again. Excuse me. - You have no need for the bed? - No, take it. - You'll have fine weather for your trip. - I hope so. You don't know Paris? - No. - You don't know what you're missing. There's no better place. I'm sure you'd like it. Come on, off you go! There's nothing more I can do for you? You go to the port with your trucks? You could drop me at the hospital. A friend of mine is very sick. Yes, all right. - You're not from Sfax? - From Marseilles. I see. Allow me to be indiscreet one last time. Why are you staying here? You have connections here? A family, an occupation? - Or someone? - No, nothing. No one. Not any more. Will you come to Paris with me? - Sorry? - I... I've come for the box, boss. Well, we're being expelled. Come on, hurry. For these last four days, I've got used to your presence near me, to your youth. I will miss it very much. I'd like to keep you near me. Impossible? Impossible. - We're ready, boss. - All right, let's go. Think it over, my little Safia. The ship leaves at 6. I'll stay at the gangway until the last moment. I'll wait until I see a beautiful young lady who would bring with her great joy. Do not wait, Mr. Chervin. The young lady won't come. She's told you: impossible. Goodbye, Safia. Thanks to all of you. Say hello to Paris. - Good bye, Miss Safia. - Goodbye, Miss Safia, good luck. What if Matteo comes back? Go, Safia, go. Get away from Sfax. It's a chance, don't you get it? It's your chance. And afterwards, it's all over. Over. Even if Matteo comes back. You know what's holding me back. Your child? What will become of it? Especially if you stay. If it's a girl, she'll be like you, Like me. Look at me, Safia. Look at your daughter in 25 years. Listen, leave with this man. Go, let him love you. Make him believe that the child is his. - You're crazy, Greta. Do you realize what you're saying? You must lie, Safia. You must lie to save the child. Because, listen carefully, once, a long time ago, I told the truth to a man. And you see where I ended up: I'm dying for it. Later, you'll see your little girl happy. She'll have fine, quiet eyes. She'll be sweet and merry. And you'll listen to her laughing. Laughing. Yes, and playing in a lace gown, in nice gardens with flowers and water jets, like in Mattéo's dreams. It's only a dream. Impossible, my poor Greta. Safia! Safia! Matteo! Matteo! Father, I'll tell you later. Where's Safia? The sharks didn't eat you? - Where's Safia? - Alive! Your arm! You're wounded. Show me! Let go of me. Safia! Safia! Safia? Safia! Safia! Safia! Matteo, don't be afraid. I'll say you didn't smuggle guns. - I'll defend you before the judge. - Where is Safia? Gone, Safia. Bad girl. Speak of her no more. - What are you talking about? - Gone, gone! Babu's son is back. - Gone where? - Back to town. - Listen, Matteo, old Ibrahim... - You drove her away! It's the best cabin available. - Thank you. Here! - Thank you, sir. Regrets, already? Go and rest, Safia. Come on. Let me in. I must talk to her. I want to know where Safia is. It's too late, my friend. The poor girl has just died. And Miss Safia was there. - Safia was there? When did she leave? - About fifteen minutes ago. - Do you know where she went? - No. I saw her go towards the port. The port? Thank you. Leave me alone! Safia! Safia! Safia! A somewhat formal grace reveals its Egyptian influence. Quite unquestionable. In the Luxor museum, I've seen figurines from the Third Dynasty - with things in common with this one. - The great style. I brought it back from my trip to Africa three years ago. I found it near Ghadames. Always the same. Transfixed before a naked woman. Watch out for your blood pressure, my old friend. Dear host, aren't we going to see Mrs. Chervin? She's gone shopping. She should be back soon. Pretty women always have urgent shopping to do. - That's what they tell their husbands. - And their husbands believe them. Naturally, she must have many suitors. Oh, naturally. I must say that she is charming, absolutely charming. In her - how to put it? - bird of paradise sort of way. But it has its charm! Ah, look! Here she is! My very good dear friend. I'm delighted to see you. I'm sorry I'm late. The car broke down. I was just telling your husband how fine I think you are. You managed to convince him? My dear, I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you. I read your article in "The Ethnological Review" yesterday. - How fortunate for me! - Remarkable, really remarkable. Good evening. Hello. Hello, Laurent. - We don't see you often. - Thank you for noticing. Oh, dear Mrs. Devere, your dress is so stylish. Homemade. I can't afford the couturiers. It has the merit of its originality. Your merit. I heard the good news. I hope we'll meet your fiancé soon. With pleasure, Madame. - My highest respects, Mrs. Chervin. - Hello. Improving, the wild girl. She's adapting. Apparently he got her in the suks. - Much worse. - In any case, she's a good hostess. She's used to society. "My very dear good friend." That old crone, with her patronizing ways, makes me mad. - "She makes me angry". - If you will, but it's not as strong. Don't worry about what those people think. And the car breaking down, that wasn't true, was it? - No, it wasn't. - Where were you then? At the Sorbonne. At the Sorbonne? Yes, for two weeks, I've been going to the open courses. My little child playing at being a student! Secretive, aren't you? - What courses? Can I know? - You'll laugh! The positive philosophy of Auguste Comte. You're not afraid of anything. I didn't know what it was. I don't doubt it. But why? Do you think I want a scholar for a wife? I love you like you are, darling. I realize how much I don't know. - I don't want to shame you. - You? I'm envied above all. You can be sure of it. That's it, Paname! We're there, raghead. Come and have a look. Here, Montmartre. The Sacré Coeur. And the Eiffel Tower. - It's lit up for our return. - Safia is in Paris. You've bent my ears for three years about that. I didn't say anything because we were in jail but it's over! But consider: in Paname, there are many Safias, and more beautiful ones. There is no other Safia. I'd asked her to wait for me. Eight days only and it's been three years now. Matteo should not have been into weapons smuggling. Matteo should have gone on telling his little stories and he wouldn't have lost his Safia. Come on, don't make such a face. I want you to make a good impression on my friends. Salam! At ease. Hello, boss. So you're back. Who's this guy? Have you forgotten that I don't like new faces? He's my fetish, Matteo. A guy who's taken a three-year cruise with me, on the same ship. I might even say in the same cabin. Hey, raghead! That trip was good for you, wasn't it? You had time to think. Aren't you tired of being your own boss? - Seeing what I got from it. - Good. Got it? Have your place back and never leave it. All right, boss. Now, I can recommend this guy. Somewhat crazy, because of a broad, but really on the level. Aren't you, Raghead? Antonin! - You don't look so bad. - I'm thinner. Beans make you bloated but you don't thrive on them. Antonin, give the guy some clothes. He'll sleep here. Business is good. We can afford to pay a bellboy to keep the goods dusted. Thank you very much, gentlemen. You'll let me see how beautiful you are, dressed as a bourgeois. Too small. Listen to my advice, sleep near the heating. It's the best place. I'll put you out a straw mattress. There's no lack of furs to cover yourself with. Too big. But you must be careful with them. The gentlemen here are very touchy. I think I've found what we need. Fine fabric, latest trend. Say, you'll have coffee with me in the morning. We'll be good friends. But what are you called? "Raghead" is not a name. But it's not my name. Antonin Robillard. Matteo, from Sfax. Indeed. Always the same thing. You think your Safia will appear at the corner. You'll wear your eyes out, looking at all the women coming by. Or, one day, you'll get slapped. Mine would be three now. Like this one. The kid. Safia. Safia. The kid. Change the record. I won't introduce you, you're too shabby. Smoke that cigarette while you wait. I'll talk to her. - Hello, Suzanne. - You look real smart, Ernest. It's to please you. Be careful. The brat won't report it to your mistress. He is nice. Tickle, tickle. One day, a sponge diver found in the same shellfish two wonderful pearls, a pink one and a white one. He left the white pearl at the bottom of the sea and offered the pink pearl to the lady sultan of Kwach Gara who, to thank him for his present, appointed him as her Grand Vizier. But the pink pearl away from the white pearl was losing its sparkle, and the Lady Sultan was very sorry You little devil, can't you stay where you're told to? As she made a boat ride one night, she heard the pink pearl saying: "O Sea, carry me near to my beloved." And the sea wrapped it in a big wave which carried the pink pearl back to the white pearl. And both of them together again sparkled so much that they illuminated the bottom of the sea. He offered the pink pearl to the Lady Sultan of... of... Kwatch. I forgot the name. To thank him, she made him Grand Vizier. But the pink pearl was losing its color because it was very sad. It's a pretty story. Who told it to you, darling? A man on a bench. A man in the Parc Monceau. But I took our little girl away immediately. The man was. . . What is she saying? She says she took our daughter away immediately. - The man was some sort of... - A tramp! A tramp. You will never take our daughter to the Parc Monceau. Never! Her mother is scared to have her daughter taken away. Aren't you, darling? Hey, Raghead, come here quick! Good news, old man. Can't you guess? Brace yourself. Don't drop the bottles. Your broad is here...That takes the wind out of your sails, doesn't it? Hurry, she's waiting. Congratulations, man. She's a really beautiful girl. Finding her for you was quite hard. We wanted to surprise you. She wanted to see where you slept. - We showed her your hovel. - We're like brothers to you. Hurry up, dammit! She's getting impatient. Well? Kiss your woman, why don't you? Travadja la mouquere, travadja bono Stop it! Stop it, you bastards! - What? - Bastards! That's the word for you. I don't want you to hurt my raghead. Yeah! They're laughing at you because they think a man like you mustn't cry over a woman who left him in such a way. But women... they're all the same. And it doesn't matter more than this dummy. But you must work with us. You'll get to be someone. Yes, you... You'll be able to buy suits like this one, smoke fancy cigars and treat yourself to trips to Deauville. Believe me, in life, only this matters. - What do you want, madam? - Information. Your name, please. Agency manager Rossignol. Quite so, madam. Intimate information before marriage, unfaithfulness, Quite so, madam. Intimate information before marriage, unfaithfulness, health, morality, investigation on letters, health, morality, investigation on letters, surveillance in spa towns, divorce, tailing, protection against blackmail. Miss Germaine Dartois? Please sit down. What's all this about? A confessor is listening to you. Well. I learnt by chance that a friend of my brother is in Paris in a very delicate situation. And I'd like to help him. Touching solicitude, which you deserve credit for. You're taking notes, Miss Diana? And what are the first and last names of this interesting young man? Because I suppose he is a young man. - Matteo Gordina. - Matteo Gordina. - Very musical. Where does he live? - I don't know. - How long has he been in Paris? - I don't know. And where did he come from? I thought that... I've got it. We'll figure out everything else. What about the price? Your affair excites my esteem and my sympathy. I'll reduce the usual rate for you. Give me only 500 francs in advance. Here you are. And twice as much at the end. - When can I phone? - In a week. - May I know who told you about us? - I saw your ad in "Le Figaro". Very good newspaper. My respects, Miss. Aren't you moved by this brotherly devotion? Poor girl. Did you take note of it all? I have noted that your poor girl wears a grey outfit, a hat by Rosie Ann, and that her name is not Germaine Dartois. Because her initials are S. C. A good private eye! And where did you see that? Easy: on her handbag. Men never notice anything. But women do not think of everything. S.C. A lie? How naughty! Roger? The lady going out: name, address, status. Hurry up! And don't lose her on the way. Hey, Raghead! A light. Mr. Matteo. A "pneumatique" has just been delivered for you. - Good news? - It must be another practical joke. A joke? If it were true though. Antonin, you don't have clothes that are a little more... well, smarter? A date with your girlfriend. You want to look like a regular dandy. Old Antonin understands young people. Unbelievable and yet true. Mrs Andre Chervin, legal wife of the renowned scientist, distinguished collector and wealthy bourgeois, three persons in one, has a secret affair with the worst bum. Very interesting. Sometimes, the most intelligent men lose the game when their heart blurs their view. Don't worry, dear partner, I know when to turn the 9. I know, my dear friend, that chance is often on your side but don't rely too much on it. Excuse me, boss. Emergency. Whatever the emergency, take off your hat, there's a lady here. I'm listening. Good. The bill! Here. Have a drink on me. - And even two. - Thank you, boss. More and more interesting. And now, may I know where we're off to? Rossignol is a man of his word, at least until it changes. I'll offer you a show which, I hope, won't disappoint you. Come in. Ah, it's you, Matteo. Good evening. Come in, shut the door. You were looking for me? Here I am. What a beautiful get-up! You've become somebody. You got yourself a good job? Well, that's all you have to say to me? Why did you leave, Safia? Now, really, that's the best one yet. What cheek! You're suffering memory loss? Weren't you the one who left to go sponge diving and never came back? I came back too late. Why did you doubt me? Was I supposed to hang around there forever, waiting for you? Let's not talk about that. Sit down, make yourself comfortable. Smart joint, eh? Ah, you know, Safia still has her share of success. Is that the show you told me about? - I didn't have to dress up! - Hush. Act I: The honorable Mrs. Chervin's amorous past. It isn't possible, Safia. You cannot have forgotten. What about our child? You really thought that a girl like me... You're even more naive than I thought, then. Safia, a child. Do you know what you're saying? A son like you, a daughter like me? A fine present indeed. No, the brat is gone. In no time! Fiat Lux agency has good reason to think that the heiress feels fine. All right. If you made the trip from Sfax for the kid... it was for him, wasn't it? Well, you can go back to your backwater with my blessing. Our child. Well, you know, romance is not enough. Faithfulness, fine feelings, love, and all that are all very nice but you need food first. Money is important. You don't seem to realize it. You're there, dreaming. Money is the only important thing nowadays. You're right. Life is not a dream. I'm a poor fool. Don't worry. You won't see me again. You're here at last. Where were you? I told you I'd be coming back late from the Delaquis's. - Do you know what time it is? - No, not exactly. That bridge game lasted much longer than I thought and... - You're lying. Why are you lying? - But I... I what? I phoned. You left there at 10 o'clock. And since then? Since then? Not now. I beg you, don't torment me. I can't take it any more. Why? Look at me. What's with your eyes? You've been crying! What's going on? You've been crying or else... Or else. Who were you with? - Who with? - No! - Answer me! - Leave me alone. - Answer me! - Leave me alone. Fill my glass, Raghead. Didn't you hear me? I don't want to be called Raghead. My name is Matteo. I said "Raghead", I say "Raghead" again. And fill that glass, damnit! Cheers, my friend. I was brutal to you. Please, forgive me. I was worried because you were late. I feared that you'd had an accident. You see, to me, you're still a child somehow. And tonight I missed you even more than usual, so I was waiting, getting nervous. I'll wait until you love me enough not to hide anything from me. Good night, my child. The Count of Tourettes, Chairman of the Association for the Protection of Stray Children. Monsieur wishes to speak to Monsieur or to Madame? To Mrs. Chervin in person. Please go into the sitting-room. I'll give Madame your card. Count des Tourettes? But I'm making no mistake, Miss Germaine Dartois? What do you want, Mr. Rossignol? Mrs. Chervin! You are Mrs Chervin? Dartois was a false name. I'm confounded. - And that name of yours? - Simple tact. It would have seemed unbecoming to come to Mr. Chervin's wife's as a private detective. My social status adapts itself to the people whom I see. Caution and transformation. But may I sit down? I'm still stunned. I really didn't expect that coincidence. Ah, madam. - A regrettable deception. - Enough sweet-talk. I'm listening. Sweet talk! I wish it were. Alas, I'm only carrying the sad truth. - I expect every lie. - Then I would have been lied to. Yet, he's told me the tragedy of his life. Touched by so acute a distress, I took charge of his cause I gave him all the necessary details. About what? Whom? A woman he'd known once before. In Sfax. I can see that you know of the place. You mean blackmail. Emotion leads you astray, madam. I didn't hear you. Delightful child. Your daughter, is she not? She has her mother's beautiful eyes and looks like her father. She's three, is she not? Don't touch it! Conclusions? "Romance is not enough. "Faithfulness, love, it's all very nice. "but getting food comes first. "A child? Fine present indeed." That's what you feel, is it not? - He's told you. - He did. Your loose woman disguise, your useless playacting I can guess the motives. What tragedy if the shadow of the past darkened the bright present. - If it were only this. - I forgot the child. The heroic masquerade was for the child and I almost made it fail. Believe me, I'll do my best to fix things. No, I'll take care of him myself. God forbid! Don't try to see him. He's moved by his hot blood and it could drive him to regrettable extremes. Let him try! I tried to reason with him, I proved to him, being Doctor of Law, that this was in fact illegal. Come on, let's end it. He wanted to tell your husband. I can't help shivering when I think of what would happen afterwards. - You're a horrible man. - A man of experience. Believe me, madam, keep that bad dream away by making Matteo go away. But what can I do? - 50,000 francs will be enough. - Is that what he asks? It's the sum thanks to which I will do what it takes to make him forget the past. I haven't got any money. Take this jewel, it's worth three times that. I'm a philanthropist, I'm not a jeweler. I'll wait until you get money for it. I prefer banknotes. If need be, I'll give poor Matteo an advance. Trust and credit are the foundations of trade. The Count of Tourettes, who came for charity. Delighted to meet you in person because your reputation is known, Sir. Mrs Chervin was kind enough to show interest in our work for the protection of children, the social character of which touched her. Mrs Chervin is free to sponsor what charity she likes. In two or three days, then, madam? The sooner the better. Forgive me for such an imperious phrase but we have pressing needs. My respects, Madam. I thank you in advance. I need not remind you of the address. Madame. Monsieur. Off the rails! Last stop! - It's broken. - No, there! - Time for a walk, madame. - All right, take her. Good bye, my love. - Tell me, darling. - Ah! - Good news. - Yes? Good. - About your pendant. - My pendant? Well? You know it was insured. The insurance paid. They investigated and they found it. Say, you don't look pleased. Oh, come on! So it was found. Someone probably found it. A woman sold it to a jeweler. Not for much, of course. The jewel is at the police station, as is the jeweler. And you must come with me. Right now? But... - I can't go with you. - You don't want to come with me? Yes, only I was waiting for someone. You understand. I had things to do. You could go without me. It would be much simpler. Besides, you know that pendant as well as I do. So you are the woman who sold this jewel? What did you need money for? - Why? - Enough lies! Is it you or not? Yes, it's me. Why? I can't tell you. Safia, it's very serious. I've overlooked many things, I've respected your secrets, but today, I want to know the truth. For the last time, tell me what you sold this jewel for! Or for whom? No, I can't say. I will say nothing. Then it is impossible for you to go on living in this house with me. You will leave right now. You'll go... where you want. From now we'll live apart. Of course, the child stays with me. - Andre, it's not fair! - You'll see her from time to time. Lawyers will settle things in every detail. They'll take care of our divorce. The room is still available for you, Miss Safia. But I didn't think you'd ever be back. Neither did I. Oh, you're sad, poor darling. It's because you're lonely. Being lonely is very bad. I feel well only when we're two. Or three. I want to know why he hasn't got a woman. Easy. He's hiding her. He doesn't want her to be taken away from him. - Shut up, ladies. The boss does as he wants. Invite her. She'll be pleased. Why not? Why not? Hello, princess. We came to get you to have fun. Come on. Come on, get up quickly. - So you didn't leave. - As you can see. Get dressed, we're taking you out. Tonight you can get drunk. I'm buying the drinks. You like my suit, don't you? Suits me better than the gandura. We never say no to anything any more! Nothing can stop the party! Get out! I may be wrong but I feel we're not wanted. - Salam. - All right! I hope we'll meet again. Come on, let it go. You too, I told you I've had enough of you. Drunkard! Cheap poet! What more do you want? You didn't do me enough harm? Isn't it enough that you made me lose it all, my husband, my child. That's not enough revenge? Go and tell him that the child is not his but yours. What are you waiting for? Go! Our child? Our child is alive? - Enough! - That domestic quarrel is endless. Sparks must be flying, up there. No, don't go. I was only joking. A child? You must be joking. Listen, I'll get dressed. We'll go out with your friends and have fun. Okay? Matteo, Matteo, don't go there! Look for Andre Chervin's address in the phone book. What's this guy done to you now? Let me out. Get out! You're ditching us here on the sidewalk? I told you to get out. - We'll go by bus. - No. Let's go. Don't do anything silly. - Come on, where is he? - But I... Don't make trouble, answer. In his office, over there. Watch him, wait for me. You're Andre Chervin, aren't you? Yes. Sit down. I must talk to you. Strange way to start a conversation. I've come to talk to you about Safia. - Well, help yourself. - But, Sir... I'm telling you to. You're a gang leader, a blackmailer and you want me to believe you? The man you took Safia from was neither a gangster then nor a blackmailer, like you say. It's that man I once was who's asking you to believe him. I wanted to make her pay for leaving me. I terrorized your wife. She was scared to lose you if you learnt that I was... Did she love you? No. I know now that I was nothing to her since she followed you and stayed with you. She loves you, that's the truth. And she's had your child. A boy or a girl? A little girl who's three. Her name's Jacqueline. Jacqueline. Little Jacqueline thanks you. Well, boss? Did you settle your business with Chervin? No. I dealt with mine. The boss was wrong. The raghead was right. I may be dumb but I don't get it. Where shall we go? Find the gang? We're going to Antonin's. Antonin's? I've forgotten something there. Good evening, gentlemen. But I hope you're not coming here to stay? Don't worry, old man, it's Matteo. He's forgotten something here. He's getting it, then we're clearing off. Matteo! Hurry up, I'm starving. You can go. I won't need you any more today. What's wrong with him? He didn't even say "hello." Yet I've lent him fine suits. You've found it, Matte'o? The guys are waiting. You can tell them I'm gone. I'm going back to Sfax. What's wrong with him? Pay no attention. Things aren't going well. He has problems with his broad. Prepare a coffee and get a bottle of brandy. You remember how much he likes that. I'll get some grub. Hey, Matteo. I meant to tell you that since I've seen your Safia, well, you were right: she's sure not like other women. May Allah forgive his servant, and spare him the eternal sufferings. Allah's mercy is infinite. Matteo, you can come up. I have a little surprise for you. Raghead! Raghead. . . What now? You're ditching me? I'm going back to House of the Maltese. Salam. Salam.
