MARCH ON ROME "The 4th of November, 1918." "After four years of War..." "... Italy takes its seat victoriously at the table of peace..." "... beside its sister nations." "She has finally begun an age of well-being..." "... of order and of work for all." "Well, perhaps not for all..." MILAN 1919 It's a disgrace that you still see things like this around... - A spare cigarette, by any chance? - No, get out of here! Yes, I'd put all the Bolsheviks up against the wall, that's what I'd do! - Lieutenant, good day. Do you remember me? - I don't believe so. Sorry, but weren't you in the third Alpine battalion? - The marines! - Exactly, the marines! Then they transferred me to the landing party battalion! I remember you very well, Sir. - You were at... where was it? At... - Ancona. Ancona! Of course! I also remember the commandant, a real hunk of a man! I was, if you remember, wounded in the landing operation. For which I got a silver medal for bravery. I'm not trying to be boastful... And then, Sir, three months of military hospital in Monfalcone. The food was terrible in that hospital, just look at what I've become! 87 kilos! 87 kilos, Sir! I'm not asking for me, you know, I see you're in grieving... But I have my mother in Rome, Sir, a widow and all alone... ... the poor old thing, I haven't seen her for 5 years! Besides, who's going to give me money? What can I do? Pay with the medal? - Here! - Thank you, Sir! Long live Italy! Damn, what a cheapskate! - Hey, give me a small bag of chestnuts! - I don't sell chestnuts. - What do you sell, then? - Nothing. Then why are you down there? - Well! - Sorry, what was that? - I'm down here because I'm tired! Got a problem with that? Good day, Lieutenant! - You again? This is the third time! - You should be ashamed of yourself! Alright, alright! Good day, Lieutenant! Do you remember me? Of course! You're Domenico Rocchetti... ... second battalion, third company. I'm Captain Paolinelli. Ah, but... you've really changed. You didn't have the beard before! And you haven't changed a bit, still the same old slacker! You want to play games with me, but I won't fall for it! - What games? - And what's this supposed to be? Ah, the medal! No, it's nothing... - When did you earn that medal? - It's just a joke, Sir... It's just... you know, for... What are you doing? You're not allowed to hit me! Damn, what a slap! You're crazy... - Hold on. What are you doing in Milan? - Nothing. What do you think I'm doing? Nothing! But you shouldn't hit people, Sir! "Slacker", he says. I might be a slacker, but... ... 4 years of war, 3 on the front line. I've done my time. Yes, yes. Take that medal off! And hurry up about it! Alright, alright... "Slacker", "slacker", he says... But if I was a slacker like you say, I wouldn't be walking around... ... with holes in my gloves, or shoes in this kind of condition! Right now I'd be like the rest of those guys out there... ... who sacrificed themselves but are now screwed, eating, drinking, smoking... ... in the faces of everyone who fought for this country. I know, I know, you're right! But now there are some men, true Italians, true patriots... ... who have united in a national movement to put a stop to that kind of thing! - Oh, really? I had no idea. - Yes, yes. No, I mean I don't follow politics. I'd like to, but I don't have the means. Do you know where I sleep, Sir? Do you know what a sergeant major said to me yesterday at the garrison? He said: "Get off your ass and work!" The medal, you say? If I didn't have the medal, he would have probably spat at me! - Have you eaten, Rocchetti? - No, of course I haven't eaten! Actually, if we want to be precise, Domenico Rocchetti hasn't eaten in 3 days! No, heaven forbid! Let me pay for it. - Thank you. - Here you go, my good man! Here! Let me take care of it, Sir. - Attorney! - Captain, I'm writing your speech! Please, you choose! I couldn't possibly... PROGRAMME OF FASCISM I thought it was the menu! It's the programme for our movement. Approved by the Fascist Foundation on the 23rd of March. It's a menu where the food will stay on your stomach a while, I assure you! Well, I'm sure it is! "Proclamation of the Italian Republic". What can I get you, Sir? Today we have a nice veal stew! Yes! The stew would be fine for me! With some greens beans. Allow me to introduce you: Domenico Rocchetti. And a few potatoes in oil, okay? - This is Comrade Gioacchino. - He's a comrade, too? Well, I'm not sure yet. I still need to have a little look at the programme here! Let's say not quite yet! So he'll pay? Oh, no? - And what can I get you, Sir? - A risotto. - A nice risotto? Here, I'll take a risotto as well. You know, for seconds! Hell, no one pays around here! "Sovereignty of the Population" A real proletarian programme, robust... - Robust, above all is he who guides us! - Of course! Captain, I need your opinion on this. Considering the complexity of the argument, and also the exemplification of vocabulary... ... I have come to the conclusion that it would be better to write an allocation... - Sorry, but what is this about? - Your speech for tomorrow! Ah yes, of course! Are you coming with us? Of course! Where? - The election rally. - Of course I will! - Tomorrow we shall thrust our programme... - Sorry... - What are you doing? - Numbering the pages. - Anyway, as I was saying, tomorrow... - Yes... ... we shall thrust our programme into the faces and hearts of thousands... ... of labourers and farmers. "A working day of eight hours." Very good for your health. Very good, that programme... Sir, that traitor comrade of yours gave me nothing but bone! Not only will victory be ours... ... but also the very same homeland... ... magnificent and painful... ... that looks up at us, begging... ... eyes brimming with tears... - Will you be deaf to her suffering?! - Good voice! In short, do you not have... ... the desire to call yours... ... this sweat-sprinkled land? - What is this? It's nothing but questions! - What do you mean?! You should have known, no one is going to answer them here. Let me explain! Instead of a simple monologue... ... I wanted to make it interrogative... - Alright, alright! Hey, Captain! Shall I go and answer? This is a village of filthy subversives! They need punches, not words! We must lead with our fists! - This is an election campaign! - Who cares?! We must attain power through the vote, not through violence! I'll show them! - Marcazzi! - Yes, Sir! You're out of line... That's enough! Let's get out of here! - Are we leaving already, Sir? - Yes, yes, yes... - Alright, pack it away and load it up! - Yes, Sir! - And be quick about it! Everything on the cart! - Hurry up! - Quick, get moving! Idiots! Come on, what are you doing? Hurry up about it! - Get moving, stupid beast! - Come on, let's go! - Pigs! Down with the fascists! Come out of there, you bastard! Say that to our faces! Go fuck yourselves! Hicks! Assholes! Here's your democracy! Let's knock the door down! You should be ashamed of yourselves! We'll kick your teeth in! - Come on, give it all you've got! - Yeah, let's kick the door in! - They're attacking from behind! - Quick, attack! Bolsheviks! Put that stick down! I'll snap you in two! Like fair fights, do you? A hundred against eight? Here! Take that! I'll eat you alive! We never back down! Hey, are you crazy? What are you doing?! Help! Hey, what are you doing? Leave me alone! I'm a veteran! Want to play as well, do you? You're shooting at me, asshole?! Son of a bitch! - Fascist! - Don't shoot! - Coward! Take that! Leave me alone! Jesus, Jesus, Jesus! Go fuck yoursel... Good dog! Domenico Rocchetti? Umberto Gavazza? Go fuck yoursel... But why are the fascists cheats? Come on, I want to know why! Do you know why I'm taking care of you? Ask yourself why. Because we fought together in the war, because we were soldiers in arms? No, my dear friend, you're mistaken. It's Christian charity! - Yeah... In the trenches we shared bread, but here we don't share ideas. - So you can eat alone! - Ouch! Careful! All I want to know is why we're cheats. Because you're a bunch of liars, that's why. Oh, really? Then Miss, I'm really sorry to have to tell you this... ... but your brother has absolutely no understanding of the cause... ... because it's the Bolsheviks like yourself who cheat people! Hear that, Adelina? According to him, I'm a Bolshevik. No, of course he's not a Bolshevik! I'm not a Bolshevik! No, it's me who's a Bolshevik, right? Right, I'm the Bolshevik! Well, why are you so against the fascists? - I'll tell you right now. - Go ahead! - One, because I'm a labourer. - Right. Two, because I'm unemployed and caring for that that poor sister of mine, okay... ... because of the exploitation of land owners that you guys defend! No! Look, that's where you're mistaken, but I'll explain later! Go on! - Five... - Five? What happened to three and four? No, I mean, there are five mouths to feed, with just one person in the house working! - You? - No, my brother-in-law! Alright, but there are four of you! And I suppose she doesn't count? She's eating for two, you know? - So that's five. - Proceed. Thirdly, I'm part of the union. Part of what? Don Bosco's Labourers League. Oh, that's good! Then you have nothing to worry about! One day an angel will come down and bring you everything! A house, a nice paycheck, a car, and even a coffee-making machine! Go ahead, laugh it up! A stupid Roman if ever I knew one! You and that boss of yours. What's his name, Mustolino? Mussolini! See how ignorant you are? Why? You think we're with the land owners? We, who according to you are a party for workers and farmers? Listen to this! "Programme of the constitution for the Fascist League of Combatants." "San Sepolcro, 23rd of March." I'll read it. "First. Actually, one:" "Proclamation of the Italian Republic." Right, tomorrow! Hold on! "Two: General disarm." Did you hear that? And that's not all, listen to this: "Abolition of compulsory conscription." Well, I've already done four years in the military! So what? Don't you care about your son? - No. - Because you're a cynic! - No, because I'm a bachelor. But soon you'll have a nephew. Is that right, Miss? Don't you see the shape of the belly? That means it's going to be a girl. If it's a girl, then she's going to have a boyfriend some day! Which means, the boyfriend of your niece won't have to be a soldier! What do I care about the boyfriend of my niece, she's not even born yet! There he goes again, the cynic! What's that, porridge? "The abolition of all noble titles." Alright, this doesn't concern you. But this does! "Land to the farmers, and associated cultivation..." So, we would own our farms? Sure! And there are another 10 in there, each better than the last! Take it and study it, go on! "Confiscation of unproductive sources." What does that mean? It's simple. For example... ... this food is mine but no one is eating it! Fascism says: "Hey, eat it before it gets cold!" So I say: "Well, it's not mine!" "Who cares?!", says Fascism. "Eat the damn thing!" How do you like that ideology? And you say we're cheats! Evening! They took Bertazzoni to hospital with a broken arm! But we sure showed those cowards! If the police hadn't showed up... This is my brother-in-law, Cristoforo Giovanni. - This is an old friend, Domenico Rocchetti. - Nice to meet you... Please leave! - Is he talking to you? - No, he's not that polite to me. Ah, perhaps because I allowed myself a little taste... Yes, that's one reason. Please leave! Why are you treating my friend this way? We served in the military together... That's another reason, and there's another, too... I hate fascists! But, Sir! We're for the freedom of ideas... It's just that it's raining outside and I'm also wounded, you know... Get out! That wasn't as polite, he must be talking to you. No, he's talking to you! And hurry up about it, otherwise I'll drag you out myself! Hold on! No one puts their hands on Domenico Rocchetti! Domenico Rocchetti will put his spoon down, say goodbye and leave peacefully... No, wait! Listen, Cristoforo, I can't allow you to... What can't you allow, hypocrite? You've worked 10 days in the last year, you eat without paying... ... and you even bring this kind of "friend" to the house! Get out! Hey, Adelina, tell your husband that I'm leaving if he carries on like this. Get the hell out! This time he was talking to both of us. Come on, let's go. Don't you have anything to say, Adelina? Right! Does she even speak at all? Then I'm leaving. Of course! We have a good future, and you let yourself get humiliated by this... Alright. But you know what I think? Better with a fascist like him than a Bolshevik like you! Go on, you hypocrite! And when the fascists are giving out land, don't come crawling to me! - Damn, look at that rain! - Give me the umbrella... Let's go! I know those guys are annoying, but you know, they're my family! My brother-in-law isn't a bad guy, he'll probably come after me... Umberto! Hey, don't turn around! Don't let him corrupt you, walk! - Yes, Cristoforo... - Where are you going? That umbrella is mine, and I want it back! That's it! Umberto Gavazza! Well? Now do you get it? Get walking, man! With the future you have, what do you care about your brother-in-law? - Can't you walk by yourself? - Get off me! - Give me that jacket! - Why? - I'll use it to cover us, no? - Do you want my trousers, too? - Come on, get walking! - Hey! - Yeah? - Are we going in? Come on! By now they'll already know the result of the elections. - Do you think we'll win? - What?! Of course we'll win! A landslide victory, you'll see! Come on, act like a warrior! - What's your name? - Aldo Seconcini... To Us! - Where were your born? - In Rome. - When? - 18th of November, '95... Yes, yes! And Monforte? And Lambrate? Allow me to introduce our newest recruit: Umberto Gavazza. Ex-combatant of yesterday, Neo-comrade of today! Quiet! Hello? Hello? Yes, hello... Yes, but what about the other results? Porta Ticinese? Bovisa? Out there on the outskirts are the true proletarian and fascist people! Out there is where the true heart of the people beats! - Out there... - Quiet! Hello? Yes? Final figures... 111! 111,000! Like hell 111,000! There are only 4,000 votes in total! They screwed us over! It's a con alright! We'll demand a recount! God damn it! Traitors, Bolsheviks, thieves! I'll slaughter every single last one of them! Umberto Gavazza! Third battalion, second company, fourth platoon. - You're with us, too? Good man! - Well, actually.. What brought you here? A love for combat? Hate for disorder? - No, Domenico Rocchetti! - Ah, good man! Come on then, Gavazza! About giving land to the farmers, as it says in the programme... Of course, you'll all have land! Why not? Just like Caesar's legionnaires... but not before we attain victory! Yes, but since the victory thing isn't going to happen... I tell you, we will win! What's with all the long faces? We lost the election, okay... ... but we will win for the courage shown down there in the streets! Of course, Soler's theory of violence considers also that of subversion, not only... - Hey, where were you? - I went to call the captain. - ... ending in a transformation of... - Comrades! Not long ago I had the honour... ... of speaking to our leader. The imperative of the moment is this: "Less words, more action." From parliamentary action, we move to direct action. We will fight in the streets. Are you ready? Yes! Yes. That's how you do it! Here, get to work! Hey, you over there, no talking! Come on, students! Hey, you two slobs! Elbow grease! Right, fight in the streets! We're in the street right now! I thought perhaps it would be something a bit more daring. Why? Isn't breaking the strike of the street-sweepers daring enough? They have their own statement they're trying to make. What statement? They're on strike because they follow the slavish orders of Lenin! That's what the captain said. Oh, really? Well the captain also said: "We lost the election but who cares?!" Sorry, but that doesn't seem right. - Why not? - Hey, I might be from Bergamo but I still know how to read a little! See what's written here on the programme? "Sovereignty of the people with free elections..." So what? You're a fool, because since we didn't get enough... ... votes in the free elections... ... instead we'll get sovereignty in our own way, you see? Then I'll cross that line out. - Hey, what is this woman doing? - Long live Italy? - What is it? - Work! - Hey, give me one! - Well done! Well done! Thank you! Thank you! "From the Milan Lovers of Order to those substituting the street-sweepers..." "... who are on strike, giving the city a moral and material cleaning, thank you!" You're welcome! Though, while thanking us for our moral cleaning... ... they make the street a mess and we have to sweep it up! Get to work with that broom! Do your civic duty! Such fine gentlemen you are! You have the face of a fine gentleman, too! Please, no compliments. Pick up this broom instead! I'm not the kind of man who backs down, you know? Give that here! I'll show you how to sweep! I fought in the war and I've always done my duty! - Good man! - I'm an industrialist, but I know how to sweep. - I fought in the war too, you know. Well, you've done well! But I was just a simple soldier. You missed a bit of lettuce over there. Where's this bit of lettuce? There you go, all done! - See? - Sorry about this. - Don't worry about it! These Milanese... moral cleaning! No, I don't... I'm with you. I don't do politics, you know? Hey, you can't do that... - Oh, God! - Domenico? - Be quiet! - I found someone to give me a hand. - Look at the hands on him... on them! - Fascists, to Us! - To Us! Quick, this way! What are you doing, trying to hit me? It's closed! Hold on... Hey, here comes the cavalry! Get the women out of here! - Move, I'll take care of this one! - No, it's the Royal Guards! Now you're in trouble! You could have stopped me! ... the disgruntled public... ... and the inconvenience caused to this community... ... this must be seen as a pretext to the abuse of power. For this, and because the accused should be used as an example... ... despite the fact that they... ... are clearly not bad people... ... but mere ill-advised flotsam... ... I ask for the maximum penalty allowed by law for such a crime. Don't worry, our defence will take care of everything! Your Honour, gentlemen of the jury... The catharsis of historical politics... ... that spreads through the lifeblood of our country... ... has swept my clients away on to the bank of the accused. For these young patriots... ... and their impulsiveness... ... the only justice can be complete and irrefutable absolution. An absolution that will bring honour to this country... One year and eight months, thanks to you! - Oh, I've had enough of you! - And eight months! - I'd never been to jail before you came along! - Yeah, you're never to blame... It's all your fault, a stupid Roman if ever I knew one! So this is our bright future, is it?! Right, because you were doing so well back at the house! You wanted to come, didn't you? What do you want from me?! - Ah, so it's my fault?! - No, it was me! - So it's my fault?! - Get out of my face! - Put your hands down, you don't know... - Put your hands down... What was that?! - Stop! - Stop! Enough! Come here... I'll have you! Let me at him! - Who started it? - It was him! 121. Why are you singing, idiot? Does it feel like springtime to you? - Son of a... - Afternoon, guys! - Wait here! For those who don't know me, my name is Suffreghin. - Well? Suffreghin in Milanese means Sulphur. - Are you an activist, too? - Well, yes. - How are the fascists doing? - What fascists? - The Fascist League of Combatants? - Ah, I don't know anything about that. Suffreghin, you don't need to be afraid of talking in here. Yeah, in here we're all comrades of the political faith. What are they doing? Are they giving in? Fighting? Well, you know, that's not really my line of work... What do you mean? Aren't you an activist? Yeah, they caught me for stealing a senator's wallet! Coming! "Distinguished Cristoforo..." "The absence of our Umberto means that I write this letter in haste..." "... to inform you that in a few months the dear and willing Umberto..." "The poor Umberto..." "... will be out of jail, and looking for a place to stay again." "I'm sure he would come hone, as long as he never knows that I wrote the letter." "Since Umberto is a proud character..." "... and he would never allow me to give him a helping hand." - Got it? - Yeah, alright! - "Since being left out in the cold..." "He is very offended, and ready to strike down upon you!" "Strike down upon you!" Umberto, you'll ruin it! I'm writing this, not you! You suggest the idea, I'll write it all down for you. "Not just offended but discouraged, at the lack of news from you." "Write to him... write him..." "Write Umberto a nice letter as a way of reconciliation..." "... and don't allow this to drag on any further." "Especially since the fascist party has been bled dry." Alright, you do it! "... the curtain is closing on fascism." "Sincerely, Comrade Domenico Rocchetti." - Hey! - What's going on?! What's all this noise? Must be some kind of party! Yeah, today is the St' Ursula's day! Free the activists! Let our comrades walk free! They're throwing rocks, Sir! They're armed and dangerous! What?! I only have 30 men and they all have families of their own! The local police? I called them, they were busy! They sent all their men to Trevignano for the farm workers' strike! We want our comrades! Let the fascists out or we kick down the door! Out! Sir, if you don't know what to do... ... how am I supposed to know? Free the fascists! - Can you see the fireworks? - I don't see anything! Forget St. Ursula, this is mutiny! - Out, comrades, you're free! - Free on parole? What do you mean, parole? Who cares about parole?! I told you they would come! Defeatist! Here, this is yours! - Come on, move it! - Hooray! Hooray! Get a move on, quick! Move it! Come on, let's go! Move it, you beasts! You're free! Who are you? Are you with us? I'm an activist! Rocchetti! Gavazza! He's not an activist, he's a fascist! He's with us! Quick, get out of here! What happened, did we win? We're ready for the march on Rome! - They're going to give us land? - To Rome! - To Rome! Charge! What a man, that Mussolini! In Rome they offered him six portfolios and he refused them all! He refused the portfolios? Why? Because he wanted more. On the 24th in Naples he said: "We don't want plates of lentils." "Either they deliver us the government, or we go in and take it by force!" - He must have a big set of... - Of course! Captain Paolinelli! Hey, it's our captain! Captain! To Us! To Rome or death, Captain! - To Us! - Give me your hand, Captain! Roman salute! - To Us! Long live Italy! - To Us! To Us! Hey you, what are these beasts doing? Get them off the road, now! Hey, why is it quiet back here? Wake up, kids! Come on! Whoever throws it before the count of ten is a bastard! One... two... three... Four... five... - Six... - Some friend you are! Here! I'm a bastard! Guys, this is my village! A nice little village, too! Full of Bolsheviks. We did an election rally, I even got wounded. Such experiences, Comrade! I really envy you! I got hit by a stone, you know... Yeah, shovelful! Let us through! These cows again! Let the truck through, come on! Forward! Go back! Out of the way! Get out of the road! - This is my village, you know! - Filthy little place. - Want some? - Give me a sip! Hey, Adelina! It's me, Umberto! Cristoforo! What name did you give the baby? How's work? Bad, is it? We're going to Rome, you know! They're giving us land! You'll see, Cristoforo! This is what fascism is all about! But I'm not mad at you, you know? Cristoforo! What did you call the baby? What's her name? Hey! The baby! Hey, what's wrong? - They could have at least waved. - They're farmers. No manners! - Hey, move it! That's my chair! - What do you want? Don't listen to him... It's alright, just leave it. Sit down then, idiot! Guys, you have an hour! Don't annoy the women! Let's show them that we can become the ruling class! Did you hear that, beasts? ... it's time to lead with our fists! Come on, let's stick it to them! Burn it! Burn the paper! Let's show these Reds who we are! Give him a warm welcome! PROLETARIAN UNITY Burn this chair, too! Burn everything! Throw it down! Burn it! Burn it! Clean the streets! - Hey, Domenico. - What is it? - Not to be critical, but... ... what do they take us for, idiots? - For what? - For a bunch of idiots! - Why? - This doesn't tie in with the programme! That's it! What does Article 14 say? "Freedom of the press." - So what?! - So why are they burning the press? Because it's cold? Ah, Umberto, you don't know how these things work! Allow me to explain: A) If they have freedom of the press, we have the freedom to burn it! B) If they were afraid we would burn it, they wouldn't even have a press! Throw that big-head down! We'll throw him on the fire, him and all other Reds like him! - C) ... - C) They're screwing us in the... Think whatever you like, just don't bother me with it! Well, I'm crossing that line out! Here, I'll even give you a pencil! Knock yourself out! Smash it! Brigadier, many of them don't even have a gun license. So what? You, get to work! I want writing all over the walls of this city! Yes, Sir! Hey, the rest of you! Everyone who knows how to write... ... go and get a bucket of paint. Write on the walls, on the houses, and on the churches: "Long live fascism!" "Down with communism!" Hey, where are you going? Find a wall and start writing! Right away, Comrade! What, you're just standing there?! Go and get a bucket of paint immediately! On the double! You too! Ah, me too? "Fassi..." "Fassist..." Umberto, how do you spell fascist? Domenico, this is good land! Heavy soil, sandy soil... Look at this stuff! "Fascist." What comes first, "S" or the "C"? And the smell! Amazing! Too much fertilizer, I think. The soil is quite acidic. It must be adapted for durum wheat. What do you care about the soil, right? - But you like your bread, don't you? - Move it, Ginetta! Heavy, is it? Of course it is, your head is to the side rather than the middle! - May I give you a hand? Or, a head. - Well, thank you. You know, I used to be a farmer myself so I know all about it! You did the right thing, I'd rather risk getting shot than work the land all day. No, I'm risking getting shot because I want some land, that's why I'm here! Here, let me carry it! - It's heavy, you know? - Don't worry about it! Heavy, isn't it? What is it, damp hay? I'm tired of all this! I want to get out of here. Better to be a servant in the city! Be careful what you do, you know, the land will always be land! You plant wheat, it brings you wheat. You plant radishes, it brings you radishes. Yeah, but it never brings you money! And at night you're as tired as a dog! - Sorry? - It's a dog's life! - This is my third load since 5 this morning, you know? - Really? And the hay has scratched my neck all over, look! Oh, wow, look at that! See, it goes all the way down! - Look, look at that! - May I? Just look at that! - See it? - I see it! - And guess who did that? - Right, your boss! So, what kind of work is it? Sharecropping? When I worked as a labourer the pay wasn't all that bad. Two or three lire a day, but you only work two or three times a week. And then there was that Bolshevik brother-in-law of mine... That's why I'm here. Not for anything else! You say: "I want to work in the city." My dear lady... ... it's no bed of roses, you know? It's tough work, I'll tell you that! Because, see, the land is like a mother. When I was little, when I was left all alone as an orphan... When we were out in the fields, it felt like my mother was close by! Comrades, it's Captain Paolinelli! Comrades, next stop Mantova! More people for us to purge! - Here's the list. Hit Squad, To Us! - To Us! To Us! Dr. Antonio Baragli, country doctor! I'll give him some of his own medicine! Mario Arpinati, grocer! Hey, do we have to go too? - Is it obligatory? - No, it's an act of voluntary justice. Do it yourself! - Milziade Bellinzoni! - Hey, Mitraglia! - What was that? Milziade ... - Bellinzoni! The very man who condemned you for your ideologies! - That son of a... - With the beard and the cane? Yeah, but the lion has lost his claws! These days he's retired magistrate! Hear that? First he condemns us, then he retires! - Let's go, comrades! - Move out! - Purge the anti-fascists! Arms and bags, let's go! Guys, we're in Mantova! Batons! Truncheons! Commemorative medals! Souvenirs of the march on Rome! Batons! Truncheons! Medals... They have skulls embroidered on their chests. They must be from the Order of Saint Giovanni Calasante! Out of the way, comrade! Excuse me, Reverend! - Why aren't you saluting? - I lost two fingers in the war! Well? Put it down, you beast! Make way, make way! - Faithful Mantova! - Thank you, darling! His Excellency of the quadrumvirate! These guys have done their job, now it's our turn. Let's go! In here! Umberto! Let's summarize: I'll grab him, get my arms around his neck... ... put him on the ground and you stick castor oil down his throat, okay? This is him! What if he gets mad and starts kicking us and stuff? Then we whack him on the head. Yeah, but if we hit him on the head he'll faint! Then how will we make him drink the castor oil? All we have to do is tilt back his head... Damn, he's not even answering! Kick the door down, go on! Me? Hold this! I'll show you how it's done! Look out, here I come! Does Professor Bellinzoni live here? Bellinzoni, come out! - Where is he? - Are you from the coal company? - What? - Here for the professor? - Yes. - Do you have an appointment? - Yes, we've been waiting for 2 years! Then wait here. I'll go and call him. Bellinzoni, now it's your turn! - Umberto! - What? - No signs of weakness, okay? - No, I was listening to the clock. - What do you care about a clock? Hey, maybe he's escaping! Quick, over there! Good day. Have you not been shown through? No, we've not been shown through. Please, go on through! - Hey, where did you put the bottle? - Damn, I left it through there! Make yourself comfortable! What bottle? So, apparently we had an appointment? - Ah, you don't recognise us? - No. Did you hear that? He doesn't recognise us. Ah, he doesn't recognise us? Milan, 1920. The bloody street sweepers' strike. Criminal court, 2 years behind bars. CASTOR OIL Those gentlemen, they remind me... ... of a very difficult moment in my life. Marta, the vermouth! Mine, by tradition, has always been a family of magistrates. My great grandfather was one, as was my grandfather and father. Yes! For all their lives! I, instead, decided to resign. Oh, really? Well, why should we give a damn about your resignation? A magistrate may judge only if he is independent... ... and a man is independent only if he is completely free. But I was no longer a man who enjoyed his freedom. Yeah, and you were the one who took away our freedom, for 2 years! Frankly, you were quite unfortunate in that trial, young men. Today, you would find more lenience... ... on the part of many judges. So, if you were to try us today... No! No, I have not changed. God bless! I would ask for you to be sentenced today... ... just as you were sentenced back then! - Are you not drinking? - No. You are irresponsible folk... ... but it is not all your fault. When zealotry takes the place of reason... ... the road is always full of deceptions. And the greatest deception is this: That one believes in loving one's nation... ... only if this nation is a place... ... where everyone thinks in the same way. And this is how one ends up loving... ... a nation of slaves... ... and doesn't realise that they themselves are slaves. Done! Now... I must go, you know where... ... and you, go back to your Benito Mussolini! Marta! See these gentlemen out! The bottle! The baton! Where are you going? It's this way. This way, come on! Goodbye, have a nice day! That will do! Get your hands off me! My God, you men these days! Keep your hands to yourselves! Irresponsible folk! - Who? - Us! He called us "irresponsible"! - Yeah, and also "slaves"! - No... I heard it, damn... I didn't hear anything! Anyway, he told a pack of lies! A pack of lies! Besides, he's the slave! He even drank all that castor oil... ... after I told him to fill the glass. God bless! - What? - I didn't say anything! Don't drink so much if you can't take it... Silence! Turn the music off! We're moving out! Guys, listen up! Tomorrow at dawn we set off for Rome! How much is the bill? No, no, Comrade, that's not fair! Let's split the bill... We'll split the bill when I say so! I'll pay it! - How much? - 20 lire. - I hope you're not overcharging! What's that? Five... ten... - Get your hands off me! - Eighteen... - Keep them to yourself! - And two, twenty! - What's this? - Don't you see, you beast? They're photos of Mussolini, worth one lira each! If I may, comrade, I'll pay the tip. Here, that's Italo Balbo. Let's go, comrades! What's going on? Get out! You can't do such a thing! Roaches, parasites, vermin! Pigs! - Hey... - What is it? - Domenico... - What do you want? - But, we... who are we? - In what sense? - In the sense that you said: "We showed the professor who we were." Of course, I'll explain... What were we before all this? Me, a zero, and you another zero. - And now? What are we now? - A pair of zeros! Yes, a pair of... a pair of men! And the man... you know what the man needs, don't you? - Right now? - Yeah. He needs a woman! - No... - Get out of here, deadbeat! - Hey, come back here! - Leave her alone, she's a whore! A man needs to feel like someone. To feel powerful, and not like all these fools around here. You know? This is why I love fascism! Yes, because even a fool can feel powerful! That's it! Let me give you a kiss! - You're a bastard! - I'll smack you in the... Not you, the dog! No bed or bone?! Then come with us and become a comrade! Do you have a brother-in-law? Then go to him and you'll see that he shows you respect... ... takes his hat off to you! - Not like at my house. - Why? What did they do to you? Yeah, right... "Umberto, keep it down, Cristoforo is sleeping!" And you know what I did? - Kept it down! - Right, kept it down! "Umberto, thank Cristoforo for looking after us!" - And you thanked him! - No, I didn't thank him... Because even I have some dignity left, damn it! So, you know what he did? He sent me in the stalls to clean out the cow and sheep dung! You don't know what it's like! What a shit head! How terrible! How much you've suffered! You shouldn't have hit me with that shovel though, okay? - What shovel? - You shouldn't have hit me! - What shovel?! - Me, a friend! - I promise that I didn't mean it! - Then swear it! - Look, I swear! - On your life! - On your life! Alright, enough! - What is it? - There's no one here. They've all left. Damn, we've been left behind! Come on, let's go! - Let me put my shoes back on! - What? I can't sleep with my shoes on, see. You should have brought your pyjamas, too! Comrades! Are we leaving? Domenico Rocchetti! At your command! Who's that? What do you want? Hey, who's that? Oh God, it's the Reds! Take it easy, okay? What did I ever do to you? Take it easy! No! Jesus Christ... Umberto! Umberto! Umberto! How many of you are there?! No! Help! Help! Umberto! Take it easy! Hey, I'm with you! I'm a friend of the workers! I'm a friend of the people! Long live the people! Damn, am I tired! Damn, I hope you burn... A cancer on all of you! You'll see! Hey, friends! Have you seen a truck loaded with fascists pass by here? - Hey, I'm speaking to you! - Guys, he's a fascist! No, what are you doing?! Are you crazy?! Stop that! I'm a farmer like you! Damn bastards, that's what you are! But it's not your fault! You don't know about justice... ... but one day you'll thank me! Damn, that hurts! Jesus Christ! Damn bastards, all of you! No one loves me, everyone just throws rocks at me, damn it! Jesus... damn it... Damn... Domenico! - Domenico, where are you running? - Coward... I said you're a dirty coward! What could I have done to help? Why are you running like that? They told me to run 10 km without stopping otherwise they would start shooting! Are you crazy?! You've done more than 10 km! It's not even 9! - Come on, take a rest! - Let go of me! Domenico! Domenico! Animals! Wild animals! At least you're in one piece, those guys threw rocks at me! Threw rocks at you? Here, take a look at that! Damn, that's bad! Was it them? No, it was me! They didn't want to because barbers don't work on Mondays! So I had to insist! Damn it, I could kill you! They ruined me! Hey, who's that? It's the Reds, they're back! No, it's a gentleman's car! Don't you see? It's a limousine! No, I don't trust it! They're sneaky, come on! I'll stop them! Halt! Halt! What's going on here? What is it? What do you want? Sorry, but since we've lost contact with our unit... ... and we need to reach the rest of our comrades, we'll need the car! No, no, no, nothing doing! I'm sorry, there's no room. Look, there are 3 seats back here! You're trying to screw us over! Get out of here! Hey, who do you think you're talking to? You should have some respect! Get in, Umberto, go on! Get your hands off me! You're playing with death, friend! We're from the Hit Squad, You must not have heard of us! The nerve of this guy! Scoundrels, you don't know who you're dealing with! And who are we dealing with? I'm the Marquis Veniero Bellotti Spini. Hear that, Umberto? It's the Marquis Bellotti Spini. Wow, really? In the flesh? Who gives a damn, how about that? I know I don't! All noble titles are abolished! And since you're not collaborating, do you know what happens now? What happens is you get out and walk because the car has been requisitioned! Is that clear? Come on, Umberto, help the marquis get out. Come on, Marquis Bellotti Spini, get the hell out of the way! Scoundrels, you're in no end of trouble! This is my land, I'll call my farmers! Does this thing have a handbrake? Those are your farmers? Quick, Domenico, they're coming! - Let go, Marquis! - Help! Stop them! We already told you, the car has been requisitioned! There's nothing we can do! Let go of the car! Come on, you'll hurt yourself! Will you let go?! Don't worry, you'll get your car back! - To Rome, To Rome! - When we're in power! Farewell, Marquis! It's the tibula or the fibula! Take it easy, please! Hey, ladies! Which way is Via Cassia? This way! - You can't miss it! - Thanks a lot. - Don't mention it. Let's go, that way! - Where are you going? - Hey! - They said to the right! - What, you think I'm an idiot? - To the right! Out here the farmers don't trust us. They think we're the enemy, you know... So if they say go right, I go left. They said to go right. Remember, his name is Pietro! "... and proceeded on their march, received all over with enthusiasm and..." Here! Go on, comrades! Hey! Gavazza! Rocchetti! - Where have you been? - Hello! What happened to you? We had a run-in with the Reds! - You should see them now! - Where's Captain Paolinelli? 2 km further down. - Sit down, let's go! - See you later, guys! Straight ahead. You can't miss it! - Where are you going? - Damn it, the gears are inverted! To Us! - The statue! - I see it! It has slow brakes. An old wreck, this car! Comrades Rocchetti and Gavazza reporting! - Is Captain Paolinelli here? - He's with His Excellency. Call him! What are you looking at? Umberto, why don't we give the car to His Excellency... ... instead of Paolinelli? Yeah, now that we've broken everything, even that nice statue! Mussolini will pay for the statute. The car just needs a clean... ... a few new mudguards, and it'll be fine! Let's go! Captain, we confronted the enemy! Well done! Report to me, quickly! Comrades Gavazza and Rocchetti reporting! Excellency, we have confronted the enemy and defeated them. There were five of them and we really put it to them... And after a hard fight, we have also requisitioned an automobile. This is why, Excellency, we would be very honoured if you... ... if you would accept this automobile as a modest gesture! There they are! Thieves! It's them! It's them! - Criminals! - Marquis, Sir, calm yourself! We will take care of everything. They're fascists... But they're scoundrels! Captain, show that dirty capitalist land-owner over there a lesson! Quiet, you! Please calm down, Marquis... ... it's just a terrible misunderstanding! Of course, if they had known that you were with us... Look, look at my car! Look what they've done to me! Scoundrels! Scoundrels! They destroyed the statue, too! We are extremely sorry, Sir, but please, they had no idea know who you were! - But I told them! - Oh, really? Yes, I told them and they just laughed in my face! They threw me down and hurt me, look what they did to my foot! Please, you have to forgive them! They're young, impulsive... Excellency, such an affront to me, your main financial supporter! After all the money I have provided for your cause! And you know very well how much! This is the thanks I get?! This is what I get in return?! A fascist comrade... ... must ignore the reward... ... when he behaves like a hero. Am I right? Yes, Excellency! But accept the punishment... ... when he behaves like an imbecile. Am I right? Yes, Excellency! - Ouch! What are you doing?! - My God, that hurts! - Please, let us explain! - Stop! - No, not my head! - Damn it, that hurts! Hey, pass me the flask! Get rid that filth! I'll show you a good cigarette. Sorry, this is my last one. If we keep this up we'll be in Rome three hours from now. Let's have a look... Did you inherit that, Soffreghin? The slight of hand? Yeah, from his father! Not this sheet again! What are you crossing out this time? "The abolition of all noble titles." Gone! "Land to the farmers, and associated cultivation..." Gone! You know what I think, Umberto? It's better this way. At least you don't need to work the land now. You can change trade! Be an industrialist! Good voice! What do you mean by "Putin"? Long live the fascists! Bye, lovely ladies! Bye, we're going to Rome! - Hooray! Well done! - Bye, Blondie! Hey, slowcoaches! See you in Rome! Hurry up or there'll be nothing left! Move it, slowpokes! - Get over here, idiot! - Start the engine! Hey, I give the orders around here! - What's wrong with it? - It must be the magnet, it's worn out! Hurry up, you beast! The train! The train! Stop! Get back on board, cowards! Don't you see the train?! - Come on, back on the truck! - Listen to this guy! It's just a locomotive, see? It's slowing down! Like hell it's slowing down! Look where they've stopped! - Hey, what are they doing? - They're not stopping. - Stop, comrades, we're fascists! - Stop! Who are these guys? They're fascists! They're fascists alright! Then let's go, full speed ahead! You dirty bastards! Come back here, I'll rip you to shreds! Listen up, guys! We're walking to Rome! Onward! Onward! Come on, guys... ... we're almost there! Onward! Onward! Come on, Aurelia is just over that hill! Hey, move your ass! - Need a hand, Mitraglia? - Get moving, weakling! Sing! "With holy zeal their swelling hearts abound..." "As their winged footsteps brush the ground..." "Behold, Jerusalem in prospect lies!" "Behold, Jerusalem salutes their eyes!" Sit down! Have they booked some hotel rooms for the officers? I think so. Anyway, I'd love it if you would come with me tonight... ... and meet the exquisite Countess Chigi Strucchi, my very good friend... ... who is bursting with beauty and has a body still luxuriant... ... as well as an obligingly blind and useless husband, meaning that... Hey, where are you going? Hey you, what's going on here? It's the soldiers. They've blocked the road. It's that General Cittadini, I should have known! We are men hellbent on reaching Rome at whatever cost... ... and you, young man, are taking on a responsibility that you... Look, my dear sir... I'm a colonel! And I'm a general of His Majesty's service, not a young man! Anyway, all the roads that lead to Rome are blocked. 15,000 men, Colonel! And your government thinks it can stop our victorious march? If by the third sound of our horn the road is not cleared... ... we will open fire. You will live to regret this day. Sound the horn! Turn back, they're opening fire! You don't give orders on my behalf! Turn back, they're opening fire! Quick guys, let's get out of here! Captain! We're here, the shortcut worked! This is Aurelia! Now we won't have to walk! Where are the others? They must be around here, I heard the sound of a horn. There they are! Our men! - To Us! - Comrades! Fire! What's going on?! Don't shoot, I surrender! - Get out of here! - Quick, guys! Hurry! Did you attack the barricade? - Hey, why are they shooting? - Go and ask His Majesty the King! - It's him who gives the orders. - The King? But, he's so small! - Hey, what are you eating? - A rubber band. Want some? Nice, isn't it? Reminds me of the war. Things were better back then. No, that smell reminds me of broth with meat... - What smell? - Can't you smell it? - Let's go. - Where? Soldier! Listen, there's just two of us, me and my friend here... So what? Get out of here! Ah, you're from Rome too? We're all from Rome! "Damn you!" See? Alright, take it easy. What are you even doing here? Why don't you just go home? We're obeying orders, just like you! Hey, what do you get as rations? Potatoes? Two rations and a bit of meat... Tasty, and I bet it's hot! You can dip the bread in it! Keep your kitchen tips to yourself! Hey, soldier, listen up! Would you mind giving us a bit, just to warm us up? Hungry are you, comrades? No, it's just that our cook makes too much spicy food! We need some good soldier's food! With the meat, too! I know, but how can I pass it to you? - They're shooting, you know? - Leave it on the ground! I'll leave it just here, but we never spoke, okay? Hurry up, otherwise it'll get cold! - Yeah, go on! - Who, me? Get moving! - Why me? - I'll watch your back! Alright... And I'm older than you. Move it! Go on, move that ass! Bastards, have some dignity! - Who's shooting? - The fascists! - Let's shelter over there. - Yeah. - Under here! - Get out of here, there's no room! - Don't you have anything to eat? - Yeah, spaghetti and veal! If you want some chicken there's a bit left! - Get out of the truck! - What kind of comrades are you? Alright guys, I spoke to our superiors on the telephone. All is well. It's just a brief pause while they sort out the last details. Tomorrow, I want to see everyone ready for the last push! Comrades, goodnight and sleep well! At your command, Captain! Did I hear that right? Right?! Like hell it's right! I didn't want to encourage the spread of panic in the ranks... ... but the command in Perugia didn't answer once! - Well? - Well, what? Now it turns out the Duke has fled to Switzerland. - Why Switzerland? - How should I know? And get rid of that ridiculous umbrella! You guys, where are you going? Come on! And close those umbrellas! Think of the impression we're making! - Hey, didn't you hear? No umbrellas! - Who's going to see? Let's go! You two, let's stick together! This water is a blessing for the land! We need the Kaiser! - Soffreghin, come here! - Quick, Soffreghin! - Give me that safety pin, quick! - I don't have one! - The one on the medal! - Ah, yes! Give it to him! He's good! - Damn, he has hands of gold! - He's a professional! - Everyone on board! - See that? - Quick, get in! - Come on! - Hurry! - Come on! - Don't push! Come on, we're getting wet out here! What's going on here?! You're not allowed to be here! And who's going to stop us? Go on, get out of here! - You guys must be crazy! - Get out of here! - Go home! But, I'll lose my job! Get your hands off me! - Want a taste of my baton? - You're crazy, you have to leave! - Did you hear what he said? Get going! - Alright, I'll go and inform the soldiers! Idiots, stop him! - Where are you going, bastard? - Why, what are you going to do? He's dead. He asked for it. Now he won't tell anyone. Get rid of the body! Well? Come on, move it! Move it, you beasts! Come on, let's go! You two, what are you doing? Get inside! Make way for your superior! Get rid of this umbrella! And close the door! Umberto! Umberto! Hey! Umberto! Hey! - Hey, where are you going? - For a piss, what do you care? - You need to put your shoes on? - You piss without shoes? - Yeah. Come on, don't lie! You're going to cut and run! And what if I am? Listen, I've always put up with your bullshit... But now, you know what I think of this programme of yours? - See, that's what I think! - Well? I'm not cut out for killing people, I don't even like to see it. Right, and I suppose I do? What do I care about the programme? Who cares? Umberto Gavazza! - You can't leave like this, I forbid it! - Oh, really? - Yes! And what gives you the right? I'm the older one, I think you'll find! That's true! - Though I'm still leaving. - No you're not, and keep your voice down! - No, I'm leaving and I'll talk how I want! - No, you're staying right here. Oh, really? I'm leaving! Poor little Umberto! Move that foot and see what happens! No, you're the poor one! I'm leaving! Really? No, it looks like you're staying! - Alright, I'm staying. - That's it! You said you were staying! Let go of me! I'll show you! I'll kill you! Come on, lie down! - Lie down! - No! Lie down, damn it! Think you're stronger than me? Much stronger! - Do you give in? - Yes, I give in. You better believe it! Come on, back inside! Want to fight me? I'm twice your size! Alright? Let's go! Some friendship this is! You leave me all alone! If you're a friend, why don't you come with me? Wait! Let me get my shoes, okay? Hey, where are you going? Wait! - Hurry up! - Wait! Why are you running? Hey, you two! Stop right there! Where are you going? Let's go back! Here I am, Mitraglia! - Running away, are we? - Here I am! No, it was him! I went to stop him! Get over here, Gavazza! Filthy murderer! Mitraglia, that's enough! Cut it out! You're hurting him! Hey, are you listening! Enough! Pick on someone your own size! Take that! Take this! Bastard! Umberto! Help! Filthy murderer! Umberto, hurry! Hurry! Quick, let's get out of here! Damn, you really whacked him one! But, this means surrendering! No, of course not, Colonel... But, the fascists are disbanding, and you want to let them through? I see. But last night we were told the opposite. Are you sure this a kind of mistake? Very well! At your command, Colonel! Did you hear that? Move the road block. Let them pass, General Cittadini's orders! - What are you waiting for? - Yes, Sir! This way, do you see it? We're back on the road. Now we just have to decide! Rome, or Orta. Comrades, listen up! Listen up! The fascist revolution has won! We're going to Rome! Everyone to their positions! Quick, load up the trucks! To your positions! Gather up everything! Arms and equipment! Line up! Hit Squad, at the ready! At the ready! See that? They made it! I wouldn't be so sure! They might put the government in their hands, but it'll never last! Thinks will change, you'll see! From this, to this! I promise... So, what about the King? Did they drive him out? Drive him out? It was him who let them in... ... which means we can kiss the republic goodbye! Hold on a minute, that means he still has to speak! Of course, he has the last word! And when he talks, damn... Admiral, in your impartial opinion, what do you make of these fascists? Do you really think we are putting the country in safe hands? Just whisper your opinion to me... ... because we're still in time to throw them out, you know? Honestly, Your Majesty, they seem like serious people. Yes, let's try it for a few months!
