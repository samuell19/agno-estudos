What'II we do with it? Ruin it! Hello, everyone. I'm Buttons, and welcome to the Spring Festival. To open our show, and performing together for the very first time anywhere, the Baby Pony Dancers. Let's hear it for them. Bring down the curtain! Look what you've done. Look what you're wearing. You've spoiled the whole number. I'm sorry. Show-off. Hotdog. I thought my step was better. I didn't mean to spoil everything. Well, you did! Everyone was counting on you. Oh, Lickety-Split, how could you be so selfish? You can't do this.

I don't need anyone. Wait for me! Remember, we have to make everything dark, dank-- And dreary. But how? I don't know. Dark and dreary sound pretty hard to do. Well, then we'll make everything dank. -What's dank? -I don't know. Maybe it's in here. Uh, dabble, dagger, damage, dandruff. Oh, here it is. Dank. Oh, it means wet. That's it! We'll make everything wet. We need some water. Over there! Perfect! We'll take the water from here and send it back over there! We'll flood the place. Hydia will be very proud of us. Not like that! You're a witch, cast a spell. But I never cast a spell before. Wait, here's one. Gurznic, ridget, Iemonismick! Let me see that. Now read it. Sorry. Kinsenomal, tikderve, kinsreg, erzaminig, flama botswaggle. That's better. Well? Well, I read what it said. It worked! Yuck, disgusting. Ew, what smells? We do. It's the witches from the Volcano of Gloom. They're cute. Cute? She called us cute! How embarrassing. I'm going home. We can't go home. We haven't made everything dark, dank, and dreary. What'll we tell Hydia? We'll tell her we made it messy. Hurry, Spike! Look, this is a good place. A good place for what? Oh, my feet are killing me. To fly. Like Wind Whistler and North Star. But they're Pegasus ponies. You're just an earthling. You can't fly. Can too. I can do anything. Watch. No, you'll get hurt! We're flying! We're falling! I guess I can't fly. Can we go home now? I told you. I'm never going back to Dream Castle. Baby Lickety-Split's gone! Ran away! And Spike's with her. Oh, dear. Maybe I was too harsh on her at the show. Don't blame yourself, Buttons. I'll find her. Don't worry. I'll go with you, just in case. Can I go with you? I never get to go anywhere. Oh, no. Shady's nothing but bad luck. Just give me a chance. My Iuck's bound to change. I think. Everyone deserves a chance, Shady. You're in. Lickety-Split loves the Bushwoolies. Maybe she went there. Good idea. Let's ride. Be careful! Stay alert! Say hi to the bushwoolies for me. One evil deed, that's all I asked. Oh, you're such a disappointment. I've given you everything a witch could want. Shabby clothes, a rotten place to live, all the foul-tasting food you can eat! And what do I get back? Nothing! Malevia over at Nightmare Heights, her daughter made Easter Sunday come out on a Tuesday! What have you done? Zip! A big fat zero! Uh, we, we, uh, we're really sorry, Hydia. Maybe if we tried again. You've humiliated me enough. We'll have to do something else. Something bigger. Something more evil. What? Let me think. I've got it! Oh! It's time to get tough. It's time to show those little ponies we mean business. It's time for the Smooze! (both gasping) The Smooze? That's right! The same stuff that wiped out that kingdom on the other side of the Black Mountains. Grundleland? Grundleland, what a joke. Those little Grundies never knew what hit 'em. Get out of there! Now in order to make the Smooze, we need a few things. Here, go get 'em. Um, mold, mildew, muck, mire. Fungus, slime, rust, and, and Phlume? Yes, phlume! Not phlume, Hydia. Don't make us get phlume. Please don't. We'll get all the other things, but not phlume. You'll get what I tell you to get. Now, get going! Kids. I'll give you a shove. I can do it myself. Okay. I was just trying to help. What's your rush? If we don't get the stuff for the Smooze, Hydia will be even madder at us. And you know what that means. You got it. The thought of all those things makes me sick.

All she has to do is look in the bucket. There. She'll never know the difference. You carry it. Klutz. I'm too heavy, Spike. It's all right. Dragons are strong. But you're just a baby dragon. I'm still a dragon. You hear something? My horn itches. Something must be wrong. Something doesn't have to be wrong, Shady. Think positive for a change. Look! -Help, Magic Star! -Shady, Gusty! -Down here! -Help! The waterfall's making too much noise. Down here! Help, help! I heard something that time. Well, I didn't. Maybe it's going to rain. Maybe we'll get all wet and catch pneumonia. Oh, I knew you shouldn't have come. No, I like the rain. I love it. We'll worry about the rain later. We have to find Spike and Lickety-Split. They're leaving! Nobody'll ever find us down here. We'll never get home. That you, shadow? Guess so. Hey, bushwoolies, it's spring! It's spring, it's spring, hooray! The sun is shining and the snow is gone. Yeah, the snow is gone. And it's a beautiful day. A beautiful day! Beautiful, beautiful. You get the stuff? All of it. -Everything. -Excellent! Now, let's see what we shall throw in first. Ah, a little muck for power and strength. Ooh, a gob of slime to make it ooze. Some fungus for that little added zip. Ooh, she's gonna find out that-- Shut up! A splash of phlume to make... What? Where's the phlume? You, you, you clumsy pea-brain! Look what you've done! It doesn't, I mean, I mean, you were going to throw it all in anyway, weren't you? It's not the same. Look, it's working! It is working! The Smooze is alive! We did it! Say good-bye to the Little Ponies. -Bye, ponies. -Good-bye, ponies. Come on, we'll be late. Hi, bushwoolies. Hi, Magic Star. We were just leaving for the festival. With all kinds of bushmelons. And we baked wooliecakes, too, see? We're looking for Baby Lickety-Split. Did you lose her? She ran away. Ran away? Oh, dear! -(rumbling) -Behind you! Out of the way! Hurry! Look out! -Move it! -Careful, careful! What is that? Get the wooliecakes! Yeah, yeah, the wooliecakes! Never mind those! Get on! Gusty, oh, look at you. It's all my fault. I know it. Yeah, it is! You're bad luck! It's not your fault, Shady. Yes, it is, yes, it is! It's her fault! I can hardly move! Yeah, her fault! No, it's not. You're just grumpy because you've been Smoozed. Smooze? What's Smooze? It came from the Volcano of Gloom. The witches sent it. We have to warn the others. What about Spike and Lickety-Split? You keep looking for 'em. Me? Yes, you. I have to get back to Dream Castle. Forget it. She'll never find 'em. I will, too! Yeah, hope, hope. You coming with me? Coming with you? Oh, yeah, good idea. Mm-hmm, good idea, yeah. To Dream Castle, everyone! Gorgeous. Ponyland is turning dark, dank, and dreary! The Little Ponies are doomed! Then we'll be all alone up here. Splendid! We don't need anybody else. Want some? What is it? Stuffed bat wings. Mmm, good. Are you sure we don't need anybody? Mmm. We'll never get out of here. Don't give up. We'll make it. If only I hadn't run away. If only you could fly. Look out! This way! What is it? I don't know. Uh, I hate to say this, but I think we're trapped. Into the castle, everyone! The Smooze is coming! What's Smooze? Will we like it? Is it something nice? I'll explain later. Everyone inside, hurry! Let's go, everyone! Into the castle, quickly. What's happening? I don't know. What's going on? What's wrong with you? What's it look like, Bubblehead? Get me some water, quick! Dump it! The Smooze didn't come off. What's Smooze? You're looking at it, Fizzy. The witches sent it down on us. They should be ashamed of themselves. And there's more coming. Enough to bury us all! I know what can help us and Megan's got it. Where are those ponies going? It doesn't matter, they can't stop the Smooze. Nothing can stop the Smooze! Danny, Megan! Watch me jump! She'll never make it. You can do it, Molly! And smile! She'll probably break the camera. Way to go! By the time Mom and Dad get back, you'll be a champ! Look! Wind Whistler! North Star! You know them? They're My Little Ponies. The ones you told us about? The very same. Megan, time is of the essence. We've come for the Rainbow of Light. The witches from the Volcano of Gloom are trying to destroy us! That's awful! Here, take the Rainbow, but let me go back with you. Maybe I can help. No, Megan. It's our fight. Besides, it's too dangerous. I love danger! And I can ride like the wind! -Me too! -I'm better. We can all help. Perhaps you can. If those witches want a fight, then we'll give 'em one.

Shut up! Way to go, Rainbow! All right! The Smooze got our rainbow! Oh, no! What are we gonna do? The Smooze can't lose. There's something you haven't told me. No, we told you everything. I don't believe you. We wouldn't lie. I told you I don't care if you lie, but not to me! But we didn't do anything wrong! Reeka's right. The Smooze worked without it. Without what? Without what? Nothing. Then eat! Yuck! Eat! No, please! Don't make us eat ice cream! Then tell me why the Smooze lost! Well, maybe there is one thing. -Draggle! -(whacking) Go on. Well, well, well, when we got the stuff to make the Smooze we, uh, uh, we, uh, we forgot the phlume. You forgot the phlume? It was an honest mistake, Mama. What did you call me? Sorry, Hydia. I didn't mean to call you Mama. I'm giving you one last chance, girls! Get the phlume or get a room! The Rainbow of Light is gone forever. Why can't we just dig it out? That's impossible. The congealed Smooze has created an impenetrable shell! I'm afraid we're stuck with it. No, I'm stuck with it, Big Mouth! -Yeah, stuck! -Stuck with it! We can't give up hope! Fizzy's right.

The Moochick's too absent-minded to even remember who we are! We must explore every possibility, every avenue. I'll take you there, Megan! And I'm going with you. Unicorns are good luck. And good company, too. We need more than good luck. You know, maybe we should get a room. Maybe it's time to move out. Get a place of our own. Live with you? I'd rather get the phlume. Well, that's fine with me. There it is! On second thought, you get it! You're taller! You're stronger. It's the phlume or Hydia. What do you want? We'll do it together. I'll stick it, you hold it.

Mr. Moochick! Well, is it your turn or mine? I, I don't recall! Oh, oh, oh, yes, of course, of course! Oh, I never win! Mr. Moochick! Are you in there? That's odd, the Moochick never leaves the safe confines of his Mushromp. I'm sure he's here somewhere. He has to be here. Maybe he's here, but he doesn't want to see us. And who, may I ask, are all of you? I'm known as Wind Whistler. And I'm Fizzy. We're Little Ponies. And I'm Megan. My, my, what a funny looking Little Pony you are, Megan! I'm not a Little Pony, Mr. Moochick! Don't you remember us? You're from outside the Mushromp, right? Right. And the Little Ponies need your help. Not again! You do remember. How could I forget? You gave us the Rainbow of Light. It worked, I presume. It worked great, but it's gone now. The Smooze got it! Do you have another one? Oh my, oh my, no, I'm sorry. I'm afraid there is no more Rainbow of Light. Hmm. Hmm-hm-hm. (tongue clicking) What a shame! And the Smooze covered over Dream Castle, too. The Little Ponies have no place to live!

It's very difficult to stop the Smooze. Maybe even impossible. Oh, but we were counting on you, Mr. Moochick. We presumed you knew everything. I do know everything, my flying four-legged friend. The only ones who can stop the Smooze are, uh... -(thumping) -hmm, are, uh, are um, of course! -The Flutter Ponies! -Phew. Where are they? Yes, well, well, they're not easy to find. Can you give us a clue? Anything! We'll find 'em. Ah, you're in luck! This ancient map will show you the way to Flutter Valley, the home of the Flutter Ponies. But don't tell them I gave it to you.

You've already given us good luck, Mr. Moochick. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye-bye, bye-bye. Hmm, are you sure it's the Flutter Ponies? Maybe it's the singing grasshoppers.

We could put our new dance studio in here. There's enough space down here for a grand ballroom. And we can have our nursery in this room. Hey, there's even a swimming pool! A swimming pool? Yeah, wow, hurray! -Big deal. -Who likes swimming anyways? -Aah! -Tell me, who? The Smooze! It's alive again. We'd better find those Flutter Ponies now! I'm going with you! And me! Don't forget me! I wanna go, too! No, Molly, it's not safe! Safe or not, we're not staying behind this time! We can help! You said so yourself! All right! This is no time to argue. Hurry! The Smooze is coming! Let's ride! They're afraid! They're running away! I want those Little Ponies stopped! Why? What difference does it make? You said nothing can stop the Smooze now. -Get Ahgg. -(gasping) Oh, not Ahgg! -(crashing) -Get him! We'll never find Lickety-Split. No, never. Everything looks like everything else. Yeah, everything. Oh, what if the Smooze got 'em? The Smooze got 'em? Oh no! It's not for sure, bushwoolie. Come on, we have to keep looking. Yeah, yeah. Keep looking, keep looking. What a day! First the phlume, now Ahgg. We have to do everything! -(rat squeaking) -This is it, I mean it! I'm through after this! Hydia can do everything herself! Are you gonna tell her? Don't bother me. Ahgg, you in there? He's in there. We need your help, Ahgg! Please, Ahgg, don't be difficult. Nice Ahgg, here! I baked something special for you! Ahggie likes it. Does that mean you'll help? Is that a yes or a no? I'm sorry, bushwoolie. I didn't mean to make you cry. You cry, I cry! I'm sorry! I'm just sad we haven't found Spike and Lickety-Split. I guess I'm a failure. A failure. Yeah, you failed. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't have to agree with everything I say. Yes I do! Bushwoolies agree with everything. Always, all the time! Yes, we do, yes, yes! Don't you ever have anything to say for yourself? Yeah. Run! Run? Why run? Run! We must be going the right way. There are the giant sunflowers! There's no time to go around them, we have to go through! They're so tall, we'll get lost! Just keep your eye on the sky! I'll get you through safely! Great idea, Wind Whistler! Good thing you came along. We'll make it for sure now! -We'll just-- -Bubble down, Fizzy. We won't get anywhere if you don't stop talking! Sorry! It's just that sometimes I get so excited-- Follow me! Gee, I don't see why a Little Pony can't be enthusiastic once in a while. Straight ahead! You're doing splendidly! Now I know how an ant feels! To the left! You're drifting! Stay close, everybody! How much farther? You've reached the half-way point! Oh, no! What is it? Smooze! Run for it! Get on! That way! Faster! It's coming closer! Megan! Keep going! I'll catch up to ya! Help! Can you jump it, Fizzy? Gosh, I don't think so! I can! Get on! What about Fizzy? Not to worry! I'll just use my unicorn magic! Come on! Hold on! Where's Megan? Here goes nothin'! Help me! I'm falling! Hold on! I can't! Megan! Are you all right? I'm fine, thanks to Wind Whistler. It's easy to be courageous when helping others. Gee, Wind Whistler, that's beautiful. I love the way you talk. Smoozeball coming! Look out! -Hi! -Bushwoolie! We thought you were a smoozeball! What about Lickety-Split and Spike? We can't find them! Oh, Shady, that's terrible. I tried, I really did. We looked everywhere, honest. Yeah, everywhere. Shady tried. I'm sure you did. Now that Megan's here, maybe my Iuck'll change. We're gonna need all the luck we can get. If this map is right, Flutter Valley is that way through a place called Shadow Forest. -Ooh! -Danny! What do you think, King? Dream Castle that way! You sure? Seems to me we've been that way already. What's over there? Smooze! Climb on! Spike, tail Smoozed! It's one of my favorite parts. Oh, Spike. Don't be sad. Not too bad. Maybe I can use it to steer. Nothing else to do with it now. More Smooze! Lean to the right, everybody! Lean! Prepare to go ashore! That was close. We almost went way of Grundleland! (crying) Oh, Grundleland! Must remember not to mention Grundleland! (crying) Oh, Grundleland! Grundlemumf! Gee, if only I hadn't run away, none of this would've happened to me. It bring Grundle King. That's true, but we're lost, your tail's Smoozed, and it's all my fault! If only somebody could help me! (voice echoing in well) Help me! Hey, wait! Maybe you can wish away the Smooze! That's not a wishing well. It can't help. Can't hurt. Go ahead, Lickety-Split, make your wish! Who knows, maybe it'll change things! I don't know, there's an awful lot to change. ♪ No one's in a fix like I am ♪ ♪ I am ♪ ♪ No one has the luck I do ♪ ♪ I do ♪ ♪ No one had the ♪ ♪ setbacks I have ♪ ♪ I have ♪ ♪ Look where life ♪ ♪ has led me to ♪ ♪ Me to ♪ ♪ Nothing I can ♪ ♪ see can help me ♪ ♪ Help me ♪ ♪ And with all that ♪ ♪ we've come through ♪ ♪ Come through ♪ ♪ I wish this was a dream ♪ ♪ so I could wake up ♪ ♪ Wake up ♪ ♪ But what good ♪ ♪ will wishing do ♪ Ah, come on, Lickety-Split, make a real wish!

It's a, what is it? I'm Morning Glory, a Flutter Pony. Who are you? Lickety-Split. I'm a baby pony. And I'm Spike. And I am king of Grundles. We are rest of Grundles! You live in this well? Goodness, no! I stopped for a drink and fell in. My wings got wet and I couldn't fly out. Oh, thank you. What are all of you doing here? Trying to get away from some ugly purple stuff! Smooze? You know about Smooze? Flutter Ponies know all about the Smooze! You help us? Certainly! You helped me. It's only fair! Then my wish did come true! Follow me, I'll take you to Flutter Valley. Here comes the Smooze! How close is it? Too close! It's Shadow Forest, all right. Looks so dark in there. You should've brought your nightlight! Danny! Only kidding. You were not! Over here, I found a trail, hurry! Gee, I finally did something good. Maybe my luck is changing! It's scary in here. Aw, they're only shadows. Don't be such a chicken. What was that? It's only a tree branch. An oak, I believe. Nothing to be frightened of. You bring your night light, Danny? All right, big deal. So I thought it was something else. What, a monster? Come on, you two, that's enough. There aren't any monsters here! But where's here? We're lost, I just know it! We're not lost, Shady. Relax. Oh, oh, here we are! What are all those squiggly lines? I don't know. I do now! Run! Wait! There's no need to panic. Now panic! We'll never make it through the forest! Yes, we will! Fizzy! Fizzy, come back! I wish I could disappear like that! Keep running! (panting) Don't stop! Flutter Valley should be right through there! Look! What a wonderful place! These flowers are the most beautiful I've ever seen! Smell so sweet. I bet Flutter Valley's down the other side of that tall, furry plant. There's no tall, furry plant on the map. ReaHy? Careful, don't touch it. Oh, my goodness! Awesome! It's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. Reminds me of your friend Lori. Does not! Perhaps there's another entrance into Flutter Valley. Not according to the map. Maybe it'll go home. Maybe we should go home. Let's see if it's hungry! Danny! Hey, Uggo, you hungry? See? Ifsgood. Here, go get it! Now's our chance! We can't do it, it's too sticky! Keep trying! Look out! He's coming back! We're stuck! Hurry, please! There! We've gotta get past it! I know! I heard spiders are ticklish! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! -Is not! -Is too! You just watch! It laughed! Hmmph, barely. Start tickling, everybody! The web's falling apart! Keep it up! Goochie goochie goo! I knew spiders were ticklish! That's cause you're my sister! Good work, Molly! Ew, Danny kissed me! There's an opening! Come on! Megan! Help me! Oh, it's unbelievable! I never dreamed anything could be so beautiful! Look at all the Flutter Ponies! There're so many of 'em! But they're not very big. How can they stop the Smooze? Let's find out. Where'd they all go? Maybe they're afraid of us. Maybe they don't want us here. Hello! We're not here to hurt you, Flutter Ponies! We need your help! Up there! I am Rosedust, the queen of the Flutter Ponies. Um, I'm Megan. And these are my friends, the Little Ponies. I heard you say you need our help. Oh, we do, Rosedust! The Smooze! We've been told that you're the only ones who can stop it. This is true, we have that power. Will you help us, then? Try to understand. We wish only to be left alone. Then you won't help the Little Ponies? No. You have to help them, Rosedust. Morning Glory. Lickety-Split, Spike! I never thought we'd see you again! They need our help, Rosedust. It's not our fight, Morning Glory. But it is! It's everybody's fight! Yeah, everybody has to help everyone else! I mean, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for the Grundles! Greetings. Somebody has to stop the Smooze. Please, Rosedust! The Little Ponies are finished! There's no escape this time! It's nearly on top of us! We'll have to make a run for it! We can't! We are surrounded by Smooze! To the roof! Just watch! The Smooze will do the rest. What're we going to do? Everyone, close your eyes. Close 'em. That's it. Now I want you all to think of Megan and Magic Star, and Fizzy and Wind Whistler. Now imagine a sky filled with Flutter Ponies. Do y'see 'em? I don't see anything. Neither do I. I do, I do! What's that sound? It's them! They're coming! Lickety-Split, you're back. Shift to Utter Flutter! Push back the Smooze! It's the Flutter Ponies! My Smooze! Hooray! Get the witches! I'm glad you're home, Lickety-Split. Me too. Fight back, Smooze! Don't let 'em beat you! Come on, Smooze! You coward! Work, Phlume! Do something! It's Dream Castle! The Rainbow of Light, it's okay now! Thank you, Flutter Ponies. Your twinkle is back, Sweet Stuff. Return to the volcano! It's our only chance! You said nothing could stop the Smooze! I lied! Look out! I thought we didn't need anybody else! Is that another lie? Put us down, Rainbow, please put us down! No, don't put us down! Don't do that! Look what you've done. You and your Smooze! Oh, it's all your fault, Mama! This is not my fault! And don't call me Mama! -Mama! -Mother! -Mommy! -Ma! Mrs. Mom! Uh, Rosedust, before you leave, do you think maybe you could, uh, do something about this? Certainly. Brace yourself. I always liked my tail. Thanks. Oh, one more thing. Do you think you could do anything about my friends, the Grundles? I'll need a little help for that. Grundlemumf, what doing? Grundles good. They're trying to take off the Smooze, King. What Smooze? Grundles never Smoozed. Kingdom Smoozed, Grundles not. What you see is what you got. Sorry, King. Well, personally, I think Grundles are not only good, Grundles are beautiful. Yeah, beautiful. Really neat. Grundles good. And as thanks for saving Lickety-Split, we want you to have Dream Castle. You can begin your kingdom again. You mean it? It's yours. We have Paradise Estate now. Grundle king touched. Having new kingdom better than vacation. Good-bye, Little Ponies! Good-bye, good-bye! Bye! -Bye! -Good-bye! You sure gave us a scare, Rainbow. You keep it, Lickety-Split. The Rainbow of Light belongs here, with the Little Ponies. I belong here too. I can't think of a better place to be. Yeah, it's the best. ♪ My Little Pony, ♪ ♪ my Little Pony ♪ ♪ Now comes the time ♪ ♪ to say good-bye ♪ ♪ My Little Pony, ♪ ♪ my Little Pony ♪ ♪ Could that be a ♪ ♪ teardrop in your eye ♪ ♪ No need for sorrow ♪ ♪ Think of tomorrow ♪ ♪ We'll be together again ♪ ♪ My Little Pony, ♪ ♪ my Little Pony ♪ ♪ Hope you keep ♪ ♪ smiling till then ♪ ♪ I hope you keep ♪ ♪ smiling till then ♪
