Hey, Skipper. Ellis here. You better come up and have a look. There's something alongside. - Probably the latest submarine. - 'Be straight up.' Where's this monster of the deep? - It must have come from that sub. - What's happened? - I don't know. - Get some men on that fire! Under attack... submarine. Airborne missiles... look like flying fish. Under attack...! 'Kingston! Kingston! Come in!' I found this place last year on a cycling holiday with my wife. It was good to contrast modern fishing methods with the old. Look at that. Could be back in the 17th century. It's good. Very good. Look at the texture of that brickwork. Hundreds of years in it. Most of those boats are over 50 years old. - Don't build 'em like that nowadays. - No. It's uncanny. These men work purely by instinct. No equipment, just experience handed down from generation to generation. And the amazing thing is that only 2 hours before this, our underwater detector reported nothing in the area. 'Mayday! Mauday! Deep Space Probe 87 calling.' - 'Deep Space Probe 87 calling.' - Control receiving. Come in, 87. '25 UFOs massing. 'Concentrating in area NML-12. 'We've been seen. UFOs approaching. Taking evasive action.' DSP-87, come in! Come in! 87, can you hear me? 87, come in! Wait a minute. What's that? That fish... That's strange. They're only found in the mid-Atlantic, never round our coasts. We've found something here. Have a frame blown up as soon as possible. You'll have to excuse me. I was so intrigued with your picture, I forgot my meeting with the backer of our next film, and I'm very late. - I quite understand. - You have a very good film there. Thank you, Mr Straker. Get an underwater cameraman down there tomorrow. We may have a very interesting new dimension to this film. Deep Space Probe 87 has been destroyed. They saw a build-up of UFOs in area NML-12. NML-12? That's only 4 hours away. - I've alerted all stations. - Good. A mass UFO attack! Our defences will knock them out before they reach earth. - It makes no sense. - Maybe they expect to get through. They know it's not possible, unless they have something up their sleeve. Put Space Observation Platform Watchdog in that zone immediately. Computerize every scrap of information, no matter how small. All this way just to photograph fish which shouldn't even be here. - He must have more money than sense. - If you see any, shoot about 200 feet from about 6 different angles, OK? - Testing. 1, 2, 3. - Loud and clear. 'At least the water's warm.' - Do you see anything? - 'Not yet. Strange.' 'The deeper I go, the warmer the water.' 'Your fish are here, several tropical kinds.' 'Must be this warm water. I can see something else, like a flying fish.' - 'It's large, silver...' - Are there sharks in this area? 'It's turning towards me...' Here, give us a hand. Come on! Give us a hand. It's been cut! - He was photographing fish? - Yes. A mid-Atlantic species, never before found off the coast of Cornwall. Did anyone check to find out about sharks in this area? I did, personally. I was assured that they very rarely came there, and the odd one that did was harmless. But the air pipe was severed? Yes. Very well. That's all, gentlemen. When our investigations are complete, I'll call to discuss the claim. Good day to you. If you'll excuse me, I must go and see his widow. Yes. If there's anything I can do, let me know. Thank you. Lieutenant Anderson, get me Skydiver. Paul. That cameraman said something about a large, silver flying fish. Last week, the freighter Kingston was sunk here in the mid-Atlantic by missiles like flying fish. And the species of fish off Cornwall are normally found there. - You think there's a link? - It's too much of a coincidence. 'Skydiver for you, sir.' Captain, proceed to the area where the Kingston was sunk. I'm having instructions prepared. I'll contact you in 30 minutes. 'This is Space Intruder Detector, 'relaying report from Watchdog.' 'UFOs retaining position in area NML-12.' Take her down to the sea bed. Let's have a look around there. What's the latest on Watchdog? No change. UFOs still in stationary position, sir. What are they waiting for? What does the computer think? With so little information, it's reluctant to answer but it said they're either waiting for reinforcements or non-operation of defences, namely SHADO Control. We know there are no signs of reinforcements, and SHADO certainly won't cease operations. The next batch of information you feed in, add a drop of castor oil. How's the water temperature? 15 degrees higher than the surface. - Still rising. - Maybe the volcano's active? No, we checked that. Get SHADO Control. Yes, sir. 'Skydiver for you, Commander.' Thank you. Yes, Captain? 'We're in the search area.' 'Water temperature near volcano 30 degrees higher than normal.' I see. Thank you, Captain. I'll call you back in a minute. Have Colonel Foster bring in that report on the underwater cameraman. Yes, sir. Thanks. Another link. Listen to this, Paul. "The deeper I go, the warmer the water becomes." - Get me Skydiver. - 'Yes, sir.' Take a look at this, Paul. The deep water around that volcano is a lot warmer than it should be. 'Skydiver.' Captain, using your temperature gauges, follow that stream of warm water. Find out where it leads to and what's causing it. - Report back to me every 15 min. - 'Very good, sir.' Now I have an idea they'll finish up just about... here. - Cornwall. - Yes. - The fish follow the warm water. - Exactly. Lieutenant Anderson, what's the latest on Watchdog? 'Lieutenant Anderson's on leave, sir. 'Last report via SID received 3 minutes ago. No change.' Thank you. Stop engines! - Temperature rise of three degrees. - Captain! Evasive action! - Periscope depth! Slowly. - Aye aye, sir. Good work, Captain. Resume your original search. And Captain... watch yourself. 'Yes, sir.' It seems a UFO is using that volcano as a front door to the Atlantic. Skydiver found the reason for the rise in water temperature. - What was that? - An undersea cable. The UFO was using it as an energy supply. But they can travel underwater on their own power. For short distances. - You think it's been to Cornwall? - It looks that way. Then there must be an energy plant under the volcano. And if the water temperature is so high... it's generating a lot more power than is needed to drive one UFO. Yes. I wonder what Skydiver will find at the end of that cable. Look! - Captain, what's the news? - Nothing, sir. It appears to be completely smooth. - Any entrance? - None we can see. - Let's go and have a closer look. - Dive. Lieutenant. You know Colonel Foster. I think a cup of Skydiver coffee would be just great. Come on, Paul. Let's get our water wings on. After you've dropped us, get out of sight, Captain. We'll rendezvous back here in 45 minutes. Yes, sir. 'Testing radio link.' 'Receiving. Five by five.' 'There it is. 'Take it easy, Paul.' 'I think I've found something. Around this side.' 'OK, Paul, Lead the way.' 'Just here. Could be some kind of porthole or window.' 'It's possible. Try scraping away the outer layer.' 'It's coming.' - 'My God, Paul! It's Anderson.' - 'It can't be!' 'See for yourself. It's Lieutenant Anderson.' What are we going to do? Blow it up? No, I want to find out what's going on in there. - How? There's no entrance. - There must be. I'll examine this. Maybe we can find out what that thing's made of. - What did you see, sir? - I'm afraid I can't say, Captain. You'll find out why later. Take us up. Surface. Stay by that dome, Captain. Report anything unusual. If necessary, but only as a last resort , blast it out of the water. I'll contact you when I get back to SHADO HQ. Very good, sir. - Anything from Watchdog? - Still nothing, sir. I want Anderson's psychiatric analysis right away. - Yes, sir. - Still can't believe he's a traitor. We can't deny what we saw with our own eyes, can we? "Question 1- From Anderson's psychiatric report, "I can find no reason for disloyalty. "Question 2. Without sufficient information, "I can only supply unsatisfactory answers. "Is there any link between the undersea dome and the massing of UFOs in area NML-12? "If there is a link, it can only be connected with my previous answers: A - Reinforcements. Possibly the dome houses UFOs; B - It contains equipment to be used to negate radar; C - It is there to bring about the non-function of SHADO, to allow the UFOs into earth's atmosphere." That's a mass of useless information. I agree. Is there any way, Colonel, of rephrasing the questions? We have asked 12 different ways, sir. Each time, the same answer. - There isn't enough information. - Yes, yes, yes. I'm sorry. Paul, we won't find out anything until we get inside that dome. As soon as the analyst's report has been fed in on my knife, let me know. Yes, sir, we'll do our best. - What are you talking about? - What were you doing in that dome? -I don't know what you're talking about -What were you doing in that dome? - What dome? - The dome we saw you in. We saw you! I've spent the last 24 h at home. - Witnesses? - I told you. I was by myself. What were you doing in that dome? I don't know anything about any dome. There's no sense wasting more time, Paul. Doctor! All right... I was never in any dome, whether you saw me or not. I don't know what this is all about but the answer better be pretty good. - How long, Doctor? - Another 5 seconds. I think I'm about ready. Now, what were you doing in that underwater dome? I don't know anything about an underwater dome. Where have you been for the last 24 hours? - I've been at home by myself. - Did you sleep? - Yes, I slept. - Did you lock the doors? Yes. I locked all the doors. - Why? - There have been burglaries. Have you ever been to Cornwall? Never. Doctor, is there any chance he's resistant? No, no, no. This drug is infallible. Another shot. One more. Sorry. Tell us about the dome. I don't know about the dome. I don't believe it. There's only one way to find out what's inside that damned dome. - Doctor...? - Yes, he'll be all right. Put Lieutenant Anderson under lock and key. 'This is SID. 'The UFOs in area NML-12 are still stationary. 'The estimated number has increased to 50. 'Watchdog maintaining constant observation. "The substance from which the undersea construction is made "is of a molecular structure unknown to us. "The entrance could be made by pressure. "The rupture would be self-sealing." - Thank you, Colonel. - I hope that's satisfactory, sir. Colonel Lake, look, I do understand the problems, and the answers are satisfactory. Thank you, sir. Will you please ask Colonel Foster to get his bags packed? - Captain. - Commander. - Well, let's go down. - Yes, sir. Dive. Sorry to keep you in the dark, Captain. When I tell you why, you'll understand. Lieutenant Anderson is a traitor. He was inside that dome. - Anderson? That's not possible. - I'm afraid it's the truth. Colonel Foster and I are going inside. I've no idea what we'll find, but stay within range. If we're not back in one hour, destroy it. - But... - No buts, Captain. If we're not back by then, we won't be coming back anyway. There's been a UFO. In unknown country, I think it's better to travel light. 53 minutes to go. Well, let's see what wonders await us down here. I handed him over to security less than two hours ago. Maybe they forgot to lock the door. I'll see what he's up to. - I'll investigate. - We've got 44 minutes. I'll meet you back at the equipment in 20. See anything, Paul? Dr Livingstone, I presume. What happened to you? You. Look. How? I guess we'd call it some kind of plastic surgery. - But why? - Ah... That is the question. Anderson. Think what we've done to him. After this we'd better stick together, Paul. Come on. Let's hide it. Let's try this way. As good as any. Ever had that feeling you've been here before? Yeah, sure looks familiar. But why? SHADO Control to SID. SHADO Control to SID. Come in, SID. SHADO Control to Moonbase. Come in, Moonbase. 'Moonbase receiving you, Control.' UFOs approaching from NML-12. Do not attempt to intercept. Repeat, do not attempt to intercept. 'Do not understand. Do not understand. 'You say do not intercept? Is this correct?' Correct. Straker's orders. UFOs to be dealt with by earth's defences. Over and out. 'Do not understand. You say do not intercept?' Correct, Skydiver. Commander Straker's orders. UFOs will be dealt with by ground defences. Over and out. The computer was right. They planned to take over SHADO Control and let those UFOs through. How did they get our voices? They've recorded our communications. By using the words they need, they can make us say anything. Why all this elaborate miming? Don't forget, they will be seen on the TV screens. Come on, Paul. Let's go. Load the tubes. Yes, sir. We'll split up. One of us will stand a chance. OK. First back stops the countdown. No, there isn't time. They're making their move. - Good luck, Paul. - Good luck. 8 minutes. Only another 8 minutes. Captain! Thank God! Did you see Commander Straker? No, sir. 'The massed UFOs are moving out of area NML-12.' 'Must presume attack course.' - Any sign of the commander? - No, sir. - Arm the torpedoes. - Torpedoes armed, sir. Fire 1. Fire 1, sir. 1 away, sir. Colonel Foster! - Fire 2. - Yes, sir. Fire 2. 2 away, sir. 'UFOs now on positive track.' 'Heading for earth at attack velocity in 2 waves.' Message received. Commander, they're on their way. Now. SHADO Control to Moonbase. Attack and destroy second wave of UFOs. Red alert. Red alert. Interceptors, immediate launch. - Skydiver. - SHADO Control to Skydiver. Attack and destroy first wave of UFOs. Understood. We don't know how they knew what SHADO looked like, - or what we look like. - And possibly, we never will. Could have been some form of X-ray photography. At least they won't try that again. Don't bet on it, Paul.
