- Here comes Mrs. Baxter now. Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Baxter! Oh, Mrs. Baxter, I've been wanting to talk to you in the worst way. We've been meaning to invite you and Stanley over for dinner some night. Vicki and I are all alone, you know. I do wish you'd consider it. - You will excuse me. - I don't know what's the matter. I simply can't take the heat anymore. - At our house, it's always the wrong number-- - Oh, as I was saying-- - Good bye, good bye. Hello? Hello? Stanley? Hello? Don't try and get cute with me, Stanley, I know it's you. When are you coming home? Answer me. Stanley, are you with someone? Do you hear me? I know what you're up to, you're not fooling me. I hope you get a good case of the clap, Stanley. Maybe that'll teach you a lesson, smart ass. Stanley? Stanley? Stanley! That bastard. That bastard. That sadistic little bastard. He wants to play games with me. Huh-uh, no sirree. You're not gonna torment me, baby. No two-faced little bastard's gonna give me the royal shafting. - Tino's Cafe, choice Italian food. Yeah? Yeah, I know Stanley. You mean today? No, I ain't seen him all day. Just a minute, hold on. Hey Dolores, there's some old dame on the phone looking for that guy Stanley. You know the one, that thing-a-ling friend of Alma's with the snakeskin pants. Who is this? Oh, you're Stanley's aunt, aren't you? No, this is Dolores. Alma and I room together. Stanley, no, I haven't seen him all day. No, Alma didn't come in to work today. Are you kidding? I don't know Stanley that well. Girls? What girls are you talking about? You're his aunt, you oughta know what he does. Listen, I gotta go, I've got customers. Yeah. Yeah, listen, I gotta hang up, all right? I'm sorry. Good bye. - Hold it, hold it, you can't come inside, you're gonna get me in a lotta trouble. - Yeah, she don't dig me going out with girls. - What's the matter, you tied to her apron strings or something? - You don't have to live with my aunt Martha. - If you don't let me in, so help me, I'll start screaming. I'll wake up everybody in the neighborhood. - You wouldn't do that. Stanley, where's the key? - I don't know, Alma. Come on, chair. - Get up, get on your feet. - Go away, I'm beat. I don't wanna, I don't want to. - You son of a bitch, don't you cop out on me. God dammit, get up. - Oh, Jesus. I thought you were a nice girl. Oh, shut up. Cut it out. - Hey, come on, we're gonna have some fun. Come on, take your clothes off. Go away, I can do it. - You dum-dum, take your pants off. - Okay, okay, big deal. - Hurry up. Stanley! Leave it alone. - Don't be that way. Ow. Cut it out! Calm down, what the hell's a matter with you? Stanley. Come on, take it easy. Come on, oh, poor baby. Come on. - No, no, please get away from me! - Stanley. - Get away from me! - Calm down. - I don't want you in my room! I'm gonna tell my aunt, my, my, my aunt Martha! Paul, Paul! Get away from me, get away from me! - You filthy bitch! Get away from him! - Help me. - You can't have him, he's mine. - Stanley, get her outta here! - Don't you touch him, he belongs to me! - Paul. Get out of my way. - Paul, Paul-- - Take your hands off me! - I need you, Paul. - Let go of me, I am gonna kill that bitch. - Don't let her hurt me, Paul. - You're dead. You're dead! - Get away from me! - You stinking whore! Let go of me! Let go. Let go, let for Christ's sakes, let go! Oh, my God. What have I done? Oh, Stanley. Poor Stanley, come on. I'm sorry, Alma. For what? Poor Stanley. That dirty bitch filled you full of drugs, didn't she? Look at you. Poor boy. Here. I'll pick you up tomorrow, same time? Okay, good bye. - Stanley, breakfast on the table! Stanley! Are you listening to me? That is not a bit funny, take it off! - Cool it will ya, that hurts. You need a broomstick up your ass! - Do you think I like wearing this bird's nest? Do you think I don't feel like an idiot running around town in these women's clothes? - It was your idea, not mine. - And I wouldn't have to wear a disguise if it wasn't for you, would I? I wouldn't have to be panickly every time a policeman passed. I ought to tell them the truth. - I didn't kill Mrs. Johnson! - Yeah, yeah, it was Jack the Ripper! - Jerk. Guess I got in pretty late, didn't I? I remember going to the drive-in. Okay, suppose I did trip out. Look, it's no pleasure living in this house with you. - Well, you ungrateful bastard! Some day, you'll appreciate what I've done for you. - Okay, okay, I'll turn myself in, I'll go to jail. Just lay off the needle, huh? I bust my ass to help you. I sneak you out of Baltimore, I try and keep you out of trouble, I put food in your stomach, and money in your pocket, and that's the gratitude I get. You are in debt to me, young man. You better do a little soul searching. - Wait a minute, I'll go get my violin. You are selfish and, regretfully-- - Okay, okay, don't sweat it! You know, everything I do is wrong! - I have told you before not to drink out of that faucet! - Crabby. - God dammit, don't stand there with the door open, you'll spoil everything in the box. - Crabby. - And I told you to keep this hair short. Do you wanna get us both in trouble? - Quit trying to run my life! The police have a picture of you. - Every newspaper in Baltimore ran it on the front page! - That picture was taken back in high school. - Now, I want you to get your hair cut. I don't wanna see it running down your neck again. - Oh, for Christ's sakes. - All we need is for somebody to recognize you. - I don't care, I'm gonna let it grow out. - You do, and I will shave your head down to your toenails! Jesus Christ. Don't you ever wash that? I mean, that really stinks. You get a haircut today. I'm warning you. Stanley lives with his aunt, over by the golf course. I can give you his address. - Thank you very much, young lady. You've been a lot of help. I won't forget it. - Hey, schmuck. What are you doing in there? - I'm reading the National Geographic. - No, I mean the noise. - I dropped an ashtray. - It didn't sound like an ashtray. Better get yourself a hearing aid. - No, I'm not smoking anything, I just dropped an ashtray. - I want you to get a haircut today. - I'm not getting a haircut today. - I am not asking you, I'm telling you! - I'm not getting any haircut. - Well, we'll see about that. What the hell have you done! Holy Christ! - I want a little privacy. - You psychopath! Move this crap out of here! - Go screw yourself. - Stanley. Stanley! God damn you, Stanley! - Oh, no you don't. - Come on, pussycat. You want to be gorgeous, don't you? - Stay away from me, you crazy nut. Hell's the matter with you? - Oh, God dammit! - Come on. Gonna cut a little cabbage off the head, huh? Come on! Cut it out, will ya? Hey Jerry, what are you doing back here? - Come on in, man, close the door. - You lame brain, you wanna get me in trouble? - Hell man, take it easy, I didn't think you'd mind. Just borrowing the joint for a little party, that's all. - Yeah, it's early, man, but we got hold of some really dynamite stuff. Hey, this is the best stash you'll ever smoke, man. Come on, I want you to meet these two chicks. - Hi. Hi, Dolores. - Oh, you two know each other. - Yeah, sure. I thought she was with you. She didn't come home last night. - I fell asleep at the drive-in last night. Guess she got luck with somebody else. - Hey, I want you to meet Mary Lou. - Hi. Hold it in. - Stanley! Stanley, come down here! - Here, knock yourself out. - Whoa, lift it. - Jesus. I had to work the lunch shift today. Alma didn't show up. - Don't sweat it, baby, live a little, huh? - Stanley. Stan. Hey, Stan. How do you like those goodies? - Oh, wow. Wow, what a rush. Come on, gang, let us groove. - Stanley. - Yoo-hoo! Mrs. Baxter! - Shit. Flowers, for me? Well, you really are a dear. - Get away from me. Come on, stay away. Get away from me! Hey, knock it off, will ya? Hey, come on, man! - Jerry, help me out! - What the fuck. Let's get outta here. - Why don't you tell Stanley come over some evening when Vicki is home? - I'm afraid Stanley is a little shy around girls. Well I thought he'd liked Vicki. They're about the same age. - Tomorrow is Stanley's birthday. He'll be 19. I could fix him a nice cake, and Vicki and I could stop by in the afternoon for a few minutes. - No, no, no, I, I'd really rather you didn't. - Oh, we'll do it on the sly. We'll have a nice party. - Well, it would have to be a surprise. All right. - Now, don't you breathe a word of this to Stanley. - I'll show you out. - Hey, did you ever get squared away with your aunt? She called in here yesterday madder than hell. - Yeah, no problem. Say, listen, did Alma show up yet? - That dumb broad didn't even call in. Don't worry, the kid'll show up. Hey, about that guy over there. He's been asking some questions about ya, says he knows ya. - I don't know, come in off the street. Why don't you go over and talk to him, see what he's doing? - Yeah. Hey, Hubert, what the hell are you doing in Miami? - Well, it got a little cold in Baltimore. I didn't like the heat the cops were putting on me. - Spotted ya driving that crazy bus of yours. - Oh yeah, how 'bout that. Say man, where ya stayin'? - Haven't got any place to stay at all. - I told you, I don't want any more women in this house. What's the matter with ya, you're flipped out or something? This here's Hubert Williams. Hubert, this is my Aunt Martha. Hubert doesn't have any place to go, so I, I thought he might stay here tonight. Come on. Can't you see he's a sick man? - I'll go get some water. He's from Baltimore. Ran me down at Tino's place. Guess he spotted my bus on the street. - Of all the people, he had to pick you up. Is he okay? - I told you that that damn bus was gonna get us in trouble. Come on. Okay, let's get him in the chair. - Hi, I guess I had a bout with the flu. My luck's kinda run out lately. Had a fight with my landlady and she tossed me out on the street. I guess there's a first time for everything. Weren't for Stanley here, I'd be out on the street tonight. I mean, can he stay tonight? - All right. Show Mr. Williams where to sleep. Come on. - I appreciate your kindness, Mrs. Baxter. You won't regret it. - I wanna talk to you. That man knows who I am. - No he doesn't. You have fed me to the wolves. He's a sweet old guy, just a little sick, that's all. - Sick my ass! Did you get a good look at the man's arm? I mean, he's a God damn junkie. That's all we need. - He knows, he knows. I used to go into that drugstore too, you know. - I bet you're wrong. - That old bird's got something on his mind. - I don't know what, but he wants something, and you just wait and see. - Look, there's no use getting all worked up over it. Just stay outta sight 'til he leaves, that's all. - I didn't invite him, he invited himself! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, not all the way from Baltimore he didn't! But I think he knows what happened. He probably even knows the old lady. - Yeah. Oh, they were probably friends, God knows. I think we're in for a lot of trouble. - Oh, shit. I'm sorry I brought him home. What are we gonna do? - A guy like that, a rotten junkie, he'd sell us out for a single fix. - Do we, you really think we're in trouble? What are ya gonna do? - I'm gonna get rid of him. - You mean you're gonna kill him, right here in the house? - I don't know, just, just let me think. It has to be done. You stay up here. I don't want you to come down. I was getting restless waiting for you. - It was so good of you to come downstairs to tuck me in for the night. - Do you want money, is that what you want? - Destiny brought me here, my boy. Destiny and the zodiac. Everything in my life is guided by the stars. Sit down. So you're from Baltimore? - That's right. - The police came around. They asked a lot of questions. That was right after Mrs. Johnson was murdered. - I had nothing to do with her murder! - I'm not saying you did. Quite frankly, I'm not really interested. - I have no place to turn. I'm up against it. And as you can see, I've got to support this bad habit I've acquired. - I need a home, a place to stay. I have no friends. I'm not a young man anymore, and, I don't want to be alone. - You expect me to believe you came here just for that? That's all, you just want a place to stay? - Something to eat, and a place to sleep. - You don't. I'm not exactly a fool, you know. As long as we can reach an agreement, I think we'll get along all right. You see, I don't like the police any more than you do. There's only one thing that bothers me, though. - Stanley. - Nothing happened, at least not yet. We got lucky. - I knew you weren't gonna kill him. Well how did you get so smart? - Easy. You couldn't find a way to pin it on me. Why, you little creep! - Hey! - I told you never to smoke that stuff in this house. - Now, you listen to me. You haven't got any nerves, because you're half stoned all the time, and you're about as reliable as a jackrabbit. Now, I want you to keep a clear head, because you're gonna need it, because that man, Williams, is going to stay here for a while. That remains to be seen. - Oh, Jesus Christ. You can't trust anybody. - Well, you should've thought of that before. Now will you move? I have got to get this out of sight. Who put the chewing gum under here? Will you get to bed? - Man, you're beautiful. You know, one minute you wanna kill me, the next minute you wanna ball with me. Let's ball, Aunt Martha. Come on, Aunt Martha, let's ball. You know, I don't understand you. - Shut up. Do you have to turn the light out? - We are not going to sleep with the light on again, no way, huh-uh. I thought I'd find you here. I have to talk with you. - They're both asleep. Be quiet. Come on with me. - Look, I've helped you, now you've got to help me. - Nobody's heard a word from Alma since yesterday. I'm afraid something's happened to her. I know it! No, I'm worried. - No, nobody. - You expect to find her here, in this house? - One thing I know, she's been with Stanley almost every night this week, and if something's happened to her, I know he's behind it. I see you don't like Stanley. - I can't stand him, he's a freak. I was with him today, and believe me, I know what I'm talking about. - You don't know Stanley. The trouble is, she thinks she's in love with him. - I don't understand you young people. I hope your friend has consulted a good astrologist. - Don't you think we oughta search the house? - No, no, I wouldn't advise that. Now, the best thing for you to do now is to go home. - I'm gonna look around outside, and then I'm gonna call the police. - No, I wouldn't do that, not just yet. Come on, I'll let you out. - I'm gonna take a look around behind the house before I go. - I still think it'd be safer if you went straight home. - It's okay, I can see in the dark. - All right. Come on in. - Hi, Stanley. - Don't see you very out much uniform on ya. Still working out at the hospital, huh? - Yeah, I love it. Another year and I'll be a registered nurse. - Hey, groovy. Guess I won't get to see ya unless I break my leg or something. - Oh, you don't have to do that, Stanley. I only live across the street. - How about that. - Yeah. - Yeah, sure. - Oh, listen, you should... Oh, really? I don't believe it. - Yeah, well see, this kid's old man was a mortician. - It sounds crazy. - Oh, you should've been there, we had a ball. Be honest, you think because I don't go to a lot of parties and smoke pot that I'm really out of it. Well, did you ever think that maybe I just don't care for things like that? - Hey, don't get uptight. I like you. - I like you too, Stanley. - Yeah, okay. - I think you and I could be very close friends. - Yeah, I'm not such a bad guy. Oh, doughnuts, would you like some? - Delicious. - Stanley. I want you to go and clean up in the kitchen. Right now. - I didn't make any mess in the kitchen. Stanley. Don't talk back to me. Do as I say. - Stanley, I just got some new records. Maybe you'd like to come over to the house. - Sounds groovy. I'll see ya later. - Something I can do for you this morning, Vicki? - I came about my mother. - She must be making a nuisance of herself, running over here all the time. - I'm sure she means well. - She hasn't been herself these days. - I hadn't noticed. - She shouldn't be having this baby. - I suppose not. - She got remarried last year. It didn't work out. - That's too bad. - He just walked out. It was a terrible shock to my mother. She's got some crazy notion the baby'll bring him back. - That's nonsense. - Mom's too old to have a baby. I'm worried about her. You know she has a heart condition? - Well, if there's anything I can do, just let me know. - Right now she's baking a cake for Stanley's birthday. - Oh, no, she shouldn't be doing that. - Oh, you don't know my mother when it comes to birthdays. Well, I'd better be getting back to the house. Good bye. - Good bye, Mrs. Baxter. Oh, Stanley! Stanley! Oh, I just don't know. He is really getting to be a problem. - Sit down, I warmed up some coffee for you. - You know, he hasn't been home a single day this week, and I don't know where he goes. - You should make it your business to know. - He's not about to tell me. - No. No, I think he hangs around with a bunch of hippies in the park. Doesn't he have a girlfriend? - Nothing serious. - He's a pretty good looking kid, you know. - He's like a child. - Some women find that attractive. - You know, the sooner we get Stanley out of Miami the better. - Maybe. - I saw the travel folders. Where does that leave me? - You can stay on here. The rent's paid up for a couple of months. He may not like the idea. - He doesn't have much choice. - You're being optimistic. What's the matter? - You little creep! You've been eavesdropping, haven't you? Hm, haven't you? God dammit, pig! Of all the disgusting tricks. I am just about fed up with you. You are going to provoke me into doing something I don't want to do. - Don't you get snotty with me. All right, all right. I'm through, I'm finished, it's all over. - Well that suits me fine. - I don't give a damn what you do, just get out of my sight. Okay, I'll leave. - The sooner the better. - When I'm good and ready. - Go. Okay, I'm going! - Right now, baby. - Give him a couple of days, he'll cool off. - I want him out of this house for good. - I am damn sure. - Well, you know the boy better than I do. May be the best thing after all. - I can see it coming. That kid is going to cause me nothing but trouble. Nothing but trouble. I'd like to ship him out of here in a box. - Well maybe it was never meant to be, the two of you. Stanley was just born under the wrong sign, that's all. - When I think of the crap I have had to put up with-- - I made my mistake in Baltimore, and it's too late to do anything about it now. I'm just going to have to get out from under somehow. Care for a beer? - Yeah, why not. - I hurt Stanley's feelings, I know I did. - Oh, come on-- - You heard what I said. The kid had it coming. Just hurts his pride, that's all. - It's his birthday. - Excuse me. I am going out to have a talk with that boy, because I owe him an apology. - Hi, Vicki! Where have you been? Come on, I'll take you home. Stanley? - Nope, I'm just beat, that's all. I'm sorry I got mad. - That's okay. Doesn't really matter. Where did you and Vicki go? - Just for a ride, that's all. We had a long talk. She's a pretty nice chick. I hope you're not gonna start with her, you know we can't afford to get involved with the neighbors. - Look, she was just being kind to me. It doesn't mean a thing. - I'm sorry I spoke to you the way I did. - Yeah, life is just one big screwup, right? I've been cooped up in that damn house too long. I'm getting mean as a snake. I'm sorry about being such a bitch. I'd like to go back to the house. What do you say? - Sounds groovy. I won't bug you about your hair anymore. I mean, you smell like a brewery. - I only had a couple beers. Come on, Stanley, let's go back to the house. - Okay, Paul. Hey, what's this big lump? - I thought it would be dangerous to leave it lying around the house, especially with Williams up there. it's just a kitchen knife. - This is the knife that you used to kill Mrs. Johnson. - Let me see it. Oh, Jesus, I must've been outta my mind. - That's what I've been telling you. You get crazy when you take drugs, and then you don't even remember what happened. - Well you shoulda gotten rid of the damn thing. Nobody's gonna find it under here. Just don't forget where you put it. - Oh, don't worry man, by tomorrow it'll be at the bottom of the lake. - I wanna go back to the house. - We're not gonna fight anymore are we, Paul? - No, no we're not. We're gonna be considerate of one another from now on. You know I love you. - I'm hungry. You're always hungry. - I wonder where Hubert went. He was here when I left. - He's probably in his room. What have you got there? Stan, Stanley! Come here! Hold his arm, hold the door! I'm gonna get the gun. Stanley, Stanley, he's gonna shoot you too. - Help, help! - Stanley-- - Go, just go, Paul! - Please save my baby. My baby, my baby. - I'm not gonna let you lose your baby. Just try and relax, huh? I'll take you home as soon as you feel better. - Don't let my baby die. - Nothing's gonna happen to your baby. You gotta believe me, I know a lot about babies, I came from a big family. Baby? The baby. - You maniac. - I couldn't let the baby die. - So you took a knife and you opened her up? Is she dead? - Musta been her heart. It's a cute baby. - Oh, boy what a mess! Now we, we have got to get out of here! I shot him! - Well, he better be! Now, come on, let's move! What are you doing? - Well, we can't leave her here. The trunk! We'll put her in the trunk! - Over there, officer, I'll show you. - Come on, let's go. What the hell are you doing? Let's get out of here! - 29-82, send me homicide ME from the crime lab, reference a 45. - Go, Stanley! Get rid of that God damn thing! Stanley! Come on, Stanley! Stanley, for God's sakes, come on! Do you want the police to get us? Come on, Stanley! Stanley! God dammit, save my leg. We've got to get rid of this damn circus wagon. I wonder if the baby's all right. You better worry about your own neck. Do you think the police are after us? Yes, by this time. Well, you didn't have to kill Hubert. - Oh, shut up. We've got to get off of this road. Right now. Stanley, hurry up. Try the door, here! Forget it, let's go, move, move! Hurry up, Stanley! Jesus Christ, dammit. I can't see a damn thing. - It's as dark as, wait a minute, I'll find a light somewhere. Oh, here, wait. They've, they've gotta have some water around here. I gotta find a, and fix up the leg. - Yeah. - And we gotta get the hell out of here. We gotta go down to the pier, get on the ship, and get the hell outta the country. - Um, listen, Paul. Why don't you just go on without me? I'm awfully tired of running. - Hey, it'll be all right. You just relax. I'll take care of it, huh? - Yeah. Hello? Hello? I want the police. Hello? What's the matter with this God damn phone? - You louse. This phone isn't going to work. You see, it's a prop. Get up. Let me turn myself in. Please, Paul. - I ought to blow your head off. - I'll go to jail, I don't care. - Oh, shut up. You're not about to go to jail. - I don't care what they do to me. - No, you dummy. They're not looking for you. They're looking for me. - But, you told me that-- - Forget about what I told you. I would kill that bitch again if I caught her fooling around with you. Now get up. Stupid. Get up. I said, get up. Oh, you son of a... Stanley. Stanley. Stanley! Stanley. - This may be just what we're looking for. Two men just broke into the old studio building on 112th Street. You better get some men over there. The description here fits the two suspects on the APB. - Gotcha. - God damn you, don't move an inch. Yes, that looks more natural. Now for the final touch. - God damn you! - You have done nothing but torment me. - You're choking me. - Come here. - I'm slumming. - Don't do it, no. - You're a character. - Help! - Shut up. Check the other door. - I think somebody's trying to get in the door. - I hope to God they catch you. This is the police! We know you're in there! If you're smart, you'll give yourself up! - Help, help me! Help! - Damn you! Damn you! Damn you. Oh, my God. You forced me to do it. I didn't wanna hurt you. Stanley. Stanley!
