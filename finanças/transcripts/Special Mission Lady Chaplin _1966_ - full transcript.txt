What's happened to the usual sister? This is the Costa Del Sol, phase 2 completed as planned. Proceed with phase 3 immediately. Madrid thinks those monks were industrial spies. But no one can explain how the survivor turned up with a dog tag from the Thresher. The Navy boys say it just can't be Malloy. So, we got to find the whys and wherefores. Well me Thresher wasn't just any old sub. We all know it was an atomic sub and the biggest peace time Navel disaster ever. That doesn't interest us, but the dog tag, how did it get there? Look, lumps of metal don't float up from the sea bed. Well, there's always the chance that somebody tried to get the wreck up. The salvage alone must be worth well over a million dollars. I know, but only one man's got the facility to raise me Thresher. Kobre Zonan, and he wouldn't be interested. Yet, half his money's been made from bringing up wrecks. Oh no! You're barking up the wrong tree and how Malloy. There's a guy you can't suspect. But it wouldn't hurt to ask a question or two. A fortune for bringing wrecks up he must earn as much as may pay us in a lifetime! Our great progress in all branches of science. In chemistry, physics, and in marine biology. Has aroused widespread interest and admiration throughout the whole world. Without the foundation, or more appropriately Kobre Zoltan as our patron this would not have been possible. Commander Heston is waiting in your office Sir. Over the past year, thanks to Mr. Zoltan's generous endowments, we have been able to initiate many new research programs. And make a substantial Zoltan scholarships available to deserving students... Excuse me, I must go to my office for a moment. Thank you. And now ladies & gentlemen Prof. Otto Wagner will read his report on the current activities of our foundation. So we'd like your opinion on whether it would be possible in raise The Thresher? Ah. let me see, as I remember it... the Thresher went down move-or-less here. Am I right? A place where the water is nearly 2 miles deep. Even with modern techniques a recovery would be impossible. Cigar gentlemen? Thanks And then there's another factor, that area is covered with strong submarine currents. Which perhaps you haven't taken into account... and if, as you maintain, the wreck has actually been moved... I would imagine these currents are responsible, it's the only solution. You don't seem convinced. Oh I agree with you... but my superiors dorm... More is the pity. Nevertheless, some strange things are going on in Spain In Spain, I don't understand? Well, nor do we at the moment, but two fake monks were killed... and a couple of days ago a third one showed up at the Embassy in Madrid... and said he had a us Navy dog tag. So what, you might say? It belongs to an officer who went down with the Thresher. He was making overtures, wants to know how much we'll pay him for it. Well I'm not particularly impressed by this secret agent, spy novel type of rubbish. That's your affair gentleman. But be responsible before you pay for this tag... that's my one suggestion. oi as you might say ii will be like using my own money. But, then, you have no idea how much I pay in taxes. I often wonder how big America would have grown without income tax. Excuse me... Barry, the cars ready, I'm leaving in four. I have to be in Spain tonight, I'm sorry I couldn't be of any more help. Now I must leave you to your mystery and get back to my realities... But I'll be glad to see either of you any time mat I'm here. Well then. goodbye Commander. Yeah. it's been my pleasure. Goodbye. Bring in the Madrid file. What's on your mind? Oh, I'm just wondering, why a rich man like Zoltan would go on working. It was the will to work that made his fortune. It's not only that, he's also in love with power. I know the type, meanwhile he's off to Europe, another woman. another life. You seem to like Europe, 50 how would you like to spend a while there? How about Madrid? Then Zoltan didn't take you in either? You've dreaming Malloy. I'm far more concerned on who shot those monks and why. And I want that dog tag, remember? Hello handsome. Hi. Listen. He's one of the corredores, the one on the IE“. Sure hope it's worth 5,000 bucks. It's worth the risk at least. He's wounded, get an ambulance! Did you get hurt? No nothing, but that lot won't talk any more. You oughta send someone to the bull plaza. What about our man? Well it's touch & go for the moment, but the doctor told me, he'll be alright. He's at the Anglo American hospital under police protection. Well Doctor may I question him Of course Inspector, but I'm afraid you'll have to wait an hour or two... until the affect of the shock have worn off. Eh, it has to be sooner than that I have me American embassy on my neck and... I cannot take the responsibility at this stage. Yes of course... I know that... No Inspector... Doctor! Your wife's on the telephone. Excuse me. Of course. See you later Can I help you? You are very kind young man, but I can manage, thank you. I know what you're thinking, but I do have a license. Here let me do that. I'm very sorry, did you hurt yourself? No. It's nothing, just a scratch. Sorry, you can't go in. The Commisario's orders. If you'll check with your... Just a minute! It is 87. Dick Malloy, correct? Yes, but I... I don't know how to explain this. You wanted to interrogate a man, and he's just been killed. Killed, how? Well, it beats me how it was done Malloy. Somebody knocked out the guard at the door and shot him. I suppose you think we're just a bunch of babies. But my men have cordoned off the hospital. Nobody is allowed to leave, until we catch the killer! What about the old lady in the wheelchair? You suspect her? Well that went alright Constance, he won't talk now. Fine! Though I should have caught him with the other two in the monastery. The police will be here any moment. I can't wait! Is Sir Hillary booked in? Yes. He wanted to talk with you right away. Hold him you were busy with last minute style change. Good, we mustn't waste any time What's that scratch? On it's naming, find a dressing would you. It will be easy to spell it. Not many Rolls Royce's in Madrid. Si... Oh... Bueno. What is it? They have found the car! Where? In front of the hotel Luc Palacio. Insp. Soler is already on his way there. Well I want to arrive without too much publicity. You're the boss! She's in this room? Stand back you two... Alright this is a... Heh. Inspector? Is there anything we can do for you? Maybe you just wanted to wish my mother a happy birthday, please do! No... Uh... Yes... You're right. Ah, happy birthday Comessa. Now you must excuse me, it's most important that I find this murderer of the Americans. Are you alright? Ah, no. I'll find my own way om. My apologies for having disturbed you in this way. Have you found her? Oh yes, it wasn't too difficult, since you gave me such a perfect description. Well? Well nothing, but she's only the mother of my most important superior! Hmm. I wonder who though that up? I wouldn't know who thought it up. It will be along time before I live all of this incident down, you know. Perhaps you'll mind your own business in the future Malloy. Good day My you. Just a minute. Eh! I only wanted to say I'm sorry. The people here today. Arabella my dear. Thank you for those lovely flowers. Contessa. Are you going to see our Show? Oh yes, I've managed to persuade my son to take me down. The clothes you design are always so beautiful. Why thank you Comessa... They're waiting for us Arabella. Boy. Señor? Who's mm blonde there? Oh that's Lady Chaplin. She's the owner of Arabella's fashions, me ones who are giving the show. Thank you. Señor. Telephone for señorita Constance Day. Telephone for señorita Constance Day. Who's that man over there. do you know? Yes I ran into him at the hospital, it looks... Señorita Day, me telephone. I'll be right back. Arabella. Morrenito and the other 3 are all dead! Dead? Yes, they were just found in the Plaza. Now shall I go fetch Sir Hillary? No, maybe it will arouse less suspicion if I go over there. Is it all set? I'm afraid it's impossible... there's no way... Can't be done. You mean you don't want to do it? Exactly, you really can't expect me to risk it, it would be suicide. I suppose you wouldn't like us advising the authorities about that money you owe them'? Now Listen. What we are offering can't be sneezed at. Be realistic! 10000 Sterling is more than enough to get you out of those money troubles you're in. I know. Arabella, when do you want it? You're a wise man. in four days alright? I won" have time! If I were in your shoes, I'd find the time. Be seeing you. Glad to meet you Lady Chaplin. I'm sorry to break in on you like this. Can I offer you these? How interesting. Who are you? A fashion expert who's interested in your models. If that's really so, this is the wrong place to talk business. And now would you please leave my room. Well ok. I was hoping to invite you out to dinner. to talk business. Or would something stop you from going? I'd have several reasons for refusing. Including this scratch I did with a needle. It's infected you see and quite painful. Now are you going or must I get someone to Wow you out? No, no. I was just leaving. But first I want to settle something, and I'm sure you won't stop me. How dare you! Quite a woman. all the way down. And not as I thought, old and honey. And certainly not paralytic. We must keep that dinner date some other time. Get me 2-3-4-6-0 23460 ..that's the Villa Daphne isn't it? Just a moment. hold the line. Uh, my telephone... It's ringing. The phone in my room is giving me trouble. I'll have it checked Sir. Has Lady Chaplin tried to call me in my room? No señor, she's only put through one call in me last hour. Oh, where was mm to? Luz Palacio. The Villa Daphne And would you know where (his villa is? It's along the Carretera Colonia señor. Oh. Is that far from here? No señor. Well, if you call my room now, you can check me telephone. Si Señor. Luz Palacio... yes? I didn't get his room number. Arabella, I was looking for you. Shall we go and get something to fortify ourselves with? Kobre is staging one of his fights this evening. Thought I must confess I don't enjoy watching it. Here you are, let's go and sit down. That Genghis Khan of yours ain't gonna make it this Mme Zonan I'm not sure. How much will you bet? I'll lay you five grand. It's a deal. You are a little boy at heart Kobre. They are favorite animals of mine. I have great respect for them. Perhaps that's because I was born under me sign of a scorpion. But aren't you afraid of them? No, very much the opposite. I always have them with me, they bring me good luck. Genghis Kahn won again. Want a return match? Hell no, I've had enough of that little killer of yours for one night. Hold it Ivan! If I'm not mistaken, we've met before. Yeah, in New York with my boss Heston from the CIA. So it was, but the last time you had the good manners to make an appointment. It's just as well I know how to take care of myself. Otherwise your watchdog here would have murdered me. And Heston is waiting for me NJ call. I perfectly understand. I'm sorry about what happened. But you see I have many secretes in my laboratory which I have to protect. Pretend it never happened. You know what I mean. Come on inside. The directress of my fashion house, Miss Arabella Chaplin. But of course, we met a short time ago when you were studying my new models. That was just a means of meeting a beautiful woman. Didn't you tell me outside that Heston was waning? Oh yes. for my call, may I use your phone? Of course you can, go right ahead. Oh yes, and give him my regards. Go on Malloy. Hello? Malloy! Where the hell are you? Whatcha talking about? Zoltan's? You Mad? Yes I've information which may help us find that submarine. Look Malloy, before you come up with any more of your crazy notions, you'd better listen to this, the Thresher's been located. Now catch the firs' plane back here. Oh the seabed where it was in the first place. Get me? What? What's that? Well, Heston says they've found the Thresher. They have? It's very possible... it was moved by one of those currents of yours. Well that's what I told you before, but you don't seem happy about it. Of course I'm delighted, but I... Well perhaps it will cheer you up to meet my guests, you already know Arabella. You are very kind Zoltan, but perhaps some other Mme. There may not be Another. If that's what you think you are in for a surprise. I was looking forward for that date that you mentioned. Then don't forget it, because there's always another time, unless of course... Unless of course? You've Changed your ideas about me by then? How could he possibly have singled you out? Pure chance. Almost everything you can control but not destiny though. Too bad. Nobody's destiny conforms to a pattern. But I'm afraid in Mr. Malloy's case, I could probably make a prediction Navy van a sonar test on the wreck and mars enough for me. There's no possibility it isn't there! Well, it could always be some other wreck? But don't you understand? It's been proved beyond doubt in spite of your hallucinations. And you're going to tell me what happened to my car was another hallucination? Well maybe this will change your mind. I found ii in Zoltan's laboratory. If you drop it in water it swells up into a spongy mass, incredibly light for it's volume. And that's how they raised the Thresher. Now you listen to me Malloy. I suppose you'll be telling me next they raised it using bubble bath. How (he? No strings, no mirrors, no water wings! Amazing. You'd better get that stuff analyzed and find the formula for it. Imagine what would happen if somebody filled the Thresher with it. Moving it would be about as easy as kicking a football. Hey come back here, where do you think you are off to? I have an appointment with an old friend of mine. He's got a bathascope he uses to study marine life. Oh one thing. I'll pay him with the money I should have used to pay for this. I know you won't mind if I borrow it. So long chief. I've shut the hatch. Shall we go? This will give you some idea what the wreck of the Thresher looks like. I photographed it over a year ago for your government. A close-up of the hull, of course the damage was quite considerable. Look at the cracks on the fore-deck. No, I'm afraid it's ludicrous to believe somebody could have raised the Thresher. I promise you, I'll be the first to celebrate if were wrong. You're what an Englishman would call A doubting Thomas. Malloy. Should be right beside her. The U.S.S. Thresher. I'd like to have a look around. You can't go out there. The enormous pressure would crush you flat, flatter man a sword. However... What? There's my telesound, I use it for all thy underwater exploration where I need a more maneuverable craft. Well come on let's have a look then. Now you will see right inside the hull. It's all in black and white of course. Those missile bays should all be filled. Yes, as far as I remember they were, the last time I came down. Perhaps you would like a closer look at them? That's the missile silos of the sub all right and may-ye empty. Every single one's been emptied. Sixteen Polaris missiles with nuclear warheads. What fools we are. We thought they might have stolen the Thresher, but not that they made off with the Polaris missiles. What's 'hat? Yeah. You heard me all right. While we're sitting down here, somebody's got all those Polaris missiles. Fantastic firepower! What can we do? Well there's nothing we can do down here. We'll have to go up, and quickly. Hello... Hello? Johanson here. go ahead. We're ready to surface new, prepare the divers as usual. Shall I have them lower the grapple? Of course! Hey look. Huh? It's Johanson, mon dieu! But I just Spoke to him. Wait, if there's something wrong we mustn't let them realize we caught on to it. Can I get out of here before we surface? The submarine escape lock. You'll find a belt filled with depth charges on the wall, And a micro-respirator for your air supply on your right. I'll stand by just below the surface. Mom impressive. But they might just as well still be in the Thresher at the bottom of me sea. Moving them now would be far too much of a risk. You agreed to accept delivery on board, so that, is your problem. I might remind you the agreement was made before me Americans found reason to investigate you. endangering me project. It doesn't matter, as long as they only worry about your private affairs. But our preoccupation the apparent lack of security. Then it is an unnecessary preoccupation. However. Alright. If that's what you want... The missiles will be handed over at. Zania. Well why not make it... Wait! One moment. I intend to move this Ship for the time being. And anchor it along the coast' somewhere. What are you trying to say? Hmm... Nothing... I have every respect for your government. But I also know that you have secret agents. People who'll do anything. At the beginning of this affair we had to make arrangements for three of them. Most unfortunate incident. I think we've finished down here. In our original agreement, you were also contracted to provide a certain supply of Nitroglynadine. Was right. The propellant. It's quite possible I... I won't be able to keep that part of the agreement. Well do your best, you agreed to hand if over in Paris. Hmm, well. If that's how you want it. I'm very precise my dear. And so am I. Don't forget. See you in Paris. You will be contacted by Lady Chaplin. Yes, she will arrange lo meet you. Our friends just arriving. Well now. Everything ready? Yes everything's ready. Goodbye. Delighted to see you miss Chaplin. Shall we be getting along? Leave me Jeep mere. They're going inside now. Good. The propellant is in the green wagon at the at the end there. Which is ideal for what you have in mind. It's been packed in strengthened steel cases. Are they sealed in a special manner mesa cases? The duty guards are in the carriage the second from the end. There's also a relief detail further up the 'rain. But they won't take over 'till Dover. So that allows adequate margin. The relief detail travels in the first carriage. At precisely 10:20, the (rain will pass the points and at all cos's you must have everything ready then. Otherwise I can't help you. I know you won't let me down, but I'm throwing away my career for this. And it's absolutely vital... That I get paid in cash on Monday. Let's synchronize our watches. And Malloy? There's no need at worry about him my dear. He obviously knows the risk that he's running. The risk that if he gets too Close I might be tempted to use that firepower. And that is why he won't act as long as I have the missiles. I could destroy a whole continent... with me up of my finger. Just like 'hat. And if he stumbles across them? He hasn't... Got “me to... No one... including you, knows where I've hidden them. And when the missiles and the propellant have been delivered to the customer, what could be proved against me? You understand? I think so. Time is our only worry now. That's all. Here here. look at (his dolly. Good evening miss. So sorry boys, I must have the wrong compartment. Nu nu, you mustn't run away, there's men“, of room Come on in. There you are mate. Mind if we shut the window, it's so cold in here. What a fortunate mistake you made. Shall we have a whiskey captain. I say, didn't we meet last fall in the interservices hockey match? May I have some soda in mine please? I'm sure it was there. Well. did you have a good journey? It would have been better, if it hadn't been so drafty. Documents, Visa and a plane ticket to Brazil. Satisfied? Will you come to the airport? It would be pointless Hillary, so I'll say goodbye now. Bon Voyage. Bon jour, monsieur. Bon jour. We'd like an American perfume, what do you have? You want our import department monsieur, if you step this way. Perfumes, toiletries! You got anything to report yet, any news of that fuel? There's not a Sign of it but London just telexed they're sure it is here in Paris. If that's the way it is sweetheart, I guess I wasn't brought here just to see you. Have you ever seen this man, he was head of Britain's missile research. Yes, now where was it? In Madrid with Lady Chaplin. He just spent a weekend in me morgue. Then why don't you go and arrest Lady Chaplin right now? She happens to be a French national in France and an American couldn't arrest her.
