Jefe. We got them. They're here. Take the men to the room. It's okay, sweetie. Your daddy and I just need to discuss some business. Are you hungry? You want a soda? Take them inside, give them whatever they want. Let me know if Alvaro tries to send any more men. Only film them. Yes, boss. What are your names? What cartels are you affiliated with? And what do you do for them? Oh, everyone breaks. You may as well make it less painful on yourselves. Matteo Bastille. I'm a recruiter for the Alvaro cartel. Luis Gomez. Alvaro cartel. I'm a hawk. And tell us what a hawk does? I kidnap people and I take them to my boss. And then what? Speak. I torture them for information. And then... I kill them. And how do you kill and torture them? I stick them in a trash can... and then I burn them alive. And what kind of people do you torture and kill? Our enemies. Does that include women and children? Sometimes, yes. Ah! Puta! Hmm? And what about you? You get off on hurting women and children too? No, I don't do that. Why were you pendejos in here? To kill you. Looks like you assholes fucked that up pretty bad. Eh? Why did you bring your wife and child on a fucking hit? I was... I was going to go on a vacation afterwards. Isn't that some cocky fucking shit. This pinche pendejo thought he was going to come, take me out, and then go on a vacation and drink margaritas. Puta. Yeah. I'll bet you think I want to know everything about your boss. But I don't. We'll always be at war anyway. I'm using you cocksuckers for a different reason. I need the world to know who I am, and why I'm different than you pendejos. Don't hurt my family. Smile for the camera, motherfucker. My friend will drive you both to the bus stop. Buy her something nice. He told me to tell you... that he loves you very much. No. How did it go? As planned. Oh... So... I spoke to my dad. And? He wants to come stay. I want you two to get along, mi amor. Please. He doesn't get what I'm doing here. I know. But the two of you just need to sit down and talk and get to know each other. For me. I'll let you do things to me. Goddamn, woman, you know how to get me. Ay! This pregnancy is crazy. It's got me so horny. So you are going to let him come stay? Okay, okay, he can come stay. Thank you. Thank you, mi amor. Thank you. Is he kicking? Where's the tape? Yeah, good. Want me to drop it off? Nah, not yet. I'm going to show you how it's done. What you got, jefe? The border crossing south of Laredo hasn't been checked in over three months. No drones and no surveillance anywhere, which means I can widen the opening and ship twice the cocaine right through it. I just need you guys to give me a chance to show you what I can do. I like you. You remind me of myself. You got that... He's got that sparkling thing in his eye, no? He's like a younger version of me. Yes. Like an annoying American version. Eh? I didn't realize we were in the business of hiring more gringos. Hey, it's got nothing to do with Mexican or American. It's got everything to do with profit, and done in a smart way. You want to talk about smart? Then tell me, why are you the only narco who sends their cash over the border on flatbed trucks? Have I been caught yet? Hmm? Have I? Any day now, eh? That's no way to talk to an employee. Hey, look, how much money have I made for you in the last year? Two hundred and ten million and some change. Look, are you going to send me twice the cocaine or not? Eh? I say yeah. What do you think? We have always made a slow, calculated steady rise in profit. Too much too soon is bad for business, eh? Que, no. Hey... Pendejo. Sorry, hermano. But me and my brother have to agree on everything. So if he say's no, then... the answer's no. Fucking small-minded bullshit. Stupido Roberto, always pretending like he's looking out for me, and then... Fuck. I made them all this money, and now they want to keep me down like this. Fucking asshole. Vámonos. - Hey. - Yes? - Drop it off. - Sí, jefe. Papi! Como ta, I missed you so much. I missed you so much. Pedro. Erik. Papi, how was your trip? Oh, it was long, mija. Yeah. Think of this as a confession. And I'm your priest. And what about you? You enjoy hurting women and children too? How... How did they get that video? I may have had a little birdie drop it off. Any why would that little birdie drop it off? Because it's time the world knows who I am. Fuck the Alvaros. That's what they get. Hey, Papi, hermanos Uncle Carlos can rest a little easier now, eh? I don't know. I'm-I'm surprised. Back in the day, we would never... invite the police or the press into our house. That was back then. It's a whole new game these days. It looks like the same game to me. Papi, you must be exhausted, okay? Come on, let me show you to your room. - All right, mija. Come on. - Bien. Sí. Now what exactly is my charming little American trying to do? What do you mean? Your stunt. It's bringing all kinds of unwanted attention to us. Oh, come on. You know the cops don't care if we kill each other. That may be true, but that kind of message is making out allies in the... federales a little bit, um... jumpy. Plus, they still got to deal with me and Alvaro. And he can't know that you and I are allied in any kind of fucking way. But between you and me... I fucking loved that video, man! Whoo-hoo! Fucking watching those motherfuckers cry and scream for pathetic pinche lives, and then you pull it out, and boom! You blow their fucking brains out! It was fucking art! Pure, violent, poetic fucking art. I almost creamed my fucking shorts when you did that. Fuck, yeah, hermano. Hey, listen, man. Why don't you reconsider sending me double the coke, man. Come on, Roberto, you know I'm good for it. I'll tell you what. if you can keep this a fucking secret from Juan, fuck it, let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. But the first one has to be successful, okay? And then we tell him. Juan never says fucking no to more money, bro. Okay? Fuck, yeah, Roberto. That's what I'm talking about. You won't regret it. - I won't let you down. - All right. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Come here. - Dominic. - Yes, boss. Hook up the VIP room. It's time to go celebrate. - Erik. - Monique. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you too, amiga. Mm. You guys all ready for some fun? Perfecto. My boys are thirsty. - Ah. - Vámonos. Vámonos. There we go. Girls. Lolitas. Buenas noches. ¿Cómo estás? Vámos. Jefe? Is it okay if I invite my sister? - Liza? - Sí. Of course. I love her. Bring her in. - Gracias, jefe. - Totally. Hey, want some X? - Jefe. - Hey, what up? Hey! - Hey. - Good to see you. - Liza. - You too, boss man. - Thanks for letting me in. - Pleasure. Enjoy. Hey, puto. You got it, hermano. Chilly Willy. Oh, shit. I got to get me some of that. Jefe. - Chilly Willy. - Hey. Shit look at her. She went right in. Get it, girl. Hey, what are you waiting for? Hey, I want to, but... I'm scared of diseases. Don't be stupid. Wear a condom, man. Come on. Go have fun. Yeah, but that's not going to stop the "ghonafifilis." The what? The ghonafifilis. It's a new stain of gonorrhea and syphilis. Look, my little cousin had it last year. He had to get half his dick cut off. I seen it. Look, man, he had a half a knob. That shit was ugly. I don't want that shit. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, but if you don't go out there and have some fucking fun, I'm going to fucking kill you, cabrón. Go out there and have some fun. Sí, jefe. Go, have fun. Hola. What's your name? How are you? I'm going to sit over here first. That's impressive. Does he always stay out all night? Papa, don't. He should be home taking care of his family. That should be his priority. It is, and he does. He takes great care of me, and you will see if you just give him a chance. Oh, sí, give him a chance. Mami. - You good? - Yeah. - You need anything? - No, no. Just enjoying the time well spent. Mm, good. That's good to hear. Listen, I just wanted to say... I really respect what you did back in the day. We all heard the stories. Did you guys eat yet? - No. - No? Oh, Pedro, you're in for a treat, hermano. Willy. Eh, boss. - What's up? - Come on. Make us some of your chilaquiles and famous chilies en nogada. - Okay, boss. - Get in there. Get in there, get in there, get in there. Willy's the best damn cook I ever met. Including my mother. Don't ever tell her I said that. Ah, thank you, boss. Hey, where did you learn how to cook like this? Oh, my grandma. Nothing more important than family. Sí. They will always give you their loyalty. It's one of the many things I love about your daughter. The way I raised her. In the business we're in, loyalty goes a long way. Behind every king... is a badass, smart, strong queen. And don't you forget it, motherfucker. Reminds me a lot of my mother. She always supported my father, no matter what. Never forgot that. This crew, where did you meet this crew? It all started with Dominic. And then I took in Willy as an orphan. And then this one. Seems to be a recurring theme in my life. Maybe they should call me the king of the bastards, huh? That's messed up, jefe. To family. - La familia. - La familia. - Familia. - To the one you are born into... and to the one you choose. Salute. - Salute. - Familia. Salute. Look in my eye, man. Eyes are too pretty. He don't want to look at them. Hey, boss, picking up Roberto's shipment. We're on time. On my way to the boys at the drop. Okay. Don't fuck this up. It's important. I won't let you down, jefe. Sí. It's me, boss. We got a problem. Come on. And they run. Get the fuck out. The entire shipment? Everything was normal. The guys were on point and ready to cross, and just like that, behind us, three cars, police. Mexican or American? Mexican. Someone from this side tipped them off. Who else knows about the crossing? No one. Hmm. Only the Feliz cartel. You think it was Juan? It's too coincidental that our first shipment gets busted. Nah. Roberto's been keeping it a secret from him. I need you to find out who the fuck ratted us out. Jefe, what are you going to do about the Feliz brothers? I appreciate you coming to tell me face-to-face. Most narcos would just lie about it. But I have to say, this isn't a very good start to our new endeavor, mijo. I know. Juan's going to lose his shit. But here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to give you three days to find out who the fuck sold you out. And then... I tell Juan. And if I don't find him... then what? You already know the answer to that. Even if I pay for it? This isn't about the money, mijo. It's about trust. And if we can't trust you to deliver... then we are not really business partners. And if we are not really business partners, then... what are we? I get it. I really do hope that you pull this through. Who do you think sold us out? I don't know yet. But I think it's someone in my organization. I believe they'd do that before they sell out to another cartel. Tell him what you did when you had a rat. It's not my place, mija. No, no, please. Any wisdom you can share. You know, with the Bastille cartel... we tried to keep loyalty tests simple at first. Leave some expensive jewelry, some cash, where they could find it. See how long it would take them to return it. Even if you suspect somebody might not be loyal, you put a bullet in that motherfucker's head. That way, everybody knows you mean business, and nobody pulls that shit again. You raised one hell of a firecracker. I love it. Do you, uh, have any suspects? Even those closest to you. Three. Well, I know the most effective way to find out if somebody is working for the police in your organization. Because there's one thing that separates us from them. And what's that? Killing innocent people. - Jefe! - Chilly! I'm so fucking disgusted right now. Do you want to know why? Because I just came down to the sickening conclusion that one of you pinche pendejos is the rat. - What are you talking about? - Shut the fuck up. It was only the two of you and Officer Perez that knew about the shipment. I'm going to find out who the fucking rat is tonight. Willy, call Officer Perez. And we're starting with you. Get your fucking ass in there, Dominic. Sí, jefe. Give me your gun. ¿Qué pasó? If you're truly loyal to me... and you're willing to give up your life for our cause, you'll blow her brains out. I thought we didn't kill women or children, boss. Ah, but this one's different. This woman manipulates men and tricks people for Alvaro. I've been looking for her. Do it. Do it. You don't do it, you know what happens. You ice-cold motherfucker. - What the fuck? - I knew you were loyal. Give me that. No hard feelings, eh? It's just business. Entendo, boss. Go get Sebastian. Sí. Shut the fuck up, pendejo, huh? Hey, you're doing good. Next time maybe a little bit more shaking. More fear. Qué pasa, jefe? This girl is your enemy. Shoot her in the head. - But she's a... jefe... - Fucking do it, pendejo. I just gave you an order. You sure? Pendejo, I'll put a fucking bullet in your head myself if you don't fucking do it. Do it. Fucking do it now, cabrón. All right. I'm sorry. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Ooh! Hey! What the fuck? You're good. You're good. You're good. I love you, hermanito. I knew you were solid. Hey... Take the rest of the day off, okay? Go home. - Gracias. - All right. Good job. You passed, eh? Good job. Good job. What is this all about? I've never betrayed you. Why I'm going to start now? You tell me. I have no idea who sold you out. I swear on my life. Prove it. How? Paint that wall with this bitch's face. No. This is not what I signed up for. If you don't do it, I'm going to kill you and that pinche pendejo brother of yours. Who paid you to sell me out? I can make this quick, or I can go get Chilly to get the chain saw. It's your choice. Who paid you to sell me out? Eh? Juan Feliz. What about Roberto? I don't know. You pathetic rat motherfucker. No... Maria? Maria? Hey. Sorry you had to see that, huh? Here, I'll pay you double. Maria? You didn't see nothing here today, okay? Sí. Sí. Okay, go. Speak. I found the rat. And who was this piece of shit? One of my lower rank men. He's a nobody. What was his name? Why does it matter? There's a reason my brother and I have stayed on top for as long as we have, cabrón. Information is key. What's his fucking name? You're going to have to trust me when I tell you I've handled it. Are you trying to create doubt in my mind? No, of course not. Then I'm gonna need a motherfucking name, pendejo. I won't ask again. Sebastian. Sebastian Montoya. I put a bullet in his eye last night. Good. Send me his fucking head. I can't. I burned him alive. I thought you just said you shot him. I did. Then I lit his ass on fire. That's one of my favorites too. I'm still going to expect a full payment from you by the end of the week. In cash. Yes, of course. And Erik... if this happens again... I know. I know you know, cabrón. Saturday there's a dinner party at my house. You better fucking be there, bro. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. Yes. Andale. Hey, boss. Sebastian and Willy secured the package. We're good to go. Okay. I'll come get you. You whistle, man? Chilly Willy. Let's go. Don't move. From now on, your new name is Pico. I don't ever want to hear the name Sebastian again, including your sister, got it? Just fucking do it, cabrón. Vámonos. Odelay, Pico. Damn, this is definitely all the fuck way out here. If I give up a whale, I'm going to expect the DEA to give me immunity. Deal? That all depends on the kind of whale we're talking about. The Feliz brothers. Then I do believe the DEA will accommodate your needs. Good. Get back in the car. One question. You played football, drank beers and had a high school sweetheart, didn't you? What's your point? Something I've always wondered ever since you got onto my radar. Why would a handsome, smart kid from Laredo come down here and do all this? What, trying to relate to me now because we were both born in America? We're not all that different. Just the flip side of the same coin. I'm genuinely just curious. You expecting some sob story of child abuse? You won't find one. I come from plenty of love and support, but it didn't matter. My parents never saw me for what I am. And what's that? A motherfucking born gangster. Now, get back in the fucking car. I'm curious. How'd you get your start? My older brother was... dealing weed to a neighbor of mine. You know, just shits and giggles. Marijuana, and then he... My neighbor wanted some coke. And my brother was lame. He didn't... He didn't know anything about coke, you know? And so he gave me the job. I found a good coke connection, but he didn't want to get up off any product, so... I ended up having to stab him. And the rest is history. You? Yeah, I started selling weed in high school. I got busted. Didn't want to face the charges. Came down here, never looked back. Man. Shit's way different these days. Nah, nothing's changed. It's all the same. Of course it has. Technology has changed. Everything is smarter and faster. Yeah, yeah, all that shit changes... but people don't change. We're all the same, human beings doing whatever they do. So, what's your point? Where does it end? Who says it will? You're smarter than that. You know this can only end in death, institutions or insanity. Not for you, it hasn't. I'm in my own prison. Yeah? How so? Hmm! Are you kidding? Fifteen years on the run. Living from motel to motel, out of suitcases. Sitting in a restaurant watching everybody who walks in, wondering if this the vatos gonna kill me. When it happens, you'll see it coming. Death is not going to come. How much you want to bet that within three weeks, I'm going to double up my men, and I'll be sitting at the head of the Feliz cartel. Boss, Roberto Feliz is here. Go back to sleep. Go back to sleep. What is it? Hey? What a nice surprise. How'd you know how to find me? I have a GPS up your ass, cabrón. Come on, I want to take you somewhere to see something. - Where? - It's going to be a surprise. Get out of here, no, no. I want to take you to a special place. I think you guys should have some breakfast. Juan's pissed at me because I told him after the fact. But you know what? He's willing to forgive you, because he knows that you found out who the rat is. It's okay, we get to do some bonding now, right? Two brothers. Man, all bullshit aside... nothing enrages me more... than betrayal. Never forget the first day I tasted it. I was 12 years old in Guadalajara with my dad. Pulls up into some shitty fucking alleyway, starts talking to these guys that buy and sell sex slaves. Next thing I know... he leaves me there with them. You know, my dad meant the fucking world to me. I fucking loved him. But that day changed everything. He sold me off to those pinche cabrónes for sex. My own fucking dad. Just so he could feed my mother's drug habit. He really loved her. They had a really good bond. But he did that to me. It's all right. A few months later, I fucking escaped. Jumped off a balcony. Broke my leg, but I kept running. But that day, I made a vow. And that vow was that one day, when I was old enough... I was going to find him and I was going to put the barrel of a gun in his mouth, and I would make him fucking suck it the way he made me suck dicks. And then five years later, almost to the day. I find this motherfucker. He's in some shitty motel with my mom. I get in there. They're all snuggled up together. I put the fucking barrel right to his mouth... and boom! I fucking blew his brains out, right in front of my fucking mother. You should have seen the fucking look on her face when she realized she was actually wearing my father's fucking brains and his blood all over her fucking body. It was fucking classic. I'll never forget it. That's life. Got a friend for you we're going to see. You forgot one of the most important rules of the game, amigo. Not only do we kill the rat, we got to make the family disappear too. This is the only family I could find of this Sebastian Montoya. Parents died about ten years ago. No aunt, no uncles. Fucking sad, really. But that girl that you were fucking. Uh, Monique? She's one of my girls, actually. I went to her, and she told me all about this pretty little dyke. She's fucking pretty, isn't she? Your brother was a piece of shit traitor. And you're the last rat that's left. And now, we're going to completely eliminate you from the face of this earth. That's fucking exciting, isn't it? It's almost like it was meant to be. You were looking for her, right? Yeah. Hell, yeah. We're looking for this crazy bitch. That's what we do, hermano. Look out for each other. So, how do you want to do this? Want to slice her up? You know what you can do? You can fucking burn her, like you did to her brother. Or you know what I like to do? This thing called the four-way split. That's when you tie her arms and legs to a horse, make them run in all directions, and boom, she explodes. Then I take them down to my primo's hog farm couple of miles away. They're down to the bone in an hour and a half. It's fucking amazing. You know what Juan likes to do? He likes to fucking put them in acid. Can you believe that shit? It's fucking gross. There's boils and shit that go everywhere. Something's fucking wrong with that guy. Anyway, what do you want to do? Kneecap? Oh. The old-fashioned way. Okay. I like that. Come on. I'll have these fuckers bury her. Let's get dinner. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah. Just go to sleep. Go to sleep. Can you stand electrocution? Puto! Jefe, want to kick his ass too? Huh? Throw this shit out. The whole entire thing. And every game. Take it out back and burn it. We have to stop being such little fucking soft pussies that play video games all day long. This shit is done. Do it, cabrón. Do it! Hey... what'd the Feliz brothers say? Roberto still doesn't know about Officer Perez. Juan set the whole thing up. Juan's been pulling the strings and keeping Roberto in the dark. And there's something else. ¿Que? Liza? Yeah. I had to. I had to tell someone. You take this shit with you to the grave, you understand me? Sí. The Feliz party is in two days. I want you to gather the men and go with Portuguese. You train harder than you've ever had to train before, because shit's about to go down to a whole new fucking level. You understand what I'm saying to you? Sí, jefe. DEA, this is Monica. It's time to talk the details. My guest of honor! Stay ready. At least in my eyes. I would just like to say... how special all of you who are sitting at this table are to me. Actually, you know, that's not true, I can't fucking stand most of you. But... either way, most of you have had some sort of... enlightened experience with my brother and myself. And for that, we are eternally grateful. And I think I speak for both of us when I say how grateful we are, because we both know that he would never say anything about it, because he's a mute! But now, I would like to introduce to you the newest member of our family. And I think all of you already know that he's not one of us, he's an American, so please don't hold that against him, even though I fucking do all the time. But I have to say, despite the many bumps on the road, he has proven himself to be very true and loyal. And I want you to know that I look forward to sharing many more memories with you. So, without any further ado, please right now, let's all raise our glasses and cheer to the fact that none of us are fucking politicians, and we are all in the fucking life. Cheers. How's the food? It was good. What is it, pork? I have two secrets I have to tell you. I've been dying on the inside. Okay, what? Number one... I'm on mushrooms. And number two... The food you're eating... ...is human flesh. Aye, cabrón. Yeah, Tulum is great this time of year. Excuse me. Okay. Let's take a walk. I'm hoping to smooth over our past. Won't take a minute. So, what do you want to tell me, huh? I think it's very important... for us to get along. And hopefully, one day... become like brothers. But we both know that will never happen... because I know you set me up to fail. Officer Perez told me, right before I blew his fucking brains out. Raid! Weapons down! Weapons down! Weapons down! Get Roberto! Find him! Follow me, guys. Come. Come on, it's over here. Oh, shit. Cocaina. Ooh-whee! Look at that. Fucking jackpot. Hey, jefe, we did it. We took over the Feliz warehouses. Fuck, yeah, cabrón! We did it. Tell me you sliced the motherfucker! - I fucking love you! - Good shit, man. That's right, motherfuckers! Hell, yeah! What? How the fuck did they let him go? I fucking handed him to them on a silver fucking platter. How can they fuck this up? Looks like somebody just started a war. They could retaliate as soon as tomorrow. We should all be getting ready to leave now. No, there's no way. Even if Roberto escaped, it would take him weeks to rebuild his army and plan an attack. Yeah, but we didn't hit his army. We cut the head off the snake. Half of it, anyway. Be smart. What would you do? I would attack as soon as possible. From every angle. Exactly. Jefe. I know it's bad timing, but is it okay if I go? I haven't seen her in three days. I'm going to go talk to one of her friends. Okay, okay. Get back here as soon as possible, huh? We're leaving in the morning. Sí. And you, round up the guys and meet everybody at the safe house. Sí, jefe. If Roberto Feliz wants a war... he'll have one. Miguel. What the fuck, you piece of shit? - Your team fucked this up bad. - Don't put this on us. You weren't supposed to kill Juan. I should just arrest your cocky ass right now. Go ahead. Damn you people, I swear, you wage wars against each other and act all surprised when shit doesn't go your way. You truly are like little petulant fucking children. Yeah, I'm the one that's fucked here. You're going to go back to your comfy little lifestyle and your air-conditioned little office, and I'm the one that's still on the run. And who's choice was it to be a drug dealer? Huh? You could turn yourself in. - We'll protect you. - No. Help me to bring the whole goddamn show down to its knees. That wasn't the deal. It was my immunity for the Feliz brothers. Exactly. No deal. Nothing until Roberto Feliz is dead or behind bars. Up until now... we've always been on the defensive. This time... this time we go on the attack. Portuguese here will train all of you. I'm going to teach you guys how to kill people. Roberto Feliz must be found and assassinated. When you kill somebody, you never come from the front. - So, train harder. - Come right here. Train harder than you've ever had to train in your lives... I want you to twist the neck. ...because your lives literally depend on it. Stab him right here in the center. Over here, he going to swallow his own blood. Jefe, got a minute? Hey, what's up? It's my sister. I think something bad has happened to her. Yeah. Let's take a walk. Listen, um... she's gone. What do you mean she's gone? I mean she's gone. What else can you tell me? Roberto, that day he picked me up... I don't get it, jefe. Why would they want to hurt her? Because they thought you were the traitor. That's why you wanted me to change my name. So they wouldn't hurt me? But if I'm the traitor... they got to take out my whole familia. Why did they think I was a traitor? Because I... You gave them my name? I... I had to. It was the first name that came to my mind. I had to give them a real name. He would have found out. I'm sorry, mijo. I had no choice. Hey, hermano, come back. Come back, hermano. You didn't tell him, did you? He'll join our enemies. No. No. Don't. Jefe. Chilly Willy, what's up? I haven't heard anything from the guards at location 248. I'm going to go check it out. I'll let you know what I see. Okay. Where the fuck are the guards? - Come on. - Everyone be alert. Fucking coke better be in there. All right, Portuguese, get my back. What the...? Did you hear from the others in the warehouses? No. Dios mio. What's happened? The men. They're all dead. Have you made any plans about the child? What do you mean? Plans for the child? Mija, you got to face reality. This isn't going to work. How dare you say that? You don't know what will happen. You're not a fortune-teller. Open your eyes, mija. You don't have to be a fortune-teller to see this isn't going to end up well. You always do this. You always think you know everything. This isn't about me. This is about that baby inside you. And if you want that baby to have any kind of life, you're going to have to make a decision. I don't want to hear it. And especially not from you. But you listen. Don't fucking talk to me! Mi amor, now is not the time to be soft. Now is the time to go fucking ballistic. Please let me help you. Mi amor, sit down. You weigh less than a 100 pounds, and you've shot a gun less than a handful of times. Now is the time to be real, not to act passionately. Okay? You and my fucking father are the same! I don't need your fucking attitude right now, okay? I need you to help me in a different way. Fine. And how? Tell me how I can help you. You can help me by sitting down on the couch... and watching TV... and having my baby so that it comes out healthy. I am nothing to you but a fucking baby factory. Don't ever fucking do that again to me. Well, I won't, because we'll all be dead. La munequita. Fine. What the fuck are you looking at? She's pregnant with your baby, and you threaten to put your hands on her? Look, I don't need your fucking bullshit right now, okay? I need help. You can either help me, or you can make the situation worse. What's it going to be? Hey, ése, don't put this on me. This is the result of your fucked-up choices. Don't get down on the people that are trying to support you. How the fuck are you supporting me? You're living in my fucking house, sleeping in a bed that I paid for, eating my fucking food. How exactly are you supporting me? How about you call some of your old cartel contacts and recruit more solders. Hey, I told you how this ends up! All my camaradas are either dead or in prison. Then what fucking use are you to me? It's Roberto. He's got at least 20 men. I think they're Alvaro's guys. Give me a gun. Let's go through the back. Grab Gloria. How the fuck did Alvaro and Roberto's men find us? Sebastian knows where all out safe house are. You know what? It's going to be okay. I just... I have to find out another way to fuck Roberto up. If I can get to him first... then we stand a chance. - Hey. We need to talk. - Yeah? What is it? I need a favor. Yeah, I'm listening. Look, let me take my daughter to my aunt's in Guadalajara. Let her have the baby. When she's healthy, we'll call you, come join us. But I don't want her with all this stress. Do you actually think that I would let you take my unborn son away from me? Are you fucking delusional, old man? Hey, this isn't about you. This is about her and your kid. They're not going anywhere. I'm not going to let them leave my side. - Understand? - Listen, wait. They're not fucking going anywhere. I don't want to fucking talk about this anymore. Gloria! Dominic! Dominic! Yo. Yo. Get up. She's gone. They left us. They fucking left us. Fuck them. Fuck them both. What's the plan, boss? We only got one option. To turn Roberto Feliz in to the DEA. Well... that's not our only option. - No? - Hmm... We could just go out, guns blazing. Tony Montana style? Fuck, yeah. You got some pair of balls on you, mijo. I got an idea. This is Monica. I'm calling you from a burner phone. Erik, what do you want now? I'm going to hand over to you Roberto Feliz. It's about time. I'll tell you where I'll be today. Where the fuck have you been? Our deal still holds, right? Yeah, our deal still holds. Who's this? You know who this is, you fucking piece of shit. My little American bitch. I want to cut a deal. It's my life for my wife, her father and Dominic's. Hmm, interesting. Come on, Roberto, you've got no need for them anyway. This is true. I'll send you a text message later, letting you know where I am and where you can come pick me up. Looking forward to killing you. You may just get your wish, Tony. Odelay. Put down your guns. You're not gonna shoot anyone. Mamba two in position. Roger that. I have to be honest. I expected more from you. Thought you were going to pull some shit. But this? I'm disappointed. Is this all you got? Yeah, well... life's got a way of fucking shit up, I guess. Holy shit, pendejo. My dick is so hard right now. I'm thinking of all the ways I'm going to make your fucking death excruciatingly slow and excruciatingly painful. It's going to be so fucking good. Yeah, I'm sure it will. Standing by. Roger that. Mamba unit. On my lead. Okay. Mamba four, wait for my signal. We want Roberto Feliz alive. Well, you said you'd let him go. I said a lot of things, didn't I? All teams, Mamba one moving in. Freeze! Tell your men to drop their weapons! What took you guys so long? You didn't think I was going to fall for that twice, did you? Mamba two, two vehicles inbound to your position. Took these guys long enough too. There we go. Now it's a party. I'm going to give you five seconds to drop your weapons. I fucking love it when a woman threatens me. It turns me fucking on. I like that. Kill them all! All teams, secure the perimeter. You're the baddest motherfucker I know, hermano. Got you. I got you Roberto Feliz. Dead or alive, right? Yeah, you did. I want to go back to Texas. Yeah, I'm afraid that's not going to happen. What the fuck do you mean it's not going to happen? There was never any immunity deal, stud. You lose. Arrest him. Sorry, amigo, the Mexican authorities paid a hefty sum for your capture. Motherfucking lying puta... Adiós. You fucking lying motherfucker. Puta. You're going to get one hour outside every ten days. You're going to get a phone call every two weeks, and a shower every week. And you best start remembering all those cartel names, cabrón, because you're going to tell me everything you know about everyone. And mark my words, everyone breaks. You're going to be begging me to kill you by the end of all this. You got a name for me, pendejo? I got two. I'm listening. Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. They were notorious in the cocaine world. Pendejo. Name! I want a lawyer. You're not in America, boy. No. No. Oh, no, no, no, no. No. No... Give me a name. Miguel Antonio. Miguel Antonio. He's on the Feliz cartel payroll. Give him his shower and his phone call. Welcome to your new home. This is Angelina. It's Erik. You got to get the Department of Justice to get me out of here. I'm an American, goddamn it. No one cares if you are an American. And you have to come to terms for what you did and how you are expected to be treated, got it? I have already contacted the Justice Department. They told me yesterday that they will expedite you to the United States within 30 days. - Can you hold them to that? - Seriously? They are the Justice Department. They can't be held to shit. Look, I don't think I'm going to make it here that long. The warden's playing some sick-ass fucking games in here. I don't know what to tell you, and I don't know what else I can do. All I know, I do my job calling them every day. And you wait for my good news, you got it? Okay. Tell me you got some good news for me. Something. You're not going to believe this shit. I gave them the whole thing. American, poor, lost citizen thing, and it worked. You are going to be expedited tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. Can you make it until that? I don't have much of a choice. Well, you don't. Just one more night. Maybe get some laundry duties. Do something. Be around people, then the warden can't get to you. I don't think that's possible. Can you make it? Just get me out of here by 8:00 a.m. See you tomorrow. I hear you'll be leaving us in the morning. So I got a little surprise for you before you go. Oh, yeah? What's that? A solicitor, with very deep pockets behind him. Who the fuck are you? I accept my last judgment. I won't retaliate against you, hermano. When it happens, you'll see it coming.
