To the regimental colours... salute! Present arm! THE FALCON FIGHTERS - Lieutenant Kihara! - Yessir! Being a flag bearer is the highest honorary post for an officer. Yet you're refusing it! Can you tell me the reason? Because I want to be a pilot! Will I be transferred to the Air Force? I see... You want to be a pilot. From here on, it'll be the air age. Oh no! You're wrong! The Air Force's just started! How d'you know they're better than the infantry? But, sir! By joining the Air Force from the start, I'll have a better chance to advancement! - So, you're very eager about it... - Please trasnfer me to the Air Force! Listen, Kihara. I know the dream of young officers is to be a pilot. - But, listen, lieutenant Kihara. - Yessir! Why don't you think it over once more? Since you've started in the infantry... ...you should end in the infantry! As an infantry officer, you should be more proud of yourself! - D'you understand me? - Thank you for the advice! But I must... join the Air Force, sir! - Lt. Kate! - Yessir'.! - The brick demon you hit on top of the roof means a lot to the general! - Yessir! Why did you do such a thing? Sorry! I was jealous because... ...it was looking at the sky, sir! Enough: You can't be forgiven for that reason! We might have to take action for such a stupid thing! Wait! Let me tell you a story. - Who was it? - It was me. There was the same brick demon. On the top of the temple at that time. And I bet with the priest for a bottle of sake... ...that I could knock it off, and I did and won. So... can you tell us why you put the brick demon on the roof? In order not to forget the fighting spirit... ...of that time. - Lieutenant Kato. - Yessir! I'm proud of your flight training today. Thank you, sir! Shimora... Order the same thing and put it back up there as soon as possible. Yessir! I\\ \ \N\' \ \ it Q - You'd better watch out next time. - Yessir! General, is anything wrong with this men? They're complaining of their collar insignia color. They want to have it a blue color. That's why they're here. I see, sir... Hey... So, you were with the 25th Infantry... Yessir! I know... You were the flag bearer for the same regiment before me. Three years ago. - You're one of them too. - Yessir! And I came here the way you did! What an idiot! If I'm an idiot, you should be an idiot, too! What?! Well, he got you! General... may I request that... these men get the blue insignia! - All right. - Thank you, sir! Remember! Being a pilot is not an easy job! You must do your very best! Thank you very much, sir! Excuse me, sir! Wait! There's... one more person I'd like you to meet. Is it... another pilot volunteer? You'll find out later. Please come to my house tonight. What's wrong with you?! Gen'ral! Can you tell me what's all this about?! - It's about marriage. - Marriage?! Go in and ask her! Fight! The way you did with the demon on the roof! Thanks for your kindness... ...but I think... ...she'll turn me down. - I... I know that's what she'll say! - Idiot! How d'you know without asking her, you, coward?! - Go on! - Yessir. - Go, I said! - Yessir! But it's useless! Well?! Go! Can I come in? It was during training... That a young flyer crashed his plane in front of my eyes and died instantly. And it might also happen to me, someday. To me... ...it is like asking to die, by joining the Air Force... To me, I'm likely to have more respect for a man who is not afraid to die. And I might die at any time... ...as long as I'm an Air Force pilot! But, I will be praying for you to have good luck. - How can I get away? - What?! Nothing... But, anyway, to be a pilot is like volunteering to die! For that reason, I believe you've been living very carefully. - But... - To me... I like to lead that kind of life. You'd better think it over... Young man, how did you make out, then? Well... It's just like in a dog fight... No matter how you shoot her, she just keeps hanging on. I don't blame her. A young man like you, with such a job, who might die any time, cannot be turned down by women. I just wonder why... A pilot might disappear over the clouds... Kazuko... I believe you like a man who will die in the sky... ...that's the reason you've chosen this young man. Yes. Oh, no... I've made the wrong move! You don't you give UP?! - Yessir! - Good! You've lost! - You fly to gently. - Yessir! Fight planes are made to attack. Of course, you must defend, but don't forget to attack! - Yessir! - All right. I'll tell you what: show me how good you're! And, in case of trouble during the flight, I'll take responsibility. Look, sir, I've got it! I've got it! I've said I've got it! Idiot! Hey, Kihara, did you do anything wrong?! I broke the rule! lm knocked the brich demon off the roof! Oh, I see... It proves he's a good pilot, then... Lt. Kato! You should know, you're with him during the flight! I was sleeping, until we landed. - What?! - I were. It was my responsibility! - No! It was mine! - You shut up! Do you remember... what you're told the last time? That you shouldn't do it again, whatsoever? Yessir! - I remember it! - Then... why did you do it?! - Lieutenant Kato. - Yessir! You're not worried about it... - He looks as if he's done nothing! - I don't blame him. - What?! I know how lieutenant Kato feels about it. He can break his word to me, if, by doing that, it'll be better training... - for the future of our Air Force... - Yessir! That's exactly what I thought! - That's the reason he's not worried... - General! Should we let them do such a thing all the time? Getting the brick demon shows they are careless pilots. - Lieutenant Kihara. - Yessir! From here on, in order to train good pilots, right here, I don't mind if every pilot knocks off the brick demon! - If you wanna do it that way, fine. - Yessir! Thank you very much! However... ...only one, or you pay... - Good evening! - Come in! Hey! I've been waiting! Come! Sit down. Wow! You sure are celebrating... Let's have a nice time. Well... How d'you like the girls? - Let me pour for you. - Just a minute! Wait for one more guest. Can you tell me who's the other guest? - He's my right hand man. - What?! - What about me?! - Don't get excited. Who could it be... Is it lieutenant Kondo? - No. - Is it Sakarai, then? No, it's not him. Who could it be, then?! He's here now. Sorry to have kept you waiting. You're looking good... Come on, let's start! Please. We've been waiting. Come on. Thank you. - Is he a Chinese officer? - That's right. - He's a pilot officer, studying here, in Japan. - Does he know the song, too? - What song? - You know... about the handsome officer.. - He made all the women cry for him... - Oh yeah'.! Especially Cho... He had so many girls... ...that he ran away. Maybe that's the reason why he came to this country! No! No, no, no! That's not true! All right... Let's have a good time! Come on, have a drink! Thank you. - Have a drink. - Lieutenant Cho... Why aren't you wearing civilian clothes? Because... I'm very proud of my uniform... and my country. - Why... What a man! - See what I mean? He's strictly a career soldier. And no woman could ever get near him. Really?! You said he had many women before, right? O, I forgot! Cheers! - Thank you. - Cheers. - Relax, Cho. - Yes. Where's Cho? Wait! She's busy now! Hey! What's the matter?! I'm waiting for you! Wait! You shouldn't come busting in here! And you must show respect before entering someone's room! I see... Chinese bastard! Don't you Japanese people feel ashamed to be drinking with this Chinese bastard? Shut up! What did you say?! Watch your mouth! Apologize! Are you Chinese, too? No, I am not. You should feel ashamed with yourself, siding with that bastard! Outside! I'll teach you a lesson! Wait! Lieutenant Cho! Allow me to apologize for the rudeness of my countryman. - Kihara! You wait here, too! - No! I must go! That's an order! I'm really ashamed... to have such a bad man as countryman! Apologize to him! If you don't feel like it... ...I'll teach you a good lesson! You bastard! - Get him! - I got him! Stop it'.! - Let's get out of here! - MP5! Wait! Stop! Hold it! Who're you? I'm flying instructor, lieutenant Kato. I see! Thanks. Wait a minute! I'm sorry, you'll have to come to headquarters with us. - Excuse me. You've got a visitor. - I don't feel like seeing anybody. - It's a Chinese officer... - What?! Lieutenant Cho?! Sorry... To bother you... Hey! I'm glad to see you! - Please, sit down. - Thank you. O... This is... from the General... Thank you. Well, well... - I'm to report for duty again. - Oh, that makes me very happy! - The general says to thank you... - Why?! I understand... that you helped me... ...to get... out of this trouble. Thank you very much. No! It was because of me! - Otherwise there's no... - Let's forget all about it. And let's start our training tomorrow! Thank you very much. But I must go back to my country. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Is it because... of the trouble? - No. It's an order from my government. I see... That's too bad... I wish I could stay longer, to learn more from you... Why not tell them, as an excuse, that you need more training, and you should be allowed to stay longer? For at least six months, or more... That you have a chance, you know, to better yourself... But... I'm a soldier in the military service... ...of my country... ...and I must obey orders. That's all right. I guess we can't help it... Kazuko... Let's have a farewell party. - All right. - I think, you like Sukiyaki. Yes, I do. Cho! This is to our good luck! Thanks. I hope the taste's all right for you. Don't worry! He likes Japanese food. He eats like his own country food. Yes?! I can't believe a foreigner could get used to it so soon. - Me, too. - Did you do a lot of cooking? Yes, I did. Well, here, have some more. Yes, please. - Will you have some more, too? - Yeah. - Listen, sir... - Yes? As individuals... ...the Chinese... and the Japanese... ...are good friends and understand each other very well. But... ...the country, and each person... that's different, I believe. I learnt and knew it when I came here, to this country. Thanks. I'm glad you told me the truth. Cho. Our aim is to train our men to fight for our country. As long as we're in the military, that's our duty! Yes, but... I wish our friendship could continue for ever. And I hope you do, too. Thank you... ...for everything. And I'll never forget it. Take care of yourself. Thank you. 0... Yeah... Here're some pics I took of you... They're not too good, but take them, please. Thanks. Thay'll be pleasant memories. Thanks again. - All right! Come on! Bring it up! - All right. I want a song! All right! Please, sir, let me start it! D'you remember the song you taught me? D'you remember? O, I got it! O, that's a good one! All right, let's hear it, then! On the 7th of July, Showa 16, the China conflict started, and Japan was winning... ...all over the front... ...and occupied most of the enemy's territory. The Air Force was also ordered to join the battle, ...on the China mainland. Hey, Tinbo, I hope you understand that I didn't come back the first because I ran away. I fought too! And don't worry, your master, Kihara, will be back soon. Hey! Are you listening to me? Look! He's back now. Can you see? Kihara's plane is landing! Tinbo, your master's back. Tinbo! Hey!... Tinbo! Come back! You are that happy? All right, all right... That's a good dog... Look! The captain's back! Captain! Are you all right? - Hey, how come you're back so early? - Sorry, but I got lost. - Come back with the squadron next time. - Very well, sir. Captain, I'll mark it for you. You look happy. Well... you make me happy. Because you shot down so many enemy planes. I see... so mark down two. - No, it was three! - No, I'm not so sure about the third one. I know the third went down, too. I went after that plane. To make sure it went down. Did you do something? Yes... I shot about 3-4 bullets. - So it's all yours! - Yessir. Congratulations! Thank you, sir! Lieutenant! You're really lucky, aren't you? Shut up! Just watch and see! I'll show you one of these days! Here comes Yamamoto! We sure lost many men... We did. Strange to shoot down so many enemy planes... ...but it hurts me more to lose one of my men. I know, sir. And I feel the same way, too. But, I guess, it can't be helped... Because of that, you haven't been sleeping lately. I'm worried about your health. Maybe you're right... Now, the fighting morale of our men is much better. So... Let's fight hard! And not worry about the dead! Of course, I understand how you feel, but, please, fight like a demon, sir! To be a leader, I guess, you're right... Too bad... I was born that way... That's why... you're strong in the air! Thanks. And your high fighting morale has helped me a lot up to now. Thank you. - Sorry for being a nuisance. - Forget it. It's always good to hear that song... Must be Ando... It sure sounds good, doesn't it? Thank you, sir. I'm happy because I shot down my first enemy plane today. Tell you what. Why not come with me tomorrow? Well, it's up to the captain... But I don't think he'll let me go... Don't you trust me? No, not exactly... I see... - Looking to be lucky again? - What?! - Remember: you can't always be lucky... - Sorry. I thought you didn't know about it... Our commanding officer... Report to headquarters tomorrow. To receive... a letter of commendation. For our squadron. Tinbo... Isn't that great?! "Citation" "This is to honor Air Force major Kato and his men," "For their outstanding raids during their service on the China warfront. " "Up to the day, the squadron has destroyed much of the enemy's Air Force." "In addition, they have heavily damaged the enemy supply lines. " "That has helped our ground forces, and disrupted the enemy supplies. " "Also, in aerial combat they have destroyed 56 enemy planes... " ".. and destroyed 9 enemy planes on the ground," "including their ammunition depot." "Because of these outstanding accomplisments... "your squadron is widely respected. " "Signed by General Tokohara" Lieutenant Kato reporting, sir! Thanks for the outstanding job. You really deserved the citation. Thank you. General... May I ask you a favor? Due to our men who died heroically on the battle front... ...the squadron was citated because of them. - I understand. - Plpease, General! By the way, I want to tell you some very important information. Yessir! D'you remember the Chinese officer who studied here, in Japan, with you? - Called Cho Eishun as an trainee... - Yessir. He was a good student and a man of high spirits. He is the leader of the fighter planes of the Chinese Air Force right now. He's assigned to the Chinese base in this area. His insignia is a tiger. He's on our tail! Lieutenant Kihara! Get him! He went down! Ando's plane is landing! He's wounded! Get the medics! Hurry! Are you all right, sir? Get out of the way! What happened? Lieutenant Ando reporting back... About 30 miles from here... to the North... we were attacked by enemy planes. - And lieutenant Kihara... - What happened to Kihara? Kihara... died... he was in a dog fight... I X' \ \ 9 \ 'A ! - What plane? - It's... the new model fighter... - with a tiger insignia on it's fuselage. - What?! Tiger insignia?! Yessir. I went after it and we were in a dog fight. But he... he got away. I X' \ \ 9 \ 'A ! But I tried my best! Tinbo!... Please, forgive me! Lieutenant Ando reporting, sir! All right. Come in. How's your wound? Don't worry, sir. It'll be all right soon. I see... Take care of yourself! Sir! Please take revenge! Tinbo's crying... I feel sorry... For Tinbo! I can't stand hearing Tinbo! Please, sir! - I'm with you. - Thank you, sir! Fight like a demon... Those are the last words he said to me. All right! Let's go! Well! I can't believe it! Hello! I've just came back from China yesterday. - Are you alone? - No, the major's back, too. I see... Mrs Kato... The way I understood, he's not coming back here. On the 23rd of October, 1937, corporal Saito... ...died heroically in an aerial combat on the China front. I ordered the attack, that day... On the 8th of March, 1938, sergeant Ohama fought fiercely... ...in the aerial combat on the China front. He shot down several enemy planes. He died heroically! I ordered the attack, that day. Lieutenant Kihara... ...after you died... ...it hurt Tinbo so much, that he died, too... He refused to eat anything... and became so weak tht he died. Wish I could've done something for him... Sorry... that this happened. Thank you very much for coming here, today. I'm sure my son would be very happy about what you've done. I'm a retired soldier... ...and my son volunteered for the armed forces. And we knew that.. someday... this would happen. I really feel sorry... ...to see such a good man like him die. Major Kato... My son has done his duty for his country, and he's through fighting... ...but you... must still fight, which is your duty. So, please, forget about my son. And, please, take care! As his parents... I know how you feel. And I really feel sorry about it! - 0, son, come over here! - Hey! - Your grandson? - I'd wish so! Mother! Kazuko! D'you understand now? He's your son. It's been two years, I guess you can't be blamed. Son, come back here, all right? Let's say "Welcome back" to your father. Welcome home. There's another place where you should be! You shouldn't have come to this house... ...at this time of grief! Don't you understand?! As the wife of a military man! - Major Kato! - Yessir! As a senior officer from the same military academy... ...I must advise you as your superior. D'you think it'll be of any help to your men who died in battle... ...to mistreat and destroy the happy life of your family? You fool! Father, be careful of what you say! And I believe a man like you should know better than that. Understand? D'you know who told your wife to come here? One of your own men, lieutenant Ando. What?!... Ando?! Yes... He told me to come and he would watch our house. - Ando, thank you. - O, welcome back! I was playing the flute... - Thank you very much for watching our house. - Not at all. I was prepared to meet thieves, but not bill collectors... But nothing happened, everything was all right. - Well, how about some tea? - Yes. Come on. Ando. Thank you very much. - I sure appreciate it. - Forget it! Well, I must leave now... - Where're you going? - To my hometown. - How far is your house? - It's a long way off, so I don't have much time. Sorry... - Is it because of me? - Forget it! I am still a single man, anyway... Good bye. - Ando... - What? - D'you have somebody in mind? - What d'you mean? Some girl you like... I'm afraid not. I'm not a goodlooking man... And... it's not as easy to find a girl, as it is to play the flute. I see... I want him to get married. - Give him time to think. - How about me? Did I have time to think? Well, I know but... He might die anytime, so he shouldn't get married! That's what everybody says. Don't you feel sorry for him? I don't know why... ...but they always seem to remember... ...when they shot down... ...the plane of major Cho... I had to kill him because of this war! - I wish I'd shut my mouth. - No, no, please go on. If you feel better by saying it, I'd be happy to listen to you. These "Falcon" fighters are newly produced war planes for the army Air Force. There're high hopes for it's fighting efiency. But there seems to be a design defect. Have you discovered in what part? Well, during the test flights, it came apart several times... I believe it is difficult to be built for long-range flights, together with its fighting potential, at the same time. Therefore, the "0197" fighter plane will be improved for action. Wait a minute! I flew the "Falcon" fighter in test flights many times. And I agree that there is a flaw in its design. However, if we keep on finding what its weak points are, I'm sure we can expect a good aircraft. I'm confident! We've been listening to you for two years, and I think we've been wasting our time. No. I don't think so. D'you think that the old "97" planes can fight modern enemy weapons? We're not only fighting China, we must be ready to defend ourselves from other countries. Look at the Navy: they already have the famous "0" fighters! But the Army is still fooling around with the old models! But we can only go so far! If we keep on fighting with the "97" models, it's just like killing our excellent flyers. I know that checking its flaws is a difficult asigment, but let me take the job, until it's found safe! Please wait for the results. It shouldn't take too long. - But my decision remains the same. - Wait a minute'.! You'd better think it over! If that's your decision, you'd better forget about the paratroopers too. Otari! Don't be a fool! The paratroopers are the main striking force for a surprise attack! I agree with you. That's why they're training so hard, day and night. Tough training, undoubtely, will bring good results in a surprise attack. But, this is under the condition they'll land safely. If the paratroopers don't survive the attack of the enemy planes, while they're descending, you won't have many paratroopers alive, when they finally hit the ground. I believe you know... ...that the newly produced... war planes of other countries no longer fly with their wheels down. And d'you think we can fight with our old model planes?! And can you positevely guarantee the safe landing of our paratroopers? "Strong, but slow. " That's how they called our paratroopers. In order to put the full fighting force of the paratroopers on the battle front... ...it is necesaru to have the "Falcon" fighters as our new war planes! I'm through! General! What's your decision? Keep on going and checking the "Falcon" fighter's defects. The meeting is closed for today. - Mihake! Thank you! - Good luck! Don't worry! I'm sure I can put the "Falcon" fighters into action. 64th Air Force is to be the first unit fully equipped with "Falcon" fighters. The "Falcon" fighter was almost scraped. Luckily, the Air Force succedeed in correcting its defects... ...and put it into action. With the newly produced "Falcon" fighters... we shall train harder and improve our aviation abilities. But, unfortunately, we just don't have enough time... ...because of the national crisis. Today, we've received an order to be transferred on the war front in China. Before the transfer, everyone will be given a three days leave. And all of you take care of coming back on time and in good condition. That's all! Present... ...arm! Commander, I hope you're going home this time. That's none of your business. How about you? Well... I've heard you're getting on allright with Keiko... True, I have a date with her on the first day of my leave, Is that so?!... - I'm glad to hear that. - I hope you'll have a nice leave too. Don't worry. - Are you going to marry her? - I'll ask her. - D'you mean it? - Yes I see... I don't want to put you down for introducing me to such a nice girl. I don't know if she wants to marry me, but I can ask her. I'm sorry, I thought we were supposed to meet on this side... No. There's no mistake. - What?! - I came on this side on purpose. Why?! I'll be leaving for the battle front very soon. It's been nice... knowing you. Take care of yourself! So long, Keiko. Wait, please! Watch out! Are you all right? Keiko... I think that had we been born in peaceful times... ...I'd have asked you to marry me for sure. I hope you understand that because I love so much... ...I can't let you marry a man whose life can end any time. But I'm very proud to be a soldier. To fight for the sake of my country... I really feel ashamed of myself... - to have the same feeling. - Listen... Keiko... I may not see you again... ...but you'll always be in my heart. Forgive me. I'll be waiting. Take care of yourself. Good bye. What are you looking for? 0... Something to make a muffler... I have it already. I was planning to give it to you when you left. I see... 0, this is your wedding kimono... What's this? Why did you put it here? Just in case something happens to me? Is that why? Why do such a stupid thing? Remember... ...two years ago, when you came back from China... ...he said that as long as you're in military service... ...you prepare yourself to die... As a soldier... ...I'm just like a dead man. But I must die if something should happen to you. I see... But, listen... Let me tell you something. I'm a professional soldier... ...and in life or death... ...as a soldier, I must do my duty. But... you, as a wife... ...you have the duty to take care of our family. I know... A soldier's wife must die with her husband But you must forget this. I'm in the service without worries because of you, Kazuko! All right? Take care of the family! I will. On the 8th of December, 1942, Japan declared war against the Allied Forces. Japan's naval forces attacked Pearl Harbor and the Anlly attacked Singapore, winning all over the front. The "Falcon" fighters made their first appearancein the skies over Malaysia. In this attack, the "Falcon" fighters were challenged... ...by the British "Buffalo" fighters. But the "Falcon" fighters were winning in aerial combat. Speak up! Doesn't anyone know what happened to the commander? Speak up! - Tohai! You were with the commander! - Yessir! - Then, you should know! - I'm sorry, sir! - A message from the commander! - 0! What does it say? "I am above Kinian with Mizuno" - It's about 80 km. - Yeah, they'll make it. - Come on! Keep it going! We're getting closer! Come on! Here they come! He's been hit! - Call a medic! - Yessir! Mizuno! Take care landing! - Look out! - Look out! - Sawai! - Sawai! Are you al right? Sawai! Sawai! What happened? What're you trying to do?! - Please, commander! - No, you don't! - Let me die! - Stop it! - Please, let me go! - Stop it, I said! Stop it, idiot! D'you have to die here? There also is a fight here! But I wanna die! Because of me, sir! I can't be forgiven for it! Stand up! I said stand up! Can't you hear me?! Mizuno... Be the replacement of Sawai, and fly with me from here on. But, go to the hospital first and get medical treatment. Thank you, sir! Understand? And forget about the whole thing. When you get well let's fly together! - I'll be waiting! - Thank you, sir! Is Kato around? - Yessir. - Can't you hear me?! Excuse me. Can you tell me who is Kato? The big boss. Your boss. - And can you tell me who you are? - Don't get smart! Don't you know me?! I'm sorry, but I don't. - Hey! Miyaki! - Kato! Let me introduce you: this is major Miyaki from the paratroopers I'm sorry, sir! I'm lieutenant Aoi! Don't worry about it. That's all right. Kato, any drinks? How about some Johnny Walker? You're still the same! Let's go! You're all right! Keep it up! Yessir! 0 boy! What a man! If it wasn't for his help, the "Falcon" fighters would've been scrapped. What d'you mean? The higher authorities wanted to scrap the "Falcon" fighters, but he opposed it. - I see... - So, the "Falcon" fighters owe him a lot. That's for sure! - Anything else? - No. Thanks. Well... That's it... The paratroops go into action, then... After the occupation of Singapore. - I hope they're right. - Why? The enemy will retreat from Malaysia to Sumatra for sure. I can prove it. Because the enemy is enlarging the Palembang airfield. We've got to move, then... You've got to move the other way. You've got to move while the enemy is still in Singapore! - But.. this is the HQ decision. - To hell with our HQ! Don't be foolish! Don't you know general Yamashita, once called "the tiger of Malaysia"? You'd better watch out! All right! Let's find out! - Are you sure? - Leave it up to me! The time has come for me to help you. If he's the tiger of Malaysia, I'm the falcon of Malaysia! General! We must change our strategy, and attack Palembang airfield first! Please, send the paratroopers there as soon as possible! Kato, that's enough! The general made up his mind. The HQ decisions and his orders must be followed. What?! If we don't change our strategy our paratroopers will suffer great loses! That's none of your business! Just obey orders and carry out your duty in good faith. Listen! You're just a wing commander, you don't know anything about war strategy! Wait! Major Kate is a wing commander and has flown over enemy teritory many times. So he knows what is going on. Yessir! - Major Kato. - Yessir! I'm changing our strategy to attack Palembang airfield first. You said you could save the lives of many paratroopers. Yessir! Because of their weak defences, and I can also give full air support. What do you mean? The others will be attacking. General! I can offer all my fighter planes to cover the paratroopers. Without heavy enemy air attack, and light attack from the ground forces. General! Please approve it! All right. I'll approve it. - And wish you good luck. - Thank you, sir! We've orders to protect the paratroopers. We'll land at Palembang airfield. Therefore, we have to destroy the enemy's air force as much as possible. And we've got to act fast! But they are too far from us now. So we've got to move to Kuantan airfield immediately! But the Bharu airfield is still under enemy control! We'll attack and destroy it! Our ground forces should be attacking Gemas! If things go right, we'll be making a tactical landing! Sounds like a rough move! Make up your mind! - Commander'. - Yeah! We'd better pull back temporary! Look! The "Falcon" fighters! Let's go! All right! Come on! Move on! Forward!

And the commander should be happy... that he is back without being killed... I really can't understand the commander! I feel very sorry for lshitomi. - Lieutenant Aoi... - Yessir! I knew the commander very well... When we were in China he was very brave and strong in any dogfight. But he is not fighting, all he does is cry for his dead men. And if his men won in the fight, it really cheered him up. - He was exactly like you. - No! - That's not true! - As a squadron commander, it's all right. But as a wing commander, you have more responsibility. You've got to watch every movement. To command and protect the lives of many men. That's the duty of a commander. And he's trying to let you know; to make you a good commanding officer. D'you understand? Captain Honchu is dead. If I die, you're next in line to take over my place. - Wake up! - Yessir! I understand very well. I am sorry. Now, I feel much better... Captain... how about playing the flute for us? I know everybody wants to hear it. All right. Captain! Stop it'.! Captain Aoi... let's pray for the captain. Can we, please? Please! - Please! - Please! May I come in? Come in. - What d'you want? - Commander! We want to get together and pray for Ando tonight. - Will you approve it? - That's not necesary! But... Tomorrow morning at 2 o'clock, standby to take off! You'll attack Palembang airport. You got it? Yessir! Listen! According to the report from the commander of the 64th Wing, the command of the Palembang airfield has fallen into our hands. Our paratroopers will jump on schedule, for the surprise attack on Palembang. And I wish all of you good luck. Now is the time for us to act. Really hard training has come to its use. And the airfield will be ours! Before the attack, let us pray for our country. For its succes. Attention! Half-right face! Bow your heads! Take a look! The "Falcon" fighters are covering us. - Look! - Be still! What's the matter? You scared? Don't worry, we're covered! They'll do the job! Get up and hook up! To the door! All right, get ready! All right! Let's go! It's an order from HQ! "Order: The 64th Wing will move to Singapore, " "and be on stanby for the next attacks on the Sumatra and Java airfields. " - That's all! - Very well! After several air battles, Kato and his 64th Wing, were ordered to move from base to base, to attack the retreating enemy. This time they were ordered to standby for Akiabu airfield. Well... I wonder what's going on... - Commander, do you have a minute? - Yeah, go ahead. Can you direct us without being in the plane? Please leave the flying up to us, sir! Does it mean I shouldn't fly anymore? - You've just got your promotion and... - Don't be foolish! Promotion only means harder work. Besides, the commander is getting close to being 40... - So, you think I'm getting old... - No, sir! But we're strong now... and we're sure we can do the flying. And we want you to be known as the undefeated flying officer. I think there're no finer pilots over the age of 40 in the air now. I've never heard of any. - Please! - Please, sir! - Commander! - Please, sir! - Please, commnader! - Commander! - Please, sir! - Please! Come on, let's sing the "Falcon" fighters' song!

One... two... three... It's an air raid! Let's go! Commander! I'm back from the hospital! I'm ready to fight again! Please, let me join you tomorrow! Damn it! Go back! No, never! Take it! Go back! - Commander! - Go back! Good! He's here! Commander! Commander! Commander! Commander! It was on the 22nd of May, 1943. Lieutenant-colonel Kato Tateo made his last appearance in the skies.
