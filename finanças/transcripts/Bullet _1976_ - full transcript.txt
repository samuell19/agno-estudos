MrD.P. "Please, sir. Come" There was a call from Delhi. - Who was it? He didn't disclose his name. He asked me to tell you... that Mr X had called. _ All right He's coming to Bombay tonight and wants to see you Book a room for him at Hotel lnternational "Book the room in my name _ Those gentleman are in there, sir" So they are here? Send Zafarullah Wait till we open! We aren't selling pumpkins here Wait till we open up Make sure the accounts are okay. Our department mustn't go wrong Mr D.P. wants you. - The creditors are there...? I thought I was the only one you owed money to It's a small market. You can't hide things forever The two of you together lent him 2.5 million He owes 2.5 million to me alone - 2.5 and 2.5 makes it 5 million "1 million he owes me, which makes it 6 million" "How much does he owe you, Shivcharan? _ Now that it's out in the open..." why must I hide it? He owes me 2 million! 2 million...? That makes it 8 million in all! "What do you intend to do, Mr Durga Prasad?" Why're you quiet? Say something "Call from ltaly, sir" "You borrowed money from me under the pretext of buying ships, D.P"' "It's six months now, and I haven't seen any ship" I want to know how my money is secure? And how is our money secure? There's only one security for your money. My reputation "D.P. Shipping is worth 800 million, not just 8 million" "lf you don't trust me, take your money and get lost" Settle their accounts. _ I've already brought the cheque book I had warned you. It was against your grain... to borrow from such petty people _ Old fossil! Who's petty? "You're taking offense! This is no petty business, sir" We're into shipping. With 2.5 million... all we can buy is a horn for the ship "Am I right, sir?" "Call from Japan, sir" Mehra...? Go on. Have you received my quotation? Place an order for a ship in Japan itself When will I get the first ship? In 3 months? I've deposited 30 million with the Reserve Bank You can withdraw the money there Just don't worry about money. The show must go on "You guys are still here? _ Follow me, please.."' "let's settle your interest. _ One moment, Khan saheb" "D. P., you misunderstand us. _ We didn't come for the money" We came only for a reassurance "Large businesses are carried out on a large scale, Mr Thadani" Things take time. We have to possess the courage "Could you excuse us, please? _ Certainly" We simply misunderstood things Mail this Right now _ Very well "How much money do we have in the bank, Zafarullah?" Nothing. We have overdrawn half a million. The bank manager has served a notice And what if the creditors had agreed to accept cheques? "Barking dogs, sir. They're scared of people who bite" "The authoritative tone you use, well.."' How are the shares selling? _ Selling...? No dearth of suckers. They're making a beeline for our shares "Con as many people as you can, in the quickest time possible" We will disappaer after that "Sir, do take care of this poor man" Lest you disappear... and I find myself in a twirl! You play it _ Go on. Not my cup of tea "You have a nice voice, Dharam. Join my band. You'll be famous" "I'm hiding my real name, Braganza. - From whom?" >From her So what happened at the office? Are you a secret service officer? _ Why? You seem to be more interested in my office than me "Don't be angry, dear. Finish your tea" "You've got to visit a friend again? _ Well, that's true" Exactly at eight. - Give or take five or ten minutes _ Why do you get offended? So go away. Who's stopping you? "You will come, if you're my boyfriend. Or else, I won't talk to you" Is that all...? I'll call my friend and tell him to go to hell "I'm going to enjoy the seventh heaven today... with my darling, Sapna" And open your mouth "Rajesh, will you stand in for me for duty tonight?" "I'm held up somewhere. _ Aren't really held up, are you?" No. I'm laying a trap for Durga Prasad "Watch your step, sir. Lest you fall in the trap" No sweat It's so terribly hot... open the windows. Go on It's really hot. Why don't you guys take off your jackets...? I'm soaked. _ Take off your coat It's so hot You work in D.P"s office? - Yes I want to buy shares of the company. Could you please help me? Go to the third floor and meet Mr Zafarullah Khan Thanks That's a beautiful color Are you following me? _ You have been drawing me Don't you see? You have me all tied up in knots "l told you, we ought to have bought the tickets earlier" "l have an extra ticket, if you wish" "Smart guy. You bought that extra ticket for me, didn't you?" You're smart too. You unravel the secrets of the heart There's a Russian ballet troupe in town. It's said to be fantastic I've bought tickets for you too Tonight...? I've got to meet a friend tonight I want to say something to you today Go ahead today and say it today Maybe later "Your guests are waiting for you. Where are you hiding, Sapna?" When will you come out? After I have left? "When you leave... I will miss you""" "When you leave... I will miss you""" "To placate my heart, show me a way""" "Give me a picture of yours before you leave""" I have a dream Like a rose among thorns I have seen a masked face "l dream, I have seen" Tell me how my dream will end "Give me a picture of yours before you leave""" Before I turn helpless... and drift away from you Before I am shattered... before I turn helpless "Tell me what destiny holds for me""" "Give me a picture of yours before you leave""" There are cheats "Dark secrets they hold in their hearts""" "They have ways of playing with you""" They are cheats "Give me a promise before you leave.."""' "give me a picture of yours before you leave""" "When you go away, I will miss you""" "You checked this pocket, Sapna. Not the one behind" "The story begins here, all right. But it doesn't end" It takes a twist The police bring handcuffs. Not engagement rings I'll fetch handcuffs too. _ So bring that first Why keep up the pretense? Handcuffs I bring aren't meant for these hands But you can certainly lead me to him Durga Prasad. D.P. "He keeps no secrets from his secretary, I'm told" "lnspector, this is my house" "lf you want information about my office,.."' please call on me there Durga Prasad owns a shipping company which does not possess a single ship The poor have put together every penny to buy shares worth millions And he has swallowed all their money D.P. is involved in several other illegal businesses He's an influential man who enjoys the protection of big guns... it isn't easy to catch him. An ordinary police inspector has... been entrusted with the task of getting evidence against D.P. And you must've thought I'm an ingrate... and tried to exploit me "lnspector Dharam Dev, I have respect for my boss" I have nothing against him. Please leave my house Inspector Dharam Dev will leave your house Forever. But Dharam will never be able to leave your life Will you meet him tomorrow evening? - No He'll wait for you "Take it for granted that you've got a loan of 4 million, Durga" I'll get you all the licences too But I won't settle for a 5 per cent commission this time Well...? _ 10 per cent That's too much. Don't be unreasonable "Business is bad nowadays, my friend. And I've got to provide for my family" I can't protest when you talk about your family Let's shake hands Haven't you brought your wife? - I want to have fun this time But it's a shame that despite having friends like you... I'm so lonely on evenings like this. _ Really? Wait till I make a call No. I'm only kidding "By the way, you had a beautiful secretary, didn't you?" I still do "You aren't involved with her, are you? - No"' But I could set her up for you. _ That's something Give me a share for hundred rupees. - When hundred can be two hundred... five hundred could be a grand! So give me three shares. - Good. It'll make six "Think about it. In a couple of years, the value multiplies to double!" This is fantastic! It's up for grabs. Go for it! "Salutations, lady. How many shares do you want to buy?" I've already bought them. I've come to return them God forbid! You want to sell the shares when the prices are increasing! My daughter has her exams and I don't have money for her admission I don't want any profit. Please have my money refunded "Shares can't be taken back, lady _ Please do something.."' I'm a poor widow. Please have mercy on me Widow...? So come here... You're young and beautiful... and a widow at that! "On a personal level, I will help you" Let me have your address. Which lane...? "Marina Building, Nagpada" Khan saheb... _ Coming Don't worry. I'll come over Sapna! What are you doing here? "l want some advise, Khan saheb. - Sure. Go ahead" I have some money. Since profits are assured... why mustn't I buy some shares in our own company? "Thank the Lord that you have some money, my dear girl" Put that money away in a bank The guys buying shares in this company are going to be ruined A hundred rupee share They won't get a penny back I must leave now. Meet me later... and I'll tell you where to invest your money The poor have put every penny together to buy shares of this company And that man has swallowed all their money "My promise, I must keep" "l must keep my promise, I must go.."""' "My promise, I must keep" Listen... - Yes? Come on inside. I've got something important to discuss with you. You talk to her everyday. Give me an opportunity to serve you today "Come... _ Now listen, wives" The two of you can sit down and have a chat today I'm in a hurry He seems a changed man today. _ He used a perfume today For the second time in my life. - When was the first? When he married you I think he has found another woman. "Since you insist, I'll keep the money as a loan" "lf you take me for your own, you mustn't return the money" Well...? "l mean, only the one who is slain, knows what he's going through" "You mean, you're a widower?" I'm worse off. I have two wives... but I still thirst for love Khan saheb... - Listen to me! "Whenever I see a beautiful woman, I lose control" You haven't introduced me to my child... where is she? "Salma... _ Yes, mother?" Pay your respects to uncle Salutations Salutations... What happened? "This is my daughter, Salma. She's studying to be a nurse" Praised be the Lord! The mother is cupid... and the daughter's an arrow What luck! "ls there any more work, sir? _ Yes, Sapna" Here are some confidential files. Don't let them remain outside "Should they fall in wrong hands, they could cause great trouble" Put them away in the safe "You trust me a lot, sir. _ undoubtedly" So why do you hide Mr X from me? _ I don't. He prefers to remain hidden Why? "As you know, we have to do strange things to make money nowadays" I also have to tie up with shady characters Mr X is one of them. His real name is Jagmohan A very useful man in Delhi Why don't you meet him? - l...? I was about to ask you to take this important letter to him I can't ask anyone else to carry it. Deliver it to him on your way D.P. sent you to me...? Sit down. I'll join you soon Help yourself to a cold drink. You'll find it in the fridge I... - Don't be formal "Get me a Limca, if not one for yourself" Where could D.P. be? - I don't know He has left the office "Sorry to bother you, could you bring my drink here please?" What a wrong place to put the mirror in. "Shut the door, and you can't see anything"' What a refreshing drink. Try a sip... No thank you. Here's the envelope. I'm in a hurry Hurry...? You're doing an injustice to me I've been awaiting you since yesterday _ Did you know I was coming over? "Hasn't D.P. told you, I'm an old admirer of yours?" D.P. asked me to give you this envelope. That's all Even a peon could have fetched this envelope Out of my way! - What airs! "Now look, miss. Your boss lives at my mercy" "To keep him in good spirits, it's necessary to keep me happy" Is this your idea or is it D.P"s? We agree on most of our ideas Stop putting on these airs. I'll ask D.P. to give you a promotion "She's punishing me for hurting her feelings, Braganza" But I haven't really betrayed her. She will come... sooner or later. And I will wait for her The sweet fruit of waiting... there she comes You're still here? _ Didn't I say I'd wait? I wasn't supposed to come today. _ But you did What do you want to know about Durga Prasad Nothing. _ Nothing? "lf I have to pay with the relationship I share with you,.."' I don't want to know anything. _ But I want to tell you everything Here you are That safe...? How do you open it? The combination is... "Where to, mister? You aren't allowed inside in the night" Security! Where did that man go? _ Which man? I saw nobody He came in right now He must be inside. Get him! This is the first time a woman has attended to this house What's that in your hands? _ That which I wanted. Durga Prasad These papers will be a handcuff for him I've done what you wanted of me. I must leave now "Leave, and the house will be filthy again" So hire a maid-servant. - I'll hire two Provided you take the responsibility of handling them I don't trust policemen. _ I'll quit the services I hate jokes. _ Do you like diamonds? "Wear it, if you like it" I'll take it now and wear it when I feel like it "lnspector Dharam Dev, there has been a theft in my office" Go and lodge a police complaint. _ lt'll take things too far It isn't right to discuss such things in police stations "l know, everything is up for sale in the world you live" But I also know that lnspector Dharam Dev is not one of them "lnspector Dharam Dev, my name is Durga Prasad" They call me D.P. You can either be a friend of D.P. or an enemy There're no relations midway "The name is Dharam Dev, you can call me D.D"' But we can't ever be friends Think it over. Enmity could cost you dearly Tough luck. I joined the police force so I pay heavily I'm glad you don't have any wife and kids Or I'd have sympathised with them "Rajesh, guess what I have in my fist?" I have proof that will send him straight to prison "I'm coming over, in case you're going to be there" I'll need your help to prepare a case "Come over, sir. I'm very much here" "lnspector Dharam Dev, for being drunk on duty and causing an accident.."' you are sentenced to two years of rigorous imprisonment How did a two-year term get over in just six months? You have well-wishers in the police force Although they couldn't prove your innocence... they do know the truth So you are an lnspector now? - Yes... I have followed in your footsteps. _ Don't do that. It'll take you... right inside the prison. _ They're doing their best... to take you back in the force. - Soon? As soon as they forget that I'm a disgraced man? People in the department are very embarrassed They need an excuse to summon you back in the department I must've lost my house? - No. The rent is being paid every month _ So what other favours have you done? "Don't call this a favour, please" Will D.P. be in his office right now? _ Your house has been locked up Let's go to my house first. Freshen up and I'll drop you later "Drop me at D.P"s office. _ Now look, you.."' "Else, I'll go on my own. _ Get in the jeep" To D.P"s office You'll need the money. Treat it as a loan No Just one bullet. It can do no harm without a pistol Treat this is a loan too Whom do you want to see? "I'm back, D.P. To ruin your sleep" See this? It's a bullet It has your name written on it "lt'll remain near my heart, till I lodge it in yours" Later Mala...? I've got to meet you Afternoon. After he goes to sleep _ My place? "He's okay, he's having his breakfast" "Yes, he's taking his medicines. Very well, I'll tell him" Who was it? - The doctor Hasn't Roshi woken up? - Woken...? "She'll ask for breakfast, when we've had our lunch" She came in at 4 this morning. _ Why don't you reason with her? "lf I do, I'll be called a stepmother"' "Your darling daughter, after all. Go ahead and pamper her" Deal cards for me too "Jingle, Roshi wants to gamble" "Why not? _ The club has boycotted you, Roshi" Know how much you've lost? 60000 "Till you repay the debt, you won't be allowed to gamble" Your father's a rich man. It's no big deal. Just pay up "One day you will fall, Roshi. And you will be tainted for life" Which is why I ask you to stop following me I'm not your types "You can be my types, Roshi. Just give up these vices" Give up these vices...? So what will remain then? "Roshi, you will have enough. I'll make a new person out of you" I don't want to be a new person. _ I'll come in uniform someday... and handcuff all those bastards who sell narcotics... and spoil the younger generation "Will you take me away too? _ You, I'll take away right now" Let me go! - You'll crash somewhere in this state So what will you lose? _ You're going to lose Get in. I'll drop you home "Eat something. _ There's a blot on my name, Sapna" I can't wash it away until I have tainted Durga Prasad with it "l used to work for him earlier, so I could earn a living" But now I work for him so I can destroy him A foreigner named John is leaving for Switzerland tomorrow "He won't be searched, but his bag will be stuffed with foreign currency" It's D.P"s money. This is how he has siphoned off all the money abroad I want to meet that gentleman Arrest him Come on What you did was wrong! Wasn't John Benjamin a dubious guy? _ All right Wasn't he carrying foreign currency? _ All right Wasn't he into illegal things... _ I agree... He was carrying D.P"s money! _ We don't have any evidence on that You will keep looking for evidence and he will flee the country "l assure you, we will not let him run away!" "Till such time as you are reinstated, leave all this to us" "Or you will do something illegal. _ You are bound by legalities, not me" And D.P. is my enemy John Benjamin was caught. He was carrying foreign currency Won't you bail him out? - What rubbish! "Stop following me, or I'll have you arrested" All that is old hat. Wait and watch. I'll have to personally leave for Switzerland. In a day or two "Why don't you understand, darling? It could result in heavy losses" I'll try and return as soon as possible Book a seat for me on tonight's flight "I'm sorry, Mr Durga Prasad. You can't leave tonight" "Why not? _ You owe taxes in excess of 600,000" "What's 600,000? I'll have it paid tomorrow" So you may leave tomorrow. _ My office is here... No point in arguing. You can't leave today Here's your ticket. _ My passport Your passport remains with us. The moment you pay your taxes... it'll be returned to you Why was my passport snatched away? _ There are greater dangers ahead Clean out the office. You can expect a visit from the cops And let's act as if we don't know each other for a few days "Did you send for me, sir? _ Yes, Khansaheb.."' "l want to be left alone with him, Sapna" Shut the door and come over "Khan saheb, difficult days ahead" Here are some important files. Take good care of them Go on leave "You're ill, all right? _ I'm ill, of course"' I suffer from cholera. >From Malaria Missus! Attend to me immediately! "ls that okay, sir? _ Absolutely" Don't worry "Those papers are more precious than my life, missus" Take good care of them. Here are the keys. Good bye Where to...? You said you were on leave. Let's play hide_n_seek. You're a grown up woman now. And I'm stricken with Malaria I'm going to the hospital "Salma, what's the programme for this evening?" "Anything. _ In which case, let's.."' Where can I find Salma? "uncle, aren't you overdoing your rounds to the hospital nowadays?" I feel giddy nowadays. I come for a cure Who was that boy? - Aslam? He works with me. _ Why does he? "l mean, I don't like to see you mingling with strangers" "You don't like it? _ I mean, you won't understand it" Youngsters nowadays treat women like playthings They play with them and dump them. To understand women... "one needs the experience. Experience, that comes with age" "Dear uncle! _ uncle, my foot!" "Forget uncle, just call me ""dear" "- Dear?" Something similar... Get home early in the evening. Your mother worries about you She could contact T.B... Strange old man. Who's he? _ Strange man He was angling for mother earlier. And he's now trying to woo me "Well...? _ Nothing here, sir" "lf I'm not needed around here, may I go out for a while?" Nobody leaves till the search is in progress You...? - Wait and watch the fun We found nothing in his office to implicate D.P. Which means he has hidden away the evidence elswhere It's okay if you can't kill him. "But break his limbs, so he can never walk around again" Okay? _ That's just what we'll do Listen... I'm not through He carries in his pocket something he's arrogant about Near his heart... a bullet I want it What's a bullet? _ Don't you know? "Have you ever seen a pistol? _ Sure, I have" The slug in a pistol is a bullet I'll wait for news at Golden Bar till midnight One of you will deliver that bullet to me It'll tell me that the mission has been accomplished Where did you get that imported cigarette from? I bought it. - But I smoke this lndian brand This is what you smoked earlier. - Now I smoke this All right One hates being a burden on others "Times have changed, Dharam. You will start earning soon.."' "and I will enjoy it. I'm earning today, so you must enjoy it" You consider yourself a burden today. I might be a burden tomorrow A new line of thought... I'll think it over Look after yourself. D.P"s seething with rage That's because he can see his imminent death Hurry up "For your entertainment, we present a special item today" "Look, what is this...?" "it has your name written on it""" "Blissfully ignorant, you are. Getting drunk too""" "One day, this bullet will pierce your heart""" "Now watch the fun, my friend.."' "Look, what is this?" It's a cure for your heart It bears your name "This is the thing you are scared of""" "l look for you, and you look for this""" "Look, what is this...?" You know what it is It bears your name "Remember this much, O crazy one.."""' you are a moth "You will burn in the fires you have yourself started""" Watch the fun... What is this...? "ls it a reward? Or is it a punishment?""" It bears your name too "Mala, I need money. - How much?" "600,000. A million, if possible" "Which means, I'd have married a pauper if I had decided to marry you" The old man isn't dead either. You said he's ailing from every disease That he'd leave millions to you What we want and what happens are two different things "Even if the old fossil dies, what will we get?" He'll leave all his money to his daughter To hell with his money I've stashed away over 10 million in Switzerland. It's all yours My problem is that the guy I had appointed to look after things... is in police custody. If I don't reach there immediately... I might lose the money. "Because of Dharam Dev, everyone suspects me here" "unless I pay my taxes, they won't let me go" "600,000 is all I need. It's chicken-feed for the old man" "That's okay, but he's a tight-fisted man" "lf he discovers his money has disappeared, it'll kill him" Can't you bring him around...? Shame on this beauty of yours So show me a way. _ That's like my girl "Come, let's make love and make some plans which will.."' eliminate Roshi from your way and Dharam from mine Roshi is not back yet - Roshi indeed! You'll die for her. _ She's the only child I have "How am I to blame, if I don't have a child?" Why don't you take Roshi for your own child? I will. I promise. But you will have to help me How? _ The scolding she gets from me... "she must get from you. I'll pamper her, like you do" She'll take to me gradually and I'll reform her All right. Let her return today Is this any time to come home? "Those who live by the clock, forget what life is, daddy" And when they realise what life is... they're heart_patients... Iike you are Such insolence! _ And what is good manners? To speak lies as if it were the truth? "You mustn't be so angry, daddy. You mustn't be up at this hour" "You mustn't spoil your sleep, trying to reform a spoilt daughter" You should have slapped me when I smoked my first cigarette I was only eleven. But you didn't even have the time to look at me You ought to have slapped me when I had my first boyfriend I was only 14. But you had no time for me You ought to have slapped me when I first lost a gamble "l was only 15, but you didn't have time for me" You ought to have slapped me when I took the first narcotic pill "The first time I smoked pot, I was only 16" But you had no time for me even then I'm 19 today. Thousands of joints flow in my blood_stream Boyfriends have come and gone I've had any number of narcotics "I've lost 60,000 in gambling. I still owe the money" And you find the time to slap me today You have atleast paid attention to me "That's not true, Roshi! I've never loved anything except you" You have never loved anyone or anything except money I spent my childhood craving for love And you lusted for money all your life "And you think of me today, because you see death ahead?" Because you have no other heir? But I hate your wealth as much as I hate my own life! "ln just a year after you're dead, I'll squander away all this wealth!" Because this money of yours has ruined my life! Do not say things... that lie in the heart In these things... there is no substance This is how I lead it "Life is a poison I am drinking""" "ln slumber, I have spent days and nights""" After I am drunk... I'm reminded... "of all those things I had forgotten""" A spell is being cast... Flames leap in my body... they engulf my heart Behind my eyes... Iie hidden many a secret After I'm drunk... I'm reminded... of things I had forgotten Your daddy was very severe on you today But every word you said to him was true He's such a rich man. And his wife and daughter crave for every penny "Have one. Come on, don't be shy" How much money have you lost in gambling? 60000 _ You want that money? Where will you get it from? _ Do you want it? "You can have even more _ Yes, I want it" I need some money too. And we can help each other "How? _ Give me a smile, I'll tell you" Let's enact a drama to relieve your dad's safe of some money Zafarullah Khan has the evidence the police are looking for And why not? _ What nonsense are you talking? "Salma's like your daughter. _ But she's your daughter, lady" She's the one who excites me. She's my heart-throb! She'll rule the roost! _ Oh yes... "she'll rule the roost, and I'll starve" You must put up with it for your daughter's happiness "A day or two of difficulties, I'd put up with" But this is for a lifetime "Had you proposed marriage with me, I'd surely have thought about it" God! A son-in-law is like a son! It's a sin to even think like that I'm looking for someone like Aslam... "who will look after both, daughter and mother" That beggar? He'll starve. And Salma will starve with him! "lf you're such a big man, I'll give my daughter to you" "Pay me 50,000 rupees _ 50,000...?" "Yes. 50,000. _ 50,000...?" "50,000? Where am I going to get so much of money from?" Who's that...? Who calls me when I'm overcome by worries? Good folks share their worries. _ Right now... "I'm worried about 50,000. Now tell me what you're worried about" You have something I don't have. _ I have something... "which could be worth 50,000? _ You have something.."' that could be worth hundreds of thousands of rupees You have some files... - Files? Who the hell are you? Who told you about me? I don't have any files. You're trying to buy me out! Good bye "Do you have 50,000? _ Do you have the files?" "l will tell you when you show me 50,000 rupees" Good bye "Between my hands and D.P"s throat, there's 50,000 rupees" "Had I some land or property, I'd sell it to buy Zafarullah" I feel scared when you speak like this I'm scared you might do something reckless Do I know you? _ I know you You were in the police force and later in prison You are now unemployed and needy You are brave and trustworthy. You could be of use to me I live over there. Could we sit there and talk it over? If you want to make a hundred thousand rupees in a couple of days... come over to the Picnic Cottages in Juhu at 4:.00 p.m. tomorrow "Roshi, this is Dharam Dev" You won't actually have to carry her away She'll go with you of her own volition You will call her daddy and tell him that his daughter's in your custody You will ask for a million rupees in ransom I'll handle the rest. The million rupees... will be delivered any place you ask for it You will take Roshi to a travellers' bungalow near Khandala tomorrow night We will meet here on the night of the day after... "and split the money between us. Roshi and I get 450,000 each" "100,000 goes to you. Roshi will return to her father, hale and hearty" That's the way we make the dough Mom can't explain. My daddy's a bloody miser We have to enact dramas to get a hundred bucks out of him So we hit upon this plan to keep us going for a year or two Do you see the plan then? _ It's a joke for the two of you. But I could be imprisoned for it. "He can't do it. _ Quiet, little girl" "Penning poetry, already?" "Whatever we have done was a practical joke""" "Dharam Dev is not responsible. I hatched the plot""" Could you sign this please? "I'm a very rich man's wife, Dharam Dev" If people get to know I play such jokes on him... "what respect can I command? _ You're no less, mummy" Give that to me. Why be afraid when nothing's going to happen? Tear it up later. Okay? Here's a thousand rupees. Arrange for a car It isn't settled yet. I've got to sort out a few more things We must trust each other. Suspicion will lead to more suspicion Whose lipstick is that? The mother's or the daughter's? Which lipstick? This one _ That girl is a wild cat And you intend to spend a night with the wild cat in the forests? "What if she devours you? _ Not a bad deal at 100,000" "50,000, I will pay Zafarullah"' May I tell you a secret now? Mr Ghanshyamdas's wife Mala is having an affair with D.P. Really? How do you know? I've dialled her number several times. They talk lovingly for hours "Secrets being unravelled indeed. The money will go to D.P.,.."' "he'll pay his taxes and vanish. _ Don't get involved in this, Dharam" "Someone else will, if I don't. The money mustn't go to D.P"' But it stinks. And they could even be conspiring against you I must get involved to know what the conspiracy is I need your car for two days. _ You may have the car But think again. _ You're unduly worried Roshi's going to the movies with her friends Very well "Listen, come home after the show" "Come here, dear" Go Give me my ticket. I'll follow you in my car I've got to run an errand for mummy. "Come soon, or you'll miss the beginning" Where are you going? _ To steal. Are you standing guard? Yes. Do I take you away then? - Sure. Where will you take me? To the police station? I could have you live in my heart "For that, you must come of your own volition" "Well, what do you say? _ Forget me, Rajesh" You will never see me again. _ Why? I'm leaving this world. - This world...? "l mean, this world of my daddy and mummy" I'm going to America. It's all been arranged "With only a bag? _ No, you idiot!" "I'm going to my friend right now. For America, I leave later" "Let me drop you. _ No, I'm going close by" Get on with your beat Don't you feel any guilt to cheat your father like this? It was Mom's idea. _ But you're getting half the money I want to go away to America. And daddy won't send me away Your daddy's an ailing man. Suppose something happens to him? Nothing's going to happen to him He loses millions in business and doesn't even bat an eyelid His problems have begun since he has fallen in love at his age Mummy keeps him in a spin "Put your husband on the line, lady" Who are you? Is this any time to call? My husband is asleep. _ Wake him up... or he'll sleep forever. _ What nonsense are you talking? Who is it? - Some insolent man! Mr Ghanshyamdas? - Yes? "Keep this to yourself... or else, you will lose your daughter" Who's this? _ I want a million rupees I'll call tomorrow evening and tell you where to deliver the money Keep the money ready. Or you will have heard the last of Roshi... Daddy! Save me from these thugs! "Roshi, where are you?" "Leave me alone, you thugs! Let me talk to my daddy!" Silence! "Leave her alone! Let go of my child, you thugs, rascals!" What happened? Tell me something Licence number? - MRJ 9318. "Yes, you have a booking. Mr and Mrs Sandeep Kumar" Your mother's a strange woman. Why did she make a booking for man and wife? So nobody would suspect us. If you don't use this bed now... they're surely going to suspect us. "All right, you can at least sit on the bed and chat with me"' How are we going to spend the night? I have a headache. - Headache? I have a miraculous cure Open your mouth. - What is this? Swallow it... it's an English pill. Water... You don't need any water. It'll melt in your mouth Why did you take it? - I have a headache too What pill was that? _ Giddy? It happens in the beginning. And then the headache vanishes... as if you didn't ever have it Take a drag. - No I have my own cigarettes. _ Try mine. Am I not a friend? Take a nice drag Slowly and stealthily... "who else is in this room, apart from you and me?""" "Who called him...? He came uninvited""" "Catch him... who's the thief?""" Slowly and stealthily... "who else is in this room, apart from you and me?""" "Who called him...? He came uninvited""" "Catch him... who's the thief?""" "Where is he...? - Over here""" "Here...? - There...?""" "up there? - Down here?""" "Where...? - Here...?""" There's no one here This window's open It was shut I felt like some fresh air "You ought to have told me... I was willing""" "Modesty came up like a wall between you and me""" "Forget all this and think.."""' "you're quiet and I'm quiet. So who's making all the noise?""" "Who is it...? _ It's only a curtain""" "My heart is beating, I'm in a playfull mood.."""' I wish we were left alone tonight "Between the two of us, we'd have kicked up a storm""" "Whatever else happened, we'd surely have fallen in love""" "What a nuisance! He's so shameless,.."""' "Who's this here who's boring us...?""" Who is it... who...? "It's me, of course" Slowly and stealthily... "who else is in this room, apart from you and me?""" "Who called him...? He came uninvited""" "Catch him... who's the thief?""" "Where is he...? - Over here""" "Here...? - There...?""" "up there? - Down here?""" "Where...? - Here...?""" There's no one here No one... Strange night! How about your headache? - Headache? Go and freshen up. You've got to call Daddy "Call your daddy, right?" But I've got to call him in the evening This is Ghanshyamdas What have you decided? The money is ready. Where is my daughter? She's safe and sound. Satisfy yourself "I'm okay, daddy. But come and take me at the earliest" "Of course, dear. I'm coming over"' And Roshi... I'll never hit you again Never "Forgive me, my child" "Do not be disheartened, sir. Roshi will soon be with you" I'm demanding money from you because I'm helpless "Someday, I will explain the whole story to you" "lf possible, I'll return your money too" Where have I to send the money? _ You will bring it personally All alone. You will drive your car at 40 kms per hour... throw the bag outside and drive on "ln two hours, Roshi will return to your house" Where? _ On the highway at Goregaon... there's a road that leads to Mulund. Drive along that road... till you come across a torch flashing on the left Mummy must be arriving. I'll wait with her I'll go and fetch the money Have your taken your glasses? Why do I need the reading glasses? _ Carry it. You might have to look at things closely. I'll go and get it No. I'll go and get it myself "Speak up, Roshi... say something!" What happened to you? Who was it? "Need something, sir?" "Do you have a match? _ Yes, sir" Here you are Got you "Why're you scared? I'm here to catch a police officer, not a thief" Let's go to the police station Switch off that headlight first What crime have I committed? _ You've been missing since yesterday The police department has been looking for you What for? What have I done? - Must I record... all my statements right here? Won't you save something for the station? The Commissioner's waiting for you. Let's go The Commissioner? At this hour? - You know how it is "When it's something important, the Comissioner can't tell night from day" What can be more important that the officer who was jailed by mistake... is being called to resume his duties with due respect today "No... _ This is a joyous occasion, sir" The commissioner wants to himself make you wear your belt again Injustice was done to you. But now I can surely say... that justice is being today We can't celebrate the occasion with whisky in this office How about a sherbet? "Dharam, you are one of our brave officers" You can look after yourself in every adversity I hope you will be a better officer than you were earlier "l will do my best, sir. - I have no doubts" There was another reason why I came here at this hour of the night Mr Ghanshyamdas is an old friend of mine Someone kidnapped his daughter last night "Out of fright, the poor man did not even inform the police" He even gave the thug a ransom of a million rupees "But when his daughter still did not return, he telephoned me" "Dharam, I want you to handle this case" "lf need be, you can take Rajesh's help" Dharam is returning to duty after many days. Make sure you're with him Poor Ghanshyamdas. He won't be able to sleep tonight I told him I'd send someone over. The two of you go and visit him "Sir, the police are here" "Sir, I'm Rajesh. This is lnspector Dharam Dev" He's incharge of this case. - Please sit down May I have a glass of water? "Will you explain it to us in detail, sir?" It happened the day before. We were eating at that table... and Roshi left with her friends... Roshi... my child... I didn't look after her well. Or I wouldn't have to see this day You didn't come there? - Where? To collect your share. - Share? What share? Don't act innocent. I have the letter with me Any letter that will prove where Roshi is and with whom... who was the one who kidnapped her for a million rupees... and where he is hiding her... "should you have a letter like that, give it to me, lnspector" That letter will prove his crime Can you take us to the place where you dropped the bag? Here Wait... foot_prints Mustn't have been a very smart man Look at this This is where he must have sat waiting for the money Here you are... - Let me see Charminar? "Tyre_marks, sir. New ones. Leading up that lane" Take photographs "It's an easy case, sir" Looks like he arrived in a small imported car I think it was an MG. Not more than 2 or 3 in the city I don't think he knew he was committing a crime Or he wouldn't have left so many clues "The night of the day before, I can understand" Where were you last night? _ Since when have you been waiting? Why've you walked here? Where's the car? It stalled on the way Don't lie. The car's in the garage. I saw it in there You've been spying on me? "You're not in trouble, are you?" Your face says it all I've got back my job. And I'm already handling a complicated case Won't you tell me about Mala and the million rupees? "Sapna, let's meet this evening. I'm in a hurry right now" All right. Give me the keys. - Sure... "Why don't you leave the car with me? _ What is it in the car, Dharam?" "Sapna, come here" Go home. And don't try to meet me for a few days "lf someone asks, tell him that the car has been stolen" "You've landed yourself in trouble, haven't you?" I'm not going home till you tell me! "l don't want you to sink with me. _ If you sink, so will l" Do you think I can live without you? Listen to me... - You listen to me! Tell me what happened. - Later Now! Right now! "That kid, Roshi.."' someone has killed her Every clue points to me. Dharam! I warned you _ Her body's in the boot "lf I don't find the killer soon, I won't be able to save myself" Why's the body in the boot? Why's the car in the garage? It has stalled! _ So repair it "l will! Go home! _ I'm not deserting you, Dharam!" You know what will happen to me because of you? "Because of me, you'll have some help. Come on... come!" Start the car Okay Wait here. I'll leave the car in the forest Sign here "Birbal... _ Yes, sir" Relay the message on the wireless. If anyone has spotted a white... "imported car, licence No. MRJ 9318, the police station be informed" We're looking for a car like this one in another case We'll surely find it Why didn't you report the theft yesterday? I first thought a friend is playing a practical joke on me "l looked for the car all day. _ Anyway, we'll keep you informed" Here you are Imported car? All right. I get it I'm glad you're here. The car we're looking for... passed by New Bombay's toll station twice. Let's go Why're you wearing dark_glasses? _ I didn't sleep all night My eyes are burning What happened? - We've checked all hotels "Let's check this traveller's bungalow _ No, he mustn't have been here" What's the harm in looking "Come here. _ Yes, sir" You're the caretaker here? - Yes. Recognise her? _ She was here the other night With her husband. - Husband? They had a booking. The register even has their signatures You can take a look Did it appear as if that man had abducted her? "No, she was happy to be with him" "Could you recognise the man, if you saw him?" Why not? He looked like you "ln fact, he was more like him" Go and get the register. - Follow me Go on "Any news? _ The car has been found, sir" Where? _ In the jungles A police party is awaiting you "Shall we go, sir? Or would you like a drink?" Let's go "Kasim, has anybody messed with it? _ No, sir" Ask them not to move around. We'll find his foot_prints "Forget me, Rajesh. You will never see me again""" "Why? _ I'm going away""" Did you know her? - Yes He took a million... and killed the girl! "The killer can't escape, Rajesh. I won't let him get away" You're right. The killer can't escape "Because I won't let him get away _ Sir, come here" "Look at this, sir" The murder took place in Picnic Cottage She must've tried to resist the killer "Foot_prints, look" See...? Here they are And what is this...? Charminar A packet too This is Charminar too He must have gone in that direction. Take a look... I'll go and enquire at the Picnic Cottage "Sir, I want to go there too. _ Let's divide our work, Rajesh" We'll wrap it up much faster Dharam Dev...? Cottage 8 was booked in the name of one Mr Dharam Dev Did he personally make the booking? _ I don't know. I wasn't on duty then. Who paid for him? _ Looks like it was paid in advance A woman paid it? - I don't know... "l could find out, if you wish. _ It's okay" I'll have to take this register to the police station for a few days Okay. But what is the case about? - You will soon know That lnspector has taken the register away. How can I help you? I came for the register too. But it's okay Since when has this gentleman joined the police force? Do you know him? - Of course He was put up in Cottage No. 8 two days ago This gentleman? No way... You must be mistaken "Not a chance, sir. I personally lit a cigarette for him" He came in a white car. - A white MG? An imported small car You said in the report that you don't have a garage to park the car You park it on the road. _ Right But you must be locking it? - Sure And you locked it that night? - Of course Do you have the keys? Yes This is where I keep it. Could you have forgotten to lock the car that night? No. I don't normally forget... _ You could've forgotten that night Or perhaps left the keys in the car itself? "l don't normally forget, but... _ Maybe you did, that one time?" Could you have lent the car to a friend... and forgotten? Are you kidding me? Do you know someone by the name Dharam? "Dharam...? No, I don't" You must know that I have a chemicals manufacturing factory too Set fire to this chemical and you can get the stink far away I thought the rascal would certainly burn the bag... after taking out the money. So I emptied an entire bottle in it "lf D.P. gets his hands on the money, he'll pay his taxes" "lf you get to know about it, call me on this number" "Go the Reserve Bank immediately and have 600,000 deposited there" Take the receipt to Mr Ghosh at the passport office Show him the receipt and bring my passport Call Mr Gupta. Book a seat for me to Geneva on the flight the day after tomorrow I'm calling from D.P. Shipping Corporation "Mr Gupta? Yes, this is Sapna here" Mr D.P. wants to leave for Europe the day after tomorrow "Could you book a first_class seat for him, please? To Geneva" Has the money been paid? - Yes So he has got the passport? - Almost I'll have the ticket collected tomorrow "It's done, sir" He has gone out. - Out...? Maybe you haven't recognised me. - No Haven't you ever been to the office with Mr Zafarullah? What would women like me do in the office? "No wonder you don't recognise Durga Prasad, your husband's employer" "You, sir? My husband's boss? - Yes" Please come in. _ I'm in a hurry "Actually, I had given Zafarullah some files for safe_keeping" "Yes, and he gave me those files to be put away safely" I'm here to collect those files. _ I'll get them immediately But I won't let you leave without having the sherbet I prepare My husband will be angry What happened? I don't know if I will be able to return from Europe anymore I have some very important documents lying in Zafarullah Khan house I must have them collected Mr D.P. came here personally? _ Oh yes "He sat down, had a glass of sherbet and then went away with his files" How did you recognise him? Was he a tall man? "Yes, he was. _ Did he sport a beard?" No. - No?! Was it him...? No. Who's this rotten man with a beard? This rotten man is the one who's going to have me shaved! Khansaheb... _ My Lord! Here's my shoe. Be my guest I'm in a hurry. I don't have the time for jokes "So give me fifty blows! _ Come to your senses, Zafarullah!" I'm here to take my files away. _ I get it. Fifty blows won't do "Hit me as much as you will, sir!" "500 blows, 1000, 2000... here's my head!" "What happened? _ Not my mistake, sir" My second wife is a bit naive. - What has she done? "She gave the files away, sir. _ Gave away...?" To whom? - I don't know! "So who knows, idiot! _ I'm suffocating, sir" "Spare my life, please! _ Spare you?" I might rot in prison because of you! _ Oh yes... no! God will help you! _ Help me? Pray to God that He helps you! At least let me check where you are hurt You can't... call Salma. She'll check it out She'll know where I'm hurt What drama is this? _ Go and lend him a soothing hand He's stricken by you. _ Shut up "Your passport has arrived, sir. _ Lovely. So I can leave tonight" Trouble time. D.P. has got his passport And he's planning on fleeing the country tonight itself Don't worry. D.P. can't go anywhere now Go home and rest. I'm not going to find any time today I had kept that bag here Where has it gone? "lsn't this bag, is it?" There were a few blood stains on it which have been examined in the lab It was Roshi's blood It had the killer's finger_prints whose pictures have been taken I know those hands very well This is the shoe whose prints we found earlier This is the cigarette packet and cigarette butts... I found in the criminal's house Here are the keys of the car in which the body was found And the car belongs to the killer's girlfriend It wasn't stolen at all Handcuffs >From you I learnt to be a good officer "Now tell me, what can I do except this?" "You need something more to arrest me, Rajesh. A warrant" "With the killer in front of him, a cop doesn't go fetching warrants" You will have to. And I'm in uniform And I'm your senior. _ You can report me... "but I will not let Roshi's killer escape, sir" I won't let Roshi's killer escape either "For that, I need time today"' If I still don't succeed in clearing your misgivings... I'll hand myself over to you. This is a promise to a friend. ">From one officer to another _ For two days, you've been fooling me" I trusted you and you kept making a fool out of me! I'm not falling for your trap again. Give me your hands "My hands, I won't extend. You will have to use force" Stay here Your officer wants you upstairs Yes? D.P. has sent for me. Tell him that Dharam Dev is here I'll check if he has left. Please stay here Who is it? Put Mr Gupta on the line I have a ticket for the day after. Can I fly tonight? The day after...? Who's this? - It's D.P. here What ticket are you talking about? Sapna spoke to you this morning. _ Sapna did? Not at all I've just arrived in the office. - What nonsense! She kept uttering your name over the telephone "Sapna, do you know someone by the name of Dharam?""" "Listen, I must fly to Geneva tonight" Book a ticket for me on any airline There's a Swissair flight at 00:.30 - That will do I'll collect the ticket at the airport "ln a tearing hurry, D.P.?" How will I manage without you? - You? How dare you come here without permission? Don't you like my uniform? I came to show it to you You think you get into a respectable man's house anytime you wish? Get in and even search the place. Provided he's a respectable man "Like you, D.P"' You need a Search Warrant. Do you have one? Such formalities between friends! Come on... I didn't ask for warrants when you shoved a live man before my jeep I didn't ask for it... even when you made me swallow a whole bottle of whisky I didn't protest even when you implicated me for Roshi's murder Such things happen between friends But it's unfair of you to swallow a million bucks all alone Now tell me where you hid the bag? _ What nonsense are you talking? You seem to have escaped from a loonybin Didn't I say we shared a one_sided friendship? "lf you refuse to help me, I'll have to search for the bag on my own" You couldn't even hide it properly. _ Why should l? There are so many bags here. This is just another Ghanshyamdas was right when he thought... the killer would try to get rid of it once he had got the money He thought the killer would try to burn the bag... so it would be destroyed "You're lucky you didn't try that, or you'd have been caught, D.P"' That old fossil is a smart man. Know what he did? He put some acid in it which would raise a stink How about checking it out? Enough. It'll destroy the evidence Keep a watch on lnspector Dharam Dev and Sapna's house Dharam... You're back? So you're the snake in the grass! Rajesh! - Yes? Something's burning in there What stink is that? _ Something's burning in there Something's burning in that house We must check. The fire could spread There's someone lying there. Carry her out... come on! Fetch some water. Quick Sapna! What happened to her? "She was lying unconscious, while this bag burnt in your house" Your house was full of smoke. _ Luckily we reached in time Quick! Take her to a hospital Such a stink in this little bag? Strange Watch it... it's very hot Follow that cab "Yes, Latif? _ lnspector Dharam Dev.."' has taken a girl to Bombay Hospital What name did you say? Sapna...? What's the surname? Not Sapna. It's Roshi Ghanshyamdas Room No 437 I want to talk to your husband He can't take the call right now. What is it? I can talk only to him. It's important Call for you Who's this? _ We have found your daughter She's in a critical condition. She wants to talk to you I see... but where is she? Come to Bombay Hospital immediately. Room No. 437 Room's in the name of Roshi Ghanshyamdas 437...? "Mala, Roshi's alive! Anybody there?" "Go on, Mala" There was a call from Bombay Hospital. That's where Roshi is In Room No. 437 _ lmpossible She wants to talk to her father before she dies "This is a trap, Mala. _ When you saw her last.."' had she really gone to sleep? - Almost Almost? Not fully? _ She had shut her eyes "And I had to leave, when I heard a car approaching" You've ruined everything "Don't do something silly, Mala. She can't wake up so easily" Ghanshyamdas is rushing to the hospital "Get there before him, lest it spoils things for you and for me" I want to talk to the special nurse in Room No. 437 "Sorry, sir. We can't call anyone from the fourth floor" Listen... could you please tell me who's in that room? We've given her the oxygen. There's no danger anymore She can regain consciousness any moment now What's your name? - Vithal "Any other vacant room around, Vithal? - The one at the corner" Help me shift her to that room "It's against the rules, sir. - Leave that to me. Come on" Roshi Ghanshyamdas? - Yes "Come on inside, Rajesh" You're bang on time "Good, you've got these too. The real killer will soon be here" "Whether someone comes here or not, you can't leave this place surely" You have that bag in which the money was supposed to be? It had nothing but scrap. _ Right. This is the bag which contained the money It's the same kind of bag. How did it get burnt? "We'll talk later, Rajesh. We have very little time" "Roshi's killer is already here. Anytime now, he'll enter this room" I've sent rumours to him that Roshi Ghanshyamdas is lying in this room That she'll reveal the name of the assassin when she regains consciousness The killer will never want her to regain consciousness "On the contrary, he will make another attempt to kill her" Ask your men to hide. He might smell trouble and go away Listen... Salma... What are you doing here? "You, sir? What are you doing here?" A friend's daughter is lying ill in Room 437 So let's go and find out how she is The girl's mother doesn't like me Doesn't like you...? She's a stupid woman! Go to the room and find out if she's all alone... or if there's someone else too "Like a storm, I will go and come back" Nobody must get to know what you're doing there "Nobody will get to know, sir" "Like a thief, I'll go. Like a cop, I'll return" Please let me go "Halt there, or I'll open fire" I'm down here "Don't move, lnspector. Your life is in my hands" Freeze! I have nothing against you. But take a look at what I'm carrying Each grenade can explode Want to see? See? So many innocent lives in this hospital "Let me go, if you care for them. Let nobody stop me" "Latif, let him go" Don't anyone follow me. One grenade is enough to blow up this building I'll kill everyone if I have to die Hold it Back off! "The joke's on you, D.P"' Your grenades lie wasted. And an empty revolver does the trick for me This one isn't empty "Will you move back, or must I open fire?" See what this is? It's a bullet It bears your name It was lying near by heart... Ionging to be lodged in yours "l regret, I'm in uniform" It's against the law to fire at an unarmed man The law will deal with you I hope you will surrender quietly and not compel me to use this bullet You ought to have brought the handcuffs "Please don't embarrass me anymore, sir" You're my senior officer "Sapna, why did you come up here? _ Are you okay?" I'm okay and so is everything else is also okay
