Are you sure this is-- [SHOUTING] will you shut up a minute? You're sure this is the right road? Tony, let me navigate. Wilderness weekend, huh? [SIGH] I bet it snows. This isn't good for my ovaries, Sid. Ever since that trip to the abortion clinic, your reproductive system has been very weird. I know she stole one of my chocolate bars. Thought I wouldn't notice that, you thieving little witch? I sure did, Sidney. Is that all you think about, is chocolate? Don't call me Sidney. Nobody calls me Sidney except my mother and Oral Roberts. No. Mostly I think about Frank Sinatra and Novocaine-- Asshole. --but I needed chocolate for my energy. Energy for what, Sid? Energy for making you my own, my little vixen of love. No way. [INAUDIBLE] of that, I'll never get. Boring. Life doesn't agree with you. [GIGGLE] Do you need any help? No. We can handle it. Just keep straight. It's about three miles down the road. I'll keep you inside anyway. OK. [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You were heading for the Sweet 16. We're showing off in real good style. Fashion. The beauty queen. Well, now I wish you were just a dream. Do what you want to do. You do what you want to do. Hey, it looks deserted. The brochure said that-- Forget about the brochure, Sharon. Look, I guarantee you this is going to be a weekend you'll never forget. Just so's I can use my canoe. Yeah, OK. Kayak, kayak. Could you check me in at the camp? I'm going to cruise around for a little bit. Yeah. Don't get lost. [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] [GROAN] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] If she's wondering-- Look it, look it. [TIRES SCREECHING] Tony, why the hell did you stop? To support our boys in uniform. He's cute. Why not? He's my honey. I saw him first. You won't know what to do with him anyway. - Hey-- - Come on! --what do you think you're-- Come on! Are you heading up there? - All the way. - OK! - What's your name? - Ben. Hey, guys. His name's Ben. SID: Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, your beret's really neat. How do I look? Like a rubber. Up yours! TONY: Don't let them fool you, Ben. They love each other. I'm Tony. BEN: Hi, Tony. And that blob over there, that's Sid. - Beware-- - Hi. --of the blob. I creep! And there's Tracy, and-- Me, Cissy. Hu-man. And I'm Carol. You live around here? Uh, yes. I was born here. Yeah, right over there. You can still see the stain. - Shut up, Sid. That's blood over there. TONY: Well, that's perfect. You know any place we can stay? BEN: Yeah. Well, my father runs a campground, but I don't know whether you'd like it though. It's right in the middle of nowhere. Nowhere-- that's great. We just love nowhere. So Benjamin, huh? What do you love? You mean besides "Miami Vice"? TRACY: And I saw him first! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR REVVING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [MOTORCYCLE ROARING] Yahoo! This place is great, you guys! It's unreal out here. Yahoo! Welcome to the quiet majesty of nature. And to think that I forgot my tux. You don't need one. And by the time we leave this place, I'll have made a real man out of you. Sharon. Did ole Scott tell you he'd turn you into a real woman? Only on Tuesdays. Oh, then put me down for the rest of the week. - What are you doing here? - Hi. I'm Dave Calloway. We just thought we'd camp here for a couple of days. The camp is closed. Are you serious? Do I look like I'm talking for my health? Hey, pal. You got a problem? No, no. The gentleman was just saying that-- JULIA: It's all right. - --we-- My husband was just saying you're welcome here. [TERSE] Julia! How many times have I told you-- [RV APPROACHING] BEN: Mom? Ben! [BEN LAUGHING] Mom! Hello, Mom. How are you? - Fine. How are you, honey? - You look great. So do you. Hi, Dad. Will ya look at him. How you doing? [ANGRILY] Who the hell are they? They're friends of mine. They're going to be staying with us for a few days. Well, you don't mind, do you? Let's go inside. I'll see you guys later, all right? Welcome home. Pitch a camp wherever you want to. Bye, Ben! - Go Miss Addams and family! - Nice place. It's Addams family over there. You're a bum, Ben! [WATER RUSHING] Ah, shucks. I lost it. Something scared it. Something, uh, down over there. There, look. Campers. I didn't know the Ritchies had the gall to go and reopen their camp. In fact, they didn't. Well, then, what are they doing here? What do you care, Doc? Huh? We're in a democratic country. Everyone does what he feels like, and that's just the way I like it. Yeah? Well, you know what I think about democracy, let alone campers. It's an old story. Just forget it. You think it's OK to leave the stuff here? Yeah, sure. Oh, it's your stuff. What do you think, the engines had garages and padlocks? I wonder what it was like out here a hundred years ago. [MUSIC PLAYING] What's the name of the fat guy, again? Sid. Sid. [YELLING] Sid! [CLANG] What is this? How do you like it? Not very much. There's more than a dozen out there. It's like a minefield. W--What'd you set all these traps around the house for? Because I'm going to get him. Get who, Dad? The old Indian shaman. He's out there somewhere-- [PORTENTOUS MUSIC PLAYS] --and I'm going to get him. The old Indian shaman? He's back. [PANTING] Hey! Look! Must be somebody's old hunting cabin. I hope we're not trespassing. Nah. She said as the doberman ripped her to shreds. [GIGGLING] Come on. Don't be silly. It's probably just a wood shed. Not bad, huh? Nah. Hmm. Looks deserted. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, sheer luxury. What a pity. I wonder why the heck it was ever abandoned. TRACY: Obviously a bad investment. Carol? [MUSIC PLAYING] [HOWLING AND YELLING] Now, this is what I call livin'. Oh, yeah? Hunting, fishing, the great outdoors. Do you really think the kayaks are safe? Come on. You're worse than your Aunt Maureen. So what about it? No, you go ahead. I'll catch up. [INAUDIBLE]. Hi! SCOTT: Softie! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] No! Ah-- no! No! Ah, ah-- Scott?

[THUD] [POUNDING] [YELL] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MONSTROUS GROAN, MIRROR SHATTERING] [SCREAMING] [ROAR] [SLICE] [MUSIC STOPPING] [LEAVES RUSTLING] Hey. I thought I told you not to set any more traps around here. You're going to get somebody hurt. This is my property, my land, and I do what I want to. If somebody gets hurt, that's their problem. You better watch your damn mouth. No, you better watch yours! You don't think I'm onto you after all these years, Charlie? You don't think I know about you and Julia? She doesn't give a damn about you. She's mine! If you don't back off, I'm going to kill you. Hey, the day you try that, you're going to be a damn dead man. Good seeing you, Robert. Oh, by the way, there's, uh, a lot of kids around here. Anything happens to 'em, I'm going to hold you responsible. [ENGINE REVVING] [MUSIC PLAYING] So what's your favorite music then? I adore [INAUDIBLE]. - Who's that? - He's the greatest. Yeah. It's good listening. I love Iron Maiden. Where's Sid? Yeah? There's Cissy! [INAUDIBLE]. Wow, those smell great. Can I have one? - Hold it. Yum. The biggest, naturally. [LAUGHING] Forgot the mustard. Uh, it was only a hot dog! Maybe that's why she's so pissed off. [GULP] See how you do it, Tracy? I missed. You know, you don't have to swallow, Cissy? Oh, you are so foul! Stupid kids. I knew I shouldn't have paid any attention to you. They're nothing but trouble. I should have kicked their asses out of here in the first place. They're friends of mine. Friends? [MUSIC PLAYING] Like what you see? Eh, she's all right. Does she have food at her house? For some of us. I've got a job for you two. There's a bathhouse or something over there, but it's filthy. Why don't we clean it up? Not now. Yes, now. And tomorrow we can all take a shower. I took a shower when I was a kid. Yeah, and you smell like it too. [WIND BLOWING] Where's everybody at? OK, guys, where are you? Nice place. You guys, come on out. Joke's over. I know you're here. OK, guys, where are you? Come on out. Wh-- What, are you back here? Great. Come on. Jokes over, all right? [ANIMALISTIC GROAN] [LAUGHING] Oh, baby. I wouldn't hurt you for all the tea in Lipschitz. Sid, you idiot. [LAUGHING] CAROL: OK, OK. Here we are. There's still work to be done. SID: Come on, Sissy. Cheer up. Tony? SID: You look like you burst your bladder. Whatever you say, [INAUDIBLE]. CISSY: Oh, shut up, Sid. [SPLASH] [LAUGHING] There's a couple happy campers. [SPLASH] [SPLASH] [HEAVY BREATHING IN SLEEP] [SLAMMING] BEN: Hello? Hello? [MUSIC PLAYING] Tracy? It's me, guys. Anyone in? Tony? What is it we're playing? I know you're here. I heard voices-- [BREATHING] Cissy? Cissy? Cissy? Cissy? [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [SLAM] Ah! [BUBBLES BLOWING] [SPLASH] [PANTING] [WHISPERING] Robert-- [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] Robert! Robert! Robert. Robert. [GASP] It's OK. It's OK It's me. It's me. Oh, Charlie. What are you doing here? I had to see you. You shouldn't. Robert's out here somewhere. He wasn't in bed. The hell with Robert. Why in the hell do you stay with him anyway? Because he needs me, and Ben needs me. Ben's a grown man. Hey, you're still a young woman. Beautiful. Come with me. [GASPING] I'm afraid. I'm afraid he'll kill you. No, he won't. I'd kill him first. [PANTING] [CREAK] - Is someone out there? - Nobody there. Come here. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [SLAMMING] [SCREAMING] CISSY: What's the matter? TRACY: Carol! CISSY: For God's sake, what is it? Sco-- Scott! You think Sharon is still down there someplace? Nah, I doubt it. Where could she be? Probably lost in the woods. What's the word on Scott? He's in the hospital in a coma. Now, don't worry. I'll send a couple of choppers in here. We'll find her. Yeah. The Aspen Squad. I know those guys. They're hot. Just call the A-Team up. Guys, stick around. I might need you. Sure thing. We're not going anywhere. [SID COUGHING] You better watch your mouth. I'm allergic to police. Ah, shut up, Sid. Any hope, Doc? These dumb accidents. This was no accident, Ted. What do you mean? I can tell you there'll be more killings. Come on, what are you talking about? Who's going to be killed? My daughter, Rose, was not the only one to be murdered. Remember Bob Bates and Pamela Hicks? SHERIFF: Sure. A bear got them. DR. OLSEN: Hmm, that's what everyone thought. They had an argument that Sunday about Tom. Fuck Tom! Fuck-- Ah, fuck off. [SLAP] Fuck you, Bob Bates! [MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE] [WINCING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Bob? Can you hear me? Bob! Quit fooling around. I want to go home. Bob? [MUSIC SHUTTING OFF, BOB YELLING] [BOB GROANING] [GASP] [MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [BOB GRUNTING IN PAIN] Bob? [BOB CHOKING] No-- no! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh, no! [CRYING] Ah! TED: You talk to Charlie about this? I don't trust that man, Ted. Sorry. I've changed jobs. Going to dinner. There's a killer out in those woods-- a heartless, bloodthirsty monster. I have to admit, Ted, you have every right to shove your head in the sand. But pray this doesn't reach Denver, as well. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] [LAUGHING] Doo, doo, ah! Doo, doo, ah! Doo, ah! Doo, ah! Doo, ah! Do you ride as well as he does? Fair. Hey, twinkle toes, come on! Wow. Take a look at Dave. Look, Cis, it's Sharon I'm worried about, OK? Is there anything we can do? So cool it. Tell us about the murder again. Well, this girl was killed here, and the murderer was never found. Was about 12 years ago. And that means the murderer could still be around here. Will you stop it, please! [MUSIC PLAYING] Hi. Oh, hi. Mind if I join you? Oh, sure. Why not? I can't stand certain people. Any news about Sharon? No. I hope nothing's happened to her. Sharon's a pretty tough kid. I think she'll be OK. Do you know Sharon well? Yeah. O--Oh, she's not my girlfriend. [GIGGLE] Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. It's awfully silly. No, no-- you don't need to apologize, really. Look, I-- I thought I'd take a ride and have a look for Sharon. Would you like to come for a ride? OK. Tony, stop. I got to talk to you about something. Remember back before the Civil War, when we was picking cotton with the Negroes? A similar thing is happening right now. Dave is stealing your woman. Hi, Trace. Maybe I got other plans. Maybe I got other plans. Maybe I changed my plans. CISSY: Hey-- BEN: OK, yeah! I got it. - I think that's great. There's 1, 2-- I'll be out of your way in a second. BEN: What? CISSY: Ah, ignore her. She's just jealous because she doesn't know how to play. [CHUCKLING] Ah-- anyway-- Hey. BEN: --3, 4, and I win. What are you doing here? CISSY: Sure do. [BEN CHUCKLES] BEN: Um. would you like some grape juice? Sure. I'm going to take a shower. Did you say something? [SARCASTICALLY LAUGHING] Legs up! Woo! Ah! Hold on! You OK? Yep! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING GIBBERISH] [SINGING] Summer time, summer shine. The winter time-- [THWACKING] [BRANCH SNAPPING] [THUD, CRASH] Hey, anybody here? Come on, you guys. Stop fussing around. I'm getting pissed! I'll say it again-- I'm getting pissed. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [MUFFLED YELL] [YELL] [MUSIC QUIETING] Not bad. Not bad at all. I should have known it was you. What do you want? I'll give you three guesses. I could be letting myself in for one big disappointment, couldn't I? Or one big surprise. Hmm, how big? Why don't you find out for yourself? I'm curious. [EERIE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CREAKING, SLAMMING] Did you hear that? Yeah. [PANTING] There's something behind the wall. Watch it. You hear that? Like somebody panting. What do we do? It's not a real wall. There's a room back there. So what do we do? You go outside and wait. [STARTLED YELL] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [THUD] [CREAKING] [YELL] [WHISPERING] T--Tony! Tony! Tracy? Where are you? [TRACY GASPING] Tracy? [BANGING] Tracy, are you there? Tracy? Tony! TONY: Hang on, I've almost got it! TRACY: Wha-- [GROWL] [YELLING] No! Jesus! Come on. You're never going to make it. - I can't! You know I'd never lie to you-- - I don't want to do this. - --except one time. No! I never lied to you. I'd never lead you astray. Sid, you know we've been friends-- You lie to me all the time! There's no orgy. Ben's parents live in there. I know-- There's no orgy in there. Sid-- if there weren't an orgy in there, would I do this? [GULP] [SHOUTING] Help! Can anyone hear me? Help! [INAUDIBLE]. [SHOUTING, CLANGING] Holy-- Cissy, I'm going to-- she did it to me again. Cissy! I think I'm going to kill that kid. I think he's going to be home soon. Cissy! I almost killed myself in there! [MUSIC PLAYING] [PANTING] [GROANING] [YELP] [THWACK] [TONY SCREAMING] [THUD] Here, come sit. Morning. Have a sit down. No. Right there, in front of you. You guys were all in on it? You were in on it too, Dave? It's OK. I'm not pissed off. It's very funny. Your dad thought it was hilarious, running into his kitchen naked. He's not a fun guy to begin with. It doesn't matter. What's for breakfast? Hey, guys. Where's everybody else? I don't know. Getting laid, unlike Sid. [GIGGLING] Damn it! Why is everything always directed toward me? Every shot-- I've been-- [FRUSTRATED YELL] My only private-- [YELL] Hey, Sid! Fuck you! [CHUCKLING] I think he's really pissed off, you know? Where were you last night? Looking for you. [SPORTS GAME PLAYING ON TV] I'm leaving. So after all these years, Charlie finally talked you into it. Is he really better than me? [WHISPERING] He has nothing to do with it. What about this place? What about the camp? What ab-- [YELLING] what about Ben? What about me? It was time I start thinking about myself. Julia, you've always thought about yourself. You never try to understand my problems, how hard it was for me to love you knowing about him! I really did try to understand, but he's the only one who ever showed me any affection or any love, and I really need that. Something warm between your thighs. Get your mind out of the gutter! You're a whore. [SLAP] [YELL] Please, stop! You're hurting me. Robert! Shut up. [CRYING] [SHOUTING] Shut up! Just stop-- Shut up! [THUDDING] [SOBBING] [CLANGING] [PANTING] Ro-- Robert.

You scared me. How long have you been here? Well, I just got here. Been alone? Yeah. [INAUDIBLE] What did you decide to do? Are you gonna go with me? I don't know. I haven't decided yet. I know, it's a tough decision. What's the matter? Nothing. Come on. I know you better than that. What is it? Nothing. Really, nothing. What's the matter? He's been roughing you up again, hasn't he? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Let's get out of here. [YELLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] You shitheads! [LAUGHING] Look at those assholes! [INAUDIBLE]. [LAUGHING] Well, look at this. Look it-- damn, look at Sid.

[SOBBING] SHERIFF: I tell you what, it'd take one hell of a psychiatrist to figure out why Ben did it. Sheriff, how many people did Ben kill? So far, the coroners found the remains of 15. So he really did kill that girl a long time ago? Nah, but he knew who did it. So that and the curse of the old Indian shaman probably did the rest. Sheriff, do you need us for anything else? No. You can leave any time you'd like. Thanks, Sheriff. [SHOUTING] Robert! [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] I know you're out there. [SCARED MURMURING] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] [THUD] [MUSIC PLAYING]
