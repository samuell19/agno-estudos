Stars up above me, stars in my eyes. Fire below me starting to rise rise. I'm my own captain, hanging on tight tonight. Pointless to try and turn back the time. I've never been this old in my life. Load up my spaceship, tear through the sky I might. I don't want to wake up and let my dreams-- You ready? Bro, always. That's good, man. That's good. You ready? No. No? No. Man, my batting average has been terrible these past couple weeks. Bro, you got this. I can barely get basketball. You got this. All right, all right, all right. Dude, you're awesome. All right. Whatever. All right. Hey, listen, I got to go class. I'll see you at practice, right? See ya. I'm young, wild and alive. Oh, my goodness. Hello. Well? Well, what? OK, aren't you excited? Oh, you mean excited for the biggest baseball game of my entire life? Yes. Yes. Do you also want to walk me to class? You don't mind if I do. Let's go. So here we are. Sorry I have to say goodbye. OK, it's time for class. Awesome. Hello? I'm inside the Toyota. Hello? Oh, hey. Hello. How are you, buddy? I'm doing good. I understand you work on veterans cars for free. I do. Yeah, I do. I do. I've got a Mitsubishi that needs brakes and maybe rotors. Man, I want to help you brother. But I got five cars ahead of you. I'm busy. All right. OK. Wait, hold on. Hold on. All right, how about this, come Monday, early Monday. And when I say early, I mean 3:00 AM. Will that work for you? Yeah. OK. 3:00 AM, right here, I'll be here. Come quietly. Let's not wake up the neighbors, all right? OK. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you very much. Yeah, yeah, no worries. Sorry. But we'll do it. We'll get it done. OK. Thank you. Thanks, buddy. Who was that? Who? That was a guy who-- Needed a brake job. Yeah. Well, he's going to need rotors, too. So honey, tell me, what did you learn in school today? So see, it's like a butterfly. And it has all these pretty colors and these swirly antenna things, and they're so pretty. They come from like caterpillars I think. Yeah, we learned about it in school today. And it's so pretty, right? Honey, they learned about butterflies today. Tell your dad how a butterfly is born. So basically, it starts out as a caterpillar. Then it goes into this nest thingy. It comes out as a beautiful butterfly like a miracle. A what? A miracle, daddy. There's no such thing as miracles, honey. It's OK. It's OK. Two outs with men on first and second. And number three, Bryson Wheeler is up the bat. Good. Come on. You got this. Go, Bryce. Come on, B. Good eye. Good eye. Good. Yes! Let's go! He's safe. The Dons win. The Dons win. Atta boy, B! Let's go. It's just a headache. I mean ice your foot I think but your head, too? Is that worse than the foot? Do you want to lean on me? Sweetie. And more water, I think you didn't drink enough water. I probably use more water more. Bryce. Dad. Check out this truck. Oh, my goodness. What's this? This is sick. Incredible, isn't it? Can I take it for a drive? No. What are you encouraging here? You can hug your old man. Come here. I'm proud of you, man. Thanks, dad. Well, I'm going with dad No. You mind taking my bag? I'll call you later. Yep. Get some food. Why is he showing you trucks like that anyway? I don't want crazy. Mom, it's a cool truck. Stepping on a rock, we're just going to-- No, it's fine. OK guys, settle down. All right, let's get back into catechism 162. Here we are reminded to live and grow and persevere in the faith until the end. We must nourish it with the word of God and beg the Lord to increase our faith. It must be working through charity, abounding in hope, and rooted in the faith of the church. What it means is that we must stay close to the word of God and depend on it, the Bible, right? So by working through charity, we can encourage others. And guys, this doesn't just happen in this classroom or when you go to church on Sunday. It happens when we go out in the world and we leave the building. Let's look at Hebrews 12, 1-2. Therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us-- Thomas. I'm sorry. What's going on? He's kind of-- Brycen, you OK? I just got a nosebleed. Here. Run to the restroom, get cleaned up, OK? Thank you. All right. OK, guys. Can I tell you something? Back in the day, I would have taken them all off your hands. It just-- Georgia doesn't seem right. Apparently, this place is an embarrassment to the city. You got to get rid of everything by the end of the month. Listen, if I don't get rid of them, they will. I gave a lot to the fire department to practice on. Dude, I would help you out, but Marilyn would kill me. Wait a minute. What is this? Are you kidding me? Is this a '67? Are you kidding me? '67. You like her? Do I like her? Yeah. George, this was my dream car. I'll tell you what. Take her, my gift to you. Come on, you're kidding. She's yours. OK. Just don't tell Marilyn, all right? You got it. Come on. You ready? That was pretty good. What? Getting out of class. Dude, what are you talking about? Nosebleed. Hey, did you pick one out just to get out of class? Dude, seriously? Bryce. Are you OK, man? It just slipped out of his hands. It's OK. Check out these shirts I'm going to get the boys. Why does it say touch down with a baseball player? Well, because most of the boys play football and baseball. And I thought that'd be fun. Yeah. How about something that says state championship baseball? Well, I already ordered them. Ooh. Ooh. Hey, Bryce, you all right? Bryce, are you OK? Hey, honey, can I give you a hand? What? Just wondering if I could help you out. Well, you do know I'm working tonight, right? I do. Yes, I do, of course. That's why I'm-- that's why I'm trying to help you. What are you doing? Putting stuff away so that you can get out of here faster. And what are you doing tonight? Me? Tonight, I have a very calm night plan. I'm going to relax, sit down, watch a little TV. Good. Good. And just work on that car that George had to get rid of, had to get rid of. Ed Hanson. Do I need to remind you that you've had major surgery, two major surgeries in the past month? You know what, Ed, just a couple of repairs for friends, perfectly OK with that. But this, come on, Ed. Marilyn. What? Honey, it's a '67 Mustang. No, a '67, that's my dream car. You've heard me mention it a million times. And you-- now, hold on, you being an oncology nurse should consider this as my own cancer project. What in the world are you talking about? Rust. No, rust is the cancer of the automotive world. It's terrible. It eats away at the engine and the organs of-- I love you. Oh. And don't forget to take your medicine. Yes, mother. Did you call mom? I did. I did. I texted her. Hello, Mr. Newman. The nurse said you blacked out at practice. Yeah. Headaches. Are you getting plenty of fluids you know with this heat? No, doc, no. It's not the heat. This kid's been playing baseball since he was 8. And if it's not baseball then it's been football. It's not the heat. His files are good, strong heartbeat. I'm not hearing anything to worry about. When the body gets dehydrated, sometimes the brain shrinks from loss of fluids. Why don't we try some Tylenol, get plenty of fluids. And if it continues, make an appointment with this pediatrician. Sound good? Yeah. OK. You're a healthy kid. You'll be fine. Thanks. OK. Let's go. Let's go get you some food. OK, I'm starving. There you go, bud. Excuse me. Sure. Dad. Dad. Dad. Yeah. My head is killing me. Yeah. So was it-- did you just get dizzy or-- Just hurts. It just hurts. You're back. Yeah, yeah, we're back. Look, doc, I know my son, OK? And there's definitely something wrong with him. Mr. Newman, migraines in young people is very common. At his age, the sports, puberty. Puberty? Did he take anything? Yeah, I gave him a Tylenol. I can order some tests, take some blood. But I really think that this is just-- where does it hurt? In the back. Give me a minute. Be right back. I'm going to punch her. No. No, I'm going to punch her. Puberty. I got a kid, was here earlier. OK. Dad's over concerned. He's complaining of headaches, blacked out of baseball practice. Yeah, sounds like heat exhaustion. Let me take a look. That's what I said. All right, let's get him some fluids. Can we start a DHE drip? And if it persists, then let's order a CT scan. I'll go talk to him. And I don't know about this, Bryce. Dad, I'm feeling better. But the doctor said he wanted you to get some rest. I did. No. Sitting on the couch, playing Xbox for two hours is not getting rest. I can't miss practice. If I miss any more than that, I won't be allowed to play. We got the state champs in, what, like two weeks. Fine, fine, fine. Just be-- be careful. I will. Don't worry. All right. What do you say, Jack. Hey, what's going on, bro. Oh, let me get my bag. Be careful. OK. Sounds good. So what time does he get home then? OK. Yeah. Just make sure he stays there. Oh. Thank you. Not a penny. Brakes, rotors, even tuned her up. Yeah. So as soon as I get out of here, tell him to come pick him up. He said, he's just a veteran that wants to help people out. Yeah, OK. All right. Bye now. Hey. Hey, excuse me. How's Brycen? Sorry. I heard he passed out at practice. He pretty much spent the whole night in the ER. Oh, my gosh. Is he OK? Migraines, that's basically what they said, heat exhaustion. What they give him for that? They gave him some fluids, Tylenol. They ran a CT? No, no. They said that wasn't necessary. He started to feel better. OK, Richard, I'm not trying to get all involved here. But a good friend of mine is the head of neurosurgery. Neurosurgery. What-- no. Yeah. No. I'm just saying. I know. I know. No, he's-- he's feeling better. OK. Thank you, Sue. Yeah. It's like they're not even trying. Yeah. Hey, good to see you, bro. I have a test. It's very strange. You have stupid hair. It's fine. Would you please-- Right there, I fixed it. Hey. Hey. Hey, bud. You all right, man? What happened? They said he passed out at school. And what are the doctors saying? They don't know. OK. Hey, Sue. It's Rick. I need your help. OK, let me see. We can't just find that part. I just thought of a few other things, because when I told you that come by, I forgot that-- and I-- well, those don't come cheap. I understand. Yeah. And then I had-- OK, there you go. There you go. There you go, buddy. $1? Why $1? Because I do what I can for my veteran brothers. And anyway, the money can't hug you back, right? See, look, check that out. That's a work of art. Sir, thank you, sir. God bless you. And Semper Fi. OK. Take care. And remember, if you hear the knocking, just call me. Yes, sir. I did the best I could with my limited resources. How are you doing? Hey. So you're the guy that does the repairs for $1? Yeah, for veterans. Do you serve? No, no. Sorry, sir. My name is Miles Himmel. I'm a local news reporter. OK. Wait, Larry, your dad? Yes, sir. Sorry to hear about him. Thank you. Good man, good reporter. Hard to hear what happened to him. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Yeah. So you volunteer to work on veterans cars? Yeah, when I can. Hey, do you think that maybe I could ask you a couple questions? Miles, I don't really think that I'm much of a story, you know what I mean. Anyway, it's nowhere near as important as what these guys have done for our country. Well, maybe I could ask them a few questions. Well, they're shy. Sir, thank you. Sorry to waste your time. Oh, no worries. Thank you. Take it easy. Mr. Newman. Yeah. Hi, I'm Dr. Getty. I'm the chief of neurosurgery. I'm the one who's going to be operating on Brycen. I'm sorry, what? What did you just said? The scans showed that he has a large tumor in his head. Is it cancer? Well, we hope not. But I do think you need to prepare yourself. Prepare myself? For the possibility. This is serious. Oh, it is-- it's serious. You think so? Yes, sir. Mr. Newman. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, doc. I just-- Did Sue Wilson called you? Yes, she's a-- she's a dear friend. OK. Does Bryce know? Can I see him? Yeah. He's being prepped for surgery right now. And when I told him, he just said, that's fine, just sew me up tightly, I've got a plane to catch in two weeks for the state championship. Said, I can't let my team down. Yeah. That's him. He's a-- he's a tough little bugger, catcher. I'll take you to him. OK. Show me something positive anything. Come on. Hey, there. Got anything for me yet? Hey, Kurt. Yes. Yeah. Working on this, I think it's a good one. Yeah. I'll let know as soon as it's done, maybe a little more time and send it your way. All right. Mr. Newman, I can assure you he is in the best of hands. Thank you. I'll give you a minute. Hey, guys. I'm sorry. Do you think there's a chance that we could get a-- just a minute alone with my son? Thanks. There he is, my main man, huh? Hey, dad. I love you. Love you, dad. So looks like they're going to have to operate. I heard. Don't worry, dad. It's just a brain tumor. I just want them to get it out, so I can be on that plane to Sacramento, got to play that game, dad. I love you. I love you too, mom. Excuse me. Are you ready? I love you boy. Bye guys. Look at you. You are a filthy disgusting mess. I know you what think. You think I'm going to change every spark plug, every gasket, every hose, but I'm not. I'm going to rip you out of there, and I am going to replace you. And then you will be gorgeous. Brycen's parents, can I speak with you, please? So I want to let know we got it. But it did turn out to be a cancerous tumor, medulloblastoma. And he did very well. So I think he's going to be all right. We'll see. OK. OK. Thank you. I'll be speaking to you guys tomorrow. They got it. Honey, I couldn't sleep. Ed, the car that I saw, is it really your dream car? Well, I'll be honest with you. It's more like a nightmare car right now, because I found a lot of rust under there. But it is going to be cherry I promise. Is this all of them? Sure. I know you, Ed Hanson. You got all of these and probably a dozen more being delivered in the middle of the night. You would do anything for anybody. And I love that about you. But you need to take care of yourself, too, OK? Please. How can I tell these soldiers who have given so much, how can I tell them no? I know it doesn't make sense. But you have to understand that it doesn't matter if you fought in Nam, or you fought in Bosnia, or Iraq, or Afghanistan, if you weren't married or had kids, the thing you talked about all the time was your car. It's a car you're going to buy, the car you're going to fix up, the car you're going to drive around, see the world. I know it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes the car was the thing that kept it going, kept you alive, make sure you got home safe. OK. Mr. Newman, hi. Hey. Dr. Getty said the surgery went well, right? Good. How's he sleeping? It was a little rough. It's to be expected. Well, his color looks good. Mr. Newman, Brycen's latest blood test indicated that he's got a staph infection. It's probably from the surgery. We're going to have to clear that up before we get into radiation. So it's going to delay it just a little bit. Radiation? You said you got it. There is a small area of enhancement, but it looks like leftover scar tissue to me. Really, I don't think it's anything to be worried about. All his vitals look great. He's doing well. He should be waking up soon. Thanks, doc. Well, if you need anything at all, just give me a buzz. Thank you. Thank you. I'm impressed that you went ahead and did the t-shirts. Yeah, aren't they cool? You know, cool would not be the word I would use. Well, no one else has one like it. Yeah, that's because no one wants one like it. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Seriously though, man, I love you. And I'm-- I really appreciate your friendship. Well, I love you, too, man. How's Brycen doing? Oh, man. I don't know. It's surreal. When I was a kid, you get a staph infection, it's like a little bump, right? And it goes away. That thing almost killed him. But he's-- he's better now. Well, I want you to know I've been praying for you. For me? Yes, you and Brycen of course. Well, I appreciate it, Mike. I do, man. I'm just glad that it's all behind us now. You know what, I'm going to go listen to this voicemail, OK? OK, dude. All right. All right, take care. Hello, Mr. Newman, this is Dr. Getty. I've been trying to get a hold of you. It's important. Can I see you in my office tomorrow afternoon to discuss Bryce's latest scans? Hey, if we get everyone to come over here. We got some awards to give out. All right, so we have several awards tonight. But I want to start with a really special award. This is called the Coaches Award. And this award is given every year to a player that shows tremendous courage, really puts the team before himself. And I couldn't be happier that this young man was able to join us tonight. This year's Coaches Award goes to Brycen Newman. You got it, buddy. Thank you, coach. Florida. Congratulations. Well deserved. Love you, pal. Thank you, coach. All right. There was an area in Brycen's brain that had what I believe to be scar tissue. Nothing about it indicated that it was cancerous. However, it is a tumor, and it's growing. No. I'm sorry. I'm confused, because I remember you coming downstairs and saying that you got it. Do you remember that? Yes. That was you, right? And one of the kids in the waiting room got it on video, right, said, that it's gone a virus on TikTok. I know. I did get the area that I wanted out. But this is a very aggressive form of cancer. No, no, doc. No, no buts. No. Mr. Newman. No! No. No. I'm sorry. So what now, radiation or-- No, I have to go back in and get it. What? Come on, doc. Look, I'm not putting my kid through that again. Look, I want a second, a third, and a fourth opinion. I understand. But whatever you decide, it has to happen rather quickly. Would his body even be able to take that? Brycen is a very strong kid. You people are unbelievable. What's going on? Oh, it's Brycen Newman. His tumor is back. And his prognosis is not very good. God bless them. Yeah. Dad? Hey. Hey, bud. I thought you were asleep. Got a headache. Are you OK? It's gone now. Dad, what's wrong? They didn't get it all. No way. No way. What's next? They want to go back in. I'm so sorry, son. I just-- I hate that this is happening to you. And I wish I could trade places. And I pray, I pray every-- every day-- Dad. Every-- Dad. So they have to do it again? I'm OK with that. Yeah. I love you, buddy. Love you, too, dad. You're the strongest person I know. It's gonna be OK. We'll get through it together, OK? You're going to be just fine, dude. I know. What am I missing at school? Nothing. Coach has us conditioning for the season. It's not too late. The formal dance is coming up. And you're my date. No, you're my date. Oh. I am so sorry to interrupt Mr. Newman, but there are a couple of people here who would like to have a word with Brycen if that's OK. Who are they? They're from the Make-A-Wish foundation. Bryce? Yeah. OK, I'll send them in. Lady. Hi, Brycen. It's so nice to meet you. My name is Heather, and this is Linda. And we're from the Make-A-Wish foundation. And the hospital has been sharing with us about some of the struggles you've been going through. So we're here to see how we can help maybe grant a wish. A wish? Yeah. I can wish for whatever I want? Yeah. Dude, you can get an island. You can get your own island. I don't know, man. Do a movie. All right, make them cast you in some like Chick Flick. And you get to kiss a celebrity like Selena Gomez. OK, OK. Calm down. Dude, you should wish for an autographed Tom Brady football or what about a ski trip dude for 24 closest friends? Do I have to decide now? No. After the surgery and we'll be here. I hate to break up this party, folks. But I'm going to have to ask you all to leave. I have to get Brycen ready. Bye guys. Hey, God. It's me Rick. Brycen's not in the room but you know who is, the God that we believe in. These are the moments, right, where we have to ask ourselves, what do we actually believe, where the rubber meets the road for our faith. And we can't heal him, but we know the one who can. Philippians 4:13 says we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us. In other words, what we cannot do, He can do. And what does God do? Well this book is filled with stories of miracles and signs and wonders and miraculous healings. And Hebrews 13:8 says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. That means this is either a book of stories or the God who did it then, wants to do it again. Yes, we need a miracle. Let's pray. God, I don't know if you can hear me, and I don't know why you did this to our family. But I'm asking you to please, please be with my son. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. We come to you right now. We ask you to move the heal Brycen from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. We ask for a miracle right now in the name of Jesus. Please, please be with us. There he is. Here's my beautiful boy. See you. Hey. Hey. How you feeling? We know we miss you at school. We? OK, I miss you at school. Alex, they still didn't get it. OK. Listen, I don't know about the dance this year. OK, I want you to listen to me when I say this. We are going to that dance. And if you think cancer is going to have anything to say about that, you better think again. I know I promised you the first dance. I think cancer's saying no. Well, then I guess we're just going to have to get a higher power involved. Let me guess, my mother. No. No, I'm calling God. He trumps even your mother. You're such a dork. Kind of kid he's always been, sports, cars. Yeah. Mr. Newman, how Brycen feeling? Well, we're going to have to start radiation and then after that, several months of chemotherapy. Is this tumor ever going to go away? You say you got it. You don't got it. It's shrinking. It's growing. His numbers are good. His numbers are bad. I just don't know what to tell him. This is a sports kid. He needs to be outdoors. All we do is sit around here. And it's killing him. I understand. It's frustrating. But the hospital where he's going to have the radiation, that's a different hospital than this. So he'll be leaving this hospital at least once every single day. So he can leave. For treatment. But it would mean the world to him if I could just take him to a game, just-- just one ball game, please. I'll set it up. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, let's work on that form a little bit over there. Hey, good job right there. Hey, guys, just get it serious. Stop screwing around. Here we go. Here we go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Come on Hey. I just got a text. All right, he's coming tomorrow. Bryce's dad says he's coming to the game. Let's go! Hey, listen. All right, guys, listen to me. I want to do something special for my friend here, all right? But I'm not going to do that unless we're all in. Are we all in? All in! Bring it in here for a break for Bryce. Let's go guys. Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce, Bryce. Let's go. Tonight, we ride. Let's go fellas. Bring it up. Bring it up. Dude, you shave your head. No, man. We all did. All in, All in! Coach, coach. Quick interview. Sure. Rolling? Rolling. Coach Doyle, tell us a little bit about what was happening here tonight? Bryce Newman, incredible athlete, was a linebacker and wide receiver for us. So devastating, yes, brain cancer. Yeah, it's really unfortunate situation. As you may recall, coach, my father passed from brain cancer. So I really understand the fight. I'm very sorry to hear that. Best of luck tonight. Thank you. Hey, Eric. See you next week, right? All right. See you later. You guys go home safely. Hey, guys. Hey, you Richard Newman? I am. Miles Himmel, a local news reporter. Just wondering if I could get Brycen on camera for a quick interview. Yeah, ask him. Yeah. Yeah? Awesome. Right here OK? Yeah. Great. Perfect. Let's do it. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Lord, we can do together. And we ask that you watch over Brycen. And we ask that you feel his body more. Everyone knows that Saint Joseph was a carpenter and the father of Jesus. What you may not know is that he was descended from royalty. His great, great grandfather was King David. That same royalty belongs to you, because each one of you boys is a child of King. God created you, and you are his child. Marilyn. Well. This is a real treat. Glad I could come. Hi. Oh, help yourself. I'm the one who brought it down here remember, all right? I appreciate it. Who is that? That's Richard Newman. Everybody in the hospital knows who he is. Unfortunately, he has a son here that's not doing too well. He's only 15. It's really sad. What's the kid got? Brain cancer. Oh, God. God bless him. I got to go. I got to deliver. Yeah, I bet you do. I can't believe I told you that. Did I say that out loud? Yes, you did. I love you. I'll see you around. I love you, too, hon. Thanks for lunch. Take care, buddy. Hey, Brycen. Can we come in? Yeah, sure. Where's your dad? He's getting lunch I think. What are you drawing? I like to draw cars. Very cool. Hey, Brycen. Saw you on the news at the game, really cool. Yeah, must've been nice to see a game. Have you had a chance to think about your wish? Yeah. Can I give away my wish? To who? My dad. That's a really thoughtful idea. And I'm very sure that he would rather you have something. Maybe it's something you guys can do together. How about a Ford Raptor? A what? It's a truck. I don't know. You told me to think big. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. Geez. If I had known you were here, I'd have brought you some food. I can go back. I don't mind. We're good. Thank you. Are you sure? OK. Thank you. So Brycen has given us his wish. Oh. And what pray tell would that be ? A Ford Raptor. OK. Yeah. OK, honestly, I can't promise you that we can get you a brand new car. But stay on that wave. We'll put the word out, see what we can do. Yeah, yeah. That's good. OK. Yeah, that's good. Thank you. It's very generous. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you soon, Brycen. It's great seeing you. Thanks you guys. All right. Bye-bye. A Ford Raptor, are you out of your mind? What? You said it was a good truck. I know. But Brycen, when I was your age, man, I had a $300 Chevelle. Yeah. And you walked to school in the snow, uphill, both ways. And it was a tundra. OK, wise guy, wise guy. Oh, hey, sorry guys. Hey, Brycen, can I borrow that sketch pad? Yeah, I guess. I promise you I'll bring it back. Thanks. See you guys. It was great seeing you. Bye. Let me tell you something. It was tough when I was growing up. We had one thimble of rice every two weeks. OK, dad. That's how we ate. You know how your grandfather was. Look what he's been drawing. That is a cool car. What kind of car do you think it is? Maybe a Corvette. I have no idea. That ladies is a Mustang, an old Mustang. Huh. We've been married a long time, right? And I know when you go huh, it doesn't mean huh like another person might say huh. It means huh, there's something I'm thinking that's going to change your life. So what is your huh today? Well, you said this was your cancer project because of the rust, was that right? Yeah, there's a lot of rust as you can see. Yeah. That's for sure. Well, do you remember that kid I was telling you about with brain cancer. You OK? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Brycen. Brycen, yeah. Well, the Make-A-Wish foundation was in his room today. They were? Yeah. What did you wish for? He wished for a car. Now, he gave them a drawing of I guess what was his dream car and whoa, who looked a lot like this. I'm just saying. Dear, Jesus. I love you. I trust you. I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always love you. I pray for my faith and salvation, be strong in your eyes. If I should die, then I'll be there in heaven with you. In your name, I pray. Amen. Mr. Newman, hi, my name is Neerav Jadeja.. I'm CEO here at General Valley Hospital. Hi. I have someone here to see you. Hey, oh, I'm Ed. I'm nurse Marilyn's husband. She may have told you I was coming by to see Brycen. May I come in? Yeah, please, please. Thank you. It's nice to meet you. I don't want to wake him up. Hey, Bryce. Buddy, hey, hey. I got someone here who wants to meet you. Hey, Brycen. I'm Ed Hanson you know your nurse, Marilyn, the pretty one, I'm her husband. Hey. You're not hitting on her, are you? Little bit. I have this car I want to give you. It's a '67 Mustang. And I want to fix it up. I want to make it perfect for you. A car for me? Where is it? It's at our house. Speak of the devil. Hey, Bryce. She is pretty. Hey, watch it. Keep your hands off. So I got this car at a junkyard. And it didn't make the boss happy. But I was tinkering with it, and she told me the other day about and your situation. And so we were kind of thinking that it might be a good project for us. Like I'll fix it, but I want your input. And it's going to take a while. But I figured that it gave us something to look forward to. Yeah. OK. But you had to do something for me. You got to get better, OK? OK. OK. I'll let you sleep. Ed, thank you so much. Take care yourself. Thank you. All right. Dad. Is that incredible or what? How cool was that? When I was your age, I had a $300 Chevelle. Dad. I got you. Love you, buddy. Love you. I think you're going to be very impressed. I had a lot of help, though. Yeah? Yeah. You're going to love it. It's cherry. It's so great. Yeah, anyone, you pick anyone you want. How about this one? How about-- how about something a little more-- something more like that. OK. It's good. You're cool with that. Hey, not bad, not bad at all. Brycen. Oh, hey guys. How are you. It's good to see you. We got something for you. We know the treatments have been a little much, and they're taking a toll on you. So we got something to hopefully make it a little easier. You got me an iPad? Yeah. This is so cool. Yeah, you can make drawings on that. Thank you so much. Good to see you. OK, you take care. Take care, Brycen. Alex. You OK? Yeah. Yeah. No practice today? No, I took the day off. There's nothing else they can do. The tumor, they've tried everything. So they're sending him to this experimental trial in Florida. I've never had anyone die in my life. When we can't, God can, right? Yeah, that's-- that sounds great. But no offense, why hasn't he? I don't know. But I do know this. God is still in control. He still sits on that throne. He is still in the miracle business. Alexander, how many times have you sat right here, and cheered, prayed for a miracle? That's what we need to do. Dad. Yeah, buddy? Would you be mad if I gave the tablet to Kimmi? Who's Kimmi? The kid in the ward. Well, I don't know if we have enough money to buy a new one. That's OK, dad. It's the right thing to do. She gets bored and she doesn't have one. OK. Dad. Yeah, bud? Am I going to die? What? He's not going to make it. That's what I heard the doctor say about Jason Lyons the other night. Am I not going to make it? Am I not going to make it, dad? Dad, am I going to die? No, no, no. Bryce, I don't want to hear you say that again. You understand me? Bryce, we're going to beat this together, me and you, OK? We're a team. We're a team. We're a team. Are we a team? We're a team. And we're going to beat this thing together. I love you. I love you too, dad I put my trust in God. Put your trust in God. I trust God. OK. Tell me more about this Kimmi person. I taught her how to spell her name with blocks. Hey. OK. Now, that's great. Thank you. Yeah, he'll be so happy to see all his friends again before he goes to Florida, so. Let's hope so. All right, thank you so much. Bye-bye. What are we doing? If I told you, it wouldn't be surprised. OK, you guys can all have a seat. So now that our guest of honor has arrived, we are gathered to support Brycen Newman, our fellow Don on his fight. So I've asked Father Martin to come and pray with us for Brycen. Thank you. So good to have each of you guys here today. Listen, the Kingdom of God has never meant to be a spectator sport. Brycen, you'd be the first to tell us. The only way you win a game is by actually getting on the field and fighting. And this is our field of faith, you guys. This is our moment to believe that what we read is actually real, that his word is more real than what we feel. You and I have a chance to put Gods word to the test. In fact, the book of James says that if someone sick like Brycen, we're to lay hands on them and God will heal them. That's either real or it's not, but I say we find out right now. In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. God, we just thank you for what it is you accomplished on the cross. We thank you God, that when you said it is finished, you were talking about sin, death, hell and every... In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. It is done. OK, buddy. Transport should be here any minute to take you to the airport. But you're getting your own plane. Dad. Yeah? Are you mad at God? What-- no. Yes. Yes, I am. Do you think he has a plan? Jeez, Bryce, I don't know. I like to think that he does. I hope that he does. But I'm just not so sure. Where are these guys? Father, thank you for my dad. Thank you for his love. Thank you for allowing me to have this wonderful man in my life. God, please, calm his heart, let him know that you are with him. I pray this in your name. Amen. All right, now, we got all your bags ready. I just want to-- Oh, hey. Are those the scans you want us to take with us? No, they're not here. Who's not here, transport? No, look, we are going to be late for the plane. No, I canceled them. What? The tumor's gone. What do you mean? We double, triple, quadruple checked and tested everything. Brycen's tumor, it's gone. Are you sure? 100%. Not only that, the area around it has healed. Son, yesterday, you had a probable death sentence. Today, God is giving you another chance at life. Congratulations. Well, wait, what about-- what about Florida. No need to go to Florida. Plenty of beaches right here in California. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I knew it. No, it's great. OK. Thanks for calling. Lucy can you move your head to the left a little bit? You guys move a little bit closer. You guys look pretty good. All right, on the count of three, ready, one, two, three. How much time? Wait, guys, guys, guys, guys, hold up, hold up. What is it? Some of these on the phone for you Bryce. And they said they're pulling up the hill. What? Oh. Oh, what? Oh, it is. Dad, what-- no. No. Dude. What is this? This is for you, buddy. For me? Oh, my goodness. This is the car? This is your car. This is our car. My God. I love you. I love you, too. What do you think, buddy? I think it's amazing. I think get in. Get in there. Get in there. Yes, of course. hold on. Be careful. You got it, sir. Hey, I love you, kid. Hey, you hear me? I love you, too, dad. All right, buddy. Have fun. Have fun. All right. What's up, boys? Let's go. Let's go. It took some time. But I found the story. You see, the Miracle of Manchester wasn't just about Brycen Newman being healed. It was so much more than that. It was about reminding us that miracles are real and how when we love, and give, and believe, we all become part of making miracles real again. It's about putting on a show for him by giving our best and showing that we're going to fight while he fights. And just that he could be out here shows us like he's out here in the hot sun with cancer. And we ought to keep fighting and get better. We can't quit out there. It's going to mean a lot when we got to get that victory for him. This young man is the most courageous kid I know. He's definitely an inspiration for us to go through whatever struggles we're going through, whether that be on the field or off the field. Make an explosion. And all those things I didn't say, wrecking balls inside my brain. I will scream them loud tonight. Can you hear my voice this time? This is my fight song, take back my life song. Bryson, right here, give us your Dons. Dons on three. Dons on three. One, two, Dons! My power's turned on starting right now, I'll be strong. That you can beat it. That you can beat it. There you go, buddy. Fight, fight, right? Yeah. You can beat it. Fight. Yeah. I love that. I love you, too. I'm so sorry having you go through this. At one point, the tumor was gone. But it returned. Everybody's worried about me. In too deep. His friends were asked to report to the school's bleachers in red shirts to show their support. There's about 1,600 kids. And they all put their hands over me like that over my head. And I was afraid. Things I didn't say. Praise your name ask this in Christ our Lord, Amen. He believes that, that day he was saved. I said I'm done. I said I'm good. So I am good. Three weeks later, we went back to the hospital. They did another MRI. And the enhancement they call it had shrunk. They'd never seen-- the doctors couldn't explain it. They just say it's a miracle. And we kind of know what it was. My fight song. And I don't really care if nobody else believes because I still got a lot of fight left in me. A lot of fight left in me. Like a small-- If you walk down, I mean the oncology floor at the hospital and you see all these children fighting and going through pain and they just want to be cancer free. And so we're selling these t-shirts to help the researchers find a cure for cancer. So those kids be cancer free. I might only have one match, but I can make an explosion. This is my fight song, take back my life song, prove I'm all right song. My power's turned on. Starting right now, I'll be strong. I'll play my fight song. And I don't really care if nobody else believes because I still-- I'm going to put it in here. I'm going to glue it back on my head. Who's got the Elmer's glue? No I've, still got a lot of fight left in me. Like a small boat on the ocean, sending big waves into motion. Like how a single word can make a heart open, I might only have one match, but I can make an explosion. And all those things I didn't say wrecking balls inside my brain, I will scream them loud tonight. Can you hear my voice this time?
