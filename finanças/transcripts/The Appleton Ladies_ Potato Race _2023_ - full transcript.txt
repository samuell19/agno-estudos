In you get. Mabel. Car. [whines] Mabel. Come on, mate. Get in the car. Mabel. Car! Car! Come on, mate. [sighs] -Come on, don't be a dickhead. -[Mabel whines softly] [sighs] Hey. I know that it's a bit scary. It is for me too. But we're going home. Hey? We're going home. [grunts] [Mabel whines] In you pop. There you go. Good girl. Good job. -Okay. -[engine starts] [fuel warning dings] [groaning] Oh no...

Hey? * Got all these grand ideas * * Everything I have is Too heavy to hold * * I'm trying to let go [song ends] [magpies singing] [patient coughs] Who coughed? [silence] Wait outside if you're going to cough. Mrs Bunyan. Hello. Surgery opens at nine, Dr Anderson. -I'm so sorry. -Well, you've got a busy morning. -Let's get moving. -Thank you. No animals in the surgery. Oh, Mabel's a therapy dog. She'll sit right here in the corner. No, she will not. Bloody hell. This is a doctor's surgery, not a five-star rehab in the Byron Bay Hinterlands. -Therapy dog. -Dr H said that she'd be fine. Dr Holliday is on holiday and I run the show here. She can come in with me then. Sit down, Billy Pope. Wait your turn like everyone else. Thank you, Mr Pope. It's great to have you back again, Dr Anderson. Oh, cut it out. I'm Penny. I'm so sorry that I'm late, everyone. Hopefully, you won't be waiting too long. -[Billy laughs] -Come on, Mabel. Come on. Oh. [door closes] Mabel. [laughs] Good name. See this mole on my arm? It's been there about three years. Yeah, that's nothing to worry about, but we'll book you in for a full-body skin check in town. -Could it be cancer? -Oh, probably not. But it's worth checking after a lifetime of Appleton sun. But there is a chance it could be cancer? It's best to rule everything out. -Okay. -[laughs softly] I don't want to take up more of your time, Penny, but there is one other thing. Well, Miss Vaughn, I am here for all the things. Apparently, it's going to be a big year for baked goods at the show. Are you going in the scone competition this year with your nanna's recipe? And go against these? No way. Very wise. [magpies singing] [jogging footsteps, panting] [timer beeps] What was it? Put your potatoes down, love. Have a stretch. -We'll do plain sprints, no weights. -[Nikki groans] Aunty Barb, that's the last thing I need to be doing. Get a drink. Then sprints. I'm not going to win with these times. Kazzy Pearce will be able to beat me even if she's still preggers. Stop that. You're the greatest female potato racer the town's ever seen. -You'll get there. -[exhales, panting] Come on. [panting] We can fit you in around three, Gavin. I've got a job at three, Mum. Well, I don't know what to tell you, son. -Hi, Gavin. -Where's Doctor H? Ah, he's on long service leave, so I'm here taking his place for the next few months. Nah. [door opens, closes] Ah, Kazzy Pearce. So, I'm due in two weeks, right? The potato race is in four. Your sister's not beating me again, got it? Got it. But there's some risks racing so close to having a baby. Yeah, why don't you take that over there and put her over by the books? -Do you know about prolapse? -Yeah. Of course I know about prolapse. That's what I'm here for. Okay, good. So, what undies do you recommend? Undies? To hold everything in me clunge. Like, surely there's some prescription undies? Ah, yeah. They're called prolapse support garments. -But they're pretty expensive. -I can't pay through Medicare? I've got a health care card. Um... Here, take a look. Three hundred bucks! Fuck me dead! [exhales, laughs] So, what's the computer situation here? There is no computer situation here. You and Dr H do everything by hand? Always have. What if the hospital needs something quickly? [Penny scoffs] Seriously? A fax machine? We have a system. It's worked perfectly well for 30 years. Dr H mentioned I'll probably be here longer than his holiday, didn't he? He did. So, I'm going to need a computer, okay? Righto. Do what you like. Heard there's a new doctor in town and she's a massive cockwomble! [both laugh] Heard the local hairdresser still uses streak caps and is a massive slut bag. Streak caps? Foils forever. Dr Anderson, if you won't be needing me -for anything else...? -No. Are you making Joan call you "Dr Anderson"? Of course not. Mrs Bunyan, you can't be calling me Dr Anderson. It's weird. I'll be calling you Dr Anderson while we're here. -So long. Bye-bye. -Bye. [door opens, closes] Still a bundle of fun, your mother-in-law. [laughing] She's all right. Did you know they don't use computers here? Not one. I don't use a computer either. You're a hairdresser. -Hey, put that back. -I need it. -Ah, you don't need a speculum. -I do. You can administer your own pap smear? Yeah, maybe. I love a pap smear. -You're mental. -You are. So, speaking of, are you going to try again? Ah, I have about half an egg left. I've told you, you can have some of mine. It's not meant to be. I'm looking forward to Elliott's party. Are you organised? No. Thank God for Aunty Barb. Thank God for Aunty Barb. I'm going to book you in for a treatment next week. -You're a mess. -[laughing] [indistinct chatter, laughter] I'm telling you, she'll get bored. Joan! She'll be here any minute. -I don't care if she hears me. -Well, I do. I want her to feel welcome. She's had a rough couple of years. Go easy, hey? [Barb] So disappointing that man got her promotion. [Nikki] Yeah, it was so unfair. Oh, I can't believe she'll be here. And just in time for the Appleton Show. Maybe she can help with show business. We're all right with show business. [violent hissing] Ethan? You decided what show bag you're getting this year? [Ethan] Aunty Barb, I'm 19. I have an apprenticeship and I make me own craft beer. Never too old for a show bag, but. Have you told Elliot about the music? No, I didn't. I thought we could tell him tonight together on his birthday. What, Nanna? Well, we'll have to run it in front of the committee... We are the committee. The Cold Chisel tribute band... Bold Sizzle. They like to use a local support act, so we gave them your demo... -And they loved it! -Of course they loved it. Seriously? What do you say to your nanna and your Aunty Barb? I'm bloody stoked. Thank you so much. [Barb] Happy birthday, darling. Your first paid gig, and on Appleton Race Day. -It's paid? -You bet it is. 250 dollars. -What? -[Barb laughs] [gentle music playing] [currawongs calling] [distant chatter, laughter] [Barb] Oh, look. -Here's the food. -One of the best ones. Whoo! Why are they all broken? [indistinct chatter] [Eddie chatters indistinctly] It's true. The doctor's back in town. Hey, Mark. [gasps happily] [making excited noises] How's my beautiful boy? Ah! [grunts] Your beautiful boy needs his nappy changed. [lighter clicking] Mmm. -How long are you here for? -Don't know yet. [Mark exhales] How are you going? Don't know yet. Righto. So everyone's out the back? Come on. Let's go get you changed. Phooey! Phooey! Yuck! -To the... -Did you want...? -No! -You don't want it. [Joan] Pass it, Bob. Here's our girl. The woman of the moment. -This is for you. -Aunty Pen. Really? -[Bob] Here at last. -It's Elliot's birthday, Aunty Barb. He is the man of the moment. But our girl, she's back! Only for a few weeks. Happy birthday, sweetheart. [Elliot laughing] Oh my God! Thank you so much, Aunty Pen. It's a telecaster. This is huge! [Barb] Goodness me, so shiny! [Penny] Can't wait to hear you play it. You won't have to wait long. This darling, Penny, has a gig at the Appleton Show. -Wow! -Come on, Aunty Barb. Love, how are you settling in? I can't believe you're staying in an Airbnb when Barb and I have still got your room. -Didn't want to impose. -Family don't impose. Family can definitely impose. [Barb laughs] Okay, why are we not eating Aunty Barb's potato salad? Let's get going. [shouts] Mark! Dinner! -Where is Mark? -[Penny] You're so welcome. [Elliot] Gosh, this is the best. This is my dream guitar. [Penny] Well, he told me that it might be your dream guitar. Look at this. [soft guitar strumming] [appreciative noises, clapping] -[Nikki] So nice. -[Ethan] Sounding good. -[Elliot] Thanks, Aunty Pen. -[Penny laughs] Oh well, I might get going 'cause we've got another busy day tomorrow, hey, Mrs Bunyan? Take some cake for your morning tea. I will. I wish you could stay forever. I really do. What's so great about the city? It stinks. The traffic, you don't know your neighbours... I'd like not to know my neighbours. There's people on drugs. There's people on drugs at this very table, Aunty Barb. And what about living five minutes from an actual Westfield shopping centre? And the musicals. Appleton Theatrical Society did a fabulous production of Grease last year. -Fabulous. -Mmm. [Barb] They did. Well, on that, I've been thinking about this for a while, and... I think I might want to move home. Like, Dr H's holiday might be a trial. -Really? -Oh! -Sweet. -Awesome. [laughing] [Barb] Really? Yeah, I sold my place in Sydney. -[gasps] What? -[Elliot] Oh my God. -You sold your place in Sydney? -Yeah. That's a big move, Pen. Yeah. I mean, I always thought that I would come home eventually. Did you know about this? I can help you with the boys. And how is being a country GP going to be enough for you? I can tell you, it's different every day. You couldn't get out of this town fast enough when you finished school. Why are you being so weird about this? -I'm not being weird. -You're being weird. You are. What? Don't take all the cake. Yeah, I'll take as much as I want to. -Girls!-It's not your cake. It's Elliot's. -Well, I bloody made it. -[Barb] Oh! [Penny] Ah ha! -You did not. Aunty Barb? Huh? -[laughs] Well, I did I did all the piano keys. [Barb laughing] [Penny] Did you stick these liquorice logs on, did you? [Barb gasps] [shocked gasps] [Penny exhales] [Penny] Oh... Ooh... [gasps, laughter] [upbeat guitar music playing] [Barb, Ethan, Bob continue laughing] See? It's going to be so fun having me back. [Barb keeps laughing] [Penny] Good night. -Bye, darling. -Bye. [gentle guitar music playing] G'day! Billy Hindmarsh with you from Appleton FM, and it's three weeks now until the Appleton Potato Race. It's been timed pretty perfectly with the harvest, and right about now, those potatoes are coming out of the ground, and they're getting put in those sacks to be carried by our fine potato athletes. So, good luck, fellas. And the ladies. [coffee maker whirring] [sighs] You look like you might be a cappuccino drinker, Mrs Bunyan. No, thanks. Moccona will do me fine. I thought it might be nice for us to have an espresso machine here because we both go through a lot of coffee and they're very easy to make. Ha! I don't need another job. Thank you. Okay. I'm headed to Nikki's for lunch. You've got a patient in 20 minutes. Okay. [upbeat music playing] Penny Anderson, I'll be coming to see you next week about this finger. Come and see me this arvo, Sharon. We can fit you in. [Sharon] Thanks, love. [softly] Be careful of that finger if I was you, Shaz. I hear she's back here 'cause she sliced into someone's brain and made them an idiot. [Sharon] Cut the crap, Denise. Sure no one's sliced into your brain? Made you an idiot? [Nikki] Look, Aunty Barb, obviously, you and I would have to be on Survivor. Both athletes. We've got grunt. -A lot of grunt! -Grunt. Nikki's a genius. -She won't do you wrong. -[door opens] Can I book you in for 4:00 p.m.? [Nikki] Whereas, um, Penny, it's a different story. -[Penny] What did I miss? -Okay, bye. So, if you had to be on a reality TV show, what would it be? -Oh, I wouldn't be on any. -[Nikki] Oh, that's not the game! Why do you never play this game properly? You have to be on one. You could be on the Bake Off. You make wonderful scones. Oh, what about one of the dating ones? Come on. Would you go on one of those dating ones? -I don't need to. -I don't want to. And I can't do anything that would be remotely interesting for anyone watching reality TV. Oh, but you're so good at being a mole. You are heaps better at being a mole. Okay, being a mole is a talent I have. I will admit that. That's why I'd be great on any of them. Speaking of being a mole, how do I get you-know-who to agree to some computer training? -Penny! -Sorry, Aunty Barb, she is... Joan's stressed at the moment. Try her after the show. You training for the potato race, Penny? Oh, no way. [laughs] I'll just wait until the Monday after for all the back, hip, and ego injuries to come flooding into the surgery. Has Nikki roped you into it? Well, you're not a true local until you've run in the potato race. -That's what Nikki says. -Rubbish! I am a proud sixth-generation potato racer. Penny is the only one in this family that doesn't get the potato race. It is not that I don't get it. I just have no interest in putting a sack of potatoes across my shoulder and running around an oval. Here, can you put these in the surgery? Why hasn't Mrs Bunyan put them up? Because she doesn't mix show business with her medical work. -[Barb laughs] -Please. I hate to be this arsehole, but you've got a typo. [Barb groans] Of course you found a typo. It's printed now. I don't want to see it. Don't show me. -It's pretty significant. -[groans] Show me. Like, how did none of you pick that up? [Nikki] What? $200. There's a zero missing. Ugh, as if. Well then, there's one too many on the blokes'. Nah. The blokes' prize money is $2,000 and yours is 200? 200 bucks is all I need. Buys me a train into the city and a ticket to a musical. -Sorry, if I win, that is. -[laughs] If Rania wins, she will be...? Oh, I'm taking my daughter, Miriam, to Sydney to climb the Harbour Bridge. Two-hundred bucks won't get you up the first pylon. [Raina] Okay. I'll tell her. Your patient's waiting. Oh, um... Nikki, that's crazy. Like, this is... this is crazy, and I can't believe that you would think that it isn't. We'll be talking more about this after work. -[door opens] -No, we won't. [door closes] You were very quiet through all of that, Aunty Barb. I've tried a few times to get some more from the kitty for the ladies' race, but... never had any luck. I can't believe I didn't notice it before. Righto. These are done. What is it? Why is the prize money for the potato race $2,000 for the blokes and 200 for the women? Blokes' race is a much bigger deal. Right. Why? More history. They carry more weight. Men's race gets more sponsors. But isn't that unfair? -How?-Isn't sport supposed to be equal? [Joan scoffs] It's not. Yeah, but it should be. Take it up with the committee. Aren't you the committee? Billy Pope, Dr Anderson will see you now. -G'day doc. -Hi, come on through. Mr Pope, you're on the committee. Did you know about the prize money for the potato race? Back in my day, you raced for the honour. Do you think your grandad ran for the prize money? Come on. He was the greatest champion the race ever saw. I don't think he ever took home a dollar for it. You know Nikki beat his record two years ago? [scoffs] So it doesn't bother you that the ladies' race doesn't have the same prize money as the men? Love, it would bother me if it did. Um, we need to get your blood pressure up. So, it might be your Parkinson's medication. Let's try taking just one Mirapex at night before bed. Righto. Are you in a rush? I just can't afford a double appointment. Look, no disrespect, but can't be talking potato racing while the clock's ticking. -We bulk bill, Mr Pope. -Not for double appointments. Well, today we do. Ladies' race just isn't the same. Sorry love. [door opens, shuts] [gentle guitar music playing] [neighing] [music continues] -Yes, that's good. -Thanks, Maria. Hey, Gavin. Who are you training for the potato race this year? None of your business. Are you training any women? Why do you even care? I want to know the difference in, you know, skill. And I thought you would be the one to know about that. Don't even know why they want to race. They're not built for it. They can't carry the same weight. They can't run as fast. They... they cry if they trip over. Gavin! That's completely bull S and you know it. The ladies' race has its own brand of special. May not be as fast or as heavy, but it's just as glorious. Which is why the prize money should be equal. Chicks want everything that's ours these days. That's what's bull S. Love it when Gavin pops in. He's like a sunny day after a week of flooding. [chuckles] -Okay. Thanks. -Cheers. How much longer are you working? Well, until I pop, mate. Yeah, you're about to pop. Can't you rest? Yeah, it's funny, the money tree out the back of me house has stopped bloody growing. Can you believe it? Speaking of money, what is with the blokes getting paid two grand for the potato race, -and the women get... -Yeah, and we get 200. Yeah. What are you having? Oh, ah, um, sausage roll and tomato sauce, and... a vanilla slice, please. Yeah, I'd be stoked with 200 bucks. It was no hundred bucks a few years ago. Someone has to do something about it. Yeah? How? Six bucks 80. [pensive music playing] [Joan exhales] [magpies singing] Hello, Aunty Barb. -Hello, Mrs Bunyan. -Hello, darling. How nice to see you here. I've come to talk about the prize money for the potato race. It's not on the agenda. Can you add it to the agenda? It's 4:59. Um, I didn't realise I... Can't it be part of general business, Joan? It's 5:00 p.m. I call this meeting of the Appleton Show Committee to order. [Barb] Present are Joan Bunyan, president. Barb Brickner, secretary. Yep. Apology from Billy Pope, committee member in charge of entertainment. -Flu? -Yep. Apology from Billy Pearce, food and beverage. Hope the flu doesn't get all the Billys. Apology from Billy Morton, committee member in charge of the potato races. Don't know what's happened to him. The bastard didn't even bother texting. [men laughing] -Catch you later. -[all] G'day. Yeah. To middies and schnitties. To schnitties and middies. Yeah. [chuckling] Mm! -[woman] See ya. -[all] See ya. [Joan] Item number 17, food and beverage. [Barb] The refugee's action group wants to put up a stall. Some of the refugees want to share their food. Bloody hell, Barb. This is the Appleton Show, not the multicultural festival. Don't put that down. I've never tried Syrian food, Joan, and they want to do it for a gold coin donation. Isn't that lovely? [Joan] Rania wants to put the locals out of business by offering up free food? Rania wants to be part of the community. Meet people, make some friends. If you've got the choice between a jacket potato for 15 bucks from Tracey, and a goat curry for a dollar, what are you choosing? It's show day, Joan. I'm eating it all. Righto. Back entrance of the pavilion. -Can I ask about the plan for... -Not general business yet. [Joan] Item number 33. The potato race. [Barb] 30th year of the ladies' race. The debacle of '91, we had no choice. Personally, I'm quite proud of the debacle of '91, Joan. I'm proud the show survived it. [Barb] All those in favour of Cheryl Abbott's potato sack fashion competition "Hessians on the Field" say aye. [Joan] Aye. General business. Any member of the public wants to raise a concern with the committee? [exhales] [Barb coughs pointedly] [mouths silently] Oh, me! I want to raise a concern. Penny Anderson, member of the public, wants to raise a concern. Noted. Penny Anderson, what is your concern? -The prize money for the potato race. -What about it? The men get $2,000, and the women get 200. And? [scoffs] It's unfair. -Says who? -Says everyone. Have any of the ladies running in the race mentioned this to you? No. Your sister, the current Appleton Ladies' Potato Race champion? No. But there is equal prize money pretty much everywhere now. Not in rugby league, not in cricket, not in AFL. And why? Because they're not up to the men's standard. Once they get the crowds and the skills, maybe they'll deserve it. I would like to propose that the show society does the right thing and makes the prize money equal. How? Got any ideas how we're going to get the extra 2,000 three weeks out from show day? Surely you have a reserve. We do not have a reserve. -Sponsors?-Sponsors are locked in and paid. Fancy asking them for more money, Barb? No, I do not. Sorry, Penny. Sponsorship's hard enough to get as it is. I just think the prize money should be equal and we should do something about it. Righto. Any other general business? This meeting of the Appleton Show Committee has ended at 6:59 p.m. [papers rustling] -[kookaburras laughing] -[birds calling] [Nikki] Here, can you pass it to me, Aunty Barb? [Barb] Ready? And... ready, set, go! [Nikki panting] Look at her, Mabel-cakes. She's a potato-racing goddess. You know what? Mrs Bunyan can get stuffed. This is bigger than her. Hey? It's bigger than her. What was it, Aunty Barb? 1:57. Ugh, that's garbage! Darling, you're two weeks away from your fortieth birthday. Your times are going to get slower. Let's do some weight training. I've been doing weight training. I've been doing everything you told me. [Nikki panting] I just want to win one last time. [panting] I don't want it to end yet. Okay, well, let's go again. ["Now or Never" playing] * There's no easy way to * Way to say goodbye * * There's no regrets * I've followed your footsteps * * But I got to find my own path * * Ooh, ooh, I'll be * Ooh, ooh, I'll be brave... * Hey, do you like this? "Appleton Ladies' Potato Race Prize Equality. Let's mash the potato ceiling." What do you think? Yeah? -Shall we? [laughs] -[Mabel barks] Not bad. [smooching] * It's time for me * Now or never * * It's time for me * Now or never * -Hi. -G'day. * You always told me * How far I could go... Yeah, go on. Yeah? Pop it. Thanks, Kazzy. -[song continues] -[birds singing] * Ooh, ooh, I'll be * * Ooh, ooh, I'll be brave... * Oh, Doctor. You've got the results of my test? -Miss Vaughn, everything's fine. -Oh. I'm actually here to ask if you would like to donate to the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race prize equality fund? I'm not one of those feminists. -Do you think women should vote? -Yes. And do you think that people should pay the same amount of money for your scones as they would for Billy Pearce's scones? They should pay more. Mine are much better. Congratulations, Miss Vaughn. You are a feminist. [laughing] Oh, goodness me. At my age? So, I'm taking donations of anything from ten cents upwards. Yes, all right. Just a minute. How's $20? That would be wonderful, thank you. * Through the open field * * And I look to the sky * And follow the voice That carries me * * 'Cause it's time * For me... Hello there. Would you like to donate to the Appleton Ladies'... -[man] No. -...Potato Race. Hello there. Would you like to donate to the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race? * It's time for me * Now or never [man] Piss off. Okay then, thank you. * It's time for me * Now or never * [men laugh] You heard how Pen's going with the fundraising? Ugh, it's just, it's so Penny. To just come in and try and change something without asking anyone. I mean, without asking me. Not even, what, two weeks after she gets here? You don't want more money? I just want it to be like it is. I don't understand why she needs to make a big shit show. I feel so embarrassed. -We never... -See? There you go. She's making you feel embarrassed. I should be. How did I not change this before? Aunty Barb, there would be no ladies' race without you. $200 prize money? We should be doing better than that. We don't run the race for the money, Aunty Barb. We run it to feel the thrill of the crowd in the grandstands. The pressure of the potatoes on our backs. The burn as you round the third corner, dust flying up in your mouths. The mud making you feel like you're running through cement. The pump of the sack on the ground at the end as winner. See? It's not about the money. [birds calling] [indistinct pub chatter] -[guitar music playing] -[indistinct chatter] Hey, darling. [tin rattles] -Anyone put any notes in? -Not that I saw. Nikki. Can't you help me? -An endorsement from the champion? -No! -You're being so dumb. -You just put in the money yourself. You make about 500 an hour. I wish. You could fund both races with that coat, Pen. I have thought about this. It needs to come from the community or it means nothing. And before you ask, no, we can't split the men's prize money. [scoffs] I won't be asking you that. Can you imagine? [Penny] We can't take anything away from the men, but we need to make it equal. But it's not equal. -How are you, Gavin? -It's not equal. -Well, you may think that, but... -I know that. -How many races have you run? -Hardly the point. 'Cause I've raced eight and I've coached 12, and I'm telling ya, it's not equal. Have you actually ever put a 50-kilo sack of potatoes on your back? -No. -[Gavin] No. This race is a tribute to the men-- and it's men, believe me-- that carted them sacks from the fields and the sheds to the trucks and the shops. I am fully aware of this town's history. -My whole family... -[Gavin] Right. So you know then that it's not equal, so why are you wasting all our time with your lezzo bullshit? Come on. Gavin? [Gavin] Oh, piss off, Bob. It's because of limp-dick fucks like you that women in this town don't know their place. -[Barb] Gavin! -It's not equal! So take all your leftie bullshit back to Sydney where it belongs with all them other fuckwits and homos. That's enough. I mean it, Gavin. That language? It's appalling language. You should start thinking about walking home. -I'm not going anywhere. -Come on, Gavin. No one wants the cops up here tonight. Just go! [indistinct chatter resumes] -I'm so sorry, Uncle Bob. -You've got nothing to be sorry for. What he said, that was... It's nothing I haven't heard before, love. He's so angry that boy. So angry. This kind of shit, Pen. See? It brings out the ugly. [gentle guitar music playing] [birds calling] [Penny] Aren't you meant to be on a beach in Noosa? It is she! The student has returned from her time in the world to her teacher. Oh, but she's so sophisticated. Gone is the teenage acne and the ill-considered glasses. He sees her transformed into a woman of substance and style. But, um... she's developed a penchant for trouble-making. You've been talking to Mrs Bunyan. You've made my life very hard with your manilla folders. My dear, it's a battle your teacher wasn't equipped to have. I don't like computers much either. [laughs softly] So when are you coming back? I'm quite enjoying my freedom from lancing the boils off Appletonian bums. How are you finding it? -I like the work. -Mmm. -[grunts softly] -Can I help ya? Yep. [grunts softly] If you pull it from here, gently, you won't have to put so much arm into it. -How's Nugget? -At the vet. -Is he okay? -Of course. He's such a charming horse, the vet just likes having him around. You know everyone thinks you're mad, riding Nugget to the shops. The word you're actually looking for is "eccentric." Well, Aunty Barb tells me where he chooses to relieve himself is the talk of the town. I don't know your Aunty Barb as well as I should. She, um... she never gets sick. -She's the best. -Of course. She raised you. [Penny laughs] When I came to town, I think the only person who made me feel welcome was Lucy Vaughn. She brought in a butter cake on my first day. She brought me scones. [chuckles] Dr Penny Anderson, change is hard for all of us, especially in a country town. You're a local treasure now. So how did you do it? I stayed. Stay. And won't be long before there's a soccer field named after you. Or... maybe the potato race track at the showground. For the potato uprising. Please don't retire. Can't we run the surgery together? There's no way I'm hanging around while Joan learns how to use booking software. [Penny laughs] [currawong calling] [phone ringing] Yo, Nickhead. [Nikki] Pen, Eddie's eaten some of Mark's weed. -Oh shit. -Shit? N-no not necessarily shit, sorry. W-- how much? How is he? [Nikki] I think he's a bit groggy. Okay, I'll be, um, I'm on my way. [tense music playing] I shouldn't have left him with Mark. Of course you should. He's his father. He's a real mess at the moment. Can't find any work since he got laid off, and he just... he just doesn't know what to do with himself. Except smoke cones. That's one thing. How are you paying the rent? I was doing more shifts at the pub. As well as running a salon and looking after the kids. [door opens] Hello. Oh, he's looking good. All right. I don't want you worrying about money. I'm always worrying about money. -I can help you with it. -No! -It's nothing to me. -I said no. When can we take him home? Soon.

[laughs softly] It's an Airbnb, Elliot. Someone does it for the owner. I'm the someone, Aunty Pen. You're old enough for coffee, aren't you? -Old enough to, ah, take it black. -[Penny laughs] How's school? It's okay. I've been asking how's school and you've been saying "it's okay" for 12 years. How are we going to communicate when I finish that final exam? What are you going to do when you finish? [sighs] Mum and Dad think it's stupid. That I'll never earn a living. Oh, well, they just want you to be safe. Aunties, on the other hand, want you to enjoy things. [Elliot laughs] I'd like to write music for movies and TV and stuff. So how do you do that? Well, there's a composition course in Sydney, but even getting the audition is... Okay, well, you get yourself the audition and I'll help you with the rest. -Really? -Yeah. Well, is there anything else you need done around the house? [laughs] Can I see your rate sheet? Mum says that helping each other is part of what it is to be in a family. Mmm, wish she felt that way about the potato race. You need to up your game with that. I don't know how I can do anything more. [upbeat music playing] [girl] Yeah, something simple. Like, just write that down to do. -Aunty Pen, meet Miriam. -[Miriam] Hi. Hi. You're Rania's daughter, aren't you? We need to set up a GoFundMe page. Right. I'm going to need you to get me the following. Photos of you. Photos of the potato race. Maybe of your mum. Old photos of Appleton. -There's a bunch of those inside. -Great. Get your phone, take photos of the photos, and Airdrop them to me. -Okay.-I'll dig through the family Facebook -and find some of Mum racing. -Let's get to work. Hi, I'm Elliot. I just turned 18, and I live in Appleton. We had our town's biggest moment before I was born when we were the 1992 Tidy Town. This is my mum. She's the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race champion. This is my Aunty Penny. She's the local doc, and she wants to change the prize money so it's equal. And we're live. Can I see? -I just sent you a link. -Oh. -Should be... -[Elliot] Yeah, you sent it. Okay. Great. [video] Hi, I'm Elliot. I just turned 18 and I live in Appleton... That is very cute. ...biggest moment before I was born when we were the 1992 Tidy Town... -[Miriam] We tried. -[Elliot] Facebook as well. This is my mum. She's the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race champion. Look at her. Isn't she awesome? Here's the thing. The men's race gets $2,000 and the women's race only gets 200. What? Let's do it. Let's raise the money. Oh, look, we've got someone already. -That's awesome. -Oh my gosh. -Aw, 20 bucks. -I've got someone here too. -Oh. -Oh, look, we got another one. -Oh my gosh. It's happening. -Yeah. [upbeat music playing] Mum! Mum! Yeah? I'm busy. Where's your potato sack? -It's in the boot. Why? -Can you get it for me? What? Why? [grunts] What are you doing? Training. [upbeat music continues] [cows mooing] [TV playing indistinctly] [Joan] Mark? You having your dinner in your room? [Mark] Nah, Mum. I'm coming out. Righto. [TV continues playing indistinctly] Hey. Watch it. Geez. [TV continues indistinctly] Ah, thanks, Mum. This looks great. [mockingly] "Thanks, Mum. This looks great." -Beer? -Thanks, Mum. "Thanks, Mum." Hey, I think it's a bloody shame what Penny's trying to do to you and this race, Mum. Don't you think, Mark? Shut up. Good chops. Love your chops, Mum. [mockingly] "Good chops. Love your chops, Mum." [grunts] [TV continues indistinctly] [owl hoots] [phone ringing] Hello? [man over phone] Is that Dr Anderson? Who's this? It's Luke Pearce. She's about to have the baby. She can't move. Can you come here? Oh, right. Yeah, no, I'll be, um, ten minutes. I'll be five minutes. Five, if I can. Yep. Okay. [dog barking] [Kazzy groaning] [Kazzy groans loudly] [Kazzy groans, panting] [groans] -Let's get you to the hospital. -There's no time. Get a look under there. [groans] -Kazzy, can you move to the bed? -[Luke] Mummy's all right. I can't move a muscle out of this position. Okay, Luke. You have to help. -Help me get Kazzy to the bed. -Yeah. -[Kazzy groans] -Come on, babes. -[Luke] You can do it. -[Kazzy groans] -Just up here. Almost there. -[Kazzy whimpers] [panting] -I'm right here, babes. -[panting] -[Luke] I'll be just over here. -[Kazzy] Up, up, up, up. [Luke] You can do this. We're here for you. All right, I reckon you got one or two more pushes. Geez, you reckon? When the next surge comes, I want you to give it everything, okay? [Kazzy whimpering] I... forgot... how... much... this... [screaming] ...hurts. [panting] -Well done. You did it, Kazzy. -[baby cries] You've got a beautiful healthy baby. [Kazzy groans, panting] -[Penny] Good job. -[baby crying] It's a girl. [Kazzy] Hi. [softly] Hello, little one. [indistinct] [panting] [laughs softly] What's... What's Penny short for? Penelope. Nah, that's rank. Let's call her Jasmine? We can call her Jazzy, 'cause it rhymes with Kazzy. -It's cute, hey? -That is so cute, babes. [Penny laughs softly] Oi, don't forget to pack me support pants, Penelope. We've got a race in two weeks. Absolutely. Come on, girls. Stop being a pair of soft cocks and come and meet your baby sister. [softly] Here. Come on. Look. Yeah? Come on. Say hello to your sisters. [baby gurgles] Say hello to your little family. [gentle piano music playing] [radio show host] Just ten days until the show now. The potato racers are going to be stepping up their training to make sure they've still got it, and, of course, the question on everybody's lips is who will win this year's championship. -It's that time of year again... -[Eddie cooing] Elliot, I need to go. [Elliot] Coming. [radio continues indistinctly] What's up, Eddie? Mum, can I come to training? I need to go right now. Great, I'll put these in the cupb... [groans] Sorry. Fucks sake! Sorry. [radio continues indistinctly] [indistinct chatter, roadway noise] [music playing indistinctly over store radio] Hey. Oh, hey, Sharon. How's your broken finger? I was expecting to see you last week. Yeah, well, you won't be seeing me again any time soon. Why? Don't need your politics shoved in me face. You know, doctors shouldn't be political. Like school teachers and the ABC. Thanks, Sharon. See you next time. I hear someone wonderful brought a baby into the world in a tiny caravan last night. Uncle Bob, I've made a big mistake. No one wants this, and I've just... [sobbing] I've upset everyone. Maria, can you take over here, please? [Maria] Sure, Bob. Come on, darling. [Penny sniffling] Love, since you've been doing this, I've been doing a bit of research with your Aunty Barb about pay in women's sport. You all get the rough end of the pineapple for sure. It's not good enough in footy and it's not good enough in the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race. I just did it for Nikki and Kazzy... I know, love. And now Nikki's hardly even talking to me. She hates me. She could never hate you. Yeah, she could. Potato racing is a big deal in the hearts of a lot of Appleton women. I know! I'm married to one. You keep going, love. I'm proud of you. [phone alerts chiming repeatedly] Popular girl. It's probably just council again complaining about the posters. [phone alerts keep chiming] [laughs] Uncle Bob, look. Oh my God. [laughs] Wow. [laughs happily] [phone keeps chiming] Mabes! [Mabel barks] -Mabes. Look. -[phone keeps chiming] Look at all these donations. Look. Hey. We are up to 15 hundred dollars. Check that out. TikTok numbers: 1.3 million views, 900 K likes, 100 K comments. What are people saying? [both] Never read the comments. -Why not? -Because they're usually awful. -Oh. -GoFundMe, we've made $10,000. -Whoa! -It's going up really quickly. Wow. We could make 20 grand. But we only need to make it equal. What would we do with more than that? Make it the world's richest potato race for women. Show this town that even if they don't care about equality, the rest of the world does. But I only meant and said on the GoFundMe this year's race. So, let's... cut it off. -Cut it off. -[alerts keep chiming] [computer chimes] [Penny] Good. A small town in regional New South Wales is getting a roasting as a local woman fundraises to make their potato race equal. I just thought it was unfair that the men's race gets $2,000 and the women's race gets 200. Donations have poured in from around Australia and the world, but some in town are spitting chips. The men's and the women's race just aren't the same. Okay? We don't need this shit. Yep. Too right. [TV reporter] Donations have poured in from all... [news stops] [pensive music playing] G'day! Billy Hindmarsh with you from Appleton FM. Five days to go to the show, and let me tell you, I'm hearing the competition's really hotting up for the ladies' race. All this media attention has fired up people from all over... Hello, Appleton Supermarket. Barb speaking. [woman] Is this Barb Brickner? Barb Brickner, yes. Would you like to make a comment about the potato race? No, I don't have a comment about the race. Well, we were just thinking... [indistinct] [laughs] Thank you. Are you on the Facebook? Facebook, Joan. We can't have you sounding old-fashioned. I am bloody old-fashioned. Have you got the Facebook? Of course. What is it? Bring up the Appleton Community Page. Apparently, it's kicking off all over the Facebook. Bloody Penny. -[Barb gasps] -What is it? [Barb] Kylie Pearce has written, "That B-I-T-C-H should stick to pap smears and let the locals do the potato races." [gasps] And look what your Gavin's saying about my Penny. Gavin? Who's Ainslie Parker? I don't know any bloody Ainslie Parker. Mark said there were trolls on that page. Maybe she's a troll? This one says he's going to find us, clock us to death with potatoes, and chuck us over the falls in the sacks. Christ. What are we going to do? We'll have to call an extraordinary general meeting. Penny's raised a lot of money. Too much, apparently. [Joan] So what? She shouldn't be rewarded for that. For breaking the rules. Well, she has, and we can't just ignore it. Righto. Extraordinary general meeting tomorrow night. Can't be tomorrow. Everyone will be at Nikki's fortieth. Can't be Sunday. Heritage Tomato Club are in the hall. Well, it'll just have to be Friday. -The day before the race. -Righto. Put a notice on the Facebook. [phone ringing] Yes, Barb speaking. Hi, Barb, this is Gail from the Southern Daily. No, we don't have a comment to make at the moment. Oh no, I understand. But we're just putting together a story... No, I don't want to be part of the story. Yes, well, surely, it's a community issue. Thank you. Bye. [pensive music playing] [Nikki panting] -Time. -Um... Two minutes 50? Give it to me. It can't be. I'm sorry, Mum. I dropped it. -Ethan, for fuck's sake. -Sorry. Why can't you do anything properly? [car doors opening] [indistinct chatter] All right, let's go, girls. Not too late to beat them girls. Piss off, Gavin. A lot of money at stake now, so I'm hearing. I'm not going to dirty race. [laughs] You Andersons and your dirty racing. There's nothing dirty about having a strategy. [Nikki] I'm not into a strategy that hurts other potato racers. I want to win fair and square. [Miriam] Ready. Set. Go. Against them? Good luck, Nicola. [girl] This is so much heavier than I thought it would be. A thousand bucks of your winnings and I'll make sure that you'll win. -[pensive music playing] -[indistinct chatter, laughter] I said piss off, Gavin. [pensive music continues] [birds calling, singing] It's 7:45, love. I'm going to head off to the shop. Do you think you can manage without me today? [Bob] I think so, Barbie. You think you'll be all right for Nikki's party later? Oh, I'm sure. You rest up, love. [sighs heavily] -[music playing indistinctly] -[indistinct chatter] [upbeat music playing] -Another one? -No, I'm all right. [man shouts] -Come on. -I can't. -[woman] Soda water. -Yeah. -Cher from Clueless. -Bingo. -[Nikki] Woo. -You girls all look absolutely fan-bloody-tastic. And you are...? I'm Dennis Lillee, the greatest test cricket fast bowler of all time. [Nikki] Dennis Lillee? Christ Almighty, Uncle Bob. How old do you think I am? Okay, he retired from test cricket in 1984, but his legend lives on. [laughs] Nikki! Oh my God! Mermaid! I love it. [both laughing] [Miriam] Happy birthday, Nikki. What, we're both Madonna? So good. [upbeat music playing] Let's dance, Nikki. I love this song. [all cheering] [whooping, cheering] Your hair. ["Born To Be Queen" playing] * Born to be queen * Conquering everything * So, boys, bow down to me Bow down to me * * Like royalty * The crown fits perfectly * * Call me "Your Majesty" * * 'Cause I was born to be queen * -["Pressure Down" starts playing] -Oh. This. * Oh, yeah * Set the wheels in motion * And watch them turning round * * I want to sail Across the ocean... * Don't you remember this part? * I've grown weary of this town * * Take the pressure down * 'Cause I can feel it It's rising like a storm * * Take hold of the wheels And turn them around * * Take the pressure down Yes. * In this city full of danger We lead our separate lives * Come on. * And I was frightened By a stranger * * With desperation in her eyes * ["This Is What My Youth Is" playing] * Wake me up after the sunset... * -[Eddie coos] -Yeah. That's cool, huh? It's not like any of these trolls actually come to my house or anything. It's all what Bob calls keyboard warriors. When are you going to go back to work? Bob actually prefers it there by himself. [music playing indistinctly] [Penny] Nikki. Nikki! There you are. -Are you having a good time? -Having a great time. Good. Here's your present. How much did this cost? It's your fortieth. Yeah, but I buy myself a ticket to a musical with my potato race money. Well, now you don't have to, and you can take someone and stay in a nice hotel. That one's just around the corner from the theatre. Why didn't you just put the money that this was into the potato race, and we could just stop all the drama? Ugh, you're such a dickhead. -What? I'm the dickhead? -Yes, you are. You are the dickhead. It's not fair that you work harder than everyone else in this town to just scrape by. I wanted the prize money to be equal so you would have some more money. I don't need your money. I don't need you putting 50 bucks in my wallet every time you come over. I don't need you buying my kids expensive presents or, or, or putting rent into my bank account. I need you to fuck off and leave me alone. And I'm sorry that I had three kids and that you couldn't have any, I'm sorry that your life has fallen apart in the city, and I'm sorry I married your boyfriend. But he's turned out to be a drunk anyway, so I guess you won that one too. Yeah, don't blame me for the shitty decisions that you've made with your life. Oh, now it comes out. Don't blame me because you were too scared to leave this place and have an actual life and risk doing something that you actually liked. Like, you're a loser, Nikki, and a dumb loser. A loser who would sacrifice getting some more money in a potato race so she doesn't beaten by actual competition. [Joan] There you both are. Come in for cake. [guests] * Happy birthday to you * * Happy birthday to you * Happy birthday, dear Nikki * * Happy birthday to you * [all] Hurray. -[Bob] Hip, hip... -[all] Hurray. -[Bob] Hip, hip... -[all] Hurray. [applause, cheering] Speech. [voice shaking slightly] No, no, no, no. No, no. I'll be right. Let's eat cake. Can I say something? Um. [soft laugh] [Mark clears throat] Happy birthday to my wife, Nikki. It was a surprise, us building a life together, but somehow we've done it. Things were rough, mate, I was doing odd jobs, and this one day I get a call to install some basins at the hairdressers, and, bugger me, Nikki's there doing her apprenticeship, and... [guests laugh] ...shit bricks, somehow she'd gotten even more beautiful from school. [guests] Aww. She asked me if I was training for the potato race. [laughs] Training became the highlight of me week. And then Ethan came along, and... [hoots and cheers] And here's to Nikki. [guests cheering] Nikki! [Mark] I'm proud of the family she's kept together. Ethan with his apprenticeship. [applause] Elliot going to Sydney for his music. [applause, cheering] [tense music playing] Eddie surviving putting the wrong thing in his mouth. [laughter] We're a lucky family. And that's what counts. Happy birthday, Nikki. We all love you. -[man] We love you Nikki. -[cheering] [downbeat music playing] Aunty Barb, can you take me home? Come on, love. See you at home. -Thank you. Good night. -Night. [downbeat music continues] [Dr Holliday] Come on. -You're officially bananas. -[Dr Holliday laughs] I like to ride down the road in the middle of the night. Feel the Appleton chill on my face. Dream I'm a bushranger. I think I'm going to go back to Sydney. You've had a rocky start. No, I was cruel to my sister tonight. I was so cruel. She probably deserved it. No, she didn't. And Aunty Barb's hardly getting out of bed, and I've got Joan starting computer training after the show and it's already giving her anxiety. Like, actual anxiety. Joan Bunyan, a person you know thinks mental illness can be cured with an alarm clock and a walk up the hill. Like, I came back here to be with my family... [sighs, sniffling] All I've done is hurt them. [sobbing] Come and pat Nugget. [sighs] [laughs softly] I'm all right for now, thanks. Pat Nugget. It'll make you feel better. I promise you. -[chuckles] -[Nugget nickers] -See? -[laughs tearfully] Yeah. Patting Nugget is rather lovely. I just don't deserve to feel lovely right now. You know, when Graham and I first got here, we decided we weren't going to hide what we were, even though Appleton is... Appleton. We lived here together, we went on runs together, joined the footy club together. We even went in your beloved potato race together. Graham nearly beat your Pop, as it happens. People couldn't stand us. Thought we were flaunting our lifestyle. The surgery was pretty much empty for the first six months. It took time, but people eventually got used to us. Then, they loved us because we're so charming. [laughs softly] You'll be loved too in exactly the same way in a good 15 or 20 years. What I'm saying, dear student, is that people here need you. And maybe you need them too. Come on. Off we go. [Nugget whinnies] [pensive music playing] [upbeat music playing] [magpies singing] [upbeat music continues playing] G'day! Billy Hindmarsh with you from Appleton FM. Well, tomorrow is the big day. The one day of the year we're all looking forward to, the Appleton Show, and, as expected, locals are going to face tough competition from women all over the state. This year's Appleton Ladies' potato race... [clock ticking] [exhales] [ticking continues] [indistinct chatter] [Joan] Shh, shh, shh, shh. All right, shh. Shush, everyone. Be quiet, please. It's... shh. [Kazzy whistles sharply] It's 5:00 p.m. I declare this extraordinary general meeting of the Appleton Show Committee to order. Present are Joan Bunyan, president. Barb Brickner, secretary. Apology from Billy Pope, committee member in charge of entertainment. Apology from Billy... Never mind about them, Barb. Those bastard Billies are never here. We are here to discuss the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race fundraising campaign where $12,000 has been raised -without... -[hoots and cheers] ...without permission from the Appleton Show Committee. On the agenda to speak are Gavin Bunyan... [scattered applause] ...and Dr Penny Anderson. [louder applause] [Joan] Gavin! [Gavin clears throat] Bloody ridiculous amount of money, even if it was for a sport that women could do properly. [woman] What? [Gavin] No, put the money into a kitty and support this race into its future. After Saturday's race, at least three of the boys will need physio. Pay for it. -[loud, indistinct murmuring] -Thank you. This, this race kicked off in the early 1900s to celebrate the blokes... Ooh, God forbid, to celebrate the blokes that did all the hard work. -[supportive murmuring, applause] -They didn't, yeah, they get the profit from a good potato yield, but they got the glory of showing everyone how strong they were. How athletic they were. And then... and then someone, yeah, comes along and tricks us into letting the chicks run as well? -[crowd shouts disapprovingly] -And, and, hey, and now, now, they want the same prize money, but they don't even do the same amount of work. It's bloody bullshit. -Language! -No. [supportive shouts, applause] The ladies' race, I'll finish on this, the ladies' race is a sideshow. Don't waste good money on it. -Gavin Bunyan. -[applause] Go home! Boo! -Penny? -[Barb] No, Joan! I'd like to say something in response to Gavin, please. But your name isn't on the agenda. I just put it on the agenda. [Barb clears throat] Hello, everyone. Barb Brickner nee Anderson here. Fifth-generation potato racer. [applause, cheering] I've always loved the race. Something about the speed, the strength, the potatoes. [laughter] Let's keep it moving, Barb. 30 years ago, I got sick of watching my pop and my dad and my brothers do the race so I got dressed up as a bloke and I did the race myself. [applause] Kev Bunyan got wise to me just after the third turn. [woman] I remember that. He tried pulling me off. But I kept going. I showed everyone that a lady, I mean, a woman, can run the potato race. [loud applause] Here's me winning the inaugural Ladies' Potato Race the following year. -[loud applause] -[cheering] But, I didn't have the guts back then to ask for equal prize money. But I do now! Do it, Joan. We need to do it! [Joan] Righto, righto. [applause] Penny, you're up. After that, we'll take a public vote on it. [applause] [exhales] I drive home past the footy fields where a whole heap of mums are coaching kids playing soccer. And I drive past the shops where the women are buying the dinner for the night that they will probably go home and cook. After working all day and feeding their kids at night, a whole bunch of them train for the potato race as if it was the Sydney Marathon or the Olympic hundred-metre freestyle. [women] Yes. And we dare to pay them a fraction of the prize money for running the exact same race, the exact same distance, on the exact same day in front of the exact same crowd? I don't think so. It's the 21st century. [loud applause] Come on. Kazzy Pearce just had a baby and she's running in it on the weekend. [applause] Look at that board up there. Who's name is on it more than anyone's? My sister. -Nikki Anderson Bunyan. -[applause] Now, if she was a bloke, her ten years of winning would have bought her a new car. So we need to make this the richest potato race on earth tomorrow for the women to right a great Appletonian historical wrong. Ten thousand for the winner and the rest divided between the place-getters. [applause] Let's show them that the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race is running into the future! [applause, cheering] Everyone present is allowed a vote. Raise your hand if you think the money should not go to the ladies' race on show day. Raise your hand if you think it should. [woman cheers] [laughs] [Barb] Tomorrow's Ladies' Potato Race will be the richest in Appleton history. [loud applause, cheering] She's gone and done it. [applause, cheering continue] [no audible dialog] [radio host] Well, it's a beautiful day here in Appleton after the usual foggy start. We have the perfect day out for you. It's been a great potato season this year, particularly good for the reds and the Dutch creams. We're not far away from the start of our annual potato races, and in the women's event, will Nikki Bunyan keep her crown? Not long to go now. ["All My Friends Are High" playing] * Do you feel The weather changing? * * The clouds are getting heavy * * They're holding you down * Holding you * * Do you see the colours fading * * They seem less saturated * You're coming down * So good. * You're coming down * * You're boring... * -Hey, Rania. -Goat curry? -Yep. -Makes you run faster. Sorry, sorry. * That's pouring through your blood While you're dancing in the crowd * * Do you feel it? Do you feel it? * * All my friends are high * * While I'm alone In the coloured lights * * Strangers overnight * * I guess that candy Just hit you right... * [Barb] How are things looking for the race? Don't know if I feel like telling you, you bloody traitor. [Barb scoffs] -Filled up in half an hour. -Terrific. Nikki was right. Every CrossFit bimbo between Bowral and Boggabri. Brisbane too, I reckon. Many of the local girls? Kazzy. Rania's daughter, Miriam. Nikki, of course. [Joan] Is that those Billys up there in the commentary box? They haven't done a bloody thing all year, and now they sit up there like they're Richie Benaud? Not today. Not this race! It needs to be a lady in the box today. A lady who knows all there is to know about the potato race. -No, Joan. -It needs to be you, Barb. Come on. * All my friends are high * While I'm alone In the coloured lights... * [Billy] Well, the stakes certainly are high for the girls this year in the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race there, Bill. Well, the stakes are always high, Bill, in the Appleton Potato Race. The men's race. Yes, isn't that the truth there, Bill? And I tell you what, I wouldn't mind winning ten Gs. You might finally shout a round of schooners there, Bill. [guffaws, laughter] Yeah, righto. I might do that. I might. [Joan] Get out. Out. Why? Ugh! Bloody women. [drum roll] -[bagpipes playing] -[crowd whistles, cheers] [crowd members shouting, applauding] [commentator speaking indistinctly] We'll just check the bags, then we're ready to go. Yeah, I'm hitting, like, around two minutes, usually. -Excuse me, are you Nikki Bunyan? -Yeah. As in, ten-time champion of the Appleton Ladies' Potato Race? Yeah, that's me. Oh my God, can I please get a selfie? Can I get one too? -Please. -Yes. [other women laughing] -[phone camera clicks] -Oh, thank you. Oh my God. Oh my God. [Barb] While the competitors are making their way to the track for this year's Appleton Ladies' Potato Race. It's hard, mate, 'cause your shoulders don't want to admit it, but your boobs are your best friend in the potato race. Think of them like talismans. They're, like, lighting the path to victory. It's the mistake everyone else makes. They forget about the importance of upright boobage. Pow! Pow! Oh! Did you get the Ns on the back? I didn't think you guys would do that. Look at you all. [man 1] Yeah, just... -[man 2] Line up, girls. -[man 1] Everyone, line up. -[man 2] Here we are. -[man 1] Got to be careful. -[man 2] Good stuff. -Where's Penny? -She's over there. -She's over there. [man] 26. Get it? You ready? Is she racing? -Looks like it. Get out there. -Go, Mum. -All right. Thank you. -Go get them, babe. [Elliot and Ethan] Go, Mum. Woo. [Barb] And now they're loaded up with sacks, heading to the starting line. What are you doing? Well, you're not a true local until you run a potato race. You don't have any training. You will hurt yourself. I'll be right. Go win that ten grand. Hi. Hey. I'll do you, love. Come here. I'll load you up. There you go. I got hers. I got hers. [grunts] You got that? All right. Two seconds. Okay. -Smash it. There you go. -[sombre music playing] Good luck. Should be good. Bloody love the ladies' race. [tense music playing] On your marks. Get set. [gunshot] [cheering, applause] And they're off to a good start. Nikki Bunyan out in front. Just ahead of Kazzy Pearce. Penny Anderson bringing up the rear. [applause, cheering] The rest standing nicely. [ripping sound] Nikki Bunyan's out in front! Behind her, Miriam Hamid and Kazzy Pearce. [panting heavily] [Barb] Going well. Going well. [Barb gasps] Something's-- something's happened on the track! [racers gasp] It's potatoes! [Penny groans] One down. Two down! It's carnage! Potato carnage! But the race goes on. Nikki Bunyan still in front. Keep going. Miriam, keep going. Nikki Bunyan stops. Nikki goes back. [applause, whistles, cheering] Miriam and Kazzy power on ahead of the pack. What are you doing? -Get up! -Piss off. -Get up. -It's ten grand! -Get up. -Get back to the race. We're going to share your bag across both our shoulders. -We are finishing this race. -[Penny groans] Okay. You hold onto me, okay? [Barb] Oh, here she comes. [motivational music playing] -You're such a dickhead. -You're the dickhead. [Barb] They're about to cross the finish line. It's Miriam Hamid! [cheering, applause] And she's done it! Miriam Hamid takes it. Miriam Hamid takes the race. Oh! The richest Ladies' Potato Race in Appleton history. [emotional music playing] Here they come. [cheering, applause] Nikki and Penny cross the line, last place. [Penny laughs] Congratulations. [cheering, applause] [Penny] I'm so sorry that I tripped and I'm, I'm sorry that I just... I tried to take over something that... Don't be dumb. I am so sorry. [panting] Look how wonderful this is. [crowd cheering, applauding] It's like a real sport now. It's the best thing ever, Pen. [both panting, laughing] [Nikki] Oh. [Penny] Oh, what is this? Okay, you know the last in a race gets a wooden spoon? In a potato race, obviously, it's a potato masher. Thank you. [cheering, applause continues] [Barb] Gavin Bunyan, can you please report to the marshals? Gavin Bunyan. And also, your mother would like to speak to you. You're in big trouble! ["Steer" playing] [Nikki] Pen. [Mark, Elliot cheering] * Feel it falling off Like clothing * [Nikki] Ethan! Come on! * Taste it rolling on your tongue * -[cheering, shouting] -[Barb] Ethan! * See the lights above you glowing * * Oh, and breathe them * Deep into your lungs * [applause, cheering] * It was always simple * Not hidden hard * You've been pulling at the strings Playing puppeteer for kings * * And you've had enough * * But the search ends here * Where the night is totally clear * * And your heart is fierce * * So now you finally know that You control where you go * -[computer beeps negatively] -* You can steer * * So hold this feeling Like a new-born * * Of freedom surging Through your veins * * You have opened up a new door * * So bring on the wind * Fire, and rain * * It was always simple * Not hidden hard * You've been played at a game * * Called remembering your name * * And you stuffed it up * * But the search ends here * Where the night is totally clear * * And your heart is fierce * * So now you finally know that You control where you go * * You can steer * [song ends] [gentle instrumental music playing] [motivational instrumental music playing] [music ends]
