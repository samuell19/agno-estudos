[Rachel] I'm just trying to understand why. [Dr. Grillo, on phone] You know why. -You didn't put in the effort. -But... but I did, sir. All my course papers were handed in on time my sources were listed, but yet you still gave me an F. Rachel, I don't have to justify the grade I gave you. So that's it? I'll have to carry over the course next semester? Well, that's entirely up to you. Meaning what? It's unofficial. I haven't handed in the grades to the faculty yet. Then, sir, you can please take another look at my paper and reconsider. Please. Maybe. Dr. Grillo, what can I-- Don't mention my name! Why did you mention my name? I'm sorry, sir. Please. I can't take another semester just because of an elective course. Please help me. Please. You'll have to help me to help you. I... I don't understand. Okay. No problem. Wait, hold on, sir! Sir? Are you there? Sir? -Dr. Grillo? -Stop mentioning my name. I'm sorry, sir, but please help me. Please. Rachel, I don't have time for this. No, no, no, sir, please don't cut the call. Are you ready to do the needful? Yes or no? [sighs] What do I need to do? The Sunrise Motel. -I know it. -Tomorrow. 6pm. Go and pay for a room there. -Then call me. -Jesus! Really? Otherwise I hand in the grade as it is. Finito! [line goes dead] [Students ranting] Gentlemen, wait, wait! This is the last act you'll do in this university. I am a Christian. Ahh! Apostle. Carry him! [crowd screaming] Meaning you could have chosen a path far less destructive and consequential than that taken by you. This university has a forum for airing such grievances but you ignored that platform to take to the option of being the jury and... uh, judge... in a complaint that had not been brought before the senate. That arbitrary decision has resulted in a loss of life. That is a matter for the judiciary outside this citadel of higher learning to deliberate upon. But as far as this institution is concerned, all three of you, including the one that ran away, are hereby rusticated from the university. Your academic records are henceforth expunged in their entirety. That is our ruling. [Kwesi] No, no, no. Wait, Remi. Hold on, look, you're not even 21 years old yet. [Gloria] Would you leave the poor girl alone? What is your problem? Why are you hounding her? [Pidgin] Are you the one paying her school fees? It's okay, Gloria. If I had one naira for every time someone was amazed by how young I am I'd be a millionaire in dollars by now. Just 20 and you're already sitting for your Masters? Hmm. Hmm-mm. I was still writing my university entrance exams in Accra... -when I was 20. -But that is the difference. [Ibibio] You are a dullard. You know what I mean? Like a compound dullard. That's the difference. What does "Nton" mean? Charlie, don't worry, it means nothing. But you're just an amazingly, intelligent young man. Anyway, age is a question of mind over matter. -Tell him. -If you don't mind, it does not matter. -Philosophy 101. -Come on, come on. -[sighs] -Oh, no! Professor Osagie! -I hope he's not taking this course. -Why? Well, he lectured in Ghana during my bachelor's degree. The man is stingy with grades. In my whole four years as an undergraduate I never saw that man smile once. Um... Good morning, class. Good morning, sir. Um... For those of you who don't know me... I do. ...I am Professor Osagie, dean, postgraduate college. Scholars... we are in the presence of... academic royalty. He graduated... a first-class honors degree in social science... from the Sorbonne University in Paris... at a tender age of seventeen. [students murmuring] -At seventeen? -He then polished off a PhD... -Sound familiar? -...in Humanities at Harvard University. Having lectured in various higher institutions, he was appointed... as a special envoy in conflict zones in Sudan and Iraq by the United Nations. We are therefore indeed honored to have him in this institution as your... senior course supervisor... for your master's degree programs. Professor Lucien N'Dyare. My, my, my! After this type of introduction, I feel like I should just stand here and pose for photographs. [students laughing] Wow. I think I've just met the father of my unborn babies. Thank you very much, Professor. You are welcome. The dean is somewhat... correct, because I am from Senegal. But my mother is from the Benin Republic and my maternal grandmother is from Nigeria. -Wow. -I guess that makes me a Nigerian. [students laughing] I am... looking forward... to embarking on this journey with all of you. So I wish you the best of all, the best of luck, and, um... thank you very much for having me. -Once again, you are welcome. -Yes. Thank you. -Excuse me, sir. -Just a minute, sir. Please just a minute of your time. Just one question, please. Just one question. -Okay. -Prof, why is there so much controversy surrounding the line of demarcation between India and Pakistan? Is China's rising dominance a sign that communism is indeed now a coded password? The rise of xenophobia in South Africa, why is it coming from the blacks whom we freed, rather than coming from the whites whom we campaigned against during apartheid? Are you single? [chuckles, sighs] -No, I'm married. -Ouch. Your friend has no shame. She'll soon ask the learned fellow to guess her bra size. Blessed with two children who reside in Paris. Mr. Kwesi, come on. Everyone is impressed with his credentials. Uh, the prof's credentials are the last thing on Gloria's mind, trust me. Why don't you just ask her out already? It's pretty obvious you've been crushing on Gloria -since forever. - Yeah, right. [laughs] I see. but we can still, you know, show you around. So regarding your question, India-Pakistan situation is extremely complex... What? Look, I was only trying to see if I could gather some, you know, extra classes. Sure. Look, let's go, girl. [whistle blows] -[instructor calling out] -[students replying] Good class, everybody. One minute break. Gather round together. Okay, so that's how it should be... Girl! You have to take it easy on me. Auntie, fetch the ball. So now this is my turn to serve. -Serve. -Okay, here we go. Yes! That's a smash. Go get the ball. -Hey. What's up? -My ball? Looking for this, huh? My name is Koyejo. Final year. Med school. And over there is my brother. He's a lecturer and he's into basketball. [Yoruba] My elder brother. So what's your name? -Moremi. -Oh, my goodness. Bloody Jambites. I'm not asking for your hall of residence. I'm asking for your name. [Yoruba] My name is Moremi. -The ball? -What? [Yoruba] So you can speak Yoruba? Huh? You are saying it like you are speaking Egun dialect. [laughs] My ball. -Where were you during freshers week? -Moremi! -What's going on? -I'm coming. Where were you? Hmm? What were you looking for during freshers week? -[English] The ball? -Okay. [English] Somebody's got attitude. -[Pidgin] Take. -Thanks. Okay. So what does Jackie Chan want? -Serve. -Really, you're not going to tell me? The social and economic ramifications of a political process that does not include... the will of the citizenry... will always conclude in a conundrum. Leading to the breakdown of that very political process... that spur the extremity in the first place. Now, a perfect example is the 1956 British handling of the Suez crisis. Yes, they brought down the government of the Prime Minister Anthony Eden. But at the same time, they turned Egypt's Colonel Nasser into a hero. The British were simply protecting their neo-colonial interest. They did not take into account the social and economic will of a group of people who just had enough... of the British interference... in their internal affairs. That's your toaster out there. Now... the Suez crisis became a clarion call... a reference point to the rest of Africa... still under colonial rule. I can't... [chuckles] No, no. [French] Excuse me. Kwesi, everybody... I hope that you are not just quoting me verbatim? This is a master's degree program. I don't want you to just lap it all up. I want you to analyze it, disagree with it, even. This is not dogma. Ehnn? This is an intellectual discourse. We are all learning here. Well, the only difference is that I am being paid. [students laughing] All right, now I've divided the class into... five tutorial groups. One over which I will preside, and the rest will be shared amongst the other lecturers. So please come up and see what group you belong to. -Why is she so excited about everything? -Moremi! Okay, I will catch up with you guys. [sighs] [Yoruba] Yeah, how can I help you? First of all, hmm... I'm legit sorry. Okay? I swear down. I have been searching for you. I have looked everywhere for you. I went to every department, every faculty, even every cafeteria. And then it dawned on me. What if this girl is not even an undergraduate? What if she's postgraduate? God, as if the ground should open up and swallow me. I swear, I'm sorry. No need. I'd push you in myself. Mister "I'm Koyejo. Final year Med School." She got me. Will you ever forget that scenario? Will you ever? Eventually. Hmm! Eventually? -Eventually? Okay, that means we're cool? -Hmm. Do you still want me to push you in that hole in the ground? Please, please don't be angry. Don't push me into it. Don't push me into it. Can I... have your number? Please? Not to worry. You'll be fine. Remember what I said. It's not like a court, but a senate hearing carries a lot of weight. You are the complainant, he is the respondent. Only the panel will be allowed to ask questions. I cannot address the panel. Neither can I question the respondent, nor the... um, witnesses. And same goes for the representation of the respondent. But I will be allowed to whisper advice to you. It's a closed hearing. That's why we didn't bother to invite your parents. How are you holding up? Everyone on campus is staring at me. Your story has gone viral. I don't want to read any of it. We need the noise. -[sighs] -We need the publicity. I just want to stay in school, continue my studies. The Ajike Advocacy Centre hired me to give you the best representation at this hearing. I promise to do that, hmm? What happens if I lose? Do you remember the case of Dr. Grillo? A couple of years back? No, you wouldn't. Your first degree wasn't in Nigeria, was it? Dr. Grillo was a university lecturer whose conversation with a female student demanding for sex before he changed her grades was caught on tape. Now, instead of the female student to hand over to the university authorities the recorded conversation, her boyfriend decided to lay a trap for Dr. Grillo in a local hotel. Suffice to say, the entire escapade ended in a tragic death. And all the students involved, including the female student in question, were expelled from this university. And they were then jailed by a high court for manslaughter. So I could be rusticated too for slandering a lecturer? At least you didn't kill him. Let's go. I'd like to welcome everyone to this committee meeting and... first I'd like to introduce every member of the panel starting from Uzoamaka Chukwu, who is representing the student body. And on my right is Professor Osagie, one of our highly respected deans. To my left is our dearest Professor Yahaya. And Dr. Mrs. Nwosu. Thank you very much for being part of the panel. Obviously here is Miss Oluwa with her legal representation, and Professor Lucien and his legal representation. And I have the privilege to chair this session. My name is Professor Ibukun Awosika. So I'd like everyone to know that the entire proceeding will be audio-recorded by the clerk who is sitting over there, so we'll have no dispute about anybody's contribution. So, Miss Oluwa, shall we proceed? My, um... My first one-on-one contact with Professor N'Dyare was after a tutorial class. The political inclination of any nation has the most profound impact on the foreign policy of that country, in terms of how it deals with its neighbors. Now, Senegal and Gambia are both capitalist by nature. Imagine that one nation is a communist country with leanings towards Russia. And the other one was a capitalist economy with leanings towards the west. Yes? I don't think it would make any difference whatsoever. Sorry, I didn't get your name? Moremi Oluwa. Moremi. Moremi. During my tour of the campus, I saw a hall of residence with the same name. The university named a hall after you already? I mean you must be either highly intelligent or highly connected. Just a mere coincidence, sir. All right, go on with your point. When it comes to African countries, culture is a strong determining factor, so Senegal is a former French colony, Gambia British, yet culture trumps ideology. It takes far more than political inclinations to tear neighboring countries apart. What of Sudan and South Sudan, always at loggerheads? Well, that was formerly one country. Siblings disagree all the time. Just like North and South Korea. All right. Moving on... [French] This is just impossible, I can't drive this car. What a mess. Professor N'Dyare? -Moremi? -[French] Having issues with your car? You speak French? Yes, I have a French baccalaureate qualification. Did you take any electives in mechanical engineering? [laughs] [sighs] I must tell you... I don't want you to make fun of me. [English] I don't know how to drive stick. Excuse me? [French] I learnt how to drive in America on an automatic gear shift. But this university loaned me a car with a stick gear. You mean you don't know how to drive a car with a manual gear? Well... Stick. Your car key, sir? What do you intend doing? Shall we? Okay, Professor. I'm going to teach you how to drive a manual gear shift automobile. Where are you heading to? -Road 8. -Okay. Sir, you've got to understand... the gear ratio when driving manual. When driving stick. [Lucien] I think it's just too much information and jargon. Automatic is much more easier. [Moremi] But with manual, you're in control, the one in the driver seat. In an automatic, gear change is automated. [Lucien] l guess you like to be in control. [laughs] Thank you so much. You're very welcome, sir. I might have to ask the university for a driver, or get an automatic car instead. Just practice, it makes perfect. If you continue to teach me, then no problem. Please come in. The least I can do is offer you a drink, some refreshments? That's okay, I was heading to the supermarket when I ran into you. -But it's a long way from here. -There's a bus stop around the corner. Ah. Okay. Well, thank you. Goodbye. Wow. -Excuse me? -Sorry. Good. Um... Professor N'Dyare. In your first account of the same encounter, you declared that it was Miss Oluwa... who actually said to you that she was coming into your residence. Is that correct? She said she had time to kill. And I... I told her it would be highly inappropriate for me to invite her in. I thanked her for her service... and she left. Liar! Okay, as things are getting a little heated I think it will be a good point for us to take a break for lunch, and when we come back from lunch we can pick up things and continue. Thank you very much for your time. A penny for them? The panel... I saw a lot of doubt on their faces today. Especially from my own dean, Professor Osagie. Should I tell you how I met my husband? After law school, I was a junior associate in a law firm, and he was a senior partner at the same firm. He asked me out three times before I finally agreed to go on a date with him. We've been married now for... 21 years, have three adorable but seriously troublesome children. My point is... He was my senior in the workplace. Now after the third time, would it not be considered harassment in today's context? There's a thin line between wooing and oppression, especially when one party has power over the other. What we must do... is make sure that we erase the doubt from the minds of the panel. I have to return these calls, okay? See you in there. Hey. Mr. Kwesi, you're a witness! You're not supposed to be talking to me. Yeah, right. They should come and arrest me then. So how are you doing? Be careful you're not being used. You've become the poster girl for every woman with a grudge against a male lecturer on this campus. Yeah. They all think they can swim, until somebody drowns. Remi, I... Look, I shouldn't have left you alone that night after the Easter party. I should have waited. Mr. Kwesi... it's okay. All right, See you. [sobbing] And... well, that takes us back to the situation of the refugees. The refugees camp, displaced person, IDP... All over. We are not taking any questions. And, in any case, for those of you who... have not yet understood, or who are not following, please refer to my... page 12 and 14 of the materials. Some of you are in possession. I've given it out. You know how to get it. And then... now to the real situation of international relations flashpoints all over the world. Let us... A situation whereby a no-fly zone... has been established in an airspace. [Lucien] Hence, society tends to mirror that which it reflects. Now, if we take any group of people and we ask them if they're happy with the government they have, if they say no, chances are that they're living in a society where freedom of speech is enshrined in the constitution. If they say yes, well, chance is that it's a totalitarian society where fear is the order of the day. Now, in that scenario, how does an arbitrator mediate to the best interest of the party that brought the grievance to the table? -Yes, Kwesi? -Sir, you don't mediate to the interest of the party that brings the grievance. You mediate to the interest of all parties concerned. Hmm. What if serving all parties inadvertently put one country at a disadvantage? Hmm. Well, sir, if anyone had the answer to that brainteaser, -there would be peace in the Middle East. -[laughter] Yes, Moremi? Somebody is going to walk away unhappy regardless. What if hostilities are declared, based on a failed resolution? Resolutions that lead to an escalation of hostilities are not resolutions. They are proxy wars, fought under the guise of covert economic and political interest. So you'd do away with resolutions altogether? No, sir. I just wouldn't present a resolution as one if it has no chance of resolving anything. Otherwise you'd have Rwanda all over again. A situation in which UN peacekeeping forces stood aside whilst up to a million people were brutally massacred. That's not a resolution. That's genocide. All right. Well, all I know is that jollof rice originated from Senegal. [students laughing] [Kwesi] Come on! Come on, jollof rice is from Ghana! All right, calm down! Calm down! Listen, Kwesi. Nigerians will never agree with you. All right, so now let's look at the aspect of human rights violations within the framework of a failed state. -Okay, all right. -Yeah? [sighs] I don't know why it keeps stalling. Calm down. You're pulling your foot off the clutch too fast. There has to be a balance between the accelerator and the clutch. There is no logic to this. We have two legs. Why make three pedals? It is ridiculous. Listen, start the car again. The gear needs to be in Switzerland before you start the ignition. Switzerland? Neutral. Switzerland - neutral. -Very funny. -Okay. Don't forget, ease your foot off the clutch whilst gently pressing the accelerator. Slowly, okay, slowly. Perfect! Brilliant! Very good, Professor. Well done. Okay, now you're going to shift it down into gear two. -Like this? -Perfect, very good. -You're really getting the hang of it. -That works. [laughter, indistinct chatter] I can see that you're now an expert. Thanks to you. You were very patient with me. -Thank you. -My pleasure, sir. I love to resolve conflicts. Conflict? Which conflict are we talking about? -There's no conflict. -Sir... I think the gearbox of this car would disagree with you. [laughs] What was it like working at the UN? Working in UN? It's nice, but quite stressful. When you're working for a common goal, people would want to frustrate your efforts. For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of working with the United Nations. You? Somehow I saw an academic in you. Well, first of all, my father is a retired diplomat. Then secondly... [Lucien] The Kevin Carter photograph. Sudan. 1993. -The famine. -Mm-hmm. A vulture waiting for an emaciated African child to die so that it can devour its remains. A photojournalist who could do nothing, but stood aside to record the image for posterity. I first came across that photo when I was 11 years old. It has haunted me ever since. It haunted the photographer, too. He committed suicide a year later. I vowed from that day to spend the rest of my life trying to make a difference to the world at large. Like your namesake Moremi Ajasoro? [chuckles] You've read about her? Of course, I did my research. Infiltrated the ranks of the Ugbo forest tribe, discovered their weakness, and... saved her people of Ile-Ife from invasion. She was quite the heroine. I can only aspire. We all aspire, my dear. But sometimes a prophet is without honor only in his hometown. Would you like to take a walk? Yes. You and I, we are new-age rebels. Rebels with a cause. -We ruffle feathers. -We roar. -Mansa Musa! -Che Guevara! -Toussaint Louverture! -Obafemi Awolowo! -Nelson Mandela! -Kwame Nkrumah! Moremi Ajasoro! [Lucien] This absolutely beautiful. [Moremi] It's amazing, look at this. Well... Um... That might be... all for the day. Please submit your term papers on time. Moremi! We were just talking about you. Listen, sister, we just want you to know that if there's any help you require -we are here for you. -Thank you. We know what you're going through, and we salute you for taking a stance for all the females on campus. That's why we've been distributing these flyers all over campus. These sex-for-grades scandals must stop! I really appreciate this, but I need to go. Remi, we are here for you always. We're your Ajike foot soldiers. -Anything you need, just holler. -Thank you! Okay. [both] We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you in the struggle against oppression and victimization! Bye! Keep them! Spread the word! Gloria! [Gloria] Birthday girl with the sauce! Thank you. Hi, Gloria. Thank you. I didn't even want to make a big deal, but Koyejo... -Hmm. -Look... if lover boy decides to make your 21st the hit event, what is your problem? Girl, chill. Well, to be honest, he's growing on me. Like I don't even know already! I know that. Look, all I'm asking for is, I must be the one to choose the uniformed color. -I have to choose the head tie. -Head tie? There are a few things I need to achieve in life before I walk down the aisle. Okay, like what exactly? Huh? Madam Secretary-General for United Nations? I already know that. Now tell me something else. Whatever, auntie. Anyway, you know Mr. Kwesi is going to be there tonight. Mm-hmm. And so what? Well, Mr. Kwesi has been crushing on a certain someone. Please, please, please. In case you have not noticed, I don't have time for all those small boys. Wait! What small boy? Look, babes... let me help you with that. You already know my stance. I have no time for all these small boys on campus. As long as you are a guy that is in this school, you are a small boy, and I don't have time for that, baby girl. Wait, so Mr. Kwesi, who is 40 years old, worked for 10 years in Ghana after his first degree, and then returned to school for his PG is a small boy? Sweetheart, let me help you with that. But you know, like I always told you, baby girl, but sugar, you've always known my preference in men. I mean, I've never hidden it from you. I like men like... you know, Professor Lucien. Excuse me? He is my kind of man. Honey, he's mature, he's... He's my kind of man, and look, listen, this man has always had eyes on you, okay? I am not... I didn't even make the cut for his tutorial classes, but you made it. Baby girl, come on now. Do it for your girl. Hook a girl up now, girlfriend. -Gloria! -Hook me up! Gloria! Respect yourself. Okay. But you don't like the guy. I like him, so what's up with you? He's married. He's our lecturer. What does that even matter? Okay. I'm not even going to entertain this. Come on, let's go. Baby girl, come on now. I can't even play with you. It was a joke. Please, I don't do lecturers. -Okay, okay, let's go. -I don't do lecturers. -You already know that. -Let's go. I was just playing with you. You're too "extra, please." [Koyejo] There you go. -Close those eyes, babes. -[Moremi] Where are we going? Don't worry about it. So you don't know the meaning of surprise again, huh? I understand surprise, but this is too much. It's not. It's not too much once it's Koyejo, and once it's for Moremi, -it's not too much -Aw, babes. -Just take a step. -Okay, okay. -One step at a time. -Okay, okay. And then... -[♪ Happy Birthday To You plays] -Oh, my God! -My pal! -[Seun Kuti] My brother! -Thank you. -How you doing? -Thank you so much. -Thanks for coming out. -Happy birthday, Moremi. -Thank you. You shall grow old and live long. Fine girl, thanks for coming out. I'm such a fan. Charlie, hope you're enjoying Nigeria? Yetty, please bring the cake. Oh, my God! I bought a cake for Remi. Have it. -Treat her well. -Normal. You guys have fun tonight. -I will see you backstage. -Thank you. -Enjoy. -I hail. I'm your fan. I'm your fan. Wow! [Pidgin] It's amazing Boo, how do you manage to do that? I'm telling you! So I didn't tell you Seun and I are cousins. Huh? Wait, so you are related to Fela? Uncle Fela? Seun's mum and my mum they are sisters. Wait! For real, for real, for real? I'm just kidding. And to think that I almost believed him. You're a fool, do you know that? -You're a fool? -I agree. What type of stunt, I mean... That was superb. Seun is my friend, anyways. You know, I met him through a friend, so we've been like this ever since. But you're a big guy now. I trust you. -You delivered. -You know now. Oh, my gosh. This has been my best birthday ever. Put it here. Mr. Man, don't even think it. Guys, where are we going to? Let's go somewhere. Let's just go. [Seun Kuti and the Egypt 80 Band playing] Greatest Nigerian students! Great! Greatest, greatest Nigerian students! Great! Stop! So mostly, yeah, at the tail end of the semester we're having this grading in our karate listing. So I am finally going for my... My baby, my black belt. Like I even know what that means. [laughs] Okay, let me explain it to you. [Yoruba] You see, in karate... -there are different stages, understand? -Mm-hmm. The first stage, as a beginner... -Yes. -..you start with white belt. -Okay. -Yeah. From white you move to yellow, from yellow you move to green, from green to blue from blue to brown, then finally the highest standard, black belt. -Black belt. -Yeah. Is it not all about fighting Chinese? [laughs] Wait, wait, wait. Besides, how do you even reconcile learning how to fight and training to be a doctor? -Really? -Yes. -Really? -Yes, really. Okay, okay. Karate is not solely about just fighting, are you listening? -It's more self-discipline. -Okay. -Do you understand? And self-defense. -Okay. Hmm. And... Um... Let me break it down, okay? Somebody is giving me a stance to work with. -Aha! -Where? -Let me give you a tip, yeah? -Where? You want to learn about karate? -Don't worry, Jackie Chan! -Wait. -No! -Babe, this might come in handy now. -Okay. -Calm down, let me show you. Let the master teach you how to do this thing. Okay, take for instance, yeah? Imagine an assailant, yeah, -holding on to your hand this way. -Yes. Your two hands and you can't break free, you can't do nothing. Two things you can do. First one, either you break free by force and run as fast as you can. Or you close in on the attack this way. Okay. [laughs] I hope you're not using style to tap current. [chuckles] I am tapping? -Oh, my goodness. -Yes. Will you be serious with this thing please? -Okay. -This thing might come in handy, and I am not joking about it. Please. You close in. You have to pull him in or pull her in, or whatever the case is, and use your knee cap. -Yes. -Yes, and you hit him in the scrotum. -In the what? -In the balls. -Jesus! -Mm-hm. -Okay, okay, okay. -You to want to try? Yeah, let's try, let's try again. Wait, calm down, okay? -Go on, try it. -Okay. Moremi… -Relax. -Relax what? -Relax. -Don't damage my family planning? Okay, okay, okay. Okay, yeah. -Like this? -Yeah, but a little harder. Okay. Like this? Babe, you're a witch. I'm not doing this thing with you again. -You're not even taking this serious. -Okay, okay, okay. -I saw you on Thursday -Yes? -With your lecturer. You guys drove past. -My course supervisor, yeah. -A lecturer? -Yeah. Professor N'Dyare. He's here on a foreign exchange attachment. He was actually at the show tonight. Seeing you with him like that... Are you listening? I don't like it. I was just teaching him how to drive manual. I don't like it. Okay. -No, you have to be careful. -Okay, okay, okay. And I'm serious about this. You know how some men see overfamiliarity as a green light. [sighs] Okay, I've heard you. -What is okay? -Okay. Before you now say that, I am jealous, yes. Yes, you're jealous, yes, you're very jealous. So I need to say it, so that you know. [Lucien] I made her understand that I was not in the business of securing jobs for students after graduation. She was very charming, tenacious. I had no idea there was an undercurrent to her modus operandi. Hence no immediate cause for alarm at the time. [Prof. Yahaya] Hmm. Professor N'Dyare, and what eventually raised the alarm bells for you? When Miss Oluwa... intimated that she was prepared to do anything... as long as she'd get that referral. Aha! And how did Miss Oluwa go about doing that to you? [whispering] By revealing that... she wanted to indulge me in a sexual relationship. Sorry, she legit told you that? Yes. In a one-to-one meeting we had at my office regards her dissertation. [Moremi, in French] I assumed that if I had a presupposition I have to defend it with research and citations. Yeah, with original content. I like your premise, and your first chapter is excellent, but for your chapter two and three I am not so sure. It talks more of the situation from a third party's point of view than it does from yours. It's like, whose dissertation is this? Is it yours? Or your source? Aside from that, let me hear your hypothesis. Take note of my comments in red. Okay, thank you, Professor. Professor? When it's just you and I together, you can call me Lucien. I'm not entirely sure that would be appropriate. But I insist. I'd rather maintain... the status quo. My old supervising professor at Harvard, I called him David. That is America, this is Nigeria. And I am Lucien. And I am Nigerian. The moment I call someone of your age difference by name... it means I have... I have stopped respecting you. Why are you always so defensive? You know, when you taught me how to drive stick... you were very relaxed. I was the tutor then. In control. Mm-hmm, then relax. Do you have a boyfriend? Yes. -The medical student? -How do you know? I know. And with your boyfriend, are you also in control? That's not something... I'm comfortable discussing with you. [laughs] So you can talk to me about the economic effect of Brexit within the European Union, but your sex life is a no-go area? Come on! So it is forbidden? Now you've really got me curious. I have a funny feeling that in bed you like riding horse. If that's all, I want to leave. That will be all. Moremi? My favorite color is red. In spite of my informing Miss Oluwa that... I do not appreciate any sexual advance from her... she pulled down her pants... and showed me a glimpse of her underwear. I was utterly shocked and embarrassed. Professor N'Dyare, after that incident, did you bring this matter to the attention of the dean of postgraduate school? Unfortunately not. Why? I wished not to adversely affect Miss Oluwa's coursework. And I thought she would get over her infatuation with me in due course. And did she get over the infatuation? There was no infatuation. Miss Oluwa, you will conduct yourself appropriately. -Yes, Professor N'Dyare? -[sighs] For a while. And then my tutorial class embarked upon a trip to Dakar. [Koyejo] Dakar? As in Senegal? [Moremi, in Yoruba] It's a field trip. It's part of my course requirements. Professor N'Dyare really had to pull some strings to get the trip approved. [Koyejo] N'Dyare? Same lecturer who tried to figure out your sexual preference? Come on, it wasn't quite like that, Koyejo. Okay, you're the one who came running to me with complaints. You told me Professor was talking inappropriately, like he's been inappropriate with you. Maybe I overreacted. [Koyejo] Maybe you don't want to read the writing on the wall. That was over a month ago, but everything's been cool since then. Remi, that man is on your case. It's okay, it's okay. Don't worry, it's okay. You see this field trip, eh? Truthfully, from my mind of mind, I don't like it. I don't want you to go. -Excuse me? -Yes! Join another tutorial group, do you understand? You guys are not the only group going on a field trip. There are different groups in the class, you can join another one. I'm not here to ask your permission. I came to inform you. So it's like that? Hmm? It's like that now? Dude! The last time I looked, it wasn't your signature on the check that pays my tuition fees. Koyejo! Koyejo! Lucien! Professor Sembene. [French] Good to see you. I'm pleased to see you too, our traveling professor. -In fact, in fact. -It's been quite a while. Indeed, good to see you. And this must be the Nigerian tribe that has adopted you. In fact, in fact. Everybody, please come down, come down. Let me introduce you to Professor. This time around, I brought ten students. I must say, they are all exceptional. The goal is to share some Senegalese culture with them -and to tour them around Dakar. -That's very good. Everybody is here? Yes, I believe so, yes. So it is my honor to introduce you to Professor Sembene. -Mm-hmm. -He's the head of, uh... of department of International Relations here at Université Cheikh Anta Diop. But more importantly, he's my old lecturer. -Not too old though. -[laughs] You're correct. -A very warm welcome to you all. -Thank you. I'll be hosting a reception for you at the Dean's lodge this evening where you can meet some of your Senegalese colleagues. He's saying that we are going to have a dinner tonight at the Dean's lodge. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. Is anyone fluent in French? French? She's my brightest star. -Yes? -She speaks French fluently. Moremi. -It's nice to meet you, Moremi. -Good day, Professor. -How are you? -I am fine, thank you. I am delighted. You will be the official interpreter. Yes, okay, with all pleasure, sir. -That's good. -Thanks a lot. All right, I will be waiting when you all are done for today. You're welcome and I will be the translator. -See you tonight. -See you all tonight. -Thank you, Doctor. -I'm going for an appointment now. -Very well, see you later. -Yes, see you later. See you tonight. Okay. Come on, guys, go up. It was so fun. It's beautiful. Oh, my gosh. -Thank you, Prof. -[students cheering] -My translator. -Good evening, sir. -How are you? -I'm fine, thank you. -Hope you are having a good time? -Mm-hmm. Thank you. So near, yet so far. I'm fine. I know that look. Lovers' tiff. don't let anyone spoil this wonderful experience for you. Don't believe a word this man says. I taught him everything he knows. Professor. [indistinct chatter] -As you can see. -What's that? I kept your old Peugeot for you. Really? You should have sold the jalopy. No! You used to love driving it. [laughs] Thanks for hosting us tonight, okay? So, we'll see you very soon. Okay, thanks, Uncle. -My translator. -Thanks, Professor. -Thanks a lot, sir. -Very well. Goodbye. Goodbye, everyone. [Prof. Sembene] In conclusion... it is imperative to weigh the social ramification of imposing economic sanctions vis-à-vis the political issues in that country. It's crucial to weigh the social consequences of these economic sanctions. ...otherwise an embargo will do more harm than good. That's it. Professor, finally, thanks once again. -Thank you, too. -Thanks for the privilege. -Dear students, thank you. -Thank you to my Nigerian students. [students cheering] Thank you, sir. -I think it's cool, you know. -It is really cool, to be honest. And next, after the market, we have more things and then, -you know-- -Hey! Hey! Check this out. [inaudible] So right here is something that was donated by Guadeloupe. That happened in 1999. It's called the Statue of the Liberation of Slaves. What we have here is very important to the island. It came from France back in 1902, 1904... [indistinct chatter] -Good afternoon. -Good day. -What is your name? -Samba. Where are we going? [Moremi] Beautiful. It's unbelievable. Even more beautiful at night. This is probably the best view of the country. I want you to... bask in the serenity of the view, before the others arrive with their noise and camera phones. That's it. I'll give you a few minutes... then bring your colleagues, enjoy. Don't go. Not yet, Professor. This is my village. I grew up here. -But you never mentioned it. -Right. As a child, I grew up without a shirt on my back. My father was the local market inspector, a drunk who spent his earnings on drink and women, while my mother and I lived destitute from hand-to-mouth. When I was in despair I would stand here at this very spot, then imagine that... if I could just spread my wings... I could conquer the whole world. I will take my leave now. Thank you. Finally. Thank you, Jesus. We're sorry to keep you waiting. -We shall go now. -All right. Where did you get to? I wandered. Got lost, he found me. [Lucien] It became very apparent that Miss Oluwa would do anything to be with me. Alone. But quite often a student can grow attached to a tutor, even of the same gender, based purely on academic admiration, without implying any sexual liaison, not so? Mm-hmm. Yeah, correct, madam. That's precisely what I assumed. In your report about that incident, you mentioned something about an awkward incident that happened at a bonfire somewhere in, um... -Cape Verde. -Yes, Cape Verde. But that was not part of your trip itinerary. No. Well, in Dakar... my class has been... swamped throughout the week with symposiums, seminars, joint classes with Senegalese counterparts. So on the last day I decided to fly everybody to Cape Verde, which is just an hour away from Dakar, at my expense. Just so they could relax and unwind from a most taxing week. [all singing] [Moremi] I know you're tired of her. Listen, I know Gloria can be a pain in the butt sometimes. But I know you miss her. Look, a pain I can deal with, but indifferent leaves me feeling like a mirage in the Sahara desert. Now you're just waxing philosophical. Gloria does not feel indifferent to you. Well, of late, she has been. I feel she's... seeing someone back on campus in Nigeria. No way! Gloria doesn't date small boys. Maybe he's not a student then. [sighs] Look, I've spotted her coming back from staff quarters on my early morning jogs. [phone ringing] -Mr. Kwesi, can you please hold this? -All right. You better come back quick or else I'll finish this. What will you expect me to do? So I'm just supposed to leave Senegal, go back to Lagos and do what? Do what? I told you that. Do you trust me? The professor is not even doing anything. I don't understand the problem. Okay, so I come back and then what? You're going to think that something happened with Professor Lucien? Cool. You know what? Can we end it? [French] Hello. Good day, Professor. You're alone. -I just needed some space. -Ah. Well, plenty of space here. Historical sources claim that... out from these very shores, 400 years ago... over a million African slaves were shipped. It makes me wonder... how many secrets are buried out in that sea. The doctor? -He broke up with me. -Oh. Sorry to hear. If he was dumb enough to let you go, then he was never smart enough to have you in the first place. I'm sorry. Moremi! [Lucien] She was upset. With issues from her personal life, with her boyfriend, I think. I comforted her. And then she tried to kiss me. She tried to kiss you? Yes, she did, but I stopped her, of course. Professor N'Dyare... when you returned to Nigeria, did you report the incident to the Dean? -No, I did not. -Really? Okay, fine. Did you report to anybody? Professor N'Dyare, you will answer for the record. I did not report the incident. I excused Miss Oluwa's behavior as an emotional outburst... to problems she was having in her personal life. Did you and Miss Oluwa ever refer back to that incident? It came in conversation. [Gloria] Gosh, I really missed. Like, I missed. It was really no biggie. Yeah, right. We went to that boring ECOWAS office in Abuja, my team and I, and you guys got to go to Cape Verde and Senegal. And you tell me I didn't miss much? Yeah, right. To be honest, I wish I hadn't even gone. Girlfriend, I heard all the juicy details. I mean, heard everything about you and the professor. Please! I heard you guys were bonded together, you know, like Nigeria and Cameroon. No wonder you were warding me off the guy. You already had eyes for him. [Pidgin] You are dating a genius, to be sincere. -Gloria, something happened-- - [Lucien] Moremi. Oh, shit! I was hoping to avoid him. -Okay, so I better be going. -No, no, stay with me, stay with me. I haven't seen you in class. I've been busy working on my dissertation, chapters four and five. [French] About what happened in Cape Verde. I'd rather not talk about that, sir. I acted inappropriately. I don't know what came over me. It was a moment of weakness that I now find utterly embarrassing. My profound apology. So you will return to class? Yes. Have a good day. What... Wait... What just happened? Nothing, come on. -Nothing? -Nothing. [Gloria] Remi! I guess after she apologized for her transgression, there was no need for me to take the case any further. Miss Oluwa apologized to you over that incident? Yes, she did, in front of her colleague Gloria Dokai. You can check, please. Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's been a full day, so I think we should shut down for the day and, uh, tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. we would start again, where we will take our witness testimonies. And at 12:00 we will reconvene to continue the session. Please do not forget my admonition. No personal contact or communication with any of the witnesses. It will not be tolerated in any form. Thank you very much, gentlemen and ladies, for your work. Have a good evening. [indistinct chatter] I'll see you guys tomorrow. Correct guy. Hold this sister well. Koyejo! Come on. [Yoruba] we're not supposed to be speaking. Even you? Ah-ah! It's shocking. -That's how highly you think of me? -No, that's not the point. That's not it. I warned you not to get overfamiliar with that man. You ignored me. I told you not to go to Dakar. You stubbornly went. Yeah, so... All I know is that you were my babe. But now... not anymore. All I know is... I wanted you to believe in me... but you don't. Oh, shit! Didn't I just see you communicating with a witness, due to give testimony at the hearing? I ran into him by mistake. Oh, really? You're PG? So tell me, what are you doing in med school? I had a migraine. I thought I could pick up a prescription. Can I see it? -The prescription, Miss Oluwa. -Babes... Give me a break. I'm just fighting for my life. Get some rest. I think that's a better prescription for migraine. Have a nice day. [Kwesi] Well, they were close, but I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I mean, despite their different capacities... intellectually they were on par. Well, Moremi always had this saying. I mean, she's fond of saying that age to her was just a function of mind over matter. I mean, if she didn't mind, it didn't matter. And she was clearly obsessed with this man that is older than her by 20 years. I definitely saw Remi take an interest in the professor that was very, very unusual. It was obvious she admires him. Everyone in class knew. But, as for me, I believe Jesus will intervene. Prof. N'Dyare actually gave preferential attention to Moremi. It was an open secret in the class that she was his pet student. Well, I wouldn't say that she was his pet. Look, she's the youngest in the class, but academically she's by far the smartest. I mean, that is bound to catch any lecturer's attention. At Goree Island they kept us waiting for ages while they went AWOL. When they did show up, it was odd. But I believe Jesus will intervene. Well, I was there, I was there when she approached the professor, trying to apologize for her trying to kiss him during their field trip. The professor has always been such a consummate professional, but she... she has always been on the man, like... tirelessly. No, no, no. It was actually the prof that was chasing after Moremi, especially during the field trip. Wherever Moremi went to, you'll see the professor running after her like, um... a lovesick puppy. It was blatant. Moremi never complained to me that he was harassing her. But after the Easter party, I sensed she was deeply troubled about something. She appeared quiet, withdrawn. Moremi did confess to me that, um... you know, she was going to... bed the professor before the end of the semester. That was her only way of guaranteeing that she had an interview for the UN. She was infatuated by this man, clearly. [Prof. Osagie] Miss Oluwa, regarding the first five chapters of your dissertation... what gave you the impression that Professor N'Dyare had approved it in the first place? He told me so. When? Where? In tutorial class? In his house. And... what on earth were you doing in your course supervisor's house, Miss Oluwa? He invited the whole class over on Easter Sunday, a public holiday, for a social gathering. Here comes the pizza. Please go ahead. It's for you. Don't be shy. But I wish she was here today, that would have been nice. Gloria, I mean, she is a pain in the ass. A little bit, sometimes. [Moremi] It was a fun, relaxed gathering, but something I ate didn't sit right with me, and I was in the bathroom for over 30 minutes, purging. -See you soon, okay? -All right, Prof. -See you in class, thank you so much. -My pleasure, thanks for coming. -Thank you very much, yeah. -Thank you so much, Prof. God bless you. -No, it was a pleasure. See you in class. Yes. -Thank you, sir. -Okay. -Prof. -Thanks for hosting us. Take care. Yes, indeed. Okay. It was a pleasure. Prof. -Thank you. See you soon. -Thanks for coming. Okay. -All right. -Bye-bye. See you in class. Okay, sir. [yawns] Moremi? [French] Where is everyone? They left. I thought you had gone, too. Something I ate. Maybe it was my Senegalese jollof rice. -Are you all right now? -Better. Thanks for a lovely evening. I should go. No problem. Please, can you at least help me clear up before you run off? -Okay. -Yeah? Thank you. I wasn't going to reveal it here and now, but I have approved the first five chapters of your thesis. You came up with some fascinating theories on conflict resolution in the Middle East. -Exceptional. -I don't know what to say. I'm pretty certain you're going to say thank you, when I tell you that I've also referred you to a high-ranking colleague at the UN. There will be an interview awaiting you in New York once you complete your postgraduate studies. Thank you so much! It's okay. Keep up the good work. I'm so sorry. It's okay. No problem. You look ravishing this evening. Thank you. Do you mind? Let me have your hand. Come on, come closer. What do you think you're doing? You know that I... -Stop pretending. -No! Why are you pretending? Please let me go! But you have been staring at me all evening. -No! -Teasing me with your eyes. -No! -See how you are dressed. You wore this to seduce me. You intentionally stayed back. No, I didn't. Stop the pretense! Be still! Stop it! You wore this dress to seduce me. Please don't hurt me! Can't you see that I care about you too much to harm you? -I promise to be gentle. -No! Then why were you staring at me? Stop it! Stop it! Stop this! Be still! You wore this dress to seduce me. No! Why are you pretending? Keep quiet! Okay. -Okay. -Be calm. -Okay. -Are we good? Yeah? All right, I will be gentle and slow. Miss Oluwa, are you implying that your course supervisor, a senior lecturer of this university, a professor of international repute, attempted to assault you? No, sir. I'm saying he attempted to rape me. Oh! Rape? Did you make an official complaint? -Not at the time, no. -And, um... why not? Because I treated his fuck-up! Miss Oluwa, I know tempers are rising, but you cannot speak with that kind of language. He's still your professor. My dear. [Lucien screams] It's not over yet! Professor N'Dyare? Well, part of her story is accurate. But the rest... is a complete figment of Miss Oluwa's fertile imagination. Yes, she did stay back after her colleagues had left. But it was she... who offered sex to me. It was I... who rejected it. There was never any offer of interview at the UN. Or any mention whatsoever of her dissertation. Obviously there is... never... ever... any attempted rape. Did you inform anyone she offered you sex? Of course I did. The following morning. To the dean of the postgraduate school present here, Professor Osagie. I can confirm that... Professor N'Dyare mentioned the incident to me. Now imagine this belonged to your sister... or daughter! Now, that wasn't a very smart stunt you pulled in there. The panel were never going to accept that exhibit into evidence. I had to do something. He sat there all week and told lie after lie to suit his bullshit narrative. All right, no problem. -You were very brave in there. -Brave? -Very good. -More like a brave fool. He's clever. Manipulative, credible. They believe him, not me. My own faculty dean, Professor Osagie, is giving me dirty looks. Look, calm down. The Ajike Advocacy is in this with you all the way. With all due respect, ma'am Ajike is just an organization using my situation to make a name for itself. Remi, that is uncalled for. I won't be a case study. This is my education, my reputation. My future is on the line right now! We're doing our very best here. But it's not making any difference. No wonder some students take matters into their own hands. Justice isn't blind here. It has 20/20 vision, all in favor of the faculty. I need to get into his head. Into his past. -That was a good tutorial. -Yeah, it was. -You know? -I know. Hey, that was some good lecture. Yeah, I feel like we're picking up a lot of stuff. True, exactly. Oh, man! I can do some swimming this afternoon. I think I'll join you. It's too hot. -It's way too hot. -It is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [French] Don't walk too near the edge of the cliff, in case the wind blows the wrong way and... stumbles you over. What was that? What are you doing? [French] Please excuse me. I'm looking for a lecturer who works here. His name is Cardosa. Cardosa? Sorry, no lecturer bearing that name here. Oh! I'm sure that was his name. He had it written on his lab coat. He must be a laboratory assistant. He can't be a lecturer, because they don't wear name labels. -Okay. -But they don't work weekends. [sighs] Thank you. [bell ringing] As you can see, I kept your old Peugeot for you. Really? You should have sold the jalopy. No, you used to love driving it. [laughs] Thanks for keeping my car. I don't want you to make fun of me. I don't know how to drive stick. Excuse me? What are you doing here, Moremi? I am looking for someone. Moremi, you know... I have followed reports of your hearing online. for the record, I believe Lucien is innocent... of the allegation you made against him. So you think I'm deliberately trying to ruin his career? I think you may... be a student who cannot accept the fact that... your best just wasn't good enough. I am trying to locate Mr. Cardosa. Cardosa? I've never heard of him. He's a laboratory assistant in the science faculty. That's not my area of expertise. But you have access to university records and contact details. Miss, what's this Cardosa got to do with your problem in Nigeria? That's what I need to find out. I am not going to conspire with you to bring down the career of a good tutor. You know... Lucien is a former student of mine. I've worked alongside him. I know the man. Lucien would never request sex in exchange for marks from a student. Never! Thanks for your time. I'll be staying overnight at the university guest house. Did Professor N'Dyare ever tell you how my close friendship with him started? I taught him how to drive a car... with a manual gear shift. Samba? [crowd chanting] [French] I am looking for Mr. Cardosa. [crowd cheering] [French] Mr. Cardosa? [crowd cheering] [French] Finally you are here. Please sit. [Moremi] He was right. It's more beautiful here. Not as beautiful as my country. You're not Senegalese? Lack of work made me relocate to Senegal many years ago. However, it was always my dream for my daughter to attend university in the country of my birth. Cape Verde. We struggled to get by. Had plenty mouths to feed on my lowly clerk salary. But Diatta was a shining beacon of light. Excuse me? No, no, no. Her. Lucien was her supervising lecturer. He saw the potential in her. Mentored her, guided her, secured her a scholarship. My family felt indebted to him. We considered him a blessing to our family. We prayed for him, thanked God for him. But, alas, he was a wolf in sheep's clothing. She was a poor girl from an impoverished family, but her education meant the world to her. She gave in to him time after time. But it was when she found herself with child that he displayed his brutally true colors. Diatta returned to Senegal a broken woman. No matter how much I assured her, she felt she had let us down, and shamed us. Three days after giving birth to her baby, having fed him, rocked him to sleep, put him to bed... she came to this very spot... and returned to her Maker. Lucien is a psychopath. Maybe growing up with an uncaring father made him turn that way. -Who knows? -No. He's just evil, manipulative, cunning. [laughter and indistinct chatter] Okay, see you, Remi. -See you too. -Take care. [Lucien] This is just impossible, I can't drive this car. Very manipulative indeed. Lucien visits his son sometimes... but for the most part he just sends money for his upkeep. He secured me a job at the university. Samba is his son, right? We were bribed... to keep our silence, to save his job and his family. I took the blood money to feed the rest of my family. I've regretted it ever since. [in English] When you came, I knew. There have been so many, but nobody wanted to speak up. I spoke up. I came here for your help, but you've suffered enough loss. Thank you. [in French] Thanks for your time. Goodbye. I think we've waited enough. We should go ahead. Ma'am, your client isn't here. I think we are going to have to go ahead. We've tried to wait. We've been considerate here. My apologies for my tardiness. Okay, this had better be good. Madam chair, our witness expresses himself better in French and Portuguese. -Portuguese? -I understand the language. -Oh, you do? -We are good to go Okay, fantastic. Please, have a seat. I'm sorry, but... why is he here? He is completely irrelevant to this hearing. We will be the judge of that, Professor N'Dyare. So please, sit down. Excuse me, young lady. I possess two Masters degrees... a highly published PhD thesis, and membership in 18 well-renowned academic fellowships. So now, I understand you are one of the panel here, but I strongly suggest that you adjust your tone when addressing me. And I am a Rhodes Scholar. I possess two PhD's, one Doctor of Letter, I belong to 23 academic fellowships across the world, and on top of that I was previously nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics. And as the chair of this panel, Professor N'Dyare, sit down! Sit! Thank you. Mr. Cardosa? Let's proceed. [Portuguese] I am Mr. Vicente Cardosa. I work as a laboratory assistant at the University in Dakar, Senegal, Cheikh Anta Diop. I am here to give testimony at this hearing, because I have been an acquaintance of Professor Lucien N'Dyare for many years. That was a breakthrough. It just might have helped. [French] I only wish I acted faster, like this young warrior here. Thank you so much. Continue fighting the good fight. You can make a difference. Safe trip. Thank you. How long do you think the panel will deliberate for? They will get in touch. We did good in there. Keep the faith. Somebody is looking for you. Thank you so much for your support, ma'am. -My pleasure. -Yeah. Miss Oluwa's... display of interest in Professor N'Dyare... did it go far beyond a student-lecturer relationship? In any way? No. I missed you. I missed you, too. Are you okay? [Prof. Lucien] And that goes to the crux of the economic diversification, of the role of the military in the Egyptian political system. That's a very good job, Kwesi. Now you can progress to chapters six and seven. Thanks very much, Prof. Now, Moremi Oluwa... I've gone through your first five chapters, and I must say that I'm rather disappointed. You made a complete departure from the approved premise. There is a distinct lack of citation, research, or any real analytical substance to your hypothesis. There's no structure at all. Your dissertation is an unmitigated disaster, far below what I expect from postgraduate work. But, sir... You need to get back to your premise, and remind yourself what you set out to explore. So now I'm taking out... your first five chapters, and I want you to start again. You're going to have to start all over again. From scratch. -That's it. -But, sir! Have a good day. Sir! Sir! Professor N'Dyare! [French] Why did you do that, sir? As I said in class, your work is below par. The other night, in your house, you called my work "exemplary." I've raised the standard since. If you raise the standard, it will be impossible for me to recover that kind of ground in time to graduate. I'll have to extend my course for an extra semester. And how is that my problem? This is all because I turned you down the other night. Don't flatter yourself. You tried to force yourself on me. It's your word against mine. And now... you intend to fail me. No. You failed yourself. But worry not, I believe in you. So I'll retain you next semester too. I will break you. Lucien! It's not over yet! It's okay. Let's go. You won't believe this. I got contacted by six women who studied in the universities of America, in the UK, in France, in Cape Verde. All universities where Professor N'Dyare taught. All six women claimed that they had been either sexually harassed or molested by Professor N'Dyare whilst he was their lecturer. -Oh, my God. -Now you see? You see why I had to make so much noise? Your story has given these women the courage to stand up and be counted. Is this good? Can it help? I'm so sorry. Not in this instance. But these testimonies establish a clear pattern of victimization. I know, but we are already at verdict. All we can hope for from these testimonies is that they will help us in the court of public opinion -if we should lose. -Lose? Jeez! I know. Okay, come on, let's go. Babe, are you good? Ma, I will wait right here for you. -Okay. -Yes, Ma. Babe, please stay solid for me, okay? -Okay. -It's just going to be fine. Come here. I love you. I'd like to welcome everyone to the final day of this panel hearing. But before we go on, I'd like very much to thank everyone for your part in the whole process. Especially the members of the panel. Uzoamaka, thank you very much for your hard work. And, uh, Professor Osagie, very grateful for your diligence and your dedication. Professor Yahaya, thank you very much for being such a great support. And Dr. Mrs. Nwosu, very appreciative of all the hard work that you put in. Our decision. In the complaint of Miss Moremi Oluwa versus Professor Lucien N'Dyare... the panel members of this university senate hearing have meticulously studied the facts, evidence, and witness accounts which has been presented by all parties. We also took the liberty of sending the first five chapters of Miss Oluwa's dissertation to an independent expert for consideration. Based on all the aforementioned, and our deliberations, we have reached our conclusions. We therefore conclude unanimously... that Professor N'Dyare... is guilty... of sexual harassment, abuse of power and privileges... unethical and immoral behavior unbecoming of a member of faculty of this great institution of higher learning. Professor N'Dyare's employment with the university is hereby terminated with immediate effect. As some of these offences fall within the framework of criminal activity, this complaint will be passed on to the office of the state prosecutor for further action. Miss Oluwa, you are hereby exonerated of any wrongdoing in this matter. -We did it. -We did it. -Yes! -We did it! Can we please complete our assignment. Thank you. I'd like to thank the members of the panel for your work once again. And I'd like to say that our work is done here. Thank you very much. We won! We won! Auntie... thank you. All right, let's go.
