I can't stay in a place with linoleum on the floor, dingy linens, - Oh come on. - Who cares? - Drapes that smell. - She's a princess. - Annie. - And a window that looks out on brick wall. I can't do it. - [Woman In Van] We're not gonna be there that long. - When I walk out on stage, I want to feel like I got it all. - Well you do got it all. What you won't go is any money left. - I'll skip some meals. See ya at the theater. - Alrighty, bye-bye. - Bye. - [Woman In Van] Bye Annie. [laughing] [speaking in a foreign language] - Mom, I already bought a warm coat. Okay then I love you. Let me talk to papa. Hey [speaking in a foreign language] did the shirt fit?

You think you can stand it, huh? Being here when I come home at night and just seeing how we work out together? - I can try. [laughing] - Oh baby, I'm never gonna run around on ya, never you hear me? You and me, 100%. Just a square deal, are you in? - 100%. [laughing] Has anyone ever lived here with you before? - What qualifies living? A couple a days, a week, two weeks, a month, or what? - Nevermind, I don't wanna know. - Listen all you have to now is it's you and me. Can you manage this? I'm due at work. - Oh. [laughing] - I'll see you later. - Andy. Suddenly I'm afraid of what you do and what could happen. - Hey I told you it's part of the life, a little rough on a relationship. So your mother wants you to get back to LA. Now's your chance. [orchestral music] You got the key? [keys jingling] See you tonight. [orchestral music] [laughing] - Hi ladies. It's my town. - Did you date 'em or arrest 'em? - They're my cousins. - Oh cousins. - But now you, you there is something very different about you. - Oh and what is that? Tell me what is different about me. - You're one lovely pain in the fern. [laughing] You're like a kid, you know? You're like some bright, beautiful butterfly. Hey, that was good stuff. Wait a second, where you going? - They're gorgeous. Which one do you like? - The gray one, let's go. - No, I kinda like the one with the big collar, you know with my hair up? - Hey enough with the coat, enough! I mean you're not getting it, so what's the difference how the collar is? - Oh relax, I was just looking. - You don't sound like you're looking. You've got the collar up, you've got it down. You ain't just looking. Come on. - I just said if. - I don't have the bread to get you that coat! - Well who the hell asked ya? I didn't ask you to buy the coat. - [Andy] Good! - Good. Good. - Can we go? - Yes, we can go. I was just telling you how I liked it that's all. What's wrong with that? It's my therapy. - Yeah well, I'm gonna need therapy. - One of these days I'm gonna have that coat if I want it. I'm gonna have that coat. - Yeah, then you won't be living with this jerk. I don't have that kind of bread. - I'll buy it! - Oh, you stinker. [laughing] [church bells ringing] You think you can do anything, can't you? If I say tap dance? [laughing] Oh baby, oh baby, it kills me I can't get everything for you. - I just love to live and dream. It's fun. - Not for me. - Come on, break your rule and come in with me. - No, no, no, I'll just sit here and wait for you. - I'll light a candle for ya. - Yeah light two, one for the coat. They got about the same odds. [police siren blaring] - [Ann] You know 'em? - [Andy] Yeah. Oh you're sweet, honey. - [Ann] Andy, if I put an act together, would you help me? You know just get a couple of songs, maybe put a couple of dance numbers in it. - Why what are you gonna do? You gonna get up on stage and shake your rear end in front of a bunch of strangers is that it? - Wait a minute, you saw me. You thought I was pretty good. - What do you think I can't take care of you or what? - No, no, no, that's not it at all. I was just thinking that if I worked, you wouldn't have to do two jobs. - When I make lieutenant, I won't do two jobs. I'll get us good things. - I'm not talking about things. I'm talking about helping you. - You miss working. That's it, isn't it? - Yes, yes I do. I love it, and I'm good at it. - See, it's what I said would happen. - Well wait a minute. Nothing has happened. Nothing has happened. There are shows right here in Chicago. - Let's stop being afraid you said. Am I making that up, or did you say it? - I said it, yes, I said it, but you're not listening. - Oh I'm listening, babe. I'm listening that's my problem. - No, your problem, sarge, is that you are stubborn. You put up a brick wall that a bulldozer couldn't get through. - Oh yeah, that's what you think. How long did it take you to get restless, huh? How long? What a couple of months? All right, babe, all right. You wanna go back to work, you go back to work. Only this jerk won't be sitting out front cheering. [police siren blaring] I want to talk to you. - [Ann] Sure. Your boots will be ready Thursday, and he thinks he can get the watermark out. - On no, just forget about the boots. - [Ann] Okay, I forgot about the boots. - Now we're gonna talk. - Baby, when people talk to each other, they also have to listen. - I listened, I listened. I heard you. You're not happy unless you're working. - Well I'm happy with you, and that's what counts. Work is just another part of me. - I'm not interested in parts. You miss it. Now that's what's happening, right? - Of course, I miss it. I don't wanna have to choose. You have your work. - My work, what are you talking about? I hate it! I hate my work! - That's all the more reason why I should help you. There're so many theaters here in Chicago, and you work nights. What are you doing with Variety? - I've circled this here. It's something to do with casting. - Did you get Variety for me? - Are you gonna read it or what? - Okay, okay, I'm reading. Okay, I need an agent. - So, there're agents in Chicago. - Yeah, but they don't know me. I've already tried. They're not interested. - Then forget 'em. Go to the theater yourself. - Andy, I can't go there without an appointment. - Who's in charge around here? - [Director] We're auditioning. - I know you're auditioning. Who's in charge? - The director. Energy people. - All right, who's the director? - Me, let's go. Is there a problem officer? - Have you heard of Ann Jillian? - No, I'm afraid I haven't. - You will. She's a singer. She's a dancer. Here's her credits. Now I want you to give her an audition. - We're looking for a blonde, blonde. - I can do that. - Who's your agent? - She doesn't have-- - He is. - Look if you're willing to wait and somebody doesn't show up, we'll give you an audition, okay? - Thank you. - That's the director? - Yeah. - Where I come from, only bums dress like that. He must be pretty good. - [PA Announcer] Attention please. Flight 71 to Newark is now departing from gate 13 D on the roof top. All passengers holding tickets for flight 71. - Mama? - My Juda. [laughing] - [Ann] Oh mama. - Oh it's been a longtime. You're in a show. - Let me introduce you to Andy. - Welcome to Chicago. - Well I've been thinking, Andy. You should have a vasectomy. - Mama, you just met the man. What are you doin'? - Well it's just five minutes in the doctor's office, snip, snip, and that's it. [laughing] - Mama, you can't say things like that. [laughing] - You think I'm joking. I'm not joking. It's enough. It's enough that you are living, you know like this! I mean to have children. I mean you're really stuck. - Mama, I'm not stuck. We love each other, and I'm working. Acting, not just musicals. - But it is in Chicago. It's not Hollywood, and that's where it counts. Maybe it's time that you got back and became a star. That's what you want? Now if you really love her, Andy, and you're going to stop her, are you? - [Ann] Mama, let me-- - I mean I only want the best for you. - I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. You want everything for me. I know, and I love you for it. I love you. But trust me and Andy, okay? - Eh, you're a good man. I can see that, but I don't know if I can forgive you for living with my Juda. You understand that, don't you? - Yeah, I understand that. - Well where do you want to go for dinner? - Hike! [yelling] - Tony! [yelling] - I got it! I got it! - [Andy] Charlie. [yelling] - I got it. I got it. - I got you. - I got it, I got it. - You got what? - I got the young female lead. - What, you knew you'd get that. - I know, yes, I mean, wait a minute. You're not listening. So I was at the audition, and the producers of Sugar Babies were there, and they heard me read, and they liked it. And now they want me for the young female lead in Sugar Babies. - Sugar Babies, what is Sugar Babies? - It's a national show. - That's great. - Wait a minute, you said national? - [Ann] Yeah. - Isn't that on tour. - Yeah, but only the major cities. You see first we rehearse in New York, and then we play San Francisco, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit, and then finally I make my Broadway debut. - [Andy's Friend] Good going, Ann. - Come on guys, let's go back to the game. - [Andy's Friend] Yeah, right. - What's this we business? I mean who made your deal? - No Andy, it's not a deal yet, Andy. I was just telling you about the tour. It's an offer. - It sounds like a long tour. - It's a year. - A year? Oh you're gonna be gone for a year? - Yeah, but it's a year that could change our lives. - Our deal was Chicago. - Wait a minute, it's your fault anyway. - What are you talking my fault? - Yeah, of course you don't you understand-- - What are you talking about? You go back on the deal, and you're telling me it's my fault? - Yes because I couldn't have done it without you. - Come on, big deal, what are you talking about? All you needed was a little confidence. - And a job, and you were my agent, and you got me a job. Yeah, an agent gets 10%. I want all of ya. - Wait a minute, ho, ho, wait a minute. You got it. I'm not going back on our deal. - When do you have to let them know? - They'll be calling within the hour. I've got some great numbers. Yeah, and what if they cut 'em? I mean that's happened to you once. Then you're stuck out on tour you know with a nothing part, and for what? - It's the road, isn't it? That's it, it's the road. Well then come with me. - Me, on the road? Hey how? I've got a 16 year pension. I'm up for lieutenant. - I was just trying. You try. Take the lead. - Do what? Carry your bags? Open the doors for ya? - Promote me, publicity, you're great at it, and you love doing it. - Oh, you are one crazy broad, you know that? - Then don't come, but get 'em to guarantee the songs. You can visit. [phone ringing] Get 'em to guarantee the songs. - Hold it, yeah I know who this is. I said hold it a minute. Okay but only if they guarantee the songs. All right, yeah go ahead, tell me. Uh huh. Hey, no way. No, no, no, hey this is not a great deal, pal. You're getting her cheap. - I don't care about the money. Yeah. So big deal, she'll be seen. Hey what if they cut one of her songs, what do they see then? Well that's great, all right, all right, fine. Yeah, then give us a guarantee that nothing gets cut. Hey that's not good enough. We need a guarantee. Hey we're gonna have to refuse the deal. Yeah, thanks. - [Street Kid] Yeah okay, I'm right behind you, man. - You should've seen her face. - Relax. What'd she say? - Nothing, she don't say nothing. You know her. She don't give ultimatums. - Excuse me. - Well she's got that other job. She'll get over it. - Maybe she won't. Hey, maybe I won't. I mean I don't want to kill anything inside her. But a whole year, anything could happen. I mean why would she wanna come back to me? - Yeah, it's pretty hard to figure. Maybe she actually loves ya. - I thought we'd turned it down. - Yeah, but you know I called 'em from the station house, and they said that the job was yours. - Oh my God. - Hey. [laughing] Whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't do this only for you. No, I did it for us. Come over here. Sit here. Here's the deal now. Truth of the matter is my job is just driving me wacko. I just want to get into something else. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna see if your career can make it better than mine. I'm gonna take all my pension money and put it on you, but if it doesn't work out, we're gonna have to be satisfied just working Chicago. I mean, okay? We have one year. - One year. - [Andy] Yeah. - That's only 12 months. - Usually. J, I, double L, I, A, N, yeah Jillian. Yeah, you're gonna love her. Two more performances. Yeah, well all right. I'll send you the press release then, huh? Thanks. Hiatus, what the heck's hiatus. - No filming and no casting. - Wonderful, then we're hung up. Well there's not much to do. - I know it's depressing. - How'd you like to do something nice? - Yeah. - How'd you like to be my wife? - Sarge, is that a proposal? - Well it sort of depends. How do you feel about that? - For me, our square deal was enough for the time being, but now you're asking me to get married. [laughing] [happy orchestral music] - Is that a yes or a no? [happy orchestral music] - Let's do it again. A church, my mother will be happy. [happy orchestral music] - Let's face it, babe, I think you're great, but nobody in LA came knocking any doors down, and New York is tougher. - Yeah but I've got great reviews, and I've got something to work with. - I mean this isn't a casting call. It's a convention. - Andy, go take a walk. - You shouldn't have to wait like this. Hey none of you should have to wait like this! - Shush. I want this interview. This is a very important woman. - Important? Yeah, if she's so important, what is she doing down here? - She goes where she has to to find talent. Now you have no idea what this woman means. - I'm Joy Selznick. Who are you? - I'm Ann Jillian. Pleasure to meet you. - Your credits fell off. Tell me about yourself. - Oh, I've got 'em right here. As you can see, I've got a lot of experience. - [Joy] I'd rather hear it from you. - I understand you're looking for talent. - Have you got it? - Yeah, I've got it. - [Joy] Prove it. - Come see my show. - How 'bout tonight? - It's this week's food money. Ah, let him have 'em. [orchestral music] Enjoy yourself. [orchestral music] Excuse me, I'm Andy Murcia, Ann Jillian's husband. Are you Joy Selznick? - I am. - Oh it's nice to meet you. Listen I'm sorry, I just let the tickets go. You know it got very late, and Ann's gonna be heartbroken. - I'm sorry I've been in this business long enough never to be late. - Listen I can get you in if you don't mind standing up. - No, it's okay. Tell me what do you do? - Well I'm a cop in Chicago. No, I mean I used to be a cop. 50,000? - All of us at the network decided that's what we wanted to do. Now who'll negotiate your contract? - Andy will. - [Joy] We'll find you a place in California. - Wait a minute, who said I can go to California? - You're her manager aren't you? - Yeah, but that's the big time. Those guys are pros. - Look she needs someone with her interests at heart, someone who cares for her who's not afraid. The rest I'll teach you. You're a very terrific lady, you know that? You'd do that for her, huh? - I'd do it for both of you. I think you've got a terrific future. [speaking in a foreign language] [whistling] - Hey Annie, hurry up. - [Ann] In a minute. - He's right for once. You gotta hurry up. You gotta take a shower and get ready. - Hey whitey, are you in show business or what? - Huh, g'day, g'day. - Yeah, g'day, g'day. Tell it to wardrobe. - Come on. - Come on! - They need water and care to start, but when they take hold, they grow very strong just like my Jura. [laughing] - You and mama stay here. I won't be too long. [ominous orchestral music] - It doesn't feel worrisome, but we need to check it out more. I want you to have a mammogram. You're 35 years old. You should have one for baseline purposes anyway, every woman should. - What about the x-rays? - It's a very small dose, and it gives us a lot of information. - Sounds okay to me. - Annie, then I want you to see a surgeon to see if he thinks that a biopsy is indicated. - Oh now wait a minute, that does not sound okay. - Get dressed. I'll make the appointment with the radiologist, and when you go, don't use talcum or deodorant. It can interfere with the test. - Anything you say doctor. - Something's there, and a biopsy's the only way to be absolutely sure, okay? - Okay. - I have to kidnap, ya. It's the only way we can get together. - Your timing is perfect. - I miss you, babe. What do you say you fire me, so I can go back to just being your husband? - [Ann] I hadn't notice you stopped. - [Andy] It's all work 24 hours a day. - Well don't knock it. We're on a roll. - How 'bout after Vegas, we take some time, promise? - Promise. - What's the matter, babe? - I love you. - We all agree the lump doesn't feel like cancer. - [Ann] Then why do you recommend a biopsy? - Well it's the only way to be sure. You can't tell just by examination or x-ray. - What if I waited a few months? - Don't. It'll only take a day as an outpatient. It'll be a very little scar. If you prefer to get a second opinion, feel free, but don't wait too long. If you were my sister, I'd give you the same advice. ♪ Until I left Chicago ♪ I never had the blues - Annie! Some nurse from a Dr. Edleman's office called to confirm an appointment you have that she made for you. You have an appointment at a hospital with a doctor I don't even know you've been seeing? - [Ann] It's nothing. - No, no, no, that is not nothing. - I have a little cyst, and I was thinking of having it removed. - What cyst, what are you talking about? What cyst, where? - Dr. Edleman thinks it's nothing, but he wanted me to have it removed because it's so easy. But you see we're so busy, and we're getting ready for Vegas that I thought I'd have another mammogram. - Mammogram, what are you talking about, mammogram? Where's the cyst? - In my breast. It's okay. The other doctor said it was okay to wait and then have another checkup. - [Andy] You sure? - Of course I'm sure. I wouldn't make that kind of decision on my own. - Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't want to worry you. - Well don't do that, huh! Don't decide what I worry about, okay?

[ominous orchestral music] - Hey! What's going on? - [Ann] I'm in the mood to cook. - No, no, no listen I booked us a table at that restaurant overlooking the water. There's a full moon tonight. Hey has it been a long time or what? Am I crazy? - I was sure we had some fresh basil, and you are crazy. - Yeah, I'm crazy all right. I'm crazy about you. [shattering] - [Ann] I'm sorry. - Ann, what the hell is that? - It's probably a gland. - Bull, that's no gland. I thought those doctors said you could wait. [dramatic orchestral music] - There was nothing in this breast before. It was fine. It was nothing. - Well it sure as hell is now. I'm gonna make an appointment for you tomorrow. - I already made it. - I'm going with you this time. - You can't. It should be by the last order of the day so that I'd have more time, but you've gotta pick up parents for our anniversary. - The hell with the anniversary. - If you don't, they're gonna know something's wrong. [dramatic orchestral music] - I don't think we can kid ourselves. I don't like the way this feels. - Is it because I waited? - No, there's been little change in the breast that we've been watching. This is new. I've never seen anything grow this fast. - What next? - Another mammography and a visit to Dr. Edelman. It's the weekend, and it's probably too late today, but my office will arrange for them to see you as soon as possible. - I can't believe this is happening. - Let Andy go with you for the x-rays and the examination. Annie, don't leave him outta this. - [Andy] What happened? - I have to wait till Monday. - Monday. - Is my brother here yet? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's upstairs with the folks. - You didn't tell him anything? - No, no, they're all here to celebrate. - Then we'll celebrate. I don't want 'em to worry. We'll wait to tell 'em until it's absolutely necessary. [clapping] - [Andy] Hope you like it. - Oh, I love it. Help me put it on. - All right, let's see. I don't know if I can do this. - Here I'll do it. - I'm glad you could make it, Ben. - Yeah, so am I. [glass tinkling] - As the second eldest person at this table, I'm entitled to give a little speech. - A short speech. - Yes, here, here. - Now mama, you can take as long as you want. - To Ann and to Andy. - Even though you're still not sure of me, huh? - Well as long as you're good to my Ann, I'm sure about you. [laughing] - To the both of you. - Thanks. [speaking in a foreign language] - Cheers. [speaking in a foreign language] - Now the other side. This may hurt just a little. [machine whirring] Hold your breath. - I think it's better you discuss this with Dr. Edelman. - What happened? What did he say? - I gotta see Dr. Edelman. - Why, what did he say? - Don't talk just walk with me. - I think we're looking at a cancer situation. - Get outta there, you say a thing like that. What are we gonna do now? What is this garbage? All of a sudden, you said she was fine, and now she's not fine? - Andy relax, it's not gonna help. - Are you sure? Are you 100% sure? - We'll wait for the biopsy for that. - And if my biopsy is positive, what are my options? - No, he's wrong. You're gonna be all right. We'll get another opinion. - In the past, we'd have the patient sign a release. Then if the biopsy was positive, we'd go ahead and remove the breast. Now we've learned that there's no evidence of risk in waiting and doing it separately. But since your case seems so certain, you may want to go ahead and do the whole thing all at once. - No, no, I don't wake up and not know whether I have breasts or not. Tell me now. Tell me now what my choices are and what my operation is gonna be. - We'll wait till we're sure. - No, I tried waiting. I've got a decision to make. What are my choices? - A modified radical mastectomy of the right breast, and we'd remove the lymph nodes. We could do a lumpectomy on the left and give you some radiation. That way you'd only lose part of that breast or a bilateral. - Do you ever make a mistake? Could this be a mistake? - It isn't likely. - What about a second opinion? - Well that's up to you. - Set up the biopsy. [dramatic orchestral music] Thank you, doctor. - I'll set up the time. Why don't the two of you relax here for awhile. There's no hurry. [dramatic orchestral music] - It's so beautiful out there. I look at all the activity and all the people out there, and it's hard to believe that anything bad could be happening. - Hey, we'll get another opinion. - I guess. [dramatic orchestral music] Oh, we've got the recording session. - Forget about it. I'll cancel it. - No, I don't want to miss that session. I've gotta get my mind off of this. I want to finish my day's work. ♪ Emotions, emotions ♪ They're much stronger than magical potions ♪ ♪ They make us behave as we do ♪ We may like it or not, but it's true ♪ ♪ Emotions, emotions ♪ When we smile or we frown ♪ That is why ♪ Some are good, some are bad ♪ Some are sweet, some are sad I'm sorry, guys.

The cancer hasn't spread from one breast to another. Your lungs are fine. Though for some lumpectomies are successful, in your case I would suggest a bilateral. You talk to your doctor about it. - First one, now two, I better get outta here while there's still something left. I wasn't looking for a second opinion. I was looking or a miracle. - Well good luck. - Thank you, doctor. - Yeah, thank you, thank you. [organ music] - Hey I'm not alone in this. One out of every 11 women, I've got a lot of company. I'm going for the bilateral. What do you think? - I want you to live. I mean that's what I think. - Then don't look at me like that. I'm not gonna walk off into the sunset, you know? - What do you want me to do? - I want to see life in your eyes not cancer. There's still so much living to do, and I won't stop that. I love you, and I love it all too much. - I don't know how to tell you what I'm feeling, and I'm trying to help. - I know you are. But you gotta help me not to cry 'cause I've still got my parents to tell. And you know how you always told me to take care of my health. Well I did. I took care of my health, but sometimes things happen. Luckily I listened to you, and I got a checkup. - Something is wrong then that's what you're trying to tell us. - Mama, let her tell it. [plucky folk music] [guests muttering] If it doesn't belong in you, you must get it out. You were put on this earth to live. That is what you must do. [plucky folk music] - She's gonna need someone, Andy. - [Andy] She's got someone. - I mean she's gonna need someone to take care of her afterwards. - I'll take care of her. That's what I do. - Oh Andy, I've known you now for what is it, seven years? - Eight, you still don't trust me to care for Ann, to look out for her? - Well you're a man. And you don't know how you're going to react. That's all I meant to say. [sad orchestral music] - It felt nice touching them. - Yeah. - You'll never be able to do that again. How do you feel about that? - They're the enemy. They're loaded pistols aimed at your heart. I want 'em off. Don't you understand? I can live without anything but you. [sad orchestral music] - What happened? I was so healthy. I always took care of my body, and now it's attacking me. [sad orchestral music] [crying] [orchestral music] Please don't let me leave him. [orchestral music] - [Andy] What are you checking out, babe? - [Ann] Checking out? - Yeah what's with the Easter card? - [Ann] I always get you an Easter card. - For all the things we never said, for all the things we never did. That's checkin' out. - I didn't mean it that way. But we've never talked about it before. Maybe we should. - I don't want to talk about it. I'm gonna do everything that's right. I'm gonna take care of your folks and everything like that. Just don't want to talk about it. - Okay, then we don't talk about it. - Hey, hey, nobody leaves the mob without I say so, huh? - Wait a minute, wait a minute, we're talking 11 days after a major surgery, and you're gonna comeback and do pratfalls? - I've already done all my difficult stuff and after the operation, I'm not in everyday anyway. - I'd be crazy to take the chance. No producer would let you. - Oh please Michael, don't replace me. I know I can do it. - Annie, here listen to me. I'm very fond of you, and it kills me, but this is a big budget show. There's a lot depending on this. - I know that, and I wouldn't ask you if I wasn't sure I could deliver. - I know how you can deliver, believe me. God, I'd have to reschedule the cast. There'll be other shows. Now you have your operation, rest, take care of yourself. That's very important. - Don't let me go to surgery without knowing whether I have work to come back to. Let me have that to hang on to. - [Michael] Does your doctor know about this? - He doesn't know how determined I can be. Please don't take away the part of me that I have to come back to, the productive part of me. Oh, thank you. - [Priest] The body of Christ. - [Ann's Mother] Amen. - [PA Announcer] Dr. Patrell, Dr. Janet Patrell, emergency admitting. - Remember all those beds on the road? - With every bone in my body.

I love you, sis. - [Ann] I love you too. It's okay. - [Andy] Father. - Hello Andy. - Thank you for coming. - [Ann] Hello father. - Hi Annie, how are you doing? - Scared. - Of course. You know we all love you, don't you? I thought you'd like communion. - [Ann] Thank you, father. - In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen. - Amen. - Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Happy are they who are called to his succor. - Lord, I'm not worthy to receive you. Savor the word and my soul shall be healed. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - The body of Christ. - Amen. - God bless you. - Thank you, father. - I'll stop by tomorrow. - I'll be here. - I'll be praying for you, both. - [Andy] Thank you. - Thank you, father. - Time to go to sleep. - Okay. - My little sugar baby. My sweetie. [orchestral music] Close your eyes. [orchestral music] Dream nice, my baby. [orchestral music] - [PA Announcer] Dr. Jackson, Dr. Jackson. - Hello baby, how are ya, kid? - Jura. - You're gonna be fine, you know that? - My Jura. - Huh, do you know you're gonna be fine? - Strong people. - I'll take care of everybody. You don't worry about anything, baby. Give me a smile. [organ music] - [PA Announcer] X-ray technician on hold, please call emergency. X-ray technician, call the emergency room. - I don't know how to do this thing. [organ music] I mean I don't know. [organ music] I'll make a deal with ya. You take care of her, and I'll keep coming to your house forever. [organ music] [machine beeping] It's all over, baby. Doctor said everything was good. You just take it easy, huh. Stay quite, just rest. [moaning] No, no, no, you don't talk, you hear me? I'll take care of everything. Do you need anything? You in pain? What can I do for you? Shush, don't talk. What can I get you? [machine beeping] - [Ann] What time is it? - About three a.m. - Franny, what are you doin' here? - I had a delivery, but the baby is taking it's time, so I thought I'd come see how you were doing. - Thanks. How's Andy? - Fine. It was a struggle, but I made him go home. [laughing] - Oh. - Shush, easy, easy don't move. You're all hooked up to drains. - It's weird. It feels like I still have-- - [Franny] Have breasts? - Yeah. - It's the bandages. - You stay with me for a bit? - Sure, they'll beep for me if they need me. - You know I thought it was all a dream, and I was okay. - You are okay.

[laughing] No more manager, agent stuff, out the window, gone. My new title, director of recreation. Whatever it takes to make my baby happy. Take her back to the room. All right guys, calm down. - You have the right to some privacy. - Mama, I can't hide. - Haven't you gone through enough? Having to answer questions to those newspaper people, television people. I mean stupid questions really! - What happened? - I threw 'em out on their ear. - [Ann's Mother] Good. - No, no, no I'm only kidding. I told 'em you were in here doing the fandango. You know I think maybe we oughta issue a release. - No, just ignore them, Andy. Just ignore them. - No, maybe we oughta find out how this is gonna affect my career right now. - You know I'll tell you something I wouldn't mind if it ended your career. - Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11-- - [Dr. Edelman] You're healing beautifully. - I exercise faithfully. - I've got some good news. The pathology came back. It's a primary cancer in each breast. There's no evidence of spreading. - Oh. - How's that feel? - Like I got a new birthday. [laughing] I'm due at work tomorrow. What happens if while I'm working, I pull up and I forget, will I tear anything? - You won't forget. The pain will remind you. Can you work like this? - Oh yeah, I can work like this. - That's a beautiful job. - If you do say so yourself. [laughing] - You're lucky. - Yeah. Forgive me if I don't look just now. [singing] What do you think? - Oh I think it's a good thing the part is supposed to be funny. - I'm nervous. Can you believe it? - Yeah, I can believe it. You know I meant it about us going away, letting me pull the wagon for us. - What's happening? Afraid I can't make it without breasts? - No, I'm just telling you I wouldn't mind if it did end your career that's all. We don't need this. - I need it. - Well you know how this business is. They think of you for sexy comedian type parts. - And cancer isn't sexy or funny so that wipes me out, right? - I just don't want you to be hurt or disappointed. I want you to have the best shot at life. Now eat this. Come on, will you eat this? You gotta keep up your strength. - You haven't seen strength! - All right I'll get dressed. You'll eat in the car. - [Ann] I'll drive myself then! - You can't even raise your arms. I'll drive. What happened to the toes? - Stuffed 'em up with cotton. How do they look? [laughing] - Well you're a good candidate for reconstruction. - Reconstruction? I haven't even seen myself yet. - When you do, think about it. Some people are more comfortable with a prosthesis, others with reconstruction. - I have thought about it, and reconstruction's not for me. - Well give yourself time. You might feel differently later. - No, I won't. I don't want to be put to sleep again. I don't want to be cut open again. No, I've made my choice. No. - That's understandable, and I'm not pressing for one or the other. The important thing is that you have choice. All women do today. There are some excellent reconstructive surgeons out there doing some very good work. It's my duty to make you aware of these choices. - Yes, and I believe passionately in those choices, and I've made mine. So I really appreciate what you're saying, but other women have to do what's right for them. - Okay. You can get dressed now. - No more bandages? I'm gonna feel naked without 'em. - I'll have to see you to advise what kind of prosthesis and bra. You see it's not just the breast. It's here and here. - Will I be able to walk out with 'em on? - Absolutely. - Good. They've got a little weight to them. - Only at first, you'll feel bigger because it's not you. So we make you a little smaller to compensate. You wouldn't believe what they used to give us. Come on, try these. - Okay. [bell ringing] Ta-da. [laughing] [whistling] What do you think? - Well you walk differently. - I know I walk tall again. They even bounce. Wait a minute, feel. Go ahead. - What is that? Is that a nipple? - What's the matter too sexy? [laughing] What do you think? [laughing] - I think I am proud to have you for my daughter. - So far as we can tell, you are cancer free. [laughing] - Thank you, thank you, thank you. - [Dr. Edelman] Thank you. - I love these hands. - But I want to discuss an option with you, preventive chemo therapy treatments. - Chemo therapy? - Why? You said she had no cancer. Come on, hasn't she gone through enough? - You said it hadn't spread. - Well it's an added protection, an insurance policy, and it might be helpful. It's your choice. - What about the side effects? - Well some people experience minor discomfort, others have major bouts of nausea and hair loss, but the hair grows back sometimes even healthier than before, but there's no way of telling what your reaction will be. The medication is cumulative. The side effects can be too. - Isn't there anything you can do to help her? - Well we include several medications to prevent nausea, but they don't always work for everybody. We can use an icecap to lesson or prevent the hair loss. Because it's preventive, if it gets too bad, we'll stop. We're concerned about the quality of life. - Look at me, I'm strong, I feel great. What I want to escape from are doctors and hospitals. - Yeah, but if there's something more we should be doing, then we should do it. It's insurance like he said. - I've got such an appetite to go on with my life. - You don't want to get caught holding the bag, do ya? - I don't want to lose my hair, okay? I don't want to lose my hair! - Right, terrific, all right, you want to die with a beautiful head of hair, terrific. [groaning] - Dry my hair please while I still have hair. - So you'll get a wig. - Yeah, look like a cue ball. - [Andy] Oh you like that? - Oh, I love that. Hey remember how I used to rub your neck when we were driving so you wouldn't fall asleep? - I remember your singing to me, your humming. You know letting your husband see you is one of the most important obstacles to overcome. - You've been reading up. - Oh yeah, I'm an expert now. - I'm sorry, sarge, I'm not ready. - That's okay. Hey you know it's okay. - My Joe has done a nice thing out here. - Hey, what are you doing here? I thought Ben took you guys home. - I thought I'd just stay for awhile just in case. - There's no in case. She's fine. - Andy, she needs more time. - I know. I miss her. I want to hold her that's all I mean. - [Ann's Mother] Of course. - I'm not just talking about the physical thing. I miss her. - She's trying to regain her life. - I know and you'd think with everything that she's been through she'd want to take it easy. You know let me handle everything. - Look my Ann you see with the cancer, she had no control, but performing she is in control. She's counting on herself only. It makes her feel that she's a whole person. - Well what about my love? I mean doesn't that make her feel like a whole person? - It is too frightening yet. - Doesn't she know there's nothing about her that I don't love? - But she may be afraid to put that to a test. - [Andy] What are you talking test? - Yes. - Women are crazy. - Maybe we're just frightened, Andy, of losing love. [orchestral music] - So are men. [orchestral music] - Andy honey, please set it up for me. - You want to do a cancer benefit now, huh? I thought we were gonna keep a low profile, so this could get to be old news and forgotten. - I can't forget it, but I can make it count for something. - Oh, why don't you just relax a minute? - I'll relax when I'm dead. I was given a second chance at life. - Life? This is life right here. Go and take a look outside. You and your pop, you planted all those roses. When are you gonna sit down and just enjoy them? - Can't you see that it's right? I'm young, and I'm visible. - And you're gonna identify yourself with cancer. - I'm identifying myself with hope. If I can make one person pay attention and save a life, doesn't that mean anything to you? - Of course it means something to me. I just don't want you to relive this thing just over and over again. - I do anyway, and so do you. - I don't know why I listen to you. I'm never gonna learn. - You're really something, you know that? - Is he in? Andy Murcia. Yeah, I'm a jerk is what I am. - You are not. - She's set. Yeah, I know what I said. She wants it. Yeah. - [Nurse] Is that cap too cold? - Just a little. - Well this'll warm you up. - Thanks a lot. - Hang on. Okay hold on. Here we go. [moaning] Here we go again. Hang on. - Oh. - And here comes your favorite. I know. Spit it out. Get it out. That's it. Get it all out. - It tastes like metal. - I know. [crying] - You better? Better, better? You got all that bad stuff outta you, huh? Pretty much baby. That's good. It's relaxing a little bit, huh? I'll go get you some baby food to put in your stomach. - Oh no, no food. I don't want any. - I know, I know, I know, just we have to get something in you so you can heave it up. Rest here, baby. Rest, rest. [groaning] [vomiting] [ominous orchestral music] - Oh God. Andy, help me! - Okay, oh my God. [siren blaring] - You weren't hemorrhaging. I'll check you for an ulcer, but my guess is it was tearing the lining of the esophagus. I think it may be time to end the treatment. Is that agreeable? [happy orchestral music] - Oh God. - You get some sleep, huh? I'll call everybody tomorrow and tell 'em you're sick. They'll understand. - I'll be all right. Just set the alarm. - I'm canceling the benefit. - Who will they get? - I don't care who they get. It won't be you. - I'll be fine. - I don't know where you're getting it from, babe. You're outdistancing me. [orchestral music] I know how you feel about giving things back when you got something, but I get steamed when it comes to you, I do. I'm selfish 'cause I don't want to put anything ahead of your being all right. All right, what's the verdict is it gonna work, or are we gonna have to go on another one of your shopping sprees? - I don't know yet. - [Andy] Let me see. - Stay out, don't look. - Let me help you. - I'll do it myself. - How? - I got into it, I'll get out of it. - Either you're gonna break your arms or rip the dress. Let me help you. - Andy, come on, I'll do it. - Come on. - [Ann] Andy, I'll do it. - Will you get your hands outta there? Turn around. Let me do it. Get outta there. [dramatic orchestral music] - Look I'm looking at ya, and so what? I still love you. [dramatic orchestral music] I ain't letting you go, and yeah I'm gonna take another look. You had a mastectomy, and I'm looking at it. And I see you, and I love you. And I'm gonna chase you around the bedroom for as long as I can move.
