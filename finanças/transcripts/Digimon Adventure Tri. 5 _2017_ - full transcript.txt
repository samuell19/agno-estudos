Now, release yourself, and destroy the world! Or your partner's gonna die 'cause of you. See? See? C'mon... You shouldn't have been born... You should have never been born... Mei-Chan! 1999 FALL TOTTORI PREFECTURE Mei-Chan... Mei-Chan! Mei... Mei-Chan! Mei!! I'm so glad! I was really worried. I was so scared. Mei! Let's get home. Taking Mei-Chan for a walk is okay, but don't go so far. I wanted to let her play somewhere with more room. Would Father get mad? Let's just keep it a secret for now. It's a secret. Mei-Chan too, shhhh. Shh. Meiko! What? Did you get hurt? No. Why? Isn't this blood? What? Then Mei-Chan?! Don't see anything here. Okay then. You're taking Mei-Chan to the research lab?! Yes. Early tomorrow morning, people from the Tokyo research institution are coming. It'll only be a day or two. Professor! The data! Get back! It's dangerous! C-Call the police! Hold on the police. Meiko, run! Me... I... Mei-Chan? Mei!! Mei-Chan. You should have never been born... However, I had been waiting for you to be born. That's interesting. Do you really think so? I don't think so. I only have a bad feeling about it. That's... Is that... ...our world? The Digimon are flying in. Mei-Chan...? Mei-Chan! Mei! You idiot! You wanna die? Meicoomon... The key to destroying the world... The key to destroying the world? That's what that Gennai-San called Meicoomon. "You should have never been born." That's what he said. There are no Digimon that shouldn't have been born! But, if Meicoomon shows up in our world with that much destructive power... This is lookin' bad too. It doesn't really look like they wanna be friends... No. 6 Multi-functional Satellite communication has failed! Is it an error? Confirm all checklists. Not only No. 6, but the IGS 1... Wait, the GPS signal has also shut off. All confirmable global satellites have shut off communication. It's not a problem with receiving? Confirm with Nobeyama! Contact Katsuura and Okinawa! It's breaking... The Digital World... The entire world... This time, I... ...will be chosen. Tapirmon... Hey. Where are you? We need to save the world. Tapirmon. The only ones who can save it are me and you... Only us who were chosen. I trust you, Tapirmon. I know you are my partner. There you are... Currently, due to the malfunction of weather satellites and seismometers, as well as false disaster alarms and warnings, certain regions are ordered to evacuate to avoid confusion. The Digimon spotted in parts of the world are seen as the same species. However, the sighting locations are not consistent, and many have begun to even predict the next appearances. I'd say maybe the Arc de Triomphe's next? Like, maybe they're touring the world? Yes, we're predicting among our friends where they're going to pop up next. Hey, what's this?! It won't eat or sleep! It's totally ticking me off! Humans... Such worthless creatures... They're an inferior existence... I am well aware that Himekawa's not present. But how come no information is reaching us?! Right now, the children are inside the Digital World... Hello?! Yagami... The Digimon sighted globally are not showing signs of movement at the moment. In certain nations, the police have put them under surveillance. No. 6 Multi-functional Satellite, error in attitude control! Hurry, check the system! No response! Reaction wheel, no response! This too? What's happening?! What are the Digimons' purpose? Individual nations have begun to hold emergency cabinet meetings. Taichi... Hikari... They'll be fine. I'm sure they'll be hungry when they return. I need to make a lot of food! The government is not declaring the situation an emergency as of now. However, they will keep a close eye on this... ...as they plan to discuss a response with specialists. What are they gonna discuss without calling Professor Mochizuki there? Professor, can they really state that this isn't a critical situation? Absolutely not. It's the calm before the storm. Just like before... Before? Meicoomon. In other words, it's a warning towards mankind... ...for being overdependent on digital power. A warning? From who? From mother nature or like as a sign from god? The Digimons who symbolize digital power are the warnings of mother nature? Isn't that a little funny? What about the connection with the recent giant Digimon incident? Meicoomon went out of control at the laboratory in Tottori once. At first, she was just afraid because my daughter wasn't nearby. Yet she was quiet while she held my daughter's stuffed doll. However, the next second, Meicoomon burst lava like a volcano. What on earth is Meicoomon? Is it really a Digimon? It is a Digimon. However... It's an existence that holds too much power. Hackmon! Hackmon? A self-proclaimed messenger of Homeostasis. Homeostasis is trying to protect Meicoomon. Homeostasis only protects the harmony of the entire world. Well, don't you need Meicoomon for that? Libra has been an unstable one since its birth. Libra...? That's Meicoomon. Libra holds a shard of Apocalymon's data within it. In other words, it contains a dark side of the Digital World. A tremendous amount of power lies within it. It was outcast because of how much power it held... No, it was feared to be correct. The existence of a partner was what maintained the balance of Libra's power. You mean Meiko Mochizuki? Correct. That is true. Meicoomon was very calm when she was with my daughter. Meicoomon would never leave her side. When my daughter left for school or wasn't home, she was very lonely... The existence of a partner had been our hope. However... ...when suppressed power breaks loose, it bursts out with unimaginable force. Once its instinctive-type power bursts out, there is no meaning in having a partner at that point. Libra's powers are now massive... It is a threat that could destroy all harmony and stability. A threat, huh...? So my daughter... she... ...carries an oversized burden on her shoulders for a DigiDestined. Yeow! Jeez, what's up with all this? It became a slope all of a sudden! The ground became a swamp earlier too! With this, we don't have a clue where or how to run! Meicoomon's existence may be causing something that goes beyond a reboot. Which means we got to stop Meicoomon? Yamato, run while we stop them! Hurry! What is all this?! Thank you, Biyomon. Hikari! Ouch! Are you alright? Thank you! Takeru! Thank you, Patamon! Hikari, are you hurt? No. Biyomon, thank you. Oh... Thank you... This way! Huh? There's no ground?! It... doesn't hurt? Hurry, get off... Sorry! For now, it seems like nothing's coming after us. What's going on? I remember when we first came here, we were attacked by Kuwagamon... But we were never attacked by the forest plants before. They detest us... What? The Digital World... ...detests us. They think we're a nuisance. What do you mean the Digital World thinks we're a nuisance? Is there really nothing left that the partner can do? Isn't there still hope? There is no time. The judgment has been made. It suddenly became night when it was bright just minutes ago. I wonder if this's really night? Ugh, if we weren't in this situation, they'd look pretty like shooting stars. If they were shooting stars, I'd wish for them to take us home. We've got to get back somehow. We got to stop Meicoomon. Koshiro, isn't there a way to find the distortions and get home? I've been trying to locate the distortions this whole time... ...but it's no use. I... ...couldn't stop Mei-Chan. It's not your fault, Meimei! I am Mei-chan's partner. But... I couldn't... Just being a partner doesn't mean everything will go smoothly. That's normal. Having just one listen to the other isn't what it means to be a partner. Yeah, that's true. I mean... we've both got a lot of faults. But that's what kinda balances us out. Isn't that why we're partners? I've been observing everyone's bonds with their partners. Each connection is different... ...but a strong tie is always there. I wonder Mei-Chan and I have that? That's why you came all this way to see her, right? So you don't run from the fact that you're her partner. No matter what happens. But... Mei-Chan transformed, because I came... What? What do you mean? I'm sure it's because of me. What was I chosen for? I can't do anything. Moreover... Mei-chan's... Meimei... I'm scared. If I can't do anything, why was I even chosen? There should've been someone more worthy chosen. It's all because I was chosen. That's what caused all of this! Now don't say that. We became friends because you were chosen, right? That's why we're all together here, right? Don't close yourself off. When people become lonely, a thorn grows in their heart. I was also like that. Don't worry. I'm positive your heart will reach Meicoomon. I'm sure the things you really want to express will get across to her. You two are partners. My strong message... Mei, Dan Dan. Please trust your partner. And also yourself, who was chosen as her partner. Don't give in to a weak heart. We shouldn't be that weak. No. Even if you are weak, we, your friends, will always be at your side. There must be a reason why you and all of us were chosen. A helpless, chosen kid like me who's afraid of her partner? Not a "chosen kid." We're the "chosen kids." Please don't carry it all on your shoulders. Share it with us. What are you sharing?! I want some too! Just sleep! Huh? Agumon... Jeez, you... There's nothing? Then, good night! Give me a break, I don't want everyone to think we're all the same as him. But with this incident with Meicoomon, the Digimons are going to be criticized again. Agumon and everyone all fought to protect us here. So we've got to protect them too. Same goes for Meicoomon! Whatever happens in front of you, don't run. Let's face it together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Meicoomon is your important partner no matter what she looks like. She's waiting for your help, Meiko-San. For my help? Let's go save Meicoomon! Homeostasis has taken the situation seriously and decided on Libra's removal. Removal... Is that, in other words, to eliminate Meicoomon? Since not even the reboot could suppress it, the only option is to destroy it ourselves. Goodness... Libra has gone through a kind of mutation due to its protective instinct. Mutation? It's not an evolution? There is no evolution that advances nothing and only brings destruction. If it is not removed now, we cannot imagine what it could change into in the future. Wait a sec! We've been working hard to protect Meicoomon all this time. But now that it goes out of control, you want to remove... Yes? What? Is that true? But... I understand. What has happened? The Self-Defense Forces... ...are preparing to be dispatched. They are going to be supporting us. We have already spoken with the government. Why didn't you notify me before now?! What could you do even if you did know? Are you just going to watch as the world is about to meet its end again? We desire the harmony of all. Harmony exists only if it is sustained. As long as its existence destroys that, we cannot overlook it. It shall be removed as a contaminant. All by the orders from above. Then what's the point of Yagami and everyone? Yes. If you're just gonna cut them off... ...why did you choose them?! This plant uses volcanic geothermal energy. The locals worry that it may induce volcanic activity nearby. With the destruction of the suddenly appearing Digimons, the damages could spread to nearby villages. Certain governments have decided to dispatch their militaries. The Digimon that disappeared after destroying the plant is being sought. We are now under the threat of the malfunctions of digital devices... ...as well as the fear of natural disasters. What are these Digimons trying to do with our world?! Contaminant... It was sunny just a second ago. They say a woman's heart and the Digital World's weather are both fickle. You sure know difficult sayings. Hikari-Chan. You said that the Digital World detests us earlier, right? "Get out." What? I feel like the Digital World is saying that to us. The skies, the land, or even the air... None of it's accepting us. That's not true. At least we don't detest you guys! Yup, I want to be with you guys forever. That's right. I love Mimi and everyone! Palmon, I love you too! You're right. Well, looking at this situation, I can understand how you feel like this world is attacking us. It's probably trying to get rid of its contaminant. Contaminant? We may be seen as a virus to the current Digital World. A virus? How rude! The current Digital World? You mean that it was different before? Is the reboot the cause? I don't know. But I feel that something is changing from the Digital World that we know. We are... ...going to be disposed of by the Digital World. We are a nuisance. Why? Why are we a nuisance?! Maybe it's because we're the DigiDestined? It stopped raining! Huh? Isn't this... ...where we first came to the Digital World and met Agumon? See with your own eyes. And... ...meet your demise together. Is this...? We came back? Seriously? How lucky! Taichi, where are we? Where are we? Oh, this is... Our... Is this your world? Hey, that's a Digimon! Why's she crying? We didn't do a thing. Maybe because it's a child? A protective instinct probably. Protective? Do we look that dangerous? Aw, how shocking! Don't worry, Palmon always looks cute. Much obliged! Then let's just become friends with them. I agree! You guys there, what's the matter? Are you okay? We're fine, we were just messing around. Could those be Digimons...? Quick! Huh? Hey! Wait right there, you kids! I've found some suspicious children carrying Digimons. I need backup. The location's... I'm so sick of running! It's not a matter of being sick of it! Taichi, it's because you ran all of a sudden! We kinda ran after him too. We must look 100 percent suspicious now! Well, we can't help it now! We're already running! U-Um...! I can run on my own! Oh, my bad. Officer, over here! There they are! Biyomon, run! I can't leave you! What'll we do? Koshiro, hide Agumon and the others! Hide? Wouldn't your laptop work in this world? Oh! Wait, don't do anything! But at this rate... We shouldn't make a scene. It's open! Hop in! What's this? Just get in! Hurry! What about you guys? We'll be fine, so hurry! This is definitely going to affect my school record. You're worried about college at a time like this? Of course, since we're back. In a sense, Joe-san's ability to adapt is impressive. What happened to the Digimons that were with you? The police officers witnessed that all of you were with Digimons too. We were just with our friends. Friends? Is it wrong to be with our friends?! Digimons are a highly dangerous species right now. They aren't dangerous! That's right! They're really good Digimons! Don't you know what the world is going through right now, because of these Digimons?! What the world's...? What do you mean? Excuse me, there's someone here to claim custody of the children. "DAIGO NISHIJIMA GRADE 2 MANAGEMENT OFFICER" Why does a government bureau want these children? Because they are important children. We can't just easily hand them over like that. These children ran away with Digimons and hid them somewhere. They were instinctively trying to protect their friends from the police. Friends? Those children were saying the same thing, but an adult like you calling Digimons "friends" is ridiculous. I represent... ...the Incorporated Administrative Agency, National Data Processing Bureau, Information Strategy Section, Information Management Office. You trying to pressure me? Whatever you'd like to call it. But the children will be handed over to us. Those children are clearly hiding Digimons. They must be watched closely. The one to decide that is not you. I know you guys are tired and I'd like to take you home... ...but your homes are surrounded by the media. The media?! Looks like some info was leaked. Then we can't go home? Don't worry, you will. But not now. For now, I'll be taking custody over you guys. I have your parents' consents. What on earth is going on? It's Meicoomon. Mei-Chan? That's Meicoomon in the picture, right? Yes. What has she done? I'll tell you when we arrive. Are we heading to that whatever-bureau? No, somewhere more relaxed. It's summer break and everyone's gone, so it's under the media's radar. Ah, school! The fire is still strongly continuing after five hours have already passed. Mei-Chan did this? It's the same as with Kuwagamon. It's worse than that. There was this much damage with only Meicoomon causing one explosion. Imagine if all of these Digimons went out of control... The Earth... ...will face an unprecedented crisis. So basically... ...we've got a knife to our throats. We've got to stop it! Let's chase them away! Calm down. Taichi? If we just randomly fight, it'll be the same as Odaiba. So are we just gonna sit here and watch?! The world is in danger! I wanna jump out there myself. But just like you said... ...the battle from here on is gonna involve the fate of the entire world. And that's why we can't let the same thing happen again. For Agumon and everyone too. I know that, of course. Jeez! Meicoomon's sure done it this time! Joe-San! Agh! No, um... But... ...where did Meicoomon end up going? She may have already been removed. Removed? What do you mean, Mr. Nishijima? Homeostasis ordered Meicoomon's removal? An existence undesired by all. An existence that shouldn't have been born... Then I as well... I'm an undesired partner. Stop it, Meiko-San! Don't put yourself down! Same with Meicoomon too. Is this... ...something a desired person would do? And I couldn't stop it. Right now, there's someone who desires you the most. Meicoomon. Yeah. I think we and our partners are each other's hope. That's right, Meimei! You, no, we are Meicoomon's hope! We'll find hope for sure! Hope... That's true... yeah. There's something bothering me. Why was Meicoomon even targeted at all? These Digimons appeared after Meicoomon showed up. A switch to turn on the other Digimons... In theory... ...what if that was Meicoomon? That's the whole reason Meicoomon was targeted? The destruction of the present world... An existence that wants to exterminate mankind... Isn't that...? Yggdrasil. Then it may have been Yggdrasil's will to remove us from the Digital World too. What the heck is Homeostasis doing? So that's why! That's why it wants to remove Meicoomon? Taichi. What's up? I'm hungry! You never change wherever you go. Wherever I am, I get hungry!! Agreed! What should we do about dinner? I'll go buy something. Can you grab the unimayo flavor? Me too! You're still gonna eat? Of course! It's so quiet. Yeah, I can't believe the world is in great danger right now. Isn't it scary? Scary? We can never understand how serious a matter is... ...unless it actually occurs around us. Huh? What?! Since we're all gathered here, a summer's night at school would call for this, right? What? What? What's going on? Scary stories? Yup! So stupid. Cut it out. Yamato's surprisingly bad at these types of stories in the dark. I-I'm just saying this isn't the time to be doing that kinda stuff. Hey, what are you all whispering about! I'm not afraid of some ghosts, okay?! You guys too! Stop whispering!! I was all alone in the classroom... ...and no else was there. There I saw the results of our practice exams... It was an utterly terrifying score!! Oh, jeez! Back to that?! Why make it a joke? What do I say? You said to share a scary story, so I told you my own bone-chilling experience! That's completely based on your own personal fears. Well, yeah! It's more realistic that way, right? It isn't the least bit scary. It's not even funny as a joke. So my scores here are terrible as well. Then next is me? This is the story about my friend... A start like that sounds super fake already! Like telling us we'll be scared. Aw, come on! What about Meiko? Huh? Do you know any scary stories? Oh, I wanna listen! Are there any stories from Tottori? I-I'm not very familiar with those types of stories. Or any stories of your own, Meiko. My own stories? I'm not exactly very good... You don't need to be good. That's right! Yeah. Um... Then, uh... This was when I was in elementary school... Oh, it sounds realistic. But there was a street that usually had streetlights lit. Just on that day, none of them were lit... I usually took that street home, so I didn't think anything of it as I walked on. Then I heard a bicycle bell ring behind me. And someone on a bike rode past me. But I only heard its sound... And then... W-Wait, is this going to continue? Yes, this is where it got strange. So I was looking ahead of me, but this time I hear that bicycle bell right behind me. And that bike stopped right there. When I turned around... What's going on? Why're the lights off? Mr. Nishijima? Well, I thought I should take you all to the hotel soon. A hotel? We can't go back home? The media still seems to be there. We've got a hotel for tonight. We're fine here. At school? What? I wanna shower though! Just use the clubroom's showers. Hmm... Then okay! The stories are just getting good too! Nothing's getting good! If you're scared, you can go to the hotel if you want. Don't be stupid! Hey, you guys! Stop whispering! Mr. Nishijima, is it okay? What? Umm... Hey, hey, I haven't said anything yet! Then you wanna go to the hotel alone? I'll stay... Fine, but make sure to call home. Oh yeah, we haven't called yet. It slipped our minds. They must be worried. I'm sorry I scared everyone. Yeah. Yeah. I'll put Taichi on. Hello? Is Agu-Chan and everyone okay? You're more worried about them? I'm sure you're okay. Well, yeah, but... Take care of Hikari, Agu-Chan, and Gato-Chan, okay? Okay. Bye. Taichi. Hasn't it been a while? What? Since your summer's been this lively? What are you talking about? Good night. Lively? Taichi? I'm gonna get some fresh air. Yes, you don't need to ask me if I'm okay that many times. Everyone's all with me. I'm sorry about Mei-Chan. My thoughts...? I don't know... yeah... Thank you. Good night. "FATHER" I'm not okay at all... Mei-Chan... what do ya want me to do? I heard what he said. That you shouldn't have been born. Is that true? Is that why ya trouble everyone? Why you're going crazy? I love ya, Mei-Chan. But just that... Reckon just having fun together maybe wasn't okay? What are me and Mei-chan's hope? If I'm your hope... ...why am I in such knots? No one would ever suspect it... Taichi-San. Oh, I didn't mean to overhear what you were saying... Was that in Tottori dialect? It's kinda fresh to hear. Sorry. Ya sure are a top bloke. What? Oh, I mean that you're a good person. Oh... thanks. Um... I wonder what they're talking about. Should I report it to Hikari? Should I tell Sora about it? I should tell Yamato, right? Why does everyone have to report this? It's not really needed. Hey, um... You know they always say, there are things you can see when you're young, but can't see when you grow up. In reverse, there are things you see as an adult that you never noticed as a child. But I can't tell what it is you're supposed to see and what you're not. Is there that much of a difference between what kids and adults see? When I met Agumon after a really long time, I realized I had always been connected with him. I thought that naturally. Because you're partners? "You shouldn't have been born." If you say that Meicoomon... I think he said that to me. If I were never here, I wouldn't have been her partner. And Mei-Chan would've never... Mochizuki!! My bad. But... ...that's not right. He got mad at me. Are you okay? Agumon. Why did you send Agumon? Taichi's partner should be the one to make up for Taichi. Is it really okay with just Agumon? I'm extremely worried. Meiko. Are you hungry? Huh? He's useless. No, I'm really full. But... But? Here's probably not. Your chest isn't full? What the heck is he saying? That line's a problem. You're funny, Agumon. I envy Taichi-San. Not only Taichi-San. Sora-San and Hikari-San. Mimi-San... everyone. Meiko. Oh, sorry for scaring everyone earlier. I wasn't scared at all. Hey, Meiko. I like Mei-Chan a lot! Meiko too, right? Mei-Chan probably likes you a lot too. Is that okay? Is that okay? Should I tell Taichi? Why? Should I tell Sora about it? What about Yamato? Joe's okay, right? I should at least tell Hikari. Like I said, why?? Taichi. I yelled at her. Who? A girl. I was watching. Seriously? Everyone said they got to report it. To who? I dunno. Not that I care... Why did you yell at her? I don't know. Were you hungry? No. Hikari was saying earlier... ...that if it doesn't occur around us, we can't understand. In the end I wonder if it's even possible to share the same feelings. Since when did I start to worry so much? But I'm not able to do anything about it. If I could've just stayed as a kid. If I grew up staying that way. I could've... Well, when I'm hungry, I always eat something. Taichi, you should just do exactly what you want to do. Yeah. It's Meicoomon! Stop, Meicoomon! Mei-Chan! You became that way because of me, right? Because you tried to protect me... Then blame me! Blame me for not being a worthy partner! I'll take all of it! Meiko-San... Or... ...am I not your partner anymore? I can't become... ...your hope? That's... ...the same thing surrounding her from the plant explosion. Agumon! Okay! Wait a second! What if everyone gets infected again by getting in contact with Meicoomon?! No way! We got to go! Yeah. Gabumon. Taichi! Evolution! Greymon! Birdramon! Kabuterimon! Angemon! Togemon! Garurumon! Ikkakumon! Super evolution! MetalGreymon! WereGarurumon! MagnaAngemon! Garudamon! Zudomon! MegaKabuterimon! Lilymon! Angewomon! We leave it to you, MetalGreymon! Everyone! Mei... Mei-Chan... ...is crying. What? Yeah. She's scared. Zudomon! The distortion surrounding Meicoomon is increasing. Is fear increasing Meicoomon's powers? Why? Why does it turn out like this when we just want to save Meicoomon! I need to save... It's here. What is that? A Digimon that Homeostasis has sent in. Homeostasis...? Jesmon! There it goes! You shoulda known better. Thanks, Homeostasis. How interesting! What is that power? Just her existing is destroying everything. Mei-Chan! Why?! Didn't Homeostasis tell us to take care of Meicoomon?! So once we're no use, it's just gonna cut us off and finish Meicoomon itself? I thought that it was Yggdrasil's will... ...that was trying to remove us from the Digital World. But maybe it was Homeostasis' will? Who is our real enemy? Who... ...are we really fighting against?! Run! Meiko-San?! Did Meicoomon... Protect Meimei... Just now? Wasn't she just attacking Jesmon? No. She protected her. That's right! I'm sure! If Meicoomon really protected Mochizuki-San... We got to save her! Taichi! The Omegamon! I know! MetalGreymon, lure Meicoomon to the ocean somehow! MetalGreymon ultimate evolution! WarGreymon! We shall follow too! Ultimate evolution! MetalGarurumon! Phoenixmon! Seraphimon! HerculesKabuterimon! Vikemon! Rosemon! To the ocean! Halt, DigiDestined. Hikari? Stop these foolish actions. Homeostasis... What do you mean "foolish actions"?! Anything to obstruct harmony and stability shall be removed... Is that why you're gonna get rid of Meicoomon? We won't let that happen! We are just doing what you could not do. If all of you get in the way, you will be removed as well. Don't you dare! These children as well as their partners are not your pawns! Your actions right now obstruct harmony. We just want to protect our friends! Friends... That one has become too strong. Are you saying that you can do anything for harmony?! Sacrifices are necessary. It's not that simple! Don't you dare say that! Huh? Get out! Hikari-Chan? Get out of me this instant! There should never be any sacrifices! Ever! Our friend is suffering! And with your selfish reasons you want to... I won't let you! At this point, you cannot do anything. Leave such feelings of teamwork aside which obstruct the bigger picture. Mei-Chan! Mochizuki! Our friends... What's wrong with caring for our friends! What's wrong with it! The distortion's closing! I'm gonna protect them! Yamato! Yeah! Celestial Arrow! Do you hear me? Homeostasis! We don't care if it's right or wrong! We will... ...protect our important friends! That's all! Alphamon?! Yggdrasil? Seraphimon! Tapirmon, please come. Don't come near me! The only one allowed is... ...just Tapirmon! How come? Why won't you come, Tapirmon? Let's save the world... I... In the end, I was never able to save you. Why... Why on earth were we chosen...? Zero distinction?! Meicoomon! Don't make Meiko-San suffer anymore! Please! Mei. Please... ...kill Mei-Chan. Meiko-San! Meimei! What are you saying?! I can't... Any longer... I told you, partners are each other's hope! But you're only giving off despair! Then... ...are you saying that killing Meicoomon is your answer of hope, Meiko-Chan? No way... That's too sad! I love ya, Mei-Chan. Okay. Taichi?! Taichi! Omegamon! Stop! That's the only way to stop Meicoomon! Wait! It's true Meicoomon is the cause of everything. Joe Senpai?! But Meicoomon is her partner, you know?! Her one and only! Taichi. You're gonna put all the responsibility on Meicoomon... ...and put an end to everything?! Yeah, I'm gonna end it. With our hands. We can't let them have their way. Meicoomon is one of us. I... ...won't run from our friend's pain! We are the DigiDestined! Omegamon! Y-You idiot! Mei-Chan... It's okay now. I'm sorry... Mochizuki-San... Are you kidding me?! Hope doesn't include sacrificing our friends! Taichi! Please stop already! You should already know too, Yamato-San! Yamato... Thank you. Meiko-San...? Wait! You idiot! Yamato! Don't! Mr. Nishijima! Stay here! Mei-Chan! Mochizuki! Let go! Let go of me! Un Pour Tous! Yamato! Taichi! Omegamon! Taichi-San! Taichi... Yagami! Taichi... Taichi...? Hikari! Taichi... Hikari! Taichi... Why...? I... ...need to be at Taichi's side. Hikari! Hikari-Chan? What's wrong with her? That's... Taichi... Stupid... Hikari. I... I... What should I do...? Meicoomon... The more one is honest and delicate, the more fragile and easily broken they are. Hikari-Chan! Get a hold of yourself! Take over... Take over...! Why? Destroy all... Disappear... All of it disappear... What is happening? The harmony has started to collapse. If this is just as Yggdrasil planned, our world... ...will be swallowed by the Digital World. Our friends... What's wrong with caring for our friends! You idiot... Everyone, stand up! Yamato... What is sitting gonna do? What is yelling gonna do? We can't save anything! Then let's stand up! Don't stop! We can cry later! Taichi... Where's Taichi? Taichi!! Stop, Koromon! I... ...need to protect Taichi. I need to, but... Meiko, I... Taichi... I'm sorry... Don't apologize. This was his own decision. Yamato... Let's go. Even if time lets go one day. Only we two know our secret words of love. Only we two know our secret words of love. Those carefree days when we slept soundly. Under the shades of the trees we drifted off. We both always shared the same dream. Reflecting it in each other's eyes. You being there You being here. Us being here together. Small miracles. These will never change I believe. Now. Now and forever. Even if time lets go one day. We two are connected by our secret words of love. Even if destiny looks away. Only we two know our secret words of love
