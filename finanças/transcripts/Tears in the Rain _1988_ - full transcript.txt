(heavy rain pours down) (birds chirp) (light orchestral music) (heralding trumpet music) - Hey! How did you-- (woman screams) Welcome to Bredon Hall. - Please let me up. - But you know we're not open to the public. - I'm sorry, I was just-- - We can't have just anyone dropping in. - Let go of me, ya big gorilla! - Ah, an American! I might've guessed. (laughs) - And you, I take it, are supposed to be an English gentleman! - Don't count on it. - Get off me! - You are trespassing! - For Pete's sake, what harm have I done? I just-- - Well how 'bout criminal damage to my peace of mind? - If you hadn't yelled at me I wouldn't have fallen - You invaded my privacy! off the wall to begin with! - You deserve to be yelled at! - You arrogant, overbearing, son of a-- - You know, women have sometimes fallen for me, but none so dramatically. (laughs) That's better. I'm Michael Bredon. - Michael Bredon. - And you are? - Still lying on damp ground. (breathes heavily) - Hello. - Hi. - Well? - Well? Do you suppose you could open the gate for me? - You mean you want to walk out? How very conventional. (gate rattles) - Thanks very much, I can find my own way back now. - Where's your car? - In America. - (chuckles) How did you get here? - I walked. - From where? Is this what you're looking for? - Sure is! - I think I'm entitled to an explanation, Miss...? - Miss, uh-- - Eh! What were you doing on my wall? Any particular reason? - Hey! (tires squeak) Just put me down as a nosy American tourist! Can I have a lift? Not a play thing for an aristocratic bully. (car accelerates) (light classical music) Thank you, very much. (light classical music) - [Voiceover] My dearest daughter, one last request. Try to deliver this letter for me. If Lord Bredon is still alive, put it into his own hands. Be sure you give it to nobody else. And if he, too, is dead, destroy it. All your life, you've been such a friend and comfort to me. Bless you, my baby. I know you'll do this last thing for me if you can. Your loving mom. (somber classical music) (knock at the door) (knock at the door) (knock at the door) (key ring jingles) - [American Woman] Oh, no you don't. - Don't what? Invite you to dinner? Surely cat burgling makes a girl hungry. - And how did you find me? - Miss Casey Cantrell, this is hardly London. So, Annie tells me you're from Kentucky. - Oh, she does, does she? I bet she just gives you full run of the place. - Oh, it's a small, friendly world if you live out here. - Downright feudal one if you ask me. - Oh please, allow me. - Mr. Bredon. - Michael. - Please let me pass. - Michael. - Michael, thank you. (giggles) - After all, we're hardly strangers. Only a couple of hours ago we were in each other's arms. - What do you want? - I want to know what you want. - I wanna go eat. - All right then, you're a journalist sniffing out scandals among the English nobility. No? What then? - Why don't you tell me? You've been staring at me hard enough the past two hours. - Why did you let me take you to dinner? - I was hungry. - (Laughs) That won't do. I suspect an ulterior motive. - I've got no intentions of going to bed with you. - Not at the moment, no. You're after something quite different, but you're not very skilled at deception. So, what is it? What do you do in Kentucky? - I have a small farm. I train and board horses. It's bluegrass country. - Thoroughbreds? - No. (laughs) I train them for pleasure riding. - And no men in your life? - If you knew the first thing about taking care of horses you'd know there's no spare time. You're staring at me again. - I wonder why? (light classical music) - Can I have my hand back, please? (light classical music) - What intrigues me is here you are, an American tourist, touching down in the land of your forefathers and where do you go to first? The Tower of London? Hampton Court? Windsor Castle? No, you make Bredon Hall your prime objective and it's not even in the guidebooks. Now that I find distinctly odd. - Well we Americans can be quite original. Didn't you know that? - Look, how about paying a formal visit to Bredon Hall tomorrow morning? (yawns loudly) I would like you to come. I'll have a surprise for you. (light classical music) (horse whinnies) - Is all this yours? - Yup. - It's beautiful. (horse whinnies) (horse hooves clop) Hi there! - Morning, miss. (horse whinnies) - Oh, it's a Neesan. - Good morning, Dan! - Good morning, sir. - You'll note how Miss Cantrell has made a b-line for our top stabler. Oh, this is Dan Maguire, my head groomer. - Pleased to know you, Mr. Maguire. - [Dan] Morning. - He must be your pride and joy. - Three times winner at Ascot, placed in the Derby. (car horn honks) - Wow, who is that? (chuckles) - The red shadow himself, come to collect the best filly we've had for 10 years. - Morning! - Shhh! Fordingbridge is listening to Swan Lake! - Bum bum bum bum, bum bum bum, bum bum bum - Michael! - I've come to take that troublesome filly off your hands. - She's a perfect filly and you know it. How are you? - I'm very happy to see you, as always. And your lovely companion. - Casey Cantrell, Hamdan al Dubai, not to be taken seriously. - An inexpressible pleasure, Miss Cantrell. - Hi. - That'll do, Hamdan. Why don't we go up to the house? I'm sure we're all ready for coffee. (birds squawk) - A two week vacation? But how can you possibly see England in only two weeks? - I have a job. It's all the time I can spare. - Well, I can't allow Michael to monopolize you. You must come and visit me at my house. - It's the other side of London, stockbroker country. Not real, old London, Casey. - (Laughs) And what is Bredon Hall? A magnificent warehouse for antiques. If it were mine, I should fill it with wives and children, but Michael fails in his dynastic duty, Miss Cantrell. I shall buy it. I see it as a health farm. Very profitable. - (laughs) You'll have a job convincing my father of that. - But what use is it to Richard? He never comes here! - Your father lives someplace else? - Yes, in London. - Which is where you should be, Miss Cantrell, charming as this rural backwater may be. I'm driving back this afternoon. Why don't you let me take you away from all this. - Hamdan... - Well, I should be getting back. Yes, I'd love a ride, thanks. - [Hamdan] Excellent! - Well, Hamdan will be busy with Dan Maguire til lunch time. That gives us a couple of hours. (light classical music) (horses galloping) You look good on a horse. - Not really about looking good, now is it? - I'll rephrase that. You ride very well. - You're damn right I do. (chuckles) - And modest, too! (dramatic classical music) (horses galloping) - [Stable Hand] All right, miss? - That was great. (horse whinnies) - Why do you suddenly have to be back in London? - There's some things I need to do. - That can't wait? Like coming to Bredon Hall couldn't wait yesterday. - I just have to get back. - And during the holidays he'd invite me down to Bredon Hall. Through university, our second class honors degrees and first class romantic escapades to our present rivalry in love and enterprise. I've always been extremely fond of Michael. - Then you must know Lord Bredon very well. - Oh, he's like a second father to me. - What does he do? - My dear Miss Cantrell, men like Lord Bredon don't do, they can control. We're business associates sometimes, sometimes rivals. We both enjoy the world of finance, although I do think Richard Bredon takes it to extremes. He very rarely leaves his offices in Half Moon Square. (people talking) (car engines) (church bells) (bicycle bell tinkles) (light classical music) - [Casey's Mother Voiceover] Try to deliver this letter for me. If Lord Bredon is still alive, put it into his own hands. - Look, maybe if I just spoke to his secretary personally. - We really can't let you upstairs without first knowing your business. - I just wanna give this letter to Lord Bredon. - The fact that I don't live there is irrelevant. I still have a say in what happens at Bredon Hall, Richard. - You don't, but I still need your signature. - Obviously. When do you want to see me for anything else? - Excuse me. - I intend to go ahead regardless. - I think you'll find that rather difficult. - Lord Bredon. You are Lord Bredon? - Just see my wife to her car, would you? - [Security Man] Sir. - Lord Richard Bredon? - Yes. I've got a letter for you. I'm Casey Cantrell. - Cantrell? - Yes, I just came over from the states-- - Did you say Cantrell? - Yes. Perhaps you knew my mother, Jesse. - I don't think so. - Jesse Cantrell? - The name means nothing to me. - But Lord Bredon, this letter is clearly addressed to you. - It was my mother's dying wish that I give you this letter. (somber classical music) I'm sorry, I didn't mean to give you such a shock. - I'm afraid you have the wrong man, Miss Cantrell. - I... - Good afternoon. - But Lord Bredon, if you just look at the letter you could see that... (dramatic classical music) (piano music) (laughs) (telephone rings) - Hello? - Michael! - Yes. - The flowers were incredibly beautiful. Thank you, it was such a surprise. - Oh, not what you'd expect from a, what was it? An arrogant, overbearing aristocratic bully. - (Laughs) Did I really call you that? - And a gorilla. - Well, you were being a bit aggressive, in case you don't remember. - I remember holding you. - The flowers are lovely, should I describe them? - Casey! Are you busy tomorrow? - No. - Well, I have to go into London to the office. I should be through by mid-afternoon. Could we meet then? - Sure, yeah. Great. - Good. Look I'll telephone you when I know a time. - [Casey] Okay, good. - Bye. - [Casey] Bye. (light classical music) (trumpets heralding music) - [Casey Voiceover] It was my mother's dying wish that I give you this letter. - [Richard Voiceover] I'm afraid you have the wrong man, Miss Cantrell. (ominous sirens) - [Jesse Voiceover] Hold me Richard, please. - [Richard Voiceover] I love you! (boat horn honks) (seagulls squawk) (telephone buttons beep) - Hello, Miss Casey Cantrell's room, please. (phone rings) (water runs) - Hello? - Good morning, Casey, it's Hamdan. - Hi there. You promised me you'd have lunch on my yacht today. - I did? Funny, I don't remember saying that. - No, but I'm sure you meant to. (chuckles) Will you? - Yes, thank you. I'd love to. - Ah, Fordingbridge. - Sir? I shall need the car just after mid-day. - Ah, yes sir. That'll be Miss Cantrell. I'll arrange the lunch. - Hi there. - Good morning. - Be one minute. - Oh, Miss Cantrell, there's a call for you on the center phone. - Oh, thank you. (phone rings) Hello? - [Voice On The Phone] Casey! - Michael, hi. - The office here is in a terrible state of shock. - Why, what happened? - I've done a lot of work. They can't understand it. (laughs) In fact, I now have time for a decent lunch break. I'll pick you up. - Oh, I'm sorry, Michael, I have other plans. - I thought you didn't know anyone in London. - Well, it's only Hamdan. He's invited me to lunch on his yacht. - Oh. Oh well, that's all right. I'll see you later, bye. - [Casey] No thanks. - (Laughs) Too late. Anyway, another glass and maybe you'll tell me more about yourself. - There really isn't anything else to tell. - You must miss your mother very much. - I'd miss her more I guess if I didn't feel she was right here beside me every moment of the day. She's the reason I'm here. So, Michael has an apartment here, you said. - Yes, in that block over there. - Oh! - It is odd, isn't it, how often Michael comes up in our conversation? - His father must be disappointed, not to have a line of heirs and successors like you were saying the other day at Bredon Hall. Well, Michael has always enjoyed the company of women, but he's never been able to bring himself to somehow wholly trust one. He thinks of some devious and calculating woman lying in wait for him. (tires rolling on pavement) (light classical music) - Hello, Casey. Hello, Hamdan. Sorry I'm late. Chicken? Oh Hamdan, you know I don't like chicken. - Yes, I do, but I didn't invite you to lunch. - Didn't you? - Oh, but I'm sure that you meant to. - I took the liberty of preparing salmon for you, my lord. - Thank you, Fordingbridge, very thoughtful. How do you like his little boat? - It's perfect. - You'll like the house, too. I'm giving a party tonight. Michael's coming, but will have an attractive escort, I'm sure, whereas I, the poor host, have none. Won't you take pity on me? You will enjoy yourself. - I really don't have anything to wear to a party. - There's this little shop in Knightsbridge. We could drive over afterwards if you'd like. - Hamdan, behave yourself. As it happens, I have no attractive escort, whereas Bluebeard here probably has dozens. I'd be delighted if you'd come with me. - Well, I-- - I understand that you've managed to persuade my father to come to your party. - Of course. My parties are not to be missed. - Will you come with me? - I'd love to. (upbeat classical music) - Hamdan, don't you find there are some days when nothing seems to go right? - (laughs) Bon chance, mon ami. - Cheers, old thing. (upbeat classical music) - Thank you, Fordingbridge. - A pleasure. - [Michael Voiceover] Please accept this in the spirit with which it's given. It would just make me very happy to see you wear it tonight. Michael. (light classical music) - Oh! Oh my. - [Michael] Perfection. - Oh, I know, but you gotta let me pay you back for this. - Can't you accept a gift graciously? - Not from someone I just met. - There are no strings attached. I don't have to bribe my women. - I am not your woman. Who chose it? - An old friend. Stop fussing or we'll be late for this party. - No agreement, no party. - Don't be ridiculous. The pleasure of seeing you wear it is payment enough. (upbeat classical music) - (Laughs) Okay, fine. You win, okay? - Where did you get this? - It's my mother's. - Oh, surely not. - What do you mean, "Oh, surely not." This was very special to her. She wore it as long as I can remember. - I'm sorry, it's just that it's very similar to our family crest. It reminds me of a-- - Come on, let's go. I'm hungry. (fireworks boom) (fireworks whistle) (fireworks boom) (crowd gasps) - You need some help with that? - Oh, please. I'm flagging. - Oh good. You can have that. (fireworks boom) - How can you pack so much food into such a frail little body? - Must be my metabolism. Anyway, I figure if I eat well then the champagne won't all go to my head. - Pity. - Oh, no you don't. You are far too conceited to share the credit of my seduction with a glass or two of the old bubbly. (laughs) I think I better stand up while I still can. (fireworks whistle) (crowd applauds) (smooth jazz music) (squeals) (song ends) (crowd chatters) - Hello, Hamdan. - Richard. - Good party. - Yes. - Michael. - Father! May I introduce you to Casey Cantrell? - Michael-- - How did you meet this young woman? I don't know what form of blackmail she has in mind, but get rid of her. - Blackmail? - Whatever she says to you, you can be damn sure she's lying. - Father, what is this? - She's already tried it on me, yesterday afternoon. - Lord Bredon, can I just-- - You know my father? - Michael-- - Will you explain yourself, Casey? - Michael, you're hurting me. - Get her out of my sight, Michael. - Look, I just wanna deliver-- - I think you'd better come with me. - Michael, what are you doing? Or does everybody around here act like this? (fireworks boom) - All planned, was it? - No it wasn't, Michael! I wanted to tell you but I didn't think-- - Well, you better start explaining now! - Michael? Michael, could I have a word with you? - Not now, Henry. (fireworks boom) (crowd cheers) Come on, in here. Why did my father say you were blackmailing him? - I needed to see him. I had to. - Why? - To give him a letter. - Asking for money? - No. - And I was just another means to an end. - No, I... I needed your help to get the letter to him. Oh, believe what you want. - How far were you prepared to go to get what you want? - (crying) Not like this! (crying) Let me go. - Oh, Casey, my beautiful Casey. - Please let me go. - I can't. I shan't ever do that. (light classical music) - I need you to listen to me now. - Not here. (fireworks boom) (light classical music) (fireworks boom and whistle) (fire alarm bell chimes) (flames crackle) - [Fireman] (mumbles) the hydrant! Over here! (woman moans) - [Man] Be careful with it, be careful. (flames crackle) - Jess? (sirens blare) - They're coming back. - All right? (explosions and bangs) - Hold me, Richard, please. Until it's over. - Always. Always. I love you. - (Laughs) You hardly know me. - It doesn't matter. I love you. I shan't ever feel like this again about anyone, ever. (explosions and bangs) (fireworks whistle) (fireworks bang) (crowd gasps) - Hamdan, that young woman. Find out about her. - Richard, I don't understand this, but Casey is here as my guest. - I don't care, find out about her! Spend some time with her. - Under normal circumstances would be a pleasure. She's very attractive. - You've stolen his women before. - And he's stolen mine, it's a game. No one gets hurt. This time I suspect it's not a game for Michael. - It's certainly a game for her. - I think you're wrong, Richard. - I very much doubt it. (car horn honks) - Thanks, Gary. - Cheers, gov. - Oh my God, my bag. - What about your bag? - I think I left it behind. We were dancing and I put it down and you grabbed me and I... - Casey, Casey. You're bag will be returned, Casey. - Michael, it has the letter to your father in it. - Well, I'll phone Hamdan, don't worry. - Well, yes, but I-- - I said don't worry. - My mother gave it to me. I know he recognized it. - Oh, it is the family crest and I have seen this before. There's a portrait in the library at Bredon Hall of my great-grandma wearing a pendant very similar. - Michael, what if your father gave this necklace to my mother? - It's not the sort of thing you just give away. - How else would she have come by it? I think they knew each other. I think they knew each other very well.

Don't ask about her husband. She cries herself to sleep often enough as it is. - Emily! I was afraid you might've had to go back on duty. - I shall in a minute. Jesse, this is Richard Bredon. My flatmate, Mrs. Frank Cantrell from Kentucky. - Hello. - How do you do? - How on earth could they have met? As far as I know, my mother never came to England. - Did she ever talk about friends who lived in Europe? Surely somebody. - Well, there was one name, a Billy Cooper. It's in her address book back at the hotel... It's late I really think I should go. - Is that what you want to do? Ever since you fell off that wall into my arms I've wanted you. Even in the summer house tonight. - Oh my God, it's too soon. - (mumbles) I can say for you. (slow harmonica music) (heavy breathing) - But we hardly know each other. - We know everything we need to know. (romantic orchestral music) (car engine stops) - Good evening your lordship. - Evening, Yardly. - [Young Richard Voiceover] This can be our place, always. Whenever I have a post, I'll meet you here at nine o'clock. - I shall look for you every night.

So, unless you want to be ravished in front of the whole of Chelsea Harbour, I suggest you come back inside quickly. (giggles) - So, will it be coffee first or ravishing? - Coffee? (giggles) - Yes, yes Richard. He is with her now. - Well, he's coming in this morning. I'll keep him here most of the day. The rest is up to you. - Look Richard, I don't like the idea of-- (phone connection clicks off) - Okay, thank you. (knock at the door) Just a sec. - Guess who? - (Chuckles) Honestly. Hamdan. - A small gesture to console a lady who was greatly embarrassed whilst a guest in my house. - So are you alone or is there somebody in here with you? (laughs) Won't you come in? - I really am most very sorry. I looked for you afterwards. - Oh, I left with Michael. - Oh, thank you! - It is still in there, the letter to Lord Bredon. I can assure you Fordingbridge has guarded your property with a devotion he scarcely gives to mine. - I don't know how I could thank you. - Casey, I'd like to help. - Oh, I don't see how... Unless you can help me find the Duke of Argyle. - Oh, it's a duke now, is it? - Oh Hamdan. It's a pub near Windsor. - Oh, excellent. We'll take a picnic on the river. - [Casey] Hamdan! - [Hamdan] Well why not? (cheery music) - Do you believe all these birds? Oh, Hamdan, this is glorious. If only... - If only, what? - Nothing. - If only Michael were here, hm? - Thank you. - Casey, for years I have known Lord Bredon as the most urbane and civilized of Englishman. Without extreme provocation, he would never, never make a scene in public. - That's his problem. I haven't got any secrets. But I tend to think he might. - Well, let's hope you're all the lovely things you seem to be. But remember, I'm devoted to Michael. Anyone upsetting his apple cart would have me to reckon with. - Me, too, Hamdan. I'd be right there before the apples hit the sidewalk. - Come in, Michael. - I want to talk to you about last night and Casey. - You didn't do what I asked. You didn't get rid of her. - No. - Why not? - Several reasons. One being that I'd never before known you to be so unreasonable. - Just for once, Michael, don't ask any questions. Please do as I ask. - No questions, dad? Not, how could Casey blackmail you? Not, how did her mother get our family pendant? (tense strings music) - Please go away Michael. - It was my grandmother's pendant. - I shall wear this to keep you safe. - Loving you will keep me safe. - I couldn't bear to lose you, too. - Oh, Jess. - I can't go through it all again, Richard. - You won't have to. We'll see each other whenever I can get to London. - I think not knowing is the worst part. Not knowing if you're safe in England or out over Germany. Hold me, Richard. Please come back safely. - [Young Richard Voiceover] I promise. - Sir? - Oh, well done Fordingbridge. So, that's Billy Cooper. - Yes, it is, sir. It's the landlady. She seems to have known Miss Cantrell's mother many years ago. Though, I did think that Miss Cantrell's mother had never visited England. - I can't believe my mom was here during the war. I just don't know why she never told me. - She and Frank had been married no more than a week then he was posted to Europe, so Jesse up packs her frocks, comes to London to be near him. Not that she sees much of him. It was a very hush-hush mission. They were dropped behind enemy lines. - So that's when dad was so badly wounded. - They were all so bloody young then. Planting explosives in the dark, I ask you. Your dad would've been all right if he hadn't tried to save my Joe. Bad, it was. Can't have been much of him left worth saving, poor lamb. - So what did my mom do while she was here all that time. - She wangled her way over as a singer. She sang with some of the big bands. - (laughs) My mother? A singer? - Yes! And she was good, Casey, she was very good. When the mission went wrong, she thought your dad was dead. - George, I'd like you to run a check on someone for me. Casey Cantrell, American, Morrow, Kentucky. She breeds and trains horses. Apparently here on holiday. Well, mainly her past, background, family, contacts, that sort of thing. (humming) Anything you can find. Particularly what she may be doing here apart from having a holiday. - There was a bloke your ma liked a lot. He was in the RAF. I remember the first time he saw her. He couldn't take his eyes off her. He came into the Half Moon Club with this snooty bit, Emily. Lady Emily if anyone spoke out of turn. I remember her because your ma shared a flat with her for a few months. Trouble was Emily's bloke was more interested in your ma than her. - Do you think my mother and this air force officer were close? - Didn't do to ask too many questions in those days. We took our comfort where we could find it. I don't know what was going on. Richard, that's right. His name was Richard. (airplane engines roar) (sirens blare) (soldiers speak in foreign language) - [Pilot] Steady, bombs away! (rapid gunfire) (explosions) - [Soldier] We have to bailout! - We do not bail out! ♫ Safe in my arms again ♫ How I dream of that moment when ♫ At our old rendezvous I'll be holding you ♫ Safe in my arms again ♫ Safe in my arms again - She's just coming off stage. (applause) - Mrs. Cantrell? - Oh Richard, no. (dramatic music) - That telegram stunned her, though. She was absolutely knocked back. - What did it say? - Well, that your father was alive after all. That he hadn't been killed at all. - No, wait. Fordingbridge is getting the umbrella for you! - It doesn't matter. No, thank you! Bye! - An exceptional young lady, sir. - Well at least you had a good day. Dad was very hard work. - What's wrong? - I tried to talk to him about you, about your mother. He won't listen, he won't talk to me. I hardly recognize him. - Was your dad in the air force? - What, during the war? Yup, why? - 'Cause I think I may have found an answer to some of our questions. - Really? And? - And if you're very good I might tell you what they are. - Come on, old chap. It can hardly be classified information. The poor man's been dead for years. Cantrell, that's right. Frank Theodore Cantrell. 1944. - I still can't imagine my mother on stage. - Love can make a woman behave very odd. - But, I found out that that RAF officer was your father. - He is not the type. Fond as I am of the old boy, I can't imagine him betraying any romantic feelings whatsoever. - Love can make men behave oddly, too, ya know. I'm not comfortable with this. - What? - I thought I knew my parents. Now I find out that they're not at all what they seemed to be. So where does that leave me? - Here. Where you belong. I envy you, you know. - Why? - When you talk about your mother. I never really knew what was wrong between my mother and father. I supposed in the end there just wasn't enough love. Any love it seemed sometimes. - I guess I always knew my parents loved me. I'd want that for my children. I guess I better get some salad. - I can see I'm gonna go bankrupt feeding you. - (laughs) My mother always used to tease me about my appetite. - I think that was an oblique way of asking you to marry me. (light music) Casey. I'm sorry, it wasn't a very romantic proposal but I have no experience. You're the first woman I've asked. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. - Oh, how can you be? You don't even-- - Because I spent a very long time waiting for what most people seem to encounter so easily. Now, at last, amazingly it's happened. I'm in love and I intend to marry you. You will? Please, you can't turn me down. - Yes. I mean, no, yes. (laughs) - Oh, (chuckles) make your mind up. - It is made up. It's been made up. (upbeat classical music) (horses galloping) - Come in and see him with me. - I want him to read the letter first. - It's the first time in six months he's been to the hall. He's bound to be in a good mood. - Give him the letter. (light music) - Read it! - No, Michael. - Why in heavens name don't you just open it and find out what Jesse Cantrell wanted you to know? - It's contents have no interest for me. - Well they do for me! - I refuse to submit to blackmail. - Oh, stop talking about blackmail! Casey looks on this letter as a sacred trust. - Michael, she's a tough little negotiator down on her luck. She's come across some old secret and she thinks she can exploit it. Well of course it's blackmail! I refuse to have anything to do with her. - You were in love with Jesse Cantrell weren't you? You gave her great-grandmother's pendant. Can you deny that? - Not to you. I did give that pendant to Mrs. Cantrell because I believed that I knew her and she was worthy of it. Later on I found out that I didn't know her at all. She was absolutely worthless. - So you did love her? - I thought I did. Certainly my intentions were serious. But she broke every promise without a backward glance. Anyway, she's dead now so it really doesn't matter at all. - Whatever happened then, how ever much it hurt you, you can't let it cast a shadow when Casey and I are married. - When you are what? - I've asked Casey to marry me. - She slept with you? - How dare you. - Like mother like daughter. - How dare you belittle our feelings when you don't even know Casey. - She certainly wasted no time. - Whatever you thought of Jesse, her daughter's as honest as the day. - Michael, you've known for years what marriage has been like for me. I think that gives me the right to ask you to listen to me. - How could you possibly understand? - There's no point in talking about marriage with a man who's never been in love. (footsteps tap) (light piano music) (pouring rain) - Well then, sir. Isn't it time you were home in bed? You've been here quite a while. - I'm all right. Thank you, officer. - Are you waiting for someone, sir? - I thought I was. (somber music) (doorbell rings) - Emily. - Hello, I've been expecting you. - Is Jesse here? - I'm sorry Richard, she's gone. - Gone? - Where? When? - My dear, I really don't know. When I came off duty she and her belongings had simply vanished. - She can't have just gone. She couldn't do that. Did she leave a note? - Nothing. Darling, you look dreadful. You'd better come in. (somber music) - Thanks. (light classical music) Get me back to town as quick as you can, all right? - You think she was telling the truth? She really does run a riding stable? - On a modest income, but adequate to her needs. She's quite credit worthy and she doesn't have a criminal record. - Whiskey? - Please. And according to a short obituary notice after her mother's death, the family are held in high respect locally. - And the mother? Tell me. - She was a tower of strength. Her absolute dedication to her late husband is recalled. He was confined to a wheelchair. - Her second husband? - Her only husband. Frank Theodore Cantrell. - No, no, no, no, check the data. - I have checked it, Richard. - Her first husband was killed in France in 1943. Well, I know, I mean, I knew her! She was a widow. - Frank Theodore Cantrell was reported dead after an exceptionally dangerous mission. The resistance found him badly wounded. They took him to a convent where he was secretly nursed by nuns until it was safe to bring him back across the Channel. It was some months before he was even identified. - Some months? (laughs) I thought he was dead! - No, he was left for dead. (dramatic music) - [Young Richard] How long have I known you? - 11 weeks and two days. - And today for the first time you laughed with no cares, just sheer joy. - I've come alive again with you. - We have so much to live for. - It's not just loving you. You make me feel so safe. I always trust you, Richard. - How do I know why he's changed his mind? Maybe he's been crazy all these years and I just never knew it. Anyway, suddenly he's over the moon about our marriage. - That's all that matters. - Maybe I'll catch him at the office before he leaves, make sure it still is my father. (seagulls squawk) - You're not very like your mother. - You knew my mother? - This is all most unfortunate. - Pardon me? What is? - I take it your mother was the little actressy person who shared my flat for a time during the war? That Jesse Cantrell. You're not very like her. - Your name is Emily. - Oh, I see you know quite a lot already, but not enough. Such a pity. It was very wrong of your mother to send you in quest of the Bredon family. All communication between us ceased long ago. - Well, now that Michael and I are going to be married, I... - What has your mother told you? - Nothing. Nothing about anything. - As an old friend of hers, I'd like you take my advice. Go back to America. - Lady Bredon, what is this? - Just go home without contacting Michael again or offering any explanation. - I won't hurt Michael. - Take my word for it, you have no hope of marrying him. The reason is bound to distress you. - I'll risk that. - Very well. I would have spared you, but... You may have realized that while your father was lying injured in France, your mother was conducting an adulterous affair with my husband. - It wasn't like that. - You want proof? When your father was brought to England he had appalling burns and needed specialist treatment. Your mother left London to be near him. I dare say she regretted her infidelity by this time. Too late. Some months later I drove a patient to that same hospital. - Emily! - Jesse, so this is where Frank is. - How's Richard? Have you any news? - More to the point, how's Frank? Well, it's bound to take time. - They're trying to save his sight. There's so little I can do except be with him. - When he does see you, my dear, how will you explain that? - Frank loves me. - That much? Of course, you don't know do you? Richard and I were married just before he went to the Far East. - My family had a shooting lodge in Scotland, private, remote from anywhere. The baby was born there and registered as mine. - You took her baby? - My dear child, she gave him away. - No! No matter how difficult, no matter how ashamed, she-- - But with a husband likely to be a permanent invalid. - Not my mother. She couldn't. - But she could. She cried, begged, pleaded with me. - To let her keep him! - To help her. - It wasn't like that! I knew her. - Then you know she would want the best for her baby. He was Richard's child, too. - Does Lord Bredon know? - Of course not. When the war ended and he eventually came home, there was no need to tell him. He could hardly wait to hold in his arms the son and heir I'd promised in my letters. In your present state you won't appreciate it, but I took good care of your mother. Michael has always been mine. He can never be yours. Even if I thought you were suitable, you can never marry your brother, can you? (sobbing) - Here's to you and Casey. - Thanks for telling me about Jesse. - It's such a relief to know the truth about her. At last. - Tell me, dad. Why did you marry Ma? - Our families had always assumed we would. I suppose we assumed we would. Until I saw Jesse. And when she disappeared I didn't much care what became of me. It wasn't very fair to your mother, I know, but I thought we might make a go of it. We had a lot of things in common. Unfortunately love wasn't one of them. - No more crying, she's washing her face. (somber music) - Thanks for putting up with me, for not asking any questions. I just didn't want to go back to the hotel and... you've been so kind. I'm ready to go. - You can't fly back to the States today. Just like that. - I don't have a choice. - No goodbyes? - Fordingbridge, bring the car. - Yes, sir. - Why? I mean, what has she said? - Just that she must go. I thought you should know, sir. - Yup, I'm on my way. - Casey, what's wrong? - Get me out of here. - Tell me what's happened? Please, Casey, just tell me! - I've got a plane to catch, Michael, I'm sorry. - What plane? Why are you leaving? - Casey, you two have got to talk. - I refuse to believe it. She could be lying. - It'd hurt her too much for it to be a lie. - I know my father has no idea. - She didn't tell him. - He ought to know. - What's the point? - I never want to see her again. - Oh, Michael. You don't mean that. - To find out my mother isn't my mother, that the woman I want to marry-- - Just stop it! - There isn't anything we can do about it now. (somber music) - What was she like? Our mother? - I don't know. I've lost her. - She must've been very special to go on loving someone for a lifetime without seeing him. - I don't have to justify myself to you after all this time, Richard. - You knew. You knew Frank Cantrell had come back. - Which doesn't alter the fact that Jesse ran out on you. - Why did you never tell me that he was still alive? - Because he might've died at any moment. He was in a bad way. And then you would've married Jesse. No, a clean break was much the best thing. - For who? For her? For me? I went through agonies and you allowed me to. I mean, all you had to say was... Jesse knew I had come looking for her at the flat. She left a message with you, didn't she? Didn't she, Emily? - [Young Richard Voiceover] Dearest Jesse, I've been out of action for a while. I will explain. Meet me on Tuesday in Half Moon Square. I have a very important question to ask. I love you so very much. Richard. - What is it? - It's Frank. He's alive. He's in England. - Oh, you must be overjoyed. - They told me he's terribly injured. He might die. I'll have to go to him. - Of course. Well, can I help in any way? - No. I must get in touch with Richard but I don't know where he is. - The important thing is to be with your husband. He needs you. - Of course, but I can't go without explaining to Richard. - Write a note. I'll make sure he gets it. - I'll pack right away. I thought they're might've been a message from Richard. - Nothing. - She did leave a message, didn't she Emily? - I won't be cross-examined like this. It's too long ago. - You kept back something as important as that. My God, Emily, I thought at least you were fond of me. - Fond of you. I loved you. All the time we were growing up, and you were quite fond of me. If you hadn't met Jesse Cantrell it would've been enough. - We should never have married. - If it hadn't been for Michael I suppose... - You'd have left me almost at once, I'm well aware of it. - Michael is my one consolation. I asked you here because I wanted to tell you that I'm giving Bredon Hall to him and Casey as a wedding present. - There isn't going to be a wedding. - Well, of course there's going to be a wedding. - No, Richard. - Why? - You never really knew how much I loved you, did you? How much I wanted you and Bredon Hall. I've always been willing to do anything to get what I really wanted. - Oh yes, I know you're unscrupulous. - Unscrupulous? (laughs) Yes, that's a good word. - What have you done, Emily? - With Jesse's help, I've cheated you. I've lived a lie, Richard, ever since Michael was born. (sobbing) - What's this? - Another file on Miss Cantrell. It arrived this morning. - You think my investigations are in some way responsible for this, I suppose. - I couldn't venture an opinion, sir. (somber music) - I don't know what to say, except thank you for telling me. It can't have been easy. - I wanted you to understand so you could help Michael. - Fordingbridge, (whispers). - Good sir. - Whatever has happened in my life, I have never forgotten you and I have never forgotten our son. I gave him to you because he was all there was of me to give. In staying with Frank I did what I thought was right. I have been happy I guess, but I have always known that there was a deeper happiness I could only have found with you. At the end of my life I love you still as I loved you then. (somber music) (dramatic music) - What are you doing? - Don't ask any questions. Casey, please, just trust me. (knock at the door) - My Lord? - Casey! - I brought her back. - Please, I can't stay here. - You promised to trust me. So trust me. Richard, read this. - It's true? - The documentation, it's all there. - What's this about, Dad? - Just a minute, Michael. (sniffles) I treated you very badly, Casey. You'll never really know how sorry I am for that. Perhaps I might have the opportunity to make up for it, though. You and I have something in common. We both loved Jesse very, very much and she loved us. She talked about you in that letter and about the joy that you brought into her life from the moment you arrived. There is one thing she didn't say, though. She and your father could never have children. You were adopted when you were just a few days old. (sobbing) Casey, you loved Jesse and Jesse loved you. That's the important thing. Just hang on to that. And remember, Jesse sent you here to us. We're your family now. - Forever and ever. (joyful classical music) - [Jesse Voiceover] I don't know how many years will pass before you read these words, or indeed if you will ever read them at all. When you do, I hope you'll know that I am keeping my date with you in Half Moon Square. Even now my thoughts go back to our meeting place and the love I should've brought to you, which has never changed, never grown cold. I am yours forever. Jesse.
