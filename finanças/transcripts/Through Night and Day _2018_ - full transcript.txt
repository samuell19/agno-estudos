Every time I look at her, I forget everything. She's all I see. She's my world. She's the only one I want to be with. From now on, what's important is the life I'm going to be spending with her. Jennifer! What's wrong with you? Why aren't you dressed yet? -Dad! -It's eight o'clock! Ben called, he's waiting for you. My phone's dead. Wait a minute. That's why Ben couldn't get in touch with you. Did you forget about your date? No, no. I just lost track of time. Okay, I'm gonna leave now. Saving. -Hurry up! -Okay. Wait, where are you going? I'm coming with you. Why? When I ask you to come to church you never come. And now you're going to a bar? I'm meeting a friend there. I see... Who is this friend? Let's go. So, Dad, where did you meet her? On Tinder? No. Then where? I wouldn't mind having a new mom. Stop with the questions. Your boyfriend is waiting! Alright! I'm going. Hello, we're on our way. Okay. Okay, okay. Dad? I'm coming. Hurry! Are they here yet? They're on the way. Just stand by. Hey Ben, what time is it over there? It's 8:00 a.m. in New York. It's 9:00, ma. Does Raul know your plans? That's good. Where are they? I'm getting impatient. They're here now. Here we go. -Hello! -Babe! I'm so sorry! You're just in time. -Hello, Hello. -Hello. Babe, this one's for you. Wow. Can I tell you how I feel? Can I offer you My loving heart? My only dream Is to be with you forever Come hell or high water I won't let you go I love you I truly love you They can throw grenades They can aim a bazooka Nothing can stop my love for you I want to tell you The other day I was gazing afar Smiling to myself You inspire me You make me giddy Thinking of my future with you My princess I love you I truly love you They can throw grenades They can aim a bazooka Nothing can stop my love for you They can't stop my love for you Babe... you are such a big part of my past, my present. I can't imagine a future without you. Here we go. Wait! Babe, stop. Will you let me finish? Wait, please! -This is embarrassing. -Don't propose yet. My nails are ugly. Look. This one finger is okay. Put the ring here. Don't "dirty finger" me. I'm not. We have no choice! -Seriously? -Please. Please! I'll put this ring on any finger. Will you marry me? Yes. I'll transfer the ring when I get a manicure. Babe, we need to plan the wedding. Do you want a coordinator? No, I don't want a grand wedding. I want it to be intimate. -Are you sure? -Yes. Let's just have a nice prenup video. Well, that's cheaper. Prenup video it is! Okay! Right, that would lessen unwanted gifts. Yeah, we can't take those to New York. You haven't decided yet. Babe, I want to take the bar exam. What for? You'll fail anyway. You're so mean! Who knows, this time I'll pass. I'm sure you won't. Even if you pass the bar exam, New York law is different. Will you take the bar exam there again? You'll definitely fail! That's harsh! I just want to finish what I started. That's all. What for? For myself. Is that wrong? If you love me, you'll understand. -I love you. -No. You don't give me what I want. So I guess you don't love me. Really? If I didn't love you, I wouldn't have agreed when you asked that we stop having sex. -Don't say that. -No, listen. You're a Christian now. -You said no sex. -Right. I agreed. You let me taste the forbidden fruit and then took it back. -Shut up! -I endured it. I endured it even if it was hard. Baby, just shut up. You're annoying! If you only knew how many girls want to have sex with me. Beautiful, sexy, and with bigger boobs. Ouch. Okay. Then go to them. If it's too much to ask we should split up. I'd rather not have sex than lose you. Lucky you! All I want is assurance that you want this as much as I do. Babe, you still need assurance? Who loves you despite your Dumbo ears? And that time you shat your pants thinking it was just a fart. Babe, I didn't leave you. Do you want me to continue? -Don't get me started. -Go ahead! -I'll start. -Okay. Alright. Your boobs are small and lopsided. -I didn't think that was possible. -How rude! And if your head weren't attached, you'd lose it. -You want more? -Go ahead. Your armpits. What's wrong with my armpits? A lot. Smell my armpits. Why? I already know they smell! See? We accept each other. So we're meant for each other, okay? And my love for you is the only thing I'm sure of. I couldn't agree more. In all our years together, you were never jealous of any woman. You only have to worry about my left hand. Be grateful that I don't use my right. This one's dirtier. -See? -Don't touch my hair! I'm trying to grow it out for our wedding. -Really? -Yes. Baby, I need to pee. -Do it there. -No. -Let's go home. -Okay. Can I piggyback? Piggyback! Piggyback! What about piggy-front? No. My God, you're heavy! My mom said, she's looking for a place for the coffee shop. We can do that or you can work elsewhere. Get off. I'm tired. Babe, if I go with you, what about Dad? Hang on! I can take care of myself. No, Dad. No, you can't. I'll never leave you. Jennifer, you need to start your own family. When you marry Ben, go forth and multiply! Who will take care of you, Dad? Who will make coffee for you? Two sugar, one cream. What about your vitamins? Who will remind you to tuck your stomach in? Babe, we won't leave Dad when we go to New York. -He's coming with us. -I don't want to. It's cold there! I have arthritis! I don't want to keep speaking English. I think we should call it a night. It might be hard for you to find a ride back home. Go on. -Bye baby. -Alright, bye. Thank you for tonight. Good night. Bye, I love you. -Bye, Dad. -Take care. -Bye. -Bye. Text me when you get home! Okay! I'm home! That's my perfect boy-next-door. I know. Babe! Babe! Yes? What is that? I have a gift for you. What is it? What is it? Birthday gift, Christmas gift, Valentines gift, Anniversary gift. All gifts all together in this gift. Baby, you don't know me well enough. I already know everything about Iceland! You're so stupid. No, really. -That's why you keep failing the bar exam. -What is this? -We're going to Iceland. -Seriously? -Yes. -Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I'm finally going to see Seljalandsfoss falls! That's not all you're going to see there. Wait, I get it. This is because you want my body? Wow, you're suddenly so expensive! I used to get it for free. No seriously. Okay seriously. Remember in high school you said Iceland was on your bucket list. Yeah. So I saved up for it. And now we're going. And that's where we'll shoot our prenup video. Like celebrities who go abroad to shoot their prenups? We'll post it on social media to get a lot of likes. I don't want to post on social media. I want it to be for our eyes only. Okay, whatever you want. -Okay. -We'll leave next month, okay? Really? Next month? Oh, my God! -I love you. -Thank you. -I love you. -You're the best. Are you taking all of this? You're only staying for two weeks! Dad, we're shooting a prenup video. These are for my OOTD. Great. The house will be quiet even if it's just for two weeks. I'm sure you'll keep calling. "Jen, Come home. I miss you." "I'm all alone here." Look Dad, this will make you cry. Don't tell me you failed again? No! No! What's this? I applied for a U.S. Visa. Did Jen finally agree? She doesn't want to talk about it. What if she doesn't want to live in New York? What will you do? Have you told Ben yet? Does he know about all this? Not yet. He's not the only one with surprises, right? I'll tell him on our last day in Iceland. So we'll come home happy. Ma, where Jen wants to stay, I'll stay. I've loved her since high school. She's the only girl I've ever loved. So wherever she is that's where I want to be. Even before he gave me his gift, I'd already decided to go with him. Ben's the only man I've ever loved. Not counting you, of course. I couldn't bear to lose him. I need him by my side. Welcome to my country. Let's go. Welcome to Iceland. Yes. How many irons and dryers did you bring? And how much makeup? This is so heavy! I need to look great for the prenup video, you know? Wait a second. What's taking you so long? Do you need help? No, it would be too much to ask. That's my baby. He's a gentleman. That's why I love him! I love you. -Shut up. -You're something else. How many cameras did you bring? -Three. -Why? I'm going all out with this video! And when we post this on social media, it will go viral for sure. I thought you didn't like that? "I don't like posting on social media. It should be for our eyes only. " -Did I really say that? -Yeah. Stop putting words into my mouth! What can I put in your mouth? How rude! -I have a question. -Yes. Where's the toilet? There's no toilet inside, just go in the campsite. What? Baby? There's no toilet? I brought a bedpan! It's all part of the adventure. Okay? You're gonna be okay. Okay, thank you. Okay, but before you go you need to sign the papers please. Just sign. And remember, 112 is the emergency number. And there's no insurance for any damage underneath the car. -Okay. -Okay? Have a good trip. Bye-bye. Babe. I'm ready. Luck from the Philippines. Thank you for my trip, baby. But I think the driver needs a kiss. Forget it. -Babe. -Bread costs 900 krona. Four hundred and fifty pesos. And a dozen eggs is 700 krona, 350 pesos? Water costs 290 krona! Around 140 to 145 pesos! This is only 30 pesos! Babe, they don't buy bottled water here. Iceland has the cleanest tap water in the world. Iceland? Isn't it Greenland? Greenland, Switzerland, Finland, New Zealand, anything with "land" has clean water. Seven thousand three hundred and fifty krona. Seven thousand. You're paying? Nope. Welcome to Hveragerdi. The blossoming town. I don't see any blossoms. They're all inside the greenhouse. Over there, sir. Over to my right. And over to my left, is a very handsome gentleman. Oh, wow. Hey, babe. Let's find a place where we can shower. We need a change of clothes and a bath. Okay? Then let's eat in Fridheimar. What can we eat there? -Tomatoes. -Tomatoes? Yes. Yes. You're not allowed to eat that. How vulgar! Are your photos any good? Can we eat? I'm so hungry I could eat someone. Really? You'll go to prison. You'll be alone there. Iceland has a zero crime rate. Since I stole a tomato, I can join you in jail. So yeah, we're going to be together. Stop! Right there, right now. Wait. Hang on. -Now, can I eat? -Yep. But I need to take a selfie first. Aren't you eating, you'll just take selfies? Babe, soon this will all be just a memory. Exactly. You won't know the taste of the tomato soup, because you're too busy taking pictures. There's no point if you miss the moment. On the contrary, you can relive the moment per se, ad infinitum, if you capture it in a photo. Res ipsa loquitur. Don't go all lawyer on me... because you're not a real lawyer yet. Babe, which is a better shot? This? Or this? -They look the same to me. -Babe, they're not the same. Look, this or this? Babe, what are you doing in there? Babe, have a look. Do you remember this? You brought this with you? -No wonder your bags are so heavy. -No, really. This is from Grade four! The record of everything we wanted to say to each other. This is where I confessed that I loved you. The priest's sermon made you admit it. He did say "Love Your Neighbor!" And you took that literally. Only because I thought you were never coming back from New York. It was only for Summer break. Of course, we were coming back. If I didn't write it down, we wouldn't be together now. You were so intimidated by my beauty. You've got nerve! Did you also admit in there that you wooed me? You should be grateful I did that. Or you'd never have a girlfriend. Beautiful. So beautiful. You should be thanking me. Why? Because I gave you a chance. I felt so sorry for you. I pitied you. Oh, really? Read this. Wait. I know where it is. Hang on, here it is. "Dear Jen, You don't know how happy I am that you are my girlfriend..." -Forgery! -Nonsense, such nonsense! You're ruining it! You wrote that yourself. I did not! No one journals anymore. There's technology for that. That's why I brought this. We can write to each other again here in Iceland. It's not just images and sounds, but thoughts and emotions. We can write it all down in here. But it's corny. -It's corny. -It's not corny. It's romantic. So you want me to write, here in Iceland? Instead of vacationing or sightseeing, you want me to write. Yes. Do it for me. Please? Okay, I'll do it for you. If you do... Quit that. I know where this is going. -Please? -No. What's wrong with you, babe? -Come on. -No. -Come on... -No. Let's not waste this heat. No. Babe? What do you want to do first? I can plan our route. I suggest we follow the Ring Road so we don't miss anything. -Okay. -But we must see the Aurora Borealis. What time does that come out? There's a specific time. The sky should be clear and it must be dark. We need to set the alarm so we can get up for it, okay? Okay. Really, Jen? What? You know I love that dress on you. Did you have to wear it tonight? But you said you understood! My brain does, but this guy doesn't. He's all head and no brains. He's an idiot. I have a solution. -Well, alright! -Babe! -What? -Your hands! Give me your hands. We're going to pray. We're praying for the lust to go away. It's okay. It's all gone. Babe? Babe... Babe. The Aurora Borealis is here! Quick, it's here! Come on, it's here! You'll be pissed at me if you don't get up. Babe. I'm still on Philippines time. Don't go blaming me later, okay? "Dear Jen, You were right about the Aurora Borealis. It was breathtakingly beautiful. Too bad you're still sleeping. I wish you were with me. It's okay, we're staying a while. There's a still a chance to see the Aurora Borealis together." I hate you. Why? I hate you. You're so unfair. -What are you mad at me for? -You didn't wake me! Babe, I did wake you! That's a lie. You said you were jet lagged! Then you should have dragged me out of bed! I would have woken up! Why are you so mad? It's our first night in Iceland, and you go to see the Aurora Borealis, not me. It's so unfair! This is my country! We're not allowed to argue in Iceland. You said it yourself. "There's zero crime rate in Iceland." That's what you said! But there's no law against picking a fight. -And I want to slug you right now. -Oh, you really want to fight? I forgot about what I was cooking! -You cooked? -Of course! Wow, thank you! -Oh no! -Babe! -What's wrong? -Oh, my God, it's burning. Wait, wait. Let's get some water. We need more water! Get more water. Okay, okay, okay. That's cold! Jen! What's wrong with you? Look at that sunset. So beautiful from any angle. Just like me. Yes, you're just like the sunset. Because I'm beautiful? Because you're on your way down. Think about this. It's easy to confuse the sunrise for a sunset. Do you know why? Because of the word "sun"? No, I'm serious. Why then? Because what you thought was an ending, could also be a beginning of something more beautiful. This is why I love you. Because I'm smart? You're such a know-it-all. I love you, baby. This is bliss. It's like we're in heaven. If only we could stay this way forever. We will be together forever. That is not an "if only". It's for real. "Dear Ben, Today was a good day. I know I burnt breakfast and we're still hungry, and we didn't go around much, but it's still a good day. Any day spent with you is a good day." Babe? You want to eat at that pizza place we passed? Sleeping already? Why are we taking a photo in the middle of the road? Smile! I think that's okay. -Did you get that? -Okay, we're good! Iceland is such a show-off. Yesterday was sunny. And now it's snowing? So exciting! -Yup! -Where are we going? We're headed to Thingvellir. But I want to go here, to Seljalandsfoss falls. Babe, we're over here. If we go straight down there we'll miss a lot of spots. "Babe, I suggest we follow Ring Road so we don't miss anything." That's what you said last night. No! We're going to Sevelja... Seljalandsfoss! There, I finally got that right! What can I do? This is your country, right? It's my country, and you do not have a say! -Okay? -Okay. This is my boyfriend. He's so nice to me. I could kick him and he still wouldn't leave me. Do you want me to kick him? Seriously? Please? I love you. I love you. Hey, easy. Let's do a "#FollowMeToo". -Okay? -Okay. One, two, three. Is that good? -Babe! -Wait! Hold me! You're supposed to be following me. Wait, babe! We're all wet and it's freezing! We have enough pictures! You look awful in them! You won't even smile! Your fingers are so stiff! This place is amazing, but if we just keep taking pictures we won't see how lovely it really is! And you won't see my frown from behind this camera anyway. Fine. Then let's take a selfie. Selfie! Babe, you're so stiff. You don't feel happy. Fine, here I go. I want this. It's a Volcano and a Glacier. Fire and Ice. So very Iceland. Babe? Babe? Stay up with me. I'm sleepy. I need someone to talk to. Babe, I have a headache. Fine. I'll decide the next stop, okay? Volcanic Crater. Baby, no! Can we go whale-watching, please? And where is that? In Akureyri. That's too far! That's like six hours. Babe, I thought this whole trip to Iceland was your gift to me? I know, but it's just too far. He says it's three hours away to get to the whale watching spot. -Three more hours? -Yup! My butt hurts already. Let's not go there. Given the instability of the weather conditions, and the fact that we've only traveled three out of six hours, means if we go on, that's another three hours. Apply Mutatis Mutandis... And the travel time heading back and that makes a grand total of nine hours. Babe... That was a mouthful. So what's your plan? Is there any nice place around the area? Seljavallalaug. -I know that! -Thank you! -No problem. -Thank you. I know that place, babe. Sejlalavelala. -It's the oldest pool in Iceland! -Pool? I read about it. I just can't pronounce it. It's a great idea! We should go! Maybe we'll see a puffin! Didn't I tell you I want to see a puffin? Those cute birds that only grow this high? Let's go then. Babe! We should take one home. I'll stuff her in my bag and we'll name her Mary. Mary Puffins. Or Imelda Puffins. "Dear Jen, they were right. Traveling together tests a relationship. This was our first trip out of the country. I must admit, sometimes you annoy me. Most of the time you piss me off. But I'll take it, because I love you." Babe, don't you want to go swimming? Babe, thank you. We visited all the places I wanted to go to today. Tomorrow, it's your call. Where do you want to go? It's up to you. How about that volcanic crater you've been wanting see? Anywhere's fine. Let's go there! Okay. Question. What's bigger than a crater? -What? -Cratest. Cratest! Crate. Crater. Cratest. Baby, you're my cratest love of all. Babe, let's start walking towards the crater. Let's go. Babe? Babe, you go without me. Anyway, you're the one who wants to see it. What? Yes. Just take some good pictures. Okay? And if they're great pictures, you'll get mad at me. Come on, let's go. Babe... I haven't showered yet! It's okay, you had a dip in the pool. I didn't, come on. Maybe that's why my head hurts so much. Come with me, babe. Okay fine, I'm coming. I'm coming. -I'm putting my shoes on. -You know what, forget it. -Let's not go. -I'm putting on my shoes. -Your head hurts. You should rest. -I know, but I'm coming with you. It's okay, forget it. -I'm coming already. -Forget it. Do you want me to come with you or not? -I want you to come with me. -Okay, then wait for me. Okay, I'll wait for you. Let's go. You go ahead. I need to pee. Let's look for a place to pee up there. Alright, I'm coming. Go ahead. It's okay, I'll wait. It's okay, I don't want to feel rushed. Nobody's rushing you. Go ahead. What's the point if we're not together? Are we joined at the hip or something? Wow! Jen, come over here. Look at that. Isn't it beautiful? It's alright? -Alright? -Yeah. Where's the camera? Let's take a picture right here. I didn't bring it. -Why not? -I didn't know we'd take pictures. And hello... What a tough climb. And it's not all that great. It wasn't worth it, babe. What a shame. Oh, well. Excuse me. Yes? Do you even know how much I paid to get here? And now I'm hearing you say this about Iceland? Excuse me? Do I know you? Jen, stop. There's a Filipino just like you in every corner of the world. Even all the way here in Iceland. If you don't want to bump into other Filipinos, then go to another planet. You want me to push you into a crater? -Jen, stop it. -Do you? Just trying to scare him. I'm in a bad mood, okay? -Why'd you pick a fight? -Why are you mad? It's unjust vexation. It was a rotten thing to say. It's beautiful here. -Well, why don't you two get together? -You're both in love with these craters. -What are you saying? -What was he saying? Oh, it's my fault now? You didn't need to pick a fight with the tourist. So it's wrong to be honest now? It really wasn't all that great. There's a time and a place for honesty. It was the time and the place for honesty. I'm extra honest when in Iceland. Is that wrong? You're mad at me. That's why you can't admit you're wrong. You shouldn't have come. I should've left you. That's right! I told you to leave me. You forced me to come! And now, it's my fault? "Tomorrow it's your call. Where do you want to go?" That's what you said. You liar. Okay. So I guess you don't love me anymore. You're fighting with me. You're so mean to me. It's like I can't do anything right! It's alright. Jen. I'm sorry. Knock, knock. What? Knock, knock joke! Are you serious? Yes! Knock, knock. Fine I'll throw you out and you knock, knock from out there. Baby, you're so mean to me... Do you want to go to Geysir? -And where might that be? -Geysir. Water that shoots up from the ground. Like this. Wait, let me see. "Geysir is one of the most famous geysers in the world, and the one that gave the phenomenon its name." See? We're here! Geysir will erupt any moment now. Any moment now. Let's wait. So we wait for the Geysir. Jen, there's nothing for us here. Just wait for it, babe. Let's just wait. But I'm tired. Let's just go. We've been going around in circles and I've been driving. We should've just followed Ring Road. Like we first planned. There's nothing happening here. Wait... Let's see what the book says. I don't know why you're being such a brat. Now where is that? Wait. Oh... It's not here anymore. It says here, "Due to the geological shifts in the earth, Geysir doesn't erupt regularly anymore." I didn't know that I didn't read that part. So going here was a waste of time? No, wait. I know there's one more... Here it is! Strokkur is here too. That one erupts every six to eight minutes. Let's not go, I'm tired. Babe, please. I'm sorry I didn't know that this one doesn't erupt. It won't take us long. -It won't? -It's close by. Are you sure? Never mind. I know that look on your face. You think I'm an idiot. I didn't say you were an idiot. You don't have to say it. You just give me that look. Your eyes are saying, "Jen, you're so stupid! I thought you said you knew Iceland?" How can I possibly know? It's my first time here! Jen... Relax. And don't you scream at me! Babe, it's beautiful! Wow! It's so beautiful! That was amazing, babe... Babe... I made Jen cry, ma. That's normal, son. You get to know each other better when you travel. But I do know her. We've been together for 13 years. This is different, Ben. Your patience will be tested. And you'll find out just how much you're willing to compromise for each other. Why should I apologize? It's not my fault. It's not important who's wrong. What's important is what's right. Dad! Jennifer... Apologizing doesn't mean you're weak. Even if it isn't your fault. It only means, you can't say no to him, because you love him that much. -Sorry, it's my fault. -Sorry, it's my fault. -Thanks for admitting it! -Thanks for admitting it! You made me cry. I said I was sorry. So are we good? Can I ever say no to you? No! Never. So are you good? Can I ever say no to you? I'm really sorry. It was my fault too. So now we can kiss... Ben! That's gross! Gross, seriously? Where do we go next? Let me check the map. What is wrong with this map? It's a total mess! What happened to it? Finally you admitted it! You're the total mess! What do you mean? Weren't you the one who said, "Babe, let's follow the Ring Road so we won't miss anything." Then you wanted to see the falls. You wanted to go whale watching. You wanted to try the pool. You even had the nerve to say, "I'll kill you if I miss the Aurora Borealis." But I couldn't wake you up for it! Then you tell me, "Tomorrow is your day. We'll go wherever you want." And when we were hiking, what happened? You weren't into it at all! You even pretended you had a headache! Make a U-turn here. Let's follow your Ring Road. Turn it around now. -No, it's okay. -Turn the car around, Ben. -Turn back. -It's okay! Turn the car around. -What's your problem? -Turn back! -Jen! -Turn this around! Babe! Babe! -Babe! -Jen? -Are you okay? -I'm fine. Wait. What did we hit? Shit. Nothing? It won't start. Why did you do that? What are we going to do now? How should I know? I'm no mechanic. Give me the phone. Yes, hello? We were in an accident. Yeah, we might need a mechanic Or a tow truck, please. Yeah. We just left Selfoss. Yeah. I'm on the phone! Yes. -What? -Look. We checked everything. The diesel tank is done. You hit something. We need to replace the diesel tank. The towing, everything will cost 3000 Euros. Three thousand Euros? Yeah. It is expensive. That's about 180,000 pesos. I'm sorry. Do you want a replacement car? No. We don't have money anymore. -I'm sorry to hear that. -It's okay. -Thank you -Thank you I'm sorry to hear that too. We won't get a new rental car? We have no money left. I'm going to pay. Did you tell Ben you're going with him to the U.S.? Not yet, Dad. He's in a bad mood. Wrong timing. Maybe I'll surprise him when we get home and I have the visa. He's here. Bye, Dad. See you soon. Love you. Love you too. Hi, babe. Remember this? Fire and Ice. Hot and cold. Complete opposites. Yup. Very unpredictable. Makes things exciting, doesn't it? It's not always good to be unpredictable. Sometimes it's better to be sure. And not keep changing your mind. But isn't that boring? Isn't unpredictable a lot better? You don't know what's gonna happen today or tomorrow. How much do you love me? Babe, what kind of question is that? Are you coming with me to America? What if tell you I'm not? What will you do? What if I insist and say, if you're not coming then I won't marry you? You won't do that. You can't do it because you can't live without me. Exactly. So you still won't come? Even if you know that I have to be wherever you are? You love me! You really do love me! Baby! Come on, babe, quick! Smile! What is this? Why are we doing this? That's how it goes! -Wait, I'm getting dizzy! -Enough, me too! We should be taking pictures of this and not just our faces. Why are you so grumpy? Babe! Over here! -Why? -This is it! -Not over there! -What is that? That is going to be the poster for our wedding! Because we did it all through night and day and we're still together! You forgot to click record, damn it Let's get something to eat. I'm starving. That restaurant serves lamb. I don't like lamb. Burger? Too heavy. Well, what do you want? Ice cream! I'm so cute! All I want is ice cream! You get your way again. Hold this. Let's go there. Ben. -Benjamin! -What? Why are you leaving me behind? I'm not, I said I don't want any. -Please? -No. -Please? -Babe, sorry! I'm eating. Do what you want. What's bothering you? Babe! -Everything okay? -Yes. We don't want to be late. It's 45 minutes to the airport. We can't miss the bus. You've got my passport, right? Nope. You have it. Seriously? -You don't have it? -I don't have it! Did you leave it in the room? Did I? I don't know. It's not here. Then go check the room. Babe, it's not there. I'll check again. Of all things, why lose your passport? You're so irresponsible. We'll miss our flight! Maybe it's here... That's so irresponsible. It's your passport! Hang on, babe, I'm looking! Instead of getting pissed at me, -help me... -I'm helping! It's not here... Let's go. Let's go. Are you happy? Except for the accident and missing our flight, yes. You? Are you happy? All I wanted was to give you... the most memorable trip of your life. Because I know that whenever I make you happy, I'm happy. But I'm not happy now. Why not? This trip was an eye-opener for me. It was like I was with a different Jen. A different Jen? Why? The Jen I know is considerate of how other people feel. She is sensitive, not wishy-washy. Now it's all different. It was so tough for me. Tough? We're not even married yet. When we're married, you'll need to understand me every single day. Are we going to fight everyday because you still don't get who I am? Maybe... Maybe we should postpone the wedding. Why don't you just leave me then? That's not what I'm saying. I just want... But that's where we're going anyway. That's how you see me. I'm inconsiderate. I'm a bad girlfriend. Ben... You're too much. You picked Iceland, of all places to tell me that you don't want to get married anymore? Really, while the sky is so pretty? When it's almost sunset? My favorite time of the day? See? It's always me who adjusts. You're not coming with me to New York, right? Our relationship is based on your happiness. On what you want and what's best for you, which is okay. It's what I want. But what about me? So you think I'm selfish? You think I'm a burden? Then I guess you're right. We should break up. We should break up! Okay. So you agree? That's what you want, you just said so. Okay. Fine. Let's do it. Let's break up. Go to America and look for the girl who can give you everything you need. Go and I'll stay here in my country! Not this country. This is not my country. I'm not home yet. I meant the Philippines! You ruined Iceland, Ben! You ruined everything! Jen! Jen! Jen! What do you want me to say? Just say something about your fiancée. She's very much like me. Or I'm very much like her. We have the same taste in music, arts, movies, even in food. We're very, very similar. And every time I look at her, I forget everything. See? I forgot everything. Ben always tells me I came at the perfect time. You did. She's all I see. She's my world. She's the only one I want to be with. What's important is the life I will be spending with her. Dad, look. Ben looks so happy there. How many times more will you watch that? Whoever that woman is that Ben is marrying, she's making him really, really happy. I made snacks, let's eat. I have news about Ben. He's coming home to sell their house and the bar. The bar, too? That's a shame. They're selling off all their properties. They won't be coming back to the Philippines. They'll stay in New York for good. How long was it since you last talked? Dad, there's nothing to talk about. You don't even talk to Grace anymore. Because it's awkward. Ben and I are broken up. I can't still be close to his mom. Maybe you and Ben need to talk. One last time. No. We each have our own lives to live. Look at him. He's moved on. Sir, opening and closing inventory figure accounts. Okay. When do we hand over to the new owners? Very soon. They're finalizing the contract. Are you sure you won't change your mind about staying in New York for good? It's always been the plan. What does Jen say? Is she okay now? Is she well? Dad? You have a visitor. Who? It's Ben. Tell him I'm not here. Or tell him I'm asleep. Tell him I don't want to see him. Jen. Your ears are still huge. Come, let's talk. You look good without hair. Really? You're my idol. So I copied your look. Why? I had brain surgery. A few months ago. A few weeks after we came back from Iceland. I would get frequent headaches. At first, I thought it was stress. Or maybe I was just heartbroken. That was a joke. So I ignored the headaches. The bar exam was close. Maybe that's why. During the second week of exams, I collapsed. They took me to the hospital. The MRI showed I had a tumor. The neurosurgeon said it was Astrocytoma. Benign. I said it was benign! Don't cry, Ben, it's okay. The doctor said it will grow big so they have to remove it. I said no. Why mess with my brain if it isn't cancer? But Dad begged me. So I had the surgery. Why didn't you tell me? Tell you? Why would I? We broke up. You broke up with me. I didn't want to be a burden like you said. Don't cry. It‘s not your fault. It's okay. You know what? I've got all these symptoms. They've been there all along, but we didn't know. I googled it. You know what the symptoms are? Headaches? Yes. Headaches... Memory loss... Changes in behavior... Irrationality. And you always need to pee. That's one of them. Actually, this is from a heartache. That was another joke. Welcome back! So that's why she was like that in Iceland. She was a different Jen. She was already sick then. You promised to take care of my daughter. That you'd love her. I'm sorry, Dad. But why didn't you call me? Jen was devastated when you broke up. She's accepted it now. She became happy for you. I'm trying to be happy for you, too. Because that's all she wants. Everything for you. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? Sorry for breaking your heart? Sorry that I left you. I didn't know you were sick. You mean if you knew, you wouldn't have broken up with me? No. I could have been more patient. Maybe then we would not have broken up. It's okay. We were on our way to that anyway. We would have broken up when we got back home. Or worse... We'd get married and then break up after. It's God's plan. Remember that video I was working on? -The Prenup? -Yes. Can I see it? I don't think so. Why not? I'm in it! No. You might fall in love with me again and leave Annie. Abi. Abi. Abi, Annie. It's all the same to me. Forgive me, I have a brain tumor. That's probably why I never passed the Bar. I have a BAR-ain tumor. Knock, knock. -I see you came prepared. -I have two more. -Knock, knock! -Who's there? -Tumor. -Tumor who? TUMOR-ow morning if you wake up... Oh, we're doing this, huh? -I saw Jen. -Oh, how is she? She's getting better. Are you okay? Yeah. I feel guilty. All these years, I didn't know she was sick. Are you still in love with her? It's okay, I understand. She's a big part of your life. Was. Hon, you've been together for years. She means a lot to you. Why don't you extend your stay there? No, I want to go home. No, she needs you. You weren't there for her all these years. You can stay a few more weeks. Until she fully recovers. You sure? You're okay with that? Of course I am. For all that she did for you. And I'm in love with the person you are now. I love you. I love you, too. Jennifer! Jennifer! -Hello! -Hi! Nice dress. Do you remember it? You were wearing that when I proposed. I want to show you something. -Will you marry me? -Yes! See that? You can tell you love me more than I love you. That's a rare thing. I'm so lucky you loved me that way. You're so beautiful in this one, Jen. Ben? Ben. What is this? Do you still find me pretty? Ben, you always wanted this. Now we can do it. Jen! I'll explain everything to God. He'll understand. No, Jen. Don't. Don't. You don't want me anymore. It's because I'm bald and ugly. Jen... You don't need a wig. You're already beautiful. Jen? Jen? Jen? Dad... Dad! I dozed off. What happened to Dad? What happened? -You fell asleep? -Yep. What's with the flowers? You're marrying someone else. Are you going after my daughter again? No malice here, Dad. I just know Jen loves flowers. Jen... How dare you show up here! After breaking up with me in Iceland? -Wait! -Why are you here? -What are you doing here? -Stop it! What are you doing here? I told you to stay there! This is my country! What are you doing here? -Sorry, Dad! -Jen! Get out! How many years was that? Stop it! I said stop it! Go take his side. You're both ugly! Dad, what was that? It was the surgery. It severely affected her memory. Sometimes she doesn't even recall what she just did. Or what she did a year ago. Hi, babe! You're here! I've been waiting for you. You want an orange? I'll peel one for you. Sorry... Ben... Why am I here? Are you proposing again? Don't, I'll make you a widower. We're going to sing. No, we're not. I don't want to. I know it's on your bucket list. -Come on. -There are too many people. Who cares? I own this place. I really can't. Come on. I'll be here with you. Okay? -No. -Come here. Don't be scared. I'll sing with you. Ben... Hey, quit that! Jen? Jen? Jen! There is a re-occurrence of the tumor. This triggered the sudden burst of abnormal electrical activity in her brain. She won't survive another operation. How often will this happen? I gave her an anxiolytic to help her relax. Dad, go get some rest. I'll take care of things here. I want to be with my daughter, Ben. You haven't eaten a thing. When she wakes up and finds out you haven't been taking care of yourself, we'll both be in trouble. Okay, I'll go. Hi. Hello. I miss my sunsets, Ben. Sunset... The color of the sky is so pretty. Are we allowed here? No. But you wanted to see the sunset. In Iceland. You really broke up with me in Iceland. You shouldn't have done that here. Couldn't you wait until we got back? Why? I was ready to do everything for you! I was going to America with you. Now you're leaving me for good. Why are you leaving me? Babe? Don't leave me. Jen, I'm here okay? It's okay. Babe? Babe... I'm ready. Ready? Ready for what? Tomorrow morning if you wake up And the sun does not appear I... I will be here If in the dark we lose sight of love Hold my hand and have no fear Cause I... I will be here I will be here When you feel like being quiet When you need to speak your mind I will listen And I will be here When the laughter turns to crying Through the winning, losing and trying We'll be together 'Cause I will be here Tomorrow morning if you wake up And the future is unclear I... I will be here As sure as seasons are made for change Our lifetimes are made for years So I... I will be here I will be here You can cry on my shoulder When the mirror tells us we're older I will hold you And I will be here To watch you grow in beauty And tell you all the things you are to me I will be here I will be true To the promise I have made To you and to the one Who gave you to me Just as sure as seasons Are made for change Our lifetimes are made for years I... I... I will be here We'll be together... The sky is so beautiful... I'm sorry I ruined sunsets for you. Stop that. You can never ruin sunsets for me. They're always so beautiful. You're like a sunset. Because I'm on my way out? Because you're always beautiful. Even if I am on my way out. I'm really sorry, Jen. I said, cut it out. You didn't ruin sunsets for me. So don't apologize. No... for everything. I'm sorry I gave up on us. I'm sorry I let that happen. I thought you would come after me. I thought we would get back together. I guess that's as far as we can go. But I'm happy. I'm happy for you and Abi. You look happy with her She's pretty. She seems like a kind person. Like she would never scream at you. Or pick a fight... I'm really so happy for you. And... I've forgiven you... for breaking my heart. I hope you've forgiven me too, for all my shortcomings... You're an ideal girlfriend. How ideal can I be? You moved on so quickly and replaced me with another girl. That's another joke. But thank you, Ben. Since we met, you've always taken care of me. Even now when you don't have to. That kind of love is rare. I don't regret loving you. You need something from me. You're trying to flatter me. No, Ben. I don't want anything more. You've given me everything I need. Thank you. Thank you for... for giving me the best 21 years of my life. Jen? Jen. Jen? Jen? If I were to live again, I'd still choose to love you. Even if this is as far as we go. Even if you hurt me again. Even if you break up with me at my favorite place. During my favorite time of the day. It's okay. Because I will love no one else but you. I love you so much, Ben. I want you to be happy. Though I'm no longer part of that happiness, even though we're not together. I'm so happy that you were part of my life.
