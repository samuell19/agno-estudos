" HEARTSTRINGS " One to zero. One to one. Damn it! Two to one. Two to two. - Hi Mom. - Hi love, Hi, Marlene. Hi my darling. Let me comb your hair. Did you take your meds? Your father is coming tonight to see us. Really? What is it? Don't you want to see him? I want to, but it's weird. He never comes during the week. Can I drop you off at school? No, thank you. I like to walk in the morning. - I don't need them! FOR RENT - What year were you born? - 2003 and you? - Me too. - That's cool! - But in what month? - December. - Really? Me too! What day? - The 22nd. - Really? - Swear. - What time? - I think at 3 in the morning. Me too! Seriously, how crazy! You's are silly. - Hi, how are you? - Good and how are you? Very well. It's been a long time, hasn't it? Yes, since yesterday. At least he went to talk to her. Who's talking to whom? - Do you want to sit next to me? - No. When will you talk to her? Talk to who? With Marie. Are you crazy? Why are you talking about Marie? Nothing doin'. It's March already. You better talk to her. Why are you standing? I'm not standing. Hello. I hope the holidays were good. Have you rested? Because, by the results of some of you in the last test, it's time to wake up. At least a little. Marie, 18. I just didn't give 20, so you can keep improving. But what's up with the handwriting? Be careful with that. Romain. 17. You just forgot the capital letters in proper names. There. "After the rain, the rain?" Oh really? Okay, 15. But this one... This one! It's wonderful. Victor? You never disappoint. You are a poet, you know? I'll even quote you. To the question "What is the climate in Nice?" You answered: "Nice's climate is polar, especially when it snows, especially when the tide is low. " I like you, Victor. Zero. Victor! When will it snow? - Idiot! - Dummy. Victor? Did you know that in 1992 there was a blizzard in Nice? Really? Really. Bye. What's this, stop it. Enough. No, no, no... There is no other solution! - Anyway, I already called. - Already? Yes, they are ready to receive it. Immediately. It doesn't get any better in Europe. It's close to here. I'm sure Dr. Vergne will agree. It's a hospital. I don't want Marie to study at a hospital. - We are not at that point. - It's not a hospital. It is an institute. Do you prefer to see her vegetating in this bad school? Her school is not bad. - And then there's the cello. - The cello... They're not related. It's her passion. - You can't deprive her of that. - Who talked about depriving? Who? Why couldn't she play at the institute? It is not the same. Here, she has the teacher, the conservatory. - The test is in June, - Yes right. I know she has a gift. We can make it happen there. How many musicians are successful-- and blind? Without a doubt it is the priority... - Stop, please! - I can talk to my daughter! It is not the best time. Ok. Whenever you want, Robert. At least call me a doctor when your parents are here. Okay, Dr. Robert. Very well. T. A. O. I mean, C. I saw it was C. P. F. U. Or is it D? E. S. T? F. U. D? Z. Florence, while I'm done here, accompany Marie's parents to the office? I'm finishing up. Make an appointment before Easter, before my vacation. Very well. It has progressed since the last time. - No? - It's true. Let's do another exercise. Try it. I. S. How did you know? You memorized the test, didn't you? You can fool your parents, but you can't fool me. Is it always like this or are they crises? They are crises. It's better now. - Do you wear glasses? - Everyday. It will get worse, Marie. From now on, crises will be stronger and more frequent. - I have to tell your parents. - No! I don't want to be stuck here! Not now! I am obliged to mention the degree of your illness. You are 12 years old, Marie. I'm responsible for you, understand? I know. I have something to do, it's very important. I need to finish the school year. I have no choice. I can't, I need to tell. So let me tell them. Me. - Promise? - Promise. - Did you study? - A lot. Victor, get your things and sit in the front, - But, Miss... - Come on! Very well. Fast! So you don't see Haicam's material. From now on, you sit here. You have half an hour. Thank you, Romain. Thank you, Marie. You're OK, Victor? Yes. Sorry, ma'am. Victor! Are you going to stay there all night? Let's go. Watch out, my dad is there. He's finishing his prayer. Sit down, Hi Victor. All right? What do you mean am I all right? About the test... I don't care about the test. Are you sure? Of course. Anyway, Marie likes you. Lay off. Enough of that. And how do you know that? I know everything. And I don't trust them. Women always hurt us. But in your case, she falls for you. It is from the bottom of the well that light is best appreciated. Stay tuned and take the opportunity. It will come to pass. I know. Wait, why did you do that? What? Friday, with the paper. Wait, why did you do that? I did it because everyone laughed at you and I'm always on the side of the oppressed. The oppressed? What is that? Are you kidding me? Not even a little. That's all? Is it just for that? Yes. See you later. So... I'll start by giving the Friday notes. Victor, You have nothing to say to me? You never passed the average and today you get 20? Get 20, take 20... And do you think I'll congratulate you without asking anything? You're caught, Victor. You're caught. Here, your paper... Why don't you want to start? What did I do to you? Give me a sign. Do you want to play with me? It is on purpose. You know I can't resist. Daddy! All right? How's school...? Everything is connected. Come on! And with you. One two three four! Cheating! Cheating, Victor! No, no! There can be no real satisfaction in cheating. Do you understand, Victor? - Understood? - I understand, sir. Just think of Lance Armstrong. Seven Tour de France wins and what does he have now besides shame? That's right! Watch out. You are risking losing your studies in mechanics. - Is that what you want? - No sir, You're riding the line, Victor. You better shape up. Can I go, sir? Go. Wait! You screwed me. How can I ever get good grades? Right. Sorry. I shouldn't have done that. - And wait. Since it is so, I could help you. How's that? Will you continue answering for me? No, but I can help you to study, to recover, maybe... And why would you do that? Because I have no friends. And why don't you have friends? Because.. Maybe I never needed them. Needed? Interested in, I don't know., It's the same thing. Your head is missing some screws. And who said I want to be your friend? Bye then. I said she was in love. Or she wants to be, still do not know. Why would she do that? I don't know. Girls are very complicated. I'm sorry, Victor. The history of cheating turned out to be worse. Sometimes I am complicated even when everything is simple. It would be a pleasure to help you study. What are you doing? What? Are you going to pass your exams now? Yes. And do you think this is normal? Yes. Right. It's Victor Serano. Wow, - Hi - Hello. Come on in. - Your house is chic. - Thanks. Your parents here? I live with my mother, but she is always traveling. She is an art buyer. My father is a commissioner... Commissioner? Is he a cop? No, he is an auctioneer. Come on, You live alone? No, Marléne takes care of me, Marlene? My nanny since I was a little girl. You will see, she is very cool. Do you have a nanny? Yeah... We will have to work. Where do you want to start? Whatever. What's the worst? Nothing is serious. Choose the subject you want and I'll be right back. Did you choose this one? Read it to me. "The Kalachnikov brothers were very..." The Kalachnikov brothers? They are the Karamazov brothers, Not Kalachnikov. Who are the Kalachnikov brothers? Time's up! Yeah right. I won't be able to do it without the chalk... Yes, you're done. - It's over. - That's right? - No. Very well, Victor. - That's right? - It is. The lung! The lung! The lung, I repeat! The lung! The lung. The lung! The lung? Gutenberg. Yes? What did Gutenberg invent? Do not know. The im... The imp... The printer! Your mother is beautiful, Thank you, I will tell her. How is yours? She died. My dad says she left, but she passed away. But it's been a long time. I was 5 years old. Do you think your love can run out? What is it? Nothing. Am I disturbing you? Nope. - Dad, tell me something. - Yes. How did you know that mom liked you? I don't know. I felt it, that's all. You mean you have no signs? Nothing visible? What for example? I don't know, that's why I asked. Sometimes their hair is like that in the front. And they start to stutter in Spanish. - Also... - You never know how to be serious! Here we go. So there are no signs? Signs of what? Still that? Enough. I'm sorry for earlier. With your mother, I remember not calling her for three days. On purpose. She called me to curse me out. This is clearly a sign. And when we were living together, she decides to paint the whole house, move the furniture, Then I understood that she was in love. But it is by looking. The look, Victor, is important. That's how we see if the woman is in love. But it's weird. What is strange? Dunno. You know, the look is the first chapter of a love story. You know that? And your mother had a look that would knock me down, It left me without any protection. Have you ever been in love? No. - You can tell your dad. - No. Is there a girl you saw... No. Between ugly and silly, you are more silly than ugly. If I'm a fool, I took it from you, It is what we do best in the family. That's right? It's not right? Yes it's right. - Aren't you sick of it? - Too much. And I see no use in these lines, in this y and x, on these charts and "Curbs" Curves. - Like music? - A bit. Who is your favorite musician? Mozart. I really like Mozart. Which piece in particular? Everything, I'm a fan. I like everything. I'll play a little bit for you. It's not Mozart, but it's beautiful. - Do you play too? - No. Thank you very much for the geometry class. If I can do something for you, some service... Please ask. Really. I will, ok. Marie, it's time, And don't forget your glasses. I don't need. - Need to go. - Where? - To the conservatory. - What is it? That's what the school of musicians is called. In June, I will take the test at the National Superior Conservatory. We'll make music and study. My dream is to be accepted. Like a sport college? Yes, yes. - Marie? - Yes? Will you be careful with Victor? Because? Are you jealous? No, he is my friend. SERANO FATHER AND SON MAINTENANCE AND RESTORATION OF OLD CARS - Hi. - Hi, Marie. - Hi, Marie. - I've never heard anything like it. - Don't just say things like that, please. - I am not kidding. - We have to go back. - Here we go. What did I say? Bye, lovebirds. You could have told me you were coming. I need to tell you something. It's very important. In fact, I will stay... - Hello sir. - How's that? Hello sir. Excuse me, Hi, little one. I think I'm gonna go. Bye. Your girlfriend is weird. Sometimes, she is a little flamboyant. - You know that carburetor, I don't know... - Marie! Excuse me, I was annoyed that you heard our noise. - But it's not noise. - Oh really? Swear. - I'm glad. Coming from you, then. - Why? Because you are a real musician and I can trust you. You were going to say something. Just now, you said you wanted to say something important. No. Actually, yes. I wanted to say that I am very happy to be friends. See you tomorrow, Watch out! Okay, you can go now. Thank you, Victor. "A seagull flying over the beach is like a child who gives up on dreams. And with flapping wings, it can make life a perpetual pleasure." He became Victor Hugo. - We lost him, - Really. Victor, your report card is a reflection of your poem. There is still a long way to go, but it is the best recovery of the quarter. Congratulations! Easy to improve when you start from zero. Brave enough to say that again asshole? Let go! What are... Sit down! Azra gave us detention on Saturday. Why didn't you say it was Romain who provoked me? I'm sorry, I didn't see anything. - You didn't have to act on it either. - True. But nobody steps on me. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. So, didn't you see him? I was thinking. You are always thinking. Ready. So, I don't stumble anymore, Are you staying here for the holidays? Mostly. I'm going to see my aunt at the hospital. And you? Nothing special. We talk later? Yes. In my hand. Her hand is in my hand. She took my hand. She did, not me. She took my hand, I felt shocks all over my body. Want candy? She loves me, man, I held it like this, like a dog. Other than that, aren't you in love? No, she helps me to study. That's all. And then? She gave me a kiss. Okay, on the cheek. Normal. And when do you get married? When I want to marry her. Will she travel on vacation? Yes, she is going to see her father and an aunt in the hospital. In fact, she would like to stay with me. But I said, "No, go see your aunt. Okay."” The family is important. Wait. Put that on. I don't understand. Are you Jewish or Muslim? Both. My father is a Muslim and my mother is Jewish, So we alternate. This week is Shabbat. Come on. Today, let us pray for those we love and are gone. Can we talk outside? At this point in the pathology, sincere cooperation from the patient is needed. And Marie is resisting. I can't express how much. But it is good that she resist, isn't it? Of course. Your daughter is incredible. Thank you very much, but that is not the point. I'm tired of this conversation. It needs to be addressed here, at the institute, as soon as possible. If there's no place for it, just say so. We'll look elsewhere. My daughter is sick. You understand? She is sick! - Calm down, please. - I won't calm down! Because I'm tired of waiting. My daughter is ill. They don't seem to notice! Do you really think so? Yes... Very well... Yes... Tell me what we will do. I can not say anything. Not today. How can you not? If doctors are unable to answer such simple things, what are you for? Marie is bad! We can't leave it like this! Clearly, she is not the only one who is ill. Are you laughing at my face? - Perhaps you need therapy? - Therapy? Therapy... Talk to her. Watch her live. The right time will appear. Hello? Hello? - Hi - Hi. It's ready? Almost. It's been a month and a half with my car. Aren't you a mechanic? I redid the entire transmission. And I dismantled the gearbox, I changed the gear. In about fifteen days, it will be ready. It's at the end. - Fifteen days? - More or less. It must be... Excuse me, - Hello? Hi - Hi. Victor, please? Victor? For you. Hi. Come with me. - Where are you? At the hospital? - Yes, in my aunt's room. She just left. They took her for tests. How is she? Well, thank you. Are you okay? Yes, fine. Are you rehearsing with the twins? No, they traveled. Who's laughing like that? My father's client. It looks like they're getting along. You think? When I get back, will it be like before? Like what? Will we continue to see each other? Why do you ask that? Because... Because I miss you. I need you, Victor. Me too. Dinner! Dinner! Sit down, Your plate. - Cheers. - Cheers. Who was the girl who was here? The owner of the car. And what's her name? I don't know. Eleonore Bonnavaud. Nice name, Eleonore. And isn't she your type? I don't know. Why would you ask that? Why don't you have a girlfriend? I told you this is none of your business. Are you going to stay alone forever? Sitting on the couch? Why do you keep Mom's things? - When your mother left... - Died! She didn't leave, she died! Why don't you ever say she died? What are we going to do now? Do you want to get her out of school 2 months before the end of the year? I don't know. How can we do it? - You never are, I... - You? Yes, please. Please what? 'I already feel pretty bad about leaving them, because I have no money.' Is that what you wanted to say? Please don't mix things up. It's crazy that we don't know what to do. You are not the only one concerned. I am too. Promise. Come on. We are almost there. - Almost where? - You will see. It's magic. What are you doing? It will be wonderful! I'll go alone. Bye. Funny. Are you dizzy? I can not. I can't, Victor! I... What's wrong with you? What happened? I can't move. I can not anymore. What happened? What happened? I have an eye disease. I'm going blind. I've known since I was little, but it's getting worse. I have troubles. Do not touch me! That's why I went after you. I needed someone to help me hide my illness. And why do you want to hide it? It's not your fault. Because of the test. If my father finds out, he'll put me in the institute and my life will end. Are you on good terms? My father is deaf, he doesn't know anything about music, - Why didn't you tell me anything? - I don't know, I didn't think. Leave me, everything will be fine. Leave! Get out of here! I don't want your pity! Leave me! Leave me alone. Everything's fine. Alright? Alright. Nothing falls from the sky. Enough of these... My sayings? Yeah, this sucks. It is as if you have the manual of life, but it is not so simple. For sure. Grain by grain the hen fills her belly. - What is it? - Nothing. Let's go. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44... - I'm sorry... - Enough, get out of here! Don't you understand? I don't want to talk to you. Go! - The one who... - Shut up! Marie, what are you doing here? - Is that you? - What do you mean 'Is that you'? I have business nearby. As your mother is not here, I came to work. It's a little bit my home still. Yes, it's your home when it suits you. You shouldn't even have the keys. Look how you talk to me. And why aren't you at school? - What happened? - Nothing. You fell. How did you fall? It's none of your business. Have you never fallen? Yes, sometimes. This is it: I will never go to your institute for the blind. Understood? Never! I will not go! I will pass the test and study music! It's happening! - And you don't decide that! - How can I not decide? I am your father! - Aren't you hungry? - What? - Aren't you going to eat? - No. Victor? Victor! Come here. What happened now? If it's so important to you, don't let it go. I do not know what you're talking about. She lied to me. Love without a lie is not love. Are you in love? No! I knew it. Are you unhappy? Me, unhappy? Who do you think I am? When are you going to fix your room? Not today. When you want. CLOTHING DONATION - You can count on me. - On us, Mr. Azra. On us, on us. If you notice anything, call me. Of course. - Marie? - Yes. This quote from Sir Winston Churchill makes you wonder what? Winston Churchill was born in 1874. Thank you. But that was not what I asked for. Start with the quote. Winston Churchill is certainly the most cited politician in history. Marie, can you read what I wrote on the board? It's not difficult, And me? Why don't you ask me about Churchill? He's my hero! I love Winston Churchill. - He is my friend. - What happened to you, Victor? Nothing, it's the truth. "It takes courage to get up and speak; but it also takes courage to sit and listen", Honestly, I don't know what Marie thinks, but Winston forgot to be a fool. Get out, Victor! But sir, just when I'm interested in class... Go talk about your interests to Mr. Azra! Go! - Way to go. - Shut up, idiot. I'm waiting, Marie. "It takes courage to get up and speak; but it also takes courage to sit and listen." I think it takes more courage to get up and talk than just sitting and listening. Of course you lied to me! Not telling the truth is lying! This is not the worst! The worst thing is that you wanted to use me! And this is abuse! And abandoning me in the woods after I almost drown, I do that? In the middle of the woods? Middle of the woods? What hypocrisy! What hypocrisy! Do you want me to say what you told me? “Get out of here!” You said get out of here. And when did you take my hand? What did you think I was? A labrador? No, no! It wasn't just that, Victor. I swear. I didn't think I would fall in love with you. Really? Is this how you see? Yes, but that was a month and a half ago. Now it's like this. It's genetic. It's called pigmentary retinosis. Wow. Sometimes it gets a little better, but on the whole, it's worse. That's also why I never had friends. I don't like pity. How long do we have? My test is on the 19th of June. And here we are. Five weeks, 42 days. - No, 35 days. - Yes, 35 days. It'll be enough. But can't you write anymore? Of course, you can't write anymore! Is very difficult. We need a solution, I need to learn your handwriting. Wait. Is it going to get worse? Yes. For example, I know that there are 108 steps from the school grid to the stairs. Or 64 steps from the living room door to the library door. So, when I'm blind, I'll be ready. Stop boasting and come and make a basket. Take it. Stop. Come on, Tony Parker was blindfolded. There's no reason not to. Come on, you can do it. Prepare. Shoot. I CAN NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE! Are you sure you don't want help? No, why? I'm doing fine. - Miss? - Yes, Haicam? It's time, children, Leave the material on the table. Hand over your tests. Thanks. Your test, please. Thanks. Marie. Thanks. Thanks, What's up, Victor? I think I have a headache, Miss. Give them to me. Thanks. Why suffer, Romain? Pardon? You know what I'm talking about. Victor, I wanted to talk to you. The dishes. Do you get along with Marie? Yes, why? Didn't you notice anything strange about her? No, nothing. And dessert. Thanks. But if you see something strange, you will tell me? Yes of course, - But there's nothing strange. - Go, we're done. Victor! Listen. I don't know what they're up to, but be careful. What? Do you think I'm dumb? In the middle, there is a beautiful woman, with her breasts sticking out. Sorry, but you asked. I'm just saying. What is the name of the painting? I can't read from here. - You are blind? - Funny. Azra. What else? Next to her, on the right, there's a man like me, - with a Colt-- - A Colt? A weapon, That's all? No, there are some guys piled on her feet. It seems that they suffered. There's one staring at her starving. The woman holds a flag. - A French flag? - Yes. And on the left is a man with a top hat and a rifle? - You know this? - Ok, this is it. Ready. Can you explain this to me? Uh, yes. In fact, it is a cubist interpretation. As if Caesar was integrating a Délacroix. Yes, very interesting. You are crazy. I will never succeed. I'm dead. If you go, it's really over. We need a miracle. - Yes, hello? - Hello? This is the Eastern Crimean Liberation Front. We put a bomb in the school. - A bomb, - What? Thank you sir. My mom is doing well. - What's it? - I don't know. - One what? Bomb alert? Everybody out! Get out! Everybody out! You are really crazy. I don't know if we can make it this long. Sorry, I know it's hard to look me in the eye. But if you want, I can stop looking. No, I'm looking at you. You don't see me, but I look at you. You're wrong, I look at you, but you don't know. - But if you want, I'll stop. - No! Keep looking at me. I like it when you look at me. I'll get my cello. Azra is watching you. Where? There, next to Romain. - Give me. Give me the ball. Wait, what are you doing? It's not possible. There's something wrong. She does not like him. He accompanies her like a dog. Why do you say that? It's not funny, go get it. Look, I'm not making it up. I'm sure you're crazy, Thanks. Anyway, I don't see anything. - Marie! Marie! - Marie! Marie! - Did you see that? - There's something wrong. - Marie? Can we talk? - Yes. See you later. I'm having a party at my place on Saturday and I wanted to invite you and Victor. - Both? - Yes. Thank you. Very kind. And I know where it is. We will. Thank you. - Thank you, Romain, - Until Saturday. Yes, until Saturday. You did very well to speak to me, Romain. - You're going too fast! - Take it easy. We will park there. - It's beautiful? - I've never seen anything so beautiful. Crazy. I... I wonder if that's how it's done. One day I read how to do it, in a dentist's magazine. But even with instructions, we sometimes get confused. No, that's the way it is done, Next year, you'll be at your music genius school and I... And you...? It would be much better if you didn't pass. But you always pass. You will get it. Next year, without you, I'm the one who goes blind. Even after everything you've done, will we stop seeing each other? It's not because I'm going to change schools that... - You're sure? - Of course. And now, we have to take advantage. Everything is good. We did it, Victor. Thanks to you, in two days, I will take the test. Even Romain came to apologize. Don't you understand? He invited us to a party at his house on Saturday. - Oh really? - Yes. Let me see. There's nothing written on the card! Nothing! Damnit! He will tell everyone! Even your parents! You're gonna go to the institute. I won't, no way! I will not go! I will not go! I'll be there at midnight. Right? - Right. See you. - It's soon. You did very well. And now what do we do? - Marie! - See you. Marie! Marie! I'm sorry, Marie! My daughter! Are you crazy? Damnit! We're off. I said at midnight! Where is she? - Every moment has... - Shut up! Shut up! Go. - Hold tight. - Watch your feet. - Calmly. - There. Stay calm. We've got this. Don't forget the sweets. Thank you, Haicam. You can be smart all your life and dumb in an instant. - Thank you. - Thanks. - See you guys. - Goodbye. This is where we rehearsed with Etienne and Marcel before. This will do? I don't see much, but it looks good. - You know what, Marie? If you play like that tomorrow, they won't accept you. It was horrible. Thank you, Victor. You're welcome. Good night, Victor. Good night, Marie. Marie? Marie, wake up. Take it. Do you want to go back? Really, Victor? You are burning. We need to go back. You are not well. - You're pale. - It's gonna be okay. It's just a cold or something. Nothing severe. But... I think it must be anxiety. It's anxiety. I guess. Hold my hand. It will do me good. I'll get medicine, otherwise you won't even be able to play. Damnit! This way. Victor? Hi Dad. Why didn't you say anything? She doesn't look well. Get out of the way! It's okay, my angel. Easy. I don't believe you. Wait, Victor. Call the hospital. Say we'll be here shortly. Father, today is the test. She can't miiss it. We can not show up. As it is, I doubt she can play. We can fix this. Otherwise, it would be a pity. - Sir! - Yes? I'm sorry. But you are a loser! - Pardon? - Or an old fool! It is not because she is deaf that the world should not hear her! Everyone should hear her! What? Enough! Get in the car! - You're ok? - I am. Will you come with us? Get in the car. Whoever plants the wind reaps a good slap. Follow them, Dad. I don't want to leave heru alone. I'm going to the hospital with her. What he is doing? I think you've changed his mind. What time is the test? At 11:30. Take it easy! And me? This is also thanks to you. Open the door. Go! Marie, she's a cellist. But she is very late! You can't do that to us. - Not now! - Let me take care of that. Take Marie. Madame, I will explain to you. You will understand. Marie! Marie! The cello. - Thanks. - Wait! Take one of these, What is? It... It will help you. Fast fast! I will explain something very simple. That girl is my daughter, my baby. She is sick and has to pass this test. Just look at the chart and see mental and musical health... Wait! You have one last candidate. Audition with her. Thanks. Thanks. - You're all right? - I don't know what Ezra gave me, but it did me very well. Thank you, Victor. My God! "HEARTSTRINGS" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
