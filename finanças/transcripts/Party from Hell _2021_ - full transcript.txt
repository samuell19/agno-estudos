(gentle music) (winds blowing) (ominous music) - John? John! (suspenseful music) John. (tense music) (dramatic music) (camera snaps) (camera whirs) (ominous music) (gentle music) - Gracie! Breakfast! Breakfast is in the toaster. Morning, sweetheart. - Morning. (toaster clacks) it's cold. - The toaster must be broken again. Throw it in the microwave. - Mom's secret recipe? - Morning, morning. - [both] morning. - [denise] the green tie. What's the occasion? - I got a meeting today with the attorneys About the new acquisition, And I want to look intimidating. But I can't get this thing to hold a knot. You want to help me with this, please? - Sorry, I got to get this email out this morning. - We're out of milk. - Maybe there are some granola bars. - You know what? I'll just get something from the caf. - Did you get the name of that party planner from tom? - Yeah, he sent me an email. Said it was stacey something. - Stacey davis. - That's it. Said she's great. - She's the best. That's why she's booked until the end of the year. Everyone I've talked to is either booked, Retired, or on vacation. And one of them had a yelp review that said That she was "the jenna maroney of party planners." - What does that even mean? - I don't know. And I don't want to find out. (josh chuckles) I do need to find someone today though, Or else your sister is gonna throw our relaunch party With her usual savoir faire. - Oh, you know, people like a beer keg and beanie weenies. - Not billionaires like peter mason, sweetheart. (hand knocking) - Hey. - Hey, good morning. How are you doing, miss a, mr. A? - Hey. - Hey, corey. Good morning. - Can corey and I study at the coffee grinder after school? - Yes, but be home for dinner, okay? - [josh] knock them dead, kiddo. Mwah. - Come on. (denise sighs) (gentle music) (water splashing) (keyboard clicking) (hand knocking) - Oh, you're a lifesaver. How did you know? - Josh called on his way to work. Said you had kind of a hectic morning. - Yeah, and the titanic kind of hit a fender bender On the way to the uk. (ashley chuckles) What did he call about? - Oh, he's just looking for the perfect Congratulations gift for you for the relaunch. I told him spa weekend with your sister-in-law, Best friend, business partner, aka me. - I haven't even thought about what I'm doing next week With everything going on. - Oh, you mean relaunching the app And try to save our company from imminent collapse? - I am. I thought an app connecting tutors And students remotely was a great idea. Socially conscious, bringing people together... - And now? - And now, I'm wondering if I should've just stuck With writing code for someone else's mobile game. - You don't mean that. Once we launched the new interface, It's gonna be smooth sailing. - Or, you know, at least back to the old familiar hurricane. (ashley laughs) - So I've been thinking about it, Maybe we don't need a big party the night of the relaunch. - We're not doing a keg and beanie weenies, ashley. Peter mason is coming. - I know that, denise. I'm just saying, if we keep it small, I can plan it. - And who's gonna help with that? I'm swamped with the relaunch, And josh is at work working on this new acquisition. - Most of my work is already done. I can keep it classy. You were at my wedding reception. Nary a beanie weenie in sight. - And neither were you for most of it. - 'cause it was a lame party. But it was classy as hell. You know it was. - I guess we don't have a choice at this point. - Yes! Okay, I'll handle all of it. You don't have to do a thing. You won't regret this. - Somehow, I already do. (gentle music) - You know, I don't think my mom's been To the grocery store in like a month. - Still pretty swamped at work, huh? - Yeah, they relaunch the app next week. - I kinda like the old interface. It was good for meeting chicks. - You know, we've been going To school together for two years. If you wanted to meet me, You just could've walked across the quad. - It's too easy. Besides, it's kinda hot dating my math tutor. - Well, I hope rutledge university likes Your math tutor as much as you do. - Still no word? Hey. They're gonna want you. - What if they don't? My parents met at rutledge. It's all they ever talk about. What if I don't get in? - Baby, then we'll change our names, Learn spanish, elope to costa rica, Have eight kids, and live on the beach. - Should I be disturbed that you have Such a specific plan for us? - I've been thinking about this a long time. I was never gonna get into rutledge. But nothing's gonna keep you from getting in. They'd have to tie you up and try to drag you away Just to keep you from getting in, and you'd still make it. - You're the best. (grace chuckles) (tires screeching) (car thuds) - Oh, for christ's sake. (denise sighs) - I'm so sorry. I was texting and driving. (denise sighs) - I can't even be mad at it because, technically, so was I. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. And honestly, this looks fine too. - Are you sure? - No. But if my car explodes on the way home, I'll know who to blame. - Well, here's my card, in case you want to keep in touch. Molly cole, premiere party planning. What? (denise chuckles) - You're a party planner? - Well, I just moved into town. - That explains it. Denise allen. I am in desperate need of a party planner. - Seriously? - Yeah. We're having a big event at my work, And we're really up against it right now. - A last minute soiree. That's my specialty.

(cellphone beeps) (tone rings) Hi. This is molly. - Hi, molly. Do you remember me? Denise allen? I told you, it's not like that. (ashley chuckles) - And I told you, just saying "it's not like that" Doesn't mean it isn't exactly like that. You hired a party planner, For my party, that I'm planning. - As I told her, and I'm telling you, I would love for the two of you to work on it together. - Okay. After you. (bell jingling) (ominous music) Wow. Clearly, this office is brimming with clients. (ashley chuckles) - I work by appointment only. It helps my clients achieve their vision If they're not distracted. - Good idea. - Well, thank you so much for seeing us. Molly, this is ashley, our chief creative officer. Ashley, molly. - Hi. - I'm looking forward to working with you. I'm a much better party planner than I am a driver. (denise laughs) (molly laughs) - What? - I'll fill you in later. (denise chuckles) - Ladies, come have a seat. - Thank you. - Ashley, why don't you take molly Through what we've been working on? - Okay. Well, we don't have a lot of time, So I thought we should keep it simple. We can have the party in the office. I was thinking we'd grab appetizers From the restaurant in our building, And then set it up buffet style. Boom, we're good to go. - I was thinking something more sophisticated. - Well, I wouldn't say it's unsophisticated. - Well, what did you have in mind? - Well, I'd have to see the space. But I was thinking champagne, dj, passed hors d'oeuvres, Maybe a signature cocktail. Something elegant. - We only have a week. - That's plenty of time. I can come by tomorrow and get acquainted with the space. - Oh, I... Great. - That all sounds perfect. - I'll get started. - Thank you, molly. Get in touch with ashley if you have any questions. - I will. Have a nice day, ladies. (bell jingling) (door closes) - Did you pack? - Yep. Heading out first thing tomorrow morning, So I'll be back in time for the party. Which brings up... I talked to my sister today, And apparently you've shattered all her hopes and dreams? - I might have slightly chipped at one of them. - Well, you know ashley. It'll all blow over. - I hope so. With everything going on, I can't afford to have any distractions. (grace shrieks) What was that? - Oh, my gosh. (grace shrieks) - What? - I got an interview. I got an interview at rutledge. - [denise] congratulations, sweetheart. - Almost gave us a heart attack. - I have to call corey. (both chuckling) Corey? Guess who's interviewing at rutledge. - Liam, please make a note on my calendar, Grace has her rutledge interview, Wednesday at four. - She got her interview. Good! Oh, there was one more thing That I wanted to talk to you about. - Yeah. Come to my office. She's very excited. And very nervous. - And very smart. She's gonna do great. Peter mason's office called. They want me to remind you that he has A severe peanut allergy, so no peanut products at the party. - Got it. Was there something else? - I was wondering if you gave any thought To the discussion we had last week. - I have. Take a seat. Liam, you have been doing great work. But there's just no money In the budget right now for a raise. And with the relaunch, everyone is on overtime, And revenues are down. - I understand. I'm just trying to keep up with the bills, And student loans have increased. - Again? - Yeah. I'm sorry, I love working for you, But I may have to find another job that pays better. - Oh, man. Look, I'll tell you what, Stick it out with me till next quarter. If the relaunch goes well, we'll be back on track, And I'll make sure you get paid what you're worth. - I don't want to leave you high and dry With what's going on right now, So I'll stick it out with you. - Thank you, liam. I promise I'll do my best To make sure that you're glad that you did. - Thank you. And your 9:30 is here. - Oh. Okay. You're early. - I was just looking around. Quite an impressive operation you have here. - Yeah, well, it keeps us busy. (denise chuckles) (molly gasps) - Oh. Is this your daughter? - Grace. She's 17. - She is beautiful. - Smart as a whip too. She has an interview with rutledge on Wednesday. - That's a good school. - Yeah, it's been her dream since she was little. Her father and I met there, actually. - [molly] a family tradition. (molly chuckles) - Come, let me show you to ashley's office. She's gonna be giving you the tour. - Actually, do you have a minute? - Sure. What's up? - I hope I'm wrong. But I thought I noticed some tension with ashley In my office the other day. - Yeah. She had a little bit of hesitation About bringing on a party planner. I think she was hurt by it, actually. It's just... - I get it. You're stuck between hurting her feelings And impressing a billionaire. - Mm-hm. - Tell you what, why don't you let me handle ashley? - She's a lot to handle. - You want a lot to handle? Try planning back-to-back weddings for twin bridezillas Who are trying to one-up each other. (molly chuckles) Trust me, I've been doing this my whole life. I used to plan surprise birthday parties For my friends when I was a kid. This is what I do. - Oh, man, I used to love surprise parties When I was little. Now, surprises are usually bad news. (molly laughs) Speaking of the party, I emailed you the guest list. And I was able to get in touch With most of them to give them a heads up, But there were still a few that I couldn't get ahold of. - Mm. - And we just got a call That our guest of honor has a severe peanut allergy. - Mm. No peanuts in the catering. Got it. - Oh, molly. I need to get your w-9 so we can get you paid. - I'll make sure I send that over. - Thank you. - Molly. Molly. - There you are. I thought I missed you. - I've been here since six. Been looking for you. - Well, I had to check in with denise on a few things. - I thought she said to check in with me. - That's why I'm here. These are a few of the restaurants I thought you might like for catering. Thought you might want to take a look. Just set up a tasting for us in the next day or two And shoot me a text letting me know. - Don't worry. I won't forget to include you. That would be rude. Is there anything else? - No, that's it. - Come on. I'll give you a tour. (crickets chirping) - [corey] thank you. - Hey. What are you guys doing? - Well, I heard someone keeps forgetting to get groceries. - Not again. - So I picked up a few things, And decided to stay and make dinner. - Oh. Thank you, ashley. Love you. - Grab a seat, miss a. Dinner's ready. - Don't mind if I do. Did you hear back from jon or amber about the party? - Mm-mm. - I haven't heard back from any of the old gang. - "old gang"? - I have friends, I'll have you know. When I wasn't working 24 hours a day, I would see them sometimes. - So 2006? (hand taps) (ashley laughs) - I don't know, it's just so strange. It's not like them not to get back in touch. You think something's going on? - Maybe they jetted off on another one Of their impromptu euro trips for their anniversary. - Maybe. Did you connect with molly? - I did. Thanks letting me know she was there, by the way. - She just dropped in on me. - Like an anvil. Have you met this woman, grace? - No. - Picture a disney villain. (ashley groans) (grace laughs) (ashley laughs) - Speaking of the party, how are the plans coming? - Good. We did the walkthrough today, And I called and placed the food order this afternoon. Tasting Monday, four o'clock. And I invited peter. - Oh, good. - Yeah, he's in the office for a meeting with finance, I figured we might as well feed him while he's there. - Mm. And did you talk to molly? - Of course. - You did? - No. - Oh, goodness. - La passade, food tasting at our office, Monday, four o'clock. Should I also let her know to go to hell? - Ashley... - You're right, she'll find her way home on her own. Let's eat. (ominous music) - Hi, this is ashley allen. Yes, I have a tasting on Monday. That's the one. I'm so sorry, I just wanted to double check my order, Could you read it back to me? Is it too late to make one change? Great. (elegant music) - Hello, peter. - Hello, ladies. - Thank you so much for joining us today. So we're just waiting for qa to sign off, And then we're on track for the relaunch By the end of the week. - Our programmers have been working Around the clock for the last three months. - Well, it certainly looks like You've been spending my seven million well. I have to say, I am impressed. How is the new interface looking? - If I'm being completely honest, it's brilliant. Simple, sleek, sexy. It's gonna put us right back on the growth track. - Simple, sleek, and sexy. Happy to hear it. I hope you manage to turn things around here, ladies. I really do. - Absolutely. We are confident that this new interface Will put pupil in the top 10. - I look forward to seeing it. - They're ready for you upstairs now. - Thank you, liam. Shall we? - After you, ladies. (gentle music) It looks like we're just in time. - Molly, this is peter mason. Peter, molly cole, our party planner. - How do you do? - It's an honor to meet you. - Thank you so much. - I'm a huge fan of your philanthropic work With arts education. - Thank you. The arts and humanities remind us what it means to be human, Which is easy to forget in this day of tech. We become so obsessed with what we can achieve, We forget to consider what we should achieve Or what we're here to achieve. I should write that down. (both laughing) - I guess I'm lucky to be a party planner. I don't have to think too hard about that. - Just something for everyone to think about Because "beauty will save the world." - Dostoevsky. - Very good. - I could've benefited from a little more beauty When I was in school. - Well, there's no shortage now. - We should probably get started before the food gets cold. - Thank you for indulging my dime-store philosophizing. The floor is yours. - Thank you. Well, speaking of beautiful, This menu looks absolutely amazing. First up, we have the cocoa-rubbed rib eye bites With sun-dried tomato butter. - Mm. That's good. - Good? I want to marry it. (molly chuckles) Here, have another. - Next up, we have the orange glazed chicken skewers With fresh rosemary and tomato. - I've never had anything like it. - It's unique, isn't it? - Mm-hm. - Tastes a little funny all of a sudden. - Oh, that's just the seasoning. - Seasoning? Okay. - [ashley] and my favorite is the green apple cheddar tarts. - Another home run. - [denise] it possible to do modifications, Or is the menu the menu? - [ashley] they seemed flexible. We should let them know today if we want to make Any changes so they could place orders To their suppliers. (peter wheezing) - Peter? - We can swap it out for- (peter coughing) - Peter... (body thuds) (peter coughing) He's having an allergic reaction. What's in this food? - Nothing! I just ordered off the menu! - I need an ambulance, right away, To 4200 belmont, eighth floor. (siren wailing) (water splashing) - How is he? - He's stable. (ashley sighs) They're gonna release him tomorrow. Did you tell the restaurant about his peanut allergy? - How could I? I didn't know. What? (molly sighs) - Ashley, I told you about it. - What are you talking about? You never said anything. - The day we did the walkthrough? I read you the note. And you put it in your binder. - What note? I never saw any note. - Listen, this is my fault. I should've reminded you again- - Molly, you can go. - Denise, I- - thank you. (molly sighs) - I swear, I never saw the note. - Oh, okay. So I'm supposed to tell our biggest investor That we didn't almost kill him? - Denise- - stop. - I'm telling you, I didn't see the note! - Ashley, stop. Enough. I'm so tired of listening to you explain How nothing is ever your fault. - What are you talking about? - The new interface was your idea. We had a popular app, sales were growing, But you couldn't leave well enough alone. Your new design tanks, And it's everybody else's fault but yours. - That's not fair, denise. - You think that's not fair? We could be having this conversation At the morgue right now, ashley. Forget about our business, Your screw-up could've cost someone his life. - Guess we know what kind of day she's having. - Well, things have been kind of tense around here lately. What happened? - Oh, there was a mix-up With the catering. Must've triggered an allergy attack. He's recovering. - Well, I hope he doesn't pull his funding. - I love that shirt. - Thank you. - Hey, can I get on denise's calendar for early next week? - I'll trade you. - Trade me? - I'll get you on denise's calendar if you give me your w-9. - I forgot to send it again. - Mm-hm. Let me print it for you. - Great. Working on some scheduling? - Looks like we have a half-hour on Monday at 2:30. - It looks like we do. It's all yours. - Thank you so much. - W-9? Accounting is all in my grill about it. Looks like everything is filled out, Except for your employee identification number. - Pen? Thank you. Hi, I'm so embarrassed to be doing this, But I have an interview at Wednesday at 3:30 p.M., And I forgot the name of my interviewer. Yes, I'm grace allen. Anna carr? Great. Hey, anna. - Hi. (bag thuds) (body thuds) - I know I'm supposed to say I know exactly what I want to do, And exactly how I'm going to get there, But the truth is, I don't have everything figured out. But I know that I want to figure it out at rutledge. How was that? - Perfect. You're gonna kill this interview. - You're about to eat it for dinner. Let's go. (grace chuckles) - Do you have your suit? - Yup. I picked it up from the dry cleaner's today. Can I borrow your black pumps? - Of course. - Oh, and corey's gonna take me to the interview. - Oh. Do you know how to get there? It's a little tricky on campus. - Actually, she called and moved it to the coffee grinder. I guess their office is closed for electrical work. - What? What's wrong? - I didn't ask, mom. - You ready? - [grace] I think so. - Actually, there's one more thing. - What? (grace chuckles) (gentle music) Mom... It's beautiful. - My mom gave it to me when I graduated high school. I know it's a little early, But I thought you could use A good luck charm for your interview. - I love it. (denise chuckles) - Okay. Now, you're ready. (denise chuckles) - Really, really want to get in, mom. - Sweetie, I know. You've worked so hard. And your dad and I are very proud. - What if they don't like me? - How could they not? - Come on, babe. You don't want to be late. - I'll pick you up at five. - [grace] thanks, mom. (ominous music) - Grace? - Hi. - Anna carr. So nice to meet you. So tell me what makes you think You'd be a good fit for rutledge. - Well, I spent the past year as a volunteer, Tutoring through my mom's app. - That sounds very fulfilling. - It's a chance to help kids Who might not be able to afford a tutor, And to spend some time helping my mom with beta testing. - Is that what you want to do? Something like your mom? - Mm-hm. I'm definitely interested in programming. But I'm not completely sure. I guess most of my classmates would say They know exactly what they want to do, And how they're going to do it, But, the truth is, I don't have everything figured out. But I know that I want to figure it out at rutledge. - Well... 3.8 gpa. Good test scores. Lots of extracurriculars. - I couldn't decide between yearbook And newspaper this year, so I did both. - Well, on paper, you seem like an ideal fit for rutledge. Mm-hm. So I don't really know What's happening here in your interview. - I'm sorry, I don't understand- - So you spent a few hours a week working with kids Who can't get a real tutor? You think that makes you interesting? - I don't- - You don't know what you want to do. You don't know who you want to be. What, you're expecting us to figure that out for you? - No, I- - Rutledge recruits from the best schools in the country. What makes you think you belong there with them? I don't really see you as rutledge material. There are a lot of good schools That might be a better fit for your qualifications. Have you looked at state? Well, best of luck wherever you end up. - Thank you. - Hey, sweetheart. So how did it go? - Good. Really good. - What did they ask you? Did they tell you when you'd find out? - Mom, I'm super tired. Can we just go home? - Of course. Let's go. (gentle music) (hand knocking) Oh, hey. - Hey. Just checking in today after everything. - "everything" has been stuck in her office For the past few days. It's my fault. I went off on her. - You had good reason to be upset. It could've been so much worse. - I know, that's what I keep telling ashley. It just frustrates me That she won't accept responsibility for anything. She nearly killed a guy, And she wants to blame it on the caterer. I really need to talk to her Before we give the presentation at the party. - That's actually the real reason I came by. I wonder if it might be best if ashley skipped the party. - What? She can't skip the party. She's been working on this new interface for months. - Look at the big picture here, denise. You want to keep the focus on the new interface, Not the drama in the office. - Where is this coming from, molly? Did ashley say something to you? - I don't want to breach any confidences. But try to see it from her perspective. If you'd made a mistake like this, Would you want to stand up there, in front of everyone, Next to the man you almost killed? - I mean, I guess I could give the presentation myself, But it just feels so wrong 'cause so much of this is her work. - Trust me, it's better this way. - Should I talk to her? - Why don't you let me handle it? I think some feelings are still a little tender. Talk to her after the party, Once you're both done with the stress of the launch. - Okay. That's a good idea. - I'll come by tomorrow and we can get started setting up. - Great. Thank you, molly. I don't know what I would do without you. - You'll never need to find out. (ominous music) I hear you got in trouble. - It's not a joke, molly. Peter could've died. Thanks for the restaurant recommendation. - About that, I need you to take a step back from the party. - Um, no. - It's not a request. I'm telling you. - That's funny, I have some words That I'd like to say to you too. - I won't be needing your help anymore. - We'll see what denise has to say about it. - Denise is the one who told me. She doesn't want you near the party planning. She doesn't want you near the party. She doesn't want you. Period. - I don't believe you. - Go ask her, if you want to embarrass yourself further. You think you can tank her app, Try to kill her biggest investor, And she's just going to look the other way? She's done with you. - Fine. If this stupid party means that much to you, You can have it. - Mm, great. I'll call the restaurant and let them know They'll be dealing with me from now on. (molly chuckles) (door opens) (molly sighs) I love party planning. (door closes) (cellphone beeps) - Hi, this is ashley allen. I need to talk to someone about my catering order. Mm, no, no, in person, immediately. - [liam] hey. - [molly] liam. Hi. - I'll make this quick. Well, there's a problem with Your employee identification number. It's not in the database. - I must've written it down wrong. - Oh. No problem. I just need you to fill it out again. - Oh. Actually, I am running late- - Molly, we need it before the party. (birds chirping) - Interesting topic? - I guess so. Why? - 'cause you've been on that same page for half an hour. - What difference does it make? - [josh] hey. - Hey, daddy. - Hey, you made it. - Yeah. In time for the party, as promised. (denise chuckles) Though I hear that we might have to have a second party. - [denise] oh! Look at that. - I heard the interview went well. Put it on! - I have to go study. (denise sighs) - Honey... What was that about? - I don't know. She's been in a mood since the interview. She won't talk to me. - Oh. Well, maybe ashley can try. She always gets her to open up. - Let's just give her some space. How did the trip go? - Well, we closed the deal. - No way! - Yeah! - Honey, that's great! - We're gonna knock off a little early tomorrow And go to hallihan's to celebrate. And you are coming. - We got to set up for the party tomorrow. - Oh, right. Of course. - But we'll celebrate. I promise. - Yeah, after the relaunch. - Yeah. - I know. Okay, well, I'm gonna go unpack. - Ashley, what brings you by? - Just wanted to follow up on our conversation from earlier. - There's nothing to talk about. - Oh, I think there is something to talk about, molly. See, I'm going to the party. And you, you're going to jail. - Jail? Now I know why you're the chief creative officer. You have quite the imagination. - I went to the restaurant. They told me the strangest thing. They don't use peanut oil. Except that I made a special request When I called back the night before. You never told me about peter's allergy, molly. You called the restaurant, and then tried to pin it on me. - Why would I do that? - That's what I can't figure out. But I don't have to. I'll leave that to the police. Just wanted to see that smug look wiped off your face first. - Ashley, wait! You're right. But it's not what you think. Please, I know you're angry, but there's more to the story. - I'm sure the police will be interested To hear all about it. - Please, there's something I need to show you. Just wait. - Oh, my god. Amber? Oh, my god. (ashley gasping) (cellphone clicking) (cellphone buzzes) (cellphone beeps) (ominous music) (cellphone clicking) (molly chuckles) (cellphone chimes) (cellphone clicking) (cellphone chimes) - I have a hard time with her Because she's just so difficult and she... - [delivery man] standard delivery, ma'am. (pen scratching) - Thank you. The party supplies have started to arrive. - Perfect. I can't wait to get finished setting up. - I think we might actually pull this off. My husband and his colleagues are meeting at hallihan's, So I wanted to surprise him and catch the tail end. We have hardly spent any time together The past couple of months. I've been so busy working, and he's been traveling. So it's going to be tight. - Well, I will let you get back to it. - Thanks, molly. - To the american automobile industry.

You're two hours late. - Don't turn this around on me. - Yeah, you! Because it's always about you. You starting your app. You tanking your app. You relaunching your app. Yeah, I've been there every step of the way for you, And you can't spare one hour For one of the biggest days of my career. - Looks like you don't need me anyway. - Well, looks like you don't need me At your party either tomorrow. - Forget it. You're not invited. - Denise! - Ready? - Go. (denise sighs) success. - And we'll have streamers and balloons when we go live. - And better yet, it will be over. This was a nightmare to set up, so please make sure No one messes it up tomorrow. - Absolutely. (liam chuckles) - Well, we better get this back up. - Is everything okay? - Not really. But I don't want to talk about it. - Well, if you change your mind... - Thanks, liam. Why don't you take off? - You sure? I did want to get a couple more hours in driving tonight. - I'm so sorry you had to take a side hustle. - It is what it is. At least I get to see very interesting, very drunk people. (both laughing) - Oh! I promise, when this takes off, we'll talk about your raise. - Thank you, denise. - No, thank you. Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (gentle music) (crickets chirping) (keyboard clicking) (denise sighs) (ominous music) (denise sighs) (denise sighs) (switch clicks) (coffee splashing) (table thuds) (shoe scrapes) - Hello? Hello? Who's there? - Denise. (denise yelps) - Liam. I thought you left already. - Forgot my thermos. You want me to walk you down? - I was gonna do some more work, but... Yeah, let me get my bag. - Okay. Did you want me to set the alarm? - No, they're coming to set up tomorrow. I don't want anyone to accidentally set it off. - Okay. (molly sighs) (drawer rattling) (letter opener rasps) (molly chuckles) (lock clicking) (lock clacks) (drawer closes) (papers ripping) (molly screams) (keyboard clicking) - So you ready to talk? - I have nothing to say to you. - [josh] denise... - And there's nothing I want to hear from you. - This is ridiculous. - Don't start a fight right now. I don't want grace to know. - Good morning. - [denise] morning, sweetheart. - Are you excited about tonight? Daddy, what time are we leaving? - Your dad's not coming. - Something came up at work. - Dad, this is mom's big night. You can't just miss it. - It's fine. (keyboard clicking) Come on, I'll drive you to school. - But I haven't had breakfast yet. - Pick you up something on the way. - Okay... Just let me grab my backpack. - Tell her I'm in the car. - Denise. - I want you gone by the time I get home. (hand slaps) - I need you to make sure That the catering is a hundred percent. - Yeah, no problem. - Okay. Thank you. (ominous music) - Molly. Molly. - Liam. I have to go check on the music. - [liam] I still don't have your paperwork. - I emailed it to you. - No, you didn't. Here, I have the form on my desk. (molly sighs) It was just here. Look, I need the form today, Or else I'm gonna have to let accounting know. - Liam, I have to do the sound check. Check your email again. (molly sighs) So, what do you think? - What's that? Oh. It looks great. Perfect. I'm sorry, I just want this all to be over with already. - Is everything all right? - No, not really. Ashley's not answering her phone. And she left me a voicemail, but I can't get ahold of her. - [molly] when was this? - Two days ago. Sounded important, but I haven't heard from her since. And as far as I know, no one else has either. - Well, she was pretty upset. Maybe she just needs some space. She'll come back around. Listen, I have to do my w-9. - Oh, liam said something about that. He said it would be on his desk. - Oh. Would you mind? Because I really need to get this done, And I don't want to dig through his things. - Of course. He said it would be on his desk. Huh, that's strange, He said it would be right here on his desk. - Maybe it fell on the floor. - Oh. Maybe. (denise sighs) When liam gets into the office, Have him come to my office immediately. - [man] okay. I'll let him know. - Molly, excuse me. (denise sighs) (keyboard clicking) (denise sighs) (hand knocking) - was that molly? - Come in, liam. Close the door. - I'm having trouble trying to get her paperwork from her. I think something's wrong. - So do I. - What is this? - It's our corporate card statement, With thousands of dollars in cash advances from last night. - What? - Did you think I wouldn't find out about this? - Wait, you think I had something to do with this? - Maybe you want to tell me what you were doing With the card that was locked in my desk. - Denise, I didn't take your card. - Liam, I found it, in your bag, under your desk. - What were you doing in my bag? - Don't try to turn this around. You were stealing from us. I knew you needed money, But I didn't think you would do something like this. - Denise, I didn't take your card. - You're fired. - Denise! - You're fired. Pack up your things. Just be grateful that I didn't call the police. - Denise. Is everything all right? - No. Everything's not all right. But I don't have time to worry about it right now. I got to go home and get changed And I have to pick up gracie. - Your daughter? Why? - She's coming to the party. - Do you really want to put your daughter through that? Four hours of canapes and small talk? - She's excited about it, or at least she was. She's been in a mood since her college interview last week. - Maybe she just needs a little time to herself. - Well, she's spent the past few days in her room With nothing but time to herself. I'm hoping that this will get her out Of her head for a few hours. - Still... (cellphone buzzes) - oh, it's her. I'll see you tonight. Hi, sweetheart. I'm coming. (molly sighs) - Wait, so there's gonna be a billionaire at the party? - Yeah. Peter mason. He was on the ground floor Of like six social media companies. - Wow. So, what, you gonna follow in his footsteps? - Can't even get into rutledge, I am not gonna be a billionaire. - Did you tell your parents yet? - I don't know how to. - Grace, it's one school. - It's not just one school, corey, it's rutledge. You wouldn't understand. You're taking over your dad's business, You don't even want to go to college. - Wow. - You know that's not what I meant. Look, I'm sorry, can we just... Can we not talk about this right now? I don't want to ruin tonight. - [denise] gracie? Are you guys ready? - Be right out! - Come here. Whatever happens, you're gonna be fine. - Promise? - I promise. - You liar! (grace chuckles) - You look nice. - What are you doing in here? - I'm not leaving until we've had a chance to talk. Why don't I just come to the party? - Josh, I'm at my limit right now, I can't do this. (somber music) - Honey... Denise, just talk to me. - You look amazing, babe. - Oh, you're so sweet. I'm so excited. - Denise, just wait. Wait a minute. Please. - Grace, you look beautiful. - Oh, thanks! So do you. - Here, let me grab a photo of the family, you guys. - No, corey, that's fine. - What are you saying? We have to remember this! Come on. - All right, squeeze in a little tighter, you guys. Or this is fine. (camera snaps) Got it. - Dad, are you sure you can't come? - Next time, beautiful, okay? - We'd better get going. - Okay. - Have fun, guys. (upbeat music) (people cheering) - Oh, wow. Should relaunch the app more often, miss a. - Never again, corey. (denise chuckles) - or never again. - This is great, mom. I'm so proud of you. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Are those the hors d'oeuvres? (denise chuckles) - Go enjoy yourselves. (denise sighs) - So he said, "but I was just reading the book." I said, "well, they're here somewhere." He said, "yeah, and I'm looking all over." And they were right on his head the whole time. Yeah, it was funny if you were there. - Peter, it is so good to see you again. - I guess that wasn't a given The last time I left your office, huh? - I promise there is not a peanut Within a thousand feet of this building. (peter laughs) - I think I'll stick to champagne this time, just in case. - Again, we are so sorry. - Yes, so I gathered from the forest Of flowers in my hospital room. Which reminds me, where is ashley? I want to thank her. It looked like the rose bowl in there, There were so many flowers. - Ashley's not here yet. - Here she comes. - Oh, molly. Peter, you remember molly. She planned this shindig. - Of course I do. I apologize for my abrupt exit the last time we met. - We're all just so glad you're okay. If ashley were coming- - Ashley isn't coming? - Oh, ashley decided to take a few steps back To focus on the launch after everything that happened. - I thought you two were a team. - Oh, we are. This is both our work. - Well, then why is only one of you here? I have to say, it's concerning to hear There's division in the company leadership At a crucial time like this. - There's no division. We're stronger than ever. - I hope so. You two need each other. - Yeah, agreed. Peter, molly, I would love to introduce you To my daughter grace. - Sure. - Oh, hi. - Oh, I'd love that. I just need to check on the catering. I'll find you in a few minutes? - Shall we? - Sure, why not? (denise chuckles) - So my daughter grace is going to rutledge. - Mm-hm. - Maybe. Peter, please meet my daughter grace, And her boyfriend corey. - [both] hi. - It's a pleasure to meet you. I heard you had an meeting with my alma mater. - Peter went to rutledge. - I can call and put in a good word for you, if you'd like. - Oh. No, that's okay. - Rutledge has some of the best Technical programs in the country, But make sure you don't neglect Your liberal arts program, okay? - I- - why don't I set up a meeting For her with dr. Nicolosi? He's an old mentor of mine. He's a professor emeritus. I'm sure he'd be happy to talk with you. - I can't. Excuse me. - Grace. - Ooh. I gather I said something wrong. - I am so sorry, peter, I'll be right back. - A little advice, as a father of six, go easy on her. College admissions are hell. - Thank you. - [peter] you bet. - Have you tried the chicken skewers? - They do not agree with me. Thanks. - Grace- - mom, please. - What's going on? Talk to me. - Not here. - Yes, here. You just embarrassed me in front of my biggest investor. - I'm sorry I messed up your work party, okay? - I'm worried about you. Please talk to me. - [grace] mom, don't. - Are you nervous about rutledge? You're gonna do great there. - I didn't get into rutledge! They said I wasn't the right fit. I wasn't interesting. I didn't get in. - Why didn't you tell me? - Why do you think? I'm humiliated. You and dad got in, you've talked about sending me there Ever since I was born. - I don't care where you go to school, sweetheart. - Well, I do. (ominous music) (grace sighs) Great. (grace sighs) Of course. (door squeaks) - [molly] excuse me. (door closes) - I just wanted to take a moment To thank everyone for coming tonight. And I want to especially thank My friends and family for their support. As we take this next step forward, I want to say thank you to peter mason. This would never be possible Without your boundless encouragement and support- - And my seven million. (group laughing) - We've learned a lot of hard lessons this year. But I am so proud to say That we were able to incorporate those lessons Into a new design that is clean, simple, intuitive, And, dare I say, sexy. (group laughing) I am so excited to show you the new interface. Without further ado, please join me in the countdown. - [group] 10. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. (woman screaming) (grace gasps) - [grace] oh, my gosh. - Ashley? Ashley. Oh, my god. Oh, god. - Someone call an ambulance! - Oh, my god. Oh, god. Oh, my god. Oh, god. - I need an ambulance downtown. Hawthorne building. - Gracie, why don't you go to sleep? - Are you sure? I can stay. - There'll be a lot to do tomorrow. Get some rest. - Okay. (somber music) - I'm so sorry, daddy. Goodnight. - Oh, my god. (josh sighs) So did you know? - Know? - That she was gonna hurt herself. - No. - I mean, she didn't say anything... This thing just doesn't come out of nowhere. - Sorry, josh. She didn't say anything. - You didn't notice that she didn't show up to the party? - She wasn't gonna come to the party. (denise sighs) We had gotten in a fight, and we hadn't talked. - So you disinvited her to her own party. - No, it wasn't like that. - No? Well, it was like with me, wasn't it? - No. Can we not get into this right now? - No, no, let's not get into it now. Let's just not talk for a couple days first. - Josh, that's not fair. - Okay, why don't you tell me what's fair, denise? Was it fair when ashley was at rock bottom, Her brother was out of town, Her best friend wasn't talking to her? Is that fair? - Josh... - You know what? Congratulations on the interface, denise. You know, I hope it was worth it. (hand knocking) - Molly. - Denise, I'm so sorry. Can I come in? - It's not really a good time right now. - Your husband and your daughter... - They're in bed. - How is everyone? - How you would expect. - Denise, what happened? What did the police say? (denise sighs) - They think it was a suicide. I don't know. I don't get it. I've known ashley my entire life, And she'd never do something like this. - Sometimes, people get desperate. Ashley was so stressed lately. And you told me that the app was a complete disaster. - I mean, but to wait right before Things were gonna turn around? We killed ourselves with that new interface. I mean, all I'm saying is I don't get it. Right before things were about to take off? - Maybe it wasn't a work issue. - What do you mean? - I mean, you basically told her she was a screw-up And you didn't want to see her around anymore. - I didn't say that. - Well, that's how she took it. - What did you say to her? - Only what we agreed to. I don't think it went very well. - And you didn't think that was An important thing to mention to me? - Denise, I'm so sorry, I didn't think she'd react like that. I didn't want to ruin your party- - I don't care about the party! I just lost my best friend. And my husband lost his sister. And my daughter is having a breakdown. I don't care about anything else. - Denise, I understand and I know what it's like To feel like you're losing everything. I'm here for you. - I need to be alone right now, molly. - Of course. I'll check in with you tomorrow to see how you're doing. I'm so sorry for your loss. (birds chirping) - You're not as subtle as you think you are. - I'm sorry. - No, I'm glad you're here. Things have been so tense between my parents. I mean, I know they're upset about my aunt ashley, But I just feel like something else is going on. - Yeah, I definitely picked up on that. What do you think it is? - I don't know. I just know I have no idea What I'm supposed to say to either of them right now. - What are you working on? - Looking at the majors at state, Since I'm "not rutledge material." - I mean, who says that to an interviewee? - Apparently, anna carr does. And the weird thing is, I swear I saw her at the party last night, In the bathroom and then at the end. - Why would she be at your mom's party? What did you say her name was? Anna carr? - [grace] mm-hm. - Nah, no results. Maybe she was there with someone. - Maybe. - All right, hold on. Let me try anna carr plus rutledge. (keyboard clicking) Oh, man, she looks so nice. Baby, what is it? - [grace] that's not anna carr. - I didn't know you were in here. - Well, as nice as our guestroom is, I thought I'd spend a few minutes outside of it. - Well, I'll give you some space. - No. It's okay. I'll go. I'm just gonna check into a hotel Tomorrow after the funeral. And tell grace... Just tell her whatever you want. - Josh... - How's dad doing? (denise sighs) - I'm not sure. - Mom, what is going on? Things are super weird between you. And I know he's sleeping in the guestroom. - It's complicated, gracie. - Are you guys getting divorced? - We just need a little space. Try not to worry about it. - Mom... - Trust me on this, gracie. Is corey here? Do you guys want something to eat? - No, he just left. Mom, do you know an anna carr? - Isn't that the woman who interviewed you for rutledge? - There was a woman at your party last night. Blonde hair, black dress. I'm trying to find out who she was. - Is this about the interview? - I'm not really sure. I need to know who she is. - I wish I could help you, sweetheart, But you're describing half of the party last night. Oh. We had a photographer. I will send you the link. Maybe you'll get lucky. (cellphone clicking) There you go. - There's 3,000 photos here. - Well, we asked him to take a lot of pictures. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Goodnight, sweetheart. - Goodnight. (ominous music) - Mm. Mm. - Gotcha. (grace gasps) Oh, my god! (grace groaning) - I wasn't sure about the green and gold With the paint in here, but I think it really works. I used to decorate for the dances at school. I loved it, thinking about The first nervous dance, stolen kiss, How happy and excited everyone would be in a few hours. Well, not everyone. Mm. Not me. I didn't get invited to dances, grace. I didn't get invited anywhere. Oh, I had friends. At least, I thought I did. But, sometimes, people aren't who you thought they were. I guess you know that by now. (camera opens) (camera snaps) (camera whirs) I did everything I could To make sure everyone had a beautiful night. And they did everything they could To make sure I was miserable. It took a while, but (chuckles) I'm finally returning the favor. (camera closes) (camera thuds) The parties are a little different now. Now, I don't picture romance or laughter when I decorate. That's not the response I want anymore. - Help, mom! Help me! - Mm. Amber and jon. They wanted to renew their vows, Promise to be together forever. Now, they will. I saw your mom's news in my feed. I've been following her for a while now. I read about her relaunch, and saw my opening. Your mom needed a party. Just like amber. Just like the rest of them. Balloons. They're in the car. Don't you go anywhere. The party's about to get started. (door opens) (door closes) (grace grunts) (scissors clattering) (grace grunting) (tense music) Why would you get down there? Try to hold still. You don't want to get hurt before the big event. Think we're almost ready to get this party started. Let me just go wake up your parents. - Molly? Josh! - Denise. - [denise] josh! - What are you doing here? You can't come to a party early. (knife thuds) (denise yelps) (body thuds) no uninvited guests. (josh groans) (thrilling music) Denise, where are you? (denise whimpering) (denise yelps) (punch thuds) (josh groaning) (grace crying) (josh groaning) (vase shatters) (josh groans) (grace crying) I love party games. I used to play hide-and-seek with my best friend growing up. Then, one day, she decided She wasn't gonna let me find her anymore. She made new friends. And she forgot all about me. Her friends didn't though. They made my life a living hell. - Dammit! (cellphone clatters) - And then, one day, I found her again. And it was my turn to make her life hell. It's party time, grace. - Hey! (camera snaps) (molly groans) - Did that hurt? I'm sorry, dee dee. Yes, I know your old nickname, dee dee. Do you remember mine? - Tabby. - That's it. Of course, it wasn't the name I would've chosen. Megan gave me that, remember? I made sure she remembered before it was all over. - Tabby, how... (molly chuckles) - You didn't recognize me, did you? I'm not surprised. A hundred thousand in plastic surgery can do that. - I don't understand. - I know. You didn't understand back then, When your new friends turned into my bullies, When they pushed me out, When they made my life a living hell. And you didn't understand that what hurt The most wasn't them, denise, It was that my best friend didn't care. - I didn't realize. - No, you wouldn't have. You were too busy worried about your social climb, With amber, megan, kari. Did you ever wonder why You never heard from them about the party? - What did you do to them? - It's 'cause I got to them first, What I'm about to do to you! (scissors thudding) (molly screams) (grace grunting) (body thuds) - Dad. Go get dad. Go get dad. - [denise] stay with us. Stay with us, sweetheart. Stay with us. (josh groaning) come on, josh. - I need police and an ambulance. My dad is bleeding and a woman's been stabbed. (josh groans) 1210 chestnut street. Please hurry. (door closes) - Molly's gone. It's okay, sweetheart. The ambulance is coming right away. Okay? I don't know, officer. I've known this woman my entire life. She just stabbed my husband, attacked my daughter, And, I don't know, she's had like a grudge Against me my entire life, I guess. It's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Grace and I are right behind you. Go get my keys, please. - I don't want to leave dad. - It's okay, grace. I'm gonna be fine. That woman, I saw her at the bar. She bought me shots. - I know. I should have known. I'm so sorry. It's my fault. - Just glad that you're okay. - [molly] I see you have a date picked out for next summer. - Yes, we do. - Yeah. - I have several beautiful summer venues, Church, beach, park, And many all-inclusive packages, If you don't want to worry about catering and rentals. - That sounds perfect. - It's whatever you want. It's your party. (molly chuckles) (gentle music) (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (tense music) (dramatic music)
