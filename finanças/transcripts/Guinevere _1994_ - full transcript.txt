[OPENING THEME MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Come with me, Guinevere. GUINEVERE : They say Britain's greatest age began when Arthur pulled the sword from the stone. They got this story only part right. History is written by men. And there is much in life that they ignored. WOMAN: Quickly, Guinevere. GUINEVERE: Mama, mama! [MOURNFUL MUSIC PLAYING] [LABORED BREATHING] GUINEVERE: My mother died when I was five years old. Such things as the passing of the queen meant little then, save to her little girl. My father ruled a kingdom in the midlands. But the truth is... throughout Britain, only chaos truly reigned. And so, like all the other local kings, my father was consumed by constant wars. Unable to raise me himself, he sent me North to the sanctuary of the old religion. I found I was not alone. Many other future Kings and queens had been sent to the sanctuary for instruction. But from the very first day, I was singled out for special attention from the young priestess, Morgan L'Fei. MORGAN: Welcome, Guinevere. GUINEVERE: In this company, my childhood quickly passed. [METAL CLANKING] GUINEVERE: But among the royal born, there was a foundling. A boy L'Fei had saved from drowning. Now grown to be a fighter, and a leader... Lancelot. MAN: Guinevere. [MUSIC PLAYING] [METAL CLANKING] GUINEVERE: He was my hero. He was my friend. And from the time I was a little girl, I hoped he would become something more. GUINEVERE: Do you remember your mother? I have no mother. Except for L'Fei. She fished you out of the lake. GUINEVERE: Someone had to have thrown you in? [WATER TRICKLING] There was a time I brooded on that. That time has passed. I will never forsake you. [MUSIC PLAYING] MERLIN: I come seeking Britain's high priestess. LANCELOT: Morgan L'Fei is the high priestess. MERLIN: Tell her I bring word... of the new high king. GUINEVERE: We knew nothing of a new high king. Isolated in the north, we heard little from the rest of Britain. So when the rare traveler came, we eagerly gathered to hear the news. And though we did not know the old pilgrim's name, we were fascinated by the story that he told. All save for our priestess, Morgan L'Fei. PILGRIM: And then in a churchyard... a huge stone appeared. A stone... with a sword... embedded in it, upto its radiant hilt. And on the stone was emblazoned the words, "Who so pulleth forth this sword, "is high king. "And shall bring greatness." When all those battling monarchs, blustered along... and came and tried, [LAUGHS] [DRAMATICALLY] Huh, Ohh, Uh... [LAUGHS] But it was a boy. It was a boy of 15... who succeeded. He pulled out the sword. A boy raised in a cave, away from the world, raised by the mage... Merlin... servant to his father. For it was Arthur Pendragon, who pulled out the sword. Son of Uther. And he is now Britain's... new crowned king. Morgan: Then there is peace across this blighted island? There will be. The king, Arthur, has sworn it. And has he sworn on his foul conception? His father raped another man's wife to bring him forth. I do none speak more of Igraine and her murdered husband. Many are disinclined to argue with a miracle. Others are learning not to argue with Arthur's sword. GUINEVERE: Maybe L'Fei knew something we did not. I thought the unnamed pilgrim had come by chance, and that it was an accident when he found me alone by the water. But as we talked, I began to feel that there was a purpose to everything this stranger did. GUINEVERE: Also Healing, Geography, History, and Latin. I study Mathematics and science on my own. Why? So I may rule my kingdom wisely. A fearless king and a mighty army will do that for you. Kings and armies have not done it wisely so far. Indeed. They dominate... Breeding cruelty and resentment. True government requires equality, shared prosperity, and trust. So, you too have designs on the whole of Britain? My kingdom alone provides all the challenge I need. Mm-mmm, what kingdom is that? Camelot. [LAUGHING] Camelot! I've never heard of it. It must be quite an insignificant little dot. Insignificant? It is the only kingdom to spare in all Britain. It controls all movement North and South. The Romans wanted it and never took it. Look... We drew the line the legions never crossed. Above us, fierce tribes still keep to the old ways. Below us, the madness, the empire, and Uther. Left... trading routes shattered, holy groves laid waste, the whole fabric of community unraveled. And in its place... Chaos, and Christianity. Oh, I think if he is truly to rule all Britain, this Arthur has a lot of work to do. I'll be sure to tell him. MORGAN: What exactly is this? MORGAN: Bo... Look at it! [HORSE NEIGHING] MORGAN: Sword in a stone? The fatal phallus. Trust a man to think that up! BOY: But, isn't it a miracle, lady? MORGAN: Life is a miracle. Birth! Creation! Have you learned nothing here? But it's a wonderfully heroic story. [SARCASTICALLY] Thank you. And are more heroes what we need? MORGAN: Men who stand tall on the corpses of their victims? There was a time... When all Britain celebrated the Goddess. We celebrated the bounty of this Earth. The gifts she gave us. And women lay with her chosen ones, and embraced them closely. And we celebrated life... MORGAN: That grew within their wombs. And now, we have heroes... with bodies piled about them. Those are the fruits of the harvest they offer now. Mens victories in blood are what they celebrate. And women's blood? MORGAN: Once the sacred symbol of our fertility now make us what? Guinevere? Unclean. MORGAN: And do you think all this will change with Arthur Pendragon? Crowned in a Christian church where the only God is male? [EXHALES] MORGAN: Worship heroes? And you join those... who have abandoned this earth's beauty. MORGAN: Worship Pendragon? And you join those who have traded life for death. MORGAN: You two... Come to the sacred circle at midnight. [FIRE CRACKLING] [HORSES NEIGHING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Kneel before the power of the Goddess. MORGAN: I have waited a long while for this moment. Now it is time you knew what must be done. MORGAN: Raise your left arm. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Lancelot. You are my son... though I plucked you from the water, not from my womb. MORGAN: Among boys, you are a man. MORGAN: Among men, you will be king. No warrior in this land will defeat you. You have the strength to stop the night. [DRUMS BEATING] MORGAN: Wear this as a sign of the covenant you have made. And you, Guinevere... Wise priestess... When you become a woman, you will rule the heart of this green island. No one can control Britain who does not control your kingdom. MORGAN: You have the power to stop the night. [MUSIC PLAYING] MORGAN: Wear this... Even unto your grave. The triple spiral... The never ending cycle of birth, and life, and death. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] MORGAN: Rise. Our blood and power are joined together. Nothing can stop us now. We will defeat Arthur Pendragon, and rule Britain. Are we going to make war? We are already at war! Don't you understand that? Where are the women in Pendragon's world? Where is this Merlin's mother, or his wife? Where is Arthur's mother or wife? You said Igraine was Arthur's mother. Igraine was my mother first! But Uther raped her. MORGAN: He murdered my father and he raped her. Then he married her with the bishop's blessing. And he ordered me, a nine year old child, to be hanged. GUINEVERE: But you live still. I was hid here on condition I never speak my true name, and I have not. MORGAN: For too many years I have remained silent while the forces of darkness have run rampant in this land. But when the Goddess sent you both to me to be my children... I began to see how I might have my voice again. MORGAN: King and Queen you shall be. First of Camelot, then of all Britain. All is ready. Our people nearly awake their leaders. You will offer your next blood to the Goddess. And the first full moon after... you shall lie with her. MORGAN: And thus... you shall both be wed. Without my father's blessing? Long ago, he abandoned you to me. MORGAN: And tonight I have given you to the Goddess, and to each other. MORGAN: Your vows are written in blood. But it is my father's kingdom, and what if he will not accept this? Then he will die. And if you deny your vow, Guinevere... you will burn. MORGAN: Just as your offering did. [BASS DRUM SOUNDING] GUINEVERE: I'd sworn to wed Lancelot when next I bled. But I could not bring myself to it without my father's consent. GUINEVERE: And so... When my menses began I tried to hide it from the world. How long? How many days has it been, Guinevere? It doesn't matter. MORGAN: We can begin now. BOY: Lady... Riders have come from Camelot seeking Guinevere. MORGAN: If your father is dead... Then that solves everything. [HORSE GALLOPING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [HORSE GALLOPING] [BOYS CHATTING IN BACKGROUND] GUINEVERE: Is my father... MORGAN: Your father is well. And sends his thanks to the Goddess. He simply wanted you home. Then you must send me. I said I would. And I will send your husband beside you. MORGAN: And all the warriors of the triple spiral as well. Now you must fast and prepare yourself for the bride's blessing. I will come for you when the moon is high. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] GUINEVERE: I'll take you to the stable. GUINEVERE: Come on. [METAL CLANKING] [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [HORSES GALLOPING] [HOSES NEIGHING] [PANTING] LANCELOT: You would leave without saying goodbye to me? [WHISPERING] I'm so sorry. [EXHALES] [WHISPERING] I'm so sorry. GUINEVERE: How could I get her to this thing she wants? You cannot marry me? I cannot do it without my father's knowledge. I cannot make war on the high king, Arthur, without knowing for what he stands. Did you know she was half sister to this Arthur? No. GUINEVERE: Did you know what she had planned? LANCELOT: NO. Then come with me. GUINEVERE: I'll tell my father how much I love you. If I can't have you, I'll never wed. I'm of unknown birth. He won't think me worthy. Then I'll renounce my crown. And we can wander together free. No. Please, you cannot abandon your obligation to your people. And I cannot abandon mine. Neither to the goddess or to L'Fei. You agree with her? You can't imagine what it's like to be drowning. And then when someone gives you your life back... You remember it. Then this is it? I'll never again see you? [EXHALES] [CREAKING] [HORSE NEIGHING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] MORGAN: I order you to stay. If you defy me, the Goddess will despise you! MORGAN: You'll be cursed. And the dark ones will possess your life. No! I think not, Morgan! Stop her! [HORSE GALLOPING] [BIRD WHISTLING] GUINEVERE: This place is darker and sadder than I remember. MAN: There is no joy in preparing for war. [DOOR OPENS] GUINEVERE: Father? Guinevere! Guinevere! LEODOGAN: It has been so long. So long. And I must send you away again. MAN: Not necessary. MAN: I like this place. MAN: I'm ready to stay here. LEODOGAN: Malgin, King of Gal, has come to seek your hand. I seek this kingdom! I will have it through marriage, or through war. MALGIN: Marriage, of course, will be... MALGIN: Much more pleasant. I'll leave you to plan our wedding. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] GUINEVERE: Father, I come to you out of obedience, but I do not want to marry that man. I should hope not. He's a cruel and ambitious beast. But the weeks have delayed... Summoning you, awaiting your arrival has given us time to call on men, and to manufacture arms. Then this was all a game? No. Oh no, Guinevere. There's no game. Many thousand of lives will be saved if you marry Malgin. LEODOGAN: What they'd be worth under him... I cannot say. Freedom is not easily claimed. I had to leave in a hurry, father, you'll have to lend me a sword. Spoken like a true queen of Camelot. But I cannot let you on the field. I can wield a sword as well as anyone... I don't doubt it. But you are the prize. Malgin must not seize you. Forward! [MEN SCREAMING] Camelot, and Guinevere! [MEN SCREAMING] [METAL CLANKING] [GROANING] [METAL CLANKING] [GROANING] [MAN GROANING] [COUGHING] [FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] [DOOR OPENS] GUINEVERE: I will marry him. Let there be no more dying. LEODOGAN: I will send a message. MAN: My Lord, visitors to see you. We fight under no banner. But we've heard of your struggles with this ruffian, and we've come to offer you aid. I thank you. But I'm on the verge of surrendering. Let us fight alone then. Even we six can do some damage. No, I cannot allow that. But I will stand with you, together with what remains of my army. [HORSES NEIGHING] MALGIN: Alone! MALGIN: Battle line! Battle line! MAN: Line for battle! Form a line! [MEN SCREAMING] [METAL CLANKING] [MEN SCREAMING] [METAL CLANKING] [SCREAMING] [MOANING] The king is dead. Long live the Queen. My father and I discussed how we might repay you. GUINEVERE: Anything I have is yours. Anything. GUINEVERE: Even the great castle at Aiden. On point of fact, we're not much interested in real estate. MERLIN: What he needs is a wife. [HORSES NEIGHING] Will you have me, my lady... as your husband? [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] How can I deny you? I owe you more than my life. MERLIN: How can you value anything more than your own life, my lady? The life of my kingdom, GUINEVERE: the men who would have been slaughtered, the women who would have been taken had the enemy not been stopped. MERLIN: And so... not knowing his name, or birth, you will give to this young boy your maiden hand? Nobility of heart is more important than nobility of birth. If you are not entitled to be King, then you shall rule here as my consort. And we shall be as equals, you and I. GAWAIN: I'm afraid not, my lady. Not quite as equals. For you are Queen of Camelot, but this man... who'll be rolling you between the sheets soon enough, is Arthur Pendragon, high king of Britain. I wanted to win you on merit, my lady. That you did, my Lord. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CREAKING] [FLUTE MUSIC PLAYING] They call me Merlin. GUINEVERE: So even you just wanted my kingdom? If we had wanted that, we would have taken it by force. MERLIN: Guinevere... White shadow. You have been chosen by me. Chosen above all others to be Arthur's queen. MERLIN: And though men desire you... for your lands, and for your... for your great beauty... I have chosen you... For your mind. MERLIN: I raised Arthur. I know his magnificence. And I have made him High king of Britain. And I know his flaws. And that the great challenges are yet to come. It's one thing to conquer a country... It's another to transform it. MERLIN: But Britain must be raised from its bloody darkness... into a land of peace, and law. Arthur can't do it. Not alone. And I... I am an old man. I had to find him someone with the strength and wisdom, to keep the promise. MERLIN: And so... I found him you. It will not be an easy job. But it is the one you were born to do. MERLIN: So... Are you ready now... to wed Arthur Pendragon? [SOFTLY] Yes. Are you a woman? I have taken on the power of those who bleed but do not die. MERLIN: And are you pure? [SNIFFLES] I have fasted... and bathed myself in sacred ways. Then... The moon is full. The Goddess awaits. [WATER FLOWING] GUINEVERE: Mother, this is your daughter, Guinevere... [BIRDS CHIRPING] I know you still love me, despite Morgan's hate. Tonight, I will be a child no longer. As you turned from new, to full, to dark. As all existence turns, from birth, to life, to death. I too turn... from maiden to woman. To be reborn again in your image. The source... of life. Aah! [GROANING] Aah! [GROANING] [METAL CLANKING] [GROANING] ARTHUR: Guinevere! ARTHUR: Guinevere! Who taught you to fight like that? At the sanctuary... I had a good instructor. I'll say. Malgin must've sent these two cowards. I'll have them dumped back over his border. ARTHUR: I haven't seen a hilt like this before. It balances the blade much better than ours. ARTHUR: I'll talk to Kei, see if he can come up... GUINEVERE: Morgan L'Fei! Oh, God. [EXHALES] ARTHUR: You were right. We shall rule as equals, you and I. [DOOR CREAKING] [DOOR CREAKING] GUINEVERE: This room has been unused since I was five. And now, finally, my mother sleeps with my father once again. [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING] I need not take you for the first time while you are in mourning. But in the eyes of your religion, we are not wed until it is done. All I know about this is what I read in Ovid. Well, it's easier lying down for one thing. I will try to be gentle... and quick. [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] The king awaits... his honor guard! You worship the white Christ, Merlin? Underneath the ritual... it's all the same God. Goddess! [MERLIN LAUGHING] I want to explain to you about this coronation. You may be pagan... and worth pagan wealth. But most of your kingdom... is Christian. The bishops will run this coronation. It's called, uh, being queen, to all the lands. But if I do not honor this God... I make my vows to? You honor the hope of peace. To which they are made. Your right to the crown... perhaps, even to your life... depends on this. BISHOP: Merlin. Merlin, we will speak with you. My Lords. MERLIN: Guinevere. Arthur's bride. BISHOP: Not in our eyes. MERLIN: Perhaps you will be able to rectify that at the coronation. The knife. Remove it. Arthur wears his sword. He has said that we will rule as equals. An anointed queen does not shed blood. Let them have the knife, Guinevere. [FOOTSTEPS] And now I'm supposed to spread my hands and let myself be killed? MERLIN: You'll not go unprotected here. MERLIN: You'll have your own champion. A brave warrior, sworn to protect you. MERLIN: Just as Gawain is sworn to Arthur. GUINEVERE: And where do I find him? MERLIN: Normally, we'd choose him from among the best in the kingdom, but today... your champion arrived, as a gift. GUINEVERE: And I must accept him? MERLIN: Yes. MERLIN: Yes! GUINEVERE: Then it was just the kingdom you wanted! MERLIN: You're forgetting everything I told you! But if you are to rule Britain you must forget yourself. No more fear. No more desire. No more anything. There isn't time. You have a great deal to learn. MERLIN: Listen... Your king and your courtier will be entirely Christian. But the pagans are powerful. They must be given their due. To refuse an offering from the high priestess... would be taken badly. The high priestess? Morgan sent this champion? I wasn't sure you knew about L'Fei. I know she hates Arthur. I know she tried to have me murdered. We were aware of that. But we still need the illusion of her loyalty. And I am to entrust my life to an illusion? MERLIN: It's called politics. MERLIN: But the warrior is brave enough. MERLIN: I believe you know him. GAWAIN: Merlin, you're wanted for the procession. GAWAIN: He'll be back with you presently. [HORSES NEIGHING] Oh, she sent you too... To kill me? Kill you? It is for the loss of you that I've wanted to die. I am so alone, Lac. When you ruled away from me, I could feel my soul wrenched out of me. This past year I prayed so often you would come. Oh! LANCELOT: I've spent this past year mad. Roaming the darkest roads. Challenging all those who crossed my path. I wanted them to kill me. And Morgan knew it. Knew that unless she changed, she could not stop me. And finally she has let me go. Let you go? To be with you. As I need to. And I am married to Arthur now. LANCELOT: No! Not in his world, I heard them. In our world, the Goddess knows that you were pledged to me first. Or have you come to love this Arthur? You are the only one that I love. Then come with me now. Before they set their crosses on you. WOMAN: My lady. They wait on your attendance. [FOOTSTEPS] It's too late, Lac. Then I will kill Arthur! It is not Arthur who binds me or sets me free. As a wheel turns in water, I too am being turned by something. I believe there is a possibility of peace with this high king. Out of all this pain... something new will be born. GUINEVERE: I have a chance to make it something good, Lac. A world of justice. Not ruled by violence, nor Morgan's rage and envy. You think that fair to her? To destroy Arthur she has tried to stop me twice. Once by a murderer's hand... And now with you. [HORSE NEIGHING] [WHISPERING] Kiss me. [WHISPERING] For the last time. And then there's nothing more between us. GUINEVERE: Promise? I won't. Then you must go and never come back again. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] [LANCELOT WHISPERING] Don't. [GUINEVERE SOBBING] [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] [FIRE CRACKLING] MAN: Arch! MAN: Swords! [METAL CLANKING] You picked a winner, Merlin. She's a better queen than you know, my boy. [MUSIC PLAYING] [RUMBLING] Sending Lancelot on ahead. We're going to try to outfox these Northern pagans. Go with the goddess. MAN: I'll get some more wood. [MEN CHATTING] ARTHUR: Guin. I hoped the fighting would be over long ago. There's still too many local kings who make war on their neighbors. Maybe you should be heading home. All the other women have. I won't go home before you. And when the prince is born, will you not say I'm in a midst of playing of battle? The "princess" I hope will be weaned on peace. [BIRD WHISTLING] I do not like these woods. SOLDIER: Rider approaching! [HORSE GALLOPING] Rise and identify yourself, sir. I have been sent from the castle seven miles yonder, to bid the high King, and his party take shelter from this night. ARTHUR: Are there more horses like these? I could use more for such sturdy footing. Forty brood mares at least, sire. And half a dozen stallion. ARTHUR: Bring the horses. ARTHUR: Mm-mmm. ARTHUR: It's too bad Merlin's gone back to his lair. He may say he's too old for all our rampaging about, but he's not too old for a feast such as this. Our cook thought you might prefer a warming drink, my lady. ARTHUR: Go on, Guin, it's just a bit. ARTHUR: Mm-mmm. WOMAN: Your bed is ready, sire. [LAUGHTER] ARTHUR: Yes. GUINEVERE: Stay with me, Arthur. ARTHUR: No. I'm too restless to lie in bed yet. And there are things I need to discuss with Gawain. It would be better for you to get some sleep. [FOOTSTEPS] [EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS] [CREAKING] WOMAN: Our mistress awaits your pleasure. [CREAKING] [GROANING] GUINEVERE: Arthur? [GROANING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Arthur! Arthur. [BREATHING HEAVILY] GUINEVERE: Arthur? [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] Arthur. GUINEVERE: Arthur! [GROANING] [THUDS] Leave us. This is woman's work. GUINEVERE: Oh, God! [GROANING] [GROANING] GUINEVERE: Arthur. [GROANING] [GROANING] It's ergot. MORGAN: Do you recognize its action? Only ten times more than we would usually give. GUINEVERE: Why? Why did you poison me? Arthur's seed is now within me. Child of the queen's daughter by the old laws. Child of the King's son by the new. But this one cannot be denied. It will still be second to mine! Do you really think so? Your babe is dying. MORGAN: And you are dying too. [GUINEVERE SCREAMING] Whore! Don't torment yourself. MORGAN: It will all be over soon. [SCREAMING] [MOANING AND SOBBING] [SOBBING] [FOOTSTEPS] [HORSE NEIGHING] [MOANING] [COUGHING] [MOANING] WOMAN: It's over now, dear. You have a sweet young girl. [BABY BABBLING] [BABY BABBLING] Well, no, you're not finished yet. I have to get out of here. But you must rest. You'll bleed to death. No, I can't let Morgan find her. [BABY BABBLING] [SOBBING] When I'm gone... you must leave this place forever. You must... You must tell no one that you saw me. [SOBBING] Raise my daughter as your own. Mother, guard my baby. [HORSE GALLOPING] GUINEVERE: Lac. [WHISPERING] Where's my baby? Is she safe? Everyone searched. They found nothing. They say that it came too early. They all think your baby's dead, Guin. She'll be safe from L'Fei. I promise. Now sleep. GUINEVERE: Lac. ARTHUR: It's Arthur, your king. Lancelot is gone. We're clearing some Irish invaders from Dundrennan. You sent him away? I thought he was to protect me. I was tired of his silent accusations! I was tired of always hearing you call his name! I was here too! Not as often, maybe, but I have a country to rule. And without you it hasn't been easy. [EXHALES] ARTHUR: Come on, Guin. Can we forget what happened? It was a night's foolishness and nothing more. You are my queen. That woman... I can't even remember what she looked like. Then you should make an effort, Arthur. That woman you lay with was L'Fei. GUINEVERE: Also known as Morgan. Igraine's daughter, your sister! I will have her killed. And we will never speak of this again. GUINEVERE: You cannot kill the High Priestess of Britain, without bringing down upon you all the pagan kingdoms, and plunging Britain once more into civil war. But she has stained my crown with incest. She's defiled my kingship. I can't bear that she's out there unpunished after having done that to me! To you? And have I emerged unscathed? ARTHUR: They say that you'll never bear me an heir. We will never have our own... loving family. [SARCASTICALLY] Uh, not that I would know what it looks like. Haven't you heard the stories? ARTHUR: That my father raped my mother? [SCOFFS] Merlin says that it isn't true. But he took me the day I was born. There had to be a reason. You never asked your father? I never saw him. I never saw either one of them. ARTHUR: This island will be my children. And that is how we will overcome what has happened. By not allowing it to destroy our dreams. Your dreams. I'm just here clearing out all the clutter. You do more than that, Arthur. No. I know my limits, give me credit for that. What I am is a great warrior. And it is time I took my people back to battle. Malgin was using my absence to unite the last kings in rebellion. And I will crush him, end them all... for good. It will be a magnificent fight. We've got these new things called crossbows, that allows us to fire with one hand while we ride. Oh, Guin, you should see them, well, you will see them. No. ARTHUR: But... They told me you were better. Just tired. And fresh air would do you good, Guin. This could be our very last battle. Arthur, someone will always be wanting to test his sword against yours. There will always be violence until we say "enough." Malgin killed your father. ARTHUR: You think enough will stop him? I've had a lot of time to think about that. Traveling with you for a year... Lost in nightmares these past few months. It is upto us to create a different way. A different way of solving differences. A different way of wielding power. We have to be better. Not just in battle. And make others want to be like us. To win not just our protection, but our esteem. Well, I can tell you they'll esteem us when they see these crossbows. We seem like an army twice as fierce as our numbers. GUINEVERE: Arthur, I will not be riding with you again to battle. It is time I begin what Merlin shows me to do. Well, it's easy to say that with him hidden away in his lair, now, isn't it? Nothing is easy anymore. [DOOR CREAKING] GAWAIN: Ahem. My Lord. Troops are ready. [DOOR CLOSES] Then I leave the kingdom in your capable hands, Guinevere. I accept the burden gladly. [FOOTSTEPS] Arthur. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Return safely. That is my intention. [DOOR CREAKS] MAN: My lady, an envoy. He demands to see the queen. Has he come from Dundrennan? Has he word of Lancelot's army? He has come from Gal. He says he has news of the king. Who's at the end of the long board always feel less honored. Arthur wants every one of his guests close at hand. Big and square. It'd be hard to pass the haggies, ma'am. Then make it hollow, with places for servers to enter. [EXHALES] And make it round. It's been six months since I last saw my husband. What news do you bring me, sir? That you will never again see him. He has been captured and is prisoner of Malgin of Gal. And will die. He and all his army. Britain will not allow Arthur to be slain. I think it will. For Malgin is high king now. By who's authority? One could ask by who's authority Arthur held it? When in lying with his sister he committed incest. An act which you... has said to have witnessed... my Queen. Is this Morgan's doing? ENVOY: Only half. As they say... The beast has two backs. It has none! This accusation is a damnable lie. Is it? The world will see no army comes to dispute it. Trial by combat has been replaced by law. Not in the rebel kingdoms. You have till the full moon to bring your warriors. Malgin holds most of them. And the rest... with Lancelot... have not been heard from for many months. ENVOY: Shall I tell my lord you concede to the charge? Tell your Lord I concede nothing. GUINEVERE: Tell him he will have to defend his lies. Against who? Against Guinevere, High Queen of Britain. And remind him that Britain has a tradition of warrior queens. GUINEVERE: Tell him to think on Boudica, queen of Iceni, who destroyed Rome's entire ninth legion. Tell him to think on Katemanda, queen of the Buganti's, from whom I am descended. GUINEVERE: Tell him though I have sworn on my crown, never to raise a weapon, if he harms one hair on Arthur's anointed head... tell Malgin I will kill him myself. [FOOTSTEPS] It's deadly sharp. And I made it lighter befitting your size, my lady. I will not touch it till I need to. Then, if you would permit... I will come along as your squire. MAN: We will not let you ride alone. GUINEVERE: You are welcome, my friends. MERLIN: Arthur... is a great warrior. A charismatic leader. But only an ordinary man. And you thought he was sent by the heavens. Uh, I think... considering he was Uther's son... I did a pretty good job. So the truth means nothing? MERLIN: It means a great deal. But nothing in this world is either black, or white. MERLIN: It's not a bad thing... Guinevere... to inspire the world to true nobility. One man or one woman... makes it possible for the rest of us... to rise above what we thought we could do. One hero makes us all heroes. One visionary... can show us all the way to peace. And that is why I am riding armed into battle? MERLIN: I told you, you were being tested. But I know you will find a way to triumph. Just as you found a way to save your child. You've seen my baby? She... She is well. And well hidden on the isle of Anglesey. I told you I was practiced at spiriting a vase more wet than Draconus. MERLIN: I must tell you something... Something I told Arthur's mother. This child... belongs to Britain. Claim her... and she will be destroyed. MERLIN: One day... she will return like her father to save her country. But now... Guinevere... It is your turn to save your country. Will you come with me? I have never left you. And I never will, my child. MERLIN: Go with God. And with the Goddess. One day... we will meet again. [BIRDS CHIRPING] MAN: We've come to fight for Arthur. Onward to the North then. [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] MEN: This way... Join us. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] SQUIRE: That's the castle, my lady. Fortified till the hilt. No way in, and no way out. Not only that, but... four kings have joined with Malgin. GUINEVERE: Our men will be slaughtered. All will be slaughtered. MAN: I'm going off to fetch more wood... [HORSE GALLOPING] [LAUGHTER] [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] [GROANING] GUINEVERE: Tell your lord that Guinevere, High Queen of Britain, would see him here and now alone. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] SOLDIER: Open the gate. [MEN CHATTING] [FOOTSTEPS] How did you get here? GUINEVERE: Morgan is not the only one who knows magic. I was tutored by Merlin as well as by she. Even Morgan isn't leaving Arthur's death to magic. Strip her and search her. You would let other men touch your future wife? Stop! I have come to make you a deal. What kind of a deal could you make with me? Four kings have come to make sure Arthur dies. I can offer you something far better than Arthur's blood. GUINEVERE: One unfairly when he and his army are all in chains. What kind of truth? What kind of honor will such a victory accord you? Release Arthur. GUINEVERE: And I will come to you myself. Freely. With all my lands and all my subjects. GUINEVERE: You will have no more and no less than Arthur did when he wed me. And if you then unite all of Britain... you must be acknowledged greater than he. I will have you anyway. No, I will kill myself if he dies. And you will have bloody chaos on your hands, and Saxons on your shores quick to smell the advantage. You will come to me. You will... surrender yourself, you'll... spread your legs for me? And you expect me to believe... that you won't change your mind again? You have my word. I will swear whatever vow you wish. You will swear also never... to seek escape... or accept rescue. I will swear that also. You will swear... in the morn... before the Goddess and her armies. I will come to you in the morn. In all my finery. In the morn then... or when the sun reaches mid-sky, your king, and your country... will die. [THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING] GUINEVERE: Make sure my horse is fed. SQUIRE: Yes, my lady. [DOOR OPENS] [RUMBLING] [FIRE CRACKLING] GUINEVERE: Lac? LANCELOT: Yes, it is I. [BREATHING EXCITEDLY] GUINEVERE: Have you really come to help me? To save Arthur? I don't think I would, if it's all I could to extricate us from the siege. He sends us against a force a hundred times our own. But you... You and your army, you can still rescue him. Guin, my army... what's left of my army is still three days behind. I could not make them ride any longer without sleep. But you came! You would think of something. If not I must exchange myself for him in the morn. That I will not let you do. And I cannot let Arthur die. As he let you lie dying while he bed Morgan? He was enchanted, you know her powers. Then why they never worked on us? Perhaps she plays with us in a different way. Or perhaps Arthur chose to be enchanted! It would not have been the first time, nor the last. [THUNDER RUMBLING] He's not perfect, Lac. He is perhaps further from it than you. But he has allowed his people to believe they are a nation, and they need him if they are to endure. No, Guin. You are what they need now. Not another warrior with a blood dripping sword. It is your wisdom that will carry them. Your dreams that will inspire them. It is you they followed here! I will take responsibility, and I will carry you away, and not until Arthur is dead will I set you free. [RUMBLING] And then you may have me executed. LANCELOT: As you may need to. LANCELOT: But the people will understand my passion, and you will remain as their high queen. And I will be asking of Arthur no more than I ask of myself. And I will never have had the pleasure... of anyone's sheets. [FIRE CRACKLING] Tonight then. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [KISSING PASSIONATELY] [BREATHING HEAVILY] LANCELOT: No! GUINEVERE: I know. Because your plan wont work, Lac. It won't work. If I refuse Malgin, he'll send five kingdoms against me. And without you or Arthur to protect them my people will be drowned in their own blood. MORGAN: You can leave Malgin to me. [SOFTLY] You! You did all this? He used me for his purposes. And I will use him for mine. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [GUINEVERE SCREAMING] LANCELOT: No, Guin! Now none of us is perfect. [WHISPERING] What? GUINEVERE: What do you want from me? Nothing other than what you want for yourself. MORGAN: Lancelot beside you on the high throne of Britain. I know you hate me. I know you have reason. Sometimes our paths are crueler than we would wish them to be. MORGAN: But I can give you both a piece of the love you have dreamed of. Think back, Guinevere, of your days at the sanctuary. And realize that your vision is not so different from mine. Where do you think you got it from, child? [RUMBLING] Let Lancelot take you from here. I will deal with what comes after. LANCELOT: It's almost dawn, Guin. We should be going. You serve me... Not L'Fei. Her darkness offers her heart's desire. It is the darkness still. And I say I will defeat her. Arthur will not die. GUINEVERE: You will fight one last battle for me. And then you will be discharged of all your vows and obligations. Perhaps if I'm lucky I will not survive this battle. But if I live... I will accept your release, and depart this country. Know that when you leave, you take my heart with you. I await your orders, my queen. Rise, Lancelot. And hear what you must do. [HORSES NEIGHING] [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] Don't do this. GUINEVERE: L'Fei has promised to betray you. And Lancelot has come with all his army. Look up, Malgin, and face your destroyer. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] By this army... you know that Arthur Pendragon is high king. By this Arthur, you know that Camelot will live. And that the time of swords raised... Britain against Britain is over! We are one people. One nation! We are sharers of one dream. Or so you can choose to be. You can choose to put your might to the work of greatness. GUINEVERE: Or you can die. And miss the splendor that will come. Urian! URIAN: We came to witness a trial. Not to be slaughtered. Stater. You encouraged my campaign against Pendragon. I was wrong. She is right. GUINEVERE: I think you had better you release Arthur, my Lord. [MORGAN SCREAMING] Kill him now, Malgin, as you promised! [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING] Release him. Come on, Arthur. We're going home. [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] GUINEVERE: Enter. GUINEVERE: Kaethi, could you please excuse us for a moment. [DOOR CLOSES] He has left, hasn't he? Yes, my lady, he has. Did he... give you any message for me? No, my lady, he said nothing. But he... just sent you this. [GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CLAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: The King and Queen! I would have thought Merlin would have come to see this. He is gone, Arthur. Both of them are gone. We're alone then? It's just we two together. It will be enough. ALL: All hail, Arthur! ALL: High King of Britain! ALL: All hail, Guinevere! ALL: His most high Queen! [LAUGHTER] GUINEVERE: And so, Lancelot left, Merlin died, but Arthur and I endured. Peace came to Britain. And with it, prosperity. And Camelot, became a beacon to all people in all lands for all time. [MUSIC ENDS]
