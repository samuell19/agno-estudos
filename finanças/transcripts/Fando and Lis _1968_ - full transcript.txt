Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, there was a mystical city... ...Tar. And at that time, all the cities were intact and flourishing. Because the final war had not yet begun. When the great catastrophe occurred, all the cities crumbled... ...except Tar. Tar still exists. If you know where to look for it, you will find it. And when you get there you will be presented with wine and water, and play with a gramophone. When you get there, you will help harvest grapes and you will pick up scorpions hidden under white rocks. When you get there, you will know eternity. You'll see a bird that drinks one drop of water from the ocean every hundred years. When you get there, you'll understand life. You'll become a cat, phoenix, swan, elephant, baby and an old man. You'll be alone and accompanied. You'll love and be loved, you'll be everywhere, and yours will be the seal of seals. As you approach the future, you'll find ecstasy, and it will never abandon you. THE TREE SOUGHT REFUGE IN THE LEAF Let's play. OK, I'm a famous pianist. If you're a famous pianist and I cut off your arm, then what will you do? I'll become a famous painter. And if I cut off the other one, what will you do? I'll become a famous dancer. And if I cut off your legs, then what? Then I'll become a famous singer. And if I slit your throat, then what? Once dead, my skin will become a beautiful drum. What if I burn the drum? I will become a cloud and take on any shape. And if the cloud dissolves, what then? I will become rain and make the grass grow. You win. I'm going to miss you when you're gone. If you ever feel too lonely, search for the magical city of Tar. To Tar, to Tar. So close and yet so far To Tar, to Tar. So close and yet so far What a misfortune to be paralyzed. It doesn't matter if you're paralyzed. I'll take you everywhere. How kind, Fando. Fando, remember your letters when you were in hospital? I felt so special when I received such long letters. And when you had nothing else to say, you sent me toilet roll so that the letter looked large. How happy I was! The tree sought refuge in the leaf, the house in the door, and the city in the house. The same scene over and over. The tree became a leaf, the house a door, and the city a house. It was hard to see all that and not seek refuge in my hands. Leave him alone! Let me show you my world. Come, follow him. Enter. - Sign here! It's a contract. - Here. We'll run strings through your hands and feet Here. All this money, it's yours. Let me do that. Let me go! I can't remember anything. I don't know what's wrong. Please stay here with me. What matters is where the wind comes from. No, what matters is where wind goes to. What matters is where it comes from. No, what matters is where wind goes to. What matters is where it comes from. What matters is sleeping. Look. What a cute little girl. Nice legs! No! No! Lay down with us. Get away from me! Let go! Look at her. She can't move. Fando. Hey! Fando! Thanks for entertaining us. When you're in the city of Tar, you'll know love. And you'll ride with a falcon on your shoulder. When you're there, you'll never see snow on the streets. And you won't die alone. I will die And no one will remember me I will die And no one will remember me Yes, Lis. I'll remember you. I'll visit your grave with a flower and a dog. And at your funeral, I'll sing in a low voice, "How beautiful is a funeral". How beautiful is a funeral How beautiful is a funeral I'll visit your grave With a flower and a dog With a flower and a dog Do you really love me, Fando? Yes, Lis. I don't want you to die. I'll feel very sad when you die. END OF THE FIRST CHANT AND TAR WAS INSIDE HIS HEAD Is this the right way? Let's see. To advance a mile, we only have to take a step. If Tar doesn't exist, we'll have to invent it. You're right. Lis, I want to do a world of things for you. - How many? - As many as I can. Then you have to fight for life. But, Lis... I don't know why I should. And if I knew, I don't think I'd have the strength. And if I had it, I don't know what good it would do anyway. Try harder, Fando. Everything seems so difficult, but you always have an answer. No, not always. Sometimes I pretend to have one. But this isn't a game, Lis. Yes, Fando. I know it's no game. There's no way out. I think that's enough for now. Hey! Come this way! There are thorns. You want to know who that is? She's a beautiful child. Is this the way to Tar? If you think it is, then it is. This is the way to Tar! Look around. There and there. You'll see there is no day or night. When you hear an intense heartbeat, it will be night. Now those who sleep will get up and walk. - Here, try some. - It stinks! - I'll put you in. - No, I can't. I know you can't walk, but you can stand up. Don't leave me here, Fando. - Goodbye! - Come back, Fando. Look how nice I am. I am coming to get you. Did you see that? I'll buy you a boat when we get to Tar and take it on the river. - Can you imagine, Lis? - Yes, Fando. And I'll try to cure your sickness. I don't want to see you suffer. I want to have many children. You're the best, Fando. Do you want to hear a beautiful fable? Like the one about a man and a paralyzed woman on a little cart, and their journey to Tar. - Help me down, please. - Yes, Lis. Look how beautiful it is here! Do you like it? Yes! I love it! How happy I am! Look at the rocks! Yes, Fando. They're beautiful. They're the most beautiful stones I've ever seen. - Look at the flowers, Lis. - I don't see any, Fando. It doesn't matter. Look at them! But there aren't any. Don't cry. I told you to look at the damn flowers! Yes, Fando. I'm sorry. What a cry-baby! It's beautiful here with all the flowers and trees. Where do you see trees? Right there on the path by the flowers. You're too heavy. There are flowers but no trees! Yes, there are flowers but no trees. You're starting to be a pain in the ass. You're hurting me. I'm sorry, Fando. - I wish I could walk. - You want to walk? There! You still haven't seen the flowers! Have you? Have you? Yes, thank you, Fando. Don't cry. They're pretty, right? - Don't cry. - I'm not crying. I'm sorry. Put me in the cart. Come on, please. I do so much for you, and all you do is cry! I'm sorry, Fando. One of these days I'll leave. No, Fando. Please don't leave me. I have no one but you. I'm leaving! I'll never see you again. Faggot! No. Father. Father. END OF THE SECOND CHANT THE SOLITARY MAN WAS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED You're so smart, Lis. But what good is that if you keep making me suffer? No, Lis. I don't make you suffer. On the contrary. You're always telling me that. But then you say you'll chain me down so I can't move. You make me cry. Yes, Lis, you're right. But I swear I won't do it anymore. You say you'll cure me when we get to Tar, to prove that you don't want to hurt me. I know. Kiss me, Lis. This time I promise it's true. I believe you. A little blood for the love of God. A bit of blood for the love of God. Have mercy on this poor blind man. How nice of you. Here, hold your arm out. What about me? Here you go, my son. Lick it clean! Have pity on the poor blind man. A bit of blood for the love of God. Kiss your mother. Come on. She's about to die. Here, my son. Eat! Eat! You need to eat! Eat! Eat up, my child. Your mother will feed you well. Kiss your mother for the last time. Do it. I'm dying. I don't have much time. My protégés are waiting... ...to see me die. I belong to my fans. My fans, I perish for you. Bravo! Bravo! She's the best. Thank you for coming. Thank you. She's the best at dying. What a performance. Come and feel my body getting cold. I've got a piece! This is my final gift. Watch. When I wanted to, you couldn't. When I didn't want to, you could. Father! Father! Kill me, my son. Goodbye. Thank you for killing me. Mama. Careful. Watch your step. Thank you. Fando. END OF THE THIRD CHANT AND WHEN I WANTED TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM HER, I REALIZED WE FORMED ONE BODY WITH TWO HEADS. The feather was on the bed The bed was on the feather The feather, the feather... The feather was on the bed Don't do that! No, Fando, no! - Look. - She's pretty, very pretty. - It's true. - She's very pretty. Stupendous! Come closer to see her. - Look how soft her skin is. - Yes, it's very soft. It's truly magnificent. - Unique. - Touch her all over. Don't be shy. The best of all is when you kiss her. Kiss her! Caress her using both hands. The legs as well. Look at her beautiful toes. And now, is she worthwhile? - Very much so. - Of course. She's... my fiancée. Hey! Don't leave like that! Come back! It's your fault. Don't cry. I said don't cry! You're the most useless girl in the world! Get Dressed! To Tar, to Tar Off we go to Tar Take me off the cart. Fando, I don't feel well. You don't want to die now, do you? I feel bad. It seems like we're still in the same place. We haven't gone anywhere. Once, my mother tied me to a chair. A priest made a hole in my head and took out the stone of madness. Sick, ill. To chew, to command. - To love, to masturbate. . . - Mama. You always lie to me. Are you going to handcuff me now, even though I'm chained to the cart already? No, I won't. Kiss me, Lis. You think you can fool me with a kiss? Whose mouth am I going to kiss? - Look at my drum. - How beautiful. - Round and beautiful. - Yes, round and beautiful. I only need it to sing you songs. Sing the "feather song". The feather was on the bed, the bed was on the feather The feather, the feather, the feather was on the bed I love it. Once we're in Tar, sing it to me all the time. What do you have in your bag? Show me. I knew it. You want to put me in handcuffs! You keep lying to me. I knew it! I knew it! I just want to play. You've been playing all along. No. - Then get rid of them. - No. No, don't cry. I love you. Don't leave me, Fando. I don't have anyone else. Don't hurt me. - Oh, no, I won't leave you. - Hold me tight. Hold me tight. How cruel I am to you. Give me your hands. I said your hands! I command you! Damn, they're broken. It's your fault! You always put pebbles in the lock. Give me the other hand. They're broken. It's your fault. Now you're going to crawl! Crawl! Crawl! - Crawl! - I can't go on. - Crawl! - I can't. I can't! My drum! My drum! You broke my drum! You broke... my drum! No, Fando. Don't hit me. Don't kick me. Don't kill me. Fando, don't kick me! Fando, don't hit me! Please, don't! When you arrive at Tar, you'll wear a golden crown upon your head. And you'll possess the key that opens all the labyrinths. I will die And no one will remember me No, Lis. I'll remember you. I'll visit your grave with a flower and a dog. During your funeral, I'll sing that song, "How beautiful is a funeral". I'll do it for you, Lis. Speak to me, Lis. Speak to me, Lis. Speak to me, Lis. WHEN THE REFLECTION FADED AWAY IN THE MIRROR, IT GAVE WAY TO THE WORD, "FREEDOM"
