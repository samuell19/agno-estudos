Andt hough he sat within the icy domes of yon far Schreckhorn, ay, or higher, where veil'd since eternitythe Jungfrau soars, still to the tyrant would I make my way, with 20 comrades minded like myself, I'd lay his fastness level to the earth! And if none follow me, and if you, in terror for your homesteads and your herds, bow in submission to the tyrant's yoke, 'round me will call the herdsmen, aloud this foul enormity to proclaim! By order of the King, the actor who distinguished himself in yesterday's play, is to be at the ready for a private performance. His incomparable voice will carry His Majesty into history. I shall go to Switzerland with the actor. He is going on a journey. - Where? To the original locations of Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell". Kainz is to recite scenes for him. Kainz? - The new man. An actor. It's said he's got a great career ahead of him. The question is what kind of career. His Majesty intends to travel under the name "Marquis de Saverny". Incognito. "Marquis", doesn't sound bad. Also the actor will be travelling with false papers as "Monsieur Didier". Like in Victor Hugo, with cloak and dagger. On the Alpine meadows. Fist day of the journey. Instructions. The special train shall arrive at 10 a. m. in Ebikon near Lucerne. Due to dynamite left from blasting, the train shall travel at a crawl through tunnels. The tracks will be checked before passage. Strict incognito based on Number 4 of the Royal Travel Regulations! Why are we travelling so slowly? Maier, Weber, I'm cold. Marquis de Savemy, I hope you had a pleasant journey. The carriage, everything is ready. Monsieur Didier. Instructions. Continuation of the journey by special steamer on Lake Lucerne. During the entire sojourn the engines are to be kept at full steam, day and night, and ready at all times to sail. Curtains in the rear salon are to remain drawn, even during the day. I'm at a loss Marquis, I don't know how to explain the ship's delay. I do not wish to have encounters with travellers ornatives during my stay. - Very well. I wish to travel alone. Didier, I have brought you here faraway from our Royal Theater in Munich, yet it seems to me as though the real spectacle should begin here. You will recite forme from Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell". For you and for me alone. At the original locations. Wilhelm Tell, there where it really happened. In the autumn you will play Melchtal. I'm to play Melchtal! I'm delighted. Indeed, all the great dramas ofSchiller... Carlos... Ferdinand... Please go now and begin to prepare. Instructions. Overnight in the Grand Hotel Axenstein near Brunnen. Didier shall occupy the Royal Suite. His Majesty wishes to lodge on one of the upper floors. Didierand Savemy will only then be able to have an ideal friendship when they are subject to the same conditions. The Minister President is urgently waiting for a decision. I do not want to be disturbed with state affairs during this journey. Only the most necessary matters. Yes, Your Majesty. At your service. You look like a sourpuss. Areal Lord Chamberlain. Incognito. If you please! I wish you a good night. Herrenchiemsee Palace. His Majesty wishes that from now on all the theaters, palaces and parks, as well as wintergardens and grottos, be equipped with all the advances of science and technology, and be decorated by the most outstanding artists, in order for a world of feeling and beauty to emerge. Your Majesty, the engineer Siemens asked to be admitted. He's already been waiting for over four hours. Oh, yes. Remain behind the door during your report. Never look directly into His Majesty's eyes. Speakin an even tone and not loudly. Your Majesty, the installation in the Court Theater in Munich, is, save for the one in Berlin, the largest lighting system in Germany. The Marstallstrasse installation produces the electrical current. It consists of6 large Edison dynamos, 5 of which are capable of lighting 450 Edison lamps, each with the power of 16 light candles, and a 250 Edison with the same illuminating strength. The smaller of the machines is used to provide daylighting. In addition, 2.500 Edison lamps with their glowing carbon filaments illuminate the stage and auditorium. Now if I may present Your Majesty with a demonstration object? Nature grows too slowly! The set designer Janke has produced a sketch. The fake hedges will stretch half a klometer out onto the lake and be illuminated. In the unfinished north wing mannequins will be set up wearing Louis XIV costumes. The engineer of the Court Theater, Lautenschl?ger, has been commissioned to install the illumination. I thank you. Second day of the journey. Morning, 5 o'clock, departure by steamer. Scene to be recited: act II, scene 2. Confederates take the oath at sunrise. Recite! By this fair light which greeteth us before all other nations, that beneath us far, in noisome cities pent, draw painful breath, swear we... swear we the oath to our confederacy. A band of brothers... Pardon... A band of brothers true we swearto be, never to part death... never to part in death nor danger. We swear we will be free, as were our sires, and sooner die than live in slavery! We swear to put our trust in... God Most High, and not to quail before the might ofman. The recitation did not please His Majesty, did it? His Majesty has no time for petty bourgeois in their Sunday best. Keep that in mind. You must speak as if you were on stage. Here you are on stage, sir! But here it's cold and damp and I haven't had more than 3 hours sleep. Nature means nothing to us, Herr Kainz. Transformation is everything! You must transform nature for His Majesty. That is what he expects from you. I want to tell you a little story. One day, during a snowstorm, The King had his meal served to him outdoors. During this he imagined himself at the seaside, with the sun and heat. Now that's an imagination! Work on it, Court Actor. This isn't a pleasure cruise! Try to remember, when you recite, you're glimpsing deep into the souls of the heroes. If only I could get a glimpse into His Majesty's soul. I don't understand today's instructions either. They're full of riddles. Look here, 10 + 11 = 12, in parenthesis 21. I don't understand it. The 21st is the anniversary of King Louis XVI's death. His Majesty tries to avoid this unlucky number whenever possible. You khow, Herr Marstallfourier, it's very important forme to play Melchtal in Munich. The doors will be open for you... Hamlet, Romeo! All the great roles! Aword of advice: give His Majesty the sensation he expects from you. Act, Court Actor, act as deeply moved as you possible can. Hurl the words out of you like lightening! But why 10 + 11? After the doubled year of 18? That makes 36. - 36, that's how old the King is. At 18 he ascended the throne. Our Marquis has thought up a new game. A new game? Or is it the old one? If you're right, we'll be standing watch all night. Keep watch. Keep watch. Why is he always awake? What's he doing there? And what are you doing behind closed doors? Hey! Aletter! You keep secrets from me? It's from the Court Actor. I forgot to send it. Axenstein, June 29, 1881. "Dearest Little Mother... " Tell me, my son. "We arrivedy esterday morning at 10 in Ebikon, then by carriage we continued to St. Niklausen, quite a stir there. Being incognito is of course hell. " Quite a stir? "Then we took a special steamer directlyto R?tli. The Kingwill have me play Schiller and also Victor Hugo. It is heavenly here! You may not write to me. Seppl. " For Didier! The instructions for the actor. - Give them to me. You stay here. I'll give them to him. Third day of the journey. Original location. At 10 o'clock in front of the ruins of Attinghausen Castle. The Marquis wishes to view the scene from an elevated position. The distance to the actor maybe no less than 18 feet. Scene to be recited: act I, scene 4. In that direction, three steps to the right. Three steps to the right, Didier! And act I, scene 4. Act I, scene 4. Nought but his staff to the old eyeless man! Stripp'd ofhis all, even of the light of day, the common blessing of the meanst wretch... Tell me no more of patience, of concealment! Oh, what a base and coward thing am I, that on my own security I thought, and took no care of thine. Thy precious head left as a pledge within the tyrant's grasp! Hence, craven hearted prudence, hence! And all mythought be vengeance, and the despot's blood! I'll seek him straight... no power shall stay me now... And at his hands demand my father's eyes! I'll beard him 'mid a thousand myrmidons! What's life to me, if in his heart's best blood I cool the feverof this mighty anguish. Divine. It appears he was more pleased with my creation today. His Majesty is in a good mood. If I may say, Monsieur Didier was extremely impressive today. You hurled out the words like lightening bolts. The magic of your voice, it opens the gates of an ideal realm forus. Alone the suggestion in yourvoice. You valet dogs! I'd onlylike to knowwhat he sees in these old stones. The mysterious harmony we find here you don't see, Didier?. Nature has retrieved her share of man's feats. In these ruins historyis wnitten, as a second, as a highernature, as a... ...as an enduring sign, only visible to us. And where the plebeian only sees decay and dilapidation, the traces of a proud royal dynasty bear witness for all time. Herrenchiemsee palace. I hereby commission Court Architect Hofmann to erect a summerpalace in the Chinese style on the Plansee. Furthermore, I wish to have a report on the customs and etiquette ofthe Chinese court. Absolute monarchy must gain prevalence again. Your Majesty. Herr Hofmann. Today I can present His Majesty with a first draft of the Chinese summer palace at Plansee. Thank you. The Great Hall of Harmony was only used for certain grand ceremonies. The Emperor would be carried in a litter up the sloping, dragon decorated marble slab. The steps on both sides were used by ordinary mortals. Surrounded by bronze phoenixes and dragons symbolizing Earth an Heaven, he would receive reports. Only on red paper could petitions be presented, brought on bended knees. Everyone approached the Divine One with several kowtows, touching the forehead to the ground, and then remain humbly kneeling. All the servants were eunuchs. Traditionally the Emperor had 3000 eunuchs, the princes 30 each. Very good. I will introduce the Chinese court ceremony. Petitions only on red paper! I have made a second draft ofthe Byzantine palace in Graswangtal based upon His Majesty's specifications. Always plans and drafts. Do you actually know, Hofmann, that the government wants to boycott furtherwork on all new projects? And all this fuss over a ridiculous couple of million! I... I should have the entire govemment deported to America! Fourth day of journey. Garden of the Villa Gutenberg. Tent. From high up in the mountains, beginning at 11 o'clock, the alpine horns should ringforth. "Dearest Little Mother! We moved into the villa the day before yesterday. Thank God, he's finally satisfied here. But it is really heavenly... " Isn't he too pleased with himself? "I live in 3 sumptuously decorated rooms with a view of the lake. Yesterday I sawA ttinghausen Castle and the room where the Melchtal scene takes place. I'm doing very well but I must close, the Marquis has just called forme. A thousand kisses from he who loves you above all else, Seppl. If only you could be here!" Monsieur Seppl had better watch out! He doesn't knowhow quickly things can change. How beautiful, the alpine horns. How happy these simple people are, while our life is complicated with things I don't like to mention anymore. It ruins my very existence. But Your Majesty can take and leave what you will. Abdicate, if you wish. Abdicate, I, the King? Do not ever speak like that again! Never again! Didier, please describe the landscape forme. But Marquis, you need only have the curtains drawn open, then you could view the landscape with your own eyes. You didn't understand me. Describe how you see it. With your voice, the emotion will be even stronger. The craggy shore of Lake Lucerne. A secluded, wild wooded area. A brook cascades steeply downward, its spray veiling the sharp, strangely shaped cliffs. Directly on the shore a small chapel. - That must be the Tell Chapel. The frescos, we shall have a look at the new frescos. Hesselschwerdt! We want to dock. We shall visit the Tell Chapel. Your Majesty, we can't possibly dock here. There isn't any pier. Then have one built! Didier, you shall go ashore and give me a report of your impressions. We've found the painter. His name is St?ckelberg. He will explain the artistic intentions to you. Let him enter. Your Majesty, it gives me great pleasure and it is a special honor, to receive Your Majesty in the Tell Chapel. I am not... The wall paintings depict the most important scenes of the founding of Switzerland. As you see, I have used the al fresco technique. "Al fresco?" Indeed, Your Majesty. I do not want to be presumptuous, even the great Michelangelo... I'd like to say, the decisive results emerge, so it seems to me, from an essential need, like the Last Judgment. History, in its broad current, onlytolerates a fleeting correction of the moment, of a blind spot oralong the edge. It is the same fora fresco painter. Once everything is set in stone and paint, in time and event, I can't be changed unless you redo everything. Well, that would be something! Let's redo everything. I mean, let's rewrite history. And... did it really happen like that? Who knows? Is it really important? Isn't the beautiful picture we artists make of history so much more important? An impression of how it might have been an ideal condition. A rainbow at dawn. Herrenchiemsee Palace. Ways and means must be found so I may view all places and parks from every perspective, especially from above. Photographs are to be taken ofthe most important views. You are a true artist, Albert. - Thankyou,Your Majesty. I have a newtaskforyou. I expect you backin three months. You shall take a photograph of me flying across the lake in a peacock carriage at dawn. Suspended from a cable, like a funicular. Everything will be inspected by an engineer. Your Majesty, I am ready. Very good! Very, very good! Thank you, Your Majesty. You report on the flying machine! - ift o pleases Your Majestyto look. An endless cable shall run from two fixed points. A balloon fastened to this cable will lift the gondola. Shifting winds at both ends could then pull the balloon back and forth between the two points. However, there are still certain questions that demand meticulous investigation. 1.) What kind of cable can be used, and what dimension must it have, to provide security? 2.) What dimension must a hydrogen filled balloon have to be able to bear 2000 to 3500 kilograms, including the weight of the gondola? 3.) What complications should we fear could occur during the excursion between the two points? Fifth and sixth day of the journey. Recitation at the look-out. Every object what disturbs the field of vision, especially the boat house, is to be covered. Act 1, scene 4. Young Melchtal's transformation while crossing overthe eternal ice. Only through suffering can Didier and Melchtal become one. And though he sat within the icy domes ofyon far Schreckhorn ay, or higher, where veil'd since etemity, the Jungfrau soars, still to the tyrant I would make my way, with 20 comrades minded like myself, I'd lay this fastness level to the earth! And if none follow me, and if you all in terror for your homesteads and your herds, bow in submission to the tyrant's yoke, round me I'll call the herdsmen on the hills, and there beneath heaven's free and boundless rood, where men still feel as men, and hearts are true, proclaim aloud this foul enormity! Thank you, Didier. From now on you will no longer act. We want more than art. You will be Melchtal! The letters of the alphabet disappear, the riddle solves itself. We shall wait in the first village after the Joch Pass. You shall cross the Surenen Pass today, and tomorrow the Joch Pass, which lies behind it. Didier, come here. I have a present for you. Choose one. Which do you like best? Oh, I like both of them. Then take them both. This is the only historic site on this entire track. Here, on this spot, Melchtal set foot. An interesting thought, Herr Court Actor. Please recite for us. Please let us have the pleasure. Your voice, Didier! I slacked my thirst on the oozings of the glacier heights that through the crevices come foaming down... Through the Surenen's fearful mountain chain, where dreary ice fields stretch on either side, and sound is none, save for the hoarse vulture's cry. I can't anymore. Why is he making me climb this miserable mountain? He wants to test me... and I'll pull through. I should solve the riddle. Good. What's he talking about? 33, 3 x 3 = 9... the number of steps to the throne. The number of steps to the throne. Monsieur Didier. Monsieur Didier! Let me sleep! Monsieur Didier! Sir, it's already quite late. We've got to get a move on. I can't! Ifwe are to cross the Joch Pass and meet His Majesty, we need to move now. Everything hurts. My back, my feet. I don't want to get up. You certainly don't want to disappoint His Majesty! Order a carriage for 12 o'clock. Then we'll be on the ship this afternoon with the King. But... Leave me peace! I'll leave at 12! - Monsieur Didier. There you are, Didier. I waited in vain for you at the Joch Pass. What happened? Marquis, I shall tell you straight away about our experiences. We ascended to the world of eternal ice where summer and winter have no form. Time stood still while we climbed through the perpetually gleaming snow. Up here the heroic is frozen in eternity. We saw the restlessness of forms, the chaos of hulking masses, the transparent, shimmering icy slopes, the snow capped peaks with no connection to the world. We experienced an alienation of all life. We arrived in Engelberg exhausted. I realize now, dear Didier, that no effort is for nought. Please sit down. You see, no great art can develop without trial and preparation. We shall now sail to R?tli, and at sundown you shall recite the oath scene for me, agreed? Yes. Your Majesty, the actor has fallen asleep. He appears to be completely exhausted. Incomprehensible! He didn't even cross the Joch Pass and he has no strength left. How useless human nature is! The actor is only the facade of his play. If shaken, it collapses. Yes, it's been like that everytime, hasn't it, Hesselschwerdt? We are approaching the R?tli, shall I wake him? Oh, no. No, please. Let him sleep. We shall return to Brunnen. Linderhof Palace. The travel writer Franz von L?her is to be commissioned to sell the Kingdom of Bavaria and seek a suitable territory for a new kingdom. Attention is to be directed to an island with tropical vegetation and exceptional animal life. Herr von L?her should arrive Monday, at 1 o'clock at night, at the Moorish Kiosk. May I present Your Majesty with the report of my last journey? The purchase of a new territory is for reasons, several reasons, very difficult to realize. Moreover, Your Majesty, the sale of the Kingdom of Bavaria may prove to be extremely difficult. An island such as Majorca would require an amount of 50 million. I have a new task for you. After each journey you shall report to me promptly. A tremendous honor, Your Majesty. One need not travel anymore to experience particular sensations. See for yourself! Costa Rica, Venezuela, the Philippine Islands Javanese Madura, the Nile Valley, the Hindu Kush Valley in Afghanistan and in Columbia the Cauca valley. Come on! Seventh day of the journey. Three o'clock at night. Meeting in the tent. Promenade and reading. Didier! Marquis, is there anything I can do for you? No, no. The Alps make me a bit tired. It seems to me the same goes for you. Me... Tell me the truth. What's bothering you? I'm exhausted. Yes... your voice. You must spare your voice. We'll take a day off to rest. Two days, to recuperate. Eighth day of the journey. After the hardships of the Surenen Pass, travel by cog rail up the Rigi Mountain. The famous sunrise. Aurora as in act II, scene 2. Allow me to introduce myself, Mademoiselle. Monsieur Didier. Mytwo servants shall take charge of your luggage, if you wish. That is very considerate of you, sir. - Take it into the hotel! I noticed you reading Mark Twain. Are you on the trail of the famous sunset? I'm going to test if the sunset really has the described effect. And I'm here for the sunrise, but I very much hope to meet you at the performance of its setting. It won't be easy not to meet here on the summit. What could he possibly be doing? - He seems confused. Or am I mistaken? You're not mistaken. Nature... he's overwhelmed by the sight of nature! Mademoiselle! - Monsieur Didier, you're also here for the sunset? Or are you spending the night in order not to miss the sunrise tomorrow?. You khow, these sunrises and sunsets... As if the sun sets differently here than anywhere else in the world. You believe in the mysticism of numbers? A friend's letter. He gives me riddles which I have solve. Oh, what an interesting friendship. This looks like an anagram... Tmeicost Ettal. The actor wants us to be ready to go to Vitznau in an hour. So what? On foot! To descend to Vitznau on foot? "Dear Mother, yesterday evening we left Brunnen by carriage for Arth, then continued on to Rigi-Kulm... magnificent sunset! Slept splendidly and of course overslept the sunrise. " That's something. Did he say anything to you about that? "We will be leaving soon. Write me... Monsieur Didier, Brunnen, Pension Mythenstein. Didier. " Nowhe really believes he's Didier! If the young lady is to blame for his oversleeping? - Hardly. The King will never forgive him for missing the sunrise. There you're right, for a change. I'll give him a week! At the most. And he, he's sparing his voice! We should have declined. Refused! She, a tourist! - And the luggage! I knew it. I saw it coming. I wonder if one can see Italy from here? I'm quite sure you can. You promised to tell me about your mysterious friend. Just a little. Please... He is... Savemy. Ah! The Marquis de Savemy. And yourtask, what about your task? He has me recite Schiller. Dear Miss, at length I have you alone. In a wild dell, surrounded by cliffs, no jealous eye can watch our interview. Now let my heart throw off this weary silence. See, yonder goes the chase! Now then, or never! Didier, tell me about the Rigi. I can hardly wait. Well, since they built a hotel on the summit, tastes have changed. Visitors spend the night on the summit and are not compelled anymore to make the dangerous ascent in the dark. One enjoys the more impressive sunset that way. - No, the sunrise! The report, if you please. The sunrise? I... I couldn't see it. How? Didier! It's... it's simply too early in the moming. I overslept. Overslept? Act II, scene 2? We can simply repeat it, like in the theater. The King's commands are no longervalid? Ninth day of the journey. In the evening, arrival at the R?tli. The oath swearing scene by firelight. Everything is ready as planned. The oath scene! - The mystery! I can't. The voice won't come. Everything inside me is contracted. Such a... darkness! It's me Didier, your friend, at you side. Recite for me. For me alone. But it's not possible when the voice won't come. You will recite. What I requested from my friend Didier, you, the Court Actor... I command! I, the King! Recite! No. I'm tired. If you're tired, then go to sleep! Linderhof Palace. His Majesty wishes to experience everything in one place. To achieve this, the grotto must be equipped with devices that can create the most diverse weather conditions. He wishes to have a sunrise with aurora and a storm with thunderclaps. The light should correspond to that of the Blue Grotto of Capri. The chemist Adolf von Bayer is to present his report at Linderhof on Friday. Herr von Bayer, it's absolutely necessary this matter be addressed in quite a different manner. I've already made the necessary arrangements. In the last few years there's only been backwards movement. It's a disgrace! Everything must be finished in May. The lighting was equipped with combinations ofburnt red glass and aniline blue coated plates. In general the choice of colors can be considered a success. However, the blue does not appear to be entirely pure, which is all the more disturbing since the eye, when exposed over a length of time to a color becomes insensitive to it. Your Majesty, I was able to expandthe system. On the wave-making machine, by means of a special transmission device, it is possible to regulate the waves to hit in short and rapid intervals. This allows for an intensification of the lighting effects. In addition there is a wind machine, a phonograph and a magic lantern. Now the actor has finally seen the dawn. And what good will that do him? The rising sun, the setting sun, for him it's all theatrical artifice. And our master plays the director. And you, you're a bad extra. Should I presume you want to speak to the King, Monsieur Didier?. I am not Didier! It is his Majesty's instruction. I don't care! I'm an actor and not a... And as forthese instructions, you may not believe it possible, but I've had them up to here! He wants to do an experiment with me, a symmetrical one! Good. But this collection of bloodless literary figures, and then these numbers, here! 1291! Tell's birthday, probably! 1638.What do I know. Didier and Savemy, the ideal sensation! 1881, 1-8-8-1, cross sum of 9! I'm not in a position to reveal this, but itis not the first time His Majesty has undertaken such a journey. Indeed you know he finds real feeling onlyin doubling literary figures. I'm an actor, Hesselschwerdt! He means well. In doubling literary figures? Only in this way can two persons so distant in rank and station come togetherin an ideal friendship. Believe me, Kainz, there are only a few artists who are lucky enough to have His Majesty's favor. You kho wwhat, Hesselschwerdt? I'm beginningto wonder if that can really be called luck. By orderofthe King! For Herr Kainz. End of the journey. New meeting in Lucerne, at the Panorama. Be glad, Didier. Now you can be an ordinary actor and sleep your fill every morning. Your predecessors made much more out of the situation. Do you know Wagner's house in Tribschen? You always knewbetter, you two, from the very beginning. You valet dogs! Now, now, Court Actor. Are we hearing that famous voice which arouses the noble feelings? Kiss my ass! Loftiness has its price. That much we knew. We knew thatbefore you did. How could I be both at once, Melchtal and Didier? When I was Melchtal, he was the Marquis and when I was Didier, he was the King. Your Majesty, I am not worthy. After all the favor you have shown me in your boundless generosity I no longer consider myself... It's alright. Let us walk. I no longer want to travel. Nature is no longer reliable neither is the countryside, the weather and not even the escorts. Beauty, by its verynature, is susceptible to every trouble, Majesty. That's just it. One should be able to hold everything fixed, like it is here. We are standing in the center. We are the center, and all that happens revolves around us, but at a proper distance. A painted theater but certainly only a mocktheater without players without voices! Dear friend, there are no players anymore, no walk-ons from history. Everyone makes history himself ho wand when he likes, whole or in part. I don't need you anymore, Herr Kainz, but we want to remember this journey. Come! Didier. Yes, Marquis. - Put your hand on my shoulder. But Marquis... - I request it, please. Now you sit, please. One will think I had profited from the situation. In the photograph showing Didier and Savemy after their Swiss journey, Kainz's arm resting on Ludwig's shoulder was later erased. After this last journey, Ludwig never allows the court actor into his presence. The King withdraws into his world of palaces and castles. Josef Kainz becomes a celebrated actor in Berlin.
