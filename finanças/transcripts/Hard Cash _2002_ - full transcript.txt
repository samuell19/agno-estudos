Let's go! Look, I thought you were going to get us out of here. Look, see... look, nothing even works. I can't say anymore. It's OK, Paige, we can stay a little longer. I appreciate that. I guess, that's the thanks I get for wiping your nose the last year. -Paige. No, I understand. You have your daughter. You two, together. The thing I don't see is how I fit in here. Maybe you should fix that focet. Paige, what are you doing here? Listen, I've already hired another gal, I've given your shift away. I'm not here to work. Can you get me a vodka straight up, no ice? Sure. Hey, you don't look so good. Whats wrong? I'm fine. I need a double. Do you work on the day shift today, sugar? A little early for vodka, isn't it? Well, it's not too early to mind your own fucking business, is it? -Got it. Paige, it's for you. For me? Hello? So, what'd you do at school today? Well, I did math, but that's just boring. Yeah, I always hated math. What'd you do all that time you were away? I thought about you, Paige, about life in general. You ever think about my mommy? Yeah, all the time. She was a beautiful lady, your mom. I miss her every day. Paige took good care of me while you were gone. But she's so young. Well, I'm glad you like her. You want a soda? Get, uh, two sodas. -Sure. Listen, Megan, I, uh... I'm sorry I wasn't able to be there for you. It's OK, Daddy, I'm not stupid. I know you were in jail. And I know you want to get us out of the trailer park. I'm just afraid of how you're going to do it. What are you talking about? Come on, Daddy, I know you're up to something. I just don't know what. -Hey, you can't do that. -Why not? Because it's stealing? Let's go get a seat. Right here. Listen, I want you to know something. I can't live like this. I'm afraid of you going back to jail. The thought of my daddy being a thief.

I'm not a thief, but I was going to launder it a little bit and make a little money on the side. And then you come along and steal it. The very worst thing to happen to me, you ruined my life. The worst thing to happen to me turned out to be the best thing. We're going to be partners. -You're kidding me. -Nope. Never been more serious in my life. I was tracking you down, your name came up under the smart guys. No, you're good. Yep, you're perfect. Listen, I know you smoke, so, uh, I got some for you. I put them over there on the counter, help yourself. Thanks, but I don't do that anymore. You quit, really? I know, they're killer. How'd you do it? The... the... the patch? Just tell me what the hell you want. OK. Every night a secure boat comes into the docks with the profits from the casinos in Atlantic City. They get transferred to an armored car. Now, I got a special set up on Saturday where there's going to be six million large, at least, totally untraceable. So what, you want me to deliver you the money, then I get my kid back, right? You're a good thief, Taylor. I respect you. If this all works out, it's the beginning of a long and prosperous future together. You kidnapped my daughter, I don't see us having a real bright future. Oh, come on, that's just a formality. You just prove yourself trustworthy, she'll be back in your arms on Saturday night. Listen, it's up to you. But this is perfect. I've got all the contacts, can't get busted. Totally secure information. You do the heist, I set up the gigs, split everything 50-50. You'll be able to buy your daughter whatever she wants. I think 50-50's fair, don't you? I can't do this job alone. No, you need your crew. Whatever you want. They won't do it. I think the stuff there in the envelope, that'll little help convince them. Is this money from the OTB heist? How'd you get it back? Come on, your tax dollars hard at work, it's what I do... surveillance. Yeah, well, I'm not going to take it. It's too risky. Listen, why don't you give me back my kid? You don't need her, you got me. I'm going to the job for you anyway. Please, I can't do it unless I know she's safe. I'll be in touch. Stay with the money. Stupid. Yeah? Stupid, stupid. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Yeah, get Megan on the phone. Put her on the phone! Now, here. What the hell are you doing? What am I doing? I'm being a nice guy, I'm letting you say goodbye to your daughter. Please, please, don't do that. All right, you don't have to kill her. I'm going to do the job for you. Please. Hand on. Is this any way to start a partnership? I'm sorry. Are you? Very, very sorry. I'm disappointed. Call you back. I went to pick up Megan from school today but she wasn't there. I dropped her off this morning. She's missing. -I know. You OK? Just tell me nothings going to happen to Megan. Tell me. Oh my God. Oh, you scared the shit out of me. Do you want a beer? -No. You got it all figured out? How you doing? Just great. You don't look great. You look worried. You got a plan? How about the guys with the guns? The corrupt cops? You got enough guys? How about your crew? Maybe you're not so smart. -I don't know. I, uh...I got it all figured out. You know, Megan asked about all the time. I said, uh, you're away on a trip and you're working hard, but, uh... you might be away for a long, long time. Because I just can't get this out of my head. You know, you trying to follow my at the hotel. That... that... that... that was, uh... that wasn't smart, and I got to trust you. I could tell, I'm going to be up all night thinking about this. And I'm no good without sleep either. I don't know, I could do anything, like, I'm just... what are you like without sleep? Not good. I'm like... I'm like mush... like... like a... like a mush man. Sleep easy. This is, uh... this isn't going to be a problem. Yeah? Well, great. I feel better already. My man, Taylor. Here's the next time and place. Smoke? No. Want to get a beer, talk about this? No. Can't. There's no one watching Megan. I better get going. Any message? Just tell her I love her. I'll tell her you say that. She better be there, you son of a bitch. Hey, it's Taylor. I need you, my friend. I need you to be my contingency plan. Yeah, I know your price. Jesus. Paige! Ah, gee... Jesus, are you all right? You hurt? He thought we had the money. You did this? He attacked me and I screamed, and... then no one heard me so I started swinging. Come on, get yourself cleaned up. We're getting out of here now. Come on! Hurry up! Whoa... Jesus! You scared the hell out of me. Well, what you doing up so early? What's that there? We're just, uh, taking out a little trash, that's all. And, uh, sorry about all the noise last time. -I didn't hear no noise. -You didn't? What are y'all doing? You going somewhere? Uh... yeah, we're just taking a short vacation. We'll be back soon. Paige! Paige, get in the car. We got to go! We got to go! Come on. -Why? Come on. -What? -Nikita. There he is, and here we are. My fucking shoulders. Congratulations, Taylor, you're going to get a sheet, laundry, and a very quick alteration. Come on! Hold on. Hold on. Watch out for the fucking lake! What are you doing? Let's go! Let's go! Let's get out of here! You fucking stupid fucking idiota! You motherfucker! Answer the phone, Nikita, come on! Hey, you got a good driver there. You think it's funny? Relax, Conrad, I'm going to make this up to you. You're going to get your $2 million back, I just need to be my contingency plan. You want to hear my contingency plan? If my... -I'll be in touch. ...because of this $2 million. I'm going to cut your balls off, Taylor! OK? So, uh, thanks for finally calling. Did you bring my money? Where's our money? I brought you guys a message, and I wanted to give you your gun back. Who the fuck has my 2 mill? What the fuck's this mess? FBI guys, working on their own. They tracked us down. -What? -Why? -What? They were laundering money, we screwed it all up them. Remember the counter boss in the OTB? He had a heart attack. The autopsy connected the death to the robbery. What does this mean? That report hasn't been filed. It means we aren't wanted for murder, yet. What? Felony murder rule. That want us to pull a job for them. $6 million payoff. -No fucking way. I didn't get paid for the first one. This is bullshit, brother. Let's Just take off. Baby, let's just run to Mexico. I know, we get married. Taylor. Taylor. Oh, big brother, I want my fucking money. Listen, these are dirty FBI guys. We don't do this for them, they're going to track us down one by one. They're not going to get me. Come on. I'm going to get arrested. Taylor. They might not want to arrest you, Butch. What are you talking about? Holy shit. That looks like Rock. It is Rock. Oh my, God. We got one shot at this, so let's get it right. Butch, there's an empty repair shop down by the docs, I want you to get a hold of an arc welder. And make sure it's a cheap one, all right, this is the last of my cash. Virginia, buy yourself a sexy outfit with a short skirt. Shorter than usual? I'll meet you guys on the steps of the old post office around 11. I'll tell you the rest of the plan then. What about me? What do I do until then? Just do what you normally do, whack off. I'm serious. What do I do? Just doing what you normally do. So what do you think of Taylor's big story? Think he's telling the truth? Huh? With those FBI guys, I think he's lying. No. It's too dangerous. I don't want the others know you and Megan exist. Hand me my vest. Who gives a shit. Huh? What? We're going to jack that money and give it to the Feds? Oh baby, I don't think so. We keep it for ourselves. Just me and you. Me and you! Me and you. $6 million. $6 million. -And you. Who's the little brother now? Who's the little brother now? Let's make it quick. -Sharp. -Move it. Just wait here. I'll be back soon. Taylor, be careful. -Let's go, boys, come on. -Clear. Evening, ma'am. Boy, oh, thank the lord in heaven, it's the 5-0. Howdy, y'all. How in tarnation did I end up at the water again? Lady, you're going to have to move your car out of the way. OK, baby, but could you just tell me where I can find Hershey... I don't know where Hershey is. It's Hershey PA where they make... I will, honey, but I just need to know where they make the sweet little chocolate. Watch out! We got to help those guys. Give me your hand. Come on. Butch, is that you? Oh yeah, baby. It's your Butch. Look at you. You look a little surprised. You're expecting Eddy, weren't ya? Double crossing bitch. Suck on that. At least your brother could deliver. The only testosterone you have is from the steroids you take, you fat... I told you to stay at the motel. Look, she's like my daughter too, OK? I can't just sit around a hotel room and wait for something to happen. Well, how'd you find me? I found a boat rental receipt in the wallet that you left behind. Catch. Thanks. Thanks for saving me, Paige. I told you, you couldn't trust those people. How about you? What are you talking about? The old lady, she didn't hearing anything the night Rock died. Why don't you tell me what really happened. Cornell's guy killed Rock. Why'd you lie to me? I didn't know what to do. Cornell told me that if... if I didn't show him where the OTB money was, he was going to send you back to jail. I had to work with him. So let me get this straight, Rock told you which PO box the money was in and then you told Cornell? I just... I figured that if I told him where the money was that he would leave us alone. I guess I was stupid to think that he would just go away. You've never been stupid, Paige. What, are you just saying that I'm just into this for the money? To tell you the truth, I don't know what to think anymore. Here, take the wheel. I know that I screwed up, but I can make it up to you. I know how. Look, there's his boat. You hide, and I'm going to take the money on board, OK? If you think I'm letting you get any where near this money, you're crazy. Move. Go on. You have to trust me, Taylor. Right. Ahoy, there. Daddy! Daddy! Save me! It's OK, sweetie, are you all right? -Daddy! -Get back inside. No. Let me go. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy, help! Give me a hand with this. I got the money, where's my daughter? Leave the money down there, you come on up. We had a deal. Well, now we got a new deal. Come on, we don't have all night. Paige, you stay in the boat. I'll be there in a minute. Why don't you go in the back, take a look-see. Daddy! Daddy, help me! Daddy, help! Daddy, help me! -It's OK, sweetie. It's all right. I'm going to get you out of there. It's OK. Actually it's not. There's enough explosives in that bomb to blow up a battle ship. And this remote gives me 90 seconds to get away to enjoy the fireworks. Jesus. Did you check the money? Yeah, boats... I hate them. Don't do this. You're doing it. Unlike you, I can't trust you. Besides, I got a new pregnant, one I can trust. What the fuck is this? Here's the contingency plan. You little shit! Daddy, get him! Judith. I know you don't believe me, but I waited for you. You don't actually think I'd be working with a lunatic like this, do you? -Lunatic? What is it with you two? Give me the remote. No. Don't make me shoot you. Gee, I was really looking forward to working with you. Shoot him. I'm just going to have to. Come on, shoot him. Blanks. You don't honestly think that I'd give you a loaded gun, do you? Do I look like an idiot? Paige! Get away from the boat. Swim! Don't! -Daddy! Sweetie, stay away from that thing. OK? Don't touch it. Just stay here by the door. It'd be a shame if I run over your girlfriend. Come on, Cornell, give me the key. I don't think so. Don't bother to try and break in. The cabin's secured. Push. Come on. Pull on the door. Pull, all right? Come on, we can do this. Come on. That's right, just... come on, pull the door. Hey, Cornell, why don't you give me one of those things. Ha, I knew you couldn't quit. Careful, those things are killers. It's a little late to worry about my health, isn't it? You know, something, you're right. Why's that? These things are killers. Daddy! Daddy! See if you can find something that will help me jimmy this lock, all right? Wallet. Go on, keep looking. Anything you can find in there. Don't touch the bomb! Don't touch the bomb! Jesus. You have anything on you? Anything in your purse? Anything at all? Come on, look, quick. See if you can slip it on right through here, all right? Slip it through here. Slip it right through the door. Slip it through the door. Hurry. Daddy, hurry. Daddy! Dad! I got it. I got it. Let's go. Let's go. Daddy! Oh, sweetie, you OK? Daddy, I freezing, it's so cold. OK. OK, we're going to get out of here. Paige. -Over here. What are you doing? Right here. Sweetie, we're right here. Damn you, Taylor. All right, that'll keep you above water. Just kick your feet. There you go. OK, be careful. Here we go. All right, grab her hands. Come on. Pull her up. That's it. Here. All right, wrap her up in this. Paige, you're all right. Taylor, over here. Over here. There's. Head over to him. Paige, take me. Take me. -Got him? Baby, now you got me. Work me, baby. Work me over. You little shit. We need keep track of you. There we go. Bon voyage. Daddy, I didn't... I didn't know. The man said that you sent him to pick me up from school. I didn't know. -It's OK, sweetie. It's all right. I'm just sorry I got you involved in this, sweetie, I'm sorry. Nice. Very nice. Wait, what is this? Where's the money? This is shredded paper. Don't sweat it, sweet cheeks, it's safe. Told you I wasn't going to let you near the money. I almost took off. But you didn't. You came back for us. Sorry, P, I know it's heart breaking, but that's my price. OK, well, that's your cut. Come on, baby, pile on another bundle. You know that shits wet. Uh, yeah, so are you. You bet I am, sweet heart. You got me all gravy and horny, so... uh, why don't you come over here and just warm me up. You little shit. Just throw in another one for him. OK. That's it. That's all I'm putting in. -Thanks, sweetie. You feel good. Thank God. Taylor, now we're square. Thanks. Absolutely. So long. Yeah, so long's right. Look at this money. We have so much money. What are we going to do? What are you doing? -It's stolen money. -No. Wait. No. No, don't! Don't! Oh my God, Taylor, we could have kept some of that. We coul... oh my God. Got to let it go. We could have done something with that, Taylor. Hey, it nearly cost me everything I care about. But, Taylor, it... I promised her. We're going to be OK. -Yeah? Yeah. Jesus Christ, who the fuck are you? Looks like contingency plan, Pablo. I should get the $2 million promised to me. -No, it's $2 million... no. -Look at this. Your suit is wet. It's a very big, big problem. Look, your suit is shrinking in the leg. I should look at it, I happen to be in the laundry business. Quick alteration, I'll be sleeping, you're perfect, no problem. Jesus Christ! Want on? Here. Lighter. Do you know why I love you, baby? Why? Because you bring out the best in me. Do you have any idea of what we're going to do when we get up to Canada? -What? What are we going to do? What? Tell me. Come on, Daddy. Yeah. Well, I got to make us some money. Fast. My name is Jose. I say, my name is Jose, and I kill people for money. My friend! Jose, there is no need to kill us. Come on, we are friends. Friends. Yeah. Good. Then I kill you for nothing!
