Oh... Ah. Why aren't you ready for track? I'm not going to tack, it's too hot. Oh, you're going. Oh, come on. Let's go, buddy. Come on. I got breakfast on the table. Let's go. Oh, I really wish I didn't have to go to work today. Please just stay home today. It's Saturday. Why do you have to go to work? Last minute client. Needs to be done today. I hate getting up early for dance. - What are you drawing there? - It's for Payton. Why are your candles so crooked? Because I don't like straight lines. Okay. That's a good answer. Okay. What you drawin' over there? It's for Payton's birthday party. Oh, it's so cute. But where is daddy? Can we make pancakes? No, baby, we don't have time. You got to go to dance. Good morning. You look great. - Dad. - Hm? I think it's time for you to upgrade from the Tyrannosaurus text. Tyrannosaurus text? Cute. No, I love my phone. I have no time or interest in those gadgets you kids play with. I see how you guys are on your telephones, walking into parked cars, playing Pokie-man. Pokie-man? That's cute. You can't play Pokie-man on a pager. This is a telephone and I only have to charge this telephone every few days. You guys are constantly plugged in. So why don't you go read a book or somethin'? All right, well, what if you want to know where every restaurant in Manhattan is, hm? What if I want to know where you are all day, every day? - Uh... - Anyway... Can you make pancakes? Pancakes. Coming right up. - Ah! - Turkey pancakes. All right, who's gonna eat this thing. I will! I love pancake lunches. Dad, um, you'll be home by three, right? - Please, daddy. - Okay, I'll be home by three. - Now get outta here. - Promise? - Yes, I promise. - Come on girls. I said let's go, let's gi, let's go. Let's go. Hut, hut, hut, hut. Hut, hut, hut. Michael! - Yeah? - Let's go! Would you pick up Payton's birthday cake after track? I'd appreciate it. The bakery's just way out of my way. Well, I can't today. After track, I have a math tutor. Math tutor? Why? You're not doing well in math? Yeah. Told you that like a month ago. Remember, you took my phone away? Yeah. Said being good at math is in our genes? Oh, I remember that now. I remember that now, Why didn't he ask me for help? 'Cause you're always on that damn phone. Well, I figured that because you're my father, maybe would have just helped me because I'm trying my best and it's- - I will help you next time, I promise. I'll ask your mom if she has time to get the cake. So anyway... How's track going? - It's fine. - Yeah? I'm fast, but this one kid's got me beat and I'm pretty sure it's just because of his expensive running shoes. Really? Expensive running shoes? - You know what I think? - What? I think success is earned, it's never given- - Okay. - And I would bet money that kid's on track more than you are. I'm not mad, you're just wrong, okay? He's never even been at practice. So you think if I buy you those shoes that you'll be able to beat him? Oh, 100%. I'll tell you what, you score 100 on your next math quiz, I will buy those shoes and I'll be at your next competition where you're wearing those shoes. I mean my next exam is Monday. Better get started, pal. Are you serious? Don't play with me, okay? - I'm gonna need your help. - I'm serious. Go to track. All right. I'll see you when you get home. Good morning. Good morning. You're new, huh? I am new. I'm James. How you doing, James? There you go, buddy. - Hey, what's this? - That's my kid's lunch. He left it, you can have it. - Are you sure? - Positive. I didn't grab breakfast this morning. Thank you. Good for me. I'll be back at 1:30 for the car. - You got it. - Thanks, buddy. Thanks again. Hey, good morning. Good morning, Yarge. What are you doing here on Saturday? Work, work, work. Got to do it. If you need anything, let me know. Just give me a call on the cell phone. Thanks, buddy. Hm. - Good morning, Susan. - Morning, Roman. Have you written up that agreement for the Brooklyn ad campaign? Not just yet. I have a feeling they're going to give this to someone else. Oh how funny. Look, you get 'em on the phone, tell 'em you need to right away, whether they like it or not. I've been working on it all night, barely slept. And we came in on a Saturday so they could have it tomorrow. Get them on the phone. They're signing it. How do you do that? Sound reason and threats. This is what I live for. My specialty is to convince. I just can't convince my family how important this work is, especially Mike. Thank you, dear. That's how it is in everyone's life. I really don't have time to do all this paperwork today, not to mention, I don't want to get upset. It's Payton's birthday. I'm supposed to go get the cake and the pizza and I have to get there early to take her her gift. What are you guys doing? Having a party at the house. Her friends from school and dance class. A little tutu brigade all day. She was so excited this morning. We're going to have a bunch of kids run in the house all day. Oh, good. I'll be at my desk if you need anything. Thank you, doll. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ To you ♪ ♪ To you ♪ ♪ To you ♪ Lily? Yes? That was a really beautiful painting that you did this morning. But where was daddy? Because daddy's always working. Well, daddy's working so we can have this house and birthday parties and presents. Yeah, but daddy doesn't even know my favorite color. Every time I draw him a picture, he doesn't even look at it. Honey, he loves your pictures. He has them hanging in his office. I don't think so. Does daddy know your favorite color, mommy? Yeah, of course he does. I think so. It's teal blue. That's a pretty color. It is, yeah. I like this color, or this color. You know what I think? I think we should all have some more bonding time. You know, mommy used to be an artist. Like me? Like you, honey. Where should we hang this? Up there. Okay. - Go grab tape. - Okay. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - You're so funny. - I know. It's so pretty. Look what we did. I know. One second. But you think it needs a little glitter, mommy? It does. Let's go to your room and add some glitter. Okay. So what's with these smartphones, anyway? What's with them? Yeah, my kids were giving me a bad time this morning for having a flip phone. Well, flip phones are just about extinct. Thank you very much. And a smartphone has pretty much everything you need to sustain life. To sustain life? So it grows food? No, but you can order food on it. Yeah? Okay, what's this video call? How does that work? You just call a number and you can see the person. Yeah? Let's call Mike. I think Mike's smart enough not to pick up. Oh, come on. Let's try it. - Okay. - Cool. Except I can't get it on the phone now. There we go. Hello? Hello? Mike. It's me. Dad? Where are you? I'm outside running laps. What's up? Oh, I can see. Cool. Just text me. Wait, wait, wait. - I just want- - Just text. I got to go. Text me. See? He doesn't trust you. He's very distant. You can tell. I guess that's where my father was with me. Never affection, always giving orders. You're going to have a real hard time when that boy grows up. He's a really good kid. - He really is. - Do you ever tell him that? He knows it. Okay, that's my cue. I'm going to go. Do you need anything else? No, I'm good. Okay, the super's leaving the building at one. You'll be the only one in the building. Okay. The only one in the building. Let's go baby. Come on, let's go get the cake, - let's go get the cake! - I know. We're late already. One second. Okay! - Buckle up. - Okay! ♪ I'm a birthday cake ♪ ♪ I'm havin' fun ♪ ♪ I'm a birthday cake, it's true ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I love you ♪ ♪ I'm a birthday cake ♪ ♪ I'm havin' fun ♪ ♪ I'm a birthday cake ♪ Let's go. Hello. Here for pickup. I just cleaned that display case. Okay, relax, she's just a kid. Yeah. I'm just a kid. What's the order under? It's Roman. It says Happy Birthday Payton. You don't have a ticket number? My husband had it. It should be under the name Nicole or Roman. Okay, I can call my husband for the ticket number. I'll try. Just give me a minute. I don't have a birthday cake for Payton, but I have one for Lily. For me? You know, my husband must have made a mistake. It's supposed to say Payton. Any chance you can change the name? Can you spell that for me? It's spelled P-A-Y-T-O-N. Thank you. Can she have one? Do you want a cupcake? Yes, please. Which one would you like? That one, with the unicorn and don't look a mistake. Let me out. Let me out. One second. Come on, Missy. Look at your face. Who painted this? I didn't paint it, it's my cupcake. Let's go. We have to hurry, it's her birthday. One second. Let me open the car. It's locked. Here, do you need help? - I can help you. - Yes, please. Better hurry. Okay. Buckle up. Hey, what's the big idea? Did you eat cake already? I just had a cupcake. Oh. Well, how was it, kid? It was good. We had chips and cookies. Did you learn anything new? Not really. Okay, once we get home, you really need to change this. I'm ready. You know, I mean, you're not going to wear this. Why don't you put the dress? I don't want to wear that raggedy old dress. It doesn't even look nice on me. Dad promised me he'd take me to get a new dress. Well, we all knew it was not going to happen, so I guess we're just going to make do. Lily. - Mommy, let me out. - One second. - Mommy. - I'm coming, I'm coming. Mommy! - Let me out! - Come on. - Liliana stop. - Sugarface. Quit whining. You quit whining. Don't start, you guys. Lily, you shouldn't be whining. I'm not whining, you're whining. Let's go. Okay. - So excited to eat cake. - You already had a cupcake. I want 10 slices. Whoa, mom. You did such an awesome job, this is so cool. - You like it? - I love it. - Thanks, mom. - Aww. You're welcome. - I helped. - Thanks, Lily. Can I help with anything? No, just go get dressed, honey. Okay, mom. Your dress is on the bed. I know how much you love it. I'm calling dad. He promised me a new one. Yes, I know. Of course I did. Hold on a second. It's my kid. Yeah. Payton, what's up? Dad, you promised me you'd take me to get a new dress. Payton, Payton, Payton, calm down. I got a surprise for you when I get home. You always have to go. Yes I do. Dad? Oh, no. Not today. Where is he? He should be here soon, Pay. Don't count on it. Don't worry, hun. He said it's not going to be like last year. All right, bro. Later, man. What's up, Pay? Payton. Pay, what's wrong? You okay? Okay... What's her problem? She doesn't think your dad's going to make it. Come on, he'll be here. I know he will. Go tell her that. She really needs to get ready. Her friends will be here soon. All right. I'll go talk to her. Stop it! Leave me alone, Mike. Come on. You gotta get ready for your party. I am ready. You're going to wear this to your own party? What's wrong with it? I just, I don't know. I thought you could do better. I'm not wearing that ugly dress. I told mom five times. Okay, what do you want to wear? This doofus. Why can't I wear this? I mean you can, but, you kind of look like a foot. Ugh. I'm going inside. Yeah, while you're at it, why don't you go brush your teeth with some poppy seeds and broccoli, huh? You stink. What do you think you're doing? Going to go get ready. Do you need help? No. Lily, where are you? Hiding! Oh, Mike's going to come and find you. Hello? Is anyone there? Oh, man, this is not cool. Hey. So I talked to dad earlier and he said that if he wasn't back in time for you to go ahead and give Payton her gift. What is it, mommy? I don't really know what he's talking about. He said it's in the closet. Not there! What am I even looking for? I can ask him. Check my closet. Hm. What is it? Why are you yelling? What's wrong? What is it? I can't believe it. Wow. That's really nice. Did he pick that out by himself? Actually, no. We went to Manhattan a few months ago. I remember I saw this dress in the window. I stopped to admire it and my breath fogged up all the windows. I remember telling him how pretty it looked. That's so nice of him. You like it, Mike? I love it. And now you won't smell like a foot. Good one. Oh. Well, I should call him to say sorry. For what? I said some pretty mean things to him earlier. Oh. Go get dressed. Go put it on. Okay. Come on. Man... She is never going to understand this. Oh, I'm going to be in the doghouse so much with my little baby. Oh, come on, man. Don't do that. No, no, no, no, no. Don't roam on me. Roaming, roaming. Roaming. Pay, come get the door. Your friends are here. Happy birthday! Come in. Yay! Hi guys. Son of a... Hello! Hey guys, come on in. Come, this way. Come on, we're playing tag. - You're it. - Thank you guys. See you later. I can take it. Thank you. Okay. Lesson in cool. Gotta be cool. Gotta be really cool. When you were a little boy, all the lights went out in New York, remember? All those people stuck in elevators. That was such a mess. Oh, man, I do not like this. Oh man. - Time out! - That's it, that's it. Hello? May I speak to Roman? No, sorry. I left the office early. Oh, um, good. You know, it's Payton's birthday and the kids are already here. He was supposed to pick up pizza. I would imagine he'd be home any minute, though. He was just finishing up the reports. Okay. Thank you. Mike. Come here for a second. What's up? I can't find your father. What do you mean you can't find him? I tried calling him. He's not answering. Well that doesn't surprise me. I talked to his secretary, and I did the math. He was supposed to be here hours ago. Well did you check traffic? No, you didn't. Traffic is backed up. See? I don't know what to do. Did you call his garage? I don't know. I have no idea where he parks his car. You can Google it. Okay. Mr. Tech. I'll call 'em. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. I'll watch the kids. Kids, no climbing the tree. Turn on the lights! I'm stuck! No, it's my dad's car. Uh, the license plate, um... Do you know dad's license plate number? Mm... One second. Okay. It is DMA... 1924. Yeah, black, correct. Oh. He's checking. Yes. Um... Okay. Thank you. You, too. It's not his. Try another? Yeah. - Please Mike. - We can keep tryin' 'em. I'm going to go take care of the kids. Okay. Hi. Yeah, um, I'm looking for my dad's vehicle. It is a black Discovery. License plate number DMA1924. Oh, man. Oh man. Oh no. Oh no. Hello, this is James. Hi, yeah. My name is Michael Juniper. I'm looking for my father's vehicle. I'm sorry. I can't give out that information. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. My dad's missing, okay? He was supposed to be home hours ago for my sister's birthday and he still hasn't showed up. Okay. What's his plate number? The plate number. It's um... It's, I have it somewhere. Hold on, hold on. Hey, kid. Did you eat lunch today? What does that have to do with anything? Some guy gave me a bag of lunch and it had a birthday card in it. Yes. That is his car. I forgot my lunch in my dad's car this morning. That's this car, right? I honestly can't give you that information. It's a black Discovery, okay? Is it his car or not? Yes, it's here. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. And... Can you just tell him that his family is worried about him if you see him? I can do that. No problem. Excuse me, sir. What happened over here? We've got a single car traffic collision. Who was it? Anybody injured? I can't tell you his name. Do you know if it was Roman? I can't tell you his name. All right. Thank you. It's gonna a long night. But we gotta do what we gotta do and it's bad enough that we're here and that we s- - Excuse me, officers? What's going on over here? Texting and driving, dude. We see it every day. Was there anybody hurt? We're not authorized to give you that information, sir. We can't help you with that, sir. I need you to stay behind the line, okay? Is it male or female? We can't give you that information. We're in no position to do that, sir. It'd be best for you to just move along, okay? All right. Thanks. This is such a messed up... That does not work! It doesn't. We got to go, mom. Go where? To his office. He's gotta be there. What are we going to do with all the kids? Fine, I'll just go. No way, Mike. You just got your permit. You can't drive without supervision. Besides, it's going to take you two hours to get to Manhattan at this point. Okay? What do you want to do? I don't know. Fine. - I'll call the cops. - Wait. Relax. Let me call. You're going to upset your sisters. She's already upset. Would you please just go get some pizzas? Get four pies. - Some pizzas? - Please. Thank you. 911 operator. Do you need police, fire or ambulance? No, my husband is missing. He was supposed to be home hours ago. He's not answering his phone. Ma'am, this does not seem like an emergency. I'm sorry. We called his parking garage and his car is still there. Maybe he's working late? I truly believe there's something wrong. What's the physical address of this office? It's 121 West 38th Street. Did you call his office? I called the office and everybody left for the day. Could he be running late- - No, ma'am he was supposed to be here hours ago. Are you positive he was coming straight home? Yes, ma'am. It's a bit early to file a police report, but if you don't hear from him by tomorrow, you can call us back. What'd they say? They said it's too early to report a missing person. He's not missing. What don't they get about that? Mom, something is wrong. He called me today and he never does that. He called you? Yeah. I was at track practice and I got a FaceTime from a really strange number. It was him just trying to figure out the app, but I had to go. It doesn't feel right. Oh, man. Okay. Oh, good, thank god. Okay, let's text a little bit here buddy. And... Oh, come on man. Don't do... Return to sender? What? Oh man. Son of a gun. Whew. Oh, man. Guys, my dad's home with the pizza! - Hey. - What's up, man? - How much is it? - $60. 60? All right, you just keep the change. Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thanks, man. Where is he? He's gonna be home soon, Pay- - No! Where is he? - Call him now. - I already called him. - What else do you want? - Mom! Pay, I know. We tried to call him. He didn't answer. Why would he do this to me? Kids, who wants pizza? Me! Me! We tried to call him, Pay. You've just got to realize dad's busy. And his secretary left work early today so he was even busier. Hey, he's going to be here. But for now you should go and enjoy your party. You only turn eight once. - I guess you're right. - Mm-hm. Maybe we can have a family dinner with him on another day. See, that's a great idea. I'll cook for everybody. I just learned how to make ramen in my cooking class. - Can I help? - Can you help? Are you kidding me? You make the best banana pancakes I've ever had. I need your skills. Thanks Mike. I love you. I love you too, kid. Now go before your friends eat all the pizza. There is never enough time in the day. There's so much pressure on me. So much pressure on me and every day. So much pressure and every day I try to make you guys proud. Yep. As I write... Hello? Hello? Hello? Son of a gun. - Daddy! - How is my favorite girl? Go call your mommy for me. Mom! Wait. You guys. You think you can just disappear for a week and show up like nothing has happened? Hello? Hello... Man. Oh. Oh, wow. Ugh. God. No. Oh. It is so important to associate yourself with people who will encourage you. Life is not about competing against each other like in track, but competing against yourself. Who you were yesterday. What is life really about? Life is about money? No. You taught me that life is about family. I've tried to make it home for dinner, but... So by the time I arrive, you've already stopped wondering if I'm gonna make it in time. And the anger begins to set in. What's important... What's important... Is what you make of your life and the happiness, underline happiness, is what you bring. The happiness you bring to it. Absolutely. Hello? Hello? Hi. I'm here for the party. Where's the birthday girl? Oh, uh, hi. Um, she's inside. Do you mind to keep them busy before you start the show? We're waiting for their father to come home. Sure. I'll take 'em outside and I'll show 'em some stuff. Excuse me. Are you hungry? Do you want some pizza? That's okay. I'm good. Oh, thank you so much. Kids, come outside. - Hi. - Hi. Come, Payton. Hi. Hi Payton. I'm Mary. I brought you a special unicorn hoop today. Can I teach you some cool tricks? That would be so cool. Man, come on... My little baby. Now there were times I've gotten alone in the big city, but you were always there for me. I was afraid I wasn't good enough for you, so, I did the only thing I knew how. Oh man. Yay. But I would like to tell you, Nicole, I love you more than life itself. Oh, Nicole. My intention... My intention... My intention was to keep our family safe and happy, always. I am blessed. I am blessed and happy to have all of my family together. To have all of my family together. Please tell Payton, please tell Payton I tried to get there today. Just tell her. Hello? Excuse me, is Michael there? Who is this? He called my garage earlier. Did you find the car? Ma'am, his car is parked here. I can't give you any more information. If you give me his address, I could probably help. What makes you want to help us? He fed me lunch earlier today. Lunch? With a nice birthday card inside. It's my birthday, too. How did you get my number? Michael Juniper gave it to me. What's your name? Ma'am, I spoke with a police officer. There was an accident. A truck crashed into a utility box. Only one man was injured, but they wouldn't tell me what hospital he was in. Did you get any other information? No. Okay, I'm an hour and a half away from the city. I have 20 kids running around the house. Would you please give me your number in case you get any other information? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Mike. Yeah, yeah, what's wrong? The garage just called. There was an accident on your dad's block. Are you serious? We need to call the hospital that's in the vicinity. I'll call 'em, I'll call 'em. Hey. How's it going? Sorry we're late. Hope we didn't miss the festivities... Dhruv, go find Payton. Give her her gift. What's wrong, Nic? What's wrong? Roman hasn't called back. Okay... We've tried everybody, we even tried the cops. Okay, calm down. The man called and said that there was an accident on his block and maybe... Slow down. Maybe he got tired and he took a nap or something in the office. Yeah, I'd like to think that, but... I highly doubt it. Well what can I do? I can stay here if you want. I don't even know. I have 20 kids running around and by the time I get to Manhattan, it's rush hour, so... I'll entertain the heck out of these kids. Don't worry, he's going to be fine. Okay. Mike. I'll meet you at the car, okay? Baby, come on, let's take a ride. Can I bring my dolls? Yes. Uh, Payton, I'll be back. I have to pick up dad at work. Still? Yeah, he had car trouble. Do you want to, you want to come with us or you want to stay with your friends? Well, we already sang happy birthday in school. I think you should come. Ladies and gentlemen, gather around and come see the famous hula hoop toss. Let's go, let's go. Come on, girls. Buckle up. Okay. Take my doll, Payton. I can't. - Got the keys? - Yeah. Mommy, what's happening? It's okay, baby. One second. Are you buckled? I took out a life insurance policy a few months ago for $1 million. Kindly collect the money, pay off the mortgage. There's still 120,000 to pay off. Use the rest to pay for college and art supplies. Get back and in touch with that side of you. I know when you became a mom, man, you gave up a lot. Please forgive me for that. Mom, mom. Mom? Hey. Hey, hey. He's gotta be at this hospital, okay? It's right down the street from his office. Okay, uh... What don't you put the GPS and uh, try to use the app. You know, the new one. It gives you the best directions. Wait a minute. Why isn't dad at work? He, um... Just take a left here, okay? - I'm finding the directions. - Okay. Let's go. Nicole, by the time you find this letter, I'm not sure if I'll still be here. Mike, please stay in the car. Call the parking garage and see if there's any updates. - Got it. - Please watch the kids, okay? My husband is missing. There was an accident. I have a strong reason to believe he was admitted to this hospital. Name? Roman Juniper. When was he admitted? I'm not sure. I'm his wife. Hi, I'm looking for a Roman Juniper. Okay. We have no one by that name here at the moment. Is there any way to check if he was admitted to a different hospital? What type of accident? It was a car crash. Okay. Yes. Can you please track? All right you guys, um, I'm gonna go check on mom, okay? Stay here. - Mike? - What? I'm scared. All right, you guys can come. Come on, let's go. Come on, fast, fast, fast. Juniper? Right here. They brought a man in earlier. He doesn't have identification, but he fits your husband's description. Are there any marks on his body so that we could identify him? Um, yes, he has a birthmark inside his right ankle. Okay. Is he okay? He's in critical condition. When the truck hit, it punctured his right lung. That's not him. I hope not. He always has his wallet om him. He had nothing on him at all? No. Nothing. Well can you find out? I am. I will. It's okay, girls. It's okay. I'm sorry. - Mommy? - It's okay. - Where's daddy? - He's okay, it's not him. Hang out and we'll look for it, okay? Let Mike be in charge of the eBay account. Sell all my baseball cards, except Shoeless Joe Jackson, 'cause that'll be worth tons in a few years. Susan has all the accounts payable and receivable. If you would like to shut down my company... That's up to you. I don't want to burden you with that. I love you. And Mike, I wanted to come to his next competition. And my goodness, that Lily, she is your twin. She's your twin. Oh, that Lily, she's my little left handed genius. Excuse me. Yes? Hi, I was called recently about a missing person and the family's really worried. I'm concerned they might be in this building right here. Just stay calm. If there's someone in there, we'll find 'em. I'm going to talk to the chief. - Okay. - I'll be right back, okay? All right. - Thank you. - Hey chief. This man says he's got a friend stuck in the building. Should I gather up the guys and go inside? Let me notify 'em. Command to all units, be advised, we have a report of a person stuck inside the building. Please initiate procedures. All right. I'm going to gather up the guys and head inside. Okay, give me a report. Will do. Hey, how you doin'? I just talked to the chief. Just remain calm. We're gathering up all the guys and we're headed inside very shortly. Okay, great. Is there anything I can do? Stay calm. We got it under control. Okay. Come on guys, let's go. Let's find this guy. One thing I would like to say to all of you... Never leave your work pending. When then you start something, you must finish it. Nobody's ever half-finished in this family. And... Please, please, please, ma.. You can go see him now. Mike, stay here and watch the kids, okay? Come here. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. The lights are back on. Thank god. It's hot as hell in here. Sam, go get the paramedics. Okay, Charlie. I'm on it. It's not him. It's not? No. Let's go. Oh! - Thank god. - Let's go. Let's go. Come on, let's go. Sir, can you open your eyes for me? I have a pulse. All right, that was a tough one. Mike, stay in the car. Watch the kids. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Ma'am, you can't park there. - Okay, you watch me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down. Calm down. Don't you tell me to calm down. My husband, Roman, where is he? - Did you say Roman? - Roman Juniper. Okay, he was stuck in the elevator a few hours. He's unconscious. He's on his way to the hospital. On his way to Central Hospital. - Which- - Central Hospital in the middle of town. - These are his belongings. - Are you okay, ma'am? Here are his belongings. Is my daddy all right? He's gonna be find, sweetheart. - Why do you have his stuff? - You need to take this. It's what was left in the elevator. What is this? You need to head to the hospital. Let's go, Mike. Come on, guys. We have to be strong for your daddy. Come on. Come on. Give me the key. I'll drive, I'm driving. Come on, girls. Mike, open the door. Let's go. Come on, Payton, come on. Mrs. Juniper, you're back. Yes, my husband, Roman, was brought in. He was stuck on the elevator. Roman Juniper? Let me check. Um, he's in ICU on the sixth floor. The elevator's just back there. Thanks. Let's go, guys. Come on, girls. Hi, excuse me. My husband Roman Juniper was admitted here. What's going on? He's still unconscious. We're doing our best. He's suffering from idiopathic ventricular fibrillation from the shock, but don't worry. He's getting the absolute best treatment. I will let you know as soon as there is any update. There is never enough time in the day. So much pressure on me and every day and the anger begins to set in. I took out a life insurance policy a few months ago for one... It is so important to associate yourself with people who will encourage you. You taught me that life is about family. I would like to tell you, Nicole, I love you more than life itself. My intention was to keep our family safe and happy. I am blessed. I am blessed. Please tell Payton I tried to get there. Nicole, I know when you became a mom, man, you have up a lot. Please forgive me for that. By the time you find this letter, I'm not sure if I'll still be here. What's wrong, momma? It's okay. Your dad loved us very much. He loves us and he gives us the best he can, okay? - Don't cry, momma. - I'm okay. Dad's gonna be okay. I promise. I know he'll be okay. Mike. Could you please go get us some snacks or... I'm really not hungry. Mike, please. I don't know, get them, like muffins or... - I'm kind of hungry. - Thank you, Mike. Yup. Come on, girls. Come on. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. Start the levophed drip. It's not working. We're going to lose him. Go get his wife. He's not going to survive. Okay. Just you. What's happening? What's going on? I'm sorry. We couldn't save him. Ms. Juniper. Ms. Juniper. Wake up. Mrs. Juniper. Wake up. Wake up. - You're their only mom. - Mom. Mom. Mom. Mommy, wake up. I brought you this muffin. Thank you, Lily. Oh my god, come here. Oh thank god. His blood pressure is dropping dramatically. We can't lose him. We need a levophed drip now. - Here, quick. - Okay. His blood pressure's dropping again. If you pray, please pray for him. - No. - No. Mom. Lily. Come here. You can see him now, but he's not doing well. I love you. I need you. I don't care if you come home late or... Everybody's here. I'll wear the old dress. I love the old dress. Dad? I don't know if you can hear me, but I need you to wake up. I'll be whatever you want me to be. I'll be a math teacher. I'll get 100% on every test. I don't need those stupid shoes. I'll come in first every time without it, but I need you to wake up. Mommy, I don't like those straight lines. Make them go away. Mommy, I told you I don't like straight lines. Oh thank god. All right, everyone has to leave the room now. Come on, we have to take care of your dad. Come on. I have an update for you. He's stabilized. You can come see him now, but he's unconscious. Let's go. Daddy? Mommy. - You're back. - Hey baby. Hello, darling. Hey sugarface. How you doin', boy? I'm good, dad. Oh. - How you feelin'? - Ah, I'm okay. I need a Coca Cola. - He's back. - Yeah. Maybe there's some birthday cake left for him. Oh, I want cake. I want cake. Is there by any chance we can get more?
