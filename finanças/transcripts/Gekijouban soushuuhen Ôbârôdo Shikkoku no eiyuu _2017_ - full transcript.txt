I was worried sick. You haven't been back for days. I've been waiting for you. Who are you? You don't know her? I came to kidnap you. Nfirea, step back. I want to borrow your talent of utilizing any magical item to summon an army of undead. Become our tool and use the Crown of Wisdom, okay? I'm begging you. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. No worries. The registration is complete. From now on, your name is Hamsuke. Thank you so much, Master. He talks! Incredible. I heard that the master holds a Copper plate. Is that true? He's riding such a magnificent magical monster. I think he's a famous adventurer. Excuse me. Are you the one who went to gather herbs with my grandson? I'm Lizzie Bareare, Nfirea's grandmother. I'm Momon, an adventurer who escorted him to Carne Village. This is Nabe. Also... I'm the Wise King of the Forest. My name is Hamsuke now. This strong and powerful magical monster is the legendary Wise King of the Forest? Yes. I met him during the quest while I was guarding your grandson, so I kept him. That's amazing. By the way, where's my grandson? He has left with the herbs. We're planning to go to your house to get our pay. I see. Do you want to go together? Yes, that would be my pleasure. Who are you? Ordinary people cannot use the seventh-tier magic spell, Undeath Army, to summon a huge horde of undead. But you can do it when you're wearing the Crown of Wisdom. And even if you can't completely control the undead you summoned, you can still incite them. It's a very perfect plan! Nfirea, leave quickly. But... -Ninya, step back too. -What? You still need to rescue your sister, who has been captured by a nobleman. You guys... How moving! I'm on the verge of tears. But I can't let you get away. You're playing around too much. But you prepared everything to ensure no one could hear their screams, right? It's fine to have at least one of them play with me, right? Momon. Yes, Ms. Albedo. We'll act according to Lord Ainz's instructions. Pretending to be a stupid and capricious rich girl living in this city, I encountered a group of men suspected of being robbers. They are lying in wait in the streets and will try to ambush us. For that reason, I think it will all go according to Lord Ainz's plan. Capturing a large number of humans is trivial for me. There will be more than enough. I hope we can capture those that Lord Ainz wants, humans who can do magic and Martial Arts. In E-Rantel, Lord Ainz captured a strong magical monster called the Wise King of the Forest, and elevated his reputation as an adventurer. What an achievement in a short amount of time. Lord Ainz is amazing. Ms. Shalltear. There is something I've wanted to ask you for a long time. What is it? It seems like you and Aura don't have a good relationship. Is there any particular reason? It's not that we don't have a good relationship. It's because my creator, Lord Peroroncino, programmed it that way. That's why I would prank her at times. After all, Lord Peroroncino and that Shorty's creator, Lord Bukubukuchagama, are siblings. Is that so? The Supreme Beings spoke of it once. What's the matter, Peroroncino? My sister voiced a character in the adult game I just bought. Bukubukuchagama? She is a popular voice actor. It was a long-awaited masterpiece too. It's unsettling since she's your sister, right? I heard that a voice actor is a job that uses sound to provide soul. That means it's an occupation that creates life. Thank you for that information, Ms. Shalltear. It's a great honor to hear anecdotes about Supreme Beings. Speaking of which, for this quest, how do you plan to capture the humans, Ms. Shalltear? Lord Ainz said that we can even suck up their blood and turn them into slaves. But we must definitely bring them back. In that case, Mr. Demiurge would be the best candidate for this quest. His skill, Command Mantra, is as powerful as Ms. Aura's Sigh. It can control the opponent's consciousness. Sebas. Say that again. Coming from the race of Dragonoid, are you going to battle with me in this form? That's not what I meant. I just feel a bit uneasy. I hope you won't activate your passive skill, Blood Frenzy, Ms. Shalltear. I'll suppress Blood Frenzy. That's right. I want to complete the quest that Lord Ainz gave me, so that he'd say, "Shalltear, well done. You're my most important slave." I talked too much. I didn't realize that it was disrespectful to Lord Ainz who chose you. Please forgive me. It seems the carriage has stopped. Yes. Nfirea. Momon is here. What's going on? Something happened. What's the matter? What's this room for? It's a storage for herbs. What happened? Where's Nfirea? He's not here. Nfirea! Protect her. Yes, sir. Ninya. There seem to be no traps. However... I heard that fights arise whenever there's a woman in a team. Is that so? That makes me feel... a bit unhappy. A piercing weapon? My grandson, Nfirea, is not here. His stuff seems untouched. It seems the goal of the attacker is to take Nfirea away. Who are these men? They were adventurers who accepted your grandson's quest with me. They were your companions? No, we just worked on the quest together. By the way, what do you think of this? About what? Create Undead. It is at least a third-tier spell. If someone can perform that spell, they can hide the bodies or take them along to buy more time. But this is what they did instead. That means they didn't care if we found out about the kidnapping, or they were confident they could get away even if they left some evidence. Regardless, we need to deal with this quickly. Do you want to hire me? This is a quest for adventurers. You're very lucky, Lizzie Bareare. Standing in front of you is this city's best adventurer. At the same time, the only adventurer who can bring your grandson back. If you hire me, I might be able to accept the offer. Indeed. If it was you... I'll do it. I'll hire you! Is that so? But our price won't be cheap. Are you ready for the price? How much do you want? Everything. What? I want you to give your everything to me. I'll start looking for Nfirea then. It's easy this time. Their plates are gone. They didn't take any valuables. Just the plates. I think they have taken those as trophies for their hunt. To them, they are souvenirs, but that's a fatal mistake. This is the locator scroll. I don't need to tell you who the target is, right? Yes, sir. You have to consider that they may use Detector Locator, Fake Cover, or Counter Detect to protect themselves. Those are fundamental skills. This should be enough for our enemy this time. All right, Narberal. Begin. Fake Cover. Counter Detect. When using magic to collect information, we must take precautionary measures. When battling someone, collect all the information you can get and beat him hard. This is the basic technique that Punitto Moe came up with that can be used by anyone in battles. Locate Object. Here. If I'm not mistaken, that should be a cemetery. Next, use Clairvoyance and Crystal Monitor so that I can see it too. Clairvoyance. Crystal Monitor. A large army of undead. I'm sure now. Those guys with the plates are also around that area. Even so, there's not enough time to collect more information. We're done. What did you find out? The enemy is lying in wait at the cemetery. Is my grandson there too? Yes, and an army of undead is around him. You don't need to be so surprised. The army of undead might also leave the cemetery. Please inform the Adventurer's Guild and the people about this. Nabe and I will go to the cemetery now. Do you have a way to defeat the army of undead? Don't I already have it here? A large army of undead! And not just 100 or 200 of them. There are at least 1,000 of them. Inform the guard station. Until reinforcements arrive, we must hold on. What? Damn it! Retreat. Retreat! Adventurers? But a Copper-ranked adventurer can't help us. Go and leave this place now... Nabe, give me the sword. Look behind you. Who are you? Open the door. Don't be silly! A large army of undead is at the door. So what? What does that have to do with me? Never mind. If you don't want to open the door, then I have no choice. Ms. Nabe, please don't leave me! I want to be by Master's side too. Create Mid-Tier Undead. Jack the Ripper. Corpse Collector. Go! Incredible. Let's go then. Master! Please don't leave me all alone here. Khajiit, someone is coming. Okay. I found the fool. Hello. This is a beautiful night, isn't it, Khajiit? Isn't it a waste to use it for some lame ritual? I will decide if the night is suitable for a ritual or not. By the way, who are you? I'm a hired adventurer looking for a young man. I don't need to tell you his name. You should know who it is. Also, one of you used a piercing weapon. Trying to lay low? Did that person go into hiding because they were afraid of us? You examined the bodies. You're quite good. You... Oh, my. He saw through me. There's no point in hiding. Now then, can I ask your names? My name is Clementine. Nice to meet you. It's no use even if you know, but my name is Momon. Indeed. But how did you find us? The answer lies under your cape. Let me see it. What a pervert! You're sick! Just kidding. You mean these? That's right. Those gave away your location. -Nabe. -Yes. I'll let you handle Khajiit and those men. I'll deal with this woman. Yes, sir. Beware of the sky. Yes. Clementine. Let's have a deadly battle over there. This woman? Twin Maximize Magic. What? Electrosphere. What a fool. Good grief. It would have been so nice if he had died like a caterpillar. That's right. Were those people I killed in that shop your companions? Are you mad because your companions are dead? It was so funny. That magic caster believed that someone would come and rescue them until the end. I'm sorry, I killed them all. You don't need to apologize. Is that so? What a shame. "How dare you kill my companions?" I get the best feeling when someone yells that at me. Why aren't you mad? It's really boring this way. Aren't you companions? Sometimes, I would do the things that you did too. So it would be too capricious of me to blame you. However, they are tools for me to elevate my reputation. You've ruined my plans and that makes me very unhappy. By the way, that pretty girl is also a magic caster, right? She won't be able to win against Khajiit then. But it's not like you can win against me anyway. Even if it was Nabe here, she could easily defeat you. How silly. You're just a magic caster. I can finish you in one shot. That has always been the case. I see. In this country, the only ones who can fight me on equal terms are that one person from Blue Roses and that one person from Red Drop. Then there's Gazef Stronoff and maybe Brain Unglaus. Very useful information. I'll give you a handicap then. That would be my revenge against you. Even if I don't know how ugly you look under that helmet, but how can I, Clementine, who have surpassed humans and reached the realm of heroes, possibly lose? That's why I'm giving you a handicap. I won't even use my full strength. You're so stupid even if you can use third-tier magic spells. Stupid? You're a mere worm. How dare you say that. What's wrong with calling an imbecile who came to ruin my plans stupid? And you can't understand the difference in our powers. You're seeking your own death. Let me show you the power of my supreme pearl! Beware of the sky. Skeletal Dragon, which has absolute resistance to magic, is known to be the natural enemy of magic casters. Then, I will beat it to death. What? Who exactly are you? Are you a Mithril... No, are you an Orichalcum-ranked adventurer? You're so excited about such a minor thing. That's why you're a lowly creature. You tiny beetle. Damn you. I won't let you... Ray of Negative Energy! Reinforce Armor. Lesser Strength. Shield Wall. Undead Flame. Reinforce Armor. Shield Wall. Protection Energy Negative. Acid Javelin! Defense magic? How troublesome. Lightning. You're the troublesome one, bagworm moth. Don't hide in the back. Come in front. I have no other choice. Orb of Death! I'll show you the real power of the Orb of Death! Another one. I've used up all the negative energy. But after I kill all of you and turn this city into a ghost town, I'm sure it will recover. I'm a bit tired now. Indeed, your physical condition is very good. No wonder you're so proud of yourself. However, are you stupid? You're just waving around your sword with your impressive physical capability. Are you belittling me? Attack me then. Since we started, you just kept evading me, right? I'd do it if I could. Where did your confidence when you said no one could defeat you go? Skeletal Dragons? That's right. You even know about them. Magic has no effect on them, so it's the worst enemy for magic casters. I see. Is that why you said Nabe wouldn't win? That's right. So, do you have a way to close the distance between us? Sure. Invulnerable Fortress. A Martial Arts technique? It's so hard. Never mind. I'll just attack where your armor is thinner next time. I originally wanted to weaken you slowly and bully you when you can't move anymore. What a shame. Did you purposely aim at my shoulder? I've learned something from you. I'll go ahead then. Invulnerable Fortress. Flow Acceleration. Don't give me a handicap. If you don't use your true ability, you might die. Good grief. This battle has taught me a lot of things. The existence of Martial Arts techniques and the importance of maintaining balance when making a move. You're only realizing that now? You don't deserve to be called a warrior. But why didn't that move hurt you? Did you use a defensive technique? Well, I do have a lot that I don't know of. I must really thank you. But I don't have time now. Let's end this game now. Narberal Gamma! I command you to show them the power of Nazarick! What does that mean? Now then, prepare to die as you come at me! If you surrender, I might be able to let you go. You're a mere human. What? How dare you talk big, you scum. Destroy her, Skeletal Dragons! Narberal Gamma! I command you to show them the power of Nazarick! Yes, sir. I won't be battling you as Nabe anymore. Instead, I'll do it as Narberal Gamma. Teleportation. Fly. She's gone. Where did she go? She can even use Fly. But how did she evade that attack? Also, she can use Fly, but she didn't plan on running away from the Skeletal Dragons. Could it be that she has a way to deal with their absolute resistance to magic? I know every way of winning this battle. Before that... Rejoice. A mere human like you had the chance to battle Narberal Gamma, who belongs to Pleiades, a combat maid squad that serves the Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick, the Supreme One, Ainz Ooal Gown. Skeletal Dragons! What? Does it hurt that much? A teleportation spell. Your trump card is to kill me with a teleportation spell? How can that be? I just made a demonstration that it's also easy to kill you this way. Are you crazy? Even if you're just a tick, what kind of response is that? Use more of your brain. You... It's time to end this. It would be rude to make Lord Ainz wait too long. You seem to think that magic has no effect on Skeletal Dragons. I'll give you a chance to learn then, water strider. The price you pay is your life. What kind of magic is that? But Skeletal Dragons have absolute resistance to magic. Absolute resistance to magic? To be precise, they're capable of making sixth-tier magic spells and below ineffective. That means it's not immune to the higher-tier magic spells that I, Narberal Gamma, cast. How is that possible? No human in this world can cast a seventh-tier magic spell. Thank you for being Lord Ainz's stepping stone. Twin Maximize Magic, Chain Dragon Lightning. Even worms give off a nice aroma when they are grilled. Should I bring him back to Entoma as a gift? What are you doing? Have you given up? Since I've already given a command to Narberal, I think I should finish up here too. Are you serious, you jerk? You don't even know Martial Arts. Do you think you can defeat me, the mighty Clementine? How infuriating! It's really amazing for a weakling to make such a joke. But I do agree that we should end this now. Pace of the Wind. Greater Evasion. Ability Boost. Greater Ability Boost. He's not doing anything? Die! I'm not done yet! I see. YGGDRASIL doesn't have this kind of weapon. I learned something new again. No way! How is this possible? Why aren't you dead yet? Let me tell you the answer. Undead? An Elder Lich? You're very close. How does it feel to battle with a magic caster using a sword? Don't belittle me! Why? This is the reason why I gave you a handicap. To put it simply, I don't need to use my true ability to deal with someone like you. You're someone I don't need to use magic to deal with. Damn it! Since you already know the answer... This is in the way. Damn you! Are you kidding me? I'm going to start then. Could it be... Could it be that you... If you're even weaker, I want to use this to finish you. But there's not much difference if you die from a sword, or from being crushed to death, or from having broken bones, right? You'll die anyway. Damn you! Bastard! Stop struggling so hard. When you were killing them, didn't you take your time? That's why I want to take it slowly too. The dance of death? I forgot to tell you. I'm very capricious. Magic can heal blindness. But it seems that the problem lies on his consciousness being controlled. This must be the reason. All Appraisal Magic Item. The Crown of Wisdom? I see. An item that doesn't exist in YGGDRASIL. I want to take it back to Nazarick, but since I've been hired for this quest, Ainz Ooal Gown's name would be ruined if I intentionally fail it. Crumble away! Greater Break Item. Lord Ainz. I'll be very loyal to you, Master. All right. By the way, let's return in triumph. Master, please don't ignore my loyal oath! Message. Lord Ainz. Albedo? Shalltear Bloodfallen has rebelled. Looks like you're having fun. My name is Brain Unglaus. Let me enjoy this. I'm a cold, heartless, and pitifully cute monster. However, this nail cutter is really dull. I'm so silly. Are we going to play tag? It's about time we finish up. I remember that, but... Are we going to play hide-and-seek next? Is that an escape route? -Capture them! They are vampires! -But I really want to kill them. -Prepare silver weapons. -I want to tear them apart. I want to tear them to pieces and bathe in their blood! Treat them as dessert! Capture that woman without harming her! Look into my eyes. Where did you get this potion? From an inn in E-Rantel. A man wearing black armor gave it to me. That woman received instructions from him too? No, is it to strengthen our good relationship? What is your motive in coming here? My companions and I were searching for the headquarters of mercenaries who became robbers. The situation didn't seem right, so we split up. Split up? Yes. In case of an emergency, a ranger was on stand-by behind us. He should be on the way to E-Rantel now. Damn it. Children! Eat every human in the forest. Two humans escaped! Lord Ainz will scold me. They were defeated? You're in the way! Lord Kralgra! I didn't expect we'd come to a point when we need to use magical equipment. Where are you going? Call Yuri. I want to go to the Treasury. Is this your first time in the Treasury too, Albedo? Yes. You're the only one who can bring me here. I can't enter otherwise. That's true. Ainz Ooal Gown's glory is forever! If I'm not mistaken... "With great sagacity, it doth ascend gently from Earth to Heaven. Again it doth descend to Earth, and uniteth in itself the force from things superior and things inferior." Did I get it right? The Mausoleum up ahead is our destination. Mausoleum? You don't know of it? What about Pandora's Actor? As the Overseer, I know his name, but I've never met him. Pandora's Actor. The Area Guardian of the Treasury. He has the same power and wisdom as Demiurge and I do. You were the one who created him. I guess so. I think he's the one responsible for Nazarick's Treasury. Lord Tabula Smaragdina? How come? No, no way. Who are you? Even if you imitate the outer form of a Supreme Being, I would never mistake the one who created me. Is that so? Kill him. But... That's enough, Pandora's Actor. Welcome. Thank you for coming. My creator, Lord Momonga. You're quite energetic. Yes, I've always guarded my post with a lot of energy. By the way, why did you come this time? I came to retrieve some World Items. World Items can change the world! Extremely powerful! The proof of supremacy. Will countless treasures hidden deep inside Nazarick's Treasury finally be put to good use? How lame. That's right. I'm taking Avarice and Generosity, Ginnungagap, Billion Blades, and Depiction of Nature and Society. Yes, Lord Momonga. Also, call me Ainz from now on. Ainz Ooal Gown. Yes, sir. My creator, Lord Ainz. Stop that. Don't look at my dark history with such cold eyes. Right. I set his costume and behavior because I thought it was cool. No, I still think that this military uniform is cool. What's the matter? -Let's go. -Yes. Take care, Lord Ainz, and the two ladies. Ladies? Hey, come over here. I'm your creator, right? You're completely right, Lord Ainz. Then, I don't care if you treat this as a command or a request, but stop saluting, okay? Well, how do I describe it? Doesn't it feel strange? You look very powerful wearing a military uniform. You really don't need to salute. If that's what the god wants. That's German, right? Don't speak like that in front of me too. Yes. I'm begging you. I never thought that I would force myself to calm down under such circumstances. It's even more embarrassing than riding a giant hamster. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Albedo? Yes? Give Yuri the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown that I gave you for safekeeping. You can only get into the Treasury by teleporting while wearing the ring, but if you wear that ring when you come into this room, you'll be attacked by giant Stone Golems. That's why you had to take it off. Were these giant Stone Golems made based on the Supreme Beings? I'm surprised you noticed that. I made them based on the looks of my past companions. They look ugly, right? Not at all. However, with the Mausoleum and these statues, does it mean that the other Supreme Beings have already passed away? That's not really an accurate statement. No, maybe that is right. Everyone left after giving me the items and equipment. That's about it. Even if I can sell them, I won't do that, Peroroncino. You're welcome to come back any time. Even so, I still want to believe that everyone is in some corner of the world. What's the matter? It's nothing. Look. There's a space over there. My statue would be placed there in the future. Please don't say that. Please don't! Lord Ainz. You must stay until the end, kind sir, Lord Ainz. Please always be our master. I'm sincerely begging you. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. Forgive me. Lord Ainz. Please promise me. Promise me that you won't abandon us and leave this place. I'm sorry, but... Why? Why won't you promise me? Is there anything that displeases you? If you tell me, I'll immediately handle it for you. If you think that I'm bothering you, I'll immediately commit suicide. No! Listen to me. The effect of the World Item that controlled Shalltear's consciousness is absolute. We also need to have World Items as preventive measures. Is that why you came to retrieve the World Items? That's right. But I want the guardians to have them. Actually, I know a way to save Shalltear. And that's... Among the World Items, there are 20 unrivaled items known as Twenty. One of them is here. But since the Twenty are too powerful, they will disappear after they are used once. After learning that World Items exist in this world and that our enemy seems to have them, I'm conflicted whether to use this trump card now or not. I'm such a lousy master. Not at all. The Supreme Beings made great efforts to collect the World Items. I think they're even more valuable than us. Albedo. I'm going to tell you why I didn't agree to your request just now. I'm planning to have a duel with Shalltear. I'm not sure I'll come back alive if I do. Please wait for a moment. I know that the battle with Shalltear is unavoidable. It will be bad if we ignore her too. Why not stop her with numbers then? Why should you fight her alone? No, Albedo. I just... I thought about that. There are three reasons. The first reason. I have doubts whether I'm qualified to be your master or not. Thinking about it calmly, if an YGGDRASIL player exists in this world, I should have considered the possibility that he would possess World Items. I'm such a careless person. Am I really qualified to be a ruler? You're qualified just for being here. And you have us to assist you. The second reason. This might be a trap. A trap? They have Shalltear as bait and others might be lying in wait around her. Under such circumstances, if only a few people went there, our opponent might also wonder if we have others lying in wait. The last reason. Because I want to kill Shalltear. Then... Then please let me go. Let me kill Shalltear. Are you confident that you'll win? Shalltear is very powerful. That is precisely the reason why I must go. I'm the only one who can win against Shalltear in Nazarick. Well... Indeed, you might be able to win with your equipment. "Shalltear herself is a form of combat enhancement. And she's a spiritual magic caster who can stop the undead. She's even good in hand-to-hand combat." That means I'm at a disadvantage. Are those the things that you want to say? I'm afraid, yes. Your thoughts are very accurate, but they're also wrong. You only have knowledge that has been input as data in you. What do you mean? You call me the Overlord of Nazarick. I'll show you that you don't call me that for no reason. Aura, Mare. I'm going to split up with you here. Scout the areas nearby. -Yes. -Yes. If the enemy has more men than you, retreat to Nazarick immediately. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Listen to me clearly. You must retreat. That's also part of my plan. The Depiction of Nature and Society and Avarice and Generosity are treasured World Items of Nazarick. They can't be snatched away. Depending on the situation, they could be more important than your lives. -Yes. -Yes. However, even if I've already used magic to confirm it, the World Item holder who's controlling Shalltear's consciousness is not here. What exactly is going on? I'm back. So, why did you let Lord Ainz go alone? It was Lord Ainz's decision. As his lieges, we have to-- Why did you agree? Lord Ainz intentionally lied. Even if you can't fathom the deep thoughts of the Supreme One, you must have realized that. Yes, you're right. Why did you still let Lord Ainz go then? When Lord Ainz went to E-Rantel without any guards with him, you were so against it. Why did you agree this time? Because Lord Ainz himself said that he would defeat Shalltear. I promise, I will surely defeat Shalltear and come back here. His words contained a firm will. As a woman, even if this is a bit disrespectful... After seeing someone you love so determined to do something, you couldn't stop him. And Lord Ainz promised me that he'd surely come back here. You made your judgment using your emotions, not reason. Lord Ainz is the only Supreme Being we have here. If anything threatens his safety, it's our duty to remove it. Even if we get scolded or executed after doing it, we should still take action. Where are you going? Do you still need to ask? I'm going to tell my men to-- I see. You called me and gave strict instructions for me to come here first because of this, Albedo? That's right. How stupid. If Lord Ainz dies because of this, how do you plan to take responsibility? Lord Ainz is the last Supreme Being whom we pledged loyalty to. Lord Ainz will be back. Who can guarantee that? Trust your master. This is also the duty of a created being. So, Cocytus, what are the odds of Lord Ainz winning the battle? The odds are 30 against 70 percent, with 30 percent being in Lord Ainz's favor. Is that so? Let us see then. Lord Ainz will surely turn the tables and win. I'm so stupid. I knew that there's a better way. I fooled Aura and Mare, but Albedo surely noticed that I lied big time. Speaking of which, don't you think that this is a gamble, Shalltear? I'm not sure if I can resurrect like we can in YGGDRASIL, but I've come here for a fight to the death. However... Let me kill Shalltear. I don't want to see you kill each other. And... I, Ainz Ooal Gown, am betting on my name that I definitely won't lose. Body of Effulgent Beryl. I see. If I don't take hostile action against my opponent, I won't get into battle mode just like in the game. Then, Shalltear, I'm sorry but before we start, wait there for a while. Fly. Bless of Magic Caster. Infinity Wall. Magic Ward, Holy. Life Essence. Greater Full Potential. Freedom. False Data, Life. See Through. Paranormal Intuition. Greater Resistance. Mantle of Chaos. Indomitability. Sensor Booster. Greater Luck. Magic Booster. Draconic Power. Greater Hardening. Heavenly Aura. Absorption. Penetrate Up. Greater Magic Shield. Mana Essence. Triplet Maximize Magic, Explosive Land Mine. Triplet Magic, Greater Magic Shield. Triplet Maximize Boost Magic, Magic Arrow. All right, I'll start. What's that? It should be a super-tier spell. That's higher than the tenth-tier. Is there no one lying in wait? Or are they still scouting? Now is a good chance to attack. My gosh, what exactly is going on? Momonga. You need to set the time. Bukubukuchagama. Why can't this watch be switched to silent mode? Please lend me your powers, everyone. Let's start then. Super-tier Magic. Fallen Down! Lord Ainz. That hurts a lot. It's just a small present. Do you like that, Shalltear? It's great. I can't believe that I must kill the powerful Lord Ainz. Hey. Why do you still call me that? What are you saying? You're a Supreme Being. Isn't it natural to address you as Lord Ainz? Who's your master now? My master... Why am I battling Lord Ainz? No, that's not right. Is it because I was attacked? I'm doing my best to eliminate him because I was attacked? Why? Even if I don't understand it, since you attacked me, I need to eliminate you, Lord Ainz. Is that so? I understand. I understand your current condition now. Oh, my. Lord Ainz, what's the matter? Can you win against me in such a condition? It's impossible for Ainz Ooal Gown to lose. Shalltear. You will kneel before me. That's terrifying! Watch out. I'm sorry, Shalltear. I set a Triplet Maximize Magic, Explosive Land Mine over there. Maximize Magic, Gravity Maelstrom! Wall of Stone! Maximize Magic, Hold of Ribs! Shalltear, I forgot to tell you. I've set traps all over this area. How about flying over here? Lord Ainz, you can't provoke me. There are traps in the air too, right? You saw through me? Yes, I did. How is that possible? I just set up that land mine magic. I can't waste my MP on ineffective magic. Before I use up my MP, how much damage can I deal to her? He's Lord Ainz indeed. Attacks can't shorten the distance at all, but Lord Ainz is a magic caster. He needs to rely on MP. As long as I use up his MP, he won't stand a chance against me as I can fight on HP alone. My Spuit Lance can recover my HP, proportionate to the damage I inflict on my enemy. That's why Lord Ainz, who's supposed to fight behind an army, can't summon frontlines. He knows that weak monsters will only help the Spuit Lance recover my HP. You're so pitiful, Lord Ainz. You had to fight me all by yourself. However... Mana Essence. His MP is really high. How did he get such power? Even so, Lord Ainz, who specializes in necromancer magic, is not considered a strong opponent of mine. I'm a bit concerned that he's not wearing his usual magical artifacts, but dragging this on isn't the way to go. I'll prepare for a long battle first. I'll use recovery magic. Regenerate. I won't give you time to regenerate! Maximize Magic, Gravity Maelstrom! Greater Teleportation! Delay Teleportation? Drifting Master Mine! How naive! Maximize Magic, Astral Smite! Maximize Magic, Thousand Bone Lance! Greater Teleportation! I won't let you run! Impure Shockwave Shield! What? Lord Ainz. Did you know that I have this special skill? I've never seen it. How long are you going to force yourself, Lord Ainz? This is Purifying Javelin. Are you going to summon it with your skills? As expected of a holy element attack against a magic caster. It seems very effective! Don't belittle me! Maximize Magic, Reality Slash! That's not regular recovery magic. What did you do? Please don't be so surprised, Lord Ainz. That's a skill too. Please don't think that I'm being unfair. Lord Peroroncino gave me these powers, after all. This proves that he is more talented than you, Lord Ainz. That sounds sincere. Go ahead, Shalltear. No matter what kind of skill you have, you can't defeat my magic! Do you want to have a go at it, Lord Ainz? I won't lose. There's actually a limit to the number of times it can be used. Maximize Magic, Reality Slash! Purifying Javelin! Lord Ainz, you must have used quite a lot of MP. I have used up my skills, but I still have my MP. What about this then? Maximize Magic, Vermillion Nova! Triplet Maximize Magic, Call Greater Thunder! Fire-based attacks don't have an effect? Lord Ainz. It seems like you're prepared for fire-based attacks. It's fundamental to make up for one's weaknesses. However, you can't completely resist all kinds of attacks. I'll aim at your most fatal weakness then. Maximize Magic, Brilliant Radiance! Maximize Magic, True Dark! That's your weakness, Lord Ainz! Cocytus, what's going on? As an undead, divine magic is naturally fatal to Lord Ainz. Even if some equipment can improve his resistance to fire-based attacks, he can't completely eliminate his weakness. I've used divine magic consecutively many times, but Lord Ainz is still at an advantage in terms of magic in this battle. However, he must have used up quite a lot of MP. Body of Effulgent Beryl. Is that defense magic? But that's the right decision. Because I'm going to start directly attacking you now. What a disadvantageous battle. Lord Ainz? Shouldn't you just retreat then? That's true. I... You're right. I'm very capricious, Shalltear. I don't want to run away. Maybe no one would understand me, but I have a sense of fulfillment of being a guild master at this moment. Why? Even if I'm the guild master, I basically just perform miscellaneous tasks and coordination work. Now, I'm fighting in the front line for the guild. Maybe it's just self-satisfaction. Is this what they call a man's pride? Perhaps. All right. We got interrupted by my boring topic. Let's get back to the battle. Summon Household. Sharks Cyclone. Activate Body of Effulgent Beryl! Wall of Skeleton! Maximize Magic, Force Explosion! Release Greater Magic Seal! Magic Destruction! Fly! Have you recovered? Triplet Maximize Magic, Reality Slash! Impure Shockwave Shield! Is it coming? Is it finally coming? Shalltear's trump card. Einherjar! Summon Household. These numbers are a bit of a problem. I'll use range magic to finish all of them. But what about Einherjar... That's unfair! Even if friendly fire is allowed, no one would normally use their own summoned household to heal. Skill. The Goal of All Life is Death. Widen Magic, Cry of the Banshee! That's it. You are amazing, Lord Ainz. None of my children survived. Luckily, Lord Peroroncino gave me resurrection equipment, so I survived. But your MP should be empty, and my HP is still full. That's right. Amazing. In order to trick you into using up your MP, Lord Ainz, I also used up mine. I've basically used up the times I can use my special skills too. I must say that this is a spectacular battle. I'll accept your compliment. Any last words then? Let me think. Since I'm at a disadvantage, I'm basically useless without MP and you didn't preserve your strength with that thought in mind. I want to thank you, Shalltear. If you had battled me more carefully, my plan wouldn't have worked so well. In PVP, what's important in a battle between players is to let your opponent believe false information. For example, I let divine magic that doesn't have much effect on me look very effective through a change of equipment. On the contrary, my weakness is still fire-based magic, but I pretended it didn't have much effect by enduring it with all my might. When my companion, Peroroncino, was creating you, he told me a lot of things. I memorized all your NPC information when you were created. I can say that my familiarity of you is only second to Pandora's Actor. You said you didn't know my special skills. That was a lie, of course. I just thought that you'd take the chance to use up all your skills if I said that. If you use a skill like Impure Shockwave Shield at the end, then the outcome might be unpredictable. Perfect Warrior! From the start, I planned to win using hand-to-hand combat. How is that possible? Isn't that the armor of the Supreme Being... Lord Touch Me? That's right. It's Lord Touch Me's armor. But only someone in the World Champion class can wear it. Perfect Warrior. If you use magic to change to the Warrior class, you can use their weapon without a class penalty. I didn't expect he could use limited equipment of a World Champion. He really thought things through. This sword is... Takemikazuchi Type-8! It was owned by the warrior, Lord Takemikazuchi. I told you, Shalltear. It's impossible for Ainz Ooal Gown to lose. I'll show you. Standing in front of you is Ainz Ooal Gown with the power of 41 Supreme Beings. And you never had a chance of winning since the beginning. Shalltear Bloodfallen. How strong is the man whom you call the Overlord of the Great Tomb of Nazarick and the Ruler of Supreme Beings? Open your eyes wide and see it! There's a loophole! Who says there's a loophole, Shalltear? That's Lord Nishikienrai's... What exactly is going on? That's divine equipment! Get away from me! Take this! I can't believe he made me let out such an embarrassing sound. That's... Yi-Bow! How is this possible? No way! That's Lord Peroroncino's weapon. How did you... No, where did you hide it? Let me tell you. I used a cash item. Could it be that wooden stick? I ran out of MP. I can't defend myself from that without magic. Special skills would have worked. If I knew this would happen, I would have retained some special skills. No, this isn't right. You've realized it, haven't you? Everything is under my control. At this rate... Very good, Shalltear. This is where the climax begins. Lord Ainz won. Why? In my opinion, we can't be sure who the winner will be yet. Shalltear gave up on defense and chose to attack. If I was in that situation, I'm afraid I would do the same. Lord Ainz kept changing his weapon. That means we're not sure what kind of weapon he'll use next. Under circumstances where information is lacking, putting a distance between them might bring death upon herself. That's what she thought when she saw the bow. So Shalltear can only choose to battle within the range of the Spuit Lance. I see. I think I get it now. That's why Lord Ainz took out the ax, Blood-Sucking Flesh-Eating-- To deal with Shalltear, who gave up on defense. Thank you, Cocytus. Even if the balance of Blood-Sucking Flesh-Eating is very bad and its hit rate is also not high, it's not a problem to deal with Shalltear, who gave up on defense. I didn't expect that the entire battle has always been part of Lord Ainz's plan. But Shalltear can recover her HP using the Spuit Lance. Lord Ainz can't use other magic spells in warrior form. Is that a disadvantage on Lord Ainz's part? You don't need to worry about that. The one who calls himself Ainz Ooal Gown put his reputation on the line to announce victory. This feels like... Lord Ainz. It seems like you're the one who'll use up your HP first. Do you really think so? Momonga. The time you set has passed. Lady Bukubukuchagama? Hey. What time do you think has passed? If everything has been part of my plan, what do you think it means for the set time to have passed? It means the battle outcome is set. This battle is over. What are you talking about? My HP is still... Super-tier magic spells won't kill you in one shot if your HP is full. I can do so when your HP is very low though, don't you think? My close-distance fighting ability might be lower than yours, but I'm higher in magic defense. I'll go ahead then, Shalltear. Super-tier Magic. Lord Ainz. Why use a super-tier spell with such a long activation time now? Could that also be equipment from the Cash Item Shop? Fallen Down. Long live Lord Ainz Ooal Gown! You're the strongest Supreme Being in Nazarick indeed. Shorty. What a fool. How can an undead have their consciousness controlled? What did you-- Nothing. The battle outcome... An overwhelming victory for Lord Ainz. Let's go back too. I'm going to resurrect Shalltear then. Albedo, watch her name on the list closely. If it's still the same as when her consciousness was being controlled... Lord Ainz. If that is the case, forgive me for overstepping, please let us handle it. Demiurge. If we continue to let something threaten your safety, we're not fulfilling our duties. No, but... If Shalltear is still rebelling, let the guardians like us handle it. Please just watch us, Supreme One. All right. Guardians. If that's really the case, I'll let you handle it. It's enough for you to stay here, Lord Ainz. If all the Supreme Beings are gone, who should we pledge our loyalty to? Even if we knew we weren't abandoned, it would still be very lonely without you. I see. It's indeed lonely to have no one else around. Guardians. Protect me. And now let us begin! -Yes! -Yes! Five hundred million gold coins for Shalltear's resurrection. Shalltear, resurrect. Albedo. SHALLTEAR BLOODFALLEN Please don't worry. Her consciousness isn't under control anymore. Is that so? Shalltear. Lord Ainz. This is great. No, I should apologize first. It's all my fault. What? No. Even if I don't know what happened, but how can you be at fault, Lord Ainz? Here, I'm going to have my first-- Lord Ainz. Shalltear must be very tired. You're right. Let's talk more later. By the way, Lord Ainz, why am I here between the thrones? And why am I wearing this? And the way you are treating me... Did I get into some sort of trouble? Don't you remember? No. That means Shalltear doesn't know who used a World Item on her? Do you feel different? I don't think so. Is that so? Lord Ainz! My breasts are gone! Did you say that because you're aware of your current situation? Don't you remember? That was a shameful act as a guardian! Shalltear. You did something unforgivable to Lord Ainz, you fool. To you, what does it mean to be a guardian? Do you know how sad Lord Ainz was? I agree. Speaking of which, you have always been obsessed with your own desires. Lord Ainz. Albedo. Please scold Shalltear too, Lord Ainz. Exactly. Give this fool a hard scolding. That's right. It's better to scold her properly. Shalltear, you must listen carefully to Lord Ainz's words. But don't be too strict. Well... I want to say this to every one of you. I wasn't able to predict that this incident would happen even after receiving differing information. So I'm the one who should be blamed the most. Shalltear, you didn't do anything wrong. Remember that. Thank you. Regarding what happened to Shalltear, Demiurge will tell you all about it. Yes. By the way, Sebas hasn't returned to Nazarick yet. He is bait. Even if I don't know why our enemy did that to Shalltear, if they have another target next, it's possibly Sebas, who went with her. Albedo. Choose someone to secretly monitor Sebas' surroundings. Yes. Sebas is bait, but I won't sit and wait for him to be taken. We must stop the enemy when they approach him. I'll surely meet the one who used a World Item on Shalltear soon. I'll surely make him pay for this. Also, I might be too naive. The unknown enemy who can hurt us must be around Nazarick. I want to strengthen Nazarick's power quickly. For one, I want to use my skill to create an army of undead. Lord Ainz, regarding that... If you create an army of undead with your skill, using human corpses, they can only become mid-level undead of below level 40, right? That's right. Actually, Aura discovered a village of lizardmen. What do you think about going there to attack and eliminate them? I can't believe that the Black Scripture, known as the strongest in Slane Theocracy, lost to a vampire. Even if Lord Kralgra used Downfall of Castle and Country, he was struck before completely controlling the vampire. We lost two people and another one is injured. That's why I decided that retreating was our best option. What should we do? Nigun's whereabouts are unknown due to the incident with the Sunlight Scripture. The Windflower Scripture is currently investigating the whereabouts of the traitor who took the sacred item from Shaman Princess. We can only conduct the lowest level of monitoring and leave it as is. Besides, if a creature can defeat that monster, he's the one we must be wary of the most. Understood.
