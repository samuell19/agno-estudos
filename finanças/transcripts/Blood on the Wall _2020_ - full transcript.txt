I'll tell you something a guy who grows up in a rich neighborhood with a father who is a lawyer or a politician got it easy, man This a big chunk of cash $100,000 in each package there are other guys whose parents have to slave in a store And that's just for 500. Pro te mas. How do you know my struggle? Have you slept in a park? Have you cried yourself to sleep? When you were 12 years old? I got 5 kids and I'm only 22 years old so you tell me did I do wrong or did I do right? Goddamn gringos they didn't get us We are bringing $120,000 dollars We make 3 trips per week to deliver money This money is for 3 kilos of heroin There is a saying that goes United States gives the weapons Mexico gives the dead Americans engage in the wars they want in Mexico war just shows up There are a number of organizations that are in the narcotrafficking business and the production of drugs but now Mexico is too contaminated the areas that should be cleaned up are the ones operated by the southern cartels which are the most conflicted areas Mexico never had, uh, the rule of law. There was no such thing and there has been no such thing. What there was under the long-time pre-authoritarian regime was what people called... Una estado de orden... the rule of order. The PRI was able to rule Mexico for nearly 70 years. It was able to deliver the goods with enough growth, enough construction of the middle class to make people reasonably happy. It was a party that was going to permit modernity in Mexico. But in reality what it was, was a mechanism of control of power. Corruption in Mexico went from being an isolated incident to be a political system Throughout the years the PRI party became the crime administrator from its position of power The problem of course came when economic growth was not what it used to be and they stopped delivering the goods, and there were a series of greater tensions with the United States, which also made life very difficult. There are no jobs here there are few ways to survive you've got do what you've got do weapons and migration are treated as if they are both a crime but you never know the reality of an immigrant People migrate out of need Migration is not a crime because we have the right to a better life Border officials expect today another caravan from Central America arriving to the border between Guatemala and Mexico We are in Guatemala and we'll make it to Mexico We are not criminals! We are workers! I need to find my boyfriend if I am not with him I don't feel protected because if someone wants to hurt me I know he will protect me there he is This is serious "border love" I wasn't planning to leave my country but when I saw the caravan leaving I gave it a thought I don't have family in Honduras I have no job or a place to sleep I should leave maybe my life will change there I just turned 17 I truly hope that my life will change In Honduras lots of young women are raped I am a rape victim The gangs commit crimes and we get blamed They have to capture the gangsters and rapists The reason we are here is because our goddamn president where are the jobs and projects that would employ young people? That's why we are migrating here I just want to see you and kiss you because nobody can love you like I do Nobody will tell you I love you like me All these guys we know each other since we were kids and they have never left me alone for me they are my family not blood family but hood family I called Mexico, said, look, I hope you're not gonna let these people come through your country and march 1,000 miles up through your country and come through our border. Everybody wants to go through Mexico, they don't wanna stay in Mexico, so that's the plan right there. I hope that, uh, Mexican authorities doesn't stop us. The people united will never be defeated Mexico here we come This caravan is causing militarization and closing at the southern border We crossed It's being stopped as of this moment by Mexico, so we appreciate very much what Mexico's doing but as of this moment you see what's happening. It's being stopped. What we are looking for is what we can't find in our country I came to have a future to leave suffering behind It gives me strength and motivation to travel with the people in the caravan We have no money people here in Guatemala have supported us they have given us food water and clothing I left Honduras with 1,000 lempiras We are about 15 people Only men I am the only girl in this group We know we'll encounter gangs and extortion and cartels but if we stick together we'll defend ourselves Cross over! You can do it! People crossed the river and are already in Mexico nobody is being detained Then let's cross the river Let's do it It feels so nice to be in the water We are so happy to step into Mexico Mexico here we are! I have never traveled in a caravan but I heard that children are allowed We left Guatemala because my stepfather was causing problems my mother suffered his abuses my brothers were beaten the problems started when he got involved in drug trafficking There was so much violence that we couldn't go out there is a gang that comes from the city to kill recently they killed a little girl we knew she was only 10 years old they shot her Now we are waiting for the Mexican humanitarian visa In Mexico humanitarian visas are for sale some may spend months filling out requirements in Mexico you can buy a visa for 50,000 pesos The United States border will start here Chiapas will be the biggest funnel for people who want to get to the Northern border People help us out they give us food we appreciate that people give us food or water I want to go all the way to Tijuana but I have to protect my kids from the youngest to the oldest There are risks when you have women who are traveling by themselves. They are exposed to rape and extortion. This is why you start to see the development of the caravans because the caravan is a way at least for people to be slightly more safe and to avoid being in the hands of people who will hurt them and maybe kill them. In San Fernando, Tamaulipas 72 bodies were found they are presumably migrants For example, a group of Central American migrants were kidnapped. They were lined up against the wall, handcuffed and executed by a drug cartel called Los Zetas. The, uh, Zetas feared that these migrants were gonna become recruits for an opposing cartel. In the same area they found another mass grave of migrants from Central America primarily, with 193 people. If you were trying to understand who these migrants are, I would describe them as people who are fleeing from deadly criminal violence. People will often refer to U.S. Foreign Policy as being the cause of failed states, certainly Honduras and, uh, El Salvador, uh, if not so much in Guatemala. And, uh, there's no question that the United States, uh, bears responsibility for wars in, uh, Central America. The U.S. in the midst of the second part of the Cold War, uh, seized Central America as the proverbial domino of Communist Soviet influence in the Americas. My fellow Americans, I must speak to you tonight about a mounting danger in Central America that threatens the security of the United States. Central America has a long record with the USA, they have a record of invasions, they have a record of wars. They have records of interventions. And they have a record that has pragmated Mexico. The record of training for violence. War! Kill Blood Die Though I think that we have to look at this human tragedy that affects so much people as a regional problem and it is a problem that goes from the USA to Columbia. Poppies in the mountains have been sown for over 40 years and after all these years people continue to be screwed I know this is against the law but how am I supposed to get the money to dress my children? On a good day we get one and a half kilos of gum These people are not narco-traffickers they farm a plant that is illegal because it is the only thing they have been taught The government didn't teach them this trade outsiders came to teach them how to grow poppies People from Sinaloa came here and taught us how to grow this plant The history of Mexico has left aside its indigenous people. They have been victims of this war against drugs. Many times they have been slaved to produce the drug products. Once we take the gum out of the poppy that is the end of the farmer's job from there on the narco-trafficking starts it all ends up in the United States Nowadays there is not much work our business is not doing well making pure heroin became expensive synthetic opioids took over the market and our business has gone down the drain this is already dried it takes about 3 hours of work to get 2 kilos if it gets wet then you ruin it out of ten kilos you may get about one kilo let's see how much we got here let's say this is 5 kilos which is about 35,000 pesos in the United States we sell it for much more and get a huge profit From the late '70s through the '90s organized crime began to grow. And they became these huge organizations that the country truly hadn't seen before. Now this began in Sinaloa, particularly the mountains of where El Chapo is from. They were loosely tied geographically based smugglers, who would smuggle anything, chili peppers, tires, blue jeans, whatever they thought they could get up to the U.S. border, uh, for profit. Now in the 1970s, many of them left the mountains of Sinaloa and relocated to Guadalajara. So suddenly you had Mexico's drug trade not in a backwater province, but in Mexico's second city: Guadalajara. That's when the cartel got strong and by the 1980s they were a very powerful group DEA was trying to get Washington to pay attention to Mexico and Washington was like yeah, Mexico, a bunch of hicks trafficking drugs. No big deal. Columbia's where the big drug traffickers are. And they're like, no, no, there's a cartel in Mexico, it's the Guadalajara Cartel, which is a federation of criminals who share resources, who share political connections. And they began to produce particularly marijuana on an industrial scale, the biggest marijuana plantations the world had ever seen. In 1984 a huge ranch was discovered the Buffalo ranch owned by Rafael Caro Quintero it was later discovered that the plantation had the blessing of the U.S. the plan was that the money collected with the sale of this crop would fund the Contras in Nicaragua a plan masterminded by Oliver North The subject of today's hearings, allegations of CIA involvement in the United States drug sales to finance the Contras in the Nicaraguan War. You made false statements to them about your activities in support of the contras. I misled the Congress. I did. In the 1980s the demand of drugs in the U.S. changed and cocaine consumption increased and the cocaine was sent from Columbia to the United States by the Caribbean route but President Ronald Reagan closed the drug trafficking Caribbean route Captain, that was your last set of warning shots. And that forced the Columbians to use Mexico and its drugtrafficking organizations So the Guadalajara cartel also got into expanding the trafficking of cocaine from Columbia and their connection to South America was the Honduran trafficker, Juan Ramón Matta-Ballesteros. He was playing this role of connecting the Columbians and the Mexicans and he was connected to the military and the Honduran military at the time was servicing U.S. interests. He was helping the Honduran military and the U.S. move goods, perhaps even weapons, down to the counter-revolutionary forces in Nicaragua, known as the Contras. And in his own private side, he was moving cocaine north to the United States in his aircraft. At the same time, the Columbian cartels had decided to better incentivize their Mexican colleagues and started paying Mexican drug syndicates instead of money with cocaine, with produce. All this cocaine money just flooded in and the drug cartels, they weren't a bunch of hicks from the Sinaloa Mountains anymore, these guys were starting to make huge amounts of money. The American DEA agents, one of them in particular, became a thorn in the side of the Guadalajara Cartel and that was Enrique "Kike" Camarena. He began to find out about their huge marijuana plantations and pressured for them to be busted. The Drug Enforcement Administration chief in Mexico identified the bodies as DEA agent Enrique Camarena and pilot Alfredo Zavala. When they kidnapped and murdered Kike Camarena, there was a huge reaction from the Americans and under the pressure, Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca, and Head of the Guadalajara Cartel Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo was arrested. Most of history of the next 20 years is partially explained by that moment because out of that arose what was later known as the Sinaloa Cartel. So what became the Sinaloa Cartel was really a federation of gangster warlords and. These included Ismael Zambada, El Chapo and also his childhood friend, who was from a village right next to his, Arturo Beltrán Leyva. Now together they reorganized the drug trafficking business to become the biggest cartel in Mexico. Everyone had their own territories Tijuana Nogales Juarez each one commanded their own turf their business was united El Chapo and the Beltrán Leyvas worked together since the early days of the narco business they were lifelong allies Wahoo! When I was a child I would look at El Chapo's people I wanted to be just like them my dream was to work for El Chapo one day we know El Chapo is famous he has helped people in these towns and we would like to see him out of prison El Chapo had a political discourse about Sinaloa and he would speak for all the people and he got our support if he hadn't been caught maybe we would be less doomed In Acapulco in the early 90s everything was controlled by the narcos they had a golden life with a party lifestyle they started buying nightclubs they had surveillance posts along the coast it was a period when we had peace The narcos were all a happy family the had a kind of consortium and they divided the Mexican territory and the states of Guerrero and Morelos was owned by Arturo Beltran the Beltrans were the owners of the turf Also El Chapo ran the Cartel of Sinaloa There was the Carrillo family of Ciudad Juarez There was the Arellano family of Tijuana and Osiel Cárdenas of Tamaulipas And they kept a relative peace if someone crossed the line they would kill him that was it Then you had very clear rules of engagement and very clear people with whom you know you need to speak in order to get things done. At this point, there's accusations that the drug trafficking business was controlled from the presidential palace itself with allegations that point man was Raúl Salinas, the president's own brother. It seems the narcos could reach the very pinnacle of power. The Sinaloa cartel continues to work in an orderly manner but many people enjoy killing without a reason they get addicted to killing as if it was a drug I don't you can't break the rules if someone doesn't want to obey the rules they will call me and I know what I have to do I will bring him alive or dead to the boss it's that simple if it cannot take him in good terms I would take him in bad terms The great majority of the people who are coming now are not coming from Mexico, they're coming from Central America. This situation was created because of the authorities in California deporting criminal gang, MS-13, to El Salvador. But they did not give El Salvador any warning and they were not prepared for this type of criminal organization. I am going swimming Everyone is here It's cold I've seen videos of big snakes they can eat a whole person at once We pretend this an adventurous vacation we organize games for them and when they are sad I tell them that the place we are going is better Just because we are migrants it doesn't mean we are criminals or bad people In the 1990s, the economic system began to change towards what people call neo-liberalism, economic liberalization, privatizations, with the expectation this is going to promote dynamic economic growth and inclusiveness. And it turns out what we have is very low growth, huge concentration of wealth. The Mexican government favored a few groups, a few individuals at the expense of the broader population. Mexico has also expelled its own people especially from the indigenous regions this is one of the countries where the gap between the super rich and the poor has widened more in recent years The indigenous people in this country have the highest levels of marginalization political oppression and racial discrimination These people have been stripped of their land and natural resources We're entering a new era of economic development NAFTA-the free trade agreement comes into effect On New Year's Eve many Mexicans went to bed hoping they would wake up to a first world utopia where they could buy all kinds of products Mexico, Mexico! 1994 was a defining year for Mexico. There was an armed uprising by the Zapatistas. We are asking for an amendment to NAFTA our petition has infuriated the government And it was the beginning of the end for the PRI. The country began one of its worst economic crises. Mexico's main demand is democracy Its presidential candidate was murdered. And this all brought Mexico right to the edge. In the year 2000 Mexico went through this huge political change. The PRI lost the presidency for the first time in 71 years. You began to see the decentralization of power. The underworld, they no longer have a single interlocutor. That was something new and what that did is that opened up space for these increasingly large criminal groups to take more of the pie. As the competition rises, they begin to arm themselves in a way that is much more military, literally having gun battles. In public spaces, very often. This is the first time he is on a train No big deal just like riding a bus The Army guards the area where Felipe Calderón will be sworn in as the new president Calderón won by a margin of point .56% so it was the smallest margin in the history of the presidential elections. Members of Congress please go back to your seats I won the election, in very tight elections, in 2006. My opponent tried to block the inauguration ceremony but I was able to overcome that situation, I got into the Congress parlors and I made my oath of office. Fraud! Fraud! Felipe Calderón came to power in 2006 and 14 days into the office he launched the so-called war on drugs He felt that he needed to legitimize his administration by doing something spectacular. I never declared a war on drugs, never. But it's quite common to say the war on drugs that President Calderón declared. That's, it's false. The main issue for me was rule of law and security for the people. At least 40 hours lasted the battle between federal forces and sicarios of the Michoacan Cartel Calderón, he went in there thinking he would, you know, hit with the power of the state and things would calm down. But the opposite happened. The drug traffickers murdering high-level officials and you start to see the drug cartels using incredible violence against each other. The violence sky rockets, the violence really runs out of control. There was really no turning back. He had, he had opened the Pandora's box at that stage. President Calderón is taking a tough stand against, uh, organized crime and drugs. In 2007, the Merida Initiative was set up between Mexico and the United States. Mr. President, you and I have laid the foundation. The Bush Administration agreed that because you had guns and bulk cash moving from the United States into Mexico, the U.S. needed to put some skin into the game. Finally the Americans would experience... accept their responsibility for being a consumer country and that they have to attack demand as well as supply. America's public enemy number one... Every American President since Nixon has said that. The most serious problem today is cocaine. We want to reduce our demand for... But no American president... When there is demand, there is supply. Because they're not crazy has gone after to reduce the consumption of drugs in the United States. Why? Because it's not something American society is willing to pay. When the Calderón Administration came in, the focus was on the resting and decapitating the leadership of the drug syndicates, the so-called kingpin strategy. Alfredo Beltran Leyva is accused of being one of the leaders of the Beltran Leyva brothers cartel The Public Secretary Office informs of the capture of Edgar Valdez Villareal Gerardo Alvarez Vázquez Eduardo Teodoro Garcia Simental alias El Teo In coordination and support of the governors and mayors, the strategy was successful. We captured probably 25 of the 34. The chief of chiefs has fallen in Cuernavaca's downtown The kingpin strategy to eliminate the leaders was a failure When the government attacked the cartels a pact was broken and this unleashed the violence in Acapulco ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Acapulco, golden tides are going in ♪ ♪ Acapulco, golden tides are going in ♪♪ In the 50s and 60s Acapulco was very vibrant This is the place that many Hollywood people call the sunshine Shangri-La. Many people spent their honeymoon here JFK and Jackie were here Elizabeth Taylor married here Acapulco celebrities including George Hamilton enjoys the festivities. Acapulco was beautiful beach, beautiful sea, a place where families went. But Acapulco became a favorite of the drug trade because it is a port of entry. A frontier nearby the Sierra Guerrero where you have the poppy plantations, where you have the production of drugs that then can go out through the sea. Photojournalists in Acapulco have a dangerous life you've got to be in the street all the time and the streets in Acapulco are very dangerous Every job in this town is a risky business Arturo Beltran Leyva was the most senior narco El Chapo Guzman started as Arturo's bodyguard Arturo taught all the tricks to El Chapo when the government killed Arturo Beltran new local groups emerged and that's what provoked the chaos It got worse with Arturo Beltran's death that's when it all fell apart What's gained by cutting off the leaders? All hell breaks loose what are the street gangs supposed to do? They'll have to kidnap and extort for their own survival that's just another war Acapulco is a violent city Acapulco is an ugly city Acapulco is unsafe but it's the coolest place I grew up in this neighborhood These are my brothers the gang Acapulocos these are my neighborhood friends We don't praise violence we are just a product of the environment of what life is here This is the feathered serpent the eagle devouring the serpent the coat of arms of Guerrero the state where I was born this is our culture our ancestors marked their bodies the Aztecs and the Nahuas we are like them but in a different scenario We got a report of a woman killed here The changes in Acapulco are significant due to organized crime these groups own the turfs here The municipal police work in collusion with them they are their street informants they are the armed force of the organized crime there are cases in which the municipal police have disappeared people For us the taxi drivers killings have increased and the main reason is extortion I believe last year 127 taxi drivers were murdered that's why now we pay the extortion fee some pay less some pay more but we all pay When the drug business is scarce the narcos look for other ways to make money and the easy way is extortion this is an easy way to get money so that they can survive and hold on to their turf I'm totally against extortions or kidnappings I have killed my own people because they did that and I won't allow it We no longer have foreign tourists cruises arrive and people don't get off you don't see Americans or Canadians in the streets For example all these were prosperous businesses international brands like Gucci now are all closed For me it would be good to have tourism I work selling drugs it's like any other business people benefit and I do too that's why I want to fix things I want to do business like Arturo Beltran because he was a good leader Somehow we need to find a middle ground we want a pact for peace with everyone everyone needs to be part of the solution even our brothers of the organized crime Someone was shot this just happened but people continue with their life as usual they continue eating like nothing happened as if there was not a dead body here A human head was found and the police have arrived now The basic institutions of the Mexican state, the police, the courts, every day display, uh, the incompetence and politicization and corruption that makes them dysfunctional. This is a country where 98% of crimes are never solved. And what does this mean for an ordinary Mexican? That if you are the victim of a crime, the probability of their being some sort of rule of law solution to your issue will not happen. A relationship exists between crime and police forces otherwise you could not explain the crime levels in the country how crime levels are sustained and the high rates of impunity The municipal police mind their own business they don't mess with us and we don't bother them if someone doesn't want to work with us they just have to leave us alone but 80% of municipal police works for us The army can give us some trouble also the Marines and some Federal Police they can be problematic but if I see a municipal officer we just say hello My mom's great grandmother made it to the United States but she returned to Guatemala because she wanted to die in her homeland when I get to be an old man I want to return to my homeland and die there Did you find the papers? I already checked there I am upset because we lost my legal documents and the kids' documents I will keep searching but I think they are lost people may question if they are my children they don't believe that they are mine without papers, how can I prove it? We've been together for 2 years but I know her since she was a little girl we have shared hard times we've been homeless we've starved together We've been cold Hot We endured long walks we faced people who look at us with disdain people who believe that all migrants are the same Here in Mexico there are narco-traffickers prostitution rings and violence yesterday we realized that they were stealing children they cover women's noses with something it seems to be a drug that makes you faint I am afraid but God knows my way I am a bit concerned Under the bridge 10 km from here they dumped a body wrapped in bed sheets he was tied up the message is that we can also be killed The state of Guerrero is a region with a high number of disappeared people are desperate they want to know where their loved ones are they want to find the corpses to find some peace and comfort when I see the federal police or the state police or the army they scare me more than narco-traffickers We search for all the disappeared who probably are in a mass grave My name is Mario Vergara I am looking for my brother Tomás kidnapped on July 5, 2012 to this day he is still missing Every day 13 people disappear in our country The government doesn't search for our relatives This is a skull this boy has a bullet in the head and was tied up according to the position in which he fell he was shot and fell forward In the area of Iguala we found more than 3,000 fragments or whole bones scattered in the hills It would be a miracle if my sons were found alive how can one live with such a pain? We had to face the Mexican government a government that lies and represses us It's so regrettable dead bodies were found the authorities have been exposed for their lack of responsibility Those who should take care of us are disappearing us Ayotzinapa is a landmark case in this country Ayotzinapa proved what we shout out loud but they don't want to hear the Ayotzinapa students were disappeared by three institutions of the government municipal, state, and federal government They have killed one of us they killed him call an ambulance Why are you after us? Goddamn dogs It's not easy to see your classmate die watch them take away your friends and not be able to help them What we don't want is to see this happening again it's the worst thing that can happen to you to have a son disappeared is like dying because you will never have peace The problem's ultimately political and has to do with accountability. Who is responsible for what, what agencies are responsible for fighting crime, who is accountable by the system and the answer is no one. The truth is that authorities can't stop violence When your friends are murdered when your relatives are disappeared when working families are extorted and nobody takes responsibility people start to organize themselves We heard that two armed groups are fighting for control of the town This is the ranch of the criminal group DUMBOS the DUMBOs started in the business of illegal sale of gasoline that didn't bother anyone but later they began assaulting our citizens Apparently the crocodile was being fed human flesh by the DUMBOS but we haven't confirmed it yet It all started when the UPOEG came to our town they wanted to subject people by fear they tried to recruit them by force they cannot tell me to disarm my people to put us in the hands of Ernesto Gallardo The Federal Police are here also the Marines and the Army they have surrounded the police station where the UPOEG community police is When we tried to repel the DUMBOS the Marines came after us because we interfered with DUMBOS' interests but the citizens took charge and they stopped the government We are blocking the road because they want to disarm our community police UPOEG they are the only organization that we trust to keep us safe We don't agree we just want the Marines we don't support either group they don't think about the people What the government is trying to do is to regain control and to disarm the UPOEG community police We want the government, government, government We have two alternatives either the UPOEG keeps their guns or the UPOEG is disarmed and the army stays the agreement we have reached is the UPEOG keeps the guns and army leaves No, this is not possible! Who is going to be responsible for our safety? We don't know what deal they made with UPOEG so the police leaves the area Let's go It's a complex situation people are upset they would rather defend themselves than trust the police or the Marines It's always the same story the government doesn't deliver a solution That's community police area The UPOEG community police carry the same kind of weapons as the Marines where do they get them? These weapons are exclusive for the Army Mexico is one of the most corrupt countries our authorities are colluded with narc-traffickers and the politicians steal money we live the consequences in Acapulco on a daily bases The state is corrupt and allows illegal actions to share the profits from it at the moment there are 13 governors accused of stealing people's money from public funds In my government no one will benefit from impunity no group or person regardless of their power will be allowed to do illegal business under the protection of the government Why Andrés Manuel López Obrador won the last election? Because he pointed out corruption. He pointed out how the rule of law is an aspiration or exists only to protect the powerful. He denounced the status quo that does not work. The country will have an orderly and peaceful transformation we will end the corruption and impunity that prevent Mexico's renaissance The real question now is whether he'll have the vision and the statesmanship to build institutions to contain the enormous power that was granted to him in this election. I accept the challenge Long live Mexico! We'll be right back Get her some shoes! The camp bathrooms are not clean anymore too many people are using them that's why I don't use them Damn, we just realized we won't be able to withdraw money transfers the bank accounts are blocked what we are going to do without money? Because here we don't get enough food Got spare change boss? Begging for money Drug traffickers represent the most dire challenge to the rule of law in Mexico. If the demand for drugs is completely inelastic and the supply for drugs is completely elastic, by putting pressure on the demand side of the equation, the only thing that you're doing is creating economic incentives for new players to come into the business of production and trafficking. The first step is to blend the alcohol adding benzyl cyanide and water everything is cooked in this pot this machine heats it all up and when steam comes out we turn it off These hoses are connected to barrels of water the water minimizes the smoke so the helicopters don't see the smoke What do you call this product? We call it black or red oil Look at the illegal drug market, Americans spend according to the U.S. government $100 billion every year on illegal drugs. Oil and water we add chlorine to the mix and now it is just a matter of stirring But also look at the deeper issues of why people in these poor communities that grow up with unpaved streets, with electricity not working, with no running water, are recruited so easily by drug cartels. This is it we call it Galleta While you produce this are you aware of the damage this causes to the users? Yes, we are aware but life is hard what we are supposed to do to help our families? My boyfriend turned himself in to be deported back to Honduras I am sad and want to cry I told him just go away I don't wanna see you anymore he took his backpack and I was left crying I don't want to continue without him because with him I feel safe and protected but without him I feel vulnerable I feel incomplete like something is missing You are the most handsome man on the world I love you and you are always on my mind Let's go over there Should I try it? I will be fine, right? You're my friends You decide for yourself OK, I will try it This shit is like Satan this is strong stuff It could give you a holy death wait wait Ludy first let it burn if you smoke this part it will mess you up don't swallow it just smoke it This is a very dangerous life Here you only got 2 options prison or dead the surveillance plane is flying high at this point I cannot go back The real fight against organized crime is in the financial circuits It's extremely hard for a sovereign country to get a hold of and go after those institutions when many of those institutions are really involved in the flowing economy of their country. Another scandal. Giant HSBC had given terrorists and drug dealers access to America's financial system. Isn't this kind of shocking? I'm not gonna quarrel with you, Senator, of course. Until we go after CEOs, the ones that have repeatedly ignored the law or regulations on the international scale and we charge them criminally, I think we're gonna be embroiled in this type of money laundering as long as the cartels exist. Wachovia bank received deposits from the Sinaloa cartel in the amount of $378 billion dollars this amount is equivalent to one-third of Mexico's Gross Domestic Product Once the Mexican state decides to launch an investigation on their finances maybe then we will be able to dismantle the monstrous criminal activity that is rooted in Mexico for years I tried a drug called crystal a drug you smoke in a light bulb I didn't like it it makes you feel doubtful and confused I don't wanna do it again if I know that something is bad I can fix it I can make my own decisions and I can choose my own path At this point we have 20,000 people along the border, basically living in shelters at the kindness of strangers, living on the streets in many cases, there's no support from the United States for these people and the Mexican government has not provided any support either. These illegal caravans won't be allowed in the U.S. People should turn back now We have sent U.S. military forces to the border to do their job President Trump unleashed a tweet storm threatening to close the southern border with Mexico... Consider deploying between ten of 15,000 military personnel to the U.S. Mexico border. I turned myself to the Mexican authorities because I want to go back to Honduras It is harder to get food here I am about 2 months pregnant We double pack the drugs and we use a special paper to trick the security dogs We are taking it to Los Angeles there each kilo is worth $25,000 and if we take it to New York we get $45,000 per kilo it's easy to cross the border because we bribe people there's a lot of corruption in the United States we take orders for heroin cocaine and crystal meth I didn't want to do this job I wanted to be a doctor or a professional but I need to eat so I have to do this No, there's no way out. Especially if you're one of the ones that take out the most drugs. You're valuable. You ain't gonna leave like that. You gotta make me money. This business is like anything else what we do is not right or wrong it's just my business and I do what I got to do if someone wants to consume drugs it is their own decision I move weapons to Mexico and I cross drugs into the U.S. I don't get nervous I am used to this job and I am not afraid Where to? To Phoenix What's your business? I live there This is the perfect business it doesn't end it will be eternal I am going to enter the U.S. look I am in I wish I was on the other side already but this fence doesn't allow me and those green people would stop me This is what separates me from my dad I didn't grow up with my father I've never met him and my mother worked all the time as a child nobody looked after me these kids don't have a father either my role is to be the father figure in the family I wouldn't want to be separated from my family In spite of everything we are still together in good times and bad times and even in desperate times Charol has wished to go back but I am always here for her to give her strength to keep moving forward I remind her that we do it for the children We are a big family we have better chances crossing if we separate we will reunite once we cross Are you afraid? Yes It will be over soon Dylan kiss me goodbye It is time to cross this is good place to cross because there are not many migration officers Keep going straight ahead Get down! This path will take them to San Diego the border fence ends here Do you see the hill over there? We've got to run over there They've crossed they are now in the United States All the drugs we bring from Mexico are pre-sold some people think that this is an easy job but you are always at risk if you hear the sirens it could be the end of you Everyone feels fear but you tighten your balls and go with it Hello are you ready? I'll meet you in 15 minutes Captioned by Cotter Media Group.
