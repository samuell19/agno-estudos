It's a Blu-rod. - [Denise] You idiot, I can get one of these for 30 bucks at Walmart. - Well then go sell and get 30 bucks. - [Denise] Do I look like a Walmart to you, moron? Ain't nobody gonna give me 30 bucks for it. - I'll take it. - [Denise] Don't be stupider than your brother. - Woman, them are mine. - [Denise] Not until you go get divorce papers signed by a judge, till then, everything is just as much mine as it is yours. - Why don't you go back in the house and leave us alone. We're busy right now. - Well, I can see that. Why I married someone as worthless as you, is beyond me! - Don't you do it. - [Denise] Do what, huh? Yeah, worthless. - You're gonna get out of here before I up and throw you out of here. Daryl can help me lift. - Not really with my bad arm, Larry. - That's all right, man. - Watch, watch, here it is. Boom! - Oh! - Are you watching another one of those ridiculous cat videos? No offense, Jessica, I know how much you love your cat. - None taken, sir. - All right, before we start briefing, as you've you've noticed we have some new meat.

Good. You know, 'cause I'm gonna assign you as his FTO.

Uh, the prosecutor's office, they request more detail in our reports. Want more quoted testimony, so take good notes, okay? All right, some things never change. All right, you be safe out there guys. [Jessica clears throat] And girls. - Aren't you lucky. - I know. I'm always nice to you. - [Captain] How about be nice to your new partner? - Hey, rook. My name's Colton, lots of people call me Colt. - I'm Shep, looks like you're on my detail for the next four weeks. Let's go see what you're made of. Start with coffee. We can get us a couple down here. [speaking in foreign language] - [Shep] What, you heard the Captain, rook. Be sure to take good notes. - [Colton] Yeah, we want to see some quoted testimony in your report. - Okay, ma'am-- [speaking in foreign language] - How long should we leave him? - Ah, a few more seconds. All right rook, come on, we'll handle the report. - Thank you, ma'am. What just happened up there? - No idea. You guys hungry? - I'm eating with Lauren and Gabe. - Such a family man. - You're just jealous, 'cause I have someone who loves me. - Your wife loves everybody. So what do you eat? - I like-- - Today you like hamburgers, let's go. - [Colton] All right, see ya. - [Shep] Tell Lauren, hi - [Colton] Yep. - [Gabe] Hey, dad. - Hey, hey, buddy. - Hey, baby. - Hey babe, how are you? - [Lauren] Good. How's the shift going? - Oh, the usual. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Here you go, sir. - Oh, thank you. - Did you catch any bad guys, yet? - [Colton] [laughs] No, not yet. - [Gabe] That's boring. - Hey, sometimes boring is good. - Yes. I went ahead and ordered, so we'd have a little time. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, you didn't tell me that that pastor is also your new chaplain. - I didn't know that. - Yeah. - Where'd you hear that? - Here you all go. - Thanks very much. The department spouse support group sent out an email. All right. Gabe, you want to bless the food? - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. - God is great, God is good. Let us thank him for our food, amen. God bless America, amen. - God bless America. - That's right. [laughs] - Nice job. - Good job, bud. - Nice. [Lauren laughing] - Oh, please keep my daddy safe. [warm music] - Thank you, buddy. Okay, ready? - I'm so tired of this game. - You dropped it last time. - Colton, no, I'm terrible. Don't throw it. - You have to catch it. - No, I can't catch it. You know I'm terrible - All right, ready, one, two, three. [laughing] - [laughs] That's the closest we've come. - [Dispatcher] Copy your resident at 1170 Pine Street.

Taking this for the road. - See you later. - Bye. - Hey, eat your food, okay, buddy. - Every time. - I know, I know. - If you don't mind, I'd like to pick up that family's check right over there. - All right. - Need any refills here? - Ah, no we're good. I think just probably a couple boxes and the check. - [Waitress] The boxes I can do, but there ain't no check. - Um. - It's been taken care of. [twangy guitar music] - Got his head. - Man, I'm hungry, man. - Well, me too. - We got anything to eat? - Uh, Blu-ray player. [laughs] [Larry laughs mockingly] - How'd you like me to use your head as a T-stand, Daryl? - [Daryl] [sighs] Whatever. - Dang, man. - Home run. [refrigerator humming] - [Denise] What you doing in my house? - Oh, it's half mine too, remember? - It's my mama's. - Why ain't there no food in there? - Well, I don't know. Maybe because my worthless husband spent all his disability on beer for him and his stupid brother! - Come on, Denise, I ain't in the mood for your mouth today, why don't you just shut your lip. - Oh, I'm scared. What ya gonna do, Larry? [chair clatters] - I said shut it! - Go ahead Larry, hit me. I'll call he cops and they'll send you back to jail.

Just the wrong place, wrong time. You all right? - You believe in God, Shep? - You getting philosophical with me? - Why does he let this happen? - You are getting philosophical with me. - I mean it. Why does a kid die and drug dealer get off scot free? - Well, the only answer to that is there isn't a God. - I don't get it. [sighs] I don't get it. Same thing, cops get killed. People that kill them get off scot free. It's bull. - David, again. Colt. Look, man. What happened that night, it happened. You know, there's not like a rhyme or reason to it. It just, it happened. We know the risk every time we put on this uniform, okay? You know it, I know it. Come on, David knew it. - Yeah, that doesn't make it better. You don't know. You don't, okay, you weren't there. You didn't see it happen. You didn't hold him when he died. - You gotta let it drop, okay? That's it, you gotta let it drop or you're not gonna be able to do this job. - Let it drop, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's real easy for you to say, real easy. - Yeah, Colt, and you know what, it is easy for me to. Stop it, you know what? Don't think I haven't noticed every time, every time stuff starts hitting the fan you start wigging out. - That is not true. - Yeah, it is. You wanna know something else? You better get your head back in the game. 'Cause if not, it's gonna be me. Okay, it's gonna be me or someone else you're lying there holding dead in the street one night! - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Everything good here? - We're good, you all right? - Good! Log this, narcotics from in the house. - Sure thing, Sarge. Get out of my way. - Out of your way, out of your way, out of your way. [slow, pensive music] - [David] Oh, what a night, Colt. - [Colton] I'm over it. - [David] Me too. So how are you and Jesus, man, you all good? - [laughs] Here we go. - I'm serious, how's your faith, man, how's the walk? - It's good, it's good. - [David] That's good. - Not as good as yours, probably. - [David] Just can't imagine doing this job without some backup, man. - [Colton] Well I'm your backup, that's all you need. - I've seen you shoot. It's more of an assurance than backup. Just knowing that when I go into that call, no matter what happens, good or bad, God's in control. Anything that happens, it's all good, man. - Yeah, it's true. - We're a different breed, brother, we're a different breed. You've got all these people walking around, head in the clouds, man, just waiting. No idea what's waiting around the corner for them. Knowing those wolves are there. They're like little sheep. And the wolves are just waiting to pounce on them. We're the shepherds. Me and you, we're the shepherds here to protect the sheep. - You are getting deep on me, David. - Aye, I'm more than a pretty face, okay? - I don't know. - Speaking of pretty faces, you bringing Lauren to church Sunday? - Yeah, yeah, we'll be there. - Well good, maybe we'll go out to eat afterwards. - Yeah, you owe me. - All right, all right. That's fair, I'll buy. [sobbing] - Colt, come on, man! [pensive music] [horn honks] [horn honking] - Colton. [tense music] Colton? What... You okay? Babe, oh my god, babe! Oh, honey. [Colton sobbing] I got you. Peanut butter and jelly, right? - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. - Okay. - Hey, hey, not too far. - Yes, ma'am. - Ever think about having another one? - Mm, only everyday. I just don't want him to be an only child. Do you think you might want to have another one? - To have, I don't know, I mean, sometimes I think it's cruel to bring kids into this world. Other times I think they're the only ray of hope left in it. - Wanna talk about it? - Having another kid? - No. No, I don't want to talk about it. - Come on, Colton, what is it, is it the job? - Yes, it's the job. It's always the job. - Well, then, talk to me, I'm here for you. - Lauren, you wouldn't understand. - Well, I definitely don't understand now. I mean every time I ask, it's always just, same old. [scoffs] Come on, Colton, you need to talk to somebody. You need help. And if not to me, maybe somebody who has more experience in this area. - I am not talking to a shrink. - Okay, I'm not talking about a shrink, necessarily, maybe a pastor or that new chaplain? Anybody, honey, but you can't, you can't go on like this, you know that. When you're out on patrol and you run into something that concerns you, you call for backup, right? So just think of it as calling for backup. If you won't do it for yourself, will you at least consider doing it for me? For him? [thoughtful music] - [Gabe] Love you, dad. - I love you too, buddy. I'll call the pastor tomorrow. - About time, sunshine, I was starting to think you got lost. - I was on the phone. What's going on? We going fishing or something? - CID snagged the driver of the drive-by that killed the kid. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. And of course, he's spilling the beans on the shooter, hoping to catch a break. [dispatcher speaking faintly] - Nice guy. - Yeah, he's a real altar boy. His name is Omar Cesar. The driver's given us the details on a buy that's taking place in that parking lot down there by the river. Looks like we're gonna be the new customers for the buy. - No SWAT or street crimes on this one? - No time, the deal's about to go down. But they're getting prepped just in case. And in case the genius tries to take a swim, we got the boys from the river unit on the water, out of sight, on stand by. - There's only one way into the parking lot, so once Omar's pulled in, we've gotta move fast, before he realizes that we flipped the buyer. - Sounds like a plan. - Let's do it. - Let's get it done. - So we good? - [sighs] Yeah, we're good. - Are you, good? - I'm good. - Okay, let's go catch a scumbag. [dramatic music] - Move on target, move on target! [intense music] - 224 to headquarters, we've got a runner! He's headed toward the golf course. - I got him. - [Colton] Out of the way! River patrol, he's headed for the water. Don't move! - [Shep] End of the line, Omar! - Give me a reason, Omar. - Get on the ground. Get on the ground, now! - You can't shoot me bro, I ain't armed. - What about that kid? What was he armed with? - Say, bro, that was an accident. I wasn't even aiming for him. - Tell his mother that! - Colt. Colt! [engine whirring] - [Jacob] I got him! - Wow. - River Unit, you mind fishing my rookie out also? - [Man] Yeah, I guess we can do that, since he's right there. [both laughing] - [Shep] It's all right. - [Colton] Easy. I believe you were looking for this one. - Omar, looks like you went for a swim. - Man, this psycho almost shot me for nothing. - Stop whining, let's go, come on. - [Sarge] I got nothing. - [Shep] You got to be kidding me, man. - Can we go back to the station so I can change? - You're not getting my cop car soaking wet. See you back at HQ. - [Jacob] What am I supposed to do, walk? It's over a mile away. Is he serious? - Well, there's a bright side rook, maybe you'll be dry by the time you get there. [gentle music] Well, you outdid yourself. This thing is littered with spell check. - [Shep] I checked on that, we can get rid of that. - [Colton] Unbelievable. - Oh, hey. [everyone whistling, clapping] - Hey, rookie? You know it'd be better if you take the uniform off before you wash it, right? [men laughing] - [Captain] Seriously, though, congratulations. - For what? - The River Unit called, they said you passed your swimming test. [men laughing] - All right, all right. Rook, go get changed, we've got reports to finish. - Way to go rook! - All right! - Three more weeks! Three more weeks, Wiggy. - What I'd miss, why's he all wet? - Don't ask. - Ah, I actually like that guy. [gentle music] - All I'm saying is one. Just one text. - I just can't guarantee you'll get the number though. - Either one of them, man. - I'm holding out. - You lay the foundation and I'll finish it, all right? [men laughing] - You guys are a riot. - Aren't we though? Aren't we? - Three weeks. - [Colton] That's good rook, stay right there. - I like you. - One, two three, aw, yeah. Yep. 2-2-4 is 10-8. - [Dispatcher] 2-2-4, step back inside. You have someone here at the desk waiting. - 10-4, headed back in. - Deputy Miller, so glad to see you again! - Pastor Roberts. - Please, call me Michael. - As long as you call me Colton. - Deal. Can't tell you how glad I am you reached out. - I gotta be honest, I didn't expect to see you here. I thought that maybe we'd meet at your office. - Actually we're meeting at yours. I'm riding with you tonight. - Oh. - Yeah, your Captain set it up. Plus, I've always wanted to ride in a cop car. - [scoffs] Okay, uh, that sounds great. I'll show you around, come on. - [Colton] So these are just some of the offices down here. [twangy country music] - Got him. - Oh, good one. Yeah, that was a good one. 20 bucks if you get him in the head. - Ooh. - [Daryl] Ah. - Well, go get'm. - Mm-mmm. Uh, your turn. Remember I got 'em last time. - No. No, you didn't get them last time you idiot. - Don't call me an idiot, Larry. I got 'em last time. - I'll call you whatever I good well please, this is my house. Now get the darts, Daryl! - The old my house thing, again, right? Everything's a fight to you. [Larry laughing] Really? You're going to hit me in the butt. - I need another beer, man. - Well, hold on, let me open up the washing machine. Three in a row, you get 20 bucks, man. - I got it. This is the one for you, little buddy. [Daryl laughs] I'm gonna kill you for that. - [Daryl] Ow! [grunts] You're spillin' my beer. Get off me. Get off, Larry. Get off me! - Yeah, my stupid husband is fighting with his stupid brother. Yeah, that's right, 911! - [Daryl] I'll kill you Larry. - Get here as fast as you can, please. Get here, this is an emergency. - So how long you been a cop, Colton? - Seven years. How long you been a pastor? - Oh, about seven months. - Really? - Yeah, but I've been in the business 15 years. This is my first gig as the lead pastor, though. - Yeah, you likin' it? - You know, I'm still trying to fill the pews, unfortunately. But, yeah, I like it. How 'bout you, you like your job? - Used to. Not so sure nowadays. - Not as exciting as it used to be? - Well, it's plenty exciting, that's the problem. Some days I think, I might be better off mowing the lawn or painting a house. You know, anything that doesn't involve people bleeding or crying or both. - That's understandable. Man, can't be easy seeing the things you do, day after day. - No one calls 911 when they're having a good day, that's for sure. - I guess your job and mine have a lot in common. We're both there for the worse of people's lives. So what keeps you going? - Several things, I guess. First, just the thought that God wouldn't have me here if he didn't think I could handle it. Secondly, I just can't stand the thought of somebody needing saving and me not being there when they do. But I imagine that's also something else you and I have in common. - [Dispatcher] 2-18 copy a disturbance, 150 Rosewood Street. - You gonna respond to that? - 2-1-8, 10-4. - What are you mad or something? - No, I'm not mad. - Well, why are you so mopey? - My underwear is still wet. [laughing] - Oh, you're all right, you're all right. [Larry coughing] - Hey, Daryl. - Hit me in the back with a friggin' dart! - I still got it, brother. - I'm bleeding. [Larry sighs] You know, I'm bleeding. - [Michael] Something wrong? - If I had a dollar for every time I dealt with these three, I could retire early. - Guess I've gotta stay in there? - That's the rule. - Hey, don't you say nothing, I ain't going back to jail. - Great. [Larry groans] Here we go again. - Hey, let's let the rookie handle this one. - Anything I should know? - Look it here, got a new fish. Pick you up at the day care? - Sir, we received a call from this residence about a disturbance. - Nah, ain't no disturbance here. - Why don't you just tell me what's going on and we'll get to the bottom of-- - There ain't nothing going on. Me and my brother's just having a little fun playing darts, wrestling around, ain't no law against that is there? - [Jacob] Stay here. - Sure thing, Lieutenant. - The Chaplain in the car? - Oh, yeah. - You're not gonna get all religious on me are you? - It's just a ride along. - Oh, is that what they call it? - That is what they call it. - Okay. - Anything going here, sir? - Ah, nothing going on. Well I mean there's, no. - Did anything happen here, today? - It's all good, all good in the hood. - All right let's go bail him out. - Yep. - Larry? Why are we here? - 'Cause that fool woman called you. And she ain't going quit calling you till she gets me thrown in jail for something. - Okay. What're you doing to Daryl? You picking on him again? [pounding on door] - Denise! Come out, let's talk. - He going to jail this time? - What for, Denise? - He and his stupid brother was fighting. - Brother said nothing happened. - Well, that's a lie, take him to jail. - [Colton] Denise, you are all drunk. - I gotta stay drunk to be married to that fool. - Okay, did anything physical happen? [laughs] - Ain't nothing physical happen with that man, never. - In 15 years, right? - Mm-hmm. May as well be in jail, gave me no babies! - Okay. - 'Cause I was like, watching up at late night. He took that thing, wah-pow! Right through a melon and a beer can. I had to buy that thing. - I would, too. - Yeah. - That's great, hey, guys, guess what? Larry just bought a new ninja sword. - It's awesome. - Is that right? - Anything? - No, nothing. - Larry, please don't make me come out here again. - I'm telling you, it ain't me, it's that fool woman. - Okay. - Yep. Bye, Larry. - Well, you boys be careful. Lot of crazies out there, so be sure and write now. - Why, you can't read. - That ain't funny. - 2-2-4 headquarters, myself and 2-18 are 10-8. No report. - [Dispatcher] 10-4, 10-8, no report. - [Michael] It's sad people choose to live this way. There's definitely something missing in their lives. - 1995. - Intelligence. - Actually, I was thinking more like love, hope, Jesus. - [Colton] Pretty sure Jesus would not be welcomed here, Pastor. - [Michael] Have you ever asked them? - That's more your line of work. - Actually, that's all our line of work. Theologically speaking. You been saved Colton? - Years ago. I guess it took. Good, then you understand. Jesus didn't just die for the good ones. He died for the bad ones, too. Even those we may not particularly care for. They may just be the ones who need him the most. - Ready? - Yeah. - What about that one? That one looks like an old beater. - Come on, you gonna go pull over some blue hair, Betty Crocker type? - Well. - No. There. That's a good one. So what's the PC for the stop? - Uh... - Better hurry, if he saw us he's gonna pull over and park real quick. - Uh... - His mirror's busted! Come on let's go, light 'em up. - Sorry, that was an accident. - You do that again, I'm handcuffing you to the light bar. And he just pulled off, he pulled off. - Well how was I supposed to know? - Stop. - I couldn't even see-- You're supposed-- - [Dispatcher] 2-18, copy a suspicious person. - 2-1-8, 10-4. - How did you get through the Academy? Really? - [Michael] Got a family, Colt? - Yeah, I got a wife, son, nine years old. - [Dispatcher] 2-2-4, check with 2-18 and copy detail. - Here we go. - [Michael] Blessed are the peacemakers. - Some days I wonder. 2-2-4, go ahead. - [Dispatcher] 500 block Wanze Street. White male acting erratic, possibly CDS. - 2-2-4, copy. 2-2-4, Headquarters, I'm 10-97. I'll be out with him. - What're gonna do? - I don't know. Make sure he's not a danger to himself or anyone else. - [Michael] I'll be in here praying. - [Colton] How we doing tonight, sir? Easy. - Get away from me! - [Colton] Easy, settle down. Is this your residence? - You're the spawn of Satan! - That's new. - Leave me alone, demon! - What is your name? What is your name? - Satan is coming! - Shep, step it up! - Satan is coming! - This one's going crazy. Yeah, listen-- - Leave me alone! - Sir, easy, easy. Do not move, okay? Listen to me, I'm here to help you. I promise. Breathe, what is your name? - Get away from me! - Easy. - [Man] No! - Down, sir. - Satan is coming! [intense music] Satan is coming! [man groaning and yelling] No! No! No! [man yelling] You won't take me! No, oh, no, no, no, no! [man crying] - [Shep] There's no demons in there, buddy, no demons. Just some spiders, watch out for that. [man screaming] - What was that about? - It's called meth. Don't try it. - Did you check the house? - Yeah, let's see if anyone knows this guy. [man screaming] - Demon! [screams] [intense music] - What ya got? - Oh, surprise, more meth heads. All right, Col, go ahead and knock. [knocking on door] - [Colton] Sheriff's Office, open up. - Three, two, one. There they go. - [Colton] Sheriff's Office! - Col, I've got a girl not moving. She's unresponsive, go, go, go! [Colton] All right. - [Shep] We clear? - All right. She's unresponsive, grab your CPR mask. - It's in the car. - Come on! Come on, come on. - How we looking? - [Colton] Not good. Flip her over. Come on! [girl retching] There it is. - There we go. - There we go. - Easy, easy. - Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, welcome back, princess. - [Jacob] She's alive! - We've got you. - [Jacob] We saved her. - Breathe. - Yeah, we did. I'll make sure medical's coming. - Yeah. - Stay with her. - This happens every night? - Just about. She gonna make it? - Thanks to you, she'll live to see another day. - [Colton] Thank you. - You guys have a good night. - Come on, I want to show you something. Methamphetamine. It's pure evil. Destroys everything it touches. And people want more. God allows it to exist. Think Jesus is welcomed here? - I know seven years of seeing things like this everyday; I get why you called. But you can't let the darkness overtake you. You have to be the light. - Pretty sure my light went out awhile ago. - You just saved a girl back there. - I answered a call, same as anyone else would have. - I don't know that I would have. Takes someone special to answer a call like that. - I don't think so. 'Cause that same girl will be doing the exact same thing next week. - Possibly. But I think God used you to give her a second chance. - Why does she deserve that? My best friend, he didn't get a second chance. Got shot, killed, guy that shot him got away. That fair? - If you look at it from an earthly perspective, no. It's not fair. This is a fallen world. Filled with sin and problems. We're all gonna die one day. There's no getting around that. God's work is eternal. From that perspective, what's a few years of unpleasantness, compared to a lifetime of joy? I wonder how many people has God put in your path who don't know Jesus? How many people who don't know hope because no one's ever told them? You're the one they call when they need help. You're the one God's called to be a shepherd. To watch over his sheep. You'll never be able stop all the bad things from happening. The Bible says it rains on the just and the unjust. But you can be a light in the darkness. - You are giving me way too much credit, Pastor. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - When someone broke into my house, held a gun to my wife's head, who did God send? Never forget, you have a choice. You can either let the darkness overtake you, or you can be a bearer of the light. - I almost killed a man yesterday. [forlorn music] He shot this little kid during a drive by. I had my gun pointed at him, I could have pulled the trigger. No questions asked. I just kept thinking that this guy killed this little boy over something as stupid as drugs. I wanted to make him pay for it. - But you didn't. - I wanted to. - There's no sin in wanting justice, Colton. But consider this, what if that man died without knowing Christ? Your job is tough, man. You're put into situations that would make the rest of us run away screaming. But God's chosen you because he knows you can handle it. You've been called to be a light. Remember what the Bible says, the harvest is plenteous but the laborers, they're few. God needs you to do his service. It's noble that you'd run in a burning building and rescue someone's life. But what good does it do if you rescue their life, forget about their soul? What good is it if you rescue them from that fire and yet they're gonna spend eternity in flames? Can I pray with you? Lord, I pray that you be with Colton, right now. God help him to find the faith that he once knew. Or help him to realize that you've given him a calling. Lord, I pray that you would help him to follow that calling. Lord, I pray that you would help him take a stand for you. To realize that you've got a greater purpose for him. Lord, I pray that you would help him to realize that we've got to reach people. People right where they're at. [Lauren moans] - Hey. Everything okay? - Yeah. Yeah, everything's great. [rousing music] - Let's go, come on, one more rep. Come on my grandmother can do this and she's dead Col! Get it up, hey, there it is! Right on, rack it! - I liked your grandma. - So did I. - You know I got a couple more than you. - Congratulations. How about next time when a bad guy crawls on top of you and lie real still you just bench press him off. - Shut up. - That'd be easy, right? - Get on the bag, I'm gonna do it. - All right, show me. All right, let's see it. - See, this is how you handle the bad guys. - [Colton] There it is. - Hey, you ain't going soft are you? - No, I'm not going soft. What makes you say that? - I saw you the other night hanging the head with that pastor. What am I supposed to think? - Yeah. I was just trying to get some things right in my head. That's all. - Are they right? - I'm getting there for the first time in a while, yeah. - Oh, good. Hey, man, it's cool if you, like, found Jesus and all that. More power to you. I just want to know, uh, I just want to know if I can count on you to get my back, is all. - What are you talking about? Of course you can count on me, come on. - Okay, all right. - You know, Lauren and I did check out his church, Sunday, though. Wasn't bad, actually. You should come with us next time. - Forget it. - Just saying it might be cool, you know, for all of us to go. - Stop it. God and I have an agreement. I stay out of his way, he stays out of mine, it works. - There it is, nice. - You already leaving? - Yeah, I promised Gabe I'd hang before shift. - [scoffs] Oh my gosh, family! - It's a bummer, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. - Hey, promise me something. What's that? - Promise me you'll come to church with us. Once, man, it's not gonna kill you. - [Shep] Once, I'll do once for you. - You'll do one? - Yeah. - He'll do one! - For you. - See you tonight. - See you. [Colton sighs] - Okay, I'm out of here. - I don't want you to go to work, dad. - I know, buddy. I gotta help those that need it, okay? I'll be back. - Why don't you just call in sick tonight. - Oh, you think they'd believe me? - Yeah. You'd pull it off. - I love you. - I love you too. - Okay. - Get out of here. - All right, I'm out. - Dad, wait, policeman's prayers. - Oh, how could I forget? - Of course. - Okay. [rousing music] Lord, I ask for courage. Courage to face and conquer my own fears. Courage to take me where others will not go. I ask for strength. Strength of body to protect others. Strength of spirit to lead others. I ask for dedication. Dedication to my job to do it well. Dedication to my community to keep it safe. Give me, Lord, concern for all those who trust me. And compassion for those who need me. And please, Lord, through it all, be at my side. Amen. [Daryl snoring] [can clatters] [Daryl gasps] - Well, Larry, I'm going to bed. [Daryl groans] [Larry sighs] - Larry I have told you to stop using my bathroom. You stink it up! You are-- You're worthless. You're supposed to sell it, not use it! - Hey! Go back in the house, Denise, before I kill you. - I have had it with you, I am calling the cops. And this time you are going to jail. I will be so glad to get rid of your worthless, no good-- [thuds] [Denise groans] - That's the last time you call the law on me, woman. The last time! - [Dispatcher] 911, where's your emergency? Hello? 911, where's your emergency? Hello? [thunder rumbling] Hello, anyone there? - I look over, Shep judo chops this guy, right? He hits the pavement, I thought he was dead. I mean, I thought he killed him. - I know, he resisted. - Resisted, what'd he sneeze? - No, it's the soft-handed technique, Sarge. It's not my fault the pavement was hard. - Yeah, what about the big dent on the front of your hood? Same story? - No, he tripped. - Well there she is. I was about to call search and rescue. - Why, you look like you're just about to float away. All right, club with fries, a grilled chicken salad. - Aw, the fat guy orders the salad. Hey, hey, endoscopy, colonoscopy, cholesterol, high glycerides, low glycerides. [sniffs food] Keep it up big boy, your day's coming. - Well, where'd our cheeseburger go? He didn't get called out did he? - He's probably in the bathroom mirror practicing his Dirty Harry pose. - Does sound like him. - All right, well, let me know if you boys need anything else. - Thank you, dear. - Ah, that's a mistake. - Oh, boy. This is what happens. - This didn't go well last time. - No, it didn't. - Shep, you ain't right! You ain't right! - I'm not. - [Dispatcher] 2-0-6 copy a suspicious person in Mill Haven Estates. - Where was that? - That was on four, they gave it to six. - 2-0-6 is en route. - Sounds busy. I was hoping for a slow night. - You just had to go and say the S word. - Come on, Sarge. - I know, I know. Everything come out all right, sunshine? - [Shep] Did you remember to wash your hands, young man? - Of course. [spits] [men laughing] Oh! Really? - [Shep] Hey, wash it down, wash it down. - Here, rook, drink some water. Drink some water. - The best. - Down the hatch, good boy. That better? - [Dispatcher] 2-2-4 copy a 911 hang up. - Never fails. 2-2-4, go ahead. - 911, hang up, 150 Rosewood Street. No voice and no answer on call back. - Denise and Larry at it again. 2-2-4 and 2-2-8 en route. - [Dispatcher] 10-4. - Well, you can have my steak, Sarge. Just make sure you finish your salad, first. - Come to papa. - Oh, that doesn't look good. - Hope it doesn't rain. - Really? R word, R word, S word. - See you guys later. [thunder rumbling] - Stupid woman. [thunder cracks] [phone buzzes] - Hey, baby, nice photo. - [laughs] I thought you might like that. I just wanted to call and say I love you before we go to bed. - I love you. I'm headed out on a call, but tomorrow I was thinking date night, you and me. Maybe we can catch a movie or something. - Uh, if you're talking about something not animated for a change, you are definitely on. - Exactly. Well, I love you, have a good night, okay? - Okay, hey, hey. Hold on, Gabe wants to say goodnight. It's dad. - Goodnight, dad, I love you. - I love you, buddy. Sleep well, okay? - I will. - All right, I'm gonna get him to bed. I'll see you soon, I love you babe. - Okay, I love you. I'll be home soon. - Goodnight. - Bye. 2-2-4, headquarters, any luck on getting ahold of that caller? - [Dispatcher] Negative, 2-2-4, we're trying again. [dramatic music] - It's my steak dinner, somebody's taking a ride. - [Jacob] You know, I think I'm finally starting to figure this guy out. Just an annoying, harmless drunk. - [Shep] How drunk do you gotta to be. - She has a pulse. 2-2-4, headquarters, roll medical to our location. Possible aggravated battery, victim's unconscious. I'll stay with her. Keep your eyes peeled. - Yep, he made it easy for us this time. - So much for harmless. - [Man on radio] 2-0-6 will be heading that way also. - Want me to go ahead and knock, or? No, no. [Larry screaming] [gun firing] - Shots fired, shots fired!! - Jake, you got eyes? - I've been shot. - 2-18, Headquarters, shots fired, no eyes on shooter! I repeat, no eyes on shooter! - Came from the camper, Shep! - [Colton] Jake's been hit! - Jake, Jake, you all right? - I don't have eyes! 2-2-4, headquarters, officer down, officer down. He's got to be in the camper. Jake, crawl to me! - I can't breathe! I think I'm gonna die. - You're not gonna die. Crawl to me now! - I can't feel my leg. [gun fires] - [exclaims] Golly! - 2-2-4, headquarters, be advised armed suspect barricaded inside the camper. - [Dispatcher] 10-4, 2-80 is activating SWAT. - Larry! Larry, stop shooting! - I can't get around the camper, I don't have shot. You have a shot? - Don't have it. - What are we gonna do? - Shut up! - Larry, stop this and come out unarmed! - I wasn't going back then, and I ain't going back now! You's gonna shoot me! - God, I'm going to kill him. [Jacob groaning] - Let's get him out, okay? Larry, is Daryl in there? - [Daryl] Yeah, I'm in here. - Just shut up and sit back Daryl. - [Daryl] I'm in here! - [Colton] Daryl, come out! - Big brother's gonna take care of this. - [Daryl] You're gonna get us killed, Larry. - Larry, you don't have to die tonight, come on. - Well I ain't going back to jail. - Larry, this is not worth it. You've shot one cop, all right? Let's end this. - Ain't the first cop I shot. That's right, you were there. - Col, is he talking about David? [dramatic music] - [David] Driver, step out of the car for me. - Hey, you seeing this? - No, no, Colt, I'm not seeing that. I'm seeing we got 45 minutes left on shift. My paperwork's done, my evidence is logged. And I see you really don't care. - I don't. - You wanna go after that. - Let's get 'em. - All right. Well, you're gettin' the runner. - No, I pulled something, man, I think it's like my hammy. - It's your stop, you get the runner, rookie. - We'll see. [sirens blipping] - It's the cops, man. - [Larry] I ain't going back to jail, boys. - [Colton] Excuse me, sir. Stop! Stop where you are. - [David] Driver, step out of the car for me. Gun! [gun fires] [gun firing] [tires screeching] - Larry, I do not want to kill you. Come outside right now. - Hold on, don't shoot, I'm comin' out! I'm coming out, I'm unarmed! - Come to me, get on the ground, now! On the ground now, crawl to me! Get on the ground, move! - Larry, come outside right now! Be smart like Daryl here, come on out! - [Shep] Get down right now! - All right! You win! Here I come boys. - Drop the gun, Larry. Larry, drop the gun. - Oh, you coming' with me? - Larry don't do it. Don't, don't do it! [gun fires] [Larry groans] Get down, get down, get down. - Oh, God, please move, give him space, give him space. Colt, you all right, man? [sirens approaching] This is bad, this is bad. Hold on, hold on. No, it's fine, man, you got this. Cavalry's on the way, okay? Cavalry's on the way. Come on, we have an officer down over here! We're over here! No, Colt, stay with me, come on. No, no, no, stay with me! Colt, you stay with me! Don't you leave, come on! Come on, get over here, guys! Come on, come on, stay with me. Stay with me, come on. Breathe, breathe, man. [solemn music] Colt, Colt! Someone get in there! Guys, come on! Come on, Colt. - Hey, I'm the chaplain. Somebody called me about a deputy being shot. - You're doing good buddy, hang in there. Come on buddy. - Wait, wait, wait. We're almost there. - Colt, Colt! - [Colton] Talk to Larry. - What are we doing, come on! - Talk to Larry? - Get him in there. - What about Larry? - You get back, come on! Get him in there, come on Colt! Stay with me, stay with me! Stay with me! Come on, come on. - [Gabe] Hurry, mom! - Hi, hi, my husband Colton Miller, was brought in. - Lauren, Lauren. - Where's my dad? - He's uh-- - Is he okay? I mean, can we see him? - Yeah, he'll be fine, he's gonna be fine. [gentle music] [machine whooshing] [ECG beeping] - Morning, Pastor. - Any changes? - Nah, nothing, yet. You would know he would wake up. If this guy makes it and Colton doesn't, I might go in here and finish him off myself. - May I speak with him? - I'm sorry, Pastor, we're not letting anybody in right now. He's got a slew of charges. - Please, it's important. Colton asked me to. - Colton? - Before he went into surgery. - [sighs] I don't know, Pastor. - It was Colton's request. - All right, but just for a few minutes. - You ain't no doctor. - No, I'm a Pastor. - Well you're just wasting your time here then. - Colton didn't seem to think so. - Who's Colton? - The deputy you shot. The one lying a few doors down. His name's Colton. - I just knew him as boss. Is he gonna make it? - At this point, only God knows that. - How 'bout the other one, the new guy? - He's got a few cracked ribs, some bruises. But he's gonna live. The doctors sent him home. - Well, I wish the other one, Colton? Hadn't jumped in the way like that. He was just supposed to shoot me. - Why'd you want him to shoot you? - 'Cause I couldn't do it myself. I figured if I-- [groans] What am I sayin'? I was high. He was just supposed to shoot me, so I could end this miserable life. - But he didn't. - Well, the new guy sure did. I guess Colton's just too scared. - No, that's where you're wrong. In that moment Colton was fearless. He did what he did because he cares about you. [Larry scoffs] - I don't think so, nobody cares about me. - When they were wheeling him into surgery, Colton said to make sure that hell didn't get you. Told me to tell you that Jesus loves you, Denise, too. - Now why would he say something like that? - Colton's a man of faith. I honestly can't explain why he did what he did. I know it wasn't in his own power. At that moment, he was most certainly moved by Jesus. He could have shot you. And by God's standards, he would have been justified. At least in my interpretation. - Well, he should have. I shot that deputy. Killed his friend. - And in return, he saved your life. Why'd you want to die Larry. - Been worthless my whole life, Pastor. Just a worthless toke. - No one's worthless, Larry. - Well, I am, I ain't nothing. Been drug using, cop killin', alcoholic. I ain't nothin'. [gentle music] - Some people might say so. But Colton looked beyond that. So does Jesus. So do I. You've certainly made mistakes. There's no stain that the blood of Christ can't wash away. Right now, you can be made brand new. - Pastor. I'm going to jail. The only new beginning for me is a life sentence. - You're right. You've done some horrible things. You're gonna be held accountable. The apostle Paul was jailed. God used him to do some wonderful things while he was there. You're going to a place where's there's hundreds of people that don't know the love of Jesus. God can use you while you're there. If you'll let him. - I'm no preacher. I'm no preacher. - But you can be made brand new. You can experience the love, the forgiveness, the compassion that Jesus wants you to know. The same love and forgiveness and compassion that Colton showed you and risked his own life for. Life's about second chances and Colton showed you great mercy and compassion so that you could experience that second chance. Larry, don't you want to be made brand new? - I do. - Heavenly Father. God, I'm so thankful that you care about each and everyone of us. Lord, that no matter what our past, you're willing to forgive us if we'll just ask. God, I pray right now for Larry. [forlorn music] [machine beeping] - [Shep] Hey. - [Lauren] I'm really glad you're here. - [Gabe] Hey. - Yeah. - See ya. - Yeah, I'll be in there. - Good morning, brother. - Morning, Pastor. - I'll make it. - [Sarge] Pastor. - [Gabe] Hey, Michael. - [Michael] Hey, Gabe. - Thank you so much for everything. - [Gabe] Thank you. - Colton was such a special man. - And a dad. - Yes, he was. Praying for you guys. - Thanks, see you in there. - Okay. I'm truly sorry about Colton. - Colton was a great man. - Yes, he was. - Guess you didn't pray hard enough for him, huh? I'm sorry. I forgot. You were too busy praying over the dirt bag who killed him. - I understand your frustrations. - Do you? I lost two friends in one year to that same piece of trash you were so concerned about in that hospital room. They're always talking about Jesus this and God that, so where was he, Pastor? His radio must not have been on 'cause he sure didn't show up to save either one of 'em. - He did save 'em, just not in the way you wanted. - God works in mysterious ways, huh? This may come as a shock to you, Pastor. I'm not here for you. I'm here to fulfill a promise that I made to one of those friends. [solemn music] - Good morning. Thank you for coming to church today. I had a message prepared, but I can't get Colton off my mind. A few months ago, I came home to the worst situation a man can come home to. There were police cars in my driveway. A criminal had broken into my house and taken my wife hostage. An officer approached me, placed his hand on my shoulder and said, trust us. Not an easy thing to do. Those officers managed to rescue my wife from harm. I marvel how these men could be so brave in the face of such danger. Later, I met that young officer who placed his hand on my shoulder. His name was Deputy Colton Miller. I learned that Colton had some demons, as we all do. His faith had been shaken. You see his friend and fellow officer had been killed. Shot in the line of duty. He wondered how a God could allow something like that to happen. Now we're gathered here again today, wondering the same thing. I was there when they wheeled him into surgery. Just before they took him back he asked me to express his love for his family. He also asked me to express his love for his fellow man. He even asked me to tell the guy who shot him that Jesus loves him. Jesus was asked what the greatest commandment was. He said, to love the Lord God with all your heart. And the second was like it, to love your neighbor as yourself. Colton not only believed that. But his last step was to prove that. I later met the man who shot Colton in the intensive care unit. I told him what Colton had asked me to share with him. I watched as this criminal, this murderer, asked the Lord to forgive him of his sins. Some of you may be bitter today. But I recall what Jesus said: "I am the good shepherd. "And the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep." That's exactly what Colton did. And as I watched Colton's life, as he became a man of faith, a man, that was filled with fearless faith, as he trusted God and he proved that he was willing to do what others would not do. Jesus said, "don't fear them that can kill the body, "but can't kill the soul. "But rather fear him who can destroy "both the soul and body in hell." There are several police officers here today. No doubt you've heard the verse, "Yea, though I walk "through the valley of the shadow of death, "I will fear no evil." But I wonder how many of you have that kind of fearless faith? I wonder how many of you can go to that next call, that next briefing, and that next bad situation, knowing if things don't turn out well, that Jesus has laid claim to your soul. If you don't, I urge you to. So would Colton. Lord God, I pray for your mercy and compassion upon us. Lord, help us to have a faith that Colton had. Help us to have that fearless faith. Please bring comfort. Our hearts are grieving but we're trusting you. In Jesus' name. Amen. - Nice speech. - It's not what I had planned. Sometimes, God changes our plans. - Did Colton really say all that? - He did. He said it. He believed it. Colton didn't want anyone to perish, even his enemies. But especially his friends. Would you like me to pray with you? ♪ You're no longer a slave - [Michael] Dear Heavenly Father. Thank you for the life of Colton. Thank you for his fearless faith. I pray that you would help us have that kind of faith.
