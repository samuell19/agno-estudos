[FOOTBALL CROWD CHEERS] COMMENTATOR: One or two of the youngsters on The Kop will have had to hear all about it from their fathers and grandfathers, the good old days. Well, they're back. TOMMY: In the streets where I live, football is like a religion. The managers are gods, the players the disciples, and the European Cup, the holy grail. What about the followers? What about their sacrifices and their dreams? What about the twelfth man? [FOOTBALL CROWD CHEERS] COMMENTATOR: The time has come for Liverpool to play in yet another European Cup final. Rome, Wembley, Paris, and now Istanbul, May 25th, it's a date. [CLINKS] ♪ Hey, Mr Dreamseller, where have you been? ♪ ♪ Tell me have you dreams I can see? ♪ Come here! Hey.

We can dream, we can dream. Come on, our Jamie's coming today. GERRY: To the match, your Jamie? He never comes. TOMMY: He said he would, he promised. ♪ I promise I'll be there... Jamie? Jamie? ♪ ...to share... ♪ Jamie? Come here, lad. What about the match? [CROWD CHATTERS] [EXHALES] What is it with that kid? First Kelly to miss home games like this. He should be busking for money for Istanbul. More chance of finding Gerry Adams in a Rangers kit. GERRY: Come on, let's get in. TOMMY: Hang on, lads, my scarf. Thanks, mate. Come and get your programme. Five pounds for your programme. Get your programme. Programme, programme. Come and get your programme. Gerry, I saw this old fella. He looked just like my granddad. Shush, Tommy, the team's coming on. [WILD CHEERING] [ALL CHANT] We love you, Liverpool, we do! We love you, Liverpool, we do! TOMMY: When I was a kid, he was choir master to The Kop. He taught me that when the chips are down, you sing your heart out. [ALL CHANT] Liverpool, Liverpool, Liverpool! Our Jamie thinks I'm a muppet. [SIGHS] I failed him cos I never made it as a musician. I mean, I was never even really that good. -It's true. -True. -True. -True. J! -Sorry, Dad, I've been rehearsing. -I've got a gig. -Gig? That's great. Your music's really taking off for you. Yeah, it's going good. I'll catch you later, yeah? -MAN: Give us a song, Tommy. -Yeah, yeah, save it for Istanbul. -MAN: Bring your earplugs, lads. -[MEN LAUGH] Istanbul? -I mean I'd love to go. -Would you? Yeah, the Bosphorus, the Blue Mosque, home of the Ottoman Empire. The birthplace of the kebab. -Are you two going? -Yeah. Yeah, we're going. Of course we're going. -Are we? -Yes, we are. Your Joe will be made up. Yeah, I think he will, yeah. So, er, do you wanna come, Jamie? What, for real? Are you really going? Yeah. That'd be great, yeah. Great. Look, I'll get the beers in, you get the table, tell me everything you know about Istanbul. Lads? He's coming. What the hell are you playing at? I've got a genius plan. Genius plan? -Where do you get money from? -Cashpoint? -When you haven't got any. -Rob a bank? -Good idea, but no. -What then? Tony "The Bomb" Fitz. -Tony the loan shark? -Correct. Who kills people if they don't pay up? -Bingo. -Who me and you -still owe money to? -That's the fella. -What's genius about that? -Element of surprise. He'd never be expecting us to ask for more. You'd have to be a right numpty to do that. Oh. -Istanbul here we come. -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whatever you do, don't mention Istanbul. He hates football. He'll have our cabs. My lips are sealed, Tommy. Look who is it. Tom and bleedin' Gerry. Cut to the chase. Yous two owe me money - and now you're begging for more. Tony, come on, it's only two weeks, just so we can get to Istanbul. Did you just... Did he just say Istanbul? -I don't think he did. -I think he did. -I don't think he did. -I think he did. -Did you just say Istanbul? -I don't think I did. He doesn't think he did. Get outside! I told you not to mention Istanbul. -I know. -"My lips are sealed." Get out. [CAR HORN] -Oi! -He's coming, he's coming. No more Istanbul, no phoney excuses, no part-payments, and no treating me like John Gotti's blow-up doll. Like Tony Soprano. [GUITAR STRINGS TWANG] You've got two weeks, tops, or them cabs are mine. Comprende?Eh? It's the end of the road, Tommy. And we're taxi drivers, so what do we do? -Have another brew? -No. We make a U-turn and we sell Tony the devil's trinkets. No way. They stay hidden. We're gonna get arrested. That's a chance we have to take. Look, we owe our sons. Tony is not gonna take 'em off us, is he? True. But he might take 'em off my Carmella. GERRY: But can you trust her? TOMMY: With three ex-wives who all left me for footballers, no. -Hi, Carmella. -Hiya, Robbie. -Got a football for you. -Thanks. -For charity. -I appreciate it. -The kids will be made up. -Good. -Wanna come in for a coffee? -I'd love to but, -I've heard what you're like. -Don't be silly, you're a flirt. -I'd better go. -Give us a kiss. See you later. -See you later. -OK. I'll see you later, bye. -See you later. -Bye. -Don't be a stranger. -Any time. OK. Bye. GERRY: So our lives are in the hands of Carmella? More importantly, she's our last chance to get to Istanbul. [CAR ENGINE RATTLES] Alright, Rushie, alright, Dixie? Tommy, why don't you ever call us our real names? Like Dixie Dean and Ian Rush, you'll be famous footballers one day. All they ever talk about round here is you. I'd love to be thatfamous. Me? What do they all talk about, like? About players shagging your missus. [CHILDREN GIGGLE] Tommy, come on, I'm gonna be late. Tony's short-staffed. He said he needs a barmaid with experience. I'll bet he does. [BLOWS] Buried treasure. The real McCoy. The devil's trinkets. Which makes you, my love, the perfect girl to sell them. [SALSA MUSIC PLAYING] That birthmark on your arse, it looks like Spain. Tommy says it reminds him of Xabi Alonso. All it reminds me of is where we'll live when I've got enough dough. Do you wanna make some real money? Sell these. -What are they? -Hitler's cufflinks. -Hitler's cufflinks? -Hitler's bleedin' cufflinks. [PULLS HANDBRAKE] TONY: Hurry up, will ya? No, no, no, no, no.

Well, go on then, how much? -Thirty K. -Ohh, you're joking? -No, I'm not. -[LAUGHS] And, he's got a buyer -in Istanbul. -Oh, right. Yeah, so we'll use Dumb and Dumberas a courier service to lever a small fortune for myself and... Me? Correct, Carmella, correct. Puerto Banus here we come. I just love my life. Unlucky in love times four. GRANDDAD: Don't worry, Tommy, look to the fives, lad, look to the fives. If you ever lose your faith, look for me and I'll be there. [STARTS ENGINE] [BIRD CALLS] TONY: So my two clowns will bring the cufflinks, just give them the tickets in exchange, but listen to me, Altan. Take no baloney from Tommy. He can be really cheeky. Hmm. To pay them a pittance for treasure worth 300K plus, that is Jennifer Lopez's bum cheeky. I'll have the tickets ready. Tell them to look for a very handsome Alan Hansen. I'll be wearing a fez in honor of our time in a Frankfurt jail. The less said about a Frankfurt jail, the better. You just make sure you tell the buyer to be ready with the money. ALTAN: That's not how it works. The buyer won't get his hands dirty. A pair of psychopaths owe him a big favor. They're getting the money. Who knows where it comes from. Naughty boys. -Are you sure about this, Altan? -Don't worry Tony, they're pros. [POLICE SIREN ON] [SHOUT IN TURKISH] -So where are they, Altan? -[LAUGHS] Who can say? Held up somewhere. [SPEAK IN TURKISH] So you call me as soon as the deal goes through. Your wish is my command, boss. I'll always remember our saying that. "There's only one Tony who fits." I told you not to mention that. We'll talk later. [BEEPS] Mwah. [CLICK] [DISTANT SIRENS] 100 percent the Fuhrer's. Lay it on me. How did a pair of plant pots like you two -get hold of these? -I'd rather not, Tony. Loose lips sink ships and all that. That's correct, Thomas. How come you know so much about the Fuhrer? Well, Gerald, I've studied all the wise leaders, me. -TOMMY: Oh, yeah? Like who? -Al Capone, Hitler, Mussolini, Carlo Gambino. -Who? -I'll tell you later. On the morning of the game, give the cufflinks to my contact -and he'll give you two tickets. -Two? -I thought we agreed four? -Our sons. Hang on a minute, what do you think I am, a bleedin' charity? Have a look in the envelopes. -Ah, it's £500 in each. -Spends, a generous offer, I'm sure you'll agree. Knock yourselves out. [TURKISH TRADITIONAL MUSIC] TOMMY: One night in Istanbul, lads.
