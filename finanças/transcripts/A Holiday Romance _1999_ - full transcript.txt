We've been driving for four and a half hours, and you have not said one word. I don't wanna be here. Duly noted. You had no choice. Bethlehem, Kentucky. Just remember it's temporary. (voices vocalizing) ♪ Walking in a winter wonderland ♪ I thought you were gonna get outta the hatchet business? I am. Got a desperate situation here. They close the school, they're gonna be busing kids 40 minutes every day. And I've been promised a teaching position when this is over anywhere I want. I don't understand why we had to leave now. I just wanted to torture you. You did. We could have waited until after Christmas. I gotta rework the budget by the first of the year. They need a report in two weeks. And I just get dragged along. Hey, listen, you and I are the only family we have and we are sticking together. Now, when this is all over, we will move anywhere you want, I promise. There's nothing to do here. You get to visit your Grandpa. (Fern scoffs) Even you think Grandpa's weird. That's why you always scurry home after a day or two. Whenever I see him, I feel like I'm in the Army. Air Force. Whatever, I have to make my bed, but I can't make my bed anyway I want to. I have to square the corners, like perfect. Perfectly. Whatever. And whenever mom and I used to visit, I'd always mess up his schedule cause I don't get up at five o'clock and I don't know when to go to bed, cause I can't remember what time 2200 hours is. Ten hut! Welcome to Camp Peterson. All new recruits up the steps, double time and hug your Grandpa. Hi Grandpa. What happened to your eyes? Why didn't you tell me about this? Did you see a decent doctor? Why doesn't anybody call. Nothing wrong with her eyes, Daddy. What? They're just sunglasses, Grandpa. You know, fashion? In December? Daddy. Excuse me. Is she gonna be all right? If we leave her alone. Didn't your uncle ever tell you sunglasses will run you blind? Good to see you too, Daddy. (voices vocalizing) ♪ Walking in a winter wonderland ♪ ♪ Walking in a winter wonderland ♪ (voices chattering) Mr. Peterson? Yes. Oh, thank God you're here at last. We're saved. Mrs. Buskins? Yes. Come on into the office. Hi, you must be Fern. Well, come on in, come on in. (bell dings) (Jake gasps) Stop that somebody will see. I don't care. I do. Daggone. (Margie laughs) So what do you want for Christmas? I got everything I need. How about a new radio? So you can listen to those old programs of yours on something that's got all its knobs. I like my old radio. I know how it works. And besides it was made about the same time my programs were. Ha! The ice age. Yeah. George and Gracie, "The Shadow," Jack Benny. They wouldn't sound right on a new radio. They need that tinny quality. Well, there's gotta be something you want. See this? Its a Christmas card from a wife of an old Air Force buddy of mine, Clark Kelso, he was our navigator. We flew 22 missions together. He was a great guy. Always laughing. Always making jokes. What'd she say? Clark passed away last November. Aw. First I knew of it. Now that's what I want for Christmas, to see my old crew again, what's left of them. That would really be something special. You don't know where they are? Not a one. We used to exchange Christmas cards, but I guess we all got too busy. Far as I know, I'm the only one left. We went through an awful lot together. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be here. So, what do you want for Christmas? A ring. Oh Margie, you know I'm too old to reenlist. Well now what's that supposed to mean? Well, I've been through so much losing Mary, losing my daughter. Mary was a fine person, Jake, but I got news for you. We've been dating four years come August. It's too late, we're already attached. If it's commitment you're afraid of Jake, maybe you should just get over it, or maybe I should just get myself another dance partner. Hi, Lily. Hey Donna. Is Dale practicing? Did you have to get Dale that tuba? Well, it could've been the drums. (Donna laughs) Mind if I join you? Sit down. Sit down here. What's wrong, honey? Nothing. Hey, I hear that band you used to be with is gonna be in Lexington. Are you gonna go? No, I'm too busy. Way behind trying to put together the Christmas concert. Can't fool me, kiddo. I know you keep track of what they're doing. Don't you miss it? Well, remember when I was singing with them, they weren't famous. It was just a whole lot of hard work. Yeah, I always wonder what would've happened to you though if you hadn't come back here to help out your ma. I don't think about it much. Well, I do. You were just as good as any of them. You could've been rich and famous too. We are lucky to have you. Oh, look who's here. Hey, Daddy. What? What? Oh, Cal, you remember Margie, friend of your mother. Oh, it's nice to see you. Likewise. Have you met Lily Waite yet? She teaches music over at the high school. How do you do? I'm fine, thanks. Jake's told me an awful lot about you. I'm sure he has. And this... Oh, that's Fern. Hey. She's adjusting to a few things. I see. Daddy, would you take Fern home? I got a PTA meeting tonight. Yeah. What's Fern interested in? Her hobbies appear to be mumbling, staying in her room, wearing black and being impolite. She's a teenager. Can't you get her outta that? Ah, come on. It's a great age. I wouldn't want to. Lily loves a challenge. Caleb Peterson comes to us most recently from district 42, where in one year he went and turned the deficit of $52,000 into a surplus... He's gonna cut the computer program. He's gonna cut the arts. He always cuts the arts first. Please give him a big, warm welcome. I'll make this brief. This school is in imminent danger of being closed due to lack of funds. I'm gonna have to sell the house. I'm gonna have to move to Seattle. Seattle? Everyone's moving to Seattle. I don't believe there's a single one of you here tonight who wants to see this school closed. You need your children nearby so that you can be a part of their lives at a very difficult age. But it isn't gonna be easy folks. These cuts are gonna hurt. I will attempt not to retrench job wise, and I entreat each and every one of you here tonight to support me in my efforts. I look forward to meeting all of you. Thank you. I should've taught shop. You should've taught social studies. They never get rid of social studies. Goodnight, Charlie. Goodnight, Ms. Waite. (gentle piano music) The key to all this you see is to think laterally. Joseph, I can hear you back there talking to Elizabeth. Please stop. ("Silent Night") Yikes, stop. Stop! Oh, that was painful. That was really, really, really bad. Clarissa, honey, your French horn bleat cause you didn't warm it up. But I did. No, you guys look, I want you to merge with your instruments. Don't make fun, what I'm talking about is becoming one with your instrument, okay? I want you to bond with your instrument. Yes Dale, hug that tuba. I mean, this is an extension of who you are. Get it? Now I know you guys are tired, but we have less than two weeks remember, before the big Christmas concert. So I'm gonna let you go early today, so that you can practice. Aw. Come on, let's go. Autumn, was that you practicing piano in the auditorium last night? No, ma'am. Didn't think so. (dog whines) (gentle music) ("Nocturne Op.9: No.2 in E Flat Major") (bell rings) Test tomorrow.

My mom. Oh. Was she a musician? No, she just liked playing the piano. We used to do duets and stuff all the time. Does your Uncle Cal know you can play like that? No. Don't tell him. Why not? It's not for him or anybody. It was just something between me and my mom. It was our secret. Hungry, soldier? Nope. How come? My math homework. I just don't get it. Well, take a break, try something else for a while and then come back to it. It's a trick I learned in the Air Force. How about trying a little KP? All right. Here you go. What program is this? Old time radio hour. That's the programs I used to listen to when I was your age. Why? Well, that's all we had. It was before TV. When dinosaurs roamed the earth we'd huddle in our caves and try to keep warm, listening to Jack Benny. Yeah? Yeah. During the war, my buddies and me we'd huddle around that radio like it was a campfire. Listened to those programs and reminded us of home. Kept us going. Okay, at ease, good job. Now, set the table. Four places, with enthusiasm. We having a guest? Yeah, yeah. I invited Margie over so you could get to know her better. She might be spending a lot more time here in the not too distant future, maybe. That mean what I think it means? Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm just not sure. What are you not sure of? I'm not sure I wanna return to active duty. I still miss your mother. Well, of course you do, but that's not a good reason for shying away from relationships. Relationships, that's what you have, relationships. That's why they never go anywhere. I've had quite a few really fine relationships. They just... They don't work out I move around too much. I'm not talking relationships with you. I'm talking marriage. How do you like school Fern? It's okay. Have you gotten to know Ms. Waite? A little. Let me tell you something about her. She had it all and she gave it all up to stay right here and teach. She doesn't toot her own horn. Pardon my pun. But there's nobody like her. You get to know her. She'll help you. She's single too. Of course, she stays in one place, commits herself to people. Not your type. Cheap shot, Daddy. May I please be excused? I made dessert. I'm on a diet. Well, I made it. So the polite thing is to eat it. I don't want to. Well, you can just sit here with us till we're all through. Yes, you may be excused. Thank you. Why'd you let her go? I'll handle her, Daddy. Thank you. You should have made her finish her plate. She wasted a good meal. If you don't teach her responsibility, who will? I'll get the dishes. You better start acting like a father, before it's too late. You ever hear of the word tact? There's something I need to talk to you about. Dessert will be ready in a minute, sit tight. Take your time. I know what I wanna get Jake for Christmas, but it's really big and I need your help. Well, I'm not feeling too generous right now. I know he's a pain in the rear, but I love him. And you do too. He doesn't know he's giving orders. You take it too seriously. Well, sometimes it's hard not to. I know. What do you need? I need any information you can find on the crew of his old B17. Like what? Well pictures, letters, names. Can you do it? Well, what for? Ten hut! Holy doodle, look at the size of that thing. ("Away in a Manger") Hold it. Good grief, people. Where are you getting these notes? Come on now. I'm at my wits' end here. Somebody tell me what's the matter? Well, this is the same old stuff we play every year. Well, it is called tradition. I call it boring. Sure is. Okay. Let's examine this. Are you guys bored with the tunes or are you bored with the way the tunes are played? Yeah. All righty. How about... (bright jazzy music) ("Away in a Manger") Excellent. Something like that? Or what about something like this? ("Jingle Bells") But you can't improvise on a theme unless you know how to play the theme correctly to begin with, right? Can you? No. Okay, let's compromise here. If I come up with something new and interesting, will you please promise to learn the traditional carols? Yeah. But can you do that? Well, I'll sure try. None of us wanna screw up in front of our parents, Ms. Waite. Well, have we got ourselves a deal then? (students murmuring) Great. (bright music) What song is that? Trying to come up with a new one for our Christmas concert, so the kids don't mutiny on me. Might be better if it were faster. Really? Oh, it doesn't work. Maybe something more, pop. Ooh, loving that. Do you think it needs a bridge? What about something like this? Hey, I really need help with this. Would you consider working on it with me, please? You can't tell anybody, not even Uncle Cal. Okay. Maybe you could help me out too. We could make like a trade. What do you need? I'm failing math and science, everybody says you tutor. Well, I can't keep that from your uncle though. Okay, ask him if you can come over. Well, we could do it right here. I don't want the other kids to know how stupid I am. You're not stupid. You'll see. May I speak with you just a minute? I'm very busy. It's about Fern. She wants me to tutor her after school, something I do for the kids, and I told her I'd check with you first though. She thinks she's in trouble? Well, she's not yet, but soon maybe. Oh, I've done everything I can. She's just like my sister. Same voice, same smile, same... Oh, I haven't seen that smile yet. No. She wants me to come over to your house, so the rest of the kids here don't know about it. Look, Ms. Waite, I... Lily, call me Lily. I would do anything for Fern, but I have to remain objective here and I can't very well hire you while I'm evaluating your program at the same time. Well, then how are you gonna help her? Well, I guess I'll just have to do it myself. It'll be a lot easier when I'm finished working here. I intend to settle down in one place, reasonable schedule. I understand. Well, good luck to both of you. Okay. The first rule of successful studying is to do it in natural light. That means take off sunglasses. This geometry book here and the old theorem. Here you go, now let's get ready. What seems to be your problem here? I don't get it. Yeah, yeah. But what don't you get? Any of it. Okay, that's a good place to start. I'll tell you what, let's turn over here to page 77. Now take a look at problem number one. And why don't you see if you can prove it using the rules on the previous page? What if I don't understand the rules? Well, they're obvious, Fern. Not to me. Written down right here. Proving what I knew all along, I'm stupid. No, no. Now that doesn't prove anything. Let's just start all over again. Now the deal is you don't understand the rules, is that it? Look, Uncle Cal, this is real nice of you and everything. But if you really wanna help me, you'll get me a real tutor. Honey, your mama was the best friend I had in this world. And she could do anything she set her heart on, and you're just like her. No I'm not, I'm alive. You're too soft on her. As I recall, when I first went into teaching, you said that that was soft, maybe I'm just soft. I just don't like watching you fail. Kids equate discipline with love. They know if you're hard on 'em you must care for them. Yes, I know. I believe I'm the product of your philosophy. It would've been a lot easier on me if I'd let you do what you wanted to, even though I have no idea what you wanted to do. At least you knew I loved you. (Cal sighs) Hey. I sure hope it snows around here. If I'd wanted sunshine, I would've moved to Florida with everybody else. What's that? I was only partially successful. Ooh. Well that's a place to start anyway. May I ask what you're gonna do with this? I'm gonna try and find these guys and invite them to come to Bethlehem. His crew? That's all he wants for Christmas. And I really wanna give it to him. It'd be a big surprise. Now that'd be something, wouldn't it? You don't have much time. They're probably scattered all over the country. Oh yeah, I know. But if you don't try impossible things, you don't get impossible things. Besides which I'm retired, I got nothing good time. You know Margie, your generosity is... Well, it's astounding. Oh. You obviously love my daddy. I mean, you can handle him. You ought to get a medal for that. But I feel that I oughta warn you. No matter how much you do for him, he's not gonna tell you how much he appreciates it. Oh, I know how he is. Now remember, this is a big surprise, so don't you go and blow it. I won't. It's a secret. Lips are sealed. Okay, thanks. (gentle music) Spying again? I don't spy. I observe. I heard you were good. I had no idea how good. May I help you Mr. Peterson? Well, as it turns out, I'm a lousy tutor. Oh, who says? My student. Oh, her. Mm-hmm. So if you're still willing, I'd like for you to come over to the house. This afternoon okay to start? Sure. Good. Thanks. Very good work. It's almost 1800 hours. Supper's drying out. Should we invite her to stay? No, no, no, no. That'd be inappropriate. So you all done, huh? We're finished and I'll be leaving. See you, Ms. Waite. Hey, would you like to come to the Christmas dance tomorrow night? I don't know. It'd be okay with you, wouldn't it? I'm one of the chaperones. Matter of fact, I think it'd be a good idea for you to get out socially. I'm gonna be working late anyhow. Can I think about it? Sure. Oh, here. So can I give you some advice? Sure. Stop hovering. I wasn't hovering. You two have been eavesdropping the whole time I've been here. Try and let the girl learn things in her own time. That's what I've been doing. She's not disciplined enough. Back off you two. I'm telling you, she's picking up on all this and I think it's scaring her. Well, it's hard. Well, maybe she can come over and learn at my place. Well, I'll take that into consideration. Thank you. You're quite welcome. Good night. Bye. I like her, don't you? Huh? Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. You decided about the dance tonight? I don't dance. Fern, you're gonna have to try and make some friends here. You gotta get out and see people. You gotta... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You do whatever it is you want to do. I don't care, you'll be fine. You'll be just fine. Can you hold these a minute? Do you really think so? I do think so. Yes I do. (bell rings) All right. (bright music) I took your advice. I gave her a little room. She decided to come on her own. I'm surprised you listened to me. Most people just shrug off good advice. I like advice. Oh Todd, have you met Superintendent Peterson? How do you do? Not formally. Are you going to claim the computer program? Because it's the future, you know, and you can't claim the future. I haven't made any recommendations yet. Everybody says you cut computers and the arts. I'm sorry they think that. Ah, excuse me I, I gotta go chase some future computer illiterates in the boys' room. I see smoke coming from under the door. And yeah, I guess I better get back work. Why don't you ask her to dance, Uncle Cal? Oh honey, I got a deadline. I love to dance. It really, it wouldn't be appropriate. It might be good for people to know that you're actually human, Uncle Cal. But you know, do what you want. No pressure. Uh-huh. I'm sorry. I really shouldn't. All right, maybe just one. Good, we like to see the old folks cut loose. Watch it, I'll demote you to the triangle.

Morning, Rae. Morning, Margie. Mm. Something wrong? You seem a little down. Oh, well I've been trying to find your father's Air Force buddies all morning. They're either dead or moved with no forwarding address. There's not one I've been able to track down. I heard you were dancing with Ms. Lily the other night. She's a catch, broke many a heart. She might break yours too, you don't look out. (Cal scoffs) I assure you it was only a dance. None of my beeswax. I like your house. This essay is the best you've done yet. Is this you and the band? Oh, yeah. The structure here is so much improved, and it sounds like you, not what you think I wanna hear. I've been thinking of this for the introduction. (gentle music) I like it. How about if you change up the rhythm, just a little bit. Good. (Fern laughs) Do you like Uncle Cal? Of course I do. I meant like, like. Oh... Well. He's too nerdy, isn't he? Not at all. I keep wanting to tell him, you know, to loosen up, but I'm afraid of hurting his feelings. He's so inhibited. Well, he doesn't dance like a nerd. (doorbell rings) Come in. You too about done for the day? We just finished. I got a B+ on my geometry test. Atta girl. And she did a terrific essay. May I read it? No, not yet. I'm still working on it. Well, maybe later when you're finished. Bye. Bye. She is just so improved. I am very grateful to you. Fern's a great student, and she's not satisfied with answers she doesn't understand. I love that about her. Listen, I need to talk to you about the other night. Well, evidently there a number of people who are talking about us. Well, it's a small town. You have to remember, there's not much to talk about. Well, anyway, I wanted you to know that I enjoyed myself immensely. Oh, I did too. And of course that's a problem. Hmm? Yeah, well, I mean under normal circumstances now I'd probably ask you out to a movie and maybe coffee afterwards. But I can't, you understand? Yeah, I understand. Just for the record, if I had asked you, would you have said, "Yes?" (Lily laughs) Uh-huh. (gentle music) Morning, can I get to school early today? Is something wrong? You're outta uniform. Daddy. Pancakes coming up. Hi. Sit down. No, I've gotta get to work. Oh, you got five minutes, sit down. Anyway, I'm not getting anywhere on this search of mine. Is there a way you can find out if Jake knows where any of these guys are? Can you check his Christmas card file or something? I'm running out of time. I've already done that. All the addresses were crossed off. I'm gonna have to buy him socks. Well, what about that old time radio hour? What about it? You know, it's broadcast nationally, but it's done right over here in Louisville. Maybe you could do one of the old timer minutes. They interview people live on the air, and Daddy said that he and his friends always used to listen that kind of radio, maybe some of 'em still do. Well, that's brilliant. I'm glad I could solve your problem. I guess I better go tackle some of my own. Well, I'll let you know what they say. Thanks. Yeah. Bye. One, two, three. ("O Little Town of Bethlehem") Yes.

I called the radio station and they said, "Yes." Oh, good. That's great. But the only thing is I can't go Louisville Sunday night. Why not? Well, Jake will suspect. Besides which I gotta stay home and distract him, so he misses his show. I really want this to be a surprise. Cal, you're the only one who can do it. I know. I know. And you're gonna have to come up with a darn good excuse. But don't worry, you'll think of something. But I... Oh, excuse me. Thanks. Excuse me. Betty! Betty, hang on just one minute. (gentle music) Oh. Hey, there. Hi. Did you have a successful afternoon? Yes actually, very successful. Good, good. Is Daddy at home? No, not yet. Well... Bye. Lily, wait up just a second. I need to ask you another favor. All right. Well, Margie wants me to go over to Louisville and be on that radio show and Daddy can't know about it. So anyhow, I need an excuse for going out on Sunday. Oh, an excuse? Yeah, and I'm really stuck. I can't come up with any viable reason to go over there except maybe... Well, a date. A date. Yeah, I think he might actually believe that. You want me to go to Louisville with you? Yeah and naturally I'd buy you supper for your time. Well, Cal don't we have a little bit of an awkward situation? Oh no, no, no, no. I thought about that. See, we'll be in another town. Nobody will see us. Aha. Unless of course you just don't wanna go. No, no, no. Anything for Jake. That's great, thanks. Well, be seeing you. (tense music) Well, I couldn't wait to hear your final report, so I came down to see how you're progressing. Come in. Why, thank you. Cozy. Nothing wasted on frills I see. Nothing wasted as a matter of fact. Oh dear. This school's been running on empty for 10 years. I'm surprised the building's still standing. Bea has done amazing things with nothing. Can we save it, is what I wanna know. I'm still working on that. Really? You're usually so quick. Yeah, well, this school's different. What makes it different? The teachers. It's an incredible group. Cal, what's wrong with you? You haven't gotten personally involved here now, have you? Not at all. Good, because that's not like you. The data's not in, that's all. Well, what's taking so long? Well, my computer was down for a few days. Naturally, there wasn't money in the budget to get it fixed. Well, I see it's up and running now. Yeah. Getting down to the wire you know. I know. Cal what we have to remember here is that there is something more important than just a few individuals. This entire school is at risk. Yeah. ("Deck the Halls") Well, we're kinda, extremely early. I guess I must have miscalculated the distance in relation to speed. Why don't we go Christmas shopping? Now? Come on. Why'd you give up performing? Everyone asks me that. Cause you're so good at it. When Mama got sick, I dropped out of my band to come home and take care of her. Meantime, I discovered I also love teaching. Lately, I admit I have been wondering what would've happened if I'd gone back to singing, when Mama died. (horn honks) (Lily laughs) How in the world did you get into bureaucratting? Oh, well my downfall began with social studies. I was a teacher once and I had this crazy notion that every kid in the richest country on the face of the earth, ought to have the best education for free. And then I saw that that wasn't happening. I saw the waste and corruption and the mismanagement and I realized my best effort was not gonna be in a classroom. And all this time, I thought you were a suit. I am a suit. Hello? It's me. Yeah. Ooh. What's all that? Well, I've decided we all ought to go on a picnic. In December? Well, that's why they invented thermal underwear. I got to finish trimming this tree, besides my program's almost on. Oh, you're too set in your ways, Jake Peterson. You gotta learn how to live a little. Come on. I've lived enough. Now I wanna take it easy. She's right, Grandpa. Maybe we should try something different today. After my program. They're just reruns anyway. Not to me. I listen to that program every Sunday afternoon and I look forward to it all week. You're not depriving me pf my program. That's all there is to it. You can keep that chicken warm in the oven. Mm-hmm. (clock chiming) That's a nice tree. What's wrong? The radio won't work. Aw. I got a transistor. Transistor? Batteries. Ah. It's out of batteries. Oh, isn't that a shame? Truck. Aw. (engine stutters) Poor thing. I sure wish it would snow, don't you? I sure do. Mm, this chicken's good. And they flew 22 missions over Germany before they were shot down. Well, how did they escape? They didn't. Daddy might've been able to, his parachute drifted and when he landed, he hid in some woods that were nearby. But the rest of his crew were captured. Daddy came outta hiding to be with them. They were put in a prisoner of war camp, for 13 months till the war was over. Was it difficult growing up with a man who had been through an ordeal like that? I don't know if I can answer that question. He's the only father I ever had. Maybe that is the answer. I don't get you. He never abandoned his crew. He had the guts to stick it out no matter how hard it got. And even when he didn't understand what I was all about... I always knew that he loved me. He learned the value of life during the war. And he taught that to me. I guess what I'm saying is he's a great father. He's one of the great ones. Now, Cal, would you tell our listeners why you came here today to talk about your dad? We're trying to find the crew of his plane, "The Crazy Dame." Of course we know about the ones who've already passed on, but we're having trouble locating the others and we kind of wanna surprise Daddy for Christmas. Well, there you have it. Anyone out there who knows the whereabouts of the crew of "The Crazy Dame," B17, that flew missions over Germany during the last year of World War II can contact this station and we'll convey the message to his son. It's a surprise. Oh, and remember, it's supposed to be a surprise. So if you're listening out there, don't let on. And on that note, I'd like to dedicate tonight's broadcast of "The Burns and Allen Show," to the crew of "The Crazy Dame," wherever you may have landed. Well, thank you. I had a good time. Lily, there's something very important I have to say. You know, as I was listening to you tell the radio announcer about your dad, I realized what a kind and thoughtful man you are. I've known a lot of guys in my time, but nobody quite like you. I just wish our circumstances were different. Not here. Goodnight, Cal. (gentle music) (phone ringing) Hello? Yes, this is she. Yes. Where are you? In Tacoma? Oh, I thought you were in Texas. I called the whole state. Do you know where any of the others are by any chance? Oh, great. Go ahead, I got a piece of paper right here. (phone ringing) Hello? Oh hi, Anne. Yeah, I was just finishing that up. No, no surprises. Make the coaching staff voluntary, no extramural sports and... cut the music program. Uh-huh. No, don't...Don't thank me. It'll just make this that much harder. Yeah. Listen, can you do me a favor? Can you hold off sending out the official notices for a few days? I'd like to talk to the people here first. Yeah. Thanks. Bye. (Cal sighs) Hey, Irwin. I'm still here. I never knew you two were such good dancers. Of course, asking him to dance wasn't an option for me. He's gonna fire all the men. That's his strategy. You'll be fine, Todd. Fire, retire. I have always enjoyed major life changes that rhyme. How could you do this to me? Don't you think I deserve to be told about something like this in person? They weren't supposed to send that out. How could you, Cal? I thought we were friends. We are. I can't believe I didn't see this coming. Lily, you're a good teacher. This has nothing to do with you. Yeah, right. If you really thought so, you'd have found a way to save my job. I did everything I could, but it was shut down one department or this whole school. Now what would you do? Will you just do me a favor? Don't you tell my kids about this so that they can concentrate and enjoy their Christmas concert. I won't. I'm sorry this happened. So, how'd it go in geometry today? Think it'll snow? Is something wrong? Uh-huh. May I please be excused? If that's what you want. Why is she so depressed again? I have no idea. Don't you think you out to go up and talk to her? No, not right now. I'd just screw it up. I'm too distracted. By what? Well, this is a secret, but I had to fire Lily Waite. Oh, for heaven's sake. Daddy, now I had to do it. Of all the stupid... I don't need you to make me feel any worse about it. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. You the superintendent we've all been hearing about? Uh, yes ma'am. Hit it, Dale. (bright music) Do you hear that, Mister? That's my son. He can't play baseball. He can't play basketball. He can't play football, but he can sure play this baby. Yes, ma'am. He lives for orchestra. All right? Do you hear me? He could go to college on a scholarship for orchestra. He could be the first one in our family. Now, if you fire Lily Waite... Whoa, whoa. How did you know Ms. Waite's being fired? Oh, everybody knows. Oh, Lord. Play it, son. ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ I said we wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy New Year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring to you and your kin ♪ ♪ Good tidings for Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ And a Happy New Year ♪ ♪ Oh Merry Christmas ♪ Y'all are very good. Thanks. Ms. Waite always taught us to express our emotions through our music. Excuse me. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have a lot to do today and I have some very exciting news. With the help of a friend, we've actually come up with a new song. What for? Nobody cares about us. How could they do this to us? What am I missing here? You don't have to pretend, Ms. Waite. We all know they deleted the music program. Yeah. Hey guys, come on. Whatever's going on with me is not your problem. Your job is to get out there and show this town what music means to you. Okay? Right? Okay? Okay? (students laughing) I am sorry. I am really, very sorry. You promised not to tell anybody. I have no idea how this happened. I knew they'd be upset, but they're absolutely hysterical. Why did you tell them? I'm telling you it wasn't me. Now they're having even more trouble playing their instruments. I was afraid this would happen and it's all your fault. Hi, Todd, Irwin. Can I sit with you? Oh, yes. I'd have willingly retired earlier. We're so sorry. Devastated, actually. God, I'm gonna miss you guys. Grandpa go to bed? Mm-hmm. How's the homework going? (Fern mumbles) Why won't you talk to me? Cause I don't like you right now. What have I've done? You fired my friend. No, I didn't, the state did. You told them to. No, I did not. I heard you do it. You what? It was an accident. I was outside your office when she was inside. You had the door open. I heard. Are you the one who told the whole town? I told Clarissa, that's all. Well, I promised Lily that I wouldn't tell anybody. Didn't you overhear that as well? I was upset. She said she wouldn't tell anybody else. Look, I don't want to fire Ms. Waite. I've done everything I can think of to do, to avoid this. Look, you've been really good to me, Uncle Cal, but you have absolutely no idea how much Ms. Waite has done for me. Well, pretty soon we'll be outta here, off to bigger and better things. What? We're leaving again? Yeah, I thought you understood that when the job... But I don't wanna leave. Grandpa needs us and I will never be able to find anybody like Ms. Waite, ever. Where are you going? I'm gonna show you what I can do. Hey.

Right. Yes, well, we've got a lot of nice motels in town. Well, if you can't get in there, you can always come and stay with me. Great. Okay, thank you very much. Oh, and you will call Dwight Varney. That's great. I can't thank you enough. Okay, bye bye. Sorry, can't talk. I got a fax coming in on the other line. What's going on? I would've called you, but I'm not talking to you. I just wanted to know how things were going. Well, ever since you went on that program, I've been getting calls left and right. I found half the crew already and they're all coming. And they're helping me find the other ones who are still alive. Wonderful. If I were still talking to you I'd thank you for this. I guess you heard about Lily? Who hasn't? Nothing I could do and I feel very bad about it. I'm worried about her. She'll land on her feet. She has a lot of connections. I guess she does. She's down about it, but the ones who are hurt the most in all of this are our kids because she's gonna leave. What can I do? Well, barring getting her job back, I guess the only thing you can do is make her feel that it was all worthwhile. And you can bring some people to that concert of hers. (fax machine whirring) I have to get that. You can let yourself out. (bell rings) You're like the ghost of Christmas future. Do you have access to the school files? Does Santa say, "Ho, ho, ho?" I don't suppose anybody has put the alumni in the computer? How else do you think we plan reunions? How many students do you have? What are they doing after school? You don't have to pack just yet. I don't wanna have to come back during the Christmas break. Lily, um... Could we not talk about this right now please? It's my fault. Fern overheard us talking in the office. I should have closed the door. She played a song for me last night on the piano. She's good, isn't she? She's got something special and wherever you move next, please put her in a music program. Don't you let anybody tell you that music isn't important. It's everything. There's a private school, over in Lexington, I can get you an interview over there if you want. Give you a glowing recommendation. You're the best. You know that. I know I've tried. I did everything I could. Is this your shirt of mine? It's mine, I think. Looks like something Margie might have bought me. Well, why don't you borrow it for tonight? What else you going to wear? Just my old blue suit. Sounds good. (gentle music) (Lily sighs) (horn honking) Where is she? We're gonna be late. No, no. As a matter of fact, Daddy, we're early. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Maybe you better just go in there and get her. All right. Hi. What's taking you so long? Oh, come on in for a minute, why don't you? We're late enough as it is. Yeah, we're all always a half hour early. Just come on in for one minute, okay? I just like to be on time is all. I know. I know. Hold it! (bright music) Ten hut! Present, up. My God. My God. My God. Oh, Frank. Joseph. Pete. Oh, Ben. Harlan. Oh, Bud. I don't believe it. I don't believe this. I never thought I'd see you guys again. Oh my. (Margie laughs) You did this. Merry Christmas. Daddy, you consider wearing this? Where'd you find that? Up in the attic. I had it dry cleaned. Oh, it probably won't fit after all these years. Well, I had it altered just a little bit too. There you go. Oh. Yeah. Who do I think I am? Those days are over. Don't take it off, Jake. Wear it, you earned it. All these years I thought you guys were dead. We never should have gotten so out of touch. I got the internet. You got the internet? I got it. You know what, Daddy? They're right. You deserve to wear that. You mean that? Yes, sir, I sure do. Merry Christmas, Daddy. Merry Christmas. I just want you all to know what a privilege it's been teaching each and every one of you, and how much more you've given me than I could have ever given you. Tonight is a real special night. This is the last time I'll be conducting the Bethlehem Christmas concert. So I'm gonna ask one last gift from each one of you. I'm gonna ask that you guys play with your hearts as well as with your fingers. And I want you to play as if your instruments are really part of who you are. And I want you to play, because you love to play. I love you guys. Autumn, are you ready? Yeah. Are you set? I'm ready. Okay. Are you nervous? No. Oh honey, your mama would be so proud. So proud. (voices chattering) Lieutenant, no one has ever given me a finer gift. Oh. Why have I been so afraid to admit how much you mean to me? Shell shock? I'd consider it an honor, if you'd marry me. Oh. Hi. Hey. Bea asked me to introduce you tonight. You don't need to do that. Well, truth is I asked for the job. Really? So you'll be leaving Bethlehem after Christmas, huh? No, no. As a matter of fact, I've decided to stay. Really? Yeah. This is gonna be my last job as hatchet man. Gonna be a teacher again. I'm taking over Irwin's position, teaching social studies. I'm happy for you. Thank you. But you do still have to find a music program for Fern. Yeah. And even if you and Jake have to drive her all the way to Louisville, you find one. I believe I got that taken care of. If it's all right with you, I'd like to go out alone and just pretend that tonight is like any other Christmas concert. That's fine. (audience applauding) (audience cheering) Well, I think it's safe to say that Ms. Waite is surprised. (audience laughs) I think she expect about 30 of y'all to be here. Lily, all these people have come here tonight to pay tribute to you because they admire your talent and your drive and your ability to inspire even the shyest of people to risk performing and to give it their best. The members of this audience have also very generously donated their money to the newly begun, Bethlehem High School music fund. In addition to which, the members of your old band who are with us here tonight too, right down here. They have endowed a scholarship in your name for any of your students who might wanna pursue a career in music. Now with this money, we will be able to keep the music program going here for another couple of years. Yes! And that ought to give us time to figure out how to do that permanently. And now, before I do what I do best, which is to shut up and get out of the way, I would like to officially commend a truly great teacher. A lady whose generosity of spirit has touched and changed the lives of every person in this room. Thank you, Lily Waite, Bethlehem's a better place to live because of you.
