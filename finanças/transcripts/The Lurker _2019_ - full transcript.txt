Hey. I just, I uh... it's urgent that you... What? My love. My wife. Death that has sucked the honey of thy breath. Hath no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou are not conquered. What the? Why are you dressed like that? Is the play over? Look, if this is about what I think it's about, I haven't said anything to anyone. Our little secret, right? I, I swear. I, I promise. Juliet? Why art thou yet so fair? Damn it! Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous? Keeps thee here in the dark to be his paramour? The doors to breath. No. No, no, no, no. You, you, you don't have to do this. Please. I won't tell a soul. Help! No! You don't have to do this. Please. No, no, no, no. Seal it with a righteous kiss. Taylor. Can you hear me? You've been through quite a lot young lady. Do you know how lucky you are? Can you remember much? Anything at all? Grace Fisher was a guidance counselor at Crystal Lake High. She was brutally slain last night when an unknown assailant approached her as she was leaving for the evening. Police are urging anybody with any information to reach out to Detective Ace Hoffman. Your tips will remain anonymous. Details of the wake will be on this evening's broadcast. What a loss. You know I don't like it when you sneak up on me like that. I'm sorry about last night. I don't like when we argue. Things are really complicated right now. Gross. Can you not? Oh honey, I, I didn't see you there. Did you get the tickets for us for tonight? Yes, front and center as always. Don't forget my cast party's tonight. Okay, I can come and pick you up. I mean if there's gonna be drinking I just really want you to be careful. No, mom I'm fine. Stop. Hey, here don't forget this. You ridin' with me today? I'll walk. Well, I don't care how you get there but you better get going or you're gonna be late. Hey there Taylor. Hey. Drew right? Of course it is, my dad had the same name. Had? Yeah he's, uh, he's gone. It's a long story. So uh, how've you been? Considering? Been better. Thanks for asking. Real question is how have you been? It may not seem like it but I'm living the dream. Pretty crazy huh? I think it's exciting. Well, it's been nice talking with you but uh, I've gotta get back to work. Toilets won't clean themselves. Sorry I'm late. Class is nearly over. Can't keep lettin' you off the hook. It's not fair to the other students. The best part of my morning is spent imagining him naked. That is so gross Hannah. He's like 40. Oh come on Lily. You're telling me you wouldn't fuck him? No. He's a teacher. Besides, he's dating Taylor's mom. You know her, he's like the flavor of the month. Besides, I think you'd be surprised what teachers are capable of. Ladies. There she is. Gracing us with her presence, the star of the show herself. Everybody bow down. Let's get a fucking red carpet over here. Oh come on, I'm just kidding. You're gonna have to get used to all the attention when you make it big on Broadway. Doin' alright? Looked like he was giving you quite the earful. Yeah, I'm in control of the situation. What does that even mean? It means I haven't forgotten about yesterday. Barely made it to class, Taylor. What took you so long? Yeah, I was just taking some photos. I was talking to the janitor in the hallway. Ew. You mean Drew? No, I mean ew. Barf. Guys, I've been thinking and I feel like murder is in a janitor's skill set. Everyone find a good stopping point and have a seat. By now I'm sure you've all heard about Grace Fisher. A tragedy truly. She was a wonderful woman. We've all suffered a loss. I know this is a tough situation. It's something we all never thought we'd have to deal with. I'd be happy to answer any questions, or maybe someone has some comments that they'd like to share? Okay. Let's talk about those midterm projects. The deadline is quickly approaching. [CLASS BELL RINGING[ Comin' Taylor? No, I'll meet you down there. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. The leading lady skipping class? I'm not skipping class, I'm in study hall. Just grabbing a few books. You know the rules. Study hall or not even Juliet needs a pass. I'm writing you up. You will need to report to detention after school and what a shame. I guess your under study will have to perform in the show tonight. You must be dreaming if you think that detention is gonna keep me from performing. Sorry Tory, your time to shine will come soon enough. A detention might not but I know what would. You wouldn't dare. Wouldn't I? I'd be really careful about what you say and who you say it to. You should be thanking me. I did you a favor. How are you feeling? Fuck you. Well, my mouth is shut for now, but when the final curtain closes tonight. Break a leg. It'll be your last time. Study hall was too loud. It amazes me because we all have finals this week and no one seems to care. Senioritis at its best. That's why most of them are gonna end up in community college and you're gonna be living it up at Harvard. Think so? I'm kinda nervous. Early acceptance letters are coming out soon. You'll be fine. You're the top of the class. You're still studying that thing? Your performance last night was spot on. Arthur gave me a bunch of notes. I just wanna be my best. I thought I was the perfectionist. Well someone always told me you gotta finish what you started. Hey are, are you okay? You seem kinda out of it. You've been acting kinda different. Is everything okay with Emma? I've been sensing weird vibes. No I'm telling you, there's something off. Look, I've said it once, I'll say it again. It had to be somebody who... Would you let me just do my job? Okay? We're exploring all the options and when someone has an alibi, quite frankly it makes things harder. No. No there's something off. What about that girl that uh, Grace Fisher mentioned on her voicemail? Taylor, this is Detective Hoffman. Okay, thank you for your help Mr. Scott. I can take it from here. Oh, well please take good care of her. She is my top pupil in class and on stage. Okay, you have nothin' to worry about. I'm just gonna ask her a few questions. Sure. Okay, I'm the uh, lead detective on the Grace Fisher murder case. Did you know the victim? No. Uh, not really. Did you ever have any interaction with her? Freshman year. I, I met with her a couple times. Okay. And those conversations, what were they pertaining to? Taylor? Sorry what, what was the question? What were you and Miss Fisher discussing freshman year? She was counseling me for my dad's disappearance. It didn't, it didn't help much, but time kinda healed that wound. Before Miss Fisher was murdered she left a voicemail for Arthur. She mentioned you. Now we have reason to believe that your life may be in danger. Have you noticed anything unusual around here lately? Unusual? Life threatening? No, not at all. Am I gonna be okay? You need to stay careful. Okay? Be vigilant. This is my office number. If anything else happens or you hear anything more pertaining to Grace, please call. Get in touch with me day or night, okay? Okay. Let's go. That's it? What? You know how my stomach gets before a performance. I eat whatever I want whenever I want so. I have a lot on my mind. Shh, shh, shh. Oh Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? I want to perform for him. That show would be over before it even started. What show? Don't worry about it. Just talking about the last performance. Me worried? No, no, no, no, no. See I wasn't worried. Oo, hello, hello ladies. Now see look, I mean if only you were as enthusiastic as your gal pals here. Oh my God, I'm looking forward to our death scene tonight. Can you just fuck off? Okay, I'll fuck off. Really? You're lucky. Hardly. I would rather suffocate to death then have to lock lips with him again. Hey, can we talk in the bathroom? Yeah. Alright, spill? Taylor, what's going on? You still worrying about that? It was just a joke. You went too far this time. I already apologized. What else do you want me to do? Well a detective just pulled me out of my class and he said that I was in danger. It was the best decision for your future. It wasn't your decision to make. You know, I don't want that getting out. You know how that shit spreads. Even Tory... Tory's a dumb cunt. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll talk. I made sure of it. Listen I know that... I don't wanna talk about it. We were just joking around. Yeah. I would appreciate- Listen, what you did was disgusting, and I wish I hadn't seen it. I'm not talking about this again and I think it's best if you did the same. To all of you she may have been just a guidance counselor, but to me a friend taken too soon. So, I think it is fitting that we dedicate this final performance in her memory. The highest degree of proficiency, skill and excellence. You know that's how the dictionary describes perfection and I expect nothing less of you. We are going to hit all our queues, our lines and our marks. We are going to remain focused! No excuses. Welcome gentlemen. Ladies that have their toes un-plagued by corn will have a bout with you. Come, musicians play. A hall, a hall, make room. Foot it girls. Hello? Hello? Is everything okay? Miles, is that you? Look, let me just finish this smoke and I'll come back inside okay? I'm sure you're just joking around but I'm really not in the mood for games. Please, somebody help me! Somebody please! Please don't! Please don't, please! Please. Please stop, please! No, no, no, no, no! Nice job, nice job. Good job. We are back in 10 minutes guys. 10 minutes. Taylor. Would you join me over here? I really liked that first scene. What exactly are you doing? What do you mean? I've seen cripples dance better than that. Did you even study my notes? Yes, I studied your notes. I, I hit all my marks. I'm projecting. I had high expectations for you. Clearly my trust was misplaced. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to call Juilliard tomorrow and cancel my recommendation. Afraid you'll just have to try again next year. Why would you do that? I have no idea where this is coming from. We're back in a few minutes. Okay. Finish the show. We'll discuss this later. Drew. What are you doin' out here? Uh, it's not a problem. You alright? You feeling better now? Look I'm sorry. I'll, I'll, I'll clean that up after the show I... No, you know what? Don't worry 'bout it. I'll, I'll, I'll get it, I'll leave it for the birds. Thanks. Uh, you know, I've been sneaking little peeks of the show. You really are a star. Thanks Drew. Means a lot. See ya after? Break a leg. Two more scenes and I am almost done with this nightmare. Don't pay attention to him. Juilliard doesn't deserve you. You're gonna go to your second choice and then you're gonna slay the theater scene there. Oh, you're being supportive now? Guilty conscience? Hey, good job. Thanks. Yeah for whatever reason that fight scene just wears me out. Out of shape huh? Hardly. Just gettin' started. You know I was thinkin' I was thinkin' maybe, maybe at the cast party we can... Yeah that's quite the fantasy but I'm gonna pass. You know after tonight I don't even wanna shake hands with you. Hey you know what Taylor? You don't need to be a fuckin' bitch. - Excuse me? - Yeah, yeah you heard me. I heard what Arthur said to you. Figured gee, let's be the nice guy. But you know what? It's your loss. These violent delights, have violent ends. What the fuck? Oh that was only a kiss. The rest is yet to come. Can we give it up for Miles? Such a fantastic actor in every single performance of this show. A true talent. Yeah! You guys did Grace proud. Have fun tonight. Have a blast. And those of you who are not returning for another show best of luck to you. The rest of you, see you next semester. Now as you all know per tradition, cast party at my house. Yeah boy. Now for those freshman, it's just across the baseball field out back. Do you know why I snubbed you? It has nothing to do with your acting. In fact I've always thought you had enormous potential. Arthur I... I'm not finished. Do you wanna know why I'm a director? It's because I can read people. It's what I do for a living. I don't know what you're talking about. You can cut the act. I overheard that little conversation between you and Emma in the bathroom. You have no idea what you heard. All these years I have been grooming you Taylor. What do you hope to accomplish with this distraction? What have you become? Fantastic, magnificent, perfection. I'm glad you thought so. Aw, you shouldn't have done that. I didn't. Someone sent them to the house. I can uh, put them in a vase for you at home. What's wrong? You look sad kiddo. I'm alright. Just exhausted. Hm. I know it isn't easy. Try and keep everything in perspective. What do you mean? I know how hard school can be. When I was a freshman I was pregnant with you. What I'm trying to say is that this'll pass too. Thanks mom. I guess I'm pretty lucky that you kept me huh? I'm sorry that William couldn't make it. He's out. No it, it doesn't matter. It does matter. It's important that he take an interest in my only daughter's accomplishments. It's okay mom. You know, like dad says what goes around comes around. That's my daughter. You ready for the party? You deserve some fun. No, I'm not really looking forward to it actually. That's the wrong answer. Hm. I fucking hate him. That's kinda harsh. Although I can't believe he said that. It's kind of out of character. Out of character? The guy's a dictator, not a director. He needs to remember that he's teaching drama at a high school. What should I call this one? What are you doing? Um, my name is Taylor and I'm the lead in the play and every guy likes me and my life sucks. It's not funny. I'm gonna go to the best college and everything sucks. Since when can you not take a joke? Dude it's senior year. You did a beautiful job tonight. What's wrong? Taylor, she's right. Plus we're graduating soon anyway so it doesn't even matter. And we'll be on to bigger and better things. I always forget how big this house is. I'd kill to live in this house. Hm. What's this? Oh, come on. Don't look so surprised. Same rules as last year. I promise I won't take any photos. Emma come on, phones and keys in the bucket. You know the rules. Last thing I need is these fuckin' cops comin' here to ruin the party. Wow. Thought you were actually being responsible. Dad's rules, okay? Not mine. Let's go. That a girl. Good girl. Good girl. Nice, nice. Good job. Well, I hear there's a party goin' on out here. Who wants to turn it up? I said, who wants to get fucked up? I see a lot of new faces out here lookin' up at me like who is this guy? Well I am the party master. Alright dad. Hey you're making an ass out of yourself. Just go inside okay? Whatever you say son. Who wants to get this party started? This gathering, unraveling here before me my friends. This is the real party. Though I have to say, must say that, I'm surprised to see my dear Juliet at this Montague soiree. I'm just as surprised as you are, trust me. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs. In this case, the party favors we shall all share. One for you. Hey listen, I won't smoke too okay? Fuck it. I'm all in. I am tired of being the smart girl, the good girl, that boring ass lame girl. I am entitled to a good night. I deserve it. Alright, that's what I'm talkin' about. Lily, takin' a hit. Can we just go? Before one of us does something that we're gonna regret. What is it buzzkill? Did you tell Miles? Don't worry about it. Don't worry. I'm just gettin' it ready for a huntin' trip tomorrow. You havin' a fun time? Yeah, just looking for the bathroom. Say, you're Taylor aren't you? I have heard an awful lot about you. Hm. The uh, the bathroom's just around the corner. Thanks. Taylor are you okay? I'm worried about you. Taylor, open up I have to pee. Taylor. So, you and Vinnie huh? Okay, that is like a one time thing. Are you really gonna judge me for that? Why wouldn't I? Listen, I think it's great okay? Like crazy but great. Taylor we've been friends for years. You really think I wouldn't notice? Not drinking, mood swings, not smoking. You're so pregnant. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'm pregnant. I mean like I knew it. You have to tell me who. Like, I'm dying to know. Hannah, okay no one knows. Can we just keep this between us please? Totally, yeah. Love you. Bathroom's all yours. Mr. Little, is there a phone I can use? Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah everything's fine. I just need to call my mom. Well I could give you a ride. No, no, no. It's fine I just need to call her. Alright. The phone's in the kitchen. Thanks. Well I'll, see you in a bit? Are you having fun? Oh, hell yeah. Just need to find a good mixer. I'm tellin' you, we need to do this every weekend. Hey have you talked to Tory? Mm mm. Haven't seen her since the show. Damn. They've got a lot of expired food in here. I'm sure Tory will show though. She always does. You know, she told me about uh... That was just a rumor. You know how rumors spread. Even so, we've kept our mouth shut. You and Tory don't get along but, I told her to put herself in your shoes. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with us. Well I appreciate that. That's disgusting. Why don't you come join the party? Well, well, well. Just in time for the competition. Winner gets my last blunt. Fantastic, just what I wanted. I saw you in there, flirting with my man. First of all, he's not your man. He has a girlfriend. In the spirit of fox hunting, the favorite in my family, we shall be venturing apart to the woods rather. See, in this particular case I will be the fox. And you all are hounds. Oh yeah. First one to catch me gets the prize. What are we five? Grab a flashlight. Begin to search in uh, let's say 10 minutes. I feel like you're quite the hypocrite. What you did to her was just as bad. But, you're right she could get in some serious trouble. She already is in trouble. One of the girls in costuming overheard the police talking. Apparently the guidance counselor left a message on an answering machine. Something about someone coming after Taylor or something. Jesus. Well, I'm glad we don't have to deal with that. Hey. We done yet? Uh, no we are not done yet. Can we just go already? Appreciate your enthusiasm of winning but I was being honest when I said I didn't wanna play. Uh, you owe us because you've been a buzzkill all night. And that's coming from Lily, so you know it's serious. Okay well this is hardly productive. And you're the expert on that? All I'm saying is you know if we split up it will increase our chances of winning. You guys she's totally right. If we all go our separate directions, our chances of winning are gonna quadruple. That's exactly what I just said. Okay well, thank you. Bye. Fuck you! Guys! Taylor, what's wrong? There, there's someone in the woods. What do you mean? Wait you, you didn't hear that scream? They're, they're coming. Taylor, what the fuck is wrong with you huh? I mean get your shit together. God damn, it's a good thing she didn't smoke any pot tonight huh? I think that's exactly what she needs. Come on guys. You, you didn't hear that scream? Okay what, what about Chloe and Matt. How uh, what about them? Ain't it obvious? Ran into the woods on the bang train. Clearly my man's about to nut. Lucky mother fucker. I don't feel so good. Jesus Billy, you drink much? I'm fine, really. Pour, pour me another. Guys he's gotta go to the hospital. I tell you, I only saw him take a few shots okay? Alright son, the party is over. - Wait, I've been keepin' an eye on him all night dad. - No. There is too much liability. Billy, can you hear me? We can't risk this happening to anybody else so put the booze away. Dad look, this is fuckin' bullshit okay? No. Not this time. You either do as I say This is not my fault. or you're not going hunting tomorrow. Alright everybody, I need ya to hang tight inside. I'm gonna drive Billy to the hospital and when I get back I'll drive each and every one of you home. You're not to drive yourselves and you're not to leave the property until I get back, understand? The last thing we need is another incident like this. Help me carry him to the car. Alright, let's go inside. Let's go. Where do you think you're goin', hm? Unless you want me squatting on your basement floor, I suggest you move, please. I'm sorry, did I scare you? And did you by chance mistake this for a bathroom? Hm? Did you? God, you're a tricky one. Great actress too but, I'll tell you what if you're lookin' for the condoms, 'cause this ain't the drawer I keep 'em in. Okay you need to stop talking like that. It's not funny anymore Miles. And yet, you're the one who came to my room. Ever heard of sending mixed signals Taylor? I'm sorry or should I say, Juliet? I've always wanted to roll play. Fuck off. What's it gonna take you to leave me alone. You see it's complicated there. So anyone have plans this weekend? I feel like shit. I might see a movie. Hannah? Would you wanna come with me? Uh... Fuck it. I haven't had a drink in ages. I'm fine. Bye guys. I got a little secret for you. It's a little one. And I've been waiting for this fuckin' moment for a long time Taylor. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Hm, let me think. How 'bout you, me, alone together. In fact the funny thing is Taylor, the funny thing is I didn't picture being here in my bedroom of all places. - Miles... - No you fuckin' listen. I know all about it Taylor. I mean if you could sleep with him right, you could fuckin' sleep with me, right? But don't worry, shh. Your secret's safe with me for a price. Little price. You're drunk. Mm hm. You see I know what you're capable of now, I do. Mm hm. And guess what? I kinda, I kinda like it. No, no. I'm, I'm... Uh uh uh. See, I know what you're capable of now and in a funny way your brought this upon yourself Tay Tay. Okay now this is how we're gonna proceed. I'm gonna remove my hands. If you fuckin' say a single word, if you mutter, mutter a single yelp guess what? Your secret will be a secret no more man. I'll shout it down the hallway. I'll shout it from the rooftop. Oh. Oh, is she gonna cry? Oh come on. Really, I was only joking with you. You like it rough huh baby? What the fuck's that face for? We need to get out of here! Whoa, slow down. What, what's going on? What happened? There's something after me Emma. What? What are you talking about? Someone was following me uh, was chasing me. No one's chasing you. Come on, sit down. Have a drink. No, I don't need a drink. It got Miles. Taylor's what's, what's wrong? Are you okay? Where's Hannah? She went back to the school to get her spare car keys. No, no. You shouldn't have let her go out there by herself. It is dangerous. Alright, look uh, sorry to interrupt but what were you saying about Miles? He's dead! Okay? Something is up there trying to get me, trying to get us. No, no. You're just trying to scare us. This just seems like one of Miles classic jokes. We should get out of here. How's that gonna protect you? He's got the right idea. It's better than nothing. Okay yeah. Guys we look like idiots. Okay? What am I gonna do with this? What are any of us gonna do with any of this stuff? No, we're puttin' this down. We're done with this. Alright, look there's four of us, there's me, we got this. Hey, what's goin' on? Where's Miles? Hannah! Hannah! Hannah! I'm so sorry I doubted you Taylor. I thought you were going crazy. We just have to look for a weapon. Maybe it's just me but I don't know, don't you think it's possible we're all just on some crazy trip? I mean, I smoked a lotta weed tonight. Or the thing that killed Grace is hunting us down? Where are you going? We have to stick together. I'm just drainin' the snake. Chill out. Look, I'll be right back. Freakin' idiot. We're just gonna stick together and we'll be safe. Why don't we just get the fuck out of here. - What about Hannah? - What about her? Her car's still outside. She could be in here. Not our problem. I hardly think that it's... No, she, she, she's right. We need to look for Hannah. She would do the same for us. Get out! Hold on! Go, go, go, go, go! Get out! No! No! No! This is taking too long. If we split up it'll go faster. Lets meet in 10 at the cafeteria. If you find a phone call for help. Emma! Can I go with you I, I don't really wanna go alone. Yeah. It's dead. Taylor, who do you think's behind all this? If I knew that I wouldn't be standing here. It's gotta be the janitor. I mean like, the janitor shows up, the guidance counselor's murdered and now we're around being hunted like wild animals. I don't think he's capable of murder. But cutting the phone line? Taylor. What? Okay come on, let's go. Here we go. We're stuck in here. Yeah well, at least we're not out in the open. I'm sorry. For what? It's not your fault. Did you know? Hey. Taylor! It's not a big deal. I know what Emma did. Emma? What's going on? Taylor are you okay? We need to hide. What's going on? What happened? Where's Lily? We have to get out of this school. It's a death trap. If only I hadn't thrown in my keys. I think I have an idea. Can you drive stick? I don't know about this Taylor. The boiler room is connected to the offices in the basement, I think. Well, what have you like, been down here before? No. And you're sure the transportation coordinator's office is on the other side? I guess so. We either cut through here or we go back to that hallway with that lurking thing around. What do you wanna do? Watch your head. Taylor, Taylor! Hannah! Oh my God! We need the key. Drew? Drew? Drew is that you? Is that you? Taylor! Hold on! Taylor! Help me! Help me! Where are you going? That'll be us if we don't get out of here. Let's go to the subway. No. We should stay and fight. Taylor, have you lost your fucking mind? Do you hear what just happened to Hannah? She got sliced and diced like a fucking vegetable! Yeah, well that's why we should stay! Taylor! Take a look around us. We've watched as our friends have been murdered in cold blood and you don't seem to give a fuck. I'm getting out of here. I'm not the one you need to worry about. I'm, I'm gong with you. Fuck! We're in here! We're in here, let us out! Fuck, fuck! We're in here! Fuck, fuck, fuck. You bastard! Come on, Emma. CREEPY SYNTHESIZER My God. We have to help them. Do you see that? This is too much. That's gross, he's like 40. Who do we tell? The principle's gone for the day. I'll think about what to do. I'll make a decision by tonight. It's very important Taylor does not know that you saw this. I saw your little hump fest out back. It was a one time thing. I'm not the one you need to worry about. You little fucking slut. Cum dumpster sounds more like it. Don't worry, we're here to help. It would be over immediately if this got out. Don't worry, we've got this covered. Hey I was just kidding alright? Don't actually do it. Don't pussy out. Like you said, it's what's best for her future. Next time wear protection. We can't always be there to help you. I mean think about your career. Taylor, Can you hear me? You've been through quite a lot young lady. Do you know how lucky you are? Can you remember much? Anything at all? Anything? What the fuck's that face for? It's all sort of a blur. That's okay. These things take time. Listen, I'll let you get some rest and we can talk about it later. If I'm not mistaken, you have a visitor. Oh, before I forget congratulations on the little one. Oh. Uh, thank you. Uh, can we keep this between us. Yes. I came as soon as I heard. It's so good to see you awake. Do you, wanna talk about what happened? He was abusing me. I'm still not sure about this whole plan of yours. Well do you love me? That's not fair. You know I do. And I didn't know how to tell you mom. Well you've seen the shows, you've read the books, you know how this is gonna end. Local teacher sleeps with an underage student while dating her mom at the same time. I'm so, so sorry sweetie. Best case scenario you get prison. Have to live your life out there. The worst case scenario... Look the way I see it you have two options. Help me kill them all. Or fuck it, go turn yourself in now. Hey. We're in this together. Let's just contain the situation before it spreads. I, I wish I had seen the signs. I, I can't even begin to understand what you've been through these past... Just the three girls. Just three girls? Mm hm. I know what Emma did. But I, I can keep a secret. You weren't supposed to be a part of this. It's okay. That's what friends are for. No. You don't understand. I mean, did... It's okay. You know, we don't have to talk about it. I uh, I, I brought something that I thought might cheer you up. Can't believe we pulled this off. I still don't understand why you wanted me to take pictures of all the bodies. It's all part of the plan. The bigger picture. You seem upset, what's wrong? You weren't supposed to hurt Drew. Couldn't be helped. I wasn't going to ruin the whole thing because of one person. He was out snooping where he shouldn't have been. Don't be mad. I got you quite the nightcap. Hope you like it. Shut up! Arthur. Too bad you were stuck here all night. You missed quite the performance. You want me to do it? I've gotten pretty good. No. You tried to ruin my career, my plans, my future. I've got this. I told you that you would get in. I guess all the practicing paid off. Catch. We're finished right? What's next? I never really loved you. Um, did anyone make it? What? Um, out of the house. Did anyone else escape? Just you and that uh, Billy boy from class. Apparently he got here just in time. You know he's uh, down the hallway. When you're feeling better, you should go and visit him. I'm sure that he would love to see your face. Taylor? Sorry.
