She puts stale bread on her balcony To attract sparrows and pigeons She lives someone else's life In front of her television She wakes up without an alarm clock When the sun rises Without sound, without fear The day passes Ironing, dusting There is always something to do A meal on her own Her only grip A house that is so neat that it is suspicious Like all those places where people do not live They have given up Lost the battle Things won Now it's theirs The time that breaks us does not change her The living wither... Oh, Guillotine. You look bad. See you tonight, dear ones. Be nice, huh. Be beautiful. Open up. New. Get out. She puts stale bread on her balcony To attract sparrows and pigeons She lives someone else's life In front of her television She wakes up without an alarm When the sun rises No sound, no fear The days pass Ironing, dusting There is always something to do A meal on her own Her only grip A house that is so neat... My bag! Here, ma'am. I'll get that bastard. Good morning. Good morning, Esther. Do you play guitar? My bag has been stolen. While I listened to music. Never relax. That fabric of yours didn't like. But I had woollen cloth. Is this what? Beautiful fabric. Thank you. I cook for you. Yes, I have to go. They all want to cook. Do I sometimes not eat? Good morning, Esther. How are you, Andrée? Good. Hey. Jade, honey! Hey beautiful. Everything good? Yes. Did you eat? What are you having? No idea. Does not matter. Everything good? Yes. Tea. Ketchup? Algerian sauce. Samurai? Yes. Happy Birthday. It's not my birthday. Take it. How beautiful. That really touches me. Thank you. Is it gold? Nice? Insane. How did you get that? It's a gift. Shit, it's a Jewish star. What is this? Jewish star. For real? Do you listen to that? It's a pole star. You can't wear that. Your mother will flip. It's as if you are converted. What nonsense. Does this come out of the bag that we stole? Stealing religious things brings bad luck. Is that a thing? Quiet. It is true. Give it back. Give it back. You're already having a hard time. You are not Cinderella. Don't make it worse. Thank you. She is right. You steal all day long. Makeup, not gold. That is different. At least gold is useful. Makeup too. You're going too fast. Take two. Left hand? Then you get married. That's still possible. We've been groping silk for so long. Time for real life. Help me with the flowers. Andrée, stain remover. Fast. Is this too pale? Excuse me. My bag has been stolen. For real? It's true. I was not paying attention. Snatched away? Yes. Continue. This... Will you sleep with me? My mother drives me crazy. Then sleep with me. I have to stay at home. I'll call you. I am home. It's about time. What's up now? What? I was almost starving. What do you see pale. Do I have to see black? There aren't many whites here anymore, but... Mumu stays. come. Will you massage me later? I have neck pain. Come. Where were you? I've been waiting all day. With friends in Paris. Here. What is this? Present. Stolen? Stop. You stole it. Do you know who you see? I got it. I'm not crazy. Are you still there? Yes. No one is waiting for me at home either. They are with their father. You know, Catherine... even if you follow me you don't have to imitate me. Are you okay, Esther? You seem upset. Your last show isn't easy. No. Why do they want you to stop? Afraid of me salivating on the tulle. Or trembling when embroidering. Considering the price of the fabric... It's understandable. Now you get time for yourself and you can enjoy. Here I enjoy. This is my world. This dress... I know. What do you mean? I mean this dress... just a ghost. A ghost? Are you okay? This. Not crazy, right? Classy. Nice. Everything fine? Hi mum. Hi, Selim. I have couscous for your mother. Thank you. Tomorrow I will make meatballs. Nice. She calls you "the saint." Saint Manoubia. Do you hear that? A saint. My husband doesn't know. Come home. Who does she think she is? Is she going to act tough? Hear him now. Quiet. She annoys me. Hey! Here's the tagine. Is called. Not that accent. Your father is Arab, you know. I do not know him. Can't I joke anymore? Leave the door open. Good night. No idea. I wait. A woman with expensive clothes. Number 21 is pleated. Can I help you? No thanks. Young lady! I know you! There was a... Everything is there. I have your guitar at home. Hold on. Is it also stolen? Where's my necklace? Where is it? Here. I didn't steal it. No, that star is hard to lose. Stupid ghetto kid. What did you say? Get the clothes on. Yes, get over it. Can't you say anything more? Does it have to be politically correct? I am gone. I'm going out for dinner. I'm hungry. Shit vocabulary. Wait, ma'am. I have your scarf too. This was also included. Give here. Come on, come. How did you find me? Your ID was in your bag. Yes. What else do you do except... find bags? Are you in school? The University? No way. I am normal. What are you doing then? Nothing special. With those hands you can make beautiful things. Better to choke than peck. By choking I mean sewing the fabric of the dresses. Yes, understood. I recognize good hands. I'm a seamstress. I saw that. On your ID. Without commitment you achieve nothing. It's a concern for me. Me too. You determine your own life. What is it? Nothing. That's alluring. After two desserts? Depressed or something? What? Depressed? I don't have time for that. The collection must be finished and... then the customers come. I'll take them. No. Yes. The profiteroles. Still no dessert? Why not? You don't have to pay. Are you paying? No, so don't whine. I do what I want. I have always obeyed. This is fine. Quiet. I'm calm. Don't say it. I am gone. I'm sick of it. Are you back? The chorba has been ready for hours. And? What? That woman from Dior? A hysterical person that started screaming. So embarrassing. For real? Unreliable, Parisians. I'm here. No answer. What is it, Mumu? I do not know. I'm here. Yes, you are there. So? I'm here. This is tiring. What's in my soup? That's chorba. Can't she make anything else? I'm sick of it. Hey. This is private property. Of course. Like you are at home here. Otherwise I'll call the police. Are you serious? Yes, the police. How can you be such a traitor? Look at yourself. Pretend you're French? Don't forget where you come from. I got you through. Wait! Don't touch me. Will you stand there? Yes. Collaborator. Come to us and your balls will go off. What do you want? Do you know her? Yes. No. A little. You can go. Really? Yes. Fuck off, moron. What are you doing here? Pastry to thank you. From my mother. Does your mother bake? The embroidery samples and the velvet are there. Finally. Thank you. Give it to me and make yourself useful. Jump! What? Move. Help him. Right. hop. The embroidery. And the pleated fabric. That was about time. Put it here. Who is that? Hi, I'm Gloria. Hey. Are you the new intern? Good idea, Gloria. Are you interested? For what? To lend a hand. To help. I do not know. Don't stand there. Go over there and watch. Catherine, an apron. And wash your hands. We wash our hands often. Because of the fabric. It's mega expensive. Which size? S. What's your name, honey? Jade. And you? You can call me Catherine. Thank you. Come on. This is the suits department. Give me the pins. This? Yes. Cap forward. Right. Precisely. Is this your first internship? Yes. This is the dress department. And there they make jackets and pants. Esther is the studio head. The boss. And I'm number two. OK? And currently I am making a model. We do that first, for the real fabric. To see the volume, the curves. Ah, no, no. Hands off. Beautiful, huh? It's very valuable. Even after 20 years I'm not tired of it. What a craftsmanship. You don't see anything like that in Saint-Denis. How do you know I'm from there? No, I'm from there. From Les Francs Moisins. What? I live in Le Rond-Point. Unbelievable. Esther, we're from the same neighborhood. Unbelievable. Welcome, honey. That is promising. Never mind. Do you still live there? No, at Les Lilas. Bon appétit. Thank you. We haven't been introduced yet. Abel. Nice to meet you. Is your name Abel? Your name has got to be Mohammed. No, my name is Abdel, but Abel looks better on your resume. The mythology, the Bible... I just lied. Come here! Fast! Bring the tulle and the silk! Gloria, put on the 11! Fast! Is she undressing now? Seriously, there? Is that normal? What is going on? That's the art director with his assistants. They check the work. Is that why they are all shitting their pants? If there's a slightest mistake they have to do everything again. Which one is your friend? Tell me. We also have these shades. That is beautiful. Nice. French made? Of course. Good. What do you think of our new recruit? Fine fingers, sharp eyes. That will be something. What do you think? Don't know. Why not? Do you want to do an internship here? How much does it pay? Enough for what you can do. Give her a sample to practice. And tomorrow 8 o'clock. So she trusts you. When she comes, I'll treat you to croissants. You make a blind hem, OK? What? That's what it's called. She can't do anything and immediately asks for a salary. So, you have a rag from Dior? No, it's silk. You are a rag. Andree, you can go to the bakery. Good morning. Here. I said 8 o'clock. Not 8:07 a.m. And, that rag? That is not bad, no? Not completely perfect yet, but... Come and watch with Marie. Dexterous fingers. Can we watch? Yes. Hey. What are you doing? Putting lining in. Do you see her hands? Very relaxed. That's the lace side. And that comes on the tulle side. Feel it. Feel the fabric. Go ahead. Washed hands? Are you not hot? No, I'm fine. Nice, huh? It's sweltering hot here. Did you eat? No. Look how she holds her hands. She never leans on the fabric. It can deform. May I feel? Yes, go ahead. Soft. Very thin. Silk tulle. That's what we use almost exclusively in haute couture. Better than Saint-Denis, huh? Do you like it? It's okay. You've got talent. But not ready for the mannequin yet, yet. With such hands and a lot of effort you can make beautiful things. I do what I want. You don't see me anymore. I like to be able to do something. Do something? You're sewing a piece of fabric. I met a girl. She's not easy. I like her. Sorry. What? That brings bad luck. Yes, that true. That really brings bad luck. It's a pair of scissors, not a bomb. To the kitchen. Everyone! To the kitchen? Move. What are you doing? Scrubbing your hands to avert an accident. It's very important. Okay, enough. No, again. Are you not superstitious? No, no time. Good Lord, I'm afraid. For what? Never mind. She's... She's a fashion model. Enough. Back to work. Esther rejected Manon and took that child from a suburb. Manon had hands to chop wood, not for embroidery. Get lost. How long have you been doing this? For a very long time. For real? Ten years. No! Ten years at Dior? No, five years here, but now they are my family. You spend all day on a... Yes. Isn't that frustrating? To each his own. It's going to be a long day. Let's go. Put your heart in it. Isn't she wise? What is she doing? Spraying perfume. It's to counter the smell of sweat, when we work harder. I do not want that. I am not a toilet. Hi, Sousou. Are you there, uh... You may still be angry. Or you are sleeping. I'm at work. Good... See you tonight. Big kiss. The 12 has yet to be finished. What time is it? It's already 6 pm. I have the kids this evening. Then you'll see them tomorrow. This has been going on for ten years. Go to your girls. I'll finish it. Here, it's pulling. It'll be fine. Why do we torture ourselves 14 hours a day ... Cracks in your fingers. You can go. You can go to China. What a hassle children are. You shouldn't have gotten them then. I'm going. Always friendly. What are you doing there? What do you care? Lost the keys. Selim has lost them. Is my mother not in. You could come to my house. With these rascals? Do you want your mother to collapse? She's vulnerable. Are you rascals? May I? No. Don't touch. Hungry again? I'll take some anyway. What did you do this weekend? Nothing. Yes, look after them. That's enough. Get off. I didn't do anything. Hop it. Your bag! I hate it here. It's like a prison. A penal camp. Then learn a trade. Do I look like I'm going to work? I will not become a slave like my father. I work everything, unemployment, assistance, housing benefit, LOL. LOL? Yeah, LOL. France can go to hell. Nonsense. We are France. Yes, of course. She works for "Dior, j'adore." Now she's French. Yes. Talent from the region. Solid artisan. You're from a banlieue, and you know it. No, I'm French. Do you sing the Marseillaise? Yes, look. To arms, civilians... Are you serious? Are you deranged? Form your battalions... What is that? Miss Dior. Is that for me? Yes. Don't let me down anymore. Because I miss you. I didn't let you down. Run your fingers through my hair. Is that it? Scratch it. I'm still itching. It's nice if you do. Harder! Don't complain. Not so gently. Ouch. You are annoying. Good morning. Aren't you off work? Yes, but the collection has to be finished. Where's the perfume? No idea. Is it here? It's not about the cost, considering the materials here. It's about the deed. Andree? Do you have something to say? It seems clear to me. Nope. Just explain it. I can only say... I'm surprised it's only happening now. What does that mean? Nothing. It seems clear to me. So, no. Explain. Dirty whore. You can't insult people. It confirms what people think about banlieue girls, that they are worthless, or worse, violent lunatics. It does not matter. Yes, it does. Otherwise you wouldn't be there. You must learn to control yourself. Jade, go help Marie. Immediately. Children... Yes. Have you heard from your daughter? No. I shouldn't have trusted you. I wanted you to unfold. By teaching you a trade with which you could make some beauty, to fix the world, in some way. At our level. As a gesture, for the beauty of it. And what you did is... ugly. You don't fix the world with hemming. Certainly not by stealing. It was not me. Of course it was. It was for my girlfriend. I've been neglecting her, since I've known you. You pretend to be my mother. Your daughter ignores you. Get out of my life! Forever! What are you doing? I'm paying with repairs. Can you do my boobs? Doesn't Dior do that? Haute Couture Breasts? How's that shitty lady? She is not. Take me with you. Are you ashamed? Is everything alright? She even gave me a dress. That is beautiful. Great. It's not great. It's a black one, like something for nuns. So what? You like churches. You're always dissatisfied. Who is that? That's her. Who? What her? Hi, is that for me? No. You perfume for tomorrow. You'll pay for the vial. What? Why does she have to pay for your gift? Now I understand you. See you tomorrow. You don't ask for money for a gift. And then that nun dress. Shut up. Goodbye Madam. Quiet. You're just like my father correcting me. Shut up. She likes you, you see. Otherwise she wouldn't come. And that dress. Shut up! I'm giving you my opinion. Do not nag like that. Jade found the vial. She's going to perfume us. Have you washed hands? Yes. Watch out! Esther! She's bleeding on the fabric! The silk is spoiled! Well no. Yes Well, no. We'll fix it. Shit! Andree, calm down. Shit! Marie, help Jade. Jade is bleeding. Take her to the kitchen. Come on, Jade. See you Monday. Nice weekend. You can go, Jade. See you tomorrow. Tomorrow? You will be alone. Tomorrow is Saturday. So? I'm going out on Friday. You're going to sleep? No. I'd come. That is a beautiful blazer, Madam. She is well dressed. That's not a blazer. It's a jacket. Of wool. Tailored, to Dior's taste. Not cheap. No, not that cheap. Can I feel for a moment? It is pure wool. with a silk lining. A thick silk. Against the cold. Normally it is territory. District... Ridiculous. Just like your acrylic sweaters. Ugly. What did you say, madam? Hooves. Nike, new collection. That's not a collection. You don't know what a collection is. You will sweat. Your underwear will stink. She's deranged. 8am, not 8.15am. I did not sleep well. Sorry. Relax, I was just kidding. Shall we? Get your apron. What are you doing now? Oil, it glides better. Okay, here we go. It's lower than planned. Wait... Give it a good pull. Harder. Right. That's right. It's beautiful. It is not finished yet. A dress is not alive until you wear it. Esther... Doesn't it bother you to make expensive dresses, and to work on Saturdays for starvation wages? I don't get starvation wages. And that's not the point. It's not about the price but for the value. The value, not the price. Do you see the nuance? You still live far out of town. The nuance, the value... You put all your energy into your work. How are you talking about work? What you learn is a craft. That's gold. You can transfer that. Take it everywhere. That is real wealth. You enrich yourself with work. No. Not with work, poor child. With a profession. Your pride, your imagination. The feeling that you are useful. You are a poor child yourself. Stop with those shapeless sweaters. Horrible. Fleece is warm. Fleece... It's ugly. Bye, Esther. Bye, Amina. There's your daughter. That has changed. That's not my daughter. What is it? Don't look like that. We're closing. Yes, shut up. I have to catch my train. What are you going to do tomorrow? To live my life. I wanted to go to a museum. No, I won't. Why not? I already feel uncomfortable with Dior, so the Louvre... Just go. See you Monday. Good evening. What is it? Your mother passed out. My mother? She gave us your number. She has diabetes and eats sweets. Her bag was full. We're taking her home. Stay with her. She lives alone. Okay I... Come with me. Good. Come on. Yes. I can't come to home. Sousou, jealous of an elderly person? For real? Hey? What? She hung up. Those Arabs. Nice but emotional. Go home. The elderly can handle it. Offended? Not by an uneducated child. Eat something and go to your girlfriend. I'm exhausted. I am going to bed. What do you have? Okay, a suicide closet. I am not suicidal. Don't say that. Such a closet if you have diabetes, then you are tired of life. I love life. It's not mutual. Typically Jewish. Jewish or not, I'm taking a nap. That sounds provincial. Abdel asked me to pre-coll party. Are you coming? What is that? Pre-collection party. Just for the collection. Fashion jargon. For real? Aren't you ashamed of me anymore? No, I've always been proud of you. What should I wear? I'll set you up. What? I am not a Christmas tree. Do not complain. I'm sick of it. Let's go. The jet set is here. Jet set? You're crazy. He is crazy. Yes. I'll be right there. We come from the favelas. We don't have the same habits. What? The Middle Ages are over. When I said at school that I came from Paris, they asked my real address. And that is? Paris. Not the favelas. I grew up in Paris. My mother is a lawyer, Arab. I lived in an apartment. For real? You're just like them. This is delicious. Do you want too? Rihanna? Stop. I thought it was her. Maki Sushi, get out. She asked for a cheeseburger with no cheese. I do not speak English. That's barely English. A cheese burger... Yes, without cheese. Simple right? I'm going. Don't go home late. Tomorrow we work. On Saturday? No free Saturday before the show. Weekend without Saturday. Cheeseburger without cheese. I grabbed a lamp. There is balling. No. Come on. What are you doing now? What are you doing? Jade, are you deaf or something? Arabs, huh. They bewitch you. Just die. I will call you tomorrow. Leave a message. And Cinderella, had a good night? Your butt turned into a pumpkin? I think I'm in love. What nonsense. No really. Awesome. Very nice. I dropped a roll of fabric, an accident. Are you mad or what? I didn't look at her breasts. Okay? And she's blonde. And I'm full of cliches? Can you hear yourself? Asshole. Everything OK? Can we go back to work? Yes. You weren't there Saturday. I had something. Or did you want to see someone? Your hands go in front of your ass. Otherwise you won't get anywhere. Just call me a whore. What do you know about me now? Reply. Look at yourself, With all that "seducing the fabric"! Does not matter. Don't talk like that. You are as dry as your wool. Clear? Can't take criticism? Go back home. Nobody expects anything there. And now, go. Out of my studio. Go! This taffeta is precious, it is impossible to order it again. Check your needles. It can't be spoilt. Open it. Bye, Esther. Sorry, I'm a little late. Abel, give me the muslin. Act normal. Shall we cut today? Yes. That side is too thin to fall well. I've always said that, but nobody listens. Why are you crying? You are so hard sometimes. Look after, hard people can suddenly break. You're right. I am gone. Then you solve the late deliveries on and all changes. I'm leaving, yes. No, Esther. Wait. Just solve it when the liner needs to be replaced. Who's covering you? Who doesn't eat to fix your mistakes? I also regret that she is gone. It does not matter. I will help you. Thank you. Sorry I... I knocked. The door was open. Who are you? What do you want? A friend of Jade's. Jade is with Souad. Wait, I'm calling her. Can you help me up? Yes, of course. Thanks because... I have a hard time getting up. I am depressed. Headache. Will you take me to my bedroom? What are you doing here? She helps me. Sorry, I need to rest. What? Like this. Mom... I thought you might would like a keepsake. The skirt you made. A Dior skirt? I want you to keep it as a keepsake. A Dior skirt and you joking? It's not your size. All right, I'm going. I still have things to drop off. Do you know people here? Yes. You have a lot with you. Help her, Jade. And get me a Coke. I'll come with you. No. You stay. I am bored. There's something scary on TV. I'm not just going to watch that all alone. Goodbye Madam. Nice, isn't it, my embroidery. Not junk. She has beautiful hands. Suitable for sewing. You tell her. I took her into the studio, but she hesitates. Stupid. You have beautiful hands. Do you want to try? I cannot do that. Then you don't know what you are worth in the profession. I don't have a job. Don't pretend. She didn't live through the war. But if you don't want... Then you do something else. Okay. All right then. Right. Well done. You're not much encouraged very much, are you? Not really, no. Have a look. She picks it up right away. It's never too late to do something right. That's what I said. You fired me. Three lumps. Look, that was Mr Dior as a child in his nice suit. He was handsome, wasn't he. That's his mother. That's the famous Bar jacket... That was designed for her. And I have one. How beautiful. Is not it? When will the embroidery be finished? When it is finished. I hear you have to retire? It seems so. What are you going to do then? Bore myself to death. You're lucky Esther is training you. Just like with Catherine. She has a reputation in the business. You have dexterous fingers. Yes... Yes, and a shitty life. The tissue paper is flat. Thank you. Right. Perfect. You can recognize craftsmen by their tools. It's time for your own stuff. Who is that for? Are you stupid or what? She's stupid, isn't she? And modest. Thank you. With my initials. I am carrying on. Get on? Yes. Have you seen my bag? Are you also addicted? What are you talking about? My mother swallows the same antidepressants. Addicted, diabetic... and I'm a problem case? What relaxation is allowed. Sorry, not for me. I have enough problems. Close the door. Close your mouth. Get a grip on yourself. Voicemail again. A week before the show. Okay, I'm going there. Get to work. I'll be right back. "Get to work," like she's Esther. Like she's at home here. Shut up, Andrée. Yes, shut up. Esther! Esther! Shit, what is this? Hey? Rue des Acacias 22 in Athis Mons. A suicide attempt. No idea. There are all medicines. So you wanted to kill yourself? That's logical. As if my mother isn't enough. Stop it. Tell her. No traces of benzodiazepine. She broke her wrist on the stairs. We gave her insulin. But her wrist is broken. Broken wrist? Well done. Broken, do you hear that? What do we do now? And what about the collection? How do you get it all done now? And you would be strict? You are disturbed. Do you want a tranquillizer? I do, then I can't hear her. She takes nothing more. Nothing at all. Okay. can we go? We go. I am coming. What are those types? My friends. I'm hungry. Do you think she... He? ...can take me somewhere? Your girlfriend? From now on everything changes. No more stupid eating habits. No more hospital. No more snacking. Everything good? Yes. With you too? This is Esther. This is Sephora. Good. I'm hungry. Then eat. Get in. Good food. Here. What is that? Tofu? For real? Yes. There are new rules. I'm here every night. And Souad is here during the day. I'm not dying. No. But she is unreliable. However? There is fruit, vegetables, everything. Okay? I did cooking school. Three months. I can cook. See? I'm going to my mother. See you soon. Awesome. And don't steal anything. Because I'm Arab... Because I'm Arab do I steal? All tasty. Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves were all Arabs. Then I'll go with you. Do not shout. Tofu. I really don't eat that. Why are you doing all this? Because I want it. What do you want? To become a seamstress. You just want a decent mother. With a nice haircut. Shut up. It's true. Nonsense. We're going. Bye. Bye. Will you drop me because... am I sick? Will you leave me alone? For a woman you don't know. She is really sick. You are just alone in your head. You do not love me. Never did either. You prefer a rich woman. She's rich. She's not that rich. Do you love me then? Come on, answer. Do you love me? Answer. You've been bringing me down for 23 years. You act like you're sick. With you I avoid trouble. We avoid problems. She gave me a chance you never did. Does it bother you to hear the truth? What have you done? Except for that shit on TV and that stupid faith. Shut up! No! Satan! Stop, Mumu. You're crazy. Look. Look, Manoubia. She is crazy! She is crazy. My mother is crazy! I'm tired. Go and take care of that seamstress. Live your life. She needs help. I am here. Just go. I cannot anymore. Just go. come. Is that your daughter in that picture? Yes. I didn't dare say anything. The way you talked about her. I thought she was dead. So no. I am dead to her. She is angry. She doesn't want to see me. I dare not call. I don't speak to my parents either. Because of all this. Why don't you call them? Because they are dead. It is too late. But not for you. Not for you. You're probably right. My God, all this... All those... Loneliness? That shitty loneliness. That's not haute couture vocabulary. There's very little time until the show. And despite Esther's absence, let's do our best so she will be proud of us. I'm counting on you. Let's work. Shall I massage your shoulders? No, it's not necessary. It will be fine. She said with the dot, but... Not too much steam. And then past it. Okay. Clear? Do not press too hard. Perfect. What are you doing? I am practicing. I'm bored to death. It won't be long. Hello Mrs. Cremieux! What do you have? Nothing. Show me. It's beautiful. As always. Magnificent. Here, transvestite. Put that away. Behave! For what? You have to accept who you are. I call a spade a spade, even the spicy things. One can't always be gentle. No. Everything fine? Jade? Didn't you stay the night? I need to speak to you. Andree is misbehaving. Catherine told me to shut up but we've hit rock bottom. What have you got there? Did you fight? Yes. With Andree. Who is Andree? She works there. It's her fault. She said that you compensates for your lack of love with street girls and chocolate, so I hit her. I can understand that. I gave her a thump. Well done. Then she threw your stool at me. What did you say? I quit. I'm going to take care of my mother. Then you agree with Andree. Yeah, so? Yes, what? Then the malice from Andrée will win. That's stupid. Yes, that's stupid. This show is your chance, Jade. Go back. No, I hit Andree. Everyone wants to do that. You have to finish that dress. No. Catherine is great, but I came for you. And you are no more there. Oh, no? No. There is something I can do about it? No. No, I'm not going back. What is it, Andree? Why are you always angry? And are you against everything? No, everything is fine. Wouldn't you talk about it, anyway. It's easy for you. Everyone likes you. We would like to like you too. You don't know anything about my life. We all have problems. All of us. Esther, you are here. Gloria, undress. Catherine, action. Abel, go and get Jade. She's at my home. You can convince her. Where do you live? I know that. Bye, Esther. Andree, is it good? Are you calm? Are you getting the petticoats? There is room for everyone. Did you get hurt badly? Sorry I... could not... Hold Andree back. Well tried. You were as happy as an Italian When he knows he Loves and drinks wine And I For the first time I finally felt Like a woman. Woman. Shut up! Calm down. Who is that? What is he doing here? There you have that bastard. You are jealous. But how... What an hotty. She dares to come back too. Scandalous. I'll tell Blandine. Then I'll report your racist comments too, and that stool you threw. And how you pushed her into the kitchen, and how you stabbed her with your finger. I saw everything. Can we continue working? Esther. The pleated work is finished. Come and see. I am coming. Is there something wrong? No, it's fine. You are trembling. No. Not at all. This is your last dress. Yes. Let's keep in touch. After twenty years of working together, to be suddenly gone... That's difficult. For real. We have been through a lot. Are you going to cry? No. Not now. No, no. This is Sylvie's voicemail. Please leave a comment. I'm hungry, Manoubia. Come on, it's time. But I... I can't, Manoubia. You know that. I have pain in my back. You can do that, Mumu. For real. What did Jesus say again? He said, "Love one another." See? That doesn't happen every day. Stop it, Mumu. Stop. Jesus also said, "Get up and walk." Obey Him. Get up, walk and then eat. I love you. Sure? Then you're in the shit. I'm not easy. You are. We'll have a great life. We'll start our own fashion house. Me as a designer, you as a seamstress. My first. Why can't I be the boss? Is the man above the woman? Who's on top now? Smart ass. Here. For you. Bastard. I was looking for you. You look beautiful, dressed as a girl. Can I sleep with my mother tonight? I want to see her. Yes, that's normal. Will you be on time tomorrow? I always am. They asked him, "Then why do you baptize, "if you're not the Messiah?" Thanks for everything. Thank you. Make sure the show goes well. What are you doing here? Aren't you with Esther? Sephora is here. And you're going to sit here? Yes. What is it? What have you done? Nothing. Swear not to scream. I swear. Let's go to see Jesus. You are coming to church? I am not sunbathing for the Virgin. I have to say something. It is a miracle. Your mother has risen and walked to my house. What? She has changed. She walk all the way joyfulnessly. Truly? I swear on the Quran. Stop talking about the Quran. Each his own cross. You are also Arab. Do you know why I became a seamstress? No. To imitate my mother. She passed her life in Dior's studio. Even after his death. Her life consisted of the studio, the show... and she forgot me, her daughter. My father... he wasn't there. Like you. You're not the only one. And, very young, at 13, I wanted to be a seamstress. Do you know why? Because I thought... by showing interest in dresses my mother would see me. Is that the same dress as ours? Yes. The last dress she worked on before... before she died. Her last show too. Just like mine. You will not die. No. No. Do you know... your daughter... Your daughter needs you. I was as stupid as my mother. I neglected her for my profession. Like by staying with Dior I would find my mother again. As if she would show up behind a mannequin or a test model. What do you think, Abel? It falls perfectly. I start with wool. With me. Mommy? Yes. Good to hear from you. Everything OK? Yes. Can we see each other? Here. Everything is in it. Also the apron. I am curious which dress you are going to work on. Do I hear that from you? We keep in touch, huh. Yes. Here. Embroidered shortly after you started. It's a tradition. Thank you. I knew it would work. That you were one of us. That you could. My name is on it. Thank you, Esther. Shall we continue? Sorry. I'll take it. I've been running. I was with my sister for a while. She lives in Block C. It's insane. Come on, there's champagne! That way. Are you coming? Yes, I'll be right there. Hang on. Nice. All those people... That is beautiful. For Jade. And to all well-meaning women.
