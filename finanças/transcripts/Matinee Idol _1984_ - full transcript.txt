MATINEE IDOL - Now Lance, the media has never commented in interviews on how uh...big you are. Any comment? - Look I don't think about that, I've never measured it. I guess it's pretty good. In fact it's great. You know they are all big on screen. - Well do you enjoy your sex scenes with co-star "Linda Hand"? - Well Linda Hand is the studios top female star. That's why we work together. - And do you get together off camera? - Linda and I have our own private lives. The only time we are together is when we are shooting. - Well I am sure you have a very busy life, and it must be draining. - Not really. - That's what I've heard. - Oh. I tell you what why don't we have dinner tonight, and maybe we can continue this conversation about my after hours reputation. - Sorry Lance, I can't, I have all these things... - I hate to interrupt your interview Mr. Hardy, but literally speaking we have to get this fucking scene shot. That's uh if you can be up for it? - Yeah Well, international box office star Lance Hardy has to get it hard! - Ok heat em up! - Box office star, really? Your watching too many of your own movies. Now if your cock was as hard as your head maybe we could get started. - You know you have a terrific mouth. - So I've been told. - Especially when no words come out of it. - Oh for gosh sake Linda, This is supposed to be a sex scene. Your a nympho... Instead you are acting like my wife. Quiet on the set everybody. I'm sorry. - Ok, ok. Let's just get this started, so we can get this dumb scene over with. - You know he's right. - Roll sound. - Rolling. Speed! Speed, mark it! Marker...action! - What did she do? Awww did it hurt him? Linda bit Lance on his most precious asset. Ok Phil, There's something I want you to say to both of them, for me, and Mr. Kuntz. Tell them to stop acting like Prima Donnas, and finish the fucking movie! Now if they don't do it, they will never star in another picture together again. Or separately either. Oh what did she do now, Phil? She did what? Alright Phil, I'll, I'll get back to you. Lance said something to provoke Linda, so she bit his cock and walked off the set. - Lance Hardy, boy asshole. Harvey, somewhere out there there's got to be another schmuck with a pretty face and a big putz and able to cum on que. And if I ever find him, I'll run Mr. Lance Hardy's ass right right out of Hollywood. - You know Bernie, this asshole that you're talking about, his last three pictures netted us 1.8 mil. And that doesn't include the licensing fees for the Lance Hardy vibrators and the Lance Hardy dildos. - He's still an asshole. Harvey I'm gonna put out a casting call. I'm gonna get two new stars, I'm gonna replace them both. - Just in case you've forgotten. We've taken a couple of advances for another Lance Hardy Linda Hand picture. So, we better come up with a Hardy-Hand picture. - Hello? Hi Ginger. No, I really don't feel like going shopping today. Well I thought I would just, um, I don't know sit around by the pool and answer some fan mail. Ok, sure! Alright, bye. Dear Ms. Hand, I'm one of your many fans. I jerk off to all of your movies. Once, the theater manager caught me and kicked me out. Now I go to another theater. Could I have a picture of you? Your devoted fan.. Huh, how sweet. - It's 78 degrees on a beautiful day in Los Angeles, and you're listening to non-stop music on you're favorite radio station. K-LOV... K-L-O-V - Yes? - Uh Ms. Linda Hand? - Yes, what do you want? - Uh, I'm here with the Apex pool service. I'm here to service you. I mean the pool, service the pool. It's your regular day. - Where's Mr. Miranda? - Uh, he's in Europe on vacation. - The pool business must be pretty lucrative. - Oh, well if it's not convenient now I can come back at another time. - Well, you're here now you might as well come on in and get it done. So what's your name? - Cochran, ma'am. - Just Cochrane? No first name? - They call me Bud, ma'am. - Tell you what I'll call you Bud if you stop calling me ma'am. Make me sound like Queen Victoria. I think I'm still too young to play that part. - You are the Linda hand from the movies aren't you? - You've seen some of my films? - Uh, I've seen Good Enough To Eat and Genitals For Blondes. Since I've been here I've been to the Pussycat Cinemas a couple of times, but back home a group of guys and me we go to the theater almost every week. - It won't bother you if I lay out here and get some sun, will it? - No, ma'am. I, I mean no, no it won't. - Bud, why don't you come over here and put some oil on me. Bud? Is this part of your usual service, Bud? - You, you see anybody in the water with me? - No. - What do you think? - I don't know. What's the score? - Not the game, schmuck! What do you think of the act? - Eh, what's the big deal? She only gets one channel. - Turn that thing down a little, would you honey. You've got an interesting act. We'll let you know. - You've got nice tits, tits. - We'll let you know. Thank you very much. - Next. Thank you very much. Send the next girl in, will ya? Next. I can't take much more of this. Call back that girl, Daisy. - Uh, Buttercup. - It's Daisy. - Oh yes, yes, uh Daisy. Uh, Daisy, Mr. Cox and I, uh, would, uh, like you to test for a part we've got coming up. We think you'd be perfect. So why don't you come back here next Thursday and on your way out you see Dorothy our secretary and she'll give you all the details. How about that? - Ok, can I put my clothes back on? - Oh, of course my dear, how thoughtless of me, how thoughtless of me. - Oh, and I wanted to thank you both. - Oh, my pleasure, my pleasure. Uh, sly dog. Bye! Next Thursday! Harvey, Harvey, it ain't easy. But... Someone's gotta do it. Harvey, why don't you go see my tailor? - Cochran you know, you really oughta be in pictures. - You mean in fuck films? - You certainly have a way with words. - You wanna give me another audition? - That's exactly what I had in mind. - Mr. Hardy, you spilled cum on Mr. Cox's desk. - Ah, that's too bad. Why don't you put some on Kuntz's desk too. - Mr. Hardy... Thank you. - Lance you're late again. You know you've gotta give up this "I'm the greatest sex machine that ever walks" stuff. You know? We've got a screen test to do today. - I know I'm sorry I'm late, ok? Oh hi. I'm really sorry I'm late. - Ok honey, get him hard. - Huh? - You've got some approach, Phil. - Uh, Miss, honey, uh what's your name? - Daisy. Daisy Cheney. - Well Daisy, didn't they explain to you in casting what was expected of you for this screen test? - Well sort of, I guess. - Then you do understand that Lance Hardy is going to insert his thus swollen penis into your warm, moist vagina, and plunge it in and out for as long as possible, until hopefully you two experience the primal pleasure of an orgasm? But, before any of this can take place first, he must have an erection. And that is what we are asking of you now. - Well just tell me what you want me to do. - For God's sake girl didn't your mother teach you anything? Tickle his asshole, titty fuck him, suck his toes, sit on his face, work it by hand, do anything, just fuckin' do it! - Um, excuse us for a minute, ok? Good. Don't mind him he is a little nervous I guess. I was late so it was really my fault. He's really hollering at me not hollering at you. Now this is very simple all we have to do is, uh... It's simpler than you think. Yeah, do you have a boyfriend? - No. - Well you've had one at one time, right? - Right. - You know when you made love to him all the little things that you did and how much fun it was? That's just about what we are going to do here. It's very simple. It's not any special thing you have to do. Just be yourself, and you only need one pussy. - Ok. - And I think you'll love it. I'll teach you everything you have to know. Have you ever sucked cock before? - Yeah. - You did? - Sort of. - A little bit, huh? So it's really very easy. Just sort of like what you did before. Just think about that. - Geez it's so big! - Is it really? - Yeah! - Here why don't you go down on it. Keep it in there. That's it. - It's like sucking an ice cream cone. - See it's alright, isn't it? - Mhmm. - Now do it with, uh... Yeah that's it. A little stronger. Yeah that's it. Just have fun. You see? It's not so fuckin' hard. To do I mean, you just gotta relax. - I think she's got it! By George she's got it! Lance Hardy has risen and so has my salary! Places everyone, get ready for a take. Heat 'em up. Roll sound! Mark. Action! - Tell me. - They are. - They are what? - They are sensitive. - Just think, these were wrapped around that beautiful ass of yours. And this was just hugging... that sweet pussy. Is that on your clit? I don't know it's not on my clit. - Cut! Print it! Alright, great! Sensational! Really fucking sensational! - She's a natural, what can I say? - Hi! - Hi Ginger, come on in. You look great, you want a drink? - Oh, uh, I'll get it. So, um, how's the biggest cock in Hollywood? Your leading man. - That arrogant asshole and I will no longer be working together. I have found a new leading man though. - That won't be easy Linda, the Lance Hardy schlong is legendary. - Oh yeah he's a terrific lover, too bad he's so inconsiderate. - Ah, could this be love? - So did you bring your equipment? - Oh yeah sure. You know I've only done rock stars before. Who is this guy? Is he your new boyfriend? - He's gonna be a big star in the movies. - You mean your kind of movies? Mmm he must really be hung. What's his name? Is he cute? Is he circumcised? - That's him now. - Hi. - Hi! I didn't know you had company. - Oh, Bud Cochran this is Ginger Glover - Hi. - Want something to drink? - Yeah you got a beer? - Sure. Make yourself at home. - How you doing? - Great. He's cute Linda! I think I am going to enjoy casting him. - What does she mean cast me? Does she work for your studio? - She's going to preserve you for posterity. - I don't get it. - Well she's going to make a plaster cast of your cock. - No she isn't. - Oh it won't hurt you'll love it. - You know your a bunch of degenerates you know that don't you? - Yeah. - You got that right. - Let's get his pants off. - Alright. - Now cut it out now this isn't funny. - Oh come on. - Hey this is humiliating to me, alright. We just met. - I'm just going to cast you, not castrate you. - Come one let's get these pants off. - This is sick! - Get in there! - We'll need some water. - This is sick! Degenerate! - I've got some right here. - I know perverted. Have a seat. - What are you gonna do now? - Well lets get his pants off and get him hard. I can't make the casting unless he's good and hard. - Come on now. Look I don't cotton to being made a fool of, alright. No. - You're gonna love this. - Come on you want this. Help me a little bit. - You're wrong alright. - Here let's get this under his ass, I don't want to make a mess. - What are you worried about the furniture? - I'm not worried about a thing, honey. Underwear too, we can't do it through the underwear you know. - I sure hope you don't hurt me. I mean I'm a gentleman at times ma'am... - Oh it is going to be excruciating! You're gonna love it. - Shit. Geez I feel like I am at the dentist. I can never get hard now. Well I might get hard. - It's time to cast this dick. Let's do it. - How am I gonna get this off when it hardens? - Well you can keep it up forever, stud. When you get smaller it will slide right off. I think I'll use bronze so that even when you are gone your mighty organ will remain as in life always ready for another recital. Just give it a couple minutes for the plaster to harden and we are all set. - Ginger, you know, you're a master cock caster. - Thank you. - Now how am I supposed to stay hard with this thing on? - That's a great idea! Now watch closely Cochran, you may never see anything like this again. We're gonna fuck your toes Cochran! - Ooh you give good toe, baby! - Oh Cochran what big toes you have! - I give nice foot massages I'll tell you that. (moaning) - Oh, I'm going to... - No don't move! - It's getting so hard! - Just relax. - I can't! I can't! Oh! - Oh, we'll have to make another casting. You whip up another batch. I'll keep him hard. - How much water do I put in? - Um, put in the plaster first. About a cup. Just eye ball it. - Then how much water? - About half a cup. Then stir it. - It was too tight. Too tight. - Hand me that dildo. - What? - There's a dildo in that bag. Get it for me. Quick! I think it's ready Linda, are you? - Wait, wait a minute! - I got it, it's right here. - Oh! - Well, I guess we are going to have to make him hard again. Ready? - Ms. Hands, sirs. - You two talk, I'm going down to the Nazi sex slave company to see how they are doing. Nice to see you again Linda. - Nice seeing you Mr. Cox. - I love him like a brother, but I sure wish he'd see my tailor. - Bernie, darling... What this studio needs is a... Big, fresh, new cock. Attached to a nice, easy-going, and easy to get along with young man. - And as the sun slowly sinks over the Western horizon we say a not so fond farewell to Lance Hardy. What's his name? - Bud Cochran, well actually it's Longstreet Cochran. - Some screen writer made that up. - No it's for real. - It's too good to be true, uh, ok. Have him here tomorrow morning. We'll shoot a test. - Bernie, darling! Mwah! I know you're really going to be impressed with him. - Ah Linda baby, if only I wasn't happily married to Bertha these 28 years. - Morning Phil. - Ah, Linda. One of the hundred reasons I love you so much is you're always on time. - Oh, so tell me another 50 or 60 reasons. - Linda, my dear, if all my stars were as easy to work with as you are my life would be so much better. - Thanks Phil. - Is, uh, this the new star? - Oh Bud, this is Phil Parker. Now he's directed all of my pictures and he's the very best. - Phil, this is Bud Cochran. - How do you do? - How you doing. - Now I want you to remember that name. He's going to be very big. Of course he's already pretty big. But what I mean to say is that he is going to be well known. Oh and Phil, I just want to tell you how much I appreciate you doing Bud's screen test. Who's he working with? - Ah, you, Ms. uh, come over here I want to introduce you. Linda, Bud this is, uh, what's your name? - Daisy, Daisy Cheney. - Ah, Daisy, this is Ms. Hand. - Oh, Ms. Hand, I've seen all your pictures. You give the greatest head. - Well thank you. - And this is Bud Cochran. You'll be working with Bud today. - Ooh, he's cute! - Well I'm going to leave the three of you to your movie making magic. - Marker. - Ok, now try not to act too nervous now. Ok look right in the lens. Ok now look back at me. And action! - Well Harvey what do you think? I say we let him play the lead with Linda in our next picture. - Yes, yes please say yes. - We still have the unfinished Matinee Idol to deal with. We've got to honor our commitments to our distributors. And deliver them a Lance Hardy, Linda Hand film. - You mean a Linda Hand, Lance Hardy film? Don't you Mr. Cox? - Whatever. - Ok, I'll finish this one film with Lance Hardy, but it's the last I'm ever going to work with him. From now on my leading man is Bud Cochran. - Linda, Linda we'll work something out. I'm sorry Harvey I only... - Bernie they got their brains between their legs. - Harvey they just don't realize the attraction they have for one another. - You know maybe you're right. You know this studio's success is attributable to Lance and Linda together. Well hell they've acted like this towards one another ever since the start. Whatever is between them sure works well on the screen. Don't fool with a winning combination. - Lance Hardy, I'm really glad we had a chance to get together tonight. You know Doris has done some research on what you do, your lifestyle. You know we're not squares, we understand this sort of thing. I think it's terrific. And I know about your relationship with your studio, Sensational International. And that's fine. But I really don't think you are getting the proper edge. What I'm proposing, I think, will blow the lid off the market. And boost your career. - Blow the lid off the market? - Tell him Doris. - You tell him Walter. I'm embarrassed. - She's embarrassed. Lance Hardy's advice to women about sex. - What? - To women about sex. Written by Lance Hardy! - Lance Hardy advice about sex? - For women. - Tell him the clincher Doris - Hard cover. Best Seller. My husband will publish a book that you will write. That gives advice to women about sex. - I think it will make the New York Times best seller list, and probably run for a year. I'm talking something very big. - Yeah? - I think it's sensational. Doris came up with the idea. I'm the publisher, I'm handling the overall package. You know the financing. Doris will work out the details with you. How it's going to work, she'll edit it, the whole thing. Doris do me a favor. Take him home, go over the details with him. Will you do that for him? Show him how it works? You got any questions, no problem. I gotta get out of here. Alright Doris? You'll take him home? - Sure darling. - You look good, you look good. Great. - You've got a nice place here. So, uh, you want me to do a little book, write a book, huh. - Listen Lance, Walter will never find out about this. He could never understand how I really feel about you. Only I understand Lance. I know what you feel. - You know what I feel? - Listen to me Lance, I'm talking about a relationship here. - Mrs. Michaels... - Doris. - Doris, look Doris you don't understand what this business is like. And I'm not really the way you think I am. - I know. I know Lance. So you just relax and stay right here. And don't move. I'm going to slip into something... - More comfortable. - More expressive. - I gotta get out of here. Maybe I'll stay. I mean she's not that bad looking. She's cute, and a good piece of ass maybe. Who the fuck will know? Nah I better go. No this isn't... I'll stay... No. Yeah I'll stay. I'll stay. I'll stay. I'll stay. - Just relax and lie there darling. I'll do everything. - I gotta get out of here. - What a bad sport. Hmph. - With warmest regards... - Sensational International Pictures. - Harvey D. Cox, Chairman of the Board. - Bernard A. Kuntz, President. Thank you Dorothy, that'll be all. - You're welcome sir. - Oh, hi Dorothy how's my favorite secretary? - I'm doing well Mr. Hardy, thank you. - You know you look very... Respectable. - You look well yourself, sir. - Well thank you Mr. Hardy for honoring us with your esteemed presence. - Cut the crap Bernie, get to the point. What did you want to see me about? - We want you to finish Matinee Idol with Linda. - Well what about that other actress we tested? Daisy, uh... What's her name? - Daisy Cheney, yes, her test looked great, just great. But... - But, we've got to recoup our money from Matinee Idol. And the only way to do that is for you and Linda both to finish the picture. - Supposed I agree. Then how are you going to get Linda to go along with this? - We've already talked to Linda, and she's agreed. She's gonna cooperate fully. - And then after Matinee Idol is completed, we can drop Linda and replace her with Daisy in the next film. - Crazy. How do you drop Linda Hand? - We don't need two female stars in one lot. - Now Linda's too old. She's over the hill. - I think your partner is going a little whacky. I think you're crazy! Linda Hand past her prime? She's the best! She can still raise every cock from here to the East Coast. Including a couple of old men that I know. Alright when do you want to resume film? - Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock sharp. So be there. - Oh I'll be there. - I told you Bernie, they've got their brains between their legs. - If you two are ready, I'd uh, like to get started. Places everyone, get ready for a take. Heat em' up. Roll sound. Mark. Action! - You know I was following you all that time, didn't you? Huh? I was watching you. Did you know that? - Yeah I knew it. - You want this cock, don't you? - Oh, yeah, give it to me! - I'm not your husband. You can talk to him that way, but you can't talk to me that way. I give you what I want, when I want it. You understand? You bitch, how does it feel to have a dick in you? - I love it! - That's because your husband doesn't have a cock, right? - Not like yours he doesn't. Fuck me. - I can't fuck you with money. That's what you get off your old man, huh, money. You're such a fucking whore. - You love bitches. - That's why I'm fucking one. - Let's cut and go for a new angle now. - Lance. I just want you to know that I'm really sorry about... You know... - No, no, no there's no reason to apologize. It was my fault. - Well I guess, actually, we both have reason to apologize. - Yeah, I guess. - Ah, it's nice to see you two aren't fighting. Ok ready everybody we are back in business. Places everyone! Get ready for a take. Heat em' up. - Now hold on a second, I, uh... Uh, I'm not hard. Try to get my dick up anyways. You don't mind, do you? - No. - Gotta get back in character. - The camera is just on your faces. Can't we get this thing shot? - Hey I'm gonna tell you something. I've got to be inside her, alright? - It's alright Lance we're holding. - I do this soft core stuff it's ok, I don't want to pretend. I want to feel it. - If we don't start soon we will be into over time, Lance. - You know sometimes your... - It's ok. - Don't get me upset, alright? Jesus. - Roll sound. Mark. Action! - I love your big dick. Fuck me. Turn me over. - What? - Turn me over. I want you to see my ass. You like that? Just pull it down, come on. You got it. Fuck me! Oh, I want your big dick! Fuck me! Fuck me! Grab my ass! Grab it! Fuck me! - And cut! Beautiful! Beautiful! Wrap for the day! - Hey! How about dinner sometime? - Really? I'd like that. - Hey nice place you have. - You know I don't think I've ever been happier, Lance. - Yeah? Is that before or after you locked me out of the house? - Would you like a drink? - I'd love one, thanks. You know you made Daisy and Bud very happy too. If it wasn't for you they'd never have met. - If it wasn't for you they would have never met. - You need to tell me something, uh... You think, uh... You think you could marry me? - No. - A hard man is good to find. - But you didn't let me finish. What I meant to say is, why do you want to marry me? - Ah, let me see. This might take a while. If you say yes, I'll spend the rest of our lives telling you why. - You know this is the first time we are alone together. - Mr. and Mrs. Cochran. By the power vested in me, by the state of California. I pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. - And Mr. Hardy and Ms. Hand, I just want to tell you how much my wife and I enjoy watching your films. - Thank you your honor. - Thanks you. Thank you very much. Bud congratulations! - Thank you Mr. Hardy. - Thank you so much. - Daisy, congratulations. - Thanks Lance. - Very best of luck to you both. - Thank you, thank you, sir. - Bye, bye. Have a safe trip! - So long! - So you got married? I'll send you a wedding gift. Who? Daisy? I thought you and Linda, she... You what?! She what?! - You and who? I thought you were sweet on what's her name? Linda's what? Come on Lance quit kidding. You're what? Hello? Hello? - They quit, both of them, all of them. - What do we do Bernie? - Some where in this star struck town there's gotta be another guy with a big cock, a pretty face, able to cum on que. You, fella. You out there. How about you? You want to be a Matinee Idol?
