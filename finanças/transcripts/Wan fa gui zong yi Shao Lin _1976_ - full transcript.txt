- Hyah! Hyah! Ho. (triumphant music) (suspenseful music) - [Gu Chung] My greetings, your highness, most humbly given. - You may rise. Get out of here. - [Both] Sir. - I died. The master of chung wu claimed I was hanged and that the premier. Perhaps so, for the only proof is not here but at Kong Nam. So now only two people know who I am. Gong Fei and Fong Lo. Gu Chung. - [Gu Chung] Yes sir? - [Chien] We go to Kong Nam. - [Gu Chung] Yes. (adventurous music) - We must return immediately. Hyah! - Those two guys look suspicious. We'd better check them out. Come on. - I remember the old premier greeted me everyday. If it's true that he was indeed my real father, then I've been most neglectful in my duty to him as a son. - That's not so. How can you be to blame? No sir, if you were truly unaware of it. - Anyway, he was a great and good man. Now he's dead. I should pay respect. Gu Chung. - Yes, sir? - [Chien] Some incense. (traditional Chinese music) - Gu Chung. - [Gu Chung] Sir. - [Gu Chung] Good men, what have we done to you that you should want to kill us? - Who are you two? How dare you come here? Fight! (men groaning) (agonized moans) - Eagle's claw. (bones cracking) This eagle's claw. - So, the eagle's claw. - The shaolin trainer, Gu Chung, has a job as Chien Lung's bodyguard. What's he doing at the site of the premier's grave? - Maybe Chien Lung already knows he's Han. If he's really here then it's of the utmost concern to us all. - Second master, third master, please wait. Young master isn't here. - The young master isn't here but we have little time. Now where do you think they'll be staying the night? - Probably out at the summer palace. - Backtin. - Yeah? - [Man in white] Check the place out. - [Backtin] Right. (crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) - There are many outlaws here so stay on your guard. I mustn't be kidnapped. - I've given orders already. The men are on alert. - Hm? - It's late now. Please sir, it's about time you went to sleep. (yawns) How dare you? Come here without permission? What is it you want? - You're a traitor. You're working for the Qing, you're their dog. I don't have to talk with you. - Shut up. Both of you. You must want to die badly. - We are not afraid of death! That is why we have come! Huh, proud wings. You won't escape. (weapons clashing) Kung Fei. This is a diversion. We'd better get back to the king. - You fool! If those two men were really Fung Lung and Kung Fei, why did you let them get away from you? - Please forgive me. - Sire, accept our apologies for being late. - Well get after them now! Search for them everywhere! Wait! - My lord. - Remember this. One, don't make a disturbance. Two, make the search in secret. And three, I want them taken alive. - Young master, do you think the man you met in the boat could possibly be the emperor? - Chien Lung? - Young master, you and miss Chang have just returned from a long journey. There is something I must tell you. - Well, what is it? - Just before the old master died, he told me one thing. Chien Lung is a Han. - That's means you and he are related. - What? Are you quite sure? - That is why he has come here and why he keeps it so secret. He plans to have you killed. - Maybe Chien Lung already knows he's Han. When the old master was still alive, twice he went to the palace to tell Chien Lung to kick out the Qing. - This is important news so we have to consider it carefully. - But there are urgent things that we have to do. First of all, we must find a way for you two to meet. You must have a talk with him. - I'm afraid we failed in our assassination attempt so we have to try another tact. The two brothers must have a meeting. - No. It might not work out well. - Wait, I've got an idea. - What's that? - Tell us then. - [Woman] My beautiful girls. (playing lute) - [Woman] Come on, give him more drinks. The gentlemen will tip you well. Come on, look lively. Have another drink, sir. Drink up. - Hey. This is a secret door to the Chao Shang's cellar. - Come on. - Mister, is there anything else you want? - So I see. That little thing attracts you, does she? Chao Hun, help pour the wine. Come on. - Here. - Hey. - Fill his glass, that's the idea. Are you enjoying yourself? We keep a good table. We're famous for it. (laughing) - Good. Good. Good. Hey, you, come here. Come here. - Right, right, right. Hova, come and sit beside the gentleman. Chao Hun, you let her through. Hova, the gentleman seems to be crazy about you. Quickly serve him him some of the wine. Be careful now. - [Chien Lung] Good. - Come and have a drink with him. - Hova, you're a very lucky girl today. Out of all the girl's here he's decided to pick you. Tonight you're special. Since you clearly like Hova so much, perhaps you should taste her. Please have some more wine. You're looking after the gentleman well. (laughing) - Here. - Good. - Hova, hurry. Keep filling up his cup. - [Hova] That's right more, drink some more sir. - [Chien] It's good. - There. - Right, drink some more. Enjoy yourself. (laughing) - Right. Right. - Go ahead drink some more. You better get ready for bed, sir. Please take a rest. - [Chien] Come on. - Master. - [Chien] Huh? - It's late now, please go home. - Help the gentleman to his room now. Hurry up! Go on! - Good night sir. Good night. This way. - Mister, I'll look after you. Come on. - I see it. Come on. - [Chien] Hova. Hova. - To help him rebuild the Han dynasty I've got to do this to him. - Come here. Come here. Hova. - Mister. (laughing) (clothes rips) (thunder crashes) (laughing) - Come on. Come on. Come on, please let me help you. There. (adventurous music) - Hold it. There's a noise behind us. Someone is after us. - I think it must be Gu Chung. Lao Tin! - What's wrong? Lao Tin, get them out of here quickly. - Right. Come on. - So, it's you two again. Where have you taken the emperor? If you bring him back now I'll forget this happened. (thunder crashes) - Brother, we have scared you. I meant no harm. I hope someday you'll forgive me for what I've done. - My lord, please go and change your clothes. - Who's the girl? - Princess Chang. From the outer provinces and she's engaged to be married to our master. - It was not too easy bringing you out here. - What are these? - These are the robes of Ming. They are the emperor's clothes. - Right. You and I both have the same father. We are brothers by blood. - You're a liar. You don't have my blood. - I am your brother. You know that it's true so why do you deny it? You are a Han, why do you stay with the Qing people? - You have kidnapped me. What is it you want? - Please brother, you must help to rebuild the Han empire. - What are you talking about when you say I'm Han? That I'm your brother? Do you have any proof? - Yes. - Where is it? - Within three days I'll bring you the proof. - Really? - I keep my word. - Then if you can bring me the proof, I will-- - You'll what? - I will swear in God's name to rebuild the Han empire for you. - Alright, it's a deal. I'll leave here immediately. Hyah! Hyah! (exciting music) - Danger is imminent. (soothing chanting music) - All praise to God. You do not bow and pray, place no incense, pay no respect. What do you want? - I have something important for the abbot. - Mister, do you know the rule of our temple? - Please tell me the rule. - Mister, you must first pass the test. - Two steps. Transverse. Eight forward. (screaming) (yelling) - [All] All praise to God. (fast paced music) - I have something, it's most important. I have to discuss it with the abbot. - You dare to enter our temple. - Aren't you afraid? You know the rule of our temple. You must fight! - Right. Pole stroke. (groaning) - Please sir, please go back. - [All] All praise to God. - For the Han Empire I have to go through with this fight. - You are fortunate to have come this far. If you want to continue there is one more fight. I must warn you it will be the most dangerous yet. - [All] All praise to God. - Thank you for allowing me to pass. (adventurous music) If the abbot won't see me, I'll have to take the proof myself. - Who are you that dare to enter here? - I've come here to see the abbot. - It's not so easy. - [All] All praise to God. - So, at last you're here. All praise to God. - [Voiceover] All gong fu comes from shaolin. (epic music) - [Abbot] Begone. Stay away. Wait a moment, is your family named Chan? - Yes venerable master, Chan Gaolo. - I see. Since you have fought so hard to come so far you must be looking for the proof on Chien Lung. - Yes. - This concerns the future of China for good or bad. If you can fight me through all the 12 stages of Shaolin gong fu then you will be worthy of knowing the truth and may come inside. - Good. Then it is agreed. - Snakewall. Tiger claw. Bird's beak. Nervous system. Now the panda. Heartbeat. Monkey's paw. Hard breathing point. Please sir, go back now. Bear claw. Phoenix. Dragon's style. Shark's fin. The 12 styles of gong fu, now you've learnt 11. Eagle claw. Thank God, thank God you are strong enough to withstand all my blows. Thank God. Please. - Thank you very much. - [Abbot] Wait a moment. - Abbot? I must fight more? - Listen, those 12 styles that I just used against you. Did you understand them all? - Yes abbot, I understood them. - You fought three times before you came. The wooden men will test what you have learned. Now sir, if you do meet the traitor Gu Chung you can defend yourself against his eagle claw. - Now I have no fear. (calming music) One snake, five birds and six animals, these are the 12 basic stars of Shaolin gung fu. (swords clanking) - [All] You may now go. - Thank you. (tense music) (nunchakus flailing) - [All] You may now go. - Thank you very much. (bell tolling) Thanks for all of your help. My thanks to the abbot. - The Han empire depends on you. - Yes. - You should go. - [Man] Goodbye master. - [Chien] Mr. Chu Sikung, this man brings with him my infant, Chung. - This was written by our mother. This letter from her is absolute proof how you and the princess escaped. - Then I really am a Han and he really is my blood brother. Even so, he is against the Qing. - Brother. Come now, we can trust eachother, can't we? - As an emperor I keep my word. I will rebuild the Han dynasty. But first you will have to promise me two things. - Name it, if I can do it for you. - At the moment empress is Qing. She will retire. The princess Chang, who is charming, must replace her as my queen. Despite the fact she's your fiance. Do you agree to this? - But. - But what? - Yes I promise you. - (laughing) I'll rule with a firm hand. Tomorrow we go to father's grave. (playing guqin) - I think, princess Chang, you better come with me. - It's an attack! (arrows flying) (swords clinking) (woman screaming) (nunchaku flailing) (rope twirling) (tense music) (moaning) (yelling) (screaming) (groaning) - Chung Yi Wu is utterly destroyed. - Why? Why you have broken your promise? (laughing) - If I were not now the emperor of the Qing, why do my people enjoy such a peaceful life? (horses trotting) (fast paced music) Go! (upbeat music)
