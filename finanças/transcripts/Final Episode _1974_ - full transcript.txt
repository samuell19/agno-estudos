TOEl COMPANY PRESENTS The yakuza battles in Hiroshima that began during the black-market period following the end of World War II in 1945 grew into all-out gang warfare in the summer of 1963, resulting in 17 dead, 26 seriously wounded, and more than 1,600 arrests. This third round of gangland violence brought a tremendous outcry from the public, and a police crackdown finally began to take hold in 1964. The Uchimoto family disbanded, SHOZO HIRONO HEAD OF HIRONO FAMILY IN KURE and its leading under boss, Shozo Hirono, was sentenced to seven years in Abashiri prison. Meanwhile, in the opposing Yamamori camp, Chief Under boss Akira Takeda was released on a technicality, and he called on families around the Hiroshima region to unite, shed the image of gangsters, and drastically alter the nature of their organizations by reconstituting themselves as a political body, the Tensei Coalition. In spite of its new political status, however, this body, too, became the cause of further bloodshed.

You been at some grade-school field day? - Didn?t you hear? - We were on a march with Tensei That's good of you It's only to give the big shots some exposure The chairman probably wants to run for the prefectural assembly Hey, look who's here Who are they? Some of Hirono's men Having yourselves a good time, I see, while your boss is off in Abashiri eating prison swill! Whoa, did I hit a sore spot? Hurry up with the beer! What do we owe you? That's Yen2,000 You leaving? Thanks - You asking for trouble? - You should place it more carefully! Watch your mouth, asshole! Hurry! Go get Mr. Matsumura! Please stop! Break it up! I said break it up! Doesn't look too bad Help him up I suggest you be a little more careful It's a bit too soon for you guys to be fooling around in Hiroshima Sorry about the mess I'll take care of the damage Didn?t anybody listen to the new coalition rules? If you ask me, the fucks who started this fight should all be ordered to cutoff a finger We may have a fancy new name, but our troops are a bunch of riffraff You got to chop off an arm or two if you want discipline! I agree We?ve got to clamp down hard Young recruits these days are a bunch of softies Where do you stand on this, Chairman? Matsumura's in charge of troop discipline I'm against punishments like cutting off fingers or arms We formed the Tensei Coalition to distance ourselves from the yakuza image I think we need to avoid practices identified with yakuza That stands to reason I agree 100 percent How about we leave this matter to Matsumura? Not so fast! You wanna turn them into spineless wimps? How about we take a vote? All right Those in favor of leaving it to Matsumura Hear, hear That's exactly half, and I'll add my vote Matsumura, let us know what you decide before the day is out Next item on the agenda HEAD OF ICHIOKA FAMILY IN KURE TERUKICHI ICHIOKA HIRONO & CO HIRONO FAMILYCAPTAIN ATSUSHI UJIIE Welcome, Boss Ichioka Come on in Hey, pop a couple beers Ujiie I hear some of your young men got diced up by Matsumura's men I told them to stay out of Hiroshima, but some just don't listen Is that anyway to hold the fort while your boss is away? Why didn?t you hit them right back? The fault was ours Who gives a fuck whose fault it was? You hear Tensei, and suddenly you're all chicken shit Where's your balls? Perhaps you're not aware of our situation, because you just got out of the joint If you're so afraid of tangling with Tensei because they might bust you up, why not just go bowing and scraping and ask them to take you in? We have to be careful until the boss gets out Fucking wimps! Your boss is weeping in Abashiri Look a strong offense is your best defense It's payback time Just watch I'll light the fires for you! So don't be chicken shits! If any of those Tensei assholes come to Kure, give them what they deserve! The same old Ichioka I hear some people say that's the way a gangster ought to be He acts like everything's the same as ten years ago Fuck that shit! MAY 23, 1966 TAKEYA DISTRICT, HIROSHIMA Sugita! MAY 23, 1966,TENSEl COALITION ASSOCIATE SAKICHI SUGITA DIED Tensei associate Sakichi Sugita had run an underground loan operation. He had served as financial advisor to Tensei president Takeda and had been an important source of funds. - My condolences - Thank you Please come with me Ichioka must be behind this He's said all along he'd pick a fight with Tensei Better hold your tongue, Otomo, until we really know If you sit around doing nothing, it'll be your turn next Ichioka's not one to hold back We've got to go after him before he comes after us FORMER HEAD OF YAMAMORI FAMILY YOSHIO YAMAMORI Get a load of that ass Is that the widowed daughter Tamotsu's making it with? That's right Her husband died in a car wreck soon after they got married She's been handling the books for Sugita Enterprises ever since A real looker, isn?t she? She's a fine, fine You're drooling, boss Am I? Better watch out Everything's set for tomorrow I really appreciate all your help I know how worn out you must be Just leave everything to us That's what the chairman said, too What do you think, Tamotsu? Was it really Ichioka? It's hard to say yet, but one of the witnesses did say he recognized Ichioka's thugs I see Chief I thought I might be early, but I came to offer up some incense You must be his daughter I'd like to offer my condolences Please don't lose heart Thank you for making time in your busy schedule Please come in Thanks SHOZO HIRONO TERUKICHI ICHIOKA Ichioka! You've got some nerve coming here! Cough it up! You ordered the hit, didn?t you? Mr. Otomo! I know it was you! It couldn?t be anyone else! Careful, Otomo! I suggest you watch your tongue! Calm down, boss! You wanna fight? If that's what you want, just say so - I'm ready for you anytime! - That does it! Settle down! Ichioka you've had your chance to offer incense Now get out of here You know, Mr. Takeda, with crazies like him running around, I'd say your coalition's days are numbered Boss! Hold him! - No, boss! Don't! - Let go of me! You take me for a fool? Don?t you know who I am? I've been slicing and dicing on the streets since you were knee-high! Put the fucking bullets back in and give it to me! I'll teach you! - Did you get enough? - You Take it easy, Mr. Otomo! That's enough! Apologize! Mr. Otomo, please accept his apology Look, Takeda, those bastards came here to pick a fight! You want us to just sit around jacking off? This is no time to be getting into fights As vice chairman, you need to stop and think before you go off half-cocked It's only been two years since we formed this coalition, and we've finally started to alter public perception Just one bullet could send all that down the drain! So you finally show your true colors Very well I'll take on Ichioka by myself! I'll show you how a real yakuza defends his pride! Ah, what stirring valor! You're truly a man among men! Today's youngsters should take a page from your book A paragon of yakuza chivalry Let me make one thing clear If anybody here responds to Ichioka's provocations, he's finished with Tensei Keep that in mind In June 1966, the Hiroshima police and district attorney's office made note of the rising discord within Tensei and took out a warrant to search the group's offices on suspicion of illegal gun trafficking. Fearing the outbreak of a fourth bloody gangland feud, the police determined to break up the Tensei Coalition by arresting Takeda and the group's other leaders. Found them! TENSEl OFFICES SEARCHED 24 HANDGUNS FOUND All right! What's the matter, honey? Have you gone nuts? They're putting the screws on Takeda This says it's only a matter of time before he's arrested That means I can get the chairmanship back! I get to be Hiroshima's big boss again! Then will you buy me an Omega watch? Of course I will Come here, Mitsuko Damn it! Be more careful! What you think you're doing? Boss, Mr. Hayakawa is here It's time to get going, Otomo Hurry up and get ready I'm not going Just looking at that horse's ass makes me sick I'll send Mano instead That's not a good idea You don't want to miss this emergency meeting Takeda intends to name his successor What? If the cops grab Takeda, we'll need an acting chairman Takeda wants to name Matsumura, but it's so sudden, he hasn't had time to firm up support Look, Otomo This is your chance to become king of the hill I called this meeting today because now that I've been chairman for a year, I think it's time we decide who'll be next in line And to make sure we don't have disagreements later over what we decide today, I've asked Mr. Okubo and Mr. Kono to join us Gentlemen after considering the matter carefully, I'm recommending Managing Director Tamotsu Matsumura, as the next chairman of Tensei I'd like to move directly to a vote Hold on, Mr. Chairman I object Both for his stature and the respect he commands, I think Vice Chairman Otomo is the best candidate I know Mr. Otomo would normally be the logical choice But the thing is, he brings a lot of baggage with him from before If we consider what the public and the police will think, I don?t think he's the best man to represent us publicly This wasn?t an easy decision for me, but I hope you'll all understand why I decided as I did Don?t you think Matsumura's awfully young for this? If you ask me, Matsumura's the perfect choice Takeda's not saying we should make Matsumura chairman right away He's only going to be chairman-elect Unlike the rest of us, Matsumura is a child of the times He's the man who can lead our coalition into the future For his age, he's shown himself to be of very sound character, and if we all rally around him, he'll do a fine job of leading us Very well said, sir When you put it that way, I'd have to say Matsumura has my wholehearted support How about we take a vote? Our choice is between Mr. Otomo and Matsumura All right, we'll take a vote Those in favor of Matsumura, raise your hands It had all been scripted in advance by Takeda and Okubo. Takeda was determined to build Tensei into a new kind of yakuza organization. By naming his trusted confidant Matsumura as his successor, he had successfully weathered this challenge to his vision. Come on, Matsumura Shake the chairman's hand Don't just sit there Listen, everyone If anything should happen to me, I want you to rally behind Matsumura and keep building the coalition We've only barely firmed up our foundation, and we're in heavy debt both to our members and to society I'll be leaving Matsumura with a tremendous burden Matsumura, it's not going to be easy, but I'm counting on you Gentlemen, I look forward to your support What a charade! That same night, Takeda was taken into custody on charges of smuggling and illegal possession of handguns. What's going to happen to the Tensei Coalition now? When will you announce your retirement? I don't intend to retire, nor will I disband Tensei So you're passing the reins to a successor? I didn?t say that Who's going to be chairman? The police claim Tensei is a yakuza group What do you say to that? Tensei is not a yakuza group It's a political coalition Remember that, Tamotsu I'm counting on you All right I'll take care of it right away What the hell's going on with these people? The minute Takeda gets nabbed, they all go soft on us Those assholes Otomo and Hayakawa are stirring them up, spreading mud and vicious lies They're driving me crazy! Same here Kuwa in Tokuyama called, wondering if this might be a good time to quit the coalition! Fucking idiot! Tamotsu, we need to do something pretty quick, or the coalition's gonna start falling apart We could lose everything we've been working for Chief Sorry to take so long It's good of you to come Well, if it isn't Miss Sugita I was so grateful for everybody's help at the services We all admire how you stepped right into your father?s shoes and carried on the business I've divided these up Securities, liabilities, and these are bond certificates and pledges What's all this stuff? Financial documents Chairman Takeda had entrusted to Mr. Sugita All his assets, essentially But he said he had nothing but debts Don't forget what he always said: You borrow in order to distribute favors I see So the big man had figured on that from the start? He really doesn?t miss a beat This looks like a list of gambling loans My name's not there, is it? Man, I'm breaking out in a cold sweat It's time for a showdown Eda, Tsuneoka, I'll need your help too Doing what? Making money talk We'll rake this money together and slap them all in the face with it Slap who in the face? I'm not under any illusions I know too well that I'll have to struggle for control of the coalition That's why I said it's time for a showdown Just you watch You should go have a soak, too I already did I heard it really was some Ichioka men that did it that killed my father I hear they got picked up in Osaka That's what I heard, too I suppose Ichioka himself will still get off scot-free Let's go to bed Tamotsu, I'm thinking of giving up the business Why would you do that? I've been thinking about my father He didn't particularly like being a yakuza banker Then, after doing your people's bidding all those years, he gets snuffed out like some insect Of course, you'll say it wasn't your fault, but I just don't have it in me to work for you anymore I can't have you quit now I need your help now more than ever So I don?t want to hear any more talk like that, okay? I've even been thinking we should get married, you know You never think of anyone but yourself, do you? Please! Don?t make me stay tonight Listen to me. You may think I'm not doing right by your father, but even if it had been my own father, I couldn't just flip out and gun the bastards down Don't! Just be patient When the time comes, I'll avenge your father All right? Please come again What the hell's going on? What the fuck? It's Kanazawa! Bro! I've got Kanazawa, from the Otomo family Tie him up! Chief! We've got them both, chief! Chief! Are you hurt? You were fucking napping on the job! Sorry, chief! They're Otomo men What should we do with them? With all the ruckus, the cops should be here any minute Just dump them out front It's amazing how hard it is to hit something with a bullet ABASHIRI PRISON, HOKKAIDO Shozo Hirono was in the final year of his seven-year sentence. In a prison memoir, he wrote up a candid account of the events that had brought him there, and he closed with the following, addressed to no one in particular: "When foolish men stand at the top, the men under them suffer and shed blood needlessly." Hirono, did you say you were having stomach trouble? I'll take you to the infirmary You have a visitor Bro! Ichioka! How long you been out? About six months I wanted to come right away, but it took some time You're looking well I'm managing So, how is everyone? Pretty much the same So long as I'm there, I'll make sure everyone's taken care of, so don?t worry about that Yeah, thanks I don't have much time, so I'll get right to the point A couple of Otomo's men turned their guns on Matsumura Matsumura escaped unharmed, but it's really shaken up the coalition Otomo's being investigated for inciting murder, but he'll be out on bail soon At any rate, the group's split clean in two, and Hiroshima's got a war on its hands This is your big chance to take Hiroshima for yourself I'll lay the groundwork between now and when you get out, so you can be looking forward to a jolly good time What? Something wrong? I was just remembering the past It's kind of depressing to think of other guys having to go through what I've been through Don't give me that, bro We've got plenty of young recruits just itching for a fight We're not gonna come up short on ammunition They have no idea what it takes to clean things up after a fight Those of us who do need to let them know That doesn?t sound very much like you, bro I think you've caught the big-house sickness Time's up Well, I'll be going Look, Ichioka Don?t worry, bro A little outside air and you'll get your old self back Don?t worry about a thing Don?t worry In the fall of 1968, Otomo was released on bail. Despite everything, acting Tensei chairman Matsumura, allowed him to return as vice chairman of the coalition. There was widespread derision of Matsumura's weak-kneed decision, and the Otomo faction grew cockier than ever. There it is Pull over It's their grand opening today They invited us, and especially wanted you to come Whose place is it? You'll see in a minute Welcome My name's Hayakawa He's waiting for you in back Aren?t you an eyeful Right this way, please Welcome, Mr. Otomo Come right on in Hayakawa, what the hell's this about? Now, now, I'm sorry I kept you in the dark, but Mr. Ichioka insisted on seeing you I'm leaving Wait! Excuse me, but the boss has a bad liver The doctor's told him not to drink We have to go He's got something important to discuss with you Thirty minutes is all it'll take Please sit down Please You must Why should I listen to anything this asshole has to say? Don't get so hot under the collar, Mr. Otomo We can fight anytime we want, but we don?t often get to share a drink This could even be our first and last time Let go You think you're so smart All right I'll drink with you Come right on in Yo! Ichioka! I've got a score to settle with you That wobbly-kneed Takeda punk stopped me, but you escaped me killing you by the skin of your teeth! - You realize that? - Right, I owe you one And Mr. Otomo, I'd like to repay that debt now I suggest you choose your words carefully I think no more of killing a man than yanking a rotten tooth That's exactly why, I thought I'd put my life in your hands Mr. Ichioka is saying he wants to exchange vows of brotherhood with you The fuck! Look, Mr. Otomo I have great respect for you Hiroshima's crawling with yakuza, but only a handful are the real thing I'd be happy to become brothers with you Bro, Mr. Ichioka's a resolute man just like yourself Why don?t you take him up on this? Hayakawa! Did you and Ichioka cook up this scheme together? I see right through you! It must be your imagination The fuck it is! What you two really want is to pick a fight with Matsumura If you want a marriage of convenience, then why not just say so? You got me there Mr. Otomo even if it is a marriage of convenience, I don't imagine you have any objection to taking Matsumura down If this marriage can benefit us both, why not go along with it? Fine, Ichioka But aren't you taking the vows of brotherhood too fucking lightly? Even cow shit has different grades, you know Are you saying you and I are equals? Don't insult me! The following day, Otomo and Ichioka exchanged vows of brotherhood. All who heard of the match doubted their ears. Just a moment, please Boss This time it's Matsumura himself Perhaps you should take the call Pesky bugger Why should he care who I exchange vows with? Tell him if he doesn't like it, he can just expel me - But, boss - Do it! It'd be a mistake to underestimate Matsumura He's been keeping it cool lately, but he used to be a real fireball When did you fucking become Matsumura's whore? Let go of me! If you're so smitten with Matsumura, go swear loyalty to him! Sorry to keep you waiting, but the boss is a bit under the weather right now He says he'll stop by headquarters when he's better All right Then maybe you can come instead 8:00 pm atom?s Sushi You know, Mr. Makihara, you really got out at a good time We've got a viper and a python poised to strike together, HEAD OF MAKIHARA FAMILY IN KURE MASAKICHI MAKIHARA (NEWLY PAROLED) So we've got to strengthen our guard It's a real relief to have you back We're counting on you Good-bye Sorry to keep you waiting I think I better be going I have several more stops to make Mr. Makihara, I'll be very grateful for your help Don?t mention it Mr. Makihara, we'll be throwing a big welcome-home party for you soon - Very kind of you - Lots of sexy broads See him to the door Tamotsu that Makihara bastard's always looking for the best deal We can?t trust him I'll put a tail on him That shitface Eda has turned himself completely into Matsumura's whore Spends all his time kissing Matsumura's ass There's plenty of guys hopping-mad about it, so one option would be to declare war But it'd be a shame to break up the coalition So we have a plan At the next council meeting, I'm gonna make a motion for a vote of no confidence We'd like you to second it Once Mr. Otomo becomes chairman, we'll make you vice chairman And Takeda? What about him? He's got two more years of time to serve He's not an issue I'll think about it Hold on, Makihara! We've laid all our cards on the table We need an answer now Look, Mr. Otomo This is Kure's own Masakichi Makihara you're talking to, and I have a hard-earned reputation to uphold You think I'd sit idly by while that pimply-faced Matsumura plays high and mighty? Mano I understand you're brothers with Kubota in Hayakawa's family I want you to tell him what I just told you And I say it not just for you and Kubota, but for everyone I think a lot of our guys are chafing under Otomo and Hayakawa's ways For one thing, they're a whole different generation They just don?t think the way we do So spread the word, will you? Here's something for your trouble But this is a lot of money! Just take it If it's not enough, I'll get you whatever you need Tamotsu, just as I suspected That horse's ass Makihara went to see Otomo and Hayakawa We've got to move quick That same night, Matsumura and Eda slipped quietly into Kure and paid Makihara a visit. Holy shit! Tensei's Matsumura just went into Makihara's office! Matsumura? That's them, all right Let's hit them, bro - Who's got some hardware? - Bro! That's not worth shit, you dufus We need firepower There's that shotgun back at the office - How about a spear gun, bro? - Spear gun? My brother-in-law has one It's got real power - They live around the corner - Good! Go get it! Go with him, Tadashi! What exactly is this? A homecoming gift A contract for work It gives you the rights to Kure Industries' scrap metal, and to supply labor for Muto Trucking They're both under contract to us for the next two years You just got out of the joint and maybe want to rest up, but this would let you start easing back into things It's a very generous gift, Mr. Makihara They're both first-rate companies You can probably expect Yen2 mil a month So then, what is it you want me to do? Oh, no, it's nothing like that Maybe it sounds presumptuous, but I'd just like your support, working for the good of the coalition That's all All right What the hell kept you? They could come out any minute! Pull this trigger and the spear shoots out You do it, Akio Comes a time when we all have to put it on the line for the boss Right? I'll do it! Akio knows how to handle it! Be a man, Akio Here they come! Watch your back, Tamotsu Otomo's a crafty son-of-a-bitch Go! I said go! Yo, what's the matter? This is a spear gun The fucking idiot shot himself in the foot! Chief! This is one of Hirono's dimwits! What? I think he was gunning for Matsumura On your feet! Who sent you here with this spear gun? Spit it out and we'll take you to a doctor! Who sent you? Fucking bastards! Chief! This punk's one of Hirono's men too! Want us to work him over? Never mind Let them go! - Shitheads! - Fucking assholes! Next time it'll be your lives! SEPTEMBER 15, 1969 NEAR NAGAREKAWA IN HIROSHIMA Several days later, Ichioka learned of the Matsumura-Makihara alliance. He headed straight for Hiroshima to take back the initiative. Scatter into the shops around here and have yourselves some fun Break out the Napoleon! A bottle for each of us! Open up! Isn?t anybody home? Isn?t anybody home? Anybody! Mr. Otomo's here, boss Thanks for coming, bro - Take a load off - Welcome You're kicking up quite a ruckus, bro How many men you got out there? 50 or 60 They're scattered all over, so I don't really know You really are a reckless fuck Are they packing heat? Nah, just throwing their weight around They'll keep at it till that candy-ass Matsumura comes out to fight If you hear anything, bro, I'm counting on you The problem is, Matsumura's away at the moment Isn't that what you said, Mano? I heard he went to Osaka on business The fuck! That sure throws cold water on my party Guess your timing?s a bit off Bro! I feel like getting drunk all over Come on Suzue, you come too How about we go to Mon Ch?ri? Nah, I know a place just up the street They're coming out Otomo's with them They're heading toward Yagenbori All right That's where Otomo's woman runs a club called Tazu Circle on ahead Be seeing ya, bro! Boss, you need to get in the car! Please get in the car! Get him home safely Thank you Thank you so much Please come again Take care Ichioka! Darling! Someone, help! Boss! Don't! Let go of me! SEPTEMBER 15, 1969 TERUKICHI ICHIOKA DIED The incident was more than ample warning to the anti-Matsumura faction. Meanwhile, Otomo had determined to avenge Ichioka's death and asked for help from Hayakawa and Makihara, but neither of them responded. Boss! I have a message from Chief Mano! What'd he say? Isn't he coming? Let me see that! Throw it away Tear it up and throw it away TO KATSUTOSHI OTOMO Otomo's own captain, Toyoaki Mano, had declared he could no longer support Otomo, and had gone over to the Matsumura side. Don?t try to resist! Let go of me! SEPTEMBER 16, 1969, KATSUTOSHI OTOMO ARRESTED-SENTENCED TO SIX YEARS Ichioka's death followed by Otomo's arrest dealt a fatal blow to the anti-Matsumura forces. But the police also took Matsumura into custody and began an investigation into the recurring gangland killings. Spill it, Matsumura You ordered the hit on Ichioka, didn?t you? Don?t make this harder than it has to be We've been watching, waiting for you to show your true colors No matter how you deny it, we've got your number Fine! Sit there like a rock if you want! We're fully prepared for a long siege! We'll bring you in as often as it takes to make you come clean You call yourselves a political group and talk about community service, but yakuza are yakuza, and murderers are murderers! Count on it, Matsumura I'm gonna have you hanged You and Tensei are going down together! Welcome back, Mr. Matsumura Come on, everyone Let's hear some banzais What're you standing way back here for? Come on! That day, Matsumura held an emergency council meeting and pushed through two explosive reforms. He declared to the Hiroshima board of elections that the Tensei Coalition was renouncing its political status, and he demanded that all members of the coalition take new vows of loyalty to himself. As a result, the former council members became under bosses, and their captains as well as all their henchmen all swore direct loyalty to Matsumura. Predictably, these reforms met with resistance, but the powers of persuasion of Matsumura's trusted aides, Eda and Mano, ultimately brought everybody into line. The one exception was Hideo Hayakawa, who announced his withdrawal from the Tensei Coalition and appeared at police headquarters to formally declare his retirement and the disbanding of his family. We hope you'll work with us now for the betterment of Hiroshima as a law-abiding member of our community I indeed look forward to working with you Thank you very much, chief Thank you all Law-abiding citizen, huh? Time to rewrite the chart again We should be glad for every name we can erase Except that it's all a charade We've received word that his under boss, Kubota, has formed a new family and applied for Tensei membership On top of that, Kubota's assistant, Kaga, has exchanged vows of brotherhood with Mochizuki of the Shinpu Group Isn't Shinpu affiliated with the Akashi family? I thought Akashi and Tensei were sworn enemies That's right He's got an exit strategy come what may That's how Hayakawa likes to operate So it's still business as usual for him We'll have to be on our toes Just come with us You'll be glad you did You got balls, don?t you? Stop being a sissy! What's going on? We brought you some new recruits They say they want to join the family Come here Step forward! Did you guys volunteer to join up? Stop shivering in your shoes and speak up They said if we didn't join, they'd pound us to pulp It's been a tough time for the family lately, especially since Boss Ichioka got killed Makihara's punks have been swaggering around like they own Kure We figured we needed all the help we could get Chief! Idiots! You lamebrains aren?t even full members yet yourselves! Pull something like this again and I'll kick you out myself! You fellas can go now Go home You guys need to keep a closer eye on your juniors Chief, we feel pretty much the same as those guys do What's that? The shape we're in now, how're we gonna face the boss when he gets back? Even a foot soldier has his pride If we don't start standing up for ourselves, we?ll just be laughingstocks I understand how you feel, but until Takeda gets out, we just have to wait and see The question is what attitude Takeda takes toward our boss I won't be sitting still if I don't like what I see Meanwhile, concerns about Takeda's release from prison were roiling within the Tensei Coalition as well. Doesn't it get your goat, Tamotsu? - Excuse me - You shouldn't have, Mrs. Matsumura Please help yourself Think of all you?ve done to strengthen the coalition If it were me, I couldn't just hand the chairmanship back not even to Boss Takeda How about if you appoint Boss Kono as your successor before Takeda gets out? I don?t think Takeda would object to a choice like that Especially since you're de facto chairman already I'm ready to serve Tamotsu, we're all family here, so be candid with us When you had everybody renew their vows, wasn't that to shore up your position as chairman? Everybody's first loyalty now-including Takeda's brothers'-is to you Thins will get really strained if Takeda comes back as chairman No, you have to keep that separate from this That was when I'd been hauled in by the police and everybody was feeling shaky, so I thought it was necessary But in the end, the chairman is my boss That means everybody in Tensei is either his child or grandchild I've only been acting as chairman in his place, and I'm satisfied that I've done my duty to him When he comes back to us, I plan to go back to being managing director like before, and I'd be grateful for your support You know, dear, I thought you were a man who'd do whatever it took to get what he wanted But it sounds like you're going back to being Mr. Takeda's gofer Are you sure you want to give up the chairmanship so easily? Enough of your jabbering! Stay out of this! Takeda was released from prison in June 1970. With the men's personal ambitions on the verge of collision, the thorniest problem on the returning chairman's mind was how to prepare for the impending release of Hirono three months later. It's the Akashi family we need to worry about They're gonna take Hirono's release as a chance to return to Hiroshima That's what Mr. Kono in Fukuyama says, so it's reliable information Just kill him And we might as well do it while he's still in Hokkaido The fucking bastard's a ticking time bomb No telling what damage he could do if we let him live Are you volunteering? Why should I have to be the one to do it? You and Hirono are both from Kure I'm sure he's been a thorn in your side I'm not the only one here who's had bad blood with Hirono! The chairman goes without saying, and for Matsumura there's the Ichioka thing And you've had your own problems, Eda Enough already, Makihara! What you mean by that? Mr. Chairman, I suggest we send someone to inform Hirono of our terms before he gets to Hiroshima And what should those terms be? Our real problem isn't Hirono It's the Akashi family So if he agrees to break off with Akashi and go straight, we can let him return to Hiroshima Otherwise, we can't guarantee his safety That's the way I see it And you think there's actually a chance he'd accept those terms? Whether he accepts them or not, that's where Tensei stands, so I don?t think we should yield an inch Sounds to me like you're trying to pick a fight I don?t see any other choice Matsumura you served well in my stead while I was away But I need to ask you one thing here in front of the council What possessed you to renounce our coalition's political status? Have you forgotten why I formed this group? I haven?t forgotten I did it because I had no choice, for the good of the coalition After you left, the rank and file acted like they'd lost their bearings, and others started stirring up trouble Whatever we call ourselves, yakuza are yakuza! I decided the only way to keep discipline was through force That's why I made everybody pledge loyalty to me But I can't deny that I betrayed your wishes So do what you want with me All right, you've had your say For the time being, I'm going to reserve judgment on both you and the Hirono matter I know Hirono better than anyone else, and I'd like more time to consider One more thing Everything we've discussed today stays in this room Got that? But before the day was out, what transpired at the meeting had spread all over Hiroshima. Good to see you, boss Welcome To what do we owe the pleasure? Boss Yamamori and I decided we should come give you a little prodding You know, Makihara, this is no time to be twiddling your thumbs That Hirono punk's release date is just around the corner If you don't hurry and secure your position, you could be in for trouble I'm aware of that You don't know shit Boss Look, Makihara This is your perfect chance to become top dog in Tensei Matsumura talks a good line, but his real aim is to use Hirono's return to dump Takeda And for his part, Takeda's been thrown by how strong Matsumura grew in his absence and sees him as a real thorn in his side Tell him Matsumura wants to kill him, and they'll be at each other's throats While they're tearing each other down, you naturally rise to the top You don't have any competition What you say, Makihara? Make your move! I'll back you up And I've got the Shinpu Group behind me We're not talking some half-baked scheme here Hayakawa I thought you retired My men have shed their blood in this city We deserve something good from their sacrifice That's right Tensei's only going to get better Do it, Makihara! If it comes to that, I'll get out front myself I've still got plenty of life left in me Meanwhile, in Kure, Hirono's impending release had injected Hirono's men with new vitality, and they skirmished repeatedly with Makihara's men. Welcome home Listen, dear, Akio says he's willing to help out with the store He has a driver's license, so I think he could be a big help He brought these as a gift He remembered how much you like Coke - Have some, dear - I don't want any I'll set it here I think I'll have some Akio, you can stay tonight, can?t you? It's a small house, but we can always squeeze one more in Right, dear? How much did you get? - There must be Yen50 or Yen60 thousand - Great! We can get an American 45 You don?t suppose my sister's family could have died, do you? They'll be fine Nobody dies from sleeping pills Get on! JULY7, 1970 NAKAAVENUE SHOPPING DISTRICT, KURE Welcome Just a minute, please What's the matter? Let's do it some other time Please stop! Stop it! JULY7, 1970 MASAKICHI MAKIHARA DIED This incident only hardened the Tensei Executive Council's attitude toward Hirono, making things impossible for Takeda, who had hoped to find a peaceful resolution. SAPPORO PRISON, HOKKAIDO Hirono had been transferred to Sapporo prison by this time and was secretly released ahead of schedule, in the early morning. Only two of his own henchmen were permitted to meet him. Meanwhile, some 50 Akashi family members waited in vain at the main gate. They had been completely outfoxed by the prison authorities. Having thus left Sapporo under heavy security, Hirono spent three days resting in Tokyo. Hirono Don?t worry I'm not carrying Long time no see How'd you find me? Send a thief to catch a thief Can we talk in private? You guys wait here Makihara's funeral was just yesterday His wife was wailing so hard I didn't know what to do Afterwards, we had a council meeting, and we reached an agreement about you Here's the deal As far as Tensei is concerned, we can't let you return to Hiroshima unless you formally retire If you choose to come, you're a marked man That's the way it is So it's just as I'd heard What? I had a phone call from someone As I heard it, Matsumura's been stirring things up at Tensei, trying to persuade everyone you have to kill me at any cost You got it wrong That's not how it was I might feel different if it were anyone else, but I can't sit still while the man who killed Ichioka talks like that Ichioka was my only brother Who was it-this caller of yours? What does it matter? I've had calls from all over- everybody making a show of kindness It's a trap Whoever it was wants you and Tamotsu to get each other How about you, Takeda? Doesn't it piss you off for an upstart like Matsumura to get ahead of you, taking advantage of your absence to take over your defenses? Rumor has it he even planted poisoned needles in your chair I have faith in Tamotsu And meanwhile, Matsumura mocks you and me behind our backs, saying we're over the hill Let them mock if they want Hirono do me a favor and retire Otherwise you'll meet the same fate as Ichioka Fine! Come and get me if you can! I won?t fall as easily as Ichioka That's not what I'm talking about! If I retire, will you retire too? Sure, you've got your little nest egg That's got nothing to do with it It was Makihara's death that opened my eyes The punks who did him are two generations behind us Somehow, I just finally got fed up by it all I'm tired of all this "kill or be killed" shit You know what I mean? I don't believe you Out here in the real world, I don?t even trust green lights How can I know what's really in a man's heart? Hirono At any rate, I'm not gonna retire Not the way things are Ichioka said the outside air would make me my old self, and maybe it has I'd like you to go now The next day, Hirono traveled to Matsuyama, on Shikoku Island, and sought shelter with Shuzo Mikawa of the Akashi family. In Hiroshima, a rumor went around about a joint Hirono-Akashi attack, sending the Tensei leaders into a frenzy. Hydrofoil ferries traveled between Matsuyama and Hiroshima in under an hour. Three days later, Matsumura crossed to Matsuyama without telling Takeda and visited the Dogo Hot Springs, where Hirono was resting. It's been a long time, Mr. Hirono It's good to see you again What did you want to talk to me about? What kind of stunt is this? If you're here to talk, you've no use for that I thought you might need it for your reply Mr. Hirono Chairman Takeda announced his retirement this morning He wants me to succeed him Oh, yeah? So he finally retired? But I haven't decided yet whether I'll accept It depends on your reply Because if I can't prevail over you, I can?t expect to prevail over a whole city What are you trying to say? Stop beating around the bush! I've always thought the coalition doesn?t mean much unless it includes all the groups in Kure and Hiroshima If you start bringing in your Kobe friends like before, we'll just wind up fighting a proxy war again Are you accusing me of something? You people are getting up in arms all by your fucking selves Please hear me out! If you would retire, I propose to have your Ujiie and my Oda swear loyalty as brothers and make Ujiie managing director of Tensei I'm hoping you'll be willing to accept those terms Is that supposed to be some kind of ultimatum? You can take it that way if you like Haven?t you forgotten something? What do you have to say about Ichioka? The men who did it are already doing time That's not what I'm asking! Your people killed Makihara too! There are two sides to every fight! If you think I'm the only one at fault here, then take this gun and shoot me You trying to send me back to the slammer in exchange for your fucking life? Matsumura, you talk proudly about your house of Tensei, but your kitchen's a fucking mess You've got so many wanting to be in charge, you spend all your time squabbling among yourselves From what I've heard, there's no telling when even you might get shot in the back That won?t happen! Listen to me I can?t send Ujiie into a snake pit like that If you want him, you'll have to clean up your kitchen first I'll give you my reply after that All right I'll come again after my installation ceremony I'll expect your answer then Matsumura's formal installation as chairman of the Tensei Coalition was scheduled for September 20 at the Chofuro Restaurant. Matsumura headed east along Route 2 on a tour of courtesy calls. Matsumura's backer, Kono, personally took the wheel, Kubota of the disbanded Hayakawa family rode shotgun, and Eda and Mano flanked Matsumura in the back seat. They called on interested parties all along the route as they drove toward Osaka, unaware that they were followed by another car. This car carried four men, including Kaga of the former Hayakawa family, and Kondo and two others from the former Otomo family. All four of them were of junior brother status to Mano and Kubota in Matsumura's car. Their aim, of course, was to kill Matsumura. They set up ambushes twice along the way, but both times the Matsumura car altered its route due to traffic congestion and escaped harm. Pull out AMAGASAKI CITY, HYOGO PREFECTURE Boss Long time no see, Kaga! Bro, we need someone to be our guide in Osaka What for? We're gonna ice Matsumura He's coming to Osaka? He'll be here this evening to call on Sumida in Nishinari We have reliable information about that, but the streets around there are too tangled up for us All right I'm with you Thanks Hey That sounds like my kind of fun MIYAJI SENNO, TRAVELING GANGSTER Mind if I come along? SEPTEMBER 18, 1970 NEAR IMAIKE STATION IN NISHINARI Here they come! - Get in the car, Kaga! - Let me have that! Hurry up! - Get in the car! - Wait up! Fucking shit! No, you idiot! Get back in! SEPTEMBER 18, 1970 TENSEl VICE CHAIRMAN EDA DIED Eda! Matsumura had switched seats with Eda to take a nap and escaped with his life. The gunshot wound in his chest was quite serious, but after receiving first aid, he was rushed back to Hiroshima, together with Eda's body. Thermometer Before first light the following morning, Matsumura was carried into the Kawabata Surgical Hospital, with Takeda and the other officers standing guard. Meanwhile, some 200 men, mainly from the Shinpu Group, arrived to lift the spirits of the anti-Matsumura forces, led by Hayakawa. Boss, there's another call from Hayakawa I told you to say I'm not here Why are you refusing to take his calls? This is the perfect chance to destroy Tensei I'll take it What's his problem? That's why he's trapped in this fucking backwater! He knows what he's doing One false move now with Hayakawa and we'll go the way of the Ichioka and Otomo families Matsumura remained in a coma for a full 24 hours with a temperature over 104. Darling What day is today? The installation The installation ceremony No, darling! Get out my crested kimono - You mustn't! - Chief! Get my crested kimono! Darling! Kaoru, a yakuza's wife should know to stay the fuck out of her husband's business! No, darling! What the hell do you think you're doing, Tamotsu? He insists he's going to the installation ceremony! Please stop him! Listen to me, Tamotsu If you die, everything goes down the drain Give yourself time to recover and start over I'll back you You can start over Boss if I let this deter me, Tensei will fall apart for good That's why today's ceremony has to go on I have to show the bastards who did this to us, that I won't lie down and roll over Tamotsu brace yourself Under pressure from the cops, Chofuro canceled our reservation And all the bosses we invited have been calling to say they can?t attend Boss we'll have the ceremony with just our local people I don?t care if it's in a cheap flophouse or even outside Please make the arrangements I beg you! And so the installment ceremony was moved to an inn frequented by traveling salesmen on the outskirts of the city. Among the last-minute invitees were some who arrived wearing windbreakers and sandals. Mr. Hirono is here Hirono Matsumura could you find Ujiie a seat in your ceremony? A corner is fine It would be an honor The honor would be mine Looks like it's about time A few hours ago, Tamotsu was on the brink of death Neither of us could pull that off anymore Right? Takeda you've got a good man there Are you being sarcastic? Not at all At any rate, since our days are over, how about we have a drink sometime? I won't drink with you Why's that? I'd feel guilty for all those who died In that moment, both were struck by the same ominous thought: The ceremony about to take place was merely a changing of the guard. The flames of battle were sure to flare up again. SEPTEMBER 25, 1970 NAKAAVENUE IN KURE Hey, bro! They're playing "The She Gambler" Here Hey there, sweetheart What you see in her, anyway? Die, motherfucker! I'm gonna kill you! Akio you walk strong and tall now, and don't lose heart along the way And try not to stray from the path this time Hirono couldn't even remember the face of the young boy who'd been killed. But on this day, he finally decided to retire. A quarter century had passed since he'd cast his lot with the yakuza amidst the postwar turbulence. With the passage of time, one group begat another, and with each new group came new seeds of conflict. Thus much young blood had been shed. Will the bitter battles that arise from the strong preying upon the weak ever be banished from this earth? THE END
