BREAKTHROUGH MAY 1944 The German eastern front, as a result of the inverted battles during the winter... ...with the much superior forces of the Red Army, he started to push back. After the defeat at Stalingrad, the Division of Sergeant-Major Steiner... ...the withdrawal from the Odessa district began. While the victorious offensive of the German troops ended... It remains only in one direction - Retreat. - Hey, Christians, get this guy out of here! - Why? - He's dead! Can not be. We are the ones who put it here. I tried to talk to him. He's dead you idiot! He really is dead. Help me! Hey Sergeant-Major, is our train leaving again? Sergeant-Major Steiner! Hey! Paul.. Where did you come from? It's nice to see you again. I thought you blackmailed her. Who I? Yes! I always said: "I, Paul Anselme, will live to be 95 years old." I still have 71 from now. Now that the war is almost over.. - Tell me, do you know anything about the others? Kruger, Petkov, Dorfmann and Shabayn. I'm at the stations. A handful of people defend the station against the entire Russian Army. Sergeant-Major Steiner! Wait me here. I'll be right back.. - Who is it, Sergeant-Major? - Corporal Anselm, Herr Captain. That's what I thought too. I have a good memory for figures. Four days ago he was reported missing, and now he appears again. Quite strange, Sergeant-Major. - Yes! What do you order? - Prepare the car. We're leaving in 15 minutes. Stop your people too. As ordered! Anselm! It's quiet here... isn't it? It seems that Ivan is still at home... Don't be afraid... it will all be over soon. When was the last time you received letters from her? Nine weeks ago. You? You know... nobody really writes to me. Krüger! what's over there? Haven't they shot you yet? Or you ran away fast. Why don't you run now? - How long did you stay at home with your mother. - What do you think? I'm back because you just lost a bet. Well, it is! Go back to the station! We were leaving! Shabayn, does anyone see? Yes, come here! Do you know something? It's the first time in two years that I see a cow! Come on. I am leaving. He's crazy? He is from the country... He is bored. - Did you get it? - Of course. - Platoon Officer Krüger...Steiner! - Who told you to get on the train? - I thought we were all leaving together. - I told you to stay with your people. - Get off the train! I just spoke to Division Headquarters... And he gave the order to destroy the station so that the enemy could no longer use it. But Sergeant-Major, the goal has already been undermined. All that remains is to turn the handle. This is not enough! I want you to blow up the tunnel as well. But what do they have with this tunnel? I don't know what they have, but I respect the order and I don't talk with you, Sergeant-Major! Go and destroy the tunnel! Get down faster and go..! This moron probably wants to kill us all. After the artillery stops, the tanks will also appear... This is probably his chance to receive the Iron Cross. - Well, what are you waiting for? - We need to get some explosives. Come on! Let's go.. Non-Commissioned Officer, what are you doing? - Non-Commissioned Krüger destroys the station toilet that it can no longer be used by the Russians! - Get them in the car! Be careful so you don't forget something! I don't shoot any more! Maybe I'm up to something... Soon you will be... warm! Then see the party! Where are you? - Come quick! Shit! Hello Hello! Hello Hello! - Did you blow up your tunnel? Ivan attacked us. We barely managed to escape... You have received clear orders! As we understood... Are you unable to execute an order? Or it was not understood.. You know something, you're a bastard! I followed your stupid orders and it cost me the lives of my boys! I wanted to tell you for a long time that you are a piece of shit! Like your orders! Got it? To one side! Let's go! Drive! 1st Platoon! Attention! At ease...! Hey! What did they do to you? I think we can talk... Make sure he gets proper care. The bone blow didn't hurt him. However...he needs me. - Damn old man! - Outdated ass! - Are we preparing for the big retreat? Withdrawal? What do you know? There will be no withdrawal. This is a strategic regrouping of troops. to form a strong resistance... Deadly's logic. As for me.. I became a nanny for young people. - Want to see? - I don't like it... You should. I will send you five subordinates. How is Stranski doing? He was transferred to the Division Command. Do you know what they did to him? They transferred him to Paris! Therefore, we have a new company commander, Captain Berger. - Is he a good boy? - I think he is normal... Ha, ha.. - 1st Platoon, attention! Oh my goodness! Novice figures only! Who gave them the gun? They are the best. It's the last batch. The best are always in the back row. I would be an idiot if I chose the first row. Listen to me carefully! Bugger! Everyone, except for the last row, the dismiss! I'm sorry that you were not taken over by the best sergeant-major in our army. First and second row, dismiss! He is Kebele. A gift from Hitler Jugend. - Fantastic! - I came at the call by the Führer! - Did he call you? - I volunteered! - No, you're an idiot! - How long have you been a soldier? - For four years, Sergeant-Major! - And how did you become a non-commissioned office? - I fought on the front line, Sergeant-Major. And I was injured. Hmm... I'll take you with me. - Where are you from? Lebebaum. - Pimp from Vienna. Don't miss them! Yes. I know what relationships between couples mean... I saw many such things in Warsaw. I know.. I think... you will find a common language with the Sergeant-Major. He is House. He worked in the kitchen at the Nazi heads in Berlin. Was it hot in the kitchen? What are you doing here? Nothing. Nothing at all. I generally worked in the Red Cross, in medical assistance. He is Nissen, student. - What did you study? - Theology, Sergeant-Major. - Excuse me, Sergeant-Major! - You are urgently called by the Company Commander. - I'll be there in a moment. Go and tell the people about NCO Krüger. - As ordered! Things are not going too well in our company. You are up to it, in one way or another... ...tell me what is not working within the company...? But first, you must go to the Division Command. - General Hoffman wants to see you urgently. - Why? I don't know either! - I would like to discuss this with Schulze first. - Schulze? - To find out why I am called to the Division Command. - Schulze! - Go and see why he is called to the General! - You called me, Herr Captain! - It's okay, go. You are free Sergeant-Major! Report to me when you return from the General. - As ordered! What happened? The commander is in a conflict with Stranski. He was personally transferred by Herr General. - Schulze! - Yes, Herr Captain? I want to know if what Sergeant-Major Steiner said is true! - I'll check. You've got a message. Do you want to see it? I hope that another head will not be shortened. My dear Steiner! I discovered that this shit comes from you.. ...and you didn't keep your commitment and behaved like a Christian... So, Sergeant-Major, what can you say in your defence? I don't want you to waste your time, Herr General! Interesting example Steiner. Personally, I wanted to promote you to the rank of officer.. But you totally disappointed me... This was my final decision! I am sorry! - I am sorry! It was my personal decision! But Steiner we are compatriots. One day the war will end. So in the following period you will only have problems. You are always followed by Captain Stranski. You really can't change? I cannot be otherwise. So what do I do? The papers are on my desk. I simply cannot hold them for too long. Kestner! Listen Kestner, I'm the Division Commander here, or rather the Royal Prussian Chief Accountant? Of course not! Take these papers from here and sort them out! - And should I bring them tomorrow? - Of course you should. Otherwise, the entire Wehrmacht will drown in them. - I understand! Immediately send a message to the Company Commander... that Sergeant-Major Steiner received a two-week vacation... ...starting today. - Starting today? Yes! So, Steiner, go and see other things while you still have the chance! And now I'm going to show you some more ancient cooking pots. They have double bottoms... They are original aluminium with authentic pea soup scraps. In addition, these old vessels are guaranteed for many years and have been given... ...for some time to the Reich. And now, ladies and gentlemen who want to know.. This is not just any pair of shoes... It's the shoes worn by our Paul Anselm! He was a hero! He fought for a long time in these shoes! In this pair of shoes he went almost to Moscow! One thing is clear. In these shoes you can walk in any direction... ...especially in the home direction. Is it really true? - And then who has the best merits... he has the honour to continue wearing them. - Nothing is true. - If they suit me..., I give 10 cigarettes. hmm? Sold! Ladies and gentlemen, the auction is already over! Leave the documents, Herr Sergeant-Major. How did you do it? Ha, ha, ha... 14 days of vacation at home! Did you pray at the altar? - Where are you going? - I haven't thought of anywhere in particular... - Why don't you go to Paris? - Paris? Women, champagne... Why not. I think I'll have to think about it... Well, see you in two weeks. It's not possible!. Steiner! What are you doing in Paris, Herr Sergeant-Major? I have someone here, who would be happy to see me... - Did I ask you about anything? - I'm on vacation... - Show me the documents! - Here. Congratulations! You advanced to the rank of Major... Yes, and? You didn't get the Iron Cross, but at least you were promoted... Yes. Thank you, thank you...! - Strange... - What's strange Major? - I don't know... Your papers seem to be in order... and yet I see you here in Paris! - What happened Stranski? One minute, Sergeant-Major. Stranski, I've been looking for you since this morning... Colonel Kronberg urgently wants to speak to you. - He needs you at Headquarters.. - I'm ready right away.. - I have to go.. I will be back in the shortest of time. - Herr Major! - Have you been in Paris for a long time? I just arrived... it's my first time and it gives me great pleasure... The commander left this note for you. Is there something wrong? Herr Major Stranski did not pay his bill. I think it's not the first time he doesn't pay... The drink is expensive... do you think you can get drunk here? Do you want to get drunk? No, at least not at these prices. Yes, the prices are astronomical. Please put this on the Major's account. I know him. What you said? I told him that the Major was needed by much more important matters. - He comes here every day... - Aha.. If you want something to drink, I have something to drink at home in the apartment... This will not cost you as much as here. Only the music is missing... I live somewhere around here... God day Madam. Are you waiting for a more comfortable place? Why? Music is the luxury in the apartment. No no. It is very pleasant here. The stockings made these days are quite warm... And they squeeze me... So I often go without stockings. - Wine or cognac? - I don't know. - Was Major Stranski here? - Why are you asking me? - I asked you, wine or cognac? - Cognac. - Do you like the Major? - No, not really. He's a strange chap... We are all now fighting for survival. From time to time, even soldiers need to relax. I assume you don't want to drink.. No, I don't need alcohol to get me drunk. The bed gives you a feeling of warmth. Sometimes this feeling remains, sometimes not. This can be misleading. Yes, when one stands up and see this dirty world... Especially when we have problems with the concierge. He looks like he want to eat me when he sees me with Germans. Come here. Do you consider yourself a good soldier, Sergeant-Major? A good soldier is one who does not forget and who truly loves. And he is not a pig. But the concierge sees things differently. She doesn't want to see anyone's person. Blames it only on me. For her, a soldier in uniform is a beast. In what mood she is today, she wasn't really interested! But this is wrong. You are not one of those who can do harm. Bad? What happens when you are the first to shoot? We were all running like crazy everywhere... Both sides want the best, but life only kills each other. When it's all over, what will be our fate? Will we all be condemned for our past? A day like today will always be good for me. - For me too. The General Command of the Wehrmacht informs! "At dawn on of the 6th of June, the Allied Naval Forces landed in Normandy and established a bridgehead! In the area of ​​the Atlantic Ocean, heavy battles are fought by the German troops on the defensive. All those on vacation in Paris and the suburbs are requested to come immediately to the assembly points of the Wehrmacht... ...in the East of Paris!" I am sorry. It's war again. I would have stayed in Paris, but it is not possible. Anyway, I have no reason to stay. And even after the war ends, I have no one to return to you. You must arrive at the unit within 20 hours. Otherwise I will be in trouble. - Is that clear? - As ordered. From unit 71? You are at a great distance from it. Do you have any idea how many people are reported missing? And you sleep with their women? I would execute you all! Some of you will have been transferred to the Western Front. Go to the new destination immediately. Hurry to catch a lorry. If you hurry, you get to your division quickly. Do you see that our Wehrmacht is taking care of you? Hurry up to get to your division on time.. - Thank you. Rolf! Let me look at you. - How are you? - I'm fine... - So how was it in Paris? Too good to be true. I feel like throwing my backpack for joy. Be careful, I have a bottle there! It was to break glass goodness! This is our hotel. There are a lot of empty seats. - Where are the rest? - Almost everyone was killed. So, you can sleep in 3-4 beds at the same time... Most of the dead have already been buried. - To them! Is there anything to eat? My stomach is rumbling! I didn't put a single bite in my mouth in Paris. Nothing! Our friend is trying to find some food.. He said there were a lot of rabbits. - Stop it! - Who is? - A deserter! What a surprise! What do you think of Captain Berger? Believe me, he is the only honest officer here in this war. Good! First report, he rejected it for me. Leave a couple of drops for me too! Come on, let's see how we put things in place. Get down! Give him a slap in the face, let him go away! What's going on, Sergeant? One of your men wanted to desert. - If he had run away we would have shot him... - Steiner! Sergeant-Major, take care of him! But Herr Captain, we need him to report the incident. Do what you want, non-commissioned officer, but get out of here immediately! Are you ready? Well, you can finally do something for this country. Are we being sent to the front? Anyone can go. With the exception of two people from the 2nd company. They hid somewhere... They are not idiots, but they have crazy ideas in their heads... When he has to go to the front... That idiot, who wants to stay alive, shoots his toes with his gun. And, did he succeed? He got a blood infection, then had a leg amputated... and now he appears in front of the court-martial! - And what will happen to him? - I have no idea. If he's lucky, he'll live. - To the boat! - Has anyone boarded the boat? - No. - You are under arrest! - Sentry! - Didn't you see Sergeant Steiner? - No, Herr Captain. This is for our boy! Do you have any doubts? Now, that is good. Colonel Rogers presented himself as ordered, sir! Very good that you came. Please sit down! Your predecessor Colonel Petersen was a real soldier. - It is a great loss for the Division. - I will try to follow in his footsteps. Yes, it is necessary. Can you imagine what was happening here? - Mostly.. yes. - I will let you know. Here is the 71st Infantry Division under the command by General Hoffmann. Our secret services reported that this division fought on the Russian front. Excuse me, are you looking for cigarettes? Oh, this. As I said, the divisions have thinned a bit in Russia, and that means that things are not quite right. No... and we need to find out where they keep their anti-tank weapons... No, that's what you will have to find out. In a few days we will attack, and I don't want our tanks to run away from the beginning. I warn you, this means good preparation! Of course! Yes... I'm sorry, I haven't had time to look over your personal file yet... ...I have them right here under my nose. As far as I'm concerned, you finished the Military Academy on the Western Front.. ...and at 19 years old. had an accident... No! I don't understand... So... do you have military experience? Yes, sir, the Philippines... Against the Japanese. The Philippines... If I remember correctly... there was a real trap there. It was one of the biggest failures… I don't agree with you completely.. You were there even now. If I hadn't ordered you to come here... Yes, you were very efficient. Like a chef when he finishes cooking the food. Here it is completely different. We must try to do everything as it should. I think that the first part of the problems must be solved first... - Igelmen! - Sir! Can you leave the typewriter for a while and come here for a while? - What day is today? - Friday, sir! - Friday... What day? - Friday the 18th! - Friday the 18th. And here, what does it say? Did you read what day it says? - The 17th... - And why didn't you read? It's the last time.. I hope it won't happen again.. - Forgive me, sir.. And look for Sergeant Andersen urgently. Let him show the Colonel... - Rogers. - Colonel Rogers... the place where he will be installed. - Sir. - Thank you. Thank you, Colonel. - Let me know Colonel! Your binoculars. - Thank you! Excuse me, Colonel, you must sign here. - Yes of course. - The general is very pedantic... Aha.. - I noticed him. His father probably owns a prototype shop... - Sir, Sgt. Andersen is waiting for you there.. - Yes, thank you. - Andersen? - Yes, sir! Were you long with my predecessor, Colonel Petersen, Sergeant? Yes, sir! - I am the replacement for Colonel Petersen. - Yes, sir. - Is this the new Colonel? - Do you know him? - Yes, he has a long history. He is a special man. - Really?.. I think he knows what he has to do! - Saint-Valon? - Yes, sir... I have to find out where they positioned the anti-tank weapons! Because of those, Colonel Petersen was killed. What happens over there? Do you see anti-tank guns? No, sir! But what do you see? It seems they are preparing for the parade. Funny. I love the parade... It seems like they think they have already won the war. Let's try to go closer to the bushes... Therefore, the upper part cannot be seen. Let's go down there. - Yes, sir! Down there Colonel Petersen was reported missing... - Listen Sergeant, you have a special sense of humour. - Thank you, sir! Left, two, three, four! Left, two, three, four! Halt! Shoulder arms! Attention. Left turn! At rest! Listen to what I say. Soldiers Nissen, Dorfmann and Rothe return to the post. The rest should not be too far apart... except for those who will end up on the hands of those lads... it will be bad. I don't think you will want this so... check the information. Looks like it's here. First platoon attention! Dismiss! Good morning, Sergeant-Major. Are you exercising the soldiers directly under bombardment? No, Major. The Americans are no cause for concern! They fire according to a well-established schedule... according to the clock. After dinner, before it gets dark they fire at the other side. From 9 o'clock in the morning until noon, they bombard this part. Don't worry, Major. Thank you! The situation seems to be calm... Give me a report on the current situation... General Hofmann wants to know of all this in half an hour... - Please come with me, Herr Major. - Thank you! What happened? - Starting today, he is our new battalion commander. - Thank you.. - Who the hell is this? - The owner's niece, Herr Major. He is sick and cannot leave his room. Does that mean there are still civilians? Yes, unfortunately Herr Major... We cannot know where they are hiding... Well Steiner, how many? A lot. Most of them are old people. They hide in basements. It's terrible. Good morning, Herr General! Allow me to report the situation to you.. Thank you. Later. I visited the valley. - I don't think there is any danger... - We are still on our shoulders... We will wait. Can Sergeant-Major Steiner give me some information in half an hour? - Of course, Herr General. - Sergeant-Major Steiner! I want a report on the Kestner situation. He has a weakness for all things black and white. Tell me, Steiner, What do you think about this war? About the war? It's nonsense, like any other. Be careful, you are still talking to a General. Some speculate that, after Stalingrad, we lost the war. It's true? - What do you say about this? Have we lost all hope? We lost our hopes from the first day. You think so... and despite this fact, you fought like an honest soldier. It is a question of survival? It's just a matter of life and death, Steiner. The war is lost... The fact remains. Whether Berlin wants it or not... I want to be moved to another place... I will contact General Webster and surrender... All German generals are ready for reconciliation. But Adolf Hitler is not aware of this? In two days, Adolf Hitler will no longer be alive! My friends and I proceed to negotiations with the Allies. For a decent future in Germany. I understand what you are talking about, Herr General... Some things have to rewrite the history of the world... But we must act. It looks like a hunting lodge... Do they know the conditions in case the Germans surrender their weapons? - We will ask them. - Okay. You take this side, and I take the other side. - OK, sir! - Send the signal! - Weapons down! Will you not ask where the others are, or am I asking you, Colonel? Two Americans were killed. Young Dorfmann is wounded in the leg. You and Nissen, take them back. I stay with the prisoners. Do you want Dorfmann to bled to dead? - I say hurry... - Go! Do you want to make an agreement with us? - Sit down! - You will be in trouble. - I know. Turn off the radio, Colonel. What do you want us to do? There are many generals who are in favour of a ceasefire. Better than unconditional surrender... It's worse than a meat grinder. Therefore, General Hoffman has authorised me to... - Did he authorise you? Since when does a general send a Sergeant-Major to a negotiate a truce? Surprisingly, it's easier for a Sergeant-Major to talk... - The Führer sent his girlfriend here. Let him talk! - No, no, colonel! At this moment Hitler is insufferable everywhere. In a few hours he will no longer be alive. - I've seen a lot in life, but why should I trust you? I risked my life to come here. I could have died there, like the other two of your comrades. So then? OK. What can you tell us? Tomorrow midday, at 1400 hrs, our officers are coming to St. Valon. They want to meet with you and Brigadier General Webster... To negotiate an immediate truce. Our army will meet with you tomorrow at 1400hrs.. and with the General in Saint-Valon. Of course..., without any escort. I think that is how we will do it. I will report all this to General Webster. How do I report the name of the person who gave us this information? Steiner Sir. Sergeant-Major Rolf Steiner, 71st Infantry Division. OK, Steiner, I'll leave now, I think there's no other problem... Thank you, Colonel. Don't forget your weapon. Do you trust us? As a Sergeant-major, I am too old to be able to trust people so quickly. You can also take that radio. A little gift from me. Maybe you will listen to Lili Marleen or you will hear about the sudden death in Berlin... Imagine what would be said about this if it were to be found out... I'm glad I don't have to make a report... - A Sergeant-Major? - Yes, sir. A Sergeant-Major. Are you saying that the generals sent a simple Sergeant-Major... ...and they want to kill Hitler? Why not? Maybe General Hoffman actually is the source. This is the greatest stupidity... I have never heard anything like this... It was also a surprise for me. The surprise was at the Battalion Commander... He was in German captivity for 10 minutes and returned safely and peacefully... - Now it's not about that. - Now it's not about that! - What could it be about? The counter-offensive will begin in a few hours the... Do you think Germans are idiots? Do you know what they want? - They want to buy time! I ordered that the armistice be enforced on all fronts. I promised them on your behalf that this would be noted. - In whose name? - On your behalf, Sir... Here, sir, you are at the command and the situation is the one presented... - I can't believe it! - I refuse to believe it! I don't believe this! - You should not have revealed the name of your commander to the enemy. - Is everything washed in my head? - You don't have to be surprised! An attempt is being made to assassinate Hitler, General... And the cessation of hostilities on the entire Western Front! Was someone supposed to call me? Was someone supposed to call me and tell me that I needed to speak to a sergeant-major? And because of this, I have to cancel the offensive? Maybe we should remove the front line troops... Or show the Germans the current situation? The decision regarding the offensive is yours. There is no need to do such a thing, without receiving other additional information. This also applies to you. I don't care who it is! - If all these things can be a bluff... - Who will look like an idiot, me? And yet... this information is important. They should not be neglected. Well, I'll report all of this above... higher up. But, if all of these is swallowed… then I will wear a wig similar to Marlene Dietrich's. And I advise you that this should also apply to the German soldiers. I'm going to get over there, General. - Mhhh. - Come here! - Can you do me a personal favour? - Yes, sir! - Get out of here immediately! - Yes, sir! - Hello? I'm Brigadier General Webster.. - Put me in touch with the General Staff, with General Kalentonom, please. - Yes. I'm waiting. - Igelmen! - Yes, sir! - Make me a coffee! - Coffee, sir! - Coffee, I said! Coffee, coffee, I said, are you deaf? - Yes, sir! - Move it! You get 10 points for field orientation and 4 points for coffee! Yes, sir! Hello, hello.. no, I wasn't talking to you. I ordered a coffee. I am Brigadier General... Mr. Webster... General Kalenton... I know... ...maybe you won't believe me, but... I have a Colonel here... who fell into the hands of the Germans... of a Sergeant-Major... - Ordered... Yes, I hear you. Yes, Herr Marshal! Yes, I have to wait too long. But at least we tried. Nothing can be done any more. Thank you for your time! Thank you. No, I don't need anything. Excuse me for bothering you, Herr General... Maybe you should rest for a couple of hours... - Can I give you something? - No.. Put me in touch with Saint-Valon. Herr General, it is impossible. Communication was interrupted this morning. Then no one can help us any more. Why are you not going to bed? Tomorrow the war will continue. Understood. Good night, Herr General... - Take this urgently to General Hofmann! - Yes! Where are the Americans? What happened? - They disappeared. - How are you? - Thank you.. even better - Good. - Good. - How was this possible? - Americans are more inventive than we. You can't always be at front, Kebele. And this is very annoying. It really annoys me... Heil Hitler! As far as I know, no one has revoked the order to salute a General of the Wehrmacht? General Hoffman, by order of the Führer you are under arrest! You are also being relieved from the command of the Division! You are accused of high treason and the attempt to kill the Führer! I have the conviction order here! You can read it if you want! No, thank you. I try to avoid reading such things done by the Gestapo in their pig language... I will be happy to exercise this right. I don't want to read pamphlets out of the package. If you are talking about a leash, this suits you better! Am I facing a court-martial? It's all just a formality. Most of the conspirators will be shot tonight. Their goods will be confiscated, and their families will be sent to concentration camps. and their names will be deleted from all documents, There is another option... - Accept it. It immediately creates a heart attack... You will be buried with honours and your widow will receive a good pension... And all things will be forgotten after a certain time. - What do you want? - I have to talk to Herr General Hofmann! Not now. - What an idiot! - Objective achieved. - Its bad..! With a heart attack, we would have silenced this history, but with a bullet in the head...? Berlin.. Yes Berlin! Contact me.. What was his name? Say... Does anyone know him? I don't know. Hello Hello! Welcome to suicide battery. Did you notice anything? I was waiting but nothing is visible... - Nothing can be seen. Krause, Steiner here. Did you notice anything? Doesn't matter. This silence is suspicious... This is not good. It's probably too hot. Do you think they have more tanks than we have, Herr Sergeant-Major? Well, I think so. They have a lot of tanks... I think they don't even know that they can beat us at any time... But if they start attacking, I think they will soon be in Paris. - At least that's my opinion... - Quiet! This will be on our side. We will be hard as a rock. - Well good, don't do it in your pants. - What is happening? Yes, Major! I'm Petty Officer Krüger! Yes, Major. Right away. Fuck! I think something is happening. The battalion is on full alert. It seems that they are expecting an offensive. Stranski kisses you passionately and urgently wants to meet you! Carefully observe the road! If you notice something, I want to find out first, not Stranski or Berger. Yes, Sergeant-Major! Where is the main post? Away! Go away! NCO! Get everything moving! Hurry up! Prepare the defence line! Ah... Sergeant-Major Steiner! Does it seem unusual for you to receive orders? Did you listen to Dr. Goebbels' speech on the radio yesterday? - No! A group of German officers tried to kill the Führer! Your old friend Hoffman was with them. He shot himself this morning. From this moment on, all orders will be issued by the Führer himself! That's the only way we will win! - Steiner, take your mind off the retreat. We are just waiting for a victory! You understand? Remove the cannon from the area! Report to me in half an hour! It looks like hell is about to break out. The Americans are in a hurry to reach Berlin. By the way, the truth can belong to you... Thank you! I will not touch anything until the Americans arrive. Looks like it won't work. Colonel, what do you think the Germans are up to? If all generals come, who will take over your command? All I know is that General Webster sent the information. Then they just have to hurry. Our tanks are ready for battle. What else is there to see? Column of dust. No more... - Let's get back to the good part. SUB MISSING FOR 50 SEC. DIALOGUES If Steiner was there, I don't know why they broke the agreement. - Anette, you have to remember! - Bring the best champagne! - Champagne? Yes, the best! Let's drink to the death of our enemies. Boys, you need to unload the lorry and bring the crates here. You have all confidence! This is just the beginning. They are just small projectiles. See you later..! - What is this? - What is happening here Kebele? - So bastard... In the Hitler Jugend you were not told that! - Don't you ever attack defenceless girls? - I am sorry. I just wanted... Damn it! You are a stinking pig. With such behaviour you deserves to be killed! Come on, quick, quick! I told you to hurry! Move! Thank you. Go to the basement. - Where are the rest? - In the basement. - And you left them here? - Yes, Sergeant-Major. - Is everyone here? - No. Langner is missing. - Where did he go? - I sent him to pick up the last box, Herr Major! - I told you not to go outside! He was killed! I will bring the box. Thank you, Sergeant-Major! Good job. Come with me. I'm going to show you something... I got an idea. We can cross through this sewer.. This sewer passes one kilometre under the entire area. I want to hear what you think about my idea? It is brilliant. Now, you will definitely get your Iron Cross, Major. I'm one against an entire Panzer Division, Sergeant-Major! Nothing will stop me! I will destroy them! Provided that all tanks come grouped in one square metre... I also asked myself this problem... I thought about everything. General Webster wants to see you, Colonel. As far as I can see, there is no unforeseen problem. According to our calculations, in an hour we will be at points... ... Hebel and Becker at hour H plus three. - Yes, sir! I'm here. Thank you! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. Wait a minute. I have something to convey to Colonel Rogers. About this Sergeant-Major... There is information that he tried to organise a coup, but failed. If Herr Hoffman is alive, we can cross the town without a fight. If he is really alive... and I hope he is... The main thing is not to have been searched by the Gestapo. The city is like a fortress... If he destroys it, he will be buried alive and the teams will work for almost a year to dig it up... Did the General Headquarters reject the negotiations? In general, they didn't really react. So, gentlemen, listen to me.. Listen carefully! We are the founders of our first major operation in Normandy! All military experts and everyone will closely monitor our actions. I intend for the world to make history, and not shit! It's clear? Now obey my orders! Exactly at 14:00, as soon as our guns stop firing, we will put the plan into action. But don't forget: your goal is not Saint-Valon, but Saint-Marie! Saint-Valon will be after you... Do you understand? - Yes, sir! - Any questions? - No, sir! Good. OK. I want to take advantage of this opportunity... ...and I tell you that I need everyone now. Good luck! - General! - Yes. If the High Command rejects the negotiations, please understand... My opinion is that you should not interfere... Believe me, Rogers, I agree with you.. but now I can't find the words. Maybe after the assassination of Hitler, something will change... What else can I say? As they say, don't ask why, but... - Go and do your duty, won't you? - Yes, sir! - Aaaa... Rogers... - Sir. - I want to tell you something. - Tell me, sir. - Good luck! - Thank you, General! And thank you. Take care of where you put it until we stop... - Well, Colonel, we will crush them! - I'm going to kick their ass! - Who is that? - It's a new one... ... he arrived last week. He doesn't know much! They stopped. All ready? Take your positions! - NCO Langner! - Langner. - Is the cannon intact? - Yes. - Then take care of it! - Yes, Sergeant-Major! Come on! - How did you get here? - I was replaced. By order of Stranski. I should have expected something like this... But in moral terms... - I think in the end... - Is it all over? - Yes. - To survive, there must be a way.. - Correct... And in the right place. When the tanks come, do me a favour, hide your ass in the basement. Thank you for the tip! We have been waiting for half an hour, sir. - What do you think, Sergeant? - About what Colonel? If General Hoffman is in session there, our army is waiting in the headquarters. It doesn't matter how many mothers have lost their sons. Well... I think you have to take the initiative personally... When it comes to the lives of many people... Well, there is only one possibility. What are you thinking about? - Sergeant Andersen! - Yes, sir! Can you lend me your jeep in a few minutes? The Jeep is my best friend's. I don't want to be unfair to it. - Come here! - What is the Colonel thinking? - I think he's going to check the area. He hoist a white flag. American tanks can only come from there. In no case from another road. When most of them reach your area, they will blown into the air. So... if we destroy the tanks, we will finish all the weapons. Don't fire any weapons... until you hear the explosion. - It's clear? - Yes, Herr Major! - Good, everyone to work! - Yes! Sergeant-Major Steiner! Tell me, is the area completely free? Yes, Herr Major. It's almost free.. You're right, it's almost free... - Sergeant Becker! - Herr Major! - Come with me. I need to speak to you. - As ordered! - Stranski. What? An American Jeep? Yes, Herr Major, an American jeep about a kilometre away. With the white flag. Let him get close, and then destroy him! - But it has a white flag! - Do not comment! That's an order! - Yes! It's an abnormal thing if they shot my radio... It's still a good thing.. They didn't hit us. - Everyone to the square! - Hurry up. Hurry up. - Everyone out.. - Get everyone out of the houses.. They quickly entered the area, Herr Major! They occupied the whole area! They also have infantry! And at least 50 tanks. Excellent! The French population should be ready to welcome them: Welcome to the area! What happens here? I have no idea. Ask Herr Major. - I will... - Bring them back! - I am sorry, but Herr Major ordered... - I said back! - Everything done? - Yes, Herr Major! - Good. - Herr Major! - You can't let this happen Stranski! - Why not, Sergeant-Major? You made me think that the area looked dead. Dirty bastard! Shit! - Don't try to do anything! Relax.. This time, no one can stop us! Now, you can throw your favourite radio in the bin. It is absolutely forbidden to fire! Monsieur, Monsieur... Sergeant-Major, what happened to General Hoffman? Did it mean anything to us? Was it important? - What is the Major doing? - I don't know. We can't shoot at civilians. In the name of Greater Germany! Betty Grable. Do you drive it? No, it's operated by Andersen. And yet, where do you have anti-tank weapons, Sergeant-Major? Everywhere. I have orders to destroy them! I know. But first let the civilians go into the basement. Fire! Fire! - Beware! - For the Führer! It's sad we couldn't learn about peace.
