The Exquisite Cadaver “The horror, the intense visceral horror of nightmares, composed upon her face an expression of infinite panic. Arms with ghostly hands suddenly emerged from the darkness advancing toward her. Arms with coarse hair, with sharp, ashy elbows, shrivelled, scaly and dark.” Chapter Three... - Thank you, that's enough. Do you like it? - I'll tell you when to read the rest. This just arrived. They insisted that it was personal. I'd prefer to save the description of the hands for the next chapter, where he tears off a bite. I can see that you're a follower of the suspense novel. Yes, sir, a book for me is like an act of terrorism. Clever idea. Imagination is salvation. I prefer hearing about that than technique and narrative, Even so... Is this your idea of imagination? From now on, submit your suspense novels to another editor. Good day. I don't understand. - I said good day. Come here a moment. What is it? Look at what that idiot understands by imagination and suspense. A hand. - A disgusting wax hand. Wax? It doesn't exactly smell like wax. Resmes would never have thought up a joke so stupid. Why not? All writers are a little crazy. It's wax. In any case... Don’t say a word to anyone. - Yes, sir. Fire! - I hit him. - No, that was me. My rifle's aim is better than yours. Did I hit you in the eye? Is this how you greet your father? Was it green or red? - What? The ball that hit you in the eye. Where's your mother? - She went out. - With the new neighbour. - They had drinks. - And talked... - About dresses. - And men. And pills. - That's enough. Give me a kiss and go play outside. - It was red. - It was green. No, wait. - Red. - Green. - Galapagos. - Chelonian. Is a turtle an animal or a fish? It's a reptile. - A quadruped reptile? Do reptiles eat lettuce? You promised to behave. That was before. Today we promised nothing. Well, all right. Go out and play. And throw away that disgusting turtle. He had no idea what a Chelonian turtle is. Or a Galapagos. - Or a loggerhead. - Or a flatback. Or anything. ...a large flock of kestrels hawks and other birds to take down magpies or crows. Because we've seen that owls are the farmer's greatest ally. Owls are our... - When did you get back? From where? I've been home all day. Those lying kids. They told me you went out. Why would I go out? The girl was here today. They must have meant her. No, they meant you. I called your office this afternoon, and they told me you weren’t in. I had to deal with something annoying. You received a telegram. From who? - From someone named Parker. Who? - Parker. It's very strange. It says if you're interested in a forearm... A what? - Here, read it. What is it? It's about a book. - A book? A science fiction book, a good one. Titled Forearmed. We want to publish it. Yes? What is there this afternoon? From 5 to 6, a meeting with Pomar, the photographer, and later, at 7, with the publisher. Anything else? Yes, I made an appointment with Resmes for 4:30. Again with that idiot. He was so embarrassed from the other day, I thought I should call him.... - From now on, consult with me before making a decision like that. I just... - I'm leaving, and won't be back until 5:30. What should I tell Resmes? - Think of something. The boys are upset. Toby is dead. Toby? - The turtle. Dad said Toby was a repugnant reptile. If he was, it was a serious offense. And seriously he has paid. - And seriously he has paid. He was our friend, our loyal friend. but Dad said he was a repugnant reptile. A package came for you. - A package? Who sent it? - How would I know? The guy who brought it swore he found it on La Rambla. Can I open it? - No! With Dad's permission we will pay tribute to Toby at his funeral. - We are going to pay tribute. May he eat lettuce in peace. A dress. A dress? And a photo. Hold on, a candle went out. And this. Ready? Let's go. Please give me a moment, my heart is heavy. Do you know her? - No. Are you sure you don't know her? - I'm sure. I don't know her. How odd. Don't you think? It looks odd, but it's not. My friend Parker wants me to find that woman to give her the dress. Sure, and he abandoned the package in the street. The mailman could have lost it. - Of course. And I suppose it's also possible to find a woman among two million with a simple photograph. It's possible. Parker gave me some details. She sells tickets at a movie theatre. Which one? I'm sorry, but it seems very odd to me. We would be unfair to Dad, who is an honorable man. That ticket girl wears expensive perfume. As you all know, Toby adored Dad. What nonsense. Want to see what I'll do with that junk? Hey! - Maybe now we can have some quiet. Instead of interrogating me, you could better use your time educating those vandals. Boys, it's bathtime. You first. No, me second. Go on, you've caused enough trouble. - I believe that you are right. This almost hit me in the head. I know how kids are. But next time, I'll call the police. I'm sorry, I promise it won't happen again. It better not. Good morning. Good morning. Hey! Did you find your ticket girl? Yes. Did you give her the dress? Yes. Is it as pretty as it looks in the picture? No. What's this? A notice from the post office. Another package from your friend Parker, I suppose. I wonder what it could be this time. Someone has had the idea of sending you food, which is emitting an unbearable smell. Here. What do you want? I'm the victim of a terrible joke in poor taste, sir. I just received this package... - Yes, you received a package. It's possible it's just a joke. But I think it could also be something much more serious. In any case, I want you... Well, I suspect that inside the package is maybe... If you want to speak to the commissioner, you'll have to wait. I may not have explained very well. I'm trying to say that inside this package is... What is the matter? - It's regarding this package. The commissioner wants to know if you're going to make a complaint. I don't know yet. The contents? I'm not sure exactly, but it might be something horrible. Who sent it? A stranger. You suspect a bomb might be inside? No. If you haven't opened it, how do you know it's not a bomb? Because it smells bad. It smells, yes. And you think the commissioner is the appropriate place to bring this? It's possible that this package contains human flesh. Your I.D. card, please. What makes you think it contains human flesh? Because it stinks. Doesn't it smell like a corpse? Don't waste my time. You received a package that smells bad. So? I advise you to go home, open it, and if you believe it merits formulating a complaint, go to the commissioner of your district, not here. Yes? The boss is coming, and he looks mad. - Thank you. Good morning. Did anyone call? - Your wife. When? - Your wife is here. Hide this. Make it disappear. Burn it. Give me that folder, and button up your blouse. Okay. Why are you here? Did something happen? That's what I want to know: did something happen? No, why? You look a bit nervous. Nervous? Why would I be nervous? - Because of the package. What package? The package you went to pick up this morning. If you're referring to Parker's package, I still haven't gone to pick it up. I saw her. Who? - Her. Who is 'her'? - The woman from the picture. Parker's friend, the ticket girl. How do you know it was her? I never forget a face. - Look, honey. I'm busy. I have work to do. So... Before coming here, you went directly to the post office. I followed you in a taxi. You went to the package department. In the meantime, I pretended to write a telegram. A woman beside me attracted my attention. She was also writing a telegram, but with her left hand. I recognized her immediately. She was the one from the photo. Everything was very clear. She also watched your every move. I couldn't understand why, but it occurred to me that she was already following you. I had to follow her. At the third beep, it will be 11:10:20. At the third beep, it will be 11:10:30. At the third beep, it will be 11:10:40. At the third beep, it will be 11:10:50. At the third beep, it will be 11:11. Taxi! Where did she go? To our house. She got out of the car and delivered a note to the doorman. And the note? It's very short. Apparently it has to do with a book. Now tell me everything, from the start. Who is Parker? A friend. - Male or female? Male. What was in the package that you received today? Books. It's all a lie. Excuse me, someone left something for you. One moment. Here it is. Who brought this? - A woman, about ten minutes ago. What did she look like? - Well... She was tall, with brown hair. Dressed in black. I think that's right. Do you remember if she took this envelope out of her bag? Out of her bag? No, I don't think so. I remember, she had the envelope in her hand when she got out of the car. It was a black car with French plates. Thank you very much, but I want to know maybe you don't remember - it's not so important - but... this... the hand... - What? Did the woman give it to you with her right hand or her left? One moment, let me think. I think that it was the left hand. No, the right. No, it was the left. I'm sure it was. Thank you. If you want the license plate number... The license plate? Why did you take down the license plate number? A habit, from when I was on the force. Thank you. You're right, it's artificial. Who are you? Is Parker your real name? You still don't know it? It's been years. But I can describe in detail every time we've crossed paths. I hoped this place, this house maybe could remind you. - I recognize this house. But I was never here with you. I was with someone else. That person was like a part of myself. And her? What has become of her? She died. When? How did she die? She died. She's dead. Do you want to sit down? One way of getting your attention. I know I've made things uncomfortable for you. But I want as much as you to finish this game. Do I look attractive? Yes. Even with my artificial hand? Yes. Or maybe because of it? Are you still afraid of me? No. But if you explain.... Please, not with words. There are simpler ways to make one understand. What is that? Everything. Nothing. Only a piece of blotting paper. Take it, and you'll have the answer you desire. Keep it in your mouth. Long enough for the doors to open. The same passion that supported such great hopes can only now make me mortally despair. My eyes lost in yours the only light that encouraged them. Only tears remain which know nothing other than crying. Since I knew you had resolved to leave me, it was so intolerable to me that soon I would die. A thousand times I felt my sad thoughts calling out to you without returning to anything else. The empty echo of my misfortune. The bitter voice that ceaselessly repeated that I must stop loving. The man I won't see again. Who fled from me, Who cares nothing for my suffering and sadness. A man annoyed by my raptures, who detested the generous madness of my feelings, But I can't resolve myself to think of you only in those terms. I don't want to imagine that you've forgotten me. Forgive me, the emotions you make me feel are always very excessive. You know well that I love you like mad. I don't want to complain about this insane fury in my heart. I feel guilty every moment that I'm not thinking of you. What can I do, wretch that I am, without so much hate and love? Can I survive this all-consuming obsession in order to have a calm and carefree life? No, never. I can't be content with that emptiness and with that indifference. I drown in my excessive sorrow, in the uncertainty of my thoughts, in my contradictory emotions, in my desperation, in my melancholy, in my jealousy. I know I'm talking in vain about the unbearable state I find myself in. But I can't help it. Before I finish, I beg you, hopelessly: Come see me, please. You have to come see me. How mad. I know very well it's not possible. Goodbye. I appreciate the tortures you inflicted on me, and detest how peacefully I lived before meeting you. I cannot go on. Goodbye. Make your poor lover suffer even more. They're watching us. What time did I arrive home? - You didn't arrive. I brought you. What's happening to me? Your body is fine. Don't worry, it's not dangerous. Someone called this morning. It was her. For you. He's asleep. I gave him a sedative. - You gave him a sedative? Why, what's happened? - I don't know. Nor do I know why your husband has been following me for the last two weeks. He showed up here two hours ago. What do you want? Who are you? I don't frighten easily. It was easy to bring your husband under control. I put a sedative in his whisky. I preferred to call you instead of the police. That's an absurd story. Do you believe her? - I don't believe her. But I'm sure you have another story just as absurd, and I'm sure you're going to tell me it. Aren't you? - I don't have time. You followed me. What were you looking for over there? A hand. A hand that I received in a package. At first I thought it was wax. Someone's idea of a joke. Now I'm not so sure. It might have been real. Everything you've said today sounds crazy. A woman's hand, whose corpse I found yesterday inside a fridge in Parker's home. This keeps getting more incoherent. How do you know it was a corpse? Just admit you dreamed it. I'm telling the truth. - What you believe is the truth. It was the corpse of a woman I knew a long time ago. Coffee. LSD? What? - Lysergic acid? No, it's something much more ordinary. But they don't work. I've gained weight. Do you have problems? I'm bored. Where are you from? - I live in Paris. Alone? - With a friend. What do you do? Nothing. I live with my friend. Would you have dinner with me? Depends. What's your sign? What? - Zodiac sign. Ah. Scorpio. - Oh. In the Middle Ages they burned them relentlessly. And you? I don't want to tell you. You'll laugh. I think I already know what it is. Is it, or isn't it? - Please. The truth is that... I'm a Cancer. What happened? Are you okay? Five. You aren't afraid of heights? How high are we? Maybe 200 meters. One might say we're one step away from death. Only one step, but I don't want to take it. I can take it. Never take a step that doesn't lead somewhere. I can take that step, if you ask me. All right. I ask you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Nine steps. I'm waiting. Are you serious? - Completely serious. I've always wanted my death to belong to another. It belongs to you. To die so that my love for you endures, so that it isn't killed by indifference, so boredom can't destroy it. Let's go to the hotel. Here, right now. It only lasted two weeks. It's been two years now, and I never saw her alive again. I was aware of everything. Looking through your papers one day, I found a letter. I know I shouldn't have, but I read it and put it aside. I never answered those letters. That letter was very beautiful. - Go on, try now. It's not true that your affair lasted only two weeks. When I found out what was happening, my reaction was not a happy one. I wanted to be thoroughly informed. I wanted to know what this woman meant to you. I hired someone to follow you. It wasn't difficult to obtain the evidence I needed. Evidence that at first enraged me, until I got to the bottom of what I was feeling, which wasn't jealousy, but envy. I did nothing. I tried by all means to avoid reproaches. I was sure that one day you would come to tell me that you and her.... The usual. But I was wrong. What I had assumed was so beautiful and deep, so important to you, was broken off in a day. It was broken off extremely easily. And I didn't know how to be happy about that. Don't leave me, please. I'll do whatever you want. But don't leave me, please. Don't go. Stay! Stay! Stay! Passion used like a weapon. I'm already accustomed to be skeptical of everything you say. With her, everything was doomed to blow up. I wanted to know the truth myself. Limitless offers, excessive requests. But now I'm ashamed of my curiosity, for knowing barely important details. She clung tightly to a romance novel of her own imagination. Instead of trying to understand your behaviour, I should acknowledge your right to hide it from me. I was nothing more than a passive object, necessary for her raptures. Instead of figuring out your intentions, I should worry about my own. A reflection for her overwrought emotion. Because what bothered me and humbled me the most, was the stupid role of wife that I had been playing. What are you talking about? I don't expect you to change. I want to be the one to change. What nonsense. You'd prefer that I lie to you, like you do? Enough already! There's not a big difference between you and her. Always showing off your lovely little emotions. Always searching for transcendent explanations. Well no. Sorry to disappoint you, but things are not as you think they should be. They're frivolous, stupid. Frivolous? Stupid? Ironically, I might have saved my rival's life. I'd like to talk with... - Let her in. I didn't know if it would be you or your husband. Well? Come with me. Do you want to sit down? What is it? - I don't believe what you told me yesterday. What is your husband's version? It seems too much like the novels he's used to publishing. A little story, with a little corpse. Exactly. Do you know who Esther Casino was? Yes, one of my husband's lovers. The only one who was madly in love with your husband. Other than you, of course. Do you recognize her? When I first saw her, she was in the hands of a charlatan. An impostor called Dr. Barrés. Miracle? Did we beat Leukemia? - Have I changed? - I beg your pardon? Another please. - - Good. Hello? Can I help you? Perhaps I could be of some use to you. Who are you? I was in the elevator and... If you need help, just say, 'yes.' Yes. Come in. Where is he? - In there. With the stool. Help me. Is he dead? - I don't think so. What are you going to do when he wakes up? I don't know. - Do you think he might hurt you? I don't want to find out. Do you have anywhere to go? No. If you want you can come with me. Get your things together. Why are you telling me all this? I thought you would be interested to hear about Esther. My husband believes that you sent him a woman's hand. That's right. And that you keep a corpse in this house inside a fridge. It's true. This woman's corpse. That's also true. If it's true, show me. The corpse? It's all that remains of Esther Casino. Esther... Listen to me, Esther. There is a dark place inside all of us. An inescapable tendency to destroy ourselves. If it's only your heart that is consuming you... resist it until it kills you. Use your rage for revenge. There's no other way. I love you madly. I feel torn apart by a thousand contradictory thoughts. I don't know who I am, nor what I should do. Nor what I want to do. The same feeling that arouses my passions, can drive me to desperation. I do as many things to preserve my life, as to lose it. Is it madness? If only this indecision were to become true despair, then deciding would be simple. To die for love. A tragic ending. An ending worthy of us. Maybe you would think of me often. Maybe you wouldn't be able to forget me. Maybe you would cherish my memory. Isn't it better this way? Instead of carrying on in this miserable situation. Goodbye. I wish I had never met you. You killed her? Esther died for love. It irritated me that he kept his life cut off from Esther, indifferent to her tragedy. It was all too cruel. I wanted to let him know that something terrible was happening. Something he couldn't be oblivious to. I put the corpse in the fridge. and that same evening I sent the first package. Of course I didn't know then the most ridiculous revelation of the whole story. What do you refer to? - Five long years, listening to passionate descriptions of that man, witness to a hopeless, frustrated love. Five years impotently contemplating the ruthless immolation of Esther. And the ridiculous revelation? The man for whom Esther had suffered a devastating passion, the man I hated, the man she loved, was an imbecile. A total imbecile. A fool! The saddest semblance of a man! A vulgar collector of affairs, unworthy of Esther's pain! Hello. I started to think you wouldn't come. Resmes is here. I can't see him. - He wants an advance. Okay. How much does he want? - $5,000. Get me the chequebook. I'm going on a trip. Suspend the print run of Terror in the Black Mansion until the new order. Yes, sir. Resmes wants to know the publication date. Tell him to go to hell. What's this? - It just arrived. Sign a receipt. - Okay. Is it something serious? No. Nothing. Nothing. Call the police. I'm not trying to provoke you. Nor is it my intention to make you look ridiculous. Accept it for what it is, the clearest and simplest proposal. Do you accept? I don't like your proposal, and I don't believe a word of what you just told me. I save my lies for a different sort of person. Wait a moment. What's your name? Lucía Fonte. And I live in Paris, in the Hotel Lutece. Note down the time. You, go around the house. - Right away. It's locked. - Force it open. Both at once. Who lives at the house with the Citroën? - I saw it go by yesterday. They've got inside the house. - Let's wait here. If the police are here, something's up. Suárez here, put me through to EB-25. Burnt clothes. They've been set on fire. - Moliner here. It's Suárez. I've searched the house. The man was right. There's a woman's body in the fridge. She's missing a hand and a head. What do we do with the editor? - Take him to the station.
