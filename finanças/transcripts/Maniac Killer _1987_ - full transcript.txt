(cat meowing) (footsteps crunching) (owl hooting) (victim shrieking) (shoes shuffling) (owl hooting) (retro rock music) - Come on, Manny. You've had enough. Let's go home. - Home? Which one, mine or yours? - I'll take you to your door. You gotta sleep it off. Come. - Look who's givin' the orders now. - Manny, please c'mon on home. I'll take good care of you. - Ha! Take care of me? (laughs) You can't even take care of your johns. You're not doin' so good lately. (retro rock music) (hand slapping) Now get lost. (Rosalee weeping) (shoes shuffling) (soft mysterious music) (owl hooting) - Who's there? (shoes clacking) Oh. (shoes clacking) (Rosalee breathing heavily) (Rosalee shrieking) (owl hooting) (shoes clacking) (door squeaking) (soft mysterious music) (chains rattling) (Rosalee breathing heavily) - Ready. (retro rock music) (Rosalee shouting) Come back. Come back. Come back. - No, no! (screams) No! (Rosalee screaming) (smooth Celtic music) (people chattering) - Listen, everybody. - Hi. - Wanna hear some news real hot? - Better be good. - A girl has been kidnapped, young and pretty. Anybody know her? - Who is she? - No idea. - Then how do you know she's young and pretty? - She oughta be. It happened in front of that nightclub uptown. That's where she used to hang out. - She's one of those, huh? - Those what? - He wouldn't know. He hasn't cheated on his wife in 20 years. (Bernard laughing) Maybe she just left town. You know, those dames that move around a lot. - Not her. The Sergeant told me confidentially. You know the police went to her apartment, right? And you know what they found there? Everything. All her clothes, her toothbrush, her slippers. This girl vanished (snaps) just like that. - I wonder who would do such a thing here in town. - Come to think of it, that tall fella that lives in that house out by the cemetery. He moved in a few years ago. He came from uh- - [John] From California. - Yeah, right. California. His name is Osborne. He's a scientist. A bio somethin', huh? He had the leave because he was in trouble with the law. He did tests on women and somethin' went wrong. - And how? Some died, they said. - No kidding. Well let me tell you then. That Professor Osborne? He doesn't let anybody into that house, not even me. And that maid of his. Man, she's like a real watchdog. She makes me leave the mail at the door. Except one time when they had these big heavy crates, she asked him Professor. She calls him Professor, what to do. So he had lugged these crates into what he calls his lab and he's got these computers in there and screens and a big operating table. Specks of blood all over the floor. - So what? Maybe he's a surgeon. - He's no surgeon, I would know. - What kind of blood was it? - Why the hell do I know what kinda blood it was? I mean blood is blood. - Those scientists, they do all kinds of experiments on guinea pigs, mice, rats. - And women. Didn't you say that, experiments on women 'til they die? (Matthieu breathing heavily) (owl hooting) (cat meowing) (cat meowing) (Matthieu chuckling) (cat meowing) - I'm wasting my time. Do I still have to wait? - Just to have a seat, Miss. The captain'll be with you in a minute. - Good morning. Anything special? - This young lady is waiting to see you. - All right. Follow me. - When and where did you last see her? - A couple of nights ago at the Paradise. - The nightclub? Ah, I see. What's your name? - Manfred Grey - [Inspector] Profession? - Salesman. - Selling what? - None of your goddamn business. What is this, a cross-examination? - Don't need to. We know who you are, Manny, and what you're selling. That's not the right word anyway, selling. Renting or leasing would be more appropriate, huh? She probably got fed up with you and took off. You got some nerve coming to the police to reclaim your means of livelihood, Mr. Manfred Grey. Get out. (typewriter clacking) But don't leave town. All stations, a kidnapping has been reported. The circumstances are doubtful. The informant is not to be trusted. (soft serene music) - Well Lysia, what do you think about that kidnapping? You heard about it, did you? It might be interesting, huh? - Mm-hmm. - We'll know more about it soon. Let's hope. (soft serene music) (birds chirping) - I don't have any further comments. Why don't you go look in the morgue? - The morgue? - You don't to have much experience, Miss. Morgue is the journalistic term for archives. Every newspaper has one. Yours too, I'm sure. Whatever you readers wanna know about me has already been printed at one time or another. - You've been the leader in your field. You're a contender for the Nobel Prize for biochemistry and you leave California to come to this hole? Not even in Paris? Why? Have you been made to quit? People talk, you know. They wonder about why you've come here, about your experiments. They wonder what goes on here. - My private life is nobody's business. Scientific research is a secret until it's published, but you could be lucky. I might give you a scoop someday soon. Maybe. Goodbye. (soft intriguing music) (fireworks crackling) (Matthieu vocalizing) - Good evening, Count Silvano. And the Countess, she's well, I hope. - She's having a wonderful time. Would you join her? Have a glass of champagne. - Thank you. (soft serene music) (guests chattering) - Come on. Come. - What do you want? - You're so beautiful. You're just too special for his husband of yours. - What are you saying? - I'm sayin' I want you to come away with me. - No, that's you who will go. You must go! - Not without you. - Hey, hey, hey. What's goin' on here? Hello? Countessa, why don't you join our guests upstairs? - Why don't you let her make her own decisions? - Why don't you let my wife go? Come on. I told you once before. You leave my wife alone. - Please, stop it! - Now I'm gonna tell you for the last time. Touch her one more time and you are dead. Steven? James? Ah. Would you escort Monsieur here out? Thank you. - Take your hands off. - Sorry, my darling. You deserve better than that. Beautiful, shall we join our guests? - Yes. - Take your hands off me. Tell your boss he's gonna pay for this. (fireworks sizzling) - I regret this incident. I truly do. Let's forget it. Let's have a good time. Let's dance. (smooth orchestral music) (fireworks sizzling) (Matthieu vocalizing) (dark retro music) - This is the ancestral book of perennial truth written with blood for the descendants of almighty and noble clan, whoever you shall be from now until Tuesday. in the presence of the deity, creator and preserver of man's transcendental spirit, I solemnly admonish you to never forget purity cannot be preserved without citing the Prince of Darkness, the arch fiend, Satan. Torture, only torture of the flesh can drive the demons from the bodies of impure and evil. - (whimpers) No! No! (weeps) No! (weeps) (dark mysterious music) - [Majordomo] Just iron. Heat the iron pliers. - Please. (weeps) No. I haven't been touched by heathens. Jesus. No! No! No. (Rosalee weeping) No. - Lucifer, the wicked one. Thou has taken possession of this miserable harlot's body. - (weeps) No. (Lysia shrieking) (fire crackling) (eerie foreboding music) No. No! No! (Lysia shrieking) (flesh sizzling) - Then this is my vow: I shall abide by all your sacred precepts. My mission is clear. I shall be the executioner of sinners who do not recant and expiate. (hooves clopping) (birds chirping) (Matthieu vocalizing) (hooves clopping) - Poaching, huh? A rabbit. Let that rabbit go, you thief. (whip smacking) (Matthieu groaning) You won't get away with it, you moron! (hooves clopping) (birds chirping) (birds chirping) (doorbell ringing) - Come in, Matthieu. Upstairs. Professor, look who's here. - Matthieu, my friend. Welcome. Come on in. - Oh nice. (Matthieu vocalizing) (both chuckling) Oh, Matthieu. (laughs) - That's good. That's magnificent. - Good, Matthieu. - That's wonderful. - How wonderful. - Be careful. Good. Thank you. Thank you very, very much. I try not to make them suffer. But sometimes, I have to because I wanna cure people who are very ill, whose blood is poisoned. See, that's why I need the animals. For their blood. New, fresh blood so I can analyze it scientifically. And thanks to today's technology, my computers may help me find out why people die. You understand? - Come on, Professor. Even I don't understand how could. You, you stay here. I get you something to eat and you get to work. - Okay. - Come on. (chuckles) (Matthieu vocalizing) - [Automated Voice] A good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. - Good. - Good - Mor. - Mor. - Ning. - Ning. Good morning. Good morning. - Good. - Good. - Mor. - Mor. Ning. - Ning. (chuckles) - [Automated Voice] Good morn. You. You. (vocalizes) You. (automated voice vocalizing) - Professor. Professor. - Ah. - Come in. - [Automated Voice] E. - [Dorine] Professor. - [Matthieu] E. E. - Matthieu, look at him. (automated voice vocalizing) (Matthieu vocalizing) - This is amazing. I'm beginning to understand something. You know first, he's afraid of people because he feels he's superior to 'em. But he's not afraid of machines, that much is very clear. And then there's the linguistic aspect. Words to him are colliding sounds. You know, sentences we speak to him are to his ear and his brain kind of an indistinct continuous noise. Now when he reacts to something we say, it's merely because he's guessing the meaning from our expressions and our gestures. Not because he's breaking down the flow of sounds into components that make sense which is the first thing an infant does. Now on the other hand, machine-produced words are isolated dictums. His brain recognizes those. Now if I could teach him to place his tongue in the right way, he might be able to reproduce them himself. Do you understand? - Not quite. All I can see that you can learn him to speak. Can you? Oh please, Professor. Do, please. - Dorine, I can try. It won't be speakin' like you and me. The best we can hope for are mono syllables, short words. But enough to make himself understood, nothing more. - Oh thank you, Professor. Thank you. (computer beeping) (people chattering) - I think it'll be really interesting tonight. I'll see you later. - Bye. (soft soothing music) - See? A. You try it. - A. - All right, now. B. B. - B. - B. - B. B. - Good. Now watch. C. - C. - All right, now. Bad man. Bad man. - Ad ban. - Mm-mmm, no. Mmm, mmm. See, put your lips. Mmm. Mmm. Man, man. - Man. - Okay. Bad man. - Bad man. - Good, good. All right, you continue. Continue. - A. B. C. Bad. (liquid burbling) (soft mysterious music) (door squeaking) (door clacking) - Are we ready? Proceed. Take the sacred scepter and begin the interrogation. (victim weeping) (retro rock music) - You will acknowledge the sins you are accused of by answering yes. - No, I will not. - If you want to live, you must confess. - Are you impure? - Yes. - Did you live in debauchery? - Yes. - Did you offer your body for sale? - Yes. - Now repeat after me: I am a whore. - I am a whore. - Now repeat: I am possessed by Satan. Repeat it! - By Satan. Possessed by Satan. - She has confessed freely, just like the others before her. Now we must deliver her from Satan. (retro rock music) - [Majordomo] You now shall be chastised. First, by the whip. - No. No, no! No! No! (whip lashing) (victim shrieking) - [Majordomo] You next shall endure the ideal of the flame. Get ready. (liquid burbling) (dark mysterious music) (owl hooting) - I'm tellin' you there's a lot of jewels in there. Look. It's Rosalee. It's Manny's girl. - It's hers. Thanks, boys. Tell Pascal and the others to get ready. Well-armed, of course at 8:00 in the morning. - Will do. - Okay, Manny. (liquid burbling) - Matthieu, I need something else. (birds chirping) (smooth jazz music) (knuckles knocking) - [Gondrand] Yes, what is it? - Miss Lysia and Mr. Harvey, sir. - [Gondrand] I'll be right there. (smooth jazz music) (birds chirping) (whip lashing) - A very beautiful riot gun. It's brand new. - You are a connoisseur, Harvey. Do you care to join me downstairs? (smooth jazz music) Please. - Scotch for you, sir? - Yes, thank you. So Countess Silvano. - Pardon me. - Thank you. She's very young. She's very beautiful. And after what happened the other night, well let's just say it's time destiny play out its hand, okay? (smooth jazz music) You can go now. (pinball machine whirring) Would you escort Monsieur here out? Out. I've told you before to leave my wife alone. Leave my wife alone. (glass shattering) (birds chirping) - Pascal, over there. You stand here. (bell tolling) - Do you hear them? They come to save this possessed woman. I have a sacred mission to remove Satan from her body and I shall succeed. (bell tolling) Don't let anyone in. - [Sam] Yes, sir. - Let me in. My girlfriend is inside. I'm tellin' you you gotta let me in. Come on. (fist bashing) (Manfred grunting) See this? Turn around. (gun smacking) (Majordomo grunting) - Sam, you follow me. (birds chirping) - Okay, boys. Over here. (gun blasting) (Manfred grunting) (guns blasting) (gun cocking) (gun blasting) (gun blasting) (Pascal grunting) (gun pattering) (explosion bursting) (birds chirping) - You okay? Give me a hand. Sam, get the others out front. (birds chirping) - Manny? (gasps) Manny. (weeps) - Shall we begin? (whip lashing) (Rosalee shrieking) (birds chirping) (hooves clopping) (Countess vocalizing) (hooves clopping) (horse whinnying) - We're lucky. (birds trilling) (dark mysterious music) - Shit. (Harvey shouting) (shrieks) Help! Lemme go! Lemme go! Help! Let me go! (horse whinnying) (shrieks) Lemme go! Let go! (birds trilling) (hooves stomping) (soft mysterious music) - [Lysia] All right, I'm off to do my part. - Monsieur (indistinct)! - Yes, Bernard? Hello. - Telegram. - Thank you. - You look nice today. - Thank you, Bernard. Look, the Countess Silvano. - How do you know her? - That outfit looks nice on her, doesn't it? I sold it to her a couple of days ago. - Hey, that's the way to the cemetery. They live on the other end of town, huh? Funny. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. (soft accordion music) - John, how are ya? Listen. Somethin' fishy's goin' on. Remember all those girls that got kidnapped? You know that guy that we were talkin' about, the professor? You know, that one that does all those experiments on those women until they die, place where I saw all the blood on the floor? - Yeah, so? - So I'll tell ya. You know the Countess Silvano? - Never heard of her. - Oh, beautiful lady. Anyway, I saw her on horseback ridin' out towards the professor's house. - Was she going inside? - I don't know. I mean no, not quite. But his house is the only house out there by the cemetery. - That don't mean a thing. - Maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't. I'd like to find out what the hell is goin' on out there. You wanna go have a look? - Yeah, okay. (intense mysterious music) (birds chirping) - [Count] Well? - This is what we found, sir. - Where? - In the forest and the Countess was seen riding through the town on the way to the cemetery. - (sighs) It's hers. I wish to call the police. (birds chirping) Count Silvano. - Excuse me. Did you say the cemetery? No. No, I agree. It couldn't be. It's at the opposite end of town. Certainly, Count Silvano. I'll alert every patrol car and every policeman on duty right away. We're bound to find some leads. Yes, sir. I'll keep you informed. Good day, sir. - Thank you. This one we will have to handle ourselves. Get to work please. - Well, well. Looks like you have something after all. Are you sure you saw the Countess? - My own eyes. - How do you know it was her? - 'Cause I recognized her, so did a lot of other people. She was on her way out there to that professor's house out by the cemetery. That's where she was murdered. Then they carried her body outta there that night by the halfwit, you know? I saw it. Hey, me and my pal Max. We saw it. - Sounds too good to be true. I think I'll have a look for myself. Gentlemen, shall we? (birds chirping) - Her riding crop was lying right here. - Let's go. (doorbell ringing) - What do you want? Mr. Roger Osborne please. - [Dorine] What for? - We'd like to speak to him. - What about? The professor is busy. - It won't take long. Just a few routine questions. I'm police Sergeant Morton. This is Captain Olivier, Lieutenant Towers. - I'll see what I can do. - Some bodyguard. He's well-protected. - There must be a reason. I wonder. Keep an eye on all the exits. No one should leave the house. - Come in. - What can I do for you, gentlemen? - We'd like to take a look around if we may. - Any particular reason? - No, Mr. Osborne. At least not yet. - Well I see. If you're gonna search my home, you have a warrant. May I see it? - You're not accused of anything. We just like to satisfy ourselves that there are not even grounds for suspicion. - You mind tellin' me what I could be suspected on? - This is a very serious matter, Mr. Osborne. Two women have disappeared in the last few days: a hostess in a nightclub and a rather prominent and wealthy woman. - (chuckles) And I'm supposed to have kidnapped 'em? - Well go ahead, see if you can find 'em. Unless you can identify Dorine here as a hooker or a jet-set beauty. - Sergeant, look. There's blood. (liquid burbling) - What's the origin of this blood, Mr. Osborne? - An operation needed for my research. - On animals? - Well don't tell me you suspect that I'm operating on people. On those two ladies maybe, huh? - Not yet. I might remind you that vivisection is illegal unless you- - The search for scientific truth has often been illegal. Galileo was condemned of saying the earth rotates around the sun instead of vice versa. - What sort of animals, Mr. Osborne? - The usual, Sergeant. A cat, a dog, a mouse and occasionally a rabbit. - I see. Take a sample, Towers. You're under arrest, Mr. Osborne. You'll be coming with us. Experts will determine the nature of this blood. - You really think that's human blood? - Last night a man was seen leaving your house carrying a sack with a human body inside. - My god, that was Matthieu with a dead dog. - If that's the case, our investigation will show it. - No, I'll prove it myself. I'll find Matthieu and he'll show me where he buried the dog. - We'll analyze the blood first. - All right, Sergeant. I'll get my coat. May I pass? (liquid burbling) - Stop. Stop or I'll shoot! (gun pattering) - What happened? Oh, Christ. I better call the precinct. (soft romantic music) (glasses clinking) - It's perfect. - Thank you. - Absolutely perfect. (glasses clinking) So tell me, how did it go? - Uneventful. I did have a good ride or should I say, the Countess did. I rode through the city to the cemetery and a little further. Lots of people saw me, so I don't think anyone will suspect that she's your guest. - That's wonderful. Didn't she have a riding crop? - I must've lost it in the forest. - I think you better find it. Find it now. (bell tolling) Don't let anyone in. Understood? - What's happening? - The man says nothing doing. We can't go inside. - Is that right? We wish to enter, Monsieur. (fist bashing) (Majordomo grunting) Get your weapons. - Get upstairs and take care of this. C'mon. - Okay. - You too, Harvey. - Yes, sir. - [Gondrand] Sam, get the others. (gun blasting) (Bernard shouting) (gun blasting) (John wincing) - Count Silvano, come up here. (both grunting) (fist bashing) - [Gang Member] Hey you. - C'mon, come on, come on. (group grunting) C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. (fist bashing) (group grunting) (hand smacking) (gun cocking) - You wanted to visit our secret chambers, now's your chance. Right now. - An unexpected pleasure to see you here. - Where's my wife? - It's so sad watching a man like you desperately trying to hold onto his wife. It's a sin, you know? Harvey, bring the gentleman to see his wife. (soft mysterious music) (dark mysterious music) - Darling. - You all right? - I'm so afraid. - Harvey, show the gentleman to a front-row seat. - Move. - [Leader] Sam. - Sit down. (soft intriguing music) (ground crunching) - Matthieu! Matthieu. Goddammit, where are you? Son of a bitch. (birds chirping) They're gone? - They'll be back, you can be sure. - Well they're gonna arrest me. I couldn't find him. - He's right here having coffee. - He's what? - Here. - Oh thank god. Go get him. - Yeah. Matthieu, the professor is here. Tell him exactly what you told me. Matthieu, where did you bury the dog? (Matthieu barking) No, don't bark. You know how to say the name. Dog. D-O-G. - Dog. - Good. Where did you bury it? Well then what did you do with it? Water, water. Long, the river. (Matthieu vocalizing) You through the sack in the river. (hands slapping) Again. (hands slapping) (Matthieu grunting) A horse. (hands slapping) What about the horse? (Matthieu groaning) Captured. Somebody was captured, taken off a horse. A lady with long hair. (Matthieu vocalizing) A lady with long hair and a horse. A Jeep. (Matthieu vocalizing) Who was in the Jeep? I'm gonna call the police. This is Dr. Osborne. I'm home. (phone banging) (birds chirping) - Good, you're back. I knew you'd come to your senses. No tricks now. Let's go. - Wait, wait. We know what happened. The kidnappings, everything. - How would you know? Oh, I forgot. Tell 'em. - He will tell. - You're wasting my time. This halfwit can't even talk. - He's not a halfwit. He's a human being. His name is Matthieu. - Sure, Matthieu can tell. And if it's anything you don't understand, the professor or I will translate. Go on, Matthieu. Tell the Sergeant what you've seen. Go. - The Countess? (Matthieu vocalizing) (hands slapping) - A horse. (Matthieu vocalizing) - No hair, bald. (Matthieu shouting) (Matthieu groaning) They took her in a car. (Matthieu vocalizing) You followed. (dark mysterious music) - Why don't you get started? - (chuckles) Soon you'll be like her, Countess. - No. - [Harvey] Vizier please. - Pleasure. (match striking) - Oh no. No. Don't. (weeps) (bell tolling) - What grounds do we have to search this place? Just this idiot's say-so doesn't make sense. - I believe what he told us. - You call that pantomime telling? Well let's try to get inside and have a look. Towers, ring it again. (bell tolling) (phone buzzing) - [Gondrand] Yes, what is it? - It's the police Captain, a Sergeant or an Inspector. Yes, yes and some cops. What shall I do? - Stall them for a few minutes. I'll be right up. You understand? - Yes, sir. - Sam, Harvey, Lysia. Shall we go upstairs to greet our guests? - Untie me. (Rosalee wincing) Untie me. - Help me. Please. Help me. (weeps) - [Majordomo] Please, gentlemen. (soft serene music) (pinball machine clacking) - Good afternoon, gentlemen. And to what do I owe this unexpected pleasure? - We'd like to have a word with you. - Well my guests and I have just sat down for a drink. Would you care to join us? - No, thank you. - Of course not. Well tell me, what exactly is it I can do for you? - We'd like to take a quick look around your house. - Certainly. I can't imagine why. I'm sure you have your own reasons. Where would you like to start? Here in the living room, the library, upstairs in the master bedroom perhaps? Guest room, servant's quarters. Your choice. - [Towers] Our choice? Then why didn't you suggest the cellar? - We'd like to look in your cellar if we might. - Nothing down there that would be of any interest to you. - Then you won't mind if we take a look for ourselves. - Be my guest. (table crashing) (fist bashing) (window shattering) - Go. (gun blasting) (Towers grunting) (gun pattering) (Harvey wincing) - Bastard. (gun blasting) (Olivier grunting) (gun blasting) (Lysia wincing) (Roger grunting) - It's too late. Get down. (key clanking) (intense foreboding music) (gun blasting) - Shit. - Finally. They are together, hmm? - [Countess] Don't touch me, you fiend. - [Rosalee] Let us out of here. - [Countess] Don't touch me. I hate you. - Finally. - Don't kill him! He should be brought to court and tried. - Don't! (bones cracking) (Gondrand wincing) (Matthieu chuckling) - Bad man dead. Good. (laughs) (romantic orchestral music)
