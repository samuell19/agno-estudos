Doors are open, you know the deal. Come on, I'll get you a little pick-me-up. This isn't good. Well, this is. Best part of waking up, bourbon in your cup. - There you go, brother. - Thank you. Get any sleep last night? Tomorrow, tomorrow... tomorrow, creeps in this petty pace from day to day. On this spot in 2016, Michael slept it off. Last day with him. What's he gonna do, where is he gonna go? - I mean, come on. -That's actually a very good question. I can't imagine that dude functioning without this place, but... guess he'll have to figure it out. All right. - I'm sorry. - Aw. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come here. I'm sorry. - All right, buddy, no worries. - Thank you. Glad to see you among the living again. You look much better. You feeling any better? Sure, let's say yes. That's good. I didn't touch any of your stuff. I... I know, I didn't... I know. All right, buddy. - See you tomorrow. - I probably... That's a lot more sun than I usually see. - What's the... um... - Sorry. Fucking last day in paradise, huh? Honestly, what does this bar make? So you're going down... so you're going down to $85 a day, who cares? - Stay open. -Probably gonna turn into a CVS anyway. All right, anyway. I'm going to go get the decorations. All right, please do. - Oh, lookie-lou. - Good morning. I can't believe John's here, I can't believe it. What are the odds? Oh, and he has doughnuts! Look at that! Ask and ye shall receive! - Forget the sandwich. - Fuck the sandwich! - Give me the fucking doughnuts! - Good man. John, just in the nick of time, coming through with doughnuts. Oh, God, this thing weighs about 40 pounds. I really do have to go get the decorations. Try not to hurt yourself. - How are you doing today, man? - Good. Can you put that somewhere? Yeah, yeah, will do. - Do I want to know what's in there? -Nope. You know what they say at the airport? If you see something say something? The whole, like, unmarked bag situation? See nothing, saw nothing. For more on what's gonna happen, we go to Yasmeen Hassan. Now we are just a few hours away from Carnado. If you're heading south on the 15, and you need to head off in that general direction, I would hop off at Lake Mead and then take MLK over and then that'll connect you over to 95. So, all of this starts at 10 p.m. tonight and it's going to stay in place until February. You really hit the ground running today, Michael. I... I know we're making fun, but... - Aren't we always? - I pride myself... I pride myself on not having become an alcoholic until after I was already a failure, because alcoholic failures are boring. That's actually... And I ruined my life sober, and then I came to you. We got you at the prime... we got you at the prime of your life, man. So you're saying the alcohol didn't ruin your life. Keith Richards looks at you and wonders how you're still alive. That was the sound of your point being rejected by the judges. - That is... -We're going to have to go to the judges. - Hello! - Brothers! You're just in time for the not-party. We're not having fun in celebration of not closing. Hey, I'm leaving, I'll catch you all later. Like, what else is new? Welcome to the rant. - Michael's just getting started. - Oh my God. All right, this is... this is... this is... I'm really almost done. - You look good. - Not yet, but I wish I was. Success is not something that you're responsible for. You know, success will happen or it won't happen, largely due to forces outside your control. - Really? - Largely, not exclusively. There are people who can bull their way through to success. - But by and large... - Hard work and all that. By and large, it's a matter of luck and timing and... All right, thank you, at least there's one point. So all you can do, all you can be responsible for, is not becoming a joke before you go. And... Oh, shit. Jesus, Lowell. Fuck you, man. Fucking asshole. A new car! Thank you so much. Mark-Paul Gosselaar... Y'all remember Wolfman? Hell yeah. - Oh my gosh. - Oh, look, we got the... Can I get... can I get some more coffee, please? - Michael. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're a man of small... little words. Well then string up some goddamn tape, you got the party shit right there. Here, blow some of these up. Ain't gonna happen. I got no lungs. Well, I don't scare easy, but God dammit, that Carnado is scaring the piss out of me. - I don't mind... - I heard that. You know, I woke up this morning, it was like, it's a nice sunny day. - It's on its way. -It's like we're all fucked, man, you know? And the world's largest gift shop just got sold. This place is fucking shutting down. Well, they saw Carnado coming. That's it, yeah, yeah, that's it. You got it. The Bonanza Gift and Souvenir Shops sold. You know, I don't even care about this town anymore. - They're losing their character. - I hear you, I hear you, dude. -The world, it's... -Fucking Celine Dion can have it, I'm moving. Stay right there. Stay right there. I'm gonna... I want to see if they'll come here. I know, I'm working on it. I'm sorry. Listen to this, Michael. Write it down in your precious little notebook that I won't touch. ♪ You got to know when to hold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪ ♪ Know when to walk away ♪ ♪ And know just when to run ♪ - Or shut the fuck up. - ♪ You never count your money when you're sitting at the table ♪ ♪ There'll be time enough for counting ♪ ♪ When the dealing's done ♪ Yeah, yeah! - All right. -I did, I listened to every bit of it. Thank you, 20's, it's been a good God knows how many fucking years. But I'm out. I'm gonna take this here guitar, go out to Reno and make dozens of dollars. - Well, that certainly helps. - Did you bring your cello? No, you know I don't bring that shit near you animals. American Pie! So, Marc, when you become rich and famous, you gonna share? - Huh? - Yeah. - You gonna share? - Share what? - When you become rich and famous? -Your money. - Yeah, I'll bring you guys a couple bucks. -Hundredaire? Don't forget, that's all I'm saying. You're the man, you're the man. It's another word for a crucifix or cross. - Good. - What the fuck is that? like "Cactus Makes Perfect." - Yes. -Three of a Kind for $800. You got me there. - Oh! -...appear in this book of the Old Testament. - Daniel, right. -Three of a Kind for $1000. Are we the smartest people alive? The pop music needs to come back on. - ...who determined human destiny. -He picked eight. - The muses? - The fates. What are we watching this for, to feel stupider? I already had to deal with these clowns. Alex Trebek, you smug son of a bitch. Sherwin-Williams Fireweed is close. - Yes. -Native Americans for $200. The name of this tribe, the USA's largest, comes from a word meaning "planted fields," since they were farmers. U.S.'s largest tribe, the Navajo. I know you gotta shave in the sink in the morning, but make sure you rinse down the hair. - It's okay! - No, I'm sorry, man. That's all right, man, you look good, you look good. I finished my sandwich, I'm saving a little bit for later on. Okay. Jeez, you guys are really knocking these signs out the park. We're gonna have a lesson in handwriting as soon as we're done. I never thought I'd say it, but Lowell's got the best handwriting so far. You know what, I'm gonna tell y'all a little joke. Alright, tell me your joke. - Ready for it. - Okay. I'm gonna tell you something. You can root high and die a poor pig. And a heap see, but a few know what's going on. Now listen to what I said. A heap of people see, but a few know what's going on. - A "frew"? - We know what's going on. - A fruit? - The Carnado's... I ain't said no fruit. You... you act like you got carbonation milk behind your ears. I said a few. - A few. -Okay, okay, is this like a riddle? Uh, no. F-E-W. A few know what's going on. -A few know what's going on. -So could you say the whole thing again? A heap see but a few know... what's going on. A heap of people see but a few people know what's going on. A heap of people see, but a few know what's going on. -That's sage wisdom. -Yeah, say it inside out, then it will be like Yoda. - Right, you have to reverse everything. -Yes. I can say it backwards. Everybody sees but... ...fall to pieces... ...again... Buttons, the whole fucking thing is about buttons now. All right. You ain't about to close, are you, yet? Uh, yeah, but just for you, man. Everyone else can stay. I love you, man. I think I'm getting a call from someone who needs a beer, - but the unfortunate thing is... - I won't do that anymore, maybe. Senses. That's something I appreciate. - Yeah. - You wake up in the morning and you go outside, and you smell the dew on the grass and it has a real... To me, a very nice smell. It awakens your senses, and all of a sudden, maybe you feel like you're just part of everything. Right, right. That... that is beauty, and actually, I... you're making me realize I haven't smelled that smell in a long time. I... I don't know if that's 'cause I'm not waking up at the right time of day or because my sense of smell is shot, but I haven't smelled that in a long time. Me too. Every now and then, it works. But, um, when I first started being an actor, it's like I was always after truth, I was after truth, I wanted the truth of every scene, I wanted the truth of every line. You sucked every time, that's why no one hired you. After I'd been doing it for a while, um, I kind of realized that truth... - Even if you did find it... - Bruce, you all right over there by your lonesome self? And so I started going after beauty instead. I... I started going after... I started going after what pleases the eye... Shoot yourself in the fucking forehead! Pleases the spine. - Your spine? Get a pistol and... - When something goes up the back of your spine. Get a pistol and shoot yourself! - What is that? - You're an idiot! Uh oh, somebody was not nice. - Ira. - Sorry. Yeah, yeah. And there is some truth to that... Dumbass. Huh? - What's it called? - Long Day's Journey into Night. That wasn't me! Is this a real thing, is this really happening? 20's? Yes, it is. Thank you for asking how I'm doing. Thank you. What's going on? What do you... Ira, there's a call for you, homeboy. What... what's going on, what do you need? Yeah, hold on. Ira, you gotta go to work, dude. Where? Let me deal with him. I'll get him out the door, I promise. All right, thanks, bye. Ira, I got terrible news for you, man, which I also can't believe, but you're apparently supposed to be at work someplace right now. Where am I working at? All right. See, he believed me. It's probably the first person who did. Ira. What? You gotta go to work. Can I finish my drink first? You can take this one with you. Take this one with you. Which one do you want? Here, look, I'll pour it in a cup for you. Look, I don't like being the bearer of bad news. I don't like answering this phone for any reason, actually. Where do I gotta work at? - Huh? - Where do I gotta work at? Can we get subtitles on him? Where has he gotta work at? And maybe find a travel agent, 'cause they have all the inside information. There are so many choices to consider, from the style of the cruise to the destination. Uh, I have a strategy to cruising, Sean. Okay, I get onboard, I go to my room, I drop my luggage. -Then, I'm out of the room, I'm out. -No, we gotta do a run... Hey, Felix, what kind of deals you got for me today, man? This deals, that deals, drug deals. Well, there's a bit of a rush right now, so I'll try to hold your chair for you. Can I give you a hand? Which way is the bathroom? It's on the left. - To the left. - Hell yeah. Second door on the left. See, when you in a platoon, I don't care what color, race you is, it don't have nothing to do with that. - No. -Like, you in my platoon with me, and something happen to you, and you get killed, it's like something died in me, 'cause you were my friend. You had my back and I had yours. So... You supposed to feel glad about it? No, I didn't feel glad about it. A lot of 'em didn't come back. A whole bunch of 'em. I lost count. But I made it back. My man. Marc? I might be calling you. Yeah, all right. Well, let me know, I'm ready. Is it someone in the building? God dammit, Lowell. Hey, we'll put... we'll put the cab ride on the bar, how's that sound? It's been nice, man. I'm fucked up. I know. They... they got you covered. You know what I remember about this place? You're good, you're good. Ira, Ira, you can't sit back down. - I'm good. - You can't sit back down. It's time to go. - Your beer is finished. - It's all gone, yeah. You finished everything. - Ira, it's over. - Okay. That's it for the day. That's it for the day. Come on. Come on. Straight out. Yeah, you're getting there, bud. Let's do it. Little bit further. - Good man. - I know. Little bit further. Hey, can we get that car for Ira? Alright... Will I see you tomorrow? See you tomorrow? Who the fuck knows, bro? Well, I'll be here if you'll be here. Good luck, man. - No. - It's the last fucking day. I can fuck with him. -I'm pleased we all know the rules to this game. -I'm a paying customer here, aren't I? If it's the last day, then you get berated all day. If you sing this good, I won't ever insult you again. I'm not gonna sing this well, are you kidding me? Well, don't make him sing. - He's starting. - No pressure. Come on!

Long time no see. - Looking for... - Welcome to the party. - Thank you. -Did you see Michael's decorations? Look how good a job he's doing. - Wow. - Right? A special occasion, you know? Can I get a Bud Light please? Of course you can. Hi, yeah! I've been looking all over for you. Well, baby, you found me. You look so pretty. Can I sit in this chair? A government that is tone deaf to citizens. And they've got real hope on this guy. And I'm listening to people from my own community who are scared to death because they don't... they don't trust him. Why should all of our hope be in one person and not in each other? Oh, wait, that was yours. Sorry, man, I'm sorry. See how far it'll go. I can't wait to see who this is. - Rikki! - Oh my God. Rikki! Stop, you stop, you stop. - Oh my God, how are you? - Hi! Where else would you be? - We can drink now, Rikki's here. - What have you been up to? Well, um... oh my God, um... I... I'm working a lot. Um, I'm acting a little. - Yes. -And, uh, today I'm drinking a lot. High five! Fixing to go get me a nice, nice, little, juicy cocktail. Juicy cocktail! You look really spectacular. -You look really spectacular. - Those were the, uh, carnado... - I work a lot. Yeah, you do. I work more than most, I'm happy. - I got till, like, five. - Oh, okay, all right, all right. It is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome to see you. Yeah, no, I... when he told me you were in... When he told me you were coming down, I was so fucking thrilled. - Yeah. - I was so fucking thrilled, 'cause I... 'cause I've missed you. And your sweetheart, you've been like five years, right? - No, eight years. - Eight years, eight years? Damn, I didn't... - I know, time flies, doesn't it? - Oh, damn. And I've never... I don't think I've ever even met him. What's his name? - Brian. - Ryan or Brian? - Brian. - Brian, okay. Well, sooner or later, sooner or later... - I'm glad you came back. - I am the worst fucking... It's been waiting on you. - Just picked it up. - What did I say? - A lot has happened. - Yeah, yeah. Well, you and I haven't been in touch. Right. Are you still... are you still cooking? - Absolutely. - All right, I'll find you there. - You can come by. - I might, I might. - Definitely. - At least for a stop by. - Yes! -Okay, you know, I need your phone number, 'cause I have... I lost that two cell phones ago. Well, you got me on Facebook. Yeah, that's true. All right, John's taking his pants off. Does anyone have a problem with that? John wants to take his pants off. John wants to take his pants off? All right. Okay, I feel like taking my pants off. Well, OK. I feel much better. Thank you, John. Feel much better. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I know. What kind of a... What kind of a party is it if an Australian guy doesn't take his pants off? I've been saying that for years. Rikki, come on back after your show. All right. I'll sing a duet with you if you come back after your show. Okay, now if you're gonna threaten me, I'm not coming. It's the plumber. I've come to fix the sink. Shay, woo! Shay! - Hey. - There's my girl. How you doing? Did Rikki go out the back? - Hi sweetie. - Hey, how are you? How's my baby boy? - I love you. - He's good. Um, actually I'm pissed off at him. I tell you what, this is getting complicated. - Shay looks more motivated. - There we go. Here we go. And Marc's bartending career ends on a whimper rather than a bang.

He came in at 3 AM this morning for the first time in his life, and looked at me like, "What?" but there's a no parking sign and a traffic cone in my backyard... ...with their names in Sharpie on it. But I know that they better not be out again, and I got the gate keys and they're not allowed to get it. And I'm putting those Coke bottles that are broke on top of it or something like them other people do. Oh! Like, I don't know what to do with him right now. All I can do is love him and worry.

You will, trust me. All right, now we're gonna have to wait for a minute 'cause this... Whatever this is is gonna have to finish playing. Okay, but I don't have to wear a hat. No, you don't have to wear a hat. That wasn't part of the deal. You're all right, baby. You're all right, baby. You gonna be all right tonight? - I'm gonna be fine. - Oh, don't... oh, man. Tired of being here. Nothing to hold me back anymore. He's gone, Tra's good, I'm ready. Been here too long. Man, and you got to do it too. - Gots to. - Got to. - I'm excited. - I was... I was able to do that and I just enjoyed the hell out of it. Where'd you go? Well, when I was... twenty-three maybe, two or three or four, two, three, four, and they put me... my first seven years, I had 27 different addresses, and they were all over the Southeast. And then I went to Los Angeles and Denver. It was hard on marriages, don't get me wrong, but it was fun like a sumbitch. How many times you been married? I... uh, legally twice. How many was pretend? It was like... it was like a couple, it was three or four or five? I would think, that would be my first guess. Jesus. You know, little mistakes like that are okay. It's okay to fuck up. It's okay to be wrong. It's okay, you just wipe the slate clean and... What did you write down? Pam, Pam? Pam, what did you write down on the board? The board that they erased, what did you write down that got erased? - Nothing! -Nothing, you had nothing you regretted? - No. - They wasted that board? When I was a kid, I wrote on the chalkboard, "What do you wanna do when you grow up?" I said, "Be immature." So I already wrote mine down when I was five. - What did you do? - Did they erase that? No, I was already immature. That was my dream in life. The American dream. Immature. That's me. Dumb blonde, stupid Pam. You know what? It's all good. I have more fun than all of y'all ever have in your life. I doubt that. Come on! Kamari! Oh, that's my little brother! Hi darling, I'll be right with you. And that's my bigger brother. I ain't really that much bigger. - Uh huh. - I'm a little bit bigger. A little bit. How you doing, baby? You look so handsome. Thank you, I feel beautiful today. Good. God damn, you look awesome. - Hey darling. - Hi. - Thank you. - Those are for you? Last time I got the couch, but I don't know if she got the bed, 'cause you didn't invite me to the bed. - The couch here? - Gave me the couch. His couch or this couch? Because this couch is my couch. No, he told me his couch. So what city is Melbourne, like, if you could compare it to, like, an American city? - New York. - New York, okay. All right. Doesn't sound bad though. I want to ask you something. - Okay. - Come here. I mean, just imagine New York in proximity to kangaroos. What's up with the brown bag? Don't ask about the brown bag. I'll get it from you at some point, and that will be that. I am part of the most fucking entitled, selfish, privileged generation ever to ruin the planet. And... yeah, I personally am a big loser on that one. I'm sorry, I... I overslept one morning and... I overslept one morning and the bottom fell out of manufacturing. I'm really sorry. Is it your fault that my Cadillac is so shitty? Uh, no, that wasn't me. That was my neighbor. Your neighbor? I... I listen to people bitch about how entitled and whiny and privileged twenty-somethings are, and fuck that, fuck that. The only way this planet is gonna survive maybe is if everybody my age and older dies before everything is destroyed. Not the planet, but the species. - You're right about... - Whichever, the planet... The planet will go on happily without us, but, uh, you're right, for humans to do well, y'all need to go. If would mercy kill me tonight, that would be good. You know what, I'm gonna... I got a few things I'm gonna say about it. Say I'm a trillionaire, billionaire, whatever. And I pay for all my campaigns... Don't need the money. Don't know a damn thing about politics. Do you think he will make a good president? I'm gonna tell you right... Trump. - Trump? - Yeah. You know what's gonna happen? Two things gonna happen. They will either impeach his ass or somebody gonna assassinate him just like they did Kennedy. - The thing... -I'm... you... you're interrupting me. - I'm sorry. -I'm telling you what's gonna happen. Okay, I'm glad you know. A heap see, but a few know. And I'm just telling you what I know. You got the United States sending them our firepower. - Good cooking? - Yeah. - Good company? - Yeah. - Some wine. - Plenty of beer. It's Thanksgiving every day. - Every day. - Every day. Every day. Fuck the turkey, let's eat some steak. Fuck the steak, let's drink some beer and smoke some weed and drink some beer. Tomorrow's another day. - Tomorrow's another day. - Tomorrow's another day. And let all these kids figure it out themselves, - But they're smoking weed and drinking beer too. -I know. But they're not listening to us. They never had it hard like we did. They never had to go out and milk the goats and go out and bail hay. -I never had it hard. -And they never had to fucking load hay bails. They never had to work like we did, none of them, not one of 'em. We worked hard. They don't even know what work is. God, how did that... how did that beer get so empty so fast? -'Cause when you get in the military, you can get a... -Same here, that's why I went. You can get a better education... Well, I mean, that's what they... that's what the government like to sell us, like, "Come fight for us, we'll 'take care of you.'" - Not to fight, hey, just hang out. -Yeah. What it... what it was for me in 2000, "Hey, just hang out here, we're gonna teach you some cool skills, you'll get to serve your country, no wars." Last thing that happened was the Cole. You're fine, everything's fine. And then next thing you know, you're in war for 15 years. Yeah. Horseshit. Stupid wars, mostly. We liked it, though. It's good for a lot of people. It's good for people. I'm glad I did it. I learned a lot. You like it, I love it. I'm glad I did it. All right, boys, I'll be back. Twenty dollars, who's got Adderall? No one? No one's got Adderall? And why is it you need money again? Um, we need extra chips. Mm-hm. - Oh really? - I bet. I love you. I seen that cigar wrapper outside. You didn't see nothing. Thank you for checking in.

And when you lost your wife... Listen. I don't want to go there and I don't want to hurt you. I lost my son, you lost her. We have stuff in common. The biggest thing that meant anything to us. And you've always been there. And I love her. I'm gonna tell you this. You know what, I gotta tell you. I'm not over her yet. - I'm not. -I lost my son and you picked me up. Then you lost her. And you never quit caring about me and I wasn't there for you. I wish I could have been. I wish I could have been there like you were for me. You were there for me and I wasn't there for you. I wish I would have been there for you like you were there for me. - It's all right. - You're so special. "Hey Paul, can you get me some toilet paper? I got a bad situation here!" Sure. Holy shit. Where is that... where's that balloon that says "the end"? Let me get you right in front of this, where it says "the end." Hang on, hang on. Uh, uh, uh, what are... uh! You are... Profile, profile.

It only takes five ounces of plutonium to change the balance of the earth. And some of these countries... yeah, but some of these, including us, us alone, we own over, like, fucking... it's a lot of fucking plutonium. The white trash fucking garbage person that I am, that's what I fucking want. - You want us to have Fireball. - Fuck yeah I do. You think I'm better than Fireball? I'm not. You don't look 60. - Yeah, I'm 60. - You don't look it. Look at my titties. Oh, wow! Sixty-year-old titties. Those don't... don't seem like 60... Sixty. I'm 60 years old. Those are not...

They look really... those are good titties. - Really? - Those are good titties. - So I'm not fallen yet? - No, those are good titties. - You should be proud of those. - I've see nutsacks farther than that. Nutsacks are... an eight-year-old's nutsacks look worse than your titties. I divorced a man one time because his nutsack hung down past his dick. -That's crazy. -Oh, it was the saggiest fucking nuts I ever saw. He didn't exercise enough. - I didn't... - You know what you gotta do? - Look. - That's some bad nuts. When I grew up, they said, "We must, we must, we must improve our bust. The bigger the better, the tighter the sweater. And you do it every day, you get titties like this when you're 60. -I mean, the titties, those are nice titties. -You're into titties now?

Leave me a message. Hey, baby, I made it back to the bar, everything's all good, and I'm fixing to stay here till we all done dancing on down the road, bye. You didn't come here to take a nap.

I am, most definitely. Well, come straight up. I mean, it's so boring for me to listen to this. Give me your best, man. Just tell the girl what you want and she'll tell you yes or no. I'm also saying, like, you need to get your ass out there, you got a lot of people that really like you and that...

I'm telling you, I already got it in here. How you bring me in that shit? Indeed, many of us know many names. So it's not surprising that some would have us stay at home a little longer to rest, to wait. In this city of sin, here, this state of Nevada, this grand faded oubliette of these United States was not built by them who wanted and rested... You can't even read. I can too read, Bruce. I ain't say you can't read, I said you can't read that. This country was conquered by those who moved forward, and so will we. - Say that. - I did say it. Do it. Give me your card. I wrote this earlier. I know you wrote it. But why, some say, the bar? Why this bar? - Why do we identify this as our joint? -I don't know why. - Comfort. - I don't know. - Comfort, maybe. - Comfort. - What else? - Comfort. - Oh, my God. - Accessibility. - And... - Comfort and accessibility. It's alcohol, it's the alcohol mostly. It's all right, it's the alcohol and it's... I'm gonna tell you what else it is. It's a place where you can go when nobody else don't want your ass. Motherfucker, it's in there, I got it worked in there. That's where it's at. When nobody else don't want your ass, you can come in here and have a good time. Nobody want my ass, so that's why I'm in here. We must find somewhere else to get drunk. Thanks to technology, the drinks are inside of us. Thanks to Shay. Yay! I've done my job. We ask God's blessing on this, our last and hopefully our best evening. - Is the last page? - I think so. - Except, for me... - Oh, shit.

Everything you say to me is an insult. - You are older. - Yeah. That's the number one issue. The number one reason I'm older... I'm mad at you is because you're old... old guy. - Right. - And I think your generation destroyed my country. How young is your grandkids? I don't have grandkids. I don't have kids, I don't have grandkids. I look after old ladies and I clean houses and I contribute to my world and fuck you. Now you can blame me generationally as much as you want, and it's appropriate to do so, because my generation fucked up. But if you continue... If you continue to condense... -I'm ready...

You gonna drive? I'm thinking about it. Are you sure? None of that shit was my fault. That was fuckin' Pete. Let me see how the keyhole feels. I could drive if you want me to. Uh... Man, you're not particularly adept when you're sober. I mean, you just tried to fight a man with eyes tattooed on his eyelids. That doesn't mean I'm drunk, that means I'm right. I don't wanna drive. I've spent way more time in church than all of you motherfuckers this week. You out? - Even me? - John? Happy trails. We have a huge slowdown on the 15 specifically the slowdown right now in the southbound direction. The lane restriction's in place in both directions, so right now the backup is... Are you hungry at all or no? No, but I wouldn't mind a piece of cake. I got french fries, I'm just eating this and french fries. So what's that, a milkshake? - I know, but... -They're very hot, so be careful. - I know... - Thank you so much. Okay, how are you doing? And that piece of chocolate cake over there, when you get a chance. What kind of milkshake: strawberry, chocolate, or vanilla? - Vanilla, vanilla. - You want vanilla? Okay. You want... and you want whipped cream then, right? - The sweeter the better. - Yeah, okay. Just keep adding to it, don't worry. Y'all, I've been sitting here this whole time thinking that palm tree is real. And I think it's a fucking light. It is, it's a fucking fake light. Yo. Yo. Hello, darlin', this is Louis, darlin'... I'm freaking fried. Me too. Yes, Dana and Beth, I feel like you're gonna agree with me, "I remember when Planet Hollywood used to be the Aladdin," and anyone who lives in Las Vegas for a while has those kinds of memories, so construction, nothing unusual for us, but Clark County says that the amount of construction... Hey, darlin'. Hey. Michael. Michael. You gotta get up. Time to go. Come on. Oh, I'm sorry. -Come on, let me get you something to drink. -I gotta clean up, I gotta clean up. Let me go... I... I...

Jesus. Is John gone? Everybody's gone, boo. Thought about going to the Carolinas. Have you ever been to Myrtle Beach? Yeah, I've got family that's staying out there right now. I'm about to move to Oregon. I don't know, Virginia Beach is really nice. I don't like the pebbles in the sand. Really? See, I really liked it, I enjoyed it. People are very nice there. You gonna be okay drivin'? You don't know nothin' about me, do you? Huh? I don't know, maybe I'll go to Spain and watch those bulls. That sounds cool. - Can I come? - Absolutely. You know you would never leave all this. I will miss the holidays here. It's just special, everybody always comes out and... You had a nice place here.
