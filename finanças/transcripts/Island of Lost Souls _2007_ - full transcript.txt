ISLAND OF LOST SOULS COPENHAGEN 1871 Two. - How did you capture him? - He came for the Lodge Book. Aren't you afraid he'll wake up? No, no. We've given him a sedative strong enough for ten men! Before us we have a necromancer - - who has made a pact with Evil. His mind is so twisted with malice - - his soul so consumed by black magic - - that he can scarcely call himself human. Therefore the Lodge has decided that he must cease to exist. In the name of the Book of the Lodge. Give me strength. Annihilate evil ... Annihilate evil ... So you think I should cease to exist? Let's see how you feel about it now. The Lodge Book! Wait, Herman, you're not strong enough! Herman, you must be powerful in order to use the magic of the Lodge Book. Linea? MANY YEARS LATER 1st Division, you go this way; 2nd Division, that way. The enemy is lying in wait. Don't go in there, soldier. Stop! - Sylvester! - It's your own fault if you die. That goes in the living room. Put that out before you go in, okay? Sylvester, help Lulu unpack the stuff in your room. Why me , when she won't do it? Lulu! Do people actually live in this town? People dine early in the country. Would you mind helping out ... ? Hello! Is anyone there? Boo! You should've seen yourself! - You're so childish. - Yeah, right! You believe in ghosts. "Uhh ... Hello ... ? Is anyone there?" Come on, Oliver, there's only a few miles left. Open up, Lulu. Come on, Oliver! Pull yourself together. You want him to sit and play computer games all day? Come on. - Come on, honey. - Hep-hep! Come on! - No way! Where's TV2 Zulu? - We don't get all the channels out here. But the coolest award show is on tonight! - German TV ... Awesome! - Relax! - I'm moving back to the city. - Okay. Bye-bye. "If restless souls exist in this place - "- may this calling lend you a voice." "Find your way through the darkness and the rain. "Come through the shadows and give me a sign." Just this once, let something happen. Anything! Please? Hi, honey. Any contact? Shouldn't you spend less time with the dead and more with the living? Like who ? We've just moved to the most boring place in all of Denmark. I think we'll be happy living in the country. Away from noise, and stress and grumpy people. You mean away from Dad. It wasn't me who ran off with some 25-year-old secretary. He only left because you were always such a pain! Why are you defending him? He doesn't visit. He never calls. - What is it about him that's so great? - Just leave me alone! Get in here, Sylvester. I don't want to hear that ball anymore. - Lulu? - Mmm ... ? - There's something in the closet. - Yeah, right. Lulu ... Now there's a strange light. Do you really think I'll fall for that? Shut up and let me sleep. Lulu! Sylvester, what the hell are you doing? Pardon me? Go to sleep! I'm going to the hospital now. Remember not to use the stove. Otherwise the fuses will blow again. Hello? Yes, hi ... No, it's still not working. Sylvester ... Hello? - What's the name of that island? - Monk Island. - How do you get out there? - You can't. It's private property. They even have guard dogs. - Help us. - We're trapped. Help us. - Help us. - Set us free. I know you can hear me. - Help me. - Set us free. - We're trapped. - Set us free. Help us. I can't do anything! I can't help you! Come on, Oliver. Pull yourself together. Hey ... Aren't you gonna jump? No. I uh ... want to sunbathe. - It's closer to the sun. - Okay. - Always run with your mom and dad? - My step-dad. He's an exercise freak. Are you sure you don't want to come down? No, no ... This is perfect. You should try it. Hope you get a nice tan! Turn off the TV when you're done watching. Sylle. It wasn't very smart, but he wanted his vacation now - - so I have to take a lot of night shifts, already starting this week. - What have you been up to today? - Took a walk. Very informative. Thank you. Remember what you said yesterday about the strange light in our room? I have no such recollection, no. I think I will retire for the evening. Good night. - What are you doing here? - I was just going for a walk. Shh! I'm following my kid brother. And why, exactly, are we spying on your brother? Do you believe in the supernatural? - I think my brother's been possessed. - Possessed by what? - I can't help you! - Listen! Help us ... I can't help you! Leave me alone! Help us. Leave me alone! - What the hell was that ? - How should I know? Stay away from me! Who are you and what have you done to my brother? My name is Herman Hartmann. I died in 1873. I got trapped in your brother's body by mistake. I don't know how to get out again. I swear by all that is holy! So, your soul ... ... Herman's soul, or whatever your name is ... ... is trapped in Sylvester's body? How come you're here at all? When I was alive I was a member of a secret lodge, sworn to combat Evil. What lodge? Maybe I've read about it. - The Lodge for Combating Evil. - Clever name! The Lodge defeated one terrifying enemy after another. In the beginning our members numbered in the hundreds - - but as the powers of darkness grew stronger - - there were fewer and fewer of us left. Our secret weapon was the Lodge Book - - containing the world's most potent magic. So powerful that only one of us had the strength to use it. Her name was Linea. She was the great love of my life. We dreamt of a life of happiness, but fate had other plans. Linea was killed by a necromancer - - and our last hope for defeating the forces of darkness was gone. We had no choice but to dismantle the Lodge Book - - so it didn't fall into the wrong hands. The Book works only when it's intact - - so each member was given pages to hide where only he or she knew. I tried to ease my longing for Linea - - but nothing could drown my sorrow. I decided to put an end to it all. The pain was gone. For a long time there was nothing. Merely blissful peace. Then, all of a sudden - - it was as if my soul was torn from the Land of the Dead - - and forced back into the world. I felt something. An evil I had never sensed before. I was terrified. But then I heard the Ouija board beckon and I managed to escape. After that everything is a haze - - until my soul ended up in Sylvester's body. So you have no idea why you were called back? No, nor do I wish to know. It is no longer my lot to do battle with the forces of darkness. I merely wish to reclaim my peace in death. What about the voices we heard? Oh, that's nothing. A minor disturbance in the balance of souls. May I have another of these cola drinks? It should be quite simple to get me out of your brother's body. There must be an exorcist in the vicinity. A common mystic should be able to do it. There aren't many mystics left in this century. What? Who fights the forces of darkness? No one, really. Now everything's just TV shows and all of them are fake. My mom goes to a psychic nearby. You think he could help? It's worth a try. Do you realize how much black magic you need to call the dead back to life? It's not going to be easy, but we'll get you back somehow. It was fortunate that it was you of all people I found, Lulu. A gyrocopter! "Psychic Physical Therapist"? What's the trouble? PlayStation related thumb pains? My brother's been possessed by a ghost and we can't get it out. Have a look. These are catalogued occult experiences, world-wide. Everything's there. UFO's, ghosts, zombie pets. All very unlikely stories. And here: 4,348 video-taped conversations - - with people who are convinced they've seen a ghost. Not one story turned out to be true. There's a fortune's worth of totally useless paranormal research. Not to mention the pièce de résistance ... I've spent all my savings and 7 years of my life studying physics - - in order to build this. The SpecterTracker X-2000. It was designed to attract paranormal energies, but it mostly attracts dogs! Let's face it: Ghosts don't exist! The supernatural is a myth kept alive by pathetic losers - - clinging to the hope that life has some kind of spiritual meaning. So no. I don't do ghosts anymore. - Sorry. - We can pay you. 4,349. Herman Hartmann. Okay, Herman. So you're a 35-year-old ghost, caught in a child's body? - That is correct. - "That is correct!" Right ... We summon the Kingdom of Spirits. Free this soul from its earthly prison. O hear us, spirits. This is your humble servant Ricard requesting ... Wait. There's something I have to tell you first. I am not the only deceased soul here in Broby. Those voices calling for help yesterday are souls just like me. They've been calling to me ever since I arrived. They're being held captive on something called Monk Island. - Why didn't you tell us sooner? - I feared you would do something rash. But now Ricard can investigate the matter. Yeah, sure. Souls on Monk Island. Consider it done. Alrighty ... You are free. What? - We have to go to Monk Island. - Weren't you listening? I'm tired. I'm done fighting Evil. All I want is to return to the Land of the Dead. Then we must find out how you got here. You got any better ideas? Going sailing? What's gotten into you? I was unaware that Oliver was of noble birth. What is his lineage? I'll be in Copenhagen for the weekend, honey. - There's plenty of food in the fridge. - Just don't wreck the boat, okay? Okay, fine, Mom. Can I sleep over at Oliver's? He's just one of the neighbors. Mom, he's only thirteen! It's a shame how her hair always covers her eyes, right? We're just gonna watch some DVD's. PG, I know. I gotta go. See you. Bye. - Jeez, your family's got everything. - Mom always goes for the rich guys. Those trapped souls ... Are they dangerous? I'm more concerned about who or what's holding them captive. Those who use black magic are mostly completely ordinary people. Yeah, right. Something's wrong. The soil is completely barren. It's like this furrow has been drained of all life. Can I see? These furrows are all over the field. - What does it mean? - Someone used black magic here. Guys ... ? Run! Hurry! Faster! There must be something we can use as a weapon. Oliver, check up there. - Oliver! What's wrong? - I can't. I'm afraid of heights. Then come help me. - Herman, are you okay? - I'm getting too old for this. Lulu? - It's still there. - What?! Can't you make this thing go faster? Come on, Oliver! I'm only 13 years old. I don't wanna die! Did you see where it went? - Get it off! - Do it yourself! The trailer ... Unhook the trailer! Oliver, hurry up! Oliver! Let her go! Lulu! Let go! I've got it! Yeah! Way to go, Oliver! - You've got to be kidding ... - What? The brakes don't work! Jump! Old piece of junk ... There is something I haven't told you. I am not the only deceased soul in Broby. Those voices you heard calling, out on the pier ... Stupid toad! Help me. Let me out. Help me. Help me. Let me out. Set me free. - Help us. - Help me ... Let me out. - Oliver! Are you okay? - Am I glad to see you! We saw you fall down here. They're souls. - Wait! - Let's smash the jars and go home. Think it over. What happened to Herman's soul? It was never caught in any jar, was it? It just flew around until it bumped into Sylvester. I don't get it. If we release these souls, who's to say they won't still be trapped on earth? Lulu's right. If we destroy the jars - - we risk letting hundreds of frightened souls loose in Broby. Then how do we get the souls home to the Land of the Dead? I remember something about this. The Bridge of Souls. Something about the souls not being able to find the Bridge - - if they're bound by black magic. He must be responsible for all this. - Where ... Where am I? - Hello, my friend. Welcome. Where am I? I want to go home. I'll help you get home. But first, a simple, little question. The coat of mail your father gave you on your tenth birthday. With all the jewels ... Do you remember? Yes. It was hidden when the Swedes ravaged your village. Where did your father hide it? Beneath the fireplace in the great banquet hall. Which banquet hall? Now we know why he calls souls back from the dead. He uses them to find their hidden treasures. - Can I go home now? - But of course. Just come on down ... to your new home. Stupid bastard! I don't understand. What does he want from me? Herman Hartmann. - It's been a long time. - Oh, no ... - That was him! Come on! - Shit! C'mon, Oliver! Hurry up. - Is it coming? - Shadow creatures need light to exist. We can go down here ... This isn't happening. How can you still be alive? - We killed you! - You killed my body. I used the last of my strength to recite an invocation to keep my soul alive. Why can't souls just die already? But I was too weak to possess some random body. I needed a volunteer. Luckily I found an notary willing to surrender his body and soul - - in exchange for the magic powers I could offer him. But he must have died ages ago. Every 25 years I need a new host. But that's the lovely thing about humanity. There are always plenty of people willing to sell their soul for ... ... riches and power. Wait! They are mere children. They have nothing to do with us. Let them live! In exchange for the last pages of the Lodge Book. Hang in there! I'm on my way! - Jump! - Hurry! Come on. Get in! Come on. Now we know his human form. Everything I've done the past 20 years, my entire life's work, it's true. The supernatural exists. What? We have to stop the necromancer - - and before he grows stronger. He already seems pretty strong to me. That's nothing. What happens if he gets hold of the Lodge Book? - The Lodge Book? - He is only missing the last part. So he's already conjured up the other Lodge members. What happens if he gets it? He'll be stronger than ever before. His thirst for power will grow until the whole world is lost in darkness. Why is it always rule the whole world? Couldn't he be more original? Can you use the book to kill the necromancer? Few people are strong enough to control the magic of the Lodge Book - - I'm not one of them. Qué pasa? Es una máquina del Diablo! - What the hell just happened? - Are you okay, baby? - Por Dios! Dime, donde estamos? - Honey, I don't understand. - The ghosts are possessing people. - Did you hit your head? Lulu, Herman ... Get in here! I have to try something. What the hell are you doing? - Lulu? - Sylvester? Is it you? I had the most wicked dream. Hey, stop that. Lulu. Quit being weird. Wait here, Sylle. Ricard, come. Ricard. Pleased to meet you. What did you do? The possession in itself - - is ectoplasmic energy transferred between energy fields. A very simple process, actually. You know those model race tracks? The cars have ... No. To make a long story short. The electrical charges ... Ricard! One jolt can shock a ghost out of the person it's possessing. - 30-40 volts. Perfectly harmless. - Are you nuts? How can we stop the necromancer without Herman? A warning would have been fitting. See? He can easily get in. He just needs a bit of help getting out. The robber left the bank empty-handed. He'd asked for gold bars. Now a team of health inspectors are coming to investigate - - whether all Broby's strange occurrences are due to food poisoning. But one thing is certain: Something's very wrong in Broby. You can't just eat that without paying. But there's not an ounce of fat on this body! Right ... But you gotta pay. But that's plain robbery! Changing the price of Bavarian sausage - - from 3 pence to 23 and a half shillings. That's the lowest form of treachery. It's immoral. Do you want it, or what? Sorry. My mind was somewhere else. 23.50? Quick! Inside! You could get killed out here. I brought all my books on fighting the forces of darkness. Hi ... find anything? Herman, stay where you are. No, Oliver, not there. You're right in the line of fire. A little further away. That's it. It's supposed to draw all supernatural energies within a mile's radius. It'll give us an advantage against the necromancer's helpers. Let me know if you feel anything. Guess not. I think I've found something. The Council of the Dead. It can help undo extreme unbalance in the spirit world. Only the dead can contact them. Council of the Dead, remember? Uhh ... Right. Of course! Stop that! Get out of here! See you at the playground at nine! The oddest people came to the hospital today. A girl was asking for leeches for her boils. Am I supposed to just sit here, babbling on? It'd be nice if one of you would say something. - We're not in the mood for small talk. - Then what are you in the mood for? I've no idea what's going on. It's like I don't know you anymore. - Is it boys, or what? - No. It's got nothing to do with boys. I alienated all those dear to me when I lost Linea. - Don't make the same mistake. - Stay out of it, Herman. Herman! Come on! Herman! I don't care what your classmates do. No more watching horror movies! You get nightmares and start believing in ghost and monsters. It's summer. Go play in the pool! Man, he is so ... - Will this do for that dead council? - It looks fine. I've always dreamt of seeing a real ghost. And with this, my dream can come true. It's not so advanced - - but if the Council comes, they should show up on this screen. We ran into the scarecrow. That must mean the necromancer is around. Hi. Can I help you? It didn't work. You must have read it wrong, Herman. There aren't any ghosts. - Shit. They don't speak Danish. - The dead all speak the same language. A necromancer conjured the dead for his selfish goals. We have to stop the necromancer. We don't know. We've only seen a cave. He asks if we saw any magical objects. - There were tons of things. - What kind of object? A goat's head? A gold ring engraved with a triple six? A cat cut in half? A pentagram on the floor? He was standing on one that was painted on the ground! If we paint this sign in red in the middle of the pentagram - - the necromancer's powers will disappear. We can't take Sylvester back to the island. We have to shock Herman out and find a new body for him. Someone who can handle the necromancer. Any suggestions? I have one. Are you sure about using your step-father? It's okay. He's perfect for Herman. He's an exercise freak. Stop! That's my mother's car! - She must've run out of gas. - Mom would never run out of gas. I have to check it out. Send Sylvester home as soon as Herman has possessed Alexander. See you in half an hour down by the boats. Be careful. Mom?! Hi, you've called Beate. Please leave a message. Oliver? Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all evening. - Where's Mom? - She's in Copenhagen till tomorrow. Didn't you bring your friends along? - No, they uh ... had to go home. - Oliver, what's going on here? It didn't work! Oliver, get out of there! One wrong move and your friends are dead. - What's going on? - Don't you see? Every 25 years the necromancer must find a new volunteer host. - So we meet again. - He's possessed my step-dad. - Jolt him. - It's no use. He made a pact with the necromancer. They've always been one and the same person. You've always been so afraid, Oliver. Ever since you were small. First it was monsters in the closet. Then it was the man in the shadows ... The footsteps in the attic. The figure outside your window. Your mother thought you were hallucinating. Herman ... ? Shall we? What am I thinking? I'm not a very good host. Allow me to make you more comfortable. - Hello? - Hello, Lulu. Your friends are dead. I have your mother and brother. If you want to see them alive again, then stay out of my affairs. Get out of here, Oliver! Shadow creatures. They need light to exist. No, Oliver. I've got it under control. Oliver, what are you doing? Ricard! They can't live in the dark! Hey! I thought you were dead! - What happened? - Alexander is the new host body. This is the last time my mom gets to choose my step-dad. We have to get to your boat! - We can't sail to the island. - We've got to. That's just what he wants. It's a trap. Besides, he's too powerful. What else can we do? Call the police? "Hi. A necromancer's holding my family prisoner in a cave." I have an idea. Wasn't Herman's soul drawn to the Ouija board - - when he was called back to life? Herman? Linea? - Herman, is it you? - Linea! Where are you? Take it easy, Herman. She's right here. What's happening to me? Listen to me, Linea. Your soul is trapped in a glass jar. In a few minutes that jar is going to end up far from here - - at the bottom of the sea, where only the fish will hear your screams. And you'll never rest, Linea. You'll just lie there, alone, surrounded by darkness. For all eternity. - For God's sake, don't do it. - The choice is yours, Herman. Condemn Linea's soul to eternal suffering or ... ... tell me where the last pages of the Lodge Book can be found. All right. Wait. The Royal Library. The text is archived as an epic poem by H. Mannhart. I've coded the Ouija board's magical symbols into the SpecterTracker. I just hope I can maximize its suction capacity. The entire planet's fate is in the hands of an overgrown dog whistle! "If restless souls exist in this place - "- may this calling lend you a voice." Hear me, spirits of Broby: We need a pilot to fly an airplane! I still don't get it. How can a soul fly an airplane? - The ghost has to possess one of us. - One of us? What do you mean? I'll work the SpecterTracker and Lulu has to go. It has to be you. What? No way! - Guten abend. Ich bin pilot. - I'm afraid of heights! Can you possess one of us and fly us to Monk Island? - No problem. Who shall it be? - Ricard! Oliver, we have to make this flight. Would you prefer to fly the plane as yourself - - or wake up when it's all over? Na und, wirt was? - Take him. - Bis gleich. Attacke! Ich bin Dieter. Let us fliege. We shall bombe die English, ja? If you're thinking of World War II, it's over. Germany lost. Gut! Hitler vas ein jerkoff anyways! Gute kleine maschine, but vere are ze bombs? Great. A crazy Nazi pilot. Keine bombs, I understand. Kamikaze! You sure you know what to do? Pull the string before I hit the ground. Here's the red paint for the pentagram. Let me know when it's time. We are über der insel! The SpecterTracker should give you time enough to paint on the pentagram. - Do you remember the sign? - I think so! Take care. Sylvester? - Mom! - Lulu! - Where are we? What's happening? - Hold on, Mom. - Herman, are you okay? - Who's Herman? - I'm having the worst nightmare. - Sylvester! How cozy. The whole family's here. - Where's Herman? - He's got his own little jar. But that's the least of your worries right now. Mom, get Sylvester out of here. Ricard ... ! Ricard! Now! Come on ... ! - What's happening? - Must go to the machine! The tone ist wunderschön! Hang in there, you hear? Stay put. It works. - Tell me what's going on. - In a minute, Mom. I've got to save the world first. It works. Oh no! Lulu! Come in, Lulu! - Lulu ... ? - Not right now, Sylvester. Doesn't it look like this? - You have to get out of Oliver! - Was? Nein! - I'm flying! - Oliver! Oliver ... listen to me. - Ricard?! - Maybe you drew it wrong. - What's supposed to happen? - Okay, let's get out of here. Sylle, do you think you can fix this? Oliver. The pentagram isn't in the cave. That one's just a diversion! - Then where is it? - Look out the window. - The entire field is the pentagram! - We have to warn Lulu. The walkie-talkie's not working. She's painting on the wrong pentagram. - You have to jump, Oliver. - No. No ... - If we don't do anything, they'll die. - Can't you do it? There's only one parachute left. Do you feel like landing a plane? We're back in the barn. Sylle ... What's he doing? Give me back my former powers! Get going! I can't. You have to push me! Say hello down there from me. And for God's sake, remember to pull the string! Listen to this. Let me down ... - Mummy. - Oliver! - Lulu! - Stay there. - What are you doing? - The whole field's a pentagram. The center is that way. Okay, you run in the opposite direction. Maybe he'll follow you. Great. I'm beginning to understand why Herman chose you as his helper. Leave her alone! If only you knew how long I've been wanting to do this. It's a shame, Oliver. You could have been my new host body - - if only you weren't so unbearably weak and gutless. - Goodbye, Oliver. - Wait! What are you going to tell my mom? Have you thought about that? I'll think of something. What have you done? Beate, are you unharmed? - Where's Lulu? - Over there. The necromancer has the Lodge Book. If he has read it - - it's made him immune to the sign and all of this will have been in vain. Lulu ... As you wish. Herman, you have to be powerful to use the Lodge Book's magic. I thought you said that only a select few people - - could endure the magic of the book. And I should have known that you were one of them. Oliver tried to explain, but I'm not sure I understand. Hello, Lulu? Ricard. Are you okay? Yes, our German friend is helping out. Hope I can land this thing. - The necromancer is dead. - Yes, I can see that. - What do you mean? - You're in for a treat. Something wonderful is happening. The Bridge of Souls. As long as Evil exists, the Lodge will be needed. I can't imagine anyone more deserving than you to restore it. I'll miss you. Lulu. - Hi, Sylle. - What's going on? - Herman. - Linea. - Hello. - Hi. - I'm Ricard. - Beate. Is that the Lodge Book you've got there? We're the new Lodge. "The Lodge for Combating Evil." That's us!
