Great! Go on and do it again! Are you tired already? You're going in! Hurry! Just wait a moment. Indonesia! We can only hope that Bayu will be able to motivate his teammates to turn the score around, despite the current score of one to two. At the very least to equalize the scores and end our current series of defeats. Also to give a breath of fresh air to the national football scene these days. Goal! Don't be too upset. It was just a friendly match. But the ASEAN tournament in Bangkok is close, sir. That's true, but we have to remain optimistic and do a massive evaluation. I agree. All of you need to stay focused because you're the hope of our nation. I also want to remind you of the dinner schedule with some party officials. Starting this Monday from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. with some officials from a party based in South Jakarta. There are too many activities outside of our training. We should cancel them! The boys don't need to meet businessmen, party officials, and all that. What they currently need is concentration. On Tuesday, we'll have dinner with our sponsors from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., also in South Jakarta. But they're our donors! Their donation is important for us. We can't operate without the fund! -And on Wednesday-- -I think that's enough. That's enough for now. Thank you. Come on. Let's go home. -Just take a shower at home. -All right. Come on. We're heading off. This is important for all of us! -Enough. I know all that. -Sponsors are important! Don't disturb the kids with your political affairs. -What? -That's enough! I really want to write Mr. Ben's name on my back. Bayu, we're going to be the host. Come here! Let me see that. This is our chance. We've never won in the last 20 years. Look! That's awesome, captain! Heri called me. He told me that he went to Bandung with his dad. I need to discuss today's match with him. Because you can't discuss it with me? I feel bad for Heri. What should I talk to him about? I'm sure he'll come by this afternoon. I'll make you some iced tea. Grandpa's favorite stuff. First, you should change your clothes. -Hi. -Hey. -Come inside. -Let's. You keep joking around. Please be serious. I'm serious. May I borrow a crowbar? What for? To dig a well. I'm thirsty. Okay, wait a minute. Where are the drinks? Why is it taking so long? The well is not done yet. It's hard to get some water. Really? Who's that, mom? A failed comedian? My business partner. He asked me to join the rice business. I thought that he's forming a comedian group. What's with all the laughter? Is it necessary to be serious when talking about business? Yes, Heri? Okay. I'll wait for you tomorrow. You have to return again. So we can go on vacation together again. Bye, dad. You know, they only traveled around Bandung for four days. Apparently, it's not enough. That tackle really wasn't necessary. Without it, they wouldn't have been able to score that goal. -There was still time for an equalizer. -Why don't you tell that to the others? So they'll play better and their captain won't have to do all the work. You are their captain, Bayu. You should be a role model for them. That was their last international friendlies. -The tournament is next month. -I know that, Heri. -But I didn't see it yesterday. -Perhaps you're mistaken. The two of you were apart for so long, and now you're bickering already. You should be chatting, not arguing. I'm sure that Mr. Harrido knows what he's doing. Hey! Watch your speed! Come on! Sorry to bother you, sir. But we need to talk. It's important. Let's go, sir. Bayu! Sorry. I panicked yesterday. I understand. Hey, Bayu. You just arrived? Where's your next match? I'm off. -Are you Bayu? I'm Rasti. -Bayu. Here's my name card. I'm a supporter of the national team. Bye! You're awesome. I should make a fan club for you soon. A fan club? Our national team has never won. Don't be so negative. You got this from losing. Imagine if you had won. The future? You mean a bleak future? THE FUTURE OF INDONESIAN FOOTBALL Do you have a name card? Excuse me, this is my table. A new rule from our homeroom teacher. Good morning, everyone. Bayu. Bayu! You're sitting with me from now on. You've been absent too often. -Is that a new student? -From Surabaya. Thanks. As the school counselor, I'm quite worried because Bayu's mid-term report card shows low scores on some of the subjects. I understand his situation. Our school also supports him. But he also needs to study hard. He needs to get better results by working on some final year projects. Listen to me, Bayu. Don't make me ask you to choose between school and football. Do you understand? I have to leave for a meeting. Don't forget this. Oh no, it's not approved yet. What's lacking with my photos? -How many more friends did you get? -I didn't accept all of them. Remind me to create your fan page. Please get me the dish towel in the drawer. You still keep this? It was my grandpa's. I really want Indonesia to win. Until the day he died, grandpa never saw me win a match. Wow, Bayu! This girl is very pretty! I'll add her. Okay? Listen up, everyone. For this subject, there will be no final test. However, there'll be a project, which score will be the same as a final test. Bayu, you know Doni, right? He has to repeat another year because he flunked Jakarta Life Education. And, it is a group project. We were grouped together by name, not by our own choice. So everyone has to participate, don't just be a follower. Be an active group member. I'll make sure of that. Okay. Now, we'll choose the group leader. I agree with you. Any volunteer? What about you, Anya? You're right. You should be the leader. Yes, you should. Hold on. What's up with you? Do you want to volunteer? No. I mean, I want to suggest a place for research-- Hold on, Bayu. We need to distribute the tasks first to ensure responsibility. Suit yourself. You're the leader. I'm curious. Anya? The new student with the pretty eyes? All the boys say that she's pretty. Not that. I need to get good scores for Jakarta Life Education. But my group also need to understand that I have a tournament coming up. If you want to make a model, you better go to my neighborhood. -It's a model. -Whatever. It has to be dirty and full of trash, correct? In my neighborhood, the problem of trash is never-ending. They're not collected every day, so they pile up. Stop messing around. This is an important project. My God, Bayu. Why would I lie about trash? It's the truth. The only trash that needs to be maimed are scumbags. If you don't want to do it, then leave it to me. As long as Anya is there, trash is not a problem. Can I have your tofu? You're so stingy! Just give it to him! Sir, may I have some water? Sorry, but that's mine. Nowadays, taxi bike riders are so annoying. More, please. Thirsty, sir? Buy first! Perhaps the new coach is a foreigner. Cool! I can ask my mom to enroll me in an English course. What about Mr. Yudi? That's impossible. Dad doesn't like to be blamed. Kids, gather around! I need to announce something. As a representative of the organization, I'd like to introduce you to your new coach, Mr. Wisnu Bramastya. Just call me Mr. Wisnu. I know I'm not in a good position because I arrived right before a tournament. But for the Garuda Team, all positions should be good! Because we're destined to fly high. Do you know why I accepted this offer? Because I know that I'll be dealing with a team who works three times harder than the other teams. -Am I right? -Yes! I just ask one thing of you. You must trust me completely. -Is that understood? -Understood! Enough of that. Let's get to the point. This is our main problem. I'll also be adding a new member from the final selection. Any question? Okay. We'll start training tomorrow. Sorry, sir. But tomorrow's a holiday. We usually don't have training. Not anymore. I'll see you tomorrow morning. This is your new physical training facility. The formula is simple. -Okay! -If you train halfheartedly, you'll also play halfheartedly. Don't stop! Keep going! Football requires hard work! Come on! Keep the spirit up! Keep going! Don't stop! Wow! You look like someone who just carried the PON flame. That's better, sir. I'm sure Mr. Wisnu just needs to know the limit of your stamina. -That's cool. -What do you mean cool? Most of the kids gave up. You're wrong. He's a good coach. Take a look. STRICT AND QUICK-WITTED, THAT'S WISNU BARMASTYA It's useless to be good when you're out of breath. How can we win? I don't get you lately. Perhaps because I'm the one who's on the field. Calm down! Stop biting each other's head off over football. It's better if you bite into some meatballs. Calm down! Come, help me wash the car. You can play with some water. It's refreshing. Come on! The point is comprehensive planning. Now, go sit with your group. -Where should we sit? -At my table. Okay, first we have to discuss this. When will we do the survey? Collect the model components? And build it? Some of the dates clashes with my matches-- Bayu! Be serious. We're already quite behind. Some of the other groups have already done the survey. This is important. I have a duty to the country. This is an ASEAN tournament. Anya, what's the matter? Nothing, sir. Okay, give me a list of the clashing dates. And you have to finish your tasks. No excuses. Get up! Come on! Come on! Don't give up! We'll run out of members. By now, we've already lost five members. Come on, keep it up! This is our new friend, Yusuf Matutu from Makassar. In football, we have to go through a process to create goals. And today, we'll learn to appreciate that process. Because one of our weaknesses is taking things too lightly when we're successful. There are only 20 of us left, sir. And that includes the new kid, Yusuf. There are not enough players. What if someone gets injured? Let me take care of that. Your job is to keep the team's spirit up. Yusuf, what about your education? I've moved to a school here. Mr. Wisnu took care of everything. Where do you live here? At my uncle's house, but he already moved to Bogor. So now, I'm unsure about where to live. But they told me that the manager would help me find a place. Yusuf, why don't you stay at my house? I have plenty of empty rooms. We can go to practice together. Do you want to? Sure. What are you ordering, Yusuf? What are you having? The grilled chicken. Mr. Wisnu is too harsh. He's different from Mr. Harri. And he's left our team with barely any members left. Have you tried talking to him? Yes, but he only told me to keep the team's spirit up. That's understandable, you're the captain. You were chosen because of your ability. I also believe that you'll be able to do it. But you should also pay attention to your grades. Watch it! Does it hurt here? This is Mr. Dulloh, the one who suggested the location for our project. Thank him. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you, sir. You're welcome. The problem of flooding is never-ending here. Not to mention the issue of trash. Just look at that. Piling up in the sewer. Too bad Heri can't come with us. So the saying is true, "Awful things become better with someone sweet." It's never the same person who collects and deals with the trash, is it? And it's not done on a daily basis, right? How did you know? A lack of workers. It's a classic problem. You should treat each opponent equally. Including our first opponent, Philippines, a team that people don't take seriously. We don't stumble on big rocks but on pebbles. We won't be taking in any more new members. For me, this is the best team that currently exists. So, nobody will get dropped anymore? -Yes -Hooray! -Yes! -Come on! I should be the one wearing this shirt. I've watched all of Benyamin Sueb's movies. You weren't even born yet. I collect his movies, sir. Have you watched Drakula Mantu? Of course. They said that it was the first ever comedy horror movie in the world. Intan Berduri? For that movie, Mr. Ben received a Citra Award, right? I've also watched Spion 025, sir. -Around ten times or more. -Wow. -What's your favorite song? -"Kompor Meleduk"! That's too common, sir! My favorite song is "Keluarga Gila," sir! Mine is "Siti Marsitol." But your taste is not bad. -I'll be going, then. -Okay, sir. Philippines is not a big threat. This is our chance to attack. Rama and Yusuf at the front, you're the shadow striker. What! Shadow? Are we humans or ghosts? Playing in the shadow? Trust me. It corresponds with Mr. Wisnu's tactics. He's all you talk about. It's useless. He didn't even take note. It'll only confuse you. The tickets. All the way to the finals. That's right. Be optimistic. Bayu! Two tickets, please. The Surabaya branch will open up soon. Yes. For the one in Semarang, you still need to survey around first. Yes. Please help me out for that? Sure, we'll set it up together. -Really? -Yes. Hi, Bayu. Mr. Rudi is just about to leave. Bayu, tomorrow's match is against the Philippines, right? Don't use your emotion during the game. -Take care. -Sure, I'll be going. -Bye. -See you. He understands football? At least better than me. -Who will go with you to tomorrow's match? -Mr. Rudi. We also need to talk about work. -Indonesia! Indonesia! -Indonesia! Indonesia! -Indonesia! Indonesia! -Indonesia! Indonesia! Okay, tonight you'll be watching a match between Indonesia and Philippines. The Indonesian team has to win this afternoon's match. Bayu, Yusuf, Rama, take the front line. -Denni, you're the defender. -Yes, sir. Effendi, you're a substitute. Okay, everyone. Remember your training. Be focused and disciplined, that's all you need. Focused and disciplined. Bayu, lead a prayer. Let's begin the prayer. Let's end the prayer. Keep the spirit up! One, two, three! -Indonesia! Hey! -Indonesia! Hey! We'll soon move to the field. The whistle has been blown! Indonesia goes on full attack! -Yes. -We'll just have to watch and see. That's too bad! On paper, the quality of our team is far more superior than their team. That's right. -Kevin! Go back, Kevin! -It seems that the Philippines players don't play nicely, with rough tackles. That tackle was too rough. I hope that the injury is not too bad. We should change players, sir. -Get the substitute ready. -Yes, sir. Bayu! Cover the left wing. Don't rush when you're dribbling the ball. Think first. Watch their right wing. Bayu, that's your duty. Viewers, you're currently watching a match between the national teams of Indonesia and Philippines. -And we're entering the second half. -That's right. The Philippines team is still playing on the defense and also very rough. They need to do that to hold against attacks from the Indonesian team. -Our players are provoked. -Yes. Just look at Bayu. He's starting to look angry. -He's provoked. -This is dangerous. If this gets out of control, it might get us into trouble. It looks like Yusuf is also starting to push. Yes. What a shame. It's not something that we hoped for. Damn it! We're done! Why throw a tantrum? This is your fault. You couldn't even catch the ball. Why are you blaming me? What? -Come here! -Come here! This is what happens when Effendi isn't playing. It has nothing to do with that. This requires a team's effort, not just one person. You've clearly made a blunder, but still haughty. Talking back at me! I was wrong. I didn't prepare them enough to play against rough opponents. I focused too much on stamina. But please, give me some breathing space. Leave me be. Leave you be? I'm an official. -I'm the one who pays you. -No, it's the people. Wisnu. This team is your only responsibility. But I'm responsible for the whole organization and also your performance. The match against Vietnam will determine your fate. Even if it ends in a draw, we'll have a massive evaluation. Sir, I always promise you hard work. I'm ready to get fired, but please give me complete freedom. Fine, that's fair enough. Okay, I guess we have a deal. Their strength is their offense. The more pressure the better. Come on! That's how they won last year. But that doesn't mean that they're unbeatable. We have speed. But we have to follow the scheme diligently. And the key is our rhythm. Go back there. Good, Effendi. -Are you in pain? -No, I'm just worried of an injury. Starting from today, Yusuf will be staying at my house. We're going to shop for some socks. Do you want to come with us? I can't. -You're just pretending to be busy. -It's true. I'm off. -May I ask you something? -Sure. How's the communal work system for trash handling in this area? People just throw trash anywhere at all. Is there a park nearby? -No. -Where do the kids play? -Here, in the front yard. -What are some changes that you want? I'm not sure. Perhaps a park? MR. DULLOH'S VILLAGE PARK CLINIC Being late means a lack of respect for time. And football is all about the ability to use time and chance effectively. Remember that. Sorry, the macaroni is a bit mushy. -You actually made this? -Sure. -Thanks. -Try it. -Be careful. It's still hot. -It looks tasty. Bayu, do you still have an extra ticket for the finals? Who is it for? You usually watch it by yourself. It's for me. Just in case they're sold out. It's always hard to get a ticket. Especially for the finals. Just a second. Hello? Yes. How was it? Our next opponent is Vietnam, right? I used to live in Vietnam. My place was near the practice field of their junior team. Their strikers are very sharp. They usually win by leading more than one goal. It's easy to win against them. Just score more goals. Rudi, I managed to schedule a presentation with Mr. Willy. Congratulations! I'm so happy. -Please help me with the presentation. -Sure. So cool! Come on! Wow! -Your taste is so outdated. -Outdated can be cool too, Bayu. Let's do a practice match. Condition your mind to play against Vietnam tomorrow. Okay, good! On the left wing. Yusuf should be on the left wing. He'll be even more deadly. He's the next Boaz Solossa. You saw it yourself. He's a sharper striker. According to my notes and my conversation with him, Yusuf prefers to be a left winger. So that he can maximize his spin and dribble. If you put him on the left wing, the opponent won't predict it. That's just the facts. The fact is, you don't know him. He's been staying with you for two days, and you act like you know him. It's better to drink cendol, than spew vitriol. Here. It's refreshing. And will calm your throat. -Hey. Let's go, Yusuf. -Okay. God, please give us the spirit and strength to be the pride of our country and nation today. Amen. -Amen. -Amen. -Let's go! -Keep the spirit up! Keep the team's spirit up and control your emotion. Yes, that's accurate. We have to win. It's a must if we want to stay in this tournament. As you can see. Even early in the game, the Vietnamese players are already dominating the game and they play really fast. While Indonesia seems to have trouble breaking through Vietnam's defense. They're good at both defense and offense. Exactly. And one of their strikers -looks very dominant in this game. -Move forward! That's right and it's causing trouble for the Indonesian team. Retreat! That's one to zero. -A blow for our young Garudas. -Yes. Vietnam clearly dominates the game, as you can see. Let's see if Bayu will be able to lower the current score gap? -He did it! -Goal! That's a goal. Finally, a goal for Indonesia. -Yes! -Hooray! This time, it's Yusuf trying for a long range. Goal! Amazing! For now, the score is two to two. We can see that Indonesia is currently dominating the game. -He passes the ball. -Keep going! He goes straight to the penalty box and kicks the ball. Goal! -That's awesome! -Our Garuda national team and the spectators' euphoria are at an all-time high! Bayu! Congratulations, Bayu. Keep it up until the finals. -Do you have Yusuf's number? -Say hi to Yusuf for me. "YUSUF" GARUDA'S NEW HOPE I'd like to remind you that you have to come to my house tomorrow. You already have the address and don't be late. Hey, let's go home. Hey, wait up. I'm coming too. Anya, I'm off. Bayu, I'm off. Anya, I'm off. Take care. Bye, Bayu. Hey, wait for me. Bayu? Bayu Purnomojati? Anya, why didn't you tell me that Bayu is here? Bayu, congratulations. The captain of the national team is here. Are you leaving now? Sorry, I can't send you home. Persebaya's game is about to start. Congratulations. Anya! Hey, Bayu. What? Yes, my father is a football fan. -So, you actually like-- -I deal with too much football at home. Do you remember the way out? I seem to have forgotten the way. Fine, I'll walk you out. So, your grandpa... Sorry. Bayu, why did you insist on a park? I just want the kids in that neighborhood to be able to play in a park. Unlike me, who had to play at a cemetery and a badminton field made of concrete. Why didn't you tell me? A park might be important, but a clinic is more important. It's because you usually talk nonsense. You should talk with a smile like that. I mean... Talk seriously. Like that. Bayu, that's not what I meant. Bayu. Tuni is getting married in Malang on the 12th. Aunt Rina will send us train tickets. As long as it's not on the seventh. That's when the finals start. We might get to the finals. Yesterday, we defeated the reigning champion. Fine. Then, we'll leave on the ninth. Let Aunt Ida leave on the seventh. So, we only need to change the tickets. Okay? That means I won't be able to watch the match against Laos. Is that okay? I have a presentation. How does it feel to win for the first time? What is Yusuf like on a day-to-day basis? -Yusuf is... -Aren't you the captain? Any comment about the way he played? Every reporter has to get out! Now! -This is not a press conference room. Out! -Hey, sir. Sir, we already got permission from the officials. They only have authority in the press conference room. Over here, it's my rules. Get out! -Take a picture! -Get out! So annoying! Stay focused! Don't let these things disturb your concentration! You're not playing to be infotainment actors. Laos is a strong opponent. -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! An imp playing with a ball? That's bad. You're so funny. I was called an imp? -That must have been embarrassing. -Absolutely. Bayu, have you caught a cold? -Yusuf, from my observation, I think that -Or, you have a toothache? your ideal position is at the left wing. You know that I have a problem with my left foot. I'm sure you can do it. Right, Bayu? It's up to him. But Beckham uses his right foot. Exactly, captain. Awesome. Cool. Your shirt collar is cool. I want to play against Yusuf. No practice match. Marcel, prepare the target post! Yes, sir. That's the captain. That means that he's the best. Sometimes we will end up in an unwanted position. When you're at that point, talent and technical skill won't be enough. Mental strength. That's the most important thing. Don't let other things disturb your concentration. The spectators, the noise, all of those eyes on you. Ignore them. Playing football also means playing against yourselves. Repeat that! He's very disciplined. He also has amazing skills. That's why the opponents were fooled by Yusuf's skill. You idolize him, right? He also has great shooting skills. We rarely see a tall Indonesian striker. But he's quite tall. Thus, he's the future of Indonesian football. It should be submitted soon! Get ready to do a presentation. -Boo! -Boo! The better the presentation, the higher the score you'll get. Anya, will your dad be watching the semifinals match? Will you come? You should come. When I play, my smile becomes even more intense. Okay. If you reach the finals, I'll take you to my special park. Their defense is very strong. Only broken once in this tournament. Their attacks are on point. They have scored ten goals. To anticipate their 4-3-3 formation, I'll add one more midfielder on the field and I'll revise the front line. What do you mean? One of you will be a substitute player. I have an idea, sir. I'm ready to be one of the double strikers with Rama. We will be better than Yusuf. I can also defend. Yusuf is a pure striker. I'll think about it. -There must be a manual to arrange this. -Let's see. -The picture is good. -And the position. What's this? Take a look at it. -See? -Bayu. Bayu. Come here. I want to talk to you. You know that I'll be opening a branch in Semarang. You didn't tell me. Perhaps you told Mr. Rudi. Well, there's a problem. The land that I bought for the office is a disputed land. I have to go there because the case is taken to court. Tomorrow. During the semifinal match. I'll watch it on TV. Okay? Viewers, you're currently watching the semifinal match of the ASEAN Cup between the Garuda national team of Indonesia and the Malaysian national team. Remember! Mental strength. Mental strength, focus, and discipline. Players and the coaching team, peace be with all of us. I won't take any more of your time but I'm here to remind you that this tournament is important for all of us. Don't be a disappointment. We've fulfilled all your needs. Facility, funds. We've made great sacrifices. So, I'm asking you to repay them with a win. We have to win. You have to win! Okay? Mr. Iwan, the Malaysian team is playing very well in the first few minutes. Exactly, and they are overwhelming our team. I wonder what's coach Wisnu's strategy putting Yusuf out in the first half. -How come your hair is so stiff? -I sprayed it with hairspray. I hope that this is a good strategy to defeat the Malaysian team. Malaysia's captain, Yapsun Seng, -is aggressive. -Correct. -Come on! -Keep going! Bayu often covers the midfield even though he's a striker. I'm really curious with the strategy of making Yusuf a substitute. You're currently watching the match between the Indonesian team and the Malaysian team. And now we're entering the second half. Even though the sky is gray, the game is still going on. -Forward! -Bayu makes a blunder. Danger! Yapsun Seng is closing in and shooting to our goal. One to zero. That's right. Bayu looks angry. And coach Wisnu also looks upset. Yusuf is currently stretching. The spectators' applause shows their appreciation of Yusuf's entrance. -The Malaysian coach is trying to adapt -He's worried. with coach Wisnu's strategy. Let's watch as Yusuf makes his move. Shoot! -And he did it! -Goal! Indonesia equalizes the score to one to one. Apparently, the Malaysian coach has instructed a new strategy to stop Yusuf's moves. Yes. The Malaysian coach is panicking now. Two of the Indonesian players need to be replaced. Because the tempo of the game is getting faster and rougher. Too bad Bayu is busy playing by himself -and not following the tempo of the game. -That's a mistake. This is a blunder from Bayu. -Mr. Wisnu looks very upset with-- -He's starting to get angry. Too bad he was tackled. We'll see if the referee will give a penalty kick for Indonesia. However, the referee is not giving a penalty kick -for the Indonesian team. -What the hell? Mr. Wisnu enters the field and pushes the referee. And the referee gives him a red card. Shut up! The semifinal match needs to be resolved with a penalty shoot-out. And Bayu, our captain will determine the first shot. -Goal! -Hooray! -Yusuf! -Yusuf! -Goal! -Goal! -Yes! -Yes! Yes! -Yes! -Yes! No! Yes! Come on. Come on! -Goal! -Goal! Yes! -Yes! -Yes! You're so skilled. That was awesome. -Hooray! -The finals! I want to apologize and thank you for your determination. Congratulations, you're going to the finals. -Yes! -Hooray! For the finals, Rama will be the captain. Indonesia to the finals! Bayu! Bayu! You must have had a say in the decision to make Yusuf a substitute. We're lucky to have reached the finals. I'm tired, Heri. It no longer matters, right? It matters to me. You no longer show sportsmanship. I don't show sportsmanship? I know that you're envious of Yusuf. You're the captain. You should know better-- I'm no longer the captain. Are you happy now? It's okay. You still have Yusuf. For you, the most important thing is football. You want the best. The person who can fulfill your dream on the field. Not your friend. You should give this to the person that you consider a friend. It seems that we have different views on being a friend. Bayu? Bayu? Leave me alone. Now pass it. -Come on! -Practice your ball control again. Anyone knows where Bayu is? -No, sir. -No, sir. -Keep practicing! -Come on! Why are you here? Let's go to the park right now. My father taught me many things here. From climbing the monkey bars to the trees. Climb it. It's for toddlers. Just do it. Hurry. Don't underestimate it. -One, two, three. -One, two, three. Ice cream! Which one do you want? I also want that one. What? What's the matter? Bayu. I actually want you to do the presentation. Honestly, as the leader, I have to report on the members' participation. And you're lagging behind the others. I understand your situation. With the tournament. So, I want to be fair by letting you do the presentation. I don't want to lie in my report. Why don't you do it? It's better that way. You shouldn't rely on me. Why? Is it too difficult for the captain of the national team? It's just a project presentation. Former captain. I've failed. I won't be playing in the finals. I'll be in Malang. You're leaving your team? It seems that they don't need me. You know, during my time as the captain, we always had difficulties. We never won. That means you're not the man that I thought you were. I thought that you always cared about your friends. Your team and other people. But apparently, you only care about your position as a captain. Aunt Ida called. She told me that you changed the tickets, so we would leave on the day of the finals. She wanted to make sure that it wasn't a mistake. If it wasn't a mistake, it doesn't seem like the Bayu that I know. You and your friends worked so hard to reach the finals. You're going to give up just like that? It's up to you. About my development in the national team, Heri would know better. -I just had to focus on playing. -How long have you known him? Know him? Without him, I wouldn't be here. Bayu? Bayu sees the game like it's a chess match. Cool. Bayu's assists were great. That's why I could score the goal. Right, Heri? Right. I told Yusuf to stay close to Bayu if he wanted to win. We have done a survey in a neighborhood. The neighborhood said that it often gets flooded. Especially in Block A. Do the people agree with the green initiative? The people completely agree. They even support our program. We already did... Our model looks bad, right? Communal work and the green initiative. When will it begin? As soon as possible. -Sorry. -What about a landfill site? -Yesterday, I forgot to tell you. -A landfill site will be made... Thank you for bringing me to the park. It is special. You used to say that our group wasn't formed by choice. But I think that it was some good luck that placed us in the same group. Good. Next group, Anya and her friends. Go on. What's going on? This is our model. This is the modified version of Mr. Dulloh's neighborhood. With houses that we've designed to ensure the people's safety from rain, storm, and other weather conditions. We've also included a clinic to help sick people in the area. We know some parks... Great! Once again, thank you. He keeps asking about you. Who's this ticket for? For my best friend. If he's willing to forgive me. So, truce? We're bad at staying mad. Bayu! Don't forget to move the ball between your two feet. Because if you do that with your hands, it will be a handball. You're so funny. Thanks, mom. Today is the day of the finals. You all need to be more fired up than in the previous games. -Are you all ready? -Yes! Here are the players for the first half. -Beni, ready? -Ready, sir! -Yusuf, ready? -Ready! -Damba, ready? -Ready! -Thomas, ready? -Ready! -Rama? -Ready! I want to apologize for missing our last practice. I know that I was wrong, sir. I might not be the captain anymore, but it doesn't matter. This is what matters. I'll work three times harder than in the previous games, sir. Bayu, I won't be standing by the field today. But there will come a time when you and your friends will need to make a decision. -Are you ready? -Ready! Now, go do some stretching by the field. You'll enter in the second half. I have faith in you, Bayu. But you also have to trust me. I made this decision due to the seriousness of the situation. Now, join the others. Sorry, Yusuf. I shouldn't have done that. Why are you apologizing? Is there a problem between us? Seriously, if there's any problem, we should talk about it first. -Was it something I did? -No, I was just kidding. Relax. I don't get the jokes that the people of Jakarta make sometimes. Everybody, gather around! -Let's go! -Let's go! Yes! -Indonesia! Hey! -Indonesia! Hey! What? Biang Kerok! -Are you sure? -Yes, sir. It seems that you need Mr. Ben's smile more than I do. Viewers, you're currently watching the U15 ASEAN Cup finals between the Indonesian national team and the Thailand national team. -Indonesia! Indonesia! -Indonesia! Indonesia! -This is the most anticipated event. -Yes. The finals between Indonesia and Thailand. Hopefully, we'll win this game. I can't predict much because Thailand's strengths are different to our team. Also, Coach Wisnu is suspended and can't stand by the field. All right. They're about to do the kick-off . Indonesia is still using the 4-4-2 formation. With the duo Yusuf and Rama at the front line. Bayu is sitting on the bench. What's going on here? I hope that it's just a strategy to give some shock therapy to the Thailand national team. Thailand starts with their best lineup. There's Tuantong, one of their best players. Yes. Tuantong is currently the top scorer in this tournament. Yusuf isn't using his left foot. Why is that? He has some problems with his feet. It seems that Thailand's goalkeeper, Pastatorn, and their defender, Quenta, are playing very well. It looks like the Thai players are dominating the ball, overwhelming the Indonesia team. Come on! In the 30th minute, Thailand shows their domination through their striker. Tuantong is taking over the ball that Beni lost. -Hold on, sir. -But they need guidance. The kids know what they're doing. We, the adults, need to trust them. -It won't take long. -We should give them some breathing room, -so that they can focus on playing. -Listen to me! -Follow me to the seats. -They-- -Let's watch it together from there. -They need some motivation! Okay, everyone. We have to rise in the second half. Friends! There's only one thing that can stop us today, the final whistle by the referee! Before that happens, we haven't lost yet! -We can do it! -We can do it! -Keep the spirit up! -Let's pray! -Let us all gather to pray! -Pray! Let's end the prayer. -Everyone! -Everyone! -Indonesia! Hey! -Indonesia! Hey! -Keep your spirit up! -Keep your spirit up! Now, we'll watch the second half of the final match between Indonesia and Thailand. Let's hope that we'll be able to turn the situation around. Come on! Bayu replaces Arif on the left wing. In the first few minutes, Thailand seems overwhelmed with the entrance of Bayu in the second half. Keep your spirit up! Bayu has managed to set the game, allowing our players to pass the ball around smoothly. -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! Goal! One to one! It's a draw. Garuda in my heart Garuda is my pride I believe that today With the song "Garuda di Dadaku," I hope our team's spirit will be lifted up. The color red dominates the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. It looks so cheerful. We can see that they're starting to play more aggressively. -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Look, Yusuf has a chance -Yes. from the left wing and he tries to shoot. But alas! He failed. Even though Thailand's goalkeeper wouldn't have been able to catch it. Tuantong runs straight to the penalty area! It's getting hard to guard him. One of the Thai players is having a cramp. -Yes, Bayu? -Sir. We need a midfielder to guard Tuantong. -We've run out of midfielders. -Put Effendi in. -But he's a striker. -Just trust me, sir. He's the most fit out of all of us. -I'll take full responsibility for this. -Bayu! Effendi enters the field. You have to trust me. You only have one task. Be an anchor. Seize the ball from our opponent, okay? Yusuf, let's surprise everyone. Cover the left wing. You're not Beckham, and you'll be greater than Boaz. You're going solo at the front line. Open a way for me and Yusuf. We'll use the 4-3-2-1 formation. -Okay? -Let's go. -The game is entering its 87th minute. -This is all very thrilling. We can see Yusuf making a move. That's too bad! It hits the goal post! We're now in the last few minutes. Hurry! -Goal! -Goal! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! -Indonesia! Line 1,000, scene 63, first shoot, first take! We won't be taking in any more new members. Cut. They must be large. -Sorry, I'm sorry. -Cut. -Calm down. Not yet? -Not yet! What do you think Heri's day-to-day life is like? -Yusuf! -Oh no! Why are you apologizing? Is there a problem between us? Sorry, Yusuf. I shouldn't have done that. Why are you apologizing? -What problem? -Cut. -Is there a problem between us? -Cut. Why are you apologizing? Is there a problem between us? Cut. -Why are you apologizing? -Cut. We have softened the roads for cyclists. The captain of the national team is here. Are you leaving now? Forgive me, Bayu. Sorry. We haven't distributed the tasks yet, so that the tasks are clear. To make it easier for cyclists, and also for the morning joggers. Sorry. Okay! So, we have to do extra. Work three times more... The tickets. All the way to the finals. That's right. Be optimistic. Sorry. Who's that? A failed comedian? My business partner. He asked me to join the rice business. -Cut. -Sorry. We have added some trees, so that... Sorry, I've forgotten the lines! Subtitle translation by Shelomi Angeli Karmo R.
