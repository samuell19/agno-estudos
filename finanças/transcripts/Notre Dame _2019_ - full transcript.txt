As I never signed a contract - What do you mean ? - Well no. - We'll make you one. It is not serious for lying to me. Not at all serious at all. There is too much unsaid.

Use the computers, the drawing machine, printers, restaurant vouchers, the trash, open the window... You are at home here.

Hello, Maud? - I can't, I'm sleeping. CRS: a competition facilitated to make the sector more attractive. - It's the start of a new life for Maud and a new story. There you go, and one last here. She sees Bacchus every day and every night she dreams of him. - This is the first loan of 18,360 euros. This youthful love that arises in her turned upside down life - Everything happens at the same time, she sometimes thinks. Bacchus observes her and questions her. It troubles her, but she answers. - Were you born on March 2, 1975? - Yes. - In the Vosges? - Yes. - Nurse mother, commercial father? - Exact. - Your dog, it was Kiki. - What a memory! - By the way, when we say "see you tonight" and don't come, what does it mean ? - I don't know, I don't know. - Despite the fatigue, the pregnancy continues. Maud hasn't said anything to Martial, who hasn't returned since. She connects the meetings. - Mr. Koubir - I'm not in it. Can you see me now? Maud came to our agency in 2004. I saw her direct potential. I felt it. I taught her everything. - We'll have to ease off. No, Maud, you have to rest. With great power, great responsibility. So big that the town hall sends its best structural engineers. Even if she doesn't always feel up to it, Maud stays on course. - Sorry, darling. - Mom ? - Yes. - Why do women do everything? Papa ! - How are you, sweetheart ? - Yeah. Mom, did you know? - No I did not know. - Well, you're not moving, OK? - It's okay ? - What are you doing ? - You never answer. - You argued? - As soon as I talk about you, she cracks. - Normal. Why are you talking about me? - Because you matter to me! You are the mother of my children, I miss you - Did Vincent open for you? - Yes, he is with his homework assistant. - It's not true Here. Change the water of the fish. - They are fat - The lesson is over. Sorry, Leah, it's not against you. You are the 3rd, and the year has just started! But it's not true ! And you don't have a phone. - What's wrong ? I'm fine, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. I just paid Léa to train. He doesn't even have the right to prostitutes. - Françoise - Martial, say something! - That's enough ! Enough, Enough. Your mother is right. - It makes no sense. Gnocchi and off to bed. I have to work. - Do we eat gnocchi? Can I have my pillows? - Here. Here. - And a small glass of water. Thank you. A little cushion? - You're infernal. - You love it. - 2 nights, no more. - A promise. - You take care of the children. - According to the engineers, here we are in Gruyère. - Ah. - So So we have to bring the metro exit closer. - There you go, so we bring it closer. - We'll need a second. There will be flow. It's Notre-Dame, all the same. - With Vigipirate, we can't overload. - Well no. So a second, come on. - It can work, though. - That could work. - Let's go ? - I also told you that it did not hold! - We are on the slack, the sacred slack. - Exactly, fluids, it's not okay. And the basin for the fountain? We thought... Actually, it was more planned here, but... - That's why we have to expand. - Yes. So we are expanding. Let's not be afraid of the monumental, after all, it's Notre-Dame. - We're going to be very heavy. - With two exits? - It's been two exits. - Green, like that, is trendy. - Expanding comes at a cost. - Yes, because you're expanding, you widen and at one point - If we don't try... - It can work there. With something a little airy - It's not starting to look like... - They know what they're doing. - Léonard, are you going to reinforce with steel or aluminum? - Titanium, something modern. - Everything is possible. - If it fits in the budget, we can do a third outing. - Ah ! - Health ! - Have you ever thought about me? - Of course yes. - Wait. Is that where you live, then? - Yes. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Good night. - Good night. You scared me ! - You too ! - What are you doing here ? - Sorry, I don't sleep well on the sofa. - That's not a reason. We are separated! - Exactly, I thought. Since I've been here, I can see that the children are well, they sleep well. They eat well. - What? - The children. - What, children? - I have to settle down here. For them it is better. - And Sybille? What do you do with Sybille? - I'll do her every other week. There. - Why was he in your bed? - He sleeps badly on the sofa. I am relieved to have told him. - You didn't tell him anything. - I need to talk to you. I met someone, I am very much in love with him, and I'm expecting a child from him. - Who is he? - Didier, my colleague. I said I was pregnant. - From Didier. Whatever. Why did you invent that? - If you think it's easy.. I can't put him at a distance. - You still love him ? - No I think not. - But what are you afraid of? I think I am blocking. - It's psychological. - Even psychological, it remains a blockage. - Have I seen Didier? - No I do not think so. - How is he ? - Not tall, round, with intelligent eyes. - Hum - Mr. Prefect, happy to meet you. - Likewise. - I'm Maud's sister. It's okay ? - Yes Yes. - I have a nice project to present to you. - No problem. - Concerning the Seine. --Cheers. - Radio, press, TV: they are all there. - A mouse just passed there. - Maud, don't forget: your conviction does the work, always. A choice of...? - Heart and color. - Heart and color. Good evening. I regret to tell you that Mr. President cannot be with us. - Damn maybe it will happen? - We are going through an epidemic of gastroenteritis which got the better of his condition. I take this opportunity to address a health message: wash your hands. For a Great Lady, a great competition. We have received over a thousand submissions. Our choice - A small glass of water, perhaps? - It's a choice of the heart and color. I am proud, we are all here at the town hall of Paris, to present you the future from the square of Notre-Dame. Warmly welcome - Miss Maud Crayon. You have surely seen funny glasses under your seats. The world is modernizing and the city of Paris too. We therefore offer you to discover the new square, as if you were there, in virtual reality. Have a good trip and see you later. Thank you. Applause - The story of Notre-Dame is a true epic. Religious and heritage building, it will take 182 years to be completed. A new episode opens around the rehabilitation of its square. Discover and dive into the heart of Maud Crayon's project, winner of the Paris City Hall competition. A titanium fountain erected towards the sky will make the link between darkness and the hereafter. Two translucent cells will serve the metro exits. Two huge escalators powered by solar energy will allow the transfer of millions of users in the capital. The water will be redistributed continuously and pass through cleaning filters ensuring perfect hygiene conduits and lower maintenance costs. The pools will be surrounded by sound sensors that will make the water from the fountains gush to the sound of cathedral bells. Madam Mayor, the diocese of Paris is demanding an apology. What do you answer? Excuses ? I apologize. Maud Crayon's project has been called the obscenity of the century. We can speak of scandal! A work has already caused controversy. Beaubourg, The Louvre pyramid Time takes time. - Pardon. - What about the phallic aspect of this project? - An out of proportion penis is not a penis anymore, it's art. This project is a failure for the architecture, culture and France. Her project has been selected, so why come to this? It's pornography at the doors of our churches. Has the mayor thought about it? The town hall defends you on Internet. Too bad she's so stupid. Maud Crayon's problem concerns all women. It's machismo. Our world is ruled by bureaucrats wearing ties who when they are not convicted of sexual abuse, crush women Come. Come on, come on. OK. Come on, come on, I'll buy you a drink. - Okay, but just a Perrier. The same. . - The same. Why didn't you have kids with me? Hold on. - Its good. Its good - Oh I took the wrong door. - No. - Are you sure ? - Yes. This is the apartment of Maud. - Ah. - Who are you ? - Bacchus Renard, journalist. - Go there. My name is Martial. Hello. - Hello. . - She can't hold the alcohol. She never held out. - Oh yes. - Ah no. - Oh yes. - Ah no, no, no. - Ah, you are. . - In her condition, it's not serious. - Her condition ? - Well, because of the baby. She is pregnant. - Yes, yes, it's not serious. Who exactly is Martial? - The father of my children. I help him out. - Ah. And where does he sleep? - On the couch. - And he sleeps naked? - What are you accusing me of? - You're welcome... - Yes. To have a lover. - So what ? - He's the father of my children. - He still lives with you? - He lives with a woman in Burgundy. They got into a fight, he sublet his apartment, so I'm letting him stay. - Why didn't you say you were with him? - I'm not anymore. - And you're not pregnant? - Yes. - From whom? - From him. - Ah. - If it bothers you, say it. It was not planned that I win, that I get pregnant and it was not expected that you tumble into my life. Now what do we do? - I dunno. - It's due when ? - End of July. - Are you 6 months pregnant? - There. - But you got back together with dad? - Well No, in fact, it's more complicated than that. Sometimes we are more with someone and we get pregnant with him. Other times we would like to be pregnant with someone, but we are not with him and we are already pregnant with another. But we are in love with him. The other. You understand ? - Um yes. - Yeah. Why don't you have a stomach? - He'll come out when he wants. - I'm sure he'll be born the same day as me. They see evil everywhere, except at home. - Hmm, except at home. - What is happening ? - They've been here since yesterday. - You have to tell them to leave! - Wait.. Hello? - You have to tell them to leave. - Go for it. - Yes go on. - Yes, I'm going. Excuse me ! Ouh ouh? Excuse me ? Excuse me ? Ouh ouh! Mrs. Excuse me, but.. You're disturbing a public building site. - No Madam. We pray. - Why ? - So that Maud Crayon's project never sees the light of day. - Despite the debacle, Maud goes to Crayon et Cie every day, decided to finish her mission. - "We, writers, painters, "sculptors, architects, passionate amateurs "beauty so far intact "from Paris, protest "with all our strength, with all our indignation, "in the name of little-known French taste, "against the erection in the heart "of our capital, "the useless and monstrous Eiffel Tower." 1887 : protest against the Eiffel Tower. Among the signatories: Maupassant, Dumas, Prudhomme and so on. Even the best can be wrong. - It's on that page and it's more in that area. There's one like that and there, it's on both sides There you dig. Bacchus Renard. Beep - Bacchus, it's me again. Call me back. - Martial never left, contrary to what he had promised. The scandal is growing. The town hall is forced to suspend the site. - Yes, Bacchus, it's me again. Call me back. - With the interruption, Maud and Didier are stuck. - Crayon et Cie. - Debt is piling up. - Yes I know. In fact, we are waiting for a deadline. - Maud is on a date. - We received your invoice, but... - She's busy, she'll call you back. - Recommended. By the way, I'm not sure I can continue to help you. - We have a contract. - I signed a contract? I haven't signed anything. Waiting, united to the end. - What a big asshole! Maud, more alone than ever, has no news of Bacchus. Are you going to build it, your phallus? - It's not a phallus. - I always knew you were super ass. To end with Martial, she asked Didier to sleep at her place and confessed everything to him. - I said the child was yours. Here. For him, we live a great story and I am in love. Come. Didier agrees to spend a night with Maud. - I'm leaving when everyone is asleep. - Okay. - What is he doing ? - He sleeps badly on the sofa. Thank you. - This is the last time. - Things are bad for your girlfriend. "June 15 will open the trial "against the winner of the Paris City Hall competition, "for the redevelopment of the square of Notre-Dame." Oh ! - So the legs Well, he only has one. Oh no. It's okay, he has two. He has a small femur. - What does it mean ? - Nothing, he has a small femur. Shit. He moves more. - What? - No, that's it, nothing, it's good. . - I never understood anything about these ultrasounds. - Look at him. Look closely, we can see the heart. - No, I can't see it. - But if, look, there. You see ? - Ah yes. - Listen. It's a boy. It's beautiful. - I put it there, I'm sure. Beep - And the file, you found it? - No, but I found the Beranger one. Ah, there he is. The Crayon Affair and the Articles of the Last Days. - Ah yes. Look, I have studied your file carefully and... it's complicated. - Why ? - The opinion is very unfavorable. The people are against you. You have a bad image. They don't like you. They don't like you. They don't like you. - Ah - You need an angle of attack to win. For now, we have nothing solid. - Damned ? - Perhaps. Yes.. No ! Yes ? A third person is here. Shall I bring her in? - Are you waiting for someone ? - No. - Sorry for the delay. Bacchus Renard. Hello. - Monique Delamour... Delatour. - Jurisprudence Buren. A work cannot be attacked not completed. - You too, are you a lawyer? - No. I did a little law. You allow me? Let's go. Cylinders will have been enough to create polemic. Around the site where Daniel Buren has installed his work, the discussion is going well. Mr. and Mrs. Michu speak. They just had to leave it as it is, it's wasted money. It's not made for this frame. It's annoying for Mr. Buren. Buren should have put big palisades. If we could have walked on it, that would have changed everything. - I do not understand that we make mooring bollards like that. We penetrate with Daniel Buren on the site of the 200 columns about which we are unleashed. Especially since the work was interrupted for administrative reasons. An interruption which displeased the artist. -It's as if they entered my studio and criticized unfinished works, that they were exhibited, and that they were judged as they are. This work is not finished - What did you come back for? - For architecture. - Ah. Bacchus did not come back for architecture. In fact, he came back for Maud. For her eyes. For her nose. For her cheekbones. - Maud, your belly. - That's it ! He took his place. - 1h30 for the draft, 15 min to copy it, 26 min for telephone conversation, 12 min taxi ride, pressing. - A pressing? Why ? - For her lawyer dress. - Yes you are right. Oh ! - What? - 2 870 euros. Check. So three and a half hours. 2 870 divided by 3.5, that makes us 800 euros an hour. - They're expensive, the lawyers. - That's why you're not getting divorced. - They're not married. - Tata Coco is right. Coco. I'm not a cake brand. - So 2,870 for lawyers, plus - Plus 984 for supplies Plus 6,032 rent. - 6 032 - Plus 3 600 of loads. - 3,600 more 8,786 salaries. Oh ! 22 272 euros. - What's left? - We have a minus of 834 euros. - Damn it. With my wife, I have a loan on the back. We're going to jail! - I'll get us out of here! - Calm down, Didier. It will be fine. He is shy. - It will be fine. Who is talking about credit? We will manage. - What are we going to do ? - We could sleep for money. Prostitution. - I could film. - I don't prostitute myself. - No one is prostituting himself. - Martine, Hervé's mother, she rents her room to tourists and it pays off. - I have a date. - Didier is married. - I'm not gonna marry her. - Oh. - Hey ! Is it Bacchus, the friend with whom she sleeps without sleeping? - Well, I do not know. - And Coco, is she going out with Didier? - No idea. Since you are not asking me, here I am telling you: I have a girlfriend. - Are you a couple ? - Yeah, for a week. For real this time. - Stylish. Good night. - So good night. - Bacchus Bacchus Bacchus ! I have to go. - What? - I have to go. - Me too, me too, I have to go. - Ouch! - What? What's the matter ? - Nothing, he kicked me. Pardon. Take it, it is for you. - You want to rip me off? It is not signed. I refuse. When we say "see you tonight" without coming, what does that mean? - That means we're scared. - Ah! It is Calinou86. - Oh yeah, she's right. - She knows it by heart. - Papa ! Why do you have your bag? Give it. - Here. Thank you my heart. Sybille wants to take a break. Are you alright, son? - It's okay. You have to sign my newsletter. - Ah. Can I take the last one? ...super weird. - It's Calinou86, go ahead. - Then what do we have? - At 2 p.m., there is Ramses62. - Yeah. - At 4 p.m., there's Monnell. - Monnell. - Monnell72. - Sorry, I'm late. - Honey, I have to do the cardboards. I leave you doing is better. - Oh, Didier. - Yes goodbye. Come on. OK, let's go ! - We attack with the Duren case. - Buren. The Buren case. - Buren. - So they will answer that your project is not a work of art, but... ? - A layout. - ...but an urban development. - Sorry, Martial insisted, he is depressed, he is afraid of being alone. - And there, we take offense. Who has the right to decree what is a work of art? - I am not well. - What is a work of art ? - I'm choking. - Yes. What is it? - My darling. My darling. - Why does he say "my darling"? - Old habit. - There, we dry them! - She worries me. - Architecture, it's art - so you are an artist! - It's not settled. There is a wolf! - Do you have a handkerchief? - Here. - Thank you. - It's okay ? - I assure you he's going to leave. If it's not tomorrow, the day after tomorrow. Otherwise, it's in 2 days, 3 days. Or the day after. But it is imminent. - Why don't you tell him? - I'll go. It's okay ? - Sybille is leaving me. - Ah - Maud, I'm a piece of shit. I have nothing left - But no. - I am incapable. - No ! - But yes ! Kiss me, I'm going to die. - Stop it ! You stop ! Whatever ! Pull yourself together ! - Kiss me. - No ! - Yes ! - Martial, stop! - I want to die! - But stop ! - I want to die. - Martial ! - I would have liked you to fall in love with me again. I would have liked There. - Bacchus Bacchus "Bacchus, if you a step to the right and want to go back "taking a step to the left is impossible, "because space and time have changed. "We are not going back. "A return is always a new go. "Our story begins. "Not like on the stairs "where I met you and where I thought I'd pass out. "Not like at the town hall, "where I passed out for real. "But elsewhere, in another space, "another time. That's why it's starting." Oh ! Aren't you stopping him? - It's not a terrorist attack. - It's an assault! - Getting slapped is like being walked on. - Ah yes ? Sorry for your feet. More more Leave me! - Your husband came to get you. - Good evening. The noose tightens around my crayon... Maud Crayon. - Bacchus, we're back. - I can't do it with this cold! It's April 24th! Can I have the down jacket? - No, it's for 8 p.m.! - Oh ! - We're going back, come on! - Good evening, the noose is tightening. According to the polls, the results are unanimous. 89% of Parisians are for the cancellation of the Notre-Dame square project. From Paris. Here. - Slapping soldiers in the middle of a trial, you like to put spikes in your wheels. It's over there. - No, Monique! - Over there ! - The work, undertaken in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal, are neither an individual administrative decision derogating from the rules set by law or regulation, nor a decision restricting public freedoms, nor a police measure, that, therefore, the said decision did not have to be motivated by application of the law of July 11, 1979, considering that the authorization of Mr. Prefect from May 16, 1986, concerned the realization of the whole of the work of Mr. Buren, the trenches, as well as the pumps, which were the necessary complement, than the realization of the automatic switch has been authorized by a separate building permit, that the contested decision did not intervene before the authorizations necessary are met, it therefore seems that the parallel drawn by the defense does not stand up to even a basic examination of the rule of law. We cannot therefore invoke the alleged Buren case law in this case. - It is true ? - Shit - That doesn't sound wrong. It doesn't sound wrong. - Yes, yes. Start with that, okay? - Okay. That it... - Oh ! - She is dead. - A year of internship, we got attached. - Oh, come on, come on. - Clarisse, did you take my robe? - No, sorry. - I will ask for an adjournment. - An adjournment? - Oh no. We will plead. - I call the defense. Master He's coughing. - Master Renard. - Master Fox - Silence ! Please. Go for it. - I would like, If you allow it, do an experiment. I would like that everyone and each look at his neighbor or her neighbor. - What does he do ? - No idea. - And slap him. You're afraid. You're afraid to slap and take one back. I can't blame you. Because I too am afraid. I have always lived in fear. We all live in fear. Simply because we are human beings. But Maud Crayon was not afraid. - He's in love. - She was not afraid to make a modern proposition. Yes, modern. And in return, what does my client receive? A real slap? - Do you think he's single? - It's certain. - We are not attending the trial against Maud Crayon, but well at the trial of fear against change. This fear that freezes us like gargoyles. So today I am speaking to you, and I ask you, isn't it time to slap Notre-Dame ? Are you sure it's not time to slap us collectively and free us? To free us from our chains. Yes, from our chains - Follow us. - Of our emotional chains, cultural and sexual! Yes, sexual! I am Bacchus Renard, journalist - and fuck you. - Regarding chemical attack, we have very little information. It is a toxic gas of type B35. No claim was made. The metro was closed. People took refuge in cars, cinemas It is a state of emergency, a state of fear. - So you're a lawyer? - Exactly. - I love this job. - Martial. Martial... Didier is not the father of this child. - Is it the lawyer? - No, it's you. - What? I am going to be a dad ? This child you are carrying is it from me? - Yes. We had a child of the meeting, a child of reconciliation and now, a child of separation. - Maud, you can't do this to me. Not now. - Yes. - This child is ours. We did it together, we're going to have it together. - Yes. Together, but separate. - It's over, over, then? - Yes. - Does that mean we'll not sleep anymore in the same bed? - No. - Will there be no more kisses? - No. - No more little pillow? No more small glass of water? - Well, no. - Will you ever stroke my hair again? Will we ever sleep together again? Will we ever make love again? That's it ? But it's horrible. It's like we're dead. - A little, but we're alive. - Never again will I kiss your feet I will never kiss your eyes again I'll never touch your hair again Never again We won't be two - Never again My head in the crook of your neck I will never listen to your pulse again Never again My cheek against your cheek Never again You will look for lice No more caresses on your buttocks Neither night nor day - No more sweat - No fear ever again Forever forever - Never again will I taste your tongue Never again It's our two joys that sway Never again The smell of your tanned skin Never again Our naked bodies in salt water Never again Your smile, your cat-look -Never again My hips, my lalalala Never again Legs in the air, head down Never again - The ups, the downs - No more caresses - On your buttocks - Neither the night - Nor the day No more sweat No fear Never for ever, forever Maud left rue Duperré. She returned the piano to Martial and threw away the old sofa. She moved into a 3-room apartment with a clear view. As for Bacchus Renard, how to say Illegal practice of the profession of lawyer, identity theft, a few unpaid arrears - he was good for prison. - We have Nathalie Simonet live from the Champs-Élysées. Chemical attack was just a laundry accident. This is where the 45 kg of red dye pigments poured into the wind tunnels spreading in the streets. More fear than harm, even if allergic Parisians are in quarantine. - Calm has returned to Paris. The trial was over and the verdict was final. Maud Crayon's daring project would never see the light of day. - Here, it belongs to you. - Oh thank you. You know, Maud, failures are like adolescence or baldness, the important thing is to get over it. I know I am not mistaken. We adore it - Wait, Coco, we'll help you. - Great, take this. - That. - There you go, and that too. They are nice. What are they doing for the holidays? - They go to Burgundy with their father. - First caesarean? - Yes. Isn't that cool? - Oh yeah. - Come on, let's go. You have to prepare your things, you go to your father. - Mom, why do we do it every other week? - Because we have two parents. - Exactly. - Did you stop wanting to grapple with me? - Come on, hop on.
