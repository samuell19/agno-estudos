Subtitles by explosiveskull We're gonna get dragged! We've gotta get out of here! Just five minutes more! Over there! I found it. I finally found it. Okay, let's get out of here! See? Told you she'd be here, sir. I kept my part of the agreement. Well, a deal is a deal. Oh? Wow! You are really generous, Mister Rackham, sir. Enjoy it. Whoa. What... What are you do... Hey, what are you doing, fellows? Let go of me! No, no, no! No! Back to business. "Herodotus was considered the father of history." Cool. Super cookie. Wow, this guy was the bomb. Hey, you're really hitting those books hard. Tell me about it. First year of archaeology is super demanding. I don't get what you find so interesting about this old stuff. Oh. Now I get it. Now that is something worth studying. She's hot. Hey, don't talk like that about Sara. Don't start again. Nobody buys that you know her. Actually, we even kissed. Okay, just once. Ugh. Here we go. Then we barely saw each other after that. You know, she's been going away on long expeditions, and I've been studying and working. Um, kind of left things in the air. Oh, sure. You kissed this girl? But even long distance, I feel her here, close to my heart. I can sense the trembling. I can really sense the trembling. It's Sara! Yeah. And I just got a call from Scarlett Johansson. - Hey, watch it! - Sorry. Tad, you should try living in reality for a change. Sara? Tad. I hope I'm not interrupting. Not at all. Um... Hey, I saw you on the cover of National Petrographic. I know, right? Did you get the invitation to the exhibition? Yeah! I can't wait to be there! Wonderful. I can't wait to see you. Me, too. The exhibition opens at the Luxorious Hotel, in Las Vegas. - Need directions? - Let me find a pen. Whoa! - Where are you going? - What? Nowhere, I'm still here. No, no, I didn't mean you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - My bad! - Tad, do you want me to hang up? Stop right there! Okay, so I won't hang up. No, wait! Are you okay? Yeah. So, Luxorious Hotel? Yes. First, take the I-290 west for 30 miles... I-290 west for 30 miles! - And turn the second left. - Right, keep left. And then go straight. You'll get to a pyramid shaped hotel. Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't miss it. Big pyramid-shaped hotel. I got it. No, I didn't. What? Did you get it or not? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! - Whoa! Bye, Sara! - Wha... Tad? Phew! That was close. Oops. Sorry. Is, uh... Is everything okay in there, boss? Stones! You're fired. Oh, my lucky cologne. Smell that. My Indy hat, my fancy tuxedo, and my bow tie. Two shirts, suspenders, new underwear... I think that's all. Do you think she'll like it, Jeff? Jeff! Ready, Jeff? Let's go see Sara. Sir, are you all... Water! Water! Water! You? Need water! It's you! I haven't had a drink in 20 days. No, no, no, stop! Ugh! That's... Aw! Oh! You can't imagine the trip I had to find you. Ah! It's so good to see you! It's not possible! What are you doing here? Oh. It's a long story, I'd better not tell you. But I will. You see, when you left my lost city, I was judged for letting you go. The Mummy Court exiled me! They kicked you out? Yeah, all because of you! Well, and a bad deal with my lawyer. But that's another story. The thing is, I had to say goodbye to my home tomb and then travel further than I ever had before. I got lost in the desert following these strange lines. I didn't know what to do. And then, I remembered you. My one and only human friend! - Friend? - Oh! You're right. We're more like brothers. Uh, can you please control this little monster? Jeff, down, boy! Uh. Well, sorry, but I was just leaving. But I just got here! I'm going to Vegas to see Sara. Sara? Oh. My Sara? Oh. I miss her so much. What are we waiting for? Oh, no, no, no. You are not coming. - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. Yes! Whoo-hoo! I'm the king of the world! Hey, hey! Get back here, you deserter! Could you please sit down and stop drawing attention to yourself? What is with you? Listen, you're a mummy. You scare people. In my world, you're a zombie. Zombie. Sounds good! I like that name. Excellent. Now please be quiet. Okay, okay, I'm sorry. You got it. I won't move a muscle. Look! Eh! Oh. What's this? Oh, my... It's a necklace! - It's for me, right? - Hey! That is not for you! I think it looks great with my eyes. It's not for you! Oh! It's for Sara. Yes, it's for Sara. I knew it. Come on, tell me everything. I'm a relationship expert. Five hundred years of experience. I know everything about women. Hey! See? Total heartbreaker. Okay. I'm going to ask her to be my girlfriend. Huh. I'm not sure how to tell you this, Tad, but, uh, she seems a little out of your league. You know, like you're, uh, punching above your weight. Like she's a 10 and you're a two. She's hot, you're not. She's too good for you. Thank you for being so encouraging. What are friends for? Friends? Brothers! Awesome! What is "awesome"? Well, people say it when they really like something... Something super impressive. Oh. I get it. Like the Machu Picchu, like the Pyramids of Lima Culture, like Lake Titicaca. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all that. So, now you stay in the car. Don't move a muscle, you hear me? Wow. Look at that, Jeff. Mr. Stones? Hi, I'm Tiffany Maze, Professor Lavrof's assistant. Oh, hi. Nice to meet you. Oh! What a cute little dog. Who's a good boy? Wanna shake? Uh, sorry, he's just not very connected to this world. Mrs. Lavrof told me to take care of you. I'm gonna do my thesis on her latest discoveries. Oh, wow! You're majoring in archaeology, too? Boston University. I'm a sophomore. Chicago. But I'm just a freshman. But compared to Sara... She is amazing. I'm learning so much from her. It's incredible where she is now. The most important archaeologist nowadays. I'd give anything to be like her. Come on. Sara's waiting for you. The bust there, and the suits of armor there. Oh, careful. Hey! Belzoni! How are you doing, my little bird man? They're good friends. Tad. You're here. Sara. Sara! I'm so happy to see you. Come on, let me show you the exhibit.

Hello! Awesome! Oh, man! King Midas' papyrus! Can you read the inscription? "Made in China"? The papyrus, not the stand. Yeah, the... Sorry, my bad. Ahem. Looks like hieroglyphic writing. Exactly. This is what I've been working on all this time, Midas' magic collar. It's made up of three pieces. One of them seems to be in what is called the Red Temple of Baal. I found these hieroglyphics that point to the exact location of the temple. If the collar really exists... So does Midas' golden touch! The power to turn everything you touch into gold. Tad, I've been so busy that I... Sara... Um... I... I have something to ask you. Go on. Would you be my... Be my... Mummy! Be your mummy? - Sara! - You? Get over here. Give me a hug. I told you to wait in the car! What are you doing here? Ugh. I better not tell you. But I will. You see, when you left my lost city... Oh, yeah, that's great. I will tell her later. Miss Lavrof? The script for tonight. Hey, what's with Elvis? He's an old friend. - Right, Mummy? - Hi! You call him Mummy? Yeah, he doesn't preserve very well. Hey! Please, excuse me. I still have so much to do.

Come here! And don't leave the room, okay? Not awesome. Hi, there. Uh, nice to meet... Hey, how are you? Nice to meet you... Hello! My name is Tad. Am I speaking the wrong language? Hey, Belzoni, good to see you! Waiter? What do you mean? Not a chance. This is my best suit. Aw... Whoa. No... Yeah. Uh-oh. I'll take care of that, sir. Keep an eye on that one. An ancient relic has revealed the real story of King Midas. It's a papyrus called "A Sacrifice for Love." It shows him as an all-powerful king who defeated all his enemies for Apollo. Grateful, Apollo bestowed upon King Midas a collar with three golden pieces. The collar would bring the wearer the power to turn anything he touched into gold. Midas amassed piles and piles of gold. Everything he laid his hands on would turn into the precious metal. But this golden touch soon became a curse. His daughter reached out to hug him and she too was turned into gold. Devastated, Midas returned to Apollo and begged for mercy. Apollo told Midas to get rid of his collar, offering each of its three pieces to a god in different temples around the world. Midas followed Apollo's orders, and by giving up an immense power, brought his daughter back to life. Or in other words, he made a sacrifice for love. Wow. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to present to you my most important discovery, the definitive proof that thousands of years ago - King Midas and his collar actually existed. - Huh? A gift? The Midas Papyrus. Now, this is a party. Hmm! We've got it, boss. - Go, Belzoni! - Get him! Yeah! Uh-oh. - You? - Hey, thanks. No, I got it! I got it! No, I got it! Huh? Tad! You come with me. Get your hands off me! Sara! - Tad! - Sara! Find me! Sara... Wake up, Tad. Find me. Tad, come back to me. Tad. Wake up, Tad. Wait. Where's Sara? They took her! It's a kidnapping! Like Pizarro and Atahualpa! Like Cortés and Montezuma! Actually like Cortés... Tad, are you all right? Yeah. This is built to last. Wait a minute... Sara's notebook. She wanted me to have it. I bet those goons took Sara so she could lead them to Midas' collar. Then we're gonna have to find it first. With this, we can be one step ahead of them and rescue Sara. Look at this. The Red Temple of Baal. Sara believed this was Mida'' first stop on his pilgrimage. The key to its location is in these hieroglyphics, but I can't decipher them. Mmm. Let me see. I'll see if I can find something about Tartessus' language. Great. We should also look for its dialects. Good thinking. Oh. There's no reference of those ancient languages anymore. Total dead end. There has to be a way. "There you should find Baal." What did you just say? No, no, no, the other stuff. Oh. In English! How can you read that? Well, dead tongues are my specialty. Check it out. See? Totally dead. Your friend is a bit weird. You have no idea. Here it says, "Four suns toward the dawn, "by horse from Setefilla, "there you should find Baal." Ta-da! "Setefilla..." Sorry, buddy. Setefilla is what the Tartessians called the city of Seville. "Four suns toward the dawn." A sun was a day in ancient times. By horse... 120 miles. 120 miles towards the dawn. To the east! Granada! The Red Temple of Baal is in Granada! That's it, Tad. There's the Alhambra. The Moorish palace also known as "The Red One." That's where they're taking Sara! Get ready, guys. We're going to Spain. - Spain! - Yes. - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - Wait for us, Midas. Hold on, Sara. Tad Stones, on the case. For the last time, how do I use this to find Midas' collar? I won't tell you a thing. Leave her. There are other ways to make her cooperate. Will it work, sir? That truth serum might be out of date. Well, there's only one way to find out. Mmm? What do you think of me? Uh... Er... Uh... Sir... Come on, don't be shy. - Well? - No, I can't... You... You are an arrogant bully, uncool and very cheap! I'm sorry. Shut it! And you're also a daddy's boy. Oh! And your feet stink! Your turn. Where are the pieces of the collar? I won't say a thing. Don't hold back. You want to say it. No... My head... Midas... That's it! Where are the pieces? Everything is in my notebook. Tad... Tad... What just happened? I believe you overdosed her, sir. Idiots! Who's that Tad she was mumbling about? Sir, I think he is that guy with the very big nose. I want that notebook! Find me that fool of a Tad! ♪ A little less conversation, a little more action... ♪ What? Could you lower your voice and stop drawing attention? Someone's jealous of my manly voice. Hmm? We need to find you a better disguise. What are you talking about? I look fabulous. So, this is the place we're going to? Awesome, awesome... Listen, this thing says food is great in Spain. - You're a real face-stuffer, right? - Mmm. Awesome, awesome... Uh, Tad, what's an Antonio Banderas? I can't believe we're about to find such a big discovery. We can make history. Yeah. It's not gonna be easy. We have to decipher these notes to find the Temple of Baal. Taxi! To the Alhambra, please. Of course, mi amigo. Come on in. Thanks. Hang on. Where's Mummy? He said he was going to find something to make him fit in. Fit in? How is he supposed to fit... I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I can't believe everyone dresses like this here. It's so strange! Ta! Ta! Ta-ta-ta! Olé! Olé! Olé! That is the most beautiful elegance I have ever seen. Oh! Such a nice guy! Are you happy now? I hope you don't keep on saying that I draw attention. Hmm. I'll take you to the end of the world, if you ask for it. For now, just take us to the Alhambra. Well, we can go there, too. Oh! Uh-oh. Here we go. They have the notebook, sir. What are the orders? - Take it off the hands of that clown. - Roger that. Please, don't hurt Tad. Oh, don't worry, we won't cause him a lot of pain, I guess. Wealth? All this is for wealth? That's so cute. No. The power of Midas goes way beyond wealth, my dear. What is that? Something I bought from an antiques dealer. Midas' power is the power of the gods. The power to rule the world. And it will be mine. Ay, mi palomita. It's hard to believe you're from this world. Technically, I'm not really from this world. Long story. - You'll see, when I was a... - Stop it! Ah! Do you know those guys behind us? Oh, no. We're in trouble, guys. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Are we in danger? Don't worry, my palomita. I swear nothing will happen to you while I'm here. They're getting closer! They want the notebook. Ooh! What a nice souvenir! It's not for you! Hey, what did you throw it away for? Come on, help me! Oh. I get it, I get it, I get it! There you go! Boom! Yes! - Hello. - Oh, hi. Watch out! Quick! Release the hood! Jeff! Oh, God! Oh, God! We're not gonna get out of this! Siesta time. Driver down! Driver down! Tad! It's okay Tiff, I got this! Get out of the way! Incoming! What is this thing? - Watch out! - What? The bridge! Huh? Awesome! Come on. Let's move before they come back. So this is the siesta thing the guidebook was talking about. So, somewhere around here Midas offered the first piece of the collar. Ah. Look at this color. Look at this sun. Look at this light. Ugh. How I miss my muddy tombs. According to the legend, Apollo taught Midas a great lesson. What's that? That your wealth is not as important as the people you have close to you. And what's more, it's worth making a sacrifice for love. Yeah, that's it. I'm afraid we did not get the notebook, sir. You let that idiot escape? He is a genius, sir. High-level training. Total pro! A genius? Really? Total pro. I don't care! I want that notebook. Got it? Yes, sir. The notebook, or my life. Hang on a second. This looks familiar. Tiff, look at this. The drawing looks like that fountain! Oh. There's an inscription here. "Centuries after Midas entered the temple of Baal, "the sultans protected it with 12 beasts." Nine, 10, 11, 12. Twelve lions. It has to be here. There should be a lever of some sort. It would take a bulldozer to move these things. Tad, it moved! Hey, Tiff, look. There's a mark on this lion. This one has a mark too. And it turns! Great. Let's try to turn all the heads with a mark. Come on, Tad. You're doing it wrong. It'd be better to push it from the other side. It would be better if you gave me a hand. Oh. That's funny. That's really funny. Help me with this one, Tiff. Come on, Tiff! Nailed it! Ugh. Sorry. That's something I do when I... You really have no self-respect, do you? Huh. Maybe I can find my cousins there! Belzoni, wait for us here. And take care of Jeff. Careful, guys. It's slippery. Mmm-mmm! Tasty. Mmm. Ooh. What's that noise? Rats! I hate them! Rats! Tiff, Tiff. Relax. Will you just stop screaming? You'll scare them. What's wrong with them anyway? They're so cute. Aww. I feel like I'm back home. Ew! Ugh! Gross! Guys, this is a labyrinth. It'll take forever to find the way to the temple. Hold on a second. I'll ask. Ask? Who? Who do you think? Him. Do you know where is Baal's temple? Sorry. I think I didn't say it right. My rat-morse isn't the best. Are you nuts? Do you really expect that a rat... Do you know where is Baal's temple? Where is Baal's temple? The temple. T-E-M-P-L-E. Temple! Got it. Let's go. Oh! Heels... We're going to follow a rat. Seriously? Hi, birdie. You! Lead us to your owner, or we will kill your feathered friend! This way! That's a good one. This guy is hilarious. Okay, okay, I got it. Thanks, my little friend. See you! Great. Now what? He says we have to enter there. Are you kidding? The rat has spoken. Come on, guys. We didn't get to this point for nothing. You and your rat! Mmm! The guidebook was right. Spanish food is awesome. The coast is clear. Come on. Whoever said archaeology isn't glamorous? That wasn't so bad. Uh-oh. Huh? Baal! We made it. I told you! The rat was right! The rat was right! Hey, look. A golden trail. Midas was here. Midas' collar piece. Uh. Guys, let's get out of here, okay? This place is creepy even for my standards. No, no, no, no, no! Oh! Let's pray to the Pachamama. Oh, Goddess of Earth, please, help us at this time of... Oh. I guess she isn't listening. Maybe she was listening. The room is a trap! - We've got to get out of here! - Hold on! The water has to drain out somewhere. Tad! I can't hold on much longer! I found a way out. Help me! Huh? I'm fine, by the way. Not that anyone asked. Oh, I'm sorry, little guy. We'll find you another sewer. We did it. Tad, we did it! - We did it! My gosh! - We did it! Yeah! Congratulations to the happy couple. Tiffany? - Tad? - Sara! Stop right there! You release her! You know, as soon as possible. Give me the piece or I'll end her. Tad, don't do it. I'm sorry. I have no choice. Please. And the notebook, please. Give me the notebook, or you won't see her again. You're despicable. Yes. It's all here. Let's go! You have no right! We didn't do all that work just to have you steal the piece. That's what happens when you play against Jack Rackham. Useless mutt! Sara! I thought I lost you. Oh! I wish I had bodily fluids so I could cry at reunions. Belzoni. Hey, buddy. Glad to see you. Jeff, what happened to you? We need to move fast before Rackham finds the other pieces of the collar. I wouldn't worry about that. Tad, what are you talking about? He wanted the notebook, but never said anything of it being complete. Well done, Tad! Uh? Yeah? Well, no, I think... So, where do we go? To Cappadocia, in Turkey. There are hundreds of temples there. Rackham won't be able to find the right one without these pages. That would give us a head start. So let's go, guys! Let's go to Turkey. Um, here we are. Thanks. How much is it? This fare, I do it for free, my palomita. Oh. Thank you. What is this "palomita" he keeps talking about? My gift to you. It embodies the heart, soul and the belly of our people. I'll be waiting for you under the lights of the Alhambra. And you know it. Spaniards are crazy. Okay. That Captain will try to find us a spot on his ship. Great. Check this, Tad. This is the area where we should find the next piece. Temple of Ariniddu. Baal's wife. Goddess of the light. Cool! So what about the third temple? I don't know much about it. The only clue is this symbol that appears in everything related to Midas. It seems to be some sort of personal mark. Wow. You rock, Sara. Tad... Yes, Sara? Uh... I wanted you to know that after all this time we've been apart, I... Come on, are we leaving or what? I'm dying here. Again. Oh. Sorry, I... Okay. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Hey, guys, I got us a trip. Tad, you're the best. By the mummy Juanita's teeth, that is a floating metropolis. Uh... Not that one. That one. Forget metropolis. That's not even a tiny little village. - Hey, Tiff. - Hi. Can I ask you something? Go for it. Oh! That's so sweet. So, do you think Sara will like it? Oh. Sara. Yeah. I don't know if it's good enough for her. Is everything okay? Perfect. It's just that I'm a feet-on-the-ground type of guy, you know. A feet-under-the-ground type, actually. Oh, my... Ooh. You don't look much better than I do. All that's happened got me thinking. Yeah. Come on, cheer up, everything'll be fine. I've been so focused on my work, I feel I've left people out of my life. Oh. One thing's for sure. Talking won't solve anything, darling. You've got to take the initiative. Less conversation, more action. That's actually good advice. Ugh. Well, I got to confess it isn't mine. That's what the guy in Vegas was singing about. It took me a while to learn the lyrics. Well, can you try it on me? Just to see how it looks. Oh. Yeah, good idea. I think you're right. I should stop talking and start taking action. There you go. That's my Sara. Thanks. You've been very helpful. Enjoy the advice. It's for free. I'll keep on evacuating the paella. Oh! Here it comes. Okay. More action. Get right to the point. It looks great on you. Thank you. Unbelievable. They haggle over everything here. Ho-ho! This is amazing! We're about to find the second piece of the collar. Water? Don't be so excited. Rackham could be around. Take your stuff. We can't lose any time. Okay, let's go. "Okay, let's go." This can't be happening. Let me see... "This can't be happening." Are you serious? What are you doing? Well, you're always complaining about my human disguises so, from now on, I'm going to be exactly like you, Mr. Perfect Human. Check this out. I'm Tad Jones, I can't dance... It's official. Your friend is a total freak. Come on. Mummy Bones on the case. That is... I... I am not at all like that! And what are you doing with a paella dish? It's my present. I love it. I'm taking it everywhere. I would never wear that thing on my back. Okay, fine. Let's see what the little monster thinks. Hi, critter. I'm Tad. Super Cookie! No, Jeff. I'm Tad. Come here. Don't pay attention to that impostor. - Take this one. Here. - I'm the real Tad. Super Cookie! I want three teams. Spread out and keep your eyes open. There are dozens of temples around. Yes, sir. Report back here in three hours. Okay, this is the place. Oh! What a view. Isn't it beautiful, Sara? - Huh? - Sure. Yeah, well... It's getting dark. We should all split up to locate the temple. - Great. I'll go with... - Oh! Oh! With me. Me and Tad. Brothers for life. Let's see who finds the temple first. Boys versus girls. Let's go, Tiffany. Oh. Thank goodness I stepped in. What's going on here? I was trying to spend some time with Sara. Haven't you noticed something different about her? Well, she has been acting kind of distant. Of course! How would she not? You're not being the knight in shining armor she needs. The what? But fear not. We'll make Sara melt for your bones. They don't call me the Great Conquistador of Peru for nothing. You just need some practice. I can't believe it. If we find the second piece, we'll be just one step away from Midas. Tiffany, there are too many signs telling Midas' power is not something to mess with. Are you saying we shouldn't search for the collar? I'm just saying that maybe the collar shouldn't see the daylight. Mmm. Ah! Hi, gorgeous. Mummy, this isn't going to work. Mummy? Who's Mummy? I'm Sara Lavrof. No, no, no, no. I can't do this. Come on. Do you love Sara or not? With all my heart. But then aren't you willing to do whatever it takes? Sara, I... Yes? I know you have a lot on your mind. Yes? And you almost have no time to think about the present, which is where I am. Mmm. But what I truly want is to live in the same age as you, no matter which one, you know, past, present or future. I... I want to be your partner in the big adventure of life. Mmm! Hey! Whoa! What are you doing? Oh, sorry. But that was just so beautiful. You have to tell Sara all that stuff. She's gonna love it. Any woman will fall in love with you now. Tad! There are no symbols from the notebook here either. It's impossible. We've looked at over 20 temples. We'd better find the right one before total pro Tad does. You? A total pro? If it doesn't work out with Sara, you've got Crazy Eyes down there. Shh. Look at that. This is the temple. Let's get back to Rackham. Maybe the others had more luck. Stay here with Jeff. Holler if you see those guys coming back. Great. That was scary. Huh? Tad. We've been looking for you. The second piece! I... I got it, Sara. I got it. And not just that. Look. That mountain. Midas' symbol! Midas didn't make the last offering in an existing temple. He built one for Apollo. The third piece has got to be there! Yes. We have to hurry and get it before Rackham. Or we can destroy this one. Destroy it? The biggest discovery in history? You can't be serious. Tiffany, we can't let Rackham get the power of Midas. But, Sara, we're so close. Tad, let's end this now. No, Tad. Don't give it to her. It's crazy. Sara, isn't it better that we get all the pieces? The power of the gods does not belong in the hands of mortals. If Rackham gets the necklace, he'll be invincible. Wait. Where's Tiffany? I can't believe it! Sara, I'm sorry... I have to find the third piece and destroy it before Rackham gets it. Sara, wait for me! No, Tad, I just need to be alone. You fools! You mean to tell me that between all of you and after all these days of searching you've found nothing? This is useless! That meathead in the hat has played me! I wanna be on the winning team. Hmm. Ugh! Finally, you're here! Where have you been? Hey, are we going back with Sara? She's gone. And Tiffany? She's gone too. It's official. You're a total disaster with women. - How could I be such an idiot? - Well, do you want my opinion? All I had to do was give her the piece. We'd have destroyed it and that's it, end of story. You know, in 500 years I have seen all kinds of love disasters, and yours is one of the worst. Please, don't start again. Seriously, I never saw anyone fail so many times. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, I get it. I get it. But I also never saw anyone cross the whole world for love. Now, you must complete your training. I... I'm not sure if I'm ready. Of course you are. You have worked so hard to get the woman you love. Now, she needs you more than ever. You're right. I've never thought I'd say this, but you're right. I have to help her. That's my brother. Come on, tiger. Tiger. Here I come, Sara. Tad Stones, on the case. Come on, one more step. I can't go any further, Tad. I can't feel my legs! My legs! Oh, no! Sara. Over there! Rackham. We have to hurry. Oh. No, no, no, no, no. Now you want me to climb down? This is a violation of human rights. First, you're not human. And second, there's no time to climb down. Hey, that's my present. What are you doing? Using it. You don't know what you're doing, Tiffany. All right. Jeff, come here. Come on. Get over here. This thing can have so many functions! Carefully, we don't want to... Hey! - Uh... - Huh? What the heck is that? You again? Total pro. Tiffany? Tad? Sara. What are you doing here? I couldn't leave you on your own. Sara, I'm... Stop it! Let's move on. We're almost there. Apollo. What about the altar? Where's the piece? Midas built this temple to do the last offering to Apollo. There is only one place to find the piece. You. Bring me the piece. Absolutely not. Okay, okay. I'm going. Hey, you. Don't be so rude. Tad? I'm not Tad! I'm Midas! I possessed Tad's body, and I'm not going to give you the collar! Oh! That hurts. What the heck are you saying? I honestly had no idea, I had to try something. Oh. He really has no shame. Now, put it on me. Thank you, loser. Okay, you have what you wanted. Now, let them go. There's a problem, darling. I never let the losing team win. What? We had a deal! You get the power and I get the fame. And you don't hurt them. Can you believe these kids? They are so naive! You know? That oddball is right. - Huh? - Okay, nobody move. - Oh? - Just give me the collar and let us all go, and... Oh! No! You don't get it. Now, I have the power of Midas! Uh-oh. Run! Oh. Hello. Muah! I love this thing. Oh, gosh. I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die. You are already dead! Run! Huh... We have to stop him. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm on it. Are you all right? Yeah, I just need a minute. Hello! This guy's on fire! Let me borrow this. Let's all split up and surround him. There you are. Go! Oof! Oops! Where are you going? Thank you. Uh... I'm sorry, I didn't... Total pro. Don't forget me! I'm getting tired of you! Sara! No. What did you accomplish? Say goodbye to her. We did it, Sara. It's over. Tad. Sara? Oh, no. No, no, no, no. This can't be happening. Not to you. No! Oh, no. This is not good. Okay. Okay. - There has to be a way to stop it. - Tad. The sacrifice. Midas got his daughter back. The collar, I have to destroy it! No! This is all my fault. I should have destroyed that piece. - Tad... - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't be, Tad. It's been the most amazing adventure. - All these days with you. - Sara, no. I wouldn't trade that for the world. Please, don't go. - Tad. - Sara. I... I love... No. No. No. No. Tad! Tad! We got to leave now! Tad, come on! Just go. I'm gonna stay. All I ever wanted was to be with you. I love you. What... - Hi. - Sara? Oh, Tad was willing to die for her. A sacrifice for love. Sara. - Hey, guys. Burger? - Thank you. Hey, fellas. Thanks for coming. Oh. Great party, Tad. Where's your girlfriend? Huh? Don't you know? She's out there making big discoveries. No, seriously, she's about to come. Oh. Sure, sure... No, come on. She'll be here right now. Hey, how are you doing. How is my tiger? Tad? - Hi, Sara. - Hi, sweetie. Hey, check this out. No more party for them. So, what are you going to do now? I'll go back to Paititi. This will pay my way back in. Oh. They're going to go crazy for it. They love gold there. I'm gonna miss you so much. I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry... Ugh. I still have no fluids, I can't cry. I don't want to see you cry. I waited for you at the Alhambra, and you didn't show up. You? How did you... Your little friend has guided me to you. Ratty! Oh! I'm happier than a cockroach in a latrine! How I like to see you smile, my palomita. Uh, I'm starting to be worried about the meaning of "palomita." Ah! Who cares? Let's start a real party! Oh! She drives me crazy. You're going to miss him, too. He's probably the most annoying, irritating, badly-dressed sidekick ever. But you're right, I am gonna miss him. I know this isn't the same, but maybe this will cheer you up. Are you serious? Hmm. Yeah! Uh, sorry. You know, it's something I do when I get, uh... You still want to be my girlfriend? Come on! Let's dance, everybody! One, two, three! Hey, hey! Hey-ah! Subtitles by explosiveskull
