[music continues in background] -[woman] You're the best. -Mm-mm. Yes! Time for drinks! -[man] Yes, it is. -[car horn] [woman] Cuidado. Cuidado, mi amor. Be careful.

Can we talk about Postal Service's set tonight? -Why is that guy so sad? -What? He literally looks like somebody put glasses on a slice of Wonder Bread. You talking about that dude from Postal Service? -[Erin] Yeah! -It's accurate. -[woman] Baby, not you, too. -Thank you. All right, toast to another successful Neon Classic. -[man whooping] -Yes, best year yet! [instant camera clicks] -For your cray-ass kids. -What? -You gotta shake it! -Baby, don't shake it, that's a myth. It's not a myth. -Look. -Oh. [woman] Look at us. We were so happy. Idiots. I don't know if you know this, man, but love is a lie. Bitch, please. I'm sorry. It's just tonight was terrible. Me and my man broke up, of nine years. No big deal. I'm moving to San Francisco, 'cause I got my dream job. Career girl over here, -doing the damn thing. Getting it done. -Okay. -You know? -Yeah. Time's up. And he just didn't want to do long distance. -Wow! -I know. Really? With FaceTime? -With everything. -And high-speed internet? -That's what I said. -I mean, that's fucked up. Thank you, that's what I said. Why he leave you like that? [cracking] He didn't even wanna try. Why he won't try? Look at you with your pretty teeth and shit. Thank you, I told him I have pretty teeth! Oh, my God! What man don't wanna put his dick in your mouth with those pretty teeth chomping on that dick? -[sobbing] Thank you. -[sighs] You know, I got to stop going to Craigslist to find dick. -You do. -I do! -You're beautiful. -Am I? Come on, girl. I feel like we're before-and-after pictures right now. Huh! When's this train coming? I'm kinda over this conversation to be honest. What the fuck just happened?

I'm showing this brownstone in Cobble Hill for three million dollars. God bless the middle-aged whites. Keeping a bitch paid, it's like reparations, you know? [laughs] I would love for you to meet some of my friends. How would you feel about that? Mm. Kissing you is nice, but it doesn't absolve you from answering me. -Fuck it. We can talk later. -Mm-hmm. [door shuts] Dude... I just went to pet a Chihuahua outside our building, and it was a fucking rat. Oh, my God, I need coffee. Coffee, coffee, please. Please, love me right! -Rough night? -Oof. Popped by Casablanca to meet up with Sasha and Rory, right? You know, before I went to Leah's or whatever. And Sasha's dating this 22-year-old femme goddess. Seriously, you gotta check her Instagram. Oh, my favorite mug. You love me so much. I think it's very cute that you have a girlfriend. You guys have been together for like four months now, right? I don't have a girlfriend. Leah... is a girl, who is my friend, who I see... on consecutive nights, and whose company I enjoy more than anyone else's in the whole entire world. Whatever. Kindly leave your heteronormative labels in a motherfucking box, to the motherfucking left. -Thank you! -You love her. Whatever. [man] Morning, ladies. [chuckles] Wow, did I sleep late or what? -Mm. -Morning. -Sorry, morning breath. -[both chuckle] I'm gonna... [laughs] [clears throat] -Yes? -You're gonna break up with him, or... [scoffs] We are just settled into a routine. We don't have to be all over each other to prove that we're in love. Sure, lit, but also you hate him, so... Remember when we talked about cleaning your room? Did you not hear me? Or were you like, "I'm not gonna do that anyway." [in German accent] Now, what can I make you for breakfast? [both] Mwah! Ooh. [both] Mwah! -Oh-ho. That's good. -Mm-hmm. -[Erin] Two of 'em. -I just creamed my pajamas. [Erin] Right in them pajamas. There's my breakfast. [Erin] Oh, there it is. -Get that. Get that brekkie. -[man] Mm. [whispers] That's all I need. I love you. [chuckling] Love you. [man] Off to the market! Shut up. -Go clean your room. -Um, go clean my room? -A little bit. -I love you. Let me just... -[makes kissy noises] -Get outta here. Mm. [kissy noises] [Erin giggles] [sighs] [Erin] Holy fuck! What? -Ow, shit. Your room! -[music playing on cellphone] -Is that Jenny's Instagram? -Mm-hmm. No, you don't think. I mean, I don't know, the last time she was listening to this joint was when Matt broke her heart, senior year. Maybe she's just listening to it. Probably nothing. -[Erin] Yeah, totally. -[dog snarls] No. There's no way that her and Nate broke up. [laptop chiming] -Fuck. -Fuck. [laptop chiming] Okay. [together] Hey! -Cool, cool, cool. You saw my story. -How are you? Who I gotta kill? You okay? We broke up last night, but I'm 100% fine. Like, we-- we were together for, like, nine years, right? Like, and now we're not. Anyway, Nate sucks. And he should fucking die. -[Erin] Jesus. -[Blair] What? [laughing] I'm just kidding, you guys No, I'm not. [nervous chuckle] Oh, boy. Hold onto your nips because I have some epic news. [trills] I have two words for you: Neon Classic. We haven't been to the festival in three years. It was just announced that Neon Classic is doing a pop-up show at Sony Hall, and it is going to be fucking awesome. Okay? Secret show, secret headliner. I got us three all-access passes, courtesy of the Rolling Stone. Yes, you do, bitch! You know crowds make me uncomfortable in this political climate. -Ow! That hurt. -[Jenny] Putitas! Basically, I want you to call your work and tell them you have your period and come over to my apartment. -Done. -I can't do that. I'm sorry. -Blair! -I'm sorry. I'm running point on a very important tastemakers' brunch next week, I'm presenting my Instagram strategy today, and I can't miss the hashtag roll-out. Everything you said just like... sucked. Did you mean the roll-out of the hashtag, or did you just hashtag the word roll-out? Fine. I will just come over after your meeting for lunch. -Erin, can you get some OJ for mimosas? -Yup. Oh, we also need champagne though. Because all I got is this, and it may not be here by the time you get here. [laughing] You know what I'm saying? Okay, I love you both. I love you, bye! -Bye-ee. -Love you, bye-ee! You know the beginning of a disaster movie, like, right before the girl who looks like me dies, and, like, right when the girl who looks like you walk outside and be like, "Oh, my God, look how crazy the sky looks!"? This feels like that.

Are you acting like I don't see that you're active? -What the fuck? -Right? Well, at least y'all got prospects. -What about that girl right down there? -No. [Nate] She's been looking at you all night. No, undergrad girls are lame. On OkCupid I put my stuff for forty-up.

Nice to meet you-- [Nate] Oh, I get it. That's the guy that you came here to meet originally, huh? What? No, I don't-- I don't care. I don't know-- I don't-- Psh! I do not know... who that is.

We're going to the show, okay? I leave in a week. And then I turn 30, and then I die, probably, and I... can't stop moving, or else I think about, um... [clicks tongue] I can't leave New York City like this. This is the end of an era. You, me, Blair, we've all been caught up in our own shit. I need one last epic day with my girls. We owe it to the city. Yes, queen. Trying to make me feel feelings like a motherfucking Pixar movie. -I'm not doing it. -Okay, so I'm gonna go get dressed, and you are gonna email everybody that you know that could get us on that list. All right. Uh, Jenny, I don't-- I don't know nobody. I don't... I would email you. -I don't know anybody. -Okay, new plan. We need all hands on deck. We're gonna go to Blair's office, and tell them that her mom died so she can leave. Jesus Christ! Okay, fine, her aunt. I'm afraid you don't understand what's fucked up about this suggestion, -but... -You scour Craigslist for tickets. We need more booze for today. We should get some Molly for tonight. And then we go to Neon Classic. We're gonna go mobile! And I'm gonna get dressed. [elevator bell dings] Loving this look, BT-dubs. It's like Liz Lemon fucked the Salvation Army. -Thank you. -Mm-hm. -Today, I'm free. -Yeah. We need big numbers here, okay? If they don't have an M by their name, I don't want to see them. [Erin] Ugh! She's doing that thing where she stands with her shoulders back. Good posture is so pretentious. It's like, alright, whatever, we get you. You did ballet 'til you were like in the ninth grade. At least we're gonna have to really do... She sees us. [Erin] She look pissed? Ooh... Yeah. And that would be... um... [Blair's speech continues indistinctly] Ah, fuck it. [glass rattles] Hey, Blair, can I talk to you for a sec? It's an emergency. Your aunt died. Oh, my God. Blair. Was it Aunt Camille or Aunt Denise? Oh, don't tell me, it's too devastating. I'm so sorry. If you guys could just excuse me for a moment. [voice wavers] So sorry, I'll be right back. Go. Um,  and I'm gonna pick it up on page, um... five of the presentation. So, let's talk a little bit about visual merchandising on Instagram specifically. [Blair] What are you doing here? And why did you just tell my office that my aunt died? Oh, wait... Did Aunt Camille die? AC is chillin'. Jenny, on the other hand, is in horrible shape. She needs us. Our bestie is out there drinking champagne from a bottle of green juice that still has green juice in it. [quietly] Oh, fuck. Wait, it's like a green-juice mimosa. -That's kinda genius. -She made me try it. It's fucking disgusting. I am drowning out here. I need you. She needs you. Okay, okay. Of course, yes, I'm gonna come. I just... Shit. I need to tell my office that I'm gonna... plan a funeral? -That's really fucked up. -Love you. Meet you downstairs. -I hate you. Get out of my office. -Mm-hmm. Love you, boo. Love you. [quietly] Damn it. [Jen] Why haven't we heard from the Craigslist guy yet? Hey, let's focus on the positive, okay? I am so amped for you and this new job. You're about to slay it. Aww. It's crazy, y'all. They gave me a staff of people, like... How did I convince them that I should have that much responsibility? Fuck that modesty shit. You are the dopest writer we know. -A hundred percent. -Aww. You have this really unique way of describing music that's very special. -You believe that? -Yeah. [cell phone rings] -Oh, shit. -Her pants, though. -I have to take this. I'm so sorry. -Yeah, go on. Go for Blair. -[cell phone rings] -Oh, shit. -Now my boss is... calling me. -Hey, text me when you're done. -I'm gonna go for a walk. -Okay. -[Erin] Hey, Martha. -[Jenny sighs] [Erin coughs] Yeah, I feel better. What up, doll? You get those numbers I sent you? [indistinct chatter] [Jenny] Okay. It's done. -Done? -Yep. -Alright, let's see it. -I mean, it's super rough, -and it's probably gonna be shit... -Let's see it. But it's not gonna be-- but there are mad different little... Oh! All right. Okay. [chuckles] Wow. This is really fucking good, Jen. That dude would be crazy not to hire you. Yeah. You mean that? -Yes. -Thank you. I mean, I do feel confident about it. I definitely think it's in a better spot. And he said that if he liked it, then he would start publishing me ASAP. And it's only 20 bucks a post, but fuck it, right? Because I'll... I'll be able to write about the music I wanna write about. I'll be able to introduce you to people, and this is the first step. I can freelance now, and then after I graduate, I get on staff, become an editor, and, I don't know, maybe I can run my own thing one day. You're amazing, Jen. Fucking amazing. It's insane. I mean, you know what you want to do, you're putting your all into it, and you just going forth and doing it. It's... Um... I don't know what the fuck I wanna do. -Hey! No, uh-uh. -What? No, no, no. Don't do that. Come on, you'll figure it out. Yeah, maybe. I don't know. You wanna be super corny with me real quick? -What? -Can we make this our spot? -Hell, yeah! -Hell, yeah? In fact, this is our spot. -Everybody, you, you! This is our spot! -Baby! Shh! No, fuck that. You know what? You want to know how we can do it? I should, uh... -Mark it. I'm gonna mark it down. -What? [gasps] Vandalism? Ooh, I love it when you're dangerous, baby. [Nate] Put a little happy face here. [uplifting pop music playing] [Nate] Forever! [Jenny laughs] [uplifting pop music continues] [Jenny] Hey, ladies. -[Erin] Hey, good walk? -Yeah. -Oh, Craigslist bro just texted back. -Yeah? Three VIP wristbands. -Woo! -"Come by anytime after three. No dudes." -He wrote "no dudes"? -Mm-hmm. [Jenny] Oy! Wait, he's selling them for $500? Don't worry. I got an advance from Rolling Stone for my moving, and I'm going to share -with the two of you. -Yes. I got your tickets. I got your tickets. I got it. I feel like this might be an irresponsible choice. I really want us to think about the choices we're making today, because it seems irresponsible. Says the woman who spent $400 on mink eyelashes. -I'm just saying. -These are real. -I don't believe you! -I'm gonna miss this so hard! Ah! You did not just find that in your pocket right now. I did, and I have no idea how long it's been there. That seems safe. It's fine. Blair, calm down. -Weed is like ketchup, it doesn't go bad. -Yep. Ketchup goes bad. Mm. Then you should definitely not use our ketchup. Can we at least move out of the middle of the street if we're gonna smoke weed? -Stoop, stoop, stoop! -Did you just say "we"? Does Bad Blair want to come out and play? No, Bad Blair does not want to come out and play. It is noon. Blair, please, this dooby just literally came from the heavens. This could be one of our last times ever doing this together. -Amen. -I mean, when are we gonna have this... opportunity to do this. I am alone. I got my ass broken up with. -Oh, my God. -I'm gonna leave to California. I'm not gonna see y'all. [voice cracks] I mean, really, this is a memory that you're gonna pass up? -Oh, Jesus! -Okay, yay. A memory. A memory. That was a great performance. -Thank you. -I'm sorry. These are real tears though. -Yes! -[coughing] Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Bad Blair! Blair, boo-boo. Boo, watching you take down all these carbs has been the highlight of my whole, entire life. I hate you. Both of you. Me? What I do? I didn't do nothing. [door bell jingles] How is Matt Lasher in this motherfucking restaurant right now? [Matt] Well. Oh, my God, look who it is. Jenny, wow, it's been a while. Blair, you look great. Erin! You still hate me. That's fine. So, what's up? You girls going to Neon Classic? Yes. Yes, we are. You know, my team's doing the event. You got list? It's like pretty crazy. Everyone and their mother is trying to get in. Like, my mom literally texted me. Left her unread. I actually just got a job with Rolling Stone, so I think we're good. We got like channels that we can go through. Cool, if you have any problems or something, just, you know, slide into my DMs. [Blair] Oh, good Lord. Bye. Good seeing you, Jen. What the fuck, dude? You need to get some lubricant, and slide into his motherfucking DMs. What if the Craigslist tickets fall through? What? We're fine. We're gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine. [makes popping noise] Got it. You need to fuck Matt. He's kinda the perfect rebound. It's only been a day. You need to grieve. What you need is someone to fuck the Nate out of you. Grief is an emotion best served with a side of stiff dick. -Erin... -[Jen laughs] I love you, but you've never even been in a long-term relationship. Blair. I love you, but you and Will are not exactly the second coming of Oprah and Gayle. You know what I'm saying? You need to get fucked more than she does. -Me? -Uh-huh. I fuck! [quietly] I fuck, okay? Definitely. You don't even fuck yourself. Tried to use your Rabbit the other day. That shit is dusty and the batteries are dead. That's disgusting. I feel very attacked right now. Would someone uptight give you the money to get the good Molly from the guy that lives above the McDonald's near the bridge? [both] Hype Molly? Yes, Hype Molly for us all, courtesy of your loosest friend. No. Yeah, I heard it as I said it. Top grade. [Erin] Ah. What up, you got stress-rhea? That was one time. I think it's a stretch calling an entire year of college one time. [Jenny] If anyone's gonna have stress diarrhea, it's me. Let's make this fast and get to Hype's. [Blair] I'm putting my keys in-between my fingers. Just in case this guy tries any funny business. [Erin] Yes, bitch. You shank that motherfucker with our mail key. [laughter] [shouting] Hey, yo! What up? -It's like Supreme shat out an apartment. -[man] Welcome, welcome! Come on in. [hip-hop in background] Hey, I'm Mikey, by the way, and y'all are... -Jenny, Blair, Erin. -[Mikey] Jenny, Blair. Erin, wassup? Welcome to my crib, come on in. You can smoke anything on the table that you want. Everybody always asks, "How do you afford this place?" My parents got it for me two years ago before I broke off contact with them completely. Oh, I got pasta over there, by the way, if you want some. No, we just ate a really big lunch. Blair, I mean, you can't say no to a plate. That's the spirit. Hey, what Harry Potter house are y'all? And don't lie. -I think we're all Ravenclaw. -Bitch, please. I'm Hufflepuff. -[Jenny scoffs] -Blair low-key Slytherin. Technically, I identify as a Slytherin with a Ravenclaw moon. [Mikey] Yo, that is such a Slytherin thing of you to say. I'm Gryffindor, by the way. Nobody asked, but... [laughs] [Jenny] Wait. Whoa. -This ain't what I think it is. -No, it is. [gasps] Ooh-wee! This is the ace of spades of weed, y'all. Beyoncé shmokes this weed. That is, deadass, the best weed in the game right there. I got that shit from Mike Dean's dude. I only smoke shit that rappers do. I also got some shit that will give you a seizure, so be careful. It's mild, like the flavor of the weed. The seizure's not mild, it's very strong. -[women] Oh! -Oh, my goodness, a dog! -Come back to me. Who is that? -[Mikey] Hey! [Mikey] This is... Barbra Streisand. Hey! The cutest little baby in the game. [laughs] You named your dog "Barbra Streisand"? Oh, yeah. Why would I not name him "Barbra Streisand"? She's a legend, you know? And I love female directors, for real. because I truly do believe, like, Time Is Up. As a matter of fact, Time Been Up. You know? We're late. And Lady Bird? I love that shit. I loved Lady Bird. [Mikey] You would love Lady Bird. That's so her, right? I feel like I know y'all, like... Y'all are so-- I love you guys. For real, like, y'all want something to drink? I'm drinking this expensive-ass tequila, but you gotta douse this shit in Sprite, because it low-key tastes like booty. No offense to the ass-eating community. No, thank you. Uh, we just really want the tickets. [Mikey] Right! [laughs] The tickets... Um, so... It's, like, really funny, actually. My boy, Victor, came through earlier, and I gave him the tickets, and then y'all came, and I was like, "Oh, hold up," like, "They kinda cute," like, "Let's see where this goes, maybe we can smoke a little something, drink a little something, you know, like maybe, we can fuck on each other." -[Jenny laughs] -[Mikey] Right. [Jenny laughs hysterically] [Mikey laughs] Right. -You ain't got no tickets. -Yeah, no, I ain't got the tickets. -[hysterical laughter] -[Mikey laughs] No. -Let me at him! one minute! Let me just-- -Stop! Stop! [Blair] No! No, you can't play like that, man. I got early-onset osteoporosis. Look. Look at my wrist. I ain't got no bones in my wrist, man. I was born with no bones in my left wrist. [shouting] I'm taking this, okay? I woulda gave it to you if you asked. But if you want to live your life by violence, go ahead. Weirdo! Ugh! -Yo. -Hm? I stole the Beyoncé weed, too. -Oh, Bad Blair! -She back. [Jenny] Ah, fuck it. I'm DMing Matt. [Erin] Uh-huh. And if that doesn't work, we could reach out to... What's that one dude's name... -What is this? Okay, we are... -[Jenny whimpers] [Erin] What are you doing? Hannah! Oh, shit! Nate's cousin, Hannah? Fuck! I bet you she loves that we broke up. Oh, she's always calling me, "sweetie, sweetheart." -She's coming. -No, she's not. She's-- Oh, yeah, she is. -Okay. -Erin? -[laughs] What up, girl? -Hi! What's happening? Jenny, is that you? No. Huh? What? Hannah? I have not seen you in such a long time. Girl, how have you been? That's so weird. I didn't even see you. What are you wearing? It's so 90s. So... [inhales sharply] ...chic. We're doing a piece at Vogue, and you're just, like, killing it. It's about people who don't care what they look like. Amazing. Amazing. You're, like, nailing the exact aesthetic I've been trying to convey to the photographer. Oh, my God, so funny running into you. I was just about to text Nate about when you guys are going to Neon Classic. I mean, I wasn't even gonna go, but Kim was like, "Oh, you know, you never fucking come out anymore, and Kanye wants to see you, so..." Oh, my God, shit! That was supposed to be a surprise. I'm sorry, you were saying that Nate-- -Wait. Kanye's the-- -Kanye's the secret headliner? -Shh! That's insane! -And a problematic choice. -Fix your hair so we can text Nate a pic.- We broke up, yesterday, uh, last night. And, um, yeah. It's over. Oh! [Hannah murmurs] Oh, it's okay. No, it's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. [Hannah] Mm. That's really crunchy. It's like-- Is that new denim? You know, if you need anything from me, just do not hesitate to contact my assistant. Text is better. You'll get me faster. Thank you. Be well. It's so good to see you. -Okay, take care. -[Blair] Be well. Uh... J-Bug. [cell phone pings] She was saying something about Nate and Neon Classic. You wanna, like, talk about that? Bam! Matt got us three wristbands. What you know about that? And a tongue emoji. He sucks. And what Hannah said, I... I don't even know what she's talking about. But who cares, right? Who cares about Nate? The only thing that matters is us living our best life, right? Living our best life. So, onto pressing matters, who wants to go to booty-hole Brooklyn to get these wristbands? -I will rock-paper-scissors-- -I can do it. -You're a really good friend. -[Blair chuckles] -And I love you, dude. -I love you. Hey, Blair. I really do find it a bit tedious that you just couldn't put us on the list for these wristbands. [Matt] I hate to break it to you, but there's no list. That's not true. There's always a list. So, you decided to come alone? Nobody else wanted to come to this weird office. What do you even do here, Matt? Literally nothing. [Blair] Hm. You look really good. No. Don't do that. Oh, come on, you wouldn't even be here if you didn't want me to, you know... do that. Does Jenny know about us? There is nothing to know. Funny. [softly] Not how I remember it. I remember... a drunken night like... When was it? Two years ago? That I... [whispering] ...honestly have not been able to stop thinking about since. You looked so incredible in those tights. -[Blair breathes heavily] -They were so easy to rip off. [Blair pants] Lock the door. This means nothing. Whatever you say. [gasps] We shouldn't. We shou-- I mean, if you really want me to stop, I'll stop. [sighs] Don't stop. [knocking on door] Coming, my darlings! Coming! -Hi! -Hi! -Come in. -[Jenny] Woo-woo! [Erin] Wassup! Ah! I just got out of the shower, so don't mind me. -You smell delicious. It's been so long. -Well, you never call me! I mean, what, you don't do drugs anymore or what? We can't afford your shit. You know that already. -[Hype] Please. -You got diamonds on your weed. Child, you know I love and miss you. -You messy bitch! -[giggles] [Hype] Now, don't tap, don't tap, baby. That makes 'em real mad. Oh! Are these baby sharks? [Hype] Yes, they're baby sharks! Yes, they're so tiny! I feel like they're my children. I got 'em illegally, so don't tell nobody. -Okay? -[Erin] Nobody to tell. Acting like anybody's gonna care if they come up here with all your drogas. Come on, now. Baby sharks is the least of your worries. [Jenny gasps] Hey, princesas! -What? -Uh-huh. They just do this for you. [Hype] Yeah, they stay perched. -So you going to the big show tonight? -You know it. Lotta people been through here today. I'm sure. Neon Classic! What's with this outfit? I mean, you look crazy, but at the same time, you look real sexy. -Ow! -Yeah, you look good. I love it. Your girl is having a day. Can you just not? Can we not do that? Not right now. -Nate broke up with her last night. -No! Girl! Oh, my God, he's so hot. Aw, baby. Are you devastated? Girl, 'cause I would be devastated. I'm okay. No, you're not. I can see the sadness in your eyes. You know what? -[Erin] Shit! -[Jenny] Oh, my goodness! -Jesus! -I thought you pulled out another puppy. -Oh, my goodness. Look at this. -[Hype laughs] Ah! It's the holy grail of joints. How? How do you even roll something like this? -Well, it takes a strong will. -Mm. -And three papers, baby. -[Erin] Oh. Now, that's happy medicine right there, girl. -Yes! -[Jenny] Oh, Lord have mercy. [Hype] Yes. -Yeah, baby, this pimp shit easy. -[Erin giggles] Just exhale. Let it all go away and think about happy times. [Jen] Oh, you wanna order Chinese? [Nate] That sounds like a good idea. You're smart. -Oh! Why, thank you, baby. -[Nate laughs] Let me see, let me see. Gimme all the food. All the food. Mixed vegetable with bean curd. What is bean curd? -I just want to know. -[chuckles] Like, I need to know what it is. Okay. ¿Que tu quiere, papa? Dime-lo. [speaking Spanish] [speaking English] Practice that Spanish of yours. What? I love you. -I... -[stuttering] I was just... That was stupid. -[Jen] No. -I shouldn't have said that, no. -I don't love you. -What? I do-- I do love you. I don't love... Ah, shit. No, that was amazing, and I... and... And that was amazing, and you are really... and I just don't know... um... what to say back. No, that's cool. It's all right. It's okay. I mean... Yeah. Aw, I fucked it up, didn't I? [Nate] No, baby, no, it's fine. Like, I'm... Well, is it okay? Is that okay? -Yeah, it's totally fine, yeah. -You're doing the funny dance. [chuckles nervously] I'm just-- I gotta... pee. And take a shower, 'cause I smell like... [affects fake Asian accent] Kung Pao chicken. Chinese! Woo! [Nate snaps fingers] It's fine, baby. [quietly] It's fine. Hm. [whispers] Why didn't I just say it! Why didn't I just say it! [shower water running] [sound of shower gets louder] [Nate] Come here, girl. Oh, you wanna play kitty-cat, don't you? I can play that. Say, uh, what are you doing later, baby? -I love you! -[Nate shouts] -Oh, shit! -Ahh! -Oh, no, close your eyes! Close 'em! -Ahh! What are you doing? [Jenny laughing] Ah It burns! It burns! Come here. I need to-- I need to find you. You stupid ass. Get in the nose! Don't get in the nose. [laughs] I love you. I like saying it. I love you. -I lurve you. -I love you too, baby. I love ya, baby. I love you so much, baby. I love you. -I'll never put you in harm's way. -[squeals] -[both laugh] -[Jen squeals] [sighing] Can I use your bathroom? Gimme the joint first. -Oh, you right. -It's the door on the left down there. All right. [Hype] So what you gonna do? Because I can feel so much love in your eyes. Girl, this just can't be where it ends. Trust and believe. I'm also clairvoyant. Ain't that ghosts? [chuckling] It's everything. And I know, I know in my heart of hearts that you want your man back. So, girl, you gon' go get your man. Aight, homie, we gotta go get these Neon Classic outfits. Okay. [in formal voice] I would like three of your finest Hype Mollys, please. How much? Forty. And one free for sad Jenny. -Yay. -[Erin] Hey. -Prizes for being sad. -[Hype] Hm. Oh, thank you, Hype. Thanks, Hype. [Jenny] Erin! I wanna go to Leah's store. -[Matt] That was good. -That was not good. I have a boyfriend, and my best friend used to like you. Yeah, in college. Oh, come on, Blair. You can't possibly be using the friend thing on me right now. Jenny hates me. Yeah, she hates you, which means the feelings might still be there. Should I give her a call? Oh, my God. I'm kidding! Oh, my God, Blair, you seem like you would be a total nightmare to date, but I'm head-over-heels for your fucking crazy mind. Take these. -I have no idea how to respond to that. -It was a compliment. -Don't think that was. -Well, it was. Don't smile at me. You have a very... very nice smile and it makes me feel fucking confused. -All right. See you later, Blair. -Fuck you. Oh, uh, one more thing. Those wristbands are just GA. I couldn't really swing anymore VIP, but... I put you guys on the list for the party. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm afraid not. That was not GA intercourse. [chuckles] You're the woman of my dreams. Bye, Blair. [quietly] Oh, my God. [sighs] ["Should I" playing] Why are you spinning out right now? Me? [scoffs] I'm not. This is great. I'm happy to see her. It's fine, you know? Hey. I didn't think I'd see you today. Leah, 911, an emergency. I just need my whole shit fixed. Breakup discount. Thirty off the whole store. Go nuts. Oh, oh, oh! [Erin] No sweatpants, bitch. I like that you're wearing my shirt. You know, it's a good shirt. You know, in keeping with my promise from this morning, you still owe me an answer.

Erin. -Can you help me in the dressing room? -Yes. Yes I can, girl. Mm-hmm. I gotta go. -You gotta go? -Help her in the dressing room. [Leah] Okay, great. I bet you do. Jesus. What, are you gonna try on the whole store? -Ow! Ow! The double? -The double. You deserve that. What are you doing out there? Why are you being weird with Leah? I dunno.

[sighs] [sighs] [Nate] That was embarrassing. [Jen] You screaming at me in front of an entire party was embarrassing for you? I wasn't even looking at my phone that much. Literally, every time I turned around and looked up, you were looking down. [Jenny] Am I supposed to ignore my editor? [Nate] I'm trying to get you to meet the people I work with, and the whole time -you looking at your phone. -Do you think I like being the shitty, fucking downer girlfriend? -Fuck it, let's go home. -No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to go home. I want to go out. I'm fun, okay? Let's go back to the party. I want to talk to everybody. I want to be exactly what you want, Nate. I could be 20-year-old Jenny again with no responsibilities. Then maybe you'll still love me, huh? Don't fucking laugh at me! Fuck you! Since when do you give a shit about the people you work with? You gonna get all close to these new fucking worker friends? [Nate] Don't change the subject. You tell me I don't love you when you're the one moving across country. [Jen] If you can't make that work, what does that say about us? Wow, you turn it around on me. I did not turn this around on you! You attacked me! -I attacked you? -Yes, you fucking did. Why do you keep saying "fucking" to me? -Fuck! -Fuck! -Fuck! -Fuck! -Fuck! -Fuck you, Nate! See, your insecurities are manifesting themselves in a really ugly way right now. This isn't working. [Nate] See, you need some sleep. -No, don't do that shit. -That's what you need. I'm not doing shit. I am a grown-ass woman, all right? I don't need you. Yeah, you never do. You never fucking do.

I mean, it's kind of the pot telling the kettle to grow up, but... I don't know, never mind. [laughs sarcastically] Yeah, okay. I am not the pot. -Oh, really? -Mm. You're late to work every day. Not every day. You go out on work days more than you go out on weekends. Because it's bridge and tunnel. Erin, you're holding onto something that is gone. Do you think you're gonna be young forever? We're almost 30 years old. It's not cute anymore. Don't you have personal goals? Do you have a plan for the future? How did your plan work out? Oh, right. It was completely fucking insane and backfired. It did not backfire. We can't fuck around anymore. I want a best friend that gets up with me on Saturdays to go to the farmers' market. And you sleep through the farmers' market every weekend. Is that what being an adult means to you? Going to the fucking farmers' market. -What else? Tell me your ways. -Admitting that you like Leah, and you want to be in a relationship with her. What are you so afraid of? Everything! If I grow up, it means I need to change everything. Everything's already fucking changing, Blair. Jenny's leaving. And actually, the farmers' market sounds really, really like... assuring and coddling and comforting right now. Like, is there one tomorrow? -Great fresh produce. -Yeah. All I feel right now is, like, just love for you coursing through my veins, and I just want to hug it out. Me too. I just want to hug you. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. [Blair] I'm so sorry. I love you. [Erin murmurs] -[Blair laughs] Say it back! -[laughs] I love you. [cell phone pings] [Blair] Oh, shit. She's with Matt. -Oh. -I have an address. -Hoo! -Yeah. -We're back. -[clicks tongue] All right. I gotta make a pit stop. Okay. -[Blair] Woo! -["Missing U" playing] ♪ Now that it's over ♪ ♪ The space where you used to be ♪ ♪ Your head on my shoulder ♪ [hum of chatter] ♪ All of the plans we made That never... ♪ Oh, shit dicks. Shit. Here, here, here. Let me help you. Let me get-- Nope, no, no. No, no. Big girl, grownup here. I'm sorry! You know this is all your fault. Oh, yeah? Enlighten me. Well, if you had just dated me in college, I would never have met Nate. And I wouldn't be completely heartbroken. I was dumb in college. You know I fucked several different women that stole from me? Oh, wow! I was so obsessed with you in college. I spent so much time thinking about you and crying over you and... It just makes me realize that what I felt for you wasn't even real because it definitely didn't feel like this. [Matt] Come on. You're looking at it all wrong. You've been blessed with a broken heart. When it doesn't hurt anymore, that's when it's really over. Live in this as long as you can. I gotta go. Really? Tell Erin and Blair that I am going to finish it. -And they'll know what I mean. -What are you talking about? That makes no sense. Oh, right. You're-- You're on drugs. I... forgot, you're on drugs. Are you cool? You okay? -I'm gonna be okay. -All right. Hey, Young! I'm sorry I was such an asshole in college. Don't be. You helped me find Nate. [doorbell rings] [Leah gasps] Hi. -[Blair] Hi! -Hey! Hi! -Leah! -What's up? -Hi! -[Leah] You okay? -Yeah. -Shit, you're rich. Everything's great. I just need to, like, talk to you right now. She wants to go to the farmers' market with you. -[Blair groans] -Right now? No, like... Like, normal farmers' market... -Functioning hours. -Yeah. -It's real. -Mm-hmm. -You're so pretty. -Don't touch her. -Thank you. -Oh, my God, her skin. Okay, boo. Yeah. How you feeling? You still... -Yeah. Oh, my God. -Yeah. -I feel like it's gotten more intense. -I can see that. -Yeah. -Yeah. So I'm going to play you some really great music. Okay? You just let it, like, wash over you, all right? Just let it, like, move you wherever you want to go, okay? And whatever you do, do not take the headphones out until I tell you to. -Great. -[shudders in pleasure] [shouting] I can feel the seasons changing! [shouting] Yeah. Perfect. You got it, girl. Woo! All right. Let's have a... Yeah... Seat... Sit... Seat... [Erin laughs nervously] -Are you rolling? -I am, I am definitely rolling. But that has nothing to do with the words that are about to come out of my face right now. -Understood. -Yeah, great. Okay. Mm. [metallic clang] [chuckles] Alright, give me a minute. [laughs nervously] I... think I lo... Hmm. Why is this so hard? Because you've never said it before. Is that bad? No. When I was in college, I thought I'd... You get it. [both laugh] With this, uh, one girl, and she was great. You know, everything was great. It was fun. She was smart. Whatever. And our relationship was... beautiful. And, out of nowhere, she just like... went back to men. And it fucking crushed me. I felt like... I was just some experiment. And I've never told anyone that. [sniffles] -Not Jenny, who's my fucking bestie. -Mm. -Or that crazy bitch back there. -[both laugh] I know what that feels like. -Really? -Mm-hmm. See, I've never had someone to share this part of myself with. Woo! I'm feeling, like, so many things right now, like, so many things. [laughs] Yeah. You have two straight best friends. I have to imagine you're not sitting around reading queer theory together. You know, I'm good with taking it slow. -You sure? -Mm-hmm. I am terrified of meeting your friends. Like, what if they don't like me? Bitch, everybody likes you. Yeah, you right. -Oh, wow. Okay, okay. -You right. [both laugh] [Erin sniffles] -I think I-- -I think I love you, too. -[Leah laughs] -[Erin quivers] [Jenny] Do you think I can have one more kiss? I'll find closure on your lips, and then I'll go. Maybe also one more breakfast, one more lunch, and one more dinner. I'll be full and happy and we can part. But in between meals, maybe we can lie in bed one more time. One more prolonged moment where time suspends indefinitely as I rest my head on your chest. My hope is if we add up the "one mores," they will equal a lifetime, and I'll never have to get to the part where I let you go. [laughing] Yes, baby! Baby, wait. Grip on. Grip on tight. -We're okay. Go, go, go, go. -No. Fuck this. Actually, you owe my ass a... Okay, fine. Let's do it. Oh! Shit! [laughing] You're a dick! [Jenny] But that's not real, is it? There are no more "one mores." I met you when everything was new and exciting, and the possibilities of the world seemed endless. And they still are. For you, for me. But not for us. Somewhere between then and now, here and there, I guess we didn't just grow apart, we grew up. When something breaks, if the pieces are large enough, you can fix it. Unfortunately, sometimes things don't break, they shatter. But when you let the light in, shattered glass will glitter. And in those moments, when the pieces of what we were catch the sun, I'll remember just how beautiful it was. Just how beautiful it'll always be. Because it was us. And we were magic. -Forever. -[Nate shouts] Forever! [Jenny laughs] All right, divide and conquer. -I'll take this room, you take that one. -Yup-yup! Blair! God, you're so fucking sexy. Oh, she cute. All right. ["Do You Think About Me" playing] ♪ Do you think of me? ♪ Where the fuck is this bitch? [huffs] [Matt grunting] [Matt grunting] [Erin gasps] Holy fuck! [laughs] Wow, uh... Wow. Uh, Blair Bear? Girl, I just want you to know that I am just as proud of you right now as I am deeply disturbed by what I just saw. [shouting] But I stand by you! And your risque choices, and I will meet you outside. Don't forget to wash your hands. You fuck, boo. You fuck. [Blair] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Can you please get out of me now? Yeah, sorry. I just sorta froze up. [Blair] Ahem. Hello. Oh, hey, what's up? -Hi. -Feeling relaxed? Shut up. Anything you care to share with the class? It was only the second time. Oh, my God. Today. -You did it at his office? -I needed to get the wristbands. We needed to get the wristbands. I don't even fucking know who you are right now. Like in a bad way? In the best way. You out here. Living your best life, just making choices. -Yes. -Taking risks. -Yes. -Yes. Feels good. It should. Do you think Jenny's gonna be mad at me? No. Why would she be mad at you? She loves you. Yeah. Did we ever find out where she went? No. Tiny Ethan... said she said something to Matt about, like... going out and finishing it, and then she, like, stalked off. -So ominous. -Bitch is dramatic, we know this. -"Finish it"? -Yup. I have no idea. It has to do something with Nate. Where would she go to finish the relationship? Oh, my God, yep. Know where she's at. Let's go. Oh, God. God.

I know I said we got to be our own people, but... Shit, I'm not even a person without you. Maybe this whole thing implodes, nothing works, but at least we try. -[Blair] Hey. -[Erin] Jenny! Jenny baby! Your ass is all the way out. -[Blair] Hey. -[Erin] Jen. Jenny. -Hey. -[Jenny] What? Oh, my God. We were so fucking worried, dude. Oh, my God. I'm so stupid. Yeah, Washington Square Park? Like, how the fuck did you not get robbed? [sighs] [Erin] You okay? [quietly] I'm sad. I'm just so sad. Oh, but it's like the good sad, you know? I, uh... We loved each other. We love-- We... We love each other. I mean, 'cause that shit doesn't go away, right? -No. -It's, uh... [breathing deeply] Wasn't just San Francisco. We were all sorts of fucked up. I think about... us and him and New York City and... how I thought if I could just keep everything the same then nothing would change, but... Everything's changing. [Blair] Did you get to talk to him? No, I couldn't. I mean, I couldn't... [sighs] I saw him, but I don't know, I... I guess, um... Shit, I guess in that moment, I was choosing myself. [Erin chuckles] 'Cause it's like, it's not, um... our journey anymore. It's mine. Fuck. Oh, fuck, that's so weird. That's so fucking weird. -But kind of amazing, right? -[Jenny] Yeah. [sighing] I am so scared to be without you two. I don't know life without this. We're scared too, okay? But this isn't gonna change. We'll still be doing this. Living in different cities won't change that. Aight? We'll still be FaceTiming -every morning. -Right when I hit that pooper. While you're on the motherfucking toilet. -No. -Why don't you ever join in that? -I'm not gonna do that. -It's a phenomenal activity. I don't wanna see either of you shit. [laughs] I'm sorry. I love you both, but no. I'm just like this. [whimpers] [laughing] I'm really glad you guys pulled me out of work today. -You are? -Today was amazing. [Erin] It was epic. An update. I caught this bitch, on the sink, having sex... with Matt. Girl! -Girl? -[Erin laughs] At the after-party. But I also might have slept with him when I went to get the wristbands. I'm sorry. -Was it good? -Yes. Yes, it was so good, and that's the best-- worst part. Are you mad? Are you kidding? [impersonates dance music] Thrusting, thrusting. You guys are coochie-cousins! [screaming, laughing] -I'm kinda jealous. -[Jenny] You should be. Oh! Also, update. Before we went to the after-party, we stopped by Leah's place. Y'all did so much. -It was a lot of time. -And Erin... basically Say Anything'd her. -Boombox? -No boombox. But... we did say "I love you." -[Jenny] Oh, that's my boo. -Yes. -You did that? -You guys... [Blair] I'm so proud of us. Oh, so much. -Yeah. -Ah. So good. -So grown. -Yeah, real grown. There was a point, many points-- tonight was long-- where I was like, "All I want to do is go to Leah's and watch that murder doc on Netflix." Okay, so you have to go online afterwards and get the articles, because there's so much they don't tell you in the series. -Yeah, you said that before. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the real deal. Okay. That girl is 12. We need to go. -She's a baby. -It's too much. We did it. -[Jenny] Yep, it's done. -[Blair] You're good. We done did it. We done did it, y'all. [Blair laughs] We did.

[Jenny] Where did this rain come from, though? -It's super aggressive, it's strange. -[Blair] Kinda like our night. [Jenny] I feel like I gotta stop. I gotta just keep facing outwards. -[Erin] I think I got gum in my purse. -[Blair] Can we get tacos? [together] Yeah!
