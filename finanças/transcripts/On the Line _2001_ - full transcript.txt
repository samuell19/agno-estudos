IT ALL STARTED BECAUSE OF A GIRL AT A PARTY. SPRING, 1994. THAT WAS OUR BAND-- GRANITE. WE WERE ALL ABOUT THE ROCK. I MEAN, WE WERE HARDCORE. GRANITE! GRANITE! GRANITE! GRANITE! AND THIS WAS THE MOMENT. MY BIG CHANCE TO IMPRESS THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS. KEV, I GOT A GREAT IDEA. WHAT? WHY DON'T WE JUST SING THE BALLAD THAT I WROTE, DEDICATE IT TO HER, AND THEN WHEN IT'S OVER, JUST ASK HER OUT. COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU, STUPID? SHE'S RIGHT THERE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THE BALLAD. I CAN DO THIS. GRANITE! YEAH, KEVIN, YOU CAN DO IT. COME ON, KEVIN. DON'T BE SUCH A WUSS. COME ON, JUST DO IT. I DIDN'T DO IT. I JUST FROZE. COME ON, KEVIN, DON'T BE A TULIP! MY HEART STARTED POUNDING. MY PITS STARTED SWEATING. AW... I FELT NAKED UP THERE. KEVIN. KEVIN. KEVIN! WHAT IS IT? I CAN'T BELIEVE IT, MAN. THAT STORY GETS FUNNIER EVERY TIME I HEAR IT. YEAH. THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT. MAN, COME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS? I THINK IT'S A LACK OF SELF-CONFIDENCE. I MEAN, I KNOW YOU GO OUT ON DATES AND EVERYTHING, BUT I THINK WHEN YOU FIND THE GIRL OF YOUR DREAMS, YOU CAN'T SEAL THE DEAL, YOU KNOW? PICK THE FRUIT, SPIT THE WAD. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? NO, I DON'T. I THINK WHAT YOUR FRIEND IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM A CLASSIC PSYCHOSOMATIC COMMUNICATIVE ANXIETY DISORDER. BASICALLY, YOU MEET THE RIGHT GIRL, YOU CHOKE. THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING. DUDE, YOU GOT TO RELAX. WATCH ME WORK. FRENCH FRY? FKR. HOW CAN I DIRECT YOUR CALL? HOLD, PLEASE. YEAH. HAVE IT UNDER CONTROL? GOOD MORNING, MARGIE. FKR.

WELL, WHAT HAPPENED? SHE BLEW ME OFF. OH, MAN! THAT IS BAD! YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME, THOUGH.
