- Jake, stop. Jake, it's too early. Go back to bed. Oh, no. How could you let me do this, huh? I'm only gonna be gone for a few days, okay? And please don't take yourself on any walks this time. Okay, four games in seven days. You know how the minor leagues are. Here we go. What? I'll be back in a week. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah, yeah. I overslept. Oh. Jake, Ryles is gonna take care of you. You better be good. - Hey, quality time, Jakey boy. Ben, what are you doing? - I'm Jake-proofing. Now, remember, keep making those wishes for us, all right? I need a double play every game. A couple home runs won't hurt. Then they got to give us a call. We're back in the show, huh? Okay, I'll be back in a week. Be a good boy. Stay. Thanks. All right, see you later, buddy. - Mom, why do we have to move, anyway? - I got a great new job at the university. Is it to the left or to the right? - Melissa's mom is taking her and Amy to a movie. She wishes I could go. She wishes I wasn't a thousand miles away. - Oh, honey. It says to the left. - Mom, look at that poor dog. It looks so lost. We have to help him. - Honey, he looks like a stray. - This is our new street. I bet there's lots of kids in the neighborhood. See, it's not so bad. You'll make lots of new friends. Isn't it cute? It's perfect for us. Come on, let's go tell them where to put everything, or else we'll be living in a mess for weeks. - I liked our old house better. - I've got to get through all the boxes in the front room. Oh, and I've got to get the pictures hung. But then this afternoon, we'll take a break. We'll go to the community pool for a swim. I'm sure there'll be neighborhood kids there, and you'll get to make some new friends. - Sure. Where are all the kids, mom? - Oh. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I'll swim anyway. - Hi. I'm Megan Nolan. We just moved in. - Welcome. I'm Gail Warner. - Um, do you know where all the kids are? - The families in the newer homes all have kids who are newly hatched, and the people in the older homes... They're empty nesters. - Yeah, I figured if we got here at the start of summer, she'd make some friends by the time school started. - Murphy's law. - Honey, you still gonna swim? - In a minute. Is your dog friendly? - Teddy? Yeah, he's friendly. - Can I pet him? - Of course. Do you have a dog? - No. - This is very kind of you. I should be finishing unpacking, but... - Have you unpacked your kitchen stuff yet? - Uh, I can't even find half of it. I can make cereal and sandwiches, but... - Exactly. When do you start your new job? - Uh, not officially until after labor day. I'm a professor at the university. - Cool! But sit down and relax. We have all summer to finish unpacking. - Sit. - Oh, sweetie. Tell him, "Teddy drop," then "Teddy sit," then throw it to him. - Sit. - Go get it. - He's well trained. - That's how I like them. - Hey, Jakey! Look what I got. Jakey boy. Jake! Jake! Oh, no. Jake! Jake! Oh, no. - Go on. Get! - Jake! Jake! Jake! - Done. - Honey. Sweetheart. - I don't want to be here. I want to go home. - Honey, I know how hard this is for you. I promise you will meet friends quickly. Okay? - Jake! Jake! Jake! Hey, hey! Come here, buddy! Come here! Here! - Come on, you're okay. Here you go! Okay, good boy. Come on. Come on. With me, come on. - Jake! Jake! - Safe! - Jake! Jake! Jake! It's Ryles. You know what to do. - Hey, Ryles. What going on? It's me. Just, uh, calling to check in, see how you and Jake are doing. Uh, give him a big hug for me. Talk to you soon. - All right, here you go, boy. It's okay. There you go. Okay. Come on. Good boy. Come on. There you go. - Aw, cute dog! - Hey! Hi! - Hey! - How are you? - Good. How are you? - Hey, Ryles. What's up? Hey, buddy. - What's up, Jake? Where's Jake? Jake! Jake! Jakey! Oh. You checked Jackson field, right? - Yes. - Okay, uh... How about the high school? - Yeah. Of course. - Um, the...The elementary school baseball field? - Yes, and I checked the football field. I looked everywhere that you take him. - Jakey! - Caity, come on, we're going somewhere. - Where? - It's a surprise. - Tell me. - Well, if I tell you, it won't be a surprise anymore. - Mom. - You obviously called the pound that I got him from, right? - Yeah. I told you, twice a day. - Okay. What about the veterinarians? Anybody bring in an injured dog? - Look, I called every dog doctor in town. I've looked everywhere. - Where are you, buddy? Well, what about the pound in Ashton? - That's eight miles away. He wouldn't have gone that far. - The pound is eight miles away, but the city limit is only a half a mile away. What if they picked him up on the other side? Oh, boy. I'm gonna check the pound in Ashton. - Are your eye still closed? - Yes. - Okay. Keep them closed. Are they still closed? - Yes. - Okay, no peeking when we get out. Okay. Keep them closed. Open them. - A dog? We're getting a dog? - A little dog... A rescue dog from the animal shelter that someone else has trained already. - Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you! - He's cute! Do you like those? Or that one in there? Oh! What about this one? - Too small and too yappy. - But he's a miniature poodle. And poodles don't shed. - I'll know my dog when I see him. - Can we please see this one? See? Isn't he exactly what you wanted? - He's perfect! It's him. It's the dog you nearly ran over. - How do you know? - I remember him. Isn't he the most beautiful dog you've ever seen? - Caity, look at him. He's filthy. - We can give him a doggie bath. - Is he properly trained? - Who knows? He's a stray. - See, honey, we don't know anything about him. We should keep looking. - Mom, no. He's the one. He's my dog. - No, I'm sorry. Absolutely not. - There you go. He's all yours. You won't be sorry. He's a prince of a dog. - Prince! That's what I'm gonna call him. Come on, prince. Heel, prince, heel. - Here, let me take him. - I can do it. - No. - Heel. - Here. Prince, heel. Here, open the door. Heel! Okay, go in. - No. Not sit. In. - Prince, go in. Come on. - Don't be mean to him. - Prince, please go in. Okay. Um, go around to the other side of the door and call his name. - Okay. - Okay. Prince, come on. Come on. Go in. - Here, prince, here. - Go in. - Here, prince. Here. See? Okay. Put your seat belt on. Hey, you! You blocked me in. - You got plenty of room. Excuse me, guys. Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Good night. - Hey. - Hey, how was your trip? - Oh, it was great. Thanks. Have a good weekend. - You too. Jakey! Jake! - Can I help you? - Have you seen this guy? - No. I haven't seen him. But I've been on vacation the last two weeks. Have a look around. Thanks. - Jake! Jakey! Jake! Jake! Hey. - Hey. No luck? - No. Can I put this up here? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Prince wins! Prince gets the gold medal! - Bravo, prince. Good job. - Hey. I totally struck out. - So what are we gonna do? You want me to stay here and watch a game with you? No. - Hey, you want to come down to the high school with me and see how the summer-league team does? It's one of coach Thomas' last games... Only a few more before he retires. Come on, it will take your mind off of things. - No, I'm gonna wait here just... You know, in case he comes back. Wherever he is, he's got to be sad and lonely and just... Trying to find his way home. - Caitlin, having a dog is a big responsibility. Seeing that prince is your dog, it's your job to train him. - Now, remember how I told you to train Teddy, right? First, you say his name to get his attention. Then you give him his command, and then you give him his reward. - Do I give him a treat? - It's best to just give him a load of love. Like, watch this. Prince, sit. Sit. Prince, sit. Good. Prince, stay. Oh! - Oh, no! - Prince! - Oh! - Prince! - No. Prince. - Oh, prin... - Oh, grab the... No! Bad dog! He's running the other way! Hurry! - Oh, no! - We got to catch him! - Prince! - No! Bad dog! - Heel! Heel! Heel! - Prince, heel. - Prince! Prince. - It's okay. He didn't mean to. It's okay. It's okay. - Oh. Good night, my little angel. Sweet dreams. And you, devil dog... You shouldn't be on the bed. Get off. - Okay. Just this once. No! Sit! Stay! Don't look at me that way. Aah! Get off! Get off! Get off my bed! Off, now, off! Go! Prince is a disaster waiting to happen. - You said we could have a dog. - I said we could have a dog. - He'll get better, I promise. - He is not the right dog for us. - He's the right dog for me. - Hey. - Hey. How was the weekend? - It was quiet. - Good. - Have a good one. - You too. Hey. Oh, no. - Caity, will you put him in the kitchen, please? - Sure. Come on, prince. - You! - Do I know you? - We met on Friday outside the animal shelter. What do you want? - I'm looking for my dog. - I don't have your dog. - Uh, yeah. You adopted my dog. Jake? Jake! Jake, come here. Hey. Oh, I've been looking everywhere for you. Where did you go? Why did you run away, buddy? Oh, it's so good to see you. Oh, how have you been? They been taking good care of you, buddy? What is this? You see? We have a problem, don't we? - Caitlin, can you please take him to the backyard, so mister... - Ben Fuller. - So Mr. Fuller and I can talk? - There is no way that I'm leaving without my dog. - Okay, look, that dog of yours is a completely untrained monster, but my daughter has fallen in love with him. So, if you just give me a few days, I think I can talk her down. - I'm gonna let Jakey stay there for a couple of days, okay? You don't get it. It's an impossible situation. - You seriously just left him there. Please tell me she's hot. She is not hot. Okay. She is hot, but that's not the point. - Yes, it is. You just let her steal your dog. If she's not hot, what other excuse do you have? - I did not let her steal Jake, okay? You did not see that little girl. She was heartbroken. - Buddy, uh, next to baseball, Jake is your whole life. You do everything together. I mean, you even don't date women unless he likes them. - She's trying to talk her daughter into letting him go. She said she'd call. - Right. How many women have you told that to? - She legally owns him now. - But what was she going to do, call the cops? I mean, she was just trying to get you out of there without a fight. She totally played you, dude. - You know how you feel about prince? - I love him. - And you've only had him for a weekend. Imagine how poor Mr. Fuller must feel since he's had him since he was a puppy. - I thought you didn't like him. - Well, I don't. But it doesn't mean I can't imagine how he feels. And imagine how prince must feel. You know how you've missed your old friends from school? Well, don't you think that prince feels the same way? - He's happy. Look at him. - We've got to think about what's best for prince. - I'm good for him. - We can get you another puppy, Caitlin. And I promise, in a day or two, you'll love him the same way you love prince. Will you put him in the back? - Okay. - What are you doing here? I thought we agreed that I'd call you. - Look... There's an adoption at Petsmart this weekend, okay? All of these dogs are looking for homes. I'll pay any expenses that are involved. Your daughter can have any one of these adorable dogs. - I don't want another dog. - You couldn't wait another day. - Please. - If we let you have prince, can I see him sometimes? - Yeah. Yeah, I take him to the d park all the time. You can meet us there. - Honey, I do think that this is the best decision for everybody, especially prince. But are you sure? - I love him. And he's been with you longest. He'll miss you most. - You are being very grown-up right now. And I'm very proud of you. - Thank you. - He's in the backyard. Do you want to go and get him? - Yeah. - Ugh! I got to get this. - Did you miss me, buddy? Okay. I miss you too. Oh, good boy. Thanks for taking such good care of him. He's a great dog, isn't he? - He's my best friend. - Have you ever had another dog? - My friend Amy does. - Yeah? Did you take Jakey to go meet her dog? - No. She lives where we used to live. - Oh, so you just moved here. You know, when I first got drafted into pro ball, I was like, "whoo, I made it, finally," you know? It's all peaches and cream from here. Then I got traded to another team and then another team. I had to leave all my friends behind and... But then I realized, it's actually kind of fun... Finding new stuff to do and meeting new friends. - Jake is the only friend I've got. - You know... I don't want to take him away from you. - We can't both have him. - Well, we could share him. You know, when I'm on a road trip, he can stay with you, when I'm home, he can stay with me. - Oh, there you two are. - Can we, please? - Can we what? - Share prince. He'll be with us half the time and with Ben half the time. - That's a... Fair idea. - When do you go away again? - Well, not till the end of next week. But you want to watch him this week anyway? - Can I? - Yeah, sure. - And what happens when the season's over and you're not going on road trips anymore? - Dude, I don't know. We'll just cross that bridge when we come to it. I mean, Caitlin's got to have started her new school by then. She's bound to have made some human friends, right? - And this shared custody of your dog... That was what, the mother's brilliant idea? - No. It was my idea, okay? I couldn't hurt Caitlin. At least now I don't have to worry about Jake taking himself on walks while I'm away. - I can't believe I let it happen. I mean, one minute, I'm talking her into giving up prince... Or Jake... Whatever his name is... Completely. And the next minute, I've been suckered into dog-sitting him whenever Mr. Ben Fuller feels like it. He said he's a professional baseball player. - Ooh, that sounds cool. - Yeah, he's one of those guys who refuses to grow up and always gets his own way. - How do you know? You just met him. - I know the type. Can you imagine his house with that dog running riot all the time? - Oh, come on, all men are slobs. - Yeah, maybe. That's why when it's our turn to drop him off, we're doing it at the dog park. - He's cute. Hmm, so is his buddy. - Say good-bye to him. - Good-bye, Jakey. You be good. I'll see you soon. - Okay. Come on. - I wasn't sure you'd come. - I keep my word. - Oh, oh! Hey, Jake! - Oh! - Oh! - Stop! - Jake! - Oh. - Good hustle, Jimmy. - There you go. All right. Good job. - All right, let's give it up for big Ben Fuller. Come on, guys. So, big Ben, how many years have you been playing pro ball? - Oh, man, more years than I care to think about. - Okay, kids, let's hit it. - Hey, good luck in the playoffs, huh? - Thanks, Mr. Fuller. - Good luck this year, Mr. Fuller. - Hey, you're a good coach. - Come on, I'm just passing on what you taught me. - So, um, you given any thought as to what you might do when you...You're finished playing pro ball? - Well, not yet. You know, I got a lot of good years of playing left in me. - Yeah, I see. You know, you're coming to my retirement party, right? - No way. Yeah, of course I am. - Yeah, they still haven't found someone to replace me. They asked Tommy Turner. The guy turned them down flat. He said he was too old to lead the junior high. - Yeah. Well, good luck with that. They're not gonna find anybody to replace you, coach. Yeah, yeah. Don't you have a game tonight? - Oh, man. Oh, I got to go. I'm late. Thanks. See you soon. - Hey, thank you. - Anytime. - Am I interrupting? - No. A break would be a relief. - Uh-huh. You know it's against pool rules to bring work up here, right? I mean, there's a sign over there. - It's compulsory reading for one of the courses I'm teaching. - You need to go out and have more fun. - No. The last thing I need right now in my life is relationship. Who said anything about a relationship? I'm just talking about going out and having some fun. - Mommy, look! - Good try, honey. - She's a really happy girl these days. - Yeah, she is. - Good dog. That's it. That's it. - Honey. It's 11:30. He's probably not coming. - You're only saying that because you don't like him. He's coming. He's just late. - He's nearly an hour and a half late. - Most people are late sometimes. - Go get her, buddy! - Jake, I missed you. - Somebody got a present. - For me? - Yeah. Okay, buddy. Hi. - This is so cool. - Yeah. That's a guidebook to Roanfield. You know, whenever I got traded to a new city, the first thing I did was get a guidebook. That way, I knew where all the fun stuff was and all the places to make new friends. Here, I bookmarked some pages for you. Uh, page 147, the ice cream parlor... Oh, best in the county, maybe even the state. And here, page 37... Oh, crafty's pizza. Their food is so good there, and they got this arcade that is totally awesome. - Thank you. Mom, look what Ben got me. - Yeah. It's even got the best laser tag, the ice-skating rinks, and even museums. - Well, that's very sweet of you, but she's been waiting for you since 10:00. - What do you mean? I was supposed to be here at 11:00, wasn't I? No, 10:00. - Can...can we make that 11:00, please? I'm so not an early-morning person. And I'm sorry about the extra 30 minutes. I got held up in the bookstore. - Well, it was really nice of you. So we'll see you in five days at the dog park. - Okay. Ah, but 11:00, right? 11:00. - Nice. Mwah. Be good. - Mom, I found somewhere they teach tennis. - Do you want to take some lessons? - Can I? - Sure. I'll give them a call right now. We'll have to try them again in the morning. - Okay. - What the... Jake! Oh, you bad, bad dog! I can't believe you ate a piece of meat! Out! Ugh! That's it! Oh, you have really done it this time! - You're not going to give him back to Ben. - No, I am taking him here. - Now, remember, dogs are pack animals. They don't respond to weak, permissive humans. - Like Ben Fuller? - Mom. - They are much more comfortable when they know who is the boss and what the rules are. You are Alpha. You are your dog's master. You cannot ask nicely for your dog's cooperation, you must demand it. Raise your clicker. On three, say your dog's name and "sit." One, two, three, name, sit. Jake, sit. - This might take a while. - He just showed up like that. Coach put him in. And you wonder why stuff like that happens. - Yeah, I can't believe the coach actually let him play. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. - So, uh, where's Caitlin? Where's Jake? - Caitlin's with our neighbor Gail at the hamburger restaurant your book recommended. And Jake... Jake, come! Jake, come. Sit. Good boy. - Um, what did you do to my dog? - Isn't he better now? We took him to an obedience trainer. We found her from the book you gave Caitlin. It took him a while to get it. But once he did, he really took to it. You just didn't know how to bring out the best in him. - Bring out the best in him? Oh, is that what this is? No, you sucked his soul out of him. Look at the poor guy. Let me tell you something... At my house, nobody's in charge. Okay? He...he's my friend. He's not my subject. - That was his problem... And yours. - Listen, you can't take him and get him trained without my consent. - Give calm a try. You'll be surprised at how much happier he is. Jake, stay. Good boy. See you Wednesday. - Seriously? Come on, Jake. We're not going to take this lying down, are we? No, no, no. Jake, don't...Don't lie down. Come on, get up. Jake, give me kiss. Give me a kiss. Give daddy a kiss, come on. Kiss. Jake, kiss. Okay. Okay. Oh, Jakey boy. Look what I got for you. Payback time. Oh, buddy. Oh, look what I got. What's this? What's this? Jakey, come here. What's this? Come here! Get it! Oh, good boy. Good boy. Heel, heel! Oh, good boy. Heel. Good boy. Get it. Get it, boy. Jake, come. - You're early. - We aim to please. - So... How was it with a calm, trained Jake for once? - Oh, it was tough at first, but, you know, I realized once I saw it through your eyes... Or maybe I should say walked in your shoes... It was good. Jake, sit. - Good boy. All right. See you all around. Jake, stay. Have fun. - Jake, heel. Jake, heel! Jake, heel! Jake! Jake, heel! My best shoes! Jake, heel. You! Ugh! - He's really cute. - Doc, I'm fine. Look, I don't get the call if I don't play. - And you won't be playing shortstop in a t-ball league if you can't throw. I'm sorry, Ben. You're back on the d.L. This is happening too often. You're not 24. You don't heal so quick like you used to. You need to start thinking about what you're going to do with your life after baseball. - What are you talking about? There's plenty of guys playing in the majors that are older than I am. - Yeah, and they're not my problem. And no more walking that stupid mutt holding the leash in your throwing arm, okay? You're on the d.L. Jake, come. - Jake, sit. Jake, down. Jake, stay. What are you doing here? You're an hour early. - Team bus got in sooner than I thought it would. I thought I'd come by and pick up Jakey on my way home. - Well, you're lucky that I'm home, because I just got back from the trainer. I had to get him an extra lesson to undo the damage you did. - What do you mean you took him back to the trainer? I didn't say you could do that. - If I want to take him to a trainer, I will. - You are going to ruin him. We co-own Jake. You have to agree on things like that. - According to his license, I own him. - I can't believe you stole my dog. - Your dog ran away. I adopted my dog. - Jake. - Jake. - Jake! - Jake! - Jake, come here! - Jake! - Jake! - Jake! - This is all my fault. I should have trained him when he was younger. - No, it was my fault. I should have never left that front door open. It was so stupid. - If we hadn't been arguing about him in front of him, then none of this would have ever happened. - Jake is one lucky dog. According to his x-rays, he doesn't have any broken bones, and from the patterns of his bruises, I'd say he hit the side of the car running flat out. But the driver managed to stop before she ran over him. - But he's going to be... - He's going to be okay? - Yes. He's going to be fine. - Oh, yes. - Yes. Can we take him home? - I've given him something to help him sleep. He needs plenty of rest but, yeah, you can take him home today. - Thank you. - Thanks, doc. - Yeah. - Whew. - Hey, can I take him home, please? I know it should be your night, but I just... Caitlin will be really upset if she doesn't get to see him. - Yeah, of course. - Do you want to come over? I mean, while he gets settled and just to make sure that he's comfortable? - Yeah. Yeah, sure. Let me just take care of the bill. - Oh, we'll share the bill... Like we share Jake. - Hey, sleep well. Get better quickly. - Can I lay down next to him? - Sure. I think he'd like that. - Oh, I think he's gonna get plenty of tlc. Good night. - Good night. - You know, we should, uh... We should probably call a truce, you know, for Jake's sake. - I agree. So, truce? - Truce. Uh... There we go. - So what did you do? - Oh, it's just a little tendinitis. I'm on the d.L. For a couple of weeks. - Oh. - It's a disabled list. It's part of the game. - Well, I hope it heals quickly. - Yeah, you and me both. Oh, keep me posted on how Jake's doing, huh? - I promise. And thanks again for letting him stay here. - Yeah, it's no problem. - You didn't have to. Thank you for taking care of Caitlin. - My pleasure. So Ben doesn't seem all bad after all. - Behind every cloud, there's a silver lining. - Or maybe there's always a second chance to make a first impression. No, I am still not interested. - Ah. Ugh! - So do you think the truce will last? - Oh, I sure hope so. - How's it feel? - Cold and numb. - You know, you've been on the d.L. Three times already this season. - Oh, thanks for reminding me, buddy. - Injuries come with age. Better start thinking about what you're gonna do when you can't play anymore. - I'm not even gonna start thinking about it till I've had at least two full seasons in the majors. Hey, can I come in? - Hi. Sure. - Okay. How's the patient? - Uh, he's fine. - Hey, Caitlin. - Hi. - Hey, Jake. Look, I got Mr. Fuzzy bear for you, yeah. Has he been eating? - Not much. - Ah, the vet said he probably wouldn't for a couple days. Is he swallowing his pills okay? - Mm-hmm. - We're gonna watch a movie. Can you stay? - I wish. I got to jump on a bus. - Are you playing again? Uh, no, unfortunately not. I get to sit on the bench and watch them have all of the fun. Oh, speaking of which, I got to go. - Are you always late? - Caitlin! Uh, no, no, she's right. Yeah, most of the time I am. - My mother says punctuality is the politeness of kings. - She also says that nobody is perfect, and that's why pencils have erasers. Okay, well, then there's hope for me yet. Um, I'll talk you guys later. Okay. You got better, buddy. - Bye! - Bye. Yeah. - Well, so far, so good. Ice it up for another ten minutes. - Thanks, doc. - Hi. - Hey. How are you? - We're all good. - Yeah? How's Jake doing? - He's doing fine. - Um, can I talk to him? - You want to talk to Jake? - Yeah. - Sure. Caity, it's Ben, and he wants to say good night to Jake. - Hi, Ben. - Hey. - He's here. Jake, it's Ben. - Jakey, what's going on, buddy? How you doing? - Can you hear me, huh? How you doing? You miss me? Oh, buddy, hope you're doing better. Are they playing ball with you? Did you get your favorite stuffy? - Go get it, Jakey! Go get it! - Why doesn't he want to play? - He was hit by a car. - Is he okay? - Yes. - Can I pet him? - Yes, but be very gentle. - Oh, I forgot. I have a faculty meeting on Tuesday. Is there any chance you could watch Caitlin? - Sure. - Okay, thanks. Hi. - Hey. How you doing? How was the trip to the vet? - Well, he said that he needed to start getting some exercise, so we're at the dog park. - Yeah? Sounds fun. So is he ready for some Ben time? - Oh, yes. Some Ben time would do him well. - Okay, good. Why don't I come and get him from you there in about an hour? - Okay. You know what? Actually, Jake is...Is pretty much tuckered out already, and I should take him home soon so he could rest a while. But I could take him to your house at about 4:00. Okay? W-W-W... Jake's coming home. We need to clean this place before he gets here. - Jake likes the house the way it is. This is his home. - No, these days he's used to a clean, perfect, tidy home. Okay? I should have insisted that I pick him up. Wait a minute, Jake's not the only one on his way over, is he? Hey, hey, what are you doing? Those are Jake's toys. He's gonna remember that you trashed his toys, and he's not gonna forgive you for the rest of his life. You realize that, don't you? - Okay, you see that? That's a vacuum. Why don't you see if it works, huh? - Looks good. - Yeah. Yeah, good job, buddy. Oh, um, okay, she's here. Uh, cover for me, okay? - Jake, stay. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, is Ben in? - Yes. - May I see him, please? - Uh, he'll be down in a minute. We didn't get to talk much when we met the other day at the park. I'm Ryles. - I remember. I'm Megan. - So you're, uh, Jake's co-parent, huh? Oh, I guess you could call it that. - Yeah. - I'm Ben's best friend, spiritual adviser, dog Walker extraordinaire. Sometimes... - Okay, okay. I think she gets the picture. Sorry about that. I didn't know you were here. - No, that's okay. Ryles and I were getting to know each other better. Uh, good-bye, ryles. - Right. Jake, Jake, ja, Jake! - Oh, you look well. - So do you. Yeah, right. How's our patient? - Oh, right, yeah. Jake, come. - Hey, Jake. Hi, buddy. Oh, he's looking well. He's healing fast. - Jake, sit. - Wow. - And I didn't use the clicker. He doesn't need it much since the accident. - Maybe he heard us call a truce. - Maybe. Jake, heel. Nice house. - Were you expecting something different? - No. Yes. I don't know. - Oh, well, just because I play ball, what, you figured I was like some college jock with empty beer bottles and dirty laundry everywhere? - Probably. Something like that. Wow. You've won a lot of trophies. Anyway, we need to establish some ground rules for Jake so there's consistency between his two homes. - Okay. - So, first, no jumping on any of the furniture. - Oh, is he sleeping on Caitlin's bed? - Sometimes. - Uh-huh. Well, then he gets to sleep on my bed, yep, sometimes. - Okay, but those are the only two exceptions. Next, food... No human food, only dog food and only in the kitchen. - Okay, I agree about the kitchen. But he is allowed to have leftovers. - Okay. He can have leftovers. - About the furniture... Okay, he's not allowed on anything except for Caitlin's and mine's bed... Sometimes...and the sofa in front of the TV set. - All right. But that's it...Nothing else. - Yes. Deal. Shake on it. Ow! - Oh. I'm just kidding. - We will not be using these anymore... So you can trash them, smash them, do whatever you want with them. - Thank you. - So when do you go away again? - Uh, not for another nine days. - Well, we'll see you then. - Okay. Uh, actually, you know what? I was just thinking that might be too long, you know, for Caitlin... Not seeing Jake for nine days. Maybe I can bring him to you for a couple days. Um, say, Wednesday. You know, that way, she doesn't worry that he's gonna forget about her. - Thank you. That's very kind of you. I'm sure she'd like that. - Yeah, of course. It'll be really good for Jake also. I guess I'll see you then. - Hi. - I just got a call from my biggest client. She's flying in tomorrow afternoon. She needs to see me as soon as she lands. I'm sorry. I don't...I don't think I can watch Caitlin. - Oh, hey, no. Don't apologize. - Any other day, you know. - Oh, I know. I know. I'll figure something out. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah. - I can stay here on my own. I am not leaving a ten-year-old girl alone for four hours, especially in a house we just moved into. - What are you looking for? - Child care. - I don't need a babysitter! - Hey. - Hi. How's he doing? - Oh, yeah, he's doing great. Right now he's eating his dog-food dinner out of his dog bowl in the kitchen. - Good on three counts. Do you have a game to go to tomorrow? - No. - I have a big favor to ask of you. - Hmm. So which one's your favorite? - I like bubble gum and mint chocolate chip. What do you like? - I like pralines and cream. What about your mom... What's her favorite? - She likes strawberry and chocolate. Why aren't you using your sling? - Because my arms starting to feel better. I actually been throwing on it. A little more rehab, should be back to new, hopefully. - Mom said we're having pizza. - Oh, we are. We're having an upside-down dinner, which means we're having dessert before our main course. But before we have our pizza, you and I have to run a little errand. - Where? - It's a surprise for your mom, and I need your help. - What? This is amazing. - Mm-hmm. Hey! - Hi. - How was your meeting? - Oh, it was...It went very well. Thank you. Did you guys have fun? - Yeah, we did. There's some pizza here if you're hungry. - It's the best pizza in the whole country. - How do you know that? - Because Ben has eaten pizza in all 50 states. And this is the best he's ever had anywhere. - Mm-hmm. It's true. - And we went shopping. - Oh, yeah? What did you guys buy? - Something for you. Some things for you. For me? - Yeah. - Well, what did you get me? - Let me show you. - You...you didn't have to. - Uh, yeah, I should've. - Oh, they're beautiful. And they're my size. - That's because I had a clever little helper. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, she asleep? - Almost. - You got yourself a great kid. - Thank you again for bailing me out. - Yeah, no problem. We had a great time. - And for all the shoes. - Yeah, well... I owed you that much at least. Okay. Actually, uh... You know, if you're not doing anything Thursday night, I'm not playing a game. And I was wondering if, you know, ybe... - Ben Fuller, are you asking me out? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I want to take you somewhere. - Where? - Uh, that would be a surprise. - Another surprise. - I'm full of them. - Okay. Yes, thank you. - Nice! Uh, okay. Then I'll see you then. - Good night. - Good night. - Who are you going out with? - Oh, honey, I'm just having dinner with a friend. - Yeah, right. - Oh, okay. Which? - You can't start with the shoes. I have to wear one of the pairs that he bought me. Right, right, right. Um, those are cute. Well, what dresses do you have that go with those? Where is he taking you? - I have no idea. - Well, how are you supposed to know what to wear? - Why won't you tell me where you're taking her? - Because you're going to tell me I'm crazy. - These will work everywhere unless there's a dress code. - There's not a dress code. Can't believe I'm taking fashion advice from you. - Look at me. Yeah, exactly. Okay, watch your step. Watch your step. All right. - Can I please take this thing off now? - No way! Come on, you got to play along for just a little bit longer. I'm not very good at playing along. - Uh, yeah, I could've told you that. - Well, it would've helped if I knew where I was going. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Put it this way. To me... This is the most romantic place in the world. You ready? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. One, two, three... Ta-da! - A little-league field. I put on a little black dress to come to a little-league field. Are you crazy? - Ah, maybe a little. Hey. There you go. Salud. - Cheers. - You know, I literally spent my childhood here. 11 years of little league in this very park. - I didn't know you grew up in Roanfield. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I spent three years playing little league with coach Thomas. And then coach Kapinsky, coach pope, coach Jarvis, uh, coach O’Brien, and then coach Thomas again in Roanfield high. - So how did you come to play in your hometown? - Ah, it was pure luck. My contract got traded. - Did you ever think about doing anything else? - There's life after baseball? Oh, I don't know. Well, I guess I'm just too boneheaded to think about doing anything else. Enough about me. What about you? - Growing up, I always thought that I'd write the great American novel. But then I got to college and realized that other people had already done that, and probably much better than I ever would. - What? - Well, here I was thinking that my problem is I have no idea what I want to do when I grow up. Your problem is you never let yourself play like a child. - That's not true. - The part about me or you? Come on, let's play ball. - What about your arm? - Don't worry about it. Come on, I'll take it easy on you. Come on! It's all about the basics. The most important thing is your stance. Okay, feet shoulder width apart. Good. Weight on your toes, not your heels, bend your knees. - Okay. - All right. And these beautiful little baby blues of yours, keep 'em right there on that ball. You ready? - Mm-hmm. - Oh! - Whoo! - All right. Oh. - It's getting late. - What? - I better get home. - So how did it go? - Why aren't you in bed? - I was. So did you and your friend have a good dinner tonight? - We did, thank you. - So do you like him? - Like who? - Ben. - Why do you think it was Ben I went out with tonight? - Mom, it's obvious. You don't date men you work with, and he's the only other man you've met since we moved here. - Caity, Ben and I are just friends, okay? We had dinner tonight, and that's it. Go to bed. - Mom. - Bed! - Sorry. I got her in bed an hour ago, but she wouldn't go to sleep. - Oh, it doesn't matter. - So how'd it go? - It was a bad idea. I mean, why didn't I listen to myself? - It was a great idea. He's really cute. I thought you liked him. - That's not that point. I must have been crazy. - No, you weren't. Look, why can't you just go on a date with a guy that you really like and be in the moment and just have a good time? - Because I'm not an in-the-moment kind of person. I need to know what's coming. And if I'm going to date a guy, he needs to know where he's going. - Why do you need to have a future? - Because I do. - Well, we know exactly where Ben's going. He's going back to the major leagues as soon as possible. - What's he going to do when it all comes to an end? I give up. And where does that leave the two of you? You both still share Jake. - Take it easy, Jake. - Somebody's excited. Good boy. - He's happy to be here. - Yeah, I see that. Uh, where's Caitlin? - Uh, she's at her tennis lesson. - Cool. - So how long is your trip? - It's just a two-gamer. I'll be back on Monday. Um, are we okay? - I can't. I'm sorry. You're a great guy. I just... Can we just be friends? - Look, Megan... - Please. - Okay. Yesterday didn't happen. - Great. So I will drop him off on Monday. - Yeah. - Okay, see you then. - Wow, the "can we still be friends" line, huh? How many times have you used that? Did she mean it? - I don't know. - Well... Sorry, buddy. - It's okay. What I need to do is focus on getting back in the game. Hi. - Hi. - Go inside.

You like him, and he likes you. You're making each other totally unhappy. There's nothing complicated about it. - Dude, you're playing again. You're supposed to be happy. Man, I cannot believe that you of all people are giving up this easily. Why don't you just call her? - And say what? What, "I'm sorry that I asked you out on a date"? I'm not. What I am sorry about is that it didn't work out, okay? I'm sorry that I can't get her out of my mind. - You know, the trouble with adults is they can be stubborn. They dig in their heels, and they won't budge. - Then we have to budge them. And we have to do it before it's too late. - And how do you propose we do that? - We have to get them together somewhere where they have to talk to each other. From the mouths of babes. Okay. And I suppose you have a plan? - Oh, yeah. - Good boy. Happy birthday, buddy. - Happy birthday, Jake. - Hey. - Happy birthday, Jake. - Get that bone, buddy. - Mmm, yummy cake. - Supermarket special. - Don't you have something else for Jake? - Oh, I do. I forgot. It's in the kitchen. Uh, ryles, would you help me? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, sure. - You need my help too? - No, we're good. Want to come too? - Sure. - I think we've been left alone on purpose. - Uh-huh. I think so. - I, um...I saw in the paper that you're playing again. - Oh, really? You checking up on me? - Maybe, every now and then. - I missed you. - Me too. I think I made a mistake. - Hmm. Well, I think that we should try again. - Well, why don't we take it one step at a time and see where it leads us? - Okay. Let's do exactly that. - Well, I'm glad that's over. - Oh. - Ben, how come we haven't been to one of your games before? - I don't know. I didn't know you were interested in going. You ever been to a baseball game before? - I've never dated a player before. - Okay, well, we're gonna have to make that right. Two tickets to the next home game coming up. - Yes! - All right. All right, score. - Yeah! Put it there, partner. - Hello! Can I come in? - Absolutely. - Whoa, look at you two, looking all cute. - Thanks. - Ready to go? - Are we late? - Of course. - Yeah, we got to rock and roll. Come on. Mm-hmm. Hey, what's up, coach? Hold on a second. Uh-huh. Oh. Right. Okay, well, thanks for letting me know, coach. - Is everything okay? - Uh, well, I'm not playing today. - What? Why? - I've been traded. Well, the bottom line is I’m going to have to be back east for at least the next year or two. - Do you have any choice about it? - I mean... Not if I want to make a play for the majors again. I obviously don't fit into this organization's plans any more. - And if you go to New Jersey? - I don't know. I mean, they seem to want me. There's got to be a chance. - Then you have to go. A dream as big as yours is a part of you, and you have to chase it, or you have to choose to let it go. You can't let anyone else take that away from you. - Yeah, you're right. - What happens to Jake? - That hasn't been decided, honey. - I think he should stay with you guys. - Do you know anyone where you're going? Do you have any friends there? - No. - I know how that feels. And I know how much better you'll feel having Jake with you. Also... He's known you since he was a puppy. He'll miss you more than he'll miss us. We have to put Jake first, mom. He has to go with Ben. - Are you sure? - Hey, buddy. - I'm going to miss you. You look after Ben, okay? - Are you sure you don't want us to take you to the airport? - No, it's probably better if we say good-bye here, because, you know, Caitlin... - Come on... We better go if you don't want to miss your plane. Let's go, buddy. - In you go. Don't forget me. - Come on, boy. Good, boy! - You know, I wouldn't mind missing my plane, but... - You should go. - Bye, sweetie. - Come on, we've got school supplies to buy. We've both got big first days next week. - Okay. - Are you sure you have everything you need? - Yes, mom. I'm not a little kid anymore. - I know, but today is your first day at your new school. Are you sure you don't want me to drive you? - Anna's mom is on her way, and you're picking us up from school. Oh, that's Anna's mom. I have to go. - Don't I get a kiss? - I wish Jake was here. - Me too. - And Ben. - Have a great first day. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Can I come in? - Oh, hi! - Teddy and I are going to the dog park. And I think he wants the two of you to come along too. - Oh, we're right in the middle of Caitlin's homework. - Just half an hour. Please? - She's a real dog person. You are too, although you won't admit it. - Maybe. But we're not getting another one... Not for a while. - Who says you have to? - Jake? - Jake? - Jake! - Jake? Ben? You knew? - Of course. You! - What are you doing here? - Oh, it's good to see you. Uh, well, I was back east, and I realized for the first time in my life, I have something in my heart other than baseball. Now, it doesn't mean I gave up dreaming. It's just now I have a dream that doesn't include the majors. And that dream is about us. - Well, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna play for the rays? - I'm done. Baseball has been very good to me over the years, but it's time for me to give a little back. I'm taking over for coach Thomas. You're now looking at the new baseball coach at Roanfield high. Wow. - I know, right? Finally figured out what I want to do when I grow up. That's to be with you. I love you. - I love you too. - Were you surprised? - You! Yes. - Come here! Give me some love. Oh! Come here. Hey, hey, hey, what's going on here?
