(Whispering) Hello. You called for a distiller? Yes, come in. I spoke with a man on the phone.. Moses. Yes, Moses. He said 9:00. I assumed he meant p.m. P.M. is prime time. I've missed my stories. Well, I guess I thought since they come out at night, that that would mean.. No, they come out all the time, we just notice them more at night because you don't have anything better to do. And your name is? My name is Matthew Moon. Has it been happening all over the house? Mostly in the study, although we've been hearing them in other places as well. Just hearing? You haven't seen anything? We've had several items go missing. We thought someone had been stealing from us. What about batteries going dead before they're supposed to? What about food expiring before it's supposed to? Now that you mention it, we've been having trouble keeping milk fresh without.. Milk! Shit. You didn't drink any of it, did you? No, should I have? It's just that milk makes them strong, makes them excitable. It does more than just a body good. Did you get the items Moses asked you to get? Yes. Yes, I picked them up last night. Let me go and get them for you. I have been finding crumbs everywhere. Could that mean anything? This is bad place to put cookies. Hm. This is too cheap, it won't work. Moses just said rum, he didn't say expensive rum. He didn't say cheap rum either. Where's your liquor cabinet? It's to the left. No. No. No, farther left. Aha. That was a gift! Are you sure none of these other bottles will do? How do they even know the difference? You said the Reading Room, right? Yes! They like sweets. Can you hear that? (Whispering) They can smell the bourbon. Ok, now I need your blood. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why can't we use your blood? Well, that'll cost you extra. A lot extra. A Swiss Army Knife? Shouldn't it be a magic knife, with a dragon skull carved into it, or some other iconography? This knife has a can opener, a screwdriver, and performs ritual blood letting. It also has a toothpick. That sounds pretty magical to me. I can draw my own blood. Here. It dissipates with time, but trust me.. It's in there. And whatever you do, don't ever open it. Unless you want to cause some trouble again. And don't ever drink it. You, you're not taking it with you. No, it's yours, for you to display as you please. No. No, no, no, no. My cleaning woman is extremely superstitious. She would never allow this to be in our home. She would quit cleaning, the whole place would.. If you want me to take it.. My wife would never allow it. It's going to cost you more. Fine. Fine. Take it with you. Whatever it costs, just get it out of my house. Fine. What the hell was that anyway? Oh, it'll be itemized on your bill. Hi. Matt? Yeah, I just flew in. We just got your package for Blue in the mail. I'll put her on after she opens it. Yeah, sure. How's the birthday girl? She's been asking about you. We got your postcard from Santa Fe. They thought you said you saw Santa Claus. How's the weather? Oh, the weather's fine. It's hot as always. They were predicting rain Yay! For us today, but it turned out to be nice for her party later. Great. That's great. How's the fish? It's really big. It was a nice thought, but Charlie would rather watch TV or play games. I think he's going to be more of an indoor kid. Yay! Blue... No! Blue, Uncle Matt's on the phone. Hi Uncle Matt. Say thank you for the teddy bear. Hi Blue, happy birthday. Did you get the box of styrofoam peanuts I sent you? Say thank you! Thank you for the teddy bear. I really love it. Oh, was there one of those in the box too? Good. Give me the phone. Bye! Hey Matt. Charlie! Matt, I gotta go. Charlie, what are you doing? I mean, we'll probably have a connecting flight somewhere in Heathrow. We should meet up for dinner or something. Hi. Looks like I'm late for the party. Sorry I'm late. Family business to attend to. Apparently they're not taking Visa in Saudi Arabia these days. Another client declined to keep their souvenir from the experience, I take it. Either we're not charging enough for its storage or people just aren't as sentimental as they used to be. Only you would be morbid enough to keep these things as decorations. Besides, storage is our most profitable service. This one caused me enough trouble that I'd like to hang onto it. Have it sent back with Fussell. Your trophy collection is more trouble than it's worth. Better that they be kept safe in my disused house than in some storage facility where a hapless maintenance worker can come along and have the drink of his life. And yet you take your caretaker to put them away, despite the fact that you won't tell him what's inside. I hate it when they look at me. Where's Baynes? Baynes run into trouble? No. Trouble ate him. Most of him, at least. We found the body. We're shipping him back to Akron tomorrow. Moses, that'll cost an arm and a leg. You're awful. I mean, it's expensive to ship a body. Especially if there's so little of him left to ship. And I mean it, you're an awful, cheap bastard. You wouldn't want to be sent back to your family? For God's sake Moses, when I die, go ahead, cremate me. Send me home in an envelope, ok? I suppose we just tell the postman it's a package of coffee? Pepper. I hate coffee. We recovered this with Baines' body. You'll need it for the ritual. You're not sounding very good. You feel all right? No worse than you look. Yes, but I look a little worse every year. Maybe you should take some time, go visit your girlfriend, what's her name, Blue? Blue's my niece, Moses. Spend some money for once. Take time. You know better than most you can't take it with you. I'll take time when the holidays come. You don't look like you'd last another week, let alone five months. The holidays. Now if you'll excuse me, your time is my money. Don't forget to wear something warm. Well, there's your problem. He probably wanted it back in his cave. Or wherever you stole it from. You're no Humble Bumble. This is for you. Stop touching the radio. When you drive, you'll get to pick what we listen to. When I drive, we get to listen to listen to you running your mouth, which pretty much drowns everything else out. I'm sure you'll really miss hearing one of the 20 classic rock songs they play in a loop because you really needed to hear "Stairway" just one more time. You know what, if someone didn't forget which bag she packed the iPod in... You know, it's too bad you feel like tuning me out, instead of speaking with me. You won't be seeing as much of me, now that's I've got my own place. Would you stop shoving that in my face? You know, you'd still be living at home too, if Uncle Matt left me the house. Jealous? Yeah. How could I not be? Twenty years of wondering what the hell happened to him, and the last message I get is a box of reruns of "ALF" on VHS? You loved "ALF." You loved it so much. And you got a house. I mean, how fair is that? You watched those shows with him when we'd visit. It's a sentimental gift. I mean, who even has a VCR anymore? The only place we'll be able to watch them is at your house. Your house. Maybe I'll spend the weekend reminiscing about my '80s childhood. And you get to clean up 20 years of disrepair and junk. You know, it's so cute when you get all sulky. That's how I know you'll really miss me. What time are we supposed to meet, uh, what's-his-face, the caretaker? Mr. Fussell? We're early, still got, like, half an hour. I can't believe it's been 20 years since he disappeared. Yeah, well, he was almost always away on business anyway. He hardly ever came home, except for on holidays. That's why it took people so long to even file a missing person's report. He was always just, out there somewhere. bell tolls) Missing episodes of "ALF." Yeah, that's why he taped 'em. Nowadays, I suppose he could have just watched them on his phone, wherever he was working. That's true, and there'd be no commercials. Old commercials are fun! That's the best part of old tapes! There's plenty of ads on the Internet. Sure, and in the future, when they implant Wi-Fi in your brain, you won't need memories anymore either. Ha ha. Here's a set of keys for you. You should find most things in decent order. Most things. It's dusty and there's mail everywhere. I ran out of places. I don't know where to put everything after 20 years. Well, it'll be nice to have someone in the old house again. And Mr. Fussell won't have any excuses to not help out and leave me. I was up there yesterday and turned on the gas. The wiring is old up there, and don't be surprised if the electricity goes out. You should check the hot tub before you turn it on. The hot tub! I totally forgot he had one. Sweet! And be careful. I set up mice traps down in the basement. The roof's still in good condition. So's the television. Mr. Fussell leaves me alone often enough to check on that. Grace, go see what Toby's barking about. If you need any help.. You can call a handyman. He's done more than his fair share of helping out around here. Enough. If Toby hops the fence, you can go after him. It's your turn. Hey cool, Uncle Matt's hat! What? What are you doing? Would you give me that! You have to lean into it ... like you mean it. You want to try again? Whoa. Guess dear old Mrs. Fussell wasn't the only thing being neglected, huh? Looks like the TV's pretty well taken care of, and the snacks. Let's hope for that old guy's sake that, uh, those aren't 20 years old. Whoa! What? Nuthin', just.. A mouse? Nope, not a mouse. Mr. Fussell.. I'll take care of it. Was talking about a mouse. I'm aware. What? There's a mouse down there. It's dead! I'm not touching it. I'll take care of it. Yeah. That's what you're here for. Great. Lucky me. Water works. Hm. Wonder who's been paying for it? Look at these bills. Second notice. Third notice. Second final notice. Absolutely fin.. I mean, do they even do that anymore? I think it's an old thing. Yeah, probably before they had collections agencies. Probably pretty hard to repo water. Ugh. Did you know that coffee can grow mold? Who knew? That's terrible. Mmm. And you can clean that too. Thanks. Hope this isn't a support web. Chair still works. Blue Bear! Aw, look who you found. It's like no time has passed at all, from when we used to stay here as kids. Yeah, you're right. I mean, with no one here to pass the time, I guess time didn't even pass. So I guess you can take the bottom bunk, and I'm gonna take the master bedroom upstairs. That was Uncle Matt's. I think we should leave it alone, at least for the time being. Ok, fine. Can I at least take the room next door? Is that off-limits? It's yours. I just think I'm a little too old to be sharing a bunk bed with my sister. Fine, it's yours. Oh, do you remember this? Hey, you want to go down to the pond with me, see if we can catch anything? You know that there are never any fish in there, right? Mom and Dad just sent us down there to, uh, waste some time? Ugh. Why wouldn't they have put a light switch at the top of the stairs? This basement always gave me the creeps. Oooooh, Charlie, it's the furnace talking. Found it. You ok? Come on. The pinball machine! Wonder if it still works. Think it saved my high score? Amazing that it saved that after all these years. Hm. Ugh. Oh man, this is awesome. You gotta come... Hey, what is that? I think it's supposed to be liquor. Holy awesome. Uncle Matt must have been some kind of bootlegger. Hey. Uh, wha.. What? First one's for Uncle Matt. There's plenty for you to get loaded on at the party tomorrow. Let's finish up. Come on. Damn straight. Whole basement full of moonshine? This Fourth of July, I'm going to celebrate by becoming independent from my pants. It was right over there! It followed me all the way home and just stood outside my window, staring, like it weren't never gonna stop. That was the time you tried to have sex in the graveyard, huh? What happened to the girl? Huh. She's all right. Boy she was pissed! She heard something but didn't think it was worth me jumping up and running away. Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but people don't tend to live long, fruitful lives once they actually see a Black Shuck. A Black.. Shuck. Matches the description of what you saw. In the old days, there was a superstition, that the first person buried in a new cemetery was given the task of protecting that cemetery from evil. But to keep human souls off guard duty, churches started a new custom. In the first grave of a new cemetery, they would bury a black dog, usually a Lab or a Shepherd. And they would bury this dog alive. Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's messed up, man. This thing ain't no dog! It was big, like a, like a gator or a coyote or something. They get that way after being dead for a few centuries. But once you've seen one, you've only got three days before you end up buried in the same cemetery that it guards. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you mean, "seen"? As in looked at, you know, with your eyes. But I did that! And tonight's your third night, which is why I'm sure you'll understand you need cash up front if we're to go further. Ohhh, I don't like this. You don't have to. When I hired you, Moses didn't say nuthin' about me havin' to play bait. What are you doing? I thought I made that clear. I can't look in its eyes, or it'll come after me. But you've already looked at it, and you can't die twice. What, why can't you just kill it? Because it's already dead. You did take physics in high school, didn't you? Look, just lead it down the alley, onto the seal, and I'll take care of the rest. First.. you'll need some of this. You're damn straight. No, actually, not like that. Oh. He needs to be able to smell you. What? Here boy. Damn mutt. Here boy. Ugh, nice night for a walk. Ooh! Least y'all ain't drivin'! Damn mutt. Whoa, what's there? Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt, do something! Tell me when he's on the seal. Just, just do it, now! Is he drinking the rum? Tell me when he's drinking the rum. It's tasting me! Good. Work, work, work. Damn boxes. Whew! Smile! I need to document this, otherwise no one back home will ever believe you were helpful. Ha ha. Now where do you want me to put this. This is getting heavy. Hold on a minute. I just want to make sure you had your eyes open. Looking good Chuck. Ok, gimme that. I don't know, I think we're going to have to delete this one. There's definitely something wrong. Don't delete that! Hey, there is something there. What is that? I don't know, probably a lens flare, or a reflection of the window. No, it almost looks like some kind of animal. Yeah, sure it is. If you want to see things, I don't know, maybe look for Elvis or the Virgin Mary in your soup, but I am getting hungry, and it is dinnertime. Do you hear that? Huh? Oh, that was me, sorry. No, not that. It sounded like a dog. That's funny. Usually I'm the one who blames it on the dog. Could Mr. Fussell's dog have gotten loose and come over here? How could he get inside or upstairs without either of us even know.. I hear it downstairs now. Ugh. There's nothing out on the porch. There's nothing here either. It definitely sounded like a dog though, right? Looks like you've settled in for the evening. Mm-mm. I got a hot date, with the pinball machine. Sounds like more exercise than you're used to. Try not to hurt yourself. I need you to help put up decorations in the morning before the parade. Yeah yeah. Son of a.. Hm. Hm. Guess it can't get any worse. Yeah sure it works now Charlie. What the.. Charlie? Damn. Whoa. Ugh. Whoa. Toby? Is that you boy? Did you sneak out of Mr. Fussell's yard to see if we had any table scraps? Damn it, Charlie, not funny. How long were you out here waiting for me? That sounds more like bear than dog. Come on, we'd better get inside. Did you drink this whole bottle? This stuff smells like you could use it to de-clog a shower drain. Everything's locked. If it is a bear, it won't be poking its nose around in here. I really wish you would think before you drank so much. You need water. I don't want you to be hung over in the morning. What the hell's gotten into you Charlie? Stop being an asshole. They'll be no more drinking for you at the party tomorrow. Ohhh. Hey! Douchebag! Enjoy your milk. It'll be the last time you get so drunk you forget you're lactose intolerant. Ugh, oh. Oh, uh. Ugh. Grace, go check on the dog. What's a matter with you? You're sitting right there, you can't go check on the dog? Oh, jeez. Just go check on him. I check everything myself. Toby. Toby. Where are you, boy? Come here Toby, come. Whoa. Grace, you ok? (Murmurs) Blue... Charlie? DId you call me? Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. What are all the Xs for? Oh, the number of Xs is relative to how dangerous the contents are. I think you should probably take it with you. It'll cost extra. Well all right, may-maybe we can work something out, uh.. You're the best. Wait, I have something for you, also. Yeah? Oh, thank you. That's exactly what I expected you to give me. Great. What is it? Well.. it has lots of names, actually. People give lots of names to hungry, evil things that hide in dark corners and wait for children. Bloody bones, a Der Schwarze, a Duende. What? A damn bogeyman. Jesus. People invoke all kinds of names to get their children to behave. Some of those names are real, and this one certainly would've eaten your son, if you hadn't called. Why don't you have a seat? Are you ok? Wait right here, I'll get you some water. Oh. What the... Where... Oh, thank goodness. Morning. Thanks for making coffee. There'd have been none if I waited for youu. Hey, how did I end up on the floor of your room last night? I don't remember a thing. I bet you don't. Yeah, I should probably lay off that moonshine. At least until you learn some self-control. Just because you open a bottle, doesn't mean you have to finish it. I drank a whole bottle! And turned into a total dick. Oh. Blue, I'm so sorry. What did I do? I don't know. It's like you're a different person when you drink. Just forget about it. Finish putting up the decorations. I'm going to shower before the parade. Mr. Fussell? Mrs. Fussell? It's Blue. Blue Moon, from up the hill. I think your dog may have gotten into our yard last night. Just thought someone should know. Truce? It's a holiday. Come on, it's fun. Would you just take it? Ok. It's a pinwheel! It's your favorite. Thank you. About last night. Just, try to let it go. It was probably just a power surge or a malfunction with the fuse box or something. There was a light! Yes. Televisions have lights? You remember, Mr. Fussell said there was something wrong with the electricity. I don't know. You were already on edge from me, and I apologized, and the dog ... the bear? I want you to look at it before you leave. Ok, fine, I'll look at it. You know I'm no electrician. Or anything handy. I'll try. Do you think we'll be able to see the fireworks in the bay from the house tonight? Nah, probably not. But you know what we could do. We could all go down to the beach on our side of the bay. At least we'd have some privacy there. Here, here, here. Charlie, here. Charlie, what's in these cases over here by the cooler? It's some kind of liquor, man. I mean, I think my uncle was some kind of moonshiner. I'd be careful drinking that. Charlie turned into a complete asshat yesterday after drinking some. It doesn't take much, does it? Hey, Toby! Hey Blue. I told you Toby got loose. (Murmuring) And this is the loft. Got your haunted TV, a futon. Nice. A pretty chill place. Cool. That was Uncle Matt's bedroom. I don't know what I'm going to use it for yet. Cool. And that's the tour. (Murmuring) Linda. You interested? Sure, what the hell, right? Nice! Here's two. Sweet. Ugh, that smells disgusting. Maybe I'll just have a beer. Ugh! Smells like my grandfather. So, uh, Charlie was telling me that he has a pinball machine, in the basement? And you thought that would entice me downstairs? Come on, pinball wizard. Let's see those flipping fingers. Mmm. Burger or dog? Burger. Burger with cheese. Hot dog it is. No I want a burger. Too bad. I want a burger, with cheese. I want to make her a burger, and I want to make you a hot dog. Um, I'm going to go to the bathroom. I know you know how to make burgers. Mm, I don't know how to make burgers. I don't even know what a burger is. Burger, cheese, bun. Hm. What an ugly bear. Mah! Oh, look at all this stuff here. Come on. I thought we were going to play pinball. Damn it! Ugh. It's ok.. It's not like it's going to stain the basement floor or anything. Yeah but. Come on. Ah! What? What, what-what is it? What? A mouse. Yeah, but, so what? Get rid of it. Where? Someplace where I'm not fooling around with you. Which is going to be everywhere in a minute. Fine... Ugh. Nothing here. Who wants overcooked meat? Ugh, gimme that. Wait. Fair enough. Wait, I have to go to the bathroom. Sorry. I'll be right back. Yeah, hurry up. I will. So, there's a pinball machine in the basement. I don't think so. But, but I'm a pinball wizard. Uh, no. Ugh. Mmm. (Murmuring) Now I gotta change. Your friend Dana? Asleep in my bed for some reason? She was sitting in the sun all afternoon drinking. That could wipe anybody out. It would have been nice if she asked permission before she just crawled right in. It's my bed! It's my house, I really don't think you need to be getting possessive over it. Right, everything here is yours. That's right. And that bed was where Mom and Dad slept anyway. Your bed was the top bunk, and the only thing keeping you from it is a pile of junk mail. Feel free to clean it off if you suddenly need to lie down. Ooh. Oh, what'd you do, fall asleep? I'll wake you up. Tickle, tickle. What are you doing? Hey. Hey, where are you guys going? Hey Blue. When are the fireworks gonna start? Uh, it's getting dark now. We should probably head down to the beach if we wanna get there in time. You know. It's gettin' kind of cold for Fourth of July. Yeah. Maybe I'll get a jacket. Look, please don't say anything. Blue is already freaked out from last night. Just keep this on the down-low, all right? You guys, just relax, trust me? Have a little drink, it'll be ok. Hey, we were going to take those down to the.. Shut up, Blue's friend. Just have a drink, it'll all be fine. You didn't even see anything. I know what I saw. You said you didn't even see a thing! Blue, can we take the bottles down to the beach? Yeah sure, knock yourselves out. You know what? Fine. (Murmur) Here we go! (Murmur) Race you down to the beach! It's getting kind of chilly. Maybe we should bring some jackets. Hey. We're all headin' down to the beach. You ready? Nah, you guys go ahead. Not really feeling up to it. Why you being such a douche this weekend? You can't just come out on the beach and enjoy the fireworks with the rest of us? You know, they're your friends, not mine. You're my friend too. I'm your brother. Exactly. We can see each other only when obligated to by family stuff and not be bothered with the rest of the year? But that's not how we are. We're friends. We do things together. Are we? Or am I just here to help you move your crap? Ugh. I can't believe you! You can't even accept when someone is trying to be nice to you. What the ... I don't have anything else to say to you. Just leave, go home. Blue.. really sorry about the way I've been acting all weekend. No you're not. If you didn't want to come, you shouldn't have come. I thought you'd be excited for me. Look. It's pretty obvious I'm jealous of you. Getting your own place? And I get to be one of those guys, you know? Almost 30 and still living at home with mom and dad. And you're absolutely right. I mean, we're not just related. You're my best friend. And I want to you to have fun and be successful here. I'm sorry if I haven't been supportive enough. What the hell? Oh! Oh! (Muttering) Charlie? (Muttering) (Muttering) Hm. Ah. Hm. What is this? Mail for me? From 1993? Dear Blue. Enclosed in this package, please find the remains of one Matthew Moon, delivered in accordance with his final wishes. For over a decade, I had the pleasure of employing this peculiar and efficient man who claimed to be your uncle. Unfortunately, our relationship rarely went beyond business. In fact, all I really knew about his personal life is your name and his home address, where I shipped a great deal of usual cargo on his behalf. Moses? Bagg? I feel compelled to warn you. Do not open any liquor bottles you find among Matt's possessions. And never let anyone drink from them.. Oh my God. They're cursed. The bottles! (Murmuring) (Murmuring) (Murmurs) Don't! O-open the bottles! Don't.. There's Blue! The bottles! (Murmuring)
