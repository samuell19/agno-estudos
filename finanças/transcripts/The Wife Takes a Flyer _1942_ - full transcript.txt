Major Zellfritz... Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. Last night we shot down another British flyer. Another? Good, ja, good. That makes 10 this week. Ten? Oh, good. We only lost 18 flyers this week. Last week we got 12 British flyers and we only lost 54. The week before we got 18 and we only lost 68. If this keeps up, pretty soon no more British flyers. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. Our planes got him while contacting a secret radio station north of Amsterdam. Good, then any information he got is worthless now that he is dead. But he is not dead. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. You man the place? Ja, Ja, he's not dead? Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. Is not dead? No. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. His plane crashed, plane crashed. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. And he bailed out. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. He was is in hiding. We must search for the British flyer and the radio station will be taken care of later on. We clip his wings, or he's a dead pigeon, ja. Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. Schmidt, you take charge in searching the north side of the city. Schmutz, you take the east. Schloffer, you take the south, and you, Major, the west end. ALL: Heil Hitler. ALL: Heil Hitler. Remember, Major, you will only search for the British flyer, nothing else. Ja, I have eyes only for the British flyer. I look at nothing else. Heil Hitler. (FALTERING) Heil Hitler. Go ahead. Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, Mueller. Slower, Mueller, slower. Stop, Mueller, stop. (BELL RINGING) Oh, I do not remember seeing those legs in the last census. Perhaps, we should investigate. After all, these are war times. Alien legs should be regarded with suspicion. Ja, ja. No. I will investigate this myself. Get my other uniforms. Uh, I may change my billet tonight, my patriotic duty, you understand, and do not forget my medals. (BELL RINGING) Who is billeted here? Corporal Heidne of the 4th Army of Occupation. Corporal Heidne. Heil Hitler. How do you do? What is it, Jan? I am Mrs. Woverman. Major Zellfritz. Propaganda, press and education. Call Corporal Heidne. I'm sorry to disturb you but I must have quarters in this section of the city at once. But we already have a Corporal billeted here. Government business. It is imperative. (STAMMERING) I'm afraid we haven't room... The Corporal. Him? I will throw out. Corporal Heidne, there's an officer down stairs, wants to see you at once. Oh, yes? Then you'd better clean my room. Well, first I have to look after Mr. Hendrik's room. He's expected home tonight. (SOLDIER GIVING COMMANDS) Squad halt. Hello, have you seen anything of that British flyer? No, there's no sign of him around here. You know the penalty for hiding one of the enemy? Only too well. Come. Thanks. This way, sir, I'll let you in here. But, Major, I tell you that the Colonel himself who was formerly our butcher gave me this place. Do you question my orders? No, sir, but this is very comfortable, and... Comfort? Bah, we must be hard. Report to your barracks at once. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. If you'll excuse me I'll see about getting your room ready. This family bears strict watching, sir. They act most peculiarly. ANITA: ...any longer. Discuss it or not, you're not going to divorce Hendrik. I am, I tell you, I... Excuse us. You see what I mean? Ja, ja, ja. That's my daughter-in-law, she's divorcing my son, Hendrik, tomorrow. Hmm... So... He's returning from the sanitarium tonight, he's had a nervous breakdown. I think you are taking advantage of the situation. Yes, you're very unfair. Unfair? Yes. Never has there been a divorce in the Woverman family. I can't help that. Children, this is Major Zellfritz, who is to be billeted here. My son, Thomas. So? Maria, his wife, and Anita, my younger son's wife. Charmed. Her husband returns tonight. I shall be happy to meet him. Uh, please. Now we shall all get acquainted, uh? First, I shall tell you about myself. Thanks for not giving me away. Oh, it's nothing, sir. I'm afraid you can't stay. There's a German Corporal billeted here. Oh, I don't want to stay. I just need some civilian clothes, so I can get around. I have several contacts to make. Oh, yes indeed. Right here. They're all prepared. Haven't you something less conspicuous than tails? This is just an informal escape, you know. Oh, yes, yes, indeed, sir. What? It looks like the moths have been saving this for a rainy day. Here, this should be all right. This way, sir. Will I pass for a Dutchman? Mmm-hmm. Well, a bath would aid the deception, sir. Where? Here, sir. Where's the Cafe Savoy? Near the Courthouse Square, sir. I have to be there before it closes. Well, curfew is at 9:30, but I shouldn't go there if I were you, sir. It's an officer's hangout. Oh, I'll be all right. After all, anyone could go in and have a cup of coffee, can't he? Oh, yes, sir, if one cares for coffee made from acorns. They're even robbing the squirrels now, sir. Oh, I... I'll tell Mrs. Woverman you're here. I'll be right back, sir. Oh, are you, uh, leaving us, Corporal? Yes. Oh, I'll open the door. That leaflet writing Major is putting me out. He's taking my quarters. They want to put the entire population in a concentration camp, but I say no, only the men. Oh, now that you know all about me, you can regard me as one of the family. (DOOR OPENS) (PANTING) Oh, Jan, Major Zellfritz will be quartered here. Will you see that his room is made ready? Yes, madam. Well, Jan, don't just stand there. Since I'm to live here with you I would be very hurt if you treat me as a stranger. I shall need some fresh linens. Oh, I'll get them for you. You were discussing your divorce, I believe. Continue, please. There is nothing more to discuss. As my brother's attorney, I say there will be no divorce. And when my Thomas says there won't be, believe me, there won't be. Thank you, my dear. All you're thinking about is alimony anyway. That isn't true and you know it. Well, you may be sorry when the wolf comes to your door. I'd rather have him get me than Hendrik. Now, really, Anita. Oh, Thomas, please, this is a private affair. But there is nothing private, the trial tomorrow is public, is it not? Yes. Good. (DOOR OPENS) I shall go now to my room now. But... But Jan has not yet had time to arrange things. I shall go up and oversee his work, so it can be arranged to my liking. But wouldn't you... Wouldn't you like a cup of coffee first, Major? We have real coffee. Real coffee, bah... Impossible. After you. Something must be wrong, Mama's very upset. Your daughter-in-law is a charming woman, Mrs. Woverman, a charming, charming woman. (BELL RINGING) The door, Major, excuse me. I'll answer it, Mama. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. ZELLFRITZ: You are looking for the British flyer. We are, Major. You will show them around. Come, all of you, quickly. Lead the way, Mrs. Woverman. Oh, Anita, what do you think... Hendrik is home already. Really? How delightful. Follow. Follow. When did he get here, Mama? Just a little while ago. He's in his room now. Fine, as long as he isn't in mine. Ja, ja. How is he looking, Mama? Well, I hope. Oh, he's changed a lot. You probably won't even recognize him, Anita. You'll be surprised how different he looks. I'd recognize Hendrik, no matter how he's changed. Whose room is this? Mine. And this? Yours. And that is my son, Hendrik's. Yes, that's as far away as I could get him. So, I am in the middle? What a lovely position. Uh, we will start here and proceed systematically. After you. You, too. Well, it's really not a bad fit, sir. A little drafty, don't you think? Mr. Hendrik does have broad shoulders. What? Down here? I'll fix that, sir. And look at this. I'm practically naked from wrist to elbow. Well, couldn't you tuck in the arms, sir? I feel like Gargantua. Hendrik. Stop making faces at your wife. Darling... I'd forgotten how lovely you are. (YELLS) What a way to treat a husband who has just come from a sanitarium. Yes. Yes, and they treated me very badly there too. Please. Oh, no, don't push me away. I need you so. Why every night at the sanitarium was like a year. A year of torture without my angel. (CHUCKLES) Isn't he sweet, Major? He always calls her angel and never Anita. Anita, my angel! Oh, you'll never know how they mistreated me, how they beat me, over the head. Here, feel. Now, see here. MRS. WOVERMAN: Don't be too hard on him, Anita. Hendrik, Anita is divorcing you tomorrow. What, so soon? Yes. So, you are Hendrik. You must excuse how he looks, and how he acts. The sanitarium, you know. Yeah, of course. My dear fellow, you must bear all this with fortitude. After all, a woman is a woman. Not my Anita. She's no ordinary woman. She's one in a million. Ja, ja, one in a million. Darling, look into your heart. Surely I must still have a place there, for the sake of all we've meant to each other, for those unforgettable moments we've shared together... Let's try again. No, my mind is made up. Well, at least let's talk it over tonight. All right, I'll... I'll talk it over. Oh, my angel, you're so kind, so forgiving. A moment ago you loathed him. Oh, I know, but I... She still loathes me. I've been a beast. Reconciliations are often most unsatisfactory. Do not be hasty, my dear. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing? Out. I shall see you all at dinner in one hour and no soup. Now, would you please explain? Shh! They have gone downstairs. You were magnificent. Thanks. Thanks to all of you. Now, how can I get out of here? You can't go now. We'd have to make explanations. It would put us in a dangerous position. Well, I know, but I've got a job to do. I have to contact a man. Of course, I understand. I realize we mustn't keep you from your duty, only... Sir, it has put the family in serious danger. Besides, the Major heard you say you were going to talk to Anita tonight about a reconciliation. Uh, can't you stay until morning? It will be much safer for you, the searching party will be gone. All right, till morning. There, that's settled. Wait a moment. What about Hendrik? He may arrive at any minute, then what will we do? Oh, you'll have to stick him in a closet, a large closet. (BELCHES) An excellent dinner, excellent. No meat, but what of it? I'm tired of meat. I eat it three times a day. You people are lucky. Good bread, coffee... What more can you ask? Especially such coffee. We used to be coffee importers before... My compliments. I enjoyed your coffee almost as much as the executions this morning. The fools tried to assist some English flyers. Ja. I will like living here with you, fine coffee, good company. (SNIFFS) You smoke too much. The Fuehrer never smokes. He will someday. You two, I watched you very closely during dinner. You hardly touched your food. You seem nervous about something. Your divorce? You're unusually observant, Major. Naturally, it is my training, very little escapes me. I rank very high in the division of propaganda. You know, during the first three weeks of the campaign I scattered three million leaflets over England. Hmm, did they do any damage, Major? Irreparable damage. They informed the misled people of the true situation. Ah, but you never can tell about the English. It would be just like them not to believe a word of 'em. Ah, the family album. Hmm. I would like to see what you all looked like when you were young. My grandparents. Ah, a charming Aryan couple, ja. And my brothers and sisters. Ah! Oh, that's me. It does not look like you. Well, naturally I've changed a little, haven't I, Mama? Uh, yes, Hendrik, uh, naturally. Have you a baby picture like this? No, but I am going to have one taken some of these days. This one I can guess myself. It is you and your husband, eh? Yes. Taken on your wedding day, of course. Yes. That was our wedding picture. Hmm. I would like very much to see a picture of Hendrik and you on your wedding day. No! No wedding pictures, rice, old shoes... Look, here comes the bride. No wedding pictures! I can't stand them. They drive me crazy. No wedding pictures. (GRUNTING) There, there, there, Hendrik. Be calm. (GROWLING) You must excuse him, Major. He doesn't like to remember anything about his honeymoon. (GASPS) Hendrik, don't take on so. Ruff! No wedding pictures, no honeymoon. (BREATHING HEAVILY) It's a phobia, whenever his wedding is mentioned he has a seizure like that. That is why we sent him to the sanitarium. Ja, ja, phobia, ja, very interesting case. I would like to know more about it. Oh, my angel, you soothe me, you soothe me. Please, stroke my head. Go on, stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke. Bah, do not coddle him. After all, he's a grown man. I'm tired. I want to go to bed. Yes, yes, it's getting late. You're right, Mama, Maria, get our things. 9:30 curfew, you know. Yes, Thomas. No, stay a while. You interest me very much. I want to get to know all of you better. Tomorrow, Major. I'm tired, and besides, we have to get up early in the morning. Yes, indeed, your divorce is the first case on the docket. 9:00 sharp. I am free tomorrow morning. I will be there. But there... There may not be any divorce. You forget my wife and I are going to talk things over tonight, aren't we, darling? Ah, yes. Yes, we are. Do not take it so seriously. You all look as if you were going to a court-martial. (YAWNS) I am getting sleepy. Good night. (BELL RINGING) The door! I'll get it, Mama. Probably another searching party. I will take care of it. (WHISPERING) What if it's Hendrik? What will we do? I'll fix him. It is a telegram. What is this? I was just telling them there she stands right in New York Harbor all lit up like this. Who? The Statue of Liberty. Liberty. Bah! Overrated. Thank you. So? It's from Aunt Sophie. Oh, Aunt Sophie. What does she say? Well, here. Read it. She says that she won't be able to come in from the country for a few days. She's ill. (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Oh, isn't that wonderful. What? Oh, what I mean is, in a few days Hendrik will be going back to the sanitarium and we'll have room for her. I would like to see this. Oh, you wouldn't be interested. Why not? Oh, you don't know Aunt Sophie. Ja, ja, Sophie, no. Mama, we really must go. Come along, Maria. Good night, Anita. Good night, Hendrik, Mama. Major, good night. I... I hope you all have a good night's rest. And why not? We all have clear consciences or haven't we? Come. Well, good night, Mama. Good night, Mother. Good night. Good night, Mrs. Woverman. Good night. Oh, Hendrik. Your room is over there, is it not? Why, yes, Major, but I'm going in to talk things over with my wife. Oh, ja, I'd forgotten. Good night. Good night. I have to wait till he's safely inside his room. Oh! Good night. Good night. Oh, hello. Hello. I... I'm just going in to get my slippers and my robe. Your robe? Yes, you know, something to wrap around to keep you warm. You mean it is cold in there? Cold? It's positively frigid. Brr, excuse me, Major. (DOOR CLOSES) You have lost weight. Yes. Love wears you down terribly. (DOOR CLOSES) (WHISPERING) He's still snooping around. We'll have to put on a show. CHRIS: Darling, let's not be foolish, let's not throw away our chance for future happiness. We're no good apart. You must see that. Let's start all over again. Without you I couldn't live. (WHISPERING) Say something. What'll I say? Well, anything. Say, "It's no use, Hendrik, "you're no good, you'll never be any good, you'll never change." It's no use, Hendrik, you're no good, you'll never... Louder. It's no use, Hendrik, you're no good, you'll never be any good. You'll never change. CHRIS: I will change, I promise you. I've changed already, hadn't you noticed? Don't cast me off like an old shoe, give your poor Hendrik one more chance. Remember what you said at our wedding? "For better or for worse, "for richer for poorer, till death do us part." You are lovely. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) SOLDIER: Detail halt! Sounds like a searching party. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) ZELLFRITZ: What is it? Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. We found the British flyer's parachute in this neighborhood. We must search the house again. How many times must we be disturbed by you dumbkopfs? My husband and I are trying to decide whether to be divorced or not. It is a very grave decision we must make, a delicate situation. There may not be any modesty left in your country, but this is Holland. Madame, you talk against the Reich. I talk against men without the manners of my grandmother's sow. There is no British flyer here. It is your responsibility, Major? It is my responsibility. Heil Hitler. ZELLFRITZ: Heil Hitler. (SOLDIER GIVING COMMANDS) Thank you, Major. Have you and Hendrik come to any decision? Not yet. Do not give in too easily. Fight him. Yes, Major. Maybe it would be better if you two were not together tonight? I'm sure it would be much better. Fine. Ja, ja, leave it to me. I will fix it, ja. Ja. (WHISPERING) You were wonderful. Magnificent. Terrific. Careful now. Well, you were okay. You will excuse the intrusion, but it is verboten to hold meetings of more than one person. It is also verboten to whisper. But, Major, we're just talking. Come, I will escort you to your room. Now, wait a minute. After all, a husband has some rights. We will discuss your rights in the morning, Hendrik. Can't I even kiss her good night? It is verboten . Out. Auf Wiedersehen. (DOOR CLOSES) (PANTING) Ja, ja, wunderbar. Madam... Madam, may I come in? Madam! Sorry, Major, it is verboten . Heil Hitler. Why doesn't he come? What could be keeping him? A fine mess we're in, all of us. If he doesn't show up, Major Zellfritz will certainly investigate and that means the firing squad. Oh, Thomas, don't say such horrible things. But he wouldn't do that to us, he couldn't. Something must have happened to him. I'm sure he'll keep his promise and go through with the divorce. I can't help feeling that we will all remember this day. We will, if we live. MARIA: Thomas, please. I should have stopped him when I saw him sneaking out of the house this morning. Uh, pardon, my name is Bietjelboer, Adolph Bietjelboer. I'm a lawyer. Do any of you need the services of a lawyer? I am a lawyer myself. ZANTEN: So am I. Oh, well, then perhaps you might need an assistant. BOTH: No. Well, I could carry your law books. I carry my knowledge of the law up here. I could carry your hat. No. Here comes the Major. Uh, what Major? Good morning. Good morning. But where's Hendrik? Oh he... He went out for a walk. Perhaps he got lost. Lost. In his native city? Ridiculous. Oh, Maria means that if he suffers another attack when he's out alone... Ah, but he's not alone, two of my men are following him. Two. Routine precaution. After all, we do not want the trial to be postponed, do we? THOMAS: Here he comes. Here...here he is. Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Mama, my darling. Glorious day. Did you have a nice walk, Hendrik? Yes, thanks for the escorts, Major. Not at all. I was afraid you might get lonesome. We were worried about you. Where did you go? You needn't have worried. I was in very good hands, thanks to the Major. Hendrik, did you make any stops, see anybody? No, we just walked. Did anything happen? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. Out. Woverman vs. Woverman. Courage, madam. Tomorrow you will be free. You're not going to help her get this divorce, are you? With that wolf around, don't worry. Before opening these proceedings, I would like to ask both these fine young people whether they have done everything possible to come to an amicable agreement and failed. Mr. Woverman? Your Honors, I'd like nothing better than to drop the entire matter and take her home with me. Do not be fooled by him, fight. You'll be much happier without him. JUDGE: And what have you to say, Mrs. Woverman? No reconciliation. No reconciliation. No. No. JUDGE: Well, Mrs. Woverman? My client refuses to consider a reconciliation. Let your client speak for herself. Your Honors, my mind is made up. My husband is... Is impossible. The case will proceed. Mrs. Woverman, how long have you been married? A little over a year. You were married in Amsterdam? No, I met my husband in Batavia. My father was an officer there. And when did you first become dissatisfied with your marriage? On my wedding day. Were... Weren't you being rather hasty? I will ask the questions, Mr. Woverman. I'm sorry, Your Honor. And what happened on that particular day, Mrs. Woverman? Tell the court what he did at the wedding ceremony. My husband knocked the minister down, poor man. Struck the minister? No, he fell on him. Hendrik was very drunk. Ha, ja, ja, boiled, ja. Well, I was excited and happy, Your Honor. It's not uncommon, Your Honor, for a man celebrating his wedding to be, uh, swept off his feet by the occasion. That was not an isolated instance. Is it not true that all the time you lived in Batavia... Oh, in the tropics everybody drinks like a fish. Like a minnow, maybe, or a barracuda, but certainly, not like a whale. Tell the court what happened on the boat back to Holland. He beat up the Second Officer. The poor fellow had to remain in his quarters the rest of the trip. ZANTEN: And that isn't all, your Honors. Oh, no, there's much more. Tell the court what happened on the fourth of April. Isn't it true that he broke down the door of your bedroom? Yes. Why? He... He wanted to come in. Why? ANITA: Well, must I answer that? ZANTEN: Certainly. He wanted a bottle of gin I had taken away from him. And did he not then beat you so that you ran from your room only to have him kick you down the stairs? Your Honors, I never would do a thing like that, I couldn't. ZANTEN: Brutally, with malice aforethought and intent to do bodily harm. I wouldn't harm a hair of her lovely head. ZANTEN: And she had bruises to prove it. I submit a medical report. (BELL DINGS) But, Your Honors, they are trying to make me out a beast, a dipsomaniac. Well, what else would you call a man who buys two bushels of peanuts for his pink elephants? Pink elephants, green snakes. Hmm, DT's, he had. Wait, Your Honor. Look at this fine, upstanding young man. Does he look to you like a confirmed alcoholic? Well, now I... Yes, look at him, Your Honors. A man debauched by liquor, eyes sunken and bloodshot, chin weak, the very picture of indulgence, in all the colors of moral collapse. Your Honors, is this a courtroom or an art gallery? You will paint no more pictures in this courtroom, Mr. Zanten. Mr. Woverman, what have you to say to all this? Your Honors, all I've got to say is, I forgive her. (DINGS) And what is your explanation of all these charges? Your Honors, we will answer these charges in order. Let him speak for himself. Your Honors, I am not a complaining man, but just look at me. Look at the suit I got on, nothing fits me. I've lost all this weight just worrying about her. But I still forgive her. Ask him about the Second Officer on the boat, Your Honors. What about that, Mr. Woverman? Oh, that... That was just jealousy, Your Honors. When I asked him what he was doing hanging around my wife's cabin all the time, he said he was just examining her sundeck. That's when I hit him. And what about the other charges? Are they true? Well, they are greatly exaggerated, Your Honors. Now, for instance, she fell down stairs, she wasn't kicked. Now, everybody in the family knew that. Isn't that true? (STAMMERING) Well, I was afraid. I was running away from him. It was dark. I couldn't see the steps. She couldn't see the steps. Anybody could tell from 10 feet away she'd been drinking. Is that true? Oh, no, no, Your Honors. I... I just had an alcohol rub. With Scotch? How do you know what happened? You weren't even there. (INDISTINCT MURMUR) Oh, what I mean is that he was so drunk he couldn't have known anything. You were drunk, weren't you? But, Your Honors, I was desperate. I just wanted to talk to her, that's all. Just talk to her. Look at her, Your Honors, isn't she wonderful? I've never seen a woman to equal her. The moment I saw her, I... Well, I knew I could trust her. I knew she'd never fail me. Why, I'd rather die than cause her a moment's unhappiness. I'm just terribly in love with her, Your Honors. (BELL DINGS) The court recesses and recommends plaintiff and defendant to discuss their differences privately in my chambers and I feel certain that they can come to an amicable adjustment in this matter. A fine mess you've made of things. I'm sorry, but I couldn't just sit there and have you call be a wife-beater. Well, why not? Do you think I'd lie about my life with Hendrik? But you were looking straight at me when you said it. Well, whom should I look at? Look at Zellfritz. This isn't a joke, at least, not to me. All right, what do you want me to do? Don't hinder my divorce, please. I've got to have it. But I'm not Hendrik. You can't get a divorce by proxy. Mother Woverman promised me that Hendrik would stand by the court's decision. I'd be free. Later I could make it legal. Don't you understand? That's different. Consider yourself a free woman. But, first of all, I've got to get out of here. There's somebody I must contact at the Cafe Savoy. I tried to see him this morning, but I couldn't lose those two Gestapo men. It's too dangerous for you to leave now. The Judge may call us back at any minute. I'll only be gone a little while. Cover up for me, will you? But wait until after the trial, please. Now, look, I've been clowning around because I didn't want to upset the family anymore than necessary, but I'm really on a spot. With a little good luck, you'll get your divorce from Hendrik, but with a little bad luck I'll be divorced from my head. Oh, that's right. I'd forgotten. Go ahead. I'll cover up for you. Get back as quickly as you can. Take care of yourself. Good luck. You are lovely. (CHUCKLES) Yes, sir. Is Gustav here? Yes, over there. Thank you. Is that table free? Yes, sir. I'll be right with you, sir. I would like a bottle of beer, please. Yes, sir. Any particular kind, sir? Bock beer. Yes, sir. (MUTTERING) Oh, I'm sorry. Why, you nearly broke my glasses. You might have blinded me, dumbkopf. (CLICKING TONGUE) I could sue you. You're a Gustav. I'm sorry, sir, but I serve so many people here I don't think I remember you. I'm in a jam, Gustav. Yes, sir. You've got to help me out. I'll risk it, sir. I'll take that. If you're collecting beer labels, that one's damaged. I understood you to say you were in difficulties. Perhaps we can be of more service to you than a waiter. Oh, that's very kind of you, sir, but I wouldn't dream of letting you pay my luncheon check. Gustav will take care of that as usual. Hmm? Of course. Fine, Gustav. Since my credit's good, perhaps I can have a sandwich too? I can bring you two pieces of bread. If you find anything between them it's a sandwich. (CHRIS CHUCKLES) Let me see your wallet. You don't seem to be in need of financial aid. Well, you see, sir, my wife is divorcing me. The trial is on now and that's just enough to cover the court costs, if I lose the case. Your name is Woverman? Yes, Hendrik Woverman. My wife's name is Anita. She's very beautiful. Woverman? Yes. I'm a Guldschreschts. Well, you don't look it. Yeah. I am Albrecht's son. You and I are cousins. Oh! But I don't think I remember seeing you before. Well, I've been in Batavia many years. Oh, wonderful. How are Uncle Peter and Auntie Kaatjo? Fine, fine, the children are fine, too. GULDSCHRESCHTS: Children? Your sandwich, sir. Thank you, Gustav. I, uh, haven't time to eat it now. I have got to get back to court. My wallet, please. Thank you. But I'm late, I tell you. Just a moment. The Judge will be furious and he'll give my beautiful Anita the divorce, And then where will I be without my beautiful Anita? And, besides, Major Zellfritz... Major Zellfritz knows you? He's quartered in my house. I thought Uncle Peter only had one son, Woritz. No, no, no. There's two new ones, twins. What, at seventy-two? Well you don't know Uncle Peter. There are certain food restrictions. I must make sure they are not violated. I'll take the sandwich. Uh-uh, mustn't touch. Attention. Heil Hitler. He's gone. With the sandwich? With the sandwich. Go get him. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Where is Mr. Woverman? I'm sorry, Your Honors, I... I couldn't hold him back. He... He simply had to go and have a drink. A drink? You should have notified me immediately. Suppose he does not return. Well, I'm sure he will, Major. As counsel for the defense, you have a plausible explanation of his absence, I assume. Well, Your Honors, just because a man goes for a drink it doesn't necessarily follow... (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) There he is, there he is. Oh. Oh! There's only one explanation, your Honors. Hendrik Woverman, you're drunk again. Just look at him, drunk. You said you'd only take one drink. (WHOOPING) Ja, ja, boiled. Ja! Your Honors, I appeal to you. Ladies and gentlemen, do I look drunk? (HICCUPS) (LAUGHS) Stinking, ja. (HICCUPS) This whole trial has been an injustice, because I love her. (GIGGLES) But I'm not your wife. You see, Your Honors. She doesn't even recognize me, and she'd dyed her hair just to deceive me. Why, there you are. My name is Adolph Bietjelboer. My little lawyer. Come on, Bietlebottom, defend me. Certainly. Do something. (CLEARS THROAT) Your Honor, in behalf of my client, I have some facts here that I... I object, Your Honor, I object. And he says he's not drunk. I'm sober as a judge. Order. As five judges. (DINGS) (BELL CLANGS) (RATTLES) Oh, my darling, don't divorce me. You will break my heart. Let's dance. This is what they're after. Hide it for me, will you? Oh, my darling, you will never know what you mean to me. There he is. Heil Hitler. What is this? This man started a riot in the Cafe Savoy. You bet I did. They wouldn't let me eat my sandwich. Tried to take it away from me. Food hoarders. There is no sandwich. LEADER: No sandwich? CHRIS: I ate it. This man bears close watching, Major. We have orders to take him into custody. He is dangerous. You're quite right. I know the case thoroughly. I'm personally handling it. But he started a fight. He assaulted Captain Scmutnik. He is apt to do anything. Last night in his own house after dinner we are in the living room... (YELLS) (MUTTERING) Just leave him to me. I will take care of him. (GROWLS) Your Honors, do you still deny my client her divorce? Divorce granted. Ow! (CLUNK) Where are you going, Liebchen? You did not give me a chance to congratulate you. Thanks, Major. Now that you are free, we are going to see a great deal of each other, no? (STAMMERING) No, Major, I am tired. The trial was very unpleasant. I want to forget, get away for a while. Hide from everybody. Oh, good. Hide from everybody, but not from me. You especially, Major. No, you can hide from everybody, but you cannot hide from Major Zellfritz. Where I plan to hide, it will take a bloodhound to find me. I smell good. Yeah, just like a dog. Well, it's about time you got here. You back there, if you want to eavesdrop, don't do it behind my back. Do it out here, do it out here. Well, young lady, what kept you? A man, of course. Why, I... Never mind. Don't tell me. You'd only lie about it. Stella. I want to thank you, Countess. Tut-tut. We've always needed someone around here to manage things. Stella, take Mrs. Woverman's coat and bag. I really do need the work, though. After all, when a woman's just been divorced... My dear, in this house we do not recognize divorce. We believe in love, even if it is no use to us now. I will never understand why a pretty girl like you wants to work for a lot of old harpies like us. Why, I explained that to you when I applied. I know, you want to hide. Well, you picked the right place. I am sure no man will ever dream of looking for you in this mausoleum. And now, if you will excuse me, ladies. (RINGING) Hello. Hello, Jan? This is Mrs. Anita Woverman. I want to speak to... To Mr. Hendrik, please. Oh, you mean your ex-husband. Yes, he's here. Just a moment, please. And you don't know where Anita is? We haven't seen her since the trial. There's nothing to worry about. I'm sure we'll hear from her very soon. I'm not so sure. She can't be depended on. I've got to see her right away. Your wife would like to speak to you, sir... Your ex-wife. Thank you, Jan. Can't be depended on. There's something going on between those two we don't know anything about. I wouldn't be at all surprised. Hello there. I am sorry I had to rush off the way I did. Where are you? I must see you right away. I need that little souvenir I gave you. Oh, I'm at 41 Emerstrat. It's the Woverman home, sir. Oh, and who are they speaking to? Anita Woverman. She's at 41 Emerstrat. Good. Notify Major Zellfritz at once. Yes, sir. Can we be alone? Well, I have a room of my own, but there are 30 ladies in the house. Thirty? Yes, and they're all charming, you'll love them. Well, I am afraid 30 is a bit too many for me. Please be discreet about this. I don't want the Wovermans to know. Yes, I'll be expecting you. Goodbye. Oh, oh, that was my husband... My ex-husband, of course. Will you send him in when he calls? Yes, if he can get past that wolf-pack alive. I have never seen anything like it. Just because her ex-husband is coming to visit her, you act like a lot of bees around a honey pot. Old bees. (BELL RINGING) Oh, uh... Now, don't get excited, girls. Don't get excited. Just because there's a man coming to the house we don't have to lose our heads. I'll answer it. I'll answer it. Heil Hitler. Heil who? Hit... Hitler! How do you do? We're twins. One of you would be sufficient. If you've strayed from your searching party, they were here this morning. This is not an official visit. I came to see Mrs. Anita Woverman. The ex-Mrs. Anita Woverman. I understand she works here. Mrs. Woverman is not reviewing the army today. Madame, either you will direct me to her at once or I shall report you to the Gestapo as an enemy of the state and a traitor to the Third Reich. (INHALES) Follow me. Nose twister, ja. Old buzzard, ja. Come in. Oh, Major Zellfritz. Out. (DOOR CLOSES) At your service, my dear. (CHUCKLES) How did you know where to find me? Did you think you could hide from Major Zellfritz? You will find that quite impossible, my dear. Oh, oh, Mimosa. I'm allergic to Mimosa. Oh, sheer medical nonsense. Exercise your willpower. You can overcome... (SNEEZES) Oh, you give in too easily. You should be very happy today, my dear. You're a free woman now. This calls for champagne, flowers, gaiety, music. Ja. (BELL RINGS) That must be Mr. Woverman. Is Mrs. Woverman in? Come in, young man. How do you do? I'd like to see Mrs. Woverman, please. I'm the Countess Oldenburg. You're her husband, aren't you? Her former husband. (WOMEN GIGGLING) I seem to be amusing the ladies. Well, you'll have to excuse them. We never have a man in the house. Never? This is an old ladies' home, Mr. Woverman. Oh! She has a visitor now, but it'll be a pleasure to disturb him. I'll tell her you're here. But, uh, you said there's never a man in the house. There isn't. Come, see for yourself. Well, I wouldn't want to intrude. You won't. This is a case where three's company and two's a crowd. Oh, there you are. I'm so glad you could come. I'm very happy to be here. Just what are you doing here? Well, I got lonesome for my beautiful wife. What nonsense is this? You forget she is no longer your wife. Oh, I haven't forgotten. That's just what made me lonesome. Does a divorce mean nothing to you? Legally this man is a stranger to you now. You must not allow him to kiss you. Well, I know I shouldn't, Major, but it's... Well, it's just habit, I guess. A very bad habit. Yes, very bad. You must try to break yourself of it, Hendrik. I advise you both to do so. Why are you not back at the sanitarium? Well, they haven't got room for me yet. The sanitarium's very crowded these days. Everybody's drinking to forget their troubles. Troubles? What troubles? We have taken over all of Holland's troubles. That's just what I mean. Hmm? Oh, ja. Ja, ja. (RADIO WHINING) (SNEEZES) MAN: (ON RADIO) Meat rations for this week, 100 grams per person. Those furnishing medical proof of anemia will be granted one extra meat ball, synthetic. (BELCHES) You are intruding. The lady and I wish to be alone. My dear, Major, Anita didn't ask for alimony when she divorced me, but I'm a man who feels my responsibility. I suggest you feel it somewhere else, not here. After all, she shouldn't be forced to work for a living. Oh, please, Hendrik, I really can't accept money from you. Oh, nonsense, you've been so kind. I insist that you take it. Oh, I really must take care of myself now. You go back to your mother. An excellent suggestion. And if I ever catch you within five miles of this place, you will be... And I have the power. COUNTESS: Searching party. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. You are Hendrik Woverman? Yes. You're under arrest. Arrest? For what? Treason. Treason? So you deny that you left the Peters Sanitarium and stole a gallon of denatured alcohol from the government stores and proceeded to drink it? Ja, he could do it, ja. Government stores, in times like these. Who knows but for the loss of that gallon we might now be in Moscow, perhaps. Ja, perhaps. Undress. Now, wait a minute. Ungrateful traitor, the Fuhrer feeds you and protects you and you betray him. Undress. Oh no, not in front of me, Captain. You're his wife, aren't you? Not anymore. The Judge made it illegal for him to undress in front of her. And besides, it's drafty in here. Outside. Outside! When did all this happen? This afternoon. Oh, but it couldn't have... Outside. Undress. But he was in court this afternoon. How come he be boiled in two places? Traitors are always in several places at the same time. Search that. Search the room. Just a moment, Captain. It could not have been this man. I know who it was. It was that Carl Bodoran again. He is always passing himself off for me trying to make trouble for me. He's hated me ever since I told him I was considering the Nazi Party. I assure you, Captain. Major, I know my job. Why are you so certain? I've had him under close surveillance. Very well, Major. So you were thinking of joining the Nazi Party? Well, you need good men, don't you? Are you prepared to betray your mother? Naturally. Your father? Certainly. Your sweetheart? Of course. And would you kill your own child if necessary in the Fuehrer's interests? Well, who wouldn't kill his own child for the Fuehrer? I would do more, much more. I would even give my Grandmother the hotfoot. Hotfoot? What is that? Well, you get some lighted matches and you stick 'em under their toenails. (CHUCKLES) Excellent. That is good. I shall have to try that myself. He qualifies, give him back his clothes. You report to Gestapo headquarters tomorrow in the morning. We will talk further. Heil Hitler. Heil, heil, heil, heil. (DOOR CLOSES) I no longer consider you a rival. Naturally she will prefer me. I am more dashing, much more beautiful than you. Yes, but my eyes are much prettier, deep blue. Yes, but when you were caught with your trou... I laughed. Huh? Did they find any... No, they were very nice. They're going to make me a storm trooper. Bah, he will never pass the physical examination. I hope they give me a cap just like the Major's. Besides, there is a mentality test, ja. Put down my cap. It's a very pretty cap, Major. Say, how do I look in it? Heel Hitler. Take off my cap. All right. If you're going to be stuffy about it. Now, look here, Woverman. I am completely out of patience with you. Really? And how do you think I feel about you? Hanging around my beautiful wife like a boa constrictor, our divorce hardly cold yet. You should rejoice that I take such an interest in her. She will have the protection of my rank. Oh, with her looks she can get herself better protection. A Colonel at the very least. I am more than a major. I have very high connections. My uncle is commander of this district, and Robert Niedermeyer, the marine engineer, is my cousin. Who? Niedermeyer. They're the two most important men in the city now. Niedermeyer, huh? Ja. Well, now I'm really impressed. Yes, I begin to see your point, you may be quite right. Right about what? About your going out with him, dining, dancing, fun. Yes, it will be quite all right. Oh, it will? Well, my darling, why should you deny yourself any of the pleasures the Major can give you? Who said I was going to deny myself anything? Now, don't try to console me. It will be excruciating thinking of the two of you together while I wander the streets, empty, desolate, heartbroken, but I must bear it somehow. Take her out, Major, let her be gay. I will be delighted. Well, that's very generous of you. I have an idea. Why don't you take her to the opera? Tonight it's Wagner, especially for German officers. With your influence, Major, I'm sure you can get a couple of tickets, if you phone right away. An excellent suggestion. The phone is right out there in the hall. Put down my cap! I'm sorry. (GROANING) (SIGHS DEEPLY) Hmm. Oh, it commences again. Phobia, ja. Thank you. You, lunatic, you. (GRUNTS) Here. Oh, you're magnificent. Now, what's the idea of shoving me off on that goose-stepping swine? It's just luck, Anita. That relative of his, Niedermeyer is a submarine expert. It ties up with some information I've got. Don't you see? Oh, you want me to play Mata Hari? Yes. Get him drinking, talk to him. Lead the conversation to the right point, and some day Holland will credit a statue to you. Hurry up, get your coat. Mmm. Well, why not? As I recall, Mata Hari had herself quite a time. Well, you don't have to have too good a time. And what was all that about your wandering the streets desolate and heartbroken? I meant every word of it. (DOOR OPENS) Everything is arranged. You will have to hurry. I will only be a minute. Major, let me get your coat. No. I will get it, you get control of yourself. No more kickups. Mueller, I told you to keep those bags in the front seat. What are those? Leaflets, you know, love letters for England. Well, good night. Have a gay time. Music, crowds... Oh, no. No crowds. I have a private box and a private dining room. Good night, Hendrik. Start wandering the streets, empty, desolate and heartbroken. What a night! How beautiful my leaflets will look fluttering down in the moonlight, ja. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) What are you doing here? It is after curfew. I'm lost. You don't happen to know of any streetcar lines along here, do you? The Germans are very funny. They shoot you if they find you out after curfew, then they laugh while you bleed. Nothing like a sense of humor. I think you better get in. The Germans, they only let two things go by, more Germans and beer. Well, thanks a lot, but I wouldn't think of putting you in danger. After all, it is my own fault. I think you better get in. Of course, if you insist. Now, look here. These may be war times, but that's no excuse for holding up an innocent cyclist. Shut up. Hello, Chris. Better close your mouth, you're drooling all over your tie. Keith! Why, we thought you were a goner. I saw your plane go down in flames myself. We surely thought you were finished. So did I. Where've you been? Gustav took care of me. I've been working for the Skopje Brewery. Look... I took the place of Klass Van Dongen, who skipped out. I have been driving his beer wagon. That is your identification from now on. I've got six children? I can't possibly support six children. Oh, you'll find it great fun. And, now, what have you learned? Nothing definite yet, but before the night is over I hope to have exactly the information I want. Splendid. One of our fellows WKF has a short wave set close by. I'll take you to him whenever you're ready. Fine. Now, put your cycle in back and we will get going, huh? Propaganda, press, phobia, ja. Nothing out! (SCREAMS) What are you doing here? A fine time to be getting home. No wonder I divorced you. How'd you get in? The Countess let me in to wait for you. Here, here, I'm not looking. Thanks. Now, did you find out everything? Not a thing. Were you alone all the time? No, Niedermeyer was with us. Niedermeyer? You actually mean Niedermeyer himself was with you? Yes, is that important? Important? What did he say? Tell me everything. Nothing. He just kept looking at me as if I were an extra ration card. No, no, he must have said something. Try and remember. A man doesn't sit there with a beautiful woman all evening and not say anything. Well, he said he would be finished his job in three days. Three days. Well, that's enough information for me to go ahead with. You sure I'm not keeping you? No, no, I'm not leaving. I can't meet my contact man until three o'clock. Did you ask him anything about his work? Well, I was just about to when he got a long distance call from Yselmunde. Yselmunde, Yselmunde! Three days, that's wonderful. That's it. Anything else? No, he left right after that. Well, that's enough. You see, we know he was supervising submarine construction, but now you've found out where and we'll soon take care of that. What a Mata Hari! Hey, what time did he get that telephone call from Yselmunde? Mmm, let's see, we were at the opera until 11:00. Then we had supper. I guess it was about 11:30. Eleven-thirty? Then Niedermeyer left, huh? Mmm. And you were alone with Zellfritz? Yes. Until now? Yes. Why? Why? Look, I may be only your divorced husband, but what were you doing with that German gopher for two solid hours? Why, you...you! Cad? Out of here. Now, listen. Two solid hours with Zellfritz. Why didn't I have you shot? Have you got a match? In the kitchen. CHRIS: Ever hear of Niedermeyer? Yes, submarine man, isn't he? He's assembling a fleet at Yselmunde. Say, that is news. The job will be finished in three days and that fleet will be scattered all over the Atlantic. Night patrol, come on. Come on. Short wave set's in this tool house. CHRIS: Spooky place. Where is the radio man? KEITH: He should be here. One of our planes is due over at three o'clock. Three o'clock? But it's almost that now. Well, where's the radio? I don't know, but we ought to be able to find it. Put out that light. Gestapo. That means our man's been arrested. Yes, get out of sight. I had a feeling those planes that shot me down knew I was coming and were waiting for me. But these fellows? Decoys. You know, like wooden ducks. (GESTAPO SPEAKING GERMAN) (RADIO WHIRRING) FLYER: (OVER RADIO): This is KRL calling WKF. Calling WKF, this is KRL. Calling WKF. KRL, WKF calling. How are you old boy? You're a few minute early tonight, aren't you? Oh, just a bit. Good flying tonight, high ceiling. Splendid. Visibility clear? Too clear for comfort. You'd better let me have your report right off so that I can wing it back. Right you are. Here it goes. Mostly quiet past few hours, except for some heavy railway traffic north of Amsterdam. What are they moving, troops or materials? Uh, can't say, I really don't know. Where are they bound for? Hard to tell. May have that information for you on your next trip over. Now? Now I am speaking as clearly as I can, old man. If you drop down a few thousand feet you will probably get better resul... Come in WKF. Come in WKF. What happened? Continue with your report, quickly. KRL, now listen carefully. The enemy is operating this station as a trap. Get out of here fast and report to your flight commander. Is that clear? No, it isn't. Who are you? Where is WKF? WKF has been arrested, probably shot. Now, stop asking questions and beat it. Their pursuit ships will be here any minute. But, look here... (RADIO STATIC) KRL? KRL, are you all right? (GRUNTS) Come in KRL. Too late, Chris. They got him. That's the last one of our boys they'll get with this radio. Morning, Stella. What have we for breakfast this morning? The same as we've had since the occupation. Practically nothing. Good morning, Stella. Good morning, everybody. WOMAN: Morning, dear. A man's coat. There's a man in the house. A man in the house... (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Well... Well... Oh, a nice large man, size 42. WOMAN: It must belong to Anita's husband. His identification card. "Klaas van Dongen. "Occupation. Beer wagon driver." How very strange. What is all this hanky-panky? Countess, Anita's husband's a truck driver. What's wrong with truck drivers? Look, moths. (GASPS) Moths nothing. They look more like bullet holes. He's in here. I'll deal with him. I saw him first. Let me go. No lollygagging in the doorway, and don't clutter up the hall. This is Anita's business. COUNTESS: Ladies, ladies, have we all descended to the level of peeping toms? Go and wake him up. Poke him, give him a poke. Never waken a man with a poke, he will be grouchy all day. Well, how would you awaken him? Well, you can sing to him or kiss him or tickle his feet. What if he's wearing shoes? Well, most men sleep with their shoes off, it's more comfortable. See? (GIGGLING) (SCREAMING) Oh, oh, my darling, I was having the most terrible nightmare. I was wandering the streets, empty, desolate, heartbroken... Oh, don't start that again. I told the Countess all about our phony divorce. Oh, you did? Certainly, I knew all along you two weren't married. Oh, you did? Oh, stop saying, "Oh, you did." Tell us how you got those bullet holes in your coat. Bullet holes? Are you hurt? No, I'm all right. The coat was on my arm, and besides, those Germans are rotten shots. ANITA: Why, they must be searching for you. I don't think they are, but our radio was destroyed and now I have to figure out some way to get my information through before those submarines get out. Isn't there any other way you can communicate? There's got to be. Why not? Do you know where I was last night for those two unexplained hours with Zellfritz? Now this is no time for confessions, I forgive you. We went to the airport to deliver those leaflets to a plane. The Major sends them out every night. Leaflets. Every night? Did you say every night? But that's wonderful... Leaflets. Then we could... Of course we can. What about Zellfritz's chauffeur? Why, Frieda has dishpan hands, but, oh, she's hmm with chauffeurs. I'll phone Zellfritz right away. Countess, is it all right if we have dinner in my room? Certainly. Anything for victory. Wait a minute... Go on go on, it's just a social invitation, like the spider and the fly. Yeah, but she's the fly. Oh, don't worry. He's got more swish than swastika. Ugh! Must you bring Mimosa? (STUTTERING) No. I want you to use your will power. Do not sneeze. Defy it. Uh... Ah! Port from Belgium. Ja. Cheese from Yugoslavia. Nice. Ja, ja, ja, ja. Wine from France. Fish from... (SNIFFS) Norway. Heaven protect the Fuehrer, he certainly gets together a wonderful table. No caviar? No, unfortunately, no caviar. I thought the Fuehrer promised you caviar by fall. Well, when the caviar was coming we were going. We expect it now in the spring. What year? Yeah, well, that's... Oh, where did you get that beautiful bird? We get the bird from all the countries. Is that everything we brought, Mueller? There's more champagne, sir, if you need it. Good, good. And now I suppose you're anxious to get back to kiss that pretty little kitchen maid. I am married, sir. Ja, ja, but not to the kitchen maid. No, no, ja, no. (LAUGHS) Ja. Before you go will you put a record on the phonograph? Yes, madam. (MUSIC PLAYING FROM PHONOGRAPH) And, remember, Muller, that even in the kitchen you represent the army. Yes, madam. Also remember, Muller, we have never yet been defeated. No, sir. (CHUCKLES) Ja. (CLEARS THROAT) Now, we will have a party. (CLEARS THROAT) Pork chops from Poland. Oh! Bacon from Denmark. (CHUCKLES) Boloney from Mussolini. He's in the kitchen. Oh! Frieda's got him. Shh. Yes, the bag is empty. Plenty of room. Now, here's what you write. Submarine fleet leaving Yselmunde in two days. Bomb at once. Sign it C-B-R. What did he say? Submarine fleet leaving Yselmunde in two days, bomb at once. Sign it C-B-R. Yeah. Now everybody got a pencil? Yes. Come on, now, no dawdling. I shudder when I think of Anita. As long as she keeps the music going there's nothing to shudder about. (MUSIC STOPS PLAYING) Maybe she's changing her tune. That's what I'm afraid of. (MUSIC PLAYING FROM PHONOGRAPH) It's a fine signal she arranged. Listen to that. Why can't she play something like, "When I'm with you I'm lonesome"? Won't that disturb the old ladies? Oh, no, they love music. And so do I. It makes me feel so... Oh, how shall I say it... Oh, put it in your own simple way, Major. Ah, ja. I have just the word for it... Devilish. (SLIGHT GRUNT) Vim and vigor from vitaminized vineyards. A lot of Vs. Oh, ja, for energy and ecstasy, drink champagne, the elixir of the elite. That's quite a sales talk. Oh, I was the best champagne salesman in Europe. Better than Von Ribbentrop? Von Ribbentrop! He was low man in my territory. Uh, a toast to the New World Order. Down with it. Oh, ja. Mmm. (SIGHS) I never thought I'd be involved in espionage. Write, don't talk. (BELL RINGING) Don't be alarmed, girls, that's probably Mrs. Van de Camp returning. She went to visit her nephew. You, open the door. Why do I always have to do everything? You're the youngest. I'm 53. You're 58, but you're still the youngest. Go open the door. (BELL RINGING) Let me in! Let me in. It was another man, he asked for Anita. Did you get his name? No, I wouldn't let him in. (BANGING ON DOOR) Keep working, girls. (BANGING CONTINUES) HENDRIK: Let me in! Here, here, here. Where is she? Where is she? Where... Who? My wife. I am her husband. Where is she? I'm Hendrik Woverman. Who told you, you were Hendrik Woverman? Huh? Why, my mother, of course. Your mother was kidding you. I'm Hendrik Woverman. Huh? Oh, yes, of course. My mother explained you. You know, I'm glad you're me, I don't want to be myself. Are you always like this? (CHUCKLES) I won't tell you. Now, look if you've come to bother Anita... Oh, no, no, I fixed everything. Fixed what? The divorce. I went to the Judge, he's a loyal Dutchman, he let me sign the papers, made everything legal, so want to tell her. Where is she? Hendrik, I love you. Oh, no, no, you mustn't. I'm already married. Well, that is, I was. Now, we're very busy. Oh, no, I can't leave, I don't want to leave. I came here to hide. They're after me. Who's they? The Gestapo. They're watching my house and the sanitarium too. Come here. Sit down. What have you done? Oh, oh, it happened on the Pulkastraat last night. I've been hiding near the canal all day. I was drunk. Hendrik! It's true, was also in a fight. (CLICKS TONGUE) Say if they catch me I can't possibly be Hendrik Woverman, can I? You're not so crazy after all. Then who can I be? No, wait a minute. Obviously I must be somebody, mustn't I? Here, this ought to fix it. Huh? This will identify you as Klaas van Dongen. You're a beer wagon driver for Skopje's Brewery. Skopje? Oh, no, no, never do, I don't like their beer. Don't quibble, Hendrik, remember those six little children you've got to support. Six little children? Really? Yes, daddy, so you can't afford to get in anymore trouble. Come on. (GASPS) Now stay sober. And, uh, this medal I got for my victory over the Boy Scout Organization with only three newspaper articles. I completely annihilated them. Ja, ja, ja. Oh, were you ever in a real battle? Oh, yes, indeed. I once dueled for my honor. Oh, who won? Shall we dance? (GASPS) (EXCLAIMS) Ja, ja, that's good. (CHUCKLES) (VOCALIZING) There's hardly enough room. Oh, you really should have a much larger place. You'd do better for yourself as, uh, my secretary for instance. But I don't type and I don't know short hand. Nevertheless, you would make an excellent secretary. (GASPS) (EXCLAIMING) No! (SNEEZES AND COUGHS) (CLICKING TONGUE) Oh! No, no will power... Oh... (GRUNTS) (SNEEZING) Ah! (EXHALES SHARPLY) You, Mimosa, you... (SNIFFING) (EXHALES) (GASPING) (SNEEZES) One at a... One at a time. (MUSIC STOPS) The music stopped. That's bad. You will have to give her a chance to change the record. But it doesn't take that long. All right, you go ahead. Keep him there for a couple of minutes and we'll have all this stuff back in the car. Don't forget the rear seat. Yeah. Hey, one of you huskies. Julie? Yes? Help me with this. Don't forget, Julie, put it in the rear seat. Right! Fake, phony... Ja. Hmm... Japanese. Ja. (KNOCK ON DOOR) (GRUNTS) Go away, Muller. Oh, I... I didn't know you had a visitor. How dare you break in here like this. I'll have you thrown out. Where's Muller? Oh, no, you don't understand. This is an emergency. I came to see if my wife... Your former wife. Yeah, my former wife could help me. The Gestapo are after me. The Gestapo? Why? It happened at the Pulkastraat last night. I've been hiding near the canal all day. I was drunk. Unusual for you. I was in a fight too. Oh, oh, Hendrik. Yes, Hendrik, but you've got to help me. Oh, Major, can't you do something? CHRIS: I'll do anything you say, but help me. Please, Major. For you, all right. First I must go to the airport. More little leaflets fluttering down in the moonlight? Ja, my tender tissues of truth. Then I am going to get you a nice quiet room in the sanitarium with bars. I get Muller. But first, the airport? ZELLFRITZ: Ja, ja, the airport, ja. (DOOR SHUTS) What is this, Muller, a retreat? Ja, I suspect she has a little Russian blood in her. Oh, ja, borscht eater. Ja. Get the car, Muller. We go. Ja. Never in the back seat, Muller. Always in the front. Airport, then the sanitarium. Open the gate, Major Zellfritz's car. I will be right back. Muller. Those leaflets will be in England tonight. And you? I'll be there in a couple of weeks. Say, Hendrik's back. He signed the court papers. You're legally divorced. May I be the first to propose? This is one thing I was prepared for. No. Yes. I have my answer all ready. No? Yes. Well, what is it? Yes! No! Darling, everything will be all right now. Well, I am not so sure, look! Ja, trouble maker, ja. Come. It's nothing. Hendrik Woverman. I have orders from the Gestapo to place you under arrest. But, Major, you promised to help Hendrik. Arson, murder... These small matters I could fix. But this crime, no! He will have to stand the court-martial. Well, what have I done now? You have committed an indignity upon our national honor. On a picture of the Fuehrer he has painted the spectacles and teeth of the Mikado. (HISSING) GESTAPO: Just look at that, desecrating our Fuehrer with the spectacles and teeth of the Emperor of Japan. The penalty for this is death. It is exactly 6:43. We are not going to shoot him until 7:00. That allows 17 minutes in which to give him a fair trial. Major Zellfritz will keep the time. You call that a fair trial? Look, I don't admit anything, but just to settle this thing can't I plead guilty to a lesser crime? Against the Fuehrer we cannot accept a lesser crime. But you said he was drunk. How can he be held responsible? Every man takes a drink now and then. I'll bet even he does. The Fuehrer is a teetotaler. The Fuehrer is a... A vegetarian. Be brave, admit your guilt. The brave die but once. Who's worrying about the second time? May I point out one all-important fact to the court? This happened between 2:30 and 3:00 o'clock night before last. To be exact, 2:42 and one-half. Well, he couldn't have been there because at that time he was with me. Does he come to see you every night? Well, we've just been divorced. Which makes your testimony invalid. You were his wife. Here are 30 witnesses who are not his wives. He cannot be acquitted by the sheer number of his prejudiced witnesses. We are not prejudiced. We are neutral. We don't care how he's acquitted. GESTAPO: Enough of that. (GAVEL BANGS) The accused will step forward. Hendrik Woverman, you have been found guilty. You are sentenced to be shot according to the martial laws. Promulgated, May 17th, sentence to be carried out at once. Bravo, eight minutes ahead of schedule. (CROWD WHISPERING) Go up there and ask to marry him before he's executed, quick. Gentlemen, one last request, I want to remarry my husband. You realize, madam, you will not have what I would call an extended honeymoon. Oh, I understand. GESTAPO: Well, then, why do you make the request? Well, you see, gentlemen. It's like this. I'm used to him. He's a habit, a very bad habit, but I'd like to spend the last remaining minutes as his wife. Well, why not? In seven and a half minutes, uh... We break off that habit, ja. (CHUCKLING) Call the Army Chaplain. Ja, Chaplain. Ja... (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) I'm sorry, my friend but last night we both had bad luck. Yours wasn't fatal. No, but my propaganda plane was shot down in the English Channel. With all your pamphlets? Yeah, my pamphlets. Drowned, ja. I've seen better looking bridesmaids. We are gathered here to join this... Wait a minute. Where's the marriage license? You will get it later, together with the death certificate. Proceed. Heil, Hitler. We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in the bonds of matrimony according to the laws of the third Reich. It is verboten to interfere with air raid precautions. Now, leave at once. Oh, we didn't mean to bother you, we're just so terribly afraid of the bombers. Are you sure, you're doing everything you can to protect us? Ja, ja, of course. Now, go, please. Oh, do not worry. He will not feel a thing. They're all expert marksmen, they never miss. Why? Because they stand so close? Ja! Where are the twins? Oh, what are those? Binoculars. What? Binoculars. I watch all night long. If I see enemy bombers, I just pull that. That? Yeah, that's the master air-raid alarm, sets off all the others. Oh, how wonderful. What? It starts all the alarms, then the anti-aircraft guns shoot up a barrage and we protect... (ALARM BLARING) (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) I'm frightened. Hold me tight. You great, big, wonderful man. ZELLFRITZ: Dumbkopf! Let go of me. I am Major Zellfritz. (WOMEN SCREAMING) ZELLFRITZ: Help me! Help me! Where are you taking me? (WOMEN PANICKING) (MAJOR SCREAMING) ZELLFRITZ: Let go of my medals... (MUFFLED) Let go of my medals. (MUFFLED SCREAMING) The master race, huh! Do you want his pants? No, throw 'em away. Major Zellfritz's car. Open the gates. At least I'm going on a honeymoon. I feel goose simply all over. Wait... Wait a minute. I'm married. But what's my name? Who am I? Mrs. Who? Mrs. Christopher Reynolds. Mmm, Mrs. Christopher Reynolds. I like that. I like that, too. There's more where that came from. (ENGINE STARTS) Heil Hit... Adolph! You lost your pants already? Out!
