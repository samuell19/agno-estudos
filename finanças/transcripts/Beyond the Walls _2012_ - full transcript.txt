Paulo's next. He is also one of us! He downed his glass like everyone! BEYOND THE WALLS Fucking hell! You have to help me here! Bloody Hell! Here... I don't even know your name. Ilir. What does it mean? Where's it from? Ilir, it's Albanian. The Mafia? OK, I see... you've got your head full of stereotypes. Sugar? Yes, thanks. It means freedom in French. - Can I bite mine too? - Sure, but have some water first. Drink. You've got to dilute your hangover, trust me! - Finish it! - No, I can't. Trust me, you need to get rid of the toxins. Or you'll feel like shit all day. Good... drink, drink... swallow. Don't choke yourself. - I can't anymore - Thats fine. - Go, if you have to - No, it's OK. Was that your girlfriend? No. No, it wasn't... well yes, but not really. Fine, say no more, I get it. What do you mean? You're still trying to figure it out, aren't you? No. Yes, I mean... you could say that. - I can't remember last night - That's probably a good thing. - Why? - Never mind... No, go on, tell me... We snogged, you wanted to suck my cock. - Oh, no no... no - Oh yes... yes you did. But it's OK, it's no big deal. I'm really sorry. Hey, I was joking. Where were you? Don't you have stuff to do? I looked for yo. u everywhere, you could have called. I was out of credit... my phone battery was dead. Where did you sleep? I don't know anymore. I can't remember, I don't know... Was it a guy? - Have you got one size up, or not? - I'll be with you, madam. You promised you'd stop. Tell me the truth. There, that's the truth. Hi. - Alright? - Yeah, you? Yeah, good... good. I've got your T-shirt. Thanks. Thanks, that's nice of you. I washed it. I hope so. - Do you want something to drink? - Yes. I'll have whatever... a beer... a beer. - It's fine like that. - OK, thanks a lot. - See you soon. - Bye. - You're not having one? - No, I'm at work. But if you feel like it, I'm doing a concert on the 30th... If you have nothing else on, if you feel like it... Well, do what you want. Isn't it possible before that? No, because... it's not my decision. I'm going out with some mates. - Oh no, not tonight. - Why, what's up? I just wanted you to stay here with me. Me too... another time? But you can't go out with that look. Where should we go? Sorry, sorry... I'm sorry. Let me see... I really went for it, sorry. Can I taste? You want, too? Don't resist. OK? Just breath in, OK? Do you love me? Yes. It doesn't feel like it. You didn't even ask me how my meeting went. - I did. - No. OK, so I forgot. How did it go? It's too late now. Sorry I forgot. I had other things on my mind... You always have other things on your mind. So what's up now? We're going to start this again? This is no good. You know it. What? What's going on? What did I do? We need to talk, you need to tell me the truth. We need to talk! We do nothing but talk, bla bla bla all day. Enough now, no? Can I meet him? I'm going to bed. We should hook up again soon. I miss you already. I love you. I want you to leave. I've had enough. I don't understand. We're good together. How can you say that? It's been months since we've done anything. Stop pressuring me all the time like that! Get out! Get out! - What, right now? - Yes. Take your stuff and get out! - No way! - Oh, yes. Can you put me up? We've seen each other twice. We hardly know each other. We've seen each other three times. Three times, if you prefer, but that changes nothing. Where can I go? - Your parents? - They live in the boonies. Don't you know anyone who can put you up for one night? I'd never beg you if I did. Now is not a good time for me. - Its burnt. - Give me two minutes. Who is he? Elina. This is Elina. She's my sister! Have you known each other long? He's never mentioned you. Leave him alone. He's a friend. That's all. - I'm only asking. - Mind your own business, OK! What's wrong? Nothing, don't worry. I'll clean up. - No wait I'll... - It's fine! Leave that, I'll do it. - What's the problem? - I want to be alone. - He's here, isn't he? - Leave me alone! As you wish. Thanks. No, I don't agree. For tonight, just picture a line here, a frontier between us. Are you punishing me? Come on, move, get out of here... There! You're all I've got left. What? You're all I've got left. - Don't exaggerate... - No, it's true. Listen, I'm happy to help you out, but... I prefer things to be clear, for me this is just for fun. What do you mean, just for fun? What happened to me is your fault. Come on, we had fun cuddling for a few minutes. That doesn't mean I have to turn my flat into a YMCA. Take care of me. Take care of me. Blow jobby? What? Blow jobby? No, no blow jobby now... Blow jobby! Honestly what a word, blow jobby? If you want, I'll swallow. Where am I... I don't know anymore... Right, I'm going to stop this, I've lost track... Thanks... thanks a lot. Come here. No! Wait, just come here, like this. - Time to sleep, OK? - Yes. Be a good boy. Are there lessons on Saturday? It's so the kids don't forget their origins. One of my mom's great ideas. Can you wait here, please. I won't be long. What are you doing? - Getting attached to you. - You prick. We should play music together one of these days. Yeah, if you like. Bass and piano isn't great. Can't you play another instrument? I can play flute. Idiot. - No, honestly, it's true. - Yeah, right. And singing? Can you sing? I'm flying off to the sun, towards days full of fun, I'm flying off to the sun, to give you advice second to none. OK, so you can't sing. No, stop, please... It tickles. Let go. Do you love me? Not at all. Go for it. Don't forget, my eyes are closed. I can't take it anymore, I'm on the edge, here. - You've never taught anyone, have you? - For fucks sake. - I'm not the worst. - I can't believe you! I like you a lot, but you really exhaust me.
