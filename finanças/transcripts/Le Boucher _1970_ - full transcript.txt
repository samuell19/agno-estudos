THE BUTCHER To the inhabitants of Tremolat, Périgord What about the Périgueux sauce? Get on with it! Out of the way! We have work to do I hope it's your best beef, Popaul! I killed it myself. If it's not good I'll cut my tongue out! We'll eat it with sauce! I'll carve How about that? Why are you laughing? It looks so good, that's all Not like in the army When they did have a bit of good meat... ...they cooked it like leather As father of the bride, I'm expected to make a speech It won't be long, because I don't want to talk rubbish... ...and have my son-in-law correct my mistakes When your daughter marries a teacher... ...you have to watch your grammar Still, I know enough to say how this marriage pleases me... ...because I'm very fond of young Léon He taught our youngest to read and write... ...he's a local lad and I'm sure he'll make my girl happy You can be sure of that! Funny things, weddings Don't you think that weddings are funny? Well, yes, everyone has a good time - Things turn sour afterwards - Not always Well, yes, everyone has a good time - Things turn sour afterwards - Not always Some of my army pals were married They weren't at home Don't be evasive They couldn't be sure Miss Hélène, may I drink champagne? Ask your mother She says I can if you say so - All right; do you like it? - I've never tasted it Not bad - You accept responsibility - Yes, I like that He likes you; all the kids do, you know Well, I like them, too By popular request, I shall sing you a song The Little Isle of Capri Why won't you dance the waltz? - You dance too well for me - You're not so bad I haven't danced much in fifteen years The people are nice here, much nicer than elsewhere Why did you Join the army, then? I'd have been all right here... ...but there was one rat among these nice people: my father - How long have you lived here? - Ten years; I knew your father well Wasn't he a real swine? He was a butcher He wasn't even a good one; he killed badly and chopped meat anyhow Weddings... my mother may have been happy on her wedding day... ...but what she went through after, poor thing - Why did you never come back? - To see the old man? No, thank you I came back for my mother's funeral seven years ago I was on holiday in Paris then You holiday there, Parisians holiday here; that's logic That's logic! I'd liked to have seen you there I wouldn't have minded; I'd have been a nurse We had good times, but... The rice was good, wasn't it? The rice was all right, but the rice fields were treacherous - You smoke in the street? - Are you shocked? No, but it's unusual to see a woman smoke in the street It's more hygienic than smoking indoors Yes, that's logical You're fond of logic, aren't you? Well, I was fifteen years in the army The army makes you appreciate two things you haven't got: logic and liberty Do you live above the school? - How long have you been headmistress? - Three years You're young for a headmistress It's because I tread carefully Are you fond of meat? I ask because if I get a good animal some time... ...I could bring you some escalopes or choice Joints You know, some animals are better than others What a dream... a butcher to choose your meat for you How wonderful While I think of it... do you have to learn to be a butcher? Yes, you do really... and that's what's funny I was a butcher with my father and in the army, too I've always been a butcher, in Algeria, in Indo-China... a butcher Soldiers have to eat Yes, that's logical Well, here you are; I'll go home now Thank you for seeing me home, Popaul - You look fed up, Léon - I'd rather have stayed at home Not tired of married life yet? I hope you'll be very happy You'll see how nice it is to go home to your wife after work I'm going home to lunch You've had five minutes extra break in honour of Monsieur Hamel's wedding Are you deaf, you two? Riri's father told him that the postman said... ...a dead woman has been found in Saint-Alver woods He breathed an air of grandeur... comma... ...a majestic resolution... comma... ...a certain profundity... ...by which... ...even the most vulgar mind... ...must be impressed Honoré de Balzac... I'll write the name for you Do you know who Balzac was? A writer He was a nineteenth century novelist... ...who portrayed the society of his time But I'll tell you about that later Hearing the door of her room open suddenly, Hélène... Don't laugh Just because it's my name Hélène rose from the divan, but she saw the marquis... ...and gave a cry of surprise He was changed almost beyond recognition His pale face... ...had been bronzed by the tropical sun... His pale face... ...had been bronzed by the tropical sun... ...giving him a poetic appearance He breathed an air of grandeur, a certain profundity... ...by which even the most vulgar mind must be impressed I don't want to disturb you I know I shouldn't call in school hours I've brought you a leg of lamb It's a special one, look Perhaps you'll help me collect the books I used to sit there Were you a good pupil? I was fine at French and history, but no good at problems about trains Our teacher wasn't nearly as nice as you, the old hag Her name was Vachin; cow by name and cow by nature - You mustn't insult my colleague - Colleague or not, cow she was They'd have heard about Vachin sooner or later She'd never have let the butcher deliver during school hours Have you got a fridge? Wait, I'll walk as far as the baker's with you Come and eat the lamb with me tonight, if you don't fear being compromised - What's wrong? - Nothing. You took me by surprise It would lose half its savour if I ate it alone Well, will you? What time shall I come? About seven, after I've marked the books I'm not very busy these days I do the buying and slaughtering; my assistant runs the shop It's different in the autumn, in the game season That was a policeman from Périgueux About the crime at Saint-Alver The Gaillotin girl was found stabbed to death Two weeks ago Jean danced with her But I've not seen her since I expect some tramp did it I'm sorry, I was miles away The police will be here for ages I expect you're right It'll give us something to talk about, but still... Will you put it on my account? - Am I too early? - No, come up, the door's open Punctuality is the politeness of butchers As Louis XIV said - I've nearly finished - So I am too early No. Would you like a drink? I can do without a drink; I've drunk enough in my time Why not sit there? I'll be five minutes - It must be fun to teach kids - Yes, it's a worthwhile Job You smoke "Gauloises"? What do you think of this? It was so hot the air was like an overcoat Well... is it good? We could eat early, then go to the Sarlat cinema Yes, but I don't like war films, they're disgusting I made war for fifteen years; you must be stupid to enJoy war films - Why did you stay in the army? - Because I am stupid I've seen a few things... it wasn't pretty It's a comedy film tonight. Shall we start cooking? Downstairs to the kitchen? I'm proud of my little kitchen Did you see the police today? It seems a girl was stabbed at Saint-Alver They haven't found any clues - How long to cook it? - Half an hour will do No garlic? Never with lamb! - Shall I make my salad? - Yes, but you're my guest Are the eggs hard-boiled? What sign were you born under? Libra, the Scales; that's why I swagger. I was born on 6th October I'm Scorpio - That's a bad sign - All signs are good Do you need anything else? Just a small knife My van's not very elegant to drive to Sarlat There's my little car What's so funny? You and your little car Haven't you seen me drive it? A small escalope, please Congratulations on the examination results My young brother would have failed, but for you They're back It seems they're on the trail of some tramp Maybe they've found a new clue It's dreadful; think of that poor girl I've seen corpses, head in the muck, cut in two, mouths gaping Piled three or four high, kids with their eyes out I've seen an old woman like her cut to pieces I've seen my pals rotting in the sun, eaten by vermin Yes, war is horrible, but it's a Job to be done... ...whereas a murder like this is savagery We counted bodies by the lorry-load Three francs. On your account? There they go again Monsieur La Hire, the school fête's on 22nd October Can I come and ransack your costume collection? You may have what you like You said I could Join in. I love dressing up and playing the fool - And for you, Madame Tirant? - I've come for my minced beef What about a nice steak? It would restore your teeth Will you come mushrooming with Charles and Lisette this afternoon? - What time? - About four I may still be working then Join us if you can, in the wood behind the grottoes I may still be working then Join us if you can, in the wood behind the grottoes How's this for a haul? I can sniff out mushrooms Come and see the mushrooms Popaul's found Do you think you've done enough for one day? I like to watch you with the children Can we go and play over there? You know, Miss Hélène, there's one thing I've noticed School teachers are usually known by their surname I never knew Vachin's first name... ...but with you it's the opposite, always Miss Hélène Everyone calls you that. What is your surname? Do you mind me asking? Not at all, why shouldn't you know my surname? May I ask you another question? But it's even more personal Ask, anyway You needn't answer I think I know the question; I promise I'll answer Well, I'll take the plunge, then Why is it you haven't a lover? Because I don't want one Yes, I understand... ...but the question is: why not? Because I had a very unhappy affair ten years ago I was deeply in love with a boy who was everything I wanted Then, after some months, he Just left me Well, that... ...that made me physically ill and it took me a long time to get better That's why I came here; now I'm very happy I don't say you're not happy, but still it's not normal It's quite normal It's not difficult to do without things But that's awful I'm not in the least troubled, you know I love the children as if they were my own You don't convince me And anyway... I know what I'm doing It's fine that people meet, fall in love... ...make love and so on... ...but I don't want to take any more chances I know that it's not always so marvellous... ...but never to make love can drive you crazy Making love can send you mad, too So it's irrelevant Damn it all, if I kissed you, what would you say? I wouldn't say anything But I ask you not to Are you giving me a present? What for? What's the date? It's my birthday - How handsome you are! - It doesn't take much You must understand the instincts, the feelings... ...even the intellect of Cro-Magnon man... were really human Only his problems of subsistence differed from ours What does subsistence mean? Keeping alive He began to draw Do you know what desires are called when they rise above the savage state? Aspirations If Cro-Magnon man hadn't survived in his world, you wouldn't exist What if Cro-Magnon man came back? I don't know. He might adapt himself to our conditions He might die I don't want him to die; I'm sure he was very nice Has everyone brought lunch? I've got some chocolate rolls if anyone is still hungry I'd like a chocolate roll Rain? Of course not, the sky is clear It's blood! Don't move; I won't be long I'm a police officer I'm afraid I must ask you a few questions I've come down on the night train, haven't slept a wink This your classroom? Young for a headmistress, aren't you? They say you're a wonderful teacher Périgueux's a bit out of its depth with these murders They've called us in to cover themselves Sadistic crimes are always a problem So you found the body I read your statement; no point in going over it The kids must have been shocked, especially the little girl I'd like to ask you... Interesting point from the autopsy: she wasn't raped Not raped... that's extremely unusual Usually... well, she can't have been dead long when you found her Any unusual noises... ...before the blood and all that? You didn't have the feeling that someone else was there? You were going to say something I'd been giving my attention to the children on the path down - The kids heard nothing? - Not as far as I know We'll check that later. You say you approached the body... Tell the infants to come in, too. Monsieur Hamel may be away today Did any of you who were on the outing yesterday... ...hear or see anything unusual? Now don't invent anything, tell me the truth They're not liars - Can we talk somewhere else now? - In the yard Charles, I leave you in charge; I won't be long Keep quiet, like Miss Hélène said! I congratulate you on your composure; it must have been terrifying I don't want to keep you, but think carefully Have you any idea, however vague, that might put us on the track? There's no doubt that in this area, not necessarily locally... ...there's a madman at large, do you understand? Yes, but I can't help you Between ourselves... her husband... Léon Hamel... ...could he have done it? That's unthinkable If you knew what we see, if you knew human nature... You go to your pupils and I'll stew in my own Juice Can I use your phone? Our line's through the post office and that's not open yet - Every modern convenience - It's the school phone, not mine You're living in the Middle Ages - Every modern convenience - It's the school phone, not mine You're living in the Middle Ages Not too squashed-up, children? I'll give you something to draw Can I come up? I've a surprise for you I've brought it from Périgueux Come up Cherries in brandy, I hope you like them Big ones, too; none of the rubbish they sell in cafés Are you all right? I'm a little tired. Shall we taste them now? Sit down, I'll find some dishes This business is getting you down They're the best I've ever had They're good, aren't they? This is the first time I've seen you out of sorts Don't worry, Popaul, you're too kind I'm not completely insensitive, I know you've had a shock And poor Hamel must be in a state He couldn't work today So you took his class, too You must take a holiday. If you fall ill... No, I'm very strong If you had seen her I thought of the corpses you talked about They couldn't have been worse Don't think of her like that Picture her on her wedding day, when we became friends She was a little tipsy, flushed... You're tired, and now you're crying Dry your eyes I saw some lambs at Périgueux; lovely Joints they'd make I'm sorry, I can't help it You know what? I'll redecorate this room for you Don't cry any more It's over now - Got a light? - That's better That's my lighter Of course. It works beautifully Are you starting again? You're crying differently now What shall I do? Go away? Please stay! I want you to stay I loved her so Do you know Paul Thomas? I had to trouble him, like everyone else. May I walk with you? This is a dreadful business No clue, no lead of any sort The same sadist did both murders; the same wounds, no rape If I don't stop him, he'll do it again The same sadist did both murders; the same wounds, no rape If I don't stop him, he'll do it again Interrogations get us nowhere; we can't lock people in their homes We can't even be sure it's someone local And the weapon... probably a flick-knife Everyone has them in the country I'm going to Miss Hélène's - Is it nearly finished? - Just the ceiling to do Do question 5 on page 72 "A train leaves Orléans..." You'll never learn if I set you easy problems - My place is a shambles - It'll be nice when it's finished See you tomorrow - Tomorrow's Sunday - See you on Monday, then Poor chap I'm going shopping in Bergerac Get to work, Charles; no slacking, both of you She's always setting me problems about trains Could you help me? I've spilt paint on the carpet You need spirit Where is it? You know everything Since last year... ...she's been giving me train problems Where are clean rags? In the little table drawer Shall I read you my problem? Don't count on me "Another train leaves Toulouse at 14.43..." Any idea of the distance between Orléans and Toulouse? I never could understand those problems I must be going. I've done the first coat, now it must dry Shall I put the ladder away? Do you know another girl's been murdered? At Bergerac this time Didn't you hear? I said another girl's been found murdered I'm not surprised. Do you think it's going to stop all of a sudden? That's true, you're right, Popaul Another murder? Never mind that, have you done the problem? I couldn't - Don't you understand the principle? - Not at all You add together the distances travelled by each train... It's double-dutch to me One train travelled 367 kilometres... Charles, did you look for something in this drawer? No, Popaul looked for a cloth to clean the carpet - It's late, you're tired - Tomorrow's Sunday Anyway, you've got the hang of the problem now Let me in, I want to talk to you Just for two minutes... please Just a couple of words I've got a headache. Come tomorrow It's important now Really, I'm not very well. Wait till the morning I switched off the light. I got in through the woodshed Keep still and listen I saw you found the lighter So you knew it was me When I discovered I'd lost it, I bought another in Périgueux I knew you'd notice if I didn't have it But that was a waste of time since you'd already found it This is what I killed them with, this knife I can't help myself, it's like a nightmare I can't breathe until I've done it, until I've stuck my knife Trust me Don't speak I know it's finished between us, my shame is terrible I couldn't bear to face you; I know I horrify you And I can't bear that Miss Hélène, help me See, I've killed myself. Help me Stay where you are, don't move Let go Press hard. I'm going to take you to hospital Don't tell them why; don't tell them who I am Hurry I'm losing all my blood Don't talk I must talk to you now I spent my nights thinking of you I spent nights outside the school, looking at your window You were the only one When I saw your eyes... ...I forgot everything I forgot who I was I lived only for you Please don't talk You can't stop me I want to take you in my arms I would have liked to have been with you always, to love you... ...to protect you, to know you needed me If I could have taken you to a desert island... How far it is I have so much blood It keeps flowing I know about blood, I've seen so much... ...so much blood flowing When you were there, there was no blood I didn't think about blood I don't know if I can hold out My blood keeps flowing Once, when I was little, I fainted at the sight of blood Have you noticed the smell of blood? All blood has the same smell... ...the blood of animals and the blood of men Some blood is redder than others... ...but all blood smells the same How far it is Keep quiet, we're there Kiss me He's dead When the lift stopped he cried "Miss Hélène", then he died You're tired; go home. We'll see about the details tomorrow
