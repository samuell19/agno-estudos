- I thought you and Mark were havin' lunch today. - He said he had to go to work. - He's working on a Saturday? - Maybe. Or maybe he's shopping for a special gift. We've been dating three years now. - And you think he's gonna propose? - Well he said he had to talk to me after Christmas and he's been acting really weird lately, so maybe. - Oh. - You're not excited for me? - Of course, but you guys are just so different. - I know he doesn't love Christmas. But you know what they say, "Opposites attract." - They you say that about accent walls and other- - Mark. - Speak of the Mark. - Hey. - Hey, just wonderin' if you wanted to go to dinner tonight. - Oh, I'd love to. But Lindsey and I are decorating, remember? I thought you were gonna come over. We could order takeout. - All right, you know I hate decorating. That's why you decorated my place for me. What about tomorrow night? - Tomorrow, tomorrow. Well I've gotta go and collect and wrap the gifts for the toy drive and help decorate Main Street, collect the ornaments for the neighborhood gift exchange and then bake cookies for the bake sale. I thought you were gonna come over and help. - I'd just get in the way. What about Monday night? - We promised to decorate for the fundraiser. - No, you promised. How about Tuesday night? - What's going on? You're still taking me to the fundraiser on Friday, right? - Look, I was just hoping to have some alone time. - Oh, okay. We can have dinner, just the two of us on Tuesday. - Okay, I'll see you then. - Okay. Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday. I think it's Tuesday. I think it's gonna be Tuesday. - Tuesday. Have you heard anything about the manuscript you submitted? - Oh, I got the latest rejection letter last week. - Keep trying. Why don't you write about Christmas? - I do love Christmas. - Almost obsessively. You do too much, Kat. - Aw, do not. - Mom told me you volunteered to bake for the bake sale again. - Well you know me, any excuse to decorate cookies. - She said you joined the city planning committee to help with Christmas decorations. - Well they needed the help. - And you've committed to the toy drive again. - Imagine those children's faces when they open their gifts. - Aren't you already in charge of their Christmas fundraiser? - Well it's for the kids. Don't you remember the magic of being a child on Christmas morning? I don't want any kid to miss out on that. - I get it, but I worry that you're jeopardizing your own Christmas. - Christmas is a time of giving. - But you give way too much, Kat. - I can't say no if someone needs my help. - That's your fatal flaw, you can't say no. - I can so. - Remember when you tried to get out of our neighborhood ornament exchange? - That was different. - And now you're doing all the collecting and distribution for them. Exactly my point. - 'Kay. Well I guess I feel like I'm Santa's little helper. - An overly-caffeinated one who can't say no. - Ooh, a peppermint mocha with whipped cream and a candy cane sounds great right about now. Hmm? Hmm? Hmm, hmm, hmm? - I know what you're doing. But I can't say no to that. - Oh, wait 'til you see my dress for the Christmas fundraiser. I got the seamstress to make Mark a matching bow tie and vest. For Mark. - I'm sure he's gonna love that. - Oh, you made it. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. - So am I. - Come in, come in. It's cold. - Yes, it is cold. - Want me to take this? - Thanks. I'm glad to be here. All right. Where is she? - Uncle Hunter. - Hey. Oh my Lord. What'd you eat? - I don't know. - Rocks? - No. - Iron. - Mm-mmm. - Yes. - No. - Okay. How'd you get so heavy? There she is, my favorite niece. - Your only niece. - Yes, you're gettin' so big. - I'm 10 now. - Whoa. You are so old. I should've brought you a walking cane. But instead, I brought you that. - Thanks. - Oh, I got you somethin' else. There you go. - Thanks, Uncle Hunter. - How about you get ready for bed, sweetie? - She's not in the baby dolls anymore. - Not really. - I tried. - Thanks. - You hungry? - Starving. Yes. - Come on, let's feed you. Are you sure you're gonna be okay living here and working for our tiny TV news station when you're so used to the Big Apple? - Hey, Rainbow has its charm. Besides, I wanna be here for you and Charlotte. You know, I'm sorry he left. - It's okay. It's tough, but we'll get through it especially with you here. Thank you. - Love you. - Thank you. - Okay. That's great. - Oh, looks like it's leanin' a little bit to the left. - No. It looks straight to me. - I'm just kidding. It looks fine. But the ribbon should be on top, don't you think? - What? No. The bow always goes at the bottom. You're messing with me again. Okay, got it. - Do you mind? Well I heard they have the best cookies in town, but I didn't realize it was so tough to get through the door. - Oh, pardon me. The door, kind sir. - Thank you. - Hope the door doesn't hit you on the way in. You said you wanted to talk to me? - Hey, thanks for decorating and you didn't have to do that on your lunch hour. - It's my pleasure. Just a reminder: I need to leave early today to collect donations for the toy drive, but I'm gonna come in early tomorrow to make up for it. - Actually, I need to talk to you about something. - Sure. - I need you to go to New Mexico for a new account. - But we're weeks away from Christmas. I'm in charge of a fundraiser this Friday and then I need to deliver toys on Saturday. I volunteered to be Mrs. Claus. There has to be someone else who can do it. Can you ask around? Please? - Don't worry. I'll find someone. - Wonderful. - Listen, kiddo. I gotta let you go. - You're firing me? But I've been here five years. Right before Christmas? - Katrina, you're a hard worker and extremely talented. But every Christmas, you get busier. You're here, but clearly your mind is elsewhere. - He fired me. - Yeah. - Well maybe this'll give you time to work on your books. - You know what? Have you heard of income? I need it. - Maybe you can freelance or even check out the local paper and see if they need some help. - Maybe. This day could not get any worse. - Hey, I'm sorry about your job. - Thanks, but I'm not complaining. We finally get some alone time together and I made some extra cookies just for you. Now don't lemme forget. Before you leave, I've gotta give you a bow tie and vest that you're wearing for the fundraiser. - About that. - And we need to be ready to leave at 6:00 sharp. - The party doesn't start 'til 7:00. - I know, but we can't be late. - Look, Kat. - I just want everything to be perfect. - I know you always want everything to be perfect. But- - But what? - I can't do this anymore. - What are you saying? - Kat, you love Christmas and that's great for you, but I am so tired of hearing Christmas songs two months before Christmas. - Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year. - But you take it to an extreme. You send cards to over 100 people you haven't seen in years. - Well that's why I send them, to keep in touch. - And then there's no time for me. Us. - And I wanna spend more time together. Sometimes you don't like doing things that I love to do. - You're right. We're too different. This is never gonna work. - That's not what I meant. - Katrina, I wanted to wait 'til after Christmas, but I can't. I need a break. - Oh. Okay. Well you don't have to come to the parties this weekend. - No, no. I need a break from this, from us, from you. - But I thought you were gonna propose. - What? No. I should go. - No! No! - Can't believe he broke up with you before Christmas. - I don't know if I'm more upset about Mark breaking up with me or me breaking Grandpa Marks' Santa. - Why don't we go grab some pizza? - I'm too depressed to leave the house. - Okay, it's a girls' night in. Want some hot cocoa? I can order some food while we watch a nice romantic Christmas movie, hmm? - Yeah. Let's watch what I will never have. - Okay, no movie. Hot cocoa comin' up. - Another rejection. Another rejection. Figures! - "Things will get better," isn't that what you always say? - No, I never said that. Nothing gets better ever. - Why don't you write something about Christmas? It might cheer you up. - I'll write something about Christmas all right. I'll write something about Christmas. - I'll leave this right here for you. - "Just say no to Santa. Just say no to ho, ho, ho." - Maybe we should put on a movie. - "Pressure of relationships." - This is interesting. Not what I expected but very entertaining, especially coming from you. - Yeah, it was very therapeutic. - You know, you're probably not the only person who's felt stressed out during the holidays. - I'm not stressed. I'm just sad. - Are you goin' to the parties this weekend? - I'm going back to bed. - You should try to get this published. I'm goin' to work now. Catch up with you later. - Well viewers, today we have the author of "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho" Katrina Marks. Welcome, Katrina. - Hi. - So I hear that you are a journalist. - Yes, I work for a small paper in Greenbough. - So what made you decide to write this book? - Well last year, I tried to have the perfect Christmas. But when things went terribly wrong, I realized that I was so focused on the stuff of Christmas and not the true meaning of the holiday. - Well yes. I read the book and what I understood is that we should not really feel obligated to write down a checklist durin' the holiday. - Right. Exactly. - So does that mean that this year you will not be doin' any of the usual traditional Christmas things? - No. I mean yes. Yes. I refuse to worry about making sure I've got the perfect gifts or the perfect decorations or the perfect outfit or even the perfect date. I'm not gonna run myself ragged anymore tryin' to be involved in every fundraiser or losing sleep to make sure I've got everything done in time for Christmas. So Yes, I won't be doing it this year. - Well hey, that's enough said. Ms. Katrina Marks is not celebrating Christmas this year, so don't expect a gift or a card. But check out her book "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho". - This is so exciting. You're a published author. - What have I done? - The publisher said your sales went through the roof after that interview. Aren't you excited? - I don't know. - The advanced payment plus the money from the book sales can't hurt, right? Katrina, this should open doors for you. People are loving the book. It's a hit. - But what if I wanna decorate? - We can still decorate. But we'll keep the windows covered, the doors shut and not have anyone over. Of course this means you'll have to do all your shopping online. And if you do go out for anything Christmas related, you'll have to wear a disguise. Think of it as a covert mission. - This is a lot to take in. - You can still go wild with decorations in both of our rooms. This is exciting. The book is a bestseller. My sister's a famous publisher. - You don't need any more coffee. - Cocoa, good idea. There's a thinker. - Questions on assignments? - Hey April, did you do somethin' new with your hair? Looks great. - Thanks, but I still don't forgive you for stealin' that tip about the pipeline. - 'Kay. Hey boss. What'd you think of my idea? - Well you really love the David and Goliath stories, don't you? - You know, is there a problem with that? - No, but we're a small outlet. We need to stick with local stories. Speaking of, this book just came out. I want you to do a story on the book and the author. Now she's a local and works on the other side in the paper division. - "Just say no to feeling obligated to decorate for the holidays. It just makes you feel more depressed when you have to clean up the mess after." I'm gonna just say no to reporting on this book. - Okay, I'll give the story to April. - Fine. I'll do it. - Well if I can't celebrate Christmas publicly, there must be a way I can celebrate anonymously. "Profile name:" Santa's Little Helper. "About me." About me. I love Christmas. If I could celebrate Christmas every day, I would. I have an extensive Santa collection. - There you go. - I'm glad you're goin' with us to get our tree tomorrow. - Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world. Hey you know, I know we didn't do much last year for Christmas. But this year we are gonna go all out and make it the best Christmas ever. - Yay! - I'll do this. All right. "Christmas activities for people who want to go all out for Christmas: baked goods, building a gingerbread house, Christmas stuff around town." Wow, this site is a goldmine of information. "Profile name:" Jolly Soul. - I learned from a young age to be nice, not just because I thought I'd get gifts from Santa but because even back then I knew that what you put into the world comes back to you. - I definitely believe what goes around comes around. I'm curious about your extensive Santa collection. - What can I say? I love Santa. I think it's because my favorite grandfather would only visit at Christmas. And when I was seven, he gave me my first Santa. The whole idea of a magical being who'll give you what you want if you're good has always intrigued me. - That's sweet and you would have to be pretty grumpy to not love Santa. - I'm curious. Why did you pick the name Jolly Soul? - I like to laugh and joke around. I'm actually on this forum for my niece. I have no idea what to do for her for Christmas and I wanna make it extra special for her this year. Last Christmas was tough on her. - I'm sorry to hear that. - It's a long story. But basically, I need help. - Well you've come to the right place. Though ice skating is always fun, there's baking and decorating Christmas cookies, making ornaments, getting and decorating a tree, sledding. - Wow. She knows a lot about Christmas. Those are great ideas. Thanks. - Sure. You know where to reach me. - Will do. Have a merry Christmas. - That was fun. - This isn't gonna be fun. "The competitiveness of Christmas." All right. - We compete with others to have the prettiest decorations, the best gingerbread house and even the perfect partner to take to all our Christmas events. - What's my angle on this story? Oh. I got you. Careful, it's a little slippery. - This isn't a good idea. - I can't help myself. - I could've picked out our tree. - We all have to help pick it out. - We better make this quick then. - Okay. - You pick out the tree. - Okay. - She's excited. - Oh, who gave you that idea? - This is it. - Great. I'll go find my salesperson. Excuse me. - Ow. - Uncle Hunter, I found our tree. - Right. - Who did that? - Lemme see it. - We want this tree. - Wow, you picked a good one. Okay, take this up to the front and I'll have it ready for you in about 20 minutes. - Thank you so much. - Great. Now let's get outta here before anyone recognizes you. - No one is gonna recognize me. - You don't know that. They will know you. I read your book. - Where do I know her from? She's a fraud. - What are you talking about? - I just saw this writer down at the Christmas tree lot. But in her book, she says no to decorating for Christmas. - Okay, but she just got hired to do a column in our newspaper division. - I don't like when people pretend to be somethin' they're not. I wanna expose her. - This could be a great story. - I'm all over it. - Hey, can I help you? - Yeah. Hunter Williams, Channel 20. I'm here to interview Chief Cody about the new station. - He's actually in another interview with that nice lady from the Greenbough Times. - What? - How many trucks do you have at this station? - Eight, I think. - Eight. - Hi. Hi. Hunter Williams, Channel 20. We had that interview scheduled at 1:00. - Oh yeah, I was just talkin' to Katrina here from the Times. - Yeah, we were just wrapping up. It's been a pleasure talking to you, Chief. Thank you so much for your time. I got everything I need. - You're welcome. - Hudson Fire and Rescue. Emergency. - Oh, we gotta go. Can we make this up? - Yes. - Cat on a tree. There are high-voltage power lines in the area. - Probably for the best. Your button's undone. I'm just messing with you. - I found a skating rink. - I wish I could go skating. Fun. Fun. - It's a nice little outdoor skating rink in Hudson. - No way. Hudson. - Yeah, that's close to where I live in Greenbough. - I live in Greenbough. - What? Really? Wow. What a small world. - Have you put up your tree yet? - Yeah. Yeah, we went there opening day and got a tree. - Really? I was there too. - She's everywhere. Maybe we saw each other. - Yeah. - Hey, any ideas for my niece's Christmas gifts? - Well I do this thing for my sister that I call the 12 gifts of Christmas. Starting December 12th, I give her gift a day leading up to Christmas. It's become a tradition. They're not expensive gifts. Just little things like lotion, jewelry, makeup. Girls your niece's age would probably love lip gloss, hair ties, definitely a pair of fuzzy socks. - Ooh, fuzzy socks. Good to know. Maybe I'll get my sister a pair too. Well I better call it. Busy day tomorrow. - Me too. Me too. Take care. Do I have to do the book signing? - It's good for sales. And the more books sold, the more likely you'll get another book deal. - I guess you're right. It's the station. - Answer it. - Hello? Yes, this is Katrina Marks. A story for Channel 20. A reporter will be at the book signing? Uh-huh. Okay. Sure. Bye. Ooh. I just hope they send April. - You got this. - Do I look okay? - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Mark. What are you doing here? And now that you're not so busy with Christmas, maybe we could go to dinner. - Oh. I don't know, Mark. I should be getting back to the book signing. You know, picks up around lunch. Well you see, it gets busier around lunch. - I have a book that needs signing. - Yes. Please. - I'll call you. - Who was that guy? - No one important. So he sent you instead of April. - Yup. Hunter Williams. It's nice to meet you again. I was thinking after the book signing, we could start part one of your interview. - Part one? - Yeah, I wanna do a two-part story on you and your book. - Is that really necessary? - Of course. You have such a unique viewpoint. I wanna know all about it so I can portray you in the proper light. We can meet at the skating rink. There's bleachers out front. - Well- - Well unless it's easier to meet at your house. - No. Skating rink is fine. - Okay. In two hours? - See ya then. - Thank you. - Where is he? - Hey. That's Joe, my cameraman. We'll do a quick interview on camera. And then later, we'll schedule set up our one-on-one time. - Okay. - Don't be nervous. Just be your honest self, 'kay? All right. Hunter Williams here with local superstar Katrina Marks who is the author of "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho", offerin' a unique perspective on Christmas. So what was your inspiration for the story? - Well I used to go all out for Christmas. Some might say I was obsessive about it. But last year, that all came crashing down. My boyfriend dumped me, I lost my job and I broke something very sentimental to me. - Sounds like an unfortunate Christmas or country music or a country music song. - It was then when I realized that I was putting way too much pressure on myself and I thought maybe, maybe there were others out there that did the same. And this book is about freeing yourself from the guilt and the pressure of the holidays. - In your book, you said that you are done decorating for Christmas, that people shouldn't feel obligated to decorate. - Well for one, decorating can be expensive and it's a lot of work. No one wants to take all of those decorations down at the end of the season. And then there's the issue of storage. I mean where do you store all this stuff you use once a year? - Decorating can remind us of the beauty of Christmas. It could be a fun bonding moment. - Yes, but the holidays aren't always a happy time for some people and they don't wanna be pressured into decorating. This book gives them permission to just say no without feeling like a Scrooge. - So I take it you didn't put up your Christmas tree this year. - The point of my book is that it's okay to say no to Christmas, the activities and obligations. Could be quite freeing. - Well you heard it here, folks, straight from the author's mouth. Free yourself from the responsibilities of Christmas. We got it. That's it. I'd like to set up our next appointment. Excuse me. Hey. Okay, yup. I have to go. I'll be in touch about our next meeting, 'kay? All right. - Ready to skate? Hey. How's it goin'? - Uncle Hunter. - Hey, got the skate. - How'd it go? - Terrible. Another reporter. I mean I don't know him well, but he works with April and I bumped into him last year. There was sort of a spark. But I don't think he remembers me though. He's a bit of a jerk. - How so? - I feel like he's onto me, you know? Like he's waitin' for me to slip up or something. - You're just being paranoid. - Maybe. Oh. And you're never gonna guess who came to the book signing. Mark. - He did? Why? - Wants to go to dinner. - You're not going out with him, are you? - Absolutely not. Although if I can't go to any Christmas parties or go shopping. I'm just joking. Don't worry. - Yeah, I'm great at that. This 12 gifts of Christmas idea is great. My niece loves it. - Oh good. I'm actually wrapping presents right now. - Oh. Me too. - You said last year was tough on her. - My sister's husband just up and left last year before Christmas. - Wow. That's terrible. I'm so sorry. - I knew my sister really needed me and she didn't wanna uproot my niece, so I moved to be here with them. That's terrible. That was nice of you to uproot your life for family. - Aww. It's part of my sibling duties. Family means everything to me. - I feel exactly the same. I don't know what I'd do without my sister. She's my best friend. - And I wanna prove to them that not all men are jerks. - Now you have your sister and niece close by and possibly a significant other to share the holidays with. - No girlfriend or significant other. I did have a girlfriend before I moved here, but she wanted no part of Greenbough. - Oh. That's awful she didn't wanna come with you. - She's a city girl. Well what about you? Do you have a boyfriend, husband? - N-O. No. I'm a little too busy for a relationship right now, but I think your girlfriend was crazy to let you go. - Thanks. And it sounds like you just haven't met a guy worthy of you yet. - That's sweet of you to say. - Well it was great connecting with you again. - Goodnight, Jolly Soul. - Sweet dreams, Santa's Little Helper. Hey. - Hey. Thanks for giving Charlotte a ride. I had to do some Christmas shopping and I lost track of time. I guess I was tryin' to do too much. - Hmm. Maybe this lady's book can have some merit after all. - Book? - Oh, I'm doin' a story on a local author who wrote a book called "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho". - Funny title. - Yeah, well even funnier is she doesn't practice what she preaches. - What do you mean? - Well I caught her at the Christmas tree lot when we went to get our tree. - So? - So in her book, she says she doesn't wanna decorate anymore. - Maybe the tree was for someone else. - We'll see. I have an interview with her again. Hopefully I'll catch her slippin' up. - So that's what your story is about. You're hoping to catch her in a lie. - It's investigative reporting. Hey, I am just tryin' to see if she is who she says she is. - Right. You sure? - Mm-hmm. - Really? - Obviously. - That's pretty shaky. - You'll see. - Maybe that was him. - Who? - This guy I met online. - You're not online dating, are you? - No, no. I just met this guy on this Christmas website. He goes by the name Jolly Soul and we're really connecting. - We shouldn't even be here. - Oh, I had to get some of Mrs. Goodwin's famous biscotti for mom and dad. - Well biscotti'll get us busted is what I say. - Katrina? Katrina? - Take a look. Hunter. Hey. - Almost didn't recognize you. - Oh, well I didn't wanna be recognized by fans. - What're you doin'? - My sister wanted to pick up some cookies and I needed my caffeine fix. Right? - Right. Hi, I'm Lindsey. - Oh, I'm sorry. - You're the one doing this story about Katrina's book. - I am. Actually, I'm glad I ran into you. I was hoping we could set up our next interview at the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Right. I keep hopin' you'll wanna do somethin' Christmasy. - No. How about we meet at the bakery? - Yeah, let's say Monday at 10:00. - Sure, it's a date. I mean I'll put that date on my calendar. - Right. It was nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. - Have a nice day. - That's the reporter? - Yeah and that was a close one. He almost caught me. - You didn't tell me he was cute. - And annoying. - And cute. - I think he has a girlfriend. He might even be married with a kid. - I didn't see a ring on his finger. Look, I don't care if I'm a one-woman dating service. I'll take care of you. - Hey April. - Hey. How's the new position? - Great so far. Thanks for putting in a good word for me. - Well you did them a favor by taking the position. I mean they needed some fresh eyes in that department. - It's really nice to have a job where you can make your own hours. Can't beat that. - Unless you write a bestseller. I'm so excited for you. It's about time you used that journalism degree. - Thanks. I was just sad when you didn't do the interview. - Yeah, plus they gave that assignment to Hunter. I don't know why. - I would've loved to do it. - And I would've loved you to do it. - Well he'll do a good job. Hunter's like an orange. - I'm sorry, did you say an orange? - Yeah, you have to peel back his tough exterior to get to his sweet side. - Yeah. - Oh, but don't tell him I said that because he is the competition. - Oh. Hmm. My lips are sealed. Well I better get back to work. I'm off to the toy drive today. - Oh, it's this week, isn't it? - Yeah. - Okay, well we should hang out sometime. But after the holidays, since I know you're not going to any parties this year. - That's right, yes. I mean no, I am not going out to any Christmas parties this year. I'm definitely not doing Christmas. Thanks. Bye. Oh my gosh. You almost gave me a heart attack. - Yeah, I was on email and you came around the- - Yeah, well I didn't know you were gonna. - No. Yeah. You should really watch where you're goin'. - What? - Hey boss, what'd you need? - I need you to cover the toy drive. It's happening at the fire station. - That sounds more like April's thing. - No, I just sent her to cover the hospital's charity fashion show. You can switch with her if you'd like. - No, no. Toy drive it is. - Oh, Hunter. How's that Santa book story going? - It's going. - Well and how many gifts do you get each year? - One for every child, of course. - Oh, that's amazing. I think I've got everything I need. So can we get some photos? - Sure. - Great. That's perfect. - Ho, ho, ho. - You know, - I'll be right back. Hmm, I'd almost say you're following me. - I'm just always chasin' a good story. - Ho, ho, ho. - Okay. I better let you get to it then. - You know, I am surprised you're coverin' a story about givin' away Christmas gifts to kids. Isn't that one way to celebrate Christmas? - Well I guess you could look at it that way. But when it comes to making sure no child goes without knowing they're loved or important enough to Santa to bring them a gift, then I don't feel like that's a mindless thing we do during the holidays. Now I'm no longer the head of fundraising and I'm just here doin' my job. So if it helps some kids feel special, then I'm sorry? - Oh. No. No. No, you're right. It's a good cause and you're just doin' your job. - 'Kay, so go in there and help promote it. - I'm on it. - Look at this. He's decorating his Christmas tree. - Who's that? Jolly Nick, your online boyfriend? - He's not my boyfriend. Just if I can't do Christmas, at least I can help someone else do Christmas. - Good point. I'm surprised there were guys on the forum. - He's on it for his niece, to get ideas for Christmas gifts and activities. It's been really nice talkin' to someone who loves Christmas as much as I do. - Ahem. - Oh, as much as we do. - Thank you. - Beautiful. - This red one? - Yeah. - Is everything okay? - Oh, I'm just chattin' with someone online. - Someone online? - It's a long story. - Just a friend? - Or is it a girlfriend? - Charlotte. - Charlotte, go to your room. - You're blushing. - I'm not blushing. - And he's blushing. - He's goin' red. - No, I'm not. So what other Christmas activities do you suggest? - Well making gingerbread houses is always fun. They have kits to make it easy and your niece would probably love that. - Wow, I haven't made a gingerbread house since I was a kid. - You should definitely do it then. You can also make Christmas cookies, decorate stockings or make ornaments. Just go to the craft store There's something I wanna tell you. - You think my niece will like these? - She'll love them. - Charlotte and my sister I got them Santa ornaments for the next gift. Your love of Santa is rubbing off on me. - I'm pleased to hear it. - You need to show me - Sure, but it's missing the first Santa that my grandfather ever gave me. I accidentally broke it last year. - I'm so sorry to hear that. - Thank you. It makes me sad 'cause it was very special to me. Okay, so I'll share a pic. - So this is what you look like. I'm a little older now. - Well that's good. Maybe I can see what you look like now. Since we both live in Greenbough, maybe we should meet. - I can't. I think I have the flu. I'll be fine. I just can't go out for awhile. - Maybe some other time? - Sure. He wants to meet. He said he wants to meet. - Jolly Soul? - Mm-hmm. - What did you say? - I told him I was sick and that I can't. - But you wanna meet him, don't you? - Yes. No. I don't know. - I can tell that you like him. Unless you have feelings for that reporter guy. - Don't be silly. - You said there was an initial attraction. And why do you care what you look like if there's nothin' goin' on? - Just tryin' to figure out what to wear. - Then why did you do your hair? - Maybe he wants a photo. - Maybe. That one. - This one? - That one. Not the tights, but that one. - Of course not the tights. - You totally like her. I knew it. - No. No, but why would you say that? - Since when do you care what you look like unless you like a girl? - Because it is a business meeting and I wanna look professional. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Okay. All right. - Thank you. - Here, let me. I'm just Santa's Little Helper. Ring a bell? Anything? Why am I so nervous? It's not like it's a date. It's not a date. It's not a date. Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. After you. - No. After you. - Ladies first. - Okay. Hi. Can I get a black coffee please? Thank you. - That must be yours because you hate Christmas. - Stop it. It's not that I don't like Christmas. Make sure you make that clear in your story. You know, I'm not Scrooge. I just don't think people should feel pressured to do certain things during Christmas. - Well don't you miss things like Christmas shopping? - You mean running around exhausted tryin' to fight the crowds? - Seein' that special someone open your gift with delight. - Seeing them pretend to like it while secretly planning how to return or re-gift it. - And no romance this Christmas? - I didn't say you can't fall in love. I just don't think you should date someone just because of the pressure to be with someone on the holidays. - And are you seein' someone? - Maybe. But if I was, it wouldn't be with someone like you. - Oh. Okay. Jeez. That hurts. What's wrong with me? I'm a nice guy. - I'm sorry. I'm sure you're a nice guy when you're not getting a story. - Well you know, I'm just challenging you. It helps you grow. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one being challenged. You missed a spot. Yeah. - Yeah? - Right under the nose. Okay, you got it. You're good. You're good. - I got it all? - Yup. - I guess I see your point. - Yeah. - Well I really do hope you find love. That guy was an idiot to let you go. I mean even though you were clearly a misled about Christmas, you have some good attributes. Yeah. Oh, look. Christmas trolley. Too bad you don't like Christmas. This looks fun. - Well maybe you should take your girlfriend. - Oh, I don't- - Wait. Wait, are you the author "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho"? - Yeah. - Your book was such a relief. I usually go all out for Christmas. But after reading your book, I learned that it's okay to turn it down a notch. - I'm so glad it helped. Thank you. - No, thank you. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - See? Put that in your story. My book helps people. - All right. Okay. In your book, you mention that you were obsessed with Christmas before this year, but you never said why. - Yeah, well I don't like to talk about my past or personal life, you know? Especially with you. - Okay. - Wait. Okay, that came out wrong. It's just you know, you're doing the story. - It's okay. - Fine. - No. - So when I was little- - It's okay. It's okay. I think I have enough for the story. - You do? - Yeah. Yeah. - So that's it? - That's it. - Huh. - Take care. Right, I will finish with that. Oh and I emailed you a copy of my story about Katrina Marks. It's just a glorified book review, but it'll be good for her publicity-wise. - I'm sorry you didn't get the expose you thought you would. - I need to just stop being so skeptical. - I love 'em. Thanks. Hello? Did you hear me? - Hmm? What? - Is something wrong? You seem distracted. - No. It's just Hunter. - What about Hunter? - I actually think I'm gonna miss meeting up with him. It's just something he said that's been playing on my mind. - What did he say? - He said Mark was stupid to let me go. - He said that? That means he has feelings for you. - He has a girlfriend. - How can you be sure? - I saw him at the skating rink with this beautiful woman and a young girl. I'm sure it was her that was calling him during the interview. - It could've been a sister, a friend. If you have feelings for Hunter, what does that mean for Jolly Soul? - I don't know. Jolly Soul is sweet and kind. He's family-oriented and thoughtful. It's so easy just open up to him. - What if you meet him in real life and there's no chemistry like the chemistry you have with Hunter? - If I could just put the two together, I'd have the perfect guy. - Maybe it's time to meet Jolly Soul. - Do you think chemistry is important in a relationship? - I think chemistry is important, but it can't be the only thing two people share. It won't sustain a relationship. - We have a great connection online. But what if we meet and we don't feel it in person? - I suppose that's a risk we'd have to be willing to take. I also think chemistry could grow once you get to know a person. Either way, I think we've become great friends. - I'd be open to meeting if you're still interested. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Yes, how about the waterfront park tomorrow at 2:00? - Okay. Okay. - How will I know it's you? - I'll be wearing a red winter coat and Christmas earrings. - Okay, see you tomorrow. - You're not supposed to eat it. - Why not? - So are you done with your story about the author? You like her, don't you? - I can't worry about that now. I'm gonna meet my online friend. - You are? - Oh, okay. Look at you two. I wanna get her somethin'. She was sorta my Christmas coach tellin' me what to get for everybody else, so I don't know what to get her. - What does she like? - That's it. You are a genius. I'm gonna get goin'. I got some shoppin' to do. - Okay, have fun. - Yeah. - Are you crazy? - I can't help it. Think I'm falling in love. - What did you just say? - I'm just tired of shopping online. I need to buy something special for Jolly Soul, for his niece, his sister. Maybe even Hunter for doin' the story. - Katrina! - I gotta go. Call you later. - I reviewed your story. But you were right, it's a glorified book review. I've decided to run April's story. - No, actually there's something you need to see. It might change your mind about the story. - What is it? - Video proof that Katrina Marks is a fraud. - I'll look it over. I'll look it over. - Why am I so nervous? - Can't believe you're actually meeting him. - I know. - Hope there's chemistry like you have with that- - Oh, chemistry isn't everything. You know, I feel like we bonded. I've shared things with him I haven't shared with anyone. I've decided to tell him the truth. - What? - I'm gonna tell him why I signed up for the forum, about my book, everything. I know. Wish me luck. - I've decided to air your story tonight on the six o'clock news. - Wait, but my story was supposed to air tonight. - Congratulations, man. - Thanks. I gotta get goin'. - Where are you goin'? - I gotta go home and get ready to meet this girl I met online. - I didn't know you started online dating. - I'm not. It's just someone I met on a Christmas forum. - Christmas forum? - Where is he? - Katrina? Katrina is Santa's Little Helper. - Hey, how'd it go? - Oh. You wanna talk about it? - It's her. - Who? - The girl that I met online - That makes no sense. - Actually that makes perfect sense. She loves Christmas so much that she logged on to the forum anonymously because she had to hide her love for Christmas. - What are you gonna do? - I don't know. I better stop that story. - Yeah, yeah. Go, go. - I guess he just took one look at me and bolted. - Don't be silly. That's absurd. There was probably some sort of emergency. - Well he didn't send any messages. - I'm sure you're goin' to find out later that something urgent came up. - Never been so humiliated. - Hey, I need you to stop the story. - I can't. It's already locked in and set to air. - There was something I wanted to tell you. So that's why I had to go on the forum and be anonymous. I wanted you to know the truth. I don't know why you didn't show, but I just hope everything is okay. - Yeah, but now she's gonna hate me. - I'm sorry you couldn't stop the story. - Yeah, I ruined it. - Well maybe reach out to her, explain your side. - No, I can't. - Why not? - There's just no use. It's over. - Have you heard anything from him yet? - Nope. - Maybe this thing with Jolly Soul wasn't supposed to work out. Look, your story. - In the book "Just say No to Ho Ho Ho", author Katrina Marks writes about just sayin' no to Christmas shoppin' and gift buyin'. And yet, this happened. - Did you see that? I can't believe it. I knew he was up to no good. I should've listened to myself. I started to think he was different and I was wrong. What an idiot! - Maybe you could come clean, explain your side or tell everyone that I convinced you to keep up the ruse. - No. It's over. It's over. - I'm sorry Leslie pulled your story and ran mine instead. Go ahead, open it. - Wow. Thank you. - I hope we can put our competitiveness aside. Let's just work together. - Yeah. - Hey April. I wanna ask a favor. Can I come in to do another interview please? Thanks. - Hi, I'm here with Katrina Marks, author of "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho" to set the record straight. - When I wrote "Just Say No to Ho Ho Ho", I wrote a rant. 'Cause my Christmas did not go as planned and I was so stressed because I always do too much. Well my sister found it and she sent it to a publisher who wanted to release it as a book. I felt like I had to hide my love of Christmas in order to sell the book, so I tried to be someone I wasn't. I discovered that I miss decorating and buying gifts and doing Christmasy things. And I admit you know, I did decorate a little. I got a tree, baked a little. Even shop for friends and family, but I did not overbook myself and no one expected anything from me this year. Thought it was really nice to slow down and not worry about making sure everything is perfect. My holidays have become more of a to-do list rather than spending time with loved ones, doing fun traditions together of the season. It's been my best Christmas yet, except for the story last night. I realized that Christmas is not about making sure everything is perfect which is still the point of my book. It's about sharing the joy, the kindness, the magic of the holidays. - That's so true. Well there you have it, folks, straight from the author's mouth. Merry Christmas, everyone. That's a wrap. - Thank you for letting me tell my side of the story. I'm so glad it was you and not Hunter who did the interview. - Katrina, you don't know, do you? - Know what? - Hunter tried to stop the story. - He did? - He said something about a girl he met online at a Christmas forum and he tried to stop the story, but it was too late. - I had no idea. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, everyone. - I'm glad she got to set the record straight. - Are you still not gonna tell her that you're Jolly Soul? - Hey, you wanna watch a movie? - No thanks. - Hello? I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to say no. I just can't commit at the moment, but thank you so much. - Who was that? - The hospital. They wanted me for fundraising next year. - I can't believe you just said no. - Well I'm still gonna volunteer for the toy drive, but I'm not gonna go crazy and overbook myself anymore. I want plenty of time for me and family next Christmas. No, I'm not available. - That's right. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you were someone else. You want me to write a book on the joys of Christmas. Mm-hmm. Okay, sure. I'll look out for that email. Sure. - Your next book. That's so exciting and one that truly represents who you are. - Uh-huh, yeah. Guess that's true. - You don't seem to be too excited. Isn't this what you always wanted? - I always thought so, but now I'm not so sure. I've missed our talks. I believe we have something special and I'd love to meet you. I'll be at the park tonight Christmas Eve, seven o'clock. I'll be wearing a red jacket and Christmas earrings. I hope to see you there. - Thank you, Uncle Hunter. - Thanks. I love fuzzy socks. - Yeah. - They're cute. - You're welcome. - Hey, what's going on? - She wants to meet. - When? - In 15 minutes. - What? What are you still doin' sitting here? - She's gonna hate me when she finds out I'm Jolly Soul. - No, not if you tell her the truth. - She won't hate you, Uncle Hunter. No one can hate you. - Mm-hmm. - That's very sweet. Thank you. - Plus I like her. She makes you happy. - I agree. - Well. - Go. - Go, go, go. - Go. - Okay. Before you say anything, I know you weren't expectin' it to be me. - I actually knew it was you. - You did. And you still wanted to meet? - I was pleased it was you. - You were. Oh. - Kind of annoying, but I like how you challenged me. - I like how I got to know the part of you that loves Christmas and I'm sorry how my story turned out. - I guess you were just doing your job. - So now what? - I tried not to look for love on Christmas. - Yeah. - But sometimes love finds you when you least expect it. - So does that mean you like me? - Maybe. Oh no, I didn't know we were exchanging gifts now. - We're not. Well I found this at a vintage store. - I don't know what to say. - I know it's not the one your grandfather got you. - It's the perfect gift. Thank you so much.
