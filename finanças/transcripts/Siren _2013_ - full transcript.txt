(silence) - [Voiceover] You're here. Listen. Pay attention. Once upon a time, there was a special, valuable, dangerous girl. A golden goose with bite. You're gonna love her. Everyone does. She's hiding, alone. And we need to find her.

(blood rushes) (heart beats) I say, you are the, the loveliest woman I've ever seen. Actually, I don't use these. Just for driving, you know. - [Leigh] That's great. - So, where's the girl, that bewitched my son? - I live here alone. - Are you her sister? - [Leigh] No, I live here alone. - I just had the craziest idea. - [Leigh] No, you didn't. - [Carl] I just had - [Carl] the sudden urge, I can't believe I'm gonna say this to you. You and I, should run away together. - [Leigh] I'm sorry, I.. - [Carl] No... - [Carl] I love you. - [Leigh] No, thank you... - [Carl] Now look at me. - [Carl] You should be so flattered. (hand slaps) (Leigh gasps) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... I wish you didn't make me do that. (muffled protests) (electricity zaps) - [Carl] No... - [Officer] Let's go, buddy, come on. Come on. - [Carl] No! I love her. I love you! - Get in. (sighs) So are we gonna get a statement from the owner? - What do you think? (engine starts) (engine revs) (gate squeaks) (Leigh grunts) - Sorry, your gate was open. I didn't realize anybody lived here. - A little help? - Oh, uh... Yeah, sure. (grunts) Do you mind? - Uh, no. - Wow, ah... Screwdriver, please? Can I get a screwdriver, please? - How are you... How are you not? (electricity whines) (Leigh gasps) (alarm beeps) It works. - It runs. For it to work, I'd need uh... I'd need some more tools and a uh... I'd need a uh... (breathes heavily) - Are you okay? - Yeah, I uh... I just, I get... Where am I? - My guest house. - What happened? - You fainted. - Yeah, that happens. (spoon clanks) - [Leigh] Hypo... - [Guy] Glycemic, yeah. - [Leigh] How do you see me? - That a trick question? - How do you see me? - With my eyes. - No, I mean... How do I appear to you? - I don't know, uh... Pleasant? Nice? - Nice? - Not, not nice as in boring, you know, I... - No, nice is good. Nice is great. - Okay, well... I feel better, so... - You seem to be pretty good with those wires. Are you some kind of, are you some kind of handyman? - Some kind. - You um, new in town? - I'm just passing through. I'm Guy. - I'm, I'm Leigh. - Pleased to meet you, Leigh. Thanks for your hospitality. - Um... I need someone. To fix my alarm. And the monitors, they've shorted. - Look, uh... Thanks for the sugar, all right? I really gotta go. - Do you have somewhere you have to be? I could pay you. 100 a day. 200. Cash. - A few days' work sounds good. (Leigh sighs) - Well... (door locks) (light orchestral music) (static hisses intermittently) (footsteps approach) (latch clicks) - Morning. - Uh, for the... For the fainting. - Thanks. - [Voiceover] Hundreds of area homes are still without power after a sub station sh... (easy listening music) (light string music) (heart beats) (bird strikes window) (birds tweet) (solemn string music) (doorbell rings) - Patrick Colton, City Press. Carl Tobin? - Yeah. How can I help you? - I understand you were arrested the other day. - Yeah. Uh, just a misunderstanding. A few too many drinks after work. - Why isn't the owner of the house pressing charges? - The owner, I didn't meet anybody. - Hm. So how you feeling, Mister Tobin? - I feel fine, I slept it off. - Any residual feelings? - Just, you know, a little embarrassed. - Give us a call if there's any changes. - [Carl] Will do. - No apparent residual effects. (birds tweet) - [Guy] Leigh. - Have you ever smelt anything so fresh? (sniffs) - No, never. Why me? You know, why open your house to a uh... - Drifter? - Well, I was gonna say traveler, but... - Well, I need someone to help, and you proved yourself handy, so, why look for anyone else? And I have a feeling about you. - But why not just get a uh, electrician from town? Hard to find the help? - It's hard to get them to leave. Oh, do you smell that? What is that smell? When's the last time you washed your clothes? - About two weeks ago, why? - How can you... - [Guy] What? - [Leigh] Oh... - [Guy] What? - [Guy] What? - [Leigh] Go wash them. - [Leigh] Before you kill us both. - [Guy] Now? - Yes. (both laugh) - All right. - Please. - [Father] Hm, in the middle they're still... - [Mother] Oh, you're good! - [Father] Here's your cake, darling. - [Mother] 15! - [Father] Oh, wow, 15, I can't believe it. - [Mother] Wow. - [Father] It's only a few more days, right? - [Mother] Yeah, you'll be home, I got you lots of presents. - [Father] Happy birthday. - [Mother] Yay! (string music with female vocalization) - [Father] I'm sorry, honey. - [Leigh] I'm sorry, Dad. (telephone rings) Hello? - [Voiceover] Hello, Leigh, this is Patrick Colton from Circe. (tense, high-pitched whine) Just calling to thank you for seven years of loyal service. - How did you find me? - [Voiceover] Does that matter? - This wasn't the arrangement. - [Voiceover] The climate out there has changed. Once a month isn't enough, anymore. - You know that's all I can produce. - [Voiceover] Do we? Know that for sure? We'd like you to come down to the lab, run some tests, try some new methods. - Yes, I got your letters. - [Voiceover] Then you know it's essential you come in. - I can't do that. - [Voiceover] Then maybe we should come to you. - You wouldn't. You know what will happen if you... - [Voiceover] No threats, please. You're our most valuable resource. (static hisses) (Leigh breathes heavily) (Leigh sobs) - When will the alarm be fixed? - I'm working as fast as I can. - Be careful. This survived Stalin and the Nazis, but it's still fragile. - My rough hands can handle delicate things. - You're wearing a towel. - [Guy] As requested. My clothes are being washed. (birds tweet) (orchestral music) (static hisses) Leigh? (Guy knocks on wood) Leigh? (low string music) (static hisses intermittently) - Finally put our son to bed. I hope he sleeps tonight. Carl. Carl, are you okay? Carl, I asked you a question. (Agnes exclaims) (glass shatters) (crickets chirp) (door locks) (Agnes sighs) - It's, it's my... - [Carl] No, don't say it. It happens to everybody, it's normal. - I wasn't gonna say that. I'm angry. - Damn it, Agnes, I said I'm sorry. I couldn't do it. - It's me, right? - No. - No longer the prettiest girl in town. What? - There's someone else. (birds tweet) - We wanted to give you something, Peanut, to remind you of us while we're on vacation. - It's only three days, honey. - I still don't think it's a good idea to leave at all. - We discussed this, honey. She's 18, now. - [Mother] I know, but... - [Father] And insisted. - [Father] We need to set up the dead letter drops, so they can't find her. We'll be back before you know it. - [Mother] We love you. - [Father] We love you. - [Father] So much, honey. - Mwah. - They found me, Daddy. But I met someone. Eugh. Here you go, steak tartare. - Great. - Stop! - Wh... Why? - You can't smell. You can't smell. - No. I uh, I have a condition. Anosmia, you ever hear of it? - [Leigh] Yeah. - [Guy] Really? - [Leigh] Yeah. - It's not that bad, unless there's a gas leak. - [Leigh] You really can't smell at all? - The worst part is that everything tastes the same. A fancy restaurant smells the same as hospital food. - I grew up on hospital food. - [Guy] Yeah, well, I've had my share. - Well how'd you get it? Is that why you're running? - What makes you think I'm running? - People don't drift anymore. They have places to go. And fewer still stay at strangers' houses. You're running from something. Or towards it, I'm not sure which. - [Guy] I've got work to do. (violin music) (static hisses) (gate squeaks) (heart beats) - I did it. I left Agnes, we can be together now. - I'm calling the police. - No, no you don't say that when I say something like that to you. When I say something nice to you, you say, "thank you." You say, "I love you." Say it. Say it, say it. (Leigh grunts) (Carl grunts) (hand slaps) - Get out! Get out! (electricity whines) - [Carl] Ah! Fuck! (electricity zaps) Ah! (engine starts) (engine revs) - [Guy] Hey, you all right? Who was that guy? - No one, he's just... - [Guy] Husband? - No, I'm not married. - Boyfriend. - [Leigh] No. - He was hurting you. - I took care of it. - [Guy] Yeah, I saw that, that bastard. - It's not his fault! - What do you mean, Leigh? What's going on? - I also have a condition. Come with me. It's okay, you're safe. - Excuse me, sorry to bother you. I'm actually looking for a young girl. About 13? - Not again. - She's had quite an effect on my son. - This is from the day you arrived. - I love you. - I give off a pheromone. A smell that makes men see me as their heart's desire. Their fantasy. And fall in love with me instantly. Not real love, just a smell. - Come on, this is crazy. What does one guy... (Leigh sighs) (keyboard clicks) How does this happen? - I don't know. No one does. - [Guy] And you've always been this way? - Ever since puberty. There was an incident at school when I was 12. I haven't been the same since. - Why do you keep that there? - To remind me of why I can't ever leave. - You have a power. This is a gift. - No, not the word I would use. Once a month, I dilute and ship a bit of myself. My essence, to Circe Laboratories. You heard of them? - Yeah. - They drop a microscopic amount into every one of their best-selling perfume bottles. Making anyone who wears it, slightly more attractive. The perfume actually works. And it pays the bills. But until the alarm and all of the monitors are fixed, I am not safe. (static hisses) (quiet string music) - [Guy] Ah, God. (coughs) Be careful. - [Leigh] Yes. - [Guy] All right. (electricity whines) (monitors beep) (Leigh laughs) So your power has no effect on me. - Oh! (Guy groans) Oh, I'm so sorry! Were you flirting? (laughs) - Do you even know what flirting is? - [Leigh] Yes. - [Guy] Uh huh. - [Leigh] No. Sometimes. I haven't had a normal conversation with anyone since my parents died. And I've never flirted. At all. (Leigh gasps) (door squeaks) (girl sings tinnily on cassette tape) (cello screeches) What did you think? - It was... Awful. It was, it was not good at all. And really bad. (both laugh) - Oh my, oh, wow, no one's, No one's really ever been that honest. (female singing over string music) (projector rattles) (bottles clink) - You shoulda told me. That you had a 74 Chateau Latour. - It was a gift. - It's happy hour. - Do you appreciate it? 80% of our taste is in our nose. - Yeah, but the other 20 is amazing. (glass clinks) - Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. I, I'm... I'm really drunk. I've never been this drunk before. - That's fine. - I've never been so many things. Thank you. Were you in the military? - Engineer Corp. Mechanic. - To the military. Good old Uncle Sam. (Leigh laughs) Who gave you that? Special lady friend? - My mother. She died. When I was over there. - To being orphans. (Guy laughs) It's very pretty. - So's your necklace. - So, why are you on the run? And, why do you have, um... Ano... A nose? - [Guy] Anosmia. - [Leigh] Anosmia. - [Guy] Anosmia. - [Leigh] Anosmia. (Guy laughs) Anosmia. How did you get it? - Oh, that one. Well that's easy. They're the same story. - What, what's the same story? What? - Mortar attack. I watched a, a whole bunch of civilians get torn to shreds along with my um... My olfactory nerves. I was home for one week, trying to readjust when uh, I got called up again. Couldn't face it, so... I ran. - You went AWOL? - If they find me. They arrest me. So I run. And I hide. You know all about that, right Leigh? Leigh? Leigh? (quiet orchestral music) (door squeaks) (gun clicks) (knocks on wood) (money rustles) - Refreshments. - [Guy] Hey. - Is this what a hangover feels like? It sucks. - It's not that bad. All right. (electricity whines and hums) Your alarm is fixed. - You're done? - [Guy] I'm done. I'll be out of your hair by this afternoon. - Well I have many more things that need fixing. In the house, I um... - Storm drains need patching. - Yeah, right. - Hey, where else do I have to be? I need to pop into town, pick up some supplies. I'll be back before dark. Why don't you come with me? You need to see what's out there. - I have everything I need here. - I need to go. I'll be back. - [Leigh] Guy? - [Guy] Hm? - [Leigh] Can I trust you? - Yeah. I'll be back. - [Leigh] You should shower first. (quiet string music) (heart beats) (tense music) (dog whines) (dog barks) - Excuse me, Miss, I'm sorry. I ordered an Irish coffee. - [Waitress] All we have is Columbian. - Can I just get a shot of whiskey? I'll just pour it in, myself. - [Waitress] Why didn't you just order that from the start? - Charming as always, I see. What's the hold up? (Guy sighs) - [Guy] What do they want to do with her? - It's not your business. - Maybe it's not her, I mean, If you had a photo, I could... - She hasn't been photographed as an adult. Does she wear the necklace? - Yeah. - Then that's her. - You know what, she's just a lonely girl. (Guy grunts) - You get that necklace off of her. So we can go in. And then Circe cleans your record. - It's not that easy, she never takes the damn thing off. - You got two days. After that, you go to jail. You take her down, or we take her out. It's up to you. (gun clatters on floor) - You're him, aren't you? - Do I know you? - You're staying with her. - There you are! Take these to the car. - [Boy] Mom... - I'll be there in a minute, go. Oh, nice bracelet. Magnolia's the most fragrant flower. I hope he wasn't bothering you. - No, no, I uh, think he had me confused with someone else. - You may have seen his father arrested a few days ago? Up at her place. Carl. Whatever she did to him, the man is broken. He's no good to me, anymore. He's certainly no good to the boy. He's got his own mess. I heard him quoting Shakespeare the other day. What the hell? Hope she didn't make him gay. - Hardly. - Sorry to bother with this, this is not your problem, you can't help it. - Help what? - What the witch does when she gets her claws into you. I feel sorry for you. - Jesus Christ. - She is a snake. A black cat. A siren. Everybody falls under her spell. - Who are they? - You are not safe. You can't ruin peoples' lives and not expect feedback. You should move on, while you can. - Hey, Mom, do you have a dollar for... (hand slaps) - I said I'd be right there! I hope my words helped. - Yeah. - You take care, now. (heart beats) - [Guy] Nice day we're having, fellas. (Man cries out) (tense music) (fists smack) Why'd you attack me? - I don't know. (bell rings) (alarm wails) (alarm silences) - [Leigh] You should've showered before you left. - So you knew this would happen? - I knew something would. They smelt me on you. - Believe me, they were not loving me. - The smell reminded them of me. It was a tease, it made them hate you. - Well then why'd you let me go? - [Leigh] I didn't want you to go. Let me get you some ice. - Hold on. If your smell on me made them aggressive then why'd you bottle it? - Who says I bottle smell? - The townspeople, you know one of them called you a witch. - Aren't I? I'm a freak. - Leigh, you are not a freak. - Don't tell me what I am. It's not just men that I affect. A bird flies through the window at me and breaks its neck. Do you know how many animals I've buried in the forest? I'm a freak! - Leigh... - I live in a house, alone, surrounded by flowers. I have to burn tar to mask my scent. I have to wear death around my neck. - You need to start trusting me. You need to open up to me, you need to tell me everything. What do those buttons do? (Leigh sighs) - If I press the right button, the lab explodes. - If you press the left one? - The button pricks my finger with poison. Killing me. - With a little help from a blue frog. But why? - Only I get to decide how I live and when I die. Circe makes a lot more than perfume. In its undiluted form, my essence can be abused by governments, armies. I can't let that happen. - But what makes you think that's even what they want? - Because it isn't the first time that they've tried. Please, it hurts. No, stop. No more tests! No, stop. No! No more tests, no more tests. I was 15. No... No! Imagine what they'd do to me, now. My essence has grown stronger. (female singing over string music) These were designed by Eva Zeisel. She survived Nazi Germany and red Russia. In 1936 she was accused of plotting against Stalin, and was imprisoned for 16 months. But did she break down? - No? - Did she go crazy? - No. - [Leigh] Did she lose faith? - No. (Leigh laughs) - No. Who am I to mope? I thought you fixed the monitors? How... - They're free. They're online. Just gotta know how to patch into it. (Leigh laughs) Since you can't see the world, thought I'd bring the world to you. - [Voiceover] A government bill to crack down on laboratory experiments on animals is expected to become law, today. Animal rights activists have been pushing for the... - [Voiceover] Is an accident waiting to happen. (knife chops) - [Voiceover] The multimillion dollar drug smuggling ring. 22 pounds of heroin were seized along... - [Voiceover] A master of deception. (knife chops quickly and loudly) - [Voiceover] 25 people have been arrested and face charges when... (knife chops loudly) - Mom? (slow piano notes) (water runs) (branch snaps) (Guy snickers) - Scary. - So people can't see me. Plus, it helps to dampen my pheromones. - [Guy] Uh huh. - And it makes me look fearsome. - Oh, oh yeah, I'm terrified. (Leigh laughs) (string music) So is that why you brought me out here? - You are such a cliche. (phone beeps) - What? - The lookout point. The moment, the view. You're gonna try and kiss me. - You led me here. (water ripples) Oh, that's pretty. - Sh, sh. (water splashes) - [Guy] My God. You're amazing. Ah, man. I thought that was dinner. - [Man] Look. - I saw her first! - Yeah, yeah. - I'm coming, doll. I'm coming to you, darling, coming through! (female singing over tinkling music) - Hello? Guy? Guy? (Leigh gasps) - Anything? (female singing over tinkling music) (both laugh) (Leigh breathes heavily) (bell rings) (alarm wails) (Guy sighs) Whoa, whoa, just let me handle this one. Hi. - [Agnes] Hi! Hi, hello. - [Guy] Can I help you? - [Agnes] Is he here? - [Guy] Who? - [Agnes] Who? Carl. Is Carl here? My husband Carl. - [Guy] Uh... - [Agnes] You don't know. I know how it works. Look, go get Carl, bring him out here, and tell him his wife, Agnes, is here to see him. His wife Agnes. (violin music) Carl! Carl! Carl! (Guy murmurs) (Agnes yells) (tense music) - Leigh? - Sometimes I hold my breath, to get away from myself for a moment. I'm scared. - So your essence is literally you. It's blood. - Distilled down to plasma. Takes a lot out of me, but I don't mind. It's a release. - So why just once a month? - Because it only seems shareable in a certain time in my cycle. - How much do you give them? - As much as I can. But they want more. (Guy exhales forcefully) - Ah, come on. - Just wanted you to look at me. (tense music) See me the way I see you. - Show me the gate. Oh, damn! - Look at me, now! (female singing over string music) (gate squeaks) (Guy breathes heavily) (leaves rustle) (keys jingle) (electrical hum dies) (keyboard clicks) (engine starts) (engine dies) - [Guy] Give me your hand. - [Leigh] What are you doing? - [Guy] I want you to have this, for luck. - That's lovely. - Yeah, well... You know, there's plenty of places you can go, and still feel isolated. Why limit yourself to one part of the world, you know? Why limit yourself to one part of life? (Leigh laughs) What? Is that crazy? - No, no, not crazy, just... Just no. No. What did you do in the army? - Told you, Engineer Corp. - That's not what your tattoo says. You were Special Forces. - Airborne. - Why did you lie to me? - I'm not that guy anymore. - What else are you hiding? Why are you giving me this bracelet right now? - It's not safe here. They're coming. - What are you talking about? - I had to appear weak, harmless, to get you to take me in. Pretending to be hypoglycemic was my Trojan Horse. - Why, what... You work for Circe. - I have to disarm that, and then they move in. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. (Leigh breathes heavily) How could you? How could you! You know what they wanna do to me. - Didn't have a choice. Leigh, it was this or court-martial. I couldn't risk going to jail, but now I have a reason to. We can leave, tonight, you and me. I have a plan. - You were the only man, I've ever done anything with. How can I trust anything that you say? - I have a truck by the gate. We don't wanna be here when they come. - How do I know this isn't part of the plan? That you won't just lead me right into their arms? - [Guy] If you stay here, they'll come. - Let them! - Leigh, I can save us. Will you come with me? - How can I trust you? No. (phone vibrates) (phone beeps) - God damn it, I haven't given the signal! What are you doing here? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You all right? What's the matter? - I'm so sorry. It's not your fault. (gun clicks) (Agnes gasps) (dark music) (heart beats) It's over. It's all over. Almost. (gun dry fires repeatedly) - Your husband isn't here. - My husband's dead. Oh, he left this, this suicide note. It's addressed to you. "To my love in the house in the forest." Carl couldn't have you in his life, and so he took it. And now I'll take yours. (tense music) (Leigh screams) (screams and banging from inside house) (gun fires) - Leigh! Leigh! (Leigh screams) Leigh! Leigh... Hey. - She was gonna kill me, she was gonna kill me. I had to do it, - [Guy] It's okay. - [Leigh] I had to do it. - [Guy] Leigh, Leigh... - [Guy] It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. (Leigh sobs) Shh. - You came here to betray me. - But I didn't. Leigh, trust me. It's okay. Leigh, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. (Leigh breathes shakily) It's all right. I have you. - I didn't wanna kill her. - [Guy] I know. I know. They're coming. Destroy the lab. But uh, don't press the other button. - Why not? It's just a deterrent. They're jewels, and nothing more. - Thank God. Ah! - [Leigh] You're hurt. - [Guy] It's fine. - [Leigh] What are we gonna do? - Do you trust me? (female singing) (melancholy orchestral music) - [Colton] I can't believe you had to kill her. - [Guy] It was me or her. - [Colton] I would've preferred you. You were supposed to be perfect. Immune. But you messed up, big time. (EKG monitor beeps) It's a wash. We'll be lucky if her body yields any useable samples. I thought you liked the hunt, Guy? - Yeah, it's your nature. - Thousands in expenses, weeks of hard work, for what? A dead golden goose? - The goose wasn't golden. Its eggs were. - [Colton] Is that all you got to say? - What? No recommendation letter? - Be grateful you're alive and free. (quiet string music) - It worked. - Then keep it. - Buckle up. This'll be another first.
