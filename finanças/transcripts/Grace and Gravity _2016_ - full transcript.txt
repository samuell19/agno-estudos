(SINGING) Yes, Jesus loves me. (SINGING) Yes, Jesus loves me. (SINGING) Yes... (SINGING) ...Jesus loves me. (SINGING) The Bible... (SINGING) ...tells me so. (ALARM BEEPING) (WIND BLOWING) It's time. (ALARM BEEPING IN DISTANCE) (WIND BLOWING) (WIND BLOWING) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (PHONE BUZZES) Hi sweetie, what's up? What time is it there? It's ten o'clock at night. Sun is barely rising here. And you're up already? Yeah, I want to catch that first light. Haa! That's a surprise. Since when do you ever get out of bed this early for anything? Joy, honey, can you hear me? Hello, wha... what's going on? I'm rushing to catch that light. There's this amazing old bridge nearby, but I have to hurry. You have to hurry? Joy, you know I love that stuff. Yeah, I know you love that stuff. It's my only day off, aren't I entitled to a little fun? So you've got your coat? Yeah, of course I have a jacket. Alright. This is England for crying out loud. Yeah, of course I wish you were here. No, of course I can say it. I love you too. (TOILET FLUSHES) Are you there? Don't forget, Jenny's gonna call. What time will she call? I don't know, around one o'clock when she gets back. 1:00 a.m.? What's she doing out until 1:00 a.m.? It's her birthday, John! She's going to go out. Go to a show, go to a club, go to a thing. Joy? Did you even remember it's Jenny's birthday? No, I'm a terrible father. Of course I remembered! Just don't let her down! You promised! Okay? Yes I'm very aware I forgot her birthday last year. Thank you for always bringing that up. Forgive me for being so busy trying to be a godly provider. J... Joy! Joy! Hmmm... I can't help it! I tried! She's the one who wouldn't talk to me after that. Yeah, I know she blames me for everything and you just allow it. I told you, I would never tell her anything about that. Look, I really have to go. Alright, well... Okay. Alright, Bye bye. (CHEERFUL MUSIC) (CHEERFUL MUSIC) (RUNNING WATER) (CAMERA CLICKS) (INTENSIFYING MUSIC) Come on, buddy! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (CAMERA CRASHES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey! Hey! Hey... Just hang on! Hang on! Don't let go! Please! My name is John, John Palmer. I'm American. Oh, great! And you are? Not interested. Oh, the British humor thing. I like it, that's great. And, and your name? Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not telling you that! Then there's no point. I, I'd like to know, I'm interested. Okay, I'll tell you my name if you promise to leave me alone. Come on! Right, I'm Chris, now go. Chris. That's great! We're off to a great start. And so now why don't you just come on down and we can talk. No! No, no! I'll come up. Oh don't, you come up, I jump. No, no, I don't want to see that! I want this! I, I know you think you do but... You don't know what I think! You've no idea, you haven't a clue. So tell me. There's no point. I'm listening. Just five minutes. I, I want to listen. There's nothing to say. I'm gonna climb up. I'm coming! Just, how on earth did you get up here? Just, hold on! Ohhh! Ummpph! Ughh! Weather still good up there? Uhhh! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Mmmm! Ohhh! Not now, Joy... Not now! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Mmmm! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SQUISH!) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SQUISH!) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SIGH) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Oh, please, Lord! I'm coming. Ughhh! Mmmmm! Ohhh! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Hmmmm. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Nggnnnnn! Just wait! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) I'm a little afraid of heights. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Oh, oh! (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Oh, I, oh, oh. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) I'm not going to make it. I'm not going to make it! Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, um, ah, uh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, my foot. Please, help me, Lord. Help me, Lord! Ahh! Ah, come on! Chris! Oh, ah, ah, somebody! Oh, oh, I need your help, please! I can't believe it. Oh, dear Lord! Please, help me, Lord! Oh, ah, please! I can't. Oh. I'm not, ah. Oh, thank you! Ah, Oh, ah, thank you, Lord! Ah, Thank you! Oh, I was going down. Ah, I was out, it was over. Great! I was almost gone. I'll leave you to it. I was. What? Hey, wait! Chris! Chris! Wait! Just five minutes. What about family? What about your friends? There has to be someone. There was someone. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) I'm sorry... (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) What? (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) It's my wife. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) You know how wives can be. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (RINGTONE STOPS) You know, I believe there's a purpose to living. Can I share something with you? Is that what I think it is? See I'm a Christian. Oh, great! What? You are joking, aren't you? No. Ohh... Just what I need! Just let me share this with you. You're really gonna do this, aren't you? Yeah, just listen. It's in Spanish. Oh, ha, they write these things in two languages. I got the Spanish side. Here we go. It says here that there is a creator of the world John, chapter one, verse one; 'In the beginning was the Word 'And the Word was with God and the Word was God.' Amen, bro! I am not your 'bro'. You really don't have a clue, do you? You know about Jesus? Well, good, well. Maybe if you listen, then you'll understand that there's hope. Don't! I, I have to. You have to understand, He can save you. I don't have to understand anything! But... If you just listen, I mean, What have you got to lose? Okay, okay. Buddy 'bro'! Give me your best shot. Give me a gospel. Tell me your 'good news' so I can be another 'jewel in your crown', another 'feather in your witnessing cap'. So you can go back to your Megachurch in Middle America with its Starbucks in the lobby. And you can tell everybody about the poor mixed up Brit who you led to Jesus with your tiny little, scrap of paper, that you'd forgotten was written in Spanish! Yeah, go for it, 'bro'. Okay, sure, whatever you say. Well, in the Bible it says, that, that God made the world perfect. And He made man, and they had a, a perfect loving relationship together. That's how it was meant to be. But then we sinned. Man did wrong things that, that broke that perfect relationship. But God had a plan. He sent Jesus, His one and only begotten Son, to live as a man here on this earth. And He suffered, died on the cross. He rose again and ascended into heaven. Now, His death on the cross, paid the penalty for sin. If you trust on the Lord Jesus and ask Him to forgive you. You will have a brand new relationship with God. And everlasting life. And a friend, who will never fail you. So? What do you think? It's pretty cool isn't it? (CLAPPING) (CLAPPING) I didn't mean to offend you. I Just... I can see you're in need. Not of religion! Christianity isn't religion. It's true faith! It offers real hope. And you think I'm in need of real hope? You're about to jump off a bridge for crying out loud! Yes, and the only reason I haven't is because you won't leave me alone. Well, that's good isn't it? No, no it's not good, it's not good at all! Anyone would jump off this bridge rather than stand here listening to you. Okay, I get it. Excuse me! Why do you Americans always do this? You go in when you're not invited and you cause more harm than good. If I wanted to hear about your faith, I'd ask you. Well, I can't not speak about my faith because it's true. There is a God. And He will judge you. I have to warn you. I'm, I'm compelled. By Christ who lives within me to offer you hope. Oh, He lives within you, does He? You really believe that? You believe in a divine Creator of the universe? Yeah! And Whose decision to cure evil, was to come down and visit our tiny, little, insignificant, speck of a world? And have Himself killed? And then, to cap it all, to come and live with you? It's insulting to the universe. And small minded. Now you're getting personal. Well, what do you expect? Look, I know that you're in despair and that there's real hope. You haven't a clue! The Bible says in the Book of Isaiah, 'For I know the plans I have for you, 'plans for a future and a hope'. That's funny. What? No, I, I, I said it right. Jeremiah. What? It's Jeremiah. Well, I ehh. Written in the 6th century B.C. as a message to the people of Judah in exile in Babylon. Wow, okay, impressive! The man knows his Bible. But what it says is true. God brings hope. Why am I getting drawn into all this? Because you care. It also says, in Jeremiah, 'The Lord has not sent you. 'You persuaded people to trust in lies.' It's not lies. You have to believe on the Lord Jesus. Philip says, in Acts, chapter eight, 'If you believe with all your heart you can be baptized.' And the Ethiopian he is with replies, 'I believe that Jesus is the Son of God.' That's my point exactly! But 'believing that Jesus is the Son of God' is cut out of most Bibles. Well, well, I know there's different translations and I know that not all of them... Do you believe in the Trinity? Amen, I do! The Trinity is only mentioned once and that's in the first Epistle of John. Mmmm. 'For there are three that bear record in heaven 'and these three are one.' And this is cut out of most manuscripts as well, which is proof that the Trinity doesn't exist. No, no, I, I refuse to believe that. But you don't know what you believe, do you? So you can quote the Bible. A bit! Who cares? So could I! But it's just an old story book! You know we've moved on and so have human rights. So I mean how can you believe in a God that condones slavery and stoning to death? (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Well that's convenient. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) It's my wife for crying out loud. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) You're no different to the others. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Hey! Hey! Don't! Hu, ah. Ah, oh. Huh! (SHOES SCUFFLING) Aii, ji, ah, ooo. Jah! Jah! Morning. This is like a bad joke. Say nothing. He's American. Heh... I'm showing him the sights. I'm taking pictures. The view is spectacular. Yankee Doodle Dandy. Ha, ha, ha. Have a nice day! Have a nice day? Have a nice day? Yuh, yuh yoh, yoh! Ooooi yah! You do know there are two sides to every bridge? (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Don't! I have to. You answer it, I jump. It's my daughter! It's her birthday! So, call her back. It's, it's late over there. She's already going to sleep. It's a phone call! (RINGTONE STOPS) Thank you very much. Wonderful. You just wrecked my family. I promised, man. What is it with you and that stupid phone? If your family can't leave you alone for one minute, let alone a few hours or days, you've got a real problem. You're right, you're right! I'll put the phone away. Uhh, let's just talk a little bit more. This can wait. I'm putting it away. (PHONE CHIRPS) It's just a voicemail. I... I'll check it later. Puttin' the phone away. (PHONE CHIRPS) It's my wife, can I? Give me the phone! Give me the phone or I jump. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SHOUTS) Give me the phone! (RINGTONE CONTINUES) (RINGTONE STOPS) Wonderful, you just ruined my life. I may as well jump too. Right, now it's my turn. What's that supposed to mean? Well, so far it's all been about you. Oh, right. Now it's my turn to speak and all you have to do is listen. Whatever you say I got all the time in the world now, buddy. My wife's probably throwing my stuff out the front door as we speak. I used to be a pastor. And I used to be Santa Claus. (IN BRITISH ACCENT) Or is it Father Christmas? I used to believe in all the things that you talked about, but then, I came to my senses. Yeah, well, maybe you didn't truly believe in the first place. Oh, I believed, I believed alright. And then I realized that Christianity is a bigoted and misinformed religion. Blah, blah, blah. Yes, and your genuine lack of care, Jim. It's 'John'. Is living proof of Christianity's hypocrisy. You know you tried to give me hope with happy, clappy, cliches, that you learned at some evangelical seminar. But right here, right now, a suicidal man just wants someone to listen and the best you can come up with is, 'Blah, blah, blah.' Alright, I'm listening. Were you really a pastor? For ten years I was pastor of a church. Wow! It was an old, evangelical church in Liverpool. You know, the Liver birds, football, The Beatles. I got that one. It was only a small church. Forty members. A joke by your American standards. And they were all, misfits. But somehow I believed it all, I was drawn in. I think I was too frightened to question it. What made you change your mind? My wife died. You know, sometimes grief can hurt a guy so deeply that he blames it all on God. No, don't. You have no idea. So tell me. She'll be sorely missed, pastor. But we can rejoice knowing that she's with the Lord in heaven. Carol was well loved by everybody. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) That's okay. Just ignore it. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) How are you holding up, pastor? It's been a pretty good turnout, don't you think? Is there something you want to show me? Oh this? Uhm, well, it can wait. It's just the ahh, the estimate for the church repairs. Here, I'll sign it. Actually it is rather important. Thank you! Life goes on, so to speak. I was free. That's tragic. I hated them all and I walked away. Then what? Then I finally stopped feeling guilty, realized that God didn't exist. For the first time in my life felt, truly free. What happened to your church? Gone. Closed a couple of years later. There's a housing estate there now. Well, I know in my heart that God does exist. So did I! So did I. (ROCK SPLASHES) It's not the way I'd want to go. Are you sure this is high enough to do the job? Mmm, anything over seventy five feet is high enough. Mmm. What if you hit the water? I'll aim for the ground. Oh, that's tough. You'd have to really swing wide. I'll manage. Mm hmm. Honestly, I'm not convinced this is high enough to do the job. I checked on the Internet. It says anything over seventy-five feet is fatal. Seventy five feet, huh? Wow, that's over two seconds before you hit the ground. What? You'll be falling for more than two seconds. The acceleration in gravity is equal to thirty two feet per second squared. Right! Wait! Did you say thirty two feet per second squared? Isn't that thirty two times thirty two? Sort of. You fall about sixteen feet in that first second because you're accelerating from zero to thirty two feet per second in that first second. You'd accelerate to sixty four feet per second in the second second. And for a short time your distance would match your velocity at sixty four feet. How do you know that? Surprise, surprise, I'm an engineer. I've taken my fair share of physics. What if I went head first? Well, you'd definitely hurt yourself. But what if you flipped over and landed feet first? (UPBEAT MUSIC) I think it's going to rain. This is England, it always rains. It was sunny this morning. You guys are always talking about the weather. Are you stereotyping? No, I just noticed it. It's called polite conversation. (IN BRITISH ACCENT) Oh, oh! (IN BRITISH ACCENT) I believe it might rain old boy. (IN BRITISH ACCENT) I could murder a cup of tea, (IN BRITISH ACCENT) ta, ta! At least we're not rude! And all Americans are rude? Well, loud, brash, in your face and, yeah, rude. Then of course there's that whole eating in your car phenomenon. Burgers, hot dogs, doughnuts, all washed down with a drive-thru mega-bucket. What a fantastic contribution to world cuisine that is! Speaking of which, because of you I missed my breakfast this morning. Don't let me keep you. You know when you die it's not the end. You believe in hell? Yes, but you don't. Oh I do, I do. Believe me. This is hell, right here, right now. It doesn't get any worse than this. When I die it ends. The pain, the suffering, the heartache. Snuffed out in a single moment. Hmm, glorious! Now you see if there really was a God, that would be the one thing He got right. That really is the peace that surpasses all understanding. Peace, lasting peace. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (RINGTONE STOPS) Live life and be happy. And if you can't, die quickly and be done. That is so empty, man. Well of course it's empty! But you've never had to face the fear of an empty existence. You've always run away from it. My God delivers me from all my fears. Oh, does he? He gives me true peace. Does he? Well let's just talk about that shall we? So let's find out how He works for you shall we? Tell me about the relationship with your family. It was great until this morning. Joy is a good wife. I love my daughter too. Oh, come on, you sound just like one of the congregation from my old church. Be honest, John. Every family has its problems. Well of course. But what difference does your faith in God make? None! Faith isn't a free pass from pain and problems. Sometimes my faith is the only reason I can carry on. Well, don't tell me you've considered suicide. No! Never! I mean carry on with my work, my church, my family. Your family? Ahh! I told you your perfect Christian family was too good to be true. I never used the word 'perfect'. Your wife doesn't trust you. (LAUGHS) That is a laugh, man. Phoning you every five minutes. So? So. So all those trips away have taken their toll, John. She doesn't trust you. It's personal. Well cheating often is. You're way out of line my friend. Well, that's not very Christian, is it, hmm? You cheated on your wife didn't you, John. I've never cheated on my wife. Oh, come on, you wouldn't be the first guy in the world. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Let me take that! No. I promise. No, no. I won't tell her a thing about you. No! I, I, I promise, on everything I believe in. Just, please! Thank you! Oh, there you are. (RINGING STOPS) Thank you, Lord! Hi, Joy. JOY: Hi, how come you didn't pick up earlier? I, I, I'm sorry, honey. I just, I just wasn't able to. JOY: So what are you up to? I, I'm, I'm on that bridge I told you about. It's late here, Jenny said that she tried calling and you didn't pick up. I know, I know, I promise as soon as we hang up I'll call her. JOY: Is there someone there with you? I, I told you, I'm on that bridge. JOY: You know, there's something going on here, JOY: There's something between us. JOY: Do you love me? Look, Joy, this isn't the right time. JOY: Why do you love me? I... JOY: Hello, can you answer me? Because I choose to. JOY: You choose to? We're Married, Joy. I'm committed to you. I, I love you! Truly I do. Now will you, please? I, I think I really need to call Jenny. JOY: Yeah, make sure you do, you know, we are losing her. I, eh, and when did that begin? You blame me for this, don't you? No! I'm just saying the way it is. JOY: What, you're gonna blame me for it now? I mean... I... JOY: Long distance? JOY: Are you there? Joy? Ah, we're breaking up. JOY: You blame me for this, JOY: Don't you. Can you hear me? Joy? (JOY INAUDIBLE) JOY: Quit being so mean! You said you cared! Hey, I'm not the bad guy here! Since when am I the bad guy? I do care! I care about you, I care about Jenny! I care about every single thing! I care about you. The truth is, if not for you, everything would be fine and happy. You know what, don't be so cruel. I'm cruel? I'm the guy who's trying to fix everything. JOY: I'm sorry, JOY: I've said I'm sorry. It's too late to be sorry. You cheated on me! And every time you look at me, like everything's supposed to be normal, I got to deal with that. Every time I look across the church and there he is all hallelujah, I got to deal with that. Every time you go, 'Oh, honey, I'm cold, put your arm around me.' I gotta think about his arms around you. JOY: I'm sorry, okay? You have no idea, man. JOY: How do you think it feels to me? John? Joy? Hello? Umm, I'm Chris. What? We've not spoken before. Ahh, John's a bit busy at the moment, he'll call you back. Or maybe he won't... Bye. She cheated on me. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (LOCK CLICKS) DOOR SQUEAKS OPEN) (JOHN SIGHS) (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) (JOHN SIGHS (SOBBING) JOY: Help me, how am I gonna tell him? JOY: Tell me what to say. JOY: I don't know what to do now. (JOY SOBBING) JOY: Good job, Joy! Good job! You are so messed up! JOY: He's never gonna forgive me. Not worth it. Joy, are you okay? Said it was just three weeks. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (RINGTONE STOPS) Well, it had to be one way or the other. Said she was lonely because I'm away so much. It's natural. A lot of marriages end that way. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) Let me just answer that. (RINGTONE STOPS) (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (RINGTONE STOPS) John? John! What? Do you want to know what I'd do? No, I don't want to know what you'd do. Well, let me tell you. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) John, (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) I'd do this. (UPBEAT PHONE RINGTONE) (SPLASH) (RINGTONE STOPS) Why would you do that? I really don't think you were helping each other. We were going to make it. I had promises from God. We're gonna work through everything. Perhaps, you should change jobs. No, It's... Runs deeper than that. Why don't you admit you hate her? No! I'll never speak those words. I love my wife, I love her. You're such a rubbish liar. I don't hate my wife. All I ever do is try hard and try to do the right thing and make sacrifices. She does this to me. So you must hate her a little bit. No! I admit there's times when I struggle. Hmm, 'struggle'. Another great Christian word. There's days when I'm angry, that's for sure! What at him? Especially at him. You mean the other guy. Is there another him? Don't tell me there's another him. Hmm. Finally some honesty! I'm not perfect but I sure didn't deserve that. So why don't you divorce her? God hates divorce. But he tolerates fools. I have to love my wife, I have to forgive her and love her. You have to? Why? Because some pastor told you to? Okay, you're right. Sometimes I... ...feel like I hate her. You know, like there's no one I can turn to. It's like, if I just said to people, 'I'm angry.' Like, they'll scatter. As long as I keep that hallelujah smile going, oh, everything's okay! John, how was your trip? Yeah, it went well. Did you miss him? It wasn't so bad, but I'm glad he's home. I tell you, so good to see you. You know, I never told anyone this. My father cheated on my mother. I'll never forget the day he left us. He... I'm just this little boy. He bends down and he says, 'Someday you'll understand.' Well, you know, I don't understand. He was selfish! He left me and he left my mother. I'll never do that to my family. I wish I could erase the pain, but... The pain will never go away. He's always focused on something other than me. And I suppose you were focused on me when you were, uhh... with freckle face. See, he always does that. Am I wrong? Tell me I'm wrong. John, I love you. I love you, too. CHRIS: Divorce her. What? Get rid of her. What about my daughter? Come on, she'll get over it. Huh! You don't know my daughter. If she had any idea what her mom did, oooo, it would just kill her. JOY: No, this is not an accident. You're doing it on purpose, John, you keep coming back to the same place every single time. How about me? Come on! Can you give me a little bit of affection? Just a little bit? I'm still here, aren't I. JOY: You're here? You're here? That's it? JOY: No, you're not here! You're not here! Do you want me to go? I'll go! Dad! Just stop! You act like you hate her. Jenny, there are things that... are you going to help me with her? Jenny's been avoiding me for weeks now. The truth is my life is a lie. Some witness for Christ, I am. Read this. What's this? Read it. Dear Chloe, I'm sorry I've let you down. And I hope that one day you, you'll be able to forgive me. I'm sure in time you'll learn to cope. I miss you. You're a wonderful daughter and I'm sorry we've moved apart. I should have spent more time with you, more time listening. Yes, I really should have listened. I'm sorry I haven't been there for you and I do understand how I upset you so deeply. I miss your mum so much! I hope you find happiness. Live life and be free. Enjoy what you've got every second of every day. I am sorry, truly. Goodbye. With love, always, Dad. Well, that's, that's some letter. I can't stay! Why not, Chloe? I can't live like this. We're different! I know we're different. CHLOE: Look, Mum, I understand what you believe, but I am not a Christian! Perhaps not now, but give it time and you might change your mind. Don't, Mum! Chloe, listen! No! You don't listen to anyone! At least not anyone who thinks differently to you. Chloe, please let's talk. Just five minutes. There is nothing else to say. Wait! I need to tell you something. No, Chris don't. What? Your mum has cancer. (DOOR OPENS) (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (RAIN FALLING) You know Chloe didn't come to her mother's funeral? Well, we all make bad decisions. You can't blame God for that. Cancer is hardly a bad decision! You were right. Yay, finally! No, I'm talking about the weather. You said it was going to start raining. Oh, wow, my camera! Oh, go get it quick, before it gets ruined. I'm not that stupid. (LAUGHS) You cover it up well. You know, don't blame God for my pain. I can't. I don't believe in God. God gets us through our pain. Fairytales get us through our pain, drugs get us through our pain, the occasional large whiskey has often helped me get through my pain. Pleasurable ladies have often kept... Oh, okay, enough. Enough! I know that God loves me. How? How do you know? Er, love is a wonderful thing, if you can find it! But when it's over, it's over. You see people die or betray you, and then what? We're left alone. You'd have me abandon all hope. All false hope. So how can you really know God? You've never heard Him speak, have you? No, not directly. Good, ha, because if you start telling people you're hearing voices, they'll lock you up. If they see me standing on this bridge in the rain, they'll lock me up. (THUNDER RUMBLES) Why don't you try contacting Chloe? You really think I'd be standing here, waiting for you to leave, if I hadn't tried that already? You really love her, don't you? She has no interest in me. She's just as selfish and obstinate as I am. You're not, well, selfish. She hates me. You're her daddy, she loves you. But we haven't spoken in two years. There's no time like the present. No. Hello Chloe, this is your daddy calling. I've missed you so much, I know I haven't handled everything very well, but you're a wonderful daughter. I love you. I know I need to listen more. Okay, enough! Just give it a try. No! The time is now, Chris, now is the time. You're right, now is the time. I need to get higher! Wha? Chris, Chloe needs you. I know she's angry, but, but she needs you, man, I just know it. What do you know? Go back home! Go and save your marriage. I bet she cries herself to sleep every night because of her mom and because of you. I see what you're trying to do. You're trying to distract me and it won't work. We were doing so good down here. I'm more likely to die up here. Ha, you told me that yourself. You're the one who's in control here. So just a few more minutes. No! No, John, I'm done. Ah, uh, I just, Oh! Ah! Oh wow, I, woo ha! Huh! Fist bump, man. Come on 'bro', come on! Give me a good one! Gotcha! Ha ha, where you going to go now? Well, how about this for a fist bump? (SMACK) Ooo. It's like the worst day of my life. Like the worst day? Put your head back. You'd think a guy be entitled to a breakfast on the worst day of his life, but no! Why do you keep checking your watch? The alarm set for the same time she took her last breath. When it goes off, I jump. Whether you're with me or not. What time would that be? Let's leave that as a surprise, shall we? That'd be murder, you know? Sue me! You're a very funny guy. Then untie me. No. So it's your choice. (CLOCK TICKING) Do you want a mint? (IN BRITISH ACCENT) Mmm, lovely! So, why are you here? I think I'm here because God sent me. Hey, I love the way the Lord works! No, I mean why are you here, you know, in the UK? Oh, I'm on a work assignment. I had a day off today. I like to photograph old bridges and buildings. It's just a hobby of mine. You know, this is a famous bridge? It's one of the last remaining wooden truss bridges in all of England. It was built by this eccentric old American guy. He settled here in England. He just wanted to build a bridge. It's funny. There's no meaning, there's no purpose, it doesn't do anything. You guys would call it a 'folly'. Pointless. It's my hobby, I don't know. Everybody has hobbies. Do you have a hobby? Bad question. Shouldn't you really be out preaching the gospel, rather than taking pictures of old bridges? Probably, yeah. I don't know, it's just a hobby of mine. Truth be told, I feel very close to God when I'm out with my camera taking pictures. Yeah, it's nice. (CAMERA'S LOW BATTERY BEEPING) If God exists, why doesn't He send me a sign? I don't know, you're the one who used to be a pastor. You would know better than me. Oh come on, something. Something like, some sort of sign that proves God exists. (PHONE RINGS) (PHONE RINGS) Hello? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yeah. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yep, that's me. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yep. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Hang, hang on a second. Can I? Can I just stop you there? Are you trying to sell me something? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) No, I said, 'Are you trying to sell me something?' (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Right. Well, I won't need life insurance where I'm going. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) No, it's not Florida. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Well, it's none of your business! Listen, at the same time, Can you take me off whatever list it is you've got me on, please? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Well, in that case, can I speak to the manager? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) No, I'd like to speak to the manager, now! (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Hello? Hello? Hello? He told me to drop dead. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! He told you to drop dead! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! You're on the bridge! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, eh! Drop dead! A, Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha! (GASP) A, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Oh, oh, oh! Ohhh! Oooohhh! Ha, ha, ha, oh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha, ahhh! I didn't know you had a cell phone. You mean a mobile phone. Doesn't everyone have one? Yeah. Did you really think that because I'm suicidal I wouldn't have a phone? I don't know. Here. Use it to call your daughter. Go on, call her. I'm not sure I'd know what to say. I'm sure you'll think something. Call her. I'd have to call Joy first 'cuz I don't know her number. It's fine. Ahh, where'd you get this thing, in a museum? (PHONE RINGING) Hi Joy. It's John. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Hi, um, I don't have my phone anymore, so I'm using a... (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) It's a friend of mine's phone. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Oh, it's a real long story. I'll have to tell you when I get home. But, look Joy, I, I need to ask you to forgive me. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) No, no, nothing! I just, please hear me out. I... I just need you to forgive me for the way that I spoke to you earlier. I've been so angry and, and bitter. I've even been angry at God, and I just need to forgive you. So, we can just move on. And something happened today that just, it just made me realize I love you. Yeah, I really do! And... And I just want everything to be better. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yeah, ha... You were a knockout that day. Ha! You're still a knockout! Ha! (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) I just love you very much, honey. I really really do and... Yeah, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, it's just. Let's just put it all behind us. And ahh, (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) And we're just gonna make it all right, okay? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Okay. Okay. Um, can you please text Jenny's number to me? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Okay, text it to this phone. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Alright, alright, I, love you, honey. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Okay, okay, Bye bye. How'd it go? Good. Real good! Well, that was the easy bit. Now you've gotta call your daughter. Oh, she's gonna text me her number. (PHONE RINGS) It, uh. Answer it. (PHONE RINGS) It's from the States. (PHONE RINGS) (PHONE RINGS) Hello? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Hi Jenny. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yeah, I'm sorry but it's very complicated, Jenny. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Jenny, you shouldn't be talking to me like that, I'm your father. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Excuse me for earning a living so that you could have everything you need. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Jenny, (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Jenny, Now you listen to me, your mom tells me you were out at a club last night? What's, what's up with that, Jenny? Since when do you go to a club? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Well, there's a lot wrong with it. You weren't raised that way, Jenny, you're better than that. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yeah, and what do you do at a club? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) You were dancing, dancing today - what tomorrow? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) No, Jenny I trust you, I really, really do. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Jenny, as long as you're living under my roof you're going to abide by... Give me the phone, Give me the phone! (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Give me the...

(MOUTHS) I miss you. I miss you. No, I really do. It's not nice to be away all the time and I just, I really miss you. (MOUTHS) I love you. I love you. I, I mean, I know I haven't been really good at that. Uhm, but it's, it's true, I really, really love you, Jenny. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (MOUTHS) Let's do something together. What do you say we do something together when I get back home? Maybe one of those father daughter dates we used to have? (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. Be like a father, mother, daughter date thing. It'd just be great. And just... (MOUTHS) Happy Birthday. I love you and really, really, happy birthday. (INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE) Okay, bye. Thank you. Just trying to help. What are those cracker things you guys eat? They're, uh, is it Java cookies or? Dunno. You know, they're all spongy on the inside and uh, and they got chocolate on the outside and got a little bit of jam in, in 'em. Oh, ah, Jaffa Cakes. Jaffa Cakes, that's it! Jaffa cakes, ha ha. Jenny'll love Jaffa Cakes! I'm gonna make sure I get her a couple of boxes and bring them home to her. And what about for Joy? Oh, Joy, she's, she's a little tougher. I'm gonna have to go to high street for Joy. You know, Chris, I really have to thank you. What for? You've opened my eyes to a whole lot of things. You know, you're right about me not truly caring about you. I mean, I do now, but, it's like you're, you're not this non-believer that I have to preach to. It's like, you're this really great guy. You chaps, like, really lay it on thick, don't you. You're like this really great guy that Jesus loves. What was Carol like? She was beautiful, gentle, sincere. She was passionate about her views. She always had something to say. She kept me in my place, that's for sure. She was, well, she was extraordinary. She was... ...my rock! Sounds like a wonderful woman. She was. Can I do anything? (WHISPERS) No. (WHISPERS) It's time. Honey, it's too soon! (WHISPERS) Comes to everyone. Chloe should be here. (WHISPERS) It's okay, (WHISPERS) Perhaps she'll come back to us. (WHISPERS) To you. Pushed her too hard. (WHISPERS) Keep trusting. He'll guide and protect the family. I'm not sure I can anymore. Everyone has doubts. And how can I trust in a God that allows so much pain? (WHISPERS) I'm scared. (SINGING IN A WHISPER) Jesus loves me this I Know, (SINGING IN A WHISPER) For the Bible tells me s... (SINGING) Yes, Jesus loves me, (SINGING) Yes, Jesus loves me, (SINGING) Yes... Jesus loves me, (SINGING) The Bible... tells me so. (ALARM BEEPING) It's time. (ALARM BEEPING) Look Chris, I, I don't have answers for all your pain and everything. I don't have answers for my own life. But we figured something out together today haven't we? I mean, you don't believe in God. Okay. (EXHALES) I'm not going to argue with you. But I am going to tell you that I do believe in Him. Maybe I can't explain it right, maybe I don't understand it all. And I believe that He's good. And He's done amazing things in my life. Maybe I messed a lot of it up and everything but but He's just done amazing things and, and Carol knew that. (SINGING) Jesus loves me this I know. She didn't know what she was saying. She did know what she was saying. The Lord loved her, man. He took her away from me! So tell me how does this make all that better? What about Chloe? Think about Chloe. You're right, (EXHALES) You're right. I should think about Chloe, and Carol. Everything you said makes, makes sense. (EXHALES) Really? Really. Untie me. You're not playing games with me here, are ya? (LAUGHS) No, I'm tired, I need to rest. Oh, thank you! I'm busting for a pee. Woo, ha, ha, ha. You're telling me, man. I'm ready to explode. Talk about the Lord doing miracles! Shall I go first? Yeah, please. That way. Yeah. Um, well, thank you. I think... Bro hug! Um, I'm going that way. Yeah, You okay? Uhm, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. A bit tired but uhm, I need some rest. So, thank you. Yeah, okay. Um... is there an easier way to get down from here? Uh yeah, uh yeah, sorry, there's a path Take you to your camera. Oh, I see it, yeah, okay. Um, take care. Yeah, you too. Bye. (MUSIC INTENSIFYING) Oh. Ah! (BOTH GRUNTING) Uhh, Ooohh! God help me. (PHONE RINGS) It might be for me. (PHONE RINGS) (PHONE RINGS) It's Chloe! (PHONE RINGS) (PHONE RINGS) Hello, Chloe? No, I'm a friend of your dad's. I'm standing with him on a bridge and he wants to jump and he's very serious. What do you mean again? You should never have come. I had to. The hospital called me. You're my dad and you tried to kill yourself. I love you, Dad. You don't understand. (KEYS CLANG) Well, help me and maybe we can get through this together. It's pointless. Do you think Mum's faith was pointless? Your mum is dead and you were right to leave when you did. I'm sorry I didn't come to Mum's funeral. And you think that's gonna make everything alright? Saying sorry? No Dad, I don't expect anything. I just came to make my peace with you. You were right about me. Was I? I've become a Christian. Well, then you're better off without me. I'm really sorry, Chloe. (INTENSE MUSIC) Goodbye. (INTENSE MUSIC) You had no right! The Lord loves you, man. Don't you preach at me! He wants you to live. But I want to die! Chloe needs you! Go home!

Ah, I told you the bridge wasn't high enough. Ha ha, oh, ah, ah. Oh, ah. I thought you were dead. Whatever it takes. I'm sorry. It's no problem. No really, I'm sorry! Please, forgive me. I've really messed up this time. Urh, uh, Here, put this over you. You gonna call an ambulance? Oh yeah, of course. Uhm, here, ah, got it. Oh, it's so cold. Why is England always so cold? Uhm, when you're out of hospital, we could get together, you know, have a cup of tea. Oh, cup tea sounds really good. And maybe you could help me talk to my daughter. Whatever you need, 'Bro'! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh!, ah! (BOTH LAUGHING)
