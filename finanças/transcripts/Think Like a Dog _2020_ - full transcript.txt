Here, check this. - Wedding video? - Yep, that's right. Where did you get this? Mom was digging through some boxes and when she saw this, she started to cry. So I figured it was important. [DJ] Ladies and gentlemen, it's my great pleasure to introduce for the first time as husband and wife, Ellen and Lukas Reed! [cheering] Ugh! Why do you guys kiss? It's gross. Why do you guys sniff each other's butts? - It's grosser. - Ollie... - [loud licking] - [Oliver laughs] Why do you let a butt-sniffing dog lick your face? Top that, sucker! [laughs] Okay. All joking aside, I highly recommend the butt-sniffing thing. You'd be surprised at what one can learn about a person with one quick whiff. [song playing on video] Huh. What song is this? Mom says it's "their song," whatever that means. Pause. Hit pause. - That's the look! - What look? The love look. It's the look two people share when they're truly in love. Wait a second. We gotta remind them of that feeling! We gotta play them that song! - And make them share that look again! - How? Oh! Genius! Ollie, the dance, it's tomorrow night, right? - Yeah, but how do we get them... - You grow a pair, invite Sophie, guarantee Mom and Dad are gonna show up. How'd you get so smart, Henry? You smell as many butts as I have, you tend to pick up a few things. - Ha! - [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 2019 Tech Summit in China. It is my pleasure to introduce our keynote speaker, - Mr. Ram Mills! - [cheers and applause] ♪ ♪ [speaking Chinese] Confucius, Lao-Tze, the founder of Taoism, Zou Yan, the founder of Naturalism, Zhao Mendong, the list goes on and on. All these great minds had one thing in common. - They all loved chocolate. - [laughter] [laughing] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. They had two things in common. Their ideas were born out of the perfect alignment of body, mind and spirit. In 1893, Alexander Graham Bell said thoughts are formed by electrical disturbances in the brain. Now, imagine using technology to amplify those thoughts before the ego has a chance to manipulate them. Imagine a day being able to extract that perfect alignment, that purity of thought. Ladies and gentlemen, that day was not yesterday. That day is today! [cheering] [Mills] I'm so sorry. That took much longer than I thought. I threw in that "purity of thought" stuff for your benefit. Sir? Well, the work you're doing with Oliver Reed. It'll enable mankind to effortlessly communicate without speaking. It's the reason I first got into this business. I'm not sure I follow. My mother had a stroke while giving birth. I was never able to hear her voice. So, I've had a dream that one day, through science and technology, I'd finally be able to hear her, understand her thoughts, understand her feelings. Although both my parents are healthy, they behave as if they were mute. They talk, but they don't communicate. Mr. Mills. What good is having a voice if you don't speak your truth? Thank you for sharing that. You are a bright young man, Xiao! - Oh, thank you, sir. - [chuckles] But my dad thinks I'm wasting my life. Oh, that's okay. Just be patient. Takes a while for people to understand a visionary. Trust me. He'll come around. - Can I give you one piece of advice? - Of course! Don't share your ideas with anyone. With anyone. Twelve years ago, I told my friend Steve about this phone that I invented that can also play music. We both know what happened with that. I can assure you, there are people watching you right now. Why? Why me? Because you're about to shake up the world! You need anything, you only come to me. I've got a couple of billion dollars' worth of resources. All you have to do is ask. Just promise me one thing. Of course. Keep doing what you're doing, so no other child will have to suffer the way we did. ♪ ♪ Hey, Mr. Mills, it's you! Mr. Mills! Sophie? Nothing would make me happier than having the pleasure of your company... - [Henry] Cut! Ugh! - [sighs] - How did that feel to you? - [barks] [barking continues] Frenchie feels, and I agree, it just didn't sound like you. Felt derivative. Let's run it again. - I can't do this. - Can't do What, Ollie? Save our family? You know What? Let's just forget my entire brilliant plan because you're too nervous to talk to a girl. Sound good? That's a wrap, everyone! [exhales sharply] You've got one more day to ask Sophie to the dance. I believe in you. - You are ready to go off-leash. - You think? I know. And there's another thing I know. That's checkmate, sucka! All this winning makes me thirsty! - Have I ever beaten you? - At chess? No. At the 100 yard dash? Again, no. But I'm sure there must be... Oh, hang on. Still thirsty. There must be something that humans are better at than dogs. Oh! Are there any contests to see who has the worst sense of smell? You guys would be shoo-ins for that. Now, listen. Starting tomorrow, you say what you feel and you speak from your heart, no matter what. [sighs] Okay. I promise, if you do that, Sophie will say yes, Mom and Dad will show up, and voilà! Let them hear you bark! - [Oliver barks, laughs] - [barks] This house is so small, I gotta stick my head out to change my mind. - We'll fix that. - Don't say fix to a dog. - Not cool. - [cell phone beeps] Hey! I've just met with Mills. I'm scared people know about our satellite connection. - Who knows? - Not sure. But Mills warned me to be very, very careful. We need to shut down the link. - No, we can't. - We have to! My parents are deciding if they're gonna split up or not in two days. I need Henry to help me fix this. Henry? How can he help? Adults are complicated, but Henry's simple. [Henry] Your face is simple. I just mean he has a simple view of life, a better View. Xiao, please. I can't let my family split up. Please, just 24 hours and then I promise I'll make this right. I'll confess. I'll do whatever I need to. You've got one day, but that's it. - [exhales sharply] - [phone beeps] [sighs, exhales forcefully] [Cindy] So this house isn't officially on the market, but I know people, and these people are getting a divorce. This house could be yours! - [Mr. McLelland] That's great news! - [yelps] - Honey, are you okay? - Oh, my gosh! [Henry laughing] No hard feelings, I hope. It's nothing personal. Scratch that, it's totally personal. - Are you okay? - She's fine. She's fine. Okay, great. Wait 'til you see this kitchen. It's amazing. It's really beautiful. [Mrs. McLelland] Well. [farting loudly] - [sniffs] What is that smell? - What smell? [giggles] That's the smell of zero commission. - [inhaling] - Oh, that smell. [Cindy] Ugh! Well, that's the kitchen. Isn't it pretty? It's bright... Do you wanna see the backyard? Well, they're still in the kitchen. Hey, do you remember that time Ollie was riding his bike and he fell off and he banged up his knee? Yeah. Remember what he said? He was like, "I'm not gonna cry!" [Lukas laughs] He was a tough kid. Still is. Tell me that he's gonna be okay. He's gonna be fine. Okay? We're just gonna keep loving him just like we always have. No matter What. [sighs] I'm sorry, Ellen, I just... I feel like I could've done better. We both could have. I love you. - I love you. - [door opens] Wait! Wait! No, no! I forgot to give you my card! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and... Oliver, don't forget the character's name is Juliet, not Sophie. [kids laughing] [Ms. Shackley] I tell you what. You could say the actual words, or blurt out whatever you're thinking. [laughing] Okay. Here's what I'm thinking. How many of you understand this play? - I mean, really get it? - No. Do you understand it? - Of course I do. I'm teaching it. - Are you? [kids] Oh! I don't think anyone here really gets it. Well, the material might have more meaning to you if you took the time to actually study it. Or if you took the time to actually explain it. You know, teach it to us. So we can appreciate its meaning. - Shall I continue? - I think so. In the principal's office. - [kid 1] All right, Oliver! - [kid 2] Go, Oliver! - [kid 3] Yeah! - [cheering continues] - [doorbell rings] - [Muñoz] Wait! - What's our cover? - I got this. - Just follow my lead. - What? Hi! You must be Mr. and Mrs... Masculine? - Did I pronounce that correctly? - Close! My name is Bailarín Masculino. And this is my wife, Fauna Flora. She does not speak English, but she is a dancer. And when she dances, she speaks the language of love. Venga aquí. Oh, okay. So, this is their son's room. If there was ever a room for a baby dancer, this would be it. Distract her. I'll do recon. My wife, she love the house. I must speak with you. [Li] Oliver! Oliver! That was the most amazing thing I've ever seen. - What's gotten into you? - I don't know. I guess I just wanted to say what I was really thinking for once. Well, you should do it more often, because everybody's talking about it. - Seriously? - Are you kidding me? You're like a legend! And there will be spillover cred. And I'll be by your side, so your spillover will spill over to me Hi, Li. Hey, Oliver. Li's me. You know my name? Of course. You played Juliet in class. It's happening. It's already happening! The spillage is real! See you later, Li. Oliver, what you said in class is exactly what I've been thinking. That was really brave. [bell rings] Well, gotta go. - Sophie? - Yes, Ollie? Sophie... would you please go to the dance with me? [chuckles] I would love to. [chuckles] See you tonight, Romeo. Hey, Oliver. You got a minute? I guess. [sighs] Nicholas paid me to tank your experiment. - Seriously? - Yeah. Listen, man. I've felt like crap since the fair. And then after you stood up to Ms. Shackley, well, dude, you deserve to know the truth. Thanks. Are you gonna tell Nicholas that I told you? Nope. It wouldn't be cool, would it? See you at the dance, man. Yes, you will. - So, you wanted to talk to me? - Yes. Your eyes, they are so sad because you have not been loved the way an angel like you should be loved. Okay... Don't speak. Don't think. Follow. [instrumental tango playing] Does this thing turn on? Hey, Oliver. Listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't be there to give this to you in person, but I'm about to give the keynote speech at the Tech Summit in China. [tango continues playing] - Nice. - Honey, it's time to go. - Oh. - [Cindy] Wait. - I thought she didn't speak English! - She's a fast learner! Nice house! Wait! I forgot to give you my card! ♪ ♪ From a rooftop in Beijing to an oil rig in the Alaskan Gulf, we are bound by the thirst for knowledge. Mills Lab's new XM Quantum Book will give you access to anything you can imagine faster than... well, faster than you can imagine it. - [chuckles] - [director] Cut! Oh, Xiao. [speaks Chinese] - Oh, man! - [Mills laughs] This was so freaking cool. - Well, I am so glad to see you. - Me, too. Tell me, how long have you been a bicycle delivery boy? How did you know that? I know stuff. Come on. - [birds chirping] - [Oliver] You were so right, Henry. I did what you said. In class, I spoke from the heart, and it felt amazing! - Well, duh. - I've never felt this-this grown up. Pretty soon you'll be shaving, driving, kissing girls... Still gross. Oh! Henry, um... when you said dogs don't have divorce, - do they have marriage? - Nothing official. We do more of a common law thing. - What about family? - Family we have, and love we have. But once you're family, you are always family. - And that never changes. - [transmitter kicks in] Okay, pop quiz. What are the two most important things in life? - [device ringing] - [Oliver] Love and family. Oh! And peeing Wherever you want, which is awesome. - Do you actually? - Oh, my God. - Are you messing With me? - It works. That doesn't really make sense. So, you ready for this? You gonna get the 'rents to the dance? Yep. Both at the same time. They'll be coming at exactly 9:30. And the DJ's on board? He'll have the song cued up and ready to play? - Done. - Impressive. Oliver Reed, you are ready to live off-leash! Thanks, Henry. I love you, too. Now, if you wanna look sharp for the dance, you go with that tasty blue number with the dots. - You mean this one? - Bingo. - Stylin'. - [laughs] You know, one of the things that I love about your country is you guys can use an app to pay for everything. - Yeah... - You don't even need to use cash. Can you show me how that works, please? Sure. It's simple. - You just need to... - [alert dings] What is this? What did you do? It's nothing. Look, I more than anyone know how difficult it is starting out. I just wanted to make it a little easier for you. Mr. Mills, I don't know what to say. When you and Oliver achieve your goal, you won't have to say anything. I'll already know what you're thinking. Sir, without Oliver, none of this could be possible. Oliver created this technology for his family. You cannot buy that. [bugle charge ringtone playing] Excuse me. ♪ ♪ - Bridget. Go. - Sir, it works. It's real. I don't know how, but he did it. Do you know what it'd mean if... when I get my hands on this technology? You'll get another island? A bigger yacht? Oh, simple, simple, Bridget. For once, just try to think like a genius. With this technology, I'll know exactly what my competitors are thinking. Every brilliant idea will be mine. I'll have a monopoly on knowledge. Sir, that-that does have a nice ring to it. Okay, I'm going to have to pay Oliver and his talking dog a little visit. Oh, and good job, simple Bridget. Expect something special for your bonus this year. How 'bout Mills Labs? Mm? ♪ ♪ [cell phone rings] - Yes? - [Rockford] Great recon, Muñoz. That laptop's proved invaluable. Thank you, sir. Intel have informed us that Mills has transferred $100,000 into the bank account of a potential operative in Beijing. The FBI have been notified. Good work, Muñoz. Does this mean we have corroboration? We have corroboration. This is Jason Bourne stuff, and I'm Matt Damon! - That's so you. - [laughs] [Henry] Make way for the total package! Brains, personality, and good looks! Oh, and Ollie, too. - Wow, you look cute! - Whoa! Look at you! - Somebody's handsome. - Thanks. - You don't think I look a little... - Gorgeous? - No, just kinda... - Irresistible? Well, that is what I'm going for. - [Ellen chuckles] - [sighs] Oh! You know how you always say that we can learn so much from observing someone else's behavior? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Yeah. I think we can learn a lot from observing Henry. Maybe not right now. Oh, a little privacy, please. But, haven't you noticed how he seems happy, like, all the time? Dogs always seem happy. - Because they are! - [Henry] Because they are! - Jinx. - Jinx. What? Jinx? Henry and I were just talking. - Zip it. - And he talked back? Nix-nay on the alking-tay. Remember? Criminally insane? Never mind. The point is, they're happy because they appreciate the simple things in life. The important things, like love and family. They don't complicate life the way people do. I am impressive. I can appreciate the sentiment, Ollie, but when you get older, life just isn't that simple. - But it can be. - Sell it, my brother. See, people are always so busy searching for a better life, they forget about the great one they already have. Oh! Look what I found under my bed. We had some great trips in that thing. Well, I don't wanna be late for the dance. You're a closer. Wait, baby, do you want a ride? Mom, it's six blocks. I'd rather walk. Plus, I could use the time emotionally preparing for my... - date. - Boom! Nailed it! - What? - When did that happen? - Earlier today. - Who's the lucky girl? Her name's Sophie. And get this... she likes me for me. Well, yeah. I mean... I don't wanna be late. I hear girls like punctuality. You know what else they like? Confident dancers. Dad, no, please, please stop. That, right there, that makes me proud to be a dog. - I will never unsee that. - [Ellen] Oh, God. - I'm just telling you. - I get it. - I should really go. - All right, hotshot. - Call me and I'll come get you. - Or me. - You know, whatever you want. - Just...
