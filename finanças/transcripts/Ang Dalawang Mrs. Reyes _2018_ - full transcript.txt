"The Two Mrs Reyes" You took these pictures? What, you followed them? You have a lot of free time, huh? I hired a private investigator. Wow, you hired a PI... ...to have my husband followed... ...and you didn't even tell me? If I did, will you allow me? I don't see anything wrong if they go out together. They're officemates. Mother-father, that was years ago. Gary has been a freelancer for years. Look, you think your husband will not take notice of her breasts? Damn those boobs. They're a menace to women. What more do you need... ...for you to believe that Gary is not loyal to you? There is none. I already had a feeling that Gary is hiding something. I just don't want to confront him. Because I know, I'm also at fault. Let's finish this. Okay, Dad. Try the cakes, they're good. Lianne, Lianne, wait. I'm always busy, I'm always working. Hi, glad you could come. But I try make it up for them. - Are you okay, honey? - Yes, Mom. - Oh, sir, you can put it here. - Yes, ma'am. And I made your favorite salad. I know I've been very busy lately. I'm so sorry and I'll really make it up to you both. We need to leave. The sun is about to set. Oh, okay. Let's go. - Let's go, Mom. - Please bring the food on board. - I wanna take photos for my IG. - Yes, yes. Go, honey. - Please don't forget the food. - Yes, ma'am. Wait, honey, I'll just have to take this. Hello? Yes, Martina? Hi. What? Oh, my God, how's the patient? Okay, okay. Okay, I'm on my way, bye. Hon, I need to go back. I need to go to my patient. I'm really sorry. Sweetheart, take lots of photos and send it to me, okay? - I'll see you at home. Bye. - Okay, Mom. Hon... I neglected my family. Especially Gary. I'll forgive him and I'll also ask for forgiveness. We'll start over again. Lianne. Lianne. - Lianne. - Yes? Are you sure about this? This is it? There's nothing bigger than this? There is... ...at the market. Would you like me put watermelon instead? I'm serious. I want... ...big, like... Are you and Gary having problems? What? Just because I want an augmentation, it doesn't mean that we're having problems. Can't I have it? Okay, I'm sorry. For your information, Gary and I are perfectly happy. Oh, that's good to hear. So when do you want me to schedule you in? The OR doesn't have any schedules, right? Let's do it now. Mom said that in order to keep your husband happy, you need to satisfy him. Starting with good food. Mimi. Mimi. Mimi. What do you like? Mimi. Do you like it? She says it's delicious. Second, satisfy him with lots of care. The third and most important thing is satisfy them in bed. Babe. What are you doing? You are scaring the cat. - Now I'm your pussy... - What? ...and you're Felix. - Felix the mark. - No! Oh, my God. I'm so... I'm so sorry, babe. Sorry. Babe, what are you doing? Okay. Nice. All right. I like that, babe. Babe. - What's wrong? What's happening? - It's too tight. - I can't breathe. - What's wrong? Motherfucker, it's too tight. - I can't breathe. - You can't breathe? Wait, wait, wait. - Here, here. - I can't breathe. Nothing happened? The costume was ripped? You know what, Cindy? I'm getting impatient. I'm not getting any younger. I want to have a grandchild. Yes, Mom. You know what? If there's one thing about you that I like is that you're very hard working. That's why when you and my son liked one another, I said to myself... ...not that bad. Though you did not come from a rich family, you have a good heart. And most importantly, hardworking. Thank you, Mom. And Cindy... ...this time, you have to try harder. If you need to have sex everyday, do it. I want a grandchild. Yes, Mom. Mommy, what happened? Did you get a breast enlargement? Just a little. Are you and Dad having problems? Well, Macey, I also asked the same question. Was that reason he went to the province? No, sweetheart, okay? Dad went to the province to help your grandmother... ...in renovating their hotel. He'll return tomorrow, okay? Now don't worry. Go up to your room, you still have class tomorrow. Go. Goodnight. - Yes. Goodnight, Mommy. - Okay. Okay, I'll go ahead. Are you okay? Happy? Thank you. You're welcome. Enjoy your new boobs. But be careful. Don't use it yet for procreation. You know the drill. Don't get them wet... ...and do not raise your arms above your shoulders, okay? You know that you still have stitches. "Town Plaza" In fairness... Hey. Look what I found for you. Try it. We'll have the same dress, Mom. Yes, it's called "twinning". It should be fun. I wanna see my son before I leave for LA. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us together. All right, go. Try this on. Hello? Macey? Hon? Hon. Where's everyone? Don't worry, Hon. They'll be back later. Oh, my God. "Oh, my God"? Really? So for all of these, "oh, my God" is all you can say? Hon. What...? What happened to you? Were you in an accident? What are you talking about? Sweetie-pie, these are all for you. Don't you like it? Come on, touch them. Wait a minute. Don't press too hard, 'cause I just gave birth to them. I want you to meet, Ningning and Gingging. - Touch it. - Why did you do...? Caress it. - You have to massage them. - No, Hon, no. Why are you doing this? For you. This is what you want, right? What are you talking about? Tonette. Your so-called officemate. I know everything about you and Tonette. I understand. But we're just friends. Oh, please, can you be honest with me? I had an implant just for this moment. Don't you see? They're bigger, they're better, and stronger than ever before. - I so love you. - Hang on, wait... No! Look... I'm sorry, Hon. Hon, grab my hand. - Grab my hand. - It hurts. Sorry... - It stings. - Come here. - Give me your hand. - No, no, no... - Okay, come here. - My stitches. No! No! - Give me your hand. - Don't... - Come on. - No... I hate you! Motherfucker, you fainted? Manang! Wow, you both look so terrific. What did I tell you? I told you, your husband will be happy. At least, it looks good on her, right? Hon. You've cooked another delicious feast. However, it needs a little salt. Mom. Are you and dad really gonna stay in LA for three months? So you'll miss mommy? Do you want mommy to come back sooner? No, no, no. No, don't worry. I'll take care of Felix. I'll take care of him. Take all the time that you need. You need to go on vacation sometimes, right? Let's eat. What's happening? You wife idolizes me so much. She's doing everything I do. It's always me. She'll be okay. Thank you, doc. Let's go. Hon. Are you okay? Yes. I'm just singing them a lullaby. They can't sleep. "They"? The twins. Our twins. Twins? My goodness. It's Gingging and Ningning. Our babies. Say hi to daddy. Hi, Daddy. They said, "Hi." - Hi. - Hi. They can't sleep. I'll sing them a song while tapping them. Hon. I think this is the best time for me to tell you. Tonette and I... We're really just friends. The reason why we always hangout is... ...she's my confidant. And she'll never judge me. Hon. I'm gay. You're right. I do have an affair... ...but not with Tonette. It's with another man. You really had to tell me this... ...when... ...I'm anesthetized. Hon. I love him so much. And I never felt so much love for anyone. That's why I really need to say this. You really have to say this now? I want to hurt you. I want to shout. I want to slap you face, you moron. - Now... - Hon. - You admit this right now? - Hon, are you mad? Daddy. Gary... - Gary... - How long have you been standing there? Gary... Gary, you fool. - I'm sorry. - Gary, come back here. Take care of your mom. Gary, come back. I will kill you. Take her home once she can talk properly. Gary. Gary, come back here. Gary... - Fuck you. - Mommy, Mommy. - Gary... - Stop it, Mom. Okay, I'll go ahead. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Okay. Bye. Oh, by the way, Cindy. If something happens to my son... ...you'll answer to me. What? You're threatening me? Bye-bye. Yeah. Give me time to tell her... Babe. Problem at work? Yeah. What else is new? Well, why don't you resign? Your mom said that she offered you money as a starting capital... ...for you to build your own firm... 322 00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.017 ...but you declined. You know, what, babe? You should learn how to say no to mom. The whole time, you feel uncomfortable with your outfit. She wanted me to wear it. So I let her. Besides... ...it's fine with me. How about what you want? Sometimes we say it's okay... ...but the truth it's not. And then you'll feel suffocated. And then, one day... ...you'll realize that everything's gone too far. You'll suddenly give up. Well, I was thinking... ...if mom wants this... ...you probably like this as well. I'm only doing this for you. Why are you so nice to me, babe? Because... ...I'm so lucky to have you. How are you feeling? My God. It hurts. Do you want more painkiller? Manang said that last night, you were high because of those. Everything that I reminded you not to do, you did it. Oh, my God. Stop scolding me. My head hurts. What drug did they give me? I dreamed of different things. I dreamed that... ...I was talking to my boobs. What's worst, Gary was gay. Oh, my God. Lianne. One of the things you mentioned... ...is true. What? My boobs are talking? No. Yes. No. Yes. No. We have to talk. Remove these from me. - Lianne, Lianne. - Ma'am. - Lianne, stop. Listen. - Don't do it, ma'am. What's wrong with you? One of your maids messaged Manang... ...and said that after Gary dropped off Macey, he packed all his stuff. He's gone. He left you. No. - No. - Ma'am. No. Babe? Babe. You're jealous, aren't you? What's this? Love letter? What's this, a novel? Dear Cindy. "I tried to write this letter so many times over the last three months." In order to explain myself, I need to start from the very beginning. My earliest memory was when I was 5 years old. Oh, babe. What? You said a lot of things. You even told me your life story. And then you'll leave me. The subscriber cannot be reached. Please try again later. Fuck you! He didn't say anything to me. How come I don't know anything? All this time, he's making a fool out of me. Sis, do you think he went into transition? You know, the sexuality of a person nowadays is different. Just because they're gay, doesn't mean they were born gay. Where did you get that idea? In Facebook? Don't believe in everything you read. Take my aunt for example, when my uncle decided to date other women... ...she became a tomboy. She wasn't like that before. So are you saying Gary can go both ways? Gender fluid. Gender queer. Pan-sexual. Try to Google it. There's a lot of those. What? It doesn't matter what Gary's sexuality is. He left Lianne. That's it. True. If he doesn't like you, then let him be. End it. Move on. Let go. I still love him. I wanna talk to him. Do you want to contact the detective that I hired? Why don't you give her a hug? This is a friendship moment. Okay, I just want to ask this. Lianne said she wants to talk to Gary. Do you think there's something to resolve? So do you think he really wants to talk? Do you think you can win him back if you guys talk? I mean, at one point during our single lives, we've separated from a lot of our ex-boyfriends, we've rejected a lot of men. And all of them only wanted one thing, to talk about it. Did we really want to talk to them? Of course not. But since we pity them, we granted their request. I used to meet my ex-boyfriends at Ma Mon Luk in Quiapo. There were always a lot of people. A lot of customers. While you're eating, someone is already waiting for you to vacant your seat. That's why we need to talk quickly... ...because whatever they tell you, you've made up your mind. Because you're no longer interested. So go ahead and meet up with Gary, talk to him, but be prepared... ...because he's no longer interested. Okay? Group hug. No. After everything you've just said, you want a group hug? I thought it was just a phase. "Phase". "Was just a phase" my ass. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't want to be mocked. I don't want my parents to be disappointed. But I don't want to live the rest of my life being scared. I cannot give you the love you deserve. I met a guy. We're in love. "But the most loving thing for me to do..." "...is to leave you and set you free." "I'm really sorry." Fuck you. Even though you're good in English, you're still a moron. You fooled me. Why did you even court me? Why...? Why...? Why did you propose to me? Why? Why did you have sex with me? Sex was good, but why? I don't understand. Mimi, tell me, if he's gay, how can he have sex with me? How? The question is how many times do you have sex in a year? Two. Well, three, if we're lucky. And you're still wondering? Hold on. How come you're able to speak? Ashley. That's me. Is this really your name? I'm sorry for asking. Are you gay? Mrs Reyes, does it matter if I'm gay? Well, actually, I'm paying you as an investigator. Don't you think I have the right to know? Okay, well, if you must know, in my mind, I'm trying to undress you. I'm trying to focus on your eyes, but my eyes keeps on wandering towards your... boobs. So can we get back to the topic at hand? Yes, of course. Remember him? Of course. My friend asked you to investigate him. Based on the photos that you've taken... ...it seemed that he was having an affair with a female co-worker. But it turned out... ...he's having an affair with a man. Interesting. He hasn't come home for two weeks and I want you to find him. I have a hunch that he's with that guy. I want to know where they are. I want to know who that person is. I will do my best, Mrs Reyes. Thank you. Your husband is really good looking. In fair! - Ready? - Let's go. Let's go. What was that? You really can't wait, huh? Wait. Lianne, please, I'm begging you. Don't say anything to Nico. Of course not. But my point is, you and your husband are having problems and you didn't tell me? Actually... ...none, we're okay. You're okay? You're seeing another man, you're okay? Maybe this is just a phase. I want to explore. It's not like I'm leaving my husband. Oh, my God, I cannot believe that's coming from you, Betsy. Why? Do you think only men can do this? It's not an issue if it was the husband or wife that had an affair. The issue is you're having an affair, period. And to think you're so mad at Gary because he's having an affair. What makes you different? Mother-father. Come on, Lianne. Get off your high horse. You also did it, right? You were having an affair with your job. That's why you can't give time to your family. Well, you know, what? If you've given your time to Gary... ...he might not left you for a guy. Babe, let's go. Elaine. Ma'am? Did Felix come to work? He already resigned, ma'am. It was all of a sudden. Didn't you know? I know. I'm just kidding. So why are you here? Oh, you're here for his things. He was in such a rush when he left. Yes. I'm here to get his things. I'll bring it home. Okay. He resigned? - Here. Yes. - This is it? He really left this. That fag. What was that? I said, thank you, fag. Mimi? What the... "GarFel" Is this the one? Is this the one that you fell in love with? Motherfucker. You... If you're a prominent person... ...I can find you. I can find out all about you. "Newest Derm Clinic In Town by Dra. Reyes" Gotcha! Ma'am, you cannot go in there. She'll fire me... - Ma'am... - I'm sorry. What's happening? Doc, she wants to talk to you, but she doesn't want an appointment. Do I know you? I'm Mrs Reyes. I'm the wife of your husband's husband. But you can call me Cindy. It's okay, thank you. Please leave us. Okay, ma'am. Yes, just call me Lianne. I'm sorry, but I'm still comprehending on what you said. What makes you think... ...that it was my husband who stole your husband to be his husband? Can't it be your husband stole my husband to be his husband? What? The point is, they're both deceiving us. This is your husband, right? So you have no idea that your husband is gay? I know... ...but in theory. Reality is different. I still can't accept it. How long have you been married? Fifteen years. We have a teenager. How about you guys? Five years. But we don't have kids. I guess it's a blessing in disguise. You know what? I really don't know how to help you with this one. I don't even know where Gary is. Anyway... ...I'll give you my calling card so that you can call me. I just want to talk to my husband. You still want to reconcile with him? Actually, I just want to be enlightened. What makes you think... ...that they can explain everything to us in one sitting? No, I don't care. Let them explain. They can do it everyday or even if we reach judgment day. Those imbeciles... Do we have to feel sad or cry, while they are happy together? That can't be. They have no right to be happy. They cannot celebrate Christmas, New Year, and Valentine's Day... ...until we say so. Until we give the go signal, no one will be happy. Okay. Thank you again. Yes, Ashley? Cindy. Cindy. Wow, are those real? Yes, they're real. You went after me just to ask if my breasts are real? Your boobs are already big. Are we competing who has the biggest boobs? Anyway, do you have plans today? Nothing really but I do need to buy cat food. Why do you ask? I'll go with you. The private investigator I hired just called. Are you ready to face our husbands? I checked their names with several establishment registries... ...and their names popped up in a gym registry. I went to the gym, but they were on their way out. This is where I followed them. Quickly, let's go inside. There they are. Aren't they cute? Because of that, you stay here. What? Cindy. Lianne. You still know our names? We thought you both had amnesia. What brings you here? Why are you together? Surprise. We are the answer to your prayers. The Lord said... ...before you pray for the legalization of same sex marriage... ...you need to talk and explain to us first. I know... ...we have a lot of explaining to do. Oh, yes. You have a lot to explain... ...and you better start now before I put you inside this casket. "Ma Mon Luk" It really has to be here. No other place? Does it really have to be in Ma Mon Luk? We wanted to reach out to you... ...but we're both cowards. We're ashamed because we know that what we did was wrong. Ashamed? Really? Look at you. You're even wearing the same shirts. That's called twinning. You should tell the whole world that you're a couple. Why Gary? It was so easy for you to throw everything away. I know I may not be the best wife but... ...I love you with all that I have... ...and I really tried. I know. That's why I feel belittled. Because even though you're busy... ...you tried to be a good wife. And an even better mother. But... ...I can't find... ...any other way... ...to explain what happened, except that... ...I fooled you. I fooled myself. You... ...took advantage of everything. You took the opportunity when I had painkillers in me. That's where you tell me that you're gay. You didn't even gave me a chance to react. Yes, you did react. You said to me... "I want to scream." "I want to hurt you." - Oh, my God. I really wanna hit him. - "I want to slap you." "You moron." "Moron." Believe me. I've tried everything... ...to make our marriage work. For 14 years, I hid my identity. It was hard for me. But then... ...I met Felix. He saved me. He gave me strength to be true with myself. What about Macey? What will I tell her? Nothing. What do you mean "nothing"? That can't be. You can't just ignore that fact. What I mean is I've talked to her. And she's okay. She's more matured than you think. You're lying. - Call her. - I will. Felix. Tell me the truth. Did you marry me out of convenience? Because I'm your mom's secretary? I loved you. But you're gay. No. - No? - No? But you wrote that... What I wrote was... ...I met a guy, we're in love. So what are you? Bi? You're bi? Not exactly. So what are you? Hetero-flexible. Straight identifying them bi, but still attracted to the same gender. You know what you are? What you really are? You're a jerk. You're just a jerk! You're married to me. I don't care if you're bi or hetero-gay. It's your responsibility not to be attracted to others, only to me. You let yourself fall for him. I know that... ...saying sorry is not enough, but... ...that's all I have right now. I'm deeply sorry for hurting you this way. What if you stop apologizing? Gary. Is there a slight chance that you're attracted to a woman? But I want to be a woman. What? What? You know... ...you should see him dressed in woman's clothing. I told him, you know... ...just go for it. Go for what? I want... I want to have those. But not that big. Probably like this. You even want to copy my boobs? Look. I identified myself as a woman. If you think Felix left you for a man, you're wrong. I'm also a woman. I'm a woman. So what, am I a tomboy now? I'm getting confused, Cindy. I know this is difficult to accept... ...but it's harder not to. Instead of continuously fooling you, we chose to be truthful. And I hope someday... ...you can be happy for us. So that's why he hates cabbage. Other men like cabbage, but Gary seems allergic to it. Whenever he says a cabbage, he'd sneeze non-stop. Does Felix like cabbage? Are we talking about the vegetable? My God, why are we so stupid? Why didn't we notice this? Why didn't we see it? Because we love them. Who isn't a fool when it comes to love? Ladies and gentlemen, D' Kings. "D'Kings" Is that real? It's like they have a pet snake. Lianne. Of all the places that we can go to get drunk, you chose a gay bar. I want to know how many types of gay are there. What happened? Why all of a sudden there are different variants? They're too many compared with the emojis. Correction, your husband is not gay. He's a woman. I don't care how they label themselves. The bottom line is, they're fooling us. They're fooling us. Exactly. I don't have a problem with gay people. In fact, I have colleagues who are gay. And it's totally fine. I'm a strong supporter of the LGBT community. Ma'am, I think what you're saying is LGBTQQIP2SAA. To sum it up. I'm sorry, LGBTQQ... Q what? IP2SAA. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, inter-sex, pan-sexual... ...two-spirits, asexual allies. Are you serious? The rainbow only has ROYGBIV. That's what my ex-boyfriend told me. Wait a minute, let me guess. You're not straight, you're not gay, and you're not bi. I'm pretty sure you're much more complicated than that. The truth is I'm still a virgin. So you're just gonna eat salad? I'm ovo-lacto vegetarian, ma'am. I don't drink as well. Ma'am, you wanted me to sit with you, but you're seated far from me. I don't bite. I'm harmless. Harmless. That's harmless? That thing can eat a person. That thing has a voice. Are you ladies all right? The penis is talking. Oh, that hurts. Why did you bring them here? They were very drunk. I don't know where they live. Cindy. Cindy. - Hey. - What? Wake up. Mama Doug, why does this porridge have meat in it? Oh, just remove it. Good morning, ma'am. Come, let's eat. Hey, I have visitors. Eat elsewhere. Thank you. Put an egg on it. Hi, come sit here. There. Good morning. This is Mama Doug. Sit. Don't be shy. Sorry, the table hasn't been wiped clean yet. I apologize. Have you seen our bags and cellphones? It's here. The two cellphones. This one's yours. I charged those last night because someone might contact you. Your bags are under the bed. Okay. I'm sorry, what's your name again? My name's Steve. Steve. Did anything... You know, did anything... Did anything happen last night? - You didn't take advantage of us? - Wait. How could he do that when he said he's still a virgin? So? He's still a macho dancer. True. Sorry, no offense meant. No, it's okay. I didn't take advantage of you... - ...because you're like my aunts. - Thank you. You idiot, you should've took advantage of us. And besides, I'm not a call boy. I'm just a dancer at the bar. And I really don't entertain customers on their table. I just made an exception with you two. Because I felt sorry for you. You both looked so sad. So how can you still be a virgin if you're a macho dancer... ...and you told us last night that you have a boyfriend, right? Yeah, I have an online boyfriend. He's a 70-year-old American. We were together for three years. I learned a lot from him. That's sad, but then he's already old, so that's why he died. Seventy years old, he lived a good life. True. Did he die of cancer? Oh, no. Our relationship didn't work. That's how it is. Just like what people say... ..."relationships are like glass." "It's better to leave them broken than..." "...trying to hurt yourself putting it back together." Amazing. I just love quotes. I'm actually posting via Instagram. It's also linked with my accounts in Facebook and Twitter. Here. - You have 11,000 followers? - Yes. Here. - This is my favorite. - Ashley? You have a lot of likes. What? What... Are they renting it? Really? What? They bought a house and they're having a housewarming. Look. Look at it. But... ...it doesn't suit them. They're better off living in the jungle because they're both animals. "Mom calling..." Hi, Mom, Dad. Cindy, I hate surprises. Just tell it to me straight. Are you pregnant? What? Are we gonna be grandparents? I don't understand. Felix has been calling us. He's been telling us to cut short our trip. When I asked why... ...he didn't say anything. He wants to talk to us personally. Cindy, please, tell us. I can't stand the suspense. Tell us, dear, tell us. Then the other furniture and decorations will be delivered... ...but we want it minimalist. I love it. It's very Japanese-inspired. I really, really love it. I also love your furniture. So if I decide to build a house, I want you to do the design. Of course. But before that, look for a boyfriend first. That's correct. Look for a boyfriend. So here it is, I met someone... Excuse me, some guests has arrived. Mom. Dad. What are you doing here? You said we should fly back home. You said you wanted to say something to us. - Can we talk somewhere else? - I didn't want to believe Cindy. I thought she was joking. Until she sent me the invitation. So it's true. You have a relationship with a gay. Who is he? Who is gay here? Me. A gay-like female is included, right? Mace, sweetheart. I have to tell you something. But first, I want to let you know, honey, whatever happens, I'll always be here for you. Mom, if this is about Daddy, don't worry about it. We've talked already. I understand. Yes, he did tell me. But I'm sure you have questions, right? - Like... - No, Mom, I'm okay. Sweetheart, I understand. I know you're suffering deep inside. I know that. I feel you. Mom. I'm really fine. And look... ...I know you're mad at Daddy and you're trying to look for sympathy... ...but Dad explained everything to me. I even met Uncle Felix and he's nice. Nice? Nice? How can you even say that? Macey, he's the reason why this is happening to us. Mom. It wasn't my intention to make you feel bad. I love you both. Please don't expect me to be mad at him also. Please don't make me choose sides... ...because I don't want to lose any of you in my life. Okay. I'm sorry. Mimi. Felix. Hey, what are you doing? You can't take the cat. And why not? You don't like cats. And besides, Mimi doesn't like you. Excuse me. Every since you left us, we bonded. - Give her to me. - Wait, Mimi is mine. No. Give her to me. You cannot have everything. Wait. Is this what it's all about? You want to make me suffer... ...and that's why you even used my parents? How cheap. I thought you're a decent person. Wow. And you had the guts to say the word decent. So you think that what you did to me was decent? We were married for five years. And you've known Gary for how long? Seven years. I'll take Mimi. What do you mean seven years? So when we got married, you and Gary were already a couple? No. It was an on and off thing. We were both in denial for a very long time. But... ...we would seek each other out... ...just to talk, and to spend time with each other. It was the like of love that grew over time. It's also easy and light. And everything about it felt once in a lifetime. So we're now conversing in English? Can I call a friend? "Everything about it was..." Whatever! Thank you for boosting my confidence. I loved you. How many times do I have to tell you that? Why is it in past tense? Why "loved"? - You said you were hetero-gay... - Hetero-flexible. I don't care. The point is, that means that you're still attracted to women. So if it's not my cabbage, then what's our problem? I just don't see myself growing old with you. "Lianne" Hello. Hello, where are you? We have to talk. He doesn't want to be with me anymore, Lianne. What's happening? Felix just left. I feel so little. So little... So little, so little. Market-Market? Do you have to repeat it? Hey, stop it. Pull yourself together. You should not cry, they should be the one to cry. I have a plan. We have to see each other. I'm so sorry. I know it's 2 a.m. already, but this can't wait. Tell her what you found out. Go ahead. Two weeks from now, Gary and Felix will go to Taiwan. This was confirmed by their travel agent. So? Hello? Don't you read any news? Same sex marriage is now legal in Taiwan. They're getting married? They might. In fact, Gary just posted a cryptic message in his Twitter account. "You are cordially invited." Actually, that's it, and then there are rainbows, hearts. Not so cryptic message, right? Wait, this can't happen. I won't allow it. My thoughts exactly. I won't give them that pleasure. Their marriage won't happen. Correct. I'll file a lawsuit. Why file a lawsuit? We're still married to them. We can charge them bigamy. Was there ever a case... ...that the husband was charged of bigamy because he got married to a man? Oh, please. I don't want that. It's stressful. All I want is to see them suffer. The sooner, the better. What will we do? We'll go to Taiwan. We'll follow them to make sure that their marriage won't happen. They won't go back to Manila until they called it quits. How? We'll bring our secret weapon. Oh, and speaking of... He's here. I apologize for being late. You texted me last minute. What's up? In fair. Oh, my God, Lianne. Is that your husband? That fag, he's trying to compete with me. You know what to do. Go. And then? What do you mean? We've talked about this, right? You'll approach them, you'll flirt with them... ...until one of them gives in. Now go. I'm not sure about this, ma'am. I'm shy. Besides, I didn't know that it would be this crowded. Just relax. This is like Disneyland, but for gays. It's the happiest place on earth. Okay, we'll double your fee, now go. Ma'am, it's not about the money. And as one of the quotes go... "...if you're helping someone and you're expecting something in return," "you're doing business, not kindness." Oh, my God. Okay, all right. I get it, I get it. You're an ovo-lacto vegan-virgin- macho dancer... ...that has 11,000 followers and has a golden heart. Please, are you gonna help us or not? Steve, help us. We can't back out now. We've come this far. We can't surrender to them. You're our only hope. Please? - Amazing. - Why? Clueless? Isn't it obvious? Ovo-lactobacilli Shirota strength has a crush on you. Why are you still wearing make-up? We're gonna take a selfie, right? Do you hear anything? No. I can't hear anything. Why don't you push your hair aside? What if this is the wrong room? Ashley paid the travel agent of these two... ...to make sure that we're booked in the adjoining room, okay? How come I can't hear anything? Shit. What if they're having sex and then we'll hear them? No, I can't take that. Open this door. - Hey. - Help me. You're both flirts. - Help me. Why don't you help me? - You're so embarrassing. Babe. I just took a glance at her. That was nothing. The food here is delicious, ma'am. You'll just drink tea? You're hungry? There they are. - Brewed coffee. - By the way, I bumped into them earlier. They're not talking to one another. It's like they have a lover's quarrel. Good. It means our job will be easier. Remember, they're getting married tomorrow. So we only have today to ruin their relationship. I think I'm gonna have a problem. Their relationship seems strong. Whatever flirting that I do, he won't pay attention to me. 1155 01:08:10.201 --> 01:08:11.835 You don't need to be cute. Don't worry, we came prepared. Right, Cindy? Oh, yes. You might have forgotten that we're still their wives. So we know their weaknesses, especially Felix. Let's dance. I'm not in the mood. Wait, are you still mad? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Please? You know that we need to wake up early tomorrow. I'm tired, let's go. Wait, I still want to drink. You have a low alcohol tolerance and might end up vomiting. Let me have that. You're beginning to sound like my mom. Okay, finish that, then let's leave. I'll just go to the toilet. Mimi. Ma'am, I think the T-shirt is effective. He's following me. Just stick to the plan. Divide and conquer. You have to separate them. And then, once you have Felix... Just do everything. Seduce him then you can do anything to him. Huh? What will I do? Ma'am, I'm still a virgin. I can only do spooning. Okay, spooning then. Just make sure you're naked. And Gary needs to see you, okay? Hi. Are you a Filipino? Yeah. Why? Sorry for bothering you, but I just want to know where you got that shirt? I bought this at Baclaran. Really? She looks like my cat. Mimi. Mimi. Oh, Mimi. I miss you... Sorry. I just miss my cat. It's okay, bro. Do you want... ...to hug your cat? It's okay with you? Thank you. Mimi. Felix! Baby. You're so full of shit, Felix. We've risked a lot in this relationship, we've given up a lot of things... ...and the only thing we have right now is each other. - Gary... - But in a span of 10 minutes? I just went to the toilet and you just threw everything out... ...because of your flirting. Gary, wait, wait. Let me explain, okay? - You don't know what really happened. - No, no, no. No, I've made my decision. I don't want to get into another relationship... - ...that is doomed to fail. - Gary. Gary. Wait, Gary. Gary. Really? Lianne, Lianne, Lianne. Your husband returned his engagement ring to my husband. Felix is crying to Steve right now. What about their marriage? It won't happen anymore. Shit! Hello, Steve? Where is he? Hello, Steve. Are you sure? Oh, my God. Okay, you know what to do. He's very vulnerable right now. So you know what to do? I'll call you after we spooned. What? Spooning? Sorry, I was talking with my mom. I feel guilty, because of me, you fought. Look, it's not your fault. You know... ...I just don't understand why he gave up so easily. Now he doesn't want to answer my calls and texts. Sorry. It hurts, you know. Our wedding is supposed to take place tomorrow. I was looking forward to it. You know... ...it took me weeks to find the perfect quote for our vow. Quotation? What quote? I'm into those as well. I might know what it is. It's from Winnie the Pooh. Pooh? The one who impersonates Pacman? No. The bear. - Do you what he said? - What? "If you lived to be 100..." "...I want to live to be 100..." "...minus one day." "So I never have to live a day..." "...without you." Shit. The bear said that? Where is he? Why hasn't he called? Why doesn't he return our call? Did you check his Instagram? Is there a post regarding spooning? None. But he did post something. It's like a Winnie the Pooh quote. Winnie the Pooh? Yeah. The quote goes... "If you lived to be 100, I want to live..." "...100 minus one." "So I won't have to live a day without you." That's from Winnie the Pooh? - It's like Winnie's been hurt before. - It's cute, right? It's so sweet. It's so nice to be in love. But not be left for another. Lianne, in your opinion, what's worst, he left you for a girl or a guy? You know, Cindy... ...if he left me for a girl, it's a simple fight. You just have to be sexy, be beautiful. Then you can have your husband back. But if he left you for another guy, don't you think that hurts enough already? Because you know... ...that from the beginning, you'll lose the battle. Then, you just start questioning yourself. Did he really love you in the first place? I just remembered. Steve. What happened? We've been calling you and you haven't called back. What happened? Hey. Did they call it quits? Did our plan work? Hello? Why won't you say something? What happened? Ma'am... Ma'am, I saw how they deeply love one another. I felt guilty. That's why I helped... ...Felix to get back with Gary. - What? - In fact... ...I was the witness of their marriage. I videoed the ceremony. Here. Watch it. You'll understand what I'm saying. It's wrong to ruin their relationship. I can't believe this. What happened? We had an agreement, right? We even agreed to double your fee. You don't have to pay me. I really won't pay you. Here's your plane ticket. You can fly back home. Alone. I don't want to travel with you. And for your information, I don't ever want to see your face anymore. You're trying to be pure? Virgin, vegan with conscience? Whatever you are, you're still a call boy. Lianne, that's enough. You've gone too far. I'm not a call boy, ma'am. I'm a macho dancer. Lianne. Stop it. I think... ...it's time to admit defeat. - It's over. - No. That's it? Karma doesn't apply to those who left us? I have no idea. Probably none. Nothing's fair in this world, right? And what do we get if we succeed in separating them? Will they go back to us? Will our families be reunited? No. Well, they can't have their own family either. We'll make sure of that. You know, I think our anger has been consuming us already. We have all the right to be mad at them, Cindy. If we're being mad, yes, I agree. But to be bitter for the rest of our life, no, that's not for me. Lianne. The best revenge is to be happy. To live your life for yourself. Wow, where did you get that Instagram quote? From that macho dancer? What's wrong if I got that from him? You're belittling him too much. But the truth is, he has a point. Open your eyes. Even if it's only for now. No. Lily and Felix... ...you are gathered here together to witness... ...the love and respect that you have for each other. Lily and Felix... ...are you entering this marriage with your own free will... ...and without any conditions? - Yes. - Yes. Felix... ...when you walked into my life... ...love walked in. It was a magical moment. I will walk with you. This is an open letter to my gay husband who left me. By Lianne Hildalgo-Reyes. Dear Gary. Congratulations for coming out. I'm sure a lot of people will support you. Applaud you. Because you're brave. You are more than a hero. Against all odds. You married the guy whom you really love. You're an inspiration to those who are still hiding. But way before... ...I'm the only one that you love. But this time, you don't love me anymore. I'm just a part of your past... ...and I no longer mean anything to you. But the truth is, you're not a hero. Because a true hero does not hurt anyone. Especially those whom you're close with. And now... ...I feel the pain when I watched your wedding video with your partner. And just like that, you just threw away our relationship. Everything was like garbage to you. I hope... ...that day will come that a gay like you in hiding... ...will stop using someone to hide their true identity. I want to understand what you went through, but I don't want to pretend. You ruined me. For 15 years, you made me believe that we love each other. However, it was only a one-way relationship. You're a traitor. So that's the reason why my undies have gone missing. You were using it. Are you happy now? Just because you're free. But I... ...was left at the corner, shattered. Shattered than a broken glass... ...because you ruined my life, you jerk. Was it okay? Would it be better if I wrote it in English, so that the foreign press could report it? I was thinking that not a lot of people would like and share it... ...if I don't use our language. Our language is very relatable. Or was I wrong? What makes you say that? You got 50,000 shares in less than 24 hours. Lianne. You should've thought about this. I value my privacy. I don't want the public to make fun of my life. Have you read the comments? People are sympathizing with us. So that was your objective in posting this? To get public sympathy? Go viral? Wait, how old are you again? Are you 16? This is the only way to get back at them. Let's see if that architect can get clients. Can't you see? People are siding with us. So your basis is the number of likes? Lianne, they don't care about us. We're just an entertainment for them. They'll gossip about us until they find our skeletons in our closets. Even the innocent people will be included. Didn't you realize that your daughter can be dragged into this? Are these real people commenting here or is it the devil? How can they say these things to us? They don't even know us. Babe, don't mind them. You will just resent them. Okay, fine, we've hurt them. But do we really deserve this? Look, they even tagged us. Aren't you gonna pack your clothes? Do we really have to go back immediately? Hello, Martina. Yeah, hi. I'll just bring Macey home and then I'll go to the event. Everything's okay there? Okay, all right. Okay, I'll see you. Bye. - Mom. - Yeah? Are you really that mad with Dad? Why? What do you mean? You've been trending since last night. Hashtag, gay husband open letter. I'm guessing that my blockmates already saw the video that you posted. They saw Daddy in drag while getting married to a guy. Probably they're all talking behind my back now. I'm so excited to go to school everyday. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. I know I messed up big time. Is that what happens when you lose your love with someone, Mom? The more you loved, the more you hate? You know what, Macey? Truth is... ...I still love your dad. Very much. It's probably the reason why I did this. You know the feeling when... ...you love someone so much and then he suddenly stops loving you, you can do so many things that... ...you won't realize that will hurt you both. Because you don't see... ...that you're hurting the people around you. I'm so sorry. I guess I've gone too far this time. I'll fix this, I promise. I'm so sorry, Macey. I'm sorry. "If people are trying to bring you down, it only means that you are above them." The latest saga of the gay husband open letter... ...that went viral in social media. Sis, I already know that. One showbiz police leaked a picture. Here. My God. That person looks yummy. It looks big, sis. It really is, sis. And it gets juicier because according to sources, it happened in Taiwan where their husbands got married. And up to know, they're still there. My God. Did you know that a lot of people are sympathizing with the doctor? People are mad with their husbands. And also, there's an anti-gay group that threatened to protest at the airport. That's too much, dear. It's 2018. There are still a lot of homophobics. Get out. Come on, let's go. What are we waiting for? Why are we not leaving? How can we leave? They're blocking the way. Weirdo. What's his problem? Felix. Felix. What happened? I don't know. All I know is that someone attacked them and hit the car. What? - Cindy. - I don't know the whole detail. Cindy. Cindy, thank God you're here. I cannot contact your Dad. I'm sure that he's with her mistress. I asked the information desk, they don't seem to know where Felix is. Are you listening? Sorry. Mom... ...were you in an accident? What happened to your lips? What are you talking about? Please stay focused. I can't even find my son. Have you checked the emergency room, ma'am? Oh, yes. Who are you again? I'm Lianne. The wife of your son's husband. My baby. - Macey. - Mommy. My baby. - Oh, my God. - Baby. What happened, my baby? Let's talk. Gary. Gary, I'm so sorry. Why are you sorry? This is what you wanted, right? What, you think that I did this because I cannot accept who you are? No. It's not that. You fooled me. Both of you fooled me and Cindy. You didn't even give us the chance to process everything before you left us. You just left. And went on with your lives like you do not have wives. Sure, you're hurt and having a hard time with what you're going through, but what about us? What about us? Have you ever thought what Cindy and I have been through? I was fighting for my love. Because you're my inspiration. You and Macey are my life. If you told me that you're no longer happy... ...and you let me understand your true identity, it probably won't hurt this much. It will hurt... ...but there's no anger. I will try to understand you because that's how much I love you. You understand me? Then I'll let you understand... ...that whatever love I have for you... ...forget it. Leave. All of you, leave. Let them be. Am I included? My baby. Come, Mom. 1574 01:32:28.644 --> 01:32:30.545 Get well soon, baby. 1575 01:32:32.957 --> 01:32:33.858 Let's go. 1576 01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:45.950 What I did, was it that bad? 1577 01:32:47.975 --> 01:32:49.409 It's not just you. 1578 01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.881 I was in it. 1579 01:32:53.432 --> 01:32:54.599 But why is that... ...we need to understand them, despite of us getting hurt? You have the right to get mad at them. They also had the right to get mad at you. If we're to count all the sins, all the mistakes we did to each other, we won't be able to understand one another. We have to make a decision. To forgive. Dad. I'll do it. Dad. You know that I love you, right? You and Uncle Felix. Of course, Macey. I don't want you to get mad on what I'm about to say. I was with Mommy when you left us. I saw her suffer. Daddy, you will always have my love and support. But you hurt Mom. And she has all the right to be angry. And even though she's mad at you... ...deep down, I know... ...that she still loves you so much. So don't be mad at her, please? Thank you, Lianne. I thought my lips will never go back to what it was. Well, next time you want to have a procedure, call me. At least we'll take care of you. Of course. I'll even bring my friends. Thank you. I have to go now. You girls have an appointment. No, we don't. I made sure that you're my only client today. I'm free. Mom, are you in a hurry? Do you want to have dinner? - Come on, let's have dinner, Lianne. - Yeah, let's go. - Right? - Yes. No, I had to make sure that you have an appointment. What? Just in time. You guys better talk. Bye. Lianne. I'm sorry. I didn't mean all the things I've said. I was just swayed by my anger. I love you. You know that. It may not be the same love that I have for Felix. But you know... ...that you will always have a special place in my heart. My love and respect for you will never vanish. And we hope that you'll forgive us. We know we were selfish. We were scared. Because we know... ...that you'll get mad. You'll get hurt. We've seen it with our friends. How they were rejected and turned back by the people that they love. Well... ...there's nothing to be afraid of, Gary. I already accepted you. There's no other choice. But I'll be okay. You deserve to be happy. And Macey wants you to be happy as well, so... I just hope you know how much we love you. Have you... ...accepted me as well? I have to. That's the only way I can set myself free. Slowly I'm helping myself to forgive you both. Because, you know what? I understand why you did all of it. But it does hurt. People say... ..."pain comes with time..." "...but time..." "...will heal the pain." You were able to say it. - It's beautiful. - It's different. - You're moving on. - I'm about to. That was fast. Oh, that looks pretty. I'm gonna wish now... - ...or the chocolate will melt. - Make a wish. There you go. Happy birthday. Thank you. Finally. Finally. We've been waiting for you. Gillian forgot her gift for Lianne. So we went back to the house. So she has a gift for you. Here. This was made-to-order. Made-to-order? What is this? Where will I use this? Try wearing it during Sunday mass. Give it back to me, I'll use it. I guess you don't like it. That won't fit you. Your implants are too big, right, Martina? You should be careful because your stitches are still fresh. Really? Those are real? Damn those boobs. They're a menace to women. - Cheers. - Cheers. Are you having regrets? With what? That I loved Gary? Of course not. You're too sentimental. What I'm asking is if you have any regrets... ...because you got your breast to it's normal size. Don't you miss Gingging and Ningning? No, I really don't. I'm happy with Mara and Clara. You know, that's right. We shouldn't change ourselves for anyone. Too much. - Cheers. - Cheers. But you know, come to think of it... ...I may have lost a husband... ...but I gained a sister in you. Oh, shit. Let's drink to that. - Cheers. - Cheers. So there you are. Guys, it's party time. My goodness. Clothes are not an option. My goodness. What the... I just said that I'm happy with these two. Party. Let's go. Party. There you go.
