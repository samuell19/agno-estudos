I can't believe this. What about bail? I can't believe this. What about bail? Well if you're charged it'll be set pretty high. Do you have any relatives we could call? My my my, ah ha! What do we have here? A boy wonder, graduated MIT at the age of 15, is that right? 14. I got my masters at 17. Mm, you're a real smart guy, aren't you? Know these people? Yeah, the first one's not too clear, she's all shredded up. Tag on her toe says Leslie Piper. Oh, Carlton Baker, your boss. The phone systems say you were the last person to speak to him, before they found him. Considering my client has not been charged with anything, I would suggest that we... Uh, just a minute, counselor. Just a minute. Rick, you did say that you were into robotics, didn't you? Yeah. What is exactly that Omega Systems is developing? Uh, research and development. Come on, Rick, you're commissioned by Omega! You and the kid at the hotel! So? So you're trying to tell me that all these deaths are accidental? You must think we're all idiots here or something. Alright, I have something I want to show you both. This film is from the camera of Biotech Technology. If you watch closely, you will see Dr. Leslie Piper. OK, that's about it. On next turnaround, the view is obscured because of an overturned desk, but uh... you and I know how it turns out in the end, don't we, Rick? Huh? As I said before, detective, since my client has not been charged, I'd appreciate it if we could... Hold your horses, counselor, you just hold your horses. Take a look at that picture, Rick. Look at it, you notice anything strange? She looks... Panicked, yeah. She's about to die. Anything else? She uh... Come on, huh? Like how we can't see the assailant? For one? And for two, how she is constantly looking down at that floor. Like I told you, the creatures are small. 15 to 18 inches. You want small? We found this in his hotel. And that sure ain't no GI Joe. Kind of a queer doll for a grown boy to have, wouldn't you say, counselor? Until we examined it, and we found a mechanical system inside. Sort of like a robot, wouldn't you say, kid? I'm fucked, aren't I? Ricky Meyers, you are under arrest for the murder of Cameron Phillips, and as an accessory to both the murders of Dr. Leslie Piper and Dr. Carlton Baker. You have the right to remain silent, and anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. I really didn't know how to explain what had happened to me. All I knew was that my life was never going to be the same again. I'd been a caretaker at the. Bodega Bay Inn for the off season. Just me and my experiments. I was researching artificial intelligence, trying to make my model robots function autonomously. I was working for Biotech, a major scientific-industrial concern with Dr. Baker and Dr. Piper. But some power was unleashed. Some awesome power that was beyond our control... And after killing Baker and Piper... It came after me. So you two know each other? Oh you bet we do, we go all the way back to the institute. A coworker of mine decided to visit. Interrupting a planned weekend with my girlfriend. He brought along another girl. A psychic who right away suspected something was wrong. This is terrific. Was she ever right. OK, mind if I sprint through your program here, Ricardo? I'd rather you didn't. Come on, it's not like I'm going to steal anything. Through her channeling, I found a trunk in a room I'd never gone in. Look at those. A trunk full of puppets. Life-like puppets that had been built by Andre Toulon. He'd escaped Nazi Germany and come here. And his spirit was very present. He'd been working on the very equations and theories that I was working on. He was afraid of what to do with that power. We found vials of substance that, when injected into the puppets, gave them life. By all accounts, real life, and independent thought. This is so stimulation. It was amazing. Somebody pinch me. Get it off me, man! Oh no... But the evil that was tracking Dr. Baker and Dr. Piper caught up with us. We unleashed creatures from the underworld that were after the same secret we were. It was a nightmare that I didn't believe at first. Guys we got to get out of here! But as the night wore on, I couldn't escape the truth. We banded together and fought. The puppets attacked the creatures instinctively. And the spirit of Toulon guided us through the battle, giving us courage, and showing us the way to defeat the beasts. Get off her, you little bastard! Ow! Die! Yes! We animated Toulon's unfinished puppet, Decapitron, to defeat the strongest creature. No! I think Toulon and I knew the job wasn't finished. I am with you, the power of the magic has been set free. It now needs a wise master to channel and control it. To keep it from evil. I am with you, Puppet Master. And I knew the worst was yet to come. Hello? Susie? Rick, hi, what's happening? Omega came through with the bail. Can you come pick me up? Oh good, yeah of course, when? I don't know, about an hour? I got to go through processing, and talk to one of the administrators or something. It shouldn't take me longer than an hour. I doubt if I'll be able stay awake any longer. OK, I'll see you soon! You know where I'll be! Thank you, I've been here... Great! How are you, I'm Dr. Lawrence Jennings, I'm sorry for the delay, I came as soon as I heard. Oh, no, thank you, I appreciate it. Please, take a seat. My god, aren't these things disgusting... God, you look exhausted! Well I won't keep you long, I realize you want to get home as soon as possible. Well, they closed off the hotel, so... I'll be staying with my girlfriend. Now obviously you heard about Dr. Baker. Yeah. Omega has appointed me Director of Operations. Pending the board's final decision next month, of course. Of course, yeah, I read your articles. Dr. Baker briefed me on your progress. So, you think I'm crazy, don't you? I really have no idea what to make of your statement. It is outlandish. However I haven't been able to establish any motive behind the conspiracy theory. So that's why I'm here, to ask you personally. What happened the other night? Please file over to my office right away, and then when you're finished with that... So, the realization of Omega threatens this, uh, this ancient magic... Exactly! That's why they're targeting the heads. Baker, Piper, myself, probably you... That's why they're targeting the heads. Baker, Piper, myself, probably you... And who are these people? I'm not sure. Then how do you know all this? You do see my problem, don't you? You are asking an awful lot of me. Little monsters, an agency or cult protecting some ancient magic? You must admit it is really, rather fantastic. I agree. Yes. Well look, I haven't come here to debate the plausibility of your story. I bailed you out because I happen to thin you're innocent. So. What is it that you're not telling me? I mean this guy, he's going full speed, and you know it's high pursuit, also right in the middle of nowhere he just stops! Excuse me? Hi, I'm looking for Rick Myers. Could you wait over there? Alright, so how old are these puppets then? Oh well, um... Toulon died shortly after the war. So that's got to make them at least 50 years old, maybe more. 50 years old and the parameters are self-generating? Oh please, come on. I mean how can this be? Well, the mechanics are actually quite basic. From what I can establish, the fuel is the catalyst. And you say there are seven of these puppets still at the hotel? Uh, no, six. The police have one here. As evidence. They think I programmed it to kill Dr. Piper and Dr. Baker. Mr. Myer, there's someone outside that says she's here to take you home. Thank you, tell her I'll be there in a second. Uh, Dr. Jennings, I hope you don't mind. I haven't slept in a couple days. Oh, really, sure, of course. Go on home. Talk to you tomorrow. OK. Hi! You look terrible. I've felt better. I just want to sleep. There'll be time for that later... Come on. Come on. Sweet dreams. Those in the up world, remain in danger. My watchers have been destroyed, but Toulon has not yet escaped. His secret will be revealed to me, and I will have it in my powers. His secret will be revealed to me, and I will have it in my powers. My special child, my ultimate creation, will be awakened from his slumber. Awake, my child. Yes, that's right, mmhmm. Biotech! I hope you both realize that I can't alter or establish any new agenda for Omega. I may be replaced as Director of Operations next month! All I'm saying is that my power is really terribly limited. Well our only concern, Doctor, is that the choices you do make as acting director, are both profitable for Omega, and of course yourself. I assume Dr. Jennings we are secure in here, right? Uh, oh absolutely, yeah. Um, you do understand don't you that all funding from the Pentagon has been rejected on the grounds that Omega is not to be used for military purposes. Now, uh, I don't quite sure how you gentlemen expect me to get around such a restrictive precedent. The Pentagon has no interest in interfering with. Omega's future applications, however our sources tell us that you're very close in realizing the project. And we though perhaps your mainframe database and current prototype might somehow, shall we say, be available? For which, Dr. Jennings, we would be gladly willing to make a sizable donation to the project. To be allocated Dr. Jennings, of course, by you, the Director of Operations. As you see fit. You do understand our position, buddy boy? Oh, absolutely. Yes, and I appreciate your interest, gentlemen. And I'm sure your contribution can be made use of. Somewhere. We appreciate you giving us a call, Doctor. It's comforting to know that there's still businessmen like yourself, open to assistance. We'll be expecting to hear from you. Oh, you can count on it. Thank you, Dr. Jennings. I think he's had it up a nostril. What do you think? Don't touch me. Ah yes, this is Dr. Jennings, get me the Phoenix division, would you, Tom Henry. Thank you. Tom, Lawrence Jennings. Listen, how busy are you at the moment? I've just got a little proposition for you. Oh it's quite painless, and very profitable. Greetings, Puppet Master. Susie! Suz? Shit! Hey. How'd you get here? Dumb question. The others? Are they still in the hotel? They are. All right. OK. We got to get them. All right? You and me. Something's not right. Hey there, it's me, Susie. I told you I'd be back to visit. The nurse tells me you've been coming in and out today. It's good. Tom, thanks for being here at such short notice. No problem, glad I could help you out. Jason. Jason. This is Scott. Scott. Hey. Mr. Henry has assured me you gentlemen are trustworthy, I trust his recommendation. Now the only thing illegal about tonight's work, is we're going to have to do a little bit of trespassing, nothing serious, I assume that's not a big problem! No prob. Easy money. Oh yes, yeah. Very easy indeed. Oh lord of darkness. Master of the underworld. Prepare to rise, my child. Breathe, my child, and live to kill, my child. Your life will be my life. My blood will be your blood. Your power will be my power! We will share the same thoughts, the same rage. What Sutekh hath created, let no man cut asunder. Drink deep, my child, drink deep. OK. Now once we're inside, what we're looking for are six string-less puppets. It shouldn't take us more than about an hour. On second thoughts, maybe two. Now come on, what are you waiting for? Go ahead, smash it, don't cut yourself. We'd better find Myers' room, start from there. Hey, you want to get paid or what? Let's go. This must be it, Tom. I ain't real here, chief. What is it we're looking for, exactly? Like I said, they are string-less, they're between 30 and 40 centimeters high, and they all have internal hydraulic mechanism. Hmm, mechanisms. What? Hmm. Just pick up anything that looks like a puppet, OK? God. Come on, get it open. Ow, OK. There we ago. Re-adjust. OK, you good? OK. All right, I'm sorry buddy, I just don't want that cabby to see you. Ow! Don't stick me! Little puppets in here? Come on out, put your hands up. Hey boss, what do you got over there? Is that one of them? No, I don't think so, it's too crude. You know it's possible they may have been moved during the investigation. Yeah, we're going to have to widen the search. Scott, you check out the basement, see if there's any sign of them there. Jason, you start on the second floor. Right. Anybody see anything, you come and get me immediately, OK? I'll keep searching up here. You got it, boss. Prepare to take my power. To become me. You are growing alive. I am growing inside you. Receive the power. Drink in my evil. Become me! Is that you, Scott? Jason? Hey, knock it off guys, come on! All right, it's obvious that you don't know who you messing with! You goin' get it now. You goin' get it now! Come on, I see you, I got you! Hey, any luck? Nah. Kid probably is crazy. Hey what happened with the game last night? I don't know man, I fucking hate baseball. Hey! Hey you guys! I think I got one! Come here, god damn it! We should go. Oh I got one here! I bet he ain't found shit. Hey, I got one, hey guys! I think I got something! Wait, you little bastard... Shit! Jason! Over here! Where? Over here! Look. Something was following me, so I chased it around the corner, and then it disappeared into the vent! Fast little bastards. Looks like they're still active. They're probably travelling through the vents. We should each take a floor. You think those things are dangerous? Dangerous? Oh please, don't be ridiculous. Maybe. OK Jason you take the fourth floor, I'll take the third. Scott you should check out the dining area, and Tom... Well maybe you should just stay here. Hey at least we know they're still in the hotel, OK? Now come on, go. Why do I have to stay here? No seriously, I mean why is it always me? Lauren? Lauren? No! Nurse! Somebody! Lauren, Lauren, it's me, Susie! Lauren, Lauren! Take it easy, miss! It's all right! It's all right! It's all right! It's all right! Be still. It's all right! Be still. Come on, Rick. Come on. Where did you go? All right. Let's go find your friends, Blade. But be quiet. Hey guys! Guys! Guys? Where the hell are you guys? Ow! OK you. All right, you go find them. You are now ready to receive the final power. To accept the ultimate evil from our lord. Take the power. Take the very life force from me. The very essence of evil. The fountain of rage. Drink deep from the fountain of evil, my child! Drink it in. And let it flow through your body. You will now have the power to travel through the portal, and go to the up world. You will now have the power to travel through the portal, and go to the up world. To destroy those who have the secret. and go to the up world. To destroy those who have the secret. You and I are twins of evil. Go forth and destroy! What's going on? What's going on... Help me? OK. What a night. Come on, come to papa. Get out of here, you little bastards. Come on. Come to papa. No, take it off, please! No! Get off, get it off me! You fucker! Get off! Help me? What? Life force, Rick? Life Force Rick? Rick? Life force, Rick... What? Life force? What? What, wait... Wait wait wait, what's happening? I've got company. You find anything? No, not so far. You know Myers said something about an unstable electrical current affecting their mechanism. Who knows, maybe the storm shut them down. Look, uh, you go find the others, I'm going to make another sweep of the upper floors. See if something's turned up, OK? You got it. Come out, come out wherever you are! Come on now. Son of a bitch... Stay right where you at there, boy. Yeah. So you what all the fuss is about, huh? Somebody been feeding you steroids there, boy? You sure are an ugly piece of shit. Ah god! Cracked my jaw, you little bastard! You better run! Life force... life force... you must kill the beast. There is a fault where you are. Evil. Kill the beast. You must kill the beast! There you are, where are the others? What? OK. Who else is here. Four of them? Well, OK. Let's find the others and get the hell out of here. Now what? Oh where are you, you little buggers? Hello, hello? Oh, well well, what do we have here? Something heavy has been dragged in. What? Tom? All right you little asshole, I know you're in here! I know you's hiding. Yes, that's pretty damn funny, you hitting me like that in the jaw. And I was laughing my ass off there. Yeah, you stay right there boy, I won't hurt you. Now take you to live with this nice family out in the country. Yeah you going to like it. Yeah, you're going to have all kinds of fun! You tough guy, huh? You tough, boy? Tough guy? Yeah we'll see how tough you are with a hunk of lumber up your butt. Pucker up. Woo! Kiss your achey, breaky ass buh-bye. Uh! Come on, guys, are we on the same team or what? We're on the same team guys, remember that. Jason? Scott? Where are you guys? Hey, cut the crap, answer me! Wow, wait a minute! Yes! Wow, yes! Oh you are beautiful... Wow, yes! Oh you are beautiful... You're a work of art! Oh you are beautiful... You're a work of art! What do they call you, little... Shit! I didn't do anything! Leave me alone! No! Tom? Rick? Rick! Hey, little guy. Where's Rick? You stay here, OK? Tom? Tom? Shit! Oh shit! Oh... Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh! Oh shit! Guys! Where's Pinhead and Jester? OK, we got to find them. Blade, take Tunneler, and you work your way to the attic! Six Shooter, Torch, go downstairs and meet in the lobby! Rick? Jester? Pinhead!? Oh!? Oh my god! Susie! Oh my god! Rick!? Jeeze! Dr. Jennings? Rick we got to get out, there's something deadly in here! Where's Susie? Hold on, I'm coming to get you! What did you do with the puppets? Fuck the puppets, are you out of your mind? A man has just been killed! Whatever killed him is after the puppets! Susie? What are you doing here? Lauren became hysterical earlier and told me you were in trouble! I tried calling you! OK. We got to find the puppets and then get out of here. What's going on? God damn it! What's happening!? Now what do you want? Those things aren't back, are they? Come on! What is it? The formula! Use the formula Rick! Help me kill beast? Force is Rick!? What does this mean? Kill the beast! Oh my god! Oh, you're incredible! You are incredible, and worth staying for! Definitely worth staying for! Is this Toulon? Help me? Who are you? Lauren? You must destroy the demon! The avatar from hell! Rick? Come on, get the puppets together, we're getting out of here! No! What do you mean, no? We can't. What do you mean, no? We can't. You don't understand. I can't leave, it's just going to keep on coming back here! Jennings, take Susie and get the hell out of here! What about Lauren? I don't know! Jester! Where's Decapitron? Decapa who? Where is it? They hid him. Gimme that, gimme. OK little guy, get comfortable. We've been through this before. OK, what I need... Susie, hook up those wires to the circuit! God! OK. Rick, can we just take this one and go, please? That won't do anything. We have their magic! They're going to keep coming until they get it back, or until they're stopped. Now, are you going to help me or not? Yeah, forgive me Rick, but I would really rather not stick around here and wait for that thing to find us. Call me nervous, but I've lost one man already, I don't even know where the other two are! Look, I need your help! You're a scientist, for Christ's sake. Come on! Aren't you curious? What's it going to be? What do you want me to do? Alright so the main fuse panel is over there. It's hooked up to the generator, we'll need a steady current. Their fuel acts as a conduit for raw electricity, allowing autonomous parameters. Basically, life. Jennings, get over by the fuse panel. The fuck happened? Oh... Dr. Jennings? Jason? If the fuel lines are up, we should be OK. Now, up on one! Just like old times. Is this right? OK, up on two! No, no, up on two! No, we haven't got it yet, turn it over! They're on Rick, they're on! Nothing's happening! Turn it over! Like I said, they're all on, nothing! OK, we got it! Ready? Oh my god. Come on, come on. This is Omega. There it is! Hey! Where the hell are you guys? Jason? Tom? Woo! This is just... My god Sutekh has come to reclaim his magic. You are in great danger, leave this place. The puppets and I will see that the Dark Pharaoh is destroyed. Go, whilst is time. Oh! OK, we're out of here! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! We can't leave them... What are you talking about? I am talking about the future of robotics! The realization of Omega! You cannot leave those puppets, Rick, who knows what's going to happen to them? Those puppets can take care of themselves! For Christ's sake, all we want is one! If you take just one of those puppets, just one of them, that thing will eventually hunt you down! This is the second time this has happened in less than a week. I'm not pressing my luck. Dr. Jennings? Hey this ain't funny anymore! Guys, where are you all? Heraldo wouldn't even believe this story. Hey, wait for me! You were right about those puppets, Rick, we'll leave the bloody things! Jason? Motherfucker... Get away from me you motherfucker! What are you doing!? Go, Susie! Rick! Rick, no! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Wow. Uh, hi guys. You going down? Oh shit... Three lives have been lost tonight, to your senseless greed. Well I mean this is ridiculous, you're just puppets, for Christ's sake! Hey, no, no, no, come on! Please, no. No! Wait a minute, come on now! Rick, are you all right? Let's go! Hey hey, come on, please! Let's go! Hey hey, come on, please! Guys, come on, I never did anything to you! Don't do this to me, come on now! Oh no, no no no, oh please! No! Rick, come on, wake up, let's go! Rick, come on! Rick, wake up! Sutekh exists in our world now. His powers will be hard to overcome. Sutekh is after the Puppet Master, we have no time. Damn you! No! Rick! No! Rick! Rick! You should not have entered through the portal, Sutekh. Your powers have diminished. You have made yourself vulnerable. I will always have the power to destroy you! You and your coven can no longer control the power. The magic has changed over. You are no match for me! But the magic is! Come on! Run, Susie! Sutekh, you will be destroyed. You will not defeat me! Oh! You have mastered well the secrets of the ancients. And my powers here are spent, but for one, behold! Even you cannot prevent my escape! For once I summon the portal to my world, no power can prevent my returning! Escape from this dimension cannot be permitted, Sutekh. Nor can it be prevented! Sorry. Your reservation's just been canceled. Shit. Hey! Time? Oh, uh, hour and 22. How many miles? 15, even better than yesterday! Hm! So, how are all my boys this morning? Well, those guys are OK, as you can see, but Decapitron needs a little work. I'm going to take a shower. OK. And no peaking, pinhead! All things have their time, and mine has passed. The future is yours, Rick, as well as the magic. Guard and protect it and keep it from evil. I am with you, Puppet Master. I know that the spirit of Toulon will always be with me. But I also know there will be more evil to fight. At least I'll have a few friends to go into battle with me.
