Deploy yourselves! Scour the nearby riverbanks. Search throughout the tower ruins. Tear the veil from this shameful mystery! Honour demands it! Honour commands it! The dreadful truth must be revealed, burning like a flame amidst the baleful clouds... You seem perturbed. - I have good reason. As you know, my fortunes have been sadly on the wane, while Edgardo, the mortal enemy of me and my family, from his crumbling castle scornfully raises his head and mocks me! There is only one man who could help me regain control of things, and Lucia has dared to reject his hand. Oh! No sister of mine she is! Inconsolable girl. Weeping still at her mother's resting place, how can she think of marriage? Let us respect a heart cleft with sorrow and afraid to love. Afraid to love? Lucia is aflame with love. What are you saying? - Hear me! Recently she was wandering yonder in the park in that solitary lane where her mother lies buried when suddenly a maddened bull bore down upon her. A shot rang out in the echoing air ...and the beast sank to the ground. And who fired the shot? A man who did not give his name. Perhaps Lucia... - Fell in love with him. So she saw him again? Each morning. Where? - In that lane Damnation! Have you unmasked her suitor yet? I only have a suspicion. Ah, tell me! He is your enemy. The one you hate the most. Could it be - Edgardo? The very one you named. What vicious, fatal rage you have roused within me! Too foul, too foul by far would that dreadful suspicion be! It freezes and shakes my core. The hair bristles on my brow... So shameful is she who was born my sister! Cherishing your honour I had to be cruel to you. Ah, rather than see you guilty of so perfidious a love, I would rather, sister, that a thunderbolt had struck you down! Her death I could bear better than this! Your suspicion now becomes a certainty! Do you hear? Tell me. Oh, unhappy day! Overcome by fatigue during our prolonged search, ...we rested in the hall of that ruined tower. Then we beheld in silence the figure of a man appear. So closely did he pass that I recognised him. Then he cunningly slipped away and vanished from our sight. His name, however, was told us by a falconer. And who was it? - Edgardo. So it is he! Oh, the rage that burns within consumes my very heart. Ah, no, do not believe it, I cannot endure it. - Please stop. Hear me! No, I cannot! You plead in vain for pity toward her Words of vengeance are all I shall listen to. Treacherous pair! My violent wrath will now descend upon you! The evil flame that consumes you I shall extinguish with blood... He is not here yet! This is madness! What have you brought me to? Daring to come here with your brother about. True. But Edgardo must be warned of the peril surrounding us. Why do you look about so fearfully? That fountain! Ah, I can never look at it without a shiver. For there, you know, a Ravenswood, maddened with jealousy, stabbed his beloved. The luckless one fell into the water ...and she haunts it still. I have seen her ghost... What are you saying? Listen. At dead of night, when all was still, ...a pallid ray of moonlight fell upon the fountain... when a low moan was heard on the breeze, and there, at the water's edge, ...the spectre appeared to me...Ah! I saw her lips moving as if she were speaking, And with a languid hand she beckoned me to her. for a moment she stood motionless, then suddenly vanished... and the waters, so clear before, reddened as with blood. My God, the omen's meaning is too painfully clear! Ah, Lucia, Lucia, abandon this terrifying love. He is the very light of all my days ...the comfort and the solace of my pain. When rapt in ecstasy, in burning ardour, with the language of the heart, he swears eternal love, I then forget my sorrows, my anguish turns to joy. And when I am beside him, heaven opens for me... Ah, days of bitter weeping ...are in store for you, yes, yes, Ah, Lucia, give him up. When rapt in ecstasy, in burning ardour... He approaches. I shall stand nearby and keep watch. Forgive me, Lucia, for summoning you at this unusual hour. it is for a very important reason. An urgent reason drove me, for at the first rays of dawn I must be far beyond Scotland's borders. What do you mean? - To France's friendly shores I must set sail to negotiate the future of our country. And thus will leave me here to weep? Before I leave I shall see Ashton to offer him the hand of peace and ask to be granted yours as a seal of our friendship. What are you saying? Ah, no! For the present our secret love must remain in silence buried. I understand! That grim persecutor of my clan is not content with my misfortunes! He robbed me of my father, my ancestral heritage. Was that not enough? What more does the villain want? My utter ruin? My blood? How he hates me!... Oh heaven, calm his mad fury. A burning anger rises in my heart! Listen to me. Edgardo! Hear what I say and tremble. In my rage I swore upon my father's tomb an oath of eternal vengeance against your family. But then I saw you and in my heart affection unseated anger, but that did not invalidate my vow. It could still be fulfilled! Be calm, restrain yourself, I beg you A careless syllable can betray us! Have I not grieved enough? Would you have me die of anguish? Give up all other thoughts, save love alone. The holiest, most noble of all vows is that of true love. My vow still binds... Save love from your heart Yield, yield to me, yield to love Swear before heaven that you will be eternally faithful as my wife. God can hear us, God can see us. A loving heart is both church and altar. to your destiny I link mine... I am your betrothed. And I yours. Ah, only icy death can quench our passion. I call on love as witness to my vow. Now the time has come to part. Oh, how I dread those words! My heart goes with you. My heart remains here with you.. Now the time has come to part. Ah, if sometimes you think of me and send me a letter, fresh hopes will fortify my fleeting life. I shall always cherish vivid memories of you, dearest. Ah!...On the breeze will come to you my ardent sighs, you will hear in the murmuring sea the echo of my laments. When you think of me living on tears and grief, then shed a tear on this token of our love.. I must go! Farewell! Remember, Heaven has joined us! Farewell! Lucia will come to you soon. I await her anxiously. Our noble relatives have all arrived to celebrate this most illustrious match. Arturo will soon be here. And if she stubbornly dares to refuse? Fear not: Edgardo's long absence, the letters we intercepted, the false word we spread of his new infatuation, all will cure Lucia of her blind obsession. Here she comes! Hand me the forged letter! Make haste to the highway leading to Scotland's royal city and conduct Arturo to this castle midst cheers and applause. Come nearer, Lucia. I hoped to see you happier today, on this day when Hymen's wedding torches burn in your honour. You stare at me in silence? If I appear pale and unhappy and other than myself, I cover the grief and anguish that you have caused me. Perhaps God will forgive you for your cruel, inhuman conduct and for my grief... The demands of reason make me merciless towards your unworthy infatuation, but if that is now past, I am still your brother. My anger is at an end, ...if you are done with your insane amour..., A noble husband... Stop, I beg you! What is it? I am sworn to another. It cannot be! - Enrico!... I forbid it! - I am pledged to another man. Enough. This paper will quickly show you what kind of cruel wretch you think you love! Read it. My heart is pounding! You are trembling... Oh, misery! Alas, a fatal bolt from the blue! I suffered in tears, languished in sorrow. my hopes, my life, I pledged to one heart, the moment of death is upon me! He gave his faithless heart to another! Madness drove you to this vile affair, to love that villain you betrayed your family. But heaven gave you just reward: The moment of death is upon me. - Madness drove you... Alas! The terrible moment has come for me, yes, The moment of death is upon me. - Madness drove you... to love that villain you betrayed your family. What is that? - Do you not hear the joyous music? What can it be? - Your bridegroom has arrived. A shudder courses through my veins! You marriage hour is near! My death is near! This is the great moment! - A veil is over my eyes. Listen to me: William is dead! Mary will ascend the throne. Prostrate in the dust is the party I supported. Ah, I tremble! Arturo alone can rescue me from this brink of utter destruction. And what of me? - You must save me! Enrico! Let us go to your bridegroom. But I am sworn to another! - You must save me! But... You must! If you betray me now, my fate is sealed for ever... You deprive me of honour and life. Ready the executioner's axe for me. In your dreams you will see me, an angry, menacing spectre! That bloody axe you will always see before your eyes, You who see my my weeping,, you who read my heart, if my grief be not ignored in heaven, as it is on earth, take from me, eternal God, this hopeless life of mine, So wretched am I that death would be a welcome joy... Well? Your last ray of hope has waned! I believed, on your suspicions,that your brother meant to close all ways so that no news of you reached French soil and the man you swore to love. I myself had a letter written by you conveyed to him by reliable hand. In vain! Still he remains silent. That silence speaks clearly enough of his unfaithfulness! What shall I do? - Resign yourself to fate. And my oath? - Your are deluding yourself! Nuptial vows not blessed by a minister of God neither heaven nor earth will recognise. My mind yields to your arguments, but my heart is deaf to reason and resists. You must overcome it. Oh, ill-fated love... Yield, or more misfortunes lie in wait for you, wretched girl! By my tender care, by your dead mother, let a brother's peril move you and sway your heart, or your mother in her grave will shudder with horror because of you. Yield, yield! May a brother's peril move you and sway your heart. Be silent! - No, no! Yield! You have won! I am not so unnatural. Oh, what joy you give me! Oh, what a cloud you have dispelled! What joy! For the wellbeing of your friends you offer yourself as a victim. And such a great sacrifice will be inscribed in heaven. Guide me! If the pity of men is not bestowed on you, there is a God who will wipe away your tears... Guide me! You have won! We join in rousing jubilation, because of you, we see reborn the day of hope, here friendship guides you, here love leads you, new life is all around, How like a star in the gloomy night, like a smile in the midst of tears... Soon through the darkest clouds, your star shall rise again. I shall restore you fortunes, brighter and more splendid. Give me your hand, Enrico. Let me embrace you. I come to you as a friend, a brother and protector... But where is Lucia? She will soon be here. But do not wonder if she seems smitten with melancholy, for she is still overcome with grief at the death of her mother. I know, yes, yes, I know. Smitten with melancholy, she grieves for her mother still. But tell me one thing more: I have heard that Edgardo has had the temerity to cast desirous looks upon her. such effrontery! It is true that he rashly dared, but... Here comes Lucia now. Grieving for her mother. Here is your bridegroom. Be careful! Would you destroy me? Dear God! May I offer, and pray you accept, my vows of tender love. Be careful! Let the ceremony be performed now! Dear God! - Come nearer. With pleasure. O Lord, assist this afflicted one! I am led to the sacrifice! Alas! Do not waver! Sign! Sustain, o Lord, this poor girl. Sign! I have signed my death warrant! Now I can breathe again. - I feel cold and feverish. I feel faint. What is that noise? - Who is there? Edgardo! Edgardo! Day of terror! Who tries to bar my way? - Who attempts... Who restrains the hand that leaps to the sword? - ...to restrain my wrath? A cry of pity darts from my chest... - Her downcast eyes, her fear... ...arise in me. - ...are proof of her remorse! How like a withered rose... - She is my sister! ...she lies twixt life and death. - She lies twixt life and death. I am defeated, moved! - Ah, I cannot smother... Faithless or not, I love her still. - ...the remorse in my heart. If only this misery and wretchedness would end my life of suffering. But death will not pity me, I must live on in anguish! The veil has fallen from my eyes. Betrayed by heaven and earth. I want to weep, but cannot. Even my tears have left me comfortless. Begone, wretch! Or your blood will flow! If I die, I shall not die alone! I am a man of God. His power is vested in me. Respect it now! In His name I command you to put down your anger and your blades. Let there be peace. God abhors a murderer, and in holy writ it stands: ''He who lives by the sword "...shall perish by the sword.." Let us have peace! Rash intruder, what brought you to these doors? My destiny and my right. Villain! Lucia is sworn to be mine. Forget that unhappy love, she is now another's. Another's? No... Here, look at this! You tremble... you are shaken! Is this your handwriting? Answer me! Is this your signature? Answer me! Yes! Here's your pledge, faithless heart! Now give me mine. You are forsworn before both heaven and love. I curse the moment that I fell in love with you. I execrate your hateful family! I should have fled from you. Loathed and accursed girl, I should have fled from you! May you be damned forever! This rage is madness! Begone! Begone! I can scarcely restrain myself from slaying you on the spot. But soon a far worse fate will fall on you cursed head. God, save him at this cruel moment, hear the plaint of an unhappy girl I pray to you from the depth of my suffering, for nothing mortal gives me any hope. This prayer I utter with my last breath of life! The night is fearsome, like my fate! Heavens thunder, lightning, rage! Let the natural order be overturned and the world perish! But I am not mistaken! I hear a horse galloping close by. It stops. Whoever could be making his way here through the threats and rage of the storm? It is I. What effrontery! Ashton? Yes. Do you dare to stand before me under this roof? I am here for your misfortune. Mine? Did you not come to my house? Here the unavenged soul of my father still wanders. I feel him shudder. Every breath you draw here spells death to you! The ground here trembles under your feet! You should indeed shudder when you cross this threshold, like a man who descends still living to dwell in his tomb.. Lucia has been led to the altar, and thence to her bridal bed. He further rends my wounded heart! Oh, torture! Oh, jealousy! She is in her marriage bed! - Oh, jealousy! Well? Listen. My house was resounding with joy and celebration, but vengeance spoke louder within my heart! It has brought me here. Through the winds I could still hear its voice, and the rage of the elements answered my rage... What do you want of me? Listen to me. To punish the affront, the avenging sword of my followers hangs over your head. But shall another kill you? Never! You know who it is must slay you! I know that I swore by my father's ashes to tear out your heart. You? - Yes. - You! When? At the first sign of the morning sun Where? - Among the icy tombs of Ravenswood. Yes, I shall come. Prepare to remain there. There I shall kill you. At first light! O sun, make haste to rise, array yourself with a bloody funeral wreath, illuminate the horrible rivalry of a mortal hate, of a blind fury. The sounds of joy and revelry ring out... They echo throughout the realm of Scotland and warn our perfidious enemies By a powerful protector we are happier and more fearsome... Cease this rejoicing! Why so pale? Cease, I tell you! Oh, heaven! What has happened? A ghastly deed! You seem quite horrified! From the room to which Lucia and her husband had retired there came a groan, a cry of someone at the point of death! I rushed into the chamber and what a sight greeted my eyes! Oh, what a terrible calamity! Arturo had fallen to the floor, cold, lifeless and spattered with blood! And Lucia's hand still clasped the murdered man's weapon. She fixed me...with her gaze.. "Where is my husband?" she asked me, Then upon her pale face there dawned a smile! Unhappy girl! She had lost her reason. Oh, what a dreadful deed! What a fearful turn of events. Oh, let the black shades of night enshroud this dire crime. Her blood bespattered hand will call down heaven's vengeance on us all... Here she comes! O my God! As if she left her grave! I hear the sweet sound of his voice! Ah, that voice It pierces my heart! Now I am restored to you, Edgardo! My beloved Edgardo! Yes, I am restored to you! I have escaped from your enemies... An icy chill runs through me! My whole being trembles. My footsteps falter! Yes, let us sit together by the fountain for a while. Alas, that gloomy spectre rises to keep us apart! Alas! Edgardo! Let us take refuge before the altar. It is covered with roses. Do you hear that exquisite music? It is the wedding hymn... This is the ceremony! Oh, how happy I am! Edgardo, Edgardo, how happy I am! My joy is too deep for words.. The incense is burning - the sacred torches are burning all around us! Here is the minister! Give me your hand... Oh, happy day! Yours I am at last and you are mine, mine by gift of heaven. God has given you to me... What a cruel plight! Every joy and pleasure God have mercy on her! I shall share with you. Our life will be one long smile... ...from bountiful heaven... Here is her brother. Is what they tell me really true? All too true. O traitress! You shall be punished for this. Stop! Let her be! O heavens! Can you not see the condition she is in? What are you asking? - How pale she is! What are you asking? - She has lost her reason. - Great God! Cruel man! Tremble, brutal man, for her life. Do not look at me so fiercely. I signed that paper, it is true... In his terrible anger, o God, he tramples on the ring! He is cursing me! I was the victim of a cruel brother. But I have always loved you, Edgardo. And I love you still. For pity's sake, do not go. Whose name did you say? Arturo? Whose? Arturo? Do not run away. For pity's sake! No, do not run away. For pity's sake. What a night of terror! Edgardo, please do not go! Shed your bitter tears over my earthly remains, but meanwhile, in heaven above, I shall pray for you. But not till you come to me there will heaven seem fair to me... Remorse will bring me days of bitter weeping! It is not possible to hold back the tears. Tomb of my forefathers, now receive the last of our unhappy family. This brief and angry struggle shall rage no more. I shall throw myself upon my enemy's blade. My life is a hateful burden. the universe itself is nothing but a desert to me without Lucia! The castle is still alight with the wedding torches! The night is brief indeed for those who celebrate! Graceless woman! While I pine away in hopeless tears, you rejoice and gloat by your happy consort's side! Joy has filled your heart, as death fills mine... Soon a forgotten tomb will give me refuge. There no compassionate tears will ever fall! I shall find no solace even in oblivion. You too, even you, will soon forget my unvalued sepulchre. But never, cruel Lucia, pass near it if your husband is with you. O cruel Lucia, respect the memory of one who dies for you... Ah, wretched girl! A dreadful fate! No hope of help is left! She will not live to see the sunset of this day that dawns. Merciful heaven. Tell me. What is it? Oh poor creature! Tell me. Say for whom are you weeping? Tell me, in pity's name! For Lucia. - Do you say Lucia? Unhappy girl! - Come, tell me! Yes, the poor girl is dying Her wedding was her funeral. Her love has bereft her of her reason. This hour may be her last. She sighs and calls for you.. Ah, Lucia is dying! Lucia, ah! She will not live to see the sunset of this day that dawns. Her love has bereft her of her reason. She sighs and calls for you. My Lucia! She will not live beyond the sunset of this day that dawns.. Her death knell is already being tolled! That sound falls on my heart like lead. My fate is decided. - O God! I must see her again. Stop, come to your senses! - I shall see her, and then... Whither are you rushing, hapless one? She is no longer with us. Lucia! Hapless one! She is no longer here? Then she is.. ..in heaven! Lucia is no more! Poor unfortunate creature! Now you unfold your wings in the sight of God, my beloved soul! Turn your calm smile to me, your faithful love will come to you. Though the wrath of our enemies has made us cruelly at odds, has kept us apart on earth, God will unite us in heaven, beautiful, beloved creature.. I come to you! Madman! What are you doing? I want only to die. Come to your senses! What have you done? O my beloved, I come to you. Wretched man! Turn to me to your faithful love. Pray to heaven. In spite of our enemies' wrath... and our cruel strife... God will unite us both! May God forgive this crime!
