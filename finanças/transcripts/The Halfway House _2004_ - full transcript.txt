So even though there's six of us, nobody wants to go near the guy! So Charlie, he's the first to pull out his taser. He tases the son of a bitch who starts twitching, going. (gags) (laughs) So we're laughing, and this guy's funny as hell, standing there, going. (Gags) (laughs) So then Pete and Danny, they pull out their tasers, too. - Excuse me. - By the time we're done, we've all got the taser lines in him. The guy still don't go down! He just stand there going. (gags) (Dick laughs) (men laugh) I hate to interrupt these fond memories, but can one of you possibly help me? Well, that depends, young lady. Just what kind of help you need? I'm here to report a missing person. - And who are you? - My name is Larissa Morgan. I'm looking for my younger sister. We live together. How long has your sister been missing? She's been going for nearly three days now. - You two have a fight? - No, nothing like that. She went at jogging two nights ago before dinner and never came back. Her name is Annie. Here's her picture. (dark dramatic music) Nice tits. That's all you can say? A young girl has gone missing, who knows what might've happened to her, and the only thing you can do is making some sexist crack? Please, calm down, miss. The Inspector is only trying to- - I know what he was trying to say, and I do not appreciate it! You all stick up for each other, don't you? Now, what exactly are you going to do about finding my sister? (sighs) So where your sister allegedly go missing? (sighs) She left our apartment in Lincoln Heights. At approximately 6:00 PM on Tuesday. That's the last I've seen of her. Well, I want you to be sure and include all that when you fill out these forms, and leave 'em with the desk sergeant. (door shuts) Nice ass. Inspector, do you think this could be related to the others? (dramatic music) (door shuts) Miss Morgan, wait up. What's wrong? Did I forgot my e-mail address? No. Look, I just want to apologize for the way inspector treated you in there. Sometimes he can be a real- - Rude, insensitive asshole? (laughs) Yeah. I guess you could say that. Unfortunately, he also happens to be my boss. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but I have problems of my own, or weren't you paying attention? I was. I mean, see, that's what I want to talk to you about. You see, there's been other disappearances in your area. [Larissa] Disappearances? (dark brooding music) All the other girls were residents there, the Mary Magdalene Halfway House for Troubled Girls. Every month or so, they report another one missing. Couldn't they just have run away? I mean, the place doesn't exactly look like Club Med. Well, that's what the inspector thinks, and that's why there hasn't been anything in the media about it. But you think something different? I didn't till I heard about your sister, Miss Morgan. Call me Larissa, and you are? Sergeant Sheen, Dick Sheen. And I suppose you like to keep your weapon nice and clean. I beg your pardon? (laughs) Skip it. Why don't I just go in and find out what they know? Hold on. You just can't walk over there and start asking questions. [Larissa] And why not? Well, the people who run that place aren't just going to volunteer information to somebody who comes in off the streets. They're a bunch of cloister religious types. - But I'm her sister. - Yeah, and I'm a cop. It's my job to do the investigating. That's not what your boss thinks. Who, him? He's an asshole. (both chuckle) (dark ethereal choral music) (footsteps shuffle) Morning, sister. (door opens) (dramatic ethereal music) Yes. Good afternoon ma'am, sister. I'm Sergeant Sheen, Lincoln Heights Detective Division. Is Father Fogerty in? Yes, but he's hearing the girls' confessions. - That could take hours. - I see. Well, perhaps you could help me out with something, sister- - Sister Cecilia. Have you had any more of your girls run away, disappear? Heavens, no. We would have reported it if they had. And none of the other girls have ever come around again? No, not yet. We're living in constant hope that the poor lost souls will be returned to us. I'm sure you do. By any chance, have you seen this girl? She's not one of ours. I certainly would've remembered her face. - Who is this child? - Her name is Annie, and she's from the area. She's been reported missing, too. Oh, I see. Well, I'll be sure we pray for her safe return, and I'll be happy to show this to Father Fogerty if you like. No. I guess that won't be necessary. After all, if she had come around here, you probably would know. [Cecilia] Yes. There isn't much that gets by me here. (rock music plays faintly over headphones) (tense music) ♪ Give a little bump ♪ Well, good day, sergeant. (door shuts) Well, if they do know anything, they're sure not going to volunteer it. But... There's more, isn't there? Well, you had mentioned in your report that your sister was wearing these yellow and black radio headphones? Yeah. She had them on the last time I saw her. She wore 'em everywhere. Well, there is this guy there, a handyman or janitor or something, real creepy type. And? Well, it might be nothing, but was wearing the same type of headphones. Dick, we've gotta go back. Those have to be hers. (laughs) Wait a minute, not so fast. Don't you see? That is too much of a coincidence. Those people could've done something to Annie. I can't go in there and poke around without a search warrant. Get one. (laughs) Not with this type of evidence. They'd have my badge. Well, what are you gonna do then? I'm gonna talk to the inspector. He'll listen to me. Are you out of your fucking mind? How do you ever expect to get promoted if you keep going off half cocked on these wild ass hunches? You're not being professional. You should know better than to let some hysterical broad lead you around and make a fool out of you! Stop thinking with your dick, Dick! But what about the headphones? Circumstantial bullshit, that's what. You're telling me that young women under protective care of the Mary Magdalene Halfway House are being abducted and possibly harmed in some way and that representatives of the Catholic church are somehow trying to cover it up? Now who in the hell who is gonna believe that? Now get out of my office before I have you suspended for being such a moron! (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (phone rings in distance) (door shuts) I suppose I'm on my own now. I'm really sorry. I feel like I've let you down. At least you tried. It's more than anyone else has done. Yeah, but I just wish there was some way to make it up to you. (slow dramatic music) (both pant and moan) It's nice of you to invite me in. Yeah, I needed company. You must miss your sister an awful lot. She's the only thing I have since our mother died. I mean, my dad's around somewhere, but he's pretty worthless. (both moan and pant) I've just gotta find her, and you've gotta help me. You know I want to, but how? [Larissa] Gotta get inside that place. You can take me in as a girl in trouble. - No way. It's too risky. - It's the only way. Once I'm inside under cover, I'll find out what's going on. [Dick] And what if they find out what you're up to? (Dick grunts) If they're on the level, they'll just kick me out. And if they're not? No, I'm not gonna let you do it. - Oh yes, you are. - Oh no, I'm not. - Dick, please. - No, I'm not. I'm gonna do this with or without your help. So is it a yes. (Dick gasps) Or a no? (Dick grunts) (Larissa laughs) All right. I'll help you do it. Thanks. (dramatic ethereal music) (door opens) - Hello again, sergeant. - What brings you back here? - Official business, sister. - This young lady is in trouble. - [Cecilia] Oh, really? - What kind of trouble? Same old story, I'm afraid. Miles from home, in a strange city, no money, no friends. We picked her up for panhandling outside a bus station. That's not really a crime, but it's only a matter of time before she's into drugs, prostitution, armed robbery. What do you say, sister? Is this a life worth saving? Of course. We'll take good care for little... - Larissa. - Little Larissa. - Step this way. - Thank you, sister. I'll come back in a couple of days and make sure she's okay. Oh, really, that won't be necessary. Everything will be just fine. Lutkus, show the officer out. (dark brooding music) (door creaks closed) And what is your last name, dear? Morgan. Larissa Morgan. Well, Miss Morgan, I'm sure you'll find a better life here than you did in the streets. I'm sure I will. Good, because if you screw up here, you'll wish you were never born. (knock thuds) [Father Fogerty] Yes. - It's Sister Cecilia. - What? - Yes, we have a new guest. - Come in. (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) (clock ticks) - Ah. - Father. Welcome. Jelly bean? No. Well, this halfway house was named after Saint Mary Magdalene, an adulteress who converted by completely dedicating herself to Christ. You can do the same by placing yourself in our hands. Just how do I do that? Trust in faith, my dear, and in return, we will take care of all your needs. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want? Yes, my dear. That's it exactly. This is one place in the world where you can always be safe. Thank you, father. Now report back to Sister Cecilia, and she'll show you around. (footsteps shuffle) Oh, and God be with you, my child. (door shuts) (dramatic organ music) Hmm, hmm. (upbeat music) (muffled chatter) This is the rec room. This is where you'll be spending the most of your time when you will not be in church or in the classroom or doing chores. So, I'll leave you to introduce yourself and make new friends. (muffled whispering) (footsteps shuffle) (muffled laughter) - Who the fuck are you? - Who the fuck wants to know? I just happen to be the number one bitch around here. [Larissa] I can see that. You got a smart mouth. Maybe I should shut it for you. - You and what army? - Me and my homegirls. How would you like us to rearrange your face? Whoa, welcoming the new girl, I see. What's it to you? I just didn't want you start playing rough and have a nasty fall. After all, Angelena, you could slip on this hardwood floor and crack your skull wide open. - Why, you overgrown- - Save it. Have your way for now. Just be careful bending over in the shower. Yeah, why is that? "Cause you never know when a little Dutch boy might come along and shove his fist up a dyke! (girls laugh) (footsteps shuffle) Thanks for stepping in like that, but I probably could've handled it. You look like you might only. Angelena fights dirty, and besides, she's always got Shelby and Sheila with her. What's your name? Larissa. And you are? My friends call me Cherry Pie. I do hope we can be friends. - And this is Edwina. - Eddie. Eddie will do. You know, you'd better watch your ass around here. There may be not be anyone around to save it next time. See you later. (footsteps shuffle) (sighs) (dark brooding music) Make sure you do a thorough job, ladies, and lunch is in a half an hour. And remember, cleanliness is next to godliness. (footsteps shuffle) (Father Fogerty hums) (footsteps shuffle) (door shuts) (broom sweeps) Missed a spot.

(bell rings) (fast tense music) (sex doll squeaks) Are you coming to lunch, Father Fogerty? - Not today, my dear. - Way too much work to do. (doors shut) (door opens) (Father Fogerty cries out) (body thuds) What... (door shuts) (groans) (grunts and sighs) (screams) (dark brooding music) (Cecilia claps) Bed time, ladies! Come on! Everybody up to your room! Let's go. (footsteps shuffle) - Goodnight, Sister Cecilia. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sister. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, sister. Goodnight. Goodnight. Don't forget to say your prayers. (dark brooding music) (buttons beep) (knock thuds) Just a minute. Come in. (door opens) It's me. I just wanted to say goodnight. Goodnight. Don't forget to turn your light out. Sister Cecilia comes around and checks. That's why there's windows on the inside. Not much privacy around here, is there? Not much. Well, goodnight. (door shuts) (light clicks off) (heels clack) (tense string music) (tense brooding music) (door shuts) (buttons beep) - Hello? - It's me. Are you all right? Yeah, I guess you could say that. This place has all the warmth of a concentration camp. I told you this wasn't a good idea. Look, we've already been through this. I've gotta find out what happened to Annie. While we're at it, can you check on this father Fogerty character? Do you suspect him? Well, let's just say that he's twisted enough to vote the Marquis de Sade into sainthood, but that doesn't prove anything. Find out what you can about him and the rest of the staff. Okay. But if things get too strange, just give me a call. I'll come over and get you out. Like a knight in shining armor? - Huh? - Never mind. Oh, and wait for me I call you. According to the Catholic gestapo, I'm not allowed contact with the outside world. - Understand? - Roger that. Goodnight. (button beeps) (up-tempo electronic music) (Cherry Pie pants and moans) Oh, yeah. Oh yes. (Cherry Pie moans) (cries out) (Vaseline squelches) (Eddie grunts and moans) (figurine falls over) (lighter clicks) Well kid, this is it. Again? I thought you were finished. No. I meet tonight's the night we break out of this dump. You're serious. Serious as a heart attack, baby, and you're coming with me. - I don't know about this. - What if we get caught? Isn't it worth the risk to get away from Attila the Nun and that perverted old priest? And that creepy handyman who keeps trying to watch us when we're in the showers? Him, too. That's why we gotta get away. And besides, I'll take care of you. - I know you will, but- - But what? Now come on and help me with these. (bedsheets rustle) (dark brooding music) Okay, now all we gotta do is climb down and make it to the street. Then we're home free. You go first. I can't. I'm afraid of heights. Okay, I'll go first. You just make sure the knot doesn't slip. Then what? Then you climb down after me. I'll be there to catch you if you fall. - I don't know. - Oh, come on. Who's my sweet baby bitch? - I am. - That's right. Now quit stalling and hang on. (dark brooding music) (crickets chirp) (footsteps shuffle) (sheet slides) (dark dramatic music) What's the fuck?

Let me go, you pervert! [Cecilia] That's the pot calling the kettle black. Your deviant desires can hardly be considered normal. Sister Cecilia? What are you doing here, and why are you dressed like that? We all have our little secrets. Look, I was trying to run away and you caught me, all right? Just take me to Father Fogerty, and I'll take whatever punishment he has in store for me. Oh, you're going to be punished all right. Lutkus. (crank clicks) (Eddie whimpers) Oh my God. Oh my God. (monster roars) (Eddie screams) Oh my God! Your God can't save you now. No! No! Oh, my God! (monster roars) No! No! (Eddie screams) This sort of behavior is entirely unacceptable! I would like anyone who has any information to please step forward now. I said (footsteps shuffle) Anyone. (sighs) Very well. All privileges are suspended, (women gasp) And there will be no dessert tonight. (women yell) Miss Pulowski, may I see you in my office, please? Now. (footsteps shuffle) I'm gonna get that little bitch for this. If there's anything left of her after Father Fogerty gets through with her. Oh, that's just a warmup for what I've got planned. (footsteps shuffle) (dark brooding music) (Cherry Pie moans and cries) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (Cherry Pie whimpers) I'm certain she knows more than she's telling. Whether she does or doesn't, the girl is still gone. Yes I know. Well, are you gonna call the police again? We must report it, just as we have all the others. - What good will it do? - They never find any of them. - That's not the point. - What is the point then? This girls are our responsibility. We have a duty to do everything we can. (door rattles) (door opens and shuts) Shit. Another one? When? Well, give me a name and a description. Uh huh. Well, we'll look into it. You're welcome. (receiver clicks) Is Sheen is still out there? - Yes, inspector. - Send him in here. (door opens) (phone rings in distance) (door shuts) You wanted to see me? You remember that girl from the other day, the one who's looking for her sister? You mean that Miss Morgan. [Inspector Hinds] You haven't seen her since, have you? Why, no? Why would I? You two seem pretty chummy to me. You know, she did come to me about looking into the halfway house, but like you had said, her suspicions were unfounded or something to that effect. - I did say that, didn't I? - Mm-hmm. - [Inspector Hinds] - Some pretty crazy stuff, though, after all. Yes, sir. Will that be all? Yeah. That's it for now.

Well, he must've used some pretty harsh language. What did happen to Eddie? She's gone. What really happened to her? (voice breaks) She's gone. She's gone like the others. That's all I know. (footsteps shuffle) (muffled chatter) (footsteps shuffle) [Woman] Talk to you later. Did you find anything out about the missing girl? (sighs) Not yet. That's kinda why I'm here, padre. Well, I told you everything I know on the phone. Another girl disappears from here. So that makes six girls so far. - Five. - What? There are only five girls missing. You said six. I must be thinking about that other girl. She vanished not too far from here. Did you hear about that? [Father Fogerty] I'm sorry. I'm afraid not. (clock ticks) Really. Well, what about the others? You know, the ones from here? Do you think that anybody from here knows anything about them? Well, naturally we question the girls every single time, but they always insist that they know nothing. And you believe 'em? (scoffs) Well, what else can we do? I mean, after all, who knows what goes in the minds of young girls, especially the troubled ones? If it's all the same to you, padre, I'm just gonna a look around the grounds. [Father Fogerty] You mean to search the premises? Oh, nothing formal, you understand? And I promise not to get in the way of all the good work you're doing around here. Oh, I trust you won't. Good day, inspector, and God be with you. (door shuts) (sighs) (slow dramatic music) (door rattles) (door opens) (footsteps shuffle) (door creaks) (door shuts) (tense music) Hello? (water drips) (footsteps shuffle) Hello?

(screams) (body thuds) (slow dark music) Goodbye, inspector. (phone rings) (phone beeps) - Hello? - Larissa, it's me. Dick, I told you not to call me here. You're gonna get me busted. I had to. I think something's happened to Inspector Hinds. That asshole? Why should I care about him? Listen. I found some notes of his. Apparently, another girl has been reported missing - from the halfway house. - I know. You do? What happened? I don't know. She just disappeared. Now we want to talk about anything around here. Well, I think the inspector went out there to investigate. - You haven't seen him? - No. He left the office this morning, and he hasn't called in. That's not like him. What you find out about the rest of staff? I did some checking into Father Fogerty. - So far, he's clean. - That's a matter of opinion. What about Sister Cecilia and that handyman? After all, it was him you saw wearing my sister's headphones. I'm working on it. Remember, I'm doing all this unofficially. (muffled thud echoes) I gotta go, and wait for me to call you next time. (phone beeps) (dramatic music) What's the matter? Not so cocky without that big dyke to protect you? - What do you want from me? - We wanna get even with you. For what? For losing us our privileges. Yeah, and our dessert. But why is that my fault? Well, listen to little Miss Innocent. Where'd your lesbo girlfriend go? Search me. (women laugh) If you insist. Hold her down. Oh. She's not in there. (women laugh) Where else could you be hiding her? (women laugh) Well, well, well. Now I know why they call her Cherry. (women laugh) You mean she's never had no dick? She doesn't know what she's missing. Hey, why don't we show her? - That's a good idea. - Hold her tight, girls. This cherry's about to get popped. - Look what I found! - Wow, economy size. Hey Cherry, how would you like a date with Madonna? Madonna, the singer? You know her? Not that Madonna, stupid. (Vaseline squelches) Open wide. Here she comes. (door opens) (dramatic music) That's no way to treat a virgin. Get the fuck outta here. Yeah, this is none of your business. Maybe it should make my business. (punch lands) (dramatic music) No! Bitch is mine. Watch the door. (door opens) How do you like the taste of your own blood? Maybe you can tell me when we're done. (dramatic suspenseful music) (women grunt) Come on. Come on. (kick lands) (women grunt) Get her, Angelena! Kick her ass! Quiet! Father Fogerty's coming. (tense brooding music) (footsteps shuffle) Okay, he's gone. (dramatic suspenseful music) (women grunt) Wait, wait, wait. He's coming back. (tense brooding music) (footsteps shuffle) Okay, it's clear. (dramatic suspenseful music) (women grunt) (figurine thuds) (Angelena grunts) (women pant) (door slams open) (door shuts) (figurine thuds to floor) They tried... (pants and whimpers) - It's okay, it's okay. - You're gonna be all right now. You saved me. I don't know how I'm ever gonna repay you. (soft gentle music) (women grunt) (Lutkus breathes heavily) (dark brooding music) What are you doing? Oh these? These must've been mixed up in my laundry. I don't wanna hear it. It's after dark. Time to get rid of that detective's car. Yes, mistress. I want you to take it as far away as possible. Understand? (Lutkus grunts) Good. (dark brooding music) (Lutkus sniffs) (women laugh) (upbeat music) Will you two keep it down? What's the matter, Angelena? You got a headache? No, she's just pissed "cause she got her ass kicked. Yeah, I guess she's not as tough as she thought she was. [Angelena] I can still mop up the floor with the two of you. - Yeah right. - Is that so? Well, maybe I need to get myself some new home girls. (laughs) Go ahead if you can find anyone that wants the job. Fuck the both of you! I got better things to do than sit around with you two homos. I'm gonna find me a real man. (women laugh) (tense dramatic music) (door opens) (door shuts) (engine revs) (tires screech) (rock music) You're late, Spider! Where the fuck were you? Relax your crack, sweet cheeks. I had band practice. You actually practice that shit you play? Thought it just came out like a bowel movement. Very funny. If you hate it so bad, why'd you come to all the gigs? Forget it. Let's just get outta here. Thought we'd just pull around back. But you promised to take me away from this fucking shithole. - You got gas money? - No. All right then. Park in the back. Got any beer? (slurps) (burps) - Sexy. - I try. Couldn't you at least park further from the place? (soft choral music) Hey, all you've done so far is bitch. Now you gonna sit there all night and drink my beer, or are you gonna suck my dick? That's real sweet talk, Mr. Smooth. You think that's how you're gonna get me to go down on you? Okay, okay. Please, suck my dick. Okay. (seats squeak) (soft dark music) (heavy breathing rasps) Come on. Do it to me. Come on, butcher. Pound me like a cheap piece of meat. Come on, do it. Do it. (slow dark music) (heavy breathing rasps) Hey. What happened to your eye? Shut up and fuck. (car squeaks) Come on. Do it to me. Do it, do it, do it. (slow dark music) (heavy breathing rasps) Oh yeah, do it to me. Why are you stopping? Thought I heard something. You gonna hear me getting out of this car if you stop again. Okay, okay. (car squeaks) Oh yes! Oh! Oh! That's it. (Moans) Don't stop! (moans) I'm not stopping. I am not stopping! [Angelena] Don't stop! (dramatic music) (weapon thwacks) (Angelena screams) (blood gushes) Oh no! No! Well, I knew you'd end up here sooner or later. You people are fucking insane! Ah, ah. Language, dear. The bastard cut off Spider's head! Oh, your late friend? His head wasn't serving any purpose where it was. Now you too have a glorious future in store. What the fuck are you talking about? You will be food for our God. - No! - Your flesh will provide sustenance for a being vastly superior to you. - No! - Yes. It's an honor that you die for. Go.

Hmm. (soft creepy music) I have called you all here today to pray for our missing daughters. Two runaways in two days? That makes one a day! At this rate, we'll be empty in a couple of weeks! Now I cannot believe there is not one of you who knows something about all of this! (sighs) At first, Edwina disappears. Then Angelena runs off the following night to join her? But they fucking hated each other! Excuse me? - Nothing, father. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Apart from the profanity, I distinctly heard you say something about the missing girls. All she meant was- Yes? Angelena and Eddie didn't get along, that's all. They never would run away together. Really? Well, it seems that you two know a great deal about all of this. You two, my office, now. Carry on here, sister. (Father Fogerty snaps) (footsteps shuffle) Everyone, please rise, and we'll sing "Holy, Holy, Holy."

The power of Christ compels me! The power of Christ compels me! The power of Christ compels me! [Dick] Yes, I know about the other girl disappearing. We got the call this morning. Have you found out anything? No, nothing yet. How about you? [Dick] I came up with some pretty interesting stuff about Sister Cecilia and her creepy friend. Is there any way you can get out of there, just for an hour? What day is this? [Dick] Wednesday, why? (slow dramatic music) (truck hums) (load thumps) (door rattles closed) (door shuts) (truck hums away) (sack rustles) I can't be gone for long. What did you find? Well, it seems our Sister Cecilia has led a pretty typical life for a nun until about three years ago. What happened then? Well, she was teaching at an all-boys school when she was gang raped by some of her students, 13 of them. - Unlucky. - (laughs) It gets better. She underwent psychiatric testing and was ordered to take a leave of absence. She went on retreat in Arkham, Massachusetts. She spent a lot of her time in the library of Miskatonic University. Miskatonic. Why that sound familiar? I don't know, but guess who was working there at the same time? - The handyman. - That's right. One Charles Dexter Lutkus was working as a janitor. That's great, but still doesn't explain why. Well, there's one other thing. Shortly before they left Massachusetts, a rare book was stolen from the university library. A book. So what? Well, this book was called the Necronomicon and was believed to contain mystical spells of power. The professors there say this is the only copy in existence. So you think Sister Cecilia is practicing black magic? What next, human sacrifices? (dark brooding music) [Dick] I know, it's a wacky idea, but- - Would sure explain a lot. I gotta get going. Wait a minute. If this is all true, you could be in serious danger. - I've gotta get back. - Cherry might need me. - Who? - Never mind. Find out what you can about Necro whatchamacallit. Maybe it'll give us a few more answers. - But- - I'll call you in a couple of hours. (muffled chatter) Okay. (dark brooding music) (door shuts) (gasps) Where were you? Answer me! - Where were you? - I was out in the yard. - You were outside all right. - You were outside the grounds. [Larissa] But I wasn't. Don't make it worse on yourself by lying, and what, pray tell, was this doing in your room? I was afraid I was going to have to report another missing call to the police! I didn't run away. I just snuck out for a while. That still doesn't tell me where you went. I don't wanna say. (clock ticks) Probably ran off to meet up with some boy. That's not true. To engage in sinful carnal pleasures. Father, you've got it all wrong. Silence! It doesn't matter why you left the grounds. The fact that you did it is a serious infraction and must, therefore, be punished. Wait, please. You've gotta listen to me. Something terrible is going on around here, and Sister Cecilia is at the bottom of it. (scoffs) Sister Cecilia! Yes, I know it seems hard to understand, but she's not as she seems. She's very disturbed. (laughs) Miss Morgan, really. Yes. It's true! Her and her handyman are practicing things against God and the Catholic church. I see. So now the handyman is involved in this as well. Yes, Father, it's true, and you've gotta do something about it. Oh, I intend to. Now, kindly lean against the desk and repeat after me. (dark dramatic music) (dark brooding music) (door opens) - Larissa. - Cherry, you gotta help me. What's happened to you? Oh, I just went 10 rounds with Father Fuckhead and his holy paddle of discipline. Sit down. I don't think be sitting for awhile. Listen, Cherry, I gotta tell you something. I'm not like the others girls here. I know you're not. - No. I do not mean that. - I'm here undercover. You some kind of cop? No, no, but I'm working with one. I'm trying to find out what happened to my sister. I think there's a connection between her disappearance and those that have happened here. You mean like Eddie. I thought she just ran away. I think that Sister Cecilia and that handyman have something to do with all this. - What can I do the help? - I need to search her room, and I want you stand watch. I don't wanna get caught again. (tense music) (door opens) Pretty smooth you picked that lock. Just one of my many talents. Save it for later. I want you to stand at this door and let me know if you see anybody coming. Okay. (footsteps shuffle) (door opens) (door shuts) - It's gone. - What is? There used to be a cross hanging here. I wonder why she took it down. I hope it fell on her head, that awful bitch. Keep looking that way. (cloth flaps) (dramatic music) Jesus Christ. (footsteps shuffle) (dark tense music) (phone rings) Hello, Larissa? It's me. I found much more stuff about the Necronomicon book. Hello? Are you there? (phone thuds) Larissa. What's going on? Hello? Hello! Damn. (tense music) (drawers shuffle) (drawer shuts) This is it. - Someone's coming. - Who is it? (dramatic music) It's Sister Cecilia. I'm sorry I'm not a good look out. I'll try it better next time. There won't be a next time. Hand over that book, Miss Morgan. Hand it over, please. Look, I don't know what you're doing with it, but I'm not the only one who knows about it. Oh, yes. Your friend, the young sergeant. I expect that he'll be here looking for you. It's a pity that he's never gonna to find you. (dramatic music) Larissa! (Lutkus laughs) - There will be two tonight? - No, not this one. She must be found far away from here, and must look like an accident. I don't wanna raise any more suspicions. What are you gonna do to me? You, my dear? I'm going to invite you to the dinner. Really? What are we having? (slow dark music) (restraints rattle) It won't be long now. As soon as Lutkus takes care of your friend, it will be your turn. Sister Cecilia, you look different. Oh, I hope this idiot doesn't take all night. (slow tense music) What the- (punch lands) (body thuds) - Are you okay? - I'll live. You were right about the Sister Cecilia and that book. Oh shit. According to my research, the Necronomicon holds the secrets for bringing back the Old Ones. The Old Ones? They're a race of monstrous beings that once ruled the planet before man. Supposedly, they're trapped in some other dimension now. By performing rituals that are described in that book, a gateway will be open, and they'll be able to reenter our world. What happens to us? We'll all be destroyed. - We've gotta stop them. - Where is she now? I don't know, but I know someone who does. (Lutkus grunts) - Where's Sister Cecilia? - No, I'm not gonna tell you. (gun cocks) - How about now? - Okay. (footsteps shuffle) - Down here. - That figures. My shoelace is untied. (footsteps shuffle) (elbow thuds) (Dick grunts) (dramatic music) I can't believe that you fell for the old shoelace gag. Shut up and go follow him. (Grunts) (footsteps shuffle) (footsteps shuffle) (hiss echoes) (dramatic music) (Larissa screams) (weapon thuds) (Lutkus laughs) (slow dark music) (Dick gags and coughs) (Larissa cries) All this time, I was trying to protect you from getting hurt. (coughs) Don't talk, don't talk. I'll get you help. No, no. There is no time for that. You've gotta stop her. You've gotta stop her. (gags and grunts) (Larissa cries) Bastard. (up-tempo tense music) Get away from her, you bitch! Larissa. You came for me! Just what the hell kind of weird shit is going on here? (slow dark music with chorals) Since you're so persistent, I believe I'll tell you. Beyond that door lies the vanguard of a new age, an age where man will be replaced as the dominant species of the planet. Why the hell would you wanna do that? Because man is a filthy, vulgar creature, ruled by his own lust. He's not fit to even touch the sanctity that is woman. I put myself above such animal passions. But that wasn't enough. I was raped, defiled by the very impure creatures that the church told me to love. But then I found a truer, older faith, a belief that the vermin of humanity could be purged by a superior race. Where have I heard that before? And just how are you gonna accomplish all this? I unraveled the secrets of the Necronomicon, and I have brought forth a being that will father a new world, and I will be its mother. You mean you plan on fucking some monster from beyond and having its children? You're a lot sicker than I thought. I have committed my body to the future ruler of the planet. What about my sister and the others? - What happened to them? - Nourishment. He needed to eat to build his strength, to bridge the gap between his world and ours. Even the future ruler of a planet needs to eat. I have heard enough of this heresy! Sister Cecilia, I am shocked at what I see in here. First, I find that you have allowed these girls to leave their rooms after lights out! Second, I have heard you expounding beliefs contrary to Holy Mother Church. And third, you are out your uniform! I could not expect your puny mind to grasp much less embrace your future. You and your impotent God will be destroyed like all the rest. Blasphemy. I cast you out! (Cecilia cackles) (monster roars) (dramatic music) What in name of God is that? Oh that, that's your destiny, you and all the other pathetic doomed members of your race. (Father Fogerty chants in Latin) (Cecilia laughs) (Father Fogerty screams) (bones crunch) (Lutkus laughs) (Larissa screams) (Cecilia laughs) (body thuds) (Father Fogerty grunts) (clippers thud into chest) (Father Fogerty screams) (gunshot blasts) (Lutkus grunts) (Larissa whimpers and grunts) (body thuds) Well, that's finished. (gasps) (footsteps shuffle) (Lutkus screams) (knife pierces flesh) (Lutkus grunts and screams) (gunshot blasts) (women grunt) (bodies thud) You can't destroy the world for your own selfish reasons. Oh, yeah? I can, and I will. (Lutkus grunts) You think your religion is any better? Sure, love they neighbor as long as he thinks the way you do. (Larissa grunts) (Lutkus grunts) You condemn the church because it's run by men, and man is fallible? The church says I have to go through man to get to God. Well, I plan on eliminating the middle man. You have to go through me first. (dark dramatic music) (crank thumps and clicks) Oh, shit. (monster roars) (Cherry Pie screams) (Lutkus grunts) (Cecilia cries out) (monster roars) No! (gunshot blasts) (monster squeals) No! No, no, no, no, no! (gas can thuds) (Larissa grunts) You. (monster roars) (tentacles slither) No. No! No, I'm your bride! Let go of me! No! No. No, no. (Cecilia screams) Looks like the wedding's off. (monster roars) (Cecilia screams) (bones crunch) No, no! (Screams) (gas can rattles) Stop! Stop! (bones crunch) (flesh squelches) - Let's get outta here. - No, not yet. I gonna finish it. (gunshots blast) Smile, you son of a bitch! (gunshot blasts) (explosion booms) (slow dramatic music) You did it! You saved me again. Let's get hell outta here.
