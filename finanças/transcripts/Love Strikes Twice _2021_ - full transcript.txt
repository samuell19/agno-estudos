This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. - Because the situation is blowing up. I don't have time put out every fire your client feels like starting, that's why. Well, sure, but enough with the demurrals and the stalling tactics, counselor. Well, that's what I'm saying. I suggest that you settle. You know if I get you into court I'll burn this case to the ground. - And the kitchen's on fire again. - What? I was gonna make us eggs. - But then you answered your phone. - I did, yeah, I did. It's the Phitzer case. The opposing counsel is being really uncooperative. - Well, they are the opposing counsel. - Thank you. Oh, hey, I'm not gonna be able to get away to pick up that silver tray for my parents' anniversary party tonight. Can you do it? - I have history tutoring after my last class. You know that. - Josh, can you cancel it just this once please? Honey, this case has got me really- - That's every case. And I'm always the one that picks up the slack. - Please. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Maggie Turner. - Bon appetit. - Hey, Melissa. - You're in bright and early. - Good morning, Mr. Baxter. I didn't think anyone else would be in. - There were transactions I needed to manage before the day gets started. - I'm just taking care of some things myself 'cause I have to leave an hour early today. It's my parents' 40th wedding anniversary. A big party, tent in the backyard, that kinda thing. I will be taking work with me, and I'll be available on my cell. - I like that attitude. And what you did with the Inova case, the way you completely dismantled opposing counsel in the courtroom, that was very impressive. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah, you've become quite the barracuda. - Well, I'm just hoping to swim with the sharks one day. - Reviews come up next month. We should discuss a junior partner slot. - That's very exciting, Mr. Baxter. Thank you. - You know the real carnivores in the firm can call me Mal. - All right, Mal, I will keep that in mind. I'll leave you to it. - Please do. - I'm here! Where's my contract? Whoa, haven't seen you this intense since rush week. - Kappas forever. - So, I was thinking that after I sign my life altering contract, we could play hooky. I wanna go shopping for something for your parents' 40th anniversary. - Oh, honey, that's so sweet. You don't have to come. - I wouldn't miss it, but I do need to know the dress code 'cause currently all I have are swimsuit prototypes for next year's line and old bridesmaid dresses. - I asked mom. She said, "festive casual." I told her nobody knows what that means. - How would you know? So, when was the last time you went anywhere that wasn't business attire? - Okay, fine. If you're giving me a hard time, I can bill you for this conversation. I was going to congratulate you. Sign where the flags are and you will officially have expanded into premium outlets. - Yes. Maybe now my mother will stop bothering me about Lester. See, I can commit. - What about Lester? - Ugh, we broke up. I just couldn't see myself marrying Lester. - Fair. - I just need to find what you and Josh have. - I don't know if you want that . - No, you guys are good, right? - I don't know, I don't know what we are. I feel like he's always so disappointed in me, and I thought that we both knew what it would take for me to make partner here, right? I have to be a killer. And sometimes it's like I can't turn it off with him, and I just wonder sometimes if he would be happier without me. - No, don't say that. If you two can't make it work, then I have no chance. I am pinning all my hopes on you guys. - Oh, that's good, no, that's great. Thank you so much. That's just what I need, more pressure. Congratulations, Miss Entrepreneur. - Oh, that actually reminds me. You will never guess who I ran into in the lobby. - Who? - Rick Morgan. - What? - He had an entourage. - I thought he was based in Seattle? - Yeah, he is, but he's here meeting with some PR firm. Something about a new solar company. - You talked? - Yeah. He actually recognized me. - Wow. - And he asked about you. - He asked about me? I am surprised he even remembers me. - Oh, because you only dated all through college. Honestly, I always thought you and Rick would get married. - Hm, the road not taken. That is my conference call. - Oh, so no hooky? - Sorry. - I'll see you Saturday. - Hello, this is Maggie Turner. - Kappas forever. - Hey, Jackson, I meant to tell you earlier. We're expected Callahan. - Tell him we'd like to see a deck for the new campaign by Monday and I'm gonna send it to the Seattle office. - And to accept that counter offer sometime later this afternoon. - And then we'll see if we're able to buy- - Not so much. Oh, excuse me. - Excuse... Maggie. - Rick, hi. - Hi. - Carrie was just up. She told me that you were in the building. - This is crazy. How are you? Do you wanna grab a coffee? - Yeah, yes. - Uh, bump the- 00 to a- 30, and the00 to a video call from the jet. - You know what, I just realized I can't. I'm sorry. I'm so late, Josh is gonna kill me. - Oh, yeah, Josh. How is he? I heard you two got married. - We did, yeah, we got married. After I passed the bar and he got his doctorate in history. - Well, I won't keep you then. But I'll be back here in three weeks if this PR things work out. Call your office to setup lunch. - Yeah, I'd like that very much. - Looking forward to it. - I'll see you then. - Yeah. - Bye. Well, no, because it's not a counter offer. It's an insult. Listen, I need a real offer on my desk by Monday, and I'm talking mid sixes or the deal is off the table. Yeah, fine. Oh, come on. - We wouldn't be traffic if- - Yes, I know, thank you. That must be a good book. What's it about? - About 200 more pages. I'm testing the kids on Monday. - Hm. You know it's not like you can get an F, you're the teacher. - Just because I don't negotiate six figure deals, it doesn't mean what I do doesn't matter. - I don't, I didn't say that. I never say that. You used to like to tell me about what you were reading. - Oh, hey, can you pull over? - Mm hm, yeah. You thinking about the old library? - Yeah, the city tore it down and the lot sat empty for so long they built this eyesore. - Yeah, who knew the developers would run off to South America with the investors' money. I know you love the library, but I miss Flannigan's. - This whole place really went downhill after the library was gone. - Hm. It wasn't all bad though. It brought us together, didn't it? - I don't think pity makes a great foundation for a relationship. - Why would you say that? - The only reason we started hanging out, Maggie, was because you felt sorry for me. - That is... That's not entirely true, Josh. - Oh, come on. I tried to save the library, it got demolished, I was crushed, it's not like you noticed me much beforehand. Let's not rewrite history. - There they are! - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, honey. - You can hire a gardener you know? - Oh, I'm just cleaning up the beds before the party. - Yeah, what happened to all your flowers? - Oh, you know, I just, I didn't really feel up for it this year. - Hm. - How's my favorite son-in-law? - Your only son-in-law? - Tomato, tomato. How's your dad? Is he still liking Phoenix? - Yeah, he says he'll take the heat as long as he doesn't have to live through another Illinois winter. - George! - Is that Mags and Josh? Or are you talking to yourself again? - Oh, hush, you. Your father thinks I'm losing it. - She scurried around for half an hour the other day looking for her keys and they were in her hand the whole time. - This one didn't even give me the heads up. - I couldn't get a word in. You keep talking to yourself. - Ah. - To be fair, I also talk to myself. - Well, don't blame me. You get it from her. Ash, come say hello to your sister. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, how are you? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I wish people would stop worrying. - Hey, George. - Hello, son. - Ash isn't still living with you, is he? - No, he has that studio apartment behind the Pick 'N Save. - Huh. - Sup? - Hey. - I made a pitcher of lemonade. I thought we might all eat out on the patio. - Okay. - Sounds great. Ash, what are you up to these days? - Just the same thing. - That's not entirely true. Ash got a promotion last month. He's now assistant in charge of... What is it again? - Software upgrades and app installations. Really not a big deal. - But still, assistant in charge, that's pretty cool. - As smart as Ash is with computers and all those things, he could be running the entire place over there if he'd show a little more confidence. - Oh, whatever. It's just a, it's a dumb job. - So, Maggie, how's work with you? - Mm, work is pretty great actually. I won a big court case last week. And this morning one of the senior partners mentioned there might be a junior partner slot coming up, so. - How about that? - Hey, is Dad okay? It seems like he's having more trouble getting around. - Oh, well, you know, he has good days and bad days. But the way the fall tore his spinal cord, you know I just kick myself. I shoulda made him throw out that rickety old ladder years ago. - It's not your fault, Mom. - Are you going back to work? - I'm just, I'm checking my email. I always check my email before bed at home. - But we're not at home. - I'm aware that we're not at home. Do you think maybe here you can tell me what's going on with you? - Us, Maggie. What's going on with us? Sometimes I look at your parents and I get sad. They've been together for 40 years and they still like each other. We've been together for 15- - And you... Are you saying that you don't like me? - I'm saying that sometimes I'm not sure if we ever should've gotten married in the first place. - Okay, okay, that's not... That would be something that we would need to talk about. - Not here though, okay? We'll talk about it when we get back to Chicago. - Sure. Should I, should I just sleep in my old room? Should I- - Whatever you want, Maggie. - Whatever I want, okay. Um, I'm gonna go for a walk. - Okay. - I wish I had a do-over. Oh, shoot. Ow! Ow. Josh? Ow. Where's my phone? I'm gonna kill him. Mom? - In here. - Mom, where's Ash? He took my phone. I can't do anything with something this ancient. - Your dad and I just bought that for your graduation last week. How fast is technology moving? - Mom, you look great. Your hair looks good. - Stop teasing. I have an appointment to get it done before the party. - What? - Honestly, George, we do have glasses. - Dad, what's happening? What's going on? - Okay, I admit it. I was jogging. I'm trying to up my cardio so I can spin your mother on the dance floor all night long, huh? Whoa, hey. - You're a sweaty mess. - Oh. Come on, babe. Oh, shake it. - George, stop it. - And the big spin. - Oh, no. - Stop it! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Woo hoo. - Woo hoo. - Use the hips. - Okay, look, I know you're mad, but Josh... Carrie. - Mags. - Carrie, oh my gosh, okay, listen. I don't know what's going on. Something happened. I had a fight with Josh and then I went for a walk, and then I, I, I, I made a stupid wish I guess. And then I hit my head and then I woke up. Okay, but now, everything's different, but it's not different. It's the same as it was, but it's not the same. It's the same as before, but like before, before, you know? - Mags, what are you talking about? Sounds like you just had a strange dream. I dreamt about this big octopus, and now I feel kinda weird about going into the water. BT dubs, you need to get here soon. Derrick is rocking some board shorts. - Sweetie, are you okay? You looked a little pale when you dashed out. - Yes, I'm, listen, Carrie- I'm gonna have to get back to you on the shorts, bye. - Rick, she'll be down in a minute. - Okay. - What? Wait? Who? - Hey, babe, are you coming? Everyone's gonna be at the lake already. - Uh, you know what? I don't think I can. I have too much to do today. - Yeah, going to the lake. - What are you talking about too much to do? Yesterday, all you and Carrie talked about was the lake. Look, your beach bag is already packed. Oh, honey, I know it's been stressful with LSATs and law school applications, but that's all behind you now. Go, enjoy yourself. You're only young once. - Hi. - Hey, beautiful. - Hello. - Oh, cute beach bag. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Hi, ooh, holy moly. - Oh? - That's just, needs to be over there. - You're not still mad at me are you? - I don't know. Maybe, why? - I was just repeating something stupid my dad said, and I'm sorry. Can we just get a do-over? - Yes. Yes, we can because this, this is a do-over. - And I know just how to make it up to you. - Okay. Ah, ooh, yep. Just, just one of those. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, my gosh, it's Flannigan's. I loved Flannigan's. - Best banana cream pie in the world. - It is. - Am I forgiven? - I think so, yeah. Wow. - Thanks so much, I'll see you at the rally. - Josh. - Maggie, you're back. - Yeah, hi. - Hi. - What's up, Turner? - Just trying to save the library, Rick. Getting ready for a big rally tomorrow. You should come. - Ah, no can do. And besides, it's not even the library anymore. So, what's the point? - It's part of our town's history. We wanna repurpose it. What about you, Maggie? - I can try, yeah. - Hey, we're hitting the lake, so good luck. Come on, Mags. - Sure. Bye, Josh. - She's back. - Whoa. - They haven't even built the pavilion yet or the park. - Okay, you're kind of in a weird mood today, but can we go be weird in the lake? - Yeah. - Come on. - Yeah, sure. - Oh, there she is! - Hey, oh, my god. Hi, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hi. - Okay, check it. Derrick at 10 o'clock. - That certainly is, yeah. - It's purely professional. Look, if I'm gonna be the next Vera Wang swimwear, I'm gonna need a men's line. - Man, you are just exactly the same as I remember you being. Sorry, today, now, now, that I remember you being currently the way that you are. - And you're a nut job. - Yeah, um, I'm kinda dealing with a lot. - Ugh, yeah, I know. I'm dealing with this best friend who's being a total buzzkill. Mags, I'm gonna need you to just chill out, and go with the flow this summer, okay? - Yeah, that's... Yeah. - Exactly. Like I'm not even gonna think about being an adult until September. - Okay. - Okay, I have an idea. Come on. - Okay, whoa. - Woo hoo! Kappas forever! - Kappas forever. - Kappas forever. No, no, no, no. - Um, I guess have fun at the club tomorrow. - Oh, yeah, I get to be my dad's golf partner. I hate it when he's between wives. Oh. - I, I will, I'll see ya. - Yeah. - Hey, you know what? I um, I had fun today. This was a whole day and all I did was have fun. - Well, there's more where that came from. See ya later. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, what are you doing? - Just hanging some lights. I'm trying to dress this place up before the party next week. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. This is too old. It is shaky, you need to throw it out. - Don't be ridiculous. You don't throw something away just because it's a little shaky. Fine. - Thank you. Hi. - Speak, what brings you to the realm of Ash? - Oh, I remember this. Okay, so- - No, don't mix those up. Don't mix those up. - I'm not mixing them up, you dork, I'm sitting down. - Well you're touching them. Don't don't them. - I'm not touching your stuff. Relax, okay, this is important. Something's going on with me and I don't think Mom and Dad would understand. - Hm sounds ominous. I'll pass. - I'm going to tell you something. And you are probably going to think that I am crazy. - Er, you're crazier. - Duly noted. - Mm hm. - Okay, , yesterday I was 37 years old. I lived in Chicago with my husband. I was a lawyer at a prestige law firm. I was about to make a junior partner, and this morning I woke up and it was 15 years earlier. At first I thought that maybe it was a dream, but my dreams are never this linear, and they usually involve Sonia Sotomayor, so she's not here. Um, say something. - Are you outta your mind? - Maybe. - Okay, why should I think you're doing anything besides yanking my chain? Okay, fine, tell me something from the future then. Yeah, go ahead. - Um . Oh, oh, oh, so those books. That book series that you like with the dragons. - Mm hm. - They make it into an epic series, everybody loves it. It's all anybody talks about for ages, especially at the end when like nobody thinks that Arya's- - Stop! Don't say anymore. - Okay. - Okay, okay, okay. I'm not saying that believe you. Okay, I'm not. But if I did, I do happen to have a time traveling theory. A couple months ago I was having an argument with some of my guys in my DND group, right? - Department of Defense? - What? No. Dungeons and Dragons. - Okay super nerd. - Oh, I'm sorry, did I just walk into your lair and claim to be a time traveler? - That's a good point. I may have lost the high ground. - We were arguing about time nomads, right? - That sounds like a comic book, yes. - It's a graphic novel, okay? Can you please take this seriously? - Yep. - All right, thanks. Anyways, there are articles out there. A couple by actual neuroscientists. They have case studies of people who have claimed to have slipped back in time. They theorize there was some kinda mutation inside their brains that is triggered by stress. The article describes it as amnesia, but instead of people forgetting who they are, in these rare individuals, they seem to have forgotten when they are. - I mean, that could be me. - Yeah. - I am stressed. What is that anyway? - Oh, this? This is my prized possession. I've been working on it for six weeks. Sweet, huh? - That's a long time. - Yeah. - Can I see it? - Um, yeah, just be very careful, okay? - I'm a grown up. - Hm, okay. - So, like... - Not yet. - Hey, you know what? I got some upstairs stuff to do, so I'm just gonna leave you with that. Thank you so much for all of your help. Good bye. A time nomad. Okay, well, if that's true, I should just, I should just be able to remember. Right? Okay. I am 37 years old and I am gonna wake up in Chicago with my husband. Ugh. No, come on. 37, Chicago, husband, go. Fine. Hello? - Well, I'm heading off for a fun day at the club. Dad and I are playing golf, so there will be lots of criticism on my swing. Yay. I just wanted to hear your voice so I'd have something to be happy about. - Aw, well that's really sweet. Hey, I'm rooting for you today. Do good, uh, do you know, good golf. - Thanks. Have I told you that I'm just crazy about you? - I think you just did it. Bye. - Bye. - Hey. - Hi. - Where's Mom and Dad? - Errands stuff. - Hm. You're staring. - Were you goofing on me last night? Are you gonna tell me you're an alien today? Or what's new? - Nope. Still just your run of the mill regular old time traveler. - So you still remember being 37 and you're married to some Chicago dude? - Oh, no, not some Chicago dude. I married Josh Turner. - Your dorky friend from high school? The guy you were on the academic decathlon team with? - Yeah, Josh. - Oh, my gosh. - After he couldn't save the library from being demolished I felt really bad for him and we started hanging out more. And we fell for each other. I guess that's how it started. - Yeah, for you maybe. - What's that supposed to mean? - That guy's like-liked you since he was a freshman. - What, okay, how, how did I not pick up on this? Can you come to his save the library rally with me? I'm starting to feel like I need to get closure on a whole relationship that hasn't even happened. - I don't even wanna know what that means. - It's just in the future it seems like we're such different people. I feel like a bad guy all the time, and he just seems so defeated. And well, not now, he will be. And I just, I feel like the library is the key. If I help Josh save the library, then he'll be fine. And he can go down whatever path makes him happy, and Rick and I can go on like we should be. Like we should have been... I don't, I don't know. - Wow, I was hoping you'd tell me the future is filled with flying cars. Who knew it would just be you and your boring drama. Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. - Come on. Your classmates are gonna be there. Cheerleaders are gonna be there. Mom says you like one. - What? No. No, I don't, okay you know what? That's none of your business actually. Mom shouldn't be telling you that. - Not my, but I'm your sister. I'm allowed to know stuff about you. Come on. - Okay, fine. But I'm only going in case you do any weird time traveling stuff. I wanna see that. - Yeah, totally. - Hey, um, what am I like? - You're like a big, huge dork, duh. - No, no, I mean in the future. I'm not gonna be you know, like this forever. Am I? - Oh, honey. Hey, you know what? In the future, you're like, you're kind of amazing. - Yeah, sure. - No, you are, trust me. You're this like big genius software developer. Apps. - Those stupid little phone games? - Okay, but in the future there's an app for everything. 'Cause right now, phones are just getting started. But just, just trust me. Remember apps, boom! They explode, huge. Dad brags about you all the time. - No way. Your dad brags about me? - Yeah, he does. He talks about your confidence. Be ready in an hour or I will leave without you. I've never noticed that at all. - No? - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - I already said that. - Yeah. - I just, I wasn't sure if you'd show up or not, so hi. - Hi. Yeah, I'm sorry we're late. My timing lately has been a little uh, it's been a little weird. - True story, bro. - How's it going, Ash? - Well, I'm at a save the library rally, so I'm livin', man. - Thanks anyway. - No problem. - Really sorry about him. Um, how can we help? What's the plan? - Uh, well, we got a bunch of high school kids. The cheerleaders are over there making signs. There's another group trying to paint the signs. So far it's been a lot like herding cats. - Well, you know what? It is your lucky day because Ash is really great at making signs- - Painting. Making signs. - You're doing a good job. Okay, go. - Um, yeah, there's girls. - Mm hm. - And they're cheerleaders. - Remember what Dad said. Confidence. - Okay, you're right. - I believe in you. - Have fun. - Thanks, man. - He'll be fine. - Wow, this is awesome. Do you need help? - Bulldozers come in two days. - Tearing it down is not gonna be an improvement. - I know, right? I mean, sure it's old and needs repairs, but this is part of our town's history. Part of our country's history. Benjamin Franklin started the first lending library in 1731. Did you know that? - No. - We got to where we are today because libraries like this offer education for everyone, not just the rich. It's places like this that make America truly the land of the free. What? You're staring at me. Is something on my face or? - No, I'm not. I'm not, I'm really not. Okay, I was a little bit. Sorry, I just... You're just different. I haven't seen you this passionate in a while. - You haven't seen me in a while. - Sort of, yeah. Kinda. So, okay, bear with me. I get it, libraries are important, but they built a new one on Parkside and they've already moved all the books over, so what's this really about, Josh? - Some of my earliest memories are my mom bringing me to story time. She loved books and this place in particular. Growing up spending so many hours here, after she died I guess I liked to go and sit in her favorite spot in the reading room just to feel closer to her. - How could I not know that? - Why would you know that? - No reason. - Hey, we have a bunch of water and snacks. Where do you want them? - Uh, listen, how about you deal with that, and I'll go motivate the sign painting crew. - Oh, thanks. - Yeah. Sounds like they're ready. - Why are the cops here? I have a permit for this. - It's okay, I got it. - Yeah, you really got it. Thanks for bailing me out, Mr. H, but you really didn't need to. My dad, he'd come pick me up as soon as he got off work. - Nah, I figure you're good for the 50 bucks. We'll drop you at your house, but don't even think about skipping town. - We will find you. - Don't worry about my parents. They're harmless. Oh, you're not. Come on, what are you doing here? - Are you kidding me? I'm here to witness the utter demise of my saintly, perfect, straight-A, favorite child sister. I wouldn't miss this if you threatened me with the Hydralon Seven torture pod. - Okay, smart guy. First of all, I do not consider this my utter demise. Second of all, there's no way I'm the favorite. - Quit sniping, you two. You know your father and I don't have favorites. You're my favorite. - I'm standing right here. - Excuse me if I'm a little bias toward the offspring who will not be spending time in front of a judge. - That's not gonna age well. - Besides, honey, I'm sure you are your father's favorite. - I hate to break it to you, buttercup, but I just wanted a dog. If your mother wasn't allergic both of you kids would be cocker spaniels. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? That's my little puppy. - Oh, Mom, I can help clear if you want. - Oh, no, honey, you relax. You must be exhausted. - From jail. - We're getting a lotta mileage outta this one. - For at least a couple more days, yeah. - Mm hm, got you. - Hey, it's our song. - Aw! - Come on, come on. You have to. We must dance. - No. - Honey, if we don't stop you won't get dessert. - I have everything sweet I need right here. - I'm gonna throw up. Can you please just get a room? - I did, a bunch of 'em. So as long as I'm paying the mortgage here, I'll dance with my wife. - Nope, still happening. - I just don't feel good about you going in there alone. - I'm not alone, Mom. I have you guys. - We should've called your dad's friend. What's his name? Helped us with the room addition. - Yeah, Sid Lawrence. Smart fella. He works close by. We could get him here pretty quick. - Daddy, I love you, your friend is a paralegal, and this is just a preliminary hearing. Josh and I will be fine. - I just don't want you to do anything that's gonna get you in trouble. - But don't worry if anything happens, we'll visit you in prison. - Prison. - Boys, this is serious. - I am serious. - Okay, family, family. Hi, focus. I've got this, okay? - Just don't push it. You're not a lawyer yet. - Sure. Come on. - In the case of Maggie Hartman and Josh Turner, do you have representation? - Your Honor, I'll be acting as my own attorney. - Oh, boy, here we go. - I would also like to speak on behalf of Mr. Turner. - Could we have a moment please? - Why not? I doubt any of us wants to get out of here at decent hour. - Ah, thank you, Your Honor. What do you think you're doing? I thought we just plead guilty and do community service or something? - No, we don't wanna do that. I've got this. - That's what you said yesterday. - Okay, I can understand your skepticism, Josh. I need you to trust me. Can you do that? - Mr. Turner, do you suppose we will be continuing with these proceedings anytime soon? - I also would like Miss Hartman to represent me. - Very well. What do you have to say for yourselves? - Your Honor, we are being charged with the incitement of civil disorder, is that right? - You are correct, young lady. - So, the definition of this infraction is willfully causing or creating an impediment with the sole intention of interfering with a law enforcement officer carrying out their official duties. Is that right? - Well, at least you've done your research on the charges, which is more than 90% of people who represent themselves. But Miss Hartman, do you have a point that actually addresses this charge? - I do, Your Honor, submitted into evidence is the authorized permit for the rally at the library. - I see, and? - Well, given that the permit for the rally is valid, the issue of underlying cause is absent. Therefore, as issued in the State of Illinois versus Camden, the lack of underlying causes renders the subsequent arrest invalid. I move that this case be dismissed with prejudice. - Hm, well, this certainly took a turn. Illinois versus Camden you say? Good reference. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Underlying cause is quite relevant here. With that in mind, I'm going to rule in your favor. This case is dismissed with prejudice, and the arrests shall be stricken. - Thank you, Your Honor. Um, Your Honor, while I have the court's attention, I would like to beg a moment of your indulgence if I may. - Oh, dear. there is an issue of grave importance that I'd like to discuss. - Hm, this afternoon is turning out much differently than expected. - Thank you, Your Honor. We believe that the very character of this town can be found in the old library. Yes, the plaster is cracked, the paint is faded, but there's a good foundation. And the library is important not only to the history of our town, but to each of us individually. And currently, bulldozers are set to destroy this building. Now, I have here paperwork to file a temporary restraining order against the demolition of the library at Main and Grand. May I approach? - You may do so. You know as a child, that library was where I learned to read. I have to admit it's not often I'm surprised, but you, Miss Hartman, have done just that. All your T's are crossed and your I's are dotted. Very well. Unless evidence to the contrary is presented as to why demolition of the library is imperative, a temporary restraining order is granted for 14 days. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Where did that come from? - I uh, I watch a lot of Law and Order. - You must. - That was my daughter. - Hi. - She did it! She saved the library. - Hey, buddy, back off the girl. It's bad enough you got her arrested. - Okay, wow, wow. First of all, the girl, hi. Second, Josh didn't get me arrested. It was the other way around. - I don't think that matters to my father. I had to spend the better part of my morning explaining why I'm dating a jailbird. - A jail, sheesh. A jailbird, seriously? - You can explain it to him. He has requested that you join us for dinner tonight at the club. - Your dad did? - Yeah. - Wow, okay, yeah. - Let's go. - Sure. - It won't be so bad. I'll see you tonight. - Okay, bye. - Objection, overruled! - Oh, hi. Hi, you. - Oh, you were a boss out there. Okay, so, your friend Josh, he's a cutie. I was thinking about asking him out. What do you think? - Yeah, you know what? He is great and you're great, so that would be, that's... Why wouldn't that be great? - Awesome possum. Okay, I'm gonna see if I can catch up with him. - Okay. - You getting in or are we camping in the parking lot? - I mean, honestly, Dad, at this point I'd take either one. - Right? - So, what's this nonsense I hear about my son's girlfriend getting arrested? - Oh, that, yes. Well, um, the case has been dismissed and the arrest has been expunged, so it's- - Expunged? - It's expunged. - This is how you kids are talking these days? - Oh, . No, I just meant that it's been totally like, like, like wiped from the record, so. - Okay, well that's fine and good. But why were you even there in the first place? - Oh, I was helping a friend. He's trying to save the library. - Why? I personally donated money to the new library out in Parkside. It's much better, trust me. - Well, you know, just because there's a new library doesn't mean we have to let developers bulldoze the old one. - Oh boy. - When did developers become a dirty word? This country was built by developers. - Okay, nobody's saying developers are evil, Dad. So, can we please save the lecture about how the first vehicles on the road to progress were... Okay. - Michael Williams is trying to turn that property into something useful. And he's a friend. - Is he? Is he a friend that you do business with? I'm just curious. - Yes, I plan to invest in the project. And do you know how much tax revenue this new development will bring into the city? In addition to a community center for at risk youth. Housing for low income seniors. - What Maggie came here to say is that it was a mistake being there and she's sorry. - No, no, it's not. The situation was blown out of proportion. It was not a mistake to be there. And I am not sorry. - But she's never done this sorta thing before, so let's just cut her some slack. - Some slack he says. I never needed slack. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Looks great, mm. - Well, I'm so sorry to have caused problems for you. I would at very least like to hear more about the project. - Okay then. Maybe this girlfriend of yours has some sense after all. Dig in. - Are you okay? - I just wanna make so much money that I never have to hear one of his condescending lectures again. - Hey, you will, okay? I know that you will. - I'm glad at least you believe in me. Thank you for that. Promise me you won't let me turn into him, okay? - Yeah, I promise. Hey. - Oh, hey, honey. - What you doing? - Just looking at pictures for the party. Oh, will you look at that. Were you old enough to remember? That summer your father grew that handlebar mustache. - Seriously? - Ugh. - Wow. - Aw, there it is. That is where your father proposed. - Huh. How did you know that he was the one do you think? - Oh, I don't know if he is. - What do you mean, what does that mean? Are you guys having problems? - No, honey, no, it's nothing like that. - Okay. - No. I adore your father. And he had better say the same for me. But I think this notion of the one does people a disservice. It gives folks the idea that all you have to do is meet the one and then it's smooth sailing forever. People buy into that and then when things get rough, and there's always a point when things get rough. It makes it too easy to bail and look for the one somewhere else. - How did you two get together? - Well, when I was your age there were several young men vying for my attention. All of them were very nice. I think any one of them coulda been the one. Although, your father did check off a lotta boxes for me. He was handsome and bright and always good for a laugh. But I didn't go into the relationship thinking, "oh, he's definitely the one." Because I think that love is a choice. It's a choice we make on a continual basis. Hey, is everything okay? - Mm hm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just, I had a bit of a strange day. I think I might go to Flannigan's and get a piece of banana cream pie. - Ooh - Always makes me feel better. Do you wanna come? - No, I think I should go through this other box of pictures. - Okay. - Hey, I love you. - I love you too, Mommy. Do you live there now? Are you wearing aftershave? That's a new shirt. What's going on? - So, what if it is? Nicki and I are going on a picnic this afternoon. - Nicki, no, no, no, no, no, hold on. I thought you were hitting it off with um, what's her name? Veronica. - Yeah, duh, Veronica. But her friends call her Nicki. And now, I'm one of her friends. - That girl was Nicki. Oh, no, no, no, what have I done? Hey, no, you come back. I have questions. No fancy towel stuff. - Mm mm. - Come back, come back here. Do not slam that door. I will take you back to the brontosaur! - Kids, stop slamming the doors. I'm doing a load of whites. - Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, no. - Feel strongly about laundry, do we? - We can't let Ash date this Nicki person. - What are you talking about? He's finally come out of his shell a little bit. - Mom, you don't get it. Okay, she is horrible. She's the girl who toys with him all summer. And then when they go back to school she breaks up with him in front of everybody at the Homecoming Dance. It destroys him. He never recovers. - Someone's a negative Nancy. And what's with the grammar? Your tenses are all over the place. Is it too late to get a refund on college? - Yes! - Oh, your young man is here. - Rick? - No, the other one. - Oh, gosh. - The game was unbelievable last night. - Don't even talk to me about it. - I mean, we were completely robbed. - Wait, robbed, who was robbed? What? - The Cubs. But that's nothing new. - Okay, hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Oh, right, barracudas. - Okay, care to expand? - You know how yesterday I told you you saved the library. - Yeah. - And I was so pumped about that. - Mm hm. - That might've been a bit premature. This morning I got a phone call. Apparently Michael Williams Investments- - Who wants to buy the library? - Yeah. - Yeah. - They're teamed up with a high octane law firm out of Chicago. Luckman and - - Seriously? Luckman, Reed and Baxter? - No, just Luckman, Reed. - Oh, of course, Baxter wouldn't be partner yet. - What? - What? - Why, have you heard of them? Is this bad news? - Uh, I think ironic is the word that I'm looking for. Of course the developer would have them on retainer. They're one of the best law firms in Chicago. - That's not reassuring. I'm headed to Chicago to meet with one of the lawyers this afternoon. I barely had enough money to print fliers. I certainly don't have enough to hire a lawyer. I'm doomed. - Mm, no you're not. You are not doomed because I am gonna be at that meeting. Huh. Oh, wow. You look, you look great. - I'm sorry? - Your suit is lovely. It's a great, it's a great suit. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I'm Malcolm Baxter, senior counsel for Michael Williams Investments. - Hi, I'm Maggie Turn... Maggie Hartman is me, is my name, and this is Josh Turner. - Well, I'm gonna get right down to business. My client has put considerable time and effort into the property at Main and Grand. Now, we understand that you might have some emotional attachment to the existing structure. So, we are prepared to offer you a stipend for your trouble. Take your time. - Okay, rule number one of settling out of court, you throw money at it and see if it goes away. - Are you kids trying to play hardball? That is cute. I have to admit, that is cute. But I'm sure you can think of more enjoyable ways to spend your summer, so. Maybe this will help. - Why is he doing it like that again? - I don't know, it's just such a long table. I, we got your point, just thank you so much. - Take your time. - Yeah, you definitely took yours. Okay, rule number two, if a little money doesn't work, you throw a lotta money at it. - That would buy a lotta books. Never have to go to a library again. - Mr. Baxter, that's not why I'm doing this. There are more important issues here. - You have issues? - Yes! I have issues with your client disregarding heritage and history. - Right, because anytime someone wants to develop a property people start throwing around the word history. Listen, I'm gonna write another number down- - No, no, you're not listening. Do you know anything about this building that we're trying to save? Does your client? In the 1800s, after Andrew Carnegie made his fortune, he decided he wanted to make the world a more peaceful place. And he knew the only way to do that was through education. So he built 2,500 libraries all over the country. And this building that your client's so anxious to tear down was one of the very first ones completed. And I know as strongly as I know anything, that he had the right idea. And that idea lives in this library. I don't think we should tear something down just because it's old. I think we should leave things better than we find them. I'm sure you can agree. - Do you do this a lot? Does he do this a lot? Listen, I have dinner reservations. And the minute I walk out, that offer disappears, and so does your library. - Well, we hope you enjoy your dinner because we will see you in court. Okay, we're storming out now, Josh. - So, you want me to- - Yes, please. - Got it. - Thanks. You have yourself a nice day. - Miss Hartman, might I have a word alone? - It's all right. - I'll wait outside. - Okay. How can I help you? - I think the question is how can we help each other? After a brief consultation with my client, I'm prepared to take the offer we made you in there, and increase it by 50%. You'd have it in your bank account today, and no one needs to know. Throw in a little something for your boyfriend. - He's not my boyfriend. - Oh, I don't care. - Okay, listen, as much as I am enjoying this riveting little round of divide and conquer, we've made it pretty clear that we are not interested in money. So at this point you're starting to look a little desperate. - Okay, what is it you want? - The library, were you not listening? - Well, that's not going to happen. - I mean, a judge might disagree with you. Isn't that why you're in here with your big numbers on your little pieces of paper? - Listen, young lady, I understand you're having fun playing dress-up and interfering with the adults who are trying to do business, but I am part of a machine. It's the kinda machine that grinds little naive girls like you into dust. So, don't mess with me because you have no idea who you're dealing with. - Actually, Mal, I know exactly who I'm dealing with. I think the problem is that you don't. How much do you know about your client? Did you do your due diligence on Michael Williams? Or were you just really fast to cash that retainer check? Because I happen to know more about you and your client than you could possibly imagine. So, I guess the real unknown factor in this equation would be me. And there is nothing, nothing more dangerous than an opponent you don't know. And you know where I learned that from? From you. - Tenets that are outlined in Kelo v. New London, and Lingle v. Chevron USA Inc. - Your Honor, Mr. Baxter is misrepresenting those rulings. - If I might be allowed to finish. - Miss Hartman, you will be given your turn to present. Proceed, counselor. - Thank you, Your Honor. Allowing these kids to stop the demolition is not only a grave infringement of my client's rights, but it could leave the city open to charges of breach of contract. Therefore, we demand that you overturn the restraining order. Thank you. - Miss Hartman, you have some thoughts on this matter? - Yes, I do, Your Honor, thank you. The case law that Mr. Baxter is citing is only relevant in issues of property ownership. Now, the court should be aware that at no point has Michael Williams Investments purchased the library property. We'd like to enter into evidence the city's contract with Michael Williams Investments as exhibit 4-c please. - Duly noted. - Now, a review of this contract reveals that Michael Williams Investments entered into a favorable lease agreement with the city. In return they promised to build a youth center and low income seniors housing, and therefore access large city redevelopment grants. Now, those of us who oppose the demolition of the library understand and respect the rights of legitimate developers, but we believe that Michael Williams Investments quite frankly aided and abetted by opposing counsel have been deliberately misrepresenting their intentions. - Your Honor, that is conjecture. - He has a point, Miss Hartman. Can you back this up? - Well, we've noted in the contract where the city is provided a good faith deposit with the company. However, the majority of the construction grants won't be made available until after Williams carries out the demolition. This is why they're following through on this. Michael Williams has no intention of delivering on his contact. He's just desperate for a payout. - That is not only rank conjecture, but also slander. - Miss Hartman, do you have proof? - I do not at this moment, Your Honor. If I had some more time I would probably be- - Time, time. Your Honor, every day these people delay inflicts financial hardship upon my client. We strongly urge you to overturn the stay. - Understood. Is there anything else before I make my ruling? - No, Your Honor. - The weight of the law leans heavily towards the validity of legally binding contracts. Lacking any new and significant information as to why Michael Williams Investment should not be allowed to fulfill this contract, I'm afraid I have to rule in favor of Michael Williams Investments. Your order barring demolition of the library is overturned. - Thank you, Your Honor. We expect demolition to start within the next few days. - I was supposed to fix this. I was supposed to make sure it would be okay. I was supposed to make sure that you would be okay. - Hey, you did the best that anyone could. - Thanks. - Well, Miss Hartman, A for effort. Now, I do hope you're able to find more useful ways of spending your time instead of interfering with grown-ups. - Hi. - Hey, I'm sorry you lost. But for what's it worth you were amazing. - Thank you. I just, I don't know. I can't help but feel like that should have gone differently. - Hm. - At least your dad's friend will be happy, right? - Maybe, but let's forget about all that 'cause I'm gonna take you somewhere nice for dinner tonight. - Okay. Why would they do that? You know this actually is cheering me up. - Oh, I'm glad because now that the whole library thing is behind us, I wanna move forward. - What do you mean? - Now that the case went in my dad's favor, I know he can forgive and forget. - Sorry, what do I need to be forgiven for? Isn't your dad an investor in this project? - Not yet, he was waiting to see how the case would shake out. Now that it's settled, he's going for lunch with Michael Williams at the club tomorrow to go over the financials and finalize the investment. - He really shouldn't do that, Rick. - Look, I know you don't like Michael Williams, but it would make it lot easier on everybody if you just got over it. You making things difficult for my dad's friends, I'm sure you could see how he would take that as an affront. I know your heart was in the right place. You were just helping a friend. - What? No. And I don't want them to demolish the library, Rick. - Yeah, but what does it matter? We're meant for far greater things than this town. And I have seen how forceful and passionate you were in that courtroom. You have ambition. That's how I feel about the businesses I wanna start. We're gonna go places. So, what does it matter if there is or isn't an old library in a town that we're gonna leave behind? - Because we should leave places better than we found them. Thank you. - Thank you. Well, talking about better, I wanna talk about us. - What about us? - The term power couple, that could describe us. Wouldn't that be something you're interested in? Well, I have been thinking about it since we first started dating freshman year. And three and a half years later, I am even more impressed and more in love with you than ever. Maggie Hartman, would you conquer the world with me? - Yeah, okay. Yeah . Oh my gosh. Cheers. Dad. - I'm just texting Ash so he can come hear your big secret news. - Dad, use your thumbs. - What? - Gotta use your thumbs. It's faster if your use your thumbs. No, okay, so you have to hit the key the number of times for the letter that you want. - I just deleted everything. - Dad. - Oh this is never gonna catch on. Okay, we'll just tell him later. What is it? - Okay. - Oh, would you look at that. - You suppose that boy might come inside the house now instead of just honking outside? - I mean, maybe. - Invite him for lunch tomorrow. We'll celebrate. - We should plan that. I know that tomorrow he has to be the fourth for golf for his dad and Michael Williams. - No. - Thought I might find you here. - Yeah, figured I'd come say goodbye before the bulldozer showed up. Congratulations. - Oh, yeah, I wanted to tell you myself, but I guess news travels fast. - It is a small town. - Yeah. I'm sorry. - About the engagement? - No, about the library. - Right. I know it's just an empty building, but it's about what it represents. - Mm hm. - The power and importance of words; words are knowledge, they're ideas, they're the tools we use to build our thoughts. So, they're important. Words like community, justice and I love you. - Josh, Josh, I... I don't think you really know me. I don't know if you ever did. - I know you're smart and passionate. You fight for what you believe in. You help where help is needed. You're brave, tenacious. You always see the best in people. Even Rick. - He's not a bad guy. And he loves me, he really does. - I know, I know. I can tell by the way he looks at you. - Listen, I would be lying if I said I don't have feelings for you because I do. But I don't wanna hurt you. I've only ever wanted you to be happy, Josh. - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything- - Oh, no, no, no, no, please don't. Don't be sorry. - I want you to be happy too. I mean it. So, I guess Rick's the one, huh? - Ah, yeah, I guess. - So, do you think you're gonna do a big country club wedding or an over-the-top destination wedding? I don't know, somewhere exotic. Brazil, I dunno. - Brazil. - Nah, you're right. You should probably do like Paris or something. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not the wedding, Michael Williams. Brazil doesn't have extradition reciprocity, that's why he goes there. - Why do you know so many things? - Michael Williams is getting checks from Rick's father and another investor at the country club tomorrow. I would love to know what kind of financials he's claiming. - Well, we could... Nah, it's stupid. - What, what? - Oh, I was just gonna say that we could I don't know, sneak in and steal his briefcase. But that's just- - Yeah, that's the kinda thing that gets me disbarred. If I were a lawyer, which I am absolutely totally not, so. - I mean, like I said, it was a stupid idea okay? - Is it? Hi, there. We're just looking for job applications. - All right, go on through. - Thank you so much. Have a good day. - Just some normal people. - You go get job applications for our cover, and I'm gonna get the laundry. - Okay, let's go. - Hello. Listen, I know you have thing about wearing other people's clothes. - What, how would you know about that? I mean, not that that's a thing that I have a thing about. I don't have a thing about that. - No, of course you don't. Um, can you wear this shirt please? - On my body. - Josh. We're not members. We have like two seconds before they kick us out. Nobody gives the staff a second look. It's like an invisibility cloak. - Okay, Brett, Brett, my name is Brett. I play a lot of Xbox. I wanna put sweet, sweet rims on my Hyundai Elantra. - You okay? - Yeah. - I don't know how you make it through the world as yourself. You good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - You gonna live? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good. - Good, great, great. And if I have timed this correctly. - There you go. - All right. - Nice. - Let's do it. - You just have to trust me. It's not that hard. All right. Hi, hey, there, Helms. Listen, there's a little old lady in the sauna. What'd she say her name was, Brett? - Vermelle. - Vermelle, Vermelle is saying that she lost the key to her locker, and now she's headed towards the dining room in a towel. So, do you have a spare we could borrow? - Are you kids new? - Yes, yes, we're very new. - Yes. - We started a couple weeks ago. - You processed my badge. - You did. - You kids are starting to blend together. I stay the same, but y'all just keep getting younger. It's chow time, so I got nobody to take over. So, take the master key. But if this isn't back in my ring by the end of my shift, I will come and find you, Jocelyn. - Hope you do. You have yourself a great day, sir. Okay, let's hit the men's locker room. Oh, gentlemen, I'm gonna need you to give me just one minute. Thank you so much. - Um, hi. Uh, I just fired up the sauna if you wanna you know, grab a fresh towel. 15 minutes in there and you'll be new men, huh? Maybe? Nice and refreshing. Get a good schvitz in. Yeah, enjoy. It's fine. Nothing to see here. Just Brett with some towels. Go, go, go. - You should keep that name tag. You seem to like it. - What? - Hey, a little bit of help! - Okay. - Should we just pull over here? - No, keep going, keep going. - What about here? - No, not yet. - Why not? - Just keep going. - I am going. - Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Here. While you were charming Helms out of the key, I was clocking where the security cameras were. Besides, cigarette butts. This is where the staff smokes so they can't be seen. - Props to Brett. You are revealing a criminal mind I did not know existed. Respect. - Don't give me props yet. Tried it, flopped. - Yeah, I figured it would be. One second. I went through a phase where I wanted to be an escape artist as a kid. I kept locking Ash in the basement. But I came away with a skillset. - Now who's the criminal mastermind? Is it in there? - Yep. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm up from billing and our copier is on the fritz. I really need to get these reports done. - Sure, okay. - Oh, thanks so much. Great. - Hello to you, sir. - Still got it. - Oh, sorry, just one second. - Ugh, why so tiny? - Hi, excuse me. Yeah, hi, hello. - Hi. - Uh, Jocelyn. - That's me, yep. - You could stop texting your boyfriend. - Oh, he's not my boyfriend. - I called housekeeping 20 minutes ago. Those hampers are practically overflowing. - Right, yes, and that is why I am here. - And you should be there. Thank you. - Thank you. That's really nice. Wow. - Anytime. - Hey, just give him a second. - Man down . That's what- - Come on, help me. - Okay, okay. - Are you all right? - No, I'm not all right. - Come on, get off it. - Piece of cake. Yeah, Dad, I got it. - You gonna be okay. - Yeah. - And at least it's bandaged. Okay. - Ow, ow. - No. - Doing well. - Your son hit me a golf ball. - I know, well, what can you do? It's just a little more this way. - Hi, there, could we get medical to the clubhouse please? It looks like there's someone coming in off the golf course. They appear to be having a heart attack. Oh, thank you so much. Bye, bye. - Okay, come on. It's not a heart attack. - He just sprained his ankle. Did you order this? - Oh, hi, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. - I was able to copy 90% of the towels. Here, take these, take these. - Go, go, go, go, go, go! - I'm going, I'm going as fast- - Go faster than you're going! - Okay. Have you seen a rat? - You gonna be okay there? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Excuse me, can you move your cart? We're trying to get in the locker room. - Yeah, sorry, my brake's broken. I'm gonna need like a second to fix it please. - Oh, here, here, let me help. There you go. - Oh my gosh, you're really strong. - The brake's fine. - Thank you. You have a great day, sir. - You too. - Bye, bye now. - You're gonna be fine, okay? - It's fine. - I know you wanted to get 18 holes in, but wanna just change and get outta here? - Yeah. - Okay, good. Hey! Could we get some towels? These attendants are crazy today. - Yeah. - Go, go! - I'm going! - Go, go, go! - I'm going! - I can't believe that worked. - That was amazing. - Oh, hey, Katheryn. This is a copy of Kennsington's Investors list. Let's see what we can find out about everybody in there. - Okay. - Thanks. - Tracey, hi. - Hi. - How's it going? - Good. I help with bookkeeping for my dad's construction company. - Great. - These are account numbers. The money from the city and the investors should all go into an escrow account. But here's the thing, the account numbers don't match up. - So, what's going on? - We don't know. Unless I like hacked into the accounts. - And see, that would be unethical and I could not ask you to do that. - So, I shouldn't? - Tracey, come with me. I would never ask you to do that, just like I would never ever tell you that you should take all of these things and bring them to the basement where Ash has the best computer and the WiFi is very fast. - Right, I'm not going to hack these accounts at all. - No. - And yeah, you guys have super fast WiFi. - Oh, this is nothing. When you get down there, tell Ash that in the future, WiFi speeds are going to blow his mind. He'll get it. Hey, Tracey, your shirt is really cute. - You like it? - I like it, but my brother's gonna love it. . - What do we do if the judge asks us how the new information was obtained? - I find in that case the best defense is to get incredibly offended. - Miss Hartman, we must stop meeting like this. People will talk. - People always talk, Your Honor. We hope to give them appropriate reason. - Your Honor, I would like to point out that we have already resolved this matter. Miss Hartman is filing nuisance motions as a means of wasting the time of the court and myself. - This court assumes that you are billing your clients for everything on this case. So, our definitions of wasting time apparently differ. Now, it looks like the court is being asked to invoke a permanent stay against demolition of the library. So, have a seat, Mr. Baxter, and let's hear what Miss Hartman has to say before we toss around words like nuisance. The floor is yours. - Thank you, Your Honor. Your Honor, we are asking this court to reinstate and make permanent the injunction against the demolition of the library. - On what possible grounds? - On the grounds of new information that has recently come to light. If it'd please the court, we'd like to submit into evidence documents we have labeled exhibits F through P. - I move to disallow. We haven't been informed of any new documents. - I'm sorry, Your Honor, I'm sure that Mr. Baxter knows as well as I do that his is a hearing, so the rules of disclosure don't apply. However, I have made copies for opposing counsel, although I feel that their client will be more than familiar with the contents. - Uh, Your Honor, we would move to have this new evidence excluded on a cursory review it would appear that this evidence is unfairly prejudicial. - Your Honor, we maintain that these documents have a highly probative value to this case. - Additionally, it would appear that many of these documents have been stolen from my client's briefcase. - Stolen, you say? Miss Hartman. - Your Honor, I'm outraged. Is Mr. Baxter really accusing me of theft in a court of law? I mean, he of all people should know that such outlandish accusations without underlying proof are slanderous and highly actionable. - The young lady does have a very valid point. I'm assuming you would not want to open yourself up to that type of legal exposure. So, what proof do you have? Are the originals missing? - No, they don't seem to be. But these two pages are wrinkled, indicating tampering. - Wrinkles. You would like me to throw out evidence because of wrinkles. I like to pride myself on my patience, but it has limits, Mr. Baxter. It has limits. Your motion is overruled. Now, Miss Hartman, would you care to explain to the court what we are looking at. - Absolutely, Your Honor. Michael Williams presented document F to the city as a means of securing funding. That is a list of his 45 primary investors. We did some research on this list and it does appear that 29 of them are deceased and 11 are currently incarcerated. - Mr. Baxter? - Thank you. Exhibits K through M show a series of transactions between escrow accounts meant for construction funds. However, you'll see that the funds were transferred to a subsidiary company, Platinum Holdings. And later used to purchase property in Bahia, Brazil. The sole proprietor of Platinum Holdings is Michael Williams. - Whoa, dude. - Your Honor, you last time we spoke you asked for proof that Michael Williams intends to defraud the city. I feel like these documents connect the dots. Thank you. - I take your assertion that these documents were obtained illegally as proof that they are in fact valid. - We may not have reviewed them closely enough, Your Honor. - Well, perhaps I can help in your review by turning these documents over to the State Attorney General. And Mr. Williams, until they have come to a conclusion, you are hereby ordered not to leave the state. In light of this and the current petition facing this court, I am granting a permanent injunction against demolition of the library. Court is adjourned. - You did it. - Thanks. Okay. - Miss Hartman. I'm not accustomed to being bested. Especially not by someone I assumed was a novice. - And yet, here we are. - Yes, here we are. - Hm. - Give me a call if you need a recommendation for law school. And there may be a place for you at our firm. That is if you can prove you have what it takes to swim with sharks. - Oh, Mal, see the thing is, I um, I think I just did. - You were amazing. - Thanks. - Get a room. - This is awkward, I don't know him, so it's really embarrassing. - Well, all is right with the world. - Yeah. Almost. Okay, you ready? - No! - Okay, on three. - This is my dad's truck. - This is my dad's spine. - What? - One, two, three, go! - Happy? - Nope, back it up. - Happy? - Nope, one more time. - Happy? - Now I am happy. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, you look beautiful. - Aw, well, thank you. Happy your parents' 25th anniversary party. - Oh, thank you very much. It's all about me. Hey, where's Josh? I thought you guys were coming together? - Yeah, he was supposed to, but he is in love with someone else. - Ah, yeah, I'm sorry about that. - How does that someone else feel? - It's that obvious, huh? - Hm. - Okay. I don't know, I don't know. I, I, I guess I didn't really expect it to get this complicated. - Hey, while we're on the topic. - Uh huh. - Can I have a look at that complication? - Mm hm. - Wow. - I know. - Maggie. - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. - Can we talk? Somewhere quieter? - Yes, yes, we can. One second. - So, my dad wanted me to tell you that- - Oh, it's, it's okay. He doesn't have to thank me. - No, he's furious. His friend's getting indited because of you. - His friend? His friend who was gonna scam him? He's mad at me? - You don't know my dad. He hates being proven wrong more than anything. But what I don't get is I thought we had put this behind us? We were supposed to conquer the world together. But now you're back in court going against all that. Why would you do that? - I mean, it was the right thing to do. That's gotta count for something. - I asked you to marry me. That should count for something. - It does. It really, really does. It's just, it's not enough. I think that the idea of you is just wrapped up in somebody I thought I wanted to be. - I don't know what you're talking about. - I know, I know you don't. I'm um, I'm really sorry, Rick. I'm sorry. I don't want a do-over, Josh Turner. - I can't hear you, Maggie Hartman. Maggie? Maggie, can you hear me? - Sweetheart? Sweetheart, are you okay? - Honey? - What? What, what happened? What's goin on? - You must've hit your head pretty hard. You were out for about 30 seconds. - I was? Oh, it felt way longer than that. You're going gray. - Are you sure you're okay? It's been coming in for a few years. - All right, it's a good thing I am dating a doctor. He's just grabbing his bag from the car. - Oh, gosh. Um, Daddy, were you dancing? - Well, what do you expect? It's not everyday we celebrate our 40th anniversary. - Ash! Um, I just uh, I just got back. - What are you talking about? - I just got back. - No way, seriously? - Yeah. And you're here with Tracey. You're here with Tracey! - Yeah, sis! We came in from Palo Alto yesterday. We have a couple more months before I can't fly. - Oh my gosh, I'm back. I'm really back. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. - Sweetie, are you sure you're okay? I mean, that was quite a bump you took. - I'm fine, I promise. I want you guys to go enjoy your party. I just need some rest. - You're sure? - I really am. - Let's get you home. - Okay. - Where's uh, where's the car? - Uh, honey, you guys walked over here. But I can drive you home if you're not up for the 10 blocks. - I think that's a good idea. - No, no, I'm fine. - You sure? - You sure? - Yeah, I am. - Aw, I love you so much. - I love you. - And you too. - Put some ice on that bump, okay? - I will. - You look after her. - Will do. Go have fun. - We did all right. - Yeah. - Oh my gosh. Oh, look. The library, it's so beautiful. - Library? - Yeah. - No one's called your office that in years. Are you sure you're okay? - I just had the strangest sense of deja vu. I thought that, I thought that we lived in Chicago, and I worked at this big firm. - Okay, all right. We're definitely getting you checked out tomorrow. - No, no, no, no, it's okay. I'm okay, I obviously know that we live here, and that is my office and you are the school superintendent. - And we're the local power couple. - Does anybody actually call us that? - I do. - Do you? - All the time. - All the time? - All the time. - That's enough for me. Let's go home.
