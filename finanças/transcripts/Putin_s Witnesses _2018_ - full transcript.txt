Have you already opened your present? - Not yet. You're so patient, Vitaly. Girls! Is this for me? - Yes. Girls! Look! Mummy's unwrapping her present. Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Presents are there, come on. Who has this one? - There are names on them. Chocolates! And lollipops! Nika, now show your happy face! How do you like the chocolates? - Yummy, I love them. Lyova! You have no present, have you? Lyova has no present. - Poor thing! Songs with lyrics. - Yeah. Natalia, any success with TV? Come to me, beard! Nothing to add. - Nika, turn around. She bought a New Year present for everyone. But what about you? Look at you, dear! It's hilarious. I want to say just a few more personal words than usual. I want to ask for your forgiveness. Who'll address the people at midnight? Putin?! Stop it! Let me relax. Why are you stalking me?! Mum, stop it! What a freak! What seemed simple, turned out to be tormenting and difficult. Leaving behind the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past and finding yourself in the bright, rich and civilized future. I myself believed in this... Honey, open the door! Get lost with your camera! This is a chronicle. - Enough harassing us with your chronicle! Leave us alone! We're human beings! Why are you stalking us all the time? That's a chronicle! Vitaly, it's enough. It's getting on my nerves, I cannot... Do you know what happened? - But why are you shooting me? Who else? - I am about to burst into tears. I believe that time has come... Would you like me to say something high flown in front of the camera? I told you, I'm shocked! The "firm hand" has arrived that the nation is so fond of. Let's see how he'll tighten the screws. It's horrible! We'll remember Yeltsin's time as an epoch of happiness. We'll think we had lived in Utopia. Do you agree with me? - Sure, I do! So why are you... Talk to me! I think it's a nightmare. Our Utopia is gone all of a sudden. What will become of us? I am leaving... There hasn't ever been a President like the incoming. I did all I could... - A grey and modest mouse... not according to my health, but on the basis of all the problems. Such a dirty trick on New Year's Eve! Now who will address us at midnight? Putin will! Words fail me, you know. Words fail me. The world is shaken, it'll be afraid of us again. Nika! Have you had a wash? Can you come out in your robe for a sec? Have you heard what happened today? - I did! And what do you think of it? Dad, put away your camera! - Don't yell! Do you know who's our President now? - Yes, I do. Putin. Shut the door! Shut the door! In accordance with the Constitution, as I resign, I have signed a decree, placing the duties of the President of Russia on the head of government, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness and calm. Happy New Year! Happy new century, my dear ones! That's it, get out! Dad, it's not funny. Shut the door! Dad, let me shoot you and you'll tell me your opinion. Okay? - Do you think I have an opinion? So, you don't have one? Sweetie? - Yeah? But our life's fun, isn't it? - Indeed! Because he's like Mao Zedong, as Mum said. Who's like Mao Zedong? - Our new President. Like Mao Zedong? - He was also a dictator. Dad, that's it. Go and get ready for the New Year. Let's say it nicely and clearly. You've called the Mansky family on New Year's Eve. Best wishes for the New Millennium! Hooray! Call us tomorrow, either on the pager or the cell phone. Happy New Year to everyone! Bye! Happy New Year! Dear friends! On this New Year’s Eve, my family and I, just as you probably did, planned to listen to the address by the President of Russia, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. But things took a different turn. Today, on 31 December 1999, Russia’s first President decided to resign. He has asked me to address the nation. Dear citizens of Russia, dear compatriots! The powers of the head of state have been turned over to me today. The presidential election will be held in three months. Vladimir Putin took over the state, the Russian Federation, from the hands of Boris Yeltsin who resigned voluntarily. He took it over with its Constitution, its colours and its anthem, the basic symbols of the new and democratic Russia, having replaced the Soviet symbols, seemingly left behind in the past for good together with the Soviet Union. By the way, the shift in power on New Year's Eve, moreover, during the transition to the New Millennium, was a really wise decision. In line with a longstanding tradition, the whole state drifted into a state of rampant revelry, incapable of sober analysis of the ongoing events. At the same time, during these days Russians were supposed to get used to the idea that now they will have a new President. During these very days I started shooting a film that was supposed to serve PR purposes for Putin's electioneering. We'll do as follows. We'll order you about a little with your permission. May we? - You may. Much of the footage was included in my old film about Putin. The audience discussed trivial details, like the watch on his right hand, rather than listening to his actual message. But reviewing the shots today, I noticed that already as Acting President Putin clearly defined what some worship and others curse him for. Our main goal is to make people believe in everything we say and do. That ours is a heartfelt position, dictated only and solely in consideration of the national interests. Solely that. This is the key to success. If people believe in it... that's the main thing. Did you get it? The task is to convince the Russian people that national interests are more important than the individual. Meanwhile, his electioneering was in full swing. Although, publicly Putin did not announce any electioneering. He was just omnipresent on all the TV channels. Everybody reported to him on TV: governors, army and security people, work collectives, rural labourers, children and old folks. And everybody was happy about him, which partially reflected the actual state of affairs. And his technologists skilfully modified his image from the "firm hand" to a glad-hander. Can you stand there, in the back? Rest on the knee for a while. Fling the jacket over your shoulder. Shut your eyes for a second and relax. Look at me kindly. As kindly as you can. However, the key element of the electioneering was reliance on the army and threat to the security of Russia. Therefore Putin, naturally, spent Defender of the Fatherland Day in the Hero City, Volgograd, communicating with the veterans of the long-gone Battle of Stalingrad and promptly, in the spotlights of all the Russian TV channels, turning to the heroes of the new victorious war in Chechnya. I would like to seize the opportunity and thank the Russian people here, in Volgograd, particularly, for the support of our army. In two and a half months of non-existent electioneering... Let's act according to the plan. Putin managed to visit almost all the regions of the state. And, certainly, on 8 March, the International Women's Day, The Acting President, at the same time candidate for presidency, symbolically enough accompanied by all the principal TV channels, arrived in the womens' capital of Russia, the city of weavers, Ivanovo. What kind of TV campaign spots are you going to have? Will you participate at any TV debates? It is my opinion that people involved in practical activities, either in the Parliament or in Governmental authorities, have to prove their competence with practical deeds rather than TV spots or any other advertising devices or means of advertising. The so-called TV debate is one of them. TV campaign spots even more! That is advertising. You don't need to find out during the electioneering whether Tampax or Snickers are more important. Therefore, I won't be doing it. That is true. Putin did not sink to the level of campaign spots or TV debates. As far as I remember, all the rest debated, emphasizing the chosenness of Putin. Obviously, it was one of the main tricks of the electioneering. My team meticulously documented the candidate for presidency in his unremitting toil for the benefit of the people. Before, in a film made by my colleagues and I, we had asked: "Who is Mr. Putin?" and his childhood friends, classmates and neighbours answered. I found the memories of his class teacher as the most emotional of all. Apparently, she had exerted a special influence on the formation of his personality. Thus I proposed to Putin that he could visit his class teacher. Soon Putin flew to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his former boss. We were informed that he would, all of a sudden, visit Vera Dmitrievna. So we went to her home to wait for her guest. Hardly anyone suspected that so many people would arrive to bid farewell to the paragon of the half-forgotten ideals of the romantic epoch of the first wave democrats. A line of people, stretching for hundreds of metres... Look at the line! Today it's cold outside. - It is. Vladimir Putin, a former student and aid of Sobchak, was among the first who arrived to bid the final farewell. It was obvious that the head of the state arrived at the funeral ceremony not only as an official figure but also as a friend of the family offering his personal condolences. Security measures applied in St. Petersburg today were unprecedented and distinctly different from the standard. All concerned Vladimir Putin. Yet the day before the secret service reported on an assassination attempt. Sergei Devyatov, the representative of the Federal Guard Service, said that in this particular case not a single psychopath but an organization was behind the attempt. Specifically, the Chechen rebels. For the first time the security services... That's awful! Came up with a public announcement rather than keeping it top secret. Many have already associated it with the upcoming election. I'm so worried about him, every day. My day begins when I turn on TV and listen to where, who and how... I'm so worried that I cannot open it. Hello! - Hello! - May I come in? Yes. - Hello! However, the arrival of the Presidential Security Service spoilt the surprise of Putin's unexpected appearance. I knew it! It's not so easy to fool me. As soon as they entered the classroom, I already told them, "You've just thought of doing something and I already know it!" Vera Dmitrievna, calm down! You say that you are nervous, but I can feel it; I have a seventh sense. Always and about everything. Vera Dmitrievna, please! I'll pull myself together! Please. Or we'll have to cancel it. - No, no, I'm fine. But on that day, Putin returned to Moscow, not having visited his class teacher. Just a week later he returned to St. Petersburg, this time to meet Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of Great Britain. The protocol of this meeting was considered quite provisional: visits to the Hermitage and Peterhof, a joint briefing, and a premiere at the Mariinsky Theatre. Leningrad! Leningrad! Leningrad! The Kirov Theatre! The Kirov Theatre! NATO, go home! It goes without saying that the importance of this visit for Putin's electioneering manifested itself in the fact that the West represented by the UK Prime Minister, demonstrated its support for Putin and its wish to see him as the President of Russia. Most probably it was the first time when Putin appeared in the Tsar’s Box as the leader of the state. It’s hard to picture the feelings of the guy raised in a St. Petersburg communal apartment, having joined the elite of the world at breakneck speed. During this official visit to his hometown Putin did meet his teacher. Why not do it in advance? Good evening. - Good evening. Guys, would you step aside? They'll ring, and you'll open the door. They won't think of it. - They will. This became the final episode of the electioneering film that I produced and that was aired on the state TV shortly before the day of the Presidential Election. Hello! Certainly, this episode made up by me and approved by Putin characterized the hero in the most positive way in the eyes of the Russian electorate. Although, it made no fundamental changes in the election scenario. Anatoly Borisovich is also at home. Tolya! Sit down, sit down. How am I? As you see, nothing new. We've just moved the sofa from one side to the other. What's happening with the sparkling wine, Vera Dmitrievna? I do have some. Well, to our meeting! Okay, ready, one more time... Say, "Cheese!" That's great! Now we'll both have a talk. Sit down the way you'll be sitting. I cannot yet... As they say, teeny weeny... Don't look at me, Vera Dmitrievna. - Right, I'll look at him. Goodbye, good luck. Take care. I'll call you when I find it out. Alright. Won't you forget? - No, I won't. Sometimes you do forget... Remember how I almost missed the train because of you? When you promised to take me on your... - Bone shaker? He's not there, and I'm already late for the train... It turns out he has forgotten! Do excuse me for... - It's alright. I've kept you for so long. Don't let anyone throw it out. I won't. I'll have it myself. I'll have it after a drink. The state is like a garden - you have to destroy the weed so that something worthwhile grows. We’ll do just that! Let's take it as an electoral mandate! You just remember that I follow your every step, every gesture! Tie me by the leg. No, no! Do whatever you have to. But do remember! Take care. Thank you. - It's time to win. It's time to win. This phrase turned into the slogan of Putin’s electioneering. But to me personally and, as I assume, the majority of Russians, the beginning of Putin’s electioneering dates back to a time long before he was appointed as Acting President. The beginning of Putin’s electioneering has a fixed day, hour and even a minute - 8 September 1999, 11:59 PM, when in a sleepy suburb of Moscow, loaded with bags of hexogen, a residential building with its inhabitants was blown up. One more house followed in five days, and then the explosions broke out all over the country. I remember very well how military patrols began appearing in the buildings and on the streets of cities. The country was stricken with fear. The man in the street, having gained an ear for the media, clamoured out louder and louder, demanding the "firm hand". Vladimir Putin was appointed as Prime Minister 22 days before the first explosion. He became the sixth Prime Minister of Yeltsin's administration, so his rating was almost zero. Irrespective of their origin, the explosions appeared of benefit to his rating, which during the next seven months grew up to 50 per cent. The famous quote, "We’ll rub them out in the outhouse," became a new symbol of the time. By the end of the working day, Putin accepted our offer to go to the site of the first block of flats blown up in Moscow. Are you here for the first time? Just to be clear, neither then nor now could I actually believe in Putin's personal involvement in the bombings of these blocks of flats. But the fact is that by accident an attempt by FSB officers became known to plant similar hexogen sacks in the basement of a block of flats in Ryazan. This event allowed serious questions to be posed to the authorities. Do you believe that the end justifies the means? The end justifies the means? - Whose end? I did not get it. Their goals? Do they justify the means? The goals of the terrorists? - Yes. Can you actually...? I believe no sane person can ever decide on such an act. To blow up a building with people in it... Innocent people... At night! It's really... It's beyond me! It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. It's inhuman cruelty! We just have to understand... We can counter this only by force! Otherwise we won't... We won't safeguard our state and protect our people. On 13 March, half a year had passed from the day when the block of flats on Kashirskoe Shosse was blown up. Now there is nothing left, except of a chapel and photos of the horrible tragedy that had occurred on Kashirskoe Shosse. Just some twenty metres from that place there is a school where a polling station is situated. People from the nearby houses came to vote here. Many needed no campaign. Half a year ago they made sure that only strong and rigid rule was needed in order to protect. Vitaly, let's go! Do you really think we have to vote? - Yes, I do. Even if nothing depends on us, at least we won't be for the communists. Will our vote matter? It's hard to tell. But let's go anyway. It's important to us since it's the first time we can vote as registered citizens. Before we were nothing. So, we're going to vote. Chechens do not want to lay down their arms and they do not use the opportunities provided by the Russian Parliament. They are not making use of the Law on Amnesty. Whoever does not comply is waging war. Are you worried? - No, not at all. Vladimir Vladimirovich, tell me please... They say there might be an outbreak in Chechnya, related to the election. Are you in control of the situation? Any signs of resistance? All the necessary security measures have been taken. We have information on militant action in Chechnya. It is clear why. This matters more than who they will vote for. It's important that they vote, knowing they have voted for the future President. They will demand appropriate actions for their republic. I think that is very important. And I have every reason to believe that the election in Chechnya will be successful. Thank you. Good-bye! Would you step back from the car? The press left the polling station with Putin. Only one French journalist remained to interview the former President of the USSR, Mikhail Gorbachev, who came with his daughter and granddaughters, to cast his ballot. May I ask for whom you will vote? Let's wait and see... Gorbachev abstained from responding. Greetings! However, having cast his vote, he did not deny himself the pleasure of having a drink with his former colleagues. Am I not taking anyone else's place? - Sit down, sit down! Here's to you! Cheers! - Thanks! I just wanted to say that I am proud that at the Congress I was the first to speak and say that the President of USSR should be elected immediately and there should be only one candidate. We do remember! They tried to persuade me, "You should agree for two or three years." And I said I won't. Mikhail Sergeyevich, you could have agreed to become the President for 15 years! By the year of 2000! - Why not? Why then? Then this post should not have been introduced. I would still be General Secretary, living in clover. That is a shameless attitude. Just like Napoleon! Elected First Consul for four years at first, then First Consul for lifetime... And off to the Island of Saint Helena for lifetime! Should I sit here? - Well, yes. Meanwhile, Boris Yeltsin, surrounded by his family was waiting for the first election results. Are you fine? - Yeah, perfect. -Sit down. My daily routine will certainly change. It has already. Because that constant pressure is gone. All of Russia on your shoulders... Every hour, every day... Problems are pressing, something has happened here and there, decisions have to be taken, thousands of papers have to be signed daily. Thousands! Thousands! - A constant pile lying there. Hell of a job. But now it's not pressing anymore. There's just the routine work left. Now the burden lies with Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. It is his duty now. I gave him a six-month head start on purpose, so that he could... So that after being elected he could already make use of the experience he had gained as Acting President. That is, the head of the state. That was the importance of my decision taken on 31 December 1999. They're still reproaching you, talking about a protégé or something. When you acted so decently, addressing the people and telling them, "Look at him!" so that people could evaluate his work. It was all done so democratically and honestly. His rating rose from two to fifty per cent. You know it. All due to his work, since he did not have any special electioneering advertising, he did not have any TV spots. He does business! He goes to the regions, deals with problems. He goes to Ivanovo - he deals with problems in the textile industry. He goes to Kuzbas - he deals with the miners' problems. He goes to Kamchatka or Sakhalin - he deals with the problems of Far East. Was it easy to take your 31 December decision? No, it was hard. But strange as it is, after that I felt better. Things I said to my folks... explained to the executives and the presidential administration, then to Vladimir Vladimirovich... I explained it to him four times... We had meetings. Eventually he understood that the idea was to transfer the power to him... as Acting President of Russia. Did you have to persuade him? He did not agree immediately. For the first time, we just got acquainted... Little Vanya! Little Vanya, come here! Exit poll summary for 7 PM. Putin - 51.2%, Zyuganov - 28.4%. Yavlinsky - 5.6%. Moscow: Putin - 44%. It's not clear yet. These are the exit poll results. - I know. People upon exit from the polling station. 8,000 people! It's unprecedented in Russia! 8,000 people interviewed upon the exit. There's no point in lying. The chance of an error is minor. It was tested during the Parliament election. Say good night. - Vanya, bye-bye! Vanya, going to bed so early? - We didn't sleep during the day. We went to vote. - Did you? Right, it's a serious business. I won't! - You won't go to bed? No! - Why? Fine! Stay with us. Would you like to stay with us? Vanya, sit with Grandpa. - Come to Grandma. Don't put fingers in your mouth. Vanya, your cheeks are just like apples! So, who do you have to vote for, Vanya? Tell Grandpa who you voted for. For Putin. For Putin! At last he said it aloud, for Putin! Lena, how is he calling Putin? He pronounces it so funnily. - Vanya, how do you call Putin? Again! - Say it aloud! He says, Vladimir Vladimirovich! Need a translator? - Do you need a translator? Do you know why he likes him? He likes his daughters! Would you like this candy? You didn't have tea. - They will. ORT Channel 2000. Vote results live. Election of the President of Russia - the most accurate and timely information. Live reports from "Election 2000" press centre. Interviews with candidates for presidency and heads of campaign offices. Expert commentaries on votes counting from the virtual studio. Only on our channel. - Preliminary voting results.... current voting results for President of the Russian Federation. Though I don't remember any mention of Putin's campaign office in press, it was the biggest headquarters with all the higher state officials engaged. Let's see what's happening in Moscow. Moscow - 46.71%. Like it was before. - Son of a bitch! We'll bear it in mind. St. Petersburg is fine. - And how many votes has Grisha got? Yavlinsky... 18.54%. - That's an outrage! Formally the campaign office was run by Dmitri Medvedev, the former subordinate of Putin from St. Petersburg period who was little known at the time. Hello? Hello? Damn! Talk to me. Your lift doesn't work. There's also Koryak Okrug in Far East... - All the reindeers have voted there. In fact, the campaign managers were experienced political technologists making use of the basis of administrative resources provided by the former and future federal ministers, heads of the presidential administration, leaders of media and sociological services. Where's the public opinion? Sasha! Tell the prognosis! 51%! - So what? Your data is good for nothing! This is Anatoly Chubais, Co-chairman of the Union of Right Forces. The right-wing democrats were in fact the only non-governmental parliamentary party that supported Putin in the election. When he became the head of the state, our election for the first time ceased to be a profanation and actually became a representation of the nation's will. It is Mikhail Gorbachev. Hello, Mikhail Sergeevich! Good evening! Mikhail Sergeevich, the question is, how did you spend this day? Well, today... Guys, turn off the camera! For Yeltsin this meeting with Gorbachev was unexpected, probably the first after 1991. Yeltsin practically ousted the President of the USSR and knew perfectly well what happens to ousted leaders in Russia. For all the years of Yeltsin's Presidency, Ex-President Gorbachev disappeared even from TV screens. Perhaps this is why Yeltsin himself thought seriously and in advance about a successor. I'm sick of it! How long are we going to listen to him? Mum! The election results are coming up! They won't announce it now, they may do it only at nine! Mum, sit down. The results are coming up. I have data which I have decided to share with our viewers and I will do it in a short while. What else is known, except that Putin is walking along the corridor? Putin walking along the corridor... Just like in the film about Stirlitz. What corridor? Gleb, are your people working here? What about Ksenia's team? - They went to the stations this morning... Maybe you could just go with Vladimir Vladimirovich... Press service ready... Hello, Gleb? Good evening. Tatyana Dyachenko calling. How many have already voted? 60 per cent? Moscow has let us down. So, can we already drink champagne? Taking very small sips... Alright, Gleb, very small sips. I'll tell Gena to get the champagne. Thanks! During the last years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, when his health caused a lot of issues the concept of "family" was established in the public consciousness. The success in state administration was attributed to family. Tatyana played an important role in this process. Tanya, can you live without politics? Or not anymore? Me? Sure, I can! Easy! I don't believe you. - I'm certainly worried... Therefore I have every right to acquaint you with the figures at the moment. Vladimir Putin - 51.2%. Gennady Zyuganov - 28.4%. We can see that the data are slightly diverging... Dad, are you happy? - This is my win. It's your win. - My win. Grigory Yavlinsky - 7 per cent. Now it is safe to say that the election has been effectuated. It is also safe to say... Now we can start drinking champagne taking very small sips. Pour a glass of champagne. - Right away. It was obvious that without Tatyana's participation the successor issue could not have been be effectuated. Very small sips... There are four of you? - No, there are many of us. There are many of us... Vitaly, stop filming. God! Is this all over, really? I can't believe it. Therefore, it was also her victory. Let's pour some. - In small sips... Now it's over. We have won. Really? - We have won. Hooray! The election has been effectuated in the first round. - As we were hoping. Though we'd have won anyway. All the same, first round or second. Here you are! Lena, we have won! Standing and to the bottom! I can bet - it will be this way! I've already made a bet with you. Dad, see? That's why you did what you thought you had to. You appointed a person and let one see if he fits for the job. They saw that he fits and voted for him. He wouldn't appoint a bad person. He chose among so many! Right! I picked out from 20 candidates within four months. Would you disclose the list? I stopped at him. Well, 20 candidates... No need to! I stopped at him and started working with him. Dad, the figures at the moment! It's 51.2 per cent! Gennady Zyuganov - 28.4% And this is just the GDP index. I would like to have Mikhail Gorbachev join to our chat as soon as possible. Oh God! Do you hear us? - Mikhail Sergeevich, again! Your opinion, please? - Why such a sad face? Why such a sad face? Dad, let us change the channel to NTV. - Fine. Cheers... to the election! Dad, I'm putting you through to Valentin Yumashev. You're not familiar with this model yet. It's like this. - Like this? Hello? I'm not familiar with this model yet. It is curious that after Putin's victory Valentin Yumashev was the first person whom Yeltsin spoke to over the phone. What win? Are you sure? Congratulations! It's great! It's great! Thanks. Thanks. I owe you one. And, as far as one can understand, Yeltsin thanks for something the former head of his administration. That's it, Mum, our Dad's finally free. Main thing, in the first round. Congratulations to you, too. What if you called Vladimir Vladimirovich? What if you called Vladimir Vladimirovich? - I'll call him. Let me do it. It's great! Misha, step aside. - Good evening. Congratulations on the first results of the elections! I'd like to talk to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin. Alright. I'll put down the receiver. Everything will be great. They'll call back. He must be back. He said he'd go to the campaign office. He must have returned. When he voted earlier today he said he'd go to the office at night. Then he will... Moscow - 44%... have voted for Putin. I said we had to gather Muscovites together. To gather them... Five per cent of Muscovites are covered, If there was a meeting with questions and answers in a big hall... Turn off that commercial! Change it to Channel 2! - It is Channel 2. Turn off the volume. Hello? Alright, fine. He has just left. They'll tell him and he'll call back. No, it's not clear yet. - But it is! How's that? - It is clear. Vladimir Vladimirovich has won. Looking ahead, I'll reveal to you that while we were there Boris Yeltsin did not receive Putin's return call. That's it. An hour and a half has passed. He's hanging out. - Hanging out... He's bossing about. Maybe they just said he's hanging out. What if he's sitting in the bath or... Sure, he is! - He has to get dressed... He has to take a bath, get dressed... - Get dressed at least... Take a shower... Let's not wait, let's say goodbye. - Let's do that. Okay. Thank you once again. - Yes. No, thanks to you. Boris Nikolaevich, thanks a lot. For free elections, for the freedom of Russia! For the freedom of the media! If Putin wins, the freedom of the media will be ensured by all means. Let's hope. - Thank you, Boris Nikolaevich. People are really curious. - They've all gathered here... We will provide the freedom of media. - Thanks. For nobody has yet appreciated that there is freedom in the country. No, you are not right. We do appreciate it. Thank you! Thank you. Take care! - Goodbye! By night, in Putin's campaign office all the key figures of the campaign had gathered. It’s important to introduce them to you: Mikhail Lesin, Russia's Minister of Press and the owner of the country's largest advertising agency. His ministry supervised, directly and indirectly, all the TV channels in Russia, the main media instrument of the current government. Gleb Pavlovsky, the former Soviet dissident, the chief political adviser of the Kremlin in the 2000s. On the twelfth year of Putin's rule, he went into political opposition. Ksenia Ponomaryova, the former head of Channel One Russia, deputy head of the campaign office. Shortly after the election of Putin she went into the opposition. In 2016, she died at the age of 54. Mikhail Kasyanov, Prime Minister of Russia during the first term of Putin. Later went into the opposition. He was persecuted and publicly humiliated after a TV show screened a hidden shooting of his intimate life. Vladislav Surkov. Having taken high positions from 2000 to 2013, was the main ideologist of the Kremlin. He was significantly demoted. After Putin's return for the third term. Valentin Yumashev. The former head of Yeltsin administration. He was the first who Yeltsin spoke to after the election results were announced. In 2002, Yumashev registered his marriage with Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana. Anatoly Chubais. One of the developers of economic reforms in Russia. Leader of the parliamentary democratic right faction. An associate of Boris Nemtsov. At the end of the first Putin's term, the democrats have never again entered the Russian parliament and went into opposition. How do you assess the preliminary results of the election? I believe that the experts who forecast the results... with all due respect... they seem to hit the target. Never in my worst nightmares could I have thought that I'd... Don't laugh, I'm serious. I could have never thought that I'd participate in the election because this seems to me absolutely unscrupulous. Or, seemed so far. Because you always have to promise something. And you have to promise as much... At least, you have to promise more than your rivals do. I have to say that... the way the electioneering went... and the way I managed to organize it... relieved me of the need to mislead vast masses of the population. They say that... I've made use in my electioneering of the present situation in Chechnya. I do not want to monopolize this topic. But I know what I did. I do not want to belittle my role, I am rather trying to evaluate it adequately. I know, if there was no consolidation of the entire Russian society, there would be not be that situation, which we are facing in the Caucasus. This is an issue... I'm ready to speak my mind... It benefits me in a way. I believe... I want to repeat it. I do not think I am entitled to monopolize this issue. I do not think I have the right to take any personal or unilateral decisions. Everyone invited to work in executive bodies of state authority must share the same opinion. They must strive for a common goal. I do believe there is only one option - to be honest. This press conference was great! These were some words! One should take down. One should take them down. Congratulations. Well? Now we should... - We should have a drink. Have a drink and off to bed! - We should have a drink. Who serves it? - They're on their way. So, who'll serve us a drink? We can serve ourselves. There's a meeting tomorrow at 10... I belong to the nation. I have to support my folks. Who do you belong to? - The nation. What is that thing? What do you mean, the nation? The nation are us, the electorate. Unfortunately, not all of us can gather. There are people sitting up and downstairs. There's no table like this there, they're sitting at their PCs. But the enthusiasm is really apparent. And I'll ask Dmitry Anatolyevich to thank everybody once again. The same goes for everyone who has gathered here because I know that... we used to scold you from time to time but, in fact, everything... was so psychologically grounded and organized so justly that gave an actual result. Everything that appeared on TV and on the street billboards, everything was developed step by step, little by little, with a view to the result we're currently approaching. Therefore, I want to thank you all and congratulate you. This is your success. "Hooray" already sounded husky. Because you're tired. Making an effort. Now a second wind will come. Thank you and see you tomorrow. Cheers! It is quite natural that the TV set in the campaign office broadcasted the NTV Channel. Just a year later the favourite channel of the state would be disbanded and nationalized. Give it to me, Tatyana Borisovna! I thank you... for the latest news. It seems we have linked with the studio of Nizhny Novgorod. Boris Efimovich, do you hear us now? Yes, I do! - Good night, Boris Efimovich! Even now, looking through the footage, against the background of the joyful hubbub in the winner's campaign office, I can hear the voice of Boris Nemtsov burst out from the TV. Today I turn up the volume. In order to either support or not support Putin. Remind me, what was your actual attitude towards Putin like? First, I belong to the Union of Right Forces. The Union of Right Forces took a decision - not a simple one - to support Putin, though me and Irina Khakamada, we abstained from voting. Second, I believed before, as I do now that two rounds of election would have benefitted the state. Between the first and the second round the favourite of the race could have in the first place made commitments to the nation and we would not find ourselves in the present state of uncertainty. We know nothing about the economic policy of Putin. He never intended to go public with it. Apparently it will appear only after the inauguration, which means that for the economy of the state and for citizens of the state, the situation is full of uncertainty. That is, we voted with our hearts, without knowing what would happen to us tomorrow. Tomorrow extended for many years. In the autumn of 2015, the body of millionaire Lesin with head injuries will be found in a modest hotel in Washington, DC. The pen goes to the girl as a keepsake. But in the winter of the same year Boris Nemtsov, who had joined the opposition to Putin, will be shot right by the walls of the Kremlin. Strangely, the majority of the ones who made efforts for Putin's triumph and were shoulder to shoulder with him at the moment of his election, today have either gone into opposition or were dismissed as Alexander Voloshin, the head of the presidential administration, or even his wife Lyudmila whom he divorced. The only person remaining with him, at least for now, is Dmitry Medvedyev. He was the one who became the President of Russia between Putin's second and third term. Vladimir Putin came into power as a red-hot knife in butter. And the state lurked in submissive readiness to follow its new leader. The state had not yet heard of the concept of power vertical, but subjugation of each and all, from the Parliament to business, to one single command centre was going into high gear. Even Khodorkovsky wasn’t imprisoned yet and NTV still dared to criticize the President as, for example, during the accident on the submarine "Kursk". But it was already becoming quite clear that it is better not to argue with the President. The ghost of the past appeared again and again, trying to make up for what was lost in the present. And soon, the President of Russia Vladimir Putin will call the collapse of the Soviet Empire the largest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century. Meanwhile, I went on shooting my film, which was now about the elected President, followed by a film about the Kremlin life. It seemed that nothing changed radically during the first year of Putin's presidency. The only changes were in details and nuances, having no significance at the first glance. For example, the President signed a federal law to return the army its banner of victory over fascism. Well, what banner could they hoist above the Reichstag in 1945? Of course, the red Soviet flag with the star, the sickle and the hammer. And despite the fact that the tricolour was still the national flag, the Presidential Kremlin Regiment swore allegiance to the red flag of our Soviet homeland. We remember with a sense of accomplishment the time when young recruits joined the ranks of the Presidential Regiment. Naturally, with the new President a new inner circle appeared in the Kremlin. Igor Sechin, the administration official, who knew Putin from St. Petersburg, became one of the main figures of this circle. It was Sechin who was credited with the major role in submitting business to the will of the President, and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The gigantic battle at Kursk changed the balance of forces in Europe. They could not ward off the Anglo-Americans invasion with their own forces. Every soldier and every officer who deserts the army must be shot! Clemenceau in 1917 ordered every tenth soldier out of any rebelling unit to be shot. But you cannot shoot everyone, my Führer! Duce, to fulfill our mission, you must stand above human suffering! As a result of my work an official film appeared, aired on the Russian State TV on the 1st anniversary of Putin's presidency. At that time it was shown in many countries of the world. Even today I'm not ashamed of it. Moreover, the film seems to have matured and discloses much of what was left unnoticed before. However, I am still being asked if anything was left behind the scenes. It was. For example, this. You've turned on your camera again. - Sure, I have. So, I'd like to tell... As regards the way people live... Recently I was in Lensk... and some woman... not elderly yet... but also not young... She said, "Give us back our old life. The way it was 20 years ago." What'd you tell her? It is impossible to get back anything. You cannot get back either your youth or bygone days. Moreover, if we try to return to the past, we will definitely destroy everything. But to make sure that people weren’t doing worse than before but better - this is something we can do. This is such a candid conversation - I cannot help but ask. Why did you restore the Soviet anthem? This is connected with what I told you before. It is necessary to restore the citizens' confidence in the Establishment. That woman in Lensk who said we had to give her back the former life the way it had been twenty years ago... People should feel that they are not deprived of everything. And if... She has to grow old but we have to live. We do have to live, that's right. But why do you think we have to live with that music rather than with this? Why can't we, listening to the anthem written by Alexandrov, think about the victory in WWII rather than the Gulag? Why should we necessarily associate this music with the worst aspects of life during the Soviet period? In that conversation about the anthem, I tried to find out from Putin why the state should at all return to the past, which in the contemporary Russia has not yet received its historical evaluation. I told you it would hardly be possible to restore things... But it was really important to sense... that the majority of the population has a certain nostalgia... You must not deprive people of everything. This is the moral aspect. This is what I think about when I remember my parents. This is a part of their life. Should we dump it all in the scrap heap of history? As if they hadn't lived at all? It would be very cruel towards our parents. At least for that reason! This is a good version - with church bells! Right? Plus, a troubled trumpet... And you have to hold out till the end. So that it stands out against the orchestra. It'd be great! Yes, very well. I told you - the back should straighten up. Even for the lay in music. The orchestra under supervision of the film director Nikita Mikhalkov and his father, the lyricist of two Soviet anthems, was working hard to record the former Soviet and present Russian anthem in the new, third edition, by Mikhalkov Sr. "So it was, so it is..." - We're ready. "So it was, so it is, and so it always will be!" It should go fluently. The choir! Would you stand up, please? At least the first verse! Let's start from the beginning. Once again! You know... There was a quite a rush with the lyrics. They pestered me with the lyrics... One version, another version... For Stalin the anthem was recorded performed on the bells of the Dormition Cathedral. Completely! When did we record it? A hundred years ago. - Why a hundred? When did you change Stalin for Lenin? Which year was it? - It was in the 1970s... 1960s? - 1970s... I think the church bells should give the feel that distinguishes the Russian anthem from any other in the world. Be glorious, our country! We are proud of you! Be glorious, our country! A pause! We are proud of... There was no accent in the recitative! An unexpected morning call from the Kremlin made me return to the President's office. Hello! It's you again with your pussycam. Be careful, the camera is on. I wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk. Strictly speaking, I thought I could take the liberty to talk about it. I do not know your goals and I won't interfere in the creative process. You'll make it the way you see fit. I'm not trying to impose anything on you. I just want to state my point of view and you'll decide if you use it or not. As to our conversation about the anthem... Why have we returned to the old melody by Alexandrov? Many don't understand that. Unfortunately. And it's strange that there is such a misunderstanding. I do not know how I managed to convey this yesterday, in the conditions of a more or less formal conversation. Let's say, the restoration of the anthem with the Soviet melody... gives additional bonuses to a person involved in politics from the point of view of increasing the rating... or increasing public confidence. This is necessary in order to achieve something. Relying on this trust of the population. Although, you can argue about the ways in which to make it happen and choose the best option. How do you imagine a dispute with the authorities? A dispute with the President? - Very simple! There are instruments of democracy. Very many people have signed against the anthem, being the conscience of the nation. This conscience does not... feel for the tragedy that the people are going through! It was signed by people who do feel for and who voted for you! You do understand, whenever I have to take certain decisions some people will always think that these actions are wrong. Including the ones who voted for me. I believe I have to explain to all, absolutely all the motives of my acts. And I must act as I deem necessary. So, you are not afraid of losing some of that trust, by taking tough decisions? In my opinion, it is obvious that decisions should be taken in the interests of the state, regardless of whether they cause a positive or a negative reaction. One must understand that. One can agree or disagree but one must understand that. If you think about it. See, you're already hesitating! - No, I'm not. Do you want me to say that I am hesitating? - No, I don't. But this is the issue that could have been... that could have been put off for now. Like the issue with Lenin in the Mausoleum. The issue of the Labour Code could have also been put off. No, it couldn't have! - It is your opinion! But others think that the land issue could have been put off. There's no need to introduce a new Land Code. There are such people! Do you think they are less than those who don't want to have the old anthem back? Politics is the art of possibility, the art of possible compromises, isn't it? Yes, it is, although... This is a good phrase that you can use whenever... whenever you need to fill a pause. But you said it was a compromise. Yes, it is a compromise to a certain extent. But it's still... It certainly appears like a compromise. Nevertheless, these are meaningful actions to achieve... to achieve this state in which... relying on which... you can solve substantive tasks in reconstruction of the state and modernization of the economy. I cannot disagree with this argument. You see? We are already bringing together our positions! I cannot disagree only with this argument. We are bringing together our positions. And you say - impossible to persuade you. I don't know why Putin needed to persuade me of his decision when it was already impossible to restore the anthem. Wasn't there anyone left around to disagree with him? Is it fine that you haven't persuaded everyone of the correctness of this decision? You cannot persuade everyone. Unfortunately. It's impossible! 140 million! You cannot discuss things with everyone in person! Though it seems to me I'd be able to if I started talking to everyone in person. Only it's impossible! No offence, but I'm not going to share your opinion as regards the anthem. You should. On 31 December 2000, exactly a year had passed since the resignation of Boris Yeltsin and the appointment of Vladimir Putin as his successor. The most touching event of last year was Yeltsin's appearance on 31 December. Nobody had spoken to the Russians like that before. Today, on the last day of the outgoing century... God, it's a pity, after all! I am resigning. I want to ask you for forgiveness. Before Yeltsin, nobody had taken advantage of the occasion so skillfully. So, on the New Year's Eve, ten minutes before midnight, Russian citizens are congratulated by another person. On 31 December 1999, Russia’s first president decided to resign. He has asked me to address the nation. But this is the beginning of a completely different story. But this is the footage that was already shot today. The successor got his sea legs quickly enough, distancing himself more and more from his creator. Miracles happen on the New Year's Eve... hair conditioner for rinsing and for volumizing... we will not only recall of the most important events of those twelve turbulent months of 2000 in Russia but also recount how they changed the lives of those involved. First of all, we'll cover this year's most striking and even tragic moments. During the year after his resignation for Boris Yeltsin the notion of "family" recovered its original meaning. It's three minutes to midnight. Let's drink to the outgoing year! By the way, this is the first year that was more or less peaceful. There is none of this yearning of the previous ten years left, "Thank God that it's over!" Dear relatives, dear friends! Tonight... we are ringing out the old year and ringing in the new year. I am sure that for this country the upcoming year will be better than this one. It will be better! And yet we're ringing in... or rather ringing out the old year with certain... sadness. For it actually was... it was hard, Little Vanya. Little Vanya does not care yet. - It was hard but it was there! We bore it on our shoulders! It is my wish that in the bosom of our family, among the relatives, the unity and solidarity grew stronger. Although, I cannot complain. Everything is fine here, we do not have any... Alright, Little Vanya, you speak and I will listen. He is ringing out the old year. In a word... Happy New Year's Eve! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy upcoming year! - Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Wherever you look... It's always him. - ...mediocrity/ Did they restore the anthem without your knowledge? Even the new lyrics did not save it? It's reddish! This word, "reddish," in particular, having absorbed all the bitterness of the reanimation of the Soviet past, became for me a sign of farewells. Yeltsin died on the seventh year of Vladimir Putin's presidency. Does the President have a say over many things in this country? Sure, the head of the state has a say over many things in this state. Certain functions of the President are established by the law. They are very comprehensive and presidential powers might become determinant in order to perform these functions correctly. As a rule, as to things I have been planning, I have basically managed to meet the goals that I had set for myself. What is your attitude toward all-embracing unity of the nation under the guidance of the wise, visionary and just Vladimir Putin? I can sense a slight irony in your question. Everything we used to call extremities, in this sense, certainly do not help but rather cause harm. Therefore, any busts, monuments and other elements of autocracy, which have migrated to our time from the past, cannot please but are very difficult to fight against. Shall we go? - Yes. I admit, despite the fact that this was only the first year of Putin's rule, all my questions were already bringing on the issue of succession of power, imperial ambitions, and autocracy. Although, formally there was no special reason for this. And if you listened and believed in what Putin said then, there should have been no worry whatsoever about the future of Russia. Getting out of the car and buying a mug of beer, as you probably can guess, is quite difficult. Because you're always on the move with a lot of people around you. So, there is a problem with the traffic. If I get out of the car and start drinking beer, thousands or hundreds will wait for the motorcade to pass and nothing good will come of it. This is just the simplest example of everything. But would you like that? Yes, I would. I do believe that the day will come when I'll be able to return to a normal life. I do believe that someday I'll have a future as a private citizen, that I'll be engaged in some other activity and will live the life of a normal person. Well, these are wonderful words. They foster... certain optimism... That's right, it's... I do not sense any irony in what you say. And I'll tell you why. It is very important. With this, by the way, we are returning to your question if stepping in the shoes of a monarch would not be better. First of all, the life of a monarch is quite complicated. I have met monarchs quite often during the recent year in various parts of the world, during official visits. And I can say that their fate does not inspire me. At least I would not like to repeat anything like that. Their life is hard; it is full of restrictions. People do not belong to themselves; and that is their destiny. And that is forever. In this respect... the life of an elected head of the state is better since it gives a chance to prove yourself in the greatest deed, in service to the Motherland, with the maximum effort. But at the same time, it provides an opportunity of living a normal life after having performed your official duties, after the end of your term. Though, you are always being reminded that your term will end one day and you will have to, first of all, live a life of a normal person and, as they used to say some time ago, the way that you wouldn't be ashamed for the years you had lived. And so that you were able, in your new position, to address people boldly. Without casting down your eyes. And one more thing is very important. It is necessary to understand that you will live as a normal citizen and everything you do with the state and the society today you will have to face in a few years as an ordinary citizen. It is a good thing to remember before taking a decision. Rather than yielding to monarchical ambitions when taking a decision. Perhaps I'll put the camera down and say it behind the scenes. If you do exactly as you are saying now, this will become a pledge of a worthy future both for the country and you personally. Right. But, as I'm telling you, I've happened to be sitting and thinking, racking my brain about the way it should be, "Wait! Think about how your children will live, how the children of your friends and relatives will live, and how you will live - what kind of country it will be!" This is a serious issue, which is most probably the essence of the advantages provided by democracy. That is one of the reasons why democracy and democracies are more resilient and effective. No idea what to say in this case... Let's keep our fingers crossed? Thumbs up. Let's go and exercise? - Let's go. Oleg, we're going to the gym. Konni! Konni, look at me! Konni! That's it! Sit! Behave! Goodbye. - Let's go. Heel! Heel! Come on, heel! Putin still rules in Russia. Much has happened during the years of his administration. The end of the war in Chechnya and the beginning of the Chechen wars in Moscow. The Olympics and doping. Crimea and the war in Ukraine. The rising from the knees and getting kicked out of G8. Moreover, there was emigration, imprisonments and the deaths of those who tried to speak out against Putin personally. There was also the price I had to pay for assuming naively that I was just a witness. But life proved that tacit consent turns witnesses into accomplices. So we all voluntarily turned out to be hostages of the person who was leading us towards the glorious future, reminiscent so much of the dark past.
