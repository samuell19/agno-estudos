Kazue! Why did you escape? I want to die! Let's go back to the hospital. It's no use. I drank poison. Kazue! Why did you break in? Do you know who I am? Yes. Hiroshi of the Tachibana Gang. I was asked to deliver this to you. What is it? Open it, and you'll see. It's your baby. What did you say? Kazue bore it. She did? She escaped from the hospital and had it on the beach. She didn't want your child, so she tried to kill herself by drinking poison. But she went into labour and had a miscarriage. And then she died. Anything to say? Nothing? At least hold a funeral for your child. Bye. You just let her go? Cheers! - Who's afraid of a gang? - Right! Hello again. Welcome. - Thank you for the delivery. - Not at all. - Come out. - Sure. A fight? I'm holding my child's funeral. You talk like a dad. Rica, I'm unarmed. A duel. Sure. Stay back. You bitch. Get up! Don't mess with me! Damn it! Stay back! The cops! Hold it! What are you doing! Let me go! What! He's dead! RICA The Korean War had begun The soldiers going to the front were sex-hungry Is it you, Kayo? So I couldn't live with my Aunt. Kayo, don't cry any more. What's done is done. You can stay here with me. Why... Why did I get pregnant? I don't want a baby! I don't want a baby! Grandma! - See you! - Bye! More. More. Can you pick up the ball for us? What did you do? Stupid! You're stupid! Welcome home. You're wet. Change your clothes or you'll get cold. Where's Mum? At the beauty parlour. I'm making curry for you. I hate curry. Once you eat my curry, you'll like it. You're a big girl now. Stop it. Sorry, I'm late. The parlour was crowded. Are you home, Rica? Rica, what's the matter? Rica! Rica! Rica! Damn him! Rica! I'll kill him! What are you doing? Mom! Your man is a beast! Hey, what is it? Good boy. I think she's alone. Let me go talk to her. Looking for fun, chicken? Tokyo Reform School Come out! Rica Aoki, 17. What does your mother do? A concubine. What? A mistress. I see. My pop's a GI and I don't know who he is. You weren't asked. I want you to serve God and atone for your sins in this school. If you start doing good things, he'll forgive whatever you've done. Listen, everybody. This is Rica Aoki, your new friend. Greet them. Please turn around. Breathe in. Yes. You're healthy. Doctor. Yes? Can rape cause pregnancy? It's possible. Women are the same as animals. They need no love to have kids. Maybe so... But I guess you can also say that's the mystery of life. White, black, yellow... mystery, indeed! I'm the boss here. My name is Reiko. People call me Dragon God. Beautiful! Didn't it hurt? I cried for three nights. I couldn't leave my bed. There's no tattoo like this in Yokohama. A national treasure. Then why don't you take this? Stop it! Hello. Nice day, isn't it? "The Tachibana gangsters beat us." "They raped our girls and took them away." Rica, I challenge you. Wait in the garden. All right. You're going to escape again? No. I can't sleep. I'm having some exercise. Liar! You're trying to escape, aren't you? Junko? Rica! What happened after I left? What happened to your legs? I ran through the field. Hungry? Tell me what the gangsters did. They raped us. Could you escape? I bit it hard. "It"? He screamed in pain. That would work. When I went back, everyone was gone. I thought they'd come back in the morning, but they didn't. They are gone. Tachibana had sold them. To Hong Kong? Vietnam. To feed the hungry GIs. Is it too late? Let's go, Junko. I heard about you... a fresh Amerasian. Glad to see you. I'm Mr Z. We're going to ship the cargo tonight. You're in time. There are seven. You need money to stop the shipment. How much? You can be my special wife. How much? You can be my fourth wife. How much? Three million. By what time? Six. See you at six. You're nice. I want to sleep with you. I don't see strangers. But she insists. Who is it? She said you know. What for? I want money. I didn't say you could come in. That's fine. Leave us alone. You may go. Yes, sir. Rica! I need three million. I don't have it. All right. Then I'll have to ask your wife. Rica, don't threaten me. You have a beautiful wife and three children. One is in high school, one is in junior high and the other one is in kindergarten. Old man. Can you refuse? Who the hell raped me? Can I tell your wife? Hurry! Hey! Who the hell are you? I don't know what's going on, but three men against one girl. I can't just sit still. Bastard! Run away. Whoever you are, thanks. But only ten minutes! I said six. The cargo was already loaded. We waited till six. When it was time, we weighed anchor. The whistle is a signal. One of those freighters out there... it will move soon. The Vietnamese War. And you smuggle girls to feed the soldiers. You are a war criminal. I'm a merchant. I don't know what the cargo is. Somebody asked me to buy it. I can sell it for a lot of money. You mean Tachibana? I can't tell you. Good merchants keep silent. - Merchant of death! - Shut up! Be careful what you say. Don't mess with us, or you'll die. I like you. Someday I will lay you. Ask her to leave. Yes, sir. The ship's leaving. - Tetsu did it? - Yes. I'm sure it was him. That bastard, I've been wanting to get rid of him. Keep quiet. Akemi. We want this girl's lover. We're going to borrow her. Change. Rica, terrible! Sorry, but stay like that for a while. Till Tetsu, your lover, shows up. He'll come to rescue you. Then we'll get him and beat him up. That's all we want. Are we unfair? Nothing's fair in this world. I get rid of a nuisance no matter what. That's my way. He's late. Tetsu isn't the kind of guy who would run away, is he? I want to talk to Boss Tachibana. My name is Rica. Please sit down. I wanted to meet you. The same to you. To say thank you. The same to you. You killed one of my boys Hiroshi. One of my girls Kazue was cheated by him... ...and she got pregnant and killed herself. We're even then. No. While I was away, seven of our girls disappeared. I'm sorry to hear that. Were they cheated by bad guys, too? Maybe they were packed and sent to Vietnam. Vietnam, huh? I'll question you about that later. I came here for something else. Give Akemi back. I will give her back to Tetsu. I can't let him come here. I owe him. I won't let him die, even if it may cost my life. Rica, you've got guts. I'm in love with you. No, thanks. I'll compromise. Here is the condition. Dance nude in my night club. If you accept, I'll forget about Tetsu. I can't dance. You can learn. The point is walk naked among the tables. Rica, I found your mother. - Mom? - Yes. I saw her working here. Her name is Kayo Aoki. Oh, right here. She works here as a scrubwoman. For a month. Where is she now? She should be at the food corner in the basement. Be careful. Are you okay? Here. Excuse me, where is the woman named Aoki? She is over there. Come on. What? That's a top-secret document on the reclamation of the waterfront plan. Why did you go to the store? My wife asked me to buy some dried fish. They have a bargain sale in the department store. She's ill, so... You went there to buy dried fish during working hours. You're entirely responsible for this! Remember it's top secret. Of course. Don't worry. All we want to know is the place for reclamation. Can I get the reward now? Yes, I have it here. What is it? Both Mr. Yoshikawa and his wife committed suicide. - Both died? - Yes. The policemen are inside. Mr. Yoshikawa who just died... we saw him in the department store today. When we were going down the stairs... I remember. He died after that. The guy had his bag... I think he belongs to Tachibana. I've seen him before. What? Rica saw it? She caught my eyes. I'm sure she saw it. Too bad. I wanted to make her mine. Should we kill her? We have to. Rica, I want to talk. Me too. Let's go somewhere we can be alone. - What do you want? - Your life. Tachibana's order? Yes. I'm sorry. If you kill me, you won't be able to make love to me. That's right. Then why do you want to kill me? Why? You're a witness. Is it because I saw you stealing the document from the man? Yes. What was it? I don't know. I'm a pickpocket. I'm honest with you. Be honest with me. A reclamation plan. You want to buy up the land first? Yeah, a government official's in cahoots with us. Bastards! Rica! You confessed. Rica! This? Damn you! Boss, it's the pickpocket's hand. Take it. Damn you! Two innocent people died for you. Throw her in the sea. We killed Rica. I know, Boss. You'd better take to the road. I'm useless now. A pickpocket is finished when he loses his hand. How much will you get if you buy up the land? Don't get smart. Shut up and leave the city. The money's ready. It's genuine, Sabu. Goodbye, Boss. Go to hell! Boss. Rica! I came to thank you. Call 110. Call the cops. God always extends a helping hand to you. Don't fail to reform yourself this time, okay? So you killed Boss Tachibana? He was scum. He deserved death. But that doesn't settle all the problems. We were punished because you escaped. I apologize. You became a lamb. I can't fight this way. I'm not going to stay here long. It's smart to be quiet now. Give me a ride. I'm chased by some bad guys. Please take me to town. Where are you going? We got three-days labour and no rations because of you! You'll pay for this! Fire! Somebody help! Fire! Somebody help! Dr. Numata! Fire! Thanks to God, half of the building was saved. Eleven girls escaped, but thirty nine stayed. We can't take care of all of them. I'll ask other schools to share the burden. Dr. Numata, I'm sorry, but will you help us? Yes. Will you take Rica and Tokiko to Komyo School tomorrow? Certainly. And will you let them stay at your place tonight? All right. I heard the knife that killed the warden was Rica's. I heard it was Reiko's. Reiko escaped, didn't she? Who set the fire? Devils! Only death can change them! I heard some people say Rica's knife missed the target and killed the warden. That's not true. Reiko threw it. Doctor, that's right. I guess you know best about it. I won't lie to you. I wonder. I never will! Who set the fire? I don't know. Excuse me. Are you there? You have guests? It's okay. They're from the school. You had a fire. You must be shocked. I saw it in the newspaper and hurried here. This is Miss Kyoko Morikawa. Your fiancee? Yes. Nice to meet you. Reiko threw the knife. We'll find out when she gets back. She won't. I'll prove it. I'll bring her back! Forget it, Rica. Girls shouldn't play with knives. I'm hungry. Let's eat lunch. You're back! - I'm hungry. - Bust out? Yeah. Seen Reiko? No. - Where's Reiko? - Isn't she at the reform school? CHINATOWN Who are you? What do you want? This is my room. The girl in here is my friend. Not now. They're making love. You rent the room? Yes. 1000 yen. Will you be my customer? Can I rent it now? It's about time. Who is it? Me. Time's up. Where's your man? He's coming. Hanako, what are you doing? You know how you were born, don't you? Your mother had you the same way. He's going to Vietnam tonight. Yes. I'm going to Vietnam. He doesn't want to go. But he's forced to. MP's are here! The window. No good. Jimmy. Jimmy. We met three days ago. I love him. He's going to war. He'll die. - Will you let me stay here tonight? - He's here. What? The black man's here. Let go of me! He insists on seeing you. Aoki! Hi. - It's been a while. - Yes. Fine? Yes. I heard you were sent to the reform school? I escaped. You seen Reiko? "Dragon God" Reiko? I'm looking for her. I think I saw her in the street yesterday. Can I stay with you tonight? I'm not alone. With Akemi? She went to Guam to work. Then who? I got four men. Don't worry. She's my friend. Deserters. They'll be gone tomorrow. They've been here for three days. The ship for Vietnam just left. They were supposed to be on that. MP's are after them, so they have to stay here. Hungry? No. Why did Akemi go to Guam to work? To tell you the truth, she didn't. She disappeared. Why? Your pals disappeared too. Vietnam? It wasn't Tachibana who did it, it was the Osaka Gang. Is Akemi a victim? I'm trying to get proof, but I have nothing on them. I'll avenge her. Excuse me. - I was asked to give you this. - By who? Read it. "Meet me at the landfill at ten. Reiko" I'm wrongly accused of murder. I want you to come with me, Reiko. That won't be necessary. We will settle matters here. You've got some help for the duel? Stay back, buddies. Damn, they are the Osaka Gang. Rica. Reiko. Stop it! Hey! Who the hell are you? Fuck off. Leave him alone. What the hell... Bastard! Mum! Rica! You are Rica! Rica! Rica! Hello, sir. Come in. Hello. I'm Rica Aoki. I'm Tabuchi of the Osaka Gang. Please. I heard a lot about you. You're rising to fame. Could you do me a favour? What is it? Could you give me Reiko. Oh, the girl who escaped from the reform school? She isn't here. She's in a house in Chinatown. I have some business to settle with her. Will you help me fight with her somewhere, Boss? All right. I like you. You have a lot of guts. I will arrange your duel. She's nice. Beautiful. She's got sexual charms. It's a pity to feed her to the GIs. Get in. Rica, now we can fight without disturbance. I asked the boss of the Osaka Gang to give us this chance to fight. Ready? Come on. Enough. You don't need to get hurt anymore. What the hell is going on? Nice, aren't they? Very. Boss, what's all this? I'll leave it to you. Damn it! You deceived us! Beat them! Silence! Strip them if they resist! You asked for it. You bastards! Be careful with them. They're our goods. The others? Somewhere in this building. You have a big butt. I don't know how it got big. Are you all right? I'm okay. We will dive here. Hold on to me. Ready? Strip and wrap a blanket. Help me. Are you hungry? No. I'm cold. You'll be warm soon. Hold me. I hold you? And warm me. Not Dr. Numata? Now I want you. I'd like to see Mr. Hirose. And your name? My name is Rica Aoki. He has a guest. He's busy. Please see him at his office. You don't understand. What are you doing? - You have a guest, huh? - What do you want? How dare you sell Japanese girls to Vietnam? Be quiet. - Anything wrong? - Nothing. Just business. Don't worry, just leave us alone. Make a right turn. Where to? There. Somebody you know is waiting for you. Mom, there's a guest for you. Your sweetheart. Mr. Hirose! You loved her. Why do you run away? I'll give you money. How much? You deserted her. She's a whore for tramps now. And a dope addict, crazy from VD. Take her to your happy peaceful home. Let me go home today. I'll give you whatever you want. Kiss her goodbye. But... Mom, you used to sleep with him. Kiss him. Mr. Hirose. - You! - Mr. Hirose. Get off me. Mr. Hirose. Damn it. Let me go. Let me go. Why doesn't Mr. Hirose show up? I expected to see him in my office at five. But there was no contact from him. I called his home. Apparently he had gone out with his guest. It's not serious. We have this gentleman. The deal is finished. So no trouble. I don't care about anything since... ...the cargo has been loaded and I've received payment. I have Mr. Hirose's money. I brought it here. Reiko! Rica! Hurry! I pissed in here. What's wrong? Somebody, come here! You bastard. Damn it! Jump overboard. Our boat's waiting. Tetsu. Tetsu. Tetsu! Tetsu. Rica. Reiko. Just my luck. Dr. Numata! Congratulations. Where to, Rica? Courage, Rica!
