Do you want the best? From the best? Look no further than Waters Cove. The future shopping, dining, and entertainment destination for a brand-new Angel Falls. My Angel Falls. Hey, you! And remember, there's only one name that you can trust... Waters Corp. I'm the best, so the rest. Tell 'em Henry sent ya. Merry Christmas! Whoo! You get me! You get me! Really! It's so good to see all of you on this blessed day. A little cold. All of your smiling, beautiful faces, they all keep me warm all year 'round, I'll tell you that. But we're here for one thing. I know you know what it is. - Should we do it? - Yeah! Angel Falls, I give you... Christmas! Looks like we'll make it to our car this year without Mr. Waters making Dad do some work. Hey. David Carruthers, is that you? - Jinxed it. - Look it! All the Carruthers are here! Hey, great job with the tree. Thank you! - What did you think? - God. Is that Mr. Waters' little brother Buck taking selfies? He started an OnlyFans last week. I swear. Did you see the commercial, Judy? - My new one? - No. Not yet. You got to check it out. It's playing regionally thanks to David's marketing genius. Yeah, I directed that bad boy. - I remember, Buck. - Ha, I know. I kicked you off the set. Yeah, okay, okay. That's what I remember. Hey, Buck. You remember me? Jimmy Carruthers. You were my peewee football coach. Yo, yo, yo, TikTok. Um... if you ever wanted to see my dick, Merry Christmas to you. It's hard to fit it under the tree. Please shoot me. David, we still got to get Roger Evans. He won't sign those papers. Roger's house is the last thing standing in the way. Standing in the way of what? Well, this is exciting. Phase Four for the new Angel Falls. It's gonna be your future favorite shopping, dining, and lifestyle destination. LA's got The Grove. We're gonna have Waters Cove. Can't believe you didn't tell her about this! Didn't the town council decide his house is an historic landmark? Ma'am, they almost did. See, I'm a little bit more persuasive than my father ever was. He was so driven by sentiment. Let's go, Dave. We'll talk about it on the way. Dad, it's Christmas Eve. Just keep my meal warm. I won't be long. You have a microwave? You can heat up the food afterwards. - It'll be fine. - I love the microwave. Yeah, she cooks all the meals in the microwave. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Come on. It's okay, Mom. This happens every Christmas. You ought to be used to it by now. Come on. Let's go home. Henry Waters, Prince of Angel Falls, strikes again. Here we go, Roger. You got the pen? All ready to go. Let me just twist it. Ready to go for you. Mr. Evans, we know you're carrying a lot of debt, and you could use the money. So, I think it's a really great idea to sign. You're a good man, David. But my family's lived here for generations. My granddaughter will own it next. I'm not signing. When your dad died a few years ago, Henry, he should have left the business to David. But I'm his son. David was more of a son to him than you ever were. Look, Roger. I know you and your family, you used to be the gold standard around here. Especially at Christmas time. You donated those trees, year after year. But that was in the past. 'Cause I'm here now. So, I want you to take a look around your town... If you're able to walk outside on your own. And you will see that I'm the person this town needs to move us on into the future. By kicking them from their storefronts and their homes? The people of this town are its future, Henry. They want to live. To work and be happy. And that's it. Your father knew that. Why do you want to take that away from them? Why do you want to turn them into your drones? Roger, you don't know anything about my father. So why don't we leave him out of this, yeah? It's your last chance. Sign the papers. No. You okay, Grandpa? Hi, Cara. Just a little Christmas business. You off to the party? Yeah. Unless you need me to stay? No, no, you go on. Have fun. Love you, Grandpa. Good to see you, Mr. Carruthers. Great to see you, Cara. We'll see you tomorrow night for dinner? Great. Have fun at the party. Hey, Cara. You be safe now. For my gay son! A rainbow! Ornament. Isn't it cute? Just like you. You're gonna have to hang that on every Christmas tree for the rest of her life. Alright, alright. Everyone cool your tits. - We're here. - Where have you been, sis? Karen's parents. We were just having another lovely Christmas Eve dinner. We explained we are, in fact, married and not roommates. What can I say? My parents aren't exactly marching at Pride any time soon. Winnie, Cara's waiting outside. Coming, Jimmy? I have to do my hair. Does this help? No. - Bye, Mom! - Okay. Don't do anything I wouldn't do! No! Get fucked up! Gale! Judy! My... Whoo! Hey! - No Eddie? - He's meeting us there. Robbie? Same. Hey, can you drive home later? I need to get drunk. Of course. What happened? Henry Waters. That spray-tan prick wants to own this whole town. Apparently, my family home is the last thing standing in his way. Sleep over tonight. Tell your grandpa to be over for Christmas breakfast. Carruthers-Evans Christmas day special. Done and done. Fuck Henry Waters. Yeah, totally. "F" that guy. Just say "fuck", Winnie... I can't! - Got it. - Cute! Go away, Henry. I told you no. Henry, I told you... Fuck, yeah! Christmas! Darla's here. Win, take a photo! Get my good side. So cute! Heck, yeah! These are yearbook-ready. Yeah, you finally made editor. One more brag for your college applications. I'm surprised you're here, Darla. I thought you were grounded tonight. Yep. Well, my mom and dad went to visit my sister. I have the house to myself. House to yourself? You gonna have anyone over? Obviously. It's like the after-party after-party. After this party. Hi. Ew, no. Don't talk to Weirdo. Weirdo looks so stalkerish over there. - Harsh, Darla. - Hardly. She knows that everyone calls her that. Right, Weirdo? Winnie, babe. Tell your brother I keep saving his ass over and over again. - Hey. - Football team never gets the rest of the credit when we make the quarterback look good. Jimmy is the Carruthers family golden child, Robbie. Ouch, Winnie. Just teasing. Good. Besides, you've got New York and a future to look forward to. As for me, after graduation, I'll probably be coaching JV football in the fall. For now, there is a brooding, mysterious, artistic type that requires... my attention. Later, virgins. Speak for yourself. Well, I'm out. Need more. I'll join you. Alright. Babe, want anything? No, I'm good. Thanks, though. I'm gonna go see what Eddie's up to. You go do that. Fuck. You're a good kisser. Someone's watching us. Hey, let's... let's get out of here, yeah? The lights are so pretty. They should keep them up all year. Here? This is perfect. Kiss me. Ew. What did you eat? Help me! Somebody please help me! He's after me! Winnie, come back! Come on. We got to go. Okay. No! Cara, no! No! No! No! No, no, no. No, you're... you're not dead. Please. Please, wake up. Please. Come on. Get up. Get up, come on! Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Mr. Waters? Angel Falls is renewed. And full of life! Our community is stronger than ever. Hey, Chad! Have a great day Everyone has a smile. And we give free smiles with every home purchase from Carruthers Family Realty. Because, with us, you don't just get a house. You get a home! Can't believe that was the best take. Not another Christmas. Let's go, Winnie. We're gonna be late! Jimmy! Did you hear from NYU? Not yet. You forgot your camera. No, I didn't. Hey, you guys. Do you smell that? It's Christmas. Everyone! You killed my brother. Your family, they're, um... they're really thriving 'cause of what you did. The whole town's happy he's dead. That night still haunts me, Buck. Every day I'm sorry. I should fucking end you. I should fucking end you 'cause of what you did. Look outside. It's snowing. My gosh. Looks like everybody got their wish. They sure did. Okay, and one for Winnie. I love this tradition of opening one gift on Christmas Eve. Come on, open it. I want to see! Workout gear? Pink! But you love pink. Good job, David! Nobody had that color. David, no, no, no. The dick got me a scale. We can hear you guys whispering. What's the matter? You never give women gifts related to their bodies. It's never okay. Even if it's from your own dad. Especially if it's from your own dad. Come on. It's fun. It's got your initial on it. Come on. Just go put it on. Judy, maybe she just tries it on later. Winnie. Come on, just go put it on. For us. Please. Okay. Alright! Charades? Jesus Christmas! Here you go, Mom and Dad. Where did everyone go? Well, your brother got a new truck. What? Are you kidding?! My God! This is actually insane! My business partner needs to drive in style. Get in! Are you fucking kidding me? - Winnie, language! - What's the problem? Winnie, it's okay. It's for both of us. I swear. You drive it whenever you want. - It's ours. - Nice try, Jimmy. But Dad gets me a lesbian tracksuit? Hey! We would never wear that. Sorry, Aunt Gale. And you get a damn truck? We got you both something you needed. Can everyone please stop ignoring what fucking happened last year? People were killed. My best friend was killed. Cara and her grandpa spent every Christmas here. How can you act like nothing happened? Winnie, it's time to let that go. Seriously? I killed Mr. Waters. I burnt him to a crisp. And we never talk about it. The town never talks about it. Everyone just moved on. Winnie, it's Christmas Eve. Why would you want to relive that? It's got a 6.2-liter engine, which is pretty amazing. Merry Christmas, kid. Boyfriend Robbie? He's intense. Robbie? Vicki, hey, got a sec? What the fuck, dude? We're playing gummy toss here. First to five wins. And I'm up four to two. Wow, cool. Who is this old asshole? Robbie's weird neighbor? I don't know. He brought weed gummies, though. Want one? No. Have you seen Robbie? No. Check the basement. See that shit? I win. Robbie? - Hey back. - What? You said "hey" to me last year at the party, and now I am saying hey back. Kay. It's Bernie, right? Yeah. It's... It's Bernie. So, "It's Bernie"... Good. Have you seen my dumb boyfriend Robbie? Yes. He's in the backyard. Will you shut the hell up? I'm looking for Robbie. He's in the laundry room. I thought you said he went outside? Yeah, I did 'cause that's... I just saw him there so... Weirdo's lying. He's in the laundry room. Get out of here, Weirdo. You have very good aim. Wow. Just wow. Seriously? Hey, Winnie! Winnie, wait! Finally. I was so sick of just sneaking around all the time. Finally? Jesus, Darla. I catch you, and you're relieved? Sort of. Yeah. Okay, well, you two suck. Sorry, but you're not exactly present. Darla and I have been doing this for a year, Winnie, and you never noticed. A year? Shit, Win, we never meant for you to find out this way. Robbie, it's sticking out! Winnie, wait. Don't go... Wait. You were covering for them, weren't you, Weirdo? No, no. I was trying to protect you... I don't need help from you! Shit. No school. No best friend. No boyfriend. No one cares. It's like I don't exist. Everyone would be better off... if I was... never born. Guys, did you see that? Did the power go out or something? My God. Help me! Help! Help! I'm at the wharf near Angel Park! Somebody's trying to kill me. Ma'am, did you break my window? Buck, he's after me! He was trying to kill me! The Angel? What? Yes! Hey, Chuck. I'm gonna need some backup. Some of that chalk that we outline the people on. Can we get some more of that caution tape? I feel like... I feel like we need to be a little more cautious here. Chip, can we get a canine unit down here? I-I don't think it's gonna help catch him but it just... it helps the vibes, you know? This looks pretty good. I mean, not this spot. Obviously... Buck. Yeah? When did you become a cop? Do I know you? Where is the sheriff? I'm the sheriff. Sheriff Waters. Show me some respect. Okay. What is going on? Where's Sheriff Beatty, and why's everyone acting like this is no big deal? Ma'am... It's Winnie. - You know that. - Okay. Winnie. Sheriff Beatty was murdered almost a year ago. I've been in charge ever since. You're joking. It's true. Sheriff Beatty was killed shortly after the Angel Park murders. He was victim number five. Five? Have there been more than five? How many have there been? Well, this is... 26 or 27? The Angel strikes every couple of weeks. How can that be? Everyone knows who did it. You know who did this? Who did this? Hey! - Brother. - Is this her? Yeah. You never had a witness before. - Yeah. - Buck? Hi. Hi. I'm Henry Waters. You okay? You're okay. It's okay. Whoa, whoa, easy, easy. Easy, easy. Yeah, I'm gonna invade your personal space. I want you to know, you have this town's full support. Anything you need, you just... you just let Uncle Buck know. Now, as mayor, I want you to know that you have a friend here in Angel Falls. Now, are you just visiting our town, or do have family here? She... she can't talk, she's so scared. It's okay. You're all right. She says she knows who did it. Is that so? I-I don't know, actually. I misspoke. I was chased, but then he disappeared. Never saw his face. Wish I did. Well, lucky you. He was about your height, Mayor. Anything else? Nope. Don't you have stuff to do, Buck? - A report to file? - Well, I... Why don't you keep an eye on that girl? In which order? Mom. Thank God. Mom. Are you drunk? What are you doing here? I clicked the option to leave the pizza on the porch. Where's Jimmy? Jimmy?! Jimmy, are you here? Hey. What's going on? Who are you? Dad, where's Jimmy? What? Is this a joke? It's not funny. Jimmy?! Hey! Shh. Jimmy?! You're looking for Jimmy? Why? I need to find him. What for? I just... I need his help. Honey... Jimmy is... dead. No, no. I... That's not... that's not possible. I'm so sorry. I saved him. I swear. I swear I saved him. You need to get out of here. Just go easy on her. I think she's in shock. My son was murdered a year ago. I had one kid. Now I have none. You need to get out of this house. I'm sorry. Citizens of Angel Falls, this is your favorite mayor reminding you all that it's one hour until curfew. Why not head inside early and make some cocoa? Henry Waters. He owns it all. Weird neighbor Pete. Vicki. What's in the pipe? Some good old crank. Cut the shit. Have you seen Robbie? Or Darla? I need their help. Hello? My God. Bernie. Hi. You know me? No. Then why are you acting like you do? I don't know. Okay. Weird story. I think I'm dead or invisible. I can see you. We all can see you so you're not dead or invisible. Right, right. No, I totally get that. It's just, you don't know me, right? That's right. I don't. And no one else here knows me. Yo, Tara, do you know me? No. Yo, Chad, do you know me? I'd like to. Ew, barf, no, bye. See? No one knows me. No one in this whole town knows me. So, um, who are you? I'm Winnie Carruthers. I'm Jimmy Carruthers' sister. Okay. That's super effed up. You're just playing with me? You're trying to get me to freak out. Someone will point and laugh at me? God, this while school messes with me. This is, like, next-level gross. Bernie, we go to school together. I don't think that we do. We did. You got to help me. Robbie and Darla. They're the "it" couple. This is his house. I know. Invisible a minute ago, and now she knows whose house this is. It's like make up your mind. Robbie. Darla. That's us. Are you two in love? Three years strong. Yeah. You know our names. What's yours? Winnie. Okay, well, good to know ya, Winnie. Shit! Kick me! Kick me in the junk! What the hell are you doing? What does it look like, bro? He's kicking my ass! What is this town? The lights look so cool. My God, there's been more murders. So? So? Dude, people died. More people. So fuckin' what? Am I just supposed to stop living life? Live in perpetual fear? Let it kill my buzz? Come on. I must be drunk to keep listening to this. What did I say? Really drunk. I am so misunderstood. Help me! Open the fucking door! Please. They really are in love. Carruthers, Carruthers, Carruthers. Then I'm really gone. Unfortunately, citizens of Angel Falls, the killer did strike again. But know that I am working on it. I'm going to solve this. My men are more than equipped to handle the situation. So please take comfort in that Weirdo. Weirdo, I'm talking to you. Why are you showing up everywhere? We don't want you here. Murders for a year, and you have a party? Murders for a year, and you still treat her like shit? Plus, the drugs? We're mourning, okay? Quit pursing your lips, Vicki. Your mouth looks like an asshole. Come on, Weirdo. Let's fuckin' go. Who are you? Great party. My mouth doesn't look like an asshole. My God, did you see their face? No. I hope that they don't think about that every day for the rest of their life. Do you think... Bernie, wait. What? The killer is still out there, right? Very much so. Yeah. We got to stop him. Come with me. Stupid Pete, stupid Weirdo. And that other girl? Who is that? My God, I don't care. Are you always alone for Christmas? My dad caught my mom. He left when I was little, and, my mom's usually with whatever ass bucket she's dating, so... I do the best I can. It's nice, Bernie. You designed these? And these. If I can ever scrounge up the money, I'm going to New York. Fashion school. Really? NYCU was my plan, too. Was. Photography. Didn't end up working out. Maybe it will and we'll end up there together. Whoa. You did this? It's kept me going. Wait. What do you mean by that? The victims have been mostly teenagers. And he murders every few weeks. It's Henry Waters. You don't believe me. I mean... I stood under the aurora and said everyone would be better off if I never existed. Well, wish granted. Because I'm seeing what Angel Falls is like without me. Everyone at school calls you Weirdo. Not like "a weirdo," they literally named you Weirdo. How would I know that? You heard that tonight from Vicki. Just hear me out. Last Christmas Eve, Mr. Evans was murdered in his home first. Then Eddie and Cara were murdered at the park party. Plus... Jimmy. Well, in the version where I still exist, I killed the killer, and it was Henry Waters. He killed Eddie and Cara and then he came after me and Jimmy. But I killed him. I saved Jimmy. You took out the killer, and you're saying it was Mayor Waters. It was! God. I wasn't there to save him. And now he's dead. All the offed teenagers were part of families with businesses in town. Or they had businesses in town. Had? The kids died. And then the businesses died. And then you weren't around to stop him, so he just kept going. And now he owns the whole damn town. It's like everyone just gave up. And he likes killing. Look, I want to believe you. I mean, it makes sense. Henry Waters is a twat. He's now mayor. He killed the last sheriff so his TikTok cock dumb-ass brother Buck could take over, which makes Mayor Waters untouchable. But let's say you're just... you're some girl... some potentially crazy girl no one knows. And the day you reveal yourself in town is the day there's another... massacre. And then another murder at the party we were just at. What? Pete was killed at the party, Winnie. But I was with you. You went outside alone. Come on, Bernie! It wasn't me! How can I be so sure? Come on, come on! Go, go, go! Holy crap, you aren't the killer! You're telling the truth! You don't exist! You're George Bailey! Will you be my Clarence? Absolutely! Citizens of Angel Falls, this is your mayor, reminding you to have a safe and Merry Christmas! Wait, wait. Hold on. It's curfew time! It's so pretty. It exploded when I made my wish. It shouldn't be here. What do you mean? I mean it's super rare to see an aurora from our town. We aren't close enough to the Arctic. But it's here. And so are you. I don't think that's a coincidence. Come on. Is this still open? Yeah, it's the only thing in town Henry Waters doesn't own. How do we get in? I work here. We're safe here overnight, Winnie. Loosen those shoulders. This is my happy place. A Merry Christmas to you, uncle! Thank you. And God save you! Bah! Humbug! Christmas a humbug? You can't mean that, I'm sure. This is one of my favorites. What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough. Come, then. What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough. Win? Did being unborn hurt? I'm tired, Bernie. Can we not? - What? - I have so many questions. What? It didn't hurt. It just sort of... happened. So, no plasma or goo or anything? I would just imagine it's like... it's like reverse childbirth. Where do you come up with this kind of stuff? Why are you here? In this... reality? To learn some lesson? To appreciate life? I learned that lesson quickly. I do wish I was born. I wish Jimmy was alive. See? Nothing. I know we just met, but I have no doubt this town was better with you in it. A Merry Christmas to you! A Merry Christmas! Bernie? Bernie? Good morning! I couldn't sleep at all. You snore so loud. But look what I found. Do you shoot? I try. I mean, it's probably not as good as you. I can barely get a photo in focus. You stayed up all night doing this? Yeah, I live for this kind of shit. The aurora is why you're here. It's rare for it to be seen in our town, but it does happen. And local folklore says the lights are the spirit of someone who died violently. - Henry Waters. - Yeah. You killed him in your world, right? Violently. His spirit sent you here, Winnie. And... there's more. The aurora's fading. And if it fades away completely, I'm stuck here. Exactly. What do I do? My best guess? Kill him again. Before the aurora disappears. You'll get your wish to go back and reset... everything. Yay! Merry Christmas. This is tonight? Yep. A new Christmas festival in town gifted to us by Mayor Waters. "Are you naughty or nice? Only Henry Waters can answer that?" This could be our only chance. How do we get to him? This whole town is basically up his ass. I think there's one person who can help us. He's closer to Henry Waters than anybody. You again. I just need to talk to you. It's about Jimmy. I'm not going away until you talk to me! I don't exist, man! I can do this all day! Subtle. I need to talk to him. Tell me how you know Jimmy. Make something up. He's my brother. And you're my aunt. Can I come in? I'm your aunt? Yes. You're my mom's sister. Dad works for Henry Waters. Okay, tell me something you can't Google. Your ass froze to the ground because you were rocking an Aguilerean thong at the 1999 Christmas Eve park party. I always knew that thong would bring people together one day. What's an Aguilerean thong? Judy! What did I say? No more wine. Leave her alone. Do you have my Ambien? Do you have her Ambien? Who is that? You don't want to know. I mean, he's upstairs if you really want... You have a lovely home. Working on Christmas? For Mr. Waters. Always. Are you okay? You want to talk about Jimmy? You knew him? Yeah. He was... great. Yeah, he was. I used to go to school with Jimmy. I loved watching him play. Yeah. He was all-state. Two years in a row. I remember this one game, he threw for six touchdowns. He was so, so, so good. I remember that. That was the state semis. I got so excited that I... that I spilled hot cocoa... All over your pants. Yeah. Jimmy always lit up when he told me that story. God, I miss him so much. So do I. You know, it's really something. One person, one life, can change everything, just by being gone. And they don't even know it. And they are so lucky that they don't get to see the pain they left in their wake. And they should be so lucky. Could you imagine? What seeing this could do to a person? I know who killed him. Come on. Don't start this. I was there that night. I saw what happened. What do you mean? If you were there, why didn't you say something then? I couldn't. It was Mr. Waters. It was Henry Waters? My best friend? My boss? You're saying he killed my son? Yes. We need to stop him. Goddamnit! Why did you come here again? Why are you so intent on hurting my family? Dad, he killed Jimmy! Dad? What? You called me dad. No. I-I just... I'm not your dad. I have no children. You need to get out of the house, go. - He killed Jimmy. - Goddamnit! The guy that you are accusing of murder right now, he got me this house. He feeds this family. He paid for the burial of my son! So, get the fuck out of here! Go! Are you okay? Hey, it's okay. My family, this town... it died that night with Jimmy. I got to fix this. Why is that strange man kissing your neck? Don't let that bastard scream at you like that. Yeah. Don't let that bastard scream at you like that. Who are you? Who are you? Mom has a side piece? Pieces, plural. Told you you didn't want to know. Goddamn mess. You heard me, Judy? You're a goddamn mess! I didn't realize that was your mom. David is not the man he used to be. Well, that's true. He comes and goes at all hours. Even in the middle of the night. Look, there he fucking goes again! You're not nice. Regardless, my husband thinks he's tough. Don't let him trick you! Wait, Winnie. They don't even know that they're your family, right? I know it sucks. I've seen like a zillion randos playing tonsil hockey with my mom, but... we need them. We need someone. Aunt Gale! That guy needs to leave. Mom! No! No! Gale, we got to go, we got to go! Come on! Winnie, let's go! Go, go, go! Stop! We have to step over him. Go. He's still breathing. That's okay. I got you. Okay, come on. What are you doing? I have to kill him. Yes, you can do it, Winnie. Dad. I told you... I'm not your dad. It's almost gone. That should be good. I can't believe my dad is the one doing this. First Karen and now Judy. I just... Karen? He killed her this past summer. And then Waters took over her print shop a week later. I saw something in his eyes. My dad is not fully... my dad. His eyes have felt like that for a year. The aurora, Jimmy... Jimmy's murder broke my dad. Waters already owned him. Now he controls him. Just like everyone else whose life he destroyed. So, Waters did the first killing? And is using my dad to punish his competition. Making him kill in order to expand his empire. We can still change it back. Kill the killer. Remember? - Hold up. - You saw the aurora. It's gonna disappear tonight. Once it's gone, there could be no stopping him. I have to kill my own dad? Correct. Good. Look, you can think of it as a dream, right? You kill him, then you wake up. And you get your life back. Weirdo is right, kid. You're an unexpected wrinkle. Your dad did not plan on you. You are his target now, Winnie. If you don't kill him, he'll kill you. And so many others in this town. So... what's our plan? We lure him here. All right. Let's kill my not-dad dad. I do mean it. What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough. Now, Winnie! But, Robbie, I can't see! Come on down, Bernie. It's just Robbie and Darla. Is that a baseball bat? Why are you here? We had our first date here. It's a tradition. Yeah, they're kind of here a lot. These two. I can't. So, why did you attack us on our thirdiversary? Of course it's your anniversary. Yeah, we are so lucky that we started dating on Christmas Eve. So lucky. Yes, we are. - Blech! - Blech. Robbie! - Robbie, where are you? - Where is he? Bernie? I can't see! Darla? Darla?! Where'd you go?! Robbie! Darla? Robbie?! Hey! Darla? Careful, Darla! Darla, watch out! Darla! Darla! Darla! Babe! Babe! Shoot, shoot, shoot. No! No! Get off me! Robbie?! Robbie, run! Shit. Get to the lobby! You did it. You did it. This is the spot. Let's hope this works. Can I just say, um... you like me? Right? Weirdo. Of course I like you. This Christmas was gonna be my last. What? You heard me. This was gonna be it. But you... you helped me realize. You matter, Bernie. Yeah. I wasn't Clarence. You were. I hate to see you go. But reset it. I'll be fine. I promise. I want my life back. I want my life back. I want to go home. Let me go back! He killed my goddamn mom, my aunt! Do I need to suffer any longer?! Winnie, we can figure this out- Give me my life back, you hack! Bernie, what do I do? People of Angel Falls! Are you on my naughty list? Crap. I think the aurora heard you. It looks angry. We need to kill Waters. The Holcombs! The Holcombs have been nice, of course. There they are. What a lucky couple. Year after year, always nice, and we appreciate that. Well, thank you. Merry Christmas. Buck Waters! You've been naughty. No, no. Come to me, little brother. Come. Don't we love Buck? He's been such a great sheriff for our town. We love Buck, don't we? But, my little brother, you've been naughty. I know. I found out last week that Sheriff Buck here put in for a transfer. Yeah, he did. Now, why would you do that? Get out of here! I don't want to do this anymore, Henry. It's okay. It's okay. You don't have to. You don't have to. I forgive you. Winnie, they're all just watching. We made it worse. I forgive you. This! I do this all for you! Only Henry Waters can give you everything you need! He's an angel! - He's your angel. - Someone do something. That's beautiful. Our angel. Get out of here! All of you! Well, now... what do we have here? An outsider and a pariah. Hi there, Weirdo. How's your mom? Your dad caught her with Henry Waters. You ruined her life. Life? What life? Bring them up. I want to talk to them. Come on. Get 'em up here. Let's have some fun. Ruined her life? It's a little annoying 'cause David was supposed to take care of you. It's another one for the naughty list, dear. So, David was just like the rest of these people? More of your drones? Drones? Well, that's an ugly thing to say in front of all these fine people. David needs me. Like they do. The night I broke him, when I took his only son, he saw my true power. And he came to his senses, and so will you. Very soon. Well, I guess there's something you should know. What's that? We fucking killed him. Did you really? That's a shame. This outsider's dangerous. And she allies herself with our town's most pathetic. You don't know Angel Falls. What do you think? You think you're gonna come up here and liberate these people? They desire to be ruled. They need me. The people in this town care about each other. And they know they don't need you. You have no idea what you are... I've always fucking hated you! Get your fuckin' hands off me. This is cashmere. Get off me. Don't embarrass me, okay? I can handle this. Ooh. Ooh, you like it rough? Just like your mom... You fuckin' bitches. Hey, what the fuck? Hey! Hey, get away from me! Back up, piss heads! I'll use it! You dumb little sluts. You just made my naughty list! And you made ours. I was here to help you. My room! I made it. Christmas! We should give this to her as soon as she wakes. We owe that to her. Mom! - Whoa. - What is this for? Christmas. It's Christmas day, right? Of course. Honey, you're being silly. Yeah, it better be. We got you a present. You got to open it now, though. We thought you could use a new camera. I love you. - Aw, honey. - Love you. Good morning. Merry Christmas to you, too! Someone's got the hangover emotions. The hangover? You get one of those nights a year. Do you hear me? You're too young to drink. - I got drunk? - So drunk, kid. Aunt Gale, Karen. You're okay. Of course we're okay. What a long night. I didn't get into NYU, Mom. Honey. It's a relief. It would have cost us a lot of money. It's okay. It's fine. Really. I love it here. I belong here. I'm sorry we didn't let you heal. We're here for you, sweetheart. No more ignoring anything. We're both so proud of you. Aunties, too! Aunties, too! - Okay... - You guys. Alright, fam. Let's tear these presents open. - Come on, chop-chop. - This is my favorite part! Bernie. Honey? Whoo! I love Angel Falls! Merry Christmas, movie theatre! Whoo! - You look great! - Okay! No. It's okay. I'm okay. You two are cute together. You fit. It's better this way. Okay. Whoo! Thanks, Win! I know. It's fine. Open the door, Bernie! What are you doing here? Bernie, no. I know that it's hard right now, but I'm your friend, and I can't let you do this. You matter, Bernie. You! I remember! I'm so glad you remember. Hi. Hi. Okay, get dressed. We're gonna go to my house for breakfast. And then we're going to the Clova for a Christmas movie marathon! Okay. Get your shit together, Weirdo. I don't have all day. Don't ever call me Weirdo again. You got it, Bernie.
