Good morning Mr. Popinga. She's late this morning, three minutes. Is she? I didn't notice. I sometimes think you should be doing my job. It's an important one. You take a great interest in trains, Mr. Popinga. I'm more interested in the places they go to. Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, exciting isn't it? I haven't thought about it. No? Well, I'm sorry, good day to you sir. Good day Mr. Popinga. Good morning, sir. Morning. Good morning, sir. Nice morning, Mr. Popinga. Quite. The following orders are to go out this morning without fail. Invoice number 397, stores for the, she sails at three this afternoon. Invoice number 398, fuel oil for the Maria. Invoice num... - You can start on those. - Yes, sir. Have you heard anything yet? Is there a chance, Mr. Popinga? Well, not yet. I thought I'd wait till he's in the right mood. Oh, I see. Mr. Popinga, I hate to pester you but... Merkemans, the first chance I get, I... Good morning sir. Good morning, Mr. de Koster. Good morning, Popinga. Mr. de Koster? Yes? This is Mr. Merkemans, he was managing director of the deyonga biscuit company. Yes? He's looking for work and I thought that perhaps... Anything, Mr. de Koster, anything at all. The deyonga biscuit company. Yes, sir. Isn't that the company that went bankrupt? Some, uh, scandal. Yes, sir, but I was not responsible, and Mr. Popinga will tell you. I have here the report of the investigation. I've shown to Mr. Popinga, they proved that I was not to blame, it was Mr. Deyonga who did it. He falsified the books. It is always somebody else's fault, Mr.? Merkemans. You were the managing director, it was your responsibility. No, Mr. Merkemans, no, there is nothing for you here. This firm has a reputation for integrity and honesty. And morality, am I right, Popinga? Yes, sir. It took a long time to build this reputation, Mr. Merkemans. Good day, sir. I'm sorry. Can I? Mr. de Koster? Yes? I'm Lucas. Ah, Mr. Lucas. Yes, yes, yes. Of course, come in. Well, as I told you over the telephone, I doubt if we have the information you want. But of course, I am entirely at your service. Sit down, sir, sit down. The gentleman who came in with you, your father? Yes, the head of the firm. But he doesn't concern himself with the details, if you understand. I understand. And the gentleman in here. Does he concern himself with the details? Ah, yes, Mr. Popinga, our chief clerk. May I speak with him? Of course. He knows more about my business than I do myself. - Cigar? - No, thank you. Yes, sir? Come in, Popinga. This is Mr. Lucas. He's with the police department in Paris. How do you do, sir? I'm very we", thank you. Well, Popinga, it seems that a good deal of Dutch money has been turning up in Paris illegally. A black market currency operation, is that what you're after? Where the money comes from. Yes, well in the course of his investigation, Mr. Lucas has come to the conclusion that some of this money comes from here, from groningen, right? He'd like to examine our books. Our books, sir? He believes it may help him to track down the criminal he's looking for. Oh. We, of course, have nothing to conceal, as you know, but I've told Mr. Lucas that we are entirely at his disposal, right? Oh, yes, sir. Our books are open books, sir. Open books. How far back to your accounts go, Mr. Popinga? They date from the founding of the firm, sir, in 1628. Of course, with all due respect to my predecessors, I can only guarantee their accuracy for the last 18 years. Before that, I was not with the firm. Well, should we take a look at them? Certainly. Popinga is the best bookkeeper in groningen. Perhaps the best chess player, too. Next to you, Mr. de Koster. Oh, you play chess? - Yes. - That is my passion. Really? We have a very good chess club here. Perhaps you'd like to join me there this evening? Oh, that would be delightful. Might even find my criminal there. At our chess club, sir? Why not? Interesting thing about criminals, Mr. Popinga, is that they're just like anybody else. That's why it's possible for us to catch them. They're so human, so ordinary. Anybody can get to them, Mr. Popinga, anybody. Even you. I beg your pardon, sir. No Mr. Lucas, Popinga is the one man who would never be a criminal. His wife, you understand, his wife simply would not allow it, would she, Popinga? No, sir. I've told you, Karl, over and over again not to eat your food so fast. I'm sorry, papa. Anything new at the office today? Oh, the usual. Although there was a man who had to look at the books, some detective or other from France. Detective from France? Oh, it was nothing. He just wanted to look at the books. He was very cordial. Very respectful. He complimented me on how well they were kept and in Mr. de Koster's presence. That's very nice dear, isn't it? That chap merkemans was in again. That poor man, and the poor wife. She's really very nice, you know, and the children are lovely. I tried to help him, I spoke to Mr. de Koster about him personally. Well, that was nice of you. But there's nothing to be done for him. We have a reputation, integrity and honesty. And morality, right? I've heard all of that before, dear. It took a long time to build that reputation, right? Of course, dear. You're always right. 722 from Paris. You and your silly old trains. I think I'll go down to the chess club for awhile. - Tonight? - Why not? It's Tuesday. Your evening is on Wednesday. Mr. de Koster will have a guest there, that detective I spoke of. Might be a good thing if I dropped in for awhile, create a good impression. Alright, I'll get your coat. Good night, children. Good night, papa. You won't be late though, will you? Of course I won't. It looks as though you've got me, Mr. Lucas. Just luck. It can't be, this is our third game. Don't you ever lose? With chess, very often. At the more serious game, less often. Oh by the way, this woman. Do you know her? Charming, beautiful. Not from around here. Never been a woman like this in groningen, has there, Popinga? No, sir. She doesn't look Dutch. Thought you might have met her in one of your trips to Paris. Who is she? Your move. Oh, nobody important. Just thought you might have run into her. Not many moves left for me, are there? Might be better if I gave in now. Oh, don't do that, sir, there's still a chance. I'm sorry. No, no, no, go on Popinga, you take over. Let me refill these. Go on. Fill these up. Yes, sir. Check. Well tried, Mr. Popinga. Thank you. Tell me, Mr. Popinga, have you money of your own in de Koster's hands? Oh, yes sir, nearly all our savings. Get me a schnapps. A schnapps, sir? Checkmate. Don't look so crestfallen Mr. Popinga. Your boss made the wrong moves, you know. How's it going? Checkmate, sir. Kees? Kees? I didn't hear you come in. Anything wrong? Can I get you anything, cup of chocolate? What is it? Maria? Do you think merkemans knew that his firm was going to go bankrupt? What? Do you think he knew? And didn't do anything about it? What is it? What's the matter? Nothing. Kees? Mr. de Koster, what are you doing, sir? Get out, Popinga, get out! But my books, you're burning my books. Mr. de Koster? It's over, it's all over. de Koster, what is it? What's happening? It's over, Popinga. We're through, we're ruined. What are you saying? Tomorrow morning, the ancient firm of de Koster and son will be in liquidation. Bankrupt, you understand? Now go home. There's nothing you can do about it. Mr. de Koster, it isn't true, it can't be. My books would show it. Oh, your books, get out of the way. But, Mr. de Koster. What are you doing, where are you going? Please tell me. All I own is in the firm. Everything I own. Mr. de Koster? Mr. de Koster, please tell me what happened. Maybe I can help. Is it the girl? What girl? I saw you with her at the station. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. It was the same girl in the photograph. I lied for you, Mr. de Koster. I didn't tell Mr. Lucas. I lied for you. You have to tell me what you're going to do. What do you expect me to do? Face people? Tell them? Tell them I fell in love with a girl in Paris? Tell them I stole for her? Looted my own firm for her? Yes, that's the truth, Popinga. Should I announce it, put an advertisement in the paper? There's no way out for me. What are you going to do? Death before dishonor? Oh, Mr. de Koster. Tell them not to waste any money dragging the canal for my body. Goodbye, Popinga. I'm sorry for you. In a strange way, you are the only one I am sorry for. No, Mr. de Koster, I won't let you do this... Let go, Popinga. Please, Mr. de Koster, no, no. You were lying. You're running away. Now look here. You're not killing yourself. You're running away with the money. With my money. Listen kees, be a good fella. You're running away to her. Listen, kees, I'll share it with you. Half of it, half the money. No, no, I won't let you do it. Kees! Have a... You're running away to her. Liar, cheat, liar! Kees, listen! Liar! Mr. de Koster? Help, somebody help! Why, Mr. Popinga, this is a surprise. May I join you? I was beginning to dread the long journey to Paris by myself. You are going all the way to Paris, I hope. Yes, I am. Good. Anything the matter? Nothing, you startled me, that's all. I didn't expect to see you again so soon. I'm equally surprised. As a matter of a fact, at the back of my mind, I couldn't help thinking that I might meet someone I know on this train. Can you guess who I thought it would be? Who? Absurd, of course, I thought it might have been Mr. de Koster. Did you see him buy the ticket? It was for me. You know, Mr. Popinga, I must learn not to underestimate you. Really I must. No, as a matter of fact, I did not see him buy your ticket. I merely deduced from the facts that I knew that he would probably be leaving town tonight. So he's confided to you the unfortunate difficulty he's in. Yes. Well, we can talk freely then. He told you that he's looted the firm of its profits. That you're going bankrupt. Tell me Mr. Lucas, was there anything in my records to indicate... No, no, no. I'm quite sure you knew nothing whatever about it. The only thing that is not explained is what you're doing here now. He ordered me to leave for Paris immediately to try to borrow some money to keep the firm going. He bought my ticket for me and here I am. So I see. Yes, it's very simple. Thank you. What about a game of chess? Well, yes, if you like. I've got a portable set. I sometimes play alone on these long trips. Helps to while away the time, you know. It's never quite the same thing, is it? Yeah, let's play on that case of yours. Just about the right size. White, you're lucky. You know Popinga, it's a tragedy, your having all your savings in the company. I thought I was in such a good position to know how sound the firm was. You had no suspicion at all? Huh? de Koster, you never guessed what he was up to? No. Well, I must say, I admire your loyalty. A man destroys you and you go off on a wild goose chase to borrow money to help him. Well, obviously, if I do my duty by the firm, I'll be helping myself as well. Oh, yes, yes, yes. Do you know what I'd have done in your place? What? If for 18 years, I'd repressed every impulse towards self-expression to serve my boss and then this boss suddenly admitted that he was a crook, a licentious scoundrel, he'd ruined the firm and he'd ruined me but would I please run off to Paris to help him? You know what I think I'd have done? What? I'd have killed him. Your move. I've bad news for you, Mr. Popinga. de Koster's dead. He is? Yes. He's been shot. Shot? Better hurry, haven't we? It would be better, Popinga, truly, if you were to tell me now what you know about this. Where's the gun, in that case? Can you stop trying to trick me? Where is it? Stop it, will you? He wasn't shot and you know it. He committed suicide, he drowned himself. How do you know? 'Cause I saw him, that's how. You saw him? Yes. He gave me my ticket and I started for the station and then I thought, why's he trying to get rid of me? So I started back and I saw him jump. Did you call for help? Yes. Nobody came? Nobody. You watched him drown and then got on the train and went to Paris? Yes, he sent me. You knew he was dead, nevertheless, you went to borrow money to help him? Yes. Alright, Popinga, suppose you tell me what really happened. Suppose you stop the lies. Lies? You mean 18 years of those dull, stupid books of mine? Those beautiful, careful books? Those were the lies. What's the truth? What's the truth? That he's dead and I'm glad. That he left a note, a suicide note, in his own handwriting, that's the truth and you know it. What are you going to do now? In Paris? I'll be free. Free? Yes. I've always watched other people eating cake. That is, Mr. Lucas, unless you can prove that he did not commit suicide. Can you? Who's move? Mine. Paris in 5 minutes, monsieur, Paris in 5 minutes. Paris in 5 minutes, monsieur, Paris in 5 minutes. Good morning, Mr. Popinga. Good morning, Mr. Lucas. Ever been in Paris before? No, but it's a place I've always wanted to see. Haven't traveled much? No, only from groningen to Amsterdam and back to groningen. I see. Uh, Mr. Popinga? I hope you'll appreciate that my questioning of you last night was merely an attempt to be of some service to you. Was it? But when arrive in Paris, my position may become an official one. I think I'll rinse my face. Unless you were? No, no, no, after you. Thank you, it was clumsy of me. No, no, it could've happened to anyone. Popinga, Popinga! Popinga, Popinga! Louis? Louis? What? The downstairs bell, he's here. Who? The dutchman, de Koster. So? So, go away. Listen to me, don't waste a lot of time with him. Get the money. Why Louis, you're jealous? Use the back staircase, will you? And press the door release. I will. I am at the garage if you want me. Yes? Mademoiselle rozier? Who are you? Allow me to introduce myself, my name is kees Popinga. I'm a friend of Mr. de Koster's. May I come in? Why? Well, he said he was a friend of yours and I'm a friend of his. Come in, close the door. Am I disturbing you? Not yet. What kind of a friend of his are you? Are you a policeman? No, I'm not a policeman. Then take your hat off. Oh. And put that silly case down and tell me who you are or get out of here. I'm his chief clerk, he sent me here. He's dead. Dead? Yes, I'm sorry. What happened? Well, the police were up there, Mr. Lucas, so he killed himself. Just killed himself, just like that? Yes, he jumped in the canal. But why? Well, you know. The firm being bankrupt and everything. Did he, um, did he give you something? Something to give to me? No, he just jumped in the canal. Just jumped in the canal? That's fine. May I take off my coat? Take off your coat? Why? Well I want to talk to you. I want to warn you. Mr. Lucas, it seems, knows about you, too. What does he know? You know, that you and Mr. de Koster were together. What's that got to do with your coat? Nothing. I thought perhaps, I... I want to help you. You? You want to help me? Yes. How? Well, Mr. de Koster can't help you anymore and, well, you know. No, I don't. What do you mean? Are you married? Yes, but... What did you say you did? I was his clerk. His clerk? His chief clerk for a long time. A very long time. Does it pay well, a job like that? Oh, yes. I have a very nice house in groningen. In a very nice district. And I'm a member of the chess club. Stop laughing at me. Wonderful, oh you're wonderful. Mustn't laugh at me, do you hear? de Koster's dead, long live de Koster's clerk. Chief clerk! Are you mad? Get out of here, now, quick. No. No? You're too ridiculous, get out, get out. I beg your pardon. Mademoiselle? Yes? Are you in a hurry? No hurry at all. Do you know Paris well, monsieur? No, I've never been here before. Your wife is with you? No. Oh, then perhaps you feel lonely. Yes, perhaps I'm lonely. Where are you staying? I don't know. Mademoiselle, is it necessary in Paris to produce a passport when you register? In most places. Do you know of one where it is necessary? One that is clean and respectable? I think I know just the place. We can try it, anyway. Yes, we can try. It is a very nice room and has a very good view of the. It's on the first floor, isn't it? All the way on the top of the stairs. Thank you. Don't forget to let me have your passport, if you please. Oh yes, I will. Merci, monsieur. Thank you. You've been very kind. Aren't you going to ask me in? No, I'm sorry. You'd better go now. Go? I got you into this hotel. - So? - So, two thousand francs. Two thousand francs? Don't be silly. You wouldn't be here without me. 10 guilder, it's a thousand francs. I knew you were a dutchman. What are you up to, anyway? Nothing. Are you in trouble? Are you? Tell me. Maybe I can help you. Will you go now? And he didn't tell you where he'd gone? No. Where is he, Michelle? I told you, I threw him out. That's all I know. You mean to tell me that a country bumpkin arrives at your flat with 100,000 guilder in cash and you just throw him out? - Michelle. - I don't know what you're talking about. Now, please, Michelle, you were expecting de Koster at your flat with the money, I know that. Alright, well Popinga arrives, and he tells you that de Koster is dead, you admit that? Yes. And it never even occurred to you that he might have the money himself. Has he? You know very well he has. How did he get it? What happened? Murder? There was a suicide note. He did kill him, didn't he? No, as a matter of fact, he did not. But he believes that he did. What makes you think that? Because he knows that I'm after him. He's a hunted man. He's taken a large sum of money. Unless I catch him quickly, he's gonna to do something desperate. That one? Something desperate? I'm certain of it. Now, help me with this Michelle, please. Do something decent for once in your life. This man, Popinga can be saved. You seem to be really concerned about this man, Popinga. Yes, I am. Alright. Thank you, Michelle. Keep an eye on her, will you? If she knows where he is, she'll lead you to him. If she doesn't, she'll find him. Thank you, sir. A little man with an attache case. - A foreigner? - Yes. With a funny little grey hat? That would be him. He was around here some time ago. He went off with Jeanne. Where can I find her? Oh, probably around at the Georgetown cafe. Thank you, luisette. You must be mad. What do you mean, you won't take it? - I took it. - I'm sorry madam. It's worth a 1,000 francs, the little man said so. Why did he pay me with Dutch man's money? What's the matter Jeanne? Oh, Michelle, how much is 10 Dutch guilders worth? Where did you get it? Kees, kees, wake up. Mademoiselle rozier. Did you have a nice sleep? What are you doing here? Perhaps I was lonely for you. How'd you find me? How? Because I wanted to. Are you sorry? Oh no, I'm not sorry. - We better get out of here. - Why? The police are outside. The police. What about them? Don't you think I know, kees, that you're in trouble? Come along, hurry. Where are you taking me? Hurry up. Come on. What is this? This is a respectable hotel. Come on. Did you murder him? What? de Koster, did you? What are you saying? Lucas thinks you did. You've seen Lucas? You've seen Lucas? Yes. What did he say? He asked me if I'd seen you and I said yes. He asked me if I knew how to reach you and I said no. Then what? Then I found you through that girl. What girl? The girl you gave the guilder to. Why'd you find me? I told you, I wanted to warn you, to tell you. I have a friend, maybe he can help you, he can hide you, can get you new papers. Why are you doing this? I don't know why. Must one always know why? Louis here? He's in the back. Louis? Friend of mine, needs a place to stay for a few days. What's he wanted for? Murder. Him? He's going to need new papers. Maybe a way of getting out of the country. What's this, Michelle? Where'd you find him? It's alright, he's a friend of de Koster's. A close friend. It's a risk. A big one. If it's a question of money... Certainly. Certainly it's a question of money. Any reasonable charges that are necessary, I'll pay. We're wasting time, Louis. How about it? I don't know. Quite a serious charge, murder. Will you take my word for it? He's alright. Take him upstairs. He can have goin's room. Nice to have met you. What? Oh. You'll be sleeping in here. Will the noise keep you awake? No. I like the sound of trains. Michelle, what kind of place is this? You'll be safe here. Who's Louis? A man of action. What's he to you? Michelle, do I have to stay in this place? You'll probably want to wash. Are you gonna stay here too? I don't know, it depends. On what? Oh, things. But you won't be lonely. I don't like to be lonely. No one does. - Michelle? - Goin will take care of you. He's the husky one in the garage. Come on, make yourself pretty. I'll get some coffee. When we get the money, we can get to do what we've always wanted to do. Travel. South America, north Africa. So, be patient, darling. I saw one of Lucas's men hanging around this morning. Are you sure you weren't followed? Nobody followed us, stop worrying. He's a strange one, that new friend of yours. They're all strange. He makes you strange. Oh does he? Well, maybe I feel sorry for him. He's got no future. And he doesn't seem to have had much of a past. Well, as long as he's got the money. Alright. Call him down. Kees? Kees? Kees? Didn't you hear me? Your coffee's ready. Oh yes, of course. Sit down here. Drink it while it's hot. Is anybody else having coffee? Louis has gone to clean up. He doesn't take coffee. I saw you in groningen with Mr. de Koster. So? He trusted you, didn't he? Don't you? He had his arms around you, he kissed you, didn't he? Did he? Don't you remember? Didn't it mean anything to you? Not what he thought it meant. I left my handkerchief upstairs. - I'll get it for you. - No, no. I'll get it myself. She makes good coffee, huh? Not a soul, you're crazy. Must be there. I looked, there's nothing. He's got it, I know. Louis, no! Why not? If he's got it, we'll take it. If he's hidden it, he'll tell us where it is. It's easy. Lucas knows I'm with him, if anything happens... Ah, we're wasting time. Listen, I worked a long time for this money. I'm not going to lose it because you're a hotheaded fool. I'll get it, I promise you. How? He'll give it to me. He'll give it to me himself. He'll beg me to take it. Why should he beg you? You're getting soft over this little guy, are you? Louis, don't be silly. Goodbye, Louis. Do your best. Louis' worried you won't have the money to pay for your new papers. Does he want me to pay in advance? Of course not. Any friend of Michelle's is a friend of mine. Well, I'll see what I can do for you. Will it take long? Couple of days, maybe, I'm not sure. It's rude to stare. Is it? You didn't finish your coffee. I don't want any more coffee, I wanna go for a walk, I wanna get out of here. I'll come with you. You want to? This way. Tell me about the murder. What? de Koster. Tell me how you killed him. What makes you so sure that I killed him? Come on, tell me about it. Why should I? Why not? All you want from me is the money. That's all you wanted from Mr. de Koster. I know. What do you know? Your friend was searching my room just now. So? And you knew about it, didn't you? What if I did? What have you got besides money? What are you, handsome? - Michelle. - Courageous? Please. Adventurous, exciting? You're a cheap little clerk. No. A murderer. You. Understand this. Whether I killed de Koster or not, I am quite capable of killing you. Why don't you? Frightened? Changed your mind? I thought for a moment you were a man. A real man, exciting, alive, capable of danger, of loving, but you're nothing. All you want is to hold onto your stolen money as if you'll drown without it. Well drown with it! Michelle. Michelle, please listen, please. Go home, kees, go home to groningen and take your guilder with you. Louis tells me you're going to stay here for awhile. Yes. Popinga. Popinga. Kees, where are you going? Integrity, honesty, morality. Get out! Get out! Don't be frightened, I'm not gonna hurt you. Let me go. I was afraid you might hurt yourself. We can play here. Werner said so. Of course you can play here. But not in the cars. You might get hurt. You might get cut. Let me go. Here. What is that? Money. Good money, you can buy chocolates with it. I have two children of my own. A little boy and a little girl. Yes. Bored, eh? Well, that's just the way it is. When you're hiding out, you wait. Yes, you wait. Wait for what? If Louis says he'll fix you up, he'll fix you up. Tonight, tomorrow, next day, what's the difference? How long have you known Louis? I only met him yesterday. How long have you known Michelle? Not long. She likes Louis, doesn't she? Who knows? Who knows anything with that girl? Will she be back soon, do you think? Ah, so that's why you're so restless. It's our Michelle, huh? I'd like to phone to her, would she be home? I shouldn't think so. At night, she usually goes to that nightclub. The joie de vivre. She meets people there. People? What kind of people? Oh, people she knows. As you come up, turn out the lights, hmm? When she met Louis, he didn't have a suit. Good night. You can have it. We have a club in Chicago, makes this look like a dump. Chicago, that's my hometown. Sounds fascinating. I'd like to go there someday. Well, if you ever do, look me up and I'll show you around. No, that won't be possible. It would be possible if your wife came along, wouldn't it? Sure, sure. Haven't you had any fun since, since you've been here? Yes, [had a bit of fun last night at the baggali, that's the place. You know what the evening cost me? 50,000 francs. Really? Oh, but, of course, I can afford it, girlie. Doesn't mean a thing to me. I remember one night... Michelle, I want to talk to you. I'm busy. I want to talk to you, please. Scam, bud, you heard what the lady said. I don't want to quarrel with you, sir, but if it becomes necessary to stick this into your heart, ishall. Excuse me. Give me a drink, will you? What do you want? I want to see Paris with you, dinner, dancing. You shouldn't be here, they'll pick you up. I'm not gonna stay out there at that garage. It's the only safe place for you. I don't want to be safe. I want to enjoy myself. I want to see Paris. I don't care what happens. Aren't you worried they'll get your money? I'll take that chance. Kees Popinga, I like you. You do? You're different when you take a chance. Let's go. Goodnight, sir. Wait for us, will you? Mind the horse, there are thieves in Paris. Uh, yes. Very satisfactory. I didn't think you'd be be such a good dancer. I didn't think it myself. But I'm told I do have a sense of rhythm. Darling. You know, the last time I had champagne was with Mr. de Koster. Oh, excuse me. I have the phone call you requested, sir. - What phone call? - Shh. Secret between me and the waiter. Lucas? Guess who? Oh, hello, Mr. Popinga. How are you? How are you? Where are you, still at the office? Hope I'm not disturbing you. Trace it. Look here, Popinga, why not be sensible? You know I'm gonna catch you sooner or later. Why not come around and have a talk about it? He says he wants to see me. I know you want to see me. What's there to talk about? I'm trying to keep you out of trouble. Says he's trying to keep me out of trouble. Too late. Popinga, listen. Who is with you? Who's with me? The most beautiful girl. What'd you do that for? Waiter, get me that number again. Let's go, he traced the call. What do I care? Look, kees, you made your point. I'm impressed, let's go. Waiter, get me my bill. Cafe domino, champs-elysées, do you want them to pick him up? No, he'd have left by the time they get there. Alright thank you. What are you looking for, darling? That guilder note they brought in. I have an idea that after tonight, they'll be quite a few of them floating around. Yes, I'm sorry, I'll have to go down to goin's garage. Put on something warm, darling, the nights are getting so chilly. Good night, pet. Back for breakfast. Excuse me sir, are these... Guilder, sound currency, you take 'em, everybody else takes them, don't they Michelle? Come on. Why did he say he wants to keep my out of trouble? What does he mean by that? He wants to keep you out of trouble by putting you in jail. Maybe I'm not in trouble. Maybe if I went back... Is that what you want? No. Maybe if I sent the money back. The money? You're wanted for murder. Yes. You did kill him, didn't you? I don't know. It's all mixed up in my mind. I wanted to kill him. Maybe that's the same thing. Michelle? Yes? Michelle? It's the most wonderful night in my whole life. I never thought it could be like this. Neven Michelle? Tomorrow we'll go away. Go away, kees, where? Anywhere. North Africa, south america, anywhere. I can afford it, Michelle. Where'd you like to go? Wherever you would like to go, kees. Tomorrow, in the morning, we'll go out and get the money. The money? Yeah, it's out there, you know. Is it, darling? When I first got there, I hid it. You were right. There's no one you can trust. No one but you. If I can't trust you Michelle, there's nothing there. Trust me. Maybe if I hadn't hidden it, we wouldn't be here now. I climbed out of the window and I hid it in one of the cars. Did you, darling? Which one? Tomorrow, in the morning, we'll go and get the money. Which one, kees? All that lovely money and we'll go to places. Wonderful, exciting places. Just you and I, Michelle. Just you and I. You and I, Michelle. Just you and I. Michelle. You and I. Feeling nervous, Michelle? This what you were looking for? It was in that car over there. What do you want? I want Popinga, where is he? At your apartment? How should I know? You know very well, otherwise you wouldn't be around here. Come on, Michelle, you have nothing to win anymore. What do I gain by telling you? Oh, you want to come to terms, do you? Alright, come along, we'll talk. Michelle? Michelle? Michelle? Are you gonna bother me again? I didn't say that. The deal's quite simple, you're giving me Popinga and I'm dropping all charges against you in this case only. How do I know you'll keep your word? Because I'd lose my reputation with every scoundrel in Paris if I didn't. Popinga! He saw us. Kees, kees! Yeah, he went out the back way! Hurry! If he gets away, things will go badly for you. Why? I kept my end of the bargain. That's not what I meant. He's been betrayed. He's got to prove himself to himself. He might try to kill you. He may try, but he won't. Now, just you listen to me, Michelle. If you're so bored flirting with life that the only excitement left you is to flirt with death, that presumably is your business but Popinga is my business. He's not a murderer and I'm not going to let him become one. Well? Stay here. What? Stay here, whatever happens. We're leaving a detective downstairs and you're gonna promise me that you won't attempt to leave this place. On one condition. What's that? Forget kees, stay with me. I'd love to, mademoiselle, but... I'd be afraid. Of what? Afraid I might kill you myself. That young lady's in trouble. Well, she's asked for it. Louis. Louis! Careful, Louis. You see, I have a knife. You'd be hurt if you moved. You didn't think I could do this, did you, Louis? You thought I was nothing, didn't you, Louis? What do you want? You will telephone Michelle. - Michelle? - Yes. You will telephone Michelle and you will tell her that you're in trouble and that she is to come here right away. Right away. Yes? Michelle. Louis, where are you? I'm at the garage. Can you come out here? What's the matter? I'm in trouble. What? Can't you tell me what's the matter? I... I'll tell you when I see you. Is somebody with you? Yes. Pohce? I'm coming out the back way. Tire lever, Louis? Come on Louis, do something. Go on. You're not afraid, are you? You were right, Michelle. You told me I musn't trust anybody, didn't you? Why did you do it, why? Listen to me, kees, please! Listen to you? Listen to you lie to me, listen to you laugh at me? I made a mistake. Lucas is not after you, you're not wanted for murder. No, but I'm going to be. Long live de Koster's clerk. Chief clerk! Lucas promised you'd be all right, that's why I turned you in. It was for you! Yes, for me, all for me. That's why you took the money. That's why you kissed me. You think you can kill me, you thief. You petty little thief. Once before you thought you could kill me, you couldn't then, and you can't now. You poor, strutting little failure. Popinga. Popinga! No! It's the 722 to Paris. Someday I'm going to go to Paris. Popinga, it's me, Lucas. Is anything wrong with my books? No, Popinga, no. Everything balances.
