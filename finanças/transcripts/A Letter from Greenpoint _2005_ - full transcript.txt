The last load of stuff. This is the last load and the snow is coming down. What does that one mean? That's Dante. - Dante. - Dante. Inferno Canto Primo. He is going through the different cycles, or what? Which Dante is this? - The Inferno. - Yes. To the inferno. We made it here. - I want to sing a song. - Yes! Look like... looks very French. Like in some of those paintings. And there are the drunk people. Fourteenth of January, Two Thousand and Four. Snowing. I came back. Our old place... our old home. To pick up something I had forgotten. It's empty. Totally empty. But, how do I feel about it? Nothing much, just empty space. Empty space. Thirty years. Winter outside. It's cold. They say it's snow... it will snow a lot tonight. I'm picking up some boxes from the basement... That's why I'm here. It's empty. Memories... I don't know. It's like memories is on one plane and this space is on another plane. This is just an empty, clean space. The way we moved in, the way it was when we moved in thirty years ago. But exactly thirty years ago. 1974. There are no big... Yes, I mean it's memories... Life is like one thing, and this space... Now it's so clean, it's like another... with no personal... objects in it, just space. Just another... just a space. There must be a lot of... ...of little atoms... of myself, Hollis, Sebastian, Oona, attached to it somewhere, floating in the air. But it's just atoms, totally invisible, totally somewhere else, while we are, all of us, in somewhere else. Somewhere else. The sound. Ah, empty spaces. Empty spaces. Here I am, in this empty space, impregnated with thirty years of life, every wall, floor, ceiling, space itself. It is full of... me, full of Oona, Sebastian, Hollis. This space... we are still here. I guess we are still here. But slowly, slowly, everything will be... ...changed by new and different atoms coming into this space. Waiting for Arunas to come. We have to move some things from the basement, what's left, into the Cadillac. Let's maybe turn off the light. That's it. Arunas will be calling soon. The ladder, yes this ladder, this is the only thing left. Across the street. This empty space, the telephone rings. - Hello. - Hello. Arunas? Arunas? The light. The last. I am disconnecting the light. The first... this is the last trip. And that is about it. And that's the end of this loft. Okay. Goodbye 491. - Goodbye. Nice. - Yeah. - I like it here. - Yeah, me too. Okay. Excuse me. Now you walk in. And... and come back. All right, okay, that's it, stop. This is good, I like this. Now... there you are! Okay, now we can have a pint. Now you have to tell the camera what you really want. Oh yeah that is true. We are on the corner... we are on the corner of Sutton and... And Driggs. Now, this is a nice little bar, but they don't have certain... like, they didn't have Bushmills, but we got Zubrowka and we are very happy. There's an okay bartender... We're with our new friend... what's your name? - I'm Gosha. - This is Gosha, our new friend. - Yeah. And, basically... - Are you of Polish extraction? Are you Polish? - Yeah. - You are? - Yeah. - Oh, so... Now... I exist everywhere; I have no home. But this was not planned. I just looked around and found myself in love with too many places. My feet could walk anywhere. I am troubadour. I am tramp. I've been moving for years. Me too. As you can see those boxes. You can see me in Provence, and by the Tower of Pisa. Now in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. And who knows where I will be tomorrow. ...and race and ethnicity and gender. We need to come together now as one people. We've been attacked by enemies who hate us more than they love life. Not bad. This is soup from the beans. ...Good ideas will stand the test of time. I offer the mainstream voice, and I still believe that that is the right choice... I'm very sensitive about that because I... I get paranoid, everybody thinks I'm twelve. No. Once more. To tomorrow! We are... Tomorrow. Tomorrow, tomorrow, today, now. Past is... past... all past is bloody. There is nothing much to learn from it. Nothing much to learn from it. Believe me or not. Blood is running down the hills of every country... you put your foot on. That's the past. But we are changing for tomorrow. We are going to change it. It's three in the morning. I can't sleep. My stupid mind is working. My head is still working. I can't sleep. You sit there so serious, all your awards. Look at her Jonas, she's so beautiful. You know she's just standing there, quiet. You know, she plays piano, she's so serious. - Come away with me. - I will! I will come away with you, you just call me up and I'm coming with you Norah. Look at her, look! Look! She's for real! Look. She's playing the piano, not sitting there like, "oh, look, I'm pretty." She's just there, and she's focused for real, you know? I mean, look. Look at this, look at this, she's like, yeah. You can see her in the morning, she wakes up, all sleepy-eyed, and she looks at you from the other end of the bathtub and she says, "how you doing?" - And I says... - "How are you doing, Benn?" "How're you doing Benn?" And I'll go, "Norah, you look great at that end of the bathtub. "Do you want to go for coffee before we go?" And then we go for coffee, we sit there, - and she whispers in my ear... - I want to walk with you. That's what she says. She says, "I want to walk with you." On a cloudy day, in fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high, so won't you... Jonas you have to help me. - I will, I will. - You have to help me. - and we'll kiss, on the mountain top. - Did you hear that? "Then come away with me, and we'll kiss, on the mountain top." Jonas I'm gonna cry, I think. No, no. You maybe have to get... I will send this to the... Love is so sweet and so sad at the same time. Love can build a man, and take him down at the same time. For I have known love. In my short time on this world I have seen love. It's like a serpent, - it either bites you... - Nothing like this! This is not obsession, Jonas. It may look like it... No you see the thing is, I don't know her biography so therefore I'm not a stalker. - Yeah, true. - I'm not an obsessive because I don't have pictures of her everywhere. I am a true man. A true gent. - To you, Norah. - Yeah. - To Norah. - To Norah. To Norah. Mitzi, will you be my valentine? Mitzi. Be my valentine, on such a sweet Valentine's Day. I'm split, you know, between you and Maxie a little bit, but I still may... I may marry you. Okay, okay. No, no. Maxie is just... I mean, uh... No, I did not mean it! I left Maxie. I'm with you. Oh forgive me! Now I'm just with this half-finished egg, by myself. Mitzi... I insulted Mitzi. Will you ever forgive me? This is for you, Mitzi. Maybe she will come back. You know, cats, women... It's in Houston where he also met Guy Clark and Jerry Jeff Walker, and the blues legend Lightnin' Hopkins. You had a big influence on Van Zandt's songwriting and guitar playing. This represents the society. You. You could imagine that egg, like something very essential and basic, that's you. Everything is in this egg. You. The essence of you. And... ...the way I see it, your very essence is fucked up. I can... I can swallow your essence and it will come to the other end of me. That's your essence... the society in which I live today. It tastes pretty good though. And that's the trouble with you, the society... that you taste good. You see, you are in this thing of pleasure and... ...megalomania of some kind... ...fantasy about what real life really is. It's all perfumed, embellished, and tastes very good. But it has no essence. No substance. It's all... not... nothing that will carry you across the time and space and dimensional rivers, into the eternity. Everything remains here. We're here. Shells, swallowed, comes out through the other end. Shells, I shovel up into my palm, and throw into the garbage. That's the society I live in today. Thank you my friends. That's how I... Look at the cat. Eating, peacefully, with no pretentions, conquering other countries. With no pretentions being anything but a cat eating cat food. Bless you. Bless you, Mitzi. It's not that easy to be just like that. Not easy. I'm trying. I hope someday I will achieve that state. Just being. Just being, like Mitzi. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen... what happened to... music? ...to be scrounging your next meal. How does it feel? How does it feel? How does it feel? I don't know! How do I feel? Nobody asks me! - Like a complete unknown. - Like a complete unknown! - Like a rolling stone. - Like a rolling stone! You've gone to the finest school all right, miss lonely but you know you only... Of course I want to cry! Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street, and now you're gonna have to get used to it. You say you never compromise, with the mystery tramp, but now you realize, - he's not selling any alibis... - He's not selling alibis! I understand you! and say, "do you want to make a deal?" How does it feel? How does it feel? To be on your own... How does it feel? - With no direction home. - How does it feel? - A complete unknown. - I don't know. Like a rolling stone. Oh you never turned around to see the frowns, on the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you. You never understood that it ain't no good you shouldn't let other people get your... ...after he took from you everything he could steal. How does it feel? Nobody asks me. - And I don't know how I would answer. - To be on your own. No direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone. This is a song that Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg wrote about Paris. It was a... I keep remembering this every time I hear the song, because the song so reflects this piece that's stuck in my mind. The song evokes the Irwin Shaw essay that I think ran in McCall's many years ago, about how desolate Paris is in the winter, the city of light. Here is Yip and Harold's song called "Paris is a Lonely Town." It was written actually for Judy Garland, and this is Karen Akers to sing it. The glamour's gone, the shades are down, and Paris is only a lonely town. Lonely. When love's a laugh and you're the clown, then Paris is only a dreary town, dreary for the loveless clown. This town's a weary merry-go-round and round and round. The chestnut, the willow, the colors of Utrillo But give me Paris anytime. Give me, give me Paris! Give me Paris! ...playing Bizet along the Champs Elysées sounds like way down blues. Paris is a dreary, lonely, oh so lonely town. But give me Paris anytime! Anytime! Give me Paris. Better not take... don't take away my New York too! - Benn? - I think they're wrong. Paris is beautiful, lovely and wonderful. I agree with you Benn. I agree with you! She doesn't know our Paris. ...is such a lonely, lonely town. If any song was wrong, this one is absolutely wrong. Two hours later. And six inches of snow later. It's crazy. Insanity. I don't know what to make of this at all. Springtime in New York... Soda is made with syrup and seltzer water. Why are you telling me this? I demand more. A couple of glass bottles of Coca-Cola... They're already placing the glass Coca-Cola next to the two-liter, plastic Coca-Cola. He found a revelation, when he realizes how far we've come. I think... Yeah. He realizes that this is, will be, a bit of a path to globalization. And we don't care anymore about the actual sensation, about the value. You know the value of everything... the price of everything, but the value is nothing. But whatever. Americans are strong, and I don't think they will be seduced by any such thing, to punish others instead of punish the terrorists who are perpetrating these atrocities. And I think this is the main message that the western world, and maybe the weak Israelis, are in the best position to be able to say, "this war is against all of us." In the Middle East or in Spain, or other parts of the world, it stems from the same reasons... total intolerance to something which is different, and hatred to the values which all of us represent, and therefore we have to join forces together in fighting until we can destroy the sources of this war. All right David, it's good seeing you. Israel's Vice Prime Minister. Thank you for making it through the snow today. We appreciate that very much. Straight ahead: "It's Your World" spins on. John Kerry says it's not just global leaders urging him on, business leaders are too. But which leaders? We're going to have more on this topic, but first I... ...more strength to this economy, but maybe not for long. Some news on the housing sector you can't afford to miss, next. ...brought to you by Wachovia Securities, corporate and investment banking. What can glass teach us about corporate and investment banking? Success requires both strength and imagination. At Wachovia Securities, we learn from the world around us, because uncommon challenges call for uncommon wisdom. Wachovia Securities: corporate and investment banking. In a world where business can't make a move without a network, wouldn't it be great to have a network that can actually move your business? Because the right networking partner can do more than just move data, it can move people, products, an entire business floor. Now this is much later in the day. Mitzi has forgiven me. Oh Mitzi, have you? Yes, I think she has forgiven me. Benn is distracting her with his camera. That's why she's looking at Benn and not at me. And that's the problem in our conversation here. ...With Mitzi. Me and Mitzi. Mitzi. Yes, you forgive me. We are still... now I'm really... I'm going to marry you, not Maxie. It's okay. We are friends. The only disappointing thing I have to tell you, we have to wait until it becomes legal in New York State. Then we'll have a civil, you know, marriage. And, you know, I'm buying you a lot of food, you realize? I could have a tax deduction. Tax deduction... oh, sweet Mitzi. I don't care at all about tax deductions. We are still... What? What? Disappointed with humanity. I don't think it will end well. Things are going pretty badly. But we had a good night. All talking is nonsense, really, so it's better to sing. I don't know what my life is all about, and I suspect you don't know what your own life is all about. So we are about in the same boat, and we can all... drink to that... sad, happy, fat. We don't know, and it's of no importance to know what our lives are all about. It's of no importance at all. I don't know why humanity always wanted to know what this life is all about. It's totally unimportant. It is totally unimportant, because what is really, what is really, what is really important is to do the right thing that you feel is the right thing right here and now. And that is... that is maybe... the only important thing. You know, to do the right thing, here and now, the way you feel. That is, that you feel that is the right thing to do. Yes. That is the old fiddle. Now that I said what I had to say, I can drink my drink and not to worry about them. ...about... anything else, but the consequences. Only the consequences of what I said, and I believe what I said was right, was right. Call me a righteous person. Call me a conservative. Call me any name you want, but what I said I won't retrieve. I won't take back a single letter, not talking about syllables, but sentences. My friends, to you. We are here, at the Brooklyn Rail office ...office, office, yes. And we are toasting, of course, Brooklyn Rail. Welcome to the neighborhood, Jonas. - And Greenpoint, of course. - And Greenpoint, yeah. So we are here, at the end of Manhattan Avenue, almost by the East River, and here we are. It's February... maybe 20th? Yeah I think so. Two thousand and four. Now this is... now I can see the year. 1818. Life, Death and Immortality. - Night thoughts. - Yeah. I have a book which I am preparing called "My Night Life." It's my dreams. For one year I kept my dreams, my night... Oh this is... Come on, this is a... By whom is this? - Dr. Edward Young. - Edward Young, whoever he was. And this is all rhyme! This is no joke! "Then welcome, Death! "thy dreaded harbingers, "Age and Disease! Disease though long my guest..." This sounds amazing! This is like a... oratorium to death. Come, welcome, you, death! Disease and everything that is horrible, and come and embrace, I embrace you. "The guilty billows innocently roar, and the rough sailor passing, drops a tear." This is all about tears and dying and crying and... - That what it's about! - Yes! "Like soft smooth oil, "outblazing other fires? Can prayer, can praise avert it?" It's all a meditation on... this is amazing, this whole book. You know, when I found it I was so happy because... - It's 10 dollars. - Yeah. "Mark well, as foreign as these subjects seem, "What close connection ties them to my theme." It's all rhymed! "First, what is true ambition? "The pursuit of glory "nothing less than man can share. Were they as vain as gaudy-minded..." Gaudy-minded, never heard that expression. "Gaudy-minded... I think that this may be a forgotten masterpiece that you have discovered that may be no... And it was inscribed for the... Windham Library. In Vermont! Windham is in Vermont. Winham is not far from South Londonderry, Jonas. Yeah. There is no... That's why I was so happy. This, I'd say, it's something that you should really someday read. I want to. The reason why I was happy... And the review. I want to review this for the report of Brooklyn Rail. You want to? - A book to review from 1815. - That would be a brilliant idea. - Brilliant idea. - Actually... The only thing I know, Jonas, it was him who inspired William Blake to do a first illustrated book, after that book. This guy? You mean you found something about it? I know nothing, I never heard the name. I knew about him through William Blake. He loved him. So this guy... - Edward Young, inspired... - William Blake. He did the first illustrated book after his work. I see the, you know, the connection of this very, very, very, very deep, deep eternal seriousness that is in this in connection to Blake. I think you should review it. We should review it, right? You know who could review it for you? Robert Kelly. But my friends don't sing anymore. But my friends don't sing anymore. What speed. Walking along the sidewalk, walking along the Brooklyn sidewalk. As close as you can get to the water... We're good. Alright? - Now is only the beginning. - We're doing it. As long as we can maintain our own equilibrium. You hanging a right here? - Where's your car? - Right over there. Is this your car? - It's yellow. - Oh no. Not that big van. I wish. It's beautiful. It looks like there's somebody sleeping back there. Oh yeah. Look at that... Look at that, man. It's like a whole scene back there, man. Beautiful. It looks incredible. You could take that across the country, man. See you tomorrow, maybe? - Yeah. Yeah maybe with Matt. - I'll call you. It's 2:10... after midnight. Ah, the music... I can't sleep. I can't sleep. But the music is so beautiful. The music is so beautiful, I cannot... I cannot turn it off. I have to go to sleep. I cannot turn it off. The room. Dark. I have to sleep! I have to sleep! And I can't sleep. With music like this I cannot sleep it's 2:30 in the morning. I have to sleep. I have to sleep. Have to sleep.
