You choose! l think l need longer time to cure my illness, should get a job first. For interview! Have a seat over here for interview. You know French, ltalian and Japanese? l learn it for reading fashion magazines. You do nothing after working as a nurse for half year? Cause the clinic is located inside a big shopping mall. Not even reach the pay day, l had already spent all my money. l should consult the doctor first. Take a seat there for consultation. How long have you been unemployed? Three months. Financial status? Over spent in all the credit cards, more than twenty. also in debt with lots of personal loan. l should applying for a job first. Back to that seat for interview. But we're also located inside a big shopping mall. But you will cure my illness first? This is relevant to the doctor's issue, back to that seat. lt's not easy to cure your illness. lt should be better if you've a job. Am l serious? Yes! Will it affect my chance of employment? This is an interview question. Sure. lf you're better, it's easier for me to hire you. lf you hire me, it's easier for you to cure me. What about you wait for our decision. Can l sit here and wait? How about you consult the doctor first! l sit here and wait. How about you consult the doctor first! l wait here. Dr., will you hire her? Thinking. You better think it faster, l can't help you much longer. Why? Pre-mature delivery. Her amniotic fluid is leaking out. Wait for an ambulance on a couch. Which one should she sit? Take that one, able to see the coming ambulance! My delivery-bag is at home! Call up your hubby...tell him to take it to the hospital. My hubby is out of town, please take me home. Gimme your hand. lt's alright. Tell her that it's alright. lt's alright; it's alright... Ms Chow, where do you live? Sha Tau Kok. Sha Tau Kok? Buy it instead! Doctor, buying is faster than getting it from home! lt takes up lots of time to buy it again; it's far away to take it back. lt's much faster to buy it. The shopping mall is around the corner. You're wrong. He's much faster in taking it back. l forget that he is in sickness. Hold on; don't deliver here! l'll be back soon Super urgent! With or without wing, for day or night is also fine. Just grab any pack! Grab it, grab it! Napkins for parturient woman, diapers for new born baby. Gimme, gimme... Body wash products... Gimme, gimme... Gimme, gimme... Gimme, gimme...

Must shop for at least twenty to thirty bags! These are my favorite brands. l love to categorize the brands. l feel very happy when l see them. l finally locate the left foot! Only the right foot left over there! Why do you have so many chairs and fans? The electric bill is expensive from air-conditioning. Not wasting money by using fan! l live alone, so l don't need a loveseat or a love-chair. That's why l only buy single-chair! Do you shop in disorder currently? Sure! Shopaholic is caused by the low level of blood serum in brain. Such low level of blood serum in brain will lose control ability. l'll use medication to bring up her blood serum level... to enhance her self-control ability. Find a part-time, increase your income... less debt can ease up your emotional pressure... lt's better for your illness. You're quite good! Never see you before? l'm a part-time, my first day here. l'm sorry, boss. You're fired. You fire me. Do l still have employee discount?

My doctor is very good in healing shopaholic. l believe that we both are shopaholic. How much? Fifteen hundred for the first consultation, eight hundred for further visit. l won't, too expensive. Mr., you should cause you're sick. Too expensive, how could l? lf you don't mind l'm not a doctor, let me cure you... as if how my doctor cures me. As long as it's free. See me outside the coffee shop tomorrow at 1 pm. Bye bye! Excuse me boss, traffic jam. lt's your fault, cause me to buy the cabinet! Boss, guess we need a lorry. ls it free for a lorry? lf the car gets scratch, it'll end up spending money to fix it. How much for a lorry? About two hundred dollars... So expensive! Let's try it again. Boss, it gets scratch over here, be careful... Be careful...Here gets scratch too. Forget it! l don't want it. Trash it, only eight grand! l make the coffee and sandwich at home.

Scare of too cold in house A, fire in house B, ceiling collapse in house C. How should l help you? Expose therapy. Pick the most nonsense one and deal with it. After you finish dealing with it, you know it's only a nonsense. Ceiling collapse is the most nonsense one. Do you see any crack in the ceiling? No. Doctor, do you see the price tag? What price tag? l'm scared. l'm also scared. l wanna scream. l also wanna scream. Should be better after screaming out. Right, screaming out is better. Ghost again, ghost again...

The doctor says that proper encouragement can enhance the therapy. Take a look of how happy l'm! Do we have anything that hasn't been demolished since we bought it? Anything that hasn't been used since we demolished it? Anything that hasn't been re-used after we consumed it? We haven't demolished some old buildings since we bought them in Minden Ave., Wan Chai and Kwun Tong... We haven't rebuilt some since we demolished them in Sai Wan and North Point... We've two villas in Repulse Bay and Shek O... but we haven't used it for a long time. Stingy papa, is it ok to sell them all? Good, good...sell them all. After we sell all the old properties, land site and villas, we can cash in 123 billion dollars... plus we didn't buy that land at Barker Road... Now we have 200 billion dollars cash flow.
