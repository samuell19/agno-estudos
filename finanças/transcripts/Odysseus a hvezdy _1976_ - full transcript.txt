Pete, you know, you could have killed yourself? The model was fine. The error must be in the calculation. But... ...you could have been dead. if it wasn't for the grass, you'd be in pieces. You're lucky, you're living in the year 2000. 20 years ago. No one could put you back together. Don't, worry dad, maybe it needs to extend surface of the wings. Mom? Now we're gonna eat it up. Try to pretend a little bit. She's already called twice, but you were asleep. Better leave out those three transplanted teeth. - Hi, mom. - Hi. - Can he stand up? - Of course. Come on, lift yourself up. Leaving you with the boy, Misha,... ...is he whole? Totally whole. Don't worry, mom. Nothing is happening, mom. No? And what about that arm? Lift it up. No, no, no, sweetheart, the other one. No problem. I'll do a cartwheel if you want. or a handstand. Don't clown around. You should get your bottom smacked. And you will. I'll be down with you in three days, as soon as they relieve us. But, nothing is happening... Of course. Even if the house burns down. You two... Just when I leave you two alone for while... you're just worrying me. And what... Please excuse the malfunction. You two ..., even if the house burns down. ... ... Just when I leave you alone for while... Now you see ... Of course me. Like It was me jumping down from cliff. What the hell did you expect? That you'd fly up? Somebody's got to make it someday. You and your mom are trying, too, what no one's ever done before. Make the contact with an alien civilization What chance do you have with technology „PLEASE EXCUSE THE MALFUNCTION“? One to billion, right? Chance... Should I have told him that according to van Werner, there's virtually none... ...as well as his prototype, which unlike the model will never fly, because during calculation he forgot the relationship between increasing size and weight? And if someone rebut that truth, like so many scientific truths in last 25 years? Werner's skepticism - his numbers: The age of the oldest galaxy 10 billion years; distance of stars in the galaxy 7,5 million light years; probability of civilization on one star out of 4 million; average duration of the technical civilization is 6,500 years; optimal response time to our signal is 2,500 years. Yes. Let's say. But that's all true here, now in the year 2000. and it's our numbers, not theirs, these stars. I was probably only one, who had a proof. Only I was 12 at the time. It was '75 my father was building this house, and my tomcat Odysseus brought kittens, because he wasn't a tomcat, but a cat. Misha! Mishan! - We borrowed that battery, dad. - What battery? Well, the one from the motorcycle. We're trying something with the guys. You said, that Odysseus is tomcat. Ooh, he brought kittens. But he was fighting. But... ...look how cute they are. So it's a cat and have kittens. And what? They are so nice! Don't think, you are keeping them. House full of cats! Cats everywhere! I should kick out Odysseus just when you brought him. And put on shoes, don't run around barefoot and close the gate! And at evening I will check, if you watered grass. Hi. Allright. - How it's going? - Not bad. Look... ... yesterday this was whole sweater. Before my son borrowed it. And yours was there too. Said they are making some experiments at school. With acid from battery. We should go and check that school. Well, well. What with this? For the rock garden. Well, Hutka said you are building whole Karlstein there. And a pool for trained dolphin. With a water fountain. Give it here. And carefully. - the clutch slips. - Bye. Bye. I will talk with Misha. And we will split for that sweater. Are you crazy? I was going to throw it out anyway. - What's happening? - Nothing. Crap in diesel. I'll see you tonight at the festival. Hutka will hold the table for us. Kraus? Almost last... 500 koronas deductions for construction loan and 300 for the furniture. Here. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh yeah. Thanks. So tonight. Franta! Thanks. - You didn't have to rush it. - I'm borrowing, but I'm returning. - At seven. - Bye, at seven. Red kitten. Black kitten. You're a pretty kitty. I'll feed you. You're cute. Wait, come on. - Nice, yeah. - Hi. - Come here. Six kittens, man. I'll save one for you, you want it? But not this one. And this one. And this one either. Wait a sec. Hey ... - You are ours ... - Go to play somewhere else! Martin, ... ... at evening, ok? Sure. Parents will be out. Those are fish. They swim, you know? That's a doll. And this is Misha. Here's the bathroom ... ... and here's the water. Catch him! Watch out!| Go after him! To the right! - Hold him! - Handcuff him! They got him, mom. They're cuffing him now. The groom. Hello. No,he hasn't arrived yet. I'd rather not go. Every time we go somewhere... - You said at five. At five... ... it just didn't start. We tried everything. Spark plugs, cables, the distributor. And what about gasoline? - Here it is! - Hooray! - All right! - Oh, come here! Hi! - Faster! Come on! That's good. - Mischa, the gate. -Yeah. - Did you sprinkle the grass? - Yes, Dad. You want to see something? Matterhorn. - Dad, can I put it here between the cactuses? - Yeah. Matterhorn. And when you're going to wash yourself? Well, you just call the Mashkos, that we can't come get them. They've already called three times. - Isn't that the carburetor? - Not a speck. Misha, let's push. That's weird, me driving it, it always starts on the first try. When are you gonna get dressed? Don't spend the night in front of the TV. And no experiments! You know how it went last time. And don't go to the neighbors to a wedding. Do you understand? Yes, mom. Come on. Left, right. And good night. - Sleep tight. - Good night. We'll be back soon. Look how inaccurately passed ball ends up out of play. Kick to the visitors' goal. They're obviously and clearly waiting for the referee's whistle, to end the first half. Even a ball kicked out of play, and it shouldn't have been. The home team throws in... ...nice controlled action... Mishan! - You got it? - I got it. Wait, with that veil. stop playing with it. Have they seen us? Look. Nice! Let's go. Light is not on? - Rudla? ...it was said the window upstairs. Also was said, when it gets dark. I mean, this isn't dark. Or you're thinking, this is dark enough? Come on. - Ouch. - What was that? Rake. - You got a bump? - Don't worry. Watch out. - I'll have to return the battery tomorrow. - Never mind. We'll get another one. Honza promised me a 12-volt, discarded from the truck. Hey, they're almost new. My dad bought them a week ago. for my mom's radio. These, too. Are you watching? With 12-volt, it's gotta be broadcast all the way over the hill. All the way to the school. Imagine a very small speakers. like for a transistor radio. And when the test is due... Now. Turn it on! Turn it on. On. - Old hill, old hill... - Look at that. - ...how do you hear me? And not a word. But it connected. You could hear all the way over here. Maybe we invented something else entirely. Those batteries are totally trashed. Look. Oh, man... ... when we get that battery from the truck... Next time, get it yourself. Look how I look. New suit, cost six hundred. Just a stupid short circuit. Ooh, your calculations. - When my mom sees me... - What calculations? Katya! Just wait at home! Come on! Come on! Come on, let go! Not even a second. How old do you think you are? I'm sorry. Come on, Katya! - Bye. Bye. - Martin, tomorrow, ok? - What have you been drinking? - Griot. Just wait, you're gonna get slapped. Oh, there, look! Someone is there! There's nobody here. Who would be here? Why did you go outside? Don't worry. There. That was just plane from Brno. It's like it lost direction. Usually it flies over the hill. You know, a plane in the dark, can't see well. It's gonna be... Who was that? Nobody. Wet wires. Wet wires, when they get together... But there's someone here. Just wait! When I catch you! Don't step on it. Look. Now a second one. Not a word to parents. That we were out. No. But the rock... What rock? The one that was shining. No stone can shine. But this one does, on a rock garden. You've been imagining things. So what was shining then? The fireflies. It's like you've never seen fireflies. No stone can shine. What would glow in it? Just watch the fish. And home team again. They're thriving in the middle of the field, but in front of goal,where it's very crowded... - Now, you hear? ...don't go into the penalty box, and they take bad shots. It's the TV. I'll put the kittens in here if you want. I have to turn off the TV. By the way, the home team's headings are excellent. The score is still tied 1-1. Now the visitors are in action, but theirs... ...actions are too transparent... Easy for the home team to block... And this shouldn't happen. That was a bad throw-in. The referee is giving... The final league standings... Now they've got a chance. Goal. 2-1 - So the home side made it after all. They scored a goal before the end; they lead 2-1... And that's more promising. That's already in line with the predictions. There's a foul, and the referee orders a penalty kick... ... it's tied 2-2 and a surprising draw... ... is born. This is indeed unexpected. The visitors were focused on defense the whole time, and it was working... The fish said, you should go sleep to my room. Okay. But with kittens. OK, with kittens. But sleep now. Do you know what time it is? Can't you hear me sleeping? You know what else I saw? It's like someone's shining a big flashlight in the garden at the stars. - When. - When you went to the TV. Right there. It's dark in there now. By the rock garden? Kind of a colorful blinking. It was probably fireflies... ... and some have gone astray and flew into our TV. Now be quiet, please. Shh. No one's home right now. You know, they banned us to open the door. - Come here. - What's up? What's going on? Enjoy yourselves. But, unless you have a good reason, don't leave. They're looking for something. Probably. Extremely powerful power source. - See that battery? - From the motorcycle, right? Maybe a convict escaped, like they always do on TV. Or they're looking for a con man with the evil eyes. Or a lost child. - Be quiet. - I'm quiet. Because... ...so. Good evening. Mr. Kraus? - Yes. - We're very sorry. We're from airport technical services. We tried ringing the bell. That's useless. - It's just the kids at home. - Little kids? Girl 6, boy 12. And you, have you been tonight? Celebration of the construction company We'd like to see the garden and the house. Please, don't go into the garage just yet. Something wrong? Those are RDF cars, aren't they? - It's obvious you watch a lot of TV. - Can we? You'll have to excuse us, we're searching the entire area. We've picked up a source of interference, that could compromise air traffic safety. Hey, barberry! Berberis thunbergis? Variant. Berberis Thunbergii Atropurpurea Nice, nice. Maybe the son. - The son? - With the one next door; with Rudla Drnak from up there. They're always making some nonsense. Inventions. - Nice, huh? - It's okay. It's working. Crafty kid. Shh. - They're looking for convicts? Yes, mom? - No, sleep. You know what Ulysses did? He was climbing the curtains. And the bell was still ringing downstairs. - No one was there. And in the garden... - Who's Ulysses? - A cat... - Oh, I see. - ...sleep. Right, sleep. If it was a transmitter, it must have been an extremely powerful one. Some kind of power source. Probably unusual. atmospheric disturbance. Something that managed to momentarily disable all of the aircraft's instruments. Fortunately, only momentarily. 16 people on board. Regular line from Brno, huh. Well, no wonder you're searching everything. And it had to be around here somewhere, in these parts. That's what we've targeted There's still a cellar. There's still beer. Get the beer. - Wait, I'll get them for you. - Two more chairs. I don't want to see you with the boy next door anymore. - What were you guys doing last night? - Nothing, Dad. - But you must have done something. Who broke the balls on the fence? Come on, who broke the balls? Maybe Ulysses. - What about Ulysses? - The balls. He also spilled paint. Look at him. Have you seen the rock garden? Have you seen the rock garden? All the cactuses have bloomed. This is incredible. Like it's November already. Look... Look, we got an oreocereus blooming. Smell that. There was this other weird rock. The one you brought in yesterday, and now he's not here. Who would steal a rock? - What did I tell you? You're not gonna meet with that kid... - Always us... Go change. I'm gonna take one of the cactuses and show it to Vasek, so he can see what he gave me. He said they never bloom in the garden. Only in a greenhouse. Yeah, but he forgot, that the soil matters, too. You want to leave? They didn't say we couldn't leave. What's used for targeting? The coil? - Yeah, that, too. - And it's still spinning? You want some? - ... maybe with us. - Yeah, he's here. Regular line from Prague. Good. Airport, this is three, this is three. How it looks? Receiving. Maybe they'd be interested in the chrysanthemums. Cactuses, too. I had a nice chat with one of them yesterday. about berberis thumbergii. They'd be interested more, if you had a transmitter in the cellar. Look. Well. At least we won't be bored. Please calm down. Dad, they're behind us. We're not racing. The road is not a racetrack. And I'm not Niki Lauda or Clark. If they're liking to loiter behind us with a 613. That's cool car! Do you know who that was? Minister. Dad, where's the minister? There he is, where they're filming. Look at this. Oh, the guy with glasses? - Dad, where were you working yesterday? - Behind the embankment. - The rocks were from there? - Mm-hmm. Hey, don't think that today we're gonna be hauling some rocks. Damn, that cactus. And if anything, by the car. Mom, mom, I want to see dad! After a period of several months of heat. came unexpectedly persistent rains, causing catastrophic flooding. Tens of thousands of people had to to leave their homes. News from home. A new section of the highway, was opened today. Too bad you're black. You would have been in color yesterday. All circles, red and blue. and green and yellow. Don't make it up. She should be asleep by now, Mom. She's overtired. - I was too much for her today. - Mom, I don't want to. - We can't afford color TV. It's bad enough we have a colored cat. Go. There are fish waiting for you. and they're colored. You go, too. The movie has an asterisk. And don't stay up late, you're going to school tomorrow. - You got your homework? - Yes, mom. And don't forget to give Katya a snack. Line from Brno. See, he's flying right today. Over the hill. Hey, sleep! The boxes are leaving now. Everything's okay now. What are you doing? Munching on fish. I'm not slurping, I'm talking to them. About what? I talk to them every night. If you want, I'll tell them, to come to my hand. You stole the rock? I just borrowed it, so they could see it. It's a stone from the stars. - How do you know that? - They told me. You know what they're saying now? What's that? House? House? No. Maybe they don't even have any houses. Who? Well... Who? I don't know anymore. I was just doodling. How's it stomping? Maybe you'll be angry... but I banned Rudla effective immediately. to meet with your kid, and Martin too. Well, to have someone snooping through my house at night... - They were at my place, too. - Exactly. Transmitter. Well, I just want you to know. They found my Edison with earphones on... mumbling: "Here's the hill, here's the hill, can you hear me?" Luckily, you can't hear him around the corner with this thing, but what do you know what they're gonna do next? Well, what would you do as a kid? They'd keep meeting. Further from the house. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Get ahead of us. Rotten wood glows, too. Think, electric eel. will hit you, before you know. But this is a rock. Well, maybe we woke something up in that rock. Some kind of hidden radiation. Hey, it's calculable. exactly. We started broadcasting at ten and fried the batteries. That signal was really strong as hell. At ten past ten, a plane over the house. Then the light on the rock garden... And then the balls on the fence exploded. I found the veil on the pear tree, all the way up. What about the fireflies? Don't forget that; and Ulysses. - And you stay out of it. - Don't trip. Hey, and more mysteries: The doorbell rings and nobody's there; black and white television is suddenly in color; full of color nonsense. I can tell on you, too. All of it. What do you want to say? If you tell anything... Colored fires, Circles and rings, then the whistling, and around and around, colorful fires, circles and rings. We know exactly when it stopped transmitting. Oh, hey, here... ... a surprising tie. Two minutes before end of the game a goal from a penalty kick. - What's a penalty kick? - You stay out of it. Guys, space. - We need to find her a seat. -Hell, right up there in the front. Sit tight. You can look out the window, too. Oh, shit. Anyone in a hurry, move to the next bus. Is it my fault it's not running? Wait, there's another one behind me. I'll stop him. You're gonna change buses. Stop. Stop. Look, here. Hi. I'll send the little one over. Take her with you. Go, quick. - We're gonna be late for work. - Hi. And the rock garden? All the cactuses have bloomed. Maybe it's some hidden energy. Like in uranium. And all the chrysanthemums bloomed. But they bloom before winter. Oh, forget about the chyranthemums. - But if it's a meteorite... -So what? Then it must be black, black and insanely heavy. Not this one, it's more of a gray. I'll bring it this afternoon. I was gonna take it to school, but Katya kept hanging around the aquarium and... Don't run! Just wait, you're gonna get slapped. What about the rock? What did you want with the rock? - To show it. - To who? Michaela, Anita. and the teacher. You think those buses... and this... and Katya... Yeah. But not remotely. Only when the rock was close to the engine. Like on Saturday. You remember, when we pushed my dad's car? Before I carried that rock to the rock garden, it wasn't running. And after, it was. 46.7346 ÷ 5.82 That is not two bears and three bears... Bears are in the first grade program. I said: "Don't touch the switches." Or we stop this experiment. and go back to class. - Have you read Lord of the World? - I haven't. In it, some mad scientist has crippled all the traffic. Cars, trains... ...planes were falling to the ground like plums. - Really? - Now you. Now watch. It only works up close. Oh, wait, butterflies, and what? Butterflies. Please, what, what do you want with the butterflies? What do you want butterflies for? Have you ever been here? Have you ever been here at all? Yay. Cool, right? Another long period in history. of our Earth's history was the Mesozoic Era. - By that time, life was already ... - Martin, come on. ... and the Mesozoic is a period of development of the plant and animal species... ... a sort of middle period of the evolution of life on Earth. At the beginning of the Mesozoic Era. ...still reverberated the geologic processes of the Paleozoic... ... then there was a certain calm. and the middle period is more of a time of slower and fluctuating movements, ...during which landmasses form. We divide the Mesozoic into 3 periods. Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. The Triassic lasted about 40 million years, the Jurassic 45 million and the Cretaceous around 70 million years. And by the end of the first part of the Mesozoic there is mountain-building activity in the Mediterranean region. 150 million years ago. a large number of volcanoes were formed... - The most violent movements took place at the end of the Jurassic period... - 150 million years ago? Was anyone there at all? Mountain ranges in Central and East Asia... In Manchuria, Zabaikal, China, Turkistan, and elsewhere. The lava was spilling over the surface. in large outpourings. - Maybe the rock... - ...Earth... - ...especially... - Maybe we woke it up with our transmissions... to send a message. Um, from the Paleozoic. Holy crap. And just to you. Here, take it. What if... the message isn't a rock? What if the message is in it? Like in The signals from Vega 3. Imagine, that someone sends a million years ago thousands of probes to every corner of the universe and is waiting for someone to answer him. - Who? - Us. - Somebody. - Another planet with life on it. But it was prehistoric here. Volcanoes. Even where they're building highways now. It won't budge. Like the colored dots and dashes. Maybe they expected us to understand them. The ones from 180 million years ago? Where are they now? And if so, what did they turn into? Maybe they look like flowers? - Or trees, - In one book, there was a star with trees on it. At night, they'd go and strangle intruders with their branches. - Bullshit. - Why bullshit? They might as well live in the oceans like fish. Or dolphins. Or fly. Flow like water. Why not trees? Hehe, like trees, haha. Oh, hey. Katya can talk to fish. We can ask her. That's funny that she said first: "It's a stone from the stars." That they're coming for it. - We gotta try. - Gimme. Nothing. - Oh, it's quarter past four. Dad's gonna kill me. - Get the bags! Hey, guys... Don't touch that. But why? Um, what if it's... What? What if...? That's nonsense. It's nonsense. Nonsense. Surely the rock hasn't been waiting in the ground for millions of years, to kill a few fish in a fish tank? No rock can be that evil. This one is. Throw it away. I don't have it anymore. Katya, go sleep at mom's tonight. You're gonna say your stomach hurts. If you don't tell her anything, I'll buy you some more fish tomorrow. - Better. - But they're not going to be better. Katya. - Katya. - But you will buy me a lot of them. ... of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic especially in machine tools, electronics, agricultural and textile machinery automotive and consumer products. The event is intended to help expand economic relations with France. At a rally in support of the struggle of the Chilean people. gathered representatives of 42 youth organizations from around the world to protest against cruelty and inhumane treatment. Today, in a historic snapshot of the event of the century we are commemorating the first meeting of Soviet and American cosmonauts in space. Magnesite plants in Lubenik and Warsaw. were visited on Thursday by participants of the of the plenary session of the Standing Committee - of the COMECON ... iron. - Look how you look. - Why are you wandering around, when you're a cat and you have kittens? - Secretary General... United Nations Kurt Waldheim left New York on Friday. for a several-day visit to the Middle East. What's up, Martin? You can go back to sleep. Nothing. Nothing at all. Only Ulysses is back. He's all painted, all the way behind the ears. Yeah, man... I thought about that, too, what if they never call again. In the Death Spiral, there was a spaceship flying to the stars for a thousand of years. Unless they could use time like in the 4th dimension. What? You didn't read it? I'm gonna borrow it to you tomorrow, so bye, and good night. ...the cause of the crash was a flock of birds, that the plane crashed into shortly after takeoff. Sulfur deposits are estimated at 150 million tons in Poland. Since 1961, its production has been steadily increasing and today Poland occupies in sulphur production... Martin, What are you doing? Do you know what time it is? I know. Now listen. The marble that was, is no more. It's transparent and floating in space. First the TV went off. and then... Now it's rolling. Listen to this. It's absorbing the chair into itself. Now it's sent beams towards the chair. Martin. What are you doing here? Stop! Well, get in the car, sweethearts. You'll get it at home Well, go, go. Get in. Don't be suprprised if engine fails. Well, well, well... ...let's say that in the Paleozoic. a probe from an alien world landed on our planet. And let's suppose that during the blast. of another stretch of highway... ...has come to the surface, - In the stone. - ...in that rock, and that it was stopping cars, right. And when you started broadcasting, the probe relayed the information... ... and black and white television... ...started playing in color. Yes, well, you see. And then the ball grew, grew... ... until it was as big as a house, and it's like... ...the rays measured everything inside... ...the cat, the trees... ...moths,... ...and then it rolled across the landscape... ... and it was broadcasting a message again to some... ... alien planet and then it was small again. But why call the Academy of Sciences right away? - Well, we have evidence. - Sure, here, the, the marble, right? First it was stopping cars, but now it doesn't. It used to be big, and now it's small. - Other way around. - Yeah, other way around. You're right. It was small at first... ...then big and... ...now it's small again. So you guys sure read this, huh? Death spiral. 4 MX... ...in action. There's the cat. In Secret of the black sphere is Paleozoic, and here we have... ...the aliens landing and they'll have... ...instead of ears those, those... ... antennas. You know what? Take the marble; come on, and go to sleep. And be glad, that we're not reporting this to the school. Leave the sweaters and the jacket here. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. Good night. But the sphere... ... What about the RDF vehicles? And the fish? Bye. And hurry home. But the moths... ...died just like the fish. - And Ulysses... - There he is. Nothing happened to him. Hey, did you read about Quasars? The secret of the black hole. The mystery of antimatter. Well, if you didn't, then, stop by. Okay, bye. Well, there you go. You were in that ball, the rays measured you... ... and still no one believes us. Knowing what you know... What's that? The year 2000, how we imagined it. As a kid, I believed a lot of nonsense, that every man has a star, even cats. Ulysses came through this window. It was just smaller, before we remodeled the house. What happened to him? With Ulysses? He died. I was 15 by then. He still had a lot of kittens... ... and the kittens have kittens again... ... and you have one of them. - A Paw? - Mm-hmm. - Where is he? And the boys? Rudla was killed... ...on a research flight. You know Martin, he works with me. Katya's still studying fish talk. She's even getting good at it. She's half fish. I'd investigate the marble. You can. For sure. It's over there on the desk as a paperweight. We cut it in half in the lab once. Nothing. A simple metal ball. The adults were probably right. A cluster of coincidences, an overabundance of imagination. We combined things, that didn't seem to belong together. The only one that makes sense is this one. Katya's scribble. I put it into the computers once. and they said it was a star map... ...as seen from some planet around the stars... ... Theta-Ceti and Epsilon-Eridani. And they also wrote: "Very old, estimated to be 150 to 200 million years old." This is us, a globe in space. But that means... I'm sorry, they're calling me. - Now, at night? - Maybe Mom. Misha, are you sleeping, or what? Turn on the video. Man, that sphere must have come back. It landed a few kilometers away, where we saw it as kids. I sent you a helicopter. Get in it, even in pajamas. That was Talin. Now you're gonna see a telefilm from the Rocky Mountains Observatory. Approximately in the middle of the screen. a bright spot will appear in a few seconds. Attention. Now. As you know, the unknown object has landed in the meantime. Before we can get at least a basic visual link, technical information. No radiation, no signals. Still, the recon team is advancing... ...with the utmost caution. This is studio Prague, this is Prague. We are approximately 1,000 meters from the object. The second site is a little closer, but the view is narrowed by the edge of the forest. Third camera is advancing. with the recon team. Switching over. We're just outside the object. From a distance, it resembles a luminous circle, but up close, it's shaped like a sphere. I see something there. I see something there. Camera, close-up, close-up. Attention. There's life inside. Something that resembles to an extinct species of nocturnal lichen, that lived on Earth just 30 years ago. Paw! Are you there, Dad? If not, maybe you can hear me on the recording. Are you there, Dad? If not, maybe you can hear me on the recording. Listen carefully. You'll hear Ulysses, too. You will hear Ulysses. Now. That's him. There's a green smudge on his neck. from the paint, just like back then. His heart's even beating. You were right. Those from the stars are looking for a connection with the stars, with the life. That's why they sent Ulysses. A copy of him. The highest life form they could find here, to talk with us. Dad, Are we a planet of moths and cats? Dad, they came back to us. Someone needs to tell them it's a terrible mistake. That we humans are here. That we want to talk to them, too. To understand, that we, too... ...that we, too... ... that we too are looking for our own way to the stars. This is Earth. You from the stars, how do you hear us? There's a human. There's a human. There's a human!
