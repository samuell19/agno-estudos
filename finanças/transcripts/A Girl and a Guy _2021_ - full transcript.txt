- Watch it! - You watch it! What took you so long? The noodles are cold now. I'm sorry. The production meeting was hectic. But I brought chocolate cake. Your favorite. Thank you. But seeing you is all I need. You know that, right? Turn that TV off. - It's my birthday. - Stop. That's not my movie anymore! It's so bad! It looks like we didn't have enough footage. It's nonsense. Can we not go with your style, just this once? Maybe we can do what Professor Suarez likes instead? Because I'm sure he will like this cut. You know him, right? Because what matters right now is that we get good grades. Never mind, I'm just gonna make my own version. That's fine! Edit it however you like. You can release that when I've made you famous. You're gonna make me famous? - Yes! Just trust me! Yes! - Are you sure? And when you're famous, whatever kind of film you want, we'll make it happen. I'm here to support you, you know that, right? It's rush hour. Traffic is bad. And I almost got lost. I had to make a U-turn. Plus, the client was late. They really loved the decks that I submitted. Especially the client. They even hinted at offering me a job. I thought you said you were gonna quit your job? Hon, I work for my godmother. I can't do that to my mom. By the way, why did you pick this place? You said you wanted to try the steak here. But, hon, it's still a few days away from payday. I'm almost out. And I was supposed to get some cash but the ATM was offline. You're loaded? - I'm really excited. - Are you ready to order? That's 4-1. I don't want a rematch. - It's over. - You're a cheater! Okay, game. - I don't know. - You can do it. I really don't know. Come on, you know that. I'll give you a reward. What reward? - If you get these flashcards perfectly. - If? There's a QCinema film camp next week. - In Manila? - Yes. I told you about that, remember? We can hitch a ride with Dad. - Huh? - He goes there every week. My dad. Film camp? How long will that be? Two weeks! Come on, don't you want that? We'll have more time together. How will you fit that in your busy schedule? Don't be negative. Come on, you don't want to go? We still want to do this, right? What's up? Have you taken Hiro to the vet? Not yet. Your phone bill, that was due Monday, right? Have you paid it yet? I'll do it later. It's your mom's birthday next week. Did you get her anything? Trix. This is a new one. What happened? Scalded. From boiling water. Are you still understaffed? As usual. Is that so? You're tired? I know. I'll relieve your stress. Trix, it's like you don't know me at all. You haven't changed at all. This is how I am. That's still your excuse? I have to do everything for you, your calendar, even your decks at work! You don't even have your own credit card. No insurance. Two years, Gio. We've been delaying our plans for two years. You've burned your hands so many times making noodles. When are you going to stop? Fi, you know my parents need me there. They're having a really hard time. You think I don't know that? They're your family, - Of course you love them. - Then you know... I know! I know how much they need you... Fi, what if we don't want the same things anymore? What if I'm no longer the Gio that you used to know? The problem is, you always want to have it your way. Gio, hold on. Hold on. Gio. It's fine, we don't have to go to the camp! We can put it off till next year. I'm not going! It's fine! Just go ahead with your film camp! Fi, can't you do anything without me? Do I have to be there beside you all the time? Trix, where is this coming from? You have no direction. Okay, I'll pay my bills. I'll get a vet appointment for Hiro. And I'll get a gift for my mom tomorrow. And I'll work on my decks. Please tell me... that you love me. I love you. But... But what? What is it? Tell me, Gio! - Nothing! Stop it! - Tell me! You're insecure? Tell me! Tell me the truth because I can't tell what's going on in your head! You're threatened because I'm better than you, is that it? - Shut up! - I thought you're a film director? Stop! - What happened to Gio... - Stop it! ...the first Filipino Oscar winner? Trix, I don't know what you want from me. Are you giving up? Are you giving up? Fuck you! Trix. Like an opponent's left hook that hits you out of nowhere. Countless spinning elbows. A never-ending guillotine choke. The ground feels so unsteady. Very unstable. With each step you take, you could fall any moment into a deep, dark pit. This isn't just a knock out. This is a 99-hit combo. In movies, you can create many different stories. You can become different people. There are so many things I want to do. So many things I want to become. Not just in movies, but in real life. But many times, Son, get up. It's late. Your room is so messy. Get up. - Ma! - Your clothes are everywhere! Come on, get up! Have breakfast upstairs. Hiro. Denim jacket. Over easy eggs. Burned hot dogs. Worn-out underwear. Hot coffee gone cold. Guitar. This is a recap of the Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao data in different days. Raf. Get some water. Hi, Auntie. What was that? What happened to your nice decks? I'm sorry. Don't be too harsh, it was just a few grammatical errors. A few errors? You were missing three slides, plus your first slide said, "Thank you." And you're late, so I had to fix it myself. Be thankful that I'm covering for you. Thank you. Raf, how are you doing? I'm okay. Are you? You're not getting back together with her? You know, boss, when it's over, it's over. - You're sure? - Of course. How many times do I have to tell you? Don't do it like that! I don't want to deal with that agency! When are you going to learn? Here's your coffee. What do you want? I wanted to ask you about the lamp shade before you leave... - Have you picked which one to use? - Yes, the yellow one! The mustard yellow! I'll take care of it. I'll have it fetched from storage. Okay, thank you! My God! What took you so long? Hi! The Queen of Spotlight. How are you, my friend? I knew that was your voice! Of course! How are you? - Are the rumors true? - Yes? That your agency is closing down? One for admin, one for accounting, and another for creatives. Please have them ready so we can route them today. Have you submitted the storyboards? Yes, Miss Marga, I've sent them via email. It's better to have a hard copy. Make it colored. - Then distribute it to the staff. - Will do, miss. Don't forget to update the talents with their call time. I've updated them, Miss Marga. That's done. - By the way... - Yes. Next time don't go straight to the director. I am your direct superior. This is you. This is me. This is the director. Never skip. I'm sorry. Miss Marga, about the lampshades, I'm not sure which one to get. Come, let me see them. This looks nice. I love it. With diamonds. Nice. This is nice. Cute ornaments. Right? This is perfect too. So which one should I bring? Just bring all of them to the shoot tomorrow. Wake up. It's painful enough to think you were headed somewhere, but you were wrong. You wagered on your five years, but it was a losing bet. Would you continue enduring the pain just to reminisce? Come on, let's go to lunch. Yeah, I'll be right there. Okay. Hey, let's go have lunch. Are you okay? It's nothing. Just go ahead, I'll have to finish some stuff first. - Are you sure? - Yes, go. - I'll get you some food. - Okay, just go ahead. Okay. It's just a boy! Three weeks? Where are you gonna find a replacement? It's almost the holidays. That's peak season. Miss Marga, I know some people who can freelance. I can refer them. Please. Referral? You think this is networking? I'll need to train whoever... Boss, you'll really let her take a vacation? Marga... look at her. Does that look like a productive employee? However you put it, if you're broken, then you're broken. Broken. You got your ticket? You got it? Yes. Fiona, there's a lot of things you need to learn if you want to be successful in this industry. A lot of things. Set them aside. - You have to put them in the right place. - Put them in the right place. Hold on. She's a candidate for Production Manager, right? Come here. Here you go. Good boy. Donsol, Siquijor, Palawan. Those bastards! I hope you enjoyed your stay. I did. Very much so. Aren't you going to wait for Diego, ma'am? He should be coming back soon from island hopping. No need. And you don't need to tell him that I've left, okay? Okay, ma'am. Take care. You can't fake it! You can't even see the brand name! But the hot dog is big, right? We can make it bigger if you like. I know you just don't want to give comments because it'll be a ton of work for you, Raf. And for you. As you said, the timetable for this is very tight. I don't mind moving the timetable, just don't submit this ad. I'm not showing this to MSC or to Miss Jen. Yuck. Boobs and hot dog? That's what you're always thinking about. How is this my fault? This isn't my concept. You, you men. Here we go again with "not all men." I'm just saying, that's not how I think. I like the ad, but not because the girls are sexy. Really, you'll still like it even if it's not sexy? Sure. Plump, slim, boobs, butt, big or small, why not? What if that's MSC? Mela! That's my godmother! Oh, really? How about Miss Jen? How about Miss Evelyn? I guess. How about Merly? Isn't she a guy? How about me? Yeah, sure. Of course. Wow, Raf. You just came out of a breakup. Don't be too obvious. You game? Go! Mela! Mela! Mela! Loser! Loser! Loser! No! I really don't drink! Auntie, they're making a fool of me! - What should I do? - I've got you covered. I really don't drink. Come on! It's over! He's done! I'm gonna report you to your mom! She won't know if you don't snitch. Wait, this isn't my car. I can take care of myself. You're right. I can't take care of myself. Drink some water. There's one right there. Nice. You're so yummy, boss. What did you say? I really like it that you're my boss. I haven't taken my dog to the vet. Hiro! And... I forgot to get my mom a gift for her birthday last week. I have a lot of office work that I haven't done... Raf... Miss Mela, I've submitted the report. I just want to remind you of your meeting later. The decks are ready. Do you need me to prepare anything else? The sales department needs your answer today. We really need to get back to them. They've been calling all day. I'm running out of excuses. Sure, ma'am. When? And my boyfriend has football practice. Put that in your calendar. We can go to my house, if you want. Won't your mom notice? It's safe. She might tell your godmother. By the way, next time can you use a condom? No way. Fuck. Such a hassle. Yes, that's it. Just put it on top. Just leave it on my desk, okay? Hold on, just a second. What was it again, sorry? What took you so long? Can we switch seats? Why? I'm left-handed, so it might be easier to eat... - I mean... Is that okay? - Okay. Welcome. May I take your order? Thank you. It's okay. Everything here's really good. If there are a lot of options, it's hard to pick. Sorry. By the way, for the decks that we need tomorrow... This is so pretty. Isn't it? She'll be working under you. Stay here. Stay, please. - Raf, what are you doing? - Please? - Stay with me. - We've been here for a while. Oh, my God, we're supposed to be quick, right? Where are you going anyway? My boyfriend. - Boyfriend? - I'll see you in the office later, okay? Make sure you show up. Again? Can't you just stay here? You know the answer to that, Raf. Later, I'll see you there. Hi! I'm done with the deck. Where should I send it? Relax, wait till Friday. I finished it yesterday. Come over and let's talk about it. I don't think that's appropriate, sir. Just kidding. I need to cut our budget. Can we have packed lunch since we're moving to the next location right away? No! Fiona! Have you sent it to the caster? The colors are ugly! Will she be ready in 15 minutes? Manage the fees for the crew and negotiate their rates, okay? I don't want any latecomers. We need gas for the vans. - Did you tell the drivers? - Yes. - We'll change location by 6:00 p.m. - Okay, we're ready. Guys, can you help me move these? Okay. Thank you. Belle, can we have the room, please? I'm proud of your growth, Fi. I really am. I believe you'll do well handling your own team. I'm giving this job my best. You're doing great. You don't even need me anymore. Don't say that. But are you really assigning those newbies under my supervision? Can't you give me anyone else? You have to give them time. Everyone starts from the bottom. Like we did. But I want to ask you something, Fiona. - You mean as a producer? - Yes. I just think, I've been here for a while. I'm working my way up. I see. How about you? Do you want me to leave you here? You need me around, don't you? Okay, just make sure that when you get your next paycheck, change your wardrobe. - Is it bad? - It's bad. I'm sorry. I know just what to get. I've been looking at your style. - I noticed. - I'll do that then. How long will that take? This one will take a while. Will it be ready today? Yes, sir. - Belle. - What? You did something wrong. What? I'm not doing anything! Where are you sitting? - Sorry. - What did I say? - Yeah. All right. - Always on the left. Yes, ma'am. Always on the left. Guess what? I got the approval! - Congrats! - Thank you. Is that so? When are you leaving? But I'll file the final week as vacation. Why? When do you start at Quantum Films? That soon? - I'm excited. - Excited to get out of here. How about you? What are you waiting for? Why don't you come with me? Hey, no poaching! You know, I just got promoted. I don't want to give that up. You're not going to do film anymore? I'll do film. Eventually. But right now, I'm happy here. I'm enjoying my work. Isn't it obvious? - You sure? - Yes! I know what you're thinking. This has nothing to do with Gio? - Gio, again? - Yes or no? No! - You've moved on? - It's been a long time. I'm just excited for you. Me too! About the presentation, did they comment yet? We need the final revisions for the next meeting. I'll take care of it. How was your dental appointment? Also, did you get your mom a gift? Why? No. I was just waiting for Andrew. We have a thing. I thought it was my turn today? Raf, it's Friday. Fix your own calendar. If your direction is a simple point A to point B, or point A to point R to K or even ZYXW, you will get what you want if you want it bad enough. I want you, and her, In the past, intimacy precedes sex. You were late on the 13th, then absent on the 16th. The next day you were late again. What are we gonna do about that? You know what you can do to fix that? I'm serious! But things are different now. Can you send that to Mela tomorrow? Three decks, we need those tomorrow. Come on, Kath. And make sure you cascade the ad to everyone. Sir, hold on. I didn't get the last part. Can you repeat that? - Sorry, sir. - Let's go. Hey, guys! It's Kath's last day on Friday! Don't remind me! No one's gonna leave good morning notes anymore. I'll contact you, one by one, through Facebook. Actually, the one who'll miss Kath the most is Raf. Because no one's gonna do his decks anymore. Is that so? But to be fair, you two look good together. She's blushing! Stop it! Just drink! I'll get more drinks. Your cologne's too strong. Get Kath drunk! Guys! Cut it out! Guys, listen to me! I'm a gymnast! Do it! Cartwheel! One, two... One... You count! I'm a gymnast! Bye! Take care! All right, take care. Drive safe. Where are we going? I'll drive you home, okay? I'm driving you home. I can't do that, sir! Why? My parents are strict. Sir, I'm really happy with my experience here. I learned a lot from you. You're a great mentor. I'm gonna miss you so much. Hey, wait for us! - I'm gonna miss you, sir. - Kath. What is this? Kath, you're drunk. Who's drunk? You? I'm not drunk! Kath! What are you doing? Oh, my God, it's huge! - This one. Left. - No, don't. You don't like that? This one has abs. If you like it, swipe up. Yes! A match! You have a pretty smile. Thank you. When I look in your eyes, it's like, we connect, you know? Right? See? Oh, my God! Hold on, I'm nervous. Don't be. It's okay. For me this is my fourth... What do you usually like to do? - I like hiking. - Really? I love nature. How many siblings do you have? - None. It's just me. - Me too. Isn't it hard? I was craving steak. Anything beef will do. Try the ribeye steak. Is it good? Here? Cooked in butter, with herbs, and... I didn't know you smoked. I mean, go ahead. Do your thing. Right? Oh, my God. I'm really having fun right now. Maybe it's you or maybe it's the drinks. Stop teasing me. Or else, I might start falling and get too attached to you. Keep persevering. You studied film, right? What are your favorite movies? - For me, my top three movies... - Let's hear it. Here. My top film, And of course, What a list. - All right. - You'll do it? Of course. I'm a gentleman. To get what you want. But in the end, is that really what you want? Or have you changed to the point that you've forgotten the things you truly want. Anyway, my advice is just go for it. Just enjoy it, Fiona. Sorry, did I do something wrong? No, it's just... You're a really good kisser, but I feel like... I think the alcohol went to my head. So you're really a good boy? Did you like it? It was a nice four-course meal. Fuck, what are you doing? Fucking pig! Son of a bitch! Excuse me. Is Gio around? Sorry, ma'am. He already left for Manila. Rape? Are you serious right now, Mela? What would you say that was, Raf? You might get fired. Worse, she might get you jailed! - She made the first move. - She can't remember anything. Because she was drunk! You were drunk. Everyone was drunk! Raf, she said you covered her mouth - so she wouldn't scream. - Because she was laughing a lot! See, she remembers that. So she does remember something! You know me, Mela. A rapist? Are you serious? You know what, Raf? I want to believe you. That's why I'm talking to you, so we can clarify things. Here's what happened. What happened was... She was drunk, Why did you take advantage? You didn't ask. Did you ask? Why did you do it? That doesn't sound like you. You're not like that, Raf. What do you want me to say? That I was jealous of you? There, I was jealous of you! I said it. Does MSC know? This is workplace harassment. Damn it, Mela. That's exactly what you do! - That's what we do! - Fuck! Hold it! - What is this? - We had consent. We're on equal footing. - We had an agreement. - Equal footing my ass! Let's stop it. We've been doing it for a year, Mela. Damn it! I know I shouldn't have done it with Kath! But I thought it was fine because you had your Andrew! Why now? How have you been? I just remembered you. It's been a while since I had noodles. I dropped by your place. Your mom said you're gonna be a director? What happened? I thought... I thought you were going to handle the family business. I thought... I thought you were satisfied here. Why didn't you tell me that I was the problem? It's me, isn't it? Fuck, Gio! You should've just said you didn't love me anymore! Fuck, Gio! That was it, you didn't love me. I wasted all my time, that wasn't enough? Fuck, you wasted everything! I supported you. I was there for you all the way! But it looks like it didn't matter. You won't find anyone like me. No. I'll tell her. Raf, tell me! What do you want to do? What do you want to do, Raf? I don't know. Tell me, Raf. What do you want? Raf? Get some more drinks! Go get some more. - Happy birthday! - I'm glad you made it! Thank you! Enjoy the food! - Dumbass! - You wanna mess with me? Hey! It's my birthday! Cut it out! Stop it! Fucking idiot! Belle! I've been looking for you! It's been a long time! What have you been doing? I'm now working in television! Really, congrats! I'm so happy for you. We're doing a location shoot here. Yeah, thanks for coming. What have you been doing? Still at Spotlight. Same old me. They should give you a loyalty award. Nothing wrong with being loyal. It's fine. Have you heard from the gang? Are you seeing anyone? That's not for me! I'm still single. You've heard about Diane? She's getting married! - Wow, that's nice. - She's lucky. She's got a German "sausage" for a fiancé. - What else? - How about Leo? What about him? Get this... He finally came out! He's teaching at the university. Good for him. How about Gio, have you heard? Remember Gio? He got into QCinema! He's so good, right? Great! I'll just check on the guests. Get some more beer. Sure, go ahead. I paid for that. Me. No kidding. We should just enjoy this. Let's just chill out. Birthdays are really hard. You have to look happy. You should have seen me earlier. I was okay. But sometimes, it will just hit you. As you grow older, things just get worse and worse. - I swear. - That's why I don't want to grow old. I really don't want to grow old. Just relax. Don't worry about it. Right, that's what I said. I don't know... You know that feeling when... you take your mind off of something for a moment, then someone overtakes and grabs it from you? Just like that. Someone's taken what's supposed to be yours. That feeling when everyone's moving on. When you haven't done anything right. When you worked your whole life to go down the path you've always wanted, then you realize you're still there and you've never moved at all. You know what I'm saying? We all get stuck at some point. I just wish that the world would stop. That everything would just stop. Everything. So that I could somehow catch up. What do you think? We don't really need to be in a rush. It's not too late. A lot of things can still happen. There's a lot you can still change. I think I've seen you before. Have we met before? Don't worry about it. I probably look like every other drunk guy you've met before. Forgive me, I'm just drunk. - You're drunk? - Don't listen to me. - You're drunk? - Or anything I say. No, you have some sense for someone drunk. I'm just not sure if you have any sense when you're sober. I'll call you when I'm sober. Number? Well, someone's in a rush. Really? I just met you. It's fine, I guess. But maybe not. I might get disappointed. I've been there. For sure. Hi Fiona. I think you recognize me from here. Hi, Raf. What are you doing on Tinder? Everyone's here, right? Those that are single and ready to mingle. And you believe that? I don't know. I feel like... I'm giving up on this. Don't delete it yet. Wait until after we meet. Your dog? Hiro says I make a lot of sense. Right, baby? We always talk, right? Hiro asks if you can meet him at the park. This weekend? Stay safe everyone, please. It's like a zombie apocalypse. Yeah. What should we do? Yes. I feel like I'm in a marathon. Though the finish line is still far away, that's fine as long as I'm moving. But I can't keep taking my time or I'll get left behind. What matters is that I have one direction, Not because I'm philosophical, but... They say it's all part of the journey. Who knows where we might end up? Is there still a future? We're gonna live off of canned goods. Those who don't get eaten by zombies will turn into cannibals to survive. You can't just lose it. You just need to get back to it. Why? I feel the same way. I'm also really nervous about writing. - Really? - Yeah. But I think now is the time. I hope you're a better writer than you are a baker. I'm sorry. Did I offend you? - No. - It's just my mom is a great baker. No, it's fine. It's fine. Life is short, so at least I know that as early as now. Are these movies or video games? I'm sorry. That's all I have. But... Hey, I've sent you my script. Please read it. - Yes. - And let me know what you think, okay? Isn't this nice? Fiona! What are you doing there? - Sorry, I didn't... - Over here. That's off-limits. That customer calls nonstop. We've serviced them several times but she keeps complaining. - The two of us will be working here. - Okay. I'll be at this desk, and you're over there. - List down the supplies you need. - Okay. How's everything, Jerry? Carlo, sir, this is Fiona, my niece. I got her as a temp while Reggie is on maternity leave. Hello, sir. - The phone. - Sorry. Hello. Yes. Yes, I'll take note of that. Thank you so much. Yes. Thank you. And those water stains, make sure you clean those too. - All right? Thank you. - Okay. And, Kat, please wash all the glassware and the remaining cookware in the kitchen. And make sure they're all ready for use. - Okay. - Thank you. Hi. Sorry for the wait. Wait, I know why you look familiar. Did we have a class together in college? - Right? - Yeah, I think so. - I think I remember you. - Yeah. I'm really sorry about the mix-up in the last Zoom meeting. I wasn't able to fly back so my associates had to cover for me. You know, I really like your original designs. I'm out. I've gotten used to being alone. What are you doing? And she has a key to the house, so she just comes and goes. And when we're married, Stepmom? Me? Fi, do you think I bring women home for no reason? Raf! No! What are you doing? Didn't you see the video about the sea turtle with the straw in its nose? How pitiful. Try it with ketchup. That's banana ketchup, it's good. - How is it? - Not bad. It's good, right? It has soy protein, chickpeas, spices. It's complete and healthy. If they'll just recreate the taste of meat, then what's the point of going vegan? Do you remember that ad by Quick Delights? The one that goes, "You can't fake it?" You can't fake it. You know, I never got that ad. My business partner and I were looking for a space here We can't. We're doing everything else. But I'm still a virgin, right? I'm sorry. You can do whatever you want with me when we're married. Really? You know I love you so much, right? Raf... Hi, welcome. Come in, please. Don't be nervous. Let's go. Hi, sir. How are you? Good morning. Hi, madame. Good morning. Okay, Ma. We'll come back later. Come, I'll introduce you to my friends. You'll like them. Hi, how are you? How's everything? Do you like the food? Let's take a picture later. If you want more food, just go and order, okay? Can you pass me the watercress? - Thanks. - Sure, Uncle. Hold on. - Try this. - Brown rice? - This is good. - Let's try this at home. - Can I have some barbecue? - Sure. This is good. Barbecue, really, Dad? Just kidding. I like the veggies better. This is my favorite. Here, Dad. Get some more. - I love salad! - Get more salad. I think a garden wedding would be nice. I like that idea. Let's get the bishop to officiate. You notice something different? So that's why you disappeared. And... he's the only one my parents liked. So you'll be a stepmom at the age of 27. I think it would ground me. What about your film? I don't have the time. Carlo's too busy. He has a bunch of businesses. Hold on. Is this an interrogation? You're also getting married, right? Don't put the spotlight on me. How's that going, anyway? That's her, isn't it? That's her. You had a fight, that's why you're in a bad mood. Admit it. I didn't propose. I'm not ready. I haven't proven anything to myself. How about you? Are you sure you're ready? What's that supposed to mean? If you have a problem, Raf, don't pass it on to me. You don't know me. Has he seen you when you haven't taken a bath for a week? - Wait, what? - I'll find someone else to do it. Small scale for now. - No. - Five to eight people, new hires. I think I've gone through this. Yeah, I just have a revision on the second to the last paragraph. See if you're okay with that, because if it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me. Hi, hon, you're done with the meeting? Congrats! That's great. By the way, Finally! So we can launch the service next month? Yes, we're just waiting for the PCR, but next month is doable. Have I said this to you? What? Okay, anyway, I have some stuff to finish. Hey, are we good? As long as you're happy, I'm happy. So I can meet him too. Yeah. Just go ahead. Don't worry about me, I'll be fine. Yeah. Have a safe drive, okay? Hi! Let me just check... It's a dream come true for me to show a film here. Because this is where everything began for me. I'd like to thank everyone for coming. I just want to share with all of you my inspiration in making this film. Back in college, I had a partner in making films. She was the one who really encouraged me to create. But I didn't value her. Because at the time, I was also trying to find myself. I hurt her. I hope she can watch this film. And I hope I can also watch her film in the future. Because the truth is, between the two of us, she's the better filmmaker. I hope you like the movie. That's all. How was it? Are you two okay now? That film was great, right? Your script is even better, if you make it a film. You read it? Of course. I thought you didn't like it. You never gave your comments. I liked it so much that I submitted it to Cinemalaya. Are you serious? Who knows, right? Just make sure you hire me for the poster. Sure. And if I run out of budget, I'll get you as an actor for free. No problem. I want the role of Pancho. I want to be the lead. What? You're telling your director what to do? If I were you, I'd take acting workshops first. I was already feeling it, but you had to burst my bubble. What if COVID didn't happen? You think our date would've happened? Then you could've met Hiro. Maybe we'd be broken up by now. - You think? - Yeah. So am I still invited to the wedding? Yeah, of course you are. I'll come back on your wedding day. I'll be leaving this weekend. You're ready. That's great. Call me when you become a mom. I was thinking of picking you up. My phone's dead. The setting is post-apocalyptic. It's a love story, but not really. You've seen Mad Max, right? What script is this? You're going to direct? I don't know. Maybe. If the festival likes my script. Why? So you submitted? No, my friend submitted it. But I think it's an... Fi, that's not part of the plan. I just think it's a good opportunity, if they like it. - We can delay the plans, right? - What? Fi, we already have a plan. We have our wedding and the business expansion. I got carried away. And... Nothing's sure yet... so let's not fight about it. That's not it. Carlo... What if I tell you that I'd rather make mistakes now All right, Fi... let's make a plan. When's your shoot? When are you shooting? I don't know. You know what? Go ahead and make your film. We can start a family. That's a very fair offer. Is there still space? Can I hitch? Where are you going? To Quezon City, at my aunt's place. You? To Pasay City, my aunt's too. Thank you.
