- He wants to get married. - It is understood by the music. He regrets having to pay the wedding expenses. See how generous Poseidon was to us from Ithaca. - Lots of generosity. It is not normal. - If the fishing was good, you complain... and if it is plentiful, worry. I wanted to know why you threw so many fish into our nets. They jumped into our nets like they were crazy... - Do you think... - Nothing. Ithaca is nearby. You better hurry. Give you a hand too. Look! To the oars, quick! - Row! - Is arrested. Use the axe! Turn left! Quick, row! All together! Row hard! Remem! Remem! The monster hit us. Relief! Admit it! - What are you doing? - That's my son. It's my son. We have to get out fast or we'll meet the same fate. Won't you want to avenge your son? To the oars! My father bought it in town and he stole it. With a handful of salt and went home. King Laertes, this goat has always been mine. My mother and father gave me as a dowry. You liar, I'll break your head! Mine, try! You will see. I'm just waiting for the King's justice. Wait? Start soon. You're threatening me... He said he received it from his mother as a dowry. The goat is not an elephant, it does not live 200 years. - Take care of it. - Yes, Laertes. I'll take care of it right away. Will leave? And who will keep the goat? Let's start from the beginning, one at a time. - You didn't get it right, Ulysses. - Of course yes. Penelope can tell. - No, not enough. - Do you want me to take the disc as evidence? Would you like to do a half day hike? Hercules! We have to speak with King Laertes. Come with me. You wanted justice, you got it. It's your fault. My?! Who had the idea to come to King Laertes? King Laertes, the monster has appeared again. And once again the blood of one of us has stained the sea of ​​Ithaca. Admetos, son of Isminis and Feri. And this is Odyssea, whom he would marry. If we don't get rid of this curse as soon as possible... everything will be mourning and misery for us fishermen. Give us a suitable boat. And you, Hercules, do not deny your help. Quick, before the monster returns again. We have to kill him. When will the boat be ready? Immediately, if you are ready to leave. I will go with you. - You can't go without me. - Right. Hey I will. Thank you, King Laertes. Be careful! Listen to me, if I put three from Thebes against three from Ithaca... - how many soldiers do you have in total? - Four. What did you say, there are more than four. My father always says that to be one from Thebes, you need three from Ithaca. So, three from Ithaca against one from Thebes... However one, and three plus one is four. Ask him! Dad, Dad... - How much is five minus two? - You too...! Hi Anticlea. Hello Asclepios. I'm leaving now. It's nothing serious. We will board immediately. We're going to catch a big fat fish. - Let's have fun. - I will go with you. There is no danger. We'll be back tomorrow night. - Give me one more reason. - Do you want to leave him alone? Anticlea is here. I know what you think. There's nothing to worry about. Maybe I haven't told you the whole truth, but... I know the gods protect me. The gods, you can't go on believing. Too many to be true. Fast! Let's load! Ulysses! I can? You're kidding, I'm stronger than you. Carrier pigeons! What will they be used for? Take them! We'll be back before dark. Have you seen the supplies Hercules is carrying? Hercules always exaggerates. Your prudence resembles your strength. Ulysses, listen to your father. Never know. - Try to be wiser than Hercules. - He is well. And you, Penelope, don't you have any recommendations? My fate will be the same as theirs. We're not married yet. Drop the strings! drop anchor! Mom. I obey my king. Tonight we will be back. To the oars! Row! The wind is rising and the sea is getting worse. You sail the boat. - You better go back. - We will. In front of us. Starboard! - It is huge. See? - Look. To my right. Lower candle. - Paddle right! - To the oars, boys! Power on the oars! Ulysses. Ulysses. What are you waiting for? Come down! If our arms hold... we might be in Ithaca before the storm hits. Come with me! Give me the harpoon! - Come closer! - Row! - They can't take it anymore. - It doesn't matter, we have to try. But it's too far. All bow! Everyone pull the rope. Let's lose the prey. - Cut with the axe. - No, Hercules, no. It will escape. Do what I tell you. To the oars! Faster, boys! Turn right! - Power the oars. - We can't stay here. Row! Are you below us? - Reply! I'm going to go crazy... - Calm down. Hercules hit him. There is nothing to fear. It won't live long. - The monster hit us. - Take command, Hercules. Ulysses, come with me. All at the oars. Row with all your might! - The keel broke. - He wants to sink us before he dies. - And got the damn thing. - And now? Soon we will sink. Maybe they were already out. That the storm here in Ithaca doesn't mean that... You yourself could distinguish the candles when the first clouds appeared... Who are you trying to deceive? Ask the sea... And they ask us... as if we know something... and our feelings were not the same as they experienced. Look! - A dove! - It's definitely from Ulysses. Come son. Come with me! What a messenger! Very brave! The monster proved to be very stubborn, it was a lot of work, but we were more stubborn than him and in a few days we will be taking its skeleton at the borders of Ithaca. Let's take the news to the fishermen's families. "Dentro de uns dias"! So that's not what Hercules said. And neither does Ulysses. Always taking it as a joke. I know, but I love him. Just as you love Hercules. - Stop! - Just one sip. - No. - It's not for me, it's for them. The next ration will be at dusk. For all! He denies us some water but he can feed the doves. Why is the king's son? He feeds the doves with my feed. It does not matter. Then we ate, so we would satisfy our hunger. So if we eat them, who will tell my father where we sink? They won't know anything about us. They'll think we're dead. And your families? You talk too much... - No one will touch the doves. - No, no. - I'll share the water. - Yes Yes. - When and as much as I want. - Yes Yes... Excellent. You can go up again. A seagull! There! Earth! Praise be to Zeus! cheer up! We are here too. Don't be selfish, throw us something. Give it to us too. We will. C'mon C'mon. Play for us. - Don't eat it all alone. - They're sailors. Get up here! You already have enough. Think of us. Take it! - Drop it! - It's mine. No! It's mine. There goes another! Relief! Relief! run away! - You must be crazy. - Relief! I don't know what animal this is, but it's delicious. If we knew what an animal this is, we would know where we are. - Or we could deduce. - Sounds like a cozy place to me. I looked around as I ate my meal. And then? Looked down there. And I saw that there is a path that leads to the interior. - Then we could go there! - Yes let's go! Hey, one moment! Our messengers. Before we had the shadow in front, now it's on the side. We've been walking for about four hours now. - We'll be out of the forest soon. - We hope so. They're afraid of us. Maybe it's our appearance, or for some other reason. If we are where I think we are, we have come a long way. Hercules, where do you think we are? - And Judea. - And Judea? Yes. Their houses, clothes, people... your fear... I don't think I was wrong. - Maybe he's a priest. - I do not know. - Adonai be with you. - Adonai? We are from Greece. A storm brought us here. What country is this? Is there a possibility that we can find a boat? A boat? No. The sea is too far away. You must know well, since it came from him. If it's true as I said... that they're Greeks. Who are they? What they want? And besides, we are very poor. Seren is the only one who can help them. Boom? King of the Philistines. They must go to Gaza. Gaza?! What are you saying? Are we in Judea? - Yeah, what's weird? - It seems impossible... - We are from the tribe of Dan. - Is Gaza far away? - They would never arrive on foot. - Then give us horses. We will pay with these stones. They are gemstones. Do you think that's enough? Of course, but here there are no horses. They are beautiful. - We'll help as we can. - Look how many good things. They are very generous. - This is for you. - What a pretty girl! - What is your name? - Leah. And my daughter. Looks like my son, only a little bigger. They want to go to Gaza. Stay tuned. They could be Philistine spies looking for you, Samson. Maybe they tell the truth, but it's good to be careful. No one will escape the slaughter of the Philistine king, if you know that I hide with you. Send them to Azer and then I'll leave. The king's soldiers are looking for me, they will be here soon. Go to them! Quickly! - I hear you're looking for horses? - Yea. Behind that hill you will find Azer, a Philistine merchant. - Which will serve you well. - Whats the way? Back at the exit, turning left, you will see a lighthouse on the edge. Move on. And I conclude by saying that we will be back soon. - Right! - Sure! Look! - What did you do, Azer? - They're pretty, aren't they? All our horses for four stones. Don't tell me this was a good deal. They are worth 100 gold coins and the horses were borrowed. - It is true? Will you bring it back? - Not them, I will. I already said! It's Greeks going to Gaza to find a boat. We will accompany them and we will return with the horses. - We? - Yes. Daros is coming with me. - But will you leave me alone? - For a few days. - For how many? - I do not know. Stop this! Nobody will steal from me. If you were kidnapped, it would be my luck. Azer! Follow me! This way! The first message was clear. Naufragaram. Will they get a boat to bring them back? I do not believe. Who knows! It also seems unlikely to me . As far as I know, there is no... Only a boat like that of Argos could make such a long and dangerous journey. You're right. We will call Argos. Let's consult them. We promised a reward of 100 gold coins... to anyone who helps our soldiers capture the Danite Samson... we are looking for the rebel and agitator. You can see Seren's seal... our generous lord, king of the Philistines and ruler of Judea. No, wait! Nobody move! It's an order! As you can see, the king doesn't just promise words. Quiet! Hear me all! Samson killed a lion near your village. With the strength of her arms, strangling him. And he was seen coming this way. Now the soldiers will search every house. They will search everything, and if they find... a single sign that was here. We will pass the village by fire and iron. What do you answer? - Begin! - Disassemble! - Did you find anything? - No. Look better. - What's in here? - These skins. - Look! - I'm a leather tanner. No sign of injury. Do you still deny that it belongs to the lion strangled by Samson? - In the name of God, I assure you... - What God? Yours perhaps? Samson was here. We found the evidence. What did I tell you? I'm going back to the palace. The smell of burning flesh makes me nauseous. Do not forget. Destroy the plants to the roots. May none of your children become another Samson. Levem-nos! Exterminate them all... least young people to become slaves. Leave the village in ashes! We'll be there soon. The Gaza oasis is at the end of the valley. - So we're here? - No. It has the same name... for the city there is still a long way to go. If so, we'll stop for a while to rest. As you wish. Still! Calm! What was there? We will. Calm! run away! Come on, Ulysses! Needless to say. Let's go! Angry. Bravo, Hercules! Very good! Samson? - Who else could it be? - Like yesterday, don't you remember? Yesterday I didn't see your face, it was far away. There are not two men in all Judea... able to face and kill a lion without weapons... only with your hands. - But he said he's Greek. - Of course, and who knew? who is a Danite and is called Samson? The shipwreck and everything else are made up stories... to approach our king unharmed to kill him. - But you won't. - What are you going to do? I'm going to Gaza, and you 're going to lead him into a trap. - The reward will be mine. - It will be ours. - Azer, Daros... - Answer! Yes, I'll go right away. - I don't see Azer, where is he? - He got scared and went home. He's got problems with his wife... Don't worry, I also know the way. This way. We will. - Come on, Odysseus! - I am going! Down on the precipice, the oasis! Someone is ahead of us. Some strange travelers. camped. - Foreign? - They're not Philistines. - How many are there? - Six or seven. Let's go. I certainly don't think they 're Danite rebels. Samson is too smart to expose himself like that. And he wouldn't come without an escort. In any case, let's interrogate them. - Hercules! - What's it? Up there. There were three men, but they disappeared. I can't say for sure, but they looked like soldiers. What interests you? Quickly! Daros! - Yes, sir. - Show us the way. This way. - Are they foreigners? - Yes. Greeks from Ithaca. We had a shipwreck and we are going to Gaza to find a boat to take us home. And your horses? Not ours. Explain to him, Daros. Rented from Azer, my master. - Oh, yes, Azer. Where is he? -He came home. I'll be back with the horses when they board. Their clothes don't prove they're Greeks. For what we took, it proves our shipwreck. No? Yes, it's evident. They will find what to wear when they arrive in Gaza. Bon Voyage! Azer to speak with you. - Is what you say true? - Yea! Enough! Get out! Who do you think I dance for? For myself? If Azer tells the truth... will not dance again. For no one else. True? Why? Samson... comes here with a group of Danites. Better. This will end your hunt. Delilah, don't you understand? He comes to hunt me. It openly challenges me. He's willing to do anything. Right. So defend yourself! Counterattack, fight! You think it's easy to fight someone who claims to be sent by a hostile and terrible God? And why should I defend myself? This land belongs to me by right of conquest. And the Jews are my subjects. And they all owe me obedience. And taxes and slaves. That's why they hated you. My Lord. Samson swore to kill me. And say so? Maybe lost its value... by attacking the hapless Danite village? Nobody knows who Samson is. We only know his exploits. Famous. We've never seen him before. We don't know anything about him. We just know it exists. But there is also Delilah. And I know how to receive it and how to tame it. High! High! stop! Better! stop! A woman fell! Better! Better! We hope! pity. - Stand up! - You don't need the whip. Better let her go. Now give advice! Said to let her go. Go ahead! We are free! Bring him here! The others prepare the chains! Go back! Everyone behind him, we'll take care of the prisoners later... they won't be able to go very far. - Where do they come from? - From the village of Danita. They killed the children, the old and the sick. All the people who could not be sold into slavery. They burned the houses. What happened to the old man with the furs? Died! Greeks? Do you think they lied, that they didn't shipwreck like they said? They were spies for the Philistines. Serpents sent from Gaza... who used a false friendship. I hope I live, until I meet this man again! How many is it missing? Before the sun sets, we will arrive in the city. We not only defend ourselves, we counterattack bravely. Everyone fought furiously. I managed to save myself because I pretended I was dead. How many were there? - There was only him, Samson! -Was he alone? It's impossible. Fear blinded him. It was terrible. It launched with a mighty force... the spears penetrated relentlessly. They seemed to be thrown by a hundred hands. But it was Samson alone, there was no one else. I do not believe in you. I will never believe. Samson... So what is he like? Robust, tall as a young oak. I had never seen a man like this before. It looked like the image of an avenging god. Would you recognize him if you saw him again? Recognize it? It would be more forgetful... my father's face. Are they. Go, Azer! We will accompany you. We look forward to it. Every country has its customs, but in hospitality we are much more... They were informed of our arrival. And in this case? Welcome to this realm. May I ask you the reason for your visit? From the way we were greeted, I assumed he already knew us. We are Greeks, we came from Ithaca, not of our own volition... - and we want to come back if you... - Ithaca? It's too far. A lot, yes. But storms do not measure distances. - What does it means? - This is a precaution. There is one among you who does not need weapons to kill a lion. And therefore, it can be dangerous to threaten the life of your king. I don't need weapons to kill a lion. - It saw? - And you are not my king. Yes I know. who is saying this, and is convincing the people to disown and hate me. - Everything you said is not true! - Yes it's true. I know that all Judea is in your arms... that can crush bones of beasts... and exterminate alone, alone. He understands? Dozens and dozens of my soldiers. By the arms of Samson the Danite. Samson? I do not know who it is. It's the first time I've heard this name. I repeat that my companions and I are Greeks... And our king is Laertes. - It's him? - Yea. Azer! He himself, I saw it with my eyes. He killed the lion. He! - Without using weapons? - Yes, no weapons. I do not deny and confirm. It wasn't the first. I've killed others in Greece. But what does that mean...? calm down! Hang on! Is it Samson? Look, do you recognize it? This man... Is dead! To the door! Get ready! Aim for them. But now it will be different... the Danites wanted to get out of here alive... only if I want to! Let this man prove his point. Who can really prove it to be Samson? Azer too, only thinks about the reward. If this man tells the truth... he is the only one who can stand up to Samson. You, hear me. I want to believe you. I'll give you three days to prove your point. Bring me Samson here as a prisoner and I will give you the freedom, the boat, everything you want. But if the deadline runs out and I'm not back... or come back alone... your companions will be executed... and you will also die... then, or on the first occasion. Oil. - There is no other way out. - We're sure you'll make it. And where can I find this danite? Go to the square and wait. Someone will come to show you the way. They are looking for a carriage with white horses. Follow me! - Did you get your reward? - Looks like it's not him. - What? - It's not him. In three days we will know. If it's Greek, if it's Danite, or whatever. It's a big mess. Leave me alone! - I didn't expect to see you. - Why do I bother you, Hercules? No. How do you know my name? Don't you remember that you left your companions at the palace? Hercules. No. You didn't lie. Why didn't the king come with the guards? Why a woman? Because there was already a man... suitable. Hercules! Don't you want to come take a shower with me? When I find something like that, I like to pluck the feathers myself. - Is it a Greek refinement? - Prudence, Greek. Come on, come on. cheer. Suppose I don't arrest the king of the Philistines... think for a moment. It would mean not returning to Greece. And I want to go back to Greece. As soon as I saw you, I knew you weren't Samson. You already told me that. Yes, but before I told you, I told Seren. Why do you think I did this? - Why? - I do not know. Because... because I wanted to save you. Intoxicating! I do not envy a man who falls in love with such beauty. I do not envy as I should. Let's go! Delilah! Delilah! - Delilah! - Yea? Why are you dressed like this? Where is the wagon and the women? On the way to Gaza. - We are alone, Hercules. - But... Let's hunt. You know, this is how we dress to hunt. I'm ready. Now it is your turn. We will? We're in your area. Stay tuned! If you hear a noise, bend over immediately. Your weapons attack unexpectedly. And they never miss the mark. The so-called champion of Judea, Do n't you have the courage to fight with equal weapons? It will be the first time. No one else fought me alone. Is that you! You are the spy! So it's like that?! I have nothing against you, Samson. I don't know why you fight the Philistines... but I must deliver it to your king. For 100 gold coins? I will drag you to Gaza before the king kills my companions. - What companions? - Who are the king's hostages. Greeks like me. - Who are you? - They confused me with you. I'm not one of them. He had never encountered an opponent with his strength. I was thinking the same. Hear me, my friends are in the king's hands... and there is a bounty on your head. Instead of fighting for no reason, the two of us we freed my comrades... and you will once again mock the Philistine king who wants you dead. This woman, Delilah, is not Danite. It was her idea to disguise herself and also... Was listening. - Too late. - Maybe not. I didn't understand why I was running. He hands me over to the king and you get 100 gold coins. - Samson! - Samson. Samson is here. Samson came back to us. - Are you leaving? - Yes. We don't want to stay here. - We abandoned our destroyed homes. - Where are you going? Where to take us. Like always. His will is our law. Before nightfall, we have to finish... to bury our dead. On the hill? Yes. You understand now why we call them oppressors... and why do we fight it? - Lord be with you. - And with you, Samson. Come down! No! Can't do this. It's hurting me. Tom! I leave it to your care. If she escapes, we will be slaughtered. I am a Philistine, I must obey. I couldn't imagine such cruelty by the king's guards. If I had known, I would have rebelled, believe me, Samson. Believe me! Even if you paid with your life. - Take her! - No. No, Samson, no. I beg you. Samson, don't leave me in their hands. If I have to be a prisoner, I'd rather be yours. Samson. Samson, have mercy. Help me! No, no. Samson. Samson. Whoever gave him strength also gave him pity... You are noble, Samson. Generous. Help me! Help me! Leave her! Set me free, Samson. - Listen, Delilah... - I don't know what your plans are... but I know they will fail. I know the king, he is stronger than you, much more. It will kill you and your companions. Does our life and theirs matter so much to you ? Yes Yes. I will tell you what to do. You will go to the temple of Dagora, on the coast... where a boat awaits you, Samson must appear in chains. Then your Greek companions will arrive , escorted by the guards. Chained only apparently. And then? As soon as the Philistine ship sets sail, the guards will come to capture you. You can run away with the horse that Hercules will leave for you. Why don't you believe me? I want to help them. There is no other way, it is the only way to deceive the king... without arousing suspicion. But. You need to set me free... I have to go back... so you can try to save them. - She's as smart as she is beautiful. - And equally sincere? Also thinks I lie. So kill me mercilessly right now. Dying by your hands, I don't care. But don't humiliate me by handing me over to your people. Did you forget that you are my brothers in faith? They despise me, and I can't stand their contempt. You are different from them, maybe you hate me... but hate is something else. And death too. - Are you feeling calmer? - Only when you're in Ithaca... with Hercules, I will feel calmer. Ithaca is far away, but her husband is near. Tomorrow we will be in Gaza. If Argos said... What did you say? Hercules is Greek and the only man in all of Palestine... able to capture Samson. But do you know why this was possible? Why intervened between the two. Well... He arranged for the exchange of Greek prisoners... in the temple of Dagora. Wait! Delilah kept her word. A boat is just a boat. Is a woman... is always a woman. It is not? See there! They go! - No more, no less. As I had said. - At least for now. - We will! - Just a moment. Now it's with us. Stay alert! We will be discovered. - Watch out for the soldiers in the basement. - Tell them. - There are soldiers in the basement. - There are soldiers in the basement. If Delilah didn't deceive us, you don't have to approach... before the boat has left. Look! - Good luck, Samson! - Good luck, Hercules! Hercules... Hercules, the Philistines are in hiding. Come! Follow me! I think I found it! Come! Here! - Where did they go? - Calm down. We will see them again. There's no way to escape. But why did they stop? Soldiers should be encouraged... motivate them... and above all... help them! Let's move on! Let's move on! What did you say? Tonight we will celebrate the end of Samson... and your Greek friend. Curse! There they are! Come with us! Atires! Atires! Atires! All at once! The boat of Argos! Come back! Hercules! Samson! My foot caught on a rock. Raise oars! It was written that salvation would have the name of a woman. lole ... Doom could also be named after a woman. Cuide de Dalila. Farewell, Greeks! May you have a good trip! - Goodbye, Samson. - Goodbye, Samson. The wind started. set sail. Translation: KUNCKA END
