Look, Cindy, I'm sorry. I don't know what happened. I know what happened. Look, Cindy, I'm sorry I forgot to pick you up from the airport. Well, if you hadn't have forgotten, how would I know for sure that you're my brother? I'm sorry. CINDY: Remember that Jamaican restaurant we went to with that fish? JOHN: Oh, yeah. Coley's, I think it was. Man, that was so good. No, no, I had enough to drink at the wedding. -How was that? -CINDY: You know me. -Always a bridesmaid. -That's not gonna change. You're already married to this darn notebook. -You startin' to look alike. -Give me that. You know my life's in this book. That's the problem. -You OK? -I'm fine. I'm fine. Are you taking your medicine? Let me see that. Come on. Mints? Really, John? Look, look, my prescription ran out, and I don't like takin' those things anyway. They make my head all swimmy. Besides, you're always complainin' about the shit that comes outta my mouth, at least now it's minty fresh. Nice necklace. Who got you that? Some jerk brother. So tell me, how are the, uh, slums of Brazil treating you? CINDY: They're fine. I'm flying back tomorrow. And favelas aren't slums, John. There's a lot of culture there. Oh, cultural slums. That makes it better, but they're still dangerous. I regret getting you involved in this in the first place. I'm fine. -You sure about that? -Yes. I'm just tired, you know. Jet lag. Take care of yourself, Johnny. (DOOR CLOSES) (BRAZILIAN DANCE MUSIC) -Al6. Como vai? -Bom dia. Katarina. We'll never win them over wearing that. I won't win them over, but I won't keel over.

Detective Thiago Santo, Rio de Janeiro police, and this is my partner, Carlo Bororo. -Please, have a seat. -Oh, thank you. So, Detective Thiago, to what do I owe the pleasure? Bad news, I'm afraid. One of yours. Apparently, she was doing social work for an American non-profit in the favelas. You know her. Is she...? Alive. Barely. She was found in the favela. Who the hell would do this? When you work with animals, you're bound to get bit. (PHONE RINGS) Hello? What? When? What hospital? I'm on my way. (DISQUIETING MUSIC) (ENERGETIC PERCUSSION MUSIC) Kuka. You heard about Cindy, yeah? You don't know anything about that, do you? That's what I thought. You think they all lie. If the shoe fits on the other foot. (GUNFIRE, SIRENS WAIL) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) (SIREN APPROACHES) (TYRES SCREECH TO A HALT, SIREN STOPS) Hey! They did nothing! (CHUCKLES) Opa! The same favela where an American social worker, Cindy Chapman, was almost killed a few days ago? Do you have any witnesses? Any suspects? Any leads at all? (LAUGHS) Opa! Soda! (LAUGHS) Mm. No, you're right. It's not gonna work. The soda is too warm! We need ice. The department gave your gentle approach a chance. One half-dead American later, it's time to do it my way. So you made a lot of progress. Let's avoid a nasty scene here. I'll make you a deal. Your best fighter against mine. If we win, we live to fight another day. But if we win? (LAUGHS AND SIGHS) We give you back all your stuff, we let everyone go... ...and we never come back. A deal. Opa! Opa! Ooh. (MAN GROANS) So... ...we'll come back as often as necessary until we get whoever attacked the American! And you. Don't forget whose side you're on. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACH) Thiago! (GROANS) I brought the ice! (LAUGHS) (AEROPLANE ENGINE DRONES) (INDISTINCT PA. ANNOUNCEMENT) MAN: Taxi. Manny. John. Nice suit. I see you stopped working out. Good seeing you, pal, under the circumstances. Wanna get something to eat? You hungry? -No, I wanna go see my sister. -That's what I figured. Come on. (MACHINE BEEPS) We've put her into an induced coma, giving her brain a chance to recover. (GUNFIRE AND SHOUTING) MANNY: John? John, you OK? Will she make it? DOCTOR: I wish I could tell you. Given the extent of her wounds, it's a miracle she made it this far. Hey, come on in. John, this is Detective Thiago. He's in charge of investigating Cindy's case. I'm so sorry about your sister, Mr Chapman. (SIGHS) The crime in the favela is very terrible, especially recently. My men and I will do everything in our power to find whoever did this. She was volunteering. Why would someone attack her? The favelados see an American, they see money. So it was robbery? Well, she was found without the wallet, no cash, no jewellery. So do you have any leads? We're questioning several known criminals from the neighbourhood. -We'll have something. -OK, it's been a long day. Let's get you back to the hotel for some rest. No, no no. I wanna go where Cindy was found. With all due respect, Mr Chapman, the favela isn't exactly a tourist destination. Well, I'm not your regular tourist. Good, good, good. Let's, uh...let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Thank you, Detective. We'll see you downstairs. It's a terrible thing, all this violence in the favela. Just a couple of drug dealers battling each other to... ...to sell more drugs to more addicts in more areas. If they think you're on the wrong side, bang. Right or wrong. Your sister is in God's hands now. I will pray for her. In my experience, all God's good for is giving people a reason to kill each other. Better than killing each other without a reason, no? That's for savages. (BEEPS HORN) Next generation, don't be fooled. THIAGO: Officer Da Silva, this is John Chapman, the victim's brother. He would like to see the crime scene. Officer Da Silva is in charge of the security of the favela. -(CAR ENGINE STARTS) -(BANG!) -THIAGO: Whoa! -(BANG!) Mr Chapman, my side-arm, please. Are you alright? Jet lag. I should be heading back. (SIGHS) Follow me, Mr Chapman. Please. There. One of the local children found her just in time. Not the most secluded place, is it? Any witnesses? So far, no. Yeah, right. Nobody saw anything? The favela is a complicated place, Mr Chapman. Nothing complicated about a slum controlled by drug dealers. KATARINA: Come with me. (CHILDREN CHATTER) Look there. You see that clinic? It treats 250 people a day. Who do you think pays for that? I don't know, the government? The government forgot about this place a long time ago. Day care, doctors, teachers. Drug money pays for all of it. The drug dealers take care of the people here, and in exchange, the people protect the drug dealers. Aren't drug dealers just wonderful? The world is rarely white and black, Mr Chapman, especially here in the favela. (MACHINE BEEPS) -Everything OK? -Oh, yes. Time for her medication. (SIGHS) (MACHINE BEEPS FASTER) JOHN: Nurse! Nurse. Come back... Something's wrong. It's my sister, she's convulsing. How long has she been like this? Since right after the nurse put meds in her IV. You saw someone inject her IV? Yeah, it was a nurse. She was Asian. -Who disconnected this? -No, I-| didn't do that. It was like that when I came here. (MACHINE BEEPS) -Get the IV going. -NURSE: Lorazepam going. -B.P. dropping. -DOCTOR: Get the paddles, stat! -NURSE: We're losing her! -(SIREN WAILS) -MANNY: You sure? -DOCTOR: I'm sure. There are no Asian nurses on our staff. MANNY: I'll talk to him. So what'd they find out? Who was she? Johnny, they said there's no Asian nurses on the staff. You sure you saw her? We'll get to the bottom of this. No, that's not good enough. We need a guard here to make sure she's safe. I'll have someone here as of tomorrow. -Goodnight, gentlemen. -Goodnight. -Alright. Catch you tomorrow. -Yeah. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (MEN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY) Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me. Excuse me, do you speak English? Excuse me. Do you know this woman? Have you... Where'd you get that necklace? Necklace. Where did you get the necklace? (GROANS) (KUKA GROANS) Where did you get the necklace? Where...did you get... the necklace? Stop! Let him go! He's wearing Cindy's necklace. Now! What the hell are you doing? He's got on Cindy's necklace. This is Kuka. Cindy used to work with his sister and she was killed a few days ago. Cindy gave him the necklace as a gift. KUKA: Maria. My sister. I'm sorry. My condolences. (SPEAKS PORTUGUESE) He says he wants to show you something that he has. Let's go. I'm sorry. (SPEAKS PORTUGUESE) The pages were already torn out when he found it. This is definitely Cindy's. Practically her whole life was in this thing. -Oh. -No, no, no. You keep it. She wanted you to have it. It's the least I can do. Thank you. So, what happened to Kuka's sister? We don't know. Her body hasn't been found. There have been a string of similar occurrences all over town. All favela kids. Child prostitutes, mostly. So, if you haven't found the bodies, how do you know they're dead? Around here, when prostitutes disappear, there's only two places they end up - the ocean or the dump. What? (WOMEN CHATTER INDISTINCTLY) Opa. Tarado. (HORN BEEPS) Opa, opa, opa. (ENGINE REVS) -How much? -35. -Anal? -50. Venha aqui. Filho de puta. So, you like little girls, eh? (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) Obrigado. Cindy's last appointment. (KEYPAD PIPS) (OTHER PHONE RINGS) MAN: Hola. Bruno. Hello, Bruno. Hi. This is John Chapman. I believe you know my sister, Cindy Chapman? BRUNO: Uh, OK? Hey, uh, listen, I-I need to... ...meet with you as soon as possible. Hello? You there? BRUNO: Oh, OK. OK, um... Not at night. My photo studio's on Via Colina. Meet me in the cafe outside, tomorrow at, uh, 7am. There'll be plenty of people there. OK, got it. See you there. Thank you. (TENSE MUSIC) BRUNO: Oh, man. I've been so freaked out since I've heard about Cindy. She's a great girl. I'm sorry. -How do you know Cindy? -I'm a photographer. She convinced me to take photos of the favela, you know, poor kids, but they can use them to raise money. Is that why Cindy got hurt? No. Have you heard about the.. kid whores disappearing? You mean the children from the favela? Yes. Yeah, yeah. Everyone thinks they're dead. But your sister was convinced that there's something going on. More than meets the eye. So she started doing her own investigation. Used her contacts in the favela, you know, the charities, even the policia. Last week, Cindy called... Cindy calls me excited, gives me a place and a time. She had arranged a meeting with someone that could blow this whole thing wide open. Your sister had me hide and take the pictures of the meeting. So, what did she find out? She didn't tell me. And I didn't come to find out. I just take photos, you know? -Did you go to the police? -(LAUGHS) Listen to me, man. I really like your sister, she is a good soul, but whosever toes she stepped on doesn't have a problem putting people in the ground. So, I talk to you, but now I'm done. OK? So, where are the photos? I-I gave them to Cindy, the originals. -Can I have the copies? -No. They're my insurance. OK, well, thanks for your time. No problema. JOHN: Hey, listen, man, I appreciate the fact that Cindy had friends like you in her corner. You understand? Means a lot to me. OK. Thank you. (ENGINE STARTS) (PEOPLE SCREAM AND YELL) (EXPLOSIONS AND GUNFIRE) (BREATHES RAPIDLY) (TYRES SQUEAL) (GUNFIRE) Ohh! (BRAKES SQUEAL) MAN: Go, go, go, go! (GRUNTS) Ugh! Ooh! (TYRES SQUEAL) MANNY: Well, that must be the guy she was meeting. JOHN: Yeah, looks like a model citizen. I'll print 'em out for you, but it doesn't give you much. Tats - the guys who shot at me had these elaborate tattoos, full sleeves, you know, like the Asian gangster movies. Yakuza? -Yeah, but here? -Well, don't write 'em off. Brazil has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan and Yakuza, they lie low, but they've been here since the '70s and they have no problem partnering up with local gangs that will service their needs. Hey, stop. Back up. Right there. Now zoom in. Right there. Stop. Go to the right. What's that say? 'Ronos'? 'Kronos'. Oh, that's a local nightclub. I know where that is. Wait a second. I'll take you there. No, no, no. I cannot get you mixed up in all this. You've pulled my ass out of the fire more than once. Least I can do is be your chauffeur. Besides, with someone watching you shit will stop blowing up in this city. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) (PEOPLE CHATTER AND LAUGH) VIP only. Tres, quatro, cinco... (DOOR OPENS) (HUFFS) I can... What the hell you looking at? Oh! Ugh! (WHIMPERS) Do you know her? No. I know you know her and I know you met her. Make it easier on yourself and tell me why. I don't remember. Oh, you don't remember, huh? -You know what? -Oh! You didn't wash your hands. That's nasty. Let me teach you some hygiene. No! (GURGLES) -(GASPS) -Remember her now? She was just some puta I met. Oh, man, that's my sister. (MOANS) -(GASPS AND COUGHS) -Can you do better? (CURSES IN PORTUGUESE) -OK. -(GROANS) (MOANS) (GASPS) -OK. -No! Wait! I'll tell you! I'll tell you. Some big-mouthed favelado told her about my services. What services? -Import/export. -Smuggling. She started following me. She saw me make an arrangement with one of my clients and confronted me about it. She shouldn't have done that. No! Wait! I didn't do anything to her! I didn't touch her. I didn't have to. My client had people there watching. They saw everything - her, the guy in the car, everything. Who's your client? Hey, man, the pool's still open. OK, OK, OK. Head out of town going north-west. There's a small dirt road 25 kilometres after Volta Redonda that leads to La Hacienda. My client owns the place. OK, but if I find out you're lying to me I'm gonna come back and finish your swimming lesson. Oh! (COUGHS) (MAN MUTTERS IN PORTUGUESE) THIAGO: OK, ladies! Today we take back the favela. An American social worker went there trying to do good things and thanks to the animals she's in the hospital fighting for her life. It's a shame that's what it took to get our bosses' attention. But no matter. Your targets are the pillars of the drug trade, the sex trade, the murder. Take them down and this whole mess falls apart. We're doing God's work. So no shame, no guilt, no pity. Just put them in the ground! So let's go! Go, go, go, go, go! MANNY: Give me all the intel you have on this Hacienda place. We're on our way there now. Just tell 'em to make it fast. What do you got? Looks like just shipping manifests. Let me see. Ah, my favourite smuggler DJ, Mr Lima. Oh, shit. These are fake. It's already got the customs stamp, but check out the departure date. Shit. THIAGO: (DRAMATIC MUSIC) THIAGO: Wow. Check this place out. MANNY: Oh, I'm sure it's all totally legit. What's the plan? I go in. You go back home. Besides, you need to be at work soon anyway. Sure you don't want me to come in and save your ass as usual? (DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES) (EASYGOING MUSIC PLAYS) (PEOPLE CHATTER AND LAUGH) Welcome. What's your pleasure? I don't know.

I'll show you. Follow me. JOHN: She was here. There were children, there were people... Look. Counterfeit shipping manifests. They're trying to smuggle the children out. Mr Chapman, why don't you give me Mr Lima's briefcase? We'll handle it from here. (BRIEFCASE THUDS, LOCKS CLICK) Thank you. Da Silva, take Mr Chapman to the hotel. We'll go check out the docks.

(GROANS) In my locker at the station there is a... ...a list of people, everyone Hirimoto's got on the take - the police, the courts, the government. Give it to Katarina. She will make it right. (GROANS) I was the first in my family to reach 45. Most of my family still live in the favela. And I was going to get us out. But... ...such is the will of God. God has nothing to do with this. You made your own choices. I didn't attack your sister, I swear. I may be a sinner, but not a savage. Hyah! Oh! My judgement is near. Do you still have one round in that gun? (GUNSHOT) (SIRENS BLARE IN DISTANCE) (GENTLE SOMBRE MUSIC) -Hey. -(DOOR OPENS) She's just exhausted. Even the tiniest effort is monumental for her right now. How long till she's back on her feet? Well, Mr Chapman, there's something you need to understand. The injuries your sister suffered were very extensive, including severe head trauma. It's going to be a long, slow process for her to get back to functioning by herself. We're talking about a matter of years. (DOOR CLOSES) Hi. Uh, coffee. Black, please. Whiskey - neat. Make it a double. It's 9:00 in the morning. Yeah, you're right. Excuse me. Make that a single. Nice. Look, John. You saved dozens of kids from hell. Manny, I... It's funny - I thought I'd feel better once I got these guys, but seeing Cindy like that today, man... Stop, stop. You... you can't think like that. You're gonna destroy yourself. So how about Uncle Manny gives you something else to destroy? See, me and some of the higher-ups at the State Department are always thinking, "Man, wouldn't it be nice to have someone "to get the job done when no-one else can?" -Isn't that what the CIA is for? -Come on. Their plate's full. Between China and the Middle East, trying to run anything through that bureaucracy? Forget about it. Thank you. What I'm thinking about is something a little less official. I don't know, man. My head's still messed up. But there is also one other thing you have to consider - Cindy's condition. Those medical bills are gonna pile up for years to come. -What are you getting at? -Come on, man. She doesn't have any insurance. I've been running those bills through the embassy. How long you think that's gonna last? However, if she were a dependent of a government agent, well, that's a whole different ball game. So you're saying if I take the job you'll make sure Cindy's taken care of? Mm-hm. -But what if I don't? -There's only so much I can do. When do I start? You already did. It's your old call sign.
