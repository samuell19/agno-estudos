'World famous Natasarvabhouma Mr. Nandamuri Tarakarama Rao..' '..established a political party by name Telugu Desam..' '..just in 9 months, like nobody has ever seen or heard of it,..' '..on January 9th, 1983..' '..he became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.' 'But in the next elections held in 1989..' '..he lost for many unexpected reasons.' 'Because of that failure, his friends,..' '..his family, his children, his party cadre..' '..and all those who were near to him left him.' 'At that time a lady entered into his lonely life.' 'Her name was Lakshmi Parvathi.' Who is it? - My name is Lakshmi Parvathi. I spoke to Mr. Rama Rao on phone and took an appointment. He is not feeling well. He is sleeping. It will take time. That's fine. I will wait till he is awake. Okay. (Thunder crashing) (Thunder crashing) (Call bell rings) (Anklets tinkling) Swamy, I am Lakshmi Parvathi, who spoke to you on phone. You gave me appointment. Tell me, Lakshmi Parvathi. Why did you want to meet me? Swamy since I know,.. ..I have a lot of affection towards you,.. ..your movies and your personality. I never slept a day without thinking of you. You influenced me so much. I have seen many students,.. ..who implemented what I told them about you.. ..and have dreams of reaching great heights.. That's why.. ..many things about your political career.. ..to convey it to the future generations.. ..it's my wish to write your life history as a book. That's why I came here to seek your permission. Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.. My life is as hills, abyss, ocean. With the point of view that every human sees.. ..its form changes. Yours is a very early age. To understand me.. ..your experience is not enough. My age might be smaller than yours, Swamy. If you are a mountain, I am just a small stone. But in my limits,.. ..with all strength I have,.. ..since my childhood.. ..even I have been trying to swim against the stream. What did you study? MPhil, gold medalist in Telugu literature. Oh. From there, you have this deep awareness. When I was making my mythical movies,.. ..I used to have wonderful discussions with scholars. Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, please come inside. The writer of your movie, Daana Veera Soora Karna,.. ..Mr. Kondaveeti Venkatakavi, I have a lot of respect for him, Swamy. Please come. Forgive me. I made you wait outside. Since I was feeling weak, I slept for a while. Swamy, please don't say like that. I can't hear the word, weak, from you. NTR means power. I always feel you as power of power. I didn't wish for the power. People gave me. I came to politics to serve them. They trusted me and gave me power. But, today, they didn't want me.. ..and took back my power. Now I don't have any desire on these.. ..powers and seats, Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi. Swamy, there might be a number of reasons.. ..for taking back what they gave you. But what you gave them.. ..can never be forgotten by them. That might be, rice for two rupees,.. ..or the construction houses for poor,.. ..or the ban of alcohol.. ..or can be some other thing. Some, what you thought.. ..what you implemented.. ..might not have happened as they thought. For that not happening like that.. ..your subordinates not implementing properly might also be a reason. Swamy.. ..how many kings have lost in wars? But with doubled courage, they tried again.. ..and won in the war. Victory and losing are just in our thoughts.. ..and you know this very well. "Victory or losing are just the thoughts that are in our mind." "They both are just a part of life." "The west sword stands against the Sun and defeats it." "East comes and gives victory in the mornings." "If eyes look forward, the victory will be yours." "Someone will come together and become light in darkness and umbrella in rain.." "Someone will come in front." "Someone will step forward." "Even if fire rises, won't the summer tiredness go away? "The rain drops fall slowly.." "The clouds in the sky go away when air blows." "Moonlight on the Earth makes everything sprout." "At the time of the crops sprouting.." "..won't the rain drops help it out?" "The day when fought together, someone will come as a pair." (Music) "Sea will flow with new energy." "When the full moon comes." "When yagnam ends and the fire is warm,.." "..it will fire again when the air becomes associate." "When the cuckoo sings.." "..will the autumn not be associate?" "The day stay together, someone will come as your support." So much of depth in meaning, awareness.. ..in this age, how did you get it, Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi? By studying you, Swamy. (Chuckles) That means.. ..is it that I couldn't understand myself? Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.. I got full confidence.. ..on your knowledge, on your personality,.. ..on the way that you understood me. You start writing the book. I will give you the necessary information. (Harmonium playing) What is it, Lakshmi? Why are you so happy? The dream that I have been dreaming of for so many years has come true today. That's why I am very happy. - What dream, Lakshmi? To meet Mr. Ramarao.. ..and write a book about his life.. ..my wish to convey his life to future generations.. ..and dream has come true today. Oh, did Mr. Ramarao agree for.. ..writing his book? - Yes, dear. What a great news, Lakshmi. Such a great man's history.. ..is being written by my wife. I am proud to say that. I can imagine how you would be feeling about it. You are feeling proud of it. But I am going to feel as a responsibility. (Chuckles) (Phone rings) Hello. - Is it Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi? The complete information that you need will be given by.. ..my PA Mohan, and I told him. He will call you. Swamy, just now I was telling my husband about you. He was overwhelmed when I told him that I am writing a book about you. Swamy, please talk to him once. Sir, greetings. - How are you? We are very good, Sir. Just now Lakshmi told me that you agreed to write a book on you. Yes. Not just on my life,.. ..even on human's life.. ..the deep awareness and thought that she has.. ..I liked it so much. That's why I agreed. Very happy Sir. 'Not willing to kill..' 'I don't want victory and happiness of a king..' '..and left down the bow and arrow.' 'Seeing Arjuna doing this, Lord Sri Krishna..' Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.. ..after you spoke to me the other day.. ..my heart was at peace. After so many years of struggle and tiredness.. ..with a happiness that I got a person who understands my mind.. ..after so many days.. ..I got some heal to my heart. Swamy, if you speak like this.. ..I don't know why but my heart is sad, but never happy. I am always your devotee. You have to accept our service, but.. ..never be disappointed alone. Even now, your words,.. ..are giving peace to my heart, Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi. I am giving you peace at this time means.. ..I am happy from one side, but sad as well. Swamy,.. ..I have a request for you. Tell me. I want to see you in power again. I already told you Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.. ..that I don't have any.. ..craze for power or seat. Swamy, because of the inability of current government.. ..people are suffering a lot. I heard many saying that you are 1000 times.. ..better than them. It is your responsibility to save your people, Swamy. You call for the cadets of different districts,.. ..and party heads, speak to them.. ..and listen to the situation in the State. In this situation, for this state.. ..your dream of eradicating poverty,.. ..only you can do it. Please ask everyone with a little patience.. ..try to know everything and think about it. On behalf of normal people like me.. ..this is just my request. Greetings, Babu Sir. What is it brother, how are you? - I am good. Elder brother.. Greetings, elder brother. What brother, how are you? If we have your blessings, we will be great. (Chuckles) Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi. She is writing my biography. You are doing a good work. People need the history of elder brother. Elder brother, you have to act in our next movie. No, brother. I am not interested. Elder brother, please, listen to me once. - Hmm. Swamy, you told this many times. You are for the people.. ..and your service is not just through politics.. ..but has to be done through movies also. - Hats off. You said it very well. Elder brother, don't say anything else. You are doing this movie. I will go and make necessary arrangements. Our movie will be a super hit, elder brother. Srimannarayana. Dear. You don't know how pure he is at heart. I wonder if such pure persons will be there in this world. But, such person.. ..was left by his own family. I think, because of the defeat in elections.. ..or because he was depressed, they might have parted a bit. What is it, Lakshmi? It is in bad time that.. ..his family should be with him. Yes, but.. ..why do we need his personal details? At least speaking about the book I am writing,.. ..he is coming out of it again. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. How are you? - I am good. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Please pardon me, father-in-law. I was late because of party work. That's fine. How is party work going on? They are going well. They are recovering now. Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi. She is writing my biography. He is my younger son-in-law, Babu. Greetings. - Greetings. Babu, in the coming elections.. ..we should take care that no mistakes happen from low level. Sure. - I was discussing on it with them till now. Explain Babu about all that we discussed. One more thing. I am participating in movie shooting very soon. She is cooking and other works at home, it seems. Some of our people are saying.. ..both are spending time at home itself, from morning to night. They are discussing something always. 'Greetings everyone.' 'Sumalatha is the one reading news.' 'All India Radio, Hyderabad center.' 'Now the time is nine in the night. Since there was continuous rain from evening in Hyderabad.. ..some roads were broken. So, some travels were objected. - (Thunder crashing) People has to take necessary care.. It's raining heavily outside. They are saying that roads got blocked. It's not safe for you to go at this time. I will call to your home and inform your husband. (Phone rings) (Thunder crashing) (Phone rings) Hello. - Mr. Rao, this is Ramarao. Sir, you called at this time? Is Lakshmi fine, Sir? I called you to inform the same. It's raining heavily outside. They are saying that the roads are blocked. That's why I am arranging her stay here itself. Okay, Sir. I can understand the situation. Thanks, Sir. (Call bell rings) Mohan. - Sir. Arrange a room for Lakshmi Parvathi downstairs. Okay, Sir. Please come, madam. It seems, she is with your father even in the nights. Where did she come from and hung here? She must be brought on road and peel her. - Who is that dare enough? Who is her? We are many children and can't we do anything to her? What can we do? (Chuckles) You said Kalakendram is ready. When is first kacheri? I thought to discuss the same with you. Everything is done. On the day of first show,.. ..you have to see that Mr. Ramarao.. ..will be there as chief guest. I will ask him for sure. He also loves arts and artists. (Chuckles) I will leave now, elder brother. Swamy. I don't know if this is right time to raise this request. I even don't know if I am eligible for it or not. What are you talking about, Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi? You have the familiarity that you can ask for anything. Ask it with courage. Swamy.. ..my husband has constructed a Kalakendram. We wish that the inauguration should be done.. ..on your hands. What's in that? I will happily come. You make arrangements. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. (Applause) - Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. (Applause) - Hail NTR. I salute all those sisters,.. ..and brothers of mine.. ..who are here today. Great salutes, salutes by an artist. (Applause) Today, I am here as an artist,.. ..as a person who loves art. Mr. Veeragandham Subbarao constructed this Kalakendram with an ambition. With respect on his ambition, I came here. (Applause) Mainly.. ..the respect and honour that I have.. ..to Mr. Veeragandham Subbarao's wife,.. ..Lakshmi Parvathi, made me come here. This couple has interest in arts.. ..and the perseverance to do something to society. Seeing this, I was very happy. (Applause) There is an artist in every human. There is an artist in every one of you, who is here today. I appreciate Veeragandham Subbarao.. ..and Lakshmi Parvathi couple, who constructed this Kalakendram,.. ..which enhances the talents of the artists. (Applause) Some after all person did some Kacheri.. ..you went there that she invited you. Without writing a name directly.. ..some papers already started writing about them both. Whispers started even in the party, Sir. Just listen to the whispers. Don't react now. Have some tea. Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, why do you seem like this? Swamy, was there any obscenity,.. ..in our behaviour or in words? Why are they writing about us in papers? When we are sharing our thoughts with each other.. ..with pure hearts with clean words and many spiritual things. Why are they writing in newspapers like that.. ..as if we did some wrong thing.. ..so baselessly? - Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi.. ..every human who is getting good name, faces some issues.. ..and this is also one. How, if you feel sad for such small thing? When we both know what it is for both of us.. ..why should we consider about others? In Dana, Veera, Soora Karna, Mr. Kondaveeti Venkatakavi gave a dialogue. Street dog.. ..shouts with no knowledge of good and bad. (Chuckles) In my cine and political life.. ..I have seen many things like this. Not just newspapers and opposition.. ..even my family members.. ..and my dear ones as well.. ..always tried to insult me and my personality. What you have to understand is.. ..we live for ourselves. Not for others who don't understand. Don't know, Swamy. The stableness that you are showing in this matter.. ..I am unable to maintain it for myself. It might be for the reason that I am facing it for the first time. But this is not for me. Who am I? But on you.. ..with such blames on you, I am unable to bear it. Lakshmi, the fame that I have will not become disgrace, because of you. Don't care such thoughts. These are very normal in politics. Unnecessarily.. ..don't think much about it and spoil your heart. If you feel sad, I can't see it. But the people won't believe the news that comes in this newspaper. They know.. ..what's truth and what's lie. Listen to me. Stop feeling sad. I can't see the tears in your eyes. Lakshmi, as he said, some say many things. Don't consider anything. When we know what we are, why care if others say other things? "Your existence is the meaning of my life." "Your entry is like a heaven to me." "Your poems are like sandal smell of flowers." "Your words.." "..are like a book of friendship to me." "This relationship is blooming and showering nectar." "Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my dear friend, you are everything to me." "This relationship is blooming and showering nectar." "Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my dear friend, you are everything to me." (Music) "Like a morning for the rays,.." "..you are like movement to my heart." "Like a victory to movement, like an ending to a story.." "..you are the same for the heart." "The life is blooming and the confluence is happy." "It's a celebration with no ending." "You are everything to me." (Music) "Like the world to sky, like the wind to the world,.." "I will always stay in you only." "Like a sound in my heart, like a 'diya' in my heart temple.." "..you are in my thoughts, you know?" "Wow this moment is very beautiful." "it's an unbeatable nectar." (Music) "This relationship is blooming and showering nectar." "Only the lighting 'diya' is left, my dear friend, you are everything to me." Lakshmi, for the many conflicts that I am facing.. ..I see you as a solution to those. When and how will the life turn.. ..is unknown to anyone. But, some turns give meaning to life. ..and give memories, happiness and peace with only few. That peace is felt by me, in every moment I talk to you.. ..and every moment I see your smiling face. Many times.. ..I regret for entering politics. My wife, Tarakam warned me. Why do we need these politics? Act as many days as you want.. ..and stay at home happily after that. Oh no. Don't say like that, Swamy. Not to stay at home.. ..your incarnation is to win this world. He is getting closer to her, day by day and month by month. But what do they talk daily for hours together? There will not be any words to speak when a male and female come together. But, he, who has contacts with beautiful ladies, Sridevi, Jayasudha, Jayaprada.. ..what did he find in her? We have to do something soon. Correct time should come for anything. Time will not come. We have to bring it. If you say yes, I will go and talk to him. I am not as great as to interfere in your personal matters.. ..but it's a unavoidable situation. I am here to speak to you on behalf of family members and party cadre. You are a big star. But a bigger politician. For great people like you, there's no chance to know what's happening behind. Only small people like us will know it. She is not a good lady, like you think. I came to know when enquired. She has affairs with many, before. Leave about her affairs. Tell me about your affairs that you are doing.. ..with my political enemies. Remember one thing. If you point one finger to others.. ..four fingers point you. I don't need the report.. ..that you or your spies.. ..give me. I am not a fool to not understand.. ..a person's inner feelings. He is blindly supporting her, means.. ..not just politically.. ..but even personally means dead. Lakshmi. I can't just ignore that everyone says anything. Because of me, I don't want your name to be smashed by any idiots. Lakshmi, I need to talk to you about an important matter. (Song playing on radio) (Thunder crashing) I need to talk to you about an important matter. Why do you hesitate to tell me? Tell me, Lakshmi. Mr. Ramarao asked me to marry him. What did you say, Lakshmi? I said I will think about it. What is there to think, Lakshmi? Don't you know that you are married? Don't you know that you have a son? I don't know if it's right or wrong. Only thing I know.. ..is that more than you, me or my son.. ..I care for his happiness only. (Thunder crashing) The moment you told me about marriage.. ..I got separated from my husband physically and mentally. Now, there's necessity to get separated lawfully. I decided to marry Lakshmi. Only after deciding that she is perfect for me, in all ways.. ..I came to this decision. I expect you all to respect my decision. Father. - Hmm. Look. She is not expecting anything from me.. ..other than my happiness. From the day of your mother's death.. ..don't you know the loneliness that I had experienced. As a father, I did all responsibilities of mine. I am marrying her.. ..only for myself. Because of this.. ..except getting support in this age.. ..nobody will get any kind of loss. Father, if you have desire for ladies, even at this age.. ..we will get you a good lady. But not like her.. - Shut up. I am leaving you just with respect on your mother. How dare you talk to me like that, about a lady I respect? Get lost. Please go away. Don't show me your faces again. Lakshmi. I told them, not for their permission. Just because it's my responsibility to convey them the matter, as a father. They are not matured to understand the sacred relation between us. Why do you think of them? I expect only one thing from you. Tomorrow if they come face to face and say something.. ..do not feel bad for it. Swamy, the love that you have on me.. ..is great strength to me. But since I am an outsider.. ..and your family is parting from you, because of me. Lakshmi. I know who is mine and who is an outsider. She must have trained him on what to talk to us. He took this decision, without even informing us. That means.. She trapped him by saying some magical words. The question is.. ..if she did it or he made her do it? Whatever it is, we have to do her something. If we want to do, we should not delay. Come, dear. Father is upstairs. I will call him right away. Stop your drama. Don't try to cheat us, like you cheated our father. What did I do? - Shut up. You did everything and asking what you did? What an acting.. You did black magic on our father and turned him to you. I will kill you. Not like this.. If you don't leave the house, you will die in our hands. Did you understand? (Gasps) Lakshmi, what happened? Nothing. Some bad dream. What dream? Some dream. I forgot. Look into my eyes and tell me the truth. Promise on me. In my dream, your family threatened to kill me. But this is just a dream. (Chuckles) What's surprising in this? We should be surprised if they don't do it. I felt very ashamed listening to what they said about you. If they had still crossed their limits, I would have beat them. But who are they to.. (Groans) Swamy, Swamy. What happened, Swamy? Swamy, what happened? Swamy. Sister Kamala.. Swamy, Swamy. Sir. - Swamy. Sir. What happened? Please get up. Please get up. What happened Sir? Hold me, Sir. What happened Sir? Sleep here, Sir. Sir, what happened? Sir. Okay, madam. - Call the doctor immediately. What happened doctor? Doctor. Can you please stay outside for ten minutes? (Crying) Doctor, what happened? - It's a mild stroke. Let's shift him to hospital immediately. I will go and make arrangements. Don't worry, Lakshmi. Crying is never a solution to a problem. Sir, I need to make arrangements to admit you in hospital. Mohan, this matter should not be leaked out at any cost. Sure, Sir. What is this? Mohan, go out and close the door. Okay, Sir. Lakshmi, my fear is.. ..if they know that I am very sick.. ..when I am in hospital.. ..and in operation room.. ..they might fulfill your dream. I am unable to bear even the thought of it. Lakshmi. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Don't mistake the words I say,.. ..or my love.. ..or the meaning behind my words. Please don't mistake me. Lakshmi. If I get a stroke again.. ..there is a chance that I may die. Lakshmi. Listen to what I am saying and go back.. ..to him and your son. If you stay with me.. ..the day I can't protect you.. ..they will surely kill you. (Crying) Swamy, good or bad, there is a bond between us. We reached here, crossing many obstacles. You know that I didn't come into your life.. ..seeing your glory. I don't care what everyone says. For this life, life or death is only with you, Swamy. Leaving you alone is more than death for me. Please don't punish me like this, for the crime that I didn't commit. Lakshmi. I decided not to die. As long as you are alive.. ..I promise that I will be alive. Till now.. ..we came together. From now, we will fight together. Let's go to hospital. Sir had a mild stroke. They are doing some tests. If needed, they will do a small surgery. There is nothing to worry. For now, he is fine. Let's see. Many elders will come to see him. If they see you here, it will be a problem. What sin did we do? Why are you killing us like this? Will you not leave unless you kill him? She is not the type who listens to words, brother-in-law. Hey, if you don't go away, I will hold your neck and push away. If you beat or stab or kill me.. ..I am here only to serve him. Unless he says.. ..I will listen to anyone else. Hey. - Lakshmi. What is it, Swamy? This is my last warning to you all. There is no necessity for any of you to come here to see me. Go away from here. (Heart Monitor beeping) Greetings, Sir. Greetings, elder brother. Greetings, dear. Is your health fine now? - It's better. What is it, Babu? What's the matter? By the blessings of Shirdi Sainath.. ..everything is going fine, elder brother. Our movie, Major Chandrakanth.. ..is successful, and on this event.. ..we have decided to do an event at Tirupathi. I came here to check for the date which is comfortable for you.. ..and arrange it accordingly. Do you think people will come for Tirupathi event? Since the movie is a great hit.. ..even now, people has.. ..craze on him. Sir. Leave about the decrease in craze.. ..our cadre is saying that the craze has increased. As per Tirupathi guys, the estimate is that.. ..people will be there in huge numbers. Then, to our party, which lost.. ..let's use that stage to get new energy. Since he is not in a stage to listen to us.. ..let's ignore what happened.. ..stay close to him and respecting him. I feel that would be better. We totally agree with what you say, brother-in-law. Give me that file. Elder brother, to sit on the stage tomorrow.. ..I thought of them as guests. Babu, give me a pen. Why did you come here? At first, on behalf of all of us.. ..we came here to ask for excuse for whatever happened till now. We couldn't understand then. But now we understood. But we doubt if the people will understand or not. What does that mean? - That means.. ..we saw the list who will be sitting on the stage. Her name is also there in it. Already there is news that you both have some relation, in newspapers.. ..in party and in opposition, there are different news. If they see her beside you now.. ..those news will be proved as truth. After the defeat in previous elections.. ..we are gaining the status, and it'll be lost. With your image and age in your view, please think about it. Father, if you want, let her sit in the people below stage. But not on to the stage. If people see her on stage, we need not be surprised if they spit on us. They might even come on stage and might assault. 'My land is great and I salute it.' 'My land is worth and I always remember it.' 'My land is great and I salute it.' - (Applause) 'My land is worth and I always remember it.' 'My country is my mother and I salute it.' 'My country is mother food and I always remember it.' 'My country gave birth to a number of great people.' 'My country has a great history, yes, my country.' Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. (Applause) (Applause) I thank you all who upheld this movie like this. I expected such a great hit of this movie.. ..when elder brother agreed to do this movie. Hail NTR. For giving me such a luck.. ..I am thankful to elder brother. Hail NTR. Now, elder brother will share his feelings. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. All your hearts.. ..are very happy and I know that. To say about Major Chandrakanth.. ..regarding the plans for coming elections.. ..there is a necessity to speak about many matters. But, before everything else.. ..at this time of happiness.. ..in this sacred place of Tirupathi.. ..at the feet of that Edukondalu.. ..I need to share a very important matter with you all. I am going to invite a person on to the stage. Lakshmi. Who is Lakshmi? - Who is it? Her name is Lakshmi Parvathi. I met her a few days back. We shared our hearts. We decided to get married. We need your blessings. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Lakshmi, go and get ready. I will tie you knot in front of everyone. "Righteously.." "..financially.." "..by desire.." "I will not walk away." (Music) "Vasantha raag for winter.." "Cuckoo sing in winter night." "The eclipse leaves the lonely heart." "Getting married to lovable person." "This bond is of which birth" "This is a sweet sandal." "The destination shows the way.." "This marriage is conducted by heaven." "This marriage is conducted by heaven." (Music) "Like a God in silver curtain.." "You are the shining star." "The only intention is to rule righteously." "You are the walking Rama in this Kaliyug." "You are the star and you are Rama." "You are the Taraka Rama." Hail NTR. He did what he said. What do we do now? In front of the craze that he has in people.. ..whatever we say or do, there is no use. In the situation that we are in, except waiting for time.. ..there is nothing else to do. I am frustrated to even imagine her beside him. From tomorrow, we have to see her in papers and TV. Disgusting. Elder brother, I take the responsibility of Rajamundry meeting. But a small request. Please bring sister-in-law to this meeting. Why me? Why, madam. You have to come. Lakshmi, you are my wife. Wherever I am, you should be there. They are arranging a meeting in Rajamundry. She gave that idea, it seems. He is starting holding her saree in hand. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. Hail NTR. - Speak along with sister-in-law. Speak along with sister-in-law. Speak along with sister-in-law. My husband, who is on stage, Mr. NTR.. (Applause) ..to the elders who came here, to those who arranged this meeting.. ..to the cadets of 'Mana Desam Party', to the leaders.. ..I salute to the people who admire and respect Mr. Ramarao. Hail Mana Desam. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail Mana Desam. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail Lakshmi Parvathi. Seeing you all today, I remember.. ..a poem written by Mr. Jashua. With what work he stepped into this world.. ..he has to be asked immediately after he starts walking. With what work he stepped into this world.. ..he taught everything even before asking. If her status in the party increases with same rate.. ..my political life will be submerged. I don't care what you do. Number of news against her should come out. For that, when I become the Chief Minister.. ..you will get what you have to get. Okay. Leave it to me. I will take care of it. Send information about Kurnool meeting to everyone.. ..even to party heads. We've to start victory from this meeting. - Swamy. Now you can leave. - Okay Sir. What is this Swamy? I am running domination in the party.. ..and they wrote that Rajamundry meeting is Lakshmi Parvathi's entry to politics. I have been thinking of asking you about this since many days. But now, since it is time, I am asking you. What is the reason behind the gap.. ..between you and the owner of this paper? When I became the Chief Minister.. ..he tried to do authority on me. But I didn't agree for that. So.. ..now, he is doing wrong campaign on me. Enmity with media is not good for.. ..you and the party, Swamy. If you meet and speak, that would be better. Lakshmi. I have seen many jackals like him. If they growl.. ..there will be no loss for me and my party. For me, people are important. Thinking that some people are able.. ..I left some decisions to them. But, that ability went wrong way.. ..and the corrupt politics that they played.. ..gave a great loss to the party. I ignored whatever they did.. ..all these days. But by the next elections time.. ..the corruption and the bribery in the party.. ..has to be removed completely. I will concentrate myself on it. That's it. Not on the people who publish wrong news. He doesn't take bribes. So if he doesn't allow others to take.. ..then how will we lead our lives? He kept the complete power in his hands.. ..and leaving us with such popularity, he is trusting those who are not known. Some Atchaiah Chowdary it seems. Under his leadership, some meeting is being conducted at Khairatabad. Devi, go there tomorrow.. ..create pandemonium and enrage his razzle. What if I enrage? In the rage of anger, he will take some decision. What kind of decision? Devi, listen to me carefully. Elder brother said that he will take care to resolve many pending plans. Even we go in his way and.. - Who gave permission for this meeting? Go away. - What is this? Are you threatening us? Who asked you to conduct this meeting? - What is this? Mr. NTR. - This is my office, my area. The authority of this complete area is mine. Without my permission, who are you and that NTR to conduct this meeting? Talk properly. Don't you have respect for him? - Why should I respect you and him? You conduct meeting at my office, without my permission? Go away? What is it, man? - Leave me. Leave my shirt first. Hey, I will break you. I am telling you. What happened brother? I will suspend from the party immediately. Mohan. - Swamy, please don't be emotional. Take decision peacefully. Such a big punishment to suspend from party? You don't know Lakshmi. You don't interfere into this. Suspension has to be done. Just because Lakshmi Parvathi said.. ..NTR suspended me from the party. NTR is not in that party. - (Camera clicks) Only she is there. She is making NTR play like a doll. That's it. Party will get destroyed. Go away. - (Camera clicks) (Camera clicks) For physical relation.. ..or for some personal perpetration.. ..I didn't marry her. I married her for my mental peace. For that, so many accusations on us? Devi insulted me and my party. That's why I suspended her from the party. Is it wrong? It's very wrong to point Lakshmi.. ..and talk for this. She says and you believe it and write in paper. At least from now.. ..in any matter.. ..don't publish anything without knowing the truth. Her suspension should be a lesson to all of you. I should never hear about group politics in the party. That's why I am cancelling the State committees. From now any decision in the party.. ..will not take place without my knowledge. That's why I am establishing the Adhoc committee. This time, even in the case of seats as well.. ..I will give the decision by myself. My decisions will be declared to you very soon. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. Hail NTR. - Hail Mana Desam. All the decisions that she tells him in the bedroom.. ..are being declared in the hall by him. But still, what experience does she have to take such decisions? Is experience required to say rubbish? Are we part of the party? If all decisions are taken by.. ..her in the kitchen, then why us? (Phone rings) (Phone rings) I am announcing the candidates list. You all come home. Okay, sir. With respect on me and my party.. ..those who worked with commitment.. ..I declare them as the party candidates. Vijayanagaram - Vijaya Gajapathi Raju. Rajamundry - Atchaiah Chowdhary. Chittoor - Chinni Krishna. Prakasam - Venkateswara Naidu. Medchal - Ravinder Goud. Pradeen - Pratap Ravi. Vijayawada - Somineni Nehru. Khammam - Meera Bai. Indragiri - CB Naidu. Kurnool - Santosh Reddy. Bobbili - Ramappa Naidu. After so many years, we are left with mud. There is not even one more than 10-15 persons.. ..from the list. That means, does he feel that we are useless? Not, that means. It is. Publicise the news that.. ..she gave all the names.. ..and publish it in your paper. Okay. (Crying) I already told you, right? Whatever anyone says.. ..whatever anyone writes.. ..people are on our side. Let's concentrate on elections. NTR. - NTR. NTR. - NTR. NTR. - NTR. (Music) "Roar." "Roar." "It's the roar of a lion."

How many accusations did they do about you? This great victory is like a slap on all their faces. Lakshmi, you are my Goddess. You brought back my happiness, my health and my authority. Truly, you came into my life.. ..like goddess Lakshmi. "Happiness rouse in the hearts today." (Music) Me.. I, Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao,.. ..do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that.. ..do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that.. ..as per the Constitution of India.. - ..as per the Constitution of India.. ..that I will bear true faith and allegiance.. ..that I will uphold the sovereignty.. ..and integrity of India,.. ..conscientiously discharge my duties.. ..as Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.. ..without fear or favour,.. ..affection.. ..or ill-will.. ..in accordance with the Constitution and the law.. ..that I will do right to all manner of people.. ..I swear this with my pure heart. Hail NTR. - (Applause) I will take care of it. What is he thinking.. ..what decision is he taking.. ..I am unable to understand it. There is no use even after winning. The main matter more important of these.. ..is, for every meeting.. ..he is taking her with him. So.. ..these foolish people are.. ..thinking that she is the political heir of him. After his death.. ..she might become the leader. Then, how to separate her? Even I don't understand the same. These days he is not even allowing me near him. Greetings, Sir. That's fine. - Sorry Babu, I got late in the court. What is it, Babu, you came here suddenly? What is it? You seem like you are tensed. Sir. For the mistakes I did.. ..Mr. Ramarao is not talking to me. May be for what I said long back about Lakshmi Parvathi. What is there that you don't know. I need your help at this time. You are very close to Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi, right? You just speak to her once. (Phone rings) Hello. - Hello, sister, how are you? I am good, brother. How are you? I am first class. We are all good. Tell me, brother. You called me after so many days. I will ask you something. Can you do me that favour? Why do you say like that, brother? If I can do it, I will surely do it. Tell me. His father-in-law is not talking to Babu.. ..so to explain few things, he want to talk to you, sister. Just for my sake, talk to him about everything.. ..and I request to clear all the misunderstandings. I am handing him the phone. Please talk to him. Hello. Tell me, Babu. Madam, for what I said to him long back against you.. ..he is very angry with me. I mistook and.. ..I spoke on behalf of everyone. But I didn't do it intentionally. If I am kept away from party works at this time.. ..I don't find another way other than going back.. ..to Chittoor and do some business. He should forget all that I said to him listening.. ..to some bad people. Please. No, Babu. Some day you will know the truth.. ..and he is eagerly waiting for it. I didn't do anything wrong. I stepped into your.. ..father-in-law's life very sacredly. For what I said against you, please excuse me. Very happy, Babu. My quest is that he should get close to his family members. If we all get together, he will be at peace. His health will recover even speeder. Babu, I don't know about these political issues. I am just his associate. Tell me what should I do. You have to speak to him somehow. Please. - I understood. But he has many distrusts on you. There is a necessity to prove your commitment. Please promise me first.. ..that you will not harm as long as he is alive. If he is not there, I don't exist, madam. I promise on my son, Lokesh, that I will never do.. ..anything that hurts him. Your son-in-law spoke to me. (Coughs) Who? Babu? Yes. He asked me to pardon him. Why is that? Did you become good, all of a sudden? For everyone's good, we have to adjust ourselves. Did you forget, what he did and what he said about us? Poor lady. What do you know about these politics? Your character is like who imagine that all that is white is milk. He is an expert in this. He is of the type who catches hair, when he reaches or feet when he can't. He used to say very bad things about you. Instead of feeling ashamed to come near you.. ..that is his politics. He prays to the feet and pulls the legs. Instead of thinking about yourself.. ..why do you bother about someone else? Poor lady. What happens if you rear a snake, pouring milk? It will bite you back. That is his nature. Look. Now the party is in authority. The papers are publishing whatever they want about our family.. ..in papers every day. In this situation, we have to adjust little for the good of everyone. My good got mixed with your good. After our marriage, if there is any loss for you.. ..I will be the one who will be sad. He promised on his son. He will be trusted associate of yours. Please pardon him for this time. Okay. You are asking me for this. So I will pardon him for your sake. Ask him to come here once tomorrow. Father-in-law, please pardon me. From now, I will never involve in.. ..your personal matters. If you stay good.. ..why will we stay away from you? Leave personal matters. Don't forget that we are here for people. Let's all work together unitedly. Sure. Greetings. I am not habited to coffee and tea. What's your plan.. ..in gaining his confidence by working hard, Sir? If we stay close to enemy.. ..we can hit him hard. Greetings, madam. - Greetings. Please come. Come, madam. Tell me. What happened? Something is bad in eyes. Since when? - Since this morning. Please come once. I will check. She went to hospital for pain in eyes. We got confirmed news that.. ..she went to hospital for confirmation on pregnancy. If she gives birth to a boy.. ..your complete family will finish. Because, he will become the heir. He will write all the assets to him. Your inheritance will be given to him. With that, your complete family will be gone. For you, in the efforts of stopping her.. ..I need 100% support. Not just 100%, you will get 1000%. I am also with you, brother-in-law. With this, the complete family will be in my fist. They will listen to only what I say. What an idea, Mr. Babu. Why don't I get these? If you also get them, you would have been in my place, right? At first, what we need to do is.. ..to campaign negatively about them. With some MLAs,.. ..we have to start rebelling. Look about it. Swamy. In TV and papers, they are saying that.. ..I am the reason for the dissatisfaction in the party. I will leave for few days, Swamy. Lakshmi don't talk like stupid. You are a wedded wife of mine. For the dramas that they are playing for expedience.. ..why should we bend our heads? Not that, Swamy. Disgracing you for my sake.. ..I am unable to bear it. If I alone am not there.. ..your family and your party cadre will be with you only, right? Lakshmi. You don't understand these politics. I told you many times. You are raising the same conversation again and again. Please try to understand. They are repeatedly poking like crows. What do I do? I will go away, Swamy. Lakshmi. You asked me not to get defeated.. ..and is it lawful for you to step backward? Lakshmi. To make us suffer and to defeat us.. ..this is the plan of the opposition. If you leave because some guy wrote useless things.. ..it will be like killing our soul. For this life, you are my wife. I say this with proud and without fear. You leave. He will check it. We will leave now, Sir. Please sit down. What is Mr. Elder saying? All the works that we planned with eight MLAs.. ..against the party came to his notice. He came to know about all the works that we planned for. I could know that he is in doubt that.. ..I am behind all this. Today it happened to you eight of them. Tomorrow it might happen to others as well. Since you all are dear to me.. ..I am telling you. You spent so much money.. ..in elections.. ..and to get them back.. ..if you don't get what you need, then what is the way? The confirmed news that came to me is.. ..the whole money.. ..is being eaten by Lakshmi Parvathi alone. If it goes like this, then we are finished. So, removing him from his seat,, ..is the only way. That is impossible. You are saying this Babu, after seeing the popularity that he has in people? There is only one way to make people believe. Let's use Lakshmi Parvathi,.. ..whom he believes a lot, as a knife. How is it, Babu? I will tell you. Listen to me. First you three go and speak to him.. ..that if she is not kept aside from party works.. ..tell him that there will be disturbance in the party. Tell him that there will be opposition. We had to tell you as it is, elder brother. That is, elder brother. Some people in the party.. ..are against you. The only reason for this is.. ..Mrs. Lakshmi Parvathi taking authority. Lakshmi's authority? Where? In which matter? Can you tell me on whom did she show it? With a frustration that I suspended them from party.. ..as they couldn't say anything directly.. ..they are talking with Lakshmi as the reason. But listening to someone else.. ..do you think I am a fool to take decisions .. ..about party and people? The only thing they want is authority and money. Using that, they will steal people's money. Since I am an obstruction to them, they are doing all this. If Lakshmi was not there, they would have searched for some other reason. It all happened as you said. He didn't agree to send her away. If he had agreed to it.. ..what would have happened to our main purpose? I sent you because I didn't want him to agree. If this comes out any time.. ..we will get a fame that we gave him a chance. Governor Sir, there is a lot of opposition against him. I have the majority of support in the party. No problem. The centre already asked me to support you in this matter. Thank you, Sir. It is true that there is opposition in the party, but.. ..I doubt if they will oppose.. ..him directly and support me. The confirmed support that I have in MLAs.. ..is only a few of them. But the news that they are increasing hour by hour.. ..should be publicised, using.. ..your TV and paper. Okay. - If you support me in this matter.. ..not just in the form of money, but in other ways.. ..also, I will give you that you can't even imagine. In Viceroy hotel, with a tension that there are many MLAs.. ..some more MLAs also.. ..are changing their minds.. ..and going to that hotel. If this continues, from Mr. Nandamuri Taraka Ramarao.. ..the power will change hands. This is experts thoughts. There are many on Babu's side. Observing all this.. - Sir, the situation.. ..is going out of hands. We need to find a solution for this problem. Brother. I believe my MLAs. All that is coming in TV is by that newspaper owner.. ..and that cheater together.. ..is the drama that is being played to fool the people. The MLAs who won on my name will not cheat me. Sir, more than the thought of cheating you.. ..with the fake news coming in TV and paper.. ..many MLAs will believe that.. ..if all MLAs shift to Babu, they fear that they will be left alone.. ..and it is known that everyone is joining Babu individually. 'What will Mr. NTR do in this situation is ..' Chandrababu's leadership should win. Chandrababu's leadership should win. He demanded the Governor that he will prove that.. ..he has the support of majority of MLAs. The Governor has agreed for.. ..floor test to prove his majority. With a fear that they might change their minds listening to someone.. ..to keep them away from meeting anyone till floor test.. ..all the MLAs were tied up in Viceroy hotel like a herd of sheep. Swamy, you have to go there immediately. Where? - To Viceroy hotel. Tell them the matter and only you can bring them out. Lakshmi, they were all selected by me. They are the MLAs who won the elections on my name. Should I beg them to stay with me? Swamy, they are doing this either with fear or without knowledge.. ..or by mistake, how do you know it? Since they are your MLAs,.. ..only you can explain them the matter. What sister-in-law said is true. Only you can do it. Then fine. Come. Swamy, no. When they are saying that this issue is because of me.. ..if I come even there, then it will do no good. Lakshmi, my life is an open book. Regarding me or regarding what I believe.. ..if I hide anything, it will be like hiding me from myself. For just seat if I hide this truth from the people.. ..then, what is the difference between him and me? Don't say anything. Just come with me. Hail NTR. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. Babu, down, down. - The Chief Minister is here. Open gates. This is a private place. You can't go inside. This is an order. You are all my brothers. I selected you all with lots of love. I am the one who made you stand in elections and gave you victory. Don't believe his magic words. There is nothing to be afraid of. Come out with courage. I will explain you. Babu, down, down. How can you do injustice to me? You grew up in my hands like my children. You are living life given by me and now, you are combining hands with that cheater. Just look into yourselves once. The history will never forget this betrayal of yours. This cheating will be there lifelong. Stop it. Swamy. Who is it? They killed me. They killed me. They killed me when I am alive. In spite of being my sons.. ..in spite of being my daughters.. ..in spite of being son-in-laws.. ..in spite of being the MLAs whom I gave victory.. ..everyone combinedly.. - Swamy. ..hit me with slippers and killed me. They killed me by hitting with slippers. "Imposture, imposture." "Cheating." "The belief, the belief.." "They stabbed in the back." "Insulted, insulted and stabbed in the back." "Conspiracy, conspiracy." "They hid and attacked fiercely." "They spit the poison of dirty politics." "They showed fake love acting.." "They gathered like Sakunis in kaliyugam." "The atrocity was fired.." "Is it possible to pardon?" "Imposture, imposture." (Music) "The dear ones fulfilled their necessity and left." "They showed their originality and then bit mercilessly." "They made lonely and attacked as a group.." "They exiled from own house." "Imposture, imposture." I am very sad for what happened to you. I know Babu well but.. ..I didn't expect that he will stab you in the back like this. It's not late even now. If they have to come under your control, you can do one thing. What do I do? - Abolish the government. What if I abolish it? If you abolish it, everyone will lose the membership and elections will be re-held. Your strength is people. So you will be elected as Chief Minister again. This will be a lesson for them. If you give it in written form,.. ..I will go to Delhi, meet Prime Minister.. ..and will recommend Governor. Our action plan is ready. I made him sign it. Sir, your signature was used in other way. If Assembly is dissolved, with a fear that you will not give them tickets.. ..with the insult that you faced at Viceroy hotel.. ..even the MLAs who changed their opinion supported Babu. Even center needed the same. So.. ..the Governor, without dissolving the government.. ..Babu was given a chance to prove majority. "You smashed the fort of justice and burnt it." "You dig a pit and buried the justice." "They hid like a jackal and.." "..killed the self honor and burnt it." "Imposture, imposture." (Music) (Crying) Why are you crying Lakshmi? Seeing your situation, I am unable to bear it, Swamy. Lakshmi, everyone is concerned about their selfishness. Look at my children. They combined hands with the one who stabbed me in the back. Is it for them that.. ..I melted myself.. ..and gave out my life? What wrong did I do? Why are they torturing me like this? Your heart knows.. ..that you did no wrong. Even now, I can't understand.. ..the loss that I did to the party. Lakshmi, the mouth of lies is bigger. The hands of injustice are longer. Even if you were not in my life.. ..they might have cheated me in some other way. Now they used you. That's it. Don't cry. Swamy, I am unable to see you.. ..crying like this. There is only one solution for this problem. People believed you and voted for them. They stabbed in the back,.. ..but it's not you that they stabbed but the people. The people who gave you authority.. ..you have to tell them about this. The dirty politics is worse than adultery. It is a crime against people. It is bigger crime than betraying the country. I am not myself. I am my people. Those people made me this today. But, today, he,.. ..with dirty politics, with machination and deceived.. ..they stabbed me on my back. He stabbed not my back but my people. That's why, to explain the injustice done to my people.. I am going to roar like a lion. I will invite lakhs of people.. ..and will disclose his actual figure in that meeting. Hail Mana Desam. - Hail Mana Desam. There's meet in evening. Make arrangements. - Greetings, Babu. What happened? There's meet in Vijayawada, Simhagarjana. On the political issues that happened in last few days.. ..because of media support, our intelligence says that.. ..many people will be attending it. When he declared in the meeting, that he will marry Lakshmi Parvathi.. ..seeing the response he got.. ..after Simhagarjana meeting, people will attack us like an eagre. What if we don't give permission for meeting? It will be like, we declaring the stabbing by ourselves. People are his strength. You have to keep them at a distance from him. Rama, Rama, Ram. Rama, Rama. Rama, Rama. Rama, Rama. Rama, Rama. To stop our meeting and our arrangements.. ..it came to our knowledge that they are planning differently. Then, there is no need of making any kind of arrangements. Directly, I will talk to my people from my van. We have truth on our side. Nobody can stop truth. As per my view, it is better if you don't conduct the meeting. Why that? - People might not come at all. Why will people not come for his meeting? Because when they come from different places to attend your meeting,.. ..and after hearing your words.. ..the people might rebel on them and with this fear.. ..we came to know that he is going to use goons and police for this. In my age of more than 70 years.. ..if I turn back and look at my life once.. ..the only mistake that I did in my whole life.. ..is trusting him. For believing that single cheater.. ..I came to this position. The MLAs who won with my name.. ..he converted them as his weapon. My children.. ..and my family went against me.. Swamy. - Brother. Swamy. Swamy. (Crying) Swamy. I can't bear seeing you like this. I will die, if I see you like this. Even when you said, I didn't hear you.. ..and for asking you to take him back,.. ..please pardon me for this. No, Lakshmi. I know that you told this for my good. But he is a snake who drinks milk but spits poison. Even after knowing that, if I made him join my team.. ..that means, should I sold my wit.. (Crying) Lakshmi.. ..sleep beside me today. Mother. Come here and sleep on my chest. Are you sad, dear? As long as you are beside me, I will not have any sadness, Swamy. Lakshmi. I lived well in my life. I gave entertained people, as an actor. I gave true rule, as a leader. I always tried for their safety. But, only one.. ..for believing one person, I ruined myself. I feel like vacuum. Lakshmi. Don't go anywhere, anytime, leaving me. Swamy. Swamy. Swamy, Swamy. Sister Kamala. Swamy. Swamy. Sir, oh, no. - Doctor. Sir, what happened? Say something, Sir. Swamy, say something. - Sir. Swamy please get up. Yes, Sir. He is not speaking. Doctor, Swamy. Let me check. Sorry. Swamy. Swamy please get up once. (Wailing) Swamy. Daddy. Swamy - Daddy. Swamy. (Wailing) Swamy. Move away. Move. Daddy. Swamy. Move. (Wailing) Swamy. Swamy. Swamy. Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama. Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama. Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama. For this life, life or death is with you, Swamy. Leaving you is like more than death to me. Please don't punish me for the mistake that I have not done. Lakshmi. I decided not to die. As long as you are alive.. ..I promise that I will be alive. "Pardon me, Lakshmi. Pardon me, Lakshmi." "Pardon me, Lakshmi." "I gave you a word but couldn't stand by it. I am leaving now." "I had to leave my dear's love and leaving away." "Pardon me, Lakshmi. Pardon me, Lakshmi." "I was crushed in the bad wits.." "..and I am setting now." "Leaving the net of conspiracy and tricks.." "..I am leaving now." (Music) "Leaving you alone and pushing you into sadness.." "..I broke my heart and leaving crying." "I am leaving now." "Pardon me, Lakshmi." "Pardon me, Lakshmi." His body must have died.. ..but a great man's soul always lives in the hearts of people. For authority and for glory.. ..under the leadership of a man, seeing whom even demons feel shy.. ..because of the betrayal done by some animals.. ..who are in the incarnation of humans.. ..a great man like Rama, Mr. NTR.. ..was sacrificed for the mental torture and the true replica is.. ..this Lakshmi's NTR.
