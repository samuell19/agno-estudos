Rome is surrounded by a chain of borgate scattered across the countryside and hidden among the ruins. They are inhabited largely by migrants from the countryside and the south. At the end of 1943, when Rome was occupied by the Germans, people are starting to talk in one of these "borgate" about an hunchbacked 19-year-old young man who would later become one of the most vicious criminals of the postwar period. THE HUNCHBACK Attention L. 30,000 Alvaro Cosenza known as the Hunchback - Stop! - What do you want from me? I'm 4F. - Hands up! Leave me! I didn't do anything! - Leave me! - Walk! - Come with us. - I've not done anything. There's a mistake! I've done nothing! Leave me! Where do you want to take me? Leave me! I didn't do anything! The hump brings luck! Hunchback, come out. It'll be better for you. - My son isn't here. - Who's over there? There's no one. There's nobody there, I said! - Moretti!?! - I'm here! Come and get me, if you dare! Hey, Moretti, come on up here! Let's not be stupid here! Do we want to die!?! Come on, go to the terrace. When I send the signal, call him. Make fun of him, but don't shoot. We gotta have fun with him first. If they catch us, they'll smooth out your hump and turn us into hunchbacks! Pellaccia, hurry up, we've no time to talk. Hey, Moretti! Come on, Pellaccia! Come on? We'll break our necks! - Don't yell! Hold on to the gutter. Put your hand there, hold on tight. Don't be afraid. Let's go one by one, no shooting. You first. - Me? - Yes you. Go on. Scheggia, Pellaccia, where are you going? Where? We're going to crouch down, to hide. Should we risk our skin for fun? It's not over, it's just starting! He dared to come to our home so we'll go to his. Alvaro will have some fun! Pezze al culo, go away. - Why can't I Stay? - Not for what we're going to do. - Going with women, huh? - Come on, go away. I'm going, I don't give a damn anyway. Damned Hunchback, he screwed me over again. Get down from the ledge! - Do you hear that? - Who's he shooting? If he imagines that we are in his house... Who's there? Is it you dad? We have a letter for the Commander. No! Help! What are you looking for? What do you want? Where's your father? I don't know, he is outside on duty. I'll tell you where he is. He's out at night to hunt me down. Hey, look at this! It's good stuff. - Shut up! - Let me go! What are you running from, come here. No, no, no! I just want to have a little treat with you. Don't be afraid, we won't kill you. We won't waste you like that and it's your father's turn first. - Come on, let's get this over with! - Move! Come on, don't move or it's gonna be worse for you! Leave me alone! Take whatever you want, but leave me alone. I didn't do anything! I mind my own business. They'll tell you. Oh, yeah? So you know what we're going to do? We'll sit here and wait for your father to arrive. Then we'll deal with him directly Come on, get out. Go outside and keep watch. It's no use crying. If it was only worth it... we're going to stay thirsty... Armando, did you fall asleep? It's daylight! Why are you waiting to leave? Do you think I'll cry when you're gone? - Alvaro! - Send them away. - For goodness sake, send them away. - I can't. Your father's a bastard for them too. Let the other two ruin me too, but don't kill my father! I only have him. You took revenge on me, isn't that enough for you? What else do you want, tell me. Stop it, I can't hear you cry, Ninetta. Bye. Ah, finally! Did you leave us the crumbs? - Let's go. - Are we leaving? What? Now it's our turn. Don't tell me you fell in love with that? It's my business. What do you mean it's none of our business? Do you want to quarrel? No, but I've given it some thought. Nina... If those copies are for me, it's no use putting them aside because I can't read. You had me call, what's new? The command has given the order that you must leave this area. Never show yourself again in this borgata. Oh, what am I hearing? And why? Alvaro, you've never understood anything about the partisan struggle. You don't think you're part of an organization, that there are orders, that there is discipline. You wage war on your own. With the enemies you want and whenever you want. You're a danger to us too. You do nothing but damage. So all I do is damage? Because what I do you call damage. But I've terrorized the fascists around here. I've killed more Germans than all of you combined. All you do is paint paper with ink and distribute little manifestos. Eh, this is necessary too, to let everyone know why we fight. Yes... but it's also more convenient, eh? Well, Alvaro, you heard me. The command has spoken clearly. There is an order and it must be respected. You have to step aside with good or bad ways And if I don't give a fuck what'll you do? Are you going to shoot me? - If you want to provoke me... - All right, I'm leaving. I don't feel like getting you in trouble, okay? Alvaro, you must give me back the revolver Do you want us to stay unarmed? The Germans are looking for us too, you know? Leave them alone, pezze al culo. We'll make up for it in one swoop. I was really craving some new guns. We take weapons from the Germans, not the partisans. Are you afraid? If you can, get me a gun too. - I have a right. - All right. You always tell me it's fine. Like with kids, but never give me anything. That machine gun's mine, because I'm a friend in time of danger. Instead the others just to go and have fun with women. A pistol, machine gun, do you want a cannon too? Wait for me here. - Halt, there's a dead man! - There must be someone! Let's go find him! - Be careful! Where did they get you? They really hurt me, but I can still go on. Alvaro I'm scared! You're covered in blood! Damn! Leave, the Germans are coming now. Think about running away. Go! Hey, hey! Who's there? Who do you want? Alvaro is wounded, they shot him. You have to hide him. No, no, no, I can't here. They took my husband. Do you want to ruin these poor children? May they kill you all! - Alvaro! - I told you to leave. I went to ask for help, but they're all scared. Such cowards, they're scared, huh? Well, let's go to Ninetta's. She's the only one, help me. But she's a fascist, Alvaro. - You can't trust that one. - Do as I tell you, hurry up! I can't take it anymore. Nina! - Who's there? - Friends. - Is your father there? - Yes, why? Do you need him? What are you looking for here? No, I had to tell you something. But, if your father is here, I won't say anything. If he sent you, tell him I don't want to see him tonight or ever. He's wounded, the Germans would never look for him in your home! He only trusts you, now he even fights with friends over you. - You must hide him. - Did he tell you this? Tell the truth. He's gravely wounded, he can't even speak And he's bleeding! You don't want to believe me, huh? Look, his blood! It wasn't your father who shot him. It was the Germans. Nina who's there? You hear him? Leave now, leave! Who was it? A little boy who wanted some bread. You must never open the door at night. - Especially if I'm not around. - Why not? Because it's dangerous. Dad, dad, why don't we go away, why don't we change house, go back to the village? What will change? Someone like me makes enemies everywhere. so it's better to stay here! At least I know which are my friends and enemies. Dad, when will this end? When? Who knows? Maybe never, or the others will win. - Then why are you with them? - Who should I be with? And then who knows? The last word's not been said. A miracle can happen at any moment. But, are you going away again tonight? - Stay with me at least tonight. - Don't worry, don't be afraid. - Dad! - Huh? Tonight I'm more afraid for myself than for you. Close the windows tightly. And bolt the door and don't open it to anyone. - Bye. - Bye. Ninetta! Ninetta! Leave me alone, what do you want from me? Leave me alone! I don't know anything! - Ah, so you don't know anything? - No! So if you know nothing, if you're innocent, if you have nothing to do with the partisans, why not enlist with the militia now, to prove you've nothing to do with them. I'm scared to death, I don't want anyone to kill me! I don't want to end up badly! I think you'll end up badly this time anyway! Look, let's not waste any time. You're from the Hunchback gang, we have proof. You can save yourself by telling us where the Hunchback is, then you to go home. I don't know anything. How am I to tell you, by singing? Don't make me lose my temper. Speak, come on, make up your mind! The Germans are furious, understand? They want the guy who killed the sentry last night it's you or the hunchback, choose! If it wasn't you who killed the sentry why don't you say so? Marshal, have you gone crazy? We're four, let's play cards and never talk about it again. But who do you think? That we are clowns? Come on, let's make this a foursome. So, you want to tell us where the Hunchback is? No!I I won't say anything! No? You're really pissing me off! Speak! Go ask that shameless daughter of yours where the Hunchback is! Leave my daughter alone! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! What? What is it? I'm worried. I've been waiting all night and he hasn't returned yet. Don't worry, bad weed never dies. Imagine! Don't joke about these things. You scare me, you know? Everyone always talks about you. Then listen to what people say about me. Do you know what that means? It means that in this borgata I make day and night if I want. Ninetta, listen to me. you're the only one who needn't be afraid of me. I'll make you a queen, waited on and revered, if you stay close to me. Wait for the war to end and you'll see who I'll be. All the soldiers went out this morning. There were also about a hundred Germans. They turned the whole borgata upside down. Alvaro, you have to leave. I can't keep you here any longer. I'm sorry, but I can't. My father curses you all day long. I would like to tell him the truth, but... but I'm not capable of it. Not for you, but for him. Come, sit here. I don't want to think about anything. And you should stop worrying. Ninetta! Give me a kiss. Give me one , come on! Even if you don't care. Yet you should care. At least you should love me, I was the first man in your life. Even if you didn't want to, what can you do? That's the way it was. It's all that matters to me and you. A girl like you must have only one man in her life. Come and give me a kiss. Not like that, on the lips. No, not now, I can't. Why not? Think if something happened to him? If your friends... If I start to think, you become my enemy too. Me, but why? I'm healing you, I saved you. You saved me because you hope I won't kill your father, right? But you're always against me, even if you're close to me. I'm not with anyone. I stay with my father as I only have him. And he too has only me. Do you know how many people your father has on his conscience? Shall I make a list, I'd never end. A coward, a sell out to the Germans! Then leave, now! You can't say these things in my house. I'm the one who saved you, I'm his daughter! - And I can't believe you! - Nina! Stop! - Ninetta! - Don't move. Nina! Ninetta! Nin! I'll do whatever you want. But don't kill him. You have to promise me. Swear to me! It's fine, I swear. Word of the Hunchback. Now that you've sworn, I can also tell you. What do you have to say? Alvaro, what had to happen happened. I'm pregnant. What did you say? No, I don't believe you. Are you really sure? Tell me, are you really sure? Well, I, I don't know... Nin, then something has to be done, right? - But are you so sorry? - No, what are you saying? A child you can't understand what it means to me. It seems to me that all of a sudden I've become a man like the others. Ninetta! What are you doing, are you shaking? Not out of fear now. We two don't count for anything anymore. Now He is in charge. Think about it. Nina, Nina! - Did you take the gun? - No, why? So who's got it? A ghost!? Are you sure you had it when you got home? Of course, I also took the bullet out of the barrel, here it is. Hurry up, don't waste my time. - What have you been up to? - Nothing. Nothing, I didn't do anything! Who's up there? Tell me, who's there? Dad, there's been a guy hiding in our house for a fortnight. Up in the attic. It's him who took the gun, I'm sure! Who? Ninetta, tell me! Dad, run away. Go away, I'm afraid for you! Otherwise he'll kill you, the Hunchback! Dad! Alvaro, don't shoot! I'm the one who coming forward. If you shoot, you'll only kill me. You promised me. You even swore to me. Leave him alone, he's my father! - Shame on you! - No, leave me! In my house, I'll kill you! I'll kill you, bitch! The baby! The baby, the baby! It wasn't my fault. He raped me, to get revenge on you. If he hasn't killed you yet, it's because he's in love with me. Everyone hates you, do you understand? And I pay for you. Don't make a scandal, you fool, it's not in your interest! Do what you want, but there should be nothing left of the Hunchback here, got it? Nothing! Better for you. And the Hunchback's hours are numbered, I don't even want the trouble of killing him. I want his own comrades to cut him to pieces. Let them kill each other. - What do you want to do? - I know what I'll do. Forget him! Forget him! Even if you kill him they'll make you pay the price. - Good morning, Marshal. - Good morning. Good morning. - No, don't worry, play. - Thank you. - I know you don't have the soldiers' obligations. Have I ever bothered you about this? Besides, I'm not on duty right now. Even marshals have free days, right? Ah, here you are, Arduino? I was looking for a favour. - Good morning, marshal. - Good morning. I have something for Cencio. - Marshal, whoever sees that son of mine. - Of course, you never see him. You don't even know where he is, huh? In case you see him... give him this. - What's this thing? - It belongs to Alvaro, the Hunchback. He's been to my house for a few days and left it there. And now go find the Hunchback! Maybe Cencio will see him again. And when they meet, he can give it back to him. They see each other. And if one hand switches to the other... Beware of the Hunchback The hunchback is a fascist Oh, you can't trust anyone. I've always said when one marked by God... Pellaccia, what is written here? Do you think it's a primer? It says what I read to you before. The Hunchback is a traitor Oh, damn them! Here I am. Well then? You must account to me for all this crap you've been saying about me and that you wrote on the walls! You know very well it's a slander. Because you can't stand me. Because I don't listen to you, you and all your bosses! Because I see shadows and I shoot, whoever gets it, gets it! Is this scarf yours? You left it at Moretti's house. Is Moretti a partisan too? I'll make you lick it clean. what you wrote against me. Come on! So watch out, huh? There nobody knows you. Go inside and ask for Marshal Moretti. Tell him it's urgent. When he arrives, just tell him: marshal, Ninetta sent me. And the Hunchback... You tell him the Hunchback, not Alvaro, - has entered your house. - All right. Then when you go out, just think of running away. - Understood? Go. - All right. Believe Obey Fight - Marshal, shall we come with you? - No, there's no need. Moretti! Help me, I need you. Not even a second longer do I want to stay like this. Especially out of charity. Fiorin, fiorello, beautiful is love near you It makes me dream, it makes me shake... Hey, did someone die? Better not think about it, I'll console you. Come on, hunchback! Listen to me, it's the only way to forget everything. I've been working around here for ten years. And I know some things. Come on, come with me! It makes me dream, it makes me... Hunchback, run away! Hey, did you hear? Stop for a while. Stop there! Hands up! Don't move. You're Alvaro Cosenza, called the Hunchback. You must decide to talk, understand? You have to tell us everything. But which Alvaro? Which Cosenza? Lies. I'm a poor wretch. Shall I tell you my misfortunes? What can I tell you? Needless to deny, we know. Talk, it will be better for you. It's the only hope you have. I told you everything. And then I don't talk to those I don't like. I have a surprise for you. I want to see if you still deny it. Comedy's over, huh? Alvaro Cosenza! Look who's here! Miss, here is your father's killer. I promised you we'd get him. Now just for formality's sake, tell us if it's him and we'll put him against the wall without a fuss. So do you recognize him? - No, it's not him. - What? What are you saying? It's him, I tell you. Let's not play games, miss. We know who he is, we are sure. - I've never seen him! - Does she take us for fools! We know him well. Do you know him better than I do? I had him face to face, that coward! He raped me, you know that? He even got me pregnant before killing my father like a dog! But I didn't want his baby, he'll never be born. What was I to do? Make him a scoundrel, a hunchback like his father? Bitch, what did that poor creature do to you? One thing. Being yours! I should have killed you, not your father! Nothing disgusts me anymore after being with you. Wretch, go away or you... - What'll you do to him? - We'll make him talk. Go, go! So what do you want to do? Talk? Can you tell us who the other bandits are with you? Yes, or not? They all have fake names. People I only know by sight. Fine, we'll take you to the borgata. You'll show them to us there. Then we understand each other. We follow at a distance of 20 meters. You go ahead and act like you're free. Let your friends approach you. If we get the bosses, you've every chance of saving yourself. But don't try to escape. Don't jest because there will be three of us shooting. Go! - Alvaro! - What are you saying? - Alvaro! - But he's back? Yes, he's there. Let's go meet him. Come on, come on. Cencio, Alvaro is back! - Are you kidding? - Come and see, come on! - Go away, pezze al culo!! - Why? There's someone following him. Look! Alvaro! Alvaro! Alvaro! - You bastard, you denounced me! - What are you doing, are you crazy? Watch out, Cencio! Watch out, Alvaro! Alvaro! Come on, be strong. It's nothing, Alvaro, let's run away, I can do it. Let's take him away. - Eh, why are you stopping? - Alvaro, pezze al culo is dead. Did he have any relatives we need to notify? June 4, 1944 Allied troops liberate Rome Come on we're here. Come on, dad, pull! Oh, be careful not to drop anything! Well, do you like it? it's this one. Tell me, are you sure it will be ours? Why not! Don't you think so, dad? Are you sure nobody's in there? And who'd be there? It's ours. That's how I paid for it. It cost me a hand. - Fringuello, bring the crowbar. - Sounds like a dream to me, eh! Do you see? There's also a small terrace to hang out the laundry. My mom's house... - Come in, come on! - Let's go, come on. Look at that harem! Ninetta! Ninetta! Stop! - Ninetta! - Help! Ninetta, listen, stop! - Stop! - Leave me! - Stop. - Go away! - Listen. - No! Help! Go away! No! No, leave me! - Let me go! - Shut up, damn it! Shut up! - No! - Don't run away! - Wait! - Go away! Look! I'll make you pay for this! Thanks. Woman, where are you going? Come, get in. - You a fascist? - Me? - Yes. - No. My father fascist, understand? Yes, if you speak slowly, clearly, I understand all things. My mother, my mother, from Salerno. - Salerno? - Yes, Salerno. Why is your father a fascist? I don't know. And where is he now? - He's dead. - He's dead? How did he die? They killed him. That one with the hump, he killed him. - The hunchback, do you understand? - Killed, why, why? Because the partisans killed the fascists. And the fascists killed the partisans. Why him? - Why did he beat me? - Yes. How do I explain it to you? Because he's a bastard who ruined my life and my father's life and he won't let me be. Is he your fiance, boyfriend? Nope. Cigarette? - I've never smoked. - Come on! - I'll try! Then go, be quick. I'll wait for you here. Come with me, I'm scared to go alone. - Fear, understand? - Why? It's your house! - Why are you afraid? - Why, why? You always say why! How can I explain there are displaced people and that my stuff is still inside. Come on, come, come! Hey, what do you want? I came for my stuff. Go away, it's better for you. I don't even want to hear you talk! Now I'll fix you! Alberto! Alberto, come here, come on! She got herself a knight! But do you know who she is? She was the daughter of a fascist, she was a friend of the Germans. Of the comrades! - Give it to me! - Hands off! - What's going on? - Leandro! Once I was Leandro! and now I'm the one-armed one. And do you know whose fault? Your father's! Your father, do you understand? Her father made me like this! Do you want the dress back? Get the American to pay for it. You're bastards! Clear off, scram! Now the traitors can to go and live in the caves! The famine is over for us! Today it's our turn to live good! You try to go and steal! You go walk the streets! - But why? - Do you want to know why I cry? You don't understand why? No, I know that. I know why you're crying. They took your house. Those people have lost their homes under the bombs. Got it? Bombing! Yes, the bombings brought down homes. But they've never had a home They've lived in huts up till now. They're scum! Look what they reduced it to! Please, no! I don't understand anything. I don't... I don't understand anything! Peter! Peter! Wait! Peter... - Good night, George. - Bye, now. Do you still think you scare me? No, nothing scares me anymore. Did you come to kill me? Then kill me, but hurry up. You've done everything but kill a woman. May I know what you are looking for here? You can only be here for two reasons. Either to kill me, or to make love. Hurry up and choose. You don't have to pay anything to kill me. I'm Moretti's daughter and am friendly with the Americans. Imagine that. If you want to make love, you have to pay first. Ninetta... Cut it out. Don't say that. If you need money... I'll give it to you. But stop leading this life. I get it. You feel guilty because you know it's all your fault. Look, look! Here look, I have all the money that I want now. I also have to thank you. It's thanks to you that I started this beautiful career. It's tough work, I'm not saying it isn't, but you also earn plenty. My father never saw so much money in his life. Take it, I don't want presents from anyone. In fact, now I'm the one making money. I need a protector to defend me. Do you have one on hand by any chance? So what am I to do? Shall I get dressed, or can I continue undressing? Take off your clothes. Go away! Go away, hurry up! I can't, with you even if you cover me with gold. I'm sorry. The Head of the Allies Military Government of Rome orders the delivery of civilian weapons to be carried to the barracks of the allies or the nearest Carabinieri Command. The deadline expires on 25-6-1944 at 24:00, after this date whoever has weapons will be punished by the laws of the allied military code. What's it that you want? Why are you still armed? We have come because we want to continue fighting with you against the Germans. But we can't leave the guns in civilian hands. We have to ensure order in the liberated areas. You are not a regular army. We fought faithfully for your same ideals. We fought in accordance with your commands. Someone could use your own weapons to fight against the law and commit violence. Then we're against the law, are we? Lay down your arms, I'll give you three minutes or I'll take them away! - Deposit your weapons! - Wait! - Guys, we must obey. - I'll shoot the first one that gets close. But you can't shoot those who freed us! They fight against the Germans. They aren't our enemies! - But why are they so suspicious? - It's not their fault! For three years the Italians shot them in the face. They don't trust us because they can't imagine what happened here. With what we've been through! There's nothing you can do, guys. What we went through we did it like this, for fun. And this is how they pay us? Thank you so much, huh? After all, my homeland is my belly, that's what my homeland is! The suburbs are a storehouse of weapons. Until now we hoped they'd turn them in, but we must make a house to house search. Hunchback! Hunchback! The Hunchback kills an MP who attempts to disarm him. Allied truck attacked by the Hunchback Two traders killed during an ambush. Two traders killed during an ambush Hey, hands up! Stop! Against the wall! Don't kill me. Alvaro, the stuff here is all yours I have two chests full of gold. I'll make you the richest man in the world. I'll give you everything. Alvaro, don't kill me! Save me, Alvaro, save me! What bastards! You steal to do your own business and the papers say it was the Hunchback. It was the Neapolitan, he who fired the gun and brought us here. I know the Neapolitan and I know all of you too. Now you understand what awaits you when you set foot outside your home! Going unpunished where I'm in charge. Go! This is my area! And if anyone interferes here, they're done for! If you still black market behind my back, I'll kill you all! Get out! Get out! BLOOD ON THE STREETS 2 Carabinieri killed by bandits The Hunchback gang attacks Firefight between Carabinieri and bandits Allied Depot Looted by Hunchback's Men A ring of fire around Rome Unspoilt potatoes without card, without boxes! Where does the Hunchback's family live, please? There. - Here are the lemons. - No, not that! Let's go! Is anyone there? Where does Alvaro live? Here or there? Do you know Alvaro? The one with the humpback. You like chocolate, huh? If you tell me where Alvaro lives, I'll give it to you. There is nobody there. Do you know where they went? is it good? - You just don't know where they've gone? - Far away. And they never come back here even in the night? Nope. - But Alvaro, do you know Alvaro? - Yes. Does he ever come here? - How long since you've seen him? - Never. You never see him, or do you sometimes? - Yes? - And where? Here? - No in the night. - Mari! - Oh, Mari, come here! - Bye. - Cencio, are they playing with the kids? - You'll notice what kids! Damn, a month you've messed me around and then you put me in a straitjacket? - Maybe you're kidding me? - No, Mr. Alvaro. - Hello, Alvaro. - See who it is, Cencio! - Have you stopped being a truck driver? - No. With this jacket you'll give me two humps, eh? Go away, go! Cencio, every time I see you, I hope you've changed your mind and decided to come with me. I want cigarette pants, I told you! No, I just came for the tyre. Only you have them and I must work. - I have bills. - Choose what you want. - You know, if I don't pay them... - Take what you want. How much are you asking? Take four, I'll give them to you. No, I can't take either one or four as a gift. - Why not? - Because it's stolen stuff. But Rome is full of stolen stuff, do you want me to distinguish? I'll give you a down payment just because they're nowhere to be found. But what down payment? Come on, take it and take it home. You speak like a printed book. Believe in beautiful speeches, words, everything the parties tell, the CLN, but when will you convince yourself that talking won't solve anything? Don't kid yourself, come on, look around. You can say what you want but... you are a bandit. Aren't those who want to change the world called bandits? But you don't change anything, you just mind your own business. And you, with your pickup truck, what do you think you're doing? I want to tell you something, Cencio. It's preachers like you that screw everything up. Stop it, Alvaro, and enjoy life before they put you in jail or kill you. Leandro! Leandro! What do you want? My brother isn't here. - Is your mother there? - What is it? - Go away! - Are 100,000 lire any good to you? Do you see them? If you give me back the house, I'll give you all the money, here it is. No, dear, I'm too well settled inside this house. Only after I die will they move me from here. Maybe I'll eat bread and onion, but I want to stay here. Here, I'll put in another 20,000 lire. After all, I'm getting my stuff back. Wasn't the house mine? These 120 bundles I'm giving you are all for you. It's my house by right, the only thing my father left me. You have to give it back to me! Now there's no more fascism, the tables have turned. Well, what's going on? And you, what are you doing here? Who brought you? Oh, poor lovebird, she wants her home back. She thinks we hate living in an apartment. We lived in a shack for 20 years. And now for 100,000 lire... but get that out of your head! Hey, where are you going? Listen. I haven't talked to you yet, you know? How much will you give me? - 100 thousand lire? - 120 I'll give you. That's fine with me. But I also want one more thing. What do you want? - Ninetta. - Me? Do you want your home back? You see how beautiful it is! So, what are you doing? Examining your conscience? I'm on it. I'm fine with that too. Get out, get out of the house, We're leaving in an hour. Wretch, this house has cost us tears of blood! - And now this hooker... - Shut up! You'll realise what you're doing! You're ruining the whole family! - Filthy scoundrel... - So? - Where are we going? - I know. Here everywhere's full of kids. Come on. That's enough. Wait outside. Come on, behave yourselves. Sister, sister! The hunchback is back! Calm down, calm down sister, do it for the children. Whatever he says don't contradict him! He's a bloodthirsty killer. I told you not to accept anything from him. But he forced us, threatened us with a machine gun. - And then for the children! - We'll call the Carabinieri. Good morning, guys. - Praised be Jesus Christ, sister. Always be praised. We already begged you once not to come here again. Children, stand up. There's a guest. - Sister, I put my feet where I want. - Alvaro, listen. We have suffered your violence, but your charity is sinful. You know us, you were here as a kid. We want to do good only with our own strength. Sister, here in the borgata I make day and night, and also in church. You should think about making good soup for the kids. Otherwise, you'll be in trouble. Come on, make me some room, little girl. - Will you give me the spoon? - No! You'll give it to me? This soup is good. - You really know how to make it. - Did you see, Alvaro? - Now, Alvaro, try to... - Is there a plate for me too? Sister, bring him a bowl of soup, hurry! But don't eat it all, let that little girl eat in peace. Alvaro, Alvaro! There's a Carabiniere! - Hey, here he is, he's coming! - The Carabinieri! Blessed be Jesus, there are children here, please! Marshal, for heaven's sake! Don't worry, sister, children are dear to me too. I've been looking for you to talk to you. Sister, are you waiting for the soup to get cold? So you've come to make an armistice? Has Italy surrendered? Look, it's been a week since I've been transferred here. This is my first important visit. Sit down. I speak the same, if I eat. Better yet. Take a seat. Sister, let's take the children away. The war ended here in Rome and also the uproar that occurred. We need to think about getting this poor Italy back on its feet. You understand, we've already had so many misfortunes, so much suffering. The authorities have decided to restore order to the city. At any cost. Ah, sorry, I forgot. - Would you like some, Marshal? - No, thanks, I've already eaten. They've known you since you were little, huh? - Yes, but then I grew up. - A little too much. - What do you mean? - That you have committed many crimes, but you still have time to save yourself, if you want. You're young, believe me, there will be amnesties. Amnesties are good for common offenders, but not for me. I don't think we understand each other. And if I was you, I'd get out of here. Leave us alone. But you are a common offender, don't kid yourself. Today maybe you're stronger than me and the law. But it won't last long. I spoke to you man to man. If you won't listen to me, too bad for you. - You don't scare me. - Neither do you. Let's go outside and continue this conversation. Come on, let's go, children. Hurry up, silence! Go away, go away! Come on, go away, quick! Come on! Guys, the marshal here says he's not afraid of anything. Go, put him against the wall! Come on, Marshal, you have one minute to shout: long live the Hunchback! Come on, hurry up, if you care about your skin. I'm sorry, but I can't. Ah, you can't, huh? Would you rather get your skin pierced as a matter of principle? I can't, Alvaro. I have a wife and children and they are in your hands. But I'm a military man. And I can't do what you say. Come on, give him the gun back. Go away, Marshal! Don't you and your friends dare set foot in these parts again! Do you understand? Run, run, Rich?, a mad dog! If you're looking for Monco he doesn't live here anymore. I already know. - It was you I was looking for. - Here we go again? Alvaro, what are you still looking for here? I told you, I need a protector. One who may exploit me, but protect me. The streets are full of killers. Why stand there, saying nothing? You're just like a mummy. You were looking for me? You wanted to talk to me. You make me mad! And like a fool I'm wasting time with you. - Coming here, I saw a rabid dog. - Are you okay? Yes, over there. But they took him. He ran desperately. I don't known whether out of fear, or out of anger, blindly. Everyone ran away as if they'd gone crazy. And then when they caught him, everyone threw stones at him, kicked him, spat at him. Don't you know that all little boys are mean to animals? If I had a son, you know the beatings he'd get! You mean you feel like a rabid dog? And where do you want to bite me? Choose. But careful, I'm full of poison. Full of poison, understand? To the bone. I'm rotten from head to toe. And I don't care. I know by now, I won the war. You lost it. Whatever you do, you've lost it. I came to ask you a favor. Are you asking me for money? How I'd like to give you some of my money. No, Ninetta, not that. Now that you've got your house back, you can change job too. No, not out of jealousy. But because it hurts me. This is a job that you can't change. Well, I've got water heating up. I have to go take a bath. Outside we must be clean and perfumed, bye. And if you feel like a mad dog, don't show up again. I like men who are bastards, but cheerful. And that laugh at every silly thing! Wretch! Damn disgusting bitch! You've finished living this life, you and all your companions! Oh, has the Hunchback gone mad? Why is he loading all the hookers onto trucks? Are you looking for the lost sheep? He's gone mad, it looks like a bust by the vice squad. If he's taking them all away, he'll leave none for us. Now this! , run! If they take Nella from you, you're done eating! Come on, walk! Come on, get inside! - Nella, you moron, where are you going? - Leandro, help, they're taking me away! Leandro, they're taking me away! Throw yourself down, you wretch! Shut up, listen. I'm glad you know me, that you know who I am, so we understand each other immediately and can get this straight. So listen up. Here you go. I have something very important to tell you. From tonight we must put an end to this infamy of prostitution! Shut up, stop it! Shut up! Shut up! Silence! If you need money, here it is, look! Look! Take it, take it, I'll give you as much as you want! What is the Hunchback doing, is he crazy? Here you go, take it, take it! Again! Bread for kids, money for these wretches, what's the point if you have blood on your hands. The Marshal was right. Take it, take it! Take the bag too! Leandro! Leandro! How much is there? 3,000 lire? Come on, come on. Monco! You can clear off, Nella stays here! You stay here! She's my girlfriend and she comes with me! No, she won't move from here! They're done walking the streets! Alvaro, I don't want it to end badly with you. - Each for himself and God for all. - Nella, go back with the others Stay where you are! Who are you? Who do you think you are? She's my woman and she has to do what I say. Not what you say! Do we understood each other once and for all? What's on your mind? Your days are numbered and right now you're showing some determination. Don't be nice to me! You're making a scene for Ninetta's sake, to look good in front of her! Leave Ninetta alone. And why? Ninetta is as good as all these wretches that you are deluding and maybe even worse. You must send her to the hospice! Alvaro, forget him, listen to me. Stop that, or we'll leave too. Alvaro, he was one of ours. You don't need to defend me. He started playing the redeemer, but out of jealousy! Murderer, murderer! Alvaro Cosenza, you are surrounded! Surrender! Alvaro Cosenza, you are surrounded! Give yourself up! - In the name of the law! - Stop! You stay here, where are you going? Stay here, Ninetta. They won't do anything to you. Stay here. No, I'm going with you. I don't want to be alone, I'm scared. Wait for me. What are you waiting for, Alvaro, run for it! Hands up! Hands up! Drop your weapons! Run, Alvaro! He won't get very far. The area is completely surrounded. Let's start the round-ups. And mind you, the order is to shoot on sight. Let's go. I shouldn't have taken you with me, go back to your house, go! This time I want to, Alvaro. I should hate you and instead it seems to me that I have only you in the world. I have nothing but you, Alvaro! Ninetta, I hurt you so much. Forgive me, I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time. This gives me courage. Now I would like to live. I'd like to do so much for you. But I'm sorry, I'm afraid it's too late. Don't say that, it's not too late. We both have to live. We've both been unlucky up till now. Let's go away, Alvaro, away from here. We've just been trash, you understand? Trash to everyone. Don't cry, don't cry, Nin. You know I can't bear to see you cry. We can still save ourselves. I've a friend who lives behind the Tiber. He has a car. We could go as far as Naples. - And get a boat, okay? - Yes. Yes, let's get away. Look, Alvaro, I have a lot of money hidden at home. - I'll go get it. - Ninetta, stop, you're crazy! There's no time. - The money, you understand? With money you can do anything. We can go where nobody knows you. Where we'll be treated like decent people, not like rabid dogs. Listen, then take the safest path of the marana. Don't be afraid, I'm too smart by now. - Wait for me. - But not here. At the vineyard by the river. Ninetta! What do you want? Here she is! Let's not lose sight of her. Ninetta! I have the money, let's get away. - Soon it'll be morning. - Isn't it dangerous? No, it's not far. Come on. Alvaro, Alvaro, don't shoot! Please, Alvaro, they can't shoot at me! Alvaro, Alvaro, don't shoot! Alvaro! No! No! Don't shoot! Alvaro, no! - No! - Let go of me! Don't shoot! Stop, don't shoot! Don't shoot! - Leave me alone! - No - Go away! - No! Ninetta! Ninetta! Damn you all! It was March of 1945 In the North, the war was not yet over Subtitles written by Claudia, I hope you enjoyed them
