It's Christmas again. (soft music) - [Shivaani] Kabir? - What's the point in knocking? You don't have to do all this. - You shouldn't eat all this stuff. - I like this stuff. - Why didn't you eat the food that I brought for you? I brought you fresh food. Because you don't like it? - I never said that. (water running) Shivaani, I said don't do that. - You can't live like this. - Like what? - Like this. - I said I'll get to it. Just let it go. - [Shivaani] You know your mother would have never-- - Shivaani. - She wouldn't. - Come help us. - I think you both have this under control. - He prefers to supervise. - Except when it's time to eat. You used these dishes. Help wash them. - Uh huh. - Okay I'm coming. It's just that I am stuck in this dimensional time warp that slows down time. - Smart ass. - I am almost there. - Why don't you practice the song you're gonna sing tonight? - But Kabir is stuck in a time warp. - Yes, so he has to watch without criticizing. - [Mom] Oh, you're right. - I can still hear you guys. ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Although my heart is aching ¶ - Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Stop, stop. Come on, you're not gonna really sing like that tonight? Are you please? - She's teasing you. - I will if you're stuck in a dimensional time whatever. - No, seriously don't do that. Please. - Seriously come on. - All right, what do you want? I said don't do that. - Are you going into the city? - Yes, I am. - And? - And what? - What are you gonna tell them? - What we discussed. - So you're going back? - Yes, I said yes, Shivaani. - What time is your appointment? - God, Shivaani. What do you want? - Seriously what do I want? - You know what I mean. - No, I don't know what you mean, Kabir. - Well then just let it go. - Look, we all loved your mother. - Shivaani, please. - You've got-- - Got to what? - [Shivaani] Nothing. - No, tell me what I need to do. I'm already going back to med school. What more do you want me to do? - How about living together? How about being normal? - Shivaani, you're the one who told me to move here. - I didn't know that you were gonna live in your mother's house forever. - It's only been a year. - It's a long time, Kabir. I seriously think you should start thinking about selling this house. - Shivaani, don't you dare tell me to sell this house again. - Don't I dare? - Yeah okay 'cause I'm done talking about that. - [Shivaani] Where are you going? - [Kabir] I need some space. - Look, come to the party tomorrow. - I don't want to. - If not for my sake, then come for my parents. - What does this have to do with your parents? - If you don't come, then everybody's gonna ask them where you are. It'll put them in a spot. It's not fair to them, Kabir. Try to come. Come say hi to everybody. Okay? I'll see you later. (cell phone ringing) - Hey, how's it going? - [Catherine] Are you gonna come by? - I told you I have that party tonight. - You're gonna be at the hospital today right? - Yeah, I'm gonna be at the hospital. - So, come by after. - Catherine, listen. - Only for a sec. I wanna give you your Christmas present before I leave town. - Okay all right. Only for a second. - Awesome. Text me when you're coming. - Yeah okay. All right. (soft music) - Hey KB. - [Kabir] Hey Paddy. - Oh, give me that. This Shivaani's cooking? - Yup. - How come you just give this stuff away? How you doing, man? - Okay. Paddy, that's disgusting. - No, it's delicious. - No, how could you eat like that? - Like this. Wanna try one? Here try. Try some. - Oh no way. - My fingers are clean. You can try one. - Paddy, I know for a fact your fingers are filthy. - What? - [Kabir] You don't wash your hands. - Of course I do. State law requires me to. - Paddy, I've seen you come of that bathroom without washing your hands okay. - You get some alcohol on your fingers, you don't have to wash it off. Why are you so squeamish anyway? - Med school. You don't wanna know the things that I know. - Ignorance is bliss, my friend. Believe me. - What? - You're all dressed up and looking nice. - So? - Well, I just haven't seen you look like. - Like what? - Look like you for a long time. What's the occasion? - I've got that meeting at school. - Oh, you think they'll let you back? - What does that even mean? - I don't know. Maybe they filled their quota on good looking doctors. You saw Shivaani. Any improvement? - [Kabir] In what? - Getting back together. - No. Not happening. - Seriously? Do I have to tell you what it means when a woman brings you food? - Yeah, tell me what it means. - It means she loves you. - Maybe she's doing what she thinks a wife would do. - No, she's doing it because she wants to get back together with you. - Okay Paddy, let's drop it. - Okay. All right. Hey, you coming to the party? - No. - No? - [Kabir] No. - [Paddy] Why not? - Paddy, what were we just talking about? - About Shivaani. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Just cheer up, man. It's Christmas okay. - I don't care if it's Christmas. - That was your mother's favorite holiday. - What do you know about my mother? - Are you serious? - Yeah you think Christmas was her favorite holiday. - Yeah, I know it was. - Well you don't know anything. - Hey, hey, chill out, man. - [Kabir] You chill out, Paddy. Fuck off.

You just left after your third semester. Do you think you're ready to come back? Mister Bakshi? - Sorry what? - [Administrator] I understand it was your mother who departed. - [Man] Your mother. - What about her? - [Man] She collapsed. - [Administrator] Mister Bakshi? - What if I'm not ready yet? - Well, we usually don't allow students to be gone longer than a year, even for bereavement. We have to consider the impact such a long absence would have on your studies. This curriculum is designed-- - Couldn't I apply for a longer leave of absence? - There's a lot of paperwork you'd have to submit and there's no guarantee it'd be granted. - When would I have to make that request? - I don't think that's such a good idea. Sometimes it's-- - Ma'am, when would I have to apply for the request? - As soon as possible. Right after the holidays. - Hey, Bodhisattva. Huh? - Sorry what did you call me? - Can you help me ease my suffering? - [Kabir] Hey. Don't click somebody's picture without asking. - Or without paying, huh. - I'm sorry. Asking would've ruined the moment. - Yeah, you mean it would've ruined your shot? - Yeah, I-- - No, you don't do that. Okay? (soft music) - Ow. - Watch where the fuck you're going. - Hey fuck you. - Fuck you. - [Mom] Kabir. - Ouch. Ow Mom, what the hell? - This is Christmas. - (laughs) Look who's returned. - Hey listen. Did you see where she went? - Who? - The girl, the photographer. - Who? - [Kabir] Where is she? - She went that way. - That way? Hey. Hey, hey, hey. - Hey. - Listen. I wanted to apologize about earlier. - It's okay. I think it was my fault. - Oh no, no. It was my fault. It's Christmas and I should be nicer to people, especially to people visiting. I assume you're not from here. - I'm from Kenya. - Oh Kenya. Hey, you followed me here? - I had my picture taken, too. A lady's gotta eat, huh. - Here. - Thank you. - You got your money. You can go now. Thank you. - Hold on. There is something special between you two. No, no. Really. Just take a moment and look at each other. - We can go. - No really. Just take a moment and really look at her. Just look at her for a moment. You too, miss. Take a moment and really look at him. - Okay come here. - No, no, this is silly. - Come on, just take a moment. (soft music) - [Homeless Woman] That's it. - Okay anyways, this is enough. - What about you, miss? Do you believe in karma? - I do. - Come this way. Just come on, come on. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Come, come. - Merry Christmas you two. - Well, it was nice meeting you and I suppose she won't follow us around anymore. - She's a strange woman. - She's a crazy woman. - But I think she means well. - I think it's better you stay away from people like that because the city can be pretty dangerous sometimes. - [Kioni] What's your name? - My name is Kabir. - [Kioni] Kabir. - Well, my friends call me KB sometimes. - Which do you like? - Whatever. - I like Kabir. Is it Indian? - Yes it is. And what's your name? - Kioni. - Kioni? You're on vacation? - Kind of. - Kind of? - I applied to film school here. I just finished my interview. - And how'd that go? - [Kioni] Pretty good I guess. - Yeah, I guess you never really know about those things. So Kioni, do you know where you're going? - I wanna see more of the city. I wanna see the Christmas decorations. - Okay, so you should take the train uptown because there's a lot of beautiful Christmas decorations up there, but you don't wanna go that way 'cause you might bump into the homeless lady again. If you want, I can show you another subway entrance. - Can I walk? - From here? - [Kioni] Yeah. - No, that's too far. Listen. Since you're a visitor here, if you want, I can show you a few interesting places. - That'd be nice. Thank you. (gentle music) (camera shutter clicking) - Whoa, you really like all these buildings. - Never seen anything like them. - Never? - I mean we have tall buildings in Kenya, but the architecture's different. Not where they're altogether like this. (camera shutter clicking) - But you keep taking pictures of all of them. - I know it's silly. (gentle music) - Well I've never really thought about the buildings. I mean, there are famous ones in New York like the Empire State Building, the Flatiron Building, the Chrysler Building, so many, but it's not like I thought about the buildings. - [Kioni] Why not? - [Kabir] They're just buildings. - You see a building. I see a story. - [Kabir] You see a story? - Sure. Each one has a story. - That reminds me of my first year in medical school. - You're a doctor? - A med student. During my first year in medical school, I lived in the student housing in a building on Park Avenue. - Nice. - No, not nice. Not nice. It was an old rundown building that must have been housing medical students for like 200 years or something, but what you just said made me realize that all the students who ever lived there must have had stories and conversations and revelations about their time there. - And all the people made friends then fell in love. - And lost their minds in their studies, but no one would ever know walking by unless they were a part of that story. To everyone else it'd just be another building. - Or another story. ¶ Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro" ¶ Show me the pictures you took of me. Show me, show me, show me, show me, show me, show me. - Okay, look, look. - Thank you so much. - I'm married. - Ummm, Okay. - Sorry, I don't know why I said that. I don't know why I said that. Forget it. - It's okay. I'm not trying to come on to you. - No, no, I know, I know. That's why I don't know why I said that. I-- I didn't mean to make it all awkward. Listen. - Really it's okay. - Listen, ummm... Okay, the thing is my wife and I recently separated and haven't been living together for some time. So, I just. - Hey we're just hanging out. Okay? You don't have to explain anything to me. - Okay. - You're kind of a dork you know. - A dork? - Total dork. - Why? What? - A girl kisses you on the cheek and you get all flustered and blush. - That's not fair okay. You surprised me. - Sure, sure. - You wanna sit here? Do people give gifts in Kenya on Christmas? - Some people do but the focus is also on community and celebrating the birth of Jesus, which the churches do. My family had a tradition of eating cake. - You know, my family is not Christian, so for us Christmas was never about the birth of Jesus. - Are you Muslim? - No, not Muslim. Not really anything. I mean, my parents were Hindus, but at home we never really spoke about it. - So what do you do on Christmas? - I never really liked Christmas. - You don't like Christmas? - You know if it was more about religion than about gift giving maybe I would but-- - [Kioni] But? - My mom raised me alone. My dad died when I was very young and we never really had much money and so I never really liked Christmas. I would hate that after the holidays when all the kids came back to school, they'd show off all the amazing gifts that they got from Santa Claus, and I'd just tried to hide the fact that the most amazing gifts I got from Santa were new underwear and socks. - Those are good gifts. - Well, I see that now. You know, that my mom was being practical and only got me things that I needed, but you know as a kid, it hurts when you realize that you got all the things you got because you're poor. Everything during Christmas revolves around how much money you have. The more you have, the better it is. - That's true about everything though, isn't it? - Yeah, but for kids it's not. They don't know any of that. As a child I could have a stick and call it a sword. You know? I could have a cardboard box and it'd be my castle and I'd be the kind and I'd be happy. - So why is Christmas any different? - It's different because one day you realize that Santa Claus is actually your mom and what you get has nothing to do with how good or bad you are, but about how much money you had, and that's when all the realities of life hit me. - You realized this as a kid? - I was 10 years old and my dad had been gone for sometime and that particular year my mom got a fake plastic Christmas tree instead of the real one and I remember when that happened, I was so angry. I was so upset, I cried and I yelled at her. I mean, that moment ruined Christmas for me. - Why? - Because I knew we got a fake plastic Christmas tree because we couldn't afford the real one and all the illusions of Christmas came - I think we can all relate to feeling like money's a problem, but you look like you're doing pretty good now. - Don't judge a book by it's cover. - Let's get something to eat. I'm hungry. I wanna try New York pizza. - You haven't had New York pizza? - No. - Oh okay, let's go. Pizza? - [Kioni] Yes. - [Kabir] You have to try it. New York pizza is the best. - That was really good. - Told you. - The first Christmas movie I remember seeing was the "Miracle on 34th Street". The color version, not the black and white one. - I saw the black and white one. It's about that old man who plays Santa in the department store and pretends to be the real Santa Claus. Wasn't there something about a house? - Yeah. The little girl wants her dream house for her family to live in and by the end, they get it and it's a miracle. - Yeah. I sort of remember that. - It had a huge impact on me. I was orphaned really young and I-- - You're an orphan? - Yeah, my parents died when I was eight but I wasn't-- - I'm so sorry to hear that. I feel like such an asshole. I've been talking about being poor and about all my problems. So sorry. - No, don't worry about it. I realized long ago that my life is my journey and it's just as amazing and difficult as anyone else that's on the planet. - [Kabir] When did you realize that? - It's kind of connected to that movie. To all Christmas movies. Those movies were fantasy. Like the idea that you could ask for whatever you wanted and just get it, that's amazing, and I totally fell for it. I didn't really understand who Santa was until after my parents died, and so my first Christmas without them, my first in the orphanage, I used to write letters to Santa and I'd wish for a house and a family and I'd cry when it didn't happen. - How can you still like Christmas? I'd hate it if I were you. - All those hopes and wishes and unanswered letters to Santa revealed to me what I want in life. The dreams of a child are basic, but they're the backbone of who we are when we grow up. - But what if you don't get any of those things? - I already have those things. We have everything we want all our lives. We just have to change our perspective. I wanted a family growing up and I had one. The kids I grew up with. The women who raised me. The lady from my church who helped me get here. They're my family. And I've always had a place to live and food in my belly. I may not have my mom and dad anymore, but I have them. I'm blessed. - And you're willing to leave all that and come to America? You wouldn't want to stay back and help the kids in the orphanage? - But I will. Coming here and continuing my education is the best thing I can do to help my people. Once I'm done with school, I can go back and help other people tell their stories and while I'm here, I can meet people like you and tell them about Kenya. - Kioni, I must say you're a very brave girl. - If I was brave, I would've gone ice skating. - No, I said brave not crazy. - [Catherine] KB? - What time is it? - It's ten after eight. - Oh no listen... I'm late. I was supposed to be home by nine to sing with my mom. She's gonna be upset. - Nine? You've plenty of time. Just stay a couple more minutes. - No listen, listen. I can't. I can't miss this. - Well. At least open your gift before you go. Here. - Wow, it's beautiful. - That is just the wrapping, knucklehead. Open it. - I don't know why I'm feeling so nervous. - What are you nervous about? - How about I open this when you get back? - No. No, open it now. Come on. - But I feel bad. I didn't get you anything. - Well it doesn't matter. Open mine. - Catherine, listen, how about we both open our gifts together when we see each other next? - KB, you are killing me. - Listen. I wanna do this right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Look at me. When you're back from the holidays, let's - Do what for real? - Be together. You and me. - And what about your wife? - No wife. - No wife? - I think it's time I called it quits. - You mean leave her? - Is that okay with you? - Seriously? Are you sure you don't wanna...? - I want this. I wanna be with you. Okay? - Yeah. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Hi, I'm Catherine. - Hello, I'm Kioni. - So how have you been? I haven't seen you since-- - Yeah, I've been all right. - Did you leave school? - No, I've been on leave. You know the bereavement. My mother. - Your mother, yeah. - How've you been? - Good. I graduate next semester. We've all been going crazy trying to get placed. Are you a med student? - No, I've applied to film school. - Oh, that's great. I tried to call you like a million times. I was just wondering. I mean, I just was hoping that you were okay. - Yeah, I've been okay. - That's good. That's great. That's great. And Shivaani, she's okay? - Shivaani's great. Shivaani's been good, yeah. - Well, it was so good to see you. - It was good to see you, too. - I'm getting married. I don't know why I just said that. I guess I just wanted you to know. - I'm happy for you, Catherine. Congratulations. - Thanks. Okay. So, Merry Christmas. - To you, too. - Merry Christmas. (gentle music) You've been pretty quiet since we ran into Catherine. Everything okay? - No, it's just this night. I mean, not this night, but this night last year when my mother died. - Yeah? - I was going to leave my wife. - To be with that woman? Catherine? - Yeah. - But then your mom died. - Yeah. - What happened? (soft music) - Kabir, where you been? - What are you talking about? It's only nine. - Your mother. - What about her? - [Man] She collapsed. They think it was a heart attack. - She had a heart attack. - [Kioni] I'm so sorry. - My wife's family has this annual Christmas party and my mother and I were supposed to sing. - Sing? Like karaoke? - No, this song. But I was with Catherine at her house while my mother... You know, I think I killed her. I think that killed her, you know. Sounds ridiculous, right? - No, it doesn't. (gentle music) [Kioni] For a long time I thought I'd killed my parents. - Why? What happened to them? - Car accident. (gentle music) - [Kabir] How could you think that was your fault? - I don't know. It's what people think. Maybe if I'd done this or done that, they'd still be alive. That's not true. It's beyond our control. The question you've got to answer is what's next? How do I go on without this person? - Easier said than done. - Why were you with Catherine that night instead of your family? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. (gentle music) - [Kabir] Making me follow traditions from India when I was raised in America is like having a split personality. It drove me crazy until I finally said enough is enough. - [Kioni] You mean by being with Catherine? - [Kabir] Yeah. - [Kioni] But when I kissed your cheek, you told me you're married. - [Kabir] I don't know why I said that. - [Kioni] Because in your heart, you're married. - [Kabir] Yeah, maybe. (gentle music) - [Kioni] What was the song? - [Kabir] The song? - [Kioni] The song that you were gonna sing with your mom? - [Kabir] You wouldn't know it. My mom picked it. - [Kioni] Oh, let's go there. Can you sing it? - [Kabir] Now? - [Kioni] Yeah, come on. - [Kabir] No, it's too cold. - Don't be a dork. - [Kabir] I can really sing. - [Kioni] Hold on. Let me take a picture. Sure you can. - [Kabir] I can. - [Kioni] Then let's hear it. - [Kabir] No, I've got a better idea. - [Kioni] What's that? - [Kabir] Dyker Heights. - [Kioni] What? - [Kabir] Oh you're going to love this place. (gentle music) - [Kioni] This place is amazing. - Yup, it's American Christmas on steroids. - I knew people put up decorations, but this is unreal. - Like a fairytale? My mother used to love this place. She'd come every year. - You don't like it? - I don't know. It's just another way for some rich people to show how rich they are. - But you could also say it's pretty magical, right? - That's what my mother used to say. "It's so magical." Anyways. (gentle music) How did the people of Kenya react to 9/11? I heard the response around the world was very... mixed. - I think most people mourned. I was pretty young but I remember seeing the images and they stayed with me. It was the first time I'd ever really thought about the United States and the first time I ever saw New York. All those tall buildings and I remember thinking, who would wanna destroy something like that? It was very confusing for me. (camera beeping) - [Kabir] What's the matter? - My memory card is full. - Did you take that many pictures? - [Kioni] I guess so. - [Kabir] What is that like a thousand? - I don't know. I'll have to buy another one. - All right, I'll give you one. I have some at home. - You're a photographer? - My mom was fond of photography. Are people racist in Kenya? - People are racist everywhere, I think. - I know but after 9/11, it got worse. - Worse? - Yeah, I mean you know when I was growing up, there were always these jerks who were making fun of me because of my skin color. You know, brown. Whatever. But after 9/11, it seemed like I was the terrorist and that was really confusing to me because I had no idea why they were saying such mean things to me. - Do you resent white people? - Do I resent white people? - Yeah. I can see how some people, especially in this country, could resent them. - No, I mean, I get what you're saying, but... If my friend Paddy doesn't resent white people, then I see no reason why I can. - Who's Paddy? - Paddy's like an uncle to me. He gave my mother a job as a bookkeeper after my father died. So he's pretty much had a hand in supporting us and taking care of us. - Is he Indian? - No, Paddy's African American. He was born during the Civil Rights movement, too. He's much older than me. But he's seen a lot of crazy stuff. - Racist stuff? - Yeah but you know even with all of that, he's remained such a positive person his whole life. If I had to pick, I'd say Paddy's the kindest person that I know. - What? - I don't know. I was a real asshole to him today. - To Paddy? What happened? - I actually don't know what happened. I just bit his head off for no reason. - But if he's kind as you say, he's probably already forgiven you. - Yeah, maybe. - But you should tell him though. - That I'm sorry? - That you're a jerk. Click. You have some nice Christmas decorations. - They're my mom's. - So they've been out for...? - Since she passed, yeah. - Can we turn them on? - The lights on the tree? - Yeah, come on. Come on. (gentle music) How do we turn them on? These are really nice decorations. - Yeah, my mom used to make ornaments. Like this one. - That's really nice. - People used to gift her ornaments all the time because they knew how much she loved Christmas. Like this one. This one's from Paddy. It's been a wonderful day today. - It has been really nice. (gentle music) [Kioni] What was her name? - My mom's? - Yeah. - Aasha. Aasha means "hope" in Hindi. - Aasha. That's a pretty name. Merry Christmas, Aasha. - Merry Christmas, mom. - Kabir? (Door slams) - Shivaani. Shivaani, wait. - You disgust me. - Shivaani, it's not what you think. - No, then what is it? - She's just a friend. She's from Kenya. - I don't care where she's from, Kabir. - [Kabir] Just come inside, Shivaani. It's not what you think. - You know, when you dishonor me, you dishonor yourself. You dishonor your mother. - No, you're misunderstanding. - I spend a year being patient with you. To give you space to go through all your stuff, but the truth is that you were just like this even before your mother passed away. You don't see me. You only see yourself. I'm done, Kabir. - Done? Done with what? Shivaani, where you going? Shivaani, listen to me please. - You know I didn't want to marry you? - You didn't? - Well, I thought it worked for our parents, so why wouldn't it work for us? I mean it sounded better than all the dating apps and all the other nonsense. It was such a mistake. - No. No, Shivaani, it wasn't a mistake. - I'm not finished. Maybe I'm not a trophy but I'm not a mat that you can just walk all over me. I'm a strong and capable woman, Kabir, and I won't be disrespected like this. I'm done trying to make you happy. I'm done trying to make you notice me. Or to make you feel loved and cared for. I need those things for myself. - I understand that. That's what I'm saying. This is a good start. - I'm really done, Kabir. - [Kabir] Shivaani, I think we need to talk about this please. - Please. Let's just go through the holidays and then we'll get a divorce and you can go back to whatever... life you want. - No, no, no, going back okay. I've had a bad year. That's it. Just come inside. - It's too late, Kabir. - Shivaani, I realize I have wronged you okay. I know that but please understand. You have to know that I-- - You think I don't know? I don't need your confession. - Then I don't know what else to say. - That's it then I guess. - No, Shivaani. Don't go like this. Come inside. We can talk. - Goodbye, Kabir. (gentle music) - Everything okay? - Not really. - I feel like I should go. - No, no you stay. It's okay. - I don't wanna cause any trouble. - Any trouble that I'm in is my fault. - Still I should get home. Can I still get the memory card please? - Oh yes. Sorry. One second. I think it's... Here. - Thanks. Is there anything on it? - No, I don't think so. - If there is, I'll send it to you okay. - Okay. Yeah. Kioni, did you wanna grab some breakfast? - Silly man. (gentle music) - Hey everybody, Mister bah hum bug is here. - Hey Paddy. Meet my friend Kioni. (camera shutter clicking) - Oh Jesus, man. What'd you bring the paparazzi up in here for? - I'm an anthropologist studying the primitive habits of New Yorkers. - I'll take it as a compliment. Where you from? - Kenya. - Kenya? Oh, we have a Christmas special for folk from Kenya today. Food and drinks on the house. - On the house? - [Paddy] Yeah. - He means for free. - You hungry? - [Kioni] Starved. - I'm going get you a Paddy special. - Oh no, you don't want that. - KB, you love the Paddy special, man. Come on. - Paddy, it's not even special. It's french fries, eggs, salsa, gravy, and God knows what else. - [Paddy] It's delicious. - I'll try it and an Irish coffee. - Irish coffee? - [Kioni] Yes please. - You know that's got whiskey in it? - That's the Irish part right? - Okay, okay, okay. She's dangerous. Okay. - Yeah, I'll have the same. - Two Paddy specials. - Thank you. What? - Food ain't gonna make itself, man. - Oh come on, Paddy. Not right-- - But you know where the kitchen is. Get cooking. Come on. - All right sir. - And make it three Paddy specials if you want one for yourself. - [Kabir] All right captain. - So when did you meet Mister Charming? - Yesterday in the city. He showed me around. - What did he show you? - I'm kind of obsessed with Christmas, so I made him show me all the Christmas stuff. - He showed you Christmas stuff? - Yeah. We've been all over. We even went to Brooklyn. - Dyker Heights? - Yeah, it was amazing. - Yeah, sound like the place. You take any pictures there? - Sure, but they're on my other memory card. I can show you the picture I took of you now. - Even better. - Okay. (soft music) - Yeah. - What's this? - What is that? Where'd you take this picture? Hey, what's taking so long, man? - It's coming. It's coming. Paddy, listen, I wanna talk to you about yesterday. - About what? - I wanna apologize, okay? I didn't really mean to say all those things. - You wash your hands? - Yeah, of course. - Liar. Aww, man that's disgusting. - [Kabir] It smells like fresh roses okay. - You're gonna burn the food. - I got it. Listen, I'm just saying that I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say all those things. I was just in a very bad mood. - [Paddy] Really? - Yeah. - You wanna make it up to me? - [Kabir] Sure. - Come to the party tonight. - Party? Shivaani's parents? - [Paddy] Yup. - No Paddy, I don't know about that. Listen, I had a fight with Shivaani this morning. It was just a mess. - You just apologize because you're gonna come to the party. - Come on, don't do this to me. - Man, but you disrespected me. You disrespected Christmas which is the same thing as disrespecting your mom. - Okay now that's a stretch. - You missed the party last year. Don't miss it this year. - That's just not fair. - It's not about what's fair. It's about what's right. Good? Hey, don't burn my food. And don't spit in it either. All right, I know you. (gentle music) - You wanna grab breakfast tomorrow morning? - I'd like that but let's not have the Paddy special okay. - You don't like that? - No, not really. - It wasn't good. - It was horrible. Gravy and salsa? - I warned you. - You should've tried harder. - Listen I hope this isn't a goodbye. - No, of course not. (gentle music) - What do you think about this tree? This tree's about nine, 10 feet. What do you think? Yeah? - You know, it's a little too big. - All right, well I got more trees out here. Come on. Have you been here before? - [Kabir] No. - No? Watch your step over here. I know it's a little bit muddy. Sorry about that. So what size tree you looking for? - Don't know. - Don't know? So I'll give you an example. Like for this tree right here, if you wanna know the size of it, it's right here at the bottom. Take a look. It says five, six foot. Is that something you're looking for? It's a little bit much larger. - That's the one. - That's a good choice. I'll take it to the front for you. - Yeah. - Tie it on your car? - Thank you, yes. - Let's go. Okay.

(soft piano music) - [Shivaani] You shaved. - Yeah. I wanted to talk to you about what happened earlier. - It's okay, I understand. - You understand? - Paddy explained the situation to me. He told me about your friend from Kenya. - You know, you're right. About what you said earlier. I don't know what's next. - We don't have to talk about it right now. - Just. Please. - Okay. - I don't know what's next but I do know that letting you go without trying harder or doing something about it would be a big mistake. Shivaani, you deserve to be happy. And if being apart is what makes you happy, then okay, but I'm not sure that's what I want. You said I only see myself. And I hate to admit it but it's true, but I swear Shivaani I wanna see you, too. I really wanna see you, too. - Thanks. Thank you for saying this. But I can't give you an answer right now. - Yeah, I know. - Maybe after the holidays. - Okay. - Hey. I'm glad you came. - Me too. (soft piano music) Hey. I thought-- What are you doing here? - Paddy invited me. - Oh he did, huh? - He said there's going to be something. - Some what? - He just said that I should be here. - [Paddy] Hey, is everybody having a good time? Are you having a good time? - [Crowd] Yes. - That's more like it. Listen, can you all join me in this room over here please? This next room. Come on, come on, come on. I like the walk. I like the walk. That's good, that's good. Hey everybody. Last year as you all know we lost a dear friend. Aasha. Aasha Bakshi. And if you recall last year, she sang this beautiful song and we thought in honor of her memory. Well just watch for yourselves. All right that's good, that's good, that's good. Okay we're good? Okay Aasha, take it away. - Merry Christmas everyone. This is a beautiful song that my son really loves. We were supposed to sing it together as duet tonight, but since he's not here, he will just have to watch the video. - Come on. - Please. ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Although my heart was aching ¶ ¶ I seemed to know that you'd want to go ¶ ¶ Pride in your manhood waking ¶ ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Boy of mine ¶ ¶ Although my heart was aching ¶ ¶ I seemed to know that you'd want to go ¶ ¶ Pride in your manhood waking ¶ ¶ I'll be here ¶ ¶ Waiting here ¶ ¶ 'Til at the glad dawn's breaking ¶ ¶ I'll hear you say you're home to stay ¶ ¶ Dear little boy of mine ¶ ¶ [Kabir] Mom of mine ¶ ¶ Mom of mine ¶ ¶ It's Christmas and I'm waking ¶ ¶ I'm here to stay ¶ ¶ There's no place to go ¶ ¶ Pride in the merry making ¶ ¶ Mom of mine ¶ ¶ Mom of mine ¶ ¶ I'm here to stay ¶ ¶ There's no place to go ¶ ¶ Pride in the merry making ¶ ¶ Mom of mine ¶ ¶ Mom of mine ¶ Merry Christmas, Mom. You are a tricky man. - Hey, it wasn't me. It was her. - Kioni? - [Paddy] It was all her idea. - But how did you-- - It was on the memory card you gave me. - I don't know what to say. Thank you. Thank you, Paddy, and thank you, Kioni, again. Okay? - Sure. - And now I want you to meet some of these guests. All right come on. After both of you. (bright music) - You look different today. - Why different? - There's a saying in Swahili (speaks in foreign language). - What does that mean? - The letter from the heart can be read on the face. - Is that what you see? A letter from my heart? - I see your heart is happy again. - It really is. - A gift... Because we know each other's secrets. - I will grab your luggage now and thank you for this. So I hope we see each other again some time. - We will. I'm sure of it. - And I wish I had a gift to give you. (camera shutter clicking) - This is enough. - Sweet. You take care. - Bye. (gentle music) You're blushing. - No, I'm not. - Dork. (gentle music) - And Merry Christmas, Kioni. - Merry Christmas. (gentle music) (¶ "A Well Lit Cafe" By Little Red Church ¶)
