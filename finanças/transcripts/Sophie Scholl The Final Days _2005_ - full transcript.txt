This film is based on historical facts, as yet unpublished transcripts, and new interviews with witnesses. THE FINAL DAYS Sugar, I call my baby my sugar I never maybe my sugar That sugar baby of mine He's special ration Funny, he never asks for my money All I give him is honey And that he can spend anytime I'd make a million trips to lips If I were a bee Because he's sweeter than chocolate candy to me I have to go. What are you up to? Gisela. - I see. - Come on. Let's go. See you tomorrow at noon. - In front of the Seehaus? - Yes. - Tell Hans to call me. - I'll tell him. Has he calmed down again? You shouldn't have yelled at him. He's already forgotten. It's about time you came. Come on. Keep going. - Is that all? - All that was left. Our people are shattered by our losses at Stalingrad. The Führer's brilliant strategy sent 330,000 German troops to a senseless death. I'm sure Willi would appreciate your help. Here are the stamps... and the list of names. Thank you, Willi. What about the rest? I'll hand them out on campus. Are you crazy? Things almost ignited when students revolted at the Deutsches Museum. That's why the Gestapo is on red alert! And our slogans on every wall. We'll hide the rest until we get new envelopes. They've run out. Paper shortage. Writing on walls at night is risky enough. But handing out leaflets in broad daylight! You're crazy! We have to take action now! Nazi informers infiltrated the campus after Stalingrad! When the Bolshevists get here, - they'll wipe them out! - You wouldn't want them to get here before the Yanks do! It's insane! Don't do it! I'll go in during the lecture. No one will be in the atrium. I'll be in and out within seconds. Too risky. I'll take the responsibility. I alone. You want to take a full suitcase through Schwabing now? I will. - Don't let Sophie... - It's easier for women to get through. She's right. Okay... March! Alex, see you tomorrow at 12. Tomorrow? The Nazis don't wait either. Thank you. - Don't stay up too long. - Good night. Good night. Dear Lisa, I'm listening to the "Trout Quintet." In Schubert's piece, you can feel and smell the breezes, hear the birds crying out for joy. The piano repeats the motif like cold, sparkling water... It's so enchanting. Please, write soon. Lots of love, Sophie. You think Mother has any jam left? Our ration cards only get us syrup. Inconspicuous enough? The campus will ignite today. Yes. - Good morning. - Morning. We're going to the Psychiatry Dept. Sophie's going to Ulm. I'll be right there. Come on! Come on, let's get out of here! Come on! - There are some left in the suitcase. - What? - There aren't any upstairs. Wait! - I'll go with you. Let's get out of here! Stop! Don't move! Stop! At once! I said stop, damn it! - What's wrong? - You're under arrest! Hands off! You were upstairs! - We were in the Psychology Dept. - No! - You dropped those leaflets! - Nonsense! Let him go. I dropped them down. I'm going to report you. You're both coming with me! This will have consequences! On my campus. "Our people are shattered by our losses..." Come in! So many? Incredible! - Is that all? - Yes, sir. Dismissed! Schmidt, write a report! We'll slap those rosy cheeks! There! That student is hiding something! Give me that! Another leaflet! Give it to me! Or should we force you? This is all part of it. Mohr, police. Here are the two suspects. - And the defamatory leaflet. - I saw them... Your IDs. Yes. - Brother and sister? - Yes. The weaker sex. 21 years old. So, this is the anti-German resistance that has gripped Europe? That young man tried to tear up this paper. Another student gave it to me. I wanted to destroy it to avoid incrimination. Is this your suitcase? It's mine. Take them away! I've arranged for the university to be completely sealed off. Neither the staff - nor the administration may leave. - Yes, sir. Of course, I will also stay here. - Go home and tell Alex not to wait for me! - Quiet! Scholl, Hans, to Mahler for interrogation! Hurry up, Fraeulein. Remove handcuffs. Thank you. Investigator Mohr Come on! Have a seat. Scholl, Sophia Magdalena from Ulm. Born on 9 May, 1921 in Forchtenberg. Protestant. Father? Robert Scholl. He was the mayor of Forchtenberg. Completed training as a children's nurse? Yes. Second residence in Munich 23, Franz Joseph Strasse 13, c/o Schmidt? Yes. - Previous convictions? - No. You admitted to the janitor that you dropped these leaflets from the gallery. They were lying on the marble banister. I gave them a shove as I passed by. Why? Playing pranks is part of my nature. I confessed immediately. I realize that it was stupid of me. I regret it now. The leaflets you dropped at university fall under the jurisdiction of special wartime law. Want to read what you get for high treason and aiding the enemy? I have nothing to do with it. A prison sentence or death. I really have nothing to do with it. A cigarette? No, thanks. You do smoke? Now and then. Fits perfectly. A coincidence. Why did you take an empty suitcase to the university? I was on my way home to Ulm to pick up the laundry I gave my mother last week. Ulm? Such a long trip in the middle of the week? - Yes. - Just for laundry? No. I also wanted to see my girlfriend's new-born child. And my mother is ill. Why the middle of the week? Why so suddenly? My girlfriend is leaving for Hamburg sooner. I wanted to catch the 12:48 express. I was meeting my sister's boyfriend at Central Station. - His name? - Otto Aicher. He arrived in Munich... at 11:30. With "Ei"? With "Ai." Didn't you have any dirty laundry for Ulm? No, I wash small things by hand. So you have no need for clean laundry, but you say you were taking an empty suitcase for clean laundry. For laundry I might need in the next few weeks. Why were you on campus then? I had a date with a girlfriend. Gisela Schertling. We wanted to have lunch at 12. Although you were going to Ulm? I changed my mind last night. I wanted to tell Gisela I couldn't come. Why was your brother with you on campus? You only wanted to cancel a date. We often go to the university together. Hans was going to the Psychiatry Dept. The janitor says you were on the 2nd-floor gallery at 11 o'clock. What for? We were going to meet Gisela, who was at Prof. Huber's lecture - on philosophy. - That's on the 1st floor. As we were early, I showed my brother the Psychology Dept. I often attend lectures there. It's on the 2nd floor. Where were the leaflets? Lying the floor. You didn't read them? I just glanced at them. My brother joked about them. Political jokes? No, he joked about a "waste of paper." He's as apolitical as I am. As female students recently attempted their little revolt during the Gauleiter's speech... Were you there? No. Attendance was mandatory! I stay out of all politics. What's your opinion about what the Gauleiter said in his speech? "Young women should bear a child for the Führer instead of hanging around university." He even promised to give the less pretty girls one of his adjutants. A question of taste. The situation in which you were found makes you a suspect. I recommend you to tell the full truth regardless of any secondary interests. I deny having anything at all to do with the leaflets. Aside from the stupid prank. I realize we are suspects if the real culprits aren't found, but my brother and I have nothing to do with it. Do you think you can hide your true convictions from us? I'm speaking frankly with you. Our staff found no traces of the leaflets in your suitcase. Your brother confirmed what you said. Relieved? I wasn't worried at all. Send in the transcript writer. I'm going to dictate a report. Listen carefully and interrupt me if there are any mistakes. Do you understand? Yes. After that we will put you in one of the cells, but... it depends. Perhaps you can still go to Ulm tonight. Ready? - Metternich! - Yes, sir. - Release form! - Eschenbach! - Yes? - Come with me. You students think you can scare us with your hogwash! Your jewelry, please. Watch. Goebbels: ...to defend our lives by any means. Without consideration for the... Necklace with a pendant. Total War is the demand of the hour! Come with me. We must put an end to the bourgeois attitude which we have also seen in this war. Get undressed, please, and give me your clothes. The danger facing us is enormous. Give me whatever could incriminate you. I'll throw it in the toilet. I'm a prisoner myself. I don't have anything. The time has come to remove the gloves and use our fists. Those who today do not understand... Here we are. ...will thank us tomorrow on bended knees for taking on the task. Enter, ladies! Hurry up, I want to hear the speech! Do you know anything about my brother? He's finished and is waiting upstairs. You're the prime suspect, because you carried the suitcase. And you dropped the leaflets. Don't admit a thing. There's nothing to admit. - How long have you been here? - 1 year and 5 days. I got caught with a letter containing anti-Hitler statements by Ludwig Thoma. - And yet you work for them? - I was ordered to do so. I'm here so you don't kill yourself. Why are you against the Nazis? My brother and I are Communists. Communists stick together. That impressed me. We have to do something. Scholl, Sophia, follow me! I hope we don't meet again. All the best. Yes, all the best. Wait here. This is your release form. Lucky, this time. Registration Desk. Yes, sir! Follow me! Take off your coat. Have a seat. Your father served a 6-week sentence last year for calling our Führer "God's scourge to mankind." He was arrested for slander. His professional license was taken away. I'd like to know why your father ever allowed you to join the Nazi Girls Organization (BDM). Our father never influenced us politically. Typical for a democrat. Why did you join? I heard that Hitler would lead our country to greatness and prosperity and ensure everyone had work and food and was free and happy. You're unmarried? I'm engaged... ...to Fritz Hartnagel. He's a captain on the Eastern Front. Stalingrad. Yes. When did you last see him? Over half a year ago. Seen this before? My brother has one like it. He's a sergeant with the Wehrmacht. What about the 190 bullets in your desk? Caliber 9 mm? They are my brother's. When did you last buy stamps? 2 weeks ago. Where? How many? Post Office 23 in Leopold Strasse. Ten 12-pfennig stamps and maybe five 6-pfennig stamps. - Not more? - No. Ever seen these before? No. Really? No. We found them in your brother's room. Why didn't you tell us he had such a large amount of stamps? You asked where and when I bought stamps. 140 stamps! Who needed these stamps? For what purpose? What was to be sent by mail? Letters to family and friends. - So you've seen them before? - It's an assumption. You found stamps in my brother's room, not in mine. Do you own a typewriter? Our landlady lent us one, so my brother could type. - What? - An essay on philosophy and theology. Not this leaflet? No. Perhaps some philosophical and theological questions like... "Hitler can't win the war, he can only prolong it." Or: "A crime syndicate can never achieve a German victory." Or: "Germany must become a federalist nation." "Freedom of speech." "Freedom of belief." Hans didn't write that. Did you? No. But you believe in such a world order. I am apolitical. This defamatory leaflet was written with the typewriter in your apartment! It was also sent to a number of recipients in Augsburg and Munich! I know nothing about it. Stay seated! Watch her! You were there when your brother tried to destroy this defamatory leaflet. Ever seen it before? No. Read it before making a false statement. "200,000 soldiers were sacrificed for the prestige of a military impostor." What does that remind you of? It sounds very reminiscent of the other 6 leaflets! The handwriting... - Never seen it before. - That's enough! The author of this leaflet is Christoph Probst, a friend from Innsbruck. We found letters from him among your things. It is his handwriting! Also a medical student, thanks to the Führer. A family man with feelings, a love of the mountains of his homeland! A spoiled brat who fouls his own nest while others are dying on the front! Who helped to write the leaflets besides Probst and your brother? Stop making insinuations. You concealed the existence of this evidence, although you are required to tell us everything. I can only admit what I know. Want to hear what your brother said after first beating around the bush, like you? "After I realized that our defeat on the Eastern Front and the increasing military power of England and America made it impossible for us to be victorious, I concluded that there was only one way to prevent further victims and maintain the idea of Europe: shorten the war. Furthermore, I loathed the way we treated the occupied territories." A political statement. It has nothing to do with the accusations. This... is troop demoralization and high treason! I don't believe my brother said that anyway! Oh, you think we're giving you false testimony? Until I hear my brother say that, I won't believe he did. I'm sure you've heard of the Eickemayr studio. Yes. Eickemayr has been working in Krakow as an architect. He gave us the key to his studio, so we could show his paintings to friends. The fingerprints on the copying machine are your brother's. Your brother confessed. He claimed he did everything by himself. He wrote and copied all 6 leaflets... ...and distributed them. He says he distributed 5,000 leaflets alone in Munich one night. Read and signed: Hans Scholl You live with your brother. You were together with him on the gallery this morning. You want us to believe you didn't know about all this? You thought the leaflets were harmless? Admit that you wrote and distributed the leaflets together with your brother! Yes, and I'm proud of it. What will happen to my brother and me? You should have thought of that before. - Will you arrest our family? - That is decided elsewhere. I have to go to the lavatory. Not now! Who wrote the leaflets? I did. You're lying again! We had a scientific report prepared which concludes that the author is probably a man... ...a brain -worker, your brother. Who sent those leaflets? My brother and I. Excuse me, but I really do have to go to the lavatory. The lavatory. Follow me. Hurry up! Take off the handcuffs! You're hurting me! What did you want with them? You know them? Things are starting to roll now. To the left. You know where to go. What about the slogans on the walls: "Down with Hitler"? "Freedom"? The crossed-out swastikas at the university. And on Ludwig Strasse, Marienplatz, - in Schwabing? - My brother and I did that. After his arrest at the university, your brother said, "Go home and tell Alex not to wait for me." Schertling was nearby. He wanted to tell Schmorell to flee. Hans didn't want Schmorell to wait in vain. Did you tell Schmorell about your plans? No. - And Graf? - No. - Why do you keep lying? - I'm not lying. Here. Your confession. Sign it. Read and signed: Take her away. Mohr apparently said to Lohner, "Germany needs people like that. They just need to be re -educated." They may try it with "ideological schooling." But I tell you, they're sure going to be surprised. Why? Even the big-shots are scared stiff. The invasion may come in 8 to 10 weeks, and Germany will be freed. When my mother hears that we've been arrested... she won't be able to take it. She's over 60. She's been ill for months. When the Gestapo knocks on our door again... and they arrest my whole family... - What about your father? - He's 10 years younger. He always gave us a great deal of his strength. Then she won't be alone. Thank you. "We won't be silent. We're your bad conscience. The White Rose won't leave you alone ." - Who are "we"? - My brother wrote that. In the 4th leaflet, it says, "Please copy and forward." Here it even talks about "a resistance movement!" Doesn't sound like lone operators! - There is no group. - What about Willi Graf? A sergeant. A med student. He sometimes comes to see us. We know he helped to copy the leaflets in the studio. You may have found his fingerprints, but he was there at a different time. - When? - Mid-January when we showed the paintings to our friends. That's why other fingerprints are there, too. Who else was there? Schmorell? Maybe. I was there briefly, then I went to a concert. Did Probst distribute the leaflets in Salzburg and Linz? No, Hans never told him, for the sake of his wife and 3 children. Damn it! You have to tell me the whole truth! I expect you to start giving me names at last! Graf, Anneliese? I was only in contact with her 8 to 10 times. - What did you talk about? - Literature and science. - Graf is completely apolitical. - Apolitical, but informed? I insist that she has nothing to do with our leaflets. And Schertling? Gisela and I often get together. She's quite National Socialist-minded. You're saying the Reich is swarming with apoliticals and supporters. Then everything's just fine for you. We know that the White Rose bought 10,000 sheets of paper and 2,000 envelopes in January alone. Who did it? My brother and I. Alright. There were only a few hundred copies of the first 4 pamphlets. But don't tell me that you and your brother printed several thousand copies of the last leaflets all alone and distributed them! We worked day and night. Well done! In addition to the lectures which you attended? Yes, we wanted to create the impression that our resistance is broad-based. We know that your brother served together with Graf and Schmorell and... ...Furtwaengler and Wittenstein. They're all studying here in Munich. Didn't they discuss political beliefs? My brother told me about the horrors of war and not about his comrades. I don't believe you. People are very hesitant to make political statements nowadays. As we can see by your leaflets. - Where did you get the addresses? - Copied from phone books. For example, Stuttgart... On 27 January and the following morning, about 700 leaflets were put into a mailbox. At the same time over 2,000 leaflets were distributed in Munich. It's impossible your brother did it. 2,000 leaflets! I took the express train to Stuttgart on the 27th. And I had the leaflets in my suitcase. After arriving, I put half the envelopes into nearby mailboxes. I left the rest in the suburbs. It's impossible that your brother distributed 2,000 leaflets alone in Munich on 28 January by leaving them in phone books and other public places. - Who helped him? - I didn't take part in Munich. Who financed the leaflets? My father gives me 150 Reichsmarks a month. My brother receives military pay. You both lived on that and paid for the leaflets and stamps, too? Every one of your many trips to Ulm costs 15 Reichsmarks. - We borrowed money from friends. - From whom? Here on the left side at the top is the letter "I ." It stands for "income." - And the name next to the sum probably says who gave you the money. - Yes. Your fiance is also listed. - So he also knew about it. - No. We made up excuses every time. Just ask them. My brother and I are the culprits you want. Have you considered the consequences if you accept full responsibility? We have all the names. Work together with us. It would have a positive influence on the verdict. Think of your poor parents and the shame they will feel. You've accused us of high treason. And now you want me to betray others to save my own skin? Solving a crime has nothing to do with betrayal. My brother's comrades have nothing to do with it! Take her away! I'm worried about Fritz. Why did I write his name in my notebook? Did he know? Not a thing. He didn't notice a thing? No. He is loyal to the oath he swore to Hitler. We often quarreled about it. I refused to support the front, because it only prolongs the war. That upset him. Is he in Stalingrad, too? He was. Fortunately, he was one of the last to be flown to Lemberg. He's at a military hospital there. They amputated two of his fingers. He and his men were outside for weeks exposed to minus 30 degrees C. I really hope he survives without becoming a creature of war. What'll he do when he finds out You're here? He'll understand. Hopefully. What's he like? Tall, dark-haired. A free thinker. He always made me laugh. Love which is simply free is a wonderful thing. When did you last see him? Last summer. We were at the North Sea. We'd take a fishing boat out at the crack of dawn... ...and a carriage to the mudflats in the evening. We'd sing at night and talk about peace. No soldiers anywhere. No planes, no bombs. Just the sea, the sky... ...the wind and our dreams. Dear God, all I can do is stammer to You. I can do nothing but hold out my heart to You. You created us in Your likeness. Our hearts are uneasy until they find peace in You. Amen. Here, drink it. This is real coffee. You are also concerned about the German people's well-being. Yes. You didn't cowardly plant a bomb like Elser did in Munich in '39. You may have used false slogans... but you used peaceful means. So why do you want to punish us? Because It's the law. Without law there's no order. The law you're referring to protected free speech before the Nazis came to power in 1933. Someone who speaks freely now is imprisoned or put to death. Is that order? What can we rely on if not the law? - No matter who wrote it. - On your conscience. Nonsense! Here is the law, and here are the people. As a criminologist, it is my duty to find out if they coincide, and if not... ...to find the rotten spot. The law changes, conscience doesn't. What would happen if everyone separately decided what is right or wrong? What would be left, if criminals actually toppled the Führer? Criminal chaos! So-called free thinking, federalism, democracy? We know what it leads to. Without Hitler and his Party there'd be law and order for everyone. Everyone would be safe from arbitrary acts. Not only the yes-men. How dare you make such derogatory remarks! Derogatory is calling my brother and me criminals because of some leaflets! We've only tried to convince people with words! You and your kind shamelessly abuse your privileges! You can study in wartime, thanks to our money! I was only a tailor in that damn democracy! Know who made me a policeman? The French who occupied us. Not the German democrats! Without the movement, I'd still be a country policeman. That disgusting Treaty of Versailles, inflation, unemployment, poverty... Our Führer Adolf Hitler eliminated all that! And he led Germany into a bloody war where every victim dies in vain! A heroic struggle! You get the same coupons as the people you're fighting against! You're much better off than people like me! You don't need to do this! How dare you raise your voice! The Führer and the German people are protecting you! Here in Wittelsbach Palace? By arresting my family? Our German soldiers are freeing Europe from plutocracy and Bolshevism! Fighting for a free Germany! Never again will Germany be occupied! Until the war is over, and foreign troops march in, and the world points its finger at us for tolerating Hitler. What will you say when the Final Victory is won? When freedom and prosperity blossom? That was your vision when you joined the BDM! In Hitler's Germany everyone has lost that belief. What if I'm right? You're a Protestant? Yes. The church also requires devotion even if you doubt. People attend church voluntarily. Hitler and the Nazis give us no other choice. Why do you risk so much for false ideas? Because of my conscience. You're so gifted, why don't you think and feel like us? Freedom, honor, prosperity, a morally responsible government. That is our conviction. Weren't your eyes opened by the terrible bloodbath the Nazis carried out in the name of freedom and honor? Germany will be disgraced forever if its youth doesn't topple Hitler and build a new intellectual Europe. The new Europe can only be National Socialist. What if your Führer is insane? Take racial hatred. We had a Jewish teacher in Ulm. He was placed before a group of SA men. They had to spit in his face. That night he disappeared. Like thousands in Munich. Allegedly to work in Eastern Europe. You believe that nonsense? The Jews are emigrating. Soldiers coming from the East talk of extermination camps. Hitler wants to exterminate all European Jews! He was preaching that madness 20 years ago. How can you believe the Jews are different than we are? That mob brought us misfortune, but you are confused. You have no idea. The wrong education. Maybe It's our fault. I'd have raised a girl like you differently. Do you realize how shocked I was to find out that the Nazis used gas and poison to dispose of mentally ill children? My mother's friends told us. Trucks came to pick up the children at the mental hospital. The other children asked where they were going. "They're going to heaven," said the nurses. So the children got on the truck singing. You think I wasn't raised right, because I feel pity for them? These are unworthy lives. You trained to be a nurse. You saw people who were mentally ill. Yes, and that's why I know. No one, regardless of circumstances, can pass divine judgment. No one knows what goes on in the minds of the mentally ill. No one knows how much wisdom can come from suffering. Every life is precious. You have to realize that a new age has dawned. What You're saying has nothing to do with reality. Of course it has to do with reality. With decency, morals and God. God doesn't exist! Isn't it true... that you relied on your brother, that it was right what he did? And you just took part? Shouldn't we write that in the report? No, because It's wrong. I have a son, too, who's even a year younger than you. He sometimes had crazy ideas. Now He's on the Eastern Front, because he understood he has to do his duty. Do you believe in the Final Victory? If you'd considered everything, you'd never have let yourself get dragged into this! Your life is at stake. Here... For the record, I ask you: "Following our talks, have you come to the conclusion that your action together with your brother can be seen as a crime against society and in particular against our hard fighting troops and that it must be harshly condemned?" No, not from my point of view. By admitting your mistake you wouldn't betray your brother. But I'd betray the idea. I'd do the same again. You have the wrong world view, not me. I still believe that I acted in the best interests of my people. I don't regret it. And I'll accept the consequences. Transcript writer. Yes. Tell the chief we're finished. Mohr offered me a way out if I abandoned our idea. - And? - I didn't accept. Why not? You're still so young. You have to survive for your idea! And for your family. For God's sake, accept his offer. There's no way back. Air-raid warning. Get down! Get away from the window! It's safest down here! Get down! It won't be long until we're free. The new prisoner isn't Schmorell. His name is Christoph Probst. Also accused of high treason. I'm sorry. I thought... He has 3 children. The youngest was just born. His wife has child-bed fever. Your prosecutor is expecting you. Keep going! Here is my indictment. Your trial is tomorrow morning at the People's Court in Munich. I included a written summons. - Tomorrow? - We can't afford any delays. High treason, troop demoralization, aiding the enemy. And the trial is tomorrow! What a beautiful sunny day! I beg You from the bottom of my heart. I beseech You. I beseech Thee, even though I know nothing about You. You alone are my salvation. I beg of You, please don't turn away from me, dear God. My glorious Father. Amen. My name is Klein, your court-appointed counsel. Have you read the indictment? Yes. Any questions? What will happen to my family in Ulm? Please. Other authorities will decide. I want to know what will happen. You're my lawyer! You talk as if I'm responsible for your situation! It's my right to know what will happen to my family. You feel entitled to make demands? No matter what verdict my brother gets, mine should not be more lenient. I'm as guilty as him, in your opinion! You have nothing more to say? - No! - You and your brother feel you don't have to fit in to society! But You're wrong! The President of the People's Court is coming from Berlin tomorrow! He will set you straight! He'll make you feel this small! Open up! - Something wrong? - No. I'll see you in court tomorrow. Wretched coward! Freisler will call you criminals. He was a Soviet Commissar. He has to rehabilitate himself on the home front. Our father says, "I want you to live honest and free lives, even though it may be difficult." ls it a public trial? Yes. It will be a show trial to deter others. Freisler will have to talk about our leaflets in public, and everyone can hear what we think. Students will revolt after hearing what happened to us for a few leaflets. After the trial, you will be moved. And if worse comes to worst, everyone is given 99 days until execution. "A strong spirit, a tender heart," says my brother. I dreamed I was carrying a child in a long white dress. I felt its warmth. Suddenly the earth shook, and right beneath me a crevasse opened up. I started slipping. I looked at the child and had just enough time to put it in safety. I fell, and yet I felt released and relieved. The child in the white dress is our idea. And it survived. Prepare to be transferred! Let her get dressed first! Thank you. God be with you, Sophie. God be with you, Else. Thank you. Freedom How are you? - And you? - Quiet! Only speak when spoken to! - Fight for yourself. - Quiet! I hereby begin the proceedings of the People's Court in the case against Hans Fritz Scholl and Sophia Magdalena Scholl from Munich and Christoph Probst from Aldrans, charged with high treason, troop demoralization, and aiding the enemy! You are married and have 3 children? Yes, one is 2 1/2, one is 1 1/4, and one is 4 weeks old. How can a failure like you raise 3 children to be true Germans? - I'm a good father and... - What... "and"? ...and apolitical. Apolitical? What a laugh! This is your handwriting? Yes. Neither the fact that the Reich paid for your education, nor that National Socialist policies enabled you to have a family while studying prevented you from writing this manuscript after being asked to do so by Scholl. You mention the heroic battle of Stalingrad as a reason to call the Führer a military impostor and to call for surrender! Do you admit it? Yes, sir. But it was only a rough draft. There is no "only" in the Germans' fight for survival! - I want to say you that I suffered from a psychotic depression. - So! A psychotic depression is to blame for all this? I was suffering from depression when I wrote it. The war... my wife's child-bed fever... Stop wailing! That is no excuse for such disgusting treason! I retracted my statement yesterday. I offered neither financial or material support, nor did I print leaflets to endorse such an operation. - My emotional state... - We've heard your claims to be a psychopathic idiot in order to get away with it! President, my children need a father. German children don't need such a rotten role model! You are unworthy! Any questions from the defense? No, President. Take him away! You've been studying medicine since the spring of 1939? Yes. Thanks to the support of the National Socialist government, for 8 semesters. 8 semesters is correct. At the expense of the Reich! Another one of these parasites! You also worked at a field hospital in France and on the Eastern Front from July to November 1942 as a medical aide? Correct, but... Don't speak unless spoken to! I am not a parasite... Shut up! Or I'll have you taken away! As a member of the student company it is my duty to study. Ah, why don't we talk about duty? It is your duty as a student to work for the community. That, and the support you were provided by the Reich, didn't prevent you in early summer of 1942 from publishing leaflets from the White Rose which predicted Germany's defeat and called for passive resistance and to sabotage armaments. They also demanded that the German people be robbed of their government and the National Socialist way of life! - Outrageous! - A disgrace! - Traitor! Is that true? - Yes. - And, like a coward, you dragged your sister into it! It was my decision. Did I ask you, defendant? - I must put it right! - Spare us your comments! Did you write those leaflets, because you believe that the German people can only survive the war by betraying the Führer? - War... - Yes or no! What's so difficult about that? We don't stand a chance against America, England and Russia. Just look at the map. Hitler is leading Germany to disaster with mathematical precision. He can no longer win the war. He can only prolong it. You are gravely mistaken about the Germans' will to fight and their perseverance! Your terrorist aid to the enemy will cause the death of more German soldiers! Only by ending the war now can we prevent... End the war? How? Do you think you can decide whether we have war or peace? The German people want Total War! Germany is bleeding to death and wants peace! Hitler and his helpers are to blame for this European massacre which knows no bounds! - Everyone here knows... - Who do you think you are? You dishonorable dog! Insulting the Führer in court! I was on the Eastern Front, as were many others here. You weren't. I saw streams of blood with my own eyes in Poland and Russia. I saw women and children... ...shot by German soldiers. Are you really so stupid as to think that even one German would believe that nonsense? If you and Hitler weren't afraid of our opinion, we wouldn't be here. Shut up! It's all just... That dishonorable scoundrel! You're nothing but a... fool! And a miserable traitor! End of examination! - Any questions? - No. No questions, President. Step down. Aren't you ashamed of distributing traitorous leaflets at the university? No, I'm not. You just threw them into the atrium? I didn't just throw them. I wanted... Speak up! I can hardly hear you! - I wanted to distribute the last leaflets so our idea... - Idea! You call this filth an "idea"? The product of some idiots! Not worthy of German students! - We fight with words. - You wrote in fact: "Therefore you must denounce National Socialist sub-humanism." Take a look at yourself, you'll see who's sub-human here. Where did you get the paper for these pamphlets? - From shops and the university. - I see! From the university! Malicious theft of national property! Paper, of course! Which is so scarce! That is typical of such traitors! My brother and I wanted those leaflets to open people's eyes and to put an end to the terrible slaughter of other peoples and Jews even sooner than it will be ended by the Allies. Shall our nation be forever cast out by all mankind? A master race doesn't care! Your master race really wants peace. It wants human dignity to be respected again. It wants God, conscience and empathy. Who do you think you are? Total War will bring victory to the German people! They will emerge greater and purified by this storm of steel! The thoughts we have expressed and written are shared by many. They just don't dare to speak up. Will you be quiet! Questions? No. The hearing of evidence is over. Take her away! Now we come to the closing statements of the defendants. I'm the father... Remove these people from the courtroom! I'm Robert Scholl, father of two of the defendants! - I want to say something in defense... - Not permitted! Get him out of here! There is a higher justice! Quiet! Now the closing statements! Stand up, defendants! I beg you to spare my life, for my children. I confessed everything. And you? I beg the court to spare this man and punish me. If you can't speak for yourself, then be silent! You will soon be standing where we stand now. Every decent person in this courtroom is outraged by what you say! In the name of the German people, in the criminal case against Hans Fritz Scholl from Munich, Sophia Magdalena Scholl from Munich, and Christoph Hermann Probst from Aldrans, the People's Court has reached a verdict following court proceedings on 22 February, 1943: The defendants published leaflets at a time of war, calling for people to sabotage armaments and to overthrow our people's National Socialist way of life. They propagated defeatist ideas and viciously insulted the Führer. By so doing, they aided the enemy and demoralized our troops. They are therefore sentenced to death. They lose their rights as citizens for all time. They bear the cost of the trial. Your terror will soon be over! You may hang us today. But you'll be hanged tomorrow. Take them away! This way! If you want to write a farewell letter, do it quickly. Today? I thought everybody has 99 days. Better start writing. My beloved Fritz... Follow me. You have visitors. Visitors? Please, don't worry. I'd do the same again. You did the right thing. I'm proud of you both. My little girl. How bravely you stand by me. Now you'll never come through our door again. We'll meet in eternity. Don't forget, Sophie... Jesus. Yes, Mother. But you neither. It's time. I just said goodbye to my parents. You'll understand. Follow me. My name is Alt. I'm the prison minister. My God, glorious Father, transform this ground into fertile earth, so Your seeds may not fall in vain. Let the longing grow for You the Creator that they so often do not want to see. I ask you for God's blessing. May God the Father bless you who created you in His image. May God the Son bless you whose suffering and death redeems you. May God the Holy Spirit bless you who leads you to His temple and hallows you. May the Trinity judge you with mercy... and grant you eternal life. Amen. No one loves more than one who dies for friends. God is with you. It's against the rules, but... Hurry please. Thank you. It wasn't in vain. The sun's still shining. In his decree from 22 February, 1943, the Reichsminister of Justice chose not to grant a reprieve, but instead to let justice take its course. It is exactly 5 p.m. The execution is to be carried out. Long live freedom! The so-called People's Court imposed the death sentence on these members of the White Rose: Harsh sentences were imposed on: Other members of the White Rose suffered draconian punishments. Thanks to Helmut Von Moltke, the 6th leaflet of the White Rose was taken to England via Scandinavia. In mid-1943, millions of copies were dropped by Allied planes over Germany. They now bore the title: "A German Leaflet, Manifesto of the Students of Munich"
