What's your name? Joseph. Call whenever you want. To say what? Everything you can't tell your mother. You know my mother? I don't do it for the money. I'm just advertising. Keep your money. THE JOY OF SINGING Give us your clients, suppliers and account numbers! You can't decide? Give him air! I have another idea. We'll break your fingers! - You choose. - We're losing him, shit! Anyone know CPR? He's dead. We're gonna get killed! Shut up, you sing off-key. Can't you stop smoking? That's new! You look stupid. You don't swallow the smoke. - Your breath will stink. - We're not kissing anymore. I never should've slept with you, Boss. You sound like an old man! Rambling on like that... Are my teeth yellow? Honestly, do you see me as a mother? No, Boss. Could you take your feet down? I know, I'm late. Spare me your dirty looks. There was fog over Brussels. Here, everything's inside. The situation is critical. When's our work not critical? Then the minister makes a call and we've worked for shit. You're not paid to have qualms. We need something concrete and quick! What happened? You both look beautiful. Did you sleep together? I'll be in touch with you. Don't start getting too fond of each other. It's against our deontology. Given the situation, stay focused. This is your fault. Have you resolved your baby issue? Of course I resolved it. Then stop seeing your gynaecologist. Enough's enough. It's because I got my period early. I was 10. Isn't that early? It's common. Many girls do. Young girls are impatient to become women. And women dream of becoming young girls again. What kind of world is this? I could've gotten pregnant for 25 years now. At least once. Something, an inkling of fertility! But no, nothing. I never miss a period. Do you really want a child? Fertility attracts men. Well, the possibility... It's unbelievable to be this sterile. I only sleep with guys who are barely post-pubescent. They're insipid and hairless... The idea of fatherhood hasn't spurted out yet. I'm pathetic! You need to fall in love. Yeah, you're right. I've got to stop buzzing around and find the princess in me. There... Hans Muller. Died of a heart attack. Violently tortured. Let's not cry over it. Hans Muller. Banker, music-lover, won several piano competitions, but chose banking. He helped rogue states traffic enriched uranium. And pocketed a commission, of course. - Why don't you have wrinkles? - Please stop. Boss. Do you think an "axis-of-evil" country could blackmail the free world with a nuclear bomb? And boom! It makes no sense. We just need to get his USB key. They want Muller's organigram. Some will obviously get killed... A useless investigation and still no kid. Look... Constance Muller. Mixed up or not? We're not sure. Sources say Hans gave her the USB key. In order to pin her down, we have to join her opera class. I hate opera! - What do you like? - No idea. We have no info on the classes, but since the widow joined, it's crawling with secret agents. No, we said we were working! Now what? I don't know. I'm hesitating. Is it you who smells so good? You smell like fig pie. My mum forbids me to eat cakes. Breathe! I'm on a protein diet. Do I look thin? I'm allergic to perfume. - All women smell the same. - Not at all. My mother smells of quinces. And that girl, lemons. She's sour, like her voice. Very good. Thank you, Anna. See you next week for your lesson. - Goodbye. - See you soon. I'm Muriel, I called. Yes, I remember. Go behind the music stand, please. Put down your things. Perfect. I'm going to teach you the "Petite Rossini". This is how it goes... Repeat after me like a parrot. Good. Sorry... Continue. You're doing great! Stand up straight. Now you look ten years younger! - How old do you think I am? - Age is irrelevant in singing. What do you mean? You don't know how to breathe. And you're not using your diaphragm at all. Let's take a look. A little more here. It makes me choke. That's because you have clavicular breathing. I want you to breathe from way down here. Yes, that's perfect. Now hold it. Hold it! Yes, very good! 8:00 yoga, 9:30 breakfast, 11:00 Tai Chi, 12:30 lunch, 1:30 she goes out to jog from the Concorde to St Germain on the south sidewalk. Then, she stops and buys some French and foreign pop. - She's like clockwork. - Really? - I thought she liked opera. - Everyone's a paradox. - You, for example... - No theories, please! Trust me when it comes to female psychology. Why doesn't she react when her bag gets stolen? She lets the mugger go as if it were normal. Is she passing information or is she afraid? He looks dumb, but he's cute. My exact opposite. How do you read this? As if I could learn notes at my age! I'm dying to take another class. It's fun and it makes my inner walls vibrate. The widow has class in an hour, shall we go to her place? Yes, I'm DX... What's my ID? 1939-XD-45. I don't have the keys, they tear my pockets. I have no patience with these young girls. Yes, ID 1939-XD-45. Requesting door code for 10 rue Auber. Yes, 10 rue Auber. Thank you, it works. - Do you remember my ATM pin code? - Yes. What I like best about you is your pretty little ass. - Can I work? - Turn around then, you're exciting me. There's no trace of uranium in here. Softly... Bravo, Xavier! Thank you. See you next week. - Hello, Constance. - Hello, Eve. - How are you? - Fine. - He has a lovely man's voice. - Doesn't he? It's masculine, it's wonderful. He really has a beautiful voice. Come in. Go take your place. The "Petite Rossini". Very good. Yes, yes, yes! Breathe. Excellent! Now some "na"... Come now, Constance, what's wrong? Nothing. I'm sorry. It's okay, just tell me what's wrong. My husband... He was a music-lover but always said that I sang off-key. That's too bad. You sing very well. You're doing just fine, my dear Constance. Shall we continue? Let's go. Perfect, now open your eyes wide. Yes, let's continue. Wonderful. You don't listen to enough music. - Do you have an MP3? - A what? A Walkman. Of course not, you must be kidding! Take mine then. It's awesome. You hardly even need to charge it up. You push here for play, and here to stop. I'll explain it in detail later. And what can I do for you? You should do something with your voice. My mother tells me that every day. I don't need auditions... It's not my thing. In any case, I go to pieces during exams. You know, my sister-in-law, No√©mie, knows lots of people in opera. All of Paris consults her. Maybe she can help out. I'll come with you. It'll be great. I should go. I don't want to get too attached. Can I kiss you goodbye? You're so pure. If only Hans could've been like you. I think you're right, don't change. Inviting me to spend the night? I said we're not having sex. I didn't ask you to have sex with me. I don't like sleeping alone, neither do you. No. Find someone else. I want to be with a girl who's interested in me, who I don't see every day, who misses me and isn't afraid of ageing. I have a question. You don't know how to ask questions. You're too direct, no one wants to answer you. It's always an interrogation with you. I've got a question for you. When's the last time you had sex? When's the last time we slept together? I was wondering if you can be fond of a man without being in love with him. You have a knack for making me impotent. One day our prince will come. Mine will be handsome, young and blind. I'll take his horse to get out of here. Hands off! You see, I can't. Maybe it's because I'm your superior... Not at all. It almost worked last time. You're so damn insistent. Don't you ever let up? You stress me out! I can't just fuck a girl for the fuck. I never could. Dammit. You're too into performance. We're not at war. We can come in peace. Good night. Excuse me. I have the feeling someone rummaged around my apartment again. I also forgot to tell you... My purse was stolen again. The second time this week. I'm starting to get scared. Stop imagining things. My brother was not a dealer. He was an honest banker. Don't soil our family's memory. His only wrongdoing was stopping piano. But now you're the musician! Don't betray him with pop. Say, can I sing you a new song? Don't worry, I'm not quitting opera. Even great opera singers sang summer hits. You're ridiculous. Well, at the moment I'm not well and I'm scared. Can I sleep at your place? Or you come here, whatever you prefer. That Joseph is absolutely delicious. He sings like an angel, but he's afraid to take the leap. Do you know someone who can help him? He's rotting at home. I'm not a placement office, I'm bound by professional secrecy. Great layout. I don't have your talent. You're like your brother. Rigid and rigorous. Joseph looks at me like I was the woman of his dreams. It's strange. He should go to India or Easter Island like other lost souls. His mother already called me. I can't help every kid who wants to sing Faust. They're all 20-year-old whores. They think a firm ass and an innocent smile is enough to make us beg for their youth, love and tenderness. No one helped me. And no one helped you. We're free women. We don't owe anything to anyone. Enough talking. I'm tired, I have to get up early. You're wrong. Joseph is a darling boy. He's a love. He gave me his MP3. And you can also use it as a USB key. By the way, what's a USB key? You don't know what a USB key is? There's lots I don't know. It's better that way. - You prefer stupidity and blindness? - No, peace and innocence. Good luck. I know, I'm wrong. But since I started singing lessons, I've learned how to become an interpreter. And I want to interpret my life perfectly. Not necessarily write the score. I'd like to introduce two new students. This is Muriel. She has sung before but this is her first repertory class. And this is Philippe. He's never had any singing lessons before. Right? Never. No one's perfect. Absolutely. Well, I'm thrilled. Take your places and we'll get started. Hold your hands tight to feel the energy. That's right. Good. Now after me... Let's go. It's a flower, not a roast beef! Come on, as if you were smelling flowers. Very good. Perfect. One more time. You can let go of your hands. I'd now like each of you to express yourselves. I'm fed up. I'm scared. Mum doesn't believe in God but she always swears by him. You have no spirituality, just music. I feel like crying. I feel guilty of assuming a place that's not mine. I don't know if I'm where I should be, here with you singing... I want a child. I'm a Bariton-Martin. I don't know what that is, but it makes me vibrate deeply. It almost makes me cry. That's why girls go crazy when they hear any jackass sing. Luckily, they're all fat and ugly in opera. You think I'm fat? Protein diets aren't good. I was on it and was a holy pain in the ass. Well, in two days I get to have whole-wheat bread. That's the end of phase one. I didn't say you could take my picture. You don't like to leave a trace? I had a friend who never wanted her picture taken on trips. Today nobody remembers her. Young people think they're ugly. Then later, the photos are a happy surprise. I wasn't very good tonight. I'm much better alone with your mother. It's the same for everyone. The goal is singing for yourself and loved ones. You're both so beautiful. You should do a duet. Thank you. You're like an ogress. The more you eat, the hungrier you get. - What did I do now? - Julien... You're eating him up alive. Not at all, he could be my son! Stop with the ageing thing. It's a turn-off. Every day I get a new wrinkle. My face is sagging. You're wrinkle-free because you're expressionless. To get old, you have to smile. Why don't you smile? We're on a mission and aren't supposed to know each other. I realize I don't know you. Luckily singing has united us. Right. Bon app√©tit, Boss. You sure spend a long time in the bathroom. What were you doing? Nothing. I mean... nothing in particular. You have a wrenching voice. Excuse me, I have to wash my hands. I'll get a paper towel. That girl disgusts me. She stinks of sex. Then go fuck a yogurt! I don't know. - Does anyone want to share a cab? - Good idea. I work in public relations. News, communication and information. That's why I feel safe with you. You're open and interested in everything. You're so curious. It's wonderful. It's a gift. I'm shy. I'm not concentrated enough on others. I think I suffer from egocentrism. Don't worry, singing is a... universal remedy. You have a slight accent, don't you? No, I'm Parisian. But I speak seven languages. I'm like a chameleon. After a week in a country, people think I'm a native. I love accents. They make me weak in the knees. My grandmother was Polish and her accent embarrassed me. Do I embarrass you? Not at all. Let's go to a disco! I haven't seen a dance floor in twenty years! What did your brother do with his computer? Everything was erased when I found it. I've told you. I think my sinusitis is back. It's the Paris air. You're getting weak. You didn't used to be afraid of a cold. I'm telling you it's sinusitis with polyps. Did you follow the treatment? Obviously not and you lost it. Fifty drops a day and don't stop half way through. Is it chemical? I only use certified organic plants. You're a witch. Speaking of witches... What's up with your sister-in-law? We're not alone in the singing class. There are other forces. Will you suck my nipples? You have sensitive nipples? Yeah. Don't you? Go on, bite them. Harder. Rip them off! What do you do with your fingers? - In general? - No, now. Go on, dig deep! I've done porno. Fuck me! You're very up-front. That's pushing it. You think too much. Take what comes! Well, I'm not really used to this... You want my ass or not? Wow, Bariton-Martins sure can hit high notes! Boss, it's me. I wanted to know where you were. I'm going home. I'm leaving my cell on all night. Good night, Boss. Chorus: Life could be so lovely... My husband's snoring prevented me from sleeping. Your slumber is so deep. My soul's at peace. It makes sleeping easy. I have to go. I have numerous appointments. Sleep, little lady. If someone buzzes the interphone, don't answer. Just slam the door when you leave. I searched her place. She's with French Intelligence. You wanted something concrete. We said sleep with Constance, not with Intelligence! I'm afraid of Constance. She's hiding something. I'm sure she killed her husband. It has to be safe for me. You promised. Whores come a dime a dozen. You don't want to? You're replaceable. But whores who know how to sing are rare. The singing teacher says my voice is unique and moving. You take the lessons! You might be more efficient. I can't take the risk and my voice never seduced anyone. I'll have Constance. I don't think she likes my voice. You're dying to know if I slept with a suspect. Your private life doesn't concern me. Your Julien writes like a kid. Did he ever learn how to write? Why does everyone want to write shit songs like this? You're my private life. I don't need a justification or an explanation. All that matters is finding that USB key. - You taught me that. - I wish I were like you. Top of the class. Conscientious and inflexible. Someone tried to kill me last night. You're saying that to soften me. Kiss me. I'm telling you to be careful when you're alone. I'm your Boss. I protect you. - Enriched uranium makes people mad. - Like money. Or men. Yes... But only when they have hard-ons, otherwise they're just pets. Was that for me? His name is Julien Duverger. He's not in our database. All we know is that he's a whore, a freelance escort-boy. - A whore? - Are you shocked? He was eliminated from "Pop Academy" after just one week. Then nothing. He disappeared, vanished. Well, I guess that's it. Julien isn't a whore. He loves his body too much to sell it. That's enough to exonerate him? That's light-hearted of you. There's a first for everything. - How do you find my body? - It has become irrelevant. If at least I was entitled to your jealousy. Good. Emphasize the "F". Can't he go out? No, he stays. You need an audience. An audience is good. No, lighter than that... Lighter and more romantic. So, two months at four times a week... How many times a night? Let's simplify it... Twenty times sixty: 1,200. In 1,200 times, no one has ever licked my feet. You're the first. You're incredibly hairy for someone with little hair. Do you shave? No. It belongs to a lover, a bear. A bear? What do you mean? Teddy bear. Hairy. Fat. Lover. The world is composed of several thousand competent nuclear engineers. They all have sufficient knowledge to make a rudimentary bomb for the purposes of terrorism. Some sell their knowledge, some will do it out of conviction. Those are the best candidates. They cost less than the others, and it's easier to insure their discretion. That's one less problem to worry about. Now the material. I've already told you that this terrorist organization must have access to uranium 235. There are two possibilities... Were you at that conference by chance? I screwed up my university years. So, you're interested in nuclear terrorism? Sushi... I never know which fish is in my mouth. I should stop. I'm trying to understand... I have the feeling that my husband knew a lot of people in that world. I don't understand. You don't know how to ask questions. You're looking for confessions. 100 euros. Are you serious? Not expensive enough? It's 100 euros. I didn't pay the first time. I'm like a shrink, the first time is free. My goal in life is that every day is my first time. You're bound to age prematurely. Why? Do I have wrinkles? A whore at 20 is cute, but at 30? You should learn a new trade. I'm missing an euro. On the house. - What are you doing? - I lost my ring. I don't have enough money to pay for foreplay. I lack professional integrity. It was a marketing bonus. See ya. You could've told me this place rents by the hour! Are you talking about room 505? You have to be indulgent with youth. Why? Did you sleep with him too? Is this hair yours? No, I never leave a trace. I went to hotel school. You should come at the end of the month. He goes "on sale" to make ends meet. I hate sales. It's last year's models. Then whose hair is it? Come in. Make yourself at home. If you want something to drink, it's in there. I'll be right back. I told her not to answer the interphone! Do you have a car? I have a Smart. I got it for my 35th birthday. - Nothing bigger? - Well, there's Hans' car. It's a... I forgot. It was very big, but I sold it. I forgot to empty out the trunk. He put tons of things inside. Who did you sell it to? To a wonderful Libyan family. They spoke Russian, it was strange. They bought used cars for Africa. One of my sister-in-law's clients or one of her tenants. I talk too much. The water is still hot. Maybe she's not dead. It's so unfair that she's dead. - Give her mouth-to-mouth. - You do it. You slept with her, right? How do you know? You guess everything. It's true. I slept with her. Don't stare at me, I'm not guilty. Your private life doesn't concern me. - You're looking at me strangely. - It doesn't concern me! When I left, she was asleep. I felt her breath on my breast. Can you lend me a rug? A big one. - Who are you calling? - My sister-in-law. We're close. We share all our secrets. Since Hans died, she lives through me. So, if there's a cadaver here she might have one too. No√©mie, I love you, you know! I've got to go. Are you finished? What if we used trash bags? For her head and feet. - Why are you stopping? - It's heavy. Something smells strange! It's Anna's perfume. A mix of patchouli and fig. It also made me choke at first, but you get used to it. Promise you'll never sleep with me. I'm bad luck. Do you remember? Go to my place, 12 rue Lucien David. I'll get rid of the body and meet you there. Why are you so nice to me? Why are you so generous? They say you have to give to receive. I don't see anything. Everything is clear. It's all in your head. Speaking of... I also need a scan of my head. And of my body, if possible. Listen, miss. Stop. You're acting like a little girl. If we keep looking, we'll find something. But it better not attack my vocal cords, they're growing on me. And my fallopian tubes. Get out. I said no text messages, no e-mails, no phone. Sorry, it was an emergency. You call that an emergency! You have a number for that kind of intervention! I tried calling. They put me on hold and then I got cut off. No one's more efficient than you. Brown-noser. Give me the keys and the documents. Constance sold Muller's car with a full trunk. - You believe that? - I don't know. Yeah, I do. I just moved and forgot to empty out a closet. Your place is very minimalistic. Like me. It needs a feminine touch. The female here is me. I live like an old maid. Be careful, it's very hot. Turn it off! No, turn it back on! Turn it on! It reminds me of my first crush. I don't remember his name. He was so handsome! It was the era of straight-leg pants that gave you a great derriere and legs like chopsticks. And I was young and pretty and so carefree! I wonder why I ever married Hans Muller. You know, I still can't speak German. I tried for 12 years. I never could put the verb at the end... the way you should. Want me to write French lyrics for this? - You also write songs? - Yes. Songs have to be simple in the summer because people are slower. You have to make it easy for them. That's the secret to summer hits. Here. It's a MP3 player and it's for you. For me? How sweet of you, but Joseph already gave me his. Who's Joseph? Joseph. You know him. The singing teacher's son. Did you sleep with him? - I'm working. - You were right. He's a whore. Don't come in. I'm your supervisor. I demand that you let me in. I demand a report. And you can't drop me. What do you mean you "demand"? Strange initiative to bring the widow back home. I thought I was the only one in your heart. Is it for the investigation? She's a predator. Or a saint. I'm not sure. But if you want to take over, be my guest. You should've told me you already had a singer in your life. Muriel, I swear that all we did was talk and listen to music. We're not a couple. Go ahead, the place is free. I'm not a parking place. I want to be alone. By the way, you didn't return the keys of the Smart. What do you think? Really? I liked my little Smart. I'm not staying either. Good night, Constance. Good night, Philippe. I'll walk out with you. Now what? Get the DNA analysed on this. Don't look surprised, it's hair. - Human? - I hope so. I killed her. I left her in the apartment. She was also looking for the damn USB key. We're all after it. It's the first time I killed someone. I feel dirty. Am I still handsome? She worked for the Russian suppliers or for the Mossad. You did a good job. I'm proud of you. Here. It's not a fake, is it? Why would we give you a fake? Stop seeing evil everywhere. - And Constance? - I hate singing class. It's a wasp's nest. Everyone spies and sings. Everyone does everything! Everyone scares me. Look down my throat. It hurts when I swallow. If Constance doesn't fall in love with you in 24 hours, you're dead. You say that just after you gave me a watch! When I first checked your tonsils, you agreed to work for us. Now you're fine, and you're not abandoning us. When you checked my tonsils, you didn't speak of uranium. This is all against my principles. Who taught you how to recruit? I don't want to go! You sing French pop so well, it's as if it were innate. You're a widow. You're alone. You have no kids. Despite that, you still have a joie de vivre. Everything seems to slide off of you. Don't you wish people looked at you more? Devoured your body and face? I wish I were a feast. I wish I were the only one. Only me. The only woman in the world. You think singing makes us megalomanic? Because I'm just like you. In secret, I dream of becoming a star... loved by all. Will you come with me? - Where to? - To open the door. I called you all night. Where were you? No√©mie! Muriel... No√©mie, my sister-in-law. I'm in love. - Really? - With whom? It's just a hypothesis for now. Are you sleeping here too? I was worried sick after your call. Can I have a word? You're so suspicious. The spitting image of Hans! I always disliked your family's fear of strangers. Yeah, but you trust anyone! She's a friend from singing class. That smell... Are you hiding something? Remember how your brother said I spoke too much... So, I've decided to be quiet But you always said I was the sister you never had. Open up to me. Trust me. You'll feel a lot lighter. - Well, I'm off. - No, come here. Join us. You're my friend, she's my sister-in-law. She wants to know what you do. I work in cargo. That's not sexy. But I work on the ground. Let's drink champagne and talk about boys all night! Have you been deceived recently? - Is being in love a deception? - If it's a young man, yes. - How did you know? - You're the type. Be careful. Youth wants to consume and consume immediately, but it has nothing to do with love. I have some very bad news. We've lost two of our students this week. Violently... and for no apparent reason. Xavier was strangled in Paris. And Anna's body was found floating near a lock in Rouen. I also have an announcement. Opera is not me. It's not my thing. I want to sing pop. I want to sing love songs! I only chose opera so people would take me seriously because of Hans who was a music-lover and a frustrated pianist. But he was a virtuous banker despite what the press said about him. Listen, Hans, wherever you might be, I accept my corny side. Anna's death opened my eyes and I think you all should do some soul-searching. It's a pity. You underestimate yourself. Stop bursting everyone's bubbles! I know someone in radio. He knows everyone. I did "Pop Ac". - Pop what? - You know, "Pop Academy". I didn't last very long. I got eliminated the first week. You know... the world of pop is tough, but I know lots of people. I thought you hated me. I never said that I hated you. Precisely. It's me. I broke open my piggy bank. I'd like to see you again. Actually, I'd like to take an unlimited plan. The problem is you make me feel good and that's not what I want. The breakfast was repulsive as usual. They refuse to pay business class. The hair belongs to a certain Reza Ahmed Jamshid, known by our services. He has 3 passports: Iranian, French and Italian. And a Green Card. We didn't know he was in Paris. He's in charge of shipping merchandise to the Persian Gulf. All our fellow agents are after him. If you see him, eliminate him. No questions asked. No singing exercises or opera. How did you find the hair? I took a specimen from the young recruit's bed. The male whore. That's why you seem so tortured. You slept with him too? I want to be transferred. Are you serious? Why didn't you tell me? You can't! I decide who leaves and who doesn't. Did I do something that deserves punishment? Let's finish... and you can continue your lover's quarrel later. We work for French Intelligence. You've heard of nuclear terrorism? Even the weatherman talks about it. This threat is hovering over your class. Constance Muller is the rogue network's prime focus because of her husband. Take my word. Your new students didn't fall out of the sky. They come for Constance, not you. She is innocent. - We never said she wasn't. - Not guilty doesn't mean innocent. She can't stop her lessons. You must teach her pop. We must find what we need. As long as I live, I'll never teach pop. You can call Constance, dear. I won't go against my principles. I just realized something about all the students. They all come from Dr. Muller. I've never made the first move. I hate it! That's often the case between men and women. You have to put your pride aside at your age. I'm 29, is that old? Yes, it's too old to start over. I feel young. You're wrong. Look. You think those wrinkles are a sign of youth! So why did she accept dinner? Because some of us like old men. Look at her as if she were the most beautiful woman. She's so insecure, so stupid. That's how people used to look at me. Who's going to look at me now? I'll always be here to look at you. Good evening. Good evening. How do you find me? What exactly do you mean, miss? I feel ugly and heavy. No, you're beautiful and light. You have the face of a little girl. Because I've yet to know the joys and pains of maternity. - Where is he? - You're very impatient. Do as I do. He'll eventually come, take his key and go to his room. If you don't know what time he's due back, shut up. Sorry, this place puts me in a bad mood. Don't tell him I came. I'll look like a beggar. No, wait. I shouldn't, but here. Wait for him. He loves that. I didn't know the Iranian was in the room! - Who do you work for? - The hotel. I've been here 20 years. Check my pay stubs! Now "hey"... Your cords are pink and pearly. Lovely. What's your flaw? I can tell by reading your cords. It's a question of... It's not very clear with you. You are... Why do you sing? I love your sister-in-law. Everyone loves her. If you want to search, be my guest. It's not here nor there. Why are you getting mad? Are you hiding something? My work is to uncover things, isn't it? There you go. You can continue your singing classes. Fifty drops, three times a day. My personal elixir. You look like a child. Preserve it. If you're careful, your eyes won't age. It's your charm. I'm not afraid of ageing. Liar. Love is crazy It gives tenderly Then takes back greedily Love is crazy Poor souls are we Begging down on our knees It pretends not to see... You think your friend at the radio will like it? It's fabulous. It's so simple. So clear. Straight to the heart. You're so talented. I would never be able to say things so sincerely. It's obvious, he's guilty. Can I come in? I'm depressed. I almost got killed. I've thought it over. I love you. You're saying that so I'll let you in. I'm quitting. I don't want to be a team. In that case, get information on the sister-in-law. The problem is you make me weak. Whenever you're here, I succumb to you. Is that for real? A Steinway. - Can I touch it? - Show me your fingers. The other side. Okay, go ahead. - Do you want whisky or vodka? - Either. What are you doing? Do you think I'm handsome? Want to see me get hard? Yes... I haven't seen this in a long time! I'm warning you, I'm only looking. You're not going to ejaculate? Yeah, that way we can go to sleep. - Here. Removes everything. - Your creams are bullshit. I'm waiting impatiently for wrinkles. Stop singing. It's like nails on a blackboard! Can I have some privacy? Treating me like a kid won't get me hard! Your back needs a little soaping. My back is higher up. It's not my fault. Your skin drives me wild. I want to eat it. His trunk was empty. The buyers used fake IDs for the sale. They paid with freshly printed bills from Germany. Shit. The car is polluted. Why won't you make love with me? Why can't I give you a hard-on? - My dick's not the centre of the world. - And hold my hand? I'm always the one in need. I'm always the dog coming for its bone. There's uranium on the hood. You always find an excuse not to answer me. I always screw things up because I'm clumsy. But I dream that people look at me and find me pretty. Go on, take samples. For samples, I need to scratch it with something. How about my nail file? Thank you. Looking for something? I'm such a loser. Sorry, sorry, sorry... I don't know what you want, but there's only me here. Whatever happens, please know I didn't want any of this. Your songs deeply penetrate my heart and soul. Sorry. No, that won't do. Moving around like that! No! I want a clear-cut voice and I want to see your eyes. Stop hassling her. It's good. She learned speech therapy in Berlin. Her lover dealt in radioactive waste from radiologists. Sis-in-law, hairy man, and Julien are a team. If I haven't heard from him... If he hasn't answered my calls... - It means he's with a girl. - Or a boy. A girl. The target. Muriel! Come in, I'm not alone. Then, I'll go. No! Wait till you hear this. Things are starting to look up! Wait. I'll be right back. Why are you so aggressive? That hurts! The widow and my whore are lovers. I saw him suck Nutella off her feet. I'm sure she doesn't pay. I'm always the one who has to pay! Does that help? Why would you care? Are you jealous? You're jealous? Stop your interrogation. I'm already ashamed enough. I'm addicted. I dream about him. Really? You're pathetic. Yeah, I know. What are they waiting for to transfer you? You're hurting my head. I have a headache too. I'm gonna lie down. No more sports. That jerk got me off track. We have to get centred. I've been messing up. I haven't had my period since... Maybe I'm pregnant. Who's the father? Who cares whose dick it was! Pull yourself together. What kind of world are we creating for our children? What do you mean "our children"? It's a generic term. We haven't had sex yet, but the foreplay is so long and delicious. What is love? Enough already. I can't stay in this country. You have 24 hours or we'll get her, bring her to the airport, question her on the plane, then throw her out. How can you prefer her over me? You said a woman's intelligence counted most for you. You're betraying everyone because of that perverted bitch who killed my brother. Are you both totally incapable? You didn't realize a new agent had infiltrated the class? An inoffensive looking Frenchman. You have to get rid of him. Same as for the radiologist. No questions. Just kill him. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? I can't live without you. I can't live far from you. You can't just throw yourself at me. Dammit, we have work to do. This might sound stupid, but I think I love you. Where does that get you? Is it because I didn't get my period? As soon as a woman becomes a potential mother, you desire her? - I never thought of that. - You might not be the father. You decide who the father will be. No, come back. Bring your radiation detector. I need it. I can't finish this mission without you! I was thinking of you. Your life is in danger! You have to disappear! Your husband hid information that people would kill for. Run away. I'll go with you. I have lots of money. I have enough for you and me. If I gave you the USB, you wouldn't love me anymore. Come to singing class! You're the first person I've ever loved. I don't want to lose you. Really? Really? He'll never make it out alive. Sorry. I wanted you to know that I'm a whore. But I promise to change. I also have something to say. Mum, I'm leaving and stopping singing. Otherwise, I'll grow old only knowing this apartment. If you go, I'll die. I also have something to say. I'm pregnant. I can tell. That's the miracle of singing. Your body was dormant. Whose baby is it? Not yours. You're incapable of giving life. But if there's a father, he's here. You've all been an inspiration for me. I recorded my song... I brought it to the "Young Talent" contest at Radio France. They thought I was a bit mature, but they seem interested. I think they like it. Move and she's dead. Get up. Give us what we want or else! Fat bastard. She doesn't have it. Move. I can't go in my condition, I'll manage here. It's funny how when faced with danger, people reveal themselves. I'm not afraid at all now. After this ordeal, I'll be ready to face any audience. You're so young with such a beautiful voice. How can you kill so nonchalantly? Shut up! I don't like the sound of your voice! If you want to keep your cords, shut up! Help! Police! Help! Start the car! Don't worry. Nothing will happen to Constance as long they don't find the information. This is what you're looking for. Everyone's looking for it. Why didn't you hand it over? It would've prevented deaths. It helped my mum get students. Constance said to hand it over only if she was in danger. Give it to me. I don't want her to die. She has a career in front of her. Why are you so hostile? Give it to me. Give it to me, please. Joseph, look in my bag and get my handcuffs. Everyone's forgotten me You'll never find the USB... I'm sorry. I betrayed you but I didn't want this. Trust me. Listen to me. Give me the key and I'll get you out of here. I'm not afraid. Do whatever you must. It's Julien, what do I say? Why did you bring him? I only wanted to see you two. He's part of the operation. We're going to make an exchange. We've tampered the data on the key. This is the original. Easy... We'll let the embassies take care of it. Don't touch the radiologist and let the voice doctor go. It's been arranged. Non-negotiable. Don't get overzealous, it could work against you. Who is the father? One investigation at a time. They're waiting near the Tuileries. Promise you'll protect Constance. Stop whining, try to act your age. You would've gotten bored of me, found me old, replaceable. She looks at me like I was eternally beautiful. I also thought so for a second. It's my job, doll-face. You could've realized it but you're too sexually self-absorbed. Sorry, I know you prefer gentleness. You know what Hans said about you? That he married a beautiful, gullible idiot. You just sat there and looked pretty. The key! Constance first! How do we know it's the right key? Stop being so suspicious, it does you no good. You have the soul of a prince. I had another dream but I love who you are. You promised me! Never stop singing. You're so beautiful. What about the radiologist? Let him run. We'll take care of him in 9 months. Our "Young Talent" of the week! She may not be 18, but she's my top choice! Constance. A magical name. - What are you going to sing? - "Love is Crazy". Take the microphone. "Love is Crazy". Yes, Constance. Love is crazy. You're so soft. No one's ever said that to me. Not even my mother. You're the first woman who insisted to have me. Usually women think I'm just a kid. Not me. Really? You won't change your mind? You and your doubts. You and your questions. I won't be afraid to age with you. But what a bore!
