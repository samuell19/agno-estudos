London, 1950. The crime wave was at it's height. Armed robbery, house breaking, smash-and-grab raids. The police was powerless... overwhelmed by the new gangs that seem to spring up every day. One of the gangs was led by a certain George Brain... known to himself as "The great brain". Right, we're go over the setup once more. There's the bank, there's the High Street. Yeah, remember, those doors are shut at three o'clock prompt... so everything depends on split-second timing. You've only got to do what you've been told and all will be a piece of cake. Right, now I want to be dead sure whether you know what you are doing... Booky? I take up my position here at seven minutes to three. When you arrive I cut the telephone wires to the bank. Right. Then you follow me straight in. And while I am turning to the cashier, you get ready to blow the strong room door. - Right. - Dipper! I park the getaway car across the street six minutes to three here... and when you arrive, I dump the burglar alarm bell on the wall there. - Right. Myrtle! - Four minutes to three exactly I drop you outside the bank, George. - Right. Then you come straight back here and wait for us. That's it, then. Now remember. No slip-ups. No mistakes. Good luck! Tomorrow... that's the day. This is the big job! Hold that. - Hey you! - Eh? - What do you think you are doing? - Broke our window. - Yes, I know. - Clump you! - Yes, I am sorry, sir. - That's no excuse! - No, sure, sir. I will pay for the window, sir. Leave that! Leave that! Get the strong room door open! Stop that! - What the hell is that? - Open that door! - Wilson, take me here! - We had it! - Open me! - We had it! It was opened!. Yes, get out of here. Get out, prompt. - Wilson, open the door. Will you let me in?! Get the money! Call the police. Don't, never mind. I'll get them myself. Right, ready to get out of here. George, George, the police are coming! Right. Let's go. Thanks a lot. - What on earth do you think you are doing? - I wanted to warn you about coming of the police. - All right. Calm down. Get into the car and try to look like everything is natural. Don't you stare! Come on! I'm stuck! Come on, pull! Pull! Pull! Drive slowly, twit! When did you ever see when these things were going fast? - Oh, yes, I am sorry, George. I forgot. - Hey George, and we better hide that somewhere? Yes, we'd better! Where did you get this hearse scrump? Place of a mortuary, why? - There's someone in it. - Well, don't worry, George. He won't talk. They went that way, in a hearse! Ah, here they are, at last. Don't know now, but I think we are being followed. - And who are they? - How do I know who they are? Probably the friends of this. - Well, how we can get away from them? Taking with the blooming creeps. - We don't want to get away from them. - Now we'd look like a proper funeral, ah? - May be, but we can't go like this for long. Sooner or later they are gonna want to stop somewhere and... you know... him. Listen! The cops! - Are they onto us? - I don't know yet. Just keep going slow, take the first turning and we'll soon find out. They go onto us! Get on it! Come on, come on, go on, let us gain on them. Come on! They are gaining on it! Are not you tired of going around? Get on for a straight piece of road! - Good work, we've lost them! - Ah! - We may have lost them, but there are more in front of us! - Huh?! You twit, that is the same one! Stop it! Run for it! Scarper! - Come on. - Damn it! Get out! Ah!! Since you're persisting in your refusal to tell the court where you have concealed the proceeds of this dastardly robbery I have no alternative but to pass the maximum permissible sentence. You will all serve 15 years of hard labour. - 15 years! You're joking! I won't go! - No me! I'll be outside in a week! The lock that can hold me has not been invented yet! I will be outside in a week, you hear! Won't wait! Won't wait! - Well, as a long as week I have expected. - Well, it was not my fault. I'd make it easy if they'd not take my tools away. -You know, I can pick any lock. - You couldn't pick your own tooth. - Ah! Free! Free at last! - George! Oh, George! - I told you she will be here to meet you, George. - George! - Oh, George! - Wait! Wait! It's enough! All right. It's enough! - Oh, George! - Get off! Get off! - It was such a long time! - You don't need to tell me that! - George, did you get the file I sent you in the cake? Did you miss me, George? Oh, did you miss me? - Yes, my dear, I missed you! Yes, I did. Now, come on, we must turn to work! - Turn to work? You not... You not going straight? - Of course I am not going straight! Cor blimey, she wouldn't dream to think the worst of me. - Now, he means we got to go and get the money of that tree. - Yes, that's right now! - Right away? - Sure dear, right away. - But you just... I thought me and you could make a bit of fun, you know. Make up a lost time. Myrtle, you know what we always said: the big job comes first! - Nothing will stand in it's way. Nothing! - But you've been saying that since I have met you. I have enough stuff in my bottom drawer to order a jumble sale. What a great idea! My lovely, what a great idea! We could do with a cash, could we? - Could get me a new clothes. Somebody to keep me tonight. - Well... George, I... I've been getting the old flat ready, you know... For us. - What a lovely girl she is, eh! What a lovely girl you are! Lead us to it. - Well... Actually I meant it just for... you and me! - You don't think that I would desert my mates, do you? - Oh George! - Then it's done? - Oh! - And where is the tree? - Across that hill there. And then across that road. And two hundred yards along that footpath there... "Lovers walk". Fair enough. But how we can get the money without being noticed. But why would they call it "Lovers walks"? - George and me never did much walking. - What would you expect to be called then? Lovers sit-downs. Hey, you know what I mean. - Night is the best time. Do it when nobody is watching. - You don't have to tell us that. No, what is the best time to get the money of the tree? You don't want to worry about that. It's all over the open country here. There was not any house for miles. - What are we waiting for then? - Let's go now. - Oh George, we're not going yet! - That's right, darling. You are gonna get up and you find a car and then you drive us right there. - Oh George! - Right. Yes, you might need it. - I thought you would give us all the celebration? That's my girl. - Where did you knock the car off like that? - I did not knock it off. I've hired it. - You shouldn't have done that. - Oh, it's all right. I paid them with a dummy cheque. That's my girl. Look, that's the bank! - Has not changed much as it is. - Oh, I don't know. They've mended the window. - Funny you did remember the place, funny, isn't it? - Yeah, isn't it? You know what we must do with the dough? - What? We may get off money with bank in there. Ah ! This is where we stopped. This is it! You stopped at that hill. - Fifty thousand quid! - It was worth to stretch every year of it! - Come on it! George, wait for me! What's happened? That wasn't there before! Are you sure we've come to the right place, George? But of course it is the right place! It was all country down there! Where's "Lovers Walk"? And a tree? - What's the matter? - Look at that! Oh, new town! How lovely! - Lovely? - Look at these pretty little houses. - Just suit us, Georgie, one of them. - Myrtle, one of them pretty little houses has been built right over my pretty little flipping tree. - Yes, but what they would build the town here for? - It's the houses shortage. I was reading about it inside. - In the last ten years the population in the cities is increased by... - If I hear one more word about what you've read inside I'll flick your cake over that! Don't take it on me, George. I didn't build the town! Georgie, just cause they've built them houses, it doesn't mean they cut down the trees. - That's right, George. Look, there's one sticking about the roofs over there. - Look, is that it, George? It could be! It could be! It can be the right place! Get into the car! Prompt! Look! There's "Lovers Walk"! Blimey, it is! Come here, Myrtle! It's the tree! Coming of the wall up! - Here it is? - Come on, let's have a look. Come in, sit down. - Hold me. Let's have a look! - Up! Up! Up! Up! Up! It is! Ha-ha! It's my tree! Oh George! ... George, you alright? Yes, yes, I'm fine. - Luckily me face brought me for. - Oh, you ought to be careful, dear. Don't you spoil your looks. - What more can you do to that face? - Shoudn't we go? - Go? Go where? - In there. To get the money. You did say it's your tree, George, didn't you? - And how you propose we get it, genius? - Oh, don't be silly, George. Show me the house I can't get into if I want to. Well, look at him! Saint of the saint! - You want all of us go away again to the penitentiary! - Oh, we got to get in somehow, George! - I know that. But we got to get in legitimately. - Like we come to read the gas meter or something. - They got no gas meters in tree! - I said something like that. - What about me being abrought for insurance agency? - What is that got to do with trees? - He could say he were branch manager. Hysterical. Could you much shutting up and let me think of something. What with this plan? Should you say you was a cop investigating robbery and you thought the money was hidden in that tree? - Myrtle, would you mind keeping quiet and let me think. - Sorry, George. That's what we do. We say we are coppers investigating a robbery. - That's brilliant, George and we think they've hidden the money in the tree. - Shut up! And we think they've hidden the money in the tree. - That's a good idea. - I told you I'll think of something, didn't I? You stay with Myrtle, you come with me. He's a genius, isn't he! - Blimey, look! - Let's clear out of here! - Something new happening? - Oh, you must be joking. I've never known there is a town with so many honest people in. Blooming disgusting, it is. Oh, and I joined the police for a bit of action. And look what I had since I've been in: one drunk and incapable, a lost cat and a Peeping Tom. And the Peeping Tom turned out to be the drunk looking for his pussycat. You know I don't mind it at all, my son. - Now, where I've put the notes for my concert part? I must get that baritone part right before the rest of the night. - Well, it's not just now good enough, Sergeant. You know, I was on the phone to Winsham just now. And they've got bags of excitement. - Like "Z Cars" it is over there. - Ah, really? Ah! Here it is! Seems they had a big bank robbery over there some fifteen years ago. Fifty thousand never recovered. And a gang that did the job - they were released this morning. They put a plainclothes men in order to follow them but they gave them a slip. They would have led them to the money... They were caught somewhere around here, you know. That was before the town was build up, of course. Yes Sergeant, I would be not at all surprised if that money was also hidden somewhere around here. My! I've got much of it! - Why, do you think so,Sergeant? - But of course... they shouldn't be going bom, bom, boooom! They should be going booom, booom, boooom. - You've got the difference? - Yes, sir. Would you believe? Would you believe?! Right in middle of the backyard of the flipping chokey! The one place we can't legitimately go into. Why? I don't see why not? We haven't done anything wrong. - It's our money and only we stole it, we. - Ah, you're right. You're absolutely right. All you've got to do is go in there and say: "Excuse me, sarge," "but fifteen years ago we happen to have left fifty thousand nicker in your tree". Can we have it back, please? Hey, it's a marvelous idea, George! I think it would work. Surely, it will work. They probably will give you fifteen years interest on it as well. - Hey, let's go there. - Come back hey you! Can't you get it into your thick bonce they will want that money back. That they will be looking out for us. - Oh George, it is... - George is right, Dipper. Why don't you forget it, Georgie? After all money isn't everything. I'll think about it for a while. Something will turn up, you'll see. What have I said you?! Look at that! - What? - There! Look at that house, in the window. "Rooms To Let." - And it's right opposite the copper factory. - Myrtle, go and get four rooms from tonight. - Four, Georgie? Oh, naturally. This is respectable neighborhood. There is a pub around the corner. Meet us there. - Yes? - Did you have some rooms to let? I don't. Mother does. But she's out. Perhaps I could speak to your father? Oh, if you're psychic. He is dead. That's why she's letting rooms. - Sad it is, isn't it? - Yes. Well, I have... I was looking for accommodation for myself and three gentlemen. Oh, there are only two doubles going. You'll have to share. Oh, I did... Oh, I don't know, I think... perhaps we could manage with two doubles. - Yes, well, you could sort it all out with mum. She will be back about six. - Thank you. You're welcome. Until aft... - I still don't see how it can help us even if she does get these rooms, George? - Well, we'll be able to keep an eye on them from rooms there. And wrap on the country right on the spot. Hey, that's a thought. - We couldn't handle it all, George if you hadn't been here. - Well, I can't ken what you would do without me. - One thing sure, we wouldn't be sitting here and planning the break to police station. Hello Myrtle! - So what? - Oh, she said... She said they've got two double rooms, George. - It's my lucky day, I'm feeling, come on, then. - There is only one thing... - Yes? - I have said we were married. - Well, it doesn't matter. - You have said what? - I had to tell we were married. - Oh, she's... a widow, you see, very respectable and,... well, she asked. - But we're not yet married. We were not married, aren't we? - Oh, we could be! And... well, seize that two double rooms we're after, we would, wouldn't we? - This is like you are caught this time, George. - Shut up! Look Myrtle, but we can't this moment get married. Just like that. Oh, we can! I've made enquiries. There is a registry office near. It is open to six. It is anyway half past five now. But Myrtle, you must be reasonable, Blimey, I mean carrying splite isn't as easy as all that. We even have no ring. - Oh, don't worry, George. I'll find you one. - Sit down! - I'm not staying in sin and that's flat. - Have I ever asked you to stay anywhere in sin? Flat or otherwise? That's right, isn't it, George? It's too much at stake to take any chances. The least you can do it put up a respectable front. If you don't belt up, you'll get my respectable boot up your this respectable... backside. But think of all the money that's waiting for us, George. I don't care about that! I am a romantic type. And when I am going get clobbered me for life, it will be when I say. Right! Well, I'm going tell them we don't want the rooms because... my husband wouldn't marry me! George, remember what you said: "Job comes first. Nothing will stand in it's way." Nothing! You call this nothing? I won't do it, man! Never! Never! - Do you, Myrtle Robbins, take George Brain to be your lawfully wedded husband? - Oh yes, I do! - And you, George Brain, take Myrtle Robbins to be your lawfully wedded wife? - Yes, I suppose so. - I do. - I said I did, didn't I? - George! - I do now pronounce you man and wife. - Oh George! Oh, alright, alright! You haven't heard the last of this. I shall appeal! Would you mind?! Oh, that's you! Come in. - Take off your hat. - Mummy's not back yet. But I'll show you the rooms. Is that the respectable widow you were telling me about? - Oh, don't be silly, George. She has a daughter. - I think I'm gonna like it here. Well, are you coming? Oh yes, right there. - Get up. What's happened to you. I'm sure you could see the good looking girl like that before. - Yes, but not could looking at that behind. In here. This is the best one. The other is in the back. - Not much of a view. - No. Don't you believe it. - That's a sweetest view I ever saw! - Some I think are very easy to please. Firstly, I think it is dreary. Here comes mama. I'll tell her you're here. Come in! Come here! Look at that! - Must say it's a perfect observation point. - It's great, isn't it! - Yeah! - You can see the hole over there. You can see even what they are doing in a chokey. George, doesn't it get worthy get marry on me? - Yes, we got it worth here. Did you give them your real name when you first came in? - Oh, she never asked me. - Good, good, we have to use false ones. - False ones? Oh! What was the point of us getting married? - Now she asks me! - George is right, Myrtle. We can't use our own names. It's too risky. Surely. We will use ours classy ones that we had for the Metropole Hotel job. - Oh, there you are! How do you do? I am Mrs Gamely. - How do you do Mrs Gamely? I'm Professor Hook. - Dr Line, Mr Sinker. - How do you do? Ah, I don't know what my daughter tell you, but I charge eight guineas a week full board. Lunch optional, breakfast sharp at eight, supper at seven. No pets, children, all musical instruments. A shilling per a bath. And all guests will be provided their own soap, towels and toilet paper. Payments in advance. Of course Mrs Gamely. Mr Sinker, my cheque book please. Any particular bank at all, George? Oh, there is no hurry, professor. This evening will do. Well, I do hope that you all will feel comfortable here. I am sure we will. Afraid, but I have only got two double rooms, sir. The young lady have to share with one of you then. Don't you worry about that. Those two will have one room. And me and my wife will have the other. Are you married?... Oh, I didn't know. - George, I'll... I'll just go to have a look at another room. - No! Wait, wait! What do you think of that? What about of that double quacking? - What do you clucking at that? - All that trouble for nothing. - Oh, shut up! - Good evening. - Hello. Thank you for coming. Be comfortable. - Thank you. - Not that place, doctor. That's my poor dear husband's place. - Oh, sorry. - I thought he was dead. - He is. - Well, why wouldn't you sit next to me, doctor? - Oh, all right. We single ones must get together, mustn't we, doctor? - You are single, aren't you? - Oh, yes, dear lady. - There is only one of me. - Well, I must say this looks very good scoff, Mrs G. [Yes, there is no so long queue, too.] Whatever, we got it. What brings you to Oldfield, professor? Research of some kind? Eh yeah, that's right. We are researchers. How exciting! What are you interested in? - Birds. - Oh, he means [studying how they fly], of course. - How interesting! Must be very exciting work, doctor? - Oh, yes, it is. The study of birds and their habits is quite fascinating, Mrs Gamely. I have always been reading about it in stir... Sir Benjamin Stir, I mean, he's the leading author on the subject, you know. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, yeah. - For instance, eh, did you know there are some species of birds that are now practically extinct. - Really? Now, you take the little bustard... Now, it seems that fifty years ago the southern part of England was overrun with little bustards. Now... you are never seeing them. Big bustards, maybe... but not little bustards. How amazing! Sugar? - Oh!... Eh... Can I... Can I get you another one? - No, please don't. I like tea in my food. - Sally! That's enough. Not embarassing Mr Sinker. Do go on with what you are saying, doctor. Well, I don't know much more about birds... But some very interesting things about fish. - Really? Oh, do tell us. - Oh yes. For instance... There is the fish of the Huss family, who's habit, it is, when hungry, to eat itself. Starting with it's tail and working up. - Gracious me! Amazing! - Yes. It's now is known as a short huss. Now this short huss... Good evening, Mrs G! - We've been shopped. - Oh Harold, we were waiting for you. Here, I'll present you our new guests. This is Professor and Mrs Hook. Mr Sinker and Dr Line here. - How do you do. - How do you do. Harold is a policeman. Is he? Could have fooled me. He's been with us for an year, aren't you, dear? That's right, it's nice and handy to live near the police station. Doctor? Now, did I say something wrong? Oh no, no. It's just the sight of uniform. For him it's always upsetting. - Ah, poor Dr Line. Do you know my dear husband was just the same. - Well, I am sorry about that. - And how is my beautiful girl tonight? - I am not your beautiful girl. - I don't see to be very popular around here. - I could say that again. - What was that? - I said: "It looks like rain". - Oh yes, wow, we get great rains in this area this time of year. And where are you from, Mr Sinker? - Me? Oh, Scrubs. - Scrubs? - Eh, Scrubs Birds Society. That's a Red Corners. The jail birds, I suppose. How funny is you mention "The Scrubs", because the boys of the Winsham, they were telling me they are looking for a gang which was released from there only this morning. In a way. Some [bragging] smalltimer, who called himself "The Great Brain". They seem they did the big bank job over there some years ago. [and from what I've heard they've run amok upon it.] What do you mean? It was a brilliant job. That thing with those funeral cars. - Cor, we have to go. We've got work to do. - But you have not finished your supper! - I've had enough, thank you. - But what is that? She had not ate her pudding! - She's ate enough as well. Come on! - Another of your talk and I will get me an ulcers. - What? Do you think he suspects something? - What with your big mouth! - What's wrong with what I said? - Oh, it's no use! Come on! Come after me! Oh, by the way, Sal, I won't be able to take you out this evening. - Oh, that's a promise? - No, you see, I am at the desk again tonight and there's a constabulary rehearsal at half past seven. - That should be fun. - Oh, it is! Sergeant's giving me a solo at this time. ♪ When constabulary duties to be done, to be done. A policeman's lot is not an 'appy one. - Happy one! ♪ : Gilbert & Sullivan opera "Pirates of Penzance" (1879) Half eleven... Don't they ever give up? No, stop looking so miserable. That cop, he didn't suspect a thing. - I'm not worried about that. Just that I'm... so ashamed. - Ashamed? Yes. When I think I'm sleeping under the same roof with a copper... eating at the same table, using the same washbasin, I... I feel downright soiled. - Ah, shut up! - And what about you then? - What about me then? Sitting there, conversing with him, like you with him are socially equal! Don't you talk to be about conversing me! You and your little bustard. And I taste a bit of sourness in your smalltalk about that fish dissapearing up it's own cakehole. - Those happen to be scientific facts! - Get out of it. - Hi George. Look at that! Quick! Take it there and put by the window. Good boy!... Here. Here. Put it on here... Here, put up on that. Good. That's it. There we are. There. Yeah. Now, that is what I call a telescope! - Where did you get it? - It's in the park on the hill. - Oh, we can really have a good close-up on that yard now. But what's the matter with it? I can't see a thing. - Oh, you have to put a tenner here. - What tenner? - Oh, this woudn't work if you don't put tenner in. Do you mean that you tell me that we got to pay to look through our own blooming telescope? - What, it's not exactly ours, I've stolen it. - Give me a tenner. - Right. - Where's a gap? - In here. Ah, here he is. Sir Malcolm, Sergeant. Here she is. My little beauty. I can see the hole I have put the stock in it. - Is that's all I have got for a tenner? - Oh, that's all right, George. I've got another one. - At this rate, mate, it will cost us all our money just to keep watching it. - George! - Yeah, what? - Come to bed now. - Bed, what for? - It's getting late. - I'll be daft if I'll go to bed now. I have a work to do. Look at that, now you've made me waste a tenner. - I'm sorry. It is our wedding night. - I know that. But what about it? - Oh, you know... - It's usual... to be for get married... - Yeah, but it's not a usual married, is it? I mean was condemned to it. That's stabbing you, George? Everyone is. You keep out of this! - I am sorry. But for your spouse it's the marriage of convenience. - Oh! Oh, would it be convenient if you come to bed now? - No, it wouldn't. Would you buzz off and leave me alone? Go on. Pass. - Oh, oh! You shouldn't treat her like that, George. It's not nice. - At what are you laughing, poodle? - I didn't say it wasn't funny. I said it wasn't nice. She loves you, George. - I know that. And I love her, so what? - Nothing. You should somehow show it. - Women! Who is it? - Only me. - What do you want? Oh, I am sorry, sweetheart. All what I'm thinking now is... but how can I this money, I mean... get out? - It's alright, George. You're right, anywhere. I did trick you into it. - So what? I would not have it any other way? It's not the same working without us getting married sometime, is it? - I just wanted to speed things up a bit. - Certainly, it's a best way, isn't it? I mean getting it out quick like going to dentist. - You're not... angry with me then? - Oh no, of course not. - Nice room, isn't it? - Not bad, not bad at all. Look at that... lovely comfy bed. Yes, great. It's spacey. You could have a really good kip in this. - Night, night. - Where are you going? - Back to the other room. - But... you will come back later? - Oh, yes, of course. And don't worry, I won't wake you. - Hey, Booky... - What is it? [I've missed this so in the nick.] Yeah, oh, yes, it's lovely. Oh, not now! - So, what's cracking? - Wait, George. Hey, go look at that. Well, what would I look at that for? Ah, no. A ladder! That is what we need! - She's got a good and great ladder! - Oh really? - I don't know. I stared only at her legs. - But it's a leggy one indeed! Handy to climb up! What about it? - We gonna need somebody to get out over the wall, aren't we? - Yes. Well, can you think of anything better than the ladder? - Hey, it's marvellous, George! Isn't it, Booky? - What? - George's thought to use the ladder to get over the wall. Amazing!... I don't know what we would be doing without that inventive mind of his? - Thank you. Now, go and liberate the ladder. - Ah, all right. - You're alright, Dottie? - Yes, Ernest. - Oh, I've forgotten to leave the note! - Oh, haven't looked. You get in the car. I'll take that. Dot!... Dottie! - Did you get it? - Yes, in front garden. - Good! Come in. This is what we do. As soon as they stop blowing and it turns still over there, we move in. They will leave only one man on duty and he's bound to fall asleep. Shh! Listen! - What? - Do you hear it? - No. Me neither now. Well, it's a bright conversation, I must say. We talk about the singing, you twit. It stopped. - They've gone. Tenner! - Ah, here it is. - This blooming thing. It will break us. I told you. It's only one man down there. - Let's go. That's it. - What, now? - Now. Shoes off. - Suppose that the nightman sees us. - He won't recognize us, you see. Put the stockings on. Hey George. Give me another one, George. Not on your leg, you dimwit. Put it on your head like this. - Ernest, where are you? - I'm up here. - What are you doing up there? - I can't get down. Someone took the ladder away. - But what it would be done for? - Never mind what they did it for. Get another one! Right! We'll get on the top of that. Pull the ladder above after that. - Then we lower the ladder down on the other side. Right? - Right. Right. Do you mind? Get the ladder up. Someone is coming. Freeze! This someone has pinched the ladder. This is fantastic, isn't it? You can't trust anybody. - What we can do now, George? - Don't worry, don't worry. I'll think of something. I know. - Look, Booky. Look... - That drag feels badly, seems too tight. - Yeah. - But do keep it. - You're the lightest. - Yeah. - We lower you down and you come with the loot. All right. Wait a moment, wait a moment, wait a minute... Right! Shut up! Somebody out there? Now look what you have done! - Who's there? - For Pete's sake, get me out of there! Hey, what do you think you are doing? - George, George, George, wake up. George, George. - Ah, shut up. - Something happening, George. Over there. - What? What? - Somebody is digging there in the tree! Cor blimey! - Give me a tenner, quick. - Here we are. Cor blimey! He's got his hand in the hole! - Has he got the money, George? - No, but he's got his... He had... Damn this flipping thing. No, no, nothing. They have gone. I don't like that. I don't like that at all! - See who that is. - Right... That's alright. That's Myrtle. - You're all right, Georgie? - Yes, yes, I'm all right. - Ah, you didn't come to bed. I was worried. If that's the only thing you've got to worry about, you're lucky. I say... Well, I don't know if you know that, but breakfast scones are gone. I didn't take them, George, honest. I mean, it's rung? Are you coming down? I can't eat, with all that's on my mind. Oh, you should be there. It will be funny if you don't. You're dead right, but... we're left to act like nothing happened last night. Nothing did. - Come on, Dipper. - And what with this copper down there? - All the more reason. Come on. - Oh, I must take a wash. - Come on, Booky. Come on. Get up. - Well... - Breakfast! - What's going on? - Breakfast! - Oh, I don't want any other breakfast. - You got to! They're nervous if you don't. - They're nervous if I do have no trousers! - Morning, Mrs G. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - You'll never guess what happened last night, Mrs G. - Now, what was that there, Harold? - Someone actually tried to break into the station. - Oh, surely not. No, you must have imagined it. - That's just what the sergeant said this morning. But I shook him. Because I've had his trousers off. But why you took the trouble taking the sergeant's trousers off? No, not the sergeant's, Mrs G. The fellow who was trying to break in. I've got him when he was climbing back over the wall. - But it's ridiculous, isn't it? Blimey, what's the need to climb over the wall to enter the police station? - Well, I don't know, ask me... - Unless... - Unless what? They might have been after our sound parts. Because the local Choral Society was very jealous about our luck, you know? Because we're better, you see. - The whole local mob must be pretty diabolical. I mean, to be so jealous, you know. -You're telling me! And there's something surrealistic about what happened the last night. - Some very very rum things were going on up the road at number 18. - At Franklins? Might have guessed... - What happened? Well, it appears that rather far through the night they heard a very funny noise. They got up to investigate and they found their daughter in the front garden with a ladder, trying to get a strange fellow out of her bedroom window! - Really... - You try me to work that out. It beats me. - Oh, you're a bit late nighter, Mr Sinker. - Yes, I'm sorry, Mrs Gamely. I went in the bathroom for a washing and got chatting with your daughter. - Oh, don't tell me Sal has been on her feet at this early hour. - Oh, no! She was in the bath. - Eh... Where's Dr Line? - Oh, he's there still in bed. He's had a bad night. One thing and another. - Ah, poor doctor. I know. I'll take him a nice tray. Well, that's something new! I never knew her to do like that to anyone else before. Oh! By the way, dear. I didn't tell you. I thought I saw a little bustard this morning. - Are you all right, Georgie? - Yes! - I thought I saw it in the big hole in old tree across the road there. - Oh, the one in the station yard. - Ah, was that the police station, eh? - Well, I sincerely hope your little bustard is not nesting in that tree. - Why not? - Because they are cutting it down next week. George!... Oh, you must excuse my husband. He's very fond... of trees. - What do they want to cut it down for? - They say it's got something in it. - But there is nothing in it! I swear to you. Tell them it's empty! Well, I'm not gonna argue with them, professor. I mean, they are supposed to be the experts. And if they say that it's got a canker in it, that's it. - A what in it? - A canker. - Oh! Well, it's different, isn't it? Who is it? - It's me, doctor. I've brought you the breakfast. - Oh, just a minute, Mrs Gamely. All right, Mrs Gamely, [all is in order, you see]. Here we are then. - Oh, it's very nice of you, Mrs Gamely. Very nice indeed. - Oh, not at all. - When a man has to stay in bed, that's a time we women have our own way, I think. - Oh, I was thinking so, too. I always did it with my late husband, you know. - I'm glad to hear it. - Breakfast in bed all during his last long illness. Now, you sit yourself up. Well, now I would want to see you eat all this up! - I see you need being looking after. - Thank you. - Yes, you know it's ten years now since my dear husband sailed to his last great journey. - Really? Oh, I expect he's got there in heaven and not in hell. - You'd never been married, have you, doctor? - No, no, I'm afraid, not. I'm happy to say. Oh, you must not give up hope. You are still very interesting and attractive man. I have a feeling we are going to be... very close friends. Not too close, I hope, Mrs Gamely. - I'd like you to call me Mildred... - Mildred. I like this better. - Oh, excuse me. Am I interrupting you in something? - Oh no, no. I was just going, professor. I'm hoping to see you later. - What a lucky boy! - Take up all of this. I get now out of here. - What are you worrying about? What's the matter? She fancies you, that's all. - Yes, like an old crow fancies worms. - If you had not come in I'd be eaten up already. - Well, never mind about that. You just be nice to her because we might need her. - You know what I've just heard? - No, what? - They're starting to chop that tree down next week. - What? - There's a canker in there or something. Booky, I have something for you, catch. Hey, trousers! Where did you find it. Oh, in the cupboard on the landing. All right? - Hey, I can't wear these. No turn-ups. - Are you all of a sudden Britain best dressed jail bird. Shove them on! Go on! You go get Myrtle. Go on! - All right. We can't wait anymore. We must be ready to take them in too. - [Seems alright.] - Yeah, you'll button them up after. Come on. Go on. Pull on that. - Oh, doctor! Are you feeling better? - Yes, thank you, Mrs... Mildred. - Yes, we thought that fresh air will do him good. - Oh, it's certainly a lovely day. I think I'd accompany you. - Oh, you shouldn't bother, Mildred. - Oh no, that's a pleasure. I'm just getting things. - Mrs Gamely! - Yes, Harold. - Could you go up for a minute? Oh dearest me, dearest me, what's is it? I can't find me best uniform trousers. They were in the landing cupboard. Cor blimey. Come on. Why, that really should be simple enough. Here is us, here's the wall and here's the tree. Then all what we have got to do, is get us from here... to there. - Well, there is only one thing for it. - Yeah, what. - That. - How many times do I happen to tell you we are not gonna knock down that wall. - It's a police station. They'll get falling about that, sure, all that thing. - Oh, I was not thinking of dynamiting it. - Now, what then? Well, I was reading somewhere how they knock things down in India. There are these elephants, you see. And they flat absolutely anything. - I wish they'd flattened you. - Can you think about better idea? - No, no, but I can't think about worst one. - Firstly, I don't think you've got any idea in your head. You're just a line-shooter. - Line-shooter! - Yes. At shooting a line you're one of... - Shooting a line! That's it! Booky, I love you. Aw, shucks. Yeah mate. That is what I call shooting a line. It will never work. Will you stop saying that! - Well, it won't! - It will, Booky. This thing will hit a whale at 500 yards in v-turn. - Listen, Moby Dick. It's crazy, I tell you. Well, we'll see. We'll fire that. - Nearly twelve. Which one is going? - Not me. You're not going fire me on the end of that thing. We don't fire you. We fire the rope. Then you slide down on this thing. It's another tune, isn't it? - Well, why don't you go then? - Because somebody with sense is going to stay up here and do the difficult part... pulling you up again afterwards. - George is right, you know. It could be a tricky job, right, George? - That's a good boy! - Who is it? - It's me, Myrtle. - What's the matter? - Nothing is the matter, George. - Only to ask you when you're coming to bed? - Bed? Why, I thought it's something important. - It is important! - It's not every day you get married. - But we didn't get married today. We got married yesterday. - No, it might be even tomorrow. What's the difference that made? - Myrtle, this is the big job and the big job comes first, you know that! - Heyya, what's that? - Whatever you want to say, forget it. Anybody will think you've never seen harpoon gun before. - For what purpose is it used? - This thing is used for catching whales. - Oh! Never been fishing the whales. Which thing is for the worm? - Oh it... Oh, never mind the worms. Come on. Buzz of to bed. We have another things to do. Come on. - Are you coming later, George? - Let's get the money first. Then we'll have plenty of time for all that other nonsense. Nonsense? - Why, if that's a nonsense then what of fishing out of bedroom windows in the middle of the night for whales, what's this? - Get out. Goodbye. Well, let's get cracking. Open the curtains. - Can I fire it, George? - No, you can't. That thing would need an expert hand. - Of course, you have a lot of experience, haven't you, George? - Who won the Scrubs darts cup for 4 years running? - You did. - Well, shut up and don't meddle with it. Here we go. - Double top, George! - Look at that! I told you it would work, isn't it? - Excellent. - There's just one thing now. - Yeah, what? - Shouldn't someone have kept hold at this end of the the rope? - Well, why didn't you come with it before? - Who am I to tell an expert angler what to do? - Why, blimey, I can't think of everything, can I? All right, we'll do it again. And this time we'll get it right. Hang on at that... There! - Now then... Take hold of that in the end of the rope. - All right. - Nice work, George! You've done it again! - Rope is a bit heavy. Turn on that rope. Keep it tight and hold out. - Seems to be holding. Of course it's holding. I tell you that money is as good as in our own pockets. Here. Hang it on. Push it to there. - That's it. Now you hold that thing. - Right. - Right. Fine. Take that. Then take it and tie it down to the end of the bed head. Pull on. Pull on as hard as you can! All right. Come on. Give me a hand to get this cracking. Watch it!... Here! Heyya Booky, see that!... Perfect! - Come on it. Get up and go! - All right. - Hey, I think I'm gonna like it, George. George! - Right! Now, as soon as you get the money... give a couple of jerks on the end of the rope and we'll pull you back. Right? - Right! Here I go! - Booky! Booky! Hey, Booky! - What? What? What? - One of the coppers has found our harpoon and the ropes. - That's it, I am getting out of here. - Wait!... Wait a minute, what are we panicking for? We chopped the ropes so that they will be in their yard, didn't we? See? How can they possibly connect them with us? There, take a look at that. H'm... That's a harpoon, all right! - H'm... Been fired very recently too, I would say. - Oh, that's what I've been trying to tell you. I mean they weren't there last night. - Oh, what we have to do, Sergeant? - Oh, there is only one thing to do. Put the label on them saying where and when they were found and stick them in "The Lost Property". - Oh, and that is all? - Oh, what else do you want me to do? Oh, don't you think it is highly suspicious that this someone tried to break in here the night before last and then last night this. Oh, we have far more important things to worry about than suspicious incidents. Now go home, Harold and have a good rest, there's a good lad. Ah, too keen and that's his trouble. Never made a good policeman. Ah, what was I doing? Oh yes, the baritone part now. That part is here somewhere, let's see it then. - But what is it? What do you want to talk to me about? Can't it wait? - No, it can't! I'm going. - Going! Going where? - I'm leaving here. - I've realized it was a mistake now us getting married. - Mistakes happen to the best of us. - I'm serious, Georgie. - I've thought this all out. - It will be easy to get this marriage annulled. - Annulled? On the ground it was never consum(mat)ed. Are you going nutty? I don't want to walk out on you. Oh, you don't see you're not doing anything else to me? Myrtle, I've told you that I have got this money business in my head. That's just it! You think more about money than you do about me! Don't you see we are wasting so much time? Cor blimey, we have been here only for two days. Look, we're getting on! - I want a home and a family before it's too late. - That's it! Don't you see: that's it! I want the loot for you! Do you think I want my kids to starve with nothing like I did? I want them only be given the best. Their own set of tools, a good fast getaway car. I don't want my kids going in this business. Do you realize what you're saying? I've spent the best years of my life to build a good solid family business. Oh, stop fooling yourself, Georgie. You don't have a penny and not likely to ever have either. You're right. You're dead right. Then I know it from the minute the harpoon stuff went wrong. - I just can't think of another thing. We haven't got a chance. - Oh, don't worry, Georgie. We'll be all right. - Anything if you still love me. - Of course I want you. - Enough to leave here and start a normal life together? - Yeah, right away if you want. - And you won't think about another way to get that money, will you? - What's the use. There is no another way. Glad, you realized that, Georgie. Because I know that from our side there is no more chance for you to get over that wall than to get under it. Under it! Under it! That's it! Why didn't I think of that. We were doing it the wrong way! I love you! - Dipper, Dipper, come on, boy. Get up. Get up. - What's happened? - You've made a bad slide. Get up. Here we are. - Oh, I'm all stiff. - Hey, hey, hey, I can't move my arms, George. - Why, you have to. You can't walk about like that. It looks ridiculous. - Here we are. - Oh, yes, that's better, yes, that's better. - Well, did we get the money, George? - No. But you don't have to worry, I've got a sensational idea. - Oh, no, not again. - Will you shut up and listen? - We're gonna not to worry about getting over that wall anymore. - Why? Because we're going to build a tunnel. Hey, it's a marvellous idea, George. - I think we can do it. - Come on, come on, look about that. Nick some tools: spades, pickaxes, saws, all that what we need. - Well, you leave it to me, George. And don't you worry. We'll fool them this time. I bet no one has ever thought about building a tunnel over the wall before. - No, not over!... Never mind... Now... It's about 70 yards from here, I reckon. So if we'd start as near the window as possible... four, five days, right? I realize that the brilliant mind like yours tends to overlook trifling details, but... - But what? - This is an upstairs room! I realize that. I just wanted to see if you got it too and that's all. Morning, Sergeant. - Hello. Here are you again. Can we make the start on the tree then? - That's the idea. - Is it alright first to bring us tools to here? - Your own tools? There's no other way, is it? No, ha-ha, no. Come on then. - Excuse me, Sergeant. - Oh, no! What is it? - Somebody's pinched our truck. - Oh, no! Not today! We have. It was just standing right outside here. And it's stolen. Well, I am sorry, but I don't know what I can do about it. And I am up to my ears as it is. - But you must be able to do something! - Alright. Alright. Let's get all the particulars down then, shall we? - Here we are, then. With all that harpoons and disappearing trucks we'll be lucky we get this concert on by Christmas. - Is this it? Thank you. - Right! One: name and occupation? - Henry Blobbitt. - Blobbitt! - Blobb... itt. - Tree feller. - Alright Tarzan. - I've got an idea! You know what we mean? - What? - A room downstairs. - Brilliant! - And that's what I call really quick thinking here. I don't know how you do it, George. - Never mind the sarcasm. - What about that room below this next to the dining room? - That is Mrs Gamely's room. - Is it now? - That would be perfect, wouldn't it? - Yes, it would. What do we do? Get her to move out or just dig around that? - Cause her to change rooms, of course. - Oh yes, I'm sure she'd be delighted to do that for you. - I'm not gonna asking to do anything for me. - Now you're talking sense. - You are. - What? Now wait a minute! - I've got them, George. A whole truck of tools. - Good boy! Where are they? - Still in the truck. It is in the lane at the back of the house. - Well, look. Dump the tools in the shed in the back of the garden. - Get rid of the truck. This will only keep all the cops running. - Right! Leave it to me! - Good! Booky! What we need it's the room! Booky! I think it's time you have a nice comfy little chat with Mrs Gamely. ... Booky! - That's all. I think it's about the lot. - Thank heavens for that. Yes. All we need now is a rough sketch map showing the position of the vehicle... all vehicles at the time of the theft. - I have just told you it was right outside here really. - I know that, man, but I can't put down "right outside here really". It's got to be drawn. Now, how many yards was it from the corner? Approximately. Yards? I don't know how many yards! I see. Then we're better go on measure up, aren't we? Little bit of measuring! It was here. Some people think I have got nothing better to do than filling forms. Makes me sick. Well... - Excuse me, Sergeant. - Oh! - Once more it's gone again? - No! - Ah, that's alright then. The tools have. Right... One... - Name and occupation? - Blobbitt... Trees. - Oh, come on! - Oh, please, George, I mind be doing it. - What are you worrying about? You have only ask her to change rooms with her and that's all. She won't mind, she likes you. - Oh, that's what I'm worrying about. - Oh, come on! Morning. Morning. Yes, well, eh, we have no time to stand and chat it all day, excuse us. Thank you. Here, just a minute. - Yes? - Were you ratting it last night? I... beg your pardon? Well, I mean bird watching or whatever you do, I mean. Oh that! Yes well, we're always at it, you know. - I was just wondering if you'd seen anything peculiar... going on. - Oh, peculiar? Oh no, I mean most birds sleep at night, you know, don't they? - Yes. - Well, I wasn't thinking about birds. I just poke you about you've seen someone new with something... funny with an 'arpoon... gun. Harpoon gun? Well... no. I don't think I've ever seen anybody doing anything... funny with a harpoon gun. Have you, doctor? - Eh, no, no. I once saw somebody do something wrong and peculiar with a f-f-feed gun. - Yeah, but not with a harpoon gun! - Oh, no, no, not a ha-ha-ha-harpoon gun. Sorry... - Surely he is onto something. Did you see the look he gave us? - Of course, I saw him. - It was loaded with handcuffs. - One more reason to get it cracking and get out of it. - Morning, Sally. - Oh, it's you. You won't get any breakfast now, you know. It's all finished. - That's all right. We're not hungry. - Just as well. - That was close, wasn't it? - It is. Not quite up to your usual standard, was it? - No, well... Eh... What if you will let me carry it for you, Miss Gamely. After all, we don't want any more accidents, do we? - No. - Well, where do you want it then. - Anywhere. - Anywhere then... What was that? Oh, it's you! - Oh, you won't get any breakfast now. It's all finished. - Oh, you won't get any breakfast now. It's all finished. Yes I know. - Yes, for we have to keep up right time as you know. - Surely we do. - Of course... if Dr Line has been unwell... - Oh, he's feeling much better now. The matter is that he wants to ask you a small favour, don't you, doctor? - No. - Yes, you do. He is a bit shy. Oh, you mustn't be shy with me, doctor. - You know I'll do anything to make you happy while you are here. - Isn't that lucky? Well, now I want you to come to my room, doctor. We will be more cozy in there, eh? - Oh, George! - Go on, go on and get cozy! - I'm terribly sorry. - Oh, it's quite alright, doctor. I don't mind. But we must be careful, you know. We don't want us to be seen, do we? Well, let's sit down, make us comfortable, shall we. - Oh no, no, I'm, I'm quite alright here. Thank you Mrs Gamely. - Oh no. Now, Mildred. Remember? Mildred... - That's better. Now, what's yours? - Oh, it's a little early in the day for me, thank you. - No, your first name, I mean. - Freddy... Frederick. - Frederick... Charming name... - Well... Frederick, what is it that you want to ask me? - Well... it's rather personal. Oh now, I was hoping, it might be. - That's why I've suggested we came in here. - Yes. Worried about our sleeping arrangements. - Oh! - Yes, well, you see, at the moment... you sleep down here and I am up there... and we... I was... wondering if you wouldn't mind changing all that. I'm not quite sure I know what do you mean, Frederick. Would you mind coming into my room tonight? Why... Oh my... Frederick! You see, I'm... I'm not sleeping too well up there. It's... the altitude. I can't stand heights. And we... I was hoping you'd be kind enough to swap over these. - Oh! - It... it wouldn't be for long... just until we got the job, eh... our work finished. - Well, I'm afraid, not, Frederick. I'd... do anything for you, naturally, but... This was my dear husband's room during his last long ilness. - I could not possibly move out of it. Sure you understand. - Yes, of course, Mildred. Of course, if I was to marry again... wouldn't it be quite different? - Naturally. But it's not nice chance it will happen anytime soon. Oh, I don't know. - I'm just waiting for the right man come along, you know? - Yes. - Well, I'll better be off. I mean he wouldn't want to come here and find me, would he? - Calm, Frederick... I mean he knows. - Perhaps it could be you. - Yes, Mildred... Mrs Gamely. - Wait, Frederick. - No. - Frederick, sit down. - Listen. Don't run away from her, you nit, give in. What do you creep along like that for!? - I've just come to tell you I've hidden the tools alright. - Well, that would do a fat lot of good for us if he doesn't pull his finger out! Go upstairs, we can talk there. - I had an obligation. I was helping Sally with washing up. Well, that's right. You keep doing that you'll get clumpy soft hands and you'll go your lovely head soft in. Well, she's really very nice, George. Cause when I've dropped all these dishes she just laughed. Me've got smashing of all that. - Here we are in the shocking trouble and all you have to do is talk about Sally. - Oh, sorry. - You should be! - All we need now is for those fellows to come around here and chop down that tree and we've had it. - Oh, they did come, George. - They what? - This morning. - I can't see 'em. - Well, I expect they've had to go and get them another tools. - You dare to tell me it was their tools, isn't it? - Yes, did I do wrong, George? - You did right, for the first time! - What happened? - What happened!? She chased me around the room, that's what happened. - And I suppose you've been running from her like a flipping electric hare. - Oh, wouldn't you? - I shouldn't have let to lure me like that down that trap! - Never mind that. What about the room? - She refused. - What? Well, it was tricky. You see, I mean it was her husband's room. And she wouldn't dream to move out until she gets married again. So it was useless, you see. And me? Who would dream of marrying a woman like that? What are you laughing at? George, you not... No, never! You remember what you said to me? The big job comes first. - Nothing will stand in it's way. - I don't care. I won't do it! I could not... - No, no, no! - You, Frederick Line... take Mildred Gamely to be your lawfully wedded wife? - Say: "I do." - I can't. It's like I have been seen to plead guilty. - That's no need to be nervous, dear. This is his first time. It seems that it's all happened rather quickly. Madame, I'm not interested in speed so much as results. - So do you want or don't you? - He wouldn't be here if he didn't want, would he? - I am sorry... but the law reprises the bridegroom to answer with the formal words of acceptance. But he's just an ignorant nit. He doesn't know anything about the law. - I do! - Hey, I said it. You're satisfied? - Very well. Do you, Mildred Gamely, take Frederick Line to be your lawfully wedded husband? - I do. I hereby pronounce you man and wife. - Here they are: our newly wedded couple! - Harold! Don't go away, Harold. - Congratulations there! I hope you both will be very happy. - Thank you. Oh, it's all happens quite quickly. I've hardly got the time to take a breath. Well, you were both rather amazing. - You have swapped the rooms? - Yes, it's ready. - Thanks again. Oh, I'm feeling a little bit tired, so much excitement, you know. - Oh, I have meant to thank you for that lovely wedding supper, professor! - It's a pleasure, Mildred, a real pleasure. I am sorry I've forgotten the cheque book but you don't have to worry. - Ah, you've all been very sweet. Wasn't that so, Frederick? - Very... Well, time's getting on, dear. - Think you will decide to go to bed, won't you? - Yes, rather. - Good night. - What? - Aren't you getting up with me to set in there? - You have to excuse Frederick for a little while. But we have some work to do. - Work? - Yes, on a little bustard. - Little bu... I don't understand. - You want to watch all night? - Surely. And all day! - Undisturbed. - They surely... Don't they get no sleep? - Well, no. It suffers from... permanent insomnia, you see. And... As in expression... poor little bustard... you know. - Good night, dear. Oh... dear. I know just how you feel. But this is very important for them. They were waiting for this for fifteen years. Oh well. We don't want to wait for another fifteen. - We can't lock the door? - No. [There's no key.] Whoever said "crime doesn't pay" knew what he was talking about. - But when I think about what I've been through today... - Oh shut up. Now, move on and do something. - I've done enough for you. I'm tired out. - Tired? - Yes. - Ah, we're tired. Isn't that a shame? I think the best thing we can do is to bundle you straight up to bed. - What do you want me doing? - Right... Now, this... I reckon that they will start on that tree tomorrow. It will take them three or four days. Now then... We have got to go about forty five yards. That means that we must dig on average fifteen yards a day. - Cool! That means to make some dinge, George! - Right!... Get digging. We start here.

Please, don't interrupt me. - But this is important, Sergeant! Yes, so is this!... Right. And this time the baritones alone. Mrs G! Sally! Oh, there you are! Take and look at that! Oh, this is the picture of my Frederick... and the professor, isn't it? - Is it a police notice? - But of course it is! They are bunch of crooks. - Crooks? How extraordinary! - Oh, not to me. No, I knew there was something funny about that lot right from the start. - I don't believe it! Tim... Mr Sinker... a crook!? Right, see: "Timothy Day". - This is the band that did that big bank job I was telling you about. "The Great Brain" and his gang. - No, really? - Yes! I had a hunch that money was hidden somewhere around here. It was probably them who was trying to enter to the yard. - Crikey, it must be hidden in that tree! - Harold, what are you going to do? Well, take on them, of course! What do you think? - Alright, you're in there, open up, I know you are! - It's no use to knock, they are not there, they've gone already, they've gone! - Gone? Where? - Don't you believe her, Harold. I know where they are. - Hiding up in her room. - Oh, so that's it! Thanks, Sal. Er, you better keep well back. This might get a bit rough. - Sally! - Mum, sorry, mum. - I simply couldn't let him get Tim. - Oh, don't be sorry, dear. Your father would be very proud of you. My father? What do you mean? Well, you see, he was in the business. He was a cat burglar. - Mum! Why didn't you tell me before? - Oh, because he was a very modest man. He didn't like people to know. - No one here. I've looked everywhere. - Look, I think we should warn them. - Yeah, where are they? - They are downstairs, digging a tunnel. - Digging a tunnel? - Yes, to the police station yard. - He was right. The money is hidden in that tree. - A tunnel? What fools! Oh, if only I had known! There's still time to do something. Come on.

OK? ♪ Let’s vary piracee... ♪ - We must be getting near the surface, no? - Come with, stupid. We've got another three foot four inches to dig out. Keep digging. If you say so. - Caving in! - You're goddamn right! Quick! Get out. Go away... ♪ ... way we feel... ♪ ...exactly two feet north of the tree, exactly under twenty feet of ten dirty great coppers. So, albeit this was miscalculation. Gives us all the more so the cause to get out of here. - Is this what you were looking for? - What... - Where did you get that? - Not now. Here, quick. - We've got it! We've finally got it! - No, George. We've finally got it! - Oh, what the difference?! Give it to me. -Ah, just a minute now. - We split the money six ways, agreed? - Did you here that? Split six ways! Give me that money! - George! All right, in six ways.

You hide things in such stupid places. - How much was there? - Fifty thousand quid! - Fif... Ha ha ha, chicken feed! - Chicken feed? - What do you want? In the next job we'll do what's worth a hundred of that. - Who do you think you're talking to? I'm the boss of this outfit! - Way-out! I'm the boss now. - This is the job I was planning with my late husband. And it is of five million pounds, isn't it. - She's mad!
