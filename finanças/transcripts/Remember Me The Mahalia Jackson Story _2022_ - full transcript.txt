Miss Jackson, I want to thank you for agreeing to do this interview today. Oh, thank you. It's an honor to be here. Ja. This interview gives your fans around the world the opportunity to look into the window of what it's like to be... Mahalia Jackson. Well, I'm honored to be here, and I'm ready to start, Mr. Hardwick. Yes, okay. As you traveled on the road, did you ever face racism, even though you are a celebrity? Oh, yes, Lord. Racism, it don't matter about being famous. Racism don't have no status. Hate is just hate. Thank you. Hi. Hi. What? "Colored entrance." Excuse me, sir, why am I coming through the back entrance? Coloreds ain't allowed to enter through the front door, they must enter through the kitchen. Sir, how do I sing and not be seen? Simple. Stop complaining and do your job. So, you don't wanna see my black skin walk through the front door, and I can sing all I want as long as I stay in the back? Miss Jackson, these are the rules, and if you cannot abide by them, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. All them people are out there to hear me. You mean they can pay all this money to hear me sing, as long as I hide in the kitchen when I'm through? Miss Jackson, I don't make the rules, I'm just following the law. I know the law. But not every venue enforces it. Well, we follow the law in Georgia. Then the law will be my voice. And even the people that don't wanna see me will hear me. They'll remember me. Several armed police officers shot gas directly at protestors gathered peacefully outside a restaurant. Police are now moving in with large dogs.

Yes, Charity. Yes. Can you tell us how your close relationship with your mother has influenced your music? Oh, my mother influenced my music greatly. All of the goodness in my music is from her. I try to put the same love in my music that she poured into me. ♪♪ Jesus Loves me, this I know ♪♪ ♪♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪♪ ♪♪ Little ones to Him belong ♪♪ ♪♪ They are weak but He is strong ♪♪ ♪♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪♪ Sing, baby! ♪♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪♪ ♪♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪♪ ♪♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪♪ Baby girl! Wow. Oh, baby girl. You ain't got the voice of just an angel, you got the voice of 10,000 of 'em. Oh, my! Oh! Oh. Mm. I'm always with you. You know I love you, right? Right. My mother meant the world to me. Don't y'all go lead Halie down no wrong roads. I heard her singing in the garden this morning. That child's marked for God. Charity, leave us alone. There ain't nothin' wrong with having a little fun every now and then, and you used to know what that felt like. Well, that was before I had two mouths to feed and before I was working around the clock washing clothes for white folk. Boy! Stop running through the house. Whoo! Oh, Charity baby, please sit down. You been running all day. Not now, maybe later. I got too much work to do. Sis, John's right, you look exhausted. No, I gotta get ready for work. That's all I seem to do these days. You act like you ain't got nothin' else to look forward to. You got a life, and can't no one take that from you. You know, we get married, just like white folk do. We have babies like 'em, we even have dreams like 'em. But the one thing we can't do is have a life like 'em. Sis, look at Halie's face. Is that what you want her to believe? Of course not. Ain't nothin' more I want than for my babies to dream. I used to have dreams too. But then life woke me back up. Cleanin' houses all day for white folk. I sit there wishin' and hopin' that one day my babies can live in a house like this. Remember when we was younger, you wanted to be a ballerina? I do remember that. Imagine me just dancing on stage. Ahh! In a theater for white folks only. I can see it now. Me getting a standing ovation, and those people whispering, "Look at that black girl dance!" Nah. My dreams are passed, but my baby's... I believe God's gonna open heaven and Earth for her. Now that's... what I'm gonna preach on Sunday. God's gonna move heaven and Earth. Yeah. Well, I guess I wrote your sermon for you, Pastor. Well, I imagine you did. All right, y'all, come on. Let's go eat before it gets cold. Oh! Oh, Charity? Charity, are you all right? - Mama? - I'm okay, baby. I'm just tired. - I'm just tired. - Okay. Listen, fix those babies some plates while I go upstairs and lay down for a spell. - All right. - All right, now, you heard what your mama said. And don't try to charm me with them pretty eyes of yours. Halie? Wanna say a blessing? - Sure. - All right, then. All right, then. Dear God, thank you for the food we are about to eat, in Jesus' name we pray, amen. Amen. Amen, amen. All right. Charity, now... I know you're tired, but, uh, I promise, this here, best greens your sister ever made. Charity? Charity? Charity! Charity! Hold on! Oh, she ain't got not pulse! - What do you mean she ain't got no pulse? - Wait. She's gone! She's just sleeping. She's gone, John. She done left us! - Mama! - Mom! She's gone. Mommy! You know how much I love you. Hmm? And I know how much you loved your mama. She was the glue that held this family together. But her heart stopped. And now she's gone, and, uh... well, things gonna be much harder for us. You remember your Aunt Duke, hmm? Aunt Duke is your namesake. Her first name is Mahala. Hmm? Say hey to her now. Hi. Hello, little lady. Young man. Now, you and your brother are gonna stay with Aunt Duke for a while. - Daddy, no! - Just till I get settled, that's all. But, Daddy, I don't wanna go. No, Daddy, I wanna stay with you! Oh, now, now, listen, I want you to stay with me too, but work being as hard as it is, I can't take care of you the way I want to. How come we can't stay with Aunt Hannah or Aunt Bell? Well, they got their own lives, and, uh, ain't kids to take care of. Now, look. Now, I'll be back. I'll come and get you, I promise. Okay? Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, now! Don't make this no harder on your daddy. When Mama died, Daddy died with her. There was no light in his eyes. It's like he stopped and let go of everything, including Roosevelt and me. But after she passed, I went to live with my Aunt Duke. Can you talk about that a little bit? Certain moments can shift your life. Especially when you're raised by a cold heart. Close the door behind you. You raised in a barn? Where you think you're livin'? Now, listen here, you two. Your mommy's dead. Ain't no point in you thinkin' I'm gonna let you sulk about it. And don't think I'm gonna be easy on you because you're a little girl. Is that what you're thinkin'? Is that what you're thinkin'? Speak up, girl. I said is that what you're thinkin'? - You're scaring her! - Boy! - Was I talking to you? - No, ma'am. Speak up. Yes, ma'am. Now, I know y'all are feeling blue. But we ain't got no time to feel sorry for ourselves. Now, go on upstairs and get cleaned up for supper. We gotta get an early start tomorrow. - Got a lot of work to do. - What kind of work we gotta do? What you mean what kind of work, boy? Colored folk work! The kind of work every colored folk got to do to take care of their own. I miss my mama. Child, we got choices to make in life. The white man gets the best ones, and us colored folk, we gets what's left. Now, get on upstairs and get washed up for supper. Whoa! Hey, Miss Duke! So... how is it going in the big city? I've been well. I can't complain. I got a good job in the front office of a new doctor in town. Mm, mm-mm. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Things are different in Chicago for coloreds. Ain't having to shuck and jive and bend myself a million different ways to please no white folk. Mm-mm. Gotta stop kiddin' yourself. White folks ain't never gonna take to coloreds. That ain't true, Duke. Things there ain't like how they are here. Chicago's magical, from the people to the energy and the music. They embrace us. Child, you sound foolish. So if you feel that way about it, why you here? Well... Roosevelt's gone off on his own now, so... I think it's time Halie come stay with me for a while. And what makes you think you can take care of her? Well, I got the time, Duke. I promised John I'd help look after her, and I wanna do my part and help shape her. Aunt Hannah, I'd like to go with you, please take me. You go when I say you go. You know how you sound talking to her like that? - What's she done to you to deserve it? - I'll tell you what she's done. She's just like her mama. I had to put my life on hold. I was just a child, a baby. So I had to watch her every single day so mama and daddy could go to work... while her mama had these wild dreams about being a dancer. So you're the one who killed Charity's dreams? I did what I had to do. And what did you tell her? I told her the truth! Don't nobody wanna see no nigger dancing across no stage. How could ya? How could you kill her dreams like that? I loved her enough to tell her the truth. - And what's your truth? - That pain... is all we will ever know. Well, I won't let you do to Mahalia what you did to my sister. I'm taking her with me. Over my dead body. It'll take a thousand men to stop me. I will not let her dreams die. All right, go. But you can leave the city... but you will always take this black skin with you. Aunt Duke had fire in her eyes that night. But the only thing I could see was freedom. Mm-hmm. That same look I had when I saw the city for the first time. Same look your mother used to have when we was kids. I'd always heard about Chicago, but I never imagined it'd be so alive. No. All the coming and going almost don't seem real. There's one thing for sure, you ain't in New Orleans no more, child. No, ma'am. It's definitely not New Orleans. Are these real? No, they ain't real, child. If they were, they'd be dead. You see I ain't been here to water them. Then why you like 'em, then? Well... 'cause they remind me of home in New Orleans, or at least what I wish home would be. What do you wish? When folks see a rose, they don't care that it's red. In fact, they embrace it. They see all the beauty in the life that it has. I wish that's how white folk would see us. Well... it ain't much, but it's mine. So I hope you learn to like it. I like it already. Well, come on. We ain't got much time. Time for what? Time for church, child. I hope you ain't thinking you got out of serving the Lord 'cause you ain't in New Orleans, 'cause Chicago's all about Jesus. - Yes, ma'am. - And you might wanna think about, you know, signing up for the church choir. Really? Yes, really. You got a voice, young lady, and I think it's time we're getting you out there using it. Now... Halie, I know things was hard for you living with your Aunt Duke, but... things is gonna be different. It's gonna get better.

The words on these songs. These are powerful. Yeah, they were prayers, you know. Some were hopes, some were sorrows. I can see how the songs lifted you up. - Mm. - I know when I've gone through storms in my life... And to tell you the truth, I've been through quite a few... There's a hymn of my own I keep close.

I'm here to see Mr. Williams. - Mahalia? - Hi. Hello, Mr. Williams. Here's our superstar. - Wow. - Come into my office. Oh, yes. Have a seat. Oh. Well...

Are you ready? - Yes! - I said are you ready... - Yes! - for the amazing... incomparable Duke Ellington! Hey, sugar, you lost? You here with somebody? Oh, no, I'm looking for some friends of mine, but I don't see them here yet. Well, honey, you are in luck, 'cause I pride myself in never meeting a stranger. Why don't you come on over here and sit with us a spell? Oh, I don't want to be a third wheel. Me and this beautiful lady have been together for years. - It's fine with me. - Yes, and we always enjoy meeting new people. So now, what's your name, sugar? Uh... I'm Mahalia. - Mahalia Jackson. - Ooh, okay. Why you lookin' so scared? I guess 'cause I never been in a place like this before. My aunt, if she knew I was here, she would be so upset with me. Oh, oh, so you sneakin' around, huh? Sounds like something I used to do. No, no, it's not like that. It's just I spend a lot of time at the church. Well, ain't nothin' wrong with that. And ain't nothin' wrong with havin' a good time, neither. Mm-hmm, that's right, 'cause even the Lord turned water into wine. Well, he did that at a wedding, not at a place like this. Okay, you're right, you're right, but, honey, if you don't want to enjoy places like this, then tell us why you're here. Actually I signed with a record company and my friends invited me here to celebrate. Well, well, well, we got a singer in our midst. - Indeed, we do! - Did you sign with one of them big jazz record companies? No, I don't sing that kind of music. I only sing for the Lord. Well, I'm glad you ran into us so we can make you a bit more comfortable. Mm-hmm. 'Cause this ain't even as low as we can go. Watch that, now. Take it easy, and if it's easy, take it again. Okay! I love it when you say that, baby. - And when you give it to me. - Oh, wait a minute now. Oh, there you are, Halie. Sorry we're late. I can't believe we get to see Cab Calloway. And Charlie Parker on the same night. Oh! Please excuse our manners. I'm Geraldine, and this cute lady next to me is my sister Evelyn. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. - Y'all excited for tonight? - Mm, "excited" ain't even the word. Honey, the best jazz you're ever gonna hear is right here in the south side. - I hear Dizzy is here too. - Mahalia Jackson... get ready for a night you won't forget. Take a seat there now.

Nice to make your acquaintance. Oh, well, uh, I'm a big fan. I love your music and your dancing, all of it. Oh, and you know what? Cab, she tells us that she is a singer. Not just any kind of singer, a gospel singer. So, you must be some kind of singer, then, 'cause gospel's from the heart. Yeah, I do all right. You must do more than all right. See, all kinds of music is from the mind. But gospel, ah, it's special. Its music is from the soul. Sing your truth. As long as you remember that, you'll do just fine. Yeah, I see you tried to show me up there. - Good show. - It wasn't that hard. You have the class, I have the moxie. It seems this young lady may show us both up. Is that right? This here is Miss Mahalia Jackson. Oh. Well, young lady, you never know. Maybe you and I will get to record together sometime. I'd be honored. Miss Jackson, I have a feeling you're about to take the world by storm. Look at that. A prophecy for your life! See you later. Thank you so much for coming, and God bless you.

I'm truly standing in the presence of greatness. I've been meaning to contact you. You see, it's my belief that you could play a significant role as an ally for the movement. Oh, anything I could do to support the cause, I'm willing. As you know, we advocate nonviolence as we strive for a peaceful resolution for the tyranny brought against our people.

How has a gospel artist been able to draw such a diverse and far-reaching fan base? Well, I've been blessed by the mighty Lord to have people who love the music. I've sung in Tokyo and to emperors and queens. I've sung to millions of people around the world. So, you know, it's hard to hear the word "fan," when in my heart I feel like we're all just a big old family, all different colors, and it's the music that brings us together. - Mm. - Looks like you're enjoying it. Mahalia. Well, now... this is how you're supposed to cook. Mm-hmm. Where in the world did you learn how to cook chicken like this? What you mean? I'm from New Orleans. And if you can't cook, you ain't from New Orleans. I'm movin' to New Orleans. You can ask John. I've been to every church house picnic from here to Mississippi and I'm a witness, can't everybody cook. Martin, you better stop talkin' about them people food. I'd rather talk about it than eat it. That's much, much better. - Mm-mm. - Wow. Listen, you keep this up, now, might snag you a husband. Oh, no, I'm waitin' on Jesus. He the only husband I need. Mahalia, Jesus is a confirmed bachelor. You're gonna be waitin' a very long time. Very long. Seriously, Martin, I mean, how do you feel the way things have changed, seeing all these changes? What's your heart like? Well, to tell you the truth... some moments I see great change. Others, I pray for more. God's will be done. I mean, still, you must feel good. People's hearts awakening, their voices are opening. And that ain't nothin' but Jesus. Reminds me of a dream I had. What kind of dream? A few nights ago, uh... I couldn't sleep. Had a lot on my mind. I'm sure you do. When I finally fell asleep... it was a deep sleep. Almost like it was real. What was in the dream, Martin? Well... there was people everywhere. And I'm not just talking about any people. People of every color, every nation, every religion. All of us treated as equal. And that is a beautiful dream. Yes, it is. You want some more chicken, John? - Oh, you ain't heard about John Lewis? - -What about John? He been all over the south, ain't seen a plate he don't like. John, Martin tellin' on you, he tellin' on you. He gonna eat. John gonna eat. ♪♪ Oh-ooh ♪♪ ♪♪ Blessed quietness ♪♪ ♪♪ Holy quietness ♪♪ ♪♪ Blessed assurance ♪♪ ♪♪ In my soul ♪♪ ♪♪ On the stormy sea ♪♪ ♪♪ Jesus speaks to me ♪♪ ♪♪ And the billows cease to roll ♪♪ ♪♪ Mm-hmmm ♪♪ ♪♪ Mm-mm ♪♪ All right, now, y'all. See you next week. Great rehearsal. Whoo, girl, that may be the best singing I've ever heard in my life. Excuse me? Do I know you? Possibly. I've been picking up my friend James from rehearsal the last couple of nights. Oh, that's where I've seen you before. James played drums with the band, all right. So, I guess we aren't strangers after all. I guess not. Well, I gotta go. Oh, wait, uh, can I give you a call sometime? - I don't think so. - Aw, please. I'd like to get to know you. Just give me a few minutes of your time. Sigmond was my second husband. And we fell in love quickly. I guess you can say he swept me off my feet. Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson. He was a charming one, that one. Mm! Sounds like a whirlwind romance. It was. But you know, like everything else in life, it took a turn. But if you look at this column, I'm telling you, we are still on track to improve our revenue 28%. Only 28%? Mahalia, 28% is good. You're on track for a banner year. Good is not enough, not the way I work. I need better. Well, what do you propose we do? Well, you see, here it says that... it looks like the balances, we're not receiving all our balances from the venues. Well, most of them, yes, but, you know, from time to time, they have different reasons why... Excuses, more like. Excuses... why they don't wanna pay. I mean, some promoters, they pay late. Some of them not at all. We're not playing that game. Everybody gotta pay their due. Spread the word to all the venues, I want all monies up front before I perform on stage. That'll take care of that. Yes, ma'am. Well, is there anything else? Uh... yes, there is. All right. There was an offer for you to perform in Las Vegas. - Las Vegas? - Mm-hmm. Lord, no, Cyle. Mahalia! Look, the promoters are offering $25,000 a week for you to sing at the Flamingo Hotel. Tell them I decline. I'm sorry, I just don't understand. Why? Because I'm not compromising my principles over money. Not doing it. But your ministry is to spread the good news. To sinners, not to drunks. I'm not performing in a place that sells alcohol. - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. I will let them know. - Anything else? I think we're done. - Uh... Yes, uh... Dr. King has also requested that you make more appearances at his rallies. Yes, yes, of course. Let him know it's fine. Cyle? Is there something going on? I feel like you want to say something. You can talk to me. I've been getting a lot of phone calls. Uh-huh. I just didn't know how to say this. Just... speak your mind, baby. Sigmond's been seen with another woman. - We want to give you that... - Thank you. And then I want to give you a little bit of extra. - And thank you so much. - Thanks for having me. Mm-hmm. Give you a call later, later on. I'll be looking forward to it. Bye. Okay. ♪♪ Mm ♪♪ Thank you. Mahalia, listen, you're experiencing extensive diabetes and heart complications. Look, you've been traveling, touring back-to-back, recording. Your body needs rest. Doctor... I appreciate everything you say. I really do. But this is my calling. This is what I do. God's work. Well, you know, you can do God's work and get rest too. At the end of the day, the decision is yours. But if you don't make some serious changes, and I mean quickly... Listen... just slow it down, okay? Yeah. - Thank you, Doctor. - Mm-hmm. Martin, they've arrived. They're preparing them for the march. Mahalia, I appreciate you traveling all this way from Louisville to assist in the march. Martin, like I said before, I'm always here. It's just so hard to see so much hate spread down south. Hate is a dire disease, we have yet to find a cure. Our people are in a critical moment in this country as we consider our next move. What challenges do we face down here in Louisville? My brother A. D. Has informed me of some inequalities and discrimination in housing and development. What inequalities do he see? Well, limited housing for blacks on one side while the whites are given the ability to live free. That sounds just like New Orleans. On one side of the street, you have the haves, and on the other, you have the have-nots. The only difference is, our black brothers and sisters in this city deserve to live the same freedoms as our white brothers and sisters. Why does everything for us have to be so hard? Because we're not marching for just us. We're marching for those men and women who managed up the confidence to walk off that bus. Men and women. Who may not understand the magnitude of what they're about to face. We're faced with the task of educating them. Raising up a new generation, young minds that will embrace the potential of new possibilities. Martin, young minds lack the patience we once had. - Hah. - It's like they want everything now. With perseverance, they'll get it. Equal housing will be a luxury future generations will take for granted. You've all been called for a magnificent moment. Today in this place, we will be visited by history. I'm not gonna lie to you today. You'll be met with some of the most vicious acts of hatred some of you have ever encountered. But remember what brought you here... what your reasons were for braving those fears that paralyze most yet rose you up from your complacency. Freedom is what we seek here today. The call for something that is greater than ourselves. There are moments in your life where you must make a decision, a formidable decision. The decision is not whether we move forward, we know we must move. The decision is whether we move with the force and strength powerful enough to shatter the very stones of hatred that have surrounded us on all sides. It's a lonely walk. It'll try the very center of your heart and resound in the depths of your souls, yet we find heart knowing we travel this journey not alone. For God is with us on this journey towards justice. God is not just in the first step, he's in the last step. And his step is eternal... and will carry us toward freedom. Amen. That's right. All right. Let's go. Mahalia, can you explain to your fans the intricate friendship you had with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.? Martin. Martin... he wasn't just a treasure to the world... he was a treasure to me. He was an icon, and... even before I met him, I knew God himself had sent him here to heal this world. But when did you realize you would become a pivotal part of the movement? Oh, I knew early on. God spoke it to me. Martin would share his dreams for this world. He wanted us to be united. He wanted us to be one. ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho, Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho, Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ You may talk about the men of Gideon ♪♪ ♪♪ You may talk about the men of Saul ♪♪ ♪♪ But there's none like good old Joshua ♪♪ ♪♪ At the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Hallelujah ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho, Lord, Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ Up to the walls of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Sword drawn in his hand ♪♪ ♪♪ "Go blow them horns," cried Joshua ♪♪ ♪♪ "'Cause the battle is in my hands" ♪♪ ♪♪ Hallelujah ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho, Lord ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ That mornin' ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ Jericho, Lord ♪♪ ♪♪ Yeah-eah-eah ♪♪ ♪♪ Joshua fit the battle of Jericho ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came tumblin' down ♪♪ ♪♪ And the walls came ♪♪ ♪♪ Tumblin' ♪♪ ♪♪ Down ♪♪ As I was listening to the powerful words from our anointed sister, Mahalia, the words that stood out clearly, proudly and boldly for me, the very last line: "And the walls came tumbling down." - I know that's right. - Yes, yes! Walls that have surrounded the negro race for many a year now... - Bring it on, Pastor. - The walls of injustice have imprisoned our people for generations. - Come on! - Come on now! Walls that have kept God's children from seeing the optimistic possibilities that should be freely given to every girl and every boy. - Amen. - Amen. Walls have kept our young black men attacked from every side and prevented our young black women from the respect to which they are entitled. I just stopped by to tell you tonight I'm tired of sitting back and sitting still. Yeah! We will march against the pervasive hatred that has bound us from freedom. We will march against the oppression that has clenched innocent minds on the basis of color. We will march against the rampant attacks of police brutality and inequality. There's nothing dwelling on Earth that God is not in. He's in the mountains and in the valleys, from Mississippi to Alabama. He's in the high places yet dwells in the low. He's with you when you're up and even closer when you're down. His love surrounds you in your joy and even more in your pain. Let the church say amen. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm Atlanta welcome to Miss Mahalia Jackson. Well, hello, Atlanta. How's everybody doing? Oh, no, y'all a little quiet for me. Come on, now, if you're feeling all right, say, "God is great!" God is great! Yes! It's so good to see your faces. You know, I wanna start with my favorite song. It's called "How I Got Over." Do you know that song? Yeah! Oh, you do know it! Well, that was written by my good friend Miss Clara Ward. You know, sometimes in life, we go through things and it seems like it's impossible to make it through. Things come 'round we don't expect, and it feels like we can't make it over. - Preach! - Come on, now! We're having problems at work, problems at home. And we can't even walk down the street without being beat down for the color of our skin. How many of y'all know that we have a savior that will turn up and turn out right when we're ready to throw in the towel? Well, let me tell you about me, how I got over. ♪♪ How I got over ♪♪ ♪♪ How did I make it over? ♪♪ ♪♪ You know my soul look back and wonder ♪♪ ♪♪ How did I make it over? ♪♪ ♪♪ How I made it over ♪♪ ♪♪ Coming on over ♪♪ ♪♪ All these years ♪♪ ♪♪ You know my soul look back and wonder ♪♪ ♪♪ How did I make it over? ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪♪ ♪♪ But soon as I can see Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ The man that died for me ♪♪ ♪♪ Man that bled and suffered ♪♪ ♪♪ He hung on Calvary ♪♪ ♪♪ And I want to thank him ♪♪ ♪♪ For how he brought me ♪♪ ♪♪ And I want to thank God ♪♪ ♪♪ For how he taught me ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, thank my God how he kept me ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, I'm gonna thank him 'cause he never left me ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell me how I made it over ♪♪ ♪♪ I've been fallin' and risin' all these years ♪♪ ♪♪ But you know my soul look back and wonder ♪♪ ♪♪ How did I make it over ♪♪ - Sing it, girl! - ♪♪ Mm-mm-mm ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm gonna wear a diamond gown ♪♪ ♪♪ In that new Jerusalem ♪♪ ♪♪ I'm gonna walk the streets of gold ♪♪ ♪♪ In that homeland for me and my soul ♪♪ ♪♪ And I'm gonna view the host in white ♪♪ ♪♪ They've been travelin' day and night ♪♪ ♪♪ Comin' out from every nation ♪♪ ♪♪ They're on their way to the great congregation ♪♪ ♪♪ They're coming from the north ♪♪ ♪♪ South, east and west ♪♪ ♪♪ They're on their way to a land of rest ♪♪ ♪♪ They're gonna join the heavenly choir ♪♪ ♪♪ Yes, we gon' shout and never get tired ♪♪ ♪♪ And then we gonna shout "Glory hallelujah!" ♪♪ ♪♪ Then we gonna shout ♪♪ ♪♪ All our trouble over ♪♪ ♪♪ You know we got to thank God ♪♪ ♪♪ Thank him for being ♪♪ ♪♪ So good ♪♪ ♪♪ To me ♪♪ ♪♪ Yeah-eah ♪♪ You must really think I'm a fool. Like I don't know who you're talking to in the middle of the night. I told you a million times, she's a friend. Funny how men say a woman is just a friend, yet it's never what they make it out to be. You have no proof I've been with another woman. They say the eyes are the window to the soul. And I see straight through your heart. I know. That's all the proof I need. You got some kind of nerve throwing accusations against me. While you're out singing, getting all your standing ovations on the road, I'm fighting here alone to take care of this family. All that singing, out on the road, is helping take care of this family. I'm the glue that holds this thing together. And I'm the man who loves you, woman! Look... she's just a friend who I reached out to because my wife is never home. I'm a man and I need someone I can talk to. Why do women always have to choose between what makes a man weak and what makes a woman strong? That's your fight, Mahalia, not mine. I know a lie when I see it, Sigmond. I've been through lies with my first husband, and I refuse to go through it with you. I'm not going to let you break me. I wasn't trying to break you, Mahalia. I was trying to love you. Not the way I deserve to be loved. Then I guess that's my cue. - I'm getting my things and we're through. - No. I'll send you your things. Hello. - Miss Mahalia. - Yes. You got a phone call. Who would be calling me this time of night? It's Dr. King. Oh. Hello? Hello, Martin, everything okay? Sis... It's been... it's been a mighty long day. I think I could use some encouragement. Of course, Martin. I completely understand. Let's see, um... I think what comes to mind is this. ♪♪ I must ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ All of my ♪♪ ♪♪ Trials ♪♪ ♪♪ I cannot bear these ♪♪ ♪♪ Burdens alone ♪♪ ♪♪ In my distress he ♪♪ ♪♪ Kindly will help me ♪♪ ♪♪ He ever loves and ♪♪ ♪♪ Cares for his own ♪♪ ♪♪ I must... ♪♪ Martin. ♪♪ You must ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ You must tell ♪♪ ♪♪ Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ I cannot bear these ♪♪ ♪♪ Burdens ♪♪ ♪♪ Alone ♪♪ ♪♪ I must tell Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ I must ♪♪ ♪♪ Tell Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ Jesus can help me ♪♪ ♪♪ Jesus ♪♪ ♪♪ Alone ♪♪ Thank you. And then suddenly, the world turned dark. - Hey. - Hey. What is it? I'm so sorry. Cyle, about what? What is it? They shot him. They shot Dr. King. He's dead. I'm sorry. They killed him, baby. Hmm-mm. I'm so sorry. - No, Cyle. - Baby. No, Cyle, no. Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Cyle. - Good evening. Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of nonviolence in the Civil Rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee. Dr. King was standing on the balcony of his second-floor hotel room tonight when, according to... Mahalia, I'm gonna go grab the car. All right, I'll see you in a minute. I got you! - Oh! - I got you. Cyle. Will you... write down a... a passage for me? Mahalia, you need to rest. Please. Please. Do this for me and... and read it. Of course. The scripture is haunting me. Psalms... 119... 119? Verses... 17 and 18. "Deal bountifully with thy servant that I may live... and keep thy word." "Open thou mine eyes." ♪♪ No more... ♪♪ Why don't you sing that hymn that you always sing when you get tired? Oh, I know. I know the one you're talking about. Yes.
