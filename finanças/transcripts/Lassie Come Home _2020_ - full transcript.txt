Damn mutt. Wait until I catch you. Come, let's eat grandma. Come, let's eat, grandma. As you can see, a comma at the right spot... can in fact save lives. Alright... on to the next example. Idiot. Hello, Lassie. I'll cut it short. To start with, I want to thank each and everyone of you. In the past years you have been fighting tirelessly... for keeping this company alive, which makes this day... on which we... have to close our gates permanently... after over 400 years... even harder. Lassie. Yes. Yes. You have found this whole way all by yourself. You're the best, Lassie. You're the best, Lassie. You made it. That stupid dog shows up here everyday anyways. It's nothing special. It is something special. What did you say? It is something special. Because we moved and... Lassie walked the way to school for the first time. How cute. The baby needs a dog to pick him up from school. I'm not a baby. Then prove it... Baby. Hey, give that back. Give it back, that's mine. What are you laughing about, come here and help me. Stay here, stupid mutt. Come on Lassie, retreat. Come here... yes. Yes, Lassie. Come. Poke. Yes, poke. Let's go, Lassie. Come. LASSIE COME HOME Let's see, if you're brave enough today. So... Get the chicken. Yes, come on. Get it. Come on, get the chicken. Please. I believe in you. Go, get it. You don't have to be afraid, ok? I'll show you. It's easy. You see? Easy as pie. Now you must feel pretty dumb, right? Very funny. - Actually I wanted to do that. - That's out of the question. You have worked all day. Come here. Sit down. Eat. Alright. In that case I will give you the orders from here. Oh yes, I'm really into that. So how was it? Sad. The count gave some last farewells and uhm... Well. You know. Hey. You will find something else. I'm sure. Maybe... not as a scaffolder. Come here. That dog critter has to go, that mangy. Ricky tick. When I showed you the apartment there was no word of a wild animal. Wild animal... Lassie won't harm anyone. It ran me over, that bastard. My groceries, all ruined. I could've fell down the stairs. We're sorry. It sure must be difficult for you, so alone. I don't need compassion. I can take care of myself. Of course not. Andreas just thought... For the love of god, the unemployed... They're always trouble. It's not like we're both unemployed. My wife still has her job. That's neat. And you're probably proud of that too? Your wife cooling her heels in the bakery in her condition. It's alright, Mrs. Möller. No. It's not alright. You have signed a lease... which allows small animals only. That dog critter will be gone by tomorrow, or you'll be kicked out. You can't kick us out just like that. Uhm... Maybe it would be better for now to find someone... to take care of Lassie for a few days. Until the situation has cooled down. - Hm? - Hm. Flo, did you swim home? Give me a break. Oh Lassie, why are you so afraid of water? It's alright. I still think you're the best, hm. Hey, stop. Stop, I'm already wet enough. Hey. Come on, you're my last chance. Lassie is easy to handle and it's only for a few weeks. What? Oh yes. Sure, in that case it won't work of course. Bye. What should we do with you now? Ah. Andreas. Good morning, Mister von Sprengel. Oh. May I? So beautiful. I was about to go see you anyways. Because of the recommendation letter. Oh, follow me. I have them here... somewhere. Great, even more glass. Stop, stop, stop. Do they look like some... unwashed mustard jars from the grocery store to you? I don't think so. Liquidator. Caution. Sadly my entire property has to be... sold. I really hope, that you will... find a new job very soon. But a man with your abilities... We are looking at a very rare... Unfortunately there's no demand for men like me in our area anymore. In Jena they're looking for a master, but that's quite far away. That means starting over and moving again. Lassie, I got it. We have to pick up Flo, I'm sorry. Come. Oh, don't forget about your granddaughter. The bus arrives in 30 minutes. Oh goodness gracious, I totally forgot about that. Oh... no, no. Go away. Go away. Hey, Lassie. You're a really clever one, hm. Go away... In difficult times dogs are always a comfort. Am I right? Yes, that's Lassie. Stop it now. Unfortunately we are temporarily looking for a new home for her. Ah, that damn clasp. Grandpa! Whoops. Sorry, everything okay, grandpa? Yes yes. I almost didn't recognize you. Where is your father? Didn't he want to drop you off? He's in Singapore right now. Or was it Australia? Oh. Let's go. Grandpa? What kind of dirt ride are you driving? Haven't you heard about climate change yet? My young lady, maybe you have missed the fact that we are living in the mountains. You need all-wheel-drive here. You might as well put a bullet in a polar bear. Are we driving? Oh that is going to be fun. Flo. Flo. Flo. Leave me alone. You can't give Lassie away. It's alright. It's only until mom and I have come to an agreement with Mrs. Möller. That stupid cow. Don't say things like that. Alright... you can say it once, but only once. 3, 2, 1... Stupid cow. Do you feel better now? No. Me neither. But believe me, it's for the best. Especially for Lassie. It will be great for her, like a vacation on a farm. There are other dogs, they can romp around... and you can visit her as much as you want. Is there really no other way? Unfortunately not. That lazy blighter. Gerhardt! I'm sorry. - She is very affectionate. - Ah. Ah, our guest has already arrived. Oh. Did we wake you up? What? Of course not, I just finished up with weeding. While lying on your back. Interesting technique. - Hello. - Hello. Let me lend you a hand with the luggage right away, dear lady. Are you injured? No, that's from cliff jumping in Acapulco, but... Oh god. - How long are you planning to stay? - Only for a week. One week? I once was in South America for half a year... and walked from Tierra del Fuego all the way to Costa Rica. Do you know what I had with me? One underpants and two sets of socks. Just had to wash them. But they have lakes, rivers and the ocean. Are you done... I can't hear that anymore. May I? This one seems to be important. Well... then. Didn't he just limp on the other leg? What? Oh, baloney. Come, We're expecting visitors. That poor boy. Composure, Gerhardt. We have to make it as easy as possible for them. Of course. You have to make sure that Lassie feels comfortable. Huh? That is a nice and responsible job. But grandpa... I don't have a clue about dogs. Andreas. Count. Florian. That is my granddaughter, - Priscilla. - Hi. I've known you since you were... this small. Priscilla will lovingly take care of Lassie. Grandpa, I never had a dog before. How am I supposed to know... What? And she's supposed to take care of Lassie? Flo. Florian, I assure you: Lassie will not lack anything here. Look, our groundskeeper, Mister Hinz. He's preparing a comfortable spot for her. Come on. I'll do it alone. Come on, Lassie. Well then. Welcome to your parlor. You have to know one thing: She's very afraid of water. Oh, really? You don't have to worry about that. We will get along soon enough, right? Easy. Come on. It's alright. I'm sorry, Lassie. But otherwise we will all be kicked out of the apartment. And mom will have the baby soon. It's only temporary. I promise. No, Lassie. Stay. Goodbye, Lassie. Flo. I'm sorry. Flo. Fl... It's only temporary. It'll be okay. Let's go home, alright? Hay fever season. That poor thing. Why are they actually leaving her here? Andreas' family has lost their house. And in their new apartment there are no dogs allowed. Hey. It's alright. It's all good. I know what it's like to be a stranger. You will see... Tomorrow it will all be easier. I think someone has dressed up as Flo. The real one would've eaten his Kaiserschmarrn by now. That cocky priss probably thinks that Lassie is her dog now. Where do you even know her from? Priscilla's dad, Sebastian and I, uhm... we used to be friends. And uhm... Then something really sad happened... Priscilla's mom, Kate, died in a car crash... and with her the count's wife, Priscilla's grandma. And her dad? Sebastian couldn't bear it here anymore after that. Everything reminded him of his wife. I get it. Yes, but Lassie certainly isn't dead. That's right, Lassie is on vacation. Is it good? Mhm. Right? No, no, no. That doesn't work for me at all. Why do I have to drive all the way up there only for a signature? Do you think I'll sit in the car... and drive up to the North Sea for 7 - 8 hours? I can do that at a local notary just as well. What? Goodbye... Idiot. Gerhardt? Gerhardt?! There's no need to scream I'm already here. I have to go to the summer residence on the island. That dense liquidator guy... Are you sick? Where's your suit? This may surprise you, but I like to put on something more comfortable at night. For how many days do you want me to pack? Pack? Where are we going? You won't be going anywhere. You stay here with Gerhardt and the dogs. You have to take care of Lassie. Ah, Gerhardt. My darn watch went missing again. That was your grandma Elisabeth's wedding gift to him. This is making me insane. But grandpa... I thought we would spend the vacation together? Uhm... We'll do that as soon as I'm back. But we could take the dogs with us. For crying out loud. Where is that darn watch? Grandpa... Huh? I'll help you find it. You shouldn't get upset like that. That's not good at your age. Hang on a minute now. At my age. I am fit as a fiddle. Your blood-pressure pills. Timing, like a high precision missile. So? Hm? - Alright. - Yes! Thanks, grandpa. But you take care of Lassie. I will. I'll go packing. A splendid decision, if I may comment. You may not. Mh... Tell Hinz to load in the dogs. We will probably need the van up there anyways. We need to clear out the house. Gerhardt? I wish there would be a better moment, but... I don't know for how long I will still be able to pay you. You should look for an equal kind of occupation. My kind of occupation, as you call it, has been banished in most occidental countries for more than 200 years. Are you trying to hint that I'm exploiting you? I am trying to hint... that I will assort our papers, socks and jackets... until your last breath. I am the chewing gum under the sole of the shoe that's your life. But what if you die first? Don't worry, you wouldn't survive one week without me. Always having the last word. For a good reason. Hey, Flo. Why are you sitting out here all by yourself? Didn't you want to see Lassie? Better not. That'll just make her sad if I visit her today already... and leave again without her. Hm. You just know her best, huh. I wanted to paint the baby bed soon. Want to help me? Give me a hand. Damn it! Don't be so sassy. Hey, we'll just go on a little trip. Come here. Stupid mutt. It's alright. 5.000 Euros... Oh yes. Costa Rica, here I come. Alright honey, off to the North Sea. Grandpa, Lassie looked so sad. Why won't we let the dogs sleep inside the house? Priscilla. I said, if you come along you'll wait in the car. So please. Then maybe Lassie won't be so homesick anymore. So why not? Because, because... Because. Because dogs have a dense fur... and they don't want to sleep in our sweaty beds. - But... - No buts. Get in the car. Alright, let's get it over with. Radio Jena with your current traffic update: Look out for speed traps on the B88 heading downtown towards Wöllnitz. congestions and slow flowing traffic on the following roads: On the A4 heading to Gotha between junction Erfurt and Neudietendorf. 5 kilometers of traffic jam... I made a catch too. Mhm. And the bun, did you catch that too? Indeed. It wasn't all that easy. Very, very carefully I came closer... But then I brought it down. When your father was your age... he and your grandmother... used to sit at this exact spot... and fed the seagulls. We could convince dad... to come here with us next summer vacation. What's wrong? I have to sell the summer residence. And our days at the manor are probably over soon too. What? - Why don't you ask dad? - That's not an option. He makes so much money with his company. No. Grandpa. Please don't be mad at him. He misses mom so much. He can't bear it, when everything reminds him of her all the time. I believe... that is why he sent me to this stupid boarding school. Because I also remind him of her. Let's go, I don't want to leave Lassie alone for so long. Let's go for the longest walk of all time. Aye aye, Milady. From here to Newfoundland. Walkies. Ey, easy, easy, yes. We want to make a good impression. Stop it now! We won't become friends anyway. But soon I'll be sitting in my own Surf-Bar on Costa Rica... and in the meantime you do as I say. Stay still now! Stupid cur. Shut up. Lassie! Ok... You want to know who's boss? As you wish. Stop it now! Ey. What's going on? What are you doing? Ah... Oh god. No, no, no. Stop. Lassie! Grandpa, stop her! Stupid cur... Lassie. Lassie. Lassie, stay! Priscilla. Oh boy. Nothing but trouble with that critter, ey. You should be ashamed. Why? Dogs don't get beaten up here. - Yes, but... - Never! - Mister Count, I... - Get out of my sight. I don't want to see you anymore. You're fired. Wait, I know my rights. You can only do that after a verbal warning. - And a written one. - You can have both. After I've pressed charges for animal abuse. And attempted robbery. Looking for something? It was in the car, I wanted to give it back. Of course you wanted that. Mister Count... Oh, your leg seems to be a lot better. The mainland is this way. Priscilla, come here. Don't worry. I'm sure we can still catch up with her. Lassie! Lassie? Hello? Dad, where were you? Lassie is gone. What? Lassie ran away from the count and Priscilla on the island. I wanted to bring her her toy, but the kennel was empty. - I've taught her so much... - I know. but not how to survive in the wilderness. - She's out there all alone. - Flo. Listen. I'm absolutely sure Lassie will be found soon. It's a tiny island surrounded by nothing but water... and Lassie won't go into the water anyways. She can't leave from there. Hey. Off to bed you go. Look. We've created a page for Lassie. That's a fantastic idea. And to the schools and kindergartens on that island... we've sent out a photo of Lassie. She trusts children. Where were you? In Jena. I know, we said it's actually too far. And suddenly you sat in the car and drove 400 kilometers... Sandra, they're closing one glass factory after another. If I quit too it's another one less... and at some point our craft dies. When? That's the other catch. They need me now. How are you going to do that? What about the baby? And what about Lassie? Maybe I can gain some time. They would even provide us with an apartment. It'll be great. Dogs are no problem, this time I've checked. Hm. I'm sure they'll find Lassie soon. Lassie! Lassie! She's asleep. Completely exhausted, the poor girl. We've searched the entire island. No trace. I can't explain it. Here. It's not on the list of the liquidator. Maybe it helps finding Lassie if we offer a reward. The watch, are you sure? I'm sure Elisabeth wouldn't mind. Where are you? Don't be afraid. Brownie. How did you get in there? Okay. Well... Not a single scratch. Lassie. Lassie. Lassie. Morning. Good morning. You're already up. I can't sleep. She keeps kicking me. Hey. - I think she wants out. - Hm. And? Nothing. Still no trace of her. They should've found her on that island by now. Something must've happened. Maybe she did get off there. Yes, but how? Even if, it would still be 800 kilometers back to us. That's simply too far. I'm not sure anymore if Lassie will make it home. Don't say that. The count has offered a reward. Maybe that helps. Yes. Maybe. Tino. I have eyes on my back as well, you know. Why? I was just tying my shoe. And my hair is green, hm? But Florian... You haven't written a single word yet. That one... he's just thinking about his stupid Lassie. If I had a dog I wouldn't let it be taken away from me. Hey. Flo? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Stop it. Stop it. Flo, there's no fighting here. - I will beat you up! - Tino... Sit down! You two as well... Tell me, what is up with you? I know you have loved Lassie a lot... Not loved. I still love her. Everyone acts as if she's already dead. Even my dad. But she's out there... somewhere. I know that. Okay. It's okay. You know what? The test can wait. Instead let's take a look at which way Lassie would take, if she were to go directly from the North Sea... to our school. Okay? Yeah! So... Well. If somewhere around here is... where she left off... and she walks around... well... 30 kilometers a day... Does that sound about right, Flo? Then at this point she would be around... here. Have a good one, alright. Dig in. - Thanks, Ronny. - Well, of course. Hey Maiki, old sport. - All good? - You all right? Yo. - The special, as usual? - Yes. But please speed it up, I'm in a hurry. Tootsi. Oh, how cute. So, and now my secret ingredient. My homemade special sauce. - Come to daddy. - There you go. Hey. Oh great. Hey! Will you stay here. Hey, stop! You little shithead. What in the... Alright, get inside. Looking for something, Ronny? Oh Ronny. Get a move on, we're starving. Yes, I'm coming! Sick. It stole all the sausages, that shithead. Deep breaths, take deep breaths. - Are you okay. - Mom? Flo, it's alright. All good. All good, I'm just taking mom to the hospital really quickly. I'll come with you. No, you can't come with us. Mrs. Möller will look after you. She's upstairs. What? But because of this dumb cow Lassie is missing. Flo. But she is a dumb cow. Dad said it himself. It's a long story. Florian... Mrs. Möller isn't all that bad. And there's no other way. Just be nice and I'll be back really quick, alright? But... Mom? I love you, Flo. I said no. But I need to call dad, it's an emergency. It's Lassie in the video. It's not even recognizable. Are you blind? This is Lassie. I need to call dad. Snotty brat. Your father has other things to worry about than your nonsense. Instead you could make yourself useful. You could start packing. you haven't even started on the house moving. Huh, what house moving? What house moving? The one to Jena of course. Because of your dad's new job. Hey. How did you do that? Franka and Toots. Respect, Lassie. ♪ I give to you a yodeler, a dashing yodeler ♪ ♪ a dashing yodeler is what I give to you. ♪ ♪ Such a real yodeler, a real yodeler ♪ ♪ one that will make you happy. ♪ ♪ When we yodel, in a duet ♪ ♪ then yodeling will be nice. ♪ ♪ I give to you a yodeler, a dashing yodeler ♪ ♪ a dashing yodeler is what I give to you. ♪ Stop! Stop, please! Please. Are you crazy, boy? Sorry. I really have to catch this. Toots, what is going on? Okay, okay, it's alright. Do you have to go for a walk? Let's go. Come on, boy. Little thief. Yes, I'm on my way. You're a real drama queen today. How am I supposed to take you seriously as a watch dog... if you keep yapping around? Hey. Wait. Let's make it quick, alright? When will we see each other again? I'll write to you. Okay. Maybe I'll get myself one of those things with internet as well. Then we'll always be in touch. Go, run fast. Run fast. They're still too hot. No, no, no, wait. Are you hungry, stowaway? You can walk away anytime... but it's cozy here. And there's food. Toots. Come, bring that to our guest. Well, you mysterious stranger. How did you get on top of our roof? Especially without us noticing. Alright, without me noticing, okay. Show off. So what is going on with your wife now? False alarm. But she's staying in the hospital overnight for monitoring. How was it with Flo? He was sitting in his room sulking the entire evening. Pretty childish. He wanted to call you because of his dog video. He wouldn't let it rest, that boy. Of course I said no, Because that dog didn't even look anything like yours. For God's sake. That's Lassie. I won't come with you to stupid Jena. I'm bringing Lassie home. Flo. Did you tell him about the house moving? Yes, was that a secret or what? Oh great, thanks a lot. You will stay here. And when the boy gets home you will call me. And if my wife calls, you say no word. Mister Maurer, it's really not my fault. The boy was outrageous and unteachable. Well, then you two have one thing in common. Oh man. Oh, that damn battery. Priscilla? Hey Flo. Do you have a charger with you? I left mine on the bus. I don't even have a phone. What are you doing here? Same as you. Searching for Lassie. If you hadn't taken her on that dumb island in the first place, she wouldn't be gone now. Man yeah, I know. You can be mad at me later. But first I will help you to find her. Who needs your stupid help? Someone without a phone? Flo... Wait a minute. You don't even know where Lassie is just now. Excuse me, I'm almost out of battery. Look there, the junction box. Lassie jumped from there on to the trailer and then on the roof. That's how she could escape. Sick. Not bad, Sherlock. And where is Lassie now? They're giving a show in Neuenburg today. A bus goes there. You're a genius. Are you crazy? Why did you do that? Because I'm happy? Okay, then stop being happy. Come on or we'll miss the bus. So, Lady? It's okay that I call you Lady? Are you sure you don't want to be our special guest today? Alright, have it your way. Come on, Toots. Showtime. Look over there. Applause for our mystery guest. The mysterious stranger... Lady. Fire! Ah! Just you wait. Gotcha. My first class ticket to Costa Rica. Come, quickly. Man, we missed them. If you hadn't kept asking for directions... we would've still caught the bus. Huh? First of all you ran off to the wrong bus stop. Wait. We still got their license plate. The police can definitely help us. I still got some battery left. Are you insane? The police? They will take us with them until our parents are here. But if we don't find Lassie now we will never find her. - Because we will move to Jena. - What? You will move to Jena? Yes. And Lassie doesn't know about it. And neither did I until yesterday. Hey, Flo. It'll be alright. We will find Lassie. Hey, Sherlock. You're always so smart. Where are they going now? They are performing in Friedrichstal tomorrow. It's only 10 kilometers south of here. And as long as they're going south, Lassie will go with them. Why? Because she wants to come home. To me. But it doesn't matter. No busses are going there anymore. Come on. Your granddaughter's phone hasn't been used since yesterday. But someone must've seen her? Sebastian. Von Sprengel, hello. - Priscilla's father. - Hello. My son. You've done enough. I'll take over from here. How are you talking to me? Who do you think you are? If I may make a comment... This is neither the right place nor the right time. - You got my number. - Alright. I will keep searching the area... until I have found them. - Excuse me please. - No problem. - This just came in. - Thanks. A bicycle was stolen. A note with Priscilla's number on it was found on the crime scene. And the following message: Sorry, it's just borrowed. Need to find a dog. P. Hey... hey. Oh come on, don't do this to me. Please. Come on. Come on. Come on. Now come on. Ah... ah uh. Piece of shit. Yes, you little greedy guts. I'm coming. Toots... no. Leave the bunnies alone, Toots. No, not again. Lady, you're holding position. Toots. Stay here. Ouch. Ah. Did you hear that? The barking. That was Lassie. Uhm, no, I didn't hear anything. It was quite far away. But it was Lassie. It came from over there. Lassie. Flo, wait. Just wait. We've already been over there. Let me drive off the byroads again. Do you have a second job as a salesman or what? What? I think, you should talk to your father. How? That man is an island. What's there to talk about? Especially since mother passed away. It's exhausting to talk about it. Maurer. What? But you said it was a false alarm. Stop. Tell my wife I'm on the way. I'm coming to the hospital. The baby is on its way. I have to go back to the hospital now. Oh man! Hey, don't panic. We'll manage that, okay? The children can't be far. We'll be back on the street and get you to the hospital in no time. Alright, and which way? No idea. This way. Let's go. Miss Brandt? Von Sprengel here. We found the bicycle. He he... hey darling. Payday. Lassie. Don't yell at me. Lassie. Ey. Lassie. Lassie, you made it. I'll never leave you alone again. I promise. You won't be able to keep that promise. What are you doing here? Me? Cakewalk. I just followed the videos and the yapping. And now I'll take what's mine. Never. Let's go Lassie, quick. Let's go, Lassie. Locked. - We can't get through here. - Over there, the boat. Leave him, Lassie. Come. Hey. You want a war? You can have a war. Oh, damn. - Come on, let's turn around. - Shh. Listen. This way. Let's go, we have to get to the other side. Flo. That's too dangerous. The current is too strong. No way. Come and help me. Come here, stupid dog. Lassie doesn't swim, it's our only chance. Damnit. Stay still. Come on, harder. Stupid cur. Come here. The boat, quick! Catch it! Where are you, you bastard dog? Come here! Come here! Priscilla, I'm coming! Get out! Flo, help me! - Priscilla! - That came from over there. Let's go. Get out! Get out! Jump already! Let's move. Lassie, go away! Lassie, no! Help! Lassie, swim over here. Lassie, no! Lassie! Lassie! No! - Lassie. - Lassie! Lassie! - Flo. - We're coming! Dad. Alright, Alice in wonderland. I hope that taught you a lesson. Dad, over here! Oh god. - Priscilla. - Flo. - Stay calm. - Dad. I got you. Lassie. Hold on to that. I got it. - Do you have it? - I got it. - Dad. - Priscilla. - I can't go much longer. - Hold on tight. You take care of this one. We're almost there. Careful. Careful, the stairs. Hello. Hey, hello. Oh shi... No, wait. This is a big misunderstanding. I didn't want to hurt the children. Just the dog. That sounds funny. I didn't want to hurt the dog, I just wanted to abduct him. - Oh man. - Don't move. I just wanted to go to Costa Rica once. I've never been there before. Everything okay? Lassie. - Ah. - Flo. - What is it? - My knee. Show me. That's a pretty big bruise. That has to be x-rayed. But I need to go to Lassie. Leave it to us. We've rescued many animals before. - We'll look for her. Go with your dad. - But Lassie needs me. Andreas, if you don't go to the hospital now... you'll never forgive yourself. We'll stay here and keep looking for her. And you go to your wife, Andi. Thank you. Come on. I'll help you, come on. No, leave me alone. But we have to go to mom. Flo. Don't worry. We'll find Lassie. I promise. You wanted to move just like that. But I'm not coming with you. Lassie will never find us. We should have told you. That was my mistake. I'm sorry. But everything will be ok. They will find Lassie... and she will come to Jena with us. Ok. Come on, we have to go... Let me down. I don't believe a word you say. Flo, mom needs us. Lassie. Lassie? Lassie. We should turn around. It's getting dark and we need to walk back. I made a promise to Andreas. Between you and me, the current shouldn't be underestimated. I don't believe the dog made it out of there alive. Why are you whispering? You're totally shaking. You need to warm up now. Could you maybe borrow me your phone? I believe... I've lost mine in the river. - Thanks. - You're welcome. And uhm... Could you get Priscilla to a hotel on the way back? I'll stay and keep searching, okay? And tomorrow I'll take you to boarding school. Hello. Von Sprengel here, do you have a vacant room? Stop. I don't want a hotel room. I want a home. Grandpa? It's me. Yes, I'm fine. Grandpa, can you come and pick me up? But I don't know where I am. Can you take me to the police station? Yes. Will you pick me up there? Priscilla, I... Okay. Thanks. Listen, I know you would rather live at the manor... It's not about that. The manor will be gone soon anyways. What? The manor, the factory... Grandpa has to sell everything. Still I want to live with him. He's my home. And I wish you would be too. I'll drive her. Flo, my darling. Come here. What's wrong? What happened? Later. Hello Bella. Hey. Look at me. Everything will be alright. Hm. Everything will be alright again. What are you doing there? I thought you're at school? I've just hung up the last fliers. Dad, I was at the lookout... Lassie is close. Really, I can feel it. Hm. Come here. We've tried everything. We hung up fliers with our telephone number, we made posts everywhere. But no one has seen Lassie since the riverside. Flo, I'm really sorry, but... You have to accept that Lassie... No, I will not. Why won't you believe in her? I didn't mean it like that. Yes, you did. I actually wanted to make you a dog, but... I can only do polar bears. It's beautiful. Now we just have to let it cool down... then you can take it with you to boarding school. I'm not going to that stupid boarding school. Why can't I stay with you? Priscilla, please. You know why. It's not possible. Promise you will give the boarding school a chance. It's all dad's fault. He should have never left. Then we would all still be together. No, no, no, It's not dad's fault. After your mom's accident I have completely withdrawn myself... and hid behind my desk. And I left dad with you and his sorrow alone. He always said: I live on my island. And he was right. So why don't you scoot over a bit. Dad. Take me to your island. - Come here. - Dad. Now come here, you old fool. Alright, that's enough. For now, yes. Let's go to work then. - What? - What. Did you think I would surrender everything, our family has built up in over 450 years, to a stranger? Purchase contract? Partner? Partner. Now all we need is our master. Flo. I was actually thinking of Andreas. No, they're moving away today. Andreas has a new job and it's Flo's last day at school today. Well... what are we waiting for? Let's go, quickly. Flo. - Flo, stop. - Flo, please. Lassie will always try to come back to me. And I will be there. I don't care if you want it or not. What now? To the school. Priscilla? Dad. She made it. Yes. Leave it, leave it. She walked all this way by herself... she will make that last stretch too. - What's going on there? - I'll get Bella. Flo? Flo? Flo. We need to go. I'll need to pick up the keys... - to the new apartment. - Oh, just take this one. Or do you not want to move into the house of the new factory manager? What? Your new house has enough space for five children. Excuse me? And a dog. Nice, Flo. Your dog is awesome. Lassie. Yes. You made it, Lassie. You're home. Oh, Lassie... Just five more minutes. Oh, no. Come on sleepy head. Come on Toots. Alright, come on. Let's go. Bye, Lassie. See you later, Lassie. LASSIE COME HOME
