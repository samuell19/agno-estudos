That's what I ask you I thought I explained myself well last time didn't I? You did indeed, as a God. But you did not convince me. No. The market is big too big for one man so I thought to leave the horned beasts to you and the pigs for myself. You are in charge of the market for cows and oxen and I the market for pigs. It seems fair to me. Or... ...do you want to be the king of the horned beasts and the pigs? Do you know what I say? It is a real pity that we have not organized the shit market otherwise... ... the king of the assholes would be you! Don Ciccio the mouth that dares to offend Pasquale Ronciglio will not speak again if not to apologize. If you are a man of honor I'll wait for you at 11:00pm at the Arzano warehouse. Agreed.

I won't do it, I won't do it and I won't do it! He won't do it, he won't do it, he won't do it! - Author! - Author! - Author! - Author! What an hassle I can never be calm. - Author! - Author! Author I say it! Author says he! Author! Call the author! A moment, what's up? Let's see if it's possible to take slaps off the script! I say yes! I can't take anything off. It's the song!

Madonna, he killed me! Is it possible that one must get angry early in the morning? I tried to give some sense to my role, because a guappo that does not react is not a guappo! But if it's okay with you... At least try to pay me a little more as an incentive. - I protest! - Forget it... Giovà I don't think today is a good day to speak about work. Let's talk later, okay? All right. Nicolì call Roberto, let's go. Right away. My gentlemen You know what? It is useless to go around obstacles. Let us postpone the matter of the slaps this evening. Let's get back to rehearsing, come on. Yes Yes Yes. we'll do everything you want but I stick with my mind. Yeah Ok... - Are you stuck? - One moment... Come on, your father is waiting for you! - And I would like to hear the scream - Yes, I scream too Come on! - You have a mustache face... - Robè... Go easy, we're rehearsing. And do not move! You have a mustache face and get these slaps! Good! Good! Bis! Again Robè, you too now? - Go, Dad is waiting for you - Come on Robè... Come on, from the beginning. Let's take it back from the slap without giving him the slap. Hello! Do not you remember me? Were you in the theater at the rehearsal? In front row... And if I'm not mistaken you also looked at my legs. How could I not look at them they were so beautiful. What are you doing here? I was waiting. Waiting for whom? You. You me? And why? Because... ...well... ... I wanted to see you again! Look, do we want to quit with being so formal, what do you think? And do we want to quit saying nonsense? I do not like being stopped in the street, all right? And... ... how did you know that I was there at Sannazzaro? Uncle Giovanni told me. I wanted to see you again after that audition at the theatre - I mean, wait - And no, eh... Or both, or nothing We become informal and you leave me alone okay? But why I'm not a thief. If it were enough not to be a thief do you know how many people I would have chasing me? Well considering our times very few. Maybe you're right. You know, I think it's hard to get rid of you. In your opinion, what should I do? Scream with joy to see you again and throw my arms around your neck? No, but we could get to know each other better go out together sometimes. Should I consider it an official invitation? Yes, an official invitation! You're rich then. I'm not complaining. Would you like to go to the cinema? I can not stand it. Look, there's a better idea. I know a place where it is possible to have a snack and dance. - Agreed? - Agreed! So, see you tonight. See you tonight! It's the mirror's fault. you don't see yourself? You are handsome! Sorry dad. No thanks, I'm not hungry anymore. No no thank you. No thanks Rosa, I'm not hungry anymore. Now you repeat what I say? Sorry dad I'm not really hungry tonight. That's no true, you've devoured the soup! Soup? Yes, of course, the soup That's why I'm not hungry anymore. Listen you... Leave him alone, Rosa. He is in a hurry to go out. Did not you notice? He deserves it. He studied all year long. - Go ahead - Thanks dad! Look dad... Here is the request, eh! I get it, I get it. Ten thousand liras. I'm sorry I can not give you more. Daddy, it will be enough! Do not worry, thanks, bye! - Bye Rosa! - Be careful, my son! Pretty boy! Roberto! What's up? Where are you going? Out. Out where? What do you care? So? Go on. Then at some point he stops the Rolls and he tells me: "Do you want to get out, honey?" And I, confused: "Why? I do not live here." And he: "Yes I know but I want to show you a little thing. " Same brand? Of course, same brand. Do not you drink? You look upset... Are you feeling bad? No, I'm fine Do not worry. As you want so what was I saying? Ah yes, here I do not trust the guy very much but I get out the car anyway. He takes me to a big jewelry store. He takes a necklace of emeralds and puts it around my neck. He says to me: "It's yours! And if you do not like it we'll change it, and take everything you want! And then? After? There is not a later... ... I always wake up at the same point! Do you believe in dreams? Do you believe that if you dream always the same thing at some point, it'll come true? I do not know I never dreamed. But it is not possible! Everyone dreams. Maybe you do not remember it. No, it's impossible. I have a strong memory. I remember even the color of the panties that you brought when I saw you the first time. Shame on you you shouldn't say certain things. Listen, what do you do in life? So what's your job? I do nothing. Are you that rich? No, I mean that I am unemployed. I finished school a month ago. You're one of those daddy's brats graduates, lawyers, what are you? I am an accountant, only accountant. Accountant? Are there accountants that are millionaires? That made a lot of money? I do not think so. I like this song, let's go! This way. Who's that girl? I do not know her it's the first time she comes here. And is she alone? No, she's with that guy. Please, Mr. Ronciglio. What can we bring you tonight? The usual. Good. Not bad at all the girl, eh? I like dancing. I would do it all night. What is this? The bill. Damn, what a rip-off! Why, how much is it? Fifty thousand. Something wrong, sir? No, it's that... I'm afraid I don't have enough money with me. What are you talking about? You do not have the money You do not have the money to pay the bill? to pay the bill? What's happening? The gentleman can not pay the bill. - Take them to the office. - Please gentlemen. One moment. They are my guests. And bring them a bottle of what I drink. - Right away. Have a seat. You are very kind. Really... ... I do not know how to thank you. Mr.? Ronciglio. There is nothing to thank about. It's nothing. I like to be with young people Especially when they look so nice. Thank you. You are very kind, Mr. Ronciglio. What's your name? Ninfarosa. A graceful name. And what do you do? I am an actor in a small theatre. Nothing important yet. You're young, you have time to succeed. It depends on your effort and on the right friendships. And what do you do? Nothing at the moment, I'm unemployed. Roberto is an accountant, he graduated recently. And, you know nowadays he has yet to find a permanent job. He also needs the right friendship. But he does not have it... Come on, Ninfarosa this is not the moment. Let her talk, what's wrong You care about it, do not you? I would be very grateful to whom would give him a hand. Let me look into it. Tomorrow come here in my name and something could be done. All will work out fine. - Thank you! - No worries. To your luck, guys. Now let's have fun, eh? Shall we dance? With pleasure. Dolphin calls Shark. Dolphin calls Shark. If you are listening, answer. Dolphin calls Shark. Dolphin calls Shark. If you are listening, answer. Over. Shark listening. Shark listening. I am in the established area. Over. I am in the established area. Over..

All right, shut off. I saw them. It's positive! Come on, we are almost done Boy, ready? Yes done! All right! Roberto! You finally arrived! My love! Here it is. Say what you want but for me the best coffee is always the old-fashioned one. Those modern traps are good for nothing. I agree! Hurry up Rosa or I'll be late. Here it is. How is this work going? I'd like you to tell me something about what you do and who these people are. Come on Robè, talk to your dad. Dad, now it's just a training period. For superstition, I prefer not to say anything. And you know it's about administrative checks. A company... of canned food. You know accounting books, tax reports, then if they are happy, in two months they will hire me. That's all? That's all. Now I have to go, bye dad. Dear Rosa, this boy is not telling the truth. I'm loaded, go! So, are you happy? - I'm really happy. - You like it, eh? Yes! You are indeed earning a lot of money with this job! Can't complain! Is it dangerous? No, it's not dangerous it's a piece of cake for me! - Wait up! Look, that's so pretty Will you buy it for me? Which one? The one over there. All right, come in. - Will it be very expensive? - No, come, come! I'll buy you whatever you want! This one, Mariù? I do not like it. Then your mother will come see it. Come on, move or your mum will get angry! And what are you doing here? Why do not you go back home? Are you angry with me? And with whom then? With Roberto. Roberto? What did Roberto do to you? Come on, tell me everything. Come on. So? I met him this morning. He was with a girl and he kissed her in front of everybody! Where? In the middle of the road. In the middle of the road! Here, now talk slowly and tell me everything Ok Mariù? Go, go, boy, go! Yes, get close. So you are the accountant, eh? Good, full inventory boat and warehouse and be careful, Don Pasquale is very picky. All right. - Have you got the load invoice? - I have nothing. Have you got the warehouse load invoice? Yes, here is everything you just have to check it and sign the receipt. All right. Robè? Yes, dad? Come here. Actually I'm tired I would like to go to bed. Instead, you will talk to me first. It has been a long time that we haven't seen each other, you and me. Come here. Well you know... ... there is a lot of work at the office and then... And then there are women What did you say? Who's that girl, who kissed you on the street without being ashamed? Who told you? This does not matter. Answer. She is a girl. This I already knew. - And then? - And then nothing. We get along well and we go out from time to time. Once, we were used to introduce the girlfriend to our parents. Dad, she's not a girlfriend. Nowadays, these things are not serious. Maybe to you. - Not me. - Sorry dad come on. One doesn't have to marry all the women who... who...? Go on... I mean we get along well and that's it. Who is she? You know her, she works in Uncle Giovanni's theatre. She is a young actress. - Ah, that little hottie? - Do not call her that! I call her what she deserves. She has already caused a lot of trouble. Careful Robè Those are women that first lift you up and then sink you. Ninfarosa will not do it - She's like the others too - No, they're all lies! And I do not allow you to say that! What did you say? You do not allow me? Your father? Sorry dad. It's that now I'm not a kid anymore. I'm a man. And I have the right to my own opinion. The rights are won by merits. Not by chatter! Your mother, before she died I promised to defend you any cost - And I'll do it Robè! - All right, defend me. Defend me from whatever you want! But do not push yourself into my life! Because it's mine and mine alone, do you understand? Roberto! What will you show me now? Now I'll show you all the land on which we have put our hands before the Regulatory Plan. But... - Are these lands close to town? - Yup. That is, outside town but near the houses all in the building area with building permits. What about the mayor? All right, the Plan is precise. Excuse me. - Don't worry. - Come, come. Sorry Don Pasquale I would like to show you the last operation in Mergellina. Here it is This is the withdrawal made for the gasoline for the deliveries and this one instead here, this one is the fuel withdrawal for the motorboats. - Very good, Roberto - And this... ... this is the amount given to men employed in the operation. Please sign over here. Good job. - I see you're accurate. - Thank you. - He's a good boy, I'm happy. - Yup. So Don Pasqua', here are the areas that interest us. Don Francesco still owns the Mercedes. Good for him. The only thing left from when he was a Boss. Where's the stuff, did you steal it? You have to pay for it, do you understand? Leave this boy immediately! Piece of shit! Who are you? Come here. What did those two want? - Money. - Money? Why? Because... ... they gave me some stuff and now... ... now they wanted to be paid. Why? For this. Drugs? You are crazy! At your age? Do you want to ruin yourself? Stop! You go away and you too. As for you. I advise you not to meddle if you do not want Don Pasquale Ronciglio to get pissed off Ronciglio! Even the children... Listen to me, listen to me well. You came out of the games covering yourself with shit and covered with shit. You have to hide You are out from guapperia And if you want to live without trouble think about your own business don't get involved. Is it clear? You're out. This is not guapperia it's just disgusting. Anyway, I've warned you. You're out! How disgusting... Ninfarosa! Ninfarò where are you? Hello. I didn't hear you get in. What's wrong? What was Pasquale Ronciglio doing here? My business. Are you jealous now? I do not want that man to step foot in this house He must not look at you. Is it clear?! Wait a moment I do not take orders from anyone and from you the least! I see who I like and when I like. If it suits you, it's like that and we are friends or else... - Whore! I do not allow you to talk to me like that and I will not allow that filthy man to do as he wishes! - Where are you going? - Guess. No... Roberto, wait a moment. Roberto! Since when you don't knock the door? I have to talk to you. It's not a good reason get out and knock Don Pasquale, I have to talk to you about serious things. You? You are kidding me before talking about serious things you must be a man. And to become a man, it will take some time. I want you to leave Ninfarosa alone. I want? - Did you say exactly "I want"? - Yup. I said it. You are crazy. Today your head isn't working. Go away or I'll kick you in the ass. Let's settle this thing, first. You'd better. Listen up, boy, why should I do it? If I leave being kicked by you from this office. I'll be back soon with the police! Police? What does the police have to do with it? I've understood something too Don Pasquale Ronciglio and in certain situations everyone uses the weapons he can and you do not just import rags And what do you know about it? I know. The police still doesn't but I do. I know everything that happens here. and dealing drugs isn't a game. You know it well is it not true? Sure. I know it very well, you are definitely right but there is no reason to make it a big deal. Work is one thing, private matters another. No, for me there is no difference. We just need to talk through these things! Among people of honor there must not be any misunderstandings, and a woman has never been so important, for Pasquale Ronciglio, to push him to compromise work and friendships. Yup... I like Ninfarosa. I do not deny it. But not to the point to risk my position. You can keep her. She's yours. Then you assure me that you will not see her again? Sure. On your honor? I assure you that girl will no longer be a reason for disagreement between us two. Word of Pasquale Ronciglio. Thank you. Greetings, boy. Come. Come, come. Listen to me very well.
