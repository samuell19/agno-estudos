- I'm telling you, that's the kinda shit that killed Hammer's career. - The rapper? - I'm not talking about Arm and Hammer, motherfucker. Bust shit. Hammer was one of those Frisco roughnecks first, right? That was his image. Then he put on them big Sinbad the Sailor pants and went bare chested, calling himself an entertainer, right? That means pop. Clearly a crossover move. Can't fault the man for reinventing himself as per the market trends, shit, I close this joint down and trade in them spears and masks for ninja outfits and samurai swords in a nanosecond if a bunch of Koreans moved in around here. - It's Japanese. - Well fuck it, I'll sell sushi, too. [jazz music] But back to my point, Hammer fucked up when he tried to go hard again. Now let me digress, when old Hammer went pop, he lost hardcore brothers and got Teddy in the country mall, but when Teddy heard from the streets that Hammer was a sell-out, Teddy stops listening. It don't matter that Teddy is the one that Hammer sold out to, because young Theodore just wants to be down. So Hammer's now stuck with supply but no demand from either constituency, pop or hardcore. [jazz music] - Do I have to give you a drum roll to get to the point? - What I'm saying is black folk in general wanna stay black, in thought and spirit. And in the hood, if you're gonna be hardcore down, you can not even smile. That shit's a capital offense in the street by laws. [jazz music] - What does this have to do with my speech? - I see I'm a hafta go remedial on your ass. [jazz music] [alarm buzzing] [alarm buzzing] [alarm buzzing] - Hey listen. I need you to help me write a speech for Nicole. No. It's a, for the school where she teaches. She's not a counselor there anymore. No. She teaches math now. Algebra, I think. - Why does this have to be a race speech? - I don't know, I think Nicole wants to impress her principal, you know? - Isn't it career day? Aren't you supposed to talk about your job? That's what the guest speakers did when I was in school. - But there's all this sensitivity and multiculturalism, change, you know, stuff, diversity training in schools and all that. - So the principal wants some sort of sensitivity seminar or something? - Yeah, yeah. I guess so, I mean. - What do you know about sensitivity? - You read the article on race relations in the workplace I did for Essence Magazine? - Sorry, my subscription ran out. - Maybe you might renew, 'cause you might learn something. - So these three paragraphs make you an expert? - Richard, you gonna help me write this thing or not? [hip hop music] - Nah, girl, you can't tell me he is that shallow. - He is, Labrega, I've known him longer than you. - But didn't he go to that Million Man March? I saw him with the T shirt! - Girl, that don't mean nothing. A brother can be as Afro-centric as you want and still be skeezing on the side. Now he's having his party at the house, but it was early, right? So my brother's up there with two of his boys, watching the game, folks coming in. But they not gonna get up off the sofa and welcome nobody, right? The game's on. Like them sorry-ass Knicks going anywhere anyway. - Okay, everybody knows they can't beat Mike. - Beat Mike? They gonna beat Mike when Mike put his Nike's in his locker. Hello. So anyway, one of my girlfriends comes over and she about 5' 10", statuesque, size two, model. - Oh, she's other. - Oh yeah, now they just go up and leave the game. They kick their little tired rap to acting all suave bow-lay and what not and do you know what the first words our of my little brother's mouth were? - Go on. - Oh, you got that good hair. - We might not see eye to eye. - That's okay, with your help I figure, I can write this thing fairly. - I've got my biases, too. - I never said you were Gandhi. - Oh, by I enjoy my peace my friend. - Come on, man. Told Nicole meet me here at 8:30. - Nicole's coming here? - Yeah, she left something at my apartment the other night. - Does she know you haven't written the speech? - No, and I would appreciate it if you didn't mention anything. The last time she thought I wasn't doing something she wanted, I didn't have sex for a week. - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did. - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did. Later on, I charged him up about it, too. I said now you know if that girl had had a little nap, if her shit wasn't relaxed, you'd have been sitting on that sofa rooting for John Starks. - That's the truth. - Of course that's the truth. - Alright, no problem. But just so you know, I think race is something that just doesn't get settled. - I hear ya. No, actually, I disagree. But I think it'll be good in terms of a speech, you know? I mean, the differences in our thinking, that's what's gonna make it work. - Don't be too sure. - I appreciate your honesty. But you're gonna help me, right? - Yeah. Mikey, one thing, though. - What? - No O.J. I'm tired of O.J. - No problem. No O.J. [hip hop music] - What the fuck is this? Aw, for Christ's sake. I knew I shoulda gotten this thing tuned up. God damn it. Alright. Okay, here we go. God. - So what do you think of O.J.? [laughter] - I know, I can't think of anything, either. Ssh. Alright, what if we just talk about some topics? - We'll make a list. - Yeah. - Okay. - I'll write up the script later. [hip hop music] - I was in a bar having lunch, and they just cheered for the verdict, like thank, God, O.J.'s free. - It wasn't the verdict. It was the payback point in the injustice column. For once the system fucked white people. - You think that? - Yeah. - You really think that? - Yeah. - I don't feel guilty about 200 years of slavery. - 400. - I mean, it was before I was born. What? - 400, it was 400 years of slavery. Jamestown, Virginia, 1609. The first slaves were brought there and they were slaves on the long ass boat ride before they got there. 400 years. - At the turn of the century, W.E.B. DuBois said that the greatest problem facing America was the question of the color line, and it still is. - What the fuck do you know about W.E.B. DuBois? - I took a Black Studies elective to get out of a statistics class. Help me get together with Sharon Williams, too. - You got Sharon Williams? Bro. I tried to date her for the longest time. - You were too nice. - What? - You wouldn't make fun of her. - Oh yeah, yeah, that woulda worked. - I think you were in your proud Afro-centric phase when you couldn't make fun of your African Queen. - Slow down. Slow it down. - I'm telling you, Sharon Williams was one of those rich girls from Cherry Hill. She didn't see color, she saw class. - What, I don't have class? - Not with her. I'm telling you. You don't get to those girls by being nice, man. They grow up with those prep school boys hanging on their every whim. - So did you do the old wound and heal, is that? - Oh yeah. Cut them, praise. Miss a date, bring flowers. - How was she? - What, why are you looking at me like that? With that, like, look on your face? - I don't know. Alright. Nothing special. - You know, I was at the club, you know, PePe's place? And I'm sitting in there with my little Tanqueray and tonic like I like to do on occasion. Now back then, I wasn't getting much play, my hair was about that short, and even though I was looking cute, nobody was paying me no mind. So I get this idea, I'll go back to that same club one week later, weave down to here. Let me tell you, they were all in my business, girl. Brothers just coming out of the woodwork with drinks and everything. - See, they thinking, ohh, she must be mixed, she ain't all black. - See, that's why I gotta give props to Chico DeBarge. You see that new video he have? - No, is it on BET? - BET bought something, anyway girl, he's got a regular brown skinned sister as the star of that video. Mmhmm. You know we never see that. - You're not lying. - Tupac? Please. He's gonna tell black people what to do? - He recites some history. - Oh please, all these gangster rappers telling black people with college educations what to do. That doesn't strike you as odd? - Okay, so you're saying that lower class blacks have the upper and middle class in check? - You know it. You get called Uncle Tom in a second if you went against the kind of agenda they set. Right? I mean, I'm not saying be white, but this tough guy stuff is not exactly your Stanley Kaplan formula for success. Imagine if white people were dictated to by white trash? We'd all live in trailer parks in West Virginia and be the most populous state. - These brothers are just hung up on this European standard of beauty. - And there's so few black men as it is. - They either in jail, gay, or else they're hung up on that light, bright, better than white perception. - LSP. - Or they jump across the track to a white girl. - Oh now, see, I don't think that's LSP, though. I think that's 'cause them white girls give up the orals right quick. - Now see, I know that's right. My room mate up at Rutger's, she was always talking about that shit with her friends. They damn near think they enjoy that mess. - Do you know what I can't stand? Is when I see a brother with a white chick and she ain't even that cute. - Okay! - I mean they either can't handle us or they just aint' interested in loving nobody, right? They lost. I'm telling you, slavery is still messing with people. - Oh, it ain't over. It ain't over. Drama ain't over for the soldier just because the war is over. - You got that right. Ooh, girl, we got to go. - So, when's your brother coming back? - Next week, I will tell him you were talking about him. - No, don't say anything. - I know how to set people up, I'll hook it up. - Alright. What do I owe? - Nothing, I can put in for this. - I was hoping you'd say that. - Cheap. - Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear, what is L S P? - Light Skin Presumption. You know, like when a black woman dresses up with long, straight hair, short, tight, skirt and. - Heels. - Yeah, like that, like a white girl. - Okay. Well thanks. - No problem. Hey, you on duty? - Sure, where ya headed? - Houston and Broadway. - Hop on in. - What, 40 acres and a mule? - Yeah, knowing Spike Lee, that's a black thing, right? - Leave Spike alone, man. - Oh, it's Spike to you? - Yeah, Spike. Spike goddamn genius Lee. - Oh, Spike Lee is no genius. - What, you're crazy. - His movies are like film school level with that floating actor crap. I mean, they're not even walking, what is that? - Come, you ever notice how black people always get criticized like that? - Ooh, you're not getting away with that. - What? - White people never get to criticize anybody black. - Oh, really? You coulda fooled me. - It's so taboo to say anything bad about black people today. - Stop, stop it, just stop it. You wouldn't say anything about, like that about Coppola, Scorsese, De Palma, even a dude like Cimino, you wouldn't? - Oh, well, Deerhunter was long as hell. Shoulda been called The Unbearable Length of Film. - Yeah, well you wouldn't be so critical, I mean, you see Do The Right Thing? A great movie, lost the Academy Award to Driving Miss Fucking Daisy. Huh? That shows you the mindset of the Academy. Subservient blacks. - Don't even go there. - What? Fine, I'll let it go, I'll let it go. But you gotta deal with the black quarterback issue. - That I will do. [marching band music] - Why is that every black quarterback coming out of college is too short to play in the pros? - I don't know, hormones perhaps? - Ha ha ha, right. - Don't you think these owners are business people? I would think that they would want the best product out there, that's all the players are to them anyway. So why wouldn't they let them play? - They wouldn't let them play. You ever hear of the old boy network, hello? And, hell, most of the season ticket holders, white. In fact, all those motherfuckers all drunk up in the stands are white. - White with jobs to pay for tickets. - Yeah, well, hey, that shit is documented is all I'm saying. Before the NBA learned how to market Larry Bird and Magic Johnson's smile, white people weren't going to the games because they couldn't identify with the overly black product. Look that shit up, it's in the newspapers in the 70s. - The 70s? This is the 90s, Michael Jordan's jersey is probably on more white kids' backs than black kids. I don't see any white kids walking around wearing Steve Kerr jerseys. - Well you just need to recognize that times haven't changed that much. Steve Kerr? Shit. - I mean, that's all you ever saw in all them old black and white movies. - I know, you never see any white cab drivers anymore. - Oh no, just people with names you can't pronounce. - Girl, the other day I had this cab driver with this name, it was something. Saddam Saddam Fuckman. - I had him too, the other day, girl. It was a short Korean dude with like 10 of them pine air conditioners. - Yes, that's him! - [Driver] I just hate it when they don't speak English. - That's right. - So tell me, what happened to all the white cab drivers? - [Driver] Third floor of the Museum of Natural History, right next to the dinosaurs. [laughing] - What does this mean? - I don't know. Haven't been hanging around the kids lately. You know the higher and higher I go in my career, the less and less white guys I meet. - White guys? You mean blacks. - What'd I say? - You said white, you meant black, right? - That upset you or something? - What? - You were all indignant. - You mean like I can't believe you said white guys, not black? - Yeah, like that. - I'm just saying you said the wrong thing. - Yeah. - You gotta admit, it sounds a little weird. I mean there aren't a lot of black people as you go up the corporate ladder. That was what you meant, right? - Yeah. - See, this is what I was talking about before. White guys can't say anything about black people. - Excuse me? - It's true. - True what? I wasn't the one getting upset about it, you were. This is your shit. - You were getting a little sarcastic there. - Come on. - Alright, you don't agree with me that a white, heterosexual male can't catch a break? - Oh, poor baby, they say bad words and hurt your feelings. - I'm serious, if you're white you don't get cut any slack. - Try getting lynched. Can we just move on? - You think you just aced me, or something? - This is not about. - No, see I wasn't really satisfied about what we said about this before. - So what is it? Too many stand-ups making fun of white guys for your taste? - Oh, fuck you, you don't understand what this is like. See, everything is geared toward making blacks look like the good guys. Affirmative action, the media, all that. I think it may be the greatest problem facing white people today. Is we're expected to feel so guilty about everything. It's bullshit. It's bullshit, it is. See, I don't think blacks should be able to get away with hiding behind the past anymore. I, for one, am not gonna stand for it. - Must be white thing. Guess I don't understand. - No, I don't think you do. - Why should you like the black part? You don't know shit about being black. - See, now that's ignorant. - I'm ignorant? - Yeah, that's like saying I can't understand what it's like to be a French woman. - Oh, you do? - Well I can read. - You don't bleed. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. - No, fuck you. This proprietary shit is so outta line. The other day I'm standing right next to you, and that friend of yours, what's his face, Mustafa, makes some reference to white boys. And he knows I'm your friend. - How long you been holding that back? - Since it happened. - Uh huh. - Don't pretend you don't know what I mean. White boys is the equivalent of saying niggers. - Step off. - It's like me saying those niggers. - Hey. Just hold it with the N word. - It's like someone saying those niggers while you're in my presence and I say nothing, expecting you to just go along with some unsaid thought like, I don't mean you, you're one of the good ones. - Lemme explain to you. White boys is not the same, at all, as saying the N word. - The way he said it, it was. You say boy in that context, it has a negative meaning, just like it did in slavery times. - Oh, so you mean that when a black man says white boys is the same as when some big, fat Louisiana cracker sheriff calls a black man boy? - Yup, it's like some kind of boy reversal thing going on. White people today can't say boy in reference to black people. - Really? - Yeah. - You should take a driving tour through the historic South, my friend. - Well, I think you're wrong. - Hey, well, I think you're wrong. - Can you back that up with anything? - History? - Revisionist history? - Fuck you, man. - No, fuck you, why do you have to be such an asshole? - Why do you have to be such a white boy? - Fuck you. - Fuck you. [buzzing] - Hi, Nicole. - Hi. - Good morning. - Morning. Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'll see you later. - Okay. - Hey. - Hi. - Then they asked me to gimme a getting married thing, you know, so I gave 'em my, my copy of Huckleberry Finn. - What? - Well that's what I was reading at the time. - Shit. - Yeah, right, that's exactly the way they looked at each other, like what the fuck is this? But they don't say anything, you know. I figure that was their first time. Then on top of that, I give 'em my keys, too, I mean, goddamn, my parents were just a few feet away in the house. - Wait, there were two of 'em? - Oh yeah. - Well what'd you do? - What'd I do? I watched them walk off with my keys, my Huck Finn and my one dollar, all that I had. And then about 15 minutes later, I come bolting out of my house with a baseball bat in my hand, walking up and down the park, you know, I'm wanting my piece. I'm pissed, you know? Like pissed off, they got 50 cents a piece. And crazy, too, like the bat's gonna do something if they show up with a gun, right? - I bet you hated all black people right at that moment, didn't you? - I didn't say they were black. - You didn't? - No. - Then what were they? - I don't know, they were talking some kind of Spanish or something. - So you're not gonna tell me what happened? - Nicole, I told you, nothing. - You're right, you told me nothing. Come on, you're being exceptionally cranky for a morning person. - Here's your stuff. - Thanks. - Hey. I can't believe this. - Where you going? - Your job is to take me where I wanna go, man, not ask me questions, okay? - Lunch time, no gas, go home, bye. - Hey! Damn bastard. - Can I get the cab now? - You shouldn't have to. - And babies shouldn't die of SIDS, that's the way the world works. Black people, men especially have a different reality in America and the sooner the people understand that. - Oh, the people? What are you, Angela Davis with a skin graft now? - I think that as soon as African Americans accept the screwed up nature of things American, the sooner they can lose the rage and move forward as a people. - Thank you, Doctor Freud. - Don't dismiss me, Michael. I'm not some white, Liberal woman with a cause. Okay, I'm a white, Liberal woman with a cause, but I've also got a point. Every people on this planet has been captured by another at some point. The Hapsburgs, Grecians, Spanish, Egyptians, Chinese, Aztec, Incas, Ottomans, Muskove, the Celtics, my early ancestors, the Vikings, barbarians that they were. - Look, Nicole, all I'm saying is that turning the other cheek mentality doesn't. - Michael, that's not what I'm getting at. - No, listen Bernard Shaw once said, "The rational man adapts himself to the world "and the irrational man adapts the world to himself. "Therefore all progress is contingent "on the irrational man." - The Desert Storm announcer said that? - No, the, the playwright. - Y'all need a cab? - You know, it's in your best interest to tell me what you and Richard were arguing about. - Hmm? - If you do, I won't get passive aggressive on you. Otherwise, six months from now, you'll be watching some game and I'll pick a fight with you about how you fold your towels or something and make you miss your game. Or at least lessen you viewing pleasure. - One less day of therapy a week might not be a bad idea. Okay. I haven't written the speech yet. Richard was. - Michael. Okay, I'm not gonna get angry, you were honest with me. Go ahead. - He was helping me out. - I can't believe you. Anyway. What were you two? - We got into it. He thought white boys is the same as saying the N word. - Nigger? Richard? - Yeah. - Why? - He just wanted to write the black part of the speech. - Boys. - What boys? This is not one of your little. - It's okay, take it easy, baby. - Don't trivialize this, Nicole. - You know. - This is a big thing I'm just. - He didn't mean anything. - Right, well he said that I. - A child calls a friend fat and stupid because he won't share any, any of his ice cream. Why, because fat and stupid are better cut downs than selfish. Greedy is pretty good, but not as cutting, so he reaches for fat and stupid because it's the quickest and the sharpest. - Child had to be thinking fat and stupid before. - No, not necessarily, before they went to get ice cream, that child might have been thinking this guy is the greatest guy in the whole world. The phrase fat and stupid may have never entered that child's mind before. - This is stupid. - Fat and stupid? - Stop it. I can't believe you're defending him. - Richard is your friend. You've known each other since high school, for crying out loud. - Race is a serious thing. - Only when you let it be. - Can't believe this. - I've heard lots of African Americans call each other nigger. - Yeah, well that's different. It's wrong. - Why is that wrong? You know, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin used to call each other that other dago all the time. And you know how close they were. - But oppressed races don't do that. You don't hear Woody Allen calling Mel Brooks that other kike. - Okay. Just have your speech ready by. - I'll be ready. - I know. You're a great writer. - Saying that to a writer is better than saying you're a great lover. - I know. - Yeah. - So you'll be there at 2:30? - 1:45. - Just come running up the aisle by three, okay? The principal's gonna be there. - Hey, you know something. You two would have some beautiful looking kids, you know that? - I think I'll get out here, too. Go to Barnes and Noble's and get some writing done. Maybe I'll overhear something good. - Yeah, well stand by the self-help aisle. - Yeah, good conversation? - Well, they're the most talkative. - Huh. Hey, I'm gonna get out here too. - Alright. - And can I have the receipt? - Sure. There's your receipt and your change. - Uh, no. - Thank you, sir. [hip hop music] [laughing] - Hey, baby. - How you doing? - I'm here, I thought you weren't coming. - Oh, and miss my session with you? This is my therapy. - You're so sweet. - What you cooking today? - I don't know. I'm thinking gumbo or jambalaya. - What's the difference? - How much I charge people. - How's Susan? - She called in again today. Me and Barnett are gonna be running around that restaurant like two fools. - Oh, Rita, you ain't never been anybody's fool. - I should be pissed off at her but I can't. Those damn kids of hers. They're always sick. The only thing that man of hers left her was bad genes and them two children. - Tell me something, what do you think about interracial dating? - No, he's white, too. - No, no, this a hypothetical. I just had this couple in the cab today. - And they were interracial? - Yeah. Yeah, you know, they seemed nice and everything but they just had so many damn problems, you know? - I know. - Like when they got out of the cab, I tried to say something nice to them, they acted weird. - Don't tell me you told them they're gonna have beautiful children together? Oh God, please. - So how'd you know? - Every Liberal says that to an interracial couple. They must hear that shit twenty four seven. - I didn't mean anything by it. I just wanted to give them a vote of confidence. - Yeah, they need your vote of confidence like they need a bill on Capitol Hill. - No, I just wanted to. - What, let them know it was okay for them to be together? - No. - I done that, too, don't worry about it. - Yeah? - It's like, it's like you're trying to justify that you, to yourself, not to anyone else but yourself, that you are a civilized person. So you let them know that it is okay, by you, for them to be together, because you're civilized. Hey, Barnett? Do you need me right now? - [Barnett] Nah, I'm cool. - So what do you think about interracial dating? - This thing is really bothering you, isn't it? - It's not bothering me. I'm just sort of curious, you know? - Well, what you wanna know? Go ahead, talk to me. - I'm talking. - What you wanna know? - Do you approve of it? - For me? For other people? Who? What you? You have to be specific, what do you mean do I approve? Me, you, who? - For us. - William. I only date black men. And it's not because of the myth, 'cause I done see me some new dick white men and some jerk dick black men. - Whoa, wait a minute, I thought you said you didn't date white men. - I don't, I like porno. - Oh you. - Yeah? - Yeah. East coast or west? - Get outta here. - Come on. - I'm not telling. - I want you to tell me. - West, west. - West? - They have better production values, and more storyline. You? - East, east all the way. - Get outta here. - Get outta here, you, east is grittier and the tits are real. - Oh stop, William I know you like fake. - I don't like fake, I wanna see 'em jiggling and bouncing, come on. That west coast shit don't have no bounce to it at all. Come on. - You know what I like the best? I like the faces they make. Woo. Big turn on, big time. Mmmm. ♪ Living in the ghetto ♪ In the ghetto - Alright, so where were we? - The Affirmative Action hire. - That you want to veto. - Not veto, just table until we get more information. - Are you expecting a transmission from Mars? - That's very funny. I'm just saying we have a little time before we need to send in this brief. - Yes, we do. As a matter of fact, we're gonna finish early and this is the last item on our agenda, so I'm asking that we talk about affirmative action. Not as it pertains to the brief. - I think I know where this is going. - I think so, too. - You want to talk about an internal program again, don't you? - I do not, I want to talk about Affirmative Action. If that intern program should happen to come up. - See? - Really, I'm kidding. I just wanna know what you think. [hip hop music] - I think the white students don't know what to think. - And that's the fault of the African American students? - I didn't say that. What I am trying to get across is that black separatism causes psychological confusion in white students. - Go on. - When the African American kids keep to themselves, and in a lot of instances, celebrate their blackness, the white students, they find it hostile. They wonder what they've done to make the blacks, the African Americans stay away from them. - Okay, I understand your definition, but spin that thought around. Black students being black, talking black, dressing black, joking, whatever, are just black students being black. Why should white students be put off by that? Especially because white students are always together, being white, joking white, talking white, dressing white. - Look, I'm not casting blame. - Then what's your point? - Just that, Nicole please. What I am trying to do is just to point out a subtlety. - What about the subtleties African Americans encounter every day? Certain looks or off comments? I was counseling this one sophomore, a black student. - Who? - As a counselor, I can't tell you that. - Oh, I see. But, maybe as Miss Thompson, the math teacher, you can. - Right now, I'm talking to you as a counselor. - But you know what I've noticed? White men, they fantasize on this downward attraction thing, you know what I'm saying? They're attracted to what is considered dirtier, dark and exotic. And black men, in their minds, they aspire up. You know, they attracted to things like quote unquote the pure, the white, the clean and ritzier. - Now that sounds pretty stereotypical to me. - It's all generalizations, William, but there is some truth in there. - So you don't think that black men have bigger dicks? - Not unless you've been with more black men than I have. Oh, William, you play too, come on. - Nooo. Highschool, showering after practice. The football team, please. - I was about to say. - I'm the last of the Mohicans, you know that? - You got any class reunions coming up? - I ain't inviting you. - But you know what it is, William? When a black man used to get his thing together, would start making a lot of money, the first thing that he would do was go out and date a white woman, 'cause it was a status thing, ya know? And nowadays, I see those same white women paying for the brothers. You got Leon, the muffler repair man eating sushi a la carte with Megan, the dairy queen from Pennsylvania picking up the bill. - Yeah, I seen that, too. You know Megan is just rebelling against her parents because of some bullshit hypocrisy the fed her, because they couldn't put her in a better station in life. - And you know Megan's parents told her to stay away from the taboo black man. - That's the wrong thing to tell Megan. - Oh, Megan don't wanna hear that. - So, it's reasons like that that make you disapprove? - I didn't say I disapprove, it's just not for me. Maybe for other people, but it's not for me. I'll tell you what I do think is weird, though. When people don't date their own kind at all, now that shit is weird. That's some self hate. - Well you know, maybe, maybe it's just some kind of fetish. I mean, maybe, you know, there's people that just go for parts. Yeah, you know what I mean by parts is hair color, shoulders, legs, hands. - Skin is different. - Skin is not different. - It is so. - Skin is an external thing that people. - Oh, come on. Skin has different, it has a deeper meaning than that. Well, I think I better get back to my job. - Yeah, I gotta go, too. I got a date. With a white woman. Whoa. [hip hop music] - Curtain's closed. - Damn, we missed her, yo. - And then there are other blacks who are so angry that they don't ever even deal with Affirmative Action. They know that they can just work at McDonald's forever and never get anywhere. So they just wanna grab a shotgun and strike out at the first white guy who doesn't have something good to say about Mary and Barry's wardrobe. - What do you think about it? - Ta-shi-kis are okay, I wore one on a kibbutz once when I was dating this. - No, no, no, I mean what do you think about Affirmative Action? - Oh, well, some applications bother me. Like it's the last chance in the world that I'll ever get something for free. I mean there are support groups for Latins, blacks, gays, women, everybody. Nothing for good old fashioned white guys. - I think it's called the Republican Party. - See, just because the masters of the universe are members of my group, I'm thought of as someone who doesn't warrant assistance. - Don't you think that warranting assistance is just part of the American way? Take the special interests groups that help get presidents elected, or the tax code, capital gains, home interest. You are getting assistance, because it's not a God-given right to deduct interest on your homes. - You know, we like to think that we're the land of the free and the home of the brave, but that's not true. Really, we're the land of the chicken shit motherfuckers. You know, we like to say on the face of it how pro-equal opportunity we are, but we're not. And God help us if we could admit the truth. - Those guys in Congress, that put that stuff together? They're going home and they're fucking their wives just a little bit better 'cause they think they done something good for the world. - Throw corporations in there, too. They support some basketball player or some rapper idiot who sings all I need is a nine and a bitch. What the heck is that? A nine and a bitch? Yeah, that's insane that they're rolled out there as role models. If corporate sponsors had a clue, there would not be 13 per cent of the population buying 60 per cent of the sneakers. - No, see, I disagree. And you know why you don't know what nine and a bitch is? 'Cause you ain't never lived in a ghetto. I think the rappers are the best thing that could possibly have happened for African Americans. They have set us free, okay? You know why? 'Cause they don't give a fuck what white people think about 'em. They don't wanna be white, act white, they don't want white women, they are young, black warriors, they will die for what they believe in. I think it's refreshing. And that's why you don't like 'em. 'Cause you're scared of 'em, basically, 'cause they're not scared of you. - Look, there was a time in this great city where there was a schism. - A schism? - A schism. Unique to Brooklyn and Queens. It was the phenomenon of rock sucks versus disco sucks. Now everybody who was black, except for like the taped up Elvis Costello glasses brothers in the chess club felt that rock sucks. And on the other side, the white boys, now I don't mean white boys as a derogatory phrase, I mean boys of non-color, who for the most part, felt disco sucks. See, a lot of girls like to dance and you can't hustle to no Jethro Tull and shit. I mean the rhythm just don't work. And the phenomenon here is that the white boys started it. - You were there when it started? - Like Crispicus Attucks, the first man, a black man, to die in the Revolutionary War. Ironic shit, huh? I mean, they kidnapped the motherfucker, bring him over on some slave ship, give him a fucked up name like Crispicus and he gotta be the first motherfucker to die. But I digress. - Yes, you do. - What I'm saying is that the white boys made a comment about disco, you know? I mean they probably didn't even mean the shit as a personal front, 'cause a lot of motherfuckers hated disco back in the day. I mean, I bet Don Cornelius wanted that shit with Soul Train-worthy for awhile. But shoot, get down on the subtext of this shit. Now here's an oppressed people who are, what, ten years off the Civil Rights struggle getting cut down by their recent oppressors in regards to their taste in music. Now how that's gonna go over? A white boy breaking on a brother's music. - Peaches and Herbs shoulda been off limits, huh. - The one thing they acknowledged over all those slave years was taste in music. Then suddenly they're saying it sucks. Like Stevie Winwood is the motherfucking Amadeus and shit. Of course, black folks gonna get mad and say rock sucks in righteous retribution. - I'm running out of time here. - Ken, you ever see those Star Trek movies where they fly around the sun? - They did that in three and five, right? - Four, too, I think. - Yeah that's when they search for Spock's brain? - I can't remember. Yo, Vince? - I ain't no Trekkie. - It's Trekker. - Trekker, tractor, whatever, Solo. - It's Sulu, man. - I think the best one was two, though. - Oh yeah, the General Khan ending? - Yeah, Kirk. I will get you, Kirk. Vengeance is a dish best served cold, and it's very cold in space, Kirk. - Yeah, that was dope. - Vince, I thought you weren't a Trekker? - No, I just like that cat who played the villain. You know the guy I'm talking about, he was best friends with the midget on The Loveboat. He was the fucking man. - Nah, dude, that's Fantasy Island, man. - What the fuck is Fantasy Island? - Oh, man. - You don't remember? The midget, the plane, the plane. If it was The Loveboat, it would be the boat, the boat. Yo, what's wrong with you? - Damn, I thought they were the same show. I thought the boat was parked by the island. - Yo, anyway, you seen the one when they fight The Borg? - Nah, dude, that's the new cast. I'm saying in one of them, they fly around the sun and go back in time. - Yeah, right, right, right. - Yo, man, that shit is so cool. I mean I'd go back to like, old west days. Shoot my six guns, chew some beef jerky, roll with my sidekicks. - Yeah, sure, you can have that. - Aw, come on, Ken, you wouldn't wanna have a bar room brawl? - Man do you ever hear of black people wanna go back in time? Man, if I went back, I'd introduce those racist motherfuckers to some modern technology. - Word. - See here, boy, maybe you better get them city slicker clothes off and get out in that field and pick my cotton. - Hmm. You know, I think I'm taking the day off, boss. What do you think? - Oh, I think you oughta have a day off. - Oh. Shit, you know how they do on those fake history things, when they be like, well what if the Nazis got the bomb first? I'd be like what if Chicken George had a tank and all the ammo he needed to kick some cracker ass? - Maybe I can interest you in another time period? - Yo, ancient Egypt is about the only time I can think of when black people weren't getting mugged. - Egyptians were black? - Just because? - They're not now. - Then what are they? - Arabs? - Dark skinned people. Lou Gossett plays Sadat. - Who, who's that? - Anwar Sadat? He's like their best soccer player. - That was a movie, man? - I think it was an after school special Oliver Stone did. - I musta missed it. - Word. - Yeah. - So this student was very upset, he listed off about ten things that were bothering. - Is it Alton Wheeler? - Serious things, like home life, his job, his girlfriend, and he includes a story about a white student who used the word man at the end of each of his sentences. - Man? - Yeah, do you want to go to the park, man? - Interesting. - Well he was offended, because he felt like this student wouldn't use the word man at the end of each of his sentences if the white student was talking to another white student. - Interesting. - I thought so. - Malcolm James? - I don't know what Affirmative Action is. I'll tell you what Affirmative Action is, it's some money making motherfuckers that want more of my tax money. Why don't we just lower the transit fare if you're a minority? Except if you're an Asian, because we know they work twice as hard as any of us do. But enough about me. What do you think Affirmative Action is? - Politicians like to shake the trees. This way people don't think, and they don't see what's really going on. Affirmative action is just a way to lower the standards for people who really haven't worked hard enough in their lives. Now 120 years from now the very same white people who came up with these beneficial ideas are going to think of a new affirmative system, because they're gonna be poor. And maybe they're gonna call it WPA, like the new deal after The Depression. - Well now, see. I liken Affirmative Action to two women in a race and you put a ball and chain around one woman, alright? Fire the gun, start the race, then halfway through, you call time out and you take the ball and chain off of the woman. - And give her a motorcycle she doesn't really know how to use? - Now how you know she don't know how to use it? - Isn't that what Affirmative Action is? The spoils don't go to the better qualified. Viv, I'll tell you, I won't be held accountable for some great, great, great plantation relative with mutton chops and a big hat. - Mmhmm, you would if he was rich. You'd be talking about oh, yes, that's my rich relative and my family tree leads straight back to him. - You can't get back at dead people through the living. - What do you mean a multiplex community center? - I mean a multiplex community center. You know how the theaters are set up on the 4th street row, the different theaters and everything? - Yeah. - Well, I'm gonna do that in the community center tip, with like a, a different organization in each room. Wait, I'm gonna do something different, with like a focus on different needs. You get to decide where you wanna go. - First up, if it's like a multiplex, those rooms are way too small to set up anything. I mean, some of those rooms only hold like, 30 seats. - Who said I'm gonna need that much? - Hold on, hold on, and the second thing is, you wouldn't be near any hood if you made it to the pros. - First of all, I'm making it. Second, I ain't gonna switch after I make it. - Oh, come on, kid, you'd have mad girls, a condo, a Benz. - You see those Benzes? They're making 'em like fucking Fords. Now you see a Lexus, a Lexus, that's a car. - True, yeah. - But yo, man, you're gonna get too comfortable. I mean like endorsements, business deals, family. And you forget, I know you, you cut people off mad quick, so you're not gonna care about fuck ups in the hood. - I changed, alright. - Besides, say you got your little money or what not. You're not gonna go save the world. - Who says I'm trying to save the world? Brother's just trying to make a little community center, man. - If it was that easy, a bunch of pros would have made some consortium and go for it, did that already. - Can I talk now? - Go ahead, man, I wansn't. - Yo, can I talk now? - Go ahead, man. - So, like, the only reason it hasn't been done is 'cause there hasn't been any pros conscious enough to lead them. - Bullshit. - I don't see any cornrows in your head. - Like I was saying, I'll lead all the other pros, like an Oprah or somebody and we'll fight ignorance and poverty with the multiplex. - You been smelling way too much comic book ink, man. - What's this, oh shit, it's Super Black Man coming to a hood near you. - Oh shit, that was funny. - Besides, no one ever does that after they make it. I mean, even Doctor Huxtable doesn't do that. - Come on, man, Cosby Show isn't representative. - Why not? - It's like, too perfect. - Your family is like that. - My family is not like The Cosby Show. - Besides, if you're going back fight dealers, crack heads and tech tens, I mean you better get some Kevlar hip hop gear. - Yo, they make that shit? - Yup, seen it in a magazine. - Word? They have like bullet proof baggies? - I don't know, probably. - That's dope. Like, rappers should wear that shit. - Straight up, maybe Biggie still be alive. - Okay, okay, one more time. Keith Jarrett. Bad motherfucker, right? Own some of his albums myself. But, yo, I never knew he was a white man. - I didn't know that either. Didn't he have a big afro back in the day? - Fooled me, too. I mean, I suppose it's because in the time Red born white boys had afros, too. Now don't you suppose Keith cashed in on that? - How? - I bought this shit because he's black. - Yeah, but that's 'cause you were Afro-centric colored glass. - Ray Ban was a black man, baby. - Was he? - I don't know, sounds like it though. - And how do you account for white people like myself? My ancestors didn't come here until 40 years after slavery. And during slavery, they were getting killed in Poland. And it was only 40 years after they got here they were able to afford a tv set. They didn't own a plantation. The plantation for them was a two bedroom apartment in Forrest Hills. - But, white people are a race. And yesterday and today, being in that race has its privileges. - The White Card. Don't leave the guard-gate community without it. - I mean, really, even the subtle stuff like you walk into a retail store, you're above suspicion. My black man with dreads walks in, he's a thief. You go to a bank to get a loan, my black sisters can't get one, and she might be making more money than you. Sorry, baby, that white card you carry? That has privileges. My green card? I got to pay back on it every month. And I don't care what you say, no white person wants to be black. They don't want to trade places with us. Why would they? Oh, they, they wanna steal our shit and play our music and all that, act like us, them little wiggers, them little white kids that wanna act black. - Yeah, boy. - They talk the talk but they're not walking the walk. They don't really wanna be black. And you know what, they couldn't be. 'Cause it's not their experience. They just want to be Elvis. - I agree, there's still discrimination. - Enough to endorse a policy to that gives someone preferential treatment on the basis of skin color? - No. There's economic inequality on a large scale. 'Cause see, you're thinking Affirmative Action is a black thing, and it's not, it's a people thing. And that's a racist thing. - I'm a racist? My son Ken is black. - And I bet you say he's your best friend. - I've raised him to feel that way, yes. - You take these subtleties of African American students sitting together, or the use of the word man, they lead to these intense feelings? Now what about not so subtle factors? Like quotas on Affirmative Action? - Hmm. - Well Shelby Steele said that the blacks are paying a heavy price for these university letter acceptances that are based on lower academic achievement. - I knew you didn't believe in Affirmative Action. - Now, I didn't say that. - You believe that Affirmative Action will make us more competitive, I don't. - And I want Ken to succeed on his own. I know it's not a black thing, but if Affirmative Action gets him into Harvard, I wanna throw a party and live vicariously through him as if my shit smelled from ivy, because I know if he's in Harvard, his life is set. - There's more responsibility on the black athlete to give something back. - Man, that's that old thought that athletes who move out of the hood and into a nice neighborhood are selling out. And that ain't right. Did you know that when Jews first moved here, they lived in ghettos and they were like the best boxers around? - Yo, just don't even give me that great white hope jazz because there's plenty of white boxers, and if you dissolved hockey, there'd be plenty of them working for Don King. - Nah, what I'm saying is that Jews who own a bunch of shit these days were poor and had it rough when they came here. That's what made 'em the best boxers. - Because it was rough? - Yeah, like the kids you don't wanna fight now. - Yo, like Cedric. - Word. - Word. They're the ones who don't give a fuck. And if you look back on, like, Jewish and Irish immigration, you see that everyone moved out of their hoods after they got a little money together. And I think it was like same for everyone. I mean, that's like the dream, kid. America is all about of moving out of your neighborhood and into a nicer one, so like a future generation can have it better than the past. - Black people ain't moving up. George Jefferson was like the last poverty class black dude I seen moving on up. - And you're saying it's 'cause blacks aren't sticking together? - Not like white people. And definitely not like Koreans. - I can't argue about Koreans, but whites do not always stick together. - Come on, man, white people got solidarity down cold. - Yeah, whatever, let's bounce. All those white people are moving out of cities and going out to suburbs. And even suburbs aren't suburb enough for a lot of 'em right now. - No they're not, rent's like sky high here. - New York isn't everywhere, man. It's a blip on the screen. There's a whole fucking country out there. - Yeah I know, I visited this town in Oklahoma. - Yeah, I'd love to listen to your story, but I'm making a point here. - Stop. - What? - Nah, go ahead, man, it's your world. - Any fucking way, like I was saying, all those white people are headed for those guard gate communities, with their air horn enhanced golf courses and pools. - And it's to all to get away from African Americans? - Jews, Hasians, Japanese. - Hasians! - But mostly African Americans. - So? - So, dummy, whites won't be hanging out with African Americans. - Oh, like they do now? - Well, it's gonna be worse. - I don't think so. - Listen, you're not seeing my point here. All those white people moving out to the suburbs, it's gonna mess up context. - Nah, they're just gonna have bad football and basketball teams like they had back in the day. - Alright, I think I'm seeing you clearly now. You think I shouldn't deal with the white point of view in my speech. - Hallelujah. The brother has reached the mountain top. I mean, it what program or piece of literature do they include our perspectives? TV? We're mostly pimps and prostitutes. Film? We never live through the first act. Next time you in the movies, see if you finish your popcorn before the costarring brother gets offed. Shit. I'm surprised you're here talking to me now. ♪ Amazing Grace - It's gotta be both sides. - Yeah, well you go forth with that olive branch, it might get stuck up your ass. - What's up? - [Male In Blue Shirt Voiceover] Why does he say what's up to every black guy who walks by? - What? - Nothing, this is the place, isn't it? - Yeah, you're gonna love the organic chitlins. - I'm sorry, we're not open yet, but please, come back later. - Okay. - Come on. - Gotta go. - Hey, hey, hey. Tell me that the NBA's elimination of the slam-dunk championship isn't a plan to decentralize the street aspect of the game? - Brother, I love a good conspiracy theory, too. - Falling on their side again. - I'm not, don't do that, man. I'm a black man, too. But listen, listen. Couple years ago I'm having Thanksgiving with my girlfriend's parents, right, and they almost start a riot 'cause I tell them back in the 40s black men were injected with syphilis as part of a government experiment. - Hasn't history taught you not to have Thanksgiving with the Pilgrims? [banjo music] - Thanks, Mustafa. - Alright, but I'm telling you, if you wanna do the best good for both sides, stay black, brother. - Alright. - Hey, yo, man, you want some organic chitlins? Take a second, I just got 'em in. I'm telling, you, Mike, them shits is good. - Hey, brother. - Alright. My, my. Hey, Sharon, I'm going out for awhile, I'll be back soon. - Salaam alaikum. - Walaikum salam. - Ever notice how the check goes to the white guy? - What? - At a restaurant, the check always goes to the white guy. Know what I mean? - Naw, man, I have no idea what you talking about. - You know, you remember when we was at the restaurant, and they gave the check to you, even though I asked for it? I mean, like, a cheque never goes to a brother. - What, man, they put the check right in the middle of the table, yo. - But it was pointed towards you. - It was a piece of paper. It wasn't pointing, it was just chilling. - And who did he ID, thank you very much? - Oh man, get outta here. - It was a coincidence. The check was in the middle of the fucking table. - You think a waiter would risk a tip just to insult you? - Oh, racism isn't profitable. - I don't know, there's a lot of good money in cheese. - That's so fucking ignorant, yo. - Where's your sense of humor? - Y'all left it in Alabama. - Yeah, everyone's out to get you. - I'll tell you what it is, it's like a statement. Man I can't pay for my own check, or I'm some white guy's charity. - Oh man, whatever, yo, you buggin'. Ready to go back to school? - Nah, I gotta go to my dad's office, get some money for that class trip. See you there later. - Cool. Think you could hit me off? - Yo, don't you owe me ten bucks, yo? [guitar music] - You know, I could deal with it if it was like a black white thing, but this is a man woman thing. Two guys from the, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hey, Kenny, how you doing? - I'm fine, and you? - I'm doing pretty good. I'll get your father. Let's see, I think he's still in a meeting. Yeah, hi, your son is here. Okay. He says he'll be out in a second. - So how's it going? - You really wanna know? - Go ahead. - Do you know that I doubled majored at? - Excuse me, sweetie, I think you can take a break from your dating schedule here and free my triathlon application, please. - Sure, excuse me. Excuse me for a moment. Here you go. - Hi, son. - Dad. - Veronica doesn't think it's uncool for you to hug me, do you, Veronica? - No, not half as uncool as that outfit you're wearing. It's not very GQ today, is it? - It's not? - No. - Oh, my feelings are hurt. What do you mean, I saw it in the magazine right here. - Well, if you let me buy some new magazines, you might get a current wardrobe. - Oh, touche. - Ma let you go out of the house like that? - Yeah, ma let me come out of the house like that. What's, what's, alright? What's going on, you alright? - Can we go talk over there? - You sure, everything alright? - Yeah, yeah. - Alright. - Bye, Veronica. - Bye, Kenny, it was good to see you again. - So what's up? - I just need a buck fifty for that class trip deal. - Hundred fifty? - Mmhmm. - Hi, this is my son, Ken. You remember Ken? - Hey. - That's Viv and Rich. - Haven't seen y'all in awhile, what's up? - How you doing? - I'm alright, going to school, you know, I have to get back soon. - He's doing very well. - Is he? - Yes, he is. - You're taller than your father now. - Well. - That ain't hard. - That's why I'm holding him. See you, see you in a little while, alright? - Bye bye. - Bye, Ken. - So you wouldn't get Sharisse a Barbie? - Never. - Because you don't want her to grow up and idolize Cindy Crawford or anyone like that? - No, because I, I don't think you'd really understand the issues. - Believe it or not, I've been understanding these issues all morning and I think I'm very qualified to go wherever you want to on this. - Really? - What'd you do this morning. - Don't ask. Come on. - What I know is that society puts a lot of pressure on little black girls to look a certain way that they can never look. They're little black girls, they're not little white girls. - Sharisse is beautiful. - Well I know that. You know I know that. But, she doesn't have any icons to look up to, really. I mean, all the icons are white Europeans. And if you really think about what society considers beautiful, it's not my people. It's not her people. It's my white ancestors on my mother's side. And little black girls wanna be attractive. - She discover boys yet? - Well she has discovered Plymouth Rock, but I'm not letting her get off the boat. - So you're afraid that what, when that time comes, she's gonna wanna color her hair blond or something? - I don't know, I hope not. It would hurt me if she wanted to do that. But it doesn't even have to be that drastic. Just straightening has an effect. - White women bleach their hair all the time. - White women bleach their hair to look like white women. Why should a black woman bleach her hair to look like a white woman? Or straighten her hair to look like a white woman? I mean, why can't we be beautiful as black women? - There are Latina Barbies. - Nah, they're just white Barbies dipped in chocolate, they got no hips, lips or nose. - Sorry, guys. - So how's Ken? - Oh he's fine, it's just a little money matter. - Isn't it always? - Yeah, I wish there was a flat rate with kids, right? - Tell me about it, Sherisse is growing so fast I think it'd be cost-effective for me to have another one. - Suppose it's a boy? - Then I hope he don't mind cross-dressing. - So, listen, what do you guys think about my outfit? - Not bad. - Not bad if you're running a casino in Connecticut. [laughing] - It's not that funny. - Come on, now, don't you think Affirmative Action draws attention to race? It elevates the myth of the black stereotype? - My. No please. - Kielbasa! - White middle class values should not determine what black students should learn. - Oh, so, then asking a black inner city student a question like what do you feed a baby cow, that's unfair? Oh, okay, if that's so then asking a white, suburban student about sewer caps is unfair? - Can we table this now? - Oh yeah, hey, I'm satisfied. I asked for what you felt, and you told me. - Yeah, but I hope that you weren't taping this to, you know, bring some sort of a racial class suit against us. - Would you like to check me for wires? - No. - That's sexual harassment. - You guys are just uptight white boys. - Just a sign of the times. - I'm gonna step out for awhile. Okay, I'll be back later. - Okay. - I'll be back later, Veronica. - Oh, hold on a second. Here you go. - Thanks, I'll bring you a cappuccino. - Great, have a good day. [romantic music] [upbeat music] - Hi, I'm here to see Nicole Thompson. It's not urgent, so if she has a class or something? - No, actually she's talking to the Principal down the hall in room 222. Just through that corridor. - Thank you. - What are we gonna do about the problem we're going through right now? You got any ideas? - No, I mean I think it's our job as administration to try and work it out, work out. - I wonder if we could just sort of attack these subtleties, you know? Make them overt. Bring them to light, maybe that will get rid of a lot of this misunderstanding. - I don't think we can eliminate the problem of subtlety itself. Maybe certain instances, like the use of the word man, will be brought out into the open, but there's always gonna be subtleties, because of the murky nature of the human mind. - Well, that's interesting. - Take, for example, you and me. As I listen to you, I'm scanning you, and each time you say interesting, I make a silent assessment. - Aren't they there? - I think they're busy. Can I just wait over here? - Yeah. - Do I say interesting a lot? - Yes. And each time you do, I make a judgment. Does he mean interesting as in he thinks I'm full of shit? Interesting as in interesting? Interesting as in I never thought of that before? Interesting, I'll have the seafood salad today. - That's interesting. - Good afternoon, look at that beautiful sister behind the desk. I'm here to see my friend Michael, he's speaking this afternoon. My name is Mustafa, I'll just see my way in, don't move. - Excuse me, who? - Michael, my friend Michael is speaking in the auditorium, I'll just find my way in. - I don't know your friend Michael and I don't know about a speech. - Okay, my friend Michael, he's speaking in the auditorium. - Yeah, I heard that. - I'll just find my way in, it's fine. - No, um, what's your name? - Mustafa. My name is Mustafa. - Well, Mister Mustafa, I don't have your name here on my list, so can you have a seat and wait for your friend Michael to come out, if he's in there? - Yeah, alright. - Okay. - Well, if you're right about these subtleties, then I guess there's not much hope for a continued understanding. - Well let's not walk away from hope too quickly. [bell ringing] - Hey man. Hey, Michael Gray, I'm here speaking for the assembly with Miss Thompson. [hip hop music] - So today's guest speaker is Michael Gray. He's a freelance writer for several major magazines and he'll be addressing the topic of race. Let's welcome him. [applause] - Honkeys. Niggers. Spics. Kikes. Wops. Wetbacks. Frogs. Krauts. Chinks. Dotheads. Gooks, Polacks and mixed. Greetings. Now. Don't sit back or get comfortable. Move to the edge of your seat and get ready, 'cause this isn't gonna be any speech. No. Not letting you off that easy. If we're gonna deal with race, we're gonna deal with it the best way I know how. We're gonna talk about it. So instead of 80 per cent speech and 20 per cent question and answer, it's gonna be the other way around. And first, I'm gonna tell you a little story. Once upon a time, there was a young man driving his horse and carriage down a narrow road, barely wide enough for a Yugo. Now the young man was an orphan, never knew his father. But that didn't deter him from being a good man. So he's driving down this road, right? And then comes this old man. The old man had no son, or so he thought. But not having a son didn't stop him from being a good man. So what do you think happened when these two good men meet on this old, narrow road barely wide enough to fit a Yugo? The good men get into an argument about which good man should back up and let the other good man get by. Then the young good man, being young and in a rush to make a booty call, picks up a stone from the side of the old, narrow road barely wide enough to fit a Yugo and bop! Hits the old good man on his vulnerable, old head, killing the old man. - That's messed up. - Word. - Now some of you may think that's just another story about road rage, and you'd be right. But some of you may also see it as the beginning of the Greek myth Oedipus Rex, where the young man unknowingly kills his dad. Tell me, do you think the good young man would have killed, hit or even raised a rock to the good old man if he knew it was his good old missing dad? Of course not. My point. Get to know the man. Let's talk. ["Right Here" by Loris Holland] [upbeat music]
