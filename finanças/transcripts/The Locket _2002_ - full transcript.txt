Are those picturesof your family? Sorry. Just tryingto make conversation. I was quite beautiful once. Thank you. For what? For not saying,"And you still are." Do you know how oftenpeople say that? It's so ridiculous. It's patronizing. I'll try to remember that. Tell your friends. I will. No, you won't. It was a pleasure to meet you. Okay. Just do it. Hey, looks like yougot the job. Yeah.Lucky for me. It's lucky for us. Michael how'd it go with Esther? She's tough. Yes. She needs to getout of her room. Maybe you couldtake her outside and walk with her sometimes. Sure. You like garlic,don't you? Do I like garlic. I thought I'd do a basicspaghetti sauce. Just pep it up a bit. That sounds good. Or we could just havea big bowl of okra. Okra? Yeah, don't you remember? That's how we met. When I was workinghere, you mean? Yes, but it was becauseof the okra. You don't rememberthat part? Huh-uh. The store was havinga big sale on okra and I asked you howto cook it and you saidyou had no idea. Well, that sounds right. Most guys wouldhave tried to fake that. But you, you wentand got that cardfrom somewhere and it had all the recipesand all the instructions. Everything you ever wantedto know about okra. I still have it. You do? Yeah, it was the first thingyou gave me. I remember talking to you. And then wanting to keep talking. You weresoearnest and helpful. You were goingto leave and you turned backto ask me something. Oh, yeah, I remember. It was, like, "How much okra "do you think I need? You know, just for myself?" And then you said "Three or four..." Three or four pounds. I'd still be eating it. I came backthe very next day. Yeah. And that's whenI asked you out. I don't remember whyyou came back, though. Well, it wasn'tfor more okra. Veterans Hospital, Neal. It's okay, Henry. You're just goingto the doctor. You'll be backin time for lunch. I can hardly wait. His physician's nameis Dr. Heath, Michael. Okay, thanks. Helen, hold up. Oh, goodness.Hold on. Can't forget that. Henry's being a littleuncooperative today. Do you know if he's hada fall recently? I don't know. But he's kind of unsteadyon that crutch. Not that unsteady. And not deaf, either. He has a bad bruiseon his back and with that cough,it's very uncomfortable. I prescribedthis new medication. Here's some samplesto get him started. Okay. Please tell Helento let me know if there's any change. Yeah, I will. Thanks again,Dr. Heath. Yeah, sure. Okay, here we go,Henry. Oh, hold on, just let meget the brakes on. So, should I callthe pharmacy about these newprescriptions? Actually, I'll do that. One of my many chores. Dr. Heath did give mesome samples. Maybe we can get him startedon these. Yeah, sure.Give him a couple and I'll take the rest. Put them away. Okay, there you go. Thanks. Mm-hmm.Good luck. Okay, Henry,this should help. Would you likeyour glass of juice? They don't have glasses. They have plastic cups. But, yes, please. Put it on the table. There you go. Thank you. You're welcome. You're still here. Working here, I mean. That surprises you? When you didn't come byfor the sheets I thought... you'd moved on. I had to take someoneto the hospital this morning-- Henry. Do you know him? Henry? Of course. He was a soldier. Did he tell you that? No. Hardly said anything at all. In the second world war. He was wounded in France. Watch your step. Sorry. If it were simply amatter of financial need there'd beno question. And your academic records in the two yearsthat you've completed were outstanding. You certainly qualifyon that basis. Our concern is about your lackof extracurricular activities. We expect therecipient of a presidentialscholarship to try to better the community. I wish I'd been able to. I've been working after schoolsince I was 15. Then as my mother'shealth deteriorated I... I wasforced to leave college to care for her. Which raises a much more serious objectionto your candidacy. How do we knowyou won't dropout again? I give you my word. Yes, well,we'd all liketo accept that but as trusteesof this foundation what guaranteecan you give us as to yourintentions? Well, my mother can't die again. I guaranteeyou that. Any more questions for Mr. Keddington? Thank you, Michael. We'll let you know. I don't know, I guessit went okay. Except for that comment. Maybe even that was okay. I mean, Dean Scott,the head of the committee she winked at mewhen I was leaving. Oh, she must like you. No, Faye, don't worry. She's not my type. It's all set, Mom. We've already gotthe turkey ordered. It's so niceto get outside. Michael! Hey. Hi. Hi. Esther, thisis Faye Murrow. Faye, this is Esther Huish. Hello. I'm pleasedto meet you. I hope you don't mind. I just wasin the area. I thought I'd seewhere my boyfriend works. Would you liketo walk with us? Sure. Are you cold? Oh, no. I should havebrought my scarf. Would you liketo go back in? No, thank you. I'll run back inand get it for you. Oh, that... that would be nice. Faye, do you mind? Be right back. Don't worry,I won't run away. There's a benchover there. Would you liketo sit down? All right... if you'll sit with me. Okay, I can do that. I sense somethingin Michael. A kind of melancholy. His motherdied recently. Maybe that's why. That would explain it. Just a few weeks ago. It's good he hasyou then. You got her outside. It's reallybeautiful here. Here we are,Esther. Thank you. You're very welcome. Michael, would you mindif I just sat here for awhile by myself? No, thatwould be fine. Um, we'll be backin a few minutes. Take your time. It was niceto meet you. Yes, dear, it has been nice. So, Faye,what's going on? I just got acceptedto UCLA medical school. When didyou find out? Just now, this morning. Oh, Michael, UCLA! That was my first choice. Is it okaythat I came here? 'Cause I didn't wantto wait to tell you. Sure, of course.Are you kidding? Good for you. There's a catch though. My acceptance is conditional on my completingthese two advanced courses. So? Well, they'renot offered here and I checked--I can take them out there transferall the credits graduate on time,all of that. Well, when would you go? January. Oh. That's the only waythat I could start with my class in the fall. You knew I was goingto go somewhere. Sure. Just so sudden. We have a month. I'm coming backfor the summer. Faye, I'm really happy for you. It's wonderful news. So, Faye, you mustbe so excited. And it's all so sudden. You're really leavingfor UCLA next month? Uh, next week,actually. It's just fora few days. Yeah. There wasn't anydorm space available so we've got to lookfor a place for Faye to live. It's a tough schoolto get into, I hear. I guess it doesn't hurt to have a professorfor a dad. It didn't hurt thatshe was the smartest girl in the school either. Imagine, our Faye isgoing to be a doctor. We're all so proudof you, honey. Now, some of youmay not know this but Michael here is also in the medicalprofession. Really? He's working as a nurse. Well, as a nurse's aideto be precise. It's just temporary. I think that Faye and Michael should just get married and move to Californiatogether. Well, I think they should. Abby, dear, it's notpolite to tell other peoplewhat they should do. Well, why? You and Daddy do it all the time. Man, I can'tbelieve this. Problem? Uh, yeah, Helen. Has me on for Christmas Eve--the late shift. You have a family thingto go to? Ooh, muchbetter than that. Big party. Well, I could fill in for you. I mean, everyone's justgoing to be sleeping. Really? You don't have somethinggoing on with your girlfriend? No. No plans. I'd be happy to. That would be... ...absolutely fantastic. You know, I have peopleexpecting me there. Well, you'd better notmiss it then. I'll tell Helento put me down. Well, thank you. Yeah. Do you want to go to lunch? I mean, I knowit's not much but at least let mebuy you a sandwich. All day with the oldreally gets to me. Do you notice howthey never laugh? They just complain. They don'tall complain. Yeah, some don'tdo anything. They're the worst. Hi, Alice.Hey. Like that Estherthat you walk with-- what a case. I've been theretwo years and I don't thinkshe's said tenwords to me. Hmm, well, shetalks to me. A little. Lucky you. Here you go, Alice. Thanks. So how'd you wind upat Whitewood? My dad. Thought I neededtime in the trenches. You don't know. My dad is Starly Richards. He's head of the State Office of SocialWelfare Services. Yeah. I'm being groomedfor a management job. Wow. Like Helen's. Oh, higher than that, I hope. Anyhow, how's your girlfriend? She sailing offto med school soon, huh? Mm-hmm. UCLA. Wow. She's really gorgeous. She is goingto cut a swath right throughthose young interns. Oh, I mean... if it weren't for you she would. Come here. Hey, baby. Welcome home. So tell me,what's it like? Oh, it's a bungalow. And it's gotlots of room and there's no armoires. Real closets, and... Oh, there's even a fireplace. You're going to love it. It sounds great. So, are you hungry? I could fix you something. Naw.I don't want to get spoiled. I like to spoil you. What do you thinkof oyster stew? You want to makeoyster stew? Oh, no, not tonight. It's for Christmas Eve. We always have some sortof fish thing on Christmas Eve. We're justtrying to decide. I'm working the late shiftChristmas Eve. You're working? Can you get out of it? Actually, I volunteered. Why? I mean, you knew we'dbe doing something. Uh, to be honest, Faye it's my first Christmaswithout Mom. And uh... I just felt like I needed to bewith the people at Whitewood who aren't with their families. Hey... Let's spendChristmas Day together. Just... the two of us. Make it a special day. But I already promisedthe sorority that I'd helpthem distribute gifts to the needyon Christmas Day. Well, I can help. Sure. Fine decorating party. Esther's upstairsand you're out here. Why don't you come inand help us decorate, Henry. I wasn't invited. Everyone's invited. Nobody said anythingto me about it. Well, I'm askingyou right now. Okay, Henry, why don'twe sit down on the lovely blue one. These lights don't work. Oh, Diane, the reasonthe lights don't work is you've gotto test the bulbs. That's right, Molly. Actually, why don'tyou help Diane with that. Peggy. Peggy, hey, maybe weshouldn't eat the popcorn. It's probablya little stale. Last year,Henry ate it all. I didn't get any. I'll help. Henry, you all right? Can't you give hima pill or something? Michael, these lightsstill aren't working. Okay, uh... Michael, you havea phone call. It's Jack Murrow. Uh, can... can you gethis number and I'll call him back. Yeah, I can do that. You... you tried to shut me up. They all tried to shut me up. Oops. Hi. Good.Glad you could make it. Mr. Murrow.

So, uh, Faye tells me you're up forthe Presidential Scholarship. Yeah, yeah, we'll see. That is great. Education is the key. Yeah. Michael, I wantto ask you a question. How do you feel about Faye? I love her. I'm glad to hear you say that because it tells me thatyou want the best for Faye. Well, of course. Michael Faye is fondof you. She wants the best for you, too. And I knowthat she agrees that this is the time for you kids to concentrateon your education. And I think it's time for youto exit the relationship. You seem very low today. I'm just a little preoccupied. I had a meetingwith Faye's father. Oh, what did he want? He wastalking about how I shouldstay out of Faye's way and we both needto focus on our education and not rush into anything. I don't know. Maybe a lotof what he said made sense. How so? I don't wantto get in Faye's way. I don't want to hold her back. Maybe I should justlet her focus on school. Oh, he's tryingto make you feel guilty for loving Faye. You trust your feelings. Love like that is so precious. I know. Talking about Thomas? I... How do you know that name? Have you beenreading my letters? Well, no, of course not. You've been prying. You haveno right to pry into my life. It was on the locket, Esther... No, no,no, no. No right! You have no right. Esther... come on. The party's started. I don't feel like a party.

I was just tryingto be realisticabout everything. Sometimes that's exactlythe wrong thing to be. You have to talk to herbefore she leaves. That won't changeanything. Do you think life givesus second chances? Probably make the samemistakes all over again. I don't know. I've never seen 'emin my life. Oh, yeah. In my bureauin the bottom drawer there's a box. Could you open it, please? Look inside. That's the guyin your locket-- Thomas. Thomas. All these are from you. I've been writingto Thomas for 45 years. But... I never sent them. There's something else. Now, if you havethe time... I'd like youto see this. That's the Betheltownboarding house. I went to work therewhen I was 16 after my parents died. Is that you? Yeah. The day I married Frank,my first husband. You were so... Young, yeah. That's Matthew. Our son. He was mentally handicapped. That must have been hard. Yeah. Frank never accepted him. He blamed me. He was a drinker. And violent, too. I'm sorry. We got married beforeI knew any of this. After a year,he abandoned us and went to Nevada. I heard he was killedin a fight. But he left me some money which I used to buythe boarding house. Oh, my. Thomas? Thomas. He came to look for gold. But he wasn't like the others. How so? Oh, the miners were a rough bunch, mostly. Thomas was kind. Matthew loved him. Yeah, youcan tell. After a few months,he spent more time helping me with the boarding housethan prospecting. I was drawn to him,of course, but something frightened me. Well, after yourfirst husband. Yeah. He hurt me badly. This is during the war? Right at the beginningof the Korean war. After his training,Thomas came backfor a few days before he was sent overseas. He was very sweet. But... then one afternoon he said hehad a surprise for me. That's your locket. The locket. "Always Thomas." I'll never forgetwhat he said. "I came here to find gold,and I believe I found it." He said he loved me,asked me to marry him. Asked me to wait for him. But... You turned him down. Yeah. Oh, I don't know. I still don't know. I was afraid. I knew he was going away and if he didn't come back,couldn't face the pain. That would be too hard. But you loved him. More than I knew. Left in the morningbefore I got up. Then I knew I'd madea terrible mistake. But it was too late. He was gone. Hello. Hey, Abby, It's Michael. Ooh, Michael. Listen, Faye'sleaving early the day after tomorrow. You've got to get down hereand talk to her. No... Abby? Hello? Listen, I thoughtwe agreed that that sortof emotional distraction was the last thingFaye needed right now. Can I just talk to her? No, I'm sorry. She doesn't wishto speak with you. Mr. Murrow, I'd just liketo speak with her, please. Good-bye, Michael. So did you getto talk to her? No. I tried. Give her time. She's leaving tomorrow. I can't stop her. Her father won't evenlet me talk to her. I'm beginning to hate him just as muchas my own father. Tell meabout your father. He was a drunk. He made my mother and Imiserable for 15 years and then he walked out. Never saw him again. I hated him. And yet...and yet when he left... it was awful. Oh, maybe you didn'thate him after all. Oh, yes, I did. I still do. What about Thomas?Did he survive the war? Yep, but I didn't know it. I wrote to himfor two yearscare of the army. I never heard back,then I got married again. Really? Not for love.For loneliness. And for help. An older man,a nice man. That summer...the war ended. I was doing the dishes Matthew came running "Tom, Tom, Tom!" There he was,standing at the gate. We sat down,had some lemonade. Took me a good hourto tell him I was married. When I did,something seemed to die in him. What did you do? Nothing I could do. Five years later my husband diedof a heart attack. Then I went looking for Thomas. Did you find him? Found his house. Little girl was playingoutside. Asked her name. "Katie. Katie." Asked her daddy's name. "Mr. Tom Ricorsi." And her mother came out smiling. I said, "I havethe wrong street" and I drove home. Wrote my first letterto Thomas that day but I never sent it. Could never break upthat family. That winter Matthew died. He got polio. I've been alone ever since. But I never stopped hopingI might see Thomas again. So there's no listing for a Thomas Ricorsianywhere in the state? No, sir. There is no listing. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Faye. Oh, no. It's all right. Hi. I needed to see you. Michael, please. Listen, listen. I got the scholarship. Oh, that's wonderful. Really. Congratulations. Listen, hey I know why you've beenavoiding me, okay? It's just beenso complex. No... Michael, it's not. You want a guaranteeeverything's goingto be perfect. I can't give thatto you. I think I was willingto take that risk but you weren't. I'll always love you. Your attention, please. We are ready to begin boardingFlight 931 with nonstop service to Los AngelesInternational Airport. Hey. Thanks for coveringfor me the other night. Yeah. Are you okay? Couldn't be better. Well... maybe a little better. Aw, what, did yourgirl go off to play doctor? Something like that. You got any plansfor New Year's? Because I knowa party. Uh, I don't think so. Okay. Sure. I mean, staying home... alone... brooding... definitely has its appeal,I guess. Actually, I was thinkingabout coming here and banging bedpans. Cute. Come on,it's a party. You know fun party?

No. No. Maybe that's anotherone of those it-isn't-meant-to-be. I don't know. Maybe we're all just prisonersof circumstance. What if you hadn't had a child? Or the war hadn't come? Or if my mother hadn'thad cancer? My father... had been a father? Thing's might have beendifferent, but they aren't. There's just nothingwe can do about that. No, you're wrong. There is something you can do. And you must. Can't give up Faye and you cannot useyour father as an excuse for all the bad thingsin your life. You have to forgive him. How can you say that? I don't owe him a thing. You owe it to yourself. You don't know whatyou're talking about, all right? You want meto forgive him. After what he didto me and my mom... I will never forgive him. Deciding to forgive is the first steptoward healing. Your anger is hurting you,not him. You haveto let it go. Listen, you have no rightto lecture me, all right?!

You have a bail hearingin ten minutes. Um, I see you haveseveral priors: a DUI and three drunkand disorderlies. What? What are youtalking about? It's here on your record. That's not me. It's your name,and isn't this your address? That's my father. He uses that addresssometimes. It's probably the only onehe can remember. Are you readyto post bail at this time? Your Honor, my clienthas insufficient collateral to obtain a bond. As the sole caretakerfor his late mother he was forced to depletehis personal finances. I request that he be releasedon his own recognizance. On what basis? He's lived here all his life. He poses no flight risk and he has no historyof violence. But he does havea number of priors,Your Honor. No, he doesn't. Those records referto my client's father. The prosecution is so eagerto convict they didn't botherto check the date of birth. Our mistake,Your Honor. Even so, this isa very serious charge. Agreed. Does your client haveany personal references? Yes. My client was just awardedthe Presidential Scholarship at the university. It's very prestigious. All right.Request is granted until a trial date is set. In the meantime, Mr. Keddington your employment atthe Whitewood facilityhas been suspended. You're not to gowithin a hundred yards of Whitewood. Yeah? Hello, Michael?Dean Scott here. I'm very sorry to haveto tell you this but in viewof your current situation the committee has suspendedyour scholarship pending a full determinationof the facts. I hope you understand. Yeah, sure, I understand. Again, I'm so sorry. Good luck. Oh, dear. I've been so worriedfor you. I need to apologize. The last time Iwas here, I was... What I said was unfair. I'm sorry. I upset you, I know that. No need to dwell on it. This accusationis just terrible but you'll be exonerated. I know it. You must have faith. In what? Michael you can't be here. I know. I... I believe in you. Why are you doing this? Why are you setting me up? That is ridiculous. I mean, who would believe that? I believe that. You need to get out of here. Now! You need to leave me alone!Go! This is all going tocome down on your head. Amanda, hi.Hi. I didn't know youmade house calls. Don't get used to it. I got to sit down. Yeah. Come on over herein the dining room. Well, you didn't help yourselfany with your little stunt. Now Alice is askingfor a restraining order. Says you're stalking her. Yeah, well, you know,I didn't go thereto see her. Anyway, that's notwhy I'm here. Something's come up. Now what? I talked to Alice Richards'father. He doesn't relishin the publicity this caseis going to bring. He wants the publicto have confidence that state-licensedfacilities, such asWhitewood, are safe. I suspect he may be tryingto save his job or possibly his daughter, but... I think he might be pressuringthe D.A. to offer you a deal. What kind of a deal? Plead guilty to a lesser charge. Battery. You'll dominimum jail time-- possibly a year. But why would I plead guiltyto anything? I mean, I didn't hit him. I can't tell youwhat to do, Michael. I can only offeryou the choices. There's got to be something elsewe can do. Sure. We go to trialand take our chances. If they convict you're looking atten to 15 years. I'd think about the deal. It might bethe best way. You really needto eat something. Keep yourstrength up. Please. I'm not hungry. I shouldn't have allowed youto go see Thomas. I'm sorry. I don't regret it. Well, I do. I got my second chance. I'm sorry about this but I can't let anybodysee you here. She's failing. I thought a visit from youmight make a difference. Of course. Go on in. Oh... Hi. Esther, Helen saysyou're not feeling well. I know. That'snot important. Tell me about yourself. Has anything happened? Kind of. Um... The powers that be... they don't wantany bad publicity. They don't evenwant a trial. So they offered tolet me off reallyeasy if... if I admit I'm guilty. But you're not guilty. Should you do that? I don't want to spend therest of my life in jail. Won't it follow you forever? I don't care whatother people think. But it's notwhat other people think. It's what you thinkof yourself. Your self-respect. Self-respect. That walked out thedoor ten years ago. I-I could barelyeven post bail because of my father. The police dug up...Please stop. The police dug upa punch of old drunk arrests...Michael... And they thinkthey were mine because of my name.I just don't want to think abouthim anymore! Stop, stop. You know, your hatredfor your father is just like I waswith my first husband. But you know, Frank didlove me in his own way. It was good for meand Matthew that he left. I think he knewit was better he went. Of course,I didn't know that then. I grew bitter. Kind of a protective shell. Mmm. Old age gives perspective. If I hadn't married Frank I'd never have been blessedwith my Matthew. Well, look whatthe cat dragged in. Hi. Hi, it is. High time, some might say. You coming in or you just passing by? I can't lend you any money. Let's get that straight. I... I don't need money.Well, good. How about a drink then? What can I get you? Nothing. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. It's not money,it's not booze... To what do I owe this honor? Things have-have been... Yeah, "things," right. Hey, you can relax. I know all about it. Getting competitivewith your old man. Oh, yeah, I had a few write-upsin my day. Nothing like this, though. Front page,very impressive. So... did you do it? No. Well, anyway,it's very impressive. Drugs, murder... I hope you got a good lawyer. I do. Public Defender? Yes. Better hope they offer youa deal. That's the best way out if youcan't afford a fancy lawyer. Don't fight them, Mikey. People like us never win. Yeah. Tell your lawyerto get you a deal. Got to be realistic. I always told you that. You sure I can't get youa drink? No. What's the matter? You don't want to drinkwith your old man? I don't drink. Oh, of course. You think that, uh... you'll turn into me, is that...is that it? No. I'll never be like you. That's right. You're not a killer,not a drinker. You take after your mother. But you always did. So, uh... how is she? You don't know? What don't I know? She died. When? October. Well...why didn't you tell me? I thought you knew. Well, how was I supposed to know? I assumed you knew. You assumed what? That I knew? Or you assumed that I was drunk and unconsciousin a ditch somewhere? I loved her, Mikey. You knew that. October?! I don't even remember October! Hi Hi. Hi. Ma Hi. Mand Hi. Mandy Ib Hi. Mandy Ibar Hi. Mandy Ibarra Hi. Mandy Ibarrare Hi. Mandy Ibarraretu Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturn Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturnin Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturning fo Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturning for Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturning for Pa Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturning for Palm Hi. Mandy Ibarrareturning for Palmer. Just a second. Hello?Hi. You got an answer?No, I don't have an answer yet. Clock's ticking.Well, I understand that but you're going... Actually, hold on one second--I see him right now. Hi.It's the D.A.'s office. They say they're going to withdraw their offerunless... That's fine.I want a trial. no deal. No deal?We'll see you in court. You think I'm crazy? Maybe a little. But I also thinkyou're innocent. Can I ask yousomething? Sure. When's your baby due? Oh, March. And you'restill working? Well, I believe in trying to make the worlda better place. Still got a few thingsto do before the kid gets here.Hmm. And we will further demonstratethat the accused had been stealing prescriptiondrugs from the victim. And when Mr. McCord objected the accused beat...Mr. McCord... to death. And a little later,we checked in Michael's locker and there was a plastic bag of pillsin the pocket of his work clothes. And what werethose pills? Oxycodone. It's a painkiller. A narcotic. And did Henry McCord have a prescriptionfor Oxycodone? Yes. And then I saw him gointo Henry's room. And I heard Henry cry out. When I went to investigate...Michael was standing over Henry and Henry's crutchwas in his hand. A couple days later,Michael came to the Whitewood... and he threatened to kill me if I told anyonewhat I had seen. Ah. Hello, dear. Esther... when did youlast eat? I don't eat. Yes, you do. We're in these places to die. Just let me get on with it. My mouth isa little dry. Just... give mea little water. Thank you. Esther, you haveto eat something. Now tell me,what's happened? My lawyer wants meto testify. Oh, good! Good. The jurywill believe you. We'll see. Yeah, mm-hmm. Always a pessimist. Realist,I like to think. Pessimist, pessimist,pessimist. I saw my father. Was that hard? It wasn't easy. But I didn't hate him. Not like I thought I would. He wanted me todrink with him. That... was the hardest part. And watching him cry. Oh, he cried? He didn't know my motherhad died. I almost feltsorry for him. She was his wife. Pathetic old drunk. He just...started to pour another. It's stronger than he is. Maybe that's whyhe left-- to protect you and your mother. Protect us? From himself. From his weakness. Maybe he saw the damagehe was doing and knew he couldn'tstop it and so he left. To protect you. Yes. Not him. You said he cried. For himself. Maybe for all of you. Ah, you'll see. Things will work out, Michael. For you and Faye. I havegreatfaith. Hello? Oh, is that you, Faye Murrow? This is Esther Huish. Who? Esther Huish. Um, yeah, I-I remember you. We talked on a bench at Whitewood. Michael's in trouble. He needs to know that the peoplehe cares about believe in him. I do. Then why haven't you called him? You can't believe the problemsbetween you are all his fault. You love him. You have to talk to him. Work things out. He really needs you, you know? Dr. Heath when the defendant brought youMr. McCord on October 24 did you prescribeany new medications for Mr. McCord? Yes, I did-- one for his coughand one to relieve pain. Was the painkiller Oxycodone? No. He had been on Oxycodonepreviously and I wanted to try something else. Now you testifiedearlier that you found bruiseson Mr. McCord's back and hip. Did you treat those bruises? No, they seemed to be healingon their own. Were they recent bruises? No. Based on their colorand tenderness my estimate is they were a week to ten days oldwhen I saw him. Your Honor, I would likethe record to note that the defendant startedworking at the Whitewood on October 21-- three days before he tookMr. McCord to the doctor. Clearly, something--or someone else-- was responsiblefor those bruises. Dr. Heath. So, uh... how many patients do you see in a month?Approximately? Hundreds. Hundreds? So, you seriously expect usto believe that three months after the fact you can remember the specificcolor of one patient's bruises? No. I don't remember. But the defense counselcalled me about the drug prescriptions... I looked up my notes.I keep very detailed notes about each of my patients. I have them here if you'd like me to read from them. That won't be necessary. Raise your righthand, please. Put your left handon the Bible. Do you swearthat the testimony you're about togive to this court will be the truth,the whole truth andnothing but the truth so help you God? I do. Take the stand,please. Mr. Keddington,did you steal or use anyprescription drugs while you were workingat the Whitewood? Michael? I-I'm sorry? Did you steal or useany prescription drugs while you were workingat the Whitewood? No, I did not. Did you hit,or hurt Henry McCord at any time? No, I did not. Did you kill Mr. McCord? No,I did not. Thank you. Isn't it true that whenAlice Richards left you alonewith Mr. McCord he was alive?Yes. And then when he was next seen,he was dead? I don't know. I mean, someonecould easily have gone in his roomafter I left.Someone? Butyouare theonewho was actually in his room. And you were the onewith stolen drugsin your locker. Objection,Your Honor. Andyouwerethe one who threatened a coworkerObjection. when she exposed you! Objection! Sustained. Counsel, stop badgeringthe witness. All rise. This court is adjourned until 9:00 a.m.tomorrow morning. Amanda? Could you step outsidefor a moment? I've got somethingto show you. Sure. Hi. Hi. I don't believe it. Somebody set me straight. At today's lunch break,I went to the Whitewood. I got these records. I want you to takea look at them. When I testified,I didn't realize that Dr. Heath had changedHenry's prescription. Aliceneglectedto tell me that. I suspect she didn'twant me to know. But why would she hide that? Henry's prescription forOxycodone wasn't canceled. It was simply replaced by the new drug. You mean, Alice could'verefilled the old prescription? Yes. Usually theyprovide for refills. She could've done it anywhere. We use several differentpharmaceutical dispensaries. Can you get me a listof those? And what aboutthe other drugs? She could've been doing thiswith other prescriptions? It's hard to believe. It's very dangerousto use these drugs. Alice knows that. Maybe she's addicted. Or maybe she's selling them. So, I have been just tryingto figure things out. And all I cancome up with is is that I love youas much as ever and no matter what happens with the trial,I just want us to be together. What if I goto prison, Faye? For a long time? I won't allow youto tie yourself down. I know what I'm doing,Michael. You don't have to protect me. Why do you say that? "Protect me." Because that's whatyou're doing. You're protecting mefrom yourself. And then Faye walkedinto the courtroom and, well,that was incredible. Wonderful. Wonderful. I'm so happy for you. You said she'd come back,and she's here with me now. Oh, I told you so. Hmm. And what about you? Are you, uh,feeling any better? Oh, much better. Michael, you there? Yeah. Michael, I want to tell youthat I love you. I love you, too, Esther. Good night. Your Honor, thisis dated November 15 and conclusively provesthat Alice Richards refilled a prescriptionfor Oxycodone long after it had been changed to a different medicationby Mr. McCord's doctor. Even so, Your Honor,this has no bearing on the charges againstthe defendant. Your Honor,I would now like Alice Richardsto be recalled. Miss Richards,do the lockers at Whitewoodactually have locks? No, they're morelike cubbyholes. So, it would be easy, say for someone to have placed drugsin Michael's locker? I suppose. Now, aside fromHelen Staples you are the only other oneat Whitewood authorized to orderprescriptions, correct? It's one of my responsibilities,yes. Does the nameEthel Morrison mean anything to you? No. No?Uh-huh. How about Lea Marsh? No? Anna Crockett, Lucille Hammond Jacob Romney,Harvey Stromberg? I don't know. They could have allbeen patients. Yes, that's right,Miss Richards. They were all patients at the Whitewoodduring the last two years. Do you know what else they hadin common? They were old? They, too,had prescriptions for either Oxycodone--the drug that was foundin Michael's locker-- or for Alprazolam. Now, since then some of these peoplehave either died or gone home yet you continued to refilltheir prescriptions. Why? I didn't. Yes, Alice, you did, actually I have the proof from the dispensary. I want a lawyer. You were also stealing drugsfrom Mr. McCord. So, what happened,Alice? Did he threaten to expose you? I said I want a lawyer. I mean, you were just tryingto keep him quiet, right? I mean, you didn't meanto kill him. I'm not saying anything elseuntil I get a lawyer. Mrs. Ibarra. Mr. Palmer, would you pleaseapproach the bench? Mr. Palmer it sounds to melike you have the wrong person on trial here. I don't need a judgeto tell me you're innocent. I told you so. Michael, I havea special favor to ask. Yeah, of course.What is it? What do you need? Michael,take this locket... back to the boardinghousein Betheltown. You put iton the mantel where it was first given to me. That is whereI discovered my love. That is where I let him go. That is wheremy heart belongs. Now, this is for you. This is the ringThomas gave me. He wouldn'ttake it back. What you do with itis for you to decide. Faye? You'll see. Helen... We lost her this morning. I'm sorry. We shouldhave been here. No. She didn't want usto see her die. You sure about this? No. It's going tobe a long haul. We'll do it together. Dad... I'd like youto meet Faye. It's nice to meet you. Hi, Faye. It's nice to meet you. The woman I'm goingto marry. Good for you, Mikey.
