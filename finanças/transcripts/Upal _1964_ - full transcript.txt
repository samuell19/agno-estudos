HEAT SCREENPLAY STARRING MUSIC DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY DIRECTOR -Did you ring? -No, I have nothing to ring with. -Maybe it was the alarm clock. -It's not wound up. So, wind it up. -Did you wind it up? -No, it's the door. I wonder who it is. It's so early. -Well, I wonder too. -I may even ask. -Who is it? -The Prime Minister. The Prime Minister, what should we do? Ask, what Prime Minister. What Prime Minister, if I may ask? Local Prime Minister... yours. -Local. -Ours. -What shall we do? -Open the door. -Good Morning. -Good Morning. Thank you. By the way, it was by the door. Thank you for your kindness, Sir. -Please, take a seat, Sir. -No, thanks. I'll walk around. Extremely hot today, isn't it? -The oldest highlanders don't remember such heat. -Exactly. Why "the oldest highlanders"? With the age, memory weakens, Sir. Highlanders' memory. -Some milk, Sir? -No, thank you. - Oof, how I'm boiling, - Huff, how you're toiling. I'm fully exhausted and all out of breath, Yet the coalman continues to stoke her to death. What coalman? You're right Sir, it's just that heat. Maybe I'll have some milk. Here you are, Sir. Oops, you've spilled some. Thank you. I stopped by, because I want to ask you a favor. It's so hot, and we're overworked so we've decided, I and my colleagues, to go out of town. For a short time. -Good idea, Sir. -We thought it might be good for you, but we didn't dare to call with an advice. That's so nice. Citizens rarely think about the government in this way. But coming back to the subject, there's no one in town, so I wanted to ask, serious people as yourselves to look during our absence at the... Ah, that heat... ...at the whole thing, take care of the town and of a few people. To sum it up... You're very welcome to go out of town, Sir. Sure, we'll have an eye on... And we'll take them under our care. But, why us, if I may ask? You live in the downtown and all in all... So, anyhow, thank you kindly. Oh, that heat. Sir, please pass on our greetings to everybody, especially -the minister of education. -Thank you very much Sirs. And I count on you. You write beautiful songs. Chestnuts, chestnuts... 'Chestnuts', it's not our song. -The Prime Minister is not obliged to know all our songs. -Right. Why did you ask to greet the minister of education? The most handsome minister, not to mention that she's a woman. It's open, Sir. Official uniforms. To be returned. What now? Now, we can only put them on. Let me see how you look in it. Well, it doesn't fit properly. It wrinkles under the armpits. -These are official uniforms. -You're right. -Maybe rented from the film studio. -Quite possible. -How do you feel overall? -Quite good. I see that the town is deserted, and we can handle it. Attention! If we stop the frame in this way, don't grumble, it's for your own good! The Board. Somebody is littering the town. -We must intervene immediately. -Right. Quickly, the garbage can. -Where? -Here. Is that Ms. Grzanka? Yes, this is Miss Heat herself. She has a big influence on men. Exactly, it's funny, that she doesn't influence us. In our age it's not easy when it comes to heat. Two old men, grey hair, poor health but in their hearts still May. We're in a hurry to join you for a breakfast, Barbra. But already looking around for a supper. Barbra, you can't imagine who woke us up this morning. Barbra doesn't care who woke us up this morning. So, you two gentlemen, didn't leave for the summer? No, we didn't. Why? You see, Barbra... Firstly, we like the summer in the city. We just love it. Secondly, we have the task to complete in town. We have to look after the town for some time. -Please, Barbra, don't... -Wait... Barbra, please, two shakes for us. Listen... To be discreet. Oh, look. Eh, come on. Barbra, medium shaken, if you may. Wait, wait. This way. Look, he'll fall. Everyday he falls like that. Why? Because he's in love. I wonder with whom? That's Cornel from Romeo and Juliet. Cornel from Romeo and Juliet? I don't recall Cornel in Romeo and Juliet. Wait a minute, Gindenstern, Rosenkrantz, Morgenstern... "Romeo and Juliet", it's a fashion house. The fashion house, "Romeo and Juliet", is open. -We should pay them a visit. -Write that down, because later we'll get it mixed up. Please write. Number 1. Visit the fashion house "Romeo and Juliet". I'm sorry. Anyhow, it's not right that there's a hole in the road. Why nobody has taken care of it yet? Write it down. Number 2. Make sure the hole is repaired. Why nobody has taken care of it, yet? What do you mean nobody? Albin has been repairing it for a long time. That's him. Song for the working ones: Without work there wouldn't be a pay, what would compatriot be without work, compatriots, if he repairs roads or studies diligently years later with his work he will enrich the country, we don't want to force you with that truth, but we want to ask you to rethink that, we don't want to force you with that truth, but we want to ask you to rethink that. Maybe you need some instruments? We are to look after the town for some time. We've been asked by... Well, it doesn't matter by whom... If it comes to the instruments... I would like to have a guitar. -And not just any guitar, but super... -Super Orpheo. That's right. I have no ear for music, and I can't tune it up, and the super Or... Super Orpheo. O...Orpheo has automatic tune up. You can't buy it in here, but to import it, is too expensive. Maybe you can try: La... La... Easy, easy. La... La... Yes, he needs the one with automatic tune up. It's... Hot. Yes. I can't measure the size of this hole, but all the material must be accounted for, it's all because of the heat. If you give me the data, I'll do it in the shade. -Oh, that's so nice. -You are welcome. So, I'll go for a breakfast. Listen, what else did we have in our plan? The visit at the fashion house. Zenek! The flying bullet tore off his arms, but he was still by the cannon loading it. Where? Where is my platoon? Where? Hey! Where is my platoon? It seems like it's gone. Soldier's word that it was. Since they implemented these damned rubber boots, you can't hear army on the asphalt. Where could I look for them now, in this damned heat? Maybe in the shade. In the shade. There is something wrong with our engine, -when it stops, it starts playing. -Can't you stop it? Can I? Turn it off! We're voluntary sunstroke prevention team, within the summer action we came to the capital to help, but I see no one here. No people with sunstroke. And how do you, gentlemen, feel? I'm fine, thank you. How about you? I have to admit that not too well. Maybe I can give you a shot? -I'd rather like a massage. -Common. You'll have a massage and I'll fill in for the prime minister? Please don't pay attention, to what my friend is saying, because he doesn't say the same in the sun as in the shade. So you're filling in for the prime minister? I... we fill in... but it's not important for whom. Anyway, we could use your help. -So, please, inspect my team. -With great pleasure. See, governing has its nice side. Traveller Slavek. Currently the supplies officer. Dearest ones, I would like to prolong my business trip. We are busy right now. Besides, we are looking after the town at the request of... it's not important, whose request. That's okay, I'll wait. Business trip is over at 8 pm. I already took care of the... it's three letters p...p... Whatever... Okay, I'm going to take care of some personal matters. I report my departure. Are you done with the inspection? -Casually... -Casually, yes. Forewoman Susana calls the end of the inspection. Twelve on the team, casualties - none. What's next? Maybe ladies can stay at my service? Our service. Yes, our service. Yes, Sir. Gentlemen! -Please, buy a paper. -Some interesting news? None, but you could sway a little bit. He fell asleep. He fell asleep. He fell asleep. We're sorry to wake you up. That's okay, I have a light sleep. -Are you alone in such a big place? -Yes, how can I help you? We just stopped by, because we're asked to look after the town, -during the absence of the... -Whose absence? It's not important, whose. Anyhow - somebody important. May we help you with anything? Maybe someone could replace me for a while in the warehouse. For how long? Not too long, just the time it takes to propose. How far do you go to propose? Not in this heat. -You're in love with someone. -Yes. I love her so much, that I could lose my mind. That's not good. Mind can be very helpful in such situations. Hush. I just made up my mind a moment ago, while sleeping. It's not good that you take such a decision in this heat. That's true. During the night I suffer from insomnia, during the day I fall asleep instantly. If I fell asleep during the proposal... If the situation is interesting, you won't fall asleep. Oh, I'm sorry, ladies. How can I help you? We're together. But can we cope with the clients? Exactly. It's not busy. Heat. Heat and the prices. Please, write it down, lower the prices. Yes, what did I want? You wanted to propose. To propose? Propose. Yes, that's right, see you later. One word about the installments sale, Client must have a guarantee of the two adults, or four minors, but in the latter case they must have a note from their parents, if the parents are alive, or from their chaperones, if they are dead, but when one parent is alive and lives with the chaperone, which means chaperone lives with the parent... no... Do not sell anything at installments. Attention! This language can't be translated into Polish. I would play the guitar for you Super O... Orpheo... Orpheo, but I don't have it. I can only kiss you. Mademoiselle, can I get a tricorne? With cheese? No, for the head. I see. The diplomatic one. I'm sorry, I only have catering. Diplomatic one you can get from this man, at the "Romeo and Juliet" fashion house. Cornel, you have the client. I'm sorry that I can't attend you personally, but I'm here with some important business., Someone is filling for me, if only you could go this way. Thank you. I'll be back very soon wearing a new tricorne. What important business brings you here? Barbra. I love you. You are... You are my dream. It's taking him long. If he is proposing nicely... Yes. Write it down, that we'll have to take care of him in case he gets turned down. - We can't leave him like that. - That's right. -Blacks start appearing. -It must be at least 50?C. Good Day. Good Day. I need to have a men's conversation with you. This way, please. Thank you. Gentlemen. I'm the ambassador of some superpower. These are my accreditation letters... It's okay, your Excellency, we trust your word. Well nothing unusual, I testify such and such... May I have tricorne size 58 and half ?. Do you know, where the tricornes are? Maybe this one, your Excellency. Your Excellency has the face made up for the tricornes. I've lost my old tricorne at the train station. Can you imagine... that no one was there to welcome me. Not even a little girl with flowers. I'll issue a note. You don't believe me. This is the copy. Please, read it. It's a scandal. Can you pay for the tricorne? Ah, yes. What are you doing at five o'clock this afternoon? - Nothing important. - Not at all. Would you like to come for the cocktail party at the embassy? With great pleasure. -These are the invitations. -Thank you. Now, we should go with the note to the department. Listen, this is extremely severe note. He's breaking off the diplomatic relations. Indeed. Do you think this is a legitimate copy of the original? This is done through carbon paper, here is the stamp. The Prime Minister had forgotten that this ambassador was coming. -We can't allow this to happen. -Indeed. What would the Prime Minister think about us? Listen. Go to the department. Maybe you can catch up with his Excellency and stop him somehow. What about you? I... I'll lower the prices. Song for the consumers: Don't rush with the shopping; maybe you can get a discount, maybe the article you desire will be gone from the market and you'll keep the money, we don't want to force those rules on you, but before buying something, rethink that, we don't want to force those rules on you, but before you buy something, rethink that. Don't you want to get better acquainted with me and my people? -I'm in a rush. -It won't be long. Really? Susana, Zosia, Nusia, Basia, Pusia, Kasia, Wisia, Asia, Wiesia, Basia, Lesia, Lusia, Misia, Piesia. Resume. I was born to a father welder and mother from small intelligentsia. My father was drinking and beating my mom, but mom was so small that he missed. -Early in my childhood... -Interesting, but I'm in a rush. I'd like to avail this opportunity and tour the city. -I'm running to the department. -Why are you running? -Because I'm in a hurry. -How about going in our ambulance? -Much better. -Let's go back then. Notes. Does my new tricorne suit me? I haven't seen your Excellency in the old one. It's hard to say. I love you. I love you. I've just issued a note... an extremely severe note, and I'm leaving. -Go with me. -Where to? I don't want to reveal the name of the country, that was offended through its civil servant. I'm just asking out of the pure curiosity, because I don't want to leave the country of my ancestors. I can only say, that my country is great exporter of water. Our water is of excellent quality, drawn... But with excess of water we have deficit in air. -Really? -Yes. So, together we could establish profitable transactions: water and air. Besides we export famous brand guitars, Super Orpheo, water resistant. Super Orpheo. Albin. My name is Dudi. Super Orpheo guitars? You are so much interested in these instruments. You can see one, if you'll be so kind to come to the cocktail party at my embassy. Today, five o'clock in the afternoon. Can you pay for the milk? Oh, yes. This is the coin. Don't you have smaller change? I'm sorry, but I don't. If your Excellency eats a serving of buckwheat, we'll be even. Excuse me, what nationality? Do not blow at me. He offended me. You are a witness. Do I blow at this nationality? Please ignore this man. He will leave soon. But I can't allow you to blow into my buckwheat. You won't? Let me. I lowered the prices. Considerably. I lowered the prices considerably. Can they be interested in anything else apart from my body? For example that I'm a patriot like legendary Wanda who didn't want... and would rather drown herself... -I also have a soul. -Yes. -What's up? -It's very hot. -I'm asking about our matters. -I was late, unfortunately. Madame, let me introduce my friend. And this is my friend. We have a bad political situation. -The clothes here are awful. -Yes, that's right. Can you spare us some of your time? I don't know if you know, but Ms Grzanka is a patriot, ready to sacrifice for the country, including drowning. Like the legendary Wanda, that didn't want. Yes, especially in a heat like that. I see all the time, her not wanting, and then drowning herself. Exactly. Well... You don't know each other. If you have time today at five, please, come to my embassy for a cocktail party. Now I can extend my business trip. We can't talk to you right now. I understand I'm not in a hurry. I took care of the... letters, well it's not important. Now, only personal matters. Bye. Thank you so much for filling for me, but it was for nothing. The most tragic thing happened to me: I fell asleep during the proposal. Don't fall asleep now, because something can happen to you. -Was there a client? -Yes. -Ring it? -What for. For Cornel. I'm here. There was one ambassador, who bought the tricorne. I know him. He's a sex maniac. Let me introduce, this is Cornel. And this is sunstroke prevention team in the Kupala's name. -Feminine. -Very feminine. -Tired down... -Quiet. -Tired down, poor babies. -Yes, tired down. Let's talk in the bathroom. I'll fix the Pusia's pillow. Don't sing. Watch out for the legs. -Do you think it's appropriate? -Your legs. Okay. -Piesia sleeps standing. -Why? -They sleep beautifully. -Quiet. Song for the mature men: When she snoozes and sweat snooze swings her, and the girl breathes through her beautiful rosy lips, we have to warn the men, not to wake her up we don't want to force you with that advice, but we ask mature men to rethink that. we don't want to force you with that advice, but we ask mature men to rethink that. What do you think? Is it possible for us to convince him to withdraw the note? Is it possible for us to convince him to withdraw the note? If we won't, the outcome might be terrible. Do you think that it might lead to, God forbid, conflict? Of course. -Imagine, overseas country, -Yes. -Not too rich, -Yeah. They can't afford to send their army here... Maybe we could rent an island half way... Exactly. -At least they'd have to pay for the half of the island. -Yeah. -Why should we pay for the whole island ... -Hush. Exactly. Sending the army half way, paying the rent for the island, well, half of the island. How long would it take for a battle like that? Well, maybe three days or so. If you're already there, you want to stay longer. It's not worth it for them. -Well, unless they won. -But it's not worth it for us. -So we can't allow for this to happen. -Definitely. -Will Ms Grzanka keep her word? -Of course, -she is an excellent patriot. -Excellent. But I'm not sure if it can be done without drowning. -It's terrible. -Yeah, awful. -Is that you whining? -No. Was it you? No. We have a hot weather as for the local relations,don't we? The oldest highlanders don't remember such a heat wave. -There are no mountains in my country. -Really? Then, who wouldn't remember such heat in your Excellency's country? Depressionists. The oldest depressionists, we have wonderful depressions. -What are your favorite flowers? -Flowers of feelings. Heat is tremendous as for the local relations, isn't it? Any relations, in such a heat are impossible your Excellency. What are your favorite flowers? A piece of boiled beef with flower. Messieur Cornel. What are your favorite flowers? My favorite are roses, cornflowers, daisies, tuberoses, dahlias, lilac, snapdragons... Messieur A, Messieur B. What should we talk about with his Excellency? About weather, flowers. Heat is tremendous as for the local relations, isn't it? What are your favorite flowers, your Excellency? Ladies and gentlemen, I allowed myself to invite you for my modest party, so you could in person check my country's hospitality, which I represent. You have nothing to accuse me of. Of course not, your Excellency. In a minute... we'll go to the adjacent room, where sandwiches with black caviar, oysters, lobsters, and other similar evidences of hospitality are waiting for you. All this on the table and my open heart, were waiting for you at my doorsteps. But what was waiting for me at the train station, while I was traveling to this town to take the post? Not even a soul. Not even a little girl with flowers, not even one born out of the wedlock, all alone with my secretary in a big foreign city. So it shouldn't be a surprise for you, ladies and gentlemen, that I've decided to react to such a reprehensible act with a note. A sharp and severe note. So I've issued it and placed it where it belongs. To familiarize you with its content... To familiarize you with its content and not to bore you, please, let me sing it for you. Song for the diplomats: Diplomats rich with hard currency, living in palaces, furry with coats even though plain people on foot don't know the oysters life of a simple men is richer, we don't want to force that idea on you, but in the privacy of your embassies rethink that, we don't want to force that idea on you, but in the privacy of your embassies rethink that. Your Excellency, taking the form into consideration, it was the most beautiful note known to diplomacy. I think everybody agrees to that. Thank you. -Howbeit... -Excuse me? -Nevertheless... -Nevertheless. Please. Nevertheless, your Excellency... Nevertheless, reacting so strictly to the insult, you didn't consider the fact, that had influence on the whole thing, which was the heat, your Excellency. We have right to state that, as we've been asked, it's not important by whom, to look after the city for a while. So we ask your Excellency to withdraw the note, - which you'll regret anyhow, - When it gets colder. When it gets colder. Please, your Excellency, withdraw it. -Your Excellency, don't be like that! -Don't be like that! -I never withdraw anything. -Really? Yes. In this case we are sorry, but we won't eat the sandwiches. And together with us, all the patriots. We won't touch the oysters either. What about cognacs? We won't touch them? That's too bad. Everything will go to waste. Your Excellency, not only cold buffet will go to waste, but the life of a hot patriot. The one who speaks to you now, will drown herself, if you won't withdraw the note. Where will you do it? I haven't seen any lakes and river dried out. We know how to drown ourselves. Bravo. Bravo. Your Excellency, simple flood victim, Slime Ignacio, in desperation that it's the third year with no flood... Fourth year. ...that it's fourth year with no flood - drowned himself taking soda water into his mouth and covering his nose with fingers. This is alcohol, you'll choke. Let me show you my winter garden. This is my winter garden. Excuse me. Grzanka. I would like to extend my business trip. It's over at 8 pm. Now it's not a good time. You see the situation we're in. I understand. Bravo, bravo. I'm not surprised. 'Cause you have a beautiful house. Such a crib. No, you didn't have to. There're lancer at the window... Traveller Slavek, currently supplies officer, I would like to extend my business trip. It's over at 8 o'clock. I'm traveller Slavek, currently supplies officer. It's beautiful here in your winter garden your, Excellency. But it's sad. This resembles the state of my soul, which you are hurting, My body and soul are for somebody else. Call me Dudi. My body and soul are for somebody else, Dudi. For whom? For Albin. Albin. The asphalt man, yuck. Yes, Dudi. This man lost his interest in you when he saw a guitar. I'm not surprised; he sees me everyday, but the Super Orpheo he saw for the first time. You're very tolerant, Barbra. Dudi. -Call me your Excellency. -Really? Yes. Your Excellency. I've saved some money, so if your Excellency wouldn't want too much... -Do you want to buy the guitar? -Yeah. Only hard currency. -I'm sorry, but I don't have it. -Really? Yes. Oh yes, you have it. Albin. Let's go. What is ambassador up to? -What is ambassador up to? -Up to indecent proposals. Grzanka! There is no use to drown yourself now. Until we settle everything concerning the note. It might turn out that your actual weight is lower than water's and you'll suffer. Mr. Curly, is there any salt? Grzanka! May I talk to you, it's very important. Please, madamee, excuse us. It won't be long. Hello. This is the management of the city water board, while waiting for the water, we'll broadcast, through the pipelines of our lathered consumers concert titled: Water in Music, Georg Friedrih Haendel. Wasser Music. Demonstration? Demonstration? Just look. Grzanka, Grzanka! Will you eliminate them? We'll try. Do it for me, please. Now I have to take some tranquilizers. -I wonder what with that note? -Exactly? Didn't you spill it out somehow? No way. Not even in your sleep. I don't sleep when on duty. -Shall we go to the demonstrators? -I guess we have to. -Our term is hard. -Quite hard. -But we'll manage somehow. -With our experience. Compatriots. Compatriots, I don't know, if you know... I don't know, if you know, compatriots...-I don't know if you know...-We were asked ... Do not interrupt me. I'm loosing the thread. It's not that bad. Ambassador promised to withdraw the note, if you leave in peace. I mean if you were so kind to just take a walk, he would withdraw it. Maybe you can try now. He promised to withdraw, and he seems trustworthy, his Excellency. Grzanka, Grzanka. They didn't react. It's hot, they have to rethink that. Ask for a louder ringing to wake them up, if they're still asleep. Whom should I ask? You're right, don't ask. Hello? Hello? Hello, Zosia? Krysia? Jasia? -Ask who's speaking. -What? -Who's speaking? -Ah, yes. Who's speaking? Susana. Susana. Susana, please wake up the whole team... -We're surrounded. -What? We're surrounded by demonstrators at the embassy... Where? -By the Caper Place. -By the Paper Class. Hello. By the Caper Place. See you. Yes, Sir. Alarm! Fall in! Your Excellency. We've undertaken some steps and we may take the situation under control. Grzanka, Grzanka! What a nice control over the situation. We'll undertake some more steps, your Excellency. Yes, your Excellency. Hold it, hands up! We're taking you hostage. If they break the gate, I'll shoot you. Why are you so angry? Why did you take away the guitar? Because we were leaving! Why did we have to leave? Ambassador was wooing me! Just when I was about to tune it up! You're playing when some ambassador is woooo... Makes advances to me? What now?! I'll be alone the whole evening? Alone?! I'm here with you! But I don't have the guitar! The guitar is more important than me? Yes! I have you everyday, but the guitar... I'll never hav it. Oh yes! You will have the guitar! Who? The Prime Minister asked us to look after the town. The Prime Minister asked you and you weren't at the train station. We were not. You were not, and why? We didn't know. You didn't know. The Prime Minister asked you and you didn't know. Because firstly we didn't know and then he asked. Who? The Prime Minister. -When? -After. Before. Before. Who are you, anyway? Two old men, -grey hair, -poor health but in our hearts still May. Hands up! How do you get the money for a living? -From the author's fee. -What do you do? -Now, we are scared. -You are scared? What do you do, when you're not scared? We write songs. For the people. -My friend is a composer. -And my friend is a poet. Poet and composer. Prove it. Yes, play it. That's enough. Off-key. Sing. I look at you and all I can see is you, I look at you and no, I'm not ashamed, to look at you like at the sunset... Enough! Hands up! No way, not in the dirty water. They are gone. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the effective intervention. Many thanks for the effective intervention. -It helped. -Now your Excellency can withdraw the note. Yes, of course. Wait for me in the room. We'll go together to the department. -Excuse me, where is Excellency. -In his quarters. I came for the guitar. I look at you and all I can see is you, I look at you and no, I'm not ashamed, to look at you... Yes... Super Orpheo! My dearest... my dearest, now, I really have to extend my business trip. But we are not in power to do that. -Do you have the pen, at least? -There you go. No, I won't blow, once I blew and I was in trouble. Maybe one of you could try? Thank you. Extended. Traveller Slavek, currently supplies officer, reports his departure, with extended business trip. Mr. Traveler, the exit is this way. Ah, merci. Bye. Bye. I wrote everything on it. Gentlemen ... Gentlemen, let's go. Bye. Extended. I haven't thought about that. He is awakened. We'll distract him, while your Excellency withdraws the note. -What if the door is locked? -We haven't thought about that. Gentlemen, I have the idea how to get in. -Do you see the opened window? -Yes. One of you distracts the guard, while the other gives me a leg up. -Will you give the leg up? -To whom? -His Excellency. -So, I'll distract. -Whom? -The guard. It's hot today, isn't it? It's very hot today. I don't hold discussions on duty. -I'm just stating the fact. -I don't hold discussions! -None of the topics? -No. Too bad, you know, there is no one to talk to. I have something in my eye! In the right eye, not the left one. I'm not moving. I'm standing still. Grzanka! Grzanka! Are you taking a plunge? No, I'll drown myself. What about the bike? The bike is a two-wheeled vehicle. But you won't drown with the bike? No. May I go for a ride? Go away! Go away or drive away? I said, go away! What are you doing!? I'm drowning. Don't do it, you'll kill yourself! What should I do? Wait for the surge. Okay. Damn it. Are you drowning as well? Yes. Why? For the country. I do it for private reasons. There is surge coming. It starts to rain. One moment, I have it. Unbelievable. That was in my eye. Who is that man? This is my friend. Why is he standing by this open window? Probably he is asking them to close it. It's useless, there is no one in. Let's show him, what I had in my eye. You see, what I had in my eye. Whose are those shoes? I take them when it's raining. When it's... When it's raining I wear one pair, and the other one is to change. The other pair to change them? To change them. Ouch! Here. Ouch. Hello, hello. This is the guard, hello. Mr. Dry? It's raining here too, so Mr. Dry is not here. Bye. Song for everybody: Is he getting wet in the rain, or is he roasting in the sun, the guard spends his time alone on duty, to give him a rest let's not be ashamed relief him at least for one day we don't want to impose that duty on you, but please, by the way, rethink that, we don't want to impose that duty on you, but please, by the way, rethink that. Gentlemen, Cornel decided to drown himself under the Rapture Bridge. It's Cornel's bike. Too late. Ouch! Careful the water level is rising. Careful the water level is rising! His Excellency withdrew the note! Gentlemen. In appreciation to what you've done for both our countries, to prevent the outburst of the conflict, I would like to present you with an award of the full rising moon with one, or maybe two, or let say three, satellites. Girls. Song for the bent ones: There are no lyrics. we don't want to force you with that truth, but we want to ask you to rethink that, we don't want to force you with that truth, but we want to ask you to rethink that. Goodbye. It was an extremely expensive gift. That guitar. Oh, God! Barbra. My head clean forgot about my wife, whom I love more than life... and my three sons, the scouts. They very much like me. Yes, it's true. Spitting image of their daddy. Good Night, Barbra. How do you say that? If I caused you any trouble, I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you very much for everything, especially for the guitar. This is to remember me by. Thank you. Girls! We're leaving. -Piesia. -Pusia. -Piesia. -Pusia. -This was Piesia. -No, it was Pusia. Bye. Goodbye! It's so nice after that rain, warm and so fresh. None of that heat left. Thank God, that the note has been withdrawn. Yes, now we can take care of the rest. Please, look what else we have on the list. I just realized that his Excellency has the original Super Orpheo. And now we could get it for Barbra, -so she could give it to Albin... -Look! -So, how was it, gentlemen? -Everything is fine, Sir. Thank you, Thank you kindly. Would you like a lift? No, thank you, we'll walk. Thank you. THE END. Re-sync by Virgil
