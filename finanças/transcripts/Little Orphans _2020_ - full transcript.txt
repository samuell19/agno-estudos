The apple doesn't fall very far- Maureen's not going to ask you to stay. I can't. You know, I don't see either of your parents in you. You remind me of Maureen, if anything. Look, it's hard to keep things together- without ticking people off. That's my take on it, anyway. Come summer, we're going to have more scapes- than we'll know what to do with. Did I ever tell you about my friend Diana? Yeah. Smoked. All her life. Diagnosed with lung cancer. Age 35. Died 8 weeks later. 3 kids. The oldest still in middle school. What a sin. Figured I might see Tom this morning. It was nice to see Tom when you were around. He's like- He's more- like he's got his sea legs. Shall we mosey then? I can get a cab. No. I'll take you.
