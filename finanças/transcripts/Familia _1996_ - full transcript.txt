Coming! Shit! August 6th, 1975. 7 weeks in Rome and 5 in Florence. Hotel Romo, Vía Lorenzo. Lorenzo what? -What do I know! Givertti, Lorenzo Givertti. Which do I wear? -I don't know. The broken ones. Isn't it too much? He might get angry. Which is mine? -That. Fuck, I like this one better. Do you know who owns the doors of the palace of the Medicis? -Well, the Medicis, no? Whose are they, who made them? -What do I know! Hey, there wasn't another wrapping paper? -No, give it to me. -You are going to break it. -Are you going to tell me which ones should I wear? The broken ones, damn it. -They're very snug on me. Then why do you ask? In the end you will wear whatever the hell you want. -Man, you are not going to decide! Wear what you want. -I don't tell you what to wear. But that is what I say! Do you hear this? -No. (Final warning) How are you? Better. What time is it? Very late! Come on guys, let's go! -Has he gotten up yet? Not yet, but he ought to be getting up just now. How are you doing? -I have two left. Come on, I'll help you. Heat some milk. And close the door so that we aren't spotted with the gifts. What's up? -These pants? You don't have others? -You see? What do I do, change? -There's no time. Take out the cups. How are you with wrapping packages? -You're an expert with "packages." -Douchebag. -Don't fight. Is it already 10? -A minute till. -Can we sing happy birthday? Later, when we give him the gifts. -Not now? -Not until 10:15. You already forgot? Cups are missing. -Ready now. Pick up everything. I would give them later, when he doesn't expect it. Then why do we give them to him on his birthday? Nico, you didn't hear me or what? Get off the TV. I'm going to. -No, not "I'm going to," turn it off! (The alarm clock ringing.) Is he coming? He's here, he's here. Do you want more? No. Are there coconut cookies? You've got a vice. Carlos, pass me the butter. What a novelty, you all together. Be careful, it is very hot. Didn't you go out yesterday? I stayed studying. And you? They don't give you coconut cookies? Why don't you give him coconut cookies? Because they make him fat. But if he's already fat, what difference does it make? You always disagree with me. I am not fat. Of course not. Take out the cookies. Let him take them, he is not paralyzed. I'm not fat. -Of course not. Don't pay them any attention. What time did you arrive? I didn't hear you come in. I don't know, early. At 3, 3:30. Did Rafa bring you? -Who is Rafa? Classmate. -Her boyfriend. That's nothing! -You have a boyfriend? -No, he's a friend. And why does he bring you home? -Because he has a car. Bring him so that we can get to know him. -But there is nothing to know! Why not? Usually when you get a boyfriend, they come meet your parents, right? You should have seen Dad... .…the first day he came looking for me with gifts for grandparents and everything. -As it should be. He was so nervous that he gave the box of cigars to my mother and the bonbons to my grandfather. And since then Grandma smokes cigars. -No one wants more? I slept abysmally. Not sure what happened yesterday, but I was up late. Must be your conscience. Why conscience? -I don't know, just like that. It's a saying, right? Since when? -You've never heard it? You've never heard that? When someone can't sleep, they say that. But let it be. -Rafa says it? It's just a saying. It's not a big deal. What's going on? -Nothing. Why? - Are you sure? -Something strange is happening here. - What's happening? I don't know, but something. -What was that for? -Nothing, it's an expression. -You don't think they're acting a little weird? - No. They're like they always are. See if this clears it up for you. -This? -Happy birthday! I was saying that something was up. Happy birthday son. Thanks Mom. How old are you? Very. Almost as old as Grandma. No. I beat all of you. A round of applause for the designer,... ..the credit is yours. Right at this time, at 10:15,... ..Uncle Santiago was running to the factory to warn your father. Oh, the years that have passed. He came out kicking and screaming like a crazy person. Well, he hasn't changed much in that regard. -Luna. What? It's a joke. What you put me through… -I know, Mom, you tell that story every year. It took more than two hours for him to leave. -Dad has always said that arriving late is his style. Your father was even more nervous than me and Uncle Santiago coming and going, ..and dad, would call him to to tell him he was scared to be alone. That's why you named him Santiago, right? -It was when Grandpa yelled at him ... that we named him after him. Fortunately, she did not call the maid, her name was Margarita. Sorry for the delay. Happy birthday. Thanks, Martín. Martín was there. Do you remember Uncle Santiago running to the factory? -Again, mom? Perfectly. And about his father, how nervous he was. You should have seen how he was! -When the doctor hit him, ... ..he said no, he was in charge. He didn't want the first ... ..person to make your son cry be a stranger. Fucking hell with grandpa! -Well, what about the gifts? Are they just going to lie here? Your brother called, he will be here mid-morning with his partner. This is from Luna. Open it, it's a surprise. But hey, what is it? -A hint? For you to do sports. It wouldn't hurt you. And these sleeves? -They are reflective, so they can see you from afar. I prefer not to be seen. -Maybe they can be taken off. -Use only the bottom. A stopwatch! Do you like it? Very much. But why do I need a stopwatch? Well, I don't know. To time things, no? -Of course! To know how long something lasts. What happened? Nothing. And this? Who is it from? Me. What is this for now? -Santiago. You've already screwed up everything. A pipe! Are you an idiot or what? What's wrong, can't you hear me? -Sorry. How well everything was going and you come out with this. Where did this idiot come from? Why don't you know I don't smoke? Santiago, please. -You all knew it! So then? Santiago, you're making him cry. -Dad, I love you. What? -I love you! Well, I don't believe it. Where are the tears? Please, I love you. -Anyway, I did not want a fat son. I said it, huh? Nor one with glasses. Did I say it or didn't I say it? -He's the best we could find. -Dad? - Don't call me Dad now! You're dismissed. Go to your house to learn to cry. And I want another child without glasses... which I don't think would be so difficult . And one who is not fat. I don't want to spend my birthday without my little boy. Sorry. He's crazy, don't screw with me! He's a sick person, it scares me. -He will hear you. -He has fired one of us already. You don't know how to cry? -We should have been more cautious. This really can't turn out well. -Well, we all agree, right? We had nothing else. -Before this, nothing. Of course, you live with your parents. -Carlos, please, this is very strange. -Actually, it's like a play. -Yes, but for only one guy. -We have already acted... ..for only one person in the past. Remember. You have been very good before... ..with that Rafa thing. -Really? -It was perfect for you. -And what do I do now? -Let's wait for Ventura. He should be coming soon. We met 22 years ago, we were married 20 years ago, he was at the wedding, that was in Santander. And who else was there? Mother. Dad had already died. Okay. When did he die? Two years earlier, from a heart attack. And now? To the right, then go straight ahead. Don't leave it there, that gets dirty. -It is the ashtray. -Even so. It breaks down. Santiago, when was he born? April 1940, 8 years before you. -What more? Favorite color, blue. He loves television, documentaries about animals, coffee, ... ..salads. His type of woman is tall with brown hair. -So? Like Carmen. In that we have been right. They're taking a long time. Sole has not had time ... ..to prepare for the role. They were going to look at it before leaving. They will have been delayed. -What a surprise. For birthdays people hire clowns, no? Or whores, what do I know. Why don't we hire a whore? Because maybe he wants something else. -Like what? Well, like a family. -To me he seems more endearing. Maybe he had a car accident... ..and the whole family was killed and that's why he does this, or maybe a plane crash many years ago. And since then he puts up all this on his birthday, like an homage, what do I know. You've been watching too many movies. Why not? It could be, right? Or he murdered them and they're buried in the garden. -Don't bullshit! I have seen sand removed in the rear side. -Don't say that, please! What is he doing? Cleaning the pool, right? He seems to be looking for something. -Maybe he has them there. - Impossible, the dead float. Those who have stone tied around their neck don't. -Carlos, dude... -You know he's teasing you. Where were you? Over there. Don't wander much, the less he sees you, the better. -They're talking about us, I'm sure. - You're right. He said "Luna." Come on! -I swear. You don't know how to read lips? You see? Again. They are talking about you. -Don't pay him any attention. "Leave that one to me, she's hot." -Let's see what Ventura says about Nico. -He will say that this way we earn more money. We will have to find a substitute. Maybe his authentic family ... ... will come back on Monday. - Maybe they'll return earlier from their trip and find us here. Here you don't see a photo or anything. -Maybe this isn't his house, he could be renting it. He really doesn't have anyone? -If he had them, they've left, because to put up with this… -Probably he isn't that bad. - Sure, tell that to Nico. And Nico? He doesn't look anything like me. He's brown-haired. And you have the same eyes. I have dark eyes. He does too. That's just the light. And he's not that fat, either. -I have started to diet. I haven't eaten anything since earlier. Let's see... I don't understand anything. Well? I like it. Do you love me? I love you so much, Dad. Did you put champagne in the fridge? 6 bottles. Will it reach (the right temperature)? Sure. We're going to be 7, right? Why don't you cut your hair? I don't know, I'm used to it. Your neck would show more. Here. I like it better like this. And you, Luna? Long suits you better. (The horn of a car.) They're here now. And this car? Hi Aunt. Hi dear. I thought you would never come. We haven't been here in a long time. What about Mom? Resting. Martín has gone to inform her. It's new, isn't it? He's like a fool with the car. How is everything? Everything has happened, I'll tell you later. And you? Good, nothing special. You haven't been delayed a lot? Your sister is quite burdensome. How do you see life at 55? Well, very similar. One year further. You realize? It has been like this all day. He's a kid. Yes, they gave me a tracksuit. The gift is in the car. I'll go get it. I'll go with you. He's crazy, he's kicked Nico out. -But he is here. Miraculously, because he has kicked him out. Have you seen how he put him? But then he hugged him. Hugged whom? -Nico. Did he hug him or throw him out? Both, but first he kicked him out. Then nothing happened, right, everything continues like before? The glasses had to be removed. How do you see without them? Not bad... You see? He sees fine. He's a little weird, no? Why? I don't think he's strange. Ventura, for God's sake. Would you pay to someone to play your family? -Ventura would pay to get rid of them. Maybe so. At least I would look for someone who liked their job. And what is that for? So I don't get complainers. I like my job. Well, if you like it, you wouldn't complain so much. Or not? Ventura. He has kissed me. Who, Santiago? Twice. And he's touched my ass. So? You don't care, right? It seems perfect,... ..that is, that you are doing well. But you are my husband, I'd suppose it would bother you. Carmen, for God's sake, you are an actress, actors kiss, I've seen you kiss many people. But why do you go to that? I've also seen you kiss actresses. Well, then, it's the same. But he is not an actor. He's doing it for real. That is what we do not know. You just have to pretend a little. And if he asks me to sleep with him, I'll have to, right? As an actress? Tell him your head hurts. You tell me. And the contract? Martín wanted to see you. You see? They are serious, they pay. Everything will be fine. The man only wants a happy family. Happy family? Isn't that what the Chinese eat? It should be in the glove compartment. How is everything? Very well. Here it is. Is my brother is nice to you? Does he make you happy? Yes, very happy. -I'm glad. You make a really good couple. I remember a lot about your wedding day. It was in Orense, wasn't it? In Santander. That was at least ... 20 years ago or so. It is true. Dad was gone. He died two years before a heart attack. I think about you all a lot, you know. Do you remember the day I introduced you to my brother? I don't know. Sometimes I think we should have told him. We were just kids, 17 or 18 years old, right? -Yes, of course. The withholding? Down, at #5. How's that going? Fine, I'm here with the squid. Like Captain Nemo. Get off. What if he catches us? The contract is here. I was making copies for everyone. You like this, don't you? It will be very useful for the car. -Look, don't tell me about the car. Again? We are going to be paying it for 10 years. It is a very good car. But why do you want a family car if you don't even have a family? For rehearsals. The problem is that we have no family. Neither family nor money. We cannot afford to have children. But a family car, yes. But a car is different, it's an investment. Having the van? With that van I can't ... ..go to visit customers. What, are they going to get scared? It doesn't start. So your sister can keep it, she uses it more than us. Look, Moet Chandon. -It is for later. You see, not everything is a misfortune. Can I pour myself a drink in your shoe? You will see, I wear sandals. Like when we were hippies. Don't cry please. I'm not crying, it's the onion. It is very nice, thank you very much. Is it okay? Sure. And if not, we can always use it to hit children. Of course. I'm going to take out the tablecloths. Watch over the stew. Your wife is a charm. Yours too,... ..I just fucked her in the car. May l? Pass. I'm going to wash my hands. All yours. He liked it very much. -I'm glad. I mean the belt. -Me too. A horse's head. Can't you see the ears and the teeth? What teeth? The teeth. Don't you know how to play clouds? How do you play? Well, looking at them... ..and saying how they are shaped. And who wins? Nobody, nobody wins. Nor does anyone lose. What is that shaped like? Cloud. -That doesn't count. -Why? Because all clouds have a cloud shape. -Then I was right. All: Happy birthday, happy birthday, ... ..we wish you a happy birthday. Come on, blow! -You have to make a wish before. But quickly, we are hungry. Done? -Yes. Well, say it out loud and blow. You have to blow them all out for it to come true. Well then ... ..I hope we always stay together. That was creepy. "Make a wish," who came up that that? How could I have known? -Come on, hurry up! - Did you hear what he said? It's only a game. And what if it comes true? How will it come true? Bring these out, they'll get warm. I once made a wish for an exam and it came true. Come on! On stage! Is it raspberry? It is delicious. -Nico, the plate. A little bit, eh. Let's see if it sounds ...! Carmen. Let's see, Luna. I don't want any. She's like you. You two are some of the few people I know who do not like champagne. Me? -You don't know what you're missing, ... ..When we were kids, your uncle always toasted with soda. -You don't know what you're missing. Shall I give you some Fanta? You aren't going to toast with an empty glass. Fanta is very good. Well, cheers! Cheers! Do you remember the trip we made to Rome? What was it, in the 70s? In '75, and then in Florence, in the Hotel Romo. -What a memory! You were a child. In Florence, right. And the year before in Amsterdam. -Beautiful. Do you remember? Yes, the canals, the people on bicycles ... There we had our honeymoon. It was like a second honeymoon. Wait a minute, wasn't it in Paris? Paris, beautiful too. In Paris? Sure, sure, it was in Paris. You're right, it was in Paris. The Amsterdam thing was another year. It was the same year. What happened is that we got down at Paris The highway is beautiful. We got off by train. Good heavens, we don't get any right! And who remembers the Christmases we spent in Berlin? East Berlin or West Berlin? (The phone.) I'm going. -Was I born? Yes? Just a moment. Father! Yes? Hi. Who? -A man. So Amsterdam! -He said so! And you followed him. It was here in the papers? If he talks about something you don't know, ... ..you pretend you don't remember! And you? "The highway is beautiful"... Sorry, I was not on your 2nd honeymoon. You think how you want. I think as I want, that's why I'm the director of the company. It already came out. Don't argue. -It doesn't have anything here. What are you doing? -Searching for Amsterdam. Keep that which is next to it. And you, you don't need to look at him with that face. -Me? -Yes. Carmen, it is Benítez, who wants to greet you. Damn, who is Benítez? No idea. You take it! Carmen! Coming! See you soon. Benítez? Yes, we were at his house in Mallorca last summer. -Ah, of course, Benítez. Benítez? What are you going to do tonight? Go out? I don't know, no idea. Why? -We could have a barbecue. Give your wife a kiss for me and your children too. Goodbye. It was Benítez, he sends memories to all of you. Honey, Benítez has no children. You have to see what head you have! You always forget. I got you! What a bastard! Thank goodness it has been left over. Fill it with water. As if he'll notice. You could help, no? -It looks like silver. It must be worth a lot. -Leave that there. If you take it, he won't even find out. -What nonsense, you think he's silly? With this I could pay a couple of months rent, minimum. You want to kill us all? -Are you stupid or what? And why the thing that we continue together? It's a saying. And then watch what happens. -If in addition to wanting to have ... ..a family and then he wants to kill it, he kills us all. Carlos! -Don't you read the newspapers? The other day there was a guy, I'm not kidding... ..who he had killed his wife and children ... ..because he was tired of queuing for the bathroom. And ..apparently he was an educated guy, imagine. This is another thing, we have signed a contract. Besides, there are plenty of bathrooms here. He's coming. It is nice outside, we will be able to barbecue. And I'm going to take a nap. Will you come with me, darling? Won't you get in bed? Are you going to go to bed dressed? Yes. I don't know, I'm cold. Let's see if you have a fever. No, leave it, now it's passed. I'm not sleepy. What's going on? -I don't know, it's that lying down makes me dizzy. You're sweating. Do you want me to bring the thermometer for you? No, it's just the stomach. Wait. For what? -It embarrasses me. Shame? At this stage? Santiago, my head hurts. -I have a great remedy for that. (Someone is crying.) What envy! Show me how you do it, please. There are many tricks, from not blinking to irritating your eyes. But that's the easy way. The best way is to have reasons. Nico, this interests you. -What if you don't have them? You look for them, thinking of something sad. -Although it has nothing to do (with the situation)? It doesn't have to. What makes you feel a lot of sorry? -Me? I don't know, war… Something that made you cry a lot. A fight with your parents, your boyfriend. Something like that. -Bambi. It's true. When they kill the mother, it's horrible. -Do you know what makes me feel sorrow? When I see elderly people who walk very slowly and cannot even climb the curb. -I got it. I feel great sorrow when they kill ... seals in Antarctica. You don't see the news? The seals are hit on the head as to not damage the skin. But how are you going to think about that in the middle of a scene. -Why not? If she feels like crying. I don't know, in Antarctica? I would feel cold. What's up? What's up? As if I'm your neighbor. I don't know. What do you want me to say? -What anyone would say! I just slept with someone else, the least you could do ... is get pissed off. But I get pissed off! You don't have any curiosity. You don't care if we fucked one or ten times? How is it that "I don't care"? -Well then say something! I don't know, ask, shout a little, so it seems like you care! He'll hear you! Carmen, please, I beg you, we are working. Not now! -Not now, what? Well, this, arguing! I swear, we'll talk and fix everything tomorrow. Tomorrow will be too late. Hold on a bit. Do you think that the apartment and the car pay for themselves? The car matters fuck-all to me. Do you want me to tell you... ..how much I care about the car? Carmen, what are you doing!? It seems to me that a girl out there got a flat tire. Carlos... You'll see. What's going on? A girl with a flat tire. She is very pretty. And what do we do now? Because he will want to continue with the comedy. Speak well of your father, get into the character. If they were here, you wouldn't talk like that. Are they coming? She'll realize that we are not a family as soon as she enters. And why is she going to notice? We are actors, no? I'm not at all late. Make the calls you want. My family. Hi. Hi. Alicia. Her tire's been punctured. There you have the phone. I just don't have a spare wheel. It's the second time this has happened to me. And on top of that, I was on my way to the station, and I was already late. Do you have the time? Ten till. I won't arrive in time anymore. Communicate. -Shall we take you somewhere? No thanks, I don't want to leave the car. Would you like a coffee? Either way. We were going to have one anyway. Can you help me, Luna? Luis, I have a punctured tire. Well, tomorrow because it will be the last and ... Luis, listen to me, I have punctured and I haven't... It wasn't my fault. I didn't put it in any way, it is you who is making it like this. Call me at home tonight. No. No! Sorry. She will realize everything. We should tell her that this ... ..is the house of terror and that she should go if she wants. Don't complicate things. That pig was delighted and so was Ventura. Get me a tonic, come on. This poor thing doesn't know what she is getting into. Weren't you complaining that we only had one spectator? Now we have two. Not bad, there may even be a division of opinions. And the opener that was here? No idea! He's just like you. Oh yes! The three siblings look very similar. There is a bit of cake, do you want some? We've had a celebration. It's my husband's birthday. Oh yeah? Congratulations. Later we're going to have a barbecue in the garden, why don't you stay? -No, many thanks. Come on, you just missed the train. -I can't, they'll call me... and if I'm not at home, then… We will not finish late. Leave her, you see that she doesn't want to. -It's a family party. Anyway, I don't belong here. On the contrary. We have plenty of time to see each other the rest of the year. Of course. She's believed it, we are damn good actors. How would she realize what she's gotten herself into? -Better like this. But from now on ..there can be no failures. -Fucking great. The more difficult, the better. -Have you seen this cool thing? - By the way, leave the opener... where it was. -What opener? -The silver one. I have not touched it. -Carlos, I'm not playing around. I haven't touched it. Brother's word. -I'm not your sister. Help me. We have to tell her. -Who, Alicia? She won't understand anything. We can't fool her like that. Have you seen how he looks at her? - The pig likes her. - Me too. Catch me properly, I'll kill myself. Shit, he's coming. Don't leave me alone, I'll be scared shitless. - Calm down. Hello Dad. How's the grill? -We are cleaning it. Go find Alicia so she doesn't go crazy. -I'll go if you want. No, you go, Carlos. -I don't care. I prefer Carlos to go. I won't be long. Shall I help you? I got it. What's going on, Luna? Nothing. You're good? Very good. Then why do you evade me? -I don't. I have the impression ... ..that you're scared of me. -What are you saying? You and I don't talk much, right? -I don't know. About what? About your affairs. I know you are at a difficult age. Don't worry, I'm fine. Really. -But there are certain things... ..that a father should be able to speak to his daughter about. Sometimes it seems like a lie ... ..that living together, we know so little about each other. For example, about Rafa, I didn't even know he existed, and you're dating, no? Well, friends, dating, more or less. -But do you sleep with him? I don't know, sometimes. Will you use contraceptives? Are you ashamed that I ask? -Well, a bit, to be frank. On top of me caring about your affiars, if parents talked like this with their children, there would not be so many troubles. Condoms, we use condoms. -And you put them on? Or he does, alone? -He does, alone. Were you a virgin before you started with him? -Dad, please. -What's the matter? You fucking ask me everything? -It seems natural to me, we're father-daughter, no? Is there no trust between us? -Yes, but… So were you a virgin or not? -No, I was not a virgin. Do you suck it? -Fuck. -Do you suck it or not? -Well, yes, I suck it. -And the previous ones too? Yes, all of them. I suck everyone. -What's the matter, I can't find out who my daughter sucks? No, you can't! What's up? -Fucking hell! I'll be right there. Something the matter? Nothing. Luna's a little weird. What happened? -Let go! Let me go, damn it! What's going on? -I'm leaving! -I'll talk to her. -Sure? -Yes, sure. Calm down. -Calm, nothing. This guy doesn't screw with my life anymore. What the hell does he care if my boyfriend sticks it in me! -He asked you that? What's going on, it makes him horny? -I don't know, could be. It's not worth it for me. If Ventura likes him, great, but I'll have nightmares for 3 months. There isn't much time left. -I don't care. Hang on for a bit. There's almost nothing left. This guy is dangerous, really. Look at the room, do you think it's normal? This is nothing, come see mine. To be in your home, you are here. Your father is also a tyrant. Yes, but at least he's my father. Worse still. If it were my father... ..I wouldn't be here now. He didn't want me to do theater. Mine didn't either. The first time I signed up for a course, ... ..I had to say it was English. I was going to my class ... ..of interpretation with a dictionary in my hand for two years. And they didn't find out? -Nonsense. They think I speak English like a motherfucker. You see? Two years in disguise, and now so much drama over one day. -Is not the same. Of course not. Here they pay you. And then there are the incentives, When have you had... ..a brother like me? -I'm an only child. What are you doing? -Changing my clothes. Here? -Of course, we are siblings, no? There is trust. -Lots of trust. What there isn't is clothing. Sorry about the phone. Luis is llike that. A little impulsive. Don't worry. -He had been saying for a long time that I would go see him. On Monday he goes to London and of course... If I had gotten a taxi ... ..I would have arrived on time. Right. I don't know, I wasn't too convinced either He is married to another. Does it bother you that I tell you? No no, please continue. The trip to London is with her, on vacation. That's why it was so urgent ... ..that we meet. We have been like this for two years, him saying that he'll separate... ..with his wife and me believing him. Just like the tire puncture... ..it was a sign of destiny. -These things happen. -Sure,... ..because then I come in and meet a family like this, so normal, ... ..like I would like to have, because I am very familial. I don't know, I'm very envious. Sometimes I think I can never have a family. Don't say that. I too ..thought the same, and now, you see. -No, really. You don't know how good you look. I'm sure you'll have your troubles, like everyone, ...maybe I'm wrong, but you seem very happy. Is this how it looks from the outside? I see your brother so nice ... ..to his wife and your mother and the very nice children you have. Nico is a sun and Carlos and Luna get along very well. (Gasps.) ¡Carlos! Damn, it's Dad. -Carlos! It's Dad! -What fucking Dad? Can I enter? Get off! -He isn't your father, we can do what we want. -Hide! Dad! What was I missing! (Knocking on the door.) Go to the bathroom. -This bathroom? You have to screw yourself! -Carlos! Coming! What were you doing? Nothing. How are your studies? Good, very good. Do you have an exam soon? Two, next week. Have you seen Luna? No, not in a while. I don't know, she was acting a little strange earlier. Not sure if something happened to her. Yeah? I find her just fine, as always. I've tried talking to her, ... ..I think it did not go very well. Maybe it's my fault. Did she tell you something? No, nothing. I love her very much, seriously, I dare not tell her, I am ashamed. Sometimes she looks at me in a way like he doesn't know me at all. I really love her very much. I don't know, whatever. Sorry. Don't worry. I guess I'll know how to tell her. These things can be learned, no? Do me a favor if you see her ... Best to not tell her anything. -Okay. Have you heard? That he loves me a lot, no? He has balls! He does. I think he was serious. How's it going? Ever since she came, he doesn't pay any attention to us. And my role is not very far either. Is that too little for you to do with my wife? Very little, from what my sister says. And what do you say? He's teasing you. -So you say now. There is nothing to tell. -Oh my god! And you have nothing to tell me? -Of what? Of you, of your relationship. -I don't know, how you get it on in bed. You make a good couple. -What was that for? Calm down, I mean the catch. -As a marriage it is credible. Look, Ventura is affectionate, he caresses you, he seems to be the perfect husband. I'm working, no? I'm a professional. -Oh, so you have to be paid? -It helps. And how much do you cost? Because maybe it'll pay off for me. -Come on, Carmen. Let her act. -She screwed up my car. It's just envy, I think you do it very well. -Fine, you have it. Envy. Can we drop it? You will have practiced a lot to do it so well. -Carmen, please. And when? Because I have not seen you. In your house? In a hotel? Or where? You are crazy. -Like today, no? You'd been practicing all morning, and thus you arrived late. I already told you why I arrived late. -No, you haven't told me: you told me your sister is burdensome, ... ..but that can mean many things. Since your sister is heavy, she she took time to lower her panties, ... ..and so you got late. This doesn't happen overnight. You must have been practicing for a long time, ... ..a couple of years at least, right? Since we got married? No, if it doesn't matter, you guys are incredible, you make an awesome couple. Maybe you've even thought about having a child together so the fucking family car with the balls would be worth something? I'm going to see if they have something to give you. Sorry, sorry. Your cup? -He doesn't drink. No, he doesn't like champagne. No, not much. But, come on, I'll try it, so I can't say I haven't. Today is an special day! -Very well said. I don't know if I will like it. How is it? Hey, it's not bad. -Of course not. It's good! Can't believe I've been missing it for all these years. You see? It's impossible that someone does not like the Moet Chandon. Moet Chandon. What is that, a brand? -Of course! How are you? -Very well, enjoying a day celebration with my family, what more can I ask for? And that dress, where did you get it? -From the closet. How pretty! I shouldn't say it, but I'm glad you punctured your tire... ..and that you missed your train. I think I'm glad you didn't get along... .. well with your boyfriend. H must be calling home ... ..every five minutes. Maybe you were right when you said the thing about the signal. How did you call it? Destiny? Do you want? -Thank you, Nico. -You're welcome. I'm going to talk to my wife. -About what? -About you, about us, I like you. I have to tell Carmen. -What? I want us to tell her together. -But what are you saying? Carmen, please come! -Coming. Don't do this to me. -Calm down, nothing's going to happen, surely you'll understand. But understand what if there is nothing to understand? -That we love each other. I have to go to the toilet. Alicia! What did you want? -Nothing. From me, nothing. What do you think? -About Alicia? -I don't know. Sweet, no? I like her very much. Actually, I like her more than Mom. Does it seem bad to you? No. Bad, no, Weird. Does Mom know? -Not yet, and I don't know how she is going to take it. Well. Very well, I'm sure. Have you seen anything for ice? Give it here. It's better with hot water. There is not much left. Don't worry about me, I'm getting used to it. To what? To Santiago. He doesn't strike me as so bad anymore. And it hasn't been bad to try. I don't understand. Try what? -Well, this. Another husband, another family... You become boyfriend-girlfriend at age 20 and without realizing it, you are .. ..with the same partner at 50, you don't have time to compare. It's not that you and I don't get along, it 's that maybe ... ..there is another with whom you understand each other better. -Right. For that reason I say that it's not so bad to try, like one tries a car. There are various options, you choose the one you like the most. And to choose, you have to compare. And how is the comparison going? Very well. And are you starting to like him? Very much. Since when? I dont know. Between the 3rd and 4th time (we had sex), I think it was. This gives you other perspectives, no? But before you will have to go back to compare to make sure. No, no, I have already compared enough for today. Did you know that 80% of couples without children separate? What is this, a threat? -A statistic. He can enter at any time and if he catches us, then what? Carmen, you are my wife, I have every right in the world. What am I doing here...? (Hits.) Sorry. I'm sorry. Alicia. Have you seen Carmen? -No. Is there any champagne left? It's running out. Carlos, go to the kitchen and put a bottle in the fridge. No no! Don't go, it's all the same. I'll have wine, it doesn't matter. Do you have a lighter? In my bag. Can you pass it to me? What do you want, the lighter? -I'll take it. Doesn't matter. You don't know where it is. Do you want to give it to me? Give it, please. Take. It looked like lipstick. -It looked like. What? -How are you? Why? Are you okay? Yes, it's not that, it's that… I don't even know how to start. Start what? I like Alicia. When she arrived she just seemed pretty to me and now ... ..I don't know what's going to happen. You're not going to say anything? I don't know. It surprises you, no? -Of course. And it doesn't bother you? It does bother me. -Well then say it, damn! It bothers me that you go after the first ass that appears! I didn't say that, I just said I like her. And what do you want, ..for me to go fight with her? Or to give you my blessing? Please, Carmen. Or to tell you, "go, fuck her"? Can't we speak normally, without yelling? No, we can't, just like we can't invite a girl for coffee without you wanting to fuck her. Look, about earlier, the kitchen... It's fine, you don't have to explain anything to me. It's not a bad thing. In some way, Carmen and I are married. More or less. It's as if we were, but not today. I don't know if you get my drift. Santiago knows this and does not care. Santiago knows you sleep with Carmen? Yes, but no, from above. He doesn't know about today, but in general, yes. I think. It's incredible, you don't match at all. It's not what you are thinking now either. A biker with a helmet, do you see it? Could be. What I don't see is the bike. He doesn't have it. Are you a biker without a motorcycle? -Of course. Look, that one looks like Ventura. -It's true. What about me? There's a cloud that looks like you. My god! Poor thing, he must be very lonely. He is not so alone. Look, Alicia's there, we even left him paired up. I would be calmer. If it gives you so much sorrow, we can stay a few more days,... until Monday. I don't have anything to do. I have an exam tomorrow. -You can't postpone it? -Aren't you going too far? They're coming. Shall we take a photo together? We don't have a camera. -I have one in the car. A family photo. Raise this. Sole, get closer to Ventura. Get down, Luna, with your brother. Here? Perfect. Santiago, hold your wife. -You don't go out? -Can't you turn on the automatic setting? It's not automatic, it's quite bad. But it's fine, really. Let Martín do it. -I'll go find him. No need, it's a family photo, I don't belong here. -Yes, relax. Get in front, Rosa. -It doesn't matter. What is there to see? -Pay attention, mom. And that? I couldn't find Martín. You won't look great but you'll show up, which is what counts. You see yourself? Yes. Get in front, mom. -I'm fine here. -You can't be seen. -Pay attention to him. Is the mirror okay? -Get in front, mom. It's all the same. -No. No it isn't. If it was, you wouldn't have said it. Can I be in the mirror? -Shut up. Mother? -I don't care what you say, don't ask me to move. Leave her to what she wants. -You shut up! If you want to be in the fucking photo, go where we tell you, and if not, leave. Don't talk to your mother like that. How should I tell you things... beating you like Dad did? -Don't you ever raise your voice at me again. Sorry. Smile, Nico. You too, Luna, smile. Come on, Sole. Alicia, please, smile. We're all going to smile. Smile! You're very close, Nico. Get a little further form the screen. -I'm going. We will have to take him to the eye doctor. Nico? -Yeah… He loves watching TV, he even knows the ads. And Mom? Outside, looking for the bracelet. What, Grandpa's? It got lost? In this light, she will not find it. And besides, it's cold. Leave her, you know how she is. She won't go without it. -Go where? To bed. -And why doesn't she look for it tomorrow with more light? She's like that. I'll go see. You won't have nightmares later? I wouldn't be able to. When I was a child, they'd have to leave me with a lamp on all night. Later there was always fights because we spent double on electricity. They say that fear of the dark is fear of loneliness. That when you don't see anything, it's as if you were alone. I am unable to sleep with an open closet in the room. Children are very afraid of them, I think it is because the form... ..reminds them of coffins. They notice that and are very sensitive to it. Not anymore. Now they are afraid of zombies ..and those things. Nico, are you afraid of a closet? If it falls on you, yes. Rosa... Rosa! At least you could have called. What do you want? I'm sorry. How old was she? -80. You can't do anything? -Not anymore. Come with me, I will accompany you. How is everything? Normal, as always. Do you have something? Nothing, four flights in July and then we get something for the summer. But nothing for sure, you know, the usual. Not bad. -And you all? Nothing. Four flights in July. Maybe we get something for the summer, the same as always. See if you call me next time. Luna, please. Come on, let's go outside. -Leave me alone. Come on, shall we go out? I'm sorry. Fuck, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. It's not your fault. I'm sorry to have come like this. To have come like what? You'll have to forgive me. You will not understand anything. I didn't want to deceive you, but I don't know, I have been paid to come here ... ..and do all of this. And well... well, I've done it. Damn, you’ve got to be kidding! You must be hallucinating, I would be too. I'm really sorry. -It's incredible. Very much. Don't worry, she's not dead. -I'm cold. -What's happening here? -She's not real either, like us. But what are you, an actress? -You aren't his family? He's crazy, fuck me. And the tire puncture? A lie. -He's paying her too. -What time is it? Nothing's wrong, lie down. My back hurts. Good heavens! And I was convinced that I was tricking you all. I was even remorseful. And that crying? -I don't know, the seals, I had a terrible time. You see? -What seals? Hey, your death was fucking perfect. I played Cleopatra for two-and-a-half years. -And I was thinking: this woman... ..is dead and here I am featuring. Sure, I know you from the Don Juan tests. And I think I've seen you at The Comedy with Manu. -Sure. -The very tall and thin one. Who is Manu? (Someone applauds.) Thank you very much, you have been stupendous. Truly. I really liked it. All this time I have enjoyed... ..my own family and I have been very happy. It is much better to be in poor company than alone and those who say otherwise ... ..is that they have never been alone. You have done an excellent job. There have been a couple of great moments ... ..and if there could be reviews, they would have been very good, for sure. I love you all very much. Perfect. You have the keys? Yes, they are here. Come on, Nico, come say goodbye to Santiago. Give me a kiss. Thank you very much. To you. Wrap yourself up. Pay attention to him. Alicia! You've been great. Let's see if we can talk, ... ... sometimes we have substitutions in the company ... ..and maybe we could work together. Sure, next time knowingly. I'll leave you my card. The first number is my home number. Make us a copy of the photo, okay? Very well. I'm going to leave the camera in the car. And why does she give you her home phone number, do you know? Both numbers are on the same card! What is she going to do? Cut it? And what's the need to tell you? "The first one is my home phone." I do not know what to tell you. Well. - Delighted to have been your children. I am very proud of you. -The pity is having being able ... ... to rehearse earlier, it would have been better. -Alicia! We will see each other for Comedy, no?. -If you stay with Manu, tell him to call me and we'll grab something. He's out now but returns Saturday. -Well, on Sunday, then. -Great. -And now I have lots of free time. It has been a pleasure to fall in love with you. I say the same. I was very moved that you wanted to leave your wife for me. There was a moment that I thought you were serious. Well, we'll see each other and all that. Maybe one day we will get back together ... what was it? Destiny. That. Destiny. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Come on, okay, no extras. See you around. On Monday they'll come to get the car. Yes. I have left Martín's card. Anything you need,... ..Christmas, Father's Day, whatever ... call us. I've got it. Well, ready. Are we all here? I really wanted to get out of here. Come on, it wasn't that bad. Three like these per year and we have the season resolved. -Don't count on me. (The car won't start.) What's going on? (The car won't start.) I was born on April 20, 1940 after 10 months of pregnancy. My father used to say he didn't want me to come out because he already knew... ..what was waiting for me. I started walking in a year. At six months...
