You! You again! Get out! Go on, I told you. Get out! Go on! Papa! You stupid dog! You'll settle with me! Let's go! Welcome to you, stranger. My name is Juan de Dios. lam the bell-ringer. Why are you here? To see the Rojos? Ne, not the Reyes'? The Baxter's'? Maybe not even them. You want to get rich? This is the place. If you use your head. That's because everybody here has become rich. Or dead. What do you want to buy? Guns? Liquor? You don't buy, you sell. Lead for gold? You'll get rich here... or be killed. Juan de Dios tolls the bell again. Saludos, amigo. It's not smart to go wandering so far from home. - He picked the wrong trail. - Or the wrong town. His big mistake was being born. You want work, looking like that, try being a scarecrow. Oh no, the crows are liable to scare him. - Hello. - Saludos. You can't get rich like that. At best you'll get killed. All our trouble, and now you! - What are you looking for? - Food, drink. - Water is over there. - No water. Eating and drinking. Killing. That's all your kind do. - All you can think of. - By the way. - You'll have to mark this up. - I know, you have no money. You just got into town. If you don't mind doing some killing, you'll find someone eager to pay you. My roulette wheel. That too was murdered. No one ever comes to play. We pass time between funerals and burials. Never saw a deader town. - You'll see none like it. - What's wrong with it? Too many killings. See the women? They're not women, but widows. Only widows. You only get respect by killing men. So nobody works anymore. It seems somebody doesn't share your opinion. Saludos. Know why Piripero looked you over? To take your measurements. He can do it with a glance. You'll be a customer. It's no joke. Those murderers will make a corpse of you. That's why I want you to leave. You don't want to stay in this cemetery. Finish up and get out! Told you I can't pay. Be my guest. But get out of San Miguel. - Where does that lead? - The balcony. Why are you going there? To have a look. Things look different from higher up. But nothing's up there. Go ahead and get out. - Who are they? - Bandits. Bandits and smugglers. They come from Texas to stock up on guns and liquor. They cost less here. They sell them to the Indians. Guns and liquor make a town rich. Not the town. Only buyers, sellers, bosses and the ones who clean up. Someone has to run the place. Every town has a boss. True, but when there are two around I'd say there's one too many. Two bosses. - Very interesting. - Interesting is right. The Rojo boys. Three brothers who sell liquor. And the Baxters, big gun merchants. You already met the Baxter gang, right? Yeah, we met. They don't usually limit their fire to the mule. A man leaves his land and looks around. Juan tolls the bell, Piripero sells another coffin. Two bosses. They've enlisted the scum from either side of the frontier. And they pay in dollars. Benders over there. Rojos there. - Me right in the middle. - Why are you the one? That crazy bell-ringer was right. Money to be made in this place. If you're thinking what I suspect, I tell you, don't try it. Which one is the stronger? Which one is stronger? Well... the Rojos, especially Ramon. Don Miguel Rojo, I want to talk to you. I hear you're hiring on men. I might just be available. I've got to tell you before you hire me. I don't work cheap. Get three coffins ready. Adios, amigo. Stranger, wasn't it clear? We don't like bad boys like you here. Get your mule. You let him get away from you? That's what I want to talk about. He's feeling real bad. My mule. Got riled up when you fired at his feet. - Hey, you making some kind of joke? - No. I realize you were playing around. But the mule just doesn't get it. If you apologized... It's not nice to laugh. My mule don't like people laughing. Gets the idea you're laughing at him. Now, when you apologize it might convince him you didn't mean it. You killed all four. You'll be strung up. - Who are you? - Don't fire a shot. I'm John Baxter, sheriff. If you're the sheriff you'd better get these men underground. My mistake. Four coffins. Told you I wasn't cheap. But I think it'll be worth your while. ...98, 99, 100. The rest when you're all done. When do I start? I'm not in a hurry. For the moment. With four less Baxters, now is as good a time as any. In a few clays a cavalry troop will pass through San Miguel. I don't want the military sticking its nose in our business. You seem to be well informed. In these parts a man's life often depends on a scrap of information. This couldn't have been very useful to its owner. My brother Ramon did that. He uses it for target practice. With a gun in his hand, no one stands in his way. It's one of his favorite targets when he has nothing better to shoot. I'll be kind of curious to meet this brother of yours. Ah, this is Chico. One of the most trusted of my men. He'll bring you to your room. I'd like you to feel at home. I never found home that great. Let's go. Who's that? Her name's Marisol. You just forget about her. This one will be your room. You gave him $100? We never pay that much! Why have you taken him on? To have a filthy gringo here and pay him a $100. We have never paid anybody so much. You cannot let him do what he wants. He's capable of anything and I want law and order around here. If that is all you want, there is a much cheaper way. Just snuff him out. - And who will be the one? You? - Yes, why not? A shot in his back and you'd have him out of the way in no time at all. Listen, I could do it easily right now. He won't be expecting it and I'd get back the 100. You're stupid, Esteban. Even if you are my brother. A bullet in the back, eh? And it is ended. What if your hand trembles slightly and he's only hurt? With the cavalry arriving. And that Yankee so quick on the draw. - I was thinking... - Don't think. I'll do that instead. Go and see the americano. Ask him if he needs anything. Make friends. Get one thing into your head. This will be a quiet town until Ramon returns. Is that clear? A quiet town. I'm Esteban Rojo. My brother asked me to... What are you doing? Moving. But didn't you know all our men live with us? That's all very cozy but I don't find you men that appealing. Besides, your brother said he didn't need me right now. - Sergeant. - Yes, Captain. Tell the men we'll spend the night here. They can pick up the supplies here. Double the stagecoach guard. Yes, sir. - What do you think is in that coach? - It's easy to find out. Get close and take a look inside it. If they fire, you know it's gold! Good idea. Looking for anything? - Hello. - Get out of here, Yankee. Vamos! Why aren't you sleeping? Seeing you staring like that bothers me. I keep wondering what's in that coach. Something very important to them. I asked the captain some questions and almost was arrested. Who's Marisol? You'd better get some sleep. You'll need it. Much too dangerous, even for you. All I did is ask who she was. She is a woman. And Ramon is madly in love with her. Does that make it clear to you? Everybody in this town talks about Ramon. I'm curious to meet him. If you're smart, you'll stay clear of him as long as possible. There are the soldiers. They're moving on very quietly. Strange. They're headed for the frontier. Tell me. Do you always go to bed like that? Don't worry. I didn't dirty the sheets. Oh, wait. I'm coming too. I want to see how you get yourself in trouble. All right, go ahead. It's like playing Cowboys and Indians. - Admiral. - Welcome, Lieutenant. Your gold, as promised. I hope the guns you give us are equally useful to our army. Rest assured, Captain, we'll check them together. Get your clothes on again. And hurry. Place them right. Remember, they died fighting among themselves. Julio! There, that's Ramon. This is my brother Ramon. I think I mentioned him. - Everybody talks about Ramon. - Many speak of you too. My dear brother included. Well, I hope they say nice things. - Did you have a good trip? - It was tiring. It was terribly hot during the day. And stagecoaches are an uncomfortable way to travel. I'm sure you'll be in great shape in no time. The americano can't wait for the action. - Sorry. He'll be a disappointed man. - How's that? The Baxters accepted the invitation. They'll come tonight. - Them here? You're out of your head. - I told him to invite them here. Ramon, what is this? I found out many things while traveling and decided it's very stupid to keep shooting at each other without any results. - You've gone out of your mind. - No, I've come to my senses, Esteban. Believe me. Trust. Life can be so precious. It's foolish to risk losing it every minute, no? There's plenty of space for everybody in this town. Even Baxters. For this reason I have decided to hang my gun up on the wall. Ramon has the right idea. I, too, am tired of this killing. It must stop. - This is all very, very touching. - You mean you don't admire peace? It's hard to like something you know nothing of. Stay here and you may profit from the experience. No, thanks. I'll be moving on. Here's your money, Don Miguel. I only used a small amount. I don't like to take money unless l feel I've earned it. Why so hasty? You should stay here. You might enjoy dining with us. The Baxters buried four men on account of me. I don't think they'd appreciate my presence. I don't like him. He's too smart for a hired gun. - An unrivaled gunman. - I know. You can count on two things with a man like that. He's fast on the trigger and intelligent. Too dangerous for you, my brothers. Now he's gone, explain that nonsense about your gun and the Baxters. Is it possible that you'll never reach conclusions on your own? The americanos and our government will find the bodies and investigate. They'll investigate, all right. We'll be quiet and bide our time. We know nothing about the massacre at Rio Bravo. I arranged for the bodies to lie as if both companies killed each other. - Do you think they'll believe it? - Yes, I think so. If they find no guilty party they'll call off the investigation. - Yes, but what about the Baxters? - The Baxters! They only want to live in peace. Let them have their way for a while. Forget them. We'll take care of them later. When the investigation finishes. That was a fine idea that you had. What was it again? Ah, yes, yes. 'lei--... The Baxters on one side. The Rojos on the other. And you'd be in the middle. The only problem is that they've joined up. Now you're without a job and can't pay me what you owe. There's only one thing for you to do. Leave immediately. Forget the debt. You leave San Miguel and never return again. Joe, I prepared the wagon as you asked me to. It's out back with two empty coffins. What are you up to? Are you changing profession? If you want to go on living, you should. In my opinion, you'll make a fine pallbearer. - Close this place and come with me. - Close up? It's done. Where are we going? I'd like to know. Or is it a secret? Down by the river. To have a look at some corpses down there. The Rojos say, "Come to dinner" and we must go. But I don't like it. Even if they've granted all the guarantees we demanded. We'll go along with it. But don't touch anything! You mustn't eat, you mustn't drink! Just keep your eyes open and your wits about you. - Are you sure nobody has seen us? - Only a ghost or two. No. Don't joke about such things. Ghosts are better left well alone. This place suits you very well. If you go on like this, you'll be here permanently. With all those bodies by the river, why are we just burying these two? - We're not burying them. - What do you mean, not burying them? Right, we're not burying them. If we are not burying them, what will we use them for? Why are we taking the trouble to do this? The dead can be very useful sometimes. They've helped me out of tough spots a few times. First, they don't talk. Second. They look alive, if I manage it. And third. It's all right to shoot them. They're dead already. Understand? It makes no sense, I'm getting out. I'm alive and want to stay alive. When I'm dead, I want to stay dead. I'd be unhappy if somebody made me remain with the living. And I don't like that you placed the bodies there. That man is the only one who died of pneumonia in this cursed town. Take it easy, now. They're going to help you pay your bills. Get up there! The only reason they would start a war with us would be to kidnap you. Rojo is gallant. I didn't think him capable of compliments. He's not. All that he says is false. - Like his proposals. - You women! If things aren't complicated, you get suspicious. Yes, because to me it just didn't seem right. It went too smoothly. I don't trust them. You'd like to prove me wrong. It's always the same thing. - Good night. - Good night. Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you. I just want you to know why they suddenly want to make peace. There was a wagon load of gold that soldiers took to the border. John, come up here quickly! Sorry. When a husband finds a man in his wife's room you're never sure how he'll react. - Give him $500. - How's that? Give the money to him. He has an interesting story. Listen. - You didn't misunderstand? - I misunderstand only when... - Ramon! - What? - The soldiers with the gold... - Two are hiding in the cemetery. The Baxters are about to capture them. Rubio, get the men! You are well informed. A man's life often depends on a scrap of information. Your brother's words. Tell me, why are you doing this for us? $500? With two soldiers as witnesses against Ramon the government can rid us of all the Rojos. And San Miguel will have just one boss. Let's go! - Coming with us? - No. When a man's got money he begins to appreciate peace. Come on! Let's leave the horses here. Who's there? Come out! What do you think? I don't know. I don't like it. Too still to be human. More like dummies. Dummies that are very interesting to the Rojos. Hide, hurry! What'll we do? Take two men, circle around the side. Keep them busy and I'll get those two. Go on! Go on! Quickly. Keep me covered. I'm going to take care of those two. Mr. Baxter, you can have them now if you like. Dead men can't talk. It seems they didn't like my joke. We'll let them go home in a little while. This bad boy will be our guest until Baxter leaves San Miguel. Put him in the cellar. Esteban! Good work. With Antonio as our prisoner the Baxters will have to give in to us. - We can make any kind of demand. - Don Miguel! Don Miguel! - What has happened? Talk, will you? - I don't know. Someone shot at me. Marisol! Marisol! Where are you, Marisol? Strange, how you always manage to be in the right place at the right time. It's nothing serious. Just a headache. She'll sleep. Keep your eyes open. She's not to move from that room. Don't mention me bringing her here. The Rojos mustn't think I'm on your side. Don't be worried. I am a woman who's rich enough to appreciate the men my money buys. I talked to the Rojos. In the morning they'll exchange Antonio for Marisol. Very soon you're going to be rich. Yeah, that's not going to break my heart. Where is she? You said I could see her. Where is she? I want to see her! - Come back. - I can't see. I want to see her! Why can't I look at her? I want to see her! Go. Go to him, Marisol. Mama! - Mama! - Jesus! Mama. - Jesus! - Mama, Mama! Julio! Marisol. Get Julio! You were warned to get out of town. I'll make you pay, once and for all. Let him be! You better get going. Ramon's waiting. And you, get that kid home where he belongs. Pig, Ramon! - What's Ramon got to do with them? - No one told you? It's an old story here. A happy family until trouble comes. Trouble's name is Ramon. He claims the husband cheated at cards. The wife must live with him as hostage. - And the husband? - There's nothing for him to do. The Rojos left him to take care of the boy and he had to accept it. That Ramon is smart. Where are you going? To the Rojos to look for a job. Having the americano with us is the best thing to have happened. If either government starts an inquiry, we'll need every man we can get. To be at war with the Baxters now is worse than sitting on dynamite. - Where should we put this? - Over there. Drink up, everybody! Very good shooting. To kill a man, shoot for his heart. The Winchester is the best weapon. That's nice but I'll stick with my.45. When a man with a.45 meets a man with a rifle the man with the pistol will be a dead man. That's an old Mexican proverb. And it's true. You believe that? Maquito, escort Marisol to the small house. Stay there until I return. - Everything is prepared. - Don't worry, I'll return tomorrow. - The wagons are ready. We can leave. - Enjoy yourselves during my absence. You heard Ramon. Let's have a good time. He weighs a ton. Of course, with all he poured into himself. Papa. Did you not tell me no one could go see Mama? That's right. Then why does that man see her when I cannot? - I want Mama! - Come away from the door. Quiet. We can't show ourselves. Remember that! Hello. - Shots at the small house! - To the horses! Come on, let's go! Look out! There. Take this money. It's enough for a while. Get across the border. Get far away from San Miguel. How may we thank you? Don't. Go before the Rojos get here. Why do you do this? I knew someone like you once who no one could help. Get moving. Get moving! Get out of here! What do you see, Chico? They're all dead. They massacred them. - They kidnapped Marisol! - It was the Baxters. Let's get back before they attack our house in town. Chico, give out the ammunition. Esteban, put your men around the house. Miguel, you boys, behind the house. Ronaldo, Alvaro, come with me. Look. The way they killed our men, there must be a lot of them. It's a warm evening. One of our wagons lost a wheel. We had to turn back here for help. One of the men tells me Baxters attacked the small house. Do you know about it? Tell me what you know. Well? Where did you hide Marisol? Rubio. You are thirsty? Want to drink? No, no. It's too soon to drink. Bring him over here! You're a stubborn idiot. Tell us where she is and it'll be over. In a week you'll be in shape and you can go where you want. That's enough for today. He'll talk. It's just a matter of time. Don't let him escape or die. Wait till he comes to. He hardly feels a thing. I have a poker hand waiting for me. I'm stuck here guarding this americano. This is more amusing than cards. We make sure he doesn't die. But also that he regrets the day he was born. The gringo is asleep, I imagine. That's all right, I'll enjoy waking him up. - What was that noise? - I do not know. I heard a yell and a crash. It's useless to hide. You're finished playing the smart boy. Go up and look in the loft. And take a look behind the barrels. Let's get out of here. Hurry! Duck! Hurry with that water! Hey you! Come on with me. Patrol the town. Block all the streets. Find him for me! - Esteban! Search the whole town! - Follow me. Get him back right now! At any cost. Look in the stables. In every corral, in the store. Look for him in the church! Go in there. Search every inch. Search everywhere! Rubio, in here! If somebody is hiding him, burn their house down and kill them. You, come here! Look for him near the Baxters' but I want him alive! Alive! Rubio! In the bar! He says he knows nothing, trying to be smart. Bring him here to me. - I swear, I'm telling the truth. - Well, you know nothing? - Nothing. I'm not cheating. - Rubio. You take care of him. Where have you hidden him? You're perfect for that filthy americano. You'll end the same way. We looked everywhere. The cellar, the attic, the roof. There's no trace. - Nobody in the back room. - I'm sure the Baxters are hiding him. The americano isn't stupid. He knows it's the best refuge. The Baxters, eh? Then better go and get him. That's for being his friend. Curse them! Hey- - Come here. - Can't see anybody. I'm here. Dios mio! What are you doing in there? Never mind. Get me out of here. - You're not dead yet. - I will be if I don't get out of here. Get the lid down. Rubio! I see some signs of life. Let's be ready when they decide to come out. Don't shoot! We surrender, don't shoot! Stop! Don't shoot. We're coming out. - We surrender, hold your fire! - Don't shoot! We surrender. Stop. I want to take a look at this. Ramon, don't shoot. We're coming out. We surrender. Listen, you've won. It's enough. I'll get out of town. - Whatever you want. - Promise? I swear it, Ramon. - You won't try a trick of any kind? - None. No, no tricks. - I gave you my word. We'll leave. - You sure? Better ask your wife's permission. - She might not be happy. - Father! Antonio! John! Murderers! They had no guns! Murderers! I hope you rot in hell! May you die spitting blood. Curse you! Murderers! Let's go. The show's over. Search among the bodies for him. The americano has to be somewhere. Silvanito? Where's Silvanito? Any news today? I must tell you some pretty bad news. - I hate to tell you but... - Where's Silvanito? He was captured this morning by Ramon's men. They grabbed him when he was on his way here. He was bringing provisions. Ramon has him. He's being tortured but he won't talk. He's stubborn. He won't say a word. Even if it means his life. They'll never be able to force him. Now, old fool. Loosen up your tongue. - No. - Rubio! Better get back to your shop. - You're liable to have some business. - That's what I wanted to hear. I brought along a surprise for you. I know you need it. It was hard to get my hands on. I got it by using my head. No one can resist two bottles of wine. Isn't that right? I thought you might need that pistol and I brought another present. It's dynamite. I stole it from the Rojos. Seems to me the moment has come to light it and send it back to them. There's lots of light. It's too early to be asleep yet. Rubio, here. Wouldn't like to ruin the rifle. I couldn't find another like it. Let's try it with this one. Gringo! Heard you wanted to see me. The americano's dead. Let the old man down. What's wrong, Ramon? Losing your touch? You afraid, Ramon? To shoot to kill, you better hit the heart. Your own words, Ramon. The heart, Ramon. Don't forget the heart. Aim for the heart or you'll never stop me. When a man with a.45 meets a man with a rifle you said the man with the pistol's a dead man. Let's see if that's true. Go ahead. Load up and shoot. Listen, Joe. Listen, Joe, I... 'ZZZ Guess your government will be glad to see that gold back. And you? Don't want to be here when they get it? The Mexican government on one side? The American government on the other? Me right smack in the middle? No. Too dangerous. - So long. - Adios.
