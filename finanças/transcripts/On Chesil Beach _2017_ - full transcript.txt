ON CHESIL BEACH - So, we're in E. - The tonic. - No, E. - All right, E. So, four bars of that, you know the sort of thing, "Woke up this morning, head felt so bad"... - Then into A. - The sub-dominant. "Woke up this morning, head felt so bad." - Same thing, different chord, see. - Tricky. Then back to E again... Then, this is the emotional punch, it reaches right up to B. The dominant. And he says something like "Gonna tell that two-timin' woman," back through A, you know, "she's driving me mad" and then this lovely little thing, the turnaround on B seventh... - Minor seventh might be better. - And that brings you back to E. - And am I ? - What ? - Driving you mad. - Well, actually, yes. The Prime Minister, Sir Harold Macmillan, has been holding talks in Washington with the United States president, Mr. John Kennedy. The principal subject of the discussion was a proposed test ban treaty... Not tonight. Thank you. Perfect. Now listen ! - Nice microtones... - A load of sick bloody cats. I'd rather have your lot. I really don't mind, if you want that Hank person. Or is it Elvis ? Chuck Berry. It's all right, he's gone, he's had it. Honestly, you can, I think it's... He's quite... - Quite what ? - Well, sort of merry. Chuck Berry ? What else ? And, you know, bouncy. I think you must be the squarest person in all of western civilization. - But you love me. - Therefore, I love you. You know, Florence, it was beautiful. - Nothing went wrong ! - Even my mother behaved herself. Do you think she knew what was happening ? I don't know. Perhaps she did. Poor Edward... Steady. Get it. Bastard. Now, give it here. Listen, I've decided. If we have a girl, she'll be called Chloe. Yes, it's beautiful. Damn. Ignore it. You ought to look. Evening, sir. Dinner what you ordered. Not this early... Ma'am. - Careful. - Sir. No, perhaps... The windows closed a bit. Not that much. - Oh, right you are. - A bit more. - And push the curtains back. - Certainly, sir. - Facing each other. - Yes, sir. The chairs. - It's very good actually. - Thank you very much, sir. Are you... Are you going to stand there the whole time ? We do the silver service on the beef, sir, and then we all retire. - I love you. - And I... Thank you. You ever feel the need for anything, sir, just pull on the string. Hard. And have a very nice one, sir. Yes. Good night. Yes. Sorry. Thank you. Girls. Girls, can you come down ? I need your help. Oh, God... - In the garden, please. Marjorie. - She was up there. She could hear me. - Harriet. - That's all right. Come on, Harriet, Dad wants us. In the garden, quickly. She could understand me. She was listening to me. I know. But she would also listen to you with your clothes on. No, but she needs the connection. The nights are shorter now, so she doesn't sleep so much. - But she won't come down. - No. She'll never come down. We're quite safe. Marjorie Mayhew. You'll get me thrown in prison. - Girls, help Mum get dressed. - Come on, Mum. Do you know, as you walk that way along the beach, the stones get bigger. Yes ? Well, over thousands of years storms have sort of graded the pebbles. So, when local fishermen come ashore at night they can tell exactly where they are. - That's the story, anyway. - We could go back out there. - You don't mean now. - Why not ? Take the wine, some fruit. It won't get dark for a long time. Yes, but I'm not sure we could just leave all this... I'm not awfully hungry after that lunch. Yes, but Flo, they've gone to a lot of trouble. We can't just... I know, but it looks so beautiful out there... But we're here... In here... And you're so beautiful. I keep thinking how beautiful you are, and... - I suppose you're right. About... - Oh, God. - Sorry. Am I being a bully ? - Of course, you're not. I could get them to bring back that plate warmer thingy. And we could go out for as long as you like. No, I'm just being silly. Edward, I don't think I could bear to have them back in here. - It won't take a minute. - Edward, please, no ! God... We're having our first row. - Florence, we're not. - We are. Because I'm being selfish. - We're not. You're not being selfish. - We are. And it's all my stupid fault. And what are they saying, your Aldermaston lot, about this wonderful wall in Berlin last month ? - Awkward for the lefties, isn't it ? - We hate it. Everyone hates it. An entire country turned into a prison camp, with the Soviet's blessing. - A proud day for socialism. - How was school ? A million Russian troops spread along the border. What prevents them from sending their tanks across the north German plain ? - Common sense, I should think. - Common sense ? Nonsense ! It's the bomb, the one you want to ban. Communism, as it proudly proclaims, is an expansionist creed. It's our nuclear bombs that deter them. It's as simple as that, my dear. We need a deterrent. Remember a couple of months ago I said I met this chap at a CND meeting? - I've asked him round tomorrow for tea - Chap ? - Is he a beatnik ? - No. - Beard and sandals ? - No. - What does he do ? - He's a beatnik. Shut up. He's like me, just finished his degree. - What college ? - UCL. But darling, that's London. For the sons of tradesmen. Florence ! - They produce decent engineers. - Well, exactly. - What does his father do ? - Is he working class or one of us ? Yes. I think that's more or less what I mean. His dad's headmaster of a primary school in Henley. And what does your young man intend doing with himself ? I haven't researched his prospects. I haven't worked out his precise socioeconomic status. I haven't arranged to marry him. I've asked him for tea. For tea. Jolly good. Pass the new green... What are we calling them ? Mangetout. I would say it was the day I bought my first railway ticket. I must have been 13. When I joined the queue my heart was thumping. I'd rehearsed my lines in the bedroom, the night before, like a big speech in a Shakespeare play. And then it was my turn and I said in a tiny shaking voice, "May I please have a half single to London ?" Not a single mistake ! Then I was walking towards the barrier with the ticket in my hand and I thought, "This is it. "I've done it, I've joined the big world, I'm a grown-up !" Well, mine... It was the time when I learned what really happened to my mum. So now we have Holman Hunt on loan to New York, Burne Jones on loan to Edinburgh, so I decided not to move the Titians or Rubens, as requested. But to bring up from store two glorious Uccellos... - I don't know Uccello. - Oh, darling ! Glorious. A fifteenth-century pioneer of perspective, a mathematician in fact... - Better stand back a bit. - And wonderful at animals. Birds. Landscape. Trees in their natural color. You, Lionel, you especially would love it... I'd grown up with the way she was. Taken her for granted. We all did. But when he used this horrible phrase, everything changed. Brain-damaged. Suddenly I saw her the way other people did. That must have been awful. You're always very kind to her. My mother just pretends to be brain-damaged. Funny thing, it was a sort of release. I felt this... This space opening up around me. She was brain-damaged, and I wasn't. I wasn't her, I wasn't my family, I was me. I felt kind of excited, like my life had just begun. Ed ! Second post. Looks like the one ! - Big moment, eh ? - Terry, I think I'll... Tell me tomorrow. And good luck. I don't believe it. Mum. Mum, listen. Are you listening ? This isn't how she looks now. This is the future. A new thing. A special camera that tells you how she'll look one day. This is important. Put that down for a moment. Listen to me. I got a first, Mum. A first class degree. That's right, son. I saw you. I was watching. Now you tell me. Yellow, like this has two things. A meaning and a number. Now I know the number... - Seven, Mum. - Seven. I can't remember the meaning. - Anne ? - Up here. - Harriet ? - What ? - Anne, Harriet, I got a first. - Is that good ? - It's the best. - Dad'll be happy then. - When's he back ? - 8:00. - 9:00. - 9:00. You two should be outside. It's beautiful. - Too hot. - Too boring. Hello. Is Toby there ? When are you expecting him ? Mrs. Davenport ? Edward Mayhew, a university friend of Henry's. Is he there ? Finland ? Just consider it for a moment, Florence. If it fell on St. Giles, the crater would be half a mile across, a hundred feet deep, and the city would be uninhabitable for 1,000 years because the radioactivity. - Hello. - Hello. Would you like one ? It's all about a hydrogen bomb landing on Oxford. Can't think of anything better. Do you mind if I tell you something ? - I've got to tell someone. - Tell me. I say, do we know you ? - I heard I got a first in history. - That's fantastic. - Let's get on with handing these out. - All right. So, it's a series of history books, not about the great men, but about the minor figures at their side, the bit-part players who fade away. Like the man who rode non-stop from London to Edinburgh to tell the king of Scotland that Elizabeth was dead and he was now the king of England. I think that's a brilliant idea. I thought everything would be clear as soon as my result came through. But it isn't. I'm still just hanging around. Like me. I could play in this awful dance orchestra in a hotel near Slough. But what I really want is to work with my quartet. - What's that ? - Two violins, viola, cello. We're called the Ennismore Quartet. Then Daddy would have to support me, and he and I don't exactly... - What did you get ? - What ? - In your music degree. - Well, actually, same as you. - To Miss Florence... - Ponting. To Miss Florence Ponting. In acknowledgment of your fine achievement. Well done. Thank you. Florence, look... I love you. And you're so... I mean, I need to kiss you. I love you, too. And I... I... What is it, darling ? Nothing. Edward... - What ? - Sorry. What is it ? Well... I just thought... You know, it isn't awfully comfortable here when we could... Oh, you mean... Yes, of course, let's... Come on then. If I just take this off then... We could go on the bed and... - Well... - Then, I think I'll... My shoes. I'll do it. It'd be better. So, come on. Why do you love him ? One. Aren't you going to take notes ? - One, he's not like anyone else. - No one is. You'd be surprised. Two, he always has a history book in his pocket and a pencil stub. Three, he knows the names of trees and flowers and constellations. And he wears plimsolls, never shoes. - And his socks never match. - Exactly. And he doesn't know the difference between a croissant and a baguette. - That's why I love him ! - You know what Mummy called him ? God. What ? I heard her on the phone to Iris Murdoch. And she said he was a bit of a country bumpkin ! That's him. You set eyes on me for the first time... And I saw a man who wasn't wearing a jacket. What then ? Loose shirt, sleeves rolled up to the elbows, tails hanging out. Nonsense. Trousers with a mend in the knee, and long hair, almost over your ears. - What else ? - All right. I liked the way you stopped in the doorway and looked around at everyone as if you owned the place. Proud. No, I mean, bold. I just needed to tell someone, anyone, that I'd got a first. Then you saw me and decided to stare me out. You glanced at me and decided I wasn't worth a second look. Did you think then it was love at first sight ? Well ? Actually, I'm beginning to think it was. It'll do for now. - What's this ? - Quintet ? You said I should decide on the next piece... - It means getting in another viola. - Another person. - It'll change everything. - It's too soon. Say hello to Elsbeth, in her third year, awfully good. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Right then, we'll begin. Charles, your big moment. So I see. Take it a little slower than marked. Again. It's tender. Like a question. It's a series of questions. People think you're shy, but the fact is you're rather tough, aren't you ? - Can I buy you that drink ? - Oh, I'm late for work. All artists to the green room, please. One minute please, Florence. Use the wrist, Florence. Half a turn each time, it's not that complicated. Do you want to know a secret ? Yes. Actually, I'm a little bit scared. I think I am, too. - I could... - For God's sake, just hold still. Turn around. - Please don't tear it... - Oh, bloody hell ! Such a clumsy idiot. I can't even do the simplest thing. A zip ! There's something wrong with me. Look, let's sit on the bed. You get so cross sometimes. You look like you want to hit someone. - Do I ? - Your face goes quite frightening. - Tell me something. - You have beautiful legs and... No, not that. Not about me. "With my body I thee worship..." You used to get into fights, didn't you ? You told me. Tell me about the last time you got in a fight. It was terrible. You don't want to hear about that. I do. I need to know your worst side. All right. Well, it was in my final year. Saturday night. I went to the Hundred Club. I was there with this chap, cleverest person in our year, I have no idea what he was doing there. He hated loud music. - Susie's tits are bigger. - Lucy's tits aren't so big. If you want to go all the way with a girl in the History department... Or the English department... - First you've got to meet her parents. - And then you've got to marry her. I think I'll head off. Late night meeting of the Philosophy Society. Philosophy. That's great. I'll come with you. I really admired Harold and, wanted him to take me seriously. And the point about Gabriel Marcel is this. As individuals, we're all seeking harmony in our transient lives and we find it through what he called secondary reflection. Philosophical inquiry was based on wonder and astonishment, and being open to the presence of others. Jewboy ! - What did you just say ? - Edward, don't. Someone call the police ! Oh, my God, look what you've done to him ! You brute ! You mad or something ? Really ! He avoided me after that. Call an ambulance ! He never spoke to me again. My dad says things about Jews. Drives me nuts. Why do you think he never spoke to you again ? I think he was ashamed of me. I'd always been in fights. In playgrounds, or outside pubs after kicking-out time. - So dangerous and stupid. - People said I was good at it. - I was proud of myself. - And then ? And then I didn't want to be a prize-fighting yokel anymore. - I wanted to be cool, like Harold. - You are. And now you've got to promise your wife. No more fights. Ever. Promise. Can I ask you something ? - I want to take your stockings off. - Well, I think I'd better do it. So brown. It was that day I walked from Henley. One mile. Wicket will want rolling again before tomorrow. It'll be done, Mr. Rammage. Florence ! How did you get here ? How long have you... I took the train to Henley and walked through the woods. I had a map. Didn't get lost once. Seven miles. And then I ate an orange by the wall near the church, looking down across the valley and checked the map and I thought, "He's only one mile away now, and I've never been so happy in my life." - Straight. - Sorry. No ! - Was that good ? - It was good. - Did I do a good job ? - Yes. - You happy ? - Very. Good. Work to do. - There ! Did you see it ? - Yellowhammer ? No ! It was going fast and low over there. - Greenfinch ? - Sparrowhawk. Honestly, Florence, the only ones you ever get right are robins. - And blackbirds. - What am I to do with you ? Come on. This way. Almost home. Florence, she won't remember you. You say that every time. She might one day. But she can list every painting in the Ashmolean. Marjorie, hello, it's Florence. - I've come to see you. - Why me ? I've done nothing wrong. I've brought you something interesting. From the museum. We talked about it before. You told me things I never knew. Uccello. The Hunt in the Forest. His last. Look at that perspective. You told me that when he was young he painted his fields blue in protest at the boring food. Vasari says the Abbot gave him cheese soup followed by cheese pie every day ! I thought we could paint it, make a copy together. - A forgery ! - I'll make some tea. There are two more in here. Sprouting, but they'll do. Peel 'em and chuck 'em in. Then we're going to do something about this floor. Is there a bucket or... Florence ! - We've got something to show you. - Come in here. It's beautiful. It really is. - We helped. I did some green. - So did I. And brown. - But it was Mum. - It was truly Mum. In Uccello the horses know everything. They were wild once, but they've swapped sides. They're with the hunters. They feel guilty. You can see it in their eyes. Beautiful. Good old Mum. We love you, Florence. - Come on, Edward. Lots to do. - Thank you. Isn't that Florence a lovely girl ? - Is she the one who gives me a bath ? - No, sweetheart. Edward's friend. Anne, can you put the spoons on the table, please ? Harriet, right over there. And the spoons go next to the knife. Marjorie, do you want to come and sit down ? Yes, dear. Mum, you're sitting over here. I'll sit here. Marry that girl. And Florence can sit here, and Edward can sit here. I'm so glad you're here, my dear. I've been wanting to try this out. Rabbit stewed in plums. All day on a low heat. - You're a marvelous cook, darling. - It smells delicious. Do you know, I make all our own jam, marmalade, chutney. It never stops. - And you do a wonderful job. - I do my best. - Do you have children of your own ? - No. - Sort of tickles. - It's all right. - I want to ask you something. - Yes ? How many girls have you, you know... The truth is, not many really. - How many then ? - Just some. Six ? Yes, about that, or... I don't know. Four ? Do you think it was four ? Flo, it's a... I think it's a matter of definition. - And what were their names ? - Why are we talking about... Well, there are no names. You're the first. You are the first. She used to play Cinderella, but she took to drugs, narcotics, and excessive alcohol. Now, she couldn't even play the wick in Aladdin's lamp. And now I have a short scene from the famous film Dracula. That girl died. That was the vampire strangling his, I mean her victim. And now we have Fascination by van Gogh which now hangs in the Louvre gallery in Paris. Fascination. - Who's that fellow over there ? - Just someone. - Looks a bit rough. - Let's start, shall we. Charles ? Did you like it ? You looked like you'd fallen asleep. Asleep ? No, honestly. I loved it. I often listen with my eyes closed. Look, I can even sing it. All right. I take it back. Come on. I want to show you where I used to work. This is where the performers wait to go on stage. And afterwards I'd serve them drinks here. I once made a cup of tea for Benjamin Britten. - Oh, yes, the famous... - And this peephole. I'd hear the applause and watch like this, and when the players started to leave the stage, I'd have to open it smoothly, without being seen. Can you imagine the terror and the thrill of stepping out here to play your first concert. - These are discerning audiences. - Yes, it would be something... I just know the Ennismore will play here one day. And when we do, I'll choose the Mozart Quintet, the one you can sing. Yes. Yes. We'll play it beautifully. The critic from The Times will be there. We'll triumph. And it will be yours, it'll be specially for you. It's my promise. And I'll be here. Dead center, three rows back. Ready to shout at the end. - What is it they shout ? - Bravo. Bravo ! Bravo the Ennismore Quartet ! This is where I'll be, Florence, this very seat. Number 9, row C. And that is my promise. This was recorded in Berlin. I've never heard a stereophonic thingy before. What's the point of it ? You hear the whole spread of an orchestra. Violins on the left, double basses on the right, and everything in between. Stand here, close your eyes... You know what an octave is. Now you're going to hear the greatest octave leap there ever was. I love you ! Florence ? Flo ? Just... Florence, don't move, okay ? Florence ? All right. Let me put this another way. You don't seem quite as happy as you should. In love, as you say, getting married in the summer. No, I am honestly. I'm very happy. Something's bothering you, Flo. It could be the quartet, the cellist, Charles Morrell. I think he's a bit taken with me, keeps asking me out. That's easy. Now you've got a fiancé. Well, you see, I don't want the quartet to know. They'll think I'm leaving, they'll panic. That's not it though, is it ? - I'm just being silly. - Could you not talk to your mother ? - I should go. - Stay just a little longer. There's something... Sit down. There's something I want to say. You can change your mind. So your father's ordered a marquee, your mum's getting measured for dress, the invitations are at the printers. Flo, these are minor details, trifles compared to what's at stake. - It's not too late to turn back. - I have to go. I'm giving a lesson. No. God ! No, I mean, hell. Sorry, I didn't mean to say that. I'm sorry. This is a mess. "This pleasurable excitement "causes the penis to fill with blood and become engorged..." Oh, God. "Secretes a clear substance to lubricate the mucous membrane." "And now the foreplay is concluded. "He lies on top of her, "and it is perfectly acceptable for her to use a hand gently to guide her husband in." "And at last he enters her." Enters me. "He enters her, and this is known as penetration." - Flo ? - Enter. You may enter me. - What ? - Nothing. - Are you all right ? - I'm feeling rather sick. - What are you reading ? - A sex manual. Flo ! Because of Edward ? What does it say ? It says women are like doorways. Men can enter through them. That's so ridiculous ! That simply isn't true. I'm afraid it is. - What else does it say ? - You won't like this. It says the penis... - The penis fills with blood. - Blood ? - No sign of Daddy ? - No. That's just typical. I've got my Spinoza supervision now, so, Ruth, no running in the hall, and Florence, could you delay your screeching until after tea ? Come on, Flo, it's easy. Just point and choose. But you're not meant to see it. - What about this one ? - No. Awful. Too creamy and frilly. I want something simple. - And white. - White ? - Can I help you young people ? - We're late for rehearsal. Thank you. - You all right ? - Yes. - I love you. - I love you. Edward, tell me something. Say something. No, say something stupid like you used to. Miss Ponting, you have a clavicle and a philtrum that all men wish to play on, and a vibrato that all men adore, but you're entirely mine, and I'm so very glad and proud. In that case, you may kiss my vibrato. Such hard calluses for so soft a woman. And my philtrum... There. Is that all right ? Am I squashing you ? No, not really. Sorry. It just... I need to... I can't quite... - Just lie still. - Sorry. If you could... - I know, I'm trying. - If you could just lift a little. I know. I'm trying to. I just... I can't quite... "He lies on top of her and it is perfectly acceptable for her to use a hand gently to guide her husband in." - Florence. - In here. It's too... What is it ? - What is it ? - Oh, my God ! Don't look at me ! Please don't look at me ! Stop looking at me ! Edward. - Here at last. - Sorry I'm late. - No one would stop for me. - Oh, they're idiots. Perhaps I should get a haircut. Or a new jacket. Come and see your room. This time Mummy's put you in the small room, right at the top. - As far away from me as possible. - Very sensible. It's enormous. You're beautiful. Put your arms right round me. I like that. Daddy wants to show you the factory. The job. - Let me kiss your vibrato. - Stupid. Do you think you can be a salesman and write history books ? Someone's got to try it. And the insurance came through. You're allowed to drive the Humber. And Ruth says you're playing tennis with Daddy. - I'm hopeless. It's ridiculous. - That's not what you said at dinner. - I know, but, I... - He'll want to thrash you. Let him. But you're mine now. I want to thrash him. Don't you dare. Did Florence tell you ? I'll give her a couple of grand. Get you both started. - That's awfully... - You any good by the way ? - I'm pretty useless, actually. - Everyone says that. I expect you're thinking because you're young you're going to slaughter me. Well, my friend, think again. Anyway, here it is. Old Ministry of Defense place. Bought it for a song. Cost less than my boat. Mostly specialist stuff made to order for labs. This oscilloscope is being adapted for Oxford's engineering department. A lot of our work is for universities. But we could do more. Perhaps spend a couple of months here learning what we do, get your mind round some basic electronics. Then you'll go round to universities, explain our services, drum up business for us. You'll even have your own office. Will I have a desk ? Six love. Two sets to me. One more ? - I think I'd rather just go inside... - Your serve. Come on, man. See if you can get a game. Just one game. - Out ! - In. - Love fifteen. - I know. Thirty-forty. One-four. For God's sakes, man. Come on ! Match point. That's it ! Six love, six love, six one. I have to say it. That return of serve, the drop shot was a complete fluke. Well, no, actually, I've been working on that one. My, God, Florence ! How long have you been there ? Not long at all. I thought I'd just... I asked you a question, damn it. How long ? - About 5 minutes. - About ? What the hell do you think you're up to ? Did I invite you to spy on me ? Well ? Answer me ! There you are. Did you really need to come this far ? Yes. - It must be 2 miles back to the hotel. - I needed to get out. Look, this is ridiculous. It was unfair of you to run out like that. - Was it ? - Yes. - In fact, it was bloody unpleasant. - Yes. - What do you mean, "Yes" ? - You know exactly what I mean. It was absolutely revolting. You don't have the faintest idea how to be with a man, do you ? If you did, it would never have happened. In all this time, you've never let me near you. You've never let me... You don't know a thing about any of it, do you ? - Please don't bully me. - I'm not bullying you. - Yes, you are. Edward, you are ! - You're talking bloody nonsense. You're the one who stopped us getting close. When we hold hands you think you're doing me a favor. You're so stuck up ! - Is that what you think ? - Yes, it bloody well is what I think. Then why are you here ? Why are you chasing me down the beach ? Why can't you let me just sit here by myself ? Edward, I want to make you happy. But I think I'm always a disappointment. You're always advancing, I'm always backing away. And we can't talk about it. We can never just be happy. Or just be. You're always demanding something more, and I'm useless at... And you go silent and unhappy and it's all my fault. And when I say yes to something even if I don't really want to, I know there'll be another thing that I'm expected to do. - I'm no good at these demands. - Demands ? - Well, what I mean is... - You think I'm a debt collector. I hope you're not talking about money. - Of course, I'm not. - That's it, isn't it ? Money ? - Honestly, I wasn't talking about... - I don't care about money... - I didn't mention money, Edward. - So keep your money. You think I demanded that job from your father ? It was your idea. Do you know what ? I don't want to work for him. - Tell him I've changed my mind ! - I know you don't mean that. - It's just because you're feeling... - I bloody well do ! But why did you run off like that ? You shouldn't have done that. I've already told you. - You wanted to humiliate me. - No, honestly. It's something... I can't explain it. I don't know what it is, why I ran away. I got in such a state. - I was ashamed... - So you humiliated me. All right, then. If that's what you want ! I was trying to humiliate you. It's no less than you deserve when you can't even control yourself. You're a bitch talking like that ! Edward, please go away. We could be so free with each other. We could make each other so happy. Instead, we're in this mess. Yes. - Meaning what exactly ? - It's a mess. It's hopeless. Is it ? Is it a nightingale ? It's a blackbird. - As late as this ? - It must be a prime site he's on. He's doing overtime, having to work hard. Like me. Edward, no, please. There's something I want to say to you. - It's not... - What ? - You know I love you. - Still ? I want to spend my life with you. And you feel the same. We love each other, and we can set each other free. Edward, it must be obvious to you by now that I'm... - Florence, what is it ? - That I'm pretty hopeless. No, I'm absolutely hopeless at sex. I'm no good at it. I don't seem to need it like other people, like you do. I might change, but I can't imagine it. If I don't say this now we'll always be struggling with it. It's going to cause you a lot of unhappiness, and me, too. - I don't understand what you're... - Mummy knows two homosexuals. They live in a flat together, like man and wife. Two men. In Oxford, in Beaumont Street. They both teach at the University. And we can live by our own rules too, Edward. I can say this because I know you love me. We don't have to be like everyone else. We could live together. No one would know what we did or didn't do. We'd be together, and if you wanted, really wanted, that's to say, whenever it happened, and, of course, it would happen, I'd understand, more than that, I'd want it. Because I want you to be happy and free. I'd never be jealous, as long as I knew that you loved me. Oh, God. Honestly, my darling, I just want to be with you all my life, look after you, be happy with you, and work with the quartet, and one day at Wigmore Hall play something glorious, beautiful for you like the Mozart. Have I got this right ? - You want me to go with other women. - Not if you didn't want to. Have you actually forgotten that we were married today ? We're not two old queers living in secret on Beaumont Street. We're man and wife ! "With my body I thee worship !" That's what you promised today. In front of everybody ! Are you so innocent and stupid that you don't realize how disgusting and ridiculous your idea is ? And what an insult it is ? An insult to me ! You tricked me. You're a fraud. And I know what else you are. Do you know what you are ? Frigid. That's what. Completely frigid. You thought you needed a husband, and I was the first bloody fool to come along. Edward ? Hello, Edward, love. Have you been at work ? - But where's Florence ? - Oh, my God, son. - What about all those presents ? - They'll all be sent back. Dad's writing to Mrs. Ponting. - Why can't we see Florence ? - We love her. Why won't you tell us what's happened ? One day when you're grown up, you'll understand. I want you to make me a promise, a really solemn promise. That you'll never ever mention her name to me again, or ask me any more questions about her. Do you understand ? Hands on hearts. - Edward. This is so stupid. - I mean it. And the job. We'll have to write to Mr. Ponting. I already have. I've had a letter back from Florence's mother. - Here, you'd better read it. - I'd rather not. Well... Anyway, it's agreed. Non consummation. Come on, son. Is there really nothing you want to tell me ? Are you sure ? Eddy. - Look at this. - What ? Does that list not look familiar to you ? - We have all these records already. - What ? I don't know what they've done here. It's a mess. Looks like they've sent last month's order. And this month's. They got it totally mixed up. Well, we'll just have to separate them out, and call, what's his name ? Bob. He could come by this afternoon. Excuse me. Do you have any Chuck Berry ? Sure. - Didn't we have this problem before ? - Reckon we did. Let's see... How about a "Best of" ? That's perfect. You don't look the sort to be into this kind of thing. It's not for me. It's for my mum's birthday. She's pretty old. She's going to be 36. It's not so old really. She only listens to classical music but she does like Chuck Berry. Me too. She always says he's bouncy and merry. She'll be so surprised. But how much is it ? I've only got 75p. Oh, it's... It's okay. You can have it. I want you to have it. - Are you really sure ? - Yes. Amazing. And thank you. I'll put my money into your charity... No, no. There is no need... Just... Just tell her, you know... - Tell her "happy birthday." - But happy birthday from who ? From... You know, from the shop. Bye then. And thanks again. You're really nice. Wait. You haven't told me your name. Chloe. Chloe Morrell. Bye. - So she borrowed this bike... - Nah, she stole it. Went shooting down the hill, to his mother's house and said, "Look, here's your money back." It's not always like that. I knew this couple once. Very straight. Sort of innocent and young. And she was very beautiful. So they get married, you know, the whole conventional thing. Church and cake. Honeymoon in a hotel by the sea... And on the big night, it doesn't quite work out, in bed. And she gets really upset. And she tells him that she's not really into sex. That when they live together, he can have it with anyone he likes. - Anyone but her. - What an offer. - Does she love him ? - Yes. She does. She really does. But that's the thing, you see, he doesn't get it. He shouldn't have listened. He should have slipped her one on the beach. - Typical. - You're so sensitive. He's too angry. He doesn't see that... Well, the thing is... She really loves him. And she doesn't want to let him down. But she wants to be with him, and she wants him to be happy. So, it all comes apart that night on the beach. They never... They never see each other again. Married for six hours. - What happened to her ? - I don't know. I guess she... I don't know. All right. Here we go. Didn't even see it. Too damn slow. Almost half a century ago, four students at the Royal College of Music began to meet informally to play some favorite pieces and improve their ensemble technique. The result was the now celebrated Ennismore Quartet. This October at Wigmore Hall in London, they'll present a program of Mozart, Beethoven and Britten to celebrate 45 years of great music making. A performance given even greater significance by the recent announcement that this will be Ennismore's farewell concert. Yesterday, at their Primrose Hill home, I spoke to violinist Florence Morrell and her husband Charles, the cellist, asking them first how hard it had been to reconcile a successful domestic existence, three children, five grandchildren, with the demands of international... Thank you, darling. Bye, Mum. Best of luck. Bye, Dad. Best of luck. - There you go, Dad. - Thanks, my boy. Mom, we are so proud of you both. Bravo. I am sorry, Edward. I am most terribly sorry. Let's go back now... Together. Edward ? ON CHESIL BEACH THE END
