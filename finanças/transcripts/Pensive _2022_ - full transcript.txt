Or... "creative industries"? But wait, there's also "entertainment industries"! Oh, Marius, check this out. You there? Listen. Business information systems. Right up your alley, right? "The aim of the program is to train highly skilled professionals who are able to embrace change, stay resilient, and objectively assess business and technical innovation." Sounds like the most boring thing ever. Look. How does this look? - Oh, risky. - Do I look like an old man? You know, if you don’t take risks... Your jokes are as bad as your tie. Stand straight. Who didn’t pitch in yet? - Briga, will there be a grill? - This is for me and Modė. - And I wanted to ask... - Beause you know, I... I wanted to ask about the rooms. Can me and Modė somehow get a private room? I prepared some meat for grilling. All questions go to Rimas, OK? He booked the spot. - OK, so where is he anyway? - I don't know. I’m not his mom. - Here you are. - Nice tie. Where's the rest? - So how much is it? - 50. 50 euros? You serious? Where is this place? In Luxembourg? - Here, that’s all I have. - Thanks. - So you really don't know anything? - Where's Marius? - There. - Marius, what about you? I decided I'm not going. - What do you mean? - I just... I don't want to anymore. Marius, what do you mean you're not going? Even Saulė is coming. Maybe we'll hear her speak for the first time. What about my kebabs? You missed them last time, so this time too? Sorry. What the fuck? It's nothing. What the fuck? I would like to wish this year's class one thing. Be the hunters. Not the prey. THE FUTURE AWAITS So, you want everyone to beg you? Nobody will even notice that I'm not there. Have you seen this place? Why do you want to go there so bad? You don't even like them. Žygimantas, do us a favor. Make our school famous. Not only in Lithuania, but around the world. Good luck! Exactly! Can you even imagine how crazy it's going to be? Marius! It's going to be crazier than my wildest dreams. Have you read the description? "Comfortable mattress, fresh air, sandy bitch." VAIDA POCIŪTĖ Have you ever seen a lake like that in Lithuania? You see conspiracies everywhere. Since they're always hanging out together... they'll also get their diplomas together. Good luck, girls. It's the last chance, Marius. I mean... We'll never see them again. BRIGITA... Brigita either. EMILIJA RŪDYTĖ What do you mean? Well, what could I mean? Understand? A low-cut dress won't get you anywhere in life. Rimas is moving to the States. You think Brigita's going to go after him? Titas! Titas Mataitis! I don't know why, but when I see Titas, I always cheer up. TITAS! You have to take initiative for once. And finally, I give you... our honor student - our fastest, strongest, tallest... Rimas Meiliūnas! Congratulations. Let's take a picture. RIMAS, RIMAS... It's no secret that you're expected to be drafted into the NBA... as the highest pick in Lithuanian history. - Your life story is so moving, too. - Well, yes, my childhood wasn't easy. After my parents died, I was raised by my grandmother. But you and Rimas are buddies, right? What? You hang out with him, right? - I didn't congratulate you. - Thanks. He seems like such a down-to-earth guy. It's not easy to go through so much pain as a child. And so here I am today. What? - I said, yeah. - Everybody, get over here. - Rimas, what a suit. - Thanks. - So handsome. - Listen, my first question is... How’s my wife? I hope you didn't hurt her or anything? If he's talking about his meat... I want to talk about the sleeping arrangements. Guys, relax. You graduated today. Let me take care of the rest, OK? Enjoy it. Have you seen the pictures of that place? Why do you care? You're not even going. It's just that it doesn't even look like it's in Lithuania. Rimas, do you know the address? Because it's not listed. - They said they'd send it. - So why don't you give them a call? Maybe they've already sent the address? OK, if you don't trust me, I'll call them right now. The person you have called is unavailable right now. Say cheese! Why don't you call again? - Well? - Same thing. - So what? No party? - Look at the camera! - What do you mean? - What the hell, Rimas? 50 euros! We won't find anything else, everything is booked. Smile, people - smile! Nobody wants to buy it. So what can I do? Take a look. OK, I get it. It's because of that fire. I don't know... Maybe we should lower the price. Vida closed on a place nearby last week. You know, Marius, your mom and I were thinking about your future. Have you heard of risk insurance? So what am I supposed to do? Wait. You see, this is a future-proof business. If something happens, you need insurance. Well... If your neighbors flood you, you need insurance. If a pole falls on your car - you also need insurance. Just think about all the hurricanes, floods and pandemics to come. This is the age of force majeure. Risks everywhere, and you need insurance everywhere. So I think you need to turn misfortune into fortune. It's simple, really. Hello? Yes. Oh, so you're not going to buy that cottage. But have you been inside the actual cottage? Have you seen the view through the window? Oh, that happened so long ago. But I understand. That's too bad. So leave the key under the tree stump. Mom, how much can you talk? It's our kid's graduation. I'm done. Look. You know, Marius, I'm serious about this. I can see that you know how to assess what's risky and what's safe. I think you have a talent for it. Is there anyone even working here? Hello? Can someone help us? Don't shout, why are you shouting? We're sitting here, talking about life. Are you in a hurry? - Let's enjoy the moment. - OK, let's enjoy it. Let's enjoy it. And while we're talking about life, someone... DISHWASHER NEEDED WHO'S THIS? STILL UP FOR A PARTY? Dear students. Today our destination... is a place of great cultural heritage. A place of great historical importance. It may frighten some people and give others food for thought. But I can promise you that it definitely won't leave you indifferent. Dear students, we are going to a cottage that Marius pulled out from fuck knows where! Careful. - Damn, I'm so excited about this. - Me too. Really. I mean, Laima would have jumped out of the window if there was no party. - For real, yeah. - Word. It's just too bad that Žygis isn't going. The smarter the person, the bigger the problems. He can't even sleep until he hears back from the university. Yeah... Marius, can you move the seat up a little? Looks like it's broken. Do you know if the place has electricity? - I got a massive sound system. - Yeah? I don't know about electricity. What, you've never been there? No. So, an illegal rave? I've never seen this side of you before. - What's wrong? - It's not showing anything. No big deal. Let's just pick a random direction. I'll restart it, maybe that'll help. Marius, who owns this cottage? I don't know. Nobody does now. This is by Algis Motiejūnas. You saw a piece of wood in the middle of nowhere... and you know who carved it? Everyone wrote about it. The family burned to death. Only the husband survived, and then he started carving really strange sculptures. There were things on TV about him. He embodied the suffering of the nation and the individual. You're a real fucking expert on some old man’s “wood”, aren't you? Laima, leave her alone. - Carvers, my ass. - No, it's really cool. Marius did his best and found us a place to party. Maybe it's not the same one? - I don't know. - Maybe it's not the same? I don’t know about you... but I don't want to party where someone died. People, let’s get moving. Should we go or should I just get drunk here? Do we know where to go, Marius? - Yeah, we do. - Good, super. Not bad. I don't know. The one I found was better. Yeah, right. It was like the Sheikh's palace. Too bad it's in Dubai. - Marius, do you have the keys? - Yeah. Vytas? Can you help? Marius, I don't think you can open the door with a tree stump. - Careful, easy. - Guys? - You sure no one lives here, because... - Vytas, can you help? Why don't you leave him alone? What's wrong with you today? There's nothing wrong with me. Is it something I did? No, just... Let’s party today and we'll talk later, OK? Saulė, you'd better put that back. So where are we going to sleep? Oh, shit. This is definitely the place that Saulė was talking about. Guys, come over here. Wow. Pretty smoked. Is that him? Mhm. - So what happened to him? - He killed himself, I think. Really? Hey, Darius? Can you give me some of that foil? Yes. And what if he... It's a helmet for you, maybe you'll feel safer now. Look, we're not going to sit inside after all. Exactly. OK, there's a lot to do. Darius, go marinate your meat. Marius? Maybe there's a cliff or a hill around here somewhere? I want to greet the sun in the morning. There is a cliff around here somewhere. But... It's actually pretty amazing, but I don't know where exactly. OK, I'll find it. - Go. - Where? Where? To find a cliff for Brigita. What are you doing? I'm fucking awesome. What? Repeat three times: "I'm fucking awesome." Then go. - Fuck off. - Fuck off, fuck off! I like slim cigarettes, the blue ones. She says they're gay. So I bite off the tip. Wow, right? It's really beautiful. That's it. This stage is over. Can you believe it? After today, everyone's going to scatter all over the world. Laima's going to study fashion design in Paris, Darius is going to be a chef somewhere in England. And Vytas? Vytas wants to become a theater director. Nice, it suits him. And you? I'm still thinking about it. I have a few options. Sorry, I shouldn't have asked. I don't know myself what I want to study. I know it's annoying when everyone asks. It doesn't matter what you're going to study. Let's go, the party's about to start. It's not that bad right now. Depends on what you compare it with. What do you mean? If you compare it with Dresden when it was bombed... then it's really not bad at all. Michael Jackson after plastic surgery. Hitler after his confession. The toilet after beef stew and a double cheeseburger with onion rings. Bars after Covid. The sink after depilation. Gums after getting your teeth cleaned. - What? - You never had your teeth cleaned? - Why? - It shows. What?! Don't worry, it's not all that pleasant. - Yeah? - Mhm. Get out. Get the fuck out! 300 euros. 300 euros for pissing all over my seats! Hello! I made it! They call these Lambos. Super hard to get. The whole pack, hey... Žygis, are you fucking insane? You'll have to get your stomach pumped. So what? I'm OK. - Guys? - Marius! Want some beer?! - Go on, smoke it. - No, no... Drink it! Marius, relax. Hey hey hey!? Guys, don't get it on the windows. Marius relax. It's only champagne. Chill, it’s a party. People just want to celebrate. Everything OK? Fuck, don't take pictures, OK? Sorry, sorry, sorry. Dude, you know what would happen to me if the NBA saw this? Who's ready to atone for their sins? Oh, Revelation to DJ John. May I escort you to your altar? - We good? - Yeah, good. Marius, we're out of firewood. Someone has to go look for more in the woods. I can't go into the woods. We'll go. Don't cut down any trees, just pick some up from the ground. Let’s fucking go! Let’s party! - Want to try it? - No, thanks. - Are you drunk? - No. Me neither. Give me some, you've been drinking alone all night. All you have to do is ask. So tell me about your dark side. What dark side? I'm talking about your passion for old folk artists. - Oh, that one. - Uh huh, that one. So, yeah. Folk art turns me on. Folk art and carving. - Oh, wow. - Yeah. Are you saying you never read... when they write about all kinds of horrible things? Like the cannibal girls from Šiauliai. Or about that dude who killed his family and threw them in a well. Weirdly, it’s not my favorite pastime. You're lying. Everyone reads it. I'd rather you tell me what's hiding behind all those jokes of yours. Meaning? What jokes? I don't know. You always looked sad to me. So what? Is this my cue to tell you some sad story about my childhood? I don't know. Is it? What the fuck? Wow... What is this place? These are his works. His carvings. This is probably like an amusement park for you. Why don’t they have eyes? There's probably something they shouldn't see. What is this? Laima, where are we? What planet is this? I don't like it here, let's go somewhere else. The first time should be memorable, OK? I've never seen a stranger place, but I like it. You look really beautiful here. So beautiful that they all go: "Ahh! You look so beautiful!" I love you so much. - Let’s get comfy. - OK, guys, sorry. What the fuck? - It's us. Vytas and... - What the fuck are you doing here? - We're looking for firewood. - Yeah. The forest is fucking full of it. It's fucking funny to them. - Here, look! - These are sculptures. I don't give a fuck! Modė, come on. Let's get this piece of firewood to the party. Yeah, perfect timing. Fucking morons. OK, we're... going to go. Let me help you. Guys! Look what we found! What a piece of wood! The forest is full of branches, take this one back. Take it yourself if you don't like it. Come on, take it back. - Let's leave it here. - Fuck, they ruin everything. If we need wood for the grill, we can get it from the forest. We need firewood for the sauna too. OK, I can go to the forest and get firewood, but then... Rimas, let's take this back. Relax, dude. Tonight, there are no rules! Come on, faster! Dad, it hurts. Sorry for the vomit. Žygis? What? What the fuck are you doing? Where the fuck are you taking it? Marius, you haven't tried the meat yet. - Try it, Marius. - I don't want fucking want any. - Hey. - Hey! Have you thought about where you'll be in 10 years? - What kind of question is that? - I don't know. Just thinking, that's all. - OK. - So? In 10 years, it'll be like this: I'll have a husband. A wooden one. - He'll be, you know... - Good looking. - Mysterious. - Mysterious? Yeah. Like you never know what he's hiding. A serial killer? No. An alcoholic. Not very original. Usually he's very sweet, but... when he drinks, he gets aggressive and... - Beats you? - And how. He beat me for 10 years. Until one day his wife couldn't stand it anymore and... Maybe she needs help? I can kill my husband myself. - Saulė... - Vytas. I heard you have a problem. Is this him? - Yes. - I can see it in your eyes. Sit down. I'll take care of everything. OK. One blow. That's all it took. We need to get rid of the body. Vytas, it's a sculpture. Let it be. Fuck. I told you, don't take any fucking pictures! That's it, give me your phones. All of you, what don't you get? If you can't act like normal people, you'll get them back tomorrow. - Rimas. - What? Give me your fucking phones! Rimas, what are you doing? Calm down. You should understand best of all. My future depends on it. So don't do that if your future depends on it. You think you're so clever, huh? Fuck, at least you won't be such a smartass when I'm in the States. You know why? Because you won't be there! Hey, don't worry, we'll collect the phones. Shut your fucking mouth! What are you fucking staring at? Fucking thank you. Not too hot? No - it's bearable. Lay down. OK... What then? You'll like it. You'll see. Mind if we join you? Come over here. Why's it so cold in here? How are you? Did... Did Rimas do something? Rimas... Rimas, Rimas. No one could give a shit about me because it's all about Rimas. I can’t wait for him to leave for those States of his and never come back. Because I don't want to be with him anymore. Be gentle. Sorry. Now that's it, huh? Listen, is this really how it's supposed to be? Yeah, it's just the kind of firewood. No, it's too hot for me, I'm going to the lake. - Wait, it's just getting hot. - No, I don't want to stay here. Some kind of fumes... Hey, why doesn't the door open? Push it harder. I'm pushing, it won't open! Come over here! Help! Help! We're choking in here! Someone help, please! Fucking help! The door's jammed with a chisel. It’s full of fumes. - Marius, pull. - It's not opening. Someone come and help! Help! It won't open. Get the fuck out of the way. What's going on here? They're fucking dead. - I said not to go in there. - What the fuck! What happened? I told them. Marius... - Why didn't you do anything? - I was trying. Hey, calm down. No one's to blame, OK? We'll all go back to the cottage, I'll give everyone back their phones, and we'll call the police. What fucking cottage? Someone killed them! We have to get out of here - now! Darius, can you calm down? We're not going anywhere. They just got stuck in there. It was an accident. No one touch anything. Let's go. We have to stay together now. I'm going to get the phones. - How are you? - Super. When we were in 10th grade... you and Emilia got into a fight during phys. ed. What? This was your revenge. I was with you all night, you idiot. OK, OK, everyone needs to chill. Let's try to think straight. There are two options here. First is the revenge of the sculptures, that one's obvious. And the second is... Guys, let me in! Let me fucking in! What happened? Modė is out there... Calm down. Where is he? There's Modestas and some stranger with a mask, he tried to kill us. - To kill you? - Yes! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Someone is coming! Wait! There's Modestas! Laima, calm down! Marius, don’t. Quiet! Marius, open the door! What the fuck is happening here? Let me in! Laima, open the door! Marius, don’t - the killer will come inside. Laima, open the door! Run, run! He's coming... He's coming... Be quiet! Get away from the window. Quiet... Why didn’t you open the door? Why?! I thought our graduation party would be better. Darius, you know he's going to stab you with a skewer? Why? Does anyone have the car keys? Whose keys are these? Dude. One by one. Quiet! Calm down, Žygis! One by one! I don’t understand where we are. Just go. Hurry. Go! Are we all here? Stay calm! Wait, I want to go back! Fuck, this is a stick shift! You don't fucking know how to drive a stick? Rimas, drive! - He’s there! - Where? Shut up, Žygis! - Rimas, go! - Be quiet, OK? Saulė? Run to the forest, everyone get to the forest. Žygis, where are you running?! Run! Hey, faggot! Marius, what are you standing there for? Get the fuck out of here! Marius? Marius! Get over here. - Let's get out of here. - Have you seen Saulė? Fuck her, let's get out of here! So go, if you don't give a fuck. This isn't all about you. Vytas? - Vytas, Vytas. - What? I saw him catch Saulė. What? I saw her get caught. - Where? - By the cars. No. - Vytas. - No. We're still alive. We can try to escape. Vytas. Vytas. Fuck. Vytas. You only started hanging out with her today. You don’t fucking get it. Angry sir! Angry sir! You have serious issues. I’m here, angry sir! Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid! This is not a set-up. I just want to help you. - We just need... - Rimas? We need to show him some empathy, talk to him. Help me with him. He's normal for a second, then loses it again. - Let's just run away. - He's going to set Brigita on fire. - What? - Žygis figured it out. What you did to the sculpture, that's how you'll die. Karma and justice. Wait, Saulė didn't even touch the sculptures. - Fuck, Vytas. - Saulė didn't do anything, she's alive. He kills everyone he sees. - I saw it! - I personally threw up on the sculpture. - Marius and what did you do? - You seriously want to listen to him? It was dark, maybe you confused her for someone else. Fuck, Vytas. Now he's expecting us, we have to wait a little... And then come back and save everyone. Don't be idiots, let's get out of here. What about the others? What others? You saw what happened! - Let's just get out of here! - How do you know? OK, so what's your fucking plan? Go back to the cottage... find the phones and figure out who's still alive. That's crazy! - Vytas, tell him it's crazy. - I'm going. - Fuck, Vytas, let's get out of here. - Where? We have to leave Žygis somewhere. We can't leave him, he'll jump on the knife himself. - Vytas. - Nice rope. Give it to me. Vytas, let's just get out of here. - And what about me? - Like always. Fucking heroes. She's not here. Let's go. - It's me. - Marius, Marius. Where did you see her? Look, let's get inside. She could be anywhere. We'll find the phones. Maybe someone else is alive and has seen her. Žygis... Call the cops. Žygis, please be quiet. I'm really tired. Quiet. Call the cops. Hello? Can you hear me? - IS ANYONE STILL ALIVE? - There was a murder. A lot of murders. Some man came. To a cottage somewhere in Kurbiškiai. I'm not fucking kidding! Send someone! A man with a fucking chisel and a wooden mask. He killed the whole class. Send someone! He's coming! Hide! I AM. IN THE BURNED ROOM Hello. Help us! Run to the boat. Go! Guys! Get in the boat. He’s beating me. Žygis? Žygis, come here! Come here, come here! Žygis! Vytas! - Žygis, come here! - Vytas, get in the boat. - So you're not going to help him either? - There's no time. And when Rimas was lying there? You didn't have time either? Get in the boat. Žygis, come on! Get in! Can we switch? Can you hear me? What the fuck are you doing? I asked you a question. Can we switch places? We can. What's wrong with you? It's OK. - He won't reach us here. - I just... I just don't understand why he doesn’t touch you... Like he doesn’t see you. SAULĖ: IS ANYONE ALIVE I'M IN THE COTTAGE. - Vytas, what are you doing? - Going back. Vytas, no. - Get off. - Stop it! - Fuck, Vytas, we can't... - I said, get off! Stop it, please - sit down! Vytas, we're not going anywhere! - Get the fuck off. - Stop it! Thank you so much for the graduation party. It really was unforgettable. Good luck with him. A really great guy. Would never leave a friend in need. When you get a chance, ask him about Rimas. - What about Rimas? - Nothing. - Marius? What about Rimas? - Nothing! - What did you do to him? - Fuck! I didn't do anything! Saulė? - You're insane. - Saulė! So... What do you think, what comes next for us? What do you mean? I mean... Was this all a game.. or... Could this be something more serious? Because I think there’s something real between us. And maybe you'll laugh, but... For me... I like being with you. Not just that I like it... I feel good when I'm with you. Are you serious or is this a joke? I'm serious. You sure found a good time to talk about stuff like that. I think it's important to talk about how you feel. Because we might hurt each other in the future. I can't believe this. What? Marius, I was just sad. That's all. You don't like being with me? You don't feel safe with me? Safe? Our whole class was killed, Marius. But with me... With me you're safe. Fine. If you want to hash it out, we can hash it out. Marius, I couldn't even look at you all these 12 years. You are the most boring person in the world. You're worse than a loser. You're not a programmer, not even a gamer. They at least have hobbies. They have dreams, and you don't have anything. Your charisma is... You should google it. Marius, I kissed you so that... in the coming years of your miserable life... you'd have at least one moment that you could be proud of. At least one moment... that you could tell your children, your grandchildren, everybody about. How you kissed the prettiest girl in the class. Get the fuck out. Get off the boat right now. - You're serious? - Yes. Fucking get off the boat. Fucking now! Get the fuck out! - Serious? - Yes! Get off the fucking boat. Where the fuck are you swimming? This is my direction. You know what I just realized? That psycho doesn't touch you because even he finds you boring. DAD - Gosh, what time is it? - 4:30. Are you still partying? Marius, can you hear me? - Why did you call? - Oh, it's not... You probably heard about it yourselves. It's all over the news. That the Chicago Bulls are interested in drafting Rimas. I mean... A Lithuanian on Jordan’s team! Listen, you tell him that we're really proud... that our son was in his class! It's unreal, Marius. Your mom and I even raised a glass of champagne to him yesterday! And to you too, of course... Dumbshit! Where are you? Get the fuck over here! What? You think I'm boring too? Get the fuck over here! Is it because I didn't do anything to your sculptures? Fuck you! You're not interested in me? Fuck! Get the fuck over here! Get over here! Calm down. I can see that Lukutė is burned. I can see it. Don't interrupt when Daddy's singing. I know. I know that Gedutis is better at singing lullabies. I know. This boy will be Gedutis now. You'll have to be Gedutis, OK? If you're good... you can stay here. What's that, Lukutė? Sing a lullaby for Lukutė, she'll love it. Sing. Sing! Algis Motiejūnas is invited to his last dance. Algis, get over here! Where's Vytas? Let's go! - Let's go! - You go, I'll catch up. I don't give a shit if you stay here. Get off me, motherfucker! Get the fuck off! Father, I'm burning! Help! Help me! Hurry up! It hurts! Father, everything is burning It hurts! Vytas? I'm really sorry about what happened in the boat. I mean it. It’s like I wasn’t myself. I told Saulė that you usually throw your friends off boats less often. No big deal. The important thing is that you're yourself now. You know, Vytas... Vytas? Vytas? Fuck, there's no pulse! There's no pulse! Fuck! Saulė, do something, please! Just do something! Help me! I think you should've felt most like yourself with those wooden sculptures. - Fuck, Saulė, help me. - I'm going to tell everyone everything! How you closed the door on Modestas. How you lied to Vytas about me getting caught. He told me. I wanted to help him. And when he was cutting Rimas’s head off? Did you want to help then too? When you threw the only person who cares about you off the boat? And I'm not talking about Brigita... even though I saw how you threw her off too. Did you feel OK next to her charred body? Of course you don't want to talk now. You don't have to. - We just want you to know... - We're not mad at you. Really, we're not mad at you. Now you need to calm down. Relax. Marius! Be careful! Are you crazy? I'm so glad you're OK. I don't remember anything. All I remember is that you were the one to stand up against the killer. So that the others could escape. And my nails smell like shit for some reason. Let's go, let's go. Hold on, hold on. Easy, easy. Give him some space. First of all, one at a time. Second - the kid will only answer the questions that he wants to. Probably the most important question. We know how much you've been through. You've suffered such loss and horror. Where does one find strength in a situation like this?
