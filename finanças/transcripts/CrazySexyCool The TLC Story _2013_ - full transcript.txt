HER MOTHER'’S IN THERE WITH HER, AND SHE'’LL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SEE YOU IN A FEW HOURS AFTER WE GET HER THROUGH THIS CRISIS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN CRISIS? YEAH, I MEAN, SHE WAS ALL OVER THE STAGE. NO, SICKLE-CELL CRISIS. IT'’S A FEATURE OF HER SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA. IT CREATES INTENSE PAIN, AND IT COULD LEAD TO ORGAN FAILURE. ORGAN FAILURE? ARE YOU SERIOUS?

SINGER TIONNE WATKINS, BETTER KNOWN AS T-BOZ OF THE CHART TOPPING GROUP TLC, HAS ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAS SICKLE-CELL ANEMIA, A PAINFUL INHERITED BLOOD DISEASE THAT PRIMARY AFFLICTS PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT. SICKLE CELL VICTIMS FACE A DIMINISHED LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND WHILE DRUGS AND BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS CAN HELP ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS, THE ONLY POTENTIAL CURE THUS FAR IS A COSTLY BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT, WHICH HASN'’T BEEN TRIED IN PATIENTS OVER 13 YEARS OLD AND HAS PROVEN FATAL TO SOME.

TLC IS ON THE SHOW, WHICH IS AWESOME. HAPPY TO HAVE '’EM HERE. ALL THREE OF '’EM. WHEREAS MOST SHOWS JUST BOOK ONE OR TWO, WE GOT ALL THREE OF EM HERE TODAY. [cheers and applause] WHERE'’S LISA? PROBABLY STILL IN HER ROOM. GETTING'’ LAST MINUTE MAKE UP TIPS FROM LARRY. LISA, WHERE ARE YOU? WELL, GET DOWN HERE! WE GOT TO BE DOWN AT TRL IN 15 MINUTES. WHAT? SHE WANTS TO HAVE A MEETING. NOW? SHE WANTS TO HAVE A MEETING RIGHT NOW? HELL, NO, I AIN'’T WITH THIS [...]. I'’M GOING TO TALK TO MISS THANG. HOLD ON. I SWEAR I'’LL FIGHT HER. NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT FIGHTING. ARE YOU COMING? Y'’ALL GO. I MIGHT DO SOMETHING I'’LL REGRET. LET'’S GO. COME ON, NOW! YO, WE GOT AN ALBUM AND A TOUR TO RUN. ARE YOU SERIOUS? WE GOT FIVE MINUTES TO GET TO TRL. SERIOUSLY, LISA, WHATEVER ISSUES YOU ARE HAVING, NOW IS NOT THE TIME. HEY, SHE GOT GENUINE BEEF WITH Y'’ALL. THAT'’S RIGHT. I DON'’T GOT TO LISTEN TO YOU. MASTER P GOT THE MONEY. YOU KNOW THERE'’S PEOPLE IN THIS INDUSTRY WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORT ME? AND [...] WON'’T LET ME DO WHAT I WANT TO DO. WAIT, WHO YOU CALLIN'’ A [...]? YOU CALLING ME A [...]? I GOT YOUR [...]. SEE, I TOLD YOU THEY WEREN'’T DOWN FOR YOU. - YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SHUT THE [...] UP, LARRY, HUH? WHY DON'’T YOU GO CALL YOUR WIFE? YEAH, SHE PROBABLY WONDERING WHERE THE [...] YOU AT. YOU MARRIED? EVERYBODY KNOWS HE MARRIED. IF YOU WOULD HAVE TALKED TO YOUR SISTERS MAYBE YOU WOULD'’VE KNOWN THAT. - ALL RIGHT, LOOK, EVERYONE NEEDS TO COOL DOWN AND PUT ALL OF THIS INTO CONTEXT. NO MATTER WHAT ISSUES ANYONE IS HAVING, YOU ALL HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THIS GROUP. ALL THIS MONEY THAT YOU'’VE BEEN SPENDING AND LIVING OFF OF IS AN ADVANCE ON FANMAIL AND THE SUBSEQUENT TOUR. IF YOU DO NOT TOUR, NOT ONLY WILL YOU NOT HAVE ANY MORE MONEY, BUT YOU'’LL ALSO HAVE TO PAY BACK THE MONEY YOU'’VE SPENT, AND SO WILL TIONNE AND CHILLI. YOU WILL BE DEPRIVING THEM OF THEIR ABILITY TO HONOR THIS $50 MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT. THIS MASTER P, WHO WANTS TO PRODUCE YOUR NEXT ALBUM, CAN HE OFFER YOU ANYTHING IN THAT REALM? YOU HAVE WORKED SO HARD, ALL OF YOU. YOU'’VE HAVE HAD ALL THE SUCCESS IN THE WORLD, AND YOU WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE? LOOK, I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO GO DO YOUR OWN THING, I DO. BUT ON THE REAL, LISA, YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. FINE, I'’LL DO IT. - WE'’D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. [cheers and applause] THANKS A LOT, CARSON. HERE WE ARE IN OAKLAND ON THE TLC TOUR. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE LADIES ARE ROCKING THE HOUSE, THE PLACE IS PACKED, AND THEY'’VE JUST GOTTEN EIGHT GRAMMY NOMINATIONS. SO THINGS WOULD LOOK TO BE PRETTY GOOD. - [laughs] ALL RIGHT, HANG ON, HANG ON. I JUST GOT A GREAT OFFER FOR YOU TO DO 10 MORE SHOWS IN EUROPE AND JAPAN, STARTING NEXT WEEK. THAT MEANS ANOTHER HUGE ADVANCE AGAINST TICKET SALES. - YES! YES! LET'’S GO, BECAUSE I COULD KEEP TOURING. THANKS, BILL. YO, B, THAT IS HOW WE DO IT! YES. I'’M SORRY, BILL, SORRY, GIRLS. I AM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. IT'’S STARTING NEXT WEEK, AND I ALREADY MADE PLANS TO GO TO HONDURAS. I NEED TIME FOR MY SPIRITUAL HEALING, AND THEN I'’M GOING TO BE WORKING ON MY ALBUM. I ALREADY MADE THE PLANS, IT'’S NOT LIKE IT'’S SOMETHING NEW. IT'’S ANOTHER $25 MILLION WE'’RE WALKING AWAY FROM. I KNOW, BUT IT'’S NOT ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, BILL. I NEED THIS TIME FOR ME. COME ON, I DID MY PART. I TRIED, LADIES. IT'’S ALL RIGHT, B. I WAS PISSED THAT LISA HAD US TURNING DOWN 25 MILL, BUT I HAD TO GIVE HER PROPS FOR STANDING FOR WHAT SHE BELIEVED IN. SO I DO WANT TO RECORD MY THOUGHTS AND MY FEELINGS. YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PLACE WHERE I CAME TO HEAL AND BE AT ONE WITH NATURE AND THE JUNGLE, JUST LIKE I'’VE ALWAYS IMAGINED. I DON'’T EVEN FEEL LIKE THE SAME PERSON WHEN I'’M HERE. I LET EVERYTHING GO. I LET EVERYTHING DOWN. I'’M--I'’M JUST MYSELF. AND I-I GET TO DO THE THINGS THAT I WANNA DO. I GET TO BE IN TUNE WITH ME. INSTEAD OF REACTING OFF OF IMPULSE, I CAN MEDITATE AND THINK BEFORE I DO THINGS. IT'’S VERY POWERFUL, YOU KNOW? WHATEVER YOU THINK STRONGLY HERE, IT JUST SEEMS TO MANIFEST. SO A VERY POWERFUL PLACE TO BE. YOU GOT IT? GOOD JOB. [laughs] WHAT'’S UP, MAN? I PACKED HIS AFTERNOON SNACKS IN THE CARRIER AND HIS TOY CARS. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE HIM BACK BEFORE HIS NAP, OKAY? MM-MM, DALLAS. YOU KNOW WE NOT GOING THERE. HAVE A BEAUTIFUL TIME WITH YOUR SON, OKAY? IT SEEMS LIKE THINGS WERE FINALLY GETTING BETTER FOR SOME US, BUT HERE I WAS, ONCE AGAIN EXPECTING THE WORST. SHE'’S NOT ACTUALLY SICK. I DIDN'’T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE, MY DEAR, BUT YOU'’RE PREGNANT. - [laughs] OH, MY GOD. BABY. WHAT? HERE'’S THE THING. YOU'’RE ONLY NINE WEEKS ALONG. THIS IS A VERY HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY. IT'’S INCREDIBLY RISKY, NOT ONLY FOR YOU, BUT FOR THE BABY. YOU'’RE ARE AT RISK FOR ALL KINDS OF COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING, ORGAN FAILURE, TOXEMIA. - I DON'’T CARE. I'’M KEEPIN'’ THIS BABY. - I DO NOT WANT YOU, TIONNE, TO RISK YOUR LIFE. - LISTEN, I'’VE BEEN HEARING MY WHOLE LIFE WHAT I CAN'’T DO. AND I'’M TIRED. EVERYTHING'’S ALWAYS BEEN OKAY. THE FACT THAT YOU'’RE EVEN TELLING ME THAT I'’M PREGNANT, I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD EVEN HAVE KIDS. AND EVEN IF IT ALL GOES WRONG, I DON'’T WANT TO REGRET SOMETHING. NO REGRETS. I WANNA HAVE THIS BABY. I'’M GONNA HAVE THIS BABY. PLUS, GOD'’S GOT THE FINAL SAY, RIGHT? - [laughs] HI, BABY. I'’M YOUR AUNTIE. - YOU'’RE ON A JOURNEY, LISA. NOT ALWAYS EASY. NOT ALWAYS LIGHT, BUT IT'’S A JOURNEY, NEVERTHELESS. YOU'’RE MOVING ON A PATH. A PATH TO FIND FORGIVENESS WITH YOUR FATHER. I JUST KNOW THAT I'’M ON A JOURNEY, AND I DON'’T KNOW WHERE I'’M GOING NECESSARILY BUT, UH, I JUST KNOW THAT I WILL GET THERE. I HAVE THE FREE REINS TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WHAT I COULD DO WITH TLC CREATIVELY, CONCEPTUALLY, LYRICALLY, AND THAT'’S WHAT IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE THERE'’S A LOT OF THINGS THAT I JUST WANT TO GET OF MY CHEST. SUPERNOVAIS GOING TO BE MAJOR, AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE BEST WORK THAT I'’VE DONE YET. COME ON, EVERY TIME YOU GIRLS GET INTO THE STUDIO AND RECORD SOMETHING, YOU MAKE MAGIC, IT SELLS LIKE CRAZY, AND AWARDS GET THROWN AT YOU. NOW'’S THE TIME TO START PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR NEXT ALBUM. I KNOW YOU'’RE TRYING DIFFERENT CREATIVE DIRECTIONS, BUT, LISA, YOU'’RE UNDER CONTRACT, AND WE NEED TO START THIS NEXT ALBUM. PLUS, IT'’S A HUGE DEAL. $12 MILLION TO TOUR AND MORE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE PACKAGE WITH MP3. I DON'’T THINK TOURING IS A GOOD IDEA FOR ME. IT'’S JUST TOO HARD ON MY BODY RIGHT NOW. WHAT, $12 MILLION AIN'’T ENOUGH? OH, SO NOW YOU'’RE ON BOARD, EVEN THOUGH OUR [...] IS WHACK? LISA, DON'’T HOLD THIS UP. WE'’VE GOT TO GET STARTED ON THIS NEW RECORD. COME ON, LISA. NO MATTER WHAT, WE'’RE STILL TLC. I AIN'’T SAY I WOULDN'’T, JUST NOT THIS MINUTE. WELL, IF NOT THIS MINUTE, THAN WHAT MINUTE? WHAT YOU MEAN IT AIN'’T COMING OUT IN THE STATES? SOLD POORLY OVERSEAS? WHAT THAT GOT TO DO WITH ME? UH-UH, LOOK, IF Y'’ALL RELEASED IT WHEN I TOLD YOU TO, IT'’D BE DOING WHAT IT'’S SUPPOSED TO DO. OH, YEAH? WELL, I'’LL FIND ANOTHER LABEL TO WORK WITH THEN. HOW '’BOUT THAT? [glass shattering] I'’M DONE WITH THIS CLUB. [cheers and applause] AND THE BEST R&B ALBUM IS... FANMAIL. -TLC. LADIES, NOW THAT YOU'’VE WON A GRAMMY FOR FANMAIL, WHAT'’S NEXT? WE'’LL PROBABLY GET STARTED ON OUR NEXT ALBUM. YEAH. THANK YOU. OKAY, CAN YOU JUST MAKE UP YOUR MIND? YEAH, YOU'’RE HOLDIN'’ THIS WHOLE DEAL UP. LOOK, THIS AIN'’T THE TIME OR THE PLACE FOR THIS, ALL RIGHT? GET OFF MY BACK. Y'’ALL KEEP PRESSURING ME WITH THIS SAME OLD BULL[...]. ALL OF THIS [...] IS BULL[...]. LEAVE ME THE [...] ALONE. - [laughs] MAN, THAT LISA IS SOMETHING ELSE, HUH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? SHE JUST KEEPS GETTING CRAZIER AND CRAZIER. AND WHAT'’S UP WITH THIS WHOLE SUPERNOVAMESS? I MEAN, THAT BOMBED TOO. YOU NEED TO STOP TALKING. RIGHT NOW. EXCUSE ME? I SWEAR, THAT'’S OUR SISTER. YOU NEED TO SHUT UP. THAT'’S FAMILY, SO DON'’T EVEN GO THERE. JUST WALK AWAY. LISA. LISA? [sobbing] YOU OKAY? LISA, YOU GONNA BE OKAY. THEY WOULDN'’T PUT IT OUT WHEN DOCTOR SEBI SAID. IT'’S A NUMEROLOGY THING. IF THE NUMBERS ARE NOT LINED UP, THEN IT WON'’T BE RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSE. YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH? WE GONNA GET BACK INTO THE STUDIO, REGROUP, AND DO THIS DEAL. AND YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE JUNGLE FIRST. WITH ALL THE ANIMALS. AND MAKE YOUR OWN RECORD AGAIN. AND THE NUMBERS ALL LINED UP JUST RIGHT. AND ALL THAT WHAT SHE SAID. [laughter] YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU OVER HERE MAKIN'’ EVERYBODY A HUGGER. YOU EVEN MAKING MISS LISA LEFT-EYE LOPES A DANG SOFTY. AND YOU, YOU NEED TO STICK AROUND AND BE AN AUNTIE AND MEET MY BABY GIRL. YOU KNOW WHAT I'’M SAYIN'’? YEAH. YOU KNOW WE LOVE YOU GIRL. YEAH. I LOVE Y'’ALL TOO. IT'’S AN MTB THING. FOR REAL, GIRL, IT'’S AN MTB THING. - HEY, LISA, YOU GET TO THE STUDIO? YEAH, I DID A COUPLE NEW THANGS. DALLAS PLAYED ME A NEW MIX TOO. YO, YOUR VOCALS SOUND DOPE, SIS. THANKS, LISA. YEAH, SHE HERE. I'’M TRYIN'’ TO MAKE THAT GUMBO, BUT IT DON'’T TASTE THE WAY IT DO WHEN YOU MAKE IT. AWW. YOU KNOW I'’LL TEACH YOU THE RECIPE AS SOON AS I GET BACK. PUT TIONNE ON THE PHONE. OKAY, HERE YOU GO. WHAT UP, JUNGLE GIRL? AIN'’T NOBODY GETTING ME IN NO BUSH FOR NOTHING. NOT EVEN FOR A CURE. YOU KNOW I AIN'’T STAYING OVER WHERE THEY AIN'’T GOT NO TV, NO ROOM SERVICE. COME ON, GIRL. GET YOUR SKINNY JUICE FASTIN'’ ASS BACK IN THAT STUDIO SO WE CAN FINISH THE DANG THING, ALL RIGHT? - [laughs] YEAH. YOU ALL RIGHT, LISA? YOU KNOW YOU'’LL FEEL BETTER ONCE YOU GET DOWN THERE, OKAY? WE GOOD, THOUGH, RIGHT? YEAH, WE GOOD. I LOVE YOU, T. OKAY, I'’M JUST SAYIN'’, YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU TOO. BYE, LISA, LOVE YOU GIRL. BYE, GIRL. EVERYTHING OKAY? YEAH, I GUESS SO. WHEN I WAS A KID, I ALWAYS WISHED FOR THIS. I MEAN, PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME WHAT I WANTED TO BE WHEN I GREW UP, AND I WOULD TELL THEM IN THE JUNGLE, FREE, AND WITH THE ANIMALS. SO HERE I AM. I'’M IN THE JUNGLE. I'’M FREE. [telephone ringing] - HELLO? BILL, WHAT TIME IS IT? WHAT? WHAT? [sobbing] - [gasping] IT IS A VERY SAD DAY. NOT ONLY IN THE MUSIC WORLD, BUT ELSEWHERE, BECAUSE WE'’VE LOST ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST, MOST FLAMBOYANT AND OUTSPOKEN WOMEN OF THE PAST TEN YEARS. LISA LEFT-EYE LOPES, THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT THE RAP AND THE ATTITUDE TO TLC FOR MORE THAN A DECADE OF MULTI-PLATINUM SUCCESS LOST HER LIFE IN A CAR ACCIDENT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN NATION OF HONDURAS, WHERE SHE HAD BEEN VACATIONING AND VOLUNTEERING AT A HERBAL HEALING CENTER. - IT'’S OKAY. THIS WAS THE WORST LOW IMAGINABLE. NOW WE NEEDED TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHO WE WERE WITHOUT OUR SISTER LISA. WE'’RE BACK HERE WITH CHILLI AND T-BOZ OF ATLANTA'’S OWN TLC. LADIES, I'’M SURE IT'’S BEEN A VERY HARD COUPLE OF MONTHS. A LOVED ONE WAS LOST. I IMAGINE IT WAS LIKE LOSING A SISTER. YEAH, IT IS LIKE LOSING A SISTER. IT'’S WEIRD, '’CAUSE THE TEN YEARS WE WORKED TOGETHER, IT REALLY FELT LIKE A LIFETIME. YEAH. LOOK, I CAN'’T SAY THE FANS ARE GONNA MISS THE CRAZINESS PART OF THE CRAZY SEXY COOL CREW. SEE, THAT'’S THE THING. LISA WASN'’T CRAZY. I MEAN, SHE WAS CRAZY, DON'’T GET ME WRONG, OKAY? KEEP IT REAL. BUT SHE WAS CRAZY CREATIVE. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS CRAZY PASSIONATE. SHE WAS FEARLESS. AND SHE ALWAYS SPOKE HER MIND. OH, YEAH, SHE KEPT IT REAL NOW. SHE TOLD IT LIKE IT WAS. YEAH, I MEAN, STRAIGHT FORWARD, NO FILTER, FROM THE HEART. AND SHE HAD SUCH A BIG HEART. YOU KNOW, SHE LOVED PEOPLE THE WAY SHE WANTED TO BE LOVED. THAT'’S RIGHT. I KNOW YOUR LOVE FOR THE FANS RUNS REAL DEEP, AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE BEEN WANTING TO SPEAK TO YOU FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW. SO, LOOK, WHY DON'’T WE TAKE SOME CALLS? WE HAVE RAMONA, FROM DECATUR. WHAT'’S UP T-BOZ, CHILLI? I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT LISA WAS ALWAYS TRUE, AND SHE KNEW WHO SHE WAS. COME ON, TELL IT. ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP WE'’VE GOT JAMES FROM DECAP COUNTY. OH, OH YEAH, YO T-BOZ, CHILLI. YO, I MISS Y'’ALL, YOU KNOW WHAT I'’M SAYIN'’? WE AIN'’T GOIN'’ NOWHERE. WE'’RE RIGHT HERE. - [laughs] - YES. YOU KNOW, I JUST CAN'’T STOP THINKIN'’ ABOUT THE MUSIC Y'’ALL CREATED. IT JUST--IT WAS JUST SO DOPE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'’M SAYIN'’? IT WAS SO MOVING. I JUST HOPE YOU ALL DON'’T-- HOPE Y'’ALL DON'’T STOP, YOU KNOW? I JUST HOPE YOU DON'’T STOP. IT'’S JUST THAT MUSIC'’S GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AND, I DON'’T KNOW, YOU KNOW, TLC THING, JUST-- I HOPE IT CONTINUES ON. - IT WILL. IT WILL. ALWAYS. WHAT! LOOK AT YOU! LOOK AT YOU. NO, LOOK AT YOU! YOU ARE SUCH THE GIRLY GIRL. GIRL, WHATEVER. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? HOW IS TRON? GOOD, MY BABY'’S GOOD. AT HIS DADDY'’S, TRYIN'’ TO BE LIKE HIS DADDY. MM. NOT LIKE THAT! DALLAS IS TEACHING HIM HOW TO PLAY THE GUITAR. HOW'’S CHASE? GIRL, GREAT. TRYING TO BE JUST LIKE HER MOTHER. - WELL, YOU LOOK GOOD. THANKS. HOW YOU FEELING? I FEEL GOOD, YOU KNOW? I HAVE MY DAYS WHEN IT TRIES TO GET ME DOWN, BUT YOU KNOW ME, I DON'’T PAY IT NO MIND. SAME OLD "T." THAT'’S WHY I LOVE YOU, GIRL. YOU NEVER LET ANYTHING STOP YOU. GIRL, I FORGOT HOW CORNY YOU CAN BE SOMETIMES! OKAY, WELL YOU BETTER GET USED TO IT NOW THAT WE'’RE BACK IN THE STUDIO AGAIN. WOW! I MISSED YOU. I MISSED YOU TOO.
