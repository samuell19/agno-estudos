So we actually exist... but we can't see it on the map. As Tinne folk... ...�ok m��k�l durumday�z. Although Tinne originally means 'absent' ger�ekten var�z. But officially we really don't exist. This is the reason why we cannot become a village. We do not have a muhtar. We do not have a school. We do not have a hospital. We do not have a health center." "By God, no one even has a population record. Only my great condition Abraham has an identity. He is not here either. Maybe you will say... ... if there is nothing, why do you exist, they are rude?

I can't stand you, I can't. I will sacrifice myself. So why did you lie to me girl? I am your brother. Hi can I be mad at you? No, esta furullah, my brother. How should I know? My mother says we don't love as a family, Merdanlar . Fırat is also the grandson of Merdan Aan. But my heart is in it too. How should I say this to my mother? That's why I was making fake pegs for myself. so that he would not give me to anyone other than the Euphrates. Is it a girl? Five fingers is not one. De ildir, de il my? Maybe Fırat is a very good boy, isn't he? Beams, de il me? If you love as much as a girl, who has been able to stand in front of your love until today? Maybe, sure, right? Oy, oy.
