When I first came here, I felt only confused with both despair from failure and hope for a new start. But hope or failure were just luxury for us.

When I first met them Da-Young was too talkative, Eun-Su's face shone, and Yoo-Jin... She was a bitch. Hi, I'm Da-Young. This is Bo-Ram and this is Eun-Su. Let's all get along. - I cannot sleep on the top bunk. - Huh? It doesn't make sense that you pick first just because you came in first. I didn't do that on purpose I just put my stuff here for sec. By the way. What's that stain? Didn't you know? What? There was a big fire 3 years ago. Didn't you know? All the kids dropped dead. Stop! Stop! Fire's burning. But doors are locked. It must've had been real hell. Can't you smell? The smell of burning flesh. I didn't know. Everyone was said to be burnt to death, but it had nothing to do with me. The most important thing for me back then was getting good grades. 06:00 Get up Shit, so loud. One, two, three, four, five, six. 06:10 Attendance in the morning Seven. Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. 06:30 Morning Exercise National bodily exercise, start! One, two, three, four five, six... Hello girls. Such a beautiful morning! 08:00 0 class Yes. I like your spirit. Where were we? 09:00 1 class Mathematics. Let's read together. 10:00 2 class, English Thinking about the meaning.

Individual acts during classes or study hours are against the rules. Stand up. You may go. Even a nature's call is a violation? I guess we'll have to go at certain hours. We may have to get whipped to do number 2. If I get constipated, I should ask the dean to spank me. Fuck, they're never home! Da-Young. What's that? It's nothing. Then why are you hiding it? When did I hide what? - You had it hidden over there. - No. Still lying? - What is that you're hiding? - Nothing. No... It's a fucking mouse. It's not a mouse. It's a hamster. Hamsters are fucking mice too. Why are you talking smack? I can't live without Happy. Happy? Do you know what kind of animals hamsters are? They kill and eat each other, even their own children and parents. That's not true. That only happens when a female hamster's pregnant and super sensitive or when they're stressed out. If you have just one and take a good care of it, there's no problem. A good care? Yeah, right. It'd be so happy to be locked up and fed only veggies. Right, but you must be happy. I'm sorry. I've had it since last year and couldn't leave it at home. Please. Let's forget about it. It doesn't do any harm to us. No harm? Then what's this rotting smell? It doesn't smell like a hamster. - OK, only on one condition. - What is it? From now on you keep my cigarettes and the lighter. If you get caught, it's all your responsibility. What? I didn't know at the moment that would be big deal. Yoo-Jin, what happened to your pants? I've cut them. Such unusual behavior is a violation of the rules. I didn't do any harm to anyone and I don't think hemming pants is that unusual. Then why did you cut them? It's too tight around my ankle when I sleep so I feel uncomfortable. If I can't get good rest. Then, it affects my study negatively. And if it affects my study, I'm going to fail again. What a bitch. I feel great. That was it. We never heard her laughter again. National bodily exercise, start! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, leg exercise. One. There's one person who just can't keep up. We'll start all over again. Yoo-Jin. Can you read the next sentence? Of course it's not easy for everybody to say no, to someone who... Horrible pronunciation. Read it again. Of course it's not easy for everybody... Again. Read slowly and think about where the stresses are. Yoo-Jin. That's not the right equation. Start from the scratch. Do it again. What the fuck are you looking at? Shit! Clean up your own mess. Clean up. Please continue with your meals. Fuck. Son of Bitch! Fucking bitch, I'm gonna kill her. Hey, What are you guys doing now? You must know, smoking is prohibited. There were other people. So you saying you didn't smoke this? They were at the kitchen and in the hallway. It was crowded. What are you talking about? Don't you know everyone's at the study hall during the study hours? Shit, I saw them in the hallway and in the kitchen. Yoo-Jin, what's wrong? - I'm serious. - Yoo-Jin. We were all at the study hall. It was that day that her life started to become a total mess. Good morning, Happy! It's almost the time for attendance. Wake up, Yoo-Jin. Shit, leave me alone I can't do this any more. Is Yoo-Jin still in bed? Yes, ma'am... Well, get ready for morning exercise. National bodily exercise, start! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven Leg exercise, one two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven You must obey the rules. Can't really concentrate because someone's sobbing. Let's begin when it gets quieter. Now, listen again carefully. Question two, Listen to conversation, think about her emotion... Fuck! Fuck! I can't put up with this shit anymore. I can't do it anymore. It's strange here. Why don't you believe me? Yoo-jin, you're supposed to be in class. Yes. Hello. Yes, of course. Some students cause trouble when they're stressed. Yes, yes... it's the adapting period. There are some girls... who take longer than others. Don't mention it. We'll take care of her. What are you talking about? Take care of me? I'm leaving now! Let me talk to her! - Let me talk to her. - No... Let go of me! - Let me go! - Yeah... I will call you later. I said I was gonna leave. What are you doing? Yoo-Jin, calm down. We need your parents' permission to let you go. There are certain procedures. So calm down and give it one more try. You must overcome your weakness. Fucking bitch. Weakness? Bullshit... Open the door. Open the damn door! Ah, open it! Everyone, it's almost time for bed. Please go into your rooms. Open it! Can't do that now. Why not? You have the keys! It's time to sleep. And being rude to your teacher is also against the rules. Against the rules? You're not getting it, are you? I'm going to leave now! Yoo-Jin, you want to be a loser again? Open it! If you can't overcome life here, you can't do anything in the world. You want to fail again? Fail? You saying I failed because I didn't get into a college? Let me go! What's wrong with Yoo-Jin? I mean it's not too bad for me. Well, there are people who can adapt and who just can't. You OK? You were sick all night. Look your bed is wet. Tomorrow we'll have practice exam. Think of it as your midterm test and do your very best. Understood? I was traveling alone back to my house. I was traveling alone back to my house. You feel bloated again? No, I got a headache. It's getting bigger and bigger. Please go. Now! I didn't know then, what made Yoo-Jin shiver in fear... Happy. What do you want to do in college? Well. I'm going to get plastic surgery on my face and get liposuction. Liposuction? Why? Because I'm fat. Look at my arms and thighs. - What are we then? - Yeah exactly. Why are you taking one more year? You were good enough to go to a nice college. That's right. Yeah... but in our family, we have to be the best in everything. So I have to go to the Seoul National University. I seriously don't know why we have to study. Another day... Happy, when are we going to be happy? When... Are we going to be happy? Get in, get in. Sun-Mi Kim. Da-Young Lee. An-Na Lee. Seung-Hee Kim. Here are your marks. Some of you did well but others did worse. Those whose grades dropped twice in a row will have an individual counseling. Come to the office after the meal. It's OK. It's not only us who didn't have appetite. Both who did well and who didn't, felt awkward and couldn't look at each other. Are you OK? I feel better now. Then clean up your mess. How are you feeling? I'm OK. It's not the first time I puked. I thought you had too much food earlier. I'm not good at taking notes... But I hope this helps. It's not that I'm going to help you unconditionally... Let's help out each other. OK? Thank you. Eun-Su lent us her notes. To us... Rivals... That's probably harder than showing your own diary. We were grateful and excited with hope, that we'll get better grades. Come quick! You haven't changed at all. Thank you so much for coming all the way here. Don't mention it. Please take her back one more time. It's really up to Yoo-Jin's willpower. We've done everything we could. She's always been uncontrollable. But she even promised to her father. She'll do well this time. According to our regulation... Please... Mom... Mom... Please. If you can't handle this place, then what will you do? Mom... Happy! Happy shouldn't get wet... Happy... Happy! Happy! Happy... Yoo-Jin was crying. I wasn't sure if she was crying, because she came back or because of her parents who didn't understand her. But anyways she looked really sad. Yoo-Jin, the uniform doesn't bother you anymore, huh? Isn't Yoo-Jin weird? Yeah, she's not herself. What's up with her hair? They must have beaten her up. I know... she seems like a different person. Happy... Yoo-Jin, what are you doing here? Teacher, I have a question. The fire incident 3 years ago... was it only a fire? But why do I see bodies torn to pieces? I was scared at first, but now I feel sorry for them, because I know exactly how they felt. Can't you see them? They're lying around here. Teacher! I'd like to go to the bathroom. Ma'am. Bo-Ram! Bo-Ram! Hurry up! Quick! Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy! It seems like Yoo-Jin knows something. What are you talking about? How would she know? She said she sees dead bodies covered with blood. Stop talking nonsense. Ma'am, there was this one other student... That was not our fault. Forget about it. Rat! What are you doing? Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy! Happy... Next. Next. I'm sorry. Are you aware of what you've done? Health is the most important thing, especially with the exam just around the corner. How could you bring in such a filthy animal? It's not filthy. Decide... When are you going to leave? I'm sorry. If I leave, my mom will kill me. Please forgive me. I want to study here. Please forgive me. I'll study harder I will do anything. Please forgive me. Ma'am! Why aren't you taking it down? Happy... It was a chaotic day. Everyone had to get shots for food poisoning. and Da-Young had to put Happy to death, in exchange for staying at the academy. Who was the kid I saw in the kitchen? And why isn't Yoo-Jin coming back? I didn't know back then. Maybe Yoo-Jin successfully escaped this time. I know... she's not coming back. Hey! What's the matter? Are you sick? No, I'm fine. - Umm... - Oh, what's this? I've had this since I was young. Whenever I felt weary, I prayed holding this rosary. It's pretty. Sorry, I have nothing else to give you. Hey! What am I then? I'm sorry... I'm the one who really has nothing to give you. What are you saying? We're friends. Friends... Let's kick ass on the practice test. Yeah, let's do it. Pray for me, OK? Of course. But I'm not a devoted Christian. I wonder if God will actually listen to my prayers. Isn't this impure then? What medicine is it? My head's killing me. You just took another one to stay awake. But now I have a headache. It's not good to consume many drugs. It's OK. The big day is almost near. I'll survive. Eun-Su! - Lucky for me. - Hey! I thought I screwed up the exam. Eun-Su, you alright? Do this. Are you OK? Eun-Su! Eun-Su! Eun-Su. Eun-su was losing her smile, and our conversation was gradually decrease. Eun-Su. What's going on? Don't you want to go to a college? How can your grade drop this much? I don't know... I don't know. With this grade, you won't be able to go to the university you want. Please put yourself together. We only have 100 days left. Mom, I got grade sheet today. I increased my grade. Don't worry, mom. Don't worry, mom. I'm doing fine I can do it for sure this time. Yes, yes. - Da-Hye Yoon. Number 35. - Yes. - Da-Young Lee, Number 7. - Yes. Good job! - Eun-Su Kang. - Yes. Number 37. - I'm sorry but... - Yes? - Can I have my notes back? - Huh? It seems like you won't need it anymore. Umm... Please don't get me wrong I have no other intention. No, thank you so much for lending it to me. Can you be quiet? My head's aching. Sorry but this is my seat. Yoo-jin! You look so tired. Take this. Sweets are good when you're tired. Sorry. I don't like sweets. Eun-Su, is there anything I can do? I will lend you my notes. I think you need to get this right. I was just not feeling well that day, that's why I goofed up the test. Do you think I need your help? - I didn't mean that... - You think I don't know? I know you guys stay up and study while I sleep. What are you talking about? Time flew by and Eun-Su became stranger and stranger. K 2 plus 1 minus sigma... K from 1 to 9... Shut up! With these marks you can't go to any university. What happened? You came here with the highest grade! I just don't get it. If your grade goes down again, we'll take necessary measures. Ma'am, when did Yoo-Jin come back? She doesn't come into the room but is always sitting at my desk. I tell her it's my seat but she doesn't budge. What are you saying? And she talks too much in the class. I can't study because of her. Please warn her. And she always wanders about during the study hours. I can't take it anymore. Oh, class is starting. What's wrong with you? My head hurts, and my body is so cold. That's not enough. I hear things and see weird stuff. My head is pounding. It's OK. It's because of stress. Take the drugs and sleep. Don't worry too much. Everyone's having a hard time. You'll soon be fine. I promise. Come on. Take them. Seriously something's weird. Are you OK? Am I OK? Do I look OK? Didn't you say you'd pray for me? I pray for you all the time. You pray for me and what's happened to me? You probably didn't pray... rather cursed me. so that you can step on top of me and beat me. No, Eun-Su. What's up? Right I thought it was strange. Since the day you gave me this I've had bad luck. Eun-Su, don't do this! Eun-Su. Had I not entered then, Eun-Su could've killed Da-Young. - Why didn't I notice then that Eun-Su was going through a tough time? Number 45, sit down. Number 45, sit down! Number 45! I'm sorry for what I've done just a while ago. Please forgive me. And lend me your notes. I have no idea what to study. Help me. Please help... What's wrong with me? I really studied hard. You said all I needed to do was to study hard. And why is it not working? Should we call an ambulance? Give her some tranquilizer. She's stressed... What are you doing? Are you trying to kill me? Don't touch me! Today is the final practice exam. Think of it as a real test and do your best. Are you alright, Eun-Su? Yes, I'm good. Eun-Su looked very strange. But it's not just her. Time went so fast. And girls got nervous because D-day was coming. The D-day we've been waiting for is only 3 days away. Let's get through this... Bring yourselves to best condition. I'm sure all your efforts will be rewarded. Please pack your stuff and get ready to leave the academy. When did you find Happy? We're going to pack our luggage today and leave tomorrow morning. Hello? Hello? Ma'am. Keys... How strange! Why isn't anybody here? What are you doing here? Happy... Where's everyone going? I'm not ready to leave yet. Ladies, welcome to Younghwa Academy. You're already losers. The year ahead of you may determine your life. Please restrain yourselves from every desire and just learn to be competitive. Do your best. If you do your best, victory will be yours. You think so? All we need to do is to do our best? There was a big fire at a college prep school Gas explosion in Yonghwa academy in Daejeon around 1 a.m. this morning. Police said a gas tank exploded and killed most of the students and teachers. The same thing happened 3 years ago at the same place. Death people: Eun-Young Kim, So-Young Ahn, Ji-Eun Lee, Sung-Kyung Go Then again the school was illegally established. Ye-Jin Ahn, Myung-Hye Woo, Young-Ah Suk, Tae-Young Lee Due to strict regulations the students had been completely shut off from the outside world. This led to heavy casualties. Ji-Jeong Park, Oh-Kyng Seo, Jae-Eun Lee, Yoon-Joo Kim The Education Board conducted special inspections Hye-Jin Ahn, Ji-Hye Yang, Eun-Su Kang, Da-Young Lee in February and July, but did not notice the institute's wrong doings. There were many suspicions But it concluded by fire accident. People said that was about an entrance examination, but they didn't care about our 1 year like hell. Soon the accident were forgotten. And another academy were built. Next news, At studio apartment in Seoul, there was serial murder incidents. I had the last job interview today. I've been trying hard to get a job but it's not easy. Everyday was like a battlefield... 8 years ago, I thought l'd be happy if I put up with one more year of studying, but my life has been painful all along. The train is coming now, please take one step back. - Bo-ram. - Bo-ram Kim! Bo-ram, how are you? How would other friends be? I sometimes wonder.
