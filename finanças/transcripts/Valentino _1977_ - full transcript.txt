We want Rudy! We want Rudy...! Personally, fellas, I'm tickled pink by this turnout. They're squeezing out of the subways like pomade out of a tube. Sure, why not? It's free, ain't it? But how long is it gonna last? He oughta taken better care of himself. A lousy appendix! He should've layed off the booze, too. The moment he goes into the ground, our grosses go with him. Right, so before they take him out of here, we gotta re-release his movies into every theatre in the country. That's why I got the lab working night and day, grinding out reprints of The Sheik. Which labs? Better not be Pathé, Jesse - I got Son of the Sheik running through there. Listen, we've all got to get together on this. Cash in on this publicity, but quick. All right, so what's the angle? We're getting outta here! We want Rudy! We want Rudy! Mr McBride! Mr McBride! Hold this, sir. Sorry to bother you, Mr McBride. There's a guy here, says he has to see you, sir. Say sweetie, you look kinda cute all alone with your posy. Make a nice picture. - How about a big smile? - Leave me alone. Hey, don't I know... I know who you are! Hey, but I'll keep it under my hat. You wouldn't want those vultures to get their hooks into you. How about it, Bianca, huh? A little exclusive about you and Rudy? Exclusive? It was splashed across every newspaper in the country. Yeah, that was over ten years ago. Then it didn't matter. He was just an immigrant bumming around New York, nothing but a gigolo. He was not a gigolo. He was a professional dancer. Pretty risky, playing around with someone like you, somebody married to a big noise in the rackets. It was perfectly innocent. We were just two lonely foreigners finding a little companionship on the dancefloor. Oh, yeah? I heard all about the private lessons. Hey, that's great. Now take a big sniff of the pansies. They're violets! Too bad. But from what I hear, pansies would've been more appropriate. Ma che bravo! Bianca, forgive me. - I forgot the time. - Very fortunate for me. That was so exciting to watch. Rudy, is this gentleman who I think he is? Oh, yes. Sorry. This is Vaslav Nijinsky. Signor Nijinsky, this is my very dear friend Bianca de Saulles. Enchantė. If you could've just seen him tripping the light fantastic with that ballet dancer, you'd have gone bananas. Talk about Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Bianca was dancing with the fairy? No, she didn't dance with the fairy. I'm talking about Valentino. Why, did they fuck? They looked as though they were crazy about one another. Valentino and the fairy? No, not Valentino and the fairy. Valentino and your wife. For Christ, do you think they go to bed together? No, I don't think they do. I think the hottest they ever get's holding hands while he gives her private lessons on my dancefloor. They don't call him Saint Rudolfo for nothing. - All right, listen, I'll be down there later. - Yeah, I'll see you later. - Hey... - Mmh? - You keep it warm for me, toots. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm keeping it warm. Good afternoon, Miss Billie. OK, fellas. Straighten up, you look like the Hunchback of Notre Dame. - What happened to you? - You sent me for a haircut, Miss Billie. Not to Alcatraz, I didn't. - Biting your nails again, Frederico? - Sorry, Miss Billie. Keep that up, and I'll put you in a straight jacket, - Ah, snow in mid-summer. - I'm getting it treated, Miss Billie. Poached or sunny side up? Who for Christ's sake are you? I'm Jimmy Grimaldi, the replacement from the agency, Miss Billie. Oh, you are, are you? Well, you'd better get some polish on your shoes, Jimmy, otherwise you'll end up shining other people's - just like your predecessor. I'll try a new cream, Miss Billie. Ain't they never heard of spit where you people come from? The only one to cut any ice out of the whole bunch of you is Saint Rudolpho here. Even though he does act as though he owned the joint. But I was giving a private lesson, Miss Billie. You give too many private lessons. Lay off the de Saulles dame. Circulate more, baby. Give some of the older broads a whirl. They tip better. And while we're at it, don't go welshing on the tips, Jimmy. It's fifty-fifty, and anybody who forgets that is fired. And for Christ's sake smile! I've seen better line-ups in the police gazette. You dance divinely. Only with you. With everyone else I have two left feet. I think you are too kind. I could dance all night with you. In your arms I can forget for a moment that I am but a slave - everyone's to command by the lift of an eyebrow. Oh, I can't bear to share you with anyone. Come to me tonight. Nothing would give me greater pleasure... ...if the health of my poor widowed mother would permit it. You dear, sweet boy. Á bientót, ma belle madonna de la cafė triste. Would Madam honour me with the next dance? Hmm! Rudy, I've been thinking about what you said. If I leave him, he'll kill me. He would never dare to touch the wife of Rudolpho Valentino. I have considered it - you must divorce him. Oh, Rudy, if only I could. I know he's cheating on me with every chorine in town, but anyone crazy enough to testify against him is going to end up as a hole in the East River. I will testify. Valentino is not afraid. That's wonderful of you, Rudy, but how would you get the dirt on him? That won't be difficult. I... No more tea time hops with dagos for you, baby. Blow, pretty boy. - The music is not quite over, Signore. - It is for you, sweetheart. Now you go straighten up your lipstick before you're one gimp guinea. - Jack... - Shut up, goddamnit! Waltzing with wops is one thing, but he's a pansy. Sir! I'm an artist, a professional dancer. You know, I say any guy who dances with another guy is a powder puff. - You got that, wop? - I didn't tell him. Ah, Billie! Someone left the stable door open. Then quit horsing around with the customers. You're fired. Get off the floor. You know, there ought to be a law stopping you lounge lizards from sneaking into this country. Here, get yourself a bowl of spaghetti. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Hey, waiter! Show me to the best table. I have just become a customer. Watch the birdie! I just waited an watched. I have known about them for some time now, Bianca, dear, but I kept it from you for fear of hurting you. We are all creatures of habit. Soon you'll be free of him. Oh, thank you. - How do you like it? Al dente? - Oh, Rudy, any way you like. Oh, it's such a relief. If you only knew what I've been through. He frightens me. Right after the divorce we must go away - somewhere I'll be safe. In California, on my farm. - There you'll be safe. - That farm's a dream. Already in one year I've saved $800, and that is no dream. Soon we'll have one just like that. And there's my diploma of agriculture to prove it. How about your mama's steamship ticket? You're saving up for that, too, remember? It won't be expensive. I owe it to her. When father died, she worked very hard to bring up the family and send me here. Wait till you meet her. We don't have to wait. I could sell me jewellery tomorrow for plenty. But that belongs to you and Joey. I wouldn't dream of it. And you won't mind taking him along? Every farmer needs a family. I'll have a head start. Be patient. - We'll soon have enough to get married. - We've got the money! Now what's stopping us? Rudy, we can't live here. It would not be honourable for me to accept money from you. But you take money from other women. What's the difference? The difference is, I love you. They buy my flattery and my time, but my love is not for sale. No, Eddie, no! - Mama... - Oh, my God! Joey! Joey! Quickly, Bianca! Get out! - Go for the front door! Block him! - I got him! - That's enough, you bastard. - Shut up, lady! Now you're gonna get what's coming to you. Keep that dame quiet! - Rudy! - Put him out, Rocky! You're not taking him from me! You beat the murder rap on the grounds you acted on maternal instinct, huh? He wanted to take my baby away from me. Yeah, er... I guess you did mean your son. Hey, you believe that story Valentino died of ulcers or appendix or something - a healthy guy like that, only 31 years old? Had everything anybody could ever want. All the women in the world at his feet. What did he have to worry about to get ulcers? You think maybe your husband's old pals rubbed him out? You know, a slug of arsenic, a bullet in the gut? You gotta admit they ran him out of New York, chased him to Hollywood. Some skeletons should be allowed to rest in their closets. - You're June Mathis, aren't you? - No. You... wait a minute! Hey, June. Cummings, remember? Johnny. Hello, Johnny. Hey, some shock, huh? Whew! Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon. Mussolini even sent a guard of honour. He hated Rudy's movies. Say, there's a story flying around that he actually died in your arms. - Is that true? - No! But if you've got the story, why do you want the truth? Oh, give me a break, June. All I need is one little quote. Coming from you, it'll mean something. After all, you did launch the guy. You make him sound like a battleship. Not that he didn't always have some kind of a fight on his hands. What would you call him - in a word? Huh! In a word. To me he was... ...a dancer. That's right, he was a gigolo. Listen, by the time he hit Hollywood, he'd climbed out of the ballroom. He was in cabaret. He was a partner to an exhibition dancer on the skids. He carried that act in more ways than one. Funny how he was dependent on some dame all... ...all his life. Is that where you discovered him, in a cabaret? I just happened to be at Baron Long's on the night of his... ...farewell performance. Ach, du lieber Himmel, so 'ne Scheiße! Now, look! You got two more shows yet. - How about easing up on that, huh? - Look! I've been in this business twenty years, I know my limit. Sister, you are the limit. - Can I have a word with you, Valenti? - Valentino. Hey! Anything... Hey, anything you gotta say to him, you can say to me. It's my act, not his. OK, then you listen to me. Now, I've got a bunch of this movie crowd coming in for the next show, - and they're a pretty bad bunch. - What'd you expect? - Los Angeles is still a cow town. - Right. Then don't try slipping these jokers the bull. You're not satisfied with our act, I take it, Mr Long? - Baron Long, if you don't mind. - Ah, excuse me. Oh, come on, she's so far over the hill, she's below sea level. I know this isn't the Coconut Grove... but I expect something for my money! I fell for your charm. Without these movie slobs, I'm just another beer joint. So, you better get Miss Tain here to tighten up her two-step, or you'll both be practising on the sidewalk. Get the drift? See you out there in twenty minutes. Sober. Wiedersehen. Charming individual. You'll forgive me, Miss Tain, but perhaps he has a point. - If you'd awakened in time for rehearsal... - Aw, stow the eager beaver stuff! Anytime you want to... That two-bit musical I found you in in Omaha, anytime you want to catch up to it OK, or New York, maybe you want to walk back into that de Saulles mess? A little hot for you still, huh? No! You're lucky to be touring the boonies after what you did, killing a man. If you're keeping those lapels polished for a comeback, forget it. They have a long memory in New York. They seem to have forgotten you... easily enough. Mr Kid Gloves. Is that what all those ladies paid you for? A real lady never pays for anything, Miss Tain. Is that right? Well, God help you, junior. If you ever have anything worth taking, some bright bitch is gonna give you the ride of your life. Hey, I'm sorry. It... it wouldn't have worked out with you and that de Saulles dame anyway. Got a pin? Pull the other one. Hey, girls. A big train in a small tunnel. Just like last night. Ooh... Die große Welt. The star of stars. Baron Long... time no see. You're looking great, Bear-on. And your brother, huh? Welcome to your favourite... your favourite place. - I bearly saw it. - Your new table, Fatty. - Mr Fatty! - Mr Fatty. Hey, put it there, Baron. Oh, Baron, I didn't know you could dance. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Hey! What have we got here? Look at the lovely Easter bonnet. I guess I'm the life of the party. Hey! Pooey! Hey, Fatty! Pooey! Oh, honey... What'll it be, Fatty? Mr Fatty? You learn fast, you Bavarian bum. Those big pots of beer for everybody. I want a Ramos Fizz. They make 'em real creamy here, OK? I guess I said beer though, didn't I? Oh... what did I say, huh? What did I say? Beer, Meanie. Mr Meanie! Ow! Hey! What have we got here, huh? A floor show or a cattle drive? Breathe deeply, ignore them. Hey, if you're out of booze, just have this bimbo sweat in a glass. You're a professional - obscure them with your chin. Somebody's not laughing. Hey, Sister! You dance like my ass chews gum! Forty-six skidoo! And that means both of you. Hey, do me a favour, huh? Get off! Madam, permit me to complete your dance card. El Chocolo. I'm sorry. - Valenti... - Don't tell me. I know. You're fired. Cor, Fatty sure is going to be mad at me. You are much better off without that elephante. - Ramos Fizz? - Yeah. - Is it nice? - Yeah. - Nice and creamy. - Yeah, I like them really creamy. That's why Fatty don't like me ordering 'em, on account he has to lose weight. Sorry about this old mess here. My maid ain't in tonight. - You mean you live here all alone? - Yeah. I'm getting a bigger spot, too. Soon as I get a raise. Two more pictures and my contract's up for renewal. - Pictures? - Yeah. I guess you're not exactly a charmed member of my fan club, huh? I'm sorry. I don't go to many movies. But I'm sure I've seen you somewhere before. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, don't worry about it. There's plenty that have. You ain't even seen the poster for my new movie? They were all over town. Well, I've just arrived from Omaha. Yeah? Well, say... You ought to try pictures yourself if you're staying for a while. You got a lot of style. I mean that as a strictly professional compliment. I haven't had much acting experience, I'm afraid. Acting, hmm? No, all you need in movies is to look sincere. Let me tell you, brother. Looking sincere in this town is a lot of hard work. There must be more to acting than that. No, silly. Nobody even hears a word you're saying. So, lots of times when I'm supposed to be saying my lines, I just mouth a lot of cuss words to try and break up the kids on the crew. Maybe you can teach me a few cuss words. Sure. I do feel kinda responsible for you. Losing your job and all. Was the erm... lady taking care of you? I'm unattached, unemployed... no strings. Oh, you'll do all right. Would you believe it? Last year I was waiting tables in Dallas. Just imagine. Well, Richard, what do you think? He looks what he is, a dancehall gigolo. Come on, Richard, what do you expect? It's a Keystone two-reeler. Now, forget the part he's playing and use your imagination. Ah! Now there's a possibility. For Wally Reid? Hey, don't laugh. He's a star - big box office. Not a... not a bit player like your man. You see, honey, Wally's the boy next door all the women love. I know the women of America, and they want to vamoose from the boy next door. Valentino's their ticket to a faraway land of romance. Now remember, our hero in the movie is from South America, not South Dakota. You give Reid sideburns and a bottle of brilliantine, and he's as Latin as, er... you know, er... as a Mexican jumping bean. More like six foot of home-grown corn. Mmh. But at least he's tried and tested. Now, we're making a million-dollar movie. How can I take a chance on an unknown like Valentine? - Valentino. - Yeah, Valentino. You like him when he danced at Baron Long's. Our picture isn't going to be one long tango. The part calls for a great Latin lover. The schmuck looks like a tailor's dummy. Well, he does have to dance with her. The only time Wally looks good is when he's holding a football. Yeah. Come on now, Richard. What do you say? Well, he wears a custard pie as well as the next man, but honey, he'd... He'd look better carrying a tray than carrying a picture. I've seen enough. No, wait a minute. OK, wait. Now, that was a mistake, but wait a minute, I want you to see him in something romantic. I want you to see him in something dramatic. Honey, I can't offer this guy to a director like Rex Ingram. He'll buy it. Don't you forget, you didn't want Rex either until I sold him to you. Bert... Bert? Can you kill this and run The Married Virgin? Married Virgin? What I hear of Valentino, it's the perfect casting. I'm sorry, June. Well, at least give him a screen test. It would be a waste of good film stock. Hey, isn't that the jerk that married that starlet - what's her name - Jean Acker? And on their wedding night she locked him out of the honeymoon suite, eh? This guy doesn't want a screen test, he wants a sex test. Oh, what about your wholesome boy next door, Wally Reid - can he get through a day without cocaine? At least Wally sniffs it, which is more than Valentino does for his wife. Oh, Richard, now come on. You gotta trust me. If the test is no good, you pay for the film stock. You got a deal. OK. Skip the rest, Bert. Send all the stuff back to the distributors. You look as if you're lost. - Miss Mathis? - That's me. Your secretary said I should come right on up. You... you are not Mr Rudolph Valentino by any chance? It's Valentino right now, but I'm thinking of changing it to Rudolph. I mean, Richard Valentine. Howdy, ma'am? Pleased to meet you. Afraid I'm a mite early, but I guess I'm just a natural get-up and go-getter. Well, I, er... I'm not sure that you're early enough, er... Richard, we were just checking through your credits. I have my credentials right here. My diploma - I graduated with first class honours. - Diploma? - Yeah, right here. Collegio Reale Agricolo... The Royal Agricultural College of Genoa? Not unlike Yale in many ways. And you want to cultivate a big crop of lettuce here in California, right? Not lettuce. Oranges. - Oranges? - Yeah, I aim to buy an orange grove. But my mother is far from well, and first I must make some money to bring her over from Italy. Well, maybe you're about to do just that. Do you know why you're here? You are writing a screenplay and are wanting me for the hero, I hope. Am I right? You know what sort of a hero? There's only one sort - the clean-cut American boy, and as you can see, I'm as Yankee as they come. Yeah, but the hero of The Four Horsemen Of The Apocalypse is a Gaucho from Argentina with a taste for the tango - and he's Latin. Count Rodolfo Alfonso Rafaello Pierre Filibert Guglielmi di Valentina D'Antonguolla at your service, Signorina. Every day is Halloween in Tinseltown. So, I said to June, of course it's a gamble. Whoever heard of a dago playing a dago? At least, I said, let's give the guy a screen test. Well, the rest is history. June? - Hello, June. - Morning, folks. Just running the tango scene, Richard, trying out some music. That sounds good. OK... I'm gonna leave you here with June. Let me know what you think, huh? Au revoir, Richard. Merci bien. Is that Valentino? Well, he certainly can dance. Yes. I like... Yes, I like very much. Very good. Oh! Beautiful, beautiful animal! Like a tiger. He moves like a tiger. What grace. What sensuality. Oh, how clever you are, dyevushka. Thank you, Nazimova. I think he's got class. This is the guy you've been looking for. He would make perfect Armand to my Camille... ...if he can act. With you, they don't have to act, darling. What a treasure. June, dyevushka. Come and meet my latest discovery. Natasha Rambova. - Hi, Natasha. - Hello. Since last night, she's my new designer. Two discoveries in one day? Mmh! What dignity! I must meet him today. Where is he? Well, at the moment they're out in the valley shooting a battle scene. If you like him, you'd better stake your claim right now because when this movie's released, there's gonna be a second gold rush. Merci, ma chėrie. Oh, what glamour, what elegance. Almost like a woman. - Maybe his wife thought so, too. - Oh, you naughty girl. Every day is Halloween in Tinseltown. Holy cow! Where is he? Where is my sweet Armand? Ooh! Hey, Nazimova, we missed it. One more time for the New York Post. And what a shame! She would've made tomorrow's front page for sure. Armand, my love. It is I, your Camille. I must be brave. No! No! No! I cannot. The pain is too great. Ah, I think I will faint. Hey, come on. Bravo! Please, please... Bravo! Wonderful! How well I remember that fateful meeting. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were loose in the land. Cut it! Cut it! Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? Get that heap out of here. What daring! What symbolism! What an awful lot of horseshit! - Andrew, my boy. - Yes, sir? - Your outrage was commendable. - Well, thank you, sir. - You like your job? - Yes, sir. Then you'd better learn to recognise the uncrowned queen of Metro. - Nazimova! - Get me a drink. Come on, let's go. Rex! Melyushka! Which one is Italian boy whose name wafts like garlic on every breath in town? Randolph something or other. - Any more, sir? - Take her to Valentino. That woman will be the death of me. Reload! Death? No, this is truly symbolic. Our meeting on this wasteland harbingers death of commerce and for you, my dear sweet boy, birth of art. You can take your art, lady, and stuff it up your ass! Natasha, translate please. He has picked up terrible accent. He said... Miss Nazimova, that's not Valentino. He's over there. Ugh! Rex is naughty boy to play joke on Nazimova. Fellow artists should only play jokes on studio bosses, not on each other. Drive on! Get us a coffee while you're in there, will you? Anyway, it's terrible cliché to show death as man. Is it? - Well, where is he? - Over there. You will forgive me, Miss Nazimova, for saying so, but I don't think Rudy's really exactly in the mood for company. - I beg your pardon? - I am sorry. It's just that, well, he's had a letter from Italy this morning. His mother just passed away. Natasha... we have found our Armand. We'll have to do something about those awful eyebrows. Ooh... Oh, that I could have sacrificed my life for him in reality as I sacrificed myself for him long ago in Camille. Do you ever plan on making a comeback, Nazimova? I am waiting for the right vehicle. A hearse yet. Did the failure of Camille set back Valentino's career? Camille was a triumph. Only money lenders equate box office receipts with artistic merit. Camille was turning point in Valentino's life. Is it right that he turned down the part of John the Baptist in your homosexual production of Salome? He was unavailable. - So, Rudy never worked with you again? - Oh, poppycock! We worked on History of Dance project. Russian ballet, Greek dancing. Big production. We even made storyboard in my own home. Isn't that so, Natasha? Only no studio would finance it. No vision. Were you the art director on that one, Natasha? Naturally! We were one big happy family. Oh, Natasha, dyevushka. Come to Nazimova. Come into my arms, my little one. Did Rudy's death come as a shock to you, Mrs Valentino? Nazimova never stops thinking about... Was he ill at the time of your separation? - We were never separated. - June! We were torn apart physically for a while by the evil forces in Hollywood. But we never lost contact on the spiritual plane. - Which ended with his death. - Not at all. Has Valentino any message for his host of worshippers? He has a message for everyone. "Dreaming when dawn's left hand was in the sky, "I heard a voice from out the heavens cry, "awake my little one and fill the cup "before life's liquor in its flask be dry." He's advocating an end to prohibition? Is that a quote from his book of poems? Sounds more like the Rubáiyát than Rudy. Under my tutelage Valentino became both a poet and a disciple of Omar Khayyám. Is Omar the spirit medium through which you contact Rudy? Meselope. Meselope? Who's Meselope? Take the bones of Meselope and cast them in the sand before me. What is Meselope? A key from the past to unlock the mysteries of the future. Meselope was a High Priest to the God Osiris in Egypt, 3,000 years ago. Sacra Madonna! What do you see? Do you see love? I see trouble. Hi, Rudy. I just saw the dailies. You're terrific. We're gonna wrap early, Rudy, because we've got a light problem. Hello, Natasha, what are you doing here? Having a picnic? Will you save those bones for my dogs? I'd really like to send your dresser home early. It's all right, George. I'll manage. - Well, just remember to fold... - ...everything away neatly. Yes, George. Well, watch out for sand snakes. And if you ever want a job as a slave girl, just give me a ring. - Yeah. - Fine. If you ever want to learn how to run a studio, just give me one. Good night, Mr Lasky. Good night. And try to save a little something for the big rape scene tomorrow, huh? - Let's go, George. - Yes, sir. "Here with a loaf of bread beneath the bough, "a flask of wine, a book of verse, "and thou beside me singing in the wilderness, "and wilderness is paradise enough." - Did you write that? - Omar Khayyám. Hey, maybe he can write our subtitles. He's sort of retired. Anyway, be kind of a mouthful to say during the big rape scene, don't you think? You couldn't by any chance be kidding me, could you? I've never been more serious. You've got to be careful now. The Four Horsemen and Camille made you a star. They were quality movies. You shouldn't be wasting your talent on this sheik stuff. - Meselope's bones? - No, my own. - Your bones told me to leave Metro. - And you doubled your salary. The next step is script approval. - What if Lasky refuses? - Kiss him goodbye. Become independent and produce your own films. Nazimova did it. Do you think any of the majors would've backed a work of art like Salome? Those shoe pedlars think "ars gratia artis" means "a great piece of ass". How is Salome? I finished my set designs last week, and now I'm teaching Nazimova the Dance Of The Seven Veils. You should be playing Salome yourself. You like it then? I would give half my kingdom for you to finish it. Well, where is it? - Where is what? - Half your kingdom. Natasha, you know I love you. Promises, promises, you're as bad as Herod. He wouldn't pay up either. I meant I will give you anything. Yes, I know what you were planning to give me. Can you blame me? Yes, but you were cheating. You can't give me half your kingdom because it already belongs to your wife. Wife? You know my marriage to Jean is no marriage at all. I know she's suing you for separate maintenance. The whole thing was a disaster. Yes, I heard about the honeymoon fiasco. They say that when it got right down to it, you couldn't even pay the bill. I was down on my luck. Yes, and when your luck changed, you walked out on her. She did the walking, not me. Then you should file a cross complaint... ...for divorce. I couldn't. Last time I got mixed up in a divorce, somebody got hurt. Besides, it's not honourable to sully a woman's reputation in the courts. A court, a tent, what's the difference? If I sue for divorce, would you accept it? - Accept what? - Half my kingdom. I never do anything halfway, darling. That's one thing you should learn about me right now... ...if I'm going to become your wife. Natasha! You make me the happiest of men. Just look at that costume! And you promised to fold it away neatly for the big rape scene tomorrow. Now, would you get dressed? You look silly lying there in nothing but a turban. Natasha... Pazhalsta! No, please! Darling, darling. Oh, Natasha, please. Dyevushka... Neat trick! You talk us into doing a storyboard for the next movie, then you sell it to the press as pornography. Oh, but I did not plan it that way. Please, believe me, dyevushka. Oh, we will still make the dance film, yes? We will still make the dance film, no! Meselope says it's time to change partners. - I'm getting married. - Oh, but you can't! Spaghetti's divorce is not final. This is bigamy. Not in Mexico it's not. And his name is Rudolph. Oh... gavno! Hmm. Let me go! Oh, get her in and shut up. Someone who hates us, that's who did it. Courva Nazimova. You're not very lucky in your choice of friends. You're not very lucky with your wedding nights, are you? - June, are you there? - Hi, George. What are you doing here? Look, I'm... I'm sorry to bother you, but it's important. It must be to tear you away from Sunday brunch. - Rudy is in big trouble. - What's the matter? Is he hurt? No, no, no, nothing like that. He's in jail. - Jail? - Yes, in jail. The cops are holding him on a bigamy charge. He and Natasha got antsy, you see, so they skipped across the border for a Mexican marriage and they got caught on the way back. Now, June, if he's convicted, it's good for one to five years, and the D.A. has set the bail at $10,000 on a Sunday, the bastard! - Have you tried Lasky? - Yes, yes, but he's not taking any calls. Then we'd better make a call on him - in person. Ah, I've got my car right outside. Hurry. Hurry, George. We don't want them to spend the night in jail. Afternoon, Mr Lasky. Er... it's very good of you to see us. Naturally it's pretty important, or we'd never dream of bothering you. What are you doing about getting Valentino out of jail? Nothing. But he's your biggest star! $10,000 is chicken feed to the studio. You made a fortune out of him. Why spend $10,000 to get him out, when we're getting a million dollar's worth of free publicity with him on the inside? How do I explain that to the stockholders? That's inhuman! Nonsense! It's strictly business. The more the press knocks the boy, the bigger the box office. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. - And thanks anyway. - You're welcome, I'm sure. He thinks more of that damned monkey than he does of Rudy. A lousy ten grand! Makes me wanna spit. Have you tried Natasha's father? He's a big shot in the cosmetics business or something, isn't he? Richard Hudnut, June, is the cosmetics business. Well, he sprang for Natasha all right, but bail for resisting arrest isn't a hell of a lot more than that guy drops in a restaurant, but Rudy he didn't want to know about. Damnit, I'd lay out the dough myself, but I'm between pictures. Well, I'm not between pictures. Call my lawyer just as soon as the bank's open tomorrow, George. Hey June, come on, you haven't got that kind of money. I've got a few buck tucked away. what do you think I spend it on? Champagne, baths and black silk formals? Just don't tell Rudy where it came from. He'd never take it. Are you sure you won't change your mind and come along? I know he'd appreciate it. Just drop me off at the studio, George. It's a shame that he won't know that you're the one pal who pulled for him in a pinch. Oh, come on. Cut the hearts and flowers, George. He's my bread and butter. Rudy! They've got you in the tank. Thank God it's you, George. I thought I would be here all night. I'm sorry, Rudy. Natasha's out for $500, but your ten grand have been too much of a stickler. What about Lasky? The studio? What can I say? I guess they're scared of public opinion. A charge of bigamy is a lot more serious than just er... biting a policeman. But I am legally divorced. Not in California you're not. In California it takes a year for a divorce to become final. That's why we got married in Mexico where they don't have that law. Well, ha ha, now you're back in California where they do. OK, Natasha, come on. You're getting out of here, but Rudy has to wait for the banks to open. Don't worry, Rudy. My stepfather will stand for bail. He owes it to you for taking me off his hands. Please, Natasha. I'd rather you didn't. Look, Rudy, I... Don't worry about it, OK? Worry? Worry about what, George? Nothing, nothing. OK, come on, Natasha, let's get out of here. Take this in remembrance of me. Wear it always. I promise you most sacredly, my darling... Yes, my love? ...I'll get that little worm Lasky for this if it takes me the rest of my life. Chin up, Rudy. Come the dawn, you'll be as free as a bird. Just keep holding your nose. Ah, here, lover boy. Another nice, strong mug of coffee. - Thanks. Much obliged. - You're welcome. I don't guess you was figuring on sleeping too much tonight anyway, huh? Not a chance. That's some broad. Too bad we couldn't have obliged with the honeymoon suite. It would've been quite an education peeping through the bars. We'd have seen how much you got there hanging between your legs. The eight wonder of the world, they say. And I'll bet the blushing bride could've showed us a trick or two. Leave her out of it. Now, that's a naughty boy. Gonna have to teach him a lesson. Like er... taking away his toilet privileges. Stronzo! Merda! Which is a shame
