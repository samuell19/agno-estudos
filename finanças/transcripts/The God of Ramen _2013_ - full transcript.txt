Kazuo Yamagishi Narration by Shosuke Tanihara Directed by Takashi Innami THE GOD OF RAMEN We're almost as high as the Northern Alps. The closest one to us is Mt. Kasa. The symbol of the Shiga Highlands. This is it! What I wanted to show you. This is the summit of Mt. Yokote. It's 2,305 meters high. Look at this! From the Northern Alps to the Five Mountains of Hokushin. All of this is my hometown, Yamanouchi. I think it was about 10 years ago. I had a friend who loved ramen. He said, "Let's go to Taishoken in East Ikebukuro." I told the owner I'm from Yamanouchi. Across the counter? He said, "What?" I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but there was a mound of char siu stuck to the bottom of the bowl. A huge heap of pork hidden beneath the soup! I had to eat all the noodles to discover it. I thought, "What is this?" I asked, "Does everyone get this?" He said, "No way. They could never finish it." Ikebukuro. The ramen shop was near the Sunshine 60 Building. The line in front of Taishoken was endless. Please let the cars pass. Please let the cars pass. What time is it? It's 2:05 pm. - Think you'd wait this long? - No way. I could have gone to Osaka by now. I've been standing here for 2 hours. The last person in line has a job to do. I thought I'd stand in line. They've sold out for the day. So everyone in line has a number? I'm the last person they're serving today. Thanks. How many have you turned away? About 50, but I'm not really counting. Here you go. This is the reward for the two hour wait. Extra large. It's huge! A double portion of noodles. Even the regular is 260 grams. Soy flavored Tokyo style ramen. Is this ramen so different? Totally different! Totally. Kazuo Yamagishi, owner of Taishoken. He was 67 at this time. The noodles first. Then the char siu. Thank you. Yamagishi was born in 1934 in Nagano Prefecture. His father was a naval officer who died in the war when he was 8. He came to Tokyo at 16 and worked as a lathe operator for a year. Then a relative suggested a career in ramen. He trained for 10 years and started his own shop. He opened Taishoken in East Ikebukuro in 1960. His wife, Fumiko, who ran the shop died at the age of 52. His younger sister Setsuko has been helping him since. The shop seats 16. The seats are never empty. We have soup and dipping ramen. Yamagishi is a success story in the world of ramen. I guess I should feel happy and fulfilled... There's a sense of reluctance to his happiness. 4:00 am. Yamagishi is the first one on the job. I have to do this first because they make the soup in the same pot. Otherwise, they won't have a pot. 6:20 am. By the time the char siu is ready the apprentices arrive and begin making the soup. Taishoken's soup is made with chicken and pork bones and pig's feet. It cooks for an hour and a half. Then they add onion, carrot, garlic and ginger and cook it some more. Finally, they add dried sardines and mackerel shavings to add a Japanese touch. Meanwhile, Yamagishi is making the noodles in the back of the shop. I feel the consistency of the stuff that rises to the top. It's nowhere near done. Then I cut it. Where? There, with that cutter. That cutter? Yamagishi has been doing this for over 40 years. I pride myself on selling the best ramen. It's nothing fancy. Just good and cheap. I want the customer to go away feeling full. That's my ramen. 7:30 am. The first customer shows up in front of Taishoken. These regulars come every day. They find things to do to help. I've never seen people line up for ramen at 8:00 am. We've got nowhere else to go. We all have our reasons. Some big shots come, too. Their wives don't want them at home. Some of us get kicked out. What's so good about Taishoken? The old man. It's practically a religion. Religion? If the old man says it's good, we believe it's good. 10:00 am. There are already 30 or so people lined up outside the shop. 11:00 am. The doors finally open. Welcome. He puts the finishing touches on the apprentices' soup. No one can fine-tune like him. He boils 20 orders of noodles at once. Yamagishi does all the cooking. The kitchen is too small for the apprentices to help. They just stand aside and watch. Be careful. Taishoken stays open for 4 hours each day. In that time, they sell over 200 bowls of ramen. Here you go. One more. I'm doing this one first. A large one next. At 3:00 pm, the day is over. Once the last customer leaves, the interior is rearranged. It becomes Yamagishi's bedroom. Why is he sleeping here? Is sleeping on a board relaxing? Thank you. Got everything? Yes, thanks. The shop is closed on Wednesdays. Yamagishi visits the hospital. Hello. Your hand, right? Further exams reveal a more serious problem. The bones have no cushion. Here's the frontal view. And the side view. It's called osteoarthritis. The cartilage in your finger has eroded away. The lack of space between the joints has caused the deformity. His knee is even worse. The cartilage is totally eroded, and the bones are touching. I think you need surgery. Taking medicines or injections may relieve the pain temporarily. But you'll need surgery in the long term. What happens if he doesn't? He won't be able to stand and work for much longer. I can't say for sure... But I would give it about a year. At best. If he doesn't have surgery or cut down on his work he won't be able to stand within a year. How does Yamagishi respond to this diagnosis? Excuse me, please. I revisited Taishoken one month later and found out that Yamagishi hadn't done anything about it. He hadn't changed his lifestyle or exercised... He just continued making ramen. Certain customers are exempt from lining up at Taishoken. This man, for instance. How long have you been coming here? There was a lapse at one point, but all in all, about 15 years. I always have lunch here. Some take out large orders on a trolley. He works at a newspaper printing company nearby and takes out ramen for lunch every other day. How long have you been doing this? We came here in 1962. So over 40 years? I guess you could say your taste buds get used to it. Used to it? It's pretty good. He was a patron long before the lines began forming. Taishoken has regulars from all walks of life. Osamu Kawauchi comes here twice a week. He commutes 2.5 hours one way from Tochigi. I want to eat Taishoken ramen for as long as I can. Kawauchi has never spoken to Yamagishi. He just eats and goes home. I'm hard of hearing so I can't hear what the owner is saying. But after I've finished my bowl I feel like he's saying, "Come again." "Take care and come again." Sharing his happiness with me. We're done. Many customers say the same thing. Finally done. Yamagishi shares his knowledge generously with his apprentices. Li Washun runs a ramen shop in Kita Senju. I worked hard to make ramen. I thought it tasted good, but no one came, so... I told him, "Something's not right." "I'm trying to eat ramen at different shops to learn." He said, "I'll teach you everything I know." That's what he said. Everything? He said it over the phone. He'd teach me everything he knew. I was shocked. I thought, "What?!" Li brought his soup over for Yamagishi to taste. Your soy sauce blend isn't right. It's not inedible. But if you're running a business and want to win over your customers, this one tastes better. You don't feel cheated? By teaching him? Not at all. If someone asks for my help I'm always happy to teach them. That's why there are no trade secrets at my shop. Li trained at Taishoken for 4 days. Why such long lines? Why wait patiently for 2 hours? When I came here, I realized... How do I put it? It's his personality. He's just unique. People flock to Taishoken to learn from Yamagishi. There's always an influx of apprentices. Kiichi Yamada came from Nagoya. He is not a ramen chef. He has his reasons. Were you a ramen chef? No, I was in the moving business. I was laid off. I thought I'd spend the rest of my life learning the art of ramen. Yamada is a total amateur. He cannot even help. Yet, Yamagishi allows him to watch in the kitchen. Not even my parents would do this for me. I'm more grateful to him than to my own parents. Today is the last day of Yamada's training. He must return to Nagoya for family reasons. Thank you so much. Take this. I can't... Just take it. I don't deserve it. I'm so grateful. Thank you. Good luck. I'm going to cry. Thank you so much. Good bye. Take care of yourself. Good luck. Come again if you need my help. I will. Thank you so much. Thank you. Take care. Thank you. Good bye. Bye. Thank you so much. Thank you. Sunday, December 2. The shop shouldn't be closed, yet there is no line outside. Today is the only Sunday that Taishoken is closed. "Closed December 2nd" His middle school reunion is held on the first Sunday in December. I never wear a necktie. Ever. We're normally open but I have some personal business. Sorry you came all this way. It's so bright. I hardly ever go outside. I'm usually inside all day. I don't go out the front. I go in and out through the back. It's nice sometimes. He's been organizing the reunion for 20 years. He's always the first to arrive each year. Hello. You're looking good. Cheers! I moved out to Tokyo. I was a struggling student. I would go to Yamagishi and say, "I'm hungry! Feed me some ramen!" When I was a student. I never paid! He's gotten so heavy. I'm worried. I want him to continue making ramen. This reunion is all his doing. So if he goes, there will be no one to take charge. He has to stay healthy. We all feel the same. What I like about coming here? It's totally informal. Why don't I go to my high school or college reunion? It's so stuffy. And so damned boring. I come here every year because of Yamagishi. We're on a first-name basis. Because of this guy here. We all work together. Nice shot! One more, please. I can't even stand. This is bad. There's stairs. I'm fine. Isn't it harder to walk like this? Hold onto the rail. It's been 2 months since the doctor said he won't be able to walk in a year. His leg was definitely worse. There is a picture on the wall of Taishoken. It's hard to tell from afar, but they're cats. The picture is covered with grease. Why don't you clean it? Not without the boss' permission. It may be on purpose. You'd think he'd want it cleaned. I thought about cleaning it once, but he may have his reasons. Yamagishi bought the picture 20 years ago for his cat-loving wife. Yamagishi and his wife Fumiko were childhood sweethearts. They were cousins as well. They got married a year before he opened the shop. They've always worked together. We were married as cousins. We've known each other since we were 3 or 4. We weren't the typical husband and wife, I guess. My sister-in-law would say, "That's enough bamboo shoots." But he always wanted to please the customer. He'd say, "That's not enough!" and pile more on. They'd butt heads sometimes. She always said, "He's strict at work but he's totally different when he's at home." Yamagishi's meals are usually store bought. It can't be helped. If someone took the initiative to cook rice and some dishes that would be good, but... Yet, he doesn't ask his apprentices to cook. Hello. He won't be able to walk in a year. He knows this, but does nothing. He hasn't even told anyone about his condition. The doctor said without surgery he won't be able to walk in a year. He won't be able to walk? Did you know? He doesn't tell me such things. He doesn't? He holds everything in and tries to resolve things on his own. Two weeks later I need your help. Can you grab my sock? Should I pull it up? Help me put in on. His leg was so swollen. It was hard like a rock. No softness at all. It didn't even feel like skin. - Really? - Yes. Yamagishi also suffers from varicose veins, which cuts the blood circulation to his legs. I'm taking painkillers, but they don't work at all. His home is right nearby but he's sleeping at his shop again. After 3 months of visiting Taishoken I noticed something. A mountain of bags hanging in the back of the shop. There appears to be a room carefully hidden behind them. But the door was shut tight, as if to conceal its existence. What was that room? Their bedroom. They used to sleep in there. I see. They used to live here. But now it's all cluttered, like a storage area. They used to eat their meals here. I see. That was long ago. Yamagishi lived here with his wife for 25 years. He doesn't talk much about his wife, Fumiko. Three noodles. Oh, hi. Why would he close up a room full of memories? What's that on the right? Is that a room? Yeah. A tiny room. We took our breaks there. What's inside? Nothing. It's not totally empty. There are some chairs. And speakers I never use. Can I see? Oh, no. It's in ruins. Left as it was? From the best days of my life. With my wife. I just left it. Now it's a rat's nest. It's pitiful. Can I see? No way. Are you kidding? It's the most painful, poignant place for me. It used to be my favorite place. Now I don't even want to talk about it. It's the most heartrending place in the world for me. I can't show it to anyone. If you insist, I'm not going to do this show. That's how strongly I feel. Really. I'm working as hard as I can. Why would I let my heart be trampled on? The second floor is the same. You can't go up there. I let it go to ruin. When he found out his wife had stomach cancer, it was too late. She had one month left to live. Yamagishi never told his wife. They just spent their time together. He lost his wife, Fumiko, when they were both 52. Everything in Taishoken, from the utensils to their places, were left exactly as they were when his wife was alive. The only thing I live for is my work. If I can stay healthy and work, I'll be happy. I'm not living in pursuit of happiness. I'm ready to die at any time. That's who I am. That's who I've become. On New Year's Eve, in addition to normal business, Taishoken makes ramen to usher in the new year. It's the busiest time of the year. On New Year's Eve, Yamagishi makes over 500 bowls of ramen. No matter how hard it is on him, he continues to make ramen. It was 9:00 pm by the time he finished. I've played harmonica since the 2nd or 3rd grade. This song is about my hometown. The little brook in the song is our little brook. That's right. "Chasing rabbits in the mountains, fishing in the river..." That's our river they're talking about. Have you been back? I used to go home at New Year's. But not so much anymore. I went back once after I got married. And maybe once or twice since then. So it's been about 20 years. Winter, 2004. It's been a while since I visited Taishoken. There was a long line, as usual. But Yamagishi wasn't there. It's 4:00 am. He's usually already busy with preparations. 'Morning, boss. Isn't it easier to just open that door? I keep this top door open. He had gained more weight. It was taking a toll on his work. He used to be able to work all day but now, he's working less and less. He can't stand for long periods, to tell you the truth. His varicose veins have gotten worse. His leg is beginning to ooze. Two years since the doctor's warning. Yamagishi could no longer make ramen. I can't breathe. Even if I do, oxygen doesn't reach my lungs. So it's tiring. As soon as I think it's better to some extent... If I lost some weight... His breathing is restricted. He doesn't sleep well at night so he's barely coherent during the day. Two days later, Yamagishi collapsed at work and was rushed to the hospital. The nurse told me that the boss is in bad shape. Today and tomorrow are critical. He's in critical condition. If he makes it, he may get better, but we don't know. It could go either way. His chest isn't moving. He needs to breathe. Meanwhile, the lines continued to form as usual. But it's chaotic inside. They can't even open on time. Without Yamagishi's direction, the apprentices don't know what to do. They'll have to rely on the regulars. Tell us if something is missing. It's a little oily. Really? Sorry. The steam can't even escape. It's so oily. 25 year old Takuya Kuriyama is the most promising apprentice. There are many ramen shops with delicious ramen. But something about Taishoken keeps you coming back for more. I don't know why. Taishoken's apprentices come to learn how to make ramen and leave after 1 - 3 months. But Kuriyama has been training for almost two years. Good work. The apprentices share an apartment one minute away. The boss is amazing. Once I forgot to add the sardines. The moment he tasted it, he said, "What about the sardines?" I told him I had forgotten. It's only a few pieces. This was after the soup was in the big pot. Not in the bowl. We emptied the bowl. He could tell even after the soup went in the pot. He is a god after all. Kuriyama remained in the kitchen. But the famous lines had disappeared. 6 months after Yamagishi collapsed, Taishoken's sales had dropped by 50%. Sales were bad today. I wonder why... Welcome. It's not consistent. It doesn't taste the same. It's not the boss' ramen. It makes a difference if he's there or not. When he's there, customers believe that it's good. The difference between the boss and his apprentices is like heaven and earth. They're shooting again. Shooting what? How empty it is. The shop had always been full. Taishoken faced its biggest crisis since opening 45 years ago. Meanwhile, shops bearing the name continued to increase. Almost 100 shops bear the name because Yamagishi doesn't charge franchise fees. Amongst the most successful is Koji Tashiro. He opened 15 shops in Chiba and Ibaraki. I don't think he expected this. For there to be so many. Tashiro trained at Taishoken for three months. He makes over 500 million yen a year. Most of his shops bear the name "Taishoken." Taishoken He bought a shop that went bankrupt and only changed the signboard. He named it... "Taishoken." How much do you sell a month? About 5 million yen last month. Manager! What were sales last month? 512 million. That's something. Does the name Taishoken help? Big time. I'm nothing without Taishoken. Shops bearing the Taishoken name use Yamagishi's recipe. The biggest difference is the quantity. Making sure the customer always leaves full is Mr. Yamagishi's style. No one else does that. Not even his apprentices. They can't do what the boss does. Especially me. I'm too cheap. I know they can't finish it, so I can't bring myself to do it. I can't serve such huge bowls of char siu ramen. I couldn't make a profit. Yamagishi was in the hospital for over 6 months. He had major knee implant surgery. This is from the front, the side and the back. It looks good. Your bones were so hard! - Did you hear me knocking away? - It was horrible. Like you were breaking my body. Your leg was so heavy. He wants to make ramen again. That's why he agreed to the surgery. My life going forward is full of hopes and dreams. And new paths opening up. What are your hopes and dreams? To do business like before. I made ramen my whole life. I want to continue a life of making ramen. Especially with my customers. That's the path I was meant to walk. Eight months after his emergency surgery, Yamagishi was released and walked to Taishoken. Hi, thanks. He's back and walking! Thanks. Business is thriving. It's cool in here. It looks so cluttered. It's been a while. It sure is tiny. I can't believe I used to work here. Kuriyama presented him with today's soup. Good. It's tasty. His first taste of soup in 8 months. I heard from Yamagishi about two months later. He was going to return to work. It's been a while. It's better that it's cramped. I noticed something right away upon entering the shop. I had it cleaned. The cat picture. They're so cute. The colors faded. I hadn't cleaned it all this time. Good memories. The cat picture covered in grease. The picture left unattended since his wife's death. He finally had an apprentice clean it after 20 years. It's like reliving a dream. I'm going to give it a try. My voice is coming back, too. I have to give orders, right? I could sense his resolve to start anew. The next day... The boss is back. Someone take a picture. The shop was filled with regulars from early in the morning. Does it taste different? It's good. Amazing. His hands work magic. Just by word of mouth, a line 2 hours long had formed outside the shop. This is more like it. There's got to be a line. Don't film me, you idiot. It seemed his passion was back. Like when he first opened shop. So was his smile. Thanks. It's so hot. I haven't done it for 9 months. It's almost nostalgic. My fingers hurt. It's pitiful. They hurt. More so since I lost weight. At the end of the day Yamagishi only stood in the kitchen for the first 20 minutes. I visited Taishoken a month later. Yamagishi was nowhere to be seen. He's not here. Is he outside? He's in his apartment. He's supposed to go to rehab. But I don't think he goes. I guess not. Another month later. It's December. Yamagishi hasn't showed up at the shop since that day. I wonder if he'll come if we call. Maybe. Maybe I'll beg him to come back. New Year's Eve. Yamagishi is still nowhere to be seen. It's been 3 months since he came back to work at the shop. What happened? It's me. Did you go to the shop? Just for a minute. I have to stop thinking that I have to be the one in the kitchen. Is that so? Yes. Definitely. To accept reality? I had to accept reality, too. After I made about 30 bowls, I knew I couldn't do it any more. The pain in my hands radiated to my shoulders. I couldn't even lift them. That was it. I had to ask Kuriyama to take over for me. I knew that was it. My time was over. But I did my best so I have no regrets. When I look back on my life, on how I lived my life, as long as I have some good memories I'm satisfied. It's not like everything will stop. If someone takes over for me the business will continue. March 20, 2007 Taishoken is closing to make way for the redevelopment of East Ikebukuro. The media rushed to cover the closing of a legendary ramen shop. Thank you. Thank you for coming. I'm going to eat the last bowl of the master's life work. Thank you. Record numbers lined up to eat his last bowl of ramen. The wait was 9 hours long. - Where did you come from? - Kyoto. I had to eat ramen from a legendary shop like this one. There's closure for the regulars as well. Can you believe the shop is closing? Sure I can. I came here every day. So I don't know where to go now that this place will be gone. The apprentices flocked to Taishoken as well. There is no Taishoken without the boss. He's amazing. There will never be another ramen shop like it. Is everyone here? Thanks for everything! Yamagishi went out in style. Thank you. Please support my apprentices. Thank you, boss! They began taking the shop down a week later. This place is going to be gone. I've been here for 46 years. Making my ramen. Even if I quit, I thought the shop would remain. But the shop will be gone too. It's kind of cathartic. I'm relieved. The cat picture was taken down, too. And the room in the back hidden by the mountain of bags... If you insist, I'm not going to do this show. That's how strongly I feel. Really. I'm working as hard as I can. Why would I let my heart be trampled on? The second floor is the same. You can't go up there. I let it go to ruin. The room that enshrined his wife's memories... Even the forbidden room upstairs. An iron. From 30 years ago. A Housewife's Life 1978 Fumiko's things were left intact, as if in a time capsule. Is this his wife? It looks so rural. This isn't Tokyo. That's his wife. An eternal smile. My wife's memories are here in my heart. So in my mind, she's 52 forever. We happened to live here for about 46 years. So when I heard that they were putting up a 52 story building here I thought, "It's my wife." As soon as I heard 52 stories, I knew she was watching over me. A 52-story building stood on the site of Taishoken. Yamagishi now lives in an apartment in the building. Yamagishi doesn't have any kids. But his apprentices bring their families over. It's lonely without kids but if I think of these young folks as my kids, I have 300? 500? Who knows? There are too many. I have many good apprentices who support me. 4 years since his retirement. Yamagishi is not in the best of health. It's really hard to walk now. I'm not afraid to die at all. I'm not fearful of it. I don't dread it. I can die at any time. I'll just lie down. It's that easy. I worked hard. How's the view? Beautiful. His apprentice paid for this apartment. The one who called himself "cheap." I eat fast, too. Faster than me. The guys from my school get together in the village. Word traveled quickly that I collapsed. Then you should go see them. I'm not going. You sure? I have lots of great memories of Shiga Highlands. Songs of my hometown and my love for it is stronger than anyone. But you don't have to go? You're so stubborn. Yamanouchi town, Nagano Prefecture. His hometown had a secret. We're almost as high as the Northern Alps. Tetsuya Kanai, Tourism & Commerce Yamanouchi Town, Nagano Prefecture The closest one to us is Mt. Kasa. The symbol of the Shiga Highlands. This is it! What I wanted to show you. This is the summit of Mt. Yokote. It's 2,305 meters high. Look at this! From the Northern Alps to the Five Mountains of Hokushin. All of this is my hometown, Yamanouchi. Yamanouchi Elementary School Year Book I was born in April. My wife in May. Kazuo means "first child." Fumiko means "second, third." They said, "you two are so close, why don't you get married?" So we did. It's been work, work, work ever since. That's how I lived my life. Really... In the end, I'll be with my wife. That's our fate. Everything comes full circle. They returned to their hometown the year they got married. It was also their honeymoon. Shiga Kogen Hotel. Yamagishi hasn't been back since his wife passed away. Because his hometown is alive and well in his heart. It's more precious than ramen.
