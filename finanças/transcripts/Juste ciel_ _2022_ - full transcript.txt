OH MY GOODNESS! Sweet Jesus. Sweet Jesus! My God! In the name of Jesus! Out of my way! Sweet Jesus! Sister Augustine! Iesus Cristus! Sister Bernadette! Forgive me. What? Trainee Gwendoline! Jesus Christ almighty! He is born, the Heavenly Child Oboes play, set bagpipes sounding Mother Superior, forgive me for disturbing you. This time, it's for real. Mother, are you there? You won't believe what I saw in the vegetable patch! Could convent rules forbid Sister Beatrice from hollering? Children! We live by the Rule of St. Benedict, which cannot be selfishly changed. Enough! If Sister Beatrice feels that her news is important enough to disturb us while we're busy, we must place the community before our mere personal desires. Excuse me. Out of my way! "He is Born, the Divine Child" is only sung at Christmas. As penitence, read the Gospel of Matthew. How lucky! Matthew is my favorite. They cut John the Baptist's head and serve it on a tray. Sister Augustine! An edelweiss, here. Hundreds of miles from its natural habitat. It's a miracle. A pure miracle. The Vatican will be agape. - Bellis perennis. - Amen. "Bellis perennis" is "daisy" in Latin. Trainee, could you lend me your smartphone? Thank you. There we go! To settle this thrilling edelweiss-daisy debate, go to the hospice and show Mr. Martin. Meanwhile... No one unearths or dries anything whatsoever. How long's the vow of silence? You don't know? That's comic. How do you know when it's over? The vow of silence? Does the veil plug your ears? Trainee Gwendoline, that's enough! Cool. Convent life will be fun. Careful. Watch out! Here we are. No. 57. Hurry up! We can't see anything! No. 55. Excuse me, but aren't there a lot of them? Yes. We can't find funding. No one cares about old people. Right. It's a what? An edelweiss. Yes, it is! Look. Then what is it? Daisy The toaster! The toaster! - I won. - No, you didn't. - Watch out! - Give it to me! "Reverence" is a word that evokes "gather," "welcome" and "communion." This intimate moment of calm, inner peace and contemplation is the entryway to prayer. This really sucks. Hush Paul tells us to be still. It's true. That toaster was mine. Winning is winning, to take back is to steal. Isn't that the Bible? - No. - No? - Sure sounds like it. - Be still! Leave behind the unrest and commotion that fill the soul with bitterness, which never gets us anywhere. How do you go about changing the Bible? Can you write to the Pope? That's enough! As penitence, you'll read the entire Old Testament! You, in my office. The Gospels are fascinating. Well? At first, I thought she was going to lay into me, but it actually went well. She was totally calm. She just said I'd never wear the veil. But other than that... What else is there? Is it pretty? I'm sure there's still a way to... I know! - What? - You'll help out at the hospice. - Me? - Sister Beatrice, you're right. A good deed will change the Mother's mind. You could do some home improvement works to make the place more livable. Yeah... I dunno, it's a pain. I mean, I don't know how to do that. We can hire people. Hire people? We have no money, Sister. We took a vow of poverty. Oh yeah? - Yes. - Then we ask for a subsidy. But it's complicated procedures. "They are" complicated procedures. I'll do it. Subsidy Request Forgive my question, Sister... - Why this? - To provoke a miracle, Sister! I just read the entire Old Testament, so a teeny Jesus won't jeopardize our project. Jesus is not in the Old Testament. Jesus is everywhere. In each one of us. Well, if Jesus ascended as fast as you... we'd celebrate Ascension at Christmas. Good day, brother. We'd like to drop off a subsidy request for a charity. On the pile. Here. We'll call you. How many requests are granted? Depends on the year. And this year? This year, everything went to that. Mountain Pass Racecourse Amateur Cycling First Prize 25,000 euros You did what? - We didn't mean harm, we thought... - I don't ask you to think. I ask you to obey the rules of St. Benedict and our Father Abbot. Did I ever authorize you to take part in a cycling race? I don't think so. Do you realize, you will ridicule not only our community, but the entire church? Heavens above! Our abbot is coming. I don't dare imagine his reaction. What kind of Mother Superior will I look like? - You know... - Silence! You. I bet you're behind this. What divine intervention made you think you could be a nun? Unless... your intent is to cause us harm. I will not let you destroy our community. No! For I see your face, Judas! I feel your presence, Satan! God's wrath will strike you! By the force of Pope Urban and the power of Pope Gregory, I send you to roast in the flames of Hell! Satan will invite you to his table and make you devour his heart! You shall eat gluten till eternity! A cycling race... I love it. I knew it. That's just what I was saying. Right? Thank you. - May I confess something? - Yes, sure. I wasn't thrilled when you became abbess. I thought you were a stuffy nun who'd obey rules to the letter. I'm relieved to discover a hint of modernity. It's fantastic, you push the Sisters' limits! Widen their horizons. Have them take part in society! I'm never short on ideas. Bam, bam, bam. I'll mention this great project tomorrow. They'll love it upstairs. And if you were to win, I bet I could convince the diocese to send a deserving member on a trip... to Rome! Yes. Salute ! As His Holiness says. - First! - Second! First Girls. The Lord has given us a challenge. Let us be worthy. Glory to the Most High. - Ready? - Yes! Go! What happened to you? How's it work? You never rode a bike? No. I fear you invoked the Most Low, Mother Superior! She left hours ago. Maybe we should look for her? Do you have her birthdate? Sorry, we lost our archives. Even a rough guess? No idea. When I came to the convent in the 80s... she was already there. Welcome - How old is she? - Oh dear. When I came right after the war, she was already here... Welcome I see. Yes, I see. I beg you dear Lord, I beg you to help us. I've been very good lately and committed no errors. Please help us. Mother! "Maintain a constant speed to keep the bicycle straight..." Knew I'd make a good nun! Oh my God. You took one champion from me. You won't take two! Ouch Here you go. RACE Three minutes better! Keep it up! Come on! Come on! Bravo! You'll beat your record! Yes! Come on, guys! Last warm-up lap! Step on the pedals, champs! We'll never make it. - We'll never beat them. - Yes we will! With me on the team, the odds are in our favor! I was a prizewinner. - You won a sports competition? - Sports, no. I won the St. Jean Pied de Port beauty pageant. I was young and hadn't found my path yet. The competition was stiff. And then... it happened, without warning. An epidemic. Unbelievable. Lightning swift. But me... I'd already had chickenpox. For want of other contestants, I present... the new Miss St. Jean Pied de Port. That was my first miracle. Of course. That's the solution. - Chickenpox? - No. Eliminate the competition. Here's what we'll do. Phase No. 1. Documentation. We photograph the pitiful state of the old folk's home. And we embroider the truth if necessary. No, not great. Make the lady hunch over. I want gloom. That's it. Put the mask on her. Perfect! Come on, ma'am. Give me some tears. You're gonna die and never see your grandkids. Think of the war. Great! Super. I want the old man to die. Sir. Look alive and heart attack! - Super heart attack. - No one move. Fabulous. Phase 2. Intelligence. What? I want to know everything about every cyclist. I want their names, their dogs' names, wives' names! I want to know if they have a mother or father or even better... grandparents who might soon be put in a nursing home. Hello! After that... we visit them one by one and we use the Catholic Church's most powerful weapon. Faith? The Crucifixion? Guilt. Hello, child. Have you heard of the Poplar Tree Nursing Home? Look at the conditions these old people live in. It's a disaster. Look! Look at this. It's revolting. Did you see? It's crazy. Poor Mireille looks like the auntie who adopted you when you were two. How sad. Convincing them to drop out of the race for our cause will be a formality. - The plan's clear? - Very, very. - Come on, girls, let's go. Are you waiting for a sign from God? Good heavens! I'm being careful. You can't see anything. Okay. You're good. Come on! You stupid or what? Come on. Watch out! Watch out! Did we kill anyone? Did we kill anyone! No. They're all in great shape. Yeah. Get out if you're a man! Asshole! I'll teach you to knock my guys down like bowling pins! Hello, Pope Francis. I'm delighted to meet you. See you soon! Well? So... We have good news. At least half of them won't take part in the race. Maybe even more. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You're wonderful! Hang on, tell me everything. How did you work this miracle? We started off well... And then... And? - We need to draw a picture. - Draw... - She said what? - Do we really need a drawing? Yes, because I'm lost. Are you sure, Mother? Sure that I wish to accept my responsibility and apologize? Yes, I'm sure. I fear we might not be welcome. That's her! We come with the Lord's peace. No one can reject that. I don't give a shit! You can shove the Lord's peace! You wiped out 2/3 of my team! You're a public threat! Go back to your convent and never come out! - Because if you do I swear... - Hey, that's enough. Calm down. What? They came voluntarily to apologize, so have the courtesy to hear them out, shit! - Hang on! It's Bible-bashers... - It's not Bible-bashers! "They are"... Bible-bashers. And they want to help old people and even me! Who are you? Me? Wanna know who I am? I'm the girl no one ever wanted. That's who I am. At the hospital, my mom changed bracelets for a prettier baby. At the orphanage, everyone got adopted but me! So when I turned 18, I enrolled, but the army said no! I was "averse to authority" or something! Then the circus. But they said "no" too. "Too normal"! How can you be "too normal"? So these women... are my last chance to belong. Okay, it's not the funkiest trip. Sorry, Mother. But they're sincere and we have a great project. So you're gonna stop playing bad guy and listen to us. Alright. Alright, miss. Don't get all worked up. I didn't know... And so... what's your "project"? Okay. Guys, we're pulling out. My decision is final. The Lord will pay you back. It's only normal. Sorry if I got carried away earlier. I didn't know about all that. Of course, I understand. She's one hell of a kid. Yes, she's really... Yep. Trainee, I can tell. You're wondering how I hold my liquor so well. You're going to love my science. A monk discovered that if you crush mandrake in your wine, you could limit its effects! But careful! If you use too much... it's a possum! - I mean, poison. - Oh wow. So it's all about precision. A teeny bit of mandrake... in a teeny bit of wine. A teeny bit... That's perfect. How do you know so much about Jesus Christ and possums? Child... The Bible saved my life. Like you read it and understood all sorts of stuff? No, no, no. The Bible literally saved my life. At the time I was... How can I explain? ... headed for trouble. I was involved in all sorts of trafficking. Then one day, a deal went sour. And there, all of a sudden... Revelation. Wow, that's dope. Gimme your glass. Cheers. C'mon. Let's liven things up. I was sitting on a rock Tears running down my face I didn't know what to do How to find the strength I looked to the sky And I saw the light I bathed my soul inside God gave me faith It burns inside me In my heart I have a force that guides my way God gave me faith Something I can't explain In my heart I have a force that guides my way God is here, in me for you He's the light that guides our way Sisters! Did you hear? Lord... is it You? If yes... knock three times. I hear your weird stuff too! No one told me those things came in black too. I want one like that. Good evening, children. I wish to speak to your abbess. Who am I to announce in the house of St. Benedict, Mother? Sister Josephine of the Redemption. Mother Josephine of the Redemption. Dear Sister Veronique. Mother Veronique of the Elevation. Congratulations. For how long? Five years. Me, seven. Of course. Always more, always better. Veronique, let me see! Look, there's Josephine. So pretty! Beautiful! O Heavens, when shall I see my handsome knight again? I have not seen him for one year and am without news. "Acclaim." A-C-C-L-A-I-M. "Account." A-C-O... We accept. Excuse me? We gladly accept your invitation to dine, Sister... Mother Veronique. To the kitchens, fast! I want something spectacular! Go on! So the other Mother is the mother of all Mother Superiors? And me? You must be hungry after such a long journey. After years of contrition, we eat like birds. Like you, I'm sure. Easter Lamb. Roast beef straight from the manger. Blood of Christ. Enjoy To what do we owe the honor, Mother? We've come to take part in the cycling race. I beg your pardon? As you might know, we have created a wonderful rehabilitation program for former inmates. Alas, we have little means. But the prize would allow us to help these poor men. Thus, we will abuse of your legendary hospitality and live under your roof... The roof of Jesus! ... until the race. Jesus fucking Christ! Please excuse us, Sisters. I believe our future ex-trainee needs a refresher course on blasphemy. Oh shit! And remind her that meals are taken in silence. Of course. Let us pray for them. Bless us Lord and bless these poor lost women... Can I be punished with the passage about Egypt? I like that one. Besides, I have the comic strip. Egypt appears 727 times in the Bible. You only know one? She'll repent later. We have a bigger problem to settle. So, she likes austerity! We'll see how long she likes austerity. We'll put them in the attic. But, Mother, that's the room where... I know. Sister Beatrice, you'll sleep with them to make sure all is well. You can share our charming legends with them. A bit of folklore is always entertaining. I think... They tied her up over there. No, there. That's it, I remember... She was in all the beds because they couldn't tie her down. The exorcist priest said he'd never seen that before. He said that he was faced with Satan himself. He barricaded himself in here. He had to act fast, before other demons penetrated this enclosed space with no way out! But he heard the footsteps of the evil spirits coming closer! Exorcizamus! Te omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica! I'm glad to see you're comfortably settled in. Bedding is equal to the host who receives. Jesus is happy to open his home to you. I just wanted to warn you... the Lauds are at 7 AM on the dot. Okay, fine. A good sleep-in will be a nice change. A bat's nest! Good night. Good night, Mother. There you are. I thought I'd tidy up a bit. I'm very pleased to see that you feel at home. I wanted to ring the bell but I was afraid I'd wake you up. You'd have woken no one. My flock has been at work since dawn. And I just wound up my daily yoga session. If I'm perfectly honest, dear Mother, you'll never catch up the weeks... months of training we have behind us. The racecourse is demanding. Very demanding. In any case, should you change your mind, your abandon would naturally remain our secret. Despite your team's obvious potential, I think we'll do just fine. Perhaps I forgot to mention, our convent is very ecologically oriented and we've only used bikes as transport for years. This has enabled us to attain a certain level. Forgive us, Father, for ringing the bells with such enthusiasm. May I ask you to make Mother Josephine see reason? Only one of us can decently win the race. I know your compassion for the weak. - We are the weakest. - Let's eat. I'll think about that afterwards. I'm dreaming of your famous chicken. I guess whatever we eat needs to be blessed. Do us the honor, Mother. Bless us Lord and bless this meal to help us participate in the race and rehabilitate our ex-inmates. Lost souls who so desperately need hope. - Amen. - Bless us Lord and bless this meal. May you lead us to victory so we can provide decent housing for the elderly so dear to you. Bless us Lord and bless this frugal meal. Let us win the race because the future is youth and not old people. Bless us Lord and bless this feast worthy of a king. Help Father Abbot choose between forgotten bygone values and individuals whose crimes are surely atrocious. Bless us Lord, not this piteous meal a hungry dog would refuse. Hear the redemption of men who have paid their debt... Thieves. Rapists! ... contrary to senile old people. - They probably assaulted children! - Racists! And animals! Enough! You'll both compete. - Not another word! - Okay. Now let's eat. Amen. Come on, Sisters. - Didn't David beat Goliath? - Yes. We might have less muscle, but we have ideas. You have great imagination, so use it. How can we increase our chances of winning? Gimme that! Think out of the box. - Let's do like real cyclists! - Meaning? Doping. Anabolic steroids didn't exist back then. So the Bible couldn't forbid them. You find super things on the Net. Hang on, they cost... Okay, I see. Forget it. Another idea? - Prayer. - Prayer... That doesn't work. Mr. Pierre gives lessons I know! What if we asked Mr. Pierre to give us lessons? Why didn't we think of that before? We'd have to suffer his presence, but it's a small price for victory. Speaking of price, how will we pay for his classes? We're not exactly rich. I know. The time has come to take out your impious belongings out of hiding. Not me. I want it! Okay. An object bought, a sin forgiven! Blessed by Jean-Paul 2 Records? Doilies? You like it? I have this. So, ladies. I hear you need a man after all? We are removed from the capitalist system, so I don't know if this will be enough. I gave up twenty-five grand for you, I'm not here to earn peanuts. Keep it, Mother. You'll need it later for the post-traumatic treatment. Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Shit! If you wanna pop your valves, you need the right fuel, my little spark plugs! Okay. This, this, this... Yes. That, that... No, no! No! Okay, let's see your legs. Let's get started. Wind One hundred! The secret to victory in cycling is... We know, but we don't have the means. - The means? - For doping and stuff. The secret to victory is the group. Cycling is a team effort. You push to the finish line while saving your energy. How do you save your energy? Take a nap? You reduce wind resistance on your bodies with slipstreaming. And what's slipstreaming? The pack... confronts the wind to exhaustion while the champ rests in the back. And then, bam! He pushes through to the front and wins! That's a group effort! - Where's my pack? - Here! Sweet Jesus! Jesus! We'll need to change strategies. So much for the group. This is downright discrimination. Excuse me. Being disqualified on the pretext of a silly fainting spell! Not so loud, he might change his mind. We're being treated like King Melchizedek. Who's "Melchi" thingamajig? There. My point exactly. No one knows. In the Old Testament he's a second fiddle. He didn't want to shine like David or Herod. So no one remembers him. Would you shine enough if I made you my assistants? Mr. Pierre... I'm sure you could do better. - "Head" assistants. - There you go. I've never been head of anything. Gwendoline! Gwendoline! Shall I? Pedal harder, my champion! Rules are rules, ladies. At St. Benedict's table, everyone eats the same. It's kinda runny, but super filling. Come on. No, that's a waste. Trainee Gwendoline, c'mon. Wake up. Wake up! - Trainee! - Hurry up! Faster! In your infinite goodness, please reward the efforts of our dear trainee. Not bad. I deserve no credit, praying comes second nature to me. Not bad, but you can do better. - Better? I don't think so. - Well, I do. Cause I believe in you. But you're riding a bike. To win, you've got to be the bike. Think bike, breathe bike, live bike, sleep bike, dream bike... - Call yourself bike! - Okay, that's good. I got the idea. Then let's carry on. He said he believed in me. No one's ever said that. Ladies. Go, Sisters! Keep faith, God will help you. Are you crazy? Here you go! C'mon, Gwendo! C'mon! Go, Gwendo! Gimme a G-W-E-N-D-O! Gwendo! We chained up your nice, new bikes. Can't be too careful. May I have the keys? Sister Beatrice is having them blessed in Lourdes to be on the safe side. Come on, hurry! To the right! Welcome to the club! Sins? Let me think... Think harder. Honestly, Father, my behavior has been exemplary lately, I must say. - In that case, I have nothing... - One last thing... Could you excuse our trainee from confession today? The race is tomorrow and it's her last day to train. She came here to find out if convent life suits her. I'll excuse her, but I want to see a perfect internship report. Yes, of course. You can count on me. Let's show those tight-asses what you got up your skirt! Go, Gwendo! Go for it! That was amazing. Jesus was behind you. Did you feel him? Of course you did! - He was there! - Bravo, champ! - Isn't that improper? - Yes, very improper. Come in. Yes, child? I came to give you my letter. To apply as a postulant. - Remember? - Already? I'm only here a month. You said there was no reason to wait. It's over today, so... Okay. Very well. What extraordinary news. Time for your report. Tell us everything, child. What did you learn here? Lots of stuff. For instance? That you can only sing Christmas songs at Christmas! I also learned that Jesus left two testaments. An old and a new but the new doesn't replace the old. I didn't quite get that. You'll explain. I learned that mandrake keeps you from getting drunk if you drink too much. Are you alright, Mother? But not too much or else it's poison. Or a possum. Something like that. Anyhow, lots of stuff. There you go. May I take a look? Have no regrets, child! You're not a nun and never will be. Come on, Sister. Don't worry. - You'll find your path. - Yeah but... I wanted to see what I looked like with a veil. This is super uncool. Not bad. Not bad at all. I like the blue better. Blue is only after one year. It's for novitiates. I'd like to try the blue, Sisters. It looks lovely on you, Sister... What is your name? Charlotte! Sister Charlotte, come see me at once! Charlotte! You'd be better off here. I won't let you! - No one steals my girls! - Come now. You can't hold me responsible for this choice. When you moved here, you should've known your girls would prefer light to darkness. Freedom to rigor. Knock off the act, Veronique. Excuse me? We both know why you're behaving like this. Oh yeah, why? Because you're jealous. - Me, jealous? - Yes. From day one, you've been jealous. - Sorry, I'm not. - You are. - No. - Yes. - Yes. - Never! Yes! It's true. I'm sick and tired of you always being best! Sick of you always winning! I'm going to win this race, you hear me? - No. - Yes! And I'll go see the Pope, not you. I'll do whatever it takes. Even steal one of your girls! Wait, my child! I'm seeing Father Abbot tonight. Looks like I'll have much to confess. They say the Vatican is beautiful in the Spring. Sister, dry your tears. We'll miss the kid. How can we continue having faith in our Mother? By continuing to believe in miracles. Not this one. Interesting. And here we go. We're feeding girls who will steal our victory tomorrow. - It's the Rule of St. Benedict. - Well, he's starting to... - Forgive me. - Bring this to them. I'll make you some dessert to cheer you up. No, thanks. I'm not hungry. I'll make some anyhow. Let's see. I need... I didn't have enough to make more. We can sacrifice ourselves. Our guests will need strength tomorrow. Your generosity touches us but we can't accept. They're right. St. Benedict's Rule is to share everything. - But you weren't hungry. - I'm not. But it looks good. Yum! Yum? Can't you see it's too small? Okay, let me. Delicious. It's good! Mother Veronique! Mother Veronique! - What? - What did you do to them? Nothing. I don't know, mine are in the same state. Once again, it's between you and I. Yeah. And we'll see who's acclaimed. With two "C's". And how many "M's"? Thank you! Thank you! That's cheating. I follow your example. I adapt. On your marks! Set! Sweet Jesus. Oh my God. Shouldn't we go support her? Oh my God! Fucking hell! Sorry, Bernadette. Be still! Leave behind the unrest and commotion that fill the soul with bitterness, which never gets us anywhere! Why are you mad at me? She's the mean one. At least she's honest. You play nice, but you're the same. Know what? You don't deserve your girls. They have hearts. I want to help them. And the old people. What do you want with me? I'll give you my tip to win. You know the windy false flat? Sister, why here? Because here, God doubles our encouragements. Look. Jesus, if you're here, say... Hello! If she doesn't win with that, I'll take the vow of silence. Good idea. Mother must be right behind her. There she is! C'mon, Mother! We're proud of you! We believe in you. We have trust in you! The windy false flat... Josephine! Josephine, wait! Wait! No, wait! Oh, no! No, no, no. Veronique! You okay? Wake up, say something. I kept... - I kept... - Kept? I lost the race... but I have kept the faith. You scared me. We're both so silly. You'd think we were still 9. Sorry, I'm sorry! What'll your ex-inmates do with the money? - You don't have a popemobile? - No. I'm not the Pope. You're not? Of course. Put like that... There she is! - What's wrong? - What's she doing? - C'mon! - Keep strong! Go baby! Bravo, Mother. It's true, I don't deserve you. Yes, you do. Any room left? Think I could try a second internship? What do the texts say? The texts? Who gives a damn! Decidedly, you are a saint. Yes, you are. - Really. - Thank you. Tell me... You think I could still go see the Pope? No. But bravo. Sorry, it's still not an edelweiss. However... it closely resembles an anthemis carpatica. It only grows in East European mountains. I'm really surprised to see it here. Miracle! Thank you. So, gentlemen, are these works coming along? Right on schedule. The old folks can go home in a week, Mother Boss. Boss Mother. "Mother Boss" will do just fine. Mail for you, Mother. From the Vatican! THE END Revised and Synchronized by FAST TITLES MEDIA - I have a Renault Kangoo. - Yeah. A Kangoo. For my work, it's the perfect multi-purpose vehicle. But it's not too big, so it's easy to maneuver. I think that... if I were Pope, I'd have a Kangoo. It's more spacious inside. If you take a drive with the cardinals... - You'd be more comfortable... - Yes, I think.
