(Foreign language) (Foreign language) Mommy? Jack! Jack! Jack! Where are you! Over there is fine. Ruth? It's Paulina. Patch me through to Morgan. Paulina, how was your flight? Long. Did you get the email I sent you? Great location, lots of red tape, though. I can get us through it. I'm sure you can. But Thomas won't go for anything, unless he knows exactly what he's getting into. I'll get him the specs on every inch of this place. Try to enjoy yourself, it's a tropical island for God's sake. I'll relax when I have your office. Slow down. I might have another year left in me. Did you put in a good word for me? Every chance I get. You know, take care of yourself, and keep me posted. Okay, Morgan. See you. (Foreign language) Welcome to Resort Saipan, my name is Tony. And here are your Bojobo dolls, This, a gift from the natives of Saipan. Depending how you place them. Different wish. This is for children. Gracias, that will be all. Adios. Enjoy your stay in Saipan. Coffee? Yes. Please. Coffee. Cream, no sugar, to go. Good memory. Any sign of Dave? Yeah. He's out shooting the cargo ships coming in. Hey, did your brother get back to you this morning? Yeah. He did. Thanks for asking. I'm sure it's all going to work out. Everything will be alright. We all got to grow up sometime, right? That's Alan. Paulina. Hi. Hey, Alan, this is my associate, Tyler. He's my architectural consultant. Tyler! Great to meet you. Well, I'll go, find Dave. So How are.. You want some coffee? Sorry. No, I'm fine. Dave! Hey. Long time no see. Paulina. Great to see you. It's good to see you. How's island life been treating you? Amazing as ever. Hey Tyler. I picked up this shirt in Tokyo. What does it say? (Foreign language) "I am America's number one pervert." Son of a bitch. The sales person said it was a very funny shirt. It is. Impressive at reading Japanese, can't be an easy language to master. My pronunciation's for shit but I can stumble through a conversation. Me, I prefer to speak dollars and cents. The language the whole world understands. You know what I mean? Shall we? Hey, what are they protesting about? Yeah, the property we are headed to, actually. Shouldn't worry. Natives never go anywhere in there. Wait 'till you see this place. It's beautiful. It's 20 acre that you got. Pepe, what the hell is this? You don't like it? All good vans taken. Plus, you always say to save money, Boss. My cousin give us good deal. Just help them with their stuff. Okay, okay. Got it. Um, it's, Yeah. It's good. Thanks. Seems odd that the locals are protesting the sale but they never go there. During World War II, some of the natives went missing, probably worked to death by the Japanese. My guess is that they want to put a memorial up. So if we obtain the land, we'll just make it part of our construction. Whoa. Somebody's been doing their homework, huh? It was sacred burial ground, before Japanese even come. From early Spanish colonies, they bring disease and bad men. A lot of our people died. But the point is. It's that the Japanese is the one who desecrated the land, but now it's just a prime real estate. Pepe is right. There's a lot of folklore dating back to the Spanish colonization. Nobody cares about the Spanish or the locals, it's the World War II aspect that the history buffs are after. There's tours given on the island already, but you guys can run your own from the new resort. I'm more interested in the folklore. If it's a burial ground, shouldn't the natives be visiting out of respect? Not normal ground. They think it is cursed place. Superstitious son of bitches. Witch doctors give Saipan bad name. We're modern people now. Like Americans and Japanese. This place sounds wonderful. It's going to make it difficult to hire local staff. You offer them a couple bucks and you watch superstition fly out the window. Money trumps fear every time. Worked on me, Boss. See? Nothing to worry about. Christ's sake, Pepe. I got a set of these in my room, but they were way nicer than this. Bojobo dolls. Local good-luck charms. Not always. The way they're tied signifies the wish. Hey, what do these mean? That we should keep out. Back inside. It's a little further up. Pepe! Now that's a view. Did I deliver or what? It's nice. But there's a lot of trees that will need clearing. Are there utilities routed out this far? Just 2 miles up the road. Really. Paulina, the beauty of this place is how untouched it is. Which makes it an expensive development. I see. Morgan has taught you well. There's a lovely cove down the way with a waterfall. Hey Dave, Alan's going to show you a waterfall. Grab whatever else you can get. Tyler and I are going to scout the beach. Meet us down there in an hour. I'm thinking two infinity pools facing this side with a V shaped structure in order to maximize balconies with this view. Or you could work with the landscape. Consider three tiers of Bungalows. Jungle, beach, over-water. Push the romance factor. Sell it as an exclusive to honeymooners and couples. Cuts down on clearing costs. And you can push the eco-friendly factor to the locals. I like it. But don't give Alan an inch if we want a good price. So how long have you known Alan? Not long. Amazing. I haven't seen this species before. Do either of you know what it is? Yeah, that's Pervertis Americans. What is that thing? Hydro-sole-atomizer. Very good for the skin. It has aromatic qualities, Yeah, forget I asked. So, you found my favorite spot! What do you think? This place has potential. Alright. But being so remote, it would complicate construction. A lot. What are you guys talking about? This place is dying to be a 5 star resort. Dave has the photographer's eyes, he sees it. Speaking of which, Dave, can we get some aerial? Thought you'd never ask. This here is the X8-M drone. State of the art and ready to fly. We'll have footage of this entire property in under an hour. Don't touch it! Wait, Dave, can you go over the last section again? Got it. Zoom in. I thought you said no one comes here. Well, whoever it is, they're trespassing. No, they look like they are headed somewhere specific. Probably to the bunker. Bunker? It's just an old machine gun nest, it's nothing. We'll need to see it. They're Latte stones. It's thought they were pillars that the Chamarro built their houses on. That's what white man thinks. These mark way to sulares, sacred ground. Really? (Foreign language) Very strong spirits, place the Latte Stones. When trespassers come without permission, they become very angry. Best not to touch. He's screwing with you. Listen you can keep these up for cultural value or level the whole place. I've always thought it would make a great tennis court. Buyer's choice, of course. (Chanting) Hey this is private property. Come on, out! Pepe! On it, Boss. (Foreign language) Did he just say you have a gun? He's bluffing. Ignorant bastards. I knew you spoke Spanish but.. Chamorro uses some Spanish words. (Foreign language) Come on. What did he say? Superstitious bullshit. Like mi madre used to say. How deep do you think it goes down? Could be 10 feet. Could be a mile. What was that? It's nothing, Dave. You know there's no real reason to go down there, right? Your people could just wall up that entrance and be done. What do you think? If it runs under the property it could create a structural issue. Better take a look. Yup. One more. This will definitely need a full survey. But we're, not really equipped for cave exploration. Yeah, Tyler's got a point there, you know. Look, why don't we hire a full excavation team as soon as we're in escrow. Thomas won't sign off for an unknown property. We need to what's down here. It's your call. Paulina. Let's do it. Dave, front and center, I want all of this on video. I thought you just said it was a machine gun nest. That's what I was told, alright? Did you never bother to check? That looks solid. I sure hope so. Wow. I'm surprised the Marines didn't strip this place for souvenirs. Who's to say they even found it? This is nowhere near where the Americans invaded. Somebody didn't clean up after themselves. And looks like that somebody was real hungry. How far does this go? Now, that's what we're trying to figure out. Alright. Let's go for it. Come on. Paulina. Coming, Boss? Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's a real dead body. We can all see that, Dave. I had no idea that there was anything like this down here. Listen, Pepe, will get a full team to take care of the remains. I would hope so. Paulina. Paulina, hold on. Dave, Dave. Come on, let's go. Dave, what is it? How many dead people are down here? Paulina, I.. Oh my God. What would a woman be doing down here in war time? She could've been a prisoner, spy. But she's wearing slacks. Women in the 40s wore skirts. Maybe her dress got ruined. Does it really matter? Pepe? Thought I hear something. A ghost? A ghost? Really? Yeah. Really. You're an idiot. And you're an asshole. What the hell? Hello? Who is that? Hey. Get, out. Out! Before! Door! Let go of me! Who the hell is that? What the hell is that! You killed him. Shut up! He's still breathing. What are you trying to tell us? Let me see your footage. Let go. What are you doing! Delete the footage! Alan! You, must, die. Your fault. You all saw that, right? I mean, that was self defense, right? You saw he ran at me, attacked me! Hell, Jesus Christ! He's practically dead when we got here, I mean, look at him! How did he know your name? How the hell should I know? Maybe he locked him down here years ago. Don't be ridiculous, Dave. Who are you calling? Can you connect me to the local police department? Let go! I need that footage, Get off him! Alan, get off! Oh my god. What the hell was that? I don't know but we've got to get out of here. Tyler. Listen. Is everyone okay? I think so. I've been better. Who turned on the lights? What the hell was that? Who cares? Let's just get out of it before it happens again. Broke the damn light. You're paying for this. Shut up. Old man is gone. He wasn't even dead. The others are gone, too This isn't right. What? Come on. We should get out of here. But it's not, You got to be kidding me! Now what? Son of a bitch! It's no good, it won't budge. What do you mean? I mean it won't budge! Help! Somebody help us! Let us out! We left that open, I swear. We should never have gotten in here. Does anybody else have a signal? Dead. You two pissed off those natives and they locked us in here! We didn't do it! We don't even know these assholes! Just let us out! Dave, Dave. Calm down. Calm down. Alright? Look. It doesn't matter anymore. We just need to find another way out. Yeah. That should be right. They wouldn't just have one exit. If the enemy blew it up everyone would be trapped. What is that sound? God bless, God bless Tyler, God bless Paulina, It's me. I'm praying. I thought you said you weren't superstitious. Praying can't hurt, yeah? Well it's annoying, so knock it off! I'm sorry, Boss. Dave's right. There has to be another way out. We should check in here again. Maybe there's a back door. This has to be a different room. But it looks identical. Just like the.. This is definitely the same room. Same bed, same spot. It's not possible. Yes. Not possible. Maybe those native people are messing with us. They could've cleaned it all up while we were knocked out. That couldn't have been more than five minutes between the quake and the lights coming back on. There's no way. Are you sure? A clean-up like this would take days. It just doesn't add up. Maybe we're on a different level. What do you mean? Like, same floor plan, different level. We might be one floor down? But why go through all the trouble? Jesus, who cares! There's no another exit in this room, so let's go! He's got a point. I'm going this way. No, we should stick together. Yeah, I'm done following your lead. Pepe. Alan. We'll cover more ground this way. Pepe! Must be a way out here somewhere! I think there isn't any way out. Are you quitting on me? You come here, Taotaomo'nas are angry. Taotaomo'nas? I thought you were modern people, Pepe? Modern people don't know everything, yeah? You show me that, Boss. What did you say? Listen to me, Pepe. If you think, I'm going the wrong way, then you feel free to run back off to the others and see where that gets you. No, Boss. They are not going the right way, either. I tell you. Nobody gets out. Shut up, Pepe. Jackpot. Japanese, do you speak Japanese? I can ask where toilet is. You make that work. Come on, Pepe. Sorry, Boss. Nothing about toilet here. Tyler. I think this was lying there. It's a diary. See. He says, my sins are too many. They haunt my dreams. I will make amends with my life. Then the dreams will stop. I guess he made them stop. Guys? Hey! Hey! (Foreign language) Who the hell is that? This guy just came in and started waiving his gun around, Shut. Up. He could've shown us a way out. He found a way. Bullshit. We found a radio but everything is labeled in Japanese. Take me there. Come on. No, Boss. Nobody gets out. Here. Okay. Okay. Damn it! I got something. It's Japanese. Great. Just talk to them. (Foreign language) It's a recorded message. Just keeps repeating. What does it say? It's an imperial order. David... David. Civilians who commit suicide get equal spiritual status to soldiers who die in battle. Maybe, try another frequency. (Foreign language) Kill her, Tyler. Wait, what is it? It's, just static. Great. Isn't it, Paulina? Just great! Dave.. Dave, I gave you first crack at this property, as a favor! I had 3 other buyers out there! All ready to sign, ready to bring in their own the professional team! Just like you should've done! If they'd even found out about it before they started the construction. Maybe if you hadn't lied about it. Listen! Listen. All these arguing isn't doing anybody any good. We still need to find another way out, right? Hey, Dave. Are you okay? I'm fine. Did we reach someone? No. (Foreign language) Which way do we go? Well, I'm going this way. It's your lead. I'll take it. Hey guys, what about Pepe? He's probably hiding in some corner, so screw him. Japanese didn't carve this. Here. Definitely not. Smells awful. More Latte stones? I know what this place is. I've read about it in a book on Chamorro folklore. This was a burial site for ancient chiefs. These were the first Bojobo Dolls. And, they help the spirits of ancient chief and his bride, whose bond was eternal. That's why all the dolls come in pairs now. By separating the two a curse was formed. His bride was kept above ground, but the chief was buried down here with a Spanish commander who did terrible things to the Chamorro people during the first colonization. The Chief's suffering for his lost love would be equally eternal and that torment, would be felt by the commander, who's supposed to be still down here, and still alive. Oh my god, that's the biggest crock of shit I've ever heard. These people believed it enough to paint it on the wall. To ward off the foreigners. There's probably treasure buried down there with ancient chief. What about that crazy looking old man that attacked you? Oh, he looks Spanish to you? Well did he? What does that say? It's asking for, forgiveness. Release. Escape. David. Claire? And then it says kill me. Oh my god, Dave! Alan, take it. I saw, I saw. It's okay. Relax, relax. Dave, I think it's dislocated. Alright? It's alright, my brother did the same thing when we were kids. Sorry, pal. This is going to hurt. We should get him back to the barracks. Yeah. Dude we don't have time for this. We need to keep searching for an exit. Oh, come on, Paulina. No one is stopping you, Alan. Just uhh, don't forget to come find us if you find a way out. Fine. We'll stick together. Easy. Watch your head. I'll stay with him. You guys go on. Alan is wrong. The curse is real. You should rest. Somebody there? What is this place? We're not one floor down, are we? I saw these exact same pictures in the room before. It's the natives. Okay? It must be. Tyler, the natives are just screwing with us. Pepe? Mother of God. What have you done to yourself? I am witness now. There must always be a witness. She told me. Who told you? Mi madre. Someone must carry their pain. You listen to me, Pepe. Your mother is dead. Only one, forever. I've had enough of this shit. No, no, no, Alan! Taotaomo'nas protect me. Screw you, Pepe. It's okay. Easy, Pepe. Take it easy. It's best you heed to warnings, of your ancestors. Claire. I'm so sorry. It was an accident. You, murdered me! Dave. Dave. Stop it. She was choking me. Who? My sister. There was an accident. You don't have to tell me. You don't have to tell me. In the end, do you think we'll have to pay for our sins? I hope not. The old native dropped this outside the cave. This is the female. The male is down here somewhere. Maybe we can put the two back together. Then maybe we can get the hell out of here. It's more than just a folk tale. Because it is not possible. That's why. That order was given in 1944 when the US marines were overtaking the island. It's a tourist gimmick by history nuts. And I suppose that guy that just blew his brains out was a suicidal World War 2 re-enactor, huh? You're saying we are not on a different floor. We're in a different time. Yeah, that's the only thing that makes any sense. That's the only thing that makes sense? Do you hear yourself? Are you buying this? No! This is not an option! Okay, listen to yourself! This is insane! None of it is real! Paulina? Tyler? Stop messing around! You, must, die. Don't you forget you're the one who made us come down here. We are the only sane ones left. No, he's right. Whatever is happening to us is my fault. Paulina. Come on. You couldn't have known.. If it wasn't for me, we'd be back at the hotel having drinks talking about what an asshole Alan is, I'm the one who insisted we come down here. You're right. Alan is a huge asshole. You are completely wrong about the rest, but Alan is definitely an asshole. Dave gave me this. He said that the old native dropped it outside. It's the matching female to the male doll that's supposed to be down here. Huh. Sure looks like the one in the painting. He said if we re-unite them then we may be able to get out of here. Look, I just told everybody that I think we traveled back in time, so I'm willing to try anything right now. Come on. Maybe this will give us some clues. It's bullshit. It's bullshit. Just the natives are screwing with us. It's the natives screwing, That son of a bitch. Enough of this voodoo crap, Pepe. You come and face me like a man. Hey, I'm talking to you! Hey! Pepe! Pepe! Pepe, come back! Listen, I just want to talk! Pepe, listen. This is okay. I get it, okay. You're one of the protesters, right? That's it. You've been working with them from the start. You want to scare all the white devils away from your sacred ground. It's genius. Come on, Pepe! Show us our way out of here. Tell the police whatever you want. You hear me, Pepe? Get us out of here and all is forgiven! You want money? Just get me out of here, Pepe. I'm going to pay whatever you want. You hear me? Name your price! Pepe! (Foreign language) Her fault. I'm going to go check on Dave. Who's down there? Mommy? Yes, Sweetie, it's me. I'm cold. I'm so sorry, Jack. I should've been watching you. Where were you? I'm right here now. Mommy's right here. I missed you. Did you forget about me? Of course not. I love you. Why did you let me die? Paulina! What's the matter? My son, I saw my son. Hey. Hey. Whatever you saw. Whatever you saw, it wasn't real. Okay? I didn't know you had a son. I lost him 6 years ago. I'm so sorry. He was 6. And we were at the pier. I was with this guy I was dating, and I got distracted. I took my eyes off him for just one minute, and then he was gone. The next morning his body washed up on shore. He must have fallen in. That's why I can't be with anyone. Can you understand that? Well, well, well. What do we have here? Little inner-tunnel romance, huh? That's why you've been so standoffish, Paulina. You should've just told me. It doesn't matter. I know he's going to be one lucky guy. What did you just say? She moaned like a whore when I railed her. Don't you ever talk about her like that again. What's going on, Tyler? I will rip your God Damned throat out for saying that. Tyler! I didn't say anything. He didn't say anything. He said that you, and him. Easy. I'm, I'm sorry. You were hearing things. The same thing happened to the soldiers here. It's in the diary. Sure. The officer and his men were stationed here during World War II. The soldier named Kato started behaving irrationally. (Foreign language) The male Bojobo. Enough with the stupid dolls. Doesn't this look just like the female doll from the painting? The old native dropped it outside and Dave brought it in. Kato continues to be insubordinate. (Foreign language) They found a passage to Gehenna. The room where the curse originated. (Foreign language) The battle of Saipan had begun. What did the creature say? He just wrote it down phonetically. (Foreign language) That's Spanish. Only one can live. The Japanese were ordered to hold the island until the very end. So they did. Ah, but.. (Foreign language) I am the only sane one left. I know what I must do. What? It is done. Well, that was a lot of help, wasn't it? Listen to me. Pepe's gone off the deep end. He destroyed the radio, and he's cut himself. Which one of us is next? Well, you two can sit here and think about it. And I'm going to go do what has to be done. I'll find him. You don't think Pepe would murder us? I don't know. But the last thing soldier said was that he would make amends with his life. So, he killed himself. Look at this. Seems my life is not amends enough. How long must I live in this hell, alone? We need to find that room. David. No. No. Oh my God, Dave. Oh, this can't be happening. It was recording. Claire! Please! No! Who's Claire? His dead sister. Wait, Pepe. Pepe had a knife. And Alan was right. The generator must be dying. Come on. Come on, we have to hurry. Stay behind me. Let me see the camera. It's alright. I think someone is there. Where? Where? I can't see anything. It's a woman. Where? I don't know, Turn that off, I can't see. She, she's coming at us! I can't see anything! Turn off! No. No. No! Hey! Hey! Look at me! Look at me. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. There's nothing here. See? Alright? I saw her. It's okay. Okay. We're getting out of here, together. Oh god. That's it. Great. Mommy! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Did you see him again? Hey. Hey. Like you said, none of this is real. Okay? Let me. Smells even worse down here. Oh, thank god, I found you. Alan. Dave's dead. We think it was Pepe. No. That would be me. Tyler! Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Wake up. Come on. Talk to me. Wake up! Why? Why? You think I'm going to wait 'til this place makes you all crazy and you chop me up? No, no, no, Paulina. I'm going to strike first. Come here! Come back! Paulina! Where are you going! You can't run from me! You're dead! You' hear me? dead! The curse. (Foreign language) Only one, can live? (Foreign language) Torment to all. (Foreign language) Witness for eternity. Torment for eternity. Now you understand. Spanish men come here, to enslave our people. So, shaman enslave him. He kept him here. Alone. For over 300 years. Where did you find her? The old native dropped it outside, and Dave picked it up. He should not have done that! This can all end now. We can end the curse, and be free. That is not what my ancestors want! But it's got nothing to do with us. We weren't even born yet. You aren't born yet, even now. Time matters not in this place. We slide back, so Bojobo can be together. Yes, so they can be together. They want to be together. All can be freed. Don't you worry, Sweetheart. You'll get yours. No forgiveness! Don't! We had a chance! Just me. Stay down, Pepe! I am Gai Taotao! The spirits protect me! Only one, only one, You win, Boss. But you not understand. One witness forever. Chosen one, my ass. Just you and me, Paulina. Give it up, Paulina! I'm the one who survives. Paulina! Paulina! Come out come out wherever you are, Paulina. I got you. Take it easy, okay? I should shoot you down right now. Paulina! Don't. Don't do it. You should listen to him. Listen to him. We had a chance. We had a chance. You, bitch! Wait! Only one can live. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you, too. What are you waiting for? Get on with that! Just me and you, Tyler. How did I get in here? Tyler, I didn't. Bravo. You win. You, you still don't get it, do you? You, selfish piece of shit. If you live, you lose. You lose worst of all. After all, doesn't this all look familiar? Us here in the dark, in about 70 years? What? I'm alive. I'm alive. We win! How many dead people are down here? What would a woman be doing in war time? She could be a prisoner, spy, or, We had a chance! You win, Boss. But you not understand. Here in the dark, in about 70 years. Only one, forever. You must die. Can't be. No! What are you! Get off me! Still breathing. Only one. What are you trying to tell us? You. Must. Die. Paulina? I'm coming for you! Taxi!
