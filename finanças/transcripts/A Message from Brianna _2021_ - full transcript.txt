We get the call from the doctor tomorrow. I'm scared. Damn baby, you acting like she's going in for surgery or something. I know Kathy If killing a vibe was a person. Oh really? Gonna do me like that? It's okay, my baby walk soon enough, right Bri? Another one? Yeah. You did not have to do that. Thank you. What's in here? A teddy bear. Not a teddy bear. It's a nanny cam.

And we're all comfortable in our new home. I'm just so happy I'm done. All the paperwork, the moving, the fixing. Has me exhausted. I bet. I mean we lucked up though. Being able to buy this house so cheap from your grandfather. It was either us or the bank. At least it gets to stay in the family. And we get to pass it on to our kids. Kids? Babe, I'm not having anymore kids. At least not for a while. Bri is more than enough. Whatever. Goodnight. "Whatever goodnight"? Okay, that's what we're doing? Okay. Goodnight baby. Home sweet home. What a day what a day. All right baby, you're gonna sit here and play with your new toys while mommy cooks dinner. Yeah. Okay. Here you go, baby. You want this? Here's her brush. Here's her brush. Tell me what you want. Why you looking at me like that? I want you, girl. Leonard. Sorry, I was thirsty. The door. Why'd you leave the door open? I didn't leave that door open. You probably did. Oh I did? You definitely left the door open. Babe, I really didn't leave this door open. So you got amnesia again? Are you gonna stare at it or are you gonna close it? And you brought dirt into my kitchen? Babe, what are you talking about? Clean it up and go feed the dogs please. Anything else? Yeah, I'll let you know. All right, so who do we have next? We have little miss Brianna. Therapist said she's done well. No signs of autism or any physical defects. Her x-rays look good. So do our MRI reports. So what are you thinking? Well it's complicated. My first thought was Rhett Syndrome. What makes you think that? Well as you know, with Rhett Syndrome children between one and four years of age lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. The loss can be rapid, could be more gradual, occurring over weeks or even months. That actually seems to fit Brianna's clinical picture here. Yeah, but that's it. She hasn't experienced any pain in her lower extremities and her head growth is normal. So what are you thinking? My first thought was Acute Benign Myositis. Yeah, but usually you have leg pain associated with that as well. Yes I know, but the difference is with Rhett Syndrome you lose the ability to walk. Brianna's x-rays and MRI report show no structural damage. So what do I tell the parents? I mean I don't wanna scare them and we're not really sure what we're dealing with. I would just be truthful. There's a chance Brianna won't resume walking for a long time. They'll need to understand and accept that. All right. We'll continue to run tests. Kathy! Dr. Dickerson's on the phone! Okay babe, coming! Hello? Hey Leonard. How are you guys making out? Good good, finally getting settled in. That sounds great. You guys deserve it. Well I hope I have some good news for you. So I looked at Brianna's tests, all of her tests came back negative. Her MRis are negative, her x-rays are good. She really doesn't show any sign of developmental problems. You guys seem kinda down. No, no, not down at all. It's a great thing. I'm just a little confused because... I mean she's still not walking, so I was just hoping to maybe get some type of answer. Listen, we just gotta give it some more time. We'll continue to do the therapy, we'll run some more tests, and hopefully we'll have a breakthrough soon. Okay. Time and patience it is then. And listen, you guys have a great evening. Thank you. You too. Thank you. Baby. She's okay. I'm just... You know. I know. She's good. She's gonna be great.

And you want me to go to the porch to check on two hungry dogs. You better tuck it in then. What the hell are you guys barking at? Come on, y'all want your food? Got your food, but you wanna bark. Keep barking. All right come on, that should be good enough. Come on. Back in there, come on. Come on come on. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, come on. Now stop barking and eat. Okay? So? What? What was it? Duh. Oh nothing, I guess they were just hungry. Barking like that? I don't know babe, it was kinda weird. When I was walking back up the back door opened. Shut up, stupid. You need to stop trying to scare me. I'm being serious. Goodnight. Why you holding me so tight? I thought you weren't scared.

Why are you in the bed so early? Waiting for you, my sexy housewife. Now we can record it. When you don't wanna give me some I can just watch it. What? No you did not. You are so silly. Look babe, I'm all ready to go. Uh-uh. I'm not doing this with you. Crazy. My sexy ass husband. I just started my period. Aw babe, for real? I know- - You said tonight. I've been looking forward to this all day. What do you want me to do? It just popped out of no where. Sue me. Oh okay, Mr. Attitude. I love you. Is my hubby mad at me? Are you mad 'cause you can't get any and you gotta wait? Wake up! Wake up! What's wrong babe? When you got up last night you must've taken her out of her crib. Huh? What are you talking about? Why would I do that? Are you hurt? Are you okay baby? Let me see. Let mommy look at you. Are you hurt? She was in our bed? No, she was laying on the floor next to her crib. Really? Yes. Are you messing with me? How did she get out of her crib? Probably got out her crib the same way you left the refrigerator open. I mean I know I got up and I went to the kitchen, but I just don't remember picking her up. But maybe I did. Yeah, you don't remember. Just like you don't remember leaving the refrigerator open! Okay, okay, okay. I just can't believe I did that. Me either. Come here, Bri. Daddy's sorry, pumpkin. Can you just go feed the dogs? What the fuck? Did you just shit in your food? Both of y'all? Really? Come on. Come on come on come on come on come on come on come on come on. Really? Can't believe y'all just did this shit. Stop digging in the grass, Titus! Titus! Titus stop digging in the grass, buddy! Titus! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Titus. How was your shower, my sexy man? Good. I needed it. What's up? Something wrong? Those dogs still aren't eating. We need to just let them out of those kennels. If they poop on the rug oh well. What? I mean you know my dog always eats. She greedy. Not today she isn't. Hasn't touched her food all day. This morning I was really pissed. What she do? Shit right in the food bowl. Right on top of the food. What? Why? Who knows. Maybe it's the food. New house. I don't know. Ew. That's weird. Maybe they're sick. Who knows. It's something. Dang babe, what? That was the weirdest thing. Our daughter. She was staring at me wide awake. Babe, are you sure you just didn't dream that? No, it wasn't a dream. I know what I saw. Her eyes were wide open. Okay, well she's asleep and that's what I wanna be doing. Can we please just go back to sleep babe? Leonard! Come here come here come here. Come here baby. What the hell was that? I don't know, but I'm about to find out. Oh my god. Wait, you cannot leave us in here! Just wait a minute. Let me see what the hell is going on. I'm gonna call the police. What's wrong buddy? Hmm? What's wrong? What's wrong? Fufu. Are you not gonna get the door? Hi sir, Sheriff Lee Boyd. Yeah, I heard about your situation and wonder if I can please ask you a few questions. We're trying to investigate what happened. Okay. All right. So tell me, Leonard is it? Is that the correct name? Yes, Leonard. Okey-doke. Sorry, I'm bad with names. So explain to me what happened. Me and my wife were sleeping. All of a sudden we heard a loud bang like a door slam. Did a door slam, or did just sound like a door slammed? I think a door slammed. I don't know exactly, but that's what it sounded like. Kathy, please babe, sit. Have a seat. It's all clear out back. No signs of a break in. Perfect. Okay, no sign of a break in. Continue. We jump up. My wife grabbed the baby. And that's when I went to the porch. And I found my dog all bloody. And that's you realized that the other dog had been eaten alive? Oops. Yes sheriff, thanks. Well, I'm sorry to tell you, but we have to call Animal Control. So what you're saying is you guys are gonna kill my dog? No no no I'm not saying that. Yes! Yes! That's exactly what he's saying. Your dog killed my Fufu and we have a daughter! And she's not safe in the house with that goddamn dog! So here's what's gonna happen. The dog will not necessarily be put down. But he will definitely be quarantined. Quarantined? Do you know what rabies are? What the fuck is a quarantine going to do? Get your dog out of here now! Kathy I got it! I hear you! Do you have it? They will come around and pick up the dog within 12 hours. That's all right. I'll take him when I go into work. Do you want to take him? No! You take your fucking dog now! Grab your clothes. Grab my clothes? Peek-a-boo! Grab my clothes. Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Use your pillow. Peek-a-boo! You gonna play with me? Yeah. You ready? Peek-a-boo! - Peek-a-boo! - Peek-a-boo! - Peek-a-boo! - Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! No! Mommy. Open the door, mommy. Mommy. Get the fuck away from me! Open the fucking door, mommy. Mommy. Open the door, mommy. Shit. Mommy. Open the door, mommy. Baby come home. Come home. Open the door! Come home. Now. Please. Kathy! I'm in here! Hurry hurry! Kathy! Baby! Baby! The camera. The camera. The camera? Where's Bri? She's fine. No she's not! She's fine, she's crawling around the room. No she's not! Kathy! She chased me! Oh my god, she's right behind me! Okay, hold on! Yes. Yes Mr. Taylor, I am. What's wrong? I need your help sir, please. Excuse me? I'm in my house. Wait, wait. Leonard, are you here? Please bless this house. Mr. Taylor! Kathy? Brianna? Is that you? No! Brianna. It's Pastor Hunt. Not Brianna, Pastor Hunt. You're not welcomed here. In the name of the holy spirit. I order you to leave this house of God and to release this child. No no no! You will release this child. You have no place in this home. In the strength of the holy spirit, I cleanse this child. Jesus. What's wrong, pastor? In the strength of the holy spirit, I cleanse this child. I rebuke this demon out of here! I rebuke this demon out! I rebuke this demon out! I rebuke this demon out of here! I rebuke this demon out of here! I rebuke this demon. Pastor Hunt, how did this happen? We go to church every Sunday. We're good people. Mrs. Taylor, a demon can just come across your path. So is our child possessed? No. I wouldn't say she's possessed, but I do think whatever or whoever is using her as a passageway. A passageway? When I came to the house tonight and saw Brianna I asked if it was her. If she was possessed she would've said yes just to get to me. She answered no. I just felt there was more she wanted to say. So you telling me a demon is trying to speak through my daughter? Well I'm afraid so, but we're not sure if it's a demon or a spirit. But what the hell is it? I don't know yet. But I won't stop until I find out. I promise. So what does that mean? That she'll turn into that thing again? I would say no, but with the dog being murdered so viciously, I don't know what will happen. Leonard, I don't feel safe in this house anymore. Mrs. Taylor, I understand how you're feeling, but the spirit has made a connection with your daughter. So you're saying it doesn't matter if we leave or not. Yes, I'm afraid so. So how am I supposed to handle all this? How am I supposed to protect my family? The Almighty One is your shield. If you sense another episode is starting, you need to start praying loudly. Find a scripture that's very meaningful to you and say it with passion. Do not fear. Because it will feed off your fear. Be very firm with it. And pray, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor. Don't worry. You'll get through this. Are you Brianna? I love you so much, baby. How you guys doing, baby? Honey, you okay? Honey, you okay? Please babe, don't be upset. How can I not be? I'm scared to death of my own child. Okay. I can barely even look at her. We have to stay positive, all right? "Stay positive." Shit, how? Kathy. How am I supposed to stay positive? Kathy, listen, Kathy. We'll figure this out together. Kathy, are you drinking now? Yes I'm drinking, Leonard! I'm losing my goddamn mind here! Okay, okay. Okay. And you're not doing anything to help the situation by the way. What am I supposed to do? A lot more than what you are doing. Kathy, maybe you need to get out of the house for a while. All right? You're right. I need to get out of this fucking house period! Shh, breathe. Kathy, please, you're not the only one. Did it kill your dog? No. It didn't. It killed mine. Kathy we're a family. It's after me! Not you. You know what, you're right. I do need to get out of here. I'm gonna go to this spa with Liz. And when I come back home, if I come back, maybe I'll be a lot more positive. Kathy. Come here, baby. Come here. It's okay. Come here. It's okay. Whoa, here we go! Whoa! I want mommy. Everything will be all right. Daddy's here. I'm not going anywhere. Come on, shh. This is for you, close your eyes. Everything will be right. Daddy's here. Hello? Mr. Taylor. It's Pastor Hunt. How are you two making out? Good, good. Kathy ended up at the spa. She's been gone most of the day. I see. Well we all handle stressful situations in our own way. Pastor Hunt. I don't know how much more of this she's gonna be able to take. It's a very upsetting situation. How are you holding up? Good. Just put Brianna down to sleep. How was the child's interaction with you two today? Good. As if nothing ever happened. Okay. Well I have some things I wanna share with you, but I wanna come by and talk to you and your wife together. Good things? Yes and no. There's some positives and some negatives. How bad are the negatives? Well the biggest negative is time. Time? Yes. We may not have as much as I thought. That's why I'm headed your way now. I'll be there in 45 minutes. Okay, good. Kathy should be back by then. I'll see you soon. Yes. Daddy! Brianna! The Lord is my light. And my salvation. Whom shall I fear? Daddy! The Lord is the strength of my life. Daddy! She's mine! Daddy! Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil. Daddy! Keep praying! Mr. Taylor? The Lord is the strength of my light! Of whom shall I be afraid? Mr. Taylor. Of the shadow of death I shall fear no evil. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Leonard! Leonard, hey. Come on. Come on come on. Come on. Come on come on. My bishop doesn't think it's an exorcism. Your daughter's not possessed. Like we spoke about before, she's being used as a messenger. She has something to tell one of you. The connection in the house- - I think it's me. What? What are you talking about? The spirit came to me in the kitchen. I actually saw its face. A face you recognize? Yes. Are you sure? When I was little, a girl came to live with us for a while. With you and your parents? No. My parents died in a car crash. I lived here with my grandparents. This girl came and lived with us when she was a teenager. One day. She just left. My grandparents said she ran away. And how old were you? Little, seven. Eight. It was her face I saw in the kitchen. Baby, I don't know. It was her. It was her. You still have the footage from the video camera correct? Yeah. Yeah, it's on the nanny cam. Can I see it? Yeah, of course. This. Is a new device. With many video cameras, a tiny amount of information from the infrared spectrum is recorded. This can filter that and enhance it. Really? Yes. So if this fits in here, we can pretty much see anything that comes across the screen. It's standard, so it should fit. Is this an easy process? This machine- - No, the spirit. When will this all be done? Mr. Taylor, how can we know the answer to that? How can we know when the spirit will be heard? The visual is a little blurry. Now. When you hit this. Oh my god! Please turn it off! I'm sorry. You don't need to see this. My peers are the ones that need to see this. They will have the answers. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put you... I'm sorry, man. She's having a really hard time with this whole... I mean I am too. No need to apologize. But if what you're saying about the girl is true you need to get more information. I mean is there anyone else you can talk to who might know more? My grandfather might have been able Haven't tried to talk to him in years. Well maybe it's time you gave it a try. Okay. Give me back my medicine! Give me back my medicine! Barbara, he didn't take your medicine. Yes he did. Get outta here. Excuse me! Only family members can come in before 3. I am. Bernard's my grandfather. You're not on the list, so. But he's my grandfather. Mr. Jones said he wants you to bring him them meds. Tyree, I can't right now. Can you just do your job? Jesus Christ. Hey! Hey! He's eating plants! Can you please stop him from eating plants? Hello! I don't think you understand. Bernard hasn't had a visitor in 15 years. I mean the man doesn't even speak, so I don't know what makes you think he'd wanna talk to you. No offense. My grandfather raised me since I was three. He's like a father to me. I want him to see what I've grown to be. Oh my god. Please don't deny me that. All right, look, you have 20 minutes. Not a minute more. You can sign in over there. Hey! 236 is up the stairs to the left. 20 minutes. Hey. People on this wing can be a little touchy. I'm just letting you know. Grandpa. Grandpa, it's Leonard. I know it's been a long time, but. I'm married now. Beautiful baby girl. Brianna. You got a great-granddaughter. Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa it's me- - It's me. Leonard. Hey, hey! What did I tell you? He's strong for an old man, huh? And he quick too. That old man strength ain't nothing to play with. I know I haven't come to see you. And I have no excuse for that. But I'm coming to you now in need of help. I don't know what's going on, but my family's in danger. I've seen things that I can't explain. Your time is up. Please, just a few more minutes. It's his medication time. It's time for you to go. I saw her. I saw Crystal. Grandpa please! She has control my baby girl! Get this man out of here now. Hey! Hey, I'm sorry, you have to leave! Grandpa! You have to leave! No grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

Do you have a crush on someone? You do. You wanna put it in? It's beautiful. Well I think you're pretty special too. But you can't peek on girls while they're getting dressed. But since you're my special little cuddle bug I guess it's okay this time. You two better get on to the party. I remember it like it was yesterday. You remember what? You remember what? What'd you do? Okay you need to leave now. My baby girl doesn't deserve this, grandpa! This isn't over! Pastor Hunt. I think I know what happened. Meet me at my house, I'm almost there. Okay, wait wait wait. I know what happened. He has something to do with crystal disappearing. I know he does. He who? My grandfather. Here. This dirt was in my house before. As soon as I retrieve her body this will all be over. Her soul will be at rest. That bastard. I see we got the same taste. Huh? Crystal, go ahead and finish up those dishes before you go to bed. You understand? Yes Camille. And honey. Yes baby? I put Leonard to bed. And I'll be home around 8 AM, okay? Have a great night. You too, baby. Love you. Love you! Love you more. Crystal. Go upstairs, brush your teeth, and get into bed. But she asked me to put the dishes away. What did I say? Hey. ♪ Talking about my girl ♪ My girl ♪ No! No! Stop! Stop! Stop please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

We got a 1029, roll the ambo. It's. Not. Over. Good morning, Mr. Taylor. These are the rest of your grandfather's possessions the DA's office turned in to us. If you could please sign here. Thank you man. Yup. At least he don't gotta go on trial for two. Deputy Timmons. Two? Yeah. I guess there's no harm now. The coroner found out she was pregnant when she died. Really? Yeah man. Well. Sorry man. Have a good day. What's all this? Some stuff the sheriff dropped by. Stuff they got off grandpa. Okay. Mama? Let me see that picture, baby. Leonard. How could you? She can't have her!

Ever since we moved into this house! Kathy it's okay, baby. You said when you dug up the bones that it was gonna be it. That's what you said! No no no, babe, you're just having a bad stretch. No, you don't understand! She's not haunting your dreams every night for months. No, stop it! Kathy, Kathy! She can have her. Kathy what are you- - That is not my baby. What are you talking about? That is not my baby. That's not my daughter! Listen, you have to get it together. I need you. This is something we have to do. There's not other option, Kathy. Leonard, I love you, but I cannot do this anymore. We can start over! We will start over. We'll pray all night long. No! Without her! We're gonna start over without her. What the hell are you talking about, Kathy? We can have another baby! It's obvious that Crystal, the spirit, or whatever the fuck it is, wants Brianna! And if you can't tell. That is not Brianna anymore! There's not enough prayer in the world that could change that. Why are you giving up on your faith? Why are you giving up on us? I can't fight this! I can't fight this anymore. What do you want me to do, Kathy? I want you to man the fuck up! We're giving this baby away. I can't believe you wanna give her away! Leonard, we don't have a choice. How are we supposed to do this Kathy? A shelter. An orphanage. I don't know. I don't care if we gotta go to a goddamn police station. Kathy. Stop it. Are you ready? Leonard look at me. Look at me. Baby look at me. I know this is hard okay? I don't wanna do it either, but we have to. We have to. Okay? We gotta go. It's okay. You'll be all right, baby. Okay. Daddy loves you. Daddy loves you.

With some chocolate chip cookie dough. So you want me to go to the store and get you some ice cream when you got this sexy chocolate brownie right here? Oh you gonna go on top of the ice cream. Baby if you go, you'd be the best husband ever. Plus I got a little surprise for you tonight. A surprise? Mmmhm. But I'm only gonna tell you if you get me the ice cream. You know I like surprises. If I go all the way to the store and get you some ice cream I want the freakiest sex ever when I get back. Okay, that's a deal. I'm serious, Kathy. I'm serious too, baby. Look, you go to the store. And while you're gone. I'll get in the shower. And by the time you get back, I'm gonna be naked. Matter of fact, I'm not even gonna dry off after the shower. You know I like that. I can't believe I'm pregnant again. Thank you God. Mommy. Brianna? Brianna. Yes sir. You got a good man, girl. It's about to go down. It's about to go down. Babe! I got the whipped cream and the strawberries! It's about to go down! Babe! Babe! Kathy! Daddy! I've been waiting for you. Do you have a gift for me? I miss you, my little cuddle bug. Pastor Hunt.
