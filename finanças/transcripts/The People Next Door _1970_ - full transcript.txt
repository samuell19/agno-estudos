Yeah, well, I was gonna tell you tonight, when I had my costume on, but... But that's wonderful! Two hundred bucks, huh? Well, some people have more money than brains. Pentagon said today that the present operation is an example of American and south vietnamese co-operation, driving the viet cong out of critical rice-growing areas. Advancing American units seized forward positions under intense small-arms fire... You gotta be kidding. You're not going out on the street like that, are ya? Whatever happened to civilisation? It's part of our thing, you know. Your thing, huh? Well, you'll probably be doing their thing soon, so you might as well have fun while you can. Oh, shut that stuff off, will ya? I'm sick of it.

If your sister suffers any kind of damage because of this, any permanent damage, you better start runnin', because I'm comin' after you, and I'll break every bone in your body! I don't respect you anymore. I think she's going to sleep. What happened? - I kicked him out. - No! Freaky little punk. Artie! Why would she take that stuff, anyhow? Is she nuts or somethin'? Perfect kid, normal as they come, a kid who's got everything. I think we ought to talk to somebody. Who? Who? A head shrinker? Absolutely not. What about David? I'm not getting the people next door - involved in my private life! - Arthur, please. - I want her to go to sleep. - Listen, gerrie, if you feel you have to turn to... To David at a time like... - Turn to David? - That's what I said. - We need advice. - You don't trust my judgement? Oh, it's not your anything, Arthur. It's our. We're failing. We have to face that. Look, if you wanna go to Tina and David, you go! Lemme tell you one thing. I'm not taking the responsibility for anything that happens after that. Is that clear? It's your responsibility. Go ahead. Go. You know something, Arthur? Every time we come to any kind of a crisis, where... Where a decision has got to be made, you get furious at me. That's a lie. And refuse to take any responsibility. That's a damn lie, and you know it. I'm going next door. You do that. Hey there, gerrie, are you and Arthur going to be home later? Oh... oh, yes. Yes, I imagine. Well, there's nothing much doing on TV tonight, so Gloria and I thought we'd rather look at you and Arthur through a Martini. What do you think? In about a half hour, okay? Okay, gerrie? Is she mad at us? Have you been eating her geraniums again? - Mrs Mason! - Oh, Sandy. - Is there something wrong? - Oh, well... sort of. Is your father home?

It's all over. It's just a clean-up job now. Arthur... Gerrie told me the bare details on the phone. Look what they did to your office, David, and you're the principal. David, what the hell do you do for kids in this world? We did everything humanly possible. I mean, we gave her tennis lessons, piano lessons, cheerleader, good home, good neighbourhood. - Gave her love. - Love? Of course we gave her love. I know, I know. If we were a neurotic bunch of... You know what I mean. Then I could understand, but... Oh, excuse me, gerrie. Would you like to sit down? No, I'm fine. Would you like some coffee before we start? Oh, yes, please. Just black. Do you have a dime? Yes. I'm afraid to look at what they did in the library, but I've got to. How about that? Right through the door. They finally found a use for books. Oh, here, David. I can't understand why they didn't destroy the coffee machine. Even I agree the coffee machine is a bourgeois plot. ♪ The filaments within ♪ sweet medusa ♪ I'd like to play your game ♪ our children can come to us about anything. They know that.

But we did! But did you really want to, sweetheart? Or were you afraid? Tell the truth. I... I have to admit that I was at fault myself, because I didn't insist on it sooner. But...

Darling, it was a mistake. Anybody can make a mistake. We're going to forget that it ever happened. There, now. Now, now, darling. Everything's all right. - Isn't it, daddy? - Yes, baby, everything's fine. - Just fine. - I can't help it. Well, darling, try to stop for a minute. Daddy and I want to talk to you. Not now. Please, not now. - Do you wanna go back to sleep? - No, I... I can't. Is there any particular thing you're crying about? - Baby, everything's fine. - No, I just feel like crying. Come... Baby, I... - Maybe if you went back to sleep. - I don't wanna sleep. I'm gonna sit up and wait for Artie. - Darling... - Let me handle this. Maxie... Maxie, we know Artie brought you that stuff. What have you done? - Well... - I sent him away. Artie? - You kicked him out? - Well, your father felt that... We know how much you love your brother. He's our son, don't forget. This is hard for us, too. It's... it's hard for your father, much harder than you think. You know what you are, daddy? You're a jackass. She's trying to protect him. It's always like this. He lies, and she swears to it. You're both jackasses. I think we ought to wait till tomorrow to talk about it. I think we ought to talk about it right now. You're not going to like it. May I have a drag of that? I didn't know you smoked. There's a lot you don't know. Go ahead. This is not the first time I've tripped out. I've been up at least fifteen times. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. I've tried all the grooves, even horse, but acid's my scene. You... you talk like... Where did you get these words? This is me, daddy. This is me. My daughter's sick. My little girl is sick. I'm not sick. You are. - That's why you're so miserable. - I'm not miserable. At least, I wasn't. You know, you oughta drop a little acid. Like... See god, mom. See god, huh? You were really seeing god when we found you in that closet. I was on a bad trip. That can happen. Shouldn't have taken speed with my acid. Arthur, I'm going to be ill. I have to get out of here. No, darling, listen to me. - But... - No, you just sit down here. Gimme that. Now, aside from your freaky brother's influence, what got you started on this stuff? My brother's influence has always been to tell me to leave this whole scene alone. I don't believe that, but go ahead. I took acid because I wanted to be a better person. It's a fine way to be a better person, all right. And also, I guess, because you and... Mom and the world in general just keep me uptight all the time. We keep you uptight, do we? What... now, how do we do that? Just by being ridiculous. You know, dumb, phoney. You... In other words, you hate us. Yes, I... I think so. You say we're dumb. Waell... Can you give me an example? Well, like everything I tell you, you believe. For instance? Like if I tell you one of the kids is nice, you both say, "oh, that's nice. "Then you can spend the night over there because it's a nice family." And that kid might be the biggest head you ever saw. In other words, to trust is to be a fool. You are a sick person. Mom, we didn't talk about my sex life. What's the matter? You scared to ask? Well, your worst suspicions are true. Would you believe, this morning? I wasn't at the hospital like you thought. I was with a boy. You know, fucking. What boy? You'd try to hurt him, wouldn't you? You're sixteen years old! Oh, shit. It was that Elliot boy, wasn't it? Sorry, daddy, I'll have to take the fifth on that. Anyhow, there was another one before him. For more than a year now. Oh, don't worry, mom, I'm not gonna have a baby. I'm on the pill. Where would you...? You're sixteen. Where would you get such a thing? It's easy. All the girls have 'em. Ones that want them. - Am I losing my mind? - No. - Did I cause this? - No. You've been a good mother. I'm not gonna let you take the blame for this. She's no good, that's all, she's rotten. - It happens in a family sometimes. - Oh, she's sick, she's sick. You and daddy did it before you were married. I heard you talking about it. You remember Sharon, that used to come and spend the night with me last year? Dr Bernard's daughter. Well, she used to bring her father's stethoscope, and we'd go into the hall and put the stethoscope on your bedroom door. Daddy! - We've got to get her to a doctor. - She's not sick, she's crazy. - Arthur... - Kids nowadays are crazy! Don't you understand? If she weren't sick, this couldn't happen.

Oh, it's all right. I can get some more. - No, really, thank you. - Okay. Bye-bye. Sit down. Well, from what you told me about this boy on the phone, I should talk directly to the father. Oh, that'll never happen. Believe me, I know this guy. No, I was thinking that, by talking to you, I'll get a better idea of what to tell him. You know, some sensible advice. Tell me about this guy. - The father? - Yeah. Oh, he's, er... I guess he's just your average Joe. Maybe a cut above. You know the type. He works hard, he likes the fights, he drinks a little too much, that... that kinda thing. I get the impression he's a... He's a pretty good father. - At least he tries to be. - What doesn't the boy like about his parents? Well, they had a talk with him, and, er... They found that he's, er... He's pretty hostile. - He calls 'em phonies, stupid... - Are they? No, not... Not for my money. Not any more than anybody else. At least they're trying to understand, to... To improve the relationship, which is a hell of a lot more than that boy is doing. I mean... You ever been skin diving? - Skin diving? - Yeah. I mean, I never thought I'd communicate with a fish until I went scuba diving. You stand in front of one of those fish tanks, stare in at this dumb little fish, and they stare back at you, and... Nothing. And then you go down into their world, swim around, hell, they'll play tag with you, they'll tease you, seem to grin at you... They communicate. Oughta try it sometime. Now... What specifically did this boy do that got you, and his parents, - so upset? - Not me. I... I wasn't upset. - Not personally. - I understand. After all, he's their kid. “What... what did he do? Well, he took some LSD, right in the home. - Mm-hmm. - He had one of those bad, er... - Trips. Bummer. - Yeah, that's it. Then, this... he ran away from home and his parents found him all the way down in the east village loaded with drugs and in bed with a... With a girl, one of the ugliest... What did the parents do? They took him home. What else? That's it. They don't know what to do. - Okay, I've got some advice for you. - Great. Run, don't walk. Family therapy. You mean, send her to a psychoanalyst? "Her"? Did I say "her"? No, I meant... I meant "him". But don't send him. Take him. Family therapy. - The parents, too? - Parents, most of all. Oh, he'll... He'll never do that. Well, you talk to him. No, I know him. He's not the type. You... you fry to convince him. Nobody... Seems very talkative today. Frankly, doctor, I don't think we were getting much done here in these sessions. How many of 'em? Four? Five? All I've heard is what a big phoney I am. All right, maybe I am. Personally, I don't think I am. But, if my daughter wants to tell me that, let her tell me for free. Nothing personal, doc. What do you say to that, maxie? I... I... I don't know. You must have some thoughts about it. Not really. How about you, gerrie? Well, I... I know it is expensive, but it seems to me that just the fact that she's coming here with us, and... and... and sitting here is important. Do I have a choice? Maxie, would you do me a favour? Maybe. Every time you come here, you wear those dark glasses and that scarf, so I can hardly see you. I'm passively alienated. She memorises these damn phrases and then just can't wait to use 'em. You're a pretty girl. It would be nice to see you while we talk. Much better. Thank you. Maxie, why do you think your dad is a phoney? Well, for one thing, he's a tail-chaser. Do you care to amplify that? I've seen him with a woman several times. Maybe Arthur has an explanation. I've known for a long time. - By any evidence? - No, I... I just knew, that's all. Women always know. Sometimes you're wrong. Oh, when we suspect it, we can be wrong, but when we know it, then we're always right. Not always. Always. Whether we admit it to ourselves or not is another question, but... I did admit it, and I decided to live with it. But maxie couldn't. Is that right, maxie? I couldn't care less what he does. That's his thing. Let him do it. Just like suffering is her thing, and pryin' into other people's business is yours. So why can't I do mine without being bugged all the time about it? Your father's crying, maxie. What do you think about that? Hmm. I didn't think he could. Now, look... Look, about this afternoon. I. - Gerrie, I'd like to say one thing. - You don't have to say anything. Damn it, yes, I do. - You can cry if you want to. - I'm not going to cry. Well, whatever you feel like. You must know that it wasn't anything you did or didn't do. - Please, stop it. - Well, it was... It was just a weakness on my part, some kind of a damned no-good streak of... Gerrie, nobody ever got close. It was no closeness or anything like that. It was plain, irresponsible animal instincts. And one other thing, I always felt... no, two things. I always felt ashamed every time, and I'm ashamed now. That's... that's one thing. And the other thing is... The other thing is, I'll never do it again. I smoke too much. I don't give a damn what the inventory says, you... - Arthur. - I'm in a big hurry, della. Arthur! And then, to lift them out, raise the heat about 380, 480, nearly up to 500 degrees fahrenheit. You've been acting funny all day. Della, I'm due at dr margolin's office. Art, go check warehouse three, see how many three-quarter-ton units we have on hand. I've got four trucks waiting for this shipment right now. Are you mad at me about something? Della, gerrie knows about us. Look, now, I'm not firing you. I still want you to work here, but the rest of it... Better not try to treat me like an old kleenex, Arthur. I... I can't talk to you now, della. Answer it, bastard. Well, just look how old they are. I mean, how would you like to have folks that old, huh? I just hate 'em, that's all. I mean, it's dumb for two old people like them to have a baby. What would they wanna have a baby for? I mean, my mother was forty-five years old, and my father was sixty, and look what they got. Me! Look how I look. Why couldn't you think of the kid before you started havin' a kid? Why couldn't they just say, "okay, okay, "we're too old to have a baby"? But my father. He's gotta go and prove he can have a kid. All for his own ego. Well, I hate both of 'em. I wish they would just die. I wish I would die. When I was still tryin' to graduate high school, before I even realised what a dumb brain they'd given me with their old beat-up bodies. I used to hate it when they'd come over to the school and I'd try and avoid being anywhere near them. Sorry, little problem on the job. I told everybody they were really my grandparents. Well, look at 'em! Look at 'em, they're disgusting! I mean, how would you like to be a kid, tryin' to... tryin' to play baseball, and have a father that's eighty years old? I hate him. You know, I... I hate you. You are a shit! Why don't you just go away some place, and... and die? Just die. Well... Who has a comment on Wally's statement? Nobody? Well, surely somebody has something to say? Yes, I do. - You've got no right... - I don't wanna listen to you again. - You sit there and talk to... - You know, he's got a comment on everything, and he doesn't know anything about anything. - But, do... - But he's just told me... Do you have a comment, maxie? Yes, I do. You don't mind, do you? Ladies first? Go ahead, maxie. Well, first of all, the more I come to these gross things, the less I know why I'm here. I mean, these meetings are really gross. Well, these group sessions might get a bit gross sometimes. This, um... This person over here, this... This Wally guy, he just wastes our time. He's a nut. What about this sweet big baby? Big authority on every subject. Well, he makes me sick. You all make me sick. If I had some acid, I'd... I'd drop it right here, right now. - "Drop it"? - It means "take it". Do you see what I mean? Well... I don't wanna come back here anymore. - What do you want, maxie? - Out. I want out. Of our world, you mean? Yes, I'm gonna find a new reality. - With drugs. - Yup. But let's think about this a moment. Isn't running away from the world as it is, away from reality... Isn't that a kind of death? Well, what's so bad about death? It'd get us out of this. Hello, maxie. How are you? Watch it. Thank you. Excuse me. Do you like that? Hey, is this new? - Where'd you get it? - I bought it. No! You know I can't drink. Come on, it's a celebration, sweetheart. Look at her, dancing with a boy with a haircut. A boy who likes school. All she needed was a little wholesome family fun. Come on, come on. Arthur! - Arthur... Arthur! - No, let's go. Beautiful! How did I ever do that all night long? What's that you're smoking? Grass, man. - You want some? - Are you kiddin"? Let me see that. Hey, hey, what's the matter? What did I do? What's... what's goin' on? Hey, stop him! - Break it up! - Smokin' pot in my house! You all right? Yes. He's just a little, er... Loaded, that's all. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have been so mean, Arthur. Well, maybe we all oughta try it. I hear it doesn't give you a hangover, the way Martinis do. You're beautiful, Tina. - We should think about going. - Why? It's early. Come on, let's go. - Did I hurt you? - No, man. I hope not. Good night, good night. Well, we'll have to say good night, Arthur. - Yeah, I married a wet blanket. - Good night, David. - Thanks, Arthur. - What's that, killjoy? Oh! Tyre chains. Sandy, Sandy, come thank mr Mason for your tyre chains. - Oh, wow! - Oh, how much do I owe you? - Forget it. - No, no. Hey, I really appreciate these, mr Mason. Here, let me have your keys. I'll put 'em in your trunk for you. Oh, don't be silly, mom, I'll do it. No, no, no. You stay here and have fun. - No. - Yes, sir. You haven't even had your drink yet. He thinks if he doesn't drink his drink tonight, maybe I'll let him have... bye! Maybe I'll let him have two tomorrow. To tell you the truth, mom, I really don't want it. Now, sneaky, sneaky. Let me have your keys. Probably go off with some girl, and get stuck in the snow. Huh, would you believe that boy? He's gonna marry that car someday. Oh, well, he can marry anything he wants. As long as he's on the Dean's list, we don't care, do we, smoochie? Hi, there. ♪ Old man trouble, I don't need you ♪ I just want you to stay away from my door ♪ just you stay away from my door ♪ now, I got rhythm ♪ I got music ♪ I've got my gal ♪ who could ask for anything more? ♪ She had a ball, sweetheart. She had a real old-fashioned ball. And so did you. Maxie! Maxie! Maxie! Oh, maxie. In my judgement, your daughter has taken a large dose of stp. Stp? Isn't that the one that's so dangerous? - Sweetheart... - It can be, yes. We have no antidote for stp. We can just try to keep the person quiet and wait till it wears off. I suggest you go home and try to get some rest. Doctor... Come back at ten o'clock. Yes, but... Why do you suppose Sandy wouldn't let me have the keys to his car? David? Tina, for Pete's sake! Those diet pills are making you downright kooky. I'm sorry. You had enough to drink to put a horse to sleep, and now look at ya. I can't help it. What are you doing with this? What do you think? I'm selling it. David... Now, look. The kids are taking this stuff. I mean, not me, but a lot of the others. Maxie got it from you. Well, they gotta buy it from somebody, right? So, why not me? Besides, do you think I can get along and buy school clothes on that lousy little allowance you give me? That lousy little allowance is your father's life blood. You get a kick outta scrimping and saving. You always have. And how do you expect me to buy gas, to get back and forth on the weekends? And this is easy. There's nothing to it. Till you get arrested. No, the cops almost look the other way. There's... there's so much of it, they're embarrassed. If they tried to bust all the grass-heads, they'd be putting their own kids in jail. Aren't you afraid that we might have you arrested? I know you, pop. I'm your fair-haired boy. That's the biggest kick you have in life, telling everybody how great I am, how I'm gonna be a big lawyer someday. And you're right. I am. You wouldn't bust that up. Not for anything. You couldn't take it. So, in a way, it's, er... lucky for me that you found out. Because, now that you know, you'd be sort of... Accomplices. And I can keep the stuff right here in the house. I... I hate sneaking, anyhow. I'm sorry. Oh, wow. I really am. That you're so shook up, I mean. No, David. Not the police. Not now. We have to have time to think. Somebody has to start somewhere. 178 east 3rd street. 158 east 7th street. It's a shame for you to be wasting your time like this. That officer just violated my rights. They'll let me go immediately. As a citizen, I feel you could make better use of your time - trying to catch criminals. - Let's go. Let's go. Did they really have to send four of you guys? We've sent for a peer to come sit with her. - A peer? - Yes, a peer, an equal. Someone, er... they feel they can trust. Someone not of the establishment, if you will. And this peer helps us by talking them down, as we say. This is what they call a psycho ward, isn't it? Yes, an unfortunate name. It's also unfortunate that, for space and personnel reasons, we have to put a young girl like your daughter in the same ward with... Dt cases, heroin addicts who have oded, everything imaginable. Oh, just one word of warning. She may have an adverse reaction to seeing you here. Well, maybe we shouldn't go in. No, no, I'd like to see her reaction, but don't be upset if she doesn't seem glad to see you. Huh? Good morning. - Hi, doctor. - Morning, Jennifer. I wanted to ask one thing. Would it be all right if we tried to talk to her, and tell her we were wrong about something? Apologise, I mean. Do you think it would be all right? Try it, by all means. If she's receptive, it could be a big help. ♪ Ia da da Dee da Dee dum ♪ la da da Dee da Dee dum ♪ la da da Dee da Dee dum ♪ dum, Dee da da dum ♪ la da da Dee da Dee dum ♪ la da da Dee da Dee dum ♪ Dee dum... ♪ - maxie? Maxie. Maxie, we... We found out about Sandy. He admitted it to his mother and father. We want to apologise for... For accusing your brother. We know how much you love him... Arthur! Get dr Salazar! Get the key! - He's coming. - Get me out! Get me out! Hey, mom. Artie! I've gotta get out of here. I heard she flipped out pretty bad. So you're the, er... Whatchamacallit, huh? The... the peer? They said she asked for me. I made a pretty bad mistake about you, Artie. That's life. Help her get better. I'll try. Doctor. Maxie. Maxie. I'm gonna fix you a dinner you won't soon forget. I can fix dinner. You stay in that bed. Complete rest. I'm not a bad cook, you know. I'm not. Yes, you are. Come on, maxie. You can do it. Come on. Come on, now. Maxie? Okay, now you try it. Come on. Jesus, doc, that's rough work. I'll be back again soon, sis. Your brother says you are rough work, and you are, you know? Ach! Maybe we should walk you around outside for a while. It's a beautiful... You like it? Yes, it's very nice. Honest and truly? Honest. It's yours. You can have these, too. I hate 'em. You hate 'em? Hate 'em, hate 'em, hate 'em. Well, if you hate 'em, why do 'em? To please dr Salazar. If I please dr Salazar, he'll let me out of here. Oh, that'll be wonderful, baby. Maybe in time for your birthday? We both want you back home with us so much. Oh, you do, huh? You're gonna be happy, baby. Things are getting back to... Well, together again. Artie drops by more, a lot more, the last couple of weeks. - And your mom and me... - She's still in bed? - Well, she's... - She's chicken. I hate chicken people. But... but... I wanna come home. I really do. I mean, if dr Salazar ever thought that I... That I didn't want to come home, why... Why, then he'd never let me out of here. Daddy... - You like this? - Very much. It's just the same as this one. Daddy, do you think they're good? I mean... Really good? Well, I think they're good. I mean, I'm not... I'm not an art critic, but I... I think they show talent, yes. You really like to lie a lot, don't you, daddy? I only... See why I don't wanna come home? Lies, lies, lies! Oh, daddy, don't tell dr Salazar I said that. Please, please, I do wanna come home. - Don't tell him, daddy, please. - I won't. Anyway, really, I do wanna come home and be with you and mom. That'd be wonderful, baby. Just wonderful. I do, I do, I do... I do. I do. Daddy... Why do you want me to come home? Why? Because we love you, that's why. Liar, liar. - Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar! - Maxie, please don't. - I'm sorry. - Liar! - I didn't mean to get you upset. - Liar! Don't, maxie, please! Enough, maxie. That's enough. I'm sorry, I... I won't be able to see you next week. I'll be outta town. But your mother can call. - Tell her not to bother. - She's not allowed out of bed. Go away, please! Go away! I'll... I'll see you in about ten days, baby. He just gets me uptight. I have a right to get uptight, just like anybody else. It doesn't mean there's anything wrong with me. Arthur, does this stuff have to be done on a Sunday? 'Course it has to be done. I told ya. I mean, why me? Whaddaya mean, "why me?" Who else could I get who knows about air condition specifications at this late date? Nobody, I guess. What the hell's the matter with you? And what are you all dressed up for? I always dress up on Sunday. Arthur, is it really true that you expected Rafferty to okay the new specs on this city job, and he finked out on you? You get to know somebody, you'd think they'd bend a little. And if I don't reach the nine A.M. deadline tomorrow - with these new specs... - They'd cancel the contract. And you'd lose? This is the biggest job I ever figured, della. By my calculations, you'll lose about seventeen hundred dollars expenditures and about ten thousand dollars expected profits. That's right. I quit, Arthur. As of now. You're kiddin"! Ta-ta. Della, you can't do this! Wanna bet? Not at a time like this. A time like this is what I've been waiting for, Arthur. Well, how are we doing? She won't talk to me. Maybe next time. So long, doctor. I want out of here, and I don't wanna go back with them. And I don't see why I have to wait till I'm eighteen. Kids know a lot more than they used to when that law was made. - About some things. - About everything. Anyway, about important things. Is self-preservation an important thing? That's a trick question, and I'm not going to answer it. All right. Let's suppose your parents let you go free right now, be on your own. They might as well. In fourteen months, when I'm eighteen, I'm gonna do it anyhow, so they might as well. All right, let's suppose they do. What would you do? I mean, how would you arrange your life? Well... First, I'd take a long trip with my boyfriend. - Why a long one? - Because I never had a long one. I never had enough bread for that much stuff. What would you call "a long trip"? About a week. But if you didn't have the money before, how would you expect to have it now? I don't know. Somehow. What else would you like to talk about? When do I get out of here? We're working on that. On. I talked to her again this afternoon. She's... Still on the other side of a stone wall. But she has improved. Dr Salazar said that. "Steady improvement." - That's what he said, isn't it? - That's right. And I told him you were up for a while today, and he said he was sure you'd snap back just fine, sweetheart. Sometimes you wonder if you want to snap back. Does he know yet... Can he estimate how much longer she'll have to be in this... What a hideous way of saying it. This "controlled environment"? No, no. I asked him the same thing. It just depends. They... They have no way of knowing until they have more time. But what really bugs me is it all boils down to money. I guess everything does, sooner or later. They've got these private hospitals where they get the best possible care, where they have about two staff members per patient, plenty of therapy, everything of the best. Well, that's where maxie's got to be. Yeah, that's what I said. But these places run from about... Are you ready for this? Twenty-five to forty thousand a year. - Twenty-five? - To forty thousand a year. - But nobody can afford that. - We can't, that's a cinch. Well, what else is there? After that, it just drops way off. You... You get into the public places. And the worst part of it is, they don't really have a place just specifically for this kinda thing in most municipal institutions. I mean, she'd be in with addicts, ya know, heroin addicts, schizophrenes... Well, that's impossible. We can't put her in anything like that. I know. Arthur, are they sure? I mean, couldn't we try it just once more at home? Three specialists talked to her and they all recommended against it. They all agree she has very strong self-destructive urges. Well, couldn't we put her in one of these expensive places, just for six months? We could afford six months. Arthur, you're not telling me everything they said. Sweetheart, they think she may be in need of this controlled environment... Indefinitely. You don't mean for the rest of her life? It's possible. I asked them what would happen if we just let her go free, and they said she'd probably destroy herself eventually. I said, well, the way I feel now, instead of burying her in some institution, I'd just as soon let her go out and drug herself to death the way she wants to, and then bury her. But that'd be quitting, and we're not gonna quit. No, no, sir. There's a way. There's a good chance she can get well. They said that. They all agreed on that. That's... That's what we have to hang onto. Oh, come... Come on, now, sweetheart. Sweetheart, you know what Salazar said? He said she doesn't really hate us at all. The way he explained it is, she's grown old enough to see our faults, but just not mature enough yet to forgive them. Look, try not to think about it, sweetheart. Do you want anything? Maybe you oughta take a nap before dinner. That's it! Wait till you see what I've got you for dinner. Artie's coming to dinner too, ya know. Come on, now. You take a nap. I'm coming. Coming. - Arthur, hi. - Oh, David. - Can I come in? - Oh, please, come on, come on in, yes. Well, Arthur, you know Sandy's been out on bail, and we've been waiting for a trial date... I know you and Tina have suffered through this thing, too. Yeah, well, listen, we just got word, er... I want you to try to be calm, Arthur. We just got word that the charges have been dropped. - Some, er... - Dropped? Yes, technicalities, - illegal search and seizure. - You mean, no punishment at all? Now, I know how you feel, Arthur. I've been very upset about this thing, too, for you. Listen... - No! No! - Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute, Arthur! - Get outta that car! - Mr Mason! Hey! Help! My daughter's in an institution, and you think you'll walk around free? No! No! No! By god, no! He's... he's crazy! Crazy! He's going crazy! Arthur! Arthur! - No, we'll see if you... - Dad! Dad! Come on, dad, come on. That's not gonna do anybody any good. I'll kill him! I'll kill him, the cunt! Your... You heard him. He tried to kill me! You're my witnesses. I'm calling the police, and he's going to be arrested. I know my rights! I have always thought of myself as incapable of violence, but if you make one more obscene sound about your rights, you pollution of my life, I shall hurt you. - I shall hurt you. - Come on, let go, now. Tell him I'll break his back! All right, I'm all right now. Let's go. God, I hope your mother didn't hear. - Christ, I really blew! - As only you can. Slimy little bastard. "Case dismissed." Poor David, with a kid like that. Christ, he's sicker than... Well, you're here! - I bought some Chinese food for dinner. - Yeah. Lobster cantonese, "flied lice", the whole deal. - Whaddaya say? - Well, great! Good. Sweetheart, we've got a guest! Where is she? She's probably in the bathroom, primping. She can get up for a few minutes now. I could use a drink. How about you? - Well... - You know, I don't think we've ever had a drink together, just the two of us, in all our lives. - Whaddaya say? - Yeah, okay. I don't... you know, I don't remember who told me this, but he said that, "if you're drinking for pleasure, you sip it, "but if you really need a drink, that's business, - "and you never waste time in business." - That's right. What are you gonna do with yours? Well... Come on, come on, don't hesitate. He who does is lost. Down the hatch, that's it. There, doesn't that make you feel better? Now, let's go up and see your mom. Come on. I told her about all the offers you were getting, and she was very proud. Just goes to show you what I know about music. Nothing. Listen, Artie, don't say anything to your mother about the lobster cantonese. I wanna surprise her. Sweetheart? Gerrie? She's not here. Good evening. I'm mrs Mason, maxie's mother. Oh, I'm afraid visiting hours are over, mrs Mason. Dr Salazar said it was all right. Well, there must be some mistake. - He never does that. - No, no, it's a special thing. Well, if you don't mind, I've gotta call him. Well, he's not at home. My husband and I just had dinner with them, and they went on to a movie. Mrs Mason, I can't do it without his consent. I'll take full responsibility. After all, I am her mother. You see, it's a... It's an experiment in reality therapy. - "Reality therapy"? - Yes, that's correct. - Well, I suppose... - I'll go get her for you, mrs Mason. You can wait in the waiting room there, mrs Mason. Maxie. It's all right, maxie. You've been refusing my calls. Your father tells me you won't speak to him when he comes here. That's your way of punishing us. All right, I don't blame you. They're going to let you out of here pretty soon. You'll be on your own. Free, totally free. At least, that's what you think. But I know the truth. The truth is that you're going to be here forever. Oh, not here, because they can't keep you here much longer, and not in one of those luxury places for twenty-five thousand dollars a year, because we can't afford that. Finally, there's something, finally, that we can't afford to give you. You don't see the humour in that, do you? Well, neither do I. So they're going to keep you some place, some not very nice place, I'm afraid, forever. Or, if not forever, for a very long time. Do you know why? Do you? No? Then I'll tell you. Because you'd rather punish us for being human than try to get well. Because you're still a big baby, and if the game's not played your way, you're not gonna play at all. Well, I'm here to tell you that you're not gonna get away with it. I'm telling you, as your mother, that you are going to survive. You're going to speak to me, and you're going to survive. Now, turn around here, and look at me. I said, "look at me"! Now, tell me you're going to get well. Say it! Say it! Say you'll try. Say it! Say it! - Say you'll try. Say it! - Gerrie! Gerrie! ♪ Winds of change, they call my name ♪ Let's go, maxie. ♪ And beckon, "come" ♪ just like a moth to a flame ♪ and wherein lies the wonderwheel? - ♪ We've all been structured how to feel ♪ - Gerrie, listen to me, will you?
