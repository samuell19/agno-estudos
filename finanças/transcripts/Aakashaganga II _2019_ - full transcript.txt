Water. Water. Water, please... Water... Go ahead. - Water... I swear, I'll kill you if you're lying. Never ever in my life, I've gotten up so early. Don't you know that I'm not used to it? You see it for yourself. You get inside and watch the fun. Jesus! Just make it viral! Crazy! See him taking pictures. Bro, wanna get viral in Instagram? Yes, Beautiful! Awe! As if she is the 'BELLE' And you the 'BEAST' Dude, she's coming. Jithu, we're online now. - Yes. Give a space man. Let me also fit into this. Dearies, we're standing in front of. Sreekrishnapuram Parthasarathi Temple right now. Meet me, your chap Titus. - And myself, Jithu. You scumbag Jithu, return my shirt you dumbo. It's been two weeks since you've taken my shirt. What on earth, your fans're violent? - Who commented it? Mathu. - Dear Mathu, How shameful is to send out for your shirt and undergarments? It's better you publish a 'Look Out' notice for it. Wait! Wait! Wait! Friends, The poster girl of Kalyani Institute of Medical Science. A true revolutionist. Our one and only University chair person, who's a reformist and a hardcore atheist... You're gonna watch the very same Arathi Varma here at this temple. She unleashes atheism in public, And prays to God in hiding. We bring in lime light, Arathi's fake atheism on this Live platform. Get me on your Live. Listen friends, this is not the real version of it. My ideology and beliefs are still the same. Today is my Mom's 20th death anniversary. My dad wants me to perform oblation for her. But, I don't believe in those outdated rituals. Understanding this, My dad wanted me, at least to accompany him to the temple. This was the least minimum thing I could do for my father. Other than that, I'm neither changed nor will change. I hope that you're smart enough to realise the tactics of scrupulous opposition parties. Catch you later. - Bye. Catch it. Hey guys, Wassup? See dad, they're up for ruining my political future. Is it Jithu? - Uncle... Will you ruin my daughter's political future? You too Brutus! You're the upcoming doctors of this village. But, you still are kiddish. Its just a fun, uncle. We follow Arathi's lead. Come along with us. Have breakfast and go. No, thanks! We can't bare with old vegetarian dishes. We need a minimum of 'Appam' and 'Egg curry'. Otherwise also, no one wise would invite you. Come, dad. Let's go. See you. Our plan against chairperson didn't work out. She's unreachable for us, dude. That's it. Don't scoff it. But you said these coconuts are for extracting oil? You simply do what you're asked for. Don't neck into my affairs. This is not extraction but intractable action... -What? I mean the oil extraction is difficult. Is that so? Put that aside. Most of them are dry coconuts. If at all there're good ones, they're already inside his tummy. No wonder! How come you gobble all of it? I just thought of not wasting the dry coconuts... Very interesting. You went to temple, Arathi? What a surprise! I don't think she would get inside the temple. True that she entered temple since I compelled. But, the atheist inside her is still strong. Ain't I right, daughter? Listen Unni sir, Otherwise also, these 'isms' are always irritating. Bharatha, enough of making fun of my daughter. Making fun? No way! This Dia... dia... - 'Dialectical logic' You should've brains to understand those. Is she an incarnation of Karl Marx? Doesn't she look beautiful than ever? Mayamma, my mom? She's at her teens for ever. Have breakfast, It's time for college. Go along, kiddo. - Aren't you hungry, Unni? Let her eat. I'll join. Let's go. Mayamma was just one year younger to me. Though 20 years have passed, everything's still lingering in my eyes. I remember her first scanning post-pregnancy. Doctors then, advised an abortion since baby was too big in size. But, Maya didn't agree. If abortion had taken place, I wouldn't have been alive. Ain't I right, aunt? This is Fate. She gave up her ghost soon after her delivery, without even waiting to see your face. Eat Kiddo. Hey, Remya! Come, sit. Happy birthday, Arathi! There's nothing to be happy about my b'day. Today is my mom's death anniversary too. Oh! I forgot about it. Sorry! Leave it, did you have your breakfast? Nope, food isn't ready at home. Moreover, your Idli's are my favourite. Sundari, get her a plate. Is this the way how you eat at 'Kovilakam'?' This... Even the cats here eat more than this. Dear Varadha, eat slowly. It would get struck into your head. God knows how his body manages the food he eats. A keg full of porridge, and fifteen coconuts right in the morning. Touch Wood! Dear Sundari, Learn to respect those people who eat well. Ours is a place of sick people, who can't even eat one 'Idli' all together. Yes, yes! Very true. He eats a big container full of rice for lunch. And 5 kgs of boiled tapioca in the evening. He eats like an elephant and looks like an earth worm. God knows whether any Somalian ghost is there inside his body. No way a ghost would enter his body. His hands, ears and neck are covered with defense stuffs. This is some eating ailment. At least, spare your own fingers. A handful of servants like him is more than enough will ruin this 'Kovilakam'. Eating Giants! - I'll show her my true colors. Sundari, don't try to make a fool out of me. There's a limit for everything. My entire body is a defense against ghosts like you. Wanna see it, - God! See it. I don't have courage to see it. - Don't you see these hangings? You know nothing of this 'Kovilakam'. The incidents here will keep your fur stand on end. Why to speak of something you don't have? Stop kidding. 20 years back, when Mayamma died at her full term, even I was there besides her. After Mayamma was burnt alive on the funeral pyre, three more unnatural death happened here. Grandma and uncles. All of their ghosts were roaming around here. Do you know that? You could hear ghosts howling every single night. The 'Yakshini', trapped by' the dark magician, Meppadan was out again. You can't imagine the pain he bared to chain her again. Don't you hear the noise of chains at night? That's why I am saying, listen carefully. At any moment in this house... Sundari. - Sundari. Sundari. - What happened? What happened, Sundari? - Shucks! What the heck Varadha? - No, this is not it. What if coward people like you become doctors? What crap! - Will you stop this? Listen to what I say! - What is it? It's different when you get to talk to ghosts I have experienced it. Why do you talk about ghosts? Are you mad? You'd better consult a psychiatrist. I'm not lying, I swear. Are they here to study medicine? Or to bellow like bulls? Why do you cook up stories right in the morning? After all, you shouldn't gossip about your own dad. Hello, I very well know my dad's voice. I'm sure that it was my dad's spirit. Why should I lie about it? Doctoring is not your cup of tea. You'd better go for some black magic and earn pennies. Otherwise also, I needn't convince people like you. You speak as if I work as the marketing executive of the 'Ashram'. Yes! - Don't believe me if you don't want to. It's true, but you don't believe. Yes. - You have to say something we can believe. Trust me, please. Dear healers, zip your mouth. I'm loosing my concentration. Healers? That's your dad. Call us doctors. Doctors?! You speak just like this! Drive properly, you dumbo. Who the hell taught you driving? I just need a phone call to get you unemployed. Know me? Why not? The uncultured son of our Cultural Minister. How dare you say I don't have manners? Are you doing yoga in the bus? This would happen if tipper drivers are allowed to drive bus. He is worse than an auto driver. Okay, leave it. I wanna speak to him, lemme sit here? - No. Please dear, lemme sit here? No. - It's urgent, please. Sit on his lap, if you want. Stupid, why do you stamp on me. I'll stand if you say so. Gimme way - C'mon, leave. Move aside. - Would you sit on the lap? No need, I will go to the last seat. I feel comfortable here. - Yes. Yeah, I know. What is it? - Even I thought so. What is the matter? Nothing. But you said, you wanna talk to me? I was just tricking him. Back seat jerks more. You don't feel jerks here? Not so much... It is good with variety rice. Don't nose dive into gutters, you driver donkey. Why did you apply the brakes? College is here. Get down. It has already come?! Not healer but doctor! Understand? - Manufacturing defect, what else? It is your birthday, saree looks better on you. Why did you change it? Don't you know that I love you wearing saree? That's why I changed my costume. Oh! Why is this big attitude today? What the heck did you comment on my Facebook live? What did I say? - 'Beware of fake atheists' Oh! That's the thing. Ain't I right? I know many of your party leaders who go to temple secretly. I also know it. Once you believe in God, the heart will be at peace. You know Govind. - Yes. He was a hardcore believer of God. A very virtuous person like you. It's clear from your cooked up stories. Hey, it's not cooked up... This is 100% truth. Trust me. Should I believe it? - Yes. Arathi, do you know what Jithu told us? - What does he say? His gone father talked to him, it seems. How come? His father is no more. I swear, I'm not lying. It's true that I heard his voice. In fact, I went there as my uncles's escort. There was a saint there. He took me inside a room. Inside there was a book like this. Shut up! - He is always playing pranks. He asked me to keep my hands on a book like this and to think of my departed father. When I was thinking of him. Suddenly, I heard my father calling me. Mother promise. Liar, liar, liar. The lie of the week. It's for your scorn, you got balls on your eyes. There are some truths. - What rubbish are you saying, Jithu? It's true, Arathi. I can prove it. You may also come with me and see. You yourself test it. If it fails, you'll walk nude in this corridor, agreed? Would you still take up the challenge? Yes, of course. I take up the challenge. You mean, the challenge of walking nude? - Okay. Hey, big brother! How are you my bodybuilder? Don't blabber too much. Since I've accepted your challenge, come to me only after I've proven it. Jithu, they're tricking us. They collect our details in prior, without our knowledge. And reproduce them before us in the name of God. Duffers like you believe it as well. See Aarthi, you've been belittling me for sometime. See, I've experienced it directly. Seeing his confidence, I'd like to test it. Let's go? I'm ready. After all, I can hear my mom's voice. I'm also ready. I wish to speak to my grandpa. Heard he has buried treasure under the mud. If I get it, I'll share half of it with you. Really? Then we're friends. Come. This is the place I told you. Open your eyes and see it. What else do we see it with? I did not believe till I came here. Do they all come here to meet ghosts? It is better if you remain silent. See, he's Thimmayyan Swami. He's manages things here. But, you were saying about some 'Devi' here?' You can't meet her that easily. She's the head. She built this 'Ashram' after returning from US. It was him we met the last time. Anyways, come. - We take your leave now. Okay. - It looks nice. We will come again next week. - Let's go. Greetings, priest. - Greetings. May you live long. - Greetings. Who're you? What you want? I wanna meet my grandpa. Okay, is his spirit employed here? That is not it, Thinmayyan swami. Not Thinmayyan, I'm Swami Chinmayan. Sorry! - You're Rajendra's nephew? Yes, I am his nephew. - Okay, come in. Did you see, let's go. I had booked an appointment to meet 'Devi'. Out of thousands of bookings, Devi meets only two people a day. His uncle works here as engineer. So, I couldn't deny, as well. But, I'm not sure whether you'll get permission to meet 'Devi'. Please consider, priest. We wanna meet the spirits. When I told them that I spoke to my gone father, Even they wanted to speak to spirits. That's all? Lemme see. You needn't meet 'Devi' for this. Is this all true? Are they real spirits speaking to us? Why doubt about it? There exists an energy, beyond our knowledge and consciousness. Devi Saumini is someone who's accessible to it. She receives the energy directly from that energy source. Thus, she has access to everything. Who wanna speak to the spirits? - I... Only one at a time. Not more than two for today. Who's coming? - It's me. Will you come? Come. - Then you go. Come. I'll test it first. Not a kids play, be careful. One guys who tested spirits here, is in the mental hospital now. Dude, whose idol is this? He's the one who's worshipped here. Unlike others, people here worship Negative power. See his might. Do they worship 'Satans'?' Whatever, you get instant results. Like Supersonic. What is he called? Yamandan Bhargavan. Yamandan Bhargavan. Who's he? Not Yamandan, it is Yamakanda Bhairavan. The king of devils. But, those who worship him are bestowed with anything. We offer him Goat blood and Arrack. He surrenders at a single call of Saumini Devi. Bhairavan. What happened? Did you speak to him? There was nothing there. Fake. What he said is all a lie. I didn't lie. His grandpa would be scared to meet him. When his grandpa was sleeping, this chap thrashed on his head. He will never ever come before him. Not head, it was on his face. Not necessary that the spirit should come every time. Now you try, Arathi. Let's see whether spirit comes. C'mon. - Let's see. Is Don't get scared, come. Sit here. Please sit down. Keeping both of your hands on this holy book, think of your Mom and close your eyes. I'll be there outside. Arathi. Mom? Yes, your mom. I'm happy now. I'm an ill fated mom, who had to give up the ghost without even getting to caress my daughter. Is this you, my mom? You don't believe this, do you? I had made a bracelet, using the 'Navratnas' given by your grandma,' for you to wear after you're born. I have kept it safe inside a jewellery box in your dad's room. It's wrapped with a red paper. You go and check it. Look, sis. I can't clean the room at the rear end. Urine stinks all over. Might be some dogs or cats peed. The roof is full of Civets. You just pour some water and clean it. Don't blame animals. But blame humans. Humans peed? - Yes, in his room. Don't talk rubbish. Are you here to spit on my dignity? Such an indecent fellow. Washroom is next to your room. Why can't you pee there? How mean, Varadha? Dear sis, it's been some time I peed. It doesn't stink. I pour water every time. Did you wash it with water? Ask him why he poured water over there. Why did you do it? Tell me the truth, Varadha. Other wise, I'll inform Unni. Dear sis, I did it out of fear. I woke up at midnight to pee. But I heard a weird sound from the washroom. Cling! Cling... the sound chains. Also a howling accompanied to it. It was the ghost. I swear. I saw it through the windows. I peed out of fear. I don't remember what happened there after. Disgusting. Peeing at this age. But I can believe that you saw ghost. He's good at gossiping. What ever, it's too bad of you. - What's the matter, aunt? Tell me... - Please don't say it. She's the BBC channel of this panchayath. Don't ever repeat this. - Sure. Aunt, where're those jewel boxes kept in dad's room? They were shifted to the next room. Why do you want it now? There's something in it. Aunt, aunt stop. What is it? Did you find any bracelets inside the boxes at that closed room? Goddess! Did you open the room? Nobody opens it. What is there in it? Nothing but... Nobody opens it. That's all. Our elder uncle's son, Lord Devan, was a painter. Only his paintings and a few archaic vessels are there in that room. I saw everything. Tell me this, were there two bracelets inside that box? How did you come to know about the bracelets? From Unni? Tell me, aunt. It's Unni himself who shifted them to the Bhadrakali temple. That was your mom's gift for you. But, Meppadan Thirumeni advised not to wear it after Mayamma died. Leave it, you come. I'll get you a coffee. Come. I'll be right back. Arathi. Arathi, daughter... - What's wrong with her? What the heck are you doing? Goddess! Put back the bracelets. You shouldn't take it. But, you only told me that these bracelets are here. Does it mean that you can take it at your will? Keep it inside. I tell you to keep it back. Hats off to her courage. Varadha, lock the door. Okay. - Let's go. It's bats all over. Such irritants! Such irritants, just to scare people. We should destroy its habitat. - How come these many bats? Normally, we get to see them only at night. Better not stay here anymore, come. Earlier, we had routine 'Pooja's' here. Then, your dad was an atheist like you. It's recently he started believing in God. Since Pooja's were not done accordingly, It's 'Meppadan Thirumeni' who asked us to close the temple. And just to have an annual 'Pooja'. Didn't you know that no one is supposed to open the temple in between? The revolutionists now, are unaware of our rituals and customs. Who're you? Leave me, I say. Arathi. What's there? Nothing, aunt. "Who bestowed upon you, those lovely eyes?" Shucks! It's pitch out. If you sing like this, it will be a disaster. Sing properly. Let me go for a comedy, then. "Who bestowed upon you," "those lovely eyes" Stop it, Gopi. Stop! Go for some other 'Raga'. Even the lyrics are problematic. Listen how I sing. This is the real tragedy. "Any fool, if rich, can become a doctor" "Pay money and join them in our college" Superb. Isn't it? This is how you should sing. Sir... the problem... - What problem? This is a college started by my family in my grandma's name, spending million of money. At least, show some gratitude as long as you study here. Where on earth you'll find AC in a college? Yes. - We study medicine, not Mechanical Engineering. He said that there's no facility here to learn medicine. Did he say that? Don't blow things out of proportion. Not coz you're an anatomy professor, everyone calls you 'Dead' You're a dead body with no brains. Laugh on! Everyone should opt a job, matching to his skills. Yeah! I felt it when you take classes. I know, you meant that my degrees were bought in markets. Nope, I didn't mean that. We could see more number of ghosts, if you had left teaching and pursued doctoring. Thank you... Sing Gopi. "Any fool, can become a doctor" "Pay money and join them in our college" C'mon, sing. Dude, better sing. "Any fool, can become a doctor" Let Gopi sing instead of him. - Dude, come along. Gopi, sing with less of actions. Later. - Sing later, why? Come. - Sing whatever I've dictated. I'll tell you what to sing next. Come with me, I say. I'll be right back. Why is he getting down? Might be to seek my blessings. Nice guy. Then you stand up. Sir... - Bless you... Come, come, come. - Why? Are they in love? I'll ruin his love. Let them love, bro. I'm fond of lovers. Haven't you heard my love story? - Listen. She has been waiting for me for some decades. Isn't she cute? You never look like a Romeo. Don't you need some manliness for such things? I mean... She would've grown old by now. - Yes, of course. She's the mother of six kids of mine. Can't you measure my manliness from this? How many children do you have? Not yet a father. Less count... What's your count? - One lakh. But, two lakhs is the ideal... Would you like to borrow one lakh...? Manliness, it seems. Okay, sing. Oh! He's gone. What's the matter, tell me? Didn't I tell you that I wanted to see you? I said like that since you didn't come. Come to the matter. Didn't I tell you something over the phone, yesterday? Oh! Is that you're talking about? Leave it, dear. This is just an illusion. Think of its logical side. But... I got scared yesterday night. So, that's it. Is this how all revolutionist behave? Keep it to yourself. - Get lost. Your first fear is your 'Kovilakam', itself. The scary stories out there. Ghosts, Spirits... Black magic... Why blame me? Can anyone believe that a girl from that 'Kovilakam' is an atheist?' Then, I'd better change my ideology for having born there. Better not dispute over your ideology. What I meant to say is that, You being a girl of that 'Kovilakam' would've a smell of it. You mean, 'the smell of the ghosts'? - Nope. For those living in such situations, can have such illusions. Didn't you read Dispensa? What did he say? There is a strong invisible connection between... Consciousness and the thoughts created in your head. You don't have to teach me all these. I'm saying what I have experienced yesterday. Everything's still there in my eyes. I'm scared to sleep alone. Oh! Don't worry. I'll also come with you. I'll reach there by 11 p.m. Then we'll hug tight and sleep together. Gopi, should I also accompany you? Nope. I'll handle it myself. Get lost, man. Shameless fellow! Hugs and kisses only after marriage. Who's gonna marry for such a silly thing? What did you say? No body buys a theater in order to watch a film. You just wanna get rid of your fear, right? And... for me... - For me... For me... - Tell me, you stupid... You! Stop there. Say it once more. Bravo! Got the stuff. We got it only coz I'm the principle of this college. What did you get? - Dead body. What an insult. Call it 'Corpse'. Not 'Dead body'. Hey man, this is not it. I'm tired of hearing that there is no anatomy lab or dead body here to study. But we're re-opening the anatomy lab of this college. With an A-Class dead body. Dead body? - A-Class? Yes! It weighs about 170 kg. Sure that he digged it out from somewhere. Do you remember the mess you people created for a corpse? News, Poster campaigns... Trolls... What did you say? That you would learn anatomy on Principal's body? You scoundrels... - Sir, please! Sorry, sorry. Chair person, reply me. Dear sir. We protested only because we didn't have a cadaver to study. Do you think you're freedom fighters to protest like this? Sir, it's very important that we lift up the standard of our college. Our college is going up by all means. The seventh floor construction is on. Didn't you see? This is why I tell you to concentrate. No body values the students here. No wonder. Only duffers like you're studying here. The minimum qualification to become a doctor... You need to be a stupid person, what do you say? Not in our brains but in our bank accounts. Money! Million of money! Aren't you Minister Mathai's son? Rich enough, eh? True that I've given a huge donation for my seat here. From which university did you pursue your MBBS. And MD.? Jallianwala bagh university. Jallianwala...? - Why the heck do you bother it? As long as I'm not practicing. I tear flesh only for teaching. If so, our principal's degree is... Just shut up, man. Dead body is waiting for you. Please go to the lab! - Go! Move fast! - Let's go. Grammar is fine? Its over? - Yes, sir. Chairman and team, come. So, you were the rebels. Good that the cadaver is wearing an underwear. What crap! Students, let's go to the abdominal system of human body. Move to this side. Gopi, cut it. Alas! Why did you get out of the anatomy lab? This is not a legislature to walk in and out at your will. Sir, this is cheating. Cheating? what are you saying? We asked for a cadaver and not a living body. When you tear off someone, make sure he is dead. I had a doubt when you told it was an A-class dead body. He would've injected drugs in him to get him unconscious. Now, when he is out of that intoxication he roams around like a ghost. We can't take it easy. - Solve it, right now. Without bawling, come to the matter. This is an original dead body, sanctioned by the health ministry. Sir... Lemme tell you the truth. - Tell. That... Tthat is not a dead body or a cadaver. Then...? Can you get me something to drink? It's a live body! Hello, brother-in-law. What did you send yesterday? Dead body or a living body? Our students cut open it. Now it is walking, it seems. If caught, we both are screwed. What the heck man? I didn't hear anything. Dead or not? I've informed police. He kept his promise. Shall we scoot? - Shucks! Bro, who's the in charge here? He's the in charge of Anatomy lab. Though I'm the in charge of Anatomy lab. He's the in charge of the entire college. Dr Damu; MBBS, MD, FRCS, DM, Neuro... What else? Hello! Don't try to make a fool out of Inspector Balram. Inspector Balram? Baalaraaman. What is the name, Balaram? Who's minister Mathai's face? - Face? He is asking whether Mathai sir's feces is here for any lab tests. No, sir. - By face, I meant son. His kid. - It's me. It's you? What is the issue here? I had a call from Mathai sir's office. That's why I turned up immediately. It's related to a dead body. - What? It's a cadaver, not dead body. This cadaver is alive now. The corpse at our anatomy lab attacked them, it seems. A corpse in the anatomy lab? - Yes. Yes, the corpse we brought into our anatomy lab is violent now. That's what they're saying. What? How can a dead body get up? Would anyone wise waste time on it? If so, do you wanna hear about a genuine case? I'm asking you. Didn't you send people to dig the graveyard of St. Mary's church. Who? Me? Yes, you yourself. The principal of Kalyani institute of medical science digged the grave, it seems. Don't you remember you entrusted a quotation team to dig the grave for dead bodies? Finally you got caught by the public. And got thrashed by them. Do you remember it? - Nope. Not even a vague memory. I'll help you to recollect it. That grave digging case is not yet closed. But, this is a dead body sanctioned by the health ministry. We've the documents. How will I know it? - But, I should know it. Before that, I wanna see the dead body. Where's the lab? - Upstairs. Show him. - Come. Where are you going? Come along. Is it where you keep stinking dead bodies? Yes, the anatomy lab. You get inside first. But, he is in charge of it. - Then, you get inside. But, it's you who wanna see it. I've seen it already. Let's do one thing. Let's all get inside together. Good idea. Get inside. Don't scare. Come along. - I'm there. I'm a person who has won Bravery award from the government. Should be duplicate. I will show you how it is given. Have you made pickles out of body parts? Don't worry. I'm there. See, they were gossiping about This poor man. Yeah! True. It's an A-class dead body. Must be he gobbled everything in front of him. And died of blasting belly. Dear, there's nothing fishy in it. Sir, but... Don't utter a word. It's just because I got a call from the minister's office, I'm here for this trifle. Don't ever dare call me for such silly-billy things. I'm a busy-bee officer. Understand? Son, tell your dad that I've taken good care of this case. So, lemme go. - Okay, sir. When minister calls, what is the proof that I've come here? There's an idea. Let's take a selfie together. Pose, all of you. Feeling dead, good caption to post on Facebook. Get Smiling. Shucks! The current is gone? No problem. Flash is there. You... stop there. Get up. I did not do anything. Are you happily enjoying the scene of police getting thrashed? Let the students here use your dead body to study. My knowledge is limited to answer your questions. Only Saumini Devi can answer you. But, you can't meet her today. Come again, tomorrow. She's taking a vow of silence today. Vow of silence? Can we just speak to her for a minute, please? The day Devi observes Vow of silence, She neither speaks nor meets anyone. Won't she speak at all? Do you know means of Vow of silence? - What? She keeps mum even if Indian Prime minister comes for a visit. She speaks only after the 'pooja' tonight. Though she practices celibacy in this world, she has a mate in her spiritual world. The powerful, lustful... 'Yamakanda Bhairavan'. During the seventh hour of Friday nights, Devi performs prayer for Bhairavan. She offers him goat blood and arrack. And dances in front of him. She turns lustful before Bhairavan. Bhairavan comes out towards the end of the Pooja' and mate with Devi. The energy flows from Bhairavan to Devi makes her invincible. You please come back tomorrow. Come, let's go. Take a look. Bhairavan is a lucky chap. Having fun with Devi on every Fridays. Good deal, Isn't it? By this Ashram and Devi, I expected someone older than this. These guys have gone bananas. Don't try to make fun of Devi. - Why so? I can't be cheap in front of a girl, otherwise... That's not it. Please understand. Saumini Devi is not silly as you think. If she hears you gossiping her, through her sixth sense. She'll burn you alive. I'm sleepy. Let's have a cup of tea? Then move. I'll drive. - That's okay. Its too late. How shall I convince my dad? Don't worry about it. He'll be happy that you believe in Godly stuffs at least now. I will be happy. - Okay. These 'Poojas', rituals... there's a science behind it. Gopi had suggested a video on Paranormal Activities. I watched it, as well. So, ghosts exist? - That's not what I meant. Please don't beat around the bush. What happened? Where did we hit? I think we hit someone. Should've died. - What to do now? Lemme see. What is it, Peter? What is it? - Nothing's here. See the back side. - Nothing, either. Peter, any problem? There's nothing here. Jithu, that must be an illusion. Please stop, Gopi... - Peter! Hey, stop! Gopi, apply the brakes! What is happening? The handbrake did not work. Why didn't you put the hand break? That's not it. - What is it, then? There is a ghost over there. - A ghost?! There's a ghost there. But, none of us saw it. It's there. - Let's see. I told you before hand. You did not believe me. There's nothing here. Must be an illusion. - It was there. Where is it? You got us scared! There's nothing there, Peter! - Go and take the next seat. I will drive. - You got us scared unnecessarily. Listen to what I say. - Stop the vehicle! One chic and three chickens. Enough for tonight. What on earth are you doing on the road at this midnight? Our vehicle hit something... Oh! It's you? What says our minister Mathayichan? Why are you here? - Our vehicle hit something. But when we stopped the vehicle... Hit whom? We couldn't see anyone. Tell me the truth. Weren't you purposefully hitting someone to get a dead body for your anatomy lab? No, it's a ghost. I saw a ghost when I got out of the car to see what I hit. Don't scare me. I'm shivering with fear. Remember, the ghost who caught my neck from the lab? This is a real ghost, full naked. Real ghost, full naked, right? So, along with booze, you use drugs as well. Ain't I right? Men should be brave. Get back home, fast. Get her back home, don't loaf around here. Should I tell you again? go and sit in the vehicle. Keep your good night with you. First drop the girl at her home. Keep her safe. Go carefully. All of them have lost it. Naughty chaps. Let's go. When will these college students study if they roam like this? They loaf around more than they study. Otherwise, they'll have to seek father's government job after his death, like me. What if they become doctors? Cowards! You should've told this to me earlier itself. I could solve it in no time. Arathi. At least from now, don't blame me for these defensive threads. Listen, there is a ghost in our college. Can you arrange a magic thread to trap her in? Dude, he buys these stuffs from stationery shops along the lanes. It doesn't have any power. Yes. Originals are expensive. With these, there is a placebo effect. Of course! - Take this route. House is somewhere here. I remember coming here after the death of Mayamma. Why is his house in a jungle? There's no one to help us. Our way is blocked. It's a bad omen. Let's move it away? Gopi, someone is coming. Let's ask him. Bro, where's this magician house? Not magician, he is a ''Tantri'' (Vedic Head)' Bro, Is this the way to magician Thirumeni's house?' But the road is not good. Difficult to get the car there. Is it far from here? Just a two minutes walk through this way. Okay. Then, let's get there walking. How can we leave the car here? - Let's go. Is he crazy to build a house in this jungle? This is a short cut. Didn't you hear him saying it? You can see 'Vanayakshi' here. Ghosts are of different varieties. We reached? Truly a short cut. We reached the entrance. This entrance reminds me of black magic. They could've kept a hundial here. Could fetch pennies. Isn't this Tantri who saved her Mom from the influence of ghost? Not ghost, it was 'Yakshini'. Didn't you hear? 'Akashaganga'. This Meppadan caught her and flew her to the horizons. Have you seen this 'Yakshini'? What a question. I was assisting Meppadan to trapped her. Did you not feel scared? Are you scared, leader? Never! But this ambiance is a little scary. Let us stop here. Should all of us go inside? Follow my lead. C'mon. Why fear? Greetings. Wanna meet Meppadan Thirumeni. Is he not here? Is he not there? I think she's deaf and dumb. Its working only. We're from Manikyasseri Kovilakam. She's Unnikrishna Varma's daughter, Arathi Varma. Others are her friends. I'm Varadha Varma. Nope, Varadha Nair. Can we meet Mr Vishwanath? Ten years past his death. I'm his wife, Kausalya Vishwanath. What to do now? She's his wife, right? She might know other black magicians. Shall we ask her? Grandma, have you contact with ghosts? Rascal! What is this? - Why is she so angry? Why did you ask it? Let's go. - Just a moment. What is the matter? Aren't you Manikyaserri Maya's daughter, who died of bursting uterus? Death is following you. On this coming 'Karkidakavaavu',' at 11 p.m, it will happen. This oldie is smart. What did you say? - Nothing grandma. Nothing? - A selfie, please. Shucks! Get lost from here. Duffer! Scumbag! Get lost, all of you. Go out, I say. Arathi would die, it seems. - Will that happen really? Felt like bashing her. Thank me for your lives. Are you scared, Arathi? I'm not insane to fear a mad oldie's comments. She's magician's wife. Beware of her. Anyways, I'm off from work on 'Karkidavaavu'. You scared? - Never. The stomach is upset since morning, don't know why. Stop, stop, stop. - What happened? What happened? - My munchkin! my sweetie, - Who is this? I miss you. Whenever I see minister Mathaichan, I inquire about you. Do you know something? - How can I know? I'm not a swami. - Just listen to what I say. He is very down to earth though he is the son of a minister. He has peed on me many times when he was small. He was too kinda naughty. It was on his face he peed. I'll introduce myself. I'm the zonal secretary of KK Mathai group. But son why did you come here? Can't you simply dial me for any help? We're here to meet priest Vishwanath. That black magician, Vishwanath? A decade past his death. Yes! His wife told us. - Which wife? Even she gave up her ghost long back. I've been casting her vote every year. Isn't it Sunny? - Yes. We had gone there once for a real estate deal. But there was no one out there. His only son is mad. God knows where he is. He had a younger sister. No body knows where she is. The whole family is ruined. My house is nearby. You're welcome. May be later, You leave. Okay then. Convey my regards to your dad. The fake vote thing, just ignore it, okay? Don't buy that plot. Its full of ghosts. I had given a try earlier. Then, who did we meet there? We need to figure it out. - Let's go again? This place looks different. This is like 'Ooty'. Why is it like this? - Must be some magic. These are ghost plays. What says, Ms Atheist? Hello, how can I be responsible for this? Stop fighting. Let's see who that oldie is. It's better we come another day. What is all this? Where is Varadha bro? Did he remain here? - [sanskrit chants] Varadha bro. Why getting scared? Come, let's go inside. O God! Walk fast like you did before. They are treating like a goat. That oldie has turned into a heap of filth. Step back! Escape! Take it off. Waited long, didn't you? Normally, Devi meets no one on the day of 'Pooja'. Hey priest, that day... - Don't be afraid! But, she'll meet you today. Gopi Krishnan and Arathi can come along. Both of you go. Dude, I have a doubt. - What is it? Is it with this God, the celebrities does Naked pooja and all. Naked Pooja? Don't talk rubbish. Get lost. Hey, that guy... - Hi Swami. I was clearing a doubt. A doubt! Yes! Please sit. Devi will join you. You explain it yourself. Sit. We had come here a few days back. But, we couldn't meet Devi. Then, Arathi had talked to her mom's spirit. After that, there has been many senseless incidents happening around us. Arathi sees scary things, latest being yesterday night. Arathi doesn't believe in spirit or spirituality, Ain't I right? Some people believe it and some don't. But, you shouldn't be in the middle of two. That is dangerous. The lady you spoke to, the other day, was your mom itself. But... The scary things you see now is not done by your mom's spirit. Haven't you heard of the story of a maid at your Kovilakam, who was burnt alive in the funeral pyre? Yes. - Now, she has turned out to be a powerful and revengeful 'Yakshini'. You people call her 'Akashaganga'. But, heard from Unni uncle that she was conjured by the black magician, Vishwanath? Though this powerful ghost was relieved from your mom's body through 'Dahanahomam',' she was not fully destroyed. That is why Maya died of uterine rupture, when she was giving birth to Arathi. It is this ghost who caused the unnatural death of your family members. But, Unnikrishna Varma alone had a brilliant escape, then. Later, Vishwanath entrapped and conjured Ganga inside a Bhadrakali temple through powerful 'mantras' and 'Poojas'. But, her fate was to get relieved by Arathi, the baby girl given birth by Maya, who was bearing Ganga's spirit inside her. That is, by your hands. And that has come true. Vishwanath had given a warning... If Ganga comes out again, no one of the Kovilakam would enjoy a marital life. Also she would retaliate to the extend of ruining the family. We had visited Vishwanath's house. But there also, we went through strange incidents. I am Vishwanath's daughter. Will you be able to help us, by any chance? I'm happy to help you. But the rituals here are a little wierd for a common man. We worship negative power. So, even the Poojas would be alligned to it. Rituals should be done at the earliest. before this July 31st. The lunar phase of the new moon of this month is on July 31st. The 'Pooja' should be performed before that. Gopi, please sit outside for sometime. Gopi. Keep it with you. Come here, Arathi. Have it. Is it gold? Of course. It's gold. Saumini Devi doesn't give it to everyone. Anyways, lemme keep it. Good to pledge. Will she herself solve the problems created by her? But, its us who came here and nose dived into problems. That's not an excuse. We need to file a case against ghosts. Saumini Devi is gonna be in. - Shu up. We came here, out of our respect for Saumini Devi. - Yes. And we follow her lead too. She's coming. Arathi, what did she tell you? - Come with me. Why is your face sulky? Come, let's go Did you notice one thing? This lady also mentioned the same date that the other oldie was talking about. The date I would die? - Silly girl. Will I ever let you die? As if 'Yama' is his bro-in-law. Touch wood, bro. Even I've seen such scary dreams before. When I tell you about the scary nights, you used to make fun of me. I doubt you're a bit scared now. Never! - But, you look tensed. Who told you that it's fear? Not scared but a bit tensed. Aren't you? Shall I keep it in your room? No, pass it on to me. I respect your profession and passion. But I can't agree to your ideology of atheism. That's why you see night mares. That's not your business. Aunt, I'm going to sleep. Good night. Hey, cross with me? I was just kidding. If so, good night to you as well. Shall I accompany you tonight? No need aunt. You sleep here. I'm comfortable upstairs. What a wind? Like a storm. Guess it will rain. Is there any offering in the groves? What a smell! Do you know me, Arathi? I'm Ganga. Would you like to come with me? I'll take you forcefully, even if you don't come. Who is it? Good morning Unnikrishna Varma. - Hey, Ravi. Long time... I never expected you to come. You must be busy with your business in Australia. Sit dear. - I reached here yesterday. It's when I come down to my home town, I relax. Long time since I've come here. May be last on the day of Maya's demise. Can't believe, 20 years have passed. Yup! Days go like supersonic. Tell me, what's up with you? I guess you're enjoying the lordship at this Kovilakam. How funny. I'm the manager of a granite shop in the town. Bad choice. When you've acres of land here, Can't you peacefully do farming? Isn't it more profitable than your granite business? Are you aware of the condition of farmers here? Farmers are committing suicide. Don't say that. C'mon, I'll show you how to do profitable farming. Otherwise also, God doesn't give swords to warriors. Why does he need swords? To cut apple? His tummy shows that he doesn't work but only eats. There's something else I wanna tell you. What's that? Though late, I've a girl in my life. She's a from 'Thiruvananthapuram'. A girl? Don't mistake. I meant... my wife. Her brother is a sub-inspector. But his official mansion is not ready at the place he got transferred. He doesn't have a comfortable stay. Later only, I came to know that. It is our own Sreekrishnapuram he is talking about. Why to search for another place when Manikyasseri Kovilakam is here. Exactly! Balaraman. Come. He's the one. - Balaraman, right? Sit. Thank you! Not 'Baalaraaman', I'm 'Balram' - Then? Inspector Balram. He's a big fan of 'Mamooty' films. He's cool. Inspector Balram I got it. There're a lot of vacant rooms here. - No problem. My official villa will be ready in some days. I can shift after that. - Your slang is funny. When I say few days, I mean it. This is how we speak in Thiruvananthapuram. You're a complete Thiruvananthapuram guy. Goddess! How foolish are you? Are you planting the sapling under a tree? You needn't teach me farming. There's shade under this tree. So, we needn't water it every now and then. Oh! Lord Krishna, He must be awarded for his farming ideas. Varadha. - Yes. Get his bags from the car and keep it inside. And get a room ready for him. Ravi, I hope you'll stay back for lunch. Why not? Long time since I've eaten from here. What else? Tou have to take food and go! - I will do that. By the by, where is Arathi? She's off to temple. Temple? How come? You only told me that she's an atheist? She was. But, today morning, she changed her ideology. Changed her ideology?! If Russia and China can change their ideology, why can't a union leader change her's? Temple visit with your love. It's awesome. Really? I don't know. But, this is a surprise. The ghost you're saying is just an illusion. I think you're pretty scared. It's not fear. I simply felt like coming to temple. That's all. What did Sauminidevi tell you? You didn't reply me when I asked you then. I was damn angry, then. - But why? Godly stuffs are fine. But, I can't tolerate nonsense in the name of God. Nonsense? What nonsense? She wanted me to offer my virginity to Bhairavan to escape from all the problems. My God! - She substantiated it, as well. It's just symbolic and is a part of 'Pooja'. What sort of Pooja is that? - I don't know. I should've thrashed her. But, I was scared of her black magic. So, you've started believing in Godly stuffs. Don't say that, Come. Oh! Have you started visiting temple? Where else she should go? Lord Krishna. After SI sir has come here, even I get to booze peacefully. Sir... - Did you get it? What a question? Booze would elope with me, if needed. But, it's too costly. All of the money you gave was spent for this. Even our government is meeting their ends with beverage money. But ultimately, they blame boozers. Bottle is here. Soda? Here. - What the heck is this? How does all this fit inside? There's an abyss inside. - Handle carefully, it would break. Is it edible? - Why? Just asked since it was kept in your underwear. I was checking. - The SI staying with us is good. They're coming. - I'll manage. If he is with us, we can do any work easily. Isn't that so? - What is it? I also said the same thing. You repeated it. Sir, good morning. Good morning, at this midnight? He meant goodnight. Why have you people rolled in? This is our house, as well. Gopi's girl's house means our own house. That's it. - In that case, you're mistaken. That house is next to this. Go through the corridor. That's fine. But what about the thing in your hands? That's nothing. We have seen it from the beverage shop. He had ordered a full bottle Brandy. I had a doubt, when he who drinks local booze ordered Brandy. That is when Gopi told me that you've come here for a stay. - Kiddo. I use it like a medicine. Two days since I've pooed. Silly, our's has been blocked since three days. Come, sit. Sit, sir. Gopi, sit. Do you know something? In our place, an inspector is treated like a Prime minister. Is that so? It is correct. Even at my place, I'm like a Prime Minister for them. Is there anything to order here? - I alreaady got the liquor. Do you've KFC chicken outlets there? No, KSFE is there. (Non banking financial co.) Don worry. There're two more bottles in his car. Then, get those too. We'll gulp it all together. Kiddo, go and get it man. - Finish this first, sir. This would finish in seconds. What can we do, can't avoid it. Unnikrishnan sir's son-in-law doesn't booze? Good. So, you're a vegan. He's a 'Loan-veg'. - What's that?' Even if he's short of money, he avails loan and booze. So, All big-wig boozers eh? Dude, you didn't go, yet? Go and get the bottles, you dumbo. Just go, man. Keep it there. What a quick boozer are you, Bheeru? Shut up. Don't dare to call me 'Bheeru'. (Coward)' Those daring can call me 'Dheeru'. (Brave)' Is it not the right name to call someone who peed inside the room fearing the ghost. Get lost. I'm not scared of anything. Like Meppadan, I was performing a special 'Pooja' there. What for? From today, I'll dare to get out at midnight. Why? Any guess? Coz, we've inspector Balram with us. No wonder people call you coward. Do you know it? - What? Don't you know Meppadan who conjured the 'Yakshini', Ganga?' I've taken up His job. But, who's this 'Vidalayakshi'?' Not ''Vidalayakshi''... it is 'Yakshini', 'Chu'... Smoke ghost, blood ghost, snake ghost fire ghost, lust ghost, nightmare ghost... All these ghosts have separate rooms here in this Kovilakam. Oh! Nice. Whose room is this? For the past 20 years, this room has been allotted to 'Rakthayakshi'' who slugs the blood of people. Which ghost did you say? - Don't get scared. Give him a peg more. He'll sleep by your side. I'm comfortable anywhere. No need, sir. He performs worst when he's drunk. Then, it will be difficult to face Unni uncle. You do one thing, have this and... If any ghost asks you, don't give her the booze. Let's go. - Okay. This is for me. This would be useful for us to drink at night. One should have the courage. The poor SI! - You are too much drunk. Don't know how he can sleep! SI sir, good night! "We are people who enjoy a drink!" Okay Balram. Who's swaying the chair? Stop it. You should have that fear. Wow! In this cool breeze... Who's there? Who's cooking up a mess over there? Who the dogs are howling there? Who the hell is blowing the wind? Scumbags! What the heck? Have that fear. I'll thrash you out. Don't dare play with me. You'll loose. Where's the switch? Who's lying on my bed? Oh! It's you? But, how did you get in here? Get up, get up. I hate sharing my bed with someone. Get up, get up, Get up, you duffer. Hey muff, get up, I say. Wow! Lying on my bed, wearing my costumes. Rascal, get out of my bed. Mr Varma! Mr Varma! Is there anyone here? God, my legs... I'm not able to take it out. My legs, I can't take it out. Please save me! It is coming for me! Please save me! Save me! Someone please! Save me! My legs... Sir, your cab is ready. I'll have to bare this pain for some days. I'm sick. O God! Hey, pricky cat. Why do you damn stare at me? Ghosts come in many forms and shapes. Kill you. Get lost. How healthy I was? See my condition now. They build such huge houses. It seems that they rented it to ghosts. Alas! I am not able to handle this. Alas! Where's the inspector sir going? Your legs are broken? But, yesterday night, you were alright. What you said has come true. What is it? Who did you tell was staying in my room? 'Raktharakshasu'. You scum... I'll give you a knuckle sandwich. If ghost was a real thing, couldn't you tell this seriously? Did you see her? I saw it, upon Goddess! If you had seen, you would've given up your ghost by now. I swear, I've seen... - You don't worry. I'll bring holy water from Mariyamman temple. You mix it with Jawan and slosh. - What Jawan? I mean... Rum. - You mean that? Show me your legs. - Alas, my legs! What happened, Balaraman? What's the matter? Mr Varma. Thank you for your help. - What are you saying? Please don't bother me. I'm going. But, why are you going? Yesterday night, ghost attacked him, it seems. Ghost attack? That should be your dream. Don't blab. I'm not a kid. I was scared to death. Its just that I didn't poo. Planets influence people differently. We had a discussion about it yesterday. I had a talk with Vishwanath's student, Anandan Namboothiri. So what? - He has agreed to conduct a 'Pooja' here. So what? - That Pooja will solve all the problems happening here. Not even a night mare would scare anyone, there on. That's his promise. - Blab again? This is not a dream but reality. Then, I'll come after the 'Pooja'. I'm not out of it yet. - What a pity? Police officers shouldn't be this craven. We were talking about you yesterday. That you're gonna be our strength. Really? Sir. It's the first time she's admiring a man. Must be she's attracted to your muscles. What are you gossiping about? He's a good company to booze with. Listen Balaraman, This is just an illusion. These chaps would've scared him with ghost stories. Yes. - If you've sprain on your legs I'll ask masseuse to help you out. - Why? A massage with therapeutic oil can heal your sprain. Good idea. So, you're saying that I should stay back? Yes. Even Sundari wants you to stay back. Really? See. - 'Two birds in a single shot.' Then, I'll stay back. Where's my bag? O God! This is what is called... Between the Devil and the deep blue sea. They might give me a company. Either one of them...? "You are a lovely girl and I a handsome man..." Oh! My God! What the hell? Get lost cat. Scaring people! Get lost, cat. How did you reach so fast? Sprain is on my knees. I'll rather wear 'Lungi' (indian cloth) and come. Don't you understand. I guess you couldn't catch my slang. Sir. Granny, wait, I'll come. Next week, you're gonna get a job promotion. Don't say something just for the sake. You'll get the order next Friday. Really? - Note it down. Are you an astrologer? You're awesome. I'm a jack of all trades, kiddo. I've been trying hard for my promotion. But, no positive signs. I don't have a good name in my department. I was all a mess at my work. Save the date. Promotion is in your hands. Really? If so, I'll give you a big treat. I'll come now. You be there. Though she was bluffing, it sounded good. These archaic switches! It doesn't work also. I don't mind to sit in dark. As long as Oppol and Sundari are there. "The lovely moon and lightning streaks" "The beautiful eyes are enchanting" Sir. Why the hell is she calling again and again? I said, I'm coming. Let me change my clothes. "The girl is objecting to come..." Who's this granny? Who are you? What you want? Unnikrishnan asked me to massage your feet. Another masseuse had come. Where is she? - Who are you talking about? She has balls on her forehead and make predictions. I'm the only masseuse here. Sit. Whatever, massage properly. I sense you're a good massager. Go on. The sprain is here. I'll set it right now. This stupid cat. Massage slowly. Where did it vanish? [sanskrit shlok] 'Aroodam' is not in sight. Who blocked it? Tell me, I'll thrash him off. Duffer! - Tell me. I meant, nothing is clear in this 'Prashnam'. Sorry, I didn't know that. But... what could be the reason? If the Chakra is not able to locate it, it means... Either the family has a bad time. Or a bad spirit has entered into this house again. My God! Maya Unnikrishnan Daisy Joseph. 'May be, this is the most beautiful period in my life.' 'Like a clear sky.' 'Me and Unnikrishna' 'I'm awaiting my little baby.' 'The surprising life incidents I had,' 'during the past one year is like a dream for me.' 'I just couldn't believe this,' 'how come a ghost enter someone's body' 'and turn a Christian girl into another person' 'of different community?' Certain things about your daughter, Arathi Varma is clear. 'Dasha-Sandhi' is not favorable to her. She's undergoing a deadly time now. Even death can happen. My Goddess! Lucky that we've identified it, now. Please suggest some ways to remove her 'Doshas'. There's a way out. Conduct Arathi's marriage before July 31st of this month. But, this is the month of 'Karkidaka'. Not a good time for divine matters. Otherwise also, it's just a few days more. Since this is a life-threatening issue, solving it is a bit risky. So, get prepared to break some rules. Find a groom, and conduct her engagement at the earliest. Gopi loves her a lot. He will be ready to marry her right away. That's true. Anyways, we also like him. You just talk to her parents. 'After conjuring Ganga through 'Dahanahomam',' 'everyone was relieved of their fear.' 'But, if anyone sees blood stains at Bhadrakali temple.' 'It has to be considered as a bad omen' 'for which we should seek immediate remedy.' 'Poor grandma,' 'She checks it everyday,' 'if there are blood stains on the steps of the temple.' 'God is with us. And everything's fine now.' 'Now on, I just think of my baby yet to come out.' 'Tomorrow is my due date.' 'I'll be admitted in the hospital today.' 'When I get back to Kovilakam, I'll have my baby with me.' Don't get late. Do what I said. Inform me the engagement date. Then, I'll get back to you with Pooja arrangements. So, see you. - All right. True that the Chairman is my brother. But, we'll get screwed, if he is not welcomed properly. - Okay... Sir, our Chairman is up at the gate. He will take a lot of time to get out. - Let's go. He is just rolling on and is not getting out. That's why I told, we have time. Sir, sir, I'll help you. Be careful. I didn't have to break open the door. Hey, you look tired. - Dieting, sir. What a match? Like Siamese twins. Now get it? Why they're taking millions of money as donation? Why? - His body is full of money. Exactly, a fatty dumbo. You should go to gym as well. All of you have turned up? - Bro... You keep it yourself, Damu. Principal, how are the classes here? Are the students happy? - Why not. They're tired of laughing. You know what, even corpse at our anatomy lab laugh at Principal sir's joke. I always keep joking like this. Is our minister, Mathai about to reach? Yes, in a while. Why did you ask? Treat him well. - Okay. This year, we should manage to get at least Ten MBBS seats from the government. For sure, as long as I'm the principal of this college. Yes, yes. Principal will get it. - Shut up. Ten seats means 100 million in pocket. Is that so? - Yes! By the by, his son is studying here, right? Yes! There he is; Titus Mathai. Hey son, my munchkin, come. How is the food here? Eat well, okay? Please let go my neck! Can you please leave me? Don't kill him. The minister will not allot seats. Sorry dear. You know, our chairman can't walk much. That's why he's sitting on the stage to welcome you. That's enough. He's too heavy for himself. Greetings! Hello! Welcome, the eyeball of our place... Get me down... Hey, he'll kill your dad now. Oh! I'm dying for it. Bro, leave him. What a herculean hug, Chairman! Remember, it's 5 million we donated for the last elections. Is this hug for saving that 5 million this time? This is love. Sit. - Thank God. Sir, please sit. Just a moment. What's up with you? Sir, I'm professor Joseph, Anatomy Professor. What is this anatomy? - God knows. Awesome Chairman... Where is Aarti? - She hasn't come yet, sir. Sir, I can't get her over the phone. Will you try calling her? What is the use of me calling again? Shucks! How irresponsible. Sir, Remya will sing. - Great. So, you sing the prayer song for today. But sir, Arathi was the one... No need of Arathi. - Sir, she reached. Hey, this is not a market to get in and out at your will. Leave your Chairman ship, if you're this irresponsible. Remya will sing today. Come Remya. That's okay. You're a bit much late. - Hi everyone. By this, we delve into the 8th annual day celebrations of Kalyani institute of Medical Science. I welcome Remya for the prayer song. She is translating our prayer song to some foreign language. She is tensed and singing something else. Get going. See her happiness after ruining an entire function. She might be your selection. She was a good singer. Don't know what happened today. Which language was this? What language is this? Anyways, not a language we teach here. The minister has to leave by two. Since, our minister has to leave for two, (local slang for poo) We'll cut the cake now and there after, his inauguration speech... If it is urgent, poo and come. We'll cut the cake there after. That's not it. I have another function at 2 O'clock. I told you earlier. - Okay, fine. Sorry, Two's got confused with. This is for the first time in life, I'm hearing such a different prayer. I'm very happy for it. Let's cut the cake. Hold it and come here. Shall I...? - Sure. My name is not there on it? What the heck? Let me go! Damu. - Spare me! What is happening? Sir, what are you showing up? What happened to you? Sir... What happened to you? - Get lost, I say. Please listen to me! Sir, please come back! C'mon. - Let's go. Let's run! Run all of you! - Come. Why are you sitting alone? Our principal has gone mad. He jumped down from the corridor. He's being taken to hospital now. Why are you keeping mum? Is there any connection between this incident and the one happened at our anatomy lab? What connection? Let him suffer for making fun of me. That's nice. Arathi! There're something wrong with you. Come. Get up. Did you have any fight at home, today? Or are you angry with me? I'm not angry with anyone. Did you know, Unni uncle had come home to speak about our marriage. What happened? Why hurry? I can't connect. Uncle was stern in his decision to conduct our engagement next week and our marriage, soon after the month of 'Karkkidaka'. Whose marriage? Our marriage. Aren't you the one more interested in getting married? Who're you to decide on my marriage? Don't you need my permission to marry me? I'm asking you. Arathi. - Don't dare call me so. You don't have the right to call me so. Do you know who I'm? I'm asking you. Where's Unni uncle? - He's inside. Okay. Gopi. Come. What's up? I've something very serious to talk about. About marriage? Haven't we finalized on it? Why? Are you tensed? That's not it. Didn't you tell us about Arathi's unfavorable 'Dasha'?' I smell a rat seeing her behavior at college, today. What happened in college? Like the incident at anatomy lab, something else happened at college today. I doubt that, today's incident has some connection with Arathi. Moreover, she blasted at me when I talked about our marriage. She spoke like... having some ghost's influence. By your marriage, Arathi's time is gonna change, for good. Till July 31st, she's gonna have a very bad time. That is why we've decided to hold your engagement before that date. Don't worry, son. Wait for the good. We're arranging things for it. Be happy for now. Hey, All have turned up? Aunt, Arathi inside? She's gone out. Out at some friend's house. I tried calling. Didn't connect. - Hello. All of you're here? This is a very special day for me. So, all of you eat some sweets. Don't be shy, take them. What's the matter? Perhaps you might be sad. I got a transfer. - Oh! Are you leaving? It's a promotion transfer, as Circle Inspector. Take them! This is special, for our masseuse. Where is the granny who makes predictions? I wanna give her a beautiful gift. Call her. Who're you talking about? Our Kausalyamma. She had predicted that I would get a promotion soon. Even the date she mentioned was the same. Where's she? Call her. - I wonder who that granny is. What is her name, you said? Kausalya. I've a sharp memory. I'll never forget her. Hey guys. Isn't he talking about the lady we met at Meppadan's house? Yes, that weird looking oldie. Exactly. She wears a 'Rauka' and stands bending. Yes, she's it. The one having balls on her forehead. Then, why did you say that you don't know her? Dear sir, she's a ghost. Oh! Is it? Ghost? - Yes. We're waiting to meet her. - Why? She's the one who told upon Arathi's face that She would die on July 31st at 11 p.m. What are you saying? - Yes. What Gopi said is true. Since, her predictions about my promotions were correct, Beware of her tongue. Goddess! Who's sitting here? What a surprise? How come you're here? Didn't you go to your friend's house? Gopi and others are looking for you. Kiddo, did an oldie at Vishwanath's house say that you would die on July 31 st? She should be mad. Did you get scared hearing it? No, I'm not. After all, I've died once. Cracking joke? Your time is not good. Thirumeni says that your marriage is the solution. That is why Unni sir is in a haste to get you married. Is your manager inside? - Yes, he is. He'll leave only after this offloading. Sir, come. Why at this late hours? - You're working even now? Just thought of meeting you. Sit. I had come in the afternoon. But you were not here, right? Heard your daughter's marriage is fixed? Yes, sir. Everything is set. I was busy with it. Never mind, it's a good thing. Hand it over to Josutty. Cash, 5 million! Okay, sir. - He wanted it as Black money. I'm leaving for Bombay, by early morning flight. That is why I brought it now. Call me after giving it to Joseph Okay, sir I will call you. - May I leave now? Yes, sir. - Okay. Don't forget to call me. I will wait for you. Goodnight. Okay, sir. - Okay. We've offloaded everything. We'll get the money tomorrow. Now, we're leaving. - Okay. Even I'm leaving. - Okay, sir. Who's there? Who switched off the light? Hello, what is it uncle? Hello Gopi, where're you? - At home. Please come to my office quickly. I can't open the door. There're some problems here. Please come fast. What happened? Uncle, hello! Who's there? Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Arathi! Arathi. Arathi! Arathi! Arathi! Uncle. Uncle. Arathi. Arathi. Arathi... Arathi. Arathi. 'Hello, It's from the hospital.' 'Unnikrishna Varma died.' Will you please let me meet Arathi? Arathi, dear..., Alas, what is this? Finally, everyone is here. See this. The burning funeral pyre. I'll kill you also like this. Each and everyone at Mangalassery is gonna die. Arathi! - Who are you? Who the hell are you to control me? Arathi is also gonna die in my hands. Let everyone die. Everyone... Like this, even you burnt me alive in a pyre. Didn't I beg for you some water then? Did you hell bother to give? Did you? I remember you, laughing mercilessly at my burning pyre. Do you think that I'll ever let you free? Never. I'll kill everyone... I'll kill everyone... I'll kill. Isn't it because he loved this poor maid. My Devettan had to drown his life on a single rope? Didn't you mercilessly kill my love, Devettan? Who else do you wanna kill? Tell me. You wanna marry Arathi Varma of Mangalaserry Kovilakam. Tell me. Do you wanna enjoy life after ruining my life? - Arathi! Tell me. Touch me not. Don't dare to touch me. Who the hell is your daughter? Tell me. Are they still waiting in the library? Yes. Hey, take a look. Doesn't she look similar to the oldie we saw at Meppadan's house? True. See, what is written here. Photographic images and drawings recorded in the United States. Strikingly similar to what is recorded in Europe and Asia. It means? It means, the ghost images across the world can have similarities. Oh! Dude, Devi is coming. Did you read it? - Yes. Ain't I right? Like Dissociative personality. Conversion reaction. Couldn't you find many more scientific names in these books? Didn't you read about such mental disorders in these texts? Yes. - Can you deny the fact that Tantri's and Black magicians, dating back to thousands of years had found out these things? - No. Philosophers might dispute. They can even win an argument saying that they haven't seen God. But, didn't you see ghost? - Yes. That's not just an evil spirit. That is the real form of a revengeful 'Yakshini'. Like 'Kannaki's' promise,' even this evil spirit has a promise. I don't think that you can escape from it. I'm ready to forgo my marriage with Arathi. But, I want her back, as she was before. If it was earlier, it could've been a solution. Ganga's promise that Arathi would not enjoy a mate. Now, it's too late. Earlier, it was like a joke for us. We never thought that this would turn out to be such a big mess. Only you can help us. She's howling like a mad. I know. My father, Vishwanath was very close with the people at Manikyasseri 'Tharavadu'. I'm ready to do anything and everything to save the last member of that family. But, we should conduct the rituals today itself. You had told us about July 31st. Even the granny we met at Vishwanath's house had predicted that Arathi would die at 11 p.m. on the coming 'Amavasya' day. Today is that 'Amavasya' day. I know. Both this granny and the incidents happened at your college are the stratagems of this evil spirit. Killing Unnikrishna Varma of Manikyasseri was a part of Ganga's revenge. She has succeeded in it and he is dead now. For the same reason, her vengeance would've subsided for now. If so, somehow convince Arathi and bring her here. Use force if needed. That's okay. I'll give a try if you can bring her here. I've sent people asking Anandan Namboothiri, my father's disciple, to come here. He deals only with Tantras. So, he calls me Black magician. I'm not sure whether he would come. Anyways, you bring Arathi here. What you're saying is true. But... I neither worship negative power nor do black magic. I know it. I know that, you being my father's disciple will do only moral deeds. But, do you think we can conjure this ghost using your Tantras alone? - No. She would never surrender. Chances are more that the main Tantri could get harmed. I'm not afraid of it. After all, I'm Vishwanath's daughter. That's why I've come immediately when you called. Moreover, I feel as if my guru's soul is asking me to save the girl of Mangalassery. If so, do support me. A method not preached by any Vedas, Upanishads or other customary books. A mix of Tantras and Black magic to conjure a ghost. I got it. I'm there to support you. If so, please arrange the 'Homakundam' and 'Kalam'. I've asked to bring Arathi. Okay. Be very careful today. Today is Amavasya of the month of 'Karkidaka'. I know. Guess Gopi is coming. How is Arathi now? She's not showing any agression for some time. I wanna take her to Saumini Devi's 'Ashram'. The evil spirit inside her, should be flushed out today itself. Hi, I'm Mithran, - Hello. from 'Puthumana Illam'. There's a message from Anandan Thirumeni. What's that? Today, there's a Pooja at Saumini Devi's 'Ashram',' to flush out the evil spirit inside your girl. That time, the family members should light lamps at Bhadrakali temple, and indulge in prayers, through out. Will she get out of this? Why doubt? The priest will do what is to be done. I will go now. See you. - Okay. Varadha, Open the Badrakali temple and get ready all the lamps. Go. - Okay, Madam. Gopi. This family is in danger again. Aunt, don't cry. We'll see. You get her here. Let's go at the earliest. Get going. My father died because of me. I killed my father. I'm a sinner. Tell me, Gopi. What happened to me? Tell me, please. There's nothing wrong with you. I know you're just consoling me. Every one is scared of me, now. Gopi. Don't abandon me. No matter whoever does. I'll never leave you alone. Promise? Promise. I'm there for you. I'm there. We must go to Saumini Devi's Ashram now. She wanted me to take you there. For what? She has made arrangements for Pooja, there. No, I'm not coming. - Why? We don't have any other solution, Arathi. What solution? Who're you to take me there? Arathi. - Get lost. I must take you there. I've promised. You should come along. What did you say now? Arathi... - What did you say now? What did you say? You! Arathi, leave me. Arathi, leave me. Arathi, leave me. Arathi, leave him. Arathi, let him go. - You! Leave me! Arathi! - Let me go! Oh! My Goddess! Please save her. This may be the first time you're performing Pooja with Beacons. But, the black magic here, doesn't use 'Nilavilakku'. (Lamp)' She travels just opposite to mine. A complete admirer of negative power. She wears chappals during Pooja, Eats meat. Above all that, it's goat blood and arrack she offers to her 'Moorthy'. But Chinmayan, this 'Yakshini' at the groves of Kovilakam' is far more powerful than 'Bhiravan'. Let's hope for the good. Keep it there. Leave, I say. - Come, Arathi. Come. - Leave, I say. No. - Come, Arathi. Leave, I say. - Come, Arathi. Come. Leave me. - Come. Come. - Come. Regardless of whatever you do, I'll kill you all. Leave me. Let me go. Arathi, stop. Come fast. Leave me. Jithu, come fast. Come here. Come. Come. Come fast. I don't want to come. Leave me. I'll kill everyone. - Come, Arathi. Get her inside, fast! Lift her up. Come. Come, Arathi. Come. Call her. The black magician, here. Lemme see how she's gonna flush me out. Call her. Lemme see her might. - Arathi. Who's she? Call her... Call, I say. Arathi, calm down. Listen to me. Arathi - Call her... Finally, you're here. Come here, you dumb. Who're you to flush me out? The maid of Manikyasseri Kovilakam? Aren't you Ganga? Yes. Yes, Yes, I'm... Ohm! Yamakanda Bhairava! Today, the 'Amavasya'. I'll show you my power. See that. 'Yakshini' Ganga, get out of this girl's body. No, I'll not go. I'm yet to kill a few people. You have even killed the last man of that family, Unnikrishnan. What else am I supposed to do with the people who burnt me alive? Get out of her body, I say. Leave Arathi alone. You shouldn't kill her. I'll kill her away. Won't you leave? - No. I wouldn't be asking you agian. Should I witness your ruination? Go out from Arathi's body. Didn't I tell you that I wouldn't go? Saumini, there's no use of begging this evil spirit. Let Bhairavan take up the rest. I'll go. I'll go. I'll go... Luck drawn from the past. It's a powerful evil spirit, that has been flushed out from Arathi's body. Here on, this soul will never disturb her. You can take her with you. Let's go. Arathi, come. Let's go. - Arathi, come. Arathi, get up. Get up. - Get her out of the Ashram, fast. Let's go fast. Come. Come now, Arathi. See this. Lord Bhairavan! Bhairavan... I heard some noise. Come... Devi... Devi! Devi! Devi... Devi! Devi, what happened? Devi! Devi! Oh no! - Devi! Devi...
