A Thirsty Life A Thirsty Life Yoko. Is that all your luggage? That's all you have after working a year in Nagoya? - Did you bring me the family register? - I did as you asked, Mom. Let's go straight to the town office. Excuse me. I need to register for a marriage. - For your daughter? - No, for me. Congratulations. Thank you. When are you getting married? You're the one getting married. I'm fine the way I am now. Why? By the way, I don't know your man. I'm not sure I will accept him. What are you saying? Don't start to be selfish. You know how kids are. Here you go. Don't get mad, Mom. I brought a gift. - What is it? - A wedding cake. Oh, really? Thank you! Are you really happy for me? I want you to be happy. Thank you. I think I've found 'Mr. Right' this time. He's even willing to marry me. He even owns his house. Isn't that just great? And he's willing to take you in, too. He's such a good man. He's good to me. He is my ticket to happiness. Can I go now? - We're done. - Thank you. You saw that clerk? He could be more cheerful. We weren't registering a funeral. It's a marriage. Well, people get married more easily nowadays. Mom. I hope you weren't lying. - You said you were running an inn? - Well, look around. This is it? I came back to Osaka to work in your inn. And I do run an inn. What did you expect? That I was running some fancy place? I see. You could have told me. Don't be stupid. Mother and daughter should support each other. You won't trick me. Is that him? Ah, hello. You look strong. He's a client. He's Sho-chan, he sells takoyaki. - My man is there already. - Where is he already? I have to be on stage tonight. I see. - You're still doing striptease? - That's right. You wouldn't know, but I still have the body of a 30 year old. People wouldn't believe I have such a big daughter as you. I'm disappointed in you. You keep falling for the same tricks. Your man is probably gone already. Say what you want. He's different from others. You know... ...I'm so happy we can live together again. I'll make you happy. Let's celebrate together. We'll eat the cake you brought. Okay? I shouldn't have come. But I just got back. I get it. You haven't stopped complaining, have you? Misses, this is my daughter. She'll be staying. She's been away in Nagoya, she's become cheeky. Daughters shouldn't stray from their parents. I asked her to let you keep the target practice shop. It won't be difficult to handle. Be nice to the clients. Don't get mad if they touch your boobs, got it? It will be just for a month. 5 shots: 20 yen No minors Watch out for him. He's a hooligan. Don't lay a hand on her or I'll kill you. I know how to take care of myself. I just got back and she's already disappearing. "5 shots = 20 yen." "No minors." But I am a minor. What is this? Are there any clients at all? You idiot! That's enough! - Is it good? - Yup! Show them more. Alright, I'll undress. - You sure it's alright? - Come on, give them a show. - What was that about? - Were you listening? She'll spice up the show. She's naked? It's her way of greeting them. We can't do that, how do you deal with the authorities? It they ever ask, we say she's undressing for her husband. You can't get away with that. Do that in your own club. It's just for the first time. They'll love it. What are you saying? Sir, thanks for earlier. It's nothing. I'll give you some special treatment after. What was that? You don't have permission to take photos. But we can settle that amiably. We can always negotiate something. You're ruining the show for the other clients. - There. - Hurry up. I'll take your camera. You'll come get it after. I'll do something nice for you. I'm serious. I'm a police officer. - Surely you're joking. - You've been caught in the act. Are you serious? I am. You are indeed. Hey guys, a cop is here. Hey, can you come? - What big company? - Sumitomo bank. So he went to university? Obviously, he did. And so you fell in love? Not just me. He loves me very much too. What kind of person is he? You're heavy. He's a great guy, obviously. You're just a working girl and your mom does striptease. Why would I believe you? I don't care what you think. Soon, we'll get married. Sure, enough talking now. Don't let him cheat on you. What are you saying? We have a pure relationship, like angels. Is that right? Good for you. But I won't give up so easily. Hey mister, how about a game? There are many gifts to win. - You're Yoko, right? - Yes. It's about your mom. I don't want to hear about her business. - What about Mom? - I came to tell you... ...she got arrested. - She got arrested? - Yes. Her bail is 50,000 yen. She's in custody. She needs you to get out. And to make it worse, Mr. Kuenz was arrested too. I don't have a dime. She's waiting there... ...so I came to ask you. You must have some savings for your mom. - Are you Mom's man? - I am. You have some nerve to ask me that. I don't have that kind of money. Come on, your mom's in jail. Don't you pity her? - I don't have that money. - She's your mom. She's your wife! Don't be so harsh, Yoko. Right? All that matters now... ...is to help your mom out. You need to be a good daughter. If you don't have money... I know! There's that Melo Cafe, in front of the station... ...you could work there for just a month? - Ask them to pay you in advance. - That's stupid. Where are employees paid 50,000 yen a month? I'll introduce you. Please, I'm asking you. It's for your mom. It'll be over quickly. Be a good daughter, alright? I'll pay you back double, triple. I beg you! You're supposed to be my step-father? It's me. Who are you? Ah, you're a client? No, who are you? Coming in uninvited. - Didn't the boss tell you? - The boss? You mean Kot-chan? You came to work here? You see, Kot-chan runs several shops around here. I see. He's your pimp, then. - What is that? - We'll ask him, he'll be back soon. If you're a guest, I can't help you. I'm busy. How would you know? I have been gone for a year. - I'm his wife. - What did you say? I see. Well, that's perfect. I am quite busy. You take care of the house. Yoko, thank you. I'm glad you bailed me out. I thought all you did was complain, but you're there when I need you. You make me so happy. - Go back home quickly. - Alright. Was everything fine? - Yes. - Yes. Alright then, thank you again. Thanks so much! I'm home. I thought so. I knew you'd do this to me. Why are you here? I thought you died long ago. Every summer, she goes crazy. Last summer, she went away and disappeared. Hey, it's too late to come back now. You're not welcome anymore. You get it? Don't mind her, she's crazy. I just had a fit of hysteria. I'm all better now. Please, take a seat. - You were quick to find another one. - Idiot! You're crazy, you don't understand anything. He's such a hopeless case. Twice a year, he looks for another woman. He can't be trusted. And now he wants to kick me out. It's really saddening. I could almost cry. - Kicking me out of my own house. - What? What did you just say? I own this house. - Is it true? - Don't act so surprised. We can settle this. Don't let this crazy woman have her way. The inn business is on my name. - Don't worry. - You told me you owned this house. - You said...! - Don't get mad. No need to. You're falling into her trap, okay? You need to stay calm. I have the inn business rights. Even if she takes me to court, I'm prepared. You get it? Right. I'm prepared for you! Oh, no... Again... I was fooled again. I just had a little check before rushing into this. Oh, no. I feel like I'm gonna die. - What happened? - I wish I was dead. I have no one left but you. What are you saying? You say that every time you break up with a man. You knew? Once you find a new one, you'll forget everything and run someplace. That's true. Your mom is such a bad person. No need to apologize. I don't trust you in the first place. Don't just stand there. Get in or get out. You know, you're the only one I love. You know that, right? No, no. Don't do that. Don't touch me. I love you. You're just saying that. Can I? No! Come on. I'm telling you, no. I love you. I love you. Sho-chan... Sho-chan... You're up, right? Sho-chan... Make love... ...to me. Sho-chan... I'm so happy... because... ...I've loved you for a long time. You have so many. There's a big one! - Look! - Huh? She told me to keep the target practice. You don't need to listen to her. It's not like I would. Behind the station, there's a tea shop. I'll work there. Will you come for a drink? Alright, I'll go. Take your shirt off. Don't move, I'll do it for you. Give me your back. - Like this? - Yes. When I see you like a big baby, I feel like taking care of you. It feels good for me too. Dear. This is weird. I don't see anything there. - My back? - Yeah. But I have a back. I'm talking about pimples. I never saw a weird guy like you. Is that so? Hey, face up. My face up? Let me clean your belly button. Why? Don't do that. - It brings bad luck. - That's a superstition. You need to clean it some times. Alright, alright. It's a bit strange, though. There. Say... What is it? Come on. How about it? - Not in midday. - Come on. At night. - You're a pervert. - You bet! I'm a real man. I need to kick her out soon. What? What are you looking at? Yoko's got a nice body. - She'd be successful. - What? What are you thinking about? She could make a lot of money. If you two teamed up... a show named "Mother and daughter." Isn't that a great idea? "Mother and daughter," that's filthy! I won't have Yoko work naked. I understand how you feel. Business requires sacrifices. Stop it. Yoko is my precious daughter. If you make her do that, I'll kill you. I'm not coming back. Mihama Hot Spring Why are the police so strict? Men always want to watch strip shows. And, as long as they do, there will be strip shows. You're so right. They are really too strict. Even the clients get fined... ...and some were arrested. It's bad for business. You don't get it. I've been telling you. Listen. They make a fuss at first, but that's just temporary. They don't have enough cops to check the clubs. That's true too. Until the law changes... ...we just have to be careful. If that's how they are, we just have to hold our ground. We won't give up. We get it, give us more. We got it, come on. Today you're not lucky. Why? You won't get any more than this. - But why? - Can't you guess? Are you shy? Idiot, that's not it. - Are there cops with us? - Really? Is that so? But we came here for a show. The police take away the people's fun. - It's him! - Yes. Are you a cop? You do look like one. There were really cops. Even the cops would have enjoyed it. What a pitiful job. - Me? - Come over here. I'll reward you for spotting them out. Is that so? Just a peek. Hey, what are you doing? You're all gonna get a show. Now that they're gone, we can start. Let the show begin. Okay! She's the second girl to the left. Like I said, she has a nice body. It would be a waste not to show her. - Look at the audience. - Hm? What? They're not saying a word. - That's true. - They're just staring. How dare she? Look at her. She dances in front of those guys, showing her belly... - ...and scorns my stripping. - Why are you so mad? I always treated Yoko well. I raised her with care. I told her I was a stripper and she always despised me for that. Since I started it, she stopped respecting me as a mother. She just hates her mom. The cabaret-theater will take you. Really? I'm so glad. Thank you! You'll have to work hard. - Thank you, Manager. - You can stop calling me Manager. I see you as a woman, you should see me as a man. Then what should I call you? You know what I mean? - What will you have? - Two glasses of water. I'm working hard for you. To be honest, I have a boyfriend. Who is he? You don't know him, Manager. - Not someone from the theater? - No. He's in Nagoya now. Nagoya? - Does he visit you sometimes? - Not lately, it's far. What does he do? He works for Sumitomo bank. You told him you dance half-naked? I can't tell him. You can't tell him, huh? Let's drop this topic. To love someone is to devote oneself to that person, right? I'll make you a top dancer. The cabaret is just the first step. You know that, right? What did that guy do for you? Yoko is a strange woman. She's a bit weird. - She's like the Virgin Mary. - What is that? She's a virgin even though she's with a man. - I feel sorry for the guy. - My feelings exactly. "I want to be like a flower."- She said it like that. - That Kyoyan can be heavy. - Ignore him. He's saying weird things about you to discourage Mr. Kura. I can't even touch her boobs with those big nipples of hers. "I want everyone to think I'm pretty."- She said the other day. - It seems you're all over her. - Certainly not! She doesn't even like sex. Maybe she doesn't like you. She'll fall for me soon enough. Yoko, wait. Mr. Kura is interested in you. - What kind of interest? - I just told him about you. Mr. Kura, what do you think? Yoko can become a great dancer. Can you do it? Say something. He could really help you. - Yes. - It's fine. It seems you get naked so naturally. - What does that mean? - Exactly what I said. Just today, I thought I'd quit. Why? But your compliment just gave my self-confidence back. Thank you very much. Yoko. You understand? This is what love is about. It is to do things for your lover, right? Do you understand? I'll be waiting for you. Kyoyan, you're ready? Ready for what? What? You invited me. I invited you? Sorry, I have a date with Yoko. Yoko invited me. She said you wanted us to go drink together. I didn't say that. - Wasn't she joking? - She said she'd be waiting in front. Let's go. Why did you lie to me? Did I lie? You told me Kyoyan was inviting. Why? You have a date with him? Shall we go? - Is Kyoyan following us? - Right, he is. About the cabaret. It's not a good choice. Why is that? She's better fit to work with me. - Sorry, but it's already decided. - Just look for another girl. I can't do that. I'll give you another girl, if you insist. What is that? Yoko can't work in such a place of low repute. Mr. Kura, that's unfair. What's the meaning of that? Otherwise, I can't make you my star. That's impossible. You're both deciding for me, without consulting me. That's right. You're the one who makes the decision. That won't be too hard. You asked me why I lied earlier. Yes... why? Because I wanted to talk with the two of you. What you asked me yesterday, Kyoyan. You insisted, but I can't do it. I'm flattered, but... Enough of this. What did he ask you yesterday? However hard you fight against a typhoon, you end up on your butt. She turned me down flat. He proposed to me. You rub my nose in it. You're humiliating me in front of Mr. Kura. I went to Osaka by myself. There's no one you can trust. I wanted to ask your advice, Director. I have learned so much from Kyoyan. I don't know what I'd do if Kyoyan hated me. - Director. - Oh, it's you. Have you heard the rumor? They say I dropped Kyoyan for you. - I heard it. - Kyoyan is at the origin of it. I don't know what I should do. I want you to help me. You're a kid, you shouldn't pull such tricks. Forgive me. But Kyoyan is really spreading that rumor. I just wanted to go with you, Director. I don't care what the rumor says. - I'm happy. - Hm. Mr. Kura. You're different from my mom's men. Why is that? You're a gentleman. You're nice. And you're an artist. The truth is... ...I didn't know. You were my first time. I was embarrassed. So I didn't raise my voice. Why not? Because I was afraid... ...I'd sound like my mom. Only one client, huh? So what? Hey, Mister. - Are you in the striptease business? - Yeah... You have such questions. When does it start? Right, I'll tell them. Hurry up. What's up? - Still just one client? - Yeah. - What's wrong? - Hm? Allow me. You're so stiff. I'll take you to a Hot Spring. You and me, it would be great. Dear. You're only nice to me at business hours. That's not true. Come on, we'll go for a drink. Okay? Drinking or going to the springs, it's all the same to you. Right? That's what you mean. It's fine. Let's go to that Hot Spring. Yoko is doing good. What is that? Look. She's a star! What stripper uses her real name? That's not considerate. Oh, right. She's using her real name. She's doing it with pride. Are you stupid? - There's no pride in our trade. - Don't be that critical. I had a letter from her. That means she's worried about you. She said she'd take me in if I broke up with you. That's foolish. You're the fool. That's enough. Forget about that. Hey...100,000 men. I haven't showed myself to 100,000 men yet. That's it. I'll do my show for 100,000 people. About the inn... ...the clients don't want your escort. I need to be honest with you. You're getting old. We'd rather work with younger women. Ah, Ms. Iyana, Mr. Kitaharuwa. - I saw your show earlier. - Thank you. Go over there. Or the cops will arrest you again. Ms. Shoko, won't you do their show? What show? Lap-dance. What do you think? Forgive me for being blunt... ...but you can't make a living just by showing a leg anymore. I can't keep my contract with you on just a strip-show. Look, either you accept or not... ...I really appreciate you. I'm offering you good money. I have a better plan. What is it? - I'm not telling you. - You should. I'm not sure you even have a plan. Even just on my own, I love doing striptease. That's how a trade works, right? You must enjoy it yourself first. Give it a try, give it a try. A grand prize for the winner. It's a special offer, only today. Sir, sir, won't you give it a try? With one shot, it's a sure win. Sir, sir, give it a try. Come on, try it. Sir, sir, try it! One shot is 200 yen. - That's expensive. - It isn't, at all! Look sir, just shoot that can down... ...at the inn over there and I'll dance nude for you. - Really? - For real, it's the special prize. I'm an experienced dancer, come on. - Try it. - I'll try. Okay! - Thank you. - Thank you. Ah, what a pity! - One more. - Only one shot. Why? It's one shot per person, let's be fair. Sir, could you call over your friends? If one of them wins, you'll all get the prize. - For real? - For real! - You're not lying? - I promise. - Really, really. - I'll be waiting, sir. Amazing! Ms. Yoko! Your dance was spectacular! Thank you. I'm your fan. That's disgusting. Don't follow me. I'll call the police. Wait, I'm not a weirdo. Are you stupid? Mr. Officer. Her mom, Shoko, is staying at my place. I heard Yoko was her daughter. And that she was a star, so I went to see her show. I wanted to go right after the show, but she danced so well... ...I couldn't help but admire her. I just told her she was amazing... ...but she called a police officer. I told her I'm not a weirdo, but she called him anyway. She didn't have to call a cop. I didn't do anything wrong. And so I got mad. But I didn't shove her. - Why don't you just admit it? - It's the truth. I was upset, but I didn't shove her. You were so upset that you wanted to kill her. No. I admire her, I'd never do that. She tripped on a stone. She's punished for leaving her mom. You must be Ms. Yoko. I met your mom on the way here. I asked her to come for a talk, but she doesn't want to meet you. If she doesn't want to meet me, that's fine. Why? Who knows? If I didn't know her, I'd feel sorry for her. I'm... I'm actually glad this happened to me. - Why? - I get free PR from this. Two or three papers will write about you this week. What kind of article? A murder case article. "Why did a girl want to kill a stripper?" Thank you. Luck is coming my way. Write as much as you like. I'd like to request something. When I was in a club in Nagoya... ...there was a man I liked. Though he was a yakuza. But, suddenly, he stopped coming. Later, I heard he'd been arrested. But I made him a promise... ...if he changed, I'd marry him. I had lovers after him... ...but he's the only one I truly loved. If he could turn his life around, I want to keep my promise. I want you to write about that. Maybe he'll read the article. Please. I'm still in love with him. I want him to know. That's a beautiful story. - Will you write it for me? - But you made it all up, right? What are you saying? - It's true. - No way. My experience taught me to spot a lie. You're right, I lied about him. I told everyone... ...that he'd been to university and works for Sumitomo bank. But that's just because, little by little, I idealized him. It's just as you say. Can you understand he's my first love? You're an obstinate woman. Will you write it for me? Yes. Thank you. Do you want to become an actress? I'll promote you. The truth is... ...I'm a bit tired of dancing. I can't forbid you to do it. You're such an impetuous woman. I'm sorry. You never apologized before. Bye, then. I'll tell you something as a parting gift. Don't get fooled by that man. He's bad news for you. I'll be fine. I'll be there for you if you need me. Okay. Even dressed in rags, the beauty of the heart... ... shines more than any flower. Seize your youth, it comes only once. Because a real man... ...must dare where others hesitate. She's excited when men watch her. Like she is in love with each man watching her, feverish. From behind her sunglasses, she peeks at each man... ...whose insistent gazes excite her. That's how she gets high. Your mother, who lived off of sex... ... doesn't arouse men's desire anymore. She's doing it for herself now. When you're done, go see her. - Did you enjoy yourself? - It just felt awkward. Is that so? Although I did my best. But I have so much fun doing it. You must be kidding. What makes you say that? Are you serious? If I wasn't, I'd stop. I do it because it feels good. Can I go now? Bye. I'll open a beauty salon soon. Please, tell that to Yoko. She's lying. She can't open a beauty salon. Then why did she say that? Turn around. But you wanted to meet her. I don't want to know. I'll just pretend she didn't lie about her beauty salon. Allow me. Allow me. I can't do it. You'll just catch a cold. Where are you going? You need to dry up. When you're dry, we'll have lunch. Get out. I can't go on my own. Won't you marry me? You're actually serious? I'm serious. Yoko Kimura, do you vow to take Koji Sakamoto as your husband? Yes, I do. - I love you. - Right. For real. I get it. What about you? - The same. - It sounds like you don't care, though. I do love you. - Hello! - Oh, hey. I'm sorry about last time. - You came to apologize? - No. I didn't know you were here. I came to meet with Mr. Sakamoto. Did you want her to celebrate with us? Celebrate what? We just got married. Why did you invite her now of all times? I'm going to promote you both. The director will come soon. - So it's decided already? - He won't go against my decision. Then it's as good as settled? Mrs. Yoko, I won't try to seduce your man. You don't have to worry. As an apology for what I did... ...I'll always be on your side, and keep an eye on him. - Dear. - Eh? All the help you offered till now, I thought was especially for me. - Hey. - Hey. Have a seat. Is that her? - She looks good. - This is the director. - Hi. - Hi. Yoko has grown an attitude. Can you manage her? I'm making a fresh start. Now I'll do the things I like. Alright, the projection is starting. I'll become a free woman. Today, it's decided. I'm leaving this man, Yukichi Miura. Yukichi has no money, no talent. He was fired for public funds embezzlement. A sad excuse for a man. I'm making a fresh start. Now I'll do the things I like. I want to feel alive with my body. What else is there? There's one more reason why I became a free woman. This is the man who fired Yukichi. No! You fired my Yukichi. Because of you, I have to sell my body. Yoko, please forgive me, alright? "Man Golf." "Columbia TV Stereo National." "Corned Beef." "Ton Tech." "Hankyu Hotel." I can't draw the line between the real me and my acting. It's really strange. You're a natural actress. I'm so glad I became an actress. I've never been so happy. My acting back there was as good as any actress's. That girl will be co-acting with you. That was decided from the start, right? Hello, it's Sakamoto. About that script... Compared to me, she's a cheap actress. You're promoting her, right? Yes, thank you. "Some people probably remember the incident six months ago..." "...where a young girl admiring a stripper..." "...pushed her into the incoming traffic in an attempt..." "...to kill her." "That was a sensational incident." Just so you know... ...I won't be co-acting with her. You'll do what I tell you to. I bought this apartment for you. Stop complaining and start earning. Sorry, I was talking to someone else. I'll proceed. "Yoko Kimura opened her arms to the young girl." No means no, mark my word. "That young girl is coincidentally related to her mother." "Coincidentally... related." Yes, that's it. "That is, Yoko and the young girl are distant cousins." "They have decided to co-act because..." Quote. "I like the story of the movie". End quote. "That's what she told me." "In the movie, Yoko will rape the young girl." "A story about a lesbian relationship." "Yoko says she will actually rape the young girl for the camera." That's stupid. No one will believe that. "And that will be the payback for what she did to me." "Incidentally, Yoko's mother is engaged in a disreputable business." "This difficult scene, thanks to Yoko's performance..." "...will be a worthwhile climax, for sure." "For sure", yes. That's all, thank you. Don't be childish. You'll have to tag along. It's already on the billboards in Tokyo. Use your intelligence. Just follow my lead. Go eat outside. I see. Shall we eat together? Just go alone! Why won't you cook for me? Spare me the smarmy act. It's just business. You'll thank me later. Hello! - Furniture delivery. - Ah, come in. Shall we put these here? Is it alright here? - Thank you! - Thank you! Good job. I gave it a good thought. I'm very successful. I like this apartment. This new sofa is great. I like the curtains too. I'll do it tomorrow. That's right. Everyone's doing good. - We'll become even happier. - Don't touch me. Don't get me wrong. I've got a great potential. You want a new deal? - What deal? - About that girl. You see. I'm an actress in movies now. Not only that, you're the star. In erotic movies. It's just a detail. It will be better this time. - Better in what way? - Can't you guess? It involves nakedness. You see. I like this apartment and I like this life. The only problem is... ...that you're in them. What do you mean? You don't get it, do you? I... ...loathe you. Is that right? And who pays for your pretty life? You certainly don't. Just face the facts. - You're just my pimp. - You don't get it at all. I pulled the strings for you to get here. To all residents of Sekime, we are here this week. For a comfortable night, we are your bedding professionals. We can clean and purify your futon in just 30 minutes. For a fully regenerating night, your futon will be as good as new... ... with a powerful infrared-ray system. Don't hesitate to try it out. - You want to get in? - Interesting service. Is it your own business? Yes. How did you get the idea? We wanted to do something with a friend. A while back, at Tenoji park, a pervert sneaked into the lady's toilet... ...with a camera. He sold his film for gold... ...and we played it with friends. When we came back, I had the idea to start this business. This guy had this great idea. That's how you're successful. It's hot in here! Isn't it hot? I'm taking this off. I'm drenched in sweat. Don't crease your nice dress. You should take it off. Does your business work? Yes. I just started, but... - ...I have free advertising. - Hm? Mr. Sakurai. I know him. I do his futons for free. And he advertises for my business in this street. My clients are increasing. Come on, take it off. Don't be shy. - I'm not being shy. - That's not clean. You see, I know you. How come? I saw you in a movie. Is that so? You only watch weird films. Don't say that. Come on, it was great! That scene in the taxi. What was interesting? - I'd say... - The sex scenes? Don't say that! I'm telling you I liked it. Even though I try to be a real actress... ...the viewers just want me naked. Your acting is good. Thank you. That's enough. Let me out. I'm praising you and you get mad? I figured you'd be fun. When I saw you, I felt I was in a movie with you. Take your dress off and dry yourself. You're drenched in sweat. Most men in Japan want to sleep with you. Are you gonna get mad at them all? You're thinking too much about it. People fantasize about getting rich, but that's just a dream. You should do it naturally. Before Polaroid cameras, people were shooting a flash, a snap. They had to wait a week to get their photos. Now the photo comes out right away. It's a fantastic business. We could make money. A sure win. That sounds great. Let's do that together. There's one thing I fantasize about. What is it? I want to kill a man. Who is he? - My husband. - Why is that? I'd feel so free if he died. The happiest woman in Japan. Killing is never a smart move. Just break up with him. If you ever do that, I'll be there for you. I'd have him drink until he falls. Would you do it? It sounds easy like that. Otherwise you can't take him. He said he was a 3rd dan karate. I'd come from behind with a bat. - How about that? - Can you do it? Will you become mine if I do? I don't know if I can trust you. We're in the same boat. How do I know if I can trust you? If I promised to be yours, would you do it? Try me. Alright, then. Should I call him now? I'll tell you frankly, I don't want to see him anymore. I can't stand his face. How about you go up there and kill him? What will you do? I'll be waiting here. Here's the key. Which apartment is it? Just next door. Should I strangle him in his sleep? What time does he sleep? Around 1-2 AM. There's two hours left. I... I'll go to my friends place. Why is that? I'd better have an alibi. What about me? If I don't talk... ...they would never guess... ...that we know each other. I'll be the first they suspect. You'll do it, right? The building next door... ...apartment number 570. If I roam around for two hours, it won't make sense anymore. I'll be your alibi. We'll just say we were together. So I'll have an alibi too. You're in this with me! Are you... ...being serious? This is becoming real. You talk too much. You'll assist me to the end. We do it like that. You have to get your hands dirty too. Are you scared? Earlier... ...you said it wouldn't make sense. But isn't that even more ridiculous? Does he deserve to die? I got it. Do you know what you want? I got it. You can't do anything anyway. You hate him and you want him dead. But you can't act on it. Money, the status of a star... ...they're just fantasies. If you're gonna do it, then... I'm fed up. Let's stop this game. You can't kill him anyway. I'm going. I have to train for my race. The Grand Prix car race is coming up soon. Let's go together. What do you say? I'll give you a ride. That will be a thrill. What happened? I want to kill you. What the heck? You're drunk too. How do you take off your panties without taking off your pantyhose? I don't know. To everyone in Amagami, the Four Pink Movie Stars... ...Yoko Kimura, Keiko Hono, Masako Kazama... ...and Yukie Tsubaki are here. Per forming in "The Red Rose," "Passion and Virtue.".. ."..The pearls of the Nunnery" and "The Abashiri Jailbreak." Ah, I'm so hungry. - Make me some kitsune udon. - Alright. And some gyoza. Got it. You came all the way? What brings you here? An interesting encounter. Wait until you hear this. - Until I hear what? - Someone wants to meet you. Who's that? You'll see him. He's waiting downstairs. He might be important to you. Don't forget I'm there. I'm valuable to you. It's me! Don't you remember? It's me. Oh, it's you, really. - I remember. - I'm glad. I knew you'd remember me. What's up? I read the article. I see. I thought about it and I finally quit everything. I wanted to meet you. Like that article said. I was arrested by the police. When I got out, you had left. That made me so sad. But this article was good news. What are you doing now? Like you asked in the article, I left the yakuza life. That's good. But you're getting the wrong idea. The wrong idea? That article wasn't about you. But when we worked at Lulu...! I've worked in other places, too. You said we'd get married if I quit! It was in that article. I even went to Hirokoji. Now, I'm married with the man who wrote that article. You understand, right? I know it's tough, but I'm sorry. - I see. - I'm sorry. It was all empty talk. I arranged everything for us to be together. I see that you came all the way here to see me... ...so if you need money, I could lend you some. Since we were so close. We're friends, now? You're a star, I'm just a small time thug. We live in different worlds. - But I so missed you. - You're being clutchy now. The article wasn't about you. It was about another man! I trusted you. I believed the article like an idiot and I rushed to meet you. Too bad for me. I can't go back to Nagoya like this. You made me lose face! I have to get even. A bit of success went to your head. You despise me. If I die... ...my money... ...there's a car racer named Ito... ...I want him to have it all. I saved up about 500,000 yen. Tell him it's for his dream. I wish him to win the Grand Prix. That's my will. You're not dying. You were stabbed in the leg. You'll be fine. Are you serious? You're not lying? I thought I was done. That's beautiful. Luck is coming my way again. - Mommy, I'm scared. - Get back! If you come, I'll stab her! Mommy! Mommy! Back off! It's him again. What a scoop! You're really lucky. I think he was shot! Is he dead? Shit. Is he alright? Yes. Just a light wound. This is fate again. Once you're out of jail... ...wouldn't you work with me? I saved about 500,000 yen. You've been a bartender, right? Let's open a bar. To be honest, I used to like you a lot. We'll have a new start, erase the past. I want to play in many movies. I'll come to the bar sometimes. We'll split the earnings 60/40. Think about it.
