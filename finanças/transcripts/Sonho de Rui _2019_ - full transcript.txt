THE BEST THEATER GIANFRANCESCO GUARNIERI Getting out of here. Getting out of here. DREAMING OF BRADDOCK -Good morning. -Hi. -You were scheduled for 10 a.m., right? -Yes. Please come in. Wow! What a marvelous view! Bruno, right? Sorry for being late, Mr. Rui. It's Rui, no mister. Japanese? -What? -Nomiste. Is it a Japanese surname? It's Rui without “mister”. Nothing else. Just kidding! Can you imagine a red-haired Japanese man? There is not. Imagine a samurai or a fighter with red hair. -What? -Chuck Norris. He started by dominating Tang Soo Do. He was a karate champion for six consecutive years. He was the first westerner man to receive the eighth dan in taekwondo, he is a grandmaster. And he created his own style, Chun Kuk Do. Chuck. Redhead. Did he have his hair colored? It's a joke, man. Relax! I know Chuck Norris, he is the guy from the jokes! "When Chuck Norris does a push-up, he isn't lifting himself up, he is pushing Earth down!" You're going to like this one: "If that apple had fallen on Chuck Norris's head, there would be no Law of Gravity!" That one is very funny. Don't you like jokes? I do. I really do. But Chuck Norris is not the guy from the jokes. -Really? -Chuck Norris is a fighter. He's a fighter and an actor. He is doubly an artist, for he has mastered the performing arts and the martial arts. Here is the living room. You've seen it, right? I'll show you the other rooms. Rui, what is behind that locked door? So, as you can see, here is the office. Office? There are is no computer or printer! I don't need computers or printers. I'm an actor. Actor and party entertainer. Entertainer? You don't sound cheerful. Don't you think this is a wonderful apartment? Large, with parking facilities, a sea facing balcony and no view of the poor community! Practically unoccupied! The resident is the owner himself, he leaves as soon as the deal is closed! Sign in and live! Shall we see the kitchen now? Did you like the place? When can we talk again? I liked it but... I have to talk to my wife... -We are not fond of... -Of what? -Ready... -Red? -No! -You meant red-haired? -It was “ready or not...” -Ready or not what? Ready or not, I'll try to get a letter of credit. It's not the best for me, but maybe... Wait a minute, what you and your wife don't like? We don't like living near the beach. Things get rusty. -Rusty? -The sea air rusts metal. Things get kind of red. We have nothing against red or orange tones. We love them. But apartments near the beach are more expansive. We don't usually go to the beach. So why pay more? To get things rusty? But you already knew it was near the beach. Now you talk about rust. Did you see anything here that reminds you of rust? I'm going to talk to my wife. I'm not giving up yet. I call you later, ok? Good bye. “Pushing Earth down”. What a fool. “There would be no Law of Gravity”. Moron. Hi, Cintia! What? Are you speaking Portuguese? -Hi Cintia, come on please. -Ah! Why don't you tell us... Why... No, please. Why there was a price on my head? You must say it together. "Why don't you tell us why there was a price on my head?" Try it! Why don't you tell us... why... why there... was a... was a price on my head? Can I answer it? It's my American friend! -I have to talk about my journey! -Of course. Hi Anne, what's up? Come again? Why? But... but I was counting on it. No... fuck... No! I'm just surprised. Why is a price on my head? Look, I can't talk right now, ok? I'm in the middle of a lesson. I'll call you, I'll call you, ok? Don't decide anything else, ok? Please! Ok... bye... Fuck! Problems? One month to my trip and my friend in Los Angeles is backing off! She decided renting the room for another girl, a gringa. Just because the girl has a job and can split expanses! How sad! It's going to break me! I was packing all my belongings to leave my place! I am really experiencing my astral hell! If I can help in any way... We're in the middle of the lesson, right? Let's go. Back to work! Say the line again! Why don't you tell us why there was a price on my head? Perfect! Your pronunciation is great! -You're so talented! -Really? For someone who has been studying for three months, it's superb! Is it good for a student or is it good for the movie? It's good for a Brazilian actor in a movie. It's just good enough for a Brazilian actor... Oh my... Look, it was just a bad choice of words. It's really good. How cute! You blush! When I blush I look like a cock. What? No! I'm sorry! I mean a rooster with red feathers in the head! I didn't want you to think about that thing... It's OK! I didn't think about that! I didn't visualize your thing. But now that I mentioned it, I think I have just visualized your... So, you better think about other thing! About a... dead cat! What? Think about a white cat which was hit in the head by a stone! How awful! But the head of this cat would be red like a cock head. You're right. Oh, it's time to go! The lesson is over, isn't it? Oh, yes it is. -So, it's “bye”. -Yes, bye. Time flies when we are having fun. Yes, but you were not having fun, you were working. Who said I can't have fun while working? Yes, sure. Guess what? I'd like to know if I have visualized your thing just like it is. Antonio Pedro at my door on a Sunday morning? Shouldn't you be at the beach? How can I be at the beach, Rui? Come in. You should be the one at the beach, working out. Under that horrible sun? Did you find a buyer for this apartment? More or less. The crew is giving up the project! Our General Trau has already taken another job. I need the money to find locations, casting, trailers, special effects, stuntmen and everything! There will be no stuntmen, Sfiha! I don't care about stuntmen! I can't keep the actors involved. I was not supposed to deal with all this production manager shit! Actually, I should have a hot production manager to have an affair with. But no, I've to do all the dirty job. You're not getting that you will earn more as a director and a production manager. Earn what? What's the currency in your dreams? For nothing is real yet, love. It's been six months since your father died, -and you can't sell this place! -Sfiha! I'm sorry. I mentioned your father's death, right? No, you're talking about work outside the office. Prick! OK, Mister OCD. Let´s go to the fucking office. Just in time. Come with me. I'm feeling you want to quit the job. Get up! I could expect it from that bastard, General Trau -His name is Alfredo. -I could expect it from Alfredo. But you're my friend. You know how it's important to me. My father had do die so that I had the chance to make my dream come true. The dream of quitting supporting roles in TV series that nobody watches. Rui... The dream of stop working in birthday parties, standing spoiled kids shouting. Take it easy. The dream of shooting the remake of Chuck Norris' “Missing in Action”. Gosh! When you say it loud I notice that I am in a bust. You're not in a bust! I invited you because it's going to be good for you too. Your name is going to be synonym of boldness, audacity. There will be no Padilha, no Meireles. Hollywood will call only Sfiha! Antonio Pedro Sfiha! You're going to direct Netflix productions! They won't need to ask if you can direct in English. I would like to talk about it too. The idea of shooting this movie in English... Shouldn't you change your mind? It's a historical movie! When Mel Gibson shoot his film about Jesus in Aramaic, they said he was crazy. And it was a hit! Jesus doesn't speak English! Chuck Norris doesn't speak Portuguese! Are you comparing Jesus to Chuck Norris? Why not? This reminded of a joke. When God said “Let there be light”, Chuck Norris told him “Say please”. Never mind, I didn't get this joke. Anyway, I don't get why people don't want to buy this place! Are there any cockroaches, rats or ghosts? I don't get it neither! Are you being pleasant to the visitors? Yes... I'm very pleasant to people. Rui, you have to act, to sound nice to people. I don't need to act to sound pleasant. OK... So why nobody buys this place? Every millionaire would like to live here! I don't know! The last moron who came here just make jokes about Chuck Norris. I don't know why. I think he had a problem with me. What do you mean? Never mind. Did he criticized you or the apartment? He said that this place is going to rust. I think he said it to make a joke about me. What kind of joke? A red-haired joke. There's no such thing. There are jokes about gays, foreigners and other minorities. You don't know how it feels like being a red-haired in Brazil. Your hair is like a beet! I'm not a beet, I'm Rui. You're Betty Beet! To hell with Betty! I'm Rui. Betty is angry! Calm down, Betty! His hair is all red! Betty! My name isn't Betty! It's Rui! Betty is red angry! Calm down, Betty! Betty! Betty! Betty! Betty Beet! Get out of here, Beet! Betty Beet! Betty Beet! Betty Beet! Betty Beet! Betty Beet! Betty Beet! Betty! Betty! Betty! My name isn't Betty! It's Rui! Betty is angry! I'm sorry, I can't date someone called Betty. I even like you. But I can't have a boyfriend called Betty. No way. Any news, Sandra? I’m the one who asks! Did you sell this place? Please, come in. Rui, if you don’t get the money, I can’t buy the rights to the remake. It’s three weeks to go until the deadline they set! Sandra, we’re in the living room. I know. And I am living. But the office is the place to talk about work, please. Please don’t! Office. Talk about work. Please continue. Your father was very upset about these OCD things. He must have been sad in Heaven when you said in the funeral that there wouldn’t be a burial. If someone puts your body inside a drawer, he is not burying the ground at all. So I could not call that a burial. Technically, you could. Burial is the name of ceremony too. They call it a burial drawer. So, your father is buried. Can we talk about the movie? Thank you. Sandra, are you hiding something? Why did the Americans set a deadline to sell the rights? Is there anyone else interested in it? I don’t know. Maybe. But it can be just a strategy. I don't know, Rui. It’s not my legal specialty. I just took your case in consideration of your father. Hollywood is saturated. There’s no more creativity there. Surely there’s someone else planning to bring Braddock back. Damn! Can’t I be the only one to have this bright idea? Please! Hi! You must be Jose, right? Yes! I am here to see the apartment. Please come in. My place is your place. I mean, it will be soon! Thank you! I won’t take too long. I have an appointment. Always jogging, right Jose? Jogging? By the way you are dressed, I suppose you were jogging! When you move here, you can jog near the beach. -I was not jogging. -Really? I came to Rio to see my daughter in a honors ceremony. She told me to dress in “formal wear”. I look in good form dressing this. Let’s see the apartment? It’s pretty. Let’s jog around! I’m joking! Come along! There’s a second living room here. There’s a bathroom here. And here is the kitchen. Sorry about the mess. I was preparing my lunch. Just noodles and sausage, but it’s OK. Single men can’t cook. But I'm pretty good making ice cubes! Do you want to join me? No, thanks. There will be food in the ceremony. It’s at the Riviori. The Riviori? Very fancy! You can see more cutlery on a table than in my whole kitchen. -Fancy? -Very fancy. I can’t understand all these big city things... Don’t you really want to taste it? You know, I don’t eat sausage. -Don’t you? -Not at all. It’s junk food. It doesn’t even get close to my farm. I read somewhere that if people knew how sausage are made, nobody would buy them. They even put newspaper in it. -Is there newspaper in it? -They mix a lot of things. I like sausage. It’s a pity you won’t eat with me. Just take a look at the water! Look at this color! How horrible! What’s the matter with sausage water? The color! Look, Jose. Isn’t it time to go to your daughter’s ceremony? What? Oh! Yes, it is! OK, we can go. I still have to think about this apartment. It would be a present for my daughter. -Actually, I feel I little insecure... -Why? I’m a bit annoyed about rust. Rust? Where? Where? Haven’t you looked at the mirror, son? Jose! Aren’t you ashamed of... Thanks. Get out of here, please! -What? Are you kicking me out? -Yes, I am! Go to The Riviori -with this formal wear! -You're so impolite! You’ll never be formal. -You’re a monster! Get out of here! -Go to hell. Rude! Rude wear! Bruno? Hi! It's Rui. The owner of the apartment. How are you? Hi, Rui. I’m fine. A visitor has just left my apartment and he’s very interested in it. But I’d prefer to sell it to you. Oh! Thanks for you kindness, Rui. But right now I can’t afford it. Can’t you? Why? My business isn't going well. The financial report is out. We’re in the red. In the red? Yes, I’m in trouble. I can’t buy your apartment while I’m in the red. Hi. Have anyone here ordered a stallion? Come in. Take off the shirt. I want to see your body. Come on, show me what you’ve got. Take it all off. Yeah. Take it all off. Spin around. Let me see. You’re great! Am I not the best personal trainer you know? You’re huge! But I don’t have a body like Chuck Norris yet. A body like Chuck Norris? Chuck Norris' pulse-rate is measured on the Richter Scale. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Chuck Norris has 72... and they're all poisonous. You really don’t like Chuck Norris jokes. Do you want to get something off your chest? I know psychology too. Sane mind in a sane body. We can get out to drink a whey protein shake and talk. I can’t sell my apartment. I think I am the problem. Nonsense! Who could have any problem with you? Diogo, do you think I am weird? Weird? What do you mean? Redheaded. Come on, warrior! Everybody loves redheaded people. Marina Rui Barbosa! Emma Stone! Jessica Rabbit! Lindsey Lohan... Is Lindsay Lohan dead? No, she’s alive. Until this morning I’m sure she was. -She is killer. -Sharing drugs? No, dude! I mean she’s hot. Everybody loves the redheaded ones. Only the redheaded women. It’s hard to be a redheaded boy. I’ve been through a lot. Nicknames! Fanta burp, tampon top, Cheeto head, holiday... -Holiday? -It’s red on the calendar. -Smart one. -To hell! I can never sunbathe. You don’t know how it feels to be a kid who can’t get tanned in Rio. It’s social suicide. Was it hard to get a girl too? -It is. -It is? Or it was? It was. I don’t talk about my romantic life. What about your sexual life? Spanking the red monkey is all you’ve got? Sorry. I see you got rusty. I think you must always physically improve yourself. If you’re fat, you have to work out. Too fat, bariatric surgery. If you’re going bald, shave off. But only if you’re strong. And you’re strong. -Are you suggesting I shave off? -I’m not. I did not suggest anything. I’m just saying that if you don’t like what you see in the mirror, you can change it. People have to feel happy inside their bodies. It’s good for your mind, for your soul. Come on! Cheer up! -Hi, Rui. -Hi, Cintia! I mean... -Hi, Cintia. -Hi, how are you? I'm fine, thanks. What's your favorite color? My favorite color is red. Are you letting me in? What? Won't you let come in? I understood your English. I’m just surprised about your request. You may come in. I'm sorry about the mess! I was not expecting anyone. For someone born under the Sagittarius, it’s not a mess at all. I wanted to give you a surprise. Oh, sorry! I chose the wrong time to visit you! Why? You're watching porn, don't you? No! It’s not what it seems. It’s Chuck Norris! I see! Wait a minute. Do you sleep in the living room? -I do. -But there’s a bed in your office! Yes, but it’s not my bed. It was my father’s bed. You never talk about him. -Do you have any daddy issues? -No, not at all. He was the one who had issues with me. We didn’t talk to each other since I left home to become an actor. You left this place to become an actor! You’re crazy. Look, Cintia. Shall we go to the office? There’s no need. I’m fine here. I see... but English lessons are business. Business take place on the office. Who said I came here to work? I came to see how you’re doing. Oh... That's fine. So, please take a sit. Sit down, please. I’m fine. And you? How are you? I was hanging around when I thought about you. Why? Never mind. Tell me! -I saw a dead cat. -What? Do you remember you told me to think about a dead cat, so that I didn’t visualize that other thing you mentioned? Oh, yes. Do you remember I told you I was curious about that thing? They say curiosity killed the cat. Or the pussycat. Maybe I’m a killer, like my personal trainer says. I got it! -Weird expression, right? -Really? Yes. But it’s the thought that counts. So, you’re on the smartphone. I’m telling a friend where I am. Bad news spread faster. What do you mean? If you are already talking to others, you didn’t like what we did. Come on, I enjoyed it. You must enjoy the after sex too. A woman on the phone after sex is like a man turning around to sleep. Only for your generation. For me it's very normal. Smartphone is part of my life. -Let’s take nudes! -No! Let’s show the carpet matches the drapes! That’s a very sexist joke. You silly! What are you snapping? I’m taking photos of your place to send to my friend. No! I can give you the link of the ad. It's better. What is that first room? It’s a locked bedroom. Does your friend want to buy my apartment? Of course not! She can’t afford it. I know no one who can. I just love your place. I could live here. It’s time to go, tiger. Don’t you want to sleep over? You've just said you could live here. Living is not sleeping. Sleeping is not living. The party is out there! Don't you want company? Better not. Don't bother yourself. I’m going to meet some girlfriends. Get there with a guy would be awkward. You're ashamed of me, aren't you? Shame? Have you ever seen my face turning to red? I’m confident, tiger. Bye! Bye! Oh... Rui? -Yes. -I’m Ivo. -How are you? -I’m fine. -I came to see the apartment. -Come in. Excuse me. -A huge one! -Yeah. -How many bedrooms? -Four bedrooms. High property taxes? -It depends. -What a view! -May I? -Please. Is it noisy? No, soundproofed. Is it you? Are you serious? -Chuck Norris, right? -Right. I respect him. But I prefer Arnold. -Really? -Schwarzenegger? He left Austria and went to America as a bodybuilder. He said “I’m going to win here”. He became a Hollywood actor, starred action movies and comedies. He was a hit. Then he decided to become a politician and was elected California governor! His administration was considered one of the most progressive in History. Arnold! If you allow me, I disagree. It was easy for Schwarzenegger to win in America. He was a pile of muscles, perfect for a nation which considers itself the most powerful on Earth. In the movies, he just used weapons. He couldn’t fight, he had no techniques. And it’s easy for a celebrity to be elected in the USA. They elected Reagan, who was an actor, for president. And then there was Trump, who came from TV. Schwarzenegger was just a governor in a state where Hollywood is situated. No big deal. So you think Chuck Norris is better? Chuck is his own words: “I was just a shy kid who never excelled at anything in school”. But this boy grew up, became a master, a karate teacher, won numerous tournaments, moved to cinema and was a winner there too. He defeated movie critics also. Then he moved to TV, had his own series and also became a writer. Was he successful writing? Success? His autobiography was a best-seller. He wrote many books, he had many sons and probably planted many trees. A whole man. He conquered two ladies. Just think about this. Two hearts! And he did it all as a red-haired man. He is all a red-haired person can be. We can’t be more than Norris, but we can be like him. We can be a remake. I’ve never thought about what he symbolizes for us. -Us meaning who? -Us. The redheaded ones? The headed ones! You’re red-haired! I’m bald! But your hair was red! Your beard is! Are you going to defend the pirate Redbeard? Redbeard is not a shame for us. You don’t need to feel ashamed. You betrayed the redheaded people. I’m here to buy the apartment, not to talk about my personal life. But I won’t sell the apartment for a traitor. I don’t want a Judas using my bathroom. I was really about to buy this shit! But you are crazy! -What’s on your head? -I'm not crazy. -I know what’s on my head. -Go to hell! -What about you? -Just shut up! I know who I am, who I want to be! You know what? I prefer Steven Seagal! Why don't. Why don't to tell us. Why don't to tell us. Why don't to tell us. Why don't... Antonio Pedro at my door on a Sunday morning? Shouldn’t you be at the beach? Déjà-vu. -It’s a glitch in the Matrix! -The Matrix. A movie with a red-haired villain. -He’s not a red-haired actor! -He’s a wannabe. And he’s a red-headed villain in the Captain America movie. Red Skull? He’s not red-haired. He's bald! Should it be? His head was all red! Symbolism for red-haired. An evil one. -Can I come in? -Sit there. No, let’s go to the office. -Work? -Real work this time. Come on. What’s going on? You’re really weird today. You’re really weird in this incarnation. I’m serious because it’s a serious talk. Go ahead. I was asked about directing a TV series. -Where? -All I know it’s for cable TV. A comedy show. A comedy show for cable TV? Popular humor, for the lower classes. Sfiha, this is what you’re running from! This is what I am running from! This is what is bringing us down! I was going to invite you. Lead role? They already hired a famous comedian for the lead role. But there’s a good supporting role. You can play the clown. Play the clown? Playing the role of a clown is different. When it’s an actor playing a clown it’s better than working as a clown. It’s not like being hired as a clown for a party. You just play the clown... Play the clown! I don’t know! I need the money. If they make an official offer, I can pay you with real money. What about Braddock? Braddock is fine. He’s not broke. He does not owe the rent. Also because Chuck Norris doesn’t pay rent. He just choses a place, says “get out” and people move out. It’s not time for silly jokes about Chuck! Are you’re quitting the job? Answer the call! It can be a buyer! Hello? Hi, Cintia! How are you? I’m in a meeting. In the office. When I leave I call you. OK. Kisses. Sorry. Kisses, kisses. Talking in English! With a girl! I’ve never seen it. It’s Cintia. The teacher I hired for the movie. Which I don’t know if I’m going to make, since my director is quitting the job! There’s no job since you never hired me at all! If you show me the money and a contract, maybe I’ll direct the movie. -I’ll chuckle Norris! -Sfiha! Hey, you’re so different when you talk to a girl! -Really? -You stop being weird. You are softer, relaxed. Even prettier. I really liked it! I don’t like saying this, but I think you need a woman. I’ve got to go. I have tons of things to do! Listen to me, please. Just sell this apartment. Otherwise I’ll sign with the TV company and take you with me. I know all you eat is noodles and sausage. You’re going to faint when you exercise. And talking about physical effort, call your teacher! It’s my advice. Here I go! Open the door or I won’t come back. -Who is the one with OCD now? -It’s not a disorder. It’s a belief. Beliefs are ignorance. I prefer being ignorant than crazy as a woodpecker. Knock on wood! I think you're crazy I think you're crazy Call the teacher, don't forget! -Hi, Cintia! -Look at you... Video calling! Why? Because I wanted to see you. Somebody is falling in love. Don’t turn red! I’m not red... Do you intend to talk about work now? No, unless you want to. No! Anything but work now. I’m in the office. Can you wait till I arrive at the living room? I’m in the living room. What’s up? You look a little worried. It's just... the director of my movie... He's about to work on a cable TV comedy. And he wants me to join to play the clown. Don’t say that! Working for cable TV is not playing the clown. -No, just...-Maybe it’s the best for you right now. You can quit the idea of selling the apartment. You can invest in your career and earn money to make your movie later. No need to sell the place. Later? When? Do you know the budget of this movie? Later on, the right time is written in the stars. Meanwhile enjoy your place and this new phase in your life. Picture this: a new contract, a fabulous apartment, a fabulous girlfriend living in this place... -You living here? -Am I rushing into it? No, no. I’m just surprised. I’m really impulsive. I’m a Aries! I know nothing about the Zodiac, about not opening the door... Not opening the door? If someone opens your door to leave, this person will never come back. It’s a silly belief. Beliefs are ignorance. Astrology is Science. I opened your door to leave and I’m still going back to you. It’s up to you to let the door open. -How can I help you? -Rui? -Yes. -I came to see the apartment. Oh! It’s 11 o’clock! Mr. Montenegro, right? Come in. Excuse me. This is the living room. Nice view to the beach, so that you can relax when the Stock Market is closed. Don't you mention it! The view is amazing, actually. You can’t even view a poor community. Community. Yes. The name we use for things is very important. And for people. By the way, it’s unusual for someone so young to introduce himself using the surname. It’s because my parents chose a weird name for me. They were Ancient Rome lovers. -Caligula? -I wish. -It’s Nero. -Nero... -The emperor who set fire... -in Rome! Can you imagine the whities bullying me? “He set fire in Rome and was toasted too!”. Sorry for talking like that about white people. I don’t mind. I’m not white. Come again? White people have white skin, black or brown hair... My race is another. I’m a red-haired person. My skin is freckled. I’m a racial minority person. -You’re red... -Did you notice? You called me “red”. People call me names. -I was going to say “redefining”. -No... You think you were going to say this. But unconsciously you wanted to offend me. Call me red. I wonder if my parents intended to mark me, they called me “Rui” meaning “ruined skin”. To make me aware of the prejudice against my people, to fight for changes? Prejudice? I feel I can open myself to you. Because of our skins. And our names. Listen. Rui becomes “Ruined”. Nero becomes “Negro”. What about your surname? Monte-NEGRO. We suffer a lot, brother. You suffer? Black people have gone through a rough time during slavery. Unquestionably. But you fought and achieved social justice. You have a bright future ahead. What about us? You have a whole continent for racial presence! What about us? Seriously? Do you know how many redhaired people exist in the world? Only 2% of the population! You need a recessive gene to be a redheaded! Some articles say we will be gone until 2060! Not the black people! Because you stood up. You have red hair but you are white! White people don’t need organizations or movements We have to fight even nowadays... Yes! I’ll fight together you! I’ll call all red-haired people! Please, you have to embrace us in your organizations! We have to learn with you! You have to reach out to us! Teach us to be heard! Red is the new black. -Really? -Yes! I can’t stand irony. Asshole. -What has happened, Sandra? -Can I come in, Rui? Yes. We must think about alternatives. I’ve been talking to my son, who knows everything about cinema. Let’s see that Braddock story: “An ex-prisoner in the Vietnam War returns to the country to free American soldiers hold captive even after the end of the war”. So what? So, it’s the same story told in “Rambo 2”, starring Stallone. But “Missing in Action” was released before “Rambo 2”... My son told me that the producers admitted they read the script of “Rambo 2” and got inspired to make “Missing in Action”. They rushed to shoot it and release before “Rambo 2”. Rui, what I mean is “Rambo 2” is available! A friend of mine knows the owners of its rights! He can deal the rights with no deadline! So you have the guts to come to my office offering me to remake “Rambo 2”, that trash? It’s the same story, the original one! But there’s no Chuck Norris in that “Rambo 2” trash! But there’s Stallone, who is more famous! What did you say? What did you say, Sandra? Stallone is nobody compared to Chuck Norris! My son told me Stallone was nominated for an Oscar three times! And he lost every time! Stallone loses fights in his own movies! He lost in the first “Rocky” movie! He lost to Mister T in “Rocky 3”! He lost to a boy in “Rocky Balboa”! My son told me Chuck Norris lost a fight in a Bruce Lee movie. Your son is a snitch! Did he lose or not? “The Way of the Dragon”... Bruce Lee starred in it, so he had to win. But Lee was seriously injured after the fight. Listen carefully... Lee was... very injured. So as he died one year after he fought Chuck Norris. So what? It wasn’t a real fight, it was staged! Really? Was it? Are you sure? I wonder if Norris landed a punch that killed Bruce Lee slowly. Do you know? Does your son know? I think you’re in no condition to talk now. How do you expect me to react after you come to my office with this pathetic proposal? Holly gee! I just want to help you! Those guys are going hard. It makes no sense to set a deadline for the deal. It does make sense! Of course it does! -It’s a test! -What? It’s a test! Chuck Norris is testing me! He wants to know if I’m tough, if I’m worthy of being the new Braddock! That’s it! -I think it’s better we talk later. -Yes! I have to go. We talk on the phone, ok? -OK! Sure! -Have a nice day... I’m not running away! OK! Bye! THE DAWN OF MY LIFE We fight! Bruno? It’s Rui. I’d like to know if you got out of the red. Because we got out here. Wow, brother! You’re blonde now! Come in. Hey, man. Let’s work out hard today! Blonde Rui is going to smash it! It’s just a disguise for a mission. A mission? To sell this place. No more rust, no more red, no more problems. The disguise comes in the right time. -Why? -Haven’t you heard? -The “Mindless Redhead”? -What are you talking about? Check it out. There’s a guy in an online crusade against a mindless redhead who offends black people and is selling an apartment in this street. It must be you. More than 3000 likes on his post. He’s says “don’t buy the apartment owned by the mindless redhead who is mocking black people”. I just pointed out the red-haired issue! He wrote down your statements. In the comment box, everybody agrees that you’re mindless. I will never sell this apartment. You’re blonde now! Come in. Are you the director of Rui’s movie? Kibbeh? Kafka? It's Kofta! -How are you, Kofta? -I’m Sfiha! Make up your mind! What a homo! -It’s hummus. -What the hell! Rui can’t talk now, we’re going to work out! We are not, Diogo! I can’t think about exercises right now! What a quitter! Rui, the Mindless Redhead is you, right? I bet! There’s a campaign against the apartment selling! What now? I don’t know, Sfiha! I won’t worry about the Braddock movie anymore. I have been officially invited to direct the TV show. I will have to give an answer next week You’re not selling this place any sooner. So, do you accept the role in the show? -You’re blonde now! -Yes. -Is it a bad moment? -Yes. Come in. What a hot chick! And then you tell me you can’t get a girl. I’ve never told you that! But he really can’t. I thought he was gay for a while. -Sfiha! -What’s the matter? -Have you decided about that thing? -About what? About I moving here. You’re damned! Excuse me! Cintia, come with me please. Cintia, things are all messed up now, I’m confused with all these problems. You have that Virgo thing. -What? -It’s your rising sign! A Virgo is indecisive. I need to leave my place and you are stalling me! Look. Happiness is knocking on your door and you don’t say “come in”. Can you get out, please? So? He needs a time alone. Do you think Rui got stronger? He can’t gain muscles. It’s genetic. That’s what I suspected. -How is his English? -Terrible pronunciation. He can’t tell the difference between “red” and “head”. I noticed that. Do you think he will shoot that movie? With all these things, not even in his dreams. Is that a curse? A practical joke? Who is throwing rust in my place when I’m not around? Sfiha, do you know anything? Cintia, are you involved? Tell me, Diogo! Wait! Did Chuck Norris people hired you to screw me? Calm down! Breath, Rui. Nobody is being screwed here! -Rui is screwing this foxy girl, right? -What the hell? Shut up, Diogo! I can’t hear your voice anymore! There’s no more personal training! It’s over! It's "Personal training"! Cintia, you only hit on me when your friend smashed your dream of living abroad. But you will never live here! And the lessons are over. Take it easy, Rui! Sfiha, you’re my best friend! You should help me. But you don’t get me. I don’t want to be a clown in a party! Or to have a small role in cable TV! Much less playing a clown in a pathetic comedy show on cable! So put that role in your... bottom! I don’t even have a bottom. STOP You bastard! -Hey! -What’s up? Do you think you are Van Damme? Are you ok? Can I help you? Do you want me to call your father? Do you want any help? Is it everything ok? Can I help you? Do you want me to call your father? EVOLVE I’m not you. I don’t need to be you. I don’t need to be Braddock. I just have to sell this apartment! Even if I have to get you out of my head, Chuck! The invincible. The invincible. Are you really invincible? Aren't you? So, help me now! I want to see... I want to see you... Stopping me right now! Invincible. You are! But I’m not you! I don’t need to be you. Just try to beat me! Hi! Are you selling this place? Yes. Did you schedule a viewing? Oh, no! But I heard about it... Are you Rui? Yes. I’m Scarlet. Nice to meet you. -Are you American? -Yes! But I’ve been living here for years. I think I’m going to stay permanently. So I decided to buy an apartment. I mean, I asked daddy to buy an apartment for the family. Can I come in? Please, be my guest. You speak English! Sure. Just enough for... a project I was going to make. So, how did you know about this apartment? I’d never find it, since I was only searching in real estate agencies. I see. I didn’t want to pay fees. Anyway, how did you know? Don’t be mad. I’ve read a post in the internet, so I contacted the author. Montenegro. Damn! I understand you! You just told what happens to you. -You got it! -Yes. -It all happens to you too. -No... I’m pretty. Are the bedrooms there? Yes, but I use one of them as an office. Can I see it? Home office... Are you a lawyer? Oh, no! -Don’t even mention lawyers... -Measure your words! I have nothing against lawyers. But my lawyer can’t get me the rights to shoot a movie... Seriously? My father is a lawyer. But I don’t think he can help you, since he works in America. Really? It’s nice you work with Cinema. I love it! I came for a filmmaking study exchange program. I’d prefer Cuba, but you know how my country deals with the Reds. I do. So... Tell me about your movie. Never mind. Tell me! You shouldn’t know. It’s a remake. What’s the original one? We call it “Braddock - The Super Commando” Missing in Action! You know! -Sure! -Do you like it? -I don’t. But daddy loves Chuck Norris. I love Norris jokes! Specially about movies! Chuck Norris joined the Fight Club The Club was defeated! I’m about to have a heart attack. Chuck Norris is never going to have a heart attack. No heart is fool enough to attack Chuck Norris. It’s great, Rui. Are you ready? Good luck. Come here. Break a leg, Braddock! And break the Vietcong too! You're cute! Let’s go? We're late. I don’t care about the time. It’s a low budget film but it has to be good. We have the ideal lighting conditions. But it’s a night scene. DREAMING OF BRADDOCK I wish I could invincible in love And only reap value from everyone who misjudges me I wish life were a good place to be, And nothing was pain, Nothing was uneven But let not a word of mine be a regret, But a good wind trying to tell them That you don't need to see For you to find me Somewhere But you had to lose me For you to come look for me Somewhere But my soul is light now Today I came to say sorry because I heard you cry, I planted so much pain and left everything undone But this love you cry is what remains of me, Silent, as the day I left But the night still has my urgency, My confession at the naked dawn Because you don't need to see For you to find me Somewhere But I had to get lost For you to come look for me Somewhere... IN MEMORY OF THE MAKE-UP ARTIST AND HAIRDRESSER ALEXANDRE DE FARIAS ...But my soul is light now, Light is the hand of God in me Light is the dream that took me away from you But my soul is light now, Light is the hand of God in me But my soul is light now, Light is the hand of God in me
