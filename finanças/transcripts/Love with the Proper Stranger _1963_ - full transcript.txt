Look, anytime you're not happy with the hospitality at my apartment, use the deposit back on your key. Aw, come on, will you? I'm dying. My shirt is sweated right through. My bones ache. And my head's killing me. Are you okay, honey? You feel warm. I thought you were dying. What's the matter? Jane Russell would do it for Billy the Kid. My luck to wind up with a sex maniac. You good?

Great day. Marvelous day. What a I going to tell you? I'm sick and tired of that... kind of life I lead. Barb... - Hey, Barb... - Hm-hmm... A friend of mine asked me if I'd ask you if you knew the name of maybe a kind of doctor or something. He's got himself in a little trouble with a girl. Hey, Barb... You want me to find you a doctor? You want me to find you a doctor? Now wait a minute, I didn't... Angie! Angie! Angie! - Hey, Angie, over here! - Come in here. Come on. Come on. What are you looking. We happened to pass by you in the neighborhood so what's so terrible to give you a ride home? - It's embarrassing the fruit truck all the time. - Excuse me very much, your highness, when I start hauling vegetables in a limousine I'll pick you up in a limousine. All right, I grant you that time you went to the dance and everything... you were all dressed up and everything. I can see maybe you don't want to ride in a truck. But now you got on your regular clothes in the daytime. You're right, Dominic, what can I tell you? When you're right, you're right. Go talk to her lately, anything you say. Drive, will you, drive! I got a date tonight. She won't run away, I guarantee you. Miss skin and bones. Going out tonight, Angie? Why? Why, I'm making conversation. All right, who did you happen to bump into today? - What're you talking, will ya? - Nobody? Tell her, Julie, what happened. Did I do anything? Tell her. We bumped into, what's his name, Columbo. Columbo. Columsy! Is that nice? Why do you call a person names? Clumsy, Clumsy. He can't turn around without banging into something. Who wouldn't be clumsy the way you look at him? Make 'im nervous. Anyhow, we met him on the street. Did we meet him on the street, Julie? We met him on the street. He said, we talk:"how is Angie"? I said, "fine". He said, "maybe I'll drop by the house sometime". I said, "fine". He said, "maybe tonight". I said, "fine"... wonderful that you'd like to see him. That's the whole thing. I told you, Dominic, if you don't stop with this... What you telling me? The fella's coming over to the house. What should I tell him? You'd hate to see him? I'm not gonna see him! Why don't you like him? A nice boy, responsible, a nice little business of his own. I like him, I like him. I love him. He's Prince Charming, I'm crazy about him. Hey, you! Don't party in the kitchen. - It's a dance. - In a nightclub dance, in the kitchen eat. You can't keep him home. This one looks like an old lady. Why does it bother you? What's it your business? If I wanna stay home, if I wanna blow bubbles, I have a right to do what I like. That's what I like to do. Like? In America everybody wants to do what they like. What do they like? They don't know what they like. She's waiting in the store for a movie star on a big white horse. Mr Charming. Boy, a prince. What does she want? A movie star, she wants? On a horse? - Right, Angie? - Exactly. Is that all right with you, Ma? What? for me? As long as he's Catholic. - Hey, Angie. - In the old days a young person had respect. In the old days, you didn't have to like everything. You did what you had to do and if you didn't like it you liked it anyway. Take me, for example. I met your papa, rest his soul, on a Sunday, eh? And on Tuesday you were married. Yes. And what do I have, such a terrible life for 32 years? I hate to remind you about this, but today is not the Dark Ages when you were a little girl. Okay, today is the Light Ages, sure. Ah, questa campanella... All right, vengo, vengo. I'm not here. That's all. Angie! It's not nice. - Hey, look who's here. How are you? - I was just in the neighborhood... - Hi Tommy, nice to see you. - How are you doing? Wait a minute, I'm going to get Angie. - Angie, will you come on out. - Oh, for crying out loud! Can't I have any privacy in my house even in the bathroom? Is it gonna kill you just to say hello to him? - Dominic, I've told you 400 times... - What did you tell me, what? - Hey, will you get out there and... - Get out! I've lived my whole life in this house and never had a corner where I could put a turtle. To put a cat or a little turtle. Turtle, what turtle? You want a turtle? I want a room of my own. - What are you telling me? - You want a turtle, buy a turtle. It's my own fault. My own fault. It's me. I'm a big girl, I make my own money. Who says I have to live here if I don't wanna live here? And I don't wanna live here. I'm gonna move out of this house tonight. - This time I really mean it. - See? - Hey, look who's here. Mr Columbo is here. - Hi, I'm sorry, I mean uh... you know, excuse me for dropping in. I just happened to be in the... - We're gonna have some coffee. - Come on, Angie, let's have a cup of coffee. ...I catch you later. I was in the neighborhood... Darn it! Would you mind if I turn the water off? Come on, sit down. You're just in time for a cup. Oh, no, really, I couldn't. I just... - How's your mother? - Oh, she... Sit down. Bye-bye everybody. Have fun. Don't put a dent on that truck or I'll break your head. I... I didn't see her all week. So I seen your sister and I asked her. - She tells me it's a virus or something? - Yeah... Poor thing, everyday it's something new, eh? Well, they couldn't, you know, find anything... they took all the tests, but she still got this, you know... pain Come on, sit down. I'll get you a cup of coffee. And your other sister, how is she? Is she out of the hospital? Oh, next week, I think, well, you know... Ask him would he like a piece of cake or something. - Would you like a piece of cake or something? - No, no, I just came... ooh! - It's okay, it's okay. - Oh, che peccato. Presto una spugna. - It's all right. - Spero non si ai brusciatto. No, no, it's... It's all right. Una pi?, una meno. - Angie! - It's nothing. I'll fix it. So, how's everything in the restaurant business? Well, you know, one day it's pretty good and the next it's... uh, you know... you know, it's... Oh, look. - Let me do that. You'll cut your finger... - No, no. I... I'll fix it. Hey, Dominic, come on, we go in the other room and we close the door. On the couch I wouldn't trust them five minutes, but in the kitchen... what can happen? Come on, andiamo, va... Why don't you sit down? You just... sit down. If I sit down, I'll probably break the chair. I don't know what it is. You oughta see me during the day, I... I got 10, 15 hamburgers going, I got franks in the grill... white down, wheat down... scramble a pair in a skillet. I don't know. With this hand I'm breaking lettuce I just don't know what it is. All you have to do is just look at me and... What's the matter? What happened? Look, I... I better ask you what I... You know... Well, I... anyhow, the thing is they're having this dance, you know... like a dance... over ate the Sons of Garibaldi... and I thought that... that uh... Well, you... you probably got a date already, probably. This Saturday night? This Saturday? Tomorrow night? I knew it. Well... Listen, it's uh... - Good night, everybody, I gotta... - Where are you going? What's your hurry? Well, you know, listen, with the kind of help you got to put up with these days, you know... you're out of business in a couple of hours. I'll see you, Dom, Julie. It's good to see you, Mrs Rossini. Come again soon, eh? - Listen, I'm sorry about... - Oh, that's... that's okay. Next time. Listen, what are you doing New year's Eve? It's only nine months away. I'm kidding you. I'm joking. It's... it's a big joke, huh? I'm a big comedian. Well... listen... Good night, Angie. Good night, Anthony. What are you doing? Where are you going? - I'm old enough. Make my own decision. - Hey, - will you stop that. - Oh, no, no, let her go. You wanna go? Go, go. How many years have I got left in this world? - Go, go, be happy. - Mamma, she don't mean it. I mean it! I mean it! Go, be a mother in America. Day and night you watch her, day and night. You take her here, you meet her there. Your whole life you're waiting in the truck afraid maybe some lunatic might grab her in the street. For what? So that she go in the room with a movie star on a horse? I don't know. I tell you the truth. On papa's grave I don't understand what's so terrible. What should I say? Go in the street? Who cares about you? I care about you. Do me something. I love you. Don't love me so much. - Hey, America... - I can't breathe. How can I tell you? Even if I didn't wanna do anything crazy. Once, just once, I have to. I really have to, just to keep from... choking to death. - Every night he goes out with all kinds of... - Guido, Guido, Guido's a boy. Who cares what he does? - Guido. - Angelina, bella mia, I love you. All right, too much. Go, go in the world by yourself in a room. Go, go eat in a drugstore by yourself. If that's want you want to make you happy, find yourself with strangers? Go! I'll go see her tomorrow. We'll have a talk. I'll find out what's the matter. Take her out to lunch. Actually, you know, this looks orange. Yeah, they call it rust. Well, you never can tell what the manufacturer's going to say. I wonder if you could show me something else. - Oh, yeah. - Thank you, I'd appreciate that. Hi. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Would you excuse me one moment, please? You know how many people are on the fifth floor at Macy's? That's all you told me, Macy's, fifth floor. - I'm sorry. I thought I told you. - Fifth floor you told, that's all, you know. I'm sorry. Pretty, pretty tweety. C'mon, bite my finger. Look, all I came to say was I made you an appointment Sunday afternoon and I got you a doctor, okay? I'll write down the address and, if you want, it's $400. Got a piece of paper? Four hundred dollars. How much can you raise? Maybe two at the most. Yeah... You... you raise half and I'll try to raise half. Okay? I don't know anything about this guy, so... I'll meet you there 3 o'clock Sunday afternoon. Got a piece of paper? I'm sorry. Look, if you're not absolutely sure about this then, I mean, just... There's only four here. You'll need another fifty. - What do you mean, they told me four. - Right, plus fifty for me. Yeah? Well I don't have it. Bring it with ya. Four o'clock. - But you'll... - Here's the address. Third floor, front. - Yeah, but what happens if I... - Five minutes late, don't bother coming. But what happens if I can't go... Wait a minute! - He says another fifty. - What? I got thirteen. How much you got? I think I have about... eleven. And some change. We got about 45 minutes. You got any ideas? C'mon. Where? To get the money. All right, lady, drop the gun. - How're you doing, sexy? - Uh... gimme your face to see. What's the matter? Postcard once in a year? Can't you say hello? Hm? Give me a kiss. Come on! Hey, where do you live now? Milan or someplace, Africa? Two minutes, you get on a subway, you pick up the telephone... Mamma, mamma, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Angie... Rossini. Hi. Mamma, she's a friend. Friend? Who says no? She's an enemy? Where's poppa? Where? He's losing the money. Believe me, they live across the street by the U.N. They take everything so serious. Like my husband. With the bunch and game? Goodbye, Charlene. What do you give me, a dollar? I tell you what he's gonna say. "What the damn hell, he's home," watch. Enrico, take my place. What the damn hell. - He's home. - What did I tell you? He's got a girlfriend. So what else is new? Where she work, in a saloon? - Hey! - Poppa... - Oh, I'm sorry. - I want you to meet a friend of mine, - Angie Rossini. - Excuse my big mouth. I didn't know he meant a friend in person. And what I said about the saloon is because... he bring home a girl... Believe me... I'd be ashamed to be seen with the same girl at a party. Ma questo mascalzone... he bring her in the house. That was ten years ago and he still put me on a bike. How're you doing, pop? - How're you feeling? - Me, like a horse. He's some horse. He's up all night like a horse coughing from the cigarette. Shut up! She talk, eh? Let's take her... you want something to eat, eh? - A bottle of wine... - Si, si, come on, come with me. How're you doing? All right? Okay. - What do you need, a couple of dollars? - Can't I come down just to see you, poppa? Come on, take it, big shot. Take it. And don't say anything to your mother. Angie, come on, I want show you some. I want you to meet some of my friends. - How're you doing, beautiful? - Nothing, not a cent, not a penny, nothing. Did I ask? What did I ask? Rocky. Hey, how are you? - How've you been? - Good. I can't believe it. Hey, you seen Beetie? - No, I haven't. - She's sitting right over there. - Come on over say hello. - Look, I got a couple of things I gotta do... Come on, say hello. Come on, now. It's been a long time. Beetie, Beetie, look who's here. Hi, Maria... Maria, come here, Maria. How're you doing? Great. You're looking great. I told you not to climb. Maria. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, she's really big. You oughta see my older boy. He's bigger than me. - My girlfriends are waiting. - Hey, shut up a minute. This is Rocky Papasano. We grew up together. We went to the same school. Hey, don't you remember the time I said thought I saw him on the Lawrence Welk show on television? Hey, he's been everywhere. Hollywood, everyplace. Bye. Come on eat with us, eh? - Oh, no, no. - Oh, come on. - No, we should stay. - All right, come on, eat, come on. Aspetta. Mamma, I don't need Mamma... Shut up. If you tell your papa, I break your face. Oh, no, no. La signorina prima. My brother's here. - Hm? - My brother's here. What brother? In the truck. Mamma... What happened? I have to go, poppa. Rocky! Rocky! Guido, go get him. What're you standing there? Go get him, go on! That did it. I can't even run anymore. Brothers now. Quarter to four we're gonna sneak out the back way and get a cab. Well, we got the money, in case you're interested. Look, I'm gonna leave now. You don't have to go with me. I mean it. Just... just give me the... address and tell me where I'm supposed to go. Sure, I'm going to let you go up there alone, huh? You don't have to worry about protecting me. Why did you go with me that night in The Mountains? Do you mind if I ask you that? Let's forget about that. Will you just forget about it? How do I know why I did it? I don't know. I'm just stupid. It was just a stupid... experiment. The hotel is full of women, I wind up with Louis Pasteur. Oh, boy, how they build things up. In the books, in all the movies. How the world comes to an end every time the flame of your lips touches mine. All I felt was just scared and disgusted with myself. Oh, really? Look, he's insulted. Don't take it personally. Thanks. You uh... you want a little vino? Man, there's been a lot of vino under the bridge today. Just think a pair of nights with a girl. You know the girl at the park? My friend the big guy's wife? You wouldn't believe this. She's two years younger than me. Would you believe that? Man, I hate to come back here. That girl and I, we used to break a lot of bread together. Now we look at each other and we got nothing to say. That's what love is? Bells and banjos play? How they brainwash you. And here I spend my whole life life like a nut, waiting for what? A stranger. Listen, it's possible. - Don't tell me you believe that. - Well, it's a well-known chemical fact. Some people, you just have to look ate them. It's kind of kicky. With other people, chopped liver. Well, that's true, but... how come... You know, my class in high school. Half a dozen kids, they couldn't live without each other. They got married... and almost everyone of them now... either they're divorced already or they're miserable. Well, let's face it. Ever take a close look at a married man? Prisoner of Zenda. Not everybody. Nine times out of ten. Maybe. I don't know. I used to try to pick out the people who lived alone, you know? in the subway, in the street... and almost everytime they had those... I don't know, glassy eyes. Nothing's living in them. Right? I don't know. Dead. What are you looking at me for? Do I look dead to you? Couldn't resist it. I don't know. Hey, you wanna see something? Hey, come here. - Is that you? - Yeah, you like that haircut? I kinda like the haircut, but those knickers... Hey, hey, I was a very cool cat. It seems very funny putting you together with a family somehow. What did you think, I got hatched out of an egg? In a way they love you. What are you talking about love? What... What's love about it? They're glad to see me? They haven't seen me for a long time. Let me hang around here for a couple of months, I'll melt right into the wallpaper just like everybody else. Love, huh? That's what makes it rough. When they love you. Come in. Come on. Come on. - Move. - Come on. Hey, buddy, wait. You have to wait out here now. Come on, hurry up. Get undressed. Oh, come on. Take it easy. Are you a doctor? You said a doctor. Take it or leave it. Come on, put your clothes on. Get your clothes on. We're gonna get out of here. Come on. Come on! Get your clothes... Come on, get your clothes on and... Come on... Come on... get your clothes on. Get your clothes on. I want you to get out of here. Get your clothes on. Now! Get your... - Oh, God... - Get your clothes on now. No... No, no, no, no, no! I'll kill them before they can touch you. I'll kill them... It's okay, it's a friend of mine's apartment. He works nights. You need some rest. Hi. Now knock it off. It's been a rough morning. All right, now. Here, eat. No, no, that's not yours. Here. No, no, here's yours. Don't you believe in knocking? What are you doing here? Paying the rent, for one thing. Which brings me to a little Orphan Annie you parked here. Incidentally, without my permission. Number one, which I would not give you, number two over my dead body. Take it easy, will you? I want you to meat a friend of mine. Dominic Rossini, Barbie Margolies I'm sorry we kinda busted in on you like this. - Oh... - Where's the girl? Honey, would you put some coffee on, hm? Well, it's a lovely day, isn't it? - Angie... - I gotta talk... I have to tell you, Angie, I... When he told me my whole stomach turned over on me. I mean it. I'll tell you the truth, I can't believe it. Anyhow, we had a long talk. And the thing is, he came to me like a man. And he's willing to marry you. Why? I know you're embarrassed by the stupid way he put it, but... I'm not embarrassed. I'd like to know. What do you mean stupid? Stupid, you're stupid. - You're calling me stupid? - Why don't you cool it? Will you stop that? Sit down. The both of you. The both of you, will you sit down? Do you want to get married? I said I would, didn't I? That's not what I asked you. Well, who wants to get married? You mean, even though you don't wanna marry me... you're willing to do it anyway? Well... I'm just... just as much to blame as you are. More, it was my fault the whole thing and I'm willing to take my medicine. That's really wonderful. And I'm the medicine, right? I know this may come as a great big shock to the both of you... but underneath all this hair and skin is a human girl. With all the regular things going for me. Believe it or not, I don't wanna spend the rest of my life married to a man who's doing me a big favor. - What did I say? - What are you talking about? All right, I made one mistake. And it was a beaut. But that doesn't mean I have to ruin my whole life, and his, and the baby's. The man is willing to marry you. What do you want? I don't want to be a warden all my life. The Prisoner of Zenda? Look... I appreciate what you're willing to do. I mean that. I really mean it. But as long as you feel like being married is being in jail then you won't be happy, right? So if you're not happy, then you take it out on me. And then I'm not happy. And if you're not happy, then I'm not happy, and the baby's not happy. - Who needs a house full of unhappy people? - Where are you going? I don't know. I gotta get out of here. I'm gonna be late for work. Well, you know, you wanna... you wanna here me say I wanna get married? All right. I wanna get married. I'm only... I'm only trying to be honest with you. Tell the truth. If I said okay, your teeth would fall out. Right or wrong? Dominic, I really owe you an apology, you know. I really do. All this time I've been blaming you for everything. You ruining my life and all that. Well, that's over now. You know why I've never been able to leave home? I just suddenly figured it out. Very complicated. I was scared. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm terrified. Funny? Well, listen. Thank you Barbie for the use of the Teddy bear. Coffee anyone? All my life sacrifying myself to have her away like this. - She'll come back... - Nonsense! I understand how you feel Mrs Rossini. But in this country it isn't considered unusual for a girl to want an apartment of her own. You see, Father, there's a little more to it than just wanting an apartment... Oh, sure, tell him. Tell the whole world. Why don't you put it in the paper. Mamma, we asked him to come here to help. He's a priest, Ma. In the church he's a priest. In my house he don't have to know everything. - All right, mamma, you rest now. - Yes, yes, in my grave I'm gonna rest. It's like a stab in my heart. - Take it easy, mamma. - Go away! Leave me alone! In my grave I'm gonna rest. Hey, don't forget... What we're trying to do... is there any way you can make a person get married if they don't wanna? There must be a law or something. Look, there's no law. I told you before, you can't force a person to get married. Look, I'll bury you. Get him out of here. Get him out of here. Not in front of the priest. Get out of here. Go out to the kitchen. Sit down. You can force somebody to pay upkeep, or something like that but you can't force somebody to get married. My son, often in this world you'll find that the law of man comes second to the law of God. - And the individual conscience of man... - Look, Father, I... Admit your guilt, my child, and face the full responsibility. I'm willing to get married. She won't. - But didn't you say... - She don't wanna. I'll tell you what she wants. She wants bells and banjos. - Banjos? - What banjos? You want me to tell you something? What am I doing here? I was willing to do my part. She didn't want me. Right? Good luck. From now on it's your problem. - From now on it's... it's your problem. - Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. - Listen, just for a minute. - No. Wait a minute, just a second. What a shame! What a shame. What have I done to deserve this? Hey, Angie! - Hi. - How are you? Fine. - How are you? - Fine. That's fine. How're you doing in your little room and everything? Who said it's a little room? It's two rooms and a half. Mom's in bed, you know. We had a doctor and everything. I think she lost the will to live. Dom, she'll live. Listen, I gotta run. I'll see you, okay? Taxi! Listen, maybe we could have... - some lunch or something? - What? I said maybe we could have lunch or something. Oh, I can't, Dom. I got an appointment. Taxi. Who with? The beauty parlor. Okay, what for? Hey, taxi! What you got? A date or something? Maybe. Okay, who have you got a date with? Taxi. Do I know him? Where did you meet him? Can't you tell me who he is, at least? Rock Hudson. On a horse. So I'm lucky I fell on my, you know, wrist. - I know this lady lives on the Avenue... - The cake is almost, you know. and she was walking down the, you know, street and she fell down and broke something in her back something and now she can't move both her, you know, legs. Excuse me, I better see if the, you know... - Anthony. - Oh... If I could see what I'm eating, I could eat. Oh, mamma, leave it romantic. It's romantic enough. Excuse me, I'll go see if I can you know, help. - Hi. - Hi. Hot. Careful, it's hot. Oh, I'll do it. Did you want tell your mother? I haven't told her yet. But I'm going to. I'm... I'm gonna tell her what uh... I'm... I'm gonna tell her about the uh... you know, the baby, and uh... Well... only... what I'm gonna tell her is... I'm gonna tell her that I'm the... you know, the father. Get some butter. - Cold water, cold water. - No, no, it's all right. Butter, will you get the butter? - It's all right, it's all right. - You sure? It's fine, it's fine. - You hurt yourself. - No, no! - No, it's nothing. - You sure? - Yeah, yes. - Sit down. I'll help him. No, I'd like to, really. I love to help in the kitchen. What are you gonna help. There's nothing to help. But, will you... will you, both of you, please sit. All of you, you know, come on, sit down. Too many here, to many cooks spoil the, you know... the broth. - Better have a doctor check that hand. - Oh, oh. Oh, my goodness. Very sorry. It's 9 out of 10 accidents happen in the home. It's statistics. This is really a lovely room. You have wonderful taste. What you've done to this apartment. Okay! I'm ready! Readier. I'm uh... you know. Anthony. Oh, it's beautiful. Just beautiful. What's... what's the idea? Well, I thought that... you know, like uh... the 4th of July, huh? Big joke, huh? Mamma... when Anthony gets married you will not be losing a son. Somebody will be gaining a cook. it's... er... College girl. Going to college. You'll have to excuse my mother. She's anti-education at the present moment. Ever since I told her I was taking a course in love. A course in love? Well, it not really, it's just part of a course. I only say that to agitate them. The concept is that love taken on the mature level as opposed to the uh... erotic, or the so-called romantic, with all its false conceptions, is really an art. And like every other art, it demands practice and patience consistent dedication and hard work. I believe that. I really do. Oh, well, of course. Now... now, how can any intelligent person in this age of reason make the most important selection of his life merely on the basis of some kind of vague sexual attraction? Of course. Uh, I mean, if two people just start out being nice to each other if they're just concerned about what happens to each other that's all... and they... and they're just nice... then I think it happens. Don't you? - What do you mean? - Love. I mean, what they call being in love. I think that love, actually, as such... is strictly a middle-class idea. And it is definitely on its way out. Yes, I think so too. Actually. I mean, I don't think that love is something that you... fall into. Like a hole in the ground. Now, if a person is even halfway mature when you consider the enormous responsibilities involved in marriage, you can't take it lightly. You can't. Knowing that the future generation is entirely due to the wisdom of your procreation. Of course. - You want the... - Sorry. I just don't know what is the matter with me. - Well, I'll get a towel... you know, wipe it. - Don't worry about the dress, I'm just... - worried about the dinner table. - That's all right. We're only lucky it wasn't, you know, hot coffee. Oh, it's terrible. I'm so sorry. She's not a bad-looking girl. But she's so clumsy. Hi. Oh, hi. How're you doing? Fine. I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop up see how you were making out. Oh... So, how's everything? Fine. No, I mean the problem. Fine. What do you mean fine? Would you excuse me just a minute, please? Listen, what time do you get off? Let's have a cup of coffee or something. Will you excuse me a minute? Well, what do you say? Shall I pick you up after? Oh, I can't tonight. Uh, all right, well uh... Tomorrow then, okay? I'll pick you up after or what? No, I can't tomorrow night either. Oh. What... what do you mean you can't? It's a cup of coffee. Well, I've got a date. With who? What's funny? If I didn't know better, I'd swear you're my brother Dominic. Look. I... I just wanted to see you that's all. See how you feel and see how you're making out. Uh... so, fine, I saw you. And every... everything's fine, so... fine. Oh. Listen... Do you want to make it Monday? Monday, what am I supposed to do? Wait around until Monday? Hey, Angie, when you get a minute. All right, I'll meet you Monday. I'll see you Monday. Come here a minute. Look, why don't you come to my place Sunday? I'll make dinner.

I really mean it. - Look how surprised he sounds. - You look so... What am I gonna tell you? You look like a woman. How can you manage to make even a compliment sound like a slap in the face? What did I say? You look like a woman. I apologize, excuse me. You look like man. Do you wanna fight all day? Who's fighting? I don't wanna fight. All right, then. Sit down. I'll make you a drink. I don't know what it is. First time in my life I come to see a girl and I feel like I'm 14 years old. Even whe I was 14 I didn't feel like that. They're beautiful. Thank you.

Said I could have a job there if I wanted to. Permanently. Really. That's wonderful. Wonderful? Five days a week, rain or shine, in sickness or health, who needs it? I go where the wind blows me. If I don't wanna go to work, I don't have to go to work. And I can stay in bed all day long if I want to. So wonderful. You're happy. Well, I am. I really am. Nice place you got here. It really is. You can see you put a lot of yourself in it. Little things here and there. Very nice. You made it very nice. You know something? If you didn't try so hard to play against it you could be e pretty decent kind of a person. Look how surprised she sounds. What do you think you're doing? - As if I didn't know. - Come here, Louis. Louis? A new kind of experiment. Don't. You better understand something here and now. What we did before, that was something happened don't ask me how or why, but it's not gonna happen again.
