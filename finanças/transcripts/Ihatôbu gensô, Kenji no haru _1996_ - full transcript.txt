You mean master Kenji? Yeah, he suddenly starts singing in the middle of class. He talks about 4-dimensional spaces which we don't understand. The night of the last full moon he was dancing in the schoolyard. That's not the half of it! Master Kenji can even hear the voices of ghosts! Really? It's true! Under the lone cedar tree at the shrine to foxes, there was a female spirit... You two should quiet down. You should be studying until the teacher gets here. Shut up. You're such a goody two-shoes. Why did he...? Rise and shine, Chusaku! Yeah... I'm sorry I'm late. It was so warm outside. I was in the sun with the flowers... and forgot what time it was. It's spring already. Do you know why you feel warmth? Warmth? Do you understand? I have NO idea. Now, let's close our textbooks... and close our eyes as well. Close our eyes? Yes, everyone else close your eyes, too. Even when your eyes are closed like they are now, you can feel it, can't you? You can feel the warmth of the spring sunlight... and the softly singing breeze with your whole body. Our bodies consist of invisible, tiny tiny molecules: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon. The air, the water, even flower petals... everything is made of molecules just like us. Even when we don't move, molecules in our body are moving at a terrific speed. Do you have any idea how many times hydrogen molecules impact other molecules in a second'? 100 million times. 100 million times! Just in one second, they collide 100 million times. The movement of molecules changes into heat and temperature. When you are happy or excited, when you think of your love, doesn't your chest feel warm? That's because feelings are moving the molecules of your body... and changing the movement into heat. A human made up of active molecules... Kind of like a festival. A festival? Isn't that Kenji of the Miyazawa family? L-low can someone like that be a teacher? Shere Kahn-sensei is weird. "When it gets warm and molecules start moving around..."!! A human is also made of molecules. Let's romp in the sun," he said. Yeah, he's REALLY weir-- What? He took something out! Hush! It's coming. Long stretching blue note A bird is a blue string And a string A blue string... I lost it. What the...? Found them! Found them! All right... What does this look like? What does it look like? It's just a stone. That's correct, but is it really only that? Doesn't it look like someone's face? This stone is limestone... smooth and pretty like a movie actress. Ahh... I see... This is quartz, rugged and stubborn looking like our principal. It really does! Hey, this looks like you. Look. This is Kasuke. And this is Saburo! There are so many differences between stones... just like the differences between us. Let's talk to them. They're just rocks! You are weird! He's more than weird! Now... Listen to them. You'll hear different voices by hitting them. This is the voice of stone. This is the voice of the earth! 6 years earlier A vast field extending as far as you can see. The sweet and sour smell of grass... and the fresh breeze wash away all the impurity. The world is filled with light. Being in such a place, don't you feel like you can even become God? Let's go. Yeah. Drawing close together, The telegraph poles stand hand in hand. Mental-Sketching" again? Yeah. When I come here, images just flow. Wow! ! I dream of someday having a beautiful farm, like the starry heavens. There we'll have plays and festivals, and create a new form of farming village art. What's your dream? My dream? My dream is... to find the invisible power working behind this world, and solve the riddle of that true power. That's a nice dream. But how do you go about doing that'? I haven't figured it out yet. I see. Well, I'm sure you'll find it some clay. Do you really think so? Yeah. In fact, I hope I can take that path with you. Kane! A dinosaur! There! In the amber colored sky, There passes the giant reptile of the Mesozoic. Miyazawa's Pawn Shop No, I can't offer any more than that. I know, but... we need the money to buy bullets. Otherwise, how can we hunt this winter'? But you know, you have only used clothing and a hatchet here. I know, but these are the last things we have left. To look after my sick mother... 62 sen is the limit. (Sen = 100th of a Yen) I can't loan you any more than that. Thank you for your trouble. Kenji! Were you wandering around again collecting junk all night long? You should help our business instead. Why? Why can't you loan him more? He needs more. You can't mix sympathy with business. Otherwise we go bankrupt and the economy of the society fails. But- but such work... What do you want to do instead? I'm... I'm going to sell Ukiyo-e (woodblock paintings). You're being unrealistic. Who would buy such paintings in a rural town? Well, then, what about starting a new business in America? You're getting too big for your britches. L-low would you get capital to get started? Uh... Oh yeah... What about making artificial gems? I work making precious gems for half a year, and spend the other half writing children's stories. Sounds like a pipe dream. Nobody will read stories that sound like a foreigner mumbling in their sleep. Besides, do you plan to sell the gems as man made? Why can't I tell them the truth? The gems will be synthesized by a proper scientific process. What's this about science? Why don"t you quit dreaming? It's not a dream! You're dreaming! Not a dream!!! You haven't had your baptism by fire. I suggest you get your feet on the ground. It's still warm. The thoughtful way you held the stone kept it warm. Toshi! You're home. Mm-hm. We took the night train leaving Ueno at 8 o'clock last night. You were off collecting stones as usual. Yeah. We went all the way to Nametoko mountain creek. That far? Here. Put this stone in the light and take a good look. Pretty. The shiny pieces are black mica crystals. They formed a long, long time ago... when they were still drifting gas in the galaxy. All they could see was the absolute darkness in space. Now, when I broke the stone in pieces, the micas for the first time see the blue sky. Not being able to speak out, they just twinkle. Very nice. Hymn number 391. I learned it at college. I see. Did you learn a lot more? A whole bunch. Oh, have a look at that. WOW ! From Sheffield! Expensive, wasn't it? I'll bake a cake for you all. Woohoo! When the poet Mr. Tagore came to this country to lecture, his servant taught me how. Ho! Sounds great. You're still writing, huh? Yeah. Did you read my poetry book "Azalea" I sent to you? Of course. One of the poems you wrote, it goes, "Drawing close together, Telegraph poles stand hand in hand." Is that you and Kanai-san? You're so obnoxious. Bingo! At any rate, Kanai is a great guy. He's very decisive, unlike myself. You two are the only people who understand me. You sound like you're in love with the guy. Hey, come on! You blushed! Jeez... Anyhow, I just feel like we can be together for a long time. Yeah, for a long time, long time. Toshi! I've left my home town. Already half a year has passed since I moved to Tokyo. Now I work for a small publishing company. I write, write, and write. I keep writing. This Sunday, if convenient for you, I'd like to meet you in the library in Ueno forest. We haven't seen each other in three years. We can talk all day long about literature, plays, and our long search together for the path to the “true Way.“ Kanai Hosaka-san... This is Miyazawa. I wanted to see you very much. Miyazawa-san. Les. I... can't join you on your search. Toshi...! Is Toshi alright? Oh! Kenji! Kenji! Toshi. That was quick. Oh look! Your feet! Your feet! In a bit of a rush, are we? Don't be so up-tight. In the west they wear shoes indoors all the time. Oh, Kenji! What are you doing? Oh dear. You can even laugh, so you must be alright. Don't make me worry about you! I wrote so much, in lieu of having a family... This much?! Too many things to write! My hand wouldn't stop. The words hopped out in front of me, and they even bowed to me! That sounds like you. I'll get the light. I don't want to die yet. I want to continue to be a school teacher. I want to have a boyfriend... Never mind. I've said strange things. No, not strange at all. You can still have those things. You can even have a boyfriend. Please stop. Tell me. Tell me the stories you wrote. Tell me. All right. We may not have crystal sugar as much as we want. We can, however, eat the delicate translucent breeze, and drink in pink sunlight of the golden morning. I've so many times seen in fields and woods. .. The most beautiful velvet and studded garments... spun from the most miserable and torn clothes. I adore such beautiful food and clothing. AH of these stories of mine... are bestowed upon me by the rainbow and moonlight... at woods, meadows, and rail road tracks. When I walk through the oak forest in the blue sunset, when I stand shivering in the November mountain winds, I really feel this way. I only wrote what I felt. I cant stop feeling things like this. These visions really happen. Spring and Ashura By Kenji Miyazawa No one bought it... l-low much do you think this cost us'? I'm sorry. Go to a bookstore and see what kind of books are selling most. But I don't write to sell. If you won't write to sell, I should say, "help our family business!" But I won't say that. If you take over the family business, you'd only lose all of our assets. Concentrate on teaching. The phenomenon of myself is simply a blue lighting of hypothetical organic alternating current electric lights. Together with everyone, the scenery restlessly palpitates... Hey, What's "palpitate?" What's that? What does it mean? A transparent complex. ...? Sensei! Yes. I don't understand at all. Not at all! Not at all!! There are some things that you won't understand, but I don't understand them either. Why? Why can't you come with me? If in this world, the great power really exists, Why do people fight? Why do living things eat each other? Be- Because... Maybe that's also the will of great power... No. Shall we go in search of the answer? You are walking on the clouds. Yes, clouds of ideals. Sensei! Sensei! What happened? Oh, it's just you. Sensei, are you feeling sick? No. By the way, what's the matter? You're all congregated... We found the guilty person. Yeah we did! The guilty person? My hat was stolen. A lamp in our dorm is missing... Narao saw it at night. He saw Takagi stealing it! Let's... Let's stay on the straight and narrow for as far as we possibly can. What the hell, "let's stay on the straight and narrow." If you're going to scold me, get it over with, why don't you!'? What the hell?! You didn't run away. This is karma, that you and I are teacher and student... among millions of people on Earth. Isn't that so? That means we could be father and son, or brothers. No, from now on let's clearly be brothers. Yes, real brothers. By the way, why do you take someone else's stuff? If you want money or other things, I, your big brother, will give them to you, my brother. My salary is 90 Yen and if you need all 90 Yen, I'll even give it all to you. If it is not enough, tell me. No matter what it takes, even if I have to borrow it, I'll give you what you need. My brother. Now let me hear your dreams. What are you going to do after you finish school? I want to go live in a big city... and work for a public government office or in a bank. And... Aren't you going to help your family? Being a peasant doesn't make money. I... I want to make money. And... Sensei! I want to live without my brother, father, and mother having to suffer anymore like they have. Did you hear the rumor that Shere Kahn is going to quit? Is that true? Someone overheard talking in the teachers' lounge. But why? No idea! It's because you've been too mischievous. EXCUSE ME!! But school's gonna be boring without him. Hey! It's sensei! In the school yard! Sensei! Sensei! Don't quit! See you in the fields below. He's just an amateur. What can an amateur do? It's only a rich man's son's whim. He'll soon give up. In the new age, the world gathers into a consciousness and becomes one creation. Peasant Arts Theory Peasants Modern Science Consciousness The Galaxy In the new age, the world gathers into a consciousness and becomes one creation. In the new age, the world gathers into a consciousness and becomes one creation. Party, party every day all, night long. He says that's art. Peasants don't need that crap. That's something a bored man does. Fertilizer consultation - Free - Flowers don't put food on the table. It's so delicious! Take it home. Why? Mom made it for you. I can't eat anything better than what the people here do. But you're worn to a shadow. If you become like Toshi... Go home. You are such a fraud! What the hell is your science! What does an amateur know about fertilizer! He says he'll pay us for all losses. Don't patronize us. Because his family is rich, he thinks he can fix things with money. Sensei! Hey, you two. Let's start, Takagi. I'm in the field below. - Kenji. All... All stolen. I'm in the field below. - Kenji. All... All stolen. When I came back from the fertilizer consultation at Miyamori village... Damn it! It must be the people of the village downstream. I wanna go beat them up... but I don't have the courage to do it. So I'm trying to calm my emotions by marking like this. But, I'm a little bit confused... because, well, yes, we've grown them with great care, but isn't it the same thing that we would eat the vegetables, thereby taking their lives? By the way, I noticed that you are the only one here tonight. Takagi left for Tokyo to find a job. His father is ill and farming doesn't help them pay back their debts. So... he wouldn't dare see you. Good morning. Helped the whole night again, did you? Ah, beautiful morning. Sensei. Why don't we quit? Working on things like this... You working hard alone... It doesn't change a thing. What is this? That's tea. I arranged a pine leaf in the water of the dawn. I still think you're weird. We may not have crystal sugar as much as we want... We can, however, eat the delicate translucent breeze... ...And drink in pink sunlight of the golden morning. Peasant life is hard work, certainly. That's why we should try to enjoy it. Sensei... After all, I couldn't even be the village idiot. My whole body is heavy... Feeling like sinking to the bottom of the earth. Trying to eat the same as the common people... Talking, saying things like marrying a cloud in the sky... But probably nothing I thought of was true. At the bottom of my heart I was hoping good things would happen. Hallucination again. Is this is my end? In the dark cloud touching the ground... In the dark cloud touching the ground... Can't it be me? Can't I be the one to move the darkness? Is the world flickering or am I flickering? The light is kept but its tradition is lost. Will I change? I'll change. Will this change? It'll change. How about this? It won't change. No, MI change. It'll change. After all, what everyone else said was right. What should I do... Nothing I do works. Please get me snow, Kenji. Please get me snow, Kenji. Please get me snow, Kenji. Please get me snow, Kenji. Here, I got you snow. Cold... Cold but warm. Because you got it for me... this snow is cold but warm. Toshi... Cold but warm... Cold but warm... Toshi... Copernicus of the new age! Release this galaxy from the overbearing force of gravity! In search of true happiness... endlessly. If I go on a little more... A meteorite...? From another star? It can't be. Spring is almost here. Bitterness and blueness of anger... I am Ashura oh the bottom of the April light... In an airborne state, coming and going... Grimacing and clenched with effort. Ave Maria Kenji continued writing, even while suffering from a serious illness that left him bedridden. He died a year later, at the age of 37. His writings, some of which were unfinished, were discovered after his death, and became immensely popular. Today, Miyazawa's writings are some of Japan's best loved literature.
