You think I like missing my daughter's birthday? German... Just come home whenever you like. - I said, let go of my arm! - Silvia! Please! - That Gloria's nothing but trouble! - Get off my back! It's my life! How many times do I have to say it? Silvia, please don't go! I'm begging you! Are you going to go? - You think I'm going to stay here with you? - Don't talk to your mom like that. She's my mom, I can talk to her however I like! Wash that stuff off your face. You're staying home! - No, I'm not, asshole! - You little... While you're living under our roof, you'll do as we say! - What are you doing? - Silvia! Let's see how brave you are now! Don't mess with me! I'm 17 years old and I'm not staying here!

You're going to love it! ...The death of a close friend. My friend was drowning in the pool. He's a heavy guy, but I got him out of the water and put him on the side. The look in his eyes... The life was draining from him. Seeing death like that, it's awful. Since then, I always think about... CIVIL GUARD - Good evening. - Good evening. One of your lights is out. Really? I didn't know.

I'm not going to hurt you. I'm a good person. I swear it wasn't me! I already had that dent on the car. You said you knew who did it. I'm a good person. I'm a good person. Hello? You can't stay out here. You need to see a doctor. Help! Help! Help me, please! What are you doing? Open the door. I'm not going to hurt you. Get in the front seat. Don't be silly. I'm not going to hurt you. My bumper was already dented! I just want to take you to hospital, - to see a doctor or a psychologist. - I'm not crazy! What? That's not what I meant. Hey! Open the door!

How long ago was the call made? - Twenty minutes, Sergeant. - Have they located the call? The emergency operator told us that from the range of coverage provided by the antenna, he was probably on road CM-320, around exit 14. There's a margin of error of about 2km. It's outside the city. - And he hasn't called back? - No. The cell phone you are calling is not available right now. Do we know the name of the owner? - The man who made the call? - Germán Tejero Padilla. Germán Tejero Padilla. Who incidentally was stopped by highway patrol about an hour and a half ago. - Do you receive me, Officer? - Loud and clear, Sergeant. We haven't seen any signs of an accident so far. Did you stop a certain German Tejero Padilla around an hour, or hour and half ago? Yes. One of his headlamps was out and he was showing signs of fatigue. Right. And did you report him? No, Sergeant. We took him to a motel. He's the man who made the emergency call. I have to call the police. Silvia... Silvia... Help me! Please! A man tried to kill me! Silvia... Hello? Silvia? - Silvia, I know you can hear me. - Murderer! Leave me alone! I'm not a murderer! Just listen to me! I don't care what you say, you son of a bitch! You killed my friend. No! It was an accident. Do you hear me? I've been trying to help you. If you wanted to help, why did you lie to me? I didn't lie to you, Silvia! I... You said you knew who'd done it. No, no, no! You're lying again! I've got your wallet and I know your name... German. I know where you live. I'm going to tell the police and you're going to rot in jail. You can't bring us down! Where's Daddy going to sleep? What do you mean where? Here at home. Daddy will be home soon, OK? - Can I wait up for him? - No, you can't. Come on, bed time. In you get. - Mommy? - Yes? Doesn't Daddy love us? Of course he does, sweetie. Daddy loves us very much. Why do you say that? I don't want anything bad to happen to him. I'm scared not knowing where he is. Don't be scared. Do you want me to read you a story? Yes? We haven't done that for a while. This one? Help! Help me, please! Open the door! Help! Please help me! He's going to kill me! Help! Don't be stupid, how they hell could they have got home? On foot? So you think they've turned invisible or something? How the hell should I know? I'm going to try Silvia. That bitch really fucked up my face with her ring. Maybe we drove past them. Call them back. - They're not picking up, dude. - So fucking try again! - Shit! The cops! - What? Fuck! Fuck! Shit! What are those assholes doing out here? OK, we're cool. - Good evening. - Good evening. Is there some kind of problem? Yeah, my dick's on fire! Fuck you, pig! That'll teach you for being nosey! - Are you OK? - Those little shits! Go! Go! - Chato, you're such an asshole! - Fuck them, man! I'm not going to let them fuck up my buzz! Careful! Don't get too close! Fucking assholes! You can suck my dick! Shut the fuck up, dude! We're going to fucking end up in jail, man! - Oh yeah! We're going to jail! - Fuck, man! This way, Chato! Chato! Hey! Help me! Please! Hey! Wait! I don't believe this. Where are you going? Help! - Help! - Stop! Stop, stop! Please! Just let me talk to you! Silvia, please. We can work this out. I'm not going to follow you anymore. If you want to stay here alone, that's fine by me. I just want you to come out and talk to me for five minutes. Silvia, please come out. I know how you must be feeling. Put yourself in my shoes a moment and imagine how I'm feeling. You can't just accuse me of something like that. Silvia... Stop! Enough! No, no, no! Open up. Open the door! Open it! Open the door! Open this door! Open up! Open it! Open up! Silvia! Silvia, open the door! Open up! And they all lived happily ever after. Mommy... Yes, sweetie? Do angels sleep? Sure they do. So who protects us at night? Come on, it's time to go to sleep. Luis... I noticed German's not home yet. - No. - Has something happened? I don't know... He's not answering his phone. It's typical of him. You want to come in for a drink? I was just in here... What are you reading? "Thus spoke Zarathustra". They say Nietzsche inspired Naziism. It's about the evolution of human beings. - Evolution? - Yeah. It's about our need to overcome obstacles, to make decisions we won't regret later, to take control of our lives. - Basically about being free. - Weren't you going to offer me a drink? Yes... What do you want? - Whiskey. - OK. You do not have enough credit to make this call... HIDDEN NUMBER It's OK. Calm down. Silvia... Forgive me, Silvia. I never wanted to hurt you, I swear. Look... I've got a family. See? That's my wife, Sandra. And that's my daughter. Her name's Estela. Today was her birthday and I wasn't there. Look, I work for an insurance company. Everything's going to OK. I'll take care of all the paperwork. I'll make sure you're compensated for the accident. I don't want compensation! I want Gloria back! And it wasn't an accident, - you tried to run us over! - No... - And you lied to me. - I'm not a liar. I didn't know the truth. Who the hell walks in the middle of the road like that? With no torch, no warning, no nothing! - You were driving with no lights! - That's not true. You're lying! You always lie. Silvia, please, get back in the car. I'm begging you. I swear I'll take you to a hospital. OK? But I need your word you'll say I acted in good faith. - Good faith? - Yes. Please! If anyone sees my car, they're going to think... Think what? - Silvia, listen to me. Please. - You ran Gloria over... then tried to kill me so there'd be no witnesses. - What? Why would I do that? - So you wouldn't go to jail. Don't be ridiculous! I just told you it was an accident. No one goes to jail for accidentally running someone over. I know. I've had several similar cases. At work, I mean! Doing people's paperwork! You have to pay for what you've done. I will pay! My insurance will cover it. You don't have anything to worry about. No! I'm going to report you and you're going to go to jail! Silvia, you can't do that to me. I'm begging you, please. You want me to lose my family? Leave a little girl without her father? You're going to ruin my life! Your life? You fucking asshole! Silvia! Silvia, please! Leave it to me. You'll be compensated. You'll get loads of money. No! You can't buy me! You killed her! I didn't kill her! It was an accident! You hear me? I didn't mean to! - Why didn't you see us? - Because I fell asleep! I fell asleep! No! You killed her! Son of a bitch! Murderer! You're fucked, German! - Sandra... - German! Where the hell are you? German. - Yes... - Where are you? Aren't you going to answer me? You're not going to answer me. Don't bother coming home. What? No, no, no... Sandra, please. - I'm not in the mood for jokes right now. - I'm serious, German. I don't want you back. Stay wherever you are. - Don't come back. - Listen to me. Honey, listen. It's over. I promise I'm going to change. No, German. That's what you always say. - I'm fed up. - Shut up and listen to me! I didn't call you before because I didn't want to scare you. I had to stop because I had an accident. What? I fell asleep at the wheel. Why didn't you tell me? Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK. But... I ran over a dog. - What? - I didn't see it. Poor thing. Is it dead? Yes. It's dead. Honey, my battery's about to die. I'll be home as soon as I can. I love you both so much. Sandra, I love you. Me too. He had an accident. He killed a dog. But he's OK. He's OK. - It's all OK. - I was really scared. Come here. Son of a bitch! You killed my friend! Stand up to them! You killed her! They walk all over you! No... No... You're a fucking murderer! No! I'm going to report you and you're going to go to jail! No! I said no! I'm sorry. Help! - Evening, Sergeant. - How's it going? Any news? No. No sign of the accident. But we had an incident with two kids who've run off. We've got their license plate number though. Help! OK. Give up the search and go back to your post. Roger that. Stop! Please! No! Please, no! No! Why did you have to make this so difficult? I never wanted to hurt you! I have a wife and a daughter. I can't leave them alone. Understand? I can't lose them. What happened to you? Hey, little one! What are you doing up so early? I couldn't sleep anymore. - Is that my gift? - Yes, but let's open it later, when Mommy wakes up. Did you have fun at your party yesterday? Yeah? I wish I'd been there. What? - What was that for? - You look sad. Silvia? Silvia? MOM Mommy? Daddy's awake. Can I open my gift now? No. Wait for a bit, OK? Daddy has to tell me something. Come on. Back inside. What do you mean a dog? Yes. Apparently so, Sergeant. His wife says he got distracted and ran over a dog. He panicked and called 911. And the ambulance? Did he think the paramedics were going to take the dog to hospital? Who knows, Sergeant? Would you believe it? What a waste of time! You'd better get back to some real work. A dog... A dog! There are some real nutcases out there! They want a list of all claims made to this office. Each one with its corresponding written claim and accident report. They want to limit our responsibility and reduce our staff and we're making it easy for them! Don't worry, Don Manuel. I'll talk to German right away and get to the bottom of this. Eduardo, stop trying to pass the buck! You don't appear to have a clue what's going on. German handed in his report last week! Son of a bitch! He's going to pay for this. German, did you know...? Where the hell is German? - Lunch is ready! - Coming! EDUARDO WORK INCOMING CALL - Lunch time! - For blackmail and kidnapping... - The four young men accused of... - Who was that? Someone who's forgotten I've taken the day off. - Beer? - Yes, please. One year since the disappearance of Silvia Bellaton and Gloria Sendoa. Since their bodies were found dumped in an area of marshland, mutilated and showing signs of violence, many theories have been put forward, but according to police sources, the most likely motive is still thought to be sexual. At midday today, two young men testified at a provisional hearing. Mario Casona and Arturo Garay, alias "Chato", were friends of the victims and are still the number one suspects. Both have criminal records and appear to have been with the girls the night of their disappearance. Honey... I was thinking, why don't we take a trip somewhere? Like we used to. Here. Let's eat. The guests will be here soon. Estela! Come and eat, sweetie. Leave the balloons. When's the party starting? When you finish all that, without making a mess, your friends will start arriving. - Are you excited? - Yes! How come! You want an olive? Eat up. Careful your tooth doesn't fall out!
