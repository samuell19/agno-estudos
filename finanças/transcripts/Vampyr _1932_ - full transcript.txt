VAMPYR was produced in 1931/32 in German, French and English versions. The original negative for picture and sound was lost. Partially complete prints of the German and French versions served as the basis for this restoration. The new German version of 1998 was a collaboration between Cineteca del Comune di Bologna, Deutsche Kinemathek and ZDF/Arte. This is the tale of the strange adventures of young Allan Gray, who immersed himself in the study of devil worship and vampires. Preoccupied with superstitions of centuries past, he became a dreamer for whom the line between the real and the supernatural became blurred. His aimless wanderings led him late one evening to a secluded inn by the river in a village called Courtempierre. Who's there? Go around. It was an eerie moonlit night. Light and shadow, voices and faces seemed to take on hidden meaning. Allan Gray felt a sinister force descend upon him. In vain he fought the terror that seized him, and fear of things he could not name haunted his restless sleep. Who are you? Quiet. She must die. You understand? TO BE OPENED... UPON MY DEATH What was going on? What terrifying secret was unfolding? Allan Gray felt certain of one thing: A soul in mortal distress was crying out for help, and a voice within urged him to heed that call. Silence. Did you hear that? Yes. The child. There's no child here. But the dogs. There are no children or dogs here. He followed the fleeting shadows and came to a large estate where a forlorn manor rose up among ancient trees. Here, in seclusion, with only his two daughters and a few servants for company, lived the man who had appeared to Allan Gray earlier at the inn. The wounds have almost healed. The blood. Don't go to bed until the doctor arrives. Open up. Hurry. For heavers sake, hurry. I'm coming. What's wrong? What is it? Quick. They're trying to kill him. The other door. Jeanne, light the lamps in the library. And you stay with Gis?le, you hear? Is he dead? Won't you please stay here with us? Where is he going? To the police. TO BE OPENED UPON MY DEATH THE STRANGE HISTORY OF VAMPIRES Accounts from many ages and lands tell of terrible demons called vampires. These are the bodies and souls of the dead whose terrible deeds in life deny them repose in the grave. Under the bright light of the full moon, they rise from their graves to suck the blood of children and young adults and thus prolong their shadowy existence. The Prince of Darkness is their ally and lends them supernatural power among the living and the dead. At night these creatures from the abyss haunt the abodes of the living, where they sow death and decay. A vampire's victim is doomed to perish without hope. A wound on the throat, as from the bite of a cat or rat, is the mark of damnation. Neither medical science... Where? There, outside. Hurry. Quick. Like a plague, the vampire's lust infects the victim, who is torn between a thirst for blood and a desperate repulsion toward this craving. The innocent young person itself becomes a vampire and seeks to prey on its nearest and dearest. Entire families, even entire villages, are thus brought under the curse. If I could only die. No, L?one. I know. I'm lost. I'm damned. I think she's dying. Didn't you hear a scream? Come. The carriage is back. She's asleep. Good God. What is that? See that? Blood. The ghosts of executed criminals are in their service, but the living too may fall under their dreadful sway. An account from Hungary tells of a village doctor who, having sold his soul to the Evil One, became a vampire's henchman and thus an accessory to a series of horrid crimes in that region. Good evening, Doctor. Good evening. How is she doing? - Not well at all. - Why is that? We found her out on the grounds. Well, let's go see. She has another of those marks on her neck. We'll have a look. Good evening. Come along. You stay down here. She's doing very poorly. - Pulse? - Weak. Can't she be saved? Perhaps. But she needs blood. It must be human blood. Are you willing to give her your own? Come, young man. I'll draw your blood. Why does the doctor always come at night? Once the vampire has gained complete control over its victim, it seeks to drive the victim to suicide, thus delivering that soul to the Evil One. For he who takes his own life is lost for all eternity. To him the Golden Gates of Heaven are closed. For him all hope is lost. Sister. Come here a moment. You may go to bed now. Did you hear me? Who can solve the riddle of life and death or fathom the dark secrets hidden from the light of day? For just as strange as a vampire's existence is the manner of its demise. These dead who cannot find peace must be murdered to deliver a tormented humanity from their grip. Many monasteries and libraries possess in their secret archives... What's wrong? I'm losing blood. Nonsense. Your blood is right here. ...accounts of how vampires have been rendered harmless in many places. In the village of Kisilova, haunted a generation ago by a vampire in the form of an old woman, the following procedure was used: At dawn the grave was opened, and the old woman was found lying as if asleep. An iron stake was driven through her heart, nailing her horrid soul to the earth. She then died a true death, and the curse that had lain upon herself and her victims was broken. Come... follow me. We shall become one soul, one blood. Follow me. Death is waiting... ...deliverance by the grace of our heavenly Lord. Even in these parts, tradition tells how certain areas were haunted by vampires. Just 25 years ago, a murderous epidemic claimed 1 1 victims in the village of Courtempierre. Doctors assigned the plague a medical name, but a persistent rumour circulated among the people that a vampire was the cause of the scourge. Many firmly believed that vampire to be none other than Marguerite Chopin, who lay buried in the village cemetery. All her life, Marguerite Chopin had been a monster in human form. She died an unrepentant soul, and the Church denied her the Last Sacraments. Come quickly. Something terrible is happening. Come quickly. Sister. I'm afraid of dying. I am damned. My God. Sister. She must die. She must live until sunrise, you understand? FROM DUST THOU ART UNTO DUST THOU SHALT RETURN Now go. Quickly. I feel strong. My soul is free. You're here. Open this. You hear me? Listen to me. Listen to me. Curse you, you swine. Open up. Let me out of here. Open this gate. Over here. This way.
