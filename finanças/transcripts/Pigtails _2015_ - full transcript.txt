Can we hold it tighter over there? Aren't we holding on a bit too tightly? You'll leave marks! Red pegs are old and weak. They're on their way to the trash. - Us Reds are being left behind. - Like we're redundant. Being older doesn't make you Reds lord of the manor. We Whites do the hard work. Show some respect. Newbies should just shut up and sweat. Ouch! No! Get away from me! Smash 'em! Smash 'em! Time to replace White. How about getting rid of Red and Blue, too? Nobody's using them. So, it's time for the weekly inspection. Oops! Nice to meet you. Manners, anybody? Have you lived here long? You sure look worn-out. Their role is done. They were like this when I arrived. Then why not toss them away? They look miserable. Indeed. Duty calls! - Good night, Mr. Tube. - Sweet dreams, new face. Good night... ...Dad and Mum. How mundane... No mail for ages. Wait... Something for us? A clear sky, after rain all week... Hmm? Nothing again? No stamp... This must be a very special letter, then. Right. Go and give it to her personally. With or without mail delivery, I keep myself busy, you see. Gosh, you're a wreck. My days are numbered. Tell me something I don't know. I will. TV and radio are forbidden here. Huh? If the inspectors find you, you'll go straight to the junkyard. So how do you get news from outside? Don't you want to know the truth? What for? This place is under special protection. Bizarre. This isn't inspection day. - Why this sudden visit? - A surprise inspection? They left meds too. You want to find out the truth? Oh, please. Telly's nought but lies. Making up all those great big stories. It's all silly chats and fuss about nothing. You live a healthier life without it. What's this "truth"? Sensationally horrific news? Well, our truth is already here. Wait! - Stop! - They don't need you! Can't he just fade away quietly? Stubborn old thing! Go ahead. Last chance to show your "truth", if you can. You have to keep on living Like you promised when you were a child Tempted by sweet candy You broke your hardened shell Under a pastel dress the frills of the heart flutter about Somewhere someone is looking this way Haven't heard a song this side in forever... - She's going to bed early today. - Must be really tired. - So that's her favourite. - Isn't it from outside the wall? Who would ever release balloons, anyway? Hey, are there people in your world too? Please tell us. Mr. Balloon? Quiet fellow, huh? What do you expect? He's empty inside. Are you crying? They shot down all his friends. Sorry for saying you're empty. Did I wake you? - It's OK. - No problem. So, you can talk. I just... didn't want to. Not about the other side. How so? We always get gathered for parties. Parties? Those to welcome people coming from the Farm. The Farm? It's what we call the world over this side. They eat lovely food, and have a lot of fun. We want them to enjoy their last moments. After the party, everyone is given a private room. And await their turn. Our people are all missing some part. An arm, a leg... They need those from the Farm for replacements. Of course, it's not free. Only the rich can afford it. Everyone gets the part they need. Nothing is wasted. - They slice people up? - That's horrible... It is. Is it? You can keep your body all for yourself. Or you could share it, to help many other people. Which way would make God happier? The seams in my tired body are falling apart. But my cotton can still be useful. I could share it with depleted toys. And my cloth can be used to make new ones. I see, but... If a life is made up of many different things, don't you think it ought to return as much as it received? Go! We don't want to lose you, either. We've been together ever since that day. But now... run! - Flee! - Go! Go! - Go! -Go! - Go! -Go! Just go. Get away from here. We want to help you. That'd make us happy. Don't mind me. This is my purpose. So you decided to stay. Are you sure? Very soon they'll cut you into pieces. Aren't you afraid to die? Things exist to be used by people. But people...? You? You're staying on for all those awaiting, aren't you? Farewell, Pigtails. I will think on this, too. About happiness. If God dies one day Leaving this world covered in ice We'll have to awaken from our sweet dreams And start looking for the sun Unsure where to go Ignoring eternity Do you remember our secret Whispered on a tiny island A long time ago It tempted us more than a forbidden fruit And look at us now The wind brings memories The roar of the sea a cross the air Is coming so close Your body starts floating Then it climbs up a little high The sky is just there Adrift in the darkness It's in a hand holding another That we'll see what we had lost Can you hear? Music is born Can you hear? Music is playing Can you hear? Music is...
