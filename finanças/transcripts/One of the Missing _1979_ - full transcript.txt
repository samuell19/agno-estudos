Ladies and gentlemen, your host, Mr. Charles Durning. Probably no conflict in American history has been more romanticized than the Civil War. Perhaps no author sought to demolish that notion like Ambrose Bierce. Bierce was a contemporary of Mark Twain, and some consider him our first anti-war protester. He served in the Union Army and experienced this human wreckage of combat firsthand. Afterwards, he went to join the young William Randolph Hearst at the San Francisco Examiner. But it's in his collection of short stories called, Tales of Soldiers, that Bierce assaults the arrogance and pomposity of the men, the women, and glories of war, not only the Civil War, but all war. This story is from that collection. It's an expanded interpretation of Bierce's extraordinary tale, "One of the Missing." In it, filmmaker JD Feigelson uses the Bierce hallmark of bitter irony to depict a routine reconnaissance mission that descends into raw battlefield terror. "One of the Missing" premiered on public television in the spring of 1979. And what you're about to see is a complete digital restoration, but then an additional four minutes not seen in the original telecast. For those who watched it before and those who have never seen it, here is the original director's cut of "One of the missing." [drums playing] [birds sounding] [drums sounding] [music playing] (SINGING) The trees, they do grow high. The grass, it does grow green. The shadow of the leaves hide a fear unseen, a fear that's only known within the coward's breast, all for the sake of his killing. [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [music playing] (SINGING) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh-- [gunshot] [music playing] Cannon! [dramatic music] Howard! [dramatic music and dog barking] Searing? Major needs a sharpshooter up on the line. Hep, hut. [cicadas buzzing] [birds sounding] Are you the sharpshooter? Yes, sir. Private Jerome, sir. Well, we Yanks been quiet for quite a while now. Some of the boys up on our picket line think they heard them pulling back. If he's out there, he's damn sure quiet. Searing, I need a man to go out there and take a look. That going to be you? Yes, sir, I reckon so. Good, good. You go through our picket out in the woods. Find out if Yank has moved back. If he has, keep on going till you contact him. Find out where he is. And when you do, come back and report to me. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Well, all right, get going. [dramatic music] Well, that's the last of him. Yeah, I sure wish I had his rifle, though. Well, then Yanks may hurt somebody with it. [dramatic music] [birds chirping] [dramatic music] [fly buzzing] [music playing] [creaking] [music playing] [bugs sounding] [creaking] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [bugs sounding] [dramatic music] [wind blowing] [music playing] Hey, nigger. You're up there? I know you're hit. Come on down. I want to help you. You don't want to bleed to death, do you, boy? Hey, nigger, you hear me? [music playing] [creaking] [music playing] [distant gunfire] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [water gurgling] [scraping] [music playing] (SINGING) Father in heaven, I have done no wrong. A soldier must take life even from the young. My open grave await, it's darkness I do fear, all for the sake of my killing. [bird sounding] [music playing] Man that is born of woman has a few days and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower and is cut down. He flee-eth also as a shadow and continueth not. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass. [music playing] [cicadas buzzing] [dramatic music] [gunshot] [birds chirping] [suspenseful music] Oh. Oh. Oh. [groaning and music playing] [music playing] [door closing] [keys jingling] [footsteps] [rubbing] [thud] [footsteps] [dramatic music] [knock at door] [footsteps] Hey, cracker. You ain't dead. I know you ain't dead because I heard you're making noises in here. So open your eye and see what I got for you. You understand I got to use this. Some of your boys might hear a shot. [dramatic music] Hey. What kind of mess you got yourself in? Now, ain't that just something? I couldn't of rigged that up better my own self. And if you move just a little bit, it's going to blow your head clean off. [laughs] Now ain't that something? No, sir, I couldn't have rigged that up better my own self. [laughing] [door shuts] [music playing] [children's voices] [music playing] Hey, Jerome, come on. We're going down to Dead Man's Cave. Come on, Jerome. Come on. Come on, Jerome. OK. Yay. Hey. [music playing] (SINGING) As the twig is bent, so the tree must grow. In the time of youth, the seeds of fear we sow. And when this fear has grown, my time of hope is past, all for the sake of his killing. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. [dramatic music] (CHANTING) Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. [dramatic music] Jerome is a coward. Jerome is-- [dramatic music] Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. [music playing] [suspenseful music] [groaning] [suspenseful music] [mouse sqeaking] Get! Get out of here. Go home, damn it. [suspenseful music] [mouse squeaking] Damn you, get away from there. This is none of your business. Damn you, get out of here. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll kill you. [suspenseful music] [crickets chirping] Daddy Daddy. [bugs and birds sounding] Daddy! Where you've been, Daddy? I've been looking all up and down the creek for you. I seen Early Pickett back a ways. He said he's seen you going this way not far back. So I figured I'd find you around here somewheres. You're still-- I mean you're not-- Ginny. What's the matter, Daddy? You're acting so funny. [BUGS SOUNDING AND BIRDS CHIRPING] I must have fallen asleep here. Come with me, Daddy. Let's leave this place. [music playing] (SINGING) Father, dear Father, come and take my hand. We will stroll the meadow and walk through wooded land. Leave your fears behind you. Come and go with me. All for the sake of your daughter. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. [cicadas buzzing] [music playing] Ginny, you can't imagine how terrible that dream was. I knew that I was going to die. And I was scared. Ginny, I-- I was a coward. Everybody's scared of dying, but that don't mean you're a coward. I know. But-- but this was different. This was like when I was a little boy. And I was scared to go near a dead man's cave. And I was scared like a little boy. And those are the kids. They knew. And they knew I was a coward. Daddy, you're not a coward. And let's not talk about your silly old dream anymore. It's so nice out here, I don't want to ruin it. [BIRDS CHIRPING AND BUGS SOUNDING] Come on, Daddy. Let's go across the creek. Oh! [dramatic music] Oh! Oh! [coughing] Help! [dramatic music] Oh! [cries and coughs] [dramatic music] Daddy! Daddy! [dramatic music] (CHANTING) Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. Jerome is a coward. No. No, I'm not. I'm not a coward. I'll help you, Ginny. Hang on. Daddy's coming. He'll be all right. Daddy's coming. [music playing] [snap] [music playing] [knocking] [music playing] [dramatic music] [click] [gasping] [music playing] (SINGING) With a rifle in his hand, he wore a coat of gray. With an unforgiving heart, he murdered just for play. In fate's final scheme, on his grave the grass grew green. And death put an end to his killing.
